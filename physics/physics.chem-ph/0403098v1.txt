Conductivity and Viscosity
Measurements for Binary Lysozyme
Chloride Aqueous Solution and
Ternary Lysozyme-Salt-Water
Solution

Daniela Buzatu∗, Emil Petrescu∗, Florin D. Buzatu†

Abstract

We use the conductimetric method, adequate to electrolytes, to de-
termine the lysozyme charge in lys-water and ternary lys-salt-water
systems. We measured also the viscosities for the above binary and
ternary systems in the same conditions at pH= 4.5 and T= 298 K,
measurements that allow us to see any eﬀect of viscosity on cations
mobilities and implicitly on the lysozyme charge. The method is il-
lustrated for the lysozyme chloride aqueous solution system at 25o C,
using the data reported here for pH= 4.5 at 0.15, 0.6, 0.8, 1., 1.5,
2., 2.5, 3., 3.5 mM (mg/mL) lysozyme chloride concentrations. The
method was also applied to ternary lys-salt-water systems in the same
conditions at pH= 4.5 and T= 25o C. Ternary conductivities are re-
ported for a mean concentration 0.6 mM of lysozyme chloride in all
systems and a mean concentration 0.01, 0.025, 0.05, 0.1, 0.175, 0.2,
0.5, 0.7, 0.9, 1.2, 1.3 and 1.4 M for NaCl; 0.005, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.175,
0.2, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4 and 1.5 M for KCl; 0.005, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1,
0.175, 0.2, 0.5, 0.7, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6 and 1.7 M for NH4Cl.

Motivation

In order to determine the protein structure through X-ray diﬀraction, high
quality crystals are required. The protein crystallization process usually oc-
curs in aqueous solution that contain salts as precipitant agents. The phys-
ical and chemical properties of these solutions aﬀect drastically the nucle-
ation and crystal growth processes. Protein aggregation depends on protein-
protein and protein-precipitant interactions in the solution. In these inter-
actions, the eﬀective charge of the protein plays an important role. From
titration experiments [1] only the stoichiometric value of the protein charge
can be determine, but it does not take into account the presence of ions
that may bind on the macromolecules and change their net charge as already
shown by diﬀusion experiments [2].
A more direct way to estimate the protein charge for diﬀerent salts concen-
trations is based on conductimetric experiments. The conductivity [16, 17] of
the protein-salt aqueous systems is function of the mobility and of the ionic
charge species present in solution and it seems to be very sensitive to charge
changes of the protein. These changes are inﬂuenced by modiﬁcations in pH,
salt concentrations and the type of the used salt.

Theoretical Background

Assuming that the lysozyme chloride is an electrolyte with the chemical for-
mula LyszpCl−
zp, the conductivity for a ternary system LyszpCl−
zp-Salt-Water
can be expressed as:

σsol = cpF (zpup + zpu−) + csaltF (u+ + u−)

(1)

where cp is the protein concentration, F= 96484 C/mol is the Faraday con-
stant, up, u− and u+ are the mobilities of the protein complex ion, the neg-
ative and positive ion of the used salt in the solution, respectively. Using
the Stoke’s law and the deﬁnition of the ion mobility, we can express the ion
mobility in terms of the viscosity of the medium and of the radius ri of the
ion in the solution (by considering the ion a hard sphere). We assume also
the radius of the ions doesn’t change with the salt concentration at very low
protein concentrations (0.6 mM in our case).

Experimental section

All the experimental work was performed at Texas Christian University,
Chemistry Department.

Materials. The materials, solution preparation, density and pH measure-
ments are all described in the Ref. [2]. We used a hen egg-white lysozyme,
recrystallized six times, purchased from Seikagaku America. The choice of
the supplier was guided by the work of Rosenberger and co-workers [4, 5, 6]
who reported detailed analysis of commercial HEWL products.
The molecular mass of the isoelectric lysozyme solute, Mlys, was taken as
14307 g/mol [7], and this value was used to calculate all concentrations after
correction for the moisture and chloride content. Buoyancy corrections were
made with the commonly used lysozyme crystal density [8, 9, 10] of 1.305
g/cm3.
Deionized water was distilled and then passed through a four-stage Milli-
pore ﬁlter system to provide high-purity water for all the experiments. The
molecular mass of water, Mwater, was taken as 18.015 g/cm3. Mallinckrodt
12 M) was diluted by half with pure water and distilled at
reagent HCl (
the constant boiling composition. The resulting HCl solution (
6 M) was
then diluted to about 0.063 M (pH 1.2) and used to adjust the pH of the
solution.
Following the work of Rard [11], Mallinckrodt AR NaCl and KCl were dried
by heating at 450o C for 7 h, and used without further puriﬁcation. Mallinck-
rodt AR NH4Cl was dried heating it at 70o C for 7 h under vacuum. The
purity of the salts were listed as 99.9% by the supplier. The molecular mass
for NaCl, KCl and NH4Cl, Msalt, were taken to be respectively 58.443 g/mol,
74.55 g/mol and 53.49 g/mol, and their crystal density [12] as 2.165 g/cm3,
1.984 g/cm3 and 1.527 g/cm3 for buoyancy corrections.

Preparation of Solutions. All solutions were prepared by mass with ap-
propriate buoyancy corrections. All weighings were performed with a Met-
tler Toledo AT400 electrobalance. Since the as-received lysozyme powder
was very hygroscopic, all manipulations in which water absorption might be

4

critical were performed in a dry glove box. Stock solutions of lysozyme were
made by adding as-received protein to a pre-weighted bottle that had con-
tained dry box air, capping the bottle, and reweighing to get the weight and
thus mass of lysozyme. Water was added to dissolve the lysozyme, and the
solution was weighed. An accurate density measurement was made and used
to obtain the molarity of the stock solution.
For binary experiments, the solutions were ﬁrst diluted to within 10 cm3 of
the ﬁnal volumes with pure water. From 1 to 3 mL of the dilute HCl was
added to adjust the pH to the desired value, any residual solution on the pH
electrode was washed back into the solutions, and the dilutions were com-
pleted by mass. The densities and ﬁnal pH values of these solutions were
measured and the ﬁnal concentrations were calculated.
For ternary experiments, precise masses of NaCl, KCl and NH4Cl were added
to ﬂasks containing previously weighed quantities of lysozyme stock solutions.
These solutions were mixed and diluted to within 10 cm3 of the ﬁnal volume.
The pH was adjusted, and the solutions were diluted to their ﬁnal mass.

pH Measurements. The pH measurements were done using a Corning
model 130 pH meter with an Orion model 8102 combination ROSS pH elec-
trode. The meter was calibrated with standard pH 7 and pH 4 buﬀers and
checked against a pH 5 standard buﬀer. It was assumed that the pH values
remaind valid at higher NaCl, KCl and NH4Cl concentrations. After four
or ﬁve experiments, the electrode was soaked in 5% NaClO for 10 min, and
then the internal reference solution was replaced with fresh solution.

Density Measurements. All density measurements were performed with a
Mettler-Paar DMA40 density meter, with an RS-232 output to a Apple Π+.
By time averaging the output, a precision of 0.00001 g/cm3 or better could
be achieved. The temperature of the vibrating tube in the density meter was
controlled with water from a large well-regulated water bath whose temper-
ature was 25.00

0.01 o C.

±

Conductivity and Viscosity Measurements. We performed measure-
ments on conductivity for ternary systems: Lys-NaCl-Water, Lys-KCl-Water
and Lys-NH4Cl-Water, and for binary Lys-Water using a pair of capillarity
cells characterized by the length (l) and cross section (S), and 8 silver-chloride
electrodes; 2 current carrying electrodes, 2 bridge electrodes between cells
and 4 probe electrodes.

The DC-current intensity (I) and the drop tension (U) were determined using
a AMEL-Instruments galvanostat for very low current intensity (µA) and a
Hewlett Packard multimeter which allowed us to measure very high resis-
tance (MΩ) corresponding to very low concentration of the studied solutions
(mM). The internal resistance of multimeter was adjusted to a value bigger
than 10 GΩ. Thus, the measurements of the drop tensions on systems with
a resistance of 10 MΩ are not aﬀected by signiﬁcant errors.
In order to determine the geometrical factor of the cells, we calibrated them
with KCl (very high purity) solution for a large range of the concentration
(0.5 mM up to 1.5 M).
The binary and ternary protein solutions, and the binary salt-water systems
were prepared as we described above, at the same pH=4.5; conductivities
and viscosities were measured at T= 25o C with a very good accuracy.
Ternary conductivities are reported for a mean concentration 0.6 mM of
lysozyme chloride in all systems and a mean concentration 0.01, 0.025, 0.05,
0.1, 0.175, 0.2, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9, 1.2, 1.3 and 1.4 M for NaCl; 0.005, 0.01, 0.05,

0.1, 0.175, 0.2, 0.5, 0.7, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6 and 1.7 M for NH4Cl.
Binary conductivities for Lysozyme chloride-Water are reported for a mean
concentration 0.15, 0.6, 0.8, 1., 1.5, 2., 2.5, 3., 3.5 mM of lysozyme chloride.
Binary conductivities for Salt-Water are reported for the same concentra-
tions used in the ternary solutions.
For the same binary and ternary systems we performed measurements of vis-
cosity using an Ostwald viscosimeter.

Results

Binary lysozyme-water conductivity. Conductivities were determined
from Eq. (10) the in the concentration range from 0.15 mM to 3.5 mM using
the experimental data for DC-current intensity (I), the drop tension (U) on
the cells and the diameter of the all conductivity cells d = 2 mm:

In Fig. 4 is plotted the ratio ηsalt/ηsol and the lysozyme eﬀect on viscosity
can be observed. For csalt > 0.05 M the lysozyme has a constant eﬀect on all
the three salts.
Using the Eq. (9), we calculated also the lysozyme charge dependence on
salt concentrations; the results are shown in Table 1.
The propagation of errors was done assuming an error δσ = 0.01 S/m esti-
mated by the least square on raw data. We do not consider any systematic
error associated to the model or to the binary salt conductivities.
In the Fig. 5 are plotted the values obtained for lysozyme charge versus the
salt concentration. The graph shows a higher dependence of the lysozyme
charge on KCl and NH4Cl salt concentrations than in the NaCl case; it follows
zp depends on type of salt.
This behavior may be connected with the dependence of the mobility ratio
Lys/Cation (up/u+) on the salt concentrations as it is shown in Fig. 6.

The lysozyme charge values in the case when the salt concentration goes to
zero in ternary systems, are: zp = 7.12 for ternary Lys-NaCl-Water solu-
tion, zp < 6.42 for ternary Lys-KCl-Water solution and zp = 5.95 for ternary
Lys-NH4Cl-Water solution. We can compare the value of zp obtained for
Lys-NaCl-Water by conductimetric method with the value zp = 8.9 obtained
from thermodynamic data applied to precision ternary diﬀusion data for the
same system [14].

Conclusions

In the present paper we calculated the protein charge by using, for the ﬁrst
time in our knowledge, a conductimetric method to binary lysozyme-water,
and ternary lys-salt-water systems for diﬀerent salts, at diﬀerent salt con-
centrations. We used also the experimental values of viscosities for the same
binary and ternary systems at pH= 4.5 and T= 298 K. We determined the
protein charge zp from Eq. (9) where we introduced all the experimental

11

data.
From binary lys-water conductivities data we obtained a value of zp =7.9
for lysozyme charge at inﬁnite dilution, instad of zp =6.7 received from ex-
trapolated limiting diﬀusion coeﬃcients for aqueous lysozyme chloride [2] at
pH= 4.5 and T= 298 K (these limiting values of the diﬀusion coeﬃcients
were obtained by extrapolating the diﬀusion coeﬃcients measured at low,
but nonzero, concentrations of protein). Our value zp should be compare
with zp =3.9 obtained by a Harned-type analysis [15], in which the charge
in the Debye-H¨uckel limiting law was adjusted to match the concentration
dependence of the difussion data [2].
From ternary lys-salt-water systems conductivities data we received the folow-
ing values: zp = 7.12 from Lys-NaCl-Water, zp < 6.42 from Lys-KCl-Water,
and zp = 5.95 from Lys-HN4Cl-Water and we can compare with zp = 8.9
obtained at higher lysozyme concentrations from thermodinamic data for
Lys-NaCl-Water system [14] at pH= 4.5 and T= 298 K.
The obtained experimental data for binary lys-water, salt-water and ternary
lys-salt-water viscosities, allowed us to calculate the mobilities of positive
ions and to compare the dependence of the ratio lys/cation mobility (up/u+)
of the salt concentrations and to presume its inﬂuence on the protein charge
dependence for all three ternary systems (Fig. 5 and Fig. 6).

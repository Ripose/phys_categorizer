Abstract

The H + LiF(X 1Σ+, v = 0 − 2, j = 0) → HF(X 1Σ+, v′, j′) + Li(2S) bimolecular process is in-

vestigated by means of quantum scattering calculations on the chemically accurate X 2A′ LiHF

potential energy surface of Aguado et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 119, 10088 (2003)]. Calculations have

been performed for zero total angular momentum for translational energies from 10−7 to 10−1 eV.

Initial-state selected reaction probabilities and cross sections are characterized by resonances orig-

inating from the decay of metastable states of the H · · · F − Li and Li · · · F − H van der Waals

complexes. Extensive assignment of the resonances has been carried out by performing quasi-

bound states calculations in the entrance and exit channel wells. Chemical reactivity is found

to be signiﬁcantly enhanced by vibrational excitation at low temperatures, although reactivity

appears much less favorable than non-reactive processes due to the ineﬃcient tunneling of the

relatively heavy ﬂuorine atom strongly bound in van der Waals complexes.

INTRODUCTION

Quantum mechanical tunneling through an energy barrier has long been recognized as an

important process in a variety of chemical reactions [1]. Recently, evidences for tunneling in

reactions have been reported, for instance, in enzymology [2], organic [3], atmospheric [4],

and interstellar chemistry [5]. This mechanism is also being investigated at cold and ultra-

cold temperatures in the context of chemical reactivity involving Bose-Einstein condensates

(BEC) of diatomic molecules [6, 7, 8] where tunneling is thought to be the dominant reactive

process [9, 10, 11, 12].

Analysis of subthreshold resonances in the energy dependence of reaction cross sections

can provide important insight into the reaction mechanism as illustrated recently for FH2

[13, 14], HOCl [15, 16], HCl2[17] and LiHF [18, 19, 20]. For these systems, resonances were

attributed to the decay of quasibound van der Waals complexes in the entrance and/or exit

channels of the reaction. The LiHF system is especially interesting since at low temperatures

where tunneling is preponderant, the reaction pathway between the H + LiF and Li + HF

arrangements involves the transfer of the relatively heavy F atom. The LiH + F product

channel is highly endoergic and is not accessible at low energies. The LiHF system has

been extensively studied experimentally and theoretically. Indeed, after the original crossed

beam measurement of Taylor and Datz [21], the Li + HF reaction became a prototype for

experimental investigation of the “harpoon” mechanism [22] and many measurements of the

integral and diﬀerential reactive cross sections have been reported [23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28,

29, 30, 31]. Moreover, LiHF is particularly amenable to ab initio calculations of chemical

accuracy, therefore explaining the variety of potential energy surfaces (PESs) available for

the X 2A′ symmetry electronic ground state [32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43,

44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49]. A large number of quantum mechanical [19, 20, 25, 26, 27, 28,

32, 33, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55] and classical trajectory [27, 56] scattering calculations have

been performed on these PESs for the Li + HF collision. In contrast, the H + LiF collision

has received no theoretical and experimental attention, to the best of our knowledge. The

lack of experimental results may be explained by the diﬃculty in working with metastable

hydrogen atom sources in crossed beams experiments.

In this work, we present quantum scattering calculations on the X 2A′ LiHF electronic

ground state for the H + LiF(X 1Σ+, v = 0 − 2, j = 0) → HF(X 1Σ+, v′, j′) + Li(2S) reaction.

Calculations have been performed for zero total angular momentum using the recent high

accuracy global PES of Aguado et al. [49]. In the context of our study of the reverse reaction

[20], particular eﬀort is made here to assign resonances due to the decay of metastable states

in van der Waals wells of the entrance and exit channels. The LiHF electronic ground state

is typical of alkali metal halides with a saddle point resulting from the crossing of the
Li+ + HF− ionic state and a covalent conﬁguration correlating to Li(2S) + HF(X 1Σ+). The

strong dipole electric ﬁeld of the products is at the origin of an exceptionally deep van

der Waals minimum of about 0.24 eV for the Li · · · F − H complex, while the H · · · F − Li

complex in the entrance channel is about 0.07 eV deep. These van der Waals wells give rise

to long-lived collision complexes and narrow scattering resonances in the energy dependence

of reaction probabilities. Since H + LiF → HF + Li involves the transfer of the relatively

heavy F atom, it will be of particular interest to see whether the reaction will occur with

signiﬁcant rate coeﬃcient at low energies and how resonances due to tunneling aﬀect reaction

rates.

In Sec. II, we give a summary of the principal features of the PES of Aguado et al. [49],

followed by a concise review of quantum scattering theory and convergence tests assessing

the validity of our numerical results. Initial-state-selected probabilities, cross sections, cu-

mulative reaction probabilities as well as rate coeﬃcients for both reactive and non-reactive

open channels of the collision are presented in Sec. III. We also provide a detailed analysis

of the resonances present in the energy depencence of cross sections by means of quasibound

state calculations of the van der Waals complexes formed in the reagent and product chan-

nels. The eﬀect of vibrational excitation on chemical reactivity at low temperatures and

the contribution of resonances in reaction rates are discussed. Finally, a summary of our

ﬁndings is given in Sec. IV.

II. CALCULATIONS

A. X 2A′ LiHF potential energy surface

The X 2A′ LiHF ground state PES of Aguado et al. [49] was used for the present scatter-

ing calculations. Ab initio calculations were performed for 6000 nuclear geometries at the

multireference conﬁguration interaction (MRCI) level of theory, using internally contracted

3

wave functions including all single and double excitations and the Davidson correction (+Q).
The Li+ + HF− and Li+ + H−F ionic conﬁgurations, responsible for the curve crossing lead-

ing to the LiF products in the adiabatic X 2A′ state, were adequately described using a
large atomic basis set. The crossing between the Li+ + HF− ionic state and a covalent

conﬁguration correlating to Li(2S) + HF(X 1Σ+) was found to produce a pronounced saddle

point in the Born-Oppenheimer electronic ground state. The resulting analytic PES con-

structed using the modiﬁed many-body expansion of Aguado and Paniagua [57] exhibits

deep van der Waals wells of 0.2407 eV (5.551 kcal/mol) and 0.0686 eV (1.582 kcal/mol)

corresponding to the Li · · · F − H and H · · · F − Li complexes, respectively. The saddle

point and the Li(2S) + HF products asymptote are at +0.0642 eV and −0.1861 eV, re-

spectively, relative to the H(2S) + LiF(X 1Σ+) asymptote with E = 0 corresponding to the

bottom of the LiF potential. The LiH(X 1Σ+) + F(2P ) products channel lies at +3.3839 eV

relative to the energy origin, thus this reaction channel is closed for the energy range con-

sidered in this study. The PES of Aguado et al. [49] signiﬁcantly improves on the widely

used PES of Parker et al. [50] constructed from a limited set of ab initio data. It is also

markedly diﬀerent from the recent ab initio PES of Jasper et al. [46], which exhibits a

+0.076 eV higher saddle point separating the H · · · FLi and Li · · · FH complexes and an

additional saddle point at +0.014 eV in the reagent valley. Using the PES of Aguado

et al. [49], we found that, when the zero-point energies of reactants and products are in-

cluded, the H + LiF(v = 0, j = 0) → Li + HF(v′ = 0, j′ = 0) reaction has an endoergic-

ity of 0.0112 eV (0.2588 kcal/mol), while for vibrationally excited LiF(v = 1, j = 0) and

LiF(v = 2, j = 0) reagents the reaction producing HF(v′ = 0, j′ = 0) becomes exoergic by

0.0998 eV (2.3011 kcal/mol) and 0.2089 eV (4.8170 kcal/mol), respectively.

B. Quantum scattering calculations

Quantum reactive scattering calculations were carried out using the coupled-channel hy-

perspherical coordinate method as implemented in the ABC program [58]. In this method,

the Schr¨odinger equation for the motion of three nuclei on the parametric representation of a

single Born-Oppenheimer PES is solved in Delves hyperspherical coordinates with exact re-

active scattering boundary conditions. For all arrangements of the collision products, parity-
adapted S−matrix elements, SJ,P

v′j′k′,vjk, are calculated for each (J, P, p) triple. Here, J is the

4

total angular momentum quantum number, P and p are the triatomic and diatomic parity

eigenvalues, respectively; v and j are the usual diatomic vibrational and rotational quantum

numbers and k is the helicity quantum number for the reactants, their primed counterparts

referring to the products. After transformation of the parity-adapted S−matrix elements

into their standard helicity representation, SJ

v′j′k′,vjk, initial state selected cross sections are

computed as a function of the kinetic energy, Ekin, according to

σvj(Ekin) =

where kvj is the incident channel wave vector and the helicity quantum numbers k and k′ are
restricted to the ranges 0 6 k 6 min(J, j) and 0 6 k′ 6 min(J, j′). For zero total molecular

angular momentum and s−wave scattering in the incident channel, Eq. (1) merely reduces

to a summation over the quantum number v′ and j′. The cumulative reaction reaction

probability (CRP) is also computed using the formula

NJ=0(E) = X

|SJ=0

v′j′k′,vjk(E)|2,

v′j′k′,vjk

(2)

where E is the total energy and the summation is over all open channels of the reactant and

product molecules. For J = 0, reaction rate coeﬃcients are further evaluated as the product

of the cross section and the relative velocity, as a function of the translational temperature,

T = Ekin/kB, where kB is the Boltzmann constant.

Owing to the predominance of quantum tunneling in reactions involving energy barriers

at low temperatures, reaction probabilities are generally small for translationally cold and

ultracold collisions. Therefore, extensive convergence tests have been carried out for the

initial-state-selected and state-to-state reaction probabilities of the exothermic H + LiF(v =

1, 2, j = 0) → Li + HF(v′, j′) reactions. Convergence of our scattering calculations was

checked with respect to the maximum rotational quantum number, jmax, the cut-oﬀ energy,

Emax that control the basis set size, the maximum value of the hyperradius, ρmax, and the

size of the log derivative propagation sectors, ∆ρ.

Converged reaction probability for LiF formation in H+LiF(v = 1, 2, j = 0) collisions were

obtained over the range 10−5 − 10−3 eV using the values ρmax = 25.0 a.u. and ∆ρ = 0.01 a.u.
The accuracy of our numerical results over this energy range was better than 10−10 using

a large basis set size constrained with the values of jmax = 25 and Emax = 2.5 eV. Using

5

the same values of ρmax and ∆ρ as above, the size of the basis set was further optimized

by adjusting the value of the cut-oﬀ energy. In general, the reaction probabilities are more

sensitive to the basis set parameters at low energies. We performed the basis set optimization

at an incident kinetic energy of 10−5 eV. We found that the state-to-state reactions Li +

HF(v = 1, 2, j = 0) → H + LiF(v′ = 0, j′) with Emax = 2.5 eV and Emax = 2.0 eV

resulted in nearly identical values of the reaction probabilities. The basis set corresponding

to Emax = 2.0 eV was composed of 634 basis functions. Based on these convergence tests,

values of ρmax = 25.0 a.u., ∆ρ = 0.01 a.u., jmax = 25 and Emax = 2.0 eV were adopted in

the calculations reported hereafter.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Fig. 1 shows the initial state-selected reaction probability for HF formation in H +

LiF(v = 0 − 2, j = 0) collisions as a function of the translational energy. For LiF reagent

initially in the rovibrational ground state, the reaction leading to HF formation has an

endoergicity of 0.0112 eV (0.2588 kcal/mol), thus explaining the presence of the kinetic

energy threshold in the lower panel of Fig. 1. Probability for nonreactive collisions also

exhibits a threshold near 3 × 10−4 eV (0.007 kcal/mol) associated with rotational excitation

to LiF(v = 0, j = 1). At low energies, the reaction probabilities are small, because quantum

tunneling of the ﬂuorine atom is the main reaction pathway. Vibrational excitation of LiF

signiﬁcantly enhances the reaction probability in the ultracold and cold regimes, for instance,

an energy increase of 0.109 eV from LiF(v = 1, j = 0) to LiF(v = 2, j = 0) translates in

a 350% increase of the reaction probability in the zero temperature limit. Our results also

show a dense resonance structure in the energy dependence of the reaction probability at

low energies associated with quasibound states of the H · · · F − Li and Li · · · F − H van der

Waals complexes. Assignment of these resonances will be presented further in this study.

Cross sections for s−wave elastic scattering in H + LiF(v = 0 − 2, j = 0) collisions

are displayed in Fig. 2 as a function of the incident kinetic energy. For low translational

energies, only s−wave scattering is expected to play a signiﬁcant role [59]. For collisions

involving excited LiF reagents, elastic cross sections are found to have similar values for

kinetic energies below 5 × 10−3 eV. The nearly identical values of the limiting elastic cross

sections for v = 1 and 2 suggest that vibrational excitation does not aﬀect the isotropic

6

part of the interaction potential. In the zero-temperature limit, the scattering length can

be expressed as a complex number, avj = αvj − iβvj, where the real and imaginary parts are

related to the elastic component of the S−matrix, Sel

vj, according to

where kvj is the wave vector in the incident channel. We found α10 = +9.100 ˚A and
α20 = +9.159 ˚A for v = 1 and v = 2, respectively. However, for numerical reasons, the

Wigner’s threshold law for inelastic reactive and nonreactive collisions, i. e.

is preferred over Eq. (4) to evaluate the imaginary part of the scattering length. In Eq.

(5), σin
vj is the sum of the nonreactive and reactive cross sections. Using Eq. (5), we found
β10 = 2.365 × 10−4 ˚A and β20 = 3.478 × 10−3 ˚A for v = 1 and v = 2, respectively. The total

elastic cross section in the zero energy limit is given by

which yields σel

20 = 1054.05 × 10−16 cm2 and σel

10 = 1040.58 × 10−16 cm2.

Initial-state-selected cross sections for HF formation and for nonreactive scattering in

H + LiF(v = 0 − 2, j = 0) collisions are displayed in Fig. 3 as a function of the incident

translational energy. For v = 1 and v = 2, reaction cross sections reach the Wigner regime

[60] for kinetic energies below 10−5 eV in accordance with Eq. (5). Nonreactive scattering

dominates over the complete kinetic energy range investigated, with a LiF/HF product

branching ratio of 4 for v = 1 and 15 for v = 2 in the Wigner regime. For translational

energies beyond 10−4 eV, reaction cross sections are characterized by resonant spikes due

to metastable states of the H · · · F − Li and Li · · · F − H van der Waals complexes. These

resonances tend to be washed out for reactions with vibrational excited reactants.

Assignments of the resonances in the energy dependence of the reactive cross sections in

H + LiF(v = 0 − 2, j = 0) collisions are presented in Table I. Bound- and quasi-bound states

calculations have been performed for the H · · · F − Li van der Waals potentials correlating

7

with the LiF(v = 0 − 2) manifold. The adiabatic potentials are obtained by constructing the

matrix elements of the interaction potential in a basis set of the rovibrational levels of the

LiF molecule and diagonalizing the resulting diabatic potentials as a function of the atom-

molecule separation, R. The resonance energies and the corresponding wave functions are

computed using the Fourier grid Hamiltonian (FGH) method [61, 62]. For constructing the

adiabatic potentials, we used a 20-term Legendre expansion of the interaction potential, 25

angular orientations to project out the expansion coeﬃcients, 17 Gauss-Hermite quadrature

points for the vibrational wave functions and a grid of 2000 points in the atom-molecule

separation ranging from R = 0.1 − 100 a0. Similar calculations for the Li · · · F − H exit

channel complexes have been carried out previously [20] and results for the van der Waals

potential correlating with the HF(v = 0) manifold were reported. Total energy values given

in Table I are relative to separated H + LiF system with energy origin at the bottom of the

LiF potential. Eigenenergies of the reactant and product diatoms calculated using the FGH

and ABC codes were found to be consistent within an error margin of 10−6 eV for both

H + LiF and Li + HF asymptotes. The resonances in the H · · · LiF entrance channel van

der Waals well are characterized by quantum numbers (v, j, t), where v and j are the LiF

vibrational and rotational quantum numbers, respectively, and t refers to the H − LiF(v, j)

van der Waals stretching vibration; their primed counterparts refer to resonances originating

from the Li · · · HF exit channel well. As shown in Table I, the agreement between the FGH

energy eigenvalues and the peak positions from our scattering calculations is excellent. For

v = 0, resonances are mostly due to the decay of (v′ = 0, j′, t′) metastable states of the

Li · · · HF exit channel van der Waals complex, with j′ and t′ ranging from relatively high

t′-values for j′ = 1 to the lowest-lying stretching vibrational states of j′ = 5. Resonances

attributed to the H · · · LiF(v = 0, j = 10−15, t = 1−2) states also appear for reactants in this

vibrational state. For v = 1 and v = 2, this tendency is reverted with a dominant imprint of

resonances corresponding to low−t quasibound states of the adiabatic potentials correlating

with j = 2 − 12 of the entrance channel H · · · LiF complex. For these vibrationally excited

states of the reagents, only few high-lying stretching vibrational states of the Li · · · HF exit

channel van der Waals complex give rise to resonances: j′ = 6 for v = 1 and j′ = 9 for

v = 2. Although the exit channel van der Waals well is much deeper than the entrance

channel well, the Li · · · HF exit channel complex dominates only for v = 0, while for higher

vibrational levels of the reagents, the entrance channel complex plays the major role and the

8

signature of the exit channel quasi-bound states tends to disappear. It is also interesting to

note that the resonances appear mostly in the reactive cross sections despite the fact that for

v = 1 and 2 it is the entrance channel van der Waals potential that supports the resonances.

Thus, it appears that the long lived resonances decay mostly by vibrational pre-reaction of

the quasibound states by tunneling of the F atom.

The cumulative reaction probability for HF formation in H + LiF(v = 0 − 2, j = 0)

collisions is depicted in Fig. 4 as a function of the total energy. CRP is represented over an

energy range of 0.1 eV starting from the total energy values of the LiF(v, j = 0) reagents, thus

explaining the presence of thresholds at 0.0675 eV, 0.1673 eV and 0.2764 eV, respectively,

for v = 0 − 2. The resonance structure still subsists in the CRP, but becomes less sharper

with increase in energy and vibrational excitation.

The J = 0 contribution to the reaction rate coeﬃcients for HF formation in H + LiF(v =

1, 2, j = 0) collisions is shown in Fig. 5. For v = 1, the reaction rate coeﬃcient reaches the

Wigner regime for temperatures below 0.1 K, with a ﬁnite value of 3.86×10−15 cm3 s−1 in the

zero-temperature limit. Vibrational excitation of HF to the v = 2 level enhances reactivity

by about a factor of 4 in the cold and ultracold regimes. Although rate coeﬃcients appear to

be small at low temperatures, the values are not negligible compared to those for reactions

involving tunneling of atoms lighter than ﬂuorine. This suggests that heavy atom tunneling

may play a major role at low energies, as observed recently by Zuev et al. [3] for carbon

tunneling in ring expansion reactions of 1-methylcyclobutylhalocarbenes at 8 to 25 K. In

Fig. 5, for v = 1 and v = 2, the reactivity rapidly increases beyond 3 K, however, accurate

prediction of rate coeﬃcients for higher temperatures requires calculations for J > 0 which

is beyond the scope of this work.

IV. CONCLUSION

We have investigated the scattering dynamics of the H + LiF(X 1Σ+, v = 0 − 2, j = 0) →

HF(X 1Σ+, v′, j′) + Li(2S) reaction for zero total angular momentum. Using the coupled-

channel hyperspherical coordinate method, probabilities, cross sections, and rate coeﬃcients

have been computed from the zero-temperature limit up to a translational energy of 0.1 eV

using the most recent PES for the LiHF electronic ground state. Extensive calculations have

been carried out for quasibound states in the entrance and exit channel van der Waals wells

9

to characterize the rich resonance structure observed in our scattering calculations. We found

that the resonances arise from the decay of metastable states of both H · · · F−Li and Li · · · F−

H van der Waals complexes. In particular, the quasibound states of the deep Li · · · F − H

van der Waals well were found to strongly imprint the resonance structure for reactions

involving LiF(v = 0, j = 0). For vibrationally excited reagents, however, resonances are

mainly originating from tunneling of metastable states of H · · · F − Li

into the HF(v′ = 0)

product manifold. Consistent with our recent ﬁndings for the reverse reaction [20], chemical

reactivity for H + LiF → HF + Li is enhanced by vibrational excitation of the reagents at

low and ultralow temperatures. In contrast to Li + HF(v = 1, j = 0), nonreactive processes

dominate over HF formation in H + LiF(v = 0 − 2, j = 0) collisions. However, quasibound

states of the entrance channel van der Waals potential do decay through vibrational pre-

reaction by tunneling of the ﬂuorine atom. The results suggest that heavy atom tunneling

at low temperatures may be more important than generally recognized, as observed recently

by Zuev et al. [3] for carbon tunneling in ring expansion reactions.

The noble-gas atom xenon can bind ﬂuorine atoms and form several stable compounds. We study
the electronic structure of the xenon ﬂuorides (XeFn, n = 2, 4, 6) by calculating their ionization
spectra using a Green’s function method, which allows to treat many-body eﬀects at a high level.
Our focus is on the valence region and on the Xe 4d core hole. We observe a sensitive dependence of
the spectra on the number of ﬂuorine ligands. Systematic line shifts are uncovered and explained.
In the Xe 5s and F 2s inner-valence regimes, from XeF2 to XeF6, the usefulness of the one-particle
picture of ionization is found to become progressively worse. Moreover, adding the electronegative
ﬂuorine ligands seems to enhance—not suppress—the Auger decay of a Xe 4d core hole.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Noble-gas atoms are, in general, chemically rather in-
ert. Nevertheless, since the heavy noble-gas species kryp-
ton, xenon, and radon possess a comparatively small ion-
ization potential, they can form molecules, at least to-
gether with electronegative elements. The most stable
and most widely investigated among these compounds
are the xenon ﬂuorides1 XeF2, XeF4, and XeF6.

The electronic structure of the xenon ﬂuorides has been
the subject of a number of both experimental and theo-
retical investigations. In the 1970’s, photoabsorption ex-
periments, at photon energies between 50 and 160 eV2,3
and between 6 and 35 eV4, were carried out at DESY in
Hamburg. Carroll et al.5 employed photoelectron spec-
troscopy to measure the chemical shifts of the F 1s and
Xe 3d levels in the xenon ﬂuorides. More recently, using
synchrotron radiation, Cutler et al.6 obtained gas-phase
photoelectron spectra with such a high resolution that
ﬂuorine-ligand ﬁeld splittings on the Xe 4d levels could
be extracted.

Photoelectron spectroscopy, in combination with ab
initio studies, is an outstanding tool for characterizing
the electronic structure of a molecule. However, at least
in the case of the xenon ﬂuorides, there exist—to our
knowledge—only few theoretical contributions to moti-
vate and back-up experimental work. The pioneering pa-
pers7–9, which are more than 20 years old, utilized self-
consistent-ﬁeld methods to calculate ionization poten-
tials. The restriction to an eﬀective one-particle model
made it impossible to uncover complexities due to elec-
tron correlation. Newer theoretical work10–12 on xenon
ﬂuorides focused on electronic ground-state geometries
and dissociation energies.
It is therefore timely to im-
prove on the early studies and to explore some of the
many-body physics of electrons in XeF2, XeF4, and XeF6.
This is the purpose of this paper.

We proceed as follows. Section II describes the Green’s
function method we use to calculate ionization spectra.
We discuss the molecular geometries we employed in our
calculations, and we analyze the impact of relativistic
eﬀects on the ionization spectra of the xenon ﬂuorides.
The ionization spectra we calculated cover the valence

regime and the Xe 4d core line; they are presented in
Sec. III. A detailed comparison between spectra that
take electron correlation into account and spectra based
on the Hartree-Fock model demonstrates the occurrence
of many-body phenomena in almost the entire spectral
regime we consider. These phenomena display an inter-
esting dependence on the number of ﬂuorine ligands. A
summary and conclusions are given in Sec. IV.

II. COMPUTATIONAL DETAILS

A. Algebraic Diagrammatic Construction

Green’s functions are a fundamental tool of many-body
theory13–16. They are well suited to calculating various
properties of molecules17,18. For instance, the pole po-
sitions of the one-particle propagator yield the vertical
ionization potentials of a molecule. The residuum or
pole strength of a pole of the one-particle propagator
is a measure of the one-particle character of a speciﬁc
ionized state, i.e. it is a measure how well the physical
state is described within the one-hole conﬁguration space
deriving from the Hartree-Fock ground state.

Algebraic diagrammatic construction (ADC)

is a
systematic approximation scheme for
sophisticated,
Green’s functions19–21. The n-th order ADC scheme,
ADC(n) for short, contains inﬁnite summations of those
classes of Feynman diagrams that derive from the ﬁrst n
orders of the Feynman-Dyson perturbation series. The
problem of ﬁnding the pole positions and pole strengths
of a Green’s function is formulated in terms of the solu-
tion of a Hermitian matrix eigenvalue problem.

The one-particle ADC(3) scheme we use in this work
to calculate ionization spectra employs the Dyson equa-
tion13,20, which allows to sum many diagram classes in
addition to the summation already carried out by the
ADC scheme itself. Exploiting the validity of the Dyson
equation necessitates the combined treatment of the ion-
ization potentials and the electron aﬃnities. The latter
are also given by pole positions of the one-particle prop-
agator. This approach enlarges the aforementioned ADC
eigenvalue problem considerably. Therefore, the aﬃnity

block in the ADC matrix is reduced in practice by per-
forming on this block a few (typically ten) block Lanc-
zos iterations22. The most important spectral features of
the aﬃnity block are preserved in this way, and the ﬁ-
nal eigenvalue problem to be solved becomes much more
manageable.

The ionization potentials associated with the Xe 4d or-
bitals in the xenon ﬂuorides lie far above the molecu-
lar double ionization threshold. Hence, not only two-
hole–one-particle conﬁgurations but also three-hole–two-
particle conﬁgurations are expected to have impact on
the description of the core-level ionization spectra23–25.
The ADC(3) scheme does not contain three-hole–two-
particle conﬁgurations explicitly, but the next-order
scheme, ADC(4), does. Thus, one expects that the
ADC(4) scheme yields an appreciable improvement of
calculated core-level ionization spectra.

The inclusion of three-hole–two-particle conﬁgurations
enlarges the conﬁguration space—and the associated
eigenvalue problem—extremely. The available computer
resources would not be suﬃcient to calculate ionization
spectra of molecules like XeF6 in an acceptable amount
of time. The existing ADC(4) programs24–26 therefore
utilize the core–valence separation approximation23 for
core-level ionization, which reduces the size of the con-
ﬁguration space. This approximation, however, makes
it impossible to calculate ionization potentials in the va-
lence regime. Furthermore, since core–valence separa-
tion implies that all elements of the conﬁguration space
carry a core hole, those two-hole–one-particle conﬁgura-
tions that are needed to describe core-hole decay are not
included. For these reasons, the ADC(4) programs are
useless for the questions we would like to address here.
Hence, all ionization spectra were calculated within the
ADC(3) scheme20,21.

B. Geometries and Basis Sets

The ground-state geometries of F2, XeF2, XeF4 and
XeF6 are taken from the literature. The distance of
the ﬂuorine atoms in the ﬂuorine molecule is r(F–
F) = 1.42 ˚A 1. Xenon(II)-ﬂuoride is a linear molecule
of D∞h symmetry with a Xe–F distance of 1.977 ˚A 1.
Xenon(IV)-ﬂuoride is square-planar (D4h), the Xe–F dis-
tance is 1.94 ˚A. All distances given refer to molecules in
the gas phase.

The ground-state geometry of xenon(VI)-ﬂuoride in
the gas phase is a distorted octahedron6,10.
It can be
described in C3v symmetry. Nevertheless, some of our
computations on XeF6 were performed in Oh symmetry
to elucidate the impact of the reduced symmetry. The no-
tation of Fig. 1a in Ref. 10 is used here. Our calculations
on XeF6 in C3v symmetry use the bond lengths r(Xe–
F1) = 1.856 ˚A and r(Xe–F4) = 1.972 ˚A and bond an-
gles α = 80.8◦ and β = 112.8◦. These values, which were
determined using MP2 and an all-electron basis with f
functions, were taken from Tables 2 and 3 in Ref. 10. Our

2

computations on XeF6 in Oh symmetry were performed
at the bond length r(Xe–F) = 1.952 ˚A, which is taken
from Table 1 in Ref. 10.

The ADC programs22,26 (see Sec. II A) require molecu-
lar integrals and orbital energies. These were obtained in
Hartree-Fock calculations using the Gamess-UK27 pro-
gram package. The employed software does not exploit
symmetry for the xenon atom. D2h symmetry is used
for F2, XeF2 and XeF4. The calculation of the ioniza-
tion potentials of XeF6 in the ground-state geometry of
C3v symmetry is performed in Cs symmetry; for the ge-
ometry of Oh symmetry, Gamess-UK assumes D2h sym-
metry. Comparing the orbital energies from both the C3v
and the Oh geometry shows that the overall positions of
the xenon-like orbitals are in good agreement in both
symmetries, but the splitting of the ﬂuorine-like orbitals
is enlarged due to the increased interaction in C3v sym-
metry28.

The xenon and the ﬂuorine atoms are represented by
the DZVP (DFT orbital)29,30 basis set. The quality of
the basis set can be estimated from Table I by comparing
the numerically exact Hartree-Fock orbital energies (see
the ensuing Sec. II C) of xenon with those obtained using
the DZVP (DFT orbital) basis set. The shift of the or-
bitals, due to the approximation introduced by the ﬁnite
basis set, is ∆εBS := εHF, numeric − εHF, DZVP. The shift
is ≈ 0.13 eV for the Xe 4d orbitals and even less for the
valence orbitals because basis sets are usually optimized
with respect to the latter orbitals. This shift is neglected
in the following, for other sources of inaccuracies are more
signiﬁcant.

C. Relativistic Eﬀects

There are three main relativistic eﬀects one has to
take into account when examining heavy atoms like
xenon31,32:

1. the relativistic radial contraction and energetic sta-

bilization of the s and p shells,

2. the spin-orbit splitting,

3. the relativistic radial expansion and the energetic

destabilization of the (outer) d and f shells.

Eﬀects (1) and (3) are termed scalar relativistic eﬀects10.
As the theory of Sec. II A for the calculation of ion-
ization potentials is strictly non-relativistic, one has to
take into account relativistic eﬀects by a “rule of thumb”.
This is done by performing for the xenon atom Hartree-
Fock calculations with mchf8433 and Dirac-Fock calcu-
lations, the relativistic counterpart to Hartree-Fock31,32,
with grasp9234,35. Due to the spherical symmetry of
atoms, the equations can be solved without ﬁxed basis
sets to arbitrary precision. This gives exact sets of rel-
ativistic and non-relativistic orbitals in the mean-ﬁeld
approximation.

In Table I, the orbital energies determined in this way
are listed together with Hartree-Fock orbital energies ob-
tained by a calculation employing the DZVP (DFT Or-
bital) basis set. By comparing the orbital energies of the
two numerical solutions of the Hartree-Fock and Dirac-
Fock equations, one can determine the size of relativistic
eﬀects and correct for them in non-relativistic computa-
tions of the ionization potentials of the xenon ﬂuorides.
In order to carry out this comparison, one has to note
that the total angular momentum j results from cou-
pling the orbital angular momentum l with the electron
spin: j = l± 1
2 . A Dirac-Fock calculation yields, for l ≥ 1,
2 and one for j− = l − 1
two orbitals31, one for j+ = l + 1
2 .
The j− orbital has a lower orbital energy than the j+ or-
bital.

The spin-orbit splitting between the j+ orbital and the
j− orbital can be eﬀectively removed by calculating a
weighted mean

¯εDF =

(2j+ + 1) εDF,+ + (2j− + 1) εDF,−
2j+ + 1 + 2j− + 1

(1)

of the two Dirac-Fock orbital energies31. This procedure
facilitates comparison between the Dirac-Fock and the
Hartree-Fock calculation. The scalar relativistic shift of
the non-relativistic orbitals is ∆ε := ¯εDF − εHF. The
shifts are 3.077 eV for the Xe 4d, −1.789 eV for the Xe 5s
and −0.00283 eV for the Xe 5p orbitals. The sign of the
shift ∆ε is predicted by the rules (1) and (3) given above,
because the energetic stabilization of s and p orbitals
leads to a lowering of the Xe 5s and Xe 5p orbital ener-
gies and thus ∆ε < 0. Similarly, ∆ε > 0 holds for the
shift of the Xe 4d orbital energies due to the energetic
destabilization of the (outer) d orbitals.

Koopmans’ theorem16,36 states that the ionization po-
tentials of an atom or a molecule are approximately given
by the negative of the orbital energies, IP ≈ −εHF.
As the relativistic shift ∆ε represents a relativistic cor-
rection to the Hartree-Fock orbital energies εHF,corr =
εHF + ∆ε, the ionization potentials are corrected as fol-
lows: IPcorr = IPHF − ∆ε.

The mentioned shifts of the orbital energies of the
xenon atom are used to correct the Xe 4d orbital ener-
gies for the scalar relativistic eﬀect by adding −∆ε to
the Xe 4d ionization potential of the non-relativistic cal-
culations. This procedure is justiﬁed by the observation
that the molecular Xe 4d orbitals are highly localized and
are very similar to atomic Xe 4d orbitals. The Xe 4d ion-
ization potentials, calculated with the ADC(3) scheme,
take electron correlation into account. Therefore, con-
tributions of many orbitals mix into the description of
the Xe 4d ionized states. Since the Xe 4d ionized states
are predominantly described by the Xe 4d orbitals, the
relativistic correction is applicable in this case as well.

The spin-orbit splitting in the xenon atom amounts
to 2.111 eV for the 4d orbitals and 1.436 eV for 5p orbitals
(see Table I). The spin-orbit splitting in the xenon atom
is probably only a good approximation6 for the Xe 4d or-
bitals in the xenon ﬂuorides, because the Xe 5p orbitals

3

suﬀer from a signiﬁcant modiﬁcation by the molecular
bond to the ﬂuorine atoms. The experimental value for
the spin-orbit splitting of the 4d orbitals in the xenon
atom is 1.984 ± 0.014 eV6 (see Table IV). The theoreti-
cally and experimentally determined values are in satis-
factory agreement. A good agreement is not expected be-
cause the Dirac-Fock equations are based on a mean-ﬁeld
approximation31. Spin-orbit splitting is not accounted
for in the non-relativistic theory used throughout and is
not considered any further in the ensuing sections.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

A. Mean-Field Model

Single ionization spectra of the xenon ﬂuorides can
be obtained in the Hartree-Fock approximation with
the help of Koopmans’ theorem16,36. In this mean-ﬁeld
model, the correlation between the electrons is neglected,
resulting in very simple spectra (see Fig. 1) that can
provide hints for the interpretation of the more com-
plex spectra that include electron correlation (see Fig. 2).
The assignment of the lines in Fig. 1 to atomic orbitals
of xenon or ﬂuorine is not strict in the valence region,
due to the molecular bond. In the deeper lying molecu-
lar orbitals, this assignment is well deﬁned. Since spin-
orbit coupling is neglected, artiﬁcial degeneracies are in-
troduced in the spectra of Fig. 1. The eﬀect of the ligand
ﬁeld caused by the ﬂuorine atoms is of course included.
The eﬀect of adding ﬂuorine atoms to xenon is stud-
ied in Table II by Mulliken and L¨owdin population anal-
yses16,37. Such population analyses may exhibit some
basis set dependence16, but the consistency between the
two sets of results indicates reliability. One sees imme-
diately that charge is withdrawn from the xenon atom
to the ﬂuorine atoms: 1.1 electron charges in XeF2, 1.9
in XeF4, and 2.3 in XeF6. Due to the C3v symmetry of
the ground-state geometry of XeF6, there are two kinds
of ﬂuorine atoms, with diﬀerent distances to the central
xenon atom. These diﬀerences in nuclear separation are
reﬂected in Table II by the fact that ﬂuorine atoms which
are further away from the xenon atom acquire less charge.
At ﬁrst sight one might assume that the computed
change in charge density involves only the valence elec-
trons and has little eﬀect on the inner molecular orbitals
of the xenon ﬂuorides. In the hydrogen atom, the wave
functions of the higher lying shells, which are unoccu-
pied in the ground state, have a considerable amplitude
in the spatial regions of the lower lying shells of the same
angular momentum38. As this argument also holds in
the case of the xenon ﬂuorides, a reduction of valence
electron density on the xenon atom leads to a less eﬃ-
cient screening of its nuclear charge and consequently to
a lowering in energy of the energetically low lying molec-
ular orbitals with a dominant contribution on the xenon
atom.

Conversely, the increase of valence electron density on

due to the molecular bond.

the ﬂuorine atoms leads to a more eﬃcient screening of
their nuclear charge and consequently raises the energy of
the lower lying molecular orbitals with a dominant con-
tribution on ﬂuorine atoms. The charge withdrawn from
the xenon atom is shared among several ﬂuorine atoms.
The net increase of charge density on each ﬂuorine atom

is ≈ 0.5 electron charges. This value is, of course, much
smaller than the loss of charge density on the xenon atom
and hence the impact on the inner molecular orbitals of
ﬂuorine character is clearly much smaller than for xenon.
It is most dramatic in XeF2 where each ﬂuorine atom ac-
quires the largest fraction of charge. The screening of the

nuclear charge is largest in XeF2 and decreases in XeF4
and XeF6.

The eﬀects of this model can be seen in Fig. 1. The
positions of the Xe 5s and Xe 4d lines shift to higher bind-
ing energies with an increasing number of ﬂuorine atoms.
The energy diﬀerences between the corresponding lines
of XeF2 and XeF4 and of XeF4 and XeF6 are nearly
equally large. The F 2p and F 2s lines also shift slightly
to higher binding energies with increasing number of ﬂu-
orine atoms. The charge redistribution over several ﬂu-
orine ligands we mentioned earlier furnishes an explana-
tion for the shift of the ﬂuorine lines. This interpretation
is further supported by a comparison with F2. The mean
of the F 2p lines in F2 and the mean of the F 2s lines in F2
are higher in energy than the mean values of the corre-
sponding lines in XeF2. The ﬁrst ionization potential is
nearly constant for all xenon ﬂuorides studied. Its value
is ≈ 12.5 eV.

In the ﬂuorine molecule, the two F 2s lines are split
considerably due to the molecular bond. The splitting
of the two F 2s lines in XeF2 is tiny due to the large
separation of the ﬂuorine atoms. In XeF4 and XeF6, the
ﬂuorine atoms are closer and interact. This results in
a larger splitting of the F 2s lines in comparison to the
splitting in XeF2.

The Xe 4d lines are quintuply degenerate in the single
ionization spectrum of the xenon atom in Fig. 1. In XeF2,
the degeneracy is lifted by the ligand ﬁeld of the ﬂuo-
rine atoms and three distinct lines become visible. The
three lines reﬂect the spatial orientation of the 4d or-
bitals. There is a ligand ﬁeld along the molecular axis.
Perpendicular to the molecular axis there is no shift, re-
sulting in a total of three lines.
In XeF4 there is only
one dimension left that is unaﬀected by the ligand ﬁeld:
the axis perpendicular to the molecular plane. The spec-
trum, Fig. 1, shows that there are two distinct groups of
Xe 4d lines in this case.

In XeF6, the situation changes because the ﬂuorine lig-
ands are grouped around the xenon atom in such a way
that XeF6 is close to octahedral symmetry. Oh symme-
try in XeF6 leads to two distinct Xe 4d orbital energies
separated by only 0.1568 eV. Lowering the symmetry of
XeF6 to C3v results in three distinct Xe 4d orbital ener-

compared to the much larger Xe 4d splittings in XeF2 and
XeF4.

B. Correlation Eﬀects

Going beyond the Hartree-Fock description of the
molecules by using ADC(3) leads to the ionization poten-
tials plotted in Fig. 2. Figure 1 helps identify the one-
particle origin of the states in Fig. 2. The Xe 4d lines
are energetically clearly separated from the outer and
inner valence lines in all spectra. They are located be-
tween 72 eV and 82 eV. The F 2s-derived lines are present
between 35 eV and 45 eV. Correlation eﬀects do not
change the fact that the lowest ionization potentials are
approximately equal in all compounds.

In fact, at the lowest ionization potentials, which are
associated with the Xe 5p levels, there is qualitative
agreement between the correlated and the mean-ﬁeld cal-
culation: The pole strengths are very close to unity;
the one-particle picture is valid. Nevertheless, ADC(3)
improves on the Hartree-Fock method in a quantitative
manner. In the correlated calculation, the energetically
lowest cations are stabilized by about 1 eV relative to the
respective one-particle energies. The ﬁrst ionization po-
tentials of xenon and its ﬂuorides, as calculated within
the ADC(3) scheme, are compared to the experimental
results in Table III. The agreement of experimental and
calculated ionization potentials is good.

At higher energies, there is typically not even qualita-
tive agreement between mean-ﬁeld and many-body treat-
ment. Overall, there is a dramatic change of the ioniza-
tion spectra due to the inclusion of many-body eﬀects.
The importance of electron correlation grows with in-
creasing number of ﬂuorine atoms. This is reﬂected in
energy shifts and reduction of intensity in the outer va-
lence part of the spectra; in the appearance of numerous
satellite lines in the vicinity of 20 eV and above; and, in
particular, in the eye-catching breakdown of the molec-
ular orbital picture of ionization seen in the Xe 5s and
F 2s inner-valence region.

The latter phenomenon is common in molecules39: The
intensity originally conﬁned to a single orbital in Fig. 1
is spread over many cationic states (see Fig. 2). The

FIG. 2: (Color) Single ionization spectra of Xe, F2, XeF2, XeF4, and XeF6 calculated with the one-particle ADC(3) program
(see the text). The assignment of lines to atomic orbitals of xenon or ﬂuorine origin is not done for the XeFn molecules.

breakdown of the molecular orbital picture of ioniza-
tion is caused by compact two-hole–one-particle conﬁg-
urations that are close in energy to a one-hole state39.
The strong Coulomb coupling of these conﬁgurations to
one-hole states leads to a broad shape of lines, which
has been discovered in the inner-valence region of many
molecules39.

the breakdown of the molecular orbital picture of ioniza-
tion has to be separated clearly from the decaying states
in a small energy range where each decaying state is rep-
resented by a discretized Lorentzian curve. Furthermore,
there can be a mixing of both phenomena for a certain
state, but it is hard to identify a decay curve for one-hole
states that suﬀer from the breakdown phenomenon.

Due to the many-body description of a molecule by the
ADC scheme, decay processes of electronic states of the
ion that lie above the double ionization threshold also
become describable40.
In particular, the ﬁnal state of
the electronic decay of an ionized molecule can be ap-
proximated in terms of two-hole–one-particle conﬁgura-
tions describing the emitted electron (the particle) and
the residual dication (the two holes)41. The shape of each
decaying state can be identiﬁed as a thin bundle of lines,
which mimic a discretized Lorentzian curve40.

In order to unambiguously identify a decaying state,

The inner-valence region of the xenon ﬂuorides com-
prises the Xe 5s and F 2s states. The F 2s states are sub-
ject to the breakdown phenomenon and can also decay
by emitting an electron28,42. The Xe 5s one-hole state
suﬀers solely from breakdown. No decay is possible be-
cause its ionization potential is below the double ioniza-
tion threshold28,42. Many two-hole–one-particle conﬁgu-
rations can couple to the Xe 5s one-hole state (see Fig. 2).
As the Xe 5s line is close to the double ionization thresh-
old28,42, many two-hole–one-particle conﬁgurations are
close in energy to this state: The excited states are gen-

erally very dense in this energetic region.

The spectra exhibit a considerable increase of break-
down of the molecular orbital picture for the inner va-
lence with an increasing number of ﬂuorine atoms. Ob-
viously, the number of suitable conﬁgurations rises due to
the addition of ﬂuorine atoms. Since xenon ﬂuorides are
very symmetric, these ﬂuorine atoms are all equivalent
(except for XeF6 in C3v symmetry), and the number of
equivalent two-hole–one-particle conﬁgurations with one
hole on the xenon atom and one hole on a ﬂuorine atom
doubles between XeF2 and XeF4. In XeF6 there are even
more such conﬁgurations than there are in XeF4, but
they are no longer equivalent due to the C3v symmetry
of the XeF6 ground state.

Another contribution to the increase of one-hole states
involved in the breakdown phenomenon can be attributed
to the decrease in symmetry: spherical symmetry (Xe),
D∞h (XeF2), D4h (XeF4), C3v (XeF6). This decrease
in symmetry leads to an increase in excited electronic
conﬁgurations that can couple to the respective one-hole
states.

The one-particle picture provides a rather good de-
scription for the Xe 4d lines. Two-hole–one-particle con-
ﬁgurations close to the energy of the core one-hole conﬁg-
urations are spatially diﬀuse and thus couple only weakly
to the core one-hole conﬁgurations. Therefore, in the
core regime, the mixing of two-hole–one-particle conﬁg-
urations with one-hole conﬁgurations is relatively weak.
The splittings of the Xe 4d lines in the xenon ﬂuorides are
of comparable size to those in Fig. 1, and the individual
lines can be identiﬁed easily in all molecules but XeF6.

Since in all xenon ﬂuorides the Xe 4d lines are above
the double ionization threshold28,42, Xe 4d-ionized xenon
ﬂuorides can undergo Auger decay. The Xe 4d lines in
Fig. 2 show signs of decay by exhibiting features of dis-
cretized Lorentzian curves. The shape of the approxi-
mate Lorentzian curve representing a decaying state in
the spectra depends highly on the number of two-hole–
one-particle conﬁgurations in the energy range of the de-
cay electron.

The decay electrons that result from the decay of a
Xe 4d vacancy are highly energetic (up to ≈ 60 eV).
Hence, a satisfactory description in terms of Gaussian
basis sets is not feasible. For this reason, the Xe 4d ion-
ization potentials in Fig. 2 correspond in our description
essentially to one-hole states (a pole strength close to
unity). Nevertheless, the number of states which orig-
inate from two-hole–one-particle conﬁgurations around
the Xe 4d ionization potentials grows substantially with
the number of ﬂuorine atoms. In XeF6 one observes very
densely lying states around 83 eV with a high contri-
bution of two-hole–one-particle conﬁgurations. The ex-
treme change in the importance of two-hole–one-particle
conﬁgurations in XeF6 compared to XeF4, XeF2 was in-
vestigated by us.

The six ﬂuorine atoms in XeF6 form a distorted oc-
tahedron around the xenon atom. The basis set of the
ﬂuorine atoms may therefore help improve the descrip-

7

tion of the decay electron from Xe 4d-ionized XeF6 con-
siderably. To test this assumption, we calculated the ion-
ization spectrum of XeF2 with the DZVP (DFT orbital)
basis set augmented by a few diﬀuse functions. The re-
sulting spectrum did not change much compared to that
of Fig. 2.

To test the eﬀect of the basis functions on the ﬂuorine
atoms, we performed another calculation of the ionization
spectrum of XeF2 with ﬂuorine basis functions attached
to ghost centers arranged such as to yield an octahedron
of ﬂuorine basis functions surrounding the central xenon
atom. The extra basis functions had a minor eﬀect on
the spectrum and did not account for the drastic eﬀect
observed in Fig. 2 for XeF6.

These investigations convinced us of the suitability
of the DZVP (DFT orbital) basis set for our concerns
but did not clarify the reasons for the drastic change in
Fig. 2. To this end, we calculated the ionization spec-
trum of XeF6 in Oh geometry. The resulting Xe 4d lines
had a shape similar to that of the Xe 4d lines in XeF4,
revealing the great importance of the decreased symme-
try for the description of XeF6 in our computations. The
reduction in symmetry from Oh to C3v enables a vastly
enlarged amount of two-hole–one-particle conﬁgurations
to couple to the Xe 4d one-hole conﬁgurations. To some
extent, this is similar to an increased basis set, as a mul-
titude of conﬁgurations are provided additionally for the
description of the ionized states. For sure, this improves
the description of those decay electrons with low kinetic
energy.

The charge transfer from the xenon atom to the ﬂuo-
rine atoms in the ground state, discussed in Sec. III A,
leaves a positively charged central xenon atom. There-
fore, it is not surprising that XeF4 and XeF6 possess
positive electron aﬃnities, i.e. (XeF4)− and (XeF6)− are
electronically stable anions. We have computed the re-
spective electron aﬃnities by ADC(3). The value ob-
tained for XeF4 (a doubly degenerate state) is 0.66 eV;
the electron aﬃnities of XeF6 lie at 1.30 eV, 1.31 eV, and
1.81 eV, respectively. The ﬁgures are presumably not
very accurate because the DZVP (DFT orbital) basis set
is not particularly well suited for describing the diﬀuse
states of anions.
In XeF6, the ﬂuorine atoms form a
cage of negative charge, of nearly octahedral symmetry,
surrounding the central, positively charged xenon atom.
The resulting potential well is similar to the model po-
tential well discussed in Refs. 28,43. In these references,
both bound states as well as scattering resonances in the
model potential well were investigated.

The Xe 4d and F 2s lines in Fig. 2 are shifted to
higher ionization potentials with increasing number of
ﬂuorine atoms (see Sec. III A). This general trend, seen
in the mean-ﬁeld approximation of Fig. 1, can still be
identiﬁed if electron correlation is taken into account.
Nevertheless, the diﬀerence between the shifts of the
Xe 4d lines of XeF2 and XeF4 is larger than that be-
tween the Xe 4d lines of XeF4 and XeF6. Electron cor-
relation reduces the eﬀect caused by charge depletion on

the xenon atom.

The non-relativistic IPADC are listed in Table IV to-
gether with the IPrel obtained by applying to IPADC the
relativistic correction −∆ε of Sec. II C. The number of
distinct Xe 4d lines is smaller in the non-relativistic spec-
tra due to a higher degeneracy caused by neglecting the
spin-orbit coupling. The Xe 4d lines of XeF6 cannot be
identiﬁed clearly in Fig. 2. One expects from Sec. III A
two lines for a ground-state geometry of Oh symmetry
and three lines for a ground-state geometry of C3v sym-
metry. The two ionization potentials, in the energy range
of the Xe 4d lines of XeF6 (80–83 eV), with maximum
pole strength are listed in Table IV.

The Xe 4d IPrel diﬀer from the experimentally obtained
data in Table IV by only 1.5–2.5 eV (≈ 3%), which is a
good agreement in view of the complexity of the problem
and the necessity to describe the decay simultaneously.
The reason for the deviation is twofold. First, the spin-
orbit splitting is neglected, which amounts to 2.111 eV
for the Xe 4d lines of the xenon atom, according to
Sec. II C. Second, since the calculations are based on the

8

ADC(3) approximation, the three-hole–two-particle con-
ﬁgurations are neglected (ADC(4) calculations are cur-
rently beyond reach). The inclusion of these additional
conﬁgurations would shift the ionization potentials of the
Xe 4d lines further to lower energy, due to an improved
description of core-hole relaxation24.

Let us now turn our attention to the last column in
Table IV: the experimental widths of the Xe 4d photo-
electron peaks6. It is evident that, on average, the widths
increase from Xe to XeF6. According to Cutler et al.6,
this eﬀect probably cannot be explained in terms of vi-
If the data reﬂect more or less
brational broadening.
pure Auger widths, then the experimental ﬁndings are
in contradiction to expectations based on the one-center
model44. The electronegative ﬂuorine ligands withdraw
charge from xenon (see Table II). Correspondingly, fewer
valence electrons are available for a local, atomic mech-
anism of Xe 4d Auger decay. Hartmann’s semiempirical
multi-center model45, on the other hand, predicts a larger
C 1s Auger width for CF4 than for CH4, which, though
seemingly in line with the trend in XeFn, is inconsistent
with experiment46.

In our work on neon clusters, we demonstrated not
only that a Ne 2s hole in a cluster can decay by electron
emission47—a fact conﬁrmed by a recent experiment48—
but also that the decay lifetime depends sensitively on the
number of nearest neighbors surrounding the atom carry-
ing the inner-valence hole41. The Ne 2s lifetime drops in
a monotonic manner from about 80 fs in Ne+
2 to less than
5 fs in Ne+
13. The mechanism responsible for this dramatic
eﬀect is referred to as Interatomic Coulombic Decay. In
heteroclusters, additional electronic mechanisms play a
role49. We will demonstrate in an upcoming paper42 how
the decay mechanisms discovered in clusters elucidate the
counterintuitive behavior of the Xe 4d Auger widths in
XeFn.

Here, we would like to emphasize that traces of a purely
electronic origin can already be found in our ADC(3)
spectra, Fig. 2. As the number of ﬂuorine ligands grows,
there are more and more two-hole–one-particle conﬁgura-
tions that can couple to the Xe 4d holes. In other words,
the number of dicationic decay channels grows, and there-
fore we observe in Fig. 2 an increasing loss of main-line
intensity and the emergence of dense line bundles. This
is the signature in our ﬁnite-basis-set calculations of en-
hanced electronic decay40, as pointed out previously.

IV. CONCLUSION

The xenon ﬂuorides are very special systems. Not only
are they rather peculiar chemical compounds, they are
also particularly well suited to investigating the system-
atic evolution of many-body eﬀects.

While outer-valence ionization is mostly compatible
with the mean-ﬁeld approach, the situation is strikingly
diﬀerent in the inner-valence region. At the Hartree-Fock
level, the chemical environment leads to mere shifts of the

Xe 5s and F 2s lines. The ADC(3) calculation, however,
reveals that electron correlation can induce additional,
pronounced environmental eﬀects. Xe 5s ionization in
XeF2 can be relatively well understood in terms of a one-
particle picture. In XeF4, this picture begins to crumble,
and in XeF6, there is not a single cationic eigenstate that
overlaps well with the Xe 5s one-hole conﬁguration.

The F 2s states are even more interesting, since they
are higher in energy than the double ionization thresh-
old. In the xenon ﬂuorides, electron correlation enforces
the excitation of a large, system-dependent number of
F 2s-derived electronic states. All of these states are res-
onances decaying by electron emission. Neither the decay
mechanism nor the decay timescale are known. Resolving
these issues may have important consequences for other
molecules. This poses an exciting challenge to both the-
ory and experiment.

This is the ﬁrst paper dealing with the inner-valence
physics of XeFn at a correlated level. We are not aware
of any experimental spectra in this energy region. The
quality of our calculations can be assessed, however, by
reference to our ADC(3) results for the Xe 4d core lines.
Upon correction for scalar relativistic eﬀects, our numeri-
cal data agree with experiment within a few percent. The

9

remaining diﬀerence can be attributed to an incomplete
description of core-hole relaxation and to our neglect of
spin-orbit coupling. The ADC(3) scheme is capable of
reproducing the experimentally observed line shifts as
well as the counterintuitive Auger broadening. A detailed
analysis of the latter phenomenon will be presented else-
where.

I.

INTRODUCTION

In the last decade Surface Enhanced Raman Scatter-
ing (SERS)[1] has made rapid progress towards applica-
tions. With a sensitivity rivalling ﬂuorescence in some
cases, and a much higher structural speciﬁcity, SERS is
a highly attractive technique, being developed simulta-
neously with the ﬁeld of plasmonics. Progress towards
diﬀerent uses of SERS in practical applications has been
steady. New substrates including: arrays of inverted
pyramids[2], silver pillar and torroid arrays[3], adap-
tive silver ﬁlms[4], and metallic nano-shells[5], have been
demonstrated. In addition, many molecules relevant to
a myriad of applications such as glucose[6], proteins[7],
DNA[8], a wide range of medicinal drugs[9, 10, 11], and
substances for forensic science[12], have been character-
ized. On the other hand, the understanding of some fun-
damental aspects of the phenomenon has been slow, and
in some cases controversial. Although a full understand-
ing is sometimes not essential for the development of ap-
plications, there can be no denying in the fact that a full
comprehension is desirable.

Optical pumping of vibrational modes was ﬁrst sug-
gested in 1996 based on the observed dependence of
the anti-Stokes/Stokes (aS/S) ratio with incident laser
power[13], and it was suggested that this could be a
possible tool to estimate SERS cross sections. However,
the interpretation of the experimental results have been
the subject of considerable debate in the literature, with
many authors simply denying its existence and attribut-
ing the experimental observations to either laser-heating,
resonance eﬀects, or combinations thereof[14, 15, 16, 17].

Over a series of previous papers we have suggested the
investigation of the aS/S-ratio as a function of tempera-
ture (T ) as an alternative method for the observation of
pumping[18, 19, 20]. In a recent paper, we provided what
we believe is a deﬁnitive proof for vibrational pumping
under SERS conditions using this technique[20]. Accord-
ingly, we provide here an in-depth discussion on the state
of the state-of-the-art of cross section estimation in SERS
via vibrational pumping, and extend the method to dif-
ferent analytes, and laser excitations. We also address
several outstanding issues which were not considered
previously[20]. Before we go into the details, we brieﬂy
review the necessary concepts for understanding aS/S-
ratios and vibrational pumping in SERS. The method
we are going to discuss has not been used much by other
authors and, therefore, we review not only the historical
background that led to this method, but also its peculiar-
ities and limitations to set the ground for future devel-
opments. The discussion has some natural overlap with
our previous papers[18, 19, 20] but it is presented here for
the sake of completeness, the convenience of the reader,
and future reference for forthcoming work in progress.
This will inevitably result in a somewhat lengthy intro-
ductory section where the principles of the method are
laid down. The next sections are fully devoted to this
and are followed by a section at the end with a prac-
tical experimental demonstration of SERS cross section
determination for several standard probes.

II. A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF SERS
PUMPING

A. The Anti-Stokes/Stokes ratio

∗Electronic address: Robert.Maher@imperial.ac.uk
†Electronic address: Pablo.Etchegoin@vuw.ac.nz

Let us consider the diﬀerent contributions to the popu-
lation of a single vibrational level at temperature T dur-

ing a SERS measurement; we can identify two main con-
tributions: (i) the laser itself which pumps vibrations
through Raman processes with a rate proportional to
its intensity (IL) and to the Raman-Stokes cross section
(σS), and (ii) thermal excitation and relaxation. Vibra-
tions remain in the level with a ﬁnite lifetime τ , which
encompasses all possible relaxation mechanisms –such as
intramolecular vibrational relaxation IVR (anharmonic
processes) or external relaxation mechanisms. There are
other possible secondary mechanisms, such as relaxation
through an anti-Stokes Raman processes, or excitation
to higher vibrational levels. It is possible to write rate
equations for the detailed dynamics of vibration popula-
tions in such a system [16]. In the regime of weak pump-
ing (which is the only case considered here), where the
vibrational population remains small, n ≪ 1, it is suﬃ-
cient to consider only the two main mechanisms, and the
rate equation for n can then be written as:

dn
dt

=

σSIL
¯hωL

+

exp(−¯hων/kBT )
τ

−

n
τ

,

(1)

where σS is the Raman-Stokes cross section, IL the in-
tensity (power per surface area) of the laser, ¯hωL the
energy of an exciting photon (nL = IL/¯hωL is the num-
ber of incident photon per unit time and surface area),
and ¯hων the energy of the vibration. The ﬁrst term on
the right is the number of vibrations per unit time being
pumped into the level by the action of the laser, while the
second and third terms are the contributions of thermal
excitation and population relaxation, respectively. In the
steady state dn/dt = 0. Generally, σS is very small, so
when IL is small the pumping contribution is negligible
and the vibrational population is dominated by thermal
eﬀects; i.e. n = exp(−¯hωv/kBT ) is given by a Bolztmann
factor. When IL is increased (so that there is a signiﬁ-
cant pumping contribution to the population of the level)
n becomes:

n =

τ σSIL
¯hωL

+ e−¯hων /kB T ,

(2)

where the pumping term is clearly distinguished from the
thermal contribution.

In addition,

for an ensemble of N molecules, the
Stokes-Raman signal is given by IS = N σSIL while the
anti-Stokes signal is given by IaS = nN σaSIL, leading
to:

IaS =

τ σS IL
¯hωL

(cid:18)

+ e−¯hων /kB T

N σaSIL.

(cid:19)

Moreover, taking the ratio of the anti-Stokes to the
Stokes intensities (ρ), we have:

ρ =

IS

=

σS

n = An,

diﬀerence between anti-Stokes and Stokes cross sections
arising from resonance eﬀects (due either to plasmon res-
onances or to resonant Raman scattering for a resonant
analyte), but also the standard wavelength dependence
of Raman processes Aων = (ωL + ων)4/(ωL − ων)4. ρ can
be be expressed as:

ρ = A

τ σSIL
¯hωL

(cid:20)

+ e−¯hων /kB T

.

(cid:21)

(5)

This simple model shows that the Stokes-Raman sig-
nal always remains linearly dependent on IL. The anti-
Stokes signal also shows a linear dependence with power
when pumping is negligible. But when pumping domi-
nates over thermal eﬀects, then IaS varies quadratically
with power while the aS/S-ratio is linearly dependent on
IL.

The original work by Kneipp et.

al.[13] used rho-
damine 6G (RH6G) and crystal violet (CV) (two com-
monly used SERS active dyes) under 830 nm excitation
at room temperature (RT). The argument for pumping
was primarily based on two observations: (i) the aS/S-
ratios were shown to be larger than expected for a Boltz-
mann factor, and (ii) the power dependence of the signal
at RT (where the thermal contribution is likely to dom-
inate, or be important) was quadratic. This observa-
tion of a non-linear dependence of the anti-Stokes inten-
sities with power (resulting in a linear dependence in the
aS/S-ratio) was thought to provide strong evidence for
vibrational pumping in SERS. Further measurements on
a DNA-base and carbon nanotubes[17] supported these
initial results. The arguments against this original inter-
pretation are summarized in the next subsection.

B. Resonance and heating eﬀects

Haslett et. al.[15] were the ﬁrst to seriously question
the existence of vibrational pumping as revealed in the
original studies. Extensive measurements were made un-
der similar conditions with a number of both resonant
and non-resonant molecules. They observed an anoma-
lous ratio for all the tested resonant molecules which was
independent of power until photo-bleaching occurred. No
anomaly was observed in the case of the non-resonant
molecules.
It was concluded that the anomalous ra-
tios observed in the original papers were the result of
“hidden” resonances rather than pumping[21]. Brolo et.
al.[14] also concluded that the observed anomalous ratio
could be explained by resonances. These resonances are
accounted for by the asymmetry factor A in the model
of the previous section. In the absence of pumping, the
aS/S-ratio is predicted to be:

ρ = A exp

−

¯hων
kBT (cid:19)

.

(cid:18)

(6)

where A is the asymmetry factor (extensively discussed
[18, 19, 20]). A includes not only any possible
in Refs.

It is clear that the A factor can indeed result in anoma-
lous ratios (diﬀerent from the Boltzmann factor), even in
the absence of pumping.

Furthermore, it was suggested that the observed power
dependence was not the eﬀect of pumping but rather laser
heating. The eﬀect of heating on ρ in the absence of
pumping can be simply understood by including it in
Eq. (6). The real temperature of the probed molecule,
Th, may be diﬀerent to the nominal temperature T be-
cause of heating eﬀects, either in the SERS substrate or
in the molecule itself [16]. By writing Th = T + ∆T and
assuming that ∆T ≪ T we can obtain the corresponding
ratio, ρh, by expanding Eq. 6 as:

ρh = A exp

−¯hων
kBT (cid:19)

(cid:18)

exp

¯hων
kBT

∆T
T (cid:19)

.

(cid:18)

(7)

This expression ﬁrst shows that heating can also result in
an anomalous aS/S ratio, even when A ≈ 1. Moreover, it
can have an important impact on the power dependence
of ρ, because ∆T should increase with IL. We can as-
sume in a ﬁrst approximation that ∆T ≈ αIL, since heat
diﬀusion and transfer are linear problems. The above ex-
pression shows that laser heating should then result in
an exponential increase of ρh with IL. However, in many
cases of interest, the argument in the second exponential
is small compared to 1, and Eq. (7) can then be further
expanded to give:

ρh = A exp

−¯hων
kBT (cid:19) (cid:18)

(cid:18)

1 +

¯hων
kBT

a
T

.

IL(cid:19)

(8)

A linear dependence of ρ with IL (or equivalently a
quadratic dependence of IaS with IL) can then equally
be the result of conventional heating eﬀects or pumping.
Such an observation is therefore insuﬃcient to demon-
strate the presence or not of vibrational pumping. We
also note that heating eﬀects can also explain the mode-
dependent behavior observed in the original work, as the
argument of the second exponential in Eq. (7) depends
on the mode energy ¯hων.

C. Temperature dependence of the aS/S ratios

Most studies have concentrated on ﬁnding evidence for
SERS pumping at room temperature (RT), in particu-
lar by studying the power dependence of the aS/S ratio.
It is true that the huge enhancements in SERS condi-
tions greatly increases the contribution from pumping,
but may also contribute to an increased heating (in par-
ticular directly in the probe molecules). At room tem-
perature (RT) and above, the thermal contribution to
ρ is relatively large and in many cases dominates, such
that ρ ≈ A exp(−¯hων/kBT ). The study of vibrational
pumping at RT therefore involves measuring small de-
partures from an already existing (large) thermal popu-
lation. Moreover, as the previous discussion has shown
it is also extremely diﬃcult to distinguish the relative
contributions or pumping and heating at RT.

A more practical approach is to study the temperature
dependence of the aS/S ratios, and in particular the low-
temperature regime where thermal eﬀects are expected

3

to be completely negligible compared to any other mech-
anisms, and in particular pumping. The temperature
dependence can be directly studied using the model pre-
sented so far. Figure 1 summarizes the diﬀerent scenarios
for aS/S-ratios as a function of temperature. The solid
lines show the variation of the ratio with T when pump-
ing is absent; i.e. an exponential decrease as T decreases,
following the Boltzmann factor exp(−¯hωv/kBT ). The
dashed lines show the case when pumping is present. At
high T ’s the ratio is approximately the same as if pump-
ing were absent. This is the thermally-dominated regime.
As T is decreased, there is a cross-over to a pumping-
dominated regime, where the ratio reaches a plateau. We
refer to the cross-over temperature between these two
regimes as Tcr; indicated by arrows in Fig. 1. The cross-
over occurs when pumping and thermal terms in Eq. (5)
are comparable, which occurs for:

kBTcr ≈ ¯hων (cid:20)

ln

(cid:18)

−1

¯hωL
τ σSIL (cid:19)(cid:21)

(9)

The cross-over occurs at a larger temperature for higher
powers IL, for which pumping is stronger, but also for
higher energy peaks (with a larger ¯hων), for which ther-
mal excitation is weaker.

In the pumping-dominated regime, the aS/S-ratio is
constant and equal to ρ = Aτ σS IL/(¯hωL).
IL/(¯hωL)
can be estimated with a good accuracy for a given exper-
imental setup. If A = 1 (no asymmetry between σS and
σaS) we can therefore deduce the product τ σS from the
plateau in the aS/S-ratio below Tcr. In general, and in
particular under SERS conditions, A 6= 1, but its value
can be determined from the exponential dependence in
the thermally-dominated regime (above Tcr).
In prac-
tice, a ﬁt of the experimental data over the whole tem-
perature range with two parameters enables to determine
both A and τ σS, as we shall show later. Nevertheless, the
problem of estimating τ still needs to be circumvented to
determine the SERS cross-section σS itself.

By reducing T , the contribution from pumping be-
comes dominant, making measurements much easier, and
more reliable. It also simpliﬁes greatly their interpreta-
tion. But the main advantage is that it enables one to
unambiguously rule out heating eﬀects as an alternative
explanation. As discussed, the appearance of plateaus
for T < Tcr in Fig. 1 is a clear characterization of the
pumping-dominated regime. Note that it does not mean
that there is no heating, but simply that its eﬀect on
aS/S-ratios is negligible (because they are dominated by
the pumping contribution). Any heating eﬀects may pos-
sibly aﬀect the value of Tcr, but as long as a plateau is
observed, vibrational pumping must occur. Moreover,
the value of ρ in the plateau region (from which we will
infer SERS cross-sections) is independent of heating.

Studies of the temperature dependence of ρ there-
fore provide a much clearer evidence for SERS pumping.
Notwithstanding, the technique is not without its draw-

method discussed here there are several issues that need
special attention. This is the subject of the next section.

III. PRACTICAL ESTIMATION OF
CROSS-SECTIONS FROM VIBRATIONAL
PUMPING

Several issues need to be considered in the practical de-
termination of SERS cross sections via vibrational pump-
ing. Not all of them can be resolved to a satisfactory
degree and ad-hoc approximations are needed to obtain
estimates of the cross sections. While there is nothing
intrinsically wrong with this, it is necessary to be aware
of the range of validity of the estimates in order to be
able to use them in a diﬀerent context, or to infer other
properties from them. We review these issues in the next
subsections.

A. SERS cross-sections

It is worth mentioning here that in most situations in
Raman (and in SERS) we talk plainly about the cross
section σ while in reality there are at least three possi-
ble cross sections we can refer to: (i) radiative, (ii) non-
radiative, and (iii) total. In the case of vibrational pump-
ing, for example, the rate at which vibrations are pumped
into the molecule is proportional to the total cross sec-
tion. But some of the re-emitted photons might not be
observable in the far-ﬁeld because they are absorbed by
plasmon resonances in the vicinity of the probe. This is
what makes the distinction between radiative and non-
radiative cross sections. This could lead potentially to in-
consistencies among cross sections for diﬀerent modes if
they happen at frequencies where the non-radiative con-
tributions are diﬀerent. We will not insist in this distinc-
tion in what follows, but it is worth keeping in mind that
as far as the cross sections is concerned what we measure
is the “radiative” part of an eﬀect (pumping) which de-
pends on the “total” (radiative plus non-radiative) cross
section. This distinction could be important if inconsis-
tencies are detected.

B. Vibrational lifetimes

We summarize in this subsection the diﬀerent aspects
of the problem of lifetime estimation for the purpose of
obtaining SERS cross sections.

• Ultimately, the observation of a cross-over from
a thermally-dominated to a pumping-dominated
aS/S-ratio leads to an estimation of both the asym-
metry factor A and the product τ σS. An estimation
of σS itself requires the knowledge of τ , as pointed
out before. The latter cannot be directly obtained,
in general, from the SERS spectrum. This leads to

4

a standoﬀ and a serious limitation of this technique.
A series of approximations can be justiﬁed, to some
degree, to obtain an estimation of σS regardless of
this problem. In the ﬁrst report of cross section es-
timation via vibrational pumping[13] a lifetime of
τ ∼ 10 ps was simply estimated without any refer-
ence to the experimental data.

• In order to proceed any further from the obtained
value of τ σS to an estimation of σS itself, we need
to make a series of assumptions. The validity of
these assumptions needs to be evaluated on a case-
by-case basis and the results obtained for the cross
section have to be interpreted within these approx-
imations/assumptions.

• Raman peaks in molecules have lineshapes which
are seldom pure Lorentzians and have several con-
tributions to their natural widths; a subject of a
longstanding history in spectroscopy[22]. The ob-
served linewidth has typically contributions from:
(i) groups of Raman modes piled up together in
narrow energy regions; (ii) inhomogeneous broad-
ening, (iii) phase coherence relaxation, and (iv)
The last two are also
population relaxation.
known as the oﬀ-diagonal (dephasing) and diag-
onal (population) relaxation times in density ma-
trix formalism[22], respectively, and are part of the
homogeneous broadening of the peak. These re-
laxation times are diﬀerent from mode to mode
and cannot be easily separated from the observed
linewidth in a plain SERS spectrum. The popula-
tion relaxation is the one we need (τ ) for the esti-
mation of σS.

• The presence of multiple modes contributing to
a peak is a drawback that can be overcome in

the observed peaks come from several Raman ac-
tive modes closely spaced in energy and with dif-
ferent cross sections. This will naturally result in
distortions of the lineshape and problems with any
estimate of the lifetime based on the width of the
peak. This can be overcome by the use of well char-
acterized vibrations which are relatively isolated
from the others and even (if possible) complement-
ing the information by density functional theory
(DFT) calculations of the Raman spectra[23, 24]
to support the selection of those modes that are
best candidates for a reliable estimation of τ .

• If the broadening is homogeneous[25], the only re-
maining contributions to the linewidth are the diag-
onal and oﬀ-diagonal relaxation times. Molecular
vibrations have typically very strong anharmonic
couplings with other vibrations in the molecule
and contributions to inhomogeneous broadenings
are mostly negligible. Even in SERS experiments
where the single molecule limit is approached[26]

(which would be more sensitive to inhomoge-
neous broadening) the full width at half maximum
(FWHM), Γ, of the peaks does not change by more
than 1 − 1.5 cm−1 in peaks with a typical Γ of
∼ 15 − 20 cm−1. The validity of this assumption
(whether inhomogeneous broadening is important
or not) has to be assessed obviously in each speciﬁc
situation.

• The separation between diagonal and oﬀ-diagonal
relaxation times cannot be achieved by a simple
SERS spectrum. It is always possible to invoke a
diﬀerent type of spectroscopy (time resolved)[22],
but this may not be feasible in most situations.
One simple possibility (as done in Ref.
[20]) is
to estimate the population relaxation by using the
FWHM (Γ) of the peaks via τ ∼ ¯h/Γ; i.e. essen-
tially ignoring the contribution of the dephasing
(oﬀ-diagonal) relaxation to the width. This will
produce an underestimation of τ and an overesti-
mation of σS. In addition, this produces typically
cross-sections for diﬀerent peaks which are not en-
tirely consistent with the relative (integrated) in-
tensities among peaks; thus showing an intrinsic
inconsistency in the estimation of the τ ’s (which
can be of the order of a factor of 2 to 10 for the
examples we examined). It is generally diﬃcult to
make a simple estimation that will be valid for all
modes. It is quite clear that for the cross sections
to be meaningful (and if they are not aﬀected by
diﬀerent amounts of non-radiative processes) the
relative cross sections among peaks must be in ac-
cordance with the relative integrated intensities ob-
served in a normal SERS spectrum.

• Population relaxation is caused mainly by the an-
harmonic coupling to the “thermal bath”. This
bath includes all other modes in the molecule as
well as those in the solvent or substrate. Gener-
ally speaking, higher energy modes have shorter
lifetimes due to a greater number of possible de-
cay pathways. Intramolecular anharmonic decays
are energy conserving, meaning that high energy
modes have more possibilities for a decay than low
energy ones. Population relaxation is also the only
dynamical process that contributes to the vibra-
tional linewidth in the limit T → 0.

• It is important to realize that, in principle, if we
ﬁnd a single peak in the spectrum where the pop-
ulation relaxation can be gained directly from the
FWHM via τ ∼ ¯h/Γ, then all of the cross sections
of the other modes follow immediately through the
relative integrated intensities of the peaks. When
lacking a time resolved experiment to isolate the
contributions properly, the problem comes down to
a judicious choice of a mode where the width is
dominated by relaxation population. A compromise
then is to extract the values of the cross sections

5

by means of the width of the highest (isolated) Ra-
man active mode. A rule of thumb is that the lower
the temperature and the higher the energy of the
mode the more the linewidth will be dominated by
population relaxation. We can then use one mode
to estimate its σS, and all the others follow auto-
matically from this assumption. The cross sections
are now consistent by construction and the method
provides, in fact, the means to estimate the relative
lifetimes of the modes. We call this procedure the
corrected lifetime method (CLM).

• If we are comparing diﬀerent substrates with the
same analyte we could also compare directly the
values of τ σS without any further assumption. If
there is no reason to believe that relaxation popu-
lation is diﬀerent between the two substrates, the
ratio of τ σS for two diﬀerent substrates provides a
direct comparison of SERS cross sections.

C. The asymmetry factor

• Problems with measuring the asymmetry factor
“A” can be as important as those to obtain a reli-
able lifetime. Heating in the thermally-dominated
regime can be a major problem. As demonstrated
in Sec. II B, heating can be in part a source for a
larger than normal A, if it is not properly identiﬁed.

• Ideally, the best estimation of A can come from
measurements at RT with long integration times
and very low powers. The obtained A’s should be
more or less the same for a given analyte in the
presence of the same metal (they are mainly re-
lated to the local interaction of the dye with the
metal[21]).

• The product Aτ σS is measured with high accuracy
in the pumping dominated “plateau” at low tem-
peratures. Accordingly, the best use of the tech-
nique is to use one well-characterized analyte (with-
out photo-bleaching if possible) as a means to com-
pare the relative SERS cross-sections of the dye on
diﬀerent substrates of the same metal, by simple
comparison of the plateaus. The product Aτ σS is
perhaps the best “objective” comparison between
the cross sections of two substrates without any
assumption. However, it is also important to note
that the cross sections we are comparing are not the
average cross sections but rather a biased average
towards the highest cross sections in the sample, as
explained in the next subsection.

D. Which cross section do we really measure?

There are additional complications with the estimation
of the cross section. It is generally accepted that SERS

signals are dominated by the presence of “hot-spots” or
places with high local enhancements. The formulae pre-
sented above made implicitly the assumption that the
cross section is the same for all N molecules in the sam-
ple. The question we want to address now is: do we
obtain an estimate of the average cross section with this
method? We shall show in what follows that what we ac-
tually obtain from the experiment is an estimate which
is heavily biased towards the sites with the highest en-
hancements; i.e. the method provides an estimate of the
enhancements in hot-spots. This is of course and advan-
tage and a disadvantage at the same time. We show this
explicitly in this section.

aS/σi

We consider a number of molecules (i from 1 to N )
in the sample. Each molecule can have a diﬀerent anti-
aS) and Stokes (σi
Stokes, (σi
S) SERS cross sections (ac-
cording to the asymmetry factor Ai = σi
S for that
molecule). We assume for simplicity that the incident
power IL is the same for all. The rate equation for the
average phonon population ni of a vibrational mode of
one molecule, i, and its stationary state solution are given
by expressions similar to Eqs.
(1) and (2): Following
the other formulae in the previous sections, the Stokes
signal for this molecule is simply I i
SIL, while the
anti-Stokes signal is given by: I i
aSIL. The anti-
Stokes/Stokes ratio for this molecule, ρi, is given by an
expression similar to Eq. (5). If all the molecules expe-
rienced the same enhancements, then the total Stokes
and Anti-stokes intensities would be IS = N I i
S and
IaS = N I i
aS, and the ratio would be ρ = ρi. However,
if the molecules have diﬀerent cross sections (SERS en-
hancements), which is a much more realistic assumption,
we then have:

S = σi
aS = niσi

ously in Eq. (5), what we called A is now replaced by:

Note that this is not exactly the average of the Ai’s, i.e.

To understand the meaning of σE

S (E for Ensemble), we
need to understand the sources of non-uniformity. The
main variation is in the cross-sections, because of the
large diﬀerences in SERS enhancements at diﬀerent lo-
cations on the SERS substrate. We typically have val-
ues which are, say, 103 − 106 larger at hot-spots than in
other places. However, for a given molecule, the ratio
Ai = σi
S should not vary as much (at least not by
more than one order of magnitude). In fact, this ratio can
in a ﬁrst approximation be taken as a constant, which
is an intrinsic property of the adsorbed molecule/Ag
complex[21]. Assuming that Ai = A is the same for all
molecules, we simply get that AE = A, i.e. the A we
aS = Aσi
measure is the correct one. Moreover, using σi
S,
we can express σE
S only as:

S as a function of σi

aS/σi

σE
S =

hσ2
Si
hσSi

.

(16)

If the distribution of σS’s were fairly uniform (for ex-
ample a Gaussian around an average value with a small
standard deviation) then σE
S would be a good estimate of
the average of the distribution (slightly overestimated).
But this is far from reality in SERS conditions. A more
realistic situation is to have a small number of molecule
at a hot-spot (HS), and a large number of molecules
at non-HS positions. For the sake of argument, let us
demonstrate the eﬀect on this average by considering 103
molecules with one molecule at a HS and 999 molecules
at places with much lower enhancements. The expression
given above would give:

σE
S =

1(σHS

If there is a diﬀerence of a few orders of magnitude be-
tween the cross sections σHS
, the numerator is
then easily dominated by the one molecule at the HS (due
to the square). For the numerator, it is not as clear-cut,
it all depends on how much stronger the HS is and how
many molecules are at non-HS positions. But overall, the
denominator is likely to be dominated by σHS
S , possibly
slightly larger if the second contribution is not negligi-
ble. This shows that σE
S , perhaps slightly smaller.
A more quantitative argument is only possible if we had
a more realistic distribution of SERS enhancements for
a given substrate, but the qualitative conclusion is that
pumping experiments provide a good lower estimate of
the cross-section of the few molecules experiencing the
highest enhancements.

S ≈ σHS

E. Photo-bleaching

The last aspect we want to brieﬂy touch upon in
this analysis of cross section estimations via vibrational
pumping is photo-bleaching. The exact mechanisms of
photo-bleaching under SERS conditions are still poorly
understood and would deserve a full study in itself.
Photo-bleaching is particularly important in the method
we are describing here because it aﬀects the most those
molecules that are at HS’s (i.e. exposed to the largest
enhancements). At high power densities, for example,
the population of molecules at HS’s will be bleached and
this will change the measured cross section. Studying ρ
under photo-bleaching conditions could, in principle, tell
us something about this distribution. There is robust
experimental evidence that photo-bleaching can compli-
cate the analysis, produce experimental artifacts, and -to
a large extent- even decide the answer we obtain from
a speciﬁc experiment. This is added to several exper-
imental complications in aS/S-ratios which include the
fact that sometimes (depending on the dispersion of the
spectrometer) the anti-Stokes and Stokes sides cannot be
measured simultaneously. This implies a delay between
the two measurements and therefore a diﬀerence in expo-
sure times to the laser. By choosing a certain power level
we are, in a way, selecting the population of HS’s that we
are going to measure. We shall come back to this prob-
lem in the discussion of the results. A rule of thumb is
that larger laser spots with low power densities (but suf-
ﬁcient to produce detectable pumping), short integration
times, and non-resonant (with the dye) laser excitation,
are in general preferable for a more reliable estimate of
SERS cross sections. All possible measures should be
taken (including the type of scanning used) to address
and minimize the undesirable eﬀects of photo-bleaching.

IV. EXPERIMENTAL

We turn now to an experimental demonstration of the
principles underlined above. SERS measurements have
been performed on substrates formed by dried Ag col-
loids on silicon. The colloids were prepared using the
standard Lee and Meisel technique[27]. SERS active
samples were prepared by mixing the colloids with a
20 mM KCl solution in equal amounts. The analytes
were then added to give a concentration of 10−6 M in
each case. A small amount of this solution was then
dried on to a silicon substrate. The investigated analytes
are rhodamine 6G (RH6G), crystal violet (CV), and 3,3’-
diethyloxadicarbocyanine (DODC). Figure 2 shows the
basic SERS spectra of the used analytes. We shall show
the explicit temperature dependencies of the aS/S-ratios
for only a few modes (labelled in Fig. 2) while the ta-
bles show additional data for other modes. Samples were
mounted in a closed-cycle He-cryostat (CTI-Cryogenics)
with temperature control in the range 10 − 300 K. Ra-
man measurements were performed using several laser

7

lines of a Kr+ and Ar+-ion lasers which were focused
to a 20 µm diameter spot. The signal was collected us-
ing a high-numerical aperture photographic zoom lens
(Canon, ×10 magniﬁcation) onto the entrance slit of a
high-dispersion double-additive U1000 Jobin-Yvon spec-
trometer coupled to a liquid N2-cooled CCD detector.
Peaks were analyzed using standard Voigt functions with
subtracted backgrounds. The variation in the aS/S-ratio
with T for each mode was then ﬁtted to Eq. 5. For this
purpose, it is convenient to modify the expression to:

,

ln(ρ) = a + ln

b + e−¯hων /kB T
h
where a = ln(A), and b = τ σSIL/¯hωL which are the
(dimensionless) ﬁtted parameters. The τ ’s of the peaks
(necessary to obtain the cross sections) are estimated in
two diﬀerent ways following the prescriptions in Sec. III
A.

(18)

i

As discussed earlier, it is of critical importance that the
sample remains stable over the entire length of the exper-
iment. A range of integration times were used depend-
ing on the speciﬁc sample and measurement to achieve a
good signal to noise ratio for diﬀerent peaks, but power
densities were kept to a minimum compatible with the
observation of pumping and exposure to the beam was
minimized as much as possible in between changes of T .
We used ∼ 30 − 50 mW spread over the 20 µm diameter
spot. As the rate of photo-bleaching may change with
T [28] a suitable power density to ensure reasonable sta-
bility must be decided at RT, where the eﬀect is greatest.
The relatively large spot and low power densities have
the triple advantage of (i) reducing photo-bleaching to a
negligible level, (ii) reducing any indirect laser heating
eﬀects and (iii) improving the averaging over cluster ge-
ometries. Still, even under low power density excitation,
the choice of laser line can have an important eﬀect on
the measurement. An explicit example is shown in Fig. 3
for RH6G under 514 nm excitation. As explained in the
caption, this observation is compatible with a bleaching
of the HS’s with largest cross sections. Laser lines that
are strongly resonant with the probe molecule[21] should
be avoided so that the photo-stability of the analyte and
the accumulated exposure to the laser do not become
an issue in the interpretation and analysis of the data.
For that reason, we only concentrate hereafter on results
obtained with the 647 and 676 nm lines of a Kr+-laser.
These two lines are close enough to the visible (to proﬁt
fully from SERS enhancements) but, by the same token,
they do not produce excessive photo-bleaching for the
dyes under consideration here.

V. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Having all the theoretical tools from the previous sec-
tions, we can now easily scan through several experimen-
tal results that demonstrate the method in practice. Fig-
ure 4 shows the aS/S-ratios (ln(ρ)) vs. T , as measured

using the 676 nm line, for four modes of each of the inves-
tigated analytes. The solid lines represent the best ﬁt to
the experimental values using Eq. 18. A series of small
imperfections can be seen in the data for some modes,
but overall the behavior is very well represented by Eq.
18, with RH6G being the best example. The arrows in-
dicate the cross-over points (Tcr) between the thermally-
dominated and pumping-dominated regimes for all the
investigated modes. Tcr occurs at higher T ’s for higher
energy modes, as expected. The fact that pumping is ob-
served for each of the modes indicates that the eﬀect is
fairly general and should be observable for a large num-
ber of analytes for as long as σS is high enough to make
pumping observable at moderate power densities[29].

In order to transform these data into estimates of the
cross sections we need to address the diﬀerent methods of
estimating τ . Table I shows the experimental results for
RH6G taken with the 676 nm line. For the sake of com-
parison, we display the cross section by using two diﬀer-
ent estimations of the τ ’s. This gives a better idea of how
reliable these numbers are and how diﬀerences among
them should be interpreted. Table I shows both: (i) the
extraction of τ directly from the widths via τ ∼ ¯h/Γ
(this normally renders cross sections which are not fully
consistent with the relative integrated intensities of the
peaks), and (ii) the extraction of τ from the highest Ra-
man active mode and the subsequent adjustment of the
other cross-sections to agree with the relative integrated
intensities (as described in Sec. III A). A column with
relative intensities an cross-sections among modes is also
provided for completeness. The anti-Stokes cross sections
are obtained through the Stokes ones via the ﬁtted value
of the asymmetry parameter A from Eq. 18. These re-
sults prove the point that the estimation of the lifetime is
a crucial step in this method to transform the experimen-
tal values into an estimation of the cross sections them-
selves. The values should be interpreted within this as-
sumption, and their validity should be assessed on a case-
by-case basis. The preferred (more consistent) method is
of course the one that ensures the relative cross sections
to agree with the relative intensities of peaks; i.e. the
corrected τ ’s method.

Finally, we can discuss the eﬀect of estimating the cross
sections for two diﬀerent excitation wavelenghts. The
experiment is somewhat restricted in the choice of exci-
tations (to be compatible with photo-stability) but still
provides a hint of resonance contributions to the cross
sections with some limitations. Table II shows the cross-
sections obtained for RH6G, DODC, and CV for 647 and
676 nm excitations for diﬀerent modes. All the cross sec-
tions were obtained by the corrected lifetime method;
i.e. estimating the τ of the Raman active mode with the
largest Raman shift, and making the other cross-sections
consistent with this value through the relative integrated
intensities. It is worth noting that in this latter method
we only need (in principle) one temperature dependent
aS/S-ratio for the highest Raman active mode (judged to
be dominated by population relaxation). This together

8

with the plain SERS spectrum of the dye is enough to
estimate all the cross sections of the modes via the rela-
tive integrated intensities. The results will be consistent
(by construction) but not necessarily accurate (depend-
ing on the one mode that has been chosen to estimate
the initial cross section). The main conclusions of these
experiments can be summarized as follows: (i) RH6G
shows larger cross-sections at 647 than at 676 nm. This
is consistent with a resonant increase known to exists
in RH6G towards the yellow part of the spectrum[21].
(ii) On the contrary, both DODC and CV experience
larger cross-sections at 676 nm, consistent with the max-
imum of the absorption of these dyes being at longer
wavelengths with respect to RH6G and, therefore, hav-
ing a much more red-shifted resonant interaction than
RH6G[21]. (iii) Although there is some variations from
mode to mode, it is generally true that CV experiences
the largest cross-sections in this near-IR region. Table II
summarizes therefore a typical example where the perfor-
mance of diﬀerent dyes can be tested through appropriate
estimates of the cross sections derived from the method
presented in this paper.

VI. CONCLUSIONS

We have presented an in-depth discussion of the state-
of-the-art of SERS cross section estimation via vibra-
tional pumping and have given several experimental ex-
amples of it. Despite the approximations needed and the
intrinsic problems of the technique, it is still an excellent
tool (and in many cases possibly the only tool) to extract
an estimation of the SERS cross-sections in situations
where the number of molecules and hot-spots presents
in the sample are not known or are diﬃcult to estimate.
The self-normalizing nature of the method (with respect
to the number of molecules involved) is certainly a major
advantage. In addition, we feel that these latter experi-
mental and theoretical developments have moved forward
to establish vibrational pumping as a real phenomenon in
SERS after almost a decade of controversy about its very
existence. One outstanding issue that surely deserves fur-
ther investigation is the eﬀect of photo-bleaching under
SERS conditions (in particular in HS). As we showed in
Sec. III B, the fact that this technique produces an esti-
mate of the cross sections which is heavily biased towards
HS’s provides a unique opportunity to explore their char-
acteristics. This is particularly true in the comparison
among diﬀerent substrates (in which the photo-stability
of the analyte plays a special role). A forthcoming study
on the topic is in preparation and will be published else-
where.

FIG. 1: Schematic diagram showing the temperature depen-
dence of the anti-Stokes/Stokes ratio (ρ) for several diﬀerent
Raman modes. We have assumed here A = 1 for simplicity
and have used three characteristic Raman modes of RH6G for
the example. The solid lines represent the ratio when there
is no pumping contribution (Bolztmann factor). The dashed
lines show the result of including pumping as given by Eq.
5. There are two regimes, one at high temperature where
the thermal contributions dominate and the ratio is similar
to what is expected if no pumping were present. The second
occurs at low T ’s where the contribution of pumping becomes
signiﬁcant relative to the thermal contribution. We refer to
the cross-over point between these two regimes as the Tcr (in-
dicated by the arrows in this ﬁgure). Tcr generally occurs at
higher T ’s for higher energy modes due to the diﬀerent inﬂu-
ence of the exponential factor for diﬀerent mode energies in
Eq. 5. See text for further details.

TABLE II: Cross-section values for the Stokes and anti-Stokes Raman modes of CV, RH6G and DODC extracted from b =
τ σSIL/¯hωL obtained through ﬁtting the experimental data to Eq. 18 for both the 647 and 676 nm lasers. Only the lifetime of
the mode with the largest Raman shift is estimated from its width and the other cross sections are made consistent with this
determination via the relative integrated intensities (CLM- or “corrected τ ’s” method in Sec. III A). See the text for further
details.

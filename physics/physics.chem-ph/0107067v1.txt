Abstract

From a variety of long simulations of all-atom butane using both stochastic and
fully-solved molecular dynamics, we have uncovered striking generic behavior which
also occurs in one-dimensional systems. We ﬁnd an apparently universal distribution
of transition event durations, as well as a characteristic speed proﬁle along the reaction
coordinate. An approximate analytic distribution of event durations, derived from
a one-dimensional model, correctly predicts the asymptotic behavior of the universal
distribution for both short and long durations.

1 Introduction

Ensuring appropriate behavior in molecular simulations has long been a topic of interest,
and butane has been an important test molecule as the simplest alkane with a dihedral
degree of freedom.
In early work on united-atom models Rebertus, Berne and Chandler
considered solvent eﬀects on butane conformational equilibrium [1], while Levy, Karplus and
McCammon studied stochastic butane dynamics [2]. Pastor and Karplus later investigated
the importance of inertial eﬀects in Langevin dynamics, also using a united atom model of
butane [3]. Tobias and Brooks discussed the importance of including hydrogen atoms when
considering solvent eﬀects [4].

One focus of molecular studies has been the dependence of transition rates on the choice
of dynamics. In a study of ethylene glycol, which is polar but also possesses a single dihedral
angle, Widmalm and Pastor compared rates and other timescales in molecular and Langevin
dynamics [5]. Similarly, Loncharich, Brooks and Pastor explored the eﬀects of the Langevin
friction constant on transitions rates in the larger “NAMA” molecule with an eye toward
speeding up the generation of conformational ensembles in peptides and proteins [6].

Work in one-dimensional systems, in addition to considering the eﬀects of stochastic
dynamics on reaction rates (e.g., [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]), has explored transition phenomena on
still-shorter “microscopic” timescales. Dykman and coworkers have extensively investigated
the eﬀects of diﬀerent noise types and non-equilibrium driving forces on transition events
themselves in stochastic settings [13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18]. The present authors previously
considered the inﬂuence of the local, non-uniform speed along the reaction coordinate on a
“dynamic importance sampling” approach to rate computations [19].

Many “microscopic” questions have remained unanswered regarding molecular transition
events. What is their duration? Is the reaction coordinate traversed at a uniform speed,
or is progress more rapid in some regions? Is there sensitivity to the choice of dynamics
or potential? The need for detailed answers is more pressing in molecular systems because
dynamic importance sampling [20, 21, 19] and “transition path sampling” methods [22, 23]
for computing reaction rates require ensembles of transition event trajectories. A quantitative
understanding of transition events could accelerate ensemble generation in these approaches,
making larger systems amenable to study. Moreover, because ensembles of transition events
are required for rate estimates, the durations set a fundamental minimum on the computer
time required to perform such calculations [19].

The present study provides answers to these questions, using a spectrum of simulations.
First, using the CHARMM potential, all-atom butane is studied in explicit water and acetic
acid. Low- and high-friction Langevin simulations are also performed with CHARMM, along
with a separate high-friction run using the AMBER potential. We compare the butane event-
duration distributions and reaction-coordinate speed proﬁles with those for one dimensional
stochastic systems with white and colored noise.

Two interesting generic features emerge. First, after a simple linear re-scaling by the av-
erage, the distribution of transition event durations appears to be universal across dynamics,
solvent, and potential type — regardless of whether butane or a one-dimensional system is
considered. The distribution embodies behaviors predicted analytically from a simple one-
dimensional model. Second, the reaction-coordinate speed proﬁles of butane transitions also
display a common, accelerating trend, which matches that of colored-noise, one-dimensional

2 Simulation Models and Set-Up

Transition behavior was studied in a variety of settings — from all-atom, fully solvated molec-
ular dynamics to one-dimensional Langevin dynamics. This section describes the protocols
and parameters used.

2.1 Fully-Solvated All-Atom Models of Butane

To examine solvent eﬀects on barrier crossing behavior, and to ensure a good standard
of comparison for stochastic simulations, we performed two explicit solvent simulations of

butane.
cases the CHARMM program and parameters was used. The butane molecule was lightly
restrained to the center of the simulation cell using a harmonic, molecule-speciﬁc, center-of-
mass energy term. The simulations were performed with constant pressure and temperature
and a non-bonded list cut-oﬀ of 12 ˚A. The non-bonded list was generated to 15 ˚A and the van
der Waals force switched to zero over a 12 ˚A distance. Electrostatics were shifted over the
full 15 ˚A range to cut-oﬀ. Dynamics used the leapfrog algorithm (e.g., [24]) in CHARMM,
which for each particle’s position x and velocity v is given by

x(t+∆t) = x(t) + ∆t v(t+ 1

where f =

xU for potential energy U and m is the particle’s mass.

The acetic acid simulations consisted of 253 explicit molecules of acetic acid and box
dimensions of roughly 65 ˚A on a side. This created the appropriate density of solvent for a
temperature of 300 K. The water simulations contained 861 TIP3 water molecules and used
a box size of roughly 30 ˚A.

2.2 All-Atom Butane in a Stochastic “Solvent”

To maintain as much consistency as possible between the explicit solvent and the implicit
solvent simulations, the stochastic simulations used similar options to the explicit solvent
simulations. In particular, the non-bonded energies were cut oﬀ at 12 ˚A, and a center-of-
mass restraint was again used on the butane molecule. Temperature was maintained at 300
K. As would be expected, no periodic images were used and there is no pressure control in
these stochastic simulations. Dynamics were performed with the leapfrog Langevin dynamics
integrator in CHARMM, namely [6],

where R is a white-noise frictional force, every component of which is chosen from a Gaussian
distribution of zero mean and variance 2mγkBT /∆t. We used two values of the friction
parameter (γ = 5, 50 ps−1) to implicitly model solvent eﬀects; only the carbon atoms were
treated stochastically, while the hydrogen dynamics were governed by the ordinary (γ = 0)
leapfrog Verlet algorithm (1).

An additional Langevin simulation was performed using the AMBER potential within
the Molecular Modeling Tool Kit (MMTK) [25]. For this “overdamped” (“Brownian”) sim-
ulation, dynamics were governed by

x(t + ∆t) = x(t) + (f/mγ)∆t + ∆xR

The noise term ∆xR was also chosen to be “white” — in this case, selected independently
at every time step from a Gaussian of zero mean and variance

σ2 = 2∆tkBT /mγ .

All atoms were treated stochastically using the convenient, but we note that overdamped
dynamics only make predictions relative to an arbitrary overall timescale [3] embodied here
in the (convenient) choice γ = 150.

This section discusses an extremely idealized potential characterized by a transition-
event-duration distribution with features common among all of the models studied. The
reader solely interested in the simulation results could safely pass over this discussion and
refer to the asymptotic results quoted later.

The one-dimensional potential is shown in Fig. 3, and the initial state A is deﬁned to be
x < 2 and state B is x > 3. The motivation for studying such an unphysical model is based
on the fundamental observation made in the present report (see next section): because the
distribution of durations appears to be universal, it should be derivable from even a trivial
model.

The analysis is based on the simulation-step probabilities governing the overdamped

dynamics (6) with white noise. Explicitly, the potential of Fig. 3 is given by

For convenience, we introduce the notation δx
f ∆t/mγ = Eb∆t/mγL for the inclined
region 2 < x/L < 3. Because ﬂuctuation increments ∆xR are chosen from a Gaussian

The relative probability of a given event duration, tb = nb∆t, is a product of two factors:
(i) the total number of probable nb-step trajectories — whether crossing or not — multiplied
by (ii) the fraction of nb-step trajectories which cross the barrier (i.e., reach the barrier top
3; see Fig. 3). Factor (i) is proportional to σnb, because the ﬂuctuation width in

(10) measures the extent of probable steps. The second factor, the fraction of successful
trajectories, may be written formally as

where the indicator function hY (x) is unity when x is in state Y and zero otherwise. That is,
the probability of a transition event occurring in nb = tb/∆t steps is proportional to σnbfb.
We estimate the fraction of successful trajectories, fb, by considering only those tra-
jectories near to the optimal nb-step crossing trajectory (which diﬀers from the unique,
overall-optimal trajectory — for the the optimal nb — discussed in [19]). The optimal nb-
step trajectory for the constant-force potential of Fig. 3 consists of uniform steps of length
L/nb, and we estimate the number of nearby trajectories as those occurring in a “ﬂuctuation
volume” σnb about the optimal; that is, we estimate

4.1 Transition-Event Durations

We here present results regarding the durations of transition events, tb; see Fig. 1. The
universal behavior of the distribution of durations is demonstrated, and limiting behavior is
discussed by comparison to the analysis of the previous section. The average durations are
also compared to other timescales which distinguish each system, the correlation time and
inverse reaction rate.

Both butane and one-dimensional simulation data are shown, and the probability density function,
p, is plotted for the durations normalized by the average of each data set. The lower plot, shows
identical data on a logarithmic scale to show the common behavior in the tails of the distributions.
The butane data sets represent water- and acetic-acid-solvated molecular dynamics (MD) with the
CHARMM potential, as well as low- and high-friction Langevin dynamics (LD) with CHARMM,
plus a high-friction (overdamped) Langevin simulation using AMBER. In one dimension (1D),
overdamped Langevin dynamics were used, with both white and colored noise. The empirical ﬁt is
given in (19) and discussed in the text.

The deﬁnition of a transition duration is necessarily somewhat arbitrary. Here we used
the time between the last exit from the initial state and the ﬁrst entrance to the ﬁnal state;
in other words, tb is the amount of time spent continuously by a trajectory in the transition
and trans states in butane, we chose the the
region. For transitions between the gauche
transition region to be 100 < φ < 150; considering symmetry, the region 210 < φ < 260 was
chosen for gauche+ and trans. Following convention, the trans state is centered at φ = 180.
The principal results for the distributions of event durations are embodied in Fig. 4.

The simple linear rescalings, by the system-speciﬁc average durations

below, conﬁrms the asymptotic behaviors predicted analytically in Eqs. (17) and (18): the
gap at small tb is clearly consistent with e−1/tb behavior (but not with a more common form
qe−tb with exponent q > 0), and the logarithmic scale of Fig. 4(b) reveals the large tb

behavior to be a simple exponential decay.

4.2 Timescales

Another question that can be answered based on our data is whether the crossing event
durations in a particular system are correlated with other fundamental timescales, like the
correlation time and the (inverse) reaction rates. Table 1 apparently answers this question
in the negative. Note that, in the table, the dihedral correlation time is deﬁned by

where the angular brackets refer here to time averages within the trans state only. Since the
dihedral-angle correlation function of the integrand exhibits strong oscillations in molecular
dynamics simulations, Table 1 also includes the decay time of the exponential “envelope,”
τdecay. The data also suggest that the rates are not simply related to correlation times.

4.3 Reaction-Coordinate Speed Proﬁles

The reaction-coordinate speed proﬁle [19] depicts the local speed of progress along the re-
action coordinate, as exempliﬁed in Fig. 5. This sub-picosecond behavior (see Table 1) is
uniquely available from simulations, and critically important for dynamic importance sam-
pling methods for rate calculations: see Ref. [19].

As in the case of the the crossing time distributions, the results tell a simple and consistent
story. All of the butane simulations show a characteristic “accelerating” speed proﬁle during
transitions, as indicated by Fig. 5. Absolute speeds do diﬀer, as is evident from the average
crossing times of Table 1. The consistent, accelerating proﬁles from the butane simulations
contrast sharply with the white-noise proﬁle of a one-dimensional simulation discussed in
detail in Ref. [19] and also shown in Fig. 6.

Because even the Langevin butane simulations — which were performed with white noise
— exhibit the accelerating behavior, one can also conclude that molecular ﬂuctuations are
inherently colored (i.e., correlated). The reason is straightforward. If one focuses on the
dynamics of particular butane atom, say a methyl carbon, then according to Eq. (6) that
atom moves based on the force it feels and a white noise increment. The force itself, however,
reﬂects the relatively long-timescale motions executed by the whole molecule. Hence the
molecule acts as its own memory, and correlations are not surprising regardless of the type
of noise modeled in ∆xR.

5 Summary and Conclusions

By comparing butane simulations with explicit and implicit solvents, along with simple
white- and colored-noise one-dimensional (1D) systems, we have found a remarkable degree
of commonality in short-timescale kinetic properties. The distributions of transition-event
durations tb from all systems studied substantially “collapse” onto a single universal function
after a simple linear rescaling (Fig. 4). Similarly, all the proﬁles of average local speeds
during traversal of the reaction coordinate — the “reaction-coordinate speed proﬁles” —
of the butane systems behave similarly (Fig. 5). These proﬁles, furthermore, qualitatively
match those from 1D colored-noise systems, but are clearly distinct from the 1D white-noise
behavior (Fig. 6).

Despite this universal short-time behavior, quantitative estimates for reaction-rate, cor-
relation, and event-duration timescales (Table 1) reveals no obvious relationship between
butane systems with explicit solvents and those with implicit, stochastic “solvent.” This
suggests that stochastic simulations, at least at the level considered here, cannot be used
for quantitative estimates of timescales in fully-solvated computations. While this assess-
ment may be more pessimistic than that of Widmalm and Pastor [5], it is not surprising
that consideration of an additional timescale, namely tb, makes agreement more diﬃcult.
Perhaps more important are two other issues: Do simple stochastic representations become
better or worse as larger molecules are considered? What quantity of explicit solvent, say
in combination with stochastic boundary conditions [27], provides a good level of agreement
with the array of kinetic quantities in fully-solvated systems?

Further theoretical consideration of the connection between simple and molecular systems
would also prove valuable.
In particular, the study of simple models possessing a one-
dimensional reaction coordinate coupled nontrivially to simple orthogonal degrees of freedom
(based on, e.g., [7, 8, 10, 11, 12]) should permit a better understanding of the eﬀects of noise
color on the short-time transition behavior considered here. In a molecular system, as noted
in Sec. 4.3, the eﬀective noise on any atom must be colored because of the coupling to the
non-trivial “bath” of other particles.

Following up on the motivation for the investigation reported here, we believe that an
appreciation of the results can inform improved sampling approaches for reaction rate com-
putations within the “transition path sampling” [22, 23] and “dynamic importance sampling”
[20, 21, 19] methods. These approaches require ensembles of transition-event trajectories.
At a simple level, understanding the transition event duration tb in molecular systems is crit-
ical: as noted in [19], the duration of molecular crossing events sets, in part, the minimum
computation time required to generate a realistic ensemble of transition-event trajectories.
Furthermore, given the universal behavior uncovered here, stochastic simulations evidently
reproduce key aspects of explicitly-solvated transition behavior. Despite the clear impor-
tance of solvent eﬀects, this study suggests that trajectories harvested in a computationally
inexpensive stochastic context should — at a minimum — provide good starting points for
reﬁnement in a solvated context.

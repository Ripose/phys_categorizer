Abstract

We have implemented a three-dimensional ﬁnite element approach, based on tricubic polynomials

in spherical coordinates, which solves the Schr¨odinger equation for scattering of a low energy

electron from a molecule, approximating the electron exchange as a local potential. The potential

is treated as a sum of three terms: electrostatic, exchange and polarization. The electrostatic term

can be extracted directly from ab initio codes (GAUSSIAN 98 in the work described here), while

the exchange term is approximated using diﬀerent local density functionals. A local polarization

potential approximately describes the long range attraction to the molecular target induced by the

scattering electron.

INTRODUCTION

Electron-molecule processes are important in many diﬀerent areas of physics and chem-

istry, for instance in cold plasmas (that are present in interstellar media [1] and the high

atmospheric layers). They are also relevant in radiation damage to living tissue, [2] and in

surface physics and chemistry for example in electron-beam induced chemistry.

[3] Theo-

retical studies of electron collisions with molecular targets have been carried out since the

late 1970s (see for example Refs. 4, 5, while Ref. 6 presents an extensive review of the

state of the ﬁeld up to the early 1980s). Some of the adopted techniques include the Kohn

variational principle, [7] the Schwinger variational principle [8] and the R-matrix method

[9] used in this study. These methods have proven capable of describing scattering from

increasingly complex molecular targets. [10, 11]

The need for a simple but general method to deal with electron scattering by a polyatomic

target, that does not utilize single center expansions or Gaussian basis functions has led us

to develop a new approach. Much of our motivation derives from our goal of describing

dissociative recombination reactions and the role of Rydberg states in these processes. Each

of the techniques that constitute our method has been widely used in the past, including

the use of ﬁnite elements in scattering processes, [12, 13] and the introduction of model

potentials to describe electron scattering. [4, 5] Nevertheless, to our knowledge, this is the

ﬁrst attempt to combine a three dimensional ﬁnite element calculation with the R-matrix

method. We hope that this approach can be used to calculate quantum defect parameters,

which can in turn describe vibrational-electronic coupling in polyatomic molecules through

an implementation of quantum defect theory (QDT) techniques.[14, 15, 16, 17]

For this pilot study we describe the electron-molecule interaction through an indepen-

2

dent particle picture. There are three main sources of interaction between a low-energy

electron and a closed shell molecule: the direct electrostatic interaction, which is always the

largest contribution to the potential, the exchange interaction, which makes the potential

nonlocal and derives from the antisymmetrization of the wavefunction, and a correlation

and polarization term that describes the response of the target to the continuum electron.

The polarization term is dealt with using a simple long range polarization potential.

The exchange term, due to its nonlocality, is the most complicated to model. We reduce

it to a local potential by adopting the widely employed local density approximation (LDA).

While this is a rather crude approximation to this term in the potential, it is well-known

that it gives surprisingly realistic results; moreover it enables us to reduce the solution of

the complicated scattering of an electron from a multielectronic target to the solution of an

eﬀective one-body Schr¨odinger equation with a local potential. This description is expected

to be realistic only for closed-shell molecular targets.

Finite element techniques are well established as ﬂexible tools to solve partial diﬀerential

equations in diﬀerent ﬁelds of physics, and in engineering. [18]

Their introduction to quantum mechanical calculations dates back to the work of Shertzer

and Botero, [12] who solved the scattering equations as a few-body problem. They have also

been implemented in a study of two-electron photoejection from atoms. [19] A study that is

closer in spirit to ours is the one by Weatherford, et. al. [13] which treats a simpliﬁed model

Hamiltonian in a system possessing cylindrical symmetry, reducing the calculation to just

two dimensions. The paper of Huo et. al. [20] uses instead an exact representation of the

exchange potential, using a Gaussian basis set at short distance, and adopts ﬁnite elements

only for the radial coordinate.

This operator contains both the nuclear and electronic degrees of freedom, indicated respec-

tively with Greek and Latin indices. We treat here the electronic problem alone, within the

Born-Oppenheimer approximation, namely freezing the nuclei in some deﬁnite conﬁguration

(usually the equilibrium conﬁguration) while solving for the electronic wavefunction. The

treatment of vibrations can be carried out by repeating the electronic calculations for diﬀer-

ent values of the nuclear positions, followed by vibrational averaging or a vibrational frame

transformation description. [21, 22] It is now possible to write a wavefunction that depends

parametrically on the nuclear coordinates as an antisymmetrized product of the target and

scattering electron wavefunctions:

Ψγ = A

Φγ′(¯i, R)φ0,γ′(ri)

Xγ′

(2)

where γ represents the set of quantum numbers that fully describe the state of the system,

and the sum over γ′ allows for diﬀerent conﬁgurations of the compound system (target +

scattered electron) to contribute. In Eq. 2 ¯i represents the coordinates of all the electrons

except the i-th.

If only the ground state conﬁguration γ′ in this sum is retained, the approximation made

4

is called static exchange. It is possible to show [23] in this case that the (N + 1)-particle

Schr¨odinger equation can be reduced to N + 1 single particle equations for the individual

orbitals. We are interested in the orbital φ0 for the scattered electron, which obeys

B. R-matrix method

The R-matrix method is a well-established tool for problems where the continuum portion

of the spectrum of a Hamiltonian must be treated. In its usual implementation, it involves

diagonalization of the (Bloch-modiﬁed) Hamiltonian operator in a box subject to some ﬁxed

boundary condition obeyed by the basis orbitals. The R-matrix box partitions the space in

two, with an internal reaction zone, to which all the short-range interactions are conﬁned,

and an external zone, where instead either no potential is present or there is a long range

Coulomb or dipole potential (or both), and the behavior of the solutions of the Schr¨odinger

equation is very simple. In some studies, other long-range multipole potentials are included

in the external zone.

[24, 25] We use the R-matrix method in the eigenchannel form.[26]

In this case we seek those stationary states for which the logarithmic derivative of the

5

(5)

(7)

wavefunction at the surface of the R-matrix box is constant at every point. Refs. 27, 28, 29

derive a new variational principle,

for the logarithmic derivative of the wavefunction.

If Ψ is discretized in some basis set

inside a spherical box, within which all the short range dynamics is localized, this results in

a generalized eigenvalue problem for b:

where Λ is the overlap of the basis functions calculated on the surface of the R-matrix box

and ˆL is the Bloch operator,deﬁned as

Γ ~C = (E − H − L) ~C = Λ ~Cb

ˆL =

δ(r − r0)

∂

and r0 is the radius of the box. The eigenvector ~C represents the expansion coeﬃcients of

the basis set used. Both Γ and Λ are deﬁned in the appendix for the ﬁnite element basis

set used in this work. It is possible to partition the basis functions in two subspaces, closed

and open, depending on whether their value at the surface of the box is zero or nonzero.[26]

This allows us to reduce the burden of the solution of Eq. 6 to the easier task of solving a

much smaller eigenvalue problem of type

Ω ~Co = (Γoo − ΓocΓ

~Cob

in the open functions subspace, in addition to the large auxiliary system of equations:

~Cc = −Γco

~Co

(9)

where the subscripts indicate the matrix blocks. At the boundary of the R-matrix box Ψ

is matched to an external solution depending on the long range tail of the potential (Bessel

functions for neutral molecules, Coulomb functions for molecular ions). This allows us to

calculate the reaction matrix K, from which the scattering matrix is derived as

S =

1 + iK
1 − iK

(10)

Scattering cross sections can then be calculated in the standard manner.

C. Finite element method

The essence of the ﬁnite element method is the use of a basis set that is deﬁned over

small local regions. By this we mean that each basis function is nonzero only within a small

region, and it has a simple polynomial form. By using many “sectors” or “elements” (the

volume over which the local basis function is deﬁned) though, it is possible to reproduce

very complex features of the solutions to the diﬀerential equation of interest. We discretize

Ψ using ﬁnite element polynomials in all three dimensions. The basis set is a direct product

of 4 cubic Hermite polynomials deﬁned locally in each sector for each dimension. The use

of a spherical coordinate grid, in r, θ, φ makes the boundaries of the sectors simple and the

three-dimensional integrals (the main bottleneck of these calculations) faster to calculate.

The ﬁnite element basis set is composed of piecewise polynomials, which provides ad-

7

vantages over a global variable representation. In particular one can treat potentials and

wavefunctions of complicated form by simply reducing the size of the elements in which the

polynomials are deﬁned, in those areas where ﬁne features arise. In our case the basis func-

tions are third order Hermite polynomials, which allow us to achieve function and derivative

continuity, while still permitting a simpler implementation compared to higher order poly-

nomials. Each polynomial is deﬁned in a hexahedral sector (a cube in the rescaled variables

used for the evaluation of the integrals), and since the wavefunction is discretized in terms

of ﬁnite elements in all three dimensions, the basis set is a direct product of 4 polynomials

in each dimension per sector, which means 64 basis functions are deﬁned in each sector.

In ﬁnite element analysis (FEA) the polynomials are matched with the ones in neighboring

sectors to ensure functional and derivative continuity (and mixed derivative continuity also,

in multidimensional FEA). Each sector has 8 physical nodes (at the edges of the cube) and

the basis functions deﬁned in the sector have coeﬃcients (to be determined by the solution of

the Schr¨odinger equation) that represent the value of the wavefunction, or its derivatives, at

the nodal point. In the language of ﬁnite element analysis, a node is the vertex of one of the

sectors into which the three-dimensional space is divided. The matching at the boundary

of each sector is imposed when assembling the global Hamiltonian matrix from the local

ones. The global index of functions that correspond to the same node and quantity (e. g.

derivative) in neighboring sectors has to be the same. Their matrix elements have hence to

be summed together. Details of the procedure are given in the appendix.

D.

Local Density Approximation (LDA)

Using an approach derived from Refs. 4, 5, we approximate the exchange integral (that

is nonlocal), by a local form using free electron gas (FEG) orbitals, [30] i.e. plane waves, for

8

the target molecule and using the ﬁrst order Born approximation

φ0 = Nei~k.~r

(11)

for the scattered electron. The arbitrary normalization constant N is unimportant and it

disappears as soon as we express the exchange functional as a product of a local exchange

potential times the scattered wave. After these substitutions are made, it is possible to

evaluate the integral on the right hand side of Eq. 3 analytically, obtaining a local potential

of the form

Vex(~r) = −

kF F (η),

π

whereas the Fermi momentum kF (the momentum of the electron that is at the top of the

Fermi sea in a free electron gas) is:

The other functions present in Eq. 12 are

where k is the modulus of the momentum of the scattered electron. It should be noticed

that the exchange potential in Eq. 12 is energy dependent.

Many functionals of this form exist, [4] with minor diﬀerences in the expression for k, the

scattering electron wavenumber. The functional we have used most successfully is the Hara

(15)

exchange [31] where

k =

2(E + I) + k2
F

(16)

and I is the ionization energy of the molecule while E is the energy of the incident electron,

this emerges from the assumption that the scattered electron and the electron in the highest

energy bound state (the Fermi electron, which has momentum kF ) move in the same potential

ﬁeld; Vex then depends only on ~r, through the electron density ρ(~r), as a local potential,

and on the energy, through the functional dependence of the momentum k as approximated

in Eq. 16.

We have also experimented with other functional forms of the exchange interaction (still

based on a FEG approximation). One in particular is the Slater exchange, [23] derived by

averaging the function F (η) over the momenta of all the electrons up to the Fermi level,

which has often been used to calculate bound states in atoms and molecules. However the

results using Slater exchange are unsatisfactory, presumably owing to the neglect of the

energy dependence in this model.

Since our main goal is to treat low energy scattering processes (0-10 eV) we linearize

the energy dependence of the functional in Eq. 14, in order to calculate the exchange

potential matrix elements at all energies at once. For a molecule like CO2, the matrix

element calculation requires around 2 hours on an Alpha 500 Mhz workstation. The next

step is the solution of the linear system and the determination of the scattering observables,

which requires approximately 15 minutes per energy desired, for a basis set size of 33000.

This step is trivially parallelizable, of course. The results improve upon inclusion of a

10

polarization potential

Vpol = −

2r4 (α0 + α2P2(cos θ))(1 − e

−(

rc )6

)

(17)

where rc is a distance parameter comparable to the range of the target charge distribu-

tion. When high accuracy is needed for resonance positions in some applications, rc can be

determined empirically [4] to reproduce the energies of one or more resonances of interest.

All the information needed to construct the potential matrix can be extracted from

standard ab initio quantum chemistry codes; in this work we have used GAUSSIAN 98.

The electrostatic potential and the electronic density (needed to construct the exchange

functional) for the target molecule are calculated on a uniform cubic grid at a CI (singles

and doubles) level for the molecules presented here. The diﬀerence in using an electrostatic

potential and density calculated at the RHF level or at the CI level for CO2 at its equilibrium

geometry amounts roughly to a diﬀerence of 10% in the calculated phase shifts and overall

magnitude of the elastic cross sections. These calculations usually require a minimal amount

of time, of the order of ten minutes per nuclear geometry for CO2 on the aforementioned

computational platform. The potentials are then interpolated on the three-dimensional

quadrature grid using ﬁfth order splines.

E. Computational Details

The three-dimensional integrals, as was mentioned above, are the bottleneck of the entire

procedure, making it highly desirable to minimize the time spent in their calculation. For

the sectors that do not contain a nucleus it is possible to use just 4 Gauss-Legendre points of

integration, since doubling the number of points changes the calculated phase shifts by only

11

about 10−6 radians, while increasing the computational time by approximately an order of

magnitude. Particular caution has to be observed when integrating over sectors that contain

a nucleus. We have found it important in general to have a ﬁnite element vertex on the

Coulomb singularity, in order to obtain correct results, and to use more integration points.

In these sectors we use 20 integration points in each dimension since we found that the

convergence of the phase shifts in this case is, as in the previous case, about 10−6.

The sparse structure of the ﬁnite element matrices (see Fig. 8) can be exploited with

great advantage from the beginning. No matter how the grid is deﬁned, each basis function

has matrix elements with at most 216 functions. This allows us to know the data structure

of the matrix Γ in Eq. 6 in advance and store just the nonzero elements, with a reduction

of memory cost of approximately two orders of magnitude. This economy is crucial to allow

us to perform three dimensional calculations in the ﬁrst place.

The dimension N of the eigensystem in Eq. 6 is, for CO2, of the order of 40000, whereas

for the open subspace it is only 100 or less. N increases rapidly with the complexity and

spatial extension of the molecular potential, but the sparsity of the matrices is high (about

0.5% full for N ∼ 40000 ), and it increases with the dimension of the system. Depending

on N we use diﬀerent techniques to solve the linear system in Eq. 9 : for small N we use

direct sparse LU factorization solvers (SuperLU); otherwise iterative biconjugate gradient

methods are used. Diﬀerent preconditioners have been tried in this context to speed up the

solution of the linear system, the one we have found to work the best for us is an incomplete

Choleski factorization, which reduces drastically the number of iterations with respect to a

diagonal preconditioner, the Γ matrix in Eq. 9 is not, in fact, diagonally dominant. Clearly,

the degree to which the factorization is carried out inﬂuences its nonzero structure. The

factorization is carried out to the extent that the original structure is preserved.

12

Iterative methods are slower than direct factorization, in the tests we have performed

normally the direct method is faster by a factor of ten, but for large systems an iterative

solver is essentially the only option, owing to memory limitations. Since the factorization

of a sparse matrix does not preserve the sparsity pattern, the factorized matrices present

storage problems, since a ﬁll-in factor of around 10 is common for these systems.

III. RESULTS

A. Neutral molecules

We have tested our approach in calculations of electron scattering by N2 and CO2, classic

benchmarks in this ﬁeld, [4, 32, 33] because their elastic cross sections exhibit striking

features that can be challenging to reproduce. The strong and narrow Πg resonance at 2.4

eV in N2 is reproduced in our calculations at the right energy, provided we use a physically

reasonable cutoﬀ radius rc = 2.8 a.u. for the polarization potential. The results are shown

in Fig. 4. The resonance is reproduced also at the static exchange level (without using a

long range polarization potential), but at an energy higher by approximately 1.5 eV.

For CO2 the main feature in the total elastic cross section is a Πu resonance at 3.8 eV. To

reproduce it at the correct energy we have to tune the polarization cutoﬀ radius to 2.4 a.u..

This feature is present also at the static exchange level, at 8 eV. The dependence on the

polarization, as one expects from the larger spatial extension, the larger number of electrons

and the greater asymmetry of this molecule, becomes much more pronounced than in N2.

The scattering cross section for this system is shown in Fig. 3 . The value of the cutoﬀ

radius for the polarizability potential, which is the only adjustable parameter in the model,

is reasonable. This is clear from Fig. 2 which demonstrates that this potential is appreciable

13

just outside the region where the main part of the electronic density is located. The results

are always in good agreement with previous theory, as shown in the ﬁgures. Vibrational

eﬀects tend to broaden these resonances in experimental elastic scattering cross sections,

and they also give rise to more structured resonance peaks, which are not considered in this

work. The present calculations have been performed for the molecular targets only at their

equilibrium distances. The values of the polarizabilities used in these calculations are [4]

α0 = 11.89a3

0 and α2 = 4.19a3

0 for N2 and [6] α0 = 17.9a3

0, α2 = 9.19a3

0 for CO2. It should be

pointed out that accurate static polarizability coeﬃcients α0 and α2 in Eq. 17 can also be

extracted from ab initio calculations. Generally, the low-lying shape resonances present in

these small molecules are spatially highly localized, which allows the radius of the R-matrix

box to be kept small, around 8 to 14 a.u. for the present calculations.

In the case of the third neutral molecule that we present here, ethylene, the situation is

more complicated. Since the target is now nonlinear it is more diﬃcult to describe it in a

discrete basis set and it is more expensive computationally to calculate the scattering cross

section. Nevertheless we are able to reproduce the features of the elastic cross section for

this molecule. We ﬁnd good agreement with the energies of the resonances and with the

overall cross section magnitude, compared with previous theory and also experimental data,

although the vibrational eﬀects again tend to broaden the resonance peak.

It should be noticed parenthetically that if we neglect exchange altogether in calculations

for all of the molecules presented here, the cross sections are qualitatively wrong, with

resonances far lower in energy than the experimental ones and in the wrong symmetry

channels. This is due to the fact that some of the target electrons are not bound anymore,

because the static potential is not attractive enough. Once added, the exchange potential is

basically an attractive local potential, resulting in the correct number of bound states for the

14

target; consequently the scattering resonances are generated by capture of the electron in

truly unoccupied molecular orbitals of the target. A more systematic study of the behavior

of the cross sections, when diﬀerent parts of the potential are neglected altogether, can be

found in Ref. 6.

B. Quantum defect calculations

It has been shown [34] that use of a local density approximation can often be eﬀective in

calculating molecular quantum defects, for bound or scattering states, for small closed-shell

target molecules. It is possible to calculate quantum defects from a scattering calculation

carried out near zero energy. The key step is to diagonalize the K-matrix

Kii′ =

Uiα tan πµαU T
αi′

α
X

and then utilize the relationship between the quantum defect and the scattering phase shift,

[26, 35]

δl = πµl

(18)

Accordingly quantum defects can be extracted from electron-scattering calculations at

positive or negative energies. These quantum defects can then be used to determine the

Born-Oppenheimer potential curves of the Rydberg states converging to the various ion-

ization thresholds through the Rydberg formula. [26] these can then be exploited through

MQDT techniques, to extract dynamical information on, for example, dissociative recom-

bination, [14] a process that we will study in the future using the machinery developed in

this paper. Here we show an example of how well this approach works for a simple diatomic

15

molecule.

We compare our results to the work of Sarpal and Tennyson [36] which made no ap-

proximation about the nature of the electron-molecule potential. It is possible to see that

the agreement is generally very good. The quantum defects represented in Fig. 6 are the

most important ones, higher symmetries and partial waves (l > 2) having very small phase

shifts at the low energies considered here. In electron scattering from an ionic target we

must account for the fact that heteronuclear molecules like HeH have a dipole moment, so

we must transform from the center of mass frame to a new frame centered on the center of

charge (the proton in this case). It is then possible to match to simple Coulomb functions at

the boundary of the box. Otherwise multipole potentials have to be included in the external

region.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper we have shown how a combination of the R-matrix method and a three-

dimensional ﬁnite element basis set can provide a promising tool for solving problems in

which a low-energy electron collides with a polyatomic molecule. It should be emphasized

that to perform three-dimensional calculations in a local basis set there is need for special

computational techniques, namely sparse matrix techniques. These calculations are in gen-

eral very complicated and time consuming, so some approximation must be made in order

to make them suﬃciently manageable. In the present work we approximate the exchange

term in the potential, which is nonlocal, as a local potential using the free electron gas ap-

proximation. The results are shown to be qualitatively accurate for a number of molecules

even in this rather crude approximation. Nevertheless there is room for improvement for

further work directed at treating exchange exactly and including relaxation of the target

16

orbitals in the presence of the scattering electron.

APPENDIX A: FINITE ELEMENT MATRICES

Starting from Eq. 6 we deﬁne the matrices Γ and Λ in our ﬁnite element basis trans-

forming ﬁrst to spherical coordinates (the box is spherical and the grid is also deﬁned in

spherical coordinates), and then to rescaled coordinates, which are the variables of the local

polynomials. In the rescaled variables each sector is transformed to a cube, in which the

range of each variable is from 0 to 1. The nodal structure of each element is represented in

Fig. 7 and the wavefunction inside each sector can be expanded as

u(ξ1, ξ2, ξ3) =

i(ξ1)ψm
ψl

j (ξ2)ψn

k (ξ3)C (lmn)

node

(A1)

Xi,j,k,l,m,n

where i, j, k can be 1 if the polynomial has nonzero value at some node or 2 if it has nonzero

derivative, whereas l, m, n can assume values of 0 if that node is the ﬁrst for the variable

of the polynomial in the sector or 1 if it is the last; ξi are the local rescaled variables . The

coeﬃcients C (lmn)

node are the values of the wavefunction and its derivatives at the node, and

17

they are to be determined solving Eq. 6. If we deﬁne

ak,p = xk,p,i+1 − xk,p,i

xk,p = ak,p ξk + xk,p,i

(A2)

(A3)

where k indexes the spherical coordinates and p the sectors in which they are deﬁned, xk,p,i

and xk,p,i+1 are the initial and ﬁnal points for the variable xk in sector p, the expressions for

the matrices become:

u(ξ1, ξ2, ξ3) amounts to require that the indices of the same node across neighboring sec-

tors be the same. This in turn leads to having to perform a sum of the integrals in Eq. A4

when evaluating the matrix element at a node, across all sectors that share that node.

FIG. 1: From this two dimensional cut in the radius r and the polar angle θ of the ﬁnite element
grid (for a CO2 target), it is possible to notice the ﬁner mesh near the oxygen nuclei localized at
r = 2.19 a.u. and θ = 0 and π respectively, while the carbon is located at the center of the grid.

FIG. 2: The three terms of the potential for a N2 molecule. The exchange potential is large only
at the nuclei (at r = −1.094 and r = 1.094 a.u. in the equilibrium conﬁguration of the molecule)
where the static potential is singular, so Vex is always much smaller than Vs. On the other hand
the polarization potential becomes important in the outer zone, where the electron density of the
molecule goes to zero.

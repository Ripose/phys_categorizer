Abstract

A semiclassical model is used to investigate the possibility of selectively exciting one of two

closely spaced, uncoupled Raman transitions. The duration of the intense pump pulse that creates

the Raman coherence is shorter than the vibrational period of a molecule (impulsive regime of

interaction). Pulse shapes are found that provide either enhancement or suppression of particular

vibrational excitations.

INTRODUCTION

Studies of molecular dynamics accompanying excitation, ionization, or dissociation give

rise to questions concerning the control of speciﬁc motion in molecules. Control using ul-

trafast lasers and adaptive learning algorithms, e.g., genetic-type algorithms [1, 2], allows

one to optimize feedback and achieve predetermined goals. Series of successful experiments

implementing this technique oﬀer proof that it is possible to exercise quantum coherent con-

trol over a range of processes. Two such experiments employ stimulated Raman scattering

in liquid methanol [2] and gas phase carbon dioxide [3]. In the former case a liquid medium

is excited with a 100 fs pulse, which is equivalent to non-impulsive Raman excitation and,

therefore, makes propagation eﬀects important. In the latter case the selective Raman exci-

tation of vibrational modes is achieved with a pulse of duration within a typical molecular

vibrational period. In this case the seed for the Stokes transitions is within the pump pulse.

In the experiment with methanol the problem of intra-molecular couplings of vibrational

modes is discussed using a comparative analysis with experiments on benzene and deuter-

ated benzene molecules. The controlling optical ﬁeld may be constructed using coherent

quantum control theory, see, e.g.

[4, 5]. An alternative approach involves a search for an

analytical pulse function. In [6, 7] an antisymmetric phase function is proposed, which in-

verts the sign of the electric ﬁeld at a given energy, inducing constructive interference of the

oﬀ-resonant components of the spectrum and therefore maximizing the transition amplitude.

Selectivity of the two Raman levels of pyridine, both of which lie within the bandwidth of

the excitation pulses is achieved in CARS signals by positioning the phase step at each of

the two peaks [8]. In [9] the use of adaptive techniques in FAST CARS is explored for an

identiﬁcation of related biological objects such as bacterial spores.

The Raman excitation of a single vibrational mode having frequency ω normally requires

a pulse with ωτ

1, where τ is the pulse duration. Optimal excitation may occur if the

≤

intensity is modulated at a frequency that corresponds to the transition frequency. For any
two vibrational modes ω1, ω2 within the pulse bandwidth, (ω1 −
width is too large to resolve the lines.

In the present paper we propose a method for

1, the spectral

achieving selective excitation using broadband pulses. In the frequency domain we introduce

an intensity envelope that vanishes for a modulation frequency of the pulse equal to the

frequency of vibration that we would like to suppress. The Fourier transformed ﬁeld, when

2

applied to a molecular system, provides negligible excitation of that particular frequency

together with signiﬁcant excitation of another frequency. This picture is valid for weak

ﬁelds. In strong ﬁelds the eﬀect is not obvious and numerical analysis reveals that, for some

intensities and the designed pulse shape, it is still possible to optimize one transition versus

another.

The paper is organized as follows. In the second section the problem is formulated based

on a model of two, two level systems. An analytical function for the intensity envelope is

proposed and the equations of motion for the state amplitudes are obtained. The third

section contains results of numerical calculations that determine the ﬁeld parameters that

lead to selective excitation. The paper is ended with a short summary.

II. BASIC FORMALISM

In our model a molecule is described by two, two-level quantum systems, each representing

a normal Raman-active vibrational mode. The molecular medium is represented by an

ensemble of such systems with no relaxation processes taken into account. Each two-level

system interacts with an intense oﬀ-resonant femtosecond pulse that initiates stimulated

Raman scattering via an oﬀ-resonant interaction with a virtual state. The duration of this

pump pulse is shorter than a typical vibrational period of a molecule.

In this case the

frequencies of both two-level systems are within the bandwidth of the pulse and the Stokes

component of the ﬁeld is supplied by the same pulse. The coherently excited ensemble is

analyzed by a weak probe pulse, not considered in this work, applied after a time delay

shorter than the coherence time. The goal of the present work is to determine a pulse shape

that provides selectivity for the excitation of one of the two-level systems.

A semiclassical model of laser-molecule interactions is used. The model is represented

schematically in Fig.1 where ω21 is the frequency of the ﬁrst two-level system and ω43 that

of the second system. Initially only lower levels

1 > and

3 > of both two-level systems

are populated, and the populations of these levels are equal. The time evolution of two,

two-level systems is described in terms of probability amplitudes, which are written in the

interaction representation

where ωp is the laser ﬁeld carrier frequency. By adiabatically eliminating state

the rotating wave approximation, we arrive at Eqs (1). In this work we discuss the case of un-

coupled two-level systems such that the probability for the population ﬂow from one system

to another via the external ﬁeld is zero. Then Eqs.(1) are represented by two independent

systems of coupled diﬀerential equations with two variables.

We propose an analytical function for the intensity envelope which is included in the

dynamical equations (1) for the probability amplitudes. It is easiest to choose this function

in the frequency domain. To suppress excitation at frequency ω21 and enhance excitation at

frequency ω43, we choose

to ω43 the intensity approaches its maximum I0 for a suﬃciently large parameter T1,

˜I(ω43) = I0(1

∆ω = ω43 −

ω21.

(4)

For ω equal to ω21 the intensity is zero, ˜I(ω21) = 0. The intensity envelope as a function of

frequency is drawn in Fig.2. The frequencies of the two-level systems are ω21=1 and ω43=1.1

in frequency units of ω21. The intensity of the ﬁeld at ω43 and frequency region near ω21 over
which ˜I(ω) is approximately zero depend on T1. The larger T1, the greater is the selectivity

for suppressing the ω21 frequency.

The inverse Fourier transform of the spectral density (3) is a complex function. To arrive

at a physically acceptable temporal pulse function, we take the real part of the inverse

Fourier transform, given by

The Fourier transform represented in Eq.(5) is not identical to Eq.(3), since we took the

real part of the Fourier transform to arrive at (5).

It now contains ”counter-rotating”

terms, which are small for the chosen pulse shape. Thus, by construction, we have totally

suppressed the 1-2 transition in the weak ﬁeld limit. On the other hand, the excitation of

the 3-4 transition is still weak owing to the perturbative nature of the solution.

Polyatomic molecules often possess several or many Raman active modes with frequencies

close enough to be within the bandwidth of the pulse. In order to enhance a single vibration

and suppress other vibrations the function for the pulse may be constructed as a product of

several terms

III. NUMERICAL RESULTS

In this section we discuss the results of numerical calculations based on the exact solution

of Eqs.(1). The numerical studies reveal the inﬂuence of the ﬁeld parameters on the eﬃciency

of the excitation of the two-level systems. Parameters for the system are taken from the

experimental data on impulsive excitation of vibrational modes in the molecular gas CO2

[2]. In CO2 the frequencies of two selectively excited Raman modes are 36.8 and 42 THz.

The FWHM of the applied intense pulse is taken equal to 18 THz. In our calculations the

frequency ω21 is set equal to unity; in these units the frequency ω43 is equal to 1.1. From

experimental data, we estimate that the parameter T is about equal to 3, in frequency units
of ω−1
21 . The intensity of the ﬁeld is determined by the parameter I0. The parameter T1 is
related to the width of the spectral dip in ˜I(ω) centered at frequency ω21. Although a value
of T1 ≫
restricted by the requirement that the duration of the applied pulse be within a typical

T would provide the best selectivity, the choice for the parameter T1 is strongly

molecular vibrational period. It turns out that even for such values of T1, it is possible to

selectively excite one transition.

We calculated the population distribution and the coherence of the excited and suppressed

two-level systems as a function of T1 as shown in Fig.3. Bold solid and dotted lines depict

the absolute value of the coherence

of the excited system and

of the suppressed

system. Populations of the upper levels of both systems are shown by bold dashed and

dot-dashed lines. The intensity of the ﬁeld I0 is π/8 which corresponds to a weak ﬁeld in

our calculations (but not to the perturbative regime). For the value T1 = 13 the population

of levels of the 3-4 system is 0.25, and the coherence is optimal for the given intensity of the

ﬁeld and dipole moments, (µi = 1). The duration of the laser pulse corresponding to this

value of the parameter T1 is about 200 fs which does not satisfy the necessary requirements

on pulse duration. According to Fig.3 for smaller values of the parameter T1, corresponding

to shorter pulses, the coherence of the 3-4 system is signiﬁcantly reduced with a simultaneous

increase of the coherence of the 1-2 system. Optimal values for the coherence of both the
1-2 and 3-4 systems were found for T1 ≤
ﬁeld.

the upper levels of both two-level systems. For the intense ﬁelds, coherence of the excited

and suppressed systems possess somewhat chaotic structure. Several values of the intensity,

e.g. I0 = π and I0 = 1.75π give rather low coherence of the 3-4 system but maximum

coherence of the 1-2 system. A desired solution for maximum coherence of the excited 3-4

system is achieved for the intensity coeﬃcient I0 = 2.08π. This is the result of redistribution

of population within that two-level system: half of population is transferred to the upper

level providing maximum coherence. The corresponding coherence of the 1-2 system at this

intensity is nearly zero, where most population remains in the lower level. For the intensity

I0 = 1.4π the picture is similar, however the low coherence of the 1-2 system is due to nearly

complete population transfer to the upper level.

The goal of control of the coherence of two uncoupled two-level systems is achieved with

a pulse shape possessing a broad spectral dip at the suppressed frequency and a suitably

chosen intensity of the ﬁeld. This technique allows one to use pulses of duration T to

selectively excite transitions having frequency separations ∆ω < 1/T . Our results should

not be taken to imply that one can spectroscopically determine frequencies to better than

the inverse temporal width of the pulse. On the other hand, if the frequencies are known

from previous measurements, it is possible to suppress one transition and enhance the other

by the method outlined above.

Had we taken a frequency proﬁle centered at ω43 with T = 3, the curves for the coherence

and populations of the excited and suppressed systems would diﬀer qualitatively from those

show in Fig.4. The desired selectivity could not be achieved.

The time-dependence of the coherence, populations and the ﬁeld is shown in Fig.5 for T =

3, T1 = 3, I0 = 1.4π. The pulse duration is about 50 fs (thin solid line). It induces oscillations

in the population distribution (thin lines) which lead to oscillations of the coherence of the

two-level systems (bold lines). At long times the coherence and populations of levels achieve

stationary values.

We have carried out some preliminary calculations, including the coupling between vibra-

tional modes via an external ﬁeld used as a control mechanism. If the direct excitation of a

particular vibrational mode is weak owing to a weak oscillator strength, the excitation may

be enhanced through the coupling to the other Raman active vibrational modes. Details

will be published in [11].

IV. SUMMARY

We have presented a semi-classical description of stimulated Raman scattering involving

the selective excitation of one of two closely spaced vibrational modes. The dynamics is

described in terms of probability amplitudes and depends on the shape of a femto-second

laser pulse where duration is shorter than a typical molecular vibrational period. We propose

an analytical function for the shape of the intensity envelop of the pulse that allows for the

selective excitation of a predetermined vibrational motion with simultaneous suppression

of an unfavorable one. The pulse leads to maximum coherence of a desired vibrational

transition and consequently to maximum gain into Raman side bands when a probe pulse

is applied. This pulse function may be used as an initial guess for the control of bond

excitation in chemistry as well as a ﬁt function within an adaptive learning algorithm.

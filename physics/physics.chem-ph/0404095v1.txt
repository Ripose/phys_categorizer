Computer-generated character tables and nuclear spin statistical weights: Application
to benzene dimer and methane dimer

In the assignment of high-resolution spectra of van der
Waals molecular clusters, it is of great utility to know the
character table of the molecular symmetry group and the
nuclear spin weights of the various rovibronic symmetry
species [1]. While their calculation is not diﬃcult, for
large groups it is lengthy [2] and prone to errors due to
the sheer quantity of variables involved. For the ben-
zene dimer, both the character table [3] and the nuclear
spin weights [4] have been published with errors (though
the latter had previously been published correctly [5]);
for methane dimer, the nuclear spin weights have been
published with an error [2].

We would like to bring to the attention of the spec-
troscopy community a free software package for group
theory named GAP [6], which greatly facilitates these
calculations. As an example of its usage, we present
calculations for the permutation-inversion (PI) groups of
benzene dimer, which is the direct product of a permu-
tation (P) group and the inversion group {E, E∗}, and
of methane dimer, for which a planar structure is not ac-
cessible and thus E∗ is not a feasible operation. For both
dimers, rigid monomer units are assumed. Calculations
for methane and benzene trimers, and water hexamer,
can be done in this way within a few seconds on a per-
sonal computer.

In what follows, we consider only the hydrogen atoms,
since the 12C isotope has nuclear spin zero. We label
the hydrogen atoms on the two benzene monomers 1 . . . 6
and 7 . . . 12, in a circular way. The permutation group
is speciﬁed by its generators, for example C6, C′
2, and τ
(monomer exchange), by entering at the GAP prompt:

b2P := Group( (1,2,3,4,5,6), (2,6)(3,5),

(1,7)(2,8)(3,9)(4,10)(5,11)(6,12) );

In the case of methane dimer, we introduce two ﬁctitious
atoms, 9 and 10, with nonphysical negative spin quan-
tum numbers, whose interchange symbolizes the inver-
sion. Generators of the PI group are C3, σ∗ (reﬂection-
inversion), C2, and τ :

m2PI := Group( (1,2,3), (1,2)(5,6)(9,10),

(1,2)(3,4), (1,5)(2,6)(3,7)(4,8) );

The computation of the nuclear spin weights of the
various rovibronic symmetry species is computed using
the formula of Ref. [7]. For each permutation cycle of
length n, permuting atoms of spin i, there is a factor
of (2i + 1)(−1)2i(n−1), except if the cycle symbolizes an
inversion, in which case the character value is zero:

CycleFactor := function(n,i)
if i < 0 then return 2-n;

else return (2*i+1)*(-1)^(2*i*(n-1));

fi; end;

The rovibronic character value of a permutation p acting
on a list of atoms k with spins s is the product of the
above factors for each cycle in the permutation, multi-
plied by 2 (for the two parity labels):

rveCharacterVal := function(p,k,s)
return 2*Product(Cycles(p,k),

c -> CycleFactor(Length(c),s[c[1]]));

end;

Looping this function over the conjugacy classes of a
group g yields the character of the allowed rovibronic
wave functions:

rveCharacter := function(g,s)

return List(ConjugacyClasses(g),

p -> rveCharacterVal(Elements(p)[1],
MovedPoints(g),s)); end;

Finally, decomposition of this character into irreducible
characters yields the nuclear spin weights of the diﬀerent
rovibronic species:

rveWeights := function(g,s)

return MatScalarProducts(Irr(g),
[rveCharacter(g,s)])[1]; end;

and

those

The spin weights of (C6H6)2 are computed with
rveWeights(b2P,0*[1..12]+1/2),
of
(C6D6)2 with rveWeights(b2P,0*[1..12]+1). Since
this calculation is based on the P group, parity labels
must be added to each symmetry species displayed in
the character table, and the above spin weights are
evenly split between even and odd symmetry species.
The character table of benzene dimer has been published
previously with errors in Ref.
the signs of the
character values of C3C3, line 10; C6C6, line 12; and

[3]:

C′′
2 C3, line 24, need to be inverted. In the ordering of
that table, the rovibronic spin weights of (C6H6)2 are 28,
21, 6, 3, 78, 91, 1, 0, 21, 91, 7, 39, 3, 13, 66, 55, 45, 36,
77, 63, 33, 27, 143, 117, 11, 9, 99, and those of (C6D6)2
are 4278, 4186, 741, 703, 2628, 2701, 1081, 1035, 3496,
6716, 4232, 2774, 1748, 3358, 6786, 6670, 7750, 7626,
10672, 11408, 4408, 4712, 8468, 9052, 5336, 5704, 14384.
The spin weights of (CD4)2 are computed with
rveWeights(m2PI,[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,-1,-1]), where
the last two spins are unphysical and designate the ﬁcti-
tious atoms whose exchange stands for the inversion op-
eration; the same calculation with spins 1/2 computes the
spin weights of (CH4)2. The character table of methane
dimer has been published previously [3]; in that ordering,
the rovibronic spin weights of (CH4)2 are 15, 15, 10, 10,
2, 0, 1, 1, 10, 15, 15, 6, 6, 3, 3, 6, and those of (CD4)2
are 120, 120, 105, 105, 42, 30, 36, 36, 180, 270, 270, 171,
171, 153, 153, 216.

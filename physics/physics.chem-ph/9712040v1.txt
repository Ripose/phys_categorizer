Abstract

We investigated the vibrational energies in the 2p 2A′′

2 and 3d 2E′′ states of the

triatomic deuterium molecule D3. The experiments were performed using a fast neutral

beam photoionization spectrometer recently developed at Freiburg. A depletion type

optical double-resonance scheme using two pulsed dye lasers was applied. The measured
vibrational frequencies of the 2p 2A′′
2 state of D3 are compared to those of H3 and to
theoretical values calculated from an ab initio potential energy surface. The data give

insight into the importance of the coupling between the valence electron and the ion

core.

Introduction

The triatomic hydrogen molecule, the simplest neutral polyatomic molecule, is ideally

suited to study fundamental aspects of the interaction between the electronic and the

nuclear motion. The molecule is suﬃciently small for high precision ab initio investiga-

tions of the potential energy surfaces to be successful [1, 2]. Excited states of H3 and

D3 were discovered by Herzberg and coworkers [3, 4, 5, 6] in emission from electrical

gas discharges in hydrogen and deuterium. All of the excited states are predissoci-

ated by coupling to the repulsive ground state potential energy surface except for the
single rotational state 2p 2A′′
a fast neutral beam by charge transfer of H+
2p 2A′′

2(N=K=0) state was used as a platform for laser-excitation/ionization experi-

2(N=K=0) which is metastable and can be prepared in

3 [7, 8, 9, 10] in cesium. The H3

3 or D+

ments in order to explore the Rydberg states of H3 and to determine their vibrational

frequencies [7, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17] .

In a recent investigation from this laboratory [18], we created a fast beam of rota-

tionless D3 molecules in the lowest vibrational levels of the 2p 2A′′

2 metastable state.

Following vibrationally diagonal excitation in the ultraviolet spectral range, we ob-

served ﬁve Rydberg series. Two series were detected by ﬁeld-ionization and assigned to
s– and d– type Rydberg states with a vibrationless D+

3 core. Three series were found

to consist of transitions from vibrationally symmetric stretch and degenerate mode
excited 2p 2A′′

2 states into auto-ionizing Rydberg states. In order to assign the core

vibrational excitation, we used preliminary results of a depletion type double resonance

experiment. A vibrationally non-diagonal transition which appears as a Fano type line

above the ﬁrst ionization limit allowed us to determine the ﬁrst symmetric stretch vi-
brational frequency of the D3 2p 2A′′
frequency of the 2p 2A′′

2 state, we used the molecular constants of the D+

2 state. In order to determine the degenerate mode

3 ion[19].

The objectives of the present investigation are threefold. First, we present the

results of double resonance experiments which conﬁrm the assignment of the Rydberg

states observed previously [18]. Secondly, we investigate vibrationally diagonal and non-
diagonal transitions from the 2p 2A′′
2 state to vibrationally ground and exited levels of
the 3d 2E′′ state. In this way, we determine the vibrational frequencies of the 2p 2A′′
2
and 3d 2E′′ states of D3. Third, we calculate the vibrational levels of the 2p 2A′′

2 states

of H3 and D3 with the potential energy surface published recently by Peng et al.

using the ﬁlter diagonalization method in the version of Mandelshtam and Taylor [20].

The comparison between the experimental data and the theoretical model gives insight

into the inﬂuence of the Rydberg electron on the bond strength. By using diﬀerent

isotopes, the potential energy surface is eﬀectively probed.

2 Experimental

In this study, we used the fast beam collinear spectrometer recently developed at
Freiburg [18]. Triatomic deuterium ions (D+

3 ) were created in a hollow cathode dis-

charge in deuterium (D2). The cathode was cooled by liquid nitrogen. The ions were

accelerated to an energy of 3.6 keV and mass selected by a Wien-ﬁlter. A small fraction

of the ions was neutralized by charge transfer in cesium vapor. After the charge-transfer

cell, the unreacted ions were removed by an electric ﬁeld. A 1 mm diameter aperture

located 30 cm downstream of the charge transfer cell was used to stop products of

dissociative charge transfer. Fast metastable molecules which entered the 120 cm long

laser-interaction region were excited by a counterpropagating pulsed dye laser beam.

Photoions were detected at the end of the interaction region by an energy analyzer

and a microsphere plate. A 200 MHz dual-counter was used to accumulate the signal

produced by the laser pulses and the background events separately. The data were then

transferred to a laboratory computer and stored for further treatment.

In order to perform depletion type double resonance experiments, we operated two

dye lasers pumped by an excimer laser. The wavelengths of both dye lasers were pro-

grammed and/or scanned under control of the laboratory computer. Using an optical

delay line, the pulses of one of the dye lasers (labelling laser) were delayed by about

15 ns with respect to the pulses of the other dye laser (excitation laser). Both laser

beams were merged by a beamsplitter before they entered the interaction region. The

labelling laser was operated at a ﬁxed wavelength, and used to excite a transition from
a speciﬁc vibrational level of the 2p 2A′′

2 state to a ﬁeld- or autoionizing state. The ion

signal was used to monitor the population in the lower state. The excitation laser was

scanned in the tuning ranges of the dyes Rhodamine 6G and Coumarin 307. Transi-

tions originating from the labelled lower state lead to a reduction of the ion signal and

appear as depletion dips in the spectra. The depletion technique is most eﬀective in the

case of transitions to upper states which are quickly predissociated. A long-lived upper

3

state may be ionized by a second photon from the same excitation laser pulse (1+1

REMPI) which reduces the depth of the depletion feature. In that case, the intensity

of the excitation laser was reduced by neutral density ﬁlters.

In order to calibrate the wavelength scales of the lasers, the optogalvanic signal

from a hollow cathode discharge in neon and argon was recorded, and the observed

lines were compared to tabulated values [22]. The Rank-formula [23] was used to

correct for the refractive index of air. The Doppler-shift due to the motion of the fast

neutral molecules was calculated from the acceleration voltage of the ion source. We
estimate the systematic uncertainty of the photon energy scale to be less than 0.2 cm−1.

3 Numerics

The signiﬁcance of any molecular eigenstate calculation, depends strongly on the qual-

ity of the potential energy surface (PES) on which it is performed. For computing the
low lying vibrational frequencies of H3 and D3 in the 2p 2A
2 state, we use the ﬁtted ab
initio potential energy surface of Peng et al.[2]. This seems to be a rather accurate ﬁt
(with only 5 cm−1 average deviation from its 1340 ab initio points [2]), thus enabeling

′′

us to make a rather precise prediction of its eigenstates.

¿From the various methods for computing vibrational states of small molecular sys-

tems, we use the low-storage version of the ﬁlter-diagonalization method introduced

recently by Mandelshtam and Taylor [20]. This method is conceptually based on the

ﬁlter-diagonalization procedure of Wall and Neuhauser [24] which extracts the system

eigenenergies by harmonic inversion of a time correlation function C(t). The method

of ref. [20] is designed to use a direct harmonic inversion of the Chebyshev correlation

function [21]

cn = hξ0|Tn( ˆH)|ξ0i ∼ X
k

dk cos nωk ,

for the eigenenergies Ek = cos ωk and amplitudes dk. The computation of the cn

sequence is done to essentially the machine precision using a very inexpensive iterative

numerical scheme,

ξ1 = ˆHξ0, . . . , ξn+1 = 2 ˆHξn − ξn−1 ,

with cn being generated using c2n = 2hξn|ξni−c0, c2n−1 = 2hξn−1|ξni−c1. This requires

to store only a few vectors at a time, if the matrix-vector multiplication is implemented

(1)

(2)

4

without explicit storage of the Hamiltonian matrix. The spectral analysis part (i.e.,

the harmonic inversion of cn by the ﬁlter-diagonalization) is carried out independently

and eﬃciently after the sequence cn is computed. All these features imply the very

high performance of the overall numerical procedure.
It is not hard to achieve a precision of the low lying states of ∆E/E = 10−4, because

their density of states is not high, and, therefore, the number of iterations can be small
(∼ 103), requiring only a few hours of CPU time on a RS6000/59H workstation.

We choose Radau coordinates, in which all mixed derivatives in the kinetic energy

vanish [25], to guarantee for a fast application of the Hamiltonian to a vector, which is

the bottleneck in iterative methods. However, this choice of coordinates implies that

C2v symmetry, rather than the full D3h symmetry of H3 (D3), is used in the calculation.
Nevertheless, E states can be identiﬁed as a numerically close pair of an A′ and an A′′

state [26].

We also use a sinc-DVR [27] for the radial and a Legendre-DVR for the angular part of

the Hamiltonian. The parameters deﬁning the grid are the size of the primitive sinc-

basis n1 = n2, which are truncated by a kinetic energy cutoﬀ to n1b = n2b, their spatial

extension from ri min to ri max(i = 1, 2), the size of the primitive basis of the Legendre

polynomials for the angular motion n3 and a three-dimensional potential energy cutoﬀ

Vcut. All primitive basis parameters have been adjusted in the one-dimensional problem,

with the remaining coordinates held ﬁxed to their equilibrium values. The details of

the convergence procedure will be described in [28].

For H3 we used the values n1 = n2 = 71, n1b = n2b = 60, n3 = 67, Vcut = 13.06eV

above the minimum of the potential, and r1 min = r2 min = 0.7a0, r1 max = r2 max =

7.1a0, overall resulting in 232 705 gridpoints. The ﬁgures for D3 were n1 = n2 =

49, n1b = n2b = 43, n3 = 67, Vcut = 12.06eV above the minimum of the potential, and

r1 min = r2 min = 0.8a0, r1 max = r2 max = 4.2a0, resulting in 116 192 gridpoints.
The results, which are shown in table 3, have an accuracy of better than 0.25 cm−1
follows from comparison of the A′ and A′′

assuming the PES is correct, which e.g.

components of the E states. Additionally, convergence was ensured by running various

grids of increasing size.

4 Results and Discussion

In Table 1, the ionization limits and quantum defects of ﬁve Rydberg series detected

in a previous investigation from this laboratory [18] are listed. Series 1 and 2 were

observed by ﬁeld-ionization and assigned to d- and s-type Rydberg series, respectively,
converging to a vibrationless D+
3 (N + = 1, K + = 0) state. Series 3 to 5 were found to
arise from autoionizing states which are built on vibrationally excited D+
3 ion cores.
We also observed a Fano type resonance at 29652.6 cm−1 in the continuum above the
ﬁrst ionization limit of the vibrationless 2p 2A′′

2 state. In the present investigation, the

depletion technique is used in order to decide which transitions share a common lower

state, and to determine vibrational frequencies in a straightforward way.

4.1 Depletion measurements of the vibrationless 2p 2A′′

2 state

With the labelling laser set to a member (n=39) of the ﬁeld-ionizing series 1, we ob-
served a depletion dip centered at a frequency of 17333.3 cm−1(Fig. 1a). This transition
was observed in emission by Herzberg’s group and assigned to the 2p 2A′′
2(0,0,0,0) ←
3d 2E′′(0,0,1,0) transition of D3[6]. We describe the rovibrational states by the set
(ν1,ν2,N, G) with the quantum numbers of the symmetric stretch (A′
1) and the degen-
erate mode (E′) vibrations ν1 and ν2, the total angular momentum apart from spin

N , and Hougen’s convenient quantum number G = l + λ − K [29], which contains the

projections of the total (K), the electronic (λ), and the vibrational angular momentum

(l) onto the ﬁgure axis. The depletion feature in Fig. 1a shows clearly that the vibra-
tionless 2p 2A′′
2(0,0,0,0) state is the lower state of Rydberg series 1 and 2. The large
width of 0.8 cm−1 is mainly due to power-broadening . The depletion in the center of

the dip is almost complete which indicates a strong decay mechanism of the upper state
either by predissociation or by radiation into a state diﬀerent from 2p 2A′′

2(0,0,0,0).

We scanned the excitation laser in the tuning range of Coumarin 307, and observed
in a 300 cm−1 wide region a single depletion dip centered at 19629.4 cm−1 (labelling by
n=40 of series 1, Fig.1b). The width of the dip is about 0.2 cm−1 FWHM. The diﬀerence
between the locations of the depletion features shown in Fig.1 is 2296.1 cm−1. This
value is extremely close to the 2300.843 cm−1 symmetric stretch vibrational frequency
of the D+

3 ion [19]. We, therefore, assign the upper state of the transition at 19629.4

6

cm−1 to the vibrationally symmetric stretch excited 3d 2E′′(1,0,1,0) state. The Franck-

Condon factor of this vibrationally non-diagonal transition is quite small. Therefore,
the transition to the 3d 2E′′(1,0,1,0) state (Fig. 1b) is much less power-broadened than
that to the 3d 2E′′(0,0,1,0) state (Fig. 1a). The depletion depth in Fig. 1b is about

half of the ion signal. With the exitation laser (Coumarin 307) unattenuated and the
ionization laser blocked, we observe a strong REMPI peak at 19629.4 cm−1. Both

observations are in line with a comparatively long natural lifetime of the vibrationally
excited 3d 2E′′ state.

With the labelling laser tuned to the peak of the Fano type resonance at 29652.6
cm−1, we observe depletion centered at 19629.4 cm−1(Fig 2a,b). The depth is about half

of the steady ion signal which demonstrates that the Fano type feature is quantitatively

depleted. The measurements presented in Figs. 1 and 2 demonstrate that the lines of

series 1 and 2, the transitions to the vibrationally ground and symmetric stretch excited
3d 2E′′ states at 17333.3 and 19629.4 cm−1, respectively, and the Fano-type peak at
29652.6 cm−1 originate from the vibrationless 2p 2A′′

2(0,0,0,0) metastable state of D3.

These transitions are shown in the level scheme Fig. 7 with the common lower state

labelled by I.

4.2 Depletion measurements of vibrationally excited 2p 2A′′

2 states

The objective is to determine the core excitation of the autoionizing d– and s–Rydberg
states of series 3 and 4 converging to a limit of 29535.1 cm−1, and the d–states of
series 5 converging to 29547.8 cm−1. In Fig. 3, vibrationally diagonal transitions to
autoionizing states in the 27230 cm−1 to 27350 cm−1 and the 27760 cm−1 to 27840
cm−1 energy range are shown. The positions of the n=7 and n=8 lines of series 3 to 5

calculated from the series limits and quantum defects in Table 1 are indicated by the

open circles in Figure 3. As discussed previously [18], the thresholds for vibrational
autoionization of Rydberg states calculated from the molecular constants of D+

3 [19]

are n=8 and n=7 for a core excitation of one quantum in the degenerate and symmetric

stretch mode, respectively. This should allow us to determine the core excitation of the

diﬀerent series from the lowest observed principal quantum number lines. The peaks

F, D and G are the n=8 members of series 3,4, and 5, respectively. In the n=7 range,

the assignment is not unique. Peak B corresponds to n=7 of series 5. Peak A could

7

belong to series 4. The peak C cannot be assigned to any of the series in Table 1.

Therefore, we performed depletion experiments with the labelling laser tuned to the

peaks A to G, and the excitation laser operating with Rhodamine 6G. The results are

presented in Figs. 4 and 5. Labelling the peaks A,B,C, E, and G we found depletion
dips at 17264.5 cm−1. On the other hand, labelling the peaks D and F, we clearly
observed dips at 17270.5 cm−1. We cross-checked and found that the lines D and F

and the lines A,B,C, E, and G are excited from the common lower states II and III,

respectively, as shown in the level scheme Fig. 7 . None of the features in the left part

of Fig. 3 arises from state II. The peaks D and F are the lowest principal quantum

number lines of series 3 and 4 and the autoionization threshold of these series is n=8.

It follows that the ion cores of the Rydberg states of series 3 and 4 and of the common

lower state (II in Fig. 7) are in the ﬁrst degenerate mode excited vibrational state

(ν1=1, ν2=2). The assignment of the peaks A, C, and E in Fig. 3 will be discussed

below.

In the measurement presented in Fig. 6, peak G (n=8 of series 5) was excited by
the labelling laser and the excitation laser was tuned in the 17256 cm−1 to 17285 cm−1

range. In spectrum (a) of Fig. 6, the pulse energy of the excitation laser was 120 µJ.

Spectra (b) and (c) of Fig. 6 were recorded with the excitation laser attenuated by

factors of 10 and 20 respectively using neutral density ﬁlters. We observe two depletion
features at 17264.5 cm−1 and at 17276.1 cm−1 respectively. At high pulse energy of
the excitation laser, the feature at 17264.5 cm−1 is comparatively narrow and in the

center of the dip, the ion signal is almost completely depleted. This feature disappears
at low pulse energy. The dip at 17276.1 cm−1 appears broad and shallow with a width
of about 1 cm−1 FWHM at high pulse energy. At a laser energy as low as 6 µJ, the

depletion of the ion signal is almost complete and the width is reduced by a factor of 3
to about 0.3 cm−1. This shows that the transition moment of the line at 17276.1 cm−1
is by at least one order of magnitude stronger than that of the line at 17264.5 cm−1.

4.3 Symmetric Stretch Frequency of the D3 2p 2A′′

2 State

In the level scheme Fig. 7, the transitions which were found by the depletion technique

to originate from the lower states labelled by I, II, and III are indicated by vertical

lines. As already discussed, state I was identiﬁed to be the vibrationless metastable

8

2(0,0,0,0) . State II was found to be the degenerate mode (E′) excited

state 2p 2A′′
2p 2A′′
2 state. We notice that the diﬀerence between the Fano-type feature at 29652.6
2(0,0,0,0)→3d 2E′′(1,0,1,0) transition at 19629.4 cm−1 is 10023.2
cm−1 and the 2p 2A′′
cm−1. This value is in (almost too) perfect agreement with the diﬀerence between the
transitions at 27299.3 cm−1 (peak B in Fig. 3) and at 17276.1 cm−1 (Fig. 6) both

originating from state III . We do not ﬁnd any other combination diﬀerences between

the observed transitions which would coincide within the experimental accuracy. This

leads us to conclude that the upper states connected by the dashed horizontal lines

in Fig. 7 are identical. As a consequence, the separation between the states I and
III calculated via the 3d 2E′′(1,0,1,0) intermediate state is found to be 2353.3 cm−1.

This value is extremely close to the ﬁrst symmetric stretch vibrational frequency of the
D+

3 ion. We conclude that state III is the symmetric stretch excited 2p 2A′′

2(1,0,0,0)

state. It follows that the previous assignment [18] of series 5 to converge to a symmetric
stretch excited D+

3 state is correct.

In order to assign the peaks A, C, and E we calculated the principal quantum

numbers and quantum defects of all the features in Fig. 3 which were found to have
the symmetric stretch excited 2p 2A′′
29547.8 cm−1 limit of series 5 which converges to a symmetric stretch excited D+

2(1,0,0,0,) state as the lower state. We used the

3 state.

The values are listed in Table 2. The peaks B and G with n=7, δ =0.0143 and n=8,

δ =0.0138 respectively have already been recognized to be d states of series 5 and are

listed for completeness in Table 2. Based on the quantum defect of δ=0.060, peak E is

assigned to the 8s state with symmetric stretch excited core.

The quantum defect δ=0.092 of peak A is signiﬁcantly larger than the typical values
for s–states (c.f. tab. 1) and we have to understand the peak width of 3 cm−1 FWHM

which is appreciably larger than that of the other features in Fig. 3. The peak center
at 27248.7 cm−1 is extremely close to the energy diﬀerence of 27247.7 cm−1 between
the symmetric stretch excited 2p 2A′′
vibrationless 2p 2A′′

2(0,0,0,0) ground state. Transitions between the 2p 2A′′

2(1,0,0,0) state and the ﬁrst ionization limit of the

2(1,0,0,0)

state and the vibrationless s– and d– states of series 1 and 2 are optically allowed, but

the Franck-Condon factors are very small. Feature A could arise from an interference
between the vibrationally diagonal transition from the 2p 2A′′

2(1,0,0,0) state to the

symmetric stretch excited 7s state and non-diagonal transitions to vibrationless high

9

principal quantum number s– and d– states of series 1 and 2.

Based on the quantum defect of δ=-0.002, peak C was explained in a previous

study [18] by an interloper of a g–series with symmetric stretch excited core. Another

explanation is a vibrationally non-diagonal transition to a 5s (2,0,1,0) state with two

quanta of excitation in the symmetric stretch mode. The series limit listed in Table 2
was calculated from the molecular constants of D+

3 determined by Amano et al.

[19].

The quantum defect of δ=0.0566 is in line with the values generally observed for low

principal quantum number s–states.

4.4 Comparison between Experimental and Theoretical Results

In Table 3, the energies of the lowest vibrational states of H3 2p 2A′′

2 and D3 2p 2A′′
2

determined by theoretical and experimental investigations are listed. The values are

given relative to the vibrationless states. The theoretical data are calculated from

the ab initio potential energy surface by Peng et al.[2] using the procedure described
in Section 3. For comparison, the vibrational frequencies of the H+

3 and D+

3 ions

determined by Majewski et al.

[30] and by Amano et al.

[19] are included in Table

3. The diﬀerences between the vibrational frequencies of the neutrals and the ions are
quite large which shows the valence character of the 2p 2A′′
2 state. The use of ab initio

potential energy surfaces is mandatory in order to calculate the vibrational levels to a

satisfactory accuracy. A treatment based on a quantum defect, which is independent

of the nuclear coordinates, is condemned to fail. The experimental results for D3 were

measured in this and in a previous investigation from this laboratory [18], and the
[14]. The value of 3255.4 cm−1 for the

data for H3 were taken from Ketterle et al.
symmetric stretch frequency of the H3 2p 2A′′
2 state measured by Lembo and Helm
[16] is in close agreement with the value of 3255.38 cm−1 measured by Ketterle et al.
[14]. The uncertainties of the experimental data which are estimated to be ±0.3 cm−1
for D3 and ±0.1 cm−1 for H3, are generally much smaller than the diﬀerences between
experiment and theory which are of the order of a few cm−1, the largest being 6.6 cm−1
in case of the E′– vibration of H3 2p 2A′′

2. As discussed above, the numerical procedure

for the calculation of the eigenvalues is converged to an accuracy better than 0.25
cm−1. Therefore, the diﬀerences between experiment and theory must be attributed
to the potential energy surface which was ﬁtted to the ab initio points with an average

10

deviation of 5 cm−1 and a root mean square deviation of 170 cm−1 [2]. The shape of

the ﬁtted PES in the region occupied by the low vibrational states is apparently quite

good. The observed diﬀerences between the vibrational frequencies of the neutrals and

the ions are in very good agreement with the theoretical data as visualized in Fig.
8 where we present the diﬀerences between the vibrational frequencies of the 2p 2A′′
2

states and those of the corresponding ions, normalized to the frequencies of the ions for
easier comparison. The measured symmetric stretch frequencies of the 2p 2A′′
of D3 and H3 are roughly 2 % higher than those of the D+

3 ions, respectively,

3 and H+

2 states

which is very well reproduced by the calculated data. In the case of the degenerate

mode vibration, the relative diﬀerences between neutrals and ions are almost twice

as large. This additional resistance against asymmetric deformation induced by the

2pz–electron is explained by the theoretical data, although the total eﬀect is slightly

underestimated.

5 Conclusions

We investigated the vibrational frequencies of the 2p 2A′′
2 metastable state and the
3d 2E′′ state of the triatomic deuterium molecule D3 by a depletion type double reso-
nance technique. We found a separation of 2296.1 cm−1 between the vibrationless D3
3d 2E′′(0,0,1,0) and the symmetric stretch excited 3d 2E′′(1,0,1,0) state. The 2353.3
cm−1 symmetric stretch frequency of the 2p 2A′′

2 state determined in a previous inves-

tigation from this laboratory was conﬁrmed. We compared the experimental results of
the 2p 2A′′
2 state of D3 and H3 with theoretical data calculated from an ab initio po-

tential energy surface. The theoretical data describe very well the diﬀerences between

the vibrational frequencies of the ions and the neutrals which demonstrates the quality

of the ab initio potential energy surface.

Figure 1: Depletion spectra of metastable D3 molecules. The labelling laser was

set to excite the n=39 (a) and n=40 (b) lines of the ﬁeld-ionizing Rydberg series 1,
respectively. The excitation laser was scanned between 17329 cm−1 and 17339.5 cm−1
17
(part a) in the tuning range of Rhodamine 6G, and between 19623 cm−1 and 19635
cm−1 in the tuning range of Coumarin 307 (part b).

Figure 6: Depletion spectra with the labelling laser tuned to peak G of ﬁg. 3. The
excitation laser was scanned in the 17255 to 17285 cm−1 spectral range. In spectrum a,
22
the pulse energy of the excitation laser was 120 µJ. In the spectra b and c, the excitation

laser was attenuated by factors of 10 and 20 respectively using neutral density ﬁlters.

The ion signal was normalized. For clarity of presentation, the curves are shifted

Figure 7:

Level scheme containing states and transitions investigated by depletion

spectroscopy in this paper. The vibrational levels are labelled by the quantum num-

23
bers (ν1,ν2). The ionization limits of series 1 to 5 (see Table 1) are indicated by the thin

vertical lines. The pumped transitions are shown by thick vertical lines with arrow-

heads. Transitions in the ultraviolet range were used for labelling, those in the visible

spectral range for depletion.

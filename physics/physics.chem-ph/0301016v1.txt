The adiabatic connection curve of density functional theory (DFT) is accurately calculated
beyond the physical interaction strength for Hooke’s atom, two interacting electrons in a har-
monic well potential. Extrapolation of the accurate curve to the inﬁnite coupling limit agrees
well with the strictly correlated electron (SCE) hypothesis but the approach to this limit is
more complex. The interaction strength interpolation is shown to be a good, but not perfect,
ﬁt to the adiabatic curve. Arguments about the locality of functionals and convexity of the
adiabatic connection curve are examined in this regime.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Density functional theory (DFT) is a popular com-
putational method in solid state physics and quantum
chemistry since it is both simple and reliable [1–3]. Be-
cause of its wide range of applications and its ability
to handle large systems, there is considerable interest
in DFT and improving its accuracy. In DFT, the only
part of the total energy to approximate is the exchange-
correlation energy functional, EXC[n]. A formal and gen-
eral expression for the exchange-correlation energy is ac-
cording to the adiabatic connection [4],

EXC[n] =

dλ UXC[n](λ).

(1)

Z

where UXC[n](λ) is the exchange-correlation potential en-
ergy of a density, n, at coupling constant, λ. Analysis of
the integrand, UXC[n](λ), leads to many exact relation-
ships that the exact exchange-correlation energy satisﬁes
and approximate functionals should satisfy. For example,
G¨orling and Levy obtained a perturbation series expres-
sion for the exchange-correlation energy [5] by expanding
about the weak interaction limit. Another fruitful result
is the understanding of why hybrid functionals like PBE0
[6] and B3LYP [7] perform so well [8–10].

Because the exchange-correlation energy is the area un-
der the adiabatic connection curve between λ = 0 to 1,
the most interest in UXC(λ) has been conﬁned to this do-
main. However, there is no fundamental reason to restrict
study to this domain. In fact, certain exact properties of
the adiabatic connection curve outside this domain have

→ ∞

been used to better approximate the curve [11]. One ex-
ample is the consideration of the strong interaction limit,
λ
. A model for this strongly interacting limit is
the strictly correlated electron (SCE) hypothesis [12, 13]
which states that, because of the strong Coulomb repul-
sion, the individual electrons distribute themselves as far
apart as possible but are constrained to yield a given
density. Finding one electron uniquely pins the others
into position. Among other predictions, this SCE model
says that UXC can also be expanded about the strong
interaction strength limit (λ
Information from
this inﬁnite limit combined with the G¨orling-Levy ex-
pansion about λ = 0 leads to the suggestion of the inter-
action strength interpolation (ISI) for the entire curve.
Exchange-correlation energies from the ISI are consider-
ably more accurate than those using only the ﬁrst two
terms in the perturbation series [14].

→ ∞

).

Another reason to consider large coupling strengths is
that approximate exchange-correlation energy function-
als for this limit might be more accurate[15]. It has long
been known that standard approximate density function-
als, such as the local density approximation (LDA) or
the PBE generalized gradient approximation (GGA), are
better for exchange-correlation together than they are for
exchange alone. This is due to a cancellation of errors
between approximations to the exchange and correlation
energy [10, 16].
If this cancellation between exchange
and correlation grows with larger coupling constants, ap-
proximate density functionals in this regime will be more
accurate.

The present work is a detailed study of some of these
suggestions. We employ a procedure developed for the
range λ = 0 to 1 [17] and extend the simulated adiabatic

connection curve to larger coupling constants. At some
point along the adiabatic connection curve, the simulat-
ing scaling method is expected to break down. Never-
theless, the curve can be extrapolated from there to the
inﬁnite coupling limit. This analysis yields interesting
new information about the strong interaction limit.

We work with Hooke’s atom because it remains bound
no matter now strongly the electrons interact. Hooke’s
atom is the unpolarized two electron system described by
the Hamiltonian [? ] ,

an exactly solvable model with Coulomb interactions but
also an important physical system. For example, many
authors have used this system to model quantum dots
[19, 20].

Although we could have performed calculations for the
Hooke’s atom at various harmonic well strengths, we will
focus on k = 1/4. For this spring constant, the Hooke’s
atom happens to admit an analytic solution [21]. Fur-
thermore, for this k value, the correlation energy is com-
parable to that of the Helium atom.

The simulated curves indicate that the SCE predic-
tions for UXC(
) are correct. Next, assuming the valid-
ity of the SCE hypothesis, we generate a highly accurate
simulation of the entire curve. This allows us to calculate
higher derivatives of UXC(λ) around key points: λ = 0, 1,
and
. This information should be useful for the testing
and improvement of existing functionals. We also com-
pare the interaction strength interpolation (ISI) with the
accurate simulated result.

II. ADIABATIC CONNECTION THEORY

Three theoretical elements are vital to the content of
this paper. These are the adiabatic connection curve, the
strong coupling limit, and the relationship between scale
factor and coupling constant.

First, we review the adiabatic connection formalism.

yields the density n(r). The functional, UXC[n](λ), as a
function of λ makes up the adiabatic connection curve.
At λ = 0, Eq. 3 is just EX, the exchange energy evaluated
at a given density. Later for convenience, we will subtract
this contribution and write UC(λ) = UXC(λ)

EX.

integrate from λ = 0 to 1. Unfortunately, there is no
guarantee that the higher order terms will be negligible
and that the series will converge [14].

Other exact properties of UXC might be useful to help

understand this curve. An interesting limit is when λ

∞
strong coupling limit. This limit corresponds to strongly
interacting electrons which still yield the physical density.
In this limit, the integrand is ﬁnite [13]. We can expand
UXC(λ) about the inﬁnite limit:

terms in the expansion. It has been suggested that the
electrons behave in a strictly correlated manner at this
limit [13]. The electrons still produce a given density
distribution, but ﬁnding one electron determines the po-
sition of all the others. Information about this limit can
be incorporated into an interpolation formula which re-
produces both limits exactly and can be integrated ana-
lytically. An example is the Interaction Strength Inter-
polation (ISI) [14].

For spherically symmetric two-electron systems in
three dimensions, the SCE model admits an exact so-

large the missing contribution to U ′

calculated the SCE limit and part of the ﬁrst correction
term for the Hooke’s atom k = 1/4 according to the for-
mulae given by Seidl in Ref. [13].

The ﬁnal point, the relationship between coupling con-

used to simulate the adiabatic connection curve. A den-

with γ being the scale factor. The exchange-correlation

Hooke’s atom at k = 1/4. Then, we solve at various
other coupling constants and use the simulated scaling
to return us as closely as possible to the k = 1/4 density.

III. SIMULATED SCALING METHOD

In order to generate highly accurate adiabatic connec-
tion plots, we use the procedure developed by Frydel,
Terilla, and Burke [17]. To ﬁnd the adiabatic connec-
tion curve, we need Eλ
XC[n] for a set of λ’s. For Hooke’s
atom, we know the exact densities and the exact EXC at
diﬀerent k values. Instead of changing λ, which is dif-
ﬁcult, we use Eq. (7). A small change in the strength
of external potential yields another density, qualitatively
similar to the original density but on a diﬀerent scale. If
we can solve the system exactly at this diﬀerent exter-
nal potential strength, we have an approximation to the
exchange-correlation energy with a scaled density. For
densities that do not qualitatively change shape much,
this scheme is highly accurate.
To ﬁnd UXC(λ), we
diﬀerentiate Eq. (7) with this highly accurate approx-
imation to the exact EXC[n1/λ]. Including a ﬁrst order
correction term increases the accuracy of this method:

where vC(r) = δEC[n]/δn(r) is the correlation contri-
bution to the Kohn-Sham potential. The method gives
highly accurate energies for Hooke’s atom (k = 1/4) and
for Helium when λ varies from 0 to 1. The error at λ = 0
is 0.3 mHartrees, and the estimated error for λ close to
one less than 1 mHartree [17].

For each simulated scaling, we must assign an appro-
priate scale factor, but which true scaled density does the
approximately scaled density mimic? The original paper
discusses several possibilities. They all require knowing
how a chosen component of the energy changes with uni-
form density scaling. We use the EX method:

λ = 1/γ = EX[n]/EX[n

In this paper, we examine the adiabatic connection
curve at large interaction strengths. This method only
works for λ > 1 for systems that remain bound as the ex-
ternal potential is weakened. Even with this restriction,
the method must ultimately fail as λ
. Speciﬁcally
for Hooke’s atom, Cioslowski showed that at a certain
critical strength for the external potential, kc = 0.0016
(λc = 4.138), the density changes shape qualitatively
[25]. Beyond this value, the simulated scaling might no
longer be a good approximation to exact scaling. On
the other hand, the method fails for He almost immedi-
ately as the two electron ion unbinds at nuclear charge,
Z = 0.9.

imate functional. A generalized gradient approximation
(GGA) mimics the complexity of the true functional bet-
ter than, say, the local density approximation. Because
of its ﬁrst principle derivation and reliability, we use PBE
here [26]. Since we have the analytic form for the PBE
functional, we can scale the input density to generate the
entire adiabatic curve, Fig. 2. The curve is shown as a
function of µ = 1/√λ so that the region λ

We need a criterion for how far along the adiabatic
connection we can trust the simulated density scaling to
mimic the exactly scaled density. Our criterion is to ter-
minate the simulations at µ = µc = 1/√λc where the
density qualitatively changes shape [25]. Even at this
point, the ﬁrst order correction in Eq. (9) still improves
upon the zeroth order simulation. This is a highly con-
servative estimate; it is likely that the curves are accurate
to smaller µ’s.

To get a prediction for UC(µ = 0), we must extrapolate
the simulation to µ = 0. This is done by ﬁtting the simu-
lated data to an nth order polynomial and extrapolating
this polynomial to µ = 0. The third order polynomial
connecting four sample points best reproduces the known
U P BE
). In Fig. 2, we show the exactly scaled PBE
functional and the polynomial interpolation. We see that
the simulated curve is almost on top of the exact curve.
However, they do diﬀer slightly in the UC(µ = 0) values.

The simulated adiabatic connection curve for Hooke’s
atom k = 1/4 in Fig. (3) approaches the SCE UC(µ = 0)
limit. As in section III for the PBE functional, we re-
produce the entire curve by ﬁtting the simulated points
to a third order polynomial. Since the simulated scaling
method is only reliable between µc = 1/2 and 1, we must
extrapolate the curve over the domain µ = 0 to 1/2 by a
polynomial. The extrapolated prediction for UC(µ = 0),
0.206, is 22 mHartrees from the strictly correlated elec-

V. SIMULATING THE ENTIRE ADIABATIC
CONNECTION CURVE

In section IV, we used an extrapolation scheme to com-
plete the adiabatic curve. Here, we combine the sim-
ulated part with the SCE electron limit to produce a
highly accurate adiabatic connection curve for all cou-
pling strengths. From this curve, we calculate the ﬁrst
terms in Taylor expansions about both λ = 0 and 1, and
µ = 0 and 1. Using these new results, we assess the accu-
racy of the Interaction Strength Interpolation (ISI) with
accurate inputs.

The µ < 1 simulated adiabatic connection curve is
shown in Fig. 4. The curve was generated by ﬁtting the
simulated data points from µ = 0.5 to 1 and including the
SCE UC(µ = 0) in the point set. We used a third order
polynomial, the order that best reproduced the adiabatic
curve for the PBE functional in section III. This curve
should be an excellent approximation to the exact curve.
From the plot, we see that the derivative dUC(µ)/dµ is
positive everywhere along the adiabatic curve. This im-
plies that dUC(λ)/dλ is negative, and the adiabatic curve
is convex. All calculated UC(λ) curves for 0
1 have
dUC(λ)/dλ < 0, but the inequality has never been gener-
1
ally proven. Our result extends this observation to λ
for this system.

The interaction strength interpolation (ISI), as origi-
nally formulated [14], is an interpolation scheme for the
entire adiabatic connection curve. It used exact values
at λ = 0 and carefully chosen GGA values at µ = 0. We
now ask how well the ISI with accurate inputs compares
to the simulated curve. The answer tells us how good
the choice of curve in the ISI is. For the inputs to the
ISI, we use the exact EX and EGL2
which are derivable
C
from the simulated curves in Ref.
[17] and are given in
Table IV. For UXC(
), we use the SCE prediction which
judging from the results in section IV, we believe to be
exact. For U ′
C(µ = 0), we input two diﬀerent values. the
accurate simulated value and Seidel’s prediction. The re-
sults are shown in table V. The ISI interpolation does
not perform exceptionally well with accurate inputs as
already noticed in [11]. For example, the magnitude of
UXC(1) is underestimated by 5 mHartrees. This is per-
haps a result of the way the U ′
C(µ = 0) limit is included
in the interpolation equation. For this system, incorpo-
rating the accurate value for U ′
C(µ = 0) in the ISI does
not greatly improve its accuracy.

In Fig. 5, we see how the PBE and LDA adiabatic
connection curves compare to the accurate curve. The
PBE curve clearly crosses the accurate curve. Since

X
the LDA curve must cross the accurate one at some larger
interaction strength. Since both curves cross the exact
curve at some λ > 1, the cancellation of errors between
exchange and correlation in Eλ
XC will grow smaller be-
yond some critical interaction strength and become an
addition of errors. It has been argued that because the
exchange correlation on-top hole grows more local as the
interaction strength increases [10, 27], local functionals
for Eλ
XC would work better as λ increases. This is cer-
tainly true for our system in the range, 0
1; how-
ever, the adiabatic plots indicate that as λ grows, the
energy depends on the density in an increasingly nonlo-
cal way. The accuracy of the on-top hole is less relevant
to the total energies in the strongly interacting region of
the adiabatic connection curve.

and performed an extrapolation to the strong interaction
limit. This simulated curve agreed with the SCE hypoth-
esis. To generate a highly accurate curve for µ = 0 to
1, we included the SCE UC(µ = 0) in the set of points
and interpolated. Using this accurate adiabatic curve,
we found higher derivatives at key coupling constants:
λ = 0,1, and
. Finally, we compared some popular
approximate functionals to the accurate curve. These re-
sults will be useful in the formal analysis of the adiabatic
connection curve, the testing of approximate functionals,
and the construction of new functionals in DFT.

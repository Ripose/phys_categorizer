Abstract

The energetics of the gas-phase SN 2 reactions Y− + CH3X −→ CH3Y +

X− (where X,Y = F, Cl, Br), were studied using (variants on) the recent

W1 and W2 ab initio computational thermochemistry methods. These cal-

culations involve CCSD and CCSD(T) coupled cluster methods, basis sets of

up to spdf gh quality, extrapolations to the one-particle basis set limit, and

contributions of inner-shell correlation, scalar relativistic eﬀects, and (where

relevant) ﬁrst-order spin-orbit coupling. Our computational predictions are

in excellent agreement with experimental data where these have small error

bars; in a number of other instances re-examination of the experimental data

may be in order. Our computed benchmark data (including cases for which

experimental data are unavailable altogether) are used to assess the quality of

a number of semiempirical compound thermochemistry schemes such as G2

theory, G3 theory, and CBS-QB3, as well as a variety of density functional

theory methods. Upon applying some modiﬁcations to the level of theory

used for the reference geometry (adding diﬀuse functions, replacing B3LYP

by the very recently proposed mPW1K functional [Lynch, B.J.; Fast, P.L.;

Harris, M.; Truhlar, D.G. J. Phys. Chem. A 2000, 104, 4811]), the com-

pound methods appear to perform well. Only the ’half-and-half’ functionals

BH&HLYP and mPWH&HPW91, and the empirical mPW1K functional, con-

sistently ﬁnd all required stationary points; the other functionals fail to ﬁnd

a transition state in the F/Br case. BH&HLYP and mPWH&HPW91 some-

what overcorrect for the tendency of B3LYP (and, to a somewhat lesser extent,

mPW1PW91) to underestimate barrier heights. The Becke97 and Becke97-1

functionals perform similarly to B3LYP for the problem under study, while the

HCTH and HCTH-120 functionals both appear to underestimate central bar-

riers. HCTH underestimates complexation energies; this problem is resolved

in HCTH-120. mPW1K appears to exhibit the best performance of the func-

tionals considered, although its energetics are still inferior to the compound

thermochemistry methods. mPW1K, however, appears to be very suitable for

generating reference geometries for more elaborate thermochemical methods

in kinetics applications.

I. INTRODUCTION

Due to the central importance of bimolecular nucleophilic substitution (SN 2) reactions

in organic chemistry,1,2 the prototype SN 2 reactions

Y− + CH3X −→ CH3Y + X−

(X, Y = F, Cl, and Br)

(1)

have aroused considerable interest in the past three decades.

(Halomethanes have also

received considerable attention in the area of atmospheric chemistry in connection with

global warming3 and ozone layer destruction.4) Both theoretical and experimental studies

(see Refs.5,6 for reviews) indicate that the preferred gas phase reaction pathway involves a

backside attack of the halide ion, Y−, at the carbon atom followed by the familiar ‘Walden

inversion’ of the CH3 group. The resulting reaction proﬁle (Figure 1) exhibits two local

minima, i.e. entry and exit channel ion-molecule complexes Y−· · ·CH3X and YCH3· · ·X−,

connected by a central transition state [Y· · ·CH3· · ·X]−, which has D3h and C3v symmetries

in the identity (X=Y) and nonidentity (X6=Y) cases, respectively. Although the qualitative

form of this reaction pathway is widely accepted for substitution reactions in the gas phase,

there is still considerable uncertainty about the exact energetics.

B¨ohme et al.7 and Brauman et al.8 were the ﬁrst to investigate the gas-phase SN 2 re-

actions experimentally. Brauman and coworkers concluded that the measurements were

best explained by a double-well potential with a central barrier. Subsequent experimental
studies9–12 for a series of anionic nucleophiles with alkyl halides revealed that changes in

the nucleophile, leaving group, and alkyl moiety leads to a wide variation of reaction rate

constants; their observed variation was attributed to the central barrier height.

The double-well SN 2 potential energy surface also ﬁnds abundant theoretical support

from ab initio calculations, which are currently one of the most useful tools for evaluating

reaction potential energy proﬁles. For instance, Chandrasekhar et al.13 presented a compre-

hensive examination of Cl/Cl identity SN 2 reaction at the HF/6-31G* level, and Tucker and

Truhlar14 examined the SN 2 reactions at the MP2/6-31G* level. Wladkowski et al.15 studied

the F/F identity SN 2 reaction by large-scale coupled cluster theory involving single and dou-

ble excitation operators with an a posteriori a quasiperturbative treatment of the eﬀects of

3

connected triple substitutions (CCSD(T)) (see Refs.16,17 for reviews). Later, Radom, Pross

and coworkers have carried out ab initio molecular orbital calculations at the G2(+) level

of theory for the back-side identity18 and nonidentity19 SN 2 reactions. These authors have

also investigated the identity front-side SN 2 reactions with retention of conﬁguration.20 The

G2(+) theory is essentially G2 theory carried out from MP2/6-31+G* (rather than MP2/6-

31G*) geometries and employing scaled HF/6-31+G* (rather than HF/6-31G*) zero-point

energies. For the bromine and iodine containing systems, these authors employed Hay-

Wadt21 relativistic eﬀective core potentials (RECPs). Botschwina and coworkers examined

the stationary points of the potential surface for the F/Cl nonidentity SN 2 reaction22 and

for the Cl/Cl identity SN 2 reaction23 by means of large-scale CCSD(T) calculations. Finally,

a referee brought a very recent large-scale coupled cluster study by Schmatz et al.24 to our

attention.

Despite the well known successes (e.g.25,26) of the increasingly popular DFT (density

functional theory) methods,27 their performance for transition state structures and reac-

tion barrier heights leaves something to be desired. For instance, Durant28 found that the

B3LYP, B3P86 and B3PW91 functionals all systematically underestimated barrier heights,

while only the Becke half-and-half/Lee, Yang and Parr (BH&HLYP)29 functional predicted

transition state barrier heights reasonably well — despite the fact that its performance for

thermochemical and other properties is generally substantially poorer than that of B3LYP

and B3PW91. Baker et al.30 arrived at a similar conclusion stating that the currently avail-

able density functionals are unable to provide a correct description of the transition states.

For the prototype SN 2 reactions (Cl/Cl and Cl/Br) considered here, Radom and coworkers31

found that the popular B3LYP32,33 exchange-correlation functional signiﬁcantly underes-

timated the overall and central barrier heights compared to the G2(+) and experimental

results.

Nevertheless, the size of the systems involved in kinetic and mechanistic problems of

organic and organometallic interest often makes DFT the only practical option. As a mat-

ter of fact, our group has recently reported DFT studies of the mechanism of competitive

intramolecular C-C and C-H bond activation in rhodium(I) pincer complexes34 and of the

4

Heck reaction.35

Aside from BH&HLYP, better performance for barrier heights has been claimed for a

number of newer exchange-correlation functionals. For example, Adamo and Barone36 found

that their mPW1PW91 (modiﬁed Perdew-Wang 1991 1-parameter hybrid exchange with

Perdew-Wang 1991 correlation37) at least correctly predicts a positive overall barrier for the

Cl/Cl identity SN 2 reaction, although it is still being underestimated. Very recently, Truhlar

and coworkers38 proposed a new hybrid model called the modiﬁed Perdew-Wang 1-parameter

model for kinetics (mPW1K). In this empirical functional, the coeﬃcient X for admixture

of ”exact” Hartree-Fock exchange

VXC = XVX,HF + (1 − X)VX,mP W 1 + VC,P W 91

(2)

(where X=1/4 for standard mPW1PW91) was determined (using the fairly small 6-31+G*

basis set) by minimizing the average deviation from a set of 40 barrier heights (20 forward,

20 reverse) obtained from a combination of experiment and theory (see Ref.38 for details).

(Note that the Walden inversion, or for that matter cationic or anionic reactions of any

kind, were not part of the parametrization set.) It was found that mPW1K reduced the

mean unsigned error in reaction barrier heights by a factor of 2.4 over mPW1PW91 and by

a factor of 3 over B3LYP.

Theoretical models such as Transition State Theory (TST)39 and Rice-Ramsperger-

Kassel-Marcus (RRKM)40 theory were also employed to examine the SN 2 reactions. Results

from such studies (see41 and references therein) suggested that the assumption of statistical

behavior in ion-molecule intermediate complexes is not valid. This ”nonstatistical” behavior

has been documented for several halide-methyl halide reactions and a thorough discussion

is given by Hase.5 Classical trajectory simulations performed by Hase and coworkers42 ques-

tioned the basic assumptions of statistical theories and found that the trajectory calculations

are very useful in interpreting the kinetics and dynamics of SN 2 reactions.

Despite the enormous amount of work in the past, there are still signiﬁcant gaps in

the experimental data for the gas-phase SN 2 reactions and, even where data are available,

the results often possess large uncertainties. Recently, two computational thermochemistry

5

methods known as W1 and W2 (Weizmann-1 and Weizmann-2) theory43 have been developed

in our laboratory. These are free of parameters derived from experiment and on average

can claim ‘benchmark accuracy’ (deﬁned in Ref.43 as a mean absolute error of 1 kJ/mol,

or 0.25 kcal/mol) for molecular total atomization energies (TAEs) of ﬁrst-and second-row

compounds. The primary objective of the present study is to obtain high-quality energetic

data for reaction (1) by means of W1 and W2 theory. Using these benchmark data, we

shall then examine the performance of various DFT methods and ab initio computational

thermochemistry methods such as G1,44 G2,45 G3,46 and CBS-QB347 theories.

II. COMPUTATIONAL METHODS

All calculations were carried out on the 4-processor Compaq ES40 of our research group,

and on the 12-CPU SGI Origin 2000 of the Faculty of Chemistry.

Energetics for the gas-phase stationary points for all six surfaces (i.e. F/F, Cl/Cl, Br/Br,

F/Cl, F/Br, and Cl/Br) were obtained by means of the W1′ method described in Refs.43,48.

The W1′ method48 is a minor variation on W1 theory43 that exhibits improved accuracy

for second-row systems at no additional computational cost. For a detailed description and

theoretical and empirical arguments for each step, see Ref.43; we shall merely summarize

the main points here for the sake of clarity. The basis sets employed are mostly Dunning’s
augmented correlation consistent n-tuple zeta49–51 (aug-cc-pVnZ) basis sets; for second-row

atoms high-exponent d and f functions were added (denoted ’+2d’ or ’+2d1f’) as recom-

mended in Ref.52 for accommodating inner polarization. Since the standard aug-cc-pVnZ

basis sets for bromine53 already contain quite high-exponent d functions in order to describe

the 3d orbitals, no ’inner polarization’ functions were deemed to be necessary on Br. We

may distinguish the following six components in the ‘bottom-of-the-well’ TAE at the W1′

level:

• The SCF component of the TAE is obtained using the aug-cc-pVDZ+2d, aug-cc-

pVTZ+2d, and aug-cc-pVQZ+2d1f basis sets, and extrapolated to the inﬁnite-basis

limit using the geometric expression54 A + B · C −L, where the ‘cardinal number’

6

L={2,3,4} for these three basis sets.

(It is identical to the maximum angular mo-

mentum present for nonhydrogen atoms. Regular cc-pVnZ basis sets were used on

hydrogen atoms throughout.)

• The CCSD (coupled cluster with all singles and doubles55) valence correlation contri-

bution to TAE is obtained using the aug-cc-pVTZ+2d and aug-cc-pVQZ+2d1f basis

sets, then extrapolated to the inﬁnite basis limit using the expression A + B/L3.22.

• The (T) connected triple excitations component56 of TAE was computed using the aug-

cc-pVDZ+2d and aug-cc-pVTZ+2d basis sets, and extrapolated to the inﬁnite basis

limit using the expression A + B/L3.22.

• The inner-shell correlation contribution was computed as the diﬀerence between

CCSD(T)/MTsmall43 values with and without constraining the inner-shell orbitals

to be doubly occupied. The very deep-lying chlorine (1s) and bromine (1s,2s,2p) or-

bitals were doubly occupied throughout; the ‘inner-shell correlation’ thus represents

carbon (1s), chlorine (2s,2p) and bromine (3s,3p,3d) correlation. (Basis set superposi-

tion error, BSSE, can be an issue for inner-shell correlation energies in heavier element

systems;57 our experience43 suggests that BSSE in the W1/W2 inner shell correlation

contributions largely cancels with basis set incompleteness.)

• The scalar relativistic contribution was computed as expectation values of the one-

electron Darwin and mass-velocity (DMV) operators58,59 for the ACPF/MTsmall (av-

eraged coupled pair functional60) wave function, with all inner-shell electrons correlated

except for chlorine (1s) and bromine (1s,2s,2p).

• The spin-orbit contribution to TAE, in the present case of all-closed-shell systems, is

nothing more than the sum of the atomic ﬁne structure corrections.

Where our computational hardware permitted (in practice, for F/F, Cl/Cl, and the

Br/Br transition state), we also carried out even more demanding W2h calculations. In W2

theory, the same steps occur as above, except that the three valence basis sets are aug-cc-

pVTZ+2d1f, aug-cc-pVQZ+2d1f, and aug-cc-pV5Z+2d1f (with L=3,4, and 5, respectively)

7

and that the extrapolation formula61 used for the CCSD and (T) steps is simply A + B/L3.

The W2h variant62 indicates, in this particular case, the use of unaugmented cc-pVnZ basis

sets on carbon. The largest basis set CCSD step was carried out using the direct algorithm of

Lindh, Sch¨utz, and Werner.63 All these calculations were performed using MOLPRO 98.164

and a driver for the W1/W2 calculations65 written in MOLPRO’s scripting language. Ref-

erence geometries were obtained primarily using the B3LYP32,33 density functional method,

which employs the Lee-Yang-Parr33 correlation functional in conjugation with a hybrid ex-

change functional ﬁrst proposed by Becke.32

A number of lower-level procedures were validated against the W1′ and W2h re-

sults. These include the following set of DFT exchange-correlation functionals and ba-

sis sets: B3LYP/cc-pVTZ(+X), BH&HLYP/cc-pVTZ(+X), mPW1PW91/cc-pVTZ(+X),

mPW1K/6-31+G*, mPW1K/cc-pVDZ(+X), mPW1K/cc-pVTZ(+X), where (+X) indicates

that diﬀuse functions are included only for halogens. BH&HLYP29 is essentially the B3LYP

method, with the exception that the fraction of HF exchange is 50% (H&H denotes ”half and

half”). Analogous to BH&HLYP, we have also performed mPWH&HPW91.66 In addition, we

carried out calculations using the standard G1, G2, G3, and CBS-QB3 model chemistries.

The MP2/6-31G* and B3LYP/6-311G(2d,d,p) levels of theory (used for the reference ge-

ometries in G346 and CBS-QB3,47 respectively) fail to ﬁnd stationary points for several of

the ion-molecule complexes in the nonidentity cases (because of the absence of diﬀuse func-
tions). Therefore, we have deﬁned, by analogy with Radom and coworkers,18–20 G3(+) and

CBS-QB3(+) model chemistries where MP2/6-31+G* and B3LYP/6-311+G(2d,d,p) refer-

ence geometries, respectively, are used. The G2(+) results quoted in the tables are taken

from Radom and coworkers.18,19 All of these calculations were carried out using Gaussian 98

rev. A767 or trivial modiﬁcations thereof. Following the recommendations in Ref.68, larger

grids than the default were used in the DFT calculations if necessary, speciﬁcally a pruned

(99,590) grid for integration and gradients, and a pruned (50,194) grid for the solution of

the coupled perturbed Kohn-Sham equations.

Finally, following very recent suggestions in the literature69 that some of these function-

als may perform better for transition states, some calculations using the novel B97 (Becke-

8

1997),70 B97-1 (reparametrized Becke-1997),71 HCTH (Hamprecht-Cohen-Tozer-Handy),71

and HCTH-120 (reparametrization of HCTH including anions and weakly interacting

systems)72 functionals were carried out by means of a slightly modiﬁed version of NWCHEM

3.3.1.73

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

A. Reference Geometries

Reference geometries for the W1′ calculations were mostly obtained at the B3LYP/cc-

pVTZ+1 level, where the ‘+1’ signiﬁes the addition of a high-exponent d function on second-

row elements.74 (The Br basis set already includes high-exponent d functions to cover the (3d)

orbital.) It was previously shown26 that B3LYP/cc-pVTZ geometries for stable molecules

are generally within a few thousandths of an ˚A from experiment, as well that the use of

B3LYP/cc-pVTZ+1 rather than much costlier CCSD(T)/cc-pVQZ+1 reference geometries

insigniﬁcantly aﬀects computed energies.43 (Modiﬁcations of popular computational ther-

mochemistry methods that use DFT reference geometries include variants75,76 of G2 theory,

G3//B3LYP,77 and CBS-QB3.47) In some cases where B3LYP fails to locate the required

stationary point, we used mPW1K/cc-pVTZ(+X) reference geometries. For the W2h cal-

culations, CCSD(T)/cc-pVQZ+1 reference geometries were used. The geometries of all the

structures involved in the present study calculated at various levels of theory are provided

in the Supplementary Material.

B. Energetics

In order to assess the accuracy of W1′ and W2h results, we consider ﬁrst the total

atomization energies (TAEs) of CH3X and electron aﬃnities (EAs) of X−. A summary of

our computed results and their components for the reactants/products of the SN 2 reactions is

presented in Table 1. The ﬁnal energies presented in the last column of the Table correspond

to EAs of X (X = F, Cl and Br) and TAEs without zero-point vibrational energy (ZPVE)

9

of CH3X. The inner-shell correlation contributions are all positive and the largest is 1.49

kcal/mol for CH3Br. The core correlation contribution for TAE(CH3X) is found to increase

in the order F < Cl < Br, while for EA(X) it increases in the order Cl < F < Br. The

importance of Darwin and mass-velocity corrections increases, as expected, with increasing

atomic number (Z) of X and its contribution becomes substantial when X = Br.

It is perhaps more pertinent for our purposes to examine the relative energies (with

respect to reactants) of the ion-molecule complexes and transition state structures. Table

2 presents W1′ and W2h results for identity reactions and only W1′ results for nonidentity

reactions. W2h calculations for the nonidentity reactions are extremely expensive as the

reaction intermediates are less symmetric. Moreover, the size of the bromine atoms prevents

us from performing a W2h calculation on the identity Br−· · ·CH3Br ion-molecule complex.

Likewise, we could not obtain the core correlation contributions for the Br−· · ·CH3Br ion-

molecule complex at the W1′ level of theory. It was previously established78 that the inclusion

of connected triple excitations in CCSD(T) is absolutely necessary for reliable core correlation

contributions: the n3N 4 CPU time dependence of the (T) step dominates the required CPU

time for Cl and Br. Both the size of the halogen atoms and the reduced symmetry prevented

us from performing core-correlation calculations for nonidentity SN 2 reactions, except for

the F/Cl nonidentity case.

From Table 2, it can be seen that the ﬁnal W1′ and W2h energy values for the iden-

tity reactions are very close to each other. Considering the very close agreement between

W1′ and W2h results, the conclusion is warranted that the results from W1′ theory can

be used as reference values to compare the results from other methods when W2h results

are not available. As a general observation, the core contributions for the transition state

structures are noticeably larger than for the ion-molecule complexes (see Table 2). Although

the core-correlation contribution is small in absolute terms, its relative contribution to the

likewise small overall barrier heights can be substantial. For example, it is 0.36 kcal/mol

for [F· · ·CH3· · ·F]−, while the total energy is -0.37 kcal/mol. Likewise, the core correlation

contributions for [Cl· · ·CH3· · ·Cl]− and [Br· · ·CH3· · ·Br]− are nearly 10% and 25% of the

overall barrier (relative to reactants), respectively. At the W2h level, the core correlation

10

contribution to the total energy increases slightly. Scalar relativistic eﬀects exhibit simi-

lar trends as those of core correlation, but the eﬀects are fairly small. Only Cl−· · ·CH3Br,

[Cl· · ·CH3· · ·Br]− and Br−· · ·CH3Cl exhibit noticeable scalar relativistic contributions, due

to the presence of the heavy halogen Br.

Among the identity reactions only [F· · ·CH3· · ·F]− has a transition state below the reac-

tants energy level. In the nonidentity case all the transition state structures lie below the

reactants.

The computed ﬁnal heats of formation (∆H ◦

f ) of CH3X in kcal/mol are compared with

experiment in Table 3. Both W1′ and W2h values are presented after accounting for ZPVEs

and thermal corrections calculated at the B3LYP/cc-pVTZ+1 level. At this level the ZPVEs,

after scaling by 0.985,43 are found to be 24.16, 23.26 and 22.89 kcal/mol, respectively, for

CH3F, CH3Cl and CH3Br. The corresponding thermal corrections are -1.92, -1.89 and -3.68

kcal/mol. The computed ∆H ◦

f value for CH3Cl lies within the experimental error bar: the

experimental value for CH3F is a crude estimate (±7 kcal/mol) and our computed value is

certainly more reliable. Our calculated value for CH3Br is slightly outside the experimental

error bar: some of the discrepancy could be due to the limitations of the scalar relativistic

treatment. As shown by Bauschlicher,79 the simple DMV correction starts to exhibit minor

deﬁciencies for third-row compounds; for ﬁrst- and second-row compounds, it is in excellent

agreement with more rigorous treatments.80,81

Also included in Table 3 are calculated electron aﬃnities of X (X = F, Cl and Br) in eV

together with experimental results. Using a similar approach, but with even larger spdf ghi

basis sets as well as full CI corrections, we were able82 to reproduce the experimental EAs

of the 1st- and 2nd-row atoms to within ±0.001 eV on average. The presently calculated

W2h results of F and Cl EAs diﬀer by only about 0.001 eV from these benchmark values

(EA(F)=3.403 eV and EA(Cl)=3.611 eV), and the W2h results for F, Cl and Br are all

within 0.003 eV of experiment. Although the W1′ values diﬀer about 0.01 eV for F and Cl

and 0.02 eV for Br, this is comparable to the W1/W2 target accuracy (0.25 kcal/mol on

average). The performance of the W1′ and W2h methods for the reactants and products is

obviously encouraging for the study of the problem at hand.

C. SN 2 Reactions

The reaction mechanism with the double-well potential energy surface for the gas-phase

SN 2 reactions is shown in Figure 1. Obviously, the energy proﬁle is symmetric for the

identity reactions (Figure 1a), and asymmetric for the nonidentity reactions (Figure 1b).

The complexation energy (∆H comp), central barrier (∆H‡

cent), and overall activation barrier

relative to the separated reactants (∆H‡

ovr) are deﬁned in Figure 1. In the nonidentity case,

the following additional quantities are deﬁned in Figure 1b: overall enthalpy change for the

reaction (∆Hovr) and the central enthalpy diﬀerence ∆Hcent between product and reactant

ion-molecule complexes, 3 and 1.

D. Identity Reactions

Complexation energies (∆H comp), overall barrier heights (∆H‡

ovr) and central barriers

(∆H‡

cent) obtained from W1′ and W2h methods are compared in Table 4 with DFT, Gn,

and CBS-QB3 methods together with available experimental values.

It should be emphasized that the experimental data for the SN 2 reactions are insuﬃcient

and the available data are subject to large uncertainties. Therefore, it would be appropriate

to analyze the performance of various methods with respect to Wn methods. First of all,

note that the mPW1K/6-31+G* ∆H comp (13.55 kcal/mol) for the F/F case is very close to

the W1′ and W2h results (13.66 and 13.72 kcal/mol, respectively). mPW1K/cc-pVDZ(+X)

and mPW1K/cc-pVTZ(+X) methods however predict lower ∆H comp values.

In fact, the

B3LYP, B97, HCTH-120, mPW1PW91, mPWH&HPW91 and mPW1K methods all predict

roughly 1 kcal/mol lower complexation energies, while BH&HLYP and B97-1 agree well with

W1′ and W2h. (The HCTH ∆H comp is much lower than the others, vide infra.) G2 and CBS-

QB3 values are close to the Wn results while the G3 method predicts higher complexation

energy compared to the Wn methods. Inclusion of diﬀuse functions for the Gn and CBS-QB3

reference geometries (i.e. Gn(+) and CBS-QB3(+)) increases the ∆H comp value by 0.4–0.6

kcal/mol.

A comparison of overall barrier heights is presented in the third column of Table 4. Both

12

W1′ (-0.37 kcal/mol) and W2h (-0.34 kcal/mol) theories predict negative barrier heights in

the F/F case and the values are very close. The CBS-QB3(+) result is in excellent agreement

therewith; all Gn theories predict barrier heights that are lower by 1 kcal/mol, with further

lowering seen at the G2(+) and G3(+) levels. Among the DFT methods considered, only

mPW1K/6-31+G* and HCTH/cc-pVDZ(+X) fortuitously predict overall barrier heights

close to the Wn results: basis set extension for mPW1K leads to positive overall barrier

heights, which are likewise found for the ”half and half” functionals. B3LYP, B97(-1) and

HCTH-120 all signiﬁcantly underestimate the barrier, mPW1PW91 to a lesser extent.

For the chlorine identity gas-phase SN 2 reactions, fairly accurate experimental values

are available and are presented in Table 4. The experimental values reported by Li and

coworkers11 correspond to the standard state. Hence, thermal corrections and ZPVEs are

subtracted from experimental values in order to compare with the ”bottom of the well”

calculated values. It is noteworthy that the W1′ (10.54 kcal/mol) and W2h (10.94 kcal/mol)

complexation energies are in good agreement with the experimental value (10.53 kcal/mol).

CBS-QB3 results are also in agreement with the Wn and experimental values, while those

from DFT calculations are less satisfactory as they are about 1 kcal/mol lower. Also note

that the G1 and G2 methods reproduce the complexation energy well, while G3 results are

0.5 kcal/mol higher than the Wn and experimental values.

The overall barrier height for the Cl/Cl reaction is found to be 3.07 and 2.67 kcal/mol

at the W1′ and W2h levels of theory. Note ﬁrst that the experimental value (2.90 kcal/mol)

is very close and lies between the W1′ and W2h values. The ∆H‡

ovr value calculated at the

mPW1K/6-31+G*, and CBS-QB3 levels of theory as well as the G2(+) value by Radom et

al.18 and the CCSD(T)/spdf g value by Botschwina23 agree well with the W2h result. The

mPW1K exchange-correlation functional with the cc-pVDZ(+X) and cc-pVTZ(+X) basis

sets predict somewhat higher ∆H‡

ovr values, while the G1, G2MP2 and G3(+) values are

about 1 kcal/mol lower. B3LYP, B97, B97-1, and HCTH-120 all predict a negative overall

barrier for the Cl/Cl system, in disagreement with all other methods considered and with

experiment. BH&HLYP performs moderately well, while mPWH&HPW91 predicts a larger

barrier height (4.50 kcal/mol) than Wn. The central barrier values presented in the last

13

column of the Table 4 reveal that the agreement between Wn theories (13.61 kcal/mol)

and experiment (13.66 kcal/mol) is excellent. The G2MP2, G2(+) and CBS-QB3 methods

also reproduce the central barriers very well. As expected from the overall barrier heights,

the DFT results are less satisfactory, except for mPW1K/cc-pVDZ(+X) and mPW1K/cc-

pVTZ(+X) which are in good agreement with the Wn values.

For the bromine identity SN 2 reaction, W1′ theory predicts 10.03 kcal/mol for ∆H comp.

Note that the G2(+) value is in close agreement with W1′ theory. The reported experimental

value (11.34±0.4 kcal/mol) agrees fairly well. Most DFT levels of theory considered suggest a

complexation energy about 1 kcal/mol lower than the W1′ value, except mPW1K/6-31+G**

which is higher (12.78 kcal/mol, probably an artifact of the small basis set); B97 and B97-

1 which closely bracket the W1′ value; HCTH-120 which is close to the W1′ value (see

below); and HCTH which is 2.5 kcal/mol lower than the latter. The complexation energies

for X−· · ·CH3X are found to decrease in the order F > Cl > Br. This trend was noted

previously by Radom and coworkers,18 who attributed it to the electronegativities of the

halogens.

The overall barrier height for the Br/Br reaction is found to be 1.02 and 0.77 kcal/mol at

the W1′ and W2h levels of theory. Of the various exchange-correlation functionals consid-

ered, only BH&HLYP, mPWH&HPW91, and mPW1K ﬁnd positive barriers (as do the Gn

theories). It should be pointed out that the DFT results for this system display appreciable

basis set sensitivity: for instance, the mPW1K/6-31+G* overall barrier has the wrong sign.

It is interesting to note that the complexation energy derived from the experimental overall

(1.73 kcal/mol83) and central (11.68 kcal/mol84) barrier heights is 9.95 kcal/mol while the

reported experimental complexation energy (11.34 kcal/mol)11 is inconsistent with the de-

rived value. In fact, the derived value is in excellent agreement with the W1′ value (10.03

kcal/mol). This clearly suggests that the experimental data should be re-examined.

The performance of both B97 and B97-1 for the identity reactions is quite similar to that

of B3LYP. While the ‘pure DFT’ HCTH functional appears to yield markedly better over-

all barrier heights, this comes at the expense of signiﬁcantly underestimated complexation

energies (and severely overestimated ion-molecule distances, see Supplementary Material).

14

It was previously noted85 that HCTH severely underestimates interaction energies of H-

bonded complexes; this was ascribed to the absence of anions and H-bonded dimers in the

original HCTH parametrization set. A reparametrization72 against an enlarged sample of

high-quality ab initio energies, denoted HCTH-120, eliminates this particular problem.85 For

the identity SN 2 reactions, we ﬁnd that complexation energies (and ion-molecule distances)

are dramatically improved compared to HCTH: no corresponding improvement is however

seen for the central barrier heights, and the overall barrier heights deteriorate accordingly.

Overall, the DFT methods are less satisfactory for barrier height calculations. Although

the performance of mPW1K/6-31+G* method for F/F and Cl/Cl reactions was excellent,

it is not the ultimate low cost method for barrier heights as it has predicted a negative

barrier for the Br/Br system. This behavior illustrates the inadequacy of the 6-31+G* basis

set for Br: the more extended correlation consistent basis sets with the mPW1K exchange-

correlation functional do predict the sign correctly. In addition, Gn(+) and CBS-QB3(+)

provide an acceptable account of reaction energetics.

E. Nonidentity Reactions

A comparison of computed and experimental complexation energies for the nonidentity

SN 2 reactions is provided in Table 5. For the F−· · ·CH3Cl ion-molecule complex we could

ﬁnd a stationary point neither at the MP2/6-31G* level of theory used for the G2 and G3

reference geometries nor at the B3LYP/6-311G(2d, d, p) level used for the CBS-QB3 reference

geometries; at these levels of theory, the optimization leads to Cl−· · ·CH3F even if the initial

geometries were chosen to correspond to F−· · ·CH3Cl. Addition of diﬀuse functions to the

basis set for the reference geometry remedies the problem. Similarly, in the F/Br case only

the Br− · · ·CH3F complex is found as a stationary point at the MP2/6-31G* level of theory,

and the transition state and second ion-molecule complex only appear when diﬀuse functions

are added to the basis set. Furthermore, and regardless of the basis set employed, none of

the DFT functionals except mPW1K, mPWH&HPW91, and BH&HLYP ﬁnd a transition

state or a F− · · ·CH3Br complex. (The CBS-QB3 method is not deﬁned for Br and hence

15

no CBS-QB3 data are presented for the F/Br and Cl/Br ion-molecule complexes.) Table 5

also presents large-scale CCSD(T) energetics for the F/Cl22 and Cl/Br24 cases reported by

Botschwina and coworkers. Available experimental values are presented at the end of the

Table with uncertainties in parentheses.

Examination of Table 5 indicates that the ∆H comp values strongly depend on the nucle-

ophile (Y−), decreasing in the order F− > Cl− > Br−. They also depend on the leaving

group (X−), in the order CH3F < CH3Cl < CH3Br. Similar observations were made earlier

by Radom and coworkers.19

Comparison of the complexation energies obtained from various methods with W1′ theory

indicates that all DFT results for Cl−· · ·CH3F are lower by 1 kcal/mol. The only available

experimental value86 for Cl−· · ·CH3F (∆H o = 11.41 kcal/mol) has an uncertainty of 2.01

kcal/mol. Comparison of this value with the calculated values suggest that more accurate

measurements are in order. For Cl−· · ·CH3Br and Br−· · ·CH3Cl, rather more accurate high-

pressure mass spectrometry data are available (12.54 and 11.01 kcal/mol). The W1′ values

(11.91 and 10.32 kcal/mol) are very close to the experimental results, considering the exper-

imental uncertainty of 0.4 kcal/mol. While the mPW1K/6-31+G* values for Cl−· · ·CH3Br

and Br−· · ·CH3Cl are fortuitously within the experimental error bars, the other DFT meth-

ods predict lower values. Also note that G2(+) predicts complexation energies close to W1′

and experiment for Cl−· · ·CH3Br, while the Br−· · ·CH3Cl value is small. A complete as-

sessment of CBS-QB3 is not possible as it could not be applied to the bromine-containing

systems.

Like for the identity reactions, complexation energies are signiﬁcantly underestimated

(and ion-molecule distances overestimated by up to 0.3 ˚A: see Supplementary Material) by

HCTH, and this problem is mostly remedied by HCTH-120. B97 and especially B97-1 appear

to represent an improvement over B3LYP for the complexation energies.

Calculated overall reaction enthalpies, central enthalpy diﬀerences between reactant and

product ion-molecule complexes, overall barrier heights, and central barrier heights for the

nonidentity SN 2 reactions are presented with available experimental results in Table 6. It

needs to be reemphasized that all values are “bottom-of-the-well” (i.e, zero-point exclusive):

16

that is, the experimental values are presented after subtracting the ZPVEs (scaled by 0.985)

and thermal corrections obtained using the B3LYP method.

The overall reaction enthalpies of the three nonidentity reactions, viz F/Cl, F/Br, and

Cl/Br, calculated at the W1′ level are -32.65, -41.43 and -8.56 kcal/mol, respectively. The

corresponding experimental values are available and are presented in Table 6. The exper-

imental value for the F/Cl reaction (-33.34 kcal/mol) is in close agreement with the W1′

value. B3LYP, B97(-1), mPW1PW91, Gn, and CCSD(T)/spdf g results are all in close

agreement with the W1′ value, but mPW1K, ”half and half” and CBS-QB3 theories pre-

dict 3-5 kcal/mol higher exothermicity. For the F/Br reaction, the mPW1K/6-31+G* and

mPW1PW91/cc-pVTZ(+X) methods yield overall reaction enthalpies which are quite close

to the W1′ result. The experimental result (-40.20 kcal/mol) is in good agreement with the

best calculated values considering the uncertainty of 1 kcal/mol. The Gn theories predict

exothermicities below, and mPW1K/cc-pVnZ(+X) above, the W1′ value. Concerning the

Cl/Br nonidentity reaction, the reported experimental value (-6.86 kcal/mol) diﬀers from

the W1′ value by 2 kcal/mol. As expected, the very recent CCSD(T)/spdf gh results of

Botschwina and coworkers24 are in close agreement with our predictions. Our results suggest

that the Cl/Br experimental data may need to be reconsidered. Note the signiﬁcant basis set

dependence in the mPW1K results, which illustrates the inadequacy of the 6-31+G* basis

set.

As a general observation, 50:50 admixture of HF exchange in the DFT theories increases

the magnitude of the overall reaction enthalpy, and the increase is greater in BH&HLYP than

in mPWH&HPW91. Performance of B97 and B97-1 for the overall reaction enthalpies is

similar to B3LYP, while HCTH and HCTH-120 represent underestimates in absolute value.

At the W1′ level of theory, the calculated central barrier (∆H‡

cent) for the F/Cl system

is 2.89 kcal/mol. Gn(+), CBS-QB3(+), BH&HLYP, mPWH&HPW91, and mPW1K all

reproduce the W1′ value moderately well, while B3LYP, mPW1PW91, B97, B97-1, HCTH,

and HCTH-120 all underestimate the central barriers. The experimental central barrier for

the F/Cl system is nearly 4 kcal/mol higher than the calculated values. Judging from the

performance of the various methods for the identity SN 2 reactions, it is almost certain that

17

the experimental F/Cl central barrier is in error and unambiguous new measurements are

in order. For the F/Cl and Cl/Br systems, the B3LYP, mPW1PW91, B97, B97-1, HCTH,

and HCTH-120 central barriers are all underestimated, while these exchange-correlation

functionals ﬁnd no barrier at all for the F/Br case. Like for the identity case, mPW1K/cc-

pVTZ(+X) and BH&HLYP/cc-pVTZ(+X) central barriers agree well with the benchmark

ab initio values, although the basis set sensitivity of particularly the Cl/Br results argues

against using small basis sets like 6-31+G*.

Several studies have reported experimental overall barrier heights (∆H‡

ovr), but only for

the Cl/Br system, and the experimental data range from -0.61 to -1.83 kcal/mol. To our

knowledge, no experimental data are available for the F/Cl and F/Br systems. For the Cl/Br

system, the theoretical values span a range from -1.17 to -6.60 kcal/mol. Nevertheless, it

is worth noting that the W1′ value (-1.82 kcal/mol) for the Cl/Br system is in excellent

agreement with the experimental overall barrier height reported by Caldwell and coworkers9

(-1.83 kcal/mol, after accounting for ZPVE and thermal corrections). Some caution should

be exercised as the W1′ value does not include the core correlation contribution. Also note

that G2 theory (-1.82 kcal/mol) reproduces the W1′ value very well. Except for mPW1K/cc-

pVTZ(+X), mPWH&HPW91/cc-pVTZ(+X), and BH&HLYP/cc-pVTZ(+X), all the DFT

methods perform poorly, consistent with the preceding discussion.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

A benchmark study using the W1′ and W2h methods has been carried out for the po-

tential surface of the gas-phase SN 2 reactions Y− + CH3X −→ CH3Y + X−. A number

of more approximate (and less expensive) methods — both compound models (like G2/G3

theory and CBS-QB3) and density functional methods — have been applied in an attempt

to assess their performance for barrier heights in SN 2 reactions. We arrive at the following

conclusions.

(1) Our best calculations are in excellent agreement with experiment for the ∆H ◦

f values

of the methyl halides (where available) and the electron aﬃnities of the halogens. Where

18

accurate experimental data are available for the title reactions (e.g. for the Cl/Cl case), our

best calculations agree with experiment to within overlapping uncertainties. Our calculations

however suggest that more reliable experimental data are in order for most of the reactions

considered.

(2) The nonidentity SN 2 reactions and F/F identity reaction possess transition state struc-

tures below the reactants energy while Cl/Cl and Br/Br transition structures are above the

reactants energy. The complexation energies for identity SN 2 reactions are found to increase

in the order Br < Cl < F while the barrier heights follow the order F <

∼ Br < Cl. The

complexation energies for the nonidentity SN 2 reactions indicate that the ∆H comp strongly

depend on the nucleophile and leaving group.

(3) The B3LYP, and to a lesser extent, mPW1PW91 exchange-correlation functionals sys-

tematically underestimate barrier heights and, in the F/Br case, are not even able to locate

the correct stationary points on the potential surface. The latter problem is remedied by

using the corresponding ‘half-and-half’ functionals BH&HLYP and mPWH&HPW91, which

however appear to somewhat overcorrect the barrier height. The B97 and B97-1 function-

als perform similarly to B3LYP for the problem under study. The ‘pure DFT’ HCTH and

HCTH-120 functionals both underestimate central barrier heights; HCTH in addition under-

estimates complexation energies (and severely overestimates ion-molecule distances), which

are however well reproduced by HCTH-120. Overall, the mPW1K functional appears to

put in the best performance of all DFT methods considered, especially when using extended

basis sets.

(4) The performance of G2(+), G3(+), and CBS-QB3(+) methods for the energetics still

appears to be superior to the DFT methods. (The ‘(+)’ stands for the addition of diﬀuse

functions to the basis set used in obtaining the reference geometries; this is mandatory to

get transition states at all in the F/Br and Cl/Br cases.) The limitations for transition

states of the B3LYP exchange-correlation functional suggest its replacement — at least for

kinetics applications — by mPW1K in thermochemistry methods that employ DFT reference

geometries, e.g. G3B3, CBS-QB3, and W1 theory. (In addition, larger basis sets than 6-

31+G* should deﬁnitely be considered for the Br compounds.)

19

The present calculations illustrate the power of state-of-the-science theoretical methods

in providing both qualitative and quantitative information regarding the reaction energetics.

In the absence of accurate experimental data, our high quality results should be useful to

future experimental and theoretical studies.

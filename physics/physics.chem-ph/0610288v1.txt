In this paper we discuss a method for calculating transfer integrals based on the ZINDO Hamil-
tonian which requires only a single self consistent ﬁeld on an isolated molecule to be performed in
order to determine the transfer integral for a pair of molecules. This method is compared to results
obtained by projection of the pair of molecules’ molecular orbitals onto the vector space deﬁned
by the molecular orbitals of each isolated molecule. The two methods are found to be in good
agreement using three compounds as model systems: pentacene, ethylene and hexabenzocoronene.

I.

INTRODUCTION

In a disordered material - such as a glass of small molecules or a conjugated polymer ﬁlm- charge transport
can be modeled as a series of discrete hops on an idealized lattice; rates are controlled by parameters distributed
according to some empirical distribution chosen to ﬁt the experimentally measured ﬁeld and temperature dependence
of mobility[1, 2, 3] . The fundamental mechanism underpinning charge transport in many disordered organic solids
is thought to be small polaron hopping, which - in the high temperature limit - can be described by the Marcus
Equation [4]:

|J|2
~ r

π
λkT

exp(−

(∆E − λ)2
4λkT

)

(1)

where J represents the transfer integral, ∆E represents the diﬀerence in site energies, λ is the reorganization
energy and all other symbols have their usual meanings. In our opinion, it would be a signiﬁcant improvement if the
parameters of this equation could be calculated for realistic morphologies, helping to clarify the relationship between
chemical structure and charge mobility and reducing the number of free parameters in the modeling of data: the
diﬃculty lies in the fact that simulation volumes can contain millions of molecules and therefore these parameters
must be calculated using eﬃcient, fast algorithms. In this paper we wish to discuss a computational prerequisite to
solving the dynamics of electron motion in a disordered medium: the design of eﬃcient algorithms for computing the
transfer integral J.

The method is based on the ZINDO hamiltonian [5] and makes some approximations to allow calculation of transfer
integrals without the necessity for performing self consistent ﬁeld (SCF) calculations on pairs of molecules: only a
single SCF calculation on 1 isolated molecule will be performed. It will require only the calculation of atomic overlap
and can be thought of as being based on the calculation of molecular orbital overlap: for this reason we dub the
method Molecular Orbital Overlap (MOO). The ZINDO Hamiltonian has been used extensively to calculate transfer
integrals [6], even though recently it has become apparent the simply taking the splitting of the top two molecular
orbitals is not always accurate because of polarization eﬀects; another method which has been used by Siebbeles and
coworkers exploits the molecular fragment capabilities of ADF to calculate J [7], although it has been pointed out
by Valeev and co-workers that this ought to be corrected for molecular overlap [8]. In this paper we will show how
to rewrite the Fock matrix from the ZINDO method in terms of localized monomer orbitals by orbital projection to
obtain results similar to those obtained by the molecular fragment method. We will compare the results with those
from MOO, showing how the agreement is very good. The model systems we study are ethylene, pentacene and
hexa-benzocoronene (HBC). It should also be noted that we have carried out these test only for pairs of identical
molecules and that the following derivations are labelled accordingly; extension to the general case is trivial.

The deﬁnition of the transfer integral for charge transport from molecule A to molecule B is:

where H represents the Hamiltonian for the system, Φ represents the multi-electron wavefunction of the molecule and
the labels A and B denote whether the charge is localized on molecule A or B. Assume the multi-electron wavefunctions
are described by single Slater determinants and invoke the frozen orbital approximation to argue the ΦA and ΦB
diﬀer only by the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) on molecule A and molecule B, which will be singly
occupied in molecule A and B respectively. If we were interested in transport of negative charge, we would obviously
use the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). Using Slater Rules [9] we can evaluate the previous equation
as:

where F represents the Fock matrix and φhomoA and φhomoB represent the HOMOs of molecule A and B respectively.
We will always consider the case of calculating transfer integrals for two Slater determinants which diﬀer in one
molecular orbital only, therefore evaluating equation 3 is always going to be our task.

II. METHOD

J =< φhomoA|F |φhomoB >

A. Projective Method

In order to solve equation 3 we will invoke the spectral theorem, project the molecular orbitals (MOs) of the dimer
onto a basis set deﬁned by the MOs of the individual molecules, then - knowing the eigenvalues of the MOs of the
dimer - we will reconstruct the Fock matrix in the basis set of the MOs of individual moleculs and simply read oﬀ J
from the appropriate indeces of our new Fock matrix. The basis set deﬁned by the MOs of the individual molecules
Cloc will be deﬁned as:

where φi
j labels the component in terms of atomic orbital (AO) j of molecular orbitals i. The AOs are numbered
2 orbitals are localized on molecule A, and the second N
so that the ﬁrst N
2 are localized on molecule B, similarly
the molecular orbitals localized on molecule A are labeled with the ﬁrst N
2 labels and the ones on molecule B are
labeled with the second N
2 labels. The localized orbitals are deduced from SCF calculations on the isolated molecules
respectively, seeing as how the two molecules are identical only one SCF calculation is required, the other set of orbitals
can be obtained by rotating the orbitals of the ﬁrst molecule according to the spatial orientation of the second.

In order to project the MOs of the dimer Cdym onto Cloc and obtain the orbitals of the dimer in the localized MO

basis set all we have to do is invoke the spectral theorem and obtain:

where the superscript t denotes transposition and Cloc

dym represents the orbitals of the dimer in the localized basis
set. All that is left to do is use the dimer eigenvalues ǫdym and rewrite the Fock matrix F in the new basis set to
obtain the Fock matrix in the localized basis set:

where F loc represents the Fock matrix in the localized basis set and the eigenvalues ǫdym have been written in
diagonal matrix form. Now transfer integrals can simply be read from the oﬀ-diagonal elements of this matrix, it
we are interested in the transfer integral between the HOMO on molecule A and the HOMO on molecule B - and
assuming that the HOMO is the ith orbital of molecule A - we would simply read the element F loc

B. Molecular Orbital Overlap calculation of J

In this section we will explain how to evaluate directly equation 3 in the ZINDO approximation and how further
approximation can be used to make the running of a SCF calculation on a dimer unnecessary. If we write the HOMOs
on molecule A and B, labelling the AOs in the same fashion we used in the deﬁnition of Cloc, we can see that the only
elements of the Fock matrix which we need to calculate are the oﬀ-diagonal blocks of the Fock matrix connecting the
AOs on molecule A with the AOs on molecule B. These elements will necesseraly involve AOs on diﬀerent centres,
therefore their form will be:

+ Pµν

γAB
2

Fµν = ¯Sµν

(βA + βB)
2
where ¯S represents the overlap matrix of atomic overlaps with σ and π overlap between p orbitals weighed diﬀerently,
A and B labels the two atomic centres that the µ and ν atomic orbitals are centred on, βA labels the ionization
potential of molecule A , Pµν labels the density matrix and ﬁnally γ is the Mataga-Nashimoto potential. We assume
that Pµν is block diagonal and therefore does not contribute to the elements of the Fock matrix we are interested in
calculating. This assumption for the dimer orbitals will hold both if the dimer orbitals are identical to the monomer
ones or if each pair of orbitals of the dimer can be written as a constructive/destructive combination of pairs of
monomer orbitals. To see why the latter is the case consider two particular dimer occupied orbitals φi and φi+1
which are formed from a bonding and anti-bonding combination of the occupied monomer orbitals φAj and φBj. The
contribution of these two orbitals to the density matrix will be of the form:

(7)

= 2.0((φAj + φBj )t)(φAj + φBj) + 2.0(φAj − φBj)t(φAj − φBj ))

P i,i+1 = 2.0(φt

iφi + φt

i+1φi+1)

= 2.0(2φt

AjφAj + 2φt

BjφBj)

Where P i,i+1 represents the contribution of dimer orbitals φi and φi+1 to the density matrix. Because all monomer
orbitals φA and φB are localized on one molecule only, this contribution will be block diagonal, also because all
contributions to the density matrix will be of this form, the density matrix will be - overall - block diagonal. The task
of determining values for the Fock matrix has therefore been reduced to the comparatively simple task of determining
¯S, the weighed atomic orbital overlap. Atomic overlaps between 1s, 2s and 2p orbitals can be determined analytically
using the expressions derived in [10], the π and σ components of the < p|p > overlaps must be weighed according to
the appropriate proportionality factors, in accordance with the scheme devised by Zerner and coworkers. This can
be done without the need to perform a SCF calculation on the dimer, thereby achieving our set goal of estimating
transfer integrals for dimers whilst performing only one calculation on the monomers to obtain the orbitals φhomoA
and φhomoB .

III. COMPUTATION DETAILS

For both the projective and MOO methods, some information has to be extracted from a SCF calculation: in the
case of the projective method we need the monomer MOs, the dimer MO and the dimer eigenvalues. For the MOO
method, all we need are the monomer MOs for which we want to evaluate the expectation of the Fock matrix for. All
information from self consistent ﬁeld calculations is extracted from g03 [11]. The matrix operations for the projective
method and the analytic solution to the AO overlaps for the MOO method are all computed with in-house code. The
MOO libraries are written for row 1 and 2 atoms and will soon be realised on Gnu Public Licence. Both methods
require starting geometries for each monomer, these were computed with g03 and the the B3LYP/6-31g* level.

In this section we will show the results of comparison of the results from the projective and MOO methods. We
will use ethylene and pentacene as examples of a conjugated molecule and HBC as an example of a high symmetry
conjugated molecule where we will show that it is necessary to calculate diﬀerent transfer integrals to deﬁne an
eﬀective transfer integral. The geometries which we use to compare these methods are shown in ﬁgure 1, these are:
rotation around the C=C bond for one of the two molecules in an ethylene dimer, slip along the long axis of one of
two pentacene molecules and x,y,z displacement of a HBC molecule in a dimer.

The results for ethylene are shown in ﬁgure 2, as it is expected from the planarity of the molecule, the transfer
integral falls to 0 for perpendicular. These results are in qualitative agreement with the DFT results of Valeev
and co-workers [8], even though the value of the transfer integral from ZINDO is roughly half of that from DFT.
Certainly the projective and MOO methods are in excellent agreement, with a discrepancy between the two methods
of approximately 10%. The results for pentacene are shown in ﬁgure 3 and -again- are consistent with each other.

Before considering the case of HBC, let us make a few comments on how to approach the problem of determining
transfer integrals for molecules with symmetry induced degeneracy of the frontier orbitals. The physical phenomenone
which one would expect to occur in such a situtation is that - upon charging - the molecule will lose its symmetry
by Jahn-Teller distorsion and that therefore charge transfer will occure between non-degenerate orbitals. In order
to avoid having to calculate many diﬀerent transfer orbitals for the diﬀerent possible distorsions, an approach which
has been used in the literature - section IV D of [12] - is to simply take the root means square value of the four
possible integrals between the two degenerate orbitals, which in our case would be JhomoA homoB , JhomoA homo−1B ,
Jhomo−1A homoB and Jhomo−1A homo−1B . Let us justify this approximation by generalizing equation 3. Assume that

(PRO) methods. The distance between the π planes of the two pentacene molecules is 3.5 ˚A .

ΦA and ΦB are linear combination two Slater determinant, each corresponding to either the HOMO or the HOMO-1
of either molecule being simply occupied. Label these two Slater determinants ΦA1 and ΦA2 respectively for molecule
A and similarly for molecule B. The linear combination ΦA can then be written:

ΦA

= cos(χ)ΦA1

+ sin(χ)ΦA2

(9)

where χ represents the mixing angle for the two conﬁgurations. A similar equation can be written for the localized
state on molecule B. When equation 2 is estimated for the form of Slater determinants from 9 one obtains form
of 3 which involve the mixing angles for molecule A and molecule B and 4 expectation values for the Fock matrix:
JhomoA homoB , JhomoA homo−1B , Jhomo−1A homoB and Jhomo−1A homo−1B . If one squares this expression to obtain the
form of the observable |J|2 and averages this equation over the two mixing angles, one obtains an expression for the
eﬀective transfer integral |Jef f |2 as the average of the other 4 transfer integrals squared. In the case of z displacement,
Jhomo−1A homoB and JhomoA homo−1B are both 0, and the other two terms are the same, in this case, we will plot
JhomoA homoB as a function of distance. This quantity would be the same as half the splitting between the top 2 MOs
and the next 2 MOs of a dimer and is equivalent to Jef f
(2). A plot of this transfer integral calculated using MOO
and deduced from a ZINDO calculation with the projective method is shown in picture 4. Again it can be seen that
p
the two methods are in very close agreement, with the exception of the pair of molecules at 2.5 ˚A , we postulate that
at this distance the assumption of block diagonal density matrix brakes down. The value obtained for this geometry
can also be compared to some from the literature: in [13] a quantitavely similar curve is reported from the splitting
of the frontier orbitals of HBC.

If the dimer is displaced in the xy direction, the terms Jhomo−1A homoB and JhomoA homo−1B are no longer 0 and
JhomoA homoB is no longer equal to Jhomo−1A homo−1B , in this case we will plot Jef f as calculated from the transfer
integrals using either the projective or the MOO methods. Figure 5 shows how - also for this case - the two methods
are again in excellent agreement.

V. CONCLUSIONS

We have shown how to use the spectral theorem to project orbitals of a dimer onto the localized basis set of MOs of
the constituent monomers. We have argued that this method can be used to obtain results similar to those obtained by
the method of fragment orbitals and have shown that in certain cases these results can be compared to those obtained
by looking at the splitting of the frontier orbitals. We have shown that in all these cases the MOO method can be
used to obtain results which are essentially the same as for the projective method, achieving our goal of determining
transfer integrals whilst performing only 1 SCF calculation.

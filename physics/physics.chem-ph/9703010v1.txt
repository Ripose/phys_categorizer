Abstract

The properties of diluted symmetric A-B diblock copolymers at the interface be-
tween A and B homopolymer phases are studied by means of Monte Carlo (MC) simu-
lations of the bond ﬂuctuation model. We calculate segment density proﬁles as well as
orientational properties of segments, of A and B blocks, and of the whole chain. Our
data support the picture of oriented “dumbbells”, which consist of mildly perturbed
A and B Gaussian coils. The results are compared to a self consistent ﬁeld theory
(SCFT) for single copolymer chains at a homopolymer interface. We also discuss the
number of interaction contacts between monomers, which provide a measure for the
“active surface” of copolymers or homopolymers close to the interface.

Introduction

Blending of polymeric substances is a straightforward and inexpensive way of

creating new materials with improved mechanical properties[1]. However, long

polymers of diﬀerent type A and B are often immiscible already at high tem-

peratures, since the total energy of the (usually repulsive) relative interaction

is proportional to the total number of monomers and cannot be balanced by

the entropy of mixing, which is proportional to the number of polymers in

the mixture[2, 3]. In order to overcome this problem, block copolymers con-

taining both types of monomers can be used as eﬀective compatibilizers[4, 5].

Being partly compatible with both the A and B rich phase, they tend to ag-

gregate at interfaces, where they reduce the number of direct contacts between

A and B homopolymers, thereby reducing the interfacial tension[6]. Conse-

quently the total area of interfaces increases, and the immiscible components

may get ﬁnely dispersed in the mixture. Furthermore, copolymers improve

the mechanical properties of such interfaces: Due to entanglement between

homopolymers and copolymers, they increase the adhesive attraction and the

fracture toughness[7, 8, 9]. At high enough copolymer concentrations, addi-

tional copolymer rich phases emerge which may display a diversity of structures

ordered on a mesoscopic scale[10, 11].

The simplest possible copolymers are diblocks, which consist of a block of

A monomers connected to a block of B monomers. From a thermodynamic

point of view, their eﬀect on interfaces can be described as follows: Copolymers

act as amphiphiles in the homopolymer mixture[12]. Increasing the copolymer

concentration causes the interfacial tension to decrease monotonically, until

this process is terminated by the formation of a third, copolymer rich phase,

2

e.g. an ordered lamellar phase or microemulsion. The amphiphilic strength

of a copolymer, i.e., the maximum reduction of the interfacial tension it can

achieve, increases with the length of the A and B blocks relative to the size

of the homopolymers. Mean ﬁeld theories predict that the interfacial tension

can be driven to zero for long copolymers, which implies that the copolymer

rich lamellar phase evolves into the two-phase region via a continuous un-

binding transition[13, 14]. Fluctuations push the transition to ﬁrst order in

real systems[15]. One can argue that the low interfacial tensions at the pres-

ence of copolymers result from the aﬃnity of the system to such an unbinding

transition[16].

This macroscopic discussion however does not shed light on the microscopic

mechanisms, why and how copolymers work as compatibilizer or amphiphiles.

In a simple microscopic picture, the A block of copolymers at interfaces prefer-

ably stick into the A-rich phase, the B block into the B-rich phase, and the

molecules as a whole act as reinforcing rods[7]. The conformations of the

copolymers determine the properties of the interface. A more detailed micro-

scopic description of copolymer properties at interfaces has been developed

by Leibler[17] and reﬁned by Semenov[18]. The analysis is based on the as-

sumption, that the junction points between A and B blocks are conﬁned to a

narrow region, which is much smaller than the width of the copolymer layer

at the interface. The presence of copolymers at the interface gives rise to two

free energy contributions: the entropy of mixing, divided into a translational

term and a swelling term, and the elastic energy of stretching of the copolymer

blocks. A scenario emerges which distinguishes between four diﬀerent regimes:

In the dilute regime, copolymers aggregate at the interface, but do not yet

3

overlap. The A and B blocks are described as weakly perturbed coils, and

the free energy is dominated by the mixing energy. When the mean interchain

distance gets of the order of the block radii of gyration, copolymers start to

stretch and form a “wet brush”. At even higher copolymer concentrations, the

“dry brush” regime is entered, where homopolymers do not penetrate into the

interfacial region; A and B blocks have the conformation of stretched coils and

the free energy is dominated by the elastic energy of stretching. Finally, in

the saturated regime, the density of copolymers at the interface is close to one

and the interfacial segregation of copolymers competes with the formation of

micelles in the bulk[18].

Experimental studies of copolymers at homopolymer interfaces have been

carried out by numerous groups, mostly using neutron reﬂectivity or forward

recoil spectroscopy [19]-[25]. By deuterating individual parts of the homopoly-

mers or the copolymers, the excess of copolymers at the interface can be mea-

sured as well as distributions of homopolymer segments, copolymer segments

or even selected copolymer segments, like the junction point between A and B

or the end segment[25, 26, 27]. These studies have provided detailed insight

into the microscopic structure of such interfaces.

Simple Leibler type theories are already quite successful in reproducing

many of the experimental results[18, 24]. In order to reach quantitative agree-

ment, however, the Flory Huggins parameter χ has to be treated as adjustable,

molecular weight dependent parameter. Less transparent, but more accurate

mean ﬁeld approaches are the self consistent ﬁeld theories[28, 29] or the den-

sity functional theories[30, 31]. The self consistent ﬁeld theory has ﬁrst been

applied to copolymer-homopolymer interfaces by Noolandi and Hong[32] and

4

adjusted to the case of a blend without solvent by Shull and Kramer[33, 34].

It has been shown to be quantitatively successful in predicting the correct

copolymer excess at the interface, using a χ-parameter which is taken from

independent bulk measurements[25]. The calculated width of the segment

interface is somewhat too low, but the discrepancies can be understood quan-

titatively if broadening due to capillary waves is accounted for[22, 25]. Such a

remarkable success of a mean ﬁeld theory is characteristic for polymeric sub-

stances, in which high molecular weight polymers interact with a high number

of other polymers[2, 35]. In addition to reproducing experimental data, the

self consistent ﬁeld theory also has the advantage of yielding further structural

information, e.g. on chain conformations, monomer orientations etc.[36, 45],

which may be hard to access experimentally. Unfortunately, the theory also

has some serious drawbacks. In particular, the usual treatment of polymers as

Gaussian random walks is questionable for chains of the minority component,

e.g. A in the B rich phase, and generally on length scales smaller than the

screening length of the excluded volume[45].

Computer simulations provide another way of obtaining additional informa-

tion on the microscopic structure of interfaces. Simulations of inhomogeneous

polymeric systems are computationally extremely demanding, and therefore

rare. Minchau et al [37] and Fried and Binder[38, 39] have investigated the

phase behavior of pure copolymer systems. Pan et al studied microphase struc-

tures in systems of short copolymers, which are swollen by a small amount

(volume fraction 10 %) of longer homopolymers[40]. Wang and Mattice have

studied the adsorption of self avoiding copolymers at a stationary, sharp in-

terface, modelled by an external ﬁeld with a sharp kink[41]. A similar study

5

has been performed for a random copolymer by Peng et al [42]. More detailed

simulations have been presented by Cifra[43].

In this work, we present a study of copolymers at the interface between

homopolymer phases, where both homopolymers and copolymers are treated

in microscopic detail. Pure homopolymer interfaces in immiscible A/B blends

have been analyzed previously[44] and compared to the predictions of a self

consistent ﬁeld theory[45]. Here, we consider the eﬀect of adding a small

number of symmetric diblock copolymers to such a “known” homopolymer in-

terface. We restrict ourselves to the diluted case, where the copolymer coils

do almost not overlap, and where the static structure of the interface is essen-

tially that of a pure homopolymer interface. The results are compared to self

consistent ﬁeld theory calculations for a single copolymer in a homopolymer

interface. Our paper is organized as follows: The next section describes the

simulation model and method, and ends with a few comments on the self con-

sistent ﬁeld theory. The results are presented in section three. In particular,

we discuss segment density proﬁles, chain and bond orientations, and proﬁles

for the number of interacting contacts between monomers. We summarize and

conclude in the last section.

2 The Bond Fluctuation Model

With the presently available computational resources, molecular modelling of

the phase behavior in polymer blends in atomistic detail is far beyond feasibil-

ity. Fortunately, many important features of such systems are already apparent

in coarse grained models[46], such as the bond ﬂuctuation model on a cubic

lattice[47]. The latter models polymers as chains of N eﬀective monomers,

6

which occupy each a cube of 8 neighboring sites and are connected by bond

vectors of length 2, √5, √6, 3, or √10 in units of the lattice spacing a0. One

such cube represents a group of n

3

5 chemical monomers. Hence a total

≈

−
chain length of 32, as has been used here, corresponds to a degree of polymer-
ization of approx. 100-160 in a real polymer. At volume fraction φ = 0.5a−3
monomer density ρ = 1/16 a−3

0 , the model reproduces many important proper-

0 or

ties of dense polymer melts, e.g. single chain conﬁgurations show almost ideal

Gaussian chain statistics, the single chain structure factor follows a Debye

function, and the collective scattering function has the experimental form[48].

The relative repulsion between monomers of type A and B is modelled

by introducing symmetric energy parameters εAA = εBB =

εAB =

kBT ε,

−

−

which describe the pairwise interaction between monomers at distances of less

than √6 a0. At ε = 0.1, the interactions between monomers are dominated by

the eﬀect of excluded volume, and the mixture can be described as a weakly

perturbed athermal melt; in particular, the equation of state and the compress-

ibility are almost not aﬀected by the presence of the interactions[49]. From ex-

tensive previous study of this model, the relation of these model parameters to

commonly used parameters in polymer theories is well known. At chain length

N = 32, the statistical segment length b is given by b = 3.05 a0[44], the radius

of gyration is Rg =

N/6 b

7 a0, the compressibility is kBT κ = 3.9 a3

and the Flory Huggins parameter χ can be calculated using χ = 2zε, where

z = 2.65 is the eﬀective coordination number in the bulk, i.e., the average

number of interchain contacts of a monomer[50].

The interfacial properties were studied in a L

size D = 64 and L = 512. The dimensions of the system were chosen such

7

that the width D of the slab is much larger than the gyration radius Rg, i.e.,

almost ten times as large. The boundary conditions are periodic in x and z

direction and “antiperiodic” in the y direction, i.e., A-chain parts leaving the

right part of the simulation box reenter it on the left side as B-chain parts

and vice versa. Since no mechanism ﬁxes the interface at a certain position,

the interface position is subject to diﬀusion due to thermal ﬂuctuations. We

choose the coordinate system such that the origin of the y-axis is at the center

y0 of the interfacial proﬁle, which we determine via[51]

Here m = ρA −
relative monomer densities are deﬁned by ρA,B = φA,B/φ, where φA and φB

ρB is the order parameter of the demixing transition and the

contains 32768 polymers of equal chain length 32. As initial conﬁguration, we

choose a relaxed conﬁguration of a pure homopolymer interface[44], randomly

pick 1024 chains with the center of mass at distances of less than

δ from

±

the interface with δ = 3 or 9, and turn them into copolymers. No eﬀect

of the choice of δ on the results has been found. The simulation algorithm

involves random hopping of randomly chosen monomers by one lattice unit

with Metropolis probability, but no grandcanonical moves, i.e., the number

of copolymers remains ﬁxed. After an initial equilibration time of 2.5

attempted moves per monomer (AMM), the concentration of copolymers in

the bulk at ε = 0.1 is 0.05%

simulations suggest that it should be around 0.04%[52]. We average over 86

conﬁgurations in total, where the data for averaging are taken every 104 AMM.

The area covered by one copolymer can be roughly estimated by πR2

g,b, where

copolymers cover approximately 30% of the total interface area 512

512, i.e.,

×

the system is well in the diluted regime.

We close this section with a brief comment on the self consistent ﬁeld calcu-

lations. In a previous paper, we have compared the properties of homopolymer

interfaces with the predictions of self consistent ﬁeld theories for completely

ﬂexible and semiﬂexible chains with diﬀerent chain rigidities[45]. The quali-

tative agreement between theory and simulation was over all very good. The

main quantitative discrepancy was found in the interfacial width – at chain

length 32, the self consistent ﬁeld theory underestimates the proﬁle widths by

at least a factor of 2. This eﬀect could not be explained by capillary waves

alone, but seemed to be a consequence of the short chain length. At temper-

atures suﬃciently below the critical point, so that critical ﬂuctuations do not

aﬀect the interface any more, the interfacial width gets already comparable to

the screening length of the excluded volume, on which length scale chains can

not be treated as pure random walks. This leads to wrong predictions of the

size of the interface. However, theory and simulations still agree quantitatively

for other quantities, e.g. the reduction of the total density at the interface.

Our present calculations are based on this work. We consider single worm-

like copolymer chains at an interface of wormlike homopolymers. Chains are

represented by space curves ~r(s) with s varying from 0 to 1, and the single

chain partition function of a copolymer is given by

The distribution of copolymer segments is calculated by solving appropriate

for chain parts of length sN < N, which begin on the A side (Q) or the B

side (Q+) of the copolymer[54, 55]. From those one can calculate the density

3 Results

All results presented here were obtained at ε = 0.1 or χN = 17, i.e., the

system is far from the critical point ((χN)c = 2.4 [48, 50]) in the strong

segregation regime. Simulations were also performed at ε = 0.05; the results

are qualitatively the same, but the eﬀects are less marked.

In the following, lengths are given in units of wSSL = b/√6χ, the interfacial

width of a homopolymer interface in the mean ﬁeld strong segregation limit.

The radius of gyration in these units is Rg = 4.2 wSSL, and the slab thickness

D = 37.4 wSSL.

3.1 Density proﬁles and segment distributions

Figure 1 shows proﬁles of A and B monomer densities in systems with and

without copolymers, proﬁles of just the A and B blocks of the copolymers, and

total density proﬁles. As expected in the diluted regime, the A and B monomer

density proﬁles are hardly aﬀected by the presence of the copolymers. The

interface as a whole is still very similar to a pure homopolymer interface. Due

to the ﬁnite compressibility of the blend, the total density is slightly reduced in

the interfacial region[44]. The distributions of copolymer monomers A and B

agree qualitatively with the experimental results and conﬁrm the simple picture

presented in the introduction: Monomers of type A are more concentrated in

the A-rich phase, Monomers of type B in the B rich-phase. The distribution

is rather broad, a fair portion of the A monomers sticks into the B-rich phase

and vice versa.

Distributions of single chain segments are shown in Figure 2 and 3. For

homopolymers, one ﬁnds a relative enrichment of chain ends ρe at the inter-

11

face, whereas the concentration ρ1/2 of middle segments (the 16th and 17th

monomer) is comparatively low there. The total density proﬁle ρh is best re-

produced by the density proﬁles ρ1/4 of the segments at one and three fourth

of the chain (the 8th and 25th monomer). Looking at the higher concentration

of chain ends at the interface, one is lead to suspect that homopolymers tend

to form loops with two ends at the interface. However, this is not the case,

as can be seen from the distribution ρe−e of midpoints between the two ends

of homopolymers.

It is strongly reduced at the center of the interface and

enhanced at the distance of one gyration radius from there (Figure 2).

Copolymer segment densities show the inverse trend: The middle segments

concentrate at the interface, whereas the chain ends stretch out into their

favorite bulk phase. Hence our results are in qualitative agreement with the

experimental ﬁndings of Russell et al [25]. As in the case of homopolymers,

the total density proﬁles of A and B monomers are almost identical with the

distribution of the 8th and 25th monomer, respectively, i.e., the distribution

of segments in the middle of the A or B block. Note that the peak of the

distribution of middle segments ρ1/2 is relatively broad, broader than the radius

of gyration, hence they are not strongly conﬁned to the interface as assumed

by the Leibler theory (Figure 3). The results of the self consistent ﬁeld theory

are shown in the inset. The fact that the SCFT underestimates the interfacial

width also leads to quantitative discrepancies in the distribution of copolymer

segments. However, the qualitative agreement is very good, and in the wings

of the proﬁle one even reaches quantitative agreement.

12

3.2 Chain and bond orientations

Next we discuss the orientational properties of the polymers. It is instructive

to consider separately the orientations of single bonds, of chain segments, and

of whole chains. Chains with rather weakly oriented single bonds can still be

strongly oriented as a whole, as found by M¨uller et al for homopolymers at a

homopolymer interface[44, 45].

The orientation of whole chains involves two diﬀerent factors. First, chains

may be oriented without volume changes, i.e., the total gyration radius or

end-to-end vector remains unaﬀected by the orientation. A weak orienting

ﬁeld is suﬃcient to bring about orientation of this kind. Second, chains may

get compressed or stretched in one direction. As Figure 4 illustrates, the lat-

ter eﬀect dominates close to an interface. The mean squared components of

the end-to-end vector in directions parallel (x,z) and perpendicular (y) to the

interface are shown for homopolymers and copolymers. The components par-

allel to the interface hardly vary throughout the system. Perpendicular to the

interface, the end-to-end vector of homopolymers is reduced in the interfacial

region, as is already the case in pure homopolymer systems. Homopolymers

are thus squeezed perpendicular to the interface, and get eﬀectively oriented

parallel to the interface.

Copolymers show the inverse behavior, they stretch in the direction perpen-

dicular to the interface. As obtained both from self consistent ﬁeld calculations

and from the simulations, the eﬀect is very strong for copolymers centered at

about one to two radii of gyration away from the interface, and much weaker

for those located in the wings of proﬁle or at the middle of the interface (Fig-

ure 4). One can picture the latter as consisting of two almost independent

13

homopolymer blocks, which hardly feel the eﬀect of being linked together at

one end. Indeed, the vector connecting the ends of the single A or B blocks is

on average hardly oriented (Table 1). Only the blocks centered deep in their

majority phase (y/wSSL ≈
are pulled towards the interface by the other copolymer end (Figure 5). Note

7) stretch perpendicular to the interface, since they

that Figure 5 also demonstrates, how minority blocks (A blocks in the B phase,

B blocks in the A phase) slightly shrink by a factor of approximately 0.8 due
to the hostile environment. The vector ~DAB connecting the centers of mass

of the A and B blocks is on average oriented and strongly stretched in the

negative y direction (Table 1).

In sum, single blocks are mostly not oriented at all; the perpendicular orien-

tation of whole copolymers results from the arrangement of the two constituent

blocks. Diblock copolymers can be pictured as dumbbells[56] consisting of two

mildly perturbed homopolymer coils. Similar copolymer shapes have already

been found by Binder and Fried in simulations of block copolymers in the

disordered phase, far above the ordering transition[39].

Consequently, one would expect that the only region, where the local con-

formation of a diblock diﬀers signiﬁcantly from a homopolymer conformation,

is the region close to the link which connects the two blocks. We study this in
more detail by looking at the orientation of single bonds ~b. In order to do so,

it is useful to deﬁne a bond orientation parameter

(not shown here), hence the bond length is quasi ﬁxed, the bonds get oriented

qualitatively the same, but weaker for end bonds. The bond orientation pa-

1). The results show

the same trend as the simulation data for the middle bonds, but do not predict

b

any eﬀect for the end bonds (Figure 6, inset), unlike what is seen in the MC

simulations. This reﬂects the diﬀerence between the tangent vector at the end

of a continuous space curve, as assumed by SCFT, and an end bond connecting

two discrete statistical monomers of a relatively short chain, as it is the case

in our MC simulation.

In contrast to homopolymer chains, MC data reveal a rather strong depen-

dence of the orientation of bonds in copolymers on their position within the

chain (Figure 7a). The bond which links the two blocks is preferably oriented

perpendicular to the interface – the stronger, the further away its location

from the center of the interface. Already the bonds next to the link bond

show a much smaller eﬀect. The larger the distance along the chain from the

link bond, the stronger the tendency of parallel alignment at the center of the

interface becomes, and the further it reaches out into the wings of the proﬁle.

Hence bonds in the middle and at the end of an A or B block behave very

much like homopolymer bonds. We note en passant that, compared to the

other bonds, the link bond is stretched by

4% due to the relative repulsion

∼

15

between the adjacent A and B monomers.

The results obtained by SCFT show the same trends as the simulation

data (Figure 7b), and agree qualitatively, but the same remarks as above ap-

ply. Thus, SCFT does not reproduce the slight tendency of parallel alignment

which is found in the MC data at the ends of the blocks. The orientational

parameter of the link bond at the center of the proﬁle is q

+0.025 according

≈

to both MC results and SCFT. However, SCFT underestimates the average

orientation (averaged over link bonds in the region shown in Figure 7a) by

30%. At distances of several gyration radii Rg from the interface, the bond

∼
orientation parameter q drops back to zero, indicating that copolymers that

deep in the bulk are oblivious to the eﬀect of the interface. Note that two

diﬀerent length scales are reﬂected in the proﬁles of q. One of them, the width

of the homopolymer interface, ﬁxes the width of the central dip in the proﬁles,

the other one, the gyration radius, determines the overall width of the region

with nonzero q.

3.3 Self and Mutual Contacts

Another instructive quantity in the bond ﬂuctuation model is the number of

monomer “contacts”, i.e., the number of interacting monomer pairs. It is expe-

dient to distinguish between “self contacts”, i.e., contacts between monomers

belonging to the same chain (“intrachain contacts”), and “interchain contacts”

of monomers from two diﬀerent chains. The self contacts provide additional

information on the conformation of single chains, and the interchain contacts

on the arrangement of chains relative to each other.

Figure 8 compares the number of self contacts per monomer Ni,self /ρi in

16

homopolymer (i = h) and copolymer (i = c) chains. The main contribution to

Ni,self /ρi comes from the two direct neighbors of a monomer in the chain, thus

Ni,self /ρi is mostly slightly larger than 2. Note however that direct neighbors

do not always interact with each other, since the maximum bond length √10a0

is larger than the range of the interactions √6 a0. The number of self contacts

in homopolymers is almost constant throughout the system.

It is slightly

enhanced in the wings of the proﬁle and decreases again at the center, where

A and B meet – suggesting that homopolymer chains tend to loop away from

the interface, such that there is no room for intrachain contacts at the center,

but that the number of contacts increases right next to it.

In copolymers,

one ﬁnds the opposite behavior – the relative number of intrachain contacts

is higher at the center of the interface than in homopolymers, but diminishes

rapidly as one moves away from the interface. This trend is promoted by three

factors. First, far from the interface copolymers stretch towards the interface,

and the number of self contacts associated with backfolding goes down. Second,

the stretching goes along with a higher occupation of the (0, 3, 0) bond, which

is outside of the interaction region, hence monomers gradually lose contact to

their direct neighbors. Third, the further away one moves from the interface,

the greater becomes the contribution of chain end monomers, which only have

one direct neighbor in the chain. Obviously,

it would be highly desirable

to study separately the contributions to Ni,self /ρi from monomers which are

direct neighbors in a chain, and from monomers which are further apart from

each other. Unfortunately, such a distinction was not possible due to limited

memory space.

Whereas the number of self contacts reﬂects the conformational properties

of a chain, the demixing of A and B chains in the melt is essentially driven

by the interchain contacts. The number of interchain contacts per monomer

can be interpreted as an eﬀective coordination number zef f . In homogeneous

systems, the identiﬁcation χ = 2zef f ε makes contact with the Flory-Huggins

theory[50].

In inhomogeneous systems, the eﬀective coordination number is

position dependent. As long as the ﬁnite range of interactions is neglected,

mean ﬁeld theory simply asserts that it is proportional to the local density of

(6)

(7)

monomers:

zi,ef f (~r) =

Ni,inter(~r)

ρi(~r) ∝

ρ(~r)

A more elaborated mean ﬁeld approach predicts for a system which is inho-

mogeneous in one direction y [57],

zef f ∝

ρ(y) +

where V (~r) is the integrable part of the interaction potential (i.e., excluding

the hard core part) and γ(~r) the normalized pair correlation function. Since

the interaction region extends no further than

the factor k2 is given by k2

Hence the expected deviation from the simple proportionality law (6) is of

order

2%. Furthermore, one would expect that the eﬀective coordination

number does not depend on whether a monomer belongs to a copolymer or a

≤

homopolymer.

In contrast to these considerations, the Monte Carlo data reveal a much

lower dip of the reduced coordination number zef f (y)/ρ(y) (Figure 9) at the

center of the interface. The discrepancy between mean ﬁeld assumption and

simulation data becomes even more manifest when looking at the number

18

of contacts NAB between A and B monomers. From the usual mean ﬁeld
assumption, one would expect NAB ∝
data however show that NAB/(ρAρB) is increased by a factor of 1.5, compared

ρB (Figure 10). The simulation

to the bulk value, at the distance of approximately two radii of gyration from

the interface, where the chains are stretched (cf. Figure 5). At the center of

the interface, on the other hand, it is decreased by 25%.

One can deduce that chains are compactiﬁed in the interfacial region. In-

terestingly, this holds particularly for copolymer chains. We recall that the

number of intrachain contacts in copolymers is enhanced at the interface,

whereas the interchain contacts are obviously suppressed. Thus copolymers

oﬀer relatively little “active surface” for interaction with external monomers in

the interfacial region. In contrast, the relative number of external contacts in-

creases further away from the interface. Hence the active surface per monomer

will presumably increase with the copolymer chain length. This may be an

additional reason why short copolymers are relatively poor amphiphiles.

3.4 Summary

We have studied the ternary system of A and B homopolymers and symmet-

ric AB diblock copolymers close to an A/B interface in the dilute regime,

where copolymer coils do almost not overlap with each other, by Monte Carlo

simulations of the bond ﬂuctuation model. In this regime, the structural prop-

erties of the interface are not altered with respect to the pure homopolymer

interface – in particular, we ﬁnd no signiﬁcant broadening of the interfacial

width, as is expected at higher copolymer concentrations. According to our

simulation results, copolymers resemble oriented dumbells with the A block

19

sticking into the A rich phase, and the B block sticking into the B rich phase.

The conformations of single blocks are not very diﬀerent from conformations

of pure homopolymer coils. Single blocks tend to orient themselves parallel

to the interface, like homopolymers, whereas copolymers as a whole are ori-

ented perpendicular to the interface. When looking at the orientations of single

bonds, we ﬁnd that the orientational properties of the central bond, which links

the two blocks, diﬀer distinctly from those of a homopolymer bond, but that

already the neighboring bonds behave very similar to homopolymer bonds.

Hence the chain loses the memory of the link very rapidly. Our results are

reproduced qualitatively, but not quantitatively, by a self consistent ﬁeld cal-

culation. Furthermore, we found that copolymers are unusually compact in

the interfacial region, i.e., monomers have more contacts to monomers of the

same chain, and fewer contacts to monomers of diﬀerent chains than monomers

in the bulk phase. As a result, the copolymer-copolymer interchain contacts

are particularly suppressed at the interface. This should become important as

the concentration of copolymers is increased. Future work will be concerned

with the structure of interfaces with higher content of copolymers and with

the transition between diﬀerent regimes, from the dilute to the wet brush to

the dry brush regime, until the two phase region breaks down and a lamellar

phase emerges.

three fourth of the chain (ρ1/4), and of all homopolymer monomers (ρh).

Also shown is the distribution of midpoints between the two ends of ho-

Abstract

Perturbative contributions to single-beam two-photon transition rates may be divided into two

types. The ﬁrst, involving low-energy intermediate states, require a high-order perturbation treat-

ment, or an exact diagonalization. The other, involving high energy intermediate states, only

require a low-order perturbation treatment. We show how to partition the eﬀective transition

operator into two terms, corresponding to these two types, in such a way that a many-body per-

turbation expansion may be generated that obeys the linked cluster theorem and has a simple

diagrammatic representation.

INTRODUCTION

Two-photon laser spectroscopy is an important complementary technique to linear spec-

troscopy because it has a diﬀerent parity selection rule, allows access to higher energy states,

and has a greater variety of possible polarization choices than linear spectroscopy.1 The cal-

culation of two-photon absorption for strongly correlated many-electron systems, especially

for rare earth ions in solids, dated back to Axe’s work in 1964.2 However, few quantita-

tive measurements of two-photon absorption were made until the early 1980’s.3 Extensive

measurements have been carried out thereafter.4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11 Most of these measurements

cannot be explained by Axe’s lowest-order calculations, and as a result, many calculations,

some using perturbation theory5,12,13,14,15,16,17 and some using full calculations in truncated

spaces,18,19 have been carried out to interpret the experimental results. Recently, we have

been able to explain the puzzling two-photon absorption intensities and polarization de-
pendences of Gd3+:LaF3 and Eu2+:CaF2 by full calculations in a truncated 4f N + 4f N −15d
space.19,20 However, these calculations cannot explain the two-photon absorption intensi-

ties of Sm3+, Eu3+ and Tb3+ doped in elpasolites.21,22,23 It appears that contributions from

high-order perturbations or high energy intermediate states must be considered.24

A systematic way to calculate properties of many-body systems is using eﬀective

Hamiltonians and operators. These techniques have been extensively developed in the

literature.25,26,27,28,29,30 The basic idea is to transform the exact time-independent (usually

many-body) Hamiltonian H into an eﬀective Hamiltonian Heﬀ acting on a restricted model

space of manageable dimension. The exact eigenvalues and model space eigenvectors (not

the exact eigenvectors) can be obtained by diagonalizing Heﬀ. For a time-independent oper-

ator O, such as a transition moment operator, an eﬀective operator Oeﬀ may be introduced

that gives the same matrix elements between the model space eigenvectors of Heﬀ as those

of the original operator O between the corresponding true eigenvectors of H.29 Although

the forms of Heﬀ and Oeﬀ are generally more complicated than, respectively, H and O, the

calculations based on Heﬀ and Oeﬀ have many advantages over variational and other direct

calculations based on H and O, such as smaller bases, less calculation eﬀort, order by order

approximations, and the calculation of all eigenvalues and transition matrix elements simul-

taneously for a multi-dimensional model space. More details on eﬀective operators can be

found in a recent paper of Duan and Reid29 and references therein.

2

Many-body perturbation theory (MBPT) may be used to expand eﬀective Hamiltoni-

ans and operators order by order. The calculations are often represented by Goldstone

diagrams.31,32 The linked cluster theorem25,32,33 implies that disconnected diagrams cancel

for eﬀective Hamiltonians and eﬀective operators, provided that the model space has been

carefully chosen and the model states have been properly orthogonalized. This cancellation

reduces the number of high order diagrams greatly and ensures size consistency. The linked

cluster theorem also holds for one-photon transition operators.25,29 However, the application

of MBPT to two-photon transitions is more diﬃcult than the case of one-photon transitions,

in that there are energy denominators in two-photon transition operators that contain both

the photon energies and exact electronic energies.17,34 Also, the intermediate states can be

any eigenstates of the system, including states in the model spaces containing initial and

ﬁnal states and other low excited states, making the energy denominators change drastically

and makes perturbative expansions for these intermediate states impossible.

In this paper, we explore the eﬀective operator method for two-photon transition calcu-

lations by combining exact calculations in a truncated space18,19 with perturbative methods

for the rest of the states.17,34 In section II we review the basic formalism for eﬀective operator

methods; In section III the partition of two-photon transition operator is given in detail;

Section IV presents the perturbation expansion that may be suitable for diagram repre-

sentation and applying linked cluster theorem. The diagram representation and diagram

evaluation rules and linked cluster theorem themselves for eﬀective two-photon transition

operator are highly nontrivial and will be presented in a followed paper.

II. BASIC FORMALISM

Most of the formalism required has been treated in detail in a monograph by Lindgren

and Morrison32 and more recently summarized by Killingbeck and Jolicard.30 The concept of

biorthogonal model space eigenvectors has been summarized by Duan and Reid.29 Here shall

only give a brief description of the formalism necessarily in the presentation that follows.

The time-independent Hamiltonian H is written as the sum of a model Hamiltonian H0

and a perturbation V

H = H0 + V.

(1)

Usually H0 is chosen in such a way that its eigenvalues and eigenvectors can be obtained

3

more easily than for H. For example, when H is the Hamiltonian for a many-body system,

H0 is usually chosen such that each particle moves independently in the average ﬁeld of

other particles and V denotes the remainder of H.

A complete set of orthonormal eigenvectors {|αi} and corresponding eigenvalues {Eα
0 }

for H0 are assumed to be available

A general model space P0, often referred to as a quasi-degenerate model space, is deﬁned as

the space spanned by d successive eigenvectors of H0 (not necessarily strictly degenerate).

The remaining part of the Hilbert space is called the orthogonal space Q0. Here we denote

the associated projection operators also as P0 and Q0:

be projected into the model space as d linearly independent functions |Ψα

It has been shown that d eigenvectors of the full Hamiltonian |Ψαi (α = 1, · · · , d) can usually
0 i in P0.27,35 The
wave operator ΩP is deﬁned as an operator that transforms all the d model functions back

into the corresponding exact eigenvectors.

Note that |Ψα

0 is are not necessarily eigenstates of H0, but a linear combination of those
eigenstates of H0 in P0. We shall call the space spanned by the d exact eigenvectors P . The
wave operator ΩP satisﬁed the ordinary Bloch equation36

[ΩP , H0] = (V ΩP − ΩP P0V ΩP )P0.

Usually the |Ψα

0 i are not orthogonal but are chosen to be normalized to unity. As a

consequence |Ψαi is not normalized to unity. Denote

H0|αi = Eα

0 |αi,

hα|βi = δαβ.

An eﬀective Hamiltonian Heﬀ acting on the model space, which gives the d exact eigen-

values and model eigenvectors upon diagonalizing, can now be deﬁned. Its form and eigen-

equation are

Heﬀ = P0HΩP P0 = P0H0P0 + P0V ΩP P0,

Instead of calculating ΩP directly from (8), the eﬀective Hamiltonian are usually calculated

via perturbation theory or phenomenological method and then diagonalized to give eigen-

III. PARTITION OF EFFECTIVE TRANSITION OPERATORS FOR SINGLE

BEAM TWO-PHOTON ABSORPTION

The perturbative expansion of a general two-beam two-photon transition rate has been

discussed by Duan and Reid34. Here we develop the perturbative expansion specialized for

the single-beam case. We will see that the calculation can be greatly simpliﬁed.

The line strength is proportional to the square modulus of following expression

Tf i =

hf |O|kihk|O|ii
Ei + ω − Ek
1
(Ef + Ei)/2 − H

= hf |O

O|ii.

where |f i (f ∈ F ), |ii (i ∈ I) and |ki(k ∈ F ∪ I ∪ K) are normalized exact eigenstates of

the systems, Ef , Ei, Ek are the corresponding exact eigenvalues, F , I are the set of ﬁnal

and initial states of the transition. K is the set of states of the system not included in

I and F . The intermediate eigenstates k can be any eigenstates of the system, including

eigenstates in the sets of initial and ﬁnal states. The calculation of Tf i can be divided into

two terms, a term T1 with “small” denominators, where k ∈ I ∪ F , and a term T2 with

“large” denominators, where k ∈ K. The operator can be formally written as

T = T 1 + T 2

T 1 =

Note that H F and H I are actually acting on the transition ﬁnal (on the leftmost) and

initial states (on the rightmost) and the equalities in (27) and (29) above are for notational

convenience.

Note that in this expression we use the exact eigenvalues and model space eigenvectors. The

matrix elements of the eﬀective operators are between states in spaces PF 0 and PI0 (which

may be the same). The matrix elements may be calculated from the eﬀective Hamiltonian

Heﬀ and eﬀective operator Oeﬀ.

The eﬀective operator for T2 can be formally written as

(31)

Once again, H F

eﬀ and H I

eﬀ act on the bra and ket model space respectively.

The space K includes all other states of the system than those limited number of states

in I and F . It is usually of inﬁnite dimension and the calculation of H K

eﬀ, Oeﬀ(F, K) and

Oeﬀ(K, I) is usually impractical or at least very tedious. Perturbative expansions giving in

the following section can be used to calculate T 2

eﬀ by an order-by-order approximation.

IV. PERTURBATIVE EXPANSION

Perturbative expansions of Heﬀ and Oeﬀ have been discussed in, for example, Refs. 32

and 29 by applying the Bloch equation iteratively. Here we expand T 2

eﬀ by perturbation
theory to avoid direct calculation of H eﬀ and Oeﬀ in model space K, which is usually of

inﬁnite dimension.

between eigenvectors of H0. The transition rates can then be calculated straightforwardly

from Eq.22 since the model space eigenvectors are assumed to have already been calculated

from Eq.11.

Terms of second order or higher in V can also be obtained straightforwardly. There are

about 20 second order terms but around 100 third order terms. Fortunately, with a suitable

partition of T into T 1 and T 2, usually only the zeroth and ﬁrst order terms of T 2 need to

be calculated, except when zeroth and ﬁrst -order terms become zero due to selection rules.

In such cases the number of nonzero second order terms is often greatly reduced.

V. CONCLUSION

A method to calculate single-beam two-photon absorption transition rates for many-

electron systems has been developed using eﬀective operator methods together with many-

body perturbation theory. In this method the contributions to two-photon transition oper-

ator are partitioned into two terms, one with small drastically varying denominators, which

is treated by doing an exact calculation in truncated spaces and the other with numerous

intermediate states and large energy denominators, which is treated systematically with

many-body perturbation theory. Compared to previous methods, the method presented

here has the accuracy of full calculation for contributions due to drastic-varying low-energy

intermediate states and the simplicity of low-order many-body perturbation theory for con-

tributions due to high energy intermediate states. It is also expected that there are linked

diagram representations for the order-by-order expansion.

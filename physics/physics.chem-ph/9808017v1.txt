A basis set of generalized nonspherical Gaussian functions (GGTOs) is presented and discussed.
As a ﬁrst example we report on Born-Oppenheimer energies of the hydrogen molecule. Although
accurate results have been obtained, we conclude that H2 is too ”simple” to allow for a substantial
gain by using nonspherical functions. We rather expect that these functions may be particularly
useful in calculations on large systems. A single basis set of GGTOs was used to simultaneously
calculate the potential energy curves of several states within each subspace of 1,3Σg,u symmetry. We
hereby considerd the entire region of internuclear distances 0.8 ≤ R ≤ 1000 a.u. In particular the
results for the fourth up to sixth electronic states show a high accuracy compared to calculations
which invoke explicitely correlated functions, e.g. the relative accuracy is at least of the order of
magnitude of 10

for the 6 3Σ+

I. INTRODUCTION

The usual method to obtain a molecular wavefunction is to expand this wavefunction in terms of products of linear
combinations of atomic orbitals respecting the spatial and spin symmetries and the Pauli principle. In order to limit
the computational expense a fast convergence of the calculation is desirable. The convergence essentially depends on
the choice of the atomic basis set. Slater-type functions (STOs) and Gaussian-type functions (GTOs) hereby have
gained large acceptance in quantum chemistry. Since computer evaluation of three- and four-center integrals over
STO basis functions is very time consuming, Boys? proposed in 1950 the use of GTOs instead of STOs. For GTOs
the integral evaluation requires much less computer time than for STOs. This results from the fact that three- and
four-center integrals over GTOs may be reduced to two-center-integrals.

The slow convergence of the calculations is the major drawback of using GTOs. On the one hand, GTOs provide a
poor description of the desired cusp of atomic orbitals for electrons located near the nucleus and the correlation cusp
for small interelectronic distances. On the other hand, GTOs are not well suited for describing electronic states with
distorted wavefunctions, e.g. for states involving high angular momenta. As a consequence, a linear combination of
several GTOs is necessary for an accurate representation of such a wavefunction.

A possible way of convergence improvement is to explicitely include the interelectronic distance in the wavefunction
which was introduced by Hylleraas? for the helium atom. For the hydrogen molecule the use of confocal elliptical
coordinates was introduced by James and Coolidge? and proved to be very eﬃcient. Further development on the
latter method was done by Kolos and Wolniewicz (see e.g. Refs. ?,? for accurate ground state energies) which lead
to theoretical energies for low lying electronic states of the hydrogen molecule with spectroscopic accuracy. However,
the use of basis sets with confocal orbitals is restricted to diatomic molecules and cannot be used in polyatomic
calculations.

Recently, a basis set of generalized GTOs? was introduced for calculations in the presence of external magnetic
ﬁelds. This basis set of generalized (nonspherical) Gaussian functions (GGTOs) proved to be an excellent choice
for calculations in strong magnetic ﬁelds. The ﬂexibility of the basis functions allows for an adaption of the basis
functions to the symmetry of the electronic wave function of the molecule which made the new GGTOs superior to
simple GTOs or STOs. In the presence of an external magnetic ﬁeld the wavefunction is, depending on the ﬁeld
strength, distorted towards a cylindrical symmetry. The obtained results for calculations on H +
2 and H2 in the
presence of magnetic ﬁelds (see Refs. ?,? and references therein) are very encouraging. This motivated the present
authors to raise the question whether this basis set may be also useful for calculations in ﬁeld free space. The ﬁrst part
of this paper deals with the presentation of the basis set and discusses brieﬂy the possible advantages GGTOs may
have in calculations on large systems. In the second part of this paper we report on a simple example: the investigation

1

of the electronic structure of the hydrogen molecule using GGTOs. A detailed knowledge of this simplest diatomic
molecule is of fundamental interest in diﬀerent branches of chemistry and physics. Fundamental molecular processes
can be studied, as , for example, charge exchange processes in H + + H − collisions , associative ionization reactions
H + H ∗ → H + H + + e−, excitation reactions H (1s) + H (1s) → H (1s) + H (2s) or H (1s) + H (2p) or chemical
exchange processes H + H2 → H2 + H. For a detailed understanding of the above mentioned processes one ﬁrst needs
accurate electronic energies for the hydrogen molecule. The investigations dealing with electronic states of H2 , both
experimentally and theoretically, are too numerous to be mentioned here. For an overview of experimental studies
we refer the reader to Refs. ?,? and references therein. In particular we mention an experiment recently reported by
Reinhold et.al.? where the outer minimum of the third excited 4 1Σ+
g state was investigated. For theoretical data on
the electronic structure of H2 see Refs. ?,?,?,?,?,? and references therein.

In the present investigation, a full CI approach is used to obtain the n 1,3Σ+

g,u n = 1 − 9 electronic states. Particular
emphasize was put on accurate results for the ﬁrst ﬁve excited states within each subspace of Σ symmetry, e.g. the
n 1,3Σ+
g,u n = 2−6 states. Our aim was to compute all of these states covering the entire range of internuclear distances
from R = 0.8 a.u to R = 1000 a.u with a single basis set of GGTOs. In the present investigation we report on accurate
Born-Oppenheimer energies of the third, fourth and ﬁfth excited 1Σ+
u states and of the ﬁfth excited 3Σ+

state. Born-Oppenheimer energies for the third excited 1Σ+
These results were obtained with the aid of a basis set not optimized for the state in question and could be further
improved. Excited 3Σ+
u states were investigated by Borondo et.al? but only with a very small basis set of GTOs and
at a few selected internuclear distances. To the best of the authors knowledge Born-Oppenheimer energies of the
51Σ+
g,u n = 1 − 6 H2
electronic states are compared with the best data found in the literature. As a side product of our calculations we
obtained electronic energies for the n 1,3Σ+
g,u n = 7 − 9 states which have not been investigated up to now. These
states are shown graphically but no energy data are provided.

II. GENERALIZED GAUSSIANS

The present computations were done with a basis set of generalized GTOs? which has been originally introduced in
order to perform calculation in the presence of an external magnetic ﬁeld. In the most general appearance the basis
functions in Cartesian coordinates read as follows:

φn (r; α, R, C) = exp [−iA (C) r] (x − Rx)nx (y − Ry)ny (z − Rz)nz
× exp h− (r − R)T α (r − R)i

r = (x, y, z)T denotes the vector of the electronic ccordinates and R = (Rx, Ry, Rz)T is the position vector charac-
terizing the center of the orbital. A (C) ist the vector potential at the position C, where C is a vector of variational
parameters which are determined by minimizing the expectation value of the energy. The gauge factor exp [−iA (C) r]
ensures the approximative gauge invariance of the energy expectation values. For our calculation on the H2 molecule
in the absence of a magnetic ﬁeld this phase factor vanishes. For a detailed discussion of the dependence of energy
expectation values on the choice of gauge we therefore refer the reader to Ref. ?. Without the additional gauge factor
needed in the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld this type of basis functions was ﬁrst introduced by Singer?. The matrix







is a real symmetric matrix of variational parameters which had to be optimized to minimize the energy expectation
value.

Basis functions of type (1) possess several advantages compared to GTOs. In order to describe wave functions
which diﬀer from a pure spherical symmetry the number of basis functions may be reduced. Contrary to GTOs the
ﬂexibility of basis functions of type (1) provide the possibility for an adaption of the basis functions according to
the symmetry of the molecule being investigated. Therefore a more rapid convergence with increasing size of the
basis set in energy calculations is expected when dealing with wavefunctions which signiﬁcantly diﬀer from a spherical
symmetry. The GGTO basis set can also be useful in calculations involving eﬀects as angular correlation. If GTOs
are used this leads, in particular for larger systems which involve high angular momenta, to a strong increase in the
size of the basis set. In that situation the use of GGTOs might be very useful: As a consequence of the nonspherical
shape, simple GGTOs contain portions of several diﬀerent angular momenta and may therefore reduce the number of

2

GTOs with high angular momenta signiﬁcantly. Despite the obvious advantages of the GGTO basis compared to the
GTO basis a main drawback is the evaluation of the matrix elements: The use of the GGTO basis requires a numerical
integration in the evaluation of three- and four-center matrix elements. Hereby three-center matrix elements can be
fastly evaluated but the evaluation of four-center matrix elements is time consuming. Consequently, for larger systems
a combination of GTOs and GGTOs seems to be useful. For a description of core and other localized electrons GTOs
are well suited since possible anisotropies in the wavefunction are small. GGTOs should be taken for a description of
outer electrons and the electrons participating in the chemical bond and/or in those cases where angular correlation
eﬀects are relevant.

As an example we considered the ground state of H2 1 1Σ+

g with a total energy at the equilibrium distance of
−1.1744757 a.u.? and investigated the inﬂuence of the anisotropy of the basisfunction with the aid of a (6s,3p,2d,1s)
basis set. The energy was obtained by an optimization of the parameters for the GTO and GGTO basis at the CI
level for H2. For the GTO basis we obtained an energy of −1.174006 a.u. at the equilibrium distance. The use of
anisotropic basis functions lead to an improved energy of −1.174086 a.u. The deﬁnition of the anisotropy a is as
follows: Let αxx ≤ αzz, so a := 1 − αzz
. The anisotropy for s-type functions is pretty small, e.g., between 0.01
αxx
and 0.05. However it increased for functions involving angular momenta not equal zero − for these type of functions
anisotropies up to 0.35 were calculated. Compared to the GTO basis, the use of GGTOs yielded 17 % of the remaining
energy to the exact result.

III. POTENTIAL ENERGY CURVES OF H2

For an investigation of the electronic structure of the hydrogen molecule the basis functions in Eq. (1) can be
simpliﬁed signiﬁcantly . Due to the cylindrical symmetry of the molecule we choose all oﬀ-diagonal elements of the
matrix α to be zero and in addition αxx equal to αyy. In this work we used only orbitals centered at the positions of
the nuclei. The origin of our coordinate system coincides with the midpoint of the internuclear axes and the protons
are located on the z-axis. Therefore, the basis functions used in the present investigation read as follows:

φn (r; αxx, αzz, ±R/2) = xnx yny (z ∓ R/2)nz exp n−αxx

x2 + y2

− αzz (z ∓ R/2)

For a detailed description of the evaluation of the various matrix elements needed in the computation of the wave-
function using this particular type of basis functions we refer the reader to Ref. ?.

In the present study Born-Oppenheimer energies were calculated for the lowest nine states within each of the Σ
subspaces, e.g., for both singlet and triplet as well as gerade and ungerade parity. Hereby particular emphasize
was put on accurate results for the n 1,3Σ+
g,u n = 2 − 6 states. A single basis set of GGTOs has been used for all
states and internuclear distances. The determination of the electronic potential energy curves (PECs) was done
by the following procedure: Since we would like to perform calculations for a large range of internuclear distances,
for 0.8 a.u. < R < 1000 a.u., we had to ensure obtaining correct energies in the dissoziation limit. Therefore,
i.e.
several GGTOs were optimized for electronic states of atomic hydrogen and included in the basis set. Second, a
limited number of basis functions for the description of angular correlation was optimized at a CI level at selected
internuclear distances. Following this procedure we arrived at a number of approximately 3800 two particle functions
at the full CI level of expansion. Most of these function were needed for the correct description of the dissociative
behaviour. The anisotropies in the s-type functions varies drastically. S-type functions involving high parameter
values (corresponding to electrons located near the nucleus) show an almost negligible anisotropy but functions with
small parameter values (necessary for the description of higher excited states) possess anisotropies up to 1. Basis
functions describing angular correlation may possess even larger distortions. In our calculations the maximum of
distortion was found to be 3.

In spite of the larger convergence error for energies of the n 1,3Σ+

g,u n = 7 − 9 states we graphically show the PECs
for these states. The relative error in the dissociation limit varies between 10−4 and 10−6 and is estimated to be of the
order of magnitude of 10−4 in the vicinity of the equilibrium internuclear distance. Our results represent the ﬁrst ab
initio data for these excited states. The results allow us, in particular, to demonstrate the interaction of the attractive
H + + H − states with H(1s) + H(nl) states at very large internuclear distances. For this purpose a large regime of
internuclear distances is necessary. The electronic energies were calculated at 480 diﬀerent internuclear distances in
the interval 0.8 a.u. < R < 1000 a.u. A complete table of the results can be obtained from the authors upon request.
The accuracy with respect to the energy data obtained in our investigation for states up to the ﬁfth excited ones is
estimated to be typically of the order of magnitude of 10−4 for 1 1Σ+
g,u n = 2 − 6
and n 3Σ+
g,u n = 1 − 6 states, respectively. The position of minima and maxima were determined with an accuracy of
10−2 a.u. of the internuclear distance.

A. The 1Σ+

g subspace

Many calculations have been performed on Born-Oppenheimer states within the 1Σ+

g subspace. Very accurate
g ) are given in Ref. ? and the lowest ﬁve excited states were considered in Ref.
energies for the ground state (1 1Σ+
?. A very detailed theoretical investigation of the 4 1Σ+
g was recently done by Wolniewicz? in order to explain the
experimental results by Reinhold et.al.? The calculations mentioned above served as a benchmark in the determination
of the accuray of our data. Our aim is the study of excited H2 states and the data concerning the ground state of the
hydrogen molecule is only a side product and less accurate than that for excited states. At the equilibrium internuclear
distance of the ground state we obtained an energy of 1.1742937 a.u. which implies an accuracy of 1.82 × 10−4 a.u.
g n = 2 − 6 states are in general at least as accurate as 5 × 10−5 a.u. or, equivalently, ≈ 11 cm−1
Our data for the n 1Σ+
compared to the results of Refs. ?,?. For some internuclear distances our calculations for higher excited states, e.g.
g state, yield energies slightly lower than those given in Ref. ?. The maximum diﬀerence in energy
the 4 1Σ+
amounts to 4.229 cm−1 at R = 2.00 a.u. (E = −0.63490478 a.u.) for the 4 1Σ+
g and 11.551 cm−1 at R = 2.80 a.u.
(E = −0.61390242 a.u.) for the 5 1Σ+
g state, respectively. These results indicate that a more accurate investigation
of these excited states is still posible which can be done by an optimization of the wavefunction for these particular
states.

The corresponding PEC was also included in Fig. 1. For the 4 1Σ+
g state its Born-Oppenheimer curve and the
PEC of H − was found to be very close? for internuclear distances 20 ≤ R ≤ 35.7. The diﬀerence between higher
excited states and the PEC of H − was not investigated up to now. The PEC of the 7 1Σ+
g state is for some range
of internuclear distances also very close to the PEC of H −. In particular we mention that the 7 1Σ+
g state exhibits a
very broad deep outer well with a total energy at the minimum of 0.555487 a.u. at large internuclear distances due
2
to the interaction with the H + + H − (1s)
conﬁguration. The depth of this well, e.g. the diﬀerence between the
maximum at R = 8.7 a.u. and the minimum at R = 33.7 a.u. approximately amounts to 0.015473 a.u. A series of
avoided crossings leads to the energetically equal dissociation limits of the n 1Σ+
g n = 7 − 9 states. The dissociation
limit of the 10 1Σ+

g state is the H + + H − (1s)

ion-pair conﬁguration.

B. The 1Σ+

u subspace

For a reference of the most accurate data on the electronic energies of the four lowest states of 1Σ+
u symmetry
we used the results given by Dressler and Wolniewicz?. In that investigation energies of the three lowest 1Σ+
u states
were presented with high accuracy. Our results show a relative accuracy of the order of magnitude of 10−4 for the
lowest and 10−5 for the ﬁrst and second excited state. Energies for the 4 1Σ+
u state however, were obtained in Ref.
? with the aid of a wavefunction optimized for the three lowest states. Therefore, these results are not optimal and
can be improved. Table I lists our ﬁrst time results on energy data for the fourth, ﬁfth and sixth excited 1Σ+
u state
at a few selected internuclear distances and a comparison of the present results with that of Ref. ? is given in Tab.
II. From Tab. II we observe that a substantial improvement of the energy data of Ref. ? was possible at relevant
54.87 cm−1
internuclear distances. Hereby the most signiﬁcant improvement of previous results
was obtained in the
(cid:1)
(cid:0)
vicinity of the (ﬁrst) internuclear equilibrium distance at R = 2.00 a.u. The PECs of the n 1Σ+
u n = 3 − 9 states are
graphically shown in Fig. 2. Similarly to the 1Σ+
g subspace we recognize the existence of two deep outer wells at large
2
g subspace this results from avoided crossings with the H + + H − (1s)
internuclear distances. As in the case of the 1Σ+
conﬁguration. For the 3 1Σ+
u state the existence of a second outer minimum was ﬁrst predicted by Dabrowski and
Herzberg? and theoretically shown by Kolos?. Our calculations revealed a broad and deep outer well of the 6 1Σ+
u
state which is located at 33.7 a.u. and possesses a total energy of −0.555492 a.u. The depth of the well, e.g., the
diﬀerence between the second minimum and the maximum of the 6 1Σ+

u state amounts to 0.015134 a.u.

4

C. The 3Σ+

g subspace

Detailed investigations of triplet states can be found for instance in Refs. ?,?,?. Recently energy data for triplet
states of H2 for small internuclear distances were calculated by Liu and Hagstrom? using full CI and large elliptical
basis sets. The results given by Liu and Hagstrom? and Kolos? served as the benchmark for our data for internuclear
distances R < 5 a.u. and R > 5 a.u., respectively. First, we notice that our results for the n 3Σ+
g,u n = 1−6 triplet states
(both gerade as well as ungerade symmetry) are roughly one order of magnitude more accurate than the corresponding
singlet states, e.g. the relative accuracy is of the order of magnitude of 10−5 or 10−6. An explanation herefore is that
for singlet states we deal with an electron cusp problem at r1 = r2 and therefore basis functions explicitely including
the interelectronic distance should show a much faster convergence in particular at small internuclear distances. This
cusp problem is absent for the triplet states. Furthermore, for triplet states correlation eﬀects are reduced due to
the Rydberg character of the states. As a consequence of our main goal - the accurate description of excited states -
our basis set contains several s-type functions but only a few functions explicitely involving higher angular momenta.
This further explains the better accuracy we have achieved for the triplet states.

For the four lowest 3Σ+

g states our results show an accuracy of the order of magnitude of 10−6 in the vicinity of
the equilibrium internuclear distance and in the dissociation limit and of 10−5 for intermediate internuclear distances,
e.g. 5 ≤ R ≤ 10 a.u. In this work we report for the ﬁrst time results of accurate energies for the 6 3Σ+
g state. The
corresponding data are given in Tab. III and the PECs are shown in Fig. 3. For the (5 3Σ+
g ) state a comparison of our
results with that of Refs. ?,? is presented in Tab. IV. For internuclear distances near the equilibrium conﬁguration
our energy data are slightly above that of Liu and Hagstrom but for larger distances slightly better than the best
previous results given in Ref. ?. Figure 3 indicates that the (7 3Σ+
g ) and
(5 3Σ+
g ) states) are nearly degenerate near the equilibrium internuclear distance. However, the energies for higher
excited states (n = 7 − 9) are not as accurate as those for the (4 3Σ+
g ) states and therefore a more detailed
study has to be performed in order to conﬁrm this result.

g ) states (similiar to the (4 3Σ+

g ) and (8 3Σ+

D. The 3Σ+

u subspace

For accurate energy data concerning the three lowest states of the 3Σ+

u subspace we refer the reader to Refs. ?,? and
references therein. A qualitative description of the six lowest 3Σ+
u states can also be found in the work by Borondo
et.al.? However, in that paper energy data for the six lowest 3Σ+
u states were obtained using a small GTO basis and the
energy data is therefore amenable to drastic improvement. Our results for the three lowest 3Σ+
u states show a typical
accuracy of 10−6 compared to the best data given in Refs. ?,?. For the 3 3Σ+
u state and some particular internuclear
distances the present calculations yield energies which are several tenths of cm−1 lower than those reported in Ref. ?.
Table V lists our energy data for the n 3Σ+
u n = 4 − 6 states. PECs are depicted in Fig. 4. In general our results are
of the order of magnitude of 10−3 or 10−2 lower than that given by Borondo?. Again, we draw the readers attention
to the series of avoided crossings originating from an interaction with an H + + H − (1s2s) ion pair conﬁguration?.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

In the ﬁrst part of the paper we presented a basis set of generalized Gaussian type functions. This basis set is well
suited for a description of distorted wave functions and angular correlation eﬀects. H2 has been investigated as a
ﬁrst test. For H2 the basis set works well, but may not justify the larger eﬀort involved in the use of nonspherical
functions. We rather expect this type of functions to be useful in larger systems.

We investigated the n 1,3Σ+

g,u n = 1 − 9 electronic states of the hydrogen molecule using one single basis set of
GGTOs. A broad range of internuclear distances (0.8 < R < 1000 a.u.) has been considered. Our main goal was the
calculation of accurate Born-Oppenheimer energies for the n 1,3Σ+
g,u n = 4 − 6 states. For the ﬁrst time we present
PECs for the n 1,3Σ+
u and the n 3Σ+
g,u n = 7 − 9 states. Energy data for the 4 1Σ+
u n = 4 − 6 were improved compared
to the best data available in the literature. New accurate PECs were calculated for the 51Σ+
g state.
The 7 1Σ+
g and the 6 1Σ+
u state were found to provide a second deep outer well arising due to an interaction with the
2
diabatic H + + H − (1s)
state. Similarly to the 4 1Σ+
g these states also may contain several long lived valence states
of H2 in analogy to what has been discussed in Ref. ?.

We propose a framework to construct the ground-state energy and density matrix of an N -electron
system by solving selfconsistently a set of single-particle equations. The method can be viewed as a
non-trivial extension of the Kohn-Sham scheme (which is embedded as a special case). It is based on
separating the Green’s function into a quasi-particle part and a background part, and expressing only
the background part as a functional of the density matrix. The calculated single-particle energies
and wave functions have a clear physical interpretation as quasiparticle energies and orbitals.

INTRODUCTION

The power of the Kohn-Sham (KS) implementation [1] of density functional theory (DFT [2]) lies in its ability to
incorporate complex many-body correlations (beyond Hartree-Fock) in a computational framework that is not any
more diﬃcult than the Hartree-Fock (HF) equations. In practice this means one has to solve single-particle Schr¨odinger
equations, with local or non-local potentials, in an iterative self-consistency loop. This simplicity makes KS-DFT the
only feasible approach in many modern applications of electronic structure theory. There is therefore continuing
interest, not only in developing new and more accurate functionals, but also in studying conceptual improvements
and extensions to the DFT framework.

The present implementations of DFT can handle short-range interelectronic correlations quite well, but often
fail when dealing with near-degenerate systems characterized by a small particle-hole gap. This seems to indicate
that KS-DFT does not accurately describe the Fermi surface if it deviates signiﬁcantly from the noninteracting
In this respect, one of the most glaring inadequacies of KS-DFT is the fact that the
one [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9].
physically important concept of quasiparticles is missing. Even formal knowledge of the exact exchange-correlation
energy functional would only lead to the total energy and the density, since the individual KS orbitals have no special
signiﬁcance. An exception is the HOMO orbital and energy which govern the asymptotic tail of the density. It has also
been observed numerically that in exact KS-DFT the occupied single-particle energies resemble the exact ionization
energies also for the deeper valence hole states [10, 11]; the deviations have been analyzed theoretically in terms of a
reponse contribution to the KS potential [11, 12].

Quasiparticle (QP) excitations in the Landau-Migdal sense[13, 14] form a well-known concept in many-body physics.
They are most readily understood as the relics of the single-particle (s.p.) excitations in the noninteracting system
when the interaction is turned on [15, 16]. In most electronic systems, or more generally in all normal Fermi systems,
the bulk of the s.p. strength (i.e. the transition strength related to the removal or addition of a particle) is concentrated
in QP states. Especially near the Fermi surface, the QP states represent the dominant physical feature and should
be described properly in any appropriate single-particle theory.

The QP orbitals form a complete, linear independent, but generally nonorthogonal set. The completeness and
linear independence follows from the fact that the QP states evolve from the set of single-particle eigenstates of a
noninteracting Hamiltonian. Near the Fermi surface they coincide with the electron attachment states or with the
dominant ionization states. Further away from the Fermi surface, QP states may acquire a width and correspond
not to a single state but to a group of states in the (N ± 1)-electron system characterized by rather pure one-hole or
one-particle structure. The QP states have reduced s.p. strength (i.e. the normalization of the QP orbitals is less than
unity). Note that QP orbitals and strengths (at least near the Fermi surface) are experimentally accessible using,
e.g., electron momentum spectroscopy [17].

It is the aim of the present paper to develop formally exact single-particle equations whose solutions can be
interpreted as the QP energies and orbitals, and to explore how approximations can be introduced by the modelling
of small quantities in terms of functionals. The resulting formalism will be called QP-DFT and yields, apart from the
QP orbitals and energies, also the total energy and the density matrix of the system.

To the best of our knowledge this is the ﬁrst time such a formalism, aiming directly at the quasiparticle properties,
is proposed. There are some similarities to the “correlated one-particle theory” as developed recently by Beste et
al. [18, 19], in that an energy-independent single-particle Hamiltonian is obtained whose eigenvalues are related
to ionization energies and electron aﬃnities. The interesting proposal in Ref. [18, 19] is to construct such a s.p.
Hamiltonian by means of a Fock-space coupled cluster expansion, separately in the N − 1 and N + 1 electron system,

and supplemented by a maximal overlap condition between the reference Slater determinant and the exact N electron
ground state (i.e. Brueckner coupled cluster). However, it is not obvious how the overcomplete set of Dyson orbitals
for the N − 1 electron system is reduced to N single-particle orbitals because the technique seems to require that in
general precisely N exact eigenstates of the N − 1 electron system are projected out as principal ionization states.
This may be problematic in cases where the s.p. strength is fragmented, or when considering the electron gas limit.
In our opinion, a general formulation should be expressed using the QP states and their associated width.

This paper is organized as follows. Sec. II reviews all necessary theoretical ingredients of the QP-DFT formalism.
The natural framework for discussing QP properties is the propagator or Green’s function (GF) formulation of
many-body theory [15, 16]. A summary of some GF results is therefore provided in Secs. II A-II B. See, e.g.,
[20, 21, 22, 23, 24] for reviews and general papers on the speciﬁc use of GF theory in electronic structure problems. In
Sec. II C the standard quasiparticle concept is introduced. The fundamental equations of the new QP-DFT formalism
are established in Sec. III A. A discussion of the main properties of QP-DFT is then provided in the remainder of
Sec. III, i.e. the embedding of both HF and KS-DFT, the potential exactness of the method, the asymptotic properties
in coordinate space, and the electron gas limit. The ﬁnal Sec. IV contains further discussion of QP-DFT (possible
implementations, advantages and drawbacks), and concludes with a summary of the paper.

II. GREEN’S FUNCTION THEORY AND THE QUASIPARTICLE CONCEPT

In this section some well-established results and concepts are reviewed, in order to introduce notation and to provide
an overview of the expressions needed for the QP-DFT formalism. The basic relations in GF theory can be found in
many textbooks, e.g. [15, 16]. In Sec. II C the quasiparticle concept as introduced in [13, 14] is discussed; this material
is also extensively treated in [16, 25, 26].

A. Single-particle propagator

We initially keep the discussion as general as possible, and consider a normal (non-superconducting) Fermi system
with Hamiltonian ˆH = ˆH0 + ˆV , where ˆH0 contains the kinetic energy and external potential and ˆV is the two-particle
interaction. The s.p. propagator in the energy representation is deﬁned as

in addition to calculate the total energy through the Migdal-Galitskii sum rule

which can be obtained by exploiting the fact that Trace[M (−)] = hΨN

propagator is suﬃcient for these purposes. However, only the (inverse of) the full propagator has a meaningful

mation for the selfenergy, but here the reasoning is in terms of the exact selfenergy. The latter plays the role of an
energy-dependent s.p. potential. For a discrete pole of the propagator, e.g., the amplitude obeys

In Fig. 1 the general diagrammatic structure of the selfenergy is shown. The two distinct types also correspond

in Eq. (19) is the sum of all static (energy independent) selfenergy contributions, and has the form of the HF mean

term in Fig. 1.

In normal Fermi systems, the bulk of the spectral strength is concentrated in quasiparticle (QP) states which, in the
Landau-Migdal picture, evolve adiabatically from the N ± 1 eigenstates of ˆH0, and can be regarded as the elementary

s.p. excitations in the interacting system. In its simplest form the QP contribution to the propagator can be written
as a modiﬁed noninteracting propagator,

E − ǫQj + iwQj

where wQj > 0 characterizes the width of the QP excitation at energy ǫQj, and zQj is the corresponding QP orbital.
The ﬁrst term in Eq. (20) corresponds to excitations in the (N − 1)-particle system, as indicated by the location of the
poles in the upper half-plane (ImE > 0). It contains the N lowest QP energies ǫQj (j = 1, .., N ), for which ǫQj < ǫF .
The higher QP states (j = N + 1, .., ∞) in the second term of Eq. (20) correspond to the (N + 1) system, as indicated
by the location of the poles in the lower half-plane (ImE < 0), and have ǫQj > ǫF .

According to Eq. (10), the spectral function corresponding to the QP propagator in Eq. (20) reads

[SQ(E)] =

(zQj)(zQj )†LwQj (E − ǫQj),

∞

Xj=1

where the (Breit-Wigner) distribution L∆(x) = ∆/π

x2+∆2 is normalized to unity and has width ∆.

The set of QP orbitals is complete and linearly independent (in view of the 1-1 correspondence to the noninteracting
system), but in general not orthogonal. The QP orbitals are diﬀerent from the HF ones because of the inclusion of
selfenergy contributions beyond HF (see second term in Fig. 1). This energy dependent part of the selfenergy is also
responsible for a reduction of the spectroscopic strength, z†

QjzQj ≤ 1.

For inﬁnite and homogenuous systems (e.g. the electron gas) the situation is particularly transparant, since all
matrix quantities are diagonal in a plane-wave basis, and reduce to continuous functions of s.p. momentum p. For
momenta close to the Fermi momentum (p ≈ pF ) the QP energy is the solution of ǫQ(p) = p2/(2m) + ReΣ(p; ǫQ(p)),
and coincides with the Fermi energy at pF , i.e. ǫQ(pF ) = ǫF . The spectral function S(p; E) is dominated by a sharp
QP peak at ǫQ(p), having a width wQ(p). The width wQ(p) is proportional to ImΣ(p; ǫQ(p)) and vanishes for p → pF .
While the QP excitations are only unambiguously deﬁned near the Fermi surface, the concept can be extended to all
momenta.

Similar considerations also apply to ﬁnite systems, where the QP excitation corresponds to a state or group of states
having rather pure s.p. character. The (N ± 1)-particle states near the Fermi energy (where no poles of the selfenergy
are present) are usually characterized by spectroscopic factors of the order of (but smaller than) unity. In closed-shell
atoms, e.g., the ﬁrst ionization state ΨN −1
(corresponding to the ﬁrst pole in the removal domain of the propagator)
typically has a spectroscopic factor of about 95% [27]. In that case the QP orbital in Eq. (20) coincides with the
Dyson orbital. More deeply bound orbitals may acquire a width, but have similar summed strength concentrated
near an average QP energy. The QP orbital in Eq. (20) is then representative for the transition amplitudes to these
states.

Note that the QP width does not contribute to the 0th and 1st moment, and drops out from all subsequent consid-

Finally, it should be noted that the simple ansatz in Eq. (20) does not provide a valid description of a QP excitation
j far away from the QP energy ǫQj. The energy-dependence in Eq. (21) can then be slightly misleading, as the tails
of the Breit-Wigner distribution extend beyond the Fermi energy. In reality the strength of a QP excitation either
belongs to the N − 1 or to the N + 1 system. The QP contribution to the separate [N (±)] and [M (±)] should therefore
not be determined directly by Eqs. (14,21), but rather by the location of the poles in the lower or upper halfplane,

III. QUASIPARTICLE EQUATIONS

A. Derivation of the QP-DFT equations

For the following it is important to realize that, given arbitrary hermitian matrices [NQ] and [MQ] with [NQ]
positive-deﬁnite, one can always write the unique decomposition of Eq. (22). This can be achieved by constructing
the unique basis that solves the (generalized) eigenvalue problem

[MQ]uj = λj[NQ]uj;

u†
j[NQ]uk = δj,k,

where [NQ] plays the role of a metric matrix; the QP energies and orbitals given by ǫQj = λj and zQj = [NQ]uj then
fulﬁll Eq. (22).

The eigenvalue problem in Eq. (25) can be considered as a set of s.p. equations determining the QP orbitals
and energies. We now rewrite the unknown operators [NQ] and [MQ] in a more useful form that suggests possible
approximation schemes.

Since the QP contribution to the spectral function is dominant, it makes sense to isolate it,

[S(E)] = [SQ(E)] + [SB(E)],

and concentrate on the residual small ’background’ contribution [SB(E)].
In fact, the full energy dependence of
[SB(E)] is not needed, since one can apply the quasiparticle-background separation of Eq. (26) to the zero’th and
ﬁrst energy-weighted moments as well, i.e. one has

[N ] = [NQ] + [NB];

[M ] = [MQ] + [MB],

where the total energy integrals [NB] = [N (−)
B ] can again be split in a removal
and addition part. Note that the matrices [N ] and [M ] on the left side of Eq. (27) are known in closed form through
Eqs. (18-19), so it follows that

B ] and [MB] = [M (−)

B ] + [M (+)

B ] + [N (+)

[NQ] = [I] − [NB],
[MQ] = [H0] + [ ˜VHF ] − [MB].

One then arrives at the remarkable conclusion that modelling the background contributions [M (±)

B ] as
a functional of e.g. the density matrix [N (−)], is suﬃcient to generate a selfconsistent set of s.p. equations. Using
Eqs. (28-29) the eigenvalue problem in Eq. (25) can be expressed as

B ] and [N (±)

([H0] + [ ˜VHF {N (−)}] − [MB{N (−)}])uj = λj ([I] − [NB{N (−)}])uj,

where the functional dependency of [MB] and [NB] is indicated between braces. Note that also the HF-like potential
[ ˜VHF ] is by deﬁnition [see Eq. (19)] expressed in terms of the density matrix, as indicated in Eq. (30).

Having an initial estimate for [N (−)] allows to construct the matrices [NB] and [MB], as well as the HF-like
potential [ ˜VHF ]. The eigenvalue problem in Eq. (30) can now be solved, yielding QP energies ǫQj = λj and orbitals
zQj = ([I] − [NB{N (−)}])uj. The N solutions with lowest energy represent excitations in the N − 1 system, and
should be used to update the density matrix [N (−)] = [N (−)

The above formalism, henceforth called quasiparticle DFT (QP-DFT), generates the total energy, the density
matrix, and the individual QP energies and orbitals, starting from a model for the background contributions [M (±)
B ]
and [N (±)
B ] as a functional of the density matrix. It is intuitively clear that this is a reasonable strategy: the external
potential appears directly in the QP hamiltonian [M ] − [MB] through the [H0] term of Eq. (19), and primarily
inﬂuences the position of the QP peaks. One may then assume the background part to be generated by ’universal’
electron-electron correlations, and to be a good candidate for modelling. Equation (30), determining the QP energies
and orbitals, is the central result of the present paper, and its properties will now be discussed in detail.

B. HF and KS-DFT as special cases of QP-DFT

We ﬁrst show that both HF and KS-DFT theory are included in the general QP-DFT treatment.
B ] and [N (±)
For HF this is rather obviously achieved by setting all background quantities [M (±)

B ] equal to zero in
Eq. (30). Since the metric matrix on the right of Eq. (30) is now simply the identity matrix, one has zQj = uj and
the QP orbitals form an orthonormal set obeying ([H0] + [ ˜VHF ])zQj = ǫQjzQj. The matrix [ ˜VHF ] is given by Eq. (19)
where the density matrix [N (−)] in the present approximation follows from Eq. (31) with [N (−)

B ] = 0, i.e.

One can see that [M ] = [H0] + [ ˜VHF ] is just the ordinary HF hamiltonian, and the total energy obtained from Eq. (32)
by setting [N (−)

B ] = [M (−)

B ] = 0,

The KS-DFT case is somewhat more diﬃcult, but one also starts by setting [N (±)

([H0] + [ ˜VH ] + [ ˜VF ] − [MB])zQj = ǫQjzQj.

Here the HF-like potential has been split into its direct and exchange components, [ ˜VHF ] = [ ˜VH ] + [ ˜VF ]. As the
density matrix is again given by Eq. (33), both components only receive contributions from the occupied (j = 1, .., N )
orbitals zQj:

P

B ] and [M (±)

One concludes that the QP-DFT formulation is ﬂexible enough to reproduce HF or KS-DFT results by speciﬁc
choices of [N (±)
B ] = 0
would normally imply the absence of a background contribution to the ﬁrst-order moment [M (±)
B ] as well. A similar
situation is encountered in Brueckner-Hartree-Fock theory[28], in which the real part of the selfenergy causes a shift in
the QP energy, but the corresponding reduction of strength through the imaginary part of the selfenergy is neglected.

B ]. Note that the KS-DFT formalism is embedded in a slightly tortuous way, as [N (±)

It should be clear that GF quantities like the propagator, spectral function, or selfenergy, are well-deﬁned and can
in principle be calculated exactly. Also the separation of the spectral strength into QP and background parts can be

C. Potential exactness

performed for any system. In fact, deﬁning the QP part can usually be done in several ways which are all, however,
equivalent at the Fermi surface. Note that the density matrix and the total energy only contain the 0th and 1st
energy-weighted moment [N (−)] and [M (−)], and do not depend on the QP-background separation. As long as one
sticks to one unique prescription, the QP orbitals and energies are well-deﬁned quantities, and so are the background
contributions [N (±)

B ]. The fundamental expressions in Eq. (30-32) are therefore always valid.

B ] and [M (±)

As an example of an unambiguous deﬁnition of QP excitations one can e.g., in the spirit of Landau-Migdal theory,

consider the lowest order expansion of the selfenergy around ǫF :

[Σ(E)] = [Σ(ǫF )] + (E − ǫF )[Σ′(ǫF )],

where [Σ′(E)] is the ﬁrst derivative of the selfenergy with respect to energy. For inﬁnite homogenuous systems the
right side of Eq. (47) is a real function, since ImΣ(p, E) = ∂
∂E ImΣ(p, E) = 0 at the Fermi energy E = ǫF . In a ﬁnite
system the right of Eq. (47) is an hermitian matrix, since [Σ(E)] = [Σ(E)]† in a ﬁnite pole-free interval around the
Fermi energy. Substituting the linearized selfenergy (47) into Eq. (9) leads to

([H0] + [Σ(ǫF )] − ǫF [Σ′(ǫF )])u = E([I] − [Σ′(ǫF )])u,

deﬁning the QP excitations. Note the formal similarity to Eq. (30), and the fact that the metric matrix is positive-
deﬁnite as [Σ′(ǫF )] is a negative-deﬁnite hermitian matrix. While Eq. (48) results in a correct description for E ≈ ǫF ,
it may not be appropriate away from the Fermi surface, when the linear approximation (47) breaks down.

It should be stressed that the possibility of deﬁning QP excitations in various ways is not a shortcoming of the
present approach, but rather a reﬂection of the physical reality that QP excitations are only unambiguously deﬁned
near the Fermi surface, where the density of states in the N ± 1 system is small. The complete description of the
s.p. properties in an interacting many-body system is contained in the energy dependence of the spectral function.
Any eﬀective s.p. Hamiltonian can at most describe the peaks in the spectral function, i.e. identify the energy regions
where the s.p. strength is concentrated and assign an average transition amplitude to this region.

Finally we should explain the use of the density matrix as the independent variable for the functional modelling of
[N (±)
B ] and [M (±)
B ] in Eq. (30). In the present context it seems most natural to do this in terms of a matrix quantity.
Moreover, for the class of systems with ﬁxed two-body interaction ˆV and varying nonlocal external potentials (i.e.
varying ˆH0), the fundamental theorem of density matrix functional theory [29] implies that all quantities can be
expressed as functionals of the density matrix. This holds in particular for the [N (±)
B ], once a unique
prescription is agreed upon.

B ] and [M (±)

It is of course also possible to consider the electron density ρ as the basic variable, provided one restricts oneself
to the class of systems with local external potentials. In that case one is again formally assured of the existence of
functionals for all quantities. Note that the functional in Sec. III B reproducing the KS-DFT results, even when the
exact KS functional is used, is not the exact QP-DFT functional since it does not yield the correct density matrix;
the exact QP-DFT functional would deﬁnitely have [N (±)
B ] 6= 0.

D. Asymptotics in coordinate space for ﬁnite systems

For notational convenience the spin dependence is dropped here.

In coordinate space the background quanti-
B (r, r′) represent nonlocal operators, as they have a ﬁnite trace. The complete background

B (r, r′) and M (−)

ties N (−)
operators NB(r, r′) and MB(r, r′) can be local or nonlocal.

It seems plausible that the background operators are short-ranged in the sense that correlation eﬀects should become
insigniﬁcant at large distances. I.e. the limit |r| → ∞ of the background operators should drop out when considering
the asymptotic behavior of the quasiparticles in Eq. (30). This requires for |r| → ∞ that

implementations are also possible. For [MB] one requires that for |r| → ∞,

With the characteristics (49-50) of the exact QP-DFT functional, the background operators simply drop out of the

asymptotic behavior of Eq. (30), and one is left with (for an external charge Z)

Note that, for |r| → ∞, one has zQi(r) = ui(r) since the metric matrix [I] − [NB] becomes the identity by virtue
of Eq. (49). The Hartree term gives rise to the N/r potential, and only the Fock term built with the N lowest QP
orbitals needs further analysis. In fact, one immediately sees that the behavior of the Fock term is the same as the
one studied in Ref. [31] (or more generally in Ref. [30]). The asymptotic expansion

where PL is a Legendre polynomial and ω the angle between r and r′, can be substituted in the Fock term of Eq. (51).
The ﬁrst (L = 0) term in Eq. (52) then only contributes in case of removal-type (i = 1, .., N ) QP orbitals, since [see
Eq. (25)]

and eﬀectively changes the asymptotic charge to Z − N + 1. A similar analysis as in Ref. [30] then proves that the
removal QP orbital with the slowest decay is the HOMO one (i = N ), and goes like ∼ e−αrrβ with α2 = −2ǫQN and
β = (Z − N + 1)/α. The Fock term imposes the same exponential decay (except in very special cases) on the other
removal QP orbitals, but with an accompanying power law that decreases faster by at least 1/r2.

For the addition-type (i = N + 1, .., +∞) QP orbitals the ﬁrst term in Eq. (52) does not contribute to the Fock
term in Eq. (51), and the asymptotic charge remains Z − N . This means that for neutral atoms no Rydberg sequence
of bound addition-type QP orbitals is present, which is in agreement with the real physical situation. Also note that,
unlike HF, the presence of the [MB] term in Eq. (30) does allow for the possibility that some addition-type QP orbitals
become bound for neutral systems. The asymptotics of the bound addition-type QP orbitals is again correct, with an
exponential decay governed by their individual separation energies ǫQi. They go like ∼ e−αrrβ with α2 = −2ǫQi and
β = (Z − N )/α; the Fock term in Eq. (51) cannot inﬂuence this, since all removal-type QP orbitals decay faster.

E. The electron gas limit

We consider for simplicity the spin-unpolarized electron gas at density ρ, and suppress the spin indices. To ﬁnd
B ] quantities one needs the momentum distribution n(p) and the removal

B ] and [N (±)

the electron gas limit of the [M (±)
energy r(p), deﬁned as

n(p) = hΨ0|a†

pap|Ψ0i; r(p) = hΨ0|a†

p[ap, ˆH]|Ψ0i.

The QP-background separation can be made once a QP spectrum ǫQ(p) and strength ZQ(p) is deﬁned. Near the
Fermi surface the standard deﬁnitions

ǫQ(p) = p2/(2m) + ReΣ(p; ǫQ(p)); ZQ(p) = 1/(1 −

∂ReΣ(p; E)
∂E

)E=ǫQ(p)

are valid. For momenta far from pF Eq. (55) may break down, e.g. the equation deﬁning ǫQ(p) may have multiple
roots, or the strength ZQ(p) may become larger than unity. An alternative deﬁnition, valid for all momenta, must
then be used. For an example of such a procedure we refer to [32], where the QP-background separation was made in
the context of a GW description [33, 34] of the electron gas.

The background quantities in the electron gas are now expressed as

N (−)
M (−)

B (p) = n(p) − θ(pF − p)ZQ(p); N (+)
B (p) = r(p) − θ(pF − p)ZQ(p)ǫQ(p); M (+)

B (p) = 1 − n(p) − θ(p − pF )ZQ(p)

B (p) = p2/(2m) + ˜VF (p) − r(p) − θ(p − pF )ZQ(p)ǫQ(p),

(56)

where ˜VF (p) is the Fock-like potential (evaluated with the exact momentum distribution n(p)). The typical behavior
of these background quantities as a function of momentum can be found in Fig. 1 of Ref.[32].

For the purpose of applying the electron gas results to inhomogenuous systems, it is not a priori clear what the
equivalent of the Local Density Approximation would be. Working with the Wigner transform would seem the most
straightforward,

IV. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION

The concept of quasiparticles is an important tool to understand and describe normal Fermi systems. In this paper
we developed a set of single-particle equations whose solutions correspond to the QP orbitals and energies. When
the residual small background contributions are expressed as universal functionals of the density or density matrix, a
single-particle selfconsistency problem (the QP-DFT scheme) is generated that can be easily solved for an approximate
choice of the functionals.

The QP-DFT scheme would seem to oﬀer many advantages as compared to KS-DFT. There is no need for the
diﬀerence between the kinetic energy of the interacting systems and a reference system. All s.p. orbitals and energies
have physical meaning, in contrast to the KS orbitals. The asymptotic behavior of the QP orbitals comes out correct,
provided the background operators are short-ranged. On the down side: since we no longer have a sharp Fermi
surface, particle-number conservation is not automatically guaranteed, and should be built into the functionals.

The fact that KS-DFT is built in as a special case is a very important feature of QP-DFT. In a sense, one cannot
do worse than KS-DFT, since one adds more parameters to the model. Moreover, the new parameters are truly new
degrees of freedom (the introduction of the metric matrix, allowing a softening of the Fermi surface), which cannot
be mimicked by taking a more sophisticated KS functional.
B ], [M (±)

B ] is basically virgin territory. One option would be to
B ], adding a similar
B ], and (re)parametrize by ﬁtting to total energies and ionization energies in a training set of atoms and

exploit the relation (46) with the KS formalism, using an existing XC functional form for [M (±)
form for [N (±)
molecules.

The modelling of the background operators [N (±)

Alternatively, one could devise parametrizations by performing GF calculations on a series of test systems, and
construct the background operators directly from the calculated spectral function. A step in this direction was taken
in Ref. [35], where we applied an ab-initio selfenergy of the G0W0 type to a series of closed-shell atoms. The QP-
DFT scheme outlined in the present paper was used in ﬁrst iteration (no selfconsistency) to generate the ﬁrst-order
corrections to the HF picture. We then constructed a simple QP-DFT functional that depends only on HF quantities,
but was able to reproduce the most important results of the underlying ab-initio model.

Abstract

In calculations of heavy-atom molecules with the shape-consistent Relativistic
Eﬀective Core Potential (RECP), only valence and some outer-core shells
are treated explicitly, the shapes of spinors are smoothed in the atomic core
regions and the small components of four-component spinors are excluded
from calculations. Therefore, the computational eﬀorts can be dramatically
reduced.

However, in the framework of the standard nodeless radially local RECP
versions, any attempt to extend the space of explicitly treated electrons more
than some limit does not improve the accuracy of the calculations. The errors
caused by these (nodeless) RECPs can range up to 2000 cm−1 and more for the
dissociation and transition energies even for lowest-lying excitations that can
be unsatisfactory for many applications. Moreover, the direct calculation of
such properties as electronic densities near heavy nuclei, hyperﬁne structure,
and matrix elements of other operators singular on heavy nuclei is impossible
as a result of the smoothing of the orbitals in the core regions.

In the present paper, ways to overcome these disadvantages of the RECP
method are discussed. The developments of the RECP method suggested
by the authors are studied in many precise calculations of atoms and of the
TlH, HgH molecules. The technique of nonvariational restoration of elec-
tronic structure in cores of heavy atoms in molecules is applied to calculation
of the P, T -odd spin-rotational Hamiltonian parameters including the weak
interaction terms which break the symmetry over the space inversion (P ) and
time-reversal invariance (T ) in the PbF, HgF, BaF, and YbF molecules.

I. INTRODUCTION

The Dirac-Coulomb (DC) Hamiltonian which is used for calculation of heavy atoms and

heavy-atom molecules has the form (e = me = ¯h = 1):

HDC = Xi

hD(i) +Xi>j

1
rij

,

(1)

where the one-electron Dirac operator hD is

hD = −ıc(~α · ~∇) + c2(β − 1) + Vnuc ,

~α, β are the 4 × 4 Dirac matrices, c is the speed of light and Vnuc is the nuclear potential
which can take account of eﬀect of ﬁnite nuclear size etc.

Higher approximation levels involve modifying the instantaneous Coulomb interaction be-
tween electrons. These modiﬁcations are derived from the Quantum ElectroDynamic (QED)
theory. The simplest approximation is obtained by including the one-photon exchange. In
the Coulomb gauge it leads to so-called Dirac-Coulomb-Breit (DCB) Hamiltonian (see, e.g.,
[1])

HDCB = HDC + Bij ,

(2)

where

Bij(ωij) = Xi>j

[−(~αi · ~αj)

cos(ωijrij)

rij

+ (~αi · ~∇i)(~αj · ~∇j)

cos(ωijrij) − 1

ω2

] ,

and ωij denotes the transition frequency between the electrons i and j.

A low-frequency expansion of the cosines yields the incomplete Breit interaction Bij(0):

Bij(0) = −

1
2

[~αi · ~αj + (~αi · ~rij)(~αj · ~rij)/r2

ij]/rij .

These terms describe the instantaneous magnetostatic interaction and retardation in the
electric interaction between electrons.

In calculations on heavy-atom molecules, the DC and DCB Hamiltonians are usually

replaced by an eﬀective Hamiltonian

HEf = Xiw

[hSchr(iw) + UEf (iw)] + Xiw>jw

riwjw

,

(3)

written only for valence and some outer core electrons denoted by indices iw and jw; UEf
is an Relativistic Eﬀective Core Potential (RECP) operator simulating interactions of the
explicitly treated (“pseudo-valence”) electrons with those which are excluded from the RECP
calculation. In Eq. (3), hSchr is the nonrelativistic one-electron Schr¨odinger operator

hSchr = −

~∇2 + Vnuc ,

Contrary to the four-component (relativistic) wave function used in DC(B) calculations, the
pseudo-wave function in the RECP case can be both two- and one-component.

II. FEATURES OF SHAPE-CONSISTENT RECPS

The RECP approximations with the radially local operator for “shape-consistent” (or
“norm-conserving”) pseudoorbitals (pseudospinors) [2–4] are the most widely used in modern
calculations of molecules with heavy elements. Below we discuss mainly these RECP versions
and their developments because they provide the largest computational savings for the same
level of accuracy as compared with other RECP versions.

A. Advantages

• Chemically inactive electrons are excluded from RECP calculations.

• The valence orbitals (spinors) are smoothed in the core regions of heavy atoms to
generate nodeless pseudoorbitals (pseudospinors). Therefore, the number of the one-
electron basis functions may be minimized, thus reducing dramatically both the num-
ber of two-electron integrals and the computational time.

• The small components of four-component spinors are eliminated and the nonrelativistic
kinetic energy operator is used. The RECP method allows one to use a well-developed
nonrelativistic technique of calculation and relativistic eﬀects are taken into account
with the help of spin-dependent semilocal potentials. As a result, the most part of
diﬃculties inherent for the DC(B) molecular calculations can be avoided.

• In principle, correlations of the explicitly treated electrons with those which are ex-
cluded from the RECP calculation can be considered within “correlated” RECP ver-
sions. Reducing the number of explicitly correlated electrons with the help of the
correlated RECPs is a very promising way to minimize eﬀorts when performing high-
precision molecular calculations.

B. Disadvantages

• By now, diﬀerent schemes of the RECP generation are suggested which use the radially
local operator for the eﬀective potential. However, as it was demonstrated in many
test calculations, they provide the comparable level of accuracy for the same number
of the explicitly treated electrons.

It is clear that the explicit inclusion of the outer core electrons into the RECP calcula-
tion is the way to increase the computational accuracy. However, the extension of the
space of these electrons more than some limit does not improve the accuracy as is ob-
tained in all our atomic calculation with RECPs and PPs. Although the errors caused
by the nodeless RECP approximations can be small enough in competent treatments,
they still range up to 2000 cm−1 and more for the dissociation and transition energies
even for lowest-lying excitations that can be unsatisfactory in many applications.

One can conclude that the scheme of smoothing and the number of the explicitly
treated electrons are not only responsible for reﬁning the accuracy of the RECP cal-
culations.

3

• The reliability of the radially local RECP versions is not high for transitions with exci-
tations from the outer core shells, for the chemistry of transition, rare-earth elements,
etc.

• Moreover, the direct calculation of such properties as electronic densities near heavy
nuclei, hyperﬁne structure, and matrix elements of other operators singular on heavy
nuclei is impossible as a result of the smoothing of the orbitals in the core regions of
heavy elements.

To overcome these disadvantages of the shape-consistent RECP method, a few develop-
ments were done by the authors concerning the RECP operator ﬁrst of all [5–9]. A detailed
theoretical analysis of the RECP method is presented in [9].

C. Historical background of RECP method

Some of the most important achievements in the development of the eﬀective core po-

tential (or pseudopotential) theory are listed below:

• The ﬁrst ideas and papers devoted to the PseudoPotential (PP) theory of Hellmann

(1935) [10] and Gombas (1935) [11] were published more than 60 years ago.

• The procedure of treatment of the valence electrons in the frozen sea of core electrons

was suggested by Fock et al. [12] in 1940.

• The smoothing of orbitals in atomic cores was suggested and the orbital angular mo-
mentum (l) dependence of the PP operator for the case of pseudoorbitals smoothed
in the cores was ﬁrst emphasized in the pioneering paper of Phillips & Kleinman
(1959) [13].

• The PP operator with the angular projectors was used ﬁrst by Heine and Abarenkov
(1964, 1965) [14] to generate one-electron model potentials mainly for the solid-state
calculations.

• Improvement of the PP accuracy when treating several valence electrons explicitly was

suggested by Weeks & Rice [15] in 1968.

• Goddard III suggested a scheme (1968) [16] for the generation of the radially local
eﬀective potentials on the base of inverting the atomic Hartree-Fock (HF) equations.

• The ab initio radially local eﬀective potentials were eﬃciently applied by Kahn et al.

(1976) [17] to molecular calculations.

• The nonrelativistic shape-consistent ECP was suggested by Durand & Barthelat (1975)

[2]. Christiansen et al. (1977) [3] have modiﬁed their smoothing scheme.

• The Relativistic ECP method for two-component atomic pseudospinors was proposed

by Lee et al. (1977) [4].

4

• Hafner & Schwarz (1979) [18] have split the RECP operator on the spin-independent
and spin-orbit parts that allowed one to take into account the spin-orbit interaction
only at the ﬁnal stage of a calculation thus reducing computational eﬀorts.

D. Notations

Below we shall use the following notations for the principal quantum numbers n of
orbitals: nf for the inner core (IC) orbitals, nc for the outer core (OC) orbitals, nv for
the valence (V) orbitals, and na for the virtual (A) orbitals. The quantum numbers of the
orbital momentum, total momentum, and its projection will be designated by the l, j, and
m indices, respectively. We shall write one-electron states as

for the pseudospinors and as

eψnljm(τ ) = eϕnlj(r)χljm(Ω, σ)
Qnlj(r) iχl′jm(Ω, σ)!
ψnljm(τ ) =   Pnlj(r) χljm(Ω, σ)

for the four-component spinors where

l′ = 2j − l,

τ ≡ (~r, σ) ≡ (r, Ω, σ),

eϕnlj are the radial parts of the pseudospinors, Pnlj and Qnlj are the radial parts of the large

and small components of the Dirac spinors, and χljm is the two-component spin-angular
function.

We shall assign an orbital to the OC or V subspaces using the average radius criterion
rather than the orbital energy criterion. The diﬀerence in such a deﬁnition is essential mainly
for transition metals, lanthanides and actinides in which orbitals with diﬀerent principal
quantum numbers may have close orbital energies. For the problems of the RECP generation
and application, which we are going to discuss, the space criterion is more appropriate.

III. GRECP OPERATOR

Following basically the scheme developed by K. Pitzer’s group (Lee et al. [4], Chris-

tiansen et al. [3]), the numerical pseudospinors eϕnlj(r) are constructed of the large compo-

nents Pnlj(r) of the outer core and valence Dirac-Fock (DF) spinors so that the innermost
pseudospinors of them (for each l and j) are nodeless, the next pseudospinors have one node,
and so forth:

eϕnlj(r) =( Pnlj(r),

f (r) = rγP5

r ≥ Rc,
i=0 airi, r < Rc,

(4)

l = 0, 1, . . . , L,

j = |l ± 1

2|, n = nc, n′

c, . . . , nv,

5

where L is one more than the highest orbital angular momentum of the IC spinors. The
leading power γ in the polynomial is typically chosen to be close to L in order to ensure a
suﬃcient ejection of the pseudovalence electrons from the IC region.

To derive the GRECP components Unlj(r), the HF equations are inverted for the V and

OC pseudospinors (for each l = 0, . . . , L and j = |l ± 1
nonrelativistic-type HF equations in the jj-coupling scheme for a “pseudoatom” with the
removed IC electrons (Goddard III, 1968) [16]

with the pseudospinors, εnlj is the one-electron energy of the corresponding spinor, and εn′nlj
are the oﬀ-diagonal Lagrange multipliers.

where Z is the nuclear charge, eJ and fK are the Coulomb and exchange operators calculated
In general, diﬀerent potentials Unlj are obtained for diﬀerent pseudospinors eϕnlj with the

help of Eq. (5). It is necessary to construct such an RECP operator which would act on each
individual pseudospinor as the corresponding potential. This operator may be presented in
the non-Hermitean (right-handed) form as:

where

UEf = Xn

i.e., | gnljmih gnljm| is the projector on the ˜ψnljm pseudospinor and the n index runs over the

OC, V, and A pseudospinor subspaces. The direct use of expression (6) in calculations is
impossible because it includes the inﬁnite summations on the n and l indices.

The Unlj potentials contain the contribution from the Coulomb and exchange interac-
tion with the IC electrons, the contribution from smoothing the spinors, and the contribu-
tion from relativistic eﬀects as a result of the replacement the Dirac Hamiltonian by the
nonrelativistic-type Hamiltonian.
With the help of the property

h ˜ϕnlj|Unlj − Un′lj| ˜ϕn′lji = 0,

(7)

when neglecting small terms, the operator (6) (Generalized RECP or GRECP operator) can
be written in the Hermitian form:

is the ordinary spin-angular projector and the ﬁrst line in Eq. (8) presents the standard
radially local RECP operator. It can be shown [9] that the action of this operator on the
OC, V, and A pseudospinors is equivalent (with the required accuracy) to the action of the
corresponding potentials on them.

Note that the nonlocal terms with the projectors on the most important correlating
functions ˜ϕcorr
nklkj(r) localized mainly in the OC and V regions and with the corresponding
potentials, Unklkj(r), in principle (i.e. in the cases in which it is essential), can be taken into
account in the expression for the GRECP operator additionally to the terms with the OC

projectors ePnclj.

[18]:

With the help of the following identities for the Plj projectors (Hafner & Schwarz, 1979)

the GRECP operator can be easily written in the spin-orbit representation.

A. Calculations of Hg and Pb

The accuracy of the GRECP approximation was tested in correlation structure calcu-
lations of the Hg and Pb atoms in which we were able to use very ﬂexible basis sets. The
all-electron Fock-space Relativistic Coupled Cluster (RCC) method has been described in
review [19] and its references. RECP errors in reproducing the all-electron RCC transi-
tion energies in Hg for the case of 20 correlated electrons and the equivalent correlation
[7, 9, 8, 6, 7, 7] basis sets (for all-electron and RECP calculations, see [20]) are presented in
Table I (compiled from [20]). The highest absolute error in reproducing the transition ener-
gies with excitation or ionization of single electron is 94 cm−1 for the GRECP [6], 729 cm−1
for the RECP of Ross et al. [21] and 1747 cm−1 for the energy-adjusted PP [22]. The same
number of electrons, twenty, is explicitly treated in all these RECP versions. The larger
errors for RECPs [21] and [22] are mainly due to the neglect of the diﬀerence between the
outer core and valence potentials in these RECP versions (see [6,9] for more details).

7

Calculations of transition energies in the Pb atom are performed for ﬁve lowest-lying
states in [23] (see Table II here) by the four-component [24] and two-component (with
GRECP) [25] versions of the combined method of the Conﬁguration Interaction (CI) and
the second-order Many-Body Perturbation Theory (MBPT2) [24]. The 22e-GRECP version
for Pb [6] was tested and very good agreement of the GRECP/MBPT2/CI calculations with
the four-component DC/MBPT2/CI results is obtained.

IV. FROZEN CORE APPROXIMATION FOR OUTER CORE SHELLS

To perform precise calculations of the chemical and spectroscopic properties, the cor-
relations should be taken into account not only within the valence regions of heavy atoms
and heavy-atom molecules but within the core regions and between the valence and core
electrons as well. In practice, the goal is to achieve a given level of accuracy correlating as
small a number of electrons as possible, thus reducing the computational eﬀort. However,
the performance of the RECPs generated for a given number of explicitly treated electrons
can not always satisfy the accuracy requirements of the correlation structure calculation.

It can be illustrated on example of Tl [26]. To attain a good accuracy, e.g., within 400
cm−1 for a group of low-lying states of molecules containing Tl, one should correlate at least
13 electrons of Tl (i.e., including the 5d shell) and it would be optimal to use the RECPs
with this number of electrons treated explicitly (i.e., 13e-RECP) like the RECP of Ross
et al. [21] or our valence RECP version [6]. However, all the known nodeless 13e-RECPs
cannot ensure the above-mentioned accuracy and one should use the RECPs with at least
21 electrons (e.g., 21e-GRECP for Tl of our group [6]). The 5s and 5p pseudospinors can be
treated as frozen, providing, nevertheless, the above-declared accuracy. The 5p orbitals have
the orbital energies about four times higher and their average radii are 1.4 times shorter than
those for the 5d orbitals. Moreover, their angular correlations are suppressed as compared
with those for the 5d shell because the most “proﬁtable” polarization states (5d in this
case) are completely occupied in the lowest-lying states. Therefore, the 5s, 5p states are
substantially less active in chemical processes.

One can apply the energy level-shift technique in order to “freeze” the 5s and 5p pseu-
dospinors [9,26]. Following Huzinaga et al. [27], one should add the matrix elements of
the SCF ﬁeld operators (the Coulomb and spin-dependent exchange terms) with these OC
pseudospinors to the one-electron part of the Hamiltonian together with the level-shift terms

Xncf ,l,j

Bncf lj Xm g|ncf lcf jmi ghncf lcf jm|,

(10)

where Bncf lj is at least of order |2εncf lj| of magnitude and εncf lj are the orbital energies of

the OC pseudospinors eφncf lj(r) which are frozen. These nonlocal terms are needed in order

to exclude a collapse of the molecular orbitals to the “frozen” states (the 5s1/2, 5p1/2,3/2
pseudospinors for Tl).

All terms with the frozen core pseudospinors described here (the Coulomb and exchange
interactions, the level-shift operator) can easily be presented in the spin-orbit form with
the help of Eq. (9), as was said above with respect to the GRECP operator (the spin-
orbit form of the GRECP operator can be found, e.g., in [9]). More importantly, these OC

8

pseudospinors can be frozen (as spinors) in calculations with the spin-orbit basis sets and
they can be frozen at the stage of calculation of the one-electron matrix elements of the
Hamiltonian (as is implemented in the MOLGEP code [28]). Thus, any integrals with the
indices of the frozen spinors are completely excluded already after the integral calculation
step.

A. Calculation of TlH

The Multi-Reference single- and Double-excitation Conﬁguration Interaction (MRD-CI)
method [29] with the Spin-Orbit (SO) conﬁguration selection scheme [26] was applied in
the ﬁrst precise GRECP calculation of molecules.
In the GRECP/MRD-CI calculations
of spectroscopic properties for the 0+ ground state of TlH [26] (see Table III here), the
21e/8fs-GRECP for Tl was used (i.e., the 21 electron GRECP [6] with 8 electrons occupying
the frozen OC pseudospinors 5s1/2 and 5p1/2,3/2). The contracted [4,4,4,3,2] basis set for
thallium generated in [26] and the [4,3,1] basis for hydrogen (see http://www.qchem.pnpi.-
spb.ru) contracted from the primitive (6,3,1) gaussian basis set of Dunning [30] were used.
Fourteen electrons are correlated in the calculation of spectroscopic constants in TlH
and, as one can see from Table III, very good agreement is found with the experimental
data contrary to other known calculations. Close results are obtained very recently in the
GRECP/RCC calculations of TlH in our joint calculations with group of Prof. Kaldor (Tel-
Aviv University). The GRECP/RCC and GRECP/MRD-CI calculations of HgH and HgH+
are in progress now.

V. CORRELATIONS WITH INNER CORE ELECTRONS AND BREIT EFFECTS

On example of the mercury atom [20,25] the importance of correlation of the inner core
electrons (removed from RECP calculations) was investigated with the help of the combined
MBPT2/CI method [24] and with the RCC method [19].
It is obtained that at least 34
external electrons (occupying the IC 4f shell, outer core 5s, 5p and 5d shells, valence 6s, 6p
etc. shells) of Hg should be correlated and the one-electron basis set should contain up to h
angular momentum functions in order to attain a reliable agreement with the experimental
data for the low excitation energies within 100–200 cm−1, whereas the errors of the gaussian
approximation of the GRECP components and the eﬀects of diﬀerent nuclear models are
negligible for this accuracy. Otherwise, e.g., for the 20 electron RECPs for Hg known from
the literature, energies of excitations from the ground state can not be calculated with the
accuracy better than 200–500 cm−1.

However, our test calculations show that the main contribution from the correlations
with the 4f shell is due to the one-electron correction from the self-energy diagrams [24]
and, therefore, this contribution can be taken into account for the 20 electron GRECP at
the generation stage, i.e. the correlations with the IC 4f shell can be described by the
GRECP. The technique of generating the “correlated” GRECP is discussed by the authors
in [9]. When using such GRECPs in calculations, both required basis sets for the correspond-
ing atoms and computational eﬀorts can be seriously reduced when performing correlation
structure calculations.

9

Turning back to the TlH calculation, further improvement of the accuracy can be at-
tained when correlations with the outer core 4f, 5p and 5s shells of Tl and Breit eﬀects are
taken into account. We expect that this can be eﬃciently done in the framework of the
“correlated” 21e/8fs-GRECP version in which 13 electrons are treated explicitly as in the
above considered GRECP/MRD-CI calculation of TlH.

The ﬁrst correlated GRECP we have generated for the Hg atom in the framework of
the MBPT2 method. Despite the considerable improvement in accuracy with this GRECP
version when calculating excitation energies in Hg, the reliability of the applied generation
scheme was found to be not very high. A new scheme of generation of correlated GRECPs
in the framework of the RCC method is in progress now.

Breit and other QED eﬀects are relatively large for lanthanides and actinides. The
incorporation of these corrections to calculations with RECPs is discussed in our theoretical
paper on the GRECP method [9]. Some recent test calculations have shown that the Breit
and other QED corrections for outer core and valence electrons can be eﬃciently represented
by a one-electron spin-dependent radially local operator and, thus, can be easily incorporated
into GRECPs.

VI. RECPS FOR TRANSITION METALS, LANTHANIDES, AND ACTINIDES

The disadvantage of the commonly used RECP versions for the transition, rare-earth,
etc., elements is that they still require the explicit treatment of essentially larger number of
electrons as compared with other (“normal”) elements in order to attain the same compu-
tational accuracy.

In paper [7], we added “self-consistent” (SfC) terms to the RECP operator which take
account of the circumstance that the RECPs generated for the diﬀerent occupation numbers
of the outermost d or f shells of these elements are somewhat distinguished. Below we
will refer to these shells as OuterMost Core (OMC) shells following the partitioning made
in subsection II D. The signiﬁcant improvement was attained in reproducing the atomic
excitation energies in comparison with the conventional RECP calculations.

Whereas the form of the standard radially local RECP operator accounts for the property
that the dependence of the corresponding potentials Unvlj(r) on the relaxation of the V
spinors (ϕnvlj) is weak in the bond making, the SfC correction to this operator takes into
account the fact of a relatively small relaxation of the OC spinors ϕnclj caused by the change
of the OMC shell occupation number in a majority of cases.

The main features of the SfC RECP constructing for the case of the radially local RECP

are:

1. The all-electron DF calculations of two generator states with diﬀerent occupation
numbers of the OMC d (f ) shell are carried out for an atom under consideration.
These occupation numbers are designated N1 and N2.

2. The “generating” RECPs UN1 and UN2 are constructed for these generator states
employing the standard scheme. The operator for a radially local RECP (incorporating
the SfC corrections into the GRECP is made similarly) has the form

10

UN = EN

core is the core energy and U N

where EN
lj (r) are the radial components of the RECP for
each pair of quantum numbers l and j. They are derived for the OMC d (f ) shell
occupation number N.
This operator diﬀers from the standard (“nodeless”) RECP operator by the EN
core
constant. This value corresponds to the contribution of the core electrons (excluded
from calculations with the conventional RECP) to the total atomic energy and it is
usually excluded from the RECP calculations because the EN
core only shifts all the
energy levels by a constant and does not inﬂuence on the chemical properties. In the
case of the SfC RECP, inequality EN1
core should be taken into account when
transitions with the change of the occupation number N are under consideration.

(13)

where nomc and lomc are the principal and orbital quantum numbers of the OMC shell.

At every iteration of the MC SCF, etc., procedures, the N value can be determined for

the wave function Ψ without a serious complication of the calculation.

We should add here that in a high-precision electronic structure calculation of a heavy-
atom molecule, correlation with the electrons occupying the IC or/and frozen OC states (see
section IV) can be substantial for calculated properties and dependent from the occupation
numbers of states of V and other OC electrons as was demonstrated in [20] for the OC-OC
correlation of 5s and 5d electrons in Hg. Therefore, in principle, the SfC terms dependent
on the occupation numbers of the V states can appear in the expression for the SfC RECP
operator (12). In this case, the use of the “correlated” RECPs UN1 and UN2 also can be
required in (12).

A. SfC GRECP calculations of uranium

In Table IV (compiled from [9]), one-conﬁguration numerical calculations of transition
and ionization energies in uranium are presented for our GRECP versions, for the RECP

11

of Ermler et al. [31] and for the energy-adjusted pseudopotential of K¨uchle et al. [32] as
compared with the DF energies.

The GRECP correcting terms described in Section III allows one to describe accurately
the V region of uranium when the 5f shell occupation number close to that for the generator
state. The addition of the SfC correction increases the accuracy of reproducing the energies
of transitions without changing the 5f shell occupation number in two to eight times and in
those with changing these occupation numbers in 1.5–3 times. One can see from Table IV
that the addition of the quadratic SfC (QSfC) correction (the last term in (12)) leads to a
signiﬁcant increasing (up to 20 times) of the SfC GRECP accuracy for the transitions with
the change of the OMC shell occupation number.

VII. TERM-SPLITTING CORRECTION

As one can see from Table V, the above-discussed SfC corrections give no improvement
in the term splitting of the 5f 3
1/2 conﬁguration of uranium as compared with the
generating GRECPs. Analysis of these errors shows that the main contribution (about 90
%) is due to reproducing the OMC spinors with the help of the nodeless pseudospinors.

5/26d1

3/27s2

Consider the GRECPs with 24 and 32 explicitly treated electrons for which the OMC
5f pseudospinors are nodeless and the 6d ones have radial nodes (for the RECPs with the
14-electron pseudovalence space, for which these OMC shells are described by the nodeless
pseudospinors, the errors are greater in general and the analysis is more complicated).

The simplest way to reduce drastically these errors is to generate and use such GRECP
versions for which the 5f shell is characterized by nodal pseudospinors, whereas the 4f
pseudospinors are nodeless. To reduce computational eﬀorts, the 4f shell can be treated
as frozen in the way described in section IV. However, when approximating the nodal 5f
pseudospinors, some additional basis functions and computational eﬀorts will be required.
If the small magnitude of the OMC shell (5f here) relaxation is taken into account, there
is another way out which can be applied for the cases of low-lying states. We suggest to add
the terms

UT Sc = Xx1,x2,x3,x4
− 2Xw Xx1,x2,x3

λx1x2,x3x4g|x1ighx2| · g|x3ighx4|
(λx1x2,x3x3 − λx1x3,x3x2)δwx3g|x1ighx2|,

(14)

where xi = (nomc, lomc, ji, mi) 1, to the GRECP operator. These terms are correcting the
one- and two-electron integrals with the 5f pseudospinors (and only these integrals).

The results of our calculations (Table V) show that the addition of the Term-Splitting
(TS) correction (called in [9] by the SO correction) allows one to reduce the most serious

1 The ji and mi indices run over all the possible values for a given (nomc, lomc). In the case of the
partially occupied OMC 5f shell, the xi indices correspond to both OC and virtual pseudospinors
(i.e., occupied and unoccupied one-electron states in the generator state).

12

errors about 10 times for the term splittings, thus reducing the errors for the transition
energies between terms to the same order of magnitude as are the errors for transitions
between the states averaged over the diﬀerent conﬁgurations (Table IV).

VIII. ELECTRONIC DENSITIES AND SINGULAR OPERATORS IN ATOMIC

CORES

To evaluate the matrix elements of the operators being singular in the core regions of
heavy atoms in a molecule after the RECP calculation of this molecule at the ﬁrst step,
the proper shapes of the valence four-component molecular spinors must be restored in the
atomic core regions at the second step.

The applicability of the two-step algorithms to the electronic structure calculation of
heavy-atom molecules is a consequence of the fact that the valence and core electron sub-
spaces may be represented as the subsystems, interaction between which is described mainly
by some integrated and not by detailed properties of these subsystems. As a result, the use
of the GRECP allows one to reproduce accurately the original electronic densities in the
valence region for excited states as it is demonstrated on U in [9] and on Hg, Tl, Pb, and
Bi in [6]. Another result is that the electronic structure can be restored in the core regions
of heavy atoms after the GRECP calculation of a molecule with a good accuracy.

Both the nonvariational procedures (Pacios & Christiansen, 1985; Titov, 1986) [33,34]
and the variational technique (Titov, 1996) [35] for the electronic structure restoration after
the shape-consistent RECP calculation were suggested.

In [34,36–39], the nonvariational restoration technique was applied to evaluation of the
hyperﬁne constants and the parity non-conservation eﬀects in the PbF, HgF, BaF, and YbF
molecules. The molecular pseudoorbitals in the form of linear combinations of atomic pseu-
doorbitals were evaluated at the RECP calculation stage. Then, the atomic pseudoorbitals
were replaced by the unsmoothed four-component DF spinors derived for the same atomic
conﬁgurations as the basis pseudoorbitals. The MO LCAO coeﬃcients were preserved af-
ter the RECP calculation. Such constructed molecular relativistic spinors were used for
calculation of the P,T-odd spin-rotational Hamiltonian parameters.

In a general case, the ﬁrst-order reduced density matrix, {gDpq}, should be evaluated

after the molecular RECP calculation on the basis set of atomic pseudospinors whereas the
matrix elements {AK
pq} of the one-electron operators of hyperﬁne interaction etc., {AK},
should be evaluated in the equivalent basis set of atomic four-component spinors. Then the
physical values are calculated as

(15)

hAKi = Xpq gDpqAK

pq .

The latest ab initio calculations of the hyperﬁne, P -odd, and P, T -odd constants
for the BaF and YbF molecules are performed by our group with the help of the
GRECP/RASSCF/EO scheme [38,39] (RASSCF is the Restricted Active Space SCF
method [40] and EO is Eﬀective Operator technique based on MBPT2 [24,38]). This tech-
nique allows one to take into account polarization and correlation in the valence and core
regions. The electronic wave function of BaF and YbF for the ground (2Σ1/2) states is cal-
culated in the GRECP approximation. The molecular four-component spinors in the core

13

region of heavy atoms are restored in the framework of the non-variational procedure. Core
polarization/correlation eﬀects are taken into account with the help of the atomic MBPT2
when constructing the eﬀective valence Hamiltonians for the Ba and Yb atoms.

A. Calculations of YbF

The results for the YbF molecule by Mosyagin et al. (1998) [39] are presented in Table VI
compared with other results. For the isotropic hyperﬁne constant A = (Ak + 2A⊥)/3, the
accuracy of our calculation is about 3% as compared to the experimental datum. The dipole
constant Ad = (Ak − A⊥)/3 (which is much smaller in magnitude), though better than in
all previous calculations known from the literature, is still underestimated by almost 23%.
Being corrected within a semiempirical approach for a perturbation of 4f -shell in the core of
Yb due to the bond making, this error is reduced to 8%. Our value for the eﬀective electric
ﬁeld on the unpaired electron is 4.9 a.u.=2.5 × 1010 V cm−1.

One can see from Table VI that the values of the Wd constant

Wdde = 2h2Σ1/2|Hd|2Σ1/2i,

where Hd describes interaction of the electron EDM (i.e. Electric Dipole Moment) de with
the internal molecular ﬁeld Emol:

Hd = 2de  0 0

0 σ! · Emol,

(16)

from the unrestricted DF calculation of Parpia (1998) [41], the most recent semiempirical
calculation of Kozlov (1997) [42] and our latest GRECP/RASSCF/EO calculation are in a
very close agreement now. It should be noted that the valence electron contribution to the
Wd in [41] is in 7.4% agreement with the corresponding RECP-based calculation of Titov et
al. (1996) [37]. Another recent DF calculation of Quiney et al. (1998) [43] gives the value,
which is two times smaller.

It is clear from the calculation that the 4f electrons in the core of ytterbium should
be explicitly treated in the planned GRECP calculation of YbF by the relativistic coupled
cluster method in order to obtain the parameters of P, T -odd spin-rotational Hamiltonian
with better accuracy.

B. Variational restoration

In the variational technique of the restoration [35], the proper behavior of the four-
component molecular spinors in the core regions of heavy atoms may be restored as an
expansion on the spherical harmonics inside the sphere with an atomic core radius Rrest. The
outer parts of spinors are frozen after the RECP calculation of the molecule considered. This
method enables one to combine the advantages of two well-developed approaches: molecular
RECP calculations (with gaussian basis sets) and one-center calculations (of atomic type
with, e.g., numerical functions) in the most optimal way.

14

The most promising application of the two-step method is in a possibility to “split” the
correlation structure calculation of a molecule on two consequent calculations in the valence
and core regions when the OC and V electrons are explicitly involved into the GRECP
calculation and the OC and IC space regions are treated at the one-center restoration stage.
Roughly speaking, the computational eﬀorts for the correlation structure calculations
in the core and valence regions are added within the two-step technique, whereas in the
ordinary one-step scheme, they are multiplied by each other.

The eﬃciency of the two-step technique was conﬁrmed in the BaF and YbF calculations
[38,39]. Even these not yet perfect calculations have provided a high accuracy (5–10 %) for
the P,T-odd spin-rotational Hamiltonian parameters (which can be compared with the 50
% error for the hyperﬁne constants in YbF with the correlations in the V region taken into
account within RASSCF), thus conﬁrming a considerable promise of the two-step scheme
for the correlation structure calculations.

Abstract

Model macroion solutions next to a charged wall show interface true over-

charging, charge reversal and inversion, and layering. Macroion layering is

present, even if the wall or the macroparticle are uncharged or if the wall and

macroions are like-charged. An eﬀective long-range attractive force between

the adsorbed macroions is implied. The results are obtained through an inte-

gral equation theory and a new extended Poisson-Boltzmann theory, and are

in accordance with experiments on conﬁned macroions and polymer layering.

The restricted primitive model (RPM) for an electrolyte solution includes the two main

forces in this system: the long range Coulombic and the short-range repulsive forces. In

RPM the ions are taken to be hard spheres of diameter a and charge ezi (e is the protonic

charge and zi is the ionic valence), embedded in a dielectric medium of dielectric constant

ε. This model has been shown to be in agreement with Monte Carlo (MC) simulations and

experimental results of bulk and conﬁned electrolyte systems [1].

When a divalent electrolyte, at high concentration, is next to a charged wall, the charge

of the adsorbed counterions to the wall overcome that on the wall. This eﬀect produces a

second layer of ions, where the coions outnumber the counterions. These eﬀects are known

as charge reversal (CR), some times (perhaps improperly) referred to as overcharging, and

charge inversion (CI), respectively. Although these phenomena have been reported, both

theoretically [2] and by computer simulations [3], since 1980, important implications to

protein electrophoresis [4] and medicine [5] were later recognized. On the other hand, the

long-range attraction between conﬁned like-charged macroparticles [6] and the adsorption

of macroions onto oppositely charged [7] or like-charged [8] surfaces have received much

attention. The understanding of these phenomena have been recognized as relevant for the

colloid science and technology [9], the oil industry, and molecular self-assembly (e.g., DNA

encapsulation) and nano-structured ﬁlms (e.g., polyelectrolyte layering) [5,7,8].

Here, we extend the hypernetted chain/mean spherical approximation (HNC/MSA) in-

tegral equation [10] to be applied to model macroion solutions next to a charged wall.

The HNC/MSA has been proved to be in good agreement with Monte Carlo data for

the electrical double layer (EDL) of closely related models [11,12]. Because of the larger

macroion’s size, this theory is expected to be even more reliable than for the simple elec-

trolyte case [2,12]. The macroparticle is taken as a charged, hard sphere of diameter aM ,

concentration ρM and valence zM , whereas the little ions are modeled by the RPM. The

wall has uniform surface charge density σ0. The wall dielectric constant is chosen to be

equal to that of the solvent, to avoid image potentials. The ionic distribution, as a func-

tion of the distance x from the surface of the wall, gives the structure of the equilibrium

2

EDL, and is expressed in terms of the concentration proﬁles, ρwi(x) = ρigwi(x). ρι is

the bulk concentration, of the ionic species i, and gwi(x) is the species i reduced concen-

tration proﬁle (RCP). The HNC/MSA integral equations for the RCPs are given by [10]

gwi(x) ≡ exp[−βWi(x)] = exp [ −β (eziψ(x) + Ji(x))]. Wi(x) is the potential of mean force,

i.e., the eﬀective total wall-ion interaction potential. Wi(x) has two contributions: the elec-

trostatic potential part, given by the mean electrostatic potential,ψ(x), plus the short range

repulsive potential part, due to the ionic size, given by Ji(x). Both functions are func-

tionals of ρwi(x). β=1/(KBT), where KB is the Boltzmann constant and T is the absolute

temperature. The ion-ion and the macroion-ion direct interaction potentials are given by a

hard-sphere potential plus the Coulombic potential. In the limiting case of a = 0 HNC/MSA

reduces to the integral equation form of a new extended inhomogeneous Poisson-Boltzmann

(PB) theory [1,5,9] for point ions plus macroions, next to a charged wall. Since macroions

are considered at ﬁnite concentration, this approach is an improvement to the classical PB

equation for conﬁned macroions, at inﬁnite dilution [5,9], where only two macroions are

considered:

i.e., in our theory macroion-macroion correlations are included. For a=0 and

ρM =0, we recover the integral equation version of the classical Gouy-Chapman (GC) theory

for point-ions next to a charged wall [9]. A point-ion model (PIM) for an electrolyte solution

is like the RPM, but a=0.

We have solved HNC/MSA for several values of ZM , aM , ρM , σ0 and salt parameters:

z+ : z−, ρι and a. We calculated gwi(x), ψ(x) and the eﬀective charge density, σ(x) =

ρel(y)dy [10,13] . The charge proﬁle in the solution is given by ρel(x) ≡

ezmρmgm(x),

−

∞
R
x

where we have omitted the sub-index w, for notation simplicity. x=a/2 is the distance

of closest approach, to the wall, of the small ions. Hence, σ0 = −

ρel(y)dy, by the

electroneutrality condition, and σ′(x) ≡

ρel(y)dy is the charge induced by the wall, on
the ﬂuid, between the wall and the distance x to the wall. Hence, σ(x) ( ≡ σ′(x) + σ0) is

the eﬀective or net charge (wall plus ﬂuid) at the distance x away from the wall. σ(x)

measures overcharging, CR or CI at the interface. The eﬀective electrostatic force on an ion

is f e

charging but also of the wall-particle eﬀective electrical force. Fi(x) = − ∂Wi(x)

ε σ(x). Therefore, σ(x) is not only a measure of the over (under)-
∂ ln [gi(x)]
∂x

∂x = 1

∂x = 4πezi

β

is the net eﬀective, many-body, force between the wall and an ion of species i. Hence,

Fi(x) = f e

i (x) + f s

i (x), where f s

i (x) ≡ ∂Ji(x)

∂x

contains the non-electrostatic contributions.

The larger the ionic size, the larger the conﬁnement excluded volume (CEV) and the smaller

the accessible volume. In our case, f s

i (x) has the ionic excluded volume contributions. Since

both ψ(x) and Ji(x) are functionals of ρel(y) and are in a non-linear equation, the charge

and size correlations are, in general, not independent [10,13] and, hence, our theory predicts

that overcharging, if present, is related to both the electrical charge and the ionic size. It is

an elementary statistical mechanics result that the smaller the accessible volume the smaller

the entropy of the system. Thus, the larger the ionic size the lower the entropy of the

system. Charge correlations of like-charged ions have the eﬀect of also reducing the system’s

accessible volume and, thus, of reducing its entropy.

In all our calculations T=298 K, ε=78.5 and ρM =0.01 M.

In the RPM calculations

a=4.25 ˚A. The 4.25 ˚A ionic size approximately corresponds to that of a hydrated ion.

In Fig. 1, the macroion has negative charge, which is opposite to that of the wall and

the divalent salt ion. The macroion RCP shows a very strong adsorption to the wall. A

second layer of macroions is adsorbed, with an intermediate layer of divalent positive ions,

followed by monovalent negative little ions. A layer of positive divalent ions, followed by a

monovalent negative ions layer, also mediates a third layer of adsorbed negative macroions.

The macroions of the ﬁrst layer are surrounded by counterions. Subsequent layers of, less

concentrated, macroions are observed, also mediated by layers of positive and negative

little ions. Considering that the bulk macroion concentration is 0.01M, the local macroion

concentration at the second peak, ≈0.035M, is not negligible. The ﬁrst peak is ≈20M.

Hence, large macroions, next to a highly charged wall, assemble next to the wall. In the

inset, at a distance of one macroion radius, a deep minimum is observed, corresponding to

a very strong CR. The maximum located around 15a/2 show a CI. For x lower than one

4

macroion radius, true overcharging of the wall is present: That is, wall’s divalent coions, are

adsorbed to the wall and their charge exceeds that of the wall plus the adsorbed negative

little ions. This eﬀect has not been reported before and is probably present only in macroions

solutions. The eﬀective wall electrical ﬁeld, which is proportional to σ(x), is positive before

the ﬁrst layer of macroions and then negative, before the second layer. Hence, the electrical

force is ﬁrst attractive and then repulsive to negative ions. The behavior of the total force

on an ion of species i, however, is implicit in the RCP, i.e., a gi(x) above (below) 1 implies

that Fi(x) is attractive (repulsive). At x = a/2, σ(x) is equal to the wall’s charge, whereas

for x → ∞, σ(x) → 0, as it should be if electroneutrality is satisﬁed. Lower wall charge

density or lower macroion’s charge, size or concentration produce lower adsorption. The 2:1

electrolyte solution does not show CR.

In Fig. 2, the wall and macroion have negative charge. Here, the positive divalent little

ions are counterions of the wall and macroion. A layer of positive ions, followed by negative

ions is adsorbed to the wall. Then, a strong adsorption of macroions is observed. In the inset,

a CR is followed by a CI. In Fig. 1, the macroions are responsible for the ﬁrst CR, whereas,

in Fig. 2, they are responsible for the ﬁrst CI. The 2:1 electrolyte does show CR. Thus,

if no macroions are present, monovalent counterions do not produce CR, whereas divalent

counterions do. The ﬁrst peak corresponds to a 0.2 M macroion concentration. This implies

a long-range eﬀective attraction, between the adsorbed macroions. This attraction is lower,

as the macroions-wall distance increases or for smaller macroions. Our results show that

the macroion adsorption depends on ρ∗
T

≡ ρ+a3

+ + ρ−a3

− + ρM a3

M , i.e., it depends on the

CEV. Hence, adsorption of larger macroions implies longer range and more strong eﬀective

macroion-macroion attraction. These ﬁndings are suggestive, in relation to experimentally

reported attraction between like-charged macroions, next to a like-charged wall, where µm

size conﬁned macroions show the same behavior [6].

In Fig. 3, uncharged, large particles, immersed into a 1:1 RPM electrolyte are next

to a negatively charged wall. A slight CR is observed in the inset, even though that the

counterions are monovalent. EDL studies for 1:1 electrolytes show that there is no charge

5

or RCP oscillations around 1 [2]. Hence, in Fig. 3, the oscillations in the little ions RCP are

due to size correlations related to the macroparticle adsorption to the wall. Thus, macroion

charge is not necessary to have macroparticle adsorption and their presence induce ionic

oscillations for 1:1 electrolytes.

In Fig. 4 the wall is uncharged. Since the macroion has a larger size, aM =6.5a, we have

increased the macroion’s charge to have the same macroion’s surface charge density. The

result is a strong adsorption of macroions to the wall. The local macroion concentration, at

contact with the wall is ≈6.63M. In the inset, strong positive and negative true overcharging

of the wall is seen. If aM =4.5a or ZM =-40 (not shown) the maximum of the second layer

of macroions decreases from 1.7, in Fig. 4, to 1.2, but the RCP’s and σ(x) curves are

qualitatively equal.

If no macroions are present, σ(x) = 0, ∀x > 0. Since the wall is

uncharged, the strong macroion adsorption and wall overcharging is due to the large CEV,

imposed by the macroions size. Thus less accessible volume, which implies less entropy,

impose more order at the interface, i.e., more adsorption to the wall.

In Fig. 5, we repeat the calculation of Fig. 4 but, now, the electrolyte species have zero

diameter (PIM) and the macroion has a smaller diameter, aM =4.5a. This case corresponds

to an extension of the PB theory, where only two macroions are considered [6].

In the

inset, before one macroion radius, positive overcharging is present. The maximum is at

x = aM /2. The maximum of negative overcharging is at x ≈9.6a/2. If no macroions are

present, σ(x) = 0, ∀x > 0. Notice the oscillations in the point-ion RCP. This oscillatory

behavior is in accordance with the exact second moment condition (SMC) of Stillinger and

Lovett [14]. However, it is well known that the RCPs obtained from the PB equation for PIM

electrolytes in bulk, next to a charged wall or around two macroions (DLVO theory [5,9]),

do not show oscillations and the macroion-macroion interaction is purely repulsive [1,9]. In

fact, it is a mathematical theorem that the PB equation can not predict and attractive

force for two like-charged macroions, between them or with the wall, at inﬁnite dilution [15].

The adsorption of macroions to the wall implies an eﬀective attraction between them and

with the wall. The diﬀerence of our Fig. 5 result with the classical PB result is the ﬁnite

6

concentration of macroions, which implies a proper consideration of entropy.

In summary, CR, CI and true overcharging of a wall depend on electrostatic interactions

and on the CEV, which depends on ρ∗
T

≡ ρ+a3

+ + ρ−a3

− + ρM a3

M (larger ρ∗

T implies more

adsorption). On one hand: a) Higher wall or macroion charge, enhance adsorption; b)

Typical hydrated monovalent counterions (e.g., Na+, a ≈4.25 ˚A) do not show CR (Fig.

1), whereas typical divalent counterions do (Fig. 2). This is due to a greater eﬃciency

of divalent counterions to store charge [16]. On the other hand: 1) Overcharging can be

present for uncharged walls or macroions, or for like charged wall and macroions, provided

ρ∗
T is suﬃciently large; 2) Point ions can never overcharge a surface [1,4,9,13]; 3) In a pure
electrolyte solution, larger monovalent counterions, such as hydrated Li+ (a ≈7 ˚A), show

CR [17]. Therefore, while that CR, CI and true overcharging result from the competition

between energy vs. entropy, our results show that entropy has a much more important role

than has been recognized in the past, and give some insight on the experimentally found

long range eﬀective attraction of like-charged macroions next to a wall [6], polymer layering

[7]decher97, and self-assembled complexes [5].

We present a systematic Density Functional Theory (DFT) study of geometries and energies of the
nucleic acid DNA bases (guanine, adenine, cytosine and thymine) and 30 diﬀerent DNA base-pairs.
We use a recently developed linear-scaling DFT scheme, which is specially suited for systems with
large numbers of atoms. As a ﬁrst step towards the study of large DNA systems, in this work: (i)
We establish the reliability of the approximations of our method (including pseudopotentials and
basis sets) for the description of the hydrogen-bonded base pairs, by comparing our results with
those of former calculations. We show that the interaction energies at Hartree-Fock geometries are
in very good agreement with those of second order Møller-Plesset (MP2) perturbation theory (the
most accurate technique that can be applied at present for system of the sizes of the base-pairs). (ii)
We perform DFT structural optimizations for the 30 diﬀerent DNA base-pairs, only three of which
had been previously studied with DFT. Our results provide information on the eﬀect of correlation
on the structure of the other 27 base pairs, for which only Hartree-Fock geometries were formerly
available.

I. INTRODUCTION

Hydrogen bonds between complementary purine-
pyrimidine bases play a signiﬁcant role in the bonding
between the two strands of the double helix structures of
DNA1. Nevertheless, other factors are also of paramount
importance in determining the structure of the helix. For
instance, base-stacking2–4 plays a crucial role in preserv-
ing the hydrophobe aromatic rings from interacting with
water molecules, besides contributing to increase the Van
der Waals interactions. Also, both counterions5,6 and
water molecules are important in screening the electro-
static repulsion between the negatively charged phos-
phate groups. The theoretical study of these systems and
the eﬀects of each type of interaction have been hindered
by the great complexity of the calculations, both due to
the diﬃculty in treating such diﬀerent interactions, and
to the large number of atoms involved.

Although some progress has been done recently,7 semi-
empirical quantum chemistry (QC) methods and empir-
ical force ﬁelds8,9 are generally not accurate enough to
describe these systems. The most reliable procedure is
undoubtedly the ab-initio QC approach, in which the ac-
curacy of the calculation can be systematically improved
by increasing the size and quality of the basis set and
the level of correlation included10. This can be a power-
ful method to study DNA and other biological systems,
and a unique tool to address some of their properties.
However, the intensive numerical eﬀort required by these
methods poses a serious limitation to the system sizes

that can be handled at a satisfactory level of the the-
ory10, a fact which has precluded their use in realistic
biological systems.

An alternative, which allows calculations for system
sizes well beyond the limits of the traditional ab-initio QC
methods, is the Density Functional Theory11,12 (DFT).
At present, it appears that DFT is the only ﬁrst prin-
ciples method potentially capable of handling the large
sizes involved, although the standard DFT techniques
are still too expensive to solve systems with more than a
very few hundreds of atoms, like those in DNA molecules.
If the DFT methods are to make an impact in biologi-
cal systems, it is neccesary to be able to go beyond the
current size limits, but maintaining the current accu-
racy. In this context, an extremely promising develop-
ment has been the recent search for computational tech-
niques in which the numerical eﬀort scales only linearly
with system size: the so called ’order-N’ methods (see
Ref. 13 for a review). They open, for the ﬁrst time,
the possibility of performing calculations in very large
molecules, and have already been applied to the study
of DNA chains with many hundreds of atoms by means
of semi-empirical Hamiltonians14 and approximate, non-
selfconsistent DFT15.

The application of order-N techniques in the context
of fully ﬁrst-principles, selfconsistent DFT calculations is,
in general, in a less advanced development state. Nev-
ertheless, we have recently proposed a DFT method and
the corresponding computer code SIESTA, with order-N
scaling, which is able to do such calculations in systems

1

with thousands of atoms, in single-processor worksta-
tions16–19. Our preliminary tests17,18 have demonstrated
that the method is able to treat systems as large as a
whole turn of a DNA chain with more than 650 atoms,
therefore opening the possibility of studying large biolog-
ical molecules from ﬁrst principles. Work in this direction
is underway, and will be published elsewhere.20

The purpose of this paper, as a ﬁrst step in the ap-
plication of the method to complex biological systems,
and in particular to DNA molecules, is to make a thor-
ough study of isolated nitrogenated bases and hydrogen-
bonded base-pairs. This study serves to validate the
present method (basis orbitals, approximations and nu-
merical techniques) for the study of these base-pairs, by
comparing the energies and geometries with those of pre-
vious calculations, where available. The results presented
here show that our method provides a very accurate de-
scription of these systems, with the advantage of being
considerably fast and, as mentioned, capable of reaching
very large system sizes. Besides, we provide a systematic
DFT study of the structures of the diﬀerent base-pairs,
and the eﬀect of the relaxations on the interaction ener-
gies. The use of our DFT scheme to obtain equilibrium
geometries has the advantage that it includes correlation
eﬀects, which are absent in the available Hartree-Fock
(HF) geometries.21 At the same time, it is computation-
ally feasible, unlike the Møller-Plesset second order per-
turbation theory22 (MP2) method.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Sec-
tion II we discuss the details of our DFT method and
of the calculations performed. Section III describes the
energetics of the base-pairs at the available HF geome-
tries, comparing our results with those of MP2 calcula-
tions in the literature. Section IV presents our results for
the DFT structural relaxations. Finally, in Section V we
present the conclusions of this work.

II. METHOD AND CALCULATIONS DETAILS

A. The SIESTA method

All our calculations have been done with SIESTA18, a
code for DFT calculations in systems with a large number
of atoms, in which the cost of the calculation (both in
memory and CPU time) scales linearly with the size of
the system. Here we give only a brief description of the
basic approximations involved in the calculation, whereas
a detailed description can be found in Refs. 18,19.

We treat exchange-correlation (XC) within the frame-
work of the Kohn-Sham formulation12 of DFT11.
It is
rather well known from many calculations in a variety
of systems23–27 that a correct description of hydrogen-
bonds requires the use of non-local XC functionals. The
Local Density Approximation (LDA) yields bond dis-
tances in the hydrogen bonds which are about 10−15%
shorter and binding energies about 50−70% larger than

the experimental values.
Inclusion of gradient correc-
tions in several Generalized Gradient Approximations
(GGA) functionals improves the description dramati-
cally, achieving levels of accuracy an order of magnitude
better than LDA. In this work we have used the ﬁrst
principles GGA functional proposed recently by Perdew,
Burke and Ernzerhof28 (PBE).

SIESTA uses non-local, norm-conserving pseudopoten-
tials to eliminate the core electrons from the calculation,
and to produce a smoother valence charge density. In this
work, the pseudopotentials are obtained from ﬁrst prin-
ciples, following the scheme of Troullier and Martins29.
The valence electrons are described using the linear com-
bination of atomic orbitals (LCAO) approximation.

An essential ingredient for the linear scaling within this
approach is the ﬁnite range of the matrix elements be-
tween atomic orbitals. To achieve it, we use basis orbitals
which strictly vanish beyond a cutoﬀ radius30 (instead of
the usual approach of using decaying orbitals and neglect-
ing matrix elements by whatever criterion). The main
advantage is consistency: given a basis, the eigenvalue
problem is solved for the full Hamiltonian. Thus, the pro-
cedure is numerically very stable even for short ranges,
in contrast with the usual approach. Since the computa-
tional load grows substantially with the basis range, it is
important to work with basis functions that display fast
convergence for short orbital ranges. We have developed
a scheme for ﬁnite range basis set generation which we
will now outline.19

In this and previous works, the radial parts of the
ﬁnite-range orbitals were determined in the spirit of
the method of Sankey and Niklewski,31 who proposed
a scheme for minimal (single-ζ) bases that we have gen-
eralized to arbitrarily complete sets. The single-ζ or-
bitals are obtained by solving the DFT atomic problem
(including the pseudopotential) with the boundary con-
dition for the orbitals of being zero beyond the cutoﬀ
radius, while remaining continuous. For the eﬃcient gen-
eration of larger, more complete basis sets we have used
the ideas developed within the QC community over the
years, incorporating them into new schemes adapted to
numerical, ﬁnite-range bases for linear scaling. Numeri-
cal multiple-ζ bases are constructed in the split-valence
philosophy18,19. Given an atomic orbital, it is split into
two or more functions. The ﬁrst splitting is made by in-
troducing a smooth function that reproduces exactly the
tail of the original orbital beyond a speciﬁed radius. The
diﬀerence between the original orbital and this smooth
function is an orbital with an even shorter range. Multi-
ple splits are obtained by repeating the procedure. Our
approach also allows polarization orbitals19. These are
obtained by numerically solving the problem of the iso-
lated atom in the presence of a polarizing electric ﬁeld.
Comparing the solution with a perturbative expansion
(Sternheimer equations32) gives the shape of the wanted
polarization orbitals. The cutoﬀ radius of the polariza-
tion orbitals is therefore the same as the one of the shell
being polarized.

2

In all the calculations presented in this work we have
used a double-ζ (split valence) basis with polarization
functions in all the atoms (including hydrogen). The
cutoﬀ radii for the atomic orbitals of each element can be
seen in Table I, as were obtained by ﬁxing a conﬁnement
energy30 of 50 meV.

The matrix elements of the diﬀerent terms of the Kohn-
Sham Hamiltonian are calculated in one of two diﬀer-
ent ways18. The terms that involve integrals over two
atoms only (kinetic energy, overlap, and other terms re-
lated with the pseudopotential, see below) are computed
a priori as a function of the distance between the cen-
ters, and stored in tables to be interpolated later with
very little use of time and memory. The other terms
are calculated with the help of a uniform grid of points
in real space. The smoothness of the integrands deter-
mines how ﬁne a grid is needed, and, of course, the ﬁner
the grid, the more expensive the calculation. We remark
that the use of pseudopotentials, which eliminates the
rapidly varying core charge, is essential to provide func-
tions smooth enough to make the grid integration fea-
sible. This ﬁneness is measured by the energy of the
shortest wave-length plane-wave that can be described
with the grid, in analogy with plane-wave calculations.
In all the calculations presented here, we have used a
cutoﬀ of 125 Ry.

The calculation of the pseudopotential matrix elements
is done very eﬃciently using the Kleinman-Bylander33
factorized form. It allows the three-center integrals of the
pseudopotential between atomic orbitals to be treated as
products of two-center integrals, which are tabulated as
described above.

With the bases, approximations and techniques de-
scribed so far, the Kohn-Sham hamiltonian is built up
with order-N operations. The solution to the eigenvalue
problem can also be obtained with a linear scaling ef-
fort using techniques recently developed, and available
in SIESTA13,34. For the small systems considered here,
however, the straight diagonalization (which scales as the
cube of the number of orbitals) requires very little eﬀort,
and therefore has been used in this work to solve the
Kohn-Sham eigenvalue equations.

B. Details of the calculations

In order to reach reliable conclusions about the accu-
racy of our method, we have used in this study a large
set of 30 base-pairs. Besides the common Watson-Crick
guanine-cytosine and thymine-adenine pairs, we also con-
sider a signiﬁcant range of other conﬁgurations of the four
bases guanine, cytosine, adenine and thymine (G, C, A,
T). These are the same as those studied by ˇSponer et al.21
in their MP2 study. The Watson-Crick conﬁgurations are
designated WC, and the Hoogsteen, reversed Hoogsteen
and reversed Watson-Crick appear as H, RH, RWC re-
spectively. Other conﬁgurations are distinguished simply

with numbers, eg. AA1, AA2, etc. In assigning the num-
bers to the pairs we have followed the nomenclature of
Hobza and Sandorfy35, who classiﬁed the pairs in order of
decreasing stability. Their ordering was not conﬁrmed by
later results (including ours), but the convention is nev-
ertheless maintained to simplify comparisons and avoid
confusion. The structures of the bases and base-pairs
studied in this work can be found in Figures 1 and 2 of
Ref. 21. For the numbering of the atoms we followed
Ref. 36.

In the calculation of the energetics of the base-pairs, we
have analyzed two diﬀerent quantities. First, the inter-
action energy Eint, deﬁned as the energy of the base-pair
minus the energy of each base with the same geometry
it has in the pair. Second, the total stabilization energy,
Et, deﬁned as the diﬀerence between the energy of the
pair and that of each base in its isolated optimal geome-
try. Therefore, the diﬀerence between Et and Eint is the
deformation energy, i.e., the increase in intramolecular
energy due to the geometry change when the base-pair is
formed.

Due to the ﬁnite size of the bases used, both Eint
and Et have to be corrected for the basis set super-
position error37 (BSSE). In this work, all the energies
have been corrected for BSSE, as described in the follow-
ing. For the interaction energy, we have used the stan-
dard Boys-Bernardi counterpoise correction37: the BSSE
is calculated as the diﬀerence between the energies of
the isolated bases obtained with the orbitals of the base
alone, and with the “ghost” orbitals of the other base:
BSSE = E(A) + E(B) − E(A∗) − E(B∗) (where the as-
terisks indicate the inclusion of the orbitals of the other
base in the calculation). The same correction is used for
the stabilization energy Et. Since Et contains the defor-
mation energy Edef , this approach is valid only if Edef is
not much aﬀected by the BSSE (i.e., if the change in the
BSSE is not large when calculated with the relaxed iso-
lated bases geometry instead of the coordinates of each
base in the pair)38. We tested this and found that the
variation in BSSE calculated with these two geometries is
only about 10% of the total BSSE value, so we will con-
sider that the BSSE correction deﬁned above is as valid
for Et as for Eint.

The structural relaxations were done by means of a
conjugate gradient minimization of the energy, until the
forces on all atoms were smaller than 0.04 eV/˚A. No con-
straints were imposed in the relaxation, except the pla-
narity of the base-pairs. This constraint was imposed in
order to facilitate comparison with the results of ˇSponer
et al., who also analyze planar bases and base-pairs. In
the relaxations, forces are calculated as analytical deriva-
tives of the total energy18. No BSSE correction was in-
cluded in the forces. This would lead to problems if the
BSSE had an important variation with atomic positions,
since in that case the relaxed geometries obtained with-
out the BSSE correction would not correspond to the
minimum of the total energy including the BSSE correc-
tion. In order to check this, corrected and not corrected

3

interaction energies of the AA1 base-pair were calculated
as a function of the distance, separating the molecules
rigidly in the H bonds direction. As expected, the BSSE
is more important in absolute value as the two bases
are brought closer, and decreases as the bases are sep-
arated. However, the results show that this variation
does not appreciably aﬀect neither the equilibrium dis-
tance (the acceptor-hydrogen distance was 1.95 ˚A for the
uncorrected curve and 1.97 ˚A for the corrected one) nor
the vibrational frequencies.

Finally, it is worth mentioning the computational re-
quirements of the calculations presented here. All the
computations were performed in a PC with a 120 MHz
Pentium processor. For the relaxations of the base-pairs,
the calculations took an average of about 4 hours of CPU
time for each relaxation step. The memory usage was be-
low 100 Mb, and virtually no disk use was neccesary (all
the integrals being stored in memory). This shows the
eﬃciency of the code, and the possibility of studying rel-
atively large systems in very modest platforms.

III. ENERGIES AT HF/6-31G** GEOMETRIES

In order to demonstrate the accuracy and validity
of our method for the description of the energies of
hydrogen-bonded base-pairs, we need a reference with
which to compare our results. Since the experimental in-
formation on energies and structures of isolated bases and
base-pairs is very scarce, we have used the results from
former ab-initio calculations as a benchmark. There is a
large amount of work done in these systems in the con-
text of ab-initio QC methods.10 Probably the most com-
plete and sophisticated calculations are those performed
by ˇSponer and coworkers,21 using the MP2 method. This
usually covers a substantial part of the correlation energy,
and is the most accurate correlation technique that can
be applied at present for systems of the size of a few
tens of atoms, like the base-pairs. However, these cal-
culations are still computationally expensive, and there-
fore they can only be done using medium sized bases
(typically 6-31G**) and ﬁxed geometries obtained with
simpler schemes like HF. Geometry optimizations at the
MP2 level have only been possible for the smallest, high-
est symmetry base-pair (cytosine-cytosine)21.

We will therefore discuss the interaction energies ob-
tained with SIESTA for the base-pairs in the HF/6-
31G** geometries of ˇSponer et al.21, and compare with
the corresponding MP2 results. The data are shown in
Table II. GG2 and GC2 base-pairs are not included in
this table because at this level of relaxations these pairs
are not stable and converge to the conﬁgurations of GG1
and GCNEW, respectively. We compare with the MP2
results21 evaluated on the same geometry. We also show
the percentage deviation between both results. For all
the base-pairs except GG4, the agreement is consider-
ably good, with diﬀerences smaller than 8% and much

less in most cases. GG4 seems to be an exception to the
general trend as its diﬀerence with the MP2 value is 26%.
We tried to see if this was a problem of the basis set and
made calculations with larger cut-oﬀ radii for the atomic
orbitals. For an energy shift of 10 meV the interaction
energy was -8.4 kcal/mol, so the deviation with respect
to the MP2 results is reduced to 16%, but it is still far
larger than for the rest of the base-pairs (for other base-
pairs, the diﬀerence in the interaction energy for the 50
and 10 meV energy shift bases is much smaller than in
the GG4 case).

The standard deviation of our results compared to
the MP2 values is of 0.73 kcal/mol. It is interesting to
compare these results with the DFT values obtained by
ˇSponer et al.21 for the same HF/6-31G** geometries, us-
ing the Becke3LYP functional39. The largest deviation
of their results is of 1.3 kcal/mol (11 % of Eint) for the
TC1 pair, while the standard deviation from the MP2 re-
sults is accidentally the same as ours: 0.73 kcal/mol. We
can therefore conclude that the results obtained for the
energies at ﬁxed geometries using the PBE functional are
of similar degree of accuracy as those obtained by other
authors with other GGA functionals. The standard devi-
ation between our results and the DFT data of ˇSponer et
al. is about 0.85 kcal/mol, of the same order as the dif-
ference with the MP2 results. This serves to validate the
PBE functional, as well as SIESTA and the approxima-
tions involved (cut-oﬀ bases, pseudopotentials, grid inte-
grations, etc), as a valuable and competitive tool com-
pared with standard, all-electron, gaussian-bases DFT
programs.

The current LDA and GGA implementations of DFT
are not able to describe accurately Van der Waals or dis-
persion interactions. Still, the previous results show that
the common non-local XC functionals provide quantita-
tively accurate values of the interaction energies of the
hydrogen-bonded base-pairs. Although the reason for
this is not fully clear yet, it seems that the dispersion en-
ergies in these H-bonded systems are signiﬁcantly smaller
than the ones that would be predicted using an empirical
London dispersion energy21. It is still unclear if current
XC functionals are able to describe the interaction be-
tween stacked base-pairs, where the dispersion energy is
larger than expected from an empirical London formula.
Calculations by ˇSponer and coworkers4 seem to indicate
that the Becke3LYP functional signiﬁcantly underesti-
mates the dispersion energies for stacked base pairs. A
study of the performance of other XC functionals with
our method is underway, and will help in clarifying this
issue.

To conclude this section, we show in Table III the
dipole moments for the HF/6-31G** geometries. We
compare the results of the HF/6-31G** calculations of
ˇSponer et al.21 with those of this work. DFT provides
lower values, due to the tendency of the Hartree-Fock
approximation to overestimate the electrostatic interac-
tions.

IV. DFT GEOMETRY OPTIMIZATIONS

At present, DFT studies of the geometries of base-pairs
are rather scarce. To our knowledge, only the geometries
of the Watson-Crick TA and GC, and the CC base-pairs
have been obtained with DFT. Therefore, we have ex-
tended the previous DFT works, and performed a thor-
ough study of the energetics and structural relaxations
of nitrogenated base-pairs with our DFT approach. Here
we describe the results of such structural optimizations
for the 30 hydrogen-bonded base-pairs (27 of which had
not been studied with DFT previously).

A. Isolated bases

We have ﬁrst optimized the geometries of isolated ade-
nine, guanine, cytosine and thymine using our method.
The results for the geometries obtained (bond distances
and angles) are presented in Tables IV-VII. For com-
parison, we also show the DFT results of Santamar´ıa
and V´azquez27 (S-V), obtained with the Vosko-Wilk-
Nusair40 functional with Becke-Perdew41 non-local cor-
rections, as well as the experimental values obtained with
X-ray diﬀraction for crystallized DNA42,43. The bases
were relaxed for planar geometries.

We can observe that the geometries obtained here are
close to those of S-V with an all-electron calculation with
gaussian bases and a diﬀerent XC functional. Again, this
supports the reliability of SIESTA and its approxima-
tions. The bond distances obtained in this work are usu-
ally slightly larger than the values of S-V, although the
largest diﬀerence is only 0.016 ˚A. The results of S-V are
slightly closer to the experimental data. These must be
taken only as a rough reference, since they correspond to
measurements of DNA crystals; packing forces constrain
the molecules, so all the bond distances are shorter than
those calculated for the free bases. Some of the diﬀer-
ences between our results and those of S-V are due to
the restriction of planarity in our calculation, which was
not imposed by S-V. It is well known that the amino
groups of the nucleic acid bases suﬀer a pyramidalization
due to partial sp3 hybridization10,36: the two H atoms
go out of the plane of the aromatic ring whereas the N
atom moves in the opposite direction. Therefore, there
are in some cases important diﬀerences in the distances
and angles that involve atoms in the amino groups of the
bases between the planar and non-planar bases.

B. Base-pairs

Here we discuss our results for the structural optimiza-
tions of the base-pairs performed with the SIESTA pro-
gram. Our relaxations start from HF/6-31G** geome-
tries, with the exception of GG2 and GC2 base-pairs,
(not stable at the HF/6-31G** level) for which we start

from the HF/MINI-1 coordinates.
symmetry was imposed in the relaxations.

In all cases, planar

Table VIII shows the H-bonds distances and angles
for the base-pairs obtained with our method. Donor-
acceptor and donor-hydrogen distances are shown, to-
gether with the angle subtended by the three atoms in-
volved in the bond. Comparing with HF/6-31G** ge-
ometries (see Ref. 21), we see that hydrogen bridges are
shorter and donor-H distances are larger in our calcula-
tions.

Among the hydrogen bonds in the base-pairs studied,
33 are N(H)· · ·N and 29 are O· · ·(H)N. Their distances
range from 2.755 to 3.169 ˚A. Among the longest of them,
there is a clear majority of N(H)···N, which seems logical
because the electrostatic attraction between the H atom
and a N atom should be weaker than the attraction be-
tween H and O. However, there are also some N(H)· · ·O
bonds that are quite long. The reason is that several fac-
tors and interactions, and not only the atoms which are
involved in the H-bond, inﬂuence the ﬁnal conﬁguration
of the pairs.

Distances between donor and H atoms range from
1.026 to 1.070 ˚A. There is in many cases a correlation
between short H-bond distances and long donor-H dis-
tances. It is clear that the greater the electrostatic attrac-
tion the H atom suﬀers from the other base, the longer
will be its distance from the donor atom and vice-versa.
However, again this cannot be taken as a strict rule, as
the ﬁnal position of each atom is determined by all the
neighboring atoms.

The dipole moments at the geometries relaxed with
our approach are shown in Table III. They are all smaller
than the HF/6-31G** values, except for two of the bases,
and there are no major diﬀerences with the results ob-
tained with SIESTA for the HF/6-31G** geometries, al-
though there is in almost all cases a slight increase in
their values.

Table IX shows the interaction (Eint) and total sta-
bilization (ET ) energies for the base-pairs, obtained at
the SIESTA relaxed coordinates. The ordering of the
base-pairs is the same as the one of Table II, to facili-
tate comparison. Interaction energies range from -32.2
to -9.6 kcal/mol, and stabilization energies from -27.7 to
-8.0 kcal/mol. The most stable base-pair is GCWC, in
agreement with previous results21,35, and the ordering of
the next three base-pairs is also the same. The relative
ordering (according to Eint) of all the TA, GT, GG, GA,
AA and TT tautomeres is conserved, but AC2 is more
stable than AC1 and TC2 more stable than TC1 with
our method.
It is interesting to see that the energetic
ordering depends on which of the two energies is used,
Eint or Et. This is not the case in MP2//HF results21,
where only two base-pairs change position when ordered
according to Eint instead of Et (although the ordering
could change further if the geometries were obtained at
the MP2 level, too).

Several points are worth noticing from the results of
Table IX. (i) The interaction energies are systematically

5

larger (by a few kcal/mol) than those obtained, with the
same theory, at the HF/6-31G** geometries (compare
with the results of Table II). This indicates that the
geometry of the H-bonded base-pairs conﬁgurations are
more sensitive to the details of the calculation than those
of the free bases, and that the HF/6-31G** geometries for
the H-bonds are not fully optimal for DFT calculations.
(ii) The deformation energies (diﬀerence between ET and
Eint) are larger than those obtained at the HF/6-31G**
and MP2 levels for HF/6-31G** geometries. In our cal-
culations, the deformation energy ranges up to as much
as 6.7 kcal/mol for the GCNEW pair. The same trend is
observed in other DFT calculations (see below). (iii) The
GG2 and GC2 base-pairs, which at the HF/6-31G** are
unstable and converge towards the GG1 and GCNEW
respectively, are found to be stable in our geometry op-
timization, which was started from HF/MINI-1 coordi-
nates. The interaction energy of these pairs is small, but
comparable to many of the other base-pairs.

To our knowledge, DFT optimizations of base-pairs
by other authors are only available for GCWC,TAWC
and CC21,27. Tables X, XI and XII present the available
DFT results together with those of SIESTA and HF/6-
31G**, for these three pairs. For CC, results of a MP2
geometry optimization are also available from the work of
ˇSponer et al.21, and are included in Table XII. Acceptor–
donor and donor–hydrogen distances are shown, together
with the interaction and stabilization energies. In gen-
eral, our results report donor-acceptor distances which
are only slightly shorter than those of other DFT calcu-
lations (with a maximum diﬀerence of 0.058 ˚A), whereas
the donor-H distances are in excellent agreement. All
DFT results yield shorter D-A distances than the HF/6-
31G** approximation. For the energies, the dispersion in
the DFT reports is considerable. Our results agree quite
well with those of ˇSponer et al.21 (available for GCWC
and CC), whereas the diﬀerences with those of Santa-
mar´ıa and V´azquez27 (available for GCWC and TAWC)
are larger. We note that, as mentioned before, defor-
mation energies are considerably larger in all the DFT
results than in the MP2//HF results. For instance, for
GCWC, the DFT calculations yield values of the defor-
mation energies of 3.3, 4.8 and 4.7 kcal/mol, whereas the
MP2//HF result is of only 2.1 kcal/mol.

It is interesting to discuss the case of CC, since it is
the only base-pair where coordinates optimizations at the
MP2 level are available. We see in Table XII that the
bond length between the donor and acceptor atoms is
underestimated by the DFT calculations, and overesti-
mated by the HF/6-31G** by about the same amount.
However, it seems that the DFT energies are closer to the
MP2 values at the MP2 geometries than at the HF ones.
Also, the MP2 deformation energy increases from 1.3
kcal/mol for the HF/6-31G** geometries to 1.8 kcal/mol
for the MP2 geometries, and therefore approaching that
obtained with DFT (2.3 kcal/mol in the results of ˇSponer
et al. and 2.4 kcal/mol in our case).

V. CONCLUSIONS

In this work, we have performed DFT calculations on
the DNA bases adenine, guanine, cytosine and thymine,
and 30 base-pairs formed by these bases. The calcula-
tions were performed with the SIESTA code, which is
a novel technique for DFT calculations in systems with
large numbers of atoms using pseudopotentials to de-
scribe the eﬀect of the core electrons and ﬁnite range
basis orbitals for the valence electrons. The calculations
presented here serve to validate our method for the study
of H-bonded base-pairs, as a ﬁrst step toward the com-
plete DNA helix (which is feasible with SIESTA due to
the linear scaling of the numerical eﬀort with the number
of atoms in the system).

For calculations on the HF/6-31G** geometries, ex-
cellent agreement with MP2 results was obtained. The
deviations are smaller than 8% (which amounts to 1.3
kcal/mol at most), except for GG4,which diﬀers quite
signiﬁcantly from MP2 results. Calculations with longer
atomic orbital radii reduce the diﬀerence, but it is still
bigger than the rest. The dipole moments for these ge-
ometries are systematically lower than those of the HF
calculations.

For the isolated bases, the planar geometries obtained
in our calculation are in good agreement with former
DFT results.

The relaxed geometries of the 30 DNA base-pairs were
also obtained with our method. The donor-acceptor dis-
tances in the hydrogen bonds are systematically shorter
than those of HF/6-31G**, as in other DFT calcula-
tions27,21. Our results compare well with other DFT op-
timizations of the GCWC and TAWC base-pairs. For the
CC pair, for which MP2 optimizations are available, the
results of SIESTA and other DFT calculations slightly
underestimate the hydrogen bond distances, but provide
a quite accurate value for the interaction energies. The
deformation energies upon the dimer formation are larger
for the DFT results than for the HF geometries, a result
that is in agreement with the increase of Edef in the
MP2 approximation when MP2 coordinates are used in
the calculation.

Dipole moments for the relaxed geometries are quite
similar to our previous results for HF geometries, but
slightly larger in most cases.

The results for the energetic ordering of the base-pairs
have also been analyzed. Although there are not essen-
tial changes, the ordering is slightly diﬀerent than for the
MP2//HF results. However, the relative order between
tautomers is conserved in most cases. The GG2 and GC2
base-pairs, which were unstable at the HF/6-31G** level,
are stable in our calculations, and have interaction ener-
gies similar to the other base-pairs.

In conclusion, the results presented here show that
SIESTA is a valuable tool for the study of H-bonded DNA
base-pairs. It provides results very similar to other DFT
techniques, and which compare very well with the avail-

30 For attaining a desired degree of convergence, the cutoﬀ
radii of the diﬀerent orbitals depend on the species, and
also on the speciﬁc orbitals themselves. We have proposed
a systematic way of ﬁnding the diﬀerent cutoﬀ radii as a
function of a single parameter that deﬁnes the ﬁnite-range
approximation: the energy shift19. All pseudoatomic or-
bitals shift upwards in energy when conﬁned to a sphere;
deﬁning this energy shift gives all the required radii, guar-
anteeing a balanced basis.

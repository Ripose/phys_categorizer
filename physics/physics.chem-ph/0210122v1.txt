Inﬁnitely-fast diﬀusion in Single-File Systems

S.V. Nedea,∗ A.P.J. Jansen,† and J.J. Lukkien‡
(Dated: August 11, 2013)

We have used Dynamic Monte Carlo(DMC) methods and analytical techniques to analyze Single-
File Systems for which diﬀusion is inﬁnitely-fast. We have simpliﬁed the Master Equation removing
the fast reactions and we have introduced a DMC algorithm for inﬁnitely-fast diﬀusion. The DMC
method for fast diﬀusion give similar results as the standard DMC with high diﬀusion rates. We have
investigated the inﬂuence of characteristic parameters, such as pipe length, adsorption, desorption
and conversion rate constants on the steady-state properties of Single-File Systems with a reaction,
looking at cases when all the sites are reactive and when only some of them are reactive. We ﬁnd
that the eﬀect of fast diﬀusion on single-ﬁle properties of the system is absent even when diﬀusion
is inﬁnitely-fast. Diﬀusion is not important in these systems. Smaller systems are less reactive and
the occupancy proﬁles for inﬁnitely-long systems show an exponential behavior.

I.

INTRODUCTION

In one-dimensional systems such as zeolites or other
porous structures, diﬀusion is a very important process.
The pores of these structures that have the cross section
somewhat larger than a benzene molecule, are modelled
by Single-File Systems. In these systems particles move
in a concerted fashion, as they are unable to cross each
other. This process of Single-File diﬀusion has diﬀerent
characteristics from ordinary diﬀusion which aﬀects the
nature of both transport and conversion by chemical re-
actions. In [1] and [2] we have studied the steady-state
and transient properties of this system. We have anal-
ysed diﬀerent situations for diﬀusion rates and we have
compared the results obtained from simulation and ana-
lytical techniques. Often diﬀusion is a very fast process
compared to the other reactions in the system. We are
thus interested to be able to model correctly inﬁnitely-
fast diﬀusion. For this purpose, we used DMC methods
with high regular diﬀusion rates, assuming that these
rates are high enough to model inﬁnitely-fast diﬀusion.

Dynamic Monte Carlo methods for very high rates are
not very eﬃcient and the progress of the simulation is
slow. Moreover, considering regular reactions rates it is
always a problem to balance between making the diﬀu-
sion rates high enough so that the inﬁnitely-fast diﬀusion
eﬀects are correctly modelled and the performance of the
simulation. We derive here a new method to simulate
inﬁnitely fast-diﬀusion in Single-File Systems, starting
from the Master Equation.

The rate equations of some special limiting cases and
an analytical description for the productivity of the sys-
tem are also derived. We study also how the system be-

havior changes for diﬀerent sets of kinetic parameters and
diﬀerent distributions of the reactive sites. We categorize
also interesting results obtained for proﬁle occupancies
for diﬀerent reactive system and diﬀerent distribution of
the reactive sites.

In section II we specify our mathematical model with
the theoretical background for the analytical and simu-
lation results. We introduce the Master Equation of the
systems in section II B and then we simplify the Mas-
ter Equation removing the fast reactions in section II C.
In section II D 1 and II D 2 we present the simulation
methods and we present a DMC algorithm for inﬁnitely-
fast diﬀusion. Diﬀerent analytical results are presented
in III. In section IV A and IV B we analyze diﬀerent
simulation results for the case when all the sites are re-
active and when only some of the sites are reactive. We
pay special attention to the inﬂuence of the length of the
pipe and reaction rate constant on the site occupancy of
the system.

II. THEORY

In this section we will give the theoretical background
for our analytical and simulation results. First we will
specify our model and we will derive a ﬁnite set of ex-
act rate equations starting from the Master Equation [3].
These rate equations are used in order to derive expres-
sions for the productivity in the system for special cases.
We show that we can simplify the Master Equation de-
scribing the evolution of the system over time removing
fast reactions. We use Dynamic Monte Carlo method
for our simulation results and we give the description of
a Dynamic Monte Carlo-like algorithm for inﬁnitely-fast
diﬀusion.

A. The Model

We model a Single-File System by a one-dimensional
array of sites, each possibly occupied by an adsorbate.

This is the model of diﬀusion and reaction in a one-
dimensional arrangements of particles with hard-core in-
teraction. The sites are numbered 1, 2, . . . , S. A particle
can only move to the right or to the left if an adjacent
site is vacant. The sites could be reactive and unreactive
and we note with Nprot the number of reactive sites. A
reactive site is the only place where a conversion may
take place.

We consider two types of adsorbates, A and B,
in
our model and we denote with Y the site occupation
of a site, Y=(∗, A, B), which stands for an vacant
site, a site occupied by A, or a site occupied by a B,
respectively. We restrict ourselves to the following mono
and bi-molecular transitions.

By α, β, we will indicate a particular conﬁguration of
the system i.e., a particular way to distribute adsorbates
over all the sites. Pα(t) will indicate the probability of
ﬁnding the system in conﬁguration α at time t and Wαβ is
the rate constant of the reaction changing conﬁguration
β to conﬁguration α.

The probability of the system being in conﬁguration
α at time t + dt can be expressed as the sum of two
terms. The ﬁrst term is the probability to ﬁnd the sys-
tem already in conﬁguration α at time t multiplied by
the probability to stay in this conﬁguration during dt.
The second term is the probability to ﬁnd the system in
some other conﬁguration β at time t multiplied by the
probability to go from β to α during dt.

a) Adsorption and desorption

Adsorption and desorption take place only at the
two marginal sites i.e., the left and rightmost sites at
the ends of the system.

A(gas) + ∗m −→ Am
Am −→ A(gas) + ∗m
Bm −→ B(gas) + ∗m ,

where subscripts m denotes a marginal site. Note that
there is no B adsorption. B’s can only be formed by a
conversion.

By taking the limit dt → 0 this equation reduces to a

Master Equation:

=

[WαβPβ(t) − WβαPα(t)] .

(2)

Analytical results can be derived as follow. The value
of a property X is a weighted average over the values Xα
which is the value of X in conﬁguration α:

In the pipe, particles are allowed to diﬀuse via hopping
to vacant nearest neighbor sites.

An + ∗n+1 ←→ ∗n + An+1
Bn + ∗n+1 ←→ ∗n + Bn+1

where the subscripts are site indices: n=1, 2, . . . , S-1.

c) Conversion

An A can transform into a B at a reactive site.

Ar −→ Br .

In the initial state of the system all the sites are va-
cant (no particles in the pipe) as we are interested in the
behavior of the system towards equilibrium.

B. Master Equation

Reaction kinetics is described by a stochastic process.
Every reaction has a microscopic rate constant associated
with it that is the probability per unit time that the
reaction occurs. Stochastic models of physical systems
can be described by a Master Equation. [3]

From this follows the rate equation

C. Master Equation for inﬁnitely-fast diﬀusion

We show that we can simplify the Master Equation re-
moving the fast reactions. In order to remove fast reac-
tions we stop distinguishing between conﬁgurations that
can be transformed into each other by the fast reactions.
We split all conﬁgurations into disjoint sets such that
if Ci is one such a set and α, β ∈ Ci, then α can be
transformed into β, or vice versa by fast reactions. If we

We see that all fast reactions have disappeared; they
only contribute to ωii, which can be left out of the ME. In
order to calculate ωij, we need the conditional probabil-
ities Pβ
. Because we have fast reactions connecting the
πj
β’s in Cj we may assume that these β’s are in steady-state
with respect to each other. Hence, the conditional prob-
ability Pβ
is nothing but the probability of β in steady-
πj
state if we restrict ourselves to the conﬁgurations in Cj .

D. Simulation methods

1. Dynamic Monte Carlo

DMC methods allow us to simulate the system gov-
erned by the Master Equation over time. We simplify the
notation of the Master Equation by deﬁning a matrix W
containing the rate constants Wαβ, and a diagonal ma-
trix R by Rαβ ≡
γ Wγβ, if α = β, and 0 otherwise.
If we put the probabilities of the conﬁgurations Pα in a

P

dP
dt

= −(R − W)P.

(6)

where R and W are time independent. We also introduce
a new matrix Q, Q(t) ≡ exp[−Rt].

This matrix is time dependent by deﬁnition and we

can rewrite the Master Equation in the integral form

(5)

P(t) = Q(t)P(0) +

dt′Q(t − t′)WP(t′).

(8)

Suppose at t = 0 the system is in conﬁguration α
with probability Pα(0). The probability that, at time
t, the system is still
in conﬁguration α is given by
Qαα(t)Pα(0) = exp(−Rααt)Pα(0). This shows that the
ﬁrst term represents the contribution to the probabilities
when no reaction takes place up to time t. The matrix W
determines how the probabilities change when a reaction
takes place. The second term represents the contribution
to the probabilities when no reaction takes place between
times 0 and t′, some reaction takes place at time t′, and
then no reaction takes place between t′ and t. The sub-
sequent terms represent contributions when two, three,
four, etc. reactions take place. The idea of the DMC
method is not to compute probabilities Pα(t) explicitly,
but to start with some particular conﬁguration, represen-
tative for the initial state of the experiment one wants to
simulate, and then generate a sequence of other conﬁgu-
rations with the correct probability. The method gener-
ates a time t′ when the ﬁrst reaction occurs according to
the probability distribution 1 − exp[−Rααt]. At time t′ a

reaction takes place such that a new conﬁguration α′ is
generated by picking it out of all possible new conﬁgura-
tions β with a probability proportional to Wα′α. At this
point we can proceed by repeating the previous steps,
drawing again a time for a new reaction and a new con-
ﬁguration. [4, 5] One of the most popular DMC method
in the literature is Random Selection Method(RSM) [4].
We use this method to simulate the Master Equation of
our system.

2. A Dynamic Monte Carlo algorithm for inﬁnitely-fast
diﬀusion

In section C we have derived the ME distinguishing
between conﬁgurations that can be transformed into each
other by fast reactions. Starting from the ME(5) we give
a DMC algorithm for simulating inﬁnitely-fast diﬀusion.
For our model, diﬀusion is much faster than adsorption
and desorption, so the sets are all conﬁgurations that
are connected by diﬀusion. These sets can be labeled
only by the sequences of particles A and B, as only the
number of A and B particles and their order in the pipe
is important to distinguish the conﬁgurations within a
set. Moreover, all probabilities of conﬁgurations within
a set are the same. This means that πj
is the number of
Pβ

conﬁgurations in Cj. There are

S
n(cid:19)
n particles over S sites. We have then

(cid:18)

ways to distribute

with Pβ ∈ Cn. The summation

conﬁgurations. However, for adsorption the left-most
or the right-most site should be vacant.This gives us

sums over

possible conﬁgurations. Each of these gives just

(cid:18)
one conﬁguration in the summation over α. So we get

(9)
where ωads is the transition probability for the transition
from a conﬁguration within the set with n particles to a
conﬁguration within the set with n+1 particles. Similary
we ﬁnd that

In both expressions θ = n

S is the coverage.

The Dynamic Monte Carlo (DMC) algorithm that we
have used to simulate the system consists of the following
steps:
1. Compute the time for the next adsorption or des-
orption. If the current time is t then the time for that
process is t + ∆t with

∆t = −

ln r
2(1 − θ)Wads + 2θWdes

(11)

where r is a random number picked from the uniform
distribution on the interval h0, 1] and θ is the probability
that the marginal site is occupied. With inﬁnitely fast
diﬀusion this probability is given by θ = (NA + NB)/S
with NA and NB the number of A’s respectively B’s in
the system.
2. Compute for each A in the system a time when it will
transform into a B. This time is given by t + τ with

τ = −

ln r
P Wrx

.

(12)

In this expression P stands for the probability that the
A is at a protonic site. If we number the particles in the
system from left to right 1, 2, . . . , NA + NB and the sites
also from left to right 1, 2, . . . , S then the probability that
particle number n is at site number s, P s

n, is given by

s − 1
n − 1(cid:19) (cid:18)

S − s
NA + NB − n(cid:19)

(cid:18)

P s

n =

(13)

S
NA + NB(cid:19)

(cid:18)

P for particle n is then the sum of this expression over
all protonic sites

P =

P s

nδs,

S

Xs=1

(14)

where δs = 1 if site s is protonic.
3. Change those A’s with τ < ∆t into B’s.
4. Determine the next process at the marginal sites.
It is an adsorption with probability proportional to
(1 − θ)Wads and a desorption with probability propor-
tional to θWdes. The process is equally likely to occur on
the left- or the right-hand-side.
5. Change the number of particles in the system accord-
ing to the next process at the marginal sites.
6. Update the time.
7. Repeat steps 1 to 6.

III. ANALYTICAL RESULTS

In this section, for some special cases such as low load-
ing limit and fast and slow reaction, we are able to derive
some expressions for the productivity in the steady-state.
For the case of low loading limit we can also derive the
rate equations of the system.

A. The low loading limit.

In this case we can assume that there is never more
than one particle in the system. The following rate equa-
tions then hold.

Comparing the site occupancy with B’s(20) with re-
sults from the DMC simulations, we ﬁnd that for the
reaction rate constants (Wads=0.03333, Wdes=0.96667,
Wrx=10 and all the sites reactive, the results are similar.
If the reaction is slow, then there are only occasionally

B’s in the system. This means

From this we immediately get the turnover frequency

(17)

We see that in this limit the turnover frequency does not
depend on the system size.

Comparing the number of B’s produced from the an-
alytical results with the DMC results for the case when
Wads = 0.0033, Wdes = 0.9967, Wrx = 0.1 and diﬀerent
distributions of the reactive sites, we remark that we get
similar results.

B. Fast and slow A → B reaction.

If the reaction is fast, and there are not too many par-
ticles in the system, then all particles in the system are
Bs. This means

The restriction of not too many particles is necessary,
because particles should all always be able to reach a

must hold. This relation depends on the distribution of
the reactive sites. When reaction is fast this means that
it depends on the distance from the margins to the ﬁrst
protonic site.

Comparing the site occupancy with A’s(23) with re-
sults from the DMC simulations, we ﬁnd that for the
reaction rates constants Wads=0.03333, Wdes=0.96667,
Wrx=0.001 and all the sites reactive, the results are sim-
ilar.

IV.

SIMULATION RESULTS AND

DISCUSSION

A. All sites reactive

We remark that DMC methods with regular high rates
for diﬀusion tend to give similar results as DMC method
for inﬁnitely-fast diﬀusion described in section II D 2.
The results of this comparisons are in ﬁgure 3. We con-
clude that the DMC method for inﬁnitely-fast diﬀusion
we have deﬁned is a correct method to simulate the be-
havior of the system in the limit Wdiﬀ → ∞.

In [1] we have seen that for the case when all the sites
are reactive, the site occupancies of the system obtained
from DMC simulations show that the system is not ho-
mogeneous even for very fast diﬀusion rates. We ﬁnd
the same eﬀect also using DMC for inﬁnitely-fast diﬀu-
sion, for diﬀerent loadings and for diﬀerent reaction rate
constants.

We study also the dependence of the occupancy proﬁles
on the reaction rate constant at diﬀerent loadings of the
system.

The simulation results in ﬁgure 2 show how the shape
of the proﬁles changes with reaction rate Wrx for high
and low loading of the pipe, when all the sites are reac-
tive. We ﬁnd that for high loadings, as an eﬀect of the
blocking, the middle sites have the same probability to
be occupied for both fast and slow reactive system. Only
the occupancy of marginal sites is inﬂuenced by the reac-
tivity, such that in fast reactive systems we have a higher
probability to have a B near the marginal sites, and, in
consequence, a better productivity. For slow reactive sys-
tems, the occupancy proﬁles are scaled with reaction rate
constant. We notice that the productivity is growing in-
creasing reaction rate in case of low loading systems al-
most as fast as in the case of the high loading systems

because of the diminished eﬀect of the blocking in the
pipe. Comparing for instance the rate o growth for B
production when reaction rate constant is increasing from
Wrx = 0.1 to Wrx = 0.4 (BWrx=0.4
)/S), in
case of low loading (θ = 0.2) and high loading (θ = 0.8),
we ﬁnd almost the same rate of growth in both the cases,
and this is 0.5.

In ﬁgure 4 we have the logarithmic shape of the oc-
cupancy proﬁles for A and B. These proﬁles show that
smaller systems are less reactive as less As are inside the
pipe. This explains the faster decrease of hAni for small
systems in ﬁgure 4. For inﬁnitely-long systems we expect
to have straight lines corresponding to an exponential de-
crease of hAni.

B. Only some of the sites reactive

For all the sites reactive, in paper [1], we have shown
that even when Wdif f → ∞, DMC results with regu-
lar high diﬀusion rates indicate that the system doesn’t
become homogeneous. Using DMC for inﬁnitely-fast dif-
fusion we ﬁnd that also for diﬀerent distribution of the

reactive sites we ﬁnd a non-homogeneous distribution of
the particles in the system. In ﬁgure 5 we can see that
for marginal sites reactive and for middle sites reactive
as well, we have single-ﬁle eﬀects also for inﬁnitely-fast
diﬀusion for diﬀerent rates of reactions.

We notice that the proﬁles in case of high loadings are
very slowly dependent on conversion, both for middle and
for marginal sites reactive. Comparing with simulation
results for occupancy proﬁles in [1], where middle sites
and marginal sites are reactive, and for regular diﬀusion
rate constants in the domain (2 . . . 10), we notice that the
proﬁles are similar. We can conclude that as the eﬀect of
inﬁnitely-fast diﬀusion is absent for Single-File Systems,
the diﬀusion is not so important in these systems.

For low loading, when marginal sites are reactive, the
occupancy proﬁles are scaled with Wrx. We notice that
conversion in ﬁgure 5 is the rate determining step. In this
case, the middle sites doesn’t have the same occupancy

for diﬀerent reaction rate constants like in the case of all
the sites reactive but are strongly dependent on Wrx.

We notice also that the productivity in case marginal
sites are reactive is growing faster increasing the reac-
tion rate constants at low loadings than at high loadings.
Comparing, for instance, the rate o growth for B pro-
duction Bprod when reaction rate constant is increasing
from Wrx = 0.1 to Wrx = 0.4, in case of low loading
(θ = 0.2) and high loading (θ = 0.8), we ﬁnd that the
rate of growth of B productivity at low loadings (0.3) is
larger than at high loadings (0.25).

When we have middle sites reactive we have higher
probability to ﬁnd A’s near marginal sites. The produc-
tivity is smaller than in all the other cases. The proﬁles
are again scaled with Wrx for low loadings. For high
loadings and middle sites reactive, the proﬁles for diﬀer-
ent conversion rates are almost similar, so the productiv-
ity can only be increased in this case only increasing the
number of reactive sites.

V. SUMMARY

We have used DMC methods and analytical tech-
niques to analyze Single-File Systems for which diﬀusion

is inﬁnitely-fast. We simpliﬁed the ME removing fast
diﬀusion and we have presented a DMC algorithm for
inﬁnitely-fast diﬀusion that simulate this ME. We show
that DMC with regular high rates gives the same results
as DMC for inﬁnitely-fast diﬀusion. The fundamental
assumption considered for inﬁnitely-fast diﬀusion in the
analytical results is that all conﬁgurations related by dif-
fusion have the same probability.

In the limiting cases such as low loading limit and slow
and fast conversion, we are able to derive expressions for
the B productivity. We notice that the number of Bs
produced per unit time in these cases doesn’t depend
on the system size. Comparisons between analytical and
DMC results reveal similar results for the productivity.

DMC results show that when all the sites are reactive
and when only some of the sites are reactive, diﬀusion
has no inﬂuence on the single-ﬁle properties of the sys-
tem. Diﬀerent results for the dependencies of the oc-
cupancy proﬁles and productivity on the reaction rate
constant and diﬀerent distributions are categorized. The
occupancy proﬁles show that smaller systems are less re-
active as less As are inside the pipe.

FIG. 5: Dynamic Monte Carlo results for site occupancy for the case of inﬁnitely-fast diﬀusion.The ﬁrst two ﬁgures(a,b) are
for the case of 5 marginal sites reactive at each end and the last two(c,d) for the case of 10 middle sites reactive. The ﬁrst
ﬁgure is for the case of low loading (Wads = 0.2, Wdes = 0.8), and the second for high loading (Wads = 0.8, Wdes = 0.2) at
diﬀerent reaction rates (Wrx = 0.1, 0.2, 0.4). The third and the fourth ﬁgures are for the same parameters as the ﬁrst and the
second, but for the case of 10 middle sites reactive.

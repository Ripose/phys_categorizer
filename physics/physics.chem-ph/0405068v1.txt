Homochirality proliferation in space

(Received January 3, 2014)

To understand the chirality selection in the biological organic system, a simple lattice

model of chemical reaction with molecular diﬀusion is proposed and studied by Monte Carlo

simulations. In addition to a simple stochastic process of conversions between an achiral

reactant A and chiral products, R and S molecules, a nonlinear autocatalysis is incorporated

by enhancing the reaction rate from A to R ( or S), when A is surrounded by more than one R

( or S) molecules. With this nonlinear autocatalysis, the chiral symmetry between R and S is

shown to be broken in a dense system. In a dilute solution with a chemically inactive solvent,

molecular diﬀusion accomplishes chirality selection, provided that the initial concentration

is higher than the critical value.

Organic molecules often have two possible stereo-structures, i.e. a right-handed (R) and

a mirror-image left-handed (S) form, but those associated with living matter choose only
one type: only L-amino acids and D-sugards.1, 2 There are many studies on the origin of
this chirality selection.1 Various mechanisms proposed to cause asymmetry in the primordial
molecular environment ( by chance or by external or internal deterministic factors)2–8 turned

out to be very minute, and therefore it has to be ampliﬁed.

Frank has shown theoretically that an autocatalytic reaction of a chemical substance with

an antagonistic process can lead to an ampliﬁcation of enantiometric excess (ee) and to ho-
mochirality.9 Recently, ampliﬁcation of ee was conﬁrmed in the asymmetric autocatalysis of
pyrimidyl alkanol,10–13 and the temporal evolution was explained by the second-order auto-
catalytic reaction.12, 13 In various other systems such as crystallizations, the chiral symmetry
breaking is found and discussed extensively.14

In our previous paper,15 we have shown that in addition to the nonlinear autotacalysis a

recycling process of the reactant introduced by the back reaction accomplishes the complete

homochirality. There, however, chemical reaction is analyzed macroscopically in terms of aver-

age concentrations. Thus, a very important factor is neglected, namely the spatial distribution

of the chemical components; one cannot understand how the homochirality is established over

the system. In this paper, we study the chemical reaction of molecules in an extended space

to understand the proliferation of chirality selection.

Model and Elementary Processes

In order to understand the essentials of the chirality selection, we propose here a sim-

ple model such that the space is restricted to two dimensions and is devided into a lattice.

Molecules are treated as points moving randomly on the lattice sites. Double occupancy of a

lattice site is forbidden. There involve four types of molecules in the present minimal model;

an achiral reactant A, two types of product enantiomers R and S, and a solvant in a diluted

system. As for the chemical reaction, three typical cases are analyzed; nonautocatalytic, lin-

early autocatalytic and secondary autocatalytic cases. The back-reaction is always included

in those three cases.

The non-autocatalytic chemical reaction proceeds on site and independently of neighbor-

ing molecules, as illustrated schematically as

A ⇋ R
A ⇋ S

A

R

The reaction process is essentially stochastic, and we simulate it by the Monte Carlo method.

In the mean-ﬁeld approximation where the ﬂuctuation is neglected, the process is described
by the rate equation in terms of the local concentrations r(i), s(i) and a(i) of R, S, and A
molecules at a site i as

with a constant production rate k0 and a decay rate λ. The rate equation is very powerful in

theoretical analysis. In this non autocatalytic case, for example, enantiomer concentrations are

shown to approach to values at a symmetric ﬁxed point r∞ = s∞ = k0a∞/λ, asymptotically.

Since the double occupancy of a lattice site is forbidden in the present lattice model, it is

natural to assume that these autocatalytic reactions take place when an A molecule is located

In addition to the above chemical reaction processes, diﬀusion of molecules is important if

the reaction system is diluted in chemically inactive solvent. We assume in the following that

the diﬀusion is essentially mediated by the solvent molecules.

Monte Carlo simulation

In order to analyze the complex reaction-diﬀusion system in an spatially extended situa-

tion, numerical simulation is useful. We adopt a Monte Carlo simulation in two dimensions

with a following scheme.

As for the initial condition, A molecules with a concentration c0 are distributed randomly

on a square lattice of a size L × L, and the remaining sites are assumed to be occupied by

the solvent. Periodic boundary conditions are imposed in the x and y-directions, and the

length is measured in terms of a lattice constant, hereafter. Then the Monte Carlo simulation

starts. One selects randomly a site among L × L square lattice sites. If it is occupied by an A

molecule, one tries the reaction from A to R with a probability k(A → R) and from A to S

with a probability k(A → S). If the A molecule is isolated, k(A → R) = k(A → S) = k0. If it

is surrounded by one R molecules, k(A → R) = k0 + k1, and by more than one R molecules,

k(A → R) = k0 + k1 + k2. The similar procedure holds when it is surrounded by one or more

than one S molecules as k(A → S) = k0 + k1 and k(A → S) = k0 + k1 + k2, respectively. If

the randomly selected site is occupied by an R or S molecule, it is converted to an A molecule

with a probability λ.

In addition to this reaction algorithm, we can include the diﬀusion process, if necessary.

A pair of nearest neighboring sites is chosen randomly, and only if one of them is occupied

by a solvent molecule, the molecules on the chosen pair sites are exchanged. We assume no

special bonding among A, R and S molecules, and their diﬀusion constant is the same, for

simplicity. Their proximity in space only aﬀects the chemical reaction. Direct exchange among

A, R and S molecules is excluded so as to realize the diﬀusionless reaction in the c0 = 1 case.

One Monte Carlo step (MCS) corresponds to L × L trials of chemical reaction and diﬀusion,

and thus, on average, each molecule tries reaction and diﬀusion steps once per each MCS. The

diﬀusion constant is D = 1/4 in this time and space unit.

Results and analysis for the case without diﬀusion

For the chirality selection, the macroscopic rate equation shows that the nonlinear auto-

catalysis plays an essential role. We ﬁrst perform simulations only with chemical reaction to

check if our simulation model has the chiral symmetry breaking. The system simulated has a
size L = 100 with parameters k0 = λ = 10−3, and we change the initial concentration c0 and
the parameters k1 and k2 in order to ﬁnd out the role of autocatalytic reaction.

Without diﬀusion, it is obvious that the result depends strongly on the density c0 of the

reactive molecules. Denser the reactive molecules are, more dominates the nonlinearity. The

extreme of the dense system is the one without solvent, c0 = 1; a whole lattice sites are

initially occupied by A molecules. At c0 = 1 without autocatalysis as k1 = k2 = 0, Monte

Carlo simulation shows that the numbers of R and S molecules increase synchronously, and

each saturates about one third of the total lattice sites. The saturation values corresponds

to the concentrations at the ﬁxed point of the rate equation (1); r∞ = s∞ = k0c0/(λ + 2k0)

and a∞ = λc0/(λ + 2k0), with the initial concentration c0 = 1. The asymptotic spatial

conﬁguration (not shown) is completely irregular, since a molecule on every sites changes its

state independent of each other. The enantiomatic excess, ee, is deﬁned, as usual, by the

diﬀerence in the concentrations of R and S molecules as

Without autocatalysis it ﬂuctuates around zero.

With a linear autocatalysis as k1 = 100k0 but k2 = 0, the reaction has produced more R

conﬁguration, but the chiral symmetry is not broken; φ ﬂuctuates around zero, as shown in

Fig.2(d). If the spatial dependence is neglected, the corresponding rate equations are written

= (k0 + 4k1s)a − λs

supplimented with the conservation that the sum of the concentrations of A, R and S molecules

is ﬁxed to its initial value c0; a + r + s = c0. This rate equation has a symmetric ﬁxed point:

r∞ = s∞ = (c0 − a∞)/2 ≈ (c0/2) − (λ/8k1) under the assumption of a strong autocatalysis,
k0 ≈ λ ≪ k1. With the present parameters, c0 = 1, k0 = λ = k1/100 = 10−3, the asymptotic
values r∞ = s∞ = 0.499 are expected, in fair agreement with the simulation result. Of course,

in this case, the chiral symmetry should be conserved as the simulation conﬁrms.

With a second-order autocatalysis with k2 = 100k0 but k1 = 0, the chiral symmetry breaks

as is shown in Fig.2(a-c). In the simulation shown, there are more R molecules (Fig.2(b)) than

S (Fig.2(c)). By using another sequence of pseudo-random numbers, there occurs equally cases

that the enantiomer S dominates over R. By neglecting the space dependence the expected

rate equations are written as

which is close to unity in the present parameter values, k2 = 100k0 and c0 = 1. In the

simulation, the ee increases gradually as shown by an upper curve in Fig.2(d), but the ﬁnal

asymptotics is not reached yet.

On looking into the spatial distribution of molecules, one ﬁnds that the sites occupied by R

and S molecules form respective domains. The chirality selection proceeds via the competition

between two domains. The process is very slow and the conﬁguration in Fig.2(a-c) shows an

intermediate stage of the S domain shrinking. If both R and S domains extend the whole

system, the relaxation process becomes even slower. The situation looks quite similar to the

slow domain dynamics observed in the spinodal decomposition.

One may notice that the ee in eq.(7) is complete if the nonautocatalytic production is
absent (k0 = 0), in agreement with our previous study.15 In the present model, we assume
a ﬁnite value of k0, since the creation of an initial chiral molecule R or S from an achiral

molecule A is necessary. Also without k0, the accidental extinction of the chiral species, R or

S, is unavoidable and it cannot be recovered only with autocatalytic reactions.

We now consider the reaction and chirality selection in a solution with c0 < 1. The reaction

system is diluted by adding inactive solvent molecules. If the initial concentration of reactant

c0 is suﬃciently high, the nonlinear autocatalysis leads to the chiral symmetry breaking similar

to the case at c0 = 1. On the other hand, at a low concentration far below the percolation
threshold of the square lattice16 cp ≈ 0.6, the autocatalysis eﬀect cannot propagate through
the whole system and fails to break the chiral symmetry. For example, at c0 = 0.15, the

numbers of A, R and S molecules are about the same with each other as shown in Fig.3(a),

(b) and (c), respectively. There is no cooperative organization, and the ee ﬂuctuates around

zero, as shown in Fig.4(d).

Results and analysis for the case with diﬀusion

Diﬀusion drastically changes the above situation at low densities. Figures 4(a), (b) and

(c), show conﬁgurations of A, R and S molecules, respectively, at the concentration c0 = 0.15
with diﬀusion and nonlinear autocatalysis at the time 3 × 104th MCS. The parameter values
are D = 1/4, k0 = λ = 10−3, k1 = 0, k2 = 100k0, and the system size is L2 = 1002. The R
molecule in Fig. 4(b) increases their number at the cost of A and S molecules in Fig.4(a) and

(c). The ee approaches to the saturation value φ∞ ≈ 0.73 very quickly. At the ﬁxed point of the

rate equation (6), the approximate value of the ee, φ, is given by eq.(7) as 0.871, quite larger
than the simulation result. However, since k2c2
0 is comparable to k0, the asymptotic form (7)
is no more valid and the exact value is calculated to be 0.806, closer to the simulation result.
We have simulated larger system with sizes L2 = 2002 and L2 = 4002 with k2 = 100k0, and
found that the ee becomes non zero as well, though for a large system the initial incubation

period with vanishing φ remains very long in some cases. It indicates that there is a certain

critical size of coherence for the chiral symmetry breaking to take place, and the diﬀusion

kinetics controls the propagation of symmetry breaking through the system.

With a linear autocatalysis and diﬀusion, our simulation shows that the chiral symmetry

will not be broken in the diluted system. Therefore, both the nonlinearly autotalytic reaction

together with recycling and the diﬀusion seem to be necessary for the chiral symmetry breaking

in a dilute solution.

As we lower the concentration, the value of the ee decreases, and at concentrations lower

than a critical value about cc ≈ 0.12, the system cannot sustain the state with broken chiral

symmetry. This is also expected from the rate equations (6): it has no symmetry-broken

solution below the critical concentration

In fact, this is more clearly understood from the time evolution of the ee, derived from

Here a is the time-dependent concentration of A molecule. The term proportional to k2 in

eq. (9) represents that the nonlinear autocatalysis ampliﬁes the chiral symmetry breaking,

whereas the term proportional to k0 suppresses the chiral symmetry breaking by the random

and independent production of enantiomers, R and S. The state with chiral symmetry looses its

stability when the coeﬃcient of the linear term in φ in the right-hand side of eq.(9) is positive,

and the state with a ﬁnite ee, φ, can emerge. Since c0 − a represents the total concentration

of R and S molecules which is close to the initial concentration c0, the nonlinear symmetry

breaking eﬀect becomes weak for a dilute system, and below the critical concentration the

random creation of racemics dominates.

As for the critical concentration, there seems to be a discrepancy between the simulation

result and the rate equation analysis. Since the rate equation corresponds to the mean ﬁeld

approximation without ﬂuctuation, the critical concentration in the simulation might turn out

to be a little larger than the theoretical prediction. Another possibility is the ﬁniteness of the

diﬀusion constant. In the rate equation, we assume a homogeneous situation, corresponding

to an inﬁnitely fast diﬀusion. With a ﬁnite diﬀusion, the system is inﬂuenced by the spatial

ﬂuctuation. There are also many other possibilities; ﬁnite simulation time and size in the Monte

Carlo simulation, etc. More studies are required on the critical behaviors of this dynamical

phase transition.

Summary

We have proposed a simple lattice model of chemical reaction with molecular diﬀusion,

and studied the chirality selection. The nonlinear autocatalysis is shown to be indispensable

for the selection. In a diluted solution, molecular motion such as diﬀusion is necessary to

accomplish the selection. In nature, molecules are in water and the convection should provide

much more eﬃcient molecular movement. If the initial concentration of the reactant c0 is

too low, below the critical concentration, one can produce only racemic mixture of R and S.

The critical concentration depends on the ratio of the non-autocatalytic to the nonlinearly

autocatalytic rate coeﬃcients, k0/k2. The asymptotic ee value φ diﬀers from the complete

φ = 1 by a factor proportional to k0/k2. If the initial production of R or S molecules from

the reactant A is triggered by minute external eﬀect, k0 might be very small and the almost

complete homochirality be achieved.

In the whole analysis, the back reaction from the chiral products, R and S, to the reactant

A is always assumed. Without it, the reaction stops before attaining the full selection, since

the reactant A is consumed up. The recycling is necessary to develope the selection. But it

should be smaller than the critical value λc = 2k0(c0

6k2/k0 −2) in order that the symmetry-

broken states exist. As λ is much too small, the system takes a long relaxation time to reach

p

the broken-symmetry state. There seems to be an appropriate range of values of λ to achieve

the chiral symmetry breaking.

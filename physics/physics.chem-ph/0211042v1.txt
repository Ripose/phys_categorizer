running title: Flux Correlation Approach

Flux Correlation Approach to Thermal Reactions
and Recombination Rates

Abstract

The rate constants for recombination and exchange processes are studied in

terms of two diﬀerent ﬂux correlation approaches: one is the Yamamoto approach,

which is based on the linear response theory, and the other is the Miller one. Using

those approaches we consider two exactly solvable cases, i.e., the free particle and the

parabolic potential models. Since the rate constants for recombination and exchange

processes are calculated by Laplace transforms of the ﬂux correlation functions, the

two approaches give diﬀerent results. In the present calculation, we ﬁnd that the

rate constant in the Yamamoto approach is larger than that in the Miller approach

by about 40% at low temperature (

100 K) and high pressure (

1 GPa). The

diﬀerence is considerable in the region where quantum eﬀects dominate.

When one wants to study a chemical reaction at the most detailed level, it is neces-

sary to calculate the Schr¨odinger equation for a state-to-state diﬀerential scattering cross

section, which is a function of total energy E and total angular momentum J. Such

quantum reactive scattering cross sections have actually been studied for simple chemical

reactions, where a time-dependent scattering formalism based on the S-matrix Kohn vari-

ational approach1 or a coupled channel method in hyperspherical coodinates2 has usually

been used.

However, in chemical applications, there are many cases where only the (microcanoni-

cal or canonical) rate constant for a reaction is needed. If the full, state-to-state scattering

calculation has been carried out, the rate constant is, of course, given by an average of

the cross sections. If it is, however, only the rate constant that is desired, such a complete

calculation for all state-to-state information is not economical. Furthermore, because of

the rapid growth of the number of open vibration-rotation channels with increasing ther-

mally accessible collision energies, the calculation of a rate constant via exact quantum

state-to-state calculations would not be feasible even for a simple reaction.

The traditional way of evaluating a rate constant is the transition state theory (TST).3

However, TST is a classical theory and it is approximate, because it does not involve the

eﬀect of recrossing of the system over the transition state dividing a potential surface. A

number of improvements have been proposed to take the recrossing eﬀect into account.4, 5

In the early 60’s, Yamamoto6 ﬁrst formulated an exact expression for the rate constant

as an application of the general statistical mechanical theory of irreversible process, which

was established by Kubo et al.7 and Mori.8 Later (in the early 70’s), Miller et al.5, 9

separately developed a method for the rate constant using a time integral of the ﬂux-

ﬂux autocorrelation function, which is exact in the limit that the dynamics is extended

to t

. Because the ﬂux-ﬂux correlation is calculated via time-dependent quantum

mechanics, the feasibility of this approach depends on how to evaluate the Hamiltonian,

ﬂux and time evolution operators for the system. The ﬂux-ﬂux autocorrelation function

method has been applied to a variety of chemical reactions.10 In particular, the reaction

Here the process is aﬀected by the bath gas M. Some applications of this new theory are

The purpose of this paper is to study the diﬀerence between the way proposed by

Yamamoto,6 which is based on the linear response theory or the so-called Kubo formula,7

and the ﬂux-ﬂux autocorrelation function method proposed by Miller et al.5, 9 The two

approaches can provide the same result to the rate constant for a simple chemical reaction,

because it is given in terms of the integral of the ﬂux-ﬂux correlation function with respect

to time.5, 9 However, the shapes of the correlation functions calculated by the two methods

are quite diﬀerent from each other. For the recombination and exchange reactions (like

eqs.(3) and (4)), the rate constants in the two approaches could be diﬀerent because they

are evaluated by Laplace transforms of the ﬂux-ﬂux correlation functions. It is expected

that the diﬀerence will appear in the region where quantum eﬀects dominate.

3

In this paper, we ﬁrst review the correlation function method brieﬂy and show the

diﬀerence between Yamamoto’s and Miller’s approaches explicitly. The rate constants for

recombination and exchange processes are also discussed. Next, we study two exactly

solvable cases, i.e., the free particle and the parabolic potential models. Finally, the

summary and conclusion are given.

1 Flux-ﬂux correlation approach to rate constants

In the classical limit, a rate constant is generally given by an average of the ﬂux through

some dividing surface that separates reactants from products (see Fig.1). The canonical

rate constant is then given by10†

kcl(T ) = Qr(T )−1(2π)−f

P

where β−1 = kBT (T , temperature) and (~p1, ~q1) provides the initial conditions of the

momenta and (reaction) coordinates for classical trajectories of the system (consisting

of f degrees of freedom). The system is described by the Hamiltonian H(~p1, ~q1). Here

Qr(T ) is the partition function per unit volume for the noninteracting reactants and F is

the ﬂux factor which describes the trajectories crossing the dividing surface speciﬁed by

s(~q) = 0:

F (~p, ~q) =

h(s(~q)) = δ(s(~q))vs,

(6)

d
dt

where s(~q) is some function of position ~q that is negative on the reactant side and positive

on the product side. Then, h(s) is the step function, which is +1(0) for s > (<)0, and

vs is the normal component of the velocity to the dividing surface s(~q). The factor

in

P

eq.(5) involves all information of the dynamics and it is unity when the trajectory is on

the product side in the inﬁnite future and zero otherwise. This implies that it is given by

(~p1, ~q1) = lim

This means that the rate constant is calculated by the time integral of the ﬂux-ﬂux

autocorrelation function Ccl(t).

To take quantum eﬀects into account, it is necessary to replace the phase space integral

by a quantum trace representation. In the linear response theory,7 the response functon

is usually deﬁned as

φBA(t) =

itr(ρ[A, B(t)]),

−

(10)

where ρ = e−βH /tr(e−βH ) is the density operator for an equilibrium state. After the

perturbation by the operator A at t = 0, the response of the quantity B(t)(= eitH Be−itH )

at time t in the system is described by the response function φBA(t). For the ﬂux-ﬂux

autocorrelation function, one can identify that A = h(s) and B(t) = F (t). Here F (0) is

the ﬂux operator at t = 0, which is given by9

F (0) = i[H, h(s)] =

δ(s) + δ(s)

with p the momentum operator and m the reduced mass of the system. Thus, the response

In the present notation, C(t) in eq.(18) corresponds to the ﬂux correlation proposed by

Yamamoto.6 We should note that there exists an integral with respect to λ which stems

from the Kubo identity and that it is dispensable in the classical limit β

0. Because

→

it is more convenient to use the commutation relation in eq.(12) rather than eq.(18) in

actual calculations, we re-deﬁne the Yamamoto’s correlation function by

C Y (t) =

tr(e−βH[h(s), F (t)]),

(19)

1
iβ

where the superscript Y stands for “Yamamoto”.

By contrast, in Miller’s approach5, 9 the variable λ in the ﬂux is ﬁxed to be β/2 and

the λ integral is performed. Thus, from eq.(18) Miller’s correlation function is given by

C M (t) = tr(F (0)eit∗

c H F (0)e−itcH ),

(20)

where tc = t

iβ/2 and the superscript M stands for “Miller”. This modiﬁcation certainly

−

makes actual calculations simple, because the ﬂux operators are involved symmetrically in

the correlation function. In fact, Yamamoto’s correlation function C Y (t) is not identical

to C M (t). However, their integrals with respect to time are identical to each other, and

hence they can provide the same rate constant. Therefore, the way of Miller et al.5, 9

certainly has some distinct advantages in actual numerical calculations.

2 Rate constants for recombination and exchange

reactions

It is possible to generalize the ﬂux correlation approach to treat recombination and ex-

change reactions.10, 12, 13 It may be intuitive and useful to begin with the classical de-

scription of the process again. Let us consider the reaction of A + BC

AB + C and

ABC (see Fig.2). The classical rate constants for the exchange (A + BC

AB + C) and

→

→

recombination (A + BC

ABC) reactions are again given by eq.(5), i.e., averages of the

→

ﬂux Fr(~p1, ~q1) and the probability

(~p1, ~q1) over the Boltzmann distribution. Here Fr is

the ﬂux at the reactant dividing surface sr (see Fig.2):

Fr =

h(sr) = δ(sr)vr.

(21)

P

d
dt

Note that h(sr) is again the step function, which is 0(1) for position ~q to the left (right) of

the dividing surface sr, and that vr is the normal component of the velocity to the surface

sr. Similarly we deﬁne the step function for the product dividing surface sp by h(sp) (see

Fig.2), that is, h(sp) = 0(1) for position ~q to the left (right) of the dividing surface sp.

The diﬀerence of those step functions, hc(~q) = h(sr(~q))

h(sp(~q)), is unity for position ~q

−

between the two dividing surfaces (i.e., in the “compound” region) and zero outside.

Because the probability of the system experiencing a deactivating (ABC ∗ + M

ABC + M) collision with the bath gas M can be evaluated by 1

e−ηt at time t (η

in Miller’s approach. Note that Fi(0) (i = r or p) is the quantum mechanical ﬂux, which

is again given by eq.(11) with δ(si) and h(si), instead of δ(s) and h(s).

Because the rate constant is calculated by the Laplace transform of the ﬂux-ﬂux au-

tocorrelation function, it is clear that the two approaches give diﬀerent results.

It is

expected that they will coincide with each other in the classical limit, but the diﬀerence

becomes large in the region where the λ integration in eq.(18) cannot be ignored.

3 Numerical calculations

In this section we calculate the (canonical) rate constants for recombination and exchange

reactions using the Feynman path integral technique.16 A huge calculation is usually re-

quired to obtain the exact matrix elemens of propagators for a realistic system. Fur-

thermore, it is necessary to consider some approximations and numerical techniques like

Monte Carlo samplings17 to perform it. Because the aim of this paper is to show how the

rate constant in the Miller approach is diﬀerent from that in the Yamamoto case, it would

be more intuitive and useful to consider a simple system rather than a complicated case.

We here study two analytically solvable cases:

i.e., the free particle and the parabolic

potential models in one-dimension, and leave more elaborate calculations for nontrivial

cases for a forthcoming paper.

3.1 Free particle case

We ﬁrst study the free particle case (see Fig.3). The propagator for the free particle in

a coordinate representation can be easily calculated by the path integral.16 The matrix

element of the ﬂux operator Fi(i = r or p) in coordinate space is also found easily for the

free particle system. For details, see Appendix A.

with d the distance between sr and sp (see Fig.3). Note that the correlation depends on

only the distance d and is independent of positions sr and sp, as it should be. From this

expression the correlation function C M

rr (t) is easily obtained as

C M

rr (t) =

β
8π(t2 + β2/4)3/2 .

(37)

(38)

Those correlation functions are illustrated by the dotted curves in Figs.4 and 5, in which

we deﬁne C1 = md2/2β and take C1 = 1.0 to illustrate the correlation functions clearly.

The rate constant for the reaction without recombination (i.e., in the limit η

0) can be

time it is divergent like

only the distance d. If we set sr = sp (or d = 0), we obtain10

and, as expected, we can ﬁnd that for the usual rate constant the Yamamoto correlation

function gives Qrk(T ) = 1/2πβ, which is the same as that in the Miller approach (see

eq.(38)). Those correlation functions are shown by the solid curves in Figs.4 and 5.

It can be seen from Figs.4 and 5 that the interference eﬀect in the correlation is taken

into account correctly in the Yamamoto approach (although the vibrating behavior is

10

inconvenient for numerical calculations). Contrastingly, in the Miller correlation function

the interference is averaged and the shape is quite smooth. Thus, it is very convenient for

actual computation. For the usual rate constant, the two approaches certainly give the

same result, as we have seen above.

Next, we calculate the rate constants for recombination and exchange reactions. The

rate constants are given by eqs.(30) and (31). If we deﬁne the (rr)- and (rp)-rate constants

calculation, we have also evaluated the rate constant for the free particle with η = 0

and compared the result with the exact value given by eq.(38). It is conﬁrmed that the

numerical calculation is suﬃciently accurate.) In Rrr, the ratio is enhanced at low T and

high P , where quantum eﬀects dominate, as we ﬁrst expected in section 2. The ratio

reaches 1.38 at T = 100 K and P = 1 GPa. Hence, the diﬀerence between the Yamomoto

and the Miller approaches becomes rather large in the region of low T and high P . This

tendency can be seen clearly in the contour plot of Rrr. On the contrary, in Rrp the ratio

is reduced in the region where the quantum eﬀect is strong. It is about 0.53 at T = 100

K and P = 1 GPa. The contour plot shows the decreasing behavior of Rrp at low T and

high P .

Combining the (rr)- and (rp)-rate constants, one can calculate the ratio of the recom-

bination rate constants, Rrec = kY

rec/kM

rec. The ratio is presented in Fig.8. (Note that the

12

ratio for the exchange process is given by Rexc = kY

exc/kM

exc = Rrp.) The behavior of Rrec

seems similar to Rrr and the ratio again reaches 1.38 at T = 100 K and P = 1 GPa. From

the contour plot we can see that there is a small diﬀerence between Rrec and Rrr.

3.2 Parabolic potential case

The second example is a reaction which occurs under a harmonic oscillator potential.

We suppose that the potential has a frequency ω, the minimum point at x0 with its

value V0, and sr and sp are located symmetrically with respect to the minimum point

(see Fig.9). The propagator for a particle moving under the potential can be found by

the path integral.16 The ﬂux-ﬂux autocorrelation function in the Miller approach is then

calculated by (for details, see Appendix B)

Note that in the limit ω, V0 →

Figs.10 and 11.

One can see from the ﬁgures that the correct behavior of the correlation function

is quite complicated and it is divergent (like

1/√u) at u = 0, π, 2π,

. However, the

∼

Miller correlation function is smooth everywhere and it never diverges. All those functions

are periodical because of the harmonic oscillator potential and, as expected, the integral

of the correlation function over one period vanishes.

The rate constants for recombination and exchange reactions are calculated by Laplace

transforms of the correlation functions. In the Miller approach, the (rr)- and (rp)-rate

constants are given by

Now we show our results of the parabolic potential case. In Figs.12 and 13, the ratios

Rrr and Rrp are illustrated. In the present calculation, we ﬁx κ to be 0.05, which means

that the potential energy of the harmonic oscillator is much weaker (about 5%) than the

typical thermal energy β−1. We should note that the frequency ω is varied so as to keep

κ = 0.05 at each T . If we set κ to be smaller than 0.05 (for example, κ = 0.01), the ratio,

as it should, becomes close to that of the free particle case.

In Fig.12, the ratio is again enhanced at low T and high P , which is similar to the

result of the free particle case. The ratio at (T, P ) = (100K, 1GPa) is about 1.38. One

distinct feature in the parabolic case is an enhancement of the ratio in the region of high

T and low P . This can also be seen in the contour plot. In such a region, the power α

appearing in Laplace transform for the rate constant is small, and hence the rate constant

at high T and low P is more inﬂuenced by the correlation function at large t than that

at other T and P , that is, the rate constant is considerably aﬀected by the (second)

complicated structure around u

π in the correlation function (see Figs.10 and 11). This

∼

is the reason why the enhancement at high T and low P appears in the ratio. The ratio

at (T, P ) = (400K, 0.1GPa) is about 1.11. In Fig.13 a similar tendency can be seen: the

ratio is reduced at low T and high P (Rrp = 0.58 at (T, P ) = (100K, 1GPa)), which is

similar to the free particle case, while it is enhanced at high T and low P (Rrp = 1.43 at

(T, P ) = (400K, 0.1GPa)).

Combining the (rr)- and (rp)-rate constants, we can calculate the rate constant for

the recombination process; this is presented in Fig.14. In Rrec, the ratio is enhanced at

low T and high P (Rrec = 1.38 at (T, P ) = (100K, 1GPa)), while it is reduced at high T

and low P (Rrec = 0.38 at (T, P ) = (400K, 0.1GPa)). This behavior is also seen in the

contour plot.

4 Summary and Conclusion

The exact quantum mechanical expression for thermal reaction rates can be formulated

by the linear response theory,7, 8 which Yamamoto ﬁrst discussed in the early 60’s.6 Later,

in the early 70’s, Miller et al.5, 9 have independently proposed a more convenient way to

perform numerical computation, which can provide the exact rate constant in the limit

that the dynamics of the system is extended to t

.

→ ∞

We have studied the diﬀerence between the two approaches in thermal reactions which

involve exchange and recombination processes. Because the rate constants in those reac-

tions are calculated by Laplace transforms of the ﬂux-ﬂux autocorrelation functions, the

results evaluated by the two approaches are diﬀerent. In this paper, we have considered

two solvable cases, i.e., the free particle and parabolic potential models, to demonstrate

the diﬀerence intuitively. We have found that the shapes of the correlation functions

are quite diﬀerent in the two approaches and that the diﬀerence of the rate constants

appears in the region where quantum eﬀects dominate. In both the free and parabolic

cases, the rate constant for recombination in the Yamamoto approach is larger than that

in the Miller approach; the enhancement becomes about 40% at low temperature and

high pressure.

Kubo identity.

In conclusion, the Miller method is certainly an economical and powerful tool to

perform numerical calculations for thermal rates of realistic reactions. However, it may

underestimate the rate constants for recombination and exchange processes in the region

where quantum eﬀects dominate, because of neglecting the λ integral appearing in the

Abstract

The potential energy surface (PES) describing the interactions between Li2(1Σ+

u ) and 4He and an exten-

sive study of the energies and structures of a set of small clusters, Li2(He)n, have been presented by us in a

previous series of publications [1, 2, 3]. In the present work we want to extend the same analysis to the case

of the excited Li2(a3Σ+

u ) and of the ionized Li+

2 (X 2Σ+

g ) moiety. We thus show here calculated interaction

potentials for the two title systems and the corresponding ﬁtting of the computed points. For both surfaces

the MP4 method with cc-pV5Z basis sets has been used to generate an extensive range of radial/angular

coordinates of the two dimensional PES’s which describe rigid rotor molecular dopants interacting with one

He partner.

INTRODUCTION

The accurate evaluation of the interaction potential between a dopant molecule or ion and a

single He atom is an important step in the study of small-size doped helium clusters because it

can be used to set up the total potential acting within them, an essential ﬁrst step in determining

their structure and dynamics. Nano-sized helium droplets in which a molecular or an atomic

impurity has been added by means of picking up techniques provide, indeed, a unique environment

for high precision spectroscopic studies of the molecular solute [4] especially for weakly bound

molecular species [5, 6, 7] that are otherwise difﬁcult to analyze. Among the many dopants that

have been experimentally and theoretically analyzed, the alkali metal atoms and dimers have many

interesting properties: from experimental [5, 7, 8] and theoretical [1, 3, 9] evidence it turns out

that they normally reside on the surface of an 4He droplet, usually forming a slight “dimple” on

that surface. When two or more alkali atoms are attached to the droplet they eventually meet on its

surface forming a singlet or a triplet molecule. Spectroscopic identiﬁcation of the molecules shows

[6] that dimers in the triplet state outnumber the singlet molecules by a factor up to 105. This is

probably due to the differences in stability between the triplet dimers and the singlet molecules

[6] whereby the energy release due to the formation of a singlet molecule is more likely to lead to

the detachment of the molecule and to the almost complete disappearance of this kind of dopant.

A similar behaviour, i.e. one in which high spin states are preferred, has been noticed also in

the formation of small clusters of alkali atoms grown on helium droplet surfaces [10]: the very

small binding energies to the surface allows for a spontaneous “selection” of the cluster in higher

spin states (it is worth pointing out that, in these experiments, lithium atoms were shown to form

only dimers while heavier alkalis produced also larger structures). Very recently experiments have

been also performed on alkali atoms in 3He droplets [11] where both theoretical predictions and

experiments [12] have shown a very similar behavior to that of the bosonic moieties. The possible

formation of cold heteronuclear molecules has attracted the attention of researchers in the last few

years (see for example the special volume edition in which Ref. [13] can be found) because of

the possibility of studying the effects of polar interactions in cold or even quantum degenerate

molecular samples: helium droplets may therefore allow the spectroscopic study of weakly bound

(triplet) heteronuclear dimers.

In all the experiments mentioned above, the helium droplet is used as a convenient, but inert

matrix in which weakly bound molecular species are accumulated and studied. Helium droplets,

2

however, can also be used as microscopic cryo-reactors which actively initiate series of chemical

reactions. Very recently, in fact, it has been shown possible to follow chemical reactions inside

a helium droplet [14] using, among others, simple diatomic dopants. The chain of reactions is

usually initiated by the ionization of one of the helium atoms [14] with an ensuing charge transfer

[15, 16, 17] process that moves the charge onto the impurity because its ionization potential is

usually lower than He. The impurity gives rise, in turn, to a variety of further, secondary chemi-

cal reactions: the excess energy due to any exothermic reaction is rapidly thermalized within the

droplet itself by helium atom evaporation. The rapid quenching of the internal degrees of freedom

of the partner species afforded by the superﬂuid environment of the droplets has a profound effect

on the various branching reactions and, in some cases, can ultimately stabilize different interme-

diate complexes which would instead only remain as transient species in the gas phase. The latter

condition therefore becomes an interesting feature of such nanoscopic cryostats in the sense that

any further step initiated by ionization of the cluster can follow speciﬁc pathways which are likely

to be different from those under the corresponding gas phase conditions.

Concerning the experiments involving neutral dopants, we believe that the microscopic struc-

ture of the helium surface-dimer complex is a key piece of information for the full understanding

of the experimental data. In this work we continue the analysis of the lithium-He system by pre-

senting an accurate Potential Energy Surface (PES) for the dimer in the triplet state Li2(3Σ+

u ) and

one Helium atom.

When moving to the problem of ionic dopants, and therefore to the fascinating possibility of

conducting ionic reactions at low temperatures in the droplet, the study of the microscopic struc-

ture of the solvation site around the ionic molecule may also help the understanding of the possible

reactive pathways which are eventually followed. This is the reason why, together with the pre-
viously mentioned PES, we also want to present here similar calculations on the Li+

2 (2Σ+

g ) − He

system. These two PES’s may be considered as the building blocks of the complex interactions at

play in the He droplets or in smaller helium clusters: they describe two rather extreme situations of

either a weak, dispersion-type interaction or of a much stronger, markedly orientational ionic PES.

Although the forces at play in the large systems may be extremely difﬁcult to compute, a simpli-

ﬁed approach where the total potential is obtained as a sum of two-body potentials represents a

realistic route because the three-body forces and the higher order terms, especially for the neutral

system, provide fairly negligible contributions to the total energies. For their possible relevance in

ionic systems see e.g. Refs. [18] and [19] for further details.

II. THE AB-INITIO CALCULATIONS

Both surfaces have been calculated using the MP4(SDTQ) method (without freezing the lithium

core) with the cc-pV5Z basis set employed within Gaussian03 [20]. All energies have been cor-

rected for BSSE using the Counterpoise procedure [21]. Since, in either case, the distortion due to

the helium atom over the electronic structure of the molecule is rather weak, we have decided to

keep the molecule at its equilibrium geometry. The optimal geometry of the molecular species was
determined by a separate MP4 optimization on both the triplet Li2 and ionic Li+
distances that we have used are r = 4.175 ˚A and r = 3.11 ˚A for Li2 and Li+

2 . The internuclear

2 respectively. For

both surfaces we have used a grid of Jacobi coordinates with different radial geometries and 19

angles from 0 to 90. For the Li+
2 −He case we have calculated for each angle a number of points
between 50 and 64 (2.5 ≤ R ≤ 12.0 ˚A ) for a total number of 1,135. For the Li2−He system the
number of radial points for each angle varied from 30 to 80 (2.0 ≤ R ≤ 14.0 ˚A ) for a total of 847

points.

III. THE FITTING PROCEDURE

In order to make it easier to employ the two potential energy surfaces in further studies,we

have decided to obtain a suitable analytical ﬁtting of the raw points using a non-linear ﬁtting

procedure based on the minimization of the square deviation, as obtained by means of the efﬁcient

Levenberg-Marquadt method [22].

The full interaction can be written as

Vtot = V (Ra, θa) + V (Rb, θb) + VLR(R, θ)

where the coordinates are those reported for clarity in Figure 1. The ﬁrst two contributions repre-

sent the anisotropic interactions at short range and are written in terms of Legendre polynomials

where the fN damping functions are those deﬁned within the well-known Tang-Toennies empirical

potential modeling [23].

For the neutral system (Li2-He) we have employed nmax = 4 and lmax = 6 and we have

limited the long range expression to the value N = 6, i.e. the latter was simply given by two terms

VLR = f6(βR) · R−6 · [P0(cosθ)C LR

60 + P2(cosθ)C LR
62 ].

This very simple analytical representation of the entire set of unweighted 847 ab-initio points
yielded a standard deviation of 0.0046 cm−1. For the ionic system (Li+

2 -He) we have employed a
more ﬂexible representation given by nmax = 8 and lmax = 4 and two long range anisotropic

terms: C4 and C6. The latter terms were employed in order to represent correctly the long range

multipolar expansion of a neutral, polarizable atom interacting with a point-like charge ion. The

long range expansion therefore becomes:

VLR = f4(βR) · R−4 · [P0(cosθ)C LR

40 ] + f6(βR) · R−6 · [P0(cosθ)C LR

60 + P2(cosθ)C LR
62 ].

The total number of 1,135 points was reduced to 1,065 by excluding the repulsive energies with
values above 5,000 cm−1. A simple weight function W (E) was used in order to obtain a better

representation of the interaction region and to reduce the importance of the repulsive geometries.

Hence we drop the weight of the points in the less important highly repulsive regions of the inter-

action

The ﬁnal standard deviation was 0.073 cm−1. As an example of the accuracy of the two ﬁttings

we report in Figure 2 (neutral system) and Figure 3 (ionic system) two selected cuts through the

PES’s at θ=0 and θ=90 and compare them with the ab-initio points. As is evident from the ﬁgures,

we are able to describe with good accuracy both the attractive region and the lowest section of

the repulsive wall. In either case, however, we were not able to provide reliable ﬁtting values for

R ≤ 1.0 ˚A . All the coefﬁcients are reported in Table I and Table II. Fortran77 subroutines are

IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

A. The Potential energy surfaces

A 3D representation of the two PES’s is presented in Figure 4 as isoenergetic contour plots. As

can be seen from the ﬁgure, the two PES’s are completely different in shape and in strength, as

one could easily have expected. The triplet interaction is very weak (very similar to the one we

have already calculated for the singlet molecule in Ref. [1, 3]) and has its absolute minimum at
θ=90 with an interaction energy of ∼ −2.4 cm−1. This is a very different anisotropy with respect

to that exhibited by the singlet dimer [1, 3], where the collinear conﬁguration provided the global

PES minimum energy and it also exhibits deeper well values than those of the former case. The

extreme weakness of the interaction of Li2 with He is indirectly supported by the experimental

ﬁndings [7] which indicate that triplet molecules also reside on the surface of the droplet and are

not efﬁciently solvated by the helium atoms.

Given the weakness of the calculated interaction it would be also be interesting to provide a

modiﬁcation of it that makes use of semi-empirical guesses for the two-body contribution due to

the Li-He interactions. We can, in fact, modify the calculated interaction energies by employing

2-body semiempirical potentials along the lines which we have already followed for the singlet

molecule in Ref. [3]. It is, in fact, possible to produce rather simply a semi-empirical potential
V ′(R, θ) by using the formula

V ′(R, θ) = V (R, θ) − V ab(Ra) − V ab(Rb) + V sm(Ra) + V sm(Rb)

where V sm(Ra,b) is the semi-empirical potential proposed by Toennies and coworkers [23] for the
dimer Li-He, V ab(Ra,b) is a simple ﬁtting of the ab-initio points calculated by us at the same level

of accuracy (MP4/cc-pV5Z) for the Li-He diatomic curve and Ra, Rb are the two Li-He distances

within the trimer. Our ab-initio data, the ﬁtting curve and the model potential of Ref. [23] for the
Li-He pair are reported in Figure 5. The resulting full potential energy surface V ′(R, θ) calculated

with the model potential is stronger than the one from purely ab-initio data, although the increase

in well depth is still not sufﬁcient to allow for possible solvation of the molecular impurity inside

the helium clusters (see also our similar conclusions for the singlet Li2 in Ref. [3]).

The ionic interaction reported in Figures 3 and 4, on the other hand, is much stronger and

presents its minimum at θ=0. Here the situation is completely different and, although no calcu-

lations have been carried out as yet for the cluster structures, it is not difﬁcult to see that the Li+
2

impurity would be strongly solvated in liquid helium droplets and therefore it is likely to get local-

ized at the droplet center with a solvation shell strongly bound to it (for analogous situations one

should look at the existing results on the ionic Li or Na impurities described in Refs. [18, 24]).

B. Estimating the 3-body effects in the ionic system

As we have pointed out in the introduction, in order to treat small and medium sized clusters

with 2-50 helium atoms, one should be able to rapidly evaluate the total potential energy acting

within them. One of the most used and successful approaches consists in approximating the total

interaction as a sum of 2-body terms, initially neglecting any non-separable 3-body contribution.

While this has been proved to be a very accurate procedure for doped helium clusters with a neutral

impurity, it may represent a source of error in ionic clusters where non-separable interactions

among the induced multipoles in the ﬁrst solvation shell may be important. However, it has been

recently shown in various works on ionic dopants in rare-gas clusters including helium that these

effects are small and should not, when included, alter substantially the geometries or the energies

of the clusters (for a general discussion with anionic dopants see refs.

[19] and [25, 26], for

positive ions see Refs. [18, 27]).

In order to verify the applicability of the sum-of-potentials approximation we have carried out

at a consistent level (cc-pV5Z/MP4) a series of ab-initio calculation on the Li+

2 He2 system for

11

which such 3-body effects may arise. The analysis carried out here is analogous to what we have

already reported in Ref. [27] for the LiH+ dopant. The 3-body forces should mainly originate from

the induced multipoles (attractive and repulsive contributions) and by the weaker Axilrod-Teller

effects [19]. For our preliminary study, we have therefore chosen four different geometries of the

complex where the two helium atoms are close enough to the ion molecule in order to contribute
signiﬁcantly to 3-body forces. The ﬁrst geometry (geometry A) is weakly repulsive (∼ 70 cm−1)
with the two helium atoms at 3.11 ˚A and is the upper one reported in the inset of Table 3. The

second (B) and the third (C) geometries are similar in shape to the second one sketched in the same

table, but they differ for the values of the distances between the atoms. The last one (geometry opt)

is also similar in shape to the latter, but it comes instead from a full minimization at the MP2/cc-

pv5Z level of the entire complex: all the relevant distances are reported in Table 3. The analysis of

3-body forces is done in the following way: for each geometry we calculate the interaction energy

of the entire Li+

2 He2 complex, of one of its 2-body fragments (there are two identical ones in

symmetrical geometries) Li+

2 He and of the remaining He2 dimer by using the following formulae

where the geometry is ﬁxed, it is the same in each fragment and the counterpoise correction is

used for each interaction energy:

V [Li+

2 He2] = E[Li+

2 He2] − E[Li+

2 ] − 2E[He]

V [Li+

2 He] = E[Li+

2 He] − E[Li+

2 ] − E[He]

V [He2] = E[He2] − 2E[He]

the residual 3-body interaction is simply calculated by using the expression

V [Li+

2 He2] − 2V [Li+

2 He] − V [He2].

As can be seen from Table 3, the 3-body interaction is always a small percentage of the total

interaction in the various geometries except for geometry A where it represents more than 10% of

the total interaction. It is however important to note that the geometry A corresponds to a repulsive

geometry for the Li+

2 -He fragment and therefore it is not relevant for optimization purposes.

molecules. The two molecules considered here are the triplet state of Li2 and the ground state
ionic Li+

2 . As should be expected, we found the two PES’s to be markedly different:

• the interaction of the neutral moiety is similar to the one we have already studied for ground

state singlet Li2 [1, 2]: a very weak interaction that conﬁrms once more the tendency of high

spin compounds of alkali metals to reside on the surface of helium droplets. A modiﬁed ver-

sion of the same interaction that gives rise to slightly deeper potentials can be obtained fol-

lowing our earlier proposal in Ref. [3] and also found to yield weaker interaction potentials

than those between He partners.

• the triplet dimer interaction with helium is showing here a markedly different anisotropy

is, in fact, given by T-shaped structures as opposed to the linear structures obtained for the

singlet interaction.

• the ionic interaction, instead, is much stronger and more orientation-dependent: it should

therefore lead to full solvation of the molecular moiety inside the droplets.

• a preliminary analysis of the three-body effects on the interactions with more He atoms

indicates that such effects are relatively small and should therefore allow the use of an
approximate description of the full potential energy landscapes in Li+

2 Hen clusters in terms

of two-body potentials.

Both surfaces have been ﬁtted using rather simple analytical expression reported in the present

paper and which therefore provide working quality interactions potentials for the title systems. We

believe that such potentials are an important step in the modelling of the larger clusters behavior

because they may be used to set up the total interaction for much larger systems whenever using the

sum-of-potential approach is found to be a realistic alternative: our present study and preliminary

analysis do seem to suggest that this may be the case for both the present system. We shall verify

such a possibility via our ongoing calculations for the doped 4He clusters.

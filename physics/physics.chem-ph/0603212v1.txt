Abstract

The stochastic Liouville equations are employed to investigate the combined signatures of chem-

ical exchange (two-state-jump) and spectral diﬀusion (coupling to an overdamped Brownian oscil-

lator) in the coherent response of an anharmonic vibration to three femtosecond infrared pulses.

Simulations reproduce the main features recently observed in the OD stretch of phenol in benzene.

INTRODUCTION

Recent experiments had demonstrated that two-dimensional infrared (2D IR) lineshapes

can probe the picosecond dynamics of chemical exchange by observing coherence trans-

fer in molecular vibrations through time-dependent spectral jumps1,2,3. This spectroscopic

technique4,5,6 is an optical analogue of 2D NMR commonly used to study slower (ms) chem-

ical exchange processes7,8,9,10. In this three-pulse experiment (Fig 1) the ﬁrst pulse creates

a vibrational coherence, whose evolution (free induction decay) during the ﬁrst interval t1

is related to the absorption lineshape by a Fourier transform. During the second interval

t2 the vibrational frequency changes by complexation with the solvent. Finally vibrational

coherence is again created by the third pulse and detected during the third interval t3. The

correlations of the lineshapes in the ﬁrst and the third intervals provide information on

chemical exchange taking place during the second interval.

One experiment1 looked at the OD stretching mode of phenol in benzene whose fre-

quency changes between 2665cm−1 (free) and 2631cm−1 (complexed). The 2D lineshapes
monitor the dynamics of complex formation and dissociation1. For short delays (t2 ∼
two diagonal peaks broadened by spectral diﬀusion were observed at the linear-absorption

100f s)

frequencies. Oﬀ-diagonal cross-peaks are induced by chemical exchange for longer times

(

10ps). Similar eﬀects were seen in the overtone region. The rate constants for complex-

∼
ation were directly obtained from the peak kinetics.

Similar hydrogen-bonding dynamics were also reported for the CN stretch of acetonitrile

in methanol3. The relative intensity of the two peaks attributed to free and hydrogen-

bonded CN shows strong temperature dependence. The reaction coordinate proﬁle in both

ground and excited vibrational states was found to be very similar. The weak variation of

the chemical exchange rates with changes in the vibrational state justiﬁes the application of

stochastic chemical exchange models11 for vibration frequency ﬂuctuations.

In this paper we use the stochastic Liouville equations (SLE) to simulate the eﬀects of

chemical exchange12,13,14 and spectral diﬀusion in 2D lineshapes of an anharmonic vibration.

This formalism was recently applied to model the signatures of conformational ﬂuctuations

in trialanine in water15 using a Brownian oscillator coordinate model of ﬂuctuations. The

SLE were also used to compare the Brownian oscillator and the four-state-jump model of

hydrogen bonding ﬂuctuation on the photon echo of the OH stretch of HOD in DOD16.

2

In section II we introduce the anharmonic vibrational Hamiltionian subjected to ﬂuctua-

tions due to a two-state chemical-exchange and a Brownian oscillator coordinate. In the two

state jump (TSJ) model of Kubo and Anderson7,17,18,19,20 bath-assisted (incoherent) chemi-

cal exchange is described by kinetic equations. The model shows several distinct dynamical

regimes depending on the motional narrowing parameter (ratio of the frequency shift and

relaxation rate). Spectral diﬀusion1 is incorporated by coupling to an overdamped Brow-

nian oscillator coordinate21. The 2D IR signals are deﬁned in section III. The stochastic

Liouville equation for the TSJ model is introduced in section IV and the 2D IR signals are

calculated for the limiting cases of slow and fast ﬂuctuations and for short and long-time

delays between pulses. The combined eﬀect of spectral diﬀusion and TSJ is presented and

analyzed in section V. All lineshape regimes observed in1 are qualitatively reproduced.

II. THE MODEL

We consider a single anharmonic vibrational mode described by the Hamiltonian:

where B† (B) are boson creation (annihilation) operators (
(cid:2)

(Ω) and anharmonicity (∆) are subjected to ﬂuctuations described by

B, B†

(cid:3)

= 1). Both frequency

H = ~ΩB†B + ~ ∆

B†B†BB

Ω = Ω0 + Ω1σz + Ω2Q + Ω3σzQ,

∆ = ∆0 + ∆1σz + ∆2Q + ∆3σzQ.

(1)

(2)

Ω0 and ∆0 are the average values. Ω1 and ∆1 describe stochastic frequency modulation
by chemical exchange represented by the TSJ model17,18 (state up u (σz = 1) and down d

(σz =

1)). σz is the Pauli spin matrix .

−

Q is an overdamped Brownian oscillator (BO) coordinate causing spectral diﬀusion and

coupled to the vibration through the parameters Ω2, and ∆2. Ω3, and ∆3 allow the spectral

diﬀusion to have a diﬀerent magnitude in the two spin states. We shall divide hamiltonian

(Eq. (1)) into three parts H = HSV + HQV + HQSV where HSV includes the ﬁrst two (spin-

vibration) terms in Eq.(2) which do not depends on Q, and HQV ,HQSV include the third

III. THE THIRD ORDER RESPONSE AND 2D SIGNALS

We consider an impulsive four wave mixing process whereby the vibrational mode (Eq.(1))

interacts with three impulsive optical pulses with intervals t1, t2, and calculate the response

at t3 (see Fig 1). Each interaction with the ﬁeld can create or annihilate one vibrational

quantum at a time (Eq(3)). The equilibrium distribution is

The linear response is given in Appendix A. Closed form expressions for the various pathways

are given in the Appendix B. Below we discuss the 2D signals for limiting cases.

In the slow bath limit Ω1 >> k (In Figs 2-6 k

kd = ku) no spin jumps occur during

the t1,and t3 intervals. In Fig 2a we display the 2D lineshapes SA (Eq.(10)). In all ﬁgures

≡

we give frequencies with respect to Ω0 (i.e. we set Ω0 = 0) and normalize the signal to have

maximum absolute value of 1. For kt << 1 no spin jumps occur during the t2 interval and
we only see 4 peaks (Fig 2a) two diagonal at ω1 = ω3 = Ω0 ±
(ω1, ω3) = (Ω0 + Ω1, Ω0 + ∆0 + Ω1 + ∆1) and (Ω0 −
kt2 >> 1 limit we see 8 peaks (Fig 2b). In addition to the previous four peaks cross peaks
appears at (ω1, ω3) = (Ω0 + ∆0, Ω0 −
∆0), (Ω0 −

Ω. Diagrams v and vi show the e to f peaks at ω1 ∼

Ω1 and and two overtone at

Ω1, Ω0 + ∆0 −

Ω1, Ω0 + ∆0 + Ω1 +

∆1) In the opposite

Ω1 −

Ω + ∆.

Note that the relation (Eq.(B5)), similar to Eq.(12) is valid for individual peaks in the

short time regime since peak shapes are not connected with any inhomogenity which carries

memory, however Eq.(12) does not apply for the whole 2D shape, since the memory of spin

state erases the cross peaks. In contrast, for long t2 (Fig 2b) this memory is lost and Eq.

(12) applies (excluding the overtone contributions).

In Fig 2c we plot SA (Eq.10) in the fast ku, kd >> Ω1 limit. We see a fundamental peak

at ω1 = ω3 = Ω0 and an overtone peak at ω1 = Ω1, ω3 = Ω0 + ∆0. Linear response in fast
regime shows one peak (ﬂuctuational narrowing17). Any memory of t1 interval is lost in the

t3 interval and the factorization (Eq.11) is valid resulting in Eq. 12 which is observed in Fig

2c.

V. TWO-STATE-JUMP WITH SPECTRAL DIFFUSION

Spectral diﬀusion is described by a dimensionless overdamped Brownian oscillator coordi-

nate Q (Eq.(1)) whose variance 1 and its dynamics is given by the Fokker-Planck operator27

∂
∂Q (cid:18)
where Λ is the relaxation rate. For fast ﬂuctuations Ω2/Λ << 1, spectral diﬀusion may

(20)

be accounted for by simply adding dephasing rates Ω2

2/Λ to the lineshapes. The complete

solution of the Fokker-Planck equation is required for arbitrary ﬂuctuation timescales.

We deﬁne ǫ(g)

For slow chemical exchange compared to the spectral diﬀusion (ku, kd << σ, Λ) the TSJ

peaks are well resolved and their lineshapes are determined by the spectral diﬀusion. Chem-

ical exchange occurs on a much longer timescale and aﬀects the cross peaks.

We start by setting Ω3, ∆3 = 0 and examine fast and the slow spectral diﬀusion. The fast

(motional narrowing) limit (Λ >> Ω2) gives a Lorentzian absorption lineshape. Since the

(25)

(26)

bath has no memory, peak shapes are less sensitive to t2 and cross peaks due to chemical

exchange only appear as t2 is increased. Eﬀects of fast ﬂuctuations may be accounted for

by adding dephasing rates Ω2

2/Λ. 2D-lineshapes SA (Eq. (10) shown in Fig 3 are similar

to the TSJ model (Fig 2), both are given by a product of Lorentzian lineshapes (in ω1, ω3).

is determined by both exchange and dephasing rates (kd + Ω2

The important diﬀerence is that when accounting for fast spectral diﬀusion, the linewidth
2/Λ)−1, i.e. it is diﬀerent from
the cross-peak timescale. In contrast the linewidth of TSJ model must be equal to exchange

rate k obtained by analysis of the cross-peaks growth.

SA in the static Λ << Ω2 limit (Fig 4) shows Gaussian linear lineshapes. Static disorder is

eliminated in the photon echo kI experiment. 2D peaks are elliptic with diﬀerent ”diagonal”

and ”oﬀ-diagonal” linewidths (Fig 4a)30. The intermediate regime may be observed at

Λ−1 < t2 < k−1 when the bath loses memory (Fig 4b) and the 2D peaks become symmetric.

For long times kdt2 >> 1 we see cross peaks induced by chemical exchange. Note the circular

contours of Fig 4c, compared to the star-like contours for fast ﬂuctuations (Fig 3). These

may be understood by noting that the product of two Gaussians (which represent the linear

lineshape for the slow case) is rotationally invariant, unlike the Lorentzian lineshapes in the

fast limit.

Fig 5 shows the kI and kII signals (Eqs. (8), and (9)) . The kI contribution dominates

at short times, and shows eﬀective rephasing (photon echo) and the ﬁnal 2DIR is similar to

this dominating kI contribution (See Fig 4a,). The bath loses memory of its initial state in

the third interval. For longer t2 >> Λ−1 (right panels), the kI and kII contributions become

comparable and SA becomes symmetric (see Fig 4).

We next explore some more general cases. First we take ∆2 6

= 0. The overtone peaks

may then show diﬀerent widths along ω3 and ω1. (overtone photon echoes are expected at

Ω2t1 = (Ω2 + ∆2)t3 ) Note that we have a slow bath (Λ < Ω2) for the eg and a fast bath for

the ef transition (Λ > Ω2 + ∆2). These lineshapes are shown in Fig. 6.

The inclusion of Ω3 does not require additional numerical eﬀort. This parameter allows

the u and d peaks have a diﬀerent width due the spectral diﬀusion.

To demonstrate these eﬀects and relate them to recent experiments1 we have simulated

the spectral diﬀusion using a single overdamped Brownian coordinate allowing a diﬀerent

width for u and d peaks. We used the splitting 2∆0 = 34cm−1 (i.e.
exchange rates ku = 0.1ps−1 kd = 0.125ps−1 which were determined in1 from the cross peaks

1.01ps−1) and the

∼

10

growth. Three regimes similar to those of Fig 4 were observed1 suggesting that the bath is

not fast. The intermediate regime, where the memory of the BO coordinate is lost (circular

lineshape) but the cross peaks are still weak, was found on the 2ps timescale. We thus

assumed for the relaxation rate Λ

0.4ps−1. Knowing Λ, Ω1 and Ω3 are connected to the

∼

peak linewidth in linear spectra and can be estimated using the Pade approximant of a

2-level system23,31. We have simulated the absorption spectra in Fig 7 and found lineshapes

similar to experiment for Ω2 = 0.33ps−1, Ω3 =

0.07ps−1. This completely determines the

−

model for 2D IR spectroscopy (neglecting dynamics in the overtone), we have no additional

free parameter. In Fig 18 we show that the predicted 2DIR lineshapes of the same model are

in qualitative agreement with experiment. We see all three regimes, rephasing eliptic shapes

, the relaxed Brownian oscillator with circular shape and chemical exchange cross-peaks at

the proper timescales. The peaks have also the correct relative intensity the lower frequency

peak is weaker but broader.

In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the SLE may be used to model chemical ex-

change in 2DIR spectroscopy. Spectral diﬀusion can no longer be accounted for in terms

of dephasing rates, when its timescale may be observed in experiment and its proper de-

scription must be combined with the two state jump which describe chemical exchange. The

high temperature overdamped Brownian oscillator model for spectral diﬀusion with arbitrary

ﬂuctuation timescale reproduces the most signiﬁcant features of recent experiments1.

In contrast with calculations based on cumulant expansions at ﬁnite temperatures16,23,32

our high temperature bath does not respond to the state of system, and its evolution in

the ground and excited state is same. This may limit the applicability of SLE model when

signatures of the vibrational Stokes shift are observed in 2DIR signals, however it simpliﬁes

the calculations. The lack of phase factors during the t2 interval reduces the dynamics to

classical level and allows large scaleMD simulations of environmental dynamics.

Reaction Paths Based on First-Passage Times

(Dated: June 27, 2013)

Finding reaction paths is a challenging yet important task for understanding reaction mechanisms
of diverse processes in nature. Various methods were employed in previous studies, but they were
not derived from an ensemble of all reaction events. We propose a new notion of reaction path that
is based on an ensemble of all reaction events. The basic idea is to employ mean ﬁrst-passage times
as reaction coordinates and construct reaction paths from them. We apply the idea to ﬁnd reaction
paths for continuous and discrete systems.

In many physical, chemical, or biological reactions, the
initial (reactant) and ﬁnal (product) states are known but
the pathways of the reaction are not. Examples range
in complexity from single-particle Brownian motion to
conformational changes of proteins, such as protein fold-
ing [1, 2]. Finding the pathways is important for under-
standing reaction mechanisms and is closely related to
the calculation of reaction rates [3]. In most cases of in-
terest, reactions take place at nonzero temperature and
therefore are stochastic; every reactive trajectory follows
a diﬀerent path and takes a diﬀerent amount of time.
(We use the term “trajectory” to mean a path parame-
terized by time.) There have been two kinds of studies:
(i) a multitude of reactive trajectories is sampled and an-
alyzed [4], (ii) optimal paths are constructed according to
certain criteria and considered to capture reaction mech-
anisms [5, 6]. This letter follows the latter approach.

The criteria for such optimal paths, termed “reaction
paths” hereafter, are twofold. First, reaction paths have
to be minimal, free of unnecessary ﬂuctuations. Second,
reaction paths have to be representative so that actual
reactive trajectories can be considered as noisy trajecto-
ries around them. It is, however, challenging to formulate
these criteria rigorously.

The most widely used formulation of reaction path is
probably the steepest-descent path, which is constructed
by following the steepest descent of an energy surface
from saddle points such that energy barriers along the
path are minimized [5]. The steepest-descent path, how-
ever, does not involve temperature. Since reactions are
driven by thermal ﬂuctuations, temperature should play
an important role in determining reaction paths. For
example, if there is a direct path with high energy bar-
riers and a roundabout path with low energy barriers,
at a temperature higher than the barriers reactions will
occur most likely along the direct path rather than the
roundabout path while the steepest-descent path will be
the roundabout path regardless of temperature. The
steepest-descent path is not a good formulation of reac-
tion path in such cases and a formulation with a notion
of temperature is required.

Understanding this drawback of the steepest-descent
path has led to alternative formulations of reaction path.
One approach is to assign each path x(l), parameter-

R

ized with arc length l and connecting the reactant and
dl eβU(x(l)) where β
product states, the cost function
is the inverse temperature and U (x) is the energy of
state x, and select the path that minimizes the cost func-
tion [7, 8]. This cost function was derived from the idea
that a reaction path should maximize stationary reac-
tive ﬂux, but it was assumed in the derivation that all
reactive trajectories were conﬁned along a single path.
Considering the stochastic nature of reactions, the valid-
ity of the assumption of one-dimensional dynamics is not
clear. Another formulation focuses on the most probable
path [9, 10]. In this approach, an ensemble of trajecto-
ries of a ﬁxed time interval is considered. A probability
is then assigned to each trajectory, and the path followed
by the most probable reactive trajectory is taken as the
reaction path. This amounts to minimizing an action in-
tegral, and similar methods were used to solve boundary-
value problems in classical mechanics [11, 12]. It is not
clear, however, how to choose the time interval before-
hand and whether an ensemble of trajectories of a single
time interval suﬃces to represent the reaction.

The above methods succeeded to a certain extent in
elucidating reaction mechanisms, but they were not de-
rived from an ensemble of all reactive trajectories. This
seems to be a shortcoming as reaction paths are sup-
posed to be representative. In this letter we present a
new formulation of reaction path that is based on an en-
semble of all reactive trajectories. While the previous ap-
proaches attempted to quantify paths through cost func-
tions or probabilities, we turn attention to the concept
of reaction coordinate which quantiﬁes states. A reac-
tion coordinate is a function that describes where in a
reaction process a state is located. Once a reaction co-
ordinate is determined, we choose as reaction paths the
paths along which the reaction coordinate decreases most
rapidly, which complies with the criterion that reaction
paths have to be minimal. We here employ as a reaction
coordinate of a state the mean ﬁrst-passage time (MFPT)
from the state to the given product. The MFPT, the av-
erage amount of time that a trajectory starting from the
state takes to reach the product, is a natural measure
of the progress in the reaction; it depends on the energy
proﬁle, the temperature, and the boundary conditions,
and it is an average over all reactive trajectories.

A continuous system. Dashed lines are contours of the reac-
tion coordinate (the MFPT to the product). In a Cartesian
coordinate system, they are orthogonal to the reaction paths.
(b) A discrete system. Dots are the accessible states.

We now describe the scheme of determining reaction
coordinates and reaction paths, as illustrated in Fig. 1.
Consider a system undergoing a stochastic reaction and
let S be the set of all states that the system can take.
If S is continuous the reaction can be described by a
Fokker-Planck-type equation, and if S is discrete it can
be described by a master equation [13]. The reactant
and the product are speciﬁed by disjoint subsets, R and
P respectively, of S. The reaction can be considered a
ﬁrst-passage process [14] because a reactive trajectory
ends as soon as it reaches any state in P. The MFPT
τ (x) from state x to P is then calculated for all states in S
(this involves solving a inhomogeneous partial diﬀerential
equation when S is continuous and inverting a transition
matrix when discrete, as demonstrated later) and is used
as a reaction coordinate. The reaction coordinate τ (x)
does not depend on the location of the reactant R, which
is involved only in determining reaction paths.

Although using MFPTs as reaction coordinates is a
general idea that can be applied as long as MFPTs are
well deﬁned, the scheme of constructing reaction paths
depends on the character of the set S. When S is con-
tinuous and described by a Cartesian coordinate system,
reaction paths are constructed following the direction of
−∇τ , along which τ decreases most rapidly. Thus, a re-
action path x(l), parameterized through an arc length l,
satisﬁes

Often, reactions are better described with non-Cartesian
coordinates such as angles. In such cases reaction paths
can be determined via a transformation to a Cartesian
coordinate system, and the resulting equation of reaction

When S is discrete and the reaction is governed by a
master equation with transition rates kyx (from state x
to state y), the MFPT τx from state x to the product P
is again employed as a reaction coordinate. But in order
to determine reaction paths an analogue of the metric is
required, as reaction paths in the continuous cases are
determined via gradients which involve the metric. The
only possible candidate is the transition rates kyx them-
selves, and we suggest the scheme that a reaction path
going through state x chooses the next state y such that
kyx(τx − τy) is maximized. For the transition step from
x to y, the transition time 1/kyx may be interpreted as
a cost, and the decrease τx −τy in the MFPT as a gain.
The scheme then amounts to maximizing the ratio be-
tween these two times.

According to the above scheme, a reaction path is con-
structed starting from each state in the reactant set R.
In general, multiple reaction paths are obtained unless
the reactant is narrowed down to a single state. (Some
reaction paths may overlap if they go through a com-
mon state.) If all constructed reaction paths lie close to
one another, the reaction can be understood in terms of a
single pathway, which is the case presumed in many stud-
ies of reaction paths. It may happen, however, that the
constructed reaction paths diverge from one another sig-
niﬁcantly, spanning almost the whole part of S. In such
cases the idea of a single pathway has to be abandoned.
To demonstrate the above scheme and its outcomes, we
consider ﬁrst a Brownian motion on a two-dimensional
potential surface described with a Cartesian coordinate
system (x1, x2). We take the three-hole potential

that was also studied by others regarding the tempera-
ture dependence of reaction paths [8, 10]. The potential
features two deep holes and one shallow hole (Fig. 2).

The two deep holes are considered as the reactant and
the product. Roughly two possible pathways can be seen;
the upper path is longer than the lower one but has lower
energy barriers. It is therefore expected that the upper
path will be taken at low temperatures and that the lower
path will be taken at high temperatures.

The Brownian motion can be described in terms of
the probability distribution p(x, t) and the probability
current J(x, t). In the strong friction regime, they satisfy
the Smoluchowski equation [13]

where γ is the friction coeﬃcient. The MFPT τ (x) is
then obtained by solving the partial diﬀerential equation

with appropriate boundary conditions [15]. We take the
region (−4 ≤ x1 ≤ 4, −3 ≤ x2 ≤ 4) as the whole set S,
and assume that its boundary is reﬂecting, namely the
probability current J is tangential to the boundary. For
the reactant R we take the single point (−1, 0), and for
the product P we take the circular region of radius 0.1
centered at (1, 0). The boundary of P is absorbing, with
the probability distribution p vanishing at the boundary.
These boundary conditions for p and J lead to corre-
sponding boundary conditions for τ : τ vanishes at the
absorbing boundary and ∇τ is tangential to the reﬂect-
ing boundary [15].

The solutions, obtained numerically with MAT-
LAB [16], for two diﬀerent temperatures are shown in
Fig. 3. The diﬀerences between the two temperatures
are dramatic. At the high temperature (β = 1) the ar-
rows ﬂow more or less directly towards the product. At
the low temperature (β = 8), on the other hand, the
ﬂow is signiﬁcantly distorted so that energy barriers are
avoided; the reaction coordinate τ drops rapidly when
barriers are crossed as indicated by the contours closely
packed around saddle points, and a singular point is visi-
ble around (−1.5, −0.5). Fig. 4 shows the reaction paths
found at various temperatures. As was expected, lower
paths are taken at high temperatures and upper paths
are taken at low temperatures. At intermediate temper-
atures, such as β = 4, reaction paths lie in between, which
indicates that the upper and lower paths are equally fa-
vorable at these temperatures.

Light-harvesting complexes make good cases that can
be studied by the scheme of determining reaction paths
for discrete systems. We take the chlorophyll aggregate
of photosystem I of cyanobacterium Synechococcus elon-
gatus as an example. Photosystem I is a protein-pigment
complex, embedded in the cell membrane, that contains
96 chlorophylls. The network of these chlorophylls is re-
sponsible for the ﬁrst step in photosynthesis, namely the

absorption of light and the subsequent migration of the
resulting electronic excitation towards P700, where the
next step in photosynthesis, the charge separation, oc-
curs. This excitation migration can be considered a re-
action. The reactant is the state where the excitation
is at a chlorophyll that is initially hit by a photon, and
the product is the state where excitation is at either of
the P700 pair of chlorophylls. Reaction paths then pro-
vide representative and minimal pathways of excitation
migration in the network of chlorophylls from the initial
chlorophylls to the P700 pair.

This diﬃculty is due to the fact that a reaction coordinate
must be determined on the entire region of S, which re-
ﬂects nothing but the nature of reaction-path problems.
Possibilities of approximate solutions, however, are not
ruled out. One possibility is to break S into a man-
ageable number of discrete macrostates and model the
reaction with transitions among these macrostates. The
transition rates can be obtained, for example, from the
free energies of the macrostates based on the principle
of detailed balance. The scheme of constructing reaction
paths for discrete systems can then be invoked.

Since we are interested in ﬁrst passages of excitation
it is convenient to consider a subsystem of
to P700,
94 chlorophylls, excluding the P700 pair of chlorophylls.
The migration of excitation in this subsystem can be de-
scribed by a master equation

where px(t) is the probability that the excitation resides
at chlorophyll x at time t and Kxy is a 94×94 transition
matrix. We build the transition matrix Kxy by using the
inter-chlorophyll excitation-transfer rates that were cal-
culated in Ref. [17] based on the recently obtained struc-
ture of photosystem I [18]. The MFPT τx from chloro-
phyll x to the P700 pair is then given as [19, 20]

Here K −1
xy is the inverse matrix of Kxy and ξx is the
rate of exit to P700 at chlorophyll x. Reaction paths are
then constructed from the MFPT. The resulting reaction
paths are shown in Fig. 5. A detailed discussion of this
system will be reported in a forthcoming paper [20].

In this letter we have derived a new formulation of re-
action path based on an ensemble of all reactive trajec-
tories. MFPTs are employed as reaction coordinates and
reaction paths are constructed from them. As illustrated
in Figs. 3 and 5, MFPTs give complete pictures of re-
actions which individual reaction paths do not provide.
The present approach also suggests a new perspective
on the relationship between reaction paths and reaction
rates. Reaction paths are usually considered as a starting
point to calculations of rates, but in our picture correct
reaction paths are obtained only after the calculations of
reaction rates which are the inverses of the MFPTs from
the reactant to the product.

A drawback of the present method is that it is too
costly to be directly applied to high-dimensional contin-
uous systems such as conformational changes of proteins.

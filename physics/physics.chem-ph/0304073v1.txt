Abstract

The density of states and other thermodynamic functions of helium nanodroplets are calcu-

lated for a microcanonical ensemble with both energy and total angular momentum treated as

conserved quantum numbers. These functions allow angular momentum conserving evaporative

cooling simulations. As part of this project, a recursion relationship is derived for the reduction

to irreducible representations of the n’th symmetric power of the irreducible representations of the

rotation group. These give the distribution of total angular momentum states generated by putting

multiple quanta into a ripplon or phonon mode of the droplet, each of which is characterized by a

angular momentum quantum number.

INTRODUCTION

Spectroscopy of atoms and molecules dissolved in superﬂuid helium nanodroplets has

become a ﬁeld of intense activity. Such nanodroplets rapidly cool by evaporation, reaching

ﬁnal temperatures of

0.37 K [1]. There is a long history of their formation and study by

≈

mass spectroscopic methods [2, 3]. Vibrational [1, 4, 5], electronic [6, 7, 8], and rotational [9,

10, 11] transitions have been observed. Part of the interest in this ﬁeld is that helium droplets

provide a nearly ideal matrix [12] for isolation of highly unstable compounds. Many novel

compounds and clusters have been synthesized and spectroscopically studied in this unique

environment [13, 14, 15, 16, 17].

There have been several previously reported calculations of the evaporative cooling of

helium nanodroplets [18, 19], and these have predicted a terminal temperature in excellent

agreement with that later observed experimentally [1]. These calculations, however, have

not considered angular momentum conservation, which obviously imposes constraints on

droplet cooling in a high vacuum environment.

In order to address the question of the

possible trapping of angular momentum in a cooling droplet, we have undertaken a new

study of the evaporative cooling of the nanodroplets, but including angular momentum con-

servation, using methods analogous to “Phase Space Theory” calculations of unimolecular

dissociation [20]. Necessary inputs to such calculations are the density of states and inte-

grated density of states of helium nanodroplets, over the energy and angular momentum

range sampled in the evaporative cooling trajectories of nanodroplets.

The angular momentum resolved density of states of helium nanodroplets is not available

in the literature. While the calculation of this quantity is largely based upon straightforward

extensions of standard convolution methods, there is one particular point that was not. The

distribution of angular momentum states produced by excitation of an arbitrary number of

quanta in a (2L + 1) degenerate vibrational state of angular momentum quantum number L

was required. This distribution is provided by the reduction of the n’th symmetric product

of the L’th irreducible representation of the group of transformations of a sphere, K. While

the equivalent reduction for common molecular point groups is well known [21], the present

author could not locate the general result for K, and has derived a recursion relationship

that provides the needed reduction. This is presented in the present paper, along with a

derived asymptotic expression, which is of the same form as the thermal distribution of a

2

rigid spherical top.

The density of both ripplon and phonon modes are considered separately. In each case,

the simple scaling of the excitation spectrum with droplet size (and thus number of helium

atoms), allows the density of states to be derived as a unique function of a reduced energy.

These functions have been ﬁt to simple analytical expressions which provide excellent ap-

proximations over the range of energy and angular momentum of interest. In particular, it

is found that the distribution of angular momentum quantum states is of the form of the

thermal distribution of rotation for a rigid spherical top, with a reduced energy dependent

eﬀective inverse “temperature” that changes slowly with energy.

RIPPLON EXCITATIONS

The lowest energy excitations of a pure droplet are ripplons, which are quantized capillary

waves on the surface of the droplets. The properties of such waves on spherical drops are

thoroughly described in the classic text on hydrodynamics by Lamb [22]. Classically, each

ripplon mode involves a modulation of the surface of the droplet, with

with N equal to the number of helium atoms in the droplet. Given that the spectrum of

3N

ripplon modes is proportional to a common factor that contains the size dependence, the

thermodynamic functions of the ripplon modes are universal functions of a reduced energy
which has unit value equal to Er = ¯hω0 = 3.77/√N kBK.

The integrated total state count, NE, and the total density of states, ρE, can be calcu-

lated from the spectrum of ripplon mode frequencies using the Beyer-Swinehart direct count

method [20].

In addition to the spectrum, one needs the degeneracy of a state with nL

3

quanta in the ripplon mode with quantum number L. This is equal to the number of distinct
ways of putting nL identical objects into 2L + 1 bins and is equal to g(nL, L) = (nL+2L)!
(2L)!nL!

[23].

Deﬁne NE(E, L) to be the integrated density of states calculated using only ripplon modes

with angular momentum quantum numbers less than or equal to L. We can recursively

calculate the total integrated density of states by using:

where the unit step function is deﬁned by Φ(x) = 1(0) for x greater or equal to (or less than)

zero. In the Beyer-Swinehart algorithm, the above are calculated using an energy bin size,

δE suﬃciently small that each ωL/δE can be approximated by an integer. A step size of 0.1

reduced energy unit was used in this work. The calculated values of NE and ρE are plotted

on ﬁgure 1. We have ﬁtted the calculated integrated density of states to the expression

NE = exp

Values of a = 2.5118 and b= -3.4098 minimized the root mean squared fractional errors

over the interval E = 50

2500. Changing the step size in the calculation and reﬁtting

the integrated density of states gave values of a = 2.5118 and b = -3.4110. The leading

power of 4/7 can be derived by equating the high temperature limit of the microcanonical

and canonical ensemble values of energy and entropy (which is proportional to ln(ρE) in the

microcanonical case). The power of 1/7 for the correction term was selected based upon the

slope, on a log-log plot, of NEE−4/7 vs. E. The expression for NE given in Eq. 6 agrees with

the Beyer-Swinehart direct count to within

5% while NE increases by more than 83 order

of magnitude over the reduced energy range 50

2500. Using standard expressions [24] for

the thermodynamic functions of a microcanonical ensemble, we can derive the following:

SE, TE, and CV are the microcannonical values of the entropy, temperature, and heat capac-

ity due to the droplet modes as a function of reduced rippon energy. The density of states,

ρE, can be compared with 0.311E−5/7 exp(2.49E4/7) derived by Brink and Stringari [18]

through inverse Laplace Transformation of the high temperature canonical partition func-

tion using the stationary phase approximation. (Their reported results have been converted

to the normalized roton energy units used in this work). It can be seen that the exponential

dependence of the density of states is almost identical, but there is a slight diﬀerence in the

power of the energy dependence of the exponential prefactor.

For isolated helium nanodroplets, angular momentum as well as energy is a conserved

quantity, and thus the proper statistical ensemble is one that sums only over states of the

same energy and total angular momentum. As a ﬁrst step in the calculation of the properties

of this ensemble, we have derived a regression expression that determines NJ (J, nL, L) which

is the number of states of total angular momentum quantum number J that are generated

from placing nL quanta in a ripplon mode with angular momentum L. We “count” such that

each “state” is an irreducible representation with 2J + 1 values of the projection quantum

number. This recursion expression and its derivation is given in the Appendix to this paper.

The individual values of NJ (J, nL, L) are quite irregular and do not appear to derive from

any simple expression. However, the sum of states, of course, gives the simple expression:

(2J + 1)NJ (J, nL, L) = g(nL, L) =

(n + 2L)!
(2L)!nL!

Also, the mean value of the squared angular momentum has been empirically found to be

given by a simple expression:

If we ignored the Bose symmetry (i.e. treated the angular momenta of diﬀerent quanta in

the same Ripplon mode as uncorrelated), we would not have the last term on the right hand

side. The Bose symmetry increases the mean squared angular momentum because ripplon

excitations have a greater probability of being in the same direction than if they where

If we neglect the correlations induced by the Bose symmetry of the ripplon modes, we get

the same result as above but with the last term on the right hand side omitted.

In a previous paper,the present author used the uncorrelated expression to calculate the

root mean squared averaged angular ripplon angular momentum as a function of droplet
size [25]. Figure 2 shows a plot of the thermally averaged value of J2 calculated both ne-

glecting the Bose symmetry and by explicit thermal average over the present Microcanonical

results. It is seen that the exact calculation is modestly higher than for the uncorrelated

prediction, but by a nearly constant factor of approximately 20%.

Given NJ (J, nL, L), the J restricted state count and density of states can be computed

using a modiﬁcation of the Beyer-Swinehart direct count. Deﬁne NEJ (E, J, L) to the in-

tegrated density of states with total angular momentum J, but including excitation only

in ripplon modes up to angular momentum quantum number L. The following recursion

relation is easily derived by using the triangle rule:

for each E, we need to iterate on L until ¯hωL > E to get the complete integrated density of

states, NEJ(E, J), with total angular momentum J. We have explicitly calculated NEJ (E)

for E

It was found that for each E > 50, NEJ(E, J) has a

Using the relationship given in Eq. 12, we have derived a recursion relationship to calculate

this quantity without having to explicitly enumerate all the states as a function of J. Let

A(E) be the average of the total angular momentum quantum numbers for all states up to

reduced energy E, and A(E, L) the same quantity, but calculated only using ripplon modes

with quantum numbers up to L. Since angular momentum in diﬀerent modes are uncorre-

lated, the total angular momentum is just the sum of angular momentum in each individual

mode. It is straightforward to derive that

The inverse “rotational temperature”, βL(E), can be calculated by using the standard spher-

ical top relation A(E) = 3/(2βL(E)). Using this procedure, βL(E) has been calculated for

E = 10

2500.. The values of βL(E) are plotted in ﬁgure 4 along with a ﬁt through the

points to a power law in energy:

βL(E) = cE−8/7 + dE−13/7

(18)

with c = 0.8680 and d = 0.9639. A ﬁt the the values calculated using an energy bin of 0.01

reduced units gave c = 0.8679 and 0.9759. The βL values from this ﬁt are also displayed on

ﬁgure 4, but cannot be distinguished on the scale of the plot. The βL(E) calculated with

Eq. 18 agrees with the calculated values to within 0.1% for E = 100

2500 and to within

−

1% for E = 50

100. The reduction in accuracy in this domain is because the calculated

−

values of βL(E) oscillate around the value predicted by Eq. 18. The leading power of -8/7

in βL(E) can be derived by equating the high temperature limit for the mean value of the

total angular momentum squared for the canonical and microcanonical ensemble.

Using the standard relationships, we can use calculate the thermodynamic quantities as

a function of reduced ripplon energy and total angular momentum of the droplet as:

PHONON EXCITATIONS

Starting at higher energy than the surface ripplon modes are phonon (compressional)

excitations of the helium droplets. These normal modes are characterized by two quantum

numbers, n, L, where n = 1, 2, . . . is the number of radial nodes and L is the angular

momentum quantum number. Each normal node can be characterized by a wavenumber

kn,L which is determined by kn,L = rn,L/R where rn,L is the n’th root of the spherical bessel
1 ˚A−1 (i.e. much smaller than the wavenumber of a roton), the
function jL [26]. For kn,L ≪
excitation angular frequency of each mode is given by ωn,L = ukn,L, where u = 236 m/s is the

speed of sound in helium [26]. We deﬁne a reduced energy Ep with an energy unit equal to
534N −1/3 GHz

the excitation energy of the lowest (n = 1, L = 0) phonon which is ¯huπ/R = h

·

= 25.5N −1/3 K kB.

We have calculated the density of states using similar methods as for the ripplon density

of states. The integrated density of states was ﬁt to the functional form

values of NE to an accuracy of better than

0.09% while NE varies by more than 130 orders

of magnitude over the reduced energy interval Ep = 25

500.

We have assumed that the distribution of total angular momentum states will again be

well approximated by the spherical top thermal distribution expression 16. Values of βL(E)

have been calculated using the recursion relationship for A(E), Eq. 17. These were found

to be well approximated by the expression

βL(E) = cE−5/4 + dE−7/4

(24)

Values of c = 0.2545 and d = 0.2929 reproduce the calculated values of βL(E) to a fractional

accuracy of better than 0.2% over the reduced energy interval Ep = 25

500. Given these

−

expressions for NE(E) and βL(E), expressions for the various microcanonical thermodynamic

quantities can be derived, both with and without angular momentum constraints, analogous

the expressions given above for the ensemble of ripplon modes.

The same procedure can be used to calculate the density of states without the restriction
1 ˚A, if the values of νn,m are calculated using the elementary excitation energy of

kn,L ≪
liquid helium for wavenumber kn,L. However, this no longer results in a density of states

that is a function only of a reduced energy, Ep, and thus would have to explicitly calculated

for each droplet size. This has not been pursued in the present work.

CONCLUSIONS

In this work, we have presented simple numerical procedures that allows the calculation

of the density of states of both ripplon and phonon excitations of a helium nanodroplet as

a function of both reduced energy and total angular momentum quantum numbers. It is

found that these can well approximated by simple analytical expressions. It has been found

that the distribution of rotational total angular momentum, for each energy, closely follows

that of rigid spherical top. The microcanonical expressions for the ripplon density of states

has been used by the author and collaborator for statistical evaporative cooling calculations

of both pure and doped helium nanodroplets, conserving angular momentum. That work

will be presented in a future publication.

APPENDIX: REDUCTION OF SYMMETRIC PRODUCTS OF THE ROTATION

GROUP

In order to compute the density of ripplon states as a function of both energy and total

angular momentum quantum number, one needs to determine the distribution of states

of diﬀerent angular momentum generated by nL quanta in each ripplon mode with mode

angular momentum quantum number L. We use the fact that a set of states with total

angular moment quantum number L and with projection M =

L,

L + 1 . . . L is an

−

−

irreducible representation of the rotation group of the sphere, K (or the double group of

rotations is half integer angular momentum is allowed for). Below, when we speak of a

“state” with a given total angular momentum quantum number, J, it will be implicit we

mean a degenerate set of (2J + 1) eigenstates with the allowed range of projection quantum

numbers. For the states generated by multiple excitations in diﬀerent modes, the total

angular momentum distribution is found by reduction of the direct product representation

of the distributions in each mode. The reduction of a direct product representation for the

sphere gives the well known triangle rule, i.e. products of states with quantum numbers J1
J2|
can be applied recursively to determine the total number of states with each total J once

and J2 give one state each with J =

+ 1, . . . , J1 + J2. The triangle rule

,

we know the distribution of number of states with each J quantum number for excitation

of nL quanta in a harmonic ripplon mode with angular momentum quantum number L.

The distribution of states produced by multiple excitation in a degenerate mode is not

give by the direct product of that mode with itself nL times, but by the states given from

the reduction of the symmetric nL power product of that mode. This is the meaning of the

widely cited statement that vibrational quanta are “Bosons”. For the point groups relevant

to the spectra of rigid molecules, the reduction of such symmetric products can be found in

a standard text on vibrational spectroscopy [21]. However, the author has not been able to

10

locate equivalent expressions for the reduction of general symmetric powers of the rotation

group. In this appendix, we give a recursion relation that has been used to calculate these

up to high values of L and nL.

Each state produced by the symmetric direct product of nL quanta in mode with total

angular momentum quantum number L can be represented by a set of mi quantum numbers
(integer or half integer depending upon L) such that

as is done in many introductory Quantum texts when calculating the terms produced by

a given atomic conﬁguration.

It is apparent, since all terms in Eq. A.26 shift in their

ﬁrst argument by one when the ﬁrst argument on the left shifted by one that exactly the

same recursion relationship can be applied to directly calculate the NJ (J, nL, L) values.

However, in such a calculation, one must replaces NJ (

J, nL, L) by

NJ (J

the recursion is started by using NJ (J, 1, L) = δ(J, L). It is also easily demonstrated that

NJ (J, 2, L) = (1/2)

for J

2L (the factor of 2L is included to make the

result correct even in the case of half integer quantum numbers). Note that it is possible

to calculate each successive value of nL by replacement in a single stored two dimensional

matrix by looping down from the highest L value.

The calculation of the NJ (J, nL, L) values becomes quite memory demanding for large

values of nL, L. This is in part because they must be generated with increasing values of nL,

requiring a three dimensional matrix with

but must be used in the calculation of the density of states in order of increasing L, thus
2(nmaxLmax)2 elements, where nmax and
≈
Lmax are the highest values of nL and L needed. However, it has been found that for large

nL and L values the distribution of NJ (J, nL, L) approaches that of a rotational distribution

of a spherical top, i.e.

is the total number of states (including the 2J+1 degeneracies)

generated with J = 0 . . . nLL. This functional form can be justiﬁed when it is recognized

that the central limit theorem [23] suggests that NM (M, nL, L) should approach a Gaussian

distribution in M for large nL values and that NJ (J, nL, L) is the derivative of NM (J, nL, L)

in that limit. We can determine the dependence of β(nL, L) by equating the “thermal

average” value of J(J + 1) to the exact expression, Eq. 12, which gives

β(nL, L) =

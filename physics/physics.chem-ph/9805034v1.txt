Abstract

We present the ﬁrst experimental characterization in molecular
fragile glassformers of a ”prepeak” that appears signiﬁcantly below the
main peak of the static structure factor. The temperature and density
dependences of this prepeak are studied via elastic neutron scattering
experiments under high pressure (up to 300 MPa) in m-toluidine and
m-ﬂuoroaniline. The prepeak intensity increases with decreasing tem-
perature, but it remains constant with increasing pressure while its
position and width stay roughly the same. These features are oppo-
site to those observed for the ”ﬁrst sharp diﬀraction peak” of network
glasses. The origin of the phenomenon is analyzed with the help of
Monte Carlo simulations. We associate the prepeak with hydrogen-
bond-induced heterogeneities (or clusters) whose limited size results
from an exclusion eﬀect between benzene rings that prevents the ex-
tension of a hydrogen-bond network. Implications for the dynamics
of the liquid close to the glass transition are ﬁnally considered.

Analyzing the structure of glasses and supercooled liquids can give some
insight into the mechanisms involved in the glass transition at a micro-or
mesoscopic scale. Recently there has been growing experimental evidence of
the existence of heterogeneities that develop with decreasing temperature in
fragile supercooled liquids [1]. Such heterogeneities are at the basis of many
theories [2] of the dramatic slowing down of the relaxations when approach-
ing the glass transition. Heterogeneities of some sort have also been invoked
to explain the apparently anomalous relaxational properties of monohydric
alcohols and supercooled water : these latter would be due to a cluster-
ing phenomenon involving hydrogen-bonding interactions [3]. However, the
evidence for heterogeneities, domains or clusters is mostly indirect, i.e. ex-
tracted from dynamical measurements. It would thus be of major interest to
ﬁnd the signature of such entities directly in structural data.

Network-forming glasses and melts show a ﬁrst sharp diﬀraction peak
(FSDP) in X-ray and neutron diﬀraction data which, although still debated,
seems convincingly attributed to some intermediate-range order [4]. As for
molecular systems, few results about the structure of their supercooled liquid
and glassy states have been reported, and the typical neutron or X-ray pat-
tern consists of broad peaks that evolve continuously with temperature and
display no drastic changes at the glass temperature Tg. A recent low-angle
neutron diﬀraction study has concluded to the absence of heterogeneities in
deuterated propylene glycol [5].

In this letter we present the ﬁrst experimental characterization for molec-
ular fragile glassformers of the temperature and density dependence of a
”prepeak” which appears at a wave vector Qpp ≈0.5 ˚A−1, i.e., signiﬁcantly
below the main peak of the static structure factor S(Q). We focus on a
series of substituted aromatic liquids, toluene (TOL), m-toluidine (MTOL)
and m-ﬂuoroaniline (MFA). An interesting property of these liquids is that
crystallization can be readily avoided so that they are good candidates for
a thorough study of the metastable liquid state. Despite the diﬀerences
in their dipole moment and intermolecular H-bonds strength, these liquids
present the same thermodynamic signature at Tg and are considered as some
of the most fragile systems [6].

The experiments were carried out on the 7C2 and G6.1 spectrometers at
the reactor Orph´ee of the laboratoire L´eon Brillouin1 (Saclay, France) at three
diﬀerent incident wave lengths in order to cover a large Q-range from 0.1 to
10 ˚A−1. An isotopic purity of the samples of more than 99% was obtained
by catalytic H-D exchange for the fully deuterated MTOL (C6D4CD3ND2),
the partially deuterated MTOL (C6D4CD3NH2), and MFA (C6HD3FND2).

The temperature range was from 320 K to 77 K, from well above the melting
temperature Tm down to well below Tg , and the pressure range was from
normal pressure up to 300 MPa. The pressure was measured out of the
cell and in the sample at the bottom of the cell, thus allowing to check
that the system is hydrostatically compressed. Spectra were corrected for
detector eﬃciencies, background, cell contribution and multiple scattering
using standard procedures. After normalization, Placzek corrections were
evaluated with a polynomial function. Other details on the experimental
setup and data reduction will be given in a forthcoming publication [7].

Fully corrected static structure factors S(Q) are presented in ﬁgs. 1 and 2
for MFA and partially deuterated MTOL, respectively. Like many aromatic
liquids, a main diﬀraction peak is observed in the Q-range between 1.3 ˚A−1
and 2.0 ˚A−1 and present diﬀerences in shape that are mainly due to diﬀerent
chemical constitution and cancellation eﬀects in the linear combination of
the partial structure factors.

The most noticeable feature in the S(Q) is a ”prepeak” that appears
at a much lower Q than the main peak for MFA and MTOL (ﬁgs. 1 and
2). Its intensity increases when T decreases down to Tg, at which point it
stays roughly constant (cf.
for instance the inset in ﬁg. 2). As illustrated
in ﬁg. 2, the position and the width of the prepeak remain constant to a
good approximation, whereas the main peak shifts slightly to higher Q due
to the increase in density. By using the pressure as an additional external
parameter, one can disentangle the eﬀects of density and temperature. We
have thus measured the isothermal and isochoric evolutions of the S(Q) of
MFA. The results for the T =285 K isotherm (liquid state) are displayed in
the inset of ﬁg. 1. For a density increase of about 10%, the main peak moves
to higher Q, as expected, whereas the prepeak appears remarkably constant
in position, width, and intensity. The same features are also observed for
the T =150 K isotherm in the glassy state. A quite diﬀerent behavior is
obtained in the evolution of S(Q) with temperature at a constant density of
1.3 gr/cm3 : as shown in ﬁg. 1, the main peak remains roughly constant,
which indicates no signiﬁcant modiﬁcation of the short-range order and local
molecular packing, but the intensity of the prepeak increases by a factor of
two when the temperature is decreased by 90 K. The fact that the prepeak
in MFA and MTOL seems to be only temperature dependent, together with
the absence of prepeak in the S(Q) of liquid and glassy TOL at 73 K [7],
suggests that the prepeak is a consequence of hydrogen bonding interactions.
”Prepeaks” (or FSDP) are commonly observed in the S(Q)’s of network
glasses and are usually interpreted as the signature of a structure in real space
that has a typical length greater than the ﬁrst shell of neighbors [4]. Recent
computer simulation studies support the idea that such an ”intermediate-

3

range order” originates from angular constraints in the topology of the ran-
dom network formed by tetrahedrally coordinated atoms [8]. Despite the
apparent similarity in the diﬀraction pattern, this explanation cannot be
transposed to MFA and MTOL. As already stressed, these latter liquids are
fragile. The H-bonding interactions are not dominant enough in their case
to generate a continuous network nor to change the extreme fragility that is
typical of the whole series of substituted aromatic liquids (as a fragility in-
dicator, note that the parameter D of the Vogel-Tammann-Fulcher equation
is between 3 and 6). Quite the contrary, network-forming systems are strong
(e.g., SiO2) or intermediate (e.g. ZnCl2) glassformers. Several characteristic
features of the prepeak are also very diﬀerent in network glasses and in the
present case.
In MFA and MTOL the position of the prepeak is at lower
Q than it is in the network systems (Qpp=0.5 ˚A−1 compared to 1-2 ˚A−1).
The pressure dependences, as well as the temperature dependences, are also
at variance since unlike in the vitreous SiO2 [9] the prepeaks in MFA and
MTOL are mainly dominated by temperature and not by density changes.
Moreover, while the main peak is sensitive to density changes and shifts to
higher Q by compressing or cooling, the prepeak position and its full width
at half maximum are constant over a wide temperature and density range,
from the stable liquid down to the glassy state. The inset of ﬁg. 2 shows
that the temperature dependence of the prepeak intensity in the supercooled
liquid is more pronounced than the normal Debye-Waller dependence shown
in the glassy state, and this is independent of the thermal treatment. Simi-
lar conclusions have been drawn from previous X-ray experiments at normal
pressure [10].

Due to the low value of Qpp (one third of that of the main peak) and to
the peculiar T and P dependences, the existence of the prepeak indicates a
spatial organization of the molecules that goes beyond the usual short-range
liquid order. However, its origin cannot be explained by pseudo-crystalline
models [11] for several reasons. Firstly, the prepeak appears in a reversible
way at temperatures above the melting point and persists in the stable liquid
state. Secondly, for some systems a Bragg peak can be found at 0.5 ˚A−1 in
the S(Q) of the crystal but no prepeak is observed in the S(Q) of the glassy
state as it was found for TOL [7].

In disordered systems, one often argues that the position of a peak reﬂects
some repetitive characteristic distance between structural units and that its
width corresponds to a correlation length [12, 13].
In order to check the
possibility of an increasing structural correlation length in the liquid, the
S(Q)’s of partially deuterated MTOL obtained at diﬀerent temperatures and
normal pressure have been normalized at the prepeak position (cf. ﬁg. 2).
It clearly appears that the half-width at half-maximum is independent of

4

temperature ; it yields a typical length of 50 ˚A, but no increase is detected
from above the melting temperature down to below Tg, i.e., over more than
200 K.

We suggest an explanation for the origin of the prepeak that involves the
existence of H-bond-induced heterogeneities or clusters with no signiﬁcant
growth of the typical length.
In order to gain more insight, we have also
carried out Monte-Carlo simulations of MTOL by using an eﬀective OPLS
potential developed by Jorgensen [14]. Monte-Carlo simulations have been
performed in the isothermal-isobaric ensemble (N, P, T ) at diﬀerent temper-
atures and pressures with a Metropolis sampling. The system consists of 768
molecules (more than 104 sites) in a cubic cell ca 50 ˚A on a side with periodic
boundary conditions. Full details on the simulations will be provided in a
forthcoming publication. After an equilibration period covering 106 to 3.106
conﬁgurations, the structural properties were averaged over the next 2.106
to 4.106 conﬁgurations. The total and some partial S(Q)’s and radial distri-
bution functions (RDF) at atmospheric pressure and room temperature are
presented in ﬁgs. 3a and 3b. We have checked that the agreement between
experiment and simulation is very good for the total S(Q) [7]. The numerical
simulations reveal the existence of a short-to-medium range order that shows
up in the partial structure factors associated with the NH2 group, SNN(Q) or
SNH(Q): the peak in SNN(Q) or SNH(Q) has a position at 0.5 ˚A−1, which cor-
responds to that of the prepeak in the total S(Q); its behavior is the same as
that observed in the experiments described above when temperature or den-
sity is independently changed [7], while an isothermal compression tends to
bring the peripheric groups (C, H, CH3) closer and aﬀects weakly the struc-
ture factor of the centers of the molecules, SCC(Q) [15]. When one replaces
the NH2 and CH3 groups by H atoms in the conﬁgurations of ﬁg. 3a, the
structure of benzene is restored [16]: the packing of the benzene rings is the
dominant eﬀect at Q’s above 1.0 ˚A−1 and H-bonding eﬀect is only illustrated
at lower Q’s. The two contributions are well separated in the particular case
of MTOL and MFA giving rise to a prepeak in the total structure factor.
Studying the center of the molecule and the aminogroup RDF’s provides two
levels of structural organization as presented in ﬁg. 3b. The former RDF
presents damped oscillations with a period of 5-6 ˚A, about one molecular
diameter, and is very similar to what is observed in simple Van der Waals
liquids [15]. In the latter appear ﬁrst the distance N-N of 3 ˚A, which is typical
of the H-bond itself, and an oscillation at 12 ˚A (and seemingly at 25 ˚A too).
This oscillation occurs with a typical period, which is the mean intercluster
separation or the mean cluster diameter. By Fourier transform, this typical
period gives rise in Q-space to the prepeak at 0.5 ˚A−1. On the basis of ge-
ometric criteria for the H-bond, we have checked the number of molecules

5

connected by H-bonds in a cluster. We have found a size distribution of
these clusters between 2 to 10 molecules, whose averaged number increases
when the temperature decreases while the largest size stays at 10 molecules.
The steric exclusion between aromatic rings prevents the extension of a con-
tinuous H-bond network contrary to what occurs in intermediate H-bonded
liquids such as small alcohol molecules [5, 12]. These clusters can be refered
as structural heterogeneities speciﬁc to the systems under study ; they do not
occur in TOL since there is no H-bond interaction, nor in propylene glycol
[5] or ethanol [12] where the packing constraint is reduced. These clusters
do not seemingly order themselves, which is supported by the experimental
observation that the prepeak width remains essentially constant. Because of
this, the fragile character of these liquids is not altered and remains similar
to that of the van der Waals TOL or the m-Xylene where no prepeaks are
observed.

The clusters observed here have little eﬀect on the overall slowing down of
the relaxations with temperature, since it is very similar for the whole series
of substituted aromatic liquids, irrespective of the presence of a prepeak in
the S(Q). Therefore, they are presumably not related to the heterogeneities
or domains recently discussed in the litterature [1, 2].

However, the presence of clustering phenomena might induce signiﬁcant
diﬀerences in the relaxation times associated with diﬀerent probes. In the
case of MFA, the response under a mechanical stress is faster (by a factor
of 3) than that under an electrical stress [17]. In both cases, the relaxations
have roughly the same T -dependence, and the relaxation functions are highly
non-exponential with a Kolraush (stretching) exponent β of 0.37 for shear or
volume relaxations and 0.61 for dielectric relaxation [17] at the same tem-
perature T =210 K. The non-exponential character of the relaxations which
is at variance to what is observed for monohydric alcohols [3] is probably
related to the absence of a 3-dimensional network and to the polydispersity
and the limited size of the clusters. As suggested in ref. 3, the experi-
mental observations could be rationalyzed by considering that the dielectric
process is dominated by the overall motion of the clusters contrary to the
mechanical relaxation. An other interpretation could arise from recent ex-
periments [18] which suggest that the slowest Debye-type process observed
by dielectric spectroscopy for 1-propanol does is not assigned to any struc-
tural relaxation but to distinct H-bonding eﬀects. These special features due
to the H-bonding are obviously not expected in a van der Waals isostruc-
tural system like m-xylene or TOL. In the latter case, as indeed suggested
by recent work [19], the dielectric relaxation mode would not be the slowest
one. More work in this direction would be usefull to clarify the dynamical
signature of the H-bond-induced clusters in fragile liquids.

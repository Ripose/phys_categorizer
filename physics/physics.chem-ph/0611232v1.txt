In situations involving large potentials or surface charges, the Poisson Boltzman(PB) equation
has shortcomings because it neglects ion-ion interactions and steric eﬀects. This has been widely
recognized by the electrochemistry community, leading to the development of various alternative
models resulting in diﬀerent sets ”modiﬁed PB equations”, which have had at least qualitative suc-
cess in predicting equilibrium ion distributions. On the other hand, the literature is scarce in terms
of descriptions of concentration dynamics in these regimes. Here, adapting strategies developed
to modify the PB equation, we propose a simple modiﬁcation of the widely used Poisson-Nernst-
Planck (PNP) equations for ionic transport, which at least qualitatively accounts for steric eﬀects.
We analyze numerical solutions of these MPNP equations on the model problem of the charging of a
simple electrolyte cell, and compare the outcome to that of the standard PNP equations. Finally, we
repeat the asymptotic analysis of Bazant, Thornton, and Ajdari [1] for this new system of equations
to further document the interest and limits of validity of the simpler equivalent electrical circuit
models introduced in Part I for such problems.

INTRODUCTION

≫

In Part I of this series, we focused on steric eﬀects
of ﬁnite ion size on the charging dynamics of a quasi-
equilibrium electrical double layer, motivated by the
breakdown of the classical Gouy-Chapman model [2] at
large voltages (up to several Volts and
kT /e = 25
mV), e.g. which are commonly applied in AC electro-
osmosis [3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. We introduced two simple mod-
iﬁcations of the Boltzmann equilibrium distribution of
ions to incorporate steric constraints. Both new models
predicted similar dramatic consequences of steric eﬀects
at large voltages, such as greatly reduced diﬀuse-layer
capacitance and neutral salt uptake from the bulk com-
pared to the classical theory. The crucial eﬀect of the
ﬁnite ion size is to prevent the unphysical crowding of
point-like ions near the surface at large voltages by form-
ing a condensed layer of ions at the close-packing limit
(likely to include at least a solvation shell around each
ion).

The idea that the electric double layer acts like a ca-
pacitor is part of a bigger picture and suggests that the
dynamics can be described in terms of equivalent cir-
cuits
[8, 9], where the double layer remains in quasi-
equilibrium with the neutral bulk. This classical ap-
proximation has been discussed and validated in the
thin double layer limit by asymptotic analysis of the
Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) equations [1]. The PNP
equations provide the standard description of the linear-
response dynamics of electrolytes perturbed from equilib-
rium, based on the same assumption of a dilute solution
of point-like ions interacting through a mean ﬁeld which
underlies the PB equation for equilibrium [2, 10].

Here we try to account for the eﬀect of steric con-
straints on the dynamics, by ﬁrst establishing modiﬁed

PNP (MPNP) equations using linear response theory
and modiﬁed electrochemical potentials. We apply the
MPNP equations to describe the charging of a parallel
plate electrolyte cell in response to a suddenly applied
voltage and comment on the diﬀerences with usual PNP
dynamics. The results are in line with the work in Part I
since the double layer behaves like a capacitor; however
its capacitance is reduced by steric eﬀects, and neutral
salt uptake is decreased as well.

Finally, following the analysis of Bazant, Thornton,
and Ajdari [1], we demonstrate that the considerations of
Part I can rigorously be supported by asymptotic analysis
on the MPNP equations. This helps us understand the
limits of the electric double layer capacitor models and
deﬁne rigorously what is meant by the thin double layer
limit.

A. Electrolyte Dynamics in Dilute Solution Theory

As we have mentioned in Part I, the dilute solution
theory has been the default model for ion transport for
the most part of the twentieth century. According to this
theory, it is acceptable to neglect interactions between
individual ions. As a result, the electrochemical potential
takes the form

µdilute

= kT ln ci + zieψ

where zie is the charge, ci the concentration, and ψ the
electrostatic potential-usually governed by the Poisson’s

equation.
trolyte dynamics, we need to combine the above equation
with the ﬂux formula (here with the standard assumption
that interactions between diﬀerent species are negligible,

theory. In particular, a statistical model with the desired
level of detail can be set up, and after the corresponding
free energy F is calculated, the chemical potentials can
be obtained from the formula

where ε denotes the permittivity of the electrolyte. The
name Poisson-Nernst-Planck(PNP) equations is coined
for the system deﬁned by equations (4) and (5). The
standard PNP system presented above has been used to
model selectivity and ionic ﬂux in biological ion chan-
nels [14, 15, 16, 17, 18], AC pumping of liquids over
electrode arrays [3, 4, 19, 20, 21, 22], induced-charge
electro-osmotic ﬂows around metallic colloids [23, 24] and
microstructures [6, 22, 25], dielectrophoresis [26, 27, 28]
and induced-charge electrophoresis [28, 29, 30, 31] of po-
larizable particles in electrolytes.

As explained thoroughly in Part I, however, the dilute
solution theory, including the PNP equations, has limited
applicability:
its predictions easily violate its basic as-
sumption (i.e. being dilute) near surfaces of high poten-
tial. In fact, this happens more often than not due to the
exponential (Boltzmann-type) dependence of counter-ion
concentration on electrostatic potential. The steric limit,
that is cmax = 1/a3, a being the typical spacing between
densely packed ions, is reached at the critical potential

Ψc =

(6)

where c0 is the bulk electrolyte concentration of either
of the species. Due to the logarithmic dependence in its
formulation, the critical voltage Ψc is no more than a
few times the thermal voltage ψT = kT /ze and therefore
easily reached in many applications such as the induced
charge electroosmosis [23, 24]. This has motivated re-
searchers to modify the standard equations and improve
the dilute solution theory (see next subsection).

B. Beyond Dilute Solution Theory

Statistical mechanics have proved to be an indispens-
able tool for analyzing and improving the dilute solution

µi =

δF
δci

where ci is the concentration of the i-th species. Then
diﬀerential equations governing the electrolytes can eas-
ily be derived from this chemical potential as outlined in
the previous subsection. There have been many attempts
to calculate the free energy of the electrolyte more accu-
rately to improve the dilute solution theory (see below for
references). In some of these attempts, the calculation of
the free energy was replaced by an equivalent consider-
ation of mean electrostatic potential and mean charge
density [32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37]. Using those mean quanti-
ties, various correlation functions as well as new and more
accurate PB (i.e. MPB) equations have been proposed.
However, one should keep in mind that the correspond-
ing free energies can still be calculated for these models,
too.

Perhaps the ﬁrst examination of the limits of the dilute
solution theory by statistical mechanical considerations
was by Kirkwood [38] in 1934. After a detailed analysis
of the approximations of the dilute solution theory, Kirk-
wood concluded that those approximations consisted of
the neglect of an exclusion-volume term and a ﬂuctuation
term. Furthermore, he gave estimates of those terms and
argued that they are indeed negligible in the bulk elec-
trolyte. In recent years, there have been many attempt
[32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37] originating from the liquid-state
theory to calculate those neglected terms more explicitly,
which resulted in a variety of MPB equations (includ-
ing the MPB1,...,MPB5,˙.. hierarchy of Outhwaite and
Bhuiyan [33]).

Another general approach to the statistical mechan-
ics of electrolytes is based on density functional theory
(DFT). Using this formalism, Rosenfeld [39, 40, 41] sys-
tematically derived elaborate free energy functionals for
neutral and charged hard-sphere liquids starting from ba-
sic geometric considerations. Gillespie et al. [42, 43, 44]
calculated chemical potentials from Rosenfeld’s free en-
ergy functionals, and used them along with the formula
(2) to calculate the steady ﬂux in an ion channel, as well
as to investigate the equilibrium structure of the double
layer. With this theoretical framework, Roth and Gille-
spie [45] were able to explain size selectivity of biological
ion channels.

Perhaps one reason why neither the MPB hierarchy of
Outhwaite and Bhuiyan [33], nor the free energy func-
tionals of Rosenfeld [41], has gained widespread use and
recognition is their intrinsic complexity which limits their
simple application to specifc problems. For example, the
hard sphere component of Rosenfeld’s free energy density

is given by

where each of n0, n1, n2, n3, nV 1, and nV 2 are functions
deﬁned in terms of (in general 3D) integrals. So the im-
provements over the initial PB equations are made at
the cost of losing the possibility of analytical progress,
and nontrivial numerical work is required even for sim-
ple problems in one dimension.

A considerably simpler approach, which mainly focuses
on the contribution of size eﬀects to the free energy, is
based on mean-ﬁeld theory together with the lattice-gas
approximation in statistical mechanics. Following the
early work of Eigen and Wicke [46, 47, 48], Iglic and
Kral-Iglic [49, 50, 51, 52] and Borukhov, Andelman, and
Orland [53, 54, 55] were able to come up with a sim-
ple statistical mechanical treatment which captures ba-
sic size eﬀects. A free energy functional is derived by
mean-ﬁeld approximations of the entropy of equal-sized
ions and solvent molecules. This free energy is then min-
imized to obtain the equilibrium average concentration
ﬁelds, and the corresponding modiﬁed PB (MPB) equa-
tion. While more complex than the original PB equa-
tion, it is still rather compact and simple, and deﬁnitely
amenable to further analytical use.

C. Scope of the present work

All of the above authors, as well as others we have cited
in Part I, focus on the equilibrium or steady state prop-
erties of the electrolytes. In fact, we are not aware of any
attempt to go beyond the dilute solution theory (PNP
equations) in analyzing the dynamics of electrolytes in
response to time-dependent perturbations, such as AC
voltages. Here in the second part of this series, our aim
is to improve the (time-dependent) PNP equations of the
dilute solution theory by incorporating the steric eﬀects
in a simple way with the goal of identifying new generic
features. Our focus is electrolyte systems that contain
highly charged surfaces, such as an electrode applying a
large voltage V
ψT = kT /ze , where the steric eﬀects
become important quantitatively as well as qualitatively.
As in Part I, here we again adopt the mean-ﬁeld ap-
proach of Borukhov et al.[53] to the size eﬀects, because
of two main reasons: First, and foremost, it is preferable
to start with simple formulations that capture the essen-
tial physics while remaining analytically tractable, as we
are mainly interested in new qualitative phenomena. Sec-
ond, it is not clear to us how well the liquid-state theories
would perform at large, time-dependent voltages, since
they are (at least in some cases) based on perturbative
methods around an equilibrium reference state -which
may not even exist, say, in presence of an AC electric
ﬁeld.

A quick outline of the paper is as follows:

In sec-
tion II, we derive the modiﬁed Poisson Nernst-Planck
(MPNP) equations, using the free energy obtained by
[49, 53] to derive the modiﬁed PB equations (MPB). In-
stead of minimizing the free energy F we ﬁrst compute
the chemical potentials from the equation (7). Then we
describe the electrolyte dynamics by linear response re-
lations described by equations (2), (3). As a result, we
end up with the promised MPNP equations which include
steric corrections to the standard Nernst Planck equation
that become increasingly important as the concentration
ﬁeld gets large. We continue in section III by setting up
and investigating the numerical solutions of our modiﬁed
PNP equations for the problem of parallel plate block-
ing electrodes. In section IV, we follow the same lines
as in [1], and establish our earlier conclusions (includ-
ing the electric circuit picture) about electrical double
layers in Part I by a rigorous asymptotic analysis. We
also calculate higher order corrections to the thin dou-
ble layer limit, and check a posteriori the validity of the
leading order approximation. Finally, we close in section
V by some comments and possible future directions for
research.

II. DERIVATION OF MODIFIED PNP
EQUATIONS

In this section, we derive the modiﬁed PNP equations
as outlined in the introduction. For simplicity, let us re-
strict ourselves to the symmetric z : z electrolyte case.

The ﬁrst term is the self-energy of the electric ﬁeld for a
given potential applied to the boundaries (which acts as
a constraint on the acceptable potential ﬁelds), the next
two terms are the electrostatic energies of the ions. The

where we have assumed for simplicity that both types of

concentrations.

This form which is classical for close to equilibrium trans-

terms in the mobility matrix (i.e. that the gradients in

can induce a current of positive ions). Further, we
now assume that the mobilities for each type of ions are
which is consistent
the same, and equal to b = b+ = b
with the assumption that they have the same eﬀective
size a. A ﬁnal approximation is that we take this value b
to be constant, and in particular insensitive to the crowd-
ing that can occur in the electric double layers. All these
approximations will be further discussed and challenged
in subsequent work, but we proceed for the time being
with the present simpler version, which is a ﬁrst attempt
to incorporate steric eﬀects in the dynamics. As the elec-
tric ﬁelds adjusts almost instantaneously to minimize the
electrostatic energy, we get Poisson equation as

the potential by accounting as before for the possible

which is reduced by the insulating layer to ψn=0 at the

plied). λS = ε/Cs is a measure of the thickness of this
layer. Here, n is the normal direction to the surface point-
ing into the electrolyte.

III. MODEL PROBLEM FOR THE ANALYSIS
OF THE DYNAMICS

In order to gain some insight into the ramiﬁcations of
the extra term we introduced into PNP, we now turn
back to the basic model problem discussed in reference
[1]. Namely, as shown in Fig. 1, we consider the ef-
fectively one-dimensional problem of an electrolyte cell
L), ﬁlled with
bounded by two parallel walls (at x =
a z:z electrolyte, at concentration c0, and across which
a step voltage of amplitude (2V ) is suddenly applied at
t = 0. We further assume that no Faradaic reactions are
induced at the electrodes surface. We formulate MPNP
in this setting, and then compare some numerical solu-
tions of MPNP to those of PNP. In the next section we
will focus on the case where the double layer thickness
λD = (2e2c0/εkBT )−
1/2 is much smaller than the (half)
cell thickness L.

˜x = x/L. The problem is better formulated through the

system size, δ = λS/λD introduced in section II which
measures the surface capacitance, and ﬁnally a new pa-
rameter quantifying the role of steric eﬀects ν = 2a3c0,
the eﬀective volume fraction of the ions at no applied
voltage. After dropping the tildes from the variable x,

We have numerically solved these equations for various
values of the dimensionless parameters. As a complete
description of this large parameter space would be very

5

lengthy, we focus on a few situations for which we pro-
vide plots meant to illustrate the diﬀerences brought in
by accounting for steric eﬀects. We therefore also plot the
outcome of classical PNP in the same situations (which
correspond to ν = 0 in the equations). Of course a sys-
tematic diﬀerence is that with the MPNP neither the
concentration c nor the charge density ρ ever overcome
the steric limit 1/ν.

For sake of readability of the ﬁgure, we start in Fig.2
with untypically large values for both the ǫ = 0.1 and
ν = 0.25. The potential is ten times larger than the
thermal voltage υ = 10. The map of the concentration
and charge density are given for diﬀerent instants after
the application of the potential drop. Build-up of the
double layers, and the consequent depletion of salt in
the bulk are visible. The MPNP solution stays bounded
by 1/ν as promised, whereas the PNP solution blows up
exponentially. A consequent observation is that salt de-
pletion in the bulk is weaker with the MPNP, whereas
with the classical PNP bulk concentrations drop to small
values even for this moderate potential (
0.25 V in di-
mensional units). Of course, this is also a consequence of
the large ǫ.

∼

For a simulation with more realistic values, we have
taken υ = 40 (corresponding to 1 V in dimen-
sional units), and ǫ = ν = 0.01. The correspond-
ing solutions are plotted at nondimensional times t =
0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, ..., 50 in Fig.3. Figure 3(a) shows
the bulk concentration dynamics, whereas Figure 3(b) fo-
cuses on the double layer near the boundary at x =
1.
The MPNP solution again stays bounded by 1/ν = 100.
The PNP solution is not plotted as it blows up in the
1017 times the bulk
double layer to about cosh(40)
value (itself consequently very small), requiring subtle
numerical methods. With the MPNP, the charge build
up of the double layer ﬁrst proceeds as it would with the
PNP until concentrations close to the threshold 1/ν are
reached. Thereafter, charging proceeds by growth of the
double layer thickness at almost constant density.

IV. ASYMPTOTIC ANALYSIS

In this section, we adapt to the MPNP equations in-
troduced here the asymptotic analysis presented in [1]
for PNP equations in the limit of thin double layers. We
show rigourously that the key properties of the charg-
ing dynamics remain the same, namely, at leading order
the boundary layer acts like a capacitor with a total sur-
face charge density ˜q(t) that changes in response to the
Ohmic current density ¯j(t) from the bulk. However, the
expressions for the capacitance of the double layer, and
the diﬀusive ﬂux from the bulk into the double layer do
change, as we already discussed in Part I.

B. Time-dependent matching

So far we have found that both the bulk and the bound-
ary layers are in quasiequilibrium, which apparently con-
tradicts the dynamic nature of the charging process. This

is reconciled by noting once more that the boundary con-
dition for the inner solution involves the quantity ζ(t),
which varies in response to the diﬀusive ﬂux from the
bulk. Motivated by the physics, we consider the total
ǫ˜q(t), where

(t) = ¯j0(t)

(29)

which, being a balance of O(1) quantities, is reassuring
us that we have chosen the correct time-scale. This is
the key equation which tells us that at leading order, the
double layer behaves like a capacitor, whose total surface
charge density ˜q, changes in response to the transient
Faradaic current density, ¯j(t), from the bulk.

mulas, the ﬁrst term (i.e. ˜ζ0) is the voltage drop over
δ ˜q0) is
the diﬀuse layer whereas the second term (i.e.

voltages, the standard model assigns exponentially big-

the modiﬁed theory predicts a balanced distribution. For

the diﬀusion from the bulk at O(ǫ) or higher, as diﬀusion

the excess amount of salt in the double layer:

In other words, the RC
relaxation time is shortened (see Part I).

D. Neutral Salt Adsorption by the Double Layer

A natural consequence of reduced capacitance at the
electrodes is the reduction of the amplitude of the dif-
fusion layer in the bulk were the adsorbed salt in the
double layer is extracted from. We now revisit some of
the ideas in [1], and recalculate the neutral salt adsorp-
tion by the double layer. The excess ion concentration,

As expected from the underlying physics, and already
explained in Part I and illustrated in the plots of sec-
tion III above, the formula (45) predicts smaller values
for the the depth of the bulk diﬀusion than its classical
PNP (ν = 0) counterpart. This diﬀerence is more pro-
nounced at higher υ. Equation (44) is a simple approxi-
mation that describes two diﬀusion layers created at the
electodes slowly invading the entire cell. At ﬁrst,they

Of course one expects that at large enough applied

decrease in bulk concentration becomes signiﬁcant and
thus modiﬁes the value of w in the double layer.

E. Validity of the Weakly Nonlinear
Approximation

The ﬁrst order solution consisting of the variables in-
dexed by ”0” is often referred to as the weakly nonlin-
ear approximation, whose main feature is that the bulk
concentrations are constant, namely ¯c
¯c0 = 1 and
¯ρ0 = 0. The system therefore is characterized only by
¯ρ
˜q0, or the double layer potential

diﬀerence ˜Ψ
˜Ψ0, which is governed by the nonlinear
ODE in equation (33). This corresponds to modeling
the problem by an equivalent circuit model with vari-
able capacitance for the double layer, and constant bulk
electrolyte resistance.

In order to understand when the weakly nonlinear ap-
proximation holds, we can compare the size of the next
order approximation to the leading term. Although not a
rigorous proof, one may argue that if
is much smaller
than ¯c0 = 1, then leading order term is a good approx-
imation to the full solution. We will get help from the
approximations (47) and (48) to see if this is the case.

Seen in the light of equation (48), the assumption
that the ﬁrst correction is much smaller than the leading
term requires that νb = ǫ ˜w0 (

For a typical experiment with λD = 10 nm, L = 0.1mm,
c0 = 1mM, a = 5 ˚A, and at room temperature, this con-
dition becomes V

188 Volts.

However, the weakly nonlinear dynamics breaks down
at somewhat smaller voltages, because the neutral salt
adsorption causes a temporary, local depletion of bulk
concentration exceeding that of the ﬁnal steady state. In
our model problem, the maximum change in bulk concen-
tration occurs just outside the diﬀuse layers at x =
1,
just after the initial charging process ﬁnishes at the same
scale t = O(1) or ¯t = O(ǫ). Letting ¯t = ǫ, and x =

The corresponding threshold voltage is smaller than the

former by a factor of roughly
same set of parameter as above λD = 10 nm, L = 0.1mm,
c0 = 1mM, a = 5 ˚A, and at room temperature, this con-
dition gives V
0.033 Volts. Thus according to this cri-
terion, the weakly nonlinear approximation easily breaks
down, and one may need to consult to the full MPNP
system for an understanding of the electrolyte dynamics.
A more accurate understanding into the condition (50)
is gained by the numerical study of the function w. The

curves on which √ǫw = 1 (i.e. ǫ = w−
Fig.4 for various values of ν (here we dropped the some-
what arbitrary factor √π in (50)).The weakly nonlinear
approximation holds to the south-west of these curves
when √ǫw
1. The criterion given by the inequality
(51) corresponds to the asymptotic behaviour of those
curves as υ tends to inﬁnity.

≪

To observe that this is the case numerically, we have
also compared the charging dynamics given by the weakly
nonlinear approximation to that of the full MPNP solu-
tion in Fig.5. with the parameters ǫ = ν = 0.01. When
the parameters were to the south-west of the √ǫw = 1,
as in case (c), the match was perfect. In the other cases,
the weakly nonlinear approximation did not do as well, it
was particularly oﬀ for case (b), when the product √ǫw
yielded the highest number. In case (a), the agreement
was oﬀ by a constant shift, whereas in case (d), the situa-
tion improved over time. This is because ǫw is still small
for case (d), although √ǫw is not, and therefore weakly
nonlinear approximation is still valid for the ﬁnal state
of the system. To summarize, if an accurate description
of the system at all times is desired, then √ǫw << 1 is
the appropriate criterion, however it may suﬃce to have
just ǫw << 1 to be able to predict the eventual steady
state by the weakly nonlinear model.

V. CONCLUSIONS

As an extension of the modiﬁed PB approach, we have
derived modiﬁed PNP equations, which may be of help
when the thin double layer approximation fails. Using
this new set of equations, we have revisited the model
problem of the step charging of a cell with parallel block-
ing electrodes. In addition, we have conﬁrmed through
asymptotic analysis the hypotheses stated in Part I re-
garding the MPB double layer model. We have also inves-
tigated the limits of the thin double layer approximation
as well as higher order corrections.

The MPNP system proposed is a natural extension
of one of the two models introduced in Part I, namely
the MPB model based on an approach originally due
to [49, 53]. One can similarly construct other MPNP
equations from other MPB models such as the composite

10

diﬀuse-layer model also introduced in Part I. However the
discontinuous structure of the latter leads to a complex
formalism with discontinuities, improper for implemen-

tation in complex geometries, whereas the one presented
here has a smooth behavior and is therefore much more
broadly applicable.

We expect that the MPNP equations presented here,
or other simple variations with diﬀerent modiﬁcations of
the chemical potentials or free energy, will ﬁnd many
applications. They are no more diﬃcult to use than the
classical PNP equations, which are currently ubiquitous
in the modeling of electrochemical systems. Especially
at large voltages, the MPNP equations are much better
suited for numerical computations, since they lack the
exponentially diverging concentrations predicted by the
PNP equations, which are diﬃcult to resolve. Of course,
those same divergences are also clearly unphysical, while
the MPNP equations predict reasonable ion proﬁle for
any applied voltage.

Future research directions include the application of
the presented framework to many other settings including
the response of the simple electrolytic cell considered here
to various systems with time-dependent applied voltages
of strong amplitudes. In particular, driving an electro-
chemical cell or AC electro-osmotic pump at rather large
frequencies should be a selective way of checking the va-
lidity/use of equations such as the one put forward here
because dynamical eﬀects are exacerbated in such situa-
tions.

FIG. 5: Four case studies on the validity of the weakly nonlin-
ear approximation. No stern capacitance is included (δ = 0).
(I) The √ǫw = 1 curve for the particular value ν = 0.01, and
corresponding locations of the four case studies shown. (II)
The comparison of the charge q(t) stored in the half cell com-
puted by (i) the MPNP (ii) the weakly nonlinear approxima-
tion corresponding to the MPNP. The match in (c) is good as
expected, and the match in (b) is oﬀ by several factors, again
as expected. In cases (a) and (d), the curves run close but
they are clearly separated.

We present the APLIP process (Adiabatic Passage by
Light Induced Potentials) for the adiabatic transfer of a wave
packet from one molecular potential to the displaced ground
vibrational state of another. The process uses an intermedi-
ate state, which is only slightly populated, and a counterin-
tuitive sequence of light pulses to couple the three molecular
states. APLIP shares many features with STIRAP (stimu-
lated Raman adiabatic passage), such as high eﬃciency and
insensitivity to pulse parameters. However, in APLIP there
is no two-photon resonance, and the main mechanism for the
transport of the wave packet is a light-induced potential. The
APLIP process appears to violate the Franck-Condon princi-
ple, because of the displacement of the wave packet, but does
in fact take place on timescales which are at least a little
longer than a vibrational timescale.

Femtosecond pulses have recently opened the possibil-
ity to create, observe and control the internal dynamics
of molecules [1,2]. Typically one has studied the pump-
probe situation, where a molecular wave packet, i.e., a co-
herent superposition of vibrational states, has been cre-
ated by the ﬁrst pulse, and a second pulse probes the
subsequent evolution of the wave packet. Alternatively
one can observe the dissociation process directly. In more
subtle cases, such as the pump and dump schemes, the
ﬁnal result can be some special molecular bound state
instead of dissociation. Such manipulations provide new
understanding of molecular dynamics and chemical re-
actions. Also, they present intriguing demonstrations of
wave packet dynamics and time-dependent quantum me-
chanics in general.

The purpose of this Letter is to demonstrate (theo-
retically) a mechanism for the transfer of a stationary
ground state vibrational wave packet to a stationary and
displaced excited state wave packet through an intermedi-
ate state which is not signiﬁcantly populated during the
process. The overall eﬀect is symbolically represented by
the diagonal arrow in Fig. 1. Of course, we can change
from a wave packet picture of the process to a picture in
terms of the vibrational levels, in which case Fig. 1 illus-
trates a process where the population of the ν = 0 vibra-
tional level of the ground state is directly transferred to
the ν′′ = 0 vibrational level of the second excited state.
The overall eﬀect appears as a violation of the Franck-
Condon principle, which can be simply stated as saying

1

that there should only be vertical transitions between vi-
brational states in a molecule, at least, over short times.
Thus the diagonal transition seen in Fig. 1 should not be
allowed. It is further inhibited by the fact that the over-
lap between the initial and ﬁnal wave functions is very
small (the Franck-Condon overlap). This is because the
initial wave packet is displaced over a distance of about
seven times its width for the example of Fig. 1. Of course,
there is no real violation of the Franck-Condon principle;
we manipulate the molecular states on timescales close
to, but longer than the vibrational timescales.

g ground state, the A1Σ+

To illustrate the process we have chosen the sodium
dimer, a molecule which has already been subjected to
much study in the ﬁeld of wave packet dynamics, and
which opens the prospect of an experiment to test the
ideas in this Letter. Following Refs. [3] we have chosen
our three states so that the ground state is the X1Σ+
g
of Na2, the ﬁrst excited state is the A1Σ+
u state, and
the second excited state is the 21Πg state. Data for the
molecular potentials has been gathered from Refs. [3,4]
and this data is used in a numerical calculation of the
dynamics of the wave packet during the interaction of
the system with two laser pulses.

In terms of the electronic potentials the Hamiltonian

for the vibrational motion of the molecule is

where R is the internuclear separation, m is the reduced

Here UX(R), UA(R), and UΠ(R) are the three potentials,
δ1 and δ2 are the detunings of the two pulses from the
lowest points of the potentials, and Ω1(t) = µXAE1(t)/¯h,
Ω2(t) = µAΠE2(t)/¯h are the two Rabi frequencies. We
have assumed for simplicity that the two dipole moments
are independent of R and we solve the time-dependent
Schr¨odinger equation with Hamiltonian (1) by a numer-
ical method (see, e.g. Ref. [2]).

Figure 2 shows an example of the wave packet dynam-
ics following the coupling of two pulses between each pair
of molecular states. In Fig. 2(a) we see at t = 0 the ini-
tial ground state wave packet, located at the equilibrium
position of 3.08 ˚A, in the X1Σ+
g potential. When the two
Gaussian laser pulses (with peak intensities of 3 and 6
TW/cm2) act on the molecule we see the disappearance
of the wave packet from the X1Σ+
g state, while it is also
displaced to the right (to larger distances). As the wave
packet disappears from the X1Σ+
g state it appears on the
excited 21Πg state [see Fig. 2(b)], still being displaced to
longer bond lengths as it appears. When the laser pulses
have completed, the wave packet is left in the 21Πg state
without any vibrational excitation (there is no motion of
the wave packet).

During the process seen in Fig. 2 the X1Σ+

g and 21Πg
states exchange their population while the population of
the A1Σ+
u state remains very low at all times. The pro-
cess is nearly 100% eﬃcient in transferring population
from the X1Σ+
g state to the 21Πg state. This eﬃciency
remains high over a wide range of pulse parameters.

The process we have described uses a counterintu-
the pulse nearly resonant with
itive pulse sequence:
the X1Σ+
g → A1Σ+
u transition is applied after the pulse
nearly resonant with the A1Σ+
u → 21Πg transition. How-
ever, the process is not the same as the conventional STI-
RAP [5–7] (Stimulated Raman Adiabatic Passage) pro-
cess, already seen in molecular systems [6], for both triv-
ial and fundamental reasons. The most trivial diﬀerence
with the existing experiments is the linkage pattern; the
ladder system we consider (Fig. 1) has a diﬀerent link-
age pattern from the Raman type Λ system after which
STIRAP is named. In the absence of spontaneous emis-
sion [8], these diﬀerent linkage patterns do not aﬀect the
dynamics in the case of atomic systems [7].

Because we utilize a ladder system it makes sense
to consider a transition from X1Σ+
g (ν = 0) to 21Πg
(ν′′ = 0), i.e., from the ground vibrational state of the

motion has been determined from a fully quantum mechanical
calculation. In (a) the ground state wave packet disappears
when the two pulses arrive at t=10.8 ps and 16.3 ps. In (b)
we see the slow and steady appearence of the wave packet
in the 21Πg state. Note the steady displacement of the wave
packet as it arrives adiabatically to the bottom of the low-
est vibrational state of the 21Πg state. Both pulses are red

lowest electronic state to the ground vibrational state of
the highest electronic state in our three-level system. In
a Λ-type Raman scheme this would not make sense as
STIRAP is then used to create an excited vibrational
state (ν 6= 0) from the ground state (ν = 0) within the
same electronic state of the molecule.

Conventional STIRAP utilizes a two-photon resonance
condition. For example, a suitable Hamiltonian for STI-
RAP in an atomic ladder system is

where ∆ is the two-photon resonant laser-atom detuning,
and Ω1 and Ω2 are the Rabi frequencies of the pump
pulse and Stokes pulse. If the pump and Stokes pulses
change suﬃciently slowly, we can consider the process
to be adiabatic. Then we can utilize the instantaneous

to achieve the transfer directly from state 1 to state 3.
We note that the state ψz is for all t an exact eigenstate
of Ha, Eq. (3), with eigenvalue zero (sometimes called
a ‘dark state’ [9]).
If the pulses are in the counterin-
tuitive order, i.e., Ω2(t) reaches its peak before Ω1(t),
the eigenstate (4) matches the initial state of the system
(state 1). Since, for long pulses, the system state adia-
batically follows the state ψz, the occupation probability
is transported from state 1 to state 3. Because state 2
is not involved in the eigenstate ψz, it is not populated
during the pulse sequence.

The situation for the molecule is rather diﬀerent be-
cause we have an extra degree of freedom: the molecular
co-ordinate which we denote by R. With the Hamiltonian
now given by Eq. (1), and the spatially varying poten-
tials (2), it is clear that it is impossible in this molecular
case to have the two-photon resonance condition used in
the atomic case (except at isolated points). Thus there
is no zero eigenstate in the molecular situation.

At this point it could be argued that rather than view-
ing the Hamiltonian (1) in the position basis, we should
utilize a vibrational basis so that we could recover a ver-
sion of the atomic STIRAP process seen with the Hamil-
tonian (3). However, whilst the vibrational picture and
the spatial picture are entirely equivalent, we believe that
the key to understanding the phenomenon in Fig. 2 is not
the vibrational basis but a spatial picture. This brings
us to a fundamental diﬀerence between STIRAP and the
phenomena in this Letter. If we had a STIRAP process
taking the system from the X1Σ+
g (ν = 0) vibrational
state to the 21Πg (ν′′ = 0) vibrational state we would
only see the disappearance of the wave packet in Fig. 2(a)
and its reappearance in Fig. 2(b) without the smooth po-
sitional shifting of the wave packet. The reason is that
the X1Σ+
g (ν = 0) vibrational state wave function will
be approximately the ground vibrational wave function
of a harmonic oscillator, and any positional movement of
the wave packet must be due to the excitation of other
vibrational states. We can say the same thing about the
21Πg (ν′′ = 0) vibrational state, i.e., that if only the
(ν′′ = 0) were involved there would be no shifting of the
wave packet as seen in Fig. 2(b). So the process of Fig. 2
g and 21Πg.
is not direct STIRAP transfer between X1Σ+
Our explanation for the transfer of the wave packet
in the manner seen in Fig. 2 relies on light-induced po-
tentials [10]. For wave packets that travel suﬃciently
slowly through systems of coupled potential surfaces the
nature of the ﬁeld-dressed potential energy surfaces be-
comes more important than the bare (i.e., not coupled by
light) energy surfaces. This means, for example, that a
laser induced crossing becomes an avoided crossing with

an energy gap which increases with the intensity of the
laser. The energy gap can become large enough to allow
the passage of a wave packet which would not otherwise
penetrate the crossing; this leads to bond softening [11].
The eigenvalues of (2) determine the light-induced po-
tentials and in Fig. 3 we show the most relevant one as a
function of space and time. The most striking feature is
the kinked channel which is responsible for guiding the
wave packet from one position to another.

FIG. 3.

Space and time dependence of the light-induced
potential responsible for the transportation of the wave packet
in Fig. 2.

At t = 0 the light-induced potential of Fig. 3 is com-
prised of the X1Σ+
g potential on the left hand side of the
picture, and of the 21Πg potential on the right hand side
of the picture.
In eﬀect there is a very small avoided
crossing of these two potentials near R = 3.4 ˚A. The
crossing is small because at t = 0 the two laser ﬁelds
are very weak. As a result there are two wells in the
ﬁeld-dressed state at t = 0, one belonging to the X1Σ+
g
state, where the initial wave packet resides, and the other
belonging to the 21Πg state, which is where we aim to
transfer the wave packet. Because of the red detuning
of the two pulses, the ﬁeld-dressed state corresponding
to the intermediate A1Σ+
u state (at t = 0) lies well be-
low the ﬁeld-dressed potential of Fig. 3. However, as the
u → 21Πg transition turns
pulse resonant with the A1Σ+
on there is a repulsion between the A-type (A1Σ+
u at
t = 0) ﬁeld-dressed state and the rhs of the ﬁeld-dressed
state in Fig. 3 (which is Π-like). This repulsion results
in the disappearance of the rhs channel in Fig. 3. The
repulsion also moves the A-Π avoided crossing to larger
internuclear separations.

3

When the second pulse is turning on, the repulsion
between the X part of the state in Fig. 3 and the lower
A state pushes the main channel upwards in energy and
also displaces it to the right because the right hand part
of the state in Fig. 3 has more of the Π character, and
is not repelled from the A state by the second pulse. As
the ﬁrst pulse dies away the transfer of the wave packet
completes with the approach of an avoided crossing from
small internuclear separations. Eventually this avoided
crossing becomes the same X-Π avoided crossing seen
near t = 0, so we again have two wells in the potential.

It can be clearly seen from Fig. 3 that we need to have
a counterintuitive sequence of pulses. Having an intuitive
sequence would be like starting from the rear of Fig. 3 in
the left hand well. But the left hand well is a dead end.
Only the right hand well lies in the channel connecting
the wave packet through the pulse sequence. Because
the process is carried out slowly (adiabatically), the orig-
inal wave packet can not only be transported from one
space position to another but also can change its shape
at the same time. For example, if the Π state had a much
narrower potential (high vibrational frequency) the same
sequence of pulses could be carried out and the wave
packet would be adiabatically squeezed as it moves along
the light-induced channel into its ﬁnal state.

The treatment presented here has been restricted to
only three levels in the sodium dimer. There is always the
possibility that other neighbouring energy levels could
disturb the counterintuitive process by complicating the
dressed state potential seen in Fig. 3. This will be sub-
ject to further investigation. Fortunately the scheme pre-
sented in this Letter is extremely insensitive to the spe-
ciﬁc parameters (Rabi frequency and detuning) once the
appropriate regime has been discovered. Thus we expect
that there is enough freedom in the controlling parame-
ters to avoid any detrimental eﬀects from other levels.

We have described a process for the eﬃcient transfer
of a wave packet from one molecular potential to another
by means of light-induced potentials. We have demon-
strated it with the sodium dimer using realistic pulse
parameters and potentials. A suitable name for the pro-
cess is Adiabatic Passage by Light Induced Potentials
(APLIP). The process is not only eﬃcient, but usable
over a wide range of counterintuitive pulse parameters.
The range of parameters is even wider than in a corre-
sponding STIRAP excitation because we do not maintain
a precise two-photon resonance, and do not have the pos-
sibility of excitation of neighbouring vibrational levels.
The process can also be quite fast, almost on vibrational
timescales.

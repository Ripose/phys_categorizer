CURRENT-VOLTAGE RELATIONS FOR ELECTROCHEMICAL
THIN FILMS

MARTIN Z. BAZANT†, KEVIN T. CHU†, AND B. J. BAYLY‡

Abstract. The dc response of an electrochemical thin ﬁlm, such as the separator in a micro-
battery, is analyzed by solving the Poisson-Nernst-Planck equations, subject to boundary conditions
appropriate for an electrolytic/galvanic cell. The model system consists of a binary electrolyte be-
tween parallel-plate electrodes, each possessing a compact Stern layer, which mediates Faradaic
reactions with nonlinear Butler-Volmer kinetics. Analytical results are obtained by matched asymp-
totic expansions in the limit of thin double layers and compared with full numerical solutions. The
analysis shows that (i) decreasing the system size relative to the Debye screening length decreases
the voltage of the cell and allows currents higher than the classical diﬀusion-limited current; (ii) ﬁ-
nite reaction rates lead to the important possibility of a reaction-limited current; (iii) the Stern-layer
capacitance is critical for allowing the cell to achieve currents above the reaction-limited current; and
(iv) all polarographic (current-voltage) curves tend to the same limit as reaction kinetics become fast.
Dimensional analysis, however, shows that “fast” reactions tend to become “slow” with decreasing
system size, so the nonlinear eﬀects of surface polarization may dominate the dc response of thin
ﬁlms.

Introduction. Micro-electrochemical systems pose interesting problems for ap-
plied mathematics because traditional “macroscopic” approximations of electroneu-
trality and thermal equilibrium [1], which make the classical transport equations more
tractable [2], break down at small scales, approaching the Debye screening length. Of
course, the relative importance of surface phenomena also increases with miniatur-
ization. Micro-electrochemical systems of current interest include ion channels in
biological membranes [3, 4, 5] and thin-ﬁlm batteries [6, 7, 8, 9, 10], which could rev-
olutionize the design of modern electronics with distributed on-chip power sources.
In the latter context, the internal resistance of the battery is related to the nonlinear
current-voltage characteristics of the separator, consisting of a thin-ﬁlm electrolyte
(solid, liquid, or gel) sandwiched between ﬂat electrodes and interfacial layers where
Faradaic electron-transfer reactions occur [11]. Under such conditions, the internal
resistance is unlikely to be simply constant, as is usually assumed.

Motivated by the application to thin-ﬁlm batteries, here we revisit the classical
problem of steady conduction between parallel, ﬂat electrodes, studied by Nernst [12]
and Brunner [13, 14] a century ago. As in subsequent studies of liquid [15, 16] and
solid [17, 18] electrolytes, we do not make Nernst’s assumption of bulk electroneutral-
ity and work instead with the Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) equations, allowing for
diﬀuse charge in solution [1, 2]. What distinguishes our analysis from previous work
on current-voltage relations (or “polarographic curves”) is the use of more realistic
nonlinear boundary conditions describing (i) Butler-Volmer reaction kinetics and (ii)
the surface capacitance of the compact Stern layer, as in the recent paper of Bon-
nefont et. al [19]. Such boundary conditions, although complicating mathematical
analysis, generally cannot be ignored in micro-electrochemical cells, where interfaces
play a crucial role. Diﬀuse-charge dynamics, which can be important for high-power

applications, also complicates analysis [20], but in most cases it is reasonable to as-
sume that electrochemical thin ﬁlms are in steady state, due to the short distances
for electro-diﬀusion.

We stress, however, that steady state does not imply thermal equilibrium when
the system sustains a current, driven by an applied voltage. In this paper, we focus
on applied voltages small enough to justify the standard boundary-layer analysis of
the PNP equations, which yields charge densities in thermal equilibrium at leading
order in the limit of thin double layers [21]. In a companion paper [22], we extend
the analysis to larger voltages, at [23] and above [24] the Nernst’s diﬀusion-limited
current, and show how more realistic boundary conditions aﬀect diﬀuse charge, far
from thermal equilibrium. In both cases, we obtain novel formulae for polarographic
curves by asymptotic analysis in the limit of thin double layers, which we compare with
numerical solutions, and we focus on a variety of dimensionless physical parameters:
the reaction-rate constants (scaled to the typical diﬀusive ﬂux) and the ratios of the
Stern length to the Debye length to the electrode separation.

1. Mathematical Model. Let us consider uniform conduction through a di-
lute, binary electrolyte between parallel plate electrodes separated by a distance,
L. Our goal is to determine the steady-state response of the electrochemical cell
to either an applied voltage, V , or an applied current, I. Speciﬁcally, we seek the
(X) of cations and
electric potential Φ(X) and the concentrations C+(X) and C
anions in the region 0
L. The Faradaic current is driven by redox reactions
occurring at the electrodes, and we neglect any other chemical reactions, such as dis-
sociation/recombination in the bulk solution or hydrogen production. Since we do
not assume electroneutrality, the region of integration extends to the point where the
continuum approximation breaks down near each electrode, roughly a few molecules
away. In other words, our integration region includes the “diﬀuse part” but not the
“compact part” of the double layer [1, 11, 25, 26].

Due to the potentially large electric ﬁelds in thin ﬁlms, as in interfacial double
layers, these classical approximations could break down [1, 25, 26]. For example, the
polarization of solvent molecules in large electric ﬁelds can lower the solvent dielectric

permittivity by an order of magnitude, while also aﬀecting the diﬀusivity and mobility.
The solution can also become locally so concentrated or depleted of certain ions as
to make ﬁnite sizes and/or interactions (and thus ionic activities) important. In spite
of these concerns, however, it is reasonable to analyze the PNP equations before
considering more complicated transport models, especially because our focus is on
the eﬀect of boundary conditions.

1.2. Electrode Boundary Conditions. Although PNP equations constitute a
well-understood and widely accepted approximation, appropriate boundary conditions
for them are not so clear, and drastic approximations, such as constant concentration,
potential or surface charge (or zeta potential), are usually made, largely out of math-
ematical convenience. On the other hand, in the context of electric circuit models for
electrochemical cells [20, 27, 28], much eﬀort has been made to describe the nonlin-
ear response of the electrode-electrolyte interface, while describing the bulk solution
as a simple circuit element, such as resistor. Here, we formulate general boundary
conditions based on classical models of the double layer [11, 25, 26], with a uniﬁed
description of ion transport by the PNP equations.

Our ﬁrst pair of boundary conditions sets the normal anion ﬂux to zero at each

on the assumption that anions do not speciﬁcally adsorb onto the surfaces, which holds
for many anions at typical metal surfaces (e.g. SO−
4 , OH−, F−). The second pair
relates the normal cation ﬂux to the net deposition (or dissolution) ﬂux, or reaction-
rate density, R(C+, ∆ΦS), which in the dilute limit is assumed to depend only on
cation concentration and potential drop, ∆ΦS, across the compact part of the double
layer, originally proposed by Stern [30]. Following the convention in electrochemistry,
we take ∆ΦS to be the potential of the electrode surface measured relative to the
solution. The reference potential is chosen so that the cathode, located at X = 0, is
at zero potential and the anode, located at X = 1, is at the applied cell voltage V .
Therefore, we have the following two boundary conditions,

Following Frumkin [31], we apply Eq. (8) just outside the Stern layer, in contrast
to “macroscopic” models which postulate the Butler-Volmer equation as a purely
empirical description of reactions between the electrode surface and the electrically
neutral bulk solution. Physically, the Frumkin approach makes more sense since the
activation energy barrier described by the Butler-Volmer equation actually exists at
the atomic scale in the Stern layer, not across the entire “interface” including diﬀuse
charge in solution. We are not aware of any prior analysis with the full, nonlinear
Butler-Volmer equation as a boundary condition on the PNP equations other than
that of Bonnefont et al. [19]. Earlier analyses by Jaﬀ´e et. al.[15, 16] and Itskovich
et. al.[17] also include electrode reactions, but only for small perturbations around
equilibrium.

The ﬁnal pair of boundary conditions determines the electric potential by spec-
ifying the voltage drop across the Stern layer in terms of the local electric ﬁeld and

In macroscopic electrochemistry, these boundary conditions are usually replaced by
the assuption of electroneutrality (which eliminates the need to solve Poisson’s equa-
tion) or by simple Dirichlet boundary conditions on the potential [1].
In colloidal
science, they are likewise replaced by simple boundary conditions of constant surface
charge (or zeta potential) [32, 33]. Here, we incorporate more realistic properties of
the interface as follows: Neglecting the speciﬁc adsorption of anions, the Stern layer
acts as a nonlinear capacitor in series with the diﬀuse layer. Grahame’s celebrated
electrocapillary measurements [34, 35] suggest that (i) the Stern layer capacitance,
CS, is roughly independent of concentration, depending mainly on the (variable) total
charge, σ,

and (ii) dilute solution theory accurately describes the capacitance, CD(σ, C+), of
the diﬀuse layer, at least when the charge and current are small enough to be well-
described by Poisson-Boltzmann theory (as derived below). Using Gauss’ law, the
surface charge density can be expressed in terms of the normal electric ﬁeld, σ =
ǫSdΦ/dX, where ǫS is an eﬀective permittivity of the compact layer. Therefore,

function, CS(σ), should be ﬁt to experimental or theoretical electrocapillary curves
at large concentrations (since 1/Ctotal = 1/CD + 1/CS ≈
The simplest model that captures this interplay between the compact and diﬀuse
layers is the Stern model [11, 26], which assumes the capacitance of the compact
layer, CS, to be constant [30]. While more complicated models for the compact
layer have been proposed [36, 37, 25], the Stern model suﬃces for our purposes,
because it allows us to describe surface capacitance easily in the context of our model
of Faradaic reactions. Following Itskovich et al. [17] and Bonnefont et al. [19], let
us introduce an eﬀective width, λS, for the compact layer, λS = ǫS/CS, so that
Eq. (12) reduces to a linear extrapolation of the potential across the compact layer,
∆ΦS = λSdΦ/dx. Substituting this expression into Eqs. (9) and (10) yields two

completing a set of six boundary conditions for our three second-order diﬀerential
equations. Physically, the Stern layer, as an eﬀective solvation shell for the electrode,
is only a few molecules wide, so it is best to think of λS as simply a measure of the
capacitance of the Stern layer. More generally, the same boundary condition could
also describe a thin dielectric layer on the electrode [38, 39, 40], e.g. arising from
surface contamination or a passivating monolayer.

Note that since the anion ﬂux is zero, the current passing through the cell is

proportional to the cation ﬂux (everywhere in the cell, since it is constant),

where A is the electrode area and a current ﬂow towards the cathode (x = 0) is
taken to be positive. Under potentiostatic conditions, the cell voltage V is given,
and the steady-state polarization curve I(V ) is determined by solving the equations.
Conversely, under galvanostatic conditions, I is ﬁxed, and we solve for V (I).

1.3. An Integral Constraint. As formulated above, the boundary value prob-
lem is not well-posed. Since the anion ﬂux is constant throughout the cell according to
Eq. (2), the two anion ﬂux boundary conditions are degenerate, leaving one constant
of integration undetermined. This is not surprising as we have omitted one crucial
physical parameter, the total number of anions. More precisely, because anions do
not react, we must specify their total number, which remains constant as the steady
state is reached. This corresponds to the constraint,

where Cref is the initial concentration of anions.

Note that the total number of cations (and hence the total charge) is not known
a priori because the removal of cations at the cathode and the injection of cations at
the anode may signiﬁcantly alter their total number. This may seem counter-intuitive
since we are accustomed to assuming that we know the total cation concentration
at all times based on the original molarity of the solution, but this “macroscopic”

6

thinking does not apply when the physics at the microscopic level are explicitly being
studied (e.g. diﬀuse charge layers or micro-electrochemical systems). Mathematically,
the reaction boundary conditions at the electrodes Eqs. (6) and (7) are suﬃcient to
determine the total cation concentration (and total charge), as long as the total anion
concentration is speciﬁed.

1.4. Dimensionless Formulation. To facilitate our analysis, we formulate the
problem in dimensionless form. For simplicity we also assume that the electrolyte is

It is important to note that we have scaled the eﬀective Stern layer width, λS,
with the Debye screening length, λD, rather than the electrode separation L, thus
introducing the factor ǫ = λD/L in Eqs. (27) and (28). This choice is important for
0 at ﬁxed δ, which is intended to describe
our asymptotic analysis of the limit ǫ
situations in which L is much larger than both λS and λD. Without it, our analysis
would assume that as ǫ

the diﬀuse layer, even though it is mainly the macroscopic electrode separation which
varies. The limit of very small Stern layer capacitance, which amounts to the Helmoltz

In our work, we shall
consider both limits, starting with the assumption that δ = O(1), which corresponds
to the Gouy-Chapman-Stern model of the double layer [11, 26].

For one-dimensional problems, galvanostatic conditions are more mathematically
convenient than potentiostatic conditions. In the former case, ı is given, and v(ı) is
easily obtained from the Stern boundary condition at the anode Eq. (28).
In the
latter case, however, v is speciﬁed and ı(v) must be determined self-consistently to
satisfy Eq. (28). Therefore, we shall assume that the current ı is speciﬁed and solve
Eqs. (24)–(26) subject to the boundary conditions Eqs. (29) and (30) and the integral
constraint Eq. (31).

2. Boundary-layer Analysis. In this section, we brieﬂy review the classi-
cal asymptotic analysis of the PNP equations, pioneered independently by Cher-
nenko [44], Newman [21], and MacGillivray [45], which involves boundary layers of
width, ǫ (corresponding to diﬀuse-charge layers of dimensional width, λD). As dis-
cussed below, the classical asymptotics breaks down at large currents approaching

diﬀusion limitation. Unlike most previous authors, who assume either a ﬁxed po-
tential [42, 43] or ﬁxed interfacial charge [21] at an isolated electrode or ﬁxed con-
centrations at cell boundaries with ion-permeable membranes [4, 5, 24], we solve for
the response of a complete, two-electrode galvanic cell with boundary conditions for
Faradaic reactions and Stern-layer capacitance.

Throughout this section, the reader may refer to Figure 1, which compares the
uniform asymptotic solutions derived below to numerical solutions at several values of
ǫ. These ﬁgures illustrate the structure of the ﬁeld variables in the cell as well as give
an indication of the quality of the asymptotic solutions. The numerical solutions are
obtained by a straightforward iterative spectral method, described in a companion
paper [22].

2.1. Electroneutrality in the Bulk Solution . The most fundamental ap-
proximation in electrochemistry is that of bulk electroneutrality [1]. As ﬁrst em-
phasized by Newman [21], however, this does not mean that the charge density is
vanishing or unimportant, but rather that over macroscopic distances the charge den-
sity is small compared to the total concentration,

At leading order in the bulk, we have recovered the classical theory dating back
a century to Nernst [12, 13, 14]. The solution is electrically neutral with a linear
concentration proﬁle whose slope is proportional to the current. This approximation
leads to one of the fundamental concepts in electrochemistry, that there exists a
“limiting current”, ı = 1, or

(40)

I = Id =

4zF D+Cref A
L

,

corresponding to zero concentration at the cathode, co = 1
ı = 0. The current is
limited by the maximum rate of mass transfer allowed by diﬀusion, and larger currents
would lead to unphysical and mathematically inconsistent negative concentrations (see
Appendix A).

−

Examination of the electric ﬁeld exposes the same limitation on the current: a
singularity exists at ı = 1 that blocks larger currents from being attained. The leading
order bulk approximation to the electric ﬁeld, ¯E(0) = 1/[x + (1
ı)/2ı], diverges near
1. This would imply that the cell voltage
the cathode like 1/x in the limit ı
v (calculated below) diverges as ı
1, thus providing a satisfactory theory of the
limiting current since an inﬁnite voltage would be necessary to exceed (or even attain)
it. Unfortunately, this classical picture due to Nernst [12], based on passing to the
singular limit ǫ = 0, is not valid for any ﬁnite value of ǫ because the solution is, in
general, unable to satisfy all of the boundary conditions.

2.2. Diﬀuse Charge Layers in Thermal Equilibrium. We now derive the
leading order description of the boundary layers in the standard way [21, 5, 26, 1],
using Eqs. (24)–(25). The singular perturbation in Eq. (26) can be eliminated with
the rescaling y = x/ǫ indicating that the boundary layer at x = 0 has a width O(ǫ).

the appropriate inner variable is y = (1

above except that ı is replaced with

it entering the cathode boundary layer.

While this equation appears to contradict the fact that the current is nonzero, the

harmonic potential in the bulk region: tiny ﬂuctuations about the boundary layer
equilibrium concentration proﬁles at O(ǫ) are ampliﬁed by a scaling factor of 1/ǫ to
sustain the O(1) current. Thus, the leading order contribution to the current in the
boundary layer is

In the anodic boundary layer, we ﬁnd the same set of equations as Eqs. (41)-(43)

constants of integration. Thus, we ﬁnd that the leading order description of the anodic

0.01
in Figure 1, the leading-order uniformly valid solutions are very accurate for ǫ
(or L
100λD) and reasonably good for ǫ = 0.1. Since higher-order terms are not
analytically tractable, it seems numerical solutions must suﬃce for nanolayers, where
ǫ

1, or else other limits of various parameters must be considered, as below.
The discrepancy in electric potential proﬁle at large ǫ in Figure 1 is particularly in-
teresting because it arises from a constraint on the total potential drop across the cell.

ELECTROCHEMICAL CURRENT-VOLTAGE RELATIONS

To understand the origin of this voltage constraint, recall that the total cell voltage
is determined by the current density ﬂowing through the cell (via the voltage-current
relationship). While ǫ is technically a parameter in the voltage-current relationship,
a leading-order analysis does not capture the ǫ dependence. Thus, the leading-order
cell voltage must be the same for all ǫ which is what we observe in ﬁgure 1. A close
examination of the potential and electric ﬁeld proﬁles reveals that most of the error in
the asymptotic solution for the potential comes from an over prediction of the electric
ﬁeld strength (and therefore the potential drop) in cathode region.

3. Polarographic Curves for Thin Double Layers, ǫ

0. The relationship
between current and cell voltage is of primary importance in the study of any elec-
trochemical system, so we now use the results from the previous section to calculate
theoretical polarographic curves in several physically relevant regimes. We focus on
the eﬀects of the Stern capacitance and the reaction rate constants through the di-
mensionless parameters, δ, kc and ır, with αc = αa = 1/2. For a ﬁxed voltage, the
mathematical results are valid in the asymptotic limit of thin double layers, ǫ

We can interpret this expression as a decomposition of the cell voltage into the poten-
tial drop across the cathode, bulk, and anode layers respectively. Note the divergence
1, which we expect from our earlier
in the bulk contribution to the cell voltage as ı
analysis. In the next section, we explore analytic solutions for several limiting cases
and compare them to exact solutions given by Eq. (62) with the leading-order cath-
ode and anode diﬀuse layer potential drops determined implicitly by Eqns. (53), (55),
φ1
(56). To make plots in our ﬁgures, we use Newton iteration to solve for φo and v
in this algebraic system.

3.2. Cell Resistance at Low Current . Given the common practice of using
linear circuit models to describe electrochemical systems [27, 28, 20], it is important to
consider the low-current regime, where the cell acts as a simple resistance, R = V /I.
First, we compute the potential drop across the double layers. Since the procedure
is almost identical for the two boundary layers, we focus on the calculation for the
cathode. By writing the boundary conditions Eq. (29) in the standard Butler-Volmer
form involving the exchange current and surface overpotential [26, 1]:

ζo in the formula for the exchange current is determined by combining Eq. (65) with

3.3. Simple Analytical Formulae. The exact leading-order current-voltage
relation simpliﬁes considerably in a variety of physically relevant limits. These ap-
proximate formulae provide insight into the basic physics and may be useful in inter-
pretting experimental data.

3.3.1. The Gouy-Chapman Limit (δ

0). In this limit, the capacitance of
the diﬀuse layer of the charged double layer is negligible compared to the capacitance
of the compact layer. As a result, the voltage drop across the diﬀuse layer accounts
for the entire potential drop across the charged double layer. Physically, this limit
corresponds to the limits of low ionic concentration or zero ionic volume [26]. Since
ζo =

existence of a reaction-limited current when ır < 1. In hindsight, it is obvious that re-
action limited currents exist in the Gouy-Chapman limit because the reaction kinetics
at the anode do not permit a current greater than ır. We emphasize, however, that
the Gouy-Chapman limit is singular because there is no problem achieving current
densities above ır for any δ > 0 (see Figure 2). For any ﬁnite δ > 0, the shift of the
anode double-layer potential drop to the Stern layer helps the dissolution reaction
while suppressing the deposition reaction which permits the current density to rise
greater than ır.

Note that the cathodic and anodic boundary layers do not evenly contribute to the
cell voltage near the limiting currents. In a diﬀusion-limited cell, the cathodic layer

ﬁnite limit. We expect this behavior because as ı
1, the electric ﬁeld only diverges
at x = 0. However, when the cell is reaction-limited, the division of cell voltage
between the boundary layers is reversed as ı approaches the limiting current ır. Even
the voltage drop in the bulk becomes negligible compared to ζ1 in the reaction-limited
case. In this situation, the cell voltage diverges as ı
ır because the only way to
achieve a current near ır is to drastically reduce the deposition reaction at the anode.
In other words, the cation concentration at the anode must be made extremely small
which requires a huge anodic zeta potential.

→

→

3.3.2. The Helmholtz Limit (δ

). This is the reverse of the Gouy-
Chapman limit. Here, the capacitance of the compact layer is negligible, so the
potential drop across the double layer resides completely in the compact layer. The
Helmholtz limit holds for concentrated solutions or solvents with low dielectric con-
stants and other situations where the Debye screening length becomes negligible [26].
It also describes a thick dielectric or insulating layer on an electrode [38, 20].

Moreover, as we shall see in the next section, in limit of fast reactions, both models
lead to the same expression for the cell voltage for ır > 1. On the other hand, when
ır < 1, the two models are qualitatively very diﬀerent. While the Gouy-Chapman
model gives rise to a reaction-limited current, the Helmholtz model does not.

3.3.3. The Fast-Reaction Limit, (ır ≫

ı)αa ) . The
polarographic curves for all δ values collapse onto each other in the limit of fast
reaction kinetics (Figure 3). Even the assumption of symmetry in the electron-transfer
reaction is not required. When reaction rates are much larger than the current, the
two reaction-rate terms in the Butler-Volmer equations, Eqs. (55) and (57), must

Fig. 3. Polarographic curves in the (a) Gouy-Chapman limit and (b) Helmholtz limit as the
reaction rate constants are increased (dashed lines). For these plots, the reaction rate constants
(ır = 1, 2, 5, and10) increase as the curves shift towards the lower right and are related by kc =
ır/2. It should be noted that the fast reaction limit is reached very quickly; in both plots, the curve
closest to the fast reaction curve has a ır value of only 10.

4. Thick Double Layers, ǫ = O(1). Up to this point, we have only examined
the current-voltage characteristics in the singular limit ǫ
0, where the current
density cannot exceed its diﬀusion-limited value, ı = 1. The situation changes changes
for any ﬁnite ǫ > 0.

4.1. What Limiting Current?. As is clearly evident in Figure 4, the cell has
no problem breaking through the classical limiting current for ǫ > 0. Figure 4 also
shows that the ǫ dependence of the polarographic curves only becomes signiﬁcant at
currents approaching the diﬀusion-limited current; below ı
0.5, the curves are nearly
indistinguishable. Moreover, as ǫ increases, upper end of the polarographic curves
ﬂatten out and shift downwards. This decrease in the cell voltage for large ǫ values
arises because the diﬀuse charge layers overlap and are able to interact with each other.
More precisely, the cell has become so small (relative to the Debye screening length)
that the electric ﬁelds from the two diﬀuse layers partially cancel each other out
throughout the cell resulting in a lower total cell voltage. It should be emphasized that
this eﬀect is only observable because we are studying a two electrode system. Single
electrode systems (in addition to being not physically achievable) are not capable of
showing this behavior because they always implicitly assume an inﬁnite system size
which eﬀectively discards any interactions from “far away” electrodes.

Fig. 4. Polarographic curves for ǫ values of 0, 0.0001, 0.001, 0.01, and 0.1 (listed in order
from uppermost to lowest curves) with the other physical parameters taken to be δ = 0, kc = 10,
and ır = 10. Notice that for any ǫ > 0, the cell has no problem achieving current densities higher
than the diﬀusion limited current (dashed vertical line). All of these curves, with the exception of
the exact ǫ = 0 curve, were generated by numerically solving Eq. (24)-(26) subject to the boundary
conditions (27)-(31) using the method of our companion paper[22].

4.2. Breakdown of the Classical Approximation. For a diﬀusion-limited
cell, the classical nonlinear asymptotic analysis just presented leads to an aesthetically
appealing theory that predicts a limiting current at ı = 1. The existence of this
limiting current ﬁts nicely with our physical intuition that the concentration of cations
in a solution must always remain nonnegative. In reality, however, the analysis breaks
down as the current approaches (and exceeds) its limiting value.

The breakdown of the classical asymptotics is evident upon examining the expan-
sions for the bulk ﬁeld variables as the current is increased toward its diﬀusion-limited
value. Calculating a few of the higher order terms in the bulk asymptotic expansion,

Since ¯c(0)

the leading order term at the limiting current. Rubinstein and Shtilman make a
similar observation from a potentiostatic perspective; they note that the asymptotic
expansions are not uniform in the cell voltage [24].

The inconsistency in the classical approximation was apparently ﬁrst noticed by
Levich who observed that the leading-order solution in the bulk predicts an inﬁnite
charge density when the current density reaches 1, which directly contradicts the
assumption of bulk charge neutrality [46]. As ı

which diverges at the cathode.

Smyrl and Newman ﬁrst showed that these paradoxical results are related to
the breakdown of thermal equilibrium charge proﬁles near the cathode, leading to a
signiﬁcant expansion of the double layer into the bulk solution [23]. They argue that
the assumption of electroneutrality breaks down when ¯ρ
¯c. Since ¯c is proportional
to x at the limiting current, the bulk approximation fails to be valid for x smaller
than O(ǫ2/3), which leads to a boundary layer that is thicker than the usual Debye
length. From an alternative perspective, the problems begin when ¯ρ(0)/¯c(0)

(see Figure 5). Using this criterion, we ﬁnd that the classical asymptotic theory is

5. Conclusion. In summary, we have revisited the classical PNP equations,
analyzing for the ﬁrst time the eﬀect of physically realistic boundary conditions for
thin-ﬁlm galvanic cells and other micro-electrochemical systems.
In particular, we
focus on the eﬀect of Stern-layer capacitance and Faradaic reactions with Butler-
Volmer kinetics. Such boundary conditions contain new physics, such as the possibility
of a reaction-limited current due to the slow injection of ions at the anode. We
also ﬁnd that the Stern layer generally allows the cell to exceed limiting currents
by carrying diverging portions of the cell voltage, which would otherwise end up
in the diﬀuse part of the double layer. We have provided analytical formulae for
current-voltage relations that should provide useful in characterizing the diﬀerential
resistance of thin ﬁlms, such as those used in on-chip micro-batteries. Here, we have
focused on the classical nonlinear regime in which thin double layers remain in thermal
equilibrium; the more exotic, non-equilibrium regime, which arises at and above the
classical limiting current, is analyzed in the companion paper [22].

Appendix A. Positivity of Ion Concentrations . The positivity of the ion
concentrations follows directly from the mathematical formulation of the problem. For
the anion concentration, equations (22) can be integrated exactly using the integrating
factor eφ to yield

Clearly, the integral term is postive because eφ is positive everywhere. Moreover, the
reaction boundary condition (29) implies that c+(0) > 0 because both ır and kc are
positive. Thus, we ﬁnd that the cation concentration is strictly positive.

An Analytical Formulation of CPMAS

F. Marica and R. F. Snider
Department of Chemistry, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada, V6T 1Z1
(Dated: February 2, 2008)

An exact expression for the cross polarization between two spin-1/2 particles is derived from the
quantum Liouville equation. This is given in the form of two integrodiﬀerential equations. These
can be solved exactly in the static case (no sample spinning) and a powder average easily performed
numerically. With magic angle spinning, the neglect of certain interference terms simpliﬁes the
numerical calculation. A further assumption decoupling the calculation of the sidebands gives a very
simple formula that is capable of giving a qualitative interpretation of all experimental observations.
Examples are given illustrating typical buildup curves and CPMAS matching proﬁles.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The most frequently used technique to improve the
sensitivity of nuclei with low gyromagnetic ratios and/or
low isotopic abundances in solid-state NMR is the
Hartmann-Hahn cross polarization (CP) in the rotating
frame1. With this technique, polarization can be trans-
ferred from sensitive and often abundant nuclear spins
I (e.g., protons) to the insensitive nuclear spins S (e.g.,
13C, 15N). It is driven by the ﬂip-ﬂop transitions where
both dipolar coupled spins I and S change their mag-
netic quantum number in an energy conserving process.
Since this transfer of polarization takes time to develop,
CP can be observed only if the whole spin system has
reasonably long relaxation times. The CP spin dynamics
has already been discussed more then 25 years ago and
since then has been the subject of a variety of additional
studies. The polarization of the abundant I spins (usu-
ally with a high gyromagnetic ratio) is spin-locked in the
rotating frame by a radiofrequency (rf) ﬁeld. When a
second rf ﬁeld of appropriate magnitude is then simulta-
neously applied to the dipolar coupled rare S spins (usu-
ally with a low gyromagnetic ratio), ﬂip-ﬂop processes
become energy conserving and thus allow the transfer of
polarization from the I spins to the unpolarized S spins.
An overview of the Cross Polarization under Magic Angle
Spinning (CPMAS) can be found in a number of places,
a partial list of which is Refs. 2,3,4,5. The emphasis
in this paper is on an exact theoretical formulation of
CPMAS and no attempt is made to review the experi-
mental methods and/or results that have been achieved
using them.

Several theoretical approaches have been presented for
the description of CPMAS. One such approach is based
on there being a spin temperature, which assumes the
spins are in thermal equilibrium in an appropriate rotat-
ing frame, the recent paper by Meier6 exempliﬁes how
this approach can be used. Another method, due to
M¨uller et al7, resulted in an empirical ﬁtting formula
which has been extensively used by many workers. A
third type of approach is based on the use of ﬂoquet
theory8,9 and a comprehensive program GAMMA has
been written10 which can be used for treating spin dy-
namics and numerically solving the quantum Liouville

equation. A method of describing the spin dynamics
in terms of rotations by parts of the hamiltonian has
been used by Levitt11 and Zhang et al12. Finally, there
are methods that use the Mori13 approach to nonequilib-
rium statistical mechanics. One method is based on pro-
jecting onto selected parts of the hamiltonian14 whereas
another15 uses standard approximation methods for esti-
mating the memory kernel. In contrast to this variety of
methods, the approach presented here utilizes the special
nature of the hamiltonian in the doubly rotating frame,
and the speciﬁc properties of spin-1/2 systems to obtain
an exact integrodiﬀerential equation (correctly a pair of
such equations) for the cross polarization. A solution of
these equations is complicated by any time dependence
of the dipolar coupling, while an exact solution is imme-
diately available for a time independent and orientation
ﬁxed coupling constant. The powder average of the re-
sulting solution can be done numerically.

While the spin temperature approach is very appeal-
ing in that it provides a relatively simple explanation for
the qualitative behaviour of cross polarization, it has a
number of weaknesses. First of all, it is noticed that the
spin system suﬀers no (or at most negligible) relaxation
during a cross polarization experiment. Thus there is
no basis for an equilibrium to be obtained and thus no
basis for assuming a thermal distribution. An argument
might be made for ergodic behaviour but we do not ﬁnd
that appealing. Second, the thermal equilibrium is to be
in the doubly rotating frame, in which the hamiltonian
must still be time dependent if magic angle spinning is
performed. Thus a selection has to be made in some way
to extract a time independent hamiltonian in order to
have a thermal distribution. Exactly how this is done is
arbitrary. Thirdly, only one Hartmann-Hahn matching
condition can be described at a time, after selecting out
the right time independent hamiltonian. The theory pre-
sented here is a purely dynamical theory (no relaxation
is involved), is capable of treating the magic angle spin-
ning exactly (approximations simplifying the calculation
are made, but all time dependence could be included),
and all four peaks of the CPMAS matching proﬁle are
obtained from the same calculation.

The paper starts by reviewing some relevant properties
of spin-1/2 systems together with their rotational prop-
erties. These are used in Sec. III to examine the speciﬁc

nature of the spin hamiltonian in the doubly rotating
frame and thus show that the relevant operator space
for describing cross polarization is only 6 dimensional.
Section IV then derives a formal expression for cross po-
larization, described in terms of two integrodiﬀerential
equations. Section V gives an exact expression for the
static (no spinning) case and exempliﬁes the purely os-
cillatory time dependence for a constant dipolar coupling
strength (ﬁxed direction of the vector joining the parti-
cles containing the spins), and also the destructive inter-
ference eﬀects that occur in a powder sample. Sec. VI
describes the eﬀect of magic angle spinning and a short
discussion ends the paper. Figures illustrating a variety
of diﬀerent behaviors are presented.

II. A SYSTEM OF TWO SPIN-1/2 PARTICLES

The spin operators for the two particles are labelled as
Sx, Sy, Sz and Ix, Iy, Iz. There are also the identities
1S and 1I for the respective spin spaces. As spin-1/2
particles, these operators satisfy the product conditions

SxSy =

Sz,

IxIy =

Iz,

SxSx =

1S,

IxIx =

1I ,

and their cyclic permutations. The ﬁrst set of product
conditions are of course just part of the commutation
relations

[Sx, Sy]− = iSz

[Ix, Iy]− = iIz,

(3)

and their cyclic permutations.
[Throughout this work,
¯h is set equal to 1.] The four operators for each spin
(including the identity) implies a total operator space
of 16 dimensions, which exactly coincides with the di-
mension of a matrix representation of a system of two
spin-1/2 particles. Thus any operator can be expressed
in terms of the sum of products of S and I spin operators.
For simplicity of presentation, the identity operators are
usually not written explicitly. Thus the operator Sz is
understood to stand for the product Sz1I , etc.

Another important property of spin operators (not just
of spin-1/2) is that the commutator of a spin operator
generates a rotation. Setting the commutator superop-
erator

peroperators for the other spin directions can be deﬁned
but are not needed in this work.

III. NATURAL PARTITIONING OF THE
OPERATOR SPACE IN THE
DOUBLY-ROTATING TILTED FRAME

This is phrased in the tilted frame, namely the rf ﬁelds
are labelled as being in the ˆz direction and the spin op-
erators of the truncated (often referred to as the secular
part of the) dipolar hamiltonian lying along the ˆx direc-
tion. Thus the hamiltonian is16

and ω1S =

γI B1I |
|

H(t) = ω1I Iz + ω1SSz + 2b(t)IxSx.

(6)
γSB1S|
The angular velocities ω1I =
|
are proportional to the radio frequency ﬁeld amplitudes
B1I and B1S.
In the laboratory frame, these rf ﬁelds
are oscillating at the respective resonance Zeeman fre-
quencies determined by a large static magnetic ﬁeld in
the ˆx direction. b(t) is the (possibly) time dependent
heteronuclear dipolar coupling strength. Fundamentally
this coupling strength depends on the angle θ between
the vector r pointing from the nucleus having its spin
labelled I to the nucleus whose spin is labelled S relative
to the Zeeman ﬁeld direction ˆx, being explicitly given by

−

1/3),

b(θ) = b0(cos2 θ

(7)
3µ0γI γS¯h/(8πr3) is the dipolar coupling
where b0 =
constant.
Ignoring any internal (rotational or vibra-
tional) motion of the molecules in the chemical system,
a time dependence arises only through the physical spin-
ning of the sample about an axis at the magic angle
[arccos(1/√3)] to the Zeeman ﬁeld (ˆx direction). Thus θ
becomes time dependent and b(t) is written as a short-
hand for b(θ(t)). There is inherently a remaining orien-
tation dependence of b(t), associated with the original
orientation θ(0) of r. In a powder sample there is a ran-
dom distribution of such angles so an average over θ(0)
needs to be made for such samples. But for the analysis
of the spin dynamics, only the possible time dependence
of b(t) is important, so only this time dependence is ex-
plicitly displayed. Later on, when a powder sample is
considered, the extra averaging over initial orientations
(or its equivalent) is made.

It is also noted that, if b is time independent (and has
a ﬁxed interspin orientation, θ), the energy eigenvalues

of this hamiltonian are
(1/2)
eigenvalues have been noted (at least) by Levitt, et al16,
but their method of solving the spin dynamics, as do
some other treatments, for example11,12,17, is based on a
separation of the hamiltonian, Eq. (6), into two commut-
ing parts. Neither the eigenvalues, nor their respective
eigenvectors, seem to be standardly quoted in the liter-
ature. They are listed for reference in Appendix A. The
method used in this paper does not explicitly use these
eigenvalue properties nor the above noted separation of
the hamiltonian into commuting parts.

The purpose of this section is to catalog how the 16
spin operators behave under the action of the commuta-
tor superoperator

(t) for the hamiltonian,

L
[H(t), A]− =

(t)A

L

≡

Lrf A +

Ld(t)A.

(8)

This is listed as a sum of radio frequency and dipolar
parts. It is to be shown that this set of operators is par-
titioned into four dynamically separate sets of operators.
Crucial to this partitioning is the vanishing of commuta-
tors of the form

[SxIx, SyIy]− = Sx[Ix, SyIy]− + [Sx, SyIy]−Ix

= SxSy(iIz) + iSzIyIx
= (i/2)Sz(iIz) + iSz(

i/2)Iz = 0. (9)

−

This relation is special to spin-1/2 systems since it de-
pends on the special product conditions, Eq. (1), of the
spin-1/2 operators.

Starting with the operator Iz, the action of

(t) on

successively appearing operators is

The possible time dependence of
and b has not been
indicated in these equations. This gives a closed set of
6 operators, namely Iz, Sz, SxIx, SxIy, SyIx and SyIy. It
is this set of operators that govern the behaviour of a
CPMAS experiment. The set of commutators (10) have
some special properties which are useful for the subse-
quent analysis. Speciﬁcally it is noticed that the dipolar
hamiltonian acts only to couple the single 1-spin oper-
ators Sz and Iz to the product spin operators, whereas
the rf operators act only on the product spin operators.
Another closed set consists of the identity 1S1I as its
sole member, since this operator is unchanged by
. So
it is a set all by its own. The same is true for the product
operator SzIz since it commutes with both rf operators
and, because of the commutator type of Eq. (9), it also
commutes with the truncated dipolar operator. Finally
there are the remaining 8 operators, which can easily
be shown to be all dynamically coupled, so there is no
further partitioning of the spin space.

L

Since the 16 operators span the operator space, any op-
erator, and in particular the density operator ρ, can be
expressed as a linear combination of these operators18.
For the CPMAS set of operators, the relevant space con-
sists only of 6 operators plus the identity, the latter being
retained in order that the density operator be normalized,
namely that the trace over both spins (a total of four
Dirac states) is consistent with Trρ = 1. Of these opera-
tors, only the identity has a ﬁnite trace, so ρ must have
(1/4)1S1I as one of its terms. Recognizing the expansion
coeﬃcients as proportional to the corresponding expec-
tation values, the CPMAS density operator can thus be
expressed as

ρ = (1/4)1S1I + Szh

Thus the study of the evolution of the density operator is
equivalent to the study of the evolution of the expectation
values of these observables.

.(11)

It is appropriate to subdivide this set of operators fur-
ther, namely into the set of 1-spin operators Sz and Iz,
plus the identity to preserve normalization, and the re-
maining set of 2-spin operators. Appropriate for this
subdivision, a projection superoperator
is deﬁned that
selects out the 1-spin part of the operator space, thus

= (1/4)1S1ITr + SzTrSz + IzTrIz,

is due solely to the dipolar hamiltonian. The retention
of one projector in each of the subspace coupling cases
serves to select which space is to be acted upon and which
is to be mapped into. Again it is emphasized that any
time dependence of the dipolar coupling strength has no
eﬀect on this separation of the diﬀerent parts of

After a 90◦ pulse to align the I-spin along the ˆz axis
(doubly rotating tilted frame), the time evolution of the
expectation value
of the S-spin is monitored exper-
imentally. Thus the calculation is to use the value of
(0) as the only nonzero spin expectation value as the

initial condition and to calculate the consequent time de-
pendence of
(t). Since it is the expectation values
of Sz and Iz that are of importance, it is the partition
consisting of these two operators that is relevant for the
analysis of these experiments. The projection superop-
deﬁned above carries out this selection.

it is a set of 6 coupled equations that must be solved
in order to predict the time evolution of

only the Sz and Iz part of the operator space reﬂects the
experimentally observed quantities, a separation of the
dynamics to emphasize these can be useful. The gener-
alized master equation19 approach does this in a natural

A. Derivation of the generalized master equation

The derivation of the generalized master equation is
reviewed in its generality since there is no immediate sim-
pliﬁcation of the derivation by specializing the superop-
erators to the present case. Note that a time dependence
of
(t) is allowed for here, which is standardly not con-

sidered.

integral over the time history (memory) of the relevant
observables.

B. Application of the generalized master equation

For a cross polarization experiment involving spin-1/2
particles, the special properties, (13), of the Liouville su-
peroperator allows all projection superoperators to be
dropped in the generalized master equation for ρ1(t).
Moreover, the initial condition on the density operator

ρ(0) = ρ1(0) = (1/4)1S1I + Izh

lies entirely in the relevant space, so the generalized mas-

It is thus shown that the calculation of the cross polar-
ization separates into two independent parts. This com-
pletes the part of the calculation which involves the spin
operators, the remaining part of the calculation requires
solving the two integrodiﬀerential equations. In order to
carry this out, it is necessary to specify the detailed time
dependence of the dipolar coupling strength b(t). The
static [b(t) time independent] and magic angle spinning
cases are discussed in turn.

V. STATIC CROSS POLARIZATION

In the static case, the dipolar coupling strength b is
time independent, but still depends on the angle θ of the
vector r separating the S and I spin particles and the
direction (ˆx) of the static magnetic ﬁeld.

Thus it is seen that, for a constant b (speciﬁc orientation

between oscillating terms. Actually, since ω1S and ω1I

dotted line for the value of b(θ = 0) = 20/3 kHz contributing
to the curve for the powder.

and the width at 1/2 height.

a consequence, the amplitude b2/(b2 + Σ2) of the sum
frequency contribution is smaller than the amplitude of
the diﬀerence frequency contribution, implying that the
rapid oscillations of the sum frequency are likely lost as
noise on top of the slower oscillations of the diﬀerence
frequency.

Equation (38) has been obtained by Levitt11 and
Zhang et al12 by using a sequence of rotations using ef-
fective spin operators based on a decomposition of the
hamiltonian into two commuting parts.

Experimentally, the matching proﬁle is obtained by
scanning the rf amplitude of the S-spin channel and the

VI. CROSS POLARIZATION WITH MAGIC
ANGLE SPINNING

The orientation of the vector r connecting the posi-
tions of the two spins is made time dependent by rota-
tion about an axis ˆn at a frequency of ωr. For magic
angle spinning, the angle between the rotation axis ˆn
and the direction ˆx of the static magnetic (Zeeman) ﬁeld
is arccos(1/√3). At that angle the dipolar angle depen-
dence is split into four time dependent parts, rather than
the ﬁve parts for a general splitting of the order 2 spher-
ical harmonics. Explicitly this time dependence is given
by

b(t) = b∗

2e−2iωrt + b∗

are proportional to the spherical harmonics Y21(θr, φr)
and Y22(θr, φr), expressed in terms of the angles θr, φr
deﬁning the direction between the particles containing
the spins with respect to the axis of rotation ˆn. A short
discussion of how this splitting arises is given in Appendix
B.

A. General formulation for magic angle spinning

The dipolar coupling strength b(t) enters into the inte-
grodiﬀerential equations (27-28) for the cross polarization
in the form of the product b(t)b(t′). From the explicit
time dependence given by Eq. (41), the product has a

total of 16 diﬀerent terms. Four of these are naturally
combined into two simple forms involving the time dif-
t′, while the remainder have a variety of time
ference t
dependences. In detail, the combination of time depen-
dences is

In the following it is assumed that only the terms involving the time diﬀerence t

Eq. (45) is required. This can be accomplished as in the
static CP situation by using successive derivatives of Eq.
(45), see Sec. V. But it is necessary to go up to the ninth
derivative of D(t) before a suﬃcient number of terms are
obtained in order to eliminate the Nn(t)’s. This calcula-
tion is described in Appendix C while an approximation
is made in the following subsection that provides a sim-
ple analytical estimation of the cross polarization with
magic angle spinning.

B.

Independent Sideband Approximation

The idea here is that, near a Hartmann-Hahn matching
condition, only one of the Nn(t)’s is of importance, that
is, of appreciable magnitude. As a consequence, D(t)
can be considered as a sum of four terms, each of which
is determined by a separate equation. With a similar
approximation for the Σ based G(t)
(t), the
total cross polarization is described as a sum of eight
terms.

Sz + Izi

≡ h

To implement this idea, D(t) is written as the sum

D(t) = D−2(t) + D−1(t) + D1(t) + D2(t),

(47)

each term of which is to be approximated as the solution
of

A decoupling of Eq. (45) has thus been accomplished.
Since the equation for Dn(t) has the same structure as
that of Eq. (29), so its solution is, according to Eq. (35),

Dn(t) =

(∆ + nωr)2 +

(50)

On the basis that only one Dn(t) has a signiﬁcant con-
tribution when near a matching condition, it has been
assumed that Dn(0) is well estimated by D(0). Adding
in the corresponding approximation for
(t) and
Sz + Izi

doing some minor algebra, the complete time dependence
(t) is estimated by the sum of eight terms

A powder average of this result is easily calculated since

ing proﬁle.

Figures 3 and 4 illustrate the typical matching pro-
ﬁles that can be attained. Figure 3 exempliﬁes what
is standardly observed in an experiment, namely four
peaks at the shifted Hartmann-Hahn matching condi-
tions ω1S = ω1I + nωr for n=-2,-1,1 and 2. These are
due to the set of ﬁrst terms in the sum of Eq.
(51)
[with the cosine term dropped to reﬂect the time aver-
age], associated with the conditions ∆ + nωr = 0.
In
such a situation the second set of terms is small because
2ωr < 0
∆+ nωr. But if 2ωr > ω1I then ω1I −
Σ+ nωr ≫
and the matching condition ∆ + 2ωr requires a negative
ω1S. This is not experimentally possible (ω1S measures
the strength of an rf ﬁeld) so this matching condition
cannot be attained and the peak in the matching proﬁle
is absent. However, in this case, one of the second set
of terms in Eq. (51) can have a small denominator, so a
peak in the matching proﬁle arises from that term. This
gives a negative
(t) so the peak is negative. Figure
4 illustrates this case. The structure is emphasized by
choosing a small ω1I while a large ωr is needed to allow
the matching condition ω1S = 2ωr −
ω1I to be attained
for positive ω1S. Meier6 has a ﬁgure of experimental data
illustrating this kind of behavior, but for the 3-spin sys-
tem CH2. An even more interesting proﬁle, which does
not seem to have yet been observed experimentally, is
when ω1I is even smaller, so that two matching condi-
tions are from the second term, namely Σ
2ωr = 0 and
ωr = 0, while the other two matching conditions are
Σ
2ωr. The result is a matching proﬁle
ωr = 0 and ∆

with two negative and two positive peaks. This is illus-
trated by the second proﬁle shown in Fig. 4. It is clear
that there can be at most only two negative peaks in a

VII. DISCUSSION

The special properties of spin-1/2 systems and the spe-
cial nature of the hamiltonian, Eq. (6), have been used
to give a formally exact method of calculating the cross
polarization buildup curves and matching proﬁles for an
isolated pair of spins. For the static case (no sample spin-
ning), this can be expressed in closed form, Eq. (38), if
the interspin direction is ﬁxed, while a powder average
can be easily calculated numerically, Eq.
(40). These
results have also been obtained by Levitt11 and Zhang
et al12 using a sequence of rotations based on a partic-
ular division of the hamiltonian into commuting parts.
It is of note that the time dependence of the cross po-
larization is purely oscillatory if a single orientation of
the dipolar coupling strength is involved. It is the sen-
sitive dependence of the frequency of this oscillation on
the orientation, which causes an enormous destructive in-
terference in a powder sample. The decay-like nature of
the envelope of the oscillations in a powder sample, see
Fig. 1, arises from this destructive interference rather
than from any spin relaxation (or spin diﬀusion), which
of course is not included in the hamiltonian dynamics of
an isolated system.

Magic angle spinning is formally easy to include, it is
just a case of recognizing the correct time dependence of
the dipolar coupling strengths in the integrodiﬀerential
equations (27) and (28). But how to obtain a general so-
lution of these equations is not clear. Two simplifying ap-
proximations have been made. First, only those terms in
the product of the dipolar coupling strengths, Eq. (44),
are kept that depend on the time diﬀerence. It is assumed
that the other time dependences lead to minor interfer-
ence eﬀects but that has not been explored. A method
of solving the equations with the above single approxi-
mation is given in Appendix C, and been explored with

(cid:3)
(cid:3)
(cid:3)
(cid:3)

some calculations. The results found, which are not pre-
sented here, indicate that the solutions are qualitatively
in agreement with those using the further approximation
of Sec. VI B. This second approximation assumes that
only one term in Eq. (45) is of importance in a range
of ω1S values. An analytic expression, Eq. (51), for the
cross polarization is then obtained for ﬁxed interspin ori-
entation, and it is in a form in which a powder average
can easily be carried out numerically.
Its form is very
simple and it is immediately seen how the cross polariza-
tion is signiﬁcant when the standard matching conditions
∆ + nωr = 0 are met. It is also seen that there is another
set of matching conditions, Σ + nωr = 0 which can lead
to an enhancement of the cross polarization, but now
with
(0) having opposite signs. There can
be at most two negative peaks in the matching proﬁle,
but there are always four physically possible matching
conditions for a given ω1I and ωr.

and

The method presented here, with the approximations,
has the advantage that the qualitative behavior of ex-
perimental buildup curves and matching proﬁles can be
given simple explanations. The quantitative connection
between the dipolar coupling strength and the size and
width of the matching proﬁles, and the oscillatory nature
of the buildup curves is formally available. How well that
can be done experimentally can also depend on the real
physical system. The spin pair is never truly isolated,
so small interactions can cause some more interference
eﬀects, and the surroundings aﬀord relaxation. Such ef-
fects can surely inﬂuence the shape of the buildup curves,
contributing to a more rapid closure of the envelope of
the oscillations as time progresses. It would also aﬀect
the height of the matching proﬁle peaks, but hopefully
not perturb too much the position of the peaks.

It is interesting that the thermodynamic method can
give the same formulas for the ∆-based peaks in the
matching proﬁle as the independent sideband approxima-
tion, provided an ωr-dependent transformation is used
to get a time independent rotating frame hamiltonian.
However, this must be done one peak at a time whereas
the present method gives all four peaks predicted by the
same formalism and there is no question about any fur-
ther frame transformation.

Of the previously introduced methods that we are
aware of for interpreting cross polarization, the one used
by Levitt11 and Zhang et al12 seems the closest to being
fundamentally based. But it does not seem to have been
extended to include the magic angle spinning case.
It
is also not clear to us how that might be incorporated
into their formalism. We see the formula introduced by
M¨uller7, and extensively used for ﬁtting experimental
buildup curves, as a very useful ﬁtting tool. But since
it inherently has exponential decays built into it, care
should be taken when interpreting the parameters found
in terms of physical quantities, since no relaxation is fun-
damental to the explanation of the buildup curves. We
hasten to add that, as we indicated above, in a real sys-
tem the spins are not truly isolated so relaxation eﬀects

9

are present and these can inﬂuence the detailed shapes
of the experimental curves, but not their fundamental
behavior.

A vector based derivation is given for the eﬀect of spinning the orientation dependent dipolar coupling strength.
The rotation of any unit vector ˆr about an axis ˆn by an angle χ produces the rotated vector

where b1 and b2 are given explicitly in Eqs. (42) and (43).

It is noted that the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of these parts of the coupling strengths, when averaged

over all angles, preserves the total square of the coupling strength, namely

APPENDIX C: COMPLETE SIDEBAND
CALCULATION

This appendix gives a method for carrying out the ex-
act calculation of D(t) from Eq. (45). For this purpose,

the second derivative of Nn(t) is

Then the third derivative of D(t) can be expressed in
terms of the ﬁrst derivative and the Nn(t)’s, that is

as the sum

(∆+nωn)2Nn(t). (C2)

Continuing in this way, the higher odd-ordered deriva-
tives of D(t) can be calculated in terms of lower ordered
derivatives and the Nn(t)’s. The ﬁrst 4 equations ob-
tained in this way (up to the 7th order derivative) can
be used to solve for the Nn(t)’s in terms of the deriva-
tives of D(t). Substituting these into the equation for the
9th order derivative produces a diﬀerential equation for
D(t) of 9th order, but with constant coeﬃcients. Such an
equation has 9 solutions of the form D(t) = eλt, whose
proper combination gives the time dependence of D(t).
To simplify this calculation, it is convenient to intro-
duce the notation D(m)(t) for the mth derivative of D(t),
and the sums

A formal inversion of the matrix of frequency powers
multiplying the Nn(t)’s from the 4 odd-ordered deriva-
tives D(1)(t) to D(7)(t) allows the Nn(t)’s to be expressed
in terms of the D(m)(t)’s. Substitution into the D(9)(t)
equation gives the desired diﬀerential equation for D(t).
This involves only odd-ordered derivatives of D(t). If eλt
is substituted in for D(t), this gives a fourth order poly-
nomial in λ2 times a factor of λ. The polynomial has 4
roots which must be negative since the spin dynamics is
governed by the quantum Liouville equation (and thus
the spin system must oscillate without any relaxation),
and there is also the zero root from the multiplicative
factor of λ. The 4 eigenfrequencies Ωm (square roots of
minus the polynomial roots) and the zero frequency de-
termine the time dependence of D(t). A further simpliﬁ-
cation arises from noticing that Nn(0) = 0, which implies
that all odd derivatives of D(t) vanish at t = 0. Thus
D(t) must be an even function of t and can be expressed

The coeﬃcients Am are determined from the even-

Abstract

→

The temperature dependence of the rate of the reaction CH4+H
CH3+H2 is
studied using classical collision theory with a temperature-dependent eﬀective
potential derived from a path integral analysis. Analytical expressions are ob-
tained for the eﬀective potential and for the rate constant. The rate constant
expressions use a temperature-dependent activation energy. They give better
agreement with the available experimental results than do previous empirical
ﬁts. Since all but one of the parameters in the present expressions are ob-
tained from theory, rather than by ﬁtting to experimental reaction rates, the
expressions can be expected to be more dependable than purely empirical ex-
pressions at temperatures above 2000 K or below 350 K, where experimental
results are not available.

I. INTRODUCTION

−

The validity of the Arrhenius expression for the rate constant of a bimolecular reaction,
Ea/RT ), where Ea is the activation energy and R is the gas constant, has long
k = A exp(
been the subject of controversy [1]. Ea is generally assumed to be independent of temper-
ature, and any deviation from linear behavior in the plot of log k vs. 1/T is attributed
to temperature dependence in A. Classical collision theory [2] suggests only a weak tem-
T 1/2, while theoretical
perature dependence of the preexponential factor, of the form A
arguments based on transition-state theory (TST) with corrections for quantum mechanical
tunneling [1,3] can predict a signiﬁcantly diﬀerent dependence.

There exists an extensive literature of theoretical and experimental studies [4–14] for this
reaction on account of its importance as an elementary reaction in hydrocarbon pyrolysis.
The experimental results span the temperature range from 372 K up to almost 2000 K.
TST studies [4–10] have predicted a distinct upward curvature in the Arrhenius plot, and
an analysis by Shaw [5] of experimental results through the year 1978 generally supported
this prediction. Subsequently, Sepehrad et al. [12] concluded that in fact a linear Arrhenius
plot was more consistent with the data, after omitting some apparently unreliable earlier
results and adding new results of their own. More recent analyses by Baulch et al. [13] and
by Rabinowitz et al. [14] discerned curvature with A

T 2.11, respectively.

T 3 and A

We propose an alternative theoretical approach to this problem, based not on transition-
state theory but on classical collision theory with a temperature-dependent eﬀective potential
energy function. This approach is based on a path-integral analysis developed by Feynman
[15,16] for problems in quantum statistical mechanics. He noted that the equation for the
statistical density matrix is formally identical to that for the kernel that expresses the time
dependence of the wavefunction of a quantum mechanical particle over a time interval that
is taken to be negative and imaginary. Thus, calculations in statistical mechanics can be
carried out using the path integral techniques of quantum dynamics. This idea can be used
to derive an eﬀective potential Veﬀ for the chemical reaction such that a classical mechanical
calculation of the reaction rate with the eﬀective potential is approximately equivalent to
a quantum mechanical treatment using the actual potential V [17]. This simple approach
was used previously to describe the diﬀusion of H on a Cu surface [18], and the results were
later found to agree with those from an elaborate reaction-path variational TST calculation
with semiclassical adiabatic tunneling corrections [19].

The path integral analysis transforms V into a temperature-dependent function Veﬀ(T ),
from which we obtain a temperature-dependent activation energy. Thus, our model for the
chemical reaction is classical collision theory but with a temperature-dependent Ea. We
will include no temperature dependence in A other than the classical T 1/2 factor. We will
introduce a slight modiﬁcation into the analysis so that the path-integral result, which is
derived as a perturbation theory about the high-T limit, can be smoothly interpolated to
the correct low-T result. For V we will use the empirical hydrocarbon potential of Brenner
[20], which is constructed from Morse-type functions with modiﬁcations to take into account
non-local eﬀects.

II. METHOD

To calculate the partition function from the statistical density matrix it is suﬃcient to
consider only paths that return to their starting point. The path integrals that need to be
evaluated are very diﬃcult on account of the large number of degrees of freedom needed to
describe the many possible paths. However, if ¯h/kBT is small, where kB is the Boltzmann
constant, then one can derive a simple approximate expression for the partition function,
[15,16],

where β = 1/kBT and

The signiﬁcance of this result is the fact that Eq. (2) has exactly the form of the classical
partition function except that V is replaced by the eﬀective potential Veﬀ, which is just a
Gaussian average of V with a temperature-dependent standard deviation σ. Equation (2)
is for a system with only one degree of freedom, but the extension to an arbitrary number
of degrees of freedom is straightforward.

It has been suggested [17] that classical dynamics on the potential Veﬀ could be used
to simulate quantum dynamics on the true potential V . This would not be valid for the
dynamics of a single particle, but it is a reasonable hypothesis for a statistical ensemble of
particles as in a molecular dynamics simulation of a chemical reaction. In fact, it can be
shown [17] that when Veﬀ is used in place of V in TST one obtains the standard Wigner
tunneling correction.

This approach provides an appealing qualitative model for quantum eﬀects. At a mini-
mum of V , averaging over neighboring points according to Eq. (3) will increase the potential.
This accounts for the fact that the minimum of V is in practice inaccessible to the system
on account of the impossibility of localizing a quantum mechanical particle. In eﬀect, the
averaging provides a zero-point energy correction. At a maximum, the averaging reduces V .
In eﬀect, this is a tunneling correction. At a saddle point of V , averaging over a given coor-
dinate will reduce the potential if V ′′ is negative and increase it if V ′′ is positive. Elsewhere,
V can be approximated as a linear function, in which case the averaging in Eq. (3) will
have little eﬀect. At high T the quantum eﬀects will be small, because if the average kinetic
energy is large then it is only rarely that a particle will be close enough to the potential
surface to sense the diﬀerence between V and Veﬀ. Accordingly, the standard deviation given
by Eq. (4) goes to zero in the limit of inﬁnite T .

At low T the approximations used to derive Eq. (3) can be expected to lead to a signiﬁcant
error, since the system will spend much of its time in the quantum regions of V . However, a
minor modiﬁcation of the theory will ensure that it give the correct low-temperature limit.

3

At T = 0 K the system will be at rest at the nearest local minimum of V . The energy of
the system will be the value of V plus a zero-point energy correction. A minimum of V in
principle corresponds to a stable chemical species, for which the zero-point energy can be
determined empirically from analysis of the vibrational spectrum. Thus, we can replace T
in Eq. (4) with

Teﬀ = T + T0,

where T0 is a constant chosen such that Eq. (3) reproduces the empirical zero-point energy
of a known species.

Now consider the application of this theory to the hydrogen abstraction reaction, Eq. (1).
We will treat this as a problem in two degrees of freedom (x, y), where x is the C—H
distance for the reacting hydrogen and y is the H—H distance for the reacting hydrogen.
We will assume that the C—H—H conﬁguration is linear along the reaction path. The
angle θ between the reactive and nonreactive C—H bonds will be treated as a quadratic
polynomial in x that interpolates between 109.5◦ for CH4, 120◦ for CH3, and the transition-
state geometry of 102.4◦ at x = 1.08 ˚A [7]. Then,

Note that the mass in Eq. (3) has been replaced by the reduced mass µx = mH(1+mH/mC)−1
or µy = mH/2.

For V (x, y) we use Brenner’s potential I [20], which is a sum of two-body interactions

V (x, y) = VCH(x, y) + VHH(y, x).

by the functions fi and Bi. fi(r) is a cutoﬀ function that smoothly interpolates to zero in the
limit of large r. Bi(r, q) is a rather complicated function that models the eﬀects of nearby
atoms on the primary interaction. For given (x, y) Eq. (6) can be evaluated by numerical
quadrature. The values

There is a minor inconsistency in using this procedure with the Brenner potential. For
the C—H well depth Brenner simply used the bond energy of the CH molecule without
subtracting the zero-point energy. Thus, we are in a sense adding zero-point energy to a
potential that already includes it. This will make the calculated activation energy smaller
than it ought to be. We will assume that any errors from this procedure will be insigniﬁcant,
since the quantum eﬀects for C—H interactions are much smaller than those for H—H
interactions. However, in principle, one ought to reﬁt the potential using the correct well
depth. For the H—H potential, which causes most of the quantum eﬀects, Brenner did use
the correct well depth for H2.

We ﬁnd that it is possible to accurately approximate Veﬀ with an analytic expression.

We obtain a temperature-dependent activation energy as the diﬀerence between Veﬀ
evaluated at the CH5 saddle point and at the reactants well. In Fig. 1 the solid curve shows
our quantum mechanical result for Ea, calculated from the Gaussian average with standard
deviations σi in terms of eﬀective temperatures according to Eqs. (7). This result is in eﬀect
an interpolation between the high-temperature path integral analysis and the empirical low-
temperature limit. For T > 300 K we ﬁnd that Ea can be accurately ﬁt with a quadratic
polynomial in T −1,

The dashed curve shows the result of a purely high-temperature analysis, with the σi in terms
of the actual temperature. The two results are in general agreement down to approximately
600 K. (The unsteadiness in the curves at low T is due to uncertainty in the determination
of the geometry of the activated complex.)

The corresponding Arrhenius curves are shown in Fig. 2, where they are compared with
classical collision theory (the dotted curve, corresponding to a temperature-independent
activation energy equal to limT →∞ Ea(T ) ), with a recent multidimensional semiclassical
variational TST analysis [10] (the dash-dot curve), and with experimentally determined
reaction rates [5,12,14]. Our theoretical treatment yields the activation energy, but not the
Arrhenius prefactor, which must be ﬁt to the experimental results. The theory for the T
dependence of Ea is exact in the high-temperature limit. Therefore, it is best to consider
only high-temperature rate constants for the purpose of determining the prefactor. We will
assume that the measurements by Rabinowitz et al. [14], from the recent Brookhaven ﬂash
photolysis-shock tube study, are the most reliable of the high temperature results. Fitting
the classical collision theory expression

k = A0T 1/2e−Ea/RT

(26)

to the the Brookhaven results, with our theoretical formula for the function Ea(T ), gives
log10(A0 / cm3s−1) =
11.536. It is clear from Fig. 2 that the Gaussian average with Teﬀ is
in better agreement with the low temperature measurements than are the Gaussian average
with the actual T or the classical theory with Ea independent of temperature.

IV. DISCUSSION

A. Comparison with transition-state theory

It can be seen in Fig. 2 that our theory (the Gaussian average with Teﬀ) and Truong’s
TST [10] both predict a distinct upward curvature in the Arrhenius plot at low temperature.
They disagree at high temperature, with our analysis predicting a slower reaction rate than
that predicted by the TST study.

Our theoretical approach diﬀers from TST in the way in which we describe the classical
dynamics and in the way we include quantum eﬀects. In TST the expression for the rate
constant can be expressed approximately in the form k = a0T xΓe−Ea/RT , where a0 and
x are temperature-independent constants and Γ(T ) is a quantum correction [3,4]. The
reactants and the transition state are assumed to be in equilibrium, and the factor T x comes
from the resulting equilibrium constant, expressed as a ratio of partition functions. For
CH4+H ⇀↽ CH5 the value of x is 3/2. Thus, we can express the TST result in the form
k = a0T 3/2e−Ea/RT ,

(27)

with Ea equal to a constant for classical TST and Ea(T ) = E(cl)
ln (Γ(T )) for quantum TST.
Our approach is to use collision theory for the classical dynamics, which gives x = 1/2,

a

7

and to determine Ea(T ) directly from the temperature-dependent eﬀective potential instead
using one of the standard semiclassical expressions for Γ(T ). However, we could just as well
have used the eﬀective-potential values for Ea in Eq. (27) instead of using the collision-theory
expression Eq. (26).

A clearer comparison of theory and experiment is given by Fig. 3, which shows the
diﬀerence between log10 k and log10 kcl, where kcl is the rate constant predicted by classical
theory. We obtain kcl from Eq. (26) by setting Ea = 12.07 kcal/mol, which is the value
given by the Brenner potential. We use the same value of A0 as with the T -dependent
Ea, since the quantum and classical theories have the same high-T limit. The solid curve
in Fig. 3 corresponds to our quantum collision theory, using Eq. (26) with the eﬀective-
potential Ea(T ) and with Teﬀ in the standard deviations for the Gaussian averaging. The
dotted curve results from using this same Ea(T ) in the TST expression Eq. (27). The solid
curve is clearly in better agreement with the experimental points.

Figure 3 also shows Truong’s variational TST results [10] (the dash-dot curve), which
were based on ab initio calculations of the potential, and it shows results from a varia-
tional TST study by Joseph et al. [8] (the dash-dot-dot curve), which used an analytical
semiempirical potential energy function. The prefactor a0 used for our eﬀective-potential
TST was chosen to give agreement with the high-temperature experimental results. Note,
however, that diﬀerent values of a0 would lead to qualitative agreement between the eﬀective-
potential TST and the variational TST studies. Although there is a fair amount of scatter
in the experimental results, our quantum collision theory and the TST studies appear to
agree equally well with the low-temperature experimental points, where quantum eﬀects are
expected to be most important. This is consistent with previous studies for other systems
[17,19], which showed agreement between quantum eﬀects calculated from semiclassical TST
quantum corrections and those calculated from eﬀective potentials.

At high temperatures the results from Truong’s TST results lie above most of the experi-
mental points. The results from semiempirical TST are in better agreement with experiment,
but extrapolation of them to higher T would give a larger rate constant than does our col-
lision theory. Since barrier recrossing becomes more likely at higher T , one can expect that
TST will increasingly overestimate the reaction rate as T increases. Truong used an ab initio
result for the barrier height (16.3 kcal/mol) that was higher than the value used by Joseph
et al. (12.9 kcal/mol) or the value used by us (12.07 kcal/mol). However, as T increases,
the value used for Ea becomes less signiﬁcant than the value used for the exponent x. At
high T the assumption on which collision theory is based, that only the translational degrees
of freedom of the colliding molecules need to be taken into account, is reasonable since the
lifetime of the activated complex will typically be too short for there to be signiﬁcant con-
version of translational energy into vibrational or rotational energy before it breaks apart.
At lower temperature TST will be more accurate than collision theory, but the error intro-
duced by using x = 1/2 will become relatively less important than errors in the value of Ea.
The excellent agreement with experiment from our quantum collision theory would seem to
indicate that this is what happens for the particular reaction considered here. In any case,
the approach we have presented for calculating quantum eﬀects can be used with TST as
well as with collision theory, and it is conceivable that for other reactions, at intermediate
temperatures, TST might be the more appropriate choice.

B. Comparison of analytical expressions for the rate constant

In Fig. 4 we compare our calculated results with various “best ﬁts” of the experimental
points [5,12–14]. The ﬁtting functions are given in Table 1. For Fig. 4 we computed our
rate constants using analytic expresions for Ea(T ). The solid curve was computed using
the quadratic ﬁtting function in Eq. (25). This curve is almost indistinguishable from the
corresponding curve in Fig. 3, which was computed from our actual values for the Ea. The
dashed curve results from a linear ﬁt for Ea(T ), which yields an expression for k that has
only 3 parameters. Most of the empirical ﬁts in Fig. 4 are also 3-parameter expressions.

Our results in Fig. 4 are in better agreement with the experimental points than are any
of the empirical expressions. The expressions of Shaw [5] and of Baulch et al. [13] (the dash-
dot and dash-dot-dot curves, respectively) seem to be too low in the low-T region. Both
of these ﬁts were carried out before the data from the high-T measurements by Rabinowitz
et al. [14] were available. Shaw’s ﬁt agrees with these new data while the ﬁt by Baulch et
al. appears to be too high in the high-T region. Not surprisingly, the ﬁt by Rabinowitz
et al. (the dash-dot-dot-dot curve) seems accurate at high-T . However, it appears to be
too high at low T . Note that only one of our parameters (the prefactor A0) is ﬁt to the
experimental results. The remaining parameters are calculated theoretically. (Of course,
other experimental results, such as the bond dissociation energies of CH4 and H2, enter our
theory indirectly since we based our calculations on an empirical potential function [20].)

The most signiﬁcant diﬀerence between our expressions for k and the various ﬁts is
the behavior that is predicted at very high T , above 2000 K. Our expressions predict a
signiﬁcantly lower reaction rate in this region than do any of the others. Unfortunately,
there are no available experimental results above 2000 K with which to compare. The
quantum eﬀects at very high T are insigniﬁcant. Therefore, the accuracy of our results in
that region depends only on the accuracy of the activation energy given by the Brenner
potential and on the accuracy of the Arrhenius expression from classical collision theory.

C. Conclusions

We have shown that the Arrhenius expression from classical collision theory with Ea
expressed as a polynomial in 1/T gives agreement with the experimental measurements
for the rate constant for CH4+H that is at least as good as that from ﬁts that include T
dependence in the prefactor. This is especially striking since only one of the parameters in
our expressions is determined by ﬁtting to the experimental points. The fact that the other
parameters are determined theoretically suggests that our expressions are more likely to be
dependable at temperatures above 2000 K or below 350 K, where experimental results are
unavailable.

These calculations require that the potential energy surface be known. Otherwise, there
is no choice but to choose a functional form for k(T ) containing parameters that are all
determined by ﬁtting to measured reaction rates. Traditionally, an Arrhenius expression is
used with the temperature dependence in the prefactor. However, the theory developed here
provides a justiﬁcation for choosing a functional form with temperature dependence in the
activation energy.

The success of our theory at describing this reaction rate over a wide temperature range
has two important implications for molecular dynamics simulations of chemical reactions.
First, it supports the use [23] of the Brenner hydrocarbon potential in those studies. This is
an empirical potential, parameterized to a data set consisting of properties of stable chemical
species, yet it seems to be able to accurately model the unstable CH5 transition state, since
the curvature of the Arrhenius plot depends sensitively on the topography of the potential
in the vicinity of the saddle point.

The second implication is that it is possible to use a classical molecular dynamics compu-
tation, with a Gaussian-averaged eﬀective potential, to model processes in which quantum
eﬀects are important. The evaluation of the potential function is the most time-consuming
step in these computations. Therefore, the use of numerical quadrature to perform the
Gaussian averaging would be impractical. However, the use of our analytic approximation,
given by Eqs. (12) through (24), will have only a minor eﬀect on the computational cost.

FIGURES

FIG. 1. Temperature dependence of the activation energy. The dotted line shows the classical,
temperature-independent, result. The dashed curve was calculated from the Gaussian-averaged
potential using the standard deviations given by Eq. (4). The solid curve was calculated from the
Gaussian-averaged potential with T in Eq. (4) replaced by Teﬀ according to Eqs. (7) and (10).

FIG. 2. Arrhenius plot of rate constant vs. 1000 K/T for the reaction CH4+H

CH3+H2,
with k in units of cm3 molecule−1 s−1. Experimental measurements, from Refs. [5], [12], and [14],
are indicated by dots. The dotted line corresponds to classical collision theory, while the dashed
and solid curves correspond to our quantum theory using T and Teﬀ , respectively, in the standard
deviations. The dash-dot curve shows results from Truong’s variational TST [10].

FIG. 3. Diﬀerence between log10 k and log10 kcl vs. 1000 K/T , where kcl is the rate con-
stant from classical collision theory with temperature-independent Ea. The units of k are
cm3 molecule−1 s−1. The symbols indicate experimental points from the following references: Ra-
binowitz et al. [14] (+); Sepehrad et al. [12] (✷); and the various studies reviewed by Shaw [5]
). The dashed and solid curve shows results from the present study, using Teﬀ in the standard
(
⋄
deviations of the Gaussian average. The dotted curve corresponds to classical TST, according to
Eq. (27), with Ea(T ) from the Gaussian average. The dash-dot curve corresponds to Truong’s
variational TST [10], which uses ab initio calculations for the potential energy. The dash-dot-dot
curve corresponds to the variational TST of Joseph et al. [8], which uses a semiempirical potential
function (“J3”).

FIG. 4. Diﬀerence between log10 k and log10 kcl vs. 1000 K/T , using the analytical expres-
sions for k(T ) in Table 1. kcl is the rate constant from classical collision theory with tempera-
ture-independent Ea. The units of k are cm3 molecule−1 s−1. The symbols indicate experimental
points, labeled as in Fig. 3. The dotted, dash-dot, dash-dot-dot, and dash-dot-dot-dot curves are
the empirical ﬁts from Sepehrad et al. [12], Shaw [5], Baulch et al. [13], and Rabinowitz et al. [14],
respectively. The solid and dashed curves are from the present study with a quadratic and a linear
ﬁt, respectively, for Ea.

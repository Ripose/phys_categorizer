Abstract

An accurate method to compute the annihilation rate in positronic systems by means of
quantum Monte Carlo simulations is tested and compared with previously proposed methods
using simple model systems. This method can be applied within all the quantum Monte Carlo
techniques, just requiring to accumulate the positron-electron distribution function. The annihi-
lation rate of e+LiH as a function of the internuclear distance is studied using a model potential
approach to eliminate the core electrons of Li, and explicitly correlated wave functions to deal
with all the remaining particles. These results allow us to compute vibrationally averaged an-
nihilation rates, and to understand the eﬀect of the Li+ electric ﬁeld on positron and electron
distributions.

I. INTRODUCTION

In positron and positronium (Ps) chemistry and physics, the annihilation rate Γ2γ plays an
important role since it correlates with many aspects of the local environment where the positron
annihilates. For instance, “pick-oﬀ” annihilation in solutions and in solid materials, “on the ﬂy”
annihilation in atomic and molecular gases, and bound state annihilation of positronic compounds
are just few of the experiments where Γ2γ can be measured and successively interpreted.

Although these experiments are relevant both technologically and scientiﬁcally [1, 2], only few
theoretical studies have been devoted to accurately compute annihilation rates for realistic systems
like atoms and molecules in order to compare with experimental data or to predict trends [3, 4, 5,
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. Moreover, these have been restricted to deal at most with four active electrons,
so that only a bunch of systems have been studied so far. We believe this scarceness of results to be
primarily due to the intrinsic diﬃculty in obtaining accurate wave functions for larger systems, and
to the computational eﬀort requested with respect to ordinary matter compounds when standard
ab initio methods are employed [12].

For these reasons, quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods [13] represent an alluring alternative
to these methods, to Density Functional Theory, and to explicitly correlated wave functions in
computing energies and properties of realistic positronic systems. QMC techniques are well described
in the literature, so we avoid to burden this paper with the details of the methods and constrain
ourselves to discuss only the technical issues relevant for the speciﬁc problem.

Not requiring the analytical calculation of integrals, QMC allows one to use any physically
sensible wave function. This possibility increases the chances to obtain an accurate description of any
class of systems once all the relevant physical information is included in the chosen analytical form of
the wave function. Having deﬁned a trail wave function ΨT for a system, QMC techniques allow one
to compute the diﬀerential and non-diﬀerential properties of the system by sampling Ψ2
T , ΨT Ψ0, or
Ψ2
0. Here, Ψ0 is the exact ground state function of the system. This task is usually accomplished by
creating a distribution of points (also known as conﬁgurations or walkers) in conﬁgurational space
whose density is proportional to the aforementioned Ψ2

T , ΨT Ψ0, or Ψ2
0.

Keeping in mind the above remarks, it might appear that the QMC methods should accurately
predict any interesting observable for positronic systems. This is indeed correct except for extremely
local operators like Dirac’s delta δ, and hence for Γ2γ that is proportional to its expectation value,
for which an accurate sampling of small conﬁgurational space volumes is needed. These operators
are well known to represent a challenge for QMC due to the discrete nature of the conﬁguration
ensemble and the ﬁnite length of the simulations.

As far as the mean value of the Dirac’s delta δ operator is concerned, one faces an additional
diﬃculty when trying to estimate its mean value. Even admitting a perfect sampling in the regions
where two particles are close to each other, the primitive method of counting the number of times
the interparticle distance r is smaller than a given radius rw (i.e. counting the ones that fall into
0 [11].
a spherical well of radius rw) [5] has an associated statistical error that diverges for rw
This fact means that the estimation of the statistical error of the extrapolated value is based on
shaky grounds.

→

Although not a solution, a slightly better approach was devised by substituting the simple sphere
with a Gaussian function centered at the coalescence point [8, 9, 11]. The variance of this estimator
also goes to inﬁnity upon decreasing of the Gaussian width, but it diverges less faster than the

As far as variational Monte Carlo (VMC) is concerned, diﬀerent methods have been proposed
that may solve this diﬃculty allowing one to compute the needed quantities. One of these methods

where R = (r1, r2, ..., r+) is a point in conﬁguration space, and the trial wave function ΨT is

T , it
is well known that its variance diverges over the same distribution [14]. This fact implies that no
error bound (i.e. standard deviation) can be associated to its value, a dangerous situation one would
like to avoid.

Langfelder et al.

[14] proposed a possible way to circumvent this problem based on a modiﬁed

importance sampling transformation where Ψ2

Always starting from Eq. 2, one could also exploit the approach proposed by Assaraf and Caﬀarel
P
[15] to compute the expectation value needed to obtain nuclear forces by means of the Hellman-
Feynmann theorem. They showed that a judicious choice of a renormalized operator, whose mean
value is equal to the original one, can reduce the inﬁnite variance to a ﬁnite value [16].

T .

A completely diﬀerent approach was pursued by Alexander and Coldwell

[17]. They proposed
to compute all the mean values sampling an analytically normalizable distribution function g(R),
so that the normalization NT of ΨT is easily estimated by means of

strained on the subspace r+ = r1, is employed to guide the simulation and to compute N c
T in Eq.
3, then

can be easily estimated by the (N c

T /NT )2 ratio.

Although these three methods represent a step towards the solution of this complicate problem
in the VMC framework and are currently used for ordinary electronic compounds with success, the
situation still remains far from being satisfactory for positronic systems. For these systems beyond
the problem of the method used to compute
, there is another diﬃculty: as far as we know, nobody
i
has been able to optimize an accurate ΨT for a positronic system with more than four electrons.
More speciﬁcally, for large systems explicit correlation between the electrons and the positron has
been found diﬃcult to introduce [11]. This means that the ”pile up” of the electron density over the
positron is not correctly described, therefore giving rise to too small annihilation rates [18]. Possible
sources of this unwanted outcome are the lack of knowledge about the complicate analytical form
that such an accurate wave function should have, and some drawbacks of the optimization method
used [19].

In order to go beyond these diﬃculties, the diﬀusion Monte Carlo (DMC) method is usually
employed to sample ΨT Ψ0
[20, 21, 22]. This technique is able to project out the contribution of
the excited states from the starting ΨT , allowing the exact calculation of the ground state energy.
Unfortunately, the δ(r−+) operator does not commute with the Hamiltonian of the system, so that
the simulation results are only an approximation to the exact mean value when computed by means
of the mixed estimator

in any way. This idea rules out the possibility to use Eq. 1, since one just samples the exact Ψ2

as a promising way, we noticed in our work on positron complexes [23] that long decaying times
are needed in order to project out all the excited state contributions and to correctly build the ”pile
up” of the electron density over the positron if ΨT poorly describes this feature. This fact produces
large ﬂuctuations in the weight values, therefore increasing the statistical noise of the results.

[14] proposed to correct

A better approach may be represented by the use of the tagging algorithm proposed by Barnett
[24] in connection with the branching step usually employed in DMC. Here, the ratio Ψ0/ΨT ,

0, is computed by means of the number of daughters of each conﬁguration.

Moreover, Baroni and Moroni

[25] have recently proposed an alternative algorithm that appears
to be well suited for this task. This is based on a “Path Integral” view of the DMC algorithm, where
the branching step has been substituted by an accept/reject step in order to exactly sample Ψ2
0.

Unfortunately, these approaches do not solve the problem of the scarce sampling in the volume
around r = 0, a problem that is present even for small simulation time steps. As stated previously,
this comes from the ﬁnite length and discrete nature of the QMC simulations. As an attempt to
overcome this diﬃculty, Langfelder et al.
[14] implemented in their algorithm the correct sampling of
the electron-nucleus cusp region as proposed by Umrigar et al.
[26]: this, however, does not appear
straightforward to adopt to correct the sampling of both the electron-electron and electron-positron
cusps.

Keeping in mind all the aforementioned problems in estimating

The main aim of this paper is to discuss and test the accuracy of computing

using some
simple methods based only on the sampling of the positron-electron distribution function without
any usage of the diﬀerential identity Eq. 1. These methods will be compared with the Gaussian
approximation discussing relative merits and applicability. Moreover, we apply them to the realistic
e+LiH model case in order to study the annihilation rate as a function of the internuclear distance R.
The Γ2γ versus R results will allow to compute the vibrationally averaged annihilation rate for this
system and to discuss molecular environment eﬀects on the annihilation rate itself and on contact
distribution functions.

We want to stress that the shape of the distribution was found independent of the time step over
a broad range of values. This ensures that no systematic bias is present due to the ﬁnite time step.
From Figure 1 one can easily notice the abrupt decrease of the distribution in the region close to
r = 0. This represents the aforementioned inability of Monte Carlo simulations to correctly sample
the distribution close to a coalescence point in spite of the large number of sampled conﬁgurations. It
also seems to indicate that, due to this inability, any well-based method (e.g. both the spherical well
and Gaussian methods) should return an inaccurate answer for rw smaller that a certain threshold.
Conversely, all the regions with r > 0.5 bohr seem to be adequately described by the sampled
distribution, and therefore we propose to analytically continue their shape extrapolating to r = 0 by
means of a suitable functional form. This idea allows one to exploit the knowledge about the exact
form of Ω to improve the local description in the small radius regions. For instance, if one samples
f = Ψ2
0, the exact value of the cusp condition can be used as a way to constrain the model to behave
correctly. This trick can also be used in both the VMC and DMC simulations, since it is often easy
to obtain the cusp condition of the sampled f knowing the analytical form of ΨT . This method could
be implemented in two diﬀerent ways. First, one could choose an analytical function ω(r) to ﬁt Ω
for all the electron-positron distances. This function should be ﬂexible enough to properly describe
both short range and long range behavior of Ω. More speciﬁcally, close to r = 0 Ω(r) behaves like

choice for ω(r) is the Pad´e-Jastrow form

(9)

where α can be chosen in order to have ω(r) satisfying the correct local behavior close to r = 0.
The ﬁtted form can successively be used to estimate both Ω(0) and the denominator in Eq. 7.

Second, if the form of Ω(r) is more complicated (e.g. it has multiple maxima), it is possible to
resort to a local ﬁt by ω(r) in the region close to the cusp in order to get the Ω(0) value. Then, the
normalization integral could be split in two part, one computed using ω(r) and the other directly
using the sampled distribution. Speciﬁcally for the distribution in Figure 1, one could ﬁt the sampled
Ω values in the range [0.5,1.0] bohr constraining ω(r) to have both the exact cusp behavior and to
have the same value of the sampled Ω for r=1.0 bohr. Then, the normalization integral can be
estimated integrating numerically ω(r) for 0
1.0, and employing the trapezoidal formula for
≤
the remaining sampled values. We would like to mention that this necessity is already present for
small systems like e+Be [27].

Although the two proposed methods are approximate, they might prove themselves to be quite
accurate in practice, allowing the Monte Carlo practitioner to easily estimate the collision probability
between two particles. In turn, this will allow to compute the annihilation rate in positronic systems,
therefore opening the chance to directly compare with the experimental results.

In order to show that this is exactly the case, in the next section we present the results obtained
for some model systems whose exact values are easily obtained using diﬀerent

computing
methods.

Methods similar to ours, although quite diﬀerent in many details, have been applied by Ortiz
[28] and by Mair´i Fraser
[29] to the case of a positron embedded in the jellium. Their methods
were somehow tailored to the speciﬁc system under study, so that no direct comparison with our
proposals can be made. Nevertheless, the results they extracted from the simulations can be useful
to seek for possible correlations between the magnitude of the ”pile up” eﬀect and the local electron
density.

III. TEST OF THE METHODS USING MODEL SYSTEMS

To test the accuracy of the proposed methods, we computed the

expectation value for
simple model systems composed only by one electron and one positron. More speciﬁcally, some
model wave functions Ψi were chosen in order to represent the variety of electron, positron and
electron-positron distributions that could be found in a positron atomic system. Then, the Ψ2
i ’s
were sampled by means of VMC simulations similar to the one discussed above, in order to collect
the electron-positron distribution Ω.

We selected three model systems as representative of a fairly large class of positron complexes.

The two distributions sampled as a function of r from Ψ2 and Ψ3 turned out to possess a behavior
quite similar to Ψ1. Therefore, we avoid to show all of them and refer to Figure 1 as a template for
such distributions. Due to their smoothness, we ﬁtted them using Eq. 9 over the range 0.3-10 bohr
constraining the Pad´e-Jastrow form to have the exact cusp condition, i.e. -0.5, -1.0, and -1.0, for
the three Ψi respectively. To test the correctness of the chosen ﬁtting range, we modiﬁed slightly
the lower limit without ﬁnding statistically meaningful diﬀerences. Then, the ﬁtted ω was used to
estimate both Ω(0) and the denominator in Eq. 7 by means of numerical integration. The computed

0.01 in order to obtain a meaningful extrapolation. Although this may look some way problematic

IV. THE e+LiH SYSTEM

Having veriﬁed the accuracy of the proposed method in computing Dirac’s delta mean values, we
applied it to the calculation of the annihilation rate Γ2γ of e+LiH for various internuclear distances
R.

Although this system has already been carefully studied employing both QMC methods [11, 31]
and Explicitly Correlated Gaussian (ECG) functions [6, 7, 32], a description of Γ2γ as a function of
the molecular geometry is still lacking. Up to now, there are only

and the non-adiabatic results of Mitroy and Ryhzikh, 0.034016 and 0.032588 [32]. These last values
were obtained using ECG in connection , respectively, with the Stochastic Variational Minimization
(SVM) and the Frozen-Core SVM (FCSVM) methods, and are roughly 15-20% larger than the ECG
[6, 7] and DMC [11] clamped-nuclei ones. This unexpected result lead Strasburger [6] to consider
the possibility of the ﬂattening of the potential energy curve of e+LiH with respect to the LiH one, a
feature that may allow the positronic molecule to visit the large internuclear distance region where
the Dirac’s delta mean value is expected to be larger. However, Mitroy and Ryhzikh [32] pointed
out that simple ECG’s may not represent the best basis functions to describe vibrational nuclear
motion, and that their vibrational averaged nuclear distances are probably too large.

In a previous work [31], we computed the complete curve using the DMC technique, showing
that the ﬂattening is indeed present, and that a strong red shift of the vibrational spectrum with
respect to LiH must be expected. Unfortunately, due to the high computational cost of our highly

correlated trial wave functions, at that time we did not compute the behavior of
of R. In this work we still adopt the BO approximation, so we predict the annihilation rate for each
vibrational state of the system and compare our values with the non-adiabatic results of Mitroy and
Ryhzikh [32].

In order to study the eﬀect of the molecular geometry on the annihilation rate without using the
computationally expensive wave function used in Ref.
[11], we decided to employ a model potential
approach to eliminate the “core” electrons of the Li+ fragment. We believe such an approach to
be physically well grounded, as explained by the following supporting reasons. First, the ECG
[6, 7] on the e+LiH system show that the annihilation
calculations carried out by Strasburger
takes place primarily with the two electrons that may be attributed to the H− fragment. Secondly,
the frozen core approximation developed by Mitroy and Ryhzikh [4] has been found to describe
accurately the annihilation process in e+Li, e+Be, LiPs, and e+He 3S when compared with the
corresponding all-electron calculations.

In order to reduce the number of active electrons, we used for e+LiH the model Hamiltonian

To test the accuracy of this model potential, we computed the energy for the ground state of the
three systems Li, Li−, and LiPs. The energy values are respectively -0.1953(2) hartree, -0.2191(3)
hartree, and -0.4485(3) hartree. They give an electron aﬃnity of 0.0238(4) hartree, a positron aﬃnity
(PA) of 0.2294(4) hartree, and a Ps binding energy (BE) of 0.0032(4) hartree. While the electron
aﬃnity turns out to be in fair agreement with the experimental value, namely 0.023 hartree [34],
both PA and BE are roughly 0.009 hartree smaller than the best estimate [4]. These discrepancies
might be due to the absence of polarization eﬀects of the core electrons due to the two active
electrons and the positron, and to a relatively inaccurate representation of the 1s2 electron density

by means of a single STO-1s function. Nevertheless, since we are primarily interested in obtaining
a semiquantitative description of the changes in Γ2γ for this system, we believe the approximations
introduced in the model Hamiltonian to be small enough to allow for a correct prediction of the
trend for this important observable.

In order to accurately describe the wave function of the three active particles at the VMC level,
we employed a trial wave function form similar to the one used in Ref.
[11], but slightly modiﬁed
to include the polarization of the electron and positron density of the PsH fragment due to the
Li+ potential. Speciﬁcally, the analytical form in Eq. 7 of Ref.
[11] has been multiplied by a
Pad´e-Jastrow factor depending on the z coordinate of each particle: the z axis was chosen as the
LiH bond axis, the H nucleus being located at the origin and the Li on the negative z axis. The
wave function parameters were fully optimized for every nuclear distance R minimizing the variance
of the local energy over a ﬁxed sample of conﬁgurations [35, 36]. This procedure is already well
described in the literature [13], so we skip the unnecessary details. The ensemble of walkers used
in the optimization was generated by DMC simulations in order to bias the walkers distribution
towards the exact density. Usually, four or ﬁve optimization steps were carried out for each R.

We started the optimization process of the wave function at R=20 [11]. At the end of the
optimization procedure, R was decreased and the wave function re-optimized for the new distance.
This procedure gives the chance to monitor the changes of the wave function with R, but might
increase the possibility to remain stuck in a local minimum in the parameter space during the
optimization.

Having optimized at VMC level the approximate wave functions for various distances, these were
employed in long DMC simulations to project out the remaining excited state contributions and
to compute more accurate mixed expectation values. For all the simulations, a time step of 0.005
hartree−1 was used, together with a population of 9000 walkers. These two simulation parameters
were found adequate to make statistically negligible both the time step bias and the population
eﬀect in the DMC simulations.

accurate, so that a discrepancy between the two sets of results is expected. It is also important to
remember that the Bardsley’s potential was tailored only to describe the atom in its ground and
valence excited states, not to describe correctly bonds in molecules.

electron-positron distribution. From this comparison, one could expect our estimation to slightly
degrade on going towards small R, without becoming embarrassing inaccurate to create concerns
about the usefulness of this model system.

The overall trend of the collision probability shows a net decrease on going towards short R, a
feature already suggested by Mitroy and Ryzhikh [32]. This can be easily understood remembering
that the Li+ model potential repels the positron, while attracting the two electrons. It is not easy
to infer any possible analytical model to describe these joined eﬀects, although for large R one could
propose a limiting 1/R2 form due to the polarization of the two distributions by the electric ﬁeld of
Li+. We show in the Appendix that this reasoning is indeed correct for any observable by means
of ﬁrst order Perturbation Theory. An “experimental” evidence that this is the case is given by the
results at R=10, 15, and 20 bohr with the simple form 0.0486 + b/R2,

Various other mean values were computed during the DMC simulations in order to obtain some
physical insight on the electron and positron density behavior. Figure 4 reports the mean value
of the z coordinate for the two particles giving information on the polarization of the two lepton
densities.
It is clear that the positronic distribution is polarized by the model potential in the
opposite direction to the electronic one. Moreover, it appears to be more easily polarized than the
electronic one always showing larger
values. This fact can be easily explained by noticing that
the positron distribution is more diﬀuse that the electron one, so that it is more strongly repelled by
the electric ﬁeld. Interestingly, at R=2 and 2.5 bohr the electron distribution reverse its polarization
> 0. We believe this eﬀect to be due to the repulsive region of the Li+ core potential
showing
that pushes away the electrons for such small nuclear distances, therefore modeling the exchange
eﬀect created by an antisymmetric wave function.

Figure 5 shows the average values for the electron-electron and electron-positron distances. While
increases monotonically upon decreasing R, the electron-
the electron-positron mean distance
electron distance
shows a shallow maximum around R=8 bohr and a deep minimum around
R=2.5 bohr. We believe the maximum to be due to the competition between the positron and the
Li+ model potential to bind an electron. More speciﬁcally, although polarized towards positive z,
the positron still attracts one of the two electrons to form the Ps sub-cluster, increasing the distance
from the second electron that is free to be polarized in the direction of the Li+ core. On going
towards smaller R, the positron is pushed far out the bond region, loosing its ability to polarize the
electrons that are now both strongly attracted by the model potential. This interaction leads them
to move in the small volume between H and Li+, therefore decreasing their mean distance. Then, for
R smaller than 2.5 bohr, the electron-core repulsion pushes the electrons outwards the bond region,
with the net eﬀect to increase their mean distance. This eﬀect has also been observed by plotting
the intracule electron distributions obtained during the DMC simulations.

It is worth to mention that similar conclusions can be drawn analysing the VMC results obtained

as a by-product of the optimization stages.

appears that the ground level vibrational motion only slightly increases the probability of collision
between the electrons and the positron with respect to the one at the equilibrium distance. This
ﬁnding is in line with the small diﬀerence between the equilibrium distance and the average nuclear

[7] suggesting a
fairly large eﬀect of the nuclear motion, we believe this outcome is primarily due to the 7% larger
collision probabilities computed using our model system. These two evidences seem to rule out the
Strasburger’s suggestion [6] of a large increase of the collision probability due to the quantum nuclear
motion for the ν = 0 state. They indicate that approximating the averaged collision probability for
the vibrational ground state simply by using its value at the equilibrium distance could be a fairly
accurate procedure. Moreover, these conclusions agree with Mitroy and Ryhzikh [32] warnings
that both the SVM and FCSVM results, although proving the overall stability of e+LiH, are not
well converged to the exact ones. For instance, their
i0 values, respectively 4.182 bohr and 3.964
bohr, are larger than the minimum of the ECG and DMC potential curves by more than 0.5 bohr.
This discrepancy cannot be accounted for by the zero point motion of the positron complex. These
larger distances between the two fragments Li+ and PsH in the non-adiabatic treatment imply a
reduced distortion of the lepton densities of PsH with respect to the one at the Born-Oppenheimer
equilibrium, and therefore a too large annihilation rate. However, it is interesting to notice that
both FCSVM (0.032588) and SVM (0.034016)
[32] collision probabilities are really close to our
Born-Oppenheimer one at R =4.0 bohr. In our view, this agreement stresses, again, the importance
of the local electric ﬁeld in deﬁning the collision probability and the overall accuracy of the SVM
approach in describing the relative densities an a positronic complex.

indicates that the annihilation rate does depend on the quantum vibrational state of the molecule.
Although the trend of these results could be speciﬁc of the e+LiH system and perhaps of other
polar molecules as well, it strongly indicates that any theory formulated to describe “on the ﬂy”
annihilation of e+ due to Feshbach resonances must include this eﬀect in order to go beyond “order
of magnitude comparison” [38] and to predict accurately the annihilation rate. In our view, this
opens a new avenue of exploration in positron physical chemistry where the understanding of the
vibrational motion eﬀect on positron annihilation by molecular systems is of prime importance.

V. CONCLUSIONS

In this work we have critically compared methods that may be useful to compute the annihilation
rate in positronic systems in the framework of the QMC methods. Moreover, we have presented
a simple, but nevertheless solid and accurate, method based only on the interparticle distribution
sampling. After having tested it using model systems, we employed the method to compute

total energy than Be+ and PsO [39]), and to move on the O side of the molecule when the distance
decreases. This eﬀect is due to the electron transfer from Be to O that creates the large molecular

It is also interesting to speculate on the behavior of the annihilation rate versus the vibrational
quantum number for other simple systems like e+Li2 and e+Be2. Here, the symmetry of the systems
can play an important role in deﬁning the annihilation rate. For instance, decreasing the nuclear
distance one may expect to ﬁnd the positron localized between the two atomic fragments due to its
ability to polarize the two atomic electron densities: in this situation the annihilation rate could be
quite diﬀerent from the atomic one. Although it is easy to infer the existence of a bound state for
these complexes at large nuclear distances employing the basic Valence Bond resonance idea

e+A1 + A2 ←→

A1 + e+A2

(18)

it still remains to demonstrate the stability of these systems for nuclear distances close to the
equilibrium geometry of the neutral parent molecules.

[40]. For the X 1Σ+

As rule of thumb to predict the stability of a non-polar molecule, one can use the adiabatic
ionization potential (AIP) as proposed by Mitroy et al.
g ground state of Li2 the
experimental AIP is 0.189 hartree [41], slightly lower than the atomic one, 0.19814 hartree [42].
Also for the X 1Σ+
g ground state of Be2, one might expect a similar lowering of the AIP with respect
to the atomic one, 0.343 hartree [42], so that a value of around 0.335 hartree could be regarded as
a safe upper bound to the true AIP. Both these values fall inside the upper and lower IP limits for
positron binding obtained by Mitroy et al.
[40] for one and two valence electron atoms, therefore
suggesting that the two complexes should be stable. We understand that this model is just a rough
[43]. Nevertheless, a positron bound to an atom or a
approximation for our molecular systems
molecule is always characterized by a quite diﬀuse density. This allows one to neglect some of the
real features of the electron density close to the nuclei as a ﬁrst approximation, and focus only on the
asymptotic properties of the positron cloud that are correlated to the IP and to the polarizability.
As far as Be2 is concerned, the AIP larger than the Ps binding energy (0.25 hartree) suggests
a mechanism based on the electron cloud polarization as responsible of the binding. Moreover, the
lowering of the AIP with respect to the atomic one, and the large polarizability of this molecule
(roughly twice the atomic one) seem to indicate its ability to form a stronger bond with the positron
[4]. Conversely, Li2 has an AIP smaller than the Ps binding energy,
than the Be atom alone
suggesting that the polarization of the Ps cluster may be held responsible for the positron binding.
However, Li is close to the lower stability threshold of the positron-atom complexes, and we do
not feel conﬁdent in proposing the stability of the molecular complex with respect to the Ps+Li+
2
dissociation pathway.

Right now, QMC methods are the best suited computational techniques to carry out such a
study since 6 and 8 electron systems are too large to be studied with ECG’s unless the frozen core
approximation is used. With the addition to the QMC “bag of tricks” of a robust method for
computing annihilation rates such a study could become routine in molecular physical chemistry,
allowing the exploration of many interesting features of these “exotic” compounds.

Moreover, many more other technically oriented applications could be devised. Positronium
annihilation in polymers and membranes, positron annihilation in silicon nanocluster, nanodevices,
fullerenes and carbon nanotubes are just few of them that could be quite easily interpreted with the
help of such a method.

Our hope is that this work will help this kind of applications to blossom and to lead to a better

understanding of the basic interaction schemes that positron has with ordinary matter.

local energy resulted in a reduction of the positron-nuclear repulsion instead of increasing the

[27] M. Mella, (Unpublished). The electron-positron distributions in the e+Be and e+Mg systems
show minima and maxima that are ﬁngerprints of the multi-shell atomic structure. The same
eﬀect is much less evident for LiPs.

In this paper we overview some results on the hydrogen atom
in external static uniform magnetic ﬁelds. We focus on the case of
very strong magnetic ﬁeld, B
109 Gauss, use various
approximate models and, particularly, in the adiabatic approxima-
tion have calculated exactly the integral deﬁning the eﬀective poten-
tial. This potential appears to be ﬁnite at z = 0. Our consider-
ation of the problem of highly magnetized atoms and molecules is
motivated by the recently developed MagneGas technology by San-
tilli (http://www.magnegas.com). The ground state electron charge
distribution of the hydrogen atom in an intense magnetic ﬁeld is of
a toroidal form, in agreement with that studied by Santilli. This
physical picture is at the foundation of the new chemical species of
magnecules proposed by Santilli.

1 Introduction

Weak external static uniform magnetic ﬁeld B causes anomalous Zeeman
splitting of the energy levels of the hydrogen atom, with ignorably small
eﬀect on the charge distribution of the electron. In the case of a more intense
magnetic ﬁeld which is strong enough to cause decoupling of a spin-orbital
105 Gauss, a
interaction (in atoms), e¯hB/2mc > ∆Ejj′
normal Zeeman eﬀect is observed, again with ignorably small deformation of
the electron orbits.

In the case of weak external magnetic ﬁeld B, one can ignore the quadra-
tic term in the ﬁeld B because its contribution is small in comparison with
that of the other terms in Schr¨odinger equation so that the linear approxi-
mation in the ﬁeld B can be used. In such a linear approximation, the wave
function of electron remains unperturbed, with the only eﬀect being the well
known Zeeman splitting of the energy levels of the hydrogen atom. In both
Zeeman eﬀects, the energy of interaction of electron with the magnetic ﬁeld is
assumed to be much smaller than the binding energy of the hydrogen atom,
me4/2¯h2 = 13.6 eV, i.e. the intensity of the magnetic ﬁeld is
e¯hB/2mc
109 Gauss =
much smaller than some characteristic value, B
240000 Tesla (1 Tesla = 104 Gauss). Thus, the action of a weak magnetic
ﬁeld can be treated as a small perturbation of the hydrogen atom.

In the case of very strong magnetic ﬁeld, B

B0, the quadratic term in
the ﬁeld B makes a great contribution and can not be ignored. Calculations
show that a considerable deformation of the electron charge distribution in
the hydrogen atom occurs. Namely, under the inﬂuence of a very strong
external magnetic ﬁeld a magnetic conﬁnement takes place, i.e. in the plane
perpendicular to the direction of magnetic ﬁeld the electron dynamics is
determined mainly by the action of the magnetic ﬁeld, while the Coulomb
interaction of the electron with the nucleus can be viewed as a small per-
turbation. This adiabatic approximation allows one to separate variables in
Schr¨odinger equation [1]. At the same time, in the direction along the di-
rection of the magnetic ﬁeld the motion of electron is governed both by the
magnetic ﬁeld eﬀects and the Coulomb interaction of the electron with the
nucleus.

In this paper we brieﬂy review some results on the hydrogen atom in very
strong external static uniform magnetic ﬁelds, focusing on the basic physical
picture derived from the Schr¨odinger equation. Our consideration of the

1

problem of atoms and molecules exposed to strong external magnetic ﬁeld
is related to MagneGas technology and PlasmaArcFlow hadronic molecular
reactors recently developed by Santilli [2].

The highest intensities maintained macroscopically at large distances in
modern magnet laboratories are of the order of 105...106 Gauss (
50 Tesla),
109 Gauss (
105 Tesla). An extremely intense ex-
i.e. much below B0 = 2.4
1013 Gauss, corresponds to the
BS = B0/α2 = 4.4
ternal magnetic ﬁeld, B
interaction energy of the order of mass of electron, mc2 = 0.5 MeV; α = e2/¯hc
is the ﬁne structure constant. In this case, despite the fact that the extremely
strong magnetic ﬁeld does not make vacuum unstable in respect to creation
of electron-positron pairs, one should account for relativistic and quantum
electrodynamics (QED) eﬀects, and invoke Dirac or Bethe-Salpeter equation.
Such intensities are not currently available in laboratories. However, these
are of interest in astrophysics, for example in studying an atmosphere of
109 . . . 1013
neutron stars and white dwarfs which is characterized by B
Gauss.

In this paper, we shall not consider intensities as high as Schwinger value
1011
BS, and restrict our review by the intensities 2.4
Gauss (10B0 . . . 100B0), at which (nonrelativistic) Schr¨odinger equation can
be used to a very good accuracy, and the adiabatic approximation can be
made.

Relativistic and QED eﬀects (loop contributions), as well as the eﬀects
such as those related to the ﬁnite mass, size, and magnetic moment of the
nucleus, and the ﬁnite electromagnetic radius of electron, reveal themselves
even at low magnetic ﬁeld intensities, and can be accounted for as very small
perturbations. These are beyond the scope of the present paper, while being
of much importance in the high precision studies, such as those on stringent
tests of the Lamb shift.

It should be noted that a locally high-intensity magnetic ﬁeld may arise
in the plasma as the result of nonlinear eﬀects, which can lead to creation
of stable self-conﬁned structures having a nontrivial topology with knots [3].
Particularly, Faddeev and Niemi [3] recently argued that the static equilib-
rium conﬁgurations within the plasma are topologically stable solitons, that
describe knotted and linked ﬂuxtubes of helical magnetic ﬁelds. In the region
close to such ﬂuxtubes, we suppose the magnetic ﬁeld intensity may be as
high as B0. In view of this, study of the action of strong magnetic ﬁeld and
the ﬂuxtubes of magnetic ﬁelds on atoms and molecules becomes of much

2

interest in theoretical and applicational plasmachemistry.

Possible applications are in MagneGas technology, theoretical founda-
tions and exciting implications of which are developed by Santilli [2]. We
refer the reader to Ref. [2] for the recent studies, description, and applica-
tions of MagneGas technology and PlasmaArcFlow reactors. Remarkable ex-
perimental results, including Gas-Chromatographic Mass-Spectroscopic and
InfraRed spectrum data of Santilli’s magnegas, clearly indicates the presence
of unconventional chemical species of magnecules, which have not been iden-
tiﬁed as conventional molecules, and are supposed to be due to the speciﬁc
bonding of a magnetic origin. The basic physical picture of the magnecules
proposed by Santilli [2] is related to the toroidal orbitals of the electrons of
atoms exposed to a very strong magnetic ﬁeld. The results of the present
paper demonstrate this physical picture on the basis of the Schr¨odinger equa-
tion.

≃

As the result of the action of very strong magnetic ﬁeld, atoms attain
great binding energy as compared to the case of zero magnetic ﬁeld. Even
B0, the binding energy of atoms greatly deviates from
at intermediate B
that of zero-ﬁeld case, and even lower ﬁeld intensities may essentially aﬀect
chemical properties of molecules of heavy atoms. This enables creation of
various other bound states in molecules, clusters and bulk matter [1, 2, 4].
The paper by Lai [4], who focused on very strong magnetic ﬁelds, B

B0,
motivated by the astrophysical applications, gives a good survey of the early
and recent studies in this ﬁeld, including those on the intermediate range,
B0, multi-electron atoms, and H2 molecule. Much number of papers
B
using variational/numerical and/or analytical approaches to the problem of
light and heavy atoms, ions, and H2 molecule in strong magnetic ﬁeld, have
been published within the last six years (see, e.g., references in [4]). However,
highly magnetized molecules of heavy atoms have not been systematically
investigated. One of the surprising implications is that for some diatomic
molecules of heavy atoms, the molecular binding energy is predicted to be
several times bigger than the ground state energy of individual atoms. [5]

2 Landau levels of a single electron

To estimate intensity of the magnetic ﬁeld which causes a considerable de-
formation of the ground state electron orbit of the hydrogen atom, one can

3

formally compare the Bohr radius of the hydrogen atom in the ground state,
in zero external magnetic ﬁeld, a0 = ¯h2/me2
10−8 cm = 1 a.u., with
the radius of orbit of a single electron moving in the external static uniform
magnetic ﬁeld ~B. Below, we give a brief summary of the latter issue.

Figure 1: Classical orbit of the electron in an external static uniform magnetic
ﬁeld ~B = (0, 0, B) pointed along the z axis. The electron experiences a
circular motion in the x, y plane and a linear motion in the z direction (a
helical curve).

The mean radius of the orbital of a single electron moving in a static
uniform magnetic ﬁeld can be calculated exactly using Schr¨odinger equation,
and is given by

where we have denoted

B is the intensity of the magnetic ﬁeld pointed along the z axis, ~B = (0, 0, B),
~r = (r, ϕ, z) in cylindrical coordinates, and n = 0, 1, . . . is the principal
quantum number. Thus, the radius of the orbit takes discrete set of values
(2.1), and is referred to as Landau radius. This is in contrast to the well
known classical motion of electron in the external magnetic ﬁeld (a helical

set of values. The classical approach evidently can not be applied to study
dynamics of the electron at atomic distances.

The wave function (2.6) depends on the angle ϕ as exp[ilϕ], and the energy
(2.3) does not depend on the azimuthal quantum number l, so the system
reveals a rotational symmetry in respect to the angle ϕ and all the Landau
orbits are round.

Also, the energy (2.3) does not depend on the radial quantum number
s. This means a degeneracy of the system in respect to the position of the
center of the orbit, and corresponds to an ”unﬁxed” position of the center.
At n
s > 0, the origin of the coordinate system is inside the orbit while at
−
s < 0 it is outside the orbit. The mean distance d between the origin of
n
coordinate system and the center of orbit takes a discrete set of values, and
is related to the quantum number s as follows:

−

Clearly, the energy (2.3) does not depend on this distance because of the
homogeneity of the magnetic ﬁeld, so it does not depend on s. However,
it should be noted that the whole Landau orbit can not move on the (r, ϕ)
plane continuously along the variation of the coordinate r. Instead, it can
only ”jump” to a certain distance, which depends on the intensity of the
magnetic ﬁeld, in accord to Eq. (2.9).

3 Hydrogen atom in magnetic ﬁelds

After we have considered quantum dynamics of a single electron in the ex-
ternal magnetic ﬁeld, we turn to consideration of the hydrogen atom in the
external static uniform magnetic ﬁeld.

We choose cylindrical coordinate system (r, ϕ, z), in which the external
magnetic ﬁeld is ~B = (0, 0, B), i.e., the magnetic ﬁeld is directed along the
z-axis. General Schr¨odinger equation for the electron moving around a ﬁxed
proton (Born-Oppenheimer approximation) in the presence of the external
magnetic ﬁeld is

where γ = eH/2¯hc. Note the presence of the term 2iγ∂ϕ, which is linear in
γ2r2, which is quadratic in B. The other terms do not
B, and of the term
depend on the magnetic ﬁeld B.

−

The main problem in the nonrelativistic study of the hydrogen atom in
the external magnetic ﬁeld is to solve the above Schr¨odinger equation and
ﬁnd the energy spectrum.

In this equation, we can not directly separate all the variables, r, ϕ, and
z, because of the presence of the Coulomb potential, e2/√r2 + z2, which does
not allow us to make a direct separation in variables r and z.

Also, for the general case of an arbitrary intensity of the magnetic ﬁeld,
we can not ignore the term γ2r2 in Eq. (3.1), which is quadratic in B, since
this term is not small at high intensities of the magnetic ﬁeld.

(3.2)

Under the above condition, in the transverse plane the Coulomb interaction
of the electron with the nucleus is not important in comparison with the
interaction of the electron with the external magnetic ﬁeld. So, in accord to
the exact solution (2.6) for a single electron, one can seek for an approximate
[1]) of factorized
ground state solution of Eq. (3.1) in the form (see, e.g.
transverse and longitudinal parts,

ψ = e−γr2/2χ(z),

(3.3)

where we have used Landau wave function (2.14), s = 0, l = 0, and χ(z)
denotes the longitudinal wave function to be found. This is so called adiabatic
approximation. The charge distribution of the electron in the (r, ϕ) plane
e−γr2/2, i.e. by the
is thus characterized by the Landau wave function
azimuthal symmetry.

∼

In general, the adiabatic approximation corresponds to the case when the
transverse motion of electron is totally determined by the intense magnetic
ﬁeld, which makes it ”dance” at its cyclotron frequency. Speciﬁcally, the
radius of the orbit is then much smaller than the Bohr radius, R0 ≪
a0, or,
equivalently, the Landau energy of electron is much bigger than the Bohr
energy E⊥
= 13.6 eV. In other words, this approximation means
that the interaction of electron with the nucleus in the transverse plane is

ignorably small (it is estimated to make about 2% correction at B

Gauss), and the energy spectrum in this plane is deﬁned solely by the Lan-
dau levels. The remaining problem is thus to ﬁnd the longitudinal energy
spectrum, in the z direction.

Inserting wave function (3.3) into the Schr¨odinger equation (3.1), multi-
plying it by ψ∗, and integrating over variables r and ϕ in cylindrical coordi-
nate system, we get the following equation characterizing the z dependence

In general, because of the prefactor xe−x/2 in the solution (3.18) which
cancels some of the divergencies arising from the hypergeometric functions,
we should take into account both of the two linearly independent solutions,
to get the most general form of normalizable wave functions.

As a consequence, the eigenvalues may diﬀer from those corresponding
to n = 1, 2, . . . (which is an analogue of the principal quantum number in
the ordinary hydrogen atom) so that n is allowed to take some non-integer
values from 0 to

, provided that the wave function is normalizable.

We are interested in the ground state solution, which is an even state.

Also, since n = 1 gives E′ =

normalizable wave function for n in the interval 0 < n < 1, in order to
1/2 a.u. If it is successful,
achieve the energy value, which is lower than
the value n = 1 indeed does not characterize the ground state. Instead, it
may correspond to some excited state.

One can see that the problem is in a remarkable diﬀerence from the ordi-
nary three-dimensional problem of the hydrogen atom, for which the principal
quantum number n must be integer to get normalizable wave functions, and
the value n = 1 corresponds to the lowest energy. The distinction is due to
the fact that the additional factor x in the solution (3.18) does not cancel in
the total wave function1.

We restrict consideration by the even state so we can focus on the x

(r, ϕ) planes, one at the level z =

Consequently, Eq. (3.4) with the exactly calculated C(z) will yield the
ground state of electron in the z direction which is drastically diﬀerent from
that with the Coulomb potential considered in Sect. 3.1.1. Thus, very intense
magnetic ﬁeld essentially aﬀects dynamics of electron not only in the (r, ϕ)
plane but also in the z direction. We expect that for the case of exact
potential (3.5) the ground state is characterized by much lower energy in the
z direction as compared to that of the one-dimensional Bohr state (3.23).

The exact potential C(z) can be well approximated by the modiﬁed

The l.h.s of this equation depends on n and x0, so we can select some ﬁeld

On the other hand, for the ground state this condition can be viewed,
vice versa, as an equation to ﬁnd x0 for some given value of n [6]. Hereby we
reverse the order of the derivation, to simplify numerical calculations.

4 Discussion

In a physical context, the used adiabatic approximation implies that the
position of the nucleus is not ”ﬁxed” in the (r, ϕ) plane. Indeed, there is no
reason for the nucleus to stay ”exactly” at the center of the orbit when the
Coulomb force in the transverse plane is totally ignored.

In contrast,

in the z direction, we have more complicated situation,
namely, the magnetic ﬁeld leads to the eﬀective interaction potential C(z),
which is ﬁnite at z = 0 and is Coulomb-like in the long-range asymptotic.
Hence, the position of the nucleus remains to be ﬁxed in the z direction
relative to the orbit of the electron (bound state).

Due to the (crude) Coulomb approximation of Sect. 3.1.1, the electron
probability density of the hydrogen atom under very intense magnetic ﬁeld,
at n = 1, appears to be of rather nontrivial form schematically depicted in
Fig. 6.

More accurate approach may yield some diﬀerent electron charge distri-
butions but we expect that the symmetry requirements (namely, the axial
symmetry and the (anti)symmetry under inversion z
z) would lead again

are separated) similar to that shown in Fig. 6, or to an unsplitted one (the
two torii are superimposed) as shown in Fig. 8.

One can see from Fig. 13 that the peak of the ground state wave function
is at the point z = 0 (see also Fig. 14 for a close view) while the largest
000
|
peaks of the excited wave functions are away from the point z = 0 (as it
was expected to be). Consequently, the associated longitudinal probability
distributions (square modules of the wave functions multiplied by the volume
factor of the chosen coordinate system) are symmetric with respect to z

→
z, and their maxima are placed in the center z = 0 for the ground state,

−
and away from the center for the excited states.

In contrast to the double toroidal orbit (Fig. 6) implied by the Coulomb
approximation of Sect. 3.1.1, the modiﬁed Coulomb potential approach sug-
gests a single toroidal orbit (Fig. 8) for the ground state charge distribution
of the hydrogen atom. This conﬁrms Santilli’s study [2] of the hydrogen
atom in strong magnetic ﬁeld. The excited states
are characterized by

They calculated ﬁrst-order perturbative corrections to the above energies
and obtained the values, which are in a good agreement with the results by
Lai [4] (see Fig. 9) and Ruder et al. [1].

It is remarkable to note that in very strong magnetic ﬁeld, the energy
diﬀerences between the excited states and the ground state of the hydrogen
atom are small in comparison to the absolute value of the ground state energy.
The excited states are represented by the double torii conﬁgurations since
the peaks of the associated wave functions spread far away from the center
z = 0 in both +z and

z directions.

The above ground state electron charge distributions strongly support the
study made by Santilli [2] who proposed the polarized toroidal electron orbit
in the hydrogen atom under the action of strong magnetic ﬁeld as a physical
picture at the foundation of the new chemical species of magnecules. The
only addition to this picture is that the the excited states are characterized
by the double torii conﬁguration.

−

Since zero ﬁeld ground state case is characterized by perfect spherically
symmetric electron charge distribution of the hydrogen atom, intermediate
intensities of the magnetic ﬁeld are naturally expected to imply a distorted
spherical distribution. However, deeper analysis is required for the interme-
diate magnetic ﬁeld intensities because the adiabatic approximation is not
longer valid in this case. Namely, an interesting problem is to solve the
Schr¨odinger equation (3.1) for the case when intensity of the magnetic ﬁeld
is not very strong, B
B0, with the corresponding characteristic Landau
ground state energy of about the Bohr energy. In this case, both the Coulomb
and magnetic interactions should be taken at the same footing that leads to
complications in its analytic study.

As to the multi-electron atoms, an interesting problem is to study action
of a very strong external magnetic ﬁeld on He atom (see. e.g., Heyl and Hern-
quist [6] and Lai [4]; Fig. 15) and on the multi-electron heavy atoms, with
outer electrons characterized by a nonspherical charge distribution, such as
the p-electrons in Carbon atom, orbitals of which penetrate the orbitals of
inner electrons. Very intense magnetic ﬁeld would force such outer electrons
to follow small round Landau orbits.
In addition to the eﬀect of a direct
action of the magnetic ﬁeld on the inner electrons, a series of essential re-
arrangements of the whole electron structure of the atom seems to be occur
with a variation of the external magnetic ﬁeld strength. Indeed, the mag-
netic ﬁeld competes with both the Coulomb energy, which is diﬀerent for
diﬀerent states of electrons, and the electron-electron interactions, including
spin pairings. However, it is evident that at suﬃciently strong ﬁelds, all the
electron spins are aligned antiparallel to the magnetic ﬁeld — fully spin po-
larized conﬁguration — while at lower ﬁeld intensities various partial spin
polarized conﬁgurations are possible.

29

Figure 16: Contour plots of the (r, z) plane electron density of the iron atom
according to density matrix theory at two diﬀerent magnetic ﬁeld strengths,
1011 Gauss (left) and 1012 Gauss (right). The outermost contour encloses 99%
of the negative charge, the next 90%, then 80% etc., and the two innermost
5% and 1% respectively (reproduction of Fig. 5 by Johnsen and Yngvason
[5]).

In accord to the numerical calculations based on the density matrix the-
ory approach by Johnsen and Yngvason [5], which is in quite good agreement
with the result of Hartree-Fock approach at very strong magnetic ﬁeld inten-
sities, the inner domain in the iron atom (26 electrons) is characterized by
slightly distorted spherically symmetric distribution even at the intensities
as high as B = 100B0 . . . 1000B0. The outer domain appears to be of spe-
ciﬁc, highly elongated distribution along the direction of the magnetic ﬁeld
as shown in Fig. 16. The possible interpretation that the inner electrons re-
main to have spherical distribution while outer electrons undergo the squeeze
seems to be not correct unless the spin state of the iron atom is veriﬁed to
be partially polarized. So, we can conclude that all the electrons are in

30

→ −

highly magnetically polarized state (Landau state mixed a little by Coulomb
interaction), and the electron structure is a kind of Landau multi-electron
cylindrical shell, with spins of all the electrons being aligned antiparallel to
the magnetic ﬁeld (fully spin polarized conﬁguration).

Another remark regarding Fig. 16 is that the contours indicating nearly
spherical distribution will always appear since the Coulomb center (nucleus)
is not totally eliminated from the consideration (non-adiabatic approxima-
tion), and it forces a spherical distribution to some degree, which evidently
depends on the distance from the center (closer to the center, more spheric-
ity). We note that Fig. 16 is in qualitative agreement with Fig. 6 in the sense
that the predicted charge distribution reveals symmetry under the inversion
z

z, with the characteristic z-elongated toroidal orbits.

An exciting problem is to study H2 molecule under the action of strong
external static uniform magnetic ﬁeld using Schr¨odinger equation. Since the
binding energy of H2 molecule is of about 4.75 eV (much less than 13.6 eV of
individual hydrogen atoms) and two interacting electrons of spin 1/2 partic-
ipate dynamics we expect interesting physical predictions. For example, it
is interesting to analyze the problem of bonding, in the presence of a strong
magnetic ﬁeld.

However, before studying H2 molecule it would be very useful to investi-
gate much simpler two-center system, H +
2 ion, as it can give valuable infor-
mation on the features of a two-center system under the action of a strong
magnetic ﬁeld. We refer the interested reader to Refs. [4, 6] for details of
studies on H+
2 ion and H2 molecule in strong magnetic ﬁeld. Figure 17 dis-
plays ground and ﬁrst excited state wave functions of H +
2 ion calculated by
Heyl and Hernquist [6].

Finally, it should be noted that studies on the atomic and molecular
systems in strong magnetic ﬁelds and related issues are becoming extensive
last years. We refer the reader to a recent review by Lai [4] for an extensive
list of references, and below present summary of some selected recent papers.
[8] uses an orthogonal approach and
achieves very high precision by solving the general problem of the hydrogen
atom in an arbitrarily strong magnetic ﬁeld. This analytical work is of much
importance as it provides solid ground to analyze few-electron and multi-
electron atoms, and simple diatomic molecules.

The work by Kravchenko et al.

A series of papers by Schmelcher et al. [9] is devoted to a systematic study
of various simple atomic, ionic and molecular systems in strong magnetic

considers the carbon atom.

Analytical approximations have been constructed by Potekhin [10] for
binding energies, quantum mechanical sizes and oscillator strengths of main
radiative transitions of hydrogen atoms arbitrarily moving in magnetic ﬁelds
1012 . . . 1013 Gauss. This approach is of much importance in investigating

an interaction of highly magnetized hydrogen atoms in a gaseous phase.

Computational ﬁnite element method for time-dependent Schr¨odinger
equation has been developed by Watanabe and Tsukada [11] to study dynam-
ics of electrons in a magnetic ﬁeld that can be used eﬀectively for mesoscopic
systems, such as small clusters.

Abstract

Using the reduced density matrix formalism the time dependence of

the exciton scattering in light-harvesting ring systems of purple bacte-

ria is calculated. In contrast to the work of Kumble and Hochstrasser

(J. Chem. Phys. 109 (1998) 855) static disorder (ﬂuctuations of the

site energies) as well as dynamic disorder (dissipation) is taken into

account. For the description of dissipation we use Redﬁeld theory in

exciton eigenstates without secular approximation. This is shown to be
equivalent to the Markovian limit of ˇC´apek’s theory in local states. Cir-
cular aggregates with 18 pigments are studied to model the B850 ring

of bacteriochlorophyls within LH2 complexes. It can be demonstrated

that the dissipation is important for the time-dependent anisotropy of

the ﬂuorescence. Smaller values of static disorder are suﬃcient to pro-

duce the same decay rates in the anisotropy in comparison with the

results by Kumble and Hochstrasser.

1 Introduction

The physical motivation of the present paper is a growing interest in the exci-
ton transfer in the antenna systems (ASs) of the purple bacteria photosynthetic
units (PSUs). The light-harvesting complexes that are present in photosyn-
thetic systems perform two major functions: harvest (absorb) the incident
light and transport the energy in form of Frenkel excitons to the reaction cen-
ter (RC). Many investigations, both experimental and theoretical ones, have
been directed towards understanding of the exciton transfer in the ASs of pur-
ple bacteria PSUs and are reviewed in [1–3, and references therein]. Although
considerable progress has been made during recent years, our knowledge about
the mechanism of energy transfer and relaxation is still far from complete.

In 1995 the ﬁrst high-resolution three-dimensional X-ray structure of a bac-
terial antenna complex LH2 from Rhodopseudomonas acidophila was published
by Mc Dermott et al. [4,5]. It consists (see Fig. 2 in [5]) of nine identical units,
protomers, each of which is formed by two proteins (α and β) with bound bac-
teriochlorophyls (BChl). The nine α subunits are packed in an inner ring to
form a hollow cylinder of radius 1.8 nm. The 9 β subunits are arranged radially
outwards with respect to the α subunits to form another ring with a radius
of 3.4 nm. The protein serves as a scaﬀold for the BChls and furthermore
speciﬁcally inﬂuences the spectroscopic properties of the BChls by supplying
a characteristic environment for them. A ring with a radius of about 2.5 nm
of 18 BChl molecules is sandwiched between the α and β subunits.

The very symmetric arrangement with short distances between the pig-
ments provides a new impulse to the discussion about, e.g., the exciton trans-
fer regime and the exciton delocalization in LH2. The extent of the exciton
delocalization, which could be reduced by dynamic and static disorders, has
been discussed. The principal question reads: Are the states contributing to
the optical and transport properties of the LH2 ring localized or delocalized?
In the past knowledge of the energy transfer was mainly derived from steady
state spectroscopic experiments leading to several absorption bands at dif-
ferent wavelengths. Pigment molecules B850, that we are dealing with, are
characterized by the absorption wavelength in the LH2 subunits of the ASs
of purple bacteria. At room temperature the solvent and the protein environ-
ment ﬂuctuate with characteristic time scales ranging from femtoseconds to
nanoseconds. The dynamical aspects of the system are reﬂected in the line
shapes of the electronic transitions. To fully characterize the line shape of a
transition and thereby the dynamics of the system, one needs to know not
only the ﬂuctuation amplitude ∆ (coupling strength) but also the time scale
of each process involved. The observed linewidths reﬂect the combined inﬂu-
ence of static disorder and exciton coupling to intermolecular, intramolecular,
and solvent nuclear motions. The simplest approach is to decompose the line
proﬁle into homogeneous and inhomogeneous contributions. In more sophisti-
cated models, each process is deﬁned with its characteristic time scale as well
as a coupling strength [6–9].

3

Both the exciton-phonon coupling and the static disorder lead to local-
ization of excitons. One tries to avoid the inﬂuence either of the dynamical
disorder by measuring at very low temperatures or of the static disorder by
performing single-molecule spectroscopy experiments. The absorption, circu-
lar dichroism, and hole-burning spectra of the LH2 complex are reproduced
reasonably well by theoretical treatments, that consider Frenkel exciton states
of the entire complex but invoke moderate disorder in the excitation energies
of the individual BChls [1].

In a homogeneous system, in which the Qy transition dipole moments of the
B850 BChls all lie approximately in the plane of the ring, most of the dipole
strength of the B850 band would come from a degenerate pair of orthogonally
polarized transitions at an energy slightly higher than the transition energy
of the lowest exciton state. However, energetic or structural disorder that
disrupts the symmetry of the complex will make both the low-energy transition
and transitions at higher energies weakly allowed.

Time-dependent experiments (absorption, ﬂuorescence, photon echo, etc.),
which used (sub-)picosecond light pulses of low energy with high repetition
rate tunable through the infrared absorption bands of the various BChl pig-
ments in a variety of bacterial ASs, made it possible to study the long-time as
well as femtosecond dynamics of the energy transfer and relaxation [1, 10–14].
The nature of the rapid relaxation is of interest because it depends on how
photosynthetic antenna complexes absorb and transfer energy and because it
may provide an experimental window to protein dynamics on very short time
scales [15].

≈

The interpretation of time-dependent experiments on femtosecond time
scale requires a theory which incorporates both dynamic disorder and diﬀer-
ent kinds of static disorder. Recently, models based on extended exciton states
J/2 have found acceptance in the interpre-
with moderate static disorder ∆
tation of the experiments [10–14, 16–20] in which it has been shown that the
elementary dynamics occurs on a time scale of about 100 fs [15,21–23]. For the
ring of BChls in the LH2 antenna complex Kumble and Hochstrasser [24] has
presented a time-domain analysis of the eﬀects of local energy inhomogeneity
upon the dynamics of optical excitations. They examined the manifestation
of disorder scattering in polarized femtosecond spectroscopy and the degree to
which exciton delocalization is revealed in emission and transient absorption
anisotropy measurements. The time evolution of the quantum states, prepared
by impulsive excitation of a statically disordered circular aggregate model for
LH2 antenna complexes, have been calculated exactly quantum mechanically
for varying degrees of inhomogeneity (static disorder), but without taking into
account the interaction with a heat bath (dynamic disorder). For a Gaussian
distribution of local energies, the dynamics of coherence loss (scattering) has
been explored as a function of the ratio of the standard deviation ∆ of the dis-
tribution to the intersite interaction energy J. (Please note that Kumble and
Hochstrasser used the symbol σ for the standard deviation in their paper [24].)

cient to cause scattering on a sub-100 fs time scale. The estimate of static dis-
order emerging from this investigation should be considered as an upper limit.
By neglecting the inﬂuence of phonons, Kumble and Hochstrasser’s model does
not take into account the dynamic scattering eﬀects which contribute to de-
phasing of the initial wave packet state and which promote thermalization of
the dephased populations.

Nagarjan et al. [21] measured the changes in absorption and stimulated
emission caused by excitation with 35 fs pulses centered at 875 nm. Substan-
tial relaxation on the time scale of 10-100 fs and an anomalously large initial
anisotropy of 0.7 in the bleaching and stimulated-emission signal has been
observed. These results have been interpreted in the simple model of a homo-
geneous system in which excitations are delocalized over the whole ring. The
high initial anisotropy was ascribed to coherent excitation of a degenerate pair
of states with allowed transitions and the relaxations to electronic dephasing
and equilibration with states at lower energies which have forbidden transi-
tions. It has been shown in Ref. [15] that excitation of membrane-bound LH2
complexes with low-intensity femtosecond pulses causes changes in absorption
and stimulated emission that initially depend on the excitation wavelength but
relax to a quasi-equilibrium with a time constant of 100
20 fs. The signals
have an apparent initial anisotropy of approximately 0.5 when the complex
is excited with broadband pulses, and of 0.35-0.4 with narrower pulses. The
anisotropy decays to 0.1 with a time constant of about 30 fs.

±

Using a density-matrix formalism Nagarjan et al. [15] have shown that the
initial light-induced signals are consistent with coherent excitation of multiple
exciton levels in an inhomogeneous ensemble of LH2 complexes and that the
main features of the spectral relaxations and the anisotropy can be explained
by electronic dephasing and thermal equilibration within the manifold of ex-
citon levels. For one initial state three diﬀerent possibilities of the form of the
exciton density matrix ρ have been taken into account. Beside the full matrix
description, which has been represented as a coherent superposition of the al-
lowed ”one exciton” states, the second is obtained by setting the oﬀ-diagonal
terms of ρ to zero, which gives an incoherent mixture of one-exciton states
with the same initial populations. Finally, in the third form the diagonal el-
ements of ρ are replaced by the populations for a Boltzmann equilibrium at
temperature T (with the oﬀ-diagonal terms zero).

Nagarjan et al. [15] have discussed several diﬀerent processes which could
contribute to the spectral relaxations and the rapid decay of the anisotropy.
They concluded, that the main features of the spectral relaxations and the
decay of anisotropy are reproduced well by a model that considers decay pro-
cesses of electronic coherences within the manifold of the exciton states and
the thermal equilibration among excitonic states. They have not attempted to
calculate the dynamics theoretically. But the model described in [15] appears
capable of rationalizing the observation that the anisotropy decay is faster than
the spectral relaxation.

Moderate static disorder, which leads to electronic dephasing, causes a

5

≈

large decrease in the calculated anisotropy, whereas the relaxation of the over-
all signal occurs mainly during thermalization, because the two most strongly
allowed exciton states tend to be close together in energy and to have approx-
imately orthogonal transition dipoles. Nagarjan et al. [15] concluded that the
static inhomogeneity assumed in their LH2 model would cause the oﬀ-diagonal
terms ρab and ρba of the density matrix to decay with a time constant of the
order of 160 fs. This suggests that the more rapid dephasing indicated by the
anisotropy decay (τ

30 fs) is driven mainly by dynamic processes.

The aim of the present paper is to extend the investigation by Kumble
and Hochstrasser [24] and also by Nagarjan et al. [15] taking into account the
simultaneous inﬂuence of static and dynamic disorders on the exciton scat-
tering after impulse excitation and on the time-dependent optical anisotropy.
Diﬀerent time dependent spectroscopic properties have been calculated before
but within the secular approximation [25].

The remainder of this article is organized as follows: In the next section
we present the model we have used.
In section 3 several diﬀerent theories
giving the dynamical equations for the exciton density matrix are reviewed.
Our results are presented in section 4 and in the last section we discuss them
and draw some conclusions.

2.1 Hamiltonian of the ideal rings

In this paper we deal with just one exciton, already created at time t = 0, on a
ring interacting with a heat bath. The Hamiltonian therefore consists of three
parts:

The ﬁrst term is the Hamiltonian H 0

ideal ring. Operators a†
m or am create or annihilate an exciton at site m.
Jmn for m
= n is a transfer integral (also called resonance integral) between
sites m and n. The diagonal elements Jnn are the local energies ǫn at site n
= ǫ2n+1. The second
which could take into account, e.g., a dimerization ǫ2n 6
term, Hph, describes the phonons. We assume independent heat baths for
each chromophore and the harmonic approximation for the phonons. b†
q and
bq denote phonon creation and annihilation operators, respectively. The last
term, Hex−ph, represents the interaction between the exciton and the bath.
The exciton–phonon interaction is assumed to be site–diagonal and linear in
the lattice displacements. The term Gm
q denotes the exciton–phonon coupling
constant.

2.3 Microscopic parameters

tions gain strength at the expense of the low energy k =
1 transitions, which
dominate the spectrum of the ideal B850 ring. There is still a discrepancy
between the measurement by Freiberg et al. [11] and results of hole-burning
experiments by Small (see references in [1]). In the former experiments con-
siderable intensity of about 13% (averaged over a large ensemble) attained by
the lowest k = 0 transition has been revealed. In interpreting these experi-
ments it was concluded [11] that the shape of the linear absorption spectrum
0.7. The hole burning
of B850 at 8 K could be well reproduced by taking ∆
results at 4 K imply much smaller disorder leading to a relative intensity of
the k = 0 subband of only 3%. The model parameters obtained by Freiberg
from ﬁtting the simulated linear and nonlinear absorption spectra to the low
temperature experimental data are the transfer integrals J12 = 375 cm−1 and
30 cm−1 as well as the strength of the static disorder ∆ = 216 cm−1
J13 = 20
with FWHM = 507 cm−1. The dynamic disorder leads to a broadening of the
exciton levels E(k) with a FWHM = 58 cm−1 = J/6.5.

Novoderezhkin et al. [19, 20] ﬁtted the pump-probe spectra of the LH2
antenna. Taking into account the diﬀerence between the local BChl energies
∆ǫ = ǫ1 −
ǫ2 in the basic dimer which leads to the splitting of the exciton
energy band to two subbands, the following set of microscopic parameters :
the transfer integrals J12 = 400 cm−1, J23 = 290 cm−1, the the homogeneous
line widths of exciton states in the lower subband Γ1L = 240 cm−1 and in
the higher subband Γ1H = 340 cm−1 and the strength of the static disorder
∆ = 450 cm−1 has been used. Koolhaas et al. [14] have recently obtained the
transfer integrals J12 = 396 cm−1 and J23 = 300 cm−1.

In what follows we will use the transfer integral J12 as energy unit. We
ǫ2 = J12, and ∆ between 0.2 and 1. To convert
choose J23 = 0.7, ∆ǫ = ǫ1 −
the time τ in these units into seconds one has to divide τ by 2πcJ12 with c
the speed of light in cm/s and J12 in units of cm−1. So τ = 1 corresponds to
21.2 fs for J12 = 250 cm−1 and to 13.3 fs for J12 = 400 cm−1.

2.4 Nature of the initially prepared state

For a coplanar arrangement of site transition moments ~µn dipole-allowed tran-
sitions from the ground state populate only the degenerate k =
1 levels of
the ideal (without dynamic and static disorders) ring with Hamiltonian H 0

However, Kumble and Hochstrasser [24] concluded, that in the case of
pump-pulse excitation the dipole strength is simply redistributed among the
exciton levels due to disorder. So the amplitudes of site excitations and the
phase relationships in the initial state are necessarily identical to that of an
equal superposition of k =
1 excitons of the ideal ring. Thus, generally,
the excitation with a pump pulse of suﬃciently wide spectral bandwidth will
always prepare the same initial state, irrespective of the actual eigenstates
of the system. The nature of this initial state is entirely determined by the
selection rules of the unperturbed system.

2.5 Static disorder-induced scattering of the initially

pure state

Pump-probe and spontaneous emission measurements on the femtosecond time
scale have revealed ultrafast depolarization in the core and peripheral ASs with
biphasic kinetics: a fast sub-100 fs component and a slower decay on a 200-
400 fs time scale were observed in all cases [1]. Kumble and Hochstrasser [24]
thoroughly investigated the time dependence of the disorder-induced scattering

2.6 Consequences of the static disorder-induced scat-

tering in optical anisotropy measurements

Optical anisotropy measurements provide a convenient mean to follow experi-
mentally the decay of a virtual exciton within the LH2 ring. Since this initial
state is prepared as a superposition of eigenstates of the aggregate, polarized
pump-probe (or ﬂuorescence) signals contain contributions from interference
terms which last so long that the phase coherence between diﬀerent levels is
maintained. The decay of these cross terms directly reﬂects the time scale of
electronic dephasing. In the present case it therefore represents the survival
time of a virtual exciton within the disordered system.

In Kumble and Hochstrasser’s modeling, the decay of the initial state has
been directly manifested itself as a depolarization reducing the anisotropy from

Kumble and Hochstrasser supposed that equilibration between eigenstates of
0.1, but
the aggregate would lead to a further decrease of the anisotropy to
this process has not been considered in their paper [24]. They estimated, by
comparison of their results with experiment, that the static disorder in a LH2
0.8 which should be considered as an upper
ring has a value of ∆
limit since dynamic variations of the relative eigenstate energies occurring on
a 100 fs time scale would contribute to the scattering process.

2.7 Eﬀects of the dynamical disorder

As pointed out in Sec. 1 the aim of the present paper is to extend the above
described theory given in Ref. [24] by including the eﬀect of dynamic scattering
which contributes to dephasing of the initial wave packet and promotes a ther-
malization of the dephased populations. To deal with the dynamic disorder,
one works within the exciton density matrix formalism instead of using only
the exciton wave functions.

Taken only those terms into account which are directly connected to the
polarization the time-resolved ﬂuorescence Pif(ω, t) with initial ~ei and ﬁnal
polarization ~ef of the light is given (cf. Chapter 3, Eq. (2.58) in [27]) in our

We see, that the crucial quantity entering the time dependence of the
anisotropy is the exciton density matrix. In the next section we shall therefore
review several methods leading to dynamic equations for the exciton density
matrix which include microscopically the interaction of the exciton with the
bath. They could be obtained from, e.g., the general Tokuyama-Mori approach
only by serious approximations. One of them is the Redﬁeld model with and
without the so–called secular approximation [28,29], which has been applied to
exciton transfer and relaxation problems in AS rings several times. It has been
shown [30,31] that in contrast to the justiﬁcation of the secular approximation,
the non-secular terms do not average out in time.

Our result, presented in section 4, have therefore been obtained with the

Redﬁeld model without secular approximation.

3 Dynamic equations for the reduced exciton

density matrix

The bath–related relaxation can be described in a variety of ways. Among
others these are the path integral methods [32,33], the semigroup methods [34–
36], and the reduced density matrix (RDM) theory [37]. Here we concentrate
on the latter.

Having deﬁned the Hamiltonian H of the system, one exciton and a bath,
one has to solve the equations of motion for the complete density matrix σ,
namely the Liouville equation

i¯h

σ(t) = Lσ.

∂
∂t

(18)

This is not a simple task because one has to ﬁnd the time development of
all matrix elements of the density matrix - diagonal and oﬀ-diagonal - in any
representation which takes into account the exciton and phonon states.

Nevertheless, this treatment is not necessary in many cases. Information,
which is used in further investigations, is in many cases limited. For example,
the site occupation probabilities Pm(t) of the exciton (the diagonal matrix el-
ements in site representation after averaging over the bath variables) are in
many cases the most interesting quantities in theoretical investigations of the

12

exciton transfer. The transfer problem of, e.g. a Frenkel exciton interacting
with a bath, is usually treated by projecting out the bath degrees of free-
dom. This yields dynamic equations for the single-exciton density matrix ρ
complementing the usual single-exciton Liouville equation by terms describing
the bath inﬂuence. The latter terms must, on the other hand, be properly
parametrized.

3.1 Stochastic theories

In the stochastic treatment of the exciton interaction with the dynamic and
static disorders the inﬂuence of disorder is described by a stochastic process, i.e.
the interaction part of the microscopic Hamiltonian is replaced by a stochas-
tic time-dependent model Hamiltonian.
In the original version [38] of the
stochastic Liouville equation method (SLE) the bare exciton is inﬂuenced by
a stochastic ﬁeld

H2(t) =

hmn(t) a+

man.

m,n
X

(19)

Grover and Silbey [39] suggested that one could understand the excitation
in molecular aggregates also as a fully dressed exciton (polaron) obtained from
the microscopic Hamiltonian using a canonical transformation. The stochastic
ﬁeld acting on the dressed excitation has a diﬀerent microscopic meaning as
that one acting on the bare exciton [40]. The stochastic ﬁeld obtained from
the microscopic Hamiltonian for the local and linear exciton-phonon interac-
tion leads [40], in the bare exciton representation, mainly to local energy ﬂuc-
tuations while the corresponding stochastic ﬁeld acting on the polaron leads
mainly to ﬂuctuations of the renormalized transfer integrals.

The exciton-phonon interaction in the ring subunits LH1 and LH2 of the
purple bacteria should not be very strong [1]. Then the Hamiltonian H2(t)
models the inﬂuence of dynamic disorder mainly via ﬂuctuations of the local
exciton energies hmm(t). Mean values and correlation functions are given by

Multitime correlation functions entering the equations of motion can be cal-
culated from two-time correlation functions (20) according to diﬀerent rules.
Mostly dichotomic, Gaussian and white noise statistics have been applied in
the past.

The simplest description of the exciton dynamics in the framework of the
stochastic theories is obtained in the so-called white noise limit ∆2/λ

3.2 Redﬁeld theory

Provided that the excitation dynamics is not very fast, the coupling is rather
weak, the bath and the system are initially statistically independent, and ex-
cept for the initial time-interval t <
td (td = dephasing time of the bath), the
∼
approximate equation turns to the form ﬁrst derived by Redﬁeld [28, 29]:

, . . .
perhaps best presented in [37] or [45]. In the basis of eigenstates

Other elements of the Redﬁeld tensor cannot be given such a simple in-
terpretation. Keeping them as just ﬁtting semi-empirical parameters leads to
increases as N 4
technical complications as the total number of elements of
(N is the number of eigenstates involved, i.e. two for the dimer). Hence, the
which are physically less relevant provided
idea is to omit those elements of
that this omission does not appreciably inﬂuence the solution. That is why al-
ready Redﬁeld himself [28, 29] suggested the so–called secular approximation.
This approximation amounts to neglecting those elements of
that couple
elements of the density matrix ρµ′ν′ with incommensurate frequencies Eµν/¯h
determined in the ﬁrst term on the right hand side of (23). In other words, it
= Eµ′ν′. It has been shown [30,31] that
means to put Rµνµ′ν′ = 0 whenever Eµν 6
this approximation leads to non-physical eﬀects in the transfer processes and is
thus, in spite of its apparent success in many cases, physically not acceptable if
we discuss, e.g., relaxation among states other than eigenstates of the Hamil-
tonian of the system. Other approximations to the Redﬁeld theory, which have
not been applied here, have been used and tested in the context of electron
transfer [31, 46]. Aspects concerning the eﬃcient numerical implementation of
the Redﬁeld equation are discussed elsewhere [47].

R

Although being aware that Redﬁeld theory is limited to the high temper-
ature regime i.e. the system relaxation times have to be large compared to
the thermal time ¯h/(kbT ) we assume here here that this theory gives reason-
able results also at low temperatures. In the present study Redﬁeld theory is
applied to the full temperature range.

3.3 Generalizations of the HSR-SLE method in the local

representation

The original HSR-SLE method [38] represents the simplest stochastic treat-
ment of the microscopic interaction Hamiltonian, but the application of the
white noise is very restrictive. It leads to improper long time asymptotics of
the occupation probabilities of the extended exciton states Pk(
). Many at-
tempts have been made to determine more general equations using diﬀerent
representations of the exciton interacting with the bath and diﬀerent ways of
obtaining the dynamic equations for the exciton density matrix from the full
Hamiltonian (1). The equations obtained in such a way could, after some fur-
ther approximations and manipulations, be rewritten [48–50] in a form which
resembles the nonconvolutional SLE but brings several important improve-
ments.

ˇC´apek [48–50] applied several diﬀerent ways of obtaining of the convolu-
tional and convolutionless dynamical equations for the exciton density matrix.

4.1 Equivalence of Redﬁeld and ˇC´apek’s equations

We have used the dynamical equations of motion for the reduced exciton den-
sity matrix in the ˇC´apek’s form (25) and (26) to express the time dependence
of the optical properties of the model LH2 ring of BChls in the fs time range.
For linear local exciton-phonon coupling the Hamiltonian Hex−ph can be

written as

4.2 Disorder-induced scattering of the initial state

In the unperturbed ring the time evolution of a exciton in the presence of
static site energy and dynamic disorder leads to a loss of its coherent char-
acteristics, i.e., destruction of the phase relationships between the individual
eigenstates comprising the initial wave packet state. We have calculated the
time dependence of the occupation probability of the initial state after impul-
sive excitation, namely

Pk(t) = ρkk(t)

(45)

±

for an equal superposition of k =
1 states. In the basis of the unperturbed
system the time evolution can be described as scattering of the initially pre-
pared exciton into the levels to which it is coupled by the presence of disorder.
The scattering dynamics of a single ring after averaging over more than 1000
realizations of the static disorder ∆ is shown in Fig. 1 for four static disorders.
The inﬂuence of the dynamic disorder is displayed for diﬀerent temperatures
for three values of dissipation. The curves (i) with no dissipation do not
coincide with the corresponding results by Kumble and Hochstrasser, Fig. 2
in [24]. Their ﬁgures correspond to the time dependence of P+1(t) or P−1(t).
In Fig. 1 one can see a pronounced eﬀect of the dynamic disorder (curves (ii)
- (v)) on the disorder-induced scattering of the initial state, while the results
without dynamic disorder (the Redﬁeld tensor set to zero) (i) coincide with
those of Kumble and Hochstrasser [24] (when comparing the time dependence
of P+1(t) or P−1(t) with Fig. 2 in Ref. [24]). With dissipation the populations
equilibrate while without dissipation the populations ﬁrst decay rapidly but
then increase again. Without static and dynamic disorder this would lead to
full revivals. For short times some reminiscences of these revivals are seen if
one neglects dissipation. For low temperatures (cases (ii), (iv)), the dynamic
disorder leads to a further decay of the occupation probabilities P1,−1(t) after
an initial fast decay. Low temperature correspond to kBT /J12 = 0.001 i.e. for
J12 = 250 cm−1 the temperature is T = 0.36K. For room temperature the
inclusion of dynamic disorder leads to faster initial decay.

4.3 Consequences of the disorder-induced scattering in

optical anisotropy measurements

The time-dependent anisotropy (13) has been calculated for excitation pulses
polarized along the ex directions (~ei = ~ex ) and probe pulses which are polarized

19

along the ex and ey directions (~ef = ~ex and ~ef = ~ey). It is shown in Fig. 2.
Similar conclusions as for Fig. 1 can be drawn from Fig. 2. It was concluded in
Ref. [24] based on measurements by Chachisvilis et al. [51] that the time decay
of the anisotropy during the ﬁrst dozens of fs is temperature independent in the
case of LH2 subunits. Our calculation show that such result can be obtained
only for ∆ > 0.8. But because the time resolution of the experiments in [51]
was not too high this very restrictive statement about the strength of the static
disorder can only be made with caution. We expect that some temperature
dependence can be seen using experiments with shorter laser pulses.

5 Discussion and concluding remarks

We have used the LH2 ring structure of real antenna subunits of purple bac-
teria photosynthetic systems as a motivation for our investigation of the time
dependent optical spectra of our molecular aggregate ring model. In a series of
papers the steady state optical absorption line shape of the Frenkel excitons on
cyclic model oligomers have been calculated [6,7] in presence of both dynamic
and quasistatic disorders. Correlation with Freiberg’s experimental data gives
an estimate for the strength of the static disorder ∆ = 0.7 [52].

In the present investigation we study the time-dependent optical properties
under the inﬂuence of two simultaneous site energy ﬂuctuations - quasistatic
and dynamic within the LH2 ring antenna subunits of purple bacteria PSUs.
Despite a long history of experimental and theoretical investigations no ﬁnal
conclusion has been done on the ratio ∆/J12. Kumble and Hochstrasser con-
cluded to reach a decay in time-dependent optical experiments below 100 fs
0.8J12. They did not include dynamic disorder in their
one needs ∆
calculations. We have extended those calculations by including dissipation.
We were able to show that in this case smaller values of ∆/J12 are necessary
than predicted by Kumble and Hochstrasser.

Our investigation has been based on several simpliﬁcations:
A) The time development of the reduced exciton density matrix has been
described by the long time limit of ˇC´apek’s dynamical equations of motion
(Markovian limit). As shown in this paper ˇC´apek’s equations are equivalent
to the Redﬁeld equation without secular approximation. More precise descrip-
tion of the time development of the exciton density matrix during ﬁrst dozens
of fs requires certainly more advanced description with time dependent coeﬃ-
cients in Eq. (25) (non-Markovian treatment). We had discussed such results
obtained by us only for a dimer using diﬀerent methods for description of the
time development of the exciton density matrix [53]. In addition we have as-
sumed that Redﬁeld theory could give reasonable results for low temperature.
B) We have used the ring symmetry to describe the polarization proper-
ties of the Frenkel exciton states. Recent results obtained by single molecule
spectroscopy [54] can only be interpreted [55] admitting the presence of a C2
distortion of the ring. It has, up to now, not been concluded whether such

20

C2 distortion of the LH2 ring is present also in samples in vivo. Calculations
which take into account the possible C2 distortion of the ring are on the way.
C) Kumble and Hochstrasser have pointed out that the information needed
for a complete description of the exciton bath interaction is not available for
the LH2 units. We have worked with a form of the spectral density which has
been commonly used previously [1,25,45]. Work on a better description of the
exciton–phonon interaction model is in progress.

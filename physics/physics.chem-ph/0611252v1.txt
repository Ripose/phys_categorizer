What is the Time Scale of Random Sequential Adsorption?

(Dated: February 2, 2008)

A simple multiscale approach to the diﬀusion-driven adsorption from a solution to a solid surface is
presented. The model combines two important features of the adsorption process: (i) the kinetics of
the chemical reaction between adsorbing molecules and the surface; and (ii) geometrical constraints
on the surface made by molecules which are already adsorbed. The process (i) is modelled in a
diﬀusion-driven context, i.e. the conditional probability of adsorbing a molecule provided that the
molecule hits the surface is related to the macroscopic surface reaction rate. The geometrical con-
straint (ii) is modelled using random sequential adsorption (RSA), which is the sequential addition
of molecules at random positions on a surface; one attempt to attach a molecule is made per one
RSA simulation time step. By coupling RSA with the diﬀusion of molecules in the solution above the
surface the RSA simulation time step is related to the real physical time. The method is illustrated
on a model of chemisorption of reactive polymers to a virus surface.

Random sequential adsorption (RSA) is a classical
model of irreversible adsorption (e.g. chemisorption) [1].
Given a sequence of times tk, k = 1, 2, 3, . . . , an attempt
is made to attach one object (e.g. a molecule) to the sur-
face at each time point t = tk. If the attempt is successful
(i.e. if there is enough space on the surface to place the
molecule), the object is irreversibly adsorbed. It cannot
further move or leave the structure and it covers part of
the surface, preventing other objects from adsorbing in
its neighbourhood (e.g. by steric shielding in the molec-
ular context).

In the simplest form, RSA processes are formulated as
attempting to place one object per RSA time step, ex-
pressing the simulation time in units equal to the number
of RSA time steps k rather than in real physical time tk.
Such an approach is useful to compute the maximal (jam-
ming) coverage of the surface. To apply RSA models to
dynamical problems, it is necessary to relate the time of
the RSA simulation k and the real time tk. This is a goal
of this paper. We consider that the adsorbing objects are
molecules which can covalently attach to the binding sites
on the surface. We couple the RSA model with processes
in the solution above the surface to study the irreversible
tk−1)
adsorption of molecules in real time. The time (tk −
between the subsequent attempts to place a molecule is
in general a non-constant function of k which depends
on the kinetics of the chemical reaction between the ad-
sorbing molecules and the surface, and on the stochas-
tic reaction-diﬀusion processes in the solution above the
surface. We illustrate our method with an example of
the chemisorption of reactive polymers to a virus surface
[2, 3]. Finally, we show that the stochastic simulation
in the solution can be substituted by a suitable deter-
ministic partial diﬀerential equation which decreases the
computational intensity of the algorithm. We show that
it is possible to get the values of tk without doing exten-
sive additional stochastic simulations.

We consider a three-dimensional cuboid domain Lx ×

Lz in which molecules diﬀuse (see Fig. 1). The
Lx ×
Lx is assumed to be adsorb-
side z = 0 of area Lx ×
ing, i.e. containing binding sites to which molecules can
covalently attach. Our goal is to couple RSA on the
side z = 0 with stochastic reaction-diﬀusion processes
in the solution above the adsorbing surface. Since those
molecules which are far from the surface will have lit-
tle inﬂuence on the adsorbtion process, it is a waste of
resources to compute their trajectories. We will there-

fore carefully truncate our computational domain to that
which is eﬀectively inﬂuenced by the reactive boundary
at z = 0, which we denote by z < L(t). Note that L(t)
is not ﬁxed but a function of time—the formula for it
will be derived later. Suppose that there are N (t) dif-
L(t).
fusing molecules in the cuboid domain Lx ×
Let us denote the z-coordinate of the i-th molecule by
zi(t), treating molecules as points in the solution in what
follows. Choosing a time step ∆t, we compute zi(t + ∆t)
from zi(t), i = 1, . . . , N (t), by

where ξi is a normally distributed random variable with
zero mean and unit variance and Di is the diﬀusion con-
stant of the i-th molecule. In principle, we should model
the behaviour of molecules as three dimensional random
L(t), i.e. there

should be equations analogous to (1) for the x and y
coordinates too. However, we can often assume that

Lx in applications. Choosing the time step ∆t
large enough that a molecule travels over distances com-
parable to Lx during one time step, we can assume that
the molecules are eﬀectively well-mixed in the x and y
directions on this time scale. Consequently, the x and
y coordinates of molecules do not have to be simulated.
If the original adsorbing surface is large, one often mod-
els by RSA only a representative part of it, i.e. a square

molecules (1) is coupled with other processes in the so-
lution and on the surface as follows.
Chemical reactions in the solution: Our illustrative
example is the polymer coating of viruses [2, 3]. In this
case, the polymer molecules have reactive groups which
can covalently bind to the surface. The reactive groups
also hydrolyse in solution. Assuming that there is one
reactive group per polymer molecule (such a polymer is
called semitelechelic), we have eﬀectively one chemical
reaction in the solution - a removal of the reactive poly-
mers from the solution with rate λ [4]. Assuming that
λ∆t
1, the stochastic modelling of the process in the
solution is straightforward. At each time step, the i-th
molecule moves according to (1). We then generate a
random number ri uniformly distributed on the interval
[0, 1].
If ri < λ∆t, we remove the molecule from the
system. More complicated reaction mechanisms in the
solution can be treated using stochastic simulation algo-
rithms which have been proposed for reaction-diﬀusion
processes in the literature [5, 6, 7]. In our case, we treat
diﬀusion using the discretized version of Smoluchowski
equation (1). Consequently, we can follow Andrews and
Bray [5] to introduce higher-order reactions to the sys-
tem.
Adsorption to the surface: The surface Lx ×
Lx at
z = 0 is assumed to be adsorbing. We use a simple ver-
sion of the RSA model from [3] which postulates that the
binding sites on the surface lie on a rectangular lattice.
Binding a polymer to a lattice site prevents the bind-
ing of another polymer to the neighbouring lattice sites
through steric shielding, i.e. we consider RSA with the
nearest neighbour exclusion as a toy model of adsorp-
tion [1]. Such a RSA model can be simulated on its own
as shown in [3]. In this paper, we simulate it together
with the z-variables of molecules in the solution (1) to
get the RSA evolution in real physical time. Whenever
a molecule hits the boundary z = 0, it is adsorbed with
some probability, and reﬂected otherwise. This partially
adsorbing boundary condition is implemented in the RSA
context as follows:

(a) If zi(t+∆t) computed by (1) is negative then, with
probability P √∆t, we attempt one step of the RSA al-
gorithm with the i-th molecule. If the i-th molecule is
adsorbed, we remove it from the solution. Otherwise,
we put zi(t + ∆t) =

√2Di ∆t ξi.

we attempt one step of the RSA algorithm with the
i-th molecule.
If the i-th molecule is adsorbed, we

Here, P is a positive constant which can be related to
the rate constant of the chemical reaction between the
binding sites on the virus surface and the reactive groups
on the polymer [8]. This relation depends on the stochas-
tic model of diﬀusion and for equation (1) is given later
– see formula (6). Conditions (a)–(b) state that only
the fraction P √∆t of molecules which hit the boundary
have a chance to create a chemical bond (provided that
there is no steric shielding). Obviously, if zi(t + ∆t) com-
puted by (1) is negative, a molecule has hit the boundary.
This case is incorporated in (a). However, Andrews and
Bray [5] argue that there is a chance that a molecule
hit the boundary during the ﬁnite time step ∆t even if
zi(t + ∆t) computed by (1) is positive; that is, during the
time interval [t, t + ∆t] the molecule might have crossed
to zi negative and then crossed back to zi positive again.
They found that the probability that the molecule hit the
boundary z = 0 at least once during the time step ∆t is
exp[
0.
This formula is used in (b).

Numerical results: It is important to note that the
boundary conditions (a)–(b) can be used for any RSA
algorithm and for any set of reactions in the solution.
To apply it to the virus coating problem, we have to
specify some details of the model. First of all, it can be
estimated that the average distance between the bind-
ing sites is about 1 nm [2]. We choose Lx = 100 nm.
Therefore, there are about 10, 000 binding sites on the
adsorbing side z = 0. We use RSA on a 100
100 lattice
with the nearest neighbour exclusion, which is a special
case of the model from [3]. We consider a monodisperse

solution of semitelechelic 50 kDa polymers, i.e. Di ≡
10−5 mm2 s−1 [9]. The rate of hydrolysis

Since we simulate the behaviour of polymer molecules
in solution only along the z-direction, we express the
concentration of polymer c(z, t) in numbers of polymer

units of the “one-dimensional” concentration c(z, t) are

have to specify L(t) (see Fig. 1), i.e. we want to ﬁnd the
region of the space which is eﬀectively inﬂuenced by the
boundary condition at z = 0. To that end, we note that
the concentration c(z, t) satisﬁes the partial diﬀerential

Now any partially reacting boundary will have less im-

The results of the stochastic simulation of the solution
above the surface are shown in Fig. 2 as grey histograms.
To simulate the behaviour of N (t) reactive polymers, we
consider only their z-positions. We use ∆t = 10−2 s and

we update the z-positions of molecules during one time
step according to (1). At each time step, we also gen-
erate a uniformly distributed random number ri and we
remove the i-th molecule from the system if ri < λ ∆t.
We work in the one-dimensional domain [0, L(t)] where
L(t) is given by (5). The RSA boundary condition at
z = 0 is implemented using (a)–(b) described above.
The right boundary increases during one time step by
L(t). During each time step, we have
∆L(t) = L(t+∆t)
to put on average m(t) = c0 exp[

another approach to the problem, replacing the stochas-
tic simulation of the solution by the continuum limit (2)
with a suitable Robin boundary condition. To enable
a direct comparison of the two approaches, we use the
same sequence k1, k2, k3, . . . in ten realizations of the
full stochastic model of adsorption; the results are shown
as grey solid lines in Fig. 3.
RSA-PDE approach: Moving the right boundary L(t)

attempt to place the molecule is not successful, we put
αRSA(t) = 0. Thus αRSA(t) has only two values, 0 and 1,

the RSA-PDE approach. It also leads to the sequence of
real physical times tk1 , tk2 , tk3 . . . , of successful attempts
to place the polymer on the RSA lattice. The numerical
solution of equation (2) with the Robin boundary condi-
tion (6) at z = 0 is presented in Fig. 2 as the solid line
for comparison. We also plot the number of adsorbed
polymers as a function of the real time as the dashed line
in Fig. 3. To enable the direct comparison, we run the
RSA algorithm ﬁrst and we record the times of successful
attempts to place the polymer on the lattice. We obtain
the sequence k1, k2, k3, . . . of times expressed in number
of RSA time steps. This sequence is used in both the
stochastic model (10 realizations plotted in Fig. 3 as grey
solid lines) and the RSA-PDE approach (dashed line in
Fig. 3). The comparison of the results obtained by the
full stochastic model and by the RSA-PDE model is ex-
cellent.
Conclusion: We have presented a method to perform
RSA simulation in real physical time. The key part of
the method is the boundary condition (a)–(b) which can
be coupled with any reaction-diﬀusion model in the solu-
tion and any RSA algorithm. We illustrated this fact on
a simple model of the polymer coating of viruses. More-
over, we showed that the RSA algorithm can be coupled
with (2) using the Robin boundary condition (6) to get
comparable results. The Robin boundary condition (6)
is also not restricted to our illustrative example. It can
be used for the coupling of any RSA model with the PDE
model of the reaction-diﬀusion processes in the solution
above the adsorbing surface.

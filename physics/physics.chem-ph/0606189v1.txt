Abstract

An old classical one-particle helix model for optical activity, ﬁrst proposed by Drude, is recon-

sidered here. The quantum Drude model is very instructive because the optical activity can be

calculated analytically without further approximations apart from the Rosenfeld long wavelength

approximation. While it was generally believed that this model, when treated correctly, is optically

inactive, we show that it leads to optical activity when the motion of the particle is quantum me-

chanically treated. We also ﬁnd that optical activity arises even in the classical regime at non-zero

energy, while for zero energy the model is inactive, in accordance with previous results. The model

is compared with other one-electron models and it is shown that its predicted optical activity is

qualitatively diﬀerent from those of other one-electron systems. The vanishing of optical activity in

the classical zero-energy limit for the Drude model is due to the localization of the particle at the

equilibrium position, whereas in the analogous model of a particle moving freely on a helix without

a deﬁnite equilibrium position, optical activity does not vanish but the spectrum is rescaled. The

model under study leads to interesting predictions about the optical properties of e. g. helicene

derivatives.

INTRODUCTION

Optical activity is of enormous interest in chemistry, e. g. as an analytical tool to deter-

mine the absolute conﬁguration of chiral molecules by comparing experimentally obtained

optical rotatory dispersion spectra with calculated ones. Only recently quantum chemical ab

initio techniques provide sprectra of suﬃcient accuracy for that purpose [1, 2, 3, 4]. On the

other hand, due to their unique optical properties, chiral materials are of interest on their

own: Chiral materials belong to the larger class of bi-isotropic or, even more generally, bi-

anisotropic materials [5, 6, 7]. Especially interesting in this context [8] are materials whose

electric susceptibility and magnetic permeability are both negative in a given frequency

range. Meta-materials for the use in the microwave region consisting of helical structures

have been studied as promising candidates both experimentally [9, 10, 11] and theoretically

[12, 13, 14]. For applications working in the visible range, one has to pass to a molecular

level. There, quite diﬀerent classes of molecules with helical structure show strong optical

activity [15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21].

For the optimization of these properties, ab initio calculations are only of limited value as

they do not show explicitly the dependence of the properties on the variables of the system.

On the other hand many model systems [22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27] have been devised whose

optical activity can be calculated analytically as a function of their parameters.

In the following, we will be interested in modelling the optical activity of helical molecules.
An especially simple model, which can be solved analytically, is the one-electron model1 for

free motion on a helix as proposed by Tinoco and Woody [25].

It was applied [28] to

describe the ORD spectrum of hexahelicene [15], a helix shaped molecule built up of six

annellated benzene rings. The model assumed a box shaped potential, which is zero inside

the molecule and inﬁnite outside. However, this implied degeneracy of all positions inside the

molecule is questionable and instable with respect to perturbations. More recently, helicene

derivatives like helicenebisquinones [17, 18] and tetrathiahelicenes [19] have been shown to

have very large second order non-linear responses making them interesting materials for

non-linear optics. For these helicene derivatives, the assumption of free motion along the

helix cannot be justiﬁed any more. Maki and Persoons [29] instead have assumed that

1 It is important that the one-electron models studied in this article can be used to descibe also systems of

many electrons when these are treated as independent particles.

the electronic motion along the helix is controlled by an eﬀective harmonic potential. This

model probably is historically the ﬁrst,—it was proposed by Paul Drude [22] in 1900—, to

explain the phenomenon optical activity. Astonishingly, it has never been treated quantum

mechanically, probably because it was believed that the original classical model is optically

inactive. We will show, however, that this holds true only at zero energy.

Drude considered the motion of a single classical charged particle with charge e and mass

me constrained to move on a helical path so that x(t) = ρ cos φ(t), y(t) = ρ sin φ(t), and

z(t) = a/(2π)φ(t). Here ρ is the radius of the helix and a is the pitch (cf. ﬁg. 1). The helix

may be either right or left handed, depending on the sign of a. The motion of the particle

is governed by the harmonic Hamiltonian

with Ω being the frequency. The canonical momentum pφ(t) is

with the moment of inertia M = me(ρ2 + a2/(2π)2) and the vector x(t) = (x(t), y(t), z(t))T .

Drude considered the forced motion of the charged particle under the inﬂuence of the external

electric or magnetic ﬁelds of a polarized wave and calculated the resulting electric and

magnetic polarization. He found a rotation of the plane of polarization. In the following

3

it becomes important that Drude considered forced oscillations, only, and did not take into

account any free oscillations. Hence, the unperturbed system is frozen in at its equilibrium

position and has zero energy.

This model was used extensively in the years following its proposal to describe optical

rotation spectra although soon alternative many particle models, like the coupled oscillator

model, were propagated [30]. In 1933, however, Walther Kuhn [31] showed that the optical

activity of the helix model was an artifact due to a physically unjustiﬁed assumption made

by Drude who took only into account the electric (magnetic) moment parallel to the axis

induced by a magnetic (electric) ﬁeld component parallel to the axis, while it neglected the

electric (magnetic) moments perpendicular to the axis induced by a perpendicular magnetic

(electric) ﬁeld. We will speak in the following of the parallel and perpendicular component of

optical activity. So, while Drude only considered the parallel component of optical activity,

Kuhn showed that the parallel and perpendicular components of optical activities cancel in

an isotropic ensemble in the regime of classical mechanics at zero energy.

Some years afterwards, Condon, Altar and Eyring [24] presented an alternative quantum

mechanical one-particle model which was optically active. However, they made no attempt

to explain why the Drude model did not show optical activity. They found that in the

classical limit their model also shows optical activity, but failed to notice that this activity

vanishes at zero energy, too, because it is proportional to the mean quadratic displacement

from the equilibrium position of the particle.

The Drude model was then long forgotten until Desobry and Kabir [32] showed in the

seventies that the Drude model exhibits optical activity in the nonlinear regime. However,

they did not attempt to solve the Drude model quantum mechanically, neither did they

consider the behavior at ﬁnite energies.

For the related problem of free motion on a helix, Tinoco and Woody [25] already es-

tablished a non-vanishing optical activity in the quantum regime. While the latter model is

formally very similar to the Drude model, the two models’ behavior at low energies is quite

distinct as the particle will become localized at the equilibrium position in the Drude model

while there is no equilibrium position in the case of free motion.

The outline of this article is the following:

In sec. II we will determine the quantum mechanical expression for the rotational strength

of the Drude model which determines both the optical rotatory power and the circular

4

dichroism of the model.

In sec. III we will derive two expansions of the general result: In the ﬁrst case, we will
expand the optical activity into a series in ~ at zero energy. In the second case, we expand
into a series in E at ~ = 0, the classical limit. Furthermore, the optical activity of an

oriented sample of helices will be derived.

In sec. IV we will compare the optical activity of the Drude model with that of the model

of Condon, Altar, and Eyring on the one hand and that of the model of free motion on a

helix of Tinoco and Woody on the other.

Finally, a conclusion will be given in sec. V.

II. ROTATIONAL STRENGTH OF THE QUANTUM DRUDE MODEL.

To determine the optical activity of the Drude helix model we start from an expression

the eigen-frequencies of the system. The particle density is N1, the index of refraction is ˜n,

while ρn is a statistical weight. The operator of the electric and magnetic dipole moment,
respectively, is d = e x and m = e

p. The problem to determine of the

2mec L = e

optical activity thus reduces to the evaluation of the rotational strength Rmn. Addition

of an inﬁnitesimal imaginary part ω

ω + iǫ to the frequency in expression 3 removes

→

the singularities at ω = ωmn and at the same time, the rotation Φ acquires an imaginary

part upon this substitution which can be shown to correspond to the circular dichroism of
the transition from state n to state m. Using the well known formula limǫ→0(x + iǫ)−1 =
iπδ(x), where P(x−1) means the principal part, it is easy to show that the circular
P(x−1)

−

dichroism spectrum consists of lines centered at the frequencies ωmn.

The position of a particle on a helix is described by only one parameter φ. While in clas-

sical mechanics it is straightforward to ﬁnd the corresponding momentum pφ, in quantum

mechanics [34, 35] one has to specify much more carefully how the (approximate) restriction

to the one-dimensional sub-manifold,—in our case a helix—, is achieved before the corre-

sponding operators φ, pφ and their commutation relations can be found. For the special

5

case of the motion on a helix, there exists a very simple recipe [25] for quantization: it can
be shown that the operator pφ fulﬁlls a canonical commutation relation with φ, [pφ, φ] = ~
i ,
whence pφ = ~

∂
∂φ so that the hamiltonian 1 is easily quantized.
The position operator is formally identical to the classical expression,

The cartesian momentum operator p can be expressed by the time derivative of x, p = me ˙x.

As the general expression for the time derivative of an operator A depending only on φ but

not on pφ is

~[H, A] = 1/2

, we may derive an explicit expression for p and

Up to now, the form of the functions ψn/m(φ) or the dependence of ωmn on m and n was

not of relevance, whence we can use formula 9 to calculate not only the optical activity of

the Drude model but also e. g. that for free motion on a helix with given winding number

which should allow to reproduce the results of Tinoco and Woody [25]. In case of the Drude

model the states of the system are characterized by the single quantum number n so that

III. CLASSICAL AND LOW ENERGY LIMITS OF THE OPTICAL ACTIVITY

AND OPTICAL ACTIVITY OF ORIENTED HELICES.

We will now consider two limiting cases of that general expression. The ﬁrst one is the

classical limit. The second limit is the low energy limit in which only the ground state

(n = 0) is occupied. The combined classical and E = 0 limit was considered by Drude and
Kuhn and it is interesting to explore why and how the optical activity tends to zero with ~

and E.

In the classical limit, the quantum number n tends to inﬁnity as ~ tends to 0 while the

energy E is hold ﬁxed. Radiative transitions will only be observed between states with

7

6
quantum numbers n and m such that K is a small number. Hence, ∆E tends to zero and
Em to order O(~0). The classical
energy becomes a continuous function of time E = En ≈
motion will be periodic with period Ω. Furthermore, the observed transition frequencies

will become multiples of this fundamental frequency, ωmn =
KΩ, as is well known from
the correspondence principle [37]. We will eliminate ~ in favor of N and E from eq. 10,
~ = E/(NΩ).

±

In this limit (cf. ref. [38], eq. 22.15.2) the Laguerre polynomials approach Bessel functions,
N (x/N) = x−K/2JK(2√x). To apply the last formula to our problem we write

(13)

In the following, we will call Rmn alternatively RK(E, Ω). We are still not done in deriving
the classical limit of eq. 3 as this equation contains a pre-factor ~−1. In the classical limit,

always a large number of quantum states is occupied so that we have to specify the function

ρn. E. g. we may assume a micro-canonical distribution in which only states in a small
energy range from E to E + dE are occupied. For all n = E/(~Ω) in that range we have
ρn = ~Ω/dE. If both states n and m are inside the interval dE then, as Rm,n =

Rn,m, the

−

contribution of these states will cancel. Trivially, if both n and m are outside the interval,

Rmn = 0, too. Only the K states with n inside the interval and m outside (or vice versa)

will make a non-vanishing contribution so that

This formula will not only hold true in case of the harmonic oscillator. In general, Ω will

then be a function of E, too.

Expression 13 depends on E only in the combination E/(MΩ2) =

, which is the

mean quadratic ﬂuctuation of the angle φ. For small values of E, we may use the Taylor

expansion of the Bessel function to ﬁnd the expansion of RK(E) into a series in E. The ﬁrst
non-vanishing term in that series is of order O(E2),

correspondingly, there are three lines in the circular dichroism spectrum at ω = Ω, 2Ω, and

3Ω.

In experiments, probably the only distribution that may be realizable in an ensemble is

the canonical distribution ρn = exp(

βEn)/

m exp(

with β = 1/(kT ) where T is

the temperature. In the classical limit, where En becomes continuous, the transition from

the micro-canonical optical activity 16 to the canonical corresponds to a Laplace transform
which specializes to the replacement of E2 in eq. 16 by 2(kT )2. We see that the optical
activity will thaw up proportional to T 2

The second interesting limiting case is that of zero energy when all the systems are in their

ground states. The corresponding expression for the rotational strength R0m is considerably

simpler than the general expression 12, as LK
0 (x) = 1. We may expand this result into a
series in ~ to ﬁnd the lowest order correction to the classical optical activity from which we
already know that it vanishes. We ﬁnd that also the ﬁrst order correction in ~ vanishes, too.

The second order result reads

Again, the circular dichroism spectrum will consist in lowest order of three lines centered at

the fundamental frequency Ω and its ﬁrst and second harmonic.

We may compare this result to the prediction that would arise if we would start like

Drude from the physically unjustiﬁed approximation of considering the parallel component

(18)

This expression for the optical activity does not depend on ~ nor on E, furthermore, the

response of the system would always be linear for any strength of the driving ﬁeld.

We infer that at zero energy and in the linear and classical regime, the parallel and the

perpendicular components of optical activities cancel. When the extension of the wave-

functions increases, either due to quantum eﬀects, due to non-zero kinetic energy of the

unperturbed system, or when the ﬁeld strength is increased, the perpendicular response will

become an-harmonic and a net optical rotation will arise.

Kauzman [39] noted that a two electron system in which the electrons are correlated so

that their position φ diﬀers always by 180◦ will show a speciﬁc rotation as predicted by eq.

18. It is not diﬃcult to convince oneself that in this model the perpendicular responses of

the two electrons mutually cancel.

These considerations lead naturally to the consideration of the optical activity of an

oriented sample of helices. A nice example of such a system which has been studied experi-

mentally [17, 18] is a Langmuir-Blodgett ﬁlm composed of supramolecular arrays of helicene

As a sample of parallel oriented helices will be an uniaxial system, optical rotation will

only be observed, if the propagation vector of light is parallel to the axis of the helices. In

this case both the electric and magnetic ﬁeld will be perpendicular to the propagation vector

of light, so that one might expect that the optical activity is determined by the component

R⊥

mn. In fact, this is not entirely true, as there are also contributions [27] which are due to

interference of electric dipole transitions with electric quadrupole transitions so that

astonishing that e. g. the circular dichroism and the absorption are directly proportional to

each other with the proportionality constant being a measure of the chirality of the helices.

Furthermore, this result is independent of the potential seen by the charged particle, whence

it holds both for the Drude model and for the model of free motion on a helix. It would be

interesting to test this prediction for the helicene systems mentioned above [17, 18] for which

the classical Drude model has already proven usefull for the calculation of the second-order

optical response [29]. We also note that the optical activity will not vanish for an oriented

sample, not even in the classical limit at E = 0.

IV. COMPARISON WITH OTHER ONE-PARTICLE MODELS

We would like to compare the Drude model with two other one-particle models for optical

activity, the model of Condon, Altar, and Eyring on the one hand side and the model of free

motion on a helix with ﬁnite length on the other. As the quantum mechanical expression

for arbitrary quantum numbers is complex on the one hand but lacks speciﬁc features on

the other we will concentrate in our analysis on the classical and low energy limit.

The model of Condon, Altar, and Eyring assumes that the particle moves in a potential

of the form V = 1

A controls the strength of the cubic anharmonicity. Condon et al. did solve this model

quantum mechanically treating the cubic anharmonicity as a perturbation. They found that

may be expanded into a Taylor series of the assumed form around the equilibrium position

and as in the classical limit at small energies the motion of the particle will explore only

a small region around the equilibrium position, the response of generic classical systems at

low energies will be given by the result derived by Condon et al.

the particle will be nearly harmonic with the inﬂuence of the cubic anharmonicity, which is

responsible for the optical activity, becoming less and less important as energy is lowered.

This conclusion will not only hold true for isotropic samples but also for oriented systems

as for quantum motion within a potential quadratic in Cartesian co-ordinates, electric and

magnetic dipole (or electric quadrupole) transitions are never allowed simultaneously be-

tween any two states. This line of argumentation clearly will not hold for the motion being

restricted to the helical path as in the case of the Drude model as the potential is not an-

alytic. Although in the Drude model the motion along the helix is harmonic, electric and

magnetic dipole transitions are possible at the same time between two given states as the

co-ordinate φ does parameterize a curved path.

To understand the vanishing of the optical activity in the classical limit in case of the

Drude model we expand exp(iγφ), which appears in eq. 9, into a Taylor series. At zero

al., the vanishing of optical activity is due to the strong localization of the position of the

particle in the classical low energy limit. We saw already in the preceeding section when

discussing the original prediction of Drude that an ensemble of oriented helices will show

optical activity even in the classical zero-energy limit. Furthermore, we remark that, as in

the semiclassical low energy limit, the extension of the particle’s wavefunction will always

tend to zero, the use of the Rosenfeld long wavelength approximation will automatically be

justiﬁed.The free motion of a charged particle on a helix of ﬁnite extension is quite diﬀerent

in character from the two models just discussed, as, even in the combined classical and

low energy limit, the particle will not become localized as a unique equilibrium position

is lacking. Hence, we expect that optical activity will not vanish in the classical limit at

E = 0. The expression for the optical activity is more complicated than that of the Drude

model, as circular dichroism is not only to be expected at multiples of one frequency Ω

is of the form Rmn = MKΩf (E/(MK 2Ω2)). If we insert this into eq. 15 we notice that

and circular dichroism spectra will be invariant if ω is measured in units of Ω. The vanishing

of the optical activity in the models of Drude and Condon et al. is not paralleled by the

model of free motion on a helix.

V. CONCLUSION

In sec. II we derived a quantum mechanical expression for the optical rotatory strength of

the Drude helix model. The key result of this calculation is eq. 12. We found that the Drude

model is optical active in general, with exception of the classical limit at zero energy where

the optical activity vanishes. Incidentally, this was just the limit analyzed by Drude [22]

and Kuhn [31]. To understand better the reason why optical activity vanishes in that limit,

in sec. III we found an expression for the classical optical activity as a function of E (eq.
15). We found that optical activity thaws up like E2 in the classical limit, a behavior that

could have been predicted in principle already by Drude or Kuhn. Similarly, an expansion
of the general result in powers of ~ for E = 0 revealed that there are non-vanishing quantum
corrections of order ~2 to the classical behavior.

While in the general case, the circular dichroism spectrum will consist of lines at any

multiple of the fundamental frequency Ω, in both limits E

→
E = 0, respectively, only lines at frequencies ω = nΩ with n
[1, 2, 3] will be observed
in order E2 and ~2, respectively. We compared this result with the original (and wrong)

prediction due to Drude. He considered only part of the response of the helix to the external

applied ﬁeld, namely the components parallel to the axis of the helix, while neglecting the

perpendicular component. We observed that the parallel component of optical activity is
independent of both ~ and E and gives rise to a line in the circular dichroism spectrum at

13

the fundamental frequency Ω. On the other hand, the perpendicular component is strongly
dependent on E and ~ and will be anharmonic in general. Only in the classical limit and at

E = 0 the parallel and perpendicular component of optical activity will be of like magnitude

but opposite sign, so that the total optical activity vanishes.

We also consider the possibility to study separately the contribution of these two com-

ponents by taking into account an oriented sample of Drude helices as to be found e. g. in

Langmuir Blodgett ﬁlms of helicene derivatives [17, 18, 29]. These oriented samples form a

bi-anisotropic system. The only case where optical rotation will be observed occurs when

the light propagates parallel to the optical axis, which coincides with the axes of the helices.

We predicted that the optical activity will not vanish in that case even in the classical limit

at E = 0. Instead, the optical activity will become proportional to the oscillator strength

describing electric dipole transitions. Thus we conclude that the vanishing of the isotropic

optical activity in the classical limit at E = 0 is due to a delicate balance between the

individual optical activities for diﬀerent orientations of the axes.

In sec. IV we compared the Drude model with two other models describing one electron

optical activity, namely the models of Condon, Altar, and Eyring [24] on the one hand and

the model of Tinoco and Woody [25] on the other. While all three models are optically

active, they show qualitatively diﬀerent behavior, especially in the combined classical and

low energy limit. In that limit, the model of Condon et al. is generical for systems of one

electron moving in an analytical potential with unique equilibrium position. We found that

the vanishing of optical activity in that limit is also due to the localization of the particle

at the equilibrium position where it does not perceive the intrinsic chirality of the potential.

However, as this model is truly three dimensional, the optical activity vanishes proportional
to ~ and E while in the Drude model, with its one-dimensional potential which is not an
analytic function of x, optical activity vanishes like ~2 and E2. Finally, the model of Tinoco

and Woody, which describes the free motion of a particle on a helix, is qualitatively diﬀerent

from the other two models considered as there is no designated equilibrium position. We

found that due to this diﬀerence in the classical limit the spectrum does not vanish as a

function of E but remains invariant if the frequency is measured in units of the natural

14

frequency of the system, Ω(E), which itself is proportional to √E.

The generalized Lin-Taylor model deﬁned on the hexagonal lattice is used to investigate the phase separation in an asymmetric binary
liquid mixture consisting of large A (hexagons) and small B (triangles) particles. By considering interaction energies between A-A
and A-B pairs of particles that occupy nearest-neighbour cells of the hexagonal lattice, we have derived an exact solution for the
considered model system having established a mapping correspondence with the two-dimensional Ising model on its dual triangular
lattice. Altogether, six diﬀerent types of coexistence curves including those with reentrant miscibility regions (i.e. closed-loop coexistence
curves) were found in dependence on the relative strength between both coupling constants.

Keywords: binary mixture; phase separation; Lin-Taylor model; reentrant miscibility.

1 Introduction

Phase equilibria of binary liquid mixtures are subject of immense research interest since closed loops
of immiscibility were experimentally observed in the nicotine-water mixture (1) and later on, in several
aqueous solutions of the 1-, 2-, 3- and 4-methylpiperidine (2; 3; 4), α- and β-picoline (5; 6; 7), 2,4-
and 2,6-dimethylpyridine (4; 8), the glycerol-guaiacol mixture (9), and also in many polymeric blends
(10). It is noteworthy that an existence of the closed-loop coexistence curves with both upper (TU) as
well as lower (TL) critical solution temperatures evidently contradicts with intuitive expectations based on
thermodynamical description of demixing, which predicts, on the contrary, a bell-shaped coexistence curve
terminating at a single TU instead of having an island of immiscibility. Early explanation of this remarkable
and rather unexpected phenomenon has been suggested by Hirschfelder, Stevenson and Eyring (11) who
associated an appearance of the reentrant miscibility with a presence of highly orientation-dependent
forces, such as hydrogen bonding, which becomes rather ineﬃcient above a certain critical temperature. In
addition, if directional bonding occurs between like as well as unlike particles and the sum of interaction
energies for pairs of like particles is simultaneously greater than for pairs of unlike particles, the binary
mixture may even phase separate at low temperatures to yield an usual bell-shaped coexistence curve
with the low-temperature TU below an additional closed loop. Although one meets with such an intriguing
situation rather rarely because freezing transitions usually camouﬂage the lowest TU, the aqueous solution
of 2-butanol provides a striking example of the binary mixture with the closed loop above the bell-shaped
coexistence curve (12; 13; 14).

So far, diﬀerent lattice models of liquid mixtures have been proposed and dealt with in order to bring
an insight into a reentrant miscibility phenomenon (10). Even though all lattice models provide somewhat
oversimpliﬁed picture of the liquid mixtures, some of the lattice models have already proved their worth due
to their capability to explain the reentrant miscibility of hydrogen-bonded liquid mixtures (15; 16; 17).

Besides, there even exist few exactly solvable lattice models, such as Frenkel-Louis model (18) or Lin-
Taylor model (LTM) (19; 20), which give qualitatively correct results for a phase separation without
being aﬀected by any crude approximation. Here, we shall treat one particular example of LTM recently
remarkably generalized by Romero-Enrique and co-workers (21; 22; 23; 24; 25). Among other matters, the
generalized LTM has proved its usefulness in elucidating the reentrant miscibility as it has provided a
plausible explanation of its microscopic origin. Even if the procedure worked out previously by Romero-
Enrique et al. (22) is rather general and contains our version of the model only as a special case, the
numerical results reported on previously were mostly restricted to LTM on a square lattice, which is a
rather exceptional case of the self-dual lattice. In the present work, we shall therefore explore the phase
separation in the binary mixture of large hexagonal particles and small triangular ones, which are allowed
to occupy basic unit cells of the hexagonal lattice. As we shall see hereafter, this model also exhibits the
same substantial diversity of phase diagrams as remarked by Romero-Enrique and co-workers (22) and all
available scenarios for coexistence curves including those with a closed loop of immiscibility will be indeed
conﬁrmed.

The organization of this paper is as follows. The foundations of the generalized LTM on the hexagonal
lattice and basic steps of the exact method are given in the section 2. Section 3 deals with the most inter-
esting numerical results obtained for the phase diagrams and coexistence curves. Finally, some conclusions
are mentioned in the section 4.

2 Generalized Lin-Taylor model (LTM)

Let us begin by recalling foundations of the generalized LTM on the hexagonal lattice. Assuming that the
binary mixture consists of two kind of species, the large hexagonal particles A and the small triangular
ones B, LTM on the hexagonal lattice can be deﬁned through the following rules: (i) each hexagonal unit
cell consists of six triangular sub-units; (ii) none of A-A and A-B pairs can occupy the same hexagon; (iii)
the small particles B can occupy the cells left empty by the large particles A; (iv) each triangular sub-
unit can be occupied by at most one particle B; (v) pairwise interactions εAA and εAB exist between the
nearest-neighbouring A-A and A-B pairs sharing a common edge (Fig. 1). Next, we shall refer to µA and
µB as to the chemical potentials relative to the particles A and B, respectively. For further convenience,
let us also deﬁne fugacities of both the particles by

zA,B = exp(βµA,B),

where β = 1/(kBT ), kB is Boltzmann’s constant and T absolute temperature. The grand-canonical parti-
tion function of this binary liquid mixture can be written in the form of a sum taken over all occupation

Above, ni = 1, 0 labels occupation number of the basic unit cell (hexagon), whereas ni = 1 if ith hexagon
is occupied by the large particle A, otherwise ni = 0. The summation
Pi runs over all basic unit cells of
the hexagonal lattice and the other one
P(i,j) is performed over all pairs of nearest-neighbour unit cells. If
the conﬁguration of large hexagonal particles A is ﬁxed, the grand-canonical partition function ΞB(

of the small particles B can be expressed as follows

Here, MF (MI) denotes the total number of triangular sub-units available for occupancy to the small
particles B, which have (not) a common edge with the large particles A. When taking into account the

where N labels the total number of the lattice cells (hexagons). At this stage, the grand-canonical partition
function of the binary mixture can be mapped onto an one-component lattice-gas model for the species A

The equality (6) proves that the grand-canonical partition function can be calculated from the equiva-

establishes a mapping relationship between the model under investigation and the spin- 1

on the dual triangular lattice. As a consequence of this, the grand-canonical partition function can be
expressed through the partition function of the Ising model on the triangular lattice

It is worthwhile to remark that only the requirement of zero eﬀective ﬁeld (H = 0) in the equivalent
Ising model ensures a possible existence of the phase separation in the considered LTM. As a result, the
necessary (but not suﬃcient) condition allocating the coexistence region between two phases of diﬀerent
composition relates two fugacities of the large and small particles through zA = e3βεAA(1 + zB)6.

Notice that the mapping relation (8) represents a central result of our calculation as it formally completes
an exact solution for the grand-canonical partition function Ξ with regard to the known exact result of the
partition function of the triangular Ising model (26; 27). Besides, this relationship can readily be utilized
for calculating the number density of the large (nA) and small (nB) particles by relating them to the
magnetization per site (mtriang) and the internal energy per site (utriang) of the corresponding Ising model
on the triangular lattice (26; 27; 28). After straightforward calculation one actually ﬁnds

2.1 Coexistence region

In order to describe the phase separation into two phases of diﬀerent composition, let us ﬁrstly express the
fugacity and pressure as a function of temperature, the interaction parameters εAA, εAB and the eﬀective
coupling R. According to the equation (9), the fugacity of small particles B can be calculated from

Experimental conditions under which coexistence curves are usually observed meet the requirement of
constant pressure. In this respect, the equation (16) can serve for determining the eﬀective coupling
parameter R by selecting T , εAA and εAB at ﬁxed value of pressure. A subsequent substitution of the
eﬀective coupling R into the equation (15) then enables a simple calculation of the fugacities (the fugacity
of large particles is connected to the one of small particles due to an unconditional validity of the zero-ﬁeld
condition). With all this in mind, the composition of binary liquid mixture can be consequently calculated
using the set of equations (11)-(13).

2.2 Critical behaviour

According to the mapping relation (8), the binary mixture becomes critical if, and only if, the eﬀective
coupling parameter of the associated Ising model approaches its critical value. Owing to this fact, the
critical points can be found from this simple equation

3 Results and Discussion

In this part, we shall brieﬂy discuss the most interesting results obtained for the phase diagrams and
coexistence curves of the generalized LTM on the hexagonal lattice. It is worthy to mention that the
displayed coexistence curves are obtained by cutting concentration-temperature slices at ﬁxed pressure, i.e.
a situation which fully corresponds experimental conditions by performing studies of the phase separation.
It directly follows from the equation (15) that the phase separation into A-rich and B-rich phases might in
principle appear either if εAA > 0, εAB/εAA > 0.5, or εAA < 0 (arbitrary εAB). In what follows, we shall
treat those special cases in several sub-sections.

3.1 Repulsive interaction εAA > 0

If the pair interaction between the particles A is repulsive, the coexistence then possibly occurs just as
the interaction between the A-B pairs is likewise repulsive and simultaneously, the repulsion energy εAB is
stronger than a half of the repulsion energy εAA, i.e. εAB/εAA > 0.5. The phase diagram for this particular
pc dependence. The region inherent to the coexistence
case is depicted in Fig. 2a in the form of Tc −
of the A-rich and B-rich phases can be located above the displayed curves, while below them both the
components become perfectly miscible. It is quite obvious from Fig. 2a that the phase separation occurs
only above a certain boundary pressure pb/εAA = 3, which is needed for overcoming the repulsive force
between the pairs of particles A. On the other hand, the mixture becomes perfectly miscible independently
of the ratio εAB/εAA below this pressure value. It can be also readily understood from Fig. 2a that the
stronger the repulsion energy between the A-B pairs, which means, the stronger the ratio εAB/εAA, the
higher the critical temperature at which the phase coexistence disappears at a given pressure. Next, the
lines depicted in Fig. 3a illustrate changes of the critical concentration X c
A along the critical lines from Fig.
2a. As one can see, the critical concentration achieves X c
6 regardless of εAB/εAA when approaching
the lowest pressure pb at which the phase separation appears. For completeness, three typical coexistence
curves are shown in Fig. 4a for εAB/εAA = 1 ﬁxed and several values of pressure. As it can be clearly seen,
one ﬁnds the typical bell-shaped coexistence curves irrespective of the pressure strength.

A = 1

3.2 Attractive interaction εAA < 0

Now, let us examine the case when the pairwise interaction between the particles A is attractive. In such
a case one encounters much more complex phase diagrams and also much richer critical behaviour. For
better orientation, we have divided our discussion into several parts dealing with some typical cases.

εAB > 0. In this case, the repulsive interaction between the A-B pairs favours the phase separation
3.2.1
into A-rich and B-rich phases and as a consequence of this, one ﬁnds a quite similar phase diagram and
coexistence curves as discussed in above (compare Fig. 2b with 2a). The most signiﬁcant diﬀerence consists
in an appearance of a special critical end point with coordinates [kBT ∗
, p∗
] = [0.910, 0.051],
εAA|
c/

which is labelled by a star symbol in Figs. 2b)-d). While for pressures greater than p∗
c the critical tem-
perature monotonically increases as pressure rises, below the pressure p∗
c there is a coexistence but no
criticality. This observation would suggest that the critical end point terminates at a liquid-vapour coexis-
tence line of the pure A component. Actually, the mixture becomes pure A before it turns critical for any
pressure lower than p∗
c. This fact can be clearly seen also from Fig. 3b, where the critical concentration

is plotted against the critical temperature and all lines start from the same critical temperature of the
pure A component (X c
A = 1). For illustration, we depict in Fig. 4b three typical coexistence curves that
obviously exhibit much more pronounced asymmetry than those discussed formerly for the case with the
repulsive interaction εAA. Apparently, this asymmetry is the more evident, the lower and the closer is
pressure selected to its critical value p∗
c, since the initially B-rich phase looses at low pressures much more
rapidly its B component than the A-rich phase is enriched by the particles B.

3.2.2 −0.5 < εAB/|εAA| < 0. Contrary to the aforedescribed behaviour, it is easy to understand from
Fig. 2c that a weak attractive force between the A-B pairs leads to a monotonous decrease of the critical
temperature when increasing the pressure strength. The standard bell-shaped coexistence curves, which
are plotted in Fig. 4c for one particular ratio εAB/
0.3 and several values of pressure, provide
εAA|
|
a strong support for this statement. According to these plots and also dependences drawn in Fig. 3c, a
suppression of the critical concentration X c
A in response to a pressure strengthening is observed due to a
change of the character of the interaction energy εAB. This rather easily understandable behaviour survives
unless the ratio between both coupling constants does not reach the value εAB/
0.431. Within

the usual bell-shaped coexistence curves with single TU should be expected, the coexistence
curves with three consecutive critical points (TU, TL, and TU) and reentrant miscibility should emerge
for any pressure from inside the interval bounded by pmin
. Fig. 4d illustrates such example of a
closed loop above a bell-shaped coexistence curve with in total three critical points obtained at pressure
p/
= 0.5. If pressure
εAA|

is selected suﬃciently close but still below pmin
, the ’hour-glass’ coexistence curve can be even detected;
temperature induces after initial increase of mutual solubility its decrement until a repeated increase of
solubility near TU re-appears, as it is clearly depicted for the particular case p/
= 1.0. It is worthwhile

as diamond) by selecting the lower bound pmin
for pressure. Notice that the double critical points as well as
the critical double point can be characterized by a doubling of the critical exponents as it has been proved
previously (23). However, the most peculiar critical point [kBT ip

0.5. Under these circumstances, the coexistence region can

closed loop of immiscibility whenever pressure is selected above p∗
corresponding

to the double critical point. Namely, the miscibility gap ∆ = TU −
strengthening until it vanishes at the double critical points where TU and TL merge together. This scenario
can be clearly seen from Fig. 4e, where the closed-loop coexistence curves are plotted for three diﬀerent
pressures and the ratio εAB/
1. It is quite apparent from this ﬁgure that the stronger the

pressure, the smaller the miscibility gap (coexistence region). Note furthermore that there even exists
another possible scenario to have a coexistence without criticality at TU when selecting pressure below

= 0.051. In such a case, the temperature induces a phase separation at TL, nevertheless, both
εAA|

separated phases become pure A before the mixture turns critical and hence, one observes two pure phases
of particles A in coexistence that merely diﬀer in their densities. This observation can be interpreted as
a liquid-vapour phase separation of the pure A component, which takes place because the component B
vapourises prior to achieving the critical temperature when pressure is selected below its critical value p∗
c.

4 Conclusion

The present article deals with the investigation of phase separation in an asymmetric binary liquid mixture
of large hexagonal and small triangular particles described by means of the generalized LTM on the
hexagonal lattice. Despite its simplicity and a certain oversimpliﬁcation, this model is relevant as it provides
deeper understanding of the phase separation phenomenon without making any further approximation to
the results obtained. In addition, this model proves an existence of the closed loops of immiscibility
occurring under certain conditions either separately, or above the standard bell-shaped coexistence curves.
The closed-loop coexistence curve bounded by two critical points TU and TL indicates such a kind of
the reentrant miscibility, where TL determines an upper critical temperature under which two components
become repeatedly perfectly miscible. On the other hand, the reentrant miscibility can also be found in the
closed loop plus bell-shaped coexistence curve with in total three critical points; the region of reentrant
miscibility then occurs in between TL of the closed loop and TU of the bell-shaped coexistence curve.
Altogether, six possible scenarios for the phase separation were illustrated with the help of exact results
for the phase diagrams and coexistence curves: the standard bell-shaped curve with TU, the bell-shaped
curve without TU, the bell-shaped curve plus closed loop with two TU and one TL, the closed-loop curve
with TU and TL, the ’hour-glass’ curve with TU, and the closed loop with TL but without TU.

The main objective of the present work was to provide an eventual conﬁrmation of the aforementioned
coexistence scenarios, which were originally envisaged by Romero-Enrique and co-workers after introducing
and exploring the generalized LTM (22). It should be pointed out, however, that the majority of numerical
results reported on hitherto were mostly restricted to the particular case of the generalized LTM on the
square lattice. From this point of view, the investigation of LTM on the hexagonal lattice is of a particular
importance, because this model even has more obvious relevance to the phase separation of real binary
liquid mixtures which might consist of molecules with a hexagonal symmetry (like benzene, cyclohexane
and a large number of their structural and heterocyclic derivatives) and smaller non-linear molecules of
the solvent (like acetone, isopropanol, ethyleneoxide, ethers, dimethylsulfoxide, etc.). Our next eﬀort is to
provide a further extension to the model under consideration to account also for multiparticle interactions
and to elucidate a role of the size of solvent on the mutual solubility.

Fig. 1 One among possible conﬁgurations of particles within LTM on the hexagonal lattice. Large grey hexagons
denote lattice positions of the particles A, small black triangles positions of the particles B. The inter-
actions are considered only between A-A and A-B pairs of nearest neighbours, which share a common
edge (point contacts are neglected).

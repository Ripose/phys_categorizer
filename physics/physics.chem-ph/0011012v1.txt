Abstract

A theoretical model of nuclear spin conversion in molecules controlled by an

external electromagnetic radiation resonant to rotational transition has been

developed. It has been shown that one can produce an enrichment of spin

isomers and inﬂuence their conversion rates in two ways, through coherences

and through level population change induced by radiation. Inﬂuence of con-

version is ranged from signiﬁcant speed up to almost complete inhibition of

the process by proper choice of frequency and intensity of the external ﬁeld.

I. INTRODUCTION

It is well known that many symmetrical molecules exist in Nature only in the form

of nuclear spin isomers [1]. Spin isomers are important for fundamental science and have

various applications. They can serve as spin labels, inﬂuence chemical reactions [2,3], or

tremendously enhance NMR signals [4,5]. Progress in the spin isomers study depends heavily

on available methods for isomer enrichment. Although this ﬁeld has been signiﬁcantly

advanced recently (see the review in [6]), one needs more eﬃcient enrichment methods.

Recently two enrichment methods based on optically induced change of molecular level

populations have been proposed [7,8]. The purpose of the present paper is to investigate the

isomer enrichment caused by optically induced coherences in the molecule.

II. QUANTUM RELAXATION

Nuclear spin isomers of molecules were discovered in the late 1920s. The most known

example is the isomers of H2. These isomers have diﬀerent total spin of the two hydrogen

nuclei, I = 1 for ortho molecules and I = 0 for para molecules. Symmetrical polyatomic

molecules have nuclear spin isomers too. For example, CH3F can be in ortho, or in para state

depending on the total spin of three hydrogen nuclei equal 3/2, or 1/2, respectively (see,

e.g., [1]). Diﬀerent spin isomers are often distinguished also by their rotational quantum

numbers. Consequently, all rotational states of the molecule are separated into nondegen-

erate subspaces of diﬀerent spin states. Schematically, these subspaces for the case of two

spin states, ortho and para, are presented in Fig. 1. (For a moment, an optical excitation

shown in the ortho space has to be omitted.)

Nuclear spin conversion can be produced by collisions with magnetic particles. This is

a well-known mechanism for the conversion of hydrogen imbedded in paramagnetic oxygen

[9]. If a molecule is surrounded by nonmagnetic particles, collisions alone cannot change the

molecular spin state. In this case the spin conversion is governed by quantum relaxation

which can be qualitatively described as follows. Let us split the molecular Hamiltonian into

two parts,

ˆH = ˆH0 + ¯h ˆV ,

(1)

2

where ˆH0 is the main term which has the ortho and para states as the eigen states (states
in Fig. 1); ˆV is a small intramolecular perturbation able to mix the ortho and para states.

Suppose that the test molecule was placed initially in the ortho subspace. Due to colli-

sions the molecule starts undergo fast rotational relaxation inside the ortho subspace. This

running up and down along the ortho ladder proceeds until the molecule reaches the ortho
state m which is mixed with the para state k by the intramolecular perturbation ˆV . Then,
during the free ﬂight just after this collision, the perturbation ˆV mixes the para state k with

the ortho state m. Consequently, the next collision can move the molecule to other para

states and thus localize it inside the para subspace. Such mechanism of spin conversion was

proposed in the theoretical paper [10] (see also [11]).

Relevance of the described mechanism to actual spin conversion in molecules is not at
all obvious. The problem is that the intramolecular perturbations, ˆV , able to mix ortho and
para states are very weak. They have the order of 10 − 100 kHz (hyperﬁne interactions)
which should be compared with other much stronger interactions in molecules, or with gas

collisions. Nevertheless, the experimental and theoretical proves have been obtained that

spin conversion in molecules is indeed governed by quantum relaxation [6,12–14]. Although,

only three molecules (CH3F, H2CO and C2H4) have been studied in this context so far, it

is very probable that spin conversion in other polyatomic molecules of similar complexity is

governed by quantum relaxation too. It is useful for the following to give a few examples of

spin conversion rates. Most studied is the spin conversion in 13CH3F which has the rate,

γ13/P = (12.2 ± 0.6) · 10−3 s−1/Torr,

(2)

in case of pure CH3F gas [6]. Spin conversion in another isotope modiﬁcation, 12CH3F, is by

almost two orders of magnitude slower [6]. Similar slow conversion was observed in ethylene,

13CCH4, [13],

γeth/P = (5.2 ± 0.8) · 10−4 s−1/Torr.

(3)

These data show that spin conversion by quantum relaxation is on 9−11 orders of magnitude
slower than the rotational relaxation, ν ∼ 106 − 107 s−1/Torr.

III. OPTICAL EXCITATION

In this section we will analyze the spin conversion by quantum relaxation in the presence

of a resonant electromagnetic radiation. The level scheme is shown in Fig. 1.

In order

to reveal the main features of the phenomenon we will consider the process in a simplest

arrangement. First of all, we assume that molecular states are nondegenerate and that
only one ortho-para level pair, m − k, is mixed by the intramolecular perturbation, ˆV .
Monochromatic radiation is chosen to be in resonance with the rotational transition m − n.
In this arrangement the molecular Hamiltonian reads,

ˆH = ˆH0 + ¯h ˆG + ¯h ˆV .

New term, ˆG, describes the molecular interaction with the radiation,

ˆG = −(E0

ˆd/¯h) cos ωLt,

(4)

(5)

where E0 and ωL are the amplitude and frequency of the electromagnetic wave; ˆd is the

operator of the molecular electric dipole moment. We have neglected molecular motion in
the operator ˆG because homogeneous linewidth of pure rotational transition is usually larger

than the Doppler width.

Kinetic equation for the density matrix, ˆρ, in the representation of the eigen states of

the operator ˆH0 has standard form,

dˆρ/dt = ˆS − i[ ˆG + ˆV , ˆρ],

(6)

where ˆS is the collision integral.

Molecules in states (m, n, k) interacting with the perturbations ˆG and ˆV constitute only

small fraction of the total concentration of the test molecules. Thus, one can neglect collisions

between molecules in these states in comparison with collision with molecules in other states.
The latter molecules remain almost at equilibrium. Consequently, the collision integral, ˆS,

depends linearly on the density matrix for the disturbed states m, n, and k even in one

component gas. Further, we will assume model of strong collisions for the collision integral.
The oﬀ-diagonal elements of ˆS are

Sjj ′ = −Γρjj ′;

j, j ′ ∈ m, n, k;

j 6= j ′.

(7)

4

Here, j and j ′ indicate rotational states of the molecule. The decoherence rates, Γ, were
taken equal for all oﬀ-diagonal elements of ˆS.

Collisions cannot alter molecular spin state in our model. It implies that the diagonal

elements of ˆS have to be determined separately for ortho molecules,

Sjj = −νρo(j) + νwo(j)ρo;

ρo = Xj

ρo(j);

j ∈ ortho,

and for para molecules,

Sjj = −νρp(j) + νwp(j)ρp;

ρp = Xj

ρp(j);

j ∈ para.

(8)

(9)

Here ρo, ρp and wo(j), wp(j) are the total concentrations and Boltzmann distributions of

ortho and para molecules. The rotational relaxation rate, ν, was taken equal for ortho and

para molecules, because kinetic properties of diﬀerent spin species are almost identical.

One can obtain from Eq. (6) an equation of change of the total concentration in each

spin space [11]. For example, for ortho molecules one has,

dρo/dt = 2Re(iρmkVkm).

(10)

In fact, this result is valid for any model of collision integral as long as collisions do not

change the total concentration of molecules in each subspace, i.e., Pj Sjj = 0 if j ∈ ortho,
or j ∈ para.

Let us approximate the density matrix by the sum of zero and ﬁrst order terms over

perturbation ˆV ,

ˆρ = ˆρ(0) + ˆρ(1).

(11)

In zero order perturbation theory the ortho and para subspaces are independent, i.e., ρ(0)

mk =

0. Consequently, equation of change (10) is reduced to,

dρo/dt = 2Re(iρ(1)

mkVkm).

Note that the spin conversion appears in the second order of ˆV .

Kinetic equations for zero and ﬁrst order terms of the density matrix are given as,

dˆρ(0)/dt = ˆS(0) − i[ ˆG, ˆρ(0)].

dˆρ(1)/dt = ˆS(1) − i[ ˆG, ˆρ(1)] − i[ ˆV , ˆρ(0)].

5

(12)

(13)

(14)

We start with zero order perturbation theory. In this approximation, the para subspace

remain at equilibrium,

ρ(0)
p (j) = ρ(0)

p wp(j);

j ∈ para.

(15)

Here ρ(0)
p

is the total concentration of para molecules.

Density matrix for ortho molecules can be determined from the two equations which

follows from Eqs. (7),(8),(13):

o (j)/dt = −νρ(0)
dρ(0)
o (m|n)/dt = −Γρ(0)

o (j) + νwo(j)ρ(0)
o (m|n) − iGmn[ρ(0)

o + 2Re(iρ(0)
o (n) − ρ(0)

dρ(0)

o (m|n)Gnm)[δjm − δjn];
o (m)].

We will assume further the rotational wave approximation,

Gmn = −Ge−iΩt; G ≡ E0dmn/2¯h; Ω = ωL − ωmn,

(16)

(17)

where the line over symbol indicate a time-independent factor. Rabi frequency, G, is assumed

to be real. Rotational relaxation, ν, and decoherence, Γ, are on many orders of magnitude

faster than the spin conversion. It allows to assume stationary regime for ortho molecules,
o (m|n) exp (−iΩt), transforms

o (j)/dt = 0. The substitution, ρ(0)

o (m|n) = ρ(0)

thus having, dρ(0)

Eqs. (16) to algebraic equations which can easily be solved. Thus one has,

ρ(0)
o (j) = ρ(0)

B = Γ2 + 4ΓG2/ν; ∆w ≡ wo(n) − wo(m).

(18)

We turn now to the calculation of the ﬁrst order term, ρ(1)

mk, which has to be substituted

into the equation of change (12). The density matrix element, ρ(1)

mk, can be found from the

two equations which are derived from Eqs. (7),(14),

dρ(1)

mk/dt + Γρ(1)
nk /dt + Γρ(1)

mk + iGmnρ(1)
nk + iGnmρ(1)

nk = −iVmk[ρ(0)
mk = iVmkρ(0)

o (n|m).

Substitution,

nk = ρ(1)

(19)

(20)

transforms Eq. (19) to algebraic equations from which one ﬁnds ρ(1)

mk. Then, Eq. (12) gives

the following equation for the total concentration of ortho molecules,

(21)

After an appropriate change of notations, the right hand side of Eq. (21), coincides

formally with the solution [15] for the work of weak optical ﬁeld in the presence of strong

optical ﬁeld. Strong ﬁeld splits the upper state m on two, which appears as two roots of the

denominator of Eq. (21) being the second order polynomial on ω. It results in two ortho-para
level pairs mixed by the perturbation ˆV instead of one pair in the absence of an external

ﬁeld. In analogy with the optical case, one can distinguish the isomer conversion caused by

population eﬀects (terms proportional to the level populations ρ(0)

p (k) and ρ(0)
coherences (term proportional to the oﬀ-diagonal density matrix element, ρ(0)

o (m)) and by
o (n|m)).

Eq. (21) describes time dependence of the concentration of ortho molecules, ρo, in the
second order of ˆV . One can neglect at this approximation small diﬀerence between ρo and

ρ(0)
o . The density of para molecules can be expressed through the density of ortho molecules

as, ρ(0)

p = n−ρ(0)

o , where n is the total concentration of the test molecules. Using these points

and zero order solution given by Eqs. (15),(18), one can obtain ﬁnal equation of change for

ortho molecules,

dρo/dt = nγop − ρoγ;

γ ≡ γop + γpo + γn + γcoh,

(22)

where partial conversion rates were introduced,

γop = 2|V |2wp(k)f (Ω);
γpo = 2|V |2wo(m)f (Ω);

(23)

Here the rates γop, γpo, and γn are due to molecular level populations and the rate γcoh is

due to coherences. The terms γop and γpo are the only ones which remain in the absence of

an external ﬁeld. In the radiation free case (G = 0) the result (23) becomes identical with

the solution given in [11].

IV. ENRICHMENT

Solution to Eq. (22) can be presented as, ρo = ρo +δρo exp(−γt), where time-independent

part is given by

ρo = n

γop
γ

.

(24)

Without an external radiation (at the instant t = 0), the equilibrium concentration of para

molecules is equal to,

ρp(0) = n − ρo(0) = n

wo(m)

wp(k) + wo(m)

=

n
2

.

(25)

For simplicity, the Boltzmann factors in Eq. (25) were assumed to be equal, wp(k) =
wo(m) ≡ w, which implies, γop = γpo. External ﬁeld produces a stationary enrichment
of para molecules. One can derive from Eqs. (24),(25),

ρp
ρp(0) − 1 = 1 − 2

γop
γ

.

β ≡

(26)

An enrichment coeﬃcient, β, is deﬁned here in such a way that β = 0 if there is no external
electromagnetic ﬁeld. Enrichment of ortho molecules is equal to −β. Note, that the en-
richment, β, does not depend on the magnitude of intramolecular perturbation ˆV . It is the

consequence of the assumption that only one ortho-para level pair is mixed. Enrichment, β,

depends on the ratio of Boltzmann factors, wo(n)/wo(m), but does not depend on the mag-

nitude of wo(n) itself. In further numerical examples relative diﬀerence of the Boltzmann

factors will be chosen as wo(n) = 1.2w.

One needs to specify a few other parameters in order to investigate properties of the

optically induced enrichment. We will use, where it is possible, parameters relevant to the

spin conversion in 13CH3F. Thus the decoherence rate, Γ, will be chosen equal 6 MHz, which

corresponds to the gas pressure of pure CH3F equal 0.2 Torr [6]. Rotational relaxation, ν,

will be chosen by one order of magnitude slower than the decoherence rate, ν = 0.1Γ.

Expressions for the enrichment, β, are given in the Appendix. If ortho-para mixing is
performed for a degenerate pair of states m − k (ω = 0), the enrichment of para states, β,
has one peak at Ω = 0. This peak is determined mainly by population eﬀects.

More interesting is the case of nondegenerate states (ω 6= 0). In this case one has two
peaks, at Ω = −ω and at Ω = 0 (Fig. 2). Peak 1 (Ω = −ω) is due to the coherent eﬀects

8

determined by γcoh. Peak 2 (Ω = 0) is mainly due to the optically induced level population
changes determined by γn. In the case of well-separated peaks (ΓB ≪ ω), the amplitudes of
the peak 1 and peak 2 read,

Amplitude of the peak 2 grows rapidly with G up to β ≃ 4.5%. Amplitude of the peak 1
grows with G to even bigger value β ≃ 5.5%. These data are shown in Fig. 3 (upper panel)
where points are obtained by ﬁtting an exact expression (26) by two Lorentzians and solid

curves are given by Eqs. (27). ω was chosen equal 130 MHz which corresponds to the

ortho-para level gap in 13CH3F [6]. Note, that there is no optically induced enrichment if

∆w = 0.

Widths of the enrichment peaks are given by the expressions,

W1 = 2√Γ2 + G2; W2 = 2ΓB.

(28)

The two enrichment peaks experience completely diﬀerent power broadening which are

shown in Fig. 3 (low panel). Peak 1 has the width much smaller than the Peak 2. Solid

curves in Fig. 3 (low panel) are given by Eqs. (28). Points are obtained by ﬁtting the exact

expression for enrichment, β, by two Lorentzians.

V. CONVERSION

Conversion rate in the presence of an external electromagnetic ﬁeld has complicated

dependence on radiation frequency detuning, Ω, and Rabi frequency, G. It is convenient to

characterize the conversion rate in relative units,

γrel =

γ
γf ree − 1,

(29)

where γf ree is the ﬁeld free conversion rate. Similar to the enrichment, β, this parameter does
not depend on magnitude of the perturbation ˆV and on absolute values of the Boltzmann

factors.

Expressions for the conversion rate, γrel, are given in the Appendix.

In the case of
degenerate ortho-para level pair m − k (ω = 0), γrel has narrow negative structure at Ω = 0

9

(Fig. 4). Amplitude of this dip grows rapidly with increasing G. If G ≫ Γ ≫ ν, and all
Boltzmann factors have the same order of magnitude, the conversion rate at Ω = 0 is given

by

γrel ∼

Γ2
G2 − 1.

(30)

If G is large, the relative conversion rate, γrel ≃ −1, which corresponds to γ ≃ 0. Thus the
spin conversion can be inhibited by radiation having large G and Ω = 0.

In the nondegenerate case (ω 6= 0) conversion rate, γrel, has two peaks (Fig. 5). If these

peaks are well resolved, ΓB ≪ ω ′, conversion rate is given by,

(31)

(32)

(33)

These amplitudes are shown in Fig. 6 (upper panel) by solid curves. Points are obtained by

ﬁtting the exact solution by two Lorentzians. In this examples, ω was chosen equal 130 MHz.

Peak 4 at Ω = 0 is proportional to the ratio of Boltzmann factors. This peak does not grow
signiﬁcantly with G. The peak 3 at Ω = −ω ′ almost does not depend on Boltzmann factors
and at large G grows up to γrel = (ω/Γ)2. Thus strong electromagnetic ﬁeld can speed up

the conversion signiﬁcantly, viz., by two orders of magnitude in our numerical example.

Widths of the two peaks in the conversion rate are determined by the equations,

W3 = 2Γ′; W4 = 2ΓB,

(34)

and have very diﬀerent ﬁeld dependences. In fact, the peak 4 at Ω = 0 is broadened even
faster than 2ΓB. Peak 3 at Ω = −ω has almost no power broadening, if G ≪ ω (Fig. 6, low
panel). Solid curves in Fig. 6, low panel, corresponds to the Eqs. (34). Points are obtained

by ﬁtting the exact solution by two Lorentzians.

VI. CONCLUSIONS

We have shown that an external resonant radiation can inﬂuence spin isomer conversion

in two ways, through level populations and through optically induced coherences. The coher-

ences introduce in the process new and interesting features. In many cases, the coherences

play more important role than the level populations. This analysis have been performed in

a simplest arrangement in order to reveal the main features of the phenomenon.

Optically induced coherences introduce extra resonances both in enrichment and in con-

version frequency dependences. These new resonances are important for future experimental

realizations of the optical control of isomer conversion. First, they give convenient oppor-

tunity to ﬁnd coincidences between molecular transitions and available sources of powerful

radiation. Second, an observation of the phenomenon will be easier also because electro-

magnetic radiation can signiﬁcantly speed up the conversion. Thus steady state enrichment

can be achieved much faster than without ﬁeld. It allows to work at low gas pressures where

described above eﬀects can be achieved at smaller radiation intensity.

Another advantage is that one can use resonance at which there is no large radiation

absorption and, consequently, no signiﬁcant level population change by radiation. It should

decrease some spurious eﬀects, like molecular resonance exchange. The latter eﬀect can

cause serious problems in realization of the optically induced enrichment by population

eﬀects [7,8].

VII. APPENDIX

Here we give expressions for the enrichment, β, and conversion rate, γrel. Enrichment of
para molecules is given by Eq. (26). For equal Boltzmann factors, wo(m) = wp(k) ≡ w, one
has

β = 1 − 1 +

γn + γcoh

and an approximate expression in case of small enrichment,

There are two peaks in enrichment, at Ω = −ω and at Ω = 0. These peaks have Lorentzian

Thus the conversion rate has two peaks situated at Ω = −ω ′ and at Ω = 0. Position of the
peak at Ω = ω ′ depends on the ﬁeld intensity.

has complicated shape with a dip in the center at Ω = 0 (Fig. (4)). The whole structure is

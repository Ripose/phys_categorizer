Differential cross sections are computed for the title polar molecule using static interac-

tion, exchange forces and correlation-polarisation effects as described in detail in the main

text. The dipole effect is also reported via the dipole Born correction procedure and the ﬁnal

angular distributions are compared with existing experimental data. The shape and location

of the prominent low-energy resonance are computed and compared with experiments. The

comparison shows that the present treatment of the interaction forces and of the quantum

dynamics can indeed afford good agreement between measured and computed quantities for

a multielectron target as OCS.

INTRODUCTION

2

The carbon oxysulﬁde (OCS) molecule is well known to be of considerable importance for the

role it plays in the carbon chemistry and sulphur chemistry chains of reactions in molecular as-

trophysics environments like those in the diffuse and dark interstellar clouds (DISC)[1]. It is also

of interest in the realm of cold molecular plasmas because of its function as a reaction quencher

into the plasma formation. It follows, therefore, that collisional processes induced by low-energy

electrons in this molecular gas have triggered the interest of both experimentalists and theoreti-

cians, intrigued by the possible role that the permanent dipole of this target molecule can play in

characterizing the scattering attributes.

On the theoretical side, earlier calculations were carried out by Lynch et al.[2] using their con-

tinuum scattering model, with which they found the presence of a Π symmetry shape resonance

around 1.15 eV and a sharp increase at threshold of the Σ symmetry partial cross section. The dif-

ferential cross sections (DCSs) for elastic scattering and for vibrational excitations were measured
by Sohn and coworkers [3], where the authors also observed a π∗ resonance and a strong excita-
tion of the bending mode associated to dipole coupling and to a possible bound state of (OCS−)∗.

Further measurements are due to Szmytkowski et al. [4] who measured the total, integral cross

sections of the title molecule and conﬁrmed a Π-type resonance around 1.15 eV. More recent mea-

surements have been carried out by the Japanese group [5], who compared similar measurements
with electrons and positrons as projectiles and conﬁrmed the presence of the π∗ resonance around

1.15 eV. The vibrational excitation of OCS has been measured by another study from the same

group [6]. Calculations of elastic cross sections, integral and differential, and of the momentum

transfer cross sections have been performed by Bettega et al. [7], who employed the Schwinger

multichannel method with pseudopotentials within the static-exchange approximation and exam-

ined a range of energies from 5 to 50 eV.

A combined theoretical-experimental study has been conducted by Michelin et al. [8] who car-

ried out both measurements and calculations in the energy regime from 0.4 eV to 600 eV. Further

calculations of both integral and differential cross sections were reported very recently by Bettega

et al. [9], who employed again the Schwinger multichannel method with pseudopotentials,adding

the polarization interaction to their static-exchange initial scheme. A further ”addendum” to the

above results was recently published with regard to the Σ-symmetry partial cross sections [10].

In the present study we intend to discuss in some detail the behavior of the computed angular

3

distributions with respect to the available experiments over a very broad range of collision energies,

using an entirely different method as that employed by the earlier, just as extensive, calculations

of references [8, 9, 10]. The following Section describes brieﬂy our theoretical and computational

approach while Section III reports our results for both the partial integral cross sections and the

differential cross sections. The last Section IV summarizes our present conclusions.

II. THE THEORETICAL MODELLING

A. The separable exchange representation

One of the major requests from accurate calculations of low energy electron-molecule scatter-

ing observables is the correct description of the non-local part of the interaction potential. For

electronically elastic collisions, a physically realistic treatment usually starts with the static in-

teraction and views the exchange potential as a correction to the latter due to the imposition of

anti-symmetry on the total electronic wavefunction that describes the scattered electron plus the

target bound electrons. Even in this case, however, the correct treatment of non-local forces for

polyatomic molecules still represents a rather formidable task and therefore increasing use is be-

ing made of separate representations which expand the exchange kernel in terms of products of

one-electron functions [11]. This approach will be adopted in the present paper, following our

extension of this method to polyatomic molecular targets [12, 13]. It has the advantage of being a

non-empirical method for treating exchange forces while still offering computational savings with

respect to the exact solution of the integro-differential equations of non-local electron-molecular

scattering theory [14]. The earlier work on separate exchange in electron collision with small

diatomics has been rather encouraging since fairly small exchange basis sets added little more

computer time than a local potential calculation [11, 12] and therefore we use such an approach

on the linear polyatomic target of the present study.

One starts by approximating the exchange potential W (r, re) by the truncated separate form

other, nor to the occupied molecular orbitals (MOs) of the target SCF basis set which describes the
ground state of the target molecule. The vector coordinates (r) and (re) describe the positions of

the bound and of the scattered electrons, respectively. The Wα,β now represents the two-electron

interaction operator over the truncated, discrete basis.

When performing the separable expansion (1) care should be taken of how to specify the ex-

become too massive or begin to suffer from linear dependency effects. We have carefully checked

this aspect of the problem by analysing in each case the corresponding eigenvectors of the overlap

matrix and modifying the basis set accordingly.

The required exchange matrix elements for the bound MOs of the target, taken to be a closed-

shell structure, are therefore given by ﬁrst calculating the following matrix elements ,via a standard

bielectronic subroutine

III. COMPUTED AND MEASURED CROSS SECTIONS

A. Computational details

The interatomic distances were ﬁxed at their experimental values of Roc = 2.196 a0 and Rcs =

2.941a0. The two components of the dipole polarisability tensor were taken also, in the asymptotic
interaction, to be the experimental values: α0(Req) = 35.1a3

0 and α2(Req) = 17.5a3

0. The above

choice was dictated by our desire to realistically treat low-energy effects which are known to be

strongly affected by polarisabilities.

To describe the target electrons in the neutral ground state we employed a double-zeta D95V
basis set plus polarization orbitals as in the expansion described as D95V∗ [16]. The obtained total

energy was therefore -1020.4122528 hartrees, with a dipole of 0.32 a.u. and a quadrupole of 0.87

a.u., to be computed with the experimental values of 0.27 a.u. for the dipole [4]. No experimental

value of the molecular quadrupole was found to be available.

The radial grid chosen for the Volterra integrals went from 0.005 a0 to 10.0 a0, beyond which

the integration was extended out to 1,000 a0 using the asymptotic static multipoles plus the po-

larization potential. The multipolar went up to λmax=70 while the bound orbitals were expanded

around the center of mass up to lmax=118.

Table I reports the additional GTO’s employed to describe the separable exchange and used in

the dynamical calculations outlined in the previous Section.

The single-center partialwave expansion of the discretized, continuum orbitals employed to

treat exchange involved lmax=15 for the

symmetry, lmax=20 for the Π symmetry and lmax=15

for the ∆ symmetry.

The above set of functions was the result of a series of numerical tests at a set of chosen energies

where we increased the number and quality of the additional GTO’s until the corresponding, ﬁnal

K-matrix elements varied by less than 0.1%.

B. The integral cross section

The results reported by ﬁgure 1 analyze the partial and total integral, elastic cross sections

(rotationally summed) for their overall energy dependence over the broad range of energies which

is experimentally available [3, 4, 5], but we only report a comparison with some of the data in

order not to crowd the ﬁgure excessively. We also show in the lower panel the energy behavior of

the individual partial cross sections for the contributing partial symmetries.

It is reassuring to see that the present calculations follow closely the experimental ﬁndings from

below 1.0 eV of energy and up to 100 eV: this is a rather good result considering the complexity

of the molecule and the broad range of energies spanned by the calculations. Furthermore, we

see that the resonance position is obtained reasonably well from our calculations, albeit with a

sharper peak due to the absence of vibrational averaging, which also come very close to the recent

calculations of Bettega et al. [9] that employed an entirely different method for obtaining it.

The lower panel in the ﬁgure reports the energy dependence of the various partial cross sections

which contribute to the scattering process. The calculations clearly show that:

1. the resonance around 1 eV is due to the Π symmetry i.e. to the expected dynamical (cen-
trifugal) trapping of the electron into a π∗ metastable orbital by the l=1 angular momentum

barrier;

2. there is a second π∗ resonance at higher energies (

10 eV) which is a broader one and which

∼

9

is also seen in the experimental data;

3. the Σ-symmetry exhibits the expected dominance of s-wave scattering as one moves down to

low energies [10] and the corresponding cross section goes through a Ramsauer-Townsend

minimum around 0.7 eV, as also analyzed and discussed by recent calculations of Bettega et

al. [10];

4. the Σ-symmetry cross section also suggests the presence of a σ∗ resonance around 4-5 eV

which is also seen in the experiments (upper panel) as a shoulder on the raising cross section

energy dependence around 4 eV. In Fig. 2 we report the behaviour of the eigenphase sum

associated with the Σ symmetry component. We see that, at low energies, this quantity goes

through zero, as in ref.[10], and therefore it suggests the presence of an RT minimum in

the elastic cross section. It further increases from zero energy values and goes through a

maximum as shown by similar data in ref.[10].

In conclusions, the present calculations for partial and total integral cross sections indicate

that our present approach can reliably describe the experimental behavior over a very broad

range of energies and can also reproduce earlier calculations very closely to their ﬁndings

as far as partial symmetry contributions are concerned.

The previous literature [8, 9, 10] also discusses the possibility of having a virtual state close

to zero energies detected by a negative value of the scattering length. Since the present

system is a polar target, no modiﬁed effective range theory can be applied [16] and no

scattering length could therefore be uniquely deﬁned. Different procedures therefore need

to be used to extract information on the possible existence of virtual states [18] in polar

targets. In the present case, however, we decided that such a study was outside the scope of

our current aims.

C. Angular distributions at low energies

We have shown above that the well marked, low energy resonance appears, but in experi-

ments and calculations, around 1 eV of collision energy, and therefore it becomes of interest

to also see what the angular distributions look like across that range of energies. The results

of our calculations, and their comparisons with the existing experiments, are shown in the

10

various panels of ﬁgure 3 and ﬁgure 4 where the energies vary from 0.4 eV up to 3.0 eV.

The experiments are those of Sohn et al. [3] and from Tanaka [5], respectively marked by

open circles and open triangles in all the panels, while the calculations (dashed curves) are

from reference [8]. The following comments could be made:

(a) at the lowest collision energies the scattering is dominated by the weak dipole interac-

tion which causes a marked forward scattering behavior, which is also well reproduced

by our calculations. On the other hand, in the larger angle region the agreement be-

comes less satisfactory, possibly due to our model treatment of short-range correlation

effects. We also see that at 1.15 eV the earlier calculations [8] also do not agree well

with experiments.

(b) as the collision energy moves across the position of the strong π∗ resonance, as shown

by the panels of ﬁgures 3 and 4, we see that the angular distributions become much
20◦ and out to 140◦, with a markedly reduced forward peak, with the

ﬂatter from ϑ

latter resuming as soon as the energy leaves the resonance region (e.g. see panels in

∼

ﬁgures 3 and 4).

(c) We also see from Fig. 4 that, while the agreement with experiments is good at 2.0 eV,

and remains reasonableat 2.5 - 3 eV, indicating numerical convergence of our present

results to the same level of reliability with respect to the experiments.

In other words, we see the dominant presence of a forward scattering behavior of the DCSs un-

less we are at the resonance position, where the ’orbiting’ features of the trapped electron distorts

the effects coming from the permanent dipole of the target molecule.

D. The DCSs at higher energies

Since the experimental data for the angular distributions are available over a broad range of
collision energies, we have analyzed them rather carefully from above the dominant π∗ resonance

out to about 100 eV. The comparisons with the measured data are shown in ﬁgures from 5 through

7. The following comments could be made from a perusal of the data shown in those ﬁgures:

1. the present calculations are seen to follow measurements remarkably well, both in shape

and size, over the whole energy range;

FIG. 2: Computed eigenphase sum behavior within the Σ symmetry component of the scattered electron.

2. at 5.0 eV the data from Sohn et al.[2] differ from those of Tanaka et al. [5] in the small-

angle region since they indicate there a strong forward peaking of the angular distributions:

our calculated values follow those measurements very accurately, thereby conﬁrming the

experimental ﬁndings in that angular regime;

3. as the collision energy increases one sees an increasing ﬂattening of the DCSs as a function

of the scattering angle and the appearance of the forward peaks at increasingly smaller

angles: the calculations follow suit in the sense that indeed show the same general behavior

as that indicated by the experiments.

IV. PRESENT CONCLUSIONS

The calculations discussed in this work have analyzed, using a quantum treatment of the scat-

tering dynamics, the elastic cross sections for electron impact on the OCS target molecule in the

gas phase. In particular, we have employed the exact description of the static potential and a sep-

arable representation of the exchange potential, both represented via a single-center expansion,

and we have further added correlation-polarization effects via a density functional formulation

that we have discussed many times before [17]. The corresponding integro-differential equations

12

have been solved via quadratures of Volterra equations as discussed in section II and the angular

distributions have been computed including the Born dipole corrections beyond the partialwave

value of lmax=30 [20]. The ﬁnal results for the integral cross sections indeed conﬁrm the presence,

around 1 eV of collision energy, of a narrow and intense shape resonance of Π-symmetry associ-
ated to a well-known π∗ resonance for the title system (e.g- see discussion in ref.s[7, 9]. It also
suggests the presence of further two resonances of π∗ and σ∗ symmetry and larger widths, together

with a clear Ramsauer-Townsend minimum in the cross sections around 0.7 eV [10]. Furthermore,

the various available angular distributions for the elastic scattering have also been analyzed over

a very broad range of collision energies, spanning nearly 100 eV, and compared with the existing

experiments and with the earlier calculations [8, 9, 10]. The comparison of all the distribution data

were presented in the previous Section and they show fair agreement between the measurements

and with other computations [8, 9, 10]. The present calculations also show particularly good cor-

respondence between computed and measured distributions for energies from 3.0 eV and up to

100 eV. Considering the complex, many-electron structure of the target and the broad range of

collision dynamics which has been analyzed, our results do indicate the robustness of the adopted

dynamical integrator and the reliability of the theoretical modelling which we have employed in

this study.

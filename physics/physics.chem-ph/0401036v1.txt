Thermodynamic Sampling of Molecular Conformations

Andreas Kr¨amer∗

January 8, 2004

Abstract

Torsional-space Monte Carlo simulations of ﬂexible molecules are usually based on
the assumption that all values of dihedral angles have equal probability in the absence
of atomic interactions. In the present paper it is shown that this assumption is not
valid. Thermodynamic sampling using dihedral angles or other internal coordinates has
to account for both the correct metric in conformational space and the conformation-
dependence of the moment of inertia tensor. Metric and moment of inertia terms
appear as conformation-dependent factors in the partition function and are obtained by
proper separation of internal and rotational degrees of freedom. The importance of both
factors is discussed for a number of short peptides as well as for the folded and unfolded
states of a protein. It is concluded that thermodynamic Monte Carlo simulations of
protein folding that neglect these correction factors tend to underestimate the stability
of the folded state.

1 Introduction

Many organic molecules are able to adopt a large number of diﬀerent conformations at room
temperature which has far reaching consequences for their thermodynamic and biochemical
properties. In order to separate rotational and translational degrees of freedom, molecular
conformations are generally expressed in terms of internal coordinates where it is often
suﬃcient to describe the conformational state of a molecule by a set of dihedral angles
since the eﬀect of high-frequency bond angle and length ﬂuctuations can approximately be
included in the potential energy [1].

Dihedral angle coordinates are frequently used to sample molecular conformations in
Monte Carlo simulations of biomolecules (see for example [2, 3, 4, 5]). These thermodynamic
simulations are usually based on the assumption that the volume element appearing in the
M
i=1 dφi where φi are dihedral angles and M is the number
partition function is given by
of rotatable bonds. This means that in the absence of atomic interactions all values of
dihedral angles are sampled with equal probability. In the present paper it is shown that
this underlying assumption is generally not valid, and that the proper metric in internal
coordinate space as well as eﬀects arising from the conformation-dependence of the moment
of inertia tensor have to be taken into account in order to accurately calculate thermodynamic
quantities.

Q

The main mathematical problem in a formulation of the statistical mechanics in the
space of molecular conformations (which we will call brieﬂy shape space or shape manifold
in the following) poses the proper separation of motions in internal coordinates (or shape
coordinates) and rotations. This is non-trivial since it is not possible to deﬁne a body frame
of reference in a unique way as it can be done for a rigid body. In fact, one can choose an
arbitrary coordinate system for each diﬀerent conformation. It is known that this freedom
in the choice of the coordinate system can be expressed in terms of a gauge potential [6, 7]
where local gauge transforms correspond to independent rotations of coordinate systems,
hence the gauge symmetry group is SO(3). An interesting property of systems with internal
degrees of freedom is the possibility to generate a change in orientation solely by the variation
of shape without the application of an external torque, i.e., by moving through a closed path
in shape space. The most prominent example for this eﬀect is the ability of a falling cat to
land on its feet starting from an upside-down position while the total angular momentum
is zero. Another example is the observation of a slow rotation of the whole system over
time in zero-angular momentum molecular dynamics simulations of proteins [8]. This net
rotation of the system is an example of a so-called geometric phase [9] which is independent
of the parametrization of the closed path in shape space and also gauge-invariant. In the
case of three-dimensional molecules the practical calculation of these geometric phases is
complicated by the fact that the group of rotations, SO(3), is non-Abelian, however, this
will not be important for the following discussion.

A deeper mathematical foundation of the subject as well as generalizations can be for-
mulated using ﬁber-bundles [10]. From a classical mechanical standpoint all these rotation-
related eﬀects can of course also be discussed in terms of Coriolis forces. A comprehensive

2

recent review on the separation of internal motions and rotations in the N-body problem
(with emphasis on gauge ﬁelds) has recently been given by Littlejohn and Reinsch [11].

In the following section we discuss the classical canonical partition function in shape space
(its detailed derivation is given in the Appendix) and show that it introduces two shape-
dependent correction factors which are not present in the usual Cartesian-space partition
function involving atom coordinates. The ﬁrst factor transforms the volume element in
shape coordinates to the true volume element on the non-Euclidean shape manifold and
involves the metric tensor. The second term reﬂects the conformation-dependence of the
moment of inertia tensor. Using dihedral angles as shape coordinates the importance of
these correction terms is discussed in Section 3 for a number of small peptides, Ace-(Ala)n-
Nme with n = 1, 2, 3, and the pentapeptide Met-enkephalin. In Section 4 we estimate and
compare the correction terms that arise in the folded and unfolded states of a protein.

2 Statistical mechanics on the shape manifold

We consider a molecule consisting of N atoms with masses mα for which a conformation is
uniquely described by M shape coordinates qi, i = 1 . . . M. The Cartesian atom coordinates
are given as functions of the shape coordinates,

~cα = ~cα(q1, . . . , qM )

with α = 1, . . . , N. The vectors ~cα are taken to be center of mass coordinates, i.e. we assume
α mα~cα(q1, . . . , qM ) = 0. The choice of the functions
that for all tuples (q1, . . . , qM ) it is
~cα is of course not unique because the atom coordinates for a given conformation are only
determined up to an overall rotation of the molecule. In fact we could replace the functions
~cα by their arbitrarily rotated versions,

where the rotation matrix R is an arbitrary function of the shape coordinates. The only
assumption we make is, that R(q1, . . . , qM ) and ~cα(q1, . . . , qM ) are suﬃciently well-behaved
w.r.t. the existence of derivatives. Because of the shape-dependence of the atom coordi-
nates, the moment of inertia tensor M (Appendix Eq. (19)) is also a function of the shape
coordinates. It is convenient to write M as a dimensionless quantity,

~cα and hence the metric tensor gij (see Eq. (25) in the Appendix) is gauge-invariant,
i.e. independent of the choice of the rotation functions R(q1, . . . , qM ). As noted in the
introduction it can be shown that closed paths in shape space are associated with a change
in orientation of the molecule. According to Eq. (22) in the Appendix the (gauge-dependent)
inﬁnitesimal rotation vector d~φ0 associated with the variation of shape coordinates dqi is
given by d~φ0 =
~Aidqi. The net rotation S generated by moving through a closed path
in shape space can be calculated by accumulating these inﬁnitesimal rotations along the
path. However, because of the non-Abelian nature of the rotation group SO(3), i.e. the
fact that rotations do not commute if their rotation axes are diﬀerent, it is only possible
to express S in terms of a path-ordered product [11]. As a measurable quantity, S is of
course gauge-invariant and also independent of the parametrization of the closed path. It is
possible to derive an explicit expression for S in the case of inﬁnitesimal small loops where a
generalized version of Stokes’ theorem can be applied [11]. A consequence of the existence of
orientational changes associated with closed loops in shape space is the fact that the shape
manifold deﬁned by the metric gij cannot be embedded in the 3N-dimensional coordinate
space as a single-valued function, i.e. the shape manifold does not only exhibit curvature but
also torsion [12].

molecule. Note, that no translational degrees of freedom have been taken into account in
deriving Z since the atom coordinates ~cα are deﬁned as center of mass coordinates. How-
ever, because of the separability of center of mass movements in the equation of motion,
translational eﬀects can simply be included by an additional prefactor of Z. In the case of
orientational constraints the prefactor 8π2 would have to be modiﬁed accordingly.

Below, we will calculate FG and FM for a number of molecules.
In the remainder of the
paper it is assumed that the shape coordinates q1, . . . , qM are given by the dihedral angles
φ1, . . . , φM , where M is the number of rotatable bonds.

The eﬀect of the correction factors (det ˜gij)1/2 and (det ˜M)1/2 becomes visible in the
probability distributions Pn(φ) of the dihedral angles φn in the absence of atomic interactions.
If the correction factors are omitted in Eq. (7) values of the dihedral angles are uniformly
distributed with Pi(φ) = (2π)−1, a fact which is sometimes used to test microreversibility
in Monte Carlo simulations with complicated concerted-rotation move sets [4]. Here, these

3 Correction factors for small molecules

In this section we calculate the conformation-dependent correction factors in the partition
function (7) and the related quantities FG and FM at T = 300 K for the peptides Ace-
(Ala)1,2,3-Nme as well as for the pentapeptide Met-enkephalin with the sequence Tyr-Gly-
Gly-Phe-Met. We only consider dihedral angles at fully rotatable bonds (ω-angles are set to
180◦) that do not connect to methyl- or NH+
3 -groups. Conformations of the polyalanines are
parametrized by 2, 4, and 6 dihedral angles, while 17 dihedral angles have to be taken into

5

account for Met-enkephalin. Potential energies have been calculated with the Tinker software
package [13] using the OPLS all-atom forceﬁeld [14] (without electrostatic interaction cut oﬀ
and with ǫ = 1) in conjunction with a GB/SA implicit-solvent term [15].

Fig. 1 shows the terms (det ˜gij)1/2 and (det ˜M)1/2 as functions of the dihedral angles
φ and ψ for alanine dipeptide (Ace-Ala-Nme).
It is seen that both terms show relative
variations of about 25% and 30% respectively. The corresponding variations of FG and FM
are 0.17 kcal/mol and 0.21 kcal/mol. Note that only these relative variations matter for
the calculation of thermodynamic quantities. The distributions of the eﬀective energies FG
and FM for Ace-(Ala)2,3-Nme and Met-enkephalin are shown in Fig. 2, 3, and 4, where each
point (FG, FM ) corresponds to a low-energy molecular conformation. For the polyalanines
conformations have been obtained on an equidistant grid in dihedral angle space with grid
In total 104 conformations have been sampled for Ace-(Ala)2-Nme,
spacing ∆φ = π/5.
and 106 conformations for Ace-(Ala)3-Nme. Of these conformations, Fig. 2 (Fig. 3) shows
those 200 (1000) with the lowest potential energies. The insets in Fig. 2 and 3 give the
corresponding cumulative energy distributions.

Conformations of the larger and more ﬂexible molecule Met-enkephalin cannot be ob-
tained by explicit enumeration. In this case conformations have been generated by randomly
choosing dihedral angles and subsequently applying an annealing and energy minimization
procedure that uses short stochastic dynamics runs at decreasing temperatures followed by
steepest-descend minimization, and thereby mostly avoiding steric clashes and other high-
energy situations. This way, 2000 conformations have been generated, of which those 200
with the lowest potential energies have been plotted in Fig. 4 along with the cumulative
energy distribution shown in the inset. It is known that Met-enkephalin does not adopt a
single conformation in aqueous solution at room temperature [16], last but not least because
of its biological function as a neuro-transmitter binding to a number of diﬀerent receptors.
One may therefore expect, that many conformations generated by the procedure described
above can actually be assumed by the molecule under biological conditions.

Variations ∆FG and ∆FM of the energies FG and FM in Fig. 2, 3, and 4 (here deﬁned
by the diﬀerence between maximal and minimal values in the data) strongly depend on
the size of the molecule. While for Ace-(Ala)2-Nme and Ace-(Ala)3-Nme these variations
are small (∆FG = 0.29 kcal/mol and ∆FM = 0.21 kcal/mol in the ﬁrst case, and ∆FG =
0.53 kcal/mol and ∆FM = 0.35 kcal/mol in the latter one), they become more signiﬁcant
for Met-enkephalin, where FG and FM vary by ∆FG = 2.45 kcal/mol and ∆FM = 0.77
kcal/mol according to the data plotted in Fig. 4. Fig. 5 shows those conformations of Met-
enkephalin that correspond to the numbered data points in Fig. 4 where FG and FM and
therefore (det ˜gij)1/2 and (det ˜M)1/2 assume extreme values. Clearly, conformations with
small factor (det ˜M)1/2 exhibit a small radius of gyration and are therefore more compact
than conformations with large values of this term. The interpretation of the term (det ˜gij)1/2
is more diﬃcult and its values depend on the details of the molecule. However, consistent with
the pictures shown in Fig. 5 it can be said that more “rigid”, stretched conformations lead to
a smaller factor (det ˜gij)1/2 than “sloppier”, curved conformations, where small changes in the
dihedral angles result in larger changes in the atom coordinates. Since conformations with

6

large radius of gyration are usually more stretched than those with small radius of gyration
we may explain the weak negative correlation between FG and FM indicated by the straight
0.5427,
lines (obtained by a least squares ﬁt) in Fig. 2, 3, and 4 (correlation coeﬃcient =
0.1511). We do not ﬁnd correlations between the potential energy E and
−
FG or FM except for the case of Met-enkephalin, where E is negatively correlated with FM
because more compact conformations forming hydrogen bonds or salt bridges are found to
be energetically favored by several kcal/mol.

for all 17 dihedral angles of Met-enkephalin using 106 randomly sampled conformations. It
is seen that deviations from the uniform distribution Pn(φ) = (2π)−1 of up to 40% occur for
some of the dihedral angles (most prominently for φ3, φ11, and φ16, where the indices refer
to the bond indices shown in Fig. 5). This again demonstrates that the correction factors
(det ˜gij)1/2 and (det ˜M)1/2 are signiﬁcant for Met-enkephalin.

4 Protein folding

In this section we discuss the terms FG and FM in the context of folded and unfolded states
of a protein with radii of gyration Rfolded and Runfolded. At ﬁrst, an estimate of FG is given
considering only backbone dihedral angles (φ and ψ-angles) with the assumption that the
contributions of side chain dihedrals to the metric tensor gij are roughly the same for folded
and unfolded states. In order to calculate the determinant of gij we have to estimate its
eigenvalues λ. One may argue, that the corresponding eigenvectors are localized on the
peptide chain and span about seven adjacent torsion angles, having in mind that six is the
number of angles needed to solve the so-called rebridging problem for polymer chains [17].
This means, that there is one free parameter in the concerted motion of seven adjacent φ/ψ-
angles leaving the rest of the protein unchanged. We therefore assume that an eigenvector
of gij corresponds to a loop of about seven residues with length ℓ and with endpoints A

7

and B. Let r be the average distance of A and B, and ξ the length scale of the average
lateral ﬂuctuations of such a loop w.r.t. the axis ~AB. Since this is a short loop (w.r.t. to
r2. The
the persistence length scale) we estimate the scaling behavior of ξ to be ξ
mξ2, where m is the mass of the loop,
corresponding eigenvalue of gij should scale as λ
ℓ and

One may therefore conclude that energy corrections due to the metric of the dihedral angle
shape manifold are a signiﬁcant energetic contribution and should be taken into account in
folding simulations using Monte Carlo moves based on dihedral angles.

≈

We now turn to the term det M. Since this term arises form the thermal equilibration
of angular momentum its contribution is for instance not included in molecular dynamics
simulations that enforce L = 0 for the protein. In order to estimate FM we have to consider
inertial eﬀects of the solvent as well. While these eﬀects should be negligible for small
molecules it is reasonable to assume that in the unfolded state of a globular protein many
water molecules are eﬀectively trapped and therefore rigidly coupled. For our estimate we
therefore consider two limiting cases: complete viscous coupling of the solvent (i.e. neglecting
inertial eﬀects of the solvent at all) and complete rigid coupling, (i.e. all solvent molecules in
the sphere deﬁned by the radius of gyration R are rigidly coupled to the protein). In the ﬁrst
mR2
case the components M of the diagonalized moment of inertia tensor M scale as M

Note, that ∆FG and ∆FM have diﬀerent signs: Unfolded or stretched conformations have
a smaller value of det gij because the loops are stiﬀer and therefore dihedral angle variations
result in smaller variations in Cartesian space, while the moment of inertia is the larger the
larger the characteristic length scale of the molecule is. This conﬁrms the trend that had
already been observed for small molecules discussed in the previous section. It is seen that

5 Discussion and conclusion

It has been shown in the present paper that statistical mechanical sampling of molecular
conformations has to account for the correct metric gij in conformational space as well as
the conformation-dependence of the moment of inertia tensor M, both of which can be
expressed in terms of eﬀective conformation-dependent energy contributions, FG and FM .
Using dihedral angles as internal coordinates, the distribution of these energy contributions
for low-energy conformations has been calculated numerically for a number of short peptides.
While their inﬂuence is small for molecules with few rotatable bonds, we ﬁnd variations of
FG and FM of about 2.45 kcal/mol (for FG) and 0.77 kcal/mol (for FM ) for the pentapeptide
Met-enkephalin. A rough estimate of both terms in the folded and unfolded states of a protein
with 50 residues leads to the signiﬁcant energy diﬀerence of 7.5 kcal/mol for FG and between
-0.85 kcal/mol and -2.1 kcal/mol for FM . This shows that both correction terms should
be taken into account when dihedral coordinates are used in thermodynamic Monte Carlo
simulations of protein folding in order to accurately calculate thermodynamic quantities.
Since FG + FM is larger in the unfolded state of a protein, Monte Carlo simulations that
omit these corrections lead to free energy diﬀerences between unfolded and folded states that
are too small. These simulations therefore underestimate the stability of the folded state.
The eﬃcient implementation of metric and moment of inertia-related correction terms within
a Monte Carlo algorithm will be subject of a future publication.

A related problem, where the consideration of the proper metric in conformational space
is important, is the estimate of thermodynamic quantities from a given, ﬁnite ensemble of
molecular conformations. Such ensembles can be generated for molecules with not too many
rotatable bonds and allow for the calculation of free energies and conformational entropies
which are otherwise diﬃcult to access in importance sampling-based methods. An example
is the calculation of protein side chain free energies [20] from rotamer libraries [21].
In
principle it is possible to estimate thermodynamic properties such as entropies from any given
ensemble of conformations without referring to underlying internal coordinates. Distances
according to the metric gij can be approximated by the mass-weighted RMSD between two
conformations minimized w.r.t. rotations and translations. However, the calculation of the
partition function would then require a triangulation procedure in order to calculate volume
elements in conformational space.

In order to keep equations as simple as
possible three diﬀerent notations are used to distinguish between vectors in three-dimensional
Cartesian space, sums over atom positions ~cα, α = 1 . . . N and sums over shape coordinates
qi, i = 1 . . . M. Three-dimensional vectors are given in a vector notation with dots (
) and
·
crosses (
) for scalar and vector products. The Einstein sum convention is employed for
summation over latin indices involving the shape coordinates qi. Sums over atom positions
(greek indices) are written explicitly. We also deﬁne a 3N-dimensional vector (denoted
in bold face), c = (~c1, . . . , ~cN ), that contains the (three-dimensional) atom positions as

Note, that the variation dck is independent of the freedom in the choice of the coordinate
functions ~cα(q1, . . . , qM ) described in Eq. (2) because it has been obtained by minimizing the
distance D, while dc⊥ is non-unique and depends on this choice. According to Eq. (16) and
(17) the inﬁnitesimal distance D0 corresponds to the mass-weighted RMSD between c + dc
and c minimized w.r.t. rotations.

Let us now use a body frame of reference and assume that the Cartesian coordinates of
the system are momentarily described by the vector c. Consider a variation of Cartesian
coordinates dr which is the sum of a shape contribution dc and an external inﬁnitesimal
rotation given by d~φ

We now assume that the system is only subject to forces between the atoms, which means
that the potential energy V = V (q1, . . . , qM ) is a function of the shape coordinates alone

Here, gij is the inverse metric tensor, and qi and pi are canonically conjugated variables. It is
not possible to deﬁne coordinates which are canonically conjugated to the angular momentum
~L [11], because the angular velocity ~ω cannot be written as a simple time derivative of angular
coordinates. Nevertheless, in order to derive the partition function Z from
, it is necessary
to describe the rotational part of the Hamiltonian
with canonical variables as well. This
can be achieved by using Euler angles θ, ϕ, ψ and their canonically conjugated momenta pθ,
pϕ, pψ. Here, it is convenient to use the principle axes of the moment of inertia tensor M as
the basis of the underlying coordinate system (where M is diagonal). With

where β is the inverse temperature. The factor
comes from the standard “coarse-
graining” procedure in phase space which is a way to derive the correct quantum-mechanical
(cid:16)
prefactor of classical partition functions [19].
In this procedure, as a consequence of the
Heisenberg uncertainty relation, the phase space is devided into cells with volume ∆p∆q =
2π¯h, where p and q are arbitrary pairs of conjugated generalized canonical coordinates and
momenta.

(cid:17)

In order to obtain the partition function in the shape coordinates qi alone we ﬁrst integrate
(31) over the generalized momenta pi, followed by an integration over the Euler momenta
pθ, pϕ, pψ. These integrals a purely Gaussian and can readily be performed analytically.
Finally, the integration over all orientations of the system, i.e. the Euler angles themselves,
is trivial and results in a numerical factor 8π2. This leads to the ﬁnal result

It is seen, that the factor (det gij)1/2 which depends on the shape coordinates qi results
from the equilibration of the momenta in shape space, while the factor (det M)1/2 originates

from the equilibration of angular momentum. Upon absorbing the factor
determinants we arrive at the expression for Z given in Eq. (7).

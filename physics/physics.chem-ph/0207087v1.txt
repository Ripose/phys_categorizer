Transient behavior in Single-File Systems

S.V. Nedea,∗ A.P.J. Jansen,† J.J. Lukkien,‡ and P.A.J. Hilbers§
(Dated: November 21, 2013)

We have used Monte-Carlo methods and analytical techniques to investigate the inﬂuence of
the characteristics, such as pipe length, diﬀusion, adsorption, desorption and reaction rates on the
transient properties of Single-File Systems. The transient or the relaxation regime is the period in
which the system is evolving to equilibrium. We have studied the system when all the sites are
reactive and when only some of them are reactive. Comparisons between Mean-Field predictions,
Cluster Approximation predictions, and Monte Carlo simulations for the relaxation time of the
system are shown. We outline the cases where Mean-Field analysis gives good results compared to
Dynamic Monte-Carlo results. For some speciﬁc cases we can analytically derive the relaxation time.
Occupancy proﬁles for diﬀerent distribution of the sites both for Mean-Field and simulations are
compared. Diﬀerent results for slow and fast reaction systems and diﬀerent distribution of reactive
sites are discussed.

INTRODUCTION

tems. [12, 13, 14, 15, 16]

Although systems in nature evolve by obeying phys-
ical laws,
it is in most cases diﬃcult or not feasible
to describe the system properties accurately since de-
tails of the microscopic dynamics are not fully known.
Therefore we usually deal with simpliﬁed models for
these systems of which stochastic models are an exam-
ple. They are thus described by a reduced set of dy-
namic variables. Although many exact solutions have
been found, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] the vast majority of stochastic
models cannot be solved exactly. Many results for equi-
librium systems [7, 8, 9, 10, 11] have been classiﬁed. In
nature, however, equilibrium is rather an exception than
a rule. In most cases the temporal evolution starts from
an initial state which is far away from equilibrium. The
relaxation of such a system towards its stationary state
depends on the speciﬁc dynamical properties and cannot
be described within the framework of equilibrium statis-
tical mechanics. Instead it is necessary to set up a model
for the microscopic dynamics of the system. Assuming
certain transition probabilities, the time-dependent prob-
ability distribution Pt(s) to ﬁnd the system in conﬁgura-
tion s has to be derived from the Master Equation (ME).
Solving the ME is usually a diﬃcult task. Therefore, the
theoretical understanding of non-equilibrium processes is
still at its beginning. Better understanding of these phe-
nomena would be an important step as non-equilibrium
systems exhibit a richer behavior than equilibrium sys-

We investigate non-equilibrium processes for a Single-
File System (SFS) with conversion.
In [17] we have
already elaborated on the special properties of porous
structures such as zeolites. The one-dimensional nature
of the zeolite channel leads to extraordinary eﬀects on the
kinetic properties of these materials. These structures
are modelled by one-dimensional systems called Single-
File Systems where particles are not able to pass each
other. In [17] we have focused on the steady-state prop-
erties of a SFS with conversion. The process of diﬀusion
in SFS has diﬀerent characteristics as ordinary diﬀusion,
which aﬀects the nature of both transport and conversion
by chemical reactions. We are investigating the kinetic
properties of this system, and, more precisely, we are in-
terested in the properties of the system before reaching
equilibrium (the transient or relaxation regime).

Diﬀerent methods and techniques have been described
in the literature to solve the ME exactly. [8, 12, 18]
In spite of the remarkable progress in the ﬁeld of
exactly solvable non-equilibrium processes, the major-
ity of reaction-diﬀusion models cannot be solved ex-
actly. [19, 20] It is therefore necessary to use approxima-
tion techniques in order to describe their essential prop-
erties (e.g. Mean-Field Approximation, Cluster Approx-
imation). [21] Also, as was already realized by Smolu-
chowski, [22] ﬂuctuations and correlations may be ex-
tremely important in low-dimensional systems where the
diﬀusive mixing is not strong. Therefore, these approxi-
mation techniques can give results that deviate strongly
from the system behavior. Dynamic Monte Carlo meth-
ods are used to simulate the system according to the ME.
Few researchers have concentrated on the properties
of the system in the transient regime and only studied
the reactivity of the system in this regime. Moreover,
few research has been done for an open system where
adsorption/desorption is present at the marginal sites.
The reason that many of the analytical approaches fail is
because of the asymmetry of the system.

In the present work we focus on the non-equilibrium

phase properties of SFS with conversion. We study the
relaxation time of the system (time evolution of the sys-
tem properties, starting with no particles) for diﬀerent
sets of kinetic parameters, lengths of the pipe and dis-
tributions of the reactive sites. In the transient regime
we observe that MF results are close to the DMC results
both for slow and fast reaction systems. We outline the
cases for which the diﬀerences are signiﬁcant. We com-
pare with the steady-state situation in which the MF
was not describing the Single-File eﬀects properly. [17]
We analyze the situations when analytical results can be
derived, and we compare these results with Mean-Field
(MF) and Dynamic Monte Carlo (DMC) results. We
look at the relaxation of the total loading, loading with
diﬀerent components, occupancies of individual sites for
various parameters and diﬀerent distributions of the re-
active sites. As MF is a coarse approximation, for the
analysis of proﬁle occupancies we introduce a better ap-
proximation (Cluster Approximation). We analyse the
results using diﬀerent analytic methods such as pair and
MF approximation. Pair Approximation and MF Ap-
proximation tend to give similar results due to the high-
order correlations in the system. We investigate the eﬀect
of various model assumptions made about diﬀusion, ad-
sorption, desorption and reaction on the kinetic behavior
of the system.

In section II we specify our mathematical model to-
gether with the theoretical background for analytical and
simulation results. In section III A we present the vari-
ous results for transient regimes for the simpliﬁed model
without conversion. We solve numerically and analyti-
cally the Master Equation in order to get the relaxation

ory to simplify the rate equations [17] of the system for
the case when all the sites have the same activity to-
wards conversion. We present the results obtained using
DMC simulations for the case with conversion when all
the sites are reactive in section III C 1, and when only
some of the sites are reactive in section III C 2. For all
of these cases we compare the DMC results with MF and
Pair Approximation results. The inﬂuence of the posi-
tion of the reactive sites is also outlined. The last section
summarizes our main conclusions.

II. THEORY

In this section we give the theoretical background for
our analytical and simulation results. First we specify
our model and then we show that the deﬁned system
obeys a Master Equation (ME). We derive then a set of
exact rate equations from the Master Equation of the
system describing the reaction kinetics. We look at the
properties of the system in the transient regime by solv-
ing these rate equations. In order to do this we have to
use approximation techniques. We use MF analysis and
we derive a set of equations that we can solve numeri-
cally. Because MF is a strong simpliﬁcation and neglects

all spatial correlations in the system, we introduce an-
other approximation called the Cluster Approximation.
We have also simulated the system governed by the ME
using DMC simulations.

A. The Model

We model a Single-File System by a one-dimensional
array of sites, each possibly occupied by an adsorbate.
This is the model of diﬀusion and reaction in a one-
dimensional arrangements of particles with hard-core in-
teraction. The sites are numbered 1, 2, . . . , S. A particle
can only move to the right or to the left if an adjacent
site is vacant. The sites could be reactive and unreactive
and we note with Nprot the number of reactive sites. A
reactive site is the only place where a conversion may
take place.

We consider two types of adsorbates, A and B,
in
our model and we denote with Y the site occupation
of a site, Y=(∗, A, B), which stands for a vacant
site, a site occupied by A, or a site occupied by a B,
respectively. We restrict ourselves to the following
mono- and bi-molecular transitions.

a) Adsorption and desorption

Adsorption and desorption take place only at the
two marginal sites i.e., the left and rightmost sites at
the ends of the system.

A(gas) + ∗m −→ Am
Am −→ A(gas) + ∗m
Bm −→ B(gas) + ∗m ,

where subscripts m denotes a marginal site. Note that
there is no B adsorption. B’s can only be formed by
conversion.

b) Diﬀusion

In the pipe, particles are allowed to diﬀuse via hopping
to vacant nearest neighbor sites.

An + ∗n+1 ←→ ∗n + An+1
Bn + ∗n+1 ←→ ∗n + Bn+1

where the subscripts are site indices: n= 1, 2, . . . , S-1.

c) Conversion

An A can transform into a B at a reactive site.

Ar −→ Br .

In the initial state of the system all the sites are va-
cant (no particles in the pipe) as we are interested in the
behavior of the system towards equilibrium.

B. Master Equation

From this follows the rate equation

Reaction kinetics is described by a stochastic process.
Every reaction has a microscopic rate constant associated
with it that is the probability per unit time that the
reaction occurs. Stochastic models of physical systems
can be described by a Master Equation. [23]

By α, β, we will indicate a particular conﬁguration of
the system i.e., a particular way to distribute adsorbates
over all the sites. Pα(t) will indicate the probability of
ﬁnding the system in conﬁguration α at time t and Wαβ is
the rate constant of the reaction changing conﬁguration
β to conﬁguration α.

The probability of the system being in conﬁguration
α at time t + dt can be expressed as the sum of two
terms. The ﬁrst term is the probability to ﬁnd the sys-
tem already in conﬁguration α at time t multiplied by
the probability to stay in this conﬁguration during dt.
The second term is the probability to ﬁnd the system in
some other conﬁguration β at time t multiplied by the
probability to go from β to α during dt.

C. Analytical methods

1. Rate equations

Starting from the Master Equation (2) and using ex-
pression (4) the rate equations of the system are de-
rived. [17] We denote by Wads, Wdes, Wdiﬀ the rate
constants of adsorption, desorption and diﬀusion respec-
tively. For simplicity we assume that the rate constants
of A and B desorption are equal, and also the rate con-
stants of A and B diﬀusion are equal. We denote by hYni
the probability that a particle of type Y is on site n, and
with hYnYn+1i the probability that a particle of type
Y is at site n and one at site n + 1, where Y=(∗,A,B).
The coeﬃcients ∆n, where n=1, 2,. . . , S, are 1 if site
n is reactive and 0 otherwise. The rate equations for a
non-marginal site are

= Wdiﬀ [−hAn∗n+1i − h∗n−1Ani + hAn−1∗ni

[WαβPβ (t) − WβαPα(t)] .

(2)

+ h∗nAn+1i] − ∆nWrxhAni.

For hBni we get similarly

Analytical results can be derived as follows. The value
of a property X is a weighted average over the values Xα
which is the value of X in conﬁguration α:

dhAni
dt

dhBni

= Wdiﬀ [−hBn∗n+1i − h∗n−1Bni + hBn−1∗ni

+ h∗nBn+1i] + ∆nWrxhAni.

(6)

hXi =

(3)

The marginal sites also have adsorption and desorption.
They can be dealt with similary as the conversion. The

rate equations for A are

dhA1i

dhASi
dt

= Wdiﬀ [−hA1∗2i + h∗1A2i] + Wadsh∗1i

− WdeshA1i − ∆1WrxhA1i,

= Wdiﬀ [−h∗S−1ASi + h∗SAS−1i] + Wadsh∗Si

− WdeshASi − ∆SWrxhASi,

and the rate equations for B

dhB1i
dt
dhBSi
dt

= Wdiﬀ [−hB1∗2i + h∗1B2i] − WdeshB1i + ∆1WrxhA1i,

= Wdiﬀ [−h∗S−1ASi + hAS−1∗Si] − WdeshB1i

+ ∆SWrxhASi.

Note that these coupled sets of diﬀerential equations

are exact, but not closed.

(7)

(8)

To solve this coupled set of diﬀerential equations, we
need to make an approximation for the two-site prob-
abilities such as hAn∗n+1i,hBn∗n+1i, etc. The closure
relation

hXi =

hXY i

XY

which we approximate. This leads to a so-called Cluster
Approximation. The closure relation

hXY i =

hXY Zi

(11)

XZ

should now hold for any approximation. We denote here
with X the occupation of site n, with Y the occupation
of site n + 1, and with Z the occupation of site n + 2.

There are various decoupling scheme used in the lit-
erature [2, 4, 6, 18, 24] as approximations for the n-site
probabilities. For many of these decoupling schemes the
closure relation (11) no longer holds. For simplicity we
will use the simplest Cluster Approximation, called Pair
Approximation for which only the correlations between
pairs of nearest neighbors (NN) are considered.

The decoupling scheme for our pair Approximation is

hXY Zi =

hXY ihY Zi
hY i

.

It is straightforward to see that the closure relation (11)
holds.

hXY Zi =

hY Zi =

hXY ihY i = hXY i.

After decoupling, this system of coupled sets of diﬀeren-
tial equations, consisting of the rate equations for one-
site and two-site probabilities, becomes closed and can
be solved numerically.

(9)

should hold for any approximation for these two-site
probabilities. We denote with X the occupation of site
n and with Y the occupation of site n + 1. The simplest
approximation is

hXY i = hXihY i,

(10)

i.e. neighboring sites are considered independent.

The

two-site

probabilities

become
[21]
hAn∗n+1i=hAnih∗n+1i,
This approximation is called the Mean-Field Approx-
imation and gives us a coupled set of diﬀerential
equations that we can solve numerically.

hBn∗n+1i=hBnih∗n+1i.

then

3. Cluster Approximation

The MF Approximation is a strong simpliﬁcation be-
cause it neglects all spatial correlations in the system.
Because the system we analyze is one-dimensional, the
correlations might be signiﬁcant and important. The ob-
vious possibility to eliminate the weakness of the MF
approach is to introduce another approximation.

Instead of using MF Approximation for the two-site
probabilities, we write down their rate equations (see ap-
pendix). These equations have three-site probabilities

D. Dynamic Monte Carlo

We have seen that we can derive approximate analyt-
ical solutions to the Master Equation. DMC methods
allow us to simulate the system governed by the Mas-
ter Equation over time. We simplify the notation of
the Master Equation by deﬁning a matrix W contain-
ing the rate constants Wαβ, and a diagonal matrix R by
γ Wγβ, if α = β, and 0 otherwise. If we put the
Rαβ ≡
probabilities of the conﬁgurations Pα in a vector P, we
can write the Master Equation as

P

dP
dt

= −(R − W)P.

(14)

where R and W are time independent. We also introduce
a new matrix Q, Q(t) ≡ exp[−Rt]. This matrix is time
dependent by deﬁnition and we can rewrite the Master
Equation in the integral form

P(t) = Q(t)P(0) +

dt′Q(t − t′)WP(t′).

(15)

By substitution we get from the right-hand-side for P (t′)

(16)

Suppose at t = 0 the system is in conﬁguration α
with probability Pα(0). The probability that, at time
t, the system is still
in conﬁguration α is given by
Qαα(t)Pα(0) = exp(−Rααt)Pα(0). This shows that the
ﬁrst term represents the contribution to the probabilities
when no reaction takes place up to time t. The ma-
trix W determines how the probabilities change when
a reaction takes place. The second term represents the
contribution to the probabilities when no reaction takes
place between times 0 and t′, some reaction takes place at
time t′, and then no reaction takes place between t′ and t.
The subsequent terms represent contributions when two,
three, four, etc. reactions take place. The idea of the
DMC method is not to compute probabilities Pα(t) ex-
plicitly, but to start with some particular conﬁguration,
representative for the initial state of the experiment one
wants to simulate, and then generate a sequence of other
conﬁgurations with the correct probability. The method
generates a time t′ when the ﬁrst reaction occurs accord-
ing to the probability distribution 1 − exp[−Rααt]. At
time t′ a reaction takes place such that a new conﬁgura-
tion α′ is generated by picking it out of all possible new
conﬁgurations β with a probability proportional to Wα′α.
At this point we can proceed by repeating the previous
steps, drawing again a time for a new reaction and a new
conﬁguration. [25, 26]

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

In [17] various results for the system with conversion
(Wrx 6= 0) and without conversion(Wrx = 0) were re-
ported. In case Wrx = 0 we have only A particles in the
system. The total loading (Q) of the system is deﬁned as
the average number of particles per site. In case Wrx 6= 0
we have B’s as well in the system. In this case, the total
loading (Q), is the sum of the loading with A particles
(QA) and loading with B particles (QB)

A. No conversion

We are interested in the relaxation time of the system
(transients). We start with the evolution of the total
loading over time starting from a system with no particles
at all. As the total loading is the same for the case with
and without conversion, we will consider for simplicity
the case with no conversion ﬁrst.

As we can derive a ﬁnite set of exact rate equa-
tions(5,6,7,8) it’s not necessary to work with the Master
the probability that

There are two cases to be distinguished.

If f ≥ 4
then both solutions are real. Because this is the same

eigenvectors with fast relaxation (large ω). As we are
interested in the slowest relaxation (small ω) we will look
at the other case f < 4 or ω < 4λ. The two solutions
are then each others complex conjugate. (Note for the
following that f ≥ 0.)

Fast diﬀusion or slow relaxation.

In this case we can write the solutions as

In fact the equation for
z shows that when z is a solution, then so is 1/z. This
means that r = 1, or

This has indeed only solutions for 0 ≤ f ≤ 4.

Removing the time dependence yields relaxation times.
We see that we have obtained an eigenvalue equation.
The eigenvalues ω are the reciprocal of relaxation times
for the corresponding eigenvectors. The relaxation time
of the system as a whole(trel) is the reciprocal of the
smallest eigenvalue. We can get this time by simply nu-
merically solving the eigenvalue equation for given S and
λ.

Solving the eigenvalue equation analytically.

For some special cases analytical expressions for the

eigenvalues can be given. We consider the ansatz

an = zn.

(30)

Because there are two solutions for z, the solution for

an is a linear combination of these two solutions: i.e.,

an = c1einϕ + c2e−inϕ.

(37)

From equation (28) we remark that an should be al-
ways real. This means that c1 is the complex conjugate of
c2. The coeﬃcients will follow from the equations for the
marginal sites. There are two of these equations. The
equation above for cos ϕ is a third equation. We have
four unknowns (c1, c2, ω, and ϕ), but, as only the ratio
between the coeﬃcients can be determined, we should
eﬀectively be able to determine all of them.

Substitution of the expression for an in the equations
for the marginal sites taking into account that c1 and c2
are complex conjugate (c1 = c1R + ic1I), leads to

The ﬁrst term is the probability of a particle to be ad-

ability of a particle to be desorbed at the two open ends.
The probability of a particle to be adsorbed to one end
equals the adsorption rate constant (Wads) times the
probability to have there a vacancy (1-

probability of a particle to be desorbed equals the desorp-

This limiting value is the same as the one indicated
by the convergence of the curves in ﬁgure 2. The other
parameter that inﬂuence the relaxation time trel is the
length of the pipe S. For diﬀusion very fast, trel increases
linearly with S (see ﬁgure 3).

We can eliminate ω using cos ϕ = 1 − f /2.

Using ϕ as parameter in equation (39), ϕ ∈ [0, π), we
can get the λ’s. Equations (35) and (32) gives us the ω’s.
We get in this way ω as a function of λ, coupled by the
parameter ϕ (see ﬁgure 2c).

Solving the eigenvalue equation for the total loading, in
the case λ → ∞

We solve the eigenvalue equation numerically in or-
der to get the relaxation time of a system. We want
to describe how the relaxation time of the total loading
(trel) depends on system parameters like reaction, ad-
sorption/desorption, diﬀusion rate constants and system
size S. In ﬁgure 2 we show the inﬂuence of diﬀusion on
the relaxation time for a system of size S=30. Note that
there are two regimes describing the dependence on dif-
fusion of the relaxation time trel. The ﬁrst regime is for
slow diﬀusion, when trel decreases rapidly with increas-
ing diﬀusion, and the second for fast diﬀusion, when trel
slowly decreases with diﬀusion to a limiting value.

Because diﬀusion is inﬁnitely-fast all the sites have the
same probability to be occupied and the system is ho-
mogeneous. We can then analytically derive the limiting

B. Conversion

In the case with no conversion, we have derived a set
of exact equations and we have simpliﬁed the rate equa-

tions to homogeneous linear ODE’s. Including conversion
in our model, the two-site probabilities can not be elim-
inated and an approximation is needed. We use the MF
Approximation and we get a coupled set of diﬀerential
equations that we can solve numerically. In ﬁgure 4, from
the MF results for the transients, we observe that there
are two diﬀerent behaviors determined by conversion.

For fast reaction systems (see ﬁgure 4a), the relaxation
time of the loading with A’s (trelA) and B’s (trelB) is
equal to the relaxation time of the total loading (trel).
This means that when Q has reached equilibrium, QA
and QB have also reached equilibrium.

For slow reaction systems (see ﬁgure 4b), the total
loading Q relaxes faster to equilibrium than the load-
ing with A’s (QA) and B’s (QB). The regime between
Q reaching equilibrium and QA and QB reaching equilib-
rium we call the reaction limited regime.

We remark that for slow reaction systems in the
reaction limited regime, the vacancy probability can
be replaced with the steady-state expression h∗ni=
Wdes/(Wads + Wdes). The set of equations for the case
when all the sites are reactive then becomes

We can use these approximate MF equations for the
problem of relaxation of A and B loadings for the case
when the total loading has already reached steady-state.
The equations for A’s can be written as

dhAi
dt

= M′hAi + v′,

(44)

where hAi is a vector containing the occupacy probabil-
ities with A’s, M′ is the matrix of coeﬃcients and v′

is the vector that makes this systems non-homogeneous
having the non-zero elements for indices 1 and S. We
substitute hAi = hAiss + c in the rate equations (47),
where c is the vector with the deviations of the site occu-
pancy probabilities with A’s from the steady-state. The
substitution yields

dc
dt

= M′ [hAiss + c] + v′

= M′c + M′hAiss + v′
= M′c,

(45)

because M′hAiss + v = 0 by deﬁnition.

The equations in c are homogeneous and the matrix
of coeﬃcients is the same as the one in the original rate
equations. We can obtain the eigenvalue equation by
making the substitution

c = c′e−ωt

(46)

and taking out the exponential from the equations. The
relaxation time of the A loading(QA) is then the recip-
rocal of the smallest eigenvalue. We can get this time by
simply numerically solving the eigenvalue equation.

Solving the eigenvalue equation for the case with
conversion

For fast reaction systems we have seen that using MF,
the A and B loadings have the same relaxation, which
is the relaxation of the total loading Q (see ﬁgure 4a).
The relaxation of QA can be thus derived from exact
equations (13,14). For slow reaction systems we can de-
rive analytically the relaxation of QA and QB for the
reaction limited regime. In this case we expect the relax-
ation of QA and QB to be determined only by reaction.
From the MF results we remark that desorption has also
a strong inﬂuence on the transients (see ﬁgure 4c). This
is happening because, in the case desorption is very high,
the adsorbed particles at the marginal sites will hardly
diﬀuse into the pipe, most of them being desorbed imme-
diately. As a result, few particles will succeed in getting
to the middle sites and the residence time of the parti-
cles near the marginal sites will decrease. The loading
of the pipe with particles will converge than slower to
steady-state. In ﬁgure 5 we can see that the analytical
results for the transients obtained solving the eigenvalue
equation corresponds to the numerical results obtained
using the MF Approximation for the case all the sites
are reactive. In ﬁgure 6 we have analytical results from
the eigenvalue equation and MF results for the system
in reaction limited regime and for diﬀerent distributions
of the reactive sites. We observe that for marginal sites
reactive the results are similar but diﬀer considerably for
the middle sites reactive and for the homogeneous distri-
bution of the reactive sites.

Analytically, solving the eigenvalue equation for a very
slow reaction system, we ﬁnd that the relaxation of QA

(trelA) as a function of desorption varies with reaction
for low desorption rates and converges to a limiting value
for very high rates of desorption (see ﬁgure 7-a,b). The
dependence of A loading on Wdes has two regimes, the
ﬁrst for low desorption rates when A loading strongly
decreases with desorption, and the second when the A
loading is converging to a limiting value and the adsorp-
tion process takes over the system behavior.

We remark that the analytical results for QA obtained
from the eigenvalue equation don’t give the MF peak of
A’s particles accumulated in the transient regime for a
slow reaction system.

C. Comparisons with simulation results

We present now the results obtained for the transients
using DMC methods for diﬀerent sets of parameters. We
compare them with the Mean-Field and Pair Approxima-

tion results. As for very large pipes the computational
eﬀort is considerable, we study a system of size S = 30.
We have considered separately the sets of parameters in
Table I.

The sets of parameters from a) to e) are for the cases
of low loading and from f) to j) for high loading. The
parameters in the table describe the following situations:
a) and f) for very slow reaction and slow diﬀusion; b) and
g) for slow reaction and slow diﬀusion; c) and h) for slow
reaction and fast diﬀusion; d) and i) for fast reaction
and slow diﬀusion; e) and j) for fast reaction and fast
diﬀusion.

As the MF results for the total loading are exact, there
are, as expected, no diﬀerences between these results and
those of the simulation for the total loading. We compare
the MF results with the simulation results for the case
with conversion in the case all sites are reactive and when
only some of the sites reactive.

and the dashed line is for the MF results. We have marked with * the diﬀerence between the current value and the steady-state
value of the parameter.

lation results in ﬁgures 8 and 9 we see several regimes
for the transients.
In the case diﬀusion is slow, the re-
laxation time is determined by diﬀusion. When diﬀusion
is fast and the reaction slow, then the relaxation time is
determined by reaction and when both are fast, relax-
ation time is determined by adsorption/desorption. For
all these cases the simulations results for the transients
match the MF results, except when we have low reaction
rates and fast diﬀusion for both low and high loading.

When diﬀusion is fast and reaction is slow, MF overes-
timates the amount of A’s in the pipe both for transients
and for steady-state. DMC and MF results indicate an
overshoot for QA both for high and low loadings in the
transient regime. The overshooting appears as a conse-
quence of the diﬀerence between diﬀusion and reaction
rates constants. Because the reaction is slow and diﬀu-
sion fast, many A’s start accumulating into the system
and they are only later converted into B’s. The moment
tmax when the peak appears is determined by the ratio
between Wdiﬀ and S, but always shortly after the initial
moment t0 and it lasts only a short time. The height of
the peak depends on the total loading (Wads/Wdes) (see
ﬁgure 10) and on the ratio between Wrx and Wdiﬀ (see
ﬁgure 11 and 12). For the case of slow reaction and fast
diﬀusion(f,g,h) in table II, the higher the peak, the lower
the ratio between Wrx and Wdiﬀ .
In the table II we give
the relative height of the peak (∆H/QA) for diﬀerent
Wrx and Wdiﬀ , at high loading (Wads = 0.8, Wdes = 0.2),
where ∆H is the height of the peak.

MF overestimates the height of this peak comparing
with simulation results, but both DMC and MF results
converge in the same way to steady-state. In ﬁgure 13
we show that MF results corresponds to DMC results for
transients for slow reaction systems. When difussion is
slow and reaction is fast, MF predicts very well the DMC

results. We have also in this case an overshoot for QA in
the transient regime. When we have slow diﬀusion and
very slow reaction, the height of the peak increases with
both Wrx and Wdiﬀ (see table II for d, e, f). Also in this
case the MF corresponds to the DMC results.

As MF ignores the spatial correlations between NN
sites and MF gives qualitatively good results comparing
with DMC results, we conclude that MF is a good enough
approximation for the case when all the sites are reactive.
This is conﬁrmed also by the comparison between MF
and Pair Approximation. The Pair Approximation gives
the same results as MF.

2. Only some of the sites reactive

We want to see how the distribution of the reactive
sites inﬂuence the relaxation of A and B loadings. We
compare the MF and the DMC results for fast reaction
and for slow reaction systems, for diﬀerent distributions
of the reactive sites. We distinguish homogeneous distri-
bution of the reactive sites, marginal sites reactive, and
middle sites reactive).

We have previously seen that for fast reaction systems
and all sites reactive, the relaxation of QA and QB is the
same as the relaxation of the total loading Q. From [17]
we know that the results for the total loading, both for
transients and for steady-state, can be derived analyti-
cally from exact equations and these results corresponds
to the DMC results. When only the marginal sites are
reactive and reaction very fast, DMC and MF results are
similar with DMC and MF results for the cases when all
sites are reactive and when it is a homogeneous distribu-
tion of the reactive sites in the pipe. When the reactive
sites are situated in the middle of the pipe, the loadings
Q, QA,and QB relax slower to equilibrium than in the
case all the sites are reactive, because it takes more time
for the A particles to reach the reactive sites.

For slow reaction systems and all sites reactive, the
relaxation of QA and QB is slower than the relaxation
of the total loading Q. For this case we can not derive
QA from exact equations. The A loading is converging to
equilibrium simultaneously with B loading. We compare
thus DMC and MF results for diﬀerent distributions of
the reactive sites, for diﬀerent reaction rates. We will
analyze two cases, the ﬁrst for slow reaction (Wrx = 0.1)
and the second for very slow reaction (Wrx = 0.01).

In the ﬁrst case (Wrx = 0.1), the B loading for ho-
mogenous distribution and middle site reactive reaches

equilibrium faster than in the case of marginal sites re-
active. This is happening because for marginal sites re-
active, the B’s are formed near the open ends and, con-
sequently, they can easily desorb and the equilibrium is
reached later. When the marginal sites are reactive, the
residence time of the B’s is small and the probability to
ﬁnd a B on a marginal site is high. The loading with B’s
is increasing more slowly to the steady-state value be-
cause of the A’s that are in the middle of the pipe. The
same behavior has the A loading converging to equilib-
rium simultaneously with B loading. When the reactive
sites are distributed in the middle of the pipe, because of
blocking, the B’s can not reach easily the open ends, the
probability to ﬁnd a B on a marginal site is small, and the
residence time of the B’s in the system is large. The load-
ing with B’s is increasing fast to the steady-state value.
From ﬁgure 14, we see that QA and QB for homogeneous
and middle sites reactive have the same relaxation.

In the case of very slow reaction (Wrx = 0.01), when
the marginal sites are reactive, the B loading increases
faster than in the case of homogeneous and middle sites
reactive, till a certain time because A particles can reach
faster the reactive sites. While more B’s are formed, the
B loading is converging slower because the B’s can desorb
relatively fast from the marginal sites, the residence time
of the formed B’s is smaller than in the case when the
reactive sites are in the middle of the pipe or homoge-
neously distributed (see ﬁgure 14). QB converges faster
in case the middle sites are reactive than in the case of
homogeneous distribution of the reactive sites.

We compare the time dependence of the A loading and
of the B loading using DMC and MF for slow reaction
systems and diﬀerent rates of conversion when diﬀusion
is fast (see ﬁgure 15). We see that diﬀerences appear in
the transient region as well as in the steady-state for all
the distributions of the reactive sites but very prominent
for marginal and middle sites reactive. In this case, for
homogeneous distribution of the reactive sites the diﬀer-

ences between MF and DMC are small (see ﬁgure 16).

For the other cases (fast reaction-slow diﬀusion, fast
reaction-fast diﬀusion, slow reaction-slow diﬀusion), MF
gives good results compared to DMC for all the distri-
butions of the reactive sites.
In ﬁgure 17 we compare
the MF results for the transients for the case when ﬁve
marginal sites are reactive.

We ﬁnally look at the site occupancy of the pipe. The
MF proﬁles for marginal sites reactive show in the tran-
sient regime accumulation of the A’s in the middle of the
pipe for a slow reaction system and fast diﬀusion. Be-
cause reaction is slow, the A’s can pass without reacting
to the nonreactive sites. As the loading is increasing, the
residence time of the particles increases, and the proba-
bility to ﬁnd an A in the middle of the pipe is decreasing
because of blocking (see ﬁgure 18).

Dynamic Monte Carlo simulations show the same be-
havior. In ﬁgure 19 we see as well accumulation of A par-
ticles in the middle of the pipe in the transient regime.
As a consequence, until the equilibrium is reached the
middle sites have diﬀerent contribution to the occupancy
in the pipe depending on their position. In the steady-
state all the middle sites have the same contribution to
the occupancy proﬁles [17].

SUMMARY

We have used DMC and analytical techniques to study
the properties of Single-File Systems in the transient
regime.

We have derived exact equations to solve the relaxation
time of the whole system (trel). We found that there are
two regimes describing the dependence on diﬀusion of the
relaxation time trel. The ﬁrst regime is for slow diﬀusion,
when trel decreases fast with increasing diﬀusion, and the
second for fast diﬀusion, when trel slowly decreases with
diﬀusion to a limiting value. We have analytically derived
this limiting value of trel for inﬁnitely-fast diﬀusion.

We have also studied the transients in the case with
conversion. MF results show that there are two diﬀer-
ent behaviors determined by conversion. For fast reac-
tion systems, the relaxation time of the loading with A’s
(trelA) and B’s (trelB) is equal to the relaxation time of
the total loading (trel). When Q has reached equilib-
rium, QA and QB have also reached equilibrium. For
slow reaction systems, the total loading Q relaxes faster
to equilibrium than the loading with A’s (QA) and B’s
(QB). The regime between Q reaching equilibrium and
QA and QB reaching equilibrium we call the reaction lim-
ited regime. In the reaction limited regime, MF shows
that not only reaction, but also desorption has a strong
inﬂuence inﬂuence on the transients. We ﬁnd that the re-
laxation of QA (trelA) as a function of desorption varies
with reaction for low desorption rates and converges to a
limiting value for very high rates of desorption.

DMC results shows several regimes for the transients,
in the case all the sites are reactive. In the case diﬀu-

sion is slow, the relaxation time is determined by dif-
fusion. When diﬀusion is fast and the reaction slow,
then the relaxation time is determined by reaction and
when both are fast, relaxation time is determined by ad-
sorption/desorption. For all these cases the simulations
results for the transients match the MF results, except
when we have low reaction rates and fast diﬀusion for
both low and high loading.
In this case MF overesti-
mates the amount of A’s in the pipe both for transients
and for steady-state. DMC and MF results indicate also
an overshoot for QA both for high and low loadings in
the transient regime, that appears as a consequence of
the diﬀerence between diﬀusion and reaction rates con-
stants.

When only some of sites are reactive, for fast reaction
systems, MF gives good results compared to DMC for
all the distributions of the reactive sites. When only the
marginal sites are reactive and reaction very fast, DMC
and MF results are similar with DMC and MF results
for the cases when all sites are reactive and when it is
a homogeneous distribution of the reactive sites in the
pipe. When the reactive sites are situated in the middle
of the pipe, the loadings Q, QA, and QB relax slower to

equilibrium than in the case all the sites are reactive,
because it takes more time for the A particles to reach
the reactive sites.

For slow reactive systems, diﬀerences between DMC
and MF results appear for transients for diﬀerent distri-
butions of the reactive sites when diﬀusion is fast, but
are very prominent for marginal and middle sites reac-
tive. For homogeneous distribution of the reactive sites
the diﬀerences between MF and DMC are small. For
slow reaction, we ﬁnd that the B loading for homogenous
distribution and middle site reactive reaches equilibrium
faster than in the case of marginal sites reactive. For very
slow reaction, QB increases faster at the beginning than
in the case of homogeneous and middle sites reactive and
becomes slower as the B’s are formed. QB converges also
faster in the case the middle sites are reactive than in the
case of homogeneous distribution of the reactive sites.

A. Derivation of the equations for two-sites
probabilities

In order to solve the rate equations of the system we
use Cluster Approximation. For simplicity we consider
an approximation that considers only the correlations be-
tween pairs of NN sites - Pair Approximation. To the al-
ready derived rate equations for one-site probabilities we
add the two-site probability equations. We write write
these equations in terms of three sites probabilities and
we use then the decoupling scheme

hXY ihY Zi

Almost similar are the equations for the right marginal

sites

We have the possibility to determine the one-site proba-
bilities by calculating the sum of the two-sites probabili-

ties

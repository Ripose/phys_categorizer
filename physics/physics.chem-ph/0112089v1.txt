Abstract

We investigate the method to combine the techniques of quantum chemisty

with QED. In our theory, we treat the N-electron system and the Dirac sea on

an equal footing; we regard both of them as the dynamical degrees of freedom

of a many-body system. After the introduction of our QED-SCF method, the

QED-SCF solutions are classiﬁed into several classes on the basis of group-

theoretical operations such as time reversal, parity and O(3) rotational sym-

metry. The natural orbitals of general QED-SCF solutions are determined

by diagonalizing the ﬁrst order density matrix. Thus, we obtain the possibil-

ity to treat the system under strong QED eﬀect by the methods of quantum

chemistry, such as QED-MCSCF and QED-coupled-cluster approaches.

I. INTRODUCTION

The Hartree-Fock ( HF ) and multiconﬁguration HF ( MCHF ) methods have been well-

established for nonrelativistic Hamiltonian, and the self-consistent ﬁeld ( SCF ) equations

to obtain the HF and MCHF solutions are also derived in several ways [1]. The most general

HF solution for the nonrelativistic case is given by the general spin orbitals ( GSO ): The

Very recently we have developed the program package for ab initio HF and density functional

( DFT ) calculations of molecules by using the GSO [4,5].

It was shown that GSO HF

and GSO DFT approaches are useful for qualitative understanding of correlation and spin

correlation eﬀects in polyradicals with orbital degeneracies [4,5].

By the way, it is a well-known fact that, in atomic and moleculer physics, the relativistic

eﬀects become crucial in many cases. Especially in the electronic structure calculation for

heavy elements, we have to introduce a kind of relativistic treatment. For example, the case

of neutral heavy elements can be treated satisfactorily by the Dirac-Coulomb-Breit no-sea

scheme [6]. This method is based on the no-sea (the approximation completely neglects

the eﬀects of the Dirac sea) Hamiltonian. It has a Dirac-type one-body Hamiltonian, and

the interaction of electrons is treated via the Coulomb potential and Breit operator [7].

This Hamiltonian with several many-body schemes (HF, relativistic many-body perturbation

theory ( RMBPT ), so on) give good numerical results for neutral heavy elements in atoms

and molecules. But, especially in the case of highly charged heavy elements, the accurate

second-order RMBPT indicates that quantum electrodynamical ( QED ) corrections are

clearly seen in the diﬀerence between RMBPT and experiment. Various relativistic schemes

have already been presented in the electronic structure theory, and they are summarized in

recent review articles [6,8,9].

In the previous paper [10], we constructed the theory of quantum electrodynamical self-

consistent ﬁelds ( QED-SCF ). We derived the time-dependent Hartree-Fock ( TDHF )

theory, HF condition and random phase approximation ( RPA ) [11,12]. Because we con-

structed our theory based on QED, we regard them as an intrinsic treatment of relativistic

theory in atomic and moleculer physics. In this theory, we treat an N-electron system and

2

the Dirac sea on an equal footing, and they interact by exchanging photons. Thus our theory

can treat the QED eﬀects such as the vacuum polarization eﬀect, which will be observed

around the nucleus of heavy element ( strong external Coulomb ﬁeld ) [8,9,13]. To describe

the QED eﬀects, we have to treat not only N-electron system but also the Dirac sea as the

dynamical degrees of freedom in a many-body system. Futhermore, because we gain the

ability to introduce various many-body techniques of atoms and molecules to QED, we can

discuss the availabilities of post-HF scheme through consideration of the QED-HF stability

condition, like the GSO model in the nonrelativistic theory.

This paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we give a brief summary of our method to

combine many-body techniques to QED. In Sec. III, we perform group-theoretical character-

izations of QED-SCF solutions [10] on the basis of time-reversal, parity and O(3) rotational

symmetry. Under these group-operations, the ﬁrst-order density matrix of these solutions

is classiﬁed into several diﬀerent classes. In Sec. IV, we give some examples to apply our

method to quantum chemistry. We examine the post QED-SCF methods as in the case of

post HF methods in quantum chemistry. The MBPT, coupled-cluster ( CC ) and MCSCF

methods are considered in the QED scheme. To this end, we utilize previous procedures

for the nonrelativistic case [14]: (1) Use of density matrix, (2) its diagonalization to obtain

the natural orbitals given by four-component bispinor, and (3) selection of active space for

MCSCF. Finally in Sec. V, we give discussion about this work.

II. QED-HF THEORY

In this section, we give a brief summary of our QED-SCF method which has been inves-

tigated in previous paper [10]. Our QED-SCF method is based on three factors: First, we

introduce a QED Hamiltonian written by products of the one-particle operators ( creation-

annihilation operators ). Second, we introduce an assumption for evaluation of matrix

elements. Third, we use the Thouless form for the determinantal state [11,15]. By intro-

ducing these three tools, it becomes possible to combine various many-body techniques with

3

QED.

A. Hamiltonian

We start from the following Lagrangian

L(x) = −

Fµν(x)F µν(x) + ¯ψ(x)(iγµ∂µ − m0)ψ(x) + e ¯ψ(x)γµψ(x)(Aµ(x) + A(e)

µ (x)).

Here, Aµ is a ( virtual ) photon ﬁeld which describes the interaction between fermions, and

A(e)

µ is a classical external ﬁeld. Next we remove the photon degree of freedom and introduce

a Coulomb potential U(r) of a nucleus ( or nuclei ) as the external ﬁeld. Then we obtain

the following Hamiltonian:

ˆH =

Here each ﬁeld is quantized. Dµν(x − y) is the full photon propagator. The γ-matrices are

deﬁned by ( under the standard representation )

where I is the unit matrix, and σi ( i=1,2,3 ) is the Pauli matrix:

In the above Hamiltonian, we expand each ﬁeld operator by one-particle state function as

Here, ∆ǫ = |ǫk − ǫl| = |ǫi − ǫj| ( the energy diﬀerence of one-particle states ). gµν is

usual metric tensor and deﬁned as gµν = diag(1, −1, −1, −1). About the interaction, we

only take into account 0th order bare photon propagator, and choose the Feynman gauge

for convenience. This Hamiltonian can describes the QED eﬀects such as the vacuum-

polarization, because which includes the Dirac sea as the dynamical degree of freedom.

Hereafter we use this Hamiltonian in our theory.

Next we give the method for evaluation of expectation value. In QED, the Dirac vacuum

under the presence of the external Coulomb ﬁeld generates 4-current as an observed eﬀect,

which is called the vacuum polarization [8,9,13]. It is well-known that, this eﬀect is described

by the charge conjugation symmetric 4-current given in the next form [8,9,13]

This expression gives the 4-current induced by the external Coulomb ﬁeld. In this expression,

in the external-ﬁeld-free case two sums cancel, but for the ﬁeld present case two sums do

not cancel completely. Hereby, this result should be interpreted as describing the vacuum

polarization eﬀect which is induced by the external Coulomb ﬁeld. Therefore, the current

of N-electron system with adding the vacuum polarization ( here we consider the case that

the N-electrons occupy the one-particle states up to the Fermi level, as illustrated in Fig. 1

) is given as

The second line gives the vacuum polarization [8,9,13]. To include this eﬀect in our Hamil-

tonian, we have to modify the contraction scheme. From the deﬁnition of the contraction:

A•(t)B•(t′) = hF |A(t)B(t′)|F iθ(t − t′) − hF |B(t′)A(t)|F iθ(t′ − t).

(16)

Here, A(t) and B(t) are some kind of operators, and |F i is a Fermi sea. We introduce the

deﬁnition for the step function at the same time as θ(t − t′)t=t′ = θ(t′ − t)t=t′ = 1

2. Then we

obtain the following relation:

hF |T (A(t)B(t′))|F it=t′ = hF |A•(t)B•(t′)|F it=t′

hF |A(t)B(t)|F i −

=

hF |B(t)A(t)|F i.

(17)

Let us consider the fact that, it is clear from the Hamiltonian given in Eq. (3), the expecta-

tion value of it will be written in a functional of the 4-current jµ, as same as the discussion in

Ref. 8. Therefore, we introduce a hypothesis that our Hamiltonian is written by operators

in the same-time T -products, and when we factorize the vacuum expectation value for an

operator product with the aid of the Wick theorem, each contraction should be calculated

by the deﬁnition given in (17).

By using the above method, for example, the expectation value of ˆH is given by

(cid:27)

This gives the HF energy in our theory. We argue that we can generalize this method to

calculate expectation values for arbitrary products of operators. By using the Wick theorem,

we always factorize the matrix elements of an operator product into the sum of the products

of contractions, then the contraction is calculated by the deﬁnition given above. It is clear

from the above discussion that only the deﬁnition of the contraction for same-time operators

is modiﬁed.

B. HF solution

Now, to obtain the relativistic Slater determinant in the Thouless form [11], we will

obtain a relativistic exponential operator which transforms one to another representations.

We assume the following relations for the canonical transformation:

m = ei ˆS1ˆame−i ˆS1 =
ˆa′

(αmnˆan + βmnˆb†

n),

m = ei ˆS1ˆa†
ˆa′†

where ˆS†

1 = ˆS1 will be satisﬁed. Here new operators are expanded by a complete set of the

old representation. We introduce the exponential operator in the following form:

ei ˆS1 = exp

(αmnˆa†

(19)

(21)

(22)

Here we demand that the matrices formed by the paramerters αmn, βmn, β∗

mn, γ∗

mn should be

Hermitian. Then the exponential operator formally given above is unitary. It is clear that

the operator (23) will give the relations in (19)∼(22). We will write a relativistic Slater

determinant as

|Φ(α, β, β∗, γ∗)i = ei ˆS1(α,β,β∗,γ∗)|Φ0i.

Here the Slater determinant of old representation is expressed by

|Φ0i =

ˆa†
i |0i

Yi

and the Dirac vacuum is deﬁned by ˆai|0i = 0 and ˆbi|0i = 0.

By using the relativistic Slater determinant given above, we can write the expectation

value of our Hamiltonian into an expanded form, by the same way as nonrelativistic cases.

The expectation value of our Hamiltonian is given as follows:

hΦ(α, β, β∗, γ∗)| ˆH|Φ(α, β, β∗, γ∗)i = hΦ0| ˆH|Φ0i

+ihΦ0|[ ˆH, ˆS1(α, β, β∗, γ∗)]|Φ0i

hΦ0|[[ ˆH, ˆS1(α, β, β∗, γ∗)], ˆS1(α, β, β∗, γ∗)]|Φ0i

+O( ˆS3

(24)

(25)

(26)

In (26), the ﬁrst line is the HF total energy, the second line gives the ﬁrst derivatives with

respect to the parameters (α, β, β∗, γ∗), and it must be zero in the HF condition. The third

line corresponds to the second derivatives and they determine the stability of the HF state:

i2
2!

hΦ0|[[ ˆH, ˆS1(α, β, β∗, γ∗)], ˆS1(α, β, β∗, γ∗)]|Φ0i ≥ 0,

(27)

and it is equivalent to the stability of collective modes in the RPA. It is obvious fact that the

operator formalism makes possible to do these discussions in QED. We gave the evidence

in previous paper [10] that, by using our method, we can derive the TDHF equation, HF

condition and RPA equation in QED with no inconsistency. Thus we can obtain the most

stable generalized QED solution at the HF level.

III. GROUP-THEORETICAL CLASSIFICATION OF GENERALIZED QED-HF

SOLUTIONS

A. Group-theoretical classiﬁcation

In this section, we give a brief discussion of group-theoretical classiﬁcation of the gen-

eralized QED-HF solutions. We ﬁrstly introduce the density matrix like the work of Fuku-

tome [16]:

Q4×4 = −hψ(x) ¯ψ(x)i4×4.

(28)

Here ψ and ¯ψ are usual Dirac ﬁeld, and they are 4-component bispinors. Thus our density

matrix is 4×4-matrix, as denoted above. We can expand the 4×4 density matrix into the

16-dimensional complete set of γ-matrices:

Q4×4 = QSI + QV

µ γµ + QT

µνσµν + QA

µ γ5γµ + QP iγ5.

(29)

In this expansion, we take a convention that S denotes the scalar, V denotes the vector,

T denotes the 2-rank antisymmetric tensor, A denotes the axial vector and P denotes the

pseudoscalar. I is the 4 × 4 unit-matrix, γµ is usual Dirac gamma matrix, σµν is deﬁned as

σµν = i

2[γµ, γν], and γ5 = iγ0γ1γ2γ3. Thus we obtain the Lorentz structure in our density

matrix Q.

In the relativistic theory, we usually treat the Poincar´e group ( 4-translation and the

Lorentz group ), C ( charge conjugation ), P ( parity ), T ( time-reversal ). Under the

charge conjugation, ψ and ¯ψ are transformed as

ψ → C ¯ψT ,

¯ψ → −ψT C −1.

(30)

Then the density matrix is transformed as

Q = −hψ ¯ψi → −Chψ ¯ψiT C −1 = CQT C −1

= QSI − QV

µ γµ − QT

µνσµν + QA

µ γ5γµ + QP iγ5.

(31)

9

Here C ≡ iγ2γ0 is the charge conjugation matrix, and T denotes the transposition of matrix.

Under the time reversal,

ψ(t) → T ψ(−t),

¯ψ(t) → ¯ψ(−t)T,

(32)

together with the rule of taking the complex conjugate about c-numbers, we obtain

Q(t) = −hψ(t) ¯ψ(t)i → −T hψ(−t) ¯ψ(−t)i∗T = T Q(−t)∗T

= QS∗(−t)I + QV ∗

0 (−t)γ0 − QV ∗

i (−t)γi + QT ∗

0i (−t)σ0i

−QT ∗

ij (−t)σij + QA∗

0 (−t)γ5γ0 − QA∗

i (−t)γ5γi − QP ∗(−t)iγ5.

(33)

Here T ≡ iγ1γ3 and i, j = 1, 2, 3. Under the spatial inversion,

ψ(x) → γ0ψ(−x),

¯ψ(x) → ¯ψ(−x)γ0,

(34)

the density matrix is transformed as

Q(x) = −hψ(x) ¯ψ(x)i → −γ0hψ(−x) ¯ψ(−x)iγ0 = γ0Q(−x)γ0

= QS(−x)I + QV

0 (−x)γ0 − QV

i (−x)γi − QT

0i(−x)σ0i

+QT

ij(−x)σij − QA

0 (−x)γ5γ0 + QA

i (−x)γ5γi − QP (−x)iγ5.

(35)

The QED-HF solutions can be group-theoretically classiﬁed into several types as in

the case of nonrelativistic HF solutions [16]. To consider this problem, we determine the

symmetry-group of a system. In the atomic or molecular systems, the translation invariance

is broken. In the case of an atom, only O(3) rotation is remained in the Lorentz group (

In the case of a molecule, O(3) is replaced by the point group.). Under the O(3) rotational

symmetry, we expand the QS, QP , QV

0 and QA

0 by the scalar spherical harmonics, while we

expand the QV

i , QA

i and QT

µν by the vector spherical harmonics [17]. It is clear from (33)

and (35), the behavior of each type of the density matrix given in (29) under the spatial

inversion and time reversal depends not only on the structure of the γ-matrix, but also on

the angular momentum of the spherical harmonics. Let us consider the case of an atom. We

treat the group G = O(3) × P × T . Here, we introduce the subgroup of G as

10

O(3) × P × T, O(3) × P, O(3) × T,

P × T, O(3), P, T,

1.

For example, O(3) × P × T -invariant solution is given as

QS∗ = QS, QV ∗

0 = QV
0 ,

others = 0.

There is no case for O(3) × P -invariant solution. O(3) × T -invariant solution is given as

QS∗ = QS, QV ∗

0 = QV

0 , QA∗

0 = QA
0 ,

others = 0.

O(3)-invariant solution is given as

QS∗ = QS, QV ∗

0 = QV

0 , QA∗

0 = QA

0 , QP ∗ = QP ,

others = 0.

(39)

Due to the rotational symmetry, each density matrix can only have an s-wave component,

in all cases (37)∼(39). All solutions given above are for closed shell states. We may have

magnetic QED-HF solutions for systems under discussions, if time reversal symmetry is

broken ( For example, the cases of (38) and (39) ).

B. Nonrelativistic limit

To consider the nonrelativistic limit, we take the standard representation. The four

component spinor ψ is partitioned as [17]

where φ is the large component and χ is the small component. Then,

ψ = 



Therfore, at the nonrelativistic limit, the QS and QV

Under the presence of the vectorial density matrices like the QV

i and QT

µν, the O(3)

rotational symmetry will be broken. For P × T -, P -, T - and 1 (no symmetry)-invariant

solutions, simple classiﬁcation is impossible, because there are various possibilities of the

angular momentum dependences of the Q. This situation demands us futher investigation

in more detail in the future. It must be noted that we have to solve QED-HF equations

to ﬁnd which type of the density matrices ( and solutions ) will be realized. The natural

orbital analysis of a resulted solution is useful to elucidate the type and magnitude of broken

limit.

IV. POST QED-HF METHODS

The standard approach for inclusion of ﬂuctuation from the HF mean ﬁeld approximation

where ˆH (HF )

I

denotes the HF mean ﬁeld interaction potential. The remaining interaction

ˆHint is regarded as the perturbation to the HF solution in the case of the MBPT approach [6].

However, such single-reference (SR) MBPT approach often breaks down in the case of

near degenerate ground states, for which generalized QED-HF solutions exist, because of

the HF instability in (27) [11]. To consider these problems, we introduce the density matrix

which is deﬁned as

12

ij (κ) ρ+−
ρ++

ij (κ)

ij (κ) ρ−−
ρ−+

ij (κ)






where we write (α, β, β∗, γ) as (κ). Then we diagonalize the density matrix of the most

stable QED-HF solution for systems under consideration [14], we obtain the natural orbital

given by four-component bispinor η(±)

i

and mi as its occupation number. By using the

occupation number mi, we can select the active space for treatments of the near degeneracy

eﬀects [18]. Then the trial CI wavefunction for the QED-MCSCF are easily constructed.

The QED-MCSCF wavefunction is obtained like the nonrelativistic case:

|Ψ0i =

I ei ˆS1|ΦIi.
C (0)

XI

Here |ΦIi is the conﬁguration state function ( CSF ), CI is the CI coeﬃcient, and ei ˆS1 is

the orbital rotation operator given in previous section. With introducing the orthogonal

complement to (48), |ΨKi =

|ΦJ i, the variational operator of the MC function is

given as

J C (K)

J

P

where, ˆT † = ˆT and ˆS†

1 = ˆS1 will be satisﬁed. Then we can write the transformed energy as

ˆT =

XK6=0

TK{|ΨKihΨ0| + |Ψ0ihΨK|},

E = hΨ0|e−i ˆT e−i ˆS1 ˆHei ˆS1ei ˆT |Ψ0i.

(47)

(48)

(49)

(50)

This expression is, at a glance, same as the nonrelativistic case. Only the deﬁnition of

the orbital rotation operator is diﬀerent. From (50), we can formally derive the variational

condition such as the generalized Brillouin theorem in our QED theory. Therefore the multi-

reference ( MR ) MBPT approach based on QED-MCSCF may be feasible like CASPT2 [19]

for the nonrelativistic case.

B. QED-CC and MRCC methods

The coupled-cluster wave function [20∼22] can also be introduced to obtain dynamical

correlation corrections, by obeying the exponential ansatz:

13

|ΨCCi = ei ˆS|Φ0i.

Here the operator ˆS is given as

ˆS =

ˆSn = ˆS1 + ˆS2 + · · · + ˆSN + · · · .

n
X

n denotes the excitation level.

|Φ0i is the QED-HF state. In the relativistic theory, the

expansion given above can not be truncated at N-excitation level, because of the presence

of the Dirac sea. Here, the excitation operator ˆS is approximately truncated in the second

order; ˆS ∼= ˆS1 + ˆS2. Even under this approximation, ˆS2 includes the operators given as

follows:

i ˆajˆa†
ˆa†

kˆal,

i ˆajˆa†
ˆa†

k

ˆb†

i ˆajˆbkˆal,

l ,

ˆbiˆajˆbkˆal,

ˆbiˆajˆbkˆb†
l ,

ˆbiˆb†
j

ˆbkˆb†
l .

(53)

With considering that the operators ˆa†ˆa, ˆa†ˆb†, ˆbˆa, ˆbˆb† in exp(i ˆS1) form the Lie algebra,

there is no other posibility. To write the exponential form, the excitation operators have

to be bosonic operators. Thus we have to devide the one-particle function space to two;

occupied and unoccupied spaces. Quantum number i, j, k, l will satisfy some conditions

like the nonrelativistic case. These operators have to take the form which will give two

particle excitation with respect to HF state. The operators given above include redundant

operators, which will not give the excitation with operating the HF state. The Schr¨odinger

equation is given as

ˆHei ˆS|Φ0i = Eei ˆS|Φ0i.

Then the projected coupled-cluster equations are given as

(51)

(52)

(54)

(55)

(56)

If we replace |Φ0i in (51) with |Ψ0i in (48), we may have the MRCC formulation [14,23,24]:

hΦ0| ˆHei ˆS|Φ0i = E0,

hΦ0| ˆSn ˆHei ˆS|Φ0i = E0hΦ0| ˆSnei ˆS|Φ0i.

14

|ΨM RCCi = ei ˆS|Ψ0i ∼= ei( ˆS1+ ˆS2)|Ψ0i.

(57)

However, detailed formulations are rather complex because of redandancy. They will be

discussed elsewhere. A Schema of this work given in Fig. 2.

V. DISCUSSION

In this paper, we have developed our method which combines QED with many-body

techniques. We have given the QED Hamiltonian written by creation-annhilation opetrators,

and introduced the relativistic Slater determinant in the Thouless form. We have performed

the group-theoretical classiﬁcation of the density matrix. After these preparations, we have

discussed the possibilities of the MCSCF and coupled-cluster method in QED.

Now we discuss the relation between our theory and other relativistic theories.

In the context of the electronic structure of atoms, there are three eﬀects in atoms: The

electron correlation, the relativistic eﬀect and the QED eﬀect [25]. The electronic structure

of atoms is determined by the relation of these three factors. The electron correlation

depends on the electron numbers and can be treated by several many-body techniques. The

relativistic eﬀect becomes large with increasing the atomic number. The relativistic eﬀect in

neutral or almost neutral heavy elements can be treated satisfactorily by the Dirac-Coulomb-

Breit no-sea scheme [6], as discussed in introduction.

In fact, our QED Hamiltonian with neglecting positron states and adopting only the

density-density interaction taken into account, will derive the Dirac-Coulomb Hamilto-

nian [26,27] ( as illustrated in Fig. 3 ). Futher, we can have the Dirac-Coulomb-Breit

Hamiltonian with adding the Breit operator. Moreover, if the small component χ is approx-

imated by using the large component φ, and take into account the fact that χ gives small

contribution, then the Dirac equation can be reduced to the Schr¨odinger-Pauli equation [28],

for which 2-component spinor φ ( GSO ) will correctly allow for relativistic eﬀects up to

(v/c)2. These terms will be calculated by ab initio GSO program package [4,5].

15

On the other hand, the case to describe the inner core electrons of heavy elements or,

electrons of highly ionized heavy elements such as lithium-like uranium, the QED eﬀect can

not be neglected and we must take the Dirac sea into account. This eﬀect can be treated

by the perturbation theory in QED [9]. But this method can only take into account the

one-particle QED correction. Practically this method treat the system of atoms with a few

electrons. For an illminative example of the QED eﬀects, Fig. 4 shows the collision of two

uranium atoms [29]. This collision generates the pair-creations, and the QED eﬀects might

be appeared clearly. Moreover, the near orbital degeneracy eﬀects will become important in

this case, and also in clusters of these atoms or ions.

In the case of heavy atoms, as the ionicity becomes high and the electron number de-

crease, the many-body eﬀect becomes small and the QED eﬀect becomes large. Therefore

we propose that our theory should be applied to the cases where both the many-body eﬀects

and the QED eﬀects can not be neglected. Heavy elements in middle level of ionicity should

be one of the subject for our theory. The Dirac-Coulom-Breit no-sea scheme has been ap-

plied to only neutral or almost neutral atoms. The method of the QED correction works

only for the highly ionized heavy atoms. Our theory should be suitable for intermediate case

between them. The collision of two uranium atoms is also one of the interesting subject of

our theory. Recently, experiments of x-ray irradiation to cluster plasma are performed, and

verious new phenomena were studied [30]. The cluster of heavy ions under middle revel of

ionicity is now an interesting subject in this area. The importance of the relativistic and

QED eﬀects is discussed in such objects. Fig. 5 illustrate scope and limitation of these the-

ories. It is noteworthy that many interesting phenomena appear in the intermediate regime

even in the nonrelativistic case [31]. An application of the QED scheme to treat the strong

electron-electron interaction in solid state physics is also discussed in relation to spin density

wave and charge density wave states of mixed valence ( MV ) systems [32].

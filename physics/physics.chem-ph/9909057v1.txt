1 Introduction

Recently an idea was proposed [1] and proved [2-4] that the combined action of intramolecular
dynamics and environment could account for conversion of nuclear spin modiﬁcations of 13CH3F .
One may assume the same conversion mechanism for other molecules. This mechanism resides
in the following. The intramolecular Hamiltonian is nondiagonal with respect to deﬁnite total
nuclear spin I. That implies the nutations between molecular states with various I values. The
role of the environment is in the braking of nutation’s phase. Therefore the environment alone does
not initiate transitions with nuclear spin value changing, but, destructing quantum coherence, the
environment brakes the reversibility of nutations. It is remarkable that no cross-section can be
ascribed to such a conversion way, which makes pointing a classic analogy to this quantum process
rather problematic. For this reason, we name it quantum relaxation. The known phenomena of
enantiomers conversion [5], decay of neutral kaons [6], and neutrino oscillations [7] are other
examples of quantum relaxation.

Considered as quantum relaxation, the nuclear spin conversion delivers a number of interesting
problems, especially when being extended beyond the lowest approximations with respect to the

spin-mixing intramolecular Hamiltonian. This was shown in the work [8], where quantum relax-
ation of multilevel system was considered in the context of rather general approach. The price paid
for the progress, was also rather high. It consisted of speciﬁc form of intramolecular Hamiltonian
which mixed only a pare of states belonging to various spin modiﬁcations. The dissipative term
in the quantum evolution equation, was particular as well, being a modiﬁcation of BGK collision
model.

In the present work an attempt is made to overcome these limitations in the special case
of hydrogen-type molecule. The success of such an approach is stipulated by speciﬁc algebraic
properties of operators governing the evolution of nuclear spin and molecular frame. The author
states by no means the quantum relaxation being the main (or even signiﬁcant) cause for conversion
of real ortho- and para-hydrogen. We consider H2-type-molecule because of the following three
reasons:
1. due to its simplicity H2-molecule turns to be an ideal testing site for models of the inﬂuence
of the environment and for investigation of sensitivity of the conversion rate to the variety of the
models;
2. one can write the most general form for the intramolecular nuclear spin-mixing Hamiltonian
allowable for H2;
3. it is possible to account and to some extent investigate analitically higher orders of the spin-
mixing interaction in the conversion process.

In Sec.2 and Sec.3 we introduce the set of operators for, respectively, nuclear spin subsystem
In what follows (Sec.4 and below) these operators are used as building

2 Operator algebra of nuclear spin subsystem

The operators acting in the nuclear spin space of H2 molecule are expressed through the pro-
tons’ spin operators ˆI (1)
and may be considered as a basis of a 16-dimentional associative
algebra. Let us introduce and describe its elements. This algebra includes naturally the three
components of the total nuclear spin vector ˆI = ˆI (1)
. The total spin magnitude may take
two values - 0 and 1. One may introduce the operator of the nuclear spin value ˆI:

3 Operator algebra of molecular frame

It was shown in [9] that the evolution of molecular rotator could be described within the

framework of 10-dimentional space spanned by the operator set { ˆJ, ˆJ , ˆJ (+)
} which is at the
same time the Lie algebra of the real simplectic group Sp(4, R) or, speaking more precisely, of its
simply connected covering metaplectic group Mp(4, R) [10]. Here ˆJ is the molecular rotational
angular momentum; ˆJ is the angular momentum operator value, so that ( ˆJ · ˆJ ) = ˆJ ( ˆJ + 1); ˆJ (+)
and ˆJ (−)

are vector operators responsible, respectively, for transitions J 7→ J ± 1.

The last line in (3.3) has very clear physical meaning. It states that no scalar operator, which
acts only in the space of molecular rotation states, can generate transitions with ∆J 6= 0.

4 Mixing intramolecular interaction

For simplicity the model molecular dynamics we are going to consider consists of free molecular
rotation with a nuclear spin-mixing interaction imposed on. Vibrational and electron degrees of
freedom are not of interest and the vibrational state is assumed to be symmetric.

Let us specify the form of the spin-mixing Hamiltonian ˆHmix. Because of Pauli principle, ortho-
hydrogen (I = 1) can have only odd rotational rotational angular momentum values J, whereas
para-hydrogen (I = 0) must be in a rotational state with even J. There must be operators in
ˆHmix, which generate transitions between ortho- and para-states. ˆI (±)
from Sec.2 are the only
operators of such a kind. Because of (2.4), the components of these operators may be contained in
ˆHmix in the ﬁrst degree only. The mentioned correlation between I and J should not be violated
by ˆHmix. This makes ˆI (±)
be multiplied by vector operators aﬀecting the molecular rotation by
changing J by an odd number. We note that any vector operator, which changes J by 3 or more,
must inevitably contain the scalar products ( ˆJ (+)
) and should be equal to
zero in accordance with (3.3). Hence ˆJ (±)
by. One can now write the general form of the mixing Hamiltonian:

The scale factors ω±( ˆJ) in (4.1) account for J- dependence of nuclear spin-mixing and can be
speciﬁed by a microscopic model of mixing interaction. The line over the symbols stands for
complex conjugation. Taken with the rotational Hamiltonian ˆH0 = ω0 ˆJ ( ˆJ + 1), the terms (4.1)
add up to the total molecular Hamiltonian ˆH which will be used below.

5 Heisenberg operator for nuclear spin value ˆI(t)

Written in the superoperator form, the kinetic equation for the molecules’ density matrix reads

∂t ˆρ(t) = L[ˆρ(t)] ≡ L0[ˆρ(t)] +

νnLn[ˆρ(t)],

(5.1)

N

Xn=1

where two types of superoperators (Liouvillians) occur: L0[ˆρ(t)] ≡ −i[ ˆH, ˆρ(t)] is the Liouvillian of
the free Hamiltonian dynamics; Ln are the generators of ”irreversible parts” of evolution caused
by the environment. Various dissipative generators contribute additively and are speciﬁed by the
number n = 1, 2, . . . , N; νn give the rates of corresponding dissipative processes. In the present
work we are going to describe three types of dissipative Liouvillians and consider the simplest two
ones more or less comprehensively.

In the context of the simplest approach, one assumes that any collision with the environment’s
particles projects the hydrogen molecule onto pure ortho- and para-states; and this is the only
result of the collision in the considered model. Hence

L1[ˆρ] = ˆI ˆρ ˆI + (1 − ˆI)ˆρ(1 − ˆI) − ˆρ ≡ [ ˆI, [ˆρ, ˆI]]

(5.2)

5

One can easily prove that L1 causes the extinction of ortho-para-states coherence induced by the
mixing Hamiltonian.

In contrast to the ﬁrst model, the second one is formulated in terms of molecular frame
operators. It postulates that collisions with the environment’s particles cause frequent inﬁnitesimal
rotations of J (but do not aﬀect directly the nuclear spin):

L2[ˆρ] ≡ ˆJ ˆρ ˆJ −

ˆJ( ˆJ + 1)ˆρ −

ˆρ ˆJ ( ˆJ + 1)

2

(5.3)

Note that the ortho-para-states coherence means at the same time the coherence between states
with various J (due to the mentioned I − J correlation). Because of the last two terms in (5.3)
the deorientational collisions destruct the coherence.

The third dissipative model accounts for collisional transitions changing J. In every collision
one has J 7→ J ± 2. So the collisions do not initiate direct transitions between ortho- and para-
states. The corresponding Liouvillian has the form

L3[ˆρ] = [ ˆJ (−)

ij ¯q( ˆJ) exp{β(2 ˆJ − 1)}ˆρ, q( ˆJ) ˆJ (+)

ij ≡ ˆJ (±)

where ˆJ (±)
are traceless symmetric tensors; β = ¯hω0/kBT ; q( ˆJ) is a function of J.
This model is a strait analog of that one from the work [9]. The conversion induced by (5.5) will
be considered in details elsewhere.

Arming with L1 and L2, we may return to Eq.(5.1).

It is more convenient to deal with
Heisenberg observable ˆO(t) rather than with ˆρ(t). The corresponding equation of motion for ˆO(t)
reads

Of concern to us is the Heisenberg operator ˆI(t) of the nuclear spin value. The detailed analysis

shows that ˆI(t) (as well as any scalar Heisenberg operator) has the following structure:

ˆI(t) = A( ˆJ, t) + B( ˆJ, t) ˆI + C (+)( ˆJ, t)( ˆJ (+)

The coeﬃcients A( ˆJ, t), . . . , F ( ˆJ, t) are to be determined.

6 Conclusion

Fundamentally, the Heisenberg operator ˆI(t) let one evaluate any nuclear-spin-dependent mag-

nitude. For example, the expression

hI(t)i = T r ˆI(t)ˆρ

(6.1)

gives the conversion process in an initially prepared non-equilibrium state, where ˆρ is the initial
density matrix. One can easily show that (due to the I-J correlations) any relevant ˆρ must obey

isotropic density matrix is

ˆρ = ˆρ = ˆρ

ˆρ = ρ0( ˆJ) + ρ1( ˆJ) ˆI

(6.3)

where in accordance with (6.2) ρ0(J) = 0 for odd J and ρ0(J) = −ρ1(J) for even J.

The proposed model allows rather extended analitical evaluations. Numerical calculations are
still inevitable. For this one should specify the factors ω±( ˆJ) in (4.1). This is an independent
problem. There can be faced a situation of bad convergency of the Taylor expansions (5.9) for
some ω±( ˆJ). The analysis of these and related problems will be done elsewhere. As a result we
will be able to estimate the value of the model completely.

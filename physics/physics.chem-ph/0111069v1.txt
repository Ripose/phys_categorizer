Abstract

The inﬂuence of Coulomb interaction on the electron transport through molecular
wires is studied in the regime of incoherent tunneling. In the limit of strong Coulomb
repulsion, the current for spinless electrons is determined. It is shown that the
voltage proﬁle along the wire crucially inﬂuences the dependence of the current on
the wire length. Upon inclusion of the spin degree of freedom one ﬁnds a blocking
eﬀect which depends both on the interaction strength and on the population of the
wire. For ﬁnite Coulomb interaction, the temperature dependence of the blocking
is studied and it is shown that several regimes with diﬀerent blocking strength may
exist.

Key words: molecular wire, electron transfer, Coulomb interaction

1 Introduction

In the last few years, considerable progress towards an electronics based on
single molecules has been made [1]. Nanotubes [2,3], fullerenes [4,5], and or-
ganic molecules [6–9] have been contacted and current-voltage characteristics
were measured. These experimental successes are accompanied by a vast body
of theoretical studies [10] which mostly concentrate on coherent transport
through the molecules. However, relaxation processes on the molecule may
lead to incoherent transport [11–13] and some of the experimental data may
be interpreted in this sense [5,8].

Fig. 1. The molecular wire is modeled by identical wire units represented by circles
which are joined by identical molecular bridges “M”. Two contacts “C” provide the
connection to the left and right electrodes denoted by “L” and “R”, respectively.

Recently, Petrov et al. [12,13] have applied a nonlinear quantum kinetic sta-
tistical many-body approach in mean-ﬁeld approximation to incoherent trans-
port through short molecular wires in the limit of inﬁnitely strong Coulomb
interaction. Stimulated by this work, we discuss the charge transport through
a single wire in the incoherent regime. Assuming that relaxation processes
on the wire units are much faster than the time scale for tunneling between
diﬀerent units, a description in terms of rate equations for the electronic state
of the wire is then adequate.

The main focus of this paper will be on the inﬂuence of Coulomb interaction
on the electronic transport. After introducing in Section 2 a generic model for
the molecular wire and discussing the voltage proﬁle across the wire, the limit
of strong Coulomb repulsion will be considered in Section 3. This allows us to
restrict the calculation to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO)
and to neglect excitations to higher levels. In particular, this implies that
temperature is suﬃciently low so that the Coulomb interaction exceeds the
thermal energy. In Section 4 we will include the spin degree of freedom for the
electrons which had been neglected in Section 3. In this context the blocking of
spin channels due to Coulomb interaction will be discussed in detail. Finally, in
Section 5 we relax the requirement of strong Coulomb interaction and study
the diﬀerent regimes arising from the interplay between Coulomb repulsion
and thermal ﬂuctuations.

2 Model for a molecular wire

In this paper, we will focus on generic properties of incoherent charge trans-
port through a molecular wire. The model for the wire will consequently be
kept as simple as possible: a linear array of N identical wire units numbered
consecutively from left to right is joined by N − 1 identical molecular bridges
denoted by “M”. In order to apply a voltage and to pass a current through
the wire, the setup shown in Fig. 1 is used where two contacts “C” connect
the wire to the electrodes marked by “L” and “R”.

Except for Section 5, we will conﬁne the discussion to the case of strong

Fig. 2. The energies of the LUMOs of the wire units are depicted as dashed lines
at energy E above the electrochemical potential in the left electrode. An external
voltage V shifts the levels to the positions marked by the full lines. The energy
diﬀerences ∆EL, ∆EM, and ∆ER are deﬁned in Eqs. (2)–(4). ηL, ηM, and ηR denote
the fractions of the total applied voltage which drop across the left contact, the
wire, and the right contact, respectively.

Coulomb interaction. This prevents the wire from being charged with more
than one electron. Neglecting spin for the moment, the wire will then always
be found in one of N + 1 states: either the wire is in its ground state and all
wire units are neutral, or exactly one of the units is charged by an additional
electron. We will denote these states by “0” for a neutral wire or the number
of the unit i = 1, . . . , N which carries an extra charge.

Since we are interested in the current across the molecule beyond linear re-
sponse, we also need to specify the voltage drop along the wire. In princi-
ple, this requires the solution of the coupled Schr¨odinger and Poisson equa-
tions of the electrode-molecule-electrode system [14], which in itself presents
a formidable task that we will not try to tackle. Instead, we will use the sim-
ple model proposed in Refs. [7,15], which views the two electrodes as parallel
plates forming a capacitor with the molecule in between acting like a dielectric.

Within this picture one obtains a potential proﬁle where the applied voltage
V drops partially by ηLV and ηRV at the left and right contact, respectively,
and decreases linearly by ηMV along the wire. The condition ηL + ηM + ηR = 1
ensures that we have accounted for the full voltage drop. This situation is
shown in Fig. 2 where we have ﬁxed the electrochemical potential in the left
electrode at zero energy. The dashed lines at energy E indicate the position of
the LUMOs in the absence of an applied voltage. The actual levels represented
by the full lines at energies

Particularly at very low temperatures the current depends strongly on the
energy diﬀerences (2)–(4). If one of these energy diﬀerences is negative, the
absence of thermally activated processes will lead to a suppression of the
current. This situation is depicted in Fig. 2 where ∆EL < 0. If, on the other
hand, the energy levels of the molecular sites lie between the electrochemical
potentials in the two electrodes, a current may ﬂow even at zero temperature.
Apart from Section 5, we will always have the latter situation in mind when
discussing zero temperature results.

In the following, the electrochemical potential −eV in the right electrode is
assumed to lie lower in energy, thereby favoring transport from left to right,
which we will denote as forward direction. Furthermore, we specialize the
voltage proﬁle to the two limiting cases depicted in Fig. 3. Within model A
the voltage is constant along the molecule and drops by equal amounts at the
two contacts (ηL = ηR = 1/2, ηM = 0). In contrast, in model B the entire
voltage drops linearly along the molecule (ηL = ηR = 0, ηM = 1).

Fig. 4. Transitions between the N + 1 states of the wire occur either by tunneling
between adjacent wire units or between the end units of the wire and one of the
two electrodes.
3.1 Master equation and tunneling rates

The incoherent electron transport through an individual wire shall be de-
scribed as sequential tunneling events of an electron between the electrodes
and the end units of the wire or between adjacent wire units. The dynamics
is then modeled in terms of a Markovian master equation. Fig. 4 shows the
possible transitions between the N + 1 diﬀerent wire states. The arrows over
the corresponding tunneling rates Γ indicate the direction of transport for a
geometry depicted in Fig. 1, while the subscripts L, M, and R correspond to
the left contact, a molecular bridge, and the right contact, respectively.

In order to determine the average current through the wire, we will need the
probabilities pi(t) to ﬁnd the system in one of the states i = 0, . . . , N. Since
these constitute the only possible states, the probabilities should satisfy the
normalization condition

can be obtained. We will be particularly interested in the stationary case where
the probabilities pi become time-independent. Then, all currents (10) and (11)
will be equal, i.e.

I = IL = IR = IM,i ,

thereby ensuring current conservation.

As can be seen from Eqs. (6)–(9), the stationary probabilities pi depend only
on ratios of transition rates. We therefore introduce the “backward-forward”
ratios

The latter two relate molecular properties to contact properties and therefore
depend on the microscopic details. The ratios (13), on the other hand, combine
backward and forward rates at the same contact or bridge. In order to ensure
thermodynamic equilibrium they are given by Boltzmann factors at inverse
temperature β = 1/kBT

γM = e−β∆EM , γL = e−β∆EL , γR = e−β∆ER ,

(15)

where the energy diﬀerences have been introduced in Eqs. (2)–(4). Since all
energy diﬀerences have to sum up to the diﬀerence in electrochemical potential
between left and right electrode, i.e.

∆EL + (N − 1)∆EM + ∆ER = eV ,

the “backward-forward” ratios obey the relation

3.2 Stationary solution

In the following, we will restrict ourselves to the stationary case. Together
with the ratios (13) and (14), the master equation (6)–(9) then turns into

−(ζR + γRζL)p0 + γLζRp1 + ζLpN = 0
−(ζL + γL)p1 + p0 + γMζLp2 = 0

(19)

(21)

−(1 + γMζR)pN + γRp0 + ζRpN −1 = 0 .

Out of these N + 1 equations only N are linearly independent, so that the
normalization condition (5) is needed to determine the N + 1 stationary prob-
abilities pi.

It is convenient to start with the “molecular” part (20), which takes on the
form of a two-step recursion relation and can thus readily be solved in terms
of the two probabilities p1 and pN leading to

expressions (10) and (11) the average current (12). The resulting expression

The current changes its sign when the applied voltage is reversed and at the
same time forward and backward rates as well as left and right contacts
are interchanged. This can be veriﬁed by noting that under these changes

Further insight into the result (25)–(28) can be gained by discussing several
special cases. An important limit, which will be particularly relevant in the
discussion of the following sections, is a wire consisting only of one unit and
no bridges. Then, the current simpliﬁes to

containing forward and backward contributions. For positive energy diﬀerences
∆EL and ∆ER, the backward rates vanish at zero temperature and one is left
with the familiar result

(27)

(28)

(29)

(30)

for an sequential incoherent process with rates

ΓL and

→
ΓR.

For more than one wire unit it is instructive to compare the two models for the
voltage proﬁle introduced in Section 2. We start by considering model A where
the voltage drops only across the contacts. As a consequence, the forward and
backward rates on the molecule are equal and we have γM = 1. In this case,

I = e

,

which is consistent with Eqs. (29) and (30) for N = 1. For long wires, the
current scales like 1/N 2 with the number of wire units. Since forward and
backward tunneling rates on the wire are equal, the electron has equal proba-
bility for tunneling in forward and backward direction. The length dependence
of the current can therefore be understood in terms of a random walk where
the average time to diﬀuse across a wire of length N is proportional to N 2.

For model B, where the voltage drops entirely along the wire, the same ar-
gument holds provided the thermal energy is much larger than the energy
diﬀerence between adjacent sites, kBT ≫ ∆EM. At low temperatures, how-
ever, the situation diﬀers qualitatively since the backward rates are negligibly
small. In order to obtain a ﬁnite current even in the limit of zero temperature,
we assume that ∆EL, ∆ER > 0. At zero temperature, Eqs. 25)–(28) then yield

which reduces to (30) for N = 1. For a long wire, the current now decreases
linearly with the number of units or, equivalently, with the length of the wire.
In this sense, for model B the wire resembles an ohmic resistor.

The comparison of models A and B demonstrates that the dependence of
the current on the wire length at low temperatures may provide qualitative
information about the voltage drop across the molecule. In any case, however,
incoherent transport leads to an algebraic length dependence of the current
in clear contrast to the exponential dependence characteristic for coherent
transport [10].

4 Blocking of spin channels by strong Coulomb interaction

So far, we have ignored the spin degree of freedom of the electrons. In this
section, we will take the spin into account but, due to the strong Coulomb
interaction, there will be not more than one electron present on the wire.

Fig. 5. The situation depicted in Fig. 4 is generalized to include the electron spin.
The two rings corresponding to the two spin directions are joined via the neutral
state “0” of the molecule.

Furthermore, we will assume that the two spin directions are equivalent and
that no spin ﬂips occur.

Inclusion of the electron spin increases the number of possible wire states to
2N + 1. The wire can now either be neutral (with probability p0(t)) or there
can be an extra electron with spin up or down at site i = 1, . . . , N (with
probability p↑,i(t) and p↓,i(t), respectively). The possible transitions between
the diﬀerent states are depicted in Fig. 5. We emphasize that, like in Section 3,
all rates are to be understood as rates per spin direction. In the presence of a
magnetic ﬁeld, the two spin directions would no longer be equivalent and the
rates would have to be distinguished by a spin index.

A comparison of Figs. 4 and 5 shows that the two molecular parts are indepen-
dent of the spin direction and correspond to the molecular part in the spinless
case. The only diﬀerence lies in the coupling to the neutral state “0”. This
motivates to introduce the total probability pi(t) = p↑,i(t) + p↓,i(t) for an elec-
tron on site i irrespective of its spin. The resulting master equation including
the normalization condition is of the same form as Eqs. (5) and (6)–(9) in the
spinless case. The only diﬀerence consists in a factor of 2 by which the rates

ΓL and
ΓR describing the charging of the wire have to be multiplied. For these
rates, the spin degree of freedom leads to an additional process allowing to

case, the spin is ﬁxed and the corresponding rates

The appearance of a factor of 2 may also be understood in terms of the density
of states in the electrodes which enters the tunneling rates. For tunneling of
electrons onto the wire the number of initial states is increased by the spin
degree of freedom thereby leading to an eﬀective doubling of the density of
states. On the other hand, for tunneling into the electrodes the density of ﬁnal
states is not increased since the spin is determined by the electron leaving the
wire.

Taking into account the factor of 2 in the tunneling rates that populate the
wire, one ﬁnds for the average current

We remark, that due to the mutual blocking of the electrons one does not
obtain an overall factor of 2 in the current relative to the spinless case (25)–
(28). Instead, the current shows a more intricate inﬂuence of the spin degree
of freedom.

The mechanism of blocking is particularly transparent if the wire consists of
only one site, i.e. N = 1. We restrict ourselves to the case of zero temperature
where, as in the derivation of Eq. (30), all backward rates vanish. Then the
current (36) simpliﬁes to read

The eﬀect of blocking due to the Coulomb interaction is quantiﬁed by the
ratio of the current (40) in the presence of Coulomb repulsion and the current
(41) in the absence of interaction, i.e.

This dependence on η can be understood in terms of the average population of

ΓR, the right contact represents a bottleneck
which leads to a sizable average population of the wire and therefore to the
blocking of transport.

This result clearly shows, that inclusion of the spin degree of freedom does not
necessarily lead to a doubling of the current as would be the case in the absence
of Coulomb interaction on the wire. Apart from the interaction strength, the
average population of the wire plays a decisive role and blocking is strongest
when the right contact increases the population by acting as a bottleneck.

5 Temperature dependence of blocking

The calculation of the current-voltage characteristics presented so far was
based on the assumption that at any given time there is at most one extra
electron on the wire. Although it is straightforward to generalize the rate
equations (6)–(9) to more than one electron by extending the state space, in
general one has to solve the rate equations numerically.

Some insight into the validity of the limit of strong Coulomb interaction can
be gained by allowing a second electron on the wire. Then, an analytical
treatment is still possible if we restrict the length of the wire to one site, i.e.
N = 1. We will assume that this very site may be occupied by at most two
electrons of opposite spin. Then, there exist four diﬀerent wire states, |0i, |↑i,
|↓i, and |↑↓i, which correspond to no electron, one electron with spin up or
down, and two electrons, respectively. The energies of these four states are
schematically shown in Fig. 7 where we allow for an interaction energy U if
two electrons are present on the wire. By changing both, the temperature as
well as the one-electron energy E relative to the left electrochemical potential,
we may choose the levels which are relevant for the transport through the
wire.

The discussion in the last section has shown that the eﬀect of blocking is
most pronounced when the tunneling rates through the right contact are much
smaller than through the left one. We therefore shall concentrate on this limit.

energy between the electrons occupying the site.

0, 1, or 2 electrons depends only on the rates through the left contact. These
tunneling rates may be identiﬁed by the change of the number of electrons.
For example, Γ2→1 refers to the backward rate through the left contact with
initially two electrons on the molecule. With this notation the master equation
reads

˙p0(t) = −2Γ0→1 p0(t) + Γ1→0 p1(t)
˙p1(t) = −(Γ1→0 + Γ1→2) p1(t) + 2Γ0→1 p0(t) + 2Γ2→1 p2(t)
˙p2(t) = −2Γ2→1 p2(t) + Γ1→2 p1(t)

with the normalization condition

p0(t) + p1(t) + p2(t) = 1 .

The rates Γ0→1 and Γ2→1 are each multiplied by a factor of 2, thereby account-
ing for the two spin directions possible in these processes. The probability p1
of ﬁnding one electron of arbitrary spin on the wire implicitly contains a factor
of 2 in the same sense as was discussed after Eq. (35).

If the probabilities are calculated from the master equation (46)–(48), thereby
neglecting tunneling through the right contact, the current has to be evaluated
at that contact. We will assume that the electrochemical potential in the right
→
electrode is so low that the forward rates
ΓR through the right contact are
approximately independent of the occupation of the molecular site and that
backward rates may be neglected. Then, the stationary current is obtained as

I = e

→
ΓR(p1 + 2p2) ,

(50)

where the factor of 2 accounts for the two spin directions available when one
of two electrons is leaving the molecule.

Solving the master equation (46)–(48) in the stationary limit, we obtain from

In order to study the eﬀect of blocking, we have to compare this current with
the current I0 in the absence of Coulomb interaction. In this case Γ1→2 = Γ0→1

This result still depends on temperature and on the energy E of the one-
electron level relative to the left electrochemical potential.

The ratio I/I0 depends only on rate ratios which, as in Section 3.1, may be
expressed in terms of Boltzmann factors. For single occupation of the molecule,
we have

Figure 8 depicts this result as a function of kBT /|E| for U/|E| = 2 and 2000.
The full lines correspond to the case, where the one-electron energy lies below
the left electrochemical potential, i.e. E < 0. The dashed line refers to the
opposite case with E > 0. As a function of temperature, we can distinguish
three diﬀerent regimes.

In the limit of zero temperature, one ﬁnds for E < 0, and U > −E an inter-
action induced reduction of the current by a factor 1/2. This is the blocking
discussed already in Section 4. For E + U < 0, double occupancy is possible
even in the zero temperature limit and no blocking occurs. As can be seen
from the dashed lines in Fig. 8, blocking is also absent for E > 0. In this case,

Fig. 8. The current (51) through the wire normalized with respect to the current (52)
in the absence of Coulomb interaction is plotted as a function of the temperature
T in units of |E| for U/|E| = 2 and 2000. For each value of U/|E|, a full line and a
dashed line are shown, corresponding to E < 0 and E > 0, respectively.

the current as well as the occupation of the molecule approach zero exponen-
tially for low temperatures. In analogy to the reasoning presented in Section 4,
blocking thus becomes ineﬀective.

For U ≫ |E|, a second regime appears at intermediate temperatures |E| ≪
kBT ≪ U. For U/|E| = 2000, Fig. 8 indeed shows a clear plateau at a blocking
factor of 2/3. This can be attributed to the fact that for kBT ≫ |E| the
backward rate Γ1→0 is of the order of the forward rate Γ0→1. This reduces
the population of the molecule and therefore blocking is less eﬀective than at
lower temperatures.

The reduction by a factor 2/3 can be understood even without recourse to
Eq. (55). For equal forward and backward rates, the probabilities for an empty
wire or a wire occupied with one electron of given spin are equal, leading to
probabilities p0 = 1/3, p1 = 2/3 and p2 = 0. From Eq. (50) one therefore ﬁnds
→
I = (2/3)e
ΓR. In the absence of Coulomb interaction, double occupancy is
allowed and one ﬁnds all four possible states with equal probability leading to
→
p0 = 1/4, p1 = 1/2 and p2 = 1/4. This yields the current I0 = e
ΓR, and thus
the blocking factor reads I/I0 = 2/3.

Finally, in the high-temperature regime, where kBT ≫ |E|, U, the thermal
energy is much bigger than the interaction energy U so that the latter becomes
irrelevant. Therefore, the Coulomb interaction can no longer lead to blocking
of the electronic transport.

6 Conclusions

The inﬂuence of Coulomb interaction on incoherent electronic transport
through a molecular wire has been found to be multifaceted. In the regime of
strong Coulomb interaction, the current of spinless electrons shows an alge-
braic dependence on the wire length characteristic for incoherent transport.
It was found, however, that this length dependence varies as a function of the
voltage proﬁle across the system. At low temperatures a 1/N 2 behavior indi-
cates the absence of a voltage drop along the molecule while in the presence
of a voltage drop a 1/N behavior is expected.

Inclusion of the spin degree of freedom in the absence of Coulomb interaction
leads to an increase of the current by a factor of 2. Coulomb interaction, on
the other hand, should lead to a reduction of the current. It was found that
this blocking eﬀect not only depends on the interaction strength but also on
the average population of the wire and thus on the tunneling rates (cf. Fig. 6).

For ﬁnite Coulomb interaction, the amount of blocking also depends on tem-
perature. Between the limits of suppression of the current by a factor of 2
at zero temperature and the absence of blocking at high temperatures an
intermediate regime may exist. There, Coulomb interaction prohibits double
occupancy. Nevertheless the current is only reduced by a factor of 2/3 (cf.
Fig. 8). This is a consequence of the competition between backward and for-
ward rates, which equally populates the two one-electron levels.

As a ﬁnal remark, we mention that even though we have restricted ourselves
to electronic transport, the approach presented here is also applicable to hole
transport. Depending on the situation, holes may be the dominant charge
carriers; the results presented above may easily be adapted to this case. On
the other hand, if both, holes and electrons, contribute to the transport, an
extension similar to the one presented in Section 4, where spin is included,
becomes necessary.

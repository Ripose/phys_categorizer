ABSTRACT

We perform a generalized-ensemble simulation of a small peptide taking the inter-
actions among all atoms into account. From this simulation we obtain thermodynamic
quantities over a wide range of temperatures. In particular, we show that the folding of
a small peptide is a multi-stage process associated with two characteristic temperatures,
the collapse temperature Tθ and the folding temperature Tf . Our results give supporting
evidence for the energy landscape picture and funnel concept. These ideas were previously
developed in the context of studies of simpliﬁed protein models, and here for the ﬁrst time
checked in an all-atom Monte Carlo simulation.

It is well known that a large class of proteins fold spontaneously into globular states

of unique shape, yet the mechanism of folding has remained elusive. The folding pro-

cess may be either thermodynamically or kinetically controlled. The “thermodynamic

hypothesis” assumes that the folded state corresponds to the global minimum in free en-

ergy and is supported by the famous work of Anﬁnsen [1] and similar experiments. On

the other hand, Levinthal [2] has argued that because of the huge number of local energy

minima available to a protein, it is impossible to ﬁnd the global free energy minimum

by a random search in biological time scales (of order seconds). His argument rather

suggests that the protein folds into a unique metastable state, the kinetically most ac-

cessible structure. The complexity and importance of the problem raised a lot of interest

in the subject over the last three decades, but no complete solution is in sight to date.

However, signiﬁcant new insight was gained over the last few years from the studies of

minimal protein models. Both lattice models [3]–[15] and continuum models [16]–[22]

have been extensively studied. Common to all these models is that they capture only few,

but probably dominant interactions in real proteins. These include chain connectivity,

excluded volume, hydrophobicity as the driving force, and sequence heterogeneity. For

recent reviews on minimal protein models and their applications, see Refs. [23]–[26]. From

the numerical and analytical studies of these models a new view of the folding process

emerged. The folding kinetics is seen to be determined by an energy landscape which

for foldable proteins resembles a funnel with a free energy gradient toward the native

structure [8, 12, 13, 23, 25]. The funnel is itself rough and folding occurs by a multi-stage,

multi-pathway kinetics. A common scenario for folding may be that ﬁrst the polypeptide

chain collapses from a random coil to a compact state. This coil-to-globular transition

is characterized by the collapse transition temperature Tθ.

In the second stage, a set

of compact structures is explored. The ﬁnal stage involves a transition from one of the

many local minima in the set of compact structures to the native conformation. This ﬁnal

transition is characterized by the folding temperature Tf (≤ Tθ). It was conjectured that

the kinetic accessibility of the native conformation can be classiﬁed by the parameter [14]

i.e., the smaller σ is, the more easily a protein can fold.

If Tθ ≈ Tf (i.e., σ ≈ 0),

the second stage will be very short or not exist, and the protein will fold in an “all

or nothing” transition from the extended coil to the native conformation without any

detectable intermediates. On the other hand, for some proteins the folding process may

involve further stages. A more elaborate classiﬁcation of possible folding processes is

discussed in Ref. [23].

One can ask whether the picture outlined above is really useful to describe the folding

kinetics of real proteins, because the underlying models are gross simpliﬁcations of real

protein systems. For instance, side-chain conformational degrees of freedom that are

important for packing are neglected. The situation actually resembles a vicious circle.

The energy landscape picture and the analogy to phase transitions were developed from

studies of the highly simpliﬁed description of proteins by minimal models. However, only

if these concepts apply for proteins, it is possible to argue that the broad mechanism

of phase transitions depends solely on gross features of the energy function, not on their

details. Only in this case a law of corresponding states can be applied to explain dynamics

of real proteins from studies of the folding kinetics in minimal models.

It is therefore

desirable to check the above picture by comparison with more realistic energy functions,

namely, with all-atom simulations of a suitable protein. This is the purpose of the present

article. While there has been an attempt to study the free energy landscape of an all-atom

protein model by unfolding MD simulations [27], the present work starts from random

initial conformations and is rather concerned with obtaining characteristic temperatures

of protein folding by a Monte Carlo simulation (and thus studying the energy landscape

indirectly).

Simulations of proteins where the interactions among all atoms are taken into account

have been notoriously diﬃcult (for a recent review, see Ref. [28]). The various competing

interactions yield to a much rougher energy landscape than for minimal protein models.

(In fact, one might question whether the limitations of the current energy functions may

lead to rougher energy landscapes than the protein encounters in nature.) Simulations

based on canonical Monte Carlo or molecular dynamics techniques will at low tempera-

tures get trapped in one of the multitude of local minima separated by high energy bar-

riers. Hence, only small parts of conﬁguration space are sampled and physical quantities

3

cannot be calculated accurately. However, with the development of generalized-ensemble

techniques like multicanonical algorithms [29] and simulated tempering [30, 31], an eﬃ-

cient sampling of low-energy conﬁgurations and calculation of accurate low-temperature

thermodynamic quantities became feasible. The ﬁrst application of one of these tech-

niques to the protein folding problem can be found in Ref. [32]. Later applications of

multicanonical algorithms include the study of the coil-globular transitions of a simpliﬁed

model protein [11] and the helix-coil transitions of homo-oligomers of nonpolar amino acids

[33]. A formulation of multicanonical algorithm for the molecular dynamics method was

also developed [34, 35]. A numerical comparison of three diﬀerent generalized-ensemble

algorithms can be found in Ref. [36].

The generalized-ensemble technique we utilize in this article was ﬁrst introduced in

Refs. [37, 38] and is related to Tsallis generalized mechanics formalism [39].

In this

algorithm, conﬁgurations are updated according to the following probability weight:

w(E) =

1 +

 

β(E − E0)
nF

!

−nF

,

(2)

where E0 is an estimator for the ground-state energy, nF is the number of degrees of

freedom of the system, and β = 1/kBT is the inverse temperature with a low tempera-

ture T (and kB is the Boltzmann constant). Obviously, the new weight reduces in the
low-energy region to the canonical Boltzmann weight exp(−βE) for β(E−E0)

nF ≪ 1. On
the other hand, high-energy regions are no longer exponentially suppressed but only ac-

cording to a power law, which enhances excursions to high-energy regions. In contrast to

other generalized-ensemble techniques where the determination of weights is non-trivial,

the weight of the new ensemble is explicitly given by Eq. (2). One only needs to ﬁnd an

estimator for the ground-state energy E0 which can be done by a procedure described

in Ref. [38] and is much easier than the determination of weights for other generalized

ensembles. Since the simulation by the present algorithm samples a large range of ener-

gies, we can use the reweighting techniques [40] to construct canonical distributions and

calculate thermodynamic average of any physical quantity A over a wide temperature

range:

dx A(x) w−1(E(x)) e−βE(x)

dx w−1(E(x)) e−βE(x)

Z

where x stands for conﬁgurations.

Here, we use these novel techniques to examine the picture for the folding kinetics as

proposed from the simulations of minimal models. Limitations in available computational

time force us to restrict ourselves on the simulation of small molecules, and we have

in addition neglected explicit solvent interactions. The system of our choice is Met-

enkephalin, one of the simplest peptides, with which we are familiar from earlier work

[32, 36, 41]. Met-enkephalin has the amino-acid sequence Tyr-Gly-Gly-Phe-Met. The

potential energy function Etot (in kcal/mol) that we used is given by the sum of the

electrostatic term Ees, 12-6 Lennard-Jones term ELJ , and hydrogen-bond term Ehb for all

pairs of atoms in the peptide together with the torsion term Etors for all torsion angles:

where rij (in ˚A) is the distance between the atoms i and j, and χl is the l-th torsion an-

gle. The parameters (qi, Aij, Bij, Cij, Dij, Ul and nl) for the energy function were adopted

from ECEPP/2 [44]. The dielectric constant ǫ was set equal to 2. In ECEPP/2 bond

lengths and bond angles are ﬁxed at experimental values. We further ﬁx the peptide

bond angles ω to their common value 180◦, which leaves us with 19 torsion angles (φ, ψ,

and χ) as independent degrees of freedom (i.e., nF = 19). The computer code KONF90

[45] was used. We remark that KONF90 uses a diﬀerent convention for the implemen-

tation of the ECEPP parameters (for example, φ1 of ECEPP/2 is equal to φ1 − 180◦ of

KONF90). Therefore, our energy values are slightly diﬀerent from those of the original

implementation of ECEPP/2. The simulation was started from a completely random

5

initial conformation (Hot Start). One Monte Carlo sweep updates every torsion angle of

the peptide once.

It is known from our previous work that the ground-state conformation for Met-

enkephalin has the KONF90 energy value EGS = −12.2 kcal/mol [41]. We therefore

set E0 = −12.2 kcal/mol and T = 50 K (or, β = 10.1 [

kcal/mol ]) (and nF = 19) in
our probability weight factor in Eq. (2). The ground-state structure, exhibiting a II’-

1

type β turn, is shown in Fig. 1. It is a superposition of ball-and-stick and space-ﬁlling

representations. The latter representation was added in order to give a rough idea of the

volume of the peptide as discussed below.

All thermodynamic quantities were then calculated from a single production run of

1,000,000 MC sweeps which followed 10,000 sweeps for thermalization. At the end of every

fourth sweep we stored the energies of the conformation, the corresponding volume, and

the overlap of the conformation with the (known) ground state for further analyses. Here,

we approximate the volume of the peptide by its solvent excluded volume (in ˚A3) which is

calculated by a variant [46] of the double cubic lattice method [47]. Our deﬁnition of the

overlap, which measures how much a given conformation diﬀers from the ground state, is

given by

O(t) = 1 −

where α(t)

the side-chain angles were taken into account and the diﬀerence α(t)

Let us now present our results.

In Fig. 2a we show the “time series” of the total

potential energy Etot.

It is a random walk in potential energy space, which keeps the

6

simulation from getting trapped in a local minimum. It indeed visits the low-energy region

several times in 1,000,000 Monte Carlo sweeps. The visits are separated by excursions into

high-energy regions, which ensures de-correlation of the conﬁgurations. This can be seen

in Figs. 2b and 2c, where time series of the excluded volume and the overlap function are

displayed. The large changes in these quantities imply the large conformational changes

which happen in the course of the simulation. Since large parts of the conﬁguration

space are sampled, the use of the reweighting techniques [40] is justiﬁed to calculate

thermodynamic quantities over a wide range of temperatures by Eq. (3).

We expect the folding of proteins and peptides to occur in a multi-stage process. The

ﬁrst process is connected with a collapse of the extended coil structure into an ensemble

of compact structures. This transition should be connected with a pronounced change in

the average potential energy as a function of temperature. At the transition temperature

we therefore expect a peak in the speciﬁc heat. Both quantities are shown in Fig. 3.

We clearly observe a steep decrease in total potential energy around 300 K and the

corresponding peak in the speciﬁc heat deﬁned by

C ≡

1
N kB

d (< Etot >T )
dT

= β2 < E2

tot >T − < Etot >2
T

,

N

(12)

where N (= 5) is the number of amino-acid residues in the peptide. In Fig. 4 we display

the average values of each of the component terms of the potential energy (deﬁned in

Eqs. (5)–(8)) as a function of temperature. As one can see in the Figure, the change

in average potential energy is mainly caused by the Lennard-Jones term and therefore

is connected to a decrease of the volume occupied by the peptide. This can be seen in

Fig. 5, where we display the average volume as a function of temperature. As expected,

the volume decreases rapidly in the same temperature range as the potential energy. The

average volume is a natural measure of compactness, but the change from extended coil

structures to compact structures with decreasing temperature can also be observed in

other quantities like the average end-to-end distance < de−e >T (here, deﬁned to be the

distance between N of Tyr1 and O of Met5). In Table I, we give some of the values of

< de−e >T as a function of temperature. The results imply again that the peptide is quite

extended at high temperatures and compact at low temperatures.

If both energy and volume decrease are correlated, then the transition temperature Tθ

7

can be located both from the position where the speciﬁc heat has its maximum and from

the position of the maximum of

d < V >T
dT

≡ β2 (< V Etot >T − < V >T < Etot >T ) ,

(13)

which is also displayed in Fig. 5. The second quantity measures the steepness of the

decrease in volume in the same way as the speciﬁc heat measures the steepness of decrease

of potential energy. To quantify its value we divided our time series in 4 bins corresponding

to 250,000 sweeps each, determined the position of the maximum for both quantities in

each bin and averaged over the bins.

In this way we found a transition temperature

Tθ = 280 ± 20 K from the location of the peak in speciﬁc heat and Tθ = 310 ± 20 K

from the maximum in d < V >T /dT . Both temperatures are indeed consistent with each

other within the error bars.

The second transition which should occur at a lower temperature Tf is that from a set

of compact structures to the “native conformation” that is considered to be the ground

state of the peptide. Since these compact conformations are expected to be all of similar

volume and energy (systematic comparisons of such structures were tried in previous work

[48, 49, 50]), we do not expect to see this transition by pronounced changes in < Etot >T

or to ﬁnd another peak in the speciﬁc heat. Instead this transition should be characterized

by a rapid change in the average overlap < O >T with the ground-state conformation

(see Eq. (9)) and a corresponding maximum in

d < O >T
dT

≡ β2 (< OEtot >T − < O >T < Etot >T ) .

(14)

Both quantities are displayed in Fig. 6, and we indeed ﬁnd the expected behavior. The

change in the order parameter is clearly visible and occurs at a temperature lower than

the ﬁrst transition temperature Tθ. We again try to determine its value by searching

for the peak in d < O >T /dT in each of the 4 bins and averaging over the obtained

values.

In this way we ﬁnd a transition temperature of Tf = 230 ± 30 K. We remark

that the average overlap < O >T approaches its limiting value zero only very slowly as

the temperature increases. This is because < O >T = 0 corresponds to a completely

random distribution of dihedral angles which is energetically highly unfavorable because

of the steric hindrance of both main and side chains.

8

One characterization of the folding properties of a peptide or protein is given by the

parameter σ of Eq. (1). With our values for Tθ and Tf , we have for Met-enkephalin

σ ≈ 0.2. Here, we have taken the central values: Tθ = 295 K and Tf = 230 K. This value

of σ implies that our peptide has reasonably good folding properties according to Refs. [9]

and [14]. We remark that the characterization of Met-enkephalin as a good folder has

to be taken with care: Low-temperature simulations of the molecules with conventional

methods are still a formidable task and a low value of σ may not neccessarily indicate

easy foldability in a computer simulation.

While the collapse temperature Tθ is roughly equal to room temperature, the tran-

sition temperature Tf is well below room temperature. Consequently, contributions of

ground-state conformers are not dominant at room temperature for Met-enkephalin, as

was observed in our earlier work [32, 41]. This is due to the small size of the peptide.

However, it still can be regarded as a good model for a small protein, since it has a

unique stable structure below Tf .

It was shown in Refs. [32, 41] that Met-enkephalin

remains mainly in the vicinity of the ground state without getting trapped in any of the

local-minimum structures below Tf (≈ 230 K).

We also performed a generalized-ensemble simulation with the same statistics for a

second peptide, Leu-enkephalin (data not shown). We found: Tθ = 300 ± 30 K and

Tf = 220 ± 30 K. These transition temperatures are essentially the same as for Met-

enkephalin. Both peptides are very similar, diﬀering only in the side chains of the Met

(Leu) residue. Our results indicate that indeed the general mechanism of the transition

does not depend on these details and a law of corresponding state can be applied for

similar peptides.

Let us summarize our results. We have performed a generalized-ensemble simulation of

a small peptide taking the interactions among all atoms into account and calculated ther-

modynamic averages of physical quantities over a wide range of temperatures. We found

for this peptide two characteristic temperatures. The higher temperature is associated

with a collapse of the peptide from extended coils into more compact structures, whereas

the second one indicates the transition between an ensemble of compact structures and

a phase which is dominated by a single conformation, the ground state of the peptide.

9

Our results support pictures for the kinetics of protein folding which were developed from

the study, both numerical and analytical, of simpliﬁed protein models. It is still an open

question whether these minimal models can be used for predictions of protein conforma-

tions. However, our analyses, performed with an energy function which takes much more

of the details of a protein into account, demonstrate that these models are indeed able

to describe the general mechanism of the folding process. Hence, the study of simpliﬁed

models may in this way guide further simulations with more realistic energy functions.

The present paper aims to be a ﬁrst step in this direction.

• FIG. 1: Ground-state conformation of Met-enkephalin for KONF90 energy function.

The ﬁgure was created with Molscript [42] and Raster3D [43].

• FIG. 2: Time series of total potential energy Etot (kcal/mol) (a), volume V (˚A3)

(b), and overlap O (deﬁned by Eq. (9)) (c) as obtained by a generalized-ensemble

simulation of 1,000,000 Monte Carlo sweeps.

• FIG. 3: Average total potential energy < Etot >T and speciﬁc heat C as a function

of temperature. The dotted vertical line is added to aid the eyes in locating the peak

of speciﬁc heat. The results were obtained from a generalized-ensemble simulation

of 1,000,000 Monte Carlo sweeps.

• FIG. 4: Average potential energies as a function of temperature. The results were

obtained from a generalized-ensemble simulation of 1,000,000 Monte Carlo sweeps.

• FIG. 5: Average volume < V >T and its derivative d < V >T /dT as a function of

temperature. The dotted vertical line is added to aid the eyes in locating the peak

of the derivative of volume. The results were obtained from a generalized-ensemble

simulation of 1,000,000 Monte Carlo sweeps.

• FIG. 6: Average overlap < O >T and its derivative d < O >T /dT as a function of

temperature. The dotted vertical line is added to aid the eyes in locating the peak

of the derivative of overlap. The results were obtained from a generalized-ensemble

simulation of 1,000,000 Monte Carlo sweeps.

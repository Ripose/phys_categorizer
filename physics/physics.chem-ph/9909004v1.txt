Quasi-Chemical Theory
and
Implicit Solvent Models for Simulations

Abstract. A statistical thermodynamic development is given of a new implicit sol-
vent model that avoids the traditional system size limitations of computer simulation
of macromolecular solutions with periodic boundary conditions. This implicit solvent
model is based upon the quasi-chemical approach, distinct from the common integral
equation trunk of the theory of liquid solutions. The idea is geometrically to deﬁne
molecular-scale regions attached to the solute macromolecule of interest.
It is then
shown that the quasi-chemical approach corresponds to calculation of a partition func-
tion for an ensemble analogous to, but not the same as, the grand canonical ensemble
for the solvent in that proximal volume. The distinctions include: (a) the deﬁned prox-
imal volume — the volume of the system that is treated explicitly — resides on the
solute; (b) the solute conformational ﬂuctuations are prescribed by statistical thermo-
dynamics and the proximal volume can ﬂuctuate if the solute conformation ﬂuctuates;
and (c) the interactions of the system with more distant, extra-system solution species
are treated by approximate physical theories such as dielectric continuum theories.
The theory makes a deﬁnite connection to statistical thermodynamic properties of the
solution and fully dictates volume ﬂuctuations, which can be awkward in more ambi-
tious approaches. It is argued that with the close solvent neighbors treated explicitly
the thermodynamic results become less sensitive to the inevitable approximations in
the implicit solvent theories of the more distant interactions. The physical content
of this theory is the hypothesis that a small set of solvent molecules are decisive for
these solvation problems. A detailed derivation of the quasi-chemical theory escorts
the development of this proposal. The numerical application of the quasi-chemical
treatment to Li+ ion hydration in liquid water is used to motivate and exemplify the
quasi-chemical theory. Those results underscore the fact that the quasi-chemical ap-
proach reﬁnes the path for utilization of ion-water cluster results for the statistical
thermodynamics of solutions.

INTRODUCTION

Direct simulation of macromolecules in aqueous solutions typically requires con-
sideration of a mass of solution large compared to the mass of the macromolecular
solute. Frequently, the bulk of the solution is of secondary interest. The extrava-
gant allocation of computational resources for direct treatment of macromolecular
solutions limits the scientiﬁc problems that may be tackled. Thus, implicit solvent
models that eliminate the direct presence of the solvent in favor of an approximate
description of the solvation eﬀects have received universal and extended interest
[1–53].

These issues are speciﬁcally relevant to this workshop on electrostatic interac-
tions in solution for two reasons. First, electrostatic interactions exacerbate the
If all interactions were short-ranged,
diﬃculties of solute size mentioned above.
most practitioners would be satisﬁed with the traditional approach, adopting peri-
odic boundary conditions and empirically examining the system size dependence of
their results by performing calculations on successively larger systems. Second, the
additional computational requirements to treat genuinely chemical phenomena in
solution by in situ electronic structure calculations again limits the problems that
can be addressed.
In fact, the principal physical concepts involved in electronic
structure calculations for chemical problems in liquid water universally involve elec-
trostatic interactions of long range. The important example of metal ion chemistry
in proteins combines these points.

Although a variety of implicit solvent models have been tried by now in numer-
ous selected applications, they are still limited in fundamental aspects. A helpful
recent discussion of important limitations was given by Juﬀer and Berendsen [20].
They emphasize that implicit solvent models should be signiﬁcantly simpler than
explicit models in view of the approximations and ad hoc features that are accepted.
Solution chemistry problems that require direct treatment of electronic degrees of
freedom are one kind of problem that must be made signiﬁcantly simpler to per-
mit a broader computational attack. A striking example is the current ‘ab initio’
molecular dynamics calculations of aqueous solutions of simple ions. They do treat
electronic structure issues within simulations but have been typically limited to
total system sizes of 16 – 32 water molecules in periodic boundary conditions [54],
small systems by current standards with classical simulation models. These small
sizes do limit the conclusions that might be drawn; the structure and dynamics
of the second hydration shell of a Li+ ion in liquid water, the example discussed
below, undoubtedly requires calculation on systems larger than 32 water molecules.
Nevertheless, much can be learned from the study of such small systems, partic-
ularly when chemical eﬀects of the interactions of a solute with proximal solvent
molecules are the issues of greatest importance [55].

The idea for the developments presented here is aggressively to adopt the Juﬀer-
Berendsen suggestion that implicit solvent models must be signiﬁcantly simpler

than explicit models and apply that philosophy to the statistical thermodynamic
treatment of aqueous solutions. To that end, we acknowledge that some water
molecules play a speciﬁc, almost chemical, role in these hydration phenomena. We
then work out the theory that permits inclusion of a small number of such molecules
explicitly. The required theory is a descendent of the quasi-chemical approximations
of Guggenheim [56], Bethe [57], and Kikuchi [58]. It is a signiﬁcant simpliﬁcation
of direct simulation calculations. Roughly described, that theory organizes and
justiﬁes treatment of a handful of water molecules essentially as ligands of the
macromolecule of interest, letting the more distant solution environment be treated
by simple physical approximations such as the popular dielectric continuum models.

The plan of this presentation is ﬁrst to introduce an example, the hydration
of the Li+ ion, that permits a convenient discussion of the quasi-chemical theory.
That example illustrates the quasi-chemical pattern for the theory, exempliﬁes the
basic molecular information required to construct quasi-chemical predictions, and
oﬀers a simpliﬁed derivation based upon a thermodynamic model. Following that
we give an extended theoretical development of the quasi-chemical organization of
calculations of solvation free energies and then use those theoretical results to sug-
gest an explicit-implicit solvent model for statistical thermodynamic calculations
of solutions.

FIGURE 1. The minimum energy structure of a Li+ ion with six water molecules. The inscribed
ball identiﬁes the inner shell occupied by the four nearest water molecules. The two further water
molecules are in an outer shell. This illustrates the deﬁnition of the bonding or inner shell region.

EXAMPLE: THE LI+ ION IN WATER

The hydration of atomic ions provides a conceptually simple context in which
to consider the quasi-chemical approaches developed below. The previous study
of the hydration of ferric ion, Fe3+(aq), provides one such example [59]. Here we
motivate the formal developments of the theory by considering the hydration of
the Li+ ion in dilute aqueous solution and we will discuss the principal theoretical
structures in this context ﬁrst. We anticipate some of the discussion below by
noting that Li+(aq) proves to be a diﬃcult case in some important respects. Thus,
we expect to return to this example in later work. Indeed, the goal of the theoretical
developments initiated here is of a suﬃciently constructive nature that all pieces of
the puzzle needn’t become available at the same time!

Quasi-chemical Structure for the Hydration Free Energy

The quasi-chemical theory suggests expressing the chemical potential of the
lithium ion species, µLi+, in terms of ideal and non-ideal, or interaction, contri-
butions:

with β−1 = RT . In the last contribution, only a limited number of terms are in-
cluded in the sum. That limited number is the maximum number of water molecules
that may occur as inner hydration shell ligands. For the Li+ ion example, that lim-
ited number need not be greater than six (6). Fig. 1 shows the minimum energy
structure of the Li+ ion with six water molecules [60].

The coeﬃcients ˜Kn of Eq. (1) will be deﬁned more fully later. A virtue of this
n , the equilibrium

approach is that the natural initial approximation is ˜Kn ≈ K (0)
ratio for the reactions that form various inner shell clusters

Li+ + nH2O ⇀↽ Li+(H2O)n

(2)

without consideration of medium eﬀects, as for an ideal gas. Those coeﬃcients can
be assembled within the harmonic approximation for the cluster vibrations utilizing
standard electronic structure computational packages [61]. That idea is reinforced
by the results in Tables 1, 2, and 3, which we use to develop this example [60].

Within the quasi-chemical approximation of collective phenomena [58], the fac-
tors of solvent density that appear explicitly in Eq. (1) can be recognized as mean-
ﬁeld estimates of the inﬂuence of the solvent on the chemical potential of the
Li+(aq) ion. That form of the solvent mean ﬁeld, however, derives from speciﬁc
compositional eﬀects. For the realistic circumstances that long-ranged interactions
of the classic electrostatic type are important, the approximation ˜Kn ≈ K (0)
n should
be revised with implicit solvent theories intended to describe the inﬂuence of the

and the Mulliken charge for the Li+ ion in each complex utilizing the
B3LYP and dielectric continuum solvation approximations. Geome-
tries and ChelpG partial charges were obtained with basis 6-31++G**
for O, H, and 6-31G* for Li+. The Mulliken partial charges were ob-
tained with the smaller basis 6-31G on all atoms in order to simplify
their consideration. Dielectric radii for all atoms were taken from
Ref. [62] except RLi+ =2.0 ˚A.

more distant solution environment on the chemical potential of the Li+(aq) ion.
This hints at the strategy for the quasi-chemical approaches. Neighbors occupying
a carefully deﬁned proximal volume are treated explicitly. But more distant neigh-
bors are treated implicitly with the view that they can be satisfactorily treated
with simple theories and, in any case, those more distant eﬀects are a smaller part
of the whole.

The quantity -ln p0 of Eq. (1) gives the free energy in units β−1 required to open
this deﬁned proximal volume in the solvent in order that the construction of the
complexes of Eq. (2) can be pursued. This quantity is an object of research in the
theory of liquids [64] in its own right. For speciﬁc applications an approximate form
must be used. In the present example of the hydration of the Li+ ion, this packing
contribution is expected to be of a secondary size, provided the thermodynamic

state is not varied too broadly.

Finally, the quantity qLi+ of Eq. (1) is the canonical partition function for a single
Li+ in a volume V at temperature T [65]. The initial term of Eq. (1) is recognized
as the ideal (no interactions) contribution to µLi+. Thus, the second and third
terms there express the interactions of the Li+ ion with the solvent and we will
refer to these contributions as β∆µLi+.

As a point of reference, for the present example of the Li+ at inﬁnite dilution in
water under the normal conditions of T=298.15 K and ρW =1 g/cm3, we calculate
the quasi-chemical contributions (the last term) to Eq. (1) to be -128 kcal/mole
using RLi+=2.0˚A. The experimental values for the total ∆µLi+ are -114 kcal/mol
[66] and -125 kcal/mol [67].1 The contributions of repulsive interactions will raise
that calculated value toward the experimental whole, but it is unlikely to raise it
enough to exceed the highest of these values. Though the agreement is satisfactory,
it seems likely that the calculated result is too low, meaning that the Li+ ion is
less well bound to liquid water than the current calculation predicts. Additionally,
the clusters have been treated in the harmonic approximation in obtaining this
theoretical value [60].

A Thermodynamic Model

One physical view of the quasi-chemical approach is the following: Li+ ions in
aqueous solution can, in principal, be polled for the number n of water molecule

1) The value found in [67] was lowered by RT ln [RT/(1 atm liter/mol) ] = 1.9 kcal/mol to convert
to the standard state adopted here.

is proportional to those concentrations. Denoting the mole fraction of Li+ ions
with n water molecule ligands by xn, successive terms there can be expressed as
xn exp(−β∆µLi+) [68]. Those mole fractions, however, are not independent ther-
modynamic variables but are governed by the principles of chemical equilibrium.
In our example of Li+(aq), the quasi-chemical theory predicts the mole fractions of
Li+ ions with n water molecule ligands, as is shown in Fig. 2.

These ideas can be the basis of an unreﬁned but almost thermodynamical deriva-
tion of the pattern in Eq. (1).2 To develop this ‘derivation’, we ﬁrst make explicit

For the problem initially addressed in terms of variables NH2O and NLi+, these
relations provide a translation to express the problem in terms of an alternative set
of variables such as ˜NH2O and ˜NLi(H2O)+
. In the formal deﬁnition of the Gibbs free
energy G, for example, with these changes of variables the multiplier of ˜NLi(H2O)+
becomes (µLi+ + nµH2O). If the molecule number ˜NLi(H2O)+
could be varied inde-
pendently of other such composition variables, we would identify this multiplier as
the chemical potential conjugate to ˜NLi(H2O)+
. In contrast, for the problem initially
formally addressed in terms of variables like ˜NH2O and ˜NLi(H2O)+

then the relative concentrations, xn = ˜NLi(H2O)+

These relative concentrations are established by nontrivial conditions of equilib-

function for one molecule (or complex) of type α in volume V at temperature T. With a more
general understanding of the divisor of ρα, the form asserted for the ideal case is more generally
valid.
It is with the molecular identiﬁcation of these factors that the present derivation goes
beyond a purely thermodynamic analysis. We will return to this point below.

Within the simpliﬁed context of this derivation, this is the result that was sought.
The previous equation should be compared with Eq. (1). Note that it doesn’t
address the initial packing contribution -ln p0, or the other extra-cluster interaction
contributions incorporated into ˜Kn of Eq. (1). Furthermore, it ﬁnesses the recogni-
tion issue of deﬁning cluster structures for counting. Nevertheless, we can note that
the quasi-chemical step, Eq. (7), would arise in a pedagogical context by making
the free energy stationary with respect to variations in the progress of chemical re-
actions. Because of this variational aspect these approaches are sometimes referred
to as cluster-variation theories [58].

Variations of Hydration Free Energies

Predictions of variations of hydration free energy changes with temperature,
pressure, composition, and solute geometry are the foremost practical weaknesses
of dielectric continuum models for hydration free energies. An important facet of
this issue is that the radii parameters in the dielectric models, which are initially
established fully empirically, depend on solution thermodynamic conditions such

as temperature, pressure, and composition, and on solute conformation [69–73].
The Li+(aq) case gives direct example of this diﬃculty: the partial molar volume
of the Li+(aq) is negative, -6.4 cm3/mol [66]. The magnitude of this important
thermodynamic quantity is not explicable simply on the basis of the Born model
[66] and the sign cannot be rationalized either if any reasonable description of
excluded volume eﬀects is included. At this point, considerable further evolution of
dielectric models typically occurs with additional empirical parameters [66,74]. In
contrast, an important feature of the present approach is that explicit contributions
to the temperature and density dependences of the chemical potential are readily
available. This facilitates investigation of thermodynamic derivatives.

Pressure Variation of Hydration Free Energies

The variation of the hydration free energies with pressure is the partial molar
volume and gives direct information on hydration structure. Thus, it is particularly
valuable in learning about the hydration process. Recalling that the chemical
potential expression used in the current approach is written explicitly in Eq. (1),
the partial molar volume (∂V /∂NLi+)|β,p,NH2O is

If the initial approximation ˜Kn ≈ K (0)

derivative indicated in Eq. (12) can be evaluated explicitly. Within this approxi-

The leading factor ρH2ORT κT appropriately converts a density change to a pressure
change. The following factors assess the volume change per ligand and the number
of ligands. This interpretation doesn’t work in this speciﬁc sense if the density
dependence of the coeﬃcients in Eq. (14) is signiﬁcant. (It is interesting to note,
however, the more general interpretation given by References [76,77] to the partial
molar quantities.)

We ﬁnd n = 4.0, as demonstrated in Fig. 2 in the present example of the
Li+ at inﬁnite dilution in water under the normal conditions of T=298.15 K and
ρW =1 g/cm3. As depicted in Fig. 3, the value n = 4.0 has been corroborated by
‘ab initio’ molecular dynamics calculations [60]. Combined with the other factors,
n = 4.0 produces a contribution of -4.9 cm3/mole to the partial molar volume of
Eq. (13). The simplest idea for estimation of the non-electrostatic contributions
is to use the experimental value for the partial molar volume of He as a solute in
water, 14.8 cm3/mole [78], making the total predicted partial molar volume of Li+
vLi+=9.9 cm3/mole. Therefore, this pain-staking accounting of the eﬀects through
the ﬁrst hydration shell, detailed though it is, does not satisfactorily explain the
partial molar volume of Li+ in liquid water. Since Li+(aq) is known to have a
strongly structured second hydration shell [79–88], use of the dielectric model for
the interactions of the Li+ with the outer hydration shells is a concern and may
account for the diﬀerence between the calculated and experimental partial molar
volumes.

We note that Eq. (13) assumes that the implicit contributions to the pressure
variation are negligible. Use of the Born model directly without an empirical at-
tribution of pressure dependence to the Born radii but with the measured pressure
dependence of the solvent dielectric constant [89] contributes -0.3 cm3/mol, a neg-
ligible magnitude here. The density dependences of hydration free energies for the
auto-dissociation reaction 2H2O ⇀↽ H3O+ + OH − in water were studied some time
ago [71] from the point of view of a dielectric continuum model with the conclusion
that a non-trivial density dependence was required of the dielectric model by the
experimental data. In contrast, the formula Eq. (13) is properly insensitive to radii
parameters assigned to the solute.

Temperature Variation of Hydration Free Energies

The temperature variation of the hydration free energy is the partial molar en-
tropy and, because of its interpretation as an indicator of disorderliness, is of wide

aqueous solution. Again, the ﬁrst two terms of Eq. (1) produces the partial molar
entropy of a hard inert sphere of the right size at inﬁnite dilution [90]. We will call
that contribution s0. Diﬀerentiation of the quasi-chemical contributions in Eq. (1)
with respect to temperature at constant pressure yields the partial molar entropy:

value for the partial molar entropy of lithium ion is -25.9 cal K−1 mol−1 compared to
experimental values of -38.5 cal K−1 mol−1 [66] and -40.1 cal K−1 mol−1 [67].5 This
calculated partial molar entropy is less negative than the experimental value. Our
neglect of the outer hydration shells may explain that diﬀerence. In this context,
however, the comparison given by Friedman and Krishnan [67] of the hydration
entropies of K+ + Cl− and Ar + Ar is particularly relevant: the hydrophobic
contributions to these negative entropies of hydration can be the principal contri-
butions. Here that hydrophobic contribution has been estimated crudely using the
He results as a model.

It is striking that this careful account of the inner hydration shell structure, with
the complete neglect of eﬀects of the more distant medium and thus neglect of
dielectric properties, produces such a substantial part of the experimental partial
molar entropy. It is similarly striking that the quasi-chemical contribution to the
partial molar volume, and speciﬁcally n, is insensitive to the dielectric model uti-
lized. This suggests the hypothesis that the popular dielectric continuum models
can be satisfactory with some empiricism for the hydration free energies but such
dielectric eﬀects contribute only secondarily to variations in hydration free energies.

QUASI-CHEMICAL THEORY

This section gives a detailed derivation of the quasi-chemical pattern of calcu-
lation for statistical thermodynamics. This derivation discusses a variety of de-
tails in order to provide additional perspective on the mechanisms of the theory.
The construction of the derivation depends on two basic ingredients: the poten-
tial distribution theorem and a clustering analysis. These developments culminate
in a generalization of the thermodynamic model above and a quasi-chemical rule,
Eq. (41), that is then given a succinct direct proof.

Potential Distribution Theorem

According to the potential distribution theorem [91]

ρσ =

e−β∆U

zσ (qσ/V ) ,

D

0
E

(19)

where ρσ is the density of molecules of type σ (the ‘solute’ under consideration),
zσ = exp(βµσ) is the absolute activity of that species, qσ is the single molecule
partition function for that species, and V is the volume. The indicated average
is the usual test particle calculation: the average over the thermal motion of the
bath of the interaction potential energy between the test particle and the bath. A
virtue of this result is that the indicated average is similar to a partition function

5) The value found in [67] was adjusted by R ln[RT/(1 atm liter/mol)] = -6.4 cal K−1 mol−1 to
convert to the standard state adopted here.

but local in character. Thus all the concepts relevant to evaluation of a partition
function are relevant here too, but they typically work out more simply because of
the local character of this formulation.

The potential distribution formula, Eq. (19), can be directly generalized to treat

conformational problems: [92]

ρσ(1) = s(0)

where s(0)
σ (1) is the isolated molecule distribution function over single molecule
conformational space, including translations and rotations.6 This function is nor-
malized so that

σ (1)d1 = 1.

Z

The additional subscript on the h. . .i0,1 brackets in Eq. (20) indicate that the av-
erage is obtained for the solute in conformation 1. This generalization suggests a
notational simpliﬁcation according to which Eq. (19) can be expressed as

ρσ =

EE

Now the double brackets hh. . .ii0 indicate the average over the thermal motion of
the solute and the solvent under the conditions of no interaction between them, and
the averaged quantity is the Boltzmann factor of those interactions. The average
indicated here is the ratio of the activity of an isolated solute, ρσV /qσ, divided by
the absolute activity, zσ, of the actual solute. In the developments that follow we
will focus on the resulting feature

performing series expansions and otherwise analyzing this average.

to accomodate interactions with the solution external to the solute.

e−β∆U

where fσj is the Mayer f-(cluster)-function describing the interactions between the
σ solute and the solvent molecule j [93]. Series expansions then proceed in a direct
and simple way for this case. The clustering features of these expansions are valu-
able and we can preserve them in cases that don’t present pairwise decomposable
∆U by writing

bσj is one (1) in a geometrically deﬁned σj-bonding region and zero (0) otherwise;
bσj is an indicator function [94] or an ‘inclusion counter.’ fσj is then deﬁned by

1 =

(1 + bσj + fσj).

Yj

fσj = −bσj.

With this setup the fσj is entirely analogous to a Mayer f-function for a hard object
and can play the same role of monitoring the description of packing eﬀects in liquids.
Fig. 1 shows the natural deﬁnition of the bonding region for the application to
spherical atomic ions: bσj is one (1) inside the sphere that includes the inner shell
of water molecules whereas fσj is negative one (-1) there. Both bσj and fσj are zero
(0) outside of this bonding region.

The strategy for our derivation will be to insert this ‘resolution of 1,’ Eq. (25),
within the averaging brackets of the potential distribution theorem, then expand
and order the contributions according to the number of factors of bσj that appear.
We emphasize that physical interactions are not addressed here and that the ‘hard
sphere interactions’ appear for counting purposes only.

Low Order Contributions

Let’s note some of the properties of this expansion and the terms that result.
Consider initially the term that is zeroth order, no factors of bσj appearing. That
term is

0th order in bσj :

(1 + fσj).

Yj

This would be the interaction potential energy for the bath with a hard object that
excludes the bath from any bonding region because then fσj =-1 and the statistical
weight of Eq. (27) would be zero. Next

Now there are two bath/solvent molecules in the bonding region, that pair could
have been chosen in N(N-1)/2 ways and all other molecules excluded.

General Term

The pattern of these contributions to the cluster expansion is obvious.

If we
take the general formula for the nth order expansion term and now include the
Boltzmann factor for the full system of solute and solvent molecules, then we can
illustrate the equivalence of two diﬀerent views of the total system. In one view
the system is divided into one solute and the set of N solvent molecules compared
to an alternative view in which the solute might be a cluster. In the cluster view,
the solute is surrounded by n solvent molecules in the bonding region with the
remaining N − n solvent molecules occupying the external region. Including the
interactions, the general term takes the form

Although the expression on each side of this equation contains the full Boltzmann
factor for the complete N+1 molecule system, the ∆U on each side diﬀers. The
ﬁnal ∆U is the diﬀerence between the potential energy of the N+1 molecule sys-
tem and the energies of the separate N-n and (1+n) systems. Thus the ﬁnal ∆U
expresses the interaction energy between the separate cluster and external solvent
systems. None of the energies considered here need be pairwise decomposable.
qσWn is the canonical partition function of a cluster of n solvent molecules with the
σ (solute) molecule in a volume V at temperature T. In the Li+(aq) example, the

7) A more technical observation: In the last member of Eq. (30), n! is asserted to be the symmetry
number for the complex. This classically reﬂects the molecule exchange symmetry of the ligand
molecules. This is correct if the ligands are identical to one another and diﬀerent from the solute
that serves as a nucleus of the cluster. It is also correct if the ligands and nucleus are the same
species because of the structure of the bonding Boltzmann factors requires the cluster to be of
star type and the nucleus is thus distinguishable from the ligands on that basis. Finally, the
same formula ultimately results also if the ligands are not all of the same species. The symmetry
numbers (particle exchange symmetries) of the individual molecules aren’t involved.

It is convenient and natural to express the averaging required by the basic poten-
tial distribution formula of Eq. (20) as a product of averages for the two separate
systems. Since the Boltzmann factors for the separate systems are identiﬁed in
Eq. (30), we can do this merely by factoring the correct normalizing denominators
into the proper places:

noting that zn = Q(N − n)/Q(N) are absolute activity factors for the solvent

the product of the distributions for the bath and for the complex with n ligands in

p0 is independent of n in the thermodynamic limit for ﬁnite n. The quantity aver-
aged is zero for any solvent conﬁguration for which some solvent molecule penetrates
the deﬁned proximal volume of the solute. In the simplest examples, such as the
Li+ ion example above, this volume does not depend on solute conformation. In
general, however, p0 can depend on solute conformation. Consider, for example, an
extended solute with two or more hydrophilic sites where that the proximal volume
is deﬁned to be the union of spheres centered on each hydrophilic site. In any case,
with knowledge of p0 we can incorporate the exclusion factors of Eq. (31) into the
bath distribution and write

as intended. The systems described by this partition function, however, do not
constitute a familiar statistical thermodynamic ensemble. Instead the system is an
open microscopic volume deﬁned relative to a speciﬁc molecule of type σ. Addition-
ally, the energies involved are energy diﬀerences. The calculation identiﬁes β∆µσ
as the thermodynamic potential determined by this partition function directly.
This result is directly comparable to pedagogical depictions of Bethe-Guggenheim
approximate treatments of order-disorder theory [95].

Quasi-Chemical Approximation and Generalization

In a previous publication [68], a speciﬁc quasi-chemical approximation was iden-
tiﬁed that allowed a simpliﬁed expression of the interaction part of the solute chem-
ical potential in terms of the solvent densities, rather than activities. A general way
to achieve this result is to apply Eq. (23) to the ligand (water) species, and use the
resulting expression to eliminate the activities z in Eq. (34). If we assume that p0
is independent of conformation and that the resulting ratios of bath contributions
equal unity,8 then we obtain precisely that quasi-chemical approximation

e−β∆µσ ≈ p0

(35)

The equilibrium ratio for the aggregation reaction where n ligand (water) molecules
associate with the σ species, as in Eq. (2) with Li+ ion, evaluated without consid-
eration of the eﬀects of the more distant medium is K(0)
n . That evaluates naturally
to one (1) when n=0. This is a ﬁrst opportunity to compare the results of these
theoretical considerations with the proposed form of the solute chemical potential
in Eq. (1), where medium eﬀects on the clusters are included. In fact, the example
results of Eqs. (13) and (18) utilized this approximation.

For the problems of interest here, long-ranged external-cluster interactions should
be included, even though the assumption that p0 is independent of solute conforma-
tions can be retained a while longer. Since we are in full possession of the formally
complete quasi-chemical result, Eq. (34), we can restore the correct factors to the
approximate result in Eq. (35) by deﬁning [73]

Here the factor in the numerator still refers to cluster and external solvent interac-

a critical point and is the heart of the quasi-chemical approximations developed for critical
phenomena.

(37)

The bracketed ratio in Eq. (36) should be amenable to physical approximation
because it should be insensitive to details of intermolecular interactions at short-
range. One possible way to estimate the value of the ratio is with the common
dielectric continuum model [73]. Using this model, we notice that the factors in
the denominator are similar to contributions that will be involved in the numerator
of the ratio. The contributions that aren’t balanced in this way are of two types.
The ﬁrst of these are contributions associated with the nucleus of the cluster; but
that nucleus is typically well-buried by a coating of ligands. The second unbalanced
contribution is associated with through-solvent interferences between diﬀerent lig-
ands. Thus, the interactions that aren’t balanced in this desirable way are all of
somewhat longer range than the ones that are balanced. These arguments are of
just the type that might be presented to support the classic quasi-chemical approxi-
mation of Eq. (35). But if a physical approximation for external-cluster interactions
is available — as with the dielectric models — then the results should be insensitive
to details of the implementation, even when the quantitative contributions aren’t
negligible. In fact, this proved to be true in the lithium example. There it was
found that increasing the radius assumed for the Li+ ion from RLi+=2.0˚A to 2.65˚A
increased the predicted hydration free energy by only 1% [60].

Generalization of the Thermodynamic Derivation

The thermodynamic model developed in the previous section, culminating with
Eq. (9), can be generalized to include longer ranged correlations. This is achieved
by exploiting the potential distribution theorem, Eq. (19), through the replacement

With this replacement of the ideal solute partition function, the mass-action rela-

potential distribution theorem in Eq. (19) indicates. The equilibrium ratios Kn

j(1 + fσj)i0 in Eq. (40) eliminates close solvent contacts with the
bare solute and should be well described with the aid of dielectric continuum mod-
els. It should be compared with the p0 term of Eq. (37) that was constructed by
consideration of ‘cluster interference’ issues [68]. The diﬀerence in the structure of
this result compared to Eq. (1) is a consequence of arranging the expression so that
the actual, observed chemical equilibrium ratios Kn appear here.

in Eq. (7) but with the actual equilibrium ratios Kn utilized. This last form is
more elegant than the previous expressions for the interaction contribution to the
solute chemical potential. For simulation purposes, however, it is unlikely to be
of direct practical use because x0 will be diﬃcult to determine with statistical
precision from simulation observations. A virtue of the earlier result in Eq. (37)
was its constructive character, which emphasized how these hydration problems
could be broken down into smaller component problems that individually might be
more susceptible to approximation. Nevertheless, this quasi-chemical rule is a new,
general, and strikingly simple expression.

Of course, the x0 indicated in this quasi-chemical rule, Eq. (41), must still be
well-deﬁned, therefore the recognition problem that was central to the technical
discussion above is still essential. Nevertheless, the ﬂexibility oﬀered by the deﬁ-
nition of the bonding indicator functions, bσj, should be used in designing quasi-
chemical approximations. The quasi-chemical rule expresses the compromise that is
sought in that design. If those bonding regions are deﬁned to be large, the average
he−β∆U
j(1 + fσj)i0 should be simple because macroscopic approximations should
suﬃce. But then x0 would be correspondingly diﬃcult to determine. In contrast,
if those bonding regions are aggressively deﬁned to be small, the determination of
x0 would be simpler, but then the exclusion average becomes nearly as diﬃcult as
the original problem. A compromise should be sought that makes each of these
component problems manageable.

solvent molecule penetrates the deﬁned inner shell and zero (0) otherwise. Thus,
x0 of Eq. (43) is indeed the fraction of Li+ ions with zero inner shell neighbors.
This identiﬁcation together with the potential distribution theorem of Eq. (19)
then gives a direct derivation of the quasi-chemical rule, Eq. (41). This derivation
justiﬁes the name quasi-chemical rule because Eq. (41) is a simple, directly proved
result that permits regeneration of all the quasi-chemical approximations discussed
earlier.

Q

Though our earlier discussion noted the analogy of the ﬁrst term on the right
of Eq. (41) with the -ln p0 of Eq. (1), it is worthwhile to consider an alternative
analogy. The x0 of the quasi-chemical rule can be interpreted probabilistically.
This suggests that the information theory tools that have recently been applied
to the analysis of p0 [64,90,96–100] might be usefully applied to understanding x0
also. Nevertheless, those are physically distinct problems.

AN EXPLICIT-IMPLICIT SOLVATION MODEL

Next we drive speciﬁcally toward a simulation procedure that permits treatment
of the bulk of the solution in an implicit solvent fashion. As a beginning we note
some broad points relevant to this goal. We do not intend to eliminate all the
solvent molecules. It is clear that in many cases the solvent water molecules par-
ticipate directly and individually on a molecular basis. In the interest of physical
directness of the description, those molecules shouldn’t be eliminated. The models
we seek are then explicit-implicit hydration models. With a few important water
molecules explicitly in the calculation, we will be satisﬁed with rough theories, such
as dielectric models of the aqueous solution, for the solution more distant from the
explicit action.

Another important point is that we want to carefully limit the possibilities for
explicit water molecules. This is more than merely an economic consideration.
We want the thermal distributions of those explicit water molecules to be simple
because it is the entropic aspects of these problems that are the least clear. Untem-
pered structural ﬂuctuations would be an undesirable feature of the implicit solvent
models that we seek. The introduction of complications intended to make implicit
solvent models more realistic, such as ﬂexible external boundaries, can make more
diﬃcult the theoretical issues and the problem generally. The models we envision
will be successful to the extent that only a few explicit water molecules with sim-
ple possibilities for distribution must be treated and when rough theories will be

satisfactory for the implicit solvent portions of the system. Our ﬁnal point here is
that we want to embed these models in a theoretical structure that can be used to
analyze and test the limitations of the inevitable approximations.

The idea for how to use the quasi-chemical development of Eq. (34) as an explicit-
implicit solvation model is suggested by Fig. 4. Proximal volumes are deﬁned
around sites of the macromolecule that require speciﬁc care in treatment of neigh-
boring water molecules. Referring to the formal treatment above, this deﬁnition
implies speciﬁcation of the bonding functions biσ, and that deﬁnition does not re-
quire that the protein structure be rigidly constrained. As the theory is applied,
therefore, the protein structure can respond to speciﬁc features of the complexa-
tion. Since the volumes permitted for speciﬁc hydration are limited and sharply
deﬁned, the possibilities for problematic ﬂuctuations of the structure of the complex
are limited. Furthermore, the possibilities for a troublesome broad distribution of
ligand occupancies are also limited.

In these complicated settings, it is worthwhile to notice that the theoretical de-
velopment can be expressed in a way that is consistent with understood simulation
techniques. We consider a speciﬁc nth term of the sum of Eq. (34) and then the

This equation introduces the conformational free energy FσWn(1 + n) associated

T rn (. . .) indicates the trace as it might appear, for example, in the conventional
evaluation of a canonical partition function. That term evaluates to n! qσWn — the
‘conﬁguration integral’ [101] for the isolated cluster — in the case that the external-
cluster interactions are negligible. The formula Eq. (45) suggests a grand canonical
ensemble calculation but with some primitive and essential diﬀerences. Firstly, the
volume of the system is attached to the solute and, in fact, this volume can change
as the solute changes conformation. Secondly, the function appearing where the
potential energy would appear is the conformational free energy FσWn(1 + n). This
depends on the thermodynamic state of the solvent, that is, on z and β. When
z=0, only the n=0 term of Eq. (45) is non-zero and then Eq. (45) is trivially veriﬁed
with β∆µσ=0. Finally, the thermodynamic identiﬁcation of this partition function
is the combination on the left side of Eq. (45).

Despite these important diﬀerences, the structural similarity of Eq. (45) with
a grand canonical partition function is remarkable. Calculations that used this
approach would be built upon a model for FσWn(1 + n), which included physical
approximations for the extra-cluster contributions, and on the simulation algo-
rithms for calculations on grand canonical ensembles. Grand canonical simulation
calculations are less routine than other types of simulations and probably more
demanding when applied to condensed phases. If grand canonical simulations were
prohibative in a particular case because of a lack of facility of molecule exchange,
then these approaches might also be prohibitive because of that. Practical points
of diﬀerence might help, however. The present development is designed so that
the number of ligand molecules needn’t be great. Additionally, the conformational
changes of the solute can change the deﬁned proximal volume, changing the local
ligand binding characteristics either to squeeze out ligands or to open space for
insertion of new ligands.

Again we emphasize the idea that if the proximal volumes are deﬁned to be ag-
gressively small then the evaluation of the partition functions indicated in Eq. (45)

9) ρ/z is a standard combination of variables for reasons that Eq. (19) makes clear. It is also
common to employ the notation ζα = zαqα/V so that ρα/ζα → 1 when interactions are negligible.

In the most favorable case, the indicated partition functions
should be simpler.
might be evaluated by a maximum term and gaussian distribution procedure. In
that case, the computational work to exploit this proposal is only slightly greater
than a determination of an optimum hydration structure for the ligands. Roughly
put, the theory provides a justiﬁcation for treating a small set of waters as part
of the solute molecule under study. The theory then suggests consideration of the
‘chemical’ reaction for isolated reaction species. According to this approach, the
study of the ligands and of the complex, then inclusion of a simple implicit solvent
model permits an inference of the basic hydration free energy for the solute alone.

DISCUSSION

In the area of computational theory for aqueous solution chemistry and bio-
chemistry, there seems to be a well developed folklore that judicious inclusion of
a pivotal few water molecules is typically the important next step beyond dielec-
tric continuum implicit solvent models. The quasi-chemical approach developed
here is the statistical mechanical theory for how to do that properly for solution
thermodynamics.

Implicit Solvent Models

One goal of an implicit solvent model is to increase computational scope. Other-
wise inaccessible problems might become accessible to study. Or, perhaps, hundreds
of instances might be checked with implicit solvent models where only one instance
could be examined if suﬃcient water must be explicitly included. This increased
scope is accomplished, in concept at least, by reducing the amount of solvent that
must be explicitly tracked in a simulation calculation. The prices to be paid for this
reduction are the approximations that must be accepted and the increased com-
plexity of the implicit calculation. How the advantages and complications balance
in particular cases typically has been unclear.

Nevertheless, there are other potential advantages of implicit solvent models and
the chief of these is the same advantage oﬀered by approximate physical theories.
Scientiﬁc use of such theories serves to establish simpliﬁed concepts that are valid
and valuable where the goal is understanding as well as predicting. The physi-
cal idea implicit in the developments above is that a handful of proximal water
molecules are decisive for chemistry and biochemistry in aqueous solution. Even
for such extended molecular events as protein folding, it is a valuable hypothesis
that a small number of water molecules, perhaps hundreds rather than a hundred
times that, play a decisive role.

The quasi-chemical factors of ρH2O

n of Eqs. (1) and (35) are the most basic fea-
ture of the environment mean-ﬁeld operating on the solvent molecules included
explicitly. This identiﬁcation is a basic diﬀerence from other implicit solvent mod-

els and suggests the possibility of aggressively pushing the numbers of explicitly
included solvent molecules down to minimal chemically reasonable values.

Dielectric Models and Electronic Structure Calculations for
Solution Thermodynamics

Explicit treatment of water molecules that are near-neighbors of the solutes
should mitigate [102] the awkward, not always well-deﬁned invocations of “dielec-
tric saturation and electrostriction.” In this way, quasi-chemical developments also
address lingering foundational problems with dielectric models in applications to
solution chemistry. Parameterization of dielectric models to describe variations of
hydration free energies with temperature, pressure, composition, and solute con-
formation [69–73] are as relevant as the foundational issues. For the quasi-chemical
models used here, some empirical parameterization is still required for the ligands
that form the exterior of the complex. In the Li+ example, this means radii pa-
rameters are required for the water molecules involved. However, the results are
insensitive to radii parameters required for the solute Li+ ion; and furthermore, as
the theoretical development emphasizes, the product of such eﬀorts is the thermo-
dynamic characteristics of the solute, not the ligands. The development above has
emphasized that much of the thermodynamic state dependence of hydration free
energies is explicitly available in quasi-chemical approaches.

Similarly, phenomena involving the electronic structure of the solute are natu-
rally, though approximately, included in quasi-chemical theories. Examples of such
phenomena are nuclear versus electronic time scale issues, dispersion interactions
and electron correlation more generally, the orthogonality or ‘charge-leakage’ is-
sues that are currently discussed for dielectric models, and solute-solvent charge
transfer that was observed for the Li+ example, see Table 1. They may be ex-
cluded in unvarnished dielectric models, or included in only ad hoc ways. Since it
is the molecular and thermodynamic properties of the solute that is the goal of the
quasi-chemical theories, the phenomena listed above are reasonably included for
the solute properties.

CONCLUSIONS

This paper has given an extended development of the quasi-chemical approach to
computational solution chemistry and biochemistry and discussed the relevance of
this development to problems of implicit solvent models of the structural molecular
biology. The new implicit solvent model presented here is, more accurately, an
explicit-implicit model applicable to the statistical thermodynamics of solutions.
The physical idea for the model is that a small subset of solvent molecules are
decisive for the statistical thermodynamics and require explicit treatment, whereas
the remaining solvent molecules are less important and may be treated implicitly.

The formal derivation of the quasi-chemical formula depends on the well-known
potential distribution theorem aided by a clustering analysis that serves as a count-
ing device. In the process of the derivation, it is shown how the view of the system
is transformed from a single solute in solution to a solute complexed to solvent
ligand molecules interacting with the extra-complex solution. The thermodynamic
derivation and the quasi-chemical rule that results, Eq. (41), are new.

To illustrate the quasi-chemical approach, the hydration thermodynamic prop-
erties of Li+(aq) are calculated. The problem is framed as a series of ion hydration
reactions involving the isolated ion, water molecule ligands, and ion-ligand com-
plexes. Application of an implicit solvent model to the species, the standard dielec-
tric continuum model in this case, accounts for interactions with the extra-complex
solvent molecules. The results predict that Li+ in liquid water is surrounded by
four (4) inner shell water molecule ligands with a chemical potential comparable
to experimental results. Since the explicit pressure and temperature dependencies
of the chemical potential are analytically available in the quasi-chemical formula,
results for the partial molar volume and entropy of Li+(aq) are explicitly avail-
able. The evaluations of the partial molar volume and partial molar entropy of the
Li+(aq) give a snapshot of the status of molecular theory for these properties.

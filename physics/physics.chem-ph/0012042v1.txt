Abstract

The new interpolation model of state of binary mixture is investigated. This

model use only two parameters and produce many type of phase diagrams.

Keywords: phase transitions, binary mixture, phase diagrams.

As it is known, at present the virial equation of state is the only
theoretically substantiated form for an equation of gaseous state [1].
However, application of this equation to description of behavior of real
gases, especially within the range of high densities, presents certain
diﬃculties, since it involves a great number of terms, to be taken into
account for virial expansion. Therefore, in practice, various empirical
equations of state are often used. In elementary case the equations
include two parameters, which can be estimated by the known values
of critical magnitudes for temperature, pressure and volume. The Van
der Waals equation (see, for instance [2]) and the Redlich-Kwong equa-
tion [3] are the most applicable as the two-parametric equations. The
Redlich-Kwong model was further extended in papers of G.M.Wilson,
G.Soave and others [4]–[7], where the authors proposed to add a cer-
tain function, the so-called α-function, dependent on the characteristic
temperature. One of the main limitations in such modiﬁed models is
the presence of a great number of parameters, which cannot be rather
correctly proved.
In the case of analysis of a gaseous mixture, the
number of parameters is to be increased. Consequently, to solve this
problem, it is necessary to construct a model containing a minimum
number of parameters to be deﬁned, and , at the same time, it would
be possible to describe the behavior of a real gas’ mixture up to a liquid
state within the whole range of changes in pressure and temperature

by means of the model. Within the framework of the model presented
below, the equation of state for a binary gas mixture is treated, where
together with two the Van der Waals parameters of components the
only additional parameter of interaction is introduced. Meanwhile,
as it is shown below, even within the framework of a such simpliﬁed
statement the basic types of phase equilibria can be examined and
most of phase diagrams presently known can be obtained.

As it is known, the Van der Waals free energy for a gas is deﬁned

by the formula (see, for instance, [8]):

F = N T ln

+ N f (T )

In this work we put forward the following formula of free energy for a
mixture of two gases, namely,

(2)

Here Ni and bi are the matter content and molecular ”volume” of the
i-th component, respectively; ai is the positive constant characterizing
the interaction of the i-th gaseous component. The free energy deﬁned
by (2) can be represented in the form of

F = F1 + F2 + Fint ,
where Fint = ˜A N1N2/V , whereas Fi is the free energy of the i-th
gaseous component in the presence of another component.

Further, we conﬁne ourselves to analysis of a symmetric model, i.e.
we assume that a1 = a2 = a and b1 = b2 = b. In addition, in analysis
of phase equilibria the last terms in (2) can be neglected, since it does
not contribute to the equations for pressure and chemical potentials
of diﬀerent phases.

Now we introduce the dimensionless values, according to formulas

Vr = V /Vcrit , Tr = T /Tcrit , ρi = Ni/Vr ,

where the critical values of volume and temperature are determined
by the following expressions: Vcrit = 3b, Tcrit = 8a/(27b). Then, the

When instead of gaseous component densities ρi the total density ρ
and ”concentration“ x of the ﬁrst component by formulae ρ = ρ1 + ρ1,
x = (ρ1 − ρ2)/(ρ1 + ρ2), x ∈ [−1, 1] are introduced, the expression for
the density of free energy in the above new variables takes the form:

In the presented expression the parameter α = ˜A/4 + 9/16 is responsi-
ble for the interaction energy of gaseous components. It is easily seen
that in the case with an one-component gas (x → ±1) eqn. (5) takes
the form of the Van der Waals equation (1).

From the presented expression for the free energy the formulae for
the chemical potentials of gaseous components and pressure are di-
rectly followed, namely:

By means of (5) – (7) one can construct phase diagrams with diﬀer-
ent values of parameter α. Let the pressure in a system be speciﬁed.
The equality of chemical potentials for gaseous components

µ1(ρ, x, T ) = µ2(ρ, x, T )

is in agreement with conditions of ”gas-gas“ or ”liquid-liquid“ phase
equilibria at the speciﬁed pressure P (ρ, x, T ) = P0.

liquid“ equilibria is

The equality of equilibria in the both phases, P (ρg, xg, T ) =
P (ρl, xl, T ) = P0 and the equality of chemical potentials of the binary
system components are the conditions for ”gas-liquid“ phase equilib-
rium, namely,

µ1(ρg, xg, T ) = µ1(ρl, xl, T ) , µ2(ρg, xg, T ) = µ2(ρl, xl, T ) ,

where lower indices g and l refer to gaseous and liquid phases, respec-
tively.

Discussion

The set of equations (8) and corresponding system for the ”gas-
liquid“ equilibrium are investigated both numerically and analytically.
With diﬀerent values of determinative parameters of the problem α
and P0, various types of diagrams can be obtained, such as, the so-
called cigar, pinched cigar, the diagram of eutectic type and so on. In
the case with large values of parameters α and P0, the curves of phase
equilibrium are of domal shape and they correspond to the ”liquid-
liquid“ phase equilibrium. Here, at x → ±1 that conforms to the
case with an one-component substance, Fint → 0, and the ”liquid-
liquid“ phase equilibrium is observed at T → 0. As x → 0 (with
large values α), the contribution to the free energy of an exchange
component grows fast and the phase equilibrium is observed at higher
temperature.

When the positive interaction energy Fint → 0 the phase diagrams
are represented in the form of eutectic diagrams. This is, ﬁrst of all,
associated with the behavior of free energy curves for gas and liquid
phases during changes in the interaction energy (by the analogy with
weak solutions).

In the case with negative values of α there are no ”gas-gas“ or
”liquid-liquid“ equilibrium states, that is directly followed from math-
ematical analysis of the set of equations (8), i.e. at α ≤ 0, solution of
the second equation in the system is absent.

So, by means of the present model for a mixture of nonideal gases
the authors succeeded in obtaining various types of phase equilibrium
diagrams occurred during an experiment.

Density functional methods were developed, in which the Coulomb electron-electron interaction is
split into a long- and a short-range part. In such methods, one term is calculated using traditional
density functional approximations, like the local density approximation. The present paper tries
to shed some light upon the best way to do it by comparing the accuracy of the local density
approximation with accurate results for the He atom.

I.

INTRODUCTION

In recent years, there has been a growing interest in ap-
proaches of density functional theory (DFT) [1] based on
a long-range/short-range decomposition of the Coulomb
electron-electron interaction. The idea is to use diﬀerent,
appropriate approximations for the long-range and the
short-range contributions to the exchange and/or corre-
lation energy density functionals of the Kohn-Sham (KS)
scheme [2].

Various schemes combining a (semi)local short-range
exchange energy functional approximation with an “ex-
act” long-range exchange energy expression have been
proposed (see, e.g., Refs. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), which al-
low to impose the exact Coulombic asymptotic behav-
ior 1/r of the exchange interaction. This turned out
to be important for charge transfer, van der Waals in-
teractions, etc. But opposite approaches combining a
(semi)local long-range exchange functional approxima-
tion with an “exact” (or “hybrid”) short-range exchange
have also been used (see, e.g., Refs. 9, 10, 11, 12, 13),
which allow to introduce exact exchange in solid-state
calculations without the computationally-demanding ex-
act long-range contribution. There is also a physical
reason for doing it: long-range correlations are not well
treated by (semi)local density approximations. Treating
only the exchange exactly destroys the balance of errors,
which is important for metals, gaps, etc. Contemplating
this two opposite approaches, one can ask: is it prefer-
able to use (semi)local density functional approximations
for the long-range or for the short-range contribution to
the exchange energy?

Nozi`eres and Pines [14] have ﬁrst used the idea of de-
composing the correlation energy of the uniform elec-
tron gas into long-range and short-range contributions
to facilitate its calculation.
In the context of DFT, a
few schemes combining a (semi)local short-range density
functional approximation with a long-range correlation
energy calculated by other means have been proposed
(see, e.g., Refs. 15, 16, 17, 18, 19) to deals with for ex-

ample near-degeneracy or long-range van der Waals inter-
actions. Indeed, it is well known that (semi)local density
functional approximations are appropriate for the short-
range contribution (see, e.g., Refs. 20, 21). However, for
a given decomposition of the Coulomb interaction, there
are at least two possible deﬁnitions for a short-range cor-
relation functional. It can be deﬁned either as the diﬀer-
ence between the Coulombic correlation functional and a
long-range correlation functional associated to the long-
range part of interaction (as in Ref. 17), or directly from
the short-range part of the interaction (as in Ref. 16).
Therefore, one can wonder: what is the preferable deﬁ-
nition for a short-range correlation functional as regards
as the accuracy of (semi)local density functional approx-
imations?

This work sheds some light on these two questions.
Taking the example of the He atom, we test the accu-
racy of the local density approximation (LDA) to the
long-range and short-range contributions to the exchange
and correlation energies for a given decomposition of the
interaction. Atomic units (a.u.) are used throughout this
paper.

II. LONG-RANGE AND SHORT-RANGE
DENSITY FUNCTIONALS

We deﬁne in this section the long-range and short-
range density functionals that we consider in this work.
Let’s deﬁne ﬁrst a general exchange functional for an

arbitrary electron-electron interaction wee(r)

Ex[n; wee] = hΦ[n]| ˆWee|Φ[n]i − EH[n; wee],

(1)
where ˆWee = (1/2)
ˆn2(r1, r2)wee(r12)dr1dr2 is the
interaction operator, expressed with the pair-density
operator ˆn2(r1, r2), Φ[n]
is the KS determinant and
n(r1)n(r2)wee(r12)dr1dr2 is the
EH[n; wee] = (1/2)
Hartree functional. Likewise, the general correlation
functional associated to wee(r) writes

electron-electron interaction wcoul

ee (r) = 1/r

wcoul

ee (r) = wlr,µ

ee (r) + wsr,µ

ee (r),

(3)

where wlr,µ
ee (r) = erf(µr)/r is a long-range interaction
and wsr,µ
ee (r) = erfc(µr)/r is its short-range complement.
The parameter µ which controls the range of the de-
composition varies between 0 and ∞. For µ = 0, the
long-range interaction vanishes, wlr,µ=0
= 0, and the
short-range interaction reduces to the Coulomb interac-
tion wsr,µ=0
In the limit µ → ∞, the long-
range interaction reduces to the Coulomb interaction
wlr,µ→∞
ee , and the short-range interaction van-
ishes, wsr,µ→∞

One can also deﬁne a long-range correlation functional
associated to the interaction wlr,µ
[n] = Ec[n; wlr,µ

and a short-range correlation functional associated to the
interaction wsr,µ

cause Ec[n; wee] is not linear with respect to wee, we
do not have for the Coulombic correlation functional

III. LOCAL DENSITY APPROXIMATION

For a given electron-electron interaction, the local den-
sity approximation to the previously introduced exchange
and correlation functionals consists in locally transferring
the corresponding energy of a uniform electron gas with
the same interaction and with density equal to the local
value of the inhomogeneous density.

Let us ﬁrst consider the short-range functionals.
The short-range exchange LDA functional associated to
Esr,µ
x

[n] writes

Esr,µ

x,LDA[n] =

n(r)εsr,µ

x,unif(n(r))dr,

(13)

where εsr,µ
x,unif(n) is the exchange energy per particle of
a uniform electron gas with interaction wsr,µ
[24, 25].
Similarly, the short-range correlation LDA functional for
¯Esr,µ
c

[n] is

ee

¯Esr,µ

c,LDA[n] =

n(r)¯εsr,µ

c,unif(n(r))dr,

(14)

Z

Z

c,unif(n) = εcoul

c,unif(n) − εlr,µ
where ¯εsr,µ
c,unif(n) is obtained as the
diﬀerence of the Coulomb correlation energy, εcoul
c,unif(n),
and of the long-range correlation energy of a uniform
electron gas with interaction wlr,µ
[24, 25]. The LDA for

The LDA corresponding to the long-range function-
als are obtained by diﬀerence to the Coulombic case:
Elr,µ

IV. RESULTS FOR THE HE ATOM

We consider the simple example of the He atom. We
compare the accuracy of the LDA for the long-range or
short-range energies as follows. For each value of mu
(selected in [0, ∞[ ), we obtain an accurate value of the
energy (see Refs. 17, 27 for details), we calculate the LDA
error on the energy, and report in the plots the LDA error
(ordinate) for each accurate energy (abscissa). We choose
this way of plotting in order to emphasize the importance
of the error for a given energy value to be recovered by
the approximation: a good functional would yield small
errors even for large contributions of the energy. Further-
more, this representation gives a unique scale for both
long- and short-range expressions. The left end of the
plots corresponds to vanishing functionals (i.e., µ = 0 for

Let us consider ﬁrst the LDA errors on Esr,µ

and Elr,µ
,
represented in Fig. 1. For all values of the exchange en-
ergy (except of course at the end points), the LDA error
is systematically smaller than the error on Elr,µ
on Esr,µ
x
(the diﬀerence is of the order of 0.025 a.u. at an inter-
mediate energy of −0.5 a.u.). Using the LDA for the
short-range contribution to the exchange energy, rather
than for the long-range contribution, allows, for a given
energy, to do a smaller error on this energy, or equiv-
alently, for a given error, to treat a larger part of the
exchange energy. Note, in particular, that the LDA er-
ror on Esr,µ
becomes vanishingly small toward the left
end of the plot, corresponding to a very-short-range in-
teraction. This is in agreement with the fact that the
LDA becomes exact in the limit of a very short-range
interaction [17, 28, 29].

Fig. 2 compares the LDA errors on ¯Esr,µ

, Elr,µ
c
and ¯Elr,µ
. It clearly appears that, in the whole energy
range (except at the end points), the LDA errors on the
short-range contributions are much smaller (in absolute
value) than those on the long-range contributions. This
conﬁrms the appropriateness of the LDA for short-range
correlations, as often pointed out in the literature (see,
e.g., Refs. 17, 20, 21). Note that, contrary to the ex-
change case, the diﬀerences in the relative errors on the
long-range and short-range contributions are important.
For example, at an intermediate value of the energy of
−0.02 a.u., the LDA errors on Elr,µ
are −0.0697
a.u. and −0.0673 a.u., respectively, while the LDA er-
rors on Esr,µ
are as small as −0.0017 a.u. and
−0.0001 a.u., respectively. One sees in addition that the
LDA error on ¯Esr,µ
is always signiﬁcantly smaller (in ab-
solute value) that the error on Esr,µ
. We conclude that
the functional ¯Esr,µ
is the best suited for a local density
approximation.

Concerning the long-range/short-range decomposition
of the correlation functional according to Eq. (7) or to
Eq. (8), this work conﬁrms that the LDA is more ac-
curate for the short-range contributions. The presented
results suggest in addition that the short-range correla-
tion functional appearing in the decomposition of Eq. (7)
is better suited for the LDA that the other short-range
correlation functional appearing in the decomposition of
Eq. (8).

In the context of the long-range/short-range decom-
position in DFT, the present paper gives clues about the
part of the energy, better adapted to (local) density func-
tional approximations. We hope that it will incite to
more systematic studies of this topic.

V. CONCLUSIONS

Acknowledgments

As regards the long-range/short-range decomposition
of the exchange functional of Eq. (4), the results of this
work suggest that the LDA is more accurate for the short-
range contribution rather than for the long-range contri-
bution.

It is our pleasure to dedicate this paper to Annick
Goursot, for courageously defending DFT over the years,
building the environment which allowed us to pursue the
present work.

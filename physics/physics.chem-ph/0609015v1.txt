The inﬂuence of morphology on the optical properties of silver nanoparticles is studied. A general
relationship between the surface plasmon resonances and the morphology of each nanoparticle is
established. The optical response is investigated for cubes and decahedrons with diﬀerent trunca-
tions. We found that polyhedral nanoparticles composed with less faces show more surface plasmon
resonances than spherical-like ones. It is also observed that the vertices of the nanoparticles play an
important role in the optical response, because the sharpener they become, the greater the number
of resonances. For all the nanoparticles, a main resonance with a dipolar character was identiﬁed
as well as other secondary resonances of less intensity.
It is also found that as the nanoparticle
becomes more symmetric, the main resonance is always blue shifted.

INTRODUCTION

New synthesis methods have been developed to fab-
ricate nanoparticles (NPs) with speciﬁc size and shape
that in turn have enabled us to control optical properties
to reveal new aspects of their underlying science and to
tailor them for clearly deﬁned applications. For instance,
the optical response of nanoparticles is now being inves-
tigated for their potential in optics, magneto-optic, pho-
tonics, as a nanoengineered substrate on which the Sur-
face Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) response can
be precisely controlled and optimized, and for chemical
and biosensing applications, such as optical addressable
diagnostic methods, devices, and therapies based on the
plasmonic response of metallic NPs.1,2,3 These advances,
that allow metals to be structured and characterized on
the nanometer scale, have renewed the interest in optical
properties from physicists, chemists and materials scien-
tists to biologists.

The optical properties of metal nanoparticles (NPs)
can be tuned by controlling their size and shape. Indeed,
metallic NPs support surface plasmon resonances, which
are highly dependent on geometry and environment, pro-
viding a starting point for emerging research ﬁelds like
plasmonics.1 Surface plasmons are collective excitations
of the electrons at the interface between a conductor and
an insulator, and are described by evanescent electro-
magnetic waves which are not necessarily located at the
interface. Surface plasmon resonances (SPR) appear in
a number of diﬀerent phenomena, including the optical
response of materials at diﬀerent scales, and the Casimir
and van der Waals forces between macroscopic bodies.

Besides to the technological implications, the optical
signature of NPs can be also used as a tool of characteri-
zation. Optical techniques are non-destructive and, with
a proper implementation, they can be used to perform in
situ and in real time measurements, providing statistical
properties of the whole sample. These attributes are im-
portant because the properties of nanoparticles depend
on the environment.4,5 When growth and characteriza-
tion are made in diﬀerent ambient conditions, this can

be an additional uncontrollable variable for their inter-
pretation. Thus, optical spectroscopies can be used as
complementary tools of structural characterization tech-
niques like Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), Scanning
Tunneling Microscopy (STM), Transmission Electron Mi-
croscopy (TEM), etc., which provide the image of a small
piece of the sample, giving information about local prop-
erties and characterizing a few NPs at a time.

The interesting observation that NPs support SPR
that can be tuned by controlling their size and shape,
oﬀers a starting point for nanotechnology.4,5,6,7 In this
article, we give some insights of the SPR as a function
of the morphology for silver NPs of diﬀerent polyhedral
shapes. In the case of silver, many results indicate the
presence of icosahedra, and decahedral shapes as well
as other related morphologies like cubes and truncated
cubes.7 A very similar pattern is found in gold and cop-
per.8,9

II. FORMALISM

When a particle is under the action of an electromag-
netic (EM) ﬁeld, its electrons start to oscillate, trans-
forming energy from the incident EM wave into, for ex-
ample, thermal energy in a so-called absorption process.
The electrons can also be accelerated and then, they can
radiate energy in a so-called scattering process. The sum
of both eﬀects, absorption and scattering, is known as
the extinction of light, see Fig. 1. In this work, we con-
sider NPs, which are large enough to employ the classical
EM theory. However, they are small enough to observe
the dependence of the optical properties with its size and
shape. This means that the inhomogeneities of the par-
ticle are much smaller as compared to the wavelength
of the incident EM ﬁeld, such that, each point of the
nanoparticle can be described in terms of its macroscopic
dielectric function, which depends on the frequency only.
Here, we restrict ourselves to the elastic or coherent case,
where the frequency of the absorbed and scattered light
is the same as the frequency of the incident light.

and absorption eﬀects.

A. Discrete Dipole Approximation

2

bitrary shapes are not straight forward, and only ap-
proximations are possible. Because of the complexity of
the systems being studied here, eﬃcient computational
methods capable of treating large size systems are essen-
tial.
In the last few years, several numerical methods
have been developed to determine the optical properties
of non-spherical particles, such as the Discrete Dipole
Approximation, T-matrix, Spectral Representation, Fi-
nite Diﬀerence methods, etc.12 In this work, we employ
the Discrete Dipole Approximation.

The Discrete Dipole Approximation (DDA) is a well-
suited technique for studying scattering and absorption
of electromagnetic radiation by particles with sizes of the
order or less of the wavelength of the incident light. DDA
has been applied to a broad range of problems, including
interstellar dust grains, ice crystals in the atmosphere,
interplanetary dust, human blood cells, surface features
of semiconductors, metal nanoparticles and their aggre-
gates, and more. DDA was ﬁrst introduced by Purcell
and Pennypacker, 13 and has been subjected to several
improvements, in particular those made by Draine, and
collaborators.14,15,16 Below, we brieﬂy describe the main
characteristics of DDA and its numerical implementa-
the DDSCAT code.17 For a more complete de-
tion:
scription of DDA and DDSCAT, the reader can consult
Refs. [12–16].

DDSCAT builds up a solid object using an array of
N polarizable entities located in a periodic lattice which
resembles the shape and size of the particle under study,
see Fig. 2. These polarizable entities are located at the
positions ~ri with i = 1, 2, . . . N . DDSCAT assigns to
each entity a dipole moment given as
~pi = ←→α i · ~Ei,loc ,
(1)
where ←→α i is the dipolar polarizability of the entity at
~ri, and ~Ei,loc is the total electric ﬁeld acting on the i-th
dipole, also called the local ﬁeld. The discretization of the
particle is a good approximation when the distance d be-
tween adjacent polarizable entities is much smaller than
the wavelength λ of the incident electromagnetic ﬁeld.
Once ~ri, and ←→α i are given, and the condition d/λ ≪ 1
is fulﬁlled, it is possible to predict the light absorption
and scattering by free and embedded particles. In our
case, the silver nanoparticles of interest are suspended in
a solvent in such a way that both solvent and particles
constitute a dilute colloidal suspension.

The local ﬁeld due to an array of point dipoles under

an applied electromagnetic ﬁeld is given as

~Ei,loc = ~Ei,app + ~Ei,ind ,

(2)

where ~Ei,app is the applied ﬁeld, and ~Ei,ind is the induced
ﬁeld acting on the i-th entity due to the radiation of all
the others N − 1 dipoles that compose the nanoparticle.

When the size of a homogeneous particle is much
smaller than the wavelength of the incident light, the
NPs feel a ﬁeld spatially constant, but with a time de-
pendent phase. This is known as the quasi-static approx-
imation, which is characterized by keeping the time but
not the spatial dependence of the EM ﬁeld. The electric
ﬁeld causes the conduction electrons to oscillate coher-
ently, displacing the electron cloud from the nuclei. The
positive charges are assumed to be immobile, while the
negative charges are allowed to move under the inﬂuence
of the incident ﬁeld. The long range correlation of elec-
trons caused by Coulomb forces, and the attraction be-
tween positive and negative charges results in a restoring
force that changes the oscillation frequency of the elec-
tron cloud with respect to the positive background. In
metallic particles, the collective motion of electrons pro-
duces surface modes, whose number, position, and width
are determined by the particle shape and variations of the
dielectric function. Since the main eﬀect producing the
restoring force is the surface polarization, the proper res-
onances depend on the NP shape. For example, ellipsoids
with three diﬀerent axes have three diﬀerent oscillation
frequencies, depending on the relative length of the axes,
such that, the optical response of the NP is sensitive to
the choice of the light polarization.

For nanoparticles of less than 10 nm, radiation pro-
cesses are negligible, then the particle only absorbs en-
ergy through the excitation of surface plasmon reso-
nances.4 Altering the surface, by modifying the size,
shape, and/or environment of the conductor, the proper-
ties of SPR can be tailored. SPR of small particles can
be studied in terms of the strength of the coupling to the
applied ﬁeld of the optically active electromagnetic sur-
face modes of the system. These modes only depend on
the morphology of the particle, and not on its material
properties.10

The optical response of a NP characterized by a di-
electric function ǫ(ω), can be obtained by ﬁnding the
In 1908, Gustav
solution of the Maxwell’s equations.
Mie found the exact answer for a homogeneous spheri-
cal particle of arbitrary size.11 However, exact solutions

section Csca is deﬁned as the diﬀerence between extinc-
tion and absorption cross sections, Csca = Cext − Cabs.

DDSCAT17 creates a cubic lattice array of dipoles and
assigns to each one of they a polarizability given by the
Lattice Dispersion Relation (LDR):15

αLDR =

αCM
1 + αCM [b1 + b2ǫ + b3Sǫ] (k2/d)

,

(8)

where ǫ is the macroscopic dielectric function of the par-
ticle; S, b1, b2, and b3 are the coeﬃcients of the expan-
sion to third order in k to incorporate radiation eﬀects,
and αCM is the polarizability given by the well known
Clausius-Mossotti relation:18

ǫ − 1 =

4πnαCM
1 − 4πnαCM/3

.

(9)

Here, we have assumed that the polarizability is isotropic
and is the same for all the entities, ←→αi = αLDR. A key
factor in determining the level of accuracy that can be
reached for a given number of dipoles is the prescription
for assigning dipole polarizabilities.15 Besides the ﬁnite
wavelength, it is also important to include the inﬂuence
of the geometry of the particle has to be considered in
the dipole polarizabilities.19

It is also important to select a “realistic” dielectric
function, which better resembles the material properties
of the particle at the nanometer scale. As starting point,
we can employ dielectric functions measured experimen-
tally for bulk metals, ǫbulk(ω), and then incorporate the
main eﬀects at the appropriate scale. The experimen-
tal dielectric function has contributions due to interband
(inter) and intraband (intra) electron transitions, and as-
suming that both contributions are additive, we have

ǫbulk(ω) = ǫinter(ω) + ǫintra(ω) .

(10)

Interband contributions are due to electron transitions
from occupied to empty bulk bands separated by an en-
ergy gap. The electrons are bound for a restoring force
given by the energy diﬀerence between ground and ex-
cited electron states, usually at the ultraviolet (UV) re-
gion for metals.11 Intraband contributions come from
electron transitions at the Fermi level in incompletely
ﬁlled bands, or an otherwise when a ﬁlled band overlaps
in energy with an empty band. These transitions also
provide an absorption mechanism but at lower energies,
in metals from infrared (IR) to visible light. Electrons at
the Fermi level in metals can be excited by photons with
very small energies, such that, we say that electrons are
“free”, and their contribution to ǫbulk(ω), can be approx-
imated by the Drude model of free electrons:11

We consider silver particles with an eﬀective volume
4πa3
In all cases, the spectra
were calculated within DDA using more than 105 dipoles
to assure convergence. We employ the dielectric function
as measured on bulk silver by Johnson and Christy,22
and modiﬁed according to Eq. (12). We assume that the
NPs are immersed in a media with a refraction index
n = 1, and are well dispersed at a low concentration. In
this dilute regime the interactions between particles are
negligible,23 such that, the absorbance can be modeled
as the optical response of one immersed NP times the
concentration of particles.7

A. Cubic morphology

We study the extinction eﬃciency of cubic particles
and compare it with those obtained for diﬀerent trun-
cated cubes and the sphere. The truncated cubes are
obtained by symmetrically edging the eight vertices of
the cube by l × r, where l is the length of the cube’s side
and 0 < r ≤ 1/2. We label the diﬀerent truncations with
the number r. When r = 1/2 a cuboctahedron is ob-
tained. Six octagons and eight triangles compose all the
truncated cubes, while the cuboctahedron is composed
by six planar squares and eight triangles. All the trun-
cated cubes have fourteen faces. Finally, if we performed
a symmetric truncation of the cube with an inﬁnite num-
ber of planes, one could arrive to the sphere, as shown in
Fig. 3.

charge, m the electron mass, and 1/τ a damping constant
due to the dispersion of the electrons. At low tempera-
tures, collision times τ are determined by impurities and
imperfections in the lattice, while at room temperatures
they are dispersed by the ions of the system.

Here, we are interested in nanoparticles whose sizes
are smaller than 10 nm, such that, physical phenomena
associate with radiation eﬀects, like scattering and radi-
ation damping, are negligible, i.e., Csca ≈ 0, such that,
Cext = Cabs.4 However, we have to consider that the con-
duction electrons suﬀer an additional damping eﬀect due
to surface dispersion or ﬁnite size. In such case, we have
to make an additional adaptation to ǫbulk(ω), including
an extra damping term τ (a), which depends on the size
a of the particle. This surface dispersion is present when
the mean free path of the “free” electrons is comparable
or larger than the dimension of the particle, such that,
the electrons are scattered by the surface rather than the
ions. The smaller the particle, the more important are
the surface dispersion eﬀects. The surface dispersion not
only depend on the particle’s size, but also on its shape.20
To include surface dispersion we need modify the
free electron or intraband contributions by changing the
damping term. Assuming that the susceptibilities are
additive, we can obtain the eﬀect of the bound charges
by subtracting the free electron contribution, ǫintra(ω),
from the bulk dielectric function. The free electron or
intraband contributions are obtained using the Drude
model and the theoretical values of ωp. Then, we include
the surface dispersion by adding the extra damping term
τ (a) to the Drude model. Finally, we obtain a dielec-
tric function, which also depends on the NP’s size, and
includes the contributions of (i) the free electrons, (ii)
surface damping, and (iii) interband or bound electrons
eﬀects, and is given by

In this work, we will consider for all the cases the surface
dispersion of a sphere of radius a is given by 1/τ (a) =
vf /a,21 where vf is the Fermi velocity of the electron
cloud. We will show that surface dispersion eﬀects do
not change the location of the surface modes, but they
aﬀect the coupling of the proper modes with the applied
ﬁeld, making wider and less intense.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

To understand the inﬂuence of morphology on the
SPR, we study the extinction eﬃciency Qext, for diﬀerent
polyhedral NPs, deﬁned as the extinction cross section
per unit area A, as follows

Qext =

Cext
A

.

(13)

In Fig. 4, we show the extinction eﬃciency of a silver
nanocube. As we will show later, the structure below
335 nm is independent of the morphology of the par-
ticle, because the main absorption mechanism at those
wavelengths is the interband component. At larger wave-
lengths, the spectrum is very sensitive to the morphology
of each NP. For the cubic NP, the spectrum shows a rich
structure of peaks, contrary to the case of the sphere that

has a single resonance. These peaks are associated to the
SPR inherent to the cubic geometry. Fuchs24 found nine
SPR for the cubic geometry, where only six of them ac-
count for more than the 95 % of the spectrum, as seen
in Fig. 4. The two most intense SPRs correspond to the
dipolar and quadrupolar charge distributions, and are
located at 406 nm and 383 nm, respectively. The other
SPRs are at smaller wavelengths (< 370 nm), making
wider the spectrum. Let us remind you that the small
nanosphere shows a single peak because only a homo-
geneous arrangement of the charges is possible, giving
rise to a dipolar charge distribution. On the other hand,
small cubes have more resonances because the charges
are not longer able to arrange in a homogeneous distribu-
tion, resulting in many diﬀerent ways beside the dipolar
charge distribution, even in the long wavelength approx-
imation.24

(FWHM) of the 1/8 truncated cube is about 20 nm, while
the one for the cuboctahedron is 40 nm. This means
that the secondary resonances do not disappear but they
are hidden by the dominant resonance. For comparison,
we have included the spectrum of a silver nanosphere of
10 nm of diameter. In this case, the sphere shows a single
SPR located at 356 nm and shows a FWHM of 15 nm.
For icosahedra NPs (not shown here), we have found the
main SPR at 363 nm with a FWHM of 25 nm. We can
conclude that as the number of faces of the NP increases
the energy range of the spectrum becomes smaller, the
main resonance is blue shifted, the FWHM decreases, and
fewer resonances are observed. Therefore, by obtaining
small diﬀerences in morphology, it is possible tune SPRs
at diﬀerent wavelengths.

six surface plasmon resonances are indicated by arrows.

In Fig. 5, the extinction eﬃciencies of truncated
nanocubes with r from 1/8 to 1/2 (cuboctahedron) are
shown in solid lines. The spectra for spherical (dotted
line) and cubic (dashed line) NPs are also included for
comparison.
It is observed that even for the smallest
truncation of r = 1/8, the spectrum is very sensitive to
the morphology. The dipolar resonance is blue shifted
by about 20 nm, and now becomes the most intense res-
onance. The location of the dipolar and quadrupolar
resonances are now very close, such that, only one wide
peak is observed around 386 nm, while the structure be-
low 370 nm remains almost identical to the spectrum of
the cube. The same trend is observed for larger trun-
cations, and from Fig. 5 we ﬁnd that as the length-size
of the truncation increases: (i) the main resonance is al-
ways blue shifted, (ii) the peaks at smaller wavelength
are closer to the dominant resonance, such that, they
are hidden, and (iii) the width of the main resonance in-
creases. For instance, the full width at the half maximum

B. Decahedral morphology

Another important morphology present in metal NPs
is the decahedron or pentagonal bipyramid, which is ob-
tained by diﬀerent synthesis methods.25,26,27,28,29 It is
known that metal nanoparticles of a few nanometers in
size show diﬀerent structural motifs depending on their
size, composition and energetic conditions.8,9 The regu-
lar decahedron is composed with ten planar triangular
faces which resemble two pentagons, as seen in Fig. 6,
where three diﬀerent orientations are shown. The deca-
hedron is an asymmetric particle, such that, the optical
response depends of the orientation of the incident elec-
tromagnetic ﬁeld. In Fig. 6, we show the three diﬀerent
orientations of the regular decahedron with respect to
the incident electromagnetic ﬁeld, where in (a) the elec-
tromagnetic ﬁeld ~E, is parallel to the pentagonal motif
and ~E is along the vertices, in (b) ~E is also parallel but

is along the edges, while in (c) ~E is perpendicular to the
pentagonal motif.

to achieve this limit. In Fig. 7(b), we show the extinc-
tion eﬃciency corresponding to the three diﬀerent polar-
izations described above, but taking the non-dissipation
limit. Here, we clearly observe that the peaks become
more pronounced, as well as new peaks appear, such that,
we can distinguish the diﬀerent resonances that compose
the spectra. For instance, the optical response for the
perpendicular polarization is composed of at least two
diﬀerent SPRs at 343 and 357 nm of about the same
magnitude. For the spectra corresponding to parallel
polarized light, we ﬁnd several SPRs. In the case when
the electric ﬁeld is along the vertices of the pentagon,
as shown in Fig. 6(a), we identify at least eight diﬀerent
resonances. The ﬁrst one is at 353 nm that gives rise to
a small shoulder, as well as other resonances at 372, 437,
447, 464, 478 and 492 nm. The SPRs at 437 and 447 are
also present when the electric ﬁeld is parallel and along
the edges of the pentagons. For the case along the ver-
tices (dashed line), the main resonances are at 405 nm
and 430 nm and their intensity are very similar. While

nanoparticle and its three diﬀerent orientations to the inci-
dent electromagnetic ﬁeld. (a) parallel to the pentagon along
the vertices, (b) parallel to the pentagon along the edges, and
(c) perpendicular to the pentagon.

In Fig. 7(a), the extinction eﬃciency of the decahedral
particle for the three diﬀerent polarizations, as well as
their average (inset) are shown. The dashed and solid
lines correspond to the case of parallel polarization (a)
and (b), respectively, while the dotted line corresponds
to the perpendicular polarization (c). We ﬁnd a large
anisotropy of the extinction when the light incidence is
such that the electric ﬁeld is parallel and perpendicu-
lar to the pentagonal motif. When the electric ﬁeld is
parallel to the pentagon, the corresponding spectra are
very wide with a FWHM of 90 nm, and a maximum at
about 403 nm. On the other hand, when the electric ﬁeld
is perpendicular to the pentagon, the spectrum shows a
maximum at about 343 nm, is about three times less
intense, and has a FWHM of 45 nm. The spectra for
both parallel polarizations are almost identical, except
near the maxima, where small diﬀerences are observed.
These diﬀerences would be discussed below. On the other
hand, the maxima of the average spectrum is at 410 nm,
and the FWHM is about 90 nm. In conclusion, we ﬁnd
that the parallel polarization dominates the average spec-
trum. The morphology of the decahedral NP shows sev-
eral SPRs in a wide range of wavelengths. However they
are not observed because (a) they are close of each other,
such that, the most intense hides the others and/or (b)
dissipation eﬀects make wider the resonances, and the
detailed structure is “washed out”.4

We have already mentioned that the location of the
resonant frequencies of the proper modes of the system
is not immediate, because it requires taking the non-
dissipation limit. Here, to ﬁnd the location of each one
of the SPRs for each morphology, we have considered
that the constants τ and τ (a) in Eq. (12) tend to inﬁnity

for the polarization along the edges, the main SPRs are
red shifted to 409 nm and 447 nm, respectively. The ﬁrst
one is almost twice as intense as the other. These dissim-
ilarities in location and intensity of the resonances are re-
sponsible for the small diﬀerence observed in the spectra.
However, the main diﬀerence is between light polarized

FIG. 8: Regular decahedron and its truncated morphologies,
and the sphere.

When the size of the NP is in the range of 1 nm to
5 nm, the regular decahedron is never observed. The
most common shapes are the truncated ones, the Marks
decahedron and the round decahedron. The ﬁrst struc-
ture was introduced by Marks30 and is remarkably sta-
ble and contains extra {111} facets. In very clean growth
conditions or with weak interactions with substrates, this
is one of the predominant shapes for the discussed size
interval. An alternative way to describe the Marks deca-
hedron is as a regular decahedron, which has truncations
on its facets, as shown in Fig. 8(b). When the truncation
reaches a maximum value, a morphology with the shape
of a star decahedron is formed, see Fig. 8(c). Another
type of decahedral particle, which is often observed, cor-
responds to the round pentagonal particle. An example
of these particles is shown in Fig. 8(d). This kind of
particle can be described as a truncated decahedron in
which the truncation has a minimum possible value pro-
ducing a contrast reduction in the borders. This type of
particle is frequently formed when colloidal growth meth-
ods are used.26 Here, we discuss the optical response of
the Marks decahedra with a truncation of r = 1/6, and
the maximum truncation of r = 1/2, which corresponds
to the star decahedron, and we also discuss the rounded
decahedron with a truncation of r = 1/8.

In Fig. 9, the extinction eﬃciencies of the regular
(dotted line), Marks (solid line), star (dashed line) and
rounded (dashed-dotted line) decahedral nanoparticles
for the three diﬀerent polarizations are shown. Fig. 9(a)

corresponds to the case of parallel polarization along the
vertices, and (b) to parallel polarization along the edges,
while (c) corresponds to the perpendicular one. We ob-
serve for the perpendicular polarization, Fig 9(c), that
the optical response of the regular decahedron does not
change for small truncations, in both cases, the Marks
and rounded decahedra. On the other hand, the re-
sponse of the star decahedron is totally diﬀerent since
it shows a sharp resonance at 380 nm with a FWHM

of 20 nm, while for the other morphologies the maxima
is at 343 nm, about seven times less intense, and has a
FWHM of 45 nm. For both parallel polarization cases,
all the spectra of the truncated decahedra show diﬀer-
ences to respect to the regular one. For the rounded
and Marks decahedra, the same eﬀect is observed as in
the case of truncated cubes. The main resonance is blue
shifted, and becomes the most intense resonance after
truncation, and also its FWHM decreases, as a result of
the increment of the faces. On the other hand, the star
decahedral shows the opposite behavior. In this case, the
main resonance is red shifted to around 550 nm, and the
spectra becomes very wide, since a lot of resonances are
present. Comparing the star decahedron with the cube,
we ﬁnd some similarities, such as: (i) a large number of
resonances located in a wide range of wavelengths; (ii)
the main resonance is located at the right of the spectra.
We also observe that these two morphologies present the
sharpest vertices, such that, the charge distribution at
the tips becomes very inhomogeneous, leading to extreme
ﬁeld localization.24

Recently, single-crystal polyhedral NPs with uniform
sizes have been synthesized.31 From TEM images, it was
found that these polyhedral NPs exhibit deﬁned facets
with sharp edges and corners. Tao and collaborators31 re-
ported that small silver NPs develop into cubes of 80 nm,
and as their size grows, the NPs evolve from cubes to
truncated cubes, cuboctahedra, and ﬁnally to octahe-
dra of 300 nm. The diﬀerent stages were characterized
by TEM and optical spectroscopy, where the extinction
spectra were measured. The optical spectra for cubes,
cuboctahedra and octahedra show highly complex plas-
mon signatures as a result of their geometries. For such
large NPs, the spectra show a red shift with increasing
size as a consequence of the radiation eﬀects. Taking

into account the later, the overall behavior of the optical
spectra as a function of the NPs geometry agrees well
with our theoretical results.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

The inﬂuence of morphology on the optical properties
of metal nanoparticles is studied theoretically using the
discrete dipole approximation. The location of the sur-
face plasmon resonances of silver nanoparticles of dif-
ferent polyhedral shapes was obtained. We found that
as the size truncation of the cubic nanoparticle becomes
larger, the main resonance is blue shifted, overlapping
secondary resonances, and therefore, increasing the full
width at half maximum of the main resonance. For dec-
ahedral particles, the truncation to Marks and rounded
decahedra shows the same blue shift eﬀect. However,
the full width at half maximum of the main resonance
decreases, maybe because the secondary resonances no
longer exist.
It is also found that nanoparticles with
fewer faces, like the star decahedron, show resonances
in a wider range of wavelengths, perhaps because these
geometrical shapes have sharper vertices as compared to
the others.
It is expected that this information would
be useful to motivate the development of more complex
nanostructures with tunable surface plasmon resonances.

We make systematic measurements of Raman anti-Stokes/Stokes (aS/S) ratios using two diﬀerent
laser excitations (514 and 633 nm) of rhodamine 6G (RH6G) on dried Ag colloids over a wide range
of temperatures (100 to 350 K). We show that a temperature scan allows the separation of the
contributions to the aS/S ratios from resonance eﬀects and heating/pumping, thus decoupling the
two main aspects of the problem. The temperature rise is found to be larger when employing the 633
nm laser. In addition, we ﬁnd evidence for mode speciﬁc vibrational pumping at higher laser power
densities. We analyze our results in the framework of ongoing discussion on laser heating/pumping
under SERS conditions.

INTRODUCTION

Despite rapid progress on Surface Enhanced Raman
Scattering (SERS)[1, 2] towards applications [3, 4, 5, 6],
many fundamental questions remain open. An important
issue –that has been the subject of controversy– relates to
whether the local enhanced electromagnetic (EM) ﬁelds
cause local heating and/or vibrational pumping. This is
important for reasons that range from the purely practi-
cal (damage to analytes under study) to the more funda-
mental (vibrational pumping). In certain cases, plasmon-
related heating eﬀects may even be useful[7] for biomed-
ical applications, but both the magnitude of the eﬀect
and how to control it need proper characterization. It is
possible to use the aS/S ratio under SERS conditions to
study heating/pumping eﬀects with certain limitations,
as we discuss in detail below.

The laser power dependence of the aS/S- ratio was
thought to provide strong evidence for SERS pumping
[8], but this has been the source of controversy and alter-
native explanations have been oﬀered[9, 10, 11, 12]. Con-
tributions to the aS/S-ratio can be complex and include:
heating, pumping, and resonance eﬀects. There are var-
ious hints for heating in SERS and the anomalous ratio
(commonly measured even at low powers) was predicted
to relate to hidden resonances in the system[10, 11]. We
have recently demonstrated that it is indeed possible to
use the aS/S ratio to map out roughly the underlying
resonance in certain cases[13].

Here we develop the use of aS/S-ratios further; we ex-
pand and provide additional evidence to recent discus-
sions in Refs. [12, 14]. We demonstrate how to separate
heating from resonance eﬀects through temperature (T )
dependent data. We ﬁnd a temperature rise at low laser
powers (≈ 0.5 mW on a ∼ 1.5 µm (diameter) spot) that
depends on laser energy. We ﬁnd evidence also suggest-
ing the existence of mode speciﬁc vibrational pumping at
higher laser power densities and low temperature.

II. GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS

For the sake of clarity we shall repeat the essential de-
tails of the discussion presented in Refs.[12, 14] keeping
details to a minimum. We call Tenv the temperature of
the local environment (substrate + ambient surrounding
the sample), while Troom is room temperature, Tmet the
temperature of the metal colloids, and Tmol the temper-
ature of the molecule. The main possible scenarios are:

1. No heating. The whole system is in thermal equi-

librium; i.e. Troom = Tenv = Tmet = Tmol.

2. Global heating: system in thermal equilibrium at
a T higher than Troom; i.e. Tenv = Tmet = Tmol >
Troom.

3. Local heating of substrate and analyte: when
Tmol = Tmet ≥ Tenv ≥ Troom. The analyte is in
thermal equilibrium with the metal, at a higher
temperature than their environment. The source
of heating here is mainly laser absorption in the
metal substrate.

4. Local heating of analyte Tmol ≥ Tmet ≥ Tenv ≥
Troom. Here the molecule remains in internal ther-
mal equilibrium at a temperature Tmol, higher than
the rest of the system. Strong interactions among
vibrational modes within the molecule allows vibra-
tional energy to thermalize and reach an equilib-
rium through intramolecular vibrational relaxation
or redistribution (IVR). The source of heating here
can be direct laser absorption in the molecule (via
electronic state transitions), or vibrational pump-
ing (via SERS processes) followed by fast IVR.
However, it is diﬃcult to distinguish between these
two possible causes.

5. Mode speciﬁc vibrational pumping, when the an-
alyte is not in internal thermal equilibrium. Each
vibrational mode can be described by an eﬀective
mode temperature, T ef f
, which reﬂects the popu-
lation of its ﬁrst vibrational excited state [12]. In
general, IVR ensures that T ef f
is the same for all
modes (internal thermal equilibrium at a tempera-
ture Tmol). However, SERS processes aﬀect the vi-
brational population and can pump vibrations from
the ground to the ﬁrst excited vibrational state (for
Stokes processes). If for a given vibrational mode,
the pumping rate becomes comparable or higher
than the IVR rate, this mode can then have a
higher eﬀective temperature than the other modes:
T ef f
≥ Tmol ≥ Tmet ≥ Tenv ≥ Troom; this is re-
i
ferred to as mode speciﬁc pumping.

The diﬀerent scenarios deserve a brief comment. If vi-
brational pumping occurs in the presence of fast IVR,
pumping will only be observed as an eﬀective heating of
the molecule (4th scenario). From the experimental point
of view, under these circumstances, it would be impos-
sible to distinguish this situation from the 3rd scenario.
It is indeed very diﬃcult to determine independently the
temperature of the metal and the molecule, due to the
lack of a spectroscopic feature coming explicitly from the
metal. Even if one could prove that the 4th scenario was
the correct one, it would then be extremely diﬃcult to
determine the real cause of heating: direct laser absorp-
tion or vibrational pumping, or a combination of both
eﬀects. Consequently, the only clear-cut demonstration
of vibrational pumping is, in our view, the last scenario;
i.e. mode speciﬁc pumping. Heating and pumping under
SERS conditions have previously been investigated using
peak parameter correlations, such as width or frequency
vs. intensity[12, 15]. Evidence was found for local heat-
ing (3rd or 4th scenario) but no evidence of mode speciﬁc
pumping was uncovered [12]. Although yielding evidence
for the existence of local heating, it was impossible to dis-
tinguish its origin; i.e. either within the molecule itself
or the colloid (and consequently the molecule through
its close contact with the metal). These previous results
do not exclude the presence of pumping (vide supra) but
they do not demonstrate it either.

Most other studies of heating/pumping under SERS
conditions [8, 9, 10, 11] have focused on the measure-
ments of the aS/S ratio, ρ. This ratio is in principle
directly related to the vibrational populations, and there-
fore to the eﬀective mode temperature. However, in the
case of SERS, it can be modiﬁed by underlying reso-
nances associated with the wavelength dependence of the
SERS enhancement factor, making the interpretations
more diﬃcult. The most general expression for the ratio
under SERS conditions at low powers (in the absence of
pumping) and for molecules in thermal equilibrium at a
temperature Tmol) is[16, 17]:

ρ =

= Aω

IAS
IS

σAS
σS

AAS
AS

N

i=1
X

exp(−¯hωv/kBTmol)

(1)

with Aω = (ωL + ωv)4/(ωL − ωv)4 (accounting for the
standard wavelength dependence of Raman processes).
IAS(S) is the intensity of the anti-Stokes (Stokes) Ra-
man mode, ωL(v)
is the frequency of the laser (Ra-
man mode), σAS(S) is the anti-Stokes (Stokes) scattering
cross section of the molecule, N is the number of active
molecules, and AAS(S) is the SERS enhancement factor
at the molecule position at the anti-Stokes(Stokes) fre-
quency. The latter term includes both electromagnetic
and chemical enhancement eﬀects.
In general the en-
hancement can be site dependent and therefore should
be summed over all active sites. Because anti-Stokes sig-
nals are typically small, their measurement requires rela-
tively long integration time and/or large analyte concen-
trations. The results are therefore an average over several
active sites/molecules, each with diﬀerent enhancement
factors and resonances. To account for this averaging, ρ
for a given mode i can be modelled in a ﬁrst approxima-
tion as:

ρi = AωAi exp(−¯hωi/kBT ef f

)

i

(2)

i

where Ai is the average asymmetry factor from resonance
eﬀects (asymmetries in cross sections), which can change
from mode to mode. T ef f
was used in this expression
to account for the possibility of diﬀerent eﬀective mode
temperatures. When the vibrational pumping rate is
small compared to IVR rate, we have T ef f
= Tmol for
all modes and the molecule is in thermal equilibrium at
Tmol. However, if vibrational pumping is not negligible,
this expression needs to be modiﬁed to give (for weak
pumping) [8, 10, 12]:

i

ρi = AωAi [exp(−¯hωi/kBTmol) + σSτrIL]

(3)

where τr is the vibrational relaxation time (including IVR
and other relaxation processes), and IL is the laser inten-
sity in photons per unit time and surface area. We see
in this latest expression that vibrational pumping would
tend to increase the value of ρi. This could alternatively
be described by Eq. (2), using an eﬀective mode temper-
ature T ef f
would require
the use of Eq. (3).

i > Tmol, but determining T ef f

i

Eqs. (2) or (3) form the basis for the analysis of most
SERS experiments about heating/pumping that use aS/S
ratio measurements. From them, it is obvious that the
measurement of ρi only is not suﬃcient to extract Tmol
or T ef f
, as the Ai’s are unknown. One therefore needs
i
an extra free parameter. In previous works, the power
dependence of ρi was for example studied [8, 10, 15].
A linear dependence of ρi with IL has been invoked as
evidence of vibrational pumping which would appear to
follow from Eq. (3). This is not true however and direct
heating of the molecule has been proposed as an alterna-
tive explanation [11]. To understand the eﬀect of heating
on ρ, one can write Tmol = T0 + ∆T , and expand Eq. (2)
considering a small temperature increase, ∆T ≪ T0:

If heating eﬀects are present, ∆T changes with power.
Because heat diﬀusion and transfer models are linear, it
is reasonable to assume that the temperature increase
∆T is proportional to laser power: ∆T = aIL. For a
small temperature increase, the argument in the second
exponential of Eq. (4) is small and expanding it leads to

The linear dependence of ρi (or quadratic dependence of
IAS) with incident power can therefore equally be the
result of conventional heating eﬀects or of pumping. It
is also worth noting that the argument in the second ex-
ponential of Eq. (4) can be comparable to 1, even for
a small ∆T . This can be the case for example for high
energy modes, where ¯hωi/kBT0 can be ≈ 10. The power
dependence of ρi as a result of heating eﬀects would then
be exponential. Such power dependence, linear for low
energy modes, and exponential for high energy modes,
has already been observed [15]. This shows that heating
eﬀects can be important and that a linear power depen-
dence of ρi is not in itself a proof of vibrational pumping.
Instead of using the laser power as an additional pa-
rameter, we propose to study the aS/S ratios of each
mode as a function of substrate temperature T0. As we
shall show, by investigating how these ratios change as
a function of T over a wide range, we can separate the

contributions due to heating and resonance eﬀects.
addition, this approach enables us to detect a departure
from internal thermal equilibrium of the molecule, i.e.
vibrational pumping.

III. EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS

Silver colloids were produced as described in Ref.[18].
SERS samples were prepared by mixing equal amounts
of colloidal and 25 mM KCl solutions together, to which
1 µL of 10−6 M Rhodamine 6G (RH6G) solution was
added, resulting in a 10−9 M RH6G concentration. The

3

sample was then dried onto a Si substrate. The tempera-
ture calibration in terms of aS/S-data of non-SERS active
signals (paracetamol) is described elsewhere[14]. Mea-
surements were carried out with a Renishaw 2000 CCD
spectrometer and an Olympus BH-2 microscope with a
Linkham temperature stage, using both 514 nm Ar+ ion
and 633 nm HeNe lasers with a ×50 long working dis-
tance objective (∼1.5 µm beam diameter at the focal
point). Measurements with the 514 nm laser were made
at 0.5 mW whereas for the 633nm laser were performed
at 0.5 and 5 mW, respectively, in the range between 100
and 350 K in steps of 10 K and integration times varying
from 1 to 30 sec. Five or more measurements were made
to gain an average over the sample. Peaks were then
analyzed using standard Voigt functions with subtracted
backgrounds.

The variation in the aS/S ratio for each mode was ﬁtted
to Eq. (2), with T ef f
i = TSi + ∆Ti., where ∆Ti is the in-
crease in eﬀective mode temperature with respect to the
T of the substrate which is measured by the aS/S-ratio
of the Si substrate[14]. The parameters Ai in Eq. (2)
will depend on the particular mode under consideration,
accounting for the asymmetry in σS and σaS produced
by resonances. Four types of ﬁts were performed:

• ∆T -only, where Ai is set to 1 (no resonance eﬀect)

and ∆Ti are ﬁtting parameters;

• A-only, where ∆Ti = 0 (no local heating, no pump-

ing) and Ai are ﬁtting parameters;

• A+∆T -shared, where ∆Ti = ∆T constant for all
modes and Ai are ﬁtting parameters. This corre-
sponds to the case of internal thermal equilibrium
for the molecule;

• A+∆T , where Ai and ∆Ti are independent ﬁtting
parameters. This allows the modes to have diﬀerent
eﬀective mode temperatures.

Figure 1 illustrates the predictions of the model and
the inﬂuence of A and ∆T on the value of the aS/S-ratio
as a function of T . Figure 1(a) shows the expected value
of the ratio for diﬀerent A’s, whilst keeping ∆T = 0.
When A < 1 (A > 1) the ratio is suppressed (increased).
In Fig.1(b) A is held constant whilst ∆T is varied: the in-
ﬂuence of ∆T is strongest at low T ’s where it is a greater
fraction of the initial T , resulting in a distinctive ‘ﬂar-
ing’ of the ratio at low T ’s and a ﬂattening of the overall
curve shape.

The ﬁrst two types of ﬁts are only used to test whether
a simple model with heating only and no resonances,
or resonances only and no heating, is suﬃcient to ex-
plain the data. For all ﬁts, we assume that Ai and ∆Ti
are constant with temperature. Ai, which is the result
of predominantly electromagnetic resonances, is not be-
lieved to vary with temperature. For molecules in ther-
mal equilibrium ∆Ti = ∆T is the same for all modes and
represent the temperature increase (heating). Many fac-
tors contribute to this increase, for example the thermal

high and low power measurements for the 633 nm laser whilst only low power measurements were possible with the 514 nm

All measurements were made on large colloidal clusters.The A+∆T -shared ﬁtting is not possible for the 514 nm laser as only

properties of the SERS substrate and of the various in-
terfaces. These factors could possibly vary with temper-
ature, although large variations typically occur mainly
at even lower temperatures (T < 100 K). The assump-
tion ∆T =constant is therefore reasonable in a ﬁrst ap-
proximation. The (A+∆T -shared) ﬁt then enables us to
separate the resonance eﬀects (Ai) from the heating ef-
fect (∆T ). If this ﬁt fails, then either ∆T =constant is
wrong, or the molecule is not in internal thermal equi-
librium (i.e. pumping occurs).
In the latter case, the
eﬀective mode temperature T0 + ∆Ti is determined by
the pumping rate, via Eq. (3). The ﬁts with this model
cannot therefore be valid, but the (A+∆T ) ﬁt can still be
useful in identifying which modes present an anomalous
eﬀective mode temperature and are therefore most likely
to be pumped.

If the (A+∆T -shared) ﬁt fails, the model above can-
not distinguish directly between pumping (∆Ti diﬀerent
for diﬀerent modes) and temperature dependent heating
(∆Ti = ∆T , but ∆T varies with T ). In order to prove
that diﬀerent modes cannot be accounted for by a single
T , we propose to deﬁne the following function (for two
modes a and b):

Then, describing each mode by an eﬀective mode tem-
perature, we have from Eq. (2).

where C is a constant accounting for the diﬀerent A-
factors. The advantage of this function is as follows:
if both modes share the same temperature, this func-
tion is constant as a function of T . The function F can
be used to monitor relative changes between the eﬀec-
tive T ’s of two modes as a function of external varying
conditions (here T , but it could also be used to prove
non-equilibrium pumping in a power dependence experi-
ment).

IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

A. Low power

Figure 2 shows examples aS/S ratios as a function of T
for the 610 cm−1 mode of RH6G and 633 nm excitation
(top curve). The theoretically predicted behavior (A=1,
∆T = 0) and the ﬁts to the experimental data using the
(A+∆T ), A-only, and ∆T -only models, are shown. The
experimental data are well approximated by the (A+∆T -
shared) ﬁt for all modes investigated. The ﬁtting to all
the modes, using the four ﬁtting procedures presented
above, is summarized in table I. Figure 2 also shows the
equivalent data for the 610 cm−1 mode under the 514 nm
laser excitation (bottom curve). The aS-peaks associated
with the higher modes were too small to analyze at these
laser powers. The (A + ∆T ) ﬁtting provides the best ﬁt
to the experimental data although ∆T is small and con-
sequently the A only model also ﬁts the data reasonably
well. The ﬁtting results for the 610 cm−1 mode taken

(6)

(7)

using the 514 nm laser are also summarized in table I.

The low power measurements tell us that the molecule
is in thermal equilibrium with a heating of 25K when us-
ing 633nm laser and 3K when using the same low power
514nm laser. Useful insight into the colloidal heating
problem can be gained from considering a simpliﬁed 1-D
model. Consider a single colloid where the laser power
is assumed to dissipate through the top surface with
no lateral heat ﬂow. The T dependence of the ther-
mal conductivity of Ag is small down to 40 K and we
can use the room temperature value. The internal ther-
mal time constant of the colloid (the time for the col-
loid to come to a uniform temperature), τc is given by
τc = CAg
≈ 1 × 10−11(s), where Kc is the thermal con-
Kc
ductance of a single Ag particle (of size ∼ (20 × 10−9
m)3) and CAg is the phononic contribution to the spe-
ciﬁc heat with Debye temperature, ΘAg given by: CAg =
≈ 6.1 × 10−17(J/K).
cAg
In this latter expression WAg is the atomic weight of
Ag, DAg its density, d the length of the colloid and
cAg ≈ 7.8×101(J/M ol.K). We ignore the electronic con-
tribution to cAg as it is much smaller than the phonon
contribution, except at liquid He temperatures.

(cid:1)

Assuming an incident power 1 mW is focussed into a 1
µm2 area with a reﬂectivity of 80%, the number of pho-
tons absorbed per second by the colloid is ≈ 2.6×1011s−1.
Note that when dealing with small objects, τc is compa-
rable to the arrival rate of the photons. The dynamics
of the system is therefore rather interesting. The ab-
sorption of a single photon increases the colloid’s upper
surface temperature by ≈ 5.2 × 10−3 K. By modelling
the acoustic mismatch between Ag and Si[19], we can
estimate the expected increase in T . Estimating val-
ues from experimental data for interfaces between Al-
Al2O3 and Pb-diamond, we ﬁnd temperature increases
of 2 and 10 K, respectively, which are the of the right
order of magnitude for our low power observations using
the 633nm laser. This is remarkable when we consider
that we have ignored any potential contribution origi-
nating from SERS hot-spots and that the thermal model
is extremely simpliﬁed. This model supports the sce-
nario that at low powers the molecules could be heating
through direct interaction with the colloids.

B. High power

Figure 3 shows ρ as a function of T for the 610 and
1510 cm−1 modes for high power (5 mW) 633 nm exci-
tation, while all other parameters were identical to the
measurements at low power. We show the resulting ﬁts of
(A+∆T ) for both modes, as well as secondary ﬁts swap-
ping the temperatures and the theoretically expected ρ’s.
The high power ratios for all the modes were also ﬁt-
ted using the (A+∆T -shared) model as in the low power
data. This resulted in a ∆T = 96 K whereas the low
power results gave 25 K. Although this is clearly larger,
as would be expected, the quality of the ﬁts were badly

5

compromised for the high power data, as measured by a
χ2-test (not shown in the table). This indicates that this
model is no longer valid in this regime. The results of the
ﬁtting to the high power, 633 nm data for all the modes
is also summarized in table I. The 610 cm−1 ratio as a
function of T at high power is similar to that obtained at
low powers; when plotted on the same graph it is almost
impossible to separate them by eye suggesting that the
mode temperature is not too dissimilar, despite an order
of magnitude diﬀerence in the incident power. Indeed,
the result of the (A+∆T ) ﬁtting of the 610 cm−1 mode
in both cases gives ∆T = 17 ± 5 K for low power and ∆T
= 40 ± 5 K for high power, which is diﬃcult to visualize
on a log-scale. For the 1510 cm−1 mode, although there
is a great deal of scatter, there is a noticeable diﬀerence
in the trend of the data when compared with the low
power measurement. This behavior is very similar to the
‘ﬂaring’ of the theoretically determined ρ’s for high ∆T
as shown in ﬁgure 1. This is conﬁrmed with the ﬁtting of
the data to the (A+∆T ) model which results in ∆T1510
= 200 ± 40 K; i.e. much larger than the T610 = 40 ± 5 K
from the best ﬁt to the 610 cm−1 mode at high power.
Figure 3 also shows ﬁts for the 610 and 1510 cm−1 modes
with ∆T610 =200K and ∆T1510 = 40, both with the best
ﬁt value of A for that mode. It is obvious from these ﬁts
that the 610 cm−1 mode is much cooler than the 1510
cm−1. All these results suggest that vibrational pump-
ing in the 1510 cm−1 mode could be the explanation for
the failure of the (A+∆T -shared) ﬁts.

In order to conﬁrm this hypothesis, we plot in Fig. 4,
the function F , discussed in the previous section, which
compares the eﬀective T ’s of (a) the 780 and 610 cm−1
modes and (b) the 1510 and 610 cm−1 modes in (b). The
monotonic departure from a constant observed in (b) is
an additional demonstration of non thermal equilibrium
between these two modes and therefore in the molecule.
This conﬁrms that the failure of the (A+∆T -shared) ﬁts
is a consequence of vibrational pumping, and not of a
temperature dependent heating (same ∆T for all modes,
but varying with temperature). In fact, the data in Fig.
4 show not only evidence for mode speciﬁc pumping but
also highlights the limitations of the A+∆T model. The
kink in F as a function of T means that the 1510, 780,
and 610 cm−1 modes share a single T above ∼ 200 K,
whilst below that the 1510 cm−1 shows some mode spe-
ciﬁc pumping. This is only taken into account approxi-
mately in the A+∆T model, and Eq. (3) needs to be used
to account for pumping properly. Fits using Eqs. (3) and
(6) are also shown in Fig. 4 and are in good agreement
with the data. Moreover, we extract from the ﬁt for the
1510 cm−1 mode a value of σSτrIL = 5 × 10−5. We es-
timate IL ≈ 1024 photons/cm2 and typical values for τr
are in the range 1–10 ps. This leads to σS in the range
5×10−16−5×10−15, compatible with previous estimate of
the SERS cross section. The study of the T -dependence
of the function F therefore provide additional evidence
that the behavior of the 1510 cm−1 below 200 K is a mani-
festation of vibrational pumping in this mode. This eﬀect

is more prominent at low T and for higher energy modes
because the equilibrium population of the excited vibra-
tional state is then very small and the relative change
in intensity is larger. Following this argument, further
evidence for pumping could be obtained from measure-
ments at even lower temperatures (T < 100K) than the
ones accessed in here. We note that the original paper
on SERS pumping also presented some evidence for mode
dependent eﬀects[8]. Our results certainly contribute to
this body of work and suggest that several mechanisms
(vibrational pumping, underlying resonances, and colloid
or SERS substrate heating) operate simultaneously and
contribute together to the aS/S ratio anomalies.

In summary, we detail the key results presented in ta-
ble I as follows: (i) The (A+∆T -shared) model provides
a satisfying agreement at low powers. The molecule is
then in thermal equilibrium with a heating of ∼ 25 K
with respect to the substrate for the 633 nm laser, but
only a 3 K rise for 514 nm excitation. (ii) Models with
only A or ∆T alone as ﬁtting parameters systematically
produce worse overall agreement with the data or even
unphysical values, like negative heating (see for example
the 610 cm−1 mode at 514 nm excitation in table I). (iii)
For high powers using the 633 nm laser, an overall shared
∆T among the modes is not possible and one is forced
to a better quality ﬁt by allowing diﬀerent eﬀective tem-

peratures for diﬀerent modes. Using the function F , one
can then demonstrate that this is the result of vibrational
pumping in the 1510 cm−1 mode.

V. CONCLUSION

In closing, we have observed a laser frequency depen-
dent heating of the order of 25 K at low laser power under
SERS conditions with 633 nm excitation. We have shown
that it is possible to decouple in dry samples the contri-
butions of the thermal population and resonances in the
aS/S ratios by performing a T -scan, thus overcoming the
basic uncertainty in the diﬀerent relative contributions
which exist in studies at a single T . Most importantly we
have used this technique to provide evidence for at least
two possible scenarios: molecule in thermal equilibrium
at low powers and mode speciﬁc pumping at high powers.
Experiments at lower temperatures are in progress and
will be reported elsewhere.

case of ∆T , the eﬀect on the anti-Stokes/Stokes ratio varies
across the full temperature range with the largest eﬀect being
made at lower temperatures where ∆T represents a greater
percentage of the initial temperature. This results in a ‘ﬂar-
ing out’ of the ratio at lower temperatures which is noticeably
larger for greater values of ∆T .

633 nm and 514 nm lasers at low power (0.5 mW). There is a
clear diﬀerent in the resonance contribution to the anomalous
ratios between these lasers as the 633 nm ratio is increased
above the theoretical value whilst the 514 nm ratio is sup-
pressed below the theoretical. The solid lines represent the

the dashed and dash dot represent the ﬁts obtained from us-

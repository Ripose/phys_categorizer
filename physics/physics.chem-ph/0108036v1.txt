Abstract

The heats of formation of haloacetylenes are evaluated using the recent W1

and W2 ab initio computational thermochemistry methods. These calcula-

tions involve CCSD and CCSD(T) coupled cluster methods, basis sets of

up to spdfgh quality, extrapolations to the one-particle basis set limit, and

contributions of inner-shell correlation, scalar relativistic eﬀects, and (where

relevant) ﬁrst-order spin-orbit coupling. The heats of formation determined

using W2 theory are: ∆Hf

298(HCCH) = 54.48 kcal/mol, ∆Hf

298(HCCF) =

25.15 kcal/mol, ∆Hf

298(FCCF) = 1.38 kcal/mol, ∆Hf

298(HCCCl) = 54.83

kcal/mol, ∆Hf

298(ClCCCl) = 56.21 kcal/mol, and ∆Hf

298(FCCCl) = 28.47

kcal/mol. Enthalpies of hydrogenation and destabilization energies relative to

acetylene were obtained at the W1 level of theory. So doing we ﬁnd the follow-

ing destabilization order for acetylenes: FCCF > ClCCF > HCCF > ClCCCl

> HCCCl > HCCH. By a combination of W1 theory and isodesmic reactions,

1

we show that the generally accepted heat of formation of 1,2-dichloroethane

should be revised to -31.8±0.6 kcal/mol, in excellent agreement with a very

recent critically evaluated review. The performance of compound thermo-

chemistry schemes such as G2, G3, G3X and CBS-QB3 theories has been

analyzed.

I. INTRODUCTION

There is continuing interest in the thermochemistry of halogenated species [1], as there

is in the reaction chemistry of halogenated acetylenes [2]. However, there remains no di-

rect determination of the heat of formation of any haloacetylene — these species are sim-

ply too unstable and/or reactive to allow for such measurements [3]. Analysis of mixed

phase equilibration measurements [4] result in a suggested value of 5.0±5.0 kcal/mol for

diﬂuoroacetylene, while the same source gives estimated values of 47.9±10.0 kcal/mol for

dichloroacetylene, and 30.0±15.1 and 51.1±10.0 kcal/mol for HCCF and HCCCl, respec-

tively. The error bars are large; the estimation methods assume constancy and additivity

approximations that are inadequately aﬃrmed for the energetics of halogenated species [1].

In such circumstances, the only means of acquiring the needed data is through computations.

A number of theoretical studies on thermochemical properties of halocarbons have been

carried out (see Ref. [5,6] and references therein) in the past, because of their adverse ef-

fects on the ozone layer and high global warming potentials. While there have been nu-

merous studies on saturated halocarbons, there is a paucity of thermochemical data for

haloacetylenes and the available data are inconsistent. For example, Colegrove and Thomp-

son [7] evaluated the heats of formation of several chlorinated hydrocarbons in which they

reported the ∆Hf

298 of HCCH as 56.47 and 56.24 kcal/mol at the G1 and G2 theories re-

spectively, while Rodriquez et al. [8] found the enthalpies of formation at 298 K for HCCH

and HCCCl at the MP4STDQ/6-311G(2df,p) level as 51.7 and 51.4 kcal/mol respectively.

At MP4STDQ/6-311++G(3df,3pd) level, they found the ∆Hf

298 of HCCH as 55.7 kcal/mol.

Wiberg and Rablen [9] reported the heat of formation at 0 K of HCCH as 56.0 kcal/mol

at G2 level of theory. It is worth mentioning that Schaefer and co-workers [10] investigated

the ﬂuorovinylidene-ﬂuoroacetylene isomerization reaction on the C2HF singlet ground-state

potential energy surface at the CCSD(T)/TZ2P level of theory. In the study of vinyl chloride

and bromide, Radom and co-workers [11] reported the structure of chloroacetylene at the

CISD(Q) and MP4 level of theory using the 6-31G(d) basis set. Very recently, Breidung and

3

Thiel [12] studied the equilibirium structure and spectroscopic constants of diﬂuorovinylidene

(F2CC) at the CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVQZ level of theory including core correlation eﬀects. In

this study, they have also reported the thermodynamic stability of F2CC (less stable by 29

kcal/mol) relative to FCCF as well as the barrier height (38 kcal/mol) for the isomerization

from F2CC to FCCF. Earlier, experimental evidence for the existence of F2CC was shown by

Breidung et al. [13] in the matrix isolation study, in which F2CC was generated by 193-nm

laser photolysis of FCCF.

Recently, one of us proposed two new computational thermochemistry protocols known

as W1 and W2 (Weizmann-1 and -2) theory, [14,15] which permits the computation of total

atomization energies of small molecules in the kJ/mol accuracy range. For the total atom-

ization energies of its ”training set” of molecules, the more economical W1 theory achieved

a mean absolute error of 0.37 kcal/mol, which goes down to 0.22 kcal/mol for the more

rigorous W2 theory, for which imperfections in the CCSD(T) electron correlation method

[16] are the main accuracy-limiting factor. In a subsequent validation study [17], we have

shown that W1 and W2 theories yield thermochemical data in the kJ/mol accuracy range

for most of the G2/97 data set that are well described by a single reference conﬁguration.

The XCCY [X=H, F, Cl] compounds are well within the applicability range of W2 theory

even with moderately powerful computing equipment.

In the present study, we will carry out W2 calculations for all species concerned. W1

results will however also be presented, in order to establish convergence of our calculated

results in terms of the level of theory.

In addition, W1 results are used to calculate the

enthalpy of hydrogenation to form substituted alkanes. Finally, we will evaluate the perfor-

mance of some popular computational thermochemistry protocols compared to the present

benchmark results.

Most ab initio calculations (speciﬁcally, the CCSD [18] and CCSD(T) coupled cluster

calculations involved in Wn theory) were carried out using MOLPRO 98.1 [19] running

II. METHODS

4

on SGI Origin 2000 and Compaq ES40 minisupercomputers at the Weizmann Institute of

Science.

(For the open-shell calculations on the constituent atoms, the deﬁnition of the

open-shell CCSD and CCSD(T) energies in Ref. [20], as implemented [21], was employed.)

Some frequency calculations using the B3LYP (Becke 3-parameter-Lee-Yang-Parr) den-

sity functional method [22,23] involved in the determination of the zero-point vibrational

energies were carried out using Gaussian 98 [24] running on these same machines. Finally,

for comparison purposes, some calculations using the G2 [25] and G3 [26] theories of Pople

and coworkers, as well as using the CBS-QB3 method of Petersson and coworkers [27], were

carried out using the implementations of these methods in Gaussian 98.

The rationale and justiﬁcation of the W1 and W2 methods are discussed at length else-

where [14,15]. In the interest of making this paper self-contained, we brieﬂy summarize the

computational protocols here:

• the geometry is optimized at the appropriate level of theory, which for W1 is B3LYP/cc-

pVTZ+1 and for W2 is CCSD(T)/cc-pVQZ+1, in which cc-pVTZ and cc-pVQZ are the

Dunning correlation consistent [28] polarized valence triple and quadruple zeta basis

sets [29], respectively, and the suﬃx ”+1” refers to the addition of a high-exponent d

function on all second-row atoms to cover inner polarization eﬀects [30]. Only valence

electrons are correlated in the CCSD(T) calculation;

• a CCSD calculation with only valence electrons correlated is carried out for a ”big”

basis set (see below) containing basis functions of at most angular momentum Lmax;

• CCSD(T) calculations with only valence electrons correlated are carried out for a

”small” (at most Lmax − 2) and a ”medium” (at most Lmax − 1) basis set (see be-

low);

• the SCF component of the atomization energy is extrapolated geometrically [31]

(E[L] = E∞ + A/L5) to the ”medium”, and ”large” basis set results;

• the CCSD valence correlation component is extrapolated using the Schwartz-type ex-

5

pression [32,33] A + B/Lα to the ”medium” and ”large” basis set results. α=3.0 for

W2 theory, 3.22 for W1 theory;

• the (T) valence correlation component is extrapolated using the same expression, but

applied to the ”small” and ”medium” results only;

• the inner-shell correlation contribution is calculated as the diﬀerence between valence-

only and all-electrons-correlated CCSD(T)/MTsmall binding energies, where MTsmall

stands for the Martin-Taylor ’small’ core correlation basis set [34,35] deﬁned in Ref.

[14];

in this step;

• the scalar relativistic contribution is obtained as the expectation values of the one-

electron Darwin and mass-velocity operators [36,37] from an ACPF (averaged coupled

pair functional [38]) calculation with the MTsmall basis set. All electrons are correlated

• except for systems in degenerate states (for which an explicit spin-orbit calculation is

required), the spin-orbit contribution is normally derived from the atomic ﬁne struc-

tures of the constituent atoms.

In standard W2 theory, the basis sets employed are Dunning’s cc-pVLZ on H, aug-cc-pVLZ

[39] on B–F, and aug-cc-pVLZ+2d1f on Al–Cl, where the ”+2d1f” suﬃx indicates the ad-

dition of two high-exponent d and one high-exponent f function, the exponents being ob-

tained as geometric series 2.5nα, where α is the highest exponent of that angular momentum

present in the underlying cc-pVLZ basis set. For the ”small”, ”medium”, and ”large” basis

sets, L=T, Q, and 5, respectively. In standard W1 theory, the basis sets employed are as

described above except for L=D, T, and Q, respectively, for ”small”, ”medium”, and ”large”.

(For Al–Cl, the ”small” basis set is aug-cc-pVDZ+2d.)

Our best calculations in the present work were carried out using a minor variation on

the W2 protocol of Martin and de Oliveira, which we shall denote W2h (h standing for

hetero-atom) in this paper. It diﬀers from standard W2 theory in that the aug-cc-pVLZ

6

basis sets are only used for group V, VI, and VII elements, while the regular cc-pVLZ basis

set is used for group III and IV elements.

Zero-point energies were obtained from B3LYP/cc-pVTZ+1 harmonic frequencies scaled

by 0.985 in both the W1 and W2 cases, and thermodynamic functions computed using the

RRHO (rigid rotor-harmonic oscillator) method from the B3LYP/cc-pVTZ+1 rotational

constants and harmonic frequencies. In the cases of HCCF, HCCCl, and C2H2, anharmonic

zero-point energies are available from the literature for comparison.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Optimized geometries at the B3LYP/cc-pVTZ+1 and CCSD(T)/cc-pVQZ+1 levels of

theory are given in Table I. Computed total atomization energies and heats of formation

for the various species discussed here are given in Table II, together with the constituent

components (SCF, CCSD valence correlation, connected triple excitations, inner-shell cor-

relation, scalar relativistic eﬀects, spin-orbit coupling). Finally, the reaction energies (and

constituent components) for a number of isodesmic and isogyric reactions discussed below

can be found in Table III.

Comparing the W1 and W2h TAEe (total atomization energy at the bottom of the well)

suggests that the two treatments are in good agreement with each other, except for C2F2

where the more rigorous W2h method suggests a TAEe value about 0.97 kcal/mol lower

than W1. Analysis of the individual contributions reveals that the diﬀerence is evenly split

between SCF and CCSD valence correlation; we also note that HCCF, CH3F and FCCCl all

reveal about half the W1–W2h diﬀerence of C2F2.

The W2 and W2h protocols normally call for anharmonic zero-point vibrational energies

(ZPVE values), e.g.

from CCSD(T)/cc-pVTZ (or better) quartic force ﬁeld calculations.

Accurate ab initio anharmonic force ﬁelds are available for acetylene [40] and HCCF [41]

from the work of Martin and coworkers, and for C2F2 and C2Cl2 from the work of Thiel

and coworkers [42,43]. From comparing the W1 and W2h entries for the ZPVE in Table II,

we see that the scaled harmonic B3LYP/cc-pVTZ+1 ZPVEs diﬀer by up to 0.24 kcal/mol

7

(C2H2) from the more rigorous values. Since this is comparable to the expected accuracy of

W2 and W2h theory themselves, it is worthwhile to substitute the anharmonic values when

at all available. For FCCCl, an anharmonic force ﬁeld calculation was published [44], but

the anharmonicity constants or force ﬁeld were not explicitly reported in that paper: hence

no zero point energy could be derived. We have adopted the assumption that the small

diﬀerence between the scaled B3LYP and the rigorous values could be interpolated between

C2F2 and C2Cl2; a similar approximation was adopted for HCCCl (interpolation between

C2H2 and C2Cl2).

Let us ﬁrst consider some of the species involved in the isodesmic reactions. Computed

and WebBook [45] heats of formation for CH4 are, not surprisingly, in perfect agreement.

Our W2h value for C2H2 agrees to within overlapping uncertainties with the WebBook value.

For CH3F, the WebBook lists two heats of formation:

-56.0 kcal/mol from the JANAF

tables [4] and -59.0 kcal/mol from Lias et al. [46]. Our calculations clearly favor the former

value. Likewise, two experimental values are available for CH3Cl: -19.59±0.16 kcal/mol from

Fletcher and Pilcher [47] and -20.53±0.14 kcal/mol from Lacher et al [48]. Our calculations

agree well with the latter value.

Only rather crude estimates are available for the haloacetylenes themselves (see Table

II): our calculations agree with them to within the former’s stated error bars, but given the

magnitude thereof this is a rather hollow victory.

Let us consider a particularly simple estimation method and associated constancy and

additivity, namely the assumption of thermoneutrality for the reaction

HC≡CH + XC≡CX → 2 HC≡CX

(1)

For X=CH3 (using values from Ref. [49] for the parent acetylene, 2-butyne, and propyne of

54.5±0.2, 34.8±0.3, and 44.2±0.2 kcal/mol, respectively), this reaction is slightly exothermic

(by 0.9±0.5 kcal/mol). This is comfortably close to thermoneutrality, to the extent that

it suggests, as one would expect for hydrocarbons, constant triply bonded Benson group

increments, Ct-(C) and Ct-(H). By contrast, for X=F, we ﬁnd the reaction to be exothermic

by 5.42 kcal/mol at the W2h level(see Table III), compared to only 1.03 kcal/mol for X=Cl.

8

It is noteworthy that in both cases, the SCF component accounts for essentially all of the

eﬀect, suggesting that a simple explanation must exist in the structure of the zero-order

wave function. We also note that the exchange reaction C2F2+C2Cl2→2 FCCCl is mildly

exothermic, by 0.64 kcal/mol, consisting chieﬂy of an SCF component which is exothermic by

1.22 kcal/mol and a valence correlation component which is endothermic by 0.52 kcal/mol.

Furthermore we note that the reactions

HC≡CH + CH3X → HC≡CX + CH4

HC≡CX + CH3X → XC≡CX + CH4

(2)

(3)

are fairly mildly endothermic for X=Cl (2.43 and 3.46 kcal/mol, respectively, at 298 K), but

pronouncedly endothermic for X=F (9.32 and 14.74 kcal/mol, respectively). For comparison,

W1 results are also presented in Table III; these are in excellent agreement with W2h values.

Considering the bond distances in Table I, we see that the C≡C bond distance in the

chloroacetylenes changes only marginally from the acetylene value; in contrast, the C≡C

bond in HCCF is compressed by 0.0060 ˚A at the CCSD(T)/cc-pVQZ+1 level. The compres-

sion from HCCF to FCCF is still more pronounced, namely 0.0103 ˚A at the same level of

theory. (A parallel trend can be noted in the harmonic frequency for the CC stretch, which

mounts from 2013 cm−1 in acetylene [40] over 2279 cm−1 in HCCF to 2527 cm−1 in C2F2.)

The reason for this probably lies in the changing importance of ionic contributions of the

type Y-C≡C− X+: while for acetylene these play a nonnegligible role (after all, acetylene is

a very weak acid in aqueous solution), such valence bond structures are quite unfavorable

for mono- and particularly for diﬂuoroacetylene.

In all haloacetylenes considered here, the C-X bond distances are appreciably shorter

than in CH3X. This is consistent with the existence of resonance eﬀects of the type

H − C≡C − X ↔ H − C− = C = X+

(4)

as are the Wiberg bond orders [50] (derived from a natural population analysis [51] on

the B3LYP/cc-pVTZ+1 wave function) in Table IV. (The signiﬁcant vicinal Wiberg bond

9

(5)

(6)

orders BO(XC′) found there are perhaps a clearer indication for this type of resonance

than the increased X-C bond orders relative to CH3X.) Such resonance would stabilize the

haloacetylenes: on the other hand, they would be a great deal less favorable in HCCF than

in HCCCl, and deﬁnitely less in FCCF than in ClCCCl. In addition, it would appear to be

less eﬃcient in dihalides than in monohalides:

Y − C ≡ C − X ↔ Y − C− = C = X+

The Wiberg bond orders in Table IV do appear to reﬂect these trends.

A useful probe of substituent eﬀects on acetylene stability is the enthalpy of the hydro-

genation to form the related substituted alkane [52]:

X − C ≡ C − Y + 2 H2 → X − CH2CH2 − Y

Before discussing the ﬂuorinated and chlorinated species of direct interest in this text, we

start with simpler, better known substituents. For the parent acetylene [53] with X = Y = H,

the gas phase (355K) hydrogenation enthalpy was shown to be -75.1 ± 0.7 kcal/mol by Conn,

Kistiakowsky and Smith in excellent agreement with the presently computed (W1) value of

-75.5 kcal/mol. By contrast, in hydrocarbon solution (and thus mimicking the gas phase)

Rogers, Dagdagan and Allinger [54] showed that mono-n alkylacetylenes typically have a

hydrogenation enthalpy of ca. -69 and di-n-alkylacetylenes have a value of ca. -64 kcal/mol.

Ignoring temperature and solvent eﬀects, this 5 kcal/mol stabilization per alkyl group is con-

sonant with general perceptions regarding both hyperconjugative and hybridization eﬀects

of alkylation. Phenylation is expected to result in a larger, mostly conjugatively derived,

stabilization. Under the same conditions as these alkylated acetylenes, Davis, Allinger and

Rogers [55] showed that phenylacetylene and n-alkylphenylacetylenes have an enthalpy of

hydrogenation of ca. -62 and -59.6 ± 0.5 kcal/mol, respectively, documenting the greater

stabilizing eﬀect of phenyl groups over alkyl.

Not surprisingly, there are no direct measurements of the enthalpy of hydrogenation of

any of the haloacetylenes. In order to obtain such quantity, accurate enthalpy of formation of

haloethanes is required. But reliable experimental thermochemical data for the haloethanes

10

is scarce and typically is derived from one or two sources. Therefore, we have calculated the

enthalpies of formation of ethane and the haloethanes at the W1 level of theory: the results

are presented in Table V. Since the core correlation contributions for 1,2-dichloroethane and

1-ﬂuoro-2-chloroethane are computationally very expensive to calculate, we have estimated

those values using the MSFT bond equivalent model proposed by Martin et al. [56]. Table VI

shows the W1 reaction energies for the hydrogenation reactions together with the constituent

components.

We ﬁrst note that the the W1 calculated ∆Hf

298of C2H6 value (-21.18 kcal/mol) diﬀers

by about 1.1 kcal from the experimental value [57] of -20.08 ± 0.10 kcal/mol. (Note that the

discrepancy is reduced to -0.7 kcal/mol at the W2 level, with some of the remaining error

probably due to lack of account for internal rotation in the zero-point and thermal correc-

tions.) From Table VI, it also be seen that the acetylene hydrogenation energy calculated

at the W1 level (-75.54 kcal/mol) is in excellent agreement with the experimental value of

-75.51 ± 0.7 kcal/mol [53].

In the literature, directly or even indirectly measured enthalpy of formation of C2H5F

are lacking. But we ﬁnd few theoretical values based on empirical schemes, -65.06 kcal/mol

from Smith [58] and -66.30 ± 1.00 kcal/mol from Luo and Benson [59]. In addition, there

are enthalpy of combustion measurements of some long-chain n-alkyl ﬂuorides by R¨uchardt,

et al. [60]. In particular, for the ﬂuorinated nonane, dodecane and tetradecane, enthalpies

of formation of -101.2 ± 0.6, -116.9 ± 0.2 and -127.4 ± 0.2 kcal/mol were reported. These

correspond to a methylene increment of ca. 5.3 kcal/mol, quite close to the 4.93 kcal/mol

generally recommended [61]. Extrapolating to the two carbon ethyl ﬂuoride results in an

estimated enthalpy of formation of about -65 kcal/mol. In this study, we have calculated

the ∆Hf

298 of C2H5F as -66.41 kcal/mol at the W1 level of theory, favoring the empirical

value obtained by Luo and Benson. Combining the W1 value with our suggested heat of

formation of 24.76 kcal/mol for HCCF, we deduce an enthalpy of hydrogenation of -91.12

kcal/mol, and so a calculated destabilization of 15.58 kcal/mol is found.

Concerning C2H5Cl, we ﬁnd two experimental values for the enthalpy of formation of

11

C2H5Cl, -26.84 ±0.18 kcal/mol from Fletcher and Pilcher and -25.72 ± 0.14 kcal/mol from

Lacher et al [48]. In the recent W1/W2 validation study [17] we reported the ∆Hf

298[C2H5Cl]

= -27.75 kcal/mol at the W1 level of theory. The discrepancy with Fletcher and Pilcher is

nearly identical to the W1 error for the parent ethane molecule: hence our calculations

would appear to favor this value. Combining the reported W1 value of ∆Hf

298[C2H5Cl] with

the presently calculated W1 enthalpy of formation of HCCCl (54.90 kcal/mol), we derive a

hydrogenation enthalpy of -82.61 kcal/mol. In other words, HCCCl is destabilized by ca.

7.07 kcal/mol relative to acetylene.

To our knowledge, no experimental enthalpies of formation have been reported for 1,2-

diﬂuoroethane and 1-ﬂuoro-2-chloroethane. We have calculated the W1 enthalpy of forma-

tion of trans-1,2-diﬂuoroethane and trans-1-ﬂuoro-2-chloroethane needed for evaluating the

destabilization of FCCF and FCCCl, respectively. Combining the values of ∆Hf

298of FCH2–

CH2Cl (-71.06 kcal/mol) and FC≡CCl (28.12 kcal/mol) yields hydrogenation and destabi-

lization energies of -99.14 and 23.60 kcal/mol, respectively. For FCCF, we deduce an enthalpy

of hydrogenation of -108.26 kcal/mol, and a calculated destabilization of 32.72 kcal/mol from

the W1 ∆H ◦

f,298 of FCH2–CH2F (-107.83 kcal/mol) and FC≡CF (0.48 kcal/mol).

Combining the W1 calculated ∆H ◦

f,298[ClCH2CH2Cl]=-33.19 kcal/mol with the W1
f,298[ClC≡CCl]=+56.46 kcal/mol, we deduce an enthalpy of hydrogenation of -89.60

∆H ◦

kcal/mol, and hence a destabilization of 14.06 kcal/mol. Our calculated heat of formation

for 1,2-dichloroethane diﬀers by about 3 kcal/mol from the experimental value of -29.97 ±

0.24 kcal/mol reported by Lacher, Amador and Park [62]. This discrepancy is an order

of magnitude larger than the average error of W1 theory for atomization energies [14,17],

and the molecule does not exhibit strong nondynamical correlation eﬀect that could cause

failure of the underlying CCSD(T) electron correlation method.

In order to rule out an

exceptionally large W1 error, let us consider enthalpy changes for the following isodesmic

reactions:

C2H6 + ClCH2CH2Cl → 2 C2H5Cl

C2H6 + CH3Cl → C2H5Cl + CH4

12

(7)

(8)

C2H5Cl + CH3Cl → ClCH2CH2Cl + CH4

C2H6 + 2 CH3Cl → ClCH2CH2Cl + 2 CH4

(9)

(10)

For reaction (7), the two experimental heats of formation of ethyl chloride, -26.84 and -25.72

kcal/mol, would lead to ∆Hr=-3.63 and -1.39 kcal/mol, respectively. At the W1 level, we

ﬁnd ∆Hr=-1.13 kcal/mol, a number that should be basically exact for a simple isodesmic

reaction of the eq. (7) type. Hence the ﬁrst combination of experimental values can be

rejected out of hand. The second one would imply that W1 theory be 2 kcal/mol oﬀ for

ethyl chloride.

The ∆Hr=-3.42 kcal/mol for eq. (9) should likewise be basically exact. The two experi-

mental value combinations would lead to ∆Hr=-1.43 and -2.55 kcal/mol, respectively: again

the former value combination can be rejected outright, while the discrepancy of the latter

with our W1 calculations for a reaction as simple as eq. (9) is somewhat hard to accept.

For eq. (8), the experimentally derived ∆Hr=-5.06 and -3.94 kcal/mol, respectively, bracket

the W1 value, -4.55 kcal/mol, and hence do not allow us to make a decision. Combining

eqs. (8,9) into eq.(10), however, we can eliminate the ethyl chloride value: again considering

that we are dealing with a simple isodesmic reaction, the experimentally derived ∆Hr=-6.49

kcal/mol is rather hard to reconcile with the W1 value of -7.97 kcal/mol. If we combine the

W1 isodesmic reaction energy with the experimental data (and accompanying error bars)

ethane, methane, and methyl chloride, we obtain a revised ∆H ◦

f,298=-31.45±0.33 kcal/mol

(the errors being treated as standard deviations, not upper limits).

Alternatively, if we consider the W1 error for ethane to be transferable to substituted

ethanes, then we ﬁnd ∆H ◦

f [C2H5Cl]=-26.65 kcal/mol, within the error bar of the Fletcher

and Pilcher value. Analogously, we obtain ∆H ◦

f [ClCH2CH2Cl]=-32.09 kcal/mol. Taking the

average of both approaches, and conservatively setting the error bar to twice the diﬀerence

between the values, we obtain a best estimate ∆H ◦

f [ClCH2CH2Cl]=-31.8±0.6 kcal/mol.

After the present paper was submitted for publication, we received a preprint [63]

of a critically evaluated review of experimental thermochemical data for small chlorocar-

bons and chlorohydrocarbons. In said review, ∆H ◦

f [ClCH2CH2Cl]=-133.0±3.0 kJ/mol, or

13

-31.8±0.7 kcal/mol, is proposed, in excellent agreement with our best theoretical predictions.

Summarizing the destabilization energies of substituted haloacetylenes (FCCF=32.72,

ClCCF=23.60, HCCF=15.58, ClCCCl=14.06 and HCCCl=7.07 kcal/mol), we can clearly

see that the destabilization decreases in the order FCCF > ClCCF > HCCF > ClCCCl >

HCCCl, in which ﬂuorine and chlorine atoms contribute about 16 and 7 kcal/mol, respec-

tively.

Finally, it is worthwhile to consider the component breakdown of the reaction energies

(Table VI) which shows that the hydrogenation enthalpies to be almost entirely governed by

SCF contribution. Core correlation contribution is noticable for ﬂuorine containing systems

while the contribution from scalar relativistic eﬀect is less than 0.1 kcal/mol in all cases.

The ﬁrst-order spin-orbit contribution trivially cancels for the reaction energies.

An evaluation of the performance of some common lower-cost thermochemistry methods

(such as G2, G3, and CBS-QB3) would appear to be relevant here. The discrepancies in

TAE0 with the benchmark W2h results are summarized in Table VII. Deviations for W1

theory are quite moderate, with C2F2 being the only outlier (+0.75 kcal/mol): with this one

exception, individual errors stay well below 0.5 kcal/mol, and the mean absolute deviation

(MAD) is 0.27 kcal/mol, slightly higher than the average accuracy of W2/W2h theory itself

over its training set. The next best performer is G3 theory (MAD=0.51 kcal/mol), which

however has a pretty large error of -1.68 kcal/mol for CH3Cl. While we have seen in the past

that CBS-QB3 performs remarkably well on some molecules that are highly problematic for

G3 theory (like SiF4 [64] and SO3 [65]), its MAD for the present systems is 0.75 kcal/mol,

substantially higher than G3 theory. Four systems (as opposed to a single one for G3 theory)

have errors exceeding 1 kcal/mol. Finally, the present results do show that G3 theory

represents a considerable improvement over G2 theory (MAD=0.90 kcal/mol). Interestingly,

the more recent G3X method [66] in fact performs more poorly than G3 theory for the

problem under study (MAD =0.68 kcal/mol, worst-case 1.36 kcal/mol for C2F2).

IV. CONCLUSIONS

Benchmark ab initio calculations have been carried out on the experimentally poorly

known heats of formation of the ﬂuoroacetylenes XCCY (X,Y=H,F,Cl). Our best calcu-

lated values, obtained using a minor variant of the recently proposed Weizmann-2 (W2)

method, are, at 0 (298) K: HCCH 54.66 (54.48) kcal/mol; HCCF 25.07 (25.15) kcal/mol;

FCCF 0.79(1.38) kcal/mol; HCCCl 54.69(54.83) kcal/mol; C2Cl2 55.49(56.21) kcal/mol; and

FCCCl 27.85(28.47) kcal/mol. To these values we conservatively aﬃx error bars of 0.50

kcal/mol, i.e. slightly more than twice the mean absolute error of W2 theory for a ”train-

ing set” of experimentally very precisely known heats of formation. Analysis of the results

using isodesmic reactions reveals that some of the assumptions on which the experimentally

derived estimates are based in fact do not hold particularly well in this case. Calculated

hydrogenation energies of substituted haloacetylenes suggest that ﬂuorine and chlorine atom

substitutions destabilize the acetylene by nearly 16 and 7 kcal/mol apiece, respectively. By a

combination of W1 theory and isodesmic reactions, we show that the established heat of for-

mation of 1,2-dichloroethane should be revised to -31.8±0.6 kcal/mol, in excellent agreement

with a very recent critically evaluated review. Comparing our best heat of formation val-

ues with those obtained using various computationally less expensive schemes, we ﬁnd that

agreement is best for W1 theory, followed by G3 theory; the G3X and CBS-QB3 method

appears to perform more poorly for this particular problem.

Extracting molecular Hamiltonian structure from

time-dependent ﬂuorescence intensity data

Abstract

We propose a formalism for extracting molecular Hamiltonian structure from inversion
of time-dependent ﬂuorescence intensity data. The proposed method requires a minimum of
a priori knowledge about the system and allows for extracting a complete set of information
about the Hamiltonian for a pair of molecular electronic surfaces.

1

Introduction

A long standing objective is the extraction of molecular Hamiltonian information from laboratory
data. The traditional approaches to this problem attempt to make use of time-independent
(spectroscopic and scattering) data [1, 2, 3]. Another approach aims to use ultrafast temporal
data, with information on molecular potentials and dipole moments obtained for spatial regions
sampled by evolving wave packets. Research in this direction has been especially intense during
the last few years [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. This activity is inspired by recent progress in the technology
of ultrafast laser pulses [10, 11], which makes possible observations of molecular dynamics with
increasingly higher spatial and temporal resolution.

Due to the diﬃculty of the Hamiltonian inversion problem, it is common to assume that
some a priori knowledge of the system is available. For example, one technique [6] proposes
to extract time-evolving wave functions and excited-state potentials using time-resolved and
frequency-resolved ﬂuorescence data and knowledge of the ground-state potential, the transition
frequencies, and the transition dipole moment. The inverse tracking method [7], proposed
for recovering the potential energy and dipole moment of a molecular electronic surface by
monitoring the temporal evolution of wave packets, explicitly assumes knowledge of the initial
excited wave functions. Clearly, such assumptions impair self-consistency and at least partially
undermine the inversion objectives. Although the desire to simplify the inversion algorithm
by making a priori assumptions about what is known and unknown is understandable, it has
remained an open question about whether these assumptions are actually necessary.

This letter addresses the latter point by proposing an inversion formalism that makes use of
minimal a priori knowledge about the system. The formalism is designed to operate between
two electronic surfaces, with electronic and vibrational transitions driven by two fast laser pulses,
which allows for extracting the potential energies and dipole moments for both surfaces as well
as the electronic transition dipole moment. The extraction is based on the inversion of the
time-dependent ﬂuorescence intensity data obtained from the detection of spontaneous emission
in transitions between the electronic surfaces. The proposed formalism lays the ground work
for extracting a complete set of information about a pair of electronic surfaces in a closed way,
with a minimum of a priori assumptions about the molecular Hamiltonian. This letter presents

1

the conceptual foundation of this novel approach, and a detailed numerical algorithm with
simulations will be presented elsewhere.

2 The physical picture

Consider the ground and excited electronic molecular surfaces with potential energies Vg(x) and
Ve(x) and dipole moments µg(x) and µe(x), respectively. The dipole moment for the electronic
transition between the two surfaces is M (x). For the sake of conceptual clarity, we consider a
one-dimensional problem; the generalization for the multidimensional case is straightforward.

The setup includes two time-dependent locked laser ﬁelds: ǫ0(t) drives transitions between
the two electronic surfaces (the carrier frequency of this laser will be typically in the visible or
ultraviolet part of the spectrum), and ǫ1(t) drives transitions between vibrational levels within
each of the two surfaces (the carrier frequency of this laser will be typically in the infrared).
The role of the driving ﬁelds is to excite the molecular wave packet and guide its motion on
the surfaces. It is physically reasonable that the potentials and dipole moments may be reliably
extracted only in the region sampled by the evolving wave packet. We assume that interactions
with other electronic surfaces and incoherent processes (e.g., thermal excitation and collisional
relaxation) are negligible. Ultrafast laser technology has made great advances recently, but
preparation of the infrared pulse of a desired shape is still a challenging technical problem. We
will consider the general situation, with two locked driving ﬁelds and ﬁve unknown functions
(two potentials and three dipole moments), but taking ǫ1 = 0 the problem is easily reduced to
a simpler one, with only one driving ﬁeld ǫ0 and three unknown functions (Vg, Ve and M ).

The Hamiltonian of the system in the Born-Oppenheimer, electric-dipole and rotating-wave

approximations takes the form:

H = Hg(x, p, t)σgg + He(x, p, t)σee − M (x)ǫ0(t)(σeg + σge),

(1)

where σij = |iihj| (with i, j = g, e) are transition-projection operators for the electronic states
|gi and |ei. Here, x and p are the canonical position and momentum for the vibrational degree
of freedom, Hg and He are the vibrational Hamiltonians in the ground and excited electronic
states,

Hi(x, p, t) = T + Vi(x) − µi(x)ǫ1(t),

i = e, g,

(2)

and T = p2/2m is the kinetic energy of the vibrational motion.

We assume that the initial state of the system is |Ψ(0)i = |u0i|gi, where u0(x) is the
vibrational ground state localized in the known harmonic part of the potential Vg(x). The
state of the system at any time t will be of the form

|Ψ(t)i = |u(t)i|gi + |v(t)i|ei,

(3)

with the normalization condition R dx(cid:0)|u(x, t)|2 + |v(x, t)|2(cid:1) = 1. The Schr¨odinger equation,

i∂t|Ψ(t)i = H|Ψ(t)i, then takes the form

The radiation emitted spontaneously by the molecule via transitions between the excited and
ground electronic surfaces contains information about the wave packet. This fact has been used
to reconstruct unknown vibrational wave packets in the method of emission tomography [13].
Our aim is diﬀerent: we assume that the initial state of the system is known and want to extract
the unknown potentials (Vg and Ve) and dipole moments (µg, µe, and M ) from information
contained in the time-dependent ﬂuorescence. We choose the time-dependent intensity of the
emitted radiation, I(t), as the observable. This intensity is I(t) = E(+)(t)E(−)(t), where E(+)(t)
is the negative-frequency part of the electric ﬁeld operator of the emitted radiation. E(+) is
proportional to M σeg, so the measured quantity is

hI(t)i = κhΨ(t)|M 2σee|Ψ(t)i.

(6)

where κ is a proportionality constant.

3 Extraction of the Hamiltonian structure

The physical picture above leads to the the following mathematical problem: extract the po-
tentials and dipole moments from the measured intensity hI(t)i, assuming that the initial state
and the two driving ﬁelds are known (note that a number of advanced experimental techniques
have been recently developed for characterization of ultrashort optical pulses [14, 15, 16]).

We start from the Heisenberg equation of motion, idI/dt = [I, H], to obtain

Using form (3) of the wave function, we rewrite (7) as an integral equation for M (x):

Z dx[M 2(x)F (x, t) + M 3(x)G(x, t)] =

In order to obtain equations for the other unknown functions (two potentials and two dipole
moments), we consider the second time derivative of hI(t)i. Then, using (3), we derive the

It is convenient to formally enumerate the unknown functions,

f1(x) = Vg(x),

f2(x) = Ve(x),

f3(x) = d0µg(x),

f4(x) = d0µe(x),

(14)

where d0 = 1 V/m, so all the functions fr(x) have the dimension of energy. Then the integral
equation (10) takes the form

and ˜ǫ1 = d−1

It is important to emphasize that in fact equations (8) and (15) represent an inﬁnite number
(or, in practice, a large number) of equations corresponding to diﬀerent times. We will use this
fact in the regularization procedure below. Of course, equation (15) is nonlinear because the
wave function depends on the potentials and dipole moments. Similarly, a solution M of (8)
depends on the wave function and thereby depends on other unknown functions. Consequently,
the problem at hand, including the integral equations and the Schr¨odinger equation, is highly
nonlinear. More importantly, the solution for such a system of integral equations is generally not
unique and the problem is ill-posed (i.e., the solution is not stable against small changes of the
data). These characteristics are common to virtually all inverse problems and arise because the
data used for the inversion are inevitably incomplete. Consequently, we need to regularize the
problem by imposing physically motivated constraints on the unknown functions. For example,
we may use the fact that physically acceptable potentials and dipoles should be smooth functions
and tend to zero asymptotically as x → ∞ (in the case of the dipole, the atoms are assumed to
separate as neutrals). By taking into account this information, some constraints are imposed on
the solutions, singling out the functions with desirable physical properties. This regularization
procedure will stabilize the solution.

The regularized solution of equation (15) is achieved by minimizing the functional

r (x).

(19)

Here, αr are standard regularization parameters which denote the tradeoﬀ between reproducing
the laboratory data and obtaining the solution with smooth and regular functions. The time

4

integration in (19) has a simple physical meaning: the measured intensity brings in information
about the potentials and dipoles at each instance of time and we want to use all the laboratory
information which has been accumulated during the period from time zero until t. The choice of
the functional (19) is not unique, and other forms of regularization may be considered as well.
Taking the variation of the functional J with respect to the unknown functions fr(x) involves
a subtlety related to the nonlinearity of the problem: the kernels Kr and the free term g depend
on the wave function and on M (x) and thereby depend on fr(x). The practical (numerical)
solution of any nonlinear problem includes some kind of linearization. Here, the point at which
we make the linearization is determined in the regularization procedure. We choose to take the
variation of the functional J in equation (19) only with respect to the explicit dependence on
fr(x). Then we obtain the set of regularized equations:

dt′Kp(x, t′)g(t′).

(20)

(21)

(22)

With p, r = 1, 2, 3, 4, we have the system of four integral equations with four unknown functions
(two potentials and two moments).

Now we want to regularize equation (8) for the electronic transition dipole M . This equation
is highly nonlinear: in addition to the dependence on M in the wave function, it also involves
second and third powers of M . Once again, we may choose at which point to make the lineariza-
tion. We prefer to linearize at an early stage, in order to obtain an equation of a simple form.
Thus we deﬁne

FM (x, t) = M 2(x)F (x, t),

GM (x, t) = M 2(x)G(x, t),

and write the functional

JM =Z t

dt′(cid:20)Z dxM (x)GM (x, t′) +Z dxFM (x, t′) − gM (t′)(cid:21)2

+ αMZ dxM 2(x).

(23)

(24)

Here, gM (t)) is the right-hand side of equation (8). The regularized solution of equation (8) is
achieved by minimizing this functional. And we choose the linearization procedure by taking
the variation of JM in equation (24) only with respect to the explicit dependence on M (that
is, we treat FM and GM as independent of M ). Then we obtain

Z dx′KM (x, x′, t)M (x′) + αM M (x) = gM (x, t),

where

KM (x, x′, t) =Z t
gM (x, t) =Z t

(27)

Finally, the integral equations (20) and (25) for the potentials and dipole moments and the
Schr¨odinger equations (4) and (5) for the components of the wave function form the full set of
coupled equations for the unknown functions, with hI(t)i, ǫ0(t), and ǫ1(t) as input data.

We conclude the presentation of the formalism with a schematic outline of the inversion
algorithm which will be numerically implemented in a forthcoming work. First, the algorithm
will start with trial functions for the potentials and dipoles to propagate the wave function from
t = 0 to t = ∆t. Using trial functions at the ﬁrst step is not an excessive demand for two
reasons: (i) For a suﬃciently small time increment ∆t, the evolution of the wave function is
mainly aﬀected by the values of the potentials and dipoles in the region where u0(x) is localized,
i.e., in the harmonic region of the ground potential surface; such information is usually known
with reasonable accuracy. (ii) As more data becomes available, the initial trial functions will
be replaced by those which match the measured ﬂuorescence intensity. The second step will
use the measured ﬂuorescence intensity, the wave function components u(∆t) and v(∆t), and
the initial trial functions for solving equations (25) and (20) to obtain the next evaluation of
the potentials and dipoles. These functions will be once again substituted into the Schr¨odinger
equation to propagate the wave packet from t = ∆t to t = 2∆t. The procedure will be repeated
many times with new laboratory data incorporated at each time step. The recorded ﬂuorescence
intensity, hI(t)i, contains information about the potentials and dipoles in the region where the
wave packet is localized at moment t as well as where it was prior to that time. The sequential
marching forward in time over the data track acts to reﬁne the potentials and dipoles at each
time step.

4 Discussion

This letter sets forth the formalism of a novel comprehensive approach to the inversion of
molecular dynamics from time-dependent laboratory data. One of the main features of the
proposed inversion method is initiation in the well-known ground state and use of external
driving ﬁelds to excite the wave packet and guide its motion on the ground and excited potential
surfaces. Diﬀerent driving ﬁelds will induce diﬀerent dynamics and may be more or less helpful
for the inversion procedure. Consequently, we are left with the attractive prospect of choosing
the driving ﬁelds to be optimally suited for assisting the extraction of unknown potentials and
dipoles from laboratory data. This choice may be facilitated by a closed learning loop [17] in the
laboratory, starting with a number of diﬀerent trial ﬁelds. According to the inversion objectives,
a learning algorithm will determine the best candidates and direct the ﬁelds to shapes which
are best suited to produce these objectives. Natural objectives are to maximize the spatial
region where the potentials and dipoles are reliably extracted. Physical intuition suggests that
one may learn more about the Hamiltonian at a speciﬁc spatial point if the wave packet is not
spread over the whole potential surface but is essentially localized in a narrow region around this
point. Consequently, the driving ﬁelds best suited for the inversion will control the dispersion of
the wave packet and guide its motion in a desired large spatial region. A numerical simulation
of the algorithm, including its closed-loop learning features, will be the next step towards its
laboratory implementation.

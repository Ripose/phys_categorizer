Free electron approximation for electron states in poly(p-phenylene vinylene) and other conjugated
systems is developed. It provides simple and clear analytical expressions for energies of electron
states and for wave functions. The results are in quantitative agreement with experiments. Our
model does not contain ﬁtting parameters. We present two examples of the developed theory
applications: exact calculation of electron energy in magnetic ﬁeld, and scattering of electrons in
copolymer.

Summary.

I. INTRODUCTION

The valence eﬀective Hamiltonian method is used for
many years as a theoretical basis for band structure cal-
culation of conjugated polymers, see Ref. 2 and litera-
ture cited therein. However, very simple approximate
calculations can be performed in framework of intro-
duced by Schmidt3 free electron model, see more ref-
erences in book of Salem4. This method is useful for
classiﬁcation of states of one-dimensional chain molecules
and aromatic molecules. In the latter case it is known
as Platt’s Perimeter Model5 or Perimeter Free Electron
Orbital Theory(PFEO)6. However, the arylene based
polymers, like poly(p-phenylene vinylene) (PPV), are not
purely one-dimensional, because they contain branching
points. The generalization of free electron approach to
this case is the main purpose of the present work. For the
ﬁrst time such calculations were undertaken by Rueden-
berg and Scherr1 and here we develop the free electron
network model starting with symmetry arguments.

We also would like to consider the basic question why
there exists signiﬁcant diﬀerence in characteristic energy

scales of polyacetylene and PPV π-electron bands struc-
ture. The answer was given in the work of Soos et al7. In
the cited work authors addressed the small energy scale
of the band structure of PPV to the presence of phenyl
rings. The bands of PPV are formed from the levels of
isolated phenyl ring (benzene molecule). The band width
is determined by the coupling between the rings, which
can be obtained by the canonical transformation from
the coupling between adjacent carbon atoms.

In the present work we calculated the structure of PPV

our model the proposed in Ref. 7 topological gap is the
consequence of the time-reversion symmetry of the wave
function near the triple nodes. Triple node is carbon
atom bound to three other carbons. Therefore, the struc-
ture of π-bands of PPV is determined by the phases ac-
cumulated by the wave function having passed from one
triple node to another. Polymer deformations become
unimportant in this model. However, the proposed here
model is suitable only for organic structures build from
conjugated carbon chains. Other kinds of organic struc-
tures cannot be described by this model.

We obtained PPV π-electrons wave functions in sim-
ple analytical form and their symmetry properties are
explicitly seen. For example, all four direct light absorp-
tion processes between two highest occupied bands and
two lowest empty bands are dipole allowed7. We obtained
a good agreement between theoretical prediction for the
HOMO–LUMO energy gap and experimentally measured
value 2.37eV. Our result for this energy gap is built from
fundamental constants and phenyl ring perimeter L:

experimentally8,9 absorption bands cannot be calculated
accurately from this model, because the electron states
near the top of the conduction band are in resonance with
periodic potential of carbon atoms chains, see discussion
of this problem below. In order to ﬁnd experimental sup-
port for our model we performed similar calculations for
poly(1,4-naphthalene vinylene)(PNV) and obtained cor-
rect value of its HOMO-LUMO energy gap.

One can note that correct value of the PPV energy
gap is obtained for the unbound excitations, i.e. possi-
ble eﬀects of electron-electron10,11 and electron-phonon12
interactions are not taken in to account. It is known con-
cerning PPV, that such eﬀects are important for calcula-
tion of absorption spectrum in the whole interval 0-7eV,
see cited above works. Our results indicate that excitonic
and polaronic eﬀects are not important for the absorption
near the energy gap.

Eﬀect of magnetic ﬁeld can be taken in to account
exactly in framework of our model. Magnetic ﬁeld in-
duce currents in PPV phenyl rings and they give main
contribution into PPV diamagnetic susceptibility. It is
diﬀerent from the susceptibility of equivalent number of
isolated phenyl rings for two following reasons. The mag-
netic ﬁeld induced shifts of electron energies in PPV and
benzene are diﬀerent. Part of PPV extended states are
occupied by σ electrons, which make, therefore, signiﬁ-
cant contribution into the magnetic susceptibility.

In pure PPV one can distinguish occupied valence band
and empty conductance band. In order to obtain certain
concentration of free carriers, holes in the valence band
and electrons in conductance band, one can dope polymer
with impurities or create structural defects. Our model
can be used for calculation of electron and holes transmis-
sion probabilities through structural defects. Associated
with defects localized states are also described by our
theory. In this work we considered naphthalene molecule
inserted in PPV instead of phenyl ring. We found that
it reﬂects holes much stronger than electrons. This re-
sult could be useful for investigation of localization eﬀects
in copolymer. In pure PPV mobilities of electrons and
holes are almost the same. Small concentration of naph-
thalene will aﬀect signiﬁcantly hole mobility in the case
when mean free path along PPV chain is large enough.
The accurate mathematical formulation of our model
is done in next section. The energies and the wave func-
tions of the electron states are calculated too. Developed
method application to the calculation of the diamagnetic
susceptibility is given in Sec. III. An example of electron
scattering on monomer of a diﬀerent kind embedded into
polymer, is considered in Sec. IV. The results are sum-
marized in Sec. V.

states. In this approximation the local potential of the
atoms is ignored, and it’s assumed that electrons can
move freely around the molecule ring. The electron wave
function for such state is ψ = exp(ikr), where r is coor-
dinate along the circular ring, and k is the wave number.
The periodic boundary condition results in kL = 2πn,
where L is the perimeter of the ring that is approximately
8.3˚A. So this theory gives sequence of benzene π-electron
levels

The big surprise is that the results of the above model
are in good agreement with experiment in spite of ben-
zene molecule complex structure. For example, carbons
create periodic potential V (r) along benzene ring perime-
ter. The ﬁrst order correction to the energy of n-th state
due to the presence of this potential is given by its matrix
element
. This matrix element will be diﬀerent

from zero if the period of the potential is equal to half
the wave length of n-th state wave function. Since the
period of V (r) is L/6 and the n-th state wavelength is
L/n, matrix element
is not zero for the state

The main idea of this work is to extend the above ap-
proach to PPV, see Fig. 1, which can be considered as a
sequence of benzene molecules connected via short chain
of two additional carbons. In the framework of the con-
sidered model, electron runs along this short chain unless
it reaches the phenyl ring. Here electron has some proba-
bility to come into the ring or to go back. The same pic-

ture repeats itself near the exit from the phenyl ring. We
will obtain the valid state of PPV if electron wave func-
tion has the same amplitude after passing one monomer.
Therefore, each unit cell of the polymer is modeled by the
three bonds, as it is shown in Fig. 1, where the length of
each bond is L/2. The electron can go from one bond to
another at the nodes, which are marked by the open and
ﬁlled circles in Fig. 1. The nodes correspond to carbon
atoms bound to three other carbons.

Let’s imagine the free electron wave is propagating
along the bond. When the wave reaches the node the
wave has amplitude r to be reﬂected and amplitude t to
go to each remaining bond, see Fig. 2. The amplitudes
to go left or right will be the same if we assume that the
node has C3v symmetry and the electron is in the ground
state of the bond conﬁnement potential. More rigorously,
let’s introduce coordinates x, y, z along three bonds at-
tached to one node, black circle in Fig. 1, with origins
at the middle of the corresponding bond. The electron
wave functions in these bonds will be

Our purpose is now to ﬁnd the states in entire PPV.
Since the polymer is periodic structure, the electron wave
function is characterized be quantum number φ. When
electron pass one monomer, the wave function acquires
this additional phase. Let say that considered previously
two bonds, with coordinates y and z along them, join a
new node, blank circle in Fig. 1, and make a loop. If the
coordinate along third bond attached to this node is x′
then the wave function in this bond will be

Application of the transmission and reﬂection rules to
this node gives us three additional equations

Ae−ikL/4+iφ = rBeikL/4+iφ + tCeikL/4 + tEeikL/4 ,
De−ikL/4 = rCeikL/4 + tEeikL/4 + tBeikL/4+iφ ,
F e−ikL/4 = rEeikL/4 + tBeikL/4+iφ + tCeikL/4 . (9)

Aeikx + Be−ikx ,
Ceiky + De−iky ,
Eeikz + F e−ikz .

Each wave leaving the node has to be linear combination
of all the three waves coming in to this node,

Be−ikL/4 = rAeikL/4 + tDeikL/4 + tF eikL/4 ,
Ce−ikL/4 = rDeikL/4 + tF eikL/4 + tAeikL/4 ,
Ee−ikL/4 = rF eikL/4 + tAeikL/4 + tDeikL/4 ,

where phase kL/4 is acquired by electron having passed
from the middle of the bond to the node.

The amplitudes t and r are complex numbers deﬁned
by the properties of the node. These amplitudes are not
completely independent due to time reversion symmetry.
The simple calculation results in two conditions

Six equations, Eqs. (4,9), will be compatible if the ma-
trix determinant of their coeﬃcients is zero. This deter-
minant has a following form, as a function of quantum
number φ and energy, which is taken into account by

by Eq. (11c).

The comparison of the energy dispersions with numeric
results of Ref. 2 shows that θ and W are energy indepen-
dent and take the limit values: θ
8/9. These
numbers mean that electron does not acquire additional
phase after passing triple node, and transmission of triple
node is as good as it is allowed by time reversion sym-
metry. Therefore, θ and W take their limit values and
should not be considered as ﬁtting parameters. For these

The signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the calculated above
band structure and numeric simulations is seen for the
position of π6 band and for the dispersion of π5 band
near φ = 0. This region of energies lies near the point
kL = 6π. In this point half the wavelength of the free
electron is equal to the distance between nearest carbons.
Therefore the states with kL
6π strongly interact with
periodic potential of the carbon chains and the correction
to the position of π6 band can be of the order of 1 eV.

Obtained before π-bands are not lowest energy levels
given by Eqs. (11). There are four more levels under
π1-band. These bands are occupied by σ-electrons. The
calculations in Ref. 2 show the highest σ-bands in the gap
between π1 and π2 bands. Therefore, the occupation of
PPV free electron orbitals is diﬀerent from the benzene
molecule case, where two lowest free electron orbitals are
occupied. It is instructive to make the correspondence
between the benzene molecule and PPV π states7. PPV
valence band, π3 and π2 bands lie in the energy interval
corresponding to π < kL < 3π. Therefore, they originate
from benzene molecule e2u unoccupied states. PPV π1
band lies in the interval π < kL < 3π. Therefore, it orig-
inate from benzene molecule e1g occupied states. These
observations contradict the basic assumptions of Ref. 11.
The wave functions of all the considered above states
are given by the amplitudes A, B, C, D, E, F , which can
be calculated for given energy from Eqs. (4,9). For state
with two quantum numbers n, φ wave function can be
completely described by the following system of equa-

where the wave function is normalized on one particle

the quantities κ, γ, ξ and quantum number φ, n are deter-
mined by the free electron wave vector k, and therefore
all of them are function of energy, and vise versa. Equa-
tion 15g is not necessary, but introduced for convenience.
When γ is negative, the quantity ξ has imaginary part,
which is equal to iπ. Since dimensionless wave numbers

The system Eqs. (15) describes two states for each pair

that the bands are parabolic near the edges,

The second term in the right hand side of each Eq. (16)

with wave vector κ per monomer length. From Eq. (16a)
one can obtain the eﬀective mass of electrons and from
Eq. (16b) the eﬀective mass of holes. One can see that the
diﬀerence between the eﬀective masses of the electrons
and the holes is small (4.3%).

III. POLYMERS IN THE MAGNETIC FIELD

Let’s consider experiment in which polymers are pre-
pared in a two dimensional layer. All the phenyl rings
of the polymer will be also lying in the same plane. If
one applies magnetic ﬁeld perpendicular to that plane,
electron propagating around phenyl ring will acquire the
additional phase, Φ, which is equal to the magnetic ﬂux
via the ring divided by ¯hc/e. This additional phase can
be easy introduced into Eqs. (4,9), and the determinant
of the coeﬃcients matrix becomes

Again the equation Q = 0 gives the dispersion relation
for the electron states in the polymer. The states π3
and π6 are not aﬀected by the magnetic ﬁeld, this can
be explained by the properties of these states. In such
a state electron is not only localized in the phenyl ring,
it is localized in one of the parts of the ring2. Therefore
electron in such a state does not go around the phenyl
ring and does not know about the magnetic ﬁeld.

The electron energy in other π-states is periodic func-

Here γ(φ, Φ) > 0. The energy of π2 and π5 states de-
creases in weak magnetic ﬁeld (paramagnetic states) and
the energy of π1 and π4 states increases (diamagnetic
states). For example, the energy gap between the con-
duction and the valence bands decreases with magnetic
ﬁeld, but the change is very small, since the area of the

of the self crossing the electron states can get additional
magnetic moment that depends on the tunneling proba-
bilities at such points. The magnetic moment of π-states
without considering of this eﬀect can be obtained from
the derivatives of the energies with respect to magnetic
ﬁeld.

The total magnetic moment of the polymer is given by
the summation of the magnetic moments of all the occu-
pied states. The diamagnetic susceptibility of the layered
polymer material at zero temperature can obtained as a
second derivative of the total energy of the system with
respect to magnetic ﬁeld. The approximate expression

susceptibility per electron15, χ0 = S2e2/(mc2L2). Nu-
meric integration with respect to φ gives χ
0.7N χ0.
Assuming that all PPV delocalized levels in the interval
0 < kL < 5π are occupied by 6 π electrons and 4 σ
electrons one may expect magnetic susceptibility of PPV

experimental data in order to check this prediction.

IV. ELECTRON STATES IN COPOLYMERS.

The last example for the application of our almost
heuristic theory to the real physical problems is consid-
eration of what will happen if we replace one monomer
in a polymer by monomer of a diﬀerent kind. Let’s con-
sider the copoly(p-phenylene vinylene – 1,4-naphthalene
vinylene), which was used in recent experiments16. This
system can be obtained formally from PPV if one re-
places part of phenyl rings by naphthalene molecules. If
the naphthalene concentration is small, we can consider
each monomer of 1,4-naphthalene vinylene as an impu-
rity or a structural defect in PPV chain. Therefore, such
monomer partially reﬂects electrons propagating in PPV
bands. In addition, we can ﬁnd “impurity” states asso-
ciated with such monomer. The purpose of this section
is to ﬁnd the wave functions of inﬁnite PPV with one
inserted 1,4-naphthalene vinylene monomer.

In order to be successive we will start with calculation
of states in pure poly(1,4-naphthalene vinylene)(PNV).
It is a more sophisticated conjugated system synthesized

well described by the PFEO model6. In other words π-
electrons move freely around naphthalene molecule, see
Fig. 4. In this model naphthalene molecule is replaced by
two bonds, one of them having length L/2 and another
having length 7L/6. Equations similar to Eqs. (4,9) can
be written for this model of PNV and from the condition

Now we can calculate wave functions in copolymer,
see Fig. 6a. Let’s calculate ﬁrst associated with inserted
naphthalene molecule “impurity” states. There are two
such states in each PPV energy forbidden band, one has
symmetric wave function and another has antisymmetric
wave function. These wave functions decay exponentially
with a distance, see Fig. 6b. We can obtain the energies
of these states by substituting wave functions with imag-
inary φ from Eqs. (15) to Eq. (25)

V. SUMMARY.

We have developed a new free electron model of PPV,
which allows to calculate band structure of polymer and
hold wave functions of π electrons in simple analytical
form. We showed that the band structure contains only
one parameter, which is the distance between two neigh-
boring carbons. The similar models can be developed
for other conjugated systems, for example, for graphite
planes or more complicated polymers. We have cal-
culated exactly the magnetic ﬁeld dependence of elec-
tron energies, which changes due to presence of phenyl
rings. The diamagnetic susceptibility per monomer of
PPV have been found approximately to be 8.76 of the
susceptibility of isolated benzene molecule. We consid-
ered scattering of electrons on polymer structural defects
and found interesting ﬁltering eﬀect in copolymer. The
naphthalene ring inserted in PPV chain instead of phenyl
ring reﬂects holes much better than electrons. The pro-
posed model is convenient for calculation of light absorp-
tion coeﬃcients, eﬀects of disorder, etc.

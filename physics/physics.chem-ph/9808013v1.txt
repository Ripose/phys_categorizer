Abstract. By judicious use of extrapolations to the 1-particle basis set
limit and n-particle calibration techniques, total atomization energies of
molecules with up to four heavy atoms can be obtained with calibration
accuracy (1 kJ/mol or better, on average) without any empirical correc-
tion. For the SCF energy a 3-point geometric extrapolation is the method
of choice. For the MP2 correlation energy, a 2-point A+B/(l+1/2)3 extrap-
olation is recommended, while for CCSD and CCSD(T) correlation energies
we prefer the 3-point A + B/(l + 1/2)C formula. Addition of high-exponent
‘inner polarization functions’ to second-row atoms is essential for reliable
results. For the highest accuracy, accounts are required of inner-shell corre-
lation, atomic spin-orbit splitting, anharmonicity in the zero-point energy,
and scalar relativistic eﬀects.

1. Introduction and statement of the problem

From an experimental point of view, the most fundamental thermochemical
property of a compound is its heat of formation in the gas phase. From a
theoretical point of view, it is the total atomization energy (TAE, ΣD0),
that is, the energy required to dissociate a ground-state molecule into its
constituent ground-state atoms in the gas phase. The two deﬁnitions, of
course, diﬀer merely by their choice of reference points for the constituent
elements.

The TAE of a molecule is one of the most diﬃcult properties, from
an ab initio perspective, to compute accurately. The use of homodesmic
and isodesmic reactions (as shown in the contribution of Irikura [1] in the
present volume) may greatly accelerate convergence of the computed result
with the level of theory, but obviously presupposes that accurate data are

already available for the related compounds occurring in the thermody-
namic cycle — a condition which is by no means always fulﬁlled.

The taxonomy of ab initio-based methods for theoretical thermochem-
istry (for molecular mechanics-based and semiempirical methods, see the
recent reviews of Allinger [2] and Thiel [3], respectively) can roughly be
presented as follows:

− empirical corrections

• additive corrections

∗ pair correction schemes such as G2 theory [4] and its variants

∗ connectivity-based schemes such as Martin’s 3-parameter cor-

[5]

rection (3PC) [6, 7]

∗ bond additivity corrections such as the BAC-MP4 scheme [8]
∗ atom equivalent schemes (see e.g. [1])

• multiplicative corrections

∗ the PCI-X schemes of Siegbahn and coworkers [9]
∗ the SAC (scaling all correlation) schemes [10]

− hybrid correction/extrapolation schemes: the CBS family of methods

[11, 12]

− ‘pure’ extrapolation methods

Classifying by accuracy and applicability range, PCI-X, SAC, BAC-
MP4, and similar schemes aim at near-chemical accuracy (2–5 kcal/mol)
for large systems — a goal also attainable, in many cases, through modern
density functional methods. [13,14] G2 theory, CBS-Q, and 3PC/spdf per-
mit chemical accuracy (about 1 kcal/mol), on average, for medium-sized
molecules. CBS-QCI/APNO and 3PC/spdf g permit mean absolute errors
near 0.5 kcal/mol, while 3PC/spdf gh permits 0.24 kcal/mol (1 kJ/mol)
accuracy.

The ﬁnal alternative however — which relies on no other information
than computed results for the molecule itself in a systematic sequence of
basis sets — can reach the highest accuracies of all, 0.12 kcal/mol (0.5
kJ/mol) on average. With the present state of computer technology, this
technique is limited to a system with about four heavy atoms, although
larger systems can be treated at some trade-oﬀ in accuracy. It forms the
subject of the present contribution.

Because this volume is primarily aimed at a readership of non-quantum
chemists, we will brieﬂy review some of the electronic structure methods
used in this paper. Further details can be found in the review articles cited
in the relevant sections.

2. Major Issues

2.1. TREATMENT OF DYNAMICAL CORRELATION

Our discussion of electron correlation methods will be restricted to single-
reference methods, i.e. methods for which the zero-order wave function
ψ0 is a single Slater determinant. We will in addition assume that the
Hartree-Fock orbitals have been expanded in a ﬁnite basis set of size N .
The Hartree-Fock equations then also have N solutions, of which the n
electrons in the system ﬁll the occupied orbitals (for which by convention
we will use indices i, j, k, . . .). The remaining solutions constitute the space
of virtual (unoccupied) orbitals, by convention denoted by indices a, b, c, . . ..
The exact wave function ψ can then be expanded as

ψ = ψ0 +

Ciaψi→a +

Cijabψij→ab + . . .

Xi>j,a>b
≡ (1 + ˆC1 + ˆC2 + . . . + ˆCn)ψ0

Xi,a

(1)

in which the ψi→a, ψij→ab, ψijk→abc, . . . are singly, doubly, and triply ex-
cited conﬁgurations and the C abc...
ijk... are termed conﬁguration interaction
(CI) coeﬃcients. (CI and related methods were very recently reviewed by
Shavitt [15], where references to older reviews can also be found.) Grouping
the latter by excitation level (i.e. the number of electrons moved from occu-
pied to virtual orbitals), we have also introduced the excitation operators
ˆCi (i=1, 2, 3, . . . ).

A calculation in which the complete expansion, eq. (1), is used is termed
an FCI (full conﬁguration interaction) calculation, and represents the exact
solution of the nonrelativistic clamped-nuclei Schr¨odinger equation within
the given ﬁnite basis set. Unfortunately the computational cost thereof in-
creases factorially with the size of the basis set and the number of electrons,
and becomes impractical for all but the fewest-electron systems in modest
basis sets. Where it can be done at all, even in a small basis set, it is an
invaluable gauge for the quality of more approximate electron correlation
methods.

An obvious approximation would be to truncate the FCI expansion
at a given ﬁnite excitation level. This leads to limited CI methods, with
truncation at (1 + ˆC1 + ˆC2) being known as CISD (CI with all single and
double excitations), (1 + ˆC1 + ˆC2 + ˆC3) as CISDT (single, double, and
triple excitations), and so forth. Unfortunately such methods are not size-
extensive [16], i.e. the computed energy does not scale properly with the size
of the system.1 This is a particularly severe disadvantage in thermochem-

1Size consistency [17], i.e. the property that limrAB→∞ EAB = EA + EB, in addition

requires correct dissociation behavior of the reference wave function.

istry since the inextensivity error on a typical association energy of two
medium-sized monomers A and B may well rival or exceed the interaction
energy itself.

An alternative route is to use ψ0 as the zero-order wave function in
a perturbation theoretical treatment, with the sum of the Fock operators
(of which ψ0 is an eigenfunction) as the zero-order Hamiltonian and the
diﬀerence with the true Hamiltonian as a small perturbation. Truncating
this expansion at low order yields the MPn (n-th order Møller-Plesset [18])
or MBPT-n (n-th order many-body perturbation theory) methods. They
can be rigorously proven [19] to be size extensive at all orders. The ﬁrst-
order correction is actually included in the Hartree-Fock energy (which is
why it diﬀers from the sum of the orbital energies, which is the zero-order
energy). The second-order correction is very easily and rapidly computed

E(2) =

| hij||abi |2
ǫi + ǫj − ǫa − ǫb

Xi>j,a>b

which explains both its popularity and its use for the basis set additivity
steps in G2 theory [5] and similar methods. Note that only double excita-
tions enter at second order, as is the case at third order. Single, triple, and
disconnected (see below) quadruple excitations enter the picture at fourth
order, connected quadruple excitations only at ﬁfth order, and the like [20].
Fifth- and even sixth-order methods have been implemented, but both al-
gebraic complexity and mounting computational expense make higher than
fourth orders progressively impractical (see e.g. [20–22]). The chief disad-
vantage of MPn methods is that, since orbital energy diﬀerences appear
in the denominators of the relevant energy expressions, convergence of the
MPn series is very slow in the presence of low-lying excited states.

The third, and most satisfactory, route to an approximate solution is to

replace eq. (1) by the equivalent “cluster expansion”

ψ = exp( ˆT1 + ˆT2 + ˆT3 + . . . + ˆTn)ψ0

ˆT1ψ0 ≡

tiaψi→a

Xi,a

Xi>j,a>b

tijabψij→ab

ˆT2ψ0 ≡

ˆT3ψ0 ≡

tijkabcψijk→abc

Xi>j>k,a>b>c

. . .

in which the ˆTm are known as cluster operators and the tij...ab... as cluster
amplitudes. This leads to a powerful method known as coupled cluster (CC)
theory. [23–27]

Obviously, a full CC expansion would not oﬀer any material advantage
over an FCI expansion. Truncated CC expansions however oﬀer two price-
less advantages over their CI counterparts: not only does the truncated CC
expansion converge vastly more rapidly than the truncated CI expansion,
but it is also rigorously size-extensive. (See e.g. [23, 25] for proofs.)

2 /2, ˆT 2

ˆT2/2, ˆT 4

The physical meaning of a CC expansion truncated at substitution or-
der m is that the wave function contains not only excitations up to order
m but also all higher excitations (up to and including n-fold), approxi-
mated by the (so-called “disconnected”) contribution from simultaneous
but statistically independent lower-order excitations of at most order m.
For instance, CCSD (coupled cluster with all single and double substitu-
tions, [28] i.e. ψ = exp( ˆT1 + ˆT2)ψ0) includes such “disconnected” quadruple
excitations ( ˆT 2
1 /24) as arise from simultaneous and indepen-
dent double excitations (starting at fourth order in MBPT) as well as those
from simultaneous but independent single, single, and double excitations
(starting at sixth order). In fact, CCSD contains such terms to inﬁnite or-
der in perturbation theory: what are missing are the “connected” quadruple
excitations (which start at ﬁfth order) as well as disconnected terms arising
from simultaneous single and (connected) triple excitations (also starting
at ﬁfth order). The CPU time requirement of CCSD, like that of CISD,
scales ∝ n2N 4, but it consistently recovers a high percentage of the exact
correlation energy for most systems. The next step up would be CCSDT
(coupled cluster with all single, double, and triple substitutions, [29] i.e.
ψ = exp( ˆT1 + ˆT2 + ˆT3)ψ0), which yields results exceedingly close to FCI but
has a CPU time scaling ∝ n3N 5. By comparison with perturbation the-
ory, we ﬁnd that the most important improvements over CCSD reside in
fourth- and ﬁfth-order terms involving ˆT3. By estimating these “quasiper-
turbatively” (i.e. using the corresponding perturbation theory expressions
but substituting the converged T1 and T2 amplitudes for the corresponding
terms in the second- and ﬁrst-order MBPT wavefunctions) we obtain the
very popular CCSD(T) method [30] which only has a ∝ n3N 4 operation
count (for the ﬁnal (T) step) but yields results almost identical to CCSDT
for systems where ψ0 is a good zero-order approximation [31].

The QCISD and QCISD(T) methods [32], which occur in G2 theory,
were originally developed as a new correlation method (“quadratic conﬁgu-
ration interaction”) but can be derived by omitting certain terms nonlinear
in ˆT1 from the CCSD and CCSD(T) methods, respectively (see pp.179–181
of [24] for discussion and further references).

Finally, it should be pointed out that CCSD(T) energies for open-shell
systems slightly diﬀer depending on whether an unrestricted [30] or a re-
stricted open-shell [33, 34] reference was used, and in the latter case, on
which deﬁnition for the open-shell (T) correction was used (that of Scuse-

6

JAN M.L. MARTIN

ria [33] or that of the Bartlett group [34]). Diﬀerences between the two
latter deﬁnitions are on the order of 0.1 kcal/mol or less [35], but when
considering very small diﬀerences between computed data from diﬀerent
sources, care should be taken to ensure consistency.

2.2. STATIC CORRELATION AND QUALITY OF THE ZERO-ORDER
REFERENCE

Aside from FCI which, as an exact solution, is unaﬀected by the quality
of ψ0, all of the methods discussed above presuppose that ψ0 is a good
zero-order approximation. Deviation from this regime (i.e. the presence of
low-lying excited states, which leads to a situation in which one or more
excited determinants have large coeﬃcients in ψ) is known as static or
nondynamical correlation.

The quality of all nonexact single-reference electron correlation treat-
ments is to a greater or lesser extent aﬀected by nondynamical correlation.
Hence some form of measuring its importance is essential in practical cal-
culations.

One quantitative measure for the importance of static correlation is the

T1 diagnostic of Lee and Taylor [36], deﬁned in the closed-shell case as

T1 =

ia t2
ia
N

(7)

s P
where N is the number of electrons being correlated. (In the open-shell case,
some double-counting needs to be avoided: see Ref. [37] for details.) MPn,
as noted before, is the most sensitive to static correlation: experience has
taught [26] that MP2 results are essentially unusable for T1 values as low as
0.02. CCSD(T), by contrast, will produce acceptable results for T1 values as
high as 0.055, while QCISD(T) breaks down for somewhat lower values of
T1 due to the omission of the higher-order terms in ˆT1. [38] CCSDT is amaz-
ingly robust, yielding reliable results for, e.g., the X 1Σ+ state of BN [39],
for which T1=0.08 and the low-lying excited state . . . (3σ)2(4σ)0(1π)4(5σ)2
contributes about 30% to the wave function. Systems with even stronger
static correlation (e.g. the Cr2 molecule [40]) demand the use of multiref-
erence methods, which are beyond the scope of this discussion.

Occasionally a problem may ‘slip by’ a T1 test. For instance, the lowest
g state of linear BNB+ is almost perfectly biconﬁgurational, despite
1Σ+
a deceptively low T1=0.040. While the latter value does indicate strong
static correlation, one might erroneously be led into believing CCSD(T)
to be still applicable for this system. An alternative, but less quantitative,
criterion is inspection of the most important excited conﬁgurations in the
converged wavefunction: yet another possibility is obtaining natural orbitals

AB INITIO THERMOCHEMISTRY BEYOND CHEMICAL ACCURACY 7

from a small basis set CISD or CASSCF (complete active space SCF [41],
a multireference method) calculation and inspecting the natural orbital
occupations.

A related problem which should be mentioned here is symmetry break-
ing. This occurs when at geometries slightly distorted from a symmetric
structure there exists a strong near-degeneracy interaction, but the two
partners of the interaction correlate to (nearly degenerate) states of dif-
ferent symmetry at the high-symmetry geometry. Both T1 and the SCF
energy then change drastically upon near-inﬁnitesimal displacements from
the symmetric structure, and the potential energy surface may exhibit a
discontinuity. This eﬀect may be real (in which case it is known as pseudo-
Jahn-Teller eﬀect [42]) or artifactual — in which latter case even very so-
phisticated electron correlation methods based on a single-determinant SCF
reference often fail. Aside from multireference methods, the use of Brueck-
ner orbitals [43] as the zero-order reference — leading to the BD [44],
BD(T) [45], and BDT [46] methods — often resolves symmetry break-
ing(e.g. [47–49]). Brueckner orbitals are deﬁned as those for which all T1
amplitudes are identically zero, and can be alternatively viewed as consti-
tuting the single-determinant wave function which has the greatest overlap
with the FCI wave function [50]. These orbitals and the BD or BDT ampli-
tudes are determined simultaneously in an iterative process which will take
substantially longer than a CCSD or CCSD(T) calculation, although it has
the same CPU time scaling behavior. In the absence of symmetry breaking,
BD(T) does not appear to oﬀer signiﬁcant advantages over CCSD(T) [51].

2.3. 1-PARTICLE CALIBRATION: QUALITY OF THE FINITE BASIS SET

Perhaps the most recent and comprehensive review of basis sets is that by
Helgaker and Taylor [52]. We will only mention a few salient points for the
present application here.

For an atomic calculation at the SCF level, a basis set can be of ‘min-
imal’ quality and still recover essentially the exact SCF energy, as long
as the individual functions closely mimic true Hartree-Fock orbitals. In a
molecular calculation, ﬂexibility is required — which requires splitting up
the valence functions — as well as the ability to accommodate polarization
of the atomic charge cloud in the molecular environment, which is done
by adding higher angular momentum (d, f, . . .) basis functions (so-called
polarization functions). Nevertheless, the basis set convergence of the SCF
energy is fairly rapid compared to the correlation energy.

In a correlated calculation on an atom, the basis set must accommodate
two important kinds of dynamical correlation eﬀects. The ﬁrst, radial cor-
relation (or “in-out correlation”), involves the tendency of one electron to

8

JAN M.L. MARTIN

be near the nucleus when the other is near the periphery, or conversely. It
is accommodated by permitting basis functions with extra radial nodes to
mix into the wave function, i.e. by uncontracting s and p functions.

The second, angular correlation (or left-right correlation), involves the
tendency of one electron to be on a diﬀerent side of the atom as the other.
This is accommodated by permitting basis functions with extra angular
nodes to mix into the wave function, i.e. by adding d, f, g, . . . functions.
The convergence of this eﬀect in particular is quite slow.

Note that except for the special cases of hydrogen and the alkali met-
als, the basis set extensions required for an adequate description of radial
and angular valence correlation will generally cover all the requirements
noted above for atomic SCF calculations, except for inner-shell polariza-
tion in second-row compounds (see next section). The guiding principle
for basis set development for high-level correlated calculations has there-
fore traditionally been that a molecular basis set should, at the very least,
accommodate all basis set eﬀects occuring in the isolated atom.

Both main families of such basis sets in usage are based on general con-
tractions [53], i.e. all primitive Gaussians can contribute to all contracted
functions.

The older of the two families are the atomic atomic natural orbital
(ANO) basis sets of Alml¨of and Taylor [54]. The starting point here are
natural orbitals obtained from an atomic CISD calculation in a very large
primitive basis set. The natural orbitals with the highest occupation num-
bers are then selected as basis functions. It was found that these always
occur in groups of almost equal occupation numbers: e.g., the ﬁrst f , sec-
ond d, and third p function have similar natural orbital occupations. This
systematically leads, for ﬁrst-row elements, to contractions like [4s3p2d1f ],
[5s4p3d2f 1g], [6s5p4d3f 2g1h], and so forth. (Corresponding contractions
for second-row elements are [5s4p2d1f ], [6s5p3d2f 1f ], [7s6p4d3f 2g1h], and
the like.)

The second family, the correlation consistent (cc) basis sets of Dun-
ning [55] and coworkers, is establishing itself as the de facto standard for
calibration calculations. Dunning subjected relatively compact atomic basis
sets to energy optimization, and considered the energy gain from adding
diﬀerent kinds of primitives. He then found that these energy contributions
likewise occur in groups: thus, the energy gain from adding the ﬁrst f ,
second d, or third p function is similar. Again this suggests adding them
in shells, which again leads to the same typical contraction patterns as for
their ANO counterparts. Based on the number of diﬀerent functions avail-
able for the valence orbitals, these basis sets are known as cc-pVnZ (corre-
lation consistent valence n-tuple zeta), where n=D for double (a [3s2p1d]
contraction), T for triple (a [4s3p2d1f] contraction), Q for quadruple (a

AB INITIO THERMOCHEMISTRY BEYOND CHEMICAL ACCURACY 9

[5s4p3d2f1g] contraction), and 5 for quintuple zeta (a [6s5p4d3f2g1h] con-
traction). For compactness, the present author and coworkers generally use
the notation VnZ.

Martin [56] carried out a detailed comparison of computed TAE values
with equivalent ANO and cc basis sets. The results were found to be nearly
identical, while the integral evaluation time for the cc basis sets was con-
siderably shorter due to their more compact primitive size. Therefore cc
basis sets are more commonly used, although for certain other applications
(like weak molecular interactions or electrical properties) ANO basis sets
and particularly the “averaged ANO” variant [57] may be preferable.

For the computation of electron aﬃnities and calculations on anions in
general, special low exponent s and p functions (so-called ‘soft’ or ‘diﬀuse’
functions) are required at the SCF level (e.g. [58]). At correlated levels,
the regular s and p functions are adequate as radial correlation functions
thereto, but angular correlation in the tail range requires the addition of
‘soft’ d, f , . . . functions. Kendall et al. [59] proposed the aug-cc-pVnZ ba-
sis sets (AVnZ for short), in which the cc-pVnZ basis set is ‘augmented’
with one ‘soft’ (or low-exponent) basis set of each angular momentum. It
was subsequently found (e.g. [60, 61]) that these functions are indispens-
able for calculating properties such as geometries and harmonic frequencies
of highly polar neutral molecules as well. It is also noteworthy [60] that
including just the soft s and p functions only recovers about half the eﬀect.
Del Bene [62] noted that, except in such compounds as LiH in which
hydrogen has a signiﬁcant negative partial charge, omission of the diﬀuse
functions on H generally does not aﬀect results. This practice is denoted
by the acronym aug′-cc-pVnZ (or A′VnZ for short).

Some authors (e.g. [63]) have obtained excellent results for the ﬁrst-
row hydrides using basis sets of only spdf quality, combined with sp bond
functions (i.e. basis functions centered around the bond midpoint). How-
ever, as the extension of bond function basis sets to multiple bonds will
require d bond functions, which in turn will require [64] atom basis sets
of up to spdf g quality to keep to keep down basis set superposition error
(BSSE, Sec. 3.4) to an acceptable level, the usefulness of bond functions
for our purpose appears to be somewhat limited. Bauschlicher and Par-
tridge [65] very recently compared basis set convergence between very large
atom-centered and bond function-augmented basis sets for eight covalently
bound diatomics. If the underlying atom-centered basis set is large enough
to eﬀectively suppress BSSE, then bond function augmented basis sets are
found not to oﬀer a material improvement over purely atom-centered sets
of similar size. For weakly bound systems (like rare gas dimers), however,
Tao [66] found greatly improved results upon addition of bond functions, a
ﬁnding corroborated by Partridge and Bauschlicher [67].

2.4. 1-PARTICLE CALIBRATION VERSUS N -PARTICLE TREATMENT

Situations may arise where the electron correlation method of choice simply
cannot be used in the largest basis set that would be preferable for an
extrapolation to the inﬁnite-basis limit. In that case, one may need to
select a less computationally demanding method and apply the additivity
approximation

E(Method2/Basis2) ≈ E(Method2/Basis1) + E(Method1/Basis2)
− E(Method1/Basis1)

(8)

This presupposes, of course, that only weak coupling exists between im-
provement of the n-particle treatment from Method1 to Method2 and en-
largement of the 1-particle basis set from Basis1 to Basis2. Needless to say,
how well this assumption holds will depend to a large extent on how diﬀer-
ent the methods and basis sets involved are, as well as on the system under
study. For instance, in a system with pronounced static correlation, using
MP2 to estimate basis set extension eﬀects in this manner may yield really
poor results.

Several levels of such approximations can be nested, e.g.

E(Method3/Basis3) ≈ E(Method3/Basis1)
+E(Method2/Basis2) − E(Method2/Basis1)
+E(Method1/Basis3) − E(Method1/Basis2)

(9)

For instance, in standard G2 theory one has Method1=MP2, Method2=MP4,
Method3=QCISD(T), and Basis1=6-311G**, Basis2=6-311+G(2df,p),
Basis3=6-311++G(3df,2pd). Below, for the atomic electron aﬃnities, we
will consider Method1=CCSD(T), Method2=CCSDT, Method3=FCI, and
Basis1=AVDZ, Basis2=AVQZ, Basis3=AV6Z.

Also, if the diﬀerence between basis sets A and B comprises two or more
sets of basis functions that do not overlap appreciably, and cover quite
diﬀerent eﬀects and/or regions of the wave function (e.g. diﬀuse functions
and core correlation functions), additivity approximations may be invoked.
For instance, if B is the set union of B1 and B2, both of which are supersets
of A, then

E(M/B) ≈ E(M/B1) + E(M/B2) − E(M/A)

(10)

E.g. with A=VnZ, B1=AVnZ, B2=VnZ+IPF (inner polarization functions,
Sec. 2.6), and B=AVnZ+IPF, this approximation was found [68] to hold
to 0.02 kcal/mol or better in CCSD(T) calculations on SO2.

AB INITIO THERMOCHEMISTRY BEYOND CHEMICAL ACCURACY 11

2.5. INNER-SHELL CORRELATION

Conventional wisdom would have it that core correlation eﬀects will not
be important for ﬁrst- and perhaps second-row compounds. The truth is a
little more complex.

In a systematic study [69] of inner-shell correlation eﬀects on atomiza-
tion energies of ﬁrst-row compounds, contributions as large as 2.44 kcal/mol
for C2H2, and 1.78 kcal/mol for CO2, were found. Clearly, one cannot aﬀord
to neglect such eﬀects even when striving for mere chemical accuracy.

The smaller gap between the inner-shell (2s, 2p) and valence (3s, 3p)
orbitals in second-row atoms would suggest that the eﬀects of inner-shell
correlation would be stronger, if anything, than in the case of ﬁrst-row
compounds. While this is certainly true in terms of the absolute correlation
energy (where (2s, 2p) correlation may meet or exceed the valence contri-
bution in importance), the diﬀerential contributions to the binding energy
tend to be quite modest, reaching some 0.77 kcal/mol for SO2 [68] and only
0.09 kcal/mol for H2SiO [70]. In fact, as found previously [71], contributions
to binding energies of silanes may actually be negative: e.g. -0.54 [71] or
-0.56 [70] kcal/mol in the case of triplet silylene. These contributions are
dwarfed by those from inner polarization (see below).

Explicit consideration of core correlation requires the use of special basis
sets that accommodate inner-shell correlation eﬀects by the addition of ex-
tra radial nodes in the s functions (in practice, uncontracting the innermost
s function a little will do the job) as well as ‘tight’ or ‘hard’ (high-exponent)
extra p and d functions. The two main alternatives for practical calculations
are the Dunning group cc-pCVnZ basis sets [72,73] (which are available for
B through F) and the Martin-Taylor core correlation basis sets [60], which
are available for Li through F and for Al through Cl. In the author’s ex-
perience for ﬁrst-row compounds, the Martin-Taylor basis set is of about
the same quality as the cc-pCVQZ basis set, while the cc-pCVTZ basis set
generally only recovers about 75–80% of the inner-shell correlation eﬀects.
Finally, it cannot be stressed enough that including core correlation
in basis sets not designed to handle core correlation (such as the regular
cc-pVnZ basis sets or the Pople basis sets [74], which are only minimal
in the core) will generally yield erratic core correlation contributions, and
therefore is simply a waste of CPU time. (All electronic structure programs
presently allow for correlated calculations with frozen core electrons.)

2.6. INNER POLARIZATION IN SECOND-ROW COMPOUNDS

In the course of studies (e.g., [68, 75]) on the computed geometry and vi-
brational frequencies (harmonic as well as anharmonic) of some second-row
compounds, it was found that basis set convergence was atypically slow.

JAN M.L. MARTIN

Adding a single high-exponent d function to the standard Dunning cc-
pVTZ basis set for S (which is of [5s4p2d1f ] quality) was found to aﬀect
the geometry in SO2 by as much as 0.013 ˚A and 1 degree, and the har-
monic frequencies by as much as 34 cm−1. (Similar eﬀects are seen [76] in
SO3.) The addition of such a function is denoted by the “+1” suﬃx, as
in VTZ+1. Likewise, the computed total atomization energy at this level
is aﬀected by as much as 8 kcal/mol, an observation previously made by
Bauschlicher and Partridge [77] and, in passing, in the paper [78] on the
extension of G1 theory [79] (a predecessor of G2 theory) to second-row
compounds. Refs. [77, 78] both ascribed the phenomenon to hypervalence
but, while this may play a role in the case of SO2, it cannot account for
the same phenomenon occurring in SO [68], SiO [75], and AlF [75], none of
which are hypervalent by any reasonable deﬁnition. The fact that a clear
correlation exists [75] between the polarity of the bonds and the magnitude
of the eﬀect supports an explanation in terms of core polarization [80];
the fact that the bulk of the eﬀect is seen at the SCF level (as well as in
density functional calculations for energetics [77], geometries [76] and har-
monic frequencies [76]) is consistent with both explanations. Comparison
of the orbitals and orbital energies from SCF/VTZ and SCF/VTZ+1 cal-
culations on SO2 revealed that while the tight d function only contributes
to the highest occupied valence orbitals, the only orbital energies seriously
aﬀected are those of the (2s, 2p) like orbitals on sulfur.

Inner-shell polarization is usually adequately accommodated by the ad-
dition of a single tight d function. The optimum values at the SCF level for
molecules were found [75] to be surprisingly close to those of the tightest d
exponent in the Dunning cc-pV5Z basis set, which were therefore taken as
the recommended values. In cases where the eﬀect is strong, we recommend
the use of even-tempered sequences αβn with α the tighest exponent in the
underlying basis set and β=2.5 or 3.0. Such basis sets we denote VTZ+1d,
VQZ+2d1f, and the like.

It should be noted that since this eﬀect is not at all present in the
separated atoms, it forms an apparent exception to the “what is good for
correlated atomic calculations will do for molecular ones” rule that generally
guides basis set development. This holds true if only valence correlation is
considered: basis sets augmented for (2s, 2p) inner-shell correlation (such
as the Martin-Taylor basis set [60]) however amply provide for inner-shell
polarization, such that the above rule prevails in a wider sense.

Inﬁnite-basis extrapolations from a VnZ or AVnZ series tend to give
grossly exaggerated binding energies when inner polarization is involved,
because the d and f functions progressively intrude into the ‘inner po-
larization’ region as n increases. The remedy obviously consists of adding
inner polarization functions — this should be done in a ‘balanced’ way

AB INITIO THERMOCHEMISTRY BEYOND CHEMICAL ACCURACY 13

since for the lower terms of the VnZ series, the inner polarization func-
tions span the same region as the tightest d and f exponents in the higher
terms of the VnZ series. The present author favors the sequence VTZ+1d,
VQZ+2d1f, V5Z+3d2f1g, while Bauschlicher and Ricca [81] suggest the
sequence VnZ+2d.

3. Secondary Issues

3.1. QUALITY OF THE ZERO-POINT ENERGY

Aside from the issue of the accuracy of the vibrational frequencies used
in the zero-point energy, one also has to contend with the eﬀect of anhar-
monicity. We will illustrate our remarks for the case of asymmetric tops,
but the conclusions are valid in general.

Correct to second order in rotation-vibration perturbation theory [82],

the zero-point energy of an asymmetric top is given by

ZPE = E0 +

ωi +

Xij

(11)

Xi
in which the ωi and Xij are the harmonic frequencies and ﬁrst anharmonic-
ity constants, respectively, and the E0 term [83] is usually very small.

Xi≥j

Two common approximations to eq.(11) are one-half the sum of the
harmonic frequencies, and one-half the sum of the vibrational fundamentals.
These approximation err on the top and bottom side, respectively: the
errors (assuming no strong Fermi resonances are present) are

The larger the molecule becomes, the larger these deviations will grow,
especially with molecules containing X–H bonds (which have strongly an-
harmonic stretching frequencies). The usual practice (as used, e.g., in G2
theory) of estimating the zero-point energy by scaling relatively low-level
computed harmonic frequencies by a factor intended to approximate ob-
served fundamentals (e.g., 0.89 for HF/6-31G* frequencies [84]) is therefore
not appropriate, as ﬁrst suggested by Grev et al. [85]. (For a sample of 14
small molecules where the exact ZPE values are known, this procedure was
found [7] to result in mean and maximum absolute errors of 0.26 and 0.72
kcal/mol, respectively.) Scott and Radom [86] (see also Ref. [87]) propose
diﬀerent scale factors for frequencies and zero-point energies for a variety
of density functional and conventional ab initio methods.

14

JAN M.L. MARTIN

For diatomics and some small polyatomic molecules, experimentally de-
rived sets of anharmonicity constants may be available, and are the method
of choice for determining zero-point energies. We follow this approach in
our highest accuracy work whenever possible (e.g. [68,88–90]). For yet oth-
ers, accurate anharmonic zero-point energies are available as by-products
of ab initio anharmonic force ﬁeld studies (e.g. [68,70,91–94] and references
therein) — at the levels of theory used in such studies, zero-point energies
generally are converged to 0.1 kcal/mol or better.

One additional alternative, if both computed ωi and observed νi are

available, would be to take the average of

i ωi/2 and

i νi/2:

ZPE −

and either estimate the diagonal stretching anharmonicities among the Xii
(which will be the largest) from data [95] for the corresponding diatomics
or neglect that term altogether.

3.2. QUALITY OF THE REFERENCE GEOMETRY

As pointed out in, e.g., Ref. [7], the leading quadratic dependence of the
total energy on displacements from the equilibrium geometry ensures that
computed thermochemical properties are fairly insensitive to errors in the
reference geometry on the order of 0.01 ˚A or less. Some commonly used
levels of theory for reference geometries may however lead to much larger
errors or even qualitatively incorrect geometries: at a result, an MP2/6-
31G* reference geometry for N2O will cause an error of 1.8 kcal/mol in the
CCSD(T)/cc-pVTZ atomization energy. [7]

A particularly good compromise between accuracy and computational
cost is oﬀered by the B3LYP [13,96]density functional method, particularly
with a cc-pVTZ or better basis set. (Average errors in bond distances at the
B3LYP/cc-pVTZ level are on the order of 0.003 ˚A for ﬁrst-row compounds.
[97]) For second-row atoms, the use of the cc-pVTZ+1 basis set (see above)
is desirable [76].

3.3. THERMAL CONTRIBUTIONS

Except for ﬂoppy molecules, thermal contributions at room temperature
can be quite accurately evaluated using the familiar rigid rotor-harmonic
oscillator (RRHO) approach. If data at high temperatures are required,
this approach is no longer suﬃcient, and an anharmonic force ﬁeld and
analysis, combined with a procedure for obtaining the rotation-vibration
partition function therefrom, are required. Two practical procedures have

AB INITIO THERMOCHEMISTRY BEYOND CHEMICAL ACCURACY 15

been proposed. The ﬁrst one, due to Martin and coworkers [98,99] is based
on asymptotic expansions for the nonrigid rotor partition function inside
an explicit loop over vibration. It yields excellent results in the medium
temperature range but suﬀers from vibrational level series collapse above
2000 K or more. A representative application (to FNO and ClNO) is found
in Ref. [61].

The second method, due to Topper and coworkers [100], is based on
Feynman path integrals, and works best in the high temperature limit.
Therefore the two methods are complementary.

3.4. BASIS SET SUPERPOSITION ERROR

When one carries out a calculation on the AB diatomic using a basis set for
A and B that is incomplete (as all ﬁnite basis sets by deﬁnition are), the
atomic energy of A in AB, and of B within AB, will be slightly overestimated
(in absolute value) due to the fact that the basis functions on the other atom
have become available. (It is easily veriﬁed that basis functions on B can
be expanded as a series of higher angular momentum functions around A.)
This phenomenon is known as basis set superposition error (BSSE). The
standard estimate is using the Boys-Bernardi [101] counterpoise method:

BSSE ≈ E[A(B)] + E[B(A)] − E[A] − E[B]

(15)

where E[A(B)] represents the energy of A with the basis set of B present
on a ‘ghost atom’, and conversely for E[B(A)].

While the counterpoise correction is commonly used as a correction term
for interaction energies in weak molecular complexes, virtually no authors
apply it to the calculation of total atomization energies, for the simple
reason that it invariably produces worse results. In addition, the extension
of the counterpoise correction to systems with more than two fragments is
not uniquely deﬁned [102–104].

The anomaly that neglecting BSSE would yield better results is only
an apparent one: after all, BSSE is a measure of basis set incompleteness
— which is precisely what we are trying to get rid of — but the correction
has the opposite sign. For suﬃciently large basis sets (say, of spdf g qual-
ity), the NASA Ames group actually found that 150% of the counterpoise
BSSE is a fair estimate of the remaining basis set incompleteness [105].
However, given the complications for systems larger than diatomics, the
present author prefers the use of extrapolation to the inﬁnite-basis limit
above such methods. (It goes without saying that the BSSE goes to zero
at the inﬁnite-basis set limit. Therefore, a suﬃciently reliable extrapolation
to the inﬁnite-basis set limits eﬀectively obviates the issue.)

16

JAN M.L. MARTIN

Very recently, there has been some indication [81] that inner shell cor-
relation contributions to TAE may exhibit (relatively speaking) quite sub-
stantial BSSEs unless very large basis sets are used.

3.5. RELATIVISTIC EFFECTS

A review of relativistic quantum chemistry is beyond the scope of this work:
the reader is referred to review articles by., e.g., Dyall [106], Pyykk¨o [107],
Sadlej [108]. We will restrict ourselves to introducing a popular approxima-
tion to relativistic eﬀects.

Upon expanding the Dirac-Fock Hamiltonian in powers of (v/c)2 (v/c
being the fraction of the speed of light that the electron attains), adding
the Breit retardation term, and discarding higher-order terms in (v/c)2,
one obtains [109] the Breit-Pauli Hamiltonian:

ˆH = ˆHN R −

(16)

Xi

Xi,A

Xi

in which V is the total one-electron potential, δ(~x) is a Dirac delta function,
ˆs and ˆp are spin and momentum operators, respectively, and two-electron
components of the third and fourth terms (which are much smaller than
the corresponding one-electron contributions) have been omitted.

The ﬁrst term is the nonrelativistic Hamiltonian. The second term,
known as the mass-velocity term, arises from the relativistic mass increase
of the electron m = me/(1 − (v/c)2) — in which me represents the electron
rest mass. (For the (1s) orbital of a hydrogen-like atom, hvi /c = Z/c.) The
third term, known as the Darwin term, arises because [109] in this approx-
imation, the electron is most appropriately described as a diﬀuse charge
distribution with dimensions on the order of α (α = 1/c = 137.037a0)
rather than a point charge — leading to reduced nuclear attraction and
electron-electron Coulomb repulsion. (The sum of these latter two terms is
often referred to as the ‘scalar relativistic’ contribution.) Finally, the fourth
term represents spin-orbit coupling.

Cowan and Griﬃn [110] suggested an approximate Hamiltonian consist-
ing of only ˆHN R and the mass-velocity and one-electron Darwin terms —
with spin-orbit splitting to be treated separately by perturbation theory
from the converged wave function. (This latter approximation is only jus-
tiﬁed if the spin-orbit splittings are much smaller in magnitude than the
electronic state splittings — as is the case for lighter atoms.)

3.5.1. Scalar relativistic contributions
Martin [111] (no relation to the present author) went one step further
and suggested the evaluation of the Darwin and mass-velocity terms by

AB INITIO THERMOCHEMISTRY BEYOND CHEMICAL ACCURACY 17

ﬁrst-order perturbation theory. Since this approach involves only the non-
relativistic wave function and expectation values of one-electron opera-
tors therefrom, these relativistic corrections can readily be obtained from
any converged nonrelativistic Hartree-Fock or correlated wave function for
which such expectation values can be evaluated, such as CISD or the aver-
aged coupled pair functional (ACPF) method [112].

Since the Darwin and mass-velocity (DMV) terms predominantly sam-
ple eﬀects near the atomic nuclei, the basis set for these types of calculations
should be ﬂexible in the high-exponent region. Since it seems to be obvious
that inner-shell correlation would be important, a core-correlation basis set,
if necessary uncontracted in the s and p primitives, appears to be the basis
set of choice.

Another technique that permits the incorporation of relativistic eﬀects
in an otherwise nonrelativistic computational framework is the use of rel-
ativistic eﬀective core potentials. [113, 114] While this may be the only
alternative for future accurate work on, say, ﬁrst-row transition metal and
heavy p-block compounds, this approach is generally not recommended for
ﬁrst-and second-row compounds.

The DMV corrections usually lead to a reduction in TAE, because on
average electrons are closer to the nucleus in the separated atom than in
the molecule. Inclusion of electron correlation usually appears to reduce the
size of the DMV terms. Since the eﬀect will be the largest for the innermost
electrons, it is usually recommended to correlate all electrons in calculations
of the DMV contributions.

How do perturbative DMV corrections compare with results from more
rigorous relativistic methods? Collins and Grev [115] found the relativistic
contribution to the binding energy of SiH4 to be −0.67 kcal/mol using rel-
ativistic (Douglas-Kroll [116]) CCSD(T) in a very large basis set. At the
ACPF level with the Martin-Taylor core correlation basis set [60], we obtain
−0.69 kcal/mol using 1st order Darwin and mass-velocity terms by pertur-
bation theory. Obviously, such excellent agreement cannot be automatically
assumed for fourth-row, let alone ﬁfth-row compounds.

3.5.2. Spin-orbit coupling
The ab initio evaluation of spin-orbit matrix elements was reviewed in detail
by Richards et al. [117] and recently by Heß et al. [118]. The most important
aspect for us, however — the atomic spin-orbit splitting and its eﬀect on
atomization energies — can be derived directly from experimental data.

In a nonrelativistic calculation, the spin-orbit component states of, for
instance, B(2P ), C(3P ), O(3P ), and F(2P ) are all degenerate, which of
course does not hold true in Nature. This means that any nonrelativis-
tic calculation involving atoms with L > 0 ground states will intrinsically

18

JAN M.L. MARTIN

overestimate binding energies. One possible workaround is to adjust the ex-
perimental binding energy to obtain “experimental nonrelativistic” (more
correctly: spin-orbit averaged) contribution. More elegantly the spin-orbit
correction can be added to the computed binding energy. For example, for
every oxygen or sulfur atom present, the computed TAE should be de-
creased by [E(3P0) + 3E(3P1) + 5E(3P2)]/9 − E(3P0), and for every ﬂuorine
or chlorine atom, by [2E(3P1/2) + 4E(3P3/2)]/6 − E(2P1/2) (The required
energy levels can be found in the JANAF tables [119] for the corresponding
atoms in the gas phase.) While these contributions are commonly neglected
in more approximate methods like G2 theory and CBS-4, one cannot do so
‘unpunished’ in a rigorous extrapolation calculation — some typical contri-
butions to TAE for chalcogenides and halogenides of the ﬁrst and second
row are 0.8 kcal/mol for F2, 0.6 kcal/mol for CO2, 1.0 kcal/mol for SO2,
and 1.2 kcal/mol for BF3. These contributions are clearly on the order of
the accuracy we are trying to achieve.

4. Extrapolation to the inﬁnite-basis limit

4.1. EXTRAPOLATION OF THE SCF ENERGY

Dunning observed, in his original landmark paper on correlation consistent
basis sets [55], that the energy gain from adding extra functions of a given
angular momentum, as well as that from adding the ﬁrst function of the
next higher angular momentum, roughly follow a geometric series.

Feller [120] then noted that total energies for molecules calculated with
successive cc-pVnZ basis set themselves roughly followed geometric series,
and suggested the use of an expression of the form

E(n) = E∞ + A exp(−Bn)

(17)

which is itself a special case of a geometric extrapolation based on A +
B.C −n.

Performance of the Feller exponential 3-point extrapolation for SCF
total energies cannot be described as other than impressive. Table 1 com-
pares extrapolated SCF total energies with values obtained from numerical
Hartree-Fock calculations. The largest discrepancy, for the BF diatomic,
amounts to 19 µEh, or 0.01 kcal/mol. A two-point A + B/(l + 1/2)5 for-
mula, following a suggestion in Ref. [124], works substantially less well.

Generally, the SCF component of atomization energies converges even
faster than these total energies, and extrapolations beyond cc-pV5Z or aug-
cc-pV5Z rarely contribute more than 0.01 kcal/mol or so.

4.2. EXTRAPOLATION OF THE VALENCE CORRELATION ENERGY

Feller originally proposed his formula as a general extrapolation for energies,
and in fact, in much of the earlier work of the Dunning group, this formula
was employed for extrapolation of the total CCSD(T) or MRCI energy.

The fact that the formula is largely phenomenological and has no phys-
ical basis would, from a pragmatic point of view, not be of serious concern
if it worked well. However, contrary to the SCF case, performance of the
geometric extrapolation for correlation energies leaves something to be de-
sired. Table 2 collects error statistics for the total atomization energies of
15 molecules for which they are very precisely (on the order of 0.1 kcal/mol)
known experimentally (data compiled in Ref. [6], including recently revised
values for HCN [125] and HNO [126]), after correction for inner-shell cor-
relation.

Needless to say, the conclusion that even with aug-cc-pV5Z basis sets
a mean absolute error of 0.7 kcal/mol is the best we can do seems rather
depressing. Alternatives were therefore sought, and found.

In his pioneering contribution, Schwartz [127] showed that the second-
order correlation energy of a helium-like atom in a singlet state has an
asymptotic expansion of the form

∆E(l) = A/(l + 1/2)4 + B/(l + 1/2)6 + O(l−8)

(18)

in which ∆E(l) represents the contribution of basis functions with angular
momentum l. Hill [128] then generalized this result to a variational calcu-
lation:

∆E(l) = A/(l + 1/2)4 + B/(l + 1/2)5 + O(l−6)

(19)

Kutzelnigg and Morgan [129] derived similar asymptotic expansions of
the second- and third-order MBPT energy of a two-electron atom in singlet
as well as triplet states. For the singlet, they found the expansion
∆E(l) = A/(l + 1/2)4 + B/(l + 1/2)5 + C/(l + 1/2)6 + O(l−7)

(20)
(where the l−5 term has no second-order contribution) while for the triplet,
the expansion starts two orders later, at (l + 1/2)−6. As pointed out in Ref.
[129], this result can be generalized to the second-and third-order energies
of many-electron atoms having an asymptotic correlation energy expansion
of the form eq. (20).

If so, the error for a calculation in a basis set truncated at angular

momentum L is given by

Assuming that higher orders in perturbation theory would behave simi-
larly, the idea of carrying out successive (say, CCSD(T)) calculations in
completely saturated basis sets up to given angular momenta L1, L2, L3,
followed by an extrapolation, then naturally suggests itself. In practice com-
plete saturation of a basis set up to a given angular momentum L is not
necessarily the most computationally eﬃcient alternative; the next best so-
lution would be to use a sequence of basis sets which are balanced in their
quality for radial and angular correlation, such as the ANO or correlation
consistent basis sets.

If we identify L with the n in the cc-pVnZ basis sets, an ambiguity
arises, in that the highest angular momentum present in the cc-pVnZ basis
set is n for ﬁrst-and second-row atoms, and n − 1 for hydrogen and helium.
As a compromise, we proposed [131] an extrapolation in terms of inverse
powers of L + 1/2.

Extending this approach to molecular calculations involves not so much
a leap of faith as the suggestion that molecular correlation eﬀects would be
predominantly atomic in character. We will introduce the following nota-
tions for two-point extrapolations to cc-pVlZ and cc-pVmZ energies:
Schwartz3(kl) A + B/(l + 1/2)3
Schwartz4(kl) A + B/(l + 1/2)4

and for three-point extrapolations to cc-pVlZ, cc-pVmZ, and cc-pVnZ

energies:
Schwartz46(klm) A + B/(l + 1/2)4 + C/(l + 1/2)6
A + B/(l + 1/2)α
Schwartzα(klm)

and so forth. (Note that the parameters in Schwartzα have to be deter-
mined iteratively, while the others can be found by solving a 2×2 or 3 × 3
linear system.)

Let us ﬁrst consider the MP2 energy. Klopper [132] obtained what are
considered essentially exact MP2 correlation energies for N2, H2O, Ne, and
HF using an explicitly correlated method. As seen below in Table 3, a
Schwartz3(56) extrapolation to MP2/AV5Z and MP2/AV6Z correlation
energies yields values in excellent agreement with the MP2-R12 results:
deviations are -0.27 mEh for Ne, -0.25 mEh for HF, +0.10 mEh for N2,
and -0.14 mEh for H2O, leading to a mean absolute deviation of 0.19
mEh. (Wilson and Dunning [133] found similar results with VnZ basis
sets.) A Schwartzα(Q56) extrapolation to MP2/AVQZ, MP2/AV5Z, and
MP2/AV6Z actually results in less good agreement (mean absolute devia-
tion of 0.6 mEh). This clearly suggests that Schwartz3 is the extrapolation
of choice for large basis set MP2 calculations, as well as that convergence

of the MP2 energy for aug-cc-pV5Z and larger basis sets is almost entirely
dominated by the leading Schwartz expansion term. Varying the α expo-
nent and adding MP2/AVQZ results does not result in an improvement: it
appears that for basis sets this size, the (l + 1/2)−3 term dominates basis
set convergence. By contrast, Feller(456) undershoots the MP2-R12 results
by as much as 3 millihartree.

Very recently, M¨uller, Kutzelnigg, and Noga (MKN) [134] (see Table 4)
published CCSD-R12 and CCSD(T)-R12 studies on a number of closed-
shell ten-electron systems, including F−, HF, Ne, and H2O. Some further
results of this type are available from the work of Halkier et al. [135]. MKN
quote all-electron results with two basis sets which we will denote A and

AB INITIO THERMOCHEMISTRY BEYOND CHEMICAL ACCURACY 23

B, but valence-only results only with the smaller of the two basis sets, A.
Since the main improvement in basis B over basis A is in the valence region
and, in Ref. [132], a basis set equivalent to A appeared to yield inner-shell
pair energies essentially equivalent to exact solution for Ne, we would argue
that the main deﬁciency in A will be for the valence region and not for the
inner-shell region. Therefore, the exact valence only CCSD(T) energy is
expected to lie close to valence(A)+all(B)-all(A).

Again, Feller(456) undershoots the CCSD-R12 and CCSD(T)-R12 re-
sults by several millihartree. Schwartz3(56) appears to overshoot the ener-
gies, while Schwartzα(456) appears to be in close agreement. It should be
noted that the exponent α here systematically favors values signiﬁcantly
higher than 3, in fact centering around 4. (This tendency is what led, in
our ﬁrst paper [131] on these extrapolations, to the suggestion of Schwartz4
and Schwartz46 as extrapolation formulas.) While Helgaker and cowork-
ers [135, 136] advocate the use of a ﬁxed exponent of 3 for CCSD and
CCSD(T) correlation energies as well, we would argue that the diﬀerence
with the convergence behavior at the MP2 level reﬂects the importance of
higher-order terms in eq.(20) in methods that include higher-order MBPT
terms (such as CCSD and CCSD(T), both of which include the complete
third-order energy, as well as important subclasses of excitations to in-
ﬁnite order). This is also consistent with the observation of the present
author [137] who found that the basis set increment ratio

TAE[MP2/AVnZ] – TAE[MP2/AV(n − 1)Z]
TAE[CCSD/AVnZ] – TAE[CCSD/AV(n − 1)Z]

(25)

becomes progressively larger as n increases, and exceeds unity for n=4 and
upwards.

Following the adage “the proof of the pudding is in the eating”, we con-
sidered [90] separate extrapolation of the CCSD(T)/A′VnZ (n=T, Q, 5)
valence correlation component of TAE using Schwartzα(TQ5), and of the
SCF component to Schwartz5(Q5) (or Feller(TQ5) — the results diﬀer neg-
ligibly), for our 15 reference molecules. Agreement with experiment (Table
5) speaks for itself, with mean and maximum absolute errors of 0.23 and
0.88 kcal/mol. If an additional small correction is introduced [90] for the es-
pecially slow basis set convergence in nitrogen compounds (0.126 kcal/mol
per bond order involving N), mean and maximum errors can be further
brought down to 0.12 and 0.49 kcal/mol, respectively — benchmark qual-
ity by any reasonable standard. The same methodology was also applied to
the ﬁrst-row hydrides and hydride radicals AHn [138], and some variants
were considered and extensively tested in Refs. [139, 140].

Finally, it is perhaps worth mentioning that the convergence of the sum
of SCF and correlation energies for relatively small basis sets (particularly

the erroneous conclusion that overall convergence behavior is best described
by an exponential series.

4.3. INDIVIDUAL OR GLOBAL EXTRAPOLATION?

For the two-point A + B/(l + 1/2)n extrapolations (n ﬁxed), it is easily
seen that extrapolation on individual energies or any reaction energy yields
identical results. With the other extrapolations, this equality does not hold.
In most cases, the ﬁnal result for total atomization energies will only diﬀer
by about 0.1 kcal/mol between the two approaches. Two observations are
relevant here.

First of all, as seen for the example of the ten-electron hydrides in
Table 6 below, the correlation component to atomization energies appears
to converge faster than that of the constituent total energies. For instance,
while the percentage of the valence correlation energy recovered by the

AB INITIO THERMOCHEMISTRY BEYOND CHEMICAL ACCURACY 25

AV5Z basis set varies from 99.0 % for CH4 to 97.8% in HF, consistently
99.5% to 99.7% is recovered for the valence correlation component to the
dissociation energy, which suggests a signiﬁcant cancellation of correlation
eﬀects between atom and molecule.

Secondly, it is easily seen from considering the diﬀerence of two asymp-

totic series (for Ecorr(X) and Ecorr(Y)) in (l + 1/2)

Ax − Ay + (Bx − By)/(l + 1/2)3 + (Cx − Cy)/(l + 1/2)4 + . . .

(26)

that situations may arise in which the coeﬃcients of the diﬀerence do not
decay as fast with increasing l as one might like, e.g. if X and Y are close
in energy to begin with. Under such circumstances, a three-point extrapo-
lation of the form A + B/(l + 1/2)C may not behave well numerically, and
extrapolation on the individual energies may be preferable. (We found this
to be the case, for instance, with electron aﬃnities.)

As a rule, the present author favors extrapolation on the energy diﬀer-
ence when the latter is fairly large (e.g. total atomization energies), and

26

JAN M.L. MARTIN

extrapolation on the constituent total energies when small energy diﬀer-
ences have to be determined (e.g. electron aﬃnities, conformational energy
diﬀerences).

5. Case studies

5.1. ELECTRON AFFINITIES OF THE FIRST-ROW ATOMS

Electron aﬃnities have in the past been notorious as a ‘tough nut to crack’
computationally. On the one hand, wave functions for anions extend fairly
far in space (requiring accomodation thereof in the basis set by the addition
of ‘diﬀuse functions’). On the other hand, electron aﬃnities involve small
diﬀerences in energy between systems with diﬀerent numbers of electrons —
a balanced description of which is a very taxing test for electron correlation
methods.

As a result, the electron aﬃnities of the ﬁrst-row atoms have tradition-
ally been used as a benchmark for computational methods (e.g. [59, 141–
144]) not only because of the small size of the system but because the
corresponding experimental quantities are accurately known. [145]

This problem is a good illustration of the issues that enter if one wants

to carry out a calculation to the very highest accuracy.

Since even for atoms, full conﬁguration interaction is not an option with
suﬃciently large basis sets, we will use CCSD(T) as our ‘baseline’ electron
correlation method. Our computed results are given in Table 7.

For the SCF and valence correlation contributions, we have carried
out CCSD(T)/AVQZ, CCSD(T)/AV5Z, and CCSD(T)/AV6Z calculations.
(The SCF energies are of course obtained on the ﬂy.) These involve basis
sets of [6s5p4d3f 2g], [7s6p5d4f 3g2h], and [8s7p6d5f 4g3h2i] quality, respec-
tively. For the SCF energy, we will use the A + B.C −l exponential extrap-
olation [120], for the valence correlation contribution the A + B/(l + 1/2)C
formula [131].

The extrapolation contributes on average much less than 0.001 eV to
the SCF component, which is basically completely converged with an AV6Z
basis set. Contributions to the valence correlation energy are somewhat
more signiﬁcant, reaching -0.016 eV for O and -0.014 eV for F. In all cases,
further basis set expansion is predicted to increase the EA, as expected.

The contribution of inner-shell correlation was obtained by carrying
out CCSD(T)/ACV5Z calculations both with all electrons correlated, and
with the (1s) like orbitals constrained to be doubly occupied. While the
core correlation energy may converge quite slowly in absolute terms, in
relative terms (in this case, its contribution to EA) convergence is usually
fairly rapid, with an ACVQZ basis set usually being large enough even
for accurate work, and an ACV5Z basis set deﬁnitely so. As expected, its

contribution increases EA in all cases (except of course for the trivial case
of H/H−).

The relativistic contribution can be decomposed into two terms: the
scalar contribution and the eﬀect of spin-orbit splitting. While an ab initio
purist would obtain the latter from computed spin-orbit coupling elements,
we have obtained them here from the observed ﬁne structure of the atomic
ground states. Especially for F/F−, its contribution to EA is quite signiﬁ-
cant; in all cases, a lowering of EA is seen.

The scalar relativistic contribution was obtained by ﬁrst-order per-
turbation theory applied to the Darwin and mass-velocity contributions.
[110, 111] Since they can be evaluated as a simple expectation value from
the converged wave function using this method, we have computed them at
the ACPF (augmented coupled pair functional) level. [112] Relativistic cal-
culations generally require greatly improved ﬂexibility of the wave function
in the high-exponent region, particularly in the s functions: we opted for
an uncontracted ACVQZ basis set. In all cases, the scalar relativistic con-
tribution decreases EA; as expected, the size of this contribution goes up
superlinearly with Z. (From a ﬁt of aZ b to the computed contributions, we
ﬁnd b ≈ 3.4 in this case.) While the importance of relativistic contributions
to this type of quantity for heavy elements is well known (e.g., the existence

28

JAN M.L. MARTIN

of the alkali aurides Rb+Au− and Cs+Au− is due to relativistic stabiliza-
tion of the 6s shell [109]), a contribution of -0.01 eV for an element as light
a F may seem surprising at ﬁrst. Since all electron aﬃnities discussed here
except EA(H) involve addition of an electron to a 2p orbital, Kendall et
al. [59] conclude that “relativistic eﬀects should contribute insigniﬁcantly
to the calculated electron aﬃnities”. Of course, whether or not -0.01 eV
is insigniﬁcant is a matter of the accuracy being pursued, as well as the
relative magnitude of the other possible sources of error.

Last but not least, we need to make an allowance for imperfections in
the CCSD(T) treatment. For B/B−, we have done so by comparing an
FCI/AVQZ calculation with the corresponding CCSD(T)/AVQZ results.
This calculation took about ﬁve hours on an SGI Origin 2000 minisu-
percomputer, and could not be carried to completion even for C−. Since
however the FCI-CCSD(T) correction for EA(B) appears to converge very
rapidly (with the AVDZ, AVTZ, and AVQZ basis sets we obtain values of
0.0186, 0.0197, and 0.0191 eV, respectively), we may fairly safely use the
diﬀerence between FCI/AVTZ and CCSD(T)/AVTZ in the case of EA(C).
For O/O− and F/F−, even FCI/AVTZ calculations are not feasible. Assum-
ing that the error in the full CCSDT method with respect to FCI is fairly
constant, we have therefore employed a two-stage additivity approximation
in these cases:

E[FCI/AV∞Z] ≈ E[CCSD(T)/AV∞Z]
+ (E[CCSDT/AVQZ] − E[CCSD(T)/AVQZ])
+ (E[FCI/AVDZ] − E[CCSDT/AVDZ])

(27)

As seen in Table 7, the ﬁnal results agree with experiment to within
about 0.001 eV on average. The largest discrepancies, 0.0015 eV, occur for
EA(O) and EA(F), which are also the largest and for which some of the
individual contributions (e.g. the relativistics) are also the largest.

5.2. ATOMIZATION ENERGY OF SIH4 AND THE HEAT OF FORMATION
OF SI(G)

The heat of formation of Si(g) is the subject of some controversy. In the
JANAF tables it is given as 106.6±1.9 kcal/mol. Desai [146] reviewed the
available data and recommended the JANAF value, but with a reduced
uncertainty of ±1.0 kcal/mol. Recently, Grev and Schaefer [71] found that
their ab initio calculation of the TAE of SiH4, despite basis set incomplete-
ness, was actually larger than the value derived from the experimental heats
of formation of Si(g), H(g), and SiH4(g). They suggested that the heat
of vaporization of silicon be revised upwards to ∆H ◦
f,0[Si(g)]=108.07(50)
kcal/mol, a suggestion supported by Ochterski et al. [147]. Clearly, some

AB INITIO THERMOCHEMISTRY BEYOND CHEMICAL ACCURACY 29

calibration calculation to resolve this controversy would be desirable: we
will here report some preliminary results obtained as a by-product of an
anharmonic force ﬁeld study [148] on SiH4. While Grev and Schaefer’s work
was deﬁnitely state of the art in its time, the attainable accuracy for this
type of compound may well have gone up an order of magnitude in the six
years since it was published.

From a calibration calculation along the lines discussed above, our
best calculation for the nonrelativistic valence CCSD(T) limit is 324.62
kcal/mol. For this molecule, we may assume fairly safely that CCSD(T)
is close to full CI. Deducting the Si spin-orbit splitting correction (0.43
kcal/mol), adding a core correlation contribution of -0.34 kcal/mol (with the
MT core correlation basis set) and deducting a fully anharmonic zero-point
energy of 19.57 kcal/mol (from a CCSD(T)/VQZ+1 quartic force ﬁeld) we
obtain TAE0=304.28 kcal/mol. Using the revised ∆H ◦
f,0[Si(g)]=108.07(50)
kcal/mol of Grev and Schaefer [71] we obtain ∆H ◦
in excellent agreement with the JANAF value of 10.5(5) kcal/mol. At ﬁrst
sight this supports the new value.

f,0[SiH4(g)]=10.34 kcal/mol,

Upon introducing the scalar relativistic correction of -0.67 kcal/mol,
however, we obtain a value of 11.0 kcal/mol, which is only just compati-
ble with the experimental measurement. Using the older JANAF/CODATA
value ∆H ◦
f,0[Si(g)]=106.6±1.0 kcal/mol, we would ﬁnd 9.54 kcal/mol, seem-
ingly incompatible with the experimental result for SiH4. However, as pointed
out by Grev and Schaefer [71], the JANAF value is in fact the Gunn and
Green [149] value of 9.5 kcal/mol increased by a correction [150] of +1
kcal/mol for the phase transition Si(amorphous)→Si(cr). If one were to fol-
low Gunn and Green in considering this correction to be an artifact of the
method of preparation and in neglecting it, our calculations would in fact
support the old JANAF/CODATA ∆H ◦

f,0[Si(g)].

Regardless of who is ‘right’ here (CODATA or Grev and Schaefer),
the above serves as an illustration that, where the accurate determination
of fundamental thermochemical quantities is at stake, the greatest care
is required, both in performing the calculations and in interpreting the
experiments.

5.3. HEAT OF FORMATION OF B(G) VIA THE TOTAL ATOMIZATION
ENERGY OF BF3

Nonthermochemists are often surprised when they hear that the heats of
formation in the gas phase of three ﬁrst-and second-row atoms (namely, Be,
B, and Si) are imprecisely known because of various experimental compli-

no less than 3 kcal/mol, ∆H 0
f (B(g))=132.7±3.0 kcal/mol [119]. This is ob-
viously a very unsatisfactory state of aﬀairs given the fact that just about

Storms and Mueller (SM) [151] had previously recommended a much
higher and more precise value of 136.2±0.2 kcal/mol. Ruˇsˇci´c et al. [152],
reviewing the experimental data, concluded that the JANAF value was
in error and recommended the SM value. Recently, Ochterski et al. [147]
combined calculated atomization energies using the CBS-APNO hybrid ab
initio/empirical scheme [124] with an accurate CODATA [153] heat of for-
mation for BF3, 271.2±0.2 kcal/mol, and the established heat of forma-
tion for F(g), 18.47±0.07 kcal/mol, to obtain 135.7 kcal/mol. On the basis
thereof, they too recommended the SM value. Note that their calculation
does not include a correction for the spin-orbit splitting in atomic ﬂuorine
and therefore is about 1.1 kcal/mol too high (see below). In another study,
Schlegel and Harris [154] found that computed heats of formation using
the Gaussian-2 (G2) method [4] for a number of boron compounds agreed
much better with experiment if the reference value for gaseous boron was
taken as the SM rather than the JANAF value.

Martin and Taylor [123] carried out a calibration calculation aimed at
resolving this discrepancy for once and for all. All relevant energies are
given in Tables 8 and 9.

The largest calculation we could carry out on BF3 was CCSD(T)/AV5Z
(508 basis functions), which required 60 GB of disk space and 720 MB
of memory on the CRAY T90. Because the next step up in basis set,
CCSD(T)/AV6Z (756 basis functions) was simply beyond the available
computational hardware, we used the BF diatomic as a model system for
the eﬀect of further basis set extension.

The SCF component of the atomization energy of BF3 diﬀers only -0.02
kcal/mol between AVQZ and AV5Z basis sets, and is essentially converged.
For BF, increasing the basis set another step to AV6Z only aﬀects the
result by 0.01 kcal/mol; upon exponential extrapolation, the Feller(Q56)
total SCF energy, −124.168760 Eh, is found to be only 20 µEh above the
numerical Hartree-Fock result [122].

Improving the basis set from AVQZ to AV5Z increases the valence cor-
relation energy by some 1.39 kcal/mol, compared to 4.46 kcal/mol from
AVTZ to AVQZ. The Schwartzα(TQ5) extrapolation adds on another 0.84

kcal/mol; note that while the value of α for BF3 is about 3.40, the α
found for the MP2 correlation energy, 2.88, strongly suggests dominance
of the leading (l + 1/2)−3 term. The diﬀerence between the MP2 and
CCSD(T) values of α suggests the importance of higher-order contribu-
tions, which add [129] higher powers in (l + 1/2). For the BF model system,
the Schwartzα(TQ5) extrapolated value is no less than 0.37 kcal/mol below
the Schwartzα(Q56) value: this unusually large diﬀerence is to some extent

32

JAN M.L. MARTIN

due to the very polar character of the B–F bond. (In fact, Gillespie [155]
argues that BF3 is best regarded as a tricoordinate ionic compound of B3+.)
Since BF3 actually contains three bonds that are quite similar to the one
in BF, it seems reasonable that the diﬀerence between Schwartzα(TQ5) and
Schwartzα(Q56) would be approximately three times that in BF. Hence we
obtain an estimated basis set limit for the correlation part of TAE of 95.14
kcal/mol. In combination with the SCF contribution of 374.57 kcal/mol
this yields a valence-only TAE, without spin-orbit correction, of 469.71
kcal/mol.

The contribution of inner-shell correlation to the TAE of BF3 is found
to be 1.37 kcal/mol at the CCSD(T)/CVTZ level and 1.72 kcal/mol at
the CCSD(T)/CVQZ level. Given the polarity of the system, some mild
coupling between the eﬀects of core correlation and inclusion of diﬀuse
functions cannot be ruled out a priori, and indeed extending the CVQZ
to an ACVQZ basis set adds some 0.05 kcal/mol to the core correlation
energy. Based on experience [69] we normally expect the core correlation
contribution to be near convergence with such basis sets.

Again using the BF diatomic as a model system permits us to gauge
the eﬀects of further improvement of the core correlation basis set. At the
CCSD(T)/ACVQZ level, the core correlation contribution to De(BF) is
0.65 kcal/mol, or slightly more than one-third the value in BF3. Enlarg-
ing the basis from CVQZ to CV5Z leads to an increase of 0.04 kcal/mol:
the eﬀect from ACVQZ to ACV5Z is somewhat smaller at 0.03 kcal/mol.
(The CV5Z and ACV5Z values diﬀer by only 0.01 kcal/mol.) Carrying out a
Schwartzα(TQ5) extrapolation on the ACVTZ, ACVQZ, and ACV5Z num-
bers leads to an estimated inﬁnite-basis limit core correlation contribution
to the BF De of 0.70 kcal/mol, or 0.05 kcal/mol more than the computed
ACVQZ value.

If we again use three times this value as a correction for BF3, we obtain
a best estimate for the inner-shell correlation contribution to TAE(BF3) of
1.92 kcal/mol. We hence obtain a TAEe,N R (i.e. without spin-orbit correc-
tion) of 471.65 kcal/mol; deducting the atomic spin-orbit corrections ﬁnally
yields TAEe=470.46 kcal/mol.

From the computed CCSD(T)/VTZ harmonic frequencies and anhar-
monicity constants given in Ref. [156], we obtain ZPE=7.89 kcal/mol. If we
substitute experimental fundamentals (see Ref [156] for details) and employ
the computed anharmonicity constants only for the small diﬀerence between
the zero-point energy and one-half the sum of the fundamentals, ZPE de-
creases to 7.83 kcal/mol. We hence obtain the total atomization energy for
BF3 at 0 K, TAE0=462.63 kcal/mol.

In combination with the JANAF [119] heat of formation for F(g) of
18.47±0.07 kcal/mol and the CODATA [153] heat of formation of BF3(g),

f,0(B(g))=136.38±0.3 kcal/mol,
in which the uncertainty only reﬂects the uncertainties in the experimental
quantities. The possible further error in the calculations is somewhat more
diﬃcult to quantify: past experience suggests a mean absolute error of 0.12
kcal/mol, but in the light of the fairly substantial correction terms applied,
it would probably be appropriate to increase the error margin to about 0.3
kcal/mol. This would then bring our best estimate to 136.4±0.4 kcal/mol,
the uncertainty of which encompasses that of the SM value of 136.2±0.2
kcal/mol.

In the published study [123], we did not consider two contributions: im-
perfections in the CCSD(T) method and scalar relativistic contributions.
The former are rather hard to quantify since a full CI calculation for this
system, even in a fairly small basis set, is not a realistic option at present.
We can determine the latter by an ACPF/CVTZ(uncontracted) calculation
of the Darwin and mass-velocity contributions, which we ﬁnd to be -0.68
kcal/mol. Adding another 0.1 kcal/mol to the error bar in order to accom-
modate uncertainty in this contribution, we then have a best estimate for

34

JAN M.L. MARTIN

the heat of atomization at 0 K of B of 135.7±0.5 kcal/mol, which is still
compatible with the SM value.

6. Conclusions

We have shown that by judicious use of extrapolations to the 1-particle basis
set limit and n-particle calibration techniques, total atomization energies of
molecules with up to four heavy atoms can be obtained with calibration ac-
curacy (1 kJ/mol or better, on average) without any empirical correction.
For the SCF energy a 3-point geometric extrapolation is the method of
choice. For the MP2 correlation energy, a 2-point A + B/(l + 1/2)3 extrapo-
lation is recommended, while for CCSD and CCSD(T) correlation energies
we prefer the 3-point A + B/(l + 1/2)C formula. Addition of high-exponent
‘inner polarization functions’ to second-row atoms is essential for reliable
results. For the highest accuracy, accounts are required of inner-shell corre-
lation, atomic spin-orbit splitting, anharmonicity in the zero-point energy,
and scalar relativistic eﬀects.

Abstract

The dynamics of spin-lattice relaxation (slr) of metal-organic Pt(II) compounds
is studied. Often, such systems are characterized by pronounced zero-ﬁeld splittings
(zfs) of the lowest-lying triplets. Previous expressions for the Orbach slr process do
not allow to treat such splitting patterns properly. We discuss the behavior of a
modiﬁed Orbach expression for a model system and present results of a ﬁt of the
temperature dependence of the spin-lattice relaxation rate of Pt(2-thpy)2 based on
the modiﬁed expression.

Transition metal complexes with organic chelate ligands and their lowest ex-
cited states are of potential use for solar energy conversion [1–7]. Recently, the
processes of spin-lattice relaxation and the decay behavior of excited states
have been studied experimentally for such systems in Shpol’skii matrices. [8–
14] Of special importance are compounds with a Pt(II) central ion. Pt(II)
systems exhibit many diﬀerent types of low-lying excited triplets that in-
clude metal-centered (MC) dd∗ states [15,16], metal-to-ligand-charge-transfer
(MLCT) states [17–19], intra-ligand-charge-transfer (ILCT) states [10,13,20],
ligand-ligand′-charge-transfer (LL′CT) states [6,7], and ligand-centered (LC)

states with some MLCT and/or MC contribution [21–23]. In the following, we
focus to Pt(II) systems with heterocyclic chelate ligands.

As shown in Tab. 1, the low-lying triplets of these systems are characterized
by a rather large variation of zero-ﬁeld splittings (zfs) in the range from less
than 0.1 cm−1 to about 40 cm−1. The larger splittings are mainly due to
spin-orbit coupling. For the same complex in diﬀerent matrices, the lowest
triplet states are shifted in energy (in many cases in the range of 200 – 400
cm−1). The corresponding optical spectra show rich vibrational structure that
may be well resolved (about 2 cm−1) by choosing appropriate matrices and by
employing methods of emission and/or excitation line narrowing.

At low temperatures (several Kelvin), the processes of spin-lattice relaxation
occurring between the triplet sublevels |ai, |bi, and |ci are relatively slow with
relaxation times as long as hundreds of nano-seconds and even up to many
micro-seconds (See Tab. 1 and Refs. [9–14]) due to the low density of phonon
states corresponding to such zfs patterns.

To discuss these processes, we assume that the perturbation V caused by the
phonons couples the electronic states of the chromophore essentially linearly

where ǫk is the strain corresponding to the phonon mode with wave vector k
in the long wavelength limit. The matrix elements of V1 are denoted by Vba =
|hb|V1|ai| and analogous expressions for Vca and Vcb. The energy diﬀerences are
∆Eba between |bi and |ai, ∆Ecb between |ci and |bi, and ∆Eca between |ci and
|ai. The usual notation β = 1/(kBT ) for given temperature T and Boltzmann
ba (∆Eba)3 and analogous ones
constant kB, and the abbreviations Cba = C V 2
for Cca and Ccb are also used. Here, the parameter C = 3/(2π¯h4ρv5) is deﬁned
in terms of mass density ρ and (average) velocity v of sound of the matrix.
The (∆Eba)3 dependence of Cba should be kept in mind.

The following relaxation processes (see Fig. 1) occur:

Direct process: The rate is given by [30, p. 541], [29, p. 229]

Here, kab and kba are the rate constants for the up and down processes, re-
spectively, given by the expressions

Analogous expressions hold for the up and down rates kbc, kcb, kac, and kca.

Orbach process: The rate for this process vanishes for T → 0 K exponen-
tially. It depends on the splitting pattern of the three involved states: If the
energy separation ∆Eba of the two lower states |ai and |bi is much smaller
than both the energy separations ∆Eca and ∆Ecb to the upper state |ci, then
the well-known expression

k(Orbach)
a,b

=

2CcbCca
(Cca + Ccb)

(eβ∆E −1)

holds approximately for low T . This original Orbach expression is derived
under the assumption that the energy diﬀerences are given by ∆E = ∆Eca =
∆Ecb > 0. For a more general zfs pattern, the rate is given by the low-tempe-
rature approximation [31]

k(Orbach)
a,b

=

kackcb + kbckca − kbckba
kca + kcb − kba

with up and down rates as given in Eq. (3). The modiﬁed expression (5)
contains Eq. (4) as a limiting case (see Ref. [31]).

Raman process: For low temperature, the rate may be approximated by

k(Raman)
a,b

= D T n

with a constant D and n = 5 for non-Kramers ions [32]. In the cases under
study, this T 5 dependence ﬁts the experimental observations [31] better than
the T 7 dependence observed in other systems.

The relative importance of the various slr processes is largely dependent on
the size of the zfs and the energy separations to further electronic states. For
instance, in systems like Pt(qol)2 and Pt(qtl)2 with a very small total zfs (see
Tab. 1) and no further electronic states in the vicinity of T1, direct and Orbach
processes are expected to be very small due to the ∆E3 dependence of these
processes, and the Raman process is expected to dominate. Compare also Ref.
[31].

The behavior of the above expressions is illustrated for a model system (with-
out a Raman process) and with parameters ∆Eba = ∆Ecb = 7 cm−1, v = 2000
m/s, ρ = 1.1 g/cm3, Vbc = 10 cm−1, Vac = 20 cm−1, Vab = 3 cm−1. In Fig. 2, the

for the three-level system that is obtained from the rate equations [31].

Applying the original Orbach expression, i.e., using Eq. (4) in combination
with (2) for the direct process, the prefactor 2CcbCca/(Cca + Ccb) was com-
puted from the model parameters, but diﬀerent values of the parameter ∆E
have been used: ∆E = ∆Ecb corresponds to using the minimum distance of

5

state |ci to the states |ai and |bi (curve i) in Fig. 2), ∆E = ∆Eca corresponds
to using the maximum distance (curve ii)), and ∆E = (∆Eca + ∆Ecb)/2 cor-
responds to using the mean distance (curve iii)). The value ∆E = ∆Eﬁt =
5.4cm−1 is obtained by a least square ﬁt of the exact data with one ﬁt parame-
ter ∆E (curve iv)), i.e., for the direct process and the prefactor of Eq. (4), the
exact expressions were used during the ﬁt. Interestingly, ∆Eﬁt is less than any
of the other diﬀerences of the energies. Alternatively, one could try to use the
prefactor in Eq. (4) as an additional ﬁt parameter. But then, one cannot hope
to extract the model values of Ccb and Cca from such a ﬁt. Finally, curve v) in
Fig. 2 was obtained using the modiﬁed expression (5) in combination with Eq.
(2) for the direct process. Clearly, the modiﬁed approach yields much reduced
errors over a large temperature range. Thus, Orbach’s original expression (4)
that was designed for a diﬀerent pattern of the energy levels cannot be applied
to a pattern with ∆Ecb ≈ ∆Eba for any reasonable choice of the parameter
∆E.

We remark that similar results are also obtained for diﬀerent choices of the
parameters. For instance, for a value of v smaller by a factor f , the same
results for the absolute rates would be obtained, if all the matrix elements
of V1 are also chosen smaller by a factor f 5/2, e.g., for v = 1500 m/s and
Vbc = 4.87 cm−1, Vac = 9.74 cm−1, Vab = 1.46 cm−1. Moreover, ﬁxing all the
other parameters, any rescaling of the three matrix elements by an arbitrary
common positive factor yields the same error curves since we are dealing with
relative errors and, under this scaling, all up and down rates kab, kba etc., and,
hence, all slr rates in the model are multiplied by a common factor.

It is of interest to present an example of the application of the above formalism
to the spin-lattice relaxation observed for the lowest triplet of the Pt(2-thpy)2
complex in an n-octane matrix. This compound is depicted in of Fig. 3, and
some properties are collected in Table 1. The experimental spin-lattice relax-
ation rate k(slr) is obtained from the measured emission decay rate of state
|bi by subtraction of the corresponding triplet deactivation rate to the ground
state [31]. For the ﬁt, we used Eq. (2) for the direct process, the modiﬁed
expression (5) for the Orbach process, and Eq. (6) with n = 5 for the Raman
process, i.e., for a T 5 low temperature dependence. As prefactor of the direct
process, we used the low temperature limit of k(slr). The ratio of Cca/Ccb can
be obtained independently from time-resolved excitation spectra [9,31]. Also,
all energy separations ∆Eba and ∆Ecb are available from highly resolved spec-
tra [9,21,14,31]. Thus, as ﬁt parameter, only the prefactor D of the Raman
process and the constant Cca remain. For such a two-parameter ﬁt as displayed
in Fig. 3, the result is highly satisfactory.

A three-parameter ﬁt based on the original Orbach expression (4) using the pa-
rameters D, ∆E and the prefactor in Eq. (4) yields the value ∆E = 11.4 cm−1
(and a nearly doubled prefactor D for the Raman process in comparison to

the ﬁt displayed in Fig. 3). A similar value for ∆E was obtained in Ref. [9] by
a somewhat diﬀerent ﬁtting procedure. Both these values are unphysical since
they do not correspond to any of the observed energy diﬀerences (see Tab. 1).
We remark that the present study was triggered by this diﬃculty of using the
original Orbach expression (4).

This result shows, as further ones presented in [33,31], that the use of the
modiﬁed expression (5) for the Orbach process is necessary for a detailed un-
derstanding of the dynamics of the spin-lattice relaxation for low-lying triplets
of metal-organic transition metal compounds with their characteristic patterns
of zero-ﬁeld splitting. Thus, although the present study concentrated on Pt(II)
compounds, the result should be applicable to a more general class of com-
pounds, namely, the whole platinum metal group complexes (compare, e.g.,
the recent results [8,9] for [Ru(bpy)3]2+).

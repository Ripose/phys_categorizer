Abstract

It is shown that diﬀerences observed between the ionization poten-
tials of the molecular-doped metallic clusters and those corresponding
to the bare metallic ones can be explained by a two-step approach of
the classical Liquid Drop Model. This approach takes into account
the distinct physical properties of the interface between the molecular
core and the metallic shell. Also, it is shown that the presence of
the molecular core may act in the determination of the predominant
channel of the coulombic ﬁssion.

Much of the recent interest in binary clusters has focused on the stabil-
ity of atomic micro-objects consisting of metal atoms surrounding an elec-
tronegative impurity [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. There are mainly two interesting
features exhibited in the behavior of the binary clusters. Most striking is
the appearance of non-stoichiometric structures, i.e. the octet rule of the
chemical bonding is apparently broken, in the size range of small clusters (a
few metal atoms surrounding the electronegative element) [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7].
Such systems are usually called hypervalent molecules. Nevertheless, by in-
creasing progressively the number of metal atoms, the transition to metal-
licity appears as expected.
It has been well demonstrated that the pas-
sage towards the metallic state is accompanied by a structural transition

1

[9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18]. Accordingly, in the size range of metal-
rich clusters, a segregation shows up between a stoichiometric ionically bound
part and the excess metallic component.

It has been suggested that the molecular core segregated around the im-
purity acts to conﬁne the valence electrons into a higher density [10]. This is
a quantum size eﬀect which results in a perturbation of the electronic den-
sity of states by a cluster-size dependent amount. Usually, this eﬀect can be
observed in the ionization potentials [16, 17, 18, 19]. For example, the ion-
ization potentials of the lithium monoxide cluster (LinO) are systematically
larger (0.1 − 0.15 eV ) than the values of the bare lithium clusters (Lin) in
the size range 2 ≤ n ≤ 70 [19]. Although the diﬀerence is much smaller, the
same trend is also observed for lithium monocarbide clusters (LinC) [19].
In the context of the quantum size eﬀect, observed diﬀerences in the val-
ues of the size dependent ionization potentials of LinO and LinC clusters in
comparison with bare Lin clusters have been interpreted and argued for in
terms of distinct internal contributions (the binding energy and the surface
potential barrier) to the work function [19]. A cluster-size dependent work
function has been derived for doped clusters which is sensitive both to the
electronegative character of the impurity and to the size of the molecular
core surrounding the impurity.

The quantum size eﬀect as we brieﬂy introduced above can be observed,
e.g. for clusters having spherical shapes, as long as the radial dimensions of
the molecular and metallic parts are comparable. When the metallic part is
much greater, the presence of the electronegative impurity is fully screened
by the valence electron gas and the metallic characteristics of doped metallic
clusters tend to become similar with those exhibited by bare metallic ones.
This has been proven in our previous paper [19].

Nevertheless, the presence of the electronegative element with its sur-
rounding molecular part may aﬀect the behavior of the binary clusters in
physical processes which can be explained without involving necessarily their
quantum aspects. For instance, one can make use of a classical Liquid Drop
Model (LDM) which, generally, allows an accurate computation of the ion-
ization potentials and, particularly, oﬀers a suitable description of the frag-
mentation processes due to the coulombic ﬁssion [20, 21, 22, 23]. Because
in the present case one must account for distinct properties of the molecular
core, the LDM employed in the following is a two-step approach. At the
ﬁrst instant, one can speculate on the fact that the molecular part segre-

2

gated around the impurity acts itself as an entity by inducing a tension at
the interface with the metallic outer shell. Therefore, the molecular core may
behave diﬀerently under shape deformations. This fact certainly changes the
energy balance between the charged (deformed) state of the doped cluster
and that corresponding to the bare one. This diﬀerence can be observed in
the ionization potentials [16, 17, 18, 19]. On the other hand, the molecular
core can equally be seen as a mixing part which gives rise to a conﬁgura-
tional entropy contribution. The presence of the entropic term in the total
free energy of the system may aﬀect the determination of the predominant
ﬁssion channel for charged (deformed) binary clusters. The behavior of the
molecular-doped metallic cluster associated with these two particular aspects
is the focus of this paper.

The segregation of the molecular inner core changes locally the inter-
atomic potential and chemical bond lengths. The change of the potential
energy surface rises restoring forces acting against formation of the curved
interface between metallic and molecular parts. The fact can be expressed
in terms of interface tension [24]

of host metal atoms localized by the electronegative impurity and rs is the
inter-electron space (the Wigner-Seitz radii). By specifying the atomic radius
of the electronegative impurity (ro), the size of the molecular core can also
be set to

ask now the question if the energy balance between the initial and ﬁnal
cluster states during the physical processes which involve shape deformations
maintains the ﬁngerprint of the molecular core. For example, the cluster
shape undergoes deformations during the ionization process equally due to
the electrifying phenomenon [20] and thermal perturbation [25]. Certainly,
the charged state of a metallic cluster is a deformed one. The deformation
is presumably over the entire system, which means that the molecular core
is also aﬀected by this change of the cluster state. It will be shown in the
following that the information about the molecular core does not cancel when
considering energy diﬀerences between the charged (deformed) and neutral
states.

Certainly, the spherical approximation, usually invoked within the jel-
lium model for clusters [21], becomes less useful for charged clusters whose
shapes deform due to the balance between electric and surface forces.[20]
Complementary to the jellium model is then the Liquid Drop Model [20, 21].
Accordingly, when a spherical cluster of radius R0, is deformed (conserving
the volume) toward an ellipsoidal shape, its area changes to

As we can see, the surface energy is a minimum when the cluster is
spherical: The surface energy disfavors deformation. On the other hand, the
electrostatic energy is a maximum when the cluster is undeformed: It favors
the deformation. Consequently, the relative strengths of the electric and
surface forces will determine the shape of a charged cluster which is rather
deformed.

As a consequence of the cluster deformation, we can expect that the
molecular core undergoes deformations, too. The degree of deformation of
the molecular core depends on the strength of the molecular bonds. In the
following, we will assume that the change from the sphericity of the molecular
inner part can be measured by a deformation parameter γ, in the same
manner as for the entire system

At this point one may conclude that the charged state of a cluster is a
deformed one, the deformation giving rise, in the present case, to changes of
the surface/interface energies.

where ∆Γ is the diﬀerence between the semimajor and semiminor axes of
the ellipsoid. This cancels exactly with the cluster-size dependence of the
last terms in (14) and makes the surface contribution to depend only on

6

∆Γ. In the limit of very large clusters this contribution becomes negligible
(∆Γ = 0) and, in the asymptotic limit, IPbare → W F . The same applies
in (13) with regard both to the surface and interface contributions. As γ
is directly related to β, the deformation of the molecular part during the
ionization process being a consequence of the deformation over the entire
system, the inﬂuence of the molecular core will also diminish in the limit of
large clusters.

Looking at (13) and (14) , one can see that, apart the surface/interface
contributions, the other factors which promotes the diﬀerence between the
ionization potentials of the binary, metal-rich and bare metallic clusters are
the reduction of the valence electron number of the cluster (n − p instead
of n) and the change of the work function (the usual work function W F
is replaced in (13) by a work function for binary clusters, that is W Fbin)
[19]. This change of the work function for doped clusters is a quantum
size eﬀect due to the perturbation of the electron density. This diﬀerence
disappears with increasing cluster size, the impurity being fully screened by
the remaining free electrons for a cluster with about 100 atoms, as it has
been proven in our previous work [19].

In the following, we disregard the distinct internal contributions to the
work function of doped clusters arising from the quantum size eﬀect (W F =
W Fbin), and focus on the surface/interface contributions promoted by dis-
tortions of the cluster shape. We derive the ratio between IP and IPbare ,

We make a numerical test for the above result and compare with the ex-
perimental observation as reported in Ref.
[19]. For example, in the size
domain of of large clusters (n > 6), the experimental IP ′s of oxygen doped
lithium clusters are systematically larger (about 4%) than the values of the
bare lithium clusters. By looking to the above equation (16), we see that for
n ≫ 1, this can can be approximated by

We set p = 2 and n = 20 (this is supposed to be the case of (Li2O) Li18
cluster) and observe that the diﬀerence IP − IPbare of about 4%, as reported
in Ref.
[19], can be obtained if either the tension is higher at the surface
than at the interface (σM ≃ 5σm) at γ = β, or, equivalently, γ2
β2 ≤ 0.04 at
σM ≃ σm. The latter means that the molecular core is less aﬀected by the
distortion of the entire cluster. The molecular core opposes to the external
action exerted by the metallic outer shell. Indeed, both eﬀects can concur to
set the above diﬀerence.

(18)

At small cluster sizes, when the charged clusters are rather deformed, the
interface contribution in (9) can play an important role. This has a material
dependence by σm (R). There is a sizeable body of work on aspects of the
statistical mechanical theory of interfacial phenomena [28]. Anyway, it is
diﬃcult to say what results tell us about the physical properties of a real
interface. The concept of a bare surface/interface tension is controversial,
since correlation eﬀects for the restoring force contribute also to the speciﬁc
thermodynamical potential. Looking at (1) , we can see that the curvature
aﬀects the surface tension. The eﬀect comes to light at full extent for micro-
scopic drops whose radii approach the range of intermolecular forces. The
Tolman length δ entering (1) has negative values [24]

δ ∼= −0.39ξ

,

which depends on the characteristic lengths of the intermolecular potentials,
ξ. Obviously, we can imagine that diﬀerent properties of the binary clusters
can be explained by taking the particular chemical structure of the molecular
part into account. Some geometrical structures of the molecular part can
fetter the ellipsoidal deformation of the entire system or, by contrast, others
can favor it. So that, the geometrical structure of the molecular part can
play a role in moderating the distortion tendency of the charged clusters.

Another aspect related to the presence of the molecular inner core is
the behavior of the binary clusters during the fragmentation processes by

predominantly with asymmetrical character [25]. The discrete nature of the
cluster constituents become important in this case, since the same fragments

aﬀect the determination of the predominant ﬁssion channel, we describe the

and shows that the same fragments may consist of diﬀerent atoms. We
notice that in the extreme case when one of the ﬁssion product, let say q,
energies,
is just the molecular core, the surface
which control the ﬁssion process, must be properly replaced in (20). The
surface term corresponding to the fragment q can be derived starting from
(1). The estimation of the coulomb energy of the fragment q must account
for the appropriate character of the chemical bond in the molecular core. To
compare with the trivial case of bare metallic clusters, we make the terms
afi and ap equal each other (afi ≡ ap = a), and replace cfq = 3
8 cfn−q = 7
4
and cp = 33
8 [29]. We observe that the predominant ﬁssion channel for binary
clusters is aﬀected by the physical properties of the molecular core. We can
also see that if the molecular core is more stable than the rest of the metallic
cluster then, the size of the molecular core acts as a lower bound for the
characteristic mass of the ﬁssion product (q > p + 1) [13].

Finally, the present study on binary, metal-rich clusters based on a two-
step LDM approach allowed us to point out their diﬀerent behavior in com-
parison with the corresponding bare metallic species. This behavior has a
general feature for metal-rich clusters, in agreement with the segregation ev-
idence of the molecular part: The molecular core acts itself as an entity by
inducing a tension at the interface with the metallic outer shell and as a mix-
ing part by giving rise to a conﬁgurational entropy contribution. The former
depends on the chemical character of the binding and its energetic contribu-
tion is in direct proportion with the interface area. The latter comes to light
at full extent for rather high temperatures. The eﬀect of the former leads
to an energetic balance in the ﬁnal (charged) state of the cluster wherefrom
the diﬀerence between the ionization potentials of the doped clusters and
corresponding pure clusters shows up. The latter aﬀects the determination
of the predominant ﬁssion channel of the coulombic ﬁssion. The size of the
molecular core can act as a lower bound for the characteristic mass of the
ﬁssion product.

Concluding, one can say that, although the metallic characteristics def-
initely predominate in the range of large cluster sizes, the electronegative
impurity still aﬀects (not dramatically, indeed) their thermodynamical prop-
erties. Thus, the molecular core of the binary, metal-rich cluster has a re-
sponse to external actions, this resulting in a change of the total energy of
the system.

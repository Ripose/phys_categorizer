The Stark interaction of polar molecules with an inhomogeneous electric ﬁeld is exploited to select
slow molecules from a room-temperature eﬀusive source. A linear electrostatic quadrupole with a
curved section guides only molecules with small transverse and longitudinal velocities, whereas the
fast molecules escape the guide and are pumped away. The source is tested with formaldehyde
(H2CO) and deuterated ammonia (ND3). With H2CO a continuous ﬂux is measured of ≈ 109/s and
longitudinal temperatures of a few K. The results are compared with a Monte Carlo simulation.

The past years have seen an explosion of activity in the
ﬁeld of cold atomic gases [1]. It is interesting and desir-
able to extend these investigations to molecules, which
have a complex internal structure and can as a con-
sequence possess a permanent electric dipole moment.
Trapping cold polar molecules will lead to new physics
due to the long range and anisotropy of the dipole-dipole
interaction. Cold molecules for precision measurements is
another motivation behind the ongoing eﬀorts. However,
the complexity and density of energy levels in the rota-
tional and vibrational manifolds largely precludes the ef-
fective use of laser cooling techniques. Therefore, a num-
ber of diﬀerent approaches has been considered for cool-
ing and trapping molecules. Buﬀer-gas cooling in a cryo-
genic environment is one possibility, but requires a rather
complex setup [2]. Another method is photoassociation,
but this is limited to simple molecules with laser-cooled
precursor atoms [3]. A novel technique uses deceleration
by the Stark eﬀect, where packages of polar molecules
are decelerated with time-varying electric ﬁelds [4, 5, 6].
Other, mostly mechanical methods have also been pro-
posed but remain to be demonstrated [7, 8, 9].

It is, however, not necessary to produce slow molecules,
as they are present in any thermal gas, even at room tem-
perature. Slow molecules only need to be ﬁltered out. For
this reason, already in the 1950s it was attempted to se-
lect the slowest atoms from a hot beam using gravity [10].
These attempts failed, mostly because the slow particles
were kicked away by the fast ones. Much later it was
demonstrated that slow lithium atoms can be guided out
of a hot beam with strong permanent magnets [11]. How-
ever, by that time the advent of laser cooling and trap-
ping methods made ﬁltering almost obsolete for atoms.
For molecules, however, an eﬃcient ﬁltering technique
could be a simple and robust ﬁrst step towards the pro-
duction of a cold gas of molecules.

In this Letter we describe an experiment in which
the Stark interaction of polar molecules with an inho-
mogeneous, electrostatic ﬁeld is exploited to eﬃciently
guide slow molecules out of a room-temperature reser-
voir. Whether a dipolar molecule is weak-ﬁeld seeking
and trapped by an electric ﬁeld minimum, or strong-ﬁeld
seeking and expelled, depends on whether the average
orientation of the rotating molecular dipole is antipar-

allel or parallel to the local electric ﬁeld, respectively.
Weak ﬁeld seeking molecules are trapped if their kinetic
energy is less than the Stark potential barrier for them.
Thus a linear, static quadrupolar potential forms a two-
dimensional trap for molecules with small transverse ve-
locity components with respect to the quadrupole axis.
This allows one to guide molecules out of a reservoir into
a vacuum.
In a linear guide, transverse and longitu-
dinal components of the velocity are completely decou-
pled. The longitudinal velocity of the molecules is lim-
ited by guiding them around a bend in the quadrupole,
downstream from the reservoir. The centripetal force
due to the electric ﬁeld gradient guides only the slowest
molecules around the bend. The fast molecules escape
the guide and are pumped away.

Important parameters for characterizing such a contin-
uous source of slow molecules are the velocity distribution
and the ﬂux of the molecules. For a given molecular state,
we have a maximum transverse (vtmax) and longitudinal
(vlmax) velocity that will be guided. Under the assump-
tions that the Stark shift of the molecule is linear with
electric ﬁeld and that the longitudinal (vl) and transverse
(vt) velocities are much smaller than the mean thermal
velocity inside the reservoir, the ﬂux Φ in the guide is

where E is the depth-determining electric ﬁeld strength.
Eq. (1) is valid for every molecule with a linear Stark
state, and therefore also for an ensemble of molecules
with diﬀerent, but linear, Stark shifts. The derivation of
Eq. (1) utilizes a unique property of the guide, namely,
that the longitudinal velocity distribution has a linear
dependence on velocity for small velocities: Φ(vl) ∝
l /α2], in contrast to molecular beams, which
vl exp[−v2
have a v3
l /α2] dependence. The reason is that
l exp[−v2
the guide selects on kinetic energy, not on angle as in a
typical molecular beam, which is collimated by apertures.
As a consequence, molecules that are slow in axial and
radial direction will still be guided, whereas they would
be lost in a molecular beam.

Most of our experiments are performed with formalde-
hyde (H2CO), which has a relatively large dipole moment

of 2.34 Debye and is one of the best studied 4-atomic
asymmetric-top molecules. At room temperature (300 K)
almost all the H2CO molecules will be in the vibrational
ground state. A large number of rotational states is pop-
ulated, however. The experiment itself (see Fig. 1a) con-
sists of the bent quadrupolar guide starting at a 0.5 mm
diameter ceramic nozzle and ending in a UHV detection
chamber, passing through a vacuum chamber where the
ﬁltering is performed. The guide has a length of 18 cm
and is made of 1 mm diameter stainless steel rods, with a
1 mm gap between neighboring rods. The rods are built
around the ceramic nozzle. Typical operation pressures
in the nozzle, which injects the molecules directly into
the quadrupole, are below 0.05 mbar in order to main-
tain molecular ﬂow conditions. Most of the molecules are
not guided and escape into the vacuum chamber, where
a typical operational pressure of a few times 10−7 mbar
is maintained by a 500 l/s turbo-molecular pump. The
90◦ bent section of the guide is about 60 mm downstream
from the nozzle and its radius of curvature is 13.5 mm.
After the bend, the guide passes through a 5 cm long and
4 mm narrow tube for diﬀerential pumping before enter-
ing the detection chamber, where a 56 l/s turbo pump
maintains a pressure of ≈ 2 × 10−9 mbar. The guide
abruptly ends 25 mm before the ionization volume of a
quadrupole mass spectrometer (QMS) [Pfeiﬀer vacuum,
Prisma QMA 200]. Apart from measuring the direct ﬂux,
the QMS monitors the residual gas in the detection cham-
ber. Standard pressure gauges are used to monitor the
pressure in the UHV chamber.

To interpret experimental results, a Monte Carlo simu-
lation was performed. As the depth of the guide critically
depends on the edge electric ﬁelds, the electric ﬁeld in a
90◦-bent quadrupole with short straight sections before
and after the bend was calculated numerically in 3 dimen-
sions. As an input one needs the angle distribution of the
molecules injected into the guide. This is diﬃcult to es-
tablish, because the slow molecules that we are interested
in will already be deﬂected by the electric ﬁeld in the
nozzle. A simple estimate shows that guidable molecules
emerging from the tube-like nozzle must have desorbed
from the wall no deeper than 3 mm from the exit. There-
fore, particles were injected into the guide randomly, ac-

2

cording to a thermal speed distribution, with an angle
distribution expected behind a 3 mm deep ﬁeld-free noz-
zle [12]. Next, for each molecular species, the Stark shifts
of the relevant states were calculated by direct numerical
diagonalization of the Stark Hamiltonian [13]. In the rel-
evant electric ﬁeld range (0-100 kV/cm), the majority of
thermally populated rotational states of H2CO and ND3
shows linear Stark shifts. These are gathered in a small
number (10-20) of groups with a similar Stark shift. The
trajectories under the inﬂuence of the electrostatic forces
were calculated by a Runge-Kutta method. The simula-
tion conﬁrmed the expected quadratic dependence of the
ﬂux on the electric ﬁeld, see Fig.2d). Moreover, the sim-
ulation yielded the overall transmission of the guide, the
velocity distribution inside the guide and the output di-
vergence and velocity distribution of the beam. Finally,
the simulation shows that the guide enriches the gas with
states having a large Stark shift.

signal, corresponding to gradual building of molecular ﬂux

age. (c) The ﬂux as a function of applied electrode voltage.

For detecting H2CO molecules the quadrupole mass
ﬁlter is set at mass 29, the strongest peak in the H2CO
mass spectrum. The inﬂuence of other gases at this mass
is negligible. The channeltron-ampliﬁed QMS ion cur-
rent can be tapped directly for transient measurements.

Alternating the voltages on the electrodes between the
quadrupolar ﬁeld conﬁguration and a non-guiding con-
ﬁguration with all four electrodes grounded resulted in a
modulated QMS signal, see Fig. 2. It was checked that
the electric disturbance from switching the high voltage
did not signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the signal apart from a
short spike of sub micro-second duration. At high back-
ground pressures of polar molecules in the ﬁlter chamber
and without injection of polar molecules into the guide,
the ion signal decreases slightly when the HV is turned
on. This eﬀect is attributed to a decrease of conductance
of the diﬀerential pumping section for polar molecules
in the presence of electric ﬁelds. The eﬀect is absent for
non-polar molecules. As a further test that the signal rep-
resents the direct ﬂux of the guide, a mechanical shutter
was installed that can prevent the direct ﬂux from reach-
ing the QMS. It is designed so that it hardly obstructs the
unguided molecules that emerge from the ﬁlter chamber
through the diﬀerentially pumped hole. With the shutter
blocking the direct ﬂux into the QMS, the modulation of
the QMS signal was a factor of ≈ 5 smaller. With the
above tests we conclude that the observed changes in the
QMS signal are due to real changes in the gas density at
the relevant mass.

FIG. 3: The longitudinal velocity distribution (data points
with statistical error bars) derived from data obtained
with an electrode voltage of ±5 kV. The smooth curve
is a (normalized) ﬁt to the data of the functional form
(2vl/α2) exp[−v2
l /α2], with α = 54 m/s, the stepped curve
is the Monte-Carlo results for 5 kV. The negative values at
high velocities are due to statistical noise in the data at short
times.

As a ﬁrst measurement,

the guiding signal was
recorded as a function of the applied voltage. The re-
sult, shown in Fig. 2c), shows the expected quadratic
dependence. In order to further characterize the source,
the rising slope of the signal was analyzed in more detail.
By using fast switches, the turn-on time of the high volt-
age is less than 1 µs, much less than all other relevant
time scales in the experiment. With the high voltage
oﬀ, the density of slow molecules that could in principle

3

be guided decays rapidly with distance from the nozzle.
Therefore, it can be assumed that the molecules arriv-
ing at the detector must have entered the guide after
the high voltage has been switched on. After a delay
of a few ms, which depends on the applied voltage, the
fastest guided molecules arrive at the QMS and the sig-
nal starts rising until it levels oﬀ after ≈ 10 ms. From
the delay and the rising slope, the longitudinal veloc-
ity distribution can be derived by diﬀerentiation. The
analysis incorporates the following additional inputs : 1)
the Monte Carlo simulation was used to estimate the
velocity-dependent probability of hitting the detector af-
ter emerging from the guide. This probability was used
to produce a correction factor. It accounts for the accel-
eration of the molecules when leaving the guide and the
fact that longitudinally slow molecules are more likely to
miss the detector, because they spread out over a larger
solid angle; 2) assuming that in the ionizing region of the
QMS the room-temperature ionization probability of the
molecules is of the order of 10−4, a velocity-dependent
ionization probability was calculated. From 1) and 2) a
velocity-dependent correction factor was calculated and
applied to the diﬀerentiated ﬂux data. Fig. 3 displays the
results for an electrode voltage of ±5 kV. Subtracting the
signal with the shutter closed had only a small eﬀect on
the velocity distribution, and was omitted. It should be
noted that the velocity distribution so obtained is rela-
tively insensitive to the exact ionization probability in
the QMS.

Note that for a single molecular state the velocity dis-
tribution should show a sharp velocity cut-oﬀ. But given
a mixture of states with diﬀerent Stark shifts, the cut-
oﬀ is smeared out. Surprisingly, this leads to a velocity
distribution which can reasonably well be described by
a 1-dimensional thermal distribution. For example, the
smooth solid curve in Fig. 3 represents a ﬁt to the data
with a temperature of 5.4 K. Note that the experimen-
tally determined velocity distribution is slightly narrower
than the one from the Monte-Carlo simulation, and that
the mean velocity is shifted to a smaller value. This devi-
ation is probably caused by experimental imperfections
such as surface roughness of the electrodes, deviations
from the design geometry, etc.

The transverse velocity distribution could not be mea-
sured directly, but from the simulations we expect for
electrodes at ±5 kV a transverse velocity distribution
characterized by a temperature of 0.5 K inside the guide.
After leaving the guide, the transverse velocity distribu-
tion is reduced even further to 0.3 K by the cooling eﬀect
of the spatially decaying electric ﬁeld outside the guide.
The absolute ﬂux was measured by calibrating the ion
current from the QMS with the background signal caused
by non-guided hot H2CO molecules. The partial pres-
sure of the hot H2CO was measured with the QMS and
related to an absolute pressure via a Penning pressure
gauge [Balzers, compact full range gauge PKR260], tak-
ing into account the relative ionization probabilities from
Refs. [14]. An ionization gauge [Varian UHV-24] con-

FIG. 4: The absolute measured ﬂux through our guide as a
function of nozzle pressure for an electrode voltage of ±5 kV.
The symbols are data points, the curve a guide to the eye.
For low pressures the gas in the nozzle is in the molecular ﬂow
regime and the ﬂux is linear in the nozzle pressure. Above ≈
0.02 mbar the mean free path for thermal molecules becomes
less than the nozzle length and collisions start playing a role.
As a consequence, the increase of the ﬂux slows down and
eventually the absolute guided ﬂux is reduced.

ﬁrmed the Penning gauge readings to within 50%. The
ionization volume is modelled by a (3 mm)3 box, as in-
dicated by the QMS supplier. Unfortunately, the exact
dimensions of the ionization volume are hard to verify
for our conditions. Therefore, we estimate a systematic
error in the absolute ﬂux of the order of a factor of 2.
The ﬂux that was calibrated in this way is plotted in
Fig. 4 as a function of the absolute nozzle pressure. The
H2CO content in the nozzle is approximately 12 %. In
Fig. 4, the nozzle pressure was deliberately increased to
a point where the molecular ﬂow approximation is no
longer valid. As can be seen in the ﬁgure, for low nozzle
pressures the ﬂux increases linearly, but starts deviat-
ing from the linear dependence above 0.04 mbar, reaches
a maximum of ≈ 9.5 × 108 s−1around 0.15 mbar before
actually reducing with pressure. This behavior is caused
by collisions. When increasing the pressure in the nozzle,

4

the beam characteristics change from an eﬀusive, thermal
velocity distribution to a distribution which is peaked to
a higher velocity. Moreover, slow molecules are kicked
away by the fast ones in the guide and by background
molecules. Therefore, it is important to keep the pres-
sure in the nozzle suﬃciently low.

From the Monte-Carlo simulation, the measured H2CO
concentration and the theoretical ﬂow impedance of the
nozzle, the expected ﬂux can be determined at a nozzle
pressure of 0.025 mbar and an electrode voltage of ±5 kV.
The result is 3.5 × 109 s−1, a factor of 10 larger than ob-
served in the experiment. The discrepancy might be due
to background collisions and, more likely, a non-perfect
nozzle and a non-perfect alignment of the detector and
the electrodes.

To demonstrate the general character of the source,
also a slow beam of deuterated ammonia (ND3) was pro-
duced, with similar results to those obtained for H2CO.
The deuterated species was used because of a null QMS
background signal from contaminants at the mass peaks
of interest and because its Stark shift is larger than that
of NH3.

In conclusion, we have experimentally demonstrated
a continuous, high-ﬂux source of translationally cold
molecules at temperatures of a few kelvin. The molecules
are conveniently delivered “on spot”, e.g. into an ultra-
high vacuum, where they can be stored in an electrostatic
trap. This simple and versatile method is generally ap-
plicable to all molecules with a reasonably large dipole
moment. By reducing the radius of curvature of the bend,
slower output beams can easily be achieved. In princi-
ple, the source can also be used as a novel kind of gas
chromatograph that selects polar molecules from a non-
polar buﬀer gas, or for enrichment of a gas with strong
low-ﬁeld-seeking states.

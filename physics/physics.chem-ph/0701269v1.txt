Abstract

Plateaus in water adsorption isotherms on hydroxylated BeO surfaces suggest sig-
niﬁcant diﬀerences between the hydroxylated (100) and (001) surface structures and
reactivities. Density functional theory structures and energies clarify these diﬀer-
ences. Using relaxed surface energies, a Wulﬀ construction yields a prism crystal
shape exposing long (100) sides and much smaller (001) faces. This is consistent
with the BeO prisms observed when beryllium metal is oxidized. A water oxygen
atom binds to a single surface beryllium ion in the preferred adsorption geometry
on either surface. The water oxygen/beryllium bonding is stronger on the surface
with greater beryllium atom exposure, namely the less-stable (001) surface. Wa-
ter/beryllium coordination facilitates water dissociation. On the (001) surface, the
dissociation products are a hydroxide bridging two beryllium ions and a metal co-
ordinated hydride with some surface charge depletion. On the (100) surface, water
dissociates into a hydroxide ligating a Be atom and a proton coordinated to a
surface oxygen but the lowest energy water state on the (100) surface is the undis-
sociated metal-coordinated water. The (100) fully hydroxylated surface structure
has a hydrogen bonding network which facilitates rapid proton shuﬄing within the
network. The corresponding (001) hydroxylated surface is fairly open and lacks in-
ternal hydrogen bonding. This supports previous experimental interpretations of
the step in water adsorption isotherms. Further, when the (100) surface is heated to
1000 K, hydroxides and protons associate and water desorbs. The more open (001)

hydroxylated surface is stable at 1000 K. This is consistent with the experimental
disappearance of the isotherm step when heating to 973 K.

1 Introduction

As a result of its low density, high melting point, nuclear properties, and
stability, beryllium is used in aerospace, ceramics, electronics, nuclear energy
and defense, metal recycling industries, dentistry, and even sporting goods [1].
Up to temperatures of 1534 K and pressures of 12 GPa, beryllium crystal is
hexagonal closed packed (HCP) [2,3]. In air, beryllium oxide (BeO) forms on
surfaces of beryllium metal[4,5]. BeO has been identiﬁed as an important com-
ponent of beryllium aerosol exposures that lead to chronic beryllium disease
(CBD), an incurable disease primarily of the pulmonary region of the lung[6].
Beryllium machining is likely to produce beryllium aerosol particles coated
with BeO. Aerosol particles deposited in the pulmonary region of the lung
are found in phagolysosomes within macrophage cells. In the low pH (about
4.8) of these macrophage vacuoles beryllium particles have been observed to
undergo dissolution[7]. Studies in rats suggest that beryllium oxide can cause
internal damage to macrophages which then aggregate and form granulomas
[8]. Animal studies [9,10,11] as well as dissolution experiments [12,13] suggest
that BeO calcined at 773 K (low ﬁred) dissolves faster and leads to greater
granuloma formation than BeO calcined at 1273K (high ﬁred). More soluble
beryllium compounds such as beryllium sulfate led to increased toxicity [14].
Understanding the solubilities of diﬀerent beryllium compounds is important
in determining risk factors for CBD as well as understanding the pathway from
inhalation to the disease. Sutton and Burastero have studied how beryllium
speciation and solubility is inﬂuenced by pH, beryllium concentration, and the
composition of the dissolving ﬂuid[15]. Since the mechanism of dissolution de-
pends on the surface structure, characterizing common BeO surfaces and their
reactivity is a useful ﬁrst step. In the present study, we characterize the typical
surfaces observed when BeO is formed by oxidizing beryllium metal and their
hydroxylation. Hydroxylation can occur upon exposure to water vapor in air
[16,17] prior to inhalation or at the latest when the BeO comes into contact
with water in neutral pH lung tissue prior to ingestion by a macrophage. In
a later study, we will consider the eﬀect of the acidic environment within the
phagolysosomes of the macrophage cell on BeO dissolution.

Beryllium oxide (BeO) is a Wurtzite crystal up to pressures of 137 GPa [18].
LEED experiments suggest that a six to seven monolayer BeO (001) ﬁlm grows
on top of Be(001). A new p(2
2) LEED pattern appears which suggests a
surface reconstruction [19]. Crystal growth experiments on both Be/BeO and
the analogous Zn/ZnO system suggest that when the metal is burned, needles

×

of the oxide appear. These needles grow into prisms. The top face of the prisms
is the (001) face while the side of the prisms is the (100) face. Water adsorption
studies on BeO crystals at temperatures below 973K show a plateau in the
adsorption isotherms. This plateau is linked to fast water chemisorption on
defect sites, followed by fast water adsorption on the hydroxylated (001) and
(00¯1) surfaces, followed by a slow water adsorption on the hydroxylated (100)
surface. Hydroxylation of the (001) and (00¯1) surfaces was expected to yield
fairly isolated hydroxyl groups which could readily hydrogen bond to adsorbed
water [16,17]. In contrast, hydroxylation of the (100) surface was expected to
yield a network of hydrogen bonded hydroxyls which would attract additional
water molecules for comparatively weak absorption.

The plateau in the adsorption isotherms becomes less pronounced as the tem-
perature rises until it is completely gone by 973K. IR spectra of the same
systems show a decrease in hydroxylation with increasing temperature un-
til there is no OH stretch signal at 973K and beyond. It is suggested that
surface rumpling at higher temperatures occludes the beryllium and disrupts
the hydrogen-bond network among surface hydroxyls [16,17]. The temperature
range below which hydrogen-bonded surface-hydroxyl network forms (973 K)
is in between the high and low ﬁred calcined BeO temperatures [9]. Basic
chemistry suggests that the hydroxylation structure of the diﬀerent BeO sur-
faces plays an important role in how the surfaces interact with water and
hence the dissolution process. The calcined BeO and animal studies suggest
that solubility is important to the formation of granulomas and development
of CBD [12,13,14].

This paper compares density functional theory geometries and energies for wa-
ter adsorption, dissociation, and the resulting hydroxylation on the (001) and
(100) BeO surfaces. These surfaces are exposed when BeO grows on Be(001).
Understanding hydroxylation of these surfaces is a prerequisite to understand
the dissolution. Section 2 describes the method used to calculate bulk BeO
lattice parameters. Section 3 presents the (001), (00¯1) and (100) BeO sur-
face cuts and relaxations. Water adsorption and dissociation on these surfaces
is discussed in section 4. Section 5 describes the hydroxylated surface struc-
tures. Finally, in section 6, our ﬁndings are discussed in relation to available
experiments.

2 Bulk

The Vienna Ab-initio Simulation Package (VASP [20,21,22,23]) implementa-
tion of density functional theory with the generalized gradient approximation
and the RPBE functional [24] was used for all calculations. The projector aug-
mented wave (PAW) potentials were used as supplied by Kresse and Hafner

3

−

[25,26]. Speciﬁcally, the valence states of Be:1s22s2 and O: 2s22p4 were used.
The actual occupancies are adjusted during the self-consistent ﬁeld electronic
cycles while maintaining the total number of electrons ﬁxed. K-point meshes
point shift. The cutoﬀ for the plane waves was
were generated using the Γ
400 eV. Electronic optimization stops when the total system energy and the
band structure energy of successive steps diﬀers by less than 10−5 eV. Projec-
tion operators were evaluated in reciprocal space. Electronic optimization used
the the special Davidson block iteration scheme implemented in VASP[27,28].
Gaussian smearing with a width of 0.1 eV was used. Geometry optimizations
used a conjugate gradient method. The geometry optimization stops when suc-
cessive energy diﬀerences are less than 10−4 eV. Ions, cell shape and cell volume
were varied. Precision was kept at the accurate level to avoid wrap around er-
rors for a very accurate bulk calculation. Bulk calculations used a primitive
a/2, 0),
mesh of 8
(0, a, 0), and (0, 0, c) were used in the optimizations. This corresponds to a
slab of dimensions a
c. The a and c lattice constants found were 2.71
and 4.39 ˚A, respectively. These values compare well with experimental values
of 2.6967(1) and 4.3778(1) ˚A[29].

3 (001), (00¯1) and (100) BeO surface relaxations

The total cell size (slab and vacuum) and shape are kept at their bulk values
while relaxing the surfaces. Additionally, the inner two BeO layers are kept at
the bulk geometry. The conditions for electronic and nuclear optimization are
the same as for the bulk unless otherwise noted.

As shown in Figure 1 (a), a cut through the (001) plane results in a non-
symmetric slab with a (001) surface on one end and the (00¯1) surface at the
other end. This gives rise to a dipole which induces a reconstruction when
the surface is six to seven layers thick [19]. As can be seen from Table 1,
a with vacuum-width of 14.76 ˚A is suﬃcient to
a six layer slab of area a
converge surface energies. Throughout this paper, the width of the vacuum
layer is deﬁned as the distance between the outermost atoms in the simulation
box surfaces along the z and x directions for (001)/(00¯1) and (100) surfaces,
respectively. An adatom is never considered as an outermost surface atom. The
(001)/(00¯1) calculations use a k-point mesh of 8
1 and dipole corrections.

Fowler, et al., [19] postulated a reconstruction of a (001)/(00¯1) slab where 1/4
of either cation vacancies or adsorbed anions form on the (001) surface and
the same number of adsorbed cations or anion vacancies form on the (00¯1)
side. The LEED pattern is consistent with the anion and cation additions
appearing in their normal lattice sites. The six layer a
a slabs used for
the surface relaxations only contain single beryllium and oxygen ions on each

2a. Comparing the relaxed
another requires a surface that is at least 2a

3a slab with a 19.15 ˚A wide vacuum layer yielded a relaxed surface
layer 3a
energy of 0.203 eV/˚A2 which is in agreement with the relaxation energy of the
smaller surfaces with a larger grid. This suggested that a 2
1 k-point grid
is suﬃcient for these larger surfaces. Optimizations were started from: (i) a
relaxed surface slab with 1/4 of the cations moved from the (001) side to the
(00¯1) side and (ii) a relaxed surface slab with 1/4 of the anions from the (00¯1)
side moved to the (001) side. The lowest energy minimum in both cases shifts
the displaced ions from their normal lattice sites to binding in three fold sites.
As seen in Table 1, the p(2
2)ii reconstructed surfaces have lower
×
surface energies than the unreconstructed (001)/(00¯1) surfaces. The lowest
energy reconstructed surface found is shown in Figure 1 (b). The exposed
(001) surface of this structure is consistent with the LEED pattern. However,
there is discrepancy on the unexposed (00¯1) surface. In the experiment, ions
are kept in lattice positions by the beryllium metal below. Since our system
does not have a BeO/Be interface the beryllium atoms are displaced from
their normal lattice positions to three-fold sites on the (00¯1) surface.

Table 1 also shows the surface energies of diﬀerent (100) slabs using k-point
c slab with 9.87 ˚A of vacuum is suﬃcient
grid of 1
for converging (100) surface energies. The dipole correction was negligible for
this surface. Figure 2 displays our relaxed (100) surface. The distortions from
bulk show the same trends as the previous calculations of Jaﬀe and Zapol[30].
For example, the distance between surface beryllium and oxygen atoms in the
relaxed surface structure is 1.50 ˚A in our calculations and 1.48 ˚A in their
calculation. The same distance for atoms just below the surface is 1.67 ˚A in
our calculation and 1.63 ˚A in their calculation. In both calculations, oxygens
occlude beryllium.

4 Water adsorption and dissociation

A water molecule was placed on each surface in a geometry intended to favor
bonding. After optimization of the initial structures, neighboring geometries
were sampled using molecular dynamics (MD) on the Born-Oppenheimer sur-
face with a time step of 1 fs and temperature re-scaling of velocities every 10
steps at 800 K. No equilibration was done. This is a sampling scheme similar
to forced bias[31], smart[32], and hybrid[33] Monte Carlo schemes rather than
a true dynamics. The Γ point and a 300 eV plane wave cut oﬀ was used in this
low precision sampling process. Water dissociation occurred within 500 MD
steps on the (001) surface. On the (100), after many trials a dissociation was

5

observed within 2000 MD steps. The geometries sampled were visualized and a
low-energy subset was chosen for subsequent conjugate gradient optimization.
The ﬁnal optimizations used the earlier 600 eV plane wave cutoﬀ and default
precision. (001)/(00¯1) and (100) adsorbate optimizations used 2
1 and
1

2 k-point meshes, respectively.

These optimizations revealed adsorbed and dissociated water conﬁgurations.
Water adsorbs on the (100) surface both with a water oxygen bonded directly
to a surface beryllium ion and with a hydrogen bond to a surface oxygen atom.
After several trials starting from a bound water, water molecule dissociation
was seen in a high-temperature trajectory. Other times, the water molecule
desorbed. On the (001) surface which exposes beryllium, only surface Be-OH2
bonds were observed. Water dissociated readily on the unreconstructed (001)
surface.

When a trajectory produced water molecule dissociation, the Nudged Elastic
Band (NEB)[34] method was used to ﬁnd the transition pathway. Six lin-
early interpolated images between adsorbed and dissociated water were used.
When NEB suggested intermediate minima, the minima were reﬁned and a
new shorter path NEB calculation was done. Once NEB was converged, climb-
ing NEB [35] was implemented to reﬁne the transition state. Table 2 shows
the system size and binding energies of water in the adsorbed, transition state,
and dissociated forms on (001) and (100) surfaces. All these energies are rela-
tive to the corresponding bare relaxed surface plus an isolated water molecule.
The dissociated product on the (001) surface is 2.57 eV lower in energy than
the undissociated bound water. The dissociation barrier is only 0.12 eV. In
contrast, the dissociation barrier on the (100) surface is 0.57 eV and the disso-
ciated product is 0.36 eV higher in energy than the undissociated bound water.
This explains why water dissociates more readily on the (001) surface than
on the (100) surface. The size of the (001) surface needed for reconstruction
made water dissociation studies on it computationally prohibitive.

Figure 3 shows the corresponding water adsorption and dissociated geometries
on the (001) surface. The transition state looks similar to the bound water min-
imum and hence is not shown. Figure 4 shows the water adsorption, transition
state, and dissociated geometries found for the (100) surface. Water dissocia-
tion on the (001) surface diﬀered signiﬁcantly from dissociation on (100). On
the (001) surface Be-OH2 loses a hydrogen to a nearby beryllium atom. The
hydroxide shifts to coordinate with a second beryllium. Bader analysis [36] of
the electron charge density suggests that a hydride and a hydroxide have been
1.06, respec-
formed, as the hydrogen and hydroxide charges are
tively. To compensate, there is a lower electron density among some of the
other surface atoms. When more waters are added, further hydroxylation is
possible. In this case, dynamic runs show hydrogen atoms combining, leaving
as hydrogen gas, thus giving a direct demonstration of partial oxidation of the

0.71 and

−

beryllium. In contrast, on the (100) surface, water dissociates into a hydrox-
ide coordinated to a single surface beryllium and a proton which binds to a
surface oxygen. Bader charge density analysis of the dissociated water on the
1.01 charge on the hydroxide and a +1.00 charge on
(100) surface reveals a
the proton. As can be seen in Figure 4, the dissociated conﬁguration permits
hydrogen bonding between the hydroxide oxygen and the adjacent proton.

5 Hydroxylated surface structure

Surfaces were fully hydroxylated as suggested by the dissociation patterns
seen in the molecular dynamics sampling. The hydroxylated surfaces were opti-
mized using the Γ point. From this conﬁguration, a sampling molecular dynam-
ics was started. Conﬁgurations from this run were then optimized. There are
in principle many orientations possible for all the hydroxide combinations and
this is by no means an exhaustive minima search. Nevertheless, Figures 5 (a)
and (b) show a representative hydroxylation structure for the (001) and (100)
surfaces, respectively. The (001) surface tended to form doubly-coordinated
metal hydroxide structures, and to lose hydrogen gas leading to a sparsely hy-
droxylated (001) surface. Additionally, once some doubly-coordinated beryl-
lium ions are produced, the chance for further hydroxylation decreases. Hence,
the surface hydroxylation was not homogeneous as seen in the sample conﬁg-
uration shown in Figure 5 (a). All the nonbonded oxygen/hydrogen distances
there are larger than 3 ˚A, i.e., longer than traditional hydrogen bonds.

In contrast, the tendency of the (100) surface to dissociate water molecules
into a hydroxide and proton on adjacent surface beryllium and oxygen ions
leads to a denser hydroxylation. On this hydroxylated surface, adjacent non-
bonded oxygens and hydrogens have distances in the range of 1.6 to 1.9 ˚A.
In addition, sometimes a row of adjacent hydroxides and protons associated
to beryllium bonded water, and occasionally more than one row associated in
that way. This is consistent with the hydrogen bonded network postulated in
references [16,17] to explain the step in water adsorption data.

Heating the (100) hydroxylated surface to 1000 K lead to proton shuﬄing and
association of hydroxide ligands with protons followed by water desorption of
several water molecules. The same heating of the (001) hydroxylated surface
left the hydroxylated structure unchanged.

6 Concluding discussion

Bulk lattice parameters agree with experiment[29]. Beryllium oxide prisms
with prominent (100) sides and smaller (001) tops grow on Be(001) [16,17] in
the laboratory. Consistent with this, a Wulﬀ construction [37,38] based on the
surface energies in Table 1 suggests that BeO crystals exposing (100), (001)
and (00¯1) faces exhibit a prism shape with large (100) faces and small (001)
and (00¯1) faces. Some synthetic crystals which expose these faces have the
same prism shape [39]. When BeO is grown on Be(001), the BeO(00¯1) face is
hidden by the Be(001). There are also alternative ways to make BeO crystals
which expose additional phases and exhibit diﬀerent crystal patterns [40,41].

In agreement with LEED experiments [19] where thin layers of BeO are grown
on Be(001), a p(2x2) lower energy reconstruction of the BeO(001) is found.
Nevertheless, our lowest energy reconstruction has beryllium in three fold sites
rather than at the standard lattice positions. This is likely a result of not hav-
ing a Be(001) substrate attached to the BeO(00¯1) surface in our simulations.
The (001) surface reconstruction is consistent with the experiment.

Water adsorption and dissociation reveals a reactive unreconstructed (001)
surface consistent with preferred BeO growth in the direction of the (001)
surface normal making more (100) surface. The preferred state of water on
the (001) surface is in the dissociated form. In contrast, on the (100) surface,
water prefers to physi-sorb. The size of the (001) reconstructed simulation
cells prohibited detailed study of water/surface reactivity on these systems.
Since the reconstructed ﬂatter (001) surface has beryllium only slightly higher
than oxygens, water surface reactivity is expected to decrease relative to the
unreconstructed surface. However, water reactivity should still be greater than
for the (100) surface where surface berylliums are below surface oxygens.

Extensive hydroxylation of the unreconstructed (001) surface does not allow
for much internal hydrogen bond formation. In contrast, hydroxylation of the
(100) surface lends itself to a hydrogen bonded network. This might lead to
a slower water adsorption until a new water layer capable of hydrogen bond-
ing to additional water is added. This may explain the step in the adsorption
isotherms. Finally, the hydrogen bonded network in the hydroxylated (100)
surface allows for signiﬁcant proton shuﬄing aiding association of hydroxide
and proton into water. Desorption follows heating to 1000 K. This is consistent
with the disappearance of the adsorption step and IR OH stretch signal fol-
lowing exposure to this temperature [16,17]. Nevertheless, in our simulations,
the surface does not appear to have a permanent change.

The presence of reactive surfaces such as the (001) here might explain the
high initial rates observed in dissolution studies[42], although dissolution of

8

BeO in aqueous media is acid catalyzed [43]. Therefore in suﬃciently acidic
solutions equilibration of surface structures should probably be expected after
an initial rate. Then a hydroxylated surface may be an obligatory intermediate
for the molecular mechanism of dissolution. Surface dehydroxylation at high
temperatures might be indicative of annealing that could explain the slower
dissolution of high ﬁred beryllium oxide compared to low ﬁred beryllium oxide.

Surface energies per unit surface area. Vacuum length is
deﬁned by the distance from the outermost atom on one
surface to the outermost atom on the other surface along
the z or x axes for the (001)/(00¯1), denoted (001), and
(100) surfaces, respectively. An adatom is never considered
as an outermost surface atom. p(2
2)ii are
the reconstructions moving: (i) 1/4 cations moved from the
(001) side to the (00¯1) side and (ii) 1/4 anions from the
(00¯1) side moved to the (001) side. See Section 3 for more
details. See Figures 1 (a) and 2 for pictures of the relaxed but
unreconstructed (001) and (100) surfaces. Figure 1(b) shows

The system size and binding energies of water in the adsorbed,
transition state, and dissociated forms on (001) and (100)
surfaces. All these energies are relative to the corresponding
bare relaxed surface plus an isolated water molecule. The
corresponding structures are shown in Figures 3 and 4,
respectively. Moving the hydride in the (001) structure lowers
the energy further.

List of Figures

(a) A 001 cut reveals two surfaces: The top (001) surface
viewed from the side features exposed Be atoms while the
bottom (00¯1) surface buries them. The (00¯1) surface is
adjacent to the Be(001) face when the beryllium oxidizes.
(b) As can be seen from a top view of the reconstructed
(001) surface, this lowest energy reconstructed surface has Be
atom vacancies (black circles) in the ﬂattened (001) face and
additional Be atoms at three fold sites (light grey spheres in
the center of hexagons) on the (00¯1) face. In all ﬁgures, the
small light grey and large dark grey spheres are Be and O,
respectively.

The (100) cut reveals two symmetric (100) surfaces. In this
relaxed surface, the surface beryllium ions are slightly lower
than the oxygens.

3 Water can dissociate on the (001) surface by ﬁrst binding to
a beryllium on the surface (a), stretching an OH bond in the
direction of a beryllium, and ﬁnally reaching a dissociated
state (b). The transition state looks similar to (a) and hence
is not shown. This dissociated state involves a hydroxyl, a
hydride, and some electron density reductions on the surface.
The white spheres are hydrogens. Multiple paths to this type
of dissociation are possible. This is a representative one.

4 Water can dissociate on the (100) surface by ﬁrst binding to a
beryllium on the surface (a), going through a transition state
in which the water hydrogen bonds to an adjacent oxygen (b),
and ﬁnally reaching a dissociated state (c). This dissociated
state involves a proton and a hydroxide.

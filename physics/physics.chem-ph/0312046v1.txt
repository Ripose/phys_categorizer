A hybrid mesoscopic multi-particle collision model is used to study diﬀusion-inﬂuenced reac-
tion kinetics. The mesoscopic particle dynamics conserves mass, momentum and energy so that
hydrodynamic eﬀects are fully taken into account. Reactive and non-reactive interactions with
catalytic solute particles are described by full molecular dynamics. Results are presented for large-
scale, three-dimensional simulations to study the inﬂuence of diﬀusion on the rate constants of the
A + C ⇋ B + C reaction. In the limit of a dilute solution of catalytic C particles, the simulation
results are compared with diﬀusion equation approaches for both the irreversible and reversible re-
action cases. Simulation results for systems where the volume fraction φ of catalytic spheres is high
are also presented, and collective interactions among reactions on catalytic spheres that introduce
volume fraction dependence in the rate constants are studied.

INTRODUCTION

The dynamics of large complex systems often occurs
on disparate time and space scales. The direct molecular
dynamics simulation of the equations of motion for such
systems is diﬃcult because of this scale separation and
the large numbers of molecules such systems may contain.
Consequently, mesoscopic models play an important role
in investigations of the dynamics of these systems.

The use of Langevin and Fokker-Planck equations for
Brownian motion is well known [1, 2] and these mod-
els have been used in much wider contexts; for example,
in investigations of reaction dynamics in the condensed
phase [3]. Such stochastic models are useful when it is
impossible or inappropriate to simulate the full dynamics
of the system, including all solvent degrees of freedom.

Suspensions of colloidal particles are also often treated
using mesoscopic models of various types. While the dy-
namics of the colloidal particles may be accurately mod-
elled using Langevin dynamics, hydrodynamic interac-
tions play an important role in dense colloidal suspen-
sions. The friction tensors that enter the Langevin equa-
tions depend on the colloidal particle conﬁguration. To
compute the frictional properties of dense suspensions,
the intervening solvent is often approximated by the con-
tinuum equations of hydrodynamics to determine the hy-
drodynamic interactions among the colloidal particles.

Other approaches for constructing mesoscopic dynam-
ics of complex systems include the construction of ef-
fective solvent models to be used in the context of full
[4] Such models allow
molecular dynamics simulations.

one to investigate systems of high complexity that can-
not be studied by straightforward molecular dynamics
simulation schemes.

In this article show how diﬀusion-inﬂuenced reactions
can be studied using a multi-particle mesoscopic dynam-
ics.
[5, 6] In this dynamical scheme, particle positions
and velocities are continuous variables and the dynamics
consists of free streaming and multi-particle collisions.
Multi-particle collisions are carried out by partitioning
the system into cells and performing a speciﬁc type of
random rotation of the particle velocities in each cell that
conserves mass, momentum and energy. The hydrody-
namic equations are obtained on long distance and time
scales [6] and the model permits eﬃcient simulation of
hydrodynamic ﬂows [6, 7]. Since the dynamics is carried
out at the particle level, it is straightforward to construct
hybrid schemes where solute molecules that undergo full
molecular dynamics are embedded in the mesoscopic sol-
vent. [8] Hydrodynamic interactions among solute parti-
cle are automatically accounted for in the multi-particle
mesoscopic dynamics.
[9] The method has been gener-
alized to treat phase segregating ﬂuids with surfactants.
[10]

Diﬀusion-inﬂuenced reaction dynamics is widely used
to model processes like enzymatic turnover or collision-
induced isomerization in complex systems.
Smolu-
chowski constructed a continuum theory for such re-
actions based on a solution of the diﬀusion equation.
[11] In this article we focus on the reversible A + C ⇋
B + C reaction where a considerable body of research has
concerned the development of reﬁned theoretical mod-
els [12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18]. Simulation schemes
[19, 20, 21, 22] for three-dimensional diﬀusive reaction
dynamics have been constructed. Diﬀusion-inﬂuenced
reactions taking place in a dense ﬁeld of catalytic parti-
cles are strongly aﬀected by perturbations of the diﬀusion

ﬁeld arising from reactions at the diﬀerent catalytic sites.
[23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29] This eﬀect is similar to the hy-
drodynamic interactions that enter colloidal suspension
dynamics. We show how collective eﬀects on diﬀusion-
inﬂuenced reaction dynamics can be studied by simula-
tions of a mesoscopic model for these systems. The meso-
scopic multi-particle collision model allows us to simulate
systems with tens of millions of particles for long times
in order to determine power law decays and non-analytic
catalytic particle density eﬀects on the reaction rates.

The outline of the paper is as follows. Section II
sketches the mesoscopic multi-particle collision model
and presents its generalization to multi-component sys-
tems. The evolution equations that encode the multi-
particle mesoscopic dynamics are presented in Sec. III.
The computation of the diﬀusion coeﬃcient, a necessary
ingredient for the analysis of reaction dynamics, is given
in Sec. IV.
In Sec. V we show how the model can be
generalized to treat chemical reactions. In particular we
study the reaction A + C ⇋ B + C that occurs upon
collision with catalytic C particles. The simulation al-
gorithms and simulation results for dilute and concen-
trated suspensions of catalytic spheres are presented in
Sec. VI. The conclusions of the investigation are con-
tained in Sec. VII.

II. MULTI-COMPONENT MESOSCOPIC
MULTI-PARTICLE DYNAMICS

The mesoscopic dynamics we consider comprises two
steps: multi-particle collisions among the particles and
free streaming between collisions. [6] Suppose the system
contains N particles with positions and velocities given
by (X(N ), V(N )) = (x1, . . . , xN , v1, . . . , vN ). While the
particle positions and velocities are continuous variables,
for the purpose of eﬀecting collisions, the system is di-
vided into L cells labelled by the index ξ. Collisions occur
locally in the cells in the following way: Rotation opera-
tors ˆω, chosen randomly from a set of rotation operators
Ω = {ˆω1, . . . , ˆωk} are assigned to each cell ξ of the sys-
tem. If a cell ξ contains nξ particles at time t and the cen-
vi(t),
ter of mass velocity in the cell is Vξ(t) = n−1
the post-collision values of the velocities of the particles
in the cell, v∗
i , are computed by rotating the particle
velocities relative to Vξ and adding Vξ to the result,

After the collision events in each cell, the particles free
stream to their new positions at time t + τ ,

xi(t + τ ) = xi(t) + v∗

i (t)τ .

(2)

This simple dynamics has been shown to conserve mass,
momentum and energy. The exact hydrodynamic equa-
tions are obtained on macroscopic scales, and the sys-
tem relaxes to an equilibrium Boltzmann distribution

of velocities.
[6] Consequently, the dynamics, although
highly idealized, has correct behavior on macroscopic
scales which are long compared to the eﬀective collision
times in the model. Since the dynamics is described at
the particle level it is a simple matter to couple this
mesoscopic dynamics to full molecular dynamics of so-
lute species embedded in it. [8, 30] The model is similar
in spirit to Direct Simulation Monte Carlo [31] but with a
diﬀerent discrete-time collision dynamics that simpliﬁes
the simulations and makes them more eﬃcient.

The mesoscopic dynamics for a multi-component sys-
tem can be carried out in a similar way by generalizing
the multi-particle collision rule. Suppose the N -particle
system comprises diﬀerent species α = A, B, . . . with
masses mα. In this case it is useful to introduce an opera-
tor Θα
i that characterizes the species α of a given particle
i. These operators have the following properties:

i.e., particle i cannot be of diﬀerent species at the same
time; also,

so that particle i has to have some species type. The
number of particles of species α is given by

i=1
X
There are many ways in which the multi-particle col-
lision rule can be generalized for systems with several
species and we consider one version that is consistent
with the requirements that mass, momentum and energy
be conserved. Let V(α)
be the center of mass velocity of
particles of species α that are in the cell ξ at time t,

In the model we adopt, two diﬀerent types of multi-
particle collisions occur. The ﬁrst is a collision that in-
volves particles of all species. To perform this collision,
we use a rotation operator ˆω which is applied to every
particle in a cell as for single component system. The sec-
ond type of multi-particle collision involves only particles

of the same species. The rotation operator ˆωα eﬀects this
collision and is applied to each particle of species α in the
cell. Not only does it change from cell to cell and with
time like ˆω, but it also changes from species to species.

The multi-particle collision process can be divided into
these two independent steps. For the set of particles that
are in the cell ξ, ﬁrst we perform the all-species collision
as

v′′
i = Vξ + ˆωξ(vi − Vξ) ,

(8)

where vi the pre-collision velocity of the particle i and
v′′
is the velocity after this step. Second, we apply the

From Eqs. (8) and (9) the post-collision velocity of a

particle may be expressed as

where L is the number of cells.

We may write the evolution equation in continuous
time by introducing a delta function collision term which
accounts for the fact that the multi-particle collisions oc-
cur at discrete time intervals. We have

∂
∂t

P (V(N ), X(N ), t) = (−L0 + C) P (V(N ), X(N ), t) ,

(14)
where the collision operator C acts on the velocities of
the particles at discrete times mτ , and is deﬁned as

m=0
X

CP (V(N ), X(N ), t) =

δ(t−mτ )( ˆC−1)P (V(N ), X(N ), t) .

(15)
If Eq. (14) is integrated over a time interval mτ −ǫ to (m+
1)τ −ǫ we recover Eq. (11) corresponding to multi-particle
collision followed by free streaming. Instead, integration
over the jump at t = (m+1)τ yields an analogous discrete
time equation with free streaming followed by collision.
Assuming that the system is ergodic, then, in view
of the conservation of mass, momentum and energy, the
stationary distribution of the Markov chain in Eq. (11)
is given by the microcanonical ensemble expression,

where ¯v is the mean velocity of the system, d is the di-

grate P0 over the phase space of all particles except par-
ticle i, we obtain the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution in
the limit of large N .

Figure 1 shows the results of a simulation of the ve-
locity probability distribution for a system with volume
V = 1003 cells of unit length and N = 107 particles.
The particles were initially uniformly distributed in the
volume V and all particles had the same speed |v| = 1
but diﬀerent random directions. To obtain the results
in this ﬁgure we assumed that the species were mechan-
ically identical with mass m = 1 and used the multi-
particle collision rule in Eq. (10) with rotations ˆωξ and
ˆωα
ξ selected from the set Ω = {π/2, −π/2} about axes
whose directions were chosen uniformly on the surface
of a sphere (±π/2 collision rule). This version of the
collision rule for mechanically identical particles will be
used in all calculations presented in this paper. The ﬁg-
ure compares the histogram of the x-component of the
velocity with the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution,

all species have the same diﬀusion coeﬃcient.) We have
computed D using this expression as well as the formula
for D in terms of the mean square displacement as a
function of the mean particle density per cell ρ. The
results are shown in Fig. 2.

IV. DIFFUSION

A knowledge of the value of the diﬀusion coeﬃcient
is essential for the analysis of diﬀusion-inﬂuenced reac-
tion kinetics. In this section we determine the diﬀusion
coeﬃcient as a function of the density from simulations
of the mesoscopic multi-particle dynamics and derive an
approximate analytical expression for its value.

The diﬀusion coeﬃcient is given by the time integral
of the velocity correlation function. For the discrete time
dynamics of the model, the time integral is replaced by
its trapezoidal rule approximation, as shown by a discrete
time Green-Kubo analysis.
[8, 30] Thus, the diﬀusion
coeﬃcient D is given by

D =

rule was used to obtain the results. The volume was V = 1003
and the temperature was kBT = 1/3.

An approximate expression for D can be derived by
assuming a single relaxation time approximation. If we

V. REACTIVE DYNAMICS

(29)

(30)

The A and B particles undergo both non-reactive and re-
active collisions with C, and the multi-particle collisions
described in Sec. II among themselves. The macroscopic
mass action rate law may be written as,

d
dt

δ¯nA(t) = −(kf + kr)δ¯nA(t) ≡ −kδ¯nA(t) ,

(32)

where δ¯nA(t) = ¯nA(t)−¯neq
A is the deviation of mean num-
ber density of A particles from its equilibrium value, and
k = kf + kr is the reciprocal of the chemical relaxation
time. We have incorporated the ﬁxed number density of
the catalytic C particles into the rate constants.

The microscopic evolution equation for this system
may be written by simply augmenting the free streaming
evolution operator in Eq. (12) with a Liouville operator
L that describes the interactions of the A and B particles
with the C particles. If the interactions of A and B with
C are through continuous potentials, L takes the stan-
dard form, L = F · ∇P, where F is the force between the
A and B particles and C and P is the vector of the the
momenta of the particles.

For the purposes of calculation and illustration, we
adopt a model where the C particles are ﬁxed in space
and have radius σ. The A and B particles either bounce
back from the catalytic spheres without changing their
identity or react with probability pR.
In this case the
evolution equation for any dynamical variable in the sys-
tem is given by

tively. The Liouville operators L± describing the reactive
and non-reactive collisions with the catalytic particles are

of the A and B particles with the catalytic spheres. For
bounce-back collision dynamics of the A and B species
with the catalytic sphere C, we have

The simulation of model is carried out in a cubic box
with sides LB and periodic boundary conditions. The
centers of the spheres of radius σ are located in this box,
taking care to preserve periodic conditions on the edges
when the spheres lie partially outside the cube. Once the
catalytic spheres are placed in the box, the initial posi-
tions of the particles are assigned values that are within
the cube but outside the spheres. The velocities are cho-
sen from a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution.

Given the initial distribution of particles and particle
velocities, the simulation begins by grouping the parti-
cles in cubic cells of size 1 within which the multi-particle
collision operators act to change the velocities of all par-
ticles, preserving their positions. Then the displacement
of each particle is computed using the post-collision ve-
locity, taking into account the periodic boundary condi-
tions of the cube and the bound-back collisions with the
spheres. When a particle hits a sphere it may react with
probability pR, and the sign of its velocity is changed.
Collisions between particles and spheres occur in contin-
uous time in the interval [t, t + τ ]. When many catalytic
spheres are present a particle may hit several spheres in
one unit time τ .

Once all the particles have been moved, the time ad-
vances one unit τ and the particles are regrouped to apply
the multi-particle collision rule again.

B. Single catalytic sphere

In order to test the utility of the mesoscopic model we
investigate a system that contains a dilute distribution of
independent catalytic C particles so that the dynamics
may be described by considering a single C particle (la-
belled 1) with radius σ in a medium of A and B particles.
In the case where A particles are converted irreversibly
to B upon collision with C the chemical rate law takes
the form, dnA(t)/dt = −kf (t)nA(t), where kf (t) is the
time dependent rate coeﬃcient. If the dynamics of the
A density ﬁeld may be described by a diﬀusion equation,
we have the standard partially absorbing sink problem
ﬁrst considered by Smoluchowski. [11] To determine the
rate constant we must solve the diﬀusion equation

inﬂuenced eﬀects arising from recollisions with the cat-
alytic spheres.

This equation assumes that the continuum diﬀusion
equation is valid up to ¯σ > σ, which accounts for the pres-
ence of a boundary layer in the vicinity of the the sphere
surface where the continuum diﬀusion description should

coeﬃcient is [34]

volume units and there is a sphere of radius σ = 10 lo-
cated in the center of the system. The simulation starts
with N (0) = NA(0) = 107 particles of species A with
unit mass uniformly distributed in the space. The initial
velocities are Maxwell distributed with kBT /m = 1/3.
The time dependent rate coeﬃcient starts at k0f and de-
cays to its asymptotic value kf . In our mesoscopic model
the continuum theory cannot apply on the scale of one
multi-particle collision cell, so we have taken ¯σ = σ + 1
to approximately account for the microscopic boundary
layer. One sees good agreement between the simulation
and diﬀusion theory results.

In Fig. 4a we plot the values of kf extracted from the
simulation data in this way versus the radius of the cat-
alytic sphere. The ﬁgure shows the increasing importance
of diﬀusion-inﬂuenced eﬀects on the value of the rate con-
stant as σ increases. While k0f grows quadratically with
σ in accord with Eq. (40), we see that kf grows more

which depends linearly on σ for large σ. The theoretical

the simulation results.

A similar calculation can be carried out for the re-
versible case (γ = 1 and pR = 1). For reversible reactions
the chemical relaxation rate k(t) is given by Eq. (43) with
k0f replaced by k0 = k0f +k0r = k0f (1+K −1
eq ) and, there-
fore, k−1 = k−1
D . [12] For our simulation conditions
Keq = 1 so that k0 = 2k0f . Also kf = kr. In Fig. 4b we
plot the simulation values of kf for the reversible reaction
and compare them with the diﬀusion equation formula.
Once again good agreement is found. The eﬀects of dif-
fusion appear at somewhat smaller values of σ since k0 is
larger for the reversible reaction and the diﬀusion-limited
value of the rate constant is reached at smaller values of

σ.

C. Random distribution of catalytic spheres

If instead of a single catalytic sphere we have a ran-
dom distribution of M spheres of radius σ in the vol-
ume V , the rate constant will depend in a non-trivial
way on the catalytic sphere density or volume fraction
φ = 4πσ3M/(3V ). The reactions at one sphere surface
will alter the A and B particle density ﬁelds there. From
the perspective of a continuum diﬀusion equation ap-
proach, since the diﬀusion Green function which couples
the dynamics at the diﬀerent spheres is long ranged, the
interactions from many catalytic spheres determine the
value of the rate constant. The problem is analogous to
the long range interactions that determine hydrodynamic
eﬀects on the many-particle friction coeﬃcient. There
have been a number of studies of the volume fraction de-
pendence of the rate constant [12, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28].
These derivations rely on resummations of classes of
interactions among the reacting spheres or other tech-
niques.

The chemical relaxation rate for a system with a ran-
dom distribution of catalytic spheres with volume frac-
tion φ is given by [12, 23, 24]

where, as earlier, k−1 = (k0f + k0r)−1 + k−1
D . The ﬁrst
ﬁnite density correction to the rate constant depends on
the square root of the volume fraction. This non-analytic
volume fraction dependence arises from the fact that the
diﬀusion Green function acts like a screened Coulomb po-
tential coupling the diﬀusion ﬁelds around the catalytic
spheres. As in the Debye theory of electrolytes, one must
sum an inﬁnite series of divergent terms to obtain the
non-analytic φ dependence.

The mesoscopic multi-particle collision dynamics fol-
lows the motions of all of the reacting species and their
interactions with the catalytic spheres. Consequently, all
many-sphere collective eﬀects are automatically incorpo-
rated in the dynamics. We have carried out simulations
of the chemical relaxation rate constant k(φ) as a func-
tion of the volume fraction of the catalytic spheres for a
reversible reaction with γ = 1 (K −1
eq = 1) and pR = 0.25
as well as an irreversible reaction with γ = 0 (K −1
eq = 0)
and pR = 0.5. For this choice of parameters the theoret-
ical formula predicts that k(φ) for the reversible reaction
is equal to kf (φ) for the irreversible reaction. Our simula-
tions were performed for systems with a volume fraction
φ of catalytic spheres with radius σ = 3 in a system of size
1003 multi-particle cells and an initial number density of
A particles, nA(0) = 10 per cell. The results shown in
Fig. 5 were obtained from an average over ﬁve realiza-
tions of the random distribution of catalytic spheres. We
see that the simulation results conﬁrm the existence of a

φ1/2 dependence on the volume fraction for small volume
fractions. As predicted by the theory for the chosen pa-
rameter values the reversible and irreversible data over-
lap, even in the high volume fraction regime. For larger
volume fractions the results deviate from the predictions
of Eq. (44) and the rate constant depends much more
strongly on the volume fraction. In this regime the dif-
fusion coeﬃcient is also modiﬁed as a result of collisions
with the catalytic spheres and this eﬀect also contributes
to the deviation.

From these results we conclude that the mesoscopic
multi-particle collision dynamics provides a powerful tool
for the exploration of concentration eﬀects on diﬀusion-
inﬂuenced reaction kinetics. Such concentration depen-
dence is often diﬃcult to explore by other means.

VII. CONCLUSION

We have demonstrated that large-scale simulations of
diﬀusion-inﬂuenced reaction kinetics are possible by us-
ing the mesoscopic multi-particle collision model. With
this model the dynamics of tens of millions of particles
interacting with hundreds of catalytic spheres could be
followed for long times to obtain the rate constants char-
acterizing the population decay. Such simulations would
be very costly using full molecular dynamics methods.

Since the dynamics is followed at the (mesoscopic) par-
ticle level, a number of noteworthy features of the dy-
namical scheme are worth mentioning. From a technical
point of view the dynamics is stable and no diﬃculties
like those associated with discretizations of the diﬀusion
equation or boundary conditions arise. Reversible and

irreversible reaction kinetics may be treated in similar
fashion. All details of interactions arising from compe-
tition among the catalytic spheres in a dense suspension
are automatically taken into account; thus, screening ef-
fects enter naturally in the dynamics.

The model may be generalized to any reaction scheme
and is not restricted to the simple A + C ⇋ B + C re-
action with catalytic C particles discussed in this paper.
Since solute molecules embedded in the mesoscopic sol-
vent evolve by full molecular dynamics (without solvent-
solvent interactions), the model will be most eﬃcient

when solvent-solvent interactions are a major time lim-
iting factor in the simulation. This could be case for
conformational changes of large molecules in solution, re-
actions involving energy transfer in solution, etc. Thus,
the model should ﬁnd applicability in a variety of cir-
cumstances when diﬀusion-inﬂuenced reaction kinetics is
important.

Quantum-mechanical close-coupling calculations for state-to-state cross sections and thermal rates are reported
for H2+H2 collisions. Two recently developed potential energy surfaces (PES) for the H2−H2 system are applied,
namely, the global potential surface from the work of A.I. Boothroyd, P.G. Martin, W.J. Keogh, M.J. Peterson,
J. Chem. Phys., 116 (2002) 666, and a restricted, model surface from the works of P. Diep, J.K. Johnson, J.
Chem. Phys., 113 (2000) 3480; ibid. 112, 4465. The low temperature limit is investigated. We found signiﬁcant
diﬀerences in cross sections and corresponding thermal rates calculated with these two PESs.

1. Introduction

The investigation of elastic and inelastic colli-
sions between molecules and between molecules
and atoms can provide valuable information
about interactions, chemical properties and en-
ergy transfer dynamics [1-15]. The hydrogen
molecule is the simplest and most abundant
molecule in the universe’s molecular clouds and
plays an important role in many areas of as-
trophysics. For example, knowledge of the ro-
vibrational excitation and de-excitation rate con-
stants in molecular hydrogen collisions is of
fundamental importance for understanding and
modeling the energy balance in the interstellar
medium. The energy transfer processes involv-
ing H2 molecules control the evolution of shock
fronts and photodissociation regions (PDRs) in
the interstellar medium. Additionally, the en-
ergy transfer between H2 molecules and between
H2 and other atoms/molecules is important for
cooling of primordial gas and shock wave-induced
heating in the interstellar media. However, to
accurately model the thermal balance and kinet-
ics of such important systems one needs accurate
state-to-state rate constants kvjv′j′ (T ).

Experimental measurement of quantum state
resolved cross sections and rates is a very diﬃcult
technical problem. On the other hand, accurate
theoretical data requires precise potential energy

surfaces and reliable dynamical treatment of the
collision processes. The ﬁrst attempt to construct
a realistic full-dimensional ab initio PES for the
H2−H2 system was done in works [3], and the
potential was widely used in a variaty of methods
and computation techniques.

Recently the H2−H2 system has been reinvesti-
gated and an accurate interaction potential from
the ﬁrst principles has been developed in work
[12]. However, in this work the Diep and Johnson
potential energy surface (DJ PES) was extrapo-
lated only for the rigid rotor monomer model of
H2−H2.

An extensive study of the H2−H2 PES has been
recently reported by Boothroyd et al. [13], where
the potential energies have been represented at
48180 geometries respectively with a large basis
set at the multireference conﬁguration interaction
level.

In this work we provide a test of sensitivity for
the new PESs for collisions of rotationally excited
H2 molecules

We apply only the new surfaces mentioned above.
The scattering cross sections and their corre-
sponding rate coeﬃcients are calculated using a
non reactive quantum-mechanical close-coupling
approach. In the next section we will brieﬂy out-
line the method. Our results and discussion are
presented in Section 3.

2. Method

In this section we provide a brief outline of
the quantum-mechanical close-coupling approach
used in our calculations. All relevant details
have been developed in works [1]. The hydrogen
molecules are treated as linear rigid rotors. The
model has been applied in few previous works, see
for example [1,4]. For the considered range of ki-
netic energies of astrophysical interest the rotor
model is considered to be adequate [14].

The cross sections for rotational excitation and
relaxation phenomena can be obtained directly

The kinetic energy is ǫ = E − B1j1(j1 + 1) −
B2j2(j2 + 1). Here E is the total energy in
the system, B1(2) = 60.8 cm−1 are the rota-
tion constants of the colliding H2 molecules, J
is total angular momenta of the 4-atomic sys-
tem, α ≡ (j1j2j12L), where j1 + j2 = j12 and

The method was used for each partial wave until a

calculations.

3. Results

As we mentioned in the Introduction, in this
work we apply the new PESs from works [12] and
[13]. The DJ PES [12] is constructed for the vi-
brationally averaged rigid monomer model of the
H2−H2 system to the complete basis set limit us-
ing coupled-cluster theory with single, double and
triple excitations. A four term spherical harmon-
ics expansion model was chosen to ﬁt the surface.
It was demonstrated, that the calculated PES can
reproduce the quadrupole moment to within 0.58
% and the experimental well depth to within 1 %.

The bond length was ﬁxed at 1.449 a.u. or
0.7668 ˚A. DJ PES is deﬁned by the center-of-mass
intermolecular distance, R, and three angles: θ1
and θ2 are the plane angles and φ12 is the relative
torsional angle. The angular increment for each of
the three angles deﬁning the relative orientation
of the dimers was chosen to be 30◦.

The BMKP PES [13] is a global six-dimensional
two hydrogen
potential
molecules. It was especially constructed to repre-
sent the whole interaction region of the chemical
reaction dynamics of the four-atomic system and
to provide an accurate as possible van der Waals
well. In the six-dimensional conformation space
of the four atomic system the conical intersection
forms a complicated three-dimensional hypersur-
face. Because the BMKP PES uses cartesian
coordinates to compute distances between four
atoms, we have devised some fortran code, which
converts spherical coordinates used in Sec. 2 to
the corresponding cartesian coordinates and com-
putes the distances between the four atoms. In
all our calculations with this potential the bond
length was ﬁxed at 1.449 a.u. or 0.7668 ˚A as in
the DJ PES.

A large number of test calculations have also
been done to secure the convergence of the re-
sults with respect to all parameters that enter
into the propagation of the Schr¨odinger equation
[11]. This includes the intermolecular distance
R, the total angular momentum J of the four
atomic system, Nlvl the number of rotational lev-
els to be included in the close coupling expan-
sion and others (see the MOLSCAT manual [15]).
We reached convergence for the integral cross sec-
tions, σ(Ekin), in all considered collisions. In the
case of the DJ PES the propagation has been done
from 2 ˚A to 10 ˚A, since this potential is deﬁned
only for those speciﬁc distances. For the BMKP
PES we used rmin = 1 ˚A to rmax = 30 ˚A. We
also applied a few diﬀerent propagators included
in the MOLSCAT program.
Now we present our

for diﬀer-
ent rotational transitions in collisions between
para/para- and ortho-/ortho-hydrogen molecules
(1). Our main goal in this work is ﬁrst:
to
carry out complete quantum-mechanical calcula-
tions with new potentials for diﬀerent transitions

ond, to provide a comparative study and check
the sensitivity of the two newest surfaces for the
very important and fundamental H2-H2 system.
The energy dependence of the elastic integral
cross sections on the total energy σel(Etot) in
the H2+H2 system is represented in Fig. 1 (up-

2 = 3 rotational transitions (lower plots)
for both the BMKP and the DJ PESs respec-
tively. As can be seen both PESs provide the
same type of the behaviour in the cross section.
These cross sections are in basic agreement with
recent time-dependent quantum-mechanical cal-
culations in work [7]. However, our results show,
that the DJ PES generates about 30 % higher val-
ues for the cross sections relatively to the BMKP
PES.

1 = 2, j′

1j′

Also, it is important to point out here, that for

4

R.A. Sultanov and D. Guster

comparison purposes we don’t include the com-
pensating factor of 2 mentioned in [2]. However,
in Fig. 2 (left plot) and in our subsequent calcula-
tions of the thermal rate coeﬃcients, kjj′ (T ), the
factor is included.

Signiﬁcant diﬀerences in the cross sections of
the two potentials are reﬂected in the state-
resolved transition states j1 = 0, j2 = 0 → j′
1 =
2, j′
2 = 0, as shown in Fig. 2 (right panel). That is
why it seems that the DJ PES can provide much
better results, as seen in the same ﬁgure in the left
panel. Speciﬁcally, when we present the results
for the corresponding thermal rates k00−20(T )
calculated with the DJ potential together with
results of other theoretical calculations [4] and
[5] the agreement is almost perfect. Next, Fig.
3 provides the same results for the cross sections,
but includes the details at low energies, together
with the corresponding experimental data from
[9]. Now one can better see the considerable dif-
ferences in these two cross sections. However, the
DJ PES is able to provide very good agreement
with experimental data [9]. Thus we conclude,
that DJ PES is much better suited for the H2−H2
system. Moreover, in Fig. 4 we provide thermal
rates for diﬀerent transition states calculated with
only the DJ PES and in comparison with other
theoretical data obtained within diﬀerent dynam-
ical methods and PESs. Again the agreement is
very good.

Finaly, Table 1 depicts the thermal rates
k00→20(T ) and k02→22(T ) at lower kinetic tem-
peratures, up to 10 K. Numbers in each column
should be multiplied by corresponding prefactor
P . As can be seen our results are in very good
agreement with recent experimental and theoret-
ical data at higher temperatures. However, at
T < 30 K we could not reproduce eﬀectively the
results of [9]. It may be because of the interatomic
(H2-H2) distance restrictions in the DJ surface in
which the potential ranges from 2 ˚A to only 10
˚A. It seems plausible, that for such low energies
one needs to carry out calculations even beyond
the 10 ˚A limit.

tions and rates for molecular hydrogen collisions.

A test of convergence and the results for cross
sections and rate coeﬃcients using two diﬀerent
potential energy surfaces for the H2−H2 system
have been obtained for a wide range of kinetic
energies [11].

Our calculations revealed, that both PESs can
provide the same type of behaviour in regard
to cross sections and rates for diﬀerent transi-
tion states. However, signiﬁcant diﬀerences in
the cross section of the 00→ 20 transition have
been found. Also, it was already indicated, that
at even larger kinetic energies the DJ potential
overestimates relative to the BMKP surface the
cross sections and rates by about 20-40 % [11].

In conclusion, the results of these calculations
show, that additional work is needed to further
improve the BMKP PES, particularly the part
of the surface, which is responsible for the 00→
20 transition. We also found, as can be veriﬁed
from Table 1, it is diﬃcult to use the DJ surface
and carry out reliable calculations at tempera-
tures lower than 30 K.

Complete homochirality induced by the nonlinear autocatalysis and recycling

A nonlinear autocatalysis of a chiral substance is shown to achieve homochirality in a closed
system, if the back-reaction is included. Asymmetry in the concentration of two enantiomers or
the enantiometric excess increases due to the nonlinear autocatalysis. Furthermore, when the back-
reaction is taken into account, the reactant supplied by the decomposition of the enantiomers is
recycled to produce more and more the dominant one, and eventually the homochirality is estab-
lished.

Natural organic molecules associated with living mat-
stereo-
ters usually have two possibilities
structures, in a right-handed form(R) or in a mirror-
image left-handed form(S).1,2 These two forms are called
enantiomers, and the molecules are said to be chiral. Chi-
ral molecules are optically active to rotate the direction
of polarization of plane polarized light. From the en-
ergetic point of view, these two enantiomers can exist
with an equal probability, but the life on earth utilizes
only one type: only levorotatory(L)-amino acids (or S)
and dextrorotatory(D)-sugards (or R). This symmetry
breaking in the chirality is called the homochirality.

The origin of this unique chirality has long intrigued
many scientists.1 In order to ﬁnd the physical origin
of this homochirality, initial asymmetry in the primor-
dial molecular environment has to be created by chance
or engendered deteminately by external or internal fac-
tors, such as the parity breaking eﬀect in the weak
interaction,3,4,5,6 the asymmetry in circularly polarized
light,2,7 or adsorption on optically active crystals.8 Then
the induced small initial chiral asymmetry has to be am-
pliﬁed.

Frank has shown theoretically that an autocatalytic
reaction of a chemical substance with an antagonistic
process can lead to an ampliﬁcation of enantiometric ex-
cess (ee) and to homochirality.9 Many theoretical mod-
els are proposed afterwards, but they are often criti-
cized as lacking any experimental support.1 Recently,
asymmetric autocatalysis10 of pyrimidyl alkanol has been
studied intensively.11,12,13,14 The enhancement of ee was
conﬁrmed,12 and its temporal evolution was explained
by the second-order autocatalytic reaction.13,14 But only
with the nonlinear autocatalysis, chirality selection is not
complete and the value of ee stays less than unity. Here
we show that the complete homochirality is achieved by
the back-reaction to recycle the reactant. If the rate of
back reaction is small, it takes a long time before the
homochirality is achieved.

We consider a chemical reaction such that substances
A and B react to form substance C. Though reactants A
and B are achiral, the product C happened to be chiral in
two enantiometric forms; R-isomer (R)-C and S-isomer

(S)-C.

A + B ⇋ (R)−C
A + B ⇋ (S)−C

In the experiment by Soai et al.12 one provides a small
amount of enantiomers with concentrations R0 and S0 re-
spectively in the reactants of concentrations A0 and B0.
Instead of the open ﬂow system considered by Frank,9
we assume a closed conserve system such that concentra-
tions R and S at time t vary in proportion to the present
amount of the reactants A and B as

= kR(A0 + R0 + S0 − R − S)(B0 + R0 + S0 − R − S)

= kS(A0 + R0 + S0 − R − S)(B0 + R0 + S0 − R − S).

Here we ﬁrst neglect the back reaction from (S)-C or
(R)-C to A and B. Later, the eﬀect of back reaction is
shown to be very important in achieving the complete
homochirality.

The positive reaction coeﬃcients, kR.S, may depend
on the concentrations R and S, if the reaction is auto-
catalytic. We consider various cases step by step in the
following. Furthermore, for a simplicity reason we as-
sume that there is an ample amount of substance B, and
the reaction is controlled by the less abundant substance
A. Then by normalizing the concentration by the initial
concentration A0 + R0 + S0 as r = R/(A0 + R0 + S0),
s = S/(A0 + R0 + S0), the equation is simpliﬁed as

= kr(1 − r − s)

dr
dt
ds
dt

= ks(1 − r − s)

(3)

where the reaction rate coeﬃcient kr,s = kR,S(B0 + R0 +
S0) may depend on r and s.

Since both enantiomers are equivalent except the hand-
edness, the time evolution should be symmetric in r and
s. The chirality of the system can be brought about
through the asymmetry of the initial concentrations r0
and s0 of two enantiomers, (R)-C and (S)-C. In the fol-

lowing we study the temporal variation of the enatiomet-
ric excess measured by

easily solved as r/s = r0/s0 =const. The time evolution
is depicted in the ﬂow diagram Fig.1(b). The ﬂow is
radial from the origin and trivially the ee does not change
even as the reaction proceeds,

Non-Autocatalytic Case
If the reaction is not autocatalytic, the reaction coef-
ﬁcients are simply constant as kr = ks = k. Then the
ratio of the two equations (3) gives dr/ds = 1, which de-
ﬁnes the trajectory in the r − s space. It is easily solved
as r − s = r0 − s0 =const. The time evolution of enan-
tiomers is depicted in the ﬂow diagram in Fig.1(a). The
ﬂow is on the line with a unit slope, and terminates on a
point of crossing the diagonal line r + s = 1; the reaction
stops because the reactant A is consumed up in a closed
system. The diagonal line r + s = 1 is in fact a set of
stable ﬁxed points.

Nonlinearly Autocatalytic Case
If the reaction is autocatalytic in the higher order, the
reaction coeﬃcient depends nonlinearly on the product;
for the second order autocatalysis, for example, kr = kr2
and ks = ks2. In this case, the ratio of two rate equations
gives

which is easily solved to give the trajectory in the r − s

evolution is depicted in the ﬂow diagram Fig.1(c). Below
the diagonal r = s, the ﬂow bends down, whereas above
the diagonal the ﬂow bends up. The ﬁnal concentrations
r∞ and s∞ should satisfy the relation r∞ +s∞ = 1. Then
the ﬁnal value of the ee is determined by the initial value

(c) Nonlinearly autocatalytic (d) with back reaction

FIG. 1: Flow diagrams in r-s space. (a) Nonautocatalytic,
(b) linearly autocatalytic, (c) nonlinearly autocatalytic and
(d) nonlinearly autocatalytic with backward reactions (λ/k =
0.1).

The ee decreases since the numerator r − s in Ω re-
mains constant whereas the denominator r + s increases
in time. Actually, the equation is easily solved, and ee is
obtained as Ω = (r0 − s0)/(1 − (1 − r0 − s0)e−2kt). The
ee decreases from the initial value Ω0 = (r0 −s0)/(r0 +s0)
to the asymptotic value Ω∞ = r0 − s0, which should be
very small if the initial amounts r0 = R0/(A0 + R0 + S0)
and s0 = S0/(A0 + R0 + S0) are small. This corresponds
to racemic mixtures.

Linearly Autocatalytic Case
If the reaction is autocatalytic in the ﬁrst order, the
reaction coeﬃcient is linearly proportional to the product
concentrations as kr = kr and ks = ks. In this case, the
ratio of two rate equations gives dr/ds = r/s, which is

If one starts with very small values of r0 and s0, the ee
approaches |Ω∞| ≈ 1−r0(1−Ω0)/|Ω0|. The ampliﬁcation
of ee is expected to be large if the initial composition r0
and s0 are small. For example, with the same initial ee as
Ω0 = 2%, if one starts with r0 = 0.051 and s0 = 0.049,
the ﬁnal ee is Ω∞ = 19% according to eq.(6), whereas
with the initial values r0 = 0.00051 and s0 = 0.00049,
then Ω∞ = 98%.

Homochirality by Back Reaction
From the previous analysis we found that the ee am-
pliﬁcation takes place with a nonlinear or higher-order
autocatalytic chemical reaction. However, the ﬁnal chi-
rality is not complete. The ee is smaller than 100%, even
the starting values r0 and s0 are very small. Here we
show that the inclusion of the back reaction from the
products (R)-C and (S)-C to A brings about the drastic
change in the ﬂow diagram.

A simple back reaction process is incorporated into the

rate equation (3) as

dr

= kr2(1 − r − s) − λr

with a rate constant λ of the back reaction. Now the
ﬂow diagram in r − s space changes from Fig.1(c) to (d).

The diagonal line r + s = 1 is no more a set of inﬁnitely
many stable ﬁxed points. Instead, there are seven ﬁxed
points in the ﬂow diagram, Fig.1(d). The trivial ﬁxed
point at the origin O:(ro, so) = (0, 0) is stable. On the r-
axis there are two ﬁxed points; U1:(1 −

If the rate of back reaction λ is small, U1,2,3 are close
p
to the origin O, and U4 and S1,2 are close to the diagonal
line r + s = 1. Then the ﬂow diagram looks similar to
Fig.1(c). However, there is a big diﬀerence in the ﬂow
diagram Fig.1(c) and (d). In Fig.1(c) the diagonal line
r + s = 1 is a set of inﬁnitely many ﬁxed points. On this
line, neither r nor s varies in time. On the contrary, in
Fig.1(d) there are only three stable ﬁxed points; O and
S1,2. The trivial ﬁxed point O corresponds to the struc-
tureless or lifeless world, without the chemicals (R)-C or
(S)-C. Its basin of attraction is a small region enclosed
by curves connecting O and U1,2,3. If the the priomor-
dial environment allows some chemical system to reach
exterior of this basin, chemical complexes with chirality
can be produced. The nonlinear autocatalysis ampliﬁes
the ee, and afterwards the back reaction process selects
only one type of a chiral component.

FIG. 2: Autocatalytic evolution of concentrations r (contin-
uous curve) and s (broken curves) of two enantiomers with
(λ = 2 × 10−4) and without (λ = 0) back reaction.

The time evolution of the concentration of each com-
ponent r and s is depicted in Fig.2. The initial ee is
as small as Ω0 = 0.01% with r0 = 0.00050005 and
s0 = 0.00049995. If there is no back reaction (λ = 0),
then in the early stage reactant concentrations increase

3

as r ≈ r0/(1 − r0t) and s ≈ s0/(1 − s0t), and tend
to diverge at times 1/r0 and 1/s0 respectively. Before
the divergence, the shortage of the reactant A leads to
the saturation of r and s, as r ≈ r∞(1 − e−2kt) and
s ≈ s∞(1 − e−2kt). The ﬁnal amounts r∞ and s∞ are
ﬁnite and nonzero. The ee is ampliﬁed to Ω∞ =7.9%
which is less than unity.

If there is a small but a ﬁnite back reaction process
with λ = 0.0002, both r and s increase again and ap-
proach close to the values corresponding to the unstable
ﬁxed point U4. Then the component which has a slight
advantage, r in Fig.2, starts to dominate, and the other
chiral type extinguishes gradually. The substance (S)-C
decomposes and supplies the reactant A which is con-
summed to increase its enatiomer (R)-C. The reactant A
is, so to say, recycled. Eventually, the complete homochi-
rality with Ω =100% is achieved.

We have shown theoretically that in a closed chemical
system, the nonlinear autocatalysis ampliﬁes the initial
small enantiometric excess. But eventually, the simple
back reaction promotes the decomposition of less abun-
dant enantiomer to the reactant, which is recycled to
produce the more abundant type. Through this recycling
process, the complete homochirality can be achieved.

The ratio of the forward and the backward reaction
rates, k and λ, is related to the equilibrium concentra-
tion or the yield. Therefore, a system with a yield less
than unity might have suﬃciently large back reaction rate
to achieve complete homochirality in experimental time
scales. But if the rate of back reaction is too large and
the forward reaction is autocatalytic, the system might
be trapped into the basin of attraction of the origin and
the reaction can not proceed. On the contrary, when
the rate of back reaction is too small, the enatiometric
ampliﬁcation can take place, but the ﬁnal selection of chi-
rality should take a long time. This might be the reason
that the previous experiments by Soai et al.13,14 are well
ﬁtted by a model with only the forward autocatalytic re-
action. To observe the eﬀect of back reaction, one might
have to wait a long time, depending on the back-reaction
rate. Otherwise one has to search appropriate chemical
systems with proper reaction constants.

If one considers spatial dependence of the chemical re-
action, further complications arise in the process of chi-
rality selection. Initial productions of enantiomers actu-
ally take place randomly in space and time. The nonlin-
ear autocatalysis promotes the chemical reaction around
these initial enantiomers, and the reaction fronts propa-
gate and expand. When fronts of diﬀerent enantiomers
meet with each other, the competition should take place
between them. This competition of enantiomers in space
is an interesting future research subject.

Introduction

The study of molecular vibrational spectra [1] requires theoretical models in order to analyze and interpret
the measurements. These models range from simple parametrizations of the energy levels, such as the
Dunham expansion [2], to ab initio calculations, where solutions of the Schr¨odinger equation in diﬀerent
approximations are sought [3, 4, 5, 6]. In general, the latter involve the use of internal coordinates and the
evaluation of force ﬁeld constants associated to derivatives at the potential minima. While this method
can be reliably applied to small molecules [7], it quickly becomes a formidable problem in the case of
larger molecules, due to the size of their conﬁguration spaces. New calculational tools to describe complex
molecules are thus needed.

In 1981 an algebraic approach was proposed to describe the roto-vibrational structure of diatomic
molecules [8], subsequently extended to linear tri- and four- atomic molecules [9] and certain non-linear
triatomic molecules [10]. Although these were encouraging results, the model could not be extended
to polyatomic molecules, due to the impossibility of incorporating the underlying discrete symmetries.
This diﬃculty could be surmounted by treating the vibrational degrees of freedom separately from the
In 1984 Van Roosmalen et al. proposed a U (2) based model to describe the stretching

vibrational modes in ABA molecules [11] which was later extended to describe the stretching vibrations
of polyatomic molecules such as octahedral and benzene like molecules [12]. Recently the bending modes
have also been included in the framework, which was subsequently applied to describe
2v-triatomic
molecules [13] and the lower excitations of tetrahedral molecules [14], using a scheme which combines
Lie-algebraic and point group methods. In a diﬀerent approach, it has also been suggested [15] to use a
U (k + 1) model for the k = 3n
3 rotational and vibrational degrees of freedom of a n-atomic molecule.
This model has the advantage that it incorporates all rotations and vibrations and takes into account the
relevant point group symmetry, but for larger molecules the number of possible interactions and the size
of the Hamiltonian matrices increase very rapidly, making it impractical to apply.

Although the algebraic formulations have proved useful, several problems remained, most important
of which is the absence of a clear connection to traditional methods. On the other hand, a related
problem is the lack of a systematic procedure to construct all physically meaningful interactions in the
algebraic space. In this paper we show that both these issues can be resolved by considering a symmetry-
adapted version of the U (2) algebraic model for the analysis of molecular vibrational spectra. In this
approach it is possible to construct algebraic operators with well deﬁned physical meaning, in particular
interactions fundamental for the description of the degenerate modes present in systems exhibiting high

1

degree of symmetry. The procedure to construct them takes full advantage of the discrete symmetry of
the molecule and gives rise to all possible terms in a systematic fashion, providing a clear-cut connection
between the algebraic scheme and the traditional analyses based on internal coordinates, which correspond
to the harmonic limit of the model [16].

3 , Be3 and Na+

As a test of the symmetry-adapted approach we discuss an application to three

3h-triatomic molecu-
lar systems, namely H+
3 , and to two tetrahedral molecules, the Be4 cluster and the methane
molecule. Since small molecules can in general be well described by means of ab initio calculations [17, 18],
we emphasize the basic purpose of this work. We establish an exact correspondence between conﬁgura-
tion space and algebraic interactions by studying the harmonic limit of the U (2) algebra. This general
procedure not only allows to derive algebraic interactions from interactions in conﬁguration space, but
3h-triatomic
can also be applied to cases for which no conﬁguration space interactions are available. The
molecules constitute the simplest systems where degenerate modes appear and where the new interactions
in the model become signiﬁcant. In the case of Be4 we present a comparison with ab initio calculations,
while for CH4 we present a detailed comparison with experiment. The application of these techniques to
other molecules, as well as a more complete presentation can be found in references [16, 19, 20, 21].

total number of bosons and is ﬁxed by the potential shape according to Eq. (4), while m, the eigenvalue of
the SO(2) generator Jz, takes the values m =
2)/2, . . . . The Morse spectrum is reproduced
twice and consequently for these applications the m-values must be restricted to be positive. In terms of
the U (2) algebra, it is clear from Eqs. (3-5) that the Morse Hamiltonian has the algebraic realization

In addition, the U (2) algebra includes the raising and lowering operators ˆJ+ and ˆJ−, which connect
diﬀerent energy states, while the angular momentum operator is given by ˆJ 2 = ˆN ( ˆN + 2)/4, as can be
readily shown.

where we have used the relation ˆJ 2

and anharmonic constants ωe and xeωe used in spectroscopy. To obtain this relation it is convenient to
introduce the quantum number

As a speciﬁc example, we consider the Be4 cluster, which has a tetrahedral shape.
3h molecules can
be similarly treated. In the Be4 case there are six Ui(2) algebras involved (i = 1, . . . , 6). In the present
approach each relevant interatomic interaction is associated with a Ui(2) algebra. The operators in the
model are expressed in terms of the generators of these algebras, and the symmetry requirements of the
tetrahedral group
acting on bond i can be
projected to any of the fundamental irreps Γ = A1, E and F2. Using the ˆJµ,i generators we obtain the

The other two commutation relations of Eq. (11) are not modiﬁed by the scale transformation of Eq. (22).
In the harmonic limit, which is deﬁned by Ni → ∞

[¯bi, ¯b†

obtain a geometric interpretation of algebraic operators in terms of those in conﬁguration space. In the
opposite sense, Eq. (22) provides a procedure to construct the anharmonic representation of harmonic
operators through the correspondence b†

where in the last step we used Eq. (24). The spectrum of Eq. (27) has an anharmonic correction, analogous
to the quadratic term in the Morse potential spectrum. We are thus substituting harmonic oscillators by
Morse oscillators.

A more interesting application is to use our model to ﬁt the spectroscopic data of several polyatomic
molecules. In the case of Be4 the energy spectrum was analyzed by ab initio methods in [17], where
force-ﬁeld constants corresponding to an expansion of the potential up to fourth order in the normal
coordinates and momenta were evaluated. We have generated the ab initio spectrum up to three quanta
using the analysis in [25]. For the algebraic Hamiltonian we take [16]

In Table I we show the the results of a least-square ﬁt to the vibrational energies of Be4 with the
Hamiltonian of Eq. (28). The r.m.s. deviation obtained is 2.6 cm−1, which can be considered of spectro-
scopic quality. We point out that in [25, 26] several higher order interactions are present which we have
neglected. Since our model can be put into a one to one correspondence with the conﬁguration space
calculations, it is in fact possible to improve the accuracy of the ﬁt considerably, but we have used a
simpler Hamiltonian than the one of [25, 26]. When no ab initio calculations are available (or feasible)
the present approach can be used empirically, achieving increasingly good ﬁts by the inclusion of higher
order interactions [16].

We note that the Be4 Hamiltonian of Eq. (28) preserves the total number of quanta V . This is a good
approximation for this case according to the analysis of [25, 26], but it is known that Fermi resonances
can occur for certain molecules when the fundamental mode frequencies are such that (V, V ′) states with
= V ′ are close in energy. These interactions can be introduced in the Hamiltonian but the size of the
V
energy matrices grows very rapidly, so the best way to deal with this problem is through perturbation
theory.

In Table II we present the ﬁts to the spectra of Be3, Na+

3 up to three quanta. While remarkably
accurate descriptions of the ﬁrst two molecules can be achieved using a four-parameter Hamiltonian, we
were forced to include four additional higher order terms in the H+
3 Hamiltonian in order to properly
describe this molecule. This is in accordance with the work of Carter and Meyer [18], who were forced
to include twice as many terms in the potential energy surface for H+
3 molecule. The

amplitude oscillations from its equilibrium positions [18].

respectively. The tetrahedral symmetry of methane is taken into account by projecting the local operators

it possible to eliminate the spurious states exactly. This is achieved by (i) ignoring the ˆT A1,b

basis from which the spurious mode has been removed following the procedure of [14]. We note that

automatically hold for states with higher number of quanta.

with a similar relation for the annihilation operators. From Eq. (37) the physical interpretation of
the interactions is immediate. The ˆ
Γx terms represent the anharmonic counterpart of the harmonic
H
interactions, while the ˆ
Γx terms are purely anharmonic contributions which vanish in the harmonic
V
limit. In an application to the ozone molecule it was found that these terms can account for the strong
anharmonicities and incorporate the eﬀect of Darling-Dennison type couplings [20].

The zeroth order Hamiltonian of Eq. (34) is not suﬃcient to obtain a high-quality ﬁt of the vibrations
of methane. Several physically meaningful interaction terms that are essential for such a ﬁt are not
present in Eq. (34). They arise in our model as higher order interactions.
It is an advantage of the
symmetry-adapted model that the various interaction terms have a direct physical interpretation and a
speciﬁc action on the various modes [16]. Hence the addition of higher order terms and anharmonicities
can be done in a systematic way. For the study of the vibrational excitations of methane we use the
Td

The interpretation of the ωi and α3 terms follows from Eq. (37). The Xij terms are quadratic in the
operators ˆ
Γx and hence represent anharmonic vibrational interactions. The gij terms are related to
H
the vibrational angular momenta associated with the degenerate vibrations. As mentioned before, these
interactions, which are fundamental to describe molecular systems with a high degree of symmetry, are
absent in previous versions of the vibron model in which the interaction terms are expressed in terms of
Casimir operators and products thereof [12, 14]. They give rise to a splitting of vibrational levels with
the same values of (ν1, ν2, ν3, ν4) but with diﬀerent l2, l3 and/or l4. Their algebraic realization is given

The Hamiltonian of Eq. (39) involves 23 interaction strengths and the two boson numbers, Ns and
Nb. The vibron number associated with the stretching vibrations is determined from the spectroscopic
constants ωe and xeωe for the CH molecule to be Ns = 43 [23]. The vibron number for the bending
vibrations, which are far more harmonic than the stretching vibrations, is taken to be Nb = 150. We
have carried out a least-square ﬁt to the vibrational spectrum of methane including 44 experimental
energies from [28]. The values of the ﬁtted parameters are presented in the second column of Table III
(Fit 1). In Table IV we compare the results of our calculation with the experimentally observed energies.
All predicted levels up to V = 3 quanta are included. We ﬁnd an overall ﬁt to the observed levels with
a r.m.s. deviation which is an order of magnitude better than in previous studies. Whereas the r.m.s.
deviations of standard vibron model studies in [14] and [29] are 12.16 and 11.61 cm−1 for 19 energies, we
ﬁnd a value of 1.16 cm−1 for 44 energies.

In order to address the importance of the α3 term, which is completely anharmonic in origin and
vanishes in the harmonic limit (see Eq. (37)), we have carried out a calculation without this term (Fit 2
of Table III). With one less interaction term the r.m.s. deviation increases from 1.16 to 4.49 cm−1. This
shows the importance of the α3 term to obtain an accurate description of the anharmonicities that are
present in the data. Similarly, the third calculation (Fit 3) shows that, in a ﬁt without the tij terms, the
r.m.s. deviation increases from 1.16 to 7.81 cm−1.

).
In addition, we have carried out a ﬁt in the harmonic limit (Ns, Nb → ∞

In this limit the α3
term vanishes and the algebraic Hamiltonian of Eq. (39) reduces to the vibrational Hamiltonian of [25],
the harmonic frequencies ωi and anharmonic constants Xij, gij and tij having the same meaning. The
r.m.s. deviation increases to 20.42 cm−1 (Fit 4). When we use the vibrational Hamiltonian of [25], which
contains one additional interaction (called s34 in Table III) the quality of the ﬁt does not improve. In
fact, the r.m.s. deviation increases to 20.90 cm−1 (Fit 5). The importance of the nondiagonal elements is
demonstrated in a calculation (Fit 6), in which the data are ﬁtted by the (diagonal) Dunham expansion
of Eq. (42). For this case the r.m.s. deviation is 21.00 cm−1, almost the same value as for the other
two calculations in the harmonic limit. The small diﬀerences in the parameter values and the r.m.s.
deviation of Fits 4 and 6 show that, unlike for ﬁnite Ns and Nb (Fits 1 and 3), in the harmonic limit the
nondiagonal contributions from the tij terms are not very important.

A comparison between the parameter values and the r.m.s. deviations of Fits 1–6 in Table III shows
that the α3 term and the anharmonic eﬀects in the interaction terms of Eq. (39) can only be compensated
for in part by the anharmonicity constants Xij. The r.m.s. deviation increases from 1.16 to 4.49 and
20.42 cm−1 for Fits 1, 2 and 4, respectively.

6 Summary and conclusions

In summary, in this paper we have studied the vibrational excitations of several molecules in a symmetry-
adapted algebraic model. In particular, for the methane molecule we ﬁnd an overall ﬁt to the 44 observed

10

levels with a r.m.s. deviation of 1.16 cm−1, which can be considered of spectroscopic quality. We pointed
out that for this calculation the α3 term in Eq. (39) in combination with the anharmonic eﬀects in the
other interaction terms plays a crucial role in obtaining a ﬁt of this quality. Purely anharmonic terms
of this sort arise naturally in the symmetry-adapted algebraic model, but vanish in the harmonic limit.
Physically, these contributions arise from the anharmonic character of the interatomic interactions, and
seem to play an important role when dealing with molecular anharmonicities, especially at higher number
of quanta. This conclusion is supported by our other applications of the symmetry-adapted model to
the Be4 cluster [16] and the H+
3 molecules [19], as well as our study of two isotopes of the
ozone molecule [20].

3 , Be3 and Na+

These studies suggest that the symmetry-adapted algebraic model provides a numerically eﬃcient tool
to study molecular vibrations with high precision. The main diﬀerence with other methods is the use
of symmetry-adapted tensors in the construction of the Hamiltonian. In this approach, the interactions
can be constructed in a systematic way, each term has a direct physical interpretation, and spurious
modes can be eliminated exactly. It will be important to further explore the scope and applicability of
the present approach. A more extensive study of methane including rotation-vibration couplings, states
with a higher number of quanta and transition intensities is in progress.

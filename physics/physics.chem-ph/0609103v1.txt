Abstract

A number of situations ranging from protein folding in conﬁned
spaces, lubrication in tight spaces, and chemical reactions in conﬁned
spaces require understanding water-mediated interactions. As an illus-
tration of the profound eﬀects of conﬁnement on hydrophobic and ionic
interactions we investigate the solvation of methane and methane dec-
orated with charges in spherically conﬁned water droplets. Free energy
proﬁles for a single methane molecule in droplets, ranging in diame-
ter (D) from 1 to 4 nm, show that the droplet surfaces are strongly
favorable as compared to the interior. From the temperature depen-
dence of the free energy in D = 3 nm, we show that this eﬀect is
entropically driven. The potentials of mean force (PMFs) between two
methane molecules show that the solvent separated minimum in the
bulk is completely absent in conﬁned water, independent of the droplet
size since the solute particles are primarily associated with the droplet
surface. The tendency of methanes with charges (Mq+ and Mq− with
q+ = |q−| = 0.4e, where e is the electronic charge) to be pinned at the
surface depends dramatically on the size of the water droplet. When
D = 4 nm, the ions prefer the interior whereas for D < 4 nm the
ions are localized at the surface, but with much less tendency than for
methanes. Increasing the ion charge to e makes the surface strongly
unfavorable. Reﬂecting the charge asymmetry of the water molecule,
negative ions have a stronger preference for the surface compared to
positive ions of the same charge magnitude. With increasing droplet
size, the PMFs between Mq+ and Mq− show decreasing inﬂuence of
the boundary due to the reduced tendency for surface solvation. We

1

also show that as the solute charge density decreases the surface be-
comes less unfavorable. The implications of our results for the folding
of proteins in conﬁned spaces are outlined.

Introduction

Hydrophobic interactions are presumed to be the dominant force in the
folding of proteins and the assembly of oligomeric structures.1,2 The nature
of hydrophobic interactions in proteins has been clariﬁed using experiments
which measure the free energy of transfer of amino acid side chains from a ref-
erence solvent to water.3 Indeed, understanding the nature of hydrophobic
interactions between small (< 1 nm) solutes has given a qualitative perspec-
tive on the major forces that render proteins (marginally) stable.1 Interac-
tions between small hydrophobic solutes have long served as model systems
in describing the balance of forces that stabilize proteins and peptides. The
distance dependent potential of mean force (PMF) between solutes, such as
methane, are quantitatively understood.4–7 The PMF is a measure of the
eﬀect of the solvent (water) on the mutual interaction between hydrophobic
solutes. The PMF between two methanes has a primary minimum at ≈ 0.38
nm4,8 that roughly corresponds to the distance of closest approach in the gas
phase. In addition, there is a secondary solvent-separated minimum at ≈ 0.7
nm in which the two methane molecules are separated by a water molecule.4
The barrier separating the two minima represents, perhaps, the desolvation
penalty that needs to be paid to squeeze out water molecules so that a stable
hydrophobic core can be created in the protein folding process.9,10

Although the nature of hydrophobic forces between small solutes in bulk
water is understood, relatively little is known about their interactions in con-
ﬁned droplets. The nature of water-mediated interactions between amino
acids in nanopores aﬀects the stability of conﬁned proteins.11–15 Several
experiments have shown that the stability of the folded state, compared to
the situation in the bulk, increases upon conﬁnement.16–19 In many cases
the conﬁnement-induced stability is adequately explained in terms of en-
tropic destabilization of the unfolded states.11–13 However, one can envision
scenarios in which alterations in hydrophobic interactions in conﬁned water
can also destabilize the folded state.20 The alteration in the properties of
conﬁned water are also important in the context of lubrication in thin ﬁlms21
and colloid science. Thus, in a number of applications the role highly con-
ﬁned water plays in aﬀecting solvation of hydrophobic and charged species
is important.

2

Motivated by the above considerations, we have calculated PMFs be-
tween two methane molecules in conﬁned spherical water droplets ranging
in diameter from 1 − 4 nm. Interestingly, we ﬁnd that for all values of the
conﬁning diameter D, the solvent-separated minimum is completely destabi-
lized because methane molecules are pinned to the boundary of the sphere.
In order to describe the competition between charged residues, which would
prefer to be fully solvated, and hydrophobic interactions, we have also calcu-
lated PMFs between Mq+ and Mq−. Here, one of the methane molecules has
a positive charge q+ while the other carries a negative charge. The extent
of destabilization of the secondary minimum in the conﬁned space depends
critically on the magnitude of the charges, q+ = |q−| and the ionic radius.
The possible implications of our results for protein stability in conﬁned ge-
ometries are brieﬂy outlined.

2 Methods

Models: We use Metropolis Monte Carlo22 simulations to study the ener-
getics of aqueous solvation of methane molecules and the model ions Mq+
and Mq− in conﬁned spherical water droplets. The droplet diameter (D)
ranges from 1.0 to 4.0 nm, and are bounded by hard walls. The potential
energy at the wall is large enough (1012 kJ/mol) that it conﬁnes the sys-
tem to the desired volume. To simulate conﬁnement eﬀects we do not use
periodic boundaries. Electrostatic and Lennard-Jones interactions are eval-
uated without a cutoﬀ. We use the TIP3P model for water23 and a uniﬁed
atom representation for methane.24 The Lennard-Jones (LJ) parameters for
these interactions are listed in Table 1. Model ions are created by adding
charges of magnitude q+ = |q−| = 0.4e or e to the methane spheres, where
e is the electronic charge.25
In order to assess the importance of charge
density in aﬀecting solvation we also study, for the 3 nm droplet, ions M*q+
and M*q− with q+ = |q−| = e and twice the volume of the methane sphere.
The parameters for their LJ interactions with water oxygens are given in
Table 1. Simulations are performed at constant number of molecules N ,
total volume V and absolute temperature T , and thus sample the canonical
ensemble. The simulations are carried out at 298 K and a water density of
997 kg/m3. We also simulated the D = 3 nm droplet at a temperature of
328 K with one methane, at the same water density.

The number of water molecules Nw, in each droplet, is calculated by

assuming that the eﬀective volume available to the water is

Vef f = V − NmVm

3

where Nm is the number of solute molecules in the droplet and Vm =
(4/3)πσ3
M O, is the excluded volume due to each solute. With the exper-
imental water density of 997 kg/m3 at 298 K and 1 atm pressure, we get
the number of water molecules Nw listed in Table 2.

Simulation details: We performed canonical ensemble Monte Carlo sim-
ulations with Nm ranging from 0 to 2 and the appropriate number of waters
(Table 2). Each system was equilibrated for at least 107 Monte Carlo steps.
Trial moves consisted of a random translation for both solute and solvent
molecules and an additional random rotation for solvent molecules only.
These were accepted according to the Metropolis criterion.22

The free energy of a single methane is calculated as a function of its
radial distance from the center of the droplet using umbrella sampling. The
PMFs between two methane molecules and Mq+ and Mq− conﬁned in these
droplets are evaluated using the same technique. We calculated the PMFs
using the weighted histogram analysis method (WHAM)26 with code from
Crouzy et al.27

We used harmonic biasing potentials, Ubias = k(r − r0)2, where r0 is the
center of each window and the spring constant k is chosen to be 5 kcal/(mol-
˚A2).28 Window centers are 0.1 nm apart in all calculations. Data sets consist
of 2.104 − 105 data points in every window. Each such data set is added to
the previous ones and the WHAM equations26 are iterated to a tolerance
of 10−4 − 10−5.27 The calculations are considered to have converged if the
addition of the last data set, with at least 5.104 data points in each window,
does not change the ﬁnal PMF signiﬁcantly. Typically, between 2.107 and
5.107 Monte Carlo steps are required to achieve convergence.

We adapted a standard method to calculate the radial distribution func-
tions g(r), for the conﬁned water. An inner sphere of radius ri = 0.5 nm
(0.2 nm for the smallest droplets) was deﬁned in each case and the g(r)’s
were averaged for all the waters inside this inner sphere. The normalization
is therefore accurate up to a distance of R−ri, where R = 0.5D is the radius
of the droplet. These functions go to 0 at a distance of R + ri, unlike the
case of bulk water where they converge to 1 for large r.

Excess chemical potentials µex, for TIP3P water were evaluated using
Bennett’s method of overlapping histograms.29–31 The histograms of water
insertion and removal (binding) energies required for this calculation were
collected in simulations with two methanes in each droplet with no biasing
potential applied to the methanes.

3 Results and discussion

We ﬁrst characterize the equilibrium properties of water conﬁned to a sphere
to discern the role of the boundary. The boundary should predominantly
aﬀect the layer of water molecules close to the surface.

Density proﬁles of conﬁned water: Water density proﬁles without methanes,

which measure the local density divided by the average density ρ0, in the
droplet (ρ0 = Nw/V where V is the total volume of the droplet) are shown in
Fig. 1. Remnants of layering, that are expected in the presence of the walls,
are apparent. Three layers can be seen for the droplets with D = 2, 3 and 4
nm that become progressively less well deﬁned as the droplet size increases.
The hard walls conﬁning the droplets induce a narrow region at the surface
in which the water density is substantially depleted - at the walls, the den-
sity is ≈ 60% of the average density, ρ0. This results in the scaled density
being > 1 far from the walls (Fig. 1). Conﬁnement in a droplet perturbs the
water structure and the perturbation becomes progressively weaker as the
droplet size increases. In the D = 1 nm droplet the local density is spatially
diﬀerent from the average density ρ0 at all values of r, the distance from the
droplet center.

Radial distribution functions for the conﬁned water (Figs. S.1 and S.2
in Supporting information) are identical to those for bulk TIP3P water23
in all important respects. Conﬁnement causes the g(r)’s to go to 0 at a
distance R + ri. In the case of the 3 and 4 nm droplets the g(r)’s are greater
than 1 for 0.7 ≤ r ≤ R − ri, the range in which there are no oscillations in
the functions and the normalization holds. This is due to the fact that the
scaled density (Fig. 1) is greater than 1.

Fig. 2a shows the binding (or removal) energy distributions for all water
molecules in droplets of diﬀerent sizes. The binding energy is the potential
energy required to remove a water molecule from the spherical droplet. As
the droplet size increases, the peak of the distribution shifts to larger nega-
tive values of U .
i.e. the waters inside become more strongly bound. The
distribution for the 4 nm droplet is almost identical to that for bulk TIP3P
water.30 By this measure, the largest droplets in this study are substantially
bulk-like.

Fig. 2b shows the same quantity evaluated for only the waters in the ﬁrst
layer (deﬁned to be 0.2 nm thick) closest to the droplet surface. The distri-
butions in Figs. 2a and b are virtually identical for the D = 1 nm droplet.
Thus, for small droplets there is essentially no distinction between “surface”
waters and water molecules in the interior. For the D = 2 nm droplet,
the two distributions in Figs. 2a and b are similar but not identical. The

5

distribution for the surface waters in Fig. 2b peaks at ∼ −65 kJ/mol, while
the corresponding one evaluated for all the waters in the droplet (Fig. 2a)
peaks at ∼ −70 kJ/mol - a diﬀerence of ∼ 2kBT , where kB is Boltzmann’s
constant.

For larger droplets with D = 3 and 4 nm, the surface waters are sub-
stantially more loosely bound than those in the interior. We also note that
the distributions for the surface waters (Fig. 2b) in the 3 and 4 nm droplets
coincide with each other. i.e. even though the 4 nm droplet is more bulk-like
than the 3 nm droplet (Fig. 2a), their surfaces are energetically identical.

Fig. S.3 (Supporting information) shows the probability distributions of
cos θ for surface and interior water molecules for droplets of diﬀerent sizes.
Here, θ is the angle between the dipole moment of each water molecule
and the position vector for its oxygen atom (the origin being at the center
of the droplet). Orientations of the interior water molecules are almost
isotropic. However, surface waters are preferentially oriented with their
dipole moments nearly orthogonal to the droplet radius.32 This implies that
a typical water molecule at the surface has one hydrogen atom pointing away
from the bulk, in the process sacriﬁcing its ability to donate one hydrogen
bond. This conclusion agrees with the results of earlier molecular dynamics
(MD) simulations of Lee et al.33 who probed the behavior of water near a
hydrophobic wall.

The D-dependent excess chemical potentials µex of TIP3P water are cal-
culated from overlapping histograms of water insertion and removal energies
(see Fig. S.4, Supporting information). As expected, µex decreases mono-
tonically as D increases and approaches the value for bulk TIP3P water
(-25.3 kJ/mol).31 However, even at D = 4 nm µex diﬀers signiﬁcantly from
the bulk value. It is clear that in equilibrium with bulk water, none of these
cavities will have an average bulk density ρB = 997 kg/m3. The presence of
the depleted region near the droplet surface implies that the average den-
sity inside will be less than ρB when the droplet is in equilibrium with bulk
water.

Introduction of methane molecules into the droplets results in some lay-
ering in the water around them. Fig. S.5 (Supporting information) shows
methane-oxygen radial distribution functions. i.e. probability distributions
of methane-oxygen distances P (r, dr), divided by r2/R3, where r is the dis-
tance between them and R = 0.5D is the droplet radius. Two water layers
can be seen around the methanes.

Solvation of methane: Fig. 3a shows the free energy of a single methane
molecule as a function of its distance from the center in droplets of diﬀerent
diameters. The position dependent free energy is evaluated using a har-

6

monic biasing potential to localize the methane molecules at diﬀerent values
of r, the distance from the droplet center. Each value for r corresponds to
a shell concentric with the droplet boundary. The ﬁnal unbiased probabil-
ity distributions (evaluated by WHAM, as described earlier) are scaled by
(r/R)2 before taking the logarithm and multiplying by −kBT to obtain the
free energy. Thus, these proﬁles do not include the 4πr2 contribution to the
entropy.

In droplets of all sizes the surface is more favorable for the methane
than the interior by ∼ 10 − 15 kJ/mol (4 − 6 kBT at 298 K).34 This value
is similar to the free energy diﬀerence of a methane at a water liquid-vapor
interface.35,36 In the largest and the most bulk-like droplet, the free energy
diﬀerence of ∼ 10 kJ/mol is close to the hydration free energy of a methane
molecule calculated from simulations and experiment.35 This supports our
view of the droplet surface inducing a vapor-like state of low density with
broken hydrogen bonds.37 In the 2, 3 and 4 nm droplets, the free energy rises
steeply from the minimum at the surface and reaches its interior value within
0.4 nm of the droplet surface and stays constant in the droplet interior. The
region with the steep gradient in the free energy coincides almost exactly
with the ﬁrst layer of water in each droplet (Fig. 1). In the smallest droplet
(D = 1 nm), there is no interior region; the free energy changes continuously
over the whole distance.

The preference of the methane for the droplet surface over the interior
can be understood in terms of the disruption in the water hydrogen bond
network at the surface. The presence of broken H-bonds at the surface im-
plies that the solvent has to pay a smaller entropic cost in solvating the
methane if it is conﬁned to the surface. In other words, there is less en-
tropy lost in reordering the hydrogen bonds in the immediate vicinity of
the non-polar solute. We attribute the larger free energy diﬀerences in 2
and 3 nm droplets to the greater distortion in water structure and greater
surface curvature in these droplets. Our interpretation that methane prefers
being localized at the surface is consistent with the observation that even
in bulk water small hydrophobic solutes occupy regions in which water has
the largest number of unsatisﬁed hydrogen bonds.34

From the temperature dependence of the free energy diﬀerence in the
D = 3 nm droplet, we infer that at T = 328 K the surface is more favorable
by about 1.2 kJ/mol compared to T = 298 K (see Fig. 3b). Estimates for
T ∆S (12.4 kJ/mol at T = 313 K) and ∆U (-1.8 kJ/mol) show that the
surface free energy is entropically dominated. Both the entropy and the
enthalpy are favorable at the surface of the droplet for methanes.

Potentials of mean force between methanes: Since the methane molecules

7

are conﬁned to the surface of the water droplets, their mutual solvent medi-
ated interaction will reﬂect the disruption in the water structure due to the
conﬁning walls. Fig. 4 shows the potentials of mean force (PMFs) for two
methane molecules in droplets at various D values. Compared with bulk wa-
ter,8 these show an increased tendency for the methanes to associate. These
proﬁles show only a single minimum at contact. Somewhat surprisingly,
we ﬁnd that the secondary, solvent separated minimum that appears in the
bulk proﬁle is completely absent, even when D = 4 nm. The absence of the
solvent separated minimum in the D = 4 nm droplet, which is entirely due
to the presence of boundaries, is intriguing because the properties of water
are bulk-like in all crucial respects. The solvent separated minimum in the
bulk corresponds to conﬁgurations where the methanes are separated by a
single water molecule that is hydrogen bonded to other waters. In the im-
mediate vicinity of the conﬁning surface, where water-water hydrogen bonds
are disrupted, such conﬁgurations are strongly unfavorable. The preference
for being pinned at the surface is consistent with a view that a methane is
likely to be localized in regions with maximum unsatisﬁed hydrogen bonds.
In conﬁned water droplets this situation is readily realized at the boundary.
A striking feature of Fig. 4 is that the calculated PMFs are independent
of the size of the droplet. This is because the methanes approach each other
along the surface which is energetically similar in all the droplets (Fig. 2b).
Charged solutes: The interaction between charged solutes Mq+ and Mq−
is interesting because of the competing preferences for surface (due to ex-
cluded volume) and the interior (due to solvation of charges). Such a sit-
uation naturally arises in proteins in which we expect that the charged
backbone and polar and charged residues prefer to be solvated in bulk water
while hydrophobic residues prefer the surface. It is likely that in conﬁned
systems the relative tendency towards surface localization and solvation in
the interior of the droplet would depend on the magnitude of q+. The pres-
ence of charges on the solutes will reduce the tendency for surface solvation
by making the interior of the droplet enthalpically more favorable. The
magnitude of q+ will determine the extent to which ions will be solvated.
In Fig. 5 we plot the free energy of Mq+ and Mq− with q+ = |q−| = 0.4e
as a function of their radial position in droplets of diﬀerent sizes. The free
energy proﬁles show a reduced preference for the surface for ions of either
sign compared to methane.

There is a dramatic dependence of the free energy proﬁles of charged ions
on D. This ﬁnding diﬀers from the behavior of methane which is always
found at the surface (Fig. 5). For D ≤ 3 nm the ions are more likely to
be localized near the surface when q+ = |q−| = 0.4e (see Figs. 5a-c). For

8

the largest droplet (Fig. 5d), the interior which is almost completely bulk-
like, is more favorable for both positive and negative ions. The penetration
of the ions into the droplet interior increases with decreasing curvature of
for the
the droplet surface, in accord with the ﬁndings of Stuart et al.
chloride ion.38 Just as in bulk water39 there is an asymmetry between the
behavior of cations and anions. As D increases, the enthalpy gain due to
the solvation of the ions is greater than the entropy loss due to ordering of
water molecules around this solute. The enthalpy-entropy interplay depends
on q+. In addition, the magnitude of the eﬀect depends on whether the ion
is positively or negatively charged. For example, for q+ = 0.4e in D = 4
(Fig. 5d), Mq− is only marginally more stable in the interior of the droplet
compared to the surface. On the other hand, Mq+ is strongly solvated in
the interior. Anions have a stronger tendency for surface solvation than
cations with the same charge magnitude. Localization of negative ions at
the surface enables interaction of water molecules with unsatisﬁed hydrogen
bonds.

Solute charge density determines the extent of interior solvation: On
general theoretical grounds it can be argued that charge density ( q+
vs where
vs is the volume of the solute) determines hydration of ions. In the case of
conﬁned water charge density should determine the preference of the ions
for the surface compared to the interior.
In order to probe the eﬀect of
charge density on ionic interactions we also examined Mq+/− and M*q+/−
with q+ = e (Fig. 6) in a D = 3 nm droplet. The latter have twice the
volume and therefore half the charge density of the former. Both Mq+ and
Mq− have a strong (enthalpic) preference for the interior over the surface
of the droplet, with the free energy diﬀerence being of the order of 10 − 15
kBT . Molecular dynamics simulations with a non-polarizable force ﬁeld40
have obtained similar values for the the free energies of sodium and chloride
ions in water near hydrophobic or purely repulsive surfaces and also at a
water liquid-vapor interface. For M*q+ and M*q−, the surface is much less
unfavorable compared to Mq+ and Mq− respectively. The proﬁle for M*q−
shows that the anion preferentially resides 0.2 nm below the droplet surface,
but the barrier to penetrate the droplet interior is only on the order of kBT .
Clearly, the solute charge density is important, not just the magnitude of
the charge. Whether a solute molecule is solvated at the surface or in the
interior depends on the balance between solute-solvent and solvent-solvent
interaction energies.41 Decreasing the charge density increases the tendency
for surface solvation.

The asymmetry in the solvation of cations and anions in water droplets,

9

along with the charge density dependence can also explain the diﬀerences in
the solvation of sodium and halide ions in water clusters and slabs.41 Sodium
and ﬂuoride ions were found to be solvated in the interior while the larger
halides had a propensity for surface solvation in the order Cl− < Br− <
I−. The tendency for surface solvation in these ions apparently correlates
with their polarizabilities,41 but also their charge densities and the sign
of the charge. The current results readily explain this trend even without
considering polarizability. From our results it is clear that decreasing charge
density increases the tendency for surface solvation. For a given charge
density, anions have a greater preference for the surface than cations.

Thus, the presence of electric charge on a solute molecule drives it away
from the surface region where solvent hydrogen bonds are broken. Posi-
tive ions have a much reduced preference for surface solvation compared to
negative ions. This is also reﬂected in the PMFs between Mq+ and Mq−
charge magnitude 0.4e which are plotted in Fig. 7a. As the size of the wa-
ter droplet increases, the interior becomes increasingly bulk-like and for the
largest droplet, the proﬁle is very similar to that for two methanes in bulk
water, with a solvent separated minimum at a separation of ∼ 0.7 nm. In the
2 and 3 nm droplets, the secondary minimum is destabilized by ∼ 2 kJ/mol
relative to the 4 nm droplet, reﬂecting the greater role of conﬁnement.

Fig. 7b shows the PMFs between Mq+ and Mq− of charge magnitude e.
In the 3 and 4 nm droplets, the proﬁles are virtually identical. This is not
surprising since these ions are strongly driven away from the surface even in
droplets of 3 nm diameter. The secondary minimum is slightly less favorable
(by ∼ 0.5 kBT ) in the 2 nm droplet reﬂecting the eﬀect of conﬁnement.

Fig. 8 compares the PMFs between Mq+ and Mq− and M*q+ and M*q−
(q+ = e), in the 3 nm droplet. As M*q+ and M*q− are driven closer to the
surface, as a result of the the reduced charge density, the secondary, solvent
separated minimum in the PMF becomes shallower.

4 Conclusions

Our results show that methane molecules conﬁned in spherical water droplets
have a strong preference for the surface, thereby maximizing the solvent en-
tropy. This eﬀect is due to the extensive disruption of water hydrogen bonds
caused by the conﬁning walls. The PMF between two methane molecules
conﬁned in these droplets reﬂects the disruption in solvent structure caused
by the conﬁnement. These proﬁles show only a single minimum at con-
tact; the secondary, solvent separated minimum seen in bulk water is com-

10

pletely absent. Conﬁnement by non-polar walls increases the tendency of
hydrophobic solutes to associate. Similar behavior will occur in the pres-
ence of non-polar surfaces immersed in bulk water. Since surfaces (conﬁning
or otherwise) are almost always present in practical situations, we expect
the PMF of Fig. 4 to reﬂect methane-methane interactions in such cases.
The addition of charges to the methanes reduces their preference for surface
solvation. Correspondingly, the PMF between Mq+ and Mq− becomes pro-
gressively less inﬂuenced by the bounding surfaces as the droplet size and
the magnitude of charge increase. The balance between interior solvation
and preference for the surface is determined by the charge density of the
solute. As the solute charge density decreases the boundary of the droplet
becomes less unfavorable. Our results show that the enhanced preference of
the heavier halides for interfacial water can be fully rationalized in terms of
decreased charge density.

The primary motivation for computing the PMF between Mq+ Mq−
molecules is to understand the eﬀect of conﬁnement when both charged
(or polar) and hydrophobic interactions are simultaneously present. Such
is the case in proteins which are made up of hydrophobic (≈ 55%) residues
and polar and charged residues (≈ 45%). The results for Mq+ Mq− suggests
conﬁnement eﬀects on the stability of the folded state depend on the subtle
interplay between hydrophobic and charged interactions. Let ǫH and ǫP de-
note the energies of conﬁnement-induced hydrophobic and polar interactions
respectively. We predict that when ǫP /ǫH > 1 then, under folding condi-
tions, the native state should be entropically stabilized.11 In the opposite
limit, ǫH/ǫP > 1, we expect destabilization of the folded state with respect
to the bulk. When hydrophobic interactions dominate then it is likely that
the polypeptide chain is pinned at the surface which invariably destabilizes
the folded structure. These qualitative predictions are consistent with ex-
plicit simulations of poly-alanine models conﬁned in carbon nanotubes.42
We ﬁnd that in this case, which corresponds to ǫH/ǫP > 1, the helix is
destabilized in the carbon nanotube.

The situation is complicated when ǫH/ǫP ∼ O(1) as appears to be the
case when q+ = 0.4e. Stability of the conﬁned polypeptide chains for which
ǫH/ǫP ∼ O(1) may depend on sequence and the precise interaction energetics
between water, peptide and the walls.20,43
It should be emphasized that
conformational entropy of the polypeptide chain and the sequence will play
a key role in determining the stability of proteins under conﬁnement. The
present study suggests, in accord with the conclusions reached elsewhere,20
that the diagram of states for polypeptide chains is complicated especially
when ǫH/ǫP ∼ O(1).

11

It has been proposed9,10 that barriers in the folding process arise be-
cause water molecules that may be trapped between hydrophobic residues
have to be squeezed out prior to the formation of the hydrophobic core. This
conclusion is rationalized in terms of the PMF between methane molecules
in bulk water, in which there is a barrier between the contact and solvent-
separated minima. Such an explanation is likely not applicable for folding in
nanopores because of the absence of the solvent-separated minimum between
small hydrophobic species in conﬁned water. Our results imply that barri-
ers to protein folding in nanopores should be greatly reduced. If the native
state is unaﬀected then the barrier reduction must arise because of conﬁne-
ment induced changes in the denatured states. The arguments given here
show that alterations in the interactions between hydrophobic and charged
species in conﬁned water can lead to many sequence-dependent possibilities
for folding in nanopores.

Fig. 1: Density proﬁles of water in droplets of diﬀerent sizes. There is de-
pletion of water close to the surface of the sphere. D is the droplet diameter
in nm and Nm is the number of solute molecules.

Fig. 2: Probability distributions p(U ), of binding energies U of water
molecules. (a) The water molecules in the whole droplet are considered. (b)
same as (a) except the distributions are computed using water molecules that
are in the surface layer (oxygen atoms within 0.2 nm of droplet surface).
Comparison of (a) and (b) shows that water molecules at the surface are
loosely bound.

Fig. 3: (a) Free energy of a single methane molecule as a function of
its distance from the droplet center. The clear preference for the surface is
evident at all values of D. (b) Temperature dependence of the free energy
of a single methane molecule as a function of its distance from the center
of a droplet of diameter 3 nm. The zero of the free energy scale for every
droplet is at its surface, and only diﬀerences within each curve are relevant.
Fig. 4: Potentials of mean force between two methane molecules in
droplets of diﬀerent sizes. Just as in the bulk, there is a distinct primary
minimum. However, the characteristic solvent separated minimum is absent
even at D = 4 nm. The curves are shifted vertically so that the zero of the
free energy scale is at contact for the two methanes. Only diﬀerences within
each curve are relevant.

Fig. 5: Free energies proﬁles for ions of charge magnitude 0.4e in droplets
of diameter D = 1 − 4 nm. Corresponding proﬁles for methane are included
for comparison. At all values of D there is an asymmetry, as in bulk water,
between positive and negative charges. For q+ the preference for surface
localization depends dramatically on the value of D (compare (a), (b), (c)
with results in (d)). Each curve is referenced to the surface of its respective
droplet as in Fig. 3.

Fig. 6: Free energies proﬁles for ions Mq+, Mq−, M*q+ and M*q− of
charge magnitude e. The starred ions have twice the volume and therefore
half the charge density of the corresponding unstarred ion. Curves for Mq+,
Mq− and M*q+ are referenced to the origin (droplet center) while that for
M*q− is referenced to the minimum at 1.3 nm for clarity. As in Figs. 3 and
5, only diﬀerences within each curve are relevant.

Fig. 7: Potentials of mean force between Mq+ and Mq−. (a) The magni-
tude of the charge q+ = 0.4e. The symbols correspond to diﬀerent values of
D. (b) Same as (a) except q+ = e. In this case, due to the tendency of the
charges to be fully solvated the PMF has bulk characteristics even at D = 3

18

nm. Curves are shifted vertically as in Fig. 4.

Fig. 8: Potentials of mean force between M*q+ and M*q− (q+ = e) in the
D = 3 nm droplet (in black). The corresponding curve for Mq+ and Mq− is
shown in red for comparison. Curves are shifted vertically as in Figs. 4 and
7.

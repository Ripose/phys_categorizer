Abstract

Ewald summation and physically equivalent methods such as particle-mesh

Ewald, kubic-harmonic expansions, or Lekner sums are commonly used to

calculate long-range electrostatic interactions in computer simulations of po-

lar and charged substances. The calculation of pressures in such systems is

investigated. We ﬁnd that the virial and thermodynamic pressures diﬀer be-

cause of the explicit volume dependence of the eﬀective, resummed Ewald

potential. The thermodynamic pressure, obtained from the volume derivative

of the Helmholtz free energy, can be expressed easily for both ionic and rigid

molecular systems. For a system of rigid molecules, the electrostatic energy

and the forces at the atom positions are required, both of which are read-

ily available in molecular dynamics codes. We then calculate the virial and

thermodynamic pressures for the extended simple point charge (SPC/E) wa-

ter model at standard conditions. We ﬁnd that the thermodynamic pressure

exhibits considerably less system size dependence than the virial pressure.

From an analysis of the cross correlation between the virial and thermody-

namic pressure, we conclude that the thermodynamic pressure should be used

to drive volume ﬂuctuations in constant-pressure simulations.

I. INTRODUCTION

Pressure is one of the fundamental thermodynamic variables. The calculation of pressures

in ﬂuid systems using computer simulations is generally considered to be a routine task.

However, diﬃculties arise in the presence of long-range interactions. Here, we investigate

the calculation of pressures in computer simulations of charged and polar systems, where

the long-range Coulomb interactions are commonly treated with Ewald lattice summation1

or physically equivalent methods like particle-mesh Ewald,2 kubic-harmonic expansions,3
or Lekner sums.4–6 A mechanistic deﬁnition of the pressure leads to the standard virial

expression. A thermodynamic deﬁnition of the pressure is based on the volume dependence

of the Helmholtz free energy. When the Coulomb interactions are resummed by using, e.g.,

the Ewald method, the resulting eﬀective pair interactions depend explicitly on the volume.

In addition, self interactions are present that also depend on the volume. As a consequence,

the virial and thermodynamic pressures are not identical for ﬁnite Coulomb systems, even

though the two pressures are expected to converge in the thermodynamic limit.

The paper is organized as follows: in section II, we derive expressions for the virial and

thermodynamic pressures. In section III, we study the pressure in systems with long-range

Coulomb interactions. For the thermodynamic pressure, we derive a simple formula that can

be readily implemented in standard molecular dynamics or Monte Carlo codes. In sections

IV and V, we study the system size dependence of the virial and thermodynamic pressures

for the extended simple point charge (SPC/E) water model7 under standard conditions.

II. VIRIAL AND THERMODYNAMIC PRESSURES

A. Virial pressure

The pressure p can be calculated from a mechanistic prescription equating the exterior

and interior forces on the container. This leads to the virial expression for the pressure in

an atomic system,8

particles in the system.

For a system of rigid polyatomic molecules i, j with interaction sites α and β, one obtains

an analogous formula when the forces Fiαjβ between molecular sites are projected onto a

vector rij between the “centers” of the two molecules (e.g., the center of mass),

Here, Fij is the net force between two rigid molecules, summed over molecular sites α and

included explicitly in Eq. (3).

B. Thermodynamic pressure

The thermodynamic expression for the pressure is derived from the relation between the

pressure pT , the Helmholtz free energy F , and the volume V ,

pT = −

The statistical-mechanical relation between the free energy F and the partition function

QN (V, T ) for N identical classical particles in a canonical ensemble is:

QN (V, T ) = e−βF =

e−βH(rN ,pN )drN dpN ,

1

h3N N! Z Z

where h is Planck’s constant; H = K + U is the Hamiltonian; and the integration extends

over the positions rN and momenta pN of all particles.

In taking the volume derivative

Eq. (4), the kinetic energy K is independent of the volume. Transforming the positional

coordinates into dimensionless form, V −N rN , and pulling out a factor V N from the integral,

leads to the ideal gas term ρkBT for the pressure. The non-ideal contributions are contained

in the volume dependence of the potential energy U,

pT = ρkBT −

∂U
∂V +

.

Typically, U does not depend explicitly on the volume. The volume dependence of U then

arises from the volume scaling of the particle positions. In the absence of an explicit volume

dependence, we can express ∂U/∂V as

with ∂ri/∂V = ri/3V . By using Fi = −∂U/∂ri and combining Eqs. (6) and (7), we ﬁnd the

III. PRESSURE IN SYSTEMS WITH LONG-RANGE COULOMB

INTERACTIONS

A. Thermodynamic pressure in ionic systems

The identity between the virial and thermodynamic pressures, Eqs. (1) and (6), does

not hold if the potential depends explicitly on the system volume. Such an explicit volume

5

dependence arises in computer simulations of charged and polar substances, when the long-

range Coulomb interactions are resummed, e.g., by using the Ewald method.1

We ﬁrst split the total potential energy U into a short-range part U (sr) and a long-range

Coulomb part U (c),

The pressure p(sr) corresponding to U (sr) contains the ideal-gas term and the contributions

from short-range pair interactions,

U = U (sr) + U (c) .

p(sr) = ρkBT −

where the short-range forces F(sr)

iαjβ are those derived from the short-range part U (sr) of the

potential energy. Note that the virial and thermodynamic expressions for p(sr) are equivalent,

and therefore the subscripts “V” or “T” have been omitted in Eq. (9).

Next, we consider the pressure arising from the potential energy U (c) of long-range

Coulomb interactions.

In Ewald lattice summation, the charges in a periodically repli-

cated simulation box interact with an eﬀective potential. That potential is obtained from a

summation over all periodic images. In addition, a self interaction arises from interactions

with a particle’s own images. This leads to a Coulomb energy U (c) for a system of partial

charges qiα at positions riα:

The ﬁrst sum is the intermolecular contribution; the second and third sums are the in-

tramolecular contributions, with the self interactions contained in the third sum. ϕ(r) is the

eﬀective, resummed Coulomb potential, with a Fourier representation:9

where the k sum extends over the reciprocal lattice corresponding to the lattice vectors n of

periodically replicated simulation boxes. In a cubic lattice of length L = V 1/3, we have n =

L (i, j, k), and k = 2πL−1 (i, j, k), where i, j, and k are integers. It is numerically convenient

to partly transform ϕ(r) into real space, leading to its Ewald lattice sum representation,

η is a convergence parameter chosen to accelerate numerical convergence. The value of ϕ(r)

is independent of η,10

The self-interactions in U (c) are given by the interactions of a unit point charge with its

periodic images, subtracting the bare self interaction, ϕ(r) − 1/|r|, with the appropriate

limit taken for r → 0. For a given box shape, ϕ(r) scales with the box volume V as

where star superscripts denote volume-independent quantities. This follows from Eq. (11)

with volume scaling r ∼ V 1/3 and k ∼ V −1/3. The same scaling is true trivially for the direct

1/|r| interactions. For an ionic system of point charges without bond constraints, Eqs. (6)

and (14) immediately lead to an expression for the thermodynamic pressure in terms of the

Coulomb energy U (c),

Equation (15) gives the well-known relation between the pressure and energy of an ionic

system, for which the Coulomb energy is a homogeneous function of degree −1 in the

coordinates.11

independence of the intramolecular distance vector riαiβ = diαiβ. Combining Eqs. (10) and

(16), we ﬁnd for the volume derivative of the Coulomb energy:

It is advantageous to add the intra and intermolecular forces because in common Ewald-sum

Thus the presence of intramolecular constraints in rigid polyatomic molecules resulted in a

force term to be subtracted from the pressure of the purely ionic system, Eq. (15). Note

that the forces F(c)

ideal-gas and short-range contributions to the pressure are reﬂected in p(sr).

C. Tin-foil boundary conditions and reaction ﬁeld correction

The inﬁnite Ewald lattice is implicitly embedded in a conducting medium with dielectric

constant ǫrf = ∞, corresponding to “tin-foil” boundary conditions. This is the appropriate

9

choice for a conducting medium. However, for a polar substance it can be advantageous to

use a reaction-ﬁeld dielectric constant ǫrf similar to that of the bulk medium.12 The resulting

correction to the Coulomb energy U (c)(ǫrf = ∞) is13

U (rf) = U (c)(ǫrf) − U (c)(ǫrf = ∞) =

D. General considerations

We emphasize the simplicity of the pressure expressions Eqs. (25) and (32) for systems

of rigid molecules. The Coulomb energy contribution hU (c)i/3V is analogous to that of

the corresponding ionic system, Eq. (15), corrected for the presence of constraint forces. A

more or less equivalent expression for the pressure in Coulombic systems treated with Ewald

summation was derived before by Smith,14 and similarly by Boulougouris et al.15. However,

in those derivations the volume derivative was carried out explicitly for the Ewald energy.

Also, the derivations start from an approximate expression for the Ewald energy that does

not include the full real-space lattice sum and self terms. Therefore, the derivations did not

arrive at a closed expression and the simplicity of the results given here was masked.

Expressions for the pressure tensor P for Ewald summation were derived previously by
Nos´e and Klein,16 and Heyes,17 as discussed by Alejandre et al.,18 as well as by others.19–22

However, the tensor character does not lend itself easily to a compact notation for the

bulk pressure p = Tr(P) in a homogeneous system. Equations (15), (25), and (32) have

the advantage of being independent of the speciﬁc method used to evaluate the energies

and forces. All that is needed is the total Coulomb energy and forces at all sites that are

consistent with that energy. This is what molecular dynamics codes will normally produce at

no additional cost. The Coulomb interactions can then be evaluated by using conventional
Ewald sums,1,23 particle-mesh Ewald,2 kubic-harmonic expansion3, or Lekner sums.4–6 For

approximate Coulomb energy calculations such as reaction-ﬁeld24,25 or generalized reaction-

ﬁeld methods,26 Eqs. (15), (25), and (32) suggest an evaluation of the pressure that is

formally consistent with that of Ewald sums and physically equivalent methods.

IV. COMPUTER SIMULATIONS

To investigate the quantitative diﬀerences between the virial and thermodynamic pres-

sures, we study a model of water at standard conditions (298 K temperature, 997.07 kg m−3

11

mass density corresponding to a number density of ρ = 33.33 nm−3). We use the SPC/E

model of water,7 formed by a Lennard-Jones center on the oxygens,

vLJ(r) =

A
r12 −

B
r6 ,

(34)

where A = 0.342812 kJ nm12/mol and B = 0.371226 kJ nm6/mol. In addition, the SPC/E

model carries three partial charges. The hydrogen and oxygen sites carry charges qH =

0.4238e and qO = −2qH, respectively, where e is the elementary charge. The oxygen-

hydrogen bond length is 0.1 nm, the hydrogen-oxygen-hydrogen bond angle is cos−1(−1/3) ≈

109.47 deg.

We use Metropolis Monte Carlo simulations for the canonical sampling,23 where the

translational and rotational move widths are chosen to give an acceptance rate of about

40 per cent. Ewald summation is used for the electrostatic interactions, with η = 5.6/L

where L = V 1/3 is the length of the cubic box. A spherical cutoﬀ of L/2 is used for the

real space interactions (charge and Lennard-Jones). The real-space potentials are shifted

by a constant, such that they are zero at the cutoﬀ. The Fourier space sum is truncated at

k2 ≤ 38(2π/L)2, leading to 2 × 510 k vectors being considered. A reaction-ﬁeld dielectric

constant of ǫrf = 65 has been used in all simulations. Standard ﬁnite-size corrections were

applied to the Lennard-Jones contributions to pressure and potential energy.23

System sizes of N = 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, and 512 water molecules are studied. Starting

from random conﬁgurations, these systems have been equilibrated for at least 250 000 Monte

Carlo passes. (One pass corresponds to one attempted move for each of the N particles.)

In the production runs, the energy as well as the virial and thermodynamic pressures are

calculated every tenth pass.

V. RESULTS FOR SPC/E WATER

Table I contains the simulation characteristics, as well as results for the virial and ther-

modynamic pressures. The thermodynamic pressure is calculated using Eq. (32). The virial

12

pressure is calculated using Eq. (3), where the pair forces are derived from the total potential

energy U = U (sr) + U (c). Also included in Table I are results for the average potential en-

ergy per particle. (To compare with the experimental energy, one has to add a polarization

correction of 5.22 kJ/mol.7) Errors are obtained from a block analysis,23 plotting calculated

standard deviations of the mean as a function of the number of blocks used. The reported

error is then the plateau value reached in the limit of long blocks with typically more than

about 10 000 Monte Carlo passes.

The system size dependence of the virial and thermodynamic pressure is shown in Fig. 1.

From Table I and Fig. 1, we ﬁnd that pV and pT converge to the same value of about −5

MPa (1 MPa = 10 bar) for large system sizes, with a statistical error of about 2 MPa. This

convergence is expected as the thermodynamic and virial pressure should be identical in the

thermodynamic limit. However, the thermodynamic pressure exhibits a considerably weaker

system size dependence than the virial pressure. The thermodynamic pressure for as few as

64 SPC/E water molecules is in agreement with large system sizes. The virial pressure, on

the other hand, scales as roughly 1/N 2 for small to intermediate system sizes, with its value

oﬀ by about one order of magnitude for N = 64. We emphasize that for typical system sizes

of N ≥ 256, the virial and thermodynamic pressures are identical within statistical errors

for SPC/E water under standard conditions.

Figure 2 shows the radial distribution functions of water oxygens and hydrogens, which

were calculated also in the corners of the cubic simulation box with appropriate weights. We

ﬁnd that the the radial distribution functions for N ≥ 64 water molecules are practically in-

distinguishable, whereas the N = 16 and N = 32 simulations are somewhat more structured

beyond the ﬁrst peaks. These slight structural diﬀerences could explain the deviations of

the thermodynamic pressure for those small system sizes. We caution that these are results

for the speciﬁc thermodynamic state (room temperature and standard density) studied here,

and we expect more pronounced ﬁnite-size eﬀects, e.g., for low densities.

In constant pressure simulations,27,28 the box volume is rescaled according to the “in-

stantaneous pressure” obtained from individual conﬁgurations by omitting the canonical

13

average h. . .i in the pressure formulas above. It is therefore important that not only the

average but also the instantaneous pressure driving the volume ﬂuctuations be correct. As

measures of discrepancy between the virial and thermodynamic pressures pV and pT , we use

the correlation coeﬃcient r and the average absolute deviation minus the deviation of the

averages, ∆,

r =

h(pT − hpT i)(pV − hpV i)i
h(pT − hpT i)2i1/2 h(pV − hpV i)2i1/2 ,

∆ = h|pT − hpT i − pV + hpV i|i ,

(35a)

(35b)

where instantaneous pressures pT and pV are used. Results for r and ∆ are listed in Table I.

The cross-correlation coeﬃcient r indicates strong correlation, with r values between 0.90

and 0.997 for N = 16 to N = 512. However, the average absolute deviation ∆ between the

two pressures is signiﬁcant even for systems of 512 water molecules, scaling approximately

as ∆ ∼ 1/N. Therefore, in constant pressure simulations, the use of the thermodynamic

pressure appears advantageous.

In an earlier study of pressure eﬀects on the stability of hydrophobic aggregates in

water,29 we determined the thermodynamic pressure of SPC water30 as a function of density

using Eq. (32). For the temperature and density studied here (T = 298 K, ρ = 33.33 nm−3),

we found a pressure of about 37 ± 6 MPa for SPC water. From the density dependence of

the pressure, we determined a compressibility factor ρkBT χT ≈ 0.06 for SPC water, where

χT is the isothermal compressibility. That compressibility factor is in excellent agreement

with the experimental value of 0.062.

VI. CONCLUSIONS

We have derived a simple, compact expression for the Coulomb contribution to the ther-

modynamic pressure in a system treated with Ewald lattice summation. For a system of

point ions, we recover the well-known relation between the pressure and potential energy.

We then derive an expression for the pressure in a system of rigid molecules carrying point

14

charges. The pressure in such a system can be calculated from the total energy and the forces

at each site alone. This makes the implementation of that pressure formula trivial, because

both energy and forces are produced routinely in molecular dynamics codes. Moreover, these

formulas are entirely independent of the particular method used to resum the Coulomb inter-

actions. Ewald summation, particle-mesh Ewald,2 kubic-harmonic expansions,3 and Lekner
sums4–6 can be used readily. For approximate reaction-ﬁeld methods,24–26 expressions for

the pressure are suggested by analogy.

We have compared the thermodynamic pressure, obtained from the volume dependence

of the Helmholtz free energy, with the mechanistic virial pressure. We ﬁnd that for rigid

SPC/E water at standard conditions, the two pressures are approximately equal (within

errors of about 2 MPa) for systems larger than N = 256 water molecules. For smaller

systems, the virial pressure exhibits a pronounced system-size dependence, whereas the

thermodynamic pressure can be calculated accurately by using as few as 64 SPC/E water

molecules.

FIG. 1. Pressure of SPC/E water as a function of the inverse number of water molecules, 1/N .

Cross symbols and dashed lines correspond to the virial pressure pV . Plus symbols and solid lines

show the results for the thermodynamic pressure pT . The inset highlights results for larger system

sizes, N ≥ 64. Error bars indicate one standard deviation of the mean, estimated from a block

error analysis.

FIG. 2. Radial distribution functions of water atoms. Oxygen-oxygen (top panel), oxy-

gen-hydrogen (middle panel), and hydrogen-hydrogen (bottom panel) radial distribution functions

are shown for diﬀerent numbers of water molecules. Arrows indicate half the box length, r = L/2,

for diﬀerent system sizes. The radial distribution functions were calculated for distances beyond

L/2 using appropriate weights.

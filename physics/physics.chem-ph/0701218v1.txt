Indirect dissociative recombination of LiH+ molecules fueled by complex resonance
manifolds

The LiH+ molecule is prototypical of the indirect dissociative recombination (DR) process, in
which a colliding electron destroys the molecule through Rydberg capture pathways. This Letter
develops the ﬁrst quantitative test of the Siegert state multichannel quantum defect theory descrip-
tion of indirect DR for a diatomic molecular ion. The R-matrix approach is adopted to calculate
ab-initio quantum defects, functions of the internuclear distance that characterize both Rydberg
states and the zero-energy collisions of electrons with LiH+ ions. The calculated DR rate coeﬃcient
agrees accurately with recent experimental data [1]. We identify the doorways to fast indirect DR
as complex resonance manifolds, which couple closed channels having both high and low princi-
pal quantum numbers. This sheds new light on the competition between direct and indirect DR
pathways, and suggests the reason why previous theory underestimated the DR rate by an order of
magnitude.

The LiH molecule was one of the ﬁrst participants in
early universe chemistry, and it played a key role in the
cooling of primordial gases. Therefore, the relative abun-
dance of LiH and its formation process have drawn sig-
niﬁcant attention in models of the universe. Stancil et
al. [2] noticed that direct radiative association of neutral
atoms, Li + H −→ LiH + ν occurs at the very slow rate
coeﬃcient of ∼ 10−20 cm3s−1 .

On the other hand, radiative association with ionic
hydrogen Li + H+ −→ LiH+ + ν is predicted to occur
[3, 4] at the much higher rate of ∼ 10−15 cm3s−1. The
resulting LiH+ and LiH abundances are controlled by
photoionization, collisions, and by dissociative recombi-
nation (DR) with free electrons. A recent DR experi-
ment for LiH+ [1] has measured the DR rate coeﬃcient
for collisions at T =139K (12 meV) to be (6±2) x 10−7
cm3s−1. From numerous ab-initio calculations of the LiH
and LiH+ potential surfaces [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] there is no
Born-Oppenheimer neutral state that crosses the ionic
ground state potential curve, anywhere near the ionic
minimum. Thus the high measured DR rate for such an
indirect or non-crossing process is challenging to recon-
cile with existing theoretical results. The rate coeﬃcient
estimated theoretically in [2] is 2.6 × 10−8 cm3s−1. An-
other theoretical study by Florescu et al.
[10] applied
multichannel quantum defect methods, with the relevant
nonadiabatic coupling elements obtained from a gener-
alized Hellmann-Feynman theorem [11] to calculate that
the 139K DR rate coeﬃcient should equal 3.6 × 10−8
cm3s−1. Since both of these theoretical studies underes-
timate the DR rate for this simple diatomic by more than
an order of magnitude, it shows that the proper physi-
cal description of the underlying mechanism for indirect
DR processes continues to challenge our theoretical un-
derstanding.

Quantum defect theory in connection with frame trans-
formation into a basis of Siegert vibrational states [12, 13]

has shown promise in describing DR for a model diatomic
[14] and for the triatomic H+
3 molecule [15], systems for
which indirect Rydberg state pathways dominate. But to
date there has been no rigorous test of the Siegert-state-
based MQDT formulation, for an experimentally-studied
system for which the relevant quantum defect matrices
have been determined directly in an ab initio scattering-
type calculation. Accordingly, the main goal of the cur-
rent paper is to analyze dissociative collisions between a
low-energy electron and the LiH+ ion, as a fundamen-
tal prototype system that provides a stringent test of
this combination of theoretical elements: R-matrix the-
ory, MQDT, and frame-transformation theory based on
Siegert pseudostates [16, 17, 18, 19].

where the eﬀective quantum number νΛ
γ (R)
and Λ denotes the projection of the Rydberg electron an-
gular momentum l onto the axis of the diatomic molecule.
Of course l is not a good quantum number, so γ is
an eigen-index distinguishing diﬀerent Rydberg series of
LiH. Fundamentally, body-frame quantum defects are
represented by a matrix µΛ
ll′ (R) with diﬀerent partial-
waves coupled by oﬀ-diagonal elements, after which the
µΛ
γ (R) are obtained as its eigenvalues. Ab-initio poten-
tial energy surfaces by themselves provide no direct in-
formation about oﬀ-diagonal couplings, or equivalently,
about the eigenvectors Ulγ(R), and many authors tend to
neglect them [10] or estimate them using a two-channel
Landau-Zener curve-crossing formula [20] or sometimes
by ﬁtting them in a diabatic representation [21].

But the present study exploits the familiar MQDT
theorem [18] that smoothly connects quantum defects
(multiplied by π) at energies just below the ionization
threshold to R-dependent short-range scattering phase
shifts (or multichannel scattering or reaction matrices)
just above the threshold:

coulomb functions at an R-matrix boundary of r0 = 25a0.
The target was described by an augVTZ STO basis set
[23]. From the calculated 1Σ+ and 3Σ+ quantum de-
fects shown in Fig. 1, the s-wave quantum defect is only
weakly perturbed from its Li+ limit of 0.399, over a wide
range of internuclear distances. Thus coupling to nuclear
motion will be controlled by higher partial waves, namely
p- and d-waves. The 1Π and 3Π quantum defects have
been calculated to be an order of magnitude smaller, and
they have negligible impact on the ﬁnal DR results.

The internuclear distance R is a good body frame
“quantum number” when all electrons are conﬁned
within the box speciﬁed by r0 and the Born-Oppenheimer
approximation is strictly valid. The vibrational frame
transformation connects R with the laboratory-frame
quantization of this degree of freedom expressed by vi-
brational wave functions φjv(R). Siegert pseudostates
[12, 13] provide a uniﬁed description of the bound vi-
brational states and the vibrational continuum. In the
present case they solve the vibrational Schr¨odinger equa-

with the expected total of 7 bound states found in [6, 10].
However for the lower vibrational levels that ﬁt inside,
agreement in the level spacing is achieved within 2 cm−1.
Because the orthogonality relation between two diﬀer-
ent Siegert pseudostates is slightly modiﬁed [13], a sur-
face term [14] is added to the standard frame transfor-
mation integral [24] yielding

The underline in this equation denotes that µΛ is a ma-
trix with indices µΛ
ll′ (R). Moreover, the rotational in-
dices (j, j′) of this body-frame S-matrix do not give
rotational transition probabilities - they only serve as
a reminder that the vibrational functions exhibit a j-
dependence through the centrifugal term in Eq.(3). To
reiterate, the rotational frame transformation transforms
a set of body-frame quantum numbers (l, Λ, J) into a set
of laboratory-frame quantum numbers (l, j, J). The to-
tal angular momentum J is deﬁned via J = l + j. The

LiH+ ion is treated in Hund’s case (b), with spin-orbit
coupling neglected. Deﬁnite total parity η = (−1)l+j is
also enforced, whereby the short-range laboratory-frame
scattering matrix is:

We further average over a Boltzmann distribution of ini-
tial ro-vibrational states of the ion at the temperature

As is familiar in MQDT applications, the “short-
range” or “unphysical” scattering matrix S in Eq.(6) is
diagonal in the J and η quantum numbers. It represents
an amplitude for electron-ion scattering from an initial
channel deﬁned by (l′j′v′) into a ﬁnal channel deﬁned
by (ljv), but some of these channels in S are typically
closed energetically. The physically-relevant S-matrix is
of course deﬁned only in the open-channel space and is
obtained by the “elimination of closed channels” formula
[17]:

The total energy of the electron + ion system is E, and
Ei is the ionization threshold for channel i ≡ (vjl). Here
as in Refs. [14, 15] the high ionization thresholds are de-
scribed by a Siegert pseudo-continuum state with ﬁnite
widths, so Ei and β(E) are complex. This fact alone de-
stroys the unitarity of Sphys making it sub-unitary. The
lost ﬂux is associated with a trapped Rydberg electron in
a closed channel that represents a high-lying vibrational
state that is dissociative, with outgoing-wave character,
and has a complex vibrational energy and corresponding
ﬁnite lifetime. The departure from unitarity was identi-
ﬁed by [14, 15] as the dissociation probability following
electron impact in incident channel i′:

with the incident electron collision energy εi′ = E −Ej′v′ .
This cross-section depends on the initial channel i′ =
(v′j′l′); the collision preserves the conserved quantum
numbers (Jη). The experimentally observable cross-
section for dissociation following electron impact is then

DR rate: The solid curve is our calculated,
anisotropically-averaged rate for ∆Ek= 0.1 meV and ∆E⊥

The dotted curve is our truncated result obtained by neglect-
ing the oﬀ-diagonal couplings in the quantum-defect matrix
(see the ﬁg. 1). The crosses denote the experimental data
[26], with a few characteristic error bars shown.

we must convolve over an anisotropic ﬁnite spread in the
electron energy; the spread is diﬀerent for the parallel
(∆Ek =0.1 meV) and the much broader ∆E⊥ = 12 meV
perpendicular components of the relative velocity vector.
The convolution over parallel and perpendicular energy
distributions has been performed as was outlined in [15]
and elaborated in detail in [25]. Figure 3 summarizes
our results along with previous experimental and theo-
retical results. This ﬁgure also demonstrates the results
of a numerical test conducted to interpret the discrep-
ancy between our theoretical results and those of [10].
Speciﬁcally, we have performed one set of calculations
that neglect the oﬀ-diagonal l-mixing to mimic the cal-
culations performed by [10], i.e. using only the diagonal
eigenvalue form µΛ
γ (R) of quantum-defect matrix (shown
in ﬁg. 1 c,d). Introduction of this approximation lowers
the DR rate by an order of magnitude, and this arti-
ﬁcially restricted calculation agrees with the results of
[10]. Thus, the presence of R-dependent l-mixing is cru-
cial for this system. Moreover, the rate is predominantly
controlled by d-wave collisions, whereas Ref.[10] assumed
that it was dominated by p-waves.

We now identify the qualitative mechanism responsi-
ble for this high indirect DR rate. Figure 4 summarizes

the probabilities of various DR pathways at an energy
near the ﬁrst vibrational threshold. For clarity we have
neglected rotations in this qualitative analysis, because
we found very little eﬀect of the rotational frame trans-
formation on the present results at this energy resolu-
tion. In Fig.4 no thermal averaging has been applied, and
the LiH+ ion is initially in the vibrational ground state.

FIG. 4: Contributions to DR probabilities are shown as func-
tions of energy near the ﬁrst vibrational threshold: Tht thick
broken curve represents the average DR probability. The
full spectrum of Rydberg resonances converging to the ﬁrst
threshold is denoted by the thin line. Contributions from
the second and higher thresholds are shown as the thick solid
curve. The thin broken curve is the probability of a vibra-
tional excitation process v0 → v1, which is only energetically
allowed above the v = 1 threshold.

square brackets in Eq.(9). The thick broken curve de-
notes the average DR probability across the threshold.
The DR probability drops from about 5% of the inci-
dent ﬂux below the threshold down to only 0.6% above
the threshold. The DR probability below the threshold
is built up as the cumulative eﬀect of the dense forest
of Rydberg resonances attached to the ﬁrst vibrationally
excited state, seen as the thin full curve. The thick full
curve shows the contributions to DR probability when
the incident electron is captured into Rydberg states as-
sociated with higher vibrational thresholds. Fig.4 also
explains the reason why the DR ﬂux drops sharply above
the v = 1 threshold. The thin broken curve shows our
calculated probability of vibrational excitation 0 → 1.
As can be noticed from the amplitudes for the probabil-
ities of both processes below and above the threshold,
most of the DR ﬂux just below the threshold turns dis-
continuously into vibrational excitation ﬂux once that
channel becomes open. These results indicate that the
DR process is controlled by a doorway, namely capture
of the incident electron into a Rydberg state attached to
the ﬁrst vibrational threshold. However, if there is no
higher-v/lower-n perturbing level overlapping the total
energy of the collision complex, the electron will tend to
autoionize before DR can take place. Throughout the en-
ergy range of a multichannel complex resonance, though,

the initial capture can eﬃciently pump more energy into
vibration at the ﬁrst electron recollision, and Fig.4 shows
that this resonant perturbed Rydberg complex increases
the DR rate by about another factor of 3. This complex
resonance mechanism for indirect DR is believed to ap-
ply to many other systems that are not controlled by the
usual simple capture mechanism into a dissociative state.
A hint of its importance in H+
3 DR is evident across the
energy range 110-160 cm−1 in Fig.10 of Ref.[27].

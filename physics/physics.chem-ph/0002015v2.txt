Abstract

Density functional theory has been used to study the adsorption of molecular
H2 on a graphene layer. Diﬀerent adsorption sites on top of atoms, bonds
and the center of carbon hexagons have been considered and compared. We
conclude that the most stable conﬁguration of H2 is physisorbed above the
center of an hexagon. Barriers for classical diﬀusion are, however, very small.

I. INTRODUCTION

The adsorption of hydrogen by diﬀerent forms of carbon has been studied by diﬀerent
1–7 Dillon et al 1 were the ﬁrst to study the storage of molecular hydrogen by
groups.
assemblies of single wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) and porous activated carbon. They
pointed out that the attractive potential of the walls of the pores makes it possible a high
density storage. From temperature-programmed desorption experiments Dillon et al 1 con-
cluded that those forms of carbon are promising candidates for hydrogen storage, although
the density of hydrogen is still low in order to meet the requirements of the DOE Agency
for novel hydrogen storage systems. More recently Levesque et al 2, Ye et al 6, and Liu et al
7 also studied the adsorption of molecular hydrogen on SWCNT at diﬀerent temperatures
and pressures. Chambers et al 3 have reported obtaining an extraordinary storage capacity
by some graphite nanoﬁbers but Wang and Johnson 4 have tried unsuccessfully to conﬁrm
the high storage capacity by graphite nanoﬁbers (slit pores) and SWCNT. Hynek et al 5
investigated ten carbon sorbents but only one of them could augment the capacity of com-
pressed hydrogen gas storage vessels. The improvement was marginal at 190 K and 300 K
but nonexistent at 80 K. The storage capacity of carbon nanotubes and graphitic ﬁbers has
been enhanced by doping with lithium and other alkali elements8. The alkali atoms seem
to have a catalytic eﬀect in dissociating the H2 molecule and promoting atomic adsorption.
An advantage is that the doped systems can operate at moderate temperatures and ambient
pressure.

Some of the authors cited above 2,4,9 have also performed computer simulations of the ad-
sorption of molecular hydrogen inside, outside and in the interstices of an array of SWCNT
and in idealized carbon slit pores using model pair potentials to describe the interactions.
Wang and Johnson 4 adopted the semiempirical pair potential of Silvera and Goldman 10
for the H2 − H2 interaction and the H2 − C interaction was modelled by a potential derived
by Crowell and Brown 11 by averaging an empirical Lennard-Jones H2 − C potential over
a graphite plane. In the simulations Wang and Johnson used a hybrid path integral-Monte
Carlo method. Johnson 9 also studied the inﬂuence of electrical charging of the tubes. Stan
and Cole 12 performed calculations based on a sum of isotropic Lennard-Jones interactions
between the molecule and the C atoms of the tube. They calculated the adsorption poten-
tial of a hydrogen molecule, considered as a spherically symmetric entity, as a function of
distance from the axis of a SWCNT, along radial lines upon the center of an hexagon of
carbon atoms and upon a carbon atom respectively. Those simulations give useful insight to
interpret the results of the experiments. However the description of the interaction between
H2 and the graphitic surfaces of the SWCNT or the slit pores in those works is too simple.
Simplicity is a necessary requirement for massive simulations involving several hundred (or
several thousand) H2 molecules and an assembly of SWCNT of realistic size, but one can
expect more realistic results if the interaction potential is derived from an ab initio calcu-
lation. The adsorption of ”atomic” hydrogen on a planar graphene sheet, that is a planar
layer exfoliated from graphite, has been studied previously 13,14. Bercu and Grecu 13 used a
semiempirical molecular orbital LCAO treatment at the INDO (intermediate neglect of dif-
ferential overlap) unrestricted Hartree-Fock level and Jeloaica and Sidis 14 used the Density
Functional formalism (DFT)15. In both works the description of the graphene layers was
simpliﬁed by modelling this layer by a ﬁnite cluster C24-H12, where the hydrogen atoms sat-
urate the dangling bonds on the periphery of the planar cluster. But, as mentioned above,
hydrogen is adsorbed in molecular form by graphitic surfaces (SWCNT and slit pores), so
in this work we study the interaction of an H2 molecule with a planar graphene layer. Since
the graphene layers interact weakly in bulk graphite, the interaction of H2 with a graphitic
surface is a localized phenomenon restricted to the outermost plane. For this reason our cal-
culations have relevance for understanding the adsorption of H2 on the walls of slit pores in
graphite, and also for the case of adsorption by SWCNT, since these diﬀer from a graphene
layer only in the curvature of the layer.

II. THEORETICAL METHOD AND TESTS

To calculate the interaction between H2 and a planar graphene layer we use the ab
initio fhi96md code, developed by Scheﬄer et al 16. This code uses the DFT 15 to compute
the electronic density and the total energy of the system, and we have chosen the local
density approximation (LDA) for exchange and correlation.17 Only the two electrons of the
H2 molecule and the four external electrons (2s2 2p2) of each carbon atom are explicitly
included in the calculations, while the 1s2 core of carbon is replaced by a pseudopotential.
For this purpose we use the nonlocal norm-conserving pseudopotentials of Hamann et al
18,19. Nonlocality in the pseudopotential is restricted to ℓ = 2, and we take as local part of
the pseudopotential the s component. The code employs a supercell geometry and a basis
of plane waves to expand the electronic wave functions.20

2

First we have tested the method for pure graphite. By minimization of the total energy
with respect to the interatomic distances we obtained an in-plane C − C bond length equal
to 2.66 a.u. and a distance between planar graphitic layers of 6.275 a.u. The corresponding
experimental values 21 are 2.68 a.u. and 6.34 a.u. respectively. The small (1%) underes-
timation of bond lengths is characteristic of the LDA. Next we have studied an isolated
graphene layer. Since the computer code uses a periodic supercell method, the cell axis has
to be large in the z-direction to avoid the interaction between graphene sheets in diﬀerent
cells. Table I gives the calculated energy of the graphene layer as a function of the length c
of the unit cell in the z direction, or in other words, as a function of the distance between
parallel graphene layers. Results given for c = 20, 25, 30 and 35 a.u. show that the energy
is well converged for those layer separations and that for c = 20 a.u. the error in the energy
per atom is only about 1 in 105. A cutoﬀ of 40 Ry was used in all the calculations. We
also tested the method by calculating the energy of the H2 molecule, that was placed at the
center of a simple cubic supercell. The total energy obtained for a plane wave cut-oﬀ energy
of 40 Ry and supercell lattice constants of 18 a.u. and 20 a.u. is the same, -2.247 Ry as well
as the bondlength, 1.48 a.u. Notice that this bond length is small compared to the C − C
bond length. Anticipating the geometry to be used in the study of the interaction between
H2 and graphene, another set of calculations were performed for the energy of H2 by placing
the molecule in the superlattice described above in the study of the graphene layer, but this
time without graphene. Calculations for distances between the imaginary graphene planes
ranging from 20 a.u. to 35 a.u. (the plane wave cut-oﬀ was again 40 Ry) gave energies for
the H2 molecule, identical to the energies obtained for the cubic superlattice geometry.

III. INTERACTION BETWEEN H2 AND THE GRAPHENE LAYER

For the periodicity of the system we have selected a unit cell with eight carbon atoms
and one hydrogen molecule (see Fig. 1). If we place a hydrogen molecule at any point of the
cell, the distance from this molecule to other in the nearest cells is 9.224 a.u. This separation
is large compared to the bond length of H2 (1.480 a.u.), and we have veriﬁed that there is no
interaction between two hydrogen molecules separated by that distance. The interaction of
the H2 molecule with the graphene sheet has been studied by performing static calculations
for two orientations of the axis of the molecule: axis perpendicular to the graphene plane and
axis parallel to that plane. Three possibles conﬁgurations, called A, B and C below, have
been selected for the perpendicular approach of the molecule to the plane: (A) upon one
carbon atom, (B) upon the center of a carbon-carbon bond, and (C) upon the center of an
hexagon of carbon atoms. On the other hand, for the parallel approach the molecule is placed
upon the center of an hexagon of carbon atoms with the molecular axis perpendicular to two
parallel sides of the hexagon, and this is called conﬁguration D. These four conﬁgurations
are given in the bottom panel of Fig. 1. To obtain the interaction energy curve for each of
those four cases, the distance between the hydrogen molecule and the graphene layer was
varied while maintaining the relative conﬁguration. In these calculations the bond length of
the H2 was held ﬁxed at 1.48 a.u., the bondlength of the free molecule. This is expected to
be valid in the relevant region of the interaction. This constraint will, however, be relaxed
in simulations described at the end of this section. Calculations were ﬁrst performed in
the parallel conﬁguration (D) for a superlattice such that the distance between graphene

3

layers is 30 a.u. The plane wave cut-oﬀ was 40 Ry. The interaction energy curve is plotted
in Figure 2 and the curve has a minimum at 5.07 a.u. For separations larger than this
value the energy rises fast and reaches its asymptotic value for 10 - 11 a.u. The energy at
the maximum possible separation between the center of mass of the H2 molecule and the
graphene plane for this superlattice, 15 a.u., was taken as the zero of energy. The ﬁgure also
gives the results of a similar calculation for a smaller superlattice, such that the distance
between graphene layers is 20 a.u. The corresponding energy curve, referred to the same zero
of energy as above, is practically indistinguishable from the former curve. The calculations
also show that for all practical purposes the energy curve has reached its asymptotic value
for a distance of 10 a.u., that is the longest separation allowed for the superlattice of 20 a.u.
This indicates that calculations using the smaller superlattice are enough for our purposes
of studying the H2 - graphene interaction. Then, the results of calculations corresponding to
conﬁgurations A, B, C and D for a superlattice of 20 a.u. are given in Figure 3. The potential
energy curves for the perpendicular approach (A, B, C) rapidly merge with each other for
large H2 - graphene separation, becoming indistinguishable from one another beyond 6.5
a.u. Actually, curves A and B are very close in the whole range of separations although
B is marginally more attractive. The common value of the energy of curves A, B and C
is taken as zero of energy in Figure 3. The predicted equilibrium
at separation 10 a.u.
positions and the binding energies (depth of the minimum) of the diﬀerent curves are given
in Table II. The small magnitude of the binding energies, less than 0.1 eV, shows that
the system is in the physisorption regime. Comparison of the four curves reveals that the
most favorable position for the H2 molecule is physisorbed in a position above the center
of a carbon hexagon, and that the parallel conﬁguration is slightly more favorable than the
perpendicular one. We have veriﬁed that diﬀerent orientations of the molecular axis with
respect to the underlying carbon hexagon in the parallel conﬁguration lead, in all cases, to
the same curve D plotted in Fig. 3. The diﬀerences in binding energy shown in Table II are
very small. For instance, conﬁguration D and A only diﬀer by 16 meV, and conﬁguration D
and C by 3 meV.

Figures 4a and 4b give the electron density of the pure graphene layer in two parallel
planes, 5 and 3 a.u. above the plane of the nuclei, respectively. The former one is very
close to the preferred distance of approach for the H2 molecule in conﬁguration D. First of
all one can note that the values of the electron density in that plane are very small, of the
order of 10−5 e/(a.u.)3, so the plane is in the tail region of the electron density distribution.
Nevertheless the densities clearly reveal the topography of the graphene layer. Electron
density contours on top of carbon atoms surround other contours representing the large
hexagonal holes. Densities are larger in the other plane, closer to the plane of nuclei. In
each plane the density is larger in the positions above carbon atoms and lower above the
hexagons. A plot that complements this view is given in Figure 5, that gives the electron
density in a plane perpendicular to the graphene layer through a line containing two adjacent
carbon atoms, labelled C1 and C2 in the ﬁgure. Then, points labelled M and X represent
the midpoint of a carbon-carbon bond and the center of an hexagon respectively. The most
noticeable feature is the existence of depressions of electron density in the regions above
the centers of carbon hexagons. These hollow regions are separated by regions of larger
density that delineate the skeleton of carbon-carbon bonds.
In this ﬁgure the density of
the most external contour is ρ = 1.11 × 10−2 e/(a.u.)3 and the interval between contours

4

∆ρ = 1.11 × 10−2 e/(a.u.)3

These observations correlate with the features in Fig. 3, and lead to the following
interpretation of the potential energy curves. Each curve can be seen as arising from two
main contributions, one attractive and one repulsive. The attractive contribution is rather
similar for all the conﬁgurations (notice the similarity of the potential energy curves beyond
6 a.u.) and is mainly due to exchange and correlation eﬀects. Neglecting correlation for the
purposes of simplicity, the exchange contribution to the total energy is given, in the LDA,
by the functional

ties, and assuming no density rearrangements due to the close-shell character of H2, the

where ρg and ρH2 represent the tail densities of the graphene layer and H2 molecule respec-
tively. A net ”bonding” contribution arises from the nonlinearity of the exchange energy
functional. On the other hand the sharp repulsive wall is due to the short-range repulsion
between the close electronic shell of the H2 molecule and the electron gas of the substrate.
This contribution is very sensitive to the local electron density sampled by the H2 molecule
in its approach to the graphene layer and explains the correlation between the position and
depth of the diﬀerent minima in Fig. 3 and the features of the substrate electron density in
Figs. 4 and 5. Similar arguments explain the physisorption of noble gas atoms on metallic
surfaces22 and the weak bonding interaction between noble gases.23 At very large separation
the interaction energy curves should approach the Van der Waals interaction, that is not
well described, however, by the LDA.

An interesting point concerns the comparison of the minima of the curves C and D of Fig.
3. That of curve D is deeper and occurs at a shorter H2 - graphene separation. The reason
is that the surfaces of constant electron density of the H2 molecule have the shape of slightly
prolate ellipsoids instead of simple spheres. Consequently, for a given distance d between
the center of mass of H2 and the graphene plane, the molecule with the perpendicular
orientation (C) penetrates more deeply into the electronic cloud of the substrate than in
the parallel orientation (D). In other words, the repulsive wall is reached earlier, that is for
larger d, in the perpendicular conﬁguration (C). If we consider an electronic density contour
in H2 with a value ρ = 0.018 e/(a.u.)3, then the two semiaxes have lengths of 2.07 and 1.71
a.u. respectively and the diﬀerence between these two lengths is 0.36 a.u. This value is in
qualitative agrement with the diﬀerence between the H2 - graphene separations for the two
minima of curves C and D, which is 0.20 a.u. This shape eﬀect is usually neglected in the
phenomenological approaches, that treat H2 simply as a spherical molecule.

Figure 6 gives a plot of the charge density diﬀerence

ρdif f (r) = ρtot(r) − (ρg(r) + ρH2(r)),

(3)

where ρtot(r) is the calculated density of the total system, that is the H2 molecule physisorbed
in orientation D at a distance of 5 a.u. above the graphene layer, whereas ρg + ρH2 is the

5

simple superposition of the densities of the pure graphene layer and H2 molecule placed also
in orientation D, 5 a.u. above the graphene layer. That density diﬀerence ρdif f (r)
is given in the same plane, perpendicular to the graphene layer, used in Fig. 5. ρdif f (r)
has positive and negative regions. The positive region is the area bound by the contour
labelled P. This region has the shape of two lobes joined by a narrow neck. Contour P
has a value ρdif f = 2.36 × 10−5 e/(a.u.)3 and ρdif f increases in this positive region as
we move towards inner contours in the lobes. The innermost contour shown has a value
ρdif f = 2.87 × 10−4 e/(a.u.)3. The H2 molecule sits above the neck, so the ﬁgure reveals that
the repulsive interaction produced by the close electronic shell of H2 pushes some charge
from the region immediately below the molecule (the neck region) to form the lobes of
positive ρdif f (r). This displacement of electronic charge is nevertheless quantitatively very
small. Notice that ρg takes values between 1.6 × 10−3 and 4.1 × 10−3 e/(a.u.)3 in a plane
3 a.u. above the graphene layer, while ρdif f has values of the order 10−5 − 10−4 e/(a.u.)3
in the same plane. The smallness of ρdif f justiﬁes the argument given in eq. (2) for the
attractive exchange-correlation contribution to the interaction potential.

The static calculations discussed above have been complemented with dynamical simula-
tions in which the H2 molecule was initially placed in diﬀerent orientations at distances of 4 -
6 a.u. from the graphene layer and was left to evolve under the inﬂuence of the forces on the
H atoms. The H2 bondlength was allowed to adjust in the process. The simulations conﬁrm
the results of the static calculations, in the sense that the H2 molecules end up in positions
above the center of an hexagon at the end of the simulations. The binding energies and
H2 - graphene layer distances practically coincide with those in Table II. Marginally small
diﬀerences in separation or binding energy are due to very small changes of the bondlength
of H2, always smaller than 0.3%. The result of one of the simulations is worth to be men-
tioned. A conﬁguration intermediate between those labelled C and D above was obtained:
the center of mass of the molecule was 5.10 a.u. above the center of a carbon hexagon, with
the molecular axis forming an angle of about 30◦ with the graphene plane. The binding
energy in this new conﬁguration was only 1 meV larger than in the parallel conﬁguration D.
In summary, the picture arising from the calculations is rather clear. The H2 molecules
prefer the hollow sites above the centers of carbon hexagons where the background electron
density is lower than in channels on top of the skeleton of carbon-carbon bonds. The
exchange-correlation contribution provides the weak attraction responsible for physisorption,
but the preferred distance of approach is determined by the repulsive part of the interaction
potential. That repulsive contribution is due to the close-shell electronic structure of H2. We
have performed static calculations of the barrier for the diﬀusion of a molecule, initially in
the parallel conﬁguration D at the preferred distance of 5.07 a.u. above the graphene plane,
to an equivalent conﬁguration D above an adjacent hexagon. The initial conﬁguration of
the molecule, with its axis perpendicular to two parallel carbon-carbon bonds, can be seen
in the bottom panel of Fig. 1. The molecule was then forced to follow a path across one
of those bonds, allowing for the reorientation of the molecular axis at each step in order
to minimize the energy of the system. Although the molecule begins with the axis parallel
to the graphene plane, the orientation of the axis changes as the molecule approaches the
carbon-carbon bond. In fact, when the center of mass of the molecule is precisely above that
bond, the molecular axis becomes perpendicular to the graphene plane, that is the molecule
adopts conﬁguration B, as indicated also in Fig. 1. The energy diﬀerence between this

6

saddle conﬁguration and the starting one gives a calculated diﬀusional barrier of 14 meV.
A temperature of 163 K is enough to surpass this barrier.

The conclusions from the calculations are, in our view, general enough that one can
make some extrapolations to the case of adsorption of H2 by carbon nanotubes. When
adsorption occurs on the outside wall of an isolated nanotube, the predictions of Fig. 3 will
be valid, with a minor inﬂuence of the nanotube curvature.
If the tubes form a parallel
bundle and we consider the interstitial channels between tubes, the eﬀects seen in Figure 3
will be smoothed out because of the addition of contributions of diﬀerent graphitic surfaces
non in registry. Addition of these contributions will give rise to an interstitial channel with
a potential energy nearly independent of z, if we call z the direction parallel to the tube
axis. Finally, the same smoothing eﬀect will occur in the inner channel of a tube if the
tube diameter is not large. In summary we predict very easy diﬀusion of the H2 molecule
in arrangements of parallel tubes along the direction parallel to the tube axis, both inside
the tube cavity and in the interstitial channels.

The present adsorption results can be partialy compared with those of Stan and Cole.12
They considered the H2 molecule as a spherically symmetric entity and calculated the ad-
sorption potential inside zigzag (13,0) nanotubes (radius = 9.62 a.u.) based on a sum of
isotropic Lennard-Jones interactions between the molecule and the carbon atoms of the
tube. Our calculation and that of Stan and Cole agree in that the smallest binding energy
is obtained for the H2 upon one carbon atom and the largest one for the H2 upon the center
of the hexagon of carbon atoms. However Stan and Cole do not distinguish between parallel
and perpendicular orientations because they considered an spherical molecule. Their Fig. 1
shows a binding energy about 0.079 eV for adsorption in front of the center of an hexagon
of carbon atoms and that the equilibrium distance between the molecule and the nanotube
wall is 5.7 a.u. This distance is consistent but a little larger than those reported in our
Table II. On the other hand, the value 0.079 eV for the binding energy is also consistent
with the binding energies in Table II. Notice, however, that the binding energy for a tube of
larger radius, or for a planar graphene sheet, will be a little smaller because the curvature
In fact, Wang and
of the tube increases the number of nearest neighbor carbon atoms.
Johnson 4 calculated an adsorption binding energy near 0.050 eV for molecular hydrogen in
an idealized carbon slit pore with a pore width of 17.4 a.u.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

By performing DFT calculations we conﬁrm that physisorption of H2 on graphitic layers
is possible. The diﬀerences between the binding energies corresponding to diﬀerent positions
(on top of carbon atoms, on top of carbon-carbon bonds, on top of hexagonal holes) are small,
and the diﬀusional barriers are also small, so easy diﬀusion is expected at low temperature.
The nonsphericity of the H2 molecule has some inﬂuence on the preferred orientation of the
molecular axis with respect to the graphene plane. These small eﬀects associated to diﬀerent
positions and orientations of the physisorbed molecule are expected to average out inside
carbon nanotubes or in the interstitial channels in parallel arrays of carbon nanotubes.

the unit cell, represented by large spheres. Bottom panel shows the three adsorption conﬁgurations
with the molecular axis perpendicular to the graphene plane. These have the H2 molecule above
a carbon atom (A), above the midpoint of a carbon-carbon bond (B) and above the center of an
hexagon (C). Also shown is an adsorption conﬁguration (D) with the molecular axis parallel to the
graphene plane and the molecule above the center of an hexagon.

FIG. 2. Comparison of potential energy curves for the parallel approach of H2 to the graphene
layer upon the center of an hexagon of carbon atoms. The curves were obtained using supercells
such that the graphene layers are separated by 30 a.u. (circles) or 20 a.u. (crosses).

FIG. 3. Potential energy curves for the aproach of H2 to the graphene layer in four diﬀerent
conﬁgurations. The axis of the molecule is perpendicular (A, B, C) or parallel (D) to the graphene
layer. In the former orientation the molecule is above a carbon atom (A), above the center of a
C-C bond (B), and above the center of an hexagon (C). In the parallel orientation (D) the molecule
is above the center of an hexagon.

FIG. 4. (a) Contours of constant electron density ρ of a pure graphene layer in a plane 5 a.u.
above the plane of the carbon nuclei. ρ = 8.64 × 10−5 e/(a.u.)3 in the innermost contours above
carbon atoms. ρ = 6.08× 10−5 e/(a.u.)3 in the innermost contours above the large hexagonal holes.
Densities decrease monotonously between those two contours with an interval ∆ρ = 0.18 × 10−5
e/(a.u.)3. (b) Contours in a plane 3 a.u. above the plane of carbon nuclei. ρ = 3.92×10−3 e/(a.u.)3
in the innermost contours above carbon atoms. ρ = 1.72× 10−3 e/(a.u.)3 in the innermost contours
above the large hexagonal holes. Densities decrease monotonously between those two contours with
an interval ∆ρ = 0.16 × 10−3 e/(a.u.)3

FIG. 5. Contours of constant electron density of pure graphene in a plane perpendicular to the
graphene layer, going through a line containing two adjacent carbon atoms, labelled C1 and C2.
Symbols M and X indicate the mid-point of a carbon-carbon bond and the center of an hexagon,
respectively. The outermost contour plotted is ρ = 1.11 × 10−2 e/(a.u.)3 and the interval between
contours ∆ρ = 1.11 × 10−2 e/(a.u.)3

FIG. 6. Charge density diﬀerence ρdif f = ρtot − ρg − ρH2 for H2 physisorbed 5 a.u. above the
graphene layer. The plane of the plot and the symbols C1, C2, M and X are the same as in Fig.
5. Contour labelled P has a value 2.36 × 10−5 e/(a.u.)3 and encloses the region of positive ρdif f .

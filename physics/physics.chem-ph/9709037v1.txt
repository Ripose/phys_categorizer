Abstract

We present a mathematically rigorous method for solving three-atomic bound
state and scattering problems. The method is well suited for applications
in systems where the inter-atomic interaction is of a hard-core nature.
It
has been employed to obtain the ground- and excited-state energies for the
Helium trimer and to calculate, for the ﬁrst time, the scattering phase shifts
and wave-functions for the He atom–He dimer at ultra-low energies.

The 4He triatomic system is of interest in various areas of physical chemistry and molec-
ular physics. The study of the Helium dimer and trimer properties is the ﬁrst step towards
the understanding of the Helium liquid drops, superﬂuidity in 4He ﬁlms, ﬁnite pores [1] etc.
Various theoretical and experimental works have been devoted in the past to study the
ground state properties of the 4He clusters. From the theoretical works we mention here
those using Variational and Monte Carlo type methods [2–6], the Faddeev equations [7–9],
and the hyperspherical approach [10–12]. From the experimental works we recall those of
Refs. [13–16] where the Helium dimer and trimer clusters were investigated.

Despite the eﬀorts made to solve the He-trimer problem various questions such as the
existence of Eﬁmov states and the study of scattering processes still have not been satis-
factorily addressed. In particular for scattering processes there are no works which we are
aware of apart from a zero-energy calculation of Ref. [7] and a recent study [17] concerning
recombination rates. There are various reasons for this, the main one being that the three-
body calculations involved are extremely diﬃcult to perform due to the practically hard-core

of the interatomic interaction which gives rise to strong numerical inaccuracies that make
calculations cumbersome and unstable.

In this work we employed a mathematically rigorous method based on a hard-core ver-
sion [18,19] of the boundary-condition model to calculate the binding energies and the ultra-
low energy scattering phase shifts below as well as above the breakup threshold. Such an
approach takes into account, from the beginning, the hard-core nature of the He–He inter-
atomic interaction. We show that this method is highly successful and suitable for solving
three-body bound state and scattering problems in conﬁguration space when the two-body
interactions have a hard-core.

In the present investigation we consider that the 4He3 molecule has a total angular
momentum L = 0. In this case one has to solve the following, two-dimensional, integro-
diﬀerential Faddeev equations [20]

Here, x, y stand for the standard Jacobi variables and c, for the core range. The angular

three-boson system l is even, l = 0, 2, 4, . . . . V (x) is the He-He central potential acting
outside the core domain. The partial wave function Ψl(x, y) is related to the Faddeev

We employed the Faddeev equations (1), the hard-core condition (4), and the asymptotic
expressions (5, 6), to calculate the binding energies of the Helium trimer and the ultra-low
energy phase shifts of the Helium atom scattered by the Helium diatomic molecule. In our
calculations we used ~2/m = 12.12 K ˚A2. Our ﬁnite-diﬀerence algorithm was closed in essen-
tial to that described in [20,21]. As a 4He–4He interaction we employed the HFDHE2 [22]
and HFD-B [23] potentials of Aziz and co-workers which we found that they sustain a dimer
1.6854 mK respectively. The corresponding 4He atom–4He
bound state at
atom scattering length was found to be 124.7 ˚A for the HFDHE2 and 88.6 ˚A for the HFD-B
potential.

The results of the Helium trimer ground-state energy calculations are presented in Ta-
ble I. Although the two potentials used diﬀer only slightly, they produce important diﬀer-
ences in the ground-state energy. This is in agreement with the ﬁnding of Ref. [11] but in
disagreement with the statement made in Ref. [6]. It should be further noted that most of
the contribution to the binding energy stems from the l = 0 and l = 2 partial component
the latter being more than 35 %. The contribution from the l = 4 channel was shown in [9]
to be of the order of a few per cent. We have found that the Helium trimer can form an
excited state with both the HFDHE2 and HFD-B potentials in agreement with the ﬁndings
of Refs. [7,8,12]. Note that in Refs. [8,12] this state was interpreted as an Eﬁmov one [24].
Our excited state results are given in Table II.

The phase shift results for a Helium atom scattered by a Helium dimer are plotted in
Fig. 1. We considered incident energies below as well as above the breakup threshold, i.e.,
1 + 1 + 1) processes. It is seen that, similarly to
for the (2 + 1
the bound state results, the inclusion of the l = 2 partial wave is essential to describe the
scattering correctly. The relevant partial wave functions Ψl(x, y; p), l = 0, 2, calculated at
E = 4.1 mK with the inclusion of both channels l = 0 and l = 2 are plotted in Figs. 2–5.

between κ−1 and ℓsc can be attributed to the Eﬁmov properites of the trimer system which
imply that the eﬀective range r0 of the interaction between 4He atom and 4He dimer is very
large as compared to the 4He two-atomic problem. Unfortunately, insuﬃcient accuracy of
our results for the amplitude a0(p) at p
0 which we have at the moment does not allow
us to extract the values for the r0.

It should be noted that the 4He3 system is probably one of the most challenging problems
for any three-body scattering calculation, not only because of the hard-core of the pair forces,
but also in view of its pre-Eﬁmov nature. The latter manifests itself in a very slow falling oﬀ
of the dimer wave function and then, as a consequence, in very large hyperradius values for
the asymptotical boundary conditions (5) and (6) for the trimer excitede state and scattering
wave functions were fulﬁlled. In our ﬁnite-diﬀerence calculations we had to increase the cut-
600 ˚A while we had to use grids with up to 600 knots in both
oﬀ radius ρmax up 400
hyperradius ρ and hyperangle θ variables until the converged results were obtained. All
this required for storage of the resulting matrices up to 5 Gb of a (hard-drive) memory.
Calculation of each phase shift point was also very expensive in time requiring in the case
of the two equations (l, λ = 0, 2) up to ten or more hours. We plan to describe more details
of our technics in an extended article which is under preparation.

Our results clearly demonstrate the reliability of our method in three-body bound state
and scattering calculations in system where the inter-atomic potential contains a hard-core
which makes such calculations extremely tedious and numerically unstable. Thus the present
formalism paves the way to study various three-atomic systems, and to calculate important
quantities such as cross-sections, recombination rates etc.

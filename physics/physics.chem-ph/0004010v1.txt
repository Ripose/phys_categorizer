Abstract

We investigate the presence of topological twistons in crystalline polyethylene. We describe
crystalline polyethylene with a model that couples the torsional and longitudinal degrees of free-
dom of the polymeric chain by means of a system of two real scalar ﬁelds. This model supports
topological twistons, which are described by exact and stable topological solutions that appear
when the interaction between torsional and longitudinal ﬁelds is polynomial, containing up to the
sixth power in the ﬁelds. We calculate the energy of the topological twiston, and the result is in
very good agreement with the value obtained via molecular simulation.

The existence of twistons in crystalline polyethylene (PE) was postulated [1] two decades ago,
and refers to a twist of 1800 that extends smoothly over several CH2 groups in crystalline PE, in
the plane orthogonal to the chain direction, with the corresponding CH2 unit length contraction
along the polymeric chain. These twiston conﬁgurations appear in crystalline PE as a result of
its large torsional ﬂexibility, and may contribute to elucidate some of its properties, in particular
the dielectric α relaxation [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7].

There are some interesting models of twistons in crystalline PE [8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. The works
[8, 9] are almost simultaneous to the work [13], which introduces solitons to describe conductivity
in polyacetylene via distortions of the single-double bond alternations. In the PE chain, however,
the bounds are always single bounds, which require at least one bosonic degrees of freedom
to describe the torsional ﬂexibility of this unsaturated polymer. Despite these two decades of
investigations, we believe that the issue of topological twistons playing some role in explaining
properties of the crystalline PE chain is still incomplete, requiring further investigations both
in the theoretical and experimental grounds. This is the main motivation of the present work,
where we follow an alternate route to topological twistons in PE to bring new facts to the former
theoretical investigations. This new route was introduced in Ref. [14], and here we complete the
investigation, including the calculation of the energies of the exact topological twistons.

We start our investigations by ﬁrst reviewing the basic features of the several distinct mechan-
ical models used to describe twistons in crystalline PE. The most important ones are described
in Refs. [8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. In the pioneer work [8] the author considers a system which couples the
torsional and translational degrees of freedom. In Ref. [9] the authors consider a simpler system,
describing only the torsional motion along the crystalline chain, and this is also considered in
the subsequent work [10]. It is only more recently [11, 12] that one includes interactions between
radial, torsional and longitudinal degrees of freedom. In this case one uses cilindrical coordinates
to describe a generic CH2 unit via (rn, θn, zn), which correspond to the three degrees of freedom
of the rigid molecular group. A simpliﬁcation can be introduced, and concerns freezing the rn’s,
so that the radial motion is neglected. In [11] one further ignores the translational degree of free-
dom, the zn coordinates, to get to a simple model described via the torsional variable that in the
continuum limit can be taken as θn(t) → θ(z, t). The model reproduces the double sine-Gordon
model, according to the assumptions there considered to describe the intermolecular interaction.
The other more recent work [12] on twiston in crystalline PE gives another step toward a more
realistic model. This is the ﬁrst time the radial, torsional and longitudinal degrees of freedom
are simultaneously considered to model twiston in crystalline PE. The model is very interesting,
although it is hard to ﬁnd exact solutions and investigate the corresponding issues of stability.
The problem engenders several intrinsic diﬃculties, which have inspired us to search for an alter-
nate model, in the form of two coupled ﬁelds belonging to the class of systems investigated in the
recent works [15, 16, 17, 18].

The basic assumptions introduced in the former models for twistons in crystalline PE may be
described considering cilindrical coordinates. The Lagrangian presents the usual form L = T − U,

where

T =

U = Uintra + Uinter

( ˙r2

n + r2
n

n + ˙z2
n)

m Xn

(1)

(2)

Here m is the mass associated to the molecular group CH2, and Uintra and Uinter are potentials
used to model the intramolecular and intermolecular interactions in the crystalline environment,
respectively. The intramolecular potential can be considered as

Uintra =

1

2 Xn

K1 (θn+1 − θn)2 +

1

2 Xn

K2 (zn+1 − zn)2 + · · ·

(3)

where K1 and K2 are coeﬃcients related to the harmonic approximation for torsional and longitu-
dinal motions, respectively. The intramolecular potential may contain derivative coupling between
the torsional and longitudinal motions. In this case we should add to Uintra the contribution [11]

1

2 Xn

K3 (θn+1 − θn)2 (zn+1 − zn)

(4)

However, instead of the above coupling we can consider derivative coupling between the radial
and longitudinal motions. In this other situation we add to Uintra the contribution [12]

1

2 Xn

K4 (rn − r0)2 +

1

2 Xn

K5 (rn+1 − rn) (zn+1 − zn)

(5)

The above terms (4) and (5) are two among several other possibilities of introducing derivative
coupling between the torsional, longitudinal and radial degrees of freedom. We shall not consider
such possibilities in the present work, although in [18] one shows a route for taking derivative
coupling into account. As we are going to show below, we consider the standard harmonic
approximation for Uintra in order to follow the basic steps of the ﬁrst works [8, 9, 10] on twistons
in crystalline PE.

The second potential in (2) is Uinter. It responds for the intermolecular interactions and is

usually given in the form Uinter = Pn [U0(θn) + U1(θn) Ul(zn)]. Here U0(θn) and U1(θn) are used

to model torsional mobility and Ul(zn) to describe the longitudinal motion along the chain. In
the works [8, 9, 10, 11], after freezing radial and translational motion, the above intermolecular
potential is described by the U0(θn) contributions. We can get to models for the torsional motion
alone, and in the continuum limit they may be described via the sine-Gordon potential [8, 9, 10]
A1 [1 − cos(2 θ)], or the polynomial potential [9] A2 θ2 + B1 θ4, or yet the double sine-Gordon
potential [11] A3 [1 − cos(2 θ)] + B2 [1 − cos(4 θ)]. Here Ai and Bi are real constants, used to
parametrize the corresponding interactions. Evidently, the above potentials lead to diﬀerent
models for the torsional ﬁeld, and are introduced to account for the speciﬁc motivations presented
in the respective works [8, 9, 10, 11].
In the more recent work [12], one considers coupling

3

between the radial, torsional and longitudinal degrees of freedom, but the analytical solutions
there obtained are found under assumptions that ultimately decouple the system.

The above models show that the basic idea introduced in Ref. [1] has survived along the
years, although there have been interesting quantitative contributions to investigate the presence
of twistons in crystalline PE. In particular, in Ref. [12] one includes the most relevant degrees
of freedom when one considers the CH2 group in the form of rigid molecular group along the
crystalline chain in crystalline PE. However, in the model considered in [12] we could not fully
understand the reason for not considering harmonic interactions between neighbor radial coordi-
nates, while taking into account interactions between radial and longitudinal degrees of freedom
in the intramolecular potential. For this reason, we think we can introduce another mechanical
model for the polymeric chain, where we modify some assumptions presented in the former works
[11, 12]. The diﬃculties inherent to the problem of describing topological twistons in crystalline
PE bring motivations for simplifying former assumptions, with the aim of oﬀering an alternate
model that presents exact solutions for twistons in crystalline PE. Toward this goal, let us use
cilindrical coordinates to describe the molecular groups under the assumption of rigidity. We
start with the kinetic energy (1), rewriting it in the form

T =

1
2

m r2

0Xn   ˙φ2

r0(cid:19)2
n +(cid:18) c

n!
n + ˙ρ2
˙χ2

(6)

Here we have set φn = θn − [1 − (−1)n](π/2), χn = (zn − nc)/c and ρn = (rn − r0)/r0, where
r0 is the equilibrium position of the radial coordinate and c is the longitudinal distance between
consecutive molecular groups. Now φn, χn and ρn are all dimensionless variables, and in the
continuum limit they can be seen as real ﬁelds φ(z, t), χ(z, t) and ρ(z, t). Before going to the
continuum version of the PE chain, however, let us reconsider the intramolecular potential given
by Eq. (3). We use the harmonic approximation to write

Uintra =

1

2 Xn

kt (φn+1 − φn)2 +

1

2 Xn

kl (χn+1 − χn)2 +

1

2 Xn

kr (ρn+1 − ρn)2

(7)

where kt, kl and kr are spring-like constants, related to the torsional, longitudinal and radial
degrees of freedom, respectively.

The harmonic interactions present in the intramolecular term (7) makes the dynamics to
appear as the dynamics of relativistic ﬁelds, in the same way it happens with the standard
harmonic chain. We use (6) and (7) to write the following Lagrangian density for the continuum
version of the mechanical model for crystalline PE

The above mechanical model is still incomplete, but it contains the basic assumption that we
are dealing with an harmonic chain, and deviation from the harmonic behavior is to be included
in Vinter. Although in this case we can not introduce any other derivative coupling, we still have
the freedom to specify Vinter and so introduce nonlinearity via the presence of the surrounding
environment in the crystalline material. This is the model we keep in mind to introduce the
following ﬁeld theoretic considerations.

We follow the lines of the former mechanical model, which lead us to introduce a ﬁeld theoretic
model that contains three real scalar ﬁelds. The Lagrangian density describing the ﬁelds φ =
φ(x, t), χ = χ(x, t) and ρ = ρ(x, t) was introduced in Ref. [14]. The model is deﬁned by the
potential, which is supposed to have the form

V (φ, χ, ρ) =

H 2

(9)

Here Hφ = ∂H/∂φ and so forth. H = H(φ, χ, ρ) is a smooth but otherwise arbitrary function of
the ﬁelds. This restriction is introduced along the lines of the former investigations [15, 16, 17],
and leads to interesting properties, such as the ones explored below.

We focus attention on the crystalline PE chain.

In this case it is a good approximation
[8, 9, 10, 11, 12] to descard radial motion in the PE chain. This simpliﬁcation leads to a system
of two ﬁelds, describing torsional and longitudinal motions simultaneously. However, we ﬁrst
consider the simpler system, described by the torsional ﬁeld alone. In this case, in accordance
with the Refs. [11, 12], investigations on molecular simulation allows introducing the following
torsional potential

V1(φ) =

λ2φ2(φ2 − π2)2

(10)

1
2

Fortunately, this potential is generated by the function H1(φ) = (1/2) λ φ2 (φ2/2 − π2). Also, it
has three degenerate minima, one at φ = 0 and the other two at φ2 = π2.

We use the potential V1(φ) to get the masses of the elementary excitations around φ = 0 and
φ = ±π in the form mφ(0) = |λ| π2 and mφ(±π) = 2 |λ| π2. These results identify an asymmetry
in the spectra of excitations of the torsional motion around the minima φ = 0 and φ2 = π2. This
asymmetry appears in consequence of the polynomial potential (10), and is small for small λ. It
is related to the asymmetry between the well at φ = 0, and the well at φ2 = π2. Since the mass
of the ﬁeld corresponds to the minimum energy necessary to excitate elementary mesons into the
system, we realize that the value |λ| π2, the diﬀerence 2 |λ| π2 − |λ| π2 may be seen as the energy
for the ﬁeld φ go from φ = 0 to φ = ±π, that is the energy to overcome the torsional barrier in
this simpliﬁed model.

To get to a more realistic model we couple the torsional ﬁeld to the longitudinal motion along
the chain. We model the presence of interactions by extending the former function H1(φ) to
H2(φ, χ) given by

H2(φ, χ) =

λ φ2 (

φ2 − π2) +

µφ2χ2

(13)

We are using natural units, as in Ref. [14]. The above potential presents interesting features.
For instance, V2(φ, 0) = V1(φ), which reproduces the torsional model V1(φ) when one freezes the
longitudinal motion. Also, V2(0, χ) = 0 and

V2(±π, χ) =

µ2π2χ4

(14)

We can evaluate the quantity ∂2V /∂φ∂χ to see that it contributes with vanishing values at the
minima (0, 0) and (±π, 0). This shows that the spectra of excitations of the torsional motion
around the ground states are unaﬀected by the presence of the longitudinal motion. Thus, we
can use V1(φ) to investigate the behavior of the torsional motion around the equilibrium conﬁg-
urations.

The masses of the φ ﬁeld are now given by mφ(0, 0) = |λ|π2 and mφ(±π, 0) = 2|λ|π2, around
the minima (0, 0) and (±π, 0), respectively. Accordingly, for the χ ﬁeld we see that it is massless
at (φ = 0, χ = 0), and at (±π, 0) the mass is mχ(±π, 0) = |µ|π2. These results identify an
asymmetry in the spectra of excitations of both the torsional and longitudinal motion around the
minima (0, 0) and (π2, 0). This asymmetry appears in consequence of the polynomial potential
(13), and is small for small parameters λ and µ. These results allow introducing the ratio mχ/mφ
between the masses of the φ and χ ﬁelds – see Ref. [14].

The topological solutions connect distinct, adjacent minima of the potential. The energy

corresponding to the classical conﬁgurations can be written in the general form [17]

Eij = |H( ¯φi, ¯χi, ¯ρi) − H( ¯φj, ¯χj, ¯ρj)|

(15)

where ( ¯φi, ¯χi, ¯ρi) and ( ¯φj, ¯χj, ¯ρj) stand for two vacuum states, that is, two adjacent points i and
j in the ﬁeld space (φ, χ, ρ) that minimize the potential.

Let us ﬁrst consider the case of a single ﬁeld, the φ ﬁeld that describes torsional motion along
the polymeric chain. We use former results to write the equation of motion for static conﬁguration
in the form

d2φ
dz2 = λ2φ(φ2 − π2)(3φ2 − π2)
This equation is solved by solutions of the ﬁrst-order equation

dφ
dz

= λφ(φ2 − π2)

(16)

(17)

There are topological twistons, given by [15]

(t) (z) = ± πq(1/2)[1 − tanh(λπ2z)]
φ(±)

(18)

Here we are taking z = 0 as the center of the soliton, but this is unimportant because the
continuum, inﬁnity chain presents translational invariance. The sign of λ identiﬁes kink and
antikink solutions, connecting the minima 0 and π or 0 and −π. These solutions are stable and
can be boosted to their time-dependent form by just changing z to ξ = (z − vt)/(1 − v2)1/2. This
model can be seem as an alternate model to the ones introduced in the former works [8, 9, 10, 11].
The amplitude of the torsional ﬁeld φ is π, which is the angle the chain rotates to form the
twiston. The width of the twiston, L(t), which is the length along the chain where the angular
position of CH2 groups appreciately deviates from the crystalographic positions, is inversely
proportional to the quantity |λ|π2. We can also get the energy corresponding to the static
twiston. We use Eq. (15) to get the value

E(t) =

1
4

|λ|π4

(19)

We now consider the model that describes interactions between the torsional and longitudinal

ﬁelds. The equations of motion for static ﬁelds φ = φ(z) and χ = χ(z) are given by

d2φ
dz2 = λ2φ(φ2 − π2)(3φ2 − π2) + 2λµφ(2φ2 − π2)χ2 + µ2φ(χ2 + 1)χ2
d2χ
dz2 = 2λµφ2(φ2 − π2)χ + 2µ2φ2χ3 + µ2φ2χ

(20)

(21)

Although there is no general way of solving these equations, we recognize that they follow from
the potential in Eq. (13), deﬁned via the function introduced in Eq. (11), and so they are solved
by

dφ
dz
dχ
dz

= λφ(φ2 − π2) + µφχ2

= µφ2χ

(22)

(23)

which are ﬁrst-order diﬀerential equations, easier to investigate.

To ﬁnd explicit solutions we use the trial orbit method introduced in Ref. [19]. We consider

the orbit

λ(φ2 − π2) + µχ2 = µ(φ2 − π2)

(24)

We note that this orbit is compatible with the ﬁrst-order Eqs. (22) and (23). Also, from Eq. (22)
we get

(t,l)(z) = ± πq(1/2)[1 − tanh(µπ2z)]
φ(±)

(25)

7

This result and the orbit (24) are now used to obtain,

(t,l)(z) = ± πs λ
χ(±)

µ

− 1 q(1/2)[1 + tanh(µπ2z)]

(26)

These solutions are valid for λ/µ > 1 and are similar to the solutions found in Ref. [12] to
describe the torsional and longitudinal degrees of freedom that describe topological twistons in
the crystalline PE chain.

The amplitude of the twiston is still π, while the amplitude of the longitudinal motion is given
by π [(λ/µ)−1]1/2. This result requires that λ/µ > 1, which is compatible with the investigation of
Ref. [14]. In this more soﬁsticated model the width L(t,l) of the topological twiston is proportional
to 1/(|µ|π2). It depends inversely on µ. We compare L(t) and L(t,l) to see that L(t,l) > L(t) since
λ/µ > 1 for the topological twiston of the model of two coupled ﬁelds. This result is new,
and shows that the presence of the longitudinal motions contributes to enlarge the width of the
topological twiston.

Another result follows after calculating the energy of these solutions. We use Eq. (15) to get
E(t,l) = E(t) = (1/4)|λ|π4, which equals the value of the energy of the simpler model, where one
discards the motion of the longitudinal ﬁeld. This result shows that although the more general
model changes some of the features of the simpler model, which describes only the twiston ﬁeld,
it does not change the energy of the twiston. We understand this result as follows: the ﬁrst-order
equations (22) and (23) also present the pair of solutions

(t,l)(z) = ± πq(1/2)[1 − tanh(λπ2z)]
¯φ(±)

¯χ(t,l)(z) = 0

(27)

This pair of solutions and the former one, given by Eqs. (25) and (26), are at the same topological
sector and present the very same energy, given in Eq. (??). However, when one sets χ → 0 in
the coupled model, the system changes to the simpler model, and so the energy of the pair (27)
is necessarily equal to the energy of the twiston in the single ﬁeld system. This fact explains our
results, and shows that the torsional energy is the main quantity to calculate the energy of the
topological twiston. We use this point of view to rewrite the energy as E(t,l) = (1/4) (|λ|π2) π2.
We have already identiﬁed |λ|π2 and 2|λ|π2 as the masses of the twiston ﬁeld, which show that
when the φ ﬁeld varies from 0 to ±π, that is when a twiston is formed, one changes from the
energy |λ|π2 to the energy 2|λ|π2, and this requires the value |λ|π2. We then identify this value
with the energy for twiston formation along the polymeric chain. According to Ref. [1], the energy
contribution of the localized twisted region to the criation of the twist defect is 7.3 Kcal/mol. In
fact, in Fig. [6] and Table II of Ref. [1] we see that U0 = 9.8 − 2.5 = 7.3 Kcal/mol, which is to
be regarded as the contribution of the localized twisted region to the criation of the twist defect
[20]. We then change |λ|π2 → 7.3 in the energy to obtain

E(t,l) = 17.99 Kcal/mol

(28)

This is the energy of the topological twiston, and is in good agreement with the energy values
of 18.01 Kcal/mol [1], 18-19 Kcal/mol [10], and 17.2 Kcal/mol [12], obtained using diﬀerent
numerical simulations and models.

We conclude this letter recalling that we have investigated a system of two coupled real scalar
ﬁelds to model topological twistons in crystalline PE. This model describes no radial motion, but
it couples the torsional and longitudinal degrees of freedom in a very interesting way. We have
found exact solutions, which engender several features, and here we oﬀer the following remarks.
The limit µ → λ transforms the solutions (25) and (26) into the solutions (18) of the former case,
that describes the torsional motion alone. The solutions of the model of a single ﬁeld present
width proportional to 1/|λ|, and for the two ﬁeld model it is proportional to 1/|µ|. The width of
the solutions of the two ﬁelds is exactly the same, in agreement with the topological features of
the solutions, and with the orbit (24), used to solve the coupled equations (22) and (23). This
result is intuitive, since one expects that when the torsional motion completes the 180o rotation
and returns to its crystalographic position the longitudinal motion should simultaneously return
to its crystal register. The amplitude of the torsional ﬁeld is given by the solution (25) and
is π, in agreement with the model we use for the twiston conﬁguration. The amplitude of the
longitudinal motion is given by the solution (26) and is π [(λ/µ) − 1]1/2. In the PE chain we have
to set this to unit, to make it compatible with c, the full longitudinal motion. This picture follows
in accordance with the fact that crystalline PE presents degenerate ground states, obtained from
each other by a rotation of 1800 or by a translation of c along the polymer chain.

We have also obtained the energy of the twistons. It is E = (1/4) |λ| π4. We have used |λ| π2
to identify the mass diﬀerence for the torsional ﬁeld in the minima φ = π and φ = 0. This and
results of Ref. [1] allow getting |λ| π2 = 7.3 Kcal/mol, which gives the energy of the topological
twiston as 17.99 Kcal/mol, in good agreement with values known in the literature.

The results presented in this work completes the former investigation [14]. They show that
the approach of using systems of coupled ﬁelds and the corresponding ﬁeld theoretic analysis to
describe topologically non-trivial excitations in continuum versions of polymeric chains seems to
work correctly. The procedure describes interesting aspects of the problem, and allows obtaining
the energy of the topological excitation in a direct way. We believe that similar polymeric chains
can also be investigated by similar systems, and this makes us to think on modelling topological
twistons for instance in the family of systems where one changes some CH2 groups by oxygens
periodically, to make chains with the basic units CH2−O, CH2−CH2−O, CH2−CH2−CH2 −O,
etc. Despite the presence of oxygen the bounds are still sigma bounds, and the torsional motion
seems to be similar to the PE chain. Thus, we may use a twiston model to explore properties
of the family (CH2)n − O, in particular in the case of CH2 − CH2 − O, the Poly(oxyethylene),
POE. This and other related investigations are presently under consideration.

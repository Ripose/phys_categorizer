Stabilization of Tilt Order by Chain Flexibility in
Langmuir Monolayers

F. Schmid

Institut f¨ur Physik, Universit¨at Mainz, D55099 Mainz

Abstract -

Langmuir monolayers are modeled as systems of short chains, which are

conﬁned to a planar surface at one end, but free to move within the plane. The

phase behavior is calculated in a mean ﬁeld approximation, which combines

the self consistent ﬁeld method with elements of classical density functional

theory.

It is shown that phases with tilt order are unstable in systems of

stiﬀ chains, but can be stabilized by chain conformational entropy in systems

of suﬃciently ﬂexible chains. The chain entropy is also responsible for the

appearance of an additional untilted phase, the liquid expanded phase. The

region of stability of the diﬀerent phases is discussed, and their microscopic

structure is analyzed in some detail.

Introduction.

Monolayers of amphiphilic molecules have been studied for many years for

practical and fundamental reasons. Placed on a solid substrate, they build

Langmuir-Blodgett ﬁlms, which have important technical applications, e.g.,

in thin ﬁlm technology [1]. Monolayers of lipids on water are of biological

interest, since lipid bilayers – consisting of two weakly coupled monolayers –

are essential ingredients of biological membranes [2].

The phase diagram of Langmuir monolayers (monolayers adsorbed at the air

water interface) at low surface coverage is qualitatively similar for long chain

fatty acids, alcohols and lipids (Figure 1) [3, 4]. It’s most remarkable feature

is the presence of two distinct ﬂuid-ﬂuid coexistence regions at intermediate

temperatures: the familiar “gas – liquid” transition at low surface densities,

and an additional transition from a “liquid expanded” (LE) phase to a “liquid

condensed” state at higher densities. The latter is indeed a transition between

two ﬂuid states, as evidenced by the experimental observation that positional

correlations in the condensed phase decay exponentially [5]. It is the mono-

layer equivalent of the “main” transition in bilayers, which is interesting from

a biological point of view, because it is found at temperatures often close to

the body temperature (41.5 0C in DPPC) [6]. At even higher surface coverage,

monolayers can display a rich spectrum of condensed phases, which diﬀer from

each other in positional order, tilt order, and orientational order of the back-

bones of the chains [7]. In this work, we shall discuss the condensed phases

which can coexist with the expanded phase, i.e. the high temperature untilted

phase (LS) and the low temperature tilted phase (L2, see Figure 1).

2

The nature of the transition between liquid expanded and condensed phases

has been discussed over many years. In an earlier paper [9], we have presented

self consistent ﬁeld calculations of a “minimal” model for Langmuir monolay-

ers, where the amphiphilic molecules were modeled as semiﬂexible chains with

one end grafted to a planar surface. We have shown that two ingredients are

needed to bring about coexistence between two liquid states: The chain ﬂex-

ibility, which stabilizes the expanded phase, and the chain anisotropy, which

dominates the liquid condensed state. The transition is driven by the interplay

between the entropy of chain disorder and the energy associated with collective

chain alignment. The latter may result from simple packing eﬀects, or from

additional (e.g., dipolar) anisotropic interactions between chain segments.

The model hence successfully reproduced the LE and the LS phase, yet

it seemed to fail to display stable phases with collectively tilted chains. In-

dications for tilt order were only seen in the unstable regions of two phase

coexistence. In that respect, the observed phase behavior was similar to that

of grafted rigid rod systems. Grafted rods with ﬁxed grafting points may show

tilt order in a region of surface coverage [10, 11]. However, the surface energy

per chain is higher in the tilted region than in the untilted region. When

the rods are given translational degrees of freedom, the tilting transition is

therefore replaced by phase separation [12, 13].

According to a common picture, tilt order in Langmuir monolayers results

from a mismatch between head group and tail segment size. The larger area of

the head group constrains the coverage of the condensed phase and stabilizes

surface coverage regions with tilt order. This mechanism is doubtless the

driving force for tilt order in many cases, but it is certainly not the only one.

3

For example, it hardly explains the experimental observation of tilt order in

monolayers of triple chain phospholipids [14]. Another potential cause for

tilt is related to the internal structure of the chains: When the chains are

tilted, monomers can “hook” into each other, and thus pack more eﬀectively.

Presumably, this is responsible for the presence of tilt order in Monte Carlo

simulations of endgrafted bead-spring-chains [15, 16]. Tilt order may also be

induced by attractive interactions between the chains and the bare surface

[10, 17]. For hydrophobic ((CH2)n) chains on a water surface, that seems

however less likely.

All these tilting mechanisms do not operate in the minimal model of refer-

ence [9]. Therefore one would not expect to ﬁnd tilt order there, unless the

model is extended in a suitable way. Yet we shall show that the conformational

degrees of freedom of the chains generate a new mechanism for the stabilization

of tilted states: As we have discussed above, giving the chains some ﬂexibility

brings a new phase into existence, the liquid expanded phase. On making the

chains more and more ﬂexible, the condensed phase is aﬀected too: The gain of

conformational entropy at lower surface densities compensates in part the loss

of surface energy. As a result, the region of stability of the condensed phase

is extended. Provided the chains are suﬃciently anisotropic, the coverage at

coexistence becomes low enough to support collective tilt.

The inﬂuence of conformational chain disorder on tilt in fatty acid mono-

layers has received some interest recently [18, 19]. It has been argued that in

tilted phases, an increase in the number of gauche defects in the chains reduces

the tilt angle at the same area coverage. The present work discusses an an-

tipodal, although related eﬀect: Chain disorder stabilizes homogeneous tilted

4

phases at molecular areas, where ordered, straight, chains phase separate into

two untilted phases.

The purpose of this work is two fold: To explore the possibilities for tilt order

within the minimal model, and to establish a complete phase diagram in terms

of the variables stiﬀness and chain anisotropy. The parameter region, in which

tilted phases are stable, will be determined, as well as the parameter region,

in which a liquid expanded and a liquid condensed phase can coexist. Where

those two regions overlap, one ﬁnds a phase diagram which is very similar to

the one sketched in Figure 1. The paper is organized as follows. The model

and the self consistent ﬁeld method are described in the next section. A variant

of the model [9] is used, which allows among other for a more detailed study

of chain defects. Section three presents the predictions of the self consistent

ﬁeld theory ﬁrst for ﬂexible chains, then for stiﬀ chains. The properties of the

diﬀerent phases are discussed in some detail (density proﬁles, nematic order,

chain defects), and an overview over the phase behavior is given. The results

are summarized in section four.

2 The Model.

A schematic picture of the model is shown in Figure 2. The amphiphilic

molecules are modeled as chains containing n rod-like tail segments of length

l0 and diameter A0, and one head segment, which is conﬁned to a planar surface

at z = 0. They are subject to three diﬀerent types of potentials:

• External potentials, which conﬁne the head segment at z < 0 and the tail

segments at z > 0

5

• A bending potential, which favors parallel alignment of adjacent segments.

• The interactions between segments. Tail segments are anisotropic, have

a repulsive hard core, and attract each other at larger distances. Head

segment interactions are isotropic and purely repulsive.

The external potentials hext

(head segments) and hext

(tail segments) are

taken to be simply harmonic.

where kB is the Boltzmann constant and T the temperature.

The choice of the bending potential is guided by the idea that tail segments

in the model chain correspond to two CH2 groups each in a hydrocarbon chain.

A molecule in an all trans conformation is then represented by a completely

stretched model chain with bending angles theta = 0. A conformation with

one gauche kink is represented by a model chain, which has one bending angle

θ = (π/3) or cos θ = (1/2).

In view of these considerations, the bending

potential is given the the form U(θ)/(kBT ) = u

U (θ), where u is an adjustable

stiﬀness parameter, and

b

U (θ) = 25x + 34x2 − 400x3 + 480x4

with

x = 1 − cos θ.

(2)

The function

U (θ) is plotted in Figure 2. It has a minimum at cos(θ) = 1/2,

b

and takes the value U0 = 1 there. The relative potential barrier Um/U0 ≈ 4

b

has approximately the same height as the energy barrier from trans to gauche

in popular polyethylene models (e.g. by Rigby and Roe [20]). Moreover, the

thermal average of cos(θ) in a free model chain at u = 1, hcos(θ)i ≈ 0.7, is in

rough agreement with the value obtained for polyethylene at kBT = Eg, where

Eg is the energy of a gauche defect (calculated in the RIS scheme, [21]).

6

The mapping of carbon groups on chain segments should not be taken

too literally, since the model is so simple compared to a real hydrocarbon

chain. However, the choice of a bending potential with two minima such as (2)

has the advantage, that it allows to deﬁne chain defects, and to study defect

distributions. Note that the energy of gauche defects is of order 300K, i.e.,

room temperature, in units of the Boltzmann constant kB. Hence an analysis

of their distribution can be instructive, especially in short chains. For most

other purposes, a simple harmonic potential such as has been used in Ref. [9]

is entirely suﬃcient, and yields qualitatively the same results.

The interaction between segments are introduced in terms of a functional

F [{

ρh(~r, ~w),

ρt(~r, ~w)}] of the center of mass densities of head (

ρh) and tail (

ρt)

segments with orientation ~w (| ~w| = 1) at position ~r. The functional includes

b

short range repulsive hard core potentials as well as longer range attractive

interaction tails.

In an exact treatment of the above model, one has to perform ensemble av-

erages over all possible conﬁgurations of chains, and the corresponding center

of mass densities. In this work, we will resort to a local mean ﬁeld approxima-

tion. The densities

ρh,t(~r, ~w) are replaced by their ensemble averages, and F

is taken to be a functional of average densities. Single segments interact with

others via average ﬁelds

(3)

The eﬀect of local density ﬂuctuations is neglected.

b

This approximation has a number of important implications. First, corre-

lations between diﬀerent chains are neglected. The problem therefore reduces

to calculating the partition function and the density distribution of a sin-

7

gle noninteracting chain (random walk) in the inhomogeneous external ﬁelds

hh,t(~r, ~w) = hind

h,t + hext

h,t , which have to be determined self consistently using

eqn (3) (cf.

[22, 23]). Note that correlations within a chain are still present

due to the chain connectivity. Second, the non integrable hard core interac-

tions require special treatment. We will choose a common approach in density

functional theories [24, 25], which is to expand around a reference system of

purely repulsive segments. Third, the mean ﬁeld approximation does not cap-

ture the fact that stiﬀ chains are always anisotropic, even if the constituting

segments are not. Eﬀective anisotropic interactions result, e.g., from packing

eﬀects. Within the mean ﬁeld approach, they have to be introduced explicitly

in terms of an eﬀective segment anisotropy.

Since the segments are extended objects, the center of mass density

ρ cor-

responds to a segment mass density

ρh,t(~r, ~w) =

d~r ′Kh,t(~r − ~r ′, ~w)

ρh,t(~r ′, ~w).

Z

The function K(~r, ~w) reﬂects the shape of a segment with orientation ~w. Since

b

the segments are fairly compact, the orientation dependence of the shape func-

tion K(~r, ~w) can be neglected, and it is reasonably well approximated by a

simple step function.

The ﬁrst term describes a reference system of identical segments with isotropic

hard core interactions. The free energy density f0[ρ] is derived from the hy-

pothetical equation of state of a dense melt of such “ideal” chain segments:

Being part of a chain, the segments have no translational degrees of freedom,

their equation of state has no ideal gas contribution. Furthermore, segments

are connected to others at both ends, therefore they mainly interact within a

plane perpendicular to themselves. Hence we assume that their equation of

state is reasonably well approximated by the equation of state for hard disks

[26], from which the ideal gas term has been subtracted.

The second term in eqn (7) accounts for the anisotropic and attractive

interactions between tail segments perturbatively, up to the leading order in

the densities. The attractive part of the interaction is absorbed in a single

parameter e. The anisotropic part of the interaction is described by an even

function V (x) = V (−x) and can be expanded in Legendre polynomials.

We shall neglect all contributions except for the lowest, v ≡ −v2. It should

be emphasized again that the anisotropy parameter, v, cannot necessarily be

traced back to an actual anisotropy of single free segments. It is an eﬀective

parameter, which has to be introduced in a mean ﬁeld theory in order to

include eﬀects of the chain anisotropy. Thus it has to be identiﬁed with an

eﬀective anisotropy per segment, rather than with the anisotropy of a segment.

We complete the deﬁnition of the model by specifying the parameters

kh = kt = 20/3 l−2

0 , e = 40 l3

0, A0 = 2.01 l2

0 (see [9]). This choice is motivated

as follows: The parameters kh and kt can be chosen arbitrarily, provided

they are large enough to ensure the conﬁnement of the heads at the sur-

face, and of the chains above the surface. The strength of the attractive

interaction, e, determines the density within a hydrophobic layer, and af-

fects the jump in the surface coverage at ﬁrst order transitions. As shown

in reference [9], e has not much qualitative inﬂuence on the phase behav-

ior, therefore it is not varied systematically here. In a virial expansion, e is

given by the integral over the Mayer-f-function of the attractive interaction,

e =

(exp[−vattr.(~r)/kBT ] − 1)d~r. The parameters e and the eﬀective chain

R

diameter A0 were chosen such that they are compatible with the size and po-

tentials of alkane chains, if one maps two (CH2)n groups on one model segment,

with alkane potentials taken from ref. [27].

All calculations were done with chains of tail length n = 7. Free model

parameters, which were systematically varied, are the stiﬀness parameter u

and the anisotropy parameter v, hereafter given in units of l3

0. We shall com-

ment brieﬂy on their connection with interaction parameters in other systems,

e.g., simulation models.

In a simulation, the eﬀective stiﬀness u can be es-

10

timated from matching the thermal average hcos θi for the angle θ between

adjacent bonds, in a dense melt of free chains, with the average obtained for a

random walk of rods with the bending potential u

U (2). The least accessible

parameter is the eﬀective anisotropy parameter v. As noted earlier, it’s origin

b

is mostly due to packing eﬀects. A lower bound can be calculated from the

excluded covolume (the second virial coeﬃcient) of two stretched chains of the

persistence length, divided by the number of segments. In the present model,

at u ∼ 1 − 2, one gets v ∼ 10l3

0. Such a calculation however neglects the

anisotropy in the attractive interaction. Moreover, the segment density in the

hydrophobic layer is very high (see Figure 10), such that higher order virial

coeﬃcients come heavily into play. Hence the resulting eﬀective anisotropy

will be much higher. In a simulation, v can be determined from the analysis

of orientation correlations between segments in a melt of free chains.

The procedure used to solve the problem is similar to the Scheutjens-Fleer

method for lattice models of polymers at surfaces [22]. One deﬁnes recursively

the end segment distributions (i ≤ n)

In practice, it is useful to expand functions of orientation ~w in spherical

harmonics. Moments up to l = 10 were taken into account, i.e., 121 functions,

a number which proved suﬃcient. The z-direction was discretized in steps of

l0/5. The mean ﬁeld equations were solved iteratively, using the Legendre co-

eﬃcients of the ﬁelds hind

h,t (~r, ~w) as iteration variables. The iteration procedure

combines a method proposed by Ng [28] and simple mixing: Let the vector ~xn
be the nth guess of the set of iteration variables, ~fn the ﬁelds calculated from

12

there, and ~dn = ~fn − ~xn the remaining deviation. Following Ng, we deﬁne the
matrix Uij = ( ~dn − ~dn−i) · ( ~dn − ~dn−j) and the vector Vj = ( ~dn − ~dn−j) · ~dn,

where the dimension of U and V , imax = jmax, is arbitrary (2 to 5 in this

work). We then invert U, determine the coeﬃcients Ai = U −1

i Ai( ~fn−i− ~fn). In the iteration

Unfortunately, this method does not converge for the present problem. Good

with λ ranging between 0.1 and 0.2. A relative accuracy of 10−8 was usually

reached within less than 100 iteration steps. The iteratively obtained solutions

for ﬁxed surface coverage were usually unique, unless metastable states (e.g.,

tilted states) existed. In that case, the solution with the lowest free energy

(15) was selected.

3 Results.

3.1 Stiﬀ Chains.

Figure 3 shows a free energy curve in a system of relatively stiﬀ chains (u = 2,

v = 13.7). On increasing the molecular area, the free energy exhibits two min-

ima and then rises. As the area tends to inﬁnity, not shown, it diverges nega-

tively, following the ideal gas term − log(A/λ2

B). Hence the Maxwell enveloping

function has a negative slope, which guarantees the mechanical stability of the

system: The spreading pressure Π/kBT = −∂F /∂A N −1 is always positive.

The pressure in the gas phase is however very low, in the Maxwell construc-

tion the common tangent with a coexisting gas phase is practically horizontal.

13

Figure 3 illustrates the situation where one has two distinct regions of phase

separation, ﬁrst between a condensed phase (LS) and an expanded phase (LE),

and then between an expanded phase and the gas phase (G). The fact that

there is phase separation can be inferred from the Maxwell construction, which

does not follow the free energy curve in those two regimes, and from the obser-

vation that the Gibbs free energy (17) is not a unique function of the chemical

potential (Figure 3, inset).

If one decreases the chain stiﬀness u or the chain anisotropy v, the coexisting

expanded and condensed phases merge into one at a critical point (Figure 4a

and b). This point is diﬃcult to locate from just looking at the free energy

curves, but can be identiﬁed via the inspection of the Gibbs free energy as a

function of the chemical potential. On increasing u or v, on the other hand,

the free energy minimum belonging to the condensed phase decreases relative

to the other minimum. A triple point is encountered, beyond which the liquid

expanded state is metastable, and the condensed phase coexists with the gas

phase. A state with collective tilt emerges in the unstable surface coverage

region. Tilt order thus occurs in a system of ﬁxed grafted chains, but is

replaced by phase separation when the chains are allowed to move.

So far, our results essentially conﬁrm and complete the results reported in

reference [9]. Systems of relatively stiﬀ chains qualitatively show the same be-

havior as found earlier in a somewhat diﬀerent model. Hence we shall not dis-

cuss this regime in more detail. The phase diagram in the plane of anisotropy

vs. molecular area at chain stiﬀness u = 2 is shown in Figure 5.

14

3.2 Flexible Chains.

The transition between the condensed phase and the expanded phase is gov-

erned by the interplay of chain ﬂexibility and chain anisotropy. In systems of

more ﬂexible chains, one recovers two phase coexistence if the higher confor-

mational entropy is compensated by higher eﬀective segment anisotropy.

Free energy curves for the set of parameters u = 1, v = 20.3, are shown in

ﬁgure 6. As in ﬁgure 3, there are two successive ﬁrst order transitions between

ﬂuid phases, passing from the gas phase (G) via a liquid expanded phase

(LE) to a liquid condensed phase (L2). Contrary to the case of stiﬀer chains,

however, the coexisting condensed phase is tilted. Upon further compression

of the monolayer, an additional continuous transition to an untilted state (LS)

takes place.

The tilt order can be measured in terms of the in-plane alignment of seg-

ments, dk =

hwxi2 + hwyi2. The fact that dk 6= 0 implies that the symmetry

in the xy plane is broken. Figure 7 demonstrates that the “tilted state” indeed

q

displays this kind of azimuthal order. In systems of ﬁxed grafted chains, the

tilted state is stable in a coverage interval, bounded by a continuous transition

at high coverage (marked I in ﬁgs 6-8) and by a ﬁrst order transition to the

untilted state at low coverage (marked II). When the chains are given lateral

mobility, this second transition disappears in the coexistence region of the L2

and the LE phase.

Further insight can be gained from the inspection of the nematic order in

the system. The relevant quantity here is the traceless ordering matrix [29]

S = h3wiwj − δiji/2.

It has the eigenvalues {S, −(S − η)/2, −(S + η)/2},

with the nematic order parameter S and the biaxiality η. The nematic order

15

S is always nonzero, since the chains are always aligned to some extent in

the direction perpendicular to the surface. As the molecular area increases, it

decreases monotonically in both the tilted and the untilted phase, yet it stays

higher in the tilted phase. At the ﬁrst order transition (II), S jumps from 0.37

in the tilted phase to 0.21 in the untilted phase. The value of S in the tilted

state is thus comparable to its value in the nematic phase of liquid crystals,

right at the transition to the isotropic phase (S = 0.43 in the Maier-Saup´e

model [29]). The in-plane symmetry breaking is reﬂected by the behavior of

the biaxiality, which is nonzero only in the tilted state.

From these results the nature of the tilting transitions in the system can

be inferred. The discontinuous low coverage transition (II) is associated with

ordering/disordering of single segments.

It is thus essentially a a nematic-

isotropic transition, analogous to those found in liquid crystals. The contin-

uous high coverage transition (I), on the other hand, results from in-plane

ordering/disordering of whole chains. The surface induces an orientation di-

rection, hence the transition is of XY type [30]. The two types of transitions

are illustrated in ﬁgure 9.

The structure of the monolayer shall be analyzed in some more detail.

The density proﬁles in the three phases do not diﬀer remarkably from each

other. Examples are shown in ﬁgure 10. The total segment density is constant

throughout the layer and independent of the surface area per chain or the tilt

order. It is also independent of the chain stiﬀness and chain anisotropy, and

only determined by the interaction parameter e (not shown). Compression

results in thickening of the monolayer.

The distribution of bending angles θ, shown in ﬁgure 11, is more interesting.

16

It has by construction two maxima, one at the bending angle θ = 0 and one

at cos θ = 0.5. The area under the second maximum gives the concentration

of conformational (gauche) defects in the chains. As demonstrated in the in-

set, the distribution for the outermost angle, the angle between the last two

segments, is always the same up to the molecular areas which were consid-

ered. The main graph shows the deviations from this distribution for the inner

angles. In the expanded phase, chains have more defects in the middle than

at the ends, i.e. they are more disordered there.

In the condensed phases,

in contrast, the conformational order is highest in the middle. This result is

in agreement with molecular dynamics simulations [31, 32] and other model

calculations [33].

We close this section with the discussion of the phase diagram at chain

stiﬀness u = 1 (ﬁgure 12). At low chain anisotropy v, there is only one single

untilted liquid phase, which coexists with the gas phase. A tilted phase L2

emerges at a tricritical point, v = 20.1, and separates two untilted liquid

regions, the expanded (LE) and the condensed phase (LS). The transition

between the L2 and LS state is continuous at lower values of the anisotropy v,

and replaced by phase separation at the tricritical point v = 22.7. We note that

the tilting transition in monolayers of chains with ﬁxed homogeneous grafting

density remains continuous. The tilt order parameter vanishes continuously at

a critical line, which is however hidden in the coexistence region if the chains

are mobile. Beyond the triple point, where the liquid expanded phase becomes

metastable (v = 20.5), the region of stability of the tilted phase narrows down

and ﬁnally disappears at v = 34.

3.3 Phase behavior.

We have seen that systems of stiﬀ chains exhibit ﬂuid ﬂuid coexistence of

two untilted liquid phases, whereas in systems of ﬂexible chains, the liquid

expanded phase coexists with a tilted condensed phase.

In an intermediate

range of stiﬀness, one can ﬁnd both. An example is the phase diagram for

chains of stiﬀness u = 1.5, shown in ﬁgure 13. Phase separation between an

expanded phase and an untilted condensed phase sets in at the critical point

v = 16.8. A tilted phase emerges at v = 17.1 in the coexistence region between

the expanded and the untilted phase. The liquid expanded phase ceases to be

stable at the triple point v = 17.4. The L2 phase and the LS phase are

separated by a narrow coexistence region; in systems of slightly more ﬂexible

chains, u ≤ 1.45, the transition can also be continuous in a window of v (see

ﬁgure 14).

Figure 14 summarizes the phase behavior for chain stiﬀnesses ranging be-

tween between u = 1 and u = 2. It shows a projection of the three dimensional

phase diagram in the (A, u, v) volume into the (u, v) plane. The shaded area

designates the region where a tilted L2 state is stable. The transition from

this phase to the untilted LS phase is continuous in the light shaded area,

and ﬁrst order in the dark shaded region (i.e., the two phases phase separate).

The light shaded area is thus bounded by two lines of tricritical points. The

liquid expanded phase (LE) is stable in the hatched area, which is bounded

by a tricritical or critical line, and a triple line. At very large chain stiﬀness,

u ∼ 3.5, these two lines merge and disappear (not shown). Hence we recover

the rigid rod result reported in the literature: Monolayers of rigid rods display

neither stable tilted phases nor a liquid expanded phase.

18

We shall comment on this diagram in a few points.

First, monolayers of chains with ﬁxed anisotropy v, v > 16.4, display tilted

phases only if the chains are suﬃciently ﬂexible. This substantiates our claim,

that tilt order is stabilized by chain ﬂexibility.

Second, the untilted condensed phase and the expanded phase, both ﬂuid,

are not fundamentally diﬀerent from each other. The possibility of, e.g., hex-

atic order is ignored within our approximations. Such ordering has however

been reported in the liquid condensed phase of lipid monolayers [5], and is

presumably present in our model too. If this is indeed the case, the coexis-

tence between the LE phase and the LS or a L2 phase is expected to end in a

multicritical point, and the transition to turn into a continuous transition at

lower values of u or v.

Third, the role of the temperature has to be discussed. Assuming that the

segment density in the monolayer does not change much in the interesting

temperature regime, the temperature enters mainly via the chain stiﬀness u

and the chain anisotropy v. These parameters contain the Boltzmann factor

1/kBT , and may have a complicated temperature dependence in addition. Let

us neglect the latter and take u, v ∝ 1/T for simplicity. Under this assumption,

(v · u)−1/2 is proportional to the temperature, and (v/u)1/2 is temperature

independent. The second quantity is interesting in it’s own right, since it can

be related to the chain length n: In a continuum approximation, where chains

are treated as space curves of length L, L ∝ n and stiﬀness η, eta ∝ u with

orientational dependent interactions V , V ∝ v, it can be shown that only two

of these parameters are independent, e.g., (u/n) and (vn) [34]. Hence varying

the chain length n has the same eﬀect as varying (v/u)1/2. One can speculate

19

that this remains qualitatively true for discrete chains.

The diﬀerent possibilities for temperature dependent phase behavior can

be read oﬀ from ﬁgure 15, which redraws the diagram of ﬁgure 14 in the axis

variables (v/u)1/2 and (v·u)1/2. For example, the phase diagrams at (v/u)1/2 =

3 and (v/u)1/2 = 4 resemble ﬁgs 5 and 12, respectively. In the neighborhood

of the ﬂuid-ﬂuid coexistence region, increasing the “chain length” variable

(v/u)1/2 produces almost the same eﬀect than decreasing the temperature.

This ﬁts to the experimental observation that the addition of two (CH2) groups

to a system has a comparable eﬀect to the reduction of the temperature by

10 − 200C [35, 36]. At (v/u)1/2 = 3.4, the phase behavior of ﬁgure 13 is

recovered, which is similar to the experimental phase diagram sketched in

ﬁgure 1.

Note that mean ﬁeld theories generally overestimate transition tempera-

tures. The eﬀect is particularly strong in two dimensional systems, where the

ﬂuctuations even prevent the possibility of true long range tilt order ([37]),

and second order tilting transitions are replaced by Kosterlitz Thouless type

transitions. Hence the phase diagrams cannot be expected to be quantitatively

correct, and Figure 15 gives just a qualitative picture of the phase behavior.

This picture could be tested in simulations, by systematic variations of chain

length and chain stiﬀness.

4 Conclusions.

We have discussed the interplay of chain anisotropy and conformational en-

tropy in simple model systems for Langmuir monolayers: Systems of short

20

chains, which are conﬁned to a planar surface at one end. The phase behav-

ior as a function of chain stiﬀness and eﬀective anisotropic interaction was

calculated in mean ﬁeld approximation.

We found that systems of chains with ﬁxed grafting points, i.e., ﬁxed homo-

geneous grafting density, display tilt order in a density interval. It is bounded

by a continuous transition to an untilted phase at high coverage, and by a dis-

continuous transition at low coverage. The high coverage transition involves

ordering of whole chains and is of XY type, the low coverage transition is

caused by ordering of segments and is reminiscent of the nematic/isotropic

transition in liquid crystals. Note that beyond mean ﬁeld theory, long wave-

length ﬂuctuations of the direction of tilt destroy the long range tilt order [37].

However, one can still expect quasi long range order, i.e., correlation functions

decay algebraically.

If the chains are free to move in the plane, tilt order is replaced by phase

separation in systems of stiﬀ chains. In systems of ﬂexible chains, tilted phases

remain stable to some extent. The conformational entropy of the chains sta-

bilizes tilt order. In fact, it favors phases at lower surface coverage in general,

which engenders both tilted phases and an additional untilted phase, the liquid

expanded phase.

As a function of the chain stiﬀness (or, as we have argued, the chain length),

one can distinguish between four diﬀerent regimes.

(a) Very stiﬀ chains (rigid rod limit): Only one ﬁrst order order transition is

found, from the highly diluted gas phase to the untilted liquid condensed

phase.

(b) Stiﬀ chains (or short chains): An additional untilted phase appears in a

21

temperature interval. One ﬁnds two successive ﬂuid ﬂuid transitions from

the gas phase, passing the liquid expanded phase, to the liquid condensed

phase.

tion.

(c) Chains of intermediate stiﬀness: Tilted phases can be stable. Depending

on the temperature, the liquid expanded phase coexists with either a

tilted or an untilted condensed phase.

(d) Flexible chains (or long chains): The liquid expanded phase coexists with

a tilted condensed phase. Upon compression of the monolayer, the tilted

phase turns into an untilted phase via a continuous or ﬁrst order transi-

Hence a complex phenomenology is found already in this simple model,

which incorporates only a few aspects of the hydrophobic tails in amphiphilic

molecules, and entirely disregards the structure of the head groups. The dif-

ferent phases in Langmuir monolayers at low surface coverage are largely re-

covered.

We conclude that the essential features of the phase behavior of Lang-

muir monolayers can already be produced by the alkane tails of the surfactant

molecules alone. Nevertheless, the head groups have an important inﬂuence on

the phase diagram. For example, it has been mentioned, that tilted phases can

be stabilized by a mismatch between head group and tail segment size. This

is most likely the dominant tilting mechanism in monolayers of single chain

amphiphiles, e.g., fatty acids. Future investigations will have to explore this

possibility.

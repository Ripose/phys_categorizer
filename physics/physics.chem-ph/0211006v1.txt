We analyse charge inversion in colloidal systems at zero temperature using stability concepts, and
connect this to the classical Thomson problem of arranging electrons on sphere. We show that for a
ﬁnite microion charge, the globally stable, lowest energy state of the complex formed by the colloid
and the oppositely charged microions is always overcharged. This eﬀect disappears in the continuous
limit. Additionally, a layer of at least twice as many microions as required for charge neutrality
is always locally stable. In an applied external electric ﬁeld the stability of the microion cloud is
reduced. Finally, this approach is applied to a system of two colloids at low but ﬁnite temperature.

INTRODUCTION

We study analytically and numerically charged col-
loidal particles in the presence of electrolyte solutions in
the low-temperature limit. This is equivalent to strong
electrostatic coupling at ﬁnite temperature [1]. Already
at room temperature a colloidal system thus is in the low
temperature regime, provided the electrolyte consists of
multivalent ions. In this limit, a certain number of ions
condenses onto the surface of the colloid. For consistency,
we will call the charged colloids macroions, and the ions
of the electrolyte microions. For the general macroion
problems, this behaviour has recently attracted a lot of
attention especially due to its importance in biological
systems [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8].
Macroion complexes

counter-
intuitive phenomena. The most pronounced one is
referred to as overcharging or charge inversion. A cer-
tain number of microions is needed to condense for the
entire complex (macroion and condensed microions) to
become charge neutral. Sometimes an excessive number
of microions condenses [5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15,
16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21] and the complex, the “dressed”
macroion, acquires an eﬀective charge that is opposite
in sign to that of the bare macroion. This phenomenon
[22, 23, 24]
is beyond the standard Debye-H¨uckel
and
(DLVO)
theories [25].

Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek

exhibit numerous

Another phenomenon is auto-ionisation [16, 17, 19].
This means that one macroion transfers some of its mi-
croions to another macroion, so that the ﬁrst one becomes
undercharged while at the same time the second one be-
comes overcharged. Also analysed in the literature is the
important question of transport in an external electric
ﬁeld. A bare macroion will move in the direction deter-
mined by its own charge. The binding of microions to it
can under certain conditions reverse the direction.

These results have mostly been arrived at by molecu-
lar dynamics (MD) and Monte Carlo (MC) simulations.
Simulations oﬀer the advantage that ﬁnite temperature
can be taken into account in a natural way. Purely an-
alytical approaches have to resort to relatively compli-

cated starting points since mean-ﬁeld theories are insuf-
ﬁcient [22, 23, 24]. A successful and often used approach
is the model of a two-dimensional Wigner crystal which
becomes exact at zero temperature and very large num-
ber of microions per macroion [32].

At zero temperature — without any restrictions on the
number of microions — the problem is, however, directly
related to the classical “Thomson problem” of ﬁnding
stable conﬁgurations of N mutually repelling electrons
on the surface of a sphere [26, 27]. While the original
problem was about the “Plum Pudding” model for the
atom, where N particles are conﬁned inside a homoge-
neously charged sphere, both problems actually are iden-
tical since the repelling interaction will push all particles
inside the sphere toward its surface. This similarity be-
tween overcharging and the Thomson problem seems to
have been largely unnoticed in the macroion literature.

In this paper we will make use of the Thomson prob-
lem to derive rigorous bounds for the phenomena dis-
cussed above. At zero temperature, our results are exact
and hence an improvement on previously known results
from Wigner crystal theory. Compared to the results of
simulations, our derivation suﬀers from our inability to
include ﬁnite temperature in an exact way. However, our
method outperforms previous ones in both the ease of
the method (both conceptually and numerically) and in
allowing to treat many phenomena in a single consistent
way.

This paper is organised as follows.

In Sec. II we
summarise the so-called primitive model. This model
is used in basically all studies of macroion complexes.
In Secs. III–V we analyse the stability of overcharged
macroion complexes. We use concepts from dynamical-
systems theory to show that two diﬀerent stability prop-
erties exist, global stability (Sec. III) and local stability
(Sec. IV). In Sec. VI we move on to the question of a
macroion in an applied external ﬁeld, i. e., electrophore-
sis. We will discuss the auto-ionisation of macroions in
Sec. VII. We conclude in Sec. VIII.

II. MODEL

We consider a spherical macroion of charge Q and ra-
dius Rmac, surrounded by N spherical microions of charge
q and radius Rmic. Q and q are of opposite signs, and in
the following we assume Q < 0. The macroion is ﬁxed
at the origin and the N microions are distributed at po-
sitions ~ri, i = 1, . . . , N . The total electrostatic energy V
for a particular conﬁguration is then given by

where the ﬁrst sum accounts for the mutual repulsion of

core interaction

Equations (1) and (2) comprise the so-called primitive
model [8].

III. GLOBAL STABILITY

We approach the problem by using the well-known
Earnshaw’s theorem [28] which states that there can be
no stable state in a system with only electrostatic inter-
actions present. For stable conﬁgurations to exist, short-
range repulsive forces must be present in addition to the
long-range Coulomb ones. For our system, the short-
range forces are due to hard-core interaction [Eq. (2)].
Earnshaw’s theorem thus restricts stable conﬁgurations
to have all microions at a distance R ≡ Rmac +Rmic away
from the centre of the macroion.

The condition |~ri| = R allows us to simplify Eq. (1) to

no longer describes the energy of an arbitrary arrange-

rangement instead. Next, we introduce the function

by N .

At the ground state Eq. (4) becomes minimised. The
complete solution can be computed numerically very ef-
ﬁciently [29]. Furthermore, the functional form of f (N )
is known to excellent precision [27] to be

f (N ) =

− cN 3/2 with c = 0.5510 .

This formula is easy to understand when one notices that
the ﬁrst term is the energy of a continuous layer of charge
on a sphere of unit radius while the second term is the
self-energy correction due to discrete microions which can
be shown to be proportional to N 3/2. A comparison of
Eq. (5) and a numerical solution of the exact formula
[Eq. (4)] is shown in Fig. 1.

By using the condition |~ri| = R for all i we have com-
pletely accounted for the hard-core interaction between
the macroion and the microions. We can neglect the
hard-core interaction between microions since they repel
each other as their charges have the same sign. Collecting
results, the potential energy of the lowest energy state for
a macroion surrounded by N microions is given by

Earnshaw’s theorem gives a necessary but not suﬃ-
cient criterion for the stability of a system. Furthermore,
it states that an unstable microion is immediately pushed
to inﬁnity. Let us consider a macroion and N microions
where we place the microions at arbitrary positions —
not necessarily on the macroion. Due to Earnshaw’s
theorem, M of them will attach to the macroion while
k = N − M will escape to inﬁnity. All N will go to the
macroion if it is the state lowest in energy, i. e., if

V (N ) < V (M ) ∀ 0 ≤ M < N .

(7)

where we demand that the coordinates {~r◦
i } are the ones
for the lowest energy state with N microions around the

This condition is much stronger than the simple condition
V (N ) < 0, since the latter only prevents all microions

3

microions would stay touching the macroion forever — if
prepared with this initial condition.

To calculate the condition for the existence of such
a barrier we move particle k slightly away from the
macroion by a distance ∆, keeping all other microions
on the surface of the macroion.
If this move increases
the potential energy, resulting in a restoring force, the
system is locally stable.

k = R + ∆ and r′

We label all quantities in the perturbed state by a
prime, hence r′
l = rl = R ∀ l 6= k,
and we introduce the abbreviation dkl = |~rk − ~rl|. Since
we need to consider only small ∆, we can use a series
expansion, with the result

The system is locally stable if and only if the expression

∆ will increase the potential energy. Thus, the condi-
tion for local stability is hk < 0 ∀ k. Since the lowest
energy arrangement of the particles rarely is completely
symmetric, this yields the necessary but not suﬃcient
condition hhkik < 0, where this average is over all pos-
k hk = V (N ), this gives

from escaping simultaneously while Eq. (7) also prevents
some from escaping.

Due to Earnshaw’s theorem, all stable solutions are
enumerated by the number of microions, and we simply
have to ﬁnd the number yielding the lowest energy. Since
Eq. (6) possesses only a single extremum for given pa-
rameters q, Q and R, we can simply use dV (N )/dN = 0.

where we have used the assumption Q < 0 introduced
above.

The ﬁrst term |Q|/q gives the naive result that a com-
plex consisting of macroion and layer of microions should
be charge neutral. The other two terms give the excess
bound microions. The maximum stable overcharging in
terms of charge is Qglob = qNglob − |Q|, see Fig. 2.

The stability criterion that we derived applies to an
arbitrary initial placement of microions. For this reason,
this kind of stability is referred to as global stability, see
any textbook on nonlinear dynamics, e. g. Ref. 30.

IV. LOCAL STABILITY

In addition to global stability, there exists the con-
cept of local stability. While global stability states that
the microions will move to the macroion independent of
their initial positions, local stability means that they will
stay at the macroion if they have initially been placed
there. The system is locally stable (but not globally) if
the system could lower its energy by transferring one (or
more) microions from the macroion to inﬁnity but in do-
ing so would need to cross an energy barrier. Since we
are restricting ourselves to classical physics at zero tem-
perature, it is impossible to cross such a barrier and the

In terms of charge this is Qloc = qNloc − |Q|.

To check the diﬀerence between Eq. (12) and the ex-
act solution, we have numerically computed the lowest
energy state as a function of N , and from that deter-
mined the largest hk for each N . The result in Fig. 3
shows that hardly any diﬀerence between the two values
can be seen. This does not come as a surprise since the
diﬀerences between hk for diﬀerent k are small as the re-
pelling forces among the microions try to make all mutual
distances as equal as possible.

V. SUMMARY OF STABILITY CONCEPTS

For ﬁnite q, the number of microions that are bound
globally stable is always larger than the value N = |Q|/q,
i. e., the macroion is overcharged. In the continuous limit
q → 0 this eﬀect disappears.
In contrast, the number
of locally stable bound microions is at least twice the
amount needed for charge neutrality, and this eﬀect per-
sists even in the continuous limit. Fig. 4 shows the dif-
ferent regimes as a function of the charges of macroion
and microions.

We now want to put our results into perspective of
previous results on overcharging [5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12,
13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21]. At ﬁnite T , there are
only few simulations done in the geometry employed in
this paper, e. g., Ref. 21. Most analytical work focuses on
T = 0, both due to simplicity and allowing one to focus
on the inﬂuence of correlations. We employ the same
approach.

The main advantage of our approach is the adoption
of the exact Thomson model as source for the potential
energy V (N ) whereas previous papers used an energy
estimate for V (N ) derived from strongly-correlated liquid
and Wigner crystal theory [5, 16]. The Wigner crystal
theory contains a parameter α whose value can either
be determined from simulations as a function of N —
which trivially leads to a self-consistent result — or needs
to be ﬁxed with the analytical value for α known for a
two-dimensional Wigner crystal. In the latter case, this
results in an error of up to order 10 % for the computed
energies [16]. In contrast the error of Eq. (5) is negligible
(less than 10−4).

We apply methods from nonlinear dynamics, using the
concepts of local and global stability. The existence of
these two diﬀerent stability properties seems to be unno-
ticed in macroion literature. For example, the criterion
by Messina et al. agrees with our global stability cri-
terion up to the diﬀerences caused by their choice for
V (N ). The concept of local stability, however, is also
an important one as can be seen, for example, in the
electrophoresis setup treated in the following section.

Finally, for numerical calculations we employ a min-
imisation scheme. Only a few diﬀerent initial conditions
are necessary to make sure that the algorithm does not
become stuck in a local minimum. This is in contrast to
MD simulations which suﬀer from the slowing down of
the dynamics at low temperature.

VI. MACROION IN AN EXTERNAL ELECTRIC
FIELD

Let us consider a macroion with N microions in an
external ﬁeld ~E. We will restrict ourselves to the case of
homogeneous external ﬁeld so that the dipole and higher
moments of the macroion complex are irrelevant. Typical
electrophoresis experiments are done in the presence of a
homogeneous ﬁeld.

The total force acting on the complex becomes simply

~F = (qN + Q)~E .

(13)

The complex will thus move in the same direction as the
bare macroion if the macroion is undercharged, it will
move in the opposite direction if it is overcharged, and it
will remain at rest if it is charge neutral.

Having a macroion complex with given N , q and Q,
the interesting question is not in which direction the ef-
fective force acts [since that question is trivially answered
by Eq. (13)] but rather whether the forces become so
large that the system disintegrates. (For a system with
only gravity, this problem is referred to as stability under
tidal forces.) This was noted earlier when the dependence
of the mobility of the macroion complex on an applied
ﬁeld was analysed [13, 31]. While it was shown for a
few examples that some microions are “ripped oﬀ” the
macroion, no systematic study of the stability criterion

under an applied external ﬁeld has been done (to the
author’s knowledge). Here, we aim to ﬁll this gap.

The concept of globally stability introduced in Sec. III
cannot be applied in the presence of an external ﬁeld
since the potential energy is not bounded from below [33],
and local stability of the complex is the relevant concept.
Again, we move particle k by a distance ∆ ≪ R away
from the macroion. To ﬁrst order the potential energy

The third term in the bracket of Eq. (16a) is the diﬀerence
to Eq. (10). It describes the interaction with the external
ﬁeld and depends on the angle between the position of
the particle and the external ﬁeld.

As in Sec. IV the macroion complex is locally stable
if and only if hk < 0 for all k. A closer inspection of
Eq. (16a) and comparison to Eq. (14) shows that the big
bracket no longer is directly related to the energy of the
k-th particle (as it was in Sec. IV) as the sign in front of
~E · ~r◦

k is inverted [34].

We have been unable to ﬁnd analytical expressions for
the critical external ﬁeld at which the macroion complex
becomes unstable and had to resort to a numerical solu-
tion of Eq. (16). The numerical procedure, however, is
basically identical to the one without an applied exter-
nal ﬁeld, hence numerically very inexpensive. The result
is depicted in Fig. 5. The roughness of the curves is
not a sign of a numerical problem but rather due to the
physics of the problem. Depending on the precise value
for N , the geometrical arrangement is more or less sym-
metrical, resulting in large changes in the dipole moment
when N is changed by only 1. Without an external ﬁeld,
this dipole moment is not relevant, and all quantities are
smooth functions of N . This is no longer the case now.
In Sec. IV we have shown that it is always possible to
bind at least 2|Q|/q microions in a locally stable manner.
Thus, for N ≤ 2|Q|/q a ﬁnite electric ﬁeld is necessary to
break up the complex. For larger N , however, the critical
ﬁeld may vanish, explaining the division of the diagram
into two separate regions by the line N = 2|Q|/q.

VII. CHARGE DISTRIBUTION BETWEEN
TWO MACROIONS

Next, we apply our approach to the case of two well-
separated macroions, with charges Q1 and Q2, and radii
R1 and R2, respectively, together with M ≡ |Q1 + Q2|/q
microions so as to achieve charge neutrality. According
to Fig. 3 and Eq. (12), there are many diﬀerent pos-
sibilities for distributing those M particles among the
two macroions in a locally stable way. The naive result
is the one where each dressed macroion becomes charge
neutral. However, it is possible that δ microions will
be transferred from the ﬁrst macroion to the second (if
δ < 0, |δ| ions are transferred in the opposite direction).
Such a state is called “ionised” [16, 17, 19]. Neglect-
ing interactions among the two macroions, since they are
well separated, and applying Eq. (6) gives the potential
energy V (δ)

We assume that the ions are at very low but ﬁnite tem-

state is easily computed from Eq. (17) and provides a re-
lation between Q1, Q2 and δ for the ground state. This
result is most easily displayed when Q2 is expressed in

attracts more microions than naively expected. This is in
agreement with earlier results for R1 = R2 where the cor-
relation eﬀects in a three-dimensional layer were approxi-
mated by the eﬀects in a two-dimensional Wigner crystal
and conﬁrmed by numerical simulations [16, 17, 19]. For
R1 6= R2 the macroions are uncharged only if

Other conﬁgurations than the lowest energy state can be
excited thermally, and, due to local stability, can persist
for relatively long times.

In a strict mathematical sense, at ﬁnite temperature
microions cannot be bound to a three-dimensional struc-
ture like a sphere. This is in contrast to a rod or a planar
geometry [7]. If the temperature is not too high, or equiv-
alently, if the electrostatic coupling is strong enough (i, e.,
large |Q1|, |Q2| and q as well as small R), the methods
presented in this paper can still be applied in an approx-
imate fashion. Microions stay very close to one macroion
for most of the time, before they hop (i. e., move within
a time that is short compared to the time that they re-

neglect the short hopping phases, the probability for a
given ionisation level δ is then given by the Boltzmann
factor, P (∆) ∝ exp[−βV (δ)], and is easily evaluated nu-
merically for arbitrary parameters.

VIII. CONCLUSIONS

To conclude, using general stability concepts we have
shown that for a charged macroion a stable overcharged
state persists at zero temperature. The number of glob-
ally stable microions is given by Eq. (8), the number of
locally stable microions is given by Eq. (12). Physically,
global stability means that a random arrangement of mi-
croions will move to form a layer around the macroion,
whereas local stability means that a layer that exists due
to initial conditions will persist forever. An applied ex-
ternal ﬁeld, as used in electrophoresis, decreases the sta-
bility of the microion cloud, as demonstrated in Fig. 5.
We have also applied this approach to a system of two
macroions. In its ground state each of the two macroions
acquires a nonvanishing net charge, see Eq. (18), unless
Eq. (19) is fulﬁlled.

The value of our approach lies in the fact that it is ex-
act, and by that clariﬁes the eﬀects caused by ﬁnite size,
ﬁnite charge, correlations and electrostatic interactions.

[32] At very large number of microions, the curvature of the
macroion surface seen by each microion becomes negli-
gible. Then and only then the microion layer becomes
two-dimensional.

[33] Imagine the bare macroion moving against the direction
of the ﬁeld to inﬁnity, and the microions in the direction
of the ﬁeld.

[34] This sign is easily understood by noting that the ener-
gies due to macroion-microion interaction as well as due
to microion-microion interaction become smaller in mag-
nitude when the k-th microion is moved away but the
energy due to the external ﬁeld becomes larger in mag-
nitude.

[35] Note that this state is not globally stable even though
it is the state of lowest energy. In contrast to Sec. III,
where no energy barriers existed, they do now.

We present a method to search low energy conﬁgurations of polar molecules in the complex poten-
tial energy surfaces associated with dense ﬂuids. The search is done in the conﬁgurational space of
the translational and rotational degrees of freedom of the molecule, combining steepest-descent and
Newton-Raphson steps which embed information on the average sizes of the potential energy wells
obtained from prior inspection of the liquid structure. We perform a molecular dynamics simula-
tion of a liquid water shell which demonstrates that the method enables fast and energy-controlled
water molecule insertion in aqueous environments. The algorithm ﬁnds low energy conﬁgurations
of incoming water molecules around three orders of magnitude faster than direct random insertion.
This method is an important step towards dynamic simulations of open systems and it may also
prove useful for energy-biased ensemble average calculations of the chemical potential.

Many processes of physical, chemical and biological
interest involve open systems which exchange matter
with their surroundings. Molecular dynamics (MD) and
Monte Carlo (MC) simulations of these systems often
require a method for molecule insertion and, therefore,
a method for searching conﬁgurations with prescribed
(low) potential energy.
Indeed, a randomly placed
molecule is likely to overlap with pre-existing atoms, re-
leasing into the system a very high amount of energy.

The most natural setting for these systems is the grand
canonical (GC) ensemble. Several methods for GC sim-
ulations require the location of energy cavities for inser-
tion (such as cavity-biased methods for GCMC1,2,3) or
careful control of the solvent insertion energy in the case
of GCMD4,5. Mass, momentum and energy transfer are
also a key feature of a class of hybrid methods for non-
equilibrium simulations which couple an open MD region
with an interfacing continuum-ﬂuid-dynamics domain6,7.
Open boundaries in such hybrid schemes can avoid ﬁnite
size eﬀects in small MD simulation boxes8, thereby saving
on computational time. These sort of open boundaries
could also be used to improve the closed “water shells”
widely used to hydrate restricted subdomains9 in many
MD simulations of biological systems.

Water insertion is also particularly important in pro-
tein simulations. For instance, it is possible to study pro-
tein unfolding via gradual water insertion in the protein’s
cavities10,11. On the other hand, water molecules buried
in protein cavities at very low energies are essential for
protein structure and function12,13,14. Indeed, some tools
for MD simulations (such as dowser12) are specialised
for water insertion in hydrophilic cavities, leaving empty
however the larger hydrophobic cavities which frequently
contain stable yet disordered water molecules relevant to
protein function13,15.

Several methods for the calculation of ensemble aver-
ages require sampling the potential energy released to the
system upon insertion of a test molecule1,16,17,18. Exam-
ples include calculation of the chemical potential, hydra-

tion energies and pair distribution functions19. The ap-
plicability of these methods can be expanded to dense ﬂu-
ids using techniques that bias the sampling towards low
energy conﬁgurations. Some of these techniques, such as
cavity-biased20,21 or excluded volume map22 sampling,
are however hampered by the considerable amount of
time needed to ﬁnd “cavities” where the test molecule
could be inserted without overlapping with others.
In
fact, these cavities are just proxies to search low energy
conﬁgurations which could better be identiﬁed by an en-
ergy controlled insertion method.

The algorithms for water insertion proposed in the lit-
erature usually involve rather lengthy steps which com-
prise three separate parts: location of a suitable “cavity”,
normally using an expensive grid search with O(106) dif-
ferent cells3,4,21; random insertion in the cavity, followed
by a large number of energy minimisation steps (either of
the inserted molecule4,12 or of the entire system10) and,
ﬁnally, thermostatting the whole system over a one to ten
picoseconds period to extract the extra energy released
upon insertion. In this article, we present a method to
locate low energy conﬁgurations of dense liquids that al-
lows insertion of solvent molecules on-the-ﬂy: avoiding
expensive grid search, non-local energy minimisation and
thermostatting steps.

On the potential energy surface, low energies are lo-
cated inside energy wells whose local minima span a rel-
atively large range of energy values. The main idea of
the present method is to reconstruct the energy land-
scape with a limited number of probes by constraining
the search to be inside the energy wells. In fact, any ex-
cursion outside the explored well implies the loss of all the
information accumulated on the current well which is ef-
fectively equivalent to a random restart. Eﬃciency is ob-
tained by minimising both the number of probes needed
to determine if the target energy is found within the
well and the number of explored wells per successful in-
sertion. The present minimisation algorithm generalises
non-trivially to multiple degrees of freedom the usher al-

gorithm for insertion of Lennard-Jones atoms23. It shares
with some other global minimisation methods the recipe
of applying in turns random moves and local energy
minimisation24,25,26. However, it is distinguished from
these others in the way the minimisation is performed via
a combined steepest-descent and Newton-Raphson iter-
ator which is tailored adaptively to the structure of the
potential energy landscape being searched.

The method uses local information on the gradient
and the average size of the potential wells, which are
dependent on the molecule’s location and the thermody-
namic state respectively. The input parameters specify
the maximum distance ∆R and rotation angle ∆Θ that
the incoming molecule can jump without exiting the cur-
rent well together with a measure of the roughness of the
potential energy surface ∆ER. The insertion algorithm
starts by selecting a random location for the centre of
mass of the molecule and placing the atoms at the equi-
librium bond and angle positions in a random orienta-
tion. The non-bonded potential energy of an incoming
molecule is given by

U =

VLJ (rij ) +

VC (rij ),

(1)

1
2 X

i6=j

2 X

i6=j

where VLJ and VC are the Lennard-Jones and Coulomb
pair potentials respectively1 and the index i runs over
the atoms of the molecule and j over all other atoms,
which remain ﬁxed while inserting. The energy E =
2U released to the system upon insertion is computed
and compared with the target energy ET . The insertion
succeeds once the energy diﬀerence ∆E = E − ET is
less than a certain prescribed tolerance set here at 10−3
Kcal/mol.

It is likely that for the random starting conﬁguration
∆E will be a large positive value because there is a high
chance that the inserted molecule will overlap with oth-
ers. Then, the force F = Pi Fi applied to the centre
of mass rcm and torque τ = Pi rcm,i × Fi are used
to compute the next displacement and rotation. Here,
the index i runs over the atoms of the inserted molecule
and rcm,i = ri − rcm. The molecule is translated by
δr = min(∆E/F, ∆R) where F is the magnitude of the
force on the centre of mass and ∆R is the maximum
displacement. With the reference system ﬁxed to the
molecule, we then compute the rotation angle around
the torque axis δθ = min(∆E/τ, ∆Θ) and rotate the
molecule around the centre of mass. The resulting up-
date rule is ﬁnally given by

where R is the rotation matrix around the axis of torque
of angle δθ. This is equivalent to a ﬁrst order steep-
est descent procedure for large energy diﬀerences and a
second order Newton method for energy close to the tar-
get energy23. The angular minimisation is stopped when

FIG. 1: Contour plot of the potential energy landscape in
Kcal/mol: (a) for translation relative to the axes i and j ﬁxed
to the water molecule; (b) for a rotation θ about the axis j
and φ about the axis k for an equilibrated periodic liquid wa-
ter system at 300K and density 0.96 g/cm3. The maximum
translational displacement ∆R = 1.0 ˚A and maximum rota-
tional angles ∆Θ = ∆Φ = 45◦ are indicated by double-headed
arrows. For visual convenience angles smaller than −90◦ and
larger than 90◦ in θ are plotted although being redundant.

the angle δθ is less than 1◦ to avoid oscillations due to
the coupling of rotational and translational degrees of
freedom. If during the iterations ∆E increases by more
than ∆ER then the current attempt is abandoned and a
new random conﬁguration is generated. This provides a
threshold to control the amount of time spent searching
in the well and the number of wells explored.

The insertion algorithm in Eq. (2) does not require
a baroque implementation and indeed can be easily in-
cluded in any molecular dynamics program. The code
used here is based on the serial version of a well estab-
lished parallel molecular dynamics code NAMD with the
Charmm27 force ﬁeld27, but it has been designed to in-
terface easily with any other serial or parallel MD code.
The search algorithm applies in general to small polar
molecules but given its importance we focus on controlled
insertion of water molecules in aqueous environments.
We use the TIP3P model for water, widely utilised in
biological simulations28. This water model is based on
three interaction sites, bonds (O-H) and angle (H-O-H)
being constrained rigidly or, in its ﬂexible version (used
here), by a harmonic potential with equilibrium conﬁgu-
rations of 0.96 ˚A and 104.52◦ respectively.

As stated, the restriction on the maximum displace-
ment and rotation has the eﬀect of limiting the search
to the current potential well. For water, the maximum
displacement can be extracted from the oxygen-hydrogen
28. We found that an op-
pair distribution function gOH
timum value for the maximum displacement ∆R = 1 ˚A
is half of the ﬁrst peak in gOH which is around 2 ˚A. Ex-
ploring the potential energy landscape provides another
simple way of obtaining the input parameters. In Fig. 1a,
we show a cross-section of the potential energy surface for
a displacement of up to 5 ˚A around an equilibrated water
molecule in the direction of the axes i and j. The unit
vectors i, j, k form a reference system ﬁxed rigidly to the
water molecule with the axis i being in the direction of

the dipole. As shown in Fig. 1a the optimum value of ∆R
is approximately the radius of the potential energy well,
corroborating information furnished from the pair distri-
bution function. It is more diﬃcult to obtain structural
information for the angular degrees of freedom. However,
a simple inspection of Fig. 1b provides a gross estimate of
potential energy wells in the rotational degrees of freedom
as being between 90 − 100◦ wide; therefore the maximum
rotation can be ﬁxed at ∆Θ = 45◦. The value of ∆ER,
which sets the maximum uphill energy jump allowed in
one move, is important to reduce the number of unsuc-
cessful wells explored. We found that an optimal value
is near ∆ER = 3 Kcal/mol.

It is well known that the local structure of liquid wa-
ter at equilibrium consists of a hydrogen bond network
formed by oxygen and hydrogen atoms from neighbour-
ing water molecules. This structure makes it very hard
for an incoming water molecule to ﬁnd low energy con-
ﬁgurations by forming hydrogen bonds with pre-existing
molecules. However, the insertion algorithm needs only
to control the thermodynamics by inputting into the sys-
tem a speciﬁed amount of energy which depends on the
ensemble considered. We performed an MD simulation of
bulk water using a simple spherical water shell to show
that it is possible to insert water molecules on-the-ﬂy
while precisely controlling the energy released to the sys-
In a previous work23 considering Lennard-Jones
tem.
atoms, it was shown that this procedure ensures thermo-
dynamic consistency after a relaxation time of the order
of the collision time. We set up an equilibrated TIP3P
bulk water system within a sphere of radius 37.5 ˚A at
300K and a pressure of 1 atm. The simulations were run
with a 12 ˚A cutoﬀ radius and without corrections to the
long ranged electrostatic forces27. The water molecules
in the outer shell of length d = 12.5 ˚A play the role of a
reservoir conﬁned in the sphere by a simple constant ra-
dial force ﬁeld speciﬁed by an acceleration g acting only
within the outer shell. The eﬀect of this force is a linear
decay of the pressure in the water shell according to the
usual formula for the hydrostatic pressure in an incom-
pressible ﬂuid P1 = P0 − ρgd, where P1 is the pressure at
the surface of the water sphere and P0 is the pressure of
the bulk that we want to maintain. We impose P1 = 0
by setting g = P0/(ρd).

In the present set up, the ﬂow rate of molecules to
the inner shell is controlled by the applied pressure force,
while the number of reservoir molecules in the outer shell
is ﬁxed at the bulk density. This implies that molecules
which, due to ﬂuctuations or sudden pressure waves,
move outside the sphere are removed and reinserted using
the insertion method at a random location in the outer
shell, with a velocity given by the Maxwell-Boltzmann
distribution at 300K. We note that the present setting
can be generalised to avoid ﬁnite-size eﬀects due to pe-
riodic boundary conditions in a hydrodynamically con-
sistent way6. The total energy of the system can be
ﬁxed by setting the amount of energy released upon inser-
tion equal to the energy lost when a molecule moves out

FIG. 2: Number of energy evaluations per molecule required
to insert a water molecule while releasing an energy less than
E (Kcal/mol) to the system. The proposed insertion algo-
rithm (crosses) is around three orders of magnitude faster
than random insertion (circles) at low energies. The his-
togram for random insertion is computed from 107 trials.

through the open boundary6. On average, the exchanged
potential energy per molecule is equal to the mean en-
ergy per molecule: by inserting at this energy target we
kept the total energy under control (without drift) with
no thermostat at all. In other situations, such as at con-
stant temperature, it is suﬃcient to release a moderately
greater energy, for example equal to the excess chemical
potential, which can be thermalized dynamically by the
thermostat.

An estimate of the eﬃciency of this insertion method
can be obtained by determining the average number of
energy evaluations, including failed well searches, needed
to insert a single water molecule at the speciﬁed energy.
Each iteration of the insertion algorithm corresponds to
one energy evaluation on the solvent molecule, which is
a three atom-force calculation for TIP3P water. In par-
ticular, it takes an average of 206 iterations, exploring 34
wells, to insert at the reference energy of the mean energy
per molecule (−11 Kcal/mol), and 36 iterations (only 6
wells) at the energy of the excess chemical potential (-
5.8 Kcal/mol, calculated using the Bennett method16).
We note that the computational cost required by the
insertion method in a typical MD simulation is quite
small. For instance, in the simulation of the open water
shell mentioned above, incoming water molecules were
inserted at a target energy of ET = −11Kcal/mol within
a volume of 155.4nm3 at a rate of 141 per picosecond.
The amount of CPU time devoted to insertion was only
3% of the grand total of the simulation.

Interestingly, the mean number of iterations to explore
a well which leads to the correct target energy is only
around 12, independent of the target energy. The method
may be improved further by reducing the total number of
searched wells but it is already optimal in the sense that
the number of iterations to explore a single well does
not depend on the target energy. Future applications

4

may require searching many more degrees of freedom,
e.g. conformational searches, for which it is impractical
to ﬁx each maximum displacement a priori. In this case,
it would be useful to set up an adaptive rule to infer the
input parameters from the eﬃcacy of the search itself.

E

It is useful to compare our insertion algorithm with a
direct random insertion. To this end, the probability dis-
tribution f (E) of releasing a total energy E upon random
insertion was estimated by computing a histogram from
107 random insertion trials. The number of trials re-
quired to obtain an energy smaller than E is given by the
reciprocal of the cumulative distribution 1/F (E) where
−∞ f (E′)dE′. This number is compared with
F (E) = R
the number of iterations (energy evaluations) required by
the insertion algorithm in Fig. (2). The insertion algo-
rithm is around three orders of magnitude faster than
a random insertion for energies lower than the chemical
potential and so may provide an eﬃcient alternative to bi-
ased methods, such as cavity-biased sampling20,21, to re-
construct the probability distribution f (E). Indeed, the
present algorithm enables one to identify the important
low energy regions very accurately where an un-biased
sampling can be performed. This appealing approach
enables fast computation of the chemical potential from
the probability distribution f (E) at low energies29.

In summary, we have reported a new method for the

insertion of polar molecules in dense ﬂuids by a gener-
alisation of the usher protocol23. The energy minimi-
sation is applied concurrently to all degrees of freedom
(translational and rotational for water) and is indepen-
dent of the speciﬁc potential used. Indeed, the method
is even more general. It may be applied to other prob-
lems related to conformational searches and minima of
potential energy surfaces with many more degrees free-
dom. Given its importance for computational biology,
we focused on water and demonstrated that it is possible
to eﬃciently insert water molecules in aqueous environ-
ments while controlling the thermodynamic state. This
task is commonly considered to be very time consuming,
but we are able to achieve it at negligible computational
cost thanks to a very eﬃcient conﬁgurational search al-
gorithm. The present algorithm is an essential tool for
performing hybrid MD-continuum simulations6,8 of bio-
logical interest. Indeed, it represents an important step
towards a general method for performing MD simulations
of open systems, for which a dynamic calculation of the
chemical potential18,29 could be used to control the inser-
tion rate so as to maintain constant the solvent chemical
potential.

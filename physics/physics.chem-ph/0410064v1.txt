Discussing the Relationship between the Static
and Dynamic Light Scattering

Yong Sun

November 13, 2012

Abstract

Both the static (SLS) and dynamic (DLS) light scatterings obtain the
information from the scattered intensity, but the size information is dif-
ferent. In this paper, the relationship between SLS and DLS is discussed
based on dilute water dispersions of two diﬀerent homogenous spherical
particles, polystyrene latexes and poly(N -isopropylacrylamide) microgels,
with a simple assumption when Rayleigh-Gans-Debye approximation is
valid. With the assistance of the simulated data, what the apparent hy-
drodynamic radius means has been discussed. The results show that the
apparent hydrodynamic radius is diﬀerent with the mean hydrodynamic
radius of particles and is a composite size obtained from averaging the
in the static size distribution G (Rs) with the weight
term exp

In general, the structural information and mass weight are included in the
relationship between the average scattered intensity and the scattering angle.
Measuring this dependence is called the static light scattering (SLS). The
analysis of the time auto-correlation of the scattered intensity can provide the
dynamic information of particles, called the dynamic light scattering (DLS).
SLS obtains the information from the optical feature and DLS gains the infor-
mation from both the optical and hydrodynamic characteristics of particles. If
the relationship between the optical and hydrodynamic features of particles can
be built, the experimental information of the normalized time auto-correlation
function of the intensity of the scattered light g(2) (τ ) can be expected by using
the size information obtained from SLS. In this article, the relationship between
the SLS and DLS for homogenous spherical particles will be discussed with a
simple assumption when Rayleigh-Gans-Debye (RGD) approximation is valid.
For homogeneous spherical particles where the RGD approximation is valid,
the normalized time auto-correlation function of the electric ﬁeld of the scattered
light g(1) (τ ) is given by

here η0, kB, T and Rh are the viscosity of the solvent, Boltzmann’s constant,

If we simply assume that the relationship between the static and hydrody-

namic radii is given by

Rh = aRs,

where a is a constant, with the function between the normalized time auto-
correlation function of the intensity of the scattered light g(2) (τ ) and the nor-

the relationship between the static and dynamic light scattering is built and the
values of the normalized time auto-correlation function of the intensity of the
scattered light g(2) (τ ) can be expected.

In this paper, the calculated and experimental values of g(2) (τ ) of two sam-
ples were compared. One is the polystyrene latex sample with the normalized
size information: the mean radius is 33.5 nm and the standard deviation is 2.5
nm provided by the supplier, from Interfacial Dynamics Corporation (Portland,
Oregon). The other is the poly(N -isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) microgel
-methylenebisacrylamide
sample with the molar ratio 1% of crosslinker N, N
over N -isopropylacrylamide. The size information was obtained by ﬁtting the
static light scattering. At the temperature 29oC, the mean static radius is
254.3

0.1nm, the standard deviation is 21.5

0.3nm and χ2 is 2.15 [2] .

′

If the constant a for the polystyrene latex sample is assumed to be 1.1 and
the size information provided by the supplier is thought to be consistent with
that obtained from SLS, all the experimental and calculated values of g(2) (τ )
at the scattering angles 30o, 60o, 90o, 120o and 150o are shown in Fig. 1.a.

When the constant a for the PNIPAM sample is assumed to be 1.21, all the
experimental and calculated values at the scattering angles 30o, 50o and 70o are
shown in Fig. 1.b. Figure 1 shows that the calculated values are consistent with
the experimental data very well.

If the static radius is thought to be equal to the hydrodynamic radius as
Bargeron think [3], all the experimental and calculated values of g(2) (τ ) for
the polystyrene latex sample at the scattering angles 30o, 60o, 90o, 120o and
150o are shown in Fig. 2.a; all the experimental and calculated values for the
PNIPAM sample at the scattering angles 30o, 50o and 70o are shown in Fig.
2.b. Figure 2 shows that the expected values have large diﬀerences with the
experimental data.

Traditionally the size information is obtained from DLS. The standard method
is the Cumulant or the inverse Laplace transform. For the ﬁve experimental
data of g(2) (τ ) measured under the same conditions with the SLS data, the
ﬁve ﬁt results of g(2) (τ ) by using the ﬁrst Cumulant and ﬁrst two Cumulant
[4, 5] respectively for the PNIPAM microgel sample at temperature 29oC and
the scattering angle 30oare listed in Table 1.

From the ﬁt results, the values of the mean decay constant

show the inde-
pendence on the measurements, but the results of µ2 have a strong dependence
on the measurements. The values of µ2 are often negative. It’s a contradiction
with its deﬁnition. In order to discuss this problem conveniently, the simulated
data will be used.

The simulated data were produced by using the size information: the mean
static radius is 260 nm and the standard deviation is 26 nm. the temperature
T was set to 302.33K, the viscosity of the solvent η0 was 0.8132 mPa S, the
scattering angle was 30o and the constant a was chosen as 1.2. When the data
of
/β was obtained, the 1% statistical noise was added and the
random errors were set 3%. Five simulated data were produced respectively.
The ﬁt results of the ﬁve simulated data by using the ﬁrst Cumulant and ﬁrst
two Cumulant respectively are shown in Table 2.

From the ﬁt results of the simulated data that are shown in Table 2, the
situation is the same with the real experimental data, the values of the mean
decay constant
show the independence on the diﬀerent noises and errors
and the results of µ2 have strong dependences on them. The values of µ2
can be negative. As we have discussed, a truncated Gaussian distribution can
give better results for the static light scattering of the PNIPAM sample at
temperature 29oC [2], so the ﬁve simulated data were produced respectively
again with the truncated Gaussian distribution that the range of integral was 221
to 299 nm. The ﬁt results of the ﬁve simulated data by using the ﬁrst Cumulant
and ﬁrst two Cumulant respectively are shown in Table 3. The conclusion is
the same that the values of the quantity µ2 have large diﬀerences for diﬀerent
simulated data and are often negative.

Comparing the ﬁt results by using the ﬁrst Cumulant with the values by
using the ﬁrst two Cumulant for the experimental and simulated data, the val-
ues of the mean decay constant can be thought to be equal. In order to avoid
the contradiction that the values of µ2 are often negative, the apparent hy-
drodynamic radius is obtained by using the ﬁrst Cumulant. Meanwhile from
the analysis of Cumulant method, the apparent hydrodynamic radius is ob-
q2Dτ
tained from the average of the term exp
in distribution G (Rs) with
the weight R6
sP (q, Rs). In order to explore the eﬀects of the distribution, the
simulated data were produced as the above simulated data with the same mean
static radius 260 nm and the diﬀerent standard deviations 13, 39 and 52 nm
respectively. The constant a is still chosen 1.2. From this assumption, the mean
hydrodynamic radius should be 312 nm. The ﬁt results for diﬀerent standard
deviations are listed in Table 4.

Table 4 The apparent hydrodynamic radii of the simulated data produced
by using the same mean static radius and diﬀerent standard deviations.

From the results of apparent hydrodynamic radius, the values are appar-
ently aﬀected by the values of standard deviation. As shown in Eq. 1, the
quantity exp
is determined by the hydrodynamic feature of particles
while R6
sP (q, Rs) is determined by the optical feature of particles. As a result,

g(2) (τ ) is determined by both the optical and hydrodynamic characteristics.
When the Cumulant method is used, the apparent hydrodynamic radius Rh ob-
tain from the normalized time auto-correlation function of the intensity of the
scattered light g(2) (τ ) is a composite size. If the simple size information need to
be obtained from g(2) (τ ), the relation between the optical and hydrodynamic
features of particles must be considered. The accurate relationship between the
static and hydrodynamic radii can be further explored.

correlation function of the intensity of the scattered light g(2) (τ ). Figures 1.a

culated values with the simple assumption Rh = aRs.

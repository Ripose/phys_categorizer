Abstract

Optical properties of symmetry-forbidden π-π∗ transitions in benzene are calculated
with the time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT), using an adiabatic LDA
functional. Quantities calculated are the envelopes of the Franck-Condon factors of
the vibrationally promoted transitions and the associated oscillator strengths. The
strengths, which span three orders of magnitude, are reproduced to better than a factor
of two by the theory. Comparable agreement is found for the Franck-Condon widths.
We conclude that rather detailed information can be obtained with the TDDFT and it
may be worthwhile to explore other density functionals.

The time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) has proven to be a surprisingly
successful theory of excitations and particularly the optical absorption strength function.
The theory is now being widely applied in both chemistry and in condensed matter physics.
The literature in quantum chemistry is cited in a recent study on the electronic excitations
in benzene [1]. Benzene is an interesting molecule for testing approximations because its
spectra have been very well characterized, both electronic and vibrational. In this note we
will apply the TDDFT to coupling between vibrational and electronic excitations. In our
previous studies, we have investigated many diﬀerent electronic structure questions using a
rather simple version of the density functional theory, the local density approximation (LDA).
Our emphasis has been to study the overall predictive power of a ﬁxed functional rather than
to try to ﬁnd the best functional for each properties. The approximation scheme we consider
is straightforward and uses the same computer programs as for calculating purely electronic
excitations. We treat the electronic dynamics in the adiabatic approximation, taking the
same energy function for the dynamic equation as is used in the static structure calculation.
In our view, this is the only consistent scheme available that guarantees conservation of the
oscillator sum rule. The electron-vibration coupling is treated in a vertical approximation,
so only information at frozen nuclear coordinates is required.

Figure 1: Electronic excitations of benzene in the π-π∗ manifold. Besides the experimental
data and the present TDDFT, we show the TDDFT of ref. [1] and the CI calculation of ref.
[2]

We consider only spin-singlet states in this work and drop the spin designation in labeling
the states. Empirically, the lowest states derive from the π-π∗ manifold, exciting an electron
from the two-fold degenerate e1g HOMO orbital to the two-fold degenerate e2u orbital. The
four states consist of a strongly absorbing two-fold degenerate E1u excitation and two other
states, B1u and B2u, for which symmetry forbids any transition strength. This basic spectrum
is shown in Fig. 1, comparing also with our TDDFT calculation, the TDDFT calculation of
ref. [1], and the CI theory of ref. [2].

It is seen that the TDDFT gives an excellent account of the energies. In fact the TDDFT
gives a good description of the higher frequency absorption including σ-σ∗ transitions as
well [3]. The detailed optical properties of the three transitions have been studied gas phase
absorption [4, 5]. The strong transition is the E1u with f = 0.9 − 0.95. The B1u mode is
seen as a shoulder on the strong E1u peak. Its total transition strength is about a factor of
10 lower than the strong state; ref. [4] quotes a value f = 0.09. The B2u transition is very
weak and is seen as a partially resolved set of vibrational transitions with a total strength
about f ≈ 1.3 × 10−3[4]. The strength associated with the most prominent resolved states is
0.6 × 10−3[5].
The vibrational couplings of the B states has been recently studied using the CASSCF
method and analytic expressions for the linear coupling to vibrations[6], and we shall compare
with their results. The TDDFT includes correlation eﬀects in a diﬀerent way, and has some
well-known advantages such as the automatic conservation of required sum rules. Also, as
mentioned earlier, the present method does not require any reprogramming.

For our treatment of the vibrational motion, we assume that the the vibrations are har-

by an orthogonal transformation U to obtain the normal modes Qk and the eigenfrequencies

is the r.m.s. amplitude of the zero-point motion1. The last equality expresses the formula in
common units with ncm = c/ν the energy of the vibration in wavenumbers [cm−1].

The optical absorption strength function in the presence of the zero point motion is
determined by the convolution the probability distribution of displacements with the strength
calculated as a function of displacement,

f = Z dN QkP ( ~Q)f ( ~Q).

(3)

We thus need the absorption strength as a function of the normal mode coordinates Qk. In
the case of a forbidden transition promoted by the vibration k, the coupling is linear for small
displacements and the transition strength will be quadratic in Qk,

f (Qk) = f0k

We verify below that this functional dependence is satisﬁed for the couplings of interest in
benzene. Then the convolution over the ground state probability distribution gives simply
f = f0k.

We also consider widths of the transitions due to the Franck-Condon factors of multiply
excited vibrations. This is calculated by replacing f with the strength function S(E, Q) =
f (Q)δ(E − E(Q)) in eq. 3. Assuming that the excitation energy is linear in Q,

E(Qk) ≈ E0 + KkQk/Q0k + ...

the Gaussian probability distribution P gives a Gaussian envelope for the Franck-Condon
factors,

Figure 2: Cartesian displacements of the vibrational modes 6a (left) and 8a (right). These
modes have symmetry E2g and give the most important couplings for our purposes. The
r.m.s. displacement of the atoms are magniﬁed by a factor 40, i.e. Qk = 40Q0k with respect
to the scale for the equilibrium positions.

For the numerical studies reported here, we constructed the transformation matrix U
using the empirical force ﬁeld of Goodman and Ozkabak [7], which ﬁts the observed frequen-
cies extremely well. Ab initio calculations of the force ﬁeld have also reached a high level of
accuracy [9]. However, as mentioned earlier, we do not make our own DFT calculations of the
force constants because our goal is the dynamic behavior of the electrons. The frequencies
and symmetries of the normal modes are listed in Table 1, taken from ref.
[7]. The most
important modes for the induced transition strengths are the E2g and the B2g modes2. The
E2g vibrations couple the strong electronic excitation to the other states in the π-π∗ mani-
fold. The B1g can induce out-of-plane dipole strength for these excitations. The theoretical
widths of the excitations are largely due to mode 1, which is an A1g radial oscillation mode
that favors carbon displacements. In Fig. 2 we show the Cartesian displacements associated
with the two strongest E2g modes with respect to carbon displacements.

The present TDDFT calculations were performed making use of the same representation
of the Kohn-Sham operator as in our previous study of the full energy distribution in optical
absorption [3]. The wave functions are represented on a coordinate-space mesh as has been
introduced in condensed matter physics [?]. However, the algorithm in the present program
is a new one [10] that uses the conjugate gradient method to extract individual states rather
that the direct real-time propagation of the wave function. While the real-time method is very
eﬃcient for calculating the global strength function, it is less suited for locating individual
eigenstates when they are weakly excited by the dipole operator.
In both methods, the
electronic ground state for a given nuclear geometry is ﬁrst computed with the Kohn-Sham

2The B1g symmetry would also give couplings between the electronic states, but there are no vibrations

of that symmetry.

We use a simple LDA energy density functional [12] for the electron-electron interaction in V
and a pseudopotential approximation [13, 14] to treat the interaction of the valence electrons
with the ions. The important numerical parameters in the calculation are the the mesh
spacing, taken as ∆x = 0.3 ˚A, and the volume in which the wave functions are calculated,
which we take as a sphere of radius 7 ˚A. With these parameters, orbital energies are converged
to better than 0.05 eV. Next the TDDFT equations are solved in an representation similar

The equations are solved by the conjugate gradient method for the generalized eigenvalue
problem [11]. In Fig. 4 we show the dependence of transition strengths f and excitation
energies ω on the coordinates of two of the normal modes. We see that the conditions for
applying eq. (4) and (5) are reasonably well satisﬁed. We may then extract the transition
strength f0k and the width Kk by ﬁtting the Qk-dependence of these quantities. The results
for the symmetry-allowed vibrations are shown in shown in Table 2.

We ﬁrst discuss the widths. The empirical values were obtained by making a three-term
Gaussian ﬁt to the absorption data of ref. [15]. The only vibrations that contribute in lowest

5

order are the two A1g breathing modes. The vibrations aﬀect all three transitions identically;
mode 1 has the larger amplitude of displacement of the carbon atoms and gives the greater
contribution. The results agree rather well with the empirical widths. The magnitude of the
widths and its independence of the electronic state can be understood in very simple terms
with the Hueckel model. This is to be expected, since the excitation energy of the electronic
states is mainly due to the orbital energy diﬀerence, and that is describe quite well by the
Hueckel model. For benzene, the energy diﬀerence is related to the hopping matrix element β
by ELU M O − EHOM O = 2β.. Allowing changes in the nuclear coordinates, the hopping matrix
element will depend on the distance between neighboring atoms d; this may be parameterized
by the form

d !α
β(d) = β0  d0

.

Then the HOMO-LUMO gap ﬂuctuates due to the breathing mode vibrations with widths
given by

∆E = 2β0α

∆r
r

where r is the radial distance of the carbons from the center and ∆r is at Qk = Q0k in
an A1g mode. From ﬁtting orbital energies in various conjugated carbon systems one may
extract values α ≈ 2.7 and β0 = 2.5 eV[3]. Inserting these values in the above equation, one
obtains 0.145 eV for the widths associated with mode 1, quite close to the values obtained by
TDDFT. We have included in the table also the r.m.s. widths of the Franck-Condon factors
obtained by the CASSCF theory, which gives quite similar results. One thing should be
remarked on the comparison with experiment. While the theory gives practically identical
widths for all three states, the experimental strength is signiﬁcantly narrower for the the E1u
excitation, and this seems to not be understandable in the TDDFT.

Next we examine the transition strengths of the B-transitions induced by the zero-point
vibational motion. In the middle table of Table 2 we show the contributions by the six active
vibrational modes. The main contribution for the B2u transition comes from mode 6. This
is also found in the CASSCF theory, and is how the observed spectrum was interpreted in
[5]. In the case of the B1u excitation, the TDDFT predicts that the coupling of mode 8 is
dominant. Experimentally, the situation is unclear because the vibrational spectrum of the
excited state is strongly perturbed. Ref.
[5] assigns both mode 6 and mode 8 vibrational
involvement. Irrespective of the spectrum of the vibrational modes in the excited state, the
total transition strength is given by the same convolution of the ground state vibrational wave
function. As in the case of the widths, the induced B1u transition strength can be understood
roughly with the tight-binding model. The charge densities are displaced in the vibration,
giving the B1u conﬁguration an induced dipole moment just from the atomic geometry. The
Hueckel Hamiltonian of the orbital energy is also aﬀected by the changed separations between
carbons, and that cause a violation of the B1u symmetry. Finally, the Coulomb interaction,
which is mainly responsible for the splitting of the three electronic states, is aﬀected by the
changed separations. Of these three mechanisms, only the eﬀect of the symmetry-violation in
the Hueckel Hamiltonian is important, and mode 8 crries the largest ﬂutuation in d. Taking
the same d-dependence as before, the strength obtained in the tight-binding model is 0.05,
rather close to the TDDFT result. The tight-binding model cannot be used to estimate the
very weak B2u transition because the charge density on the atoms is identically zero.

The lower table gives the empirical transition strengths [4] and comparison to theory.
The agreement between theory and experiment is quite good for all states. For the weakest
transition, the B1u, the TDDFT gives a transition strength 25% higher than the empirical
For the case of the B1u transition, the TDDFT prediction is within 35% of the measured
value. We also show the previously reported value for the E1u which is within 20%. We
consider this remarkable success of the TDDFT considering that the strengths that range
over three orders of magnitude.

In conclusion, we have shown that the TDDFT gives a semiquantitative account of the
eﬀect of zero-point vibrational motion on the optical absorption spectrum in benzene. In this
respect this extends the possible domain of utility from the region of infrared absorption,
where it is known that the TDDFT gives a description of transition strengths accurate to a
factor of two or so[16]. We are encouraged by these results to apply the TDDFT to other
problems involving the electron-vibrational coupling. Perhaps it should be mentioned that
not all excitation properties are reproduced so well in the TDDFT. In particular, one can not
expect accurate numbers for HOMO-LUMO gap of insulators [18] and the optical rotatory
power of chiral molecules [19]. Of course, there may be better energy functionals for studying
particular properties, and it might be interesting to examine theories including gradient terms
in the functional.

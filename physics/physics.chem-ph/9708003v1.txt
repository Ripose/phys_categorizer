The optimized random phase approximation (ORPA) for classical liquids is re-examined in the
framework of the generating functional approach to the integral equations. We show that the two
main variants of the approximation correspond to the addition of the same correction to two diﬀerent
ﬁrst order approximations of the homogeneous liquid free energy. Furthermore, we show that it
is possible to consistently use the ORPA with arbitrary reference systems described by continuous
potentials and that the same approximation is equivalent to a particular extremum condition for the
corresponding generating functional. Finally, it is possible to enforce the thermodynamic consistence
between the thermal and the virial route to the equation of state by requiring the global extremum
condition on the generating functional.

I. INTRODUCTION

The optimized random phase approximation (ORPA) [1] for classical liquids has been extensively used in the last
decades to obtain information on the structure and, to a minor extent, on the thermodynamics of simple liquids
and mostly liquid metals [1–6]. The approximation was originally developed in the context of the perturbative
approach to the thermodynamic and structure of simple liquids [1]. More recently, this approximation has been used
as ingredient for studying liquids in porous media [7] and critical phenomena in simple liquids [8]. The standard
implementation of ORPA is based on the splitting of the interparticle potential into a repulsive (reference) and an
attractive (perturbation) part. The eﬀect of the attraction on the pair correlation functions of the purely repulsive
reference system is treated at the level of the random phase approximation (RPA) at large distances and by enforcing
the excluded volume eﬀect at short distances.

Numerical studies have shown that the ORPA yields a very accurate description of the structure factor and ther-
modynamics of simple ﬂuids. At present, for simple liquids, the quality of the ORPA results is comparable to that of
state-of-the-art calculations based on the modiﬁed hypernetted chain (MHNC) approximation [9,10] or other modern
integral equations like the HMSA [11].

Usually, the reference system is modeled by hard sphere interactions. However, in some cases, either the nature
of the interactions or results from other theoretical approaches, indicate that a soft reference system could provide a
better reference system for the ORPA. The original derivation of the ORPA does not allow a direct extension of the
formulae to the case of a reference system interacting without hard core. A non-standard implementation for liquid
alkali metals using a one component plasma as reference system [6], although providing good results, was not general
enough and was subject to some criticisms [12].

More recently, motivated by the need of improving some variational calculations for liquid metals [13], we reviewed
the ORPA from the computational as well from the theoretical point of view. In a previous paper [14], we showed
that the solution of the ORPA equations is unique and we proposed a new robust, accurate and eﬃcient numerical
algorithm to solve the equations. In the present paper we address the problem of reformulating the theory in order

1

to deal in a consistent way with continuous reference systems without any intermediate introduction of auxiliary
hard-sphere systems [1]. We give a solution to this problem in the same spirit of Gillan’s extension of the mean
spherical approximation for soft potentials [15] and subsequent elaborations by Rosenfeld [16].

We found useful to recast the ORPA equations in the framework of the generating functionals for the integral
equations of the theory of liquids [17]. We show that the two diﬀerent ﬁrst-order expansions of the free energy
functional corresponding to the well known Gibbs-Bogolioubov and Weeks-Chandler and Andersen approximations
for the free energy [18] can be transformed into two closely related forms of the ORPA by addition of the same
functional. The resulting correlation functions diﬀer by the choice of the reference system pair correlation function.
Moreover, we are able to show that our condition for a continuous ORPA correction to the pair correlations is
equivalent to an extremum condition for the ORPA generating functional. Since only the variational determination
of all the free parameters of the functional allows the identiﬁcation of its value with the Helmoltz free energy, this
choice enforces the thermodynamic consistence in a natural way.

The paper is organized as follows.

In section 2, we show how two versions of the ORPA diﬀering only in the
treatment of the reference system correlations can be obtained from a variational problem for two related functionals.
In section 3 we show that it is possible to deﬁne a consistent ORPA for continuous potentials and that such an
extension is equivalent to an additional requirement of extremum for the ORPA functionals. In section 4 the issue of
the thermodynamic consistence of the two approximations is brieﬂy discussed. Conclusions are summarized in section
5.

II. TWO GENERATING FUNCTIONALS FOR THE ORPA

The starting point of the ORPA is a suitable decomposition of the interatomic potential φ(r) into a reference

potential φ0(r) and a perturbation (the rest) φ1(r):

Although the original ORPA [1] was based on a speciﬁc choice of such a decomposition, in the following discus-
sion we temporarily leave unspeciﬁed the exact characterization of φ0(r). Equation (1) naturally leads to a similar
decomposition of the total and the direct correlation functions h(r) and c(r):

φ(r) = φ0(r) + φ1(r)

h(r) = h0(r) + ∆h(r)
c(r) = c0(r) + ∆c(r)

where h0(r) and c0(r) are the correlation functions of a reference ﬂuid whose particles interact via the potential
φ0(r). The thermodynamics and the correlation functions of the reference system are considered as known quantities.
∆h(r) and ∆c(r) are deﬁned by equations (2) and (3) and are the unknown functions of the theory. A relation among
them, for a ﬂuid whose number density is ρ, is provided by the Ornstein-Zernike equation

which, taking into account the fact that h0(r) and c0(r) do satisfy the same equation, results in the following

relation between the Fourier transforms of ∆h(r) and ∆c(r):

In formula (5), S0(q) = 1 + ρ ˆh0(q) is the structure factor of the reference system. A hat on a function of q indicates
the three-dimensional Fourier transforms of the corresponding function deﬁned in the r-space while ρ is the number
density of the system.

So far no approximation has been introduced yet. By complementing equation (5) with any approximate relation

between ∆h(r), ∆c(r) and φ1(r) we get a closed set of non-linear integral equations that has to be solved.

In particular, the ORPA closure corresponds to the dual relations:

h(r) = c(r) + ρ

∆h(r) = 0

for r < σ .

These equations impose, up to the ﬁnite crossover distance σ, the matching of the asymptotic long range behavior
of ∆c(r) (eq. (6)) and the condition that the approximation would not modify the pair correlation function at short
distances (eq. (7)). Due to the presence of relation (5) one could use as independent variable either the values of
∆h(r) at distances beyond σ or, more conveniently, the values of the function χ(r) = ∆c(r) for r < σ (χ(r) = 0 for
r > 0) .

It is easy to show that equation (7) corresponds to the extremum condition for the following functional [1,17] of

χ(r):

FRIN G[χ(r)] =

d3q{log[1 + S0(q)p(q)] − p(q)S0(q)}

(8)

1
2(2π)3ρ Z

where p(q) = ρ(β ˆφ1(q) − ˆχ(q)).
In a diagrammatic treatment, FRIN G would correspond to the sum of ring-like
diagrams and, as it is well known, for χ(r) = 0 corresponds to the random phase approximation which usually
violates the core condition (7). The ORPA enforces such a condition.

Indeed, by taking the functional derivative with respect to ∆ˆc(q) we have:

ρ
(2π)3 ∆ˆh(q)
and Fourier-transforming to the r-space we get for all the values of r:

δFRIN G
δ∆ˆc(q)

=

For 0 < r < σ, equation (10) becomes an integral equation for the unknown χ(r), diﬀerent from zero only in such

a region:

δFRIN G
δ∆c(r)

= ∆h(r).

δFRIN G
δχ(r)

= 0

for r < σ .

Thus, equation (11) is equivalent to imposing an extremum condition on FRIN G with respect to variations of
∆c(r) = χ(r) (inside σ).
If the reference potential is such that g0(r) inside σ is zero, we see that the extremum
condition is equivalent to the physical requirement that the size of the exclusion hole of the reference system is
preserved by the perturbation.

It is quite easy to verify that the solution of the equation (7), provided it exists, is actually unique and corresponds

to the maximum of the ORPA generating functional [14] (8).

To complete the description of the system, an explicit prescription for the reference system pair correlation function
g0(r) is required. In the usual approach to ORPA, the choice of g0(r) is treated as a separate step. Here we prefer
to deﬁne a “total” generating functional from which the full ORPA g(r) is derived. Actually we can introduce two
functionals having both FRIN G as generator of the “ORPA” contribution to the pair correlations and diﬀering in the
resulting g0.

For a homogeneous liquid interacting through a pair potential φ, the Helmoltz free energy per particle F can be

considered [18] a functional of φ(r) as well as a functional of the function e(r) = e−βφ(r). It is easy to show that

and that

where y(r) is the so-called cavity correlation function y(r) = g(r)eφ(r). We introduce two functionals — FGB[∆φ]
and FW CA[e] — as follows.

FGB[∆φ] =

By functional diﬀerentiation of FGB and FW CA with respect to φ(r) and e(r) respectively, we get

and

From the last equation we get immediately the g(r) resulting from FW CA as

g = g0 + ∆h(r)

y = y0 + eβφ1∆h(r).

g = g0e

−∆φ(r) + ∆h(r).

Thus, the functionals FGB and FW CA are such that the deviation from the reference system pair correlation function
is always given by the ORP A approximation ∆h(r) (eqn. 5), but the reference system pair correlation function is
g0 in one case and y0e−βφ1 in the other case. Due to the form of the reference system pair correlation functions
and the corresponding generating functionals, we refer to the former approximation as the Gibbs-Bogoliubov ORPA
(GB-ORPA) and to the latter as the Weeks-Chandler-Andersen ORPA (WCA-ORPA).

Notice that at this level the two functionals have been introduced just as generating functionals for the pair
correlation functions and we are not allowed yet to identify the values of the two functionals at the extremum with
the Helmoltz free energy.

III. ORPA FOR CONTINUOUS POTENTIALS

For a general value of the parameter σ, the solution χ(r) of equation (11) and the resulting ∆h(r) are discontinuous
at σ no matter if the reference system potential is continuous or not. While such a discontinuity looks relatively
harmless if the reference g0(r) has a hard core of diameter σ, a discontinuity in ∆h(r) at would be spurious in
connection with a continuous reference system.

For a similar problem, occurring in the case of the mean spherical approximation (MSA), a satisfactory solution
was found [15] by determining σ in such a way that the resulting correlation functions were continuous at σ. Here,
we can similarly impose the continuity of ∆c(r) (or equivalently ∆h(r)) at r = σ. Thus , we add the condition

∆h(σ+) = 0

as additional equation for σ.

Moreover, still in analogy with the MSA case, we can prove that the continuity condition at σ is equivalent to an

extremum condition of the ORPA functional (8) as a function of σ.

As shown in appendix A we have

∂FORP A/∂σ = 2πσ2∆χ2(σ

−

).

Thus, the continuity condition on the correlation functions implies that the GB-ORPA and WCA-ORPA functionals
have an extremum (inﬂection point) at σ. As we will discuss in the next section, this extremum condition is also the
clue for a thermodynamic consistent theory.

Here we just notice that there is a manyfold of solutions of equation (19). However a lower limit for σ is given by

the size of the excluded volume region of the reference system. That is, the region such that

(16)

(17)

(18)

(19)

(20)

(21)

A choice of σ smaller than the reference system exclusion hole would result again in an unphysical ORPA g(r). On
the other hand, since FW CA and FGB are increasing functions of σ (eqn. 20), the minimum value of will be achieved
for the ﬁrst value of σ larger than the reference system exclusion hole. Moreover, increasing σ, the size of the ORPA
correction to the reference system thermodynamics and correlations rapidly decreases.

IV. GENERATING FUNCTIONALS AND THERMODYNAMIC CONSISTENCE

Now we are in the position to discuss the thermodynamic interpretation of the functionals FGB and FW CA and

the speciﬁc issue of the thermodynamic consistency.

g(r) ≈ 0

It is well known that approximate integral equation theories for the correlation functions show quantitative violations
of fundamental thermodynamic equalities. In particular, here we are concerned with the equalities generated by the
identiﬁcation of the generating functional with the Helmoltz free energy per particle f . The most obvious of such
equalities is the equality between the pressure p obtained from the free energy per particle f ,

and that found through the virial theorem,

A necessary condition to ensure that a functional F [φ] is actually a free energy functional is the validity of equation

(12) (or (13)) [20].

Such a condition would be fulﬁlled by the functionals deﬁned in equations (14) and (15) if the dependence of such
functionals on all the parameters of the reference system, on σ (say ai) and on ∆χ vanishes. Then we have to satisfy
the following equations:

Eqn (26) corresponds to the ORPA formula [7] while eqn (24) is a way of determining the reference system param-
eters. Eqn. (25), as we have shown in the previous section is also related to the continuity of the resulting correlation
functions. Therefore, in order to have thermodynamic consistency we have to ensure that the functional would be
extremum with respect to variations of all the parameters. An analogous requirement for the choice of the reference
system in connection with the modiﬁed hypernetted chain approximation (MHNC) was derived by Lado et al. [10].
Even closer to the present problem is the analysis of the choice of the reference system within the WCA perturbation
theory provided by Lado [19].

Diﬀerent choices of the reference system parameters are certainly conceivable and actually this is the existing
situation. It is not easy to anticipate what is the best choice for all possible systems and a ﬁnal assessment should be
left to explicit numerical investigations. However, here we can notice that only the choices corresponding to extrema
of the generating functionals or choices completely independent of the thermodynamic state would ensure the free
energy nature of the generating functionals and then, as a consequence, the consistence of the energy and virial routes
to the equation of state.

V. CONCLUSIONS

In the present paper we have rephrased the ORPA in the language of the generating functionals for the pair

correlation function. In this way we could easily obtain three main results:

1) we can derive from a uniﬁed treatment the two prescription for the reference system g(r) ( equations (16) and

(18) ) present in the literature;

2) we can show how the ORPA can be extended to deal with continuous reference system interactions, potentially

increasing the range of applicability of this approximation;

3) we show that the closure equations, the removal of the discontinuity in the resulting pair correlations and the
identiﬁcation of the generating functionals with the Helmoltz free energy can be reduced to the unique and
unifying requirement of a variational principle on the functionals with respect to all the independent variables
and parameters.

5

The theory presented in this paper provides a general scheme corresponding to many possible choices for the
individual ingredients of the ORPA. Actually, depending on the reference system and on the ﬂavor of the ORPA (GB
or WCA), we have introduced diﬀerent possibilities. For this reason we postpone detailed numerical investigations to
the application of the approximation to speciﬁc problems.

Taking into account the already satisfactory level of accuracy of the standard implementations of the ORPA, and
judging from preliminar calculations, we can anticipate a good quality of the resulting numerical results. In particular
thermodynamical investigations could now beneﬁt from the clariﬁed status of thermodynamic consistency in the
ORPA. In this respect, we believe that the ORPA could play an important role as one of the best candidate for the
investigation of the ﬂuid phase diagrams.

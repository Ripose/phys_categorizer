Abstract

Diﬀerential cross sections for electron collisions with the O2 molecule in its ground X3Σ−g state, as well

as excited a1∆g and b1Σ+

g states are calculated. As previously, the ﬁxed-bond R-matrix method based on

state-averaged complete active space SCF orbitals is employed. In additions to elastic scattering of electron

g states, electron impact excitation from the X3Σ−g state to the a1∆g and

with the O2 X3Σ−g , a1∆g and b1Σ+
b1Σ+

g states as well as ’6 eV states’ of c1Σ−u , A′

u states is studied. Diﬀerential cross sections for
excitation to the ’6 eV states’ have not been calculated previously. Electron impact excitation to the b1Σ+
g
state from the metastable a1∆g state is also studied. For electron impact excitation from the O2 X3Σ−g state
to the b1Σ+

g state, our results agree better with the experimental measurements than previous theoretical

3∆u and A3Σ+

calculations. Our cross sections show angular behaviour similar to the experimental ones for transitions

from the X3Σ−g state to the ’6 eV states’, although the calculated cross sections are up to a factor two larger
at large scattering angles. For the excitation from the a1∆g state to the b1Σ+

g state, our results marginally

agree with the experimental data except for the forward scattering direction.

INTRODUCTION

A detailed knowledge of electron collisions with the oxygen molecule is important for the

physics and chemistry of both laboratory and astrophysical plasmas. In particular, recent attempts

to understand the electrical discharge oxygen-iodine laser have suggested that excited electronic

states of O2 molecule play an important role [1, 2]. In a previous paper [3] (henceforth denoted I),
we studied integral cross sections for electron collisions with the O2 molecule in its excited a1∆g
and b1Σ+
g states, in addition to the much studied electron scattering by the O2 X3Σ−g ground state.
We used the ﬁxed-bond R-matrix method with 13 target states represented by valence conﬁguration

interaction wave functions. State-averaged complete active space SCF (SA-CASSCF) orbitals

with Gaussian type basis functions were employed. The calculated cross sections for electron
impact excitation from the a1∆g state to the b1Σ+
g state at 4.5 eV agree well with the available
experimental data of Hall and Trajmar [4]. Although elastic scattering of electrons by the a1∆g
and b1Σ+

g states was also studied, we could not ﬁnd any experimental data for comparison.
In I, theoretical and experimental integral cross sections were compared. However, diﬀerential

cross sections (DCSs) provide a more stringent test of theory and are often easier to measure

reliably than integral cross sections. For electron impact electronic excitations, calculations which

give good integral cross sections often give DCS’s which diﬀer signiﬁcantly from those observed

experimentally. In this paper, we present DCSs for the corresponding processes calculated using

the same R-matrix model.

Previous experimental and theoretical studies in the ﬁeld of electron O2 collisions are well

summarized by Brunger and Buckman [5]. Here we only review works relevant to this paper. The

DCSs of electron collisions with O2 molecule have been measured by many experimental groups.
In particular, electron impact excitations to the low-lying a1∆g and b1Σ+

experimentally by Trajmar et al.

[6], Shyn and Sweeney [7], Allan [8], Middleton et al.

g states have been studied
[9],

and Linert et al. [10]. In contrast to these experimental works, only Middleton et al. [9] report

calculations of DCSs for these excitation processes. Some of the more recent measurements have

focused on electron impact excitations from the X3Σ−g ground state to the ‘6 eV states’, i.e., the
c1Σ−u , A′
u states which are also called the Herzberg pseudocontinuum [11, 12, 13].
Although these DCSs are not state-resolved in most case, Shyn and Sweeney [13] obtained cross

3∆u and A3Σ+

sections for excitation to the individual electronic state within the ‘6 eV states’. In this paper, we

also calculate the DCSs of this process using the ﬁxed-bond R-matrix method, since no previous

2

theoretical calculation exists. Up to now, there is only one measurement of DCSs for electron

collisions with electronically excited O2 molecule. Hall and Trajmar [4] obtained excitation cross
sections from the O2 a1∆g to the b1Σ+

g state at electron impact energy of 4.5 eV. Their integral cross

section was compared with our R-matrix results in I.

In this paper, details of the calculations are presented in section 2, and we discuss the results

in section 3 comparing our results with previous theoretical and available experiments. Then the

summary is given in section 4.

II. THEORETICAL METHODS

The R-matrix method itself has been described extensively in the literature [14, 15, 16] as well

as in I. Thus we do not repeat a general explanation of the method here. We used a modiﬁed version

of the polyatomic programs in the UK molecular R-matrix codes [14] to extract T-matrix elements

of the electron O2 scatterings. These programs utilize Gaussian type orbitals (GTO) to represent

target molecule as well as a scattering electron. Although most of the past R-matrix works on

electron O2 collisions have employed Slater type orbitals (STO), we select GTOs mainly because

of the simplicity of the input and availability of basis functions. The SA-CASSCF orbitals are

imported from the calculations with MOLPRO suites of programs [17]. The use of SA-CASSCF

orbitals improves the vertical excitation energies of the O2 target states compared to the energies

from HF orbitals as shown in I. These target orbitals are constructed from the the [5s,3p] con-

tracted basis of Dunning[18] augmented by a d function with exponent 1.8846, as in Sarpal et
3∆u,
al. [19]. In the R-matrix calculations, we included 13 target states; X3Σ−g ,a1∆g, b1Σ+
A3Σ+
u , 11Πg,13Πg,11Πu and 13Πu, where the last 4 Π states were not included
in the previous R-matrix studies performed by other groups. These target states were represented

u ,B3Σ−u ,11∆u, f ′

g ,c1Σ−u ,A′

1Σ+

by valence conﬁguration interaction wave functions constructed from the SA-CASSCF orbitals.

In our ﬁxed-bond R-matrix calculations, these target states are evaluated at the equilibrium bond

length R = 2.3 a0 of the O2 X3Σ−g ground electronic state.

The radius of the R-matrix sphere was chosen to be 10 a0 in our calculations. In order to rep-

resent the scattering electron, we included diﬀuse Gaussian functions up to l = 5 with 9 functions

for l = 0, 7 functions for l = 1 - 3 and 6 functions for l = 4 and 5. The exponents of these diﬀuse

Gaussian were ﬁtted using the GTOBAS program [20] in the UK R-matrix codes. Details of the

ﬁtting procedure are the same as in Faure et al. [20]. In addition to these continuum orbitals,

3

we included 8 extra virtual orbitals, one for each symmetry. The construction of the 17 electrons

CSFs for the total system is the same as in I. The R-matrix calculations were performed for all 8

irreducible representations of the D2h symmetry, Ag, B2u, B3u, B1g, B1u, B3g, B2g and Au, for both

doublet and quartet spin multiplicity of the electron plus target system.

The DCSs are evaluated from the T-matrix elements obtained by the R-matrix calculations. As

in Gianturco and Jain [21] and Malegat [22], the DCS is expanded using the Legendre polynomials,

, respectively.

In equation 2, the T-matrix elements belonging to diﬀerent total symmetries are multiplied to-

gether. Since these matrix elements come from diﬀerent calculations, overall phases of molecular

orbitals and target CI vectors underlying these matrix elements may be inconsistent (see [23]),

which may result in erroneous relative signs of these T-matrix elements. To avoid this inconsis-

tency, we saved reference target CI vectors from the ﬁrst calculation, Ag symmetry for example,

and then aligned the overall phases of the target CI vectors in other calculations, B2u, B3u, B1g, B1u,

B3g, B2g, Au symmetries, according to this reference. The same set of molecular orbitals was used

in all these calculations.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

A. Electron collisions with the O2 X3Σ−g ground state

Figure 1 shows DCSs for elastic electron scattering from the O2 X3Σ−g state compared with
previous theoretical and experimental results. Our results are very similar to the previous R-matrix

cross sections of W¨oste et al. [24]. The cross sections of Machado et al. [25] were calculated

using the Schwinger variational iterative method combined with the distorted-wave approximation.

Their results at 5 eV are much lower than the R-matrix results at low scattering angle below 50

degrees. Our results agree reasonably well with the experimental cross sections at 10 eV, including

the recent results of Linert et al. [26] for backward scattering. At 5 eV, our model signiﬁcantly

overestimates the cross sections for forward scattering compared to the experimental values. For

example, our result is twice as large as the experimental values at 10◦. This situation is the same in

the previous R-matrix calculation of W¨oste et al. [24]. As discussed by W¨oste et al., this deviation

can be attributed to a lack of long-range polarizability in the scattering model. For example,

Gillan et al. [27] introduced polarized pseudostates to account for the long-range polarizability

in electron-N2 scattering and reduced the cross sections by 50% in the threshold energy region.

The interaction potential of Machado et al. [25] includes the correlation-polarization term based

on free-electron-gas model. Probably the polarization introduced by this term is responsible for

their better agreement with experiment at 5 eV. Since we are interested in electron collisions with

the excited electronic states of O2 in this work, we chose not to pursue precise accuracy further

5

for the ground state elastic scattering. However, we have to be mindful that similar long-range

polarizability problems may exist in the other low-energy electron scattering processes, especially

elastic electron scattering of the a1∆g and b1Σ+

g state O2 molecules, which will be discussed below.
The DCSs for excitation to the a1∆g state at electron impact energy 5 and 10 eV are compared in

ﬁgure 2 with the previous theoretical calculation and the experimental measurements of Middleton

et al. [9], Shyn and Sweeney [7], Allan [8] and Linert et al. [10]. The cross sections at 5 eV agrees

well with the previous calculation and experimental data below 120◦. However, our results are

much lower than the previous calculation of Middleton et al. at scattering angle above 130◦. At an

electron scattering energy of 10 eV, our cross section deviates further from the previous calculation

of Middleton et al. [9] especially at scattering angle below 60◦ and above 140◦. In contrast to the

backward enhanced cross sections of Middleton et al., our DCSs have a slightly forward enhanced

character. Our results agree better with the experimental data at low scattering angles than the

previous calculation of Middleton et al. [9]. At large scattering angle, our results deviate from the

experimental data of Shyn and Sweeney [7], but agrees rather well with the recent measurement

of Linert et al. [10]. The R-matrix model of Middleton et al. [9] included the lowest 9 O2 target

states and l = 0 - 5 scattering electron orbitals with σ, π and δ symmetry. In this work, we included

13 target states and all components of l = 0 - 5 scattering electron orbitals. In addition to these

diﬀerences, Middleton et al. used HF/STO orbitals where we employed CASSCF/GTO orbitals.

We carried out a test calculation with l = 0 - 3 scattering electron orbitals and got almost the same

cross sections as in l = 0 - 5 case, which suggests that diﬀerence in the number of target states may

be important for the shape of these excitation cross sections.

Figure 3 compares DCSs for excitation to the b1Σ+

g state at electron impact energy of 5 and 10
eV with the previous R-matrix calculation and the experimental measurements of Middleton et al.

[9], Shyn and Sweeney [7] and Allan [8]. Transitions between Σ+ and Σ− target states are forbidden

at scattering angles of 0◦ and 180◦, because the scattered electron wave function vanishes in the

plane deﬁned by incident electron beam and the molecular axis for any orientation of the molecule

[28, 29]. As a consequence, the DCSs decrease to be zero toward 0 and 180◦. As is apparent

from ﬁgure 3, our cross sections become zero at 0 and 180◦, which is consistent with this selection

rule. Compared to the previous R-matrix calculations of Middleton et al. [9], our cross sections

have similar proﬁle, but with slightly smaller magnitude at all scattering angles. Agreement with

experiment is good at 5 eV below 120◦, although our results underestimate the experimental cross

sections at larger scattering angles. At 10 eV, the magnitude of the experimental cross sections of

6

Middleton et al. [9] and Shyn and Sweeney [7] do not agree with each other, however our cross

sections are closer to the results of Shyn and Sweeney at low scattering angles below 50◦. Between

60◦ and 90◦, our results are closer to the results of Middleton et al.

Figure 4 shows DCSs for excitations to the ’6 eV states’ for electron impact energies of 10 and

15 eV. Here the ’6 eV states’ means the group of the O2 c1Σ−u , A′
u states. The cross
sections shown in ﬁgure 4 are a sum of individual excitation cross sections of these 3 electronic

3∆u and A3Σ+

states, in line with most experimental measurements. The ﬁgure includes the recent experimental

cross sections of Campbell et al. [11], Green et al. [12] and Shyn and Sweeney [13]. The individual

cross sections are shown in ﬁgure 5 and 6 for impact energies of 10 and 15 eV, together with the

state-resolved experimental cross sections of Shyn and Sweeney [13]. Our summed cross sections

given in ﬁgure 4 are backward-enhanced for both the 10 and 15 eV cases, in accordance with

the experimental cross sections Campbell et al. [11] and Shyn and Sweeney [13]. However, the

forward enhancement of the DCSs at 10 eV observed by Green et al. [12] is not reproduced by

our calculation. The individual cross sections in ﬁgure 5 and 6 show similar angular behaviour

compared to the experimental results of Shyn and Sweeney. However our DCSs for excitation to

3∆u state is more steep toward backward direction. Also the peak in the A3Σ+

the A′
sections is more pronounced in our calculation. Note that our results for the A3Σ+

u state cross
u state become

zero at 0 and 180◦ as dictated by the Σ−

Σ+ selection rule.

B. Electron collisions with the O2 a1∆g and b1Σ+

g excited states

The DCSs for elastic electron scattering with the excited O2 a1∆g and b1Σ+

g states are shown in
ﬁgure 7. We cannot compare them with previous theoretical or experimental work, since there is

no available data. These DCSs show strong similarity with those of the elastic electron scattering

with the X3Σ−g ground state in ﬁgure 1. The magnitude of these cross sections is almost the same
for the 10 eV case. All of them have a large forward peak at 0◦, a small rise in the cross sections

at 180◦. The location of the minimum moves inward from 140◦ to 90◦ as the electron scattering

energy increases. This similarity is also reﬂected in the integral cross sections for elastic electron
collisions with the X3Σ−g , a1∆g and b1Σ+
g states. The proﬁles and magnitudes of the integral cross
sections are basically the same for all these 3 electronic states as shown in I. The main conﬁgu-

ration of these 3 electronic states has the form (core) π4

u, and this may be responsible for this
similarity. Our R-matrix calculations tend to overestimate the elastic scattering cross sections of

gπ2

7

the X3Σ−g state at low scattering angles, below 50◦, compared to the experimental data. Consider-
ing the strong similarity of the cross section proﬁles for elastic scattering from excited states and

the ground state, our calculations may also overestimate the cross section at low scattering angle

at low electron impact energy.

In table I, we show momentum transfer cross sections for electron elastic scattering by the

X3Σ−g , a1∆g and b1Σ+
g states. As a consequence of the similarity in DCSs, the momentum transfer
cross sections have a similar magnitude. Compared to the experimental data of Shyn and Sharp

[30] and Sullivan et al. [31], our calculation overestimates the X3Σ−g state momentum transfer
cross section at 2 eV by 20 %, but underestimates the cross section at 10 eV by 8 % of Sullivan

et al.’s value or 29 % of Shyn and Sharp’s value. Our momentum transfer cross sections for the

g states may similarly be overestimates or underestimates depending on the electron

a1∆g and b1Σ+

impact energy.

Figure 8 shows DCSs for electron impact excitation from the a1∆g state to the b1Σ+

g state. The
ﬁgure also includes the experimental data of Hall and Trajmar [4] at impact energy of 4.5 eV.

Our cross section proﬁles have characteristic features of minima around 10◦ and 90◦ and maxima

around 50◦ and 150◦. They agree with the experimental cross sections of Hall and Trajmar [4]

within their error bars except at 20◦ and 30◦. The cross sections of Hall and Trajmar appear to

increase from 50◦ to 0◦ whereas our cross sections decrease from 60◦ toward 10◦. In the 50◦ –

140◦ angular region, Hall and Trajmar’s cross sections vary less than ours. However, a precise

comparison is diﬃcult because of large error bars and lack of other experimental data.

IV. SUMMARY

We have calculated diﬀerential cross sections for electron collisions with O2 molecule in its

ground X3Σ−g state, as well as excited a1∆g and b1Σ+
g states. As in our previous work, we employed
the ﬁxed-bond R-matrix method based on state-averaged complete active space SCF orbitals. In
additions to elastic scattering of electron with the O2 X3Σ−g , a1∆g and b1Σ+
g states, we studied
electron impact excitations from the X3Σ−g state to the a1∆g and b1Σ+
g states as well as ’6 eV states’
of c1Σ−u , A′
u states. DCSs for the excitations to the ’6 eV states’ were not calculated
previously. We also studied electron impact excitation to the b1Σ+
g state from the metastable a1∆g
state. For electron impact excitation from the O2 X3Σ−g state to the b1Σ+
g state, our results agree
better with the experimental measurements than the previous theoretical cross sections. Our cross

3∆u and A3Σ+

8

sections show similar angular behaviour the to experimental ones for transitions from the X3Σ−g
state to the ’6 eV states’. For the excitation from the a1∆g state to the b1Σ+
g state, our results

marginally agree with experimental data except for the forward scattering direction.

APPENDIX: DERIVATION OF EQUATION 2.

Derivation of the DCS formula in equation 2 is similar to that of Malegat [22] except for the

use of real spherical harmonics S m

codes instead of complex form Y m

l employed in the polyatomic version of UK molecular R-matrix
l . For convenience of reader, brief derivation of the formula is

given in this appendix. In the expressions below, we follow the notation of Malegat [22].

The scattering wave function describing collision of an electron plane wave with a molecule is

expressed as,

Here x denotes the space and spin coordinates of the molecular electrons. The primed coordinates

refer to the molecular frame with z′-axis along the molecular symmetry axis, and the unprimed

coordinates to the laboratory frame with the z-axis along the incident electron beam. The incident

electron has wavenumber ki with spin projection msi. The index i represents quantum numbers of
the electronic state of the target molecule, Γi, S i and MS i, whereas the index I refers to (i, msi)

In order to expand the wave function in equation A.1, a symmetry adapted N+1-electron wave

The comparison of diﬀerent models (the Ore, spur and blob models) of
positronium (Ps) formation is presented. Because in molecular media Ps is
formed in the terminal positron blob and not in an ordinary spur, the application
of the blob model seems to be the most adequate. We extend this model for
consideration of the Ps formation in the presence of external electric ﬁeld (< 100
kV/cm). In the simpliﬁed limiting case, this approach provides a formula similar
to the Onsager one for the geminate recombination probability. The inﬂuence
of ion-electron recombination and other intrablob processes on Ps formation is
taken into account. The role of quasifree positronium in Ps formation process
is discussed.

I. INTRODUCTION

Interpretation of the data obtained by means of diﬀerent methods of the positron annihi-
lation spectroscopy (PAS) is largely based on theoretical understanding of primary physico-
chemical reactions and processes in the terminal part of the positron track, and on comprehen-
sion of the nature of the states from which the positrons may annihilate.1,2

Because of extreme rapidity of the primary radiation chemical processes, fundamental knowl-
edge about them is obtained mainly from theoretical analysis and interpretation of relevant ex-
perimental data and ﬁrst of all from pulse radiolysis, permitting to enter the area of pico- and
(probably, in the near future) femtosecond time scale.3 PAS and especially the experiments in
external electric ﬁelds allow one to obtain important supplementary information about the intra-
track processes, namely ion-electron recombination, e+ and e− thermalization and localization,
positronium (Ps) formation, inﬂuence of various chemical additives and to make conclusions
about the spatial structure of the e+ track.4 These advances throughout the last two decades
became possible due to essential instrumental achievements (application of low-energy positron
beams, better time resolution, accumulation of higher statistics) and theoretical development
(calculations of cross sections and rate constants of a variety of fundamental processes with
participation of positrons, investigations of e+-e−-correlations, slowing down, track eﬀects).
This progress signiﬁcantly increased the reliability of PAS.

First experiments on Ps formation (including those in external electric ﬁeld) were carried
out in low-density simple atomic gases, where Ps is formed predominantly according to the Ore
mechanism.5,6 It implies that the ”hot” positron, e+∗, pulls out an electron from a molecule M,
forming Ps atom and leaving behind the radical-cation M+·:

→
This process is the most eﬀective, when the energy W of the positron lays within the interval
named the Ore gap:

e+∗ + M

Ps + M+·.

IG −

Ry/2 < W < Wex.

Here IG is the ﬁrst ionization potential of the molecule, Wex is its electronic excitation threshold
and Ry/2 = 6.8 eV is the Ps binding energy in vacuum. It is believed, that the positron with
Ry/2 cannot pick up an electron from a molecule. When W > Wex
the energy lower than IG −
electronic excitations and ionizations compete with Ps formation and the last one becomes less
eﬀective.

Theoretical consideration of the electric ﬁeld eﬀect on Ps formation in gases was based on
a solution of the Boltzmann kinetic equation.5 This approach successfully explained the rather
sharp growth of the Ps yield vs the ﬁeld in rare gases, molecular hydrogen (H2, D2) and N2
at moderate densities.6 Electric ﬁeld hinders energy loss by the positrons and at the same
time ”heats” them up to the energies above the lower boundary of the Ore gap. The simple
estimation of the ﬁeld E needed to keep e+ within the Ore gap can be obtained if we equate a
gain of the e+ kinetic energy between two subsequent collisions

iv is carried out over orientations of
the velocity v of the positron. From such a balance condition one obtains that the average
e+ kinetic energy
iv is approximately equal to (M/m)1/2eEltr. At typical gas densities and
external ﬁelds 10-500 V/cm it falls in the eV region. Thus, rather moderate electric ﬁelds are
able to accelerate positrons up to the energies needed for realization of reaction (1). It is worth
mentioning that in liquid helium the ﬁeld dependence of the Ps formation probability, PPs, is
qualitatively the same as in the gas phase.7 It means that the Ore process contributes to the
Ps formation in liquid helium. Respective growth of the PPs occurs in ﬁelds, approximately
500 times larger than in the gas phase, which is in accordance with the above estimation. This
increase of the threshold ﬁeld is determined by the decrease of ltr, which is inversely proportional
to the density of helium.

More detailed theoretical considerations of Ps formation problem in light noble gases require
a knowledge of energy dependencies of momentum transfer, σm, and annihilation, σa, cross sec-
tions of e+ vs its kinetic energy (see Ref.8 and references therein). In terms of energy dependent
cross sections the theory succeeded to explain the most striking experimental observation in
gases: so-called ”shoulder” in the e+ lifetime annihilation spectra.9 It appears due to existence
of the Ramsauer minimum in σm(W ) which usually takes place at W

1 eV.

In the 1990’s, the Ps formation in noble gases was studied over a wide range of densities in
the presence of static electric ﬁeld.10,11 One of the motivations for these studies was a signiﬁcant
contradiction between available experimental values of PPs in heavier noble gases (Kr, Xe) and
corresponding predictions of the standard Ore model. Another unanswered question was why
the application of a strong electric ﬁeld does not increase PPs up to unity? Probably the origin
of the eﬀects (as well as a surprising decrease of PPs at higher ﬁelds in Xe) is related to the
formation of localized states (due to the self-trapping) by both e+ and Ps prior to annihilation.12
In molecular gases (H2, N2, CO2, CH4) with low-lying vibrational or rotational levels, Ps
yield reveals complex behavior with changes in the density, temperature and electric ﬁeld.9
It cannot be convincingly treated in terms of e+-M and Ps-M cross sections. However exper-
imental data can be ﬁtted by means of combination of the Ore process and recombination
mechanism. The last one suggests Ps formation in condensed media through combination of
the thermalized positron with one of track electrons produced by e+ ionization of the medium
in the terminal part of the e+ track.13–15 Later on, the Onsager-like formulation of the re-
combination mechanism (the spur model13) became very widespread in spite of ignorance of
the presence of positive molecular ions and other intrablob electrons, diﬀerent mobilities of e+
and e− (Sec.
II). Anyhow, combination of the Ore model and the spur model satisfactorily
reproduces experimentally observed variations of PPs vs density and electric ﬁeld.16–18

Since the mid-1970’s the Ps formation at low ﬁelds (< 200 kV/cm) was also investigated
in liquid and solid paraﬃns19,20 and some pure liquids.21–23 Below several tens of kV/cm the
Ps yield noticeably drops, then the falling decelerates and a tendency to reach a plateau is
observed. Application of much stronger ﬁelds (
1 MV/cm) may push the positron in the Ore
∼
gap and keep it there until the Ps will be formed, or e+ annihilate with one of the molecular
electrons. Thereby the strong electric ﬁeld stimulates reaction (1). It is very probable that this
phenomenon was experimentally observed in solid (polar and nonpolar) polymers24, though
the other factors (formation of bulk and surface charges, ﬁeld induced electron and positron
trapping/detrapping on structural defects) were mentioned, which may also increase the Ps
yield in the ﬁelds about 1 MV/cm.25

A theoretical interpretation of these experiments in condensed phase was attempted by
Brandt et al.26,27 basing on the theory of Teutsch and Hughes5 developed originally for gases.
The theory successfully describes the growth of Ps yield in strong ﬁelds because of the ”heating”

2

of the positron and keeping it in the Ore gap. Characteristic ﬁeld strength E∗ (when the Ps yield
begins to grow up) may be estimated from the condition LET = eE∗, where LET (the linear
energy transfer of e+,
dW/dx) is determined by excitations of molecular vibrations (typical
value is about 10−2 eV/˚A). Thus we ﬁnd that the corresponding ﬁeld is E∗

1 MV/cm.

−

In small ﬁelds the situation seems to be diﬀerent. According to the Brandt theory, the
decrement of the Ps yield is explained by the inﬂuence of the ﬁeld on the positron escaping
from the Ore gap during its thermalization. This process is considered as e+ random walks in
(eEl)2/(l/v). It is expected
energy space with the ﬁeld dependent diﬀusion coeﬃcient Dp(E)
that, when the ﬁeld is applied, the positrons should abandon the Ore gap faster and therefore
Ps formation must decrease. However, it is unclear why the authors considered only positron
diﬀusion out of the Ore gap but did not include their diﬀusion back to this energy region.
This theory completely ignores the track eﬀects on Ps formation.
It is unable to interpret
the suppression of the Ps yield to almost zero when a quasifree electron scavenger is added
to the medium. These eﬀects are beyond the Ore model and the theory26,27. Moreover, it
predicts too large thermalization lengths for e+ and e−, 100 times higher than ones known in
radiation chemistry.28 As we shall see in the next sections these eﬀects in low ﬁelds get a natural
explanation within the framework of the recombination mechanism of the Ps formation.

∼

∼

In the present paper we have developed new approach for consideration of the electric ﬁeld
eﬀect on Ps formation at low electric ﬁelds (. 100 kV/cm), where it is possible to neglect
positron acceleration by the ﬁeld up to the eV energies. This approach is based on the recom-
bination mechanism (diﬀusion-recombination model or blob model),29–31 and properly takes
into account the multipair nature of the end part of the positron track.

In Section II Ps formation in condensed molecular media is considered. We introduce a
concept of the quasifree positronium (a weakly bound e+-e−-pair, a precursor of the Ps in
a bubble). We also present the arguments in favor of that the Ore process plays negligible
role at low electric ﬁelds, where an adequate description of Ps formation may be achieved in
the framework of the recombination mechanism. Finally the diﬀerence between spur and blob
models is discussed. In Section III an approximate mathematical formulation of the problem
is given. General expression for the Ps formation probability is obtained and some particular
cases are considered. The last section contains some discussions of the results and further
extension of this model.

II. POSITRONIUM FORMATION IN CONDENSED MEDIA

A. Quasifree Ps state. Modiﬁcation of the Ore gap

Consideration of the Ps formation in condensed molecular media (dielectric liquids, poly-
mers, some molecular crystals) requires clariﬁcation of all intermediate stages and states, pre-
ceding the formation of the ﬁnal equilibrium state of the Ps atom. It is well known that in
liquids the repulsive interaction resulting from the exchange of the electrons between Ps and
surrounding molecules eventually leads to the formation of an equilibrium bubble with the
radius about some angstroms.32 However, as we shall see below, formation of the quasifree Ps
(qf-Ps) precedes the formation of the Ps bubble. The qf-Ps state corresponds to the bottom
of the lower energy band available to the interacting e+-e− pair before any rearrangement of
molecules takes place. The notion of the qf-Ps was invoked in the frameworks of the recombi-
nation mechanism of the Ps formation in order to explain the E-ﬁeld eﬀect on Ps formation in
hydrocarbons31 and in relation to the Ps bubble model.

An availability of a large free space in gases always allows neglecting the zero-point kinetic
energy of Ps, caused by the presence of the gas molecules. So in this case Ps binding energy
Ry/2. In condensed phase the presence of molecules, ﬁrstly, essentially increases
is simply
Ps zero-point kinetic energy arising owing to Ps repulsion from them (both e− and e+ are
repelled from the cores of atoms because of exchange and Coulombic repulsions, respectively).
Sometimes it is called as a ”conﬁnement” of the Ps. Secondly, molecular electrons screen
the e+-e− Coulombic attraction and increase average e+-e− separation in the positronium.
Obviously these factors decrease binding energy between the positron and electron constituing
the positronium and therefore reduce the width of the Ore gap, which may even completely
disappear.

For the ﬁrst time the conﬁnement of the Ps was studied by Brandt33 on the base of the
solution found by Sommerfeld and Welker34,35 of the quantum-mechanical problem of a hydro-
gen atom conﬁned by an impenetrable sphere of the radius R. Strict analytical solution of the
same problem for the Ps atom is not available because of the impossibility of formulating the
problem in terms of the center-of-mass coordinate and relative coordinate when the external
potential is present.

Elementary estimation of the Ps conﬁnement eﬀect is the following. Ground state energy of a
point particle with the mass 2m in an inﬁnite potential well of the radius R is π2~2
2
,
where aB = 0.53 ˚A is the Bohr radius. For R = πaB ≈
1.66 ˚A this energy becomes equal to
Ry/2, of the free Ps atom taken with an opposite sign (for H atom it
the binding energy,
happens at R = 1.835aB = 0.97 ˚A). This gives a hint, that Ps might become unstable with
respect to a break up on e+ and e− and indicates that in a dense medium the width of the Ore
gap becomes narrower and even may disappear.

Certainly such an approach simulating Ps repulsion from molecules by an inﬁnitely deep
potential wall is crude. A more realistic evaluation of the energy of qf-Ps in a liquid phase can
be obtained basing on the modiﬁed Ps bubble model,36,37 particularly using the values of the
depth U of potential wells of equilibrium Ps bubbles (U does not depend on the radius of the
Ps bubble).

The matter is that the physical meaning of U coincides with that of the Ps work function
V Ps
(the energy needed for Ps to enter the liquid without any rearrangement of molecules and
0
stay there in the quasifree state). With the free-volume radius of the bubble tending to zero, the
positronium transfers from the bubble just to the qf-Ps state, which has no preferential location
in a bulk. Note, that V Ps

is at the same time the ground state energy of
the e−

to inﬁnity is deﬁned to be zero.38 Ps work function V Ps

energy, V Ps

liquids of various chemical nature values of V Ps

that Eb ≈ −
(0.5 to 1) eV. It means that qf-Ps is a loosely bound structure although the
long-range Coulombic attraction between e+ and e− always provides an existence of the bound
state (at least within the Onsager radius). Because positron-electron separation, rep, in qf-Ps
is expected to be large we may rewrite Eb in the following form:

directly follows from the Schr¨odinger equation for Ps and is conﬁrmed experimentally.39 Using
above mentioned numerical assessment for Eb and Eq.(4b) we conclude that rep is about 5 ˚A.
In such a Ps state delocalized over rep the density of the ”native” electron on the positron is
rather small and e+ will primarily annihilate with electrons of the medium with the average
lifetime about 0.5 ns and contribute to the free e+ component of the ACAR spectrum. Thus, qf-
Ps component could hardly be resolved experimentally, but it should renormalize contribution
ascribed to the ”free” e+ annihilation. If the standard three exponential decomposition of the
LT spectra is used the presence of qf-Ps is revealed, for example, in anomalous behavior of free
e+ lifetime.40

Further evidence that qf-Ps is a delocalized object is provided by rather high values of
V Ps
0 . Firstly, if we accept for the moment that qf-Ps in liquid may be considered as a ”point”

particle, in that case V Ps
should represent just its zero-point kinetic energy due to the repulsion
from surrounding molecules. Secondly, it is quite reasonable to assume that an excess quasifree
electron injected into the liquid undergoes the same exchange repulsion as the ”point”-qf-Ps.
Therefore, it immediately implies that zero-point kinetic energy, K, of the e−
qf should be twice
as large as that of positronium and equal to 2V Ps
5-7 eV. It is simply because the electron
is half as heavy as Ps. However, it is very diﬃcult to conceive that the negative polarization
term and yield known experimental values of V −
contribution, P−, could compensate 2V Ps
0 ,
which are usually close to zero or even slightly negative.

Finally we are able to estimate the low boundary Wlow of the Ore gap in condensed phase.
Because the Ore process is just an electron transfer reaction, we assume that no rearrangement
of molecules occurs and, therefore, ﬁnal positronium will be in the quasifree state (formation
of the bubble requires much longer time).
If translational kinetic energy of the ﬁnal qf-Ps
0), the excess kinetic energy, W , of the projectile positron in this case should
is thermal (
coincide with the low boundary the Ore gap: W = Wlow. Now, let us carry out the Born-Haber
cycle again, i.e. virtually pull out reagents to the gas phase, accomplish Ps formation reaction
(1) and return products to the liquid:

short (less and probably much less than 0.1 ps). That is why, generally speaking, Ps formation
according to the Ore mechanism is ineﬀective in molecular media. However, it appears to be
important when high external electric ﬁelds are applied.

B. Recombination mechanism of Ps formation. Spur and blob models

Recombination mechanism postulates that Ps formation proceeds via combination of the
positron and one of the knocked out electrons in the terminal part of the positron track. There
are two models, which utilize this mechanism, namely, the spur model1,13 and the blob model
(or diﬀusion-recombination model)2,14,15,29. According to these models the decrease of the Ps
yield in low ﬁelds (up to 100 kV/cm) occurs because the ﬁeld takes apart the positron and
track electrons in diﬀerent directions. Therefore, probability of their encounter, as well as the
Ps yield, drop down. In spite of the fact that both models answer the question about the Ps
precursor in the same way, they diﬀer in the point what is the terminal part of the e+ track
and how to calculate the probability of the Ps formation. Quantitative formulation of the spur
model was given by Tao.42 It is based on the following assumptions:

1) the positron and secondary electrons knocked out during of the last several acts of
ionizations thermalize within the same volume of the medium. Positive ions also reside in the
same space;

2) secondary electrons recombine with the same probability either with the positive ion or
the positron. Therefore, the probability that the positron gets an electron for subsequent Ps
formation is equal to n0/(1 + n0), where n0 is the ”initial” number of ion-electron pairs in the
terminal spur;

3) probability of the ”elementary act” of e+-e− recombination is taken in the Onsager form,
e−rc/b, where rc = e2/εT is the Onsager radius, T is the temperature in energy units, b is the
1
−
”initial” distance between e+ and e− by the end of their thermalization, and ε is the dielectric
permittivity of the medium.

Thus, in the frameworks of the spur model Ps formation probability is written as:

in accordance with Eq.(6) that the terminal positron spur contains in average 2-3 ion-electron
pairs.

Later on, the recombination mechanism of Ps formation became extremely widespread. It
is able to interpret extensive data on Ps chemistry (see1 and ref. therein). In contrast to the
Ore model, this mechanism easily explains variation of the Ps yields from 0 up to 0.7 in the
substances of various chemical nature, where the Ore gap is practically the same. Changes of
the Ps formation probability under phase transitions also received natural explanation. Exper-
imentally observable monotonic decrement of the inhibition curves of the Ps yields (practically
down to zero) in solutions of electron acceptors contradicts the Ore model, but is well incorpo-
rated to the recombination mechanism. It naturally explains antiinhibition and antirecombi-
nation eﬀects, including experiments on formation Ps in low electric ﬁelds in pure liquids and
mixtures.23,44,4

In45 the spur model was used as the basis for computer simulation of the Ps formation
process. Terminal part of the e+ track was approximated by a linear sequence of separated

7

ion-electron pairs. Fitting of the data in 2,2-dimethylbutane, it was obtained that the average
distance between ﬁnal acts of ionizations at the end of the e+ track is about 165 ˚A, which
seemingly agrees with the spur model. Nevertheless, having considered the data for more
than 50 liquids, the authors45 came to the conclusion that multiparticle eﬀects in the terminal
positron spur are rather important for correct description of the processes in it.

However, inconsistencies of the spur model should be mentioned (and the conclusions of the
above simulations, in particular) with the data on the structure of the positron track (Fig.2).
The matter is that the end of the positron track is not a spur, containing 2-3 ion-electron
pairs, but the blob, containing about 30 overlapped ion-electron pairs.30,46–48 In essence this
statement relies on the following two well known facts related to behavior of the energized
electron (positron) on the blob formation stage, i.e. at energies Ry . W . 500 eV (Appendix
A):

1) Ionization energy losses of such a positron (electron) is about 1-4 eV/˚A. It means, that
e+ very eﬀectively ionizes molecules at the end of its track. Because the average energy Wiep,
needed for creation of one ion-electron pair is2 1/Giep ≈
16-22 eV, (Giep is the initial yield
of ion-electron pairs per 100 eV of the absorbed energy) the distance li between subsequent

2) Motion of the positron in the blob is diﬀusion-like (its transport path at these energies
varies from 20 down to several ˚A, Fig.3). Thus, eﬃcient e+ scattering at the blob formation
stage results in approximately spherical shape of the blob. Therefore, the simulation of the
end part of the e+ track by the straight-line sequence of isolated ion-electron pairs45 or by a
cylindrical column of ionizations48 seem to be unjustiﬁed.

The statement that the terminal part of the e+ track is a blob, but not a spur is not just a
question of terminology. As we shall see below, some primary processes, including Ps formation,
proceed in a diﬀerent way in blobs and spurs.31 Another important distinction is that in the blob
model behavior of the positron is considered as very diﬀerent from that of intrablob electrons
and ions. Usually in the blob approach it is assumed that e+ is rather mobile and easily escapes
from its blob (Sec.II E). Particularly, it implies that the multiparticle nature of the terminal
part of the e+ track cannot be correctly taken into account via the factor n0/(n0 + 1). In details
we shall discuss these diﬀerences below, but now we shall brieﬂy remind the life history of the
positron, starting from its birth up to the annihilation.

C. Life history of the positron

Even though the positron is a stable elementary particle, its lifetime in matter turns out to
be very short owing to presence its antiparticles – electrons. Usually the positrons are born in
nuclear β+-decay (of 22Na or 64Cu) with typical initial energy about several hundreds of keV.
After implantation into a medium their life may be divided into three stages. It is convenient to
subdivide the ﬁrst stage into two steps: a) slowing down by ionization and b) thermalization.
Retardation from the initial energy down to the ionization threshold lasts about 10−11 s. When
e+ energy becomes less than Wbl ∼
500 eV, the positron forms its terminal blob (Appendix A).
In the second step, the subionizing positron and knocked-out electrons become thermalized,
exciting primarily intra- and intermolecular vibrations. In molecular liquids, it usually takes
less than 10−13 s in addition to the duration of the ﬁrst step.

The second stage involves fast intrablob reactions with the participation of primary radical-
cations RH+· (ions) and thermalized electrons and positrons. According to the recombination

8

mechanism, Ps is formed just at this stage. This stage is limited by localization (solvation),
ion-electron recombination, or out-diﬀusion of the species. The typical duration of this stage
is 10−12-10−11 s.

The third stage includes diﬀerent chemical reactions between Ps, localized species, and

pick-oﬀ process. This ﬁnal stage lasts about 10−10-10−9 s.

D. Main distinctions between spurs and blobs

1. Sizes and energy release

In radiation chemistry the term ”spur” denotes the small isolated spherical part of the track
of an ionizing particle, containing a few (nsp
0 = 1-5) ion-electron pairs.46,49 Average energy
release in the spur is 30-50 eV. Its typical size is determined by a thermalization length of the
knocked out electron in the Coulombic ﬁeld of the ion. In a crude description of radiation-
chemical processes it is possible to assume, that tracks of high energy electrons and Compton
electrons produced by 60Co γ-rays consist only of isolated spurs (contribution of short tracks
and blobs is rather small). In spurs with a few ion-electron pairs, Onsager’s description of the
geminate recombination is plausible.50

As we already mentioned, the end part of the e+ track is a blob. Calculations show (Ap-
pendix A) that the spatial distribution of ionization events in it can be simulated by gaussian
function n0
30 is the initial number of ion-electron pairs and
40 ˚A. The blob size abl is determined by the ionization slowing down of the energetic
abl ≈
positron, when it loses energy from Wbl ∼
500 eV (total energy deposition in the blob) down
to the ionization threshold.

2. Quasi-neutrality condition

In blobs knocked out electrons before getting localized rapidly adjust their motion to the
distribution of the primary positive ions and eﬃciently screen them51. Such a quasi-neutrality
electron distribution in the ﬁeld of ions is established because 1) Coulombic interaction between
ions and electrons is strong enough (the Onsager radius is much larger than the blob size and
average electron thermalization displacement43) 2) mobility of electrons is much higher than
that of ions. Simple estimations (Appendix B) show that the width of the spatial distribution of
bl/rcn0 ≪
the intrablob electrons is only a few angstroms larger than that of ions: ae −
e and a2
abl. Hence abl ≈
i are dispersions of the distributions of the electrons
and ions, respectively. The concept of quasi-neutrality of the blob seems reasonable especially
in non-polar liquids where an absence of signiﬁcant spatial ﬂuctuations of local electric ﬁeld (in
contrast to polar media) favors establishing blob quasi-neutrality and complete recombination
of charges.

ai. Here a2

ae ≈

ai ≈

2.4a2

Because of the Coulombic attraction between charged intrablob species their diﬀusion expan-
sion does not proceed independently. As a result out-diﬀusion of electrons is almost completely
suppressed, but the diﬀusion coeﬃcient of ions is increased by a factor of 2. This case is known

3. Expansion of the blob

9

as ambipolar diﬀusion (Appendix C). Thus blob expansion proceeds very slowly and may be
practically neglected in the problem of Ps formation.

4. Elongated thermalization and recombination

After the last ionization event in the terminal blob, the positron and intrablob electrons
become subionizing. Having no possibility to excite electronic transitions in molecules, they
lose energy by exciting molecular vibrations.
In polar media there is an additional way of
energy losses: reorientation of the dipole molecules (Debye losses). Thermalization theories
usually consider molecular excitation a result of its perturbation by an alternating electric ﬁeld
induced by a ﬂight of an isolated charged particle.52,41 If the Fourier spectrum of this ﬁeld
contains harmonics with frequencies close to those of molecular vibrations, excitations get very
probable.
In the blob because of the presence of a large number of ion-electron pairs and
eﬃcient screening (local quasi-neutrality), the resulting electric ﬁeld at a given point does not
ﬂuctuate signiﬁcantly. Thus, in spite of fast motion of intrablob electrons, they cannot lose
kinetic energy easily via excitation of vibrations. This lengthens thermalization of electrons and
ion-electron recombination because these processes depend on the absorption rate of released
energy.

E. Behavior of the positron and positronium formation

1. e+ escape from the blob

Because the blob is electrically neutral, Coulombic interaction between the positron and
its blob is absent. Polarization attraction between e+ and the blob is small enough (Sec.V
F). Therefore, after the last ionization even subionizing positron may easily to escape from its
blob during thermalization by travelling a longer distance than the blob electrons, which are
held by the ions. So one may expect that the width of the e+ spatial distribution by the end
of thermalization is larger than the blob size: ap > abl. Strictly speaking a2
p is a dispersion
of initial (gaussian) distribution of the thermalized positron around the center of the blob.
Because e+ thermalizes primarily outside the blob its thermalization time is not aﬀected by the
above mentioned elongation of the thermalization process.

2. e+ mobility

In non-polar liquids the positron after its thermalization is expected to be in the quasifree
state having rather high mobility in comparison with than that of the quasifree electron (Table
I). Firstly, it is due to the absence signiﬁcant spatial ﬂuctuations of local electric ﬁeld, which
may trap or localize the positron (the medium is nonpolar). Secondly, a density of a liquid
state is too high to permit clasterization of molecules around the positron like in pressurized
gases.12

Actually because of the screening, Coulombic interaction with nuclei plays minor role in
the scattering of the quasifree positron and electron. Their mobilities are primarily determined
by the small angular scattering on outer molecular electrons (see, for example, Eq.12 in ref.30).
However, for excess electrons there is some spin-exchange contribution which enhances e− scat-
tering and decreases their mobility in comparison of the e+
qf one. Exchange repulsion may even

10

lead to full localization of the excess electron in a void. Contrary, the positron prefers to reside
in a bulk because of polarization interaction. Preferential e+ traps are positive density ﬂuctua-
tions (aggregation of molecules).12 However, such traps practically cannot be formed in a liquid
phase because of strong asymmetry of intermolecular interaction potential.

3. ”Elementary act” of Ps formation

Being thermalized primarily outside its terminal blob, quasifree positron may diﬀuse to
the blob again and pick up one of the intrablob electrons. That process needs the ”initial”
separation between the particles not exceeding the average distance between intrablob species,
e− pair is
i.e. (4πa3
about 0.1 eV. Translational kinetic energies of each particle composing the pair must be less
than the initial binding energy, otherwise the pair will break up. Therefore e+ and e− just
before the ”elementary act” of Ps formation must be practically thermalized.

In the framework of the adiabatic approximation (the positions of molecules are ﬁxed) such
a pair is not at the bottom of its energy spectrum and may continue to release energy via
excitation of intra- and intermolecular vibrations and ﬁnally form at equilibrium (in adiabatic
sense) the qf-Ps state discussed in Sec.II.A. In comparison with the binding energy of qf-Ps,
e− pair possesses about 1 eV of excess energy, which is accumulated in the form of a

After losing all its excess potential energy the e+

e− pair becomes the qf-Ps, which
is in thermal equilibrium with the environment. In a disordered medium (for example, in a
liquid) it immediately ﬁnds nearest place with slightly lower density and will stay there, if the
temperature cannot push it out from that shallow trap. This state may survive for a rather
long time (it may be comparable with the free e+ lifetime) in a solid medium, where molecular
rearrangements are energetically forbidden or require longer time.

· · ·

In liquids (or ”soft” media) qf-Ps state continuously evolves into the bubble state at a
longer time scale because of further gain of the e+-e− Coulombic attraction and decrease of the
positronium zero-point kinetic energy. It becomes possible due to rearrangement of molecules
and appearance of additional free space. This is the beginning of the Ps bubble formation stage.
Kinetic energy released during compactiﬁcation of the Ps stimulates further local decrease of
the density. Eventually an equilibrium bubble with the Ps inside is formed. Schematically Ps
formation may be displayed as follows:

It implies that
bubble formation lasts about several picosecond in the majority of liquids. On the similar basis
consideration of the self-localization of the positronium (the last step of Eq.(7)) was suggested
by Khrapak.54

Perhaps molecular crystals (anthracene, acenaphthylene) give us the best example illustrat-
ing the transformation of qf-Ps into the bubble state. It is known that in these substances in
the solid state there are neither longlived nor ”narrow” components in the lifetime and angular
correlation (ACAR) spectra, respectively. So from a viewpoint of experimentalists the Ps atom
does not form there. However when the temperature is slightly above the melting point (in the
liquid phase) Ps formation probability becomes very large (more than 0.6).55,56 According to
our model, it is due to impedance in the solid phase of the qf-Ps transformation to the bubble
state, but in the liquid phase it easily proceeds. As a result, in the solid phase we expect con-
tributions both from free e+ and qf-Ps annihilations, but it might be diﬃcult to resolve them
experimentally. Annihilation parameters of qf-Ps (lifetime and width of its ACAR component)
may be obtained by subtracting from the solid-state annihilation spectra the free e+ contri-
bution, which must be taken (with the same intensity and lifetime; corrections accounting for
the variation in the average electron density at the phase transition may be needed) from the
measurements in the liquid phase.

4. Role of localized species

However, in non-polar liquids, as we shall see below, electron localization takes much longer
loc does not exist on a time scale of Ps formation process.
In polar liquids, like water, one may expect that e+ gets also localized within a time compa-
rable with electron localization. After that, mobility of the particles drastically drops down and
they simply have not enough time to meet each other (time is limited by a free positron lifetime

III. EARLY INTRABLOB PROCESSES: GENERAL FORMULATION

Thus, according to the blob model we assume that Ps formation proceeds via recombination
of the thermalized but not yet localized positron with one of the intrablob quasifree electrons,

However, the positron may easily pick up such an electron from C6F−

Therefore in this case ce(r, t) in Eqs.(10) will stand not for the concentration of the electrons
(as in other liquids), but for the concentration of C6F−

6 anions.

The blob model describes nonhomogeneous kinetics of reactions (8) in terms of concen-
trations of the particles, because the number of particles involved is large and local motion of
quasifree electrons and the positron is fast enough in comparison with Ps formation time (Sect.V
E). In the simplest case the external electric ﬁeld enters diﬀusion-recombination equations (10)
via a drift of the positron distribution (electrons are tightly bounded to ions):

center of the blob), ∆ is the radial part of the Laplace operator, Damb = 2Di is the coeﬃcient

the positron (p), respectively, and kie and kep are the recombination rate constants. Decay rate

As discussed above and in Appendix B, blob species distribution is only slightly disturbed by
the application of an external electric ﬁeld, while the behavior of the positron is very sensitive
to the presence of the ﬁeld. The ﬁeld decreases Ps formation by removal of the positron away
from the blob, which suppresses reaction (8a). In Eqs.(10) this eﬀect is approximately taken
into account through the term, div(v pcp), describing the drift of the positron in external ﬁeld
D. However, we skip polarization interaction between the blob and the positron (see Sec. V G)

13

and neglect deviation of the ﬁeld from its average value within the blob caused by the presence
of ion-electron pairs. We also assume linear proportionality between the drift velocity v p and
D, i.e., v p = bpE = bpD/ε (bp = eDp/T is the positron mobility and ε is the static dielectric
permittivity of the medium; see comments to Table I). This assumption is justiﬁed for D < 100
kV/cm where the nonlinear eﬀect is not signiﬁcant. A more exact way to account for real ﬁeld
distribution at the terminal positron blob is a joint solution of Eqs.(10) and an equation on the
electric ﬁeld E(r) as was done in Appendix C.

Because the motion of the knocked-out electrons during blob formation and subsequent
thermalization obeys the quasi-neutrality condition, it is natural to adopt the following initial
conditions for Eqs.(10):

n0 is the initial number of ion-electron pairs and a2
p are the dispersions of spatial
distributions of the intrablob ion-electron pairs and the positron. These distributions do not
take spatial electron-positron correlations of into account. In contrast with the blob electrons,
the motion of subionizing positron is diﬀusion-like and it may easily escape from the blob.
Hence, dispersion a2
p of the initial positron distribution may signiﬁcantly exceed that of intrablob
species. In contrast to abl, ap is determined by thermalization of the positron, i.e., by its ability
to excite intra- and intermolecular vibrations, while the distribution of the ions in the blob
(i.e. abl) depends on a much more eﬃcient energy loss process – slowing down of the energetic
positron by ionization, when its energy is reduced from Wbl to the ionization potential IL. In
Eq.(11) lp accounts for the drift of the subionizing positron during its thermalization:

Application of the prescribed diﬀusion method to solve Eqs.(10) is based on an assumption
that interaction between thermalized positron and its blob is negligible. In other words, we
adopted that the blob is ”transparent” for e+
qf (we call this approach the ”white blob” model).
This assumption seems reasonable because of two opposite eﬀects which approximately cancel
each other (Sec.IV.G): 1) outdiﬀusion of intrablob electrons makes them to reside in an outer
region of the blob, which results in appearance of an excess positive charge in its central region,
repelling e+ from the blob; 2) the presence of e+ within the blob may lead to rearrangement
of intrablob electrons, which may decrease the total energy of the system because of the Debye
screening.

Thus, in this case fast diﬀusion motion of the quasifree positron on a timescale of its lifetime
τ2) eﬃciently smears the positron distribution and approaches

Note that Eq.(26) contains only one ﬁtting parameter, r0, while Eq.(27) has two. We thus
have more freedom to ﬁt experimental data with Eq.(27). With Eq.(26), we can ﬁt only relative
Ps yield PPs(D)/PPs(0).44,4,23 This is an important diﬀerence between the Onsager model (spur
model) and the blob model. It is also worth mentioning that the dielectric permittivity enters
Eq.(26) and Eq.(27) in a diﬀerent way.

It means that PPs should go to zero at high ﬁelds. However, this regime is deﬁnitely beyond
the applicability of the present theory (for example, inequality µep > 5 implies that D should
be larger than 103 kV/cm). In this case another Ps formation process comes into play (Sect.
III B).

B. e+ annihilation and ion-electron recombination

A more realistic consideration than that in the previous section must take into account at
least e+ annihilation and the possibility of IER (reaction 8c). Both of these processes may
compete with Ps formation. IER equally decreases the number of electrons and ions. If we
neglect as before the diﬀusion expansion of the blob,

IV. COMPARISON WITH EXPERIMENTAL DATA AND DISCUSSIONS

A. PPs(D): Simplest consideration

Here we consider experimental data of Kobayashi and co-workers obtained by means of the
positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy in the following nonpolar liquids: benzene, hexaﬂu-
orobenzene, hexane, cyclohexane, and isooctane.31,23 Air dissolved in the liquids was removed

105 counts for each spectrum. Measured lifetime spectra were decomposed into three
∼
components. The ﬁrst and second components, τ1 =190-310 ps and τ2 (Table I), were assigned
to the annihilation of p-Ps and free positrons. The longest-lived component, τ3, was due to the
ortho-Ps (o-Ps) annihilation in bubbles in liquids (Table I). The o-Ps lifetime was unchanged
by an increase in the external electric ﬁeld.

To compare our theoretical results with experimental data, we relate PPs to the intensity
of o-Ps component I3. We assume that I3 = 3PPs/4
100%. The multiplier 3/4 in this relation
may vary slightly from one liquid to another because of possible Ps interactions with highly
reactive radiolytic products (localized electrons, radicals, and radical-cations).1,30

B. Eﬀect of the positron annihilation and ion-electron recombination

It is seen that the electric ﬁeld eﬀect is stronger in saturated hydrocarbons (cyclohexane,
hexane, isooctane) than in aromatic compounds. Experimental data in Fig.1 in benzene and
especially in hexaﬂuorobenzene indicate that the slope of PPs(D) tends to zero as the ﬁeld
approaches zero. This observation is reasonable if Ps formation competes with e+ annihilation,
e+ localization, or IER. Treatment of the data based on Eq.(32) (solid lines in Fig.1) with

18

a2
bl + a2

Wie=0 and 1/τ loc

p =0 leads to a zero slope of PPs(D) at D=0 and larger values of parameter
p (Table II). The introduction of non-zero values of Wie worsens the ﬁt, but if we allow
that Wie/Wep is 0.005, ﬁnal curves coincide practically with solid lines, that is why we did
q
not plot them. The values of ﬁtting parameters are listed in Table II. Based on these results,
the maximal limiting value of the Wie/Wep ratio was found to be 0.005. Using the numerical
values of abl ≈
30, the ratio of rate constants kie/kep turns out to be very
small, about 10−3 (Table II), which implies that IER cannot compete signiﬁcantly with Ps
formation; note, however, that the values of kie estimated here do not correspond to typical
experimental conditions in radiation chemistry. This indicates that, in the terminal positron
blob, Ps formation proceeds within a shorter time than IER. The following three points make
this clear:

40 ˚A and n0 ≈

1. Both Ps formation and IER reactions depend strongly on the same process – energy
absorption and the transfer of released energy. As discussed in Sect. II D.4, because of the
high density of ion-electron pairs and quasi-neutrality condition in the blob, thermalization and
IER are lengthened. Ps formation proceeds more easily, however, because both particles lose
energy and the total released energy is less than that in IER.

2. kie is proportional to the overlapping of wave functions of a delocalized state (quasifree
electron) and a localized state (positive ion), while kep is proportional to a much larger over-
lapping of the two delocalized wave functions of the quasifree positron and electron.

3. As mentioned above the mobility of e+
larger ratio, Dp/De, proportional to kep/kie.

qf is higher than that of e−

qf (Table I), leading to a

To avoid the strong disagreement with experimental data, we must assume that e+ local-
ization does not proceed in neat liquids. τ loc
p at least should be longer than τ2 (Table II), which
agrees well with our previous conclusion (Sect. II E.2) that e+ localization is unfavorable in
neat nonpolar liquids other than C6F6.

C. e+ localization

D. C6F6

The C6F6 molecule may capture an epithermal electron in a shallow energy level.57 ”Shal-
low” implies that the positron may pick up an electron from C6F−
6 and form a Ps atom. Trapped
electrons escape IER but survive for Ps formation by remaining on a molecule of the liquid.
Localization of intrablob electrons decreases the ψ-function overlapping with e+
qf , which results
in a smaller rate constant kep (Table II). Product Dp
p also turns out to be small, how-
e−2Wep , Eq.(25))
ever, Wep and therefore the Ps formation probability at zero ﬁeld (PPs(0)
is the largest among the liquids investigated. The small value of the positron thermalization
distance in C6F6 qualitatively agrees with the data of Gee and Freeman for the thermalization
distance of the excess electron.61

F. Absence of the ﬁeld dependence of τ3

Experimental data clearly show that lifetime τ3 of the o-Ps atom residing in a bubble, does
not depend on applied electric ﬁeld within ranges of statistical deviations in all investigated
liquids.53 It is well-known that the o-Ps annihilation rate is proportional to the overlapping of
the positron wave function with that of the electrons of the molecules (”pick-oﬀ” process).

G. Electrostatic and polarization eﬀects

More careful inspection of our experimental data at high ﬁelds and other related experimen-
tal results23,4,28 suggests that Ps formation probability tends to reach a plateau. It in fact could
be attributed to a nontrivial role of polarization interaction between the thermalized quasifree
positron and the blob, which is not yet well understood.

Being highly mobile, intrablob electrons tend to reside in an outer region of the blob (Ap-
pendix B). It results in the appearance of a small excess positive charge in its central region,
which repels e+ outward. This potential, Eq.(B7), is about 3T in the center of the blob and
decreases to zero at r & abl.

ﬁelds.

The approach developed here properly takes into account the presence of the blob as an
inhomogeneously distributed large number of ion-electron pairs and assumes that all of the
above polarization eﬀects more or less compensate each other. More accurate consideration
of these electrostatic and polarization eﬀects of the e+-blob interaction is the subject of our
following study (so-called ”black blob” model).63

V. CONCLUSION

The diﬀerence between radiation chemistry and Ps chemistry is related to the diﬀerence in
the objects they study. Being a probe of Ps chemistry, the positron delivers information about
processes near and inside its terminal blob, while radiation chemistry primarily investigates the
processes in isolated spurs. The main diﬀerence between the spur and blob comes from the
factor of 10 diﬀerence in the initial number of ion-electron pairs they contain.

In radiation chemistry, Onsager’s theory of the geminate recombination is adequate for
interpreting free-ion yields and their ﬁeld dependence. On the contrary, the blob model is most
appropriate for considering processes, in particular, Ps formation in the blob. At a limiting
case, the theory we have developed gives a relation which only formally resembles the well-
known Onsager equation of geminate recombination. We generalized the prescribed diﬀusion
method for consideration of the processes in the presence of an external electric ﬁeld.

Thermalization of knocked-out electrons diﬀers from the slowing of the positron. Being
aﬀected by an electric ﬁeld of the parent ion, the electron becomes thermalized at a shorter
distance than the positron, which easily escapes from its electrically neutral center of the blob.
Thus ap becomes larger than the initial ion-electron separation, r0, in a spur. This is also
related to the higher mobility of the thermalized positron compared to the electron mobility.

An investigation of Ps formation in the presence of an external electric ﬁeld enables us to
better understand the behavior of intrablob electrons and the positron – peculiarities of their
thermalization, quasi-neutrality condition, positron out-diﬀusion from the blob, formation of
the quasifree positronium and its transformation to the bubble state.

One of the interesting ﬁndings in our study is that the competition of the Ps formation with
the other processes (like annihilation of positrons in the free state and IER) leads to a zero
derivative of PPs(D) at D = 0. Another surprising but not very unexpected observation is that
IER cannot compete signiﬁcantly with the Ps formation. We found that the ratio of the Ps
formation rate constant to the IER rate constant kep/kie is about 103-104. Diﬀerent conditions
of absorption of released energy in IER and Ps formation in the e+ blob may be responsible for
this result.

In summary, we stress that experiments on Ps formation in the presence of an external
electric ﬁeld are extremely informative both for Ps chemistry and for radiation chemistry, and
should be extended to higher ﬁelds and other substances.

APPENDIX A: ENERGY DEPOSITION AND TRACK STRUCTURE OF FAST
POSITRON

≈

The average initial energy of fast positrons emitted from radioactive nuclei 22Na or 64Cu, fre-
quently used as a source of positrons, is several hundreds of keV. Moving in a liquid, the positron
loses about half of its kinetic energy in rare head-on collisions, knocking out δ-electrons. Tracks
of these electrons form ”branches” around the positron trail. The other half of energy is spent
in numerous glancing collisions with molecules. Average energy loss in such a collision is 30-50
eV (at maximum 100 eV). A secondary electron knocked out in a glancing collision produces,
by turns, a few ion-electron pairs inside a spherical microvolume, called a spur in radiation
chemistry. Its radius, asp, is determined by thermalization of the knocked out electrons in the
presence of the Coulombic attraction of parent ions. Strictly speaking, a2
sp is the dispersion of
the Gaussian distribution function, which corresponds to the end of thermalization process of
the knocked-out e−. Based on64,41, the most probable value of asp in water is estimated to be

30 ˚A.66
While positron energy W > Wcyl, mean distance li between adjacent events of ionization
produced by the positron is greater than spur size 2asp (Fig.2).30 This means that spurs are
separated from each other. The motion of a high energy positron is a quasi-straight line because
li is less than the positron transport path ltr, which is the mean distance passed by the positron
before it changes the initial direction of its motion by 90◦ (detailed in67). When li < 2asp < ltr
or Wbl < W < Wcyl spurs overlap, forming something like a cylindrical ionization column. At
the end of the track, when e+ energy becomes less than blob formation energy Wbl (
500
eV), 2asp becomes the largest parameter: 2asp > li, ltr. This means that the positron starts to
create a blob containing a few tens of ion-electron pairs because the average energy required
for the formation of one ion-electron pair is 16-22 eV.2 Diﬀusion motion of the positron in
the blob becomes more pronounced with decreasing energy. The positron frequently changes
its momentum due to elastic scattering and the ionization of surrounding molecules. Roughly
speaking all intrablob ionizations are conﬁned within the sphere of the radius abl (detailed
deﬁnition see below). The positron ﬁnally becomes subionizing and therefore its energy loss
rate drops down by almost 2 orders of magnitude.41

∼

To gain some insight into typical values of the parameters involved we shall start with
estimations of li(W ) and ltr(W ). Calculation of li(W ) = Wiep/LET(W ) is based on the data
on LET of e± (see, for example, Fig.3.19 in49 or Fig.5 in30). Usually the right side of the
Bragg peak is well described by the Bethe formula for ionization slowing down, but its left (low
energy) side strongly depends on corrections to the Bethe equation which consist in truncation
of the dipole oscillator distribution at the maximum transferable energy.68 From the relationship
li(Wcyl)

2asp we obtain that Wcyl ≈

Estimation of the transport path can be done in the frameworks of the Born approximation
(wavelength of e+ with the energy & 100 eV is small in comparison with the size of molecules).
Below 1 keV ltr(W ) is mainly determined by small-angle electron-positron elastic scattering
(the Rutherford part of the cross-section, related to e+ scattering on nuclei, becomes important

The Born amplitude fB is calculated simulating a molecule of the liquid by an equi-electronic
hydrogen-like atom2,30. Energy dependence of ltr is shown in Fig.3.

At low energies positron scattering becomes more and more eﬃcient and we must regard
e+ motion as diﬀusion-like.
ltr is then considered as the energy-dependent mean free path
between successive ”collisions”, which completely randomize the direction of the velocity of
the particle. If the probability to pass distance r without such a collision is exp(
r/ltr), the
average squared distance r2 is 2l2
tr. After n collisions, the mean square displacement is nr2.
Calculation of the same quantity assuming that particle propagation is governed by the usual
diﬀusion equation gives nr2 = 6Dpt. Thus, we obtain the diﬀusion coeﬃcient of the positron as
Dp(W ) = l2
tr/3τ = ltrvp/3, where vp is e+ velocity and τ = t/n = ¯r/vp = ltr/vp is the average
time between subsequent collisions. Integrating the relationship

Now we are ready to deﬁne the blob formation energy Wbl and the ”radius” abl of the blob.

These quantities are determined from the following equations:

ltr(Wbl) = abl,

abl = Rsd(Wbl, Ry)

abl.

(A4)

−

Their physical meaning is clear from Fig.4. Terminal blob is a spherical microvolume which
conﬁnes the end part of the positron trajectory, where ionization slowing down is the most
eﬃcient (thermalization stage of subionizing positron is not included here). Mathematical for-
mulation of this statement is twofold. Just after the ﬁrst blob formation ”step” (the thick arrow
in Fig.4), ltr(Wbl)) e+ reaches the center of the blob. After that, slowing down displacement of
the positron, Rsd(Wbl, Ry)
abl should be equal to the ”radius” of the blob, abl, i.e. the blob
in average embraces exactly the end part of the e+ ionization slowing down trajectory.

−

Solution of these equations is unique and shown in Fig.3 for the case of liquid water. It is
500 eV and abl = 40 ˚A fulﬁll Eqs.(A4). Actually, we must proceed
seen that numbers Wbl ≈
with all such calculations for each particular liquid investigated by the positron spectroscopy.
However, one may assume that the values of abl, Wbl and other parameters related to slowing
by ionization do not diﬀer signiﬁcantly from one liquid to another, because variations in the
ionization potential and average electron density are small (Table I).

At the end of slowing down by ionization and electronic excitation, the spatial distribution of
the subionizing positron coincides with the distribution of the blob species (i.e.
bl)).
Further, during thermalization, e+ distribution becomes broader (about 30 ˚A in water and 100-
200 ˚A in hydrocarbons), and its total dispersion is expressed as follows:

APPENDIX B: MICROSCOPIC QUASI-EQUILIBRIUM CONDITION FOR IONS
AND ELECTRONS IN THE BLOB

Let us estimate how much the distributions of electrons and ions diﬀer at quasi-neutrality
(quasi-equilibrium) condition which is achieved immediately after the electrons adjust them-
selves to the current distribution of ions. As discussed before Eq.(3), it is reasonable to use
Gaussian distribution functions to describe the spatial distribution of ions and electrons by the
end of the thermalization stage:

At the quasi-equilibrium, the electron ﬂux should equal to zero everywhere. However, here we
use the approximate (gaussian) functions instead of true distribution functions, so we can fulﬁll
this condition only for a given value of r, for example, at r = abl:

Note that the application of an external ﬁeld of about 30 kV/cm to a liquid does not
signiﬁcantly perturb the ion-electron distribution in the blob. It leads to less than 1 ˚A shift of
the electron distribution with respect to the ions.

APPENDIX C: AMBIPOLAR DIFFUSION EXPANSION OF THE BLOB

Even neglecting ion-electron recombination, the out-diﬀusion of the blob species (electrons
and ions) can not be considered independently because of the strong electrostatic interaction
between charged particles. The intrablob electric ﬁeld eﬃciently suppresses out-diﬀusion of the
electrons but increases (duplicates) the ion diﬀusion coeﬃcient.65 Coupled diﬀusion equations
are written as

Di and De are the local diﬀusion coeﬃcients of ions and electrons and ∆ stands for the Laplace
operator. Our aim now is to relate them to the kinetics of blob expansion. As before, Eqs.(3)
are used as initial conditions. To Eqs.(C1), we add the Poisson equation for an electrostatic
potential ϕ(r):

In Appendix A, we demonstrate that the spatial distribution of electrons is very close to that
ci or ce. Using Eq.(C2), we evaluate the second terms in the right
of ions, so δc = ci −

This means that the term ∆ci is duplicated in Eq.(C1a). The motion of ions in the blob thus
obeys the simple diﬀusion equation, but with a twice larger diﬀusion coeﬃcient:

This process is called ambipolar diﬀusion and Damb = 2Di is the ambipolar diﬀusion coeﬃcient.
Half of it is related to the diﬀusion of ions and the rest is due to the electric ﬁeld of blob electrons.

66 Numbers for asp listed here can not be directly compared with the known radiation-chemical values
of ion-electron separation in water. In our case distributions of intraspur species (and by analogy
with the intrablob species) are centered in the origin of the coordinate, while in radiation chemistry
the distribution of the knocked out electron is centered on the parent cation. Thus, mean square
ion-electron separation is related to asp in the following way:

Broken lines represent the ﬁt according to Eq.(22), which does not account for the free positron

positron annihilation with the lifetime τ2 and IER (Wie/Wep = 0.003) are taken into account
in Eq.(32). The lines which account only eﬀect of the positron annihilation lie in between
respective dashed and solid lines and not shown here. Experimental data suggests the presence
of IER on the level Wie/Wep < 0.005 or positron localization with a rate lower than 1/τ2.

The ﬁrst line for each liquid corresponds to the ﬁt based on Eq.(22) (dashed lines in Fig.1), which
does not account for free positron annihilation. We list these numbers to show the simplest
limiting case of the theory. These numbers diﬀer from corresponding data in31 because the
ﬁeld-dependent bias of subionizing positron during its thermalization is taken into account in
the present work.
Numbers on the second line show the ﬁt including positron annihilation with lifetime τ2 based
on Eqs.(32-33), but IER was not taken into account.
Data on the third line corresponds to the same case as above, but positron localization is
assumed with the rate 1/τ loc
p = 1/τ2. Respective curves for PPs(D) in the last two cases are not
shown in Fig.1. They are in between the dashed and the solid lines.
Numbers on the last line of each group are obtained based on Eq.(32), where, together with the
positron annihilation with the rate τ −1
, a ﬁxed fraction of IER is introduced: Wie/Wep = 0.003
(maximum possible level still acceptable by experimental data).
kep and kie are recalculated from
p, Wep and Wie via Eq.(21) and Eq.(31). It is assumed
that n0 = 30, abl = 40 ˚A and Dp = T bp/e, where bp is taken from Table I (e+ mobility for
cyclohexane is assumed to be the same as for hexane).

Extraction of Thermodynamic Data
from Ternary Diﬀusion Coeﬃcients of
Lysozyme Chloride in Water and
Aqueous Na2SO4

Abstract

This paper presents, for ternary lysozyme-Na2SO4-water system, the
thermodynamic data extracted from the measured values of four ter-
nary diﬀusion coeﬃcients and the Onsager reciprocal relations. The
calculation for derivatives of solute chemical potentials with respect
to solute molar concentrations was made using the method presented
in [1]. This method is applicable to systems in which the molar con-
centration of one solute is very small compared to that of the other,
like in our case. The approach is illustrated for the lysozyme chloride-
Na2SO4-water system at 25o C, pH 4.5 and at 0.6 mM (8.6 mg/mL)
lysozyme chloride and 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.65, and 0.8 M Na2SO4 con-
centrations. The calculated solute chemical potential derivatives were
used to compute the protein cation charge approximately. We also
compute the diﬀusion Onsager coeﬃcients (Lij)o for each composition
at pH 4.5.

Motivation

In order to determine the protein structure through X-ray diﬀraction, high
quality crystals are required. The protein crystallization process usually oc-
curs in aqueous solution that contain salts as precipitant agents. The phys-
ical and chemical properties of these solutions aﬀect drastically the nucle-
ation and crystal growth processes. Protein aggregation depends on protein-
protein and protein-precipitant interactions in the solution. In these inter-
actions, the eﬀective charge of the protein plays an important role. From
titration experiments [2] only the stoichiometric value of the protein charge
can be determine, but it does not take into account the presence of ions
that may bind on the macromolecules and change their net charge as already
shown by diﬀusion experiments [3].

The diﬀusion of protein is one of the fundamental processes occurring in
biological systems, and it is also an important step in the crystallization
mechanism. Crystallization is an intrinsically non-equilibrium process, and
concentration gradients will occur around the crystal. The protein crystal-
lizes, reducing its concentration at the moving face of the growing crystal
and creating a protein gradient between the bulk solution and the crystal.
This gradient in turn causes multicomponent diﬀusive transport of protein
and precipitant. Diﬀusion in protein crystal growth inevitably occurs under
conditions for which no species has an uniform concentration raising the issue
of multicomponent diﬀusion.

The complete description of an n-solute system requires an n × n matrix
of diﬀusion coeﬃcients relating the ﬂux of each solute component to the
gradients of all solute components [4]. The importance of other species on
protein diﬀusion follows from the one-dimensional ﬂux relations [4]:

− J =

(Dij)v∂Cj/∂x

i = 1, ...., n

(1)

n

j=1
X

in which the cross-term diﬀusion coeﬃcients (oﬀ-diagonal elements (Dij)v i 6=
j) can be positive or negative. In ternary systems (n = 2), our case, the one-
dimensional ﬂux relations could be written as:

− J1 = (D11)v

+ (D12)v

(2)

∂C2
∂x

∂C1
∂x

2

−J2 = (D21)v

+ (D22)v

∂C1
∂x

∂C2
∂x

where J1 and J2 - the protein ﬂux and respectively salt ﬂux, (D11)v and (D22)v
- the main-term diﬀusion coeﬃcients relating to the ﬂux of component to its
own concentration gradient, and (D12)v and (D21)v - the cross-term diﬀusion
coeﬃcients relating the ﬂux of each component to the gradient of the other.
The index v from the diﬀusion coeﬃcients shows that the experiment were
done under the assumption the volume change on mixing and changes in
concentrations across the diﬀusion boundary were small. Consequently, with
a good approximation, the measured diﬀusion coeﬃcients may be considered
to be for the volume-ﬁxed reference frame [5] deﬁned by:

(3)

(4)

Ji ¯Vi = 0

n

i=0
X

where ¯Vi is the partial molar volume of the ith species, and the subscript 0
denotes the solvent.
The importance of multicomponent diﬀusion has been recognized in the crys-
tal growth community [6, 7] and a crystal growth model has properly ac-
counted for multicomponent diﬀusive transport in lysozyme chloride-NaCl-
water system [8, 1]. The experimental multicomponent diﬀusion coeﬃcients
are essential for accurate modeling of protein transport, especially in view
of the very large cross-term coeﬃcient (D21)v reported here. Moreover, the
concentration of supporting electrolyte dependence of all the diﬀusion coeﬃ-
cients should be important for supersaturation region and also for its directly
contribution to the protein ﬂux.
The use of ternary diﬀusion coeﬃcients to determine binding coeﬃcients and
other thermodynamic data is very well established [9, 10] . For our ternary
system, the molar concentration of one solute is very small compared to that
of the other, and also small enough that an inverse concentration dependence
dominates certain activity coeﬃcient derivatives. For such systems, using
the Onsager reciprocal relations (ORR), along with precision measurements
of ternary diﬀusion coeﬃcients from our earlier paper [11], we determined
concentration derivatives of the chemical potentials (µij ≡ ∂µi/∂Cj) of two
solutes with respect to one solute molar concentrations.
In our ternary experiments, the molarity of lysozyme chloride is small com-
pared to that of Na2SO4. Thus, the self-derivative for lysozyme chloride, µ11,
is dominated by its concentration term. The self-derivative µ22 for Na2SO4

3

is essentially that of the binary with minor correction. In order to obtain the
molarity cross-derivatives (µ12 and µ21 which are unequal [12]) we have to
use two additional equations: (1) equality of the molality cross-derivatives
[13]:

∂µ1
∂m2

=

∂µ2
∂m1

(5)

(6)

where mi is the molality of solute i, and (2) the ORR equation:

µ11(D12)o − µ12(D21)o = µ22(D21)o − µ21(D22)o

relating the four molarity derivatives and the ternary difussion coeﬃcients in
a solvent-ﬁxed reference frame (Dij)o [14, 15]. This method [1] yields to an
estimate of lysozyme charge and a functional approximation to the change
of the chemical potential of lysozyme chloride with Na2SO4 concentration.
This, together with the diﬀusion coeﬃcients, will permit the modeling of
protein crystallization processes.

Experimental section

All the experimental work was performed al Texas Christian University, in
the Chemistry Department.

Materials. All the materials, solution preparation procedures, apparatus
and density measurement procedures are described in the work [8]. We used
a hen egg-white lysozyme, recrystallized six times purchased from Seikagaku
America.
The molecular mass of the lysozyme solute, M1, was taken as 14307 g/mol,
and this value [16] was used to calculate all concentrations after correction
for the moisture and chloride content. Buoyancy corrections were made with
the commonly used lysozyme crystal density [17, 18, 19] of 1.305 g/cm3.
The molecular mass of water, Mo, was taken as 18.015 g/cm3 and the molec-
ular mass of Na2SO4, M2, was taken as 142.037 g/mol.
Mallinckrodt reagent HCl (∼ 12 M) was diluted by half with pure water
and distilled at the constant boiling composition. This resulting HCl solu-
tion (∼ 6 M) was then diluted (pH 1.2) and used to adjust the pH of solution.

4

Preparation of Solutions. All solutions were prepared by mass with ap-
propriate buoyancy corrections. All weighings were performed with a Met-
tler Toledo AT400 electrobalance. Since the as-received lysozyme powder
was very hygroscopic, all manipulations in which water absorption might be
critical were performed in a dry glove box. Stock solutions of lysozyme were
made by adding as-received protein to a pre-weighted bottle that had con-
tained dry box air, capping the bottle, and reweighing to get the weight and
thus mass of lysozyme. Water was added to dissolve the lysozyme, and the
solution was weighed. An accurate density measurement was made and used
to obtain the molarity of the stock solution.
For ternary experiments, precise masses of Na2SO4 were added to ﬂasks con-
taining previously weighed quantities of lysozyme stock solutions. These
solutions were mixed and diluted to within 10 cm3 of the ﬁnal volume. The
pH was adjusted, and the solutions were diluted to their ﬁnal mass.

Measurements of pH. The pH measurements were made using a Corn-
ing model 130 pH meter with an Orion model 8102 combination ROSS pH
electrode. The meter was calibrated with standard pH 7 and pH 4 buﬀers
and checked against a pH 5 standard buﬀer.

Density Measurements. All density measurements were made with a
Mettler-Paar DMA40 density meter, with an RS-232 output to a Apple Π+.
By time averaging the output, a precision of 0.00001 g/cm3 or better could
be achieved. The temperature of the vibrating tube in the density meter was
controlled with water from a large well-regulated water bath whose temper-
ature was 25.00± 0.01 o C.

Free-Diﬀusion Measurements. For binary Na2SO4-water and ternary
Lys-Na2SO4-Water we performed measurements for free-diﬀusion using the
high-precision Gosting diﬀusiometer [20, 21, 22] operated in its Rayleigh in-
terferometric optical mode. The procedure for measuring binary (D2)v and
ternary diﬀusion coeﬃcients (Dij)v were described in detail in the work [8].
In order to measure the four diﬀusion coeﬃcients of the system, the exper-
iments must be performed with at least two diﬀerent concentration diﬀer-
ences at each combination of mean concentration [20, 23, 24]. For ternary
experiments, for each pair of mean concentrations, two measurements were
performed with α1 = 0 and the two with α1 = 0.8 (αi - the refractive index
fraction due to the ith solute [8]).

5

In order to make the data analysis of the free-diﬀusion experiments we used
the Fick’s second law:

∂Ci
∂t

=

Dij

∂2Cj
∂x2

2

j=1
X

i = 1, 2

(7)

for two solutes. We made the assumption that the concentration diﬀerences
of the solutes across the initial boundary are small enough and the diﬀusion
coeﬃcients are constant [25]. Also the volume changes on mixing were neg-
ligible, thus all the measured diﬀusion coeﬃcients are given relative to the
volume-ﬁxed frame of reference deﬁned by equation (4). Also we could made
a comparison with the dynamic light scattering [27] results from our previous
paper [11].

Results

Ternary diﬀusion experiments were performed on the lysozyme chloride-
Na2SO4-water system at pH= 4.5 and T=250 C. The four ternary diﬀusion
coeﬃcients obtained, (D11)v, (D22)v, (D12)v and (D21)v were published in our
earlier paper [11] for a mean Na2SO4 concentration of 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.65 and
0.8 M. The interferometric data for the diﬀusion coeﬃcients (D11)v, (D22)v,
(D12)v and (D21)v are reported in the Tables 1,2,3.

Partial molar volumes values, ¯V1, ¯V2 and ¯Vo, were calculated for each
component using eqs A-7 (q = 2) and 5 in [14] and reported in the Tables
1,2,3.
Values of mean density ¯d and Hi = (∂d/∂Ci)T,p,Cj,j6=i in the Tables 1,2,3
were calculated using densities of all eight solutions from each experiment
set. Densities were assumed to be linear in solute concentrations respecting
the equation [8]:

d = ¯d + H1(C1 − ¯¯C1) + H2(C2 − ¯¯C2)

(8)

where ¯¯C1 and ¯¯C2 are the averages of the mean concentrations for all four
experiments in a series.

Use of irreversible thermodynamics and diﬀusion data to calcu-
late chemical potential derivatives. For our ternary system lysozyme

6

chloride-Na2SO4, the molar concentration of a macromolecule and the sup-
porting electrolyte are small and large, respectively. So, in this case it is
possible to estimate the chemical potential derivatives µ11 and µ22 [1].
The molality cross-derivative relation, eq.(5), comes from classical thermo-
dynamics. From eq. (5), an expression can be derived relating the four mo-
larity partial derivatives µij [26]. The eq.(6), the ternary ORR of irreversible
thermodynamics, relates the four (Dij)o values of diﬀusion coeﬃcients in a
solvent-ﬁxed reference frame and the four µij values [14, 15].

Fundamental equations. The analysis of chemical potential derivatives
was made in terms of quantities referred to a solvent-ﬁxed reference frame,
identify by a subscript 0, with the diﬀusion Onsager coeﬃcients denoted
by (Lij)o. The solvent-ﬁxed (Dij)o values shown in the Tables 1,2,3 were
obtained from experimental volume-ﬁxed (Dij)v values by standard equations
involving the ¯Vi [1, 18, 19].
The diﬀusion Onsager coeﬃcients (Lij)o and the solvent-ﬁxed (Dij)o diﬀusion
coeﬃcients are related (in matrix form) by:

(L11)oµ11 + (L12)oµ21
(L21)oµ11 + (L22)oµ21

(cid:20)

The inverse realtion is:

(D11)o
(D21)o

(D12)o
(D22)o (cid:21)
(cid:20)
(L11)oµ12 + (L12)oµ22

µ22(D21)o − µ21(D22)o µ11(D22)o − µ12(D21)o (cid:21)
Since the ORR, (L12)o = (L21)o [14, 15] apply to the solvent-ﬁxed frame, eq.
(10) yields eq. (6).
Also, from eq. (5) for cross-derivative molality and the relations between Ci
and mi, we can show that [11]:

where Mo is the molecular mass of water.
In order to calculate the µij molarity cross-derivatives, we took in account
their general thermodynamics expressions in terms of volume concentrations
and the corresponding mean ionic activity coeﬃcients yi for volume concen-
trations [26], and also we assumed that lysozyme chloride has stoichiometry
LyClzp. Thus, the µij for our case could be written in a matrix form as:

where the quantity zp/2C1 + C2 is equivalent to the total normality N of our
ternary solution.
Using the eq.(12) we computed the partial derivatives of chemical potentials,
µij, for the case in which the molarity of at least one component is very low.
From eq.(12) we calculated the µ11 and µ22 taking in account the terms which
are dominant for our case. In order to calculate the other two derivatives
chemical potentials, µ12 and µ21 we use the eqs. (6) and (11) and the four
(Dij)o:

µ12 = {µ11[C1 ¯V2(D22)o − (1 − C1 ¯V1)(D12)o] −
µ22[C2 ¯V1(D22)o − (1 − C1 ¯V1)(D21)o]}/
{(1 − C2 ¯V2(D22)o − (1 − C1 ¯V1)(D11)o}
µ21 = {µ11[C1 ¯V2(D11)o − (1 − C2 ¯V2)(D12)o] −
µ22[C2 ¯V1(D11)o − (1 − C2 ¯V2)(D21)o]}/
{(1 − C2 ¯V2(D22)o − (1 − C1 ¯V1)(D11)o}

(13)

(14)

All the values for derivative chemical potentials µij are reported in the Tables
1,2,3 for each salt concentration.
Using the eqs. (10), (12), (13) and (14) we calculated the thermodynamics
transport coeﬃcients (Lij)o for pH 4.5 and C1 = 0.60 mM, which are reported
also in the Tables 1,2,3.

Calculation of lysozyme chloride charge using the values for µ12 and
µ21 is described in [1]. Looking into eq. (12), the expressions for µ12 and µ21
suggest that we can obtain the lysozyme chloride charge multiplying µ12/RT

8

and µ21/RT by zp/2C1 + C2 and we’ll receive the following dependence:

Y12 = (zp/2C1 + C2)

= zp + (zp/2C1 + C2)(zp + 1)

Y21 = (zp/2C1 + C2)

= zp + 2(zp/2C1 + C2)

The dependence of Y21 and Y21 on (zp/2C1 + C2) is shown in the Fig.1. From
the graph we could estimate the protein charge, zp and to compare it with
the value obtain from thermodynamics data from [1]. At pH 4.5 ,the average
value of zp obtained from eqs. (15) and (16) is zp = 3.29, in comparison
with the value obtained, using the same approach, for lysozyme-NaCl-Water
system, zp = 8.9. This data were obtained from thermodynamics data for
ternary system, which were in turn obtained in part from transport data.

Conclusions We reported the complete set of multicomponent diﬀusion co-
eﬃcients for ternary lys-Na2SO4-water system at concentrations high enough
to be relevant to crystallization studies, in the volume-ﬁxed frame, (Dij)v and
in the solvent-ﬁxed frame, (Dij)o. Also we calculated the derivatives chem-
ical potentials µij for our ternary system and after that we estimated the
lysozyme chloride charge, zp, from irreversible thermodynamics and diﬀu-
sion data. We also reported the four thermodynamics transport coeﬃcients
(Lij)o at pH 4.5 and C1 = 0.60 mM.

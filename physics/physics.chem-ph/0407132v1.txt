Abstract

We apply a Langevin model to investigate the nonlinear ac responses

of electro-magnetorheological (ERMR) ﬂuids under the application of two

crossed dc magnetic (z axis) and electric (x axis) ﬁelds and a probing ac

sinusoidal magnetic ﬁeld. We focus on the inﬂuence of the magnetic ﬁelds

which can yield nonlinear behaviors inside the system due to the particles with

a permanent magnetic dipole moment. Based on a perturbation approach, we

extract the harmonics of the magnetic ﬁeld and orientational magnetization

analytically. To this end, we ﬁnd that the harmonics are sensitive to the

degree of anisotropy of the structure as well as the ﬁeld frequency. Thus, it

is possible to real-time monitor the structure transformation of ERMR ﬂuids

by detecting the nonlinear ac responses.

I. INTRODUCTION

Electro-magnetorheological (ERMR) ﬂuids [1,2] behave as both electrorheological (ER)

ﬂuids [3–6] and magnetorheological (MR) ﬂuids [7–9], and are, in general, particle suspen-

sions where the particles have large dielectric constants and permanent magnetic moments.

In fact, there exist a variety of particles which can be polarized by both electric ﬁeld and

magnetic ﬁeld [10]. For instance, there is one candidate for this system, namely, a suspension

of titanium-coated iron particles in a silicon oil [11]. As the external electric ﬁeld or mag-

netic ﬁeld exceeds a threshold, ER or MR ﬂuids turn into a semi-solid, the ground state of

which is a body-centered-tetragonal (bct) lattice. For an ERMR solid, one [1] proposed that

a structure transformation of the ERMR solid from the bct lattice to some other lattices can

appear when a magnetic ﬁeld is simultaneously applied perpendicular to the electric ﬁeld.

To one’s interest, such a structure transformation from bct to face-centered-cubic lattice was

experimentally observed as the ratio between the magnetic and the electric ﬁelds exceeded

a minimum value [2]. Recently, one of the present authors showed that an alternative struc-

ture transformation from the bct structure to the fcc can appear under the application of

electric ﬁelds only [12].

Electric or magnetic ﬁelds of high strength applied to the ERMR solid produce a nonlin-

earity in the dependence of the polarization or magnetization on the ﬁeld strength. Conse-

quently, in the presence of an ac electric or magnetic ﬁeld, the electrical or magnetic response

will in general consist of ac ﬁelds at frequency of the higher-order harmonics [13–16]. A con-

venient method of probing the nonlinear characteristics of the composite is to measure the

harmonics of the nonlinear polarization (or magnetization) under the application of a sinu-

soidal ac ﬁeld [17]. In this case, the strength of the nonlinear polarization or magnetization

should be reﬂected in the magnitude of the harmonics. For extracting such harmonics, the

perturbation approach [18,19] and self-consistent method [19,20] can be used. To the best

of our knowledge, no work has been done on the nonlinear ac responses of ERMR ﬂuids.

For the present system under consideration, the nonlinearity can be caused to appear

2

by two eﬀects, namely, normal saturation and anomalous saturation. In detail, the normal

saturation arises from the higher terms of the Langevin function at large ﬁeld intensities [21].

In contrast, the anomalous saturation results from the equilibrium between entities with

higher and lower dipole moments which is shifted under the inﬂuence of the ﬁeld [21].

Our formalism will hold for the coupling between the normal saturation and anomalous

In the present paper, to investigate the structural eﬀect on the nonlinear ac responses

of ERMR solids, we shall apply a Langevin model to derive the orientational magnetization

as well as the magnetic ﬁeld inside the ERMR solid. In this connection, the perturbation

approach will be used to to extract the harmonics of the magnetic ﬁeld and orientational

saturation.

magnetization.

This paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we apply the Langevin model to derive

the orientational magnetization as well as the magnetic ﬁeld inside the ERMR slid, and

calculate the eﬀective permeability of the ERMR solid by using a generalized Clausius-

Mossotti equation. Also, based on the perturbation approach, we extract the harmonics of

the magnetic ﬁeld and orientational magnetization analytically. In Sec. III, we numerically

investigate these harmonics as a function of the degree of anisotropy of the structure, as well

as the frequency of the ac magnetic ﬁeld. This is followed by a discussion and conclusion in

Sec. IV.

II. FORMALISM

A. Nonlinear characteristics

Under the application of a strong magnetic ﬁeld along z axis, a nonlinear characteristic

can appear in the ERMR ﬂuid, due to the particles with a permanent magnetic dipole

moment p0. Accordingly, the dependence of the magnetic induction B on the ﬁeld H0 will

be nonlinear [21]

where χ and µe stand for the nonlinear susceptibility and eﬀective permeability for the

longitudinal ﬁeld case, respectively. In this case, the eﬀective permeability µe is determined

by the generalized Clausius-Mossotti equation [12]

where µ2 represents the permeability of the host ﬂuid, N1 the number density of the par-

ticles, kB the Boltzmann constant, T the absolute temperature, f the frequency of the

applied magnetic ﬁeld, τ1 the relaxation time of the particles, and α1 the magnetizability

of the particles. In Eq. (2), the longitudinal demagnetizing factor gL deserves a thorough

consideration. For an isotropic array of magnetic dipoles, the demagnetizing factor will be

diagonal with the diagonal element gL = 1/3. However, in an anisotropic array like ERMR

solids, the demagnetizing factor can still be diagonal, but it deviates from 1/3. In fact, the

degree of anisotropy of the system is just measured by how gL is deviated from 1/3. It is

worth noting that gL ≤ 1/3 in the present longitudinal ﬁeld case. Furthermore, there is a

sum rule for the factors, gL +2gT = 1 [19,22], where gT denotes the transverse demagnetizing

factor. Such factors were measured by means of computer simulations [23,24]. Thus, to in-

vestigate the anisotropic structural information of the array, we have to modify the Clausius-

Mossotti equation accordingly by including the demagnetizing factor. The substitution of

gL(= gT ) = 1/3 into Eq. (2) yields the usual (isotropic) Clausius-Mossotti equation, which

does not include the particle-particle interaction. In fact, when we studied the ﬁeld-induced

structure transformation in ER solids, we developed the generalized Clausius-Mossotti equa-

tion [12] by introducing a local-ﬁeld factor β′ which reﬂects the particle-particle interaction

between the particles in a lattice.

In detail, the generalized Clausius-Mossotti approach

[Eq. (2)] is a self-consistent determination of the local ﬁeld due to a lattice of dipole mo-

ments. That is, Eq. (2) should be expected to include the particle-particle interaction, and

the degree of the particle-particle interaction depends on how much gL deviates from 1/3
(note that gL = β′/3). Indeed our numerical results will also show that as gL deviates from

4

1/3 more (namely, more and more particle chains are formed, and the particle-particle in-

teraction becomes more and more strong, too), the obtained harmonics become more large

accordingly, see Figs. 1-2. These harmonics just reﬂect the magnitude of the nonlinear

susceptibility, as expected.

In Eq. (2), the term p2

0/(3kBT ) results from the average contribution of the permanent

magnetic dipole moment to the average value of the work required to bring a particle into

the ﬁeld H0. More precisely, the mean value of the component of the permanent dipole

moment in the direction of the ﬁeld is given by

with γ = p0H0/(kBT ). That is, we set the Langevin function

p0L(γ) =

L(γ) = γ/3.

Regarding this linear relation in use, we should make some remarks. In the present work,

we shall adopt the perturbation approach [25], which is suitable for weak nonlinearity. In

this perturbation approach, it is well established that the eﬀective third-order nonlinear

susceptibility can be calculated from the linear ﬁeld [26], while the eﬀective higher-order

nonlinearity must depend on the nonlinear ﬁeld [25]. Alternatively, we could adopt the self-

consistent method [19], but the perturbation approach appears to be more convenient for

analytic expressions [19]. Thus, for focusing on (weak) third-order nonlinearity, it suﬃces

to use the Clausius-Mossotti equation [Eq. (2)] by taking into account of the linear relation

[Eq. (4)] only. Due to the same reason, the contribution from the nonlinear ﬁeld will be

omitted throughout the paper.

In the present work, the magnetization can be split up to two parts, i.e., the induced

magnetization due to the magnetizability of the particles and the orientation magnetization

Mor due to the alignment of permanent magnetic dipole moments inside the particles. Let

us now consider the orientation magnetization Mor of a sphere of volume V , containing

n1 particles with a permanent magnetic dipole moment pd [see Eq. (8)] embedded in a

continuum with permeability µ∞ [see Eq. (9)]. The sphere is surrounded by an inﬁnite

medium with the same macroscopic properties as the sphere.

The average component in the direction of the ﬁeld of the magnetic dipole moment due

where e denotes the unit vector in the direction of the external ﬁeld, and X stands for

the set of position and orientation variables of all particles. Here u is the energy related

to the dipoles in the sphere, and it consists of three parts: the energy of the dipoles in

the external ﬁeld ude, the magnetostatic interaction energy of the dipoles umi, the non-

magnetostatic interaction energy between the dipoles unmi which is responsible for the short-

range correlation between orientations and positions of the dipoles. Regarding the particle-

particle interaction energy, Eq. (2) should be expected to contain both umi and unmi (at

least to some extent) as gL is not equal to 1/3. Nevertheless, for the numerical calculations

in the next section, Eqs. (39) and (40) will be used which mean that unmi is omitted due to

the predominant external magnetic ﬁeld. In Eq. (7), Md is given by

n1

Md =

(pd)i,

(8)

Xi=1
with pd = p0(µ∞ + 2µ2)/3µ2, where µ∞ represents the permeability at frequencies at which

the permanent dipoles cannot follow the changes of the ﬁeld but where the atomic and

the electronic magnetization are still the same as in the static ﬁeld. Therefore, µ∞ is the

6

permeability characteristic for the induced magnetization. In practice, µ∞ can be expressed

in the expression containing an intrinsic dispersion,

µ∞ = µ∞(0) +

∆µ
1 + if /fc

,

where µ∞(0) is the high-frequency limit permeability, and ∆µ stands for the magnetic dis-

persion strength with a characteristic frequency fc.

The external ﬁeld in this model is equal to the ﬁeld within a spherical cavity ﬁlled with

a continuum of permeability µ∞, while the cavity is situated in a medium with permeability

µe. This ﬁeld is called Fr¨ohlich ﬁeld HF , as given by the Fr¨ohlich model [21,27]

HF =

In this equation, higher-order terms have been omitted. Regarding the derivation of the

nonlinear Fr¨ohlich ﬁeld [Eq. (10)], here we would like to add some comments. For the

spherical cavity under consideration, the linear cavity ﬁeld (i.e., linear Fr¨ohlich ﬁeld) H lin
F

can be easily obtained by solving the usual electrostatic equation. That is, it should be

the ﬁrst term of the right-hand side of Eq. (10). Next, to obtain the present nonlinear

Fr¨olich ﬁeld HF , following Ref. [21] we took one step forward to develop H lin

F in a Taylor

series around µe and neglecting terms in H 4

0 and higher powers of H0. It is worth noting

that the higher powers of H0 can also contribute to the resulting harmonics. However, this

contribution is small enough to be neglected.

B. Nonlinear magnetization and high-order harmonics

1. Longitudinal ﬁeld

For the longitudinal ﬁeld case, there is H0(t) = Hdc + Hac(t) = Hdc + Hac sin ωt along z

axis, with ω = 2πf. Here Hdc denotes the dc ﬁeld which induces the anisotropic structure

in the ERMR solid, and Hac(t) stands for a sinusoidal ac ﬁeld. Then, the Fr¨ohlich ﬁeld is a

superposition of odd- and even- order harmonics such that

HF = H (dc)

F + Hω sin ωt + H2ω cos 2ωt + H3ω sin 3ωt + · · · .

(23)

Accordingly, the orientational magnetization contains harmonics as

Mor = M (dc)

or + Mω sin ωt + M2ω cos 2ωt + M3ω sin 3ωt + · · · .

(24)

where the harmonics (Hω, H2ω, H3ω, Mω, M2ω, and M3ω) and the dc components (H (dc)

(3/4) sin ωt − (1/4) sin 3ωt.

2. Transverse ﬁeld

For the transverse ﬁeld case, only a sinusoidal electric ﬁeld H0(t) = Hac sin ωt is applied

along x axis. In this connection, the Fr¨ohlich ﬁeld is a superposition of odd-order harmonics

HF = Hω sin ωt + H3ω sin 3ωt + · · · .

Accordingly, the orientational magnetization contains harmonics as

Mor = Mω sin ωt + M3ω sin 3ωt + · · · .

In Eqs. (33) and (34), the harmonics Hω, H3ω, Mω, M3ω can be expressed as

case. For the transverse ﬁeld case, χ′ is induced to appear by the moderate ac magnetic ﬁeld

only. Thus, in view of Eqs. (7) and (8), we ﬁnd χ′ ≪ χ (χ is caused to appear by both the

moderate ac and high dc magnetic ﬁelds in the longitudinal ﬁeld case, as mentioned above).

As a result, the third-order harmonics of the Fr¨ohlich ﬁeld and orientational magnetization

are much smaller in the transverse ﬁeld case than in the longitudinal ﬁeld case.

In this

regard, for the following numerical calculations, we shall focus on the longitudinal ﬁeld case

only.

Eqs. (39) and (40) imply that the correlation between the dipole moments of the particles

and in turn the anomalous saturation are neglected in the sense that the current anomalous

saturation is much more weak. This is reasonable because, in the presence of a magnetic

ﬁeld, the permanent magnetic moments of the particles are easily directed along the ﬁeld.

Therefore, the equilibrium between the higher dipole moment (of particle chains) and the

lower dipole moment (of particle chains) might not be able to predict signiﬁcant nonlinearity,

when compared to the normal saturation.

For numerical calculations, take the following parameters: Hdc = 100 Oe, Hac = 1 Oe,
µ∞(0) = 1.1, ∆µ = 8, fc = 4.8 × 103 Hz, µ2 = 1, p0 = 10−13 emu, τ1 = 4.8 × 10−7 s, and
α1 = 10−10 cm−3. In addition, the radius of particle is taken to be 5 µm, and the volume

fraction of the particles is 0.2.

Fig. 1 shows the fundamental, second- and third- order harmonics of the Fr¨ohlich ﬁeld as

a function of the ﬁeld frequency, for various gL in the longitudinal ﬁeld case. In this ﬁgure, a

peak is observed always due to the existence of an intrinsic dispersion [Eq. (9)]. In particular,

as the system changes from isotropic case (gL = 1/3) to anisotropic (gL 6= 1/3) because of

the appearence of the particle chains, the harmonics of the ﬁeld can be changed accordingly.

In detail, stronger anisotropy (namely, decreasing the longitudinal demagnizing factor gL)

leads to larger harmonics, especially in the low-frequency region. Similar eﬀect can be shown

in Fig. 2 where the harmonics of the orientational magnetization in the longitudinal ﬁeld case

are investigated for various gL as well. However, the fundamental harmonic of the orientation

magnetization [see Fig. 2(a)] behaves in a diﬀerent way from that of the Fr¨ohlich ﬁeld [see

11

Fig. 1(a)]. In detail, as the frequency increases, this fundamental harmonic decreases ﬁrst,

then increases, and after reaching a peak they decreases again.

For the transverse ﬁeld case, it could be concluded that as the demagtizing factor gL

decreases, both the fundamental and third-order harmonics of the Fr¨ohlich ﬁeld and orien-

tation magnetization are caused to decrease accordingly, which is just opposite with those

obtained from the longitudinal ﬁeld case (no ﬁgures shown here). The reason is that there

is a sum rule between gL and gT , gL + 2gT = 1.

In a word, for the longitudinal ﬁeld case, besides the odd-order harmonics, the even-order

harmonics are also induced to appear due to the coupling between the applied dc and ac

magnetic ﬁelds along z axis [see Figs. 1 and 2, or Eqs. (23)∼(32)] even though only the cubic

nonlinearity [Eq. (1)] is considered due to the virtue of symmetry of the system. On the

other hand, for the transverse ﬁeld case (i.e., there is only a single ac magnetic ﬁeld applied

along x axis), in view of the cubic nonlinearity [Eq. (1)] of interest, only the odd-order

harmonics are induced, as already predicted by Eqs. (33)∼(38).

In addition, even though there is no particle-particle interaction (i.e., umi = unmi = 0)

as gL = 1/3, the nonlinear behavior due to the normal saturation could still be induced to

occur because of the presence of external ﬁelds, i.e., ude 6= 0. This is the reason why the

harmonics shown in Figs. 1-2 are nonzero at gL = 1/3.

From Figs. 1 and 2, we ﬁnd that the second-order harmonics of the Fr¨ohlich ﬁeld and

orientational magnetization are of three orders of magnitude larger than the corresponding

third-order harmonics. Thus, to monitor the structure transformation of ERMR solids, it is

more attractive to detect the second-order harmonics than the third-order.

Finally, we display the temperature eﬀect on the harmonics of the Fr¨ohlich ﬁeld and

orientational magnetization in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4, respectively. It is shown that decreasing

the temperature T causes all the harmonics to increase because of the change in the Fr¨ohlich

ﬁeld.

IV. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

Here some comments are in order. Based on a Langevin model, we have investigated the

nonlinear ac responses of ERMR solids which are subjected to a structural transformation.

In the present work, we have focused on the eﬀect of the magnetic ﬁelds on the nonlinear

ac responses. In fact, for the ERMR solid, the inﬂuence of electric ﬁelds can be investigated

as well. However, the present Langevin model is invalid for this purpose because there

is usually no permanent electric dipole moment inside the suspended particles, except for

ferroelectric particles. To one’s interest, when the particles own a nonlinear characteristic

inside them, the electric-ﬁeld eﬀect on the nonlinear ac responses can still be discussed,

based on the perturbation approach and self-consistent method [19] accompanying with an

eﬀective medium theory like the Maxwell-Garnett approximation.

In this paper, the Fr¨ohlich ﬁeld is actually an eﬀective ﬁeld, which is similar to the

Lorentz local ﬁeld. The latter is only deﬁned for induced dipole moments, while the former

is introduced to deal with permanent dipole moments.

The present consideration can be extended to ferroﬂuids, which are a suspension [28]

containing ferromagnetic particles embedded in a carrier liquid. However, the particles in

a ferroﬂuid possess a much smaller size than in the ERMR solid. Also, the particles can

form chains inside ferroﬂuids under the presence of a moderate magnetic ﬁeld, without the

need of a strong magnetic ﬁeld. For ERMR solids, a strong magnetic ﬁeld has to be used to

induce the formation of particle chains.

Finally, since the particles in ERMR solids are located very close, it is instructive to

take into account the eﬀect of multipolar interactions between the particles [29–31] on the

nonlinear ac responses.

To sum up, we have applied a Langevin model to investigate the nonlinear ac responses

of ERMR solids. For the longitudinal ﬁeld case, it has been shown that both even- and odd-

order harmonics are induced to occur. In contrast, only the odd-order harmonics appear

for the transverse ﬁeld case. Moreover, these harmonics can be aﬀected by the degree of

13

anisotropy of the ERMR solid, as well as the ﬁeld frequency. In particular, the second-order

harmonics are of several orders of magnitude larger than the corresponding third-order.

Thus, it is possible to real-time monitor the structural transformation of ERMR solids by

detecting the nonlinear ac reponses.

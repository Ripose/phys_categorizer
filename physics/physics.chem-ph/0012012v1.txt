Abstract

The quantum dynamics of coupled subsystems connected to a thermal bath
is studied. In some of the earlier work the eﬀect of intercenter coupling on the
dissipative part was neglected. This is equivalent to a zeroth-order perturba-
tive expansion of the damping term with respect to the intercenter coupling.
It is shown numerically for two coupled harmonic oscillators that this treat-
ment can lead to artifacts and a completely wrong description, for example,
of a charge transfer processes even for very weak intercenter coupling. Here
we perform a ﬁrst-order treatment and show that these artifacts disappear.
In addition, we demonstrate that the thermodynamic equilibrium population
is almost reached even for strong intercenter coupling strength.

I. INTRODUCTION

Quantum dynamics of complex molecules or molecules in a dissipative environment has
attracted a lot of attention during the last years. One special kind of this problem is the
electron transfer dynamics in or between molecules especially in solution [1–3]. The bath-
related relaxation can be described in a variety of ways. Among others these are the path
integral methods [4,5], the semi-group methods [6–8], and the reduced density matrix (RDM)
theory [9]. The latter one has been especially successful in Redﬁeld’s formulation [10, 11]
and is the topic of the present investigation. As usual, the master equation for the RDM is
derived from the equation of the full system, i.e. relevant system plus bath, by tracing out
the bath degrees of freedom. The main limitations of Redﬁeld theory are the second-order
perturbation treatment in system-bath coupling and the neglect of memory eﬀects (Markov
approximation). In addition Redﬁeld suggested the use of the secular approximation. In
this approximation it is assumed that every element of the RDM in eigenstate representation
(ER) is coupled only to those elements that oscillate at the same frequency. In the present
study we do not perform this additional approximation which could distort the correct time
evolution in transfer problems [12, 13].

To be rigorous in applying Redﬁeld theory, the operators describing the time evolution
have to be expressed in ER of the relevant system as has been done in the original papers
[10, 11]. For electron transfer this was performed in part of the literature (see for example
[14–17]) while in another part of the literature [18–23] diabatic (local) representations (DRs)
have been used, which signiﬁcantly reduces the numerical eﬀort in many cases. In NMR
literature [11, 24, 25] most people seem to use the ER while in quantum optics most people
use DRs [26, 27]. Only recently the ER is used in quantum optics [28–30]. Here we focus
on electron transfer systems, but the conclusions should also be applicable to problems in
other areas.

While in ER the damping term is evaluated exactly, in DR the inﬂuence of the coupling
between the local subsystems on dissipation is neglected. As a consequence the relaxation
terms do not lead to the proper thermal equilibrium of the coupled system [6, 31, 32]. Only
the thermal equilibrium of each separate subsystem is reached which can be quite diﬀerent
from the thermal equilibrium of the coupled system. It will be shown here that even for a
very small intercenter coupling a completely wrong asymptotic value can be obtained.

Although possibly leading to the wrong thermal equilibrium the local DR has advantages.
For large problems it may be diﬃcult to calculate the eigenstates of the system. These are
not necessary in the DR. There one only needs the eigenstates of the subsystems. The
quantum master equation can be implemented more eﬃciently in DR in many cases [18,33–
35]. Moreover, almost all physical and chemical properties of transfer systems are expressed
in the DR. For example, to determine the transfer rate one often calculates the population
of the diabatic states and obtains the rate from their time evolution. To do so one has to
switch back and forth between DR and ER all the time if the time evolution is determined
in ER.

Using the semi-group methodology and a simple model of two fermion sites, DR and
ER have been compared already [6]. We are interested in a more complicated system, i.e.
a curve-crossing problem. The fact that we use a diﬀerent relaxation mechanism should
eﬀect the ﬁndings only very little. Here we not only compare DR and ER but show how the

2

relaxation term in DR can be written more precisely for small intercenter coupling.

The paper is organized as follows. The next section gives an introduction to the Redﬁeld
theory and, using the DR, presents a zeroth-order (DR0) and a ﬁrst-order (DR1) pertur-
bation expansion in the intercenter coupling. In the third section numerical examples are
shown for two coupled harmonic oscillators. The DR and ER results are compared to each
other and also to the improved local relaxation term derived here. The last section gives a
short summary. Atomic units are used unless otherwise stated.

II. INTERCENTER PERTURBATION EXPANSION WITHIN THE REDFIELD
EQUATION

In the RDM theory the full system is divided into a relevant system part and a heat
bath. Therefore the total Hamiltonian consists of three terms – the system part HS, the
bath part HB, and the system-bath interaction HSB:

H = HS + HB + HSB.

The RDM ρ is obtained from the density matrix of the full system by tracing out the degrees
of freedom of the environment. This reduction together with a second-order perturbative
treatment of HSB and the Markov approximation leads to the Redﬁeld equation [9–11, 36]:

and V the coupling among them which is assumed to be small. Two canonical bases can be
constructed for such a Hamiltonian. One consists of eigenfunctions of H0. It is often called
a local basis because these basis functions of the diabatic potential energy surfaces (PESs)
are used below to
are located at speciﬁc subsystems (centers). Latin indices such as

it consists of eigenstates of HS and is called adiabatic basis. For these ER basis functions

we use Greek indices such as

III. ELECTRON TRANSFER IN A TWO-CENTER SYSTEM

In the following we direct our attention to electron transfer in an example system con-
sisting of two charge localization centers considered to be excited electronic states. The
PESs of the localization centers are assumed to be harmonic and are sketched in Fig. 1. For
this example the Hamiltonian of the uncoupled system is given by

In the DR0 expansion (12) the system can emit or absorb only at intra-subsystem transition
frequencies ωM N . The spectral density of the bath J(ω) is eﬀectively reduced to discrete
ωm). The advantage of this approach is the scaling behavior of
values J(ω) =
of basis functions which results from the simple structure
the CPU time with the number

of the Λ matrix (12). As shown numerically [34, 35] it scales like
3 scaling of the DR1 approximation (11). In DR1 the spectral density is probed

to be of Ohmic form with exponential cut-oﬀ

Here Θ denotes the step function and ωc the cut-oﬀ frequency.
In this study all system
oscillators have the same frequency ω1 (see Table I) and the cut-oﬀ frequency ωc is set equal
to ω1. The normalization prefactor η is determined such that the spectral densities in DR
and ER coincide at ω1. Eq. (18) together with Eq. (10) yields the full correlation function.
If the system Hamiltonian HS is diagonalized and the resulting ER basis is used to
calculate the elements of the operators in Eq. (4), there will be no longer any convenient
structure in K or Λ, so that the full matrix-matrix multiplications are inevitable. For this

treatment of the intercenter coupling. It is straightforward to obtain the matrices for ρ and

The pulse is chosen such that mainly the fourth and ﬁfth vibrational level of the ﬁrst (left)

For the case of propagating in ER the RDM is transformed back to the DR in order to apply
Eq. (20).

In the following we compare the population dynamics in the two-center electron transfer
system using three diﬀerent intercenter coupling strengths V and four diﬀerent conﬁgurations
of the two harmonic PESs. The diabatic PESs and eigenenergies are shown in Fig. 1.
Beginning our analysis with the weak coupling case v = v12 = v21 = 0.1ω1 it is expected
that a perturbation expansion in V yields almost exact results. This is the reasoning why
the DR0 term, which is easy to implement, has been used in earlier work [18–23].

In conﬁguration (a) the eigenenergies of the two diabatic PESs are in resonance. For
example, the ﬁrst vibrational eigenenergy of the ﬁrst center equals the third vibrational
eigenenergy of the second center. It is important to note that in this conﬁguration no vibra-
tional level of the ﬁrst center is below the crossing point of the two PESs. The calculations
using ER and DR0 as well as DR1 give almost identical results, see Fig. 2a. For long times
DR0 deviates a tiny bit. Redﬁeld theory in ER is known to give the correct long-time limit
(up to the Lamb shift).

Conﬁguration (b) diﬀers from the ﬁrst one by shifting the ﬁrst PES up by ω1/2. As
shown in Fig. 2b the ER and DR1 results again agree perfectly. On the other hand, the
DR0 results are a little bit oﬀ already at early times and the equilibrium value departs from
the correct value much more than in the ﬁrst, on-resonance conﬁguration.

6

Shifting the PESs further apart than in (a) yields conﬁguration (c). The energy levels
are again on-resonance but this time two vibrational levels of the ﬁrst center are below
the curve-crossing point, i.e. there is a barrier for low-energy parts of the wave packet. As
shown in Fig. 2c DR1 and the ER results agree perfectly once more. The DR0 results are
terribly oﬀ. The long-time population of the ﬁrst center which should vanish for the present
conﬁguration stays ﬁnite.

If we increase the energy of the ﬁrst PES by ω1/2 to obtain conﬁguration (d) DR0 fails

again while DR1 gives correct results in comparison to the ER, see Fig. 2d.

To understand the large diﬀerence between DR0 and DR1 we have a closer look at the
ﬁnal result for the matrix elements of Λ, Eqs. (11) and (12). The DR0 contribution (12) is
independent of the intercenter coupling V . The system part of the system-bath interaction
K allows only for relaxation within each center. So there is no mechanism in the dissipative
part which transfers population from one center to the other. This transfer has to be done by
the coherent part of the master equation. But the coherent part cannot transfer components
of the wave packet with energy below the crossing point of the PESs. As tunneling is mainly
suppressed, those components of the wave packet cannot leave their center anymore although
the corresponding PES might be quite high in energy. This results in the failure of DR0
for the conﬁgurations with barrier: Parts of the wave packet get trapped in the two lowest
levels of the left center. From Eq. (11) one can explain why in the on-resonance case the
DR0 results are in better agreement with the correct results. In this conﬁguration some of
the DR1 terms are very small and so the DR1 correction is smaller.

Now we discuss the medium coupling strength v = 0.5ω1 (see Fig. 3). The results for
conﬁgurations (a) and (b), i.e. without barrier, look quite similar. In both cases the ER
and DR1 results agree very well for short and long times. At intermediate times there is a
small diﬀerence. The DR0 results already deviate at short times and for long times there
is too much population in the left (higher) center. For conﬁgurations (c) and (d), i.e. with
barrier, again the ER and DR1 results coincide for small and long times. DR0 is oﬀ already
after rather short times and the long-time limit is again wrong.

For the strong coupling v = ω1 (see Fig. 4) the behavior of the results is quite similar to
the medium coupling. For conﬁgurations (a) and (b) the diﬀerence at intermediate times is
a little larger, so is the deviation of the long-time DR0 limit. For conﬁgurations (c) and (d)
with barrier there is also a discrepancy for DR1 already at short times and the correct long-
time limit is not reached exactly. But the disagreement is surprisingly small for the strong
coupling. Overall DR1 still looks quite reasonable while the DR0 results are completely oﬀ.

IV. SUMMARY

In addition to the approximations done in Redﬁeld theory, i.e. second-order perturbation
expansion in the system-bath coupling and Markov approximation, we have applied pertur-
bation theory in the intercenter coupling.
It has been shown for two coupled harmonic
surfaces that the zeroth-order approximation DR0 which is equivalent to the diabatic damp-
ing approximation [38] can yield wrong population dynamics even for very small intercenter
coupling. These artifacts disappear using the ﬁrst-order theory DR1.

The scaling of DR1 is like

2.3 for DR0. This is of course a serious drawback
of DR1. For conﬁgurations without barrier it seems to be possible to use DR0 for weak to

3 not as

medium intercenter coupling. This of course depends on the accuracy required especially
for the long-time limit.
In all other cases one should either use the exact ER or DR1.
Although the ﬁrst-order results are not exact for medium and strong intercenter coupling
these calculations have at least two advantages. First of all, one does not need to calculate
the eigenstates and energies of the full system Hamiltonian HS. For small systems like two
coupled harmonic surfaces using one reaction coordinate this calculation is of course easy.
But if one wants to study larger systems like molecular wires [6, 14] and/or multi-mode
models [22, 23, 33] this is no longer a trivial task. The second advantage is related to the
fact that in all transfer problems one is mainly interested in properties which are deﬁned in
a local basis, e. g. the population in each subsystem in any moment in time. If one uses the
ER one has always to transform back to the DR in order to calculate these properties. So
for large-scale problems using a DR together with the ﬁrst-order perturbation in V should
be advantageous.

In a sense the present study is an extension of the investigation performed by Davis
et al. [6]. They compared ER and DR for a two-site problem. Here we looked at a more
general multilevel system and also calculated the ﬁrst-order perturbation. In their model
they do not have a reaction coordinate and therefore no barrier. Their ﬁndings correspond
more to cases (a) and (b) in the previous section. Besides the agreement in the case of small
intercenter coupling they also found good agreement in the high-temperature limit. Using
our model this statement could not be conﬁrmed for a general conﬁguration, although there
might be conﬁgurations where it is true.

In Ref. [30] the authors followed a strategy diﬀerent from the present work. They also
studied two coupled harmonic oscillators modeling two coupled microcavities, but only one
cavity was coupled to the thermal bath directly. This should not eﬀect the questions studied
here. With a transformation to uncoupled oscillators they eﬀectively reduced the intercenter
coupling to zero. The result [30] is then exact for arbitrary V . The disadvantage of this
strategy is that it is not easy to extend to larger systems. The advantage of the presently
developed ﬁrst-order expansion in V is its general applicability to problems of any size.

FIG. 2. Time evolution for small intercenter coupling and for the four diﬀerent conﬁgurations.
The results in ER are shown by the solid line while the results in diabatic basis are shown by dotted
(zeroth-order) and dashed (ﬁrst-order) lines. The results for ER and DR1 are indistinguishable for
small intercenter coupling. Note the logarithmic time scale.

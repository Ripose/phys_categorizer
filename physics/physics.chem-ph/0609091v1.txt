The importance of ﬁnite-size eﬀects for the electronic structure of long zigzag and armchair
carbon nanotubes is studied. We analyze the electronic structure of capped (6,6), (8,0), and (9,0)
single walled carbon nanotubes as a function of their length up to 60 nm, using a divide and conquer
density functional theory approach. For the metallic nanotubes studied, most of the physical features
appearing in the density of states of an inﬁnite carbon nanotube are recovered at a length of 40 nm.
The (8,0) semi-conducting nanotube studied exhibits pronounced edge eﬀects within the energy gap
that scale as the inverse of the length of the nanotube. As a result, the energy gap reduces from the
value of ∼ 1 eV calculated for the periodic system to a value of ∼ 0.25 eV calculated for a capped
62 nm long CNT. These edge eﬀects are expected to become negligible only at tube lengths exceeding
6 µm. Our results indicate that careful tailoring of the nature of the system and its capping units
should be applied when designing new nanoelectronic devices based on carbon nanotubes. These
conclusions are expected to hold for other one-dimensional systems such as graphene nanoribbons,
conducting polymers, and DNA molecules.

Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been suggested as po-
tential candidates for replacing electronic components
and interconnects in future nanoelectronic devices.1 Ex-
periments have revealed the possibility of obtaining a
wide range of electronic behavior when studying these
systems, ranging from coherent transport2,3 suitable for
interconnects, to ﬁeld eﬀect switching capabilities4,5,6,7
needed for electronic components design. While earlier
conductance experiments2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 involved long seg-
ments of CNTs, new technologies allow for the fabri-
cation of ultrashort CNT junctions where reproducible
room temperature ballistic transport at the high bias
regime is observed.10,11 Nevertheless, the reduced length
of the CNT junctions, which is essential to suppress
electron-phonon scattering, introduces important physi-
cal phenomena such as quantum conﬁnement and edge ef-
fects. Several theoretical studies have emphasized the im-
portance of such eﬀects when considering the electronic
structure,12,13,14 electric transport,15,16,17,18,19 and mag-
netic20,21,22 properties of ﬁnite CNTs. These eﬀects are
expected to be manifested in experiments involving the
dielectric screening constants,23 optical excitations24 and
the Raman spectroscopy25 of such systems. Since it is
predicted that the physical characteristics of ﬁnite CNTs
are considerably diﬀerent from those of their inﬁnite
counterparts, it is essential to identify the limit at which
ﬁnite size eﬀects have to be taken into account in order
to properly describe their electronic properties.

Therefore, a fundamental question arises: Is there a
universal CNT length below which ﬁnite size eﬀects be-

this question. To this end, we present a novel density
functional theory (DFT) study of the electronic struc-
ture of CNTs as a function of their length, up to 62 nm.
Using a divide and conquer approach for ﬁrst-principles
electronic structure and transport calculations through
ﬁnite elongated systems,26 we study the ﬁnite size eﬀects
on the electronic structure of capped (6,6), (8,0), and
(9,0) CNTS. A careful comparison with the electronic

CNT is depicted on the right.

structure of inﬁnitely long periodic CNTs enables us to
determine the limit at which a ﬁnite CNT can be fairly
approximated by its inﬁnite periodic counterpart.

Our results show that for the metallic CNTs studied
herein, most of the physical features appearing in the
density of states (DOS) of the inﬁnite periodic system
are recovered at a length of 40 nm. A similar picture
arises for the semi-conducting CNT considered. How-
ever, a subtle diﬀerence exists. Pronounced features in
the DOS resulting from edge eﬀects appear at the vicin-
ity of the Fermi energy, thus substantially inﬂuencing
the electronic character of the CNT. These features are
expected to abide up to CNTs lengths of 60 µm, much
longer than previously predicted.16

The relaxed structures of the CNTs employed in this
study are presented in Fig. 1. These conﬁgurations have

alized gradient approximation of density functional the-
ory as implemented in the Gaussian suite of programs.31.
The DOS calculations has been carried out using the fol-
lowing relation:

ℑ{T r[Gr(E)S]},

where, S is the overlap matrix, Gr(E) = [ǫS − H]−1 is
the retarded Green’s function (GF), ǫ = E + iη, E is
the energy, H is the Hamiltonian matrix, and η → 0+ is
a small imaginary part introduced in order to shift the
poles of the GF from the real axis. The Hamiltonian
matrix is calculated using a divide and conquer DFT ap-
proach.26 Within this approach H is represented by a
block tridiagonal matrix, where the ﬁrst and last diag-
onal blocks correspond to the two capping ends of the
CNT. The remaining diagonal blocks correspond to the
central part of the CNT which is composed of a replicated
unit cell. The two capping ends and the replicated central
part unit cell are chosen to be long enough such that the
block-tridiagonal representation of H (and S) is valid.
All the electronic structure calculations are performed
using the screened exchange hybrid functional of Heyd,
Scuseria, and Ernzerhof32, that was found to provide a
good description of the single-particle band energies of

2

both semi-conducting33 and metallic34 CNTs. The cap-
ping end diagonal Hamiltonian blocks and their coupling
to the central part are evaluated via a molecular calcula-
tion involving the two capping ends and one unit cell cut
out of the central part. We approximate the central part
replicated unit cell blocks and the coupling between two
such adjacent blocks to be constant along the CNT and
extract them from a periodic boundary condition35 cal-
culation. The resulting block-tridiagonal matrix (ǫS −H)
is then partially inverted, using an eﬃcient algorithm,36
to obtain the relevant GF blocks needed for the DOS
calculation. For a detailed description of our divide and
conquer approach see Ref.[26].

In Fig. 2 we present the DOS of the (6,6) metallic CNT
at an energy range of ±5 eV around the Fermi energy of
the inﬁnite system for several tube lengths. Qualitatively,
it can be seen that for a 6.2 nm CNT (upper panel) the
DOS is composed of a set of irregularly spaced energy
levels and is totally uncorrelated with the DOS of the in-
ﬁnite CNT (lower panel). As the length of the CNT is in-
creased the agreement between the DOS of the ﬁnite and
the periodic systems increases. At a length of 21 nm one
can clearly see the buildup of the Van-Hove singularities
and the constant DOS at the vicinity of the Fermi en-
ergy. When the length of the CNT exceeds 40 nm, ﬁnite
size eﬀects become negligible and most of the physical
features appearing in the DOS of the inﬁnite system are
recovered. A similar behavior is obtained for the DOS of
the metallic (9,0) CNT (not shown).

In order to quantify these results we apply a linear
cross-correlation analysis utilizing Pearson’s formula.37
In short, given two discrete data sets Xi and Yi, where
0 ≤ i ≤ M one can calculate their cross-correlation as
follows:

Here r is Pearson’s cross-correlation factor, ¯X is the mean
value of the Xi data set, and ¯Y is the mean value of
the Yi data set. The cross-correlation factor of Eq. 2 is
normalized such that −1 ≤ r ≤ 1. When r = 1 the two
sets are completely correlated, when r = −1 one set is
completely correlated with the inverse of the other set,
and when r = 0 there is no signiﬁcant correlation between
the two sets.

In Fig. 3 we show the calculated cross-correlation fac-
tor between the DOS of the ﬁnite CNTs and that of the
inﬁnite counterparts as a function of the tubes lengths.
For the shortest CNTs studied, the calculated Pearson’s
factor indicates no correlation of the DOS to that of the
periodic system. As discussed above, when the length
of the CNT is increased, the electronic structure of the
inﬁnite system is recovered. This translates to an asymp-
totic Pearson’s factor value of r = 1.

A natural question is: At what length can an inﬁnite
metallic CNT be used in order to represent the electronic
structure of its ﬁnite counterpart? The answer to this

question depends, of course, on the speciﬁc type of metal-
lic CNT and on the nature of the electronic properties
considered. For metallic CNTs one can identify (at least)
two important features in the DOS, namely the Van-Hove
singularities, which are manifested as characteristic sig-
natures in the optical spectra of CNTs, and the ﬁnite
DOS at the vicinity of the Fermi energy which accounts
for the metallic character of the CNT. From a careful
analysis of the DOS plots we ﬁnd that the Van-Hove sin-
gularities are fairly recovered at a length of ∼ 35 nm for
both metallic CNTs considered. The buildup of a ﬁnite
DOS at the vicinity of the Fermi energy is achieved at a
slightly larger length of ∼ 45 nm. This is also reﬂected
in the computed Pearson’s cross-correlation factor that
is as high as r = 0.98 at these CNTs lengths (see Fig. 3).
We now turn to discuss the semi-conducting CNT.
Similar to the metallic case, we consider the Van-Hove
singularities and the energy band gap (Eg) as two im-
portant characteristic features of the its DOS. The recon-
struction of the Van-Hove singularities as the length of
the ﬁnite semi-conducting CNT is increased, follows the
same lines described above for the metallic case. Never-
theless, a subtle diﬀerence exists. In Fig. 4 the DOS of
the ﬁnite (8,0) capped CNT is presented for several CNT
lengths at a region of ±0.75 eV around the Fermi energy
of the inﬁnite periodic system. While Eg of an inﬁnite pe-
riodic (8,0) CNT is calculated to be 1 eV (lower panel of
Fig. 4), even for the longest CNT considered (∼ 62 nm), a
noticeable DOS pattern clearly appears within the energy
gap region, thus reducing the eﬀective gap to a consid-
erably lower value of 0.25 eV. These states are identiﬁed
as edge eﬀects which originate from the capping units
of the ﬁnite CNT. Their appearance also translates to a
slower approach of the cross-correlation factor towards
its asymptotic value, as can be seen in Fig. 3.

FIG. 4: Density of states of a capped (8,0) CNT calculated
for several tube lengths and compared to the DOS of the
inﬁnite periodic system (lower panel). The energy axis origin
of all the panels is set to the Fermi energy of the inﬁnite CNT
(−4.53 eV)

At this point, it should be mentioned that in order to
obtain the DOS diagrams we have artiﬁcially broadened
the energy levels by a value of 1 × 10−2 eV. In an exper-
imental setup this may correspond to broadening due to
electron-phonon coupling, surface/contacts eﬀects, and
ﬁnite temperature eﬀects. In order for the edge eﬀects
to become negligible it is desired that their peak DOS
value would be considerably smaller than the height of
the broadened Van-Hove singularities corresponding to
the top of the valence band and the bottom of the con-
duction band. The height of the edge-related peaks scales
roughly as ∼ 1/L, where L is the length of the ﬁnite CNT.
For the broadening value mentioned above, a CNT length
of ∼ 6 µm is needed for the peaks to become less than
1% in height with respect to the van-Hove singularity ap-
pearing at the bottom of the conduction band (located
∼ 0.5 eV above the Fermi energy). This value is much
larger than the typical CNT length used in many exper-
imental setups, which implies that the inclusion of quan-
tum conﬁnement and edge eﬀects can become crucial for
the appropriate interpretation of experimental results. It
should be noted that the nature of the edge-related DOS
peaks appearing within the energy gap depends on the
characteristics of the capping units. Other systems with
diﬀerent capping units may exhibit diﬀerent features.

Edge eﬀects play a dominant role when considering
the electronic and magnetic character of low dimen-
sional elongated systems. This has been shown for
systems such as graphene nanoribbons,38,39,40,41 carbon
nanotubes,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22 and other related
structures.42 When considering the study of carbon nan-
otubes as candidates for future nano-electronic devices,
it is important to identify the contribution of ﬁnite size
eﬀects to the physical properties of the entire system. In
the present letter, we have shown that the limit at which
ﬁnite-size eﬀects become negligible, highly depends on
the system under consideration, the capping units, and
the physical property of interest. This has been done by
studying the DOS of CNTs as a function of their length
and comparing with that of the periodic system. Our re-
sults suggest that for the metallic systems studied, a CNT
segment of, at least, 40 − 60nm has to be considered if
edge eﬀects are to be neglected. For the semi-conducting
CNT studied here, prominent edge eﬀects are expected
to dominate up to lengths as high as a few microme-

ters. Even though the exact details of such eﬀects are
expected to depend on the nature of the capping units,
care should be taken regarding their inﬂuence on the elec-
tronic character of the system. Our conclusions should
hold for other ﬁnite elongated systems such as graphene
nanoribbons, conducting polymers, and DNA molecules,
as well. More research along these lines is currently in
progress.

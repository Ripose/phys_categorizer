Abstract

We present a quantum mechanical study of the diatomic hydro-
gen H(2S) and oxygen O(3P ) collision and energy transfer for its four
molecular symmetry (X 2Π,2 Σ−,4 Π,4 Σ−), which is important for the
investigation of many processes of astrophysical and chemical inter-
ests including the one on molecular cooling, trapping or Bose-Einstein
condensation. We compute the rovibrational spectra for the (X 2Π)
state and the resulting bound states are in an excellent agreement
with experimental data for the energy range lower than the dissoci-
ation threshold. We calculate the phase shifts of its partial-waves,
the total cross section, and the diﬀerential cross section. They are all
well-structured because of the shape of its potential curve. We do the
similar studies for the other three dissociative states (2Σ−,4 Π,4 Σ−).
Finally, we have also decided the thermal rate coeﬃcients for the hy-
drogen and oxygen collision for its four individual states.

1 Introduction

The atom and atom collisions are the simplest nevertheless among the most

important systems for quantum molecular scattering investigation. On one

hand, they serve as a prototype for the understanding of quantum scattering

process because they are the only real molecular systems at present time

that a complete picture of the diﬀerent aspects of the quantum scattering

can been seen from a computational simulation, and that a strict test with

the experimental observations can be made [1, 2]. On the other hand, good

understanding and accurate calculation of related quantities for the diatomic

scattering are essential to the exploration of many other important ﬁelds.

This includes the study of laser cooling, magnetic trapping and Bose-Einstein

condensation of molecules [3, 4]. To these ends, we have chosen the system

of oxygen-hydrogen collision for our present study,

O∗ + H → O + H ∗.

(1)

On the practical or application side, this reaction constitutes the basic or

primary step for many complicated processes for combustion, chemical reac-

tions, and atmospheric or astrophysical sources [5-30]. For example, it is one

of the main reactions occurring in the nonthermal escape of the hydrogen
from Venus and Mars, where O∗ is produced due to the dissociative recombi-
nation of O+

2 in the Martian atmosphere [8, 16, 18, 26]. Another example is

that the collisional hydrogen and oxygen has been investigated to illustrate

the use of infrared laser pulses to manipulate the collision pairs [19, 20].

In this paper, our object is to present a relatively detailed and systematic

study of the collision for the system (1).

In Section 2, we ﬁrst show the

2

potential energy curves of the ﬁrst four states of the collision (1) and decide

the bound states for the ground state due to the existence of an attractive

potential well. We then present the fundamental theory for the investigation

of their quantum scattering process. In Section 3, we demonstrate the vari-

ous aspects of the scattering processes. We ﬁrst show the behavior of most

fundamental quantity - phase shift - for the quantum scattering and study its

variation in terms of the partial waves or collision energy. We then calculate

the total cross sections and the diﬀerential cross sections and study their

relations with the change of energies or scattering angles. We also compute

the thermal rate coeﬃcients which is the average of the reactive ﬂux over

the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. The ﬁnal Section contains a discussion

and summary.

2 Potential Energy Curves and Scattering The-

2.1 Potential energy curves

We ﬁrst present the potential energy curves for the collisional O(3P ) + H(2S)

system. It is well-known that the dynamic features, especially the resonance,

is decided by or even sensible to the details of the shape for the curves [31].

In addition, the previous calculations
[16, 18, 26] for the excited states
(2Σ−, 4Π, and 4Σ−) use the potential data which are approaching the asymp-

totic region in the positive direction which is in violation of the physical law

of an attractive dispersion force at a large distance [5, 6, 7, 8, 23]. There-

3

fore, we decide to use the one from the calculation of Yarkony without an

inclusion of any ﬁne-structure corrections such as the spin-orbit interaction

[15, 25]. We do the analytical ﬁtting and require that the asymptotical po-

tentials satisfying the negative or inverse 6th-power of internuclear distance.
Figure 1 displays the ﬁrst four states (X 2Π,2 Σ−,4 Π,4 Σ−) of the system (1)
with the energy zero chosen to be at the asymptotes. The curve for the X 2Π

state is the typical one of a ground state for a diatomic molecule, featuring

an attractive potential well at a stable conﬁguration. The other three are

the usual repulsive potentials seen for the excited states.

The molecular spectra of the OH system is still of fundamental inter-

est [32, 33]. In addition to the continuing investigation of its whole range

of the spectra, the OH maser is considered to be a means for detecting the

interaction between the supernova remnant and molecular cloud which is im-

portant for understanding the formation processes of new stars [34, 35, 36].

For the ground state (X 2Π) potential energy curve, we have determined the

bound states associated with the attractive potential energy well for the en-

ergy below the dissociation threshold. We do the calculation by utilization

of the LEV EL 7.5 program [37]. The Hamiltonian includes the standard

contributions for a diatomic molecule. The resulting rovibrational energy

levels constitute a banded structure with each vibrational quantum number

n associated with a bunch of rotational sublevels {j}. The table 1 shows the

computed results for vibrational quantum number up to 16 and when the j

equal to 0 or 1. When compared to the experimental observation [32, 33],

they have an excellent agreement except for the states near the dissociation

threshold where we expect a big derivation from the behaviors for the ideal

4

models.

2.2 Scattering Theory

We employ the usual approach of partial wave expansion to study the atom-

atom collisions where both the incident and the scattered waves are analyzed

in terms of the components of spherical waves [1, 2]. Since only the phase

shifts δl of the outgoing partial waves are changed, they are the central quan-

tity that need to be calculated. They contain all the dynamic information for

the scattering process. The phase shifts are determined by the requirement

that the inside and outside scattering waves and their derivatives are contin-

uous at the boundary point R where the interaction potential V (r) between

two atoms vanishes. They are given by the formula

tan δl =

u(R)k ˜jl

where

and ˜jl or ˜nl are the Ricatti-Bessel or Ricatti-Neumann functions. The func-

tion u(R) is the radial scattering wave obtained by numerically solving the

radial Schr¨odinger equation from R = 0 for the given central potential. Once

the phase shifts are known, the diﬀerential or the total cross sections, for

instance, can be easily calculated as follows

3 Calculation Results

3.1 Partial wave analysis

We ﬁrst do the partial wave analysis of the ground state (X 2Π) for the O +H

collisional system. Figure 2 illustrates the variation of the calculated phase

shifts for the s and p waves in terms of the total collision energy. We observe

the expected phase change when the angular momentum quantum number

changes by one unit. For the energies computed, there are many partial

phases contributing to the total cross section for the scattering process. In

addition, they have the trend for approaching the zero when seen from the

lower energy side.

For the excited states, the partial wave analysis can be carried out in the

same way. Figure 3 is related to the change of the s and p waves in terms
of the collision energy for the 4Σ− state. We notice the similar behaviors to
those for the X 2Π state.

3.2 Total and diﬀerential cross sections

Figure 4 depicts the total cross sections for the four electronic states of the

hydrogen (2S) and oxygen (3P ) collisional system with diﬀerent symmetries.

The energy range is from 0.27 eV to 15 eV . As expected, they are a decreas-

ing function of the total energy except at the points where resonance occurs

6

for the ground state. It is due to the existence of a potential well for this
state (X 2Π). In addition, the magnitude of the total cross section for the
X 2Π state is signiﬁcant larger than those for the other three repulsive states.

The latter states show the similar behaviors.

We also compute the diﬀerential cross sections for the collision (1) with

diﬀerent orientations, which is a key quantity, for instance, for the study

of escaping issues of hydrogen and deuterium in the planetary exosphere.

Figures 5 displays the calculated results for the X 2Π state for the energy

equal to 0.2 eV or 3.0 eV , respectively. We see that for the low energy there

is a very large probability for forward scattering (θ = 0) and also a noticeable

amount for the head-on collision (θ = π). When energy increases, however,

the chance for the forward scattering persists but the one for the head-on

collision diminishes. The other states have the similar situations but they

have no probability for head-on collision for any values of energies. This is

shown in Figure 6.

3.3 Reaction rate coeﬃcients

The thermal reaction rate coeﬃcients at temperature T are deﬁned as follows

[38, 39, 40]

k(T ) =< vσ >=

(βE) e−βEσ(E)d (βE) ,

which are the Maxwell-Boltzman average over the reactive ﬂux. The reactive

8

ﬂux is the relative velocity v for the collision times the total cross section σ

calculated before. The E is the relative translation energy for the diatomic
system given by E = 1
2µv2, and the β is the inverse of the Boltzman con-
stant kB times the absolute temperature T . The calculated temperature

7

dependence of the reaction rate coeﬃcient for the 4Π state is demonstrated

in Figure 7. The temperature range chosen is of planetary interest. We see

that the calculated result shows an increasing function of the temperature.

The other states have the similar behavior.

4 Discussions and Summary

We have decided the bound states associated with the existence of an attrac-
tive potential well for the ground state (X 2Π). The computed rovibrational

energy levels are in an excellent accord with the experimental data for the

lower energy range. However, when the energy increases up to the direction

of the dissociation threshold, the diﬀerence is accumulating and becoming

very large. This indicates that the standard models for treating the rovibra-

tional motion of diatomic molecules are no longer valid for the higher energy

range.

The phase shifts are the most fundamental quantity which we have com-

puted for the scattering system (1). They shows the expected behaviors in

terms of the variation of the angular momentum or the total collision energy.

Our calculated total cross sections for the four individual states are similar

to the ones obtained by one of the authors [8], and also in the similar range

of the magnitudes to some other calculations as shown in the references [16]

and [26]. However, there are still some signiﬁcant diﬀerences when compared

to all these previous study. For example, the new total cross section for

the ground states is signiﬁcantly separated from all other three dissociation

states. In the meantime, the dissociation states all have the similar magni-

8

tudes in the total cross section. These should be more reasonable results.

The calculated diﬀerential cross sections as demonstrated in Figures 5

and 6 yield some useful information. For instance, for the ground state and

with a smaller total energy, the forward scattering is a preferential one with

some probability of backward scattering. When energy increases, however,

the collision becomes exclusively forward and there is no chance for the head-

on collision. This is consistent with the picture of the potential energy curve

for the ground state. The existence of the potential energy well results in

the quantum mechanical interference eﬀect and therefore the splitting of the

particle wave. With an increasing total energy or larger impact parameter,

a classical description becomes valid for the the collision. Nevertheless, in

contrast to the one for the ground state, the other three dissociative states

have a dominate forward scattering. The diatomic system collides classically

and transfers the energy to each other. This is also in accord with the shape

of the potential curves as well as an isotropic diatomic interaction.

Finally, we have determined the rate coeﬃcients for the four individual
states of the collisional hydrogen (2S) and oxygen (3P ) system. They are all

the increasing function of the temperature.

In conclusion, the collisional hydrogen (2S) and oxygen (3P ) complex is

one of the simplest diatomic systems with many important and practical ap-

plications. From the investigation presented in this paper, we have gained

a better understanding of its scattering processes. Furthermore, our compu-

tation has demonstrated how signiﬁcant the shape of the potential energy

curves is in determining the dynamic features of a molecular system. The

range of energies being studied is also an important consideration. Therefore,

9

a dynamic theory or approach, incorporating quantum and classical mechan-

ics transition, will be a powerful tool in the study of molecular dynamics for

large systems.

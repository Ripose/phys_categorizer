Abstract

The HO−(aq) ion participates in myriad aqueous phase chemical processes of bio-
logical and chemical interest. A molecularly valid description of its hydration state,
currently poorly understood, is a natural prerequisite to modeling chemical transfor-
mations involving HO−(aq). Here it is shown that the statistical mechanical quasi-
chemical theory of solutions predicts that HO · [H2O]3
− is the dominant inner shell
coordination structure for HO−(aq) under standard conditions. Experimental ob-
servations and other theoretical calculations are adduced to support this conclusion.
Hydration free energies of neutral combinations of simple cations with HO−(aq) are
evaluated and agree well with experimental values.

1 Introduction

In this Letter, we consider the hydration state of HO−(aq) from the perspec-
tive of the quasi-chemical theory[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]. Then we draw upon earlier
calculations on H+(aq) [10], Li+(aq) [4,11], and Na+(aq) [12] and demonstrate
that the predicted hydration state provides a satisfactory description of the
pair hydration free energies for HOH, LiOH, and NaOH. The involvement of
HO−(aq) in the speciation of Be2+(aq) has been studied recently by the same
methods [13].

The H+(aq) and HO−(aq) ions are undoubtedly the most important ions in
aqueous phase chemistry, and particularly biological chemistry. This is due

largely to the fact that they are intrinsic to the aqueous media and common
extrinsic occupants of those phases encounter these species.

The Be2+(aq) example noted above provides a speciﬁc motivation for the
present work. Beryllium is an technologically important metal, but inhaled
beryllium dust is toxic and causes chronic beryllium disease in a subset of ex-
posed individuals. This disease eventually leads to lung failure and is presently
incurable. It is well-established that the HO− ions can cross-link Be2+ ions [14].
These colloidal beryllium-hydroxide clusters might ultimately trigger chronic
beryllium disease.

Understanding the hydration state of HO−(aq) is also a key to understand-
ing its anomalously high diﬀusivity [15,16,17]. Indeed both H+ and HO− are
thought to diﬀuse by a proton/hole-hopping mechanism, and this has impli-
cations that extend from biological transport of these ions to the transport
mechanisms in the polyelectrolyte membranes [18] involved in some fuel cell
designs.

2 Quasi-chemical Theory

In the quasi-chemical approach [8], the region around the solute of interest is
partitioned into inner and outer shell domains. For the case of HO−, the inner
shell comprises the water molecules directly coordinated with the ion. This
domain can be treated treated quantum mechanically, while the outer shell
contributions can be assessed using classical force-ﬁelds or dielectric continuum
models. The theory permits a variational check of the inner-outer partition
[12], but this aspect has not been pursued here. In the present study outer
shell contributions have been evaluated with a dielectric continuum model
and the trends conﬁrmed by molecular dynamics calculations using classical
interatomic potentials.

The inner shell reactions are:

HO− + n H2O ⇋ HO[H2O]n

−

(1)

The free energy change for these reactions were calculated using the Gaussian
programs [19]. The HO · [H2O]n
− (n = 0. . .4) clusters were geometry optimized
in the gas phase using the B3LYP hybrid density functional[20] and the 6-
31+G(d,p) basis set. Frequency calculations conﬁrmed a true minimum, and
the zero point energies were computed at the same level of theory. Single point
energies were calculated with the 6-311+G(2d,p) and the aug-cc-pVTZ basis
sets, although most of our results pertain to the former basis.

2

For estimating the outer shell contribution, the ChelpG method [21] was used
to obtain partial atomic charges. Then with the radii set developed by Ste-
fanovich et al.[22], surface tessera were generated [23], and the hydration free
energies of the clusters were calculated using a dielectric continuum model [24].
With this information and the binding free energies for the chemical reactions,
a primitive quasi-chemical approximation to the excess chemical potential of
HO−(aq) in water is:

n is the equilibrium con-
stant for the reaction Eq. 1 in an ideal gas state, n is the hydration number
of the most probable inner shell cluster, and β = 1/kBT. The density fac-
tor ρH2O appearing in EQ. 2 reﬂects the actual density of liquid water and
its eﬀect is included by a replacement contribution of −nkBT ln(ρH2O/ρ0) =
−nkBT ln(1354), where ρH2O = 1 gm/cm3 and ρ0 = 1 atm/RT . (A detailed
discussion on standard states and this replacement contribution can be found
in Grabowski et al. [10].) Note EQ. 2 is a simpliﬁcation of the broader the-
ory, and approximations enter at that stage. But all these approximations are
available for scrutiny and improvement [10].

In Table 1 the relevant energies are collected, and Fig. 1 gives the hydra-
tion free energy of the hydroxide anion for various hydration states. In or-
der of decreasing stability HO · [H2O]3
− >
HO · [H2O]4
− is independent
of the level of theory; calculations with the much larger aug-cc-pVTZ basis
give the same trends. Clearly (Fig. 1) including the HO · [H2O]4
− contribu-
tion to the sum does not appreciably alter the ﬁnal excess chemical potential
of HO−(aq): the whole eﬀect is due accurately to the HO · [H2O]3
− quasi-
component.

− ∼ HO · [H2O]1

− > HO · [H2O]2

A comparative rationalization of the electronic structure results on HO · [H2O]3
and HO · [H2O]4
− is the following: The nominal hydroxide hydrogen atom in
these negative ions is less positively charged than is typical of water hydrogens.
As a result, opportunities for hydrogen bond donation to that nominal hy-
droxide hydrogen have diminished proﬁtability. The fourth water ligand then
prefers to crowd among the other three on the oxygen side of the hydroxide
anion.

To assess the inﬂuence of the level of theory used, we have calculated the free
energy change for the reaction:

mizations at those levels. MP2 single point calculations have been performed
on the B3LYP derived geometries as well. An important feature that emerges
from Fig. 1 and Table 2 is that outer shell contribution favors HO · [H2O]3
−,
at all levels of theory, principally by providing an assessment of the hydration
of the separated ligands.

− and HO · [H2O]4

To check limitations of the dielectric continuum model for outer shell contri-
butions, the charging free energies of HO · [H2O]3
− were ob-
tained using classical molecular dynamics with TIP3P potential for water and
the TIP3P van der Waals parameters for the oxygen and hydrogen atoms of
− = −6.9 kcal/mol
the quasi-component. We ﬁnd that µex
in reasonable agreement with the −6 kcal/mol found using a dielectric model.
Importantly, the trend is unaltered. (See [25] for details on the classical simu-
lation procedure.) Positive outer shell packing contributions are not addressed
here, but these are expected to be slightly larger for HO · [H2O]4
− than for
HO · [H2O]3
− and hence should enhance the calculated diﬀerence.

3 Discussions

Fig. 1 and Table 2 show that contributions for inner shell water additions
to HO · [H2O]3
− are in fact favorable; this is routinely observed [11] and im-
plies that ligand hydration typically plays a signﬁcant role in establishing the
probable coordination numbers.

Another common observation in applying a quasi-chemical approach to ion
hydration problems is that aggregates beyond the most probable size begin to

5

ﬁnd favorable outer shell placements for the later additions. This seems to be
the case in the present problem too. Alternative arrangements of four water
molecules, such as HO · [H2O]3 · [H2O]−, are more favorable than HO · [H2O]4
−
by about 2 kcal/mole (Table 3 ). Numerous such arrangments are possible [26].
In the speciﬁc case we have considered, the fourth water molecule hydrogen-
bonds with the inner shell water molecules, similar to structure OHW4III in
Fig. 2 of [26].

Table 3 shows that the present inner shell computations are in reasonable
agreement with experimental results. They are also in reasonable agreement
with theoretical calculations reported in [26] with the diﬀerences attributable
to diﬀerences in the basis sets for minimization and energy evaluations. Note
that within the primitive quasi-chemical approach, outer-shell structures of
the fourth water are excluded here because they are accounted for in outer
shell contributions. Those arrangements are in fact part of the outer-sphere
arrangements of the HO · [H2O]3
− quasi-component. For the n=4 case, one
expects many isomers to be present, but thermochemical measurements ob-
viously cannot specify the structure. The trends (Table 3) strongly suggest
that in the gas-phase the n=4 cluster in fact must involve an outer-sphere
arrangement of the fourth water. This shell-closure at n=3 was inferred by
Moet-Ner and Speller [27] based on their thermochemical analysis of the step-
wise attachment of water to HO−. These authors also noted possible artifacts
in a much earlier work [28] that did not show the shell eﬀect.

The lower energy of the outer shell arrangement of the fourth water was re-
cently conﬁrmed spectroscopically by Johnson and coworkers [29]. Those ex-
periments showed that shell closure by the ligating water molecules occurs
when three water molecules are hydrogen bonded to the HO− ion. New spec-

HOH was obtained based on the experimental gas phase free energy of dissociation

energy of water (-6.3 kcal/mole) obtained from phase-equilibria information. The

tral features appeared with the addition of a fourth water molecule. These
new features were a result of hydrogen bonding of the fourth water molecule
to ﬁrst solvation shell waters instead of direct coordination with HO−.

The conclusion that HO · [H2O]3
− is the predominant inner shell hydration
number in liquid water under standard conditions has been supported by ab
initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations [17,30,31]. But thermodynamic
tests can be considered too. Earlier quasi-chemical studies have conﬁrmed the
dominant coordination structure of H+, Li+ and Na+ [25,10]. The dominant
coordination structure of Li+ and Na+ were also cross-checked against Born-
Oppenheimer AIMD [11,12]. Thus we can compute the hydration free energy
for the neutral ion combinations HOH, LiOH, and NaOH. These pair hydration
free energies, obtained using classical molecular dynamics simulations for the
outer shell contributions, are given in Table 4 (after Table III in [25]). The
dominant HO · [H2O]3
− structure was also found to be the best descriptor for
the ionization of water [25] and of Be[H2O]4

2+ [13].

The agreement shown in Table 4 is excellent. The minor discrepancies are
attributable to neglect of a variety of secondary eﬀects: anharmonicity of the
quasi-component structures, packing eﬀects, and dispersion interactions. An
assumption that HO · [H2O]4
− was the dominant form would have predicted
these hydration free energies to be signiﬁcantly more positive than the exper-
imental results.

4 Conclusions

The present quasi-chemical theory applied to HO−(aq) leads to the con-
clusion that HO · [H2O]3
− is the dominant inner shell coordination struc-

7

ture for the HO−(aq) ion in liquid water under standard conditions. The
− is less favorable by nearly 7 kcal/mole (≈ 12 kBT). The pre-
HO · [H2O]4
diction of HO · [H2O]3
− as the dominant form has been successfully used in
predicting the hydration free energies of neutral ion combinations HOH, LiOH,
and NaOH. Thus based on diﬀerent lines of investigation, we conclude that
HO− is predominantly HO · [H2O]3

− in liquid water.

Abstract

Anharmonic force ﬁelds and vibrational spectra of the azabenzene series (pyridine, pyridazine,

pyrimidine, pyrazine, s-triazine, 1,2,3-triazine, 1,2,4-triazine and s-tetrazine) and benzene are

obtained using density functional theory (DFT) with the B97-1 exchange-correlation functional

and a triple-zeta plus double polarization (TZ2P) basis set. Overall, the fundamental frequencies

computed by second-order rovibrational perturbation theory are in excellent agreement with

experiment. The resolution of the presently calculated anharmonic spectra is such that they

represent an extremely useful tool for the assignment and interpretation of the experimental

spectra, especially where resonances are involved.

INTRODUCTION

For atomization energies and geometries, density functional theory (DFT) constitutes

a cost-eﬀective alternative to wavefunction-based ab initio methods, being capable of

accuracies on the order of a few kcal/mol and a few picometer, respectively, if basis sets

of polarized triple zeta quality are employed[1, 2].

As a result of this astonishing success, especially considering the modest computational

cost of DFT methods, a variety of new applications are now being explored[3, 4, 5, 6, 7],

including, very recently, the calculation of molecular anharmonic potential energy surfaces

[8]. Anharmonic potential energy surfaces (see Refs.[9, 10] for initial pioneering studies at

the SCF and CISD level) allow for the prediction of molecular vibration-rotation spectra

that can be compared directly to experiment, obviating the need to make estimations or

approximations for the eﬀect of anharmonicity. CCSD(T)/spdf anharmonic force ﬁelds can

achieve accuracies on the order of 10 cm−

1 or better for fundamentals (e.g. [11] and references

therein), and even greater accuracy is achievable if still larger basis sets and corrections for

inner-shell correlation are considered[12, 13].

DFT anharmonic force ﬁelds for small molecules have recently been the subject of two

validation studies[14, 15]. Our own validation study[15] suggested that, for fundamental

frequencies, an RMS accuracy of about 18 cm−

1 can be attained when using the B97-1

functional with suﬃciently large basis sets. The question arises as to how capable DFT is to

treat medium-sized organic molecules in this fashion. Particularly relevant here is the study

the study of Miani et al.[16] on the fundamental frequencies of benzene, which employed

the B3LYP[17, 18] functional with the TZ2P (triple-zeta plus double polarization) basis set.

This paper, as well as a more recent study of furan, pyrrole and thiophene[19], in fact yielded

even more accurate results on these medium-sized organic systems than suggested by the

small-molecule validation studies cited above.

The azabenzenes are obtained by systematically replacing CH moieties in benzene by

nitrogen atoms.

Numerous experimental spectra of these compounds are available

in the literature, ranging from mono-azabenzene (pyridine) to 1,2,4,5-tetraazabenzene

(s-tetrazine).

Pentazine is quite elusive[20];

the equally elusive N6

(hexazine or

hexaazabenzene) molecule has been the subject of extensive theoretical studies[21, 22]: at

the CCSD(T)/cc-pVTZ level, the hexazine (hexaazabenzene) structure undergoes distortion

2

from the idealized D6h ring to a D2 geometry, which is a local minimum situated some 23

kcal/mol above the C2h diazide global minimum[22]. Straka recently made the interesting
suggestion that cyclic N6 may form very stable M(η6-N6) complexes with M=Ti, Zr, Hf,

In practice, nine molecules are relevant to the present study:

the parent benzene

molecule, pyridine, pyridazine, pyrimidine, pyrazine, 1,2,3-triazine, 1,2,4-triazine, 1,2,5-

triazine (sym-triazine) and 1,2,4,5-tetrazine (s-tetrazine). All molecules are displayed in

Th[23].

Azabenzene skeletons serve as building blocks in nature, e.g., pyridine in pyridixol (vitamin

B6), pyridazine and pyrimidine in pteridine, itself found in folic acid (vitamin vitamin B10)

and riboﬂavin (vitamin B2). Moreover the four DNA bases are derivates of pyrimidine

(C, T) and of purine (A, G) — itself a pyrimidine-imidazole fused ring system. For these

reasons, azabenzene-like compounds ﬁgure in drug design, e.g.

the reverse transcriptase

inhibitors AZT (contains pyrimidine) or nevirapine (contains pyridine). Derivatives of

pyridazine have been found to have potential therapeutic or plant growth inhibitory eﬀects.

Quite diﬀerent applications include melamine-based plastics (melamine is a derivative of

s-triazine) and the potential use of s-tetrazine in molecular data storage applications (one

of the relaxation mechanisms of the S1 state leads to 2 HCN+N2.[24, 25, 26, 27, 28]).

Innes, Ross and Moomaw (IRM throughout this paper) published a compilation and critical

review of experimental vibration spectroscopic data current to 1988[29]. One of us (with

C. Van Alsenoy) carried out a harmonic-only B3LYP/cc-pVTZ study of the vibrational

frequencies and geometries.[30] The limitations of this approach are obvious.

In the present contribution, we will consider DFT anharmonic force ﬁelds and anharmonic

vibrational spectra — which are directly comparable to experiment — for the azabenzenes,

and demonstrate their power as a spectroscopic assignment tool for medium-sized organic

molecules.

II. COMPUTATIONAL DETAILS

In our validation study[15], we considered a wide variety of exchange-correlation

functionals, as well as convergence in terms of the basis set and the integration grids (both

3

Kohn-Sham, KS, and Coupled Perturbed Kohn-Sham).

Especially for organic molecules, we found the best performance to be delivered by

the B97-1 functional, which is Handy’s reparametrization[31] of Becke’s 1997 hybrid

functional[32]. Satisfactory basis set convergence was generally found to be achieved with

the TZ2P basis set[33]. This is therefore the functional/basis set combination employed for

the present study.

We found[15] results for anharmonic force ﬁeld calculations to be exceedingly dependent

on the KS integration grid, much less so on the CPKS grid. For the present study, we ended

up using a (200,974) grid, that is, the direct product of a 200-point Euler-MacLaurin radial

grid with a 974-point Lebedev angular grid. For the CPKS steps, we employed a (75,194)

grid, which considerably reduced the overall computational cost. Neither grid was pruned.

The quartic force ﬁelds were calculated by numerical central diﬀerences (in rectilinear

normal coordinates) of analytical second derivatives, using a stand-alone driver program

adapted from the CADPAC electronic structure program system[34]. The actual DFT

second derivative calculations were done using the Gaussian 98 Rev. A11 program

package[35].

The step size in a numerical derivatives calculation always represents a compromise

between discretization error and roundoﬀ error. Based on experience, we determined the

step size as a functions of both the absolute value of the harmonic frequency associated with

the normal coordinate involved, and the associated reduced mass (

In order to reduce roundoﬀ error as much as possible, the KS and CPKS equations were

basically converged to machine precision.

To calculate this factor, both the reduced mass of the mode mj and the eigenvalues

of the normalisation matrix lM W,jk are needed. The last part of equation 1, depending

on the harmonic frequencies ω, additionally ensures that each displaced geometry has

approximately the same energy diﬀerence to the minimum geometry.

In this manner, we obtain a complete cubic force ﬁeld, as well as all the diagonal and

semidiagonal quartic force constants. These are suﬃcient for second-order rovibrational

perturbation theory analyses[36, 37, 38, 39, 40], which were carried out using the

4

SPECTRO[41] and POLYAD[42] programs developed in the Cambridge group and at

Weizmann, respectively.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

A. Benzene

The parent molecule of our series, benzene (Figure 1a), has been the subject of a few

previous anharmonic force ﬁeld studies, two at the SCF/DZP level[43, 44], and a very

recent one at the B3LYP/TZ2P level[16]. An extensive experimental literature exists on

the subject (see Refs.[16, 45] for reviews): high resolution data are available for many of

the fundamentals, and all the assignments can be regarded as conclusive. (An analysis of

the B3LYP/cc-pVTZ normal modes of benzene and the azabenzenes in terms of Pulay’s

redundant internal coordinates can be found in Table 17 of Ref.[30].)

Experimentally obtaining harmonic frequencies for a molecule this large, even with such

high symmetry, is a nearly impossible task.

In Table I we compare computed harmonic

frequencies with selected prior calculations (in particular CCSD(T)/spdf data[46]), as well

as several sets of experimentally derived data. The ﬁrst such set are the ‘ωav’ estimates

of Handy, Murray and Amos (HMA)[47], themselves obtained as averages of an empirical

estimate by Goodman, Ozkabak, and Thakur (GOT)[45] and their own combination of

experimental fundamentals with the SCF/DZP computed anharmonicities of Maslen et

al.[43]. The second set are derived from the experimental fundamentals and a new SCF/DZP

anharmonic analysis by Handy and Willetts (HW)[44]. The third set is derived from the

experimental fundamentals and the B3LYP/TZ2P anharmonicities[16], and is expected to

be the most reliable.

Both sets of DFT numbers compare about equally well with the CCSD(T) data. The C-H

stretching frequencies are underestimated by about 20 cm−

1, while all other frequencies are

being reproduced very accurately.

(As an aside, we note that the C–H underestimation

problem also occurs[48] at the Møller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2) level.) Although

the C–H stretches are reproduced marginally worse by the B97-1 functional (3 cm−

1)

compared to the reference CCSD(T)/spdf values, the overall performance is improved: the

mean absolute error decreases from 9.3 (B3LYP) to 6.5 (B97-1) cm−

1, and the RMS deviation

5

from 10.6 (B3LYP) to 9.6 (B97-1). The smaller decrease for the RMS error (compared to the

mean absolute error) can be attributed to the greater proportional weight given to larger

errors. When excluding the C-H stretching frequencies, the RMS errors decrease to 8.4

(B3LYP) and 4.3 cm−

1 (B97-1). Considering the computational cost of density functional

theory, the B3LYP results are already of spectacular compared to the reference ab initio

data. The B97-1 functional, however, reduces the RMS error of the non C-H stretching

frequencies by an additional 50%.

Both functionals yield excellent agreement with experiment for the fundamental frequencies

(Table II). The experimental data were taken from the earlier compilation of GOT[45] and

from more recent gas-phase measurements[16]. The two sets of experimental data agree very

well with each other, except for ν16 and ν12 which are involved in strong Fermi resonances.

To obtain the B97-1/TZ2P fundamentals, we had to take the following Fermi resonances into

consideration: ν3 + ν16 and ν15 (with the deperturbed frequency ν15 at 3018 cm−

1 and the

combination at 2947 cm−

band at 3082 cm−

1), ν13 + ν16 and ν12 (unperturbed ν20 at 3040 and the combination
1), ν16 + ν13 and ν5 (with the unperturbed frequencies at 3064 and 3020

cm−

1), and ν2 + ν18 and ν16 (with ν16 (unperturbed) at 1600, ν2 + ν18 at 1603 cm−

1).

Interestingly, because of the small diﬀerences in the harmonic frequencies between the

B3LYP/TZ2P and the B97-1/TZ2P calculations and the diﬀerent force ﬁeld, now new Fermi

resonances are predicted. Furthermore, the fundamentals aﬀected by these resonances are

the ones which diﬀer the most when using the B3LYP or B97-1 functional. Because of the

Fermi resonances, the diﬀerence between diﬀerent functionals and methods becomes more

important than on the harmonic level of approximation. The results of both functionals

compared to experiment are, however, very similar, with mean absolute errors (compared

to the latest experimental results of Miani et al.[16]) of 9.4 (B3LYP) and 8.3 (B97-1) cm−

and RMS errors of 17.0 and 13.7 cm−

1, respectively. Again, all frequencies are very well

described with the exception of the C-H stretches, which are underestimated by 16–30 cm−

(discounting ν5 which is severely perturbed by resonances). Without the C-H stretches, the

mean absolute errors are reduced to 3.7 (B3LYP) and 3.9 (B97-1) cm−

1 and the RMS errors

to 4.8 (B3LYP) and 4.5 cm−

1 (B97-1). Hence, while clearly better for harmonic frequencies,

the B97-1 functional is only slightly better for predicting the fundamental frequencies of

1

1

benzene. Nevertheless, the accuracy obtained by density functional theory, which yields

RMS errors of less than 5 cm−

1 for non C-H stretching frequencies, is very good.

6

In the third column, we added the B97-1/TZ2P anharmonic corrections

to the

CCSD(T)/ANO4321 harmonic frequencies of Ref.[46], in order to see how such a ‘hybrid’

ab initio-DFT approach would perform. The principal improvement seen is for the C–

H stretches, which are thus all bought into the range of the experimental values, except

for ν5, which is in resonance with ν16 + ν13 as discussed above. When discounting C–H

stretching frequencies, the improvement compared to a pure B97-1/TZ2P calculation is

quite modest, to 3.1 cm−

1 for the mean absolute error and to 4.1 cm−

1 for the RMS error.

The corresponding error statistics including C–H stretching frequencies change rather more

signiﬁcantly, to a mean absolute error of 4.0 cm−

1 and an RMS error of 7.4 cm−

1.

Summarizing, B97-1/TZ2P is likely to be a useful tool for analysis of vibrational spectra

(and veriﬁcation of their assignments) of aromatic organic molecules in general and of the

azabenzene series in particular.

B. Pyridine

Pyridine being the simplest azabenzene (Figure 1b) and the closest to the parent molecule,

we may anticipate similar accuracy as for benzene. As expected for this chemically important

species, many experimental spectra are available, in both liquid and gas phases. Most of the

experimental results and the latest experimental assignments are summarized by Klots[49].

The computed and observed vibrational frequencies are presented in Table III. As expected,

the C-H stretching frequencies are not well described. Here, they are also heavily perturbed,

and, considering performance for the corresponding bands in benzene, our method may not

be suﬃciently accurate to assist in the experimental assignment. Thus, although we will

attempt to elaborate on the C-H stretching frequencies for most azabenzenes, the results

are more tentative. Additionally, a small change in the original unperturbed fundamental

frequencies will cause large changes in the perturbed frequencies. Nevertheless, the two

asymmetric stretches ν14 and ν15 do not follow the general trend of being underestimated
1. While the perturbed ν14 is close to the experimental value, ν15 diﬀers by
1. Especially the latter appears too large to be accounted for merely by deﬁciencies

by 20–40 cm−

70 cm−

in our DFT calculation. Here, the severe Fermi resonance seems to be responsible for

this assignment, as its deperturbed value is at 3021 cm−

1. This mode is resonating with

(deperturbed frequencies given) ν14 at 3053 cm−

1, ν4 + ν17 at 3015 cm−

1 and ν16 + ν5 at

7

3054 cm−

1, with the perturbed ν4 + ν17 now appearing at 3023 cm−

1. It appears that the

latter value is more in line with experiment, and that perhaps this assignment might be

more reasonable. Nevertheless, some caution is appropriate as the C–H harmonic stretching

frequencies are not as well described by DFT as the remaining modes. Large basis set

CCSD(T) harmonic frequencies would be helpful here, but would require inordinate amounts

of CPU time.

Another picture emerges for the non C-H frequency modes. Here, we primarily compare to

the medium resolution Raman vapor data of Klots (Klots2)[49]: their assignments seem to be

in line with most other experiments, although they diﬀer from the most recent data obtained

by Partal et al.[50]. Comparing to these latter inelastic neutron scattering (INS) data,

however, amounts to comparing apples and oranges, as the INS data are based on further

reﬁnement of a DFT computed harmonic force ﬁeld by maximizing agreement between

simulated and observed INS spectral. The pseudo-harmonic frequencies from the reﬁned

force ﬁeld correspond neither to true harmonic nor to true fundamental frequencies — in

eﬀect, they are neither ﬁsh nor fowl.

We can conﬁrm the assignment of Klots[49] of ν21 to the lower value of 1053 cm−

1. Diﬃcult

the only fundamentals which give errors of 10 cm−

assignments seem to result from the Fermi resonances for both ν4 and ν19, since these are
1 or larger. The deperturbed mode of ν4
1 resulting in perturbed modes at 1575

1 resonates with ν9 + ν10 at 1593 cm−
1. Klots may have misassigned the latter band to ν4 rather than ν9 + ν10. ν19,

and 1596 cm−

at 1578 cm−

on the other hand, seems to be very diﬃcult to assign from experimental data because of its

depolarized character. The problem is further exacerbated as ν19 is located at the shoulder

of ν6. Although ν19 is involved in a Fermi resonance, it is probably not the source of the

disagreement with, since its unperturbed frequency at 1241 cm−

1, resulting in bands at 1237 and 1289 cm−

at 1282 cm−

strongly perturbed bands (ν4 and ν19), the agreement between experiment and theory can

only be described as stunning for bands other than C-H stretches. For the latter, probably

only a full CCSD(T) force ﬁeld can resolve the assignment. Even when including ν4 and ν19

(but excluding all C-H stretching frequencies), the mean absolute error for the computed

values compared to the experimental data of Klots[49] is 3.6 cm−

1 and the RMS error is 5.3

cm−

1; without ν4 and ν19 they are reduced to 2.7 and 3.8 cm−

1, respectively.

The double-harmonic infrared intensities are in good agreement with the B3LYP/cc-pVTZ

8

values[30] and in reasonable agreement with the experimental numbers. Even here, the

C-H stretches diﬀer, probably not only because of anharmonic contributions and Fermi

resonances, but also because of the poor description of these modes by DFT. Still, the

excellent performance seen for benzene results is repeated for pyridine.

C. Pyridazine

Pyridazine (Figure 1c) has been of particular interest in the last couple of years [51, 52,

53]. A large body of experimental data is available, generally measured in the gas phase

but when certain modes were unavailable, the authors of Ref.[52, 53] substituted their own

liquid or solid phase measurements in order to get a full complement of frequencies. All

of the spectra have been assigned with the aid of scaled Hartree-Fock, MP2, BLYP or

B3LYP harmonic force ﬁelds using small basis sets. Some of them have their force ﬁelds

ﬁtted to match the experimental data. Despite the large amount of data, huge discrepancies

exist, as shown in Table IV. This seems to be especially true for the out-of-plane modes

where experimental assignments and values seem almost arbitrary. For ν11, for example, the

experimental numbers range from 765 to 949 cm−

1, and even the two most recent numbers

appear at opposite ends of this range. These assignments have been done using diﬀerent

methods and scaling techniques, since no reliable theoretical data were available at the time.

The same problem with the C-H stretches that was encountered for benzene and pyridine

occurs for pyridazine as well; the situation is further complicated since the experimental data

diﬀers and thus we cannot assign the frequencies of the experiment. Despite the discrepancies

between various experimental numbers, all the C-H stretches appear plausible within the

error range of our method.

As the INS data set dramatically varies from the remainder of the experimental data, and

because it did not appear to be reliable for pyridine, it was excluded from our analysis,

although it is reported in Table IV for completeness.

Since such a large amount of experimental data is available, it is best to discuss each mode

separately, starting with the in-plane modes.

• For ν3, all experiments except the ﬁrst of Ref.[54] agree on an assignment to the 1570
1 band. Our results, however, would seem to indicate that the assignment around

cm−

1555 cm−

1 might be more plausible.

• The same occurs for ν4. Experimental values of Refs.[53, 54] cluster around 1440

side.

• For ν5, signiﬁcant diﬀerences between experiments of Refs.[52, 54, 55] and the
1 can be found. The experimental results are thus

computed value of 1145 cm−

untenable in light of this huge discrepancy of more than a hundred cm−

1, and only

Ref.[55] proposes an assignment of 1160 cm−

1, which still appears to be on the high

• For ν6, most experiments have assignments around the computed 1157 cm−

1; however,

Ref.[53] assigned this mode to 1120 cm−

1 because of their previous assignment. Our

calculated ν5 and ν6 nearly coincide,

• For ν7, all experimental datasets are in agreement with each other and our calculations.

Considering the generally small anharmonicities for this type of vibrations, the

discrepancy of 40 cm−

1 between the computed ω8 and the observed ν8 seems to be a

bit on the large side. The experimental assignment may have been complicated by the

band’s position in an IR band envelope going from 960 to 980 cm−

1[53].

• As with ν5, the experimental assignment for ν9 of Vazquez et al.[53] diﬀers from

the other obtained fundamentals, and is the only one that can be conﬁrmed by our

calculations.

• For ν16, only Refs.[52, 54] diﬀer from the computed values, while for ν17, the

experimental assignment of Stidham and Tucci[55] both in the IR and the Raman

phase appear doubtful. ν18 agrees nicely with all experiments.

• For ν19 and ν20, the same assignment problems that we experienced for ν5 and ν6 seem
1 to ν19, only

to have occurred; while most experiments assign values above 1100 cm−

Vazquez et al.[53] seem to give the correct assignment. This results, however, in the

value of ν20 thus ending up a bit on the low side, and only the value of Ref.[55] ends up

close to our calculated number. The same seems to have happened to ν21, where only

Ref.[53] is in line with our calculations. Hence, for the in-plane modes, the data set of

10

Vazquez et al.[53] appears to be most reliable, excluding ν3 and ν6 (which appear to

be dubious assignments) and perhaps ν8 and ν20.

• For the out-of-plane modes, the experimental assignment appears to be even more

problematic. For ν22, all experiments diﬀer by 20 cm−

1, and are either found at 998 or

842 cm−

1. Both assignments appear to be unlikely, since the harmonic B97-1 frequency

is at 981 cm−

1, which would put the fundamental too low for 998 and deﬁnitely way

too high for assignment to the 842 cm−

1 band.

• For ν23, all experimental assignments are around the computed 751 cm−

1, while for ν24,

all the experiments appear to yield assignments higher than our computed fundamental

of 362 cm−

1.

• Based on our data, all the a2 symmetry modes (ν10 through ν13) should probably be

re-examined, since several experimental results diﬀer drastically from each other and

from our calculations. A discussion of these modes is almost impossible, and with the

exception of Refs. [53, 54] for ν13, all experimental assignments lie beyond the likely

error bars of the theoretical values.

On the whole, the pyridazine vibrational spectra deﬁnitely merit further investigation, as

the many experimental and theoretical datasets available are considerably at variance with

each other. Thus, it is impossible to give an error estimate for the method used based on this

molecule. However if our computational results prove to be as accurate as for benzene and

pyridine, the experimental spectra have to be reexamined. Based on this study, one might

wonder whether the addition of more nitrogens or the N-N bond is causing the deterioration

of the calculated values.

D. Pyrimidine

Pyrimidine (Figure 1d), has been studied less in recent years. Notable are the IR

experiments compiled by IRM[29], the IR experiments of Billes et al.[52], and the inelastic

neutron scattering work of Navarro et al.[56]. Here, we compare mainly to the IR

experiments, since the INS data for neither pyridine nor pyridazine agree well with our

computed values and the other experiments, for reasons outlined above. Nevertheless,

11

for pyrimidine the INS data seem a lot closer to the IR data than for the previous

two azabenzenes (Table V). The values for the a1 C-H stretches are in agreement with

experiment, although this seems fortuitous. Otherwise, all in-plane modes are within 8

cm−

1 of experiment, with the sole exception of ν17. Interestingly, both ν7 and ν9 undergo

strong Fermi type 1 and 2 resonances; their resonance matrices are displayed in TableVI with

their respective eigensolutions. For ν7, very small changes in the unperturbed fundamentals

would result in the value ending up not at 1071 cm−

1, but at the experimental assignment

of 1065 cm−

1. The assignment of the two resonating modes appears to be purely arbitrary.

As for ν9, the resonating overtone of ν24 matches the experimental number exactly. Since

both modes are in resonance, the overtone might have “borrowed intensity” (as described

in Ref.[57]) from ν9, and thus the assignment.

When looking at the out-of-plane modes in Table V, only ν10 and ν20 yield diﬀerent results

compared to the ﬁrst set of experimental results. Both discrepancies have been mentioned

before by the harmonic-only study[30], and ν20 has a very small intensity. Moreover, by

using scaled HF frequencies, Wiberg[58] has suggested that the assignment for ν10 might

also be incorrect. The IRM[29] assignments for modes 5, 6, 13 and 21 appear more plausible

than from Ref.[52]. Neglecting the problematic modes 10 and 20 and reassigning mode

9 to 677 cm−

1, the errors, including the C-H stretches, are 6.3 (mean absolute) and 11.4

cm−

1 (RMS), and without them are 4.1 and 5.3 cm−

1, respectively. Thus this method again

appears to be very reliable for predicting fundamental frequencies.

E. Pyrazine

As with pyrimidine, only few experiments have been done for pyrazine (Figure 1e).

The vibrational assignments are displayed in Table VII.

In Ref.[52], assignments were

done in the gas phase for the IR active modes and in a melt for the Raman spectrum.

Overall, the agreement is again very good for modes other than C-H stretches.

If the

previously mentioned tendency to underestimate the C-H stretches is taken into account,

all assignments appear plausible, with the possible exception of the assignment of ν11 from

Ref.[52]. It should be noted that all of the C-H stretches are perturbed by Fermi resonances.

For the in-plane modes, especially ν21 appears to lie beyond the error bars of our method.

It has been mentioned by the harmonic-only study in Ref.[30] that this ‘Kekul´e mode’ is

12

problematic and it was concluded that this mode has signiﬁcant multireference character,

since it corresponds to the dissociation into 2 HCN + C2H2. However, hybrid density

functionals are usually capable to describe nondynamical correlation to a certain extent,

since for example the atomization energy of ozone is reasonably well reproduced. For this

mode, the assignment of Ref.[59] appears to be out of question.

For all the other modes, most the experiments scatter only by about 5 cm−

1, with

this agreement suggesting that their assignments and values are pretty accurate. The

out-of-plane modes are generally quite well described by theory. Note that the two au

modes since they are neither IR nor Raman active; for this reason they are not assigned in

Ref.[52]. The INS values are somewhat disappointing for both frequencies, since the chief

advantage of this method is the ability to predict such bands. Another discrepancy is the

ﬁrst b2g mode (ν9), although the second experiment of Ref.[52] is closer to our values.

This leads to mean absolute and RMS errors compared to Ref.[52] (Ref.[59]) of 7.8 (7.9)

and 10.4 (11.1) cm−

1 including the C-H stretches, and of 5.4 (5.1) and 6.9 (6.5) cm−

1 when

excluding them. If the problematic ν2 and ν9 are excluded, the mean absolute and RMS

errors for the non C-H stretches reduces to 4.1 (4.1) and 5.4 (5.5) cm−

1, respectively. Thus,

the general RMS discrepancy of 5 to 7 cm−

1 is obtained for pyrazine as well.

F. 1,3,5 Triazine (s-Triazine)

1,3,5-Triazine (Figure 1f) is the only azabenzene with a degenerate point group symmetry

(D3h). Because of this, the a′2 modes (ν4 and ν5) are both IR and Raman inactive. The INS
[60] value for nu4 coincides exactly with our calculation (Table VIII); the discrepancy of
1 for ν5 is outlandish even for the INS data and this band is probably misassigned.

124 cm−

The inelastic neutron scattering data[50, 51, 56, 60, 61] are clearly inferior to the other

experimental datasets. This is hardly surprising as this method relies on ﬁtting and scaling

a harmonic force ﬁeld which is obtained from DFT in small split-valence basis sets. Already

for the harmonics, this introduces errors on the order of about 50 cm−

1. The error for

the C-H stretches is expected to be even larger. It would be interesting to reanalyze their

data based on the present anharmonic force ﬁelds, although this still would not resolve

the problems associated with the C-H stretches, for which large basis set coupled cluster

13

frequencies would be desirable. The experimental IR/Raman data of Daunt et al.[62] and

Lancaster et al.[63] are very similar to those of IRM[29] and are not listed in Table VIII.

With the exception of the ﬁrst e′′ ν12 and the C-H stretches, which are again underestimated,

all computed values are within 11 cm−

1 of experiment Again, the errors are similar to the

other azabenzenes; including the C-H stretches, the mean absolute error is 7.6 cm−

1 and the

RMS error 11 cm−

and 7.5 (5.0) cm−

1. Excluding the stretches (and ν12), these numbers reduce to 5.1 (3.4)
1, respectively.

G. 1,2,3-Triazine

For 1,2,3-Triazine (Figure 1g), only one IR and Raman spectrum in KBr has been

experimentally determined[64]:

the assignment was assisted by scaled MP2/6-31G*

harmonic frequencies. The spectrum looks very similar to that of pyrimidine; even the

same Fermi resonances are present.

At ﬁrst glance at the spectra in Table IX, the agreement between theory and experiment

is disappointing. For very few of the modes is there agreement between the spectra.

However, the authors did not consider any Fermi resonances in the lower spectrum (although

they noted that one might exist, involving ν17), and simply assumed the ordering of the

fundamentals to be identical to that of the MP2/6-31G* harmonics. This however leads

to obvious misassignments. For example, ν6 and ν18 lie almost on top of each other, while

ν12 + ν13 borrows intensity from ν6 because of the Fermi resonance, as can be seen in Table

X.

If the resonance were not as strong as computed — speciﬁcally, if the unperturbed

fundamental were shifted only a few cm−

presently calculated at 1056 cm−

1 towards higher values, the perturbed ν12 + ν13,
1,

1, might easily correspond to the band at 1064 cm−

assigned to ν6 in Ref.[64]. The same actually applies to ν20, which has a strong Fermi

resonance with ν9 + ν13, that has, however, been calculated at a lower value of 644 cm−

1.

We have also reassigned the ﬁrst a1 C-H stretch (mode 1), since the discrepancy between

experiment and theory appears too high even for a C-H stretch. Needless to say, this

mode also has a strong Fermi resonance with the 2ν15 overtone, which has its largest

component for the eigenvector with associated eigenvalue at at 3100 cm−

1, again explaining

the experimental value perfectly. The only other value which is still in question would be a

small peak at 1597 cm−

1, which might correspond to an impurity; a band was found that

14

was assigned to acetylene, a fragmentation product of 1,2,3-triazine. The value of 318 cm−

1,

which has been reported for ν13 is actually just a scaled Hartree-Fock harmonic frequency.

Therefore, a dramatic change in the errors is obtained by reassigning the experimental

spectrum.

Including the C-H stretches in the error analysis, the mean absolute error

decreases from 17.7 to 4.7 cm−

1 and the RMS error from 27.9 to 6.1 cm−

1. By excluding

the C-H stretches, the mean absolute and RMS errors improve from 14.6 and 22.1 cm−

1,

respectively, to 4.1 and 5.2 cm−

1. Thus, accuracy consistent with the preceding azabenzenes

can be obtained following some reassignments in the experimental spectrum. This also

corroborates our conclusion concerning pyridazine that neither substitution of C-H by N nor

N-N bonds seem to be responsible for the discrepancies between experimental and computed

vibrational spectra.

H. 1,2,4-Triazine

Because 1,2,4-triazine (Figure 1h) is highly unstable, only one “full” experimental

spectrum has been measured as a liquid ﬁlm[65], although more recently two high-resolution

IR spectra have been recorded for four frequencies[66, 67]. For the C-H stretches (Table

XI), possibly ν1 and ν2 may have been swapped, since they both take part in a large

resonance matrix block. Overall, ten frequencies and combination bands interact forming

this large resonance block that include modes 1 to 3. Hence, it is not surprising that a

correct assignment based merely on experimental data would be problematic. With this

swap, all three C-H stretches are underestimated by the usual 10-30 cm−

1. Only ν11 appears

questionable in view of our results. However, ν9 has a Fermi resonance with the combination

of ν17 and ν21, and the resonance, eigenvector and eigenvalue matrices are displayed in Table

XII. The Fermi resonances displayed in these tables are similar to pyrimidine, 1,2,3-triazine

and 1,2,4-triazine. Assuming that both of the Fermi resonances are slightly stronger than

predicted, since ν21 is underestimated by 3 cm−

1 compared to the high-resolution IR data,

the new ν17 + ν21 could well end up lower than the predicted 1143 cm−

1, explaining the

value of 1136 cm−

1 that would then not be assigned to any mode. The assignment of ν11 in

the experiment would then correspond to ν10, in agreement with the calculated spectrum.

The assignment of ν13 also appears to be incorrect.

Of the four modes obtained by high-resolution IR, the newer data for ν12 validates our

15

computational value of 1044 cm−

1 rather than the 1050 cm−

1 predicted by the older

experiment. On the other hand, the low-resolution IR value of 769 cm−

1 for mode 19 is

closer to the hi-res data compared to our predicted 779 cm−

1. These new experiments show

the usefulness of the theoretical value, since its resolution is apparently even comparable to

that obtained by low-resolution IR data.

Without making any reassignments to the experimental spectrum, the mean absolute

error from experiment is 13.6 cm−

1, and the RMS error is 19.2 cm−

1 including the C-H

stretches. This appears to be quite large in comparison to the other azabenzenes. With the

abovementioned suggested reassignments, these errors change to 7.5 cm−

1 and 10.0 cm−

1,

respectively. Excluding the C-H stretches, we once again end up with a mean absolute error

of 5.1 cm−

1 and an RMS error of 5.8 cm−

1.

I. 1,2,4,5-Tetrazine (s- Tetrazine)

For 1,2,4,5-Tetrazine (Figure 1i), CCSD(T) harmonic frequencies are available in the

literature[25]. Unfortunately, they were calculated with all electrons correlated in a basis

set (6-311G**) that is only minimal in the inner-shell orbitals. The resulting errors in

harmonic frequencies can easily exceed 20 cm−

1 for small molecules[68], several times larger

than the actual eﬀect of neglecting core correlation (typically less than 10 cm−

1 in HCNOF

systems[69]). We have recomputed the CCSD(T)/6-311G** frequencies correlating only

valence electrons (Table XIII). For the in-plane modes, diﬀerences with the all-electron

calculations are quite minor (6 cm−

1 or less). The out-of-plane modes, however, are

drastically aﬀected, up to 60 cm−

1 (Table XIII, especially the au and the second b3u

frequencies). This adds yet another stanza to the long litany of rejoinders in the literature

(e.g.[70]) against the practice of correlating inner-shell electrons in basis sets unsuitable for

the purpose.

We have recalculated the harmonic frequencies at the CCSD(T) level (frozen core) with

basis sets of spdf quality, speciﬁcally Dunning’s popular cc-pVTZ [71] and the Alml¨of-Taylor

atomic natural orbital[72] basis set used in Ref.[46] for benzene. The CCSD(T)/cc-pVTZ and

CCSD(T)/ANO4321 frequencies (Table XIII) are in excellent agreement with each other,

the largest diﬀerence being 6 cm−

1 for the lowest frequency (ω18).

(This is very unlike

the case of benzene[46], where the two b2g modes are hypersensitive to the basis set and

16

diﬀer signiﬁcantly even between cc-pVTZ and ANO4321.) . The two corresponding modes

in s-tetrazine display appreciable diﬀerences between 6-311G* and cc-pVTZ but barely

between cc-pVTZ and ANO4321.) In contrast, the CCSD(T)/6-311G** frequencies diﬀers

signiﬁcantly from both data sets, particularly for the two b2g modes (39 and 33 cm−

1 w.r.t.

ANO4321), followed by the lowest b2u mode (a.k.a.

‘Kekul´e mode’, 27 cm−

1) and the au

mode (25 cm−

1, but a relative error of 7%). So even for a valence-only CCSD(T) calculation,

the 6-311G** basis set is insuﬃcient, and the RMS deviation from the CCSD(T)/ANO4321

results, 16.4 cm−

1 (17.3 when excluding the C-H stretching frequencies), is comparable to

that of the much more cost-eﬀective B97-1 calculations, 18.1 (15.1) cm−

1.

Turning now to the B97-1/TZ2P harmonic frequencies, the most notable diﬀerences with
the CCSD(T)/ANO4321 data are for the CH stretches (underestimates of 34 cm−1 for both)
and the Kekul´e mode (overestimated by 37 cm−1). Possibly, self-interaction error would

adversely aﬀect[73] the presently used functional’s description of the potential surface along

the Kekul´e mode, and it would be interesting how a self-interaction corrected functional

would perform. Unfortunately no implementation of such a functional is available to the

authors, let alone an implementation including analytical derivatives. Exclusive of this mode

and the CH stretches, the RMS deviation between the CCSD(T)/ANO4321 and B97-1/TZ2P

frequencies is about 11 cm−

1, compared to just 4 cm−

1 for benzene.

As expect, agreement between B97-1/TZ2P fundamentals and experiment is likewise

compromised (Table XIV). We note that s-tetrazine is both the least stable and the most

‘inorganic’ molecule of the series, and that it has a low-lying excited state at less than 2

eV[25]. If we combine the CCSD(T)/ANO4321 harmonic frequencies with the B97-1/TZ2P

anharmonic corrections, the picture brightens somewhat. Compared to the assignment of

IRM[29], the RMS deviation amounts to 9.8 cm−

1 if the symmetric C–H stretch is excluded.

The peculiarly large splitting of 76 cm−

1 between IRM’s symmetric and asymmetric CH

stretches is impossible to reconcile with any of our calculations, all of which suggest a very

small splitting on the order of just 3 cm−

1, in agreement with the earlier ﬁlm IR and Raman

study of Sigworth and Pace (SP)[74]. (Their band origin of 3089 cm−

1 for the symmetric CH

stretch is quite compatible with our calculations: IRM’s value of 3010 cm−

1 was taken from

single-vibronic-level ﬂuorescence spectra[75]. An older gas-phase study by Franks, Merer,

and Innes (FMI)[76] found both CH stretches at 3090 cm−

1; the symmetric one in the IR,

the antisymmetric one in the Raman spectrum.) Our calculations do not reveal a resonance

17

interaction aﬀecting ν1 that is severe enough to make a large CH symmetric/antisymmetric

spllitting plausible. We hence conclude that ν1 of IRM is erroneous.

One other IRM assignment which is diﬃcult to reconcile with our best calculations

concerns the highest b3u mode (calculated: 902, IRM: 929 cm−

1) for which the Franks,

Merer, and Innes[76] value of 904 cm−

1 nearly perfectly matches our calculation. It would

appear that even the somewhat degraded performance, exhibited by our model for this

molecule, still ought to be quite useful for resolving assignment issues or guiding high-

resolution spectroscopic measurements.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

We have assessed the performance of modern density functional theory (particularly,

B97-1/TZ2P) for the anharmonic vibrational spectra of a series of related medium-sized

molecules. The C-H stretching frequencies are consistently underestimated by about 20-30

cm−

1; disregarding them, the level of agreement with experiment that can be achieved is

quite astonishing (on the order of 6 cm−

1 RMS deviation for fundamentals). Somewhat

poorer accuracy is achieved for pyridazine and particularly for s-tetrazine. For several

systems (particularly 1,2,3-triazine), our calculations strongly suggest revised assignments

of the observed frequencies. For pyridazine, unfortunately, the experimental results are

mutually contradictory and our analysis inconclusive. For s-tetrazine, basically all predicted

fundamentals agree less well with experiment; the more ‘inorganic’ character of the molecule

may have adversely aﬀected the performance of our calculations. Nevertheless, even here a

RMS deviation of about 15 cm−

1 for DFT and 10 cm−

1 for the combined CCSD(T)/DFT

results is obtained.

Overall, B97-1/TZ2P quartic force ﬁelds combined with second-order

rovibrational

perturbation theory shows great promise for the assignment of vibrational spectra of

medium-sized organic molecules.

[70] Little can be added to this statement: “Using valence-optimized basis sets and including core-

correlation is not only a waste of computer time, but a potential source of problems, as it can

substantially increase BSSE. This point is not well appreciated: the prevailing view appears

to be that no harm can come of correlating the core when the basis set is inadequate. This is

not so.” (Taylor, P. R.; In Lecture Notes in Quantum Chemistry; Roos, B. O., Ed.; Springer:

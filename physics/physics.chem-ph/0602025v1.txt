Abstract

We report the results of intensive numerical calculations for four atomic H2+H2 energy transfer collision. A
parallel computing technique based on LAM/MPI functions is used. In this algorithm, the data is distributed to the
processors according to the value of the momentum quantum number J and its projection M . Most of the work is
local to each processor. The topology of the data communication is a simple star. Timings are given and the scaling
of the algorithm is discussed. Two different recently published potential energy surfaces for the H2−H2 system
are applied. New results obtained for the state resolved excitation-deexcitation cross sections and rates valuable for
astrophysical applications are presented. Finally, more sophisticated extensions of the parallel code are discussed.

Keywords: Parallel algorithm, LAM/MPI application, Star-type cluster, quantum dynamics.

I. INTRODUCTION

In modern competitive research in science and technology high performance computing plays a paramount role. Its
importance is derived from the fact, that correctly chosen and designed numerical methods and algorithms properly
adapted to parallel and multithreaded techniques can essentially reduce computation time and active memory usage
[1]. The importance of this fact is especially magniﬁed in calculating quantum molecular dynamics and atomic
collisions due to their massive complexity.

Generally speaking, modern computation research in scientiﬁc applications has taken two twists. First, to provide
efﬁcient and stable numerical calculations, and second to provide for the proper use of various high performance
techniques like LAM/MPI, OpenMP and/or others [2]. Now it is equally important not only to get the correct
numerical results, but also to design and implement efﬁcient high performance algorithms and get faster results
with less memory. We would like to note here, that a program/software, which is designed for speciﬁc problems
in computational physics, chemistry or biology should be able to perform calculations in either serial or parallel.
The problem we selected for our parallel computation in this work is taken from molecular/chemical physics.
Speciﬁcally we carry out detailed quantum-mechanical calculations of state-resolved cross sections and rates
in hydrogen molecular collisions H2+H2. Interaction and collisions between hydrogen molecules, and hydrogen
molecular isotopes, for example H2+HD, is of great theoretical and experimental interest for many years [3-14].
Speciﬁcally we will explore the quantum-mechanical 4-atomic system shown in Fig. 1 using six independent
variables resulting in the full description of the system. The main goal of this investigation is to carry out a
comparative analysis of two recently published potential energy surfaces (PESs) for H2−H2.

Our motivation for selecting this problem is, that the hydrogen molecule plays an important role in many areas of
astrophysics [15-16] This is the simplest and most abundant molecule in the universe especially in giant molecular
clouds. Because of low number of electrons in H2−H2 this is one of few four-center systems for which potential
energy surface (PES) can be developed with very high precision. Therefore H2+H2 may be also a benchmark
collision for testing other dynamical methods. Additionally, the H2+H2 elastic and inelastic collisions are of interest
in combustion, spacecraft modeling and at the present hydrogen gas is becoming a very important potential energy
supplier, see for example [17].

We test two PESs: the ﬁrst one is a global 6-dimensional potential from work [18], the second one is very
accurate interaction potential calculated from the ﬁrst principles [19]. Because we are going to carry out detailed
quantum-mechanical calculations using two PESs the computation work is at least doubled and therefore even

more time consuming. We needed to carry out convergence tests with respect to different chemical and numerical
parameters for both PESs and, ﬁnally, we have to make production calculations for many points of kinetic energy
collisions. Clearly, an application of parallel computing techniques shall be very useful in this situation.

In this work we carry out parallel computation with up to 14 processors. The scattering cross sections and their
corresponding rate coefﬁcients are calculated using a non reactive quantum-mechanical close-coupling approach.
In the next section we will shortly outline the quantum-mechanical method and the parallelization approach. Our
calculations for H2+H2, scaling and timing results are presented in Sec. III. Conclusions are given in Sec. IV.
Atomic units (e=me=¯h=1) are used throughout the work.

A. Quantum-mechanical approach

II. METHOD

In this section we brieﬂy represent a quantum-mechanical approach and the parallel algorithm used in this work.
The 4-atomic H2−H2 system is shown in Fig. 1. It can be described by six independent variables: r1 and r2
are interatomic distances in each hydrogen molecule, Θ1 and Θ2 are polar angles, Φ is torsional angle and R is
intermolecule distance. The hydrogen molecules are treated as linear rigid rotors, that is distances r1 = r2 = 0.74A
are ﬁxed in this model. We provide a numerical solution for the Schr¨odinger equation for an ab + cd collision in
the center of the mass frame, where ab and cd are linear rigid rotors.

To solve the equation the total 4-atomic H2+H2 wave function is expanded into channel angular momentum
α′ (ˆr1, ˆr2, ~R) [4]. This procedure followed by separation of angular momentum provides a set of coupled

where α ≡ (j1j2j12L), j1 + j2 = j12, j12 + L = J and j1, j2, L are quantum angular momentum corresponding
to vectors ~r1, ~r2 and ~R respectively, M12 = (ma + mb)(mc + md)/(ma + mb + mc + md), V (~r1, ~r2, ~R) is the
potential energy surface for the 4-atomic system abcd, and kα is channel wavenumber.

We apply the hybrid modiﬁed log-derivative-Airy propagator in the general purpose scattering code MOLSCAT
[20] to solve the coupled radial equations (1). We have tested other propagator schemes included in the code. Our
calculations showed that other propagators are also quite stable for both the H2−H2 potentials considered in this
work.

Since all experimentally observable quantum information about the collision is contained in the asymptotic
behaviour of functions U JM
α (R → ∞), the log-derivative matrix is propagated to large R-intermolecular distances.
The numerical results are matched to the known asymptotic solution to derive the physical scattering S-matrix [4].
The method was used for each partial wave until a converged cross section was obtained. It was veriﬁed that results
are converged with respect to the number of partial waves as well as the matching radius Rmax for all channels
included in the calculations. Cross sections for rotational excitation and relaxation phenomena can be obtained
directly from the S-matrix. In particular the cross sections for excitation from j1j2 → j′

B. Parallelization

In this work to support parallel computation the following machines are used: Sun Netra-X1 (UltraAX-i2) with
128 MB RAM (512 MB Swap) and 500 Mhz UltraSPARC-IIe processor. The master computer is SunFire v440
with 8 GB RAM four 1.062 Ghz UltraSPARC-IIIi processors. The system is schematically shown in Fig. 2. In this
work we apply LAM/MPI to provide the parallel environment in the cluster.

It is important in the parallel algorithm used in this work, that calculations for speciﬁc values of J and M
are essentially independent. In the PMP MOLSCAT program [21], which is used the parallelization is done over
the loop on values J and M . The code distributes the required JM pairs across the available processors. The
computational work distribution is shown schematically in Fig. 3. The same idea has been used in works [22], [23]
for semiquantal atomic collisions. In these works the parallelization was done along the impact factor ρ of colliding
particles, because the solution of the resulting dynamical equations doesn’t depend on ρ. It is well known, that in
the semiclassical approach the impact factor ρ is an analog of quantum J number.

As mentioned above, in the quantum-mechanical approach used in this work, a partial wave expansion is applied.
A set of coupled channel differential equations has to be solved for many values of the total angular momentum J.
To calculate the state resolved cross sections and then the rate coefﬁcients (3) the resulting S-matrix elements have
to be summed from different Js. Calculations for a single J can be broken into two or more sectors corresponding
to different values of M , which is a projection of J.

There are two methods to distribute the work among satellite computers. In the static method in the beginning
of the job each computer makes a list of the total J/M tasks to be solved. Then each computer selects a subset
of the tasks to carry out. Obviously each computer has to get a different subset and an approach needs to be used
which gives an approximately equal amount of work to each computer. There is no interprocessor communication
in this method.

In the case of a dynamic approach one computer acts as a dispatcher. It makes a list of all the J/M tasks to
be done, then waits for the computational processes to call in requesting work. Starting with the longest tasks, the
dispatcher hands out J/M tasks to computing processes until all of them have been completed. The next time the
computational process asks for work, the dispatcher sends it a message, and the computational process then does
its end-of-run cleanup and exits.

expansion model was chosen to ﬁt the surface. It was demonstrated, that the calculated PES can reproduce the
quadrupole moment to within 0.58 % and the experimental well depth to within 1 %.

The bond length was ﬁxed at 1.449 a.u. or 0.7668 ˚A. DJ PES is deﬁned by the center-of-mass intermolecular
distance, R, and three angles: θ1 and θ2 are the plane angles and φ12 is the relative torsional angle. The angular
increment for each of the three angles deﬁning the relative orientation of the dimers was chosen to be 30◦.

The BMKP PES [18] is a global six-dimensional potential energy surface for two hydrogen molecules. It was
especially constructed to represent the whole interaction region of the chemical reaction dynamics of the four-atomic
system and to provide an accurate as possible van der Waals well. In the six-dimensional conformation space of
the four atomic system the conical intersection forms a complicated three-dimensional hypersurface. The authors
of the work [18] mapped out a large portion of the locus of this conical intersection.

The BMKP PES uses cartesian coordinates to compute distances between four atoms. We have devised some
fortran code, which converts spherical coordinates used in Sec. 2 to the corresponding cartesian coordinates and
computes the distances between the four atoms. In all our calculations with this potential the bond length was ﬁxed
at 1.449 a.u. or 0.7668 ˚A as in DJ PES.

The main goal of this work is to carry out quantum-mechanical calculations for different transitions in p-
H2+p-H2 and o-H2+o-H2 collisions and to provide a comparative study of the two PESs presented above. The
energy dependence of the elastic integral cross sections σel(Ekin) are represented in Fig. 4 (upper plots) together
2(Ekin) for the j1 = j2 = 0 → j′
2 = 2 and
with the state-resolved integral cross sections σj1j2→j ′
1j ′
j1 = j2 = 1 → j′
2 = 3 rotational transitions (lower plots) for both the BMKP and DJ PESs respectively.
As can be seen both PESs provide the same type of the behaviour in the cross section. These results are in basic
agreement with recent calculations, but using a time-dependent quantum-mechanical approach [10]. Our calculation
show, that DJ PES generates higher values for the cross sections.

1 = 2, j′

1 = 1, j′

A large number of test calculations have also been done to secure the convergence of the results with respect to
all parameters that enter into the propagation of the Schr¨odinger equation. This includes the intermolecular distance
R, the total angular momentum J of the four atomic system, Nlvl the number of rotational levels to be included
in the close coupling expansion and others (see the MOLSCAT manual [20]).

We reached convergence for the integral cross sections, σ(Ekin), in all considered collisions. In the case of
DJ PES the propagation has been done from 2 ˚A to 10 ˚A, since this potential is deﬁned only for those speciﬁc

distances. For the BMKP PES we used rmin = 1 ˚A to rmax = 30 ˚A. We also applied a few different propagators
included in the MOLSCAT program.

A convergence test with respect to the maximum value of the total orbital momentum showed, that Jmax = 100
is good enough for the considered range of energies in this work. We tested various rotational levels j1j2 included
in the close coupling expansion for the numerical propagation of the resulting coupled equations (1). In these test
calculations we used two basis sets: j1j2=00, 20, 22, 40, 42 with total basis set size Nlvl = 13 and j1j2=00, 20,
22, 40, 42, 44, 60, 62 with Nlvl = 28. We found [24], that the results are quite stable for the 00→20 and 00→22
transitions and somewhat stable for the highly excited 00→40 transition. Nontheless, for our production calculations
we used the ﬁrst basis set.

It is important to point out here, that for comparison purposes we don’t include the compensating factor of 2
mentioned in [5]. However, in Fig. 4 (upper plots) and in our subsequent calculations of the thermal rate coefﬁcients,
kjj ′(T ), the factor is included.

1 = 0, j′

The differences in the cross sections of the two potentials are reﬂected in the state-resolved transition states
j1 = 0, j2 = 0 → j′
2 = 2, as shown in Fig. 5 (right panel). It seems that the DJ PES can provide much
better results, as seen in the same ﬁgure in the left panel, when we present the results for the corresponding
thermal rates k00−02(T ) calculated with the DJ potential together with results of other theoretical calculations. The
agreement is perfect. Thus, one can conclude, that DJ PES is better suited for the H2−H2 system. In Fig. 6 we
provide thermal rates for different transition states calculated with only the DJ PES and in comparison with other
theoretical data obtained within different dynamical methods and PESs. Again the agreement is very good.

In Fig. 7 we present an example of our timing results using the dynamic method for a speciﬁc H2(j1)+H2(j2)
calculations. It can be seen, that including additional processors reduces the computation time. Here we present
two results. The left plot shows dependence of the computing time on amount of active parallel processors. The
right plot illustrates the degree of speed-up of the calculations. The speed-up for a ﬁxed test calculation is deﬁned
as t1/tnp, where t1 is the calculation with only one processor and tnp with np processors.

We carried out parallel computations for state-resolved rotational excitation and deexcitation cross sections and
rates in molecular para-/para- and ortho-/ortho-H2 collisions of astrophysical interest. The LAM/MPI technique
allowed us to speed up the computation process at least ∼ 4.5 times within our 14 processor Sun Unix cluster.

We tested the two newest potential energy surfaces for the considered systems. Thus the application of the parallel
algorithm reduced the computation time used to test the two potentials. A test of convergence and the results for
cross sections and rate coefﬁcients using two different potential energy surfaces for the H2−H2 system have been
obtained for a wide range of kinetic energies.

We would like to point out here, that the hydrogen problem is very important for many reasons. The main
motivation has been described in the introduction of this paper. It is also necessary to stress, that the hydrogen-
hydrogen collision may be particularly interesting in nanotechnology applications, when the system is conﬁned
inside a single wall carbon nanotube (SWNT) [25].

Careful treatment of such collisions can bring useful information about the hydrogen adsorption mechanisms in
SWNTs and quantum sieving selectivities [26]. However, in this problem particular attention should be paid not
only to the H2−H2 potential, but also to the many body interaction between H2 molecules and the carbon nanotube
[27-28]. The inclusion of additional complex potentials in the Schr¨odinger equation may essentially increase the
computation difﬁculties.

It is also very attractive to upgrade the four-dimensional model for the linear rigid rotors used in this work to
complete six-dimensional consideration of the H2+H2 collisions. However, because of two additional integrations
over r1 and r2 distances such calculations should be very time consuming

where v designates the vibrational quantum numbers v1 and v2 [29]. Nontheless, the application of a parallel
computing techniques together with shared memory methodology could be a very effective computational approach,
as it was partially demonstrated in this work.

Although our calculations revealed, that both the H2−H2 PESs used in this work can provide the same type
of behaviour in regard to cross sections and rates, there are still signiﬁcant differences. Considering the results of
these calculations we conclude that subsequent work is needed to further improve the H2−H2 PES, and that work
will require parallel processing if it is to be done in a timely manner.

Using approximate partition functions and a master equation approach, we investigate the statis-
tical relaxation toward equilibrium in selected CaArn clusters. The Gaussian theory of absorption
[J. Chem. Phys., 000, 0000, 2003] is employed to calculate the average photoabsorption intensity
associated with the 4s2 → 4s14p1 transition of calcium as a function of time during relaxation. In
CaAr6 and CaAr10 simple relaxation is observed with a single time scale. CaAr13 exhibits much
slower dynamics and the relaxation occurs over two distinct time scales. CaAr37 shows much slower
relaxation with multiple transients, reminiscent of glassy behavior due to competition between dif-
ferent low-energy structures. We interpret these results in terms of the underlying potential energy
surfaces for these clusters.

INTRODUCTION

Clusters of van der Waals atoms or molecules are
known to exhibit signiﬁcant ﬁnite size eﬀects1 in their
thermodynamic behavior. In particular, their structure
and low-temperature stable phase can strongly depend
on size. By doping such clusters with a chromophoric
atom, spectroscopic techniques are able to characterize
the structure of the whole complex. Very often, the chro-
mophore only acts as a small perturbation on the geom-
etry of the host van der Waals cluster, and spectroscopy
can then be used as a probe of structure and structural
changes in the cluster. These ideas, which date back
to experimental studies in the eighties,2,3 have received
some theoretical support in the recent years.4,5 In the
previous paper in this series,6 the inﬂuence of tempera-
ture and cluster size on the photoabsorption spectrum in
CaArn clusters was investigated. In some cases, such as
CaAr13 or CaAr37, features in the absorption spectrum
were seen to originate from the competition between spe-
ciﬁc isomers. These results were obtained using the quan-
tum superposition method,7 which yields ergodic data by
construction from a database of local minima on the po-
tential energy surface (PES).

However, the equilibrium properties computed from
the superposition approach obviously provide no infor-
mation about the way in which equilibrium was estab-
lished, or how long equilibration would take from a
given starting distribution. As was shown by Miller
and coworkers,8 relaxation can be rather slow when
the competing minima are separated by large (free)
energy barriers.
In cases such as Ar38, conventional
molecular dynamics simulations are presently unable to
reach equilibrium and thus cannot provide estimates
of the rate constants. However, the master equation
dynamics approach,
introduced in cluster physics by
Kunz and Berry,11 has been successfully applied to this
system,12 although a subsequent discrete path sampling

study located somewhat faster pathways.14 In partic-
ular, it has been used to calculate activation energies
in the interconversion of (NaCl)−
35 nanocrystals15 that
could be compared to those extracted from ion mobility
measurements.13

It is important to characterize the dynamics of the
CaArn clusters investigated previously at thermodynam-
ical equilibrium, because the time required for reaching
equilibrium may not always be accessible in experiments.
In addition, the most powerful way to investigate phase
changes through spectroscopy on single clusters may re-
quire ion trapping.35,36 In principle, this technique can
be used to examine the system over very long time scales,
which makes it a possible tool for studying dynamics, in-
cluding relaxation toward thermal equilibrium, possibly
via kinetic traps.

This article is a natural extension to our previous work,
and provides an investigation of the relaxation dynamics
in some selected CaArn clusters, as evidenced by their
photoabsorption spectra. In the next section, we brieﬂy
recall the basic ingredients of the master equation ap-
proach, and we incorporate quantum corrections to the
equilibrium probabilities and rate constants. These cor-
rections are necessary for consistency with the previous
article.6 Before actually studying dynamical processes,
we construct and discuss disconnectivity graphs19,40 in
Sec. III. Such graphs are very helpful in elucidating the
role of the underlying PES on the kinetics. Disconnec-
tivity graphs are presented and discussed for the clus-
ters CaAr6, CaAr10, CaAr13, and CaAr37, which were
investigated in reference 6. Using the Gaussian theory of
absorption inspired by Wadi and Pollak,6,16 we calculate
the photoabsorption intensity of these clusters as a func-
tion of both time and excitation energy. The results are
given and analysed in Sec. IV, before we summarize and
conclude in Sec. V.

II. MASTER EQUATION DYNAMICS

In the master equation approach,17,18 the interbasin
dynamics on the energy landscape is described by the
time evolution of a vector, P(t), whose components are
the probabilities of the system residing in each of the
basins at time t. The diﬀerential equations governing
this evolution are

dPi
dt

= X
j6=i

[kij Pj(t) − kjiPi(t)] ,

(1)

where kij is the rate constant for transitions leading from
minimum j to minimum i. A transition matrix W is
deﬁned with components17,18,19

and Eq. (1) is solved analytically after symmetrization
and diagonalization of the matrix W.18,19 The rate con-
stant kij is the sum over all transition states separating
minima i and j:

kij = X

(4)

where kα
j is given by the usual Rice-Ramsperger-Kassel-

we have

Zj(T )

,

where kB and h are Boltzmann’s and Planck’s constants,
respectively. Z α
j and Zj are the partition functions corre-
sponding to the transition state α between i and j, and to
the minimum j, respectively. Here we use the harmonic
approximation to model both Z α
j and Zj, but we incorpo-
rate quantum corrections by employing the expressions
for quantum oscillators:

Zj(T ) =

In these expressions, hj (resp. hα

the point group of minimum j (resp. transition state α
between minima i and j). Ej and Eα
j are the energy of
these stationary points, and {ωjk} and {ωα
jk} are their
respective normal mode frequencies. ν = 3N − 6 is the
number of independent degrees of freedom of the cluster,
and β = 1/kBT . In the limit ¯h → 0, the rate constant
tends to its usual classical value

to a divergent rate. In this case the two minima cannot
be treated independently because of strong quantum de-
localization eﬀects. However, this situation should not
arise at high or moderate temperatures where kBT is
large compared to the zero-point energy, and this is the
regime of interest in the present work.

Application of the master equation approach requires
one to build a connected set of minima and the inter-
well transition states.19 To do this we used eigenvector-
following26 in conjunction with several methods to sam-
ple the local minima.19 For small clusters containing less
than 11 atoms, systematic searches were started from
the global minimum, and continued until no new minima
were found after searching for transition states along ev-
ery eigenvector of each minimum in the set. For these
systems the connected set of minima should be nearly

complete. For CaAr13, we expect the number of dis-
tinct local minima to be signiﬁcantly larger than in
Ar14, which itself possesses more than 104, excluding
permutation-inversion isomers. We decided to perform
only one cycle of systematic eigenvector-following transi-
tion state searches from each mode of every minimum in
the database collected for the study at thermodynamic
equilibrium.6

The situation becomes quite critical for CaAr37. As
was shown in our previous study,6 several minima with
diﬀerent structures coexist at low energy, and we were
not able to build a connected set containing all these
minima using one systematic eigenvector-following cy-
cle from the database obtained with parallel temper-
ing Monte Carlo. For this larger cluster, we selected
interest,
a small set of the low energy minima of
and we attempted to ﬁnd discrete pathways (series of
minima-transition states-minima) connecting them. To
do this we followed the method described in reference
14, where a connected path is built up using succes-
sive double-ended pathway searches. The nudged-elastic-
band approach27,28,29,30,31,32 was used to generate initial
guesses for transition states, which were then used as the
starting points for hybrid eigenvector-following transition
state searches33,34. These initial paths generally have
rather high barriers, and so the discrete path sampling
approach was then employed to provide a more realistic
account of the rates.14 These calculations also produce
connected databases of minima and transition states that
should provide a more appropriate picture of the dynam-
ics, either in visualisations using disconnectivity graphs,
or from master equation calculations. All the geometry
optimisations and pathway calculations were performed
with the OPTIM software package,19,37 for which we im-
plemented the pairwise potential describing the ground
state potential energy surface of CaArn clusters.38

III. ENERGY LANDSCAPES

A convenient way of visualizing complex energy land-
Such
scape is to construct a disconnectivity graph.
graphs were introduced by Becker and Karplus40 in their
study of a tetrapeptide. They have since been used in a
much wider context.19 Disconnectivity graphs show how
the minima of the PES are connected to each other and,
more importantly, what is the height of the barriers be-
tween these minima. Further details about the construc-
tion of disconnectivity graphs can be found in reference
19.

In the present work we have included zero-point en-
ergy corrections for the energies of the minima and tran-
sition states. Burnham et al. have previously found that
zero-point eﬀects change the appearance of disconnectiv-
ity graphs for the water hexamer signiﬁcantly.41 As noted
in the previous section, the zero-point terms sometimes
lead to the merging of two (and possibly more) minima.
However, such events were not observed in CaAr6, for

3

which we located twelve distinct minima and twenty tran-
sition states. The disconnectivity graph for this cluster is
shown in Fig. 1 along with the two lowest energy isomers.
According to the terminology introduced in reference 39,
this graph has a typical ‘palm tree’ character: the global
minimum lies at the bottom of a single funnel, and the
absence of large energy barriers is expected to permit
relatively fast relaxation toward equilibrium.

FIG. 2: Disconnectivity graph of the CaAr10 cluster. The
energies are in eV.

A similar picture was found for the larger cluster,
CaAr10, as shown in Fig. 2. In this case we located 391
distinct minima connected via 1831 transition states. At
the bottom of the funnel, the three lowest-energy minima
lie close together. They are all based on the incomplete
icosahedra, with diﬀerent substitional sites for the cal-
cium atom. As Fig. 2 shows, the two lowest minima are
extremely close in energy, and the energy barrier that
separates them is very small (less than 10−3 eV). Hence
these two isomers can barely be considered distinct.

The disconnectivity graph of CaAr13 is shown in Fig. 3.
The ‘palm tree’ character of this graph also suggests that
relatively fast relaxation should be possible to the global
minimum. However, the bottom of the funnel is slightly
rugged due to the presence of additional isomers with re-
spect to what would be expected for Ar14. The four ex-

FIG. 3: Disconnectivity graph of the CaAr13 cluster. The right panel shows the lower part of the graph and the secondary
funnel associated to changing the substitutional site of calcium in the capped icosahedron structure. All energies are in eV.

tra structures found by changing the substitutional site
of the calcium atom create a secondary side funnel. They
are close in energy to the global minimum, and are dis-
played in Fig. 3 next to a more detailed view of the corre-
sponding part of the graph. The ordering between these
isomers is straightforwardly explained by the weaker Ca–
Ar bond compared to Ar2. The lowest-energy barrier
between the global minimum and the next four isomers
lies about 2.19 × 10−3 eV/atom above isomer 1, which
is equivalent to a temperature of about 25 K. Below this
temperature we expect the relaxation to the global min-
imum to become signiﬁcantly slower due to trapping in
the secondary funnel.

Finally we consider the larger CaAr37 cluster. Starting
from the ten lowest minima in the database obtained by
systematic quenching along a parallel tempering Monte
Carlo trajectory,6 we were able to establish twenty con-
nected discrete pathways using the method described in
reference 14. New low-energy minima were discovered,
two of them lower than some in the initial set. Four
additional pathways were then constructed in the same
way. As mentioned above, these initial pathways found
may be far from optimal in terms of rates. The typical
initial path contained 30–40 minima and the disconnec-

tivity graph constructed just from the initial pathway
searches contained 731 distinct minima and 820 transi-
tion states. It is shown in Fig. 4, together with a selection
of low-energy structures chosen from the initial sample.
Clearly this graph does not show the single funnel aspect
of the previous clusters, and resembles more the ‘banyan
tree’ form.39

In fact, the energy landscape of CaAr37 is more com-
plicated than that of Ar38, which only has two main fun-
nels associated with truncated octahedral or icosahedral
structures, respectively. It is closer to the actual multi-
ple funnel shape of the disconnectivity graph in the ionic
cluster (NaCl)−
35.42 This increased complexity is due to
the larger number of isomers and possible binding sites
for calcium, and to the existence of a particularly stable
decahedral isomer. The stabilization of the anti-Mackay
icosahedral structures (isomer 4) due to zero-point eﬀects
is another complicating factor.7

The CaAr37 cluster exhibits several similarities with
Ar38, such as the nonicosahedral global minimum and
the multiple-funnel energy landscape. In thermal equi-
librium, the low-temperature behavior is essentially gov-
erned by the decahedral and Mackay-type icosahedral
minima.6 The truncated octahedral isomer is not ex-

pected to play a major role in the relaxation dynamics,
except if it contributes signiﬁcantly to the initial condi-
tions.

From Fig. 4 we see that the decahedral and Mackay
icosahedra isomers belong to the same superbasin at rel-
atively low energies. Hence we expect to ﬁnd signiﬁ-
cantly faster relaxation than in Ar38, where the trun-
cated octahedron and the icosahedra are much farther
apart in conﬁguration space, and separated by a rel-
atively high barrier. However, to obtain insight into
the relative stabilities of the isomers at the temperature
where relaxation is simulated, it may be helpful to in-
clude entropic eﬀects in the disconnectivity graphs.43,44
To achieve this goal we simply computed the free energies
of the minima and transition states instead of potential
energy minima, replacing Ej (Eα
j ) by Fj = −kBT ln Zj
(F α
j ), where the partition functions were
obtained in the harmonic approximation, and taken from
Eqn. (5,6).

j = −kBT ln Z α

The free-energy disconnectivity graph of CaAr37 at
T = 20 K is represented in Fig. 5. As can be clearly
seen on this ﬁgure, the most stable minimum at this tem-
perature is the anti-Mackay icosahedron isomer (4), and
the free energy barrier to the decahedral and Mackay-

icosahedral minima seems rather large. This change in
the most stable funnel with respect to the T = 0 discon-
nectivity graph should hinder relaxation, and we there-
fore anticipate particularly slow dynamics.

IV. RELAXATION TO EQUILIBRIUM:
TIME-DEPENDENT ABSORPTION SPECTRA

We now turn to the relaxation properties of CaArn
clusters resulting from the solution of the master equa-
tion. Two types of relaxation have been considered, ei-
ther starting from T = 0 (only the quantum global min-
imum is occupied) and moving to higher T , or starting
from a ﬁnite temperature equilibrium distribution and
changing to lower T . The equilibrium distributions were
calculated within the quantum harmonic superposition
approach applied to the same database of minima that
was used to construct the disconnectivity graphs, with-
out reweighting. For CaAr37, this procedure yields a
heat capacity peak corresponding to melting located at
about 25 K, slightly higher than the one obtained in the
more thorough previous study.6 For the other clusters the
harmonic approximation wthout reweighting performs

rather well.

FIG. 5: Free-energy disconnectivity graph of the CaAr37 clus-
ter, calculated at T = 20 K using harmonic quantum partition
functions. The isomers of Fig. 4 are represented. The energies
relative to the lowest free-energy minimum are in eV.

Here we focus on the photoabsorption spectrum as a
possible probe of cluster structure in a dynamical con-
text. The absorption intensity of the 4s2 → 4s14p1 ex-
citation for calcium was calculated using the Gaussian
theory adapted and extended from the work of Wadi
and Pollak.6,16 The excited state potential energy sur-
faces were modelled by a diatomics-in-molecules (DIM)
Hamiltonian, which was fully described in Ref. 38.

We ﬁrst show in Fig. 6 the time evolution of the ab-
sorption spectrum of CaAr6, starting at t = 0 from the
zero temperature distribution, and relaxing at T = 25 K,
slightly above the melting point.6 The spectrum remains
essentially doubly-peaked, and at very small times t <
5 ps the red peak can be separated into two distinct
lines characteristic of the ground state isomer. The blue
wing of this peak soon becomes a shoulder. These results
correspond to fast relaxation, which barely has a spec-
troscopic signature. Such simple dynamics is perfectly
consistent with the energy landscape of this cluster, as
seen from its disconnectivity graph. In the upper panel
of Fig. 6, the characteristic time constants, τi, of the rate

matrix W are represented on a horizontal axis, for both
the quantum and classical regimes. They are calculated
from the nonzero eigenvalues, λi, of W as τi = −1/λi. At
25 K, the largest time constant is a few tens of picosec-
onds, which is roughly in agreement with the observed
decay of the spectroscopic signal, although the experi-
mental relaxationis faster, by about one order of magni-
tude, than the slowest time constant τmax. Such quanti-
tative discrepancies are typical of the errors that simple
rate theories based upon harmonic densities of states are
expected to introduce. Quantum eﬀects are small in this
system and the relaxation kinetics for CaAr10 were found
to be very similar, so detailed discussion is omitted.

Relaxation from a zero temperature distribution has
also been investigated in CaAr13 for a temperature jump
to T = 40 K, which lies close to the melting point of
this cluster.6 At this temperature, the occupation prob-
ability of the secondary funnel is quite large. The time-
dependent spectrum in Fig. 7 indeed exhibits a transi-
tion from the ground state, identiﬁed by two absorption
peaks, to vibrationally excited isomers and the three-
peak pattern characteristic of calcium located in the
icosahedral shell.6 Monitoring the time-dependent signal

FIG. 7: Photoabsorption spectrum of CaAr13 during the re-
laxation from the T = 0 distribution toward the T = 40 K
equilibrium distribution. The continuous distributions [in the
quantum (Q) and classical (C) regimes] of the characteristic
times of the transition matrix W are represented on a decimal
logarithmic scale, on the horizontal axis in the upper part of
the ﬁgure.

shows that relaxation typically occurs on a 50 ps time
scale, which is again one order of magnitude faster than
τmax in this system, as seen in the upper part of Fig. 7.
At T = 20 K, the global minimum of CaAr13 is pre-
dicted to have an equilibrium occupation probability
larger than 90%,6 hence the next metastable isomers play
only a minor role in the thermodynamic properties. Re-
laxation from a high temperature distribution (50 K) has
also been simulated using the master equation approach.
The time-dependent absorption spectrum is plotted in
Fig. 8 along with the distribution of characteristic decay
times from the rate matrix. The variations observed in
the spectrum are in clear contrast with the previous re-
sults. During the ﬁrst 100 ps, the cluster relaxes from
a broad distribution of isomers towards the main fun-
nel that corresponds to the capped icosahedron. As in-
dicated by the two-peak absorption spectrum, the sec-
ondary funnel has a larger occupation probability about
5 ns after the dynamics has started. The cluster then ﬁ-
nally relaxes to its equilibrium distribution following sin-
gle exponential kinetics, characterized by a rather large
time constant of about 105 ps. This value is still one order
of magnitude faster than the calculated τmax ≈ 106 ps,

7

represented in the upper part of Fig. 8. The two-step re-
laxation process observed here can be easily interpreted
thanks to the disconnectivity graph in Fig. 3. The sec-
ondary funnel constitutes a kinetic trap, resulting in a
signiﬁcant slowing down of the dynamics. While the clus-
ter easily ﬁnds its way into this secondary funnel, escape
to the global minimum is much slower due to the rather
large energy barrier. In agreement with previous work,
this multiple-funnel landscape exhibits a separation of
timescales in its dynamics.19,39

We ﬁnally discuss the case of CaAr37, for which we
solved the master equation at T = 20 K, starting from
the T = 0 initial distribution. The magnitude of the
characteristic decay times, as computed from the eigen-
values of the rate matrix, are remarkably large, reach-
ing values close to one second. The calculated absorp-
tion spectrum is shown in Fig. 9 as a function of time.
The choice of a logarithmic scale emphasizes the diﬀer-
ent time scales present in this system. The multiple fun-
nels of the energy landscape are in competition below
20 K, and the cluster undergoes multiple transitions be-
fore reaching equilibrium. As we deduced from the free
energy disconnectivity graph in Fig. 5, relaxation from 0
to 20 K in this system requires the cluster to escape from
its initial decahedral/icosahedral funnel. At least four
signiﬁcant changes in behaviour are detected through ab-
sorption spectroscopy, after 102, 106, 1010, and 1012 ps,
respectively. The transient regime thus appears particu-
larly slow, in a similar way to the dynamics observed in
Ar38.8 The spectra in Fig. 9 show that some intermediate
minima, which are too high in energy to be signiﬁcantly
occupied at equilibrium, may still contribute to the spec-
trum as transient species with a long lifetime.

For CaAr37 the set of connected minima was initially
constructed in a rather artiﬁcial manner by means of di-
rect pathway searches. As mentioned in the previous
section, these initial paths are usually rather long and
correspond to high barriers. Therefore the interconver-
sion rates predicted using this database are probably un-
realistic and much too low. The discrete path sampling
technique14 was therefore used to optimize the pathway
between the two lowest decahedral and Mackay icosahe-
dral minima. We found pathways containing fewer than
seven minima (including the two end points) with a rate
constant about eight orders of magnitude larger than that
of the initial 45-step pathway. This improvement is even
more impressive than the one found for Ar38.14 However,
in CaAr37 the distance between the two minima in ques-
tion is rather shorter, because they belong to the same
funnel.

We did not attempt to optimize the 23 other initial
pathways using the discrete path sampling method, since
the eﬀect of reﬁning the interconversion pathways is not
expected to aﬀect the complex variation with time of the
absorption intensity.

V. CONCLUSIONS

periments?

The complexity of the energy landscapes of CaArn
clusters is reﬂected not only on their equilibrium prop-
erties, but also in their relaxation kinetics. By employ-
ing the master equation approach, quantum corrected
harmonic partition functions and the Gaussian theory of
absorption,16 we have investigated the time-dependence
of the photoabsorption intensity. The clusters were cho-
sen to provide a selection of various ﬁnite-size eﬀects.
Our main result is that spectroscopy may be able to
probe the isomerization of a given cluster in real time,
and provide estimates of the interconversion rates them-
selves. We have found evidence that CaArn clusters can
display simple kinetics (as in CaAr6 or CaAr10), two-
state kinetics and trapping in auxiliary funnels (aAr13),
or more intricate kinetics and multiple transient regimes
(CaAr37), all with a distinct spectroscopic signature. ex-

A number of approximations have been used to achieve
these results, including the harmonic superposition ap-
proximation using incomplete samples of minima for the
larger clusters. The master equation approach also con-
tains some assumptions, such as local equilibrium in-
side each basin and Markovian dynamics. Finally, the
Gaussian theory of absorption also contains some ap-
proximations. Because of these restrictions, our inves-
tigation may be semi-quantitative with respect to actual
CaArn clusters, even before we allow for the approximate
nature of the Hamiltonians used to model the ground-
and excited-state potential energy surfaces.38 Neverthe-
less, the present study provides the next step beyond the
analysis of equilibrium properties discussed in our previ-
ous paper.6 We believe that it further supports the need
for future experiments on size-selected, trapped clusters
studied via spectroscopic techniques.

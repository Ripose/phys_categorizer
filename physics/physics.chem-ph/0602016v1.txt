Abstract. The paper reports an exact solution for the problem of spin evolution of radical ion
pair in static magnetic and resonant microwave ﬁeld taking into account Zeeman and hyperﬁne
interactions and spin relaxation. The values of parameters that provide one of the four possible
types of solution are analysed. It is demonstrated that in the absence of spin relaxation, besides
the zero ﬁeld invariant an invariant at large amplitudes of the resonant microwave ﬁeld can be
found. The two invariants open the possibility for simple calculation of microwave pulses to
control quantum state of the radical pair. The effect of relaxation on the invariants is analysed
and it is shown that changes in the high ﬁeld invariant are induced by phase relaxation.

Time evolution of spin state of radical ion pair in microwave ﬁeld

1. Introduction

The problem of controlling elementary chemical reactions, and especially the advances in
the ﬁeld of quantum informatics [1] stimulate interest towards controlling quantum state of
microscopic spin systems [2]. Spin correlated radical pairs are one of the most intriguing
quantum objects. The quantum state of such a pair can be controlled by applying external
magnetic ﬁelds [3, 4]. Additional application of resonant microwave ﬁelds substantially
widens the possibilities for manipulating the spins.

A resonant microwave ﬁeld induces transitions between the triplet states, which leads to

is higher than between the triplet states, periodic changes of the singlet state population with
frequency proportional to amplitude of the microwave ﬁeld are observed, which is referred to
as quantum oscillations [10, 11, 12]. In the opposite limiting case of strong microwave ﬁeld,

observed. As was demonstrated [13] for pairs formed in singlet initial spin state a strong
microwave ﬁeld only slows down singlet-triplet transitions but does not completely block
them, and the population of
state always remains low. This was suggested as a possible
route to control spin state of such a pair. If the microwave ﬁeld is switched off at the moment
when the population of the singlet state is minimal, most pairs will be trapped in the
and
states. The only way to get into the singlet state for them is spin-lattice relaxation. A

similar idea was exploited to experimentally substantially prolong lifetime of the radical pair
in photosynthetic reaction center [14] by transferring it into its
states. Another
route to control spin state of the pair was found theoretically in the work [15]. If a strong
resonant microwave ﬁeld is rapidly switched on at the moment when spin system is in its
state, the pair is completely locked in triplet state and will never become singlet through

dynamic transitions. A possibility of controlling spin state of the pair with very short pulses
of very strong microwave ﬁeld has also been treated theoretically [16]. The theory shows that
quantum beats in radical pair can be controlled with two (for singlet-born pairs) or just one
(for triplet-born pairs) short microwave pulses.

The already cited works [13, 15] treated spin dynamics of a radical pair in static magnetic
and resonant microwave ﬁelds neglecting relaxation. A method for solving the problem of
spin dynamics taking into account relaxation was developed in work [12], and approximate
solutions in the two limiting cases of large and small splitting were obtained. A method for
numerical solution of this problem taking into account relaxation and ion-molecular charge
transfer reaction was developed in work [17]. In the present contribution we provide a general
analytical solution for the problem of spin evolution of a radical ion pair taking into account
spin relaxation and use it to analyse the characteristic features of time evolution of the pair
spin state in microwave ﬁeld.

Let us consider what happens when a non-polar solution is irradiated by ionizing radiation.
As an example we shall use liquid hydrocarbons (RH), in which ionizing irradiation in the
presence of electron (A) and hole acceptors (D) initiates the processes which in turn lead

molecules (1A∗ and 1D∗) produced by recombination emit a quantum of light that is detected
by experimental setup. The intensity of the detected luminescence is thus proportional to
probability of forming singlet excited molecules upon recombination. The effects of magnetic
ﬁelds on recombination luminescence have as their origin spin evolution in geminate pairs and
dependence of the yield of luminescence on the multiplicity of excited molecule formed by
recombination.

An important advantage of non-polar solutions is that the initial inter-partner distance in
6 nm) is substantially lower than Onsager radius
the pairs after ionization (normally
(
30 nm for alkanes at room temperature). The overwhelming majority of the pairs thus
∼
recombine as geminate pairs, i.e., with their sibling counter ion. Upon ionization of molecule
the spin of the ejected electron does not change its state. Since in the molecule the spins were
paired, the initial spin state of the geminate pair is always singlet. Charge transfer to acceptors
and charge recombination also do not change spin states. This means that the multiplicity
of the excited molecule formed by recombination is determined by the multiplicity of the

÷

recombining pair immediately before recombination. The multiplicity of the excited molecule
is thus determined by spin evolution of the geminate radical ion pair between the moments
of ionization and recombination. Static or oscillating magnetic ﬁelds can substantially affect
this evolution. And ﬁnally, as excited molecules normally emit light from their singlet excited
state, any effect of magnetic ﬁelds on the spin state of the pair is directly reﬂected in the
intensity of recombination luminescence.

In liquid non-polar solution the partners of the pair formed by irradiation spend almost
the entire period of time from ionization and up to recombination at substantial distances
from each other (tens of nanometers), as their approach to distances about 1–2 nm leads to
practically instant recombination. Thus dipole-dipole and exchange interactions between the
pair partners can be safely neglected. Spin evolution of the pair in this case is driven by
interaction of electron spin with spins of nuclei (hyperﬁne interaction, HFI), with external
magnetic ﬁelds, and by spin relaxation processes.

Spin Hamiltonian for radical pair consisting of radicals A and D in high static magnetic

ﬁeld B0 and microwave ﬁled with magnetic component B1(t) can be written as follows:

where ˆSA and ˆSD are spin operators for electrons, and ˆI A
j are spin operators for
magnetic nuclei in radicals A and D respectively. The sum runs over the nuclei of radicals.
The ﬁrst term describes Zeeman interaction of electron spins with external magnetic ﬁeld, the
second and third terms correspond to isotropic hyperﬁne interaction of electron spins with
nuclear spins in the two radicals. The z axis is aligned along the direction of the ﬁeld B0. For
simplicity we assume that the partners of the pair have identical g-values (gA = gD = g).

i and ˆI D

As was shown in work [12] in the presence of spin relaxation time evolution of the spin
operators for the partners of the radical pair ˆSA(t) and ˆSD(t) is describe with a system of
equations in the frame rotating at the frequency of the applied microwave ﬁeld that are similar
to Bloch equations [20, 21]. For operator ˆSA(t) the system is written as:

2.2. Solution of the system of operator equations

Equations (2a)–(2c) are a system of homogeneous linear differential equations, and its
solution can be represented as an expansion over a complete orthonormal basis. In our case
such a basis is conveniently given by Pauli matrices ˆσx, ˆσy, and ˆσz.

The system (2a)–(2c) was solved by Laplace transform and its inversion along the lines
of the work [22]. A substantial difference from [22] is that in our case the equations are solved
for operators, but this does not change the basic approach.

Laplace transform of the original equations yields the following system:
(p + 1/T2)ˆ˜Sx + ∆ω ˆ˜Sy = ˆSx(0),
ˆ˜Sz = ˆSy(0),
ˆ˜Sy + (p + 1/T1)ˆ˜Sz = ˆSz(0),

where the tilde sign denotes Laplace transforms of the corresponding spin operators, p is the
Laplace parameter. This system is a system of linear algebraic equations with three unknowns,
which has a unique solution when its determinant is nonzero

Figure 2(a) shows time dependencies of the sum of populations of the singlet

and
states of the system at different magnitudes of B1. The line of one radical is
the triplet
precisely in resonance with the applied microwave ﬁeld, and the line of the other partner is
detuned by 0.3 mT. Initial state of the pair was taken to be singlet, i.e. ρss = 1, all other
ρij = 0. For Figure 2 and all next ﬁgures are true ∆BA,D = ~∆ωA,D/(gβ). As the ﬁgure
shows, in this case even a weak microwave ﬁeld is sufﬁcient to completely destroy invariant
(25). The reason for this is transitions between
states induced by resonant
microwave ﬁeld. As a consequence the value of ρss(t) + ρzz(t) periodically changes from
zero to one. The population of the singlet state also changes periodically (see Figure 7). This
phenomenon is referred to as quantum oscillations and has been observed experimentally
[10, 11, 12] and studied theoretically [13, 12]. The changes in the frequency of oscillations
with increasing amplitude of the microwave ﬁeld are not monotonous. The frequency ﬁrst
increases but then, as B1 grows substantially larger than the splitting between the lines of the
two radicals, falls down. The decrease of the frequency is related to the effect of spin locking.
Figure 2(b) shows time dependences ρss(t) + ρzz(t) in the situation of strong detuning
of the microwave frequency from resonance. Time scale is expanded three ﬁve times with
respect to Figure 2(a). As is clear from the ﬁgure, in this case for not too large amplitudes of
the microwave ﬁeld the frequency of oscillations substantially increases as compared to the
case of resonance with accompanying decrease in the amplitude of the oscillations.

This effect can be observed experimentally. Figure 3 shows experimental results on
monitoring kinetics of recombination ﬂuorescence from liquid alkane solutions in the absence
and in the presence of microwave ﬁeld. The experimental technique that was used to get

(A), and deuterated para-terphenyl PTP
d14 as the hole acceptor (D). ESR spectrum of
d14 radical cation is a single inhomogeneously broadened line with width about 0.1 mT.
PTP
Radical anion of C6F6 has a wide resolved spectrum with hyperﬁne coupling constant of
about 13.5 mT with six equivalent ﬂuorine nuclei [23]. Time dependence of the intensity
of recombination ﬂuorescence I(t) was sampled using single photon counting technique.
The observed light in this case mostly comes from excited PTP
d14 molecules. Since
recombination kinetics f (t) does not depend on the multiplicity of the pair, and ﬂuorescence
intensity is proportional to singlet state population of the pair at the moment of recombination
f (t)ρss(t). The equality becomes more accurate as
ρss(t), we can write that I(t)
ﬂuorescence time of the luminophore shortens (about 1 ns for PTP
d14) and time resolution
of the experimental setup improves (about 3 ns in our case). In these conditions time resolved

in work [12], it is proportional to t3/4.

As Figure 2(b) shows for large magnitudes of B1 in the case of detuning from
resonance the frequency of oscillations also decreases, but this happens at larger amplitudes
of microwave ﬁeld than in the conditions of resonance and is accompanied with increasing
amplitude of the oscillations.

As Figure 4 shows, the behaviour of these curves qualitatively differs from the curves of
Figure 2. An increase in the amplitude of microwave ﬁeld leads to increased frequency and
decreased amplitude of the oscillations. Such a behaviour of the calculated curves reﬂects the
existence of the high ﬁeld invariant (30). It can be noted that the accuracy of conserving the
value of ρss(t) + ρxx(t) at small splitting is rather high already for microwave ﬁeld amplitudes
easily accessible in experiment. The magnitudes of B1 amplitudes required for conserving the
high ﬁeld invariant increase in the case of detuning from resonance (or increasing the value
of ∆ω).

For singlet initial state of the pair and sufﬁciently large magnitude of B1 the sum of
populations ρss(t) + ρxx(t) oscillate close to one, as can be seen from Figure 4, which is in
good agreement with equation (30). In a more general case (18), when initial singlet state
population ρss(0) is equal to cos2 θ, the sum of populations ρss(t) + ρxx(t) should oscillate
close to this value cos2 θ. The correctness of this conclusion is demonstrated by the results
of calculations given in Figure 5, which shows time dependences of the sum of populations
states of the system for different initial conditions (18).

The curves that are shown in this ﬁgure correspond to several sets of values of θ and φ. As
can be clearly seen, the curves in fact oscillate close to the level of cos2 θ. The frequency of
these oscillations is indeed close to ω1, and their amplitude depends on φ.

3.2. On possibility to control spin state of the radical ion pair

The existence of invariants (25) and (30) signiﬁcantly simpliﬁes analysis of spin evolution of
radical ion pairs in the absence of microwave ﬁeld and in strong microwave ﬁelds. This opens
important possibilities for controlled impact on the pair to manipulate its spin state.

AD/2ω1, where ∆ωAD = ωA

As was demonstrated in [15], the existence of the high ﬁeld invariant (30) allows in
principle to perform ”true spin locking”. Upon rapid application of a strong microwave
ﬁeld at the moment when the pair is in its triplet
state the system is “locked” in triplet
state and cannot get into singlet state. At the same time for singlet initial state the system
cannot be completely “locked”, and singlet state population oscillates at a frequency close
to ∆ω2
ωD, where ωA and ωD are resonance frequencies for
radicals A and D respectively [13]. This effect is made absolutely clear by the existence of
the high ﬁeld invariant (30). For singlet initial state the sum of populations ρss(t) + ρxx(t)
is equal to 1 all the time, and the populations ρss(t) and ρxx(t) change in antiphase with
frequency ∆ω2
always remains very close to zero
also remains
[13, 15]. From the invariant (30) it follows that the population of the state
zero. For triplet initial state
the sum of populations ρss(t) and ρxx(t) remains zero all the
time, which means that populations ρss(t) and ρxx(t) remain zero.

3.3. The effect of relaxation

The above considerations are valid only in the absence of spin relaxation, which destroys spin
invariants. The zero microwave ﬁeld invariant (25) is apparently destroyed by spin-lattice
relaxation. Phase relaxation does not affect this invariant. This means that expression (25)
holds true only for times substantially smaller than T1. The effect of relaxation on the high
ﬁeld invariant (30) is much less obvious. Figure 6 shows transformations of time dependence
for the sum of populations of the singlet
states of the pair with changing

In the absence of relaxation because of invariant (30) the total
population of ρss(t) and ρxx(t) should oscillate close to zero. However the ﬁgure shows that
this is no longer the case. The total population increases with time, and the time scale of

this increase is close to the phase relaxation time T2. We conclude it is phase relaxation that
causes the destruction of the high ﬁeld invariant (30).

Figure 7 shows time dependences of the populations of different states in the cases of

weak and strong microwave ﬁeld in the presence of phase relaxation.

The time of spin-lattice relaxation T1 in this model calculation is taken to be very large,

so it has practically no effect on the obtained curves.

As Figure 7 shows, time proﬁle of the populations of different states are qualitatively
different upon application of weak and strong microwave ﬁelds.
In a weak ﬁeld ρss(t)
and ρzz(t) oscillate in antiphase with frequency close to ∆ωAD. The amplitude of these
oscillations drops because of phase relaxation, and ρss(t) and ρzz(t) asymptotically approach
each other. The sum of populations ρxx(t) + ρyy(t) in this case is a more smooth curve, which
is periodically modulated with frequency close to ω1.

In a strong microwave ﬁeld we see the manifestations of spin locking. Singlet state
population ρss(t) oscillates at a frequency about ∆ω similar to the weak ﬁeld case, but the
amplitude of these oscillations is rather small. Oscillations of substantial amplitude occur
at a frequency about ∆ω2
AD/2ω1. This is also the frequency, at which changes the sum of
populations ρxx(t) + ρyy(t). The population of the triplet state
increases with the time of
phase relaxation T2.

4. Conclusions

First of all we note that all these results were obtained in the case of ﬁxed nuclear
conﬁgurations in both partners of the pair. In the presence of the reaction of ion-molecular
charge transfer this condition is no longer observed, but this apparently does not change the
zero microwave ﬁeld invariant (25). The high microwave ﬁeld invariant (30) will also remain
valid if the condition ∆ω/ω1

1 is not violated in the course of the reaction.

Let us formulate the main rules for spin evolution of a radical pair that follow from the

invariant (30) is destroyed by phase relaxation.

The two invariants that we found suggest a way of controlling transitions between spin
states of a radical pair. One possible variant of controlling quantum spin state would be a
rapid switching of a strong microwave ﬁeld on and off. In this case the pair will alternatively
be in the conditions when one of the invariants is conserved. Another possible control option
may be a rapid change in the phase of the microwave ﬁeld by π/2. In this case the axes x and

Appendix B. The values of parameters that lead to certain types of solution for
equations of spin dynamics

To analyse the different cases of spin dynamics it would be very useful to have simple rules
for determining the type of solution for the equations with the given set of parameters. As it
turned out, these rules can be easily formulated, which will be done in this section.

As has been shown earlier, the exact analytical solution for the equations of spin
dynamics can belong to one of four types: oscillatory, overdamped, and two degenerate,
depending in the ﬁrst place on the value of ξ.

To simplify further treatment let us introduce the new parameter:

1/T1.
Since T2 6 T1 in all cases, z > 0.

z = 1/T2

−

It turns out that relaxation times T1 and T2 enter the expressions for q, s and ξ (8)-(10)

(cid:3)

This means that the type of the sought solution depends only on the differences in the rates of
spin-spin and spin-lattice relaxation, but not on the absolute values of the two rates.

As can be seen from expression (B.1), ξ is a quadratic function with respect to z2, with
branches of the parabola going upwards. This means that in the absence of real roots ξ is
positive for all values of z. If the roots exist ξ is negative for values of z2 in-between the roots
and is positive for z2 outside this range.

From ξ = 0 it follows:

The solutions exist for ω1 > 2√2∆ω. It can be easily shown that both roots are positive.

From this we conclude that ξ > 0 either for ω1 < 2√2∆ω, or for ω1 > 2√2∆ω when
”
−

z < z2 or z > z1 (z1 corresponds to choice of “+” in (B.2), and z2 to the choice of “
respectively). In this case we obtain a solution of the oscillatory type.

ξ < 0 for ω1 > 2√2∆ω in the range z2 < z < z1. This set of parameters produces a

solution of the overdamped type.

For ξ = 0, when either z = z1 or z = z2 we have a solution of the degenerate type.
Finally, when simultaneously ξ = 0 and q = 0 the case of double degeneracy takes place.

It can be easily shown that this occurs for ω1 = 2√2∆ω and z = 3√3∆ω.

Especially interesting is the behaviour of the solution in the vicinity of resonance for
0. Small parameter expansion of (B.2) then

yields:

Thus close to the resonance line an oscillatory solution will be obtained for ω1 > 1

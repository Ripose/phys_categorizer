The potential proﬁle across a biased molecular junction is calculated within the framework of a
simple Thomas–Fermi type screening model. In particular, the relationship between this proﬁle and
the lateral molecular cross section is examined. We ﬁnd that a transition from a linear potential
proﬁle to a potential that drops mainly near the molecule-metal contacts occurs with increasing
cross section width, in agreement with numerical quantum calculations.

INTRODUCTION

Molecular wires are molecules that bridge between
metallic leads to form a nano-conductor whose current-
voltage characteristic reﬂects the electronic structure of
the molecule. The conductance may be controlled via
its dependence on molecular properties. Equally impor-
tant is the use of such molecular junctions as capacitive
elements in nano-electronics.

Understanding the behavior of such junctions under
potential bias is a prerequisite for elucidating their trans-
port properties. The importance of this issue for the
conductance of molecular junctions was recently empha-
sized by Datta and coworkers [1, 2], who have shown,
within a simple Extended-H¨uckel (EH) model for α,α′-
xylyl dithiol bridging between two gold leads, that the
potential proﬁle (imposed on the molecule as input to
the EH calculation) had a profound eﬀect on quantitative
as well as qualitative aspects of the calculated current-
voltage characteristic. The best ﬁt to experimental re-
sults was obtained from a model that assumed (a) a ﬂat
potential proﬁle in the interior of the molecular bridge,
i.e. the potential drop occurs only at the molecule-lead
contacts and (b) a symmetric distribution of the poten-
tial drop at the two contacts, i.e.
for a total voltage Φ
the potential drops at each molecular edge by Φ/2.

This picture is supported by a recent model calcula-
tion by Mujica et al. [3], where the Schr¨odinger equation
(on the Hartree level) was solved in conjunction with the
Poisson equation to yield both the electronic structure
and the spatial distribution of the electrostatic potential
[4]. It was found that beyond a screening distance of the
order of 1–3 atomic lengths the potential is ﬂat along the
model molecular chain.

Ab initio calculations with open system boundary con-
ditions reveal a diﬀerent picture: Lang and Avouris [5]
have found for a chain of seven carbon atoms connect-
ing between jellium leads that a substantial part of the
voltage drop occurs along the carbon chain itself. Damle
et al. [6] have obtained similar results for a chain of gold
atoms as well as for a molecular wire — phenyl-dithiol
bridging between two gold electrodes [7]. In an earlier
work, Pernas et al. [8] have determined that the poten-
tial along a model molecular wire is ﬂat in the absence
of scattering centers, however these authors have derived

the local potential from a questionable local charge neu-
trality condition.

Recently, Weber et al. [9] have considered the volt-
age proﬁle across 9,10-Bis((2’-para-mercaptophenyl)-
ethinyl)-anthracene coupled to two Au29 clusters. Their
density functional theory calculations thus go beyond the
assumption of a structureless metallic electrode and take
into account the speciﬁc properties of the bond between
the molecule and the gold atom in its local environment.
On the experimental side, Bachtold et al. [10] have
used scanned probe microscopy of both single-walled and
multi-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNT and MWNT, re-
spectively) to measure the potential drop along such nan-
otubes connecting between two gold electrodes. They
ﬁnd an approximately linear drop of the potential in a
MWNT of diameter 9nm while for a metallic SWNT bun-
dle of diameter 2.5nm the potential is ﬂat beyond the
screening regions at the tube edges. It should be empha-
sized that these experiments cannot be related directly to
the calculations discussed above. The nanotube length is
a few microns and impurity and defect scattering may be
eﬀective as is most certainly the case in the MWNT mea-
surement. The ﬂat potential seen in the metallic SWNT
measurement is in fact a remarkable observation imply-
ing a very long mean free path (> 1µm) for electrons in
these room temperature structures.

It is clear from the studies described above that while
the computational methodology for evaluating the poten-
tial distribution on a biased molecular wire is available,
a complete understanding of the way this distribution
behaves in diﬀerent wires is lacking. In this respect sim-
ple models that focus on generic properties of conducting
constrictions including molecular wires are useful. The
calculations of Pernas et al. [8] provide such a model that
is however hampered, as already stated by the restriction
of local charge neutrality. The calculation of Mujica et al.
[3] is also based on a generic molecular model, however,
by using a 1-dimensional Poisson equation for the electro-
static potential these authors tacitly assume a molecular
bridge whose lateral dimension is much larger than the
screening length. In view of the fact that the width of
molecular wires is often just a few angstroms, such an
assumption is overly restrictive. Clearly, the magnitudes
of the lateral width of the wire and the screening length
should be important generic quantities for this issue. In

FIG. 1: The general setup contains a molecular wire modeled

conductors with potentials Φ1 and Φ2.

this paper we present a simple model calculation that
takes the relative magnitudes of these variables explic-
itly into account. We describe the model in Section II,
present the calculation in Section III and some results
and discussion in Section IV.

II. THE MODEL

The molecular wire is modeled as a cylinder of length
L and diameter of order σ (the exact way in which σ en-
ters into the model calculation is explained below), per-
pendicular to and connecting between two planar metal
electrode surfaces. As depicted in Fig. 1, the cylinder is
oriented parallel to the z axis, with its axis going through
the origin in the xy plane. The two electrodes are as-
sumed to be ideal conductors implying a constant poten-
tial on the entire surface of each electrode. We set the
potentials at the left and right wire-electrode interface
to be Φ1 = ∆/2 and Φ2 = −∆/2, respectively. In view
of (2) below, this guarantees a vanishing mean potential
in z-direction and thus a neutral molecule. Finally, we
restrict the discussion of the potential proﬁle to block-
ing junctions between electrodes and molecule so that no
current is ﬂowing.

As in Ref. [3] we assume that the wire material does
have screening capacity, and is characterized by a screen-
It should be noted that the existence,
ing length λ.
nature and size of such screening length in molecular
systems is an open question with probably non-unique
answer. Molecules with large gaps between their high-
est occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals
(HOMO and LUMO) will obviously screen poorly, while
highly conjugated molecules with low HOMO-LUMO gap
will screen relatively well.

In the present discussion we assume that over the rel-
evant length scales (of order L) screening is described by
a Poisson equation

According to the cylinder symmetry of the molecule, the
charge density ρ(rk, z) depends on the radial distance rk
from the wire axis and the position z along the wire. In
transversal direction, the charge density is assumed to
be determined by a given molecular electron distribution
represented by a factor F (rk). The longitudinal part de-
pends on the potential along the molecular axis. The
screening is then described by

4πρ(rk, z) = −

1
λ2 F (rk)Φ(0, z)

(2)

which together with (1) will allow us to determine the
potential proﬁle.

Any assumption about the functional form of F (rk)
is in fact an assumption about the conﬁnement of the
molecular charge distribution in the molecular cylinder
and in our generic model it is suﬃcient to take a form
that reﬂects the molecular thickness σ. Other details of
F (rk) are expected to be of secondary importance.

At metallic electron densities λ is typically of the order
of 1 ˚A. To have eﬃcient screening in a molecular system
electrons (or holes) must occupy molecular states that
are eﬀectively delocalized over the length of the bridge.
Charge doping by transfer from the metal electrode to
the molecular bridge may be one source of such elec-
trons. Their density is expected to be considerably lower
than metallic, implying a larger characteristic screening
length. We expect that a calculation based on (1) and
(2) that uses metallic electron density to estimate λ will
provide an upper bound on the eﬀective screening in a
molecular wire.

problem is to solve the equation

IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

We now address the dependence of the potential pro-
ﬁle on the width of the molecular wire and start with
the limiting case of an inﬁnitely thick molecule or, equiv-
alently, a large number of molecules in parallel present
between the two electrodes. Then, F (rk) = 1 and one

In the
limit of very small screening length, λ → 0, it is possible
to show by evaluating the sum in (13) that the potential
along the wire vanishes and the entire voltage drop occurs
at the interface with the electrodes.

This result is shown in Fig. 2 as uppermost curve. In the
limit of very large screening length, λ → ∞, δ vanishes,
thereby indicating the expected linear voltage drop. On
the other hand, for very short screening length, λ →
0, δ approaches one and the entire voltage drops at the
interfaces between wire and electrode.

The thickness parameter σ/L takes the values 0.0125, 0.05,

containing almost a plateau.

For the case of ﬁnite width, we employ the Gaussian

charge distribution

F (rk) = exp(−r

(21)

This function is not normalized and therefore describes
a charge distribution with a density in the center inde-
pendent of the width σ. Such a situation arises when the
diameter of a molecular layer can be controlled. Then,
the charge density in the center appears in the screen-
ing length λ.
In contrast, in the somewhat unrealistic
case where the charge density on the wire is changed, the
function F (rk) would have to be normalized.

One advantage of the Gaussian distribution (21) is the
fact that the coeﬃcients (14) may still be expressed an-
alytically in terms of an exponential integral

With this result the potential proﬁle can be evaluated
numerically according to (13) while the deviation from
the linear voltage drop is obtained from (16).

In Fig. 2, the deviation δ of the voltage proﬁle from
the linear behavior (8) is shown for diﬀerent values of
the wire thickness σ. The uppermost curve corresponds
to the limit of a thick molecular layer σ → ∞ which was
discussed above. The three other curves correspond to
σ/L = 0.05, 0.02, and 0.01 from top to bottom. As these
results demonstrate, a reduction of σ causes a reduction
of δ indicating that the voltage proﬁle approaches the
linear voltage drop. This behavior can be understood
in terms of a reduction of screening due to the reduced

molecular layer. However, this eﬀect becomes only rel-
evant for σ ≪ L. As discussed above, the limit λ → 0
leads to a constant potential along the molecular wire.
Therefore, all curves shown in Fig. 2 tend to δ = 1 in
this limit even though this is not shown in the ﬁgure.

We now turn to a discussion of the voltage proﬁles
themselves. Figure 3 depicts results obtained from (13)
using Fn from (22) and Φ0(z) as deﬁned in (8). The
dimensionless screening length λ/L = 0.05 implies for a
typical metallic screening length λ = 2 a.u. a wire length
of L = 20 a.u.. The thickness parameter σ/L for the
three diﬀerent curves are 0.0125, 0.05, and 0.5, where the
voltage proﬁle becomes more and more linear as σ de-
creases. As already mentioned, this may be understood
in terms of the reduced screening. Fig. 4 shows similar
results for a wire with a ratio between the typical di-
ameter and the wire length of σ/L = 0.125. Here, the
dimensionless screening length takes the decreasing val-
ues λ/L = 0.25, 0.1, and 0.05 with increasing deviation
from the linear voltage proﬁle.

In Fig. 5 we present a ﬁt of our voltage proﬁle to the ab
initio calculation of Ref. [6]. A least square ﬁt resulted
in a screening length of λ/L = 0.052 and a wire width of
σ/L = 0.032. For a distance L of approximately 34 a.u.,
this yields the reasonable value of 1.1 a.u. for the radial
extent of the electron density.

The parameters σ/L and λ/L employed allow for a
rather good approximation of the results of the ab ini-
tio calculation. However, there are two signiﬁcant dif-
ferences. The Friedel oscillations found in the quan-
tum calculation cannot be obtained within our classical
approach.
In a tight-binding model description of the
molecular wire, Friedel oscillations naturally arise from
a breaking of electron-hole symmetry [11]. Secondly, the
systematic shift between the two voltage proﬁles in Fig. 5
indicates that the wire in the ab initio calculation was

walled carbon nanotubes of thickness ∼ 20 a.u. is con-
sistent with the results shown in Fig. 3. One should keep
in mind however that apart from its intrinsic simplicity,
the model used in this work suﬀers from two important
shortcomings. Firstly, the use of a simple screening prop-
erty as described by (1) and (2) cannot be justiﬁed for
all molecules, and certainly not for arbitrary distances.
Even when such screening applies, the magnitude of the
screening parameter λ is not known and is expected to
depend on the amount of equilibrium charge transfer be-
tween the wire and the metal leads. Secondly, a complete
calculation of the potential proﬁle along a molecular junc-
tion should take into account the fact that some of this
drop may take place on the metal leads near the junction.
Such a behavior was found in the calculation of Ref. [5].

V. CONCLUSIONS

The potential distribution along molecular wires in bi-
ased molecular junctions is determined in principle by
the detailed electronic structure of the wire and by the
response of this structure to the molecule-lead contacts
and to the bias. The present study has identiﬁed the wire
thickness as one of two generic attributes that largely
determine the way the potential drops along the wire.
Increasing this parameter leads to a crossover from a
three-dimensional electrostatic problem to an eﬀectively
one-dimensional situation. The accompanying increase
in screening causes a transition from a linear potential
proﬁle to a situation where the potential drops mostly
at the interfaces between wire and electrode. The other,
less accessible molecular property is its ability to screen
a local charge. In the present model calculation we have
used a simple screening length parameter to model this
molecular property, but further studies are needed for a
better characterization of this property.

It is obvious from these results that the ratio of the
wire thickness to the screening length does constitute an
important generic attribute that determines the general
behavior of the potential bias distribution along a molec-
ular wire. The relatively good ﬁt obtained between the

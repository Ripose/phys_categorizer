Abstract

The electron transfer kinetics of mixed-valence systems is studied via solv-

ing the eigen-structure of the two-state non-adiabatic diﬀusion operator for a

wide range of electronic coupling constants and energy bias constants. The

calculated spectral structure consists of three branches in the eigen-diagram, a

real branch corresponding to exponential or multi-exponential decay and two

symmetric branches corresponding to population oscillations between donor

and acceptor states. The observed electronic coherence is shown as a result of

underdamped Rabi oscillations in an overdamped solvent environment. The

time-evolution of electron population is calculated by applying the propagator

constructed from the eigen-solution to the non-equilibrium initial preparation,

and it agrees perfectly with the result of a direct numerical propagation of the

density matrix. The resulting population dynamics conﬁrms that increasing

the energy bias destroys electronic coherence.

I. INTRODUCTION

Quantum coherence in the dynamics of condensed phase systems has become a subject of

recent experimental and theoretical studies. A central issue is the observability of electronic

coherence in electron transfer systems given the fast dephasing time in many-body quantum

systems. Experimentally, with the advance in ultrafast laser technology, oscillations in elec-

tronic dynamics have been observed in photo-synthetic reaction centers and other electron

transfer systems and are believed to arise from vibrational and/or electronic coherence.1–3

Accurate measurements on photo-induced electron transfer in mixed-valence compounds

have demonstrated oscillations in electronic populations on the femtosecond time-scale.1,4

Theoretically, detailed path-integral simulations suggest that such oscillations take place in

electron transfer systems with large electronic coupling constants and are sensitive to the

initial preparation of the bath modes associated with the transfer processes. Lucke et al.5

extended the non-interacting blip approximation to incorporate the non-equilibrium initial

preparation and carried out extensive path-integral quantum dynamics simulations for elec-

tron transfer reactions. According to their ﬁndings, large-amplitude oscillations are most

likely to be observed in symmetric mixed-valence systems that are nearly adiabatic and

with initial conﬁgurations that are centered in the Landau-Zener crossing region. Using the

transfer matrix technique,6 Evans, Nitzan, and Ratner7 calculated short-time evolution for

the photo-induced electron transfer reaction in (NH3)5FeII(CN)RuIII(CN)5. Their results

show fast oscillations in the electronic population on the short time-scale(20 fs) followed

by a slower population relaxation on the long time-scale(100 fs). They pointed out that

these fast oscillations arise as the wave-function oscillates coherently between the donor

and acceptor states. The calculated long-time decay rate is considerably smaller than the

prediction by the golden-rule formulae,8,9 conﬁrming the inadequacy of non-adiabatic rate

theory in studying mixed-valence systems.

2

In fact, a simple classical argument helps understand the nature of the observed os-

cillations. As a function of the ratio between λ (the bath reorganization energy) and V

(the electronic coupling constant), there is a thermodynamic transition from the localized

electronic state in a double-well potential to the delocalized electronic state in a single well

potential.10–14 (i) In the localized regime (λ ≫ V ), the large reorganization energy destroys

electronic coherence; hence, electron transfer is an incoherent rate process, which can be de-

scribed by the non-interacting blip approximation or golden-rule rate in the non-adiabatic

limit and by transition state theory in the adiabatic limit.15–17 (ii) In the delocalized regime

(λ ≤ V ), the electronic wave function extends to both the donor and acceptor states and
electronic coherence persists over several oscillations.10 For mixed-valence compounds, the

electronic coupling constant is estimated to be in the range of 103cm−1, which is in the same

order as the reorganization energy.1,7 Therefore, the observed oscillations and relaxation in

mixed-valence systems are the consequence of a highly non-equilibrium coherence transfer

process.

Due to the delocalization nature of electronic states, an adiabatic picture18 is more useful

than the diabatic representation for analyzing the short-time dynamics in strongly-coupled

systems. In this picture, electronic coherence arises from Rabi oscillations between two adi-

abatic surfaces and decays because of electronic dephasing. Further, initial preparation and

wave-packet dynamics can modulate Rabi oscillations and the overall electronic dynamics.

Thus, the adiabatic representation provides a simple picture for mixed-valence systems as

well as a simple analytical method to model fast electron dynamics initiated by laser pulses.

As a general approach to describe condensed phase dynamics, we recently proposed a

spectral analysis method,19 which is based on eigen-structures of dissipative systems instead

of dynamic trajectories. An important application of the approach is to analyze a set of

two-state diﬀusion equations, which was ﬁrst used by Zusman to treat solvent eﬀects on

3

electron transfer in the non-adiabatic limit. The analysis allows us to characterize multiple

time-scales in electron transfer processes including vibrational relaxation, electronic coher-

ence, activated curve crossing or barrier crossing. With this uniﬁed approach, the observed

rate behavior, bi-exponential and multi-exponential decay, and population oscillations are

diﬀerent components of the same kinetic spectrum. Thus, several existing theoretical mod-

els, developed for limited cases of electron transfer, can be analyzed, tested, and extended.

In particular, rate constants extracted from the analysis bridge smoothly between the adia-

batic and non-adiabatic limits, and the kinetic spectrum in the large coupling regime reveals

the nature of the localization-delocalization transition as the consequence of two competing

mechanisms.

In this paper, the spectral analysis approach developed in Ref. 19 is employed to study the

electron transfer dynamics in mixed-valence systems. We invoke the non-adiabatic diﬀusion

equation proposed by Zusman to describe the electron transfer process in the over-damped

solvent regime. As discussed earlier, electron transfer in mixed-valence systems takes place

in a diﬀerent kinetic regime from the thermal activated regime described by Marcus theory.

Thus, the time-scale separation is not satisﬁed, and multi-exponential decay and oscillations

are intrinsic nature of electron transfer kinetics. As a result, the kinetic spectra exhibit bifur-

cation, coalescence, and other complicated patterns. Careful examination of these patterns

reveals the underlying mechanisms in mixed-valence systems.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: The spectral structure of the non-adiabatic

diﬀusion equation is formulated in Sec. II. Numerical examples of the spectral structure

of strongly mixed electron transfer systems are presented and discussed in Sec. III and

concluding remarks are given in Sec. IV.

II. THEORY

There have been extensive studies of the solvent eﬀect on electron transfer dynamics

in literature with various approaches.20–24 One of the most extensively studied models for

quantum dissipation is the spin-boson Hamiltonian,14,23

where ǫ is the energy bias between the two electronic states, V is the electronic coupling

constant, σz and σx are the usual Pauli matrices, and {xα,pα} represents the bath degree of
freedom with mass mα, frequency ωα, and the coupling constant cα. In this model eﬀects

of the bath modes on the dynamics of the system can be described via the spectral density

deﬁned by,

J(ω) =

δ(ω − ωα).

(2)

Equivalently, the spin-boson Hamiltonian in Eq. (1) can be separated into the electronic

two-level part HT LS and the nuclear bath part HB,

HSB = HT LS + HB.

The two-level part of the Hamiltonian can be explicitly written as

HT LS(E) = U1(E)|1ih1| + U2(E)|2ih2| + V (|1ih2| + |2ih1|),

(3)

(4)

where the diabatic energy surfaces U1(E) and U2(E) are functions of the stochastic variable

E, which represents the polarization energy for a given solvent conﬁguration.20 The trans-

formation from the spin-boson Hamiltonian to the two-level system Hamiltonian has been

shown in the literature23,25 by the identity,

E({xα}) = Xα

cαxα.

5

(5)

It is worthwhile to mention that the polarization energy E was recognized as the reaction

coordinate by Marcus in formulating non-adiabatic electron transfer theory.15 Since the

electron transfer process involves the collective motion of a large number of solvent degrees

of freedom and the two-level system is linearly coupled to the harmonic bath modes in

the spin-boson Hamiltonian in Eq. (1), the functional form for the free energy surface is

harmonic,26 thus giving

U1(E) =

Considering the fact that electron transfer processes are usually probed at room temper-

ature in polar solvents, we can treat the bath degrees of freedom in HB classically. Then,

the spin-boson Hamiltonian in Eq. (3) can be used to derive a two-level classical equation

of motion,

ρ(t) = Lρ(t) = (LB + LT LS)ρ(t),

(9)

where iLB = {HB,} is the Poisson operator for the classical bath and LT LS = [HT LS, ]/¯h
is the Liouville operator for the two level system. Explicitly, we express Eq. (9) in terms of

the density matrix elements,

˙ρ1 = L1ρ1 + iV (ρ12 − ρ21),
˙ρ2 = L2ρ2 − iV (ρ12 − ρ21),
˙ρ12 = L12ρ12 − iω12ρ12 + iV (ρ1 − ρ2),
˙ρ21 = L21ρ21 + iω12ρ21 − iV (ρ1 − ρ2),

where the Planck constant ¯h is set to unity for simplicity, ρi is the diagonal matrix element

for electronic population, and ρij is the oﬀ-diagonal matrix element for electronic coherence.

Here, L describes the relaxation process of classical bath, with Li deﬁned on the free energy
surface for the ith electronic state, and with L12 and L21 deﬁned on the averaged free
energy surface. This set of semi-classical two-state equations has been previously derived in

diﬀerent context by several authors.20,23,27 It should be mentioned that the mapping from the

spin-boson Hamiltonian into the Zusman model requires the Lorentzian form of the spectral

density,

J(ω) = 2λ

(11)

Furthermore, we note that many chemically and biologically important electron transfer

processes take place in the over-damped solvent environment. Therefore, to describe the

density matrix evolution in the electron transfer kinetics in the mixed-valence system, we

invoke the non-adiabatic diﬀusion equation proposed by Zusman.20 Then, the bath relaxation

operators in Eq. (9) are one-dimensional Fokker-Planck operators Lij,

ω12(E) = U1(E) − U2(E).

The energy diﬀusion constant DE is deﬁned as

where ∆2

E is the mean square ﬂuctuation of the solvent polarization energy

∆2
E = hE2i = 2λkBT,

and τD = 1/Ω is the the characteristic timescale of the Debye solvent. The correlation

function of the solvent polarization energy is given by

C(t) = hE(t)E(0)i = ∆2

E exp(−Ωt).

(17)

Note that since the nuclear dynamics is modeled by the Fokker-Planck operator, the possi-

bility of the vibrational coherence is excluded in this model of electron transfer dynamics. It

is worthwhile to mention that one can obtain the non-adiabatic diﬀusion equation starting

from the spin-boson Hamiltonian, by ﬁrst deriving the evolution equation for the quantum

dissipative dynamics, and then taking the semi-classical limit using the Wigner distribution

functions, and ﬁnally assuming the over-damped diﬀusion limit.23

We investigate the spectral structure of the non-adiabatic diﬀusion operator by calcu-

lating the eigenvalues {−Zν} and the corresponding eigen-functions {|ψνi}. Hereafter we
use Greek indices to denote the eigenstates and Latin indices to denote the basis states of

the non-adiabatic diﬀusion operator. Because the non-adiabatic Liouville operator is non-

Hermitian, the eigenvalues are generally given by complex values, and the right and left

eigen-functions corresponding to the same eigenvalue are not simply the Hermitian conju-

gate to each other.28 For a given eigen-value Zν, the right and left eigen-functions of the

non-adiabatic diﬀusion operator are obtained from

The method of eigenfunction solution is well known for the diﬀusion process on the har-

monic potential energy surface.29 For a single quadratic potential U(x) = 1

(20)

(21)

with γ = Dmω2/kBT . Since the transformed potential in Eq. (21) is just the same form as

for a simple harmonic oscillator with zero point energy compensation, the eigenvalues and

the eigen-functions for the original Fokker-Planck operator can be constructed immediately

from the eigen-solutions of the harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian. Unlike the diﬀusion problem

on the single potential energy surface, there have been limited studies on the non-adiabatic

diﬀusion problem involving more than one potential energy surface. In this aspect, Cukier

and co-workers have calculated the electron transfer rate by calculating the lowest eigenvalue

of the non-adiabatic diﬀusion equation; however, their calculation was limited to the weak-

coupling regime where the Zusman rate is applicable.27

An important issue in solving the non-adiabatic diﬀusion equation for electron transfer

is the choice of the basis functions since three diﬀerent free energy surfaces are involved in

Eq. (9): two diabatic surfaces for the population density matrix elements and one averaged

surface for the coherence density matrix element. In this paper, the eigen-functions of L12
In principle,
are used as our basis set to represent the non-adiabatic diﬀusion equation.

one could have chosen the eigen-functions of L1 or L2 as basis functions, however, in that
case one has to evaluate appropriate Franck-Condon factors when calculating the coupling

matrix elements even with the Condon approximation. The Fokker-Planck operator L12 is
deﬁned on the averaged harmonic potential centered at E = 0, and its eigen-solutions are

To be consistent with the L12 basis set, we separate the real and imaginary parts of the

coherence density matrix, namely, u =Reρ12 and v =Imρ12, and rewrite Eq. (9) as

˙ρ1 = (L12 + δL)ρ1 − 2V v,
˙ρ2 = (L12 − δL)ρ2 + 2V v,
˙u = L12u + ω12v,
˙v = L12v − ω12u + V (ρ1 − ρ2),

where we have deﬁned δL as

δL = L11 − L22

(26a)

which is an explicit basis set representation for the two-state diﬀusion operator in Eq. (9).

The linear equations for the left eigen-solution as deﬁned by Eq. (19) can be written by the

transpose of Eqs. (33a)-(33d). Diagonalizing the 4N × 4N matrix (N = number of basis
functions) deﬁned in Eqs. (33a)-(33d), we obtain the eigenvalues −Zν and the corresponding

In general, due to the non-Hermitian nature of the non-adiabatic diﬀusion operator, the

right and left eigen-functions do not form an orthogonal set by themselves. However, when

the eigenvalues are all non-degenerate, the left and right eigen-functions form an orthogonal

and complete set in dual Hilbert space.30 Explicitly, we have

for the orthogonality and

for the completeness. Using these properties, we can construct the real time propagator for

(38)

and express the time evolution of the density matrix by projecting a given initial distribution

onto the eigenstates, giving

|ρ(t)i = G(t)|ρ(0)i = Xν |ψR

ν ihψL

ν |ρ(0)ie−Zν t.

(39)

Hence, the eigen-solution to the two-state non-adiabatic diﬀusion equation leads to a com-

plete description of electron transfer dynamics.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

In the section, we present the spectral structure of the non-adiabatic diﬀusion operator

by diagonalizing its matrix representation in Eqs. (33a)-(33d). In principle, we need inﬁnite

number of basis functions to diagonalize the non-adiabatic diﬀusion operator, however, in

practice, we have to truncate our basis set at some ﬁnite number. In all the calculations

below, we have used N = 50− 200 to diagonalize the 4N × 4N matrix and the eﬀect of ﬁnite
number basis on the spectral structure has been carefully examined.

12

A. Spectral Structure

1. Mixed-valence systems

In the mixed-valence compounds, the electronic coupling constant has the same order

of magnitude as the reorganization energy and the electron transfer dynamics is usually

probed experimentally at room temperature in polar solvents. To study this process, Evans,

Nitzan, and Ratner7 carried out real time path-integral simulations for the photo-induced

electron transfer reaction in (NH3)5FeII(CN)RuIII(CN)5. Based on their model, we chose the

parameters for the calculation shown in Fig. 1 as βΩ = 0.6716, βλ = 18.225, βV = 11.99,

and βǫ = 18.705. As mentioned in the introduction the mapping between the spin-boson

Hamiltonian and the semi-classical Zusman equation is not rigorously deﬁned. For example,

for the non-adiabatic diﬀusion equation, the solvation energy correlation function takes

an exponential form with the rate Ω, whereas, for the spin-boson model Hamiltonian, it

depends on the functional form of the spectral density. It can be shown that the Ohmic

spectral density with an exponential cut-oﬀ ωc

J(ω) = ηω exp(−ω/ωc),

(40)

used in the calculation of Evans et al., leads to an energy correlation function with a

Lorentzian form at high temperature,23

CSB(t) ≈

2ηωckBT

π

1

1 + (ωct)2 .

(41)

Then, the relaxation rate Ω used in our calculation is taken as the inverse of the mean

survival time of CSB(t), which is Ω = 2ωc/π.

In Fig. 1 the spectral structure of the non-adiabatic operator is shown in complex space.

We have used N = 200(4N = 800) basis functions to calculate the eigenvalues. To remove

the eﬀect of ﬁnite basis set from the resulting spectral structure, we only show the ﬁrst

13

400 eigenvalues in the complex plane. Since the non-adiabatic diﬀusion operator is non-

Hermitian, the resulting spectrum shows complex conjugate paired eigenvalues as well as

real eigenvalues, giving rise to the tree structure with three major branches (which we will

call the eigen-tree). In Fig .1, we separate the real and imaginary parts of eigenvalue by

− Zν = −kν − iων.

(42)

Obviously, the real part, kν, is always negative as all non-equilibrium physical quantities

decay to zero at time inﬁnity, and it scales linearly with the index ν since the relaxation rate

corresponding to the nth basis state φn is proportional to n. In general, the relative magni-

tudes of real and imaginary parts of eigenvalues determine the time-evolution of the density

matrix: the real eigenvalues correspond to the simple exponential decay components and

the complex conjugate paired eigenvalues correspond to the damped oscillation components.

To classify the eigenvalues quantitatively according to their dynamic behavior, we intro-

duce the dimensionless quantity θν

θν ≡

,

2πkν
|ων|

(43)

where kν is the decay rate and 2π/ων is the oscillation period. The time-evolution of the den-

sity matrix component associated with the eigenvalue Zν is an exponential decay if θν = ∞,
an under-damped oscillation if θν > 1, and a damped oscillation if θν ≤ 1. The relative
amplitude of the each component depends on the overlap matrix element between the ini-

tial density matrix and the eigenstate. As an approximate criterion for the classiﬁcation

of the eigenvalues, the slope corresponding to θν = 1 is shown in the eigen-tree diagram

in Fig. 1. There are a few eigenstates around and below the θν = 1 line, with a typical

rate of βkν ≈ 5. For the parameters used in the calculation, β corresponds to ∼170 fs in
real time, and, therefore, these eigenstates exhibits damped oscillations with a period and

a decay time in the femtosecond regime. In their real-time path integral simulations, Evans

14

et al. showed that the population in the acceptor state oscillates with a few femtosecond

period and these oscillation decays in within 20 femtoseconds. Thus, qualitative features

of the electron transfer dynamics can be predicted and understood from a careful exami-

nation of the spectral structure. Since the spectral analysis presented here is based on the

semi-classical diﬀusion equation while the path-integral study is based on the quantum me-

chanical spin-boson Hamiltonian, the comparison between the two approaches is expected

to be qualitative. In the following subsection, further analysis reveals the nature of these

oscillations.

2. Dependence on the coupling constant V

To examine the underlying spectral structure in more details, eigenvalues of the non-

adiabatic diﬀusion operator are plotted as functions of the electronic coupling constant in

Fig. 2. All the parameters except for the electronic coupling constant are the same as used

in Fig. 1.

In Fig. 2(a), the real parts of the ﬁrst 20 eigenvalues are shown as functions of the

electronic coupling constant. Note that eigenvalues corresponding to complex conjugate

pairs have the same real part, thus they coalesce in the real eigenvalue diagram. When

the coupling constant is very small (βV ≪ 1), the real part of the ﬁrst non-zero eigenvalue
is very well separated from the eigenvalues of excited states, so the dynamics of electron

transfer can be considered as a incoherent rate process with a well-deﬁned rate constant,

k1. When the coupling constant is larger (βV ≈ 1), the ﬁrst excited state becomes close
to the second excited state, and they start to merge into a complex conjugate pair. If the

coupling constant increases further, eigen-values show a bifurcation behavior at βV ≈ 10.
Therefore, in this regime, the electron transfer kinetics show multiple time-scale relaxation

as well as coherent oscillation. The complicated behavior of coalescence and bifurcation in

15

the real eigenvalue appears more frequently at higher states.

Another interesting feature of the real eigenvalue diagram is that a set of real eigenval-

ues decreases consistently as the coupling constant increases from zero. It turns out that

these eigenstates take on large imaginary parts, which are responsible for the onset of the

imaginary branches of the eigen-tree.

In Fig. 2(b), the imaginary parts of the lowest 30

eigenvalues are plotted as functions of the coupling constant. Interestingly, the imaginary

part of the eigenvalue increases approximately linearly with the coupling constant at large

coupling regime. In fact, the dependence on the coupling constant is similar to that of the

Rabi frequency for the two-level system,

ΩR = √ǫ2 + 4V 2,

(44)

which is shown in Fig. 2(b). As pointed out in a recent paper,18 electronic coherence in

mixed-valence systems arises from Rabi oscillations between two adiabatic surfaces and

decays because of dephasing.

To demonstrate the correlation of the real and imaginary parts of the eigenvalues as

functions of the coupling constant, we present a three dimensional plot of the spectral

structure in Fig. 2(c). For clarity, only the positive branches of the imaginary eigenvalues

are shown. If we compare Fig. 2(c) with Fig. 2(a), the very rapidly decaying states shown in

Fig. 2(a) take on large imaginary parts corresponding to the Rabi oscillations as the coupling

constant increases, and these states are responsible for the onset of the imaginary branches

in the eigen-tree for the mixed-valence system shown in Fig. 1.

B. Density Matrix Propagation

To check the validity of the spectral analysis as a density matrix propagation scheme,

we calculated the time-evolution of the density matrix by applying the propagator deﬁned

16

by Eq. (38) to the initial density matrix for various energy biases. Although it may seem

straightforward to use the spectral method as a propagation scheme, the case for a non-

Hermitian operator is not trivial and has not been explored. The main reason is that

though the left and right eigen-functions of a non-Hermitian operator can be shown to form

a bi-orthogonal set for the non-degenerate eigenvalue case, numerically these eigen-functions

may not be stable enough to be used as a complete orthonormal basis for the density matrix

propagation, especially in the nearly degenerate eigenvalue case. We can understand the

situation as follows: When the two nearly degenerate eigenvalues Z1 and Z2 are obtained

from a non-Hermitian operator, the orthogonality implies that hL2| and |R1i are orthogonal
to each other as well as hL1| and |R2i. When two eigenvalues become very close to each
other, unlike the Hermitian operator case, hL1| and hL2| almost coincide and so do |R1i
and |R2i, so that hL1| and |R1i become almost orthogonal to each other. To still satisfy
the normalization condition hLn|Rni = 1 in this case, the eigenfunction should be scaled
up, thus making the spectral structure very sensitive to the numerical error involved in the

calculation of eigenfunctions. For an interesting discussion on this point, one may refer

to the work by Nelson and co-workers.30 Due to this numerical instability, the use of the

spectral method as a density matrix propagation scheme is not without limitation.

Figure 3a shows the spectral structure and the time-evolution of the density matrix

propagation for the case of βΩ = 1, βλ = 15, βV = 12, and βǫ = 5. Generally, when

the energy bias is small (βǫ ≤ 5), the left and right eigenfunctions can form a complete
orthonormal basis set, so the spectral method is stable and can be used as a numerical

propagation method for the density matrix. With a large energy bias, however, the calculated

eigenfunctions may not form a complete orthonormal basis. To model for the photo-induced

back electron transfer experiment in the mixed-valence compounds the initial density matrix

is chosen as a thermal equilibrium distribution of the donor state(i.e. 1-state) pumped to

17

It would be straightforward to calculate the spatial distribution of the density matrix in time

ρ(E, t) by applying the propagator in Eq. (38) to the above initial density matrix; however,

to demonstrate the overall temporal behavior only the time evolution of the total population

in the acceptor state is calculated,

P2(t) = Z dEρ2(E, t).

(46)

In order to check the validity of the spectral method as a propagation scheme in this case,

we also calculated the time evolution of the density matrix by directly solving the 4N

diﬀerential equations for the expansion coeﬃcients of the density matrix using the Bulirsh-

Stoer algorithm,31 and the comparison in Fig. 3(a) shows a perfect agreement. If only the

transient behavior is concerned with, the direct propagation method would be preferred over

the spectral method, however, the spectral propagation has the advantage when calculating

the long time behavior once the complete spectrum is known. Overall, the computational

costs for two method are comparable to each other. As expected from the spectral structure

shown in the previous section the population in the acceptor state shows an underdamped

coherent oscillation behavior at initial times followed by a damped oscillation behavior at

later times.

Further, we have also studied the density matrix propagation for diﬀerent energy biases

to examine the electronic dephasing eﬀect. As seen from Fig. 4(a), the increase in energy

bias destroys the electronic coherence dramatically. Another interesting observation is the

phase shift in the population dynamics as the energy bias is varied, and it is because the

Rabi oscillation frequency increases with energy bias. We can conﬁrm the temporal behavior

18

of the density matrix propagation by examining the spectral structure shown in Fig. 4(b).

The period of the initial coherence is estimated to be τosc ≈ 0.25β from Fig. 4(a).
comparison, the Rabi frequency for the corresponding adiabatic two-level system is given by

In

ΩR = √ǫ2 + 4V 2 ≈ 25β −1, which can also be obtained from the onset of imaginary branches

in the eigen-tree shown in Fig. 4(b), and the estimation is consistent with the oscillation

period observed in the dynamics since τosc ≈ 2π/ΩR. The real eigenvalues of the lowest
excited states in the the imaginary branches are estimated to be βk ≈ 1− 2, and they agree
with the decay time of the oscillation amplitude in Fig. 4(a), conﬁrming the validity of the

spectral method as a density matrix propagation scheme. Even though it has been well

known in the literature that the damping of population is enhanced with increased energy

asymmetry,14 we have also conﬁrmed this through the spectral analysis method.

As an example of the eigenfunction responsible for the coherent oscillation behavior ob-

served in Fig. 4 (b), we show the left and right eigenfunctions corresponding to a complex

eigenvalue βZ = 2.6228 ± i26.394 for a symmetric case (βǫ = 0) and βZ = 2.8057 ± i26.466
for an asymmetric case(βǫ = 5) in Figs. 5 and 6. The eigenfunctions corresponding to

a complex conjugate pair of eigenvalues are also complex conjugate to each other; there-

fore, the frequency spectrum of the density matrix evolution is proportional to the norm of

wavefunction. We note that the left eigenfunction is more extended than the right eigenfunc-

tion. Although the population distribution in the donor and acceptor states corresponding

to coherent oscillation is inverted with respect to the Boltzmann distribution, it does not

contribute to the steady-state population distribution due to the transient nature.

IV. CONCLUDING REMARKS

In this paper we have applied the spectral analysis method to the non-adiabatic two-state

diﬀusion equation, that describes electron transfer dynamics in Debye solvents. In particular,

19

we have examined electronic coherence in mixed-valence compounds, and demonstrated

that underdamped Rabi oscillations are observed in an overdamped solvent environment.

Detailed study of the spectral structure of the non-adiabatic operator for various energy

biases and coupling constants allows us to determine the underlying mechanisms of electron

transfer kinetics. Eigenvalues form three branches in the eigen-diagram: a single branch of

real eigenvalues and two symmetric branches of complex conjugate eigenvalues. In strongly

coupled systems, all three branches have a similar order of magnitude, indicating that both

multiple-exponential decay and coherent oscillations can be observed experimentally.

We have investigated the dependence of the spectral structure on the coupling con-

stant.

In the very weak coupling regime, the lowest excited state is well separated from

higher states, which makes the electron transfer dynamics a well-deﬁned rate process. In

the strong coupling regime, however, the eigenvalue diagram shows coalescence/bifurcation

behavior in the complex plane. We have used the spectral method to calculate the time-

evolution of the density matrix, and indeed, observed electronic coherence in the temporal

behavior of population in the acceptor state for non-equilibrium initial distributions. We

also found a good agreement between results of the spectral propagation method and of

the numerical propagation method for small energy bias cases. Due to non-Hermitianity of

the non-adiabatic operator, the spectral propagation method was not numerically stable for

large energy bias cases.

For an isolated quantum system, the eigen-solution to the Schr¨odinger equation com-

pletely determines its dynamics. In a similar fashion, the eigen-solution to the non-adiabatic

diﬀusion operator completely characterizes the dynamics of a dissipative system and thus

provides a powerful tool to analyze dissipative dynamics. It is well known that quantum dy-

namics comes from the underlying spectra, especially in gas-phase chemical systems;32 how-

ever, the spectral aspect of condensed phase dissipative systems has not been well recognized

20

yet and deserves further investigation. Though the analysis presented here is restricted to

semi-classical dissipative systems, it may also be applied to quantum dissipative dynamics.

In principle, we can derive the evolution equation for quantum dissipative systems either

from ﬁrst principles or through numerical reduction, and then pose the quantum dissipative

equation of motion as an eigen-value problem. Along this line, the dissipative dynamics of

the spin-boson Hamiltonian, which has been studied mostly as a dynamic problem,6,33 can

also be explored as a spectral problem in the future.

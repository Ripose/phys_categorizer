The origin of the Langevin equation and the calculation of the mean squared
displacement: Let’s set the record straight

Ornstein and his coauthors, who constructed a dynamical theory of Brownian motion, taking the
equation mdv/dt = −ζv + X as their starting point, usually named the equation after Einstein alone
or after both Einstein and Langevin; furthermore, Ornstein, who was the ﬁrst to extract from this
equation the correct expression for ∆2, the mean-squared distance covered by a Brownian particle,
credited de Haas-Lorentz, rather than Langevin, for ﬁnding the stationary limit of ∆2. A glance at
Einstein’s 1907 paper, titled “Theoretical remarks on Brownian motion”, should suﬃce to convince
one that it is not unfair to attribute the conception of the above equation, now universally known as
the Langevin equation, to Einstein. Langevin’s avowed aim in his 1908 article was to recover, through
a route that was ‘inﬁnitely more simple’, Einstein’s 1905 expression for the diﬀusion coeﬃcient, but
a careful reading of Langevin’s paper shows that—depending on how one interprets his description
of the statistical behavior of the random force X appearing in the above equation—his analysis
is at best incomplete, and at worst a mere tautology. Since textbook accounts are based on the
interpretation that renders the proof fallacious, alternative derivations, which are adaptations of
those given by de Haas-Lorentz and Ornstein, are presented here. Some neglected aspects of the
contents of Ornstein’s early papers on Brownian motion are also brought to light.

1.

INTRODUCTION

It has become customary1 to mark the birth of stochas-
tic diﬀerential equations with the publication of the 1908
piece2,3 by Langevin—because he was the ﬁrst to inscribe
such an equation. It is equally common to regard Orn-
stein as the principal architect of the modern theory of
Brownian motion—because he showed, in a series of semi-
nal papers,4−9 how one may extract physically signiﬁcant
information from what is now called Langevin’s equation.
Yet it does not appear to be widely known that, in nearly
all his papers, Ornstein named the underlying stochastic
equation after Einstein alone or after both Einstein and
Langevin.

Though the question “Did Ornstein have any grounds
for associating the archetypal stochastic equation with
Einstein?” will be answered in this article, it will not oc-
cupy center-stage. My principal purpose is rather to draw
attention to an unsatisfactory feature of Langevin’s os-
tensibly simple derivation of an expression for the mean-
squared displacement. One of his propositions (that re-
lating to the vanishing of the average value of the product
of the particle position x and the random force X), on
which the entire argument hinges, is oﬀered without any
proof; the singular ease with which the ﬁnal result is ar-
rived at provokes unease, rather than approval, when one
notices that the average values of vX and xv, two closely
related products involving the velocity v, cannot vanish,
but they must do so according to the reasoning employed
by Langevin.

I argue here that Langevin’s logic is seriously ﬂawed,
and its continued presentation to beginners no better

∗K. Razi Naqvi: razi.naqvi@phys.ntnu.no

than the dispensation of a nostrum to an unsuspecting
patient. A demolition plan, such as that proposed here,
stands a better chance of adoption if it is accompanied by
a constructive suggestion; accordingly, I also present an
alternative derivation, inspired by the ediﬁce constructed
by Ornstein and co-authors; though not as short as the
original Langevin version, it is logically sound, and yields
much greater insight. I also draw attention to an alter-
native treatment, due originally to de Haas-Lorentz,10
who may be called a forerunner of Ornstein, and to some
unaccountably neglected aspects of Ornstein’s work.

2. LANGEVIN, HIS FORERUNNERS,
CONTEMPORARIES AND AFTERCOMERS

Einstein11

Using

diﬀerent

and
approaches,
Smoluchowski12 had arrived, shortly before Langevin
turned his attention to the issue, at discordant ex-
pressions for the diﬀusion coeﬃcient D of a spherical
particle. Langevin lodged two claims at the start of
his analysis: “I have been able to determine, ﬁrst of
all, that a correct application of the method of Mr.
Smoluchowski leads one to recover the formula of Mr.
Einstein precisely, and, furthermore, that it is easy to
give a demonstration that is inﬁnitely more simple by
means of a method that is entirely diﬀerent”. [Emphasis
in the original]

It will be well to pause at this point and recall what
Einstein wrote in his 1907 paper. I recapitulate, in the
next two paragraphs, his statements after some condensa-
tion and a modicum of paraphrasing, but without chang-
ing his notation.

2.1. Einstein’s 1907 paper

If we knew nothing of the molecular theory of heat,
Einstein wrote,13 we should expect the following to hap-
pen. Suppose that we impart to a particle suspended
in a liquid a certain velocity applied to it from without;
then the particle will come to a halt as a result of the
friction of the liquid. If we ignore the inertia of the latter
and assume that the resistance experienced by a particle
moving with velocity v is 6πkP v, where k is the viscosity
of the liquid and P the radius of the particle, we obtain
the equation

m

dv
dt

= −6πkP v.

(1)

From this it follows that the velocity will fall to a tenth
of its original value in a time θ = ln 10 m/(6πkP ); for a
spherical particle of radius 2.5 µm suspended in water, θ
comes out to be 330 ns.

If we take into consideration the molecular theory of
heat, Einstein reminded the reader, we have to modify
this conception. We must continue to assume, as before,
that the particle will nearly completely lose its initial ve-
locity in the very short time θ through friction. But, at
the same time, we must assume that the particle gets
new impulses during this time by some process that is
the inverse of viscosity, so that it retains a speed which
on an average is equal to that implied by the Maxwell-
Boltzmann distribution. But since we must imagine that
direction and magnitude of these impulses are (approxi-
mately) independent of the initial velocity of the particle,
we must conclude that the velocity of the particle will be
very greatly altered in the extraordinary short time θ,
and, indeed, in a totally random manner.

It is clear that Einstein conceived, already in 1907, a
modiﬁed version of Eq. (1), the modiﬁcation entailing the
addition, on the right-hand side, of a random force. We
shall see (in the next section) that his assumptions about
the randomness of the additional force were echoed by
Langevin when the latter put pen to paper. ‘Let us with
Einstein consider a colloidal particle,’ wrote Ornstein et
al.9 in 1927 (without citing a speciﬁc Einstein article);
they presented in their own phrase the above argument
from Einstein’s 1907 note, and wrote down the amended
equation immediately afterwards. Thus, it seems safe to
assume that Ornstein was familiar with the note, and
it was this knowledge that motivated him to credit Ein-
stein with the germinal idea for converting Eq. (1) into
a stochastic diﬀerential equation.

2.2. Langevin’s 1908 paper

Langevin accepted the validity of the equipartition

principle by writing

2

(3)

(5)

(6)

(7)

where a bar denotes ‘an average extended over a large
number of identical particles’, and the other symbols have
their usual meanings. Using µ and a instead of Einstein’s
k and P , respectively, he wrote the equation of motion
in the form

m

d2x
dt2 = −6πµa

dx
dt

+ X,

and added immediately afterwards: “About the comple-
mentary force X, we know that it is indiﬀerently posi-
tive and negative and that its magnitude is such that it
maintains the agitation of the particle, which the viscous
resistance would stop without it”. It is to be noted that
he says ‘we know’ while Einstein wrote ‘we must assume’.
Langevin multiplied Eq. (3) by x, and arrived, after
some elementary manipulations at the following equa-
tion:

m
2

d2x2
dt2

− mv2 = −3πµa

+ Xx.

(4)

dx2
dt

Next, he took an ensemble average, argued that ‘the av-
erage value of the term Xx is evidently null by reason of
the irregularity of the complementary forces X’, replaced
the average mv2 by its equipartition value, introduced
the symbol

and arrived ﬁnally at his key equation:

z =

dx2
dt

=

d x2
dt

,

m
2

dz
dt

+ 3πµaz =

RT
N

.

He was seeking after an expression for z, whose stationary
limit was to be equated to 2D; this limit, to be denoted
by z∞, emerges as soon as one sets dz∞/dt = 0. The
result agrees with Langevin, who took a slightly longer
route and found

D =

RT
6πµaN

,

thereby duplicating Einstein’s result.

2.3. An assessment of Langevin’s paper

It is worth remarking ﬁrst that Langevin’s use of sym-
bols and his further manipulations are reminiscent of the
steps choreographed by Clausius in a paper where he de-
rived the virial theorem.14 Clausius used the symbol X
for the deterministic force when he wrote Newton’s equa-
tion of motion for a particle (moving in a non-resistive
medium), m(d2x/dt2) = X, and made use of the follow-
ing identity:

mv2 =

RT
N

,

2x

d2x
dt2 + 2

dx
dt

2

=

d2x2
dt2 .

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

(8)

Neither the conception of Eq. (3) nor its transformation
into a diﬀerential equation for x2 can be called truly orig-
inal. Be that as it may, it was Langevin who actually
wrote down Eq. (3) and—regardless of whose brainchild
it was—he eventually became its eponym.

My main concern is with Langevin’s justiﬁcation for
setting xX = 0. Many later authors have simply taken
his word for the vanishing of this average. The reception
accorded to his analysis may be summed up by quoting
from a recent review:15 “Langevin’s derivation, however,
was spectacularly simple and direct compared to the oth-
ers (this is probably why it is Langevin’s derivation rather
than Einstein’s that is usually found in modern text-
books)”. Among those who have endorsed Langevin’s
logic, one may mention Feynman,16 Reif,17, Heer18 and
the authors19 of a recent treatise devoted to the Langevin
equation.

I quote Feynman (who uses the symbol F for X):

Now what about x times the force? If
the particle happens to have gone a certain
distance x, then, since the irregular force is
completely irregular and does not know where
the particle started from, the next impulse
can be in any direction relative to x. If x is
positive, there is no reason why the average
force should also be in that direction.
It is
just as likely to be one way as the other. The
bombardment forces are not driving it in a
deﬁnite direction. So the average value of x
times F is zero. [Italics in the original]

This line of reasoning would lead one to infer, as has
indeed been done, that vX and xv also vanish. Let us
deal with vX ﬁrst. J. D. van der Waals Jr.20 multiplied
Eq. (3) by v, took an ensemble average, and set vX = 0
to ﬁnd

m
2

d v2
dt

= −6πηav2.

(9)

Van der Waals knew that Eq. (9) was unacceptable, since
it implied that v2 must decay to zero, contravening the
equipartition principle. There are two ways to resolve the
diﬃculty: one may either scrap the supposition vX = 0,
or discard Eq. (3) itself. Unfortunately, van der Waals
made the latter choice, and spent some eﬀort in formu-
lating his own theory of Brownian movement, using a
diﬀerent stochastic equation. Though van der Waals did
not succeed in winning support for his point of view, he
contributed indirectly by engaging Ornstein in a ﬁerce
debate. In the course of rebutting van der Waals, Orn-
stein and Burger (O&B) had to concede that Eq. (3) is
an approximation, albeit an excellent one.7 The limita-
tions of Langevin’s equation, which are easily perceived
(see below), ought to be emphasized even when it is in-
troduced in an elementary course.

To notice the untenability of the assumption xv = 0,

3

made by Heer,18 one only has to note that since

d x2
dt

= 2 xv

(identically),

(10)

the vanishing of xv implies the vanishing of D itself.

2.4. The treachery of physical intuition

It seems devilishly diﬃcult to divine, on the basis of
physical intuition alone, the statistical independence of
two random variables in a dynamical problem.21 Let no
one forget that Maxwell assumed, in his ﬁrst attempt
to deduce the law of distribution of molecular velocities,
that the distribution of the velocity component along
a particular cartesian axis was independent of the val-
ues along the other two axes.22 According to Chapman
and Cowling,22 “it would be natural to suppose that
these components are not independent”. Seven years
later, Maxwell repudiated this assumption, and made
a second attempt,23 which too proved to be unsatisfac-
tory when scrutinized by Boltzmann. After attributing
the proof presented in their book to Lorentz (who im-
proved Boltzmann’s exposition) Chapman and Cowling
comment: “This proof also is open to some objection, be-
cause of the assumption . . . that there is no correlation
between the velocity and the position of a molecule”.

Let us return now to Langevin, who accepted that z
eventually attains a stationary value. After averaging
Eq. (4), he should have seen that only one conclusion
was justiﬁed: the value of xX is (or becomes, at long
times) a constant that cannot be smaller than −RT /N .
Had he allowed for the possibility xX 6= 0, he would have
found, instead of Eq. (6),

dz
dt
from which one can only deduce that

+ 3πµaz =

RT
N

m
2

+ xX,

(11)

D =

z∞
2

=

1
6πµa

RT
N

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

+ xX

.

(12)

Since Langevin’s aim was to validate Eq. (7), the assump-
tion xX = 0 reduces his demonstration to a tautology.

The foregoing arguments amount to little more than
an elaboration of a footnote in which O&B, who used
the symbol ∆ for the mean-squared displacement, stated:
“From the formula (1) [Eq. (3) here] we can deduce the
relation ∆2 = bt if we introduce suppositions, it is how-
ever impossible to ﬁnd the value of b, without penetrating
into the mechanism of the Brownian motion”.7

2.5. Statistical properties of the random
acceleration

I ﬁnd it hard to evade the conclusion that Langevin
was tempted into making an error that has dodged de-
tection on account of its seductive simplicity. Still, I

will now adopt the exegesis, oﬀered by O&B as well as
Manoliu and Kittel,24 that Langevin’s pithy phrase ‘in-
diﬀerently positive and negative’ is to be interpreted as
follows: it implies not only that X = 0 but also a supple-
mentary relation, concerning the autocorrelation of X,
from which one can deduce the vanishing of the cross-
correlation xX. But these authors also noted the ne-
cessity of proving the vanishing of xX from the second
relation.
It is imperative to do so because, as Mano-
liu and Kittel point out,24 physical intuition might lead
one to conclude that xX 6= 0; after all, an encyclopae-
dia entry,25 cited by them, does warn the reader: “The
mean random force vanishes, but the mean product of
the random force into the displacement [in three dimen-
sions] is equal to −3kT ; the frequent assertion that this
product vanishes is mistaken”. Since proving the relation
xX 6= 0 entails, even if one takes the short cut devised
here, a good deal of preparatory work, the route taken by
Langevin, which has been praised for its brevity and sim-
plicity, turns into a wearisome trek (from the student’s
point of view), making Einstein’s treatment look like a
jaunt—unless the teacher is prepared to replace the as-
sertion ‘it is self-evident that xX = 0’ by the assurance
‘it can be shown that xX = 0’.

Enough has now been said to convince the reader that
Langevin’s derivation of the mean squared displacement
must be rectiﬁed, or replaced by a cogent alternative. All
the ingredients for accomplishing the latter task were as-
sembled by de Haas-Lorentz, but she stopped short, as
did Langevin before her, of going beyond the stationary
limit. It was Ornstein who, actually worked out, using
his own approach, the complete expression in 1917. The
prospects of adding something novel to this topic are in-
ﬁnitesimal indeed, but a repackaging of the material scat-
tered in Ornstein’s many publications seems worthwhile.
I wish to present a slightly diﬀerent and shorter account
than appears in the 1930 article26 of Uhlenbeck and Orn-
stein (U&O). As a preliminary, however, I wish to recall
some statements made by Ornstein in his ﬁrst paper.

3. ORNSTEIN’S 1917 PAPER

Ornstein began his ﬁrst paper on Brownian motion by
citing the works of Smoluchowski and Burger; referring
to the thesis of de Haas-Lorentz, later published as a
monograph,10 he remarked:

It is worth observing that the way diﬀer-
ent averages depend on time may be calcu-
lated from the results obtained by Mrs. de
Haas-Lorentz by a slightly more careful tran-
sition of the limit than was necessary for the
object she had put herself (viz. the determi-
nation of the stationary condition). First, I
want to determine these averages by a new
method . . .

ζ
m

dv
dt

t

0
Z

The relation used by de Haas-Lorentz and mentioned
by Ornstein has the following form (though they use dif-
ferent symbols):

m

dv
dt

= −ζv + X,

(13)

which has some advantages over the form chosen by
Langevin: The use, on the right-hand side, of the sym-
bol ζ rather than 6πηa saves some writing, besides ex-
tending the applicability of the equation to non-spherical
particles; the introduction of the particle velocity v also
simpliﬁes the resulting formulas, but the main reason for
the change is to emphasize that velocity, rather than the
position, is the quantity of greater interest here. Upon
dividing Eq. (13) by m, and setting

α ≡

and A ≡

X
m

.

one gets the still neater form

= −αv + A.

4

(14)

(15)

Ornstein carried out a formal integration of Eq. (15)

to get

v = v0e−αt + e−αt

eαt1 A(t1)dt1,

v0 ≡ v(0).

(16)

The fact that A(t1) on the right-hand side is a random
function did not worry him unduly, since he knew that
he would attribute physical signiﬁcance only to averaged
quantities. It is important to recall at this stage that,
in the works published during 1917–1930, Ornstein cal-
culated an average over those molecules which start, at
time t = 0, with a deﬁnite velocity (say v0); I will refer
to an average of this type as a v0-average, and distin-
guish it from an overall average (the quantity considered
by Langevin) by appending the symbol v0 to the bar sig-
nifying a particular average. A v0-average can itself be
averaged over all initial velocities (distributed according
to the Maxwell-Boltzmann law). If one’s aim is to obtain
only the overall average, it often proves more convenient
to bypass the v0-averaging. For the sake of complete-
ness, let us take note of a mean value that will be needed
shortly. If we take a v0-average of Eq. (15), we arrive,
after setting A
= 0, at the equation

v0

whose solution is

d v v0
dt

= −α v v0 ,

v v0 = v0e−αt.

(17)

(18)

This is, of course, the same result as would be obtained
by taking a v0-average of Eq. (16).

At this point, I would like to part company—at least
temporarily—with Ornstein and turn to the problem of
calculating the quantity xA.

5

4. EMENDING THE LANGEVIN ANALYSIS

Since we are dealing with a system that is in thermal

equilibrium, we can immediately state

v = 0,

v2 =

= β, say.

(19)

RT
N m

Our task is to deduce the statistical properties of A, using
only Eqs. (15) and (19). If we take an ensemble average
of Eq. (16), we get, after setting v0 = 0 on the right-hand
side,

The second equality follows from the fact that each term
within the square brackets equals αβ. After this demon-
stration, we can justiﬁably retrace the steps that took
Langevin from Eq. (4) to Eq. (6), and integrate our ver-
sion of Eq. (6) to get

= −α xv + β,

(28)

which can itself integrated to obtain

xv =

1 − e−αt

.

Since d x2 /dt = 2 xv , we ﬁnally get, with x0 ≡ x(0),

(cid:1)

from which follows the relation A = 0.

Averaging the equation found by multiplying Eq. (15)

by 2v gives

d v2

= −2αv2 + 2vA = 0,

(21)

which shows, after it is combined with Eq. (19), that

vA = αβ.

a relation that Langevin could have derived but chose
not to do so. He was reluctant, as was de Haas-Lorentz
a few years later, to go beyond the expression derived by
Einstein. Needless to say, this result was ﬁrst obtained
by Ornstein5 by averaging his v0-average x2
over a
Maxwellian distribution of initial velocities.

On the other hand, multiplication of Eq. (16) by A(t)
and averaging gives

On equating the right-hand sides of the last two equations
one ﬁnds

eαt1A(t)A(t1)dt1,

(24)

a relation that can only hold if A(t)A(t1) possesses the

We have now completed the preliminaries for ﬁnding Ax.
Integration of Eq. (15) from 0 to t provides a relation
connecting x, v, and A:

v(t) − v0 = −α

x(t) − x(0)

+

A(t1)dt1

(26)

We now multiply Eq. (26) by A(t) and take an average
to ﬁnd, after some obvious rearrangement,

t

0
Z

(cid:3)

Ax =

A(t)A(t1)dt1 − vA

= 0.

(27)

(cid:21)

We see from Eq. (29) that the correlation of x and v,
assumed to be zero initially, rises exponentially (with a
time constant 1/α) to its stationary value. On the other
hand, the average vA turned out to be a constant; this is
simply because we have assumed the corresponding time
constant to be zero.
It is tempting to tinker with the
autocorrelation of A and assign it a small but non-zero
decay time by setting

A(t1)A(t2) = Cλe−λ|t2−t1|, C = constant.

(31)

Should we change our mind, we can always recover the
results previously obtained by letting λ → ∞ and assign-
ing C an appropriate value. Substituting the right-hand
side of the last equation into Eq. (23) and integrating we
get

vA =

Cλ
λ + α

1 − e−(λ+αt)

.

(32)

i

h
Though this result looks appealing, it should be rejected,
when dealing with a system that is in thermal equilib-
rium, because a time-dependent value of vA violates the
equipartition principle: according to Eq. (21), vA must
be a constant, and this constancy is incompatible with
any choice that makes the autocorrelation A(t1)A(t2)
decay at a ﬁnite rate. Ornstein and van Wijk (O&vW),
who dealt with overall averages rather than v0-averages,
emphasized that the statistical properties of A are deter-
mined as soon as one writes down Eqs. (15) and assumes
that the system is in thermal equilibrium.5 Manoliu and

Kittel overlooked this restriction when they replaced the
white spectrum of A by a Lorentzian;24 it will be pointed
out presently that the spectrum of A can be made col-
ored (nonwhite) only by modifying the equation of mo-
tion itself. The introduction of Eq. (31) did not lead
to an immediate generalization of our treatment, but it
can still serve as a crutch for those students who are
unable to jump from Eq. (24) to Eq. (25), or feel uncom-
fortable with an alternative (given below) involving the
Dirac delta function; in the next section, it will serve as
a part of a scheme devised for generalizing Eq. (15).

4.2. A critique of the Langevin equation itself

Let us set m = 1 so that we may speak of the force
rather than acceleration, and let w(t) = −αv + A de-
note the total force acting on the particle. O&B agreed
with van der Waals that for t = 0, w(t)
= 0. Besides
it is evident, they remarked, that for t inﬁnite the av-
erage value of w(t) undergoes no inﬂuence from v0 and
therefore must be zero. They noted that the course of
= 0 must be such that it starts from zero, attains
w(t)
a maximum (or minimum) and then falls to zero again.
On the other hand, Eqs. (15) and (18) show that

Fig. 1. Plots showing the time dependence of the average
force acting on a Brownian particle that started with a ve-

predicted by Eq. (15), whereas the dotted curve is obtained
by plotting the right-hand side of Eq. (34) with λ = 10α and
C = 12.

Assuming that v0 > 0, they drew two curves, one of
which, labelled by them as ‘Einstein’, is a plot of the
right-hand side of Eq. (33), and the other (which they
call the true curve) is a schematic plot of the behaviour
described above. I have taken the liberty of converting
their qualitative, freehand ﬁgure to a quantitative plot,

The reasons for choosing the above form will be explained
shortly; at present, it is enough to note that the resulting
curve resembles that drawn by O&B, and to proceed by
quoting their comments on the shapes of the curves:

For t = 0 the line, which represents this
course deviates from the true curve. The
important agreement existing between Ein-
stein’s theory and the experiment now makes
us presume, that the true w(t)-t curve and
the curve according to Einstein only deviate
from each other for short times after the de-
parture of the particle with the velocity v0
so that the maximum in the true curve lies
close to t = 0, and that from this maximum
onward it descends pretty well exponentially
according to Einstein’s curve. It goes with-
out saying that these are only assumptions,
which a calculation of the true w(t)
curve
must prove from the molecular theory. We
are however of the opinion that it is worth-
while to point to this possible interpretation
of Einstein’s master-stroke in the theory of
the Brownian motion.

It is remarkable that O&B recognized the limitations
of Eq. (15) as far back as 1918, and even pointed out the
nature of the reﬁnment that was needed. A generaliza-
tion of Langevin’s equation in the form

came almost ﬁfty years later.27 It can be shown that
α(t−t′) is proportional to the autocorrelation of A, which
explains the choice made in Eq. (34):
if we take a v0-
average of Eq. (35), and use a zero-order approximation
v v0 = v0 exp(−αt) on the right-hand side, and apply
Eq. (31), the integral would equal (apart from a multi-
plicative constant) the right-hand side of Eq. (34).

5. A RANDOM WALK IN VELOCITY SPACE

Both Langevin and Ornstein began with two claims:
each stated that though the desired result(s) could be
found by a re-working of an existing analysis, each would
rather present a derivation of his own. Ornstein men-
tioned that the time dependent averages can be calcu-
lated from the results obtained by de Haas-Lorentz,10
who credited the gist of the method used by her to
a 1910 article (not concerned with Brownian motion)
by Einstein and Hopf.28 She integrated Eq. (15) from

t = (N − 1)τ to t = (N − 1)τ , thereby converting it into
a diﬀerence equation:

on. Since we are going to let τ → 0, it is permissible to
write

vN − vN −1 = −αvN −1τ + IN −1,

(36a)

ρ = e−ατ ,

or ρN = e−αt.

where

We have now established that, as τ → 0, one gets

The time interval τ is so short that v does not change
substantially during this interval, but the ﬂuctuations
in A are supposed to be extremely rapid even on this
short time scale. With this background, we can already
state two statistical properties of the random term on the
right-hand side of Eq. (36a):

v0

δij =

0, otherwise.

We have arrived at Eq. (36a) by discretizing Eq. (15),
but an alternative point of view, adopted by Gunther and
Weaver,29 is worth a mention: One can regard Eq. (36a)
as the basic equation in its own right, I0, I1, · · · being
a sequence of mutually independent random variables;
a great virtue of Eq. (36a) is its amenability to Monte
Carlo simulation.29,30 Regardless of one’s interpretation,
Eq. (36a) can be immediately understood as describing a
random walk in velocity space, and its solution requires
only summation of geometric series, as demonstrated ﬁrst
by de Haas-Lorentz; her contribution has been underes-
timated, partly because she herself called it the method
of Einstein and Hopf, but mainly because she did not
extract the full time-dependence from her expressions.

It follows from iteration of Eq. (36a) that vN can be ar-
ranged as a sum. Since this section is supposed to provide
a discrete variant of Ornstein’s approach, we will express
the sum so as to highlight the correspondence between
Eq. (16) and its discrete counterpart shown below:

v v0 = v0e−αt,

a result that coincides with that stated in Eq. (18).

Upon squaring-and-averaging, Eq. (39), and making

use of Eqs. (37) and (38), we are left with

There is no need to go further since Gunther and
v0
Weaver29 have shown how to obtain v2
,
but two comments are still in order. First, they were
apparently unaware that the bulk of the calculation had
already been done by de Haas-Lorentz; secondly, they ar-
rive at a formula which may be written (when allowance
is made for the diﬀerence in notation and a typographical
error in their paper) as follows:

as well as x2

(40)

Let us now take a v0-average of Eq. (39), and arrive, after
using Eq. (37), at the relation

vN

v0 = v0ρN

(41)

We would expect, on letting N → ∞ and τ → 0, to re-
cover the results found by Ornstein if we make the iden-
tiﬁcations N τ = t, so that vN = v(t), xN = x(t), and so

At this stage, they only point out that if one sets v2
0 = β,
the expression for the mean-squared displacement given
in Eq. (47) reduces to that ‘obtained using the classical
Langevin equation’, namely that given in Eq. (30). Of
course, both expressions pertain to the Langevin equa-
tion, and their diﬀerence can be traced to diﬀerent aver-
aging procedures.

Continuing in the same vein, one can recover all the
mean values calculated by U&O; a veriﬁcation of this
statement will not be oﬀered in these pages.

6. THE DELTA FUNCTION

by the properties

v0

Ornstein’s handling of integrals involving the autocor-
reveals an uncanny prescience of
relation A(t2)A(t1)
an impulse function (some ten years before Dirac31 in-
troduced the delta function). Readers who do not have
easy access to Ornstein’s 1917 article may examine the
two 1927 articles, where the original calculations are re-
peated. In all these papers, Ornstein encounters the au-
tocorrelation when he calculates v2
; by squaring both
sides of Eq. (16) and performing a v0-average he ﬁnds

must be diﬀer-
At this point he argues that A(t1)A(t2)
ent from zero, since v2
for t = ∞ is positive, but it is
clear that the correlation can be appreciable only when
the diﬀerence between t1 and t2 is small. He introduces
τ = t2 − t1 as a new variable and proceeds as follows:

adding that the replacement of t1 + t2 in the exponent by
2t1 is justiﬁed because only the region around τ = 0 con-
tributes to the second integral. Finally, he states that it
is easily seen that the second integral is independent of t1
and t2, and is a characteristic constant for the problem at
hand, and may be denoted by a1. To a modern reader, it
should be evident that Ornstein identiﬁed the autocorre-
with a1δ(t1 − t2). In the 1917 article,
lation A(t1)A(t2)
he also evaluated v(t)A(t)
through the same reasoning
and found that its value to be a1/2. It will be instructive
to repeat this calculation using delta calculus. We have

Ornstein never used the name delta function but he did
use, in two joint publications with Uhlenbeck, the symbol

Z

δ(x)dx = 1”.

Seven years later, Ornstein and Uhlenbeck32 used the
symbol δ(E − ε) for expressing the condition “that at t =
0 all particles have the energy E,” and added “δ(E − ε) is
the well-known singular peak function”. However neither
U&O nor O&vW chose to take advantage of the delta
calculus, and preferred to carry out their manipulations
using the pre-Dirac manoeuvres pioneered by Ornstein;
in these two papers, the authors change both variables
by setting u = (t1 + t2) and w = (t1 − t2).
I will not
speculate about their preference, but will now raise, and
later answer, a diﬀerent question: Why has Ornstein not
been credited with the invention of the delta calculus?

The answer is not far to seek. The second section of
the 1927 paper of Dirac is devoted to notation, where he
states:

One cannot go far in the development of
the theory of . . . without needing a notation
for that function of . . . x that is equal to zero
except when x is small, and whose integral
through a range that contains the point x = 0
is equal to unity. We shall use the symbol
δ(x) to denote this function, i.e., δ(x) is de-
ﬁned by

δ(x) = 0 when x 6= 0,

and

∞

−∞

Z

dx δ(x) = 1.

Strictly, of course, δ(x) is not a proper func-
tion of x, but can be regarded only as a limit
of a certain sequence of functions. All the
same one can use δ(x) as though it were a
proper function for practically all the pur-
poses of . . . without getting incorrect results.
One can also use the diﬀerential coeﬃcients of
δ(x), namely δ′(x), δ′′(x) . . ., which are even
more discontinuous and less “proper” than
δ(x) itself.

A few elementary properties of these func-
tions will now be given so as not to interrupt
the argument later. We can obviously take
δ(x) = δ(−x), δ′(x) = −δ′(−x), etc.
. . .. If
f (x) is any regular function . . ., we have

∞

−∞

Z

f (x) δ(a − x)dx = f (a),

so that the operation of multiplying by δ(a −
x) and integrating with respect to x is equiv-
alent to the operation of substituting a for
x.

What we now call Dirac’s delta function might well
have been named after Ornstein, if the latter had inter-
rupted his argument to introduce, with appropriate fan-
fare, a new function, spelling out its principal properties
once and for all, and giving it a smart name.

7. THE NAMING OF THE PROCESS AND THE
PROCESS OF NAMING

With the exception of two papers, where Ornstein was
the only author, and a third, where he had more than one
coauthor, each of his other papers in the period 1917–33
was a joint eﬀort with a single coauthor: Burger, Uhlen-
beck, van Wijk and Zernike. Though Uhlenbeck is the
ﬁrst author of the 1930 article, the random process in-
vestigated in the article is now called Ornstein-Uhlenbeck
process. The person responsible for this reversal of or-
der is, as far as I can see, Doob,33 who must have been
under the impression that Ornstein was the ﬁrst author
(as can be veriﬁed by examining his list of references);
since he refers, throughout his paper, to ‘Ornstein and
Uhlenbeck’ it stands to reason that he introduced the
name ‘O.U. process’; subsequent authors have chosen to
replace the initials by complete names without reversing
their order. Since singling out Uhlenbeck among all the
coauthors named above seems (to me) unfair, and includ-
ing them all is clearly impractical, the choice ‘Ornstein
process’ would have been more equitable, but the name
‘Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process is here to stay.

Ornstein died in 1941.34 Four years later, Ming Chen
Wang and Uhlenbeck published their celebrated review
article.35 By now, they were unequivocal
in calling
Eq. (15) the Langevin equation; they also used the ap-
pellation ‘the Dirac delta function’ and used it for spec-
ifying the temporal behavior of the autocorrelation of A
by stating the relation

A(t1)A(t2) = 2αβδ(t1 − t2).

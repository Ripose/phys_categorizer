Abstract

An extension is given for the standard two component model of
adiabatic, Born-Oppenheimer (BO) electronic states in a polyatonic
molecule, by use of Mathieu functions of arbitrary order. The curl or
compatibility conditions for the construction of a diabatic set of states
based on a ﬁnite- dimensional subset of BO states are not satisﬁed
exactly. It is shown, however, that, by successively adding higher or-
der Mathieu functions to the BO set, the compatibility conditions are
satisﬁed with increasingly better accuracy. We then generalize to sit-
uations in which the nonadiabatic couplings (the dynamic corrections
to the BO approximation) are small (though not necessarily zero) be-
tween a ﬁnite-dimensional BO subset and the rest of the BO states.
We prove that approximate diabatic sets exist, with an error that is of
the order of the square of the neglected nonadiabatic couplings.

Background and Introduction, preceded by a

Homage

Some of the authors in the article have had the good fortune that their
pathways crossed with those of Per-Olov Lowdin, be this in Slater’s Group
at MIT, in Menton or at the Sanibel Workshops. They keep the memory of
an endowed and innovative researcher, as well as of a Scientist Statesman,
who followed in the footsteps of another great Scandinavian, Niels Bohr.

The question of whether it is possible to eﬀect in general an adiabatic
to diabatic transformation (ADT) has been recently reopened [1],[2],[3].
One formulation of the issues [4]-[9] is whether a strictly diabatic basis in
which linear combinations of a small number of Born-Oppenheimer elec-
tronic states are chosen in such a way that the nonadiabatic coupling be-
tween the transformed states vanishes exists.

In view of possible ambiguities let us deﬁne the terms:

ζk

. For any given value of
}

is a solution of the Born-Oppenheimer wave-equation for the electronic part
(electronic coordinates xe, to be suppressed at a later stage), involving (as
parameters) the nuclear coordinate set
,
}
the ζk form a complete set, known as the adiabatic set or Born-Oppenheimer
. Let us consider only the ﬁnite set
electronic states, labeled by k = 1..
∞
with k = 1, , n (where n is in practice 2
4). We shall call this the P -set and
designate its complement the Q set. (This nomenclature follows previous
practice to decompose the full Hilbert space into two disjoint subspaces, P
and Q [10]. Then the projection operator I over the full Hilbert space can
be written as the sum of two projection operators in the sub- spaces, namely
I = P + Q ) The challenge has been to ﬁnd a so-called diabatic set

Xr
{

−

ξm = ξm(xe, Xr)

related to the P adiabatic-set alone, such that the nuclear derivative term
in the nuclear part of the Born-Oppenheimer equation corresponding to ξm
vanishes. Baer [11] showed that this can be achieved with an ADT matrix
Aij(Xr) that satisﬁes

Aij,r + τ (r)

ik Akj = 0

for i, j, k in P and all nuclear coordinate indexes r. (A tensor-algebra nota-
tion is used here, but supplementing the double-index summation convention

with speciﬁcation of the range of summands. The symbol r after a comma
represents, as usual in tensor algebra, diﬀerentiation with respect to Xr).
Then

ξm = ζkAkm

(k, m in P ) and the nuclear Schr¨odinger equation contains no ﬁrst-order
derivatives of the nuclear co-factors of ξk . In equation (3)

This is a convenient set of initial conditions, which can, however, be general-
ized to cases when initially Akm is non-zero for any k and m both inside P ,
or both inside Q [2]. Reference [11] also noted the following compatibility
(curl) conditions as a requirement for the solution of equation (3) :

relations arise from diﬀerentiation of equation (3) with respect to Xs, a
further diﬀerentiation with respect to Xr of another equation of the form
equation (3) but involving s instead of r, and subtraction. The actual
requirement of compatibility is that

(k, m, n, h in P ). Satisfaction of the relations in equation (8) is a suﬃcient
condition for equation (9) to hold for all and any Amh and for the existence
of solutions in equation (3) .

Having now formulated the general issue,we work out in the next section
a case, involving Mathieu functions, in which equation (8) is not satisﬁed.
These functions have already been used in the context of the ADT matrix
[12]. We show here how the compatibility condition can be better and better
satisﬁed by successively enlarging in a systematic way the ﬁnite subset (the

3

P subspace). Having illustrated with the Mathieu functions the case of
small non-adiabatic coupling between P and Q subspaces, we then return
in section 3 to the general theory and show what modiﬁcations are needed
in the ADT matrix, generally, when the non-adiabatic coupling between P
and Q are small, of order ǫ. In section 5 we employ an analogy to show that,
as in the case of the ADT matrix, frequently a large Hilbert-space is needed
formally , but in practice a restricted space suﬃces.

2 Mathieu Functions as Adiabatic States

An electronic Schr¨odinger equation for the angular electronic coordinate θ
and the polar nuclear coordinates q and φ was written in Ref. [12], Eq. (1),

where Eel is a characteristic electronic quantity, G(q) is a nuclear-electronic
interaction coeﬃcient, frequently assumed to be proportional to the nuclear
coordinate q and u(q, φ) is the eigen-energy of the solution (being part of
the adiabatic potential for the nuclear motion). Equation (10) is recognized
as the Mathieu diﬀerential equation, which has enjoyed a wide literature
and a variety of notations [14]-[16]. We shall use the solutions given by
[12], in which
these sources (thus diﬀering from the methodology in Ref.
the solutions were derived), but shall retain the symbols for the parameters
introduced in Ref.
[12]. However, we shall make life easier for the reader
by giving the relations between the parameters. In the relations, we indi-
cate the literature sources by adding as subscripts the initials of the authors
surnames. In the spirit of Born-Oppenheimer approximation the small pa-
rameter in the theory is

Ref. [15], the two families of solutions of equation (10) that are of interest
to us have the form:

The functions are conventionally normalized to π, so that the squares of
the coeﬃcients sum up to 1. Thus, when we use equations (13 - 14) for
the wave-functions Ψ of equation (10) (that are normalized in the square
to unity) each function has to be divided by √π. When we number the
adiabatic electronic wave functions according to the order of their energy
surfaces (as is commonly done in molecular physics) by (m′), we have the
correspondences (for x > 0):

Now the eigenvalues u of equation (10)
[12, 15, 16] (this can be seen from the leading terms of equation (13) and
equation (14) in which equation (18) and equation (19) were taken into
consideration), therefore the n = 0 pair is well separated energetically from
the n > 0 states that lie higher. Adopting the nomenclature of section 1,
we shall call the two states in equation (13) and equation (14) with n = 0
it is nearly
the P subset. For x = 0, P is doubly degenerate; for small
degenerate. We look at the nonadiabatic coupling matrices τ within this
subset. Using the deﬁnitions shown in equation (5)
for r = q and φ (see
also equation (15) in Ref.
[12]) and the expansion in equation (16) and
equation (17) we obtain:

comes from the P -Q inter-set nonadiabatic coupling terms τ (r)
Jα . When we
evaluate
τ to the lowest order in x, we ﬁnd that this exactly matches
the curl-value and that the missing value come from the n = 1 functions ce3
and se3. This means that enlarging the P set from n = 0 to n = 0, 1 ensures
the compatibility conditions for the solution of the ADT matrix, correct to
the order of E−2

x) will require bringing in higher n values. It will be presently shown that
each higher power of x2 requires one further n.

We now turn to the nonadiabatic couplings τ (r)(J, α) =

where J is one of the n = 0 and α is one of n > 0. Since we calculate these
correct only to x, we ﬁnd from table 1, upon recalling the power series expan-
sions equation (16) and equation (17) for ce1 and se1 and the orthogonality

We now draw up the list of the nonadiabatic couplings labeled, express them
in terms of quantum mechanical bra-kets of the derivatives and give their

This agrees with the negative of the curl, as required. The contributing
intermediate states are seen to be the lowest energy set from Q (n = 1),
which is energetically immediately above the P (n = 0) set. This balances
the x2 term in the curl, equation (22) . More generally, as one goes in ce1,
se1 (or in Φ(1′),Φ(2′)) to higher approximations in x, curlτ1′2′ will contain
1
higher powers of x2. (Recall that x
Eel is the small parameter in the Born-
Oppenheimer approximation.) We wish to show now that each consecutive
term of order x2s in the expansion of curlτ1′2′ will be balanced by a further
set of the higher energy wave functions, precisely up to ce2s+1, se2s+1 and
none higher. (Since the method of computing the matrices is laborious, we

contradicting the assumption that n < r. Thus, in all cases, only Mathieu
functions of up to order n = s need to be added to the intermediate set to
compensate the x2s term in the curl; higher order functions start with higher
powers of x. This leads to a hierarchical extension of the P set to ensure
the compatibility condition to successively better accuracy in the ground,
(1′, 2′) set.

3 The Projected ADT Matrix

We return now to the general case embodied in equation (8) and equation
(9) .

It has been established (Ref.

[11], Appendix 1) that if in equation (8)
the summation over n is extended to P + Q, i.e. the intermediate states
run over the complete set, then equation (8) is satisﬁed for τ (r)
km deﬁned by
(5)-(6).

We shall now consider cases in which all τ (r)

km are small, (say) of order ǫ,
for either k or m being in the set Q complementary to P , though they can
be large for both k and m being in P or in Q. Physical conditions for the
existence of such situations have been noted before as either large energy
gaps between P and Q ([5], section III.A, end), or a strong vibronic coupling
localized in the neighborhood of some reference conﬁguration ([5], section
In section 4 we consider
III.B), with which the Q-set has small overlap.
yet another situation, where the smallness of ǫ arises from the small ratio
between electronic and nuclear masses.

Our aim is to show that equation (3) and equation (4) continue to be
approximately valid, even though equation (8) is not formally satisﬁed. Our
demonstration should disarm objections to some practical uses of the ADT
matrix. It also extends a previous proof [13], that the diabatic set exists
when the above considered τ (r)
km are exactly zero, to those more frequently
encountered situations, where the non adiabatic couplings are non-zero, but
small.

Notation: Henceforth we shall use Latin subscripts (e.g.,j, k, m, ..) for
the total Hilbert space, capital Latin subscripts (e.g., J, K, M, .. ) for the P
subset, and Greek subscripts (e.g.,α, β, ..) for the Q subset. In this notation
τ (r)
Jα are all of order ǫ and small. We now write out equations (3) with initial
conditions (7) for the full Hilbert space. Solutions of these exist, since the
curl-condition in (8) is satisﬁed for the full Hilbert-space. Explicitly, (3)
reads as follows:

AJK,r + τ (r)

JM AM K + τ (r)

Jα AαK = 0

for derivatives fully within P , and

AαK,r + τ (r)

αM AM K + τ (r)

αβ AβK = 0

(33)

(34)

for the inter - P Q matrix element derivatives, and a further equation (which
will not be of interest to us) for the intra-Q derivative matrix elements.

convergence of the Taylor series (which is assumed to hold close to the initial
point).

Summarizing, subject to the assumption of small (though not neces-
sarily zero) inter-P Q non-adiabatic coupling and analyticity of the matrix
elements, the original procedure of Ref. [11] restricted to a ﬁnite dimensional
set (P ) is approximately valid, and correct to order ǫ2, no matter that the
compatibility conditions are not exactly satisﬁed. Earlier, it was shown, for
the model discussed here, that the discrepancy in the compatibility condi-
tions (8) is ǫ2 (e.g., Ref. [5, 9]); our result establishes the magnitude of error
in the solution.

The ﬁrst term in the right hand side of the above equation is proportional to
τ (rm)
αM and its derivatives, and thus by assumption is of order ǫ. The second
term in the right hand side of the above equation contains derivatives up
to order N
1 of AβK and thus by the assumption of the induction is also
of order ǫ. Thus we established that the right hand side of equation (40)
is of order ǫ and also AαK,r1...rN (

The ﬁrst term in the right hand side of the above equation contains intra-P
terms which are not considered corrections. The second term in the right
hand side of the above equation, which is considered a correction term,
contains derivatives up to order N
1 of AβK , which are of order ǫ according
to the theorem established above. When multiplied by derivatives of τ (rm)
αM
which are of order ǫ by our assumptions, the correction terms obtained is
thus of order ǫ2 for N. Thus the result holds for any N , which is what we
have set out to prove.

5 An Analogy

Very frequently one has a complicated Hamiltonian H, which has non- zero
matrix elements Hnm between the components (designated n and m) in an
extended Hilbert space. For many practical purposes, e.g.
for numerical
work, one uses a restricted, ﬁnite set (belonging to the P subset of the
Hilbert space), such that P -Q matrix elements of the Hamiltonian are small.
The procedure of solving the Schr¨odinger equation in this manner can be
formally written as:

HP = EP P

where, as before, P is a projection operator and EP represents the set
of eigenvalues corresponding to the set of solutions thus obtained. Pre-
multiplication with Q, gives

(44)

(45)

QHP = EP QP = 0

12

since P and Q are disjoint. This implies that the procedure requires, for
consistency, that QHP = 0, or that there be no matrix elements Hnm of
the Hamiltonian connecting the Q and P sets. While this is, in general, a
true requirement for exact solutions, in practice, when one seeks meaning-
ful approximate results, one is content with the smallness of these matrix
elements. We have here a further example of a rigorous condition being
inconsistent with an approximate method.

6 Conclusion

In section 2 we have seen that for adiabatic electronic wave functions in
the form of Mathieu functions the compatibility (or curl) conditions are not
satisﬁed but, by successively enlarging the ﬁnite set, the conditions can be
satisﬁed to increasingly better accuracy. As previously shown in (e.g.) [5]
Eq.
(2.54), a non-zero curl gives rise to a ”gauge ﬁeld tensor, the non-
Abelian analog of the electromagnetic ﬁeld”, also called the Yang-Mills ﬁeld
[18]. The use of Mathieu functions will thus enable a systematic study of
the properties of this ﬁeld in a molecular physical context [19].

We then discussed the question of the existence of a ﬁnite sized ADT
matrix A (which is distinct from the question of its uniqueness or single val-
uedness), being the solution of a ﬁnite number of partial diﬀerential equa-
tions that fail to satisfy compatibility conditions. We have started with a
complete set, for which the existence of solution is assured. Under condi-
tions that the nonadiabatic coupling with the exterior of the set is small, we
have truncated the size of the set and removed part of the ﬁnite sized ADT
matrix A. The compatibility conditions are not met within the ﬁnite set,
but the remainder of A satisﬁes the original diﬀerential equation approxi-
mately, namely to an accuracy which goes as the square of the neglected
nonadiabatic coupling. We conclude that the failure of the compatibility
conditions yet permits the existence of an approximate ADT matrix (sub-
ject to smallness of some nonadiabatic coupling terms).

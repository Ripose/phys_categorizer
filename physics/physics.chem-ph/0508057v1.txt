The equilibrium properties of classical LJ38 versus quantum Ne38 Lennard-Jones clusters are inves-
tigated. The quantum simulations use both the Path-Integral Monte-Carlo (PIMC) and the recently
developed Variational-Gaussian-Wavepacket Monte-Carlo (VGW-MC) methods. The PIMC and the
classical MC simulations are implemented in the parallel tempering framework. The classical heat
capacity Cv(T ) curve agrees well with that of Neirotti et al [J. Chem. Phys. 112, 10340 (2000)],
although a much larger conﬁning sphere is used in the present work. The classical Cv(T ) shows a
peak at about 6 K, interpreted as a solid-liquid transition, and a shoulder at ∼4 K, attributed to a
solid-solid transition involving structures from the global octahedral (Oh) minimum and the main
icosahedral (C5v) minimum. The VGW method is used to locate and characterize the low energy
states of Ne38, which are then further reﬁned by PIMC calculations. Unlike the classical case, the
ground state of Ne38 is a liquid-like structure. Among the several liquid-like states with energies
below the two symmetric states (Oh and C5v), the lowest two exhibit strong delocalization over
basins associated with at least two classical local minima. Because the symmetric structures do not
play an essential role in the thermodynamics of Ne38, the quantum heat capacity is a featureless
curve indicative of the absence of any structural transformations. Good agreement between the two
methods, VGW and PIMC, is obtained. The present results are also consistent with the predictions
by Calvo et al [J. Chem. Phys. 114, 7312 (2001)] based on the Quantum Superposition Method
within the harmonic approximation. However, because of its approximate nature, the latter method
leads to an incorrect assignment of the Ne38 ground state as well as to a signiﬁcant underestimation
of the heat capacity.

INTRODUCTION.

In this paper, we investigate equilibrium properties of
the Ne38 Lennard-Jones (LJ) cluster. Particularly, we
are interested in how the equilibrium structure, energy,
and heat capacity as functions of temperature are af-
fected by the quantum nature of the system. Our inter-
est is partly motivated by recent advances in the develop-
ment of accurate numerical Quantum Statistical Mechan-
ics techniques as well as by their successful applications
to smaller Lennard-Jones clusters. As such, Refs. [1] re-
port fully converged heat capacity curves obtained by
the Path-Integral Monte-Carlo (PIMC) method for vari-
ous Ar13−nNen Lennard-Jones clusters. The LJ13 cluster
is one of the smallest that exhibits a pronounced liquid-
solid-like structural transition, according to the existence
of a peak in the heat capacity curve Cv(T ). On the other
hand, Ne13 is perhaps the largest Ne cluster treated so far
quantum mechanically on the entire range of interesting
temperatures [1, 2].

In the case of Ar or heavier rare gas clusters, the quan-
tum eﬀects can safely be treated as small perturbations
[3]. However, it has long been known that the Ne clusters
exhibit strong quantum eﬀects, not only in the low tem-
perature regime, but also in liquid phase [4]. Still, per-
haps because 7 and 13 are magic numbers, the quantum
eﬀects do not essentially change the structural or ther-

∼

modynamic properties of the respective Ne clusters. For
example, although the heat capacity Cv(T ) around the
“solid-liquid” transition temperature (T
10 K) is re-
duced in magnitude and shifted about 10% toward lower
temperatures as compared with the purely classical LJ13,
the heat capacity curve for Ne13 has a behavior similar to
that of LJ13. It would certainly be interesting to verify
whether the quantum eﬀects lead or not to qualitative
diﬀerences for larger Ne clusters, especially those that do
not have a magic number of particles. Of particular in-
terest is the Ne38 cluster, for which there is the additional
question of whether or not the quantum ground state is
still localized in the celebrated octahedral basin, a basin
that contains the classical global minimum [5] and which
represents a deviation from the icosahedral Mackay pack-
ing characteristic of all the other neighboring clusters [6].

An attempt to answer these questions for a variety of
rare gas LJ clusters (including Ne38) has been made by
Calvo, Doye, and Wales [3], using various approxima-
tions, particularly, the quantum superposition method.
In this approximation, one treats all the classical min-
ima of the potential energy surface independently and
within an harmonic approximation. Quite interestingly,
the technique predicts the absence of the solid-liquid
transition peak in the heat capacity curve for the quan-
tum Ne38 cluster. Also, it suggests that the global mini-
mum is no longer localized in the octahedral basin. How-

ever, although many of the conclusions of Ref. [3] remain
qualitatively unchanged, we have found that the energy
estimates given by the harmonic approximation in this
case are unacceptably inaccurate. For instance, the har-
monic approximation incorrectly assigns the ground state
to a state from the icosahedral basin (state 4 from Ta-
ble I) that turns out to have an energy about 24.6 kBK
greater than the octahedral-based structure, invalidating
the conclusions of Ref. [3]. Nevertheless, we still ﬁnd that
the conﬁgurations of minimum quantum-mechanical en-
ergy are indeed disordered, liquid-like structures localized
in the icosahedral basin. Yet, it is clear that techniques
that are more sophisticated than the Quantum Superpo-
sition Method must be utilized for a reliable study of the
thermodynamic and structural properties of the Ne clus-
ters. As Calvo, Doye, and Wales acknowledge, it would
be desirable if their results could be veriﬁed by more ac-
curate simulations, although they note: “It is very likely
that simulating LJ31 or LJ38 by quantum Monte Carlo
methods at thermal equilibrium is not practical with the
current computer technology.” We attempt to give a par-
tial answer to their challenge by utilizing two diﬀerent
quantum algorithms, both of which have been shown to
accurately treat the smaller Ne13 cluster [1, 7].

in principle,

The ﬁrst algorithm is a random series based PIMC
is an exact
technique [8, 9, 10] which,
method.
It must be realized though that an accurate
computation of the heat capacity is a more demanding
task for PIMC than the evaluation of the average en-
ergy, for instance. Even for the latest heat capacity es-
timators [1], the standard deviation still grows as fast as
T −2, when the temperature is lowered (the prediction is
a theoretical upper bound; in practice, we have always
observed an improved behavior, closer to T −1). At the
same time, the heat capacity itself decreases at a rate
following perhaps a polynomial law for a large range of
low temperatures [3] (of course, after removing the part
associated with the translational degrees of freedom, the
decrease is exponentially fast in the extreme low tem-
perature limit, due to the ﬁnite number of particles in
the cluster). Thus, the relative error increases rather
severely at low temperatures. Other limitations of the
PIMC method come from the increase in the numerical
eﬀort associated with the larger number of path vari-
ables needed for low temperatures as well as from the
sampling diﬃculties related to the larger number of path
variables. However, the latter kind of limitations are sur-
mountable, either by employing path integral techniques
having faster asymptotic convergence [9, 11] or by em-
ploying better sampling strategies [10, 12]. Most likely,
the biggest gain will come from the design of better heat
capacity estimators. To cope with ergodicity problems,
the path integral technique has been utilized in conjunc-
tion with the parallel tempering procedure [13], in which
a number of Metropolis walks at diﬀerent temperatures
are utilized, with the conﬁgurations generated by walks
with similar temperatures swapped periodically.

In Refs. [7, 14] a novel method (VGW-MC) using varia-

2

tional Gaussian wavepackets in conjunction with a Monte
Carlo sampling of the initial conditions was developed
and tested for various benchmark systems including the
Ne13 Lennard-Jones cluster. The original Heller’s idea of
using the VGW’s for approximate solution of the time-
dependent Schr¨odinger equation [15, 16] was later fol-
lowed by many groups. Some important, but certainly
not complete references are [17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23,
24, 25]. While most of the developments were concerned
with the real-time dynamics, the work of Metiu and co-
workers [19], where the VGW’s were adapted to the solu-
tion of the “imaginary-time” Schr¨odinger equations, most
closely relates to the present VGW-MC method.

The VGW-MC is a manifestly approximate quantum
statistical mechanics approach, which is supposed to be
exact only in the high temperature limit or for a purely
harmonic system. Quite surprisingly, the results ob-
tained by this method for general strongly unharmonic
systems turned out to be very accurate, even at low tem-
peratures. For example, in the case of the Ne13 cluster,
nearly quantitative agreement with the existing PIMC
calculations was achieved for the heat capacity and equi-
librium structural properties. Although the method does
employ Monte Carlo sampling, its convergence proper-
ties at low temperatures are completely diﬀerent from
those in the parallel tempering Monte Carlo schemes: the
initial conditions for the Gaussian wavepackets are sam-
pled by a primitive Metropolis walk running at an inverse
temperature β = βMC suﬃciently small to ensure ergod-
icity. Each Gaussian is then propagated to the higher
values of β making its contribution to the partition func-
tion. Thus, a single Metropolis walk is used to obtain
results for the entire temperature range of interest, also
circumventing the quasi-ergodicity problems at low tem-
peratures. As argued and demonstrated in Ref. [7], it is
the quantum nature of the Ne system which ensures the
convergence of the method, a convergence that, at ﬁrst
glance, may seem completely counterintuitive. Some nu-
merical aspects of the VGW-MC method still remain to
be explored in the future. Those include the use of more
eﬃcient sampling strategies. For instance, the method
can be implemented in the parallel tempering fashion if
needed. However, since the numerical scheme, as de-
scribed in Ref. [7], worked for the present case of the
Ne38 cluster, no attempts to optimize its performance
were made here. Thus, in the present study, the com-
putations are done using both parallel tempering PIMC
and VGW-MC. The latter approach seems to have bet-
ter convergence properties at low temperatures, while the
former is manifestly exact (when the statistical errors can
be made suﬃciently small).

The double-funnel topology of the potential energy sur-
face of the LJ38 cluster [26] has proved a tough simulation
challenge for most of the Monte Carlo algorithms. This
challenge has only recently been answered by Neirotti
and coworkers [27], who have employed the parallel tem-
pering algorithm to successfully simulate a LJ38 clus-
ter conﬁned by a hard-wall potential with a radius of

Rc = 2.25 σLJ. Extensive studies made by Neirotti and
coworkers have shown that the parallel tempering algo-
rithm in the canonical ensemble cannot equilibrate the
LJ38 cluster in about 100 million passes through the con-
ﬁguration space, if the original Lee, Barker, and Abra-
ham [28] conﬁning radius of Rc = 3.612 σLJ is utilized.
However, they have argued that the thermodynamics of
the cluster remains basically unchanged if a smaller con-
ﬁning radius of Rc = 2.25 σLJ is utilized.

For the quantum Ne38 cluster the conﬁning radius
of Rc = 2.25σLJ is perhaps too small. For instance,
the radius of the conﬁguration proposed in Ref. [3] as
a ground state for the Ne cluster (state 4 in Table 1)
is Rc = 2.255σLJ, after quenching to the closest clas-
sical minimum. Clearly, such a state would have been
made inaccessible by the small conﬁning radius utilized
by Neirotti et al. In the present work, we utilize a con-
ﬁning potential in the form of a steep polynomial, which
is more suitable for quantum simulations. It has been ar-
gued that, for such an analytical form of the conﬁning po-
tential, a larger conﬁning radius of at least Rc = 2.65 σLJ
is necessary in order to ensure that the low-temperature
thermodynamic properties of the classical cluster are not
signiﬁcantly altered [29]. For quantum systems, one
needs to worry about the possibility that the eﬀects of
quantum delocalization may lead to an even stronger in-
ﬂuence of the conﬁning radius on the structural proper-
ties of the Ne38 cluster. Thus, in the present study we
have decided to employ the original conﬁning radius of
Rc = 3.612 σLJ.
In making this choice, we have been
also motivated by the preliminary ﬁndings that the large
quantum eﬀects, through raising the zero-point energies
and barrier tunneling, radically reduce the diﬃculty of
the sampling problem. Yet, we had to make sure that
the thermodynamic and structural changes observed are
solely due to quantum eﬀects and not to the larger con-
ﬁning radius employed. For this reason, we have started
our investigation with a Monte Carlo simulation for the
classical LJ38 cluster, which is presented in the following
section.

II. PARALLEL TEMPERING SIMULATION OF
THE LJ38 CLUSTER

As discussed in the Introduction, the ﬁrst successful
attempts [27] to compute the thermodynamic properties
of the LJ38 cluster by parallel tempering simulations have
revealed the diﬃculty in attaining ergodicity. The LJ38
cluster has a double-funnel topology of the potential en-
ergy surface [26], with the octahedral and icosahedral
basins separated by a large-energy barrier. The way par-
allel tempering [13] tries to overcome the high-energy
barrier is by coupling a set of statistically independent
Monte Carlo Markov chains via exchanges of conﬁgura-
tions between replicas of slightly diﬀerent temperatures.
The swapping events by themselves do not lead to new
conﬁgurations. Rather, the conﬁgurations from the low-

3

temperature replicas climb the ladder of temperatures
and reach the high-temperature replicas, where they are
destroyed and replaced with energetically more favorable
conﬁgurations.

The rate of equilibration of the parallel-tempering sim-
ulation depends on the ability of the high-temperature
Metropolis walkers to jump between the icosahedral and
the octahedral basins with a suﬃciently high frequency.
Let us mention that, although they have enough energy
to do so, the replicas of highest temperature must defeat
the action of the entropy, which favors the conﬁgurations
from the icosahedral basin or, beyond the melting point,
the conﬁgurations that are associated with the liquid
phase. At high temperature, the number of local minima
that become thermodynamically accessible increases as
exp(αN ) (not counting the permutationally symmetric
∼
conﬁgurations), with the dimensionality N of the cluster
[30]. Therefore, the ability of the high-temperature repli-
cas to ﬁnd conﬁgurations in the octahedral basin (the
basin associated with the global minimum) is quite low
and decreases further if the vapor pressure of the cluster
is decreased, for instance, by increasing the conﬁning ra-
dius. As such, the ﬁnding of Neirotti et al [27] that the
system is hard to equilibrate even in 100 million passes
must not necessarily come as a surprise.

The Lennard-Jones parameters utilized in this paper
are those employed in previous studies of Ne clusters [1]:
ǫLJ = 35.6 K and σLJ = 2.749 A. The mass of Ne atom
In both classical and
was assumed to be m = 20 a.u.
PIMC simulations, we have employed the same analytical

Here, Rcm is the center of mass, whereas Rc = 3.612 σLJ
is the conﬁning radius. Recent studies performed by
Sabo, Freeman, and Doll [29] have demonstrated that
low-temperature thermodynamic properties of the clus-
ter may be sensitive not only to the exact value of the
conﬁning radius, but also to the shape of the potential.
Because the polynomial potential is not suﬃciently ﬂat
when compared to a hard-
for small values of
k
wall potential, a radius of at least Rc = 2.65 σLJ must
be utilized in order to prevent the disappearance of the
pre-melting solid-solid phase change [29]. However, be-
yond this radius, the vapor pressure depends only slightly
on the exact value of the conﬁning radius, for a large
range of such values. The low-temperature thermody-
namic properties and, to a good extent, the properties
of the liquid phase remain invariant to the exact value
of the conﬁning radius. Nevertheless, the conﬁning ra-
dius of Rc = 2.65 σLJ, which is a minimal requirement
for a classical cluster, is no longer satisfactory for the
quantum Ne38 cluster, whence our decision to employ
the signiﬁcantly larger Lee, Barker, and Abraham value
of Rc = 3.612 σLJ appears justiﬁed, although not com-
putationally optimal in the sense of Ref. [29].

We have employed exactly the same parallel tempering

FIG. 1: Evolution of the heat capacity proﬁles for the LJ38
cluster during the parallel tempering Monte Carlo simulation.
Each of the six curves has been computed by collecting av-
erages for successive groups of 50 million passes. Early on
in the simulation, the heat capacity shows a fake maximum
at low temperatures, maximum that is gradually washed out
and transformed in a “shoulder.” The last two curves are vir-
tually indistinguishable on the plot and the data utilized to
compute them have also been employed for the ﬁnal result.

strategy as the one from Neirotti et al [27], except for a
larger number of parallel replicas, 64 instead of 40, which
have been arranged in a geometric progression spanning
the interval of temperatures [1.0 K, 12.46 K]. As such, we
do not describe the technique here and, instead, refer the
reader to the cited reference. To begin with, we have per-
formed a ﬁrst simulation in 100 million sweeps (passes)
through the conﬁguration space, which were preceded by
20 million warming steps. The sweeps have been divided
in blocks of 5 million each. Rather than using all 20
blocks to compute the heat capacity, we have calculated
two heat capacity curves, each using 10 blocks of data.
This approach allows us to evaluate the convergence of
the simulation. The two curves are those from Fig. 1 that
exhibit a clearly deﬁned low-temperature maximum, ad-
ditional to the one associated with the solid-liquid tran-
sition.

The appearance of the fake low-temperature peak in
the heat capacity curves early in the simulation tells us
a lot about how parallel tempering works. Such peaks
are due to solid-solid transitions between the conﬁgu-
rations from the octahedral and the icosahedral basins,
transitions that lead to large energy ﬂuctuations. The
transitions between the replicas are achieved through the
replica exchange mechanism. Because at the beginning
of the simulation only a few octahedral conﬁgurations
have been found, a low temperature replica is forced to
jump between octahedral and icosahedral conﬁgurations
through the exchange mechanism. As the simulation
goes on, more and more octahedral conﬁgurations are
found. Because they are energetically more stable, they
are placed in the replicas of lower energy. These low-
temperature replicas are involved more and more only

In the
lower panel, the derivative against temperature is given. As
explained by Neirotti and coworkers [27], the small low tem-
perature maximum in the derivative curve is associated with
a second order solid-solid phase transition between the con-
ﬁgurations from the octahedral and icosahedral basins.

in exchanges of conﬁgurations from the octahedral basin
and their energy ﬂuctuations decrease: the fake heat ca-
pacity peak moves to higher temperatures.

The mechanism described in the preceding paragraph
also implies that the rate of equilibration of the parallel
tempering simulation can be estimated from the rate at
which the fake maxima move to the right. More precisely,
because the supply of newly found octahedral conﬁgura-
tions is steady, the peaks will move to the right roughly
at a constant rate until the heat capacity proﬁle reaches
the equilibrium shape. Based on this line of reasoning,
we have performed two more simulations of 100 million
passes, each preceded by 20 million warming sweeps, and
each starting from the last conﬁguration of the previ-
ous simulation. The four heat capacity curves generated
using the new data are also shown in Fig. 1, with the
last two being virtually indistinguishable. The data ob-
tained in the last 100 million passes have been utilized to
compute the heat capacity curve from Fig. 2. Thus, the
simulation has needed about 260 million passes for the
equilibration phase and only 100 million for the accumu-
lation phase.

The heat capacity curve obtained is almost identical

to the one computed by Neirotti and coworkers. Thus,
our simulation constitutes a direct proof of their asser-
tion that the constraining radius of Rc = 2.25σLJ is large
enough not to essentially change the low-temperature
thermodynamics of the cluster. On the other hand, our
simulation reveals a very important property of the par-
allel tempering algorithm. If the high-temperature repli-
cas are capable of ﬁnding the relevant conﬁgurations at a
reasonable rate, then the simulation will converge quite
quickly and it should not be stopped prematurely. Fu-
ture research in the development of replica exchange tech-
niques should be concerned with designing ways to iden-
tify which of the replicas generate the bottleneck conﬁg-
urations and how one can improve the rate at which the
conﬁgurations are generated.

In Fig. 3, we present the radial pair correlation func-
tions for diﬀerent temperatures. The shape of the func-
tions changes as the temperature is lowered from T =
10 K, which contains conﬁgurations characteristic of the
liquid phase, to T = 6 K, which mainly contains struc-
tures from the icosahedral basin, and ﬁnally to T = 2 K,
which mainly contains structures from the octahedral
conﬁgurations. The association of the shape of the ra-
dial pair correlation functions with the respective con-
ﬁgurations is based upon the analysis of several order
parameters performed by Neirotti and coworkers. (Also
see below the comparison of classical and quantum p(r)
of the same symmetries.)

III. THE PATH INTEGRAL MONTE CARLO
TECHNIQUE

It has been long recognized that the computation of
heat capacities by path integral Monte Carlo techniques
is quite diﬃcult, due to the strong decrease in the heat ca-
pacity with the decrease in the temperature. Our ability
to report well-converged PIMC results for relatively low
temperatures (down to 1.78 K for the Ne38 cluster) relies
on recent developments in the design of direct path inte-
gral techniques (techniques that solely call the potential
function for the evaluation of physical properties). Such
developments include: short-time approximations having
faster asymptotic convergence [9], more eﬃcient sampling
techniques [10], and thermodynamic energy and heat ca-
pacity estimators having lower variances [1, 8]. Because
the PIMC technique has been extensively described in
the cited references, here, we only enumerate its salient
features.

is as fast as O(1/n4). These parameters are universal,
in the sense that they are independent of the choice of
potential V (x), and are given in Ref. [9], reference that
should be consulted for further information. Here, we
only mention that the short-time approximation intro-
duces additional path variables. The total number of
path variables for the diagonal elements of the n-th or-
der Lie-Trotter product is 4n + 4, which is the number
we report. The number of evaluations of the potential
function necessary to compute the action for a particu-
lar path parameterized by the 4n + 4 path variables is
also 4n + 4. Therefore, the computational eﬀort relative
to the number of path variables is the same as for the
trapezoidal Trotter approximation, yet the technique has
a superior asymptotic convergence, O(1/n4), as opposed
to O(1/n2).

The Monte Carlo procedure is based on the fast sam-
pling algorithm. As observed in Ref. [10], updating more

than a few path variables at a time in a Metropolis step
results in a decrease in the maximal displacements that
is proportional to the square root of the number of path
variables updated. The eﬀect is entropic in nature and
is roughly independent of the amount of correlation be-
tween the variables that are sampled. On the other hand,
if the variables are updated separately, one needs to per-
form 4n + 4 potential evaluations for each of the 4n + 4
variables.
It has been argued that the number of po-
tential evaluations for an eﬃcient update of the path
variables scales as (4n + 4)2, regardless of the strategy
utilized. The fast sampling algorithm is based on the ob-
servation that, if n = 2k
1, then the 4n + 4 variables
can be divided in 4 + log2(n + 1) layers, with the path
variables from each layer being statistically independent.
With a single evaluation of the action, one can update
all variables from a layer, independently. Therefore, the
cost to update all path variables in a statistically eﬃcient
manner is (n + 1)[4 + log2(n + 1)], a signiﬁcantly better
scaling.

−

×

Numerical experiments have shown that the number
of path variables necessary to achieve systematic errors
comparable to the statistical errors is 4n + 4 = 256. The
256 = 2560 poten-
number of layers is 10. A total of 10
tial evaluations are needed to eﬃciently update each of
the path variables associated with a given degree of free-
dom. Similar to the Monte Carlo simulation for the clas-
sical system, the path variables corresponding to diﬀer-
ent particles are updated separately. We have randomly
selected a particle and a layer and updated the corre-
sponding path variables. It follows that a pass or sweep
through the conﬁguration space requires 38
10 = 380
elementary Metropolis steps. The simulation employed
for the computation of the heat capacity curve has con-
sisted of 100 accumulation blocks of 2 thousand passes
each. The accumulation phase has been preceded by 50
equilibration blocks. The Monte Carlo replicas corre-
sponding to diﬀerent temperatures have been involved in
exchanges of conﬁgurations each 2 passes, according to
the parallel tempering algorithm. We have employed a
number of 64 independent replicas of temperatures ar-
ranged in a geometric progression spanning the inter-
val [1.78 K, 12.46 K]. The observed acceptance rates for
replica exchanges were larger than 40%.

×

The thermodynamic energy and heat capacity estima-
tors are those obtained by formal diﬀerentiation of the
Lie-Trotter formula [8]. The temperature diﬀerentiation
can be performed by a central ﬁnite-diﬀerence scheme
requiring three points [1]. Thus, the overall computa-
tional eﬀort for the quantum simulation is a factor of

2560 = 7680 larger than for the classical simula-
tion, per Monte Carlo sweep. Fortunately, because of
the extensive quantum eﬀects, one does not need so many
passes as for the classical simulation. In fact, as our later
results show, the conﬁgurations associated with the oc-
tahedral basin, which contains the classical global min-
imum, have an unfavorable quantum energy. The eﬀec-
tive topology of the potential energy surface is drastically

×

simpliﬁed, with the octahedral basin being almost com-
pletely taken out of the picture. Therefore, the ergodicity
problems observed for the classical simulation do not ap-
pear in the case of the quantum simulation.

In addition to the main Monte Carlo simulation, we
have performed several Monte Carlo simulations at the
ﬁxed temperature of T = 1.78 K, in order to estimate the
average energy of the conﬁgurations of minimal energy
from Table I. These simulations have utilized 4 parallel
streams of 50 blocks each, for a total of 200 accumulation
blocks. The accumulation phase has been preceded by 25
equilibration blocks. The simulations have been started
from the centers of the Gaussian wavepackets of minimal
energy that were obtained during the VGW simulation.
We did not utilize parallel tempering for these simula-
tions because globally ergodic walkers would eventually
leave the starting conﬁgurations and move to entropically
more favorable conﬁgurations. Only through broken er-
godicity can we meaningfully associate the estimated en-
ergies with the input conﬁgurations. To verify the asso-
ciation, we have quenched several of the ﬁnal positions
of the simulated conﬁgurations.
In all cases, we have
recovered with a high probability (over 50%) the initial
conﬁgurations. However, for both of the conﬁgurations
1 and 2, we have obtained another classical minimum,
the basin of which was frequently visited. Thus, at least
for the temperature of 1.78 K, the conﬁgurations of low-
est energy are delocalized over basins associated with at
least two classical minima.

The most ﬂexible form for the variational wavepacket
is the fully-coupled Gaussian (full matrix G).
In this
case, the numerical eﬀort to solve the equations of mo-
tion (10) for the Gaussian parameters scales as N 3. The
extended acronym for the corresponding version of the
method is FC-VGW. A more approximate but computa-
tionally less intensive version (SP-VGW) employs single-
particle variational Gaussian wavepackets corresponding
3 real
to a block-diagonal matrix G, each block being a 3
symmetric matrix representing a single particle. This re-
sults in 9N independent dynamical variables contained
N 2 numerical
in the arrays q and G and leads to the

×

∼

6
∼

N 2 terms in the poten-
scaling, which is due to the
tial energy. Although both FC-VGW and SP-VGW are
approximations, only the former gives exact results for
general quadratic multidimensional potentials. Also, in
the SP-VGW approximation, the motion of the center
of mass is not separable. However, as demonstrated in
Ref. [7], in the case of the Ne13 Lennard-Jones cluster,
the two methods give quite similar results for the heat
capacity, results that agree very well with those obtained
by PIMC.

The integral in Eq. 6 is most eﬃciently computed by
the Monte Carlo method. The sampling strategy em-
ployed in the present work is as in Ref. [7]. The con-
ﬁgurations sampled by a single Metropolis random walk
at a suﬃciently high temperature TMC (= 1/kβMC) are
utilized to produce Z = Z(T ) for the entire temperature
interval of interest (T < TMC). That is, given the se-
(n = 1, ...NMC) sampled according to the
quence
probability distribution function K(q(n)
; βMC), the par-
tition function for the temperature T is computed with
the help of the formula

As extensively discussed and demonstrated in Ref. [7],
for a strongly quantum system as the Ne cluster, this
expression converges for all temperatures T < TMC.
This may seem to contradict the general experience with
Monte Carlo simulations, as one expects the ensembles
for diﬀerent temperatures T and TMC to be quite diﬀer-
ent, fact that could potentially result in poor sampling.
Despite this, Eq. 18 converges well. The explanation
is that the entire Gaussian distribution, which is broad
at the high temperature TMC, shrinks when the Gaus-
sians are propagated to lower temperatures (the Gaus-
sians fall into the potential wells). Therefore, at all
temperatures T = 1/kβ, the Gaussians parameterized
by G(β/2), q(β/2), and γ(β/2) are representative of the
physically relevant region of the conﬁguration space.

V. THE GROUND STATE OF Ne38 HAS
LIQUID-LIKE STRUCTURE.

The global potential energy minimum of the LJ38 clus-
ter is a truncated octahedron with energy Ecl(Oh) =
162.943 kBK. (Here and throughout the paper the en-
−
ergy is reported as the energy-per-atom.) The next-
in-energy local minimum is also a symmetric struc-
ture, namely an incomplete Mackay icosahedron with
Ecl(C5v) =
162.310 kBK. For the corresponding quan-
tum system, it is natural to expect the ground state en-
ergy to be one of these symmetric structures. On the
other hand, the symmetric minima have the stiﬀest po-
tential, which, for suﬃciently large values of the quantum
delocalization parameter Λ = ~/σLJ√mǫLJ, may result
in high zero-point energies (ZPE). As such, the Harmonic

−

8

Approximation (HA) [3] predicts that one of the disor-
dered Mackay-based local potential minima that would
be assigned to a liquid-like structure in the classical simu-
lations (State 4 in Table I) has the lowest ZPE. As argued
in Ref.
[3], this eﬀect may also be accompanied by the
disappearance of the solid-liquid peak in the heat capac-
ity curve. This was conﬁrmed by calculations using the
Quantum Superposition Method for Ne38, also within the
HA. Incidentally, more accurate energy estimations (see
below) show that the accuracy of the HA is not suﬃcient
to make a reliable prediction of the ground state energy
In fact, Eqm(4) > Eqm(Oh), Eqm(C5v)
and structure.
(See Table I), i.e., the state 4 has relatively high en-
ergy. Moreover, because of the strong delocalization of
the eigenstates of Ne38 over more than one classical min-
ima (see below), the applicability of the HA seems ques-
tionable. However, from what follows, the main qualita-
tive conclusions of Ref. [3] remain correct.

In the present work, the procedure to search for the
quantum ground state consists of ﬁrst generating a long
classical Metropolis walk at the temperature T=11.5 K
(at which the random walk is ergodic). Every once
in 5000 classical MC steps, a conﬁguration q0 is se-
lected to set the initial conditions to propagate the vari-
ational Gaussian wavepacket in imaginary time to τ = 1
(kBK)−1, using the single-particle representation (SP-
VGW). During its propagation the energy of the VGW
is computed using

If the low-temperature state has suﬃciently low energy it
is further propagated to τ = 5 (kBK)−1, at which point
the VGW becomes nearly stationary. If this state is dis-
tinguishable from all the previously identiﬁed low energy
states, it is further reﬁned by propagating it in imaginary
time again to τ = 5 (kBK)−1, but now using the more
accurate FC-VGW.

It can be shown that in the τ

limit the Gaussian
state
Its energy then gives
an upper estimate of the ground state energy. For small
values of the quantum delocalization parameter Λ every
minimum of the potential energy results in its station-
ary Gaussian state. For large enough values of Λ, the
quantum state may be delocalized over a number of lo-
cal potential minima, which is expected to be the case
for the Ne system. This signiﬁcantly reduces the possi-
ble number of stationary states and, therefore, simpliﬁes
the search for the ground state compared to the global
optimization of the potential energy of the classical LJ38
cluster.

TABLE I: Energies per atom in units of kBK of the six con-
ﬁgurations discussed in the text estimated by ﬁve diﬀerent
methods. The error bars for the PIMC results (twice the
standard deviation) are all about 0.01kBK. In addition, the
ﬁnite MC temperature, T=1.78 K, leads to a systematic state-
independent shift of all the PIMC energies by about 0.1kBK.
States 1-4 have liquid-like structure with no particular sym-
metry. The classical minima for states 1, 2 and 3 were ob-
tained by quenching the quantum paths during the PIMC
simulations. States 1 and 2 gave each at least two diﬀerent
classical local minima.

In our calculations, a total of 106 Gaussians have been
generated. Out of those states, the three lowest energy
states were selected for further analysis. The results of
our ﬁndings are summarized in Tables I and II. We also
present the energy estimates for state 4, which was in-
correctly assigned to the ground state in Ref.
[3], based
on the harmonic approximation. These four states ap-
peared during the search many times with the hit rates
10−4, and 10−5, for
10−4, 2.8
being 1.6
states 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. Neither octahedral
(Oh) nor icosahedral (C5v) states were found during the
search. As pointed out by Neirotti et al [27], the fraction
of highly-symmetric structures having either Oh or C5v
symmetries is almost zero at the temperature of 11.5 K.
Thus, there is the real possibility that our simulation is
not ergodic with respect to the correct distribution of
conﬁgurations at lower temperatures.

To address this issue, we have produced the Oh and
C5v states by propagating the VGW starting from the
corresponding classical minima and veriﬁed that their en-
ergies are not the lowest. In addition, we have quenched
all the ﬁnal conﬁgurations obtained during the PIMC
simulation, at the level of the VGW theory. These

[1.78 K, 12.46 K], have also produced the conﬁgurations
2, 3, and 1 (in this order of abundance), as well as some
other conﬁgurations associated with the Metropolis walk-
ers of higher temperatures. The energies of the latter
states are, however, larger than those of states 1, 2, and
3. Quite interestingly, state 1, which we believe to be
the veritable ground state, was not as frequently visited
as state 2 during both the VGW and PIMC simulations.
Let us notice that the energies of these two states are very
close. Most likely, state 1 is not entropically favorable on
the interval of temperatures [1.78 K, 12.46 K]. However,
at even lower temperatures, we may expect state 1 to
become the dominant species in the thermodynamic en-
semble. Unfortunately, our results so far (see the next
section) are not capable to describe the low temperature
regime accurately enough to state whether or not the
transition from conﬁguration 2 to 1 is capable of produc-
ing a “shoulder” in the heat capacity curve.

In the context of the VGW approach, we found it suf-
ﬁcient and convenient to characterize the structure of a
stationary state by its radial pair correlation function,

which is computable with little numerical eﬀort [7]. The
use of angular-dependent distribution functions may be
more appropriate but is more complicated. In Fig. 4 we
present p(r) for the six stationary states from Table I.
Quite interestingly, for the liquid-like states 1-4, they are
nearly identical. Moreover, most stationary VGW states
found in our calculations had the radial distribution very
similar to that of state 1, while only a few states had p(r)
similar to that of the icosahedral state (C5v). No state
with octahedral-like order was ever found.

Perhaps a more convincing proof that the ground state
of the quantum Ne38 cluster corresponds to a disordered,

liquid-like state is the similarity between the radial dis-
tribution function of the quantum ground state and the
radial distribution function of the classical LJ38 system
at the temperature of 10 K (see Fig. 5). The latter sys-
tem is in liquid phase at 10 K, as apparent from Fig. 2.
(Note that the classical radial correlation function was
scaled using pscaled(r) = αp(r/α) with α = 0.97 in order
to take into account the inﬂation of the quantum system
relative to the classical one.)

Because it is more ﬂexible than the SP-VGW, the FC-
VGW provides a better approximation for the ground
state. While both approximations fail to correctly de-
scribe the low energy rotation of the cluster, the SP-
VGW does not correctly describe the translational mo-
tion. These are the obvious sources of the systematic
errors in the energy estimates using the Gaussian ap-
proximations. We found empirically that, for the FC-
VGW, the main contribution to the error in the mean
energy estimate E(T) is proportional to the system size
N and is nearly temperature-independent. This explains
the surprising agreement for the heat capacity estimate
Cv(T ) := ∂E(T )/∂T computed at the level of the FC-
VGW theory and well-converged PIMC results for the
Ne13 cluster [7].

Qualitatively, the status of the SP-VGW based approx-
imation is similar to that for the FC-VGW. However, the
systematic error is about twice as big. From Tables I
and II, we can see that the energies (per particle) of the
selected states estimated by SP-VGW are shifted by ap-
proximately 3 kBK per atom relative to those estimated
by the more accurate FC-VGW technique, independent
of the state. Also the SP-VGW gives diﬀerent energy
ordering for states 1, 2 and 3.

In order to verify the VGW results, we have also per-
formed low temperature PIMC calculations using the ini-

tial conditions deﬁned by the centroids of the correspond-
ing Gaussians. The simulation is explained in the last
paragraph of Section III and it has been conducted at
the temperature of T = 1.78 K. For each of the six cases
reported in Table I, during the course of the MC simu-
lation, the path was always localized in the same small
region of the conﬁguration space where it started. This
was checked by a quenching procedure which consisted
in ﬁnding the classical potential minimum nearest to the
quantum path (see Table I). Note that each of the two
lowest quantum states (1 and 2) have resulted in two close
minima upon quenching. For each of these two states we
checked that the VGW gave the same stationary state
when propagated from either of the two classical min-
ima. For state 1 the two classical minima are separated
by a barrier with height by an order of magnitude smaller
than the estimated value of the ZPE, implying that the
ground state must be delocalized over a region including
at least these two classical minima.

For the simulation temperature (1.78 K) utilized in the
PIMC calculations, the state energies are systematically
overestimated by about 0.1 kBK per atom. The latter
error estimate was obtained by investigating the temper-
ature dependence of the corresponding VGW energies.

The discrepancy between the PIMC and the FC-VGW
energies is about 3 kBK, independent of the state, which
supports our previous observation. This is clearly seen
in Table II, which gives the energies with respect to the
ground state energy. That is, after the subtraction of
the systematic errors, the agreement between the two
methods is quite remarkable.

In Fig.

6, we compare the radial pair correlation
function for state 1 computed by FC-VGW and PIMC.
The good agreement between the two results is another
demonstration of the reliability of the FC-VGW method.

VI. HEAT CAPACITIES FOR THE QUANTUM
NE38 LENNARD-JONES CLUSTER.

For the heat capacity calculations, we employed the
less expensive SP-VGW version of the method, which
proved to be suﬃciently accurate for this purpose [7]. As
for the classical simulations, the same conﬁning radius of
Rc = 3.612σLJ is used here.

The results for the entire temperature range (1 K
< T < 11.5 K) were obtained within a single MC cal-
culation using TMC = 11.5 K. The standard Metropolis
algorithm was implemented using 25% acceptance rate.
Every new Gaussian was sampled by randomly shifting
one of the atoms. Then this Gaussian, with the ini-
tial conditions deﬁned by Eq. 11 at the initial inverse
temperature τ0 = 10−4(kBK)−1, was propagated up to
τ = 1/2kBTMC, where its acceptance probability was
evaluated and realized according to the Metropolis proce-
dure. Once a Gaussian wavepacket is accepted, it is fur-
ther propagated up to τ = 0.5(kBK)−1, in order to cover
the remaining temperature range of interest. The total
107.
number of accepted Gaussian wavepackets was 3
The calculations were performed on a 12-processor 1.4
GHz Opteron cluster. The cpu time on a single processor
was about 0.5 seconds per accepted Gaussian wavepacket.
The results for both the SP-VGW and PIMC simula-
tions are shown in Figs. 7 and 8. The results for the
latter technique are for the interval [1.78 K, 12.46 K]. At
1 K, the PIMC technique would have required 512 path
variables and more parallel tempering replicas, which we
found rather expensive. The statistical errors for the
SP-VGW heat capacity were estimated by breaking the
whole calculation into two independent pieces consisting
107 MC steps each (see Fig. 8). Given the ex-
of 1.5
treme complexity of the system, the agreement between
the two methods is remarkable. Within statistical errors,
one may safely conclude that there are no peaks in the

caloric curve of the quantum Ne38 Lennard-Jones clus-
ter for the temperature regime considered. Less clear is
whether or not there is a shoulder in the low-temperature
portion of the heat capacity curve, shoulder that could
be assigned to a transition between conﬁgurations 1 and
2.

Finally, in Fig. 9, we show the radial pair correlation
functions computed by PIMC for several temperatures,
including that of state 1. As opposed to what happens
for the classical simulation (see Fig. 3), the quantum re-
sults clearly indicate that there is no abrupt change in
the equilibrium structure of Ne38, for the entire temper-
ature interval considered. For all temperatures consid-
ered, the quantum canonical ensemble for Ne38 consists
mainly of conﬁgurations that Neirotti and coworkers [27]
have identiﬁed as pertaining to the liquid phase.

VII. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

We have investigated several thermodynamic and
structural properties of the quantum Ne38 cluster using
two Monte Carlo techniques: the variational Gaussian-
wavepacket method and the path integral method. As
demonstrated by the results presented in the preceding
sections, the eﬀective topology of the potential energy
surface is strongly aﬀected by the quantum eﬀects. For
example, the highly-symmetric octahedral and icosahe-
dral conﬁgurations that dominate the low-temperature
classical canonical ensemble have negligible contribution
to the quantum canonical ensemble. The Ne38 cluster
is found to be essentially liquiﬁed for all temperatures
investigated.

The conﬁgurations of lowest quantum energy are delo-
calized over basins associated with at least two classical
local minima. This strong delocalization explains why
the Harmonic Approximation does not provide adequate
estimates for quantum energies. Moreover, perturbation

theory based on inclusion of the unharmonic terms would
not improve the results of the latter. For these techniques
to be even applicable, the quantum states must be well
localized around one classical minimum. The strong de-
localization is actually expected, given that 38 is not a
magic number. The incomplete layer over the icosahe-
dral core has high mobility and is strongly aﬀected by the
quantum eﬀects. As previous simulations for N = 7, 13
have shown, for magic numbers, the quantum eﬀects, al-
though strong, do not essentially change the shape of the
heat capacity curve.

An important conclusion of the present investigation
is that the quantum simulation techniques have matured
enough that rather complex system may be directly in-
vestigated. For the path integral technique utilized, fur-
ther work is necessary in order to provide better esti-
mates or criteria relating the quantum eﬀects to the num-
ber of path variables. Such criteria are important, for ex-
ample, in the context of parallel tempering. The present
simulation has utilized a number of 256 path variables
for the whole interval [1.78 K, 12.46 K]. However, a num-
ber of 32 path variables would have been enough for the
largest temperatures. The computational resources saved
would ﬁnd a better utilization in increasing the number
of Monte Carlo steps for the higher temperatures (at least

12

by a factor of 8). Criteria that could ensure a smooth as
well as adequate transition of the number of path vari-
ables with the temperature are highly desirable.

The variational Gaussian wavepacket technique has
demonstrated again its reliability, providing results con-
sistent with those obtained by path integral simulations.
Still, further work is necessary in order to improve the
convergence of the underlying Monte Carlo simulation.
Thus, the method must be adapted for use with parallel
tempering simulation techniques. Such an improvement
would avoid having to rely on the conﬁgurations gener-
ated by a single-temperature Monte Carlo walk.

It is worth mentioning that the two quantum simula-
tion techniques can be used together as complementary
tools, each having its particular strengths. The path inte-
gral technique has the advantage of being essentially ex-
act, provided enough computational resources are avail-
able. In the form it has been implemented in the present
application, it can be applied to the most general, many-
body potentials, for which the requirement of having an-
alytic expressions for the Gaussian integrals may not be
practical. The VGW technique is generally faster and
provides results that are more amenable to interpreta-
tion. It has also the advantage that it can be more easily
adapted for the study of quantum-dynamical properties,
if imaginary-time propagation of wavepackets is followed
by real-time propagation. As illustrated in the present
application, the VGW technique can be used to further
quench high-temperature path integral conﬁgurations to
temperatures so low that a direct path integral simula-
tion is not feasible.

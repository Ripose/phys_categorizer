Experimental studies on ion-water clusters have provided insights into the microscopic aspects
of hydration phenomena. One common view is that extending those experimental studies to larger
cluster sizes would give the single ion absolute hydration free energies not obtainable by classical
thermodynamic methods. This issue is reanalyzed in the context of recent computations and molec-
−
ular theories on ion hydration, particularly considering the hydration of H+, Li+, Na+, and HO
ions and thence the hydration of neutral ion pairs. The hydration free energies of neutral pairs
computed here are in good agreement with experimental results, whereas the calculated absolute
hydration free energies, and the excess chemical potentials, deviate consistently from some recently
tabulated hydration free energies based on ion-water cluster data. We show how the single ion
absolute hydration free energies are not separated from the potential of the phase in recent analyses
of ion-water cluster data, even in the limit of large cluster sizes. We conclude that naive calculations
on ion-water clusters ought to agree with results obtained from experimental studies of ion-water
clusters because both values include the contribution, somewhat extraneous to the local environment
of the ion, from the potential of the phase.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The interactions between the ions and inner shell wa-
ter molecules are much stronger than thermal energies
and typically display chemical complexities even in the
simplest cases [1, 2]. Computational chemistry and the
theories of solutions are approaching the stage that calcu-
lations on the free energies of ions in water must be taken
seriously. Despite this progress, there is still a non-trivial
level of confusion about what is to be learned from exper-
imental comparisons, particularly with comparisons de-
veloped from current experimental studies of ion-water
clusters. This paper attempts to provide guidance on
these issues by presenting a thermodynamic reconsidera-
tion of conclusions drawn from ion-water cluster experi-
ments, and results of recent molecular calculations.

Computational results are presented for aqueous ions
H+, Li+, Na+, and HO− which participate in a myriad
of biological processes [3]. These are common ions in
aqueous phase chemistry, and this is especially true for
H+ and HO−. These species also play a signiﬁcant role
in current problems such as the speciation of beryllium
metal in the environment [4] or in the lungs. Under-
standing beryllium speciation, and the development of
beryllium toxicity, is of substantial technological inter-
est, and would beneﬁt from a molecular understanding
of ion hydration phenomena.

Absolute hydration free energies, or equivalently sin-
gle ion activities, that we wish to clarify are not mea-
sureable by purely thermodynamic means [5, 6]; cor-
rect single ion activities will contain fundamental extra-
thermodynamical
information and hence their useful-
ness in thermodynamical analysis might be questioned.
Extra-thermodynamical, single ion activities, however,
are not unknowable (see [7] and [8]). Furthermore, that
knowledge would clarify the molecular understanding of
ion hydration, and permit a compact, tabulated consen-

sus of molecularly valid, experimental thermodynamic in-
formation.

The existing tables, for example [9, 10, 11], should nat-
urally be consistent in describing hydration free energies
for neutral combinations of ions, since those combina-
tions are thermodynamically measurable. But the align-
ment of those tables depends on extra-thermodynamical
information. An accurate determination of the properly
deﬁned single ion activity for any ion represented in those
tables would be suﬃcient to align those tables.
It has
been pointed out recently [12] that in favorable cases the
inaccuracies of computed single ion hydration free ener-
gies could probably be made less than the misalignments
in current tables of single ion hydration free energies.
The present paper pursues this possibility further.
Because simulated extra-thermodynamical

informa-
tion is available from molecular simulations, it is possible
to compute solely the work of coupling the ion with the
solvent in its locality, i.e., the absolute hydration free
energies of the ion separated from the contribution from
the potential of the phase (section II). Simulation results,
however, critically depend on parameterized molecular
models and on the treatment of electrostatic interactions.
Moreover, for many ions, particularly H+ and HO−, the
interactions with water are not easily described by con-
venient force-ﬁelds. This problem is circumvented by the
quasi-chemical theory of solutions, within which the ex-
cess chemical potential of the solute is partitioned into an
inner-sphere contribution, accounting for the chemistry
in the inner shell, and an outer-sphere contribution. This
latter contribution describes the interaction of the inner-
sphere quasi-component with the rest of the ﬂuid and
can usually be well described by simple force-ﬁeld mod-
els or dielectric continuum models. This quasi-chemical
approach has been used before to treat ions, such as, H+
[12], Li+[1], Na+[13], and HO−[14]. Chemical reactions
in solution, such as speciation of Fe3+[15] and Be2+[16],

are also well described.

In this article we bring together our earlier observa-
tions on the hydration of monovalent ions in conjunction
with classical force-ﬁeld based estimates of outer-sphere
contributions. The results so obtained for neutral ion
pairs are in good accord with experiments, but our sin-
gle ion values diﬀer consistently from current tabulations
based on cluster-ion hydration experiments.

Our plan for this report is as follows: First, we deﬁne
our problem and establish the notation we will use. We
then discuss the experimental studies leading to current
estimates of absolute hydration free energies of the ions.
After that, we present the quasi-chemical theory and our
computational results. Finally, we return to analyze the
experimental cluster-ion hydration results in this context.
In the last section we identify conclusions of this work.

II. ABSOLUTE HYDRATION FREE ENERGIES
OF IONS IN WATER

We will consider the chemical potentials of ionic solutes
in liquid water and we cast these chemical potentials in
the form

µM+ (w) = eφ(w)
+ RT ln
+ µM+ (w) .

ρM+ (w)ΛM+
(cid:2)

3

(cid:3)

(1)

This treats an ionic solute M+ suggested to be a metal ion
of charge e, but the notation here will be extended nat-
urally to anions X−. The qualiﬁer (w) in Eq. 1 indicates
the macroscopic phase to which this chemical potential,
or another quantity there, applies. Thus, ρM+ (w) is the
number density of M+ in a liquid water phase. (Though
we will be particularly interested in the case of liquid
water as a solvent, other cases must be permitted also
in the typical thermodynamic analysis.) The quantity
φ(w) is the electrostatic potential of the w phase. This
may be introduced on the basis of the principle that a
mean electric ﬁeld must be zero through interior regions
of a macroscopic conductor at equilibrium, and we will
use the language that φ(w) is the potential of the phase.
Only diﬀerences in these potentials between phases will
be involved, however, in our analysis. The quantity ΛM+
is the thermal deBroglie wavelength for the species M+,
a known function of the internal characteristics of an M+
ion, and of the temperature T , but with no dependences
of further thermodynamic relevence. (The standard state
adopted by Eq. 1 is sometimes referred to as the Ben-
Naim standard state.)

Finally, µM+(w) is the object of the present study. It
depends on temperature, pressure, and composition of
the system. In the limit of vanishing solute concentra-
tion we will call it the absolute hydration free energy of
M+. We are principally interested in standard temper-
ature and pressure conditions. As Eq. 1 is formulated,
µM+ (w) depends on the energetic interactions of solution

2

constituents, i.e., the solvent and dissolved species, with
M+ ions, and would vanish if those interactions were to
vanish. That is also the case for the contribution eφ(w).
The separation imposed by Eq. 1 is clear on the basis of
our mechanical understanding of electrostatics. But from
a thermodynamical view it is a nonoperational separation
[17].

As a gauge of molecular structure and energetics of the
solution in the neighborhood of an M+ ion, µM+(w) is
worthy of interest. In contrast, φ(w) reﬂects distribution
of charge on the surface of the system, and is of less
intrinsic interest because it is not sensitive exclusively
to the local condition of an ion of interest. The goal is
to separate µM+ (w) from thermodynamic combinations
such as µM+ (w) + µX−(w), to which the potentials of the
phases don’t contribute, and to separate µM+ (w) from
eφ(w).

Our notation here is deﬁcient in one respect. For equi-
librium of two conducting phases containing ionic solutes
at low concentration, the potential diﬀerence ∆φ = φ(γ)
- φ(η) across the phase boundary is not simply a prop-
erty of the pair of solvents in contact with one another
[8, 18].
(Note that many materials can be considered
conductors for suﬃciently long times.) From a formal
point of view of macroscopic thermodynamics, this fol-
lows from the requirement that the bulk compositions of
a macroscopic conductor be electrically neutral. More
physically, the ions make a Donnan-like contribution to
the diﬀerence between the electrostatic potentials of the
phases to achieve neutral bulk compositions. This poten-
tial diﬀerence does not progressively vanish as the con-
centration of the ionic solutes decreases, so it is not op-
erationally avoidable by conﬁning attention to low elec-
trolyte concentrations. The diﬀerence ∆φ, whatever its
source, does not contribute to the thermodynamic combi-
nations µM+(w) + µX− (w). Therefore an accurate evalu-
ation of µM+ (w) on any basis would avoid consideration
of ∆φ altogether.

Thermodynamic considerations will involve diﬀerences
in these free energies and diﬀerences ∆φ in the electro-
static potentials. If a dilute gas is considered to be the
coexisting conducting phase, it is instinctive to assign the
potential of that phase to be zero. No other considera-
tions need be aﬀected by this choice. It is then convenient
to take φ(w), for example, to be the potential relative to
a dilute gas phase.

III. ANALYSES BASED UPON ION-WATER
CLUSTER DATA

Discussions of the diﬃculty of obtaining the absolute
hydration free energy µM+ (w) often begin with the ob-
servation that thermodynamic processes for bulk phases
involve manipulation of neutral combinations of material.
It is natural, therefore, to consider adding a single ion to
a sub-macroscopic amount of solvent, for example

M+ + (H2O)n →

M (H2O)n

+

(2)

for n not too large. This leads to the consideration of
ion-water cluster experiments as a potential source of in-
formation on µM+ (w). Coe [19] helpfully reviews that
work. These experimental methods permit determina-
tion of a standard contribution to the chemical potential
of the cluster on the right side of Eq. 2 in a dilute gas, for
cluster sizes typically including n=4, 5, 6. It is helpful
to keep in mind that these quantities can be targets of
molecular simulation [20, 21] as well.

We collect several relevant points about these quan-
tities. A ﬁrst point is that the standard chemical po-
tential of such a cluster includes contributions from the
kinetic motion of the ion over the interior of the clus-
ter. For mesoscopic clusters, this contribution may be
awkward because the volume of the cluster accessible
to the ion can be ambiguous. An extreme example of
this ambiguity is the phenomenon, now well appreciated
[22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33], that some
ions might be localized on the surfaces of small water
clusters. Fortunately, the cluster sizes studied in ion-
water cluster experiments considered here are so small
that even the surface vs.
interior question doesn’t ap-
pear to be a signiﬁcant problem.

≡

A second basic point is that neither the experiment
nor the typical simulation calculations further separate
∆µM+ (w)
eφ + µM+ (w) into an absolute hydration
free energy and a contribution from the potential of the
phase. This is natural because both of these contribu-
tions derive from intermolecular interactions, and in the
case of simulations it would take a special separate calcu-
lation to evaluate the potential of the phase separately.
Our ﬁnal basic point about the separation Eq. 1 is
that the diﬃculties in separating the various contribu-
tions to the interaction contribution to the chemical po-
tential Eq. 1 from physical data are not trivially simpler
for a particular n. Though the contribution eφ is ex-
pected to depend on n, it will typically vanish neither for
small nor for large values of n.

Returning to the experimental analysis, we note that
the conventional hydration free energies of ions are ref-
erenced to the case for H+(aq). So the conventional hy-
dration free energy for the M+ ion is µM+ (w)
µH+ (w)
and similarly that for X− is µX−(w)+ µH+ (w). Following
Klots [34], we then form the following combination and
obtain:

−

∆µM+ (w)

−

∆µX+ (w) = 2(eφ(w) + µH+ (w))
µH+ (w))
+ (µM+ (w)

−

(µX− (w) + µH+ (w)) . (3)

−

The last two contributions in parenthesis on the right
are conventional single ion hydration free energies and
can be obtained from tables. Klots gives a plausible
procedure for obtaining the quantities on the left from

on the left of Eq. 3 were obtainable to suﬃcient accu-
racy from cluster studies (Eq. 2), then Eq. 3 could be
solved for eφ(w) + µH+ (w) = ∆µH+ (w), corresponding

3

to the same standard state as for H+ in compiling the
conventional ion hydration free energies. The evidence
presented [19, 34] suggests that this procedure is suc-
cessful to an interesting degree, and remarkably so for
small values of n. In view of those results and the analy-
sis from Eq. 3, we conclude that the values otained have
not separated the absolute hydration free energy µM+ (w)
from the potential of the phase in ∆µH+ (w).

In concluding this section, we return to consider the
Donnan-like contribution to ∆φ that was noted above
[8, 18]. This electrostatic contribution has its source in
sorting of ions of diﬀerent charges within the ion corre-
lation length of an interface. Though the source of this
contribution is the ions distributed in interfacial regions,
this contribution typically achieves a non-zero value in
the limit of vanishing ionic contributions. This contri-
bution is present in the macroscopic description Eq. 1.
But because the ion-water cluster experiments consid-
ered here treat clusters with only one ion that Donnan-
like ionic eﬀect isn’t present in those experimental data.

IV. QUASI-CHEMICAL THEORY

In the quasi-chemical theory [35], the region around
the solute of interest is partitioned into inner and outer
shell domains. A variational check of this partition ex-
ists, if desired [13]. Here we treat the inner shell, where
chemical eﬀects are important, quantum mechanically.
The outer shell contributions have been assessed using
both a dielectric continuum model and classical molecu-
lar dynamics simulations.

The inner shell reactions pertinent to the hydration of

X±( = H+, Li+, Na+, HO−) are

Based on earlier work, the inner shell hydration num-
bers are n = (2, 4, 4, 3) for H+ [12], Li+ [1], Na+[13], and
HO−[14], respectively. The free energy change for these
reactions were calculated using the Gaussian suite of pro-
± clusters (and H2O) were
grams [36]. The X

hybrid density functional[37] and the 6-31+G(d,p) basis

and the zero point energies were computed at the same
level of theory. Single point energies were calculated us-
ing the 6-311+G(2d,p) basis set.

Dielectric continuum model: For estimating the
outer shell electrostatic contribution, the ChelpG method
[38] was used to obtain partial atomic charges. The non-
electrostatic contributions are expected to make negligi-
ble contributions to the hydration free energy and are not
considered further. Then with the radii set developed by
Stefanovich et al.[39], surface tessera were generated [40],
and the hydration free energies of the clusters were calcu-
lated using a dielectric continuum model [41]. With this
information and the binding free energies for the chem-
ical reactions, a primitive quasi-chemical approximation

to the excess chemical potential of X±(aq) in water is:

turbation theory [42]. Trial calculations using a purely
linear response approximation (2nd order in perturba-
tion theory) deviate modestly from the above approxi-
mation, and hence for greater realism we employed the
above form. For clarity the above expressions pertain to
an atomic ion, but are easily generalized to complex ions
with distributed charges.

Since the solute is largely buried within the ﬁrst shell
water molecules, there is no need for developing accurate
parameters for those. This is true for the cations. For
HO−, the hydroxyl hydrogen is largely free [14]. But the
charge on this hydrogen is small, being about half the
charge of the hydrogen atoms in the classical water mod-
els [14]. Based on these observations, the van der Waals
parameters for Li+ and Na+ were obtained from [43] and
[44], respectively. The H and O atoms in the cluster were
assigned the same van der Waals parameters as those in
classical water model, of which both TIP3P[45, 46] and
SPC/E[47] were used. The charge distribution on these
clusters were the ChelpG charges. The clusters were sim-
ulated in simulation cells of diﬀerent sizes to estimate ion
ﬁnite-size eﬀects, and included 32, 64, 216 and 306 water
molecules in addition to the cluster of interest.

The simulations were all performed with the NAMD
[48] code which uses the particle mesh Ewald method to
treat long range electrostatic interactions. For each λ,
the simulation consisted of 200 ps of equilibration with
velocity scaling every 250 fs, followed by another 200 ps
of equilibration with velocity scaling every 1 fs. The wa-
ter geometry was constrained using SHAKE. The clus-
ter was held ﬁxed. For the 32 and 64 water molecule
boxes, a production run of 375 ps was conducted. For
the 216 and 306 water molecule boxes, the production
run lasted 150 ps. Frames were stored every 5 fs. Then
using programs developed in-house, the Ewald potential
at the solute charge sites were calculated, and statistical
uncertainties were estimated by block-averaging in block
sizes of 7.5 ps, corresponding roughly to the dielectric
relaxation of pure water [49]. Then the free energy was
assembled.

Electrostatic ﬁnite size corrections were applied as de-
scribed in Hummer et al. [21]. As in Hummer et al. [21],
the real-space screening factor was η = 5.6/L, where L

V. RESULTS

The hydration free energies obtained with the three dif-
ferent calcualtions of the outer-sphere contributions are
given in TABLE II. The agreement between our absolute
hydration free energies and Coe and coworkers’ [19, 50]
values is poor for the molecular dynamics results, and
fairs only somewhat better for the dielectric continuum
results. The computed hydration free energies for neutral
ion pairs, however, are in markedly improved agreement
with the experimentally suggested values table III, par-
ticularly for the molecular dynamics vales which are in
error by about 2-3 kcal/mole compared to the dielcetric
continuum predictions which err by 8-11 kcal/mole.

pKw of water: A further test of the pair hydration
free energy for H+ and HO− is to compute the pKw, a
quantity of immense interest in solution chemistry, espe-
cially protein biochemistry.

Earlier, Haymet and coworkers [51], Guissani and
coworkers [52] and Tawa and Pratt [53] considered the
ionization of water. Tawa and Pratt [53] went further,

calculated pKw’s are 21.1, 15.6 and 14.5, respectively,
for the outer-sphere contributions using dielectric contin-
uum, TIP3P water, and SPC/E water. The agreement
between the molecular dynamics results and the experi-
mental value of 15.7 [57] is excellent.

VI. DISCUSSION

From a molecular standpoint, the quantity of most in-
terest is µX, the absolute hydration free energy. This
absolute quantity is understood to be relative to the av-
erage potential of the phase, or equivalently to the value
of that potential of the phase being taken as zero.

In the Ewald summation method there is no interface,
and the mean potential in the cell is zero. Thus, use of
Ewald potential to compute charging free energies natu-
rally conforms to computation of the absolute hydration
free energy.

In a cluster, however, the reference potential is not
zero. Simulations of the vapor-water interface by Sokhan
and Tildesley[58] suggests that the potential
in bulk
SPC/E water is -12.7 kcal/mole-e relative to the vapor
value of 0 (zero). Adding this value to our SPC/E esti-
mate we obtain -256.7 kcal/mole for the hydration free
energy of the proton in the presence of the potential of
the phase. This greatly improves the agreement with
the value of the value of -265.9 kcal/mole obtained by
Coe and coworkers [19, 50, 59] and -264.3 kcal/mole ob-
tained by Klots [34]. Consistent with this but probably
more signiﬁcantly, the consensus results of TABLE II
suggest a value that is negative and somewhat greater
than 10 kcal/mole-e in magnitude.

A classic alternative to the ion-cluster experimental
studies for obtaining the absolute hydration free ener-
gies of ions is the tetraphenyl arsonium tetraphenyl bo-
rate (TATB) hypothesis [60]. The molecular intuition is
that these oppositely charged ions have the same non-
ionic interactions with any solvent molecules. If it were
precisely true that the absolute hydration free energy
of these two solutes were precisely the same, then the
Donnan-like eﬀects discussed above would imply ∆φ =
0 at equilibrium of this salt between two coexisting ﬂu-
ids. If true, this would be a satisfactory solution of the
present problem. But because the values obtained that
way would not include a contribution from the potential
of the phase, those values would be diﬀerent from val-
ues extracted from the ion-cluster studies analyzed here.
The computational testing of that TATB hypothesis has
lead to energetic uncertainties of nearly the same size as
the energetic contributions of issue here [60]. Therefore,
the TATB hypothesis must be currently viewed as not
satisfactorily proven. One important consideration is the
following: because of the particular electrical asymme-
try of water molecules, positively and negatively charged
ions with exactly the same non-ionic interactions with
water molecules will not have the same absolute hydra-
tion free energies. It is commonly observed in simulation

6

that anions are better hydrated than cations of the same
non-ionic interactions [9, 61, 62]; an intuitive view of that
phenomenon is that water molecule hydrogen atoms, car-
rying some positive charge, are able to approach anionic
solutes closely and this is diﬀerent for the corresponding
cationic solutes.

Our computed hydration free energy estimates, espe-
cially for ion pairs, is in good agreement with experi-
ments. This agreement should not obscure the approxi-
mations made in applying a rigorous theory to practical
calculations. These calculations might be improved in
several respects. For example, in calculating the excess
free energy of the cluster and the water ligand, we ne-
glected packing eﬀects and dispersion interactions. The
tacit assumption in the analysis is that in composing Kn
(eq. 4), errors in the cluster and the n water ligands bal-
ance out. For ionic species this appears to be a good
assumption, but it does fail for hydration of non-polar
solutes [63]. We foresee reﬁning these aspects of the cal-
culation in future studies.

The neglect of packing contributions is probably more
easily remedied; see the discussion [2]. Packing contribu-
tions are expected to be only a few percent of the chem-
ical and electrostatic eﬀects included already. But those
packing contributions are expected to be positive. Those
contributions would probably improve the agreement for
LiOH and NaOH in TABLE III. On the otherhand, sev-
eral additional eﬀects of comparable size would have to
be included at the same time. For example, the eﬀects of
anharmonicity on the thermal motion of the clusters is a
comparable worry.

VII. CONCLUSIONS

µH+ (w),
251 to

We ﬁnd that the absolute hydration free energy,
is somewhat smaller than the acknowledged
264 kcal/mole span of numbers. The present
−
analysis suggests that the more negative of these values
include the potential of the phase, a contribution distinct
from the absolute hydration free energy.

Calculations on ion-water clusters can be compared
properly with experiments on ion-water clusters. Those
results and comparisons can test the adequacy of such
calculations. But they don’t exclusively test the descrip-
tion of hydration of the ion; part of those results derives
from the surface structure of the cluster and that contri-
bution does not vanish for large clusters.

This study reinforces the idea that strenuous calcula-
tion of the absolute hydration free energy, µM+(w), for
a favorable case such as M=Li could probably reduce
the computational errors to less than the present exper-
imental uncertainties. This would permit a more precise
alignment of available tables of single ion absolute hydra-
tion free energies.

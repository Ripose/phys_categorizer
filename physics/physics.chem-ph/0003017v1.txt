Abstract

The similarity in the thermodynamic properties of two completely diﬀerent
theoretical models for the helix-coil transition is examined critically. The ﬁrst
model is an all-atomic representation for a poly-alanine chain, while the second
model is a minimal helix-forming model that contains no system speciﬁcs. Key
characteristics of the helix-coil transition, in particular, the eﬀective critical
exponents of these two models agree with each other, within a ﬁnite-size
scaling analysis.

The importance of understanding the statistical physics of the protein-folding

problem has been stressed recently [1, 2]. For instance, it is now often assumed that

the energy landscape of a protein resembles a partially rough funnel. Folding occurs

by a multi-pathway kinetics and the particulars of the folding funnel determine the

transitions between the diﬀerent thermodynamic states [1, 3]. This “new view” [1]

of folding was derived from studies of minimal protein models which capture only a

few, but probably dominant parameters (chain connectivity, excluded volume, etc.)

in real proteins.

An implicit yet fundamentally crucial assumption is that the basic mechanism of

structural transitions in biological molecules depends solely on gross features of the

energy function, not on their details, and that a law of corresponding states can be

used to explain dynamics and structural properties of real proteins from studies of

related minimal models. This assumption needs to be proven. An even stronger no-

tion in statistical physics is the universality hypothesis for critical phenomena. The

1

critical exponents are identical for diﬀerent theoretical models and realistic systems

belonging to the same universality class. Many theoretical concepts in protein fold-

ing, such as coil-helix or coil-globular transitions involve phase transition or phase

transition-like behavior. Thus, one wonders if physical measurements between two

model systems for the same transition would have any “universal” properties.

The purpose of this article is to examine these questions for the helix-coil tran-

sition in homopolymers of amino acids [4, 5]. Traditionaly, the coil-helix transition

is described by theories such as the Zimm-Bragg model [6] in which the homopoly-

mers are regarded as one dimensional systems with only local interactions; as such

a true thermodynamic phase transition is impossible. However, recently there have

been [4, 5] indications that the coil-helix transition near the transition temperature

displays phase-transition like behavior. We use here ﬁnite-size scaling analysis, a

common tool in statistical physics, to examine the question of universality of the

helix-coil transition in two completely diﬀerent, illuminating models. On one hand,

we have a detailed, all-atomic representation of a homo poly-alanine chain [7]. On

the other hand, we have a simple coarse-grained model describing the general fea-

tures of helix-forming polymers [4]. In this article, our interest lies in ﬁnding out how

far the similarity of the two models go. If the two models yield the same key physi-

cal characteristics, then we at least have one concrete example of the validity of the

corresponding state principle or universality hypothesis in biopolymer structures.

Poly-alanine is well-known to have high helix-propensities in proteins, as demon-

strated both experimentally and theoretically [5, 7]. It has been well tested and gen-

erally believed that approximate force ﬁelds, such as ECEPP/2[9] as implemented

in the KONF90 program [10], give protein-structure predictions to a surprisingly de-

gree of faithfulness. As our ﬁrst model, we have “synthesized” poly-alanine with N

residues, in which the peptide-bond dihedral angles were ﬁxed at the value 180◦ for

simplicity. Since one can avoid the complications of electrostatic and hydrogen-bond

interactions of side chains with the solvent for alanine (a non-polar amino acid), we

2

follow earlier work [7] and neglect explicit solvent molecules in the current study.

Our second model is a minimalistic view of a helix forming polymer [4] with-

out atomic-level speciﬁcs. A wormlike chain is used to model the backbone of the

molecule, while a general directionalized interaction, in terms of a simple square

well form, is used to capture the essence of hydrogen like bonding. The interaction

energy between the residue labeled i and j is modeled by,

Vij(r) = 


∞ r < D
−v D ≤ r < σ
0

σ ≤ r

(1)

where v = ǫ[ˆui · ˆrij]6 + ǫ[ˆuj · ˆrij]6, ˆui = (ˆri+1,i) × (ˆri,i−1), ˆrij is the unit vector between
monomer i and j, D = 3/2a is the diameter of a monomer, σ = q45/8a is the
bonding diameter, and a is the bond length while bond angle is ﬁxed at 60◦.

To obtain the thermodynamic properties, we have conducted multicanonical

Monte Carlo simulations for both models.

In the low-temperature region where

most of the structural changes occur, a typical thermal energy of the order kBT is

much less than a typical energy barrier that the polymer has to overcome. Hence,

simple canonical Monte Carlo or molecular dynamics simulations cannot sample

statistically independent conﬁgurations separated by energy barriers within a ﬁnite

amount of available CPU time, and usually give rise to bias statistics. One way

to overcome this problem is the application of generalized ensemble techniques [11],

such as the multicanonical algorithm [12] used here, to the protein folding problem,

as has recently been utilized and reported[13].

In a multicanonical algorithm [12] conformations with energy E are assigned a

weight wmu(E) ∝ 1/n(E), n(E) being the density of states. A simulation with this

weight generates a random walk in the energy space; since a large range of energies

are sampled, one can use the re-weighting techniques [14] to calculate thermody-

namic quantities over a wide range of temperatures by

hAiT =

Z dx A(x) w−1

mu(E(x)) e−βE(x)

Z dx w−1

mu(E(x)) e−βE(x)

,

(2)

3

where x stands for conﬁgurations and β is the inverse temperature.

In the case of poly-alanine chains, up to N = 30 alanine residues were consid-

ered. The multicanonical weight factors were determined by the iterative procedure

described in Refs. [12] and we needed between 4 × 105 sweeps (for N = 10) and

5 × 105 sweeps (for N = 30) for estimating the weight factor approximately. All

thermodynamic quantities were measured from a subsequent production run of M

Monte Carlo sweeps, where M=4 × 105, 5 × 105, 1 × 106, and 3 × 106 sweeps for

N = 10, 15,20, and 30, respectively. In the minimal model, chain lengths up to 39

monomers were considered. In this model a single sweep involves a rotation of a

group of monomers via the pivot algorithm[15]. For the weight factors the similar

number of iterative procedure was used, and for the production run 1 × 108 sweeps

was used in all cases.

We obtain the temperature dependence of the speciﬁc heat, C(T ), by calculating

C(T ) = β2 hE2

toti − hEtoti2

N

,

(3)

where Etot is the total energy of the system. We also analyze the order parameter q

which measures the helical content of a polymer conformation and the susceptibility

χ(T ) =

1

N − 2

(hq2i − hqi2) .

associated with q. For poly-alanine q is deﬁned as

q = ˜nH

(4)

(5)

where ˜nH is the number of residues (other than the terminal ones) for which the

dihedral angles (φ, ψ) fall in the range (−70 ± 20◦, −37 ± 20◦). For our worm-like

chain model the order parameter q is deﬁned as

q =

N −1

Xi=2

ui · ui+1

(6)

In both cases the ﬁrst and last residues, which can move more freely, are not counted

in the procedure.

From a ﬁnite-size scaling analysis of the heights and width of speciﬁc heat and

susceptibility we can extract a set of eﬀective critical exponents which characterize

the helix-coil transition in these two models [16]. For instance, with CMAX deﬁned

to be the maximum peak in the speciﬁc heat, we have

CMAX ∝ N

α
dν .

In a similar way, we ﬁnd for the scaling of the maximum of the susceptibility

χMAX ∝ N

γ
dν .

(7)

(8)

For both quantities we can also deﬁne the temperature gap Γ = T2 − T1 (where T1 <

TMAX < T2) chosen such that C(T1) = bCMAX = C(T2), and χ(T1) = bχ(Tc) = χ(T2)

where b is a fraction. The temperature gap obeys

Γ = T2 − T1 ∝ N

−

1
dν ,

(9)

as has been suggested in Ref. [16] . The analysis should be insensitive to the actual

fraction, b, of CMAX (χMAX) considered for deﬁning T1 and T2 which was veriﬁed

from our numerical data ﬁtting of poly-alanine chains.

The scaling exponents, α, ν, and γ, have their usual meaning in critical phe-

nomena; however, the above scaling relations also hold formally for the case of a

ﬁrst-order transition, with eﬀective scaling exponents dν = α = γ = 1 [16, 17]. Note

that d is the dimensionality of the system, and it always appears in the combination

dν. Without knowing further the eﬀective dimensionality of our systems, we use the

combination dν as a single parameter in the ﬁt.

It then becomes straightforward to use the above equation and the values given

in Table 1 to estimate the critical exponents. We obtain for poly-alanine from the

scaling of the width of the speciﬁc heat 1/dν = 1.02(11) with a goodness of ﬁt

(Q = 0.9) (see Ref. [18] for the deﬁnition of Q), for chains of length N = 15 to

N = 30. Inclusion of N = 10 leads to 1/dν = 0.84(7), but with a less acceptable

5

ﬁt (Q = 0.1). Similarly, we ﬁnd from the scaling of the width of the susceptibility

1/dν = 0.98(11) (Q = 0.5) for chains of length N = 15 to N = 30 and 1/dν = 0.81(7)

(Q = 0.2) when the shortest chain N = 10 is included in the ﬁt. Hence, we present

as our ﬁnal estimate for the correlation exponent of poly-alanine dν = 1.00(9).

This value is in good agreement with the estimate dν = 0.93(5) obtained from the

partition function zero analysis in Ref. [8].

The results for the exponent α give α = 0.89(12) (Q=0.9) when all chains are

considered, and α = 0.86(10) (Q = 0.9) when the shortest chain is excluded from the

ﬁt. Analyzing the peak in the susceptibility we ﬁnd γ = 1.06(14) (Q = 0.5) for chain

lengths N = 15 − 30 and γ = 1.04(11) (Q = 0.5) for chain lengths N = 10 − 30. We

summarize our ﬁnal estimates for the critical exponents in Table 2. The scaling plot

for the susceptibility is shown in Fig. 1: curves for all lengths of poly-alanine chains

collapse on each other indicating the validity of ﬁnite size scaling of our poly-alanine

data.

The same procedure can be applied to analyze the data from the minimal model.

All calculation has been done with the omission of the shortest chain. Using the

widths of the speciﬁc heat a b = 80% of the peak height we obtain 1/dν = 1.03(7),

(Q = 0.2). The width of the peak at half maximum is more unreliable in this case as

the coil-helix transition is complicated by the additional collapsing transition to a

globular state in the vicinity of the coil-helix transition[4]. This exponent agrees with

that calculated from the susceptibility widths, 1/dν = 0.89(9), (Q = 0.3). Hence,

our ﬁnal estimate for this critical exponent in our second model is dν = 0.96(8).

These values are in good agreement with those of the poly-alanine model.

From the CMAX data in Table 1 and using the above given value for the exponent

dν we ﬁnd α = 0.70(16) (Q = 0.3) which is somewhat smaller than that of the

poly-alanine model. The susceptibility exponent as calculated from the data in

Table 1 yields a value of γ = 1.3(2) (Q = 0.5), which agrees with the previous

estimation within the error bar. The scaling plot for the susceptibility is shown in

6

Fig. 2. While curves corresponding to large polymer sizes collapse into the same

curve, the N = 13 case shows small disagreement, indicating that the ﬁnite size

scaling are valid only for longer chain lengths in the minimal model.

Comparing the critical exponents of our two models as summarized in Table 2

we see that the estimates for the correlation exponent dν agrees well for the two

models. Within the error bars, the estimates for the susceptibility exponent γ also

agree. The estimates for the speciﬁc heat exponent α seem disagree within the

error ranges. However, in view of the fact that both analyses are based on small

system size the true error ranges could be actually larger than the ones quoted here.

Using these rather crude results, we have already demonstrated a striking similarity

in ﬁnite-size scalings of the two model. Therefore, we can convincingly make the

conjecture that minimal model can be used to represent the structural behavior of

real helix-forming proteins.

Our analysis should tell us also whether the helix-coil transition in our models is

of ﬁrst or second order. In the former case we would expect dν = α = γ = 1 which

seems barely supported by our data due to the rather large error bars associated

with the estimate of the exponents. We have further explored the nature of the

transition from another perspective, by considering the change in energy crossing a

small temperature gap (taken to be within 90% of CMAX) from the original data,

∆E = (Etot(T2) − Etot(T1))/N

(10)

This value should approach either a ﬁnite value or zero as N −1 goes to zero. A

ﬁnite value would indicate a ﬁrst order transition while a zero value a second order

transition. In the case of a ﬁrst order transitions the intercept would indicate the

latent heat. Now, the assumption is that this energy change scales linearly as N −1

goes to zero. Figure 3 shows a plot of the data from both the atomic-level and

minimal models, where nonzero intercepts can be extrapolated at N −1=0. Hence,

our results seem to indicate and ﬁnite latent heat and a ﬁrst-order like helix-coil

transition. However, we can not exclude the possibility that the true asymptotic

7

limit of |E| is zero, and some of the results of Ref. [5] point for the case of poly-alanine

rather towards a second-order transition. Further simulations of larger chains seem

to be necessary to determine the order of the helix-coil transition without further

doubts.

In summary, we conclude that in view of the similarity of the two models ex-

amined here, a corresponding state principle can be established for the coil-helix

transition. Examining the ﬁnite size scaling analysis allows us to calculate esti-

mators for critical exponents in the two models which indicate “universality” of

helix-coil transitions.

Longitudinal wavevector- and frequency-dependent

dielectric constant of the TIP4P water model

Abstract

A computer adapted theory for self-consistent calculations of the wavevector- and

frequency-dependent dielectric constant for interaction site models of polar systems

is proposed. A longitudinal component of the dielectric constant is evaluated for

the TIP4P water model in a very wide scale of wavenumbers and frequencies using

molecular dynamics simulations. It is shown that values for the dielectric permittiv-

ity, calculated within the exact interaction site description, diﬀer in a characteristic

way from those obtained by the point dipole approximation which is usually used in

computer experiment. It is also shown that the libration oscillations, existing in the

shape of longitudinal time-dependent polarization ﬂuctuations at small and inter-

mediate wavevector values, vanish however for bigger wavenumbers. A comparison

between the wavevector and frequency behaviour of the dielectric constant for the

TIP4P water and the Stockmayer model is made. The static screening of external

charges and damping of longitudinal electric excitations in water are considered as

well. A special investigation is devoted to the time dependence of dielectric quan-

tities in the free motion regime.

1 Introduction

The study of dielectric properties of polar liquids by computer experiment is still

a major challenge, given that the dielectric quantities are very sensitive to long-range

intermolecular interactions and because long trajectories are required in order to obtain

adequate statistical accuracy. For this reason, until now, the calculation of the wavevector-

and frequency-dependent dielectric permittivity, ε(k, ω), in the whole region of k and ω has

been performed for the simplest model of polar systems only, namely, for the Stockmayer

ﬂuid [1]. This model is related to a class of molecular models describing interactions

by point dipoles embedded in molecules. The Stockmayer system, however, does not

reproduce satisfactorily the dielectric behaviour of any real polar ﬂuid.

At the same time, more realistic interaction site (IS) models have also been consid-

ered [2–16]. In these atomic models, intermolecular potentials are presented as a sum of

pairwise additive site-site terms. Although IS models do not take into account internal

degrees of freedom such as electronic polarizability and, as a rule, intramolecular vibra-

tions, they are able to reproduce experimental results in a more satisfactory way. There

are two approaches to investigate the dielectric properties of IS models in both computer

experiment and theory.

In the ﬁrst, point dipole (PD) approach, the charged sites of

each molecule are replaced by a point dipole, located in the molecular centre of mass,

at constructing the reaction ﬁeld and the microscopic polarization vector. The site-site

contributions are taken into account implicitly only, namely, in the intermolecular poten-

tials, calculating statistical averages. In the second, IS description, the reaction and the

polarization vector are constructed in view of explicit details of charge distribution within

the molecule [16–18].

Main attention in early studies was directed to evaluate the static and frequency-

dependent dielectric constant, ε(ω), in the long-wavelength limit.

In particular, such

quantities have been calculated in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for the rigid

MCY [5] and TIP4P [6] models of water as well as for the ﬂexible SPC potential [7]. The

frequency dependence of the dielectric permittivity at nonzero wavevectors was investi-

gated for the MCY [2] and TIP4P [9, 10] water models, for models of methyl cyanide

[3, 4], methanol [11] and methanol-water mixtures [13]. But the investigations have been

restricted to small wavevector values for which the PD approach and the IS description

are expected to be identical. The wavevector dependence, ε(k), including high wavevector

2

values, was considered in the static limit for methanol [8], methanol-water mixtures [12]

and for the MCY water [14], using, however, the PD approximation. And only quite a

few simulations [15, 16] have been performed to deﬁne the entire wavevector dependence

within the exact IS description. To our knowledge, there are no computer experiment data

concerning the entire frequency dependence of the dielectric permittivity of IS models at

arbitrary wavenumbers.

It is necessary to point out also the following aspect of computer simulation of IS

models. The calculation of the dielectric constant by MD requires explicit considerations

of a ﬁnite-size medium with periodic boundaries. Usually either the cumbersome Ewald

summation technique [19] or the reaction ﬁeld [20] is applied for treating long ranged

interactions. As is now well established for systems of point dipoles, proper calculations

can be made with the both methods [21]. In the case of IS models the pattern is diﬀerent.

The usual point dipole reaction ﬁeld (PDRF) geometry, being exact for macroscopic

systems of point dipoles, may not be necessarily applicably to interpret simulation results

of IS models [22]. Recently [16], it has been shown by actual calculations that uncertainties

of the dielectric quantities are signiﬁcant if the standard PDRF geometry is used in

computer simulations. As a result, an alternative approach has been proposed. This

approach deals with the IS description at constructing the reaction ﬁeld and leads to the

so-called interaction site reaction ﬁeld (ISRF) geometry. It has been demonstrated that

the ISRF geometry exhibits to be much more eﬃcient with respect to the usual PDRF

for the investigation of dielectric properties of IS models. Within the ISRF geometry,

the longitudinal component, εL(k), of the wavevector-dependent dielectric constant for
the MCY water model has been evaluated in a wide wavenumber range by Monte Carlo

simulations [16]. Using correct microscopic variables for the polarization vector allows

one to achieve the true inﬁnite wavevector behaviour εL(k

) = 1.

→ ∞

In the present paper we propose a self-consistent theory for the calculation of the lon-

gitudinal wavevector- and frequency-dependent dielectric constant, εL(k, ω), for IS models
in computer experiment. This theory is applied to the TIP4P potential using MD simula-

tions. We show that the PD approach is valid for describing the frequency dependence of

the dielectric constant at very small wavenumbers only. For greater wavenumber values,

the inﬂuence of higher order multipoles becomes important. Within the IS description,

the longitudinal permittivity is evaluated in a rather very large scale of wavenumbers and

frequencies up to the inﬁnite wavevector and frequency limit, where εL(k, ω)

ciently large systems, the bulk (N, V

der to achieve this self-consistency in the evaluation of the bulk dielectric constant, the

equilibrium averaging in GL(k, t) must be performed for systems with the intermolec-
ular potential which leads exactly to the microscopic electric ﬁeld ˆE(r, t) (1) at which

the ﬂuctuation formula has been derived. This intermolecular potential can be deter-

The ﬂuctuation formula (4) has already been applied previously in the long-wavelength

work, it was not understood how to perform the truncation for intermolecular potentials.

is the diameter of the molecule.

In this case, the positions for sites and the centre of mass are undistinguished within

the same molecule. For IS ﬁnite samples, where d/R

= 0, the PDRF potential (7) may

aﬀect on a true macroscopic behaviour of the system considerably. At the same time,

the intermolecular potential ϕIS

corresponds completely to the conditions at which the

ﬂuctuation formula (4) has been obtained. Therefore, as far as this formula is applied to

treat simulation results, the ISRF potential (6), instead of (7), must be used in computer

experiment to reproduce a correct value for the dielectric constant.

Nevertheless, the molecular cut-oﬀ scheme can also be acceptable, but the PDRF

potential (7) as well as the ﬂuctuation formula (4) need to be modiﬁed.

In fact, the

As was mentioned earlier, internal electric ﬁelds of classical systems are pure longitu-
dinal. However, as it follows from the structure of equations (11), the ﬁeld ˆE(k, t) (10)

for ﬁnite systems may contain a transverse component as well which vanishes in the limit
of inﬁnite systems only. At the same time, in the ISRF geometry the ﬁeld ˆE(k, t)

R

→ ∞

(2) remains by a longitudinal one even for ﬁnite systems. Therefore, from a physical

point of view, the ISRF geometry is more natural than the MRF approach, because it

does not inﬂuence on the true structure of electric ﬁelds. Moreover, within the MRF

geometry, the ﬂuctuation formula (12) appears to be very complicated with respect to

the much more simple formula (4) in the ISRF approach. It requires the knowledge of

the additional correlation functions QL(k, t) and GL(k, q, t). While the function QL(k, t)
can be evaluated in the usual way, the function GL(k, q, t) at ﬁxed t, even for spatially

homogeneous systems, depends upon three parameters (magnitudes of k, q and the co-

sine between them) and its calculation is a hard problem and impractical in simulations.

Finally, the site-site cut-oﬀ truncation (6) has yet a minor advantage over the molecular

cut-oﬀ scheme (8) because the intermolecular potential of interaction ϕIS
ij

is continuous

and continuously diﬀerentiable. This avoids the system energy drift associated with the

passage of sites through the surface of the truncation sphere.

3 Application to the TIP4P potential

MD simulations have been carried out for the TIP4P potential [23] in the microcanon-

ical ensemble at a density of 1 g/cm3 and at a temperature of T = 293 K using the

ISRF geometry (6). We considered N = 256 molecules in the cubic volume V = L3 to

which the toroidal boundary conditions have been applied. The interaction cut-oﬀ radius
was half the cell length, R = L/2 = 9.856˚A. The simulations were started from a well

equilibrated conﬁguration for the positions of sites, obtained by Monte Carlo simulations.

Initial velocities of the molecules were generated at random with the Maxwell distribu-

tion. The equations of motion were integrated with a time step ∆t = 2 fs on the basis

of a matrix method using the Verlet algorithm in velocity form. The system was allowed

8

to achieve equilibrium for 100 000 time steps. The observation time over the equilibrium

state was 1 000 000 ∆t = 2 ns and each 10th time step has been considered to compute

the equilibrium averages. In order to provide the exact conservation for the total energy

of the system during such a rather very long observation time, the velocities of atoms were

slightly rescaled after every 500 time steps, so that the relative total energy ﬂuctuations

did not exceed 0.01% over the whole run. The time correlation functions were calcu-

lated with the time step ∆t in the interval of 1000∆t = 2 ps. The wavevector-dependent
quantities were investigated for k = [0, 1, . . . , 300]kmin, where kmin = 2π/L = 0.319˚A

dashed curve.

In order to verify explicitly that the ISRF geometry reproduces adequately the wave-

vector dependence of dielectric quantities, we have performed also additional simulations

for calculations of gL(k) using the generally recognized Ewald geometry and the PDRF
potential (7). These results are included in ﬁg. 1 as well (the open circles and dotted

curve). The parameters η = 5.76/L and kmax = 5kmin were used in the Ewald summation

of Coulomb forces. As we can see from the ﬁgure, the ISRF method leads to results

which are identical to those obtained within the cumbersome Ewald technique. At the

9

same time, deviations of values for the wavevector-dependent Kirkwood factor obtained

using the PDRF potential from those evaluated within the ISRF geometry are of order

20%. They are well exhibited at intermediate values of wavevectors. Such a situation can

be explained by the fact that the PDRF geometry does not take into account the spatial

distribution of charges within the molecule at constructing the reaction ﬁeld and, thus, the

precision of the calculations for wavevector-dependent dielectric quantities at k

better understood introducing the generalized coeﬃcient σL(k, ω) of polarization conduc-

dielectric permittivity do not lead to singularities in physically observing quantities. This

is so because these quantities are expressed through the external electric ﬁeld using multi-

optimal conditions (maximal average torques acting on molecules due to electric ﬁelds)

for alignment of dipoles along external ﬁelds are observed when spatial inhomogeneity of

these ﬁelds has a characteristic length of its varying in coordinate space of order of the

molecular diameter (the so called spatial resonance). A similar wavevector behaviour of

εL is exhibited for a central force model of water [15].

The knowledge of the dielectric constant in the whole region of wavenumbers allows

one to solve the problem of static screening of external charges in water. An external

charge, enclosed in the dielectric, causes a polarization of the system. The potential of

the electric ﬁeld, created in such a way, can be written in the k-representation as ϕ(k) =
ϕ(0)(k)/εL(k), where ϕ(0)(k) = 4π/k2 is the Fourier transform for the potential ϕ(0)(r) =
1/r of an unit charge in the vacuum. Then applying the inverse Fourier transform to the

εL(r).
The function 1/εL(r), which is plotted in ﬁg. 2b, describes the static screening. It can
be shown easily, using the asymptotic behaviour (A4), that the dielectric constant in the
inﬁnite wavenumber regime is expanded over inverse wavevectors as εL(k) = 1+1/(rDk)2+
(k−4), where rD = 1/kII. The expression εL(k) = 1 + 1/(rDk)2 is often used in the whole

The time correlation functions obtained in the IS description are identical to those

within the PD approximation in the zero wavevector limit only but they diﬀer from one

another signiﬁcantly at greater (k > kmin) wavevector values. For example, in the inﬁnite

wavevector limit (see ﬁg. 3g,h), the PD functions exhibit the pure Gaussian behaviour

fG(k, t), whereas the IS functions have a more complicated structure of the time depen-
dence (A3). Taking into account the remarks concerning the behaviour of these functions

in the static limit (see ﬁg. 1), we conclude that the PD approximation, being exact for

systems of point dipoles, is unsuitable, in general, to investigate the wavevector- and

frequency-dependent dielectric constant of IS models of polar ﬂuids.

The most striking feature in the time behaviour for the longitudinal component of the

inﬁnite-system function φL(k, t) is damped oscillations superimposed on the exponential.

been found previously for the MCY [2, 5] and TIP4P potentials [6] and for a model of

to zero and very small values (

Now, we are in a position to discuss the result of calculations (4) for the longitudinal

dependent dielectric constant for the TIP4P water has already been dealt with in the paper

[6]. In this paper, however, the dielectric relaxation was investigated at zero wavevector

value only. Moreover, the simulation results here were actually deduced within the PDRF

potential rather than the exact ISRF geometry. As has been concluded previously [16],

investigating the wavevector dependence of the dielectric constant of the MCY model,

and shown above for the wavevector-dependent Kirkwood factor gL(k) of the TIP4P
water (see ﬁg.1), it is risky to use the PDRF geometry for systems of hundreds molecules.

Although it is hard to tell except by numerical computations whether the results [6] for the

frequency dependence of the dielectric constant diﬀer signiﬁcantly from the exact results

corresponding to the macroscopic system. For this reason we have repeated the calculation

of the frequency-dependent dielectric constant ε(ω) = limk→0 εL(k, ω). The result of these
calculations, performed in the ISRF geometry, is shown in ﬁg. 6a. Comparing the previous

result (cf. ﬁg. 6 of ref. 6) with our one, we can observe that apart from the slight diﬀerences

in the low frequency regime the agreement is quite good for higher frequencies. Therefore,

the dielectric constant is less sensitive to boundary eﬀects at intermediate and high values

of frequency.

Since all the correlation functions decay exponentially at great times, in the low fre-

quency regime the dielectric permittivity behaves like the Debye dielectric for arbitrary

14

wavevectors. Deviations can be visible at higher frequencies and at small and interme-

diate wavevector values, where the collective molecular librations take an important role

in forming the polarization ﬂuctuations. Above some ω=1-10 THz, where THz=ps−1,

the relaxation process gradually changes into a resonance process characterized by an fre-

quency of 60-200 THz (which depends on wavevector) and reﬂecting the rapid librational

motion of the molecules. The main diﬀerences at zero wavevector between the frequency-

dependent dielectric constant for the TIP4P water, Debye and Stockmayer models as

well as real water have been done already [6, 26]. Now we consider diﬀerences in the

behaviour on frequency between the longitudinal dielectric constant of the TIP4P water

and the Stockmayer model [1] at nonzero wavevector values.

Despite a similar overall shape of εL(k, ω) to that of the Stockmayer ﬂuid, additional
features emerge for the TIP4P water, namely, a second maximum in the imaginary part

(k, ω) at k < 7kmin and a more complicated structure for the real part ε′
L

(k, ω) at

ε′′
L
k < 20kmin. For example, the real part ε′
L

(k, ω) for the Stockmayer system always increases

at increasing frequency, while we can observe clearly additional maximum and minimum

for the TIP4P water in the librational resonance range. Although the TIP4P model does

not reproduce the dielectric properties of water at all well, since it does not account for

polarizability and the coupling of inter- and intramolecular motions, a similar structure

in the dielectric constant of real water for nonzero wavevector values may be present

as well, because in real water the librational frequency is well separated from the lowest

intramolecular vibration [27]. It is interesting also to point out that the dielectric constant

of the TIP4P water at frequencies ω > 10 THz practically does not depend on wavevector

in the range 0

2kmin and even up to k = 10kmin at ω > 200 THz and remains

k

the same as in the low wavevector limit (cf. ﬁg. 6b-e). The wavevector- and frequency-

dependent dielectric constant at great wavenumber values is shown in ﬁg. 7. As we can

see, the correct value of nonpolarizable systems in the inﬁnite wavevector and frequency

limit, ε∞ = 1, can only be obtained if the dielectric constant is known up to about

the frequency dependence of the dielectric constant can be reproduced quantitatively

system. The dielectric constant, calculated in such a way, is shown in ﬁg. 6f-h and ﬁg. 7

Finally, we consider some aspects of applying the well-known Kramers-Kronig relations

to the longitudinal wavevector- and frequency-dependent dielectric constant. In general,

these relations connect real ξ′(ω) and imaginary ξ′′(ω) parts of the function ξ(ω) = ξ′(ω)

From the mathematical point of view the relations (15) are fulﬁlled if the function ξ(ω)

Then, taking into account the ﬂuctuation formulas (4), it can be shown that in two cases

4 Conclusion

A ﬂuctuation formula suitable for the self-consistent calculations of the wavevector-

and frequency-dependent dielectric constant for interaction site models of polar systems

has been rigorously derived in the situation that is typical for computer simulations. Using

this formula, the longitudinal component of the dielectric constant has been evaluated by

the MD method for the TIP4P model of water in a very wide scale of wavenumbers and

frequencies. The most striking feature of interaction site models consists in existing of the

libration oscillations in the shape of longitudinal time-dependent polarization ﬂuctuations

and this feature is reproduced by the TIP4P potential as well. We have showed, however,

that the libration oscillations vanish at increasing wavenumber. Choosing the correct

microscopic variable for polarization density, which corresponds completely to interaction

site models, allows us to investigate the frequency dependence of the dielectric constant

for arbitrary wavevector values. At the same time, it has been corroborated by the

explicit calculations that the PD approximation is unsuitable, in general, for evaluating

the wavevector- and frequency-dependent dielectric constant of interaction site models of

polar ﬂuids.

Since it has now been shown that the calculation of the wavevector- and frequency-

dependent dielectric constant in computer simulations for a given interaction site model

is practical in principle, we believe that this fact will stimulate further research in both

theory and pure experiment. A next paper of this series will be devoted to a more

complicated case, namely, to the calculation of the transverse wavevector- and frequency-

dependent dielectric constant for the TIP4P water.

It is worth to remark that the formulas (A3), (A4) at suﬃciently large values of wavevector k

can be applied to interacting systems as well, because then both intermolecular terms in (A1)

and terms in (A3) caused by interactions (nonlinear in t) are small.

Fig. 1. The longitudinal wavevector-dependent Kirkwood factor of the TIP4P water. The

result obtained for the ﬁnite and inﬁnite systems within the IS description using the ISRF

geometry is plotted by dashed and solid curves, respectively. The corresponding result of the

point dipole approximation for the inﬁnite system is presented by open squares. The inﬁnite-

system Kirkwood factor, evaluated in the Ewald and PDRF geometries, is shown as open circles

and dotted curve, respectively. The long-short dashed curve corresponds to the Kirkwood factor

in the free motion regime (equation (A4)).

Fig. 2. The longitudinal wavevector-dependent dielectric constant (a) of the TIP4P water

within the IS description (circles connected by the solid curve) and the PD approximation (open

squares). Two vertical lines indicate the positions of singularities. The function, describing the

static screening of external charges in water, is shown in (b).

Fig. 3. The normalized, time autocorrelation functions of the longitudinal polarization

ﬂuctuations in the TIP4P water for the ﬁnite (circles) and inﬁnite (solid curves) systems in the IS

description as well as for the ﬁnite system in the PD approximation (dashed curves). The dotted

curves show the self parts of the IS functions. The correlation functions of a noninteracting

system, calculated using the exact relation (A2) and the short time approximation (A3), are

shown by the long-short dashed curves and open circles, respectively. We note that ﬁve of the

six dependencies are undistinguished in (h).

Fig. 4. The 3D plot of the wavevector- and time-dependent longitudinal polarization ﬂuc-

tuations in the IS description for the inﬁnite system.

Fig. 5. The wavevector-dependent relaxation (circles) and correlation (squares) times for

the longitudinal polarization ﬂuctuations of the ﬁnite system. The results for the inﬁnite systems

are shown by the corresponding solid curves.

Fig. 6. The longitudinal wavevector- and frequency-dependent dielectric constant of the

TIP4P water. The real and imaginary parts are shown as solid and dashed curves, respectively.

Note the logarithmic scale in (a). Open squares connected by the long dashed curve in (b)-(e)

reproduce the real part of the frequency-dependent dielectric constant at zero wavevector. The

results obtained in the free motion regime (equation (A3)) are plotted in (f )-(h) as full (real

part) and open (imaginary part) circles, respectively.

Fig. 7. The longitudinal wavevector- and frequency-dependent dielectric constant of the

TIP4P water at great wavenumber values. Other features as for ﬁg. 6.

Abstract

A series of calculations on the energetics of complexation of alkaline
metals with 1,10-phenanthroline are presented. It is an experimental
fact that the ordering of the free energy of transfer across the water -
1,2-dichloroethane interphase is governed by the charge / size ratio of
the diferent cations; the larger cations showing the lower free energy
of transfer. This ordering of the free energies of transfer is reverted
in the presence of 1,10-phenanthroline in the organic phase. We have
devised a thermodynamic cycle for the transfer process and by means
of ab-initio calculations have drawn the conclusion that in the presence

1

of phen the free energy of transfer is governed by the stability of the
PHEN/M +complex, which explains the observed tendency from a
theoretical point of view.

1 Introduction

Cation transfer across liquid/liquid interphases assisted by complexing agents
has been the subject of intensive research in the last years [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
One main reason is the application of this phenomenon in cation extraction
processes [6, 7, 8] and in the development of new ion selective electrodes. In
this sense, alkaline and alkaline-earth cations transfer is mainly relevant in
the ﬁeld of clinical chemistry. Many natural and synthetic ligands have been
reported [9, 10] and are continuously appearing in an attempt to improve
selectivity, increase stability constants of the complex and solubility of the
above mentioned ions in the organic phase. Among these compounds, 1,10-
phenanthroline is a very well known ligand, especially for transition metals,
which are highly soluble in water and have very low selectivity. Alkaline and
alkaline-earth cations complexes with 1,10-phenanthroline are also known.
Cyclic voltammetry applied to four-electrode systems has been used [11] to
analyze the transfer mechanism, nature and stoichiometry of the complexes.
The experimental data indicates that in the case of Li+ the transfer would
occur according to the sequence:

M +(aq) ⇀↽ M +(org)

M +(org) + sP hen(org) ⇀↽ M(P hen)+

s (org)

where the indices “aq” and “org” indicate aqueous and organic phases re-
spectively and s denotes the stoichiometry of the metal-phenanthroline com-
plex. In the case where no 1,10-phenanthroline (Phen from now on) is added
to the organic phase, the potential of transfer and accordingly the free en-
ergy of transfer is lower for larger alkaline cations according to the smaller
charge/size ratio for these ions. In the presence of Phen in the organic phase
this order in the free energy of transfer is reverted indicating a strong inter-
action of the ions with smaller radii with Phen.

Synthesis and characterization of 1,10-phenanthroline derivatives have
been performed in the last years by diﬀerent groups [9, 10, 11], the main
aim of this research being the development of a Li+ selective electrode for

monitoring Li+ activity in biological systems. In this respect, calculation of
the interaction energy between ligand and cation would be helpful for the
prediction and design of new ionophores.

It is the purpose of the present work to provide a qualitative explanation
for some of the above mentioned experimental results concerning the trans-
fer of diﬀerent alkaline ions through the water/1,2-dichloroethane interphase
facilitated by 1,10-phenanthroline.

2 The Model

In order to explain the experimental results from a thermodynamic point of
view we devised a thermodynamic cycle for the overall transfer process as
shown in Figure 1. The global transfer process, here denoted with (1) is
divided into a number of elementary steps (2-5) for which we are going to
analyze the relative contributions to (1). In step (2) we take phenanthroline,
which is dissolved in the organic solvent to the gas phase. We shall denote
this contribution with -∆Gdis . In step (3) we take an alkaline ion, which is
dissolved in the aqueous phase to the vacuum. This step involves a free energy
change which is equal to minus the solvation free energy of the ion in water
−∆GM +
solv. In step (4) we combine the alkaline ion with phenanthroline in the
gas phase to yield a compound that we shall denote as P henM +.We label the
related free energy change with ∆GP henM +
. In step (5) we bring P henM +

f

3

into the organic phase, with an associated free energy change ∆GP henM +

.

solv

In order to consider relative diﬀerences between the transfer free energies
of the diﬀerent alkaline ions, we can leave aside the contribution of step (2)
(which amounts 68.9 KJ/mol) to the total free energy change, since it is
the same for all the ions. If the contribution −∆GM +
solv of step (3) were the
dominant one, the overall process would be favored for the bigger ions, as
most solvation models state, this desolvation energy is inversely proportional
to the radius of the ion. Turning to step (5), the resolvation of the complex
should involve only a minor contribution to the total free energy, since the
charge/size ratio of this species should be almost the same for all the ions.
Thus, step (4) must be responsible for the observed trend in the free energy of
transfer. In order to check out the validity of this conclusion, we performed
a series of ab-initio calculations of the structure of alkaline metal - 1,10-
phenanthroline cationic complexes. We analyzed the diﬀerences of energy of
the complexation process between the diﬀerent ions in terms of the nature
of the chemical bond that is formed.

3 Ab-initio calculations

The subject of the present study are the complexes of 1,10-phenanthroline
with lithium, sodium and potassium cations (Li+, Na+, K+). The ﬁrst step of
the study was to determine the structure of the diﬀerent complexes. Geome-
try optimizations were carried out for 1,10-phenanthroline, LiPhen+,NaPhen+
and KPhen+ using STO-3G [15][16][17] and MIDI [18] basis sets at the RHF
level, the energies of the single ions Li+, Na+and K+ were also calculated.
The results for these energy calculations are shown in Table 1. MP2 cor-
rections ∆Ec accounting for the correlation contribution to the total energy
were also calculated and added to the RHF/MIDI results, as given in the
third column of this table. These corrections include core orbitals and were
obtained using the geometries at the energy minimum of the RHF/MIDI
results. All calculations were performed at C2v symmetry.

Table 2 shows the results for the energy change associated with complex
formation ∆Ecf (P henM +) at the diﬀerent levels of theory as calculated from
the results from Table 1. In all cases we ﬁnd the stability of the P henM +
complex to increase in the order: P henK + < P henNa+ < P henLi+, in
agreement with the expectations formulated in the previous section.

Taking into account that the basis sets that were used for the calculation

4

are small, we must consider that the basis set superposition error (BSSE)
associated with the RHF calculation could deliver an important contribution
to the energy change of complex formation. The energy diﬀerences related
to ∆EBSSE, deﬁned below, are shown in Table 3 for the RHF calculations
with STO-3G and MIDI basis sets, as calculated according to the method of
Boys and Bernardi [19]. Within this method, the corrected energy of complex
formation ∆EBSSE−corr

is calculated from:

cf

∆EBSSE−corr

cf

= Ecf (P henM +) − EM +−gh

P hen − EP hen−gh

M +

where EP henM + is the calculated energy for the complex, EM +−gh
denotes
the energy of Phen when the calculations are performed including the basis
functions of M+ as a ”ghost” molecule and EP hen−gh
is the energy of M+
with the Phen molecule as a ghost. The BSSE is calculated as follows:

P hen

M +

∆EBSSE = ∆EBSSE−corr

cf

− ∆Euncorr
cf

Since the BSSE error arises from the mathematical fact that the basis sets
are not complete, the inclusion of the ghost molecules always produces a low-
ering of the energy. ∆EBSSE is then a positive quantity which will be lower
the larger the basis set used for the calculation. Thus, ∆Euncorr
includes
some energy that is not related to the chemical reaction itself but with the
better description of the wave function of one monomer augmented by the in-
clusion of the basis set of the other. We ﬁnd that in the present case ∆EBSSE
amounts less than 39% and 12% of the binding energy ∆Ecf (P henM +) for
the RHF/STO-3G and RHF/MIDI cases respectively.

cf

Another factor to include in the binding energies of P henM + are the
corrections for the change in zero point energy (ZPE) between Phen and
PhenM+. These ZPE values were obtained from a normal mode analysis at
the equilibrium geometry at RHF/STO-3G and RHF/MIDI levels of theory,
further details about vibrational analysis are given below in section 3. The
values for the ZPE correction are given in Table 4. Since upon complex
formation new weak bonds are formed, the change in ZPE is always positive
and small compared to the total ∆Ecf (P henM +), amounting less than 1.7 %
and 2.4% of the binding energy for the RHF/STO-3G and RHF/MIDI cases
respectively.

In Table 5 we show the results for the energy change of complex formation

for the diﬀerent complexes with all corrections included.

Using the theoretical values for the vibrational frequencies, optimized ge-
ometries and energy changes calculated ab-initio, we made estimations for
the changes in the thermodynamic functions for alkaline metal cation com-

the results for the changes in internal energy, enthalpy, entropy and free en-
ergy calculated using normal mode harmonic oscillator, rigid rotor and ideal
gas partition functions for the diﬀerent complexes, metals and Phen. We
ﬁnd that the entropy change is small, arising fundamentally from the loss
in translational degrees of freedom upon complexation. Thus, the free en-
ergy change of this reaction is energetically dominated at normal laboratory
temperatures.

In spite of the fact that the approximations used here make these values
only a rough estimation of the real ones, we can clearly see a trend in stability
of the diﬀerent complexes in the order Li > Na > K. According to the thermo-
dynamic cycle shown in section 1, this would indicate that the free energies of
transfer and accordingly the transfer potential for the diﬀerent ions across the
water 1,2-dichloroethane interphase assisted by 1,10-phenanthroline should
follow the sequence:

∆VK > ∆VN a > ∆VLi

which is in fact, as we have previously stated, the order found in the voltam-
metric experiment.

4 Structure and vibrational spectra of the

complexes

Figure 2 shows the structure of Phen and Li+, Na+ and K+ complexes as
obtained from RHF/MIDI geometry optimizations. The structure of 1,10-
phenanthroline is in very good agreement with reported experimental results
based on single crystal X-ray diﬀraction [20]. The structures of complexes
PhenLi+ and PhenNa+ obtained from the calculations show shorter N-M+
bond lengths than those obtained from X-ray diﬀraction experiments [21,
22, 23], this is reasonable since in the crystal there is always a counterion
coordinated with the metal cation. Comparison of Phen deformation upon
complexation is diﬃcult because in the crystals the Phen molecule is strongly
distorted from C2v symmetry and it is not easy to determine which geometry
changes are produced by complexation and which by crystal packing.

As we may see at a ﬁrst glance the major structural diﬀerence between
the diﬀerent complexes is the Phen-cation distance, which increases in going
from Li+ to K+ as shown in Table 7, where we report the N-M+ distances
dN −M + for the diﬀerent complexes. It is found that dN −M + is smaller for Li+
and almost the same for Na+ and K+ complexes.

Figure 3 shows the perturbation of Phen structure produced by the com-
plexation with the diﬀerent cations. The arrows indicate the direction and
relative magnitude of the diﬀerence in position between corresponding atoms

subject to the constraint of keeping constant the structure of both molecules.
According to this ﬁgure we may think of the Phen molecule as a pair
of forceps that closes around the ion. The presence of Li+ between the
forceps originates a closing whereas the presence of Na+ or K+ originates an
opening of the forceps. This observation and the other stated in the previous
paragraph may be brieﬂy stated in the following words: complexation occurs
when the metal accommodates itself in the ”cavity ” formed by the two
nitrogen atoms in Phen. Since Li+ is the smallest, it ﬁts comfortably in
this cavity and results in its contraction. On the other hand, Na+ and K+
are bigger than the size of the cavity, forcing Phen to open for a proper
accommodation of the incoming ion.

We turn now to the study of the diﬀerences in vibrational spectra between
the diﬀerent complexes involving alkaline ions and Phen. These vibrational
spectra were calculated using normal mode analysis at the equilibrium ge-
ometry at RHF/MIDI level using force constants calculated from ab-initio
analytical second order derivatives of the RHF/MIDI energy. No scaling was
done of vibrational frequencies since no predictive analysis is pretended but
only a qualitative description of the main changes observed. In ﬁgure 4 we

can see the simulated spectra. In order to clarify the main features we have
superimposed to the usual line representation a graph obtained by summing
gaussian functions centered at each frequency with the corresponding inten-
sity, all of the same amplitude in wavenumber. This construction does not
attempt to compare with experimental information but to make easier to
detect the main features of the spectra.

The fundamental diﬀerences between the spectra for the diﬀerent com-
plexes appear mainly in the low frequency bands. Two distinctive bands at
250 cm−1 and 600 cm−1 appear in the case of PhenLi+, corresponding to
Li out of plane bending and Li-Phen stretching respectively. Corresponding
bands of PhenNa+ and PhenK+ are displaced towards considerably lower
frequencies indicating the stronger bonding of Li+ to Phen with respect to
Na+ and K+ yielding higher force constants for Li+-Phen vibrations.

complex and the monomers at the equilibrium geometry of the complex:

∆ρ(x, z) = ρP henM +

(x, z) − ρP hen(x, z) − ρM +

(x, z)

It can be appreciated that the electron withdrawal by the metal ion pro-
duces an electron depletion located mainly in the neighborhood of the N
lone pair. The increase of positive charge on the N atoms sparks a redis-
tribution of the electronic density via inductive eﬀects across the bonding
network. Thus, a concomitant polarization of the C-H bonds occurs in all
the molecule. However, this has only a minor eﬀect on the C-H vibrational
frequencies and bond distances.

Mulliken analysis of the atomic charge on the diﬀerent cations is shown
in Table 8. The numbering scheme used here for the carbon atoms is shown
in Figure 6a. The electronic charge transfer from Phen to the ion seems to
be rather small, and almost the same for the three species considered here.
According to Mulliken analysis, the carbon atoms which show the largest
positive charge accumulation ∆q = qcomplex ed − qf ree are C2, C4 and C13
(and the symmetrical counterparts C9, C7 and C14). In the most relevant
case of Li, the sequence found is the sequence ∆qC2 > ∆qC13 > ∆qC4. The C2

12

atom is directly aﬀected by the electron withdrawal at the N atom, remaining
its only possibility of recovering electronic charge via inductive eﬀects from
C3. On the other hand, C13 accommodates its charge better since it can
take charge from two bonds instead of only one. The positive charge of C4 is
produced by electron withdrawal through the external and internal bonding
network via C11 and C3.

As thoroughly analyzed by Bader[24], the laplacian of the electronic den-
sity ∇2ρ can also deliver relevant information concerning the nature of the
chemical bond and chemical reactivity. It can be shown that if ∇2ρ < 0 at
the point r , then ρ(r) is greater than the average of its value over an in-
ﬁnitesimal sphere centered on r, while the opposite is true if ∇2ρ > 0. Thus,
the laplacian can be used as a criterion for charge concentration or depletion
in the diﬀerent molecular regions, and it deﬁnes in the interatomic regions
the so called valence-shell charge concentration. This corresponds to the por-
tion of the outer shells of the atoms over which ∇2ρ < 0, that is, the region
where the chemically relevant valence electronic charge is concentrated. The
contourplot of the laplacian of the electronic density ∇2ρ over σv(xz) for the
diﬀerent complexes and Phen are shown in Figure 7 for the region surround-
ing the N atoms. The analysis of the plots of the laplacian electronic density
for the diﬀerent complexes and Phen shows the bonded charge concentration
between the C-N and C-C bonds, as well the non-bonded charge concentra-
tion in the neighborhood of the N atoms. Comparison between the plots
obtained for a free and for a complexed Phen shows that this molecule is not
aﬀected by complex formation even in its ﬁner details and no evidence of
a new chemical bond between Phen and the diﬀerent cations can be found.
Furthermore no drastic diﬀerences are seen in the plots for the diﬀerent com-
plexes that cannot be ascribed to the diﬀerences in the relative radii of the
diﬀerent cations. Thus, all previously stated observations suggest that the
Phen - M+ bond is mainly of electrostatic nature and that the orders of sta-
bility of the diﬀerent complexes is produced by the diﬀerences in ionic radii
between the diﬀerent cations.

6 Conclusions

We have used a thermodynamic model to analyze the transfer potential of al-
kaline ions across water / 1,2-dichloroethane facilitated by 1,10-phenanthroline.
Based on ab-initio calculations we have concluded that this process is domi-

nated by the free energy of complex formation.

The diﬀerences in energy and structure of the diﬀerent complexes can be
explained by the diﬀerent radii of the cations since the Phen - M+ bond is
fundamentally of electrostatic (charge - dipole) nature.

According to Mulliken analysis, the carbon atoms that accommodate
most of the positive charge upon complex formation are C2, C13 and C4
(and their symmetrically equivalent positions). According to this, substitu-
tion in C2 and C4 with inductive electron donors R2 and R1 as shown in
Figure 6b would increase the selectivity of Phen towards Li+. R1 should
be voluminous so as to prevent the accommodation of the larger cations by
steric hindrance increasing Li+ selectivity. The voluminous part of the sub-
stituent should not be located at the C atom vicinal to the ring but rather
in the second C atom so as to produce stronger disturbance for Na and K
which are located farther than Li in the equilibrium structures. Experimen-
tal evidence indicates that 2,9-dibutyl-1,10-phenanthroline shows excellent
selectivity coeﬃcients towards Li+ [13, 25]; substitution at positions 4 and 7
with phenyl rings increases this selectivity but not very strongly. This fact
supports our conclusions and leads us to state that it should be possible to
predict qualitative tendencies in selectivities of diﬀerent ligands performing
ab-initio and probably semiempirical quantum mechanical calculations on
the energetics of complexation. This must be done taking into account that,
at least for the singly charged cations, the complexation step of the cation
plays a dominant role in the energetics of transfer.
In the case of doubly
charged cations, the solvation energy increases considerably in magnitude (it
scales with the square of the charge) and may have a more important con-
tribution to the thermodynamics of the ion transfer. This may explain why
2,9-dibutyl-1,10-phenanthroline is selective towards Li+ even in the presence
of Mg2+.

Intramolecular vibrational energy redistribution as state space diﬀusion:
Classical-Quantum correspondence

(Dated: December 19, 2013)

We study the intramolecular vibrational energy redistribution (IVR) dynamics of an eﬀective
spectroscopic Hamiltonian describing the four coupled high frequency modes of CDBrClF. The IVR
dynamics ensuing from nearly isoenergetic zeroth-order states, an edge (overtone) and an interior
(combination) state, is studied from a state space diﬀusion perspective. A wavelet based time-
frequency analysis reveals an inhomogeneous phase space due to the trapping of classical trajectories.
Consequently the interior state has a smaller eﬀective IVR dimension as compared to the edge state.

Investigating the dynamics of an initially localized vi-
brational excitation of a molecule in terms of timescales,
ﬁnal destinations and competing pathways has been of
considerable interest to chemical physicists for a num-
ber of decades[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. Due to the sustained
theoretical[1, 2, 3, 7] and experimental eﬀorts[4, 5, 6, 7]
it is only now that a fairly detailed picture of the
intramolecular vibrational energy ﬂow is beginning to
emerge. Recent studies[8, 9, 10, 11] suggest that IVR can
be described as a diﬀusion in the zeroth-order quantum
number space (also known as the state space) mediated
by the anharmonic resonances coupling the zeroth-order
states. The state space approach[6] makes several predic-
tions on the observables associated with IVR. Foremost
among them is that an initial zeroth-order bright state
diﬀuses anisotropically on a manifold of dimension D

the full state space dimension and zero[12]. For further
discussions on the origin and approximations inherent to
eq. 2 we refer the reader to the original reference[12]. In
the context of the present study it is suﬃcient to note
Nloc which has been conﬁrmed in the earlier

work[12].

Clearly Eq. 2 explicitly includes the various anhar-
monic resonances and hence not only the local nature
but the directionality of the energy ﬂow is also taken
into account. The main point is that the above estimate
for D, which can be obtained without computing the ac-
tual dynamics, is crucially dependent on the nature of the
IVR diﬀusion in the state space. However, to the best of
our knowledge, precious little is known about the dynam-
ics associated with the state space diﬀusion. Our moti-
vation for investigating the IVR dynamics in the state
space has to do with the observation that the state space
model shares many of the important features found in the
classical-quantum correspondence studies of IVR[1, 2, 3].
Classical dynamical studies identify the nonlinear reso-
nance network as the crucial object. On such a network,
directionality and the local nature of IVR arises rather
naturally mainly due to the reason that molecular phase
spaces are mixed regular-chaotic even at fairly high ener-
gies. How does the mixed phase space inﬂuence the IVR
diﬀusion in the state space? Is there any relation, and
hence correlation, between the classical resonance net-
work and the IVR dimension D in the state space? Is it
possible that local dynamical traps in the classical phase
space can aﬀect the validity of Eq. 2? Answers to these
questions can have signiﬁcant impact on our ability to
control IVR and hence reaction dynamics. The issues in-
volved are subtle and this preliminary work attempts to
address the questions by studying a speciﬁc system.

Although detailed classical-quantum correspondence
studies of IVR have been performed[1, 2, 3, 13] on sys-
tems with two degrees of freedom, in order to address

the questions one needs to analyze atleast a three degree
of freedom case. This is due to the fact that the scal-
ing theory of Schoﬁeld and Wolynes posits D = 2 as the
critical scaling i.e., near the IVR threshold[8]. Thus for
systems with two degrees of freedom the separation of
diﬀusive and critical regimes is not very sharp[13]. How-
ever, studying IVR from the phase space perspective is
diﬃcult in systems with three or more degrees of free-
dom.
In this study we use a time-frequency technique
proposed by Arevalo and Wiggins[14] to construct a use-
ful phase space representation of the resonance network
for three degrees of freedom. Such an approach, as seen
below and in many recent studies[15, 16], is particularly
well suited for our purpose. Thus we choose an eﬀec-
tive spectroscopic Hamiltonian[17] describing the energy
ﬂow dynamics between the four high frequency modes
of CDBrClF. The Hamiltonian H = H0 + Vres with the
anharmonic zeroth-order part

The harmonic creation and destruction operators for the

that despite having four coupled modes the system has
eﬀectively three degrees of freedom due to the existence
of a conserved polyad N = vs + (vf + va + vb)/2.
In
this work we choose N = 5 for illustrating the main idea.
Similar results are seen in other systems and the details
will be published later. The values of the various param-
eters are taken from the ﬁt in reference[17] (fourth col-
umn, Table VIII). The Fermi resonance strengths ksjm
are larger then the mean energy level spacings (13.7 cm−1

ratio space is divided into cells and the number of times
that a cell is visited for all the trajectories gives the den-
sity plot. We further normalize the highest density to
one for convenience. Two points should be noted at this
stage. First, such a density plot is providing a glimpse
of the energy shell and is reﬂecting the full dynamics in-
cluding the important resonances. Thus we are mapping
out parts of the Arnol’d web i.e., the resonance network
that is actually utilized by the system. Secondly, we are
computing a slice of the energy shell and for strongly cou-
pled systems one expects the phase space structure to be
diﬀerent for diﬀerent slices i.e., nontrivial dependence on
the angles θ. We thus compute a highly averaged struc-
ture in the frequency ratio space which is nevertheless
still capable of providing important information on the
nature of the classical dynamics. The resulting density

absence of any trapping regions then one can associate a
dimensionality df r = 2 to the frequency space. However
Fig. 3 show that for both states df r < 2 and one might
therefore associate a fractal dimension between df r = 1
and df r = 2. Clearly df r(1) > df r(2) and hence one can

We conclude by making a few observations. Gambogi
et al. observed[25] a similar eﬀect in propyne wherein
the eigenstate-resolved spectra indicated that the combi-
nation mode v1 + 2v6 is much less perturbed by IVR as
compared to the nearly isoenergetic 3v1 overtone state.
It was argued that such eﬀects are to be expected in large
molecules. The present example shows that enhanced in-
stability of overtone states as compared to the combina-
tion states can occur in few mode systems as well. The
current study highlights this to be a dynamical eﬀect.
The decoupling of the (s, f ) modes from the (a, b) modes

for state
b
is dynamically decoupled into two sub-Hamiltonians: one
approximately conserving the polyad 2vs + vf and the
other conserving the polyad va + vb. The precise forms of
such sub-Hamiltonians is not clear as of now. Finally, the
extensive ab-lock and the resulting decoupling of the CD-
bend modes may relate to the observation made by Beil
et al. on a possible case of an approximate symmetry[17]
which arises from a near conservation of a formal a′ sym-
metry associated with the bending states. This point,
however, requires further studies.

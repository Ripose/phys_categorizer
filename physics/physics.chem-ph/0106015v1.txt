Abstract

It is shown that the recently observed ∆J = 2 staggering eﬀect (i.e. the relative dis-
placement of the levels with angular momenta J, J + 4, J + 8, . . . , relatively to the levels
with angular momenta J + 2, J + 6, J + 10, . . . ) seen in superdeformed nuclear bands is also
occurring in certain electronically excited rotational bands of diatomic molecules (YD, CrD,
CrH, CoH), in which it is attributed to interband interactions (bandcrossings). In addition,
the ∆J = 1 staggering eﬀect (i.e. the relative displacement of the levels with even angular
momentum J with respect to the levels of the same band with odd J) is studied in molecular
bands free from ∆J = 2 staggering (i.e. free from interband interactions/bandcrossings).
Bands of YD oﬀer evidence for the absence of any ∆J = 1 staggering eﬀect due to the
disparity of nuclear masses, while bands of sextet electronic states of CrD demonstrate that
∆J = 1 staggering is a sensitive probe of deviations from rotational behaviour, due in this
particular case to the spin–rotation and spin–spin interactions.

1 Introduction

Several staggering eﬀects are known in nuclear spectroscopy [1]:

1) In rotational γ bands of even nuclei the energy levels with odd angular momentum
I (I=3, 5, 7, 9, . . . ) are slightly displaced relatively to the levels with even I (I=2, 4, 6,
8, . . . ), i.e. the odd levels do not lie at the energies predicted by an E(I) = AI(I + 1) ﬁt
to the even levels, but all of them lie systematically above or all of them lie systematically
below the predicted energies [2].

2) In octupole bands of even nuclei the levels with odd I and negative parity (I π=1−,
3−, 5−, 7−, . . . ) are displaced relatively to the levels with even I and positive parity (I π=0+,
2+, 4+, 6+, . . . ) [3, 4, 5, 6].

3) In odd nuclei, rotational bands (with K = 1/2) separate into signature partners, i.e.
the levels with I=3/2, 7/2, 11/2, 15/2, . . . are displaced relatively to the levels with I=1/2,
5/2, 9/2, 13/2, . . . [7].

1

In all of the above mentioned cases each level with angular momentum I is displaced
relatively to its neighbours with angular momentum I ± 1. The eﬀect is then called ∆I = 1
staggering.
In all cases the eﬀect has been seen in several nuclei and its magnitude is
clearly larger than the experimental errors. In cases 1) and 3) the relative displacement
of the neighbours increases in general as a function of the angular momentum I [2, 7],
while in case 2) (octupole bands), the relevant models [8, 9, 10, 11, 12] predict constant
displacement of the odd levels with respect to the even levels as a function of I, i.e. all the
odd levels are raised (or lowered) by the same amount of energy.

A new kind of staggering (∆I = 2 staggering) has been recently observed [13, 14] in
superdeformed nuclear bands [15, 16, 17]. In the case in which ∆I = 2 staggering is present,
the levels with I=2, 6, 10, 14, . . . , for example, are displaced relatively to the levels with
I=0, 4, 8, 12, . . . , i.e. the level with angular momentum I is displaced relatively to its
neighbours with angular momentum I ± 2.

Although ∆I = 1 staggering of the types mentioned above has been observed in several
nuclei and certainly is an eﬀect larger than the relevant experimental uncertainties, ∆I = 2
staggering has been seen in only a few cases [13, 14, 18, 19] and, in addition, the eﬀect is
not clearly larger than the relevant experimental errors.

There have been by now several theoretical works related to the possible physical origin
of the ∆I = 2 staggering eﬀect [20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26], some of them [27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32]
using symmetry arguments which could be of applicability to other physical systems as well.
On the other hand, rotational spectra of diatomic molecules [33] are known to show great
similarities to nuclear rotational spectra, having in addition the advantage that observed
rotational bands in several diatomic molecules [34, 35, 36, 37] are much longer than the
usual rotational nuclear bands. We have been therefore motivated to make a search for
∆J = 1 and ∆J = 2 staggering in rotational bands of diatomic molecules, where by J
we denote the total angular momentum of the molecule, while I has been used above for
denoting the angular momentum of the nucleus. The questions to which we have hoped to
provide answers are:

1) Is there ∆J = 1 and/or ∆J = 2 staggering in rotational bands of diatomic molecules?
2) If there are staggering eﬀects, what are their possible physical origins?
In Sections 2 and 3 the ∆J = 2 staggering and ∆J = 1 staggering will be considered
respectively, while in Section 4 the ﬁnal conclusions and plans for further work will be
presented.

2 ∆J = 2 staggering

In this section the ∆J = 2 staggering will be considered. In subsection 2.1 the ∆I = 2
staggering in superdeformed nuclear bands will be brieﬂy reviewed. Evidence from existing
experimental data for ∆J = 2 staggering in rotational bands of diatomic molecules will
be presented in subsection 2.2 and discussed in subsection 2.3, while subsection 2.4 will
contain the relevant conclusions. We mention once more that by J we denote the total
angular momentum of the molecule, while by I the angular momentum of the nucleus is
denoted.

2.1 ∆I = 2 staggering in superdeformed nuclear bands

In nuclear physics the experimentally determined quantities are the γ-ray transition energies
between levels diﬀering by two units of angular momentum (∆I = 2). For these the symbol

E2,γ(I) = E(I + 2) − E(I)

is used, where E(I) denotes the energy of the level with angular momentum I. The deviation
of the γ-ray transition energies from the rigid rotator behavior can be measured by the
quantity [14]

∆E2,γ(I) =

(6E2,γ(I) − 4E2,γ(I − 2) − 4E2,γ(I + 2)

1
16
+ E2,γ(I − 4) + E2,γ(I + 4)).

Using the rigid rotator expression

E(I) = AI(I + 1),

one can easily see that in this case ∆E2,γ(I) vanishes.
rotator expression

In addition the perturbed rigid

E(I) = AI(I + 1) + B(I(I + 1))2,
gives vanishing ∆E2,γ(I). These properties are due to the fact that Eq. (2) is a (normalized)
discrete approximation of the fourth derivative of the function E2,γ(I), i.e. essentially the
ﬁfth derivative of the function E(I).

(4)

In superdeformed nuclear bands the angular momentum of the observed states is in
most cases unknown. To avoid this diﬃculty, the quantity ∆E2,γ is usually plotted not
versus the angular momentum I, but versus the angular frequency

which for discrete states takes the approximate form

ω =

dE(I)
dI

,

ω =

E(I + 2) − E(I)

.

q(I + 2)(I + 3) − qI(I + 1)

ω =

E(I + 2) − E(I)
2

=

E2,γ(I)
2

.

For large I one can take the Taylor expansions of the square roots in the denominator, thus
obtaining

Examples of superdeformed nuclear bands exhibiting staggering are shown in Figs 1–
2 [13, 14]. We say that ∆I = 2 staggering is observed if the quantity ∆E2(I) exhibits
alternating signs with increasing ω (i.e. with increasing I, according to Eq. (7)). The
following observations can be made:

1) The magnitude of ∆E2(I) is of the order of 10−4–10−5 times the size of the gamma

transition energies.

2) The best example of ∆I = 2 staggering is given by the ﬁrst superdeformed band of
149Gd, shown in Fig. 1a. In this case the eﬀect is almost larger than the experimental error.
3) In most cases the ∆I = 2 staggering is smaller than the experimental error (see Figs

1b, 2a, 2b), with the exception of a few points in Fig. 1b.

2.2 ∆J = 2 staggering in rotational bands of diatomic molecules

In the case of molecules [38] the experimentally determined quantities regard the R branch
((vlower, J) → (vupper, J + 1)) and the P branch ((vlower, J) → (vupper, J − 1)), where vlower is
the vibrational quantum number of the initial state, while vupper is the vibrational quantum
number of the ﬁnal state. They are related to transition energies through the equations
[38]

ER(J) − EP (J) = Evupper (J + 1) − Evupper (J − 1) = DE2,vupper (J),
ER(J − 1) − EP (J + 1) = Evlower (J + 1) − Evlower (J − 1) = DE2,vlower (J),

where in general

DE2,v(J) = Ev(J + 1) − Ev(J − 1).

∆J = 2 staggering can then be estimated by using Eq.
DE2,v(J):

(2), with E2,γ(I) replaced by

∆E2,v(J) =

(6DE2,v(J) − 4DE2,v(J − 2) − 4DE2,v(J + 2)

1
16

+ DE2,v(J − 4) + DE2,v(J + 4)).

Results for several rotational bands in diﬀerent electronic and vibrational states of var-
ious diatomic molecules are shown in Figs 3–9. We say that ∆J = 2 staggering is observed
if the quantity ∆E2(J) exhibits alternating signs with increasing J (J is increased by 2
units each time). The magnitude of ∆E2(J) is usually of the order of 10−3–10−5 times
the size of the interlevel separation energy. In Figs 7 and 8, which correspond to sextet
electronic states, the rotational angular momentum N is used instead of the total angular
momentum J, the two quantities been connected by the relation J = N + S, where S is the
spin. Several observations can be made:

1) In all cases shown, the “upper” bands (which happen to be electronically excited)
exhibit (Figs 3, 4, 7-9) ∆J = 2 staggering (or ∆N = 2 staggering) which is 2 to 3 orders
of magnitude larger than the experimental error, while the corresponding “lower” bands
(which, in the cases studied, correspond to the electronic ground state of each molecule),
show (Figs 5, 6) some eﬀect smaller than the experimental error.

2) There is no uniform dependence of the ∆J = 2 staggering on the angular momentum
J. In some cases of long bands, though, it appears that the pattern is a sequence of points
exhibiting small staggering, interrupted by groups of 6 points each time showing large
staggering. The best examples can be seen in Figs 3a, 3b, 7a, 7b. In Fig. 3a (odd levels
of the v = 1 C1Σ+ band of YD)) the ﬁrst group of points showing appreciable ∆J = 2
staggering appears at J = 13–23, while the second group appears at J = 27–37. In Fig. 3b
(even levels of the v = 1 C1Σ+ band of YD) the ﬁrst group appears at J = 12–22, while
the second group at J = 26–36. In Fig. 7a (odd levels of the v = 0 A6Σ+ band of CrD)
the ﬁrst group appears at N = 15–25, while the second at N = 27–37. Similarly in Fig. 7b
(even levels of the v = 0 A6Σ+ band of CrD) the ﬁrst group appears at N = 14–24, while
the second group at N = 26–36.

3) In all cases shown, the results obtained for the odd levels of a band are in good
agreement with the results obtained for the even levels of the same band. For example, the
regions showing appreciable staggering are approximately the same in both cases (compare
Fig. 3a with Fig. 3b and Fig. 7a with Fig. 7b, already discussed in 2) ). In addition, the

4

positions of the local staggering maxima in each pair of ﬁgures are closely related. In Fig.
3a, for example, maximum staggering appears at J = 19 and J = 31, while in Fig. 3b the
maxima appear at J = 18 and J = 32.

4) In several cases the ∆J = 2 staggering of a band can be calculated from two diﬀerent
sets of data. For example, Figs 3a, 3b show the ∆J = 2 staggering of the v = 1 C1Σ+
band of YD calculated from the data on the 1–1 C1Σ+–X1Σ+ transitions, while Figs 3c,
3d show the staggering of the same band calculated from the data on the 1–2 C1Σ+–X1Σ+
transition. We remark that the results concerning points showing staggering larger than
the experimental error come out completely consistently from the two calculations (region
with J = 13–23 in Figs 3a, 3c; region with J = 12–22 in Figs 3b, 3d), while the results
concerning points exhibiting staggering of the order of the experimental error come out
randomly (in Fig. 3a, for example, J = 11 corresponds to a local minimum, while in Fig.
3c it corresponds to a local maximum). Similar results are seen in the pairs of ﬁgures
(3b, 3d), (4a, 4c), (4b, 4d), (6a, 6c), (6b, 6d), (9a, 9c), (9b, 9d). The best example of
disagreement between staggering pictures of the same band calculated from two diﬀerent
sets of data is oﬀered by Figs 6b, 6d, which concern the v = 2 X1Σ+ band of YD, which
shows staggering of the order of the experimental error.

5) When considering levels of the same band, in some cases the odd levels exhibit larger
staggering than the even levels, while in other cases the opposite is true. In the v = 1 C1Σ+
band of YD, for example, the odd levels (shown in Fig. 3a, corroborated by Fig. 3c) show
staggering larger than that of the even levels (shown in Fig. 3b, corroborated by Fig. 3d),
while in the v = 2 C1Σ+ band of YD the odd levels (shown in Fig. 4a, corroborated by Fig.
4c) exhibit staggering smaller than that of the even levels (shown in Fig. 4b, corroborated
by Fig. 4d).

2.3 Discussion

The observations made above can be explained by the assumption that the staggering
observed is due to the presence of one or more bandcrossings [39, 40]. The following points
support this assumption:

1) It is known [41] that bandcrossing occurs in cases in which the interband interaction is
weak. In such cases only the one or two levels closest to the crossing point are aﬀected [42].
However, if one level is inﬂuenced by the crossing, in the corresponding staggering ﬁgure
six points get inﬂuenced. For example, if E(16) is inﬂuenced by the crossing, the quantities
DE2(15) and DE2(17) are inﬂuenced (see Eq. (10) ), so that in the corresponding ﬁgure
the points ∆E2(J) with J = 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21 are inﬂuenced, as seen from Eq. (11).
This fact explains why points showing appreciable staggering appear in groups of 6 at a
time.

2) It is clear that if bandcrossing occurs, large staggering should appear in approximately
the same angular momentum regions of both even levels and odd levels. As we have already
seen, this is indeed the case.

3) It is clear that when two bands cross each other, maximum staggering will appear
at the angular momentum for which the energies of the relevant levels of each band are
approximately equal [42]. If this angular momentum value happens to be odd, then ∆E2(J)
for even values of J in this region (the group of 6 points centered at this J) will show larger

5

staggering than the ∆E2(J) for odd values of J in the corresponding region, and vice versa.
For example, if the closest approach of two bands occurs for J = 31, then ∆E2(J) for even
values of J in the J = 26–36 region will show larger staggering than ∆E2(J) for odd values
of J in the same region. This is in agreement with the empirical observation that in some
cases the odd levels show larger staggering than the even levels, while in other cases the
opposite holds.

4) The presence of staggering in the “upper” (electronically excited) bands and the lack
of staggering in the “lower” (electronic ground state) bands can be attributed to the fact
that the electronically excited bands have several neighbours with which they can interact,
while the bands built on the electronic ground state are relatively isolated, and therefore
no bandcrossings occur in this case. In the case of the CrD molecule, in particular, it is
known [35] that there are many strong Cr atomic lines present, which frequently overlap the
relatively weaker (electronically excited) molecular lines. In addition, Ne atomic lines are
present [35]. Similarly, in the case of the YD molecule the observed spectra are inﬂuenced
by Y and Ne atomic lines [34], while in the case of the CrH molecule there are Ne and Cr
atomic lines inﬂuencing the molecular spectra [36].

5) The fact that consistency between results for the same band calculated from two
diﬀerent sets of data is observed only in the cases in which the staggering is much larger
than the experimental error, corroborates the bandcrossing explanation. The fact that the
results obtained in areas in which the staggering is of the order of the experimantal error,
or even smaller, appear to be random, points towards the absence of any real eﬀect in these
regions.

It should be noticed that bandcrossing has been proposed [43, 44, 45] as a possible
explanation for the appearance of ∆I = 2 staggering eﬀects in normally deformed nuclear
bands [26, 43, 45] and superdeformed nuclear bands [44].

The presence of two subsequent bandcrossings can also provide an explanation for the
eﬀect of mid-band disappearance of ∆I = 2 staggering observed in superdeformed bands
of some Ce isotopes [18]. The eﬀect seen in the Ce isotopes is very similar to the mid-band
disappearance of staggering seen, for example, in Fig. 3a.

2.4 Conclusion

In conclusion, we have found several examples of ∆J = 2 staggering in electronically excited
bands of diatomic molecules. The details of the observed eﬀect are in agreement with the
assumption that it is due to one or more bandcrossings. In these cases the magnitude of the
eﬀect is clearly larger than the experimental error. In cases in which an eﬀect of the order
of the experimental error appears, we have shown that this is an artifact of the method
used, since diﬀerent sets of data from the same experiment and for the same molecule lead
to diﬀerent staggering results for the same rotational band. The present work emphasizes
the need to ensure in all cases (including staggering candidates in nuclear physics) that the
eﬀect is larger than the experimental error and, in order to make assumptions about any
new symmetry, that it is not due to a series of bandcrossings.

3 ∆J = 1 staggering

In this section the ∆J = 1 staggering eﬀect (i.e. the relative displacement of the levels
with even angular momentum J with respect to the levels of the same band with odd J)
will be considered in molecular bands free from ∆J = 2 staggering (i.e. free from interband
interactions/bandcrossings), in order to make sure that ∆J = 1 staggering is not an eﬀect
due to the same cause as ∆J = 2 staggering.

The formalism of the ∆J = 1 staggering will be described in subsection 3.1 and applied
to experimental molecular spectra in subsection 3.2. Finally, subsection 3.3 will contain a
discussion of the present results and plans for further work.

3.1 Formalism

By analogy to Eq. (2), ∆I = 1 staggering in nuclei can be measured by the quantity

∆E1,γ(I) =

(6E1,γ(I) − 4E1,γ(I − 1) − 4E1,γ(I + 1)

1
16

where

+ E1,γ(I − 2) + E1,γ(I + 2)),

E1,γ(I) = E(I + 1) − E(I).

The transition energies E1,γ(I) are determined directly from experiment.

In order to be able to use an expression similar to that of Eq. (12) for the study of ∆J =
1 staggering in molecular bands we need transition energies similar to those of Eq. (13), i.e.
transition energies between levels diﬀering by one unit of angular momentum. However,
Eqs (8) and (9) can provide us only with transition energies between levels diﬀering by two
units of angular momentum. In order to be able to determine the levels with even J from
Eqs (8) or (9), one needs the bandhead energy E(0). Then one has

Evupper (2) = Evupper (0) + ER(1) − EP (1),

(14)

Evupper (4) = Evupper (2) + ER(3) − EP (3), . . .
Evlower (2) = Evlower (0) + ER(0) − EP (2),
Evlower (4) = Evlower (2) + ER(2) − EP (4), . . .
In order to be able to determine the levels with odd J from Eqs (8) and (9) in an analogous
way, one needs E(1). Then

(15)

(17)

(16)

Evupper (3) = Evupper (1) + ER(2) − EP (2),

Evupper (5) = Evupper (3) + ER(4) − EP (4), . . .
Evlower (3) = Evlower (1) + ER(1) − EP (3),
Evlower (5) = Evlower (3) + ER(3) − EP (5), . . .

7

(12)

(13)

(18)

(19)

(20)

(21)

For the determination of E(0) and E(1) one can use the overall ﬁt of the experimental

data (for the R and P branches) by a Dunham expansion [46]

E(J) = Tv + BvJ(J + 1) − Dv[J(J + 1)]2 + Hv[J(J + 1)]3 + Lv[J(J + 1)]4,

(22)

which is usually given in the experimental papers.

After determining the energy levels by the procedure described above, we estimate

∆J = 1 staggering by using the following analogue of Eq. (12),

∆E1,v(J) =

(6DE1,v(J) − 4DE1,v(J − 1) − 4DE1,v(J + 1)

where

+ DE1,v(J − 2) + DE1,v(J + 2)),

DE1,v(J) = Ev(J) − Ev(J − 1).

Using Eq. (24) one can put Eq. (23) in the sometimes more convenient form

∆E1,v(J) =

(10Ev(J) − 10Ev(J − 1) + 5Ev(J − 2) − 5Ev(J + 1)

1
16

1
16

+ Ev(J + 2) − Ev(J − 3)).

(25)
In realistic cases the ﬁrst few values of ER(J) and EP (J) might be experimentally
unknown. In this case one is forced to determine the ﬁrst few values of E(J) using the
Dunham expansion of Eq. (22) and then continue by using the Eqs (14)–(21) from the
appropriate point on. Denoting by Jio the “initial” value of odd J, on which we are
building through the series of equations starting with Eqs (18)–(21) the energy levels of
odd J, and by Jie the “initial” value of even J, on which we are building through the series
of equations starting with Eqs (14)–(17) the energy levels of even J, we ﬁnd that the error
for the levels with odd J is

while the error for the levels with even J is

Err(E(J)) = D(Jio) + (J − Jio)ǫ,

Err(E(J)) = D(Jie) + (J − Jie)ǫ,

where D(Jio) and D(Jie) are the uncertainties of the levels E(Jio) and E(Jie) respectively,
(22), while ǫ is the error
which are determined through the Dunham expansion of Eq.
accompanying each ER(J) or EP (J) level, which in most experimental works has a constant
value for all levels.

Using Eqs (26) and (27) in Eq. (25) one easily sees that the uncertainty of the ∆J = 1

staggering measure ∆E1,v(J) is

Err(∆E1,v(J)) = D(Jio) + D(Jie) + (2J − Jio − Jie − 1)ǫ.

(28)

This equation is valid for J ≥ max{Jio, Jie} + 3. For smaller values of J one has to calculate
the uncertainty directly from Eq. (25).

3.2 Analysis of experimental data

3.2.1 YD

We have applied the formalism described above to the 0–1, 1–1, 1–2, 2–2 transitions of the
C1Σ+–X1Σ+ system of YD [34]. We have focused attention on the ground state X1Σ+, which
is known to be free from ∆J = 2 staggering eﬀects (see subsection 2.2), while the C1Σ+
state is known to exhibit ∆J = 2 staggering eﬀects, which are ﬁngerprints of interband
interactions (bandcrossings), as we have seen in subsection 2.2. Using the formalism of
subsection 3.1, we calculated the ∆J = 1 staggering measure ∆E1(J) of Eq. (23) for the
v = 1 band of the X1Σ+ state (Fig. 10a, 10b) and for the v = 2 band of the X1Σ+ state
(Fig. 10c, 10d). At this point the following comments are in place:

1) In all cases the levels E(0), E(1), E(2), E(3) have been determined using the Dunham
expansion of Eq. (22) and the Dunham coeﬃcients given in Table II of Ref.
[34]. This
has been done because ER(1) is missing in the tables of the 1–1 and 2–2 transitions [34],
so that Eq. (20) cannot be used for the determination of E(3). In the cases of the 0–1
and 1–2 transitions, ER(1) is known, but we prefered to calculate E(3) from the Dunham
expansion in these cases as well, in order to treat the pairs of cases 0–1, 1–1 and 1–2, 2–2
on equal footing, since we intend to make comparisons between them.

2) For the calculation of errors we have taken into account the errors of the Dunham
coeﬃcients given in Table II of Ref.
[34], as well as the fact that the accuracy of the
members of the R- and P-branches is ǫ = ±0.002 cm−1 [34]. It is clear that the large size
of the error bars is due to the accumulation of errors caused by Eqs (14)–(21), as seen in
Eqs (25)–(28).

3) In Figs 10a and 10b the ∆J = 1 staggering measure ∆E1(J) for the v = 1 band
of the X1Σ+ state of YD is shown, calculated from two diﬀerent sources, the 0–1 and 1–1
transitions. If a real ∆J = 1 staggering eﬀect were present, the two ﬁgures should have
been identical, or at least consistent with each other. However, they are completely diﬀerent
(even the maxima and the minima appear at diﬀerent values of J in each ﬁgure), indicating
that what is seen is not a real physical eﬀect, but random experimental errors (buried in
the large error bars, anyway).

4) Exactly the same comments as in 3) apply to Figs 10c and 10d, where the ∆J = 1
staggering measure for the v = 2 band of the X1Σ+ state of YD is shown, calculated from
two diﬀerent sources, the 1–2 and 2–2 transitions.

We conclude therefore that no ∆J = 1 staggering eﬀect appears in the v = 1 and v = 2
bands of the X1Σ+ state of YD, which are free from ∆J = 2 staggering, as proved in
subsection 2.2.

This negative result has the following physical implications. It is known in nuclear spec-
troscopy that reﬂection asymmetric (pear-like) shapes give rise to octupole bands, in which
the positive parity states (I π = 0+, 2+, 4+, . . . ) are displaced reletively to the negative
parity states (Iπ = 1−, 3−, 5−, . . . ) [3, 4, 5, 6, 47, 48, 49]. Since a diatomic molecule con-
sisting of two diﬀerent atoms possesses the same reﬂection asymmetry, one might think that
∆J = 1 staggering might be present in the rotational bands of such molecules. Then YD,
because of its large mass asymmetry, is a good testing ground for this eﬀect. The negative
result obtained above can, however, be readily explained. Nuclei with octupole deforma-
tion are supposed to be described by double well potentials, the relative displacement of

9

the negative parity levels and the positive parity levels being attributed to the tunneling
through the barrier separating the wells [47, 48, 49]. (The relative displacement vanishes
in the limit in which the barrier separating the two wells becomes inﬁnitely high.) In the
case of diatomic molecules the relevant potential is well known [33] to consist of a single
well. Therefore no tunneling eﬀect is possible and, as a result, no relative displacement of
the positive parity levels and the negative parity levels is seen.

3.2.2 CrD

The formalism of subsection 3.1 has in addition been applied to a more complicated case, the
one of the 0–0 and 1–0 transitions of the A6Σ+–X6Σ+ system of CrD [35]. We have focused
our attention on the ground state X6Σ+, which is known to be free from ∆N = 2 staggering
eﬀects (see subsection 2.2), while the A6Σ+ state is known from subsection 2.2 to exhibit
∆N = 2 staggering eﬀects, which are ﬁngerprints of interband interactions (bandcrossings).
The CrD system considered here has several diﬀerences from the YD system considered in
the previous subsection, which are brieﬂy listed here:

1) The present system of CrD involves sextet electronic states. As a result, each band
of the A6Σ+–X6Σ+ transition consists of six R- and six P-branches, labelled as R1, R2,
. . . , R6 and P1, P2, . . . , P6 respectively [35]. In the present study we use the R3 and P3
branches, but similar results are obtained for the other branches as well.

2) Because of the presence of spin–rotation interactions and spin–spin interactions,
the energy levels cannot be ﬁtted by a Dunham expansion in terms of the total angular
momentum J, but by a more complicated Hamiltonian, the N 2 Hamiltonian for a 6Σ state
[50, 51]. This Hamiltonian, in addition to a Dunham expansion in terms of N (the rotational
angular momentum, which in this case is diﬀerent from the total angular momentum J =
N+S, where S the spin), contains terms describing the spin–rotation interactions (preceded
by three γ coeﬃcients), as well as terms describing the spin–spin interactions (preceded by
two λ coeﬃcients [35, 50]).

In the present study we have calculated the staggering measure of Eq. (23) for the v = 0
band of the X6Σ+ state of CrD, using the R3 and P3 branches of the 0–0 (Fig. 11a) and 1–0
(Fig. 11b) transitions of the A6Σ+–X6Σ+ system. Since in this case the Dunham expansion
involves the rotational angular momentum N, and not the total angular momentum J, the
formalism of subsection 3.1 has been used with J replaced by N everywhere. This is why
the calculated staggering measure of Eq. (23) is in this case denoted by ∆E1(N) and not by
∆E1(J), the relevant eﬀect being called ∆N = 1 staggering instead of ∆J = 1 staggering.
At this point the following comments are in place:

1) In both cases the levels E(0), E(1), E(2), E(3), E(4) have been determined using
the Dunham expansion of Eq. (22) (with J replaced by N) and the Dunham coeﬃcients
given in Table V of Ref. [35]. This has been done because ER(2) is missing in the tables
of the 0–0 transitions [35], so that Eq. (17) cannot be used for the determination of E(4).
In the case of the 1–0 transitions, ER(2) is known, but we prefered to calculate E(4) from
the Dunham expansion in this case as well, in order to treat the cases 0–0 and 1–0 on equal
footing, since we intend to make comparisons between them.

2) For the calculation of errors we have taken into account the errors of the Dunham
coeﬃcients given in Table V of Ref. [35], as well as the fact that the accuracy of the members
of the R- and P- branches is ǫ = ±0.001 cm−1 for the 0–0 transitions and ǫ = ±0.003 cm−1

10

for the 1–0 transitions [35]. In this case it is clear, as in the previous one, that the large
size of the error bars is due to the accumulation of errors caused by Eqs (14)–(21), as seen
in Eqs (25)–(28).

3) In Figs 11a and 11b the ∆N = 1 staggering measure ∆E1(N) for the v = 0 band
of the X6Σ+ state of CrD is shown, calculated from two diﬀerent sources, the 0–0 and 1–0
transitions. The two ﬁgures are nearly identical. The maxima and the minima appear at
the same values of N in both ﬁgures, while even the amplitude of the eﬀect is almost the
same in both ﬁgures. It should be pointed out, however, that the error bars in Fig. 11b
have been made smaller by a factor of three, in order to the accommodated in the ﬁgure.
We conclude therefore that in the v = 0 band of the X6Σ+ state of CrD the two diﬀerent
calculations give consistent results, despite the error accumulation mentioned above. The
result looks like ∆N = 1 staggering of almost constant amplitude. The reason behind
the appearance of this staggering is, however clear: It is due to the omission of the spin-
rotation and spin-spin terms of the N 2 Hamiltonian mentioned above [35, 50, 51]. As a
result, we have not discovered any new physical eﬀect. What we have demonstated, is
that Eq. (23) is a very sensitive probe, which can uncover small deviations from the pure
rotational behaviour. However, special care should be taken when using it, because of
the accumulation of errors, which is inherent in this method. This problem is avoided by
producing results for the same band from two diﬀerent sets of data, as done above. If both
sets lead to consistent results, some eﬀect is present. If the two sets give randomly diﬀerent
results, it is clear that no eﬀect is present.

It should be pointed out at this point that the appearance of ∆J = 1 staggering (or
∆N = 1 staggering) does not mean that an eﬀect with oscillatory behaviour is present.
Indeed, suppose that the energy levels of a band follow the E(J) = AJ(J + 1) rule, but
to the odd levels a constant term c is added. It is then clear from Eq. (25) that we are
going to obtain ∆E1(J) = +c for odd values of J, and ∆E1(J) = −c for even values of
J, obtaining in this way perfect ∆J = 1 staggering of constant amplitude c, without the
presence of any oscillatory eﬀect. This comment directly applies to the results presented
in Fig. 11. The presence of ∆N = 1 staggering of almost constant amplitude is essentially
due to the omission of the rotation–spin and spin–spin interactions in the calculation of the
E(3) and E(4) levels. The diﬀerence of the omitted terms in the N = 3 and N = 4 cases
plays the role of c in Fig. 11.

3.3 Discussion

In this section we have addressed the question of the possible existence of ∆J = 1 staggering
(i.e. of a relative displacement of the odd levels with respect to the even levels) in rotational
bands of diatomic molecules, which are free from ∆J = 2 staggering (i.e. free from interband
interactions/bandcrossings). The main conclusions drawn are:

1) The YD bands studied indicate that there is no ∆J = 1 staggering, which could be

due to the mass asymmetry of this molecule.

2) The CrD bands studied indicate that there is ∆N = 1 staggering, which is, however,

due to the spin–rotation and spin–spin interactions present in the relevant states.

3) Based on the above results, we see that ∆J = 1 staggering is a sensitive probe of
deviations from the pure rotational behaviour. Since the method of its calculation from the

11

experimental data leads, however, to error accumulation, one should always calculate the
∆J = 1 staggering measure for the same band from two diﬀerent sets of data and check
the consistency of the results, absence of consistency meaning absence of any real eﬀect.

It is desirable to corroborate the above conclusions by studying rotational bands of

several additional molecules.

4 Conclusions

In this work we have examined if the eﬀects of ∆J = 2 staggering and ∆J = 1 staggering,
which appear in nuclear spectroscopy, appear also in rotational bands of diatomic molecules.
For the ∆J = 2 staggering it has been found that it appears in certain electronically excited
rotational bands of diatomic molecules (YD, CrD, CrH, CoH), in which it is attributed
to interband interactions (bandcrossings). The ∆J = 1 staggering has been examined
in rotational bands free from ∆J = 2 staggering, i.e.
free from interband interactions
(bandcrossings). Bands of YD oﬀer evidence for the absence of any ∆J = 1 staggering
eﬀect due to the disparity of nuclear masses, while bands of sextet electronic states of CrD
demonstrate that ∆J = 1 staggering is a sensitive probe of deviations from rotational
behaviour, due in this particular case to the spin-rotation and spin-spin interactions. We
conclude therefore that both ∆J = 2 staggering and ∆J = 1 staggering are sensitive probes
of perturbations in rotational bands of diatomic molecules and do not constitute any new
physical eﬀect.

The number of rotational bands of diatomic molecules examined in the case of the
∆J = 2 staggering is satisfactory. For the case of the ∆J = 1 staggering it is desirable to
corroborate the ﬁndings of the present work through the examination of rotational bands
of more diatomic molecules.

ABSTRACT

In a medium where a photoreactive species produces N equally pho-
toreactive radicals, by combining the Lambert-Beer law for the decay
of light intensity, as a beam propagates into the medium, with the
kinetic equation, one obtains a generalization of the Wegscheider
equation from photobleaching theory. It is shown that this equation
can be solved exactly, but implicitly, and can be reduced to a ﬁrst
order ordinary diﬀerential equation in a single reduced variable.

Introduction

As a light beam propagates into a medium containing a various photoreactive
species the beam intensity decreases with depth due to absorption proportional
to the concentration of the active molecules as is described by the Lambert-Beer
law [1]. By combining this law with the kinetic equation one obtains a non-linear
ﬁrst order integro-partial diﬀerential equation. Situations where the N radicals
released lead to desirable eﬀects, such as bleaching and polymerization, have
been studied for many years. An extensive list of references is presented in [2].
For the case of a single species the Lambert-Beer law for the light intensity

whose solution has been known for many years [2]. Here C is the concentration,
α is the absorption coeﬃcient, and φ the quantum yield. For the case of a
slab 0 < x < L, in terms of reduced variables T = φαt, z = x/L, S0(z, T ) =
C(x, t)/C0, γ = αC0L, the solution is

S0(z.T ) = [1 + e

which is examined thoroughly in [2].

Systems are presently under investigation [4] where, not only the initial
species, whose concentration is C, but its N reaction products all have the same
absorption coeﬃcient. A similar analysis leads to the more general equation,
expressed in terms of the dimensionless variables given above,

Calculation

We ﬁrst introduce the cumulative concentration σ(z, T ) =

z
0 S(u, T )du for
which σ(z, 0) = z and σ(0, T ) = 0. Then by integrating both sides of (5) over z
R
and then diﬀerentiating with respect to z, one ﬁnds

[σ(z, T ) − N z] = −e

[σ(z, T ) − N z].

Discussion

Let us ﬁrst look at the case N = 0, which renders (5) equivalent (under
S = −S0) (mathematically, but not physically) to the Wegscheider equation [1].
By explicit integration τ = ln(eT − 1), S(ξ) = eξ(eξ + 1)−1 and we recover the
solution (4). Note that (13) is equivalent to the ﬁrst order ordinary diﬀerential
equation

(ξ) = ξ(1 + N ln ξ − ξ)

(14)

subject to an appropriate initial condition. Eq. (14) should be useful for obtain-
ing series approximations to S(z, T ). It also indicates that for N > 0 S(z, T ) is
nonanalytic along the trajectory γz = τ .

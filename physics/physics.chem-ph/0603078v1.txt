Over the past 50 years, electron-nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) has become a fairly ubiqui-
tous spectroscopic technique, allowing the study of spin transitions for nuclei which are coupled to
electron spins. However, the low spin number sensitivity of the technique continues to pose serious
limitations. Here we demonstrate that signal intensity in a pulsed Davies ENDOR experiment de-
pends strongly on the nuclear relaxation time T1n, and can be severely reduced for long T1n. We
suggest a development of the original Davies ENDOR sequence that overcomes this limitation, thus
oﬀering dramatically enhanced signal intensity and spectral resolution. Finally, we observe that the
sensitivity of the original Davies method to T1n can be exploited to measure nuclear relaxation, as
we demonstrate for phosphorous donors in silicon and for endohedral fullerenes N@C60 in CS2.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Electron-nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) belongs
to a powerful family of polarization transfer spectroscopic
methods and permits the measurement of small energy
(nuclear spin) transitions at the much enhanced sensitiv-
ity of higher energy (electron spin) transitions [1]. EN-
DOR is thus an alternative to NMR methods, with the
beneﬁts of improved spin-number sensitivity and a spe-
ciﬁc focus on NMR transitions of nuclei coupled to para-
magnetic species (reviewed in Refs [2, 3]).

In an ENDOR experiment, the intensity of an electron
paramagnetic resonance (EPR) signal (e.g. an absorption
signal in continuous wave EPR, or a spin echo signal in
pulsed EPR) is monitored while strong RF irradiation
is applied to excite nuclear spin transitions of the nuclei
that are coupled to the electron spin. Although the EPR
signal may be strong, the RF-induced changes are of-
ten rather weak and therefore it is quite common to ﬁnd
the ENDOR signal to constitute only a few percent of
the total EPR signal intensity. Many diﬀerent ENDOR
schemes have been developed to improve sensitivity and
spectral resolution of the ENDOR signal and to aid in
analysis of congested ENDOR spectra [2, 3, 4]. However,
low visibility of the ENDOR signal remains a common
problem to all known ENDOR schemes, and long signal
averaging (e.g. hours to days) is often required to observe
the ENDOR spectrum at adequate spectral signal/noise.
A low eﬃciency in spin polarization transfer (and thus
low intensity of the ENDOR response) is inherent to
continuous wave ENDOR experiments, which depend
critically on accurate balancing of the microwave and
RF powers applied to saturate the electron and nuclear
spin transitions, and various spin relaxation times within
the coupled electron-nuclear spin system, including the

electron and nuclear spin-lattice relaxation times, T1e
and T1n, and also the cross-relaxation (ﬂip-ﬂop) times,
T1x [5]. The ENDOR signal is measured as a partial
de-saturation of the saturated EPR signal and generally
constitutes a small fraction of the full EPR signal inten-
sity [2]. Since spin relaxation times are highly tempera-
ture dependent, balancing these factors to obtain a max-
imal ENDOR response is usually only possible within a
narrow temperature range.

Pulsed ENDOR provides many improvements over the
continuous wave ENDOR methods [3, 4] and most impor-
tantly eliminates the dependence on spin relaxation ef-
fects by performing the experiment on a time scale which
is short compared to the spin relaxation times. Further-
more, combining microwave and RF pulses enables 100%
transfer of spin polarization, and therefore the pulsed
ENDOR response can in principle approach a 100% vis-
ibility (we deﬁne the ENDOR visibility as change in the
echo signal intensity induced by the RF pulse, normalized
to the echo intensity in the absence of the pulse [3, 6]). In
practice, the situation is far from perfect and it is com-
mon to observe a pulsed ENDOR response of the level of
a few percent, comparable to continuous wave ENDOR.
In this paper we discuss the limitations of the pulsed EN-
DOR method, and speciﬁcally Davies ENDOR [7]. We
suggest a modiﬁcation to the pulse sequence which dra-
matically enhances the signal/noise and can also improve
spectral resolution. We also show how traditional Davies
ENDOR may be used to perform a measurement of the
nuclear relaxation time, T1n. While not discussed in this
manuscript, a similar modiﬁcation is also applicable to
Mims ENDOR method [8].

II. MATERIALS AND METHODS

We demonstrate the new ENDOR techniques using
two samples: phosphorus 31P donors in silicon, and en-
dohedral fullerenes 14N@C60 (also known as i-NC60) in

CS2 solvent. Silicon samples were epitaxial layers of
isotopically-puriﬁed 28Si (a residual 29Si concentration of
800 ppm as determined by secondary ion mass spec-
∼
trometry [9]) grown on p-type natural silicon (Isonics).
The epi-layers were 10 µm thick and doped with phos-
1016 P/cm3. Thirteen silicon pieces (each
phorus at 1.6
3 mm2) were stacked together to form one EPR
of area 9
sample. This sample is referred as 28Si:P in the text.

Our production and subsequent puriﬁcation of N@C60
is described elsewhere [10]. High-purity N@C60 powder
was dissolved in CS2 to a ﬁnal concentration of 1015/cm3,
freeze-pumped to remove oxygen, and ﬁnally sealed in a
quartz tube. Samples were 0.7 cm long, and contained
1013 N@C60 molecules.

magnetons, ~ is Planck’s constant and B0 is the magnetic
ﬁeld applied along z-axis in the laboratory frame. In the
case of 28Si:P, the electron spin S=1/2 (g-factor = 1.9987)
is coupled to the nuclear spin I=1/2 of 31P through a hy-
perﬁne coupling a = 117 MHz (or 4.19 mT) [11, 12]. The
X-band EPR signal of 28Si:P consists of two lines (one for
each nuclear spin projection MI =
1/2). Our ENDOR
measurements were performed at the high-ﬁeld line of the
1/2. In the case
EPR doublet corresponding to MI =
of N@C60, the electron has a high spin S=3/2 (g-factor
= 2.0036) that is coupled to a nuclear spin I=1 of 14N
through an isotropic hyperﬁne coupling a = 15.7 MHz
(or 0.56 mT) [13]. The N@C60 signal comprises three
lines and our ENDOR experiments were performed on
the central line (MI = 0) of the EPR triplet.

Pulsed EPR experiments were performed using an X-
band Bruker EPR spectrometer (Elexsys 580) equipped
with a low temperature helium-ﬂow cryostat (Oxford
CF935). The temperature was controlled with a precision
greater than 0.05 K using calibrated temperature sensors
(Lakeshore Cernox CX-1050-SD) and an Oxford ITC503
temperature controller. This precision was needed be-
cause of the strong temperature dependence of the elec-
tron spin relaxation times in the silicon samples (T1e
varies by ﬁve orders of magnitude between 7 K and
20 K) [14]. Microwave pulses for π/2 and π rotations
of the electron spin were set to 32 and 64 ns for the
28Si:P sample, and to 56 and 112 ns for the N@C60 sam-
ple, respectively. In each case the excitation bandwidth
of the microwave pulses was greater than the EPR spec-
tral linewidth (e.g. 200 kHz for 28Si:P [14], and 8.4 kHz
for N@C60 [15]) and therefore full excitation of the sig-
nal was achieved. RF pulses of 20-50 µs were used for π
rotations of the 31P nuclear spins in 28Si:P and the 14N

FIG. 1: Pulse sequences for Davies ENDOR experiments. (A)
The traditional Davies experiment requires long recovery time
tr ≫ T1e and tr ≫ T1n to allow the spin system to fully re-
cover to a thermal equilibrium before the experiment can be
repeated (e.g. for signal averaging).
(B) An additional RF
pulse applied after echo detection helps the spin system to
recover to a thermal equilibrium in a much shorter time lim-
ited only by T1e. Thus, signal averaging can be performed
at a much faster rate and an enhanced signal/noise can be
achieved in a shorter experimental time. topt represents an
optional delay of several T1e which can be inserted for a sec-
ondary improvement in signal/noise and to avoid overlapping
with electron spin coherences in case of long T2e.

III. STANDARD DAVIES ENDOR SEQUENCE

Figure 1A shows a schematic of the Davies ENDOR
sequence [7], while Figure 2A shows the evolution of the
spin state populations during the sequence (for illustra-
tion purposes we consider a simple system of coupled elec-
tron S=1/2 and nuclear I=1/2 spins, however the same
consideration is applicable to an arbitrary spin system).
In the preparation step of the pulse sequence, a selec-
tive microwave π pulse is applied to one of the electron
spin transitions to transfer the initial thermal polariza-
tion (i) of the electron spin to the nuclear spin polar-
ization (ii). In the mixing step a resonant RF pulse on
the nuclear spin further disturbs the electron polarization
to produce (iii), which can be detected using a two-pulse
(Hahn) echo pulse sequence [3]. A side result of the detec-
tion sequence is to equalize populations of the resonant
electron spin states (iv). There then follows a delay, tr,
before the experiment is repeated (e.g. for signal averag-
ing). Analysis of this recovery period has hitherto been
limited (although the eﬀect of tr has been discussed with
respect to ENDOR lineshape [6] and stochastic ENDOR
acquisition [16]), yet it is this recovery period which is
crucial in optimizing the sequence sensitivity.

Nuclear spin relaxation times T1n (and also cross-
relaxation times T1x) are usually very long, ranging from
many seconds to several hours, while electron spin relax-

FIG. 2: Evolution of spin state populations during the Davies ENDOR pulse sequence, for a coupled electron S = 1/2 and
nucleus I = 1/2. Legend shows an energy level diagram and also electron (πe) and nuclear (πn) spin transitions excited by selec-
tive microwave and RF pulses, respectively. State populations are shown using colored bars (see legend) in a high-temperature
approximation (a = gµBB/kT ≪ 1), ignoring the identity component and also the small thermal nuclear polarization. g is the
electron g factor, µB the Bohr magneton and B the applied magnetic ﬁeld. The ENDOR visibility, FENDOR, is measured as
change in the electron spin polarization which occurs between (ii) and (iii), or (vi) and (vii), caused by the RF pulse. After
the 2-pulse electron spin echo measurement (e.s.e.), there is a long delay, tr, before the experiment is repeated. (A) In a
typical experiment, T1n,T1x ≫ tr ≫ T1e, and so only the electron spin has time to relax — (iv) relaxes to (v), not to thermal
equilibrium (i). The second and all subsequent experiments start from this new initial state (v). The RF pulse produces no
changes to the state population, (vi) = (vii), and so the ENDOR signal is pessimal (∼ 0%). (B) One solution is to increase
the repetition time so that tr ≫ T1n,T1x, although this can lead to a very slow acquisition times. (C) A better solution is to
apply an RF pulse (πn) after the electron spin echo formation and detection. This additional RF pulse allows a faster return
of the spin system to a thermal equilibrium, e.g. after several T1e, irrespective of T1n and T1x.

tr ≫

ation times T1e are much shorter, typically in the range
of microseconds to milliseconds. In a typical EPR exper-
iment, tr is chosen to be several T1e (i.e. long enough
for the electron spin to fully relax, but short enough to
perform the experiment in a reasonable time). Thus, in
T1e,
practice it is generally the case that T1n ≫
i.e. tr is short on the time scale of T1n while long on the
time scale of T1e. With this choice of tr, during the re-
covery period only the electron spin (and not the nuclear
spin) has time to relax before the next experiment starts.
As shown in Figure 2A, the second and all subsequent
shots of the experiment will start from initial state (v),
and not from the thermal equilibrium (i). While the ﬁrst
shot yields a 100% ENDOR visibility, subsequent passes
give strongly suppressed ENDOR signals. Upon signal
summation over a number of successive shots, the overall
ENDOR response is strongly diminished from its maxi-
mal intensity and fails to achieve the theoretical 100% by
a considerable margin.

One obvious solution to overcoming this limitation is
to increase the delay time tr so that it is long compared
to the nuclear spin relaxation time T1n (Figure 2B). In
T1e, so that the entire

spin system (including electron and nuclear spins) has
suﬃcient time between successive experiments to fully re-
lax to thermal equilibrium. However, this can make the

duration of an experiment very long, and the advantage
of an enhanced per-shot sensitivity becomes less signiﬁ-
cant. From calculations provided in the Appendix, it can
be seen that an optimal trade-oﬀ between signal/noise
and experimental time is found at tr ≈
A better solution to this problem involves a modiﬁca-
tion of the original Davies ENDOR sequence which re-
moves the requirement for tr to be greater than T1n,
permitting enhanced signal/noise at much higher exper-
imental repetition rates, limited only by T1e.

IV. MODIFIED DAVIES ENDOR SEQUENCE

Our modiﬁed Davies ENDOR sequence is shown in
Figure 1B. An additional RF pulse is introduced at the
end of the sequence, after echo signal formation and de-
tection. This second RF pulse is applied at the same RF
frequency as the ﬁrst RF pulse and its sole purpose is to
re-mix the spin state populations in such a way that the
spin system relaxes to thermal equilibrium on the T1e
timescale, independent on T1n. The eﬀect of this second
RF pulse is illustrated in Figure 2C. After echo signal
detection, the spin system is in state (iv) and the second
RF pulse converts it to (ix). This latter state then relaxes
to thermal equilibrium (i) within a short tr (> 3T1e). In

this modiﬁed sequence each successive shot is identical
and therefore adds the optimal ENDOR visibility to the
accumulated signal.

−

The discussion in Figure 2C assumes an ideal π rota-
tion by the RF pulses. However, in experiment the RF
pulse rotation angle may diﬀer from π, and such an im-
perfection in either RF pulse will lead to a reduction in
the ENDOR signal. Errors in the ﬁrst pulse have the
same eﬀect as in a standard Davies ENDOR experiment,
reducing the ENDOR signal by a factor (1
cos θ)/2,
where θ the actual rotation angle. Errors in the sec-
ond RF pulse (and also accumulated errors after the ﬁrst
pulse) cause incomplete recovery of spin system back to
the thermal equilibrium state (i) at the end of each shot,
thus reducing visibility of the ENDOR signal in the suc-
cessive shots. The pulse rotation errors can arise from in-
homogeneity of the RF ﬁeld in the resonator cavity (e.g.
spins in diﬀerent parts of the sample are rotated by diﬀer-
ent angle) or from oﬀ-resonance excitation of the nuclear
spins (when the excitation bandwidth of the RF pulses is
small compared to total width of the inhomogeneously-
broadened ENDOR line). It is desirable to eliminate (or
at least partially compensate) some of these errors in ex-
periment.

We ﬁnd that introducing a delay topt, to allow the
electron spin to fully relax before applying the second
RF pulse (Figure 1B), helps to counter the eﬀect of rota-
tion errors. In numerical simulations, using the approach
developed in ref. [6, 17] and taking into account electron
and nuclear spin relaxation times and also a ﬁnite ex-
citation bandwidth of the RF pulses, we observed that
introducing topt
T1e produces about 30% increase in
the ENDOR signal visibility (however, at cost of a slower
acquisition rate with repetition time topt+ tr). In the fol-
lowing sections, we demonstrate the capabilities of this
modiﬁed Davies ENDOR sequence, using two examples
of phosphorous donors in silicon and N@C60 in CS2.

V. APPLICATION OF THE MODIFIED DAVIES
ENDOR

A.

Improved Sensitivity

Figure 3A shows the eﬀect of experimental repetition
time, tr, on the ENDOR visibility, using a standard
Davies ENDOR sequence applied to 28Si:P. Although tr
is always longer than the electron spin relaxation time
(T1e = 1 ms for 28Si:P at 10 K [14]), increasing the
repetition time from 13 ms to 1 second improves the
visibility by an order of magnitude. As shown below,
T1n = 288 ms for the 31P nuclear spin at 10 K, and there-
fore we observe that the ENDOR signal visibility is weak
(
2%) when tr = 13 ms is shorter than T1n but the visi-
∼
bility increases to a maximum 22% when tr = 1 s is longer
than T1n. The observed maximal visibility 22% does not
reach a theoretical 100% limit because of the ﬁnite excita-
tion bandwidth of the applied RF pulses (tRF = 50 µs in

FIG. 3: Davies ENDOR spectra for 28Si:P, showing the low-
frequency 31P nuclear transition line at 10 K. The spectra
are normalized with respect to the spin echo intensity with
no RF pulse applied. (A) Three spectra measured with the
traditional Davies ENDOR pulse sequence (see Figure 1A)
using diﬀerent repetition times as labeled. The same num-
ber of averages (n=20) was applied for each spectrum and
therefore the spectral acquisition times were approximately
proportional to the repetition times (i.e. 5000, 210 and 65
seconds, respectively). (B) The spectrum measured with our
modiﬁed Davies pulse sequence (see Figure 1B) using short
repetition time (13 ms) shows a comparable signal/noise to
the spectrum measured with a standard Davies pulse sequence
at much longer repetition time (1 s). topt=6.5 ms was used
in the modiﬁed Davies ENDOR experiment.

these experiments) which is smaller than total linewidth
of the inhomogeneously-broadened 31P ENDOR peak.

Through the use of the modiﬁed Davies ENDOR se-
quence proposed above, the same order of signal enhance-
ment is possible at the faster 13 ms repetition time (e.g.
T1n), as shown in Figure 3B. This is an impres-
at tr ≪
sive improvement indeed, considering that the acquisition
time was almost 100 times shorter in the modiﬁed Davies
ENDOR experiment. The signal is slightly smaller in the
modiﬁed Davies ENDOR spectrum because of the imper-
fect π rotation of the recovery RF pulse (e.g. due to inho-
mogeneity of the RF ﬁeld as discussed above). Figure 4A
shows a similar signal enhancement eﬀect for N@C60.

B.

Improved Spectral Resolution

Spectral resolution in a traditional Davies ENDOR
experiment is determined by the duration of the RF
pulse inserted between the preparation and detection mi-
crowave pulses (see Figure 1). The electron spin relax-

(52.33 MHz line) at 10 K, and (B) 14N@C60 (22.626 MHz
line) in CS2 at 190 K. An exponential ﬁt (dashed line) yields
the respective nuclear spin relaxation time T1n. In (A) the
signal intensity at short times (< 0.1 s) deviates from the ex-
ponential ﬁt due to the transient eﬀects arising from a ﬁnite
electron spin T1e time, as described in ref. [6].

what appears to be a single broad line is thus resolved
into two, corresponding to two non-degenerate ∆MI = 1
spin transitions of 14N I = 1 nuclear spin at electron
spin projection MS =
3/2. We notice the presence of a
broad oscillating background in the modiﬁed Davies EN-
DOR spectra in Figure 4A. This background matches the
signal detected using a standard Davies ENDOR, where
it is clearly seen to have a recognizable sinc-function
shape (i.e. its modulus) and thus corresponds to the oﬀ-
resonance excitation proﬁle of the ﬁrst RF pulse. As
shown in Figure 4B, this background signal can be suc-
cessfully eliminated from the modiﬁed Davies ENDOR
spectra by subtracting the signal measured with a stan-
dard Davies ENDOR.

VI. MEASURING NUCLEAR SPIN
RELAXATION TIMES T1n

As already indicated in Figure 3A, the signal intensity
in a traditional Davies ENDOR increases as the repeti-
tion time tr is made longer, as compared to the nuclear
spin relaxation time T1n. It is shown in the Appendix
T1e, the ENDOR signal

that, in case when T1n ∼
intensity varies as:

−
Thus, measuring the signal
intensity in a traditional
Davies ENDOR as a function of tr yields a measure of
T1n, as illustrated in Figure 5A for 28Si:P and in Fig-
ure 5B for N@C60. In both cases, T1n is found to be much
longer than T1e (cp. T1n = 280 ms and T1e = 1 ms for
28Si:P at 10 K [14], and T1n = 50 ms and T1e = 0.32 ms
for 14N@C60 in CS2 at 190 K [18]), as must be expected
because nuclear spins have a smaller magnetic moment
and are therefore less prone to ﬂuctuating magnetic ﬁelds
in the host environment.

Using Davies ENDOR to measure nuclear spin relax-
ation times, T1n and T2n, has been already proposed,

FIG. 4: Spectral resolution enhancement in the modiﬁed
Davies ENDOR experiment can be achieved by increasing the
spectral selectivity of the second (recovery) RF pulse, as illus-
trated for the MS = −3/2 ENDOR line of 14N@C60, in CS2
at 190 K. (A) A comparison of the traditional Davies EN-
DOR with a 9 µs RF pulse and the modiﬁed Davies ENDOR
with an additional 9 µs recovery RF pulse demonstrates a
signiﬁcant enhancement in signal intensity. If the second RF
pulse is lengthened (to 180 µs in this case), the selectivity
of the recovery pulse increases and the enhanced component
of the ENDOR line becomes better resolved.
(B) The os-
cillating background is identical in all spectra in (A) and it
can be removed from the modiﬁed Davies ENDOR spectra by
subtracting the spectrum obtained with a traditional Davies
ENDOR.

ation time T1e limits the maximum duration of this RF
pulse, and in turn, the achievable resolution in the EN-
DOR spectrum. However, there is no such limitation on
the duration of the second (recovery) RF pulse in the
modiﬁed Davies ENDOR sequence, as it is applied after
the electron spin echo detection. Thus, in the case where
the duration of the ﬁrst RF pulse limits the ENDOR
resolution, applying a longer (and thus, more selective)
second RF pulse can oﬀer substantially enhanced spectral
resolution. In this scheme, the ﬁrst RF pulse is short and
non-selectively excites a broad ENDOR bandwidth, how-
ever the second RF pulse is longer and selects a narrower
bandwidth from the excited spectrum. Note that both
RF pulses correspond to π rotations, hence the power of
the second pulse must be reduced accordingly.

Figure 4 illustrates this eﬀect for N@C60, in which the
intrinsic 14N ENDOR lines are known to be very narrow
(< 1 kHz). Increasing the duration of the recovery RF
pulse from 9 µs to 180 µs dramatically increases the reso-
lution and reveals two narrow lines, at no signiﬁcant cost
in signal intensity or experiment duration. In Figure 4B,

however the applicability of suggested pulse schemes has
been limited to cases where T1n (or T2n) < T1e [19, 20].
Herein, we extend the method to (more common) cases
where T1n is greater than T1e.

VII. CONCLUSIONS

We have shown that signal intensity in the traditional
Davies ENDOR experiment is strongly dependent on the
experimental repetition time and that the addition of the
second (recovery) RF pulse at the end of the pulse se-
quence eliminates this dependence. This modiﬁcation to
the Davies pulse sequence dramatically enhances the sig-
nal/noise (allowing signal acquisition at much faster rate
without loss of the signal intensity), and can also improve
the spectral resolution. We also demonstrate that the
sensitivity of the Davies ENDOR to nuclear relaxation
time can be exploited to measure T1n. The technique
of adding an RF recovery pulse after electron spin echo
detection can be applied to the general family of pulsed
ENDOR experiments, in which a non-thermal nuclear po-
larization is generated, including the popular technique
of Mims ENDOR [3, 8].

Appendix

Here we describe how a compromise can be reached,
using the traditional Davies ENDOR, between maximal
ENDOR ‘per-shot’ signal and overall experiment dura-
tion. The equations below show the evolution of state
populations — a quantitative equivalent of those shown
in Figure 2 in the main text, with the diﬀerence that a
partial nuclear relaxation is considered during the repe-
tition time tr. Thus, we assume T1n ∼

The intensity of the ENDOR signal is therefore:

As the signal-to-noise is proportional to the square root
of the number of samples, and thus to
1/tr, we can
deﬁne a signal eﬃciency of:

This ﬁgure is maximized when tr ≈

Abstract

We extract the dynamics implicit in an algebraic ﬁtted model Hamiltonian for
the deuterium chromophore’s vibrational motion in the molecule CDBrClF. The orig-
inal model has 4 degrees of freedom, three positions and one representing interbond
couplings. A conserved polyad allows in a semiclassical approach the reduction to 3
degrees of freedom. For most quantum states we can identify the underlying motion
that when quantized gives the said state. Most of the classiﬁcations, identiﬁcations
and assignments are done by visual inspection of the already available wave function
semiclassically transformed from the number representation to a representation on the
reduced dimension toroidal conﬁguration space corresponding to the classical action
and angle variables. The concentration of the wave function density to lower dimen-
sional subsets centered on idealized simple lower dimensional organizing structures and
the behavior of the phase along such organizing centers already reveals the atomic mo-
tion. Extremely little computational work is needed.

Introduction

In recent years we have developed methods to investigate algebraic models ( spectro-
scopic Hamiltonians ) for the vibrations of molecules [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. The Hamiltonians
reproduce and encode by their construction the experimental data [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12].
So far we have treated examples where the existence of conserved quantities allowed
the reduction of the system from four or three degrees of freedom to two degrees of
freedom. In the present paper we treat for the ﬁrst time an example, which only can
be reduced to three degrees of freedom. We show to which extent our methods still
work as before and how they reveal the dynamics of the deuterium in CDBrClF [13].
For the already known wave function ( they are needed to construct the Hamilto-
nian ) transformed from the number representation so as to be able to be plotted in the
toroidal conﬁguration space of action/angle variables [14] we show that we can visually
sort most of the states into ladders of states with similar topology. Each ladder has a
relatively simple spectrum. Complexity arises from their interleaving. We also can rec-
ognize underlying classical lower dimensional organizing structures by the fact that for
these inherently complex functions the density ( magnitude squared ) is concentrated
around them and the phase has simple behavior near them. The position of these
structures in angle space reveals the nature of the resonance interaction causing the
topology. It also allows the reconstruction, often by analytic use of the transformation
back to generalized coordinates, which are near displacement coordinates, of the motion
of the atoms which underlie this particular quantum state. By counting nodes in plots
of the wave function density and phase advances in corresponding plots of the phase
quantum excitation numbers can be obtained. In many cases, along with the polyad
quantum number itself, we thereby obtain a complete set of quantum numbers for a
state even though the corresponding classical motion is nonintegrable. These classiﬁca-
tion numbers can be interpreted as quasi conserved quantities for this particular state
or for the ladder of states based on the same dynamic organizational element. Note
there are usually several diﬀerent types of organizing structures and hence ladders in
the same energy region.

Why are the wave functions that are so visually complex as to be unsortable in
displacement coordinate space simple enough to be sorted in our semiclassical repre-
sentation ? The answer is ﬁvefold. First, when a spectroscopic Hamiltonian is used
and as energy changes frequencies can move into resonance, that is rational ratio, a
constant of the motion called the polyad number comes into existence ( see section 2
). It can be used to reduce the dimension of the conﬁguration space when the action
angle variables, which come out in taking the semiclassical limit of the spectroscopic
Hamiltonian, are used. Dimension reduction is always a great simpliﬁcation. Second,
the resonant form of the ﬁtted spectroscopic Hamiltonian can be justiﬁed formally by
using Van Vleck or canonical perturbation theory starting with a given potential sur-
face [13, 15, 16] in a way that takes in only the dominant dynamics. The terms that are
left out for the most part are multiple small perturbations that in turn cause multiple
small distortions to the wave function. This makes them harder to recognize but not
fundamentally diﬀerent. An excellent example of this is seen in [9], section 3 and quite

2

pictorially in [17] where ﬁgures 4 and 9 show the wave functions for the same states but
computed from the full and the spectroscopic Hamiltonian respectively. The simplicity
of the latter is enough to illustrate our point. The third reason for the relative wave
function simplicity is that as the bound wave functions lie on a toroidal conﬁguration
space their parts must interfere constructively as each angle is changed by 2π. This
coherence results in simpler but not always simple wave functions. The fourth reason
is in the freedom to choose a particular type of reduced dimension canonical variables.
These variables are designed with guidance from the polyad and the angle dependence
of the resonance to have zero velocity when the phase locking caused by the resonance
sets in. The wave function in reduced conﬁguration space will then in turn further
collapse onto the environs of ( in the sense of small oscillations about ) even lower
dimensional surfaces or lines. We defer explaining and exhibiting this point till section
3 which introduces needed notation. The ﬁfth reason for simplicity is that, as alluded
to above, the wave function is complex and can then be plotted separately in density
and phase. Each part helps in visually sorting of wave function topologies and therefore
dynamics and each yields the values of diﬀerent quantum numbers.

As organizational elements we do not necessarily use actual classical periodic orbits.
In many cases it is simpler to study the general ( average ) classical ﬂow and to relate
to it some idealized guiding center and to use this idealized motion as the skeletal
element on which the quantum density is concentrated. We can imagine that this
idealized structure contains the essence of a large number of periodic orbits performing
on average a similar motion. The quantum dynamics is not able to resolve all the
ﬁne details of the classical motion, nor the inﬁnity of long periodic orbits, nor their
enormous number of bifurcations. Its limited resolution only recognizes the average of
the classical dynamics over cells of the size of its resolution. Therefore we interpret the
quantum state as based on the motion of the atoms which corresponds to the idealized
structural element. In many cases one state of the group of similarly organized states
can be interpreted as the quantum ground state on this element and the other ones
are various longitudinal and transverse excitations of the basic structure, hence the
ladders. In some cases only sections of a ladder are found.

Further in this paper, we see how the higher number and smaller spacing between
observed states of a system with more degrees of freedom makes the whole investigation
more complicated and in particular how the higher density causes more mixing of
structures. This increase of structural mixing might be interpreted as one way in which
eﬀects of classical chaos enter the quantum behavior and results in a group of states
being unassignable even in the semiclassical angle representation that brought
simplicity in appearance to the density and phases of the assignable states.

In section 2 we discuss the spectroscopic Hamiltonian, section 3 presents the semi-
classical representation of the wave functions on the toroidal conﬁguration space and
section 4 contains the dimensional reduction. Section 5 explains the basic ideas how to
extract the assignment of a wave function from its plot on the reduced conﬁguration
torus. Section 6 explains how from information about the dynamics in the reduced
system we go back to reconstruct information about the original system. Section 7
contains the classiﬁcation of states and section 8 gives ﬁnal remarks.

2 The model

For the description of the chromophore dynamics of the molecule CDBrClF we use the
model set up in [13]. It is based on 4 degrees of freedom as required by the nature of
the observed overtone spectroscopy. They describe the three degrees of freedom of the
D atom ( index s for the stretch and indices a and b for two bends, where index a is for
the bend in the C-D-F plane and index b for the bend out of this plane ) and the C-F
stretch ( index f ). The algebraic Hamiltonian ﬁtted to experiment and to calculations
on a ﬁtted potential surface has a natural decomposition

One can now study each polyad separately ( second consequence of P ). Here we will
concentrate on the one 161 state polyad P = 5 which is the most complex one in the
range of measured energy.

3 Semiclassical representation

Having the
now allows us to immediately obtain, without any extra work, semi-
classical eigenfunctions in action/angle variables ( good to the lowest two orders in ¯h
). We do this because as we will see such eigenfunctions can be viewed due to the exis-
tence of the polyad as eﬀectively having one less dimension. Hence the problem must
now be transformed from the number representation to a semiclassical action/angle
representation. The drop in dimension is characteristic of classical mechanics where a
constant of the motion, here the classical analogue of P , can by canonical transforma-
tion allow one to reduce the dimension of the phase space. Here the reduction is from a
four degree of freedom system with action/angle coordinates ~I, ~φ to a reduced system
with speciﬁc value of P and three degrees of freedom with action/angle coordinates ~J,
~ψ. This of course will accomplish the ﬁrst promised simpliﬁcation, that is dimension
reduction.

To make a transition to the corresponding classical Hamiltonian we bring the oper-
ators in Hq ﬁrst into symmetrical order, and then apply the semiclassical substitution

K = Is + [Ia + Ib + If ]/2

Because of the symmetric ordering required for the transition to classical dynamics the
zero point between the eigenvalues of P and the corresponding value of K is shifted by
5/4.

The reader, as an aside, might wish to contemplate how easily this transition was
taken. For the more familiar H = T +V Hamiltonian form one must solve the Hamilton-
Jacobi equation to get such variables; indeed a diﬃcult process even if the system is
completely integrable. The simplicity is due to the fact that, as said, this should be
rigorously done starting with a potential surface and using perturbation theory. A price
is paid for circumventing perturbation theory and using a ﬁtted spectroscopic Hamil-
tonian. This price is that the relation of the a†
j and aj to the generalized momentum
and position variables pj and qj is rigorously unknown. We will return to this issue
later when going back from reduced space to displacement coordinates; our so called
lift process.

If one now quantizes any single harmonic oscillator term in Eqs.11-15 using Schroedinger

for j = a, b, f . These three angle make up a three dimensional toroidal conﬁguration
space T 3 upon which χP
k is just the Fourier decomposition of the
reduced dimension wave function on the conﬁguration torus. More rigorously the wave
function χP
j deﬁned by Eqs.19- 21 actually is the semiclassical wave function after the
classical constant of motion K is used to reduce dimension by a canonical transforma-
tion. Using the angle transformation of Eq.22 suggested above by the existence of P
plus the trivial transformation

the canonical transformation permits that the new actions are K, given by Eq.16 and

θ = φs

Jj = Ij

again for j = a, b, f . θ is the cyclic angle. Staring with equations 11 to 15 and
using equations 16, 11-24 a new Hamiltonian in the six canonical variables ~J, ~ψ albeit
parametric in P or K can now be written so directly that to save space we omit it.
The torus T 3 is the conﬁguration space. Using the Schroedinger quantization for the
new variables is only semiclassical, i.e. is correct in the two lowest orders in ¯h. Its use
gives the semiclassical expression

In the new coordinates the basis functions with polyad number P and three indices

nf , na, nb corresponds to the product of three plane waves or rotors as

exp(inkψk)

Yk=a,b,f

Each single plane wave factor loops the T 3 in the positive direction. The rotor is that
into which the single mode harmonic oscillator has been transformed. Since Eq. 25 is
a manifestly complex function it can be written as

Symmetry properties of the system in the toroidal conﬁguration space will be used in
the following. The Hamiltonian is invariant under a simultaneous shift of all angles ψj
by π. Therefore the reduced conﬁguration torus T 3 covers the original conﬁguration
space twice and all structures show up in double, even though they really exist only
once. In addition the system is invariant under a shift of any angle ψj by 2π and it is
invariant under a reﬂection where all angles go over into their negatives.

5 Methods to evaluate wave function plots

It is seen that the simple basis functions have constant density and any eigenstate dom-
inated by a single basis function has a density without sharp localization. Resonances
ωs will be seen to cause localization about a line ψa = constant.
as for example 2ωa ≈
ψs/2 = constant when diﬀerentiated with respect to time
This follows as ψa = φa −
gives the frequency relation. Hence it is seen that resonances are associated with local-
ization and the fact that dψj/dt = 0. It can be claimed that by using angle coordinates
that slow to zero velocity at resonance we here assure that the wave function will “col-
lapse” onto and about a lower dimensional subspace called the organization center.
This in reverse gives a way to recognize the inﬂuence of resonances, namely localization
of the wave function on the conﬁguration torus. Each linearly independent locking of
angles therefore reduces the dimension of the subset of conﬁguration space in which
the wave function is concentrated by 1 dimension.

The fact that the wave function is on T 3, a three dimensional torus, presents graph-
ical and visual challenges when attempting to sort wave functions by inspection. To
meet these challenges we employ the fact that T 3 is 1:1 with a cube with sides of angle
range 2π and identiﬁed opposite boundary points. That is a point on one surface of
the cube is the same as a point on the direct opposite side of the cube. The density
and phase are plotted in such cubes. The density plots now over the interior of the
cube are organized over the whole cube or about interior planes or lines or points if
zero, one, two or three independent resonant couplings respectively are active. Over
(or “along” in the case of a line) the organizing structure a smooth density with no
sharp localization should appear.

Nodal structures will be visible and countable in directions perpendicular to the
organization element and clearly will be associated with a localized direction. The
count of such transversal nodes supplies for each direction of localization a transverse
quantum number t, that replaces an original mode quantum number n which has been
destroyed by the resonant interaction. The wave function in all the localized directions
can be considered as qualitatively similar ( a continuous deformation ) of an oscillator
state of the corresponding dimension. By the superposition of the running wave basis
functions with appropriate weights and signs locally around the organization center the
nodal pattern of an oscillator is reproduced. The transverse quantum numbers tk are
the corresponding oscillator excitation numbers.

The phase functions Φ according to Eq.28 are smooth and close to a plane wave
in the neighborhood of the organization center. They tend to have jumps by π and

8

singularities away from the center. Therefore phase advances along fundamental cycles
( loops on the torus or lines that connect opposite boundary points on the cube )
of the organization center are well deﬁned and are necessarily integer multiples of 2π.
They provide longitudinal quantum numbers lk which also replace the interacting mode
quantum numbers.

Some states present what at ﬁrst look appears to be a familiar but unexpected phase
pattern in that the phase picture is too simple. Cases will appear when the density is
localized but the phase picture has the globally striped ﬂag appearance of the nearly
noninteracting mode case. The strangeness disappears if ideas from nonlinear dynamics
are employed. Nonlinear dynamics tells us that at low P most of the motion takes place
on what is called the primary zone of phase space. And the now interacting states
are quantization of tori in this region. This zone has no central organizing structure
other than the whole conﬁguration space itself.
It does contain quasiperiodic orbits
corresponding to the uncoupled modes.

As P changes coupling of a subset or even all modes can occur by at least two
mechanisms. First is one where the existing mode periodic orbits bifurcate and create
new secondary zones based with newly created organizing structures ( periodic orbits, 2
tori, 3 tori e.t.c. ). Also new secondary zones may be created seemingly spontaneously
due to what are called saddle-center bifurcations. In these secondary cases the motions
will have changed and states quantized based on tori or near tori ( think about the
resolution of ¯h ) will have density and phase diagrams as described above with (P, tk, lk)
quantum numbers.

The second mechanism of coupling which will manifest itself in density localization
is by continuous deformation; a process visualized by mentally drawing the primary
conﬁguration on rubber sheets and stretching and pulling the sheets in various direc-
tions till the localized form is achieved. Under such continuous deformation the phase
function Φ of the continuous, single-valued complex wave function Ψ( ~ψ) always must
change by an integer multiple of 2π as its argument ~ψ goes around any closed loop γ in
~ψ and that integer is nj
conﬁguration space. In our case prior to deformation Φ = ~n
·
Φ + nj2π.
ψj + 2π, Φ
if the loop is in ψj ( this loop will be called γj ) i.e. as ψj →
More generally for any Φ this can be stated as the loop integral relation

→

mj(λ) =

1
2π Zγj

dΦ( ~ψ; λ)

(30)

where mj is an integer and λ is the deformation parameter. Now under a continuous
deformation it is clear that mj or in our case nj must remain constant as a continuous
integer valued function. In our case this nj can be read oﬀ from the phase diagram as
equal to the number of revolutions of the phase along the loop γj achieved as ψj →
ψj + 2π. For the noninteracting modes the afore mentioned quantum number l is just
the n.

From the point of view of basis state mixing even though the phase is behaving as
if a single basis function is totally dominant, signiﬁcant state mixing can occur. This
can and will occur in proportion to the amount of localization of the density. Weak

9

localization tends to occur when one basis function is dominant, the one with the same
~n.

The ~n assignment holds till a small change in λ causes an abrupt change in Φ,
that is when singularities occur. At this point continuous deformation will stop. Now
since the wave function must be continuous, singularities in phase can only occur where
the density and hence the wave function is zero. For us this occurs at the nodes and
perhaps the outer edges of the localized oscillator. In short when nodes occur one can
no longer use this simple full set of ~n quantum numbers. One can still count phase
revolutions along loops inside an organized region ( parallel to the organizing center
) to get the l quantum numbers. Great care should be exercised in deciding if for a
localized density the phase is a continuation of a plane wave or not. To do this Φ( ~ψ)
must be a smooth function in the neighborhood of the loop along which one is counting
the phase revolutions.

6 Ladders and motions in displacement coordinates

Once the wave functions in their semiclassical reduced dimension representation are
diagrammatically presented and quantum numbers assigned as described in the previous
section, as will be seen in the next section, most often states can be visually sorted
and ordered into ladders of states with a given topology. Each ladder tends to lie in
the Husimi sense in one of the phase space resonance zones discussed previously. The
simplicity of sorting is due to the fact that as said an idealized classical organizing
element underlies each ladder. This structure can easily be written as a conﬁguration
space relation between the ~ψ variables. The structure will allow us to immediately
determine what type of resonance interaction is creating this structure. An approximate
procedure that transforms the variables ~ψ back to displacement space reveals the atomic
motion ( modes of motion ) whose quantization yields the ladders of states. This process
we call “lifting” and refer to it as the “lift”. We now describe the lift in a way that starts
with the least approximate and most diﬃcult to implement algorithm and proceeds to
simpler to implement ones that still retain the qualitative spirit of the motions.

To determine the key interactions we only illustrate the procedure with a simple
example. Assume that the organization structure is a line ( or ﬁber ) along ψa = 0.

stretch mode s. Other cases are similarly treated.

Now for interpretation of the motion a trajectory in the ( ~J , ~ψ) phase space need be
found which when projected into conﬁguration space should represent the organizing
element. In reverse the knowledge of the organizing element is helpful in ﬁnding an
appropriate trajectory. To start this search estimates of the actions will be useful. For
uncoupled modes the assigned nj quantum numbers using Ij = nj + 1/2 suﬃces. To
obtain estimates of the initial actions the quantum mechanical average of the Jj can

10

be used and trivially computed from the known wave functions as

< Jj >=< Ψ

∂
∂ψj |
The ladder state that is most localized should be used for this and to check an
estimate the variance can be used. With this we now have initial conditions (< Jj >
and a value of ψj on the organizing structure) with which to uses Hamilton’s equations
to get ψj(t), Jj(t). Then ﬁrst we reconstruct the cyclic angle θ by integrating

Next we undo the canonical transformation to get the corresponding φj(t) and Ij(t).

qj(t) =

The functions qj(t) will be interpreted as representatives of the atomic motion.

Diagrams in which the qj are taken as coordinates with t as parameter give the
more conventional picture of the atomic motions. In the simpliﬁed methods the av-
erage values of Ij which giving the scale of the qj motion will replace I(t) in Eq.33.
These methods are simple because again Eq.33 is used but the time dependence and
therefore the computation is suppressed and the relations gotten between the qj from
the organizing structure equation that relates φj along with the use of Eqs.23, 24.

In preparation for section 7 let us discuss a few very simple cases. First there is the
possibility that the density is distributed rather homogeneously over the whole T 3 and
the phase function comes close to a global plane wave with 3 component wave vector
(na, nb, nf ). This means no locking at all, all modes run freely with their individual
frequency and the excitation numbers of the various modes are nj read oﬀ from the
wave vector for j = a, b, f (i.e. count the revolutions as one traverses the phase diagram
in the j’th direction) and ns = P
[na + nb + nf ]/2. If the density is concentrated
in a plane, e.g.
the plane ψa = constant then the angle ψa does not move in the
long run. It only may oscillate around the value of the constant. ¿From the canonical
φs/2 = constant for the angles
transformation of Eq.22 we see that this means φa −
of the original degrees of freedom. Therefore we have frequency and phase locking
between the modes a and s. The other modes b and f run freely and their excitation
is according to the wave vector of the phase function in the plane of high density.
Analogous considerations hold for other planes of concentration of the density. If the
density is concentrated along a line, e.g. the line ψa = constant and ψb = constant
φs/2 and
( this is a ﬁber running in f direction ) then we see from Eq.22 that φa −
φs/2 are kept close to constant values and this means locking between a and s
φb −
and simultaneously locking between b and s. Of course, then also a and b are locked
relatively to each other. The mode f runs freely in this case and its excitation number
follows from the wave number of the phase function along the ﬁber of high density.
Analogous considerations will be applied for a concentration of the density along other
1 dimensional lines in reduced conﬁguration space.

7 The motion behind individual quantum states

For polyad 5 with 161 states, the given transformations and equations lead to a three
dimensional toroidal conﬁguration space which here is a cube with coordinates ψa, ψb
and ψf . Three dimensional plots of the semiclassical state functions look too often like
large globes of ink and were not informative. Here we will resort to cuts of the cube (
e.g. cut ψa = ψb) and plot density and phase in such cuts.

The question is now where to cut. Clearly a knowledge of the classical ﬂow would
be most helpful here. In it’s absence analysis as follows is also useful. The cuts should
contain organizing elements about which the density is localized. The phase should be
simple over the regions of the plane having high density. Note the idea of an organizing
structure is that one has found the conﬁguration part of the quasiregular resonant zone
of the coupled modes. The phase simplicity can be used as a tool for ﬁnding organizing
structures if they exist. Here we have used both trial and error as well as dynamics
guidance to ﬁnd the cuts.

Dynamics guidance means for example that in CDBrClF the resonance with closest
ωb and its associated ka,b in the Hamiltonian is largest. This sug-
frequency is ωa ≈
gests that modes a and b should be coupled in the plane ψa = ψb + constant which
a = ωef f
assures ωef f
. Note the constant will vary as explained below in a dynamically
meaningful way, i.e. it will be used for state classiﬁcation on a ladder of states.

b

The Fermi choice ωs = 2ωa along with ωs = 2ωb would then give by similar reasoning
the organizing line ψa = c1, ψb = c2. For some states several organizing structures
could be used and the same dynamics revealed. Our experience is to choose those
corresponding resonances which seem more important in H and which give longer
ladders of states.

7.1 Scheme for a large number of states throughout the polyad

Starting at the bottom of the polyad we ﬁnd about 64 states that deﬁnitely lie in the
Darling Dennison ωa = ωb resonance class in that they have densities localized about a
plane ψa = ψb + constant albeit often with diﬀerent constants. They also have simple
phase plots in these planes. At the lower end a few of them could also be organized
by the ωs = 2ωa, ωs = 2ωb Fermi resonances , i.e. about a line in f direction; but they
occur when stretch excitation is zero and this classiﬁcation is not very physical.

Some of the lowest states could also be assigned for all modes by quantum numbers
nj and correspond to continuous deformations of basis functions. Although these nj are
useful in the lift for obtaining actions these assignment misses the phase and frequency
locking and the localization of the density.
In addition we looked very carefully for
primary tori in the classical phase space at the corresponding energy and did not ﬁnd
any. Therefore EBK quantization cannot be applied. And classical dynamics shows
that the assignment by nj for j = a, b, f is unphysical.

To illustrate our ideas let us consider two states, state s = 4 and s = 46 at the
bottom and the middle of the ladder respectively. The former state is localized about
the plane ψa = ψb and the latter about ψa = ψb + π/2 as seen in ﬁgures 1a and 1c for

12

the former and ﬁgures 2a and 2c for the latter. Both localizations give the DD ωa = ωb
expectation. Note how only in the former case also the line ψa = π/2, ψb = π/2
could have been used as organizing center. In the diagrams all features come in double
because of the symmetry mentioned at the end of section 4. Figures 1 and 2 show that
if one stays on the organizing plane and heads say in the f direction the torus is looped
during a 2π change of ψf . This says that ψf motion is free and that on the phase
plot following any path that along which ψf →
ψf + 2π the free exp(inf ψf ) factor in
In Fig.1b or Fig.2b respectively
the wave function should go to exp(inf (ψf + 2π)).
ψf + 2π and if we count the revolutions along a line in f direction one sees
as ψf →
a phase advance of 2π and 10π respectively. We conclude that nf = 1 for state 4 (
Fig.1b) and nf = 5 for state 46 ( Fig.2b). Sometimes here nf will be usefully called lf
to emphasize that it is a longitudinal quantum number obtained by following the path
of highest density around the f loop.

The phase change accompanying a loop of the a direction in ﬁgures 1b and 2b by
the nature of the cut causes a looping on the ψa = ψb + constant plane in the complete
conﬁguration space. This looping advances both ψa and ψb by 2π and on this plane
c exp(i(~n ~ψ + 2π(na + nb)). The
the wave function must change as
choice of the ψa = ψb + constant plane required that we see a simple plane wave factor
exp(i(naψa + nbψb)) which means that all the important basis states with large mixing
coeﬃcients must have this type factor. Hence the wave function phase must advance
as we sweep ψa in this organizing plane by 2π(na + nb). We denote this by la+b, l for
longitudinal, i.e. motion along the organizing center as opposed to transverse to it.
This longitudinal quantum number clearly tells us the total number of quanta in the
Darling Dennison lock.

For state 4 in ﬁgure 1b la+b = 9 and for state 46 in ﬁgure 2b la+b = 5. Using
the polyad expression for the stretch mode we get ns = P
la+b)/2 = 0. Now
a partial ( three out of four needed quantum numbers ) assignment can be made as
(P, lf = nf , ns) or equivalently (la+b, lf = nf , ns). State 4 is now (5, 1, 0) or (9, 1, 0)
respectively and state 46 is (5, 5, 0) in both schemes as recorded in table I. In principle
na and nb no longer exist as good quantum numbers except when as explained these
numbers represent conserved integer loop integrals as in the continuous deformation
case for state 4 where both phase diagrams ( Figs 1b and 1d ) look as they represent
2D plane waves. Figure 1d then tells us that na = 0 and nb = 9. This is useful only for
obtaining Ia = na + 1/2 = 1/2 and Ib = nb + 1/2 = 9/2 which will in turn be useful in
the lift process.

−

For state 46 phase simplicity only happens in the organizing plane. Fig. 2d shows
no useful phase information. The plot shows jumps along lines and ramp singularities
where the phase value depends on the direction of approach.

At this point and in a similar way a full 64 states for P = 5 can be assigned by ns and
nf . Actually another 32 seem to resemble this picture. The resemblance is only seen
as trends from the systematic following of the 64 other ones. For these increasing but
still smaller eﬀects of many other resonances are taking their toll and they signiﬁcantly
degrade the assignable states into unassignable more heavily mixed quantum analogues
of classical chaos. The table I indicates which states have less certain assignments.

13

Certain of the states will be marked in the table as demixed states and given in
s/s′ notation, i.e. 50/51. For such pairs it will be seen that the eigenstates involved
are nearly degenerate and usually do not have the features of any of the states on any
of the ladders we identify. The near degeneracy is an indication on that possibly two
( noneigen ) states exist with even more degenerate energies that do ﬁt on ladders
but fail to appear due to mixing by accidental degeneracy. By assuming for such
eigenstates various weighted mixings the demixed dynamically characterizable states
can be recognized and included in the ladders.

For further simplifying and dynamical classiﬁcation the states of the DD ladder can
now be sorted by common values of nf and ns ( or equivalently la+b and lf ), see table I.
Clearly one quantum number is missing. In a lower dimensional problem ( e.g. [1]) in a
similar case of DD lock ( there between local stretch modes n and m ) the longitudinal
ln+m which was determined by counting phase advances along an organizing line in the
ψm = ψn direction, was complemented by counting nodes in the direction transverse
to the organizing line by using this number for a transverse quantum number t. Here
only remnants if any of these nodes are seen. The greater mixing in higher dimension
wipes out this clarifying element. What does remain common is that states with the
same other quantum numbers as above can be ordered by how far signiﬁcant density
extends into the direction transverse to the organizing plane. For the DCO this gives
the same t ordering.

Here we adopt this criterion to organize the states in the lf , la+b or nf ns sub-
ladders and also observe in Table I that this ordering simultaneously gives an energy
ordering. This t ordering number is our ﬁnal quantum number. Additional support for
our classiﬁcation comes from the classical mechanics where trajectories at eigenstate
energies ﬂowing along the organizing plane ﬂuctuate further in the transverse direction
the greater is t. Most gratifyingly each subladder has an energy spectrum that is quite
reminiscent of an anharmonic oscillator. As such locally and physically for each sub-
ladder of ﬁxed lf and la+b but varying t we envision a dynamic potential causing the
system to remain near the organizing structure. The levels of this potential are the
states of the subladders.

Even at this stage where other ladders discussed below are omitted spectral com-
plexity arises from the interlacing of energy levels of diﬀerent subladders. The roughly
96 states on the ladder which only demands the DD-a/b lock for its construction gives
a complex spectrum and nontransparent energy spacings.

The reader will note that some ladder states in table I are missing. These states
could not be found but their disappearance is conﬁrmed using the anharmonic models
expected energy spacing. Formally these states lie among the highly mixed ( chaotic ?
) states we discuss below. They are mixings of more than two dynamically identiﬁable
states and do not show the near degeneracy that our demixing process identiﬁes.

The actions Ij can be gotten for the modes s and f using Ij = nj + 1/2, in addition
we have Ia + Ib = la+b + 1. Then Ia = Ja and Ib = Jb is gotten from the state functions
using Eq.31. To observe approximate averaged motion of the Deuterium atom the Ij
can be used in Eq.32 for θ to enable us to get I(t) and φ(t) and then using Eq. 33 to
draw qualitatively pictures for the various pairs (qj, pj). Actually a great deal can be

14

q

said without the integration for θ. In (qs, qa/b/f ) planes a roughly rectangular region is
seen whose sides are proportional to √2Is and
2Ia/b/f . The deuterium trajectories
motion interior to the rectangle will be quasiperiodic motion. How the exact trajectory
depends on the initial choices of φs and ψa/b/f and is really not important.
In the
(qa, qb) plane organization structure leads to ellipses whose relative ranges ( excursion
from zero displacement ) in the (qa, qb) variables is
Ia/Ib. The ellipses eccentricity
depends on the organizing structures phase shift, viz. ψa = ψb + δ
φa = φb + δ.
δ = 0 and π give zero angular momentum and something approaching a straight line
π/2 gives maximal angular momentum and elliptical motion which
motion while δ =
becomes circular if Ia = Ib. The t value is the out of phase motion and causes the
trajectory to change slowly its eccentricity.

7.2 Scheme for the upper end of the polyad

At the upper end of the polyad we take to start states 160 and 161. A cut in ψb = 0 (
or any other value of ψb ) reveals as we see in Fig.3c for state 160 what looks like two
columns of density localized around ψa = π and ψf = π. In comparison state 161 ( not
shown ) only has one column. A cut in the plane ψb = constant is required to see that
the columns really exist. Figure 3c shows that they do for state 160 and it also holds
for state 161. Clearly for both these states the line ψa = π, ψf = π is the organizing
structure. Since it loops in ψb mode b, is decoupled and the phase picture for both
ψb + 2π along
states shows ( ﬁgure 3b for state 160, state 161 not shown ) that as ψb →
the organizing line no wave fronts are crossed and hence there is no phase advance. As
such lb = nb = 0. For the upper end of the polyad also classical dynamics shows a ﬂow
in b direction.

Now the ψa = ψf = π organizing structure implies that the phase locks are φa =
φs/2 + π and φf = φs/2 + π. Time diﬀerentiation of these relations show that the
frequency locks are of 2:1 Fermi type with the stretch mode locking with the bend
mode a and the mode f. Clearly for the organizing structure ψa = ψf or equivalently
then φa = φf is a valid phase lock and ωa = ωf is a DD 1:1 frequency lock. Since
all three types of terms appear in the Hamiltonian we can be assured that all three
frequencies are in lock and that the quantum numbers na, nf and ns no longer exist.
They must be replaced by three quantum numbers of the lock one of which can be P
and the other two can be taken as the number of nodes seen in the ψb = 0 cut along
the antidiagonal as t1 = 1 and along the diagonal as t2 = 0. For state 161 since one
column exists t1 = t2 = 0.

Table II shows the assignment for the states whose analysis is based on the same
organizing structure. Figure 3a shows a vertical cut into the cube along the antidiagonal
of ﬁgure 3c. It reveals at ψa = π a vertical nodal line corresponding to the node on
the antidiagonal line ψf =
ψa in ﬁgure 3c. The assignment of states 161 and 160 in
−
table II is complete. P
nb is the number of excitations in the three way lock and
the quantum numbers t1 and t2 tell us how much of this excitation is transverse to the
columns and therefore is a measure of the extension of the density outward from the
organizing line created by any two of the three resonances mentioned above, only two

−

15

of them are independent.

All entries in table II use the same organizing structure as these states. Two of them
needed to be demixed before being assigned. They are not continuous deformations
of basis states ( the phase functions never look like plane waves ), only the action Ib
can be obtained as Ib = nb + 1/2. Estimates of Ia, If and Is must be gotten from
computing the quantum state average of Ja, Jf and by the canonical transformations.

actions again deﬁne the maximal displacement
Clearly this range is meant in the sense that an average is made over the values of the
two variables not represented in the plane. The planes (qb, qj), j = a, f, s will show
rectangularly bound quasiperiodic motion. In the (qs, qa/f ) plane a U shaped region is
swept out. Here qa/f reaches its extreme values as qs reaches its maximum displacement
and qs sweeps its range twice for each sweep of qa/f . Increasing t1 and/or t2 causes the
lifted trajectory to oscillate in a tube about this basic U lift. Of course qf and qa reach
their maxima ( minima) in phase as the three modes s, a and f are phase locked.

7.3 Patterns in the dense region of the polyad

In the middle of the polyad there are approximately 50 states with very complicated
wave functions which we could not classify. It is possible that further and closer analysis
could reveal some systematics. These states are dispersed among the states mentioned
in subsection 7.1. But interestingly a few simple states which do not fall into any
scheme recognized are dispersed in this region.
In this subsection we present a few
such states.

State 111 has its density concentrated in the plane ψf = ψb in which plane the
phase function also comes close to a plane wave with la = 0 and lb+f = 10 ( see parts
a and b of ﬁgure 4 ); this simple ns = 0. In the density plot we see a strong tendency
towards a-b coupling but it is not perfect. The parts c and d of the ﬁgure show density
and phase in the transverse plane ψf = π/2. We see a very good concentration of the
density along the line ψb = ψf indicating t = 0 with respect to this organizing plane.
Therefore in this state all excitation is in the in phase combined DD-b/f ( bend of
deuterium and stretch of ﬂuorine ) motion. The degrees of freedom a and s are not
excited and the assignment is complete.

Numerical results for state 103 are shown in ﬁgure 5, part a and b show density and
phase in the plane ψf = 0 which is the plane of high density and thereby the organizing
structure. Part c and d show density and phase in the transverse plane ψa = π/2. We
clearly see how the density is concentrated around the planes ψf = 0 or π. In the plane
of high density the phase function comes close to a plane wave with la = 1 and lb = 4.
A few other states ( e.g. 108 and 148 ) fall into the same scheme. For the lifted motion
in the displacement space we can draw the following conclusions: a and b both run
freely with an excitation corresponding to their loop numbers read oﬀ from the phase
function in the plane ψf = 0, f is completely coupled to s in a 2:1 Fermi resonance.
P=5 and the t = 0 from ﬁgure 5c complete the assignment.

16

−

State 140, Figure 6, is an example with a concentration of the density around a
point, in this particular case the point ψa =
π/2, ψb = π/2, ψf = π/2. This means
coupling of all degrees of freedom at a particular phase value. The phase function
is rather simple globally and indicates na = 0, nb = 0, nf = 8. Because of polyad
conservation we then conclude that ns = 1. This means that all four actions are
Ij = nj + 1/2. Accordingly we have a coupled 2:1 Fermi-s/f motion whereas the formal
coupling of a and b with s is rather irrelevant since their excitation numbers are 0. This
interpretation is based on the phase function even though the density is concentrated
around a point, where logically we should classify states by transverse excitations in 3
directions ( are all zero in this particular state).

8 Conclusions

We have shown how our previously developed methods can also be applied to systems
with 3 degrees of freedom after reduction. For seventy percent of the states the strat-
egy works successfully. We investigate the wave functions constructed on a toroidal
conﬁguration space. We investigate on which subsets the density is concentrated and
evaluate the phase function on this subset of high density. This allows us to obtain a
set of excitation numbers for the states; in the best cases we obtain a complete set of
excitation numbers which provide a complete assignment of the state. The excitation
numbers can be interpreted as quasi conserved quantities for this particular state.

The success of the method is based on 3 properties of our strategy which more tra-
ditional approaches starting from potential surfaces do not have. First, we start from
an algebraic Hamiltonian which naturally decomposes into an unperturbed H0 and a
perturbation W . Perturbation theory assures us that W contains only the dominant
interactions, leaving out those that do not aﬀect the qualitative organization of the
states. In addition having the ideal H0 results in the classical Hamiltonian being for-
mulated from the start in action and angle variables belonging to H0. For a potential
surface it is very complicated to construct an appropriate H0 and the corresponding
action/angle variables. Our knowledge of the correct H0 allows the continuous defor-
mation connection of some eigenstates of H with the corresponding eigenstates of H0
which was useful for many states. Second in the algebraic Hamiltonian the polyad (
which for the real molecule is only an approximate conserved quantity ) is an exactly
conserved quantity and allows the reduction of the number of degrees of freedom. We
always deal with one degree of freedom less than the number of degrees of freedom on
the potential surface. Third, our strategy depends to a large extent on having a com-
pact conﬁguration space with nontrivial homology where the phase of the wave function
is important and where the phase advances divided by 2π along the fundamental cycles
of the conﬁguration space provide a large part of the excitation numbers. In part also
feature 1 is responsible for the importance of the phases. This is an essential diﬀerence
to working in usual position space. In total we have found a semiclassical representa-
tion of the states which is actually much simpler to view than the usual position space
one.

17

The classical dynamics of the system shows rather little regular motion and is
strongly unstable. Then the question arises in which way the quantum states reﬂect
anything from the classical chaos. We propose the following answer: In the middle of the
polyad a large number of states do not show any simple organization pattern. For some
of those states it might be that we simply have not found the right representation in
which to see the organizational center. However we doubt that this is the case for many
states. For many of the complicated states the wave function is really without a simple
structure, it seems to be a complicated interference between several organizational
structures. Then immediately comes the idea to mix these states with their neighboring
states to extract simple structures in the way as we did it for states 50 and 51. For most
of the complicated states this method does not lead to any success. This indicates that
underlying simple patterns are distributed over many states so that demixing becomes
rather hopeless and maybe also meaningless. In the spirit of reference [19] this indicates
that the density of states is already so high that many states fall into the energy interval
over which states are considered almost degenerate and mix strongly. This is a strong
diﬀerence to the systems we have investigated before which could be reduced to 2
degrees of freedom. There the density of states was much lower such that mixing only
occurred occasionally between 2 neighboring states. This stronger mixing gives some
clue as to how the quantum wave functions become complicated for classically chaotic
systems and for suﬃciently high quantum excitation.

Finally there may come up the question why we do not use some of the common
statistical procedures ( like e.g.
random matrix theory ) to treat our system when
eﬀects of classical chaos become evident in a quantum system. The answer is: We
are not satisﬁed with only generic (universal) properties of the system or with the
investigation to which extent such universal properties are realized by our system. We
aim to investigate each individual quantum state one after the other and to work out its
individual properties in order to arrive in the best case at a complete set of quantum
numbers in addition at a detailed description of the atomic motion underlying the
individual state. Previous examples have shown that our procedure provides a complete
classiﬁcation for simpler systems which can be reduced to 2 degrees of freedom. As the
example presented in this paper shows, this program is doable with good success for a
large number of states even in a system with originally 4 degrees of freedom, reducible
only to 3 degrees of freedom and with a complicated classical dynamics.

Table I

Table I: This table gives the classiﬁcation and assignment of all states organized around
planes ψb = ψa + constant. The ﬁrst column gives the number of the state ordered
according to energy. If the structure only becomes clear after demixing, then it contains
in addition the number(s) of the state(s) with which it is demixed. The second column
gives the energy in units of cm−1. The third and fourth columns give the two longi-
tudinal quantum numbers lf and la+b. The ﬁfth column gives the transverse quantum
number t. For such states where the individual quantum numbers na and nb exist,
these are given in columns 6 and 7. If these phase functions show some ﬁrst indications
of developing singularities, these quantum numbers are put in brackets. States where
the pattern is not so clear but where the general trends suggest the assignment have a

in the last column. The total assignment is (P, lf or nf , la+b or ns, t).

Table II

Table II: This table gives the classiﬁcation and assignment of all states organized around
ﬁbers in b direction. The ﬁrst column gives the number of the state ordered according to
energy. If the structure only becomes clear after demixing, then it contains in addition
the number(s) of the state(s) with which it is demixed. The second column gives the
energy in units of cm−1. The third column gives the longitudinal quantum number lb.
The fourth and ﬁfth column give the transverse quantum numbers t1 and t2.

Figure 1: Plots of density ( part a ) and phase ( part b ) respectively in the plane
ψb = ψa and of density ( part c ) and phase ( part d ) respectively in the plane ψf = 0
for the state 4. In parts a and c darker grey means higher density. In parts b and d
points with positive real part of the wave function are marked by a dot and points with
a positive imaginary part of the wave function are marked by an open circle. All frame
boundaries run from 0 to 2π

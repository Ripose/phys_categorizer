Abstract

The coupling of electronic and vibrational motion is studied by two canonical transforma-

tions namely normal coordinate transformation and momentum transformation on molecular

Hamiltonian. It is shown that by these transformations we can pass from crude approxi-

mation to adiabatic approximation and then to non-adiabatic (diabatic) Hamiltonian. This

leads to renormalized fermions and renormalized diabatic phonons. Simple calculations on

H2, HD, and D2 systems are performed and compared with previous approaches. Problem

of electronic quasi-degeneracy is discussed.

I. INTRODUCTION

Many atomic systems (e.g. molecules and/or crystals) are systems with interacting

electrons and nuclei and can be thus described by Schr¨odinger equation

HΨ = EΨ

(1)

In general case the number of degrees of freedom of such systems with coulomb interaction is

too large and even using high-performance computers to solve this equation becomes impos-

sible. Therefore the only possibility to solve eq. (1) is to suggest some approximations [1–6].

The most important approximation and also most often used is the Born-Oppenheimer (BO)

[7] and the adiabatic approximation. This approximation is based on the fact that masses

of nuclei are 1870 times heavier than the masses of electrons. This leads to the idea of

potential energy surface. Beside the many attemps to go beyond the BO approximation and

many diﬀerent approaches cartain facts are not clear completely. In this paper we decided

to study the coupling of electronic and vibrational motions by two canonical transforma-

tions namely normal coordinate and momentum transformations. Our approach is similar

to quasiparticle transformations often done in solid state physics.

In order to make our

approach more transparent we repeat here main features of adiabatic approximation. We

follow the arguments of recent Kutzelnigg’s paper [8].

Let us write the total molecular Hamiltonian as

H = TN (R) + EN N (R) + HEN (r, R) + HEE(r)

(2)

where TN (R) is the kinetic energy of nuclei, EN N (R) is the interaction between nuclei, R

denotes nuclear coordinates, r denotes electronic coordinates, and HEN (r, R) + HEE(r) is

the electronic Hamiltonian

HEN (r, R) + HEE(r) = TE(r) + UEN (r, R) + HEE(r)

(3)

where TN (r) is the kinetic energy of electrons, UEN (r, R) is the electron–nuclei interaction

term and HEE(r) represents the electron-electron interaction.

In Born and Huang [1,9]

2

approach the total wavefunction depending on the nuclear coordinates R and the electronic

coordinates r is expanded as

Ψ(r, R) =

ψk(r, R)χk(R),

(4)

Xk

where ψk are a complete set of known functions of r

that depend parametrically on

the nuclear coordinates R and where the χk(R) are regarded as unknown. The ψk are

conventionally chosen as a set of eigenfunctions of the clamped nuclei (CN) Hamiltonian,

but this is not necessarily a good choice, since this is usually not complete (without, the

corresponding continuum functions, which one cannot include anyway). Both the BO and

adiabatic approximation can be based on choosing a single term in eq. (4)

Ψ(r, R) = ψk(r, R)χk(R),

(5)

This is referred as BO ansatz. This ansatz is taken as a variational trial function. Terms

beyond the leading order in m/M are neglected ( m is the electronic and M is nuclear mass,

respectively). The problem with expansion (4) is that functions ψ(r, R) contain except bound

states also continuum function since it includes the centre of mass (COM) motion. Variation

principle does not apply to continuum states. To avoid this problem we can separate COM

motion. The remaining Hamiltonian for the relative motion of nuclei and electrons has then

bound state solution. But there is a problem, because this separation mixes electronic with

vibrational coordinates and also there is a question how to deﬁne molecule-ﬁxed coordinate

system. This is in detail discussed by Sutcliﬀe [5] . In the recent paper by Kutzelnigg [8]

this problem is also discussed and it is shown how to derive in a rigorous manner adiabatic

corrections using so called Born–Handy ansatz. There are few important steps to arrive at

formula for a diabatic corrections. Firstly, one separates oﬀ COM motion. Secondly, (very

important step) one does not specify the relative coordinates (which are to some extent

arbitrary). In this way one arrives at relative Hamiltonian Hrel [8] with trial wavefunction

Ψrel. If we make BO ansatz

Ψrel = ψ(· · · ρlk, · · · ρµν · · ·)χ(· · · ρµν · · ·)

(6)

3

where ρlk, ρµν are non-speciﬁed relative coordinates and ψ is chosen as a solution of the CN

Schr¨odinger equation. The adiabatic correction ∆E take very simple form

(7)

(8)

(9)

This formula was used by Handy [10]. It was used previously also by Sellers and Pulay

[11]. (See also Davidov [9] for derivation). For practical calculation the identity

when

Note that practically in any textbook [9] the validity of BO approximation is justiﬁed only

when ω is the frequency of harmonic vibrations arround the point R0.

The aim of this paper is twofold:

i, We show how starting with molecular Hamiltonian (2) in crude adiabatic representa-

tion we arrive at adiabatic Hamiltonian by performing canonical transformations which mix

together the electronic and vibrational motions (through normal coordinates). We derive

simple formulae for adiabatic corrections, similar to eq. (7).

ii, We generalize canonical transformations (through momenta) arriving at non–adiabatic

Hamiltonian. We introduce the idea of quasiparticles (renormalized electrons) and present

the formulae how to obtain the ”orbital energies”, ”correlation corrections” and non–

adiabatic frequencies for these quasiparticles. Finally, we perform some simple model cal-

culations to demonstrate how the method works.

Let us start with electronic Hamiltonian (3) which we denote

HEN (r, R) + HEE(r) = h + ν0,

(10)

where h is the one-electron part representing the kinetic energy of the electrons and electron-

nuclear attraction term, and v0 is the two electron part of the Hamiltonian corresponding

to electron-electron repulsion term. For the purpose of diagrammatic many-body pertur-

bation theory it will be eﬃcient to work in second quantization formalism. The electronic

Hamiltonian (10) has the form

of freedom (in fact 3N degrees of which 6 are zero). Hamiltonian (12) has only bound-state

solutions. Let us divide individual terms of the Hamiltonian (12) into two parts. Namely

caculated at point Ro and the terms which are shifted with respect to term at Ro (we use

The term H

E is the electron correlation operator, the term H

F corresponds to phonon-

phonon interaction and H

I corresponds to electron-phonon interaction. If we analyze the

′

last term H

I we see that when using crude approximation this corresponds to such phonons

that force constant in eq. (17) is given as a second derivative of electron–nuclei interaction

with respect to normal coordinates. Because we used crude adiabatic approximation in which

minimum of the energy is at the point Ro , this is also reﬂected by basis set used. Therefore

this approximation does not properly describes the physical vibrations i.e.

if we move the

nuclei, electrons are distributed according to the minimum of energy at point Ro and they do

not feel correspondingly the R dependence. The perturbation term H

′

I which corresponds

7

to electron–phonon interaction is too large and thus perturbation theory based on splitting

given by eq. (19, 20) will not converge [13]. Natural way to improve this situation will be to

use basis set which is generally R dependent. We can do this in second–quantized formalism

in a way that we pass from electron creation (annihilation) operators a+

Ro dependent basis set to a new fermion creation (annihilation) operators

P (aQ) which act on

−
a
P (

on R dependent basis. Similar transformation was studied for solid state theory by Wagner

[14], who also discuss the convergency properties of adiabatic approximation [15]. This we

can achieve by canonical transformation passing from old electron operators a+

P (aQ) to new

operators

P (

adiabatic Hamiltonian to what is called clamped nucleus Hamiltonian and corresponding

clamped nucleus wavefunction Ψ(r, R). The proof that this is a canonical transformation is

in [12].

As we have shown in [12,19] this quasiparticle transformation leads from crude adiabatic

to adiabatic Hamiltonian. This Hamiltonian (39) is adiabatic Hamiltonian. Note that the

force constant for harmonic oscilators is given as second derivative of ESCF at point Ro .

We shall call the corresponding phonons as adiabatic phonons.

III. DIABATIC CANONICAL TRANSFORMATION

In previous part we developed canonical transformation (through normal coordinates)

by which we were able to pass from crude adiabatic to adiabatic Hamiltonian. We started

with crude adiabatic molecular Hamiltonian on which we applied canonical transformation

where operators

−
b (

B = b + b+ is the normal coordinate. The coeﬃcients CP Q (drP Q) can be found from the

solution of CPHF equations. We also found that adiabatic corrections can be calculated as

perturbation corrections, which mean that we expect that adiabatic corrections represents

small perturbation. The situation can be more complex if we cannot treat non-adiabaticity

as a perturbation. This is the case when non-adiabaticity can cause strong coupling between

two or more electronic states. In order to treat such situations we can procede in a way in

which we generalize transformations (25)-(28). In these equations the expansion coeﬃcients

C and d were functions of normal coordinates B = b + b+.

12

The generalization can be done in a way that these coeﬃcients are some general functions

CP Q(b, b+) and drP Q(b, b+) of b and b+ operators. We can expect that these coeﬃcients will

be not only the function of normal coordinate B = b+b+ but also the function of momentum

˜B = b − b+. Therefore general transformations will have the form [20,19]

(50)

Such transformations would be rather complex, therefore we try simple approximation

Further we can procede similarly as in the case of adiabatic approximation. We shall

not present here the details. These are presented in [20,19]. We just mention the most

important features of our transformation (46-50). Firstly, when passing from crude adiabatic

to adiabatic approximation the force constant changed from second derivative of electron–

nuclei interaction u(2)

SCF to second derivative of Hatree–Fock energy E(2)

SCF . Therefore when

performing transformation (46-50) we expect change of force constant and therefore change

of the vibrational part of Hamiltonian

HB = Ekin( ˜B) + Epot(B)

(51)

The potential energy is determined by the quadratic part of the nuclear energy E2

N N (B)

as well as by some potential energy V (2)

N (B) which is a quadratic function of coordinate

operators and has its origin in the interaction of the electrons with the vibrating nuclei.

Therefore we have

13

Epot(B) = E(2)

N N (B) + V (2)

N (B)

(52)

In the case of kinetic energy term this was identical with the kinetic energy of the nuclei in the

case of adiabatic approximation. In the case of the breakdown of adiabatic approximation

we have to remember the ﬁnite mass of electrons and therefore to introduce more general

If we look at eq. (41) we see that we have corrections due to non–adiabaticity to one-particle

part as well as to two-particle part. We see the hierarchical structure of our Hamiltonian. If

the non–adiabatic coupling is small i.e. ˜C goes to zero and we have adiabatic Hamiltonian.

If this coupling is strong we cannot use adiabatic approximation but we have to work with

full V-E Hamiltonian (54).

IV. CALCULATIONS

In order to compare our approach with other approaches dealing with adiabatic correc-

tions we perform simple model calculations for adiabatic corrections to ground state energy.

We start with adiabatic Hamiltonian (32). We now perform the following approximation.

We limit ourselves to ﬁnite orders of Taylor expansion of the operators H

use similar approximation as in [23]. The diagrammatic representation of our approximate

The adiabatic corrections to the ground state of H2, HD, and D2 we shall calculate using

second–order Rayleigh–Schr¨odinger many-body perturbation theory (RS–MBPT) and our

Hamiltonian (76). If we assume that we know the solution of the unperturbed Schr¨odinger

Since our sets of boson creation and annihilation operators and fermion creation and an-

nihilation operators commute we can write our unperturbed wavefuntion | ϕo > as the

product of the fermion state vector | ψo > and the boson state vector | χo > , i.e.

| ϕo >=| ψo > | χo >

(83)

Further we want to study the nonadiabatic corrections to the ground state. Therefore

| ψo > will be the unperturbed ground state wave function (we shall use Hartree–Fock

ground state Slater determinant –Fermi vacuum) and | χo > will be boson ground state

–boson vacuum | 0 >.

We shall not present all terms for perturbation corrections from the right hand side of

corrections and adiabatic corrections [23]. We shall pay attention only to adiabatic correc-

tions given through second-order term in eq. (85). Analyzing diagrammatic contributions

through the Hamiltonian (76) we ﬁnd that the adiabatic corrections are given through the

second up to fourth term in eq. (41). From these terms we calculate only contributions from

the ﬁrst and the second term which are given through the ﬁrst order of Taylor expansion and

these terms are used in second order RS–MBPT. We obtain the following simple expressions

For the notation see [20,23]. We believe these three terms on right hand side of (87) rep-

resents the dominant contributions to adiabatic corrections. The last formula is valid due

to the eq. (9). This formula was used to calculate the adiabatic corrections to the ground

state energy of the H2, D2, and HD, molecules. Results in cm−1 are presented in Table I.

We see that the structure of this formula is similar to eq. (7) except that we use RS–MBPT.

We also used the same approach to calculate the adiabatic corrections to the energies of

the ﬁrst vibrational transitions for the same molecules [23]. Analyzing eq. (87) we can see

that the ﬁrst term on the right hand side of eq.(87) is always positive and correspond to

largest contribution, while the second term on right hand side of eq. (87) is always negative

and represents smaller contribution than the previous term. Therefore we can expect that

the eq. (87) should converge to the true value of adiabatic correction from above. This

also explain the larger values for H2, D2, and HD adiabatic correction obtained through

eq. (87) than true value obtained by Wolniewicz [24]. Another source of diﬀerence can be

basis set used and also the contribution from other terms in (41). In our calculation we

have obtained for H2 value of 136.89 cm−1 using Roos Augmented Triple Zeta ANO [25]

basis set. Handy [10] using basis set of similar quality as used in our calculations obtained

value 101 cm−1. Similar value of adiabatic correction was obtained also in an older study by

Wolfsberg [26]. Kutzelnigg [27] in his paper using wave function expansion consisting 1200

functions obtained Wolniewicz [24] value 114.591 cm−1. It is apparent that calculations of

adiabatic corrections are strongly basis set dependent.

V. CONCLUSIONS

In this article we performed simple model calculations of adiabatic corrections for ground

state energy of the H2, HD, and D2 molecules. The corrections were derived through canoni-

cal transformation applied to crude adiabatic molecular Hamiltonian. These transformations

mix together electrons and phonons (normal coordinate canonical transformation) leading

to adiabatic molecular Hamiltonian. Using second quantization formalism and many–body

21

diagramatic perturbation theory and splitting the adiabatic Hamiltonian into unperturbed

part and perturbation we derived the formulae for adiabatic corrections. The results were

compared with the obtained by diﬀerent approaches by Wolniewicz [24] and recently by

Kutzelnigg [27]. The quasiparticle canonical transformations were then generalized in a

way that electrons and phonons are mixed not only through the normal coordinate but

also through the momenta. This canonical transformation leads to non–adiabatic molecular

Hamiltonian (motion of electrons does not follow the motion of nuclei, the electrons are

phase shifted with respect to nuclei). One can clearly see that the electronic and vibrational

motion cannot be separated. The mixed system behaves as one whole quasiparticle (mixed

electrons and phonons through the last (momentum) transformation behaves as a renormal-

ized fermions and a diﬀerent mixture of electrons and phonons leads to renormalized bosons).

This in some extent analogous to the introduction of quasiparticles in the solid state theory,

where the ”bare” electron interacting with quantized lattice vibrations is renormalized to

”absorb” some part of this interaction, and this quasiparticle is known as a polaron. We

were able to derive equations for non–adiabatic ˜C coeﬃcients, which permits us to calculate

the so called mass polarization terms and thus non–adiabatic phonons. It is interesting that

the quasiparticles preserves some interesting features known from pure electronic molecular

Hamiltonian calculations e.g. we can speak about orbital energies of a new quasipartcles,

correlation energies of of a new quasipartcles, Hartree–Fock energy (holes and particles),

etc. Further very important property which follow from the last canonical (momentum)

transformation is that we clearly see that in the case of electronic quasidegeneracy when ˜C

coeﬃcients are non-negligible (non–adiabaticity is not a small correction) we should work

with a full non–adiabatic Hamiltonian. In the case when non–adiabaticity is a small cor-

rection and ˜C coeﬃcients are negligible, we can work with adiabatic Hamiltonian (we have

only C coeﬃcients through CPHF equations) and only if system is perfectly separable that

even C coeﬃcients are negligible we can work with purely electronic Hamiltonian.

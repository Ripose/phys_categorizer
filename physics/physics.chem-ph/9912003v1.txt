A simple scaling law between the total energy of a free atom
and its atomic number

A simple, approximate relation is found between the total energy of a free atom and its atomic
number: E ≃ −Z2.411
. The existence of this index is inherent in the Coulomb and many-body
nature of the electron-electron interaction in the atomic system and cannot be fabricated from the
existing fundamental physical constants.

In a recent work on the calculation of the cohesive
energy of elemental crystals, [1] we have calculated the to-
tal energy for all atoms with Z≤92. Our calculations were
based on the density functional theory with the local den-
sity approximation. [2] Parameterization of the exchange-
correlation interaction is that of Hedin-Lundqvist. [3] For
the ﬁrst time, we plotted the total energy (E) versus the
atomic number (Z) curve (Fig. 1), in an attempt to gain
some physical insight into the density functional theory.
Surprisingly, it is found that this curve can be very well
ﬁtted by a scaling law

E = −Z n, n = 2.411

To make the E ∼ Z relation more illustrative, the
n ∼ Z curve is plotted in Fig. 2 (down triangles)). The
power index n is almost constant (close to 2.41) for atoms
with 4 ≤ Z ≤ 92. If there is no interaction between elec-
trons, n = 3; and if there is only one electron outside this
nucleus, n = 2. Since the electron-electron interaction
increases the total energy (i.e., less negative), n should
meet 2 < n < 3. The existence of such a near-constant
power index is astounding because, due to the complex-
ity of the quantum many-body problem, it’s never been
expected that the total energy of an atom other than hy-
drogen should have so simple a relation with its atomic
number.

Exceptions occur in the cases of hydrgen, helium,
and lithium. For hydrogen, Z = 1 and E = −0.976 Ry,
therefore, n has no deﬁnite value. For helium and
lithium, n=2.506 and 2.447, respectively, apparently
larger than 2.41. Experimental data [4], which is non-
relativistic and available up to argon, are denoted by
triangles in Fig.2. Also listed are the calculated power
index from Desclaux’s Hartree-Fock atomic total energy
data. [5] Open circles represent non-relativistic treatment

and solid circles denote relativistic treatment. It is seen
that all these four groups of n have values with very lim-
ited diviation. It’s then concluded that the scaling law is
not an outcome of the density functional theory, where
both the exchange and correlation interactions are con-
sidered, nor a result of the Hartree-Fock approximation,
in which only the exchange interaction is counted. Al-
though relativistic eﬀects makea diﬀerence in the index
n, the approximate scaling law holds for both cases.

As ionization potentials show very strong eﬀects of
chemical periodicity, it is of much interest to see whether
they exert a periodic eﬀect on the atomic total energy
too. We replot the n ∼ Z curves in Fig.3, a higher res-
olution graph. n shows apparent oscillatory behavior for
atoms lighter than krypton. But for heavier atoms, it dis-
plays monotonic character. This is due to the fact that
the ionization potentials are so small as to be averaged
out for the heavy atoms. It is worth noting that the solid
circle denoting Desclaux’s relativistic francium falls out
of the otherwise smooth curve. There must be an abrupt
mistake, probably a typo, in the reported total atomic
total energy of francium.

From the comparisons between density functional
theory and Hartree-Fock approximation, relativistic and
non-relativistic treatments, we can conclude that the ex-
istence of such a simple relation between the total energy
of an atom and its atomic number is independent of the
framework in which the calculations of atomic total en-
ergy are carried out. It is inherent in the Coulomb and
many-body nature of the atomic system. Apparently,
this power index cannot be fabricated from the existent
fundamental physical constants such as ¯h, c, e, etc., and
can only be built into a new many-body quantum theory.

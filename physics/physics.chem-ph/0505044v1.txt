It is demonstrated that weakly bound van der Waals complexes can dissociate in
a magnetic ﬁeld through coupling between the Zeeman levels. The Zeeman predisso-
ciation process is shown to be eﬃcient and it can be controlled by external magnetic
ﬁelds.

Manipulating dynamics of molecules with external ﬁelds has long been a sought-after
goal of experimental and theoretical research. Several groups have studied elastic and in-
elastic collisions of ultracold alkali atoms in the presence of Feshbach scattering resonances
[1–6].
It was found that the probabilities of elastic collisions and inelastic energy trans-
fer undergo dramatic changes near Feshbach resonances. The Feshbach resonances can be
tuned by bias magnetic ﬁelds so that atom-atom ultracold collisions can be controlled. Ul-
tracold molecules have been created by linking ultracold atoms with magnetic ﬁelds [7]. The
creation of molecules at subKelvin temperatures has opened up possibilities for controlling
molecular interactions with electric ﬁelds [8]. External ﬁelds break the isotropy of space and
may induce couplings between electronic states otherwise uncoupled [9]. Forbidden elec-
tronic transitions may thus become allowed in an external ﬁeld and the probabilities of the
electronic transitions can be controlled by the strength of the external ﬁeld [9].

In this work we study predissociation of weakly bound van der Waals complexes con-
taining atoms with non-zero electronic orbital angular momentum in a magnetic ﬁeld when
transitions to lower magnetic levels release enough energy to break the van der Waals bond.
The predissociation is due to coupling between diﬀerent Zeeman energy levels of the com-
plex. We show that the Zeeman predissociation dynamics can be eﬃcient and the molecules,
while stable at zero magnetic ﬁeld, quickly decompose in a magnetic ﬁeld.

Figure 1 illustrates the idea of the Zeeman predissociation. Consider a van der Waals
complex of an open-shell atom (A) with non-zero electronic orbital angular momentum and
a closed-shell atom or molecule (B) in a magnetic ﬁeld. The AB complex can be described
by a set of coupled potential energy curves correlating with diﬀerent Zeeman energy levels
of atom A. At zero magnetic ﬁeld, the Zeeman energy levels are degenerate and the complex
is stable. An external magnetic ﬁeld splits the Zeeman energy levels and bound states of the
complex may be higher in energy than some of the Zeeman levels of the separated A and
B. The AB molecule can then dissociate through transitions to these Zeeman levels. The
predissociation lifetime depends on the strength of the coupling between the Zeeman levels.

If atom A is in an electronic S-state, the A-B interaction is independent of spin and the
Zeeman energy levels are not coupled but they are if atom A is in a state with non-zero
orbital angular momentum. If B is a closed-shell atom, the A-B interaction potential can
be expanded in a Legendre series [10]

where R is the interatomic distance, ˆR is the unit vector with the direction of R, ˆr denotes
collectively the position vectors of the open-shell electrons and the expansion coeﬃcients
Vλ(R) can be expressed in terms of the non-relativistic interaction potentials of the AB
molecule [11]. The vector sum of the electronic orbital L and spin S angular momenta gives
the total electronic angular momentum Ja of atom A. The asymptotic R = ∞ states of the
AB complex in a magnetic ﬁeld are characterized by the rotational angular momentum l
of AB and the projections ml and M of l and Ja on the magnetic ﬁeld axis, respectively
[9]. The magnetic ﬁeld couples the states of diﬀerent total angular momentum Ja, but
not the M-states, so that the Zeeman transitions are induced by the couplings between
states |JaMlmli and |J ′
li. The integrals over the wavefunctions |JaMlmli with the
interaction potential (1) can be evaluated analytically to yield [9]

where symbols in parentheses and curly braces are 3j- and 6j-symbols. Eq. (2) establishes
that the Zeeman energy levels are coupled by the anisotropic part of the interaction potential
(1). Because the interaction of atoms with non-zero L depends strongly on the relative
orientation of ˆR and ˆr, the Zeeman couplings are signiﬁcant in the van der Waals complexes
with such atoms.

To form an idea of lifetimes for the Zeeman predissociation in complexes with open-shell
atoms, we analyzed the predissociation of the He-O(3P ) molecule in a magnetic ﬁeld. The
ground state of oxygen is 3P2. It splits into ﬁve Zeeman levels with energies approximately
equal to 3BµBM/2, where µB ≈ 0.47 cm−1/Tesla. This suggests that the HeO molecules
bound by 11.2 cm−1 or less may undergo the Zeeman predissociation at B = 4 Tesla. The
ground state of the He-O(3P ) complex is characterized by two non-relativistic potentials
of Σ and Π symmetry [12]. Although the well depths of the potentials are only 9.4 and
20.9 cm−1, respectively, they support several bound states. To identify the predissociating
states, we computed the S-matrix eigenphase sum for He - O(3P ) collisions on a dense grid
of energies below the M = +2 threshold. The theory of the scattering calculations has
been described in our preceding paper [9]. The eigenphase sum is obtained by summing
the inverse tangents of the eigenvalues of the K-matrix [13]. The eigenphase sum rises with
energy by π near an isolated resonance [14].

Figure 2 shows the eigenphase sum for He-O(3P ) as a function of energy and external
magnetic ﬁeld. When oxygen is in the 3P2 state, there are no couplings between the states

2

of odd and even partial waves l (cf. Eq. 2). Five Zeeman levels corresponding to Ja = 2
and three states of the orbital angular momentum, l = 0, 2 and 4, are included in these
calculations with the ﬁxed total angular momentum projection M + ml = 2. The spin-orbit
excited states of oxygen are separated from the Ja = 2 state by 158.1 and 226.6 cm−1, so
they were neglected. The number of resonances becomes larger and the resonances broaden
with increasing magnetic ﬁeld. The lifetimes of the metastable states can be computed
from the energy derivative of the eigenphase sum at the positions of the resonances [13].
To make sure that our calculations are correct, we computed the derivatives both by the
ﬁnite diﬀerence method and analytically from piecewise Chebyshev approximations of the
eigenphase sum. The positions and lifetimes of the resonances of Fig. 2 are summarized in
Table 1. The lifetimes decrease by almost two orders of magnitude as the magnetic ﬁeld
increases from 0.1 to 3 Tesla.

The rise of the eigenphase sum in Fig. 2 is due to the predissociating states or shape
resonances in open channels. To verify that we do observe the Zeeman predissociation, we
computed the bound states of the O(3P2)-He complex as a function of the magnetic ﬁeld. To
do that, we diagonalized the Hamiltonian of the O(3P2)-He complex at zero magnetic ﬁeld
using a Hund’s case (e) representation for the atomic wave functions [15] and a Fourier basis
discrete variable representation (DVR) of Colbert and Miller [16] for the radial part of the
wave function. The bound states are characterized by the value of total angular momentum
J = Ja + l, parity ǫ = (−1)L+l and a quantum number s describing the stretching motion of
the nuclei (see Table 2). To conﬁrm the accuracy of our results, we repeated the calculation
in the Hund’s case (c) representation of the molecular functions. The total Hamiltonian was
then diagonalized in the fully uncoupled representation (2) as a function of the magnetic
ﬁeld strength. This procedure yields converged results for the bound energy levels and the
predissociating states with lifetime > 10−9 sec, which was veriﬁed by the close coupling
calculations. As the lifetime of the predissociating states becomes smaller than 10−9 sec,
the DVR calculations converge very slowly and the close coupling calculation was used to
obtain the magnetic ﬁeld dependence of the predissociating states at high magnetic ﬁelds.
The close coupling solution at high magnetic ﬁelds was matched with the DVR results at
low ﬁelds to provide the magnetic ﬁeld dependence of the energy levels in the full interval of
magnetic ﬁelds considered. This allowed us to identify three resonances in Fig. 1 and Table
1 with the quantum numbers Ja and s. The fourth resonance is a shape resonance.

When the strength of the magnetic ﬁeld increases, more Zeeman levels become ener-
getically accessible and the dissociation can occur through transitions to more states. The
energy gap between the initial and ﬁnal energy levels is larger in higher magnetic ﬁelds and
the wave packet escapes faster over the centrifugal barriers in the outgoing channels. At
the same time, more bound states become open for predissociation in higher magnetic ﬁelds
(see Fig. 1). Thus the number of metastable states and the dissociation eﬃciency increase
with increasing ﬁeld strength.

The lifetimes of the bound states decaying through the Zeeman predissociation are small
(see Table 1) indicating that the Zeeman levels in He-O(3P ) are strongly coupled. Yet, it
should be expected that the degree of anisotropy is smaller in the HeO complex than in
most other van der Waals complexes containing atoms with non-zero L. The strength and
anisotropy of interaction of oxygen with other rare gas atoms are larger [12]. The degree of
anisotropy is also larger in complexes containing D-state atoms [17].

If A is an open-shell atom and B is a Σ-state diatomic molecule, the angular expansion
of the A-B interaction potential is analogous to that of two diatomic molecules [18]. It can
be written in the form [19]

where ˆrA is the same as ˆr in Eq. (1) and ˆrB describes the orientation of molecule B in the

Eq. (4) shows that in addition to the anisotropy of interaction due to relative rotation of
vectors ˆrA and ˆR, the Zeeman transitions can be induced by the anisotropy of interaction
arising from relative rotation of vectors ˆrA and ˆrB. While the Zeeman transitions in atom-
atom systems described by Eq. (1) must always be accompanied by changes of the orbital
angular momentum projection ml, the Zeeman transitions in atom-molecule collisions may
occur without any change of ml. The orientation of the electronic momentum Ja may be
transferred to the rotational angular momentum N of the molecule. The interaction between
the Zeeman levels will therefore be generally stronger in complexes of open-shell atoms with
molecules.

In summary, we have demonstrated that weakly bound van der Waals complexes contain-
ing atoms with non-zero electronic orbital angular momentum can dissociate in a magnetic
ﬁeld through coupling between the Zeeman energy levels. The lifetimes for the Zeeman
predissociation are small at laboratory moderate magnetic ﬁelds. They are similar to the
lifetimes for rotational predissociation of triatomic van der Waals complexes such as Ar-HCl
[13]. Unlike ro-vibrational or electronic predissociation, the Zeeman predissociation can be
controlled by an external magnetic ﬁeld.

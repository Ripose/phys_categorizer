I. INTRODUCTION

In the present work clusters of three and four helium atoms are investigated. In recent

years such systems had attracted growing attention due to development of experimental

techniques allowing to observe and to study two and three-particle Helium clusters1,2 and as

a result of theoretical developments which made possible the construction of realistic pair
potentials ab initio3–8.

The last two decades have been signiﬁcant progress in the investigation of few-body

systems. This progress rests on the development of new techniques for solving Faddeev

and Yakubovsky (FY) equations9,10,13,14 for wave function components and growing power

of computer facilities that allowed to reach higher accuracy in the branch of Monte-Carlo

techniques. Though equivalent to Schr¨odinger equation the system of FY equations has

signiﬁcant advantages over the Schr¨odinger one. These advantages have their origin in

a proper choice of wave function decomposition into the components. The equations are

constructed so that only one pair potential enters the equation for a particular component

provided that the interaction in the system is given in terms of pairwise potentials. This

nice feature leads to very simple boundary conditions for the components and simpliﬁes

their numerical approximation signiﬁcantly. Traditionally Yakubovsky equations are used
in nuclear physics11–18. In spite of strong mathematical background and eﬀective numerical

techniques developed for Faddeev and Yakubovsky equations only a few papers devoted to

molecular physics exploiting the technique of Faddeev or Yakubovsky equations are known.
Most of them are devoted to a system of Helium trimer19–23. No four-body calculations of

molecular systems based on Yakubovsky equations are known to the authors up to now.

The aim of the present paper is to take the ﬁrst step towards wider exploiting the rigorous

and eﬀective technique of Yakubovsky equations in molecular and chemical physics.

The numerical scheme exploited in this paper to solve diﬀerential Yakubovsky equations

is the cluster reduction method (CRM)18 which opens a way to construct small subspaces

containing solutions of the equations. This method developed and repeatedly applied to the

2

problems of nuclear physics has been employed in the present paper to perform a calculation

of bound state characteristics of a system of four helium atoms. The method allows to obtain

not only the estimations for the binding energy of a four particle system but also the wave

function of the system using computer resources economically. Another important advantage

of CRM is applicability of the method to model-free calculations of multichannel reactions in

a system of four particles15,17,18. Being applied to systems of four helium atoms it can be used
to calculate the reaction rates for He2+He2 → He3 +He and He2 +He2 → He∗

3+He processes.

Calculating s-wave model of He4 tetramer in this paper we make a step towards investigation

of reactions in systems of four atoms on the base of strongly grounded mathematically correct

methods.

This paper contains three additional sections and a conclusion. In section 2 the model

is described and the main equations are given. In the section 3 the method of solution is

presented. Section 4 contains the results of numerical calculations.

II. FORMALISM

The calculations presented here were performed in the framework of diﬀerential

Yakubovsky equations (DYE) for four particles in conﬁguration space. The formalism of dif-

ferential Yakubovsky equations was developed by S.P.Merkuriev and S.L.Yakovlev10. Here

we only give a brief description of these equations touching upon the approximations that

we use and emphasizing the advantages of using the DYE instead of the Shr¨odinger equation

in investigations of bound states of four particles. Detailed and sound description of the

equations and asymptotic boundary conditions can be found in the original paper12 and in

more detail in the book by Merkuriev and Faddeev9.

When considering a system of four particles it is convenient to use Jacobi coordinates.

For identical particles there are two types of Jacobi coordinates, which correspond to diﬀer-

ent partitions of the four particle system into subsystems. The ﬁrst type corresponds to the

partitioning into a three-particle cluster and one separate particle (3+1 type). The second

3

one corresponds to the partitioning into two-particle clusters (2+2 type). The explicit ex-

pressions for the Jacobi coordinates through the particle coordinate vectors rk, k = 1, 2, 3, 4

are given by the formulas

for the ﬁrst type of coordinates and

x2,1 = r2 − r1 ,

y3,21 = (r1 + r2)/2 − r3 ,

z4,321 = (r1 + r2 + r3)/3 − r4 ,

x1,2 = r2 − r1 ,

y3,4 = r4 − r3 ,

z34,12 = (r1 + r2)/2 − (r3 + r4)/2 ,

for the second one. The Jacobi coordinates for partitions of the same type but with diﬀerent

distribution of particles among the clusters can be obtained by cyclic permutations of the

subscripts enumerating the particles in (1) and (2).

Suppose the Hamiltonian of a system of four particles has the form

H = H0 +

V (xα) ,

α
X
where H0 is the Hamiltonian of the system of free particles, α stands for two-particle sub-

systems of the four-body system and V (xα) is the potential of the interaction in the pair

with index α. For the systems of identical particles the wave function Ψ can be expressed

in terms of two Yakubovsky components U k, k=1,2. U 1 corresponds to the partition 3+1

and U 2 corresponds to the partition 2+2. The expression of the total wave function of the

system in terms of Yakubovsky components reads12,18

Ψ = (I + P + + P +P + + P −)(I + P +

4 + P −

4 )U 1+

+(I + P +

1 + P −

1 )(I + P +P +)U 2 .

Here P + (P −) are the operators of cyclic (anticyclic) permutations of four particles, P ±
i

correspond to cyclic permutations of three particles with ﬁxed i-th particle. The Yakubovsky

components U 1 and U 2 satisfy the following set of the equations12:

(H0 + V (x) − E) U 2 + V (x)(P +P +) U 2 =

(5)

= − V (x)(P + + P +

1 )P + U 1 .

Here we have omitted the subsystem index α in the notation of coordinates x since all the

particles are identical. The advantages of using the equations for Yakubovsky components

instead of solving directly the Shr¨odinger equation come from better localization of the in-

teraction in conﬁguration space. In the special case of identical particles the DYE can be

written in term of the interaction potential of only one pair. As a result the numerical

approximation of the Yakubovsky components is a much easier problem than the approxi-

mation of the wave function. Detailed discussion of Yakubovsky equations can be found in

the monograph by Merkuriev and Faddeev9.

We solve the equations for Yakubovsky components in the s-wave approximation in which

the angular momenta of the system of four atoms and all its subsystems are set to zero. The

s-wave equations for Yakubovsky components U k, k=1,2 have the following form9

III. METHOD OF SOLUTION

The diﬀerential equations for the Yakubovsky components (6) are solved using the clus-

ter reduction method (CRM). This method has been developed and applied before15,17,18

to calculate the characteristics of bound states and low-energy scattering of systems of

three and four particles. The cluster reduction method reduces considerably the computa-

tional diﬃculties when solving DYE numerically. In the framework of the CRM Faddeev

(Yakubovsky) components are decomposed in terms of the eigenfunctions of the Hamiltoni-

ans of two (three) particles subsystems. As a result of the projection onto the elements of

a biorthogonal basis we obtain the set of equations corresponding to the relative motion of

clusters. A brief summary of the CRM from Yakovlev and Filikhin18 is given below. The

Yakubovsky components U i, i=1,2 are written in the following form

A biorthogonal basis is required because the Faddeev operator is not self-adjoint16. Sub-

stituting (7) into the Eq. (6) and projecting onto conjugated basis {ψi

The number of equations in the set depends on the number of the terms retained in the

expansion of the Yakubovsky components, Eq. (7). Due to completeness of the set of the

basic functions only a ﬁnite number N of such terms needs to be taken into account to

support a stable numerical solution.

IV. RESULTS

The solution of the Eq. (10) has been computed in the region Ω of the conﬁguration

space deﬁned by the parameters Rx, Ry, Rz:

Ω = {x, y, z : x < Rx, y < Ry, z < Rz}.

The values of these parameters were chosen to be Rx=Ry=Rz=50 ˚A. All the calculations were

performed using model potentials HFDHE27 and HFD-B8. From the one hand according

to contemporary point of view these potentials give lower and upper limits for two-body

binding energies correspondingly, and from another hand some four-body results for these

potential models are known in literature24.

The basic functions φi

l(x, y), ψi

l (x, y), i = 1, 2, l = 1, 2, . . . , N were calculated using

the CRM18. To conﬁrm the accuracy of the basic functions we were checking the basis for

orthogonality using the condition

(hφi

l|ψi

mi − δlm) < 10−3,

i = 1, 2.

The function φ1

1(x, y) for l = 1 and k = 1 in the Eq. (7) is the s-wave Faddeev component

of the ground state wave function of the He3 system (trimer). The binding energy of the

He3 ground state when computed for the HFDHE2 and the HFD-B potentials has the values

-0.105 K and -0.118 K. Compared to the values reported by Carbonell et al.21 and Kolganova

et al.22 our trimer is slightly overbound.

The He4 (tetramer) binding energy, which has been computed using the potentials

HFDHE2 and HFD-B, is given in the Tab. 1.

In the same table we also quote the re-

sult reported by Nakaichi-Maeda and Lim24. These authors used the formalism of integral

AGS equations25. In addition we include the results of the calculations of the mean square

radius (< r2 >1/2) of the system, the mean square distance between Helium atoms, and the

probability of forming the subsystem with cluster structure He3 + He. This last probability

has been computed as

8

P3+1 =< ψ1F1|Ψ >,

(11)

where Ψ is the total wave function of the system, ψ1 is the ground state wave function of

He3 and F1 is the function describing the motion of He3 trimer relative to a single He atom.

As can be seen from the table, the contribution of the He3 + He state to the total wave

function is considerable.

The fast convergence of the cluster decomposition, Eq. (7) indicates the existence of

clusters in subsystems. Particularly, in the 3+1 subsystem one needs to take into account

two terms to get a stable binding energy. The binding energy computed by taking into

account only the 3+1 component has the value -0.25 K, which is in good agreement with

the value -0.24 K by Nakaichi-Maeda and Lim24. To achieve a binding energy calculation

that is stable at the scale 10−2 K one needs to take into account six terms in the Eq. (7)

which use components of both types (3+1) and (2+2).

The analysis of the results of our computation of the characteristics of He3 and He4

systems enables us to draw an analogy with the nuclear cluster systems 3α and 4α. Here

the symbol α denotes a 4He nucleus. The bound states of these systems correspond to

the ground states of nuclei 12C and 16O, respectively. It was known (for example17,26) that

in these cases the three-body systems have no well deﬁned clusters in their subsystems.

However, in the four-body systems the cluster of 3+1 type is dominant i.e.

in this case it

is possible to separate a closely bounded cluster of three particles and fourth particle. The

mean square radius of the nuclear systems 3α (< r2 >1/2=2.33 fm) and 4α (< r2 >1/2=2.54

fm)17 increases with the number of particles. The situation is similar for the system under

consideration. In particular for the potential HFDHE2 (HFDH-B) the mean square radius

of trimer is 6.7 ˚A(6.5 ˚A) and that of the tetramer is 7.4 ˚A(6.9 ˚A) for the same potentials.

To characterize the spatial distribution of the particles constituting the tetramer we

have computed its wave function (4) for the HFDHE2 potential. The density function ρ(r)

is depicted in Fig. 1. normalized with the usual condition

ρ(r)dr = 1.

To study the spatial position of the Helium atoms in the tetramer we have used the total

∞

0
R

9

wave function of the system. For comparison analogous calculations were performed for the

trimer. The He4 (He3) wave function depends on six (three) variables. These are moduli

of the Jacobi coordinates x, y, z (x, y) and cosines of the angles between vectors x, y, z

(x and y) u = (x,y)

xy , v = (x,z)

xz , w = (y,z)

yz . The most probable conﬁgurations of the relative

position of the particles forming the He4 (He3) system was calculated as the coordinates of

the maximum of the square of the total wave function. For He3 system we found x=3.6 ˚A,

y=3.1 ˚A, u=0, and for He4 system x=3.6 ˚A, y=3.1 ˚A, z=2.9 ˚A, u=0, v=0, w=0. These

conﬁgurations are shown in Fig. 2. For the ground state of the trimer the center of the

He atoms masses arrange themselves at the vertices of the equilateral triangle with sides

as large as 3.6 ˚A(Fig. 2. a). For the ground state of the tetramer the three Helium atoms

are located at the vertices of an equilateral triangle with sides as large as 3.6 ˚A, while the

most probable position of the fourth Helium atom is at a distance of 2.9 ˚A in the direction

perpendicular to the plane of the three particle system (Fig. 2. b) and through the center of

the equilateral triangle formed by them. One should not be surprised by the predominance of

the tetrahedron conﬁguration if one takes into consideration the identity of particles and the

s-wave approach that has been used for the description of the tetramer. One can compare the

location of density function maximums with the positions of potential energy minimums.

These positions diﬀer noticeably that demonstrate the essentially quantum nature of the

system. The minimums of potential forms a conﬁguration of equilateral tetrahedron with

the side of 3.0 ˚Awhereas the maximums of density function are located on the vertices of

tetrahedron with the side of 3.6 ˚A.

By applying the method of cluster reduction we have solved numerically the s-wave

diﬀerential equations for the Yakubovsky components for a system with four 4He atoms.

Binding energy, mean-square radius and density function are calculated for the ground

state. The results of the calculations are in good agreement with those of Nakaichi-Maeda

V. CONCLUSION

10

and Lim24, which were performed using the integral equations. The conﬁgurations with He3

cluster and separated helium atom dominates in the He4 cluster. This behavior is analogous

to that of the nuclear 4α particles system17. The most probable spatial conﬁguration of the

four Helium atom system is the tetrahedron with sides as large as 3.6 ˚A.

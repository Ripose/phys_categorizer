Hyperspherical Adiabatic Formalism

Abstract

First, we show that, if there are no bound states, we can express the q.m.

formula involving adiabatic eigenphase shifts. This is for Boltzmann statistics.

From this q.m.

recover, as ¯h goes to 0, the classical expressions for the cluster.

We then discuss diﬃculties which arise in the presence of 2-body bound
states and present a tentative formula involving eigenphase shifts and the 2
and 3 body bound state energies. We emphasize that important diﬃculties
have not been resolved.

when the latter becomes large; we call them bl. The fugacity z equals exp(µ/κT ),
where µ is the Gibbs function per particle, κ is Boltzmann’s constant and T is the
temperature; β = 1/κT . We can then write for the pressure and the density

The fugacity can then be eliminated to give the pressure in terms of the density.

The coeﬃcients of the second and higher powers are called the virial coeﬃcients.

Adiabatic Preliminaries

For the 3 particles of equal masses, in three dimensions, we ﬁrst introduce center of
mass and Jacobi coordinates. We deﬁne

~η = (

)1/2(~r1 −

~r2)

~ξ = (

)1/2(

2
3

~r1 + ~r2

~r3)

2 −

~R =

(~r1 + ~r2 + ~r3)

1
3

where, of course, the ~ri give us the locations of the 3 particles. This is a canonical
transformation and insures that in the kinetic energy there are no cross terms.

The variables ~ξ and ~η are involved separately in the Laplacians and we may
consider them as acting in diﬀerent spaces. We introduce a higher dimensional

vector ~ρ = (

) and express it in a hyperspherical coordinate system (ρ and the set

~ξ
~η

of angles Ω). If we factor a term of ρ5/2 from the solution of the relative Schr¨odinger
equation, i.e. we let ψ = φ/ρ5/2, we are lead to:

Ω is the purely angular part of the Laplacian. We now introduce the adiabatic

basis, which consists of the eigenfunctions of part of the Hamiltonian: the angular
part of the kinetic energy and the potential.

HρBℓ(ρ, Ω) = Λℓ(ρ)Bℓ(ρ, Ω),

where ℓ enumerates the solutions.

Using this adiabatic basis, we can now rewrite the Schr¨odinger equation as a

system of coupled ordinary diﬀerential equations. We write

φ(ρ, Ω) =

Bℓ′(ρ, Ω) ˜φℓ′(ρ)

The ﬁrst δ arises from comparing three interacting particles with three free particles.
The second ¯δ arises when a 3-body system, where only two particles are interacting
(one particle being a spectator), is compared to three free particles.

Classical Limit

The idea behind our WKB treatment of our equations, is to argue that when the
potentials change slowly - within oscillations of the solutions - then the adiabatic
eigenfunctions will also change slowly and we can neglect their derivatives. Thus
we will obtain uncoupled equations with eﬀective potentials (the eigenpotentials
Λℓ(ρ)). We then proceed with these in a more or less conventional WKB fashion.
Let us assume, here, one turning point ρ0.

The phases can now be obtained by considering simpliﬁed forms of the asymp-

totic solutions for the φ′s. Let us denote them as φν. The phases will then be

harmonic of order K). The trace is restricted so as not to involve ρ.

In another key step, we switch to a hyperspherical basis. We note that Λ is related
to (2m/¯h2) V +

Bound States

If there are bound states, the major change in the eigenpotentials is that for some of
these potentials, instead of going to zero at large distances (large ρ), there appears
the eigenpotential (up to some contribution in 1/ρ2),
a negative ‘plateau’.
becomes ﬂat and negative. This is the indication that asymptotically the physical
system consists of a 2-body bound state and a free particle. The eigenpotential may
also ‘support’ one or more 3-body bound states.

The problem is that I can no longer eliminate the ρmax term by subtracting the
contribution of the free particle term; i.e. using the ρmax from T3 to cancel the ρmax
from H3. All is not lost however, as we saw (for example in the terms arising
in the classical limit) that all the terms of the cluster (b3) are needed to obtain a
volume independent and convergent result. The obvious terms to examine are the
ones associated with H2 + T1, which also have amplitudes that correspond to (2-
body) bound states. I have not been able, to date, to prove that all the coeﬃcients
are such that the ﬁnal coeﬃcient of ρmax is zero.

If we were ... to assume that the terms in ρmax do indeed cancel, then we can

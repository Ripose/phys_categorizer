Abstract

We propose large-core correlation-consistent pseudopotential basis sets for

the heavy p-block elements Ga–Kr and In–Xe. The basis sets are of cc-pVTZ

and cc-pVQZ quality, and have been optimized for use with the large-core

(valence-electrons only) Stuttgart-Dresden-Bonn relativistic pseudopotentials.

Validation calculations on a variety of third-row and fourth-row diatomics

suggest them to be comparable in quality to the all-electron cc-pVTZ and

cc-pVQZ basis sets for lighter elements. Especially the SDB-cc-pVQZ basis

set in conjunction with a core polarization potential (CPP) yields excellent

agreement with experiment for compounds of the later heavy p-block elements.

For accurate calculations on Ga (and, to a lesser extent, Ge) compounds, ex-

plicit treatment of 13 valence electrons appears to be desirable, while it seems

inevitable for In compounds. For Ga and Ge, we propose correlation con-

sistent basis sets extended for (3d) correlation. For accurate calculations on

organometallic complexes of interest to homogenous catalysis, we recommend

a combination of the standard cc-pVTZ basis set for ﬁrst- and second-row

elements, the presently derived SDB-cc-pVTZ basis set for heavier p-block el-

ements, and for transition metals, the small-core [6s5p3d] Stuttgart-Dresden

I. INTRODUCTION AND THEORETICAL BACKGROUND

The two major factors that determine the quality of a wavefunction-based electronic

structure calculation are the quality of the one-particle basis set and that of the n-particle

correlation treatment.

Thanks to great progress in electron correlation methods (notably in the area of coupled

cluster theory [1]), the n-particle problem is to a large extent solved, leaving the 1-particle

basis set as the main factor that determines the quality of an electronic structure calculation.

Abundant research has been carried out on basis set convergence and the development

of extended basis sets for ﬁrst- and second-row systems (see e.g. [2] for a review): we note in

particular the ANO (atomic natural orbital [3]) basis sets of Alml¨of and Taylor, the WMR

(Widmark-Malmqvist-Roos, or averaged ANO [4]) basis sets of the eponymous group, and

the correlation consistent (cc) basis sets of Dunning and coworkers [5,6]. Due to their relative

compactness in terms of Gaussian primitives, the cc basis sets have become very popular for

benchmark wavefunction-based ab initio calculations: to a lesser extent, the same holds true

for DFT (density functional theory [7]) calculations.

Basis set convergence of the dynamical correlation energy in conventional electronic struc-

ture calculations is known to be very slow. This is less of an issue for DFT calculations [8–12]:

as a rule basis set convergence appears to be reached for basis sets of spdf quality and cer-

tainly for basis sets of spdf g quality. Standard basis sets of such quality are readily available

for ﬁrst- and second-row compounds: in addition, ANO and WMR basis sets are available for

the ﬁrst-row transition metals [13] and cc basis sets for the third-row main group elements

[14].

Our group has recently become involved in a number of mechanistic studies by means

of DFT methods (e.g. on competitive CC/CH activation by Rh(I) pincer complexes [15,16]

and on Pd(0/II) and Pd(II/IV) catalyzed mechanisms of the Heck reaction [17]) that involve

second-row transition metals and fourth-row main group elements. Generally, one is limited

to basis set/ECP (eﬀective core potential) combinations of approximately valence double-

3

zeta quality.

If one wants to establish basis set convergence for a given property, one is

forced to optimize basis sets ad hoc (as we have done [17]), which is however not necessarily

the most elegant solution. Given that present-day DFT methods are less than ideal for the

treatment of transition states [18–20], calibration calculations using coupled cluster methods

are in order (at least for some small model systems) — and here the basis set issue becomes

even more important.

It is well known that for such heavy elements, relativistic eﬀects cannot gratuitously be ne-

glected without paying a heavy toll in terms of reliability. The theory of relativistic electronic

structure methods has been reviewed in detail by Pyykk¨o [21] and most recently by Reiher

and Hess [22]. For systems in the size range of interest to organometallic chemists, four-

component all-electron relativistic calculations are presently out of the question, and even

quasirelativistic calculations are very costly: consequently, by far the most commonly em-

ployed alternative has been the application of relativistic eﬀective core potentials (RECPs).

A useful ‘fringe beneﬁt’ of the latter is that they reduce the number of electrons that need to

be treated, and hence, indirectly, the overall size of the basis set and cost of the calculation.

The theory and practice of ECPs have been reviewed repeatedly (e.g. [23–25]), most

recently by Dolg [26]. Several ECP families are available for the range of the periodic table

of interest to us, such as the LANL (Los Alamos National Laboratory) ECPs of Hay and

Wadt [27], the CEP (Consistent Eﬀective Potential) family of Stevens, Basch, and coworkers

[28], the Ermler-Christensen family [29], and the Stuttgart-Dresden-Bonn (SDB) energy-

consistent pseudopotentials [30].

The purpose of this paper is to present and validate valence basis sets for RECPs of a

quality comparable to that of the cc-pVTZ and cc-pVQZ correlation-consistent basis sets

for lighter elements, to be used in conjunction with the latter. In selecting the underlying

RECP, we have opted for the SDB pseudopotentials for the following methodological and

pragmatic reasons (some, but not all, of which are satisﬁed for the other popular ECPs):

• compact mathematical form

4

• ready availability in the commonly used quantum chemistry packages Gaussian 98 [31]

and MOLPRO 2000 [32]

• consistent treatment of relativistic eﬀects in all relevant rows of the periodic table

• independence of the ECP on the valence basis set

• availability of core polarization potentials (CPPs) [33], since we were planning to use

‘large core’ potentials for the main group elements

• availability of extended valence basis sets (speciﬁcally, [6s5p3d] contractions) for the

transition metals. In Appendix I, we shall present optimized [2f 1g] polarization func-

tions for those valence basis sets, to be used in conjunction with the presently derived

SDB-cc-pVTZ basis sets for third- and fourth-row elements, and standard cc-pVTZ

basis sets for ﬁrst-and second-row elements.

To our knowledge, the only published example so far of a ‘correlation consistent’ basis set

based on an ECP is the work of Bauschlicher [34], who published cc-pVnZ (n =T,Q,5)

basis sets for indium, optimized for (5s, 5p, 4d) correlation, to be used in conjunction with

a small-core SDB pseudopotential. In this paper and a subsequent application study [35],

benchmark calculations on a number of In compounds were presented that clearly support

the idea that the development of SDB-based correlation consistent basis sets is warranted.

In the next section, we shall describe the procedure by which the valence basis sets were

optimized. In the following section, we shall present validation calculations with these basis

sets on a variety of diatomic molecules. Conclusions are presented in a ﬁnal section.

II. GENERATION OF BASIS SETS

All electronic structure calculations were carried using MOLPRO2000 [32] running on a

Compaq ES40 at the Weizmann Institute of Science. Basis sets were carried out by means of

an adaptation of the DOMIN program by P. Spellucci [36], which is an implementation of the

BFGS (Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno) variable-metric method. Numerical derivatives

5

of order two, four, and six were used: the lower orders until an approximate minimum was

reached, after which the optimization was reﬁned using the higher orders.

For the third-row main group elements, we employed the SDB pseudopotentials denoted

by the SDB group as ECP28MWB [37], i.e.

large-core (1s2s2p3s3p3d) energy-consistent

pseudopotentials obtained from quasirelativistic Wood-Boring [38] calculations. For the

fourth-row main group elements, we employed the ECP46MWB set [37], i.e.

large-core

(1s2s2p3s3p3d4s4p4d).

symmetry and spin eigenfunctions.

Unless indicated otherwise, all Hartree-Fock calculations were carried out using proper

A. Valence sp basis sets

In order to obtain an idea as to the size of the required sp set for the valence orbitals, we

carried out the following numerical experiment for the Se atom: a valence SCF calculation

was carried out using the complete (26s17p) part of the all-electron cc-pV5Z basis set [14]

added to the ECP28MWB pseudopotential. Then all primitives with coeﬃcients below 10−5

were discarded, leaving us with a (16s13p) primitive set at the expense of only 0.38 micro-

hartree in energy. Raising the ‘cutoﬀ’ to 10−4 reduced the primitive set to (13s11p), and

raises the energy by another 3 microhartree. Raising the cutoﬀ by another order of magni-

tude reduces the primitive set to (12s9p), at the expense of an additional 13 microhartree.

Applying the same sequence of cutoﬀs to the (21s16p) primitives in the all-electron cc-pVQZ

basis set leads to (14s11p), (13s9p), and (11s7p), respectively: from the (20s13p) primitives

of the all-electron cc-pVTZ basis set we obtain in the same manner (12s9p) for a 10−4 cutoﬀ,

and (10s7p) for a 10−3 cutoﬀ. Similar patterns were observed for other third-row elements:

the bottom line appears to be that 3–4 more s primitives are required than p primitives.

We subsequently attempted to minimize ((k + 4)skp) basis sets (k=6–10) directly at

the SCF level. However, the Hessian for some of the higher-exponent s functions is ex-

tremely ﬂat, and as a result no reliable optimization can be carried out. Considering the

fact that, for instance, the outer (13s11p) exponents of the all-electron cc-pV5Z basis set

6

display roughly even-tempered sequences ζk = αβk−1 except for the outermost four primitives

of every symmetry, we adopted the compromise solution of optimizing the four outermost

primitives of each symmetry without restriction, but constraining the remainder to follow

an even-tempered sequence. This leads to an optimization problem with twelve parameters

in all (eight independent exponents, plus one α, β pair each for s and p).

In this manner, we were able to obtain (10s6p) through (14s10p) primitive sets. For

Ga, Ge, and As, multiple minima were invariably found, with a solution that exhibits a

‘gap’ between the 3rd and 4th (or 4th and 5th) outermost primitive being marginally lower

in energy than a solution where no such gaps were present. (This behavior is particularly

noticeable for the s primitives.) Carrying out 4-parameter optimizations with purely even-

tempered (14s10p) basis set quickly reveals the cause: as ζ increases, the coeﬃcients are

initially positive, but then decay and change sign as the higher exponent primitives ensure

the proper inner shape of the orbital. The energy is rather insensitive to the location — or

even the presence — of the primitive near the crossing point, and especially with smaller

sets of primitives, a marginal gain in energy might be obtained from a solution with an

additional primitive in the very high exponent region rather than in the ‘crossing’ region.

Since for application in correlated calculations, the presence of a gap in the outer part of

the exponent sequence is clearly undesirable, we have deliberately chosen the most ‘even-

tempered’ solution even where it was not the global minimum.

Similar phenomena were observed for In–I: and likewise, we obtained the most ‘even-

tempered’ primitive valence sets up to (14s10p).

B. Addition of higher angular momentum functions

Parameters for added higher angular momentum functions were then optimized at the

CISD level. At ﬁrst even-tempered sequences of up to four (3d)-type functions were added,

followed by up to three additional (4f )-type functions and up to two additional (5g)-type

functions. For the third-row main group elements, these optimizations progressed unevent-

fully. Not surprisingly, the d exponents diﬀer somewhat from those obtained by Dunning and

7

coworkers for all-electron basis sets: in the latter, the d functions do double-duty as angular

correlation functions for the (4s, 4p) orbitals and as (3d) primitives, while in our case they

solely take on the former role. For the f and g functions, the similarity is greater. In terms

of energetic increments, the familiar ‘correlation consistent’ (2d1f) and (3d2f1g) groupings

of functions with similar energy lowerings emerge.

In the fourth row, the convergence pattern of the d exponents is somewhat peculiar, in

that for instance for Te and I, the energy lowerings for the 2nd and 3rd (3d) function are

similar. This is caused by the rather low-lying (5d) orbital, which also causes a somewhat

peculiar (2d) exponent pattern for Te. We shall return to this point shortly.

C. Deﬁnition of the ﬁnal contracted basis sets

We carried out an analysis similar to that of Dunning and coworkers, in that we for

instance completely contracted the p orbital in a (14s10p4d3f 2g) basis set, then optimized

even-tempered sequences of added p primitives. The optimum s and p exponents revealed

similar trends. In terms of contracting our Se basis set for correlation, however, they un-

equivocally suggest that the 2nd and 4th outermost (s) and (p) primitives be decontracted for

a valence triple zeta basis set, and the 2nd–4th outermost primitives for a valence quadruple

zeta basis set. (From here on, we shall be counting primitives starting from the ‘outermost’,

i.e. smallest and most diﬀuse, exponent.) By comparison, in the Dunning all-electron case

these were the 1st and 3rd, and 1st–3rd primitives, respectively. However, our outermost (sp)

primitives are considerably more diﬀuse than theirs, by virtue of the absence of the inner-

shell ’gravity well’ in the valence-only optimizations. The exponents of the decontracted

primitives in fact are fairly similar.

This having been established, we determined our favored ’VTZ’ and ’VQZ’ contraction

patterns for each element by comparing total energies between all six and four possible

choices, respectively, among the four outermost primitives. If we denote decontraction of

a primitive by a 1 and the lack thereof by a 0, and start at the lowest exponent, then the

favored (i.e., lowest-energy) quadruple-zeta contraction pattern is found to be {0111} for Se,

8

Br, Kr, Te, I, and Xe, but {1101} for Ga, Ge, In, and Sn. (For As, {1011} is marginally

lower in energy than {0111}, while for Sb, a {1110} pattern for the s was combined with

a {1101} pattern for the p functions.) For the triple-zeta contractions, the {0101} pattern

prevails for As, Se, Br, Kr, Te, I, and Xe, but the {0110} pattern for Ga, Ge, In, Sn, and

Sb.

The ﬁnal basis sets for most elements were then obtained simply by adding the optimum

(2d1f) exponents to the ‘triple-zeta’ contraction — leading to a [3s3p2d1f] contracted basis

set —, and the optimum (3d2f1g) exponents to the ‘quadruple-zeta’ contraction — leading

to a [4s4p3d2f1g] contracted basis set. For Te and I, because of the peculiarities of the d

exponents noted above, this procedure does not yield a satisfactory SDB-cc-pVTZ basis set.

By obtaining CISD natural orbitals for Te and I using (3d1f ) primitives, it was revealed that

the highest-exponent primitive contributed appreciably (and similarly) to the lowest two d-

type natural orbitals, but that the latter are mainly distinguished by a sign change in the

lowest-exponent d primitive. Consequently, the two innermost d primitives were contracted

based on their coeﬃcients in the lowest d type natural orbital. The slight added cost should

be well outweighed by the greater reliability. Considering the d-type ANOs in calculations

with (3d1f ) primitives on Sb, Sn, and In revealed that the same procedure might be beneﬁcial

for In, but would not aﬀect Sn or Sb. Therefore, in our ﬁnal SDB-cc-pVTZ basis sets, the d

functions in In, Te, and I are in fact (3d) → [2d] segmented contractions.

The ﬁnal basis sets generated are available on the Internet World Wide Web at the

Uniform Resource Locator http://theochem.weizmann.ac.il/web/papers/SDB-cc.html

in both Gaussian 98 and MOLPRO format.

D. Diﬀuse function exponents

For anionic systems and some very polar compounds, the availability of (diﬀuse-function)

‘augmented’ basis sets, like the original aug-cc-pVnZ basis sets [39], is essential. We have

obtained diﬀuse functions for use with our SDB-cc-pVTZ and SDB-cc-pVQZ basis sets using

the following procedure: (a) one low-exponent s and p function, each, were added to the

9

sp part of the underlying basis set and optimized simultaneously at the SCF level for the

corresponding atomic anion; (b) successive angular momenta of the underlying basis set were

introduced, and one additional low-exponent primitive added and optimized, at the CISD

level for the corresponding atomic anion. The ﬁnal SDB-aug-cc-pVTZ and SDB-aug-cc-

pVQZ basis sets are thus of [4s4p3d2f ] and [5s5p4d3f 2g] quality, respectively.

III. APPLICATION TO DIATOMIC MOLECULES

In order to validate our basis sets, we have carried out CCSD(T) calculations of the

dissociation energy (De), bond length (re), harmonic frequency (ωe) and ﬁrst-order anhar-

monicity (ωexe) of a number of third-row and fourth-row diatomic molecules selected from

the compilation by Huber and Herzberg [40]. CCSD(T) energies were computed at eleven

points spaced evenly at 0.01 ˚A intervals around the experimental re, a ﬁfth-or sixth-order

polynomial in r was ﬁt, and a standard Dunham analysis [41] carried out on the resulting

polynomial. For the open-shell systems and the constituent atoms, the CCSD(T) deﬁnition

according to Ref. [42] was employed throughout.

Since we are using ‘large’ cores, we also carried out calculations using core polarization

potentials (CPPs). For elements of groups IV, V, and VI the parameters were taken from the

work of Igel-Mann et al. [43], although the cutoﬀ parameters given in that reference are not

optimal for the ECPnnMWB pseudopotentials. For group III elements, optimal cutoﬀs were

taken from Leininger et al. [44], while optimal cutoﬀs for the halogens were taken from the

online version of the SDB pseudopotentials [45]. (The valence basis set was left unchanged.)

For systems that include at most third-row atoms, all-electron calculations could be

carried out for comparison using the corresponding standard cc-pVnZ basis sets [5,46,14]. re

and ωe for these species are given in Table I, while De values are given in Tables VII and V.

For the remaining diatomics (which include at least one fourth-row atom), the corresponding

data are found in Tables II and VI, respectively.

In comparing such data with all-electron calculations in which only valence electrons are

correlated, it should be kept in mind that the CPPs approximately account for both inner-

10

shell relaxation/polarization (”static core polarization”) and inner-shell correlation (”dy-

namic core polarization”). Therefore, a direct comparison appears to be somewhat ‘unfair’

to the all-electron calculations; on the other hand, since the standard cc-pVnZ basis sets are

by deﬁnition of minimal basis set quality in the inner-shell orbitals, these basis sets are fairly

limited in terms of ﬂexibility for static polarization. For heavier elements, it should also be

kept in mind that the ECP calculations include relativistic eﬀects at least approximately,

while their all-electron counterparts discussed here are entirely nonrelativistic.

For the late third-row species, it seems to be clear that the performance of our SDB-cc-

pVnZ basis sets is on a par with that of the all-electron basis sets. Introduction of the core

polarization potentials results in a signiﬁcant improvement in the computed bond distance:

agreement between SDB+CPP-cc-pVQZ and experimental bond lengths is particularly good

for many species. This conclusion is less clear for the harmonic frequencies, where the known

tendency [47] of CCSD(T) to slightly overestimate harmonic frequencies may mask any small

improvements. The computed anharmonicities (not reported in Table I) agree very well

between the various methods and experiment.

For the early third-row species, we noticed the at ﬁrst sight peculiar phenomenon (Table

III) that, while our data with CPP are in very good agreement with experiment, the all-

electron bond lengths are considerably too long, e.g. 0.05 ˚A in GeF. (These diﬀerences are too

large to be plausibly ascribed to relativistic eﬀects accounted for by the pseudopotentials.)

The cause lies in the impossibility to make a meaningful separation between ‘valence’ and

(3d) orbitals in these molecules: if correlation from the (3d) orbitals is admitted, a dramatic

improvement is seen in the computed bond distances. Needless to say, such calculations

are vastly more expensive than those with the large-core pseudopotentials, and if the all-

electron basis set would be expanded with the appropriate angular correlation functions for

(3d) correlation (i.e., high-exponent f and g functions), this would further increase the cost

diﬀerential.

As an illustration, we will consider the GaH molecule in somewhat greater detail (Table

IV). The all-electron calculations with standard cc-pVnZ basis sets fortuitously reproduce ωe

11

very well, but overestimate the bond distance by almost 0.03 ˚A. In contrast, 4-electron ECP

calculations with an 28-electron pseudopotential both underestimate ωe and overestimate re.

Admitting (3d) correlation with the cc-pVnZ basis sets leads to a dramatic shortening of

re, but also to severely overestimated ωe and anharmonicity. Obviously, this basis set needs

to be signiﬁcantly extended before it is suitable for (3d) correlation. We have generated

such basis sets, denoted cc-pDVTZ and cc-pDVQZ, in the following manner. All basis func-

tions in the original cc-pVQZ basis set were retained, but four additional d primitives were

decontracted. After this, successive layers of f , g, and ﬁnally h primitives were optimized

at the CISD level (13 electrons correlated) on top of the original basis set. We found that

the ﬁrst h, second g, and third f function yielded similar lowerings of the atomic energy,

and hence added (3f2g1h) primitives to the basis set.

(Exponents and other details can

be found in the Supplementary Material.) Then we restored the original d functions and

progressively uncontracted primitives: while the ﬁrst additional uncontracted d yields a very

large energy lowering, the second adds a 10 millihartree amount comparable to that of the h

functions, while lowerings decay rapidly after that. Hence the ﬁnal cc-pDVQZ basis set is of

[7s6p6d5f3g1h] quality. By similar arguments, we ﬁnd that the cc-pVTZ basis set requires

addition of (2f1g) functions and decontraction of two additional d primitives, leading to a

cc-pDVTZ basis set of [6s5p6d3f1g] quality. (While the f exponents in the cc-pDVQZ basis

set span a continuous range, a ‘gap’ is present in the cc-pVTZ case. A similar phenomenon is

seen in an earlier Ga basis set of Bauschlicher [48].) These basis sets indeed do represent an

improvement (Table IV) but the 14-electron results clearly are still deﬁcient in some respect.

We considered also including (3s3p) correlation: to accommodate this, we uncontracted two

additional s and p primitives each in the cc-pDVTZ basis set, as well as (to ensure adequate

coverage of angular correlation from these orbitals) one additional d function. The resulting

spectroscopic constants are in excellent agreement with experiment, which might lead to the

conclusion that (3s3p) correlation is essential for a proper description of GaH. However, as

we reduce the number of correlated electrons from 22 to 14, we see only quite minor eﬀects

on the spectroscopic constants. At that stage, the additional d function can be removed with

12

essentially no eﬀect on the computed spectroscopic constants; the cc-pDVTZ+2s2p basis set

is thus of [8s7p6d3f 1g] quality. Correlating valence orbitals only leads to re being too long

and ωe too low, conﬁrming that the excellent ωe with standard cc-pVnZ basis sets is indeed

the result of an error compensation.

We now consider the use of small-core ECPs. The eﬀect of reoptimizing exponents was

deemed minimal: instead we simply (a) carried out an ECP10MWB Hartree-Fock calcula-

tion with an uncontracted cc-pVTZ or cc-pVQZ basis set; (b) deleted all primitives with

coeﬃcients×degeneracies that are signiﬁcantly less than 10−4; repeated the SCF calculation

and recontracted the basis set with the orbital coeﬃcients thus obtained. In the cc-pVTZ

basis set, we were able to delete the innermost (5s2p) primitives; in the cc-pVQZ basis set,

the innermost (6s3p) primitives could be deleted. The recontracted basis sets (which are of

[4s4p5d3f1g] and [are again given in the supplementary material. (As given, these basis sets

are of [4s4p5d3f1g] and [5s5p6d5f3g1h] contracted size; to this should be added the additional

decontracted s and p primitives mentioned above, leading to an SDB-cc-pDVTZ+2s2p ba-

sis set of [6s6p5d2f 1g] quality and an SDB-cc-pDVQZ basis set of [8s8p6d5f 3g1h] quality.)

We indeed ﬁnd performance with these basis set-ECP combinations to be quite satisfactory

(Table IV). (Note that for technical reasons, the SDB-cc-pDVQZ results do not include h

functions.)

It should also be noted that the eﬀects of (3d) correlation, while still important in accurate

work, are signiﬁcantly smaller with the cc-pDVTZ+2s2p and cc-pDVQZ+3s3p basis sets than

with their less extended counterparts. The very large core correlation contributions seen in

such studies as Ref. [49] are thus at least in part basis set artefacts.

Results for GeH (Table IV) follow similar trends as those for GaH, although the deviation

from experiment incurred by neglecting (3d) correlation is deﬁnitely smaller. Continuing the

series, our computed results for AsH, SeH, and HBr suggest no need for including (3d)

correlation in these systems.

We also applied the cc-pDVTZ and cc-pDVQZ basis sets to the polar Ga and Ge com-

pounds (Table III). A (sometimes notable) improvement is mainly seen in the vibrational

13

frequencies. Decontracting additional (sp) primitives in the Ga basis set was considered for

GaF, and does not appear to greatly aﬀect results. This parallels a ﬁnding noted earlier [50]

for inner-shell correlation in ﬁrst-row compounds, where ﬂexibility of the core correlation

basis set appears to be more important for A–H than for A–B bonds.

For the fourth-row systems, only a comparison with experiment is possible. Especially

the SDB+CPP-pVQZ results agree very well with experiment, while the errors for the

SDB+CPP-pVTZ basis sets are not dissimilar from those seen for the lighter-atom sys-

tems. A notable exception is constituted by a number of indium compounds, for which

abnormally short bond distances are found. This problem has been noted previously for

large-core pseudopotential calculations on heavy group III halides [51]. We attempted a

number of calculations in which Bauschlicher’s correlation-consistent basis set for In was

used in conjunction with regular cc-pVnZ basis sets on H–Ar and SDB-cc-pVnZ on Ga–Kr

and Sn–Xe. The In (4d) electrons were correlated in these calculations. This completely re-

solves the problem. Discrepancies between all-electron and ECP28MWB basis sets on In are

not inconsistent with the expected magnitude of relativistic eﬀects on re and ωe. For InBr

and InI, consideration of a core polarization potential on the halogen has eﬀects of -0.007

˚A and -0.013 ˚A, respectively, on the bond distance, bringing them into excellent agreement

with experiment. (Note that the +0.005 ˚A discrepancy between computed and observed

re(InCl) found by Bauschlicher [34] with his largest basis set appears to be almost entirely

due to (2s2p) correlation in Cl: its inclusion reduces re by 0.005 ˚A. )

Finally, we shall consider dissociation energies. These are found in Tables V, VII, and VI,

together with experimental data from two sources. These are the 1979 Huber and Herzberg

(HH) book [40], and a more recent compilation by Kerr and Stocker (KS) [52] which contains

data through November 1998.

where the exponent 3.22 is speciﬁc to the VTZ/VQZ basis set combination. This is in fact

a damped variant of the simple A + B/l3 formula of Halkier et al. [55]: the damping is

required [54] because the VTZ and VQZ basis sets are still not extended enough and lead to

overshooting if the A + B/l3 formula is applied to them. (The latter is the extrapolation of

choice for larger basis sets.)

One conspicuous feature of the experimental results is just how uncertain they are for

many molecules in these tables. For the late third-row systems, agreement between exper-

iment and our extrapolated results including CPP is excellent for those molecules where

the experimental value is precisely known. For most of the other systems, the computed

value falls within the combined uncertainties of the experimental values. Agreement in fact

appears to be slightly better than for the all-electron calculations, but this is not an entirely

‘fair’ comparison since the latter include neither inner-shell correlation nor scalar relativistic

corrections, while both are included approximately in the SDB+CPP results through the

core-polarization potential and the relativistic pseudopotential, respectively.

For the Ga, Ge, and In compounds, experimental dissociation energies are so uncertain

that a meaningful comparison is essentially impossible. For those fourth-row systems where

precise experimental data are available, agreement with experiment is still quite satisfactory,

albeit less good than for the third-row compounds.

In particular, an account for higher-

order spin-orbit eﬀects might be mandatory for some of the iodine compounds. Dolg [56]

carried out benchmark calculations on the hydrogen halides and dihalides, and found near-

exact spin-orbit contributions to De(HI) and De(I2) of 0.26 and 0.49 eV, respectively: simply

considering the ﬁne structures of the constituent atoms (as done here) yields 0.315 and 0.63

eV, respectively. In other words, our calculated De values for HI and I2 are intrinsically too

low by 0.07 and 0.14 eV, respectively.

As expected, the use of (diﬀuse function) ‘augmented’ basis sets yields improved results

for re and ωe of highly polar molecules (e.g., GaF); for De values, diﬀerences of up to 0.05

15

eV are seen after extrapolation, which are deﬁnitely signiﬁcant in accurate thermochemical

work. As is the general rule [57,54], the addition of diﬀuse functions considerably improves

the success of extrapolation methods and improves agreement with (precise) experimental

dissociation energies.

Finally, we should address the question whether or not the RECPs used here provide

an approximate account for scalar relativistic eﬀects. Visscher and coworkers studied rel-

ativistic eﬀects on the hydrogen halogenides [58], dihalogenides [59], and interhalogenides

[60] by means of full four-component relativistic CCSD(T) as implemented by Visscher, Lee,

and Dyall [61]. (Pisani and Clementi [62] also carried out Dirac-Fock calculations on the

chalcogen hydrides — including SeH — and found an eﬀect of -0.005 ˚A on re.) Since down

to Br, the eﬀects are fairly small (e.g. +0.003 ˚A and –6 cm−1 in BrF), a comparison be-

tween all-electron and ECP results is somewhat dubious as an indicator for the recovery of

relativistic eﬀects. Given however the sizable relativistic contributions found in that work

for the iodine compounds (e.g. IF: +0.012 ˚A and -23 cm−1), the level of agreement with

experiment found in the present paper is somewhat hard to explain unless the ECPs indeed

recover most of the scalar relativistic eﬀects.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

We have derived (fairly) compact valence basis sets of cc-pVnZ and aug-cc-pVnZ quality

(n=T,Q) for the elements Ga–Kr and In–Xe, to be used in conjunction with large-core

Stuttgart-Dresden-Bonn pseudopotentials. For the third row, the basis sets appear to be

quite comparable to the corresponding all-electron cc-pVnZ basis sets. Agreement with

experiment is quite satisfactory for compounds of the later heavy p-block elements. Highly

accurate calculations on Ga and, to a lesser extent, Ge compounds require treating the

(3d) electrons explicitly: we propose (3d)-correlation basis sets for these elements. For In

compounds, inclusion of (4d) correlation is a must, as previously found by Bauschlicher [34]:

we recommend the basis sets in that reference.

Our principal objective was having extended basis sets available for studies on

16

organometallic compounds, including those with one or more heavy group V, VI, and VII

elements. This objective appears to have been reached.

APPENDIX: F -AND G-FUNCTION EXPONENTS FOR THE TRANSITION

METALS

For use in conjunction with the above SDB-cc-pVTZ basis set on Ga-Kr and In–Xe, and

the standard cc-pVTZ basis set on the ﬁrst two rows of the periodic table, we recommend

the following basis set/ECP combination for transition metals.

For ﬁrst-row transition metals, the pseudopotential denoted as ECP10MDF [63] (which

has a small 10-electron core) was used in conjunction with the [6s5p3d] contraction of an

(8s7p6d) primitive set given in Ref. [63]. For second-and third-row transition metals, we

used the ECP28MWB and ECP60MWB quasirelativistic pseudopotentials, respectively, as

given in Ref. [64], together with the [6s5p3d] contracted valence basis sets given in the same

reference.

17

Two (4f )-type functions and one (5g)-type function were added, and their exponents op-

timized at the CISD level for the lowest-lying (s)1(d)n−1 and (s)2(d)n−2 states. (In addition,

optimizations were carried out for the (s)0(d)10 ground state of Pd.) Proper symmetry and

spin eigenfunctions were used for the Hartree-Fock reference, and only valence electrons were

correlated. The optimum exponents for the two states considered (three in the case of Pd)

are not very diﬀerent: we recommend their averages as the f and g exponents, which are

given in Table VIII.

Calculations are carried out to determine elastic scattering cross sections and resonance energies

for low energy electron impact on uracil and on each of the DNA bases (thymine, cytosine, adenine,

guanine), for isolated molecules in their equilibrium geometry. Our calculations are compared with

available theory and experiment. We also attempt to correlate this information with experimental

dissociation patterns through an analysis of the temporary anion structures that are formed by

electron capture in shape resonances.

INTRODUCTION

Reactions induced by electrons drive nearly all the important chemical processes in radi-

ation chemistry, plasma etching in semiconductors, stability of waste repositories, and are

also fundamental in the dynamics of the atmosphere and interstellar clouds, with processes

such as dissociative recombination and electron attachment.

In recent years, an increasing importance has been recognized to these processes in bio-

logical environments, especially in relation to radiation damage to nucleic acids (DNA and

RNA). These processes consist in the interaction of ionizing radiation (like α, β and γ-rays)

with living tissue, generating possibly mutagenic and carcinogenic byproducts, through a

wide variety of ionization, excitation and energy transfer processes, that can interest many

molecular species in the complex cell environment.

The important work of Sanche and coworkers1,2,3 has shown that damage to nucleic acids

from ionizing radiation4 (single and double strand breaks in particular) can be generated

through a mechanism involving low energy electron attachment to the nucleic acid and sub-

sequent bond breaking due to energy transfer to a vibrational mode of the temporary anion

formed in the electron capture step. These low-energy secondary electrons are generated by

electron-impact ionization caused by high energy electrons, originally produced directly by

the ionizing radiation. In the electron-impact ionization process, the scattered electron loses

part of its kinetic energy, while another electron is ejected, with energy much lower than the

ﬁrst one.

In the past few years many studies have been devoted to understanding the mechanism

for the action of the low-energy electrons and their capability to cause strand breaks.5,6,7,8,9

A ﬁrst general feature on which there is wide agreement is that the electron capture is mainly

2

due to the DNA and RNA bases. These molecules have extended aromatic systems, therefore

there is a wide range of low-lying unoccupied π∗ orbitals where an electron can be captured,

giving rise to a shape resonance, a temporary anion, in the range of energies between 0 and

15 eV, where the experiments have found signatures of electron-induced damage to nucleic

acids.

The simplest of these bases are thymine, cytosine, uracil (pyrimidines, monocyclic) and

adenine and guanine (purines, bicyclic and generally larger than pyrimidines). Their struc-

tures are shown in Fig. 1.

In this paper we will present theoretical predictions of cross

sections for elastic electron scattering from these large molecules. Determination of the

location, width, and electronic structure of resonances for a single target molecule is an im-

portant step towards understanding and possibly modeling the complex dynamics of DNA,

which consists of multiple components. Speciﬁcally, besides the bases, there are also the

sugar backbone, the phosphates, and also the solvation water,10 that probably plays a ma-

jor role in stabilizing the temporary anions.11,12 No previous theoretical or experimental

study of low-energy electron scattering from all DNA bases is available for comparison (al-

though a study at intermediate energy has been carried out recently4), but our method has

proven its reliability in the study of small molecules13 and more extended systems like C60,

SF6 and XeF6.14

Much experimental work also has been carried out on dissociative electron attachment

from DNA bases,8,15,16 to understand what fragments are generated. We will discuss the

possible connections with measured dissociation branching ratios that we can infer from the

examination of the spatial shape and nodal surfaces of the resonant wavefunctions.

II. THEORY

A detailed description of our method is available in Ref. 13. For this reason we will only

review here the main points and the changes we have implemented since that work, notably

a new polarization-correlation potential17 which permits enhanced predictive capabilities.

The interaction between the N electrons in a molecule and the scattered electron is a

many body problem that can be recast,18 using the so called static exchange approximation,

into a one body problem for the continuum electron with a nonlocal potential:13

N

φki(~r)

| ~r − ~r′ |

Xi,j

Xk=1

(1)

here Vs is the electrostatic potential, φ0 is the scattered electron orbital, while the other

orbitals refer to target electrons, and the ci are conﬁguration interaction (CI) coeﬃcients.

In this approximation only one state for the target is considered (the ground state), whereby

it is only suitable to describe electronically-elastic processes. The nonlocal interaction con-

sists of three main pieces: the direct electrostatic contribution, the exchange term and the

polarization-correlation potential. Of these three, only the ﬁrst is a local potential.

To describe electron scattering from a general, possibly very complicated molecule, we use

the R-matrix method,19 which partitions space into two regions: an internal region within

which all the short-range physics is conﬁned and an outer region where only long-range

interactions (like Coulomb or dipole potentials) are important. Our calculation begins from

a variational principle19 for the logarithmic derivative of the wave function at the boundary

between the two regions

∂r

V Ψ∗(E − ˆH − ˆL)ΨdV
V Ψ∗δ(r − r0)ΨdV
R

4

(2)

where ˆL is the Bloch operator,13 and ro is the boundary between the internal and external

regions. It is possible, after expanding the internal region wavefunction in a suitable basis

set, to recast the solution of Eq. 2 as an eigenvalue problem:

Γ ~C = (E − H − L) ~C = Λ ~Cb.

(3)

The external region is then treated matching the solution of Eq. 3 to the exact wave-

functions for the long-range tail of the molecular potential. We show in Sec. II C how the

contribution from a long range dipole ﬁeld can be included in our method. The basis set we

use for the internal region of the R-matrix is a product of ﬁnite element cubic polynomials

in all three dimensions, using a grid in spherical coordinates.

A. Local Density Approximation (LDA)

To simplify further the description of our system we have to deal with the nonlocality

inherently present in the potential. To do this we use a local density approximation for the

exchange potential, which reduces it to a functional only of the local density:

where kF is the local Fermi momentum:

Vex(~r) = −

kF F (kF , E),

kF (~r) = (3π2ρ(~r))1/3

2
π

5

and F is a functional of the energy and the local density ρ(~r) (through the local Fermi

momentum). The functional form we use for F is called the Hara exchange.20 It has been

(4)

(5)

extensively employed in continuum state calculations, and it is energy-dependent. The local

exchange approximation, widely used also in density functional calculations,21 has proven

itself to give qualitatively correct results,13,18 while being suﬃciently simple to implement

computationally that it permits an exploration of complex molecular species.

B. DFT Polarization potential

We have recently added to our computer code the capability to use a parameter free

correlation-polarization potential,22,23 based on density functional theory (DFT) ideas. As

shown in Ref.

24 the polarization-correlation contribution is physically related to the

distortion-relaxation eﬀect on the molecule generated by the incoming electron. This is

extremely important for an accurate description of the scattering process. The long range

part of this potential is a simple multipole expansion, of which we retain only the induced

dipole polarization terms:

Vpol = −

1
2r4 (α0 + α2P2(cos θ))

(6)

where α0 and α2 are the totally symmetric and nontotally symmetric components of the

polarizability tensor, and are calculated ab initio using electronic structure codes.

In the volume where the electronic density of the target is not negligible, this potential is

nonlocal. The interaction can be approximated again as a local potential, diﬀerent forms of

which have been suggested in the literature. The one we use is based on DFT (speciﬁcally

on the LYP potential of Ref. 17) and it has yielded reliable results in the work of Gianturco

and coworkers.25 This form makes use of the electron density, its gradient and laplacian,

which have to be calculated for each target molecule. The short and long range potentials

are matched unambiguously at the innermost crossing point, whose radius is dependent on

6

the angles.

C. Dipole physics

Since the molecules we considered in this work have large electric dipole moments, there

is a need to consider the long range eﬀect of the dipole ﬁeld on the scattered electron. Two

possible options might be considered, either extending the boundary of the R-matrix box

far out to a region where the dipole potential is very small, which would be extremely time-

consuming for our calculations, or matching to outer region functions adapted to the dipole

interaction. We choose this second route and, following the example of Clark,26 we deﬁne

the matrix of the operator:

(l2 − 2D cos θ)ΩN = N(N + 1)ΩN

(7)

where l is the angular momentum operator, θ is the angle between the incoming electron

and the dipole direction, D is the dipole moment, N(N + 1) and ΩN are eigenvalues and

eigenfunctions. We expand ΩN in a basis of spherical harmonics to diagonalize the system

in Eq. 7. The order of the spherical Bessel functions that are matched in the outer region

will be now N (not an integer, in general) rather than the usual orbital angular momentum

quantum number l. Since the dipole moments of the molecules in question are very large,

the dipole plus centrifugal potential becomes attractive for the ﬁrst few channels which may

thus have a complex N. In such cases we deﬁne N = −1/2 + iµ and the matching functions

will become:26

¯nN (kr) = −

Re(Jiµ(kr))

π
2r

1

r

2πµ

(9)

where Jiµ is a cylindrical Bessel function. This allows us to keep the functions in Eq. 8

always real, and therefore have real K-matrices.

It should be mentioned, however, that at extremely low energies these functions oscillate

rapidly in energy as sin(µ log kr), giving rise to K-matrices that are not smooth functions

of energy. Deﬁning the base pair as in Ref. 27 solves the problem, but since we are not

interested in energies below about 0.5 eV in this study, the functions in Eqs. 8-9 will be

suﬃcient.

The dipole plus centrifugal potential is attractive if the value of the dipole moment is

larger than a critical value (Dc=1.625 Debye for a nonrotating dipole).

In this case the

dipole interaction can bind the electron all by itself. In general, when rotation is included,

the critical value of the dipole moment to have a bound state is around28 2-2.5 D and the

number of dipole-bound states is ﬁnite. In the case of uracil,7,11,29 such a dipole-bound state

exists at roughly 0.1 eV below the neutral ground state energy, at the equilibrium geometry

of the target molecule.

D. Calculation details

To calculate the target properties we have used the GAUSSIAN 98 program suite, at

the Hartree-Fock (HF) level of theory. We have noticed in the past13 that CI calculations

are in this case much more expensive and make comparatively little diﬀerence in the ﬁnal

cross sections. All of the molecules we treat here are spin singlets in their ground state. For

the scattering calculations we have used an IBM Power 4 supercomputer, each calculation

taking about 6 wall clock hours on 16 processors working in parallel. The size of the matrices

8

generated is about 180000 by 180000 and the direct solution of the linear system requires

about 10 minutes per energy point when distributed over 16 processors. The matrices are

very sparse (fewer than 0.5% nonzero elements), and we use a direct sparse factorization

method to solve the linear system. The convergence of the calculation is such that incre-

menting the number of sectors by 30% lowers the energy of the resonances by a further 0.1

eV in uracil; since it is already quite cumbersome to carry out these calculations we deemed

this level of convergence as suﬃcient for the purposes of this study. The geometry of the

molecules is chosen to be the equilibrium target geometry, optimized at the HF level with a

6-31G* basis set.

III. RESULTS

To our knowledge there are no available experimental data or calculations of low energy

electron scattering from the complete set of DNA bases. A study of electron attachment

has been presented in Ref. 9 and the resonance positions are clearly marked. Compared

to these results, our calculations show resonances shifted typically by about 2 eV higher in

energy, but the energy spacing of the resonances is comparable to what is observed in the

experiment.Moreover the relative values of the widths of successive resonances resemble the

measured widths. There is also a theoretical study at intermediate energies,4 and calculations

for scattering from uracil;12,30 in the following we compare these results to ours.

We have already mentioned that the heterocyclic DNA bases have many low-lying unoc-

cupied orbitals, so it is not surprising that their elastic cross sections for electron scattering

exhibit many shape resonances. These may be viewed as a capture of the scattered electron

into one of these antibonding orbitals to form a short lived negative ion state.31,32

Since all these molecules have, in their equilibrium conﬁguration, only one symmetry

9

element - reﬂection through the molecular plane - we will characterize the resonances as

being of σ type (no node in the plane) or π type (when they have instead a node in the

plane) rather than using the A′ and A′′ labels as is customary for the Cs group.

A. Positions and widths of resonances

A general comparison of partial elastic cross sections for all ﬁve of these molecules is

shown in Fig. 2, while in the following we give a more detailed description and compare

with information available in the literature. Also, a plot of total time-delays (see also Sec.

III B for details) is provided in Fig. 3 to show the resonances is more detail.

Since we are dealing with polar molecules, applying the ﬁxed-nuclei approximation as

it stands makes the partial wave expansion of the forward scattering amplitude divergent.

Due to the long-range nature of the dipole interaction, in fact, all partial waves would

contribute to the scattering process, causing an inﬁnite scattering in the forward direction

and therefore inﬁnite integral cross sections. There is a method, extensively discussed in the

literature,33,34 to deal with this problem by means of a Born closure formula, which yields

a ﬁnite integral cross section once molecular rotations are included. We will not pursue

this further, since existing experiments are not likely to deal with such detailed rotational

structures. Therefore our cross sections and time-delays include only up to lmax = 10

and omit all higher partial waves. The correction would be proportional to the dipole

moment and inversely proportional to the smallest rotational spacing. For the DNA bases

the dipole moment is large, while the rotational spacing is small. Therefore the correction

can be quite large especially at very low energy. The correction would thus tend to mask

the resonant structures, which are the most interesting observables and which have been

measured in experiments. All of the calculated cross sections grow rapidly when the incident

10

electron energy decreases below 1 eV, which is a signature of the role played by the dipole

ﬁeld in pulling in the electron and which is very common in electron scattering from polar

molecules.9,35

A comparison o four resonance patterns with the electron transmission spectroscopy

(ETS) data of Burrow and coworkers7,9 can be found in Figs. 10-12, where the time-delay

data from our calculations has been rescaled by an overall constant and shifted down in

energy to facilitate the comparison of energies, widths and spacing. All of the resonances

obtained in our calculations are listed in Table I.

1. Uracil

(64%).

In the cross section of uracil we ﬁnd 3 resonances, at 2.16 eV (of width 0.2 eV), at 5.16

(0.6 eV wide) and a very broad resonance at 7.8 eV. The resonance at 2.16 eV is dominated

by the l = 3 partial wave (50%) and has contributions from l = 1 (35%) and l = 2 (11%).

at 5.16 eV the main partial wave is d (66%), at 7.8 eV f-wave is the dominant contribution

In the work of Gianturco et al. (see Ref. 30) three π∗ resonances are found at energies of

2.2, 3.5 and 6.5 eV. The second and third π∗ resonances from that work fall at lower energies

than ours, a somewhat surprising discrepancy since the theoretical models are very similar.

The contribution of the dipole ﬁeld at distances larger than 12 Bohr is neglected in Ref.

30, but we have noticed that this inﬂuences only the overall magnitude of the cross sections

(roughly an increase of 20% at very low energy, that is reduced to about 5% around 10eV),

the dipole physics only weakly aﬀects the resonance positions and widths.

Resonances are measured Ref. 9 to occur at 0.3, 1.5 and 3.8 eV. They are all assigned

as π resonances,7 so our results should be shifted by about 2 eV down, whereas the spacing

11

between the resonances is larger than experiment. The relative resonance widths are similar

to Ref. 7, in that the ﬁrst resonance is very narrow, the second broader and the third very

broad, a comparison is shown in Fig. 10, where an integration of the experimental data has

been performed to show more clearly the resonance positions and widths.

For cytosine we ﬁnd 3 main resonances, a very sharp one at 1.7 eV (width 0.5 eV), then at

4.3 eV (width 0.7 eV) and a third at 8.1 eV (width 0.8 eV). The dominant angular momentum

character of the resonances is the same as for the three corresponding resonances of uracil.

Comparing the resonance positions with the data of Ref. 9 we see the same general trend

already observed with uracil, of an overall shift higher than experiment of all resonances by

about 2 eV. Interestingly, the ﬁrst two resonances are measured to occur at an energy lower

than in uracil, a trend that we verify in our calculations.

The scattering cross section for thymine is closely similar to uracil, which is not surprising

in view of their close structural similarities, this applies to both the magnitude and the

position of the resonances, which are slightly shifted to higher energies. Speciﬁcally, we ﬁnd

resonances at 2.4 eV (width 0.2 eV) at 5.5 eV (width 0.6 eV) and at 7.9 eV (width 1 eV).

The electron scattering spectrum for adenine presents many resonances, due to the com-

plexity of the target structure, as expected. Also very interesting is the fact that the cross

12

2. Cytosine

3. Thymine

4. Adenine

section drops sharply at energies below 2 eV, a behavior opposite to that found for the other

molecules, if we do not consider the dipole physics outside the R-matrix box, whereas a

zero-energy peak appears in the full calculation, a possible sign of a dipole bound state right

below threshold.

The ﬁrst resonance occurs at 2.4 eV (width 0.2 eV), the second at 3.2 eV (sharp, width

0.2 eV), then another centered at 4.4 eV (0.3 eV wide), while at 9 eV we have a broader

resonance of width 0.5 eV. The dominant partial wave of the ﬁrst two resonances is l = 2

(65% and 62% respectively). The third resonance is l = 3 at 51% and l = 4 at 33% The

resonance at 9 eV is dominantly l = 5 (53%) with an l = 3 contribution (22%).

Compared to experiment we have a shift of all resonances roughly 1.5 eV higher, as in

guanine, in this case the spacings are correct (about 1 eV between the ﬁrst three resonances,

while the fourth falls too high in energy and it is not measured in experiment). Also

the experimental widths of the ﬁrst three resonances are very similar, as in our data. A

comparison with the data of Ref. 9 is shown in Fig. 11.

5. Guanine

For guanine we ﬁnd 4 resonances: at 2.4 eV (width 0.2 eV), at 3.8 eV (width 0.25eV), a

third at 4.8 eV (width 0.35 eV), then at 8.9 eV (width 0.6 eV) and a broad resonance around

12 eV. Each of the ﬁrst three resonances has strong contributions from d, f, and g-waves.

At 2.4 eV the contributions are 46% for l = 2 and 37% for l = 3, for the second resonance

l = 2 is 44% while l = 4 is 32%, the third is 38% of l = 4 character and 35% of l = 3. The

resonance at 8.9 eV is 33% h-wave, 28% f-wave and 20% g-wave. At 12 eV the composition

is: l = 4 and l = 5 equally at 23%, while l = 6 contributes a further 13%.

Comparison to experimental data (see Fig. 12) shows again a shift of 1.5 eV overall,

13

while the resonance spacing is well reproduced, and the second and third resonances fall at

higher energies with respect to adenine, as in our calculations. Also the widths seem close

to experiment.

B. Resonance molecular structures

From the shapes and nodal structures of the resonant states it is possible to attempt a

discussion of the dissociation patterns observed experimentally, if we consider the resonant

states as being precursors for dissociative states. Caution must be used, though, in drawing

conclusions from this analysis, because this involves a certain degree of speculation.

In

fact, to establish once and for all the dissociation patterns of these complicated systems,

scattering calculations at many diﬀerent geometries would have to be carried out, and the

nuclear dynamics should be included, At present this is computationally too expensive to

contemplate. The ﬁrst two resonances observed for uracil are shown in Figs. 4 and 5. The

quantity plotted is a projection on the molecular plane of the eigenvector corresponding to

the maximum eigenvalue of the time-delay matrix19

Q = iS

dS†
dE

,

(10)

where S is the scattering matrix. At the energy where the time delay of the resonance is a

maximum, this eigenvector constitutes the dominant contribution to the resonant structure,

since it corresponds to the partial wave that experiences the maximum time delay in the

scattering process. For suﬃciently narrow resonances one eigenvalue is always dominant,

making the resonance analysis much easier. The eigenvectors of the time-delay matrix are

complex, so we adopt a phase factor such that the highest peak of the wavefunction is a

14

purely real number. We then ﬁnd that the resonance wavefunction is real everywhere, to

a good approximation (the imaginary part is about 10−6 smaller than the value of the real

part), and we plot only the real part. We analyze in detail only the cases of uracil and

adenine, the other pyrimidines being very similar to the former and guanine to the latter.

The nodal patterns for uracil are very similar to the ones showed in Ref. 30, which is

not surprising since the approximations made in that work are similar to ours, as already

discussed, therefore we show only the ﬁrst two resonances. Incidentally, we notice the close

resemblance of these resonant wavefunctions to the ﬁrst virtual orbitals of uracil from a HF

calculation performed with a small basis set (6-31G*), see for example Fig. 6. In Ref. 30 also

a very low σ∗ resonance is found at 0.012 eV. Our cross section grows substantially at low

energy. If we plot the eigenstate corresponding to the largest eigenvalue of the time-delay

matrix (as described in Sec. III B), as in Fig. 4, corresponding to this low energy range, it

looks similar to Fig. 5 in Ref. 30, with the main diﬀerences being that in our wavefunction

the N3-H bond has a node, there is a large excess charge on N3 and on the oxygen attached

to C4, while another nodal surface cuts diagonally from C2 to C5. This resonance anyway

does not appear to be so relevant in the experimental data,7 where mainly the π∗ resonances

are detected.

We can also see that there is accumulation of electronic density (the peaks of the wave-

function) on the ring structure, and that many of the ring bonds have nodal surfaces cutting

through them, so capture in these resonant states can be reasonably thought as leading to

a fragmentation of the molecule in which the aromatic ring is broken. Experimental disso-

ciation patterns are illustrated for Br-uracil in Ref. 15, where evidence for breaking of the

ring structure lies in the peaks at 1.6 and 3.5 eV produced by (OCN)− and other fragments.

These fragments can be generated by capture into shape resonances, appearing in our cal-

15

culations at 2.2, 5.2 and 7.8 eV respectively. In particular there is a nodal surface in the 5.2

eV resonance that encloses the C4-N3 bond, which could generate a CN− fragment.

Since our calculations do not take into account core-excited states or vibrations, our

results do not include any Feshbach resonant structures. These appear to cause at least some

of the patterns observed in experiment, as in the case of uracil,7 and they will presumably

constitute the dominant trapping pathways for energies higher than 7 eV, where the number

of electronic Feshbach resonances starts to become very large.14

In the case of uracil, we looked carefully for a σ∗ resonance that might be similar to the

state shown in Fig. 3 of Ref. 7 around 3 eV at equilibrium geometry, a dissociative state most

likely responsible for N1-H bond cleavage. The Ref. 7 calculation was performed by scaling

Hartree-Fock continuum orbital energies, so no information about the width was provided.

Such a state, taking into account an expected shift of 2-3 eV upward in our calculations,

should have appeared at around 6-7 eV, and it was not found. This is probably due to the

fact that this resonance is extremely broad, since it is also not seen even in experiment.7

Moreover in calculations carried out using complex absorbing potentials, in connection with

Green’s function methods,36,37 for similar systems (like benzene38), analogous σ resonances

were extremely hard to detect. They became narrower (around 1eV width at equilibrium)

only when the relevant hydrogen was substituted with a heavy atom like chlorine; this was

also demonstrated experimentally in the case of Cl-uracil in Ref. 7.

For adenine there is less experimental information available to compare. In Ref. 16 it is

stated that the dominant breakup channel for low energy (0-4eV) electron attachment leads

to hydrogen atom loss, and very prominent resonant structures are present in the range 1

to 3 eV. If we look at the resonance wavefunction maps in Fig. 7-9 we can see that there

is no signiﬁcant buildup of electronic density on any of the hydrogens, consistently with the

16

fact that the negative charge stays on the molecular frame, and therefore there is no H−

formation.

The ﬁrst few unoccupied molecular orbitals that can be obtained from a Hartree-Fock

calculation for adenine, as in the case of uracil, are extremely similar in their nodal structures

to our resonant wavefunctions, so these shape resonances can be viewed quite reasonably as

the trapping of the scattered electron in a virtual orbital.

Most of the C-C and C-N bonds have nodal surfaces passing through them, This might

suggest that other channels that involve the breakup of C-C and C-N bonds could also be

available at these energies, although probably they are less important than the hydrogen

loss products.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

We have presented results for electron scattering from DNA and RNA bases. In showing

some of their resonant wavefunctions, we have attempted to link the molecular breakup

patterns and products to the structure of the nodal surfaces of these wavefunctions. The

results for cross sections and resonances show an overall shift of about 1.5-2 eV higher for all

the resonances in our calculations, compared to experiment, we believe that this shift is due

to the approximate nature of our model. Apart from this, though, we seem to reproduce

trends observed in experiment, with respect to the resonance spacing, their widths and

also in relative positions for diﬀerent molecules, which gives us guarded conﬁdence in our

results. We have presented the ﬁrst calculations of cross sections for all the main DNA bases,

and discussed the relationship of our results to experimental data. Ample room exists for

improvement in our model, and it will be desirable to eventually calculate resonant surfaces,

and not just equilibrium values, in order to characterize the dissociation processes. Work is

17

presently underway to meet some of these challenges.

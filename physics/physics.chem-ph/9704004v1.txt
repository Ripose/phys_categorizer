Estimators Πn for the correlation energy can be computed as roots of
eﬀective characteristic polynomials of degree n. The coeﬃcients of these
polynomials are derived from the terms of the perturbation series of the
energy. From a fourth-order Møller-Plesset (MP4) calculation one can
calculate with negligible eﬀort a size-extensive estimator Π2 that is in
many cases much closer to the full CI correlation energy of the ground
state than the MP4 value. [H.H.H. Homeier, J. Mol. Struct. (Theochem)
366, 161 (1996)] Here, we prove that the estimators Πn for n > 2 are
size-extensive if they are calculated from the MP series.

1 Introduction

Many-body perturbation theory is a convenient tool to estimate the correla-
tion energy of molecular systems. Usually, one calculates an estimate for the
correlation energy by term-by-term summation of the Møller-Plesset (MP)
series

E = E0 + E1 + E2 + E3 + E4 + E5 + . . . ,

that is usually denoted by MPn. But this approximate value does not opti-
mally exploit the information content of the terms Ej of the MP series. Better
estimates can be obtained by using convergence acceleration or extrapolation
methods to sum the perturbation series, as for instance Pad´e approximants or
methods based on eﬀective characteristic polynomials. The method of eﬀec-
tive characteristic polynomials has been introduced by ˇC´ıˇzek and coworkers
recently. It has been applied to the summation of the divergent perturba-
tion series of anharmonic oscillators [1] and to correlation energies of model
systems [2–8]. Extensions of the method for the simultaneous treatment of
several perturbation series have recently been proposed [9] but this will not
be considered in the following.

If only perturbation energies up to the fourth order are available then one can
use the Π2 estimator [10]. The Π2 estimator is obtained as a root of a second-
degree eﬀective characteristic polynomial. The coeﬃcients of this polynomial
are related to the terms of the perturbation series. The Π2 estimator can
be calculated easily from the terms E0, . . . , E4 of the MP series and is size-
extensive. As is well-known, the latter property is important for the treatment
of larger systems. For a series of benchmark systems the Π2 estimator proved
to be relatively accurate as compared to a number of other estimators [10].

Analogous estimators Πn can be derived from eﬀective characteristic polyno-
mials of higher degrees n. In the present contribution, we sketch the method
of eﬀective characteristic polynomials, basically to ﬁx notation. Then, it is
proved that the estimators Πn for n > 2 are also size-extensive if the under-
lying perturbation theory is size-extensive, as is the case for the MP series.

2 Correlation energy estimators based on eﬀective characteristic

polynomials

In this section, we sketch the method of the eﬀective characteristic polynomi-
als. The characteristic polynomial Pn(E) of degree n in the unknown energy
E has in the linear variation method the form

Pn(E) = det |hφj|H|φki − E δj,k|

(3)

where {φj}n
j=1 are n orthonormal basis functions, and H is the Hamiltonian.
If the Hamiltonian can be written as H = H0 + βV , the polynomial has the
form ([1], Eq. (3.2))

with fn,n,0 = 1. This leaves L + 1 coeﬃcients fn,j,k to be determined where
L = n(n + 3)/2 − 1. In the method of the characteristic polynomial, they are
obtained from the coeﬃcients Ej of the perturbation series for E

Pn(E) =

Ej

fn,j,kβk

Xj=0

Since Pn(E) = 0 for an eigenvalue E, one demands

Pn(E0 + βE1 + β2E2 + . . .) = O(βL+1) .

This means that the ﬁrst L + 1 coeﬃents of the Taylor series (in β) of the
left-hand side of this equation, i.e. up to the coeﬃcient of βL, all have to van-
ish. This yields a linear equation system for the unknown fn,j,k. We assume in
the following that this linear equation system yields a unique solution for the
coeﬃcients fn,j,k. After the determination of the coeﬃcients, the eﬀective char-
acteristic polynomial is ﬁxed and also denoted by Pn(E) = Pn[E0, . . . , EL](E)
in order to make the dependence on the terms Ej explicit. The eﬀective charac-
teristic equation Pn[E0, . . . , EL](E) = 0 may then be solved for E. The lowest
root is called Πn[E0, . . . , EL] or, more simply, Πn, if the values of the Ej are
plain from the context.

In the case n = 2 one obtains for β = 1 the simple expression

3 Proof of the size-extensitivity

Consider a supersystem composed of M identical, non-interacting subsystems.
Then, the true energy of the supersystem is the M-fold of the energy of a single

3

subsystem. An approximate method for the computation of the energy is called
size-extensive if the approximate energy for the supersystem is the M-fold of
the approximate energy of a single subsystem.

It is well-known that MP perturbation theory is size-extensive order by order.
This means that for all k ≥ 0 the k-th order term of the perturbation series
for the supersystem equals M Ek if the k-th order term of the perturbation
series of a single subsystem is Ek. This implies that the MPk estimator is
size-extensive for each order k.

In order to prove size-extensitivity of the Πn estimators with n > 2, one thus
has to show that for each n and M the equation

Πn[M E0, . . . , M EL] = M Πn[E0, . . . , EL]

(8)

holds where, as before, L = n(n + 3)/2 − 1.

For given M and n and for given E0, . . . , EL and β, we can consider the fn,j,k
and hence, also the eﬀective characteristic polynomial

Pn[E0, . . . , EL](E) =

Ej

fn,j,kβk

as known. We introduce a new polynomial by

˜Pn(E) = M n Pn[E0, . . . , EL](E/M)
n−j

n

=

Ej

[fn,j,kM n−j]βk .

Xj=0

Xk=0

Eq. (10) deﬁnes the polynomial, while Eq. (11) shows that ˜Pn(E) can also
be regarded as an eﬀective characteristic polynomial with new coeﬃcients
˜fn,j,k = fn,j,kM n−j. Note that ˜fn,n,0 = 1 holds as required.

Since

˜Pn (M E0 + β M E1 + β2M E2 + . . .)
= M n Pn[E0, . . . , EL](E0 + β E1 + β2E2 + . . .)
= O(βL+1) ,

the polynomial ˜Pn(E) is identical to the eﬀective characteristic polynomial for
the energies M E0, . . . , M EL, i.e.

M n Pn[E0, . . . , EL](E/M) = Pn[M E0, . . . , M EL](E) .

Thus, the complete pattern of roots is scaled by M, since if ǫ is any root
of Pn[E0, . . . , EL](E) then M ǫ is a root of Pn[M E0, . . . , M EL](E). But this
proves Eq. (8) since Πn[E0, . . . , EL] is a root of Pn[E0, . . . , EL](E).

4 Concluding Remarks

Size-extensitivity is an important property that is helpful for obtaining reli-
able energy estimates for larger systems. It is hoped that correlation energy
estimates on the basis of eﬀective characteristic polynomials become more
widespread since they oﬀer a conceptually and computationally relatively sim-
ple but accurate computational tool as demonstrated in [10]. Only the MP
series has to be computed, and its terms be combined to obtain an eﬀective
characteristic polynomial and the correlation energy as one of its roots as in
Eq. (7). Some error control is possible by comparison to some other methods
for convergence acceleration of the perturbation series [10].

An extension of the method was proposed by the author in [9]. It allows to
combine information from the terms of several short perturbation expansions
for a small number of states. These simultaneous perturbation series can also
be used for the construction of a characteristic polynomial. In this way, the
somewhat demanding relation between the degree of the characteristic polyno-
mial and the maximal order of the perturbation calculation is largely avoided.
Applications of this extended method and a proof of its size-extensitivity are
currently under investigation.

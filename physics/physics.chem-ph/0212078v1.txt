Molecular Alignment and Orientation:
From Laser-Induced Mechanisms to Optimal Control

Osman Atabek and Claude M. Dion

Abstract. Genetic algorithms, as implemented in optimal control strategies,
are currently successfully exploited in a wide range of problems in molecular
physics.
In this context, laser control of molecular alignment and orienta-
tion remains a very promising issue with challenging applications extending
from chemical reactivity to nanoscale design. We emphasize the complemen-
tarity between basic quantum mechanisms monitoring alignment/orientation
processes and optimal control scenarios. More explicitly, if on one hand we can
help the optimal control scheme to take advantage of such mechanisms by ap-
propriately building the targets and delineating the parameter sampling space,
on the other hand we expect to learn, from optimal control results, some robust
and physically sound dynamical mechanisms. One of the basic mechanisms for
alignment (i.e., molecular axis parallel to ﬁeld polarization) is related to the
pendular states accommodated by the molecule-plus-ﬁeld eﬀective potential.
The laser control of alignment can be reached by an adiabatic transport of an
initial isotropic rotational state on some pendular state trapping the molecule
in well-aligned geometries. Symmetry breaking mechanisms are to be looked
for when orientation (i.e., molecular axis in the same direction as ﬁeld polar-
ization) is the goal of laser control. Two mechanisms are considered. The ﬁrst
is based upon an asymmetric pulse combining a frequency ω and its second
harmonic 2ω resonant with a vibrational transition. A much more eﬃcient
mechanism is the so-called “kick” that a highly asymmetric sudden pulse can
impart to the molecule. Half-cycle pulses, within the reach of current experi-
mental technology, are among good candidates for producing such kicks. Very
interestingly, an optimal control scheme for orientation, based on genetic algo-
rithms, also leads to a sudden pulsed ﬁeld bearing the characteristic features of
the kick mechanism. Optimal pulse shaping for very eﬃcient and long-lasting
orientation, together with robustness with respect to temperature eﬀects, are
among our future prospects.

nanoscale design [6, 7, 20, 24, 26, 27]. They address molecular manipulation,
involving external angular degrees of freedom, aiming at a parallel positioning of
the molecular axis with respect to the laser polarization vector (alignment ) or,
even more demanding, with a given direction (orientation). One of the basic mo-
tivations remains the drastic increase of reactive cross sections, highly sensitive to
stereodynamical eﬀects (frontal collisions). Laser-induced isomerization [10, 19],
isotope separation [6], molecular trapping [23], or surface processing and catal-
ysis [7, 24, 27] are some of the illustrations of the widely growing interest in
molecular manipulation.

∼

The most common idea is to excite a broad rotational band ∆J in order to re-
~
cover a narrow angular distribution ∆θ, through the celebrated relation ∆J∆θ
(J being the total angular momentum and θ the molecule-laser angle). Our ap-
proach to this problem is, however, diﬀerent. The emphasis is put on the depiction
and study of some laser-induced dynamical mechanisms that are relevant to the
alignment/orientation process: pendular states in high-frequency ﬁelds; two-photon
(fundamental and second-harmonic) excitations; the kick mechanism. The question
of how to take advantage of such mechanisms in a control scheme is brought up only
in a second step. Adiabatic transport from an isotropic distribution to a pendular
state; two IR laser pulses with frequencies in a ratio 2, the second harmonic be-
ing in resonance with a vibrational transition; very asymmetric and short-duration
(sudden) half-cycle pulses imparting sudden kicks to the molecule, are some of the
scenarios which are depicted and discussed in the following. Finally, in a third
step, this knowledge is fully exploited in optimal control schemes, not merely for
initial guesses in parameter sampling, but mainly to get a better understanding
and interpretation of otherwise black-box type calculations.

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 is devoted to intense laser align-
ment of the HCN molecule, through pendular states as the elementary mechanism
and adiabatic/sudden transport as the control strategy. Section 3 presents the two-
color orientation of HCN by a parity mixing scenario in the rotational distribution.
The kick mechanism with a half-cycle pulse sudden excitation scenario is examined
in section 4, as illustrated on the LiCl molecule. Sudden-excitation-based opti-
mal control scenarios, with a thorough analysis of the role of diﬀerent orientation
criteria, are analyzed, using HCN and LiF, in section 5.

2. Laser-controlled alignment

2.1. The model. The linear HCN molecule, taken as an illustrative example,
is described by its internal stretching motions (collectively labelled R) and external
rotational motions described by its polar θ and azimuthal ϕ angles with respect to
the laser polarization vector (see ﬁgure 1). The Hamiltonian involves a single Born-
Oppenheimer potential curve V (R) (the molecular electronic ground state) and the
radiative coupling ˆHrad(R, θ, ϕ, t) given by the scalar product of the ﬁeld-induced
dipole moment µ(R) with the electric ﬁeld amplitude E(t), i.e.,

of the resulting libration motion for a molecule that is in one of these eigenstates,

2.3. Control scheme. The question of how to take advantage of the pendular
mechanism to control molecular alignment can be answered by referring to adiabatic
vs sudden transport dynamics, starting from an initial isotropic distribution (J =
M = 0, as prepared, for instance, by laser cooling methods [2]).

The adiabatic switching of a laser with rise and fall times of 10 ps (same
order as the molecular rotational period) and an intensity of 1012 W/cm2 allows
an adiabatic transport on a single (lowest) pendular state with a good alignment
during the excitation. Figure 2(a) illustrates the alignment dynamics through the
expectation value of cos2 θ, i.e.,

To achieve post-pulse alignment, one may proceed with sudden excitations.
Figure 2(b) shows the eﬀect of a sudden pulse of 1.7 ps duration, which excites
several pendular states with a speciﬁc distribution (for a ﬁeld frequency resonant
with HCN internal vibrations). The particular J distribution reached is such that
alignment remains even after the pulse is oﬀ,

oscillations around a value of 0.5.

3. Two-color laser control of orientation (Parity breaking scenarios)

As compared to alignment, orientation, which imposes a given direction, is a
more challenging goal that requires symmetry breaking in the forward and backward
directions. Two such scenarios are considered in this work. The ﬁrst concerns the
use of two-color pulses, that is a combination of a fundamental frequency ω and its

where maximum asymmetry is reached for γ = 0.5 and φ = 0. But the asymmetry
we are referring to is not in the time dependence of
(t), which in any case is not
enough to produce orientation as, in average over an optical period of the ﬁeld,
the positive and negative contributions are canceling each other. We are rather
referring to parity breaking in the rotational quantum numbers J. As opposite to a
monochromatic ﬁeld that excites J’s of the same parity, two-color excitation has the
potentiality to mix J’s of diﬀerent parity. Actually, by taking 2ω in resonance with
the v = 0
1 vibrational transition of HCN, the absorption of a single photon
, whereas the
2ω excites odd J’s through the permanent dipole interaction µ0E
absorption of two photons ω excites even J’s through the polarizability interaction
2 (starting from an initial state J = M = 0) [8]. It is precisely the mixture of odd
α
and even J’s that produces, by the superposition of associated spherical harmonics,
the asymmetrical angular distributions that are looked for. The result is shown in
ﬁgure 3(a) as the expectation value of cos θ, which is a measure of orientation (the
higher the absolute value, the better the orientation). We see that orientation is
actually achieved at the extinction of the laser pulse and more eﬃciently a short
time after the pulse is oﬀ, with

reaching 0.3.

E

Orientation can also be achieved by an adiabatic transport from an initial
isotropic state to an asymmetric combination of pendular states by a two-color
excitation scheme [16, 17]. Contrary to the result shown in ﬁgure 3, such an ori-
entation can only be maintained while the laser is on, similarly to what is observed
for alignment in ﬁgure 2(a).

4. Half-cycle pulses and the kick mechanism

The second symmetry breaking scenario addresses the temporal shape of the
electric ﬁeld. The most asymmetrical situation that is experimentally reachable is
the use of half-cycle pulses (HCP’s) [5]. Such picosecond, far-IR electromagnetic
pulses are generated when illuminating a GaAs wafer, in the presence of a pulsed
electric ﬁeld applied across the surface, by a Ti-Sapphire laser [28]. Such pulses
have three interesting characteristics (as illustrated on ﬁgure 4):

(i) their intensities remain less than 108 W/cm2, therefore present no risk of

ionization damage on typical diatomic molecules;

(ii) their relatively broad Fourier transform (

30 cm−1) shows the presence
of non-negligible ﬁeld components that can induce rotational excitations;
(iii) they are very sudden with respect to rotation (their positive component
lasts typically 1 ps) and very asymmetric (the ratio of the positive to the
negative maximum is more than 10).

∼

A direct consequence is that such unipolar pulses can impact a “kick” to the mol-
ecule that eﬀectively orients it in the direction of the positive ﬁeld component, the
transfer of angular momentum taking place on the timescale of the short pulse [11].
The long-duration negative tail of the HCP is adiabatic enough not to induce fur-
ther noticeable changes in the dynamics. Actually, the kick seems the most eﬃcient
orientation mechanism up to date. The results are illustrated on the LiCl molecule
in terms of the dynamics of the average value of cos θ, in ﬁgure 5. As in the two-
color excitation scenario, the orientation remains modest during the positive part of
the pulse, but it develops later and reaches the value
0.5 over a large time
period of
4 ps. The kick mechanism by itself can be evidenced by working out a
sudden impact model [11]. Such a model is based on the short duration (tp = 1 ps)
of the pulse as compared to the molecular rotational period (Trot = 24 ps). The
calculation consists in freezing the rotational dynamics during the time the positive

quently advocates for the kick mechanism.

5. Optimal control scenarios

5.1. General frame. A completely diﬀerent approach in its philosophy, with-
out a priori reference to any dynamical mechanism, is optimal control. Such a
scheme presents a general structure resting on three steps:

(i) an evaluation function,

(t), involving the numerical solution of the
time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation (using split operator [3, 13, 14] or
basis expansion [4] techniques). For a laser-driven rigid rotor this amounts

(iii) a target j, i.e., an optimization criterion.
The optimization aims at the obtainment of the laser parameters (intensity,
frequency, temporal shape deﬁned by rise and fall times, together with possible
plateau durations) that optimally satisfy the target j. The optimization proce-
dure we use is based on genetic algorithms [1, 22] operating in a 7N dimensional
parameter space (i.e., 7 parameters for each of the N individual pulses).
It is
worthwhile noting that a given criterion puts the emphasis on a speciﬁc feature
of the orientation, such that diﬀerent criteria may lead to quite diﬀerent results.
This is basically related to the fact that orientation can by no way be achieved by
monitoring a single quantum state or a unique and pre-determined superposition
of states. We will analyze in some detail the consequences of the choice of speciﬁc
criteria. But before doing this, let us proceed to a ﬁrst optimization retaining an
for a single
intuitive, simple criterion that consists in the maximization of
time tf when the laser ﬁeld is oﬀ,

5.2. The kicked molecule. The optimal electric ﬁeld which is obtained and
illustrated in ﬁgure 6(a) turns out to be one of the most enlightening results of
this study. A combination of three individual pulses (i.e., 21 parameters to be
optimized) leads to a very sudden and asymmetric pulse, followed by a null plateau
and some rather symmetrical oscillations. The molecule (HCN taken as a rigid
rotor, in this example) orients through the already discussed kick mechanism due
to the fast angular momentum transfer by the unipolar pulse at about t = 0.3 ps
and during the null plateau lasting 1 ps. The symmetrical oscillations of this ﬁeld
between 1 and 1.7 ps do not seem to play a major part in this dynamics. Here
again, the kick mechanism can be evidenced by a sudden impact approximation
which closely follows the
dynamics at least until 1.5 ps [see ﬁgure 6(b)].
It is important to note that an accuracy of 4 digits in the genetic algorithm is
achieved for the intensities, frequencies, and absolute phase diﬀerences in order to
produce the particular shape of the electric ﬁeld of ﬁgure 6(a), responsible of the
subsequent kick mechanism. Figure 7 accounts for the long-time dynamics (i.e., for
full rotational period). Maximum orientation is reached at about t
10 ps and
lasts for about 3 ps. It is interesting to note that the result of the sudden impact
0.5 ps) can further be improved by introducing
model based on the ﬁrst kick (at
the eﬀect of the oscillatory ﬁeld acting after the null plateau as a second kick (that

electric ﬁeld amplitude as a function of ω and t. The asymmetric feature present in
the ﬁeld at around
0.15 ps turns out to be the superposition of two components
at frequencies ω and 2ω. This corresponds to the most asymmetrical electric ﬁeld
which, when truncated at a time that is not an integer of the optical period, leads
to a non-zero ﬁeld integral imparting the kick to the molecule. This is followed later

smaller kick. Such a result has a broader applicability: the same pulse applied to
a diﬀerent molecule (e.g., LiF) produces similar orientation dynamics [9].

5.3. The optimization criteria. We now return to a thorough analysis of
the consequences of choosing diﬀerent criteria in the optimization scheme. Ideally,
the best orientation is the one which is the most eﬃcient (i.e., with a value of
close to one) and which lasts forever. The relative merits of the diﬀerent
cos θ
h
criteria can thus be quantitatively measured in terms of the eﬃciency and the

i

duration of the orientation. All calculations that are presented hereafter apply to
the LiF molecule and are conducted within a parameter sampling space limited to
frequencies comprised in between 500 and 4000 cm−1, to individual pulses extinction
times less than tf taken as one tenth of a rotational period (as we are seeking post-
pulse orientation resulting from a sudden excitation, which also helps in keeping
calculations within acceptable CPU times) and to laser intensities not exceeding
1013 W/cm2 (to avoid risk of ionization damage, having in mind that 1.1
3
1014 W/cm2 is the predicted ﬁrst ionization threshold for LiF).

The criteria can roughly be classiﬁed into two groups: simple, when they em-
phasize either eﬃciency or duration; hybrid, when they realize a compromise be-
tween eﬃciency and duration. Aiming at the best orientation eﬃciency, a more
ﬂexible criterion then the one that has been used so far [equation (5.6)] is

(5.8)

the maximum being now taken at any time within the interval [tf , tf + Trot] (taking
into account the periodical behavior of the orientation dynamics with respect to
the rotational period Trot). The result is displayed in ﬁgure 9. The electric ﬁeld
thus obtained is built up from two individual pulses of comparable intensities, with
frequencies in a ratio of 2 responsible for the double wiggles in the amplitude, as
illustrated in ﬁgure 10. Excellent orientation (
0.8) is achieved with a
h
time delay of about 6 ps after the pulse is oﬀ. This molecular response time to
the laser interaction is the time needed for the speciﬁc phase interferences to occur
in the rotational wave packet. Such occurrences of the ﬁeld-free dynamics are
periodical (molecular rotational periodicity Trot), give rise to the revival structures
discussed in the literature [25], and are common to all results presented hereafter.
The criterion j1 fails in producing long-lasting orientation (the time interval
over which
remains larger than 70% of its maximum value does not exceed
0.37 ps). Another criterion is built to precisely maximize the orientation duration

The optimized electric ﬁeld shows two intense, sudden, high frequency and well
separated components (see ﬁgure 11), inducing a smooth behavior for
(t) as
expected for large values of τ , but unfortunately the orientation is very ineﬃcient.
The weakness of these simple criteria may be overcome by building physically
more sound hybrid criteria that combine the advantages of the previous require-
ments for a better compromise between eﬃciency and duration. Our best result is

Figure 12 displays the optimized ﬁeld built up from two sudden, intense pulses,
with very close frequencies (742 cm−1 and 808 cm−1) giving a beat-like structure.
It is worthwhile noting that the resulting ﬁeld appears as two beats of similar
780 cm−1 (see ﬁgure 13), but we failed in analyzing them in terms
frequency
of a double kick mechanism (the sudden impact model not providing the expected
orientation dynamics). Finally, in terms of quantitative measurements, this ﬁeld
larger than 0.5, and is
achieves orientation which lasts for 0.7 ps with a
one of the best results of the literature.

5.4. Robustness with respect to temperature. All calculations so far
presented concern an initially rotationless molecule, J = M = 0, M being the
quantum number labelling the projection of the rotational angular momentum on
the laser polarization vector taken as the laboratory reference axis. With respect
to experimental conditions, such a situation concerns a molecule at a temperature
of T = 0 K. Starting from such a state (prepared by laser cooling methods, for
instance [2]), linearly polarized photon absorption only populate higher J levels;
M , being a good quantum number (labelling an azimuthal angular motion, well
separated due to cylindrical symmetry), remains unchanged (i.e., zero). Increasing
temperature, on the other hand, populates higher J levels with all their M compo-
nents,

the total angular momentum vector J being orthogonal to the rigid rotor axis R and
θ being the polar angle positioning R with respect to the laser polarization vector.
Large values of M would thus prevent alignment and orientation, θ reaching a value
as high as π/2 for
= J, as illustrated in ﬁgure 14. Using linearly polarized laser
sources, no reduction of M could be achieved, showing that orientation is no more
a mathematically controllable process at non-zero temperature. Because they are
breaking the overall cylindrical symmetry, elliptically polarized lasers are possible
tools for modifying the values of M , in an optimally controlled way to lead again to
alignment and orientation. Work in this direction is now undertaken in our group.
It remains however that the robustness of our optimal control scheme can be

Figure 15 presents the results for the LiF molecule at T = 5 K. Here again,
simple (j1) and hybrid (j3-like) criteria are referred to. The dotted line (panel a)
represents the orientation dynamics at 5 K [equation (5.14)] but with the electric
ﬁeld of ﬁgure 9(a) optimized for T = 0 K. This is, precisely, to show how orienta-
tion eﬀects are rapidly washed out when incorporating higher initial M ’s. A ﬁeld
(t),
optimized for T = 5 K restitutes again the oscillatory structures of

6. Conclusion

The complementarity between basic mechanisms and optimal control schemes
can be summarized either by referring to the way of implementing mechanisms in
control, or reversely of identifying mechanisms revealed from control.

The ﬁrst strategy rests on three observations:

(i) there is no single solution arising from optimal control scenarios (not only
diﬀerent criteria, but also diﬀerent sampling spaces for parameters would
lead to diﬀerent results);

(ii) a careful study of the laser-induced dynamics can help to the identiﬁcation
(or guess) of some basic mechanisms leading to the desired observable;

(iii) by appropriately building the targets and delineating the parameter sam-
pling space, we can help the optimal control scheme to take advantage of
the mechanisms.

The second strategy consists in learning a dynamical mechanism presenting
some robustness from the optimal control results. This mechanism may be used
directly for reaching the desired observable (strategy 2) or further improved by
implementing it again in a control scenario with some additional ﬂexibility (strategy
1).

The kick mechanism and the optimal control carried out using sudden pulses
is an example that illustrates these two routes. The mechanism has actually been
depicted using half-cycle pulses and a sudden impact model. The parameter sam-
pling space for the optimal control, although not constrained, has been limited to
sudden pulses that are precisely compatible with the kick mechanism. This control
scenario has ﬁnally revealed a double-kick mechanism which can serve as a starting
point of a train of kicks, that we can merely guess to provide even better orienta-
tion. Finally, this mechanism, together with some additional free parameters such
as the time delay between the successive kicks, can be re-injected (re-introduced)
in an optimal control scheme (strategy 1) aiming at improving its eﬃciency. We
are presently pursuing some investigations in this direction.

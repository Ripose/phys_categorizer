Abstract

We reply to the remarks by L´ang and Hor´anyi [Electrochim. Acta Vol. (2006) page]
on the meaning of the notion of “electrosorption valency” used in I. Abou Hamad et
al., Electrochim. Acta 50 (2005) 5518. It is concluded that, contrary to the assertion
of L´ang and Hor´anyi, the magnitude of the current in the external circuit upon
adsorption of an ion of charge ze with partial charge transfer is indeed given by an
electrosorption valency γ such that |γe| < |ze|. We believe the conclusion of L´ang
and Hor´anyi to the contrary is the result of an excessively severe charge-neutrality
requirement.

1 Introduction

In their interesting discussion article [1], L´ang and Hor´anyi (LH) question
the concept of electrosorption valency [2,3] as interpreted in our recent paper
on Cl electrosorption on Ag(100) [4]. As we understand their argument, its
central point is the requirement of charge neutrality in the solution phase
and separately in a surface layer consisting of the speciﬁcally adsorbed ions
(traditionally known as the Inner Helmholtz Layer, IHL) and the adjoining
part of the metal in the working electrode. These two separate conditions,
when applied simultaneously, lead them to the conclusion that the charge
transported through the external circuit due to the speciﬁc adsorption of an
ion of charge ze must be ze, regardless of possible partial discharge of the
adsorbate, unless coadsorption of ions of opposite charge takes place.

We argue that this double application of the charge-neutrality requirement
overconstrains the problem and leads to an erroneous conclusion. The cor-
rect region over which charge neutrality should be applied must include the
parts of the solution phase close to the IHL, traditionally known as the Outer
Helmholtz layer (OHL) and the diﬀuse double layer (DDL). See Fig. 1 for
deﬁnitions of these terms. This polarized region, representing the half-cell of
the working electrode, is separated from the rest of the system by ﬁctitious
bounding surfaces inside the uniform, macroscopically uncharged bulk media
(electrolyte and metal, respectively). This schematic partitioning of the sys-
tem removes the need to consider the counter electrode explicitly in calculating
the charge transport. A completely analogous condition of charge neutrality
is independently obeyed at the counter electrode. The current through the
working electrode into the external circuit induces a current of opposite sign,
but with the same magnitude, through the counter electrode. For instance, if
chloride adsorbs at the working electrode, a (partial) negative charge will be
released into the external circuit, while a corresponding negative charge will,
on average, be injected through the counter electrode. In the present case, this
latter charge will most probably transform a corresponding amount of H+ into
1
2H2, thus maintaining electroneutrality in the entire system.

Our conclusion, for which we argue below, is that the expressions for elec-
trosorption valency and adsorbate dipole moment used in Ref. [4] correspond
to the approximations of excess supporting electrolyte, as well as to identify-
ing the electrosorption valency with the negative of the partial charge-transfer
coeﬃcient. While not exact, these are reasonable approximations, supported a
posteriori by the good agreement between the numerical results for our model
system and the experimental adsorption isotherms. In the process we recon-
ﬁrm Vetter and Schultze’s relation between the electrosorption valency and
the current in the external circuit [3].

Details of our arguments, including the approximations used in Ref. [4] (and
also in Ref. [5]), are given below. In Sec. 2 we discuss the deﬁnition of the
electrosorption valency; in Sec. 3 we discuss its relation to the current in the
external circuit; and in Sec. 4 we obtain its relation to the surface dipole
moment. Our conclusions are summarized in Sec. 5.

2 Electrosorption Valency

The electrosorption valency was thermodynamically formalized by Vetter and
Schultze [2,3] to account for the current in the external circuit during elec-
trosorption with partial charge transfer [6]. Abbreviated derivations have been
presented later (see, e.g., Ch. 18 of Ref. [7]), but we believe the most detailed
treatment is given in Refs. [2,3], as supplemented by Refs. [8,9,10]. Results of
these early papers were recently summarized by Schultze and Rolle [11,12].

Vetter and Schultze consider an electrosorption reaction for an ion of valence
z with the possible charge transfer of a noninteger number λ of electrons,
described by the equation [2,3,8,9,10]

νM−OH2 + Sz ·aq ⇋ M−Sz+λ + λe−(met) + νH2O·aq .

(1)

To avoid extrathermodynamic complications arising from considering the mi-
croscopic structure of the DDL [13], we here restrict ourselves to the case of
excess supporting electrolyte, so that the potential at the OHL, φOHL, is the
same as that in the bulk electrolyte, φe, [2,3,9], which we can deﬁne equal to
zero without loss of generality. See Fig. 1. This is indeed the condition corre-
sponding to the experiments reported in Refs. [4,5]. The electrode potential
is then E = φmet + cst., where φmet is the potential of the metal. Thus, in the
case of excess supporting electrolyte, diﬀerentiation with respect to E is the
same as with respect to (φmet − φOHL). The excess of supporting electrolyte
also reduces the concentration of adsorbate ions Sz in the DDL, while a rela-
tively low concentration of adsorbate ions relative to the solvent reduces their
concentration in the OHL relative to the IHL. In this approximation we can
therefore replace the total surface excess of adsorbate ions, ΓS, by the surface
coverage θ of the speciﬁcally adsorbed, partially discharged species Sz+λ in
the IHL [2]. The coverage is deﬁned as the number of speciﬁcally adsorbed
ions per adsorption site on the surface. In what follows, we shall use θ as an
approximation for the more general ΓS.

In Ref. [2], the electrosorption valency is deﬁned as

γ =

∂µS
∂E !θ

 

,

(2)

3

(3)

(4)

where µS is the chemical potential of Sz in the bulk solution. From this and a
general adsorption isotherm corresponding to the reaction equation (1), they
obtain the relation

γ = γPZC −

E

1
e

ZEPZC

 

∂CD
∂θ !E

′

dE

,

where e is the elementary charge unit and CD is the capacitance of the compact
double layer (metal vs. IHL). The subscript PZC refers to the Potential of Zero
Charge. The value of γ at the PZC is

γPZC = gz − λ(1 − g) + κad − νκw .

Here, κad and κw refer to the eﬀects of the dipole moments of the adsorbate
and water, respectively, and can usually be neglected for inorganic, aqueous
electrolytes. The factor g = (φIHL − φOHL)/(φmet − φOHL) is the ratio of the
potential diﬀerence between the adsorbate and the OHL to that between the
metal and the OHL and is frequently of the order of 0.2. A simple interpre-
tation of the schematic Fig. 1 with a near-linear potential proﬁle would lead
to the traditional interpretation of g as a purely geometric factor. For more
realistic microscopic models that lead to a nonlinear potential proﬁle, such
as illustrated in Fig. 1, the connection of g to the geometry of the interface
region is less clear.

Equations (3) and (4) reveal two important approximations in our Refs. [4,5].
The ﬁrst is that the integral in Eq. (3) is approximated by a linear function
in the coverage θ. This is reasonable since any changes in γ with E are likely
to be largely due to the increased crowding on the surface.

The second approximation, which is expressed in Sec. 2.2 of our Ref. [4] (and
also quoted verbatim in the ﬁfth paragraph of LH [1]), is that we take g = 0.
This leads to Lorentz’ approximation γPZC = −λ [6] and corresponds to the
situation that the full potential drop happens between the bulk metal and the
IHL. A somewhat better approximation is probably the minimum value for
water, gmin ≈ 0.16, obtained by Schultze and Koppitz [10].

3 Surface Charge and Potentiostatic Current

The crucial problem of the interpretation of γ in terms of the current in the
external circuit is treated by Vetter and Schultze in Ref. [3]. The central point
is that even a partial discharge corresponding to λ 6= 0 merely corresponds to
a redistribution of charge in the interface region. Therefore, all currents in the

4

circuit are capacitive, corresponding to changes in the excess charge density
on the metal, qmet, and the corresponding quantity on the electrolyte side, qe.
(By the requirement of charge neutrality, qe = −qmet.) Considering qmet as a
function of θ and E, one thus gets the current density

i =

dqmet
dt

=

∂qmet
∂θ !E

dθ
dt

 

+

∂qmet
∂E !θ

dE

.

(5)

From the electrocapillary equation for the compact double layer (i.e., the full
diﬀerential of the surface free energy density or “surface tension” σ),

− dσ = (zmetΓmet − Γe− + λθ)e dE + θdµS +

Γjdµj ,

(6)

Xj

they obtain

qmet ≡

∂σ
∂E !µS,µj

 

= (zmetΓmet − Γe− + λθ)e ,

(7)

where zmet, Γmet, and Γe− refer to the ions and conduction electrons of the
electrode. The current density at constant potential , ipot, is thus obtained
from Eq. (5) by setting dE/dt = 0. The necessary relation to γ as deﬁned in
Eq. (2) is found by writing

and using the Maxwell relation obtained from the electrocapillary equation,

together with the standard equality for any three quantities related by a single
equation,

∂qmet
∂θ !E

 

=

∂qmet
∂µS !E  

∂µS
∂θ !E

 

∂qmet
∂µS !E

 

=

∂θ
∂E !µS

 

,

∂θ
∂E !µS  

∂E
∂µS !θ  

∂µS
∂θ !E

 

= −1 .

Thus,

ipot =

∂qmet
∂θ !E

dθ
dt

 

= −γe

dθ

.

To appreciate this derivation it is important to realize that the current at
constant potential is not a simple quantity. As pointed out by Schmickler
[14], conceptually it involves two steps: ﬁrst the adsorption of the ion and
corresponding buildup of the image charge, which changes the potential , fol-
lowed by readjustment of the charges to bring the potential back to its original
value. Without a detailed, microscopic model, these semimacroscopic, thermo-
dynamic results cannot tell us in detail how the charges are distributed in the
interface region. This is a major limitation of the concept of electrosorption
valency.

The applicability of the results summarized above to reversible electrodes (as
opposed to perfectly polarizable ones) was questioned by Frumkin, Damaskin,
and Petrii in Ref. [13]. In response, Vetter and Schultze explicitly established
the validity of their results for reversible electrodes in Ref. [9].

4 Surface Dipole Moment

While the quantities discussed in Sec. 3 are purely thermodynamic quanti-
ties (in the case of excess supporting electrolyte), a microscopic theory of
the interface structure is necessary to estimate the dipole moment associated
with adsorption of an ion [14,15,16]. Generally, the dipole moment of a (one-
dimensional) charge distribution q(x) is deﬁned as

p =

x q(x) dx .

x2

Zx1

(12)

(13)

The result is independent of the coordinate system if the integration limits
x2
are chosen such that charge neutrality is obeyed over [x1, x2]:
x1 q(x) dx = 0
[17]. The charge distribution produces a potential diﬀerence, φ2 − φ1 = p/ǫ,
R
where ǫ is the dielectric constant of the medium. The details depend on the
microscopic model.

The approximation used in Ref. [4] is the commonly used one [18,19], due to
Bange et al. [20] and Schmickler [7,14],

p =

zeǫ
CH (cid:18)

1 −

γ
z (cid:19)

,

where CH is the Helmholtz capacity. This result is derived under the condition
of charge neutrality (but not necessarily vanishing dipole moment) over the
DDL. It can be obtained simply within the picture illustrated in Fig. 1 as
follows. The dipole moment is related to the potential drop from the metal

6

to the layer of speciﬁcally adsorbed ions as p = ǫ(φmet − φIHL) = ǫ(1 − g)E.
Assuming the ﬁeld dependence of γ in Eq. (3) can be included in g and λ, and
ignoring the polarization terms κ when solving Eq. (4) for (1 − g), we obtain

p =

zǫE
z + λ (cid:18)

1 −

γ
z (cid:19)

.

p =

(1 − g)

1 +

λ
z !

.

 

zeǫ
CH

By setting CH = e(z + λ)/E, we get Eq. (13), which can be rewritten in terms
of (1 − g) and the partial charge-transfer coeﬃcient λ as

(14)

(15)

The prefactor zeǫ/CH can be viewed as an eﬀective dipole distance. However,
due to screening by both the liquid and the electron gas of the metal, this dis-
tance is generally much smaller than the ionic radius of the adsorbate [14,15].
Equation (15) with g = 0 was the one used in Ref. [4] for the dipole moment,
and therefore for the lateral adsorbate interactions.

An alternative approach is to consider the surface dipole moment as the basic,
physical quantity, and γ as a derived quantity linked to p by Eq. (13) under
assumption of the geometric model described in Fig. 1.

5 Conclusion

In this discussion paper we have summarized arguments showing that the
electrosorption valency γ as deﬁned by Vetter and Schultze [2] gives the cor-
rect result for the current in the external circuit due to adsorption of an ion
of charge ze, Eq. (11) [3], as well as the relation between γ and the charge-
transfer coeﬃcient λ, Eq. (4) [2]. These results show that there is no need
for coadsorption with an oppositely charged ion to reduce the current per
adsorbate particle from ze, to γe. We note that the derivation of these re-
sults requires charge neutrality over the whole interface region, as indicated
in Fig. 1, not separately over the electrolyte and the compact double layer, as
we understand the argument of LH to imply. We believe the reason for their
conclusion that partial charge transfer cannot change the current is a result
of their overly strict charge-neutrality requirement.

Beyond these general results, we have shown that the approximations used
in Refs. [4,5] are excess supporting electrolyte and vanishing of the factor g.
While certainly not exact, these assumptions are reasonable for the systems
studied and give very good agreement between the computer simulations of
the lattice-gas model and the experimental adsorption isotherms.

7

Finally we note that the arguments given here are based on classical thermo-
dynamics with no speciﬁc assumptions on the microscopic structure of the in-
terface region, beyond the charge neutrality. In order to obtain explicit results
for microscopic parameters without ﬁtting to experiments, one would need
quantum-statistical-mechanical calculations that are still beyond our compu-
tational capacity. Only such future calculations have the potential to deter-
mine explicitly such quantities as the surface dipole moment and the spatial
distribution of charge and dipole moments in the whole interfacial region.

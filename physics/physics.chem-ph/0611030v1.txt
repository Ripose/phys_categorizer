The classical Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) theory of electrolytes assumes a dilute solution of point
charges with mean-ﬁeld electrostatic forces. Even for very dilute solutions, however, it predicts
absurdly large ion concentrations (exceeding close packing) for surface potentials of only a few
tenths of a volt, which are often exceeded, e.g. in microﬂuidic pumps and electrochemical sensors.
Since the 1950s, several modiﬁcations of the PB equation have been proposed to account for the
ﬁnite size of ions in equilibrium, but in this two-part series, we consider steric eﬀects on diﬀuse
charge dynamics (in the absence of electro-osmotic ﬂow). In this ﬁrst part, we review the literature
and analyze two simple models for the charging of a thin double layer, which must form a condensed
layer of close-packed ions near the surface at high voltage. A surprising prediction is that the
diﬀerential capacitance typically varies non-monotonically with the applied voltage, and thus so does
the response time of an electrolytic system. In PB theory, the capacitance blows up exponentially
with voltage, but steric eﬀects actually cause it to decrease above a threshold voltage where ions
become crowded near the surface. Other nonlinear eﬀects in PB theory are also strongly suppressed
by steric eﬀects: The net salt adsorption by the double layers in response to the applied voltage is
greatly reduced, and so is the tangential ”surface conduction” in the diﬀuse layer, to the point that
it can often be neglected compared to bulk conduction (small Dukhin number).

INTRODUCTION

A. Dilute solution theory

In this two-part series, we develop a simple analyti-
cal theory for the dynamics of electrolytes, taking into
account steric eﬀects of ﬁnite ion size. Motivated by
recent experiments in microﬂuidics, microbatteries, and
electrochemical sensors, our motivation is to describe the
response of an electrolyte to an applied voltage of several
volts, which is large enough to cause crowding of ions near
a surface, even if the bulk solution is very dilute and in
the absence of surface reactions. The ions thus lose their
classical Poisson-Boltzmann distribution, which has ma-
jor implications for their dynamics.

As a guide to the reader, we summarize the main re-
sults. The present ”Part I” begins in this section with
a historical review of dilute solution theory, its limita-
tions at large voltages, and attempts to account for steric
hindrance, speciﬁc interactions, and many-body electro-
statics. As a ﬁrst approximation, we focus only on steric
eﬀects, and analyze the dynamical response of a thin dif-
fuse layer to a large applied voltage, using two simple
continuum models (section II). The key results, common
to both steric models, are: (i) the diﬀuse layer’s diﬀeren-
tial capacitance is bounded and decreases at large voltage
(section III), and (ii) it cannot easily engulf enough ions
to perturb the bulk concentration or to conduct signiﬁ-
cant tangential currents (section IV). These predictions
are completely opposite to those of dilute solution theory
(based on the Gouy-Chapman model of the diﬀuse layer).
In the companion paper ”Part II”, we propose general,
time-dependent equations with steric constraints and re-
visit the parallel-plate charging problem in more detail.

For the past century, dilute solution theory has pro-
vided the standard model of electro-diﬀusion of ions [59,
70, 81] and electrokinetic phenomena [47, 60]. The fun-
damental assumption is that the chemical potential of a
point-like ion i in a dilute solution has the simple form,

µi = kT ln ci + zieψ

(1)

where zie is the charge, ci the concentration, and ψ the
electrostatic potential, determined in a mean-ﬁeld ap-
proximation by Poisson’s equation,

typically with a constant permittivity ε. The form (1) is
sometimes called the “ideal” component of the chemical
potential [37], to which various “excess” components at
ﬁnite concentration can be added (see below).

In many situations, it is assumed that the ions are
in quasi-thermal equilibrium with a Boltzmann distribu-
tion,

is less well known that Gouy [41] also solved the case of
an asymmetric 2z : z electrolyte.) Although this solu-
tion may seem quite special, it describes the most com-
mon situation where diﬀuse charge is conﬁned to a thin
capacitor-like “double layer” near a solid surface. The
width of the diﬀuse layer is the Debye [26] (or, more
properly, Gouy [41]) screening length,

The screening length (λD ≈
electrolytes) is typically much smaller than any geo-
metrical length, so bulk solution remains quasi-neutral
with diﬀuse charge conﬁned to thin, locally ﬂat, quasi-
equilibrium double layers.

basis for the classical theory of tangential “surface con-
duction” through the diﬀuse layer [10, 11, 27, 30], as
well as the recently noted phenomenon of salt “adsorp-
tion” (or “uptake”) from the neutral bulk by the dif-
fuse layer in response to a large applied voltage [6, 24].
Such predictions of the GC model have major implica-
tions for electrokinetic phenomena of the ﬁrst kind, such
as electro-osmosis, electrophoresis, streaming potential,
and diﬀusiophoresis, at large surface potentials [47, 60].
Dilute solution theory has also been used in nearly ev-
ery model of diﬀuse charge during the passage of current.

“superlimiting” currents, the PB equation loses validity,
but dilute-solution theory is still used to describe diﬀuse
charge, which loses its Boltzmann distribution [91] and
extends into the bulk as “space charge” [82], while retain-
ing an inner boundary layer at the screening length [23].
The dilute-solution space-charge model is the basis for
theories of electrokinetic phenomena of the second kind,
such as super-fast electrophoresis [29] and hydrodynamic
instability at a limiting current [83].

Dilute solution theory has also been used to describe
the dynamics of electrolytes, subject to time-dependent
applied voltages. The classical description comes from
the Poisson-Nernst-Planck equations (PNP), which con-

where Di = constant is normally assumed. Again,
general solutions are only possible upon linearization,
where the potential satsiﬁes the Debye-Falkenhagen
equation [26].
In the nonlinear regime, for thin dou-
ble layers, the GC solution again holds since the diﬀuse-
charge remains in quasi-equilibrium, and the diﬀuse-layer
acts like a voltage-dependent diﬀerential capacitance in
series with a bulk resistor [62]. Such equivalent circuit
models can be derived systematically from the PNP equa-
tions by aymptotic analysis, which also reveals correc-
tions at large voltages, due to bulk diﬀusion in response
to salt adsorption [6] and surface conduction [24] at large
applied voltages.
Such nonlinear diﬀuse-layer eﬀects
could be important in intepretting impedance spectra
in electrochemical sensing [36, 63], or in understanding
high-rate thin-ﬁlm rechargeable batteries [28, 69, 95, 96].
Another current motivation to study nonlinear diﬀuse-
charge dynamics comes from “induced-charge” electroki-
netic phenomena [5]. The preceding models of double-
layer relaxation have been used extensively in theories of
AC pumping of liquids over electrode arrays [1, 7, 40,
78, 79? ], induced-charge electro-osmotic ﬂows around
metallic colloids [35, 66] and microstructures [7, 57, 92],
and dielectrophoresis [87, 89, 93] and induced-charge
electrophoresis[5, 25, 93, 98] of polarizable particles in
electrolytes, although a nonlinear analysis based on the
PNP equations has not yet been attempted for any of
these situations. This may be a good thing, however,
since we will show that dilute solution theory generally
breaks down in the regime of experimental interest, where
the applied voltage is much larger than the thermal volt-
age, V > ψT .

B. Validity of the nonlinear model for dilute
solutions

Dilute solution theory provides a natural starting point
to understand nonlinear eﬀects in electrolytes, and the
GC model is used in all of the examples above to model
the diﬀuse layer at large applied potentials. In spite of its

mathematical appeal, however, nonlinear dilute solution
theory has limited applicability, due to the exponential
sensitivity of the counter-ion concentration to voltage.
For example, in the typical case of quasi-equilibrium, the
Boltzmann factor (3) brings nonlinearity to the PB equa-
tion (4) when ψ > ψT , but this dependence is so strong
that the surface potential cannot get much larger without
invalidating the assumption of a dilute solution.

≈

To see this, note that there must be a maximum con-
centration, cmax = a−3, of counterions packed with typi-
cal spacing a near a highly charged surface. This eﬀective
ion size is clearly no smaller than the ionic radius (typ-
1 ˚A), although it could be considerably larger
ically
(several nm), taking into account hydration eﬀects and
ion-ion correlations, especially in a large electric ﬁeld.
For the sake of argument, consider a very dilute bulk
solution, c0 = 10−5M, with a = 3 ˚A and z = 1. The
nonlinear regime begins at a diﬀuse-layer potential ΨD
kT /ze = 25 mV, but the steric limit is reached in di-
13kT /ze = 330 mV, where

Since the solution ceases to be “dilute” well below the
steric limit, there is only a narrow window of surface
potentials (
200 mV), sometimes called “weakly
nonlinear regime” [6], where nonlinearity arises and the
fundamental assumption (1) remains valid.

Unfortunately, the most interesting predictions of the
non-linear PB theory tend to be in the “strongly non-
linear regime”, where the dilute approximation fails dra-
matically. For example, the Dukhin number, which con-
trols the relative importance of tangential conductivity
in a thin diﬀuse layer, σs, compared to bulk conduc-
tivity, σ, at a geometrical scale L, has the following
form [10, 11, 27],

assuming the Gouy-Chapman model. This is also the
dimensionless ratio, Γs/c0L, of the excess surface con-
centration of ions, Γs, relative to the bulk concentration,
so it also governs the (positive) adsorption of neutral salt
from the bulk in response to an applied voltage [6, 61].
The general derivation of Eq. (9) assumes a thin double

layer [24], but in that case (λD ≪

is signiﬁcantly violated, ΨD > Ψc, rendering Equation
(9) inappropriate. Similar concerns apply to other non-
linear eﬀects in Gouy-Chapman theory, such as the rapid
increase of the diﬀerential capacitance (deﬁned below)

which would have important implications for electro-
chemical relaxation around conductors [6, 24, 88] and
for AC electro-osmosis [3, 58].

C. Beyond the Poisson-Boltzmann picture

We are certainly not the ﬁrst to recognize the limi-
tations of dilute solution theory. Historically, concerns
about the unbounded capacitance of a thin diﬀuse layer
in the GC solution (10) ﬁrst motivated Stern [94] to hy-
pothesize that there must also be compact layer of ad-
sorbed ions on the surface, as originally envisioned by
Helmholtz [44]. The Stern layer is where electrochemical
reactions, such as ion dissociation (setting the equilib-
rium charge on a dielectric) and/or redox couples (set-
ting the Faradaic current at an electrode), are believed
to occur, within a molecular distance of the solid sur-
face [59, 60]. The Stern layer capacitance (see below)
helps to relieve the overcharging of the diﬀuse layer in
Gouy-Chapman theory, but, due to steric constraints, it
too cannot conceivably withstand a voltage much larger
than Ψc. Instead, at larger voltages, the region of ion ac-
cumulation must inevitably extend away from the surface
into the solution, where ions undergo hindered transport
in a concentrated solution without having speciﬁc inter-
actions with the solid.

The most basic aspect of a concentrated solution is
the ﬁnite molecular length scale, a0. Over half a cen-
tury ago, Wicke and Eigen [31, 32, 97] made perhaps the
ﬁrst attempts to extend dilute solution theory to account
excluded volume eﬀects in a simple statistical mechani-
cal treatment. The theory was developed further in the
past decade by Iglic and Kral-Iglic [14, 15, 48, 54] and
Borukhov, Andelman, and Orland [17, 18, 19]. These au-
thors proposed free energy functionals, based on contin-
uum (mean-ﬁeld) approximations of the entropy of equal-
sized ions and solvent molecules, which they minimized
to derive modiﬁed Poisson-Boltzmann equations (MPB).
The motivation for this work was mainly to address the
eﬀect of large ions, whose sizes may be comparable to
the screening length, in an equilibrium diﬀuse layer with
ψT . Our main point here is that crowding eﬀects
ΨD ≈
can also be very important for small ions near a polar-
izable surface, when subjected to a “large” voltage the
exceeding the threshold Ψc. No matter how dilute is the
bulk solution, a suﬃciently large electric ﬁeld can always
draw enough ions to the surface to create a concentrated
solution in the diﬀuse layer.

There have also been attempts to go beyond the mean-
ﬁeld approximation of steric eﬀects, by treating speciﬁc
(and in some cases also Coulombic) ion-ion and ion-wall
interactions. Simple MPB equations have been proposed,
which modify the charge density to account for the spa-
tial correlation function between an ion in solution and
a ﬂat wall (via an eﬀective external potential) based on
molecular dynamics simulations [33, 50, 76], but such
models are not easily extended to any other geometry,
such as a rough wall [53]. Corrections of this type can
also be obtained from a general probabilistic model of
interacting ions, whose dynamics are given by nonlin-
early coupled Langevin equations. Using this approach,
Schuss, Nadler and Eisenberg rigorously derived “condi-

tional PNP” (and PB) equations where each ion concen-
tration ci(r) in the mean-ﬁeld Poisson’s equation (2) is
replaced by the conditional probability density of ﬁnd-
ing an ion at a certain position, given the positions of
the other ions [67, 68, 86], although a simple closure of
the model requires further assumptions about statistical
correlations.

There are a variety of general statistical mechanical ap-
proaches from liquid state theory [45], which have been
applied to electrolytes, taking into account not only steric
eﬀects, but also many-body electrostatic correlations (see
below). Since the 1970s, the modest, but challenging,
goal has been to accurately predict the equilibrium dis-
tribution of ions in Monte Carlo simulations of the “prim-
itive model” of charged hard spheres in a homogeneous
dielectric continuum bounded by a hard, charged wall.
Typically, the model is studied in the limit of “small” sur-
kT /e) relevant for equilibrium sur-
face potentials (ΨD ≈
faces. For example, a plethora of MPB equations (such as
“MPB4”, “MPB5”,...) perturbing Gouy-Chapman the-
ory have been derived by variations on the Mean Spher-
ical Approximation [21, 55, 56, 73, 74, 75, 84]. More
complicated, but often more accurate, theories have also
been derived using statistical Density Functional Theory
(DFT) [38, 39, 49]. By writing the ion ﬂux as the gradient
of an electrochemical potential obtained from the DFT
free energy functional [37] (as we do in Part II, using the
much simpler functional of Borukhov et al. [18]), it has
been shown that the selectivity of ion channels can be
understood to a large extent in terms of entropic eﬀects
of charged hard spheres [80].

In spite of many successes and the appealing ﬁrst-
principles nature of liquid-state theories, however, they
are not ideally suited for our purpose here of capturing
time-dependent, large-voltage eﬀects in a simple model.
Liquid-state theories are not analytically tractable and
thus not easily coupled to macroscopic continuum mod-
els, although perhaps empirical ﬁts could be developed
for quantities of interest. For example, the DFT ap-
proach requires nontrivial numerical methods, just to
evaluate the steady ﬂux in a one-dimensional ion chan-
nel [37, 80]. Another concern is that liquid-state theories
have been designed and tested only for “small” voltages
kT /e) at equilibrium surfaces, so it is not clear
(ΨD ≈
how well they would perform at large, time-dependent
voltages, since there are no rigorous error bounds. For ex-
ample, the double-layer diﬀerential capacitance in modi-
ﬁed PB theories often increases with voltage [73], some-
times even faster than in PB theory [84], but we will
argue below that it must decrease at large voltages, es-
pecially in concentrated solutions. In light of the scaling
eΨD/kT from PB theory (3), a related problem is that,
until recently [49, 55], most theories have been unable
to predict the decay of capacitance at low temperature
in concentrated solutions. Although liquid-state theories
for large voltages should certainly be developed, we will
focus on much simpler mean-ﬁeld, continuum descrip-
tions of steric eﬀects, in the hope of at least capturing

4

some qualitative features of nonlinear dynamics analyti-
cally, across a large range of applied voltages

Consistent with this approach, we will also work with
the mean-ﬁeld continuum description of electrostatic in-
teractions (2), which neglects discrete many-body corre-
lations. In passing, we point the reader to some of the
extensive literature on corrections to PB electrostatics,
for the simplest possible model of an equilibrium liquid of
point-like charges in a uniform dielectric medium. In the
absence of speciﬁc interactions (such as steric repulsion),
the fundamental length scale for ion-ion correlations is
7 ˚A in water at room tempera-
the Bjerrum length (
ture),

≈

4πεkT

at which the bare Coulomb energy balances the ther-
mal energy. Interesting consequences of many-body elec-
trostatics, not present in the mean-ﬁeld PB descrip-
tion, include Oosawa-Manning condensation of counteri-
ons around charged rods in polyelectrolytes [64, 71, 72],
renormalized charge of colloidal spheres [2, 8, 9], en-
hanced counterion localization around discrete surface
charges [46], and counterion-mediated attraction of like-
charged objects [42, 43, 65]. The latter phenomenon is
believed to be responsible for the condensation of DNA
in multivalent electrolytes [12], as well as the adhesion of
cement plaste [42, 52]. A key part of the physics is the
attraction between an ion and its “correlation hole” re-
sulting from a ﬂuctuation, which has recently been incor-
porated into a modiﬁed PB equation for a ﬂat wall [85].
In all of these problems, however, the equilibrium surface
charge is typically small (up to a monolayer of ions); it
would be interesting to study electrostatic correlations at
a much more highly charged surface, such as an electrode
applying a large voltage, V

ψT (our focus here).

≫
Finally, we mention solvent eﬀects, which are much
less studied, and surely also very important at large volt-
ages. Electrochemists widely believe that water dipoles
in the Stern layer are so highly aligned by large electric
ﬁelds that the eﬀective permittivity drops by an order
of magnitude (e.g. from 80ε0 to 5ε0) [13]. At large ap-
plied voltages, where typical ﬁelds are of order V/nm,
it is reasonable to expect that the reduced permittivity
would extend into the diﬀuse layer. This could have a
major eﬀect on ion-ion correlations, since the Bjerrum
ε−1 could get as large as 10 nm. Other as-
length lb ∝
pects of water structure, such as hydrogen bonded net-
works, could also be altered by large electric ﬁelds and
large ion concentrations. It would be interesting to per-
form ab initio quantum-mechanical simulations of highly
charged double layers to investigate such eﬀects, beyond
the primitive model.

Scope of the present work

II. TWO MODELS OF STERIC EFFECTS IN A
THIN DIFFUSE LAYER

5

In spite of the considerable literature on MPB descrip-
tions of electrolytes in equilibrium or in steady state con-
duction, we are not aware of any attempt to go beyond
dilute solution theory (PNP equations) in analyzing the
dynamics of electrolytes in response to time-dependent
perturbations, such as AC voltages. Accordingly, here we
develop only some very simple models with the goal of
identifying generic new features of diﬀuse-charge dynam-
ics in a concentrated solution. As such, it is preferrable
to start with equations that capture the essential physics,
while remaining analytically tractable, at least in some
representative cases. For this reason, we focus on mean-
ﬁeld theories of steric eﬀects and speciﬁcally build on
the MPB equation of Borukhov et al., which can be inte-
grated analytically in a few simple geometries [17, 18, 19].
Such models also make reasonable predictions across the
entire range of voltages.

The contribution is broken into two parts. Here, in
Part I, we consider the canonical problem of charging
a thin double layer, viewed as an eﬀective circuit ele-
ment [6]. We begin in section II by describing two sim-
ple models for steric eﬀects in a quasi-equilibrium diﬀuse
layer: (i) A “composite layer” model, consisting of a di-
lute PB outer region and, at high voltage, an inner “con-
densed layer” of ions packed at the steric limit, and (ii)
the MPB model of Borukhov et al., which decribes the
same transition in a continuous fashion. In section III,
we then analyze the diﬀuse-layer capacitance and its role
in equivalent circuit approximations. In section IV, we
calculate steric eﬀects on salt adsorption and tangential
surface conduction by the diﬀuse layer, and discuss how
these high-voltage eﬀects aﬀect and modify the applica-
bility of circuit models.
In section V, we also brieﬂy
discuss the eﬀects of a compact dielectric layer (which
could model a Stern layer of adsorbed ions, or, more ac-
curately, a thin ﬁlm coating the solid), before concluding
in section VI.

In Part II, we consider explicitly time-dependent prob-
lems with a general formalism, not only applicable to thin
double layers. We start with the free energy functional
of Borukhov et al. and derive modiﬁed Poisson-Nernst-
Planck equations (mPNP), based on a simple generaliza-
tion of chemical potential (1) for concentrated solutions.
As an illustration, we then repeat the nonlinear asymp-
totic analysis of Ref. [6] for the response of a blocking
electrochemical cell (no reactions at the electrodes) to a
suddenly applied voltage, to expose some general conse-
quences of steric eﬀects at large voltage. We also clarify
the range of validity of the thin-double-layer circuit ap-
proximations derived here in part I.

We focus on the response of a thin diﬀuse layer to an
applied voltage, where it suﬃces to consider only quasi-
equilibrium properties [6], as we justify carefully in Part
II. Following Gouy and Chapman, we consider the case of
a symmetric z : z electrolyte here, although our reasoning
is readily extendible to the general case. We also assume
that the permittivity ε is constant in space, which is cer-
tainly not correct when dense layers of ions form close
to the surface. However, this can be taken into account
in a following step and does not change the qualitative
picture emerging from the following analysis. We will
return to this point below in section V.

There are at least three important lengths in our mod-
els. The ﬁrst is the Debye length λD given by (5), which
sets the width of the diﬀuse layer at low voltage and low
bulk concentration, c0. The second is the mean spac-
ing of ions in the bulk electroylte, l0 = (2c0)−1/3, and
the third is the mean spacing of ions (essentially of the
same sign) at the maximum concentration, a = c−1/3
max .
A fourth scale L would characterize the geometry, as in
Part II, but here we consider the regime of thin double
L. A ﬁfth scale would be the Bjer-
layers, where λD ≪
rum length lB, which we neglect by making the usual
mean-ﬁeld approximation.

From the ﬁrst three lengths, there are two dimension-
less groups. The ﬁrst is a/λD, which we assume to be
small for simple electrolytes in somewhat dilute solutions,
so that steric eﬀects are important only very close to the
surface, at the inner portion of the diﬀuse layer (and even
then, only at large voltages). The second dimensionless
group can be written as the mean volume fraction of ions
in the bulk,

ν = 2a3c0 = (a/l0)3,

(11)

a natural measure of non-diluteness, which controls the
importance of steric eﬀects, along with the dimensionless
voltage, zeΨD/kT . In the ﬁgures below, we display re-
sults for ν = 0.00005, 0.005, and 0.5 to span the range
from dilute to highly concentrated solutions.

We stress that the phenomenological parameter a is
1 ˚A. We
not necessarily the diameter of an ion, a0
prefer to think of it as a cutoﬀ for the unphysical diver-
gences of PB theory, which we know must exist, and our
goal is to understand its consequences. This cutoﬀ length

could include at least a solvation shell, e.g. a
ion-ion correlations could eﬀectively increase it further,

A. A composite diﬀuse-layer model

In this model, we assume that the concentration ﬁelds

are governed by Boltzmann distributions

c± = c0e∓zeψ/kT

(12)

wherever they are meaningful, that is, whenever these
concentrations are weaker than a physical limit 1/a3,
which is set by the ion size. For both ion species, if
the formula (12) yields a quantity bigger than 1/a3, we
set the concentration ﬁeld of the counter-ion to be 1/a3,
and assume that the coions are excluded from the corre-
sponding condensed layer. The basic physics is shown in
Fig. 2.

For most geometries, such as rough surface, this model
is ill-posed and would require additional constraints to
determine the location the sharp free boundary separat-
ing the “dilute” Boltzmann region and the “condensed”
region at the maximum density. For a ﬂat, semi-inﬁnite
diﬀuse layer with a given total charge qD or total volt-
age ΨD, however, the transition occurs at a single well
deﬁned position, x = lc, away from the solid surface (at
x = 0). In that case, we separate the diﬀuse-layer into
two parts if the potential is strong enough
if a3c± < 1, x > lc

c± = c0e∓zeψ/kT
c± = a−3, c∓ = 0 if a3c0e∓zeψ/kT

Note that in this simplistic dichotomy the concentration
ﬁeld for co-ions is slightly discontinuous at the critical
potential mentioned earlier,

FIG. 2: (a) Most prior work in electrokinetics has dealt with
surfaces of pre-existing equilibrium charge at the scale of one
electron per surface atom or less. This charge can be screened
by roughly a monolayer of ions (partly in the diﬀuse layer)
which corresponds to a “small” double layer voltage, of order
ψT = kT /e. (b) In contrast, nonlinear electrokinetics deals
with polarizable (mainly metal) surfaces, where much higher
surface charge densities can be produced by an applied voltage
or electric ﬁeld nearby, and thus the double layer can “over-
charge” to the point where diluite-solution theory no longer
applies. The existence of a minimum ion spacing implies the
formation of a condensed layer of counterions near the surface.

simple, this model already captures steric eﬀects at large
voltages to a great extent.

Let us compute the thickness lc of the corresponding
layer of ”condensed” counter-ions. We consider an elec-
trode to which a strong negative potential ΨD is applied
to the diﬀuse layer with respect to the bulk, such that
ΨD > Ψc which leads to a condensed layer of

We note that, when compared to the PB charge density

reduced by the steric eﬀects at higher ΨD. In particular,
it increases only sublinearly, as opposed to exponentially
in the PB model.

B. The modiﬁed PB model

The second model we consider is the classical mean-
ﬁeld description of steric eﬀects in equilibrium mentioned
in the introduction; we refer the reader to the litera-
ture for its derivation and statistical mechanical assump-
tions [14, 15, 17, 18, 18, 19, 31, 32, 48, 54, 97]. For a
symmetric z : z electrolyte, the concentrations in the dif-
fuse layer as a function of the electrostatic potential with
respect to the bulk ψ are given by the modiﬁed Boltz-
mann distribution

where the packing parameter ν = 2a3c0 is again the bulk
ion density scaled to its maximum value and a is the
eﬀective size of the ions and the solvent molecules. Note
that the concentration of each ion saturates and cannot
exceed the steric limit.

In a mean-ﬁeld approximation with these ion con-
centrations, the potential satisﬁes the modiﬁed Poisson-
Boltzmann (MPB) equation,

Unlike the composite layer model, the MPB model can be
applied to any geometry (just like the PB model). In the
case of a ﬂat diﬀuse layer, it gives a similar description,
except that steric eﬀects enter smoothly with increasing
voltage, and there is no sharply deﬁned condensed layer.
As for the ﬁrst model, we can integrate the MPB equa-
tion across a thin double layer to obtain the normal elec-
tric ﬁeld at the inner part of the diﬀuse layer

FIG. 4: The diﬀuse layer charge given by PB, MPB and CDL

This formula is illustrated in Fig. 4, and compared
to the analogous formula for the composite diﬀuse-
layer model (22). Although the MPB concentrations
(13) have been analyzed carefully by previous au-
thors [14, 15, 17, 18, 18, 19, 48, 54],
it seems the
charge-voltage relation (27) has been overlooked, or at
least is not stated explicitly in these papers. (Similarly,
Chapman was the ﬁrst to explicitly write down the
formula (23) for the total charge [22], even though
Gouy had thoroughly analyzed the concentration and
potential proﬁles in the “Gouy-Chapman model” a few
years earlier [41].)

We note in passing that the asymptotic behaviour at
large voltages is similar for the two models presented,
and corresponds to a layer of essentially constant charge
density, which results using Poisson’s equation in a total
charge proportional to the square root of the potential
drop.

III. EQUIVALENT CIRCUIT ELEMENTS

A. A word on circuit models

As widely recognized in electrochemistry [36, 63, 90],
it is often appropriate to describe the eﬀect of the dou-

8

ble layers on the dynamic properties of a system through
eﬀective resistances and capacitances. The underlying
assumption, is that the equilibration time of the double
layer is fast compared to the dynamics of the global ”cir-
cuit” considered, essentially because it is so thin so that
transport processes within the double layer are rapid. A
mathematical justiﬁcation, starting from the simple PNP
equations, can be given in terms of an asymptotic anal-
ysis of the thin double layer limit [6].

Therefore, we anticipate that for the many situations
where the double layer is thin compared to the system
size, the dynamics can be understood to a signiﬁcant ex-
tent using the equilibrium characteristics of the double
layer. These then provide appropriate boundary condi-
tions for the dynamic transport processes in the bulk.

In particular, the analysis presented in Ref. [6], shows
that the capacitance, or more precisely the diﬀerential
capacitance “C”, of the double layer is a central quan-
tity allowing the modeling of the system in terms of an
“RC” circuit. The second quantity of relevance, as it
characterizes the entrance into the strongly non-linear
regime, is the neutral salt uptake by the double layer
which can result in an appreciable depletion of the bulk,
leading to modiﬁcations of its conductivity (aﬀecting the
resistance “R” in the circuit) and thus of the dynamics.
This paper and a subsequent one [24] also pointed out (in
the context of dilute solution theory) that the tangential
conduction through the diﬀuse layer is intimately tied to
neutral salt adsorption, and indeed is governed by the
same dimensionless “Dukhin number”.

Therefore, we will proceed to compute all of these dy-
namical quantities for a thin quasi-equilibrium double
layer, focusing on the general consequences of steric ef-
fects, which are common to the two models. After that,
we will return to the question of surface capacitance and
consider the eﬀect of a thin dielectric layer (such as an
oxide coating on a metal electrode, or perhaps a frozen
Stern layer of adsorbed ions) on the overall dynamical
response of the double layer.

B. Total and diﬀerential capacitances

The total capacitance of the diﬀuse layer can be ob-
tained directly from the previous equations relating q
(the charge per unit area in the diﬀuse layer) to ΨD
(the voltage drop across the double layer), as simply
q(ΨD)/ΨD. We have already computed these quan-
−
tities above, and they are compared to the PB result
(ν = 0) in Fig. 5.
It is immediately obvious that the
capacitance is greatly reduced at high voltage, compared
to the predictions of dilute solution theory. The eﬀect is
so dramatic that the capacitance in both models reaches
a maximum not much larger than the zero-voltage value,
and even decreases for all values of voltage at suﬃciently
high concentration – the opposite trend from PB theory.
As noted above, the diﬀerential capacitance, deﬁned

The diﬀerent models are compared in Fig. 6 and Fig.7 .
The qualitative trends in C are again similar in both
models of steric eﬀects and dramatically diﬀerent from
PB theory. For both models, the diﬀerential capacitance
increases at very low potentials (comparable to the ther-
mal voltage, kT /ze) as it does in the PB model because
steric eﬀects are still negligible. These enter the picture
at larger potentials and limit the storing capacity of the

layer, with a diﬀerential capacitance that actually de-
creases to zero at large potentials. As a consequence both
models predict a non-monotonic diﬀerential capacitance,
and show a maximum at intermediate values.

Of course, there are some clear diﬀerences in the de-
tailed predictions of the two models, shown in Figs.6 and
7. Although the limiting behaviors at large and small
voltage are similar, the transition is unphysically sudden
in the CDL model, compared to the more reasonable,
smooth transition in the MPB model. This is especially
true at low concentrations, where the sudden, delayed ap-
pearance of steric eﬀects in the CDL model gives rise to a
sharp cusp in the diﬀerential capacitance versus voltage.

At high concentrations, where the “low voltage” regime
of dilute solution theory eﬀectively vanishes, the CDL
model also fails to predict the immediate onset of steric
eﬀects, even at small voltages, which causes a monotonic
decrease in diﬀerential capacitance – the opposite trend
of the PB model. Nevertheless, the CDL model manages
to approximate the trends of the MPB model well, with
an appealingly simple physical picture.

In summary, three basic features show up in both mod-
els, which we take as an indication that they qualita-
tively hold irrespective of the speciﬁc approximations em-
bedded in each model: (i) the diﬀerential capacitance
CD(ΨD) is weaker at moderate and high potentials than
if steric eﬀects are neglected (as in the PB scheme); (ii)
at moderate concentrations, the diﬀerential capacitance
varies non-monotonously with a peak at intermediate
voltages and a slow decrease towards zero at higher volt-
ages, (iii) at the steric limit (ν = 1), the diﬀerential ca-
pacitance is a strictly decreasing function of voltage (in
the MPB model). These eﬀects are all explained by the
strong tendency of ions to form a condensed inner layer
at high voltage and/or high concentration, when steric
eﬀects are taken into account. This greatly reduces the
diﬀerential (and total) capacitance compared to classical
PB theory, which neglects the ﬁnite size of ions, and thus
predicts an absurd exponential pile-up of ions extremely
close to the surface (less than one molecular radius) in
the nonlinear regime.

C. Diﬀuse-layer charging dynamics

These revelations have important consequences for our
understanding of double-layer charging in many situa-
tions. In the simplest picture of an equivalent RC circuit,
with R the resistance of the bulk, these statements relate
to the response time of the system to a step or an AC ap-
plied voltage. The typical response time for a driving of
amplitude V is τc(V ) = RCD(V ), so the classical picture
from PB theory (29) has been that nonlinearity greatly
slows down the charging dynamics [6, 24, 58, 62, 88, 92].
Although this may occur in a dilute solution for a rela-
tively small range of voltages (typically only several times
the thermal voltage), steric eﬀects in a concentrated so-
lution bound the relaxation time at a value much less
than expected from the PB model, in both the CDL and
MPB models. This is clear in Fig. 8, where we solve the
RC circuit dynamics

IV. BEYOND CIRCUIT MODELS

A. Diﬀuse layer salt adsorption

As recently pointed out in Ref. [6], circuit models can
break down at large voltages if a large number of ions
(mostly counter-ions) are engulfed by the diﬀuse layers
with a resulting depletion of ions in the bulk. The total
salt concentration in the diﬀuse layer (counter-ions plus
co-ions) increases with voltage, regardless of the sign of
the charge. Therefore, a diﬀusion layer forms and relaxes
into the neutral bulk whenever a voltage is applied across
a double layer at a blocking surface (although reactions
and/or rejection of adsorbed ions from the Stern layer
could lead to negative adsorption or salt expulsion in
other situations [61]). In the absence of salt injection by
the surface, the positive adsorption of neutral salt by the
diﬀuse layer is present in the PB description, where the
counter-ion concentrations increase exponentially with
It is still present but obviously weaker in
voltage [6].
models accounting for steric eﬀects, which severely limit
the capaticity of the diﬀuse layer to store additional ions
at high voltage. We now quantify this statement using
the two simple models introduced above.

Following notations introduced in Ref. [6], we deﬁne

the excess neutral salt in the double layer as

Unlike the PB formula (33), which predicts expo-

steric modiﬁed formulae (34) and (35) predict sublinear
(square-root like) dependence on ΨD, at large voltages,
as can be seen by inspection of (33)-(35) or from the plots
in Fig. 9. This can be understood qualitatively as a con-
sequence of the roughly square-root voltage dependence
of the condensed layer width (due to its constant charge
density), since most of the adsorbed ions are condensed
counterions at large voltages. (See Fig. 3 and Eq. (21)

q/ze, which is true for any nonlinear
double layer model (PB, MPB, CDL,...) since the coion
density goes to zero across most of the diﬀuse layer at
large voltages. As explained in Ref. [6], in response to
an applied voltage the neutral bulk electrolyte becomes
depleted, as the electric ﬁeld draws counterions into the
diﬀuse layer and conducts coions away through the bulk,
resulting in a slowly expanding diﬀusion layer, reducing
the bulk concentration accordingly.

The main feature, again common to both models, is
that the salt uptake at large voltage is greatly reduced
in comparison to the exponential growth predicted by
the PB picture. This is important for the dynamics as
this quantity sets the limit of applicability of the widely
used RC circuit model [6]. This equivalent circuit ap-
proximation should thus hold up to much larger values
of potential when steric eﬀects are included.

B. Breakdown of circuit models

With analytical expressions for total salt adsorption
by the diﬀuse layer, we can estimate the upper limits
on the applied voltage where the circuit approximation
breaks down in the various models. For an electrolyte
cell of thickness 2L, the salt uptake by the diﬀuse layer
corresponds to a removal of 2w charge carriers (ions) per
unit surface, from a bulk that contained 2c0L such carri-
ers initially. As long as the ratio of these two quantities
w/(c0L) is small, the total resistance of the RC circuit
is roughly unaﬀected by the salt adsorption. So, an esti-

mate for the limit is [6]

For the models accounting for steric eﬀects, however,
the upper bound is greatly increased in concentrated so-
lutions,

This shows that the widely used circuit approximation
L does not break down
for a thin double layer λD ≪
(L/λD)2, in a concentrated
until enormous voltages, V
solution. In a very dilute solution, where ν = 2a3c0
1,
the circuit approximation may break down at moderate
voltages, but only in a microsystem, where the double
layers are not so thin. For example, even in an (aqueous)
electrolyte with λD = 10 nm, c0 = 10−3 M, a = 5 ˚A and
in a microdevice with L = 100µm features, the threshold
voltage (with steric eﬀects) is roughly 0.2 Volts.

≪

∝

This estimate, however, neglects the possibility of a
transient breakdown of the RC circuit approximation,
prior to diﬀusive relaxation across the entire cell. In the
case of response to a suddenly applied DC voltage, the
salt adsorption by each the diﬀuse layer occurs over a
time scale, τc = λDL/D, during which diﬀusion spreads
the nearby region of depleted neutral bulk solution over
a distance √Dτc = √λDL. Therefore, the requirement
that the local bulk conductivity does not change signiﬁ-
cantly during charging dynamics yields the reﬁned esti-
mate [6],

w

which replaces L/λD by
L/λ in the estimates above.
This sets a lower bound for the limiting voltage for the
validity of circuit models.

In the case of AC forcing at frequency ω, the bound
1,
1 is appropriate for low frequencies, 2πωτc ≪
αd ≪
but circuit models remain valid up to higher voltages at
higher frequencies. At moderate frequencies, 2πωτc > 1,
the double layer does not have enough time for complete
charging, and the Warburg-like diﬀusion layer due to salt
adsorption (which oscillates at twice the frequency) only
propagates to a distance,
D/4πω. Therefore, we may
crudely estimate (w/c0)

(A more careful estimate would take into account that
only partial charging and salt adsorption occur with in-
creasing frequency.) At higher frequencies, ωλ2

the diﬀuse layer does not have enough time to equilibrate,
and little charging occurs.

These arguments can be made more precise using
matched asymptotic expansions to describe the thin dou-
ble layer limit, starting from an explicitly time-dependent
model. For the case of one-dimensional response to a
suddenly applied voltage, this was done in Ref. [6] start-
ing from the Poisson-Nernst-Planck equations of (time-
dependent) dilute solution theory.
In part II, we will
derive modiﬁed PNP equations for dynamics with steric
eﬀects and repeat the same kind of asymptotic analysis
to reach a similar conclusion our simple arguments here:
Steric eﬀects greatly extend the range of applicability of
RC circuit models, compared to what would be expected
on the basis of dilute solution theory.

C. Diﬀuse-layer surface conduction

Another feature not present in circuit models is the
possibility of current passed along the surface through the
diﬀuse layer, demonstrated by Bikerman [10] and consid-
ered extensively in theories of electrokinetics by Dukhin
and collaborators [30]. As ﬁrst shown in Ref. [6] and elab-
orated in Ref. [24] in the setting of dilute solution the-
ory, the relative strengths of tangential “surface ﬂuxes”
through the diﬀuse layer, compared to bulk ﬂuxes, are
controlled by the same dimensionless groups that govern
ion adsorption (discussed above). This is actually quite
a general result, as we now brieﬂy explain. We will thus
conclude that steric eﬀects also greatly reduce the impor-
tance of surface conduction in the diﬀuse layer compared
to the classical predictions of dilute solution theory.

where the chemical potential µi generally has a diﬀer-

In a concentrated solution, we generally expect that the

Following Bikerman [10, 11, 24], we may estimate the
relative importance of surface to bulk ﬂux densities at a

is roughly half of the dimensionless group αs governing

We have seen that steric eﬀects greatly reduce w com-
pared to the predictions of dilute solution theory, so that
αs = O(λD/L) remains small up to rather high volt-
ages. Since the calculation above over-estimates the im-
portance of surface conduction, it is clear that steric ef-
fects also greatly reduce the Dukhin number compared
to the predictions of dilute solution theory. We conclude
that surface conduction in a thin diﬀuse layer does not
become important until voltages large enough to violate
the equivalent circuit approximation are applied across
it. Compact layer surface conduction may still be im-
portant in some cases, but it too is limited by the same
steric eﬀects.

V. COMPACT LAYER EFFECTS

We now check the robustness of these conclusions to
the additional presence of an insulating surface layer be-
tween the metal electrode and the electrolyte where the
EDL models are applied. We suppose that this layer is
not involved in the dynamics so that its properties do not
change, and assume for the sake of simplicity that these
properties are linear so that it can be described as a ﬁxed
surface capacitance Cs.

Such models have been used in many circumstances,
sometimes to describe the Stern layer corresponding to
condensed ions. Our approach here is diﬀerent in the
sense that a layer of condensed ions would be involved in
the charging/discharging process. What we have in mind
is closer to a thin ﬁlm, e.g. of oxide on the metal, of thick-
ness hs and dielectric constant ǫs so that Cs = ǫs/hs.
This form has been proposed to model coating layers on
electrodes in the context of AC electrokinetics [1].

The overall diﬀerential capacitance of the interface is

1
C

=

1
CD

+

1
CS

with CS = dq/dΨS, where q is the total charge per area in
the double layer, and ΨS is the voltage drop across the
aforementioned compact layer. The total voltage drop
across the interface is Ψ = ΨS + ΨD, and q/Ψ is the
total capacitance of the interface.

A useful dimensionless parameter to quantify the ef-
fect of this surface layer is δ = ε/(λDCS), which has
been employed recently in general studies of diﬀuse-
charge dynamics [6, 16], as well as in theoretical mod-
els [1, 5, 40, 58, 78, 92] and in the ﬁtting of exper-
imental data [57, 77] for induced-charge (AC or DC)
electrokinetics. No surface layer corresponds to δ = 0.
In the above mentioned picture of the layer of oxide,
δ = (ε/ǫs)(hs/λD) so that even very thin oxide layers
can yield not too small values of δ if ε/ǫs is large.

Let us now compare the diﬀerential capacitance C
(with surface layer) to the bare double layer diﬀerential
capacitance previously plotted in Fig.7, for the PB equa-
tion and the two models with steric eﬀects. The corre-
sponding plots are provided on Fig.10 for δ = 0.25.

Many qualitative points are obvious. First, the PB
diﬀerential capacitance does not blow up exponentially
anymore, as the surface layer takes over when the double
layer voltage gets large, so that C converges to the ﬁnite
value Cs within the PB model. Most of the potential
drop is then across the surface layer. Second, the two
main consequences of steric eﬀects pointed above remain
valid: C is weaker when steric eﬀects are taken into ac-
count, and C(Ψ) is nonmonotonous with a maximum at
intermediate values and a further decrease to zero.

When the parameter δ is zero or small(i.e. the Stern
layer capacitance is large), a closely packed ”diﬀuse”
layer has to form in response to a high potential drop.

FIG. 11: The diﬀerential capacitance C of the double layer as
a function of potential diﬀerence Ψ for various values of Stern
layer capacitance values.

This is the case when the steric eﬀects become impor-
tant and the PB theory fails. However, for the higher
values of δ, most of the potential drop is realized over
the Stern layer, and the ions in the diﬀuse layer are not
as densely packed. Thus the system stays below the steric
limit, and the PB theory agrees with the MPB theory, as
demonstrated by the total capacitance plots of Fig. 11.
Similar comments can be made on Fig.10, which shows
that for δ = 0.25, steric eﬀects may or may not be impor-
tant depending on value of the dimensionless parameter
ν = 2a3c0. For the distribution of the voltage drop over

drop is on the order of a few voltages.

the Stern layer and the diﬀuse layers, see Fig.12.

This analysis, although correct,

is somewhat mis-
leading, however, since the assumption of a constant
compact-layer capacitance may not always be reason-
able. In many situations of interest, where several volts
(
100kT /e) are applied across the double layer, it is
≈
unlikely that the compact layer could withstand a signif-
icant fraction of the total voltage. Note that dielectric
breakdown in water can occur in average ﬁelds as low as
20 MV/m = 0.02 V/nm in experiments applying submi-
crosceond voltage pulses (well below the charging time of
the double layers) [51]. The critical ﬁeld may be higher
in the Stern layer, where water is conﬁned by ions at the
outer Helmholtz plane [13], but it seems implausible for
an atomic layer to sustain several volts without some-
how “short circuiting” via electron cascades, electrolysis,
Faradaic reactions, etc. In some cases, the compact layer
models a dielectric thin ﬁlm, which may be considerably
thicker. Again, however, most coating materials, such as
teﬂon or various metal oxides, undergo dielectric break-
down in ﬁelds of order 10 MV/m, so a dielectric coating
cannot easily withstand several volts unless it is at least
10 nm wide.

In general, we see that the capacitance of the compact
layer must eﬀectively decrease at large voltages, which
0. As a result, a signﬁcant
corresponds to the limit δ
→
fraction of a large voltage must be sustained by the dif-
fuse layer, making steric eﬀects important in many situa-
tions of interest. Regardless of the accuracy of our simple
models, therefore, we believe that the predicted qualita-
tive eﬀects of ion crowding are likely to have broad rele-
vance for experimental systems applying large voltages.

VI. CONCLUSION

We have used two simple models for the double layer to
account for crowding eﬀects which necessarily take place
at intermediate and large applied voltages. These mod-
els are both based on modiﬁcations of the Poisson Boltz-
mann description of dilute solutions. This strategy has
lead us to identify important operational consequences of
these crowding eﬀects the thin double layers, namely a
largely reduced double layer capacitance and a decreased
ion uptake from the bulk.

We have provided in these sections explicit formulas
for the total and diﬀerential capacitance and for the salt
uptake of interfaces at equilibrium, as a function of the
potential drop across the interface. More precisely we
have recalled the PB results (no steric eﬀects ν = 0), and
given results for the two simple models with steric eﬀects
= 0), considering for all cases the possibility of a ﬁnite
(ν
insulating layer on the electrode (δ

= 0).

The two models lead to remarkably similar results sug-
gesting that these semi-quantitatively hold beyond the
speciﬁcs of these models. Both showed marked diﬀer-

15

ences with the PB approach: the diﬀerential capacitance
and salt uptake are much weaker, and the former varies
non-monotonously with the applied potential.

These observations for the equilibrium properties have
led us to make predictions for the dynamics of electrolyte
cells of size quite larger than the Debye length: (i) an ef-
fective equivalent RC circuit description holds for a wider
range of potentials than expected on the simple basis of
the PB equation, (ii) the response time is much smaller
than expected from PB at large voltages, (iii) this time
decreases at large voltages after an initial increase for
lower values.

The dramatic eﬀect of steric constraints in this prob-
lem also shows that other predictions of nonlinear PB
such as the change of scaling from V 2 to
theory,
for AC electro-osmosis [58], are limited in ap-

plicability and should be revisited with models taking
crowding eﬀects into account. More generally, this work
suggests that, beyond the present problem of ionic trans-
port in electrolytic systems, the description of electroki-
netic eﬀects at large applied voltages should be revisited
to correct shortcomings of dilute-solution theory.

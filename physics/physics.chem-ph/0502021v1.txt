We prove the existence of the exact density-functional theory formalism for open electronic sys-
tems, and develop subsequently an exact time-dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT) for-
mulation for the dynamic response. The TDDFT formulation depends in principle only on the
electron density of the reduced system. Based on the nonequilibrium Green’s function technique,
it is expressed in the form of the equation of motion for the reduced single-electron density ma-
trix, and this provides thus an eﬃcient numerical approach to calculate the dynamic properties of
open electronic systems. In the steady-state limit, the conventional ﬁrst-principles nonequilibrium
Green’s function formulation for the current is recovered.

Density-functional theory (DFT) has been widely used
as a research tool in condensed matter physics, chemistry,
materials science, and nanoscience. The Hohenberg-
Kohn theorem [1] lays the foundation of DFT. The Kohn-
Sham formalism [2] provides the practical solution to
calculate the ground state properties of electronic sys-
tems. Runge and Gross extended further DFT to calcu-
late the time-dependent properties and hence the excited
state properties of any electronic systems [3]. The accu-
racy of DFT or TDDFT is determined by the exchange-
correlation functional. If the exact exchange-correlation
functional were known, the Kohn-Sham formalism would
have provided the exact ground state properties, and
the Runge-Gross extension, TDDFT, would have yielded
the exact properties of excited states. Despite of their
wide range of applications, DFT and TDDFT have been
mostly limited to closed systems.

Fundamental progress has been made in the ﬁeld of
molecular electronics recently. DFT-based simulations
on quantum transport through individual molecules at-
tached to electrodes oﬀer guidance for the design of prac-
tical devices [4, 5, 6]. These simulations focus on the
steady-state currents under the bias voltages. Two types
of approaches have been adopted. One is the Lippmann-
Schwinger formalism by Lang and coworkers [7]. The
other is the ﬁrst-principles nonequilibrium Green’s func-
tion technique [8, 9, 10, 11, 12].
In both approaches
the Kohn-Sham Fock operator is taken as the eﬀective
single-electron model Hamiltonian, and the transmission
coeﬃcients are calculated within the noninteracting elec-
tron model.
It is thus not clear whether the two ap-
proaches are rigorous. Recently Stefanucci and Almbladh
derived an exact expression for time-dependent current
in the framework of TDDFT [13]. In the steady-current
limit, their expression leads to the conventional ﬁrst-
principles nonequilibrium Green’s function formalism if
the TDDFT exchange-correlation functional is adopted.
However, they did not provide a feasible numerical formu-

lation for simulating the transient response of molecular
electronic devices. In this communication, we present a
rigorous ﬁrst-principles formulation to calculate the dy-
namic properties of open electronic systems. We prove
ﬁrst a theorem that the electron density distribution of
the reduced system determines all physical properties or
processes of the entire system. The theorem lays down
the foundation of the ﬁrst-principles method for open sys-
tems. We present then the equation of motion (EOM) for
nonequilibrium Green’s functions (NEGF) in the frame-
work of TDDFT. By introducing a new functional for
the interaction between the reduced system and the en-
vironment, we develop further a reduced-single-electron-
density-matrix-based TDDFT formulation. Finally, we
derive an exact expression for the current which leads
to the existing DFT-NEGF formula in the steady-state
limit. This shows that the conventional DFT-NEGF for-
malism can be exact so long as the correct exchange-
correlation functional is adopted.

Both Hohenberg-Kohn theorem and Runge-Gross ex-
tension apply to isolated systems. Applying Hohenberg-
Kohn-Sham’s DFT and Runge-Gross’s TDDFT to open
systems requires in principle the knowledge of the elec-
tron density distribution of the total system which con-
sists of the reduced system and the environment. This
presents a major obstacle in simulating the dynamic pro-
cesses of open systems. Our objective is to develop an
exact DFT formulation for open systems.
In fact, we
are interested only in the physical properties and pro-
cesses of the reduced system. The environment provides
the boundary conditions and serves as the current source
and energy sink. We thus concentrate on the reduced
system.

Any electron density distribution function ρ(r) of a
real physical system is a real analytic function. We may
treat nuclei as point charges, and this would only lead to
non-analytic electron density at isolated points. In prac-
tical quantum mechanical simulations, analytic functions
such as Gaussian functions and plane wave functions are
adopted as basis sets, which results in analytic electron
density distribution. Therefore, we conclude that any
electron density functions of real systems are real ana-

lytic on connected physical space. Based on this, we show
below that for a real physical system the electron density
distribution function on a sub-space determines uniquely
its values on the entire physical space. This is nothing
but the analytic continuation of a real analytic function.
The proof for the univariable real analytical functions can
be found in textbooks, for instance, reference [14]. The
extension to the multivariable real analytical functions is
straightforward.

Lemma: The electron density distribution function
ρ(r) is real analytic on a connected physical space U .
W ⊆ U is a sub-space. If ρ(r) is known for all r ∈ W ,
ρ(r) can be uniquely determined on entire U .

Proof: To facilitate our discussion, the following nota-
tions are introduced. Set Z+ = {0, 1, 2, . . .}, and γ is an
element of (Z+)3, i.e., γ = (γ1, γ2, γ3) ∈ (Z+)3. The dis-
placement vector r is denoted by the three-dimensional
variable x = (x1, x2, x3) ∈ U . Denote that γ ! =

Suppose that another density distribution function
ρ′(x) is real analytic on U and equal to ρ(x) for all
∂xγ = ∂γ ρ
x ∈ W . We have ∂γ ρ(x)
for all x ∈ W and
γ ∈ (Z+)3. Taking a point x0 at or inﬁnitely close
to the boundary of W , we may expand ρ(x) and ρ(x′)
(x − x0)γ
around x0, i.e., ρ(x) =

(x − x0)γ. Assuming
∂xγ
that the convergence radii for the Taylor expansions of
ρ(x) and ρ′(x) at x0 are both larger than a positive ﬁ-
nite real number b, we have thus ρ(x) = ρ′(x) for all x ∈
Db(x0) = {x : |x − x0| < b} since ∂γ ρ(x)
.
x0
Therefore, the equality ρ′(x) = ρ(x) has been expanded
beyond W to include Db(x0). Since U is connected the
above procedure can be repeated until ρ′(x) = ρ(x) for
all x ∈ U .

We have thus proven that ρ can be uniquely deter-
mined on U once it is known on W , and are ready to
prove the following theorem.

Theorem: Electron density function ρ(r) for a sub-
system of a connected real physical system determines
uniquely all electronic properties of the entire system.

Proof: Assuming the physical space spanned by the
subsystem and the real physical system are W and U ,
respectively. W is thus a sub-space of U , i.e., W ⊆ U .
According to the above lemma, ρ(r) on W determines
uniquely its values on U , i.e., ρ(r) of the subsystem de-
termines ρ(r) of the entire system.

Hohenberg-Kohn theorem and Runge-Gross extension
state that the electron density distribution of a system
determines uniquely all its electronic properties. There-
fore, we conclude that ρ(r) for a subsystem determines
all the electronic properties of the real physical system.
The above theorem guarantees the existence of an ex-
act DFT-type method for open systems. In principle, all
we need to know is the electron density of the reduced
system. The electron density distribution in the environ-

ment can be obtained by the analytic continuation of the
electron density function at or near the boundary. The
challenge is to develop a practical ﬁrst-principles method.

Fig. 1 depicts one type of open systems, a molecular
device. It consists of the reduced system or device region
D and the environment, the left and right electrodes L
and R. Taking this as an example, we develop an ex-
act DFT formalism for the open systems. To calculate
the properties of a molecular device, we need only the
electron density distribution in the device region. The
inﬂuence of the electrodes can be determined by the elec-
tron density distribution in the device region. Within the
TDDFT formulation, we proceed to derive the EOM for
the lesser Green’s function:

such as [8] or [17], and hnl(t) is the Kohn-Sham Fock ma-

for the open electronic systems. However, G<
nm(t, t′) and
Ga
lm(τ, t′) are the two-time Green’s functions. It is thus
extremely time-consuming to solve Eq. (2) numerically.
Alternative must be sought.

Yokojima et al. developed a dynamic mean-ﬁeld the-
ory for dissipative interacting many-electron systems [18].
An EOM for the reduced single-electron density matrix

was derived to simulate the excitation and nonradiative
relaxation of a molecule embedded in a thermal bath.
This is in analogy to our case although our environment
is actually a fermion bath instead of a boson bath. The
major diﬀerence is that the number of electrons in the
reduced system is conserved in reference [18] while in our
case it is not. Note that the reduced single-electron den-
sity matrix σ is actually the lesser Green’s function of
identical time variables,

Eq. (4) is not self-closed since the Gs are to be solved.
According to the theorem we proved earlier, all physi-
cal quantities are explicit or implicit functionals of the
electron density in D, ρD(t). Gs and Σs are thus also
universal functionals of ρD(t). Therefore, we can recast

Neglecting the second term on the RHS of Eq. (7) leads
to the conventional TDDFT formulation in terms of re-
duced single-electron density matrix [19]. The second
term describes the dissipative processes where electrons
enter and leave the region D. Besides the exchange-
correlation functional, the additional universal density
functional Qα[ρD(t)] is introduced to account for the dis-
sipative interaction between the reduced system and its
environment. Eq. (7) is thus the TDDFT formulation in
terms of the reduced single-electron matrix for the open
system. In the frozen DFT approach [20] an additional
exchange-correlation functional term was introduced to
account for the exchange-correlation interaction between
the system and the environment. This additional term is
included in h[ρD(t)] of Eq. (7). Admittedly, Qα[ρD(t)]
can be an extremely complex functional. Progressive
approximations are needed for the practical solution of
Eq. (7). Compared to Eq. (2), Eq. (7) may be much more
convenient to be solved numerically.

To obtain the steady-state solution of Eqs. (4) or (7),
we adopt a similar strategy as that of reference [13].
As t, τ → +∞, Γkα
m,kα(τ ) becomes
asymptotically time-independent, and Gs and Σs rely
simply on the diﬀerence of the two time-variables [13].
The expression for the steady-state current is thus as fol-
lows,

Here T (ǫ) is the transmission coeﬃcient, f α(ǫ) is the
k∈α δ(ǫ − εα
Fermi distribution function, and ηα(ǫ) =
k )
is the density of states for the lead α (L or R). Eq. (8) is
exactly the Landauer formula [21, 22] in the DFT-NEGF
formalism [8, 9]. The only diﬀerence is that Eq. (8) is
derived within the TDDFT formalism in our case while
it is evaluated within the DFT framework in the case of
the DFT-NEGF formulation [8, 9]. In other words, the
DFT-NEGF formalism can be exact so long as the cor-
rect exchange-correlation functional is used! This is not
surprising, and is simply a consequence of that (i) DFT
and TDDFT can yield the exact electron density and (ii)
the current is the time derivative of the total charge.

Just as the exchange-correlation functional, the ex-
act functional form of Qα on density is rather diﬃcult
to derive. Various approximated expressions have been
adopted for the DFT exchange-correlation functional in
the practical implementation. Similar strategy can be

employed for Qα. One such scheme is the wide-band
limit (WBL) approximation [17], which consists of a se-
ries of approximations imposed on the leads: (i) their
band-widths are assumed to be inﬁnitely large, (ii) their
k )Γkα(t, τ ) are re-
linewidths Λα
k (t, τ ) deﬁned by πηα(εα
garded as energy independent, i.e., Λα
k (t, τ ) ≈ Λα(t, τ ) ≈
Λα, and (iii) the energy shifts are taken as level indepen-
dent, i.e., δεα
k (t) ≈ δεα(t) ≈ δεα for L or R. The physical
essence of the transport problem is captured under these
reasonable hypotheses [17]. In the practical implemen-
tation, the eﬀects of the speciﬁc electronic structures of
the leads can be captured by enlarging the device region
to include enough portions of the electrodes.

Following the WBL approximation in reference [17],

we obtain that

Qα =

Eqs. (10)−(12) constitute the WBL formulation of the
TDDFT-NEGF formalism. Although its explicit func-
tional dependency is not given, Qα depends implicitly
on ρD via Eqs. (10)−(12).

To summarize, we have proven the existence of the ex-
act TDDFT formalism for the open electronic systems,
and have proposed a TDDFT-NEGF formulation to cal-
culate the quantum transport properties of molecular
devices. Since TDDFT results in formally exact den-
sity distribution, the TDDFT-NEGF formulation is in
principle an exact theory to evaluate the transient and
steady-state currents. In particular, the TDDFT-NEGF
expression for the steady-state current has the exact same
form as that of the conventional DFT-NEGF formal-
ism [8, 9, 10, 11, 12], and this provides rigorous the-
oretical foundation for the existing DFT-based method-
ologies [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12] calculating the steady currents
through molecular devices.

In addition to the conventional exchange-correlation
functional, a new density functional is introduced to ac-
count for the dissipative interaction between the reduced
system and the environment. In the WBL approxima-
tion, the new functional can be expressed in a relatively
simple form which depends implicitly on the electron den-
sity of the reduced system. Since the basic variable in our
formulation is the reduce single-electron density matrix,
the linear-scaling techniques such as that of reference [19]
can be adopted to further speed up the computation.

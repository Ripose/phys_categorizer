Monte Carlo simulations using a hybrid quantum and classical mechanical potential were

performed for crystal and amorphous-like HCl(H2O)n clusters (n ≤ 24). The subsystem

composed by HCl and one water molecule was treated within Density Functional Theory,

and a classical force ﬁeld was used for the rest of the system. Simulations performed at

200 K suggest that the energetic feasibility of HCl dissociation strongly depends on its

initial placement within the cluster. An important degree of ionization occurs only if HCl

is incorporated into the surface. We observe that local melting does not play a crucial role

in the ionization process.

1 Introduction

Atmospheric chemistry is a research area in which many relevant processes occur in het-

erogeneous environments, such as the surface of solid particles and within liquid droplets.

In particular, investigations connected with the stratospheric ozone layer have proved that

ionic solvation of HCl at the surface of ice crystals is an important source of chlorine atoms,

which may ultimately induce ozone-destroying chain reactions [1, 2, 3].

Simulations of HCl dissociation at ice surfaces using classical force ﬁelds have recently

been reported [4, 5]. These are based on parametrizations of the potential energy surface

which are derived from gas phase calculations for the isolated HCl(H2O) dimer and the
ionic complex Cl− + H3O+. Situations like those described above, in which a chemical re-

action is strongly inﬂuenced by the environment, are rather delicate, and a purely classical

approach risks of exhibiting problems of potentials transferability. A quantum mechanical

semiempirical study has also been reported for HCl solvated in water clusters [6]. This

calculation does take into account in a better way the eﬀects of the environment, but it

shows a very poor performance for the isolated HCl-acceptor water subsystem. This is a

consequence of the limitations of the semiempirical description of the quantum mechani-

cal Hamiltonian. Full ab initio Car-Parrinello simulations of HCl dissociation have been

performed, although in a bulk water environment [7].

In order to use an accurate electronic structure technique and be able to sample ade-

quately conﬁguration space at an aﬀordable computational cost, we have devised a hybrid

approach [8, 9] in which the HCl-acceptor water subsystem is treated at the Density Func-

tional Theory (DFT) level [10] and the rest of the system is modeled using the TIP4P

potential for water [11]. We have also analyzed the role of the initial conditions and the

local melting on the energetic feasibility of HCl dissociation in crystal-like and amorphous-

like clusters HCl(H2O)n (n ≤ 24) at a temperature of 200 K using Monte Carlo simulation

techniques.

2 The hybrid QM/CM strategy

The computational scheme is constructed by partitioning the system into a quantum me-

chanical (QM) and a classical mechanical (CM) region [8]. Considering Nc atoms in the

classical subsystem with coordinates and partial charges {Ri, qi, i = 1, · · · , Nc} and Nq

atoms in the QM region with coordinates and nuclear charges {τα, zα, α = 1, · · · , Nq} the

total energy can be written as:

E[ρ] = EKS[ρ] +

In this equation the ﬁrst term is a purely quantum mechanical piece given by the standard

Kohn-Sham expression [12]. The electronic density ρ is obtained by solving a Kohn-Sham

set of equations self-consistently, where the external potential contribution to the Kohn-

Sham operator includes the electrostatic interaction with the CM region, as given by the

second and third terms of expression (1). The second term accounts for the electrostatic

interaction of the charges representing the atoms (or molecules) situated in the CM region

with the electronic charge distribution, while the third term corresponds to the Van der

Waals and electrostatic interactions between the nuclei in the CM region and those in the

QM region. TIP4P parameters [11] were used for O and H, and Lennard-Jones parameters

for Cl were taken from [13]. The last term, ECM , is the classical solvent contribution,

and has been modeled with a ﬂexible TIP4P potential for water which includes harmonic

stretching and bending intramolecular terms extracted from extensive ab initio calcula-

tions [14]. The electrostatic interactions between nuclei in the QM region are included in

the Kohn-Sham expression (ﬁrst term).

For the QM region, computations are performed at the generalized gradient approximation

(GGA) level. The correlation part is composed by the parametrization of the homogeneous

electron gas due to Vosko [15] and the gradient corrections given by Perdew [16]. The local

exchange term was supplemented with the gradient corrections proposed by Becke [17].

The exchange-correlation contribution to the potential and the energy is calculated by a

numerical integration scheme based on grids and quadratures also proposed by Becke [18].

Gaussian basis sets are used for the expansion of the one-electron orbitals and also for

3

the additional auxiliary set used for expanding the electronic density. Double zeta plus

polarization basis sets have been employed for Cl, O and H [19]. Auxiliary sets were also

taken from Ref. [19].

In order to check the accuracy of the QM part of the Hamiltonian, geometry optimiza-

tions and vibrational analysis have been performed for isolated HCl, H2O and HCl(H2O).

Structural results are shown in Table 1, together with results recently obtained at the MP2

level [20]. The agreement between DFT-GGA and MP2 results as well as with available

experimental data is rather satisfactory. This is consistent with previous work [21, 22] in

which DFT calculations at the GGA level proved to perform well for hydrogen-bonded

dimers.

The performance of the QM/CM approach was tested by computing the binding ener-

gies, structural parameters and vibrational frequencies of the clusters HCl(H2O)n (n=2,3),

considering the subsystem formed by HCl and the acceptor water molecule as the QM sub-

system, and the remaining water molecules as the CM part. For these clusters, MP2 and

also some experimental results are available. Selected structural parameters are shown in

Table 1. The agreement with the MP2 computed values is again reasonable. An increase of

the HCl and a decrease of the OCl bond length with cluster size can be observed, implying

that the H-bond strength increases with the number of water molecules in the cluster.

Binding energies and the νHCl vibrational stretching frequencies for HCl(H2O)n (n=2,3)

are reported in Table 2, compared with experimental data and MP2 results. A red shift

in the HCl stretching frequency is experimentally observed upon complexation with water

molecules, and reproduced by theoretical calculations. This implies that proton transfer is

increasingly favored in larger clusters. Interaction energies for the HCl(H2O) complex show

a good agreement with MP2 calculations. Results for larger clusters show an overestimation

of binding energies seemingly because of the use of a TIP4P classical potential parametrized

for bulk water. However, the errors are expected to become less important for larger

aggregates, as one approaches the bulk situation.

3 Monte Carlo simulations

Finite temperature properties were simulated using a Monte Carlo (MC) technique [27].

The MC moves consisted of random changes in the positions of all the particles simultane-

ously (including intramolecular solvent motions), with maximum displacements indepen-

dent of their respective masses. The standard Metropolis sampling algorithm was used [28],

and the maximum displacements were adjusted to give an overall acceptance ratio of about

50%. Ensemble averages were calculated over 15000 trial moves in all cases, after 4000

moves of equilibration. All simulations were carried out at 200 K, a temperature which is

characteristic of stratospheric conditions.

We have considered the following situations:

1. HCl(H2O), hereafter referred as Case 1.

2. HCl(H2O)16 amorphous-like clusters. The initial conditions for these clusters have

been obtained by running classical MC simulations at 200 K, in which the structure

of the HCl(H2O) dimer was constrained during the course of the simulation. This
was achieved by ﬁxing the HCl bond length to 1.34 ˚A(Case 2A) and 1.90 ˚A(Case

2B), respectively.

In case 2A, the HCl molecule remained at the periphery of the

cluster, while in case 2B it was incorporated into the surface.

3. HCl(H2O)24 crystal-like clusters. The initial conditions were generated by isolating

a fragment of two bilayers of hexagonal ice, composed by 25 water molecules, and

replacing an appropriately oriented water molecule with an HCl. In the ﬁrst case we

replaced a water molecule situated in the outer layer (case 3A). In the second and

third cases, the water molecule replaced was selected in the second layer (cases 3B

and 3C). In case 3B, the orientation of the HCl molecule was chosen such that it

was H-bonded to a water acceptor molecule located in the ﬁrst layer, while in case

3C the HCl was H-bonded to a water molecule located in the second layer. These

are typical conﬁgurations that are likely to be found during the ice growth process

under stratospheric conditions [4].

5

Schematic views for cases 1, 2A, and 2B are shown in Figure 1, and for cases 3A, 3B, and

3C in Figure 2.

Radial distribution functions g(r) for H-Cl, H-O(acceptor water) and Cl-O(acceptor water)

are presented in Figure 3 for cases 1, 2A, and 2B and in Figure 4 for cases 3A, 3B and 3C.

It can be observed that an important extent of ionization occurs in cases 2B, 3B and 3C,

i.e. in those situations where the HCl is incorporated into the surface, instead of remaining

as an adsorbate. The degree of ionization, however, is not complete. This can be seen in
the ﬁrst peak of g(r) for H-O(acceptor water), which lies at about 1.2 – 1.3 ˚A, while the
optimized HO bond distance in [H3O]+ is about 1.0 ˚A.

It can be observed in Figure 3 that no ionization occurs in case 2A, where the HCl peak

in the g(r) remains at about the equilibrium distance of the isolated HCl molecule. The

diﬀerent behavior observed in cases 2A and 2B can be explained in terms of the solvation
[H3O]+ prefers

of the products, which is determined basically by the initial conditions.

trigonal coordination, and situations in which it acts as an acceptor in H-bonds are un-
favorable. On the other hand, Cl− prefers maximum H coordination. In case 2B, [H3O]+

would be trigonally coordinated as well as the chloride ion, but in case 2A the chlorine is

found in the periphery of the cluster and solvation is rather poor.

Figure 4 shows that there is no dissociation in case 3A. This is because Cl results with
only coordination 2 and [H3O]+ would act as an acceptor of an H bond (tetrahedral coor-

dination). In both 3B and 3C cases dissociation occurs. The larger degree of ionization

observed in Case 3B is due to the fact that, while Cl always exhibits a trigonal coordina-
tion, in case 3C the [H3O]+ is tetrahedrally solvated, and in 3B it has the optimal trigonal

coordination. It is also interesting to remark the diﬀerent behavior observed for the g(r)

for O-Cl in the diﬀerent simulations. In the case in which HCl is in the outer layer (case
3A), it peaks at about 3.00 ˚A and in cases in which it is in the second monolayer (3B
and 3C), it peaks at 2.76 ˚A and 2.77 ˚A, respectively. The same trend is observed in the

amorphous-like clusters (2A and 2B), for which g(r) peaks at a larger value when HCl is

not dissociated.

Ensemble averages for Cl Mulliken population, H-Cl, H-O(acceptor water), Cl-O(acceptor

water) distances and binding energies are given in Table 3. More negative averages for

the Cl Mulliken populations are consistent with the large degree of dissociation observed

in cases 2B, 3B and 3C. It can also be noted that larger average binding energies per

molecule are associated with the better solvated (larger extent of ionization) situations. In

all simulations the clusters remained solid-like, at least in the region of phase space sampled

during our simulations. Values of Lindemann’s relative rms bond length ﬂuctuations were

typically 0.02. Melting phenomena have not been observed, even in the simulations with

an important degree of dissociation.

4 Conclusions

We conclude that the energetic feasibility for HCl ionization in solid-like clusters strongly

depends on the initial placement of the HCl within the system, which in turn determines

the solvation properties of the products. Local melting phenomena turn out not to be

necessarily related to the dissociation process. Our results on crystal-like clusters reinforce

the conclusions of Ref. [4], in which simulations of HCl incorporated into bulk-ice surfaces

were performed using classical potentials. Moreover, we have shown that the same conclu-

sion holds for amorphous-like clusters. In the case of HCl adsorbed on top of ice surfaces it

appears that the HCl dissociation process would not be energetically favorable [5]. These

observations also show that the accuracy of the Hamiltonian description plays a funda-

mental role in these studies. The QM/CM Monte Carlo scheme proposed in this work

provides an accurate tool for modeling chemical reactions in heterogeneous environments.

Before closing this article, we would like to make a ﬁnal comment concerning ergodicity and

proper sampling of all relevant ﬂuctuations. During our MC runs the systems remained

well-equilibrated and we did not observe any signature of transitions between the diﬀerent

solvation structures described in the previous paragraphs. This clearly shows the presence

7

of a high free energy barrier - in comparison to normal thermal energies - implying that,

in principle, the feasibility of the dissociation process would be strongly dependent on the

initial solvation conditions, i.e. on the details of the growth process. In any event, one

would tend to believe that the more energetically favorable conﬁguration, namely the one

with the larger negative solvation energy (2B or 3B in our studies, see Table 3) would cor-

respond to the most stable conﬁguration from the thermodynamic point of view. However

to be certain, a more complete analysis involving the computation of relative free energies

between the diﬀerent solvation structures is necessary; this would allow us to estimate not

only equilibrium information but also information about rates of interconvertion between

diﬀerent solvation structures. Work in this direction is currently being undertaken.

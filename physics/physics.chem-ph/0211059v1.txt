solutions: Diﬀusion and structural properties

In this paper we compare diﬀerent force ﬁelds that are widely used (Gromacs, Charmm-22/x-plor,
Charmm-27, Amber-1999, OPLS-AA) in biophysical simulations containing aqueous NaCl. We show
that the uncertainties of the microscopic parameters of, in particular, sodium and, to a lesser extent,
chloride translate into large diﬀerences in the computed radial-distribution functions. We discuss
possible implications on the computation of potential of mean force and eﬀective potentials.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The presence of water is characteristic to all biological
systems. For any simulational study of biophysical phe-
nomena, a proper description of water is a necessity. It is
widely known that modelling water is a diﬃcult task, and
due to this many diﬀerent models have been developed.
In addition to water, the description ions, in particular
Na+ and Cl−, is essential for biophysical systems. A sim-
ple example is the physiological liquid in the human body
containing about 0.8 mol salt, i.e., of the order of one ion
pair per 100 water molecules.

Today, virtually all simulations use one of the water
models either from the TIP or the SPC series, a recent
review of water models is provided by Wallqvist and
Mountain [1]. For water, the inﬂuence of aspects such
as density, treatment of long-range electrostatics and the
choice of force-ﬁeld have been studied intensively, see e.g.
Ref. 2 for a recent study. However, no systematic stud-
ies, to the authors’ knowledge, exist for ionic force ﬁelds.
On one hand that is very surprising since various studies
indicate that the force ﬁeld can have a signiﬁcant eﬀect
on the system properties even in the case of an implicit
solvent [3]. In addition, it also known from experiments
that the properties of ionic solutions may be signiﬁcantly
inﬂuenced even by small amounts of heavy isotopes of the
ions [4].

On the other hand, a practical obstacle for a system-
atic comparison has been the evaluation of long-range
electrostatics. In the past, there has been much work to
include the eﬀects of Coulombic interactions [5, 6, 7, 8, 9,
10, 11, 12, 13] without performing the computationally
costly Ewald summations. Present day computational
resources allow one to treat electrostatics properly, how-
ever [14].

In this article we compare various commonly used
force ﬁelds and a parametrisation for sodium chloride in
combination with diﬀerent commonly used water mod-
els. For NaCl we used Gromacs, Charmm-22/x-plor,
Charmm-27, Amber-1999 and OPLS-AA force ﬁelds, and
the parametrisation by Smith and Dang [15]. The water
models used for the aqueous solution were SPC, SPC/E,
TIP3P and TIP4P. In previous studies some static prop-
erties such as radial distribution functions have been
studied, but in each case for one particular choice of force

ﬁeld only [6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 13, 16]. In addition, the eﬀects
of temperature [17] and salt concentration [18] have re-
cently been studied. To our knowledge, there is no sys-
tematic study regarding the eﬀects of the force ﬁeld and
this study aims to ﬁll that gap.

When developing empirical force ﬁelds, one matches
certain experimental quantities with their counterparts
as determined by a numerical simulations. The choice is
determined by the availability of high quality experimen-
tal data and the physical signiﬁcance of that quantity.
The parameters of a force ﬁeld thus depend critically on
the choice of quantities that are being compared. Force
ﬁelds are typically optimised for macroscopic parameters
like the solvation enthalpy (i. e., placing an ion into a
shell of water should give the same lowering of energy in
the simulation as in an experiment) that are important
thermodynamic quantities and at the same time can be
measured to a high accuracy.

Structural properties are important in force ﬁeld de-
velopment for coarse-grained systems [19, 20]. A natural
way to quantify them is by using distribution functions
of which the radial-distribution function g(r) is the most
commonly used, where r =
~r1
stands for the sep-
aration between particles 1 and 2.
It gives the proba-
bility of ﬁnding two particles at some distance r, taking
account of density and geometric eﬀects, and can be for-
mally related to the potential of mean force between two
particles [21].

II. FORCE FIELDS

In this article we compare diﬀerent force ﬁelds. We
restrict ourselves to force ﬁelds in the traditional sense,
i. e., they have to be available in an electronic form and
cover a wide range of systems. We specify the precise
ﬁles used to obtain the parameters for our simulations.
This information is relevant since often these parameters
vary slightly between diﬀerent sources even for the same
force ﬁeld.

It should be noted that all of the force ﬁelds tested
here were originally developed with the aim of describing
proteins and nucleic acids. Description of ions is thus
only a small part of their capabilities. For comparison,
we have included one hand-optimised set of parameters

for NaCl only [15].

The diﬀerent force ﬁelds and ﬁles are the following:

Gromacs (“GROM”): Force

included
in
ﬁeld
Version 3.1.3 of Gromacs [22].
Available at
http://www.gromacs.org/download/index.php;
ﬁle ffgmxnb.itp. The TIP4P water model for Gro-
macs is available at http://www.gromacs.org/
pipermail/gmx-users/2001-November/
000152.html.
For the systems discussed in
this paper,
i. e., water and NaCl, the Gromacs
force ﬁeld is identical to the Gromos-96 force
ﬁeld. Since Gromacs is the fastest MD program
available, its default force ﬁeld is used increasingly
often.

X-Plor/Charmm-22 (“XPLR”): Force
3.851,

ﬁeld
available
from x-plor
distribution
http://atb.csb.yale.edu/xplor/;
at
ﬁle
parallh22x.pro. While this force-ﬁeld is labelled
the original Charmm-22 force
as Charmm-22,
ﬁeld [23] does not include ions, but they are in-
cluded only in the x-plor distribution. X-plor [24]
is one of the most versatile non-commercial pro-
grams for protein simulations but is only able to
use this force ﬁeld.

Charmm-27 (“CH27”): Available at

https://rxsecure.umaryland.edu/research/
amackere/research.html;
ﬁle par all27 prot lipid.inp.
In comparison
to Charmm-22, the more recent Charmm-27 [25]
contains parameters for ions in the ﬁles available
at the website. Charmm-27 includes also other
improvements for the description nucleic acids. For
proteins, Charmm-22 is identical to Charmm-27.
The Charmm-27 ion parameters are credited to
Refs. 26 and 27.

Amber-1999 (“AMBR”): The complete force ﬁeld
distribution for the Amber-1999 force ﬁeld [28] is
available at http://www.amber.ucsf.edu/amber/
amber7.ffparms.tar.gz. We used parameter
ﬁle parm99.dat and TIP4P water model
from
frcmod.tip4p. New Amber-2002 force ﬁeld in-
cludes explicit polarisation terms, and thus falls
outside the scope of this comparison.

OPLS-AA (“OPLS”): The OPLS-AA force ﬁeld [29]
is the only force-ﬁeld in our list that is not part
of a MD simulation package. Hence, there is no
“oﬃcial” ﬁle with the force ﬁeld parameters. We
chose the one included with Gromacs Version
available at http://www.gromacs.org/
3.1.4,
download/index.php in ﬁle ffoplsaanb.itp.
One should note that other sources exist, e. g.
http://www.scripps.edu/brooks/charmm docs/
oplsaa-toppar.tar.

Smith-1994 (“SMIT”): Hand-optimised set.

lished in Ref. 15.

We performed simulations using the four standard
water models, namely the rigid versions of SPC [30],
SPC/E [31], TIP3P [32, 33] and TIP4P [32]. For com-
putational eﬃciency, we did not use the ﬂexible versions
of the water models. SPC/E and SPC diﬀer only by
the partial charges assigned to the atoms, so that the
Lennard-Jones parameters are identical and thus need to
be speciﬁed only once.

The computer-readable ﬁles from the force ﬁeld distri-
butions typically contain one or more of the above water
models. Whenever a water model was available in this
way, we took the parameters from that ﬁle. Otherwise,
standard parameters were used. This explains the (very)
small diﬀerences than can be seen in Tab. I between dif-
ferent force ﬁeld distributions for the same water model.
The assignment of partial charges for the ions is triv-
ial, and for the diﬀerent water models it is well deﬁned
by the water model. The relevant parameters, since they
are diﬀerent for each force-ﬁeld, thus are the ones describ-
ing Lennard-Jones interactions. They can be speciﬁed in
diﬀerent ways, the two most common ones being

V (r) =

c12
r12 −

c6
r6 = 4ǫ

12

r (cid:17)

(cid:20)(cid:16)

6

σ
r (cid:17)

(cid:21)

,

− (cid:16)

(1)

where the freedom of measuring energy in kcal or kJ re-
mains. In addition, another common practise is not to
specify all interaction parameters explicitly but to use
the Lorentz-Berthelot combination rules
ǫ1 + ǫ2
2

σ = √σ1σ2 ,

ǫ =

(2)

,

where the indices 1 and 2 denote particles of type 1 and
2, respectively. Table I lists the precise Lennard-Jones
parameters used in our simulations. In addition, the ta-
ble also indicates whether the parameter in question was
speciﬁed directly by the force ﬁeld or had to be computed
via Eqs. (1) and/or (2).

In Sec. IV we present the results of our simulations,
and show how the diﬀerent force-ﬁelds diﬀer in their de-
scription of the NaCl properties. One important conclu-
sion can, however, be drawn already from Tab. I: The
parameters for the diﬀerent water models (SPC, TIP3P
and TIP4P) diﬀer only slightly, representing the current
good knowledge of the properties of water. For (aque-
ous) chloride, the diﬀerences are signiﬁcantly larger, up
to 10 % for the radius and up to 50 % for the depth of the
attractive well of the Lennard-Jones interaction, reﬂect-
ing the lack of high quality experimental input data. For
(aqueous) sodium, there seems to be virtually no consen-
sus on its properties. In the simulations, one can thus
expect that the biggest diﬀerences will be in the Na–Na
properties, followed by the Na–Cl interactions.

III. SIMULATIONS

commonly used thermostats, namely Berendsen [34],

TABLE I: Parameters of the Lennard-Jones interactions for diﬀerent force ﬁelds. The typeface of the numbers indicates where
these numbers stem from. Boldface (“1.23”) means that it is explicitly given by the force ﬁeld in the speciﬁed notation.
Underlined numbers (“1.23”) denote that the Lennard-Jones interaction parameters were given explicitly by the force ﬁeld
and a unit conversion (e. g. from kcal to kJ) was necessary. Normal font (“1.23”) means that the parameter in question was
computed via the combination rule Eq. (2). Not all force ﬁelds specify all three water models. In case that one was missing we
have taken the missing parameters (either directly or via the combination rule) from the Gromacs force ﬁeld. This is indicated
by italic font (“1 .23 ”). Hydrogens do not participate in Lennard-Jones interaction, and the symbol after the O for oxygen
stands for the water model (“S” for SPC and SPC/E, “3” for TIP3P, and “4” for TIP4P).

FIG. 1: Diﬀusion coeﬃcients DNa and DCl for sodium and chloride, respectively. Left: Labelling according to the ionic force
ﬁeld. Right: Labelling according to the water model used.

Nos´e-Hoover [35, 36] and Langevin [37]. All of them
are implemented into the Gromacs simulation software
that was used for all of the computations presented in
this paper. The target temperature was set to 298 K
and particle-mesh Ewald (PME) was used for long-range
electrostatics.

For each combination of ionic force-ﬁeld, water model
and thermostat a MD simulation was run. The total
number of simulations added up to 72. A pre-production
analysis showed that the systems needed slightly less
than 0.5 ns to equilibrate. For each simulation run, we
computed a 2 ns trajectory and only the second half of
that was included into the analysis.

The simulations were run at the physiological salt con-
centration of 0.87 mol. The simulation box contained
slightly more than 10000 water molecules so that ﬁnite
size eﬀects are not expected. Lennard-Jones interaction
was cut-oﬀ at 1 nm. The optimal choice for the cutoﬀ
length is not obvious and can vary between force ﬁelds
(even between the ones for the ions and for water in the
same simulation). For consistency, we decided to use the
same cutoﬀ in all simulations. For all of these systems, all
relevant structures are on scales much smaller than 1 nm.
Furthermore, all atoms are charged so that Lennard-
Jones interactions quickly become negligible compared to
electrostatic interactions, and the precise choice of cutoﬀ
does not matter as much as it does for other systems.

The simulations described above presented a signiﬁ-
cant numerical task, and a total of approximately 25 000
hours of cpu time was needed to complete them.

IV. SIMULATION RESULTS

A. Dynamic properties

The most common quantity to describe the dynamical
behaviour of a system is its diﬀusion coeﬃcient D. We
have plotted the results for diﬀerent forceﬁelds and water

models in Fig. 1. The format for this plot, as well as the
following ones, is the following: All results are plotted
twice, using two ﬁgures next to each other. The points
are identical but in the left ﬁgure we have labelled them
according to the ionic force ﬁeld whereas in the right ﬁg-
ure we have labelled them according to the water model
used. This way it is easy to see whether there is any sys-
tematic dependence on the ionic force ﬁeld and/or the
water model.

The results for diﬀusion coeﬃcients using Berendsen
and Nos´e-Hoover were identical within statistical error,
but using Langevin thermostat the diﬀusion coeﬃcients
were much smaller. Unlike the Berendsen and Nos´e-
Hoover thermostats, the Langevin thermostat is not mo-
mentum conserving, and thus we omit the results for the
Langevin thermostat when computing the diﬀusion coef-
ﬁcients.

From Fig. 1 it is clear that the dynamics is determined
by the water model while the ionic contribution is neg-
ligible. This is not surprising since in aqueous systems
the behaviour is dominated by the water molecules as
they outnumber the ions by a factor of order 100. This
is likely to be the case for other dynamic properties as
well. A study of the dynamic properties of water mod-
els is beyond the scope and aim of this paper, and we
refer to previous studies on this subject [1] and to the
very informative webpage [40]. To see the eﬀect of the
ionic force ﬁelds, we concentrate on static properties in
the following.

B. Energy

First, we computed the binding energy between each
ion pair and its environment. Since PME does not al-
low direct computation of single particle contribution to
the potential energy, this quantity was computed by ﬁrst
determining the potential energy of the full simulation.
Then, the potential energy for precisely the same trajec-

tory — with the ions removed — was determined. The
binding energy is then given by the diﬀerence in the ener-
gies of the two states, divided by the number of ion pairs
in the simulation box.

The results for identical force ﬁelds for ions and water
but diﬀerent thermostats were identical within statistical
ﬂuctuations. (This also shows that the simulations are
long enough to sample the phase space.) For this reason,
we do not distinguish between thermostats in the follow-
ing, and rather use the three diﬀerent values to compute
the mean and an error estimate. The results are shown
in Fig. 2. It is seen that there is a systematic dependence
on the choice of force ﬁeld for both ions and water, and
that those diﬀerences are signiﬁcantly outside any error
margin.

The above results should be interpreted with care.
First, by simply removing the ions, the ordering of the
water molecules is kept intact. This energy is thus not
directly related to any experimentally measurable energy.
Furthermore, in experiments enthalpies rather than en-
ergies are measured. In the above we did not include the
entropic contribution. Fig. 2 should be understood as an
indicator of whether diﬀerent force ﬁelds lead to diﬀerent
static properties — and well outside of any error margins
— and they do.

To close this discussion, we want to point out the fol-
lowing curiosity. The error margin consists of a statistical
part and a systematic part, the latter one describing how
much the results depend on the choice of thermostat. The
results indicate that certain force ﬁelds (XPLOR, SMIT)
are much less sensitive than others (GROM, OPLS). The
reason and possible implications are not obvious to us.

restrictions, we focus on the rdf’s between the ions, hence
omitting all rdf’s including water. The complete set of
rdf’s can be found as supplementary material at our web-
site [41].

As already hinted at in Sec. II, the Na–Na interac-
tions display the largest variations. The dependence of
the computed rdf’s on the choice of thermostat is neg-
ligible, i.e., the statistical error of the computed rdf’s is
small and all diﬀerences are due to the force ﬁelds. In
Fig. 3 we present the Na–Na rdf for four diﬀerent force
ﬁeld combinations. (For the complete set, see the sup-
plementary material.) It is immediately obvious that the
rdf’s diﬀer from each other in many aspects, such as the
number of peaks, the relative and absolute heights of the
peaks, and that those diﬀerences are signiﬁcant.

To give a more systematic overview in a condensed
way, we have computed the position and height of the
ﬁrst peak for all rdf’s. For this, a Gaussian is ﬁtted to
the rdf in the neighbourhood of the peak. The results
are depicted in Fig. 4.

FIG. 4: Position and height of the ﬁrst peak of the radial-distribution function for Na–Na (top), Cl–Cl (centre) and Na–Cl
(bottom).

From Fig. 4 it is seen that the Na–Na and Cl–Cl peaks
are scattered widely (Na–Na being scattered more than
Cl–Cl), and that there is no well-deﬁned systematic ten-
dency. We want to point out one interesting fact: While
for the Na–Na and Cl–Cl peaks there is a dependence
both on the ionic force ﬁeld and the water model, the
position of the Na–Cl peaks is independent of the chosen
water model. The reason for this is not obvious.

D. Cluster analysis

Next we discuss the physical background behind the
peaks in the Na–Na and Cl–Cl rdf’s in Fig. 4. Espe-
cially if the peak is signiﬁcantly higher than 1, this means
that ions “like” to be at a certain distances from each
other much more than to be away from each other as
much as possible — even though they are strongly re-
pelling through electrostatic forces.

tions of aqueous ionic systems pairing of chloride ions

was found but it was later realised that this pairing is an
artifact that disappears if long-range electrostatic forces
are treated properly [5, 9, 12].

Such problems can be ruled out here but there still is
the question whether clusters of ions exist. For this rea-
son we have performed a cluster analysis. We deﬁne a
cluster as the set of all ions that are connected by dis-
tances of 0.35 nm or less. From the radial-distribution
functions in Fig. 4 it can be seen that 0.35 nm is a rea-
sonable value, and that the precise choice does not eﬀect
the results.

After doing this, we collected statistics on the number
of ions in each cluster, computing the ratio p(N ) of ions
that belong to a cluster consisting of N ions. In Fig. 5 we

have plotted p(pair)
Since p(cluster) is small, it has a large statistical error.
Thus the results for all force ﬁelds agree within the mar-
gin of error. We conclude that the qualitative diﬀerences
in the rdf’s are due to generic eﬀects and not due to the
formation of clusters.

FIG. 6: Potential of mean force, computed from Eq. (3), for
the same simulations as depicted in Fig. 3.

E.

Implications for the potential of mean force

The radial-distribution function can be used to deﬁne
diﬀerent potentials. The most common one is the poten-
tial of mean force VPMF, deﬁned by

g(r) = exp[

βVPMF(r)] .

(3)

−
Although not immediately visible in the formula, the po-
tential of mean force includes the direct interaction be-
tween two particles at ﬁxed positions, and additionally
the contribution from having a third particle at a ﬁxed
position provided particles 1 and 2 are already ﬁxed [21].
In other words, the potential of mean force includes ﬁrst
order corrections to the pure pairwise potential. In Fig. 6
the computed potential of mean force is depicted for the
simulations shown in Fig. 3. Diﬀerences in g(r) translate
into diﬀerences in VPMF(r).

If higher order corrections are included, a diﬀerent
kind of potential is found, termed eﬀective potential [11].
It can be computed from the radial-distribution func-
tions g(r) in a process known as inverse Monte Carlo
simulation. The eﬀective potentials are used for simula-
tions where some degrees of freedom have been integrated
out [38, 39]. (This integrating out is also called coarse-
graining.) Since the qualitative properties of eﬀective
potentials and the potentials of mean force are known
to be similar, the strong dependence of the potential of
mean force on the force ﬁeld is almost certainly reﬂected
in eﬀective potentials.

V. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper, we have shown that diﬀerent force ﬁelds
for the simulation of aqueous salt solutions lead to signif-
icantly diﬀerent results. In particular, this is the case for
the radial-distribution function describing the structural
properties of the system. As there is no good experi-
mental data available, it is impossible to judge the force

ﬁelds, i. e., it is impossible to tell which force ﬁeld is the
best or which one is the worst. Our analysis should thus
be understood as determining the uncertainties (=lack
of knowledge) of microscopic simulations of ionic aque-
ous solutions. The problem of the signiﬁcant dependence
of the microscopic simulations on the force ﬁeld param-
eters seems to have been largely overlooked when using
the results of such simulations for further studies, such

as the computation of eﬀective potentials.

Abstract

We investigate the possibility of optical current control through single molecules
which are weakly coupled to leads. A master equation approach for the trans-
port through a molecule is combined with a Floquet theory for the time-dependent
molecule. This yields an eﬃcient numerical approach to the evaluation of the cur-
rent through time-dependent nano-structures in the presence of a ﬁnite external
voltage. We propose tunable optical current switching in two- and three-terminal
molecular electronic devices driven by properly adjusted laser ﬁelds, i.e. a novel
class of molecular transistors.

1 Introduction

Spurred by the ongoing experimental progress in the ﬁeld of molecular elec-
tronics [1–5], the theoretical interest in transport properties of molecules has
revived [6]. Tight-binding models for the wire have been used to compute
current-voltage characteristics, within a scattering approach [7] and from elec-
tron transfer theory [6]. Both approaches bear the same essentials [8]. For high
temperatures, the wire electrons loose their quantum coherence and the trans-
port is dominated by incoherent hopping between neighbouring sites [9]. Re-
cently, the current-voltage characteristics has been obtained from a quantum-

chemical ab initio description of the molecule [10]. The results were in good
agreement with recent experiments [5].

Typical electronic excitation energies in molecules are in the range up to an eV
and, thus, correspond to light quanta from the optical and the infrared spec-
tral regime where most of today’s lasers work. It is therefore natural to use
such coherent light sources to excite molecules and to study their inﬂuence
on the transport properties aiming to ﬁnd a way of manipulating currents.
One particularly prominent example of quantum control is the so-called co-
herent destruction of tunnelling (CDT), i.e. the suppression of the tunnelling
dynamics in an isolated bistable potential by the purely coherent inﬂuence
of an oscillating bias [11–15]. The crucial point there is that the long-time
dynamics in a periodically driven quantum system is no longer dominated
by the energies, but rather by the so-called quasienergies [15–17]. The latter
may be degenerate for properly chosen driving parameters yielding a divergent
time-scale. Inspired by these results, we address in this Letter the question of
controlling by use of properly tailored laser ﬁelds the transport through time-
dependent open systems, i.e. systems that allow for a particle exchange with
external leads.

For the computation of electrical currents through wires exposed to strong
laser ﬁelds, we put forward Floquet approach [18]. The central idea of this
method lies in a non-perturbative solution of the Schr¨odinger equation of
the isolated time-dependent wire plus laser ﬁeld, while the wire-lead coupling
is treated perturbatively. The resulting density operator equation is decom-
posed into a time-dependent Floquet basis permitting a numerically eﬃcient
treatment. We generalise here this method to the analysis of networks with
an arbitrary number of contacts to leads. Subsequently we apply the so ob-
tained formalism to the investigation of optical current switching in two- and
three-terminal devices as prototypical examples of a new class of molecular
transistors.

2 Model for wire and leads

We embark by specifying the model Hamiltonian of the entire system as
sketched in Fig. 1. It consists of the molecule in the laser ﬁeld, ideal leads,
and the molecule-leads coupling Hamiltonian,

H(t) = Hmolecule(t) + Hleads + Hmolecule-leads .

The irradiated molecule is modelled by a tight-binding description taking into
account N molecular orbitals |ni, which are relevant for the transport. Disre-

Let us assume that the dynamics of the driven wire is dominated by the time-
dependent wire Hamiltonian so that the coupling to the leads can be taken into
account as a perturbation. This allows to derive by use of standard methods
the approximate equation of motion for the total density operator ̺(t),

the molecule plus the lead Hamiltonian,
U0(t, t′) is the time-evolution operator without the coupling. The ﬁrst term
describes the coherent dynamics of the electrons on the wire, while the second
term represents incoherent hopping of electrons between the leads and the
wire.

The net (incoming minus outgoing) electrical current that ﬂows from lead ℓ

This expression still contains the yet unknown expectation values of solely

ticular on the Heisenberg operators ˜c†
ℓ(t − τ, t) and thus implicitly on the
dynamics of the driven wire. Let us therefore focus on the single-particle
dynamics of the periodically time-dependent wire Hamiltonian Hnn′(t). An
established procedure for the solution of the corresponding Schr¨odinger equa-
tion is to employ a Floquet ansatz amounting to a non-perturbative treatment
of the external driving. There one uses the fact that a complete set of solu-
tions is of the form |Ψα(t)i = exp(−iǫαt/¯h)|Φα(t)i. The so-called quasiener-

4

gies ǫα take over the role of the energy eigenvalues in static systems and
govern the long-time dynamics. The Floquet modes |Φα(t)i obey the time-
periodicity of the driving ﬁeld which allows to express them as a Fourier

which will be solved numerically. We have found that even in the case of strong
driving where the Floquet states comprise many sidebands, a few Fourier
coeﬃcients Rαβ,k are in fact suﬃcient to obtain numerical convergence. This
justiﬁes a posteriori the use of the Floquet states as a basis set.

To conclude the technical part of this work, we note that our approach goes

5

beyond a linear response treatment of the driving and additionally does not
use a so-called rotating wave approximation (RWA) [19,20], which neglects
the oscillatory contributions to Rαβ(t) by the ansatz Rαβ,k = Pα δα,β δk,0. In
fact, we found that a RWA solution delivers inaccurate results in the vicinity
of quasienergy degeneracies.

4 Optical current gate

As a ﬁrst setup that may be suitable as a current control device, we investigate
the transport through a two-level system, i.e. a wire that consists of N = 2
sites — one of them is coupled to the left lead and the other to the right lead.
Then the time-dependent wire Hamiltonian reads in the basis of the molecular
orbitals

where ∆ denotes the tunnel matrix element between the two sites and EL
and ER are the corresponding on-site energies. The laser ﬁeld contributes to
the Hamiltonian (11) a time-dependent bias with amplitude A = −eEd, i.e.
charge times electrical ﬁeld strength times the site-to-site distance. Note that
the electrical ﬁeld may be drastically enhanced due to the presence of the
metallic tips [21]. The eﬀective coupling to each lead is assumed to be equal,
Γℓ = Γ, and an external voltage V is taken into account by a diﬀerence in the
electro-chemical potentials, µL − µR = −eV .

We use in all numerical calculations the tunnel matrix element ∆ as the energy
unit and assume that the eﬀective couplings to the leads are by one order of
magnitude smaller, ¯hΓ = 0.1∆. This corresponds to a large contact resistance
and ensures the applicability of a perturbational approach. A realistic value
is ∆ = 0.1eV, resulting in a current unit eΓ = 0.256 µA. For a site-to-site
distance of 10˚A and a laser frequency Ω = 10∆/¯h, the driving amplitudes
considered below correspond to an electrical ﬁeld amplitude of 106 V/cm at
1 µm wavelength.

The time-averaged current ¯I = ¯IL = − ¯IR through the molecule in a case
where both on-site energies are equal is depicted in Fig. 2. As a striking fea-
ture, we ﬁnd that at certain values of the driving amplitude, the current col-
lapses to less than 1% of its maximal value reached in the absence of the
driving. Closer inspection (not shown) reveals that the width of this depres-
sion is proportional to the molecule-lead coupling Γ. Comparison with the
quasienergy spectrum in the lower panel demonstrates that the current break
downs occur at quasienergy crossings. This relates the present phenomenon to

the CDT, i.e. the standstill of the tunnel dynamics in a driven bistable poten-
tial at quasienergy crossings [11]. For the isolated two-level system (11) with
∆ ≪ Ω, A, the CDT condition reads J0(2A/¯hΩ) = 0 [12], i.e. the suppression
of the tunnelling dynamics is related to the zeros of the Bessel function J0.
As our analysis reveals, the same condition results in a suppression of the
transport through the open system.

An external voltage may be of peculiar inﬂuence to the on-site energies of a
molecular wire [22] and cause an eﬀective bias EL 6= ER in originally symmetric
molecules. Thus, a crucial question is whether the above current suppression
is stable against such a modiﬁcation. The broken lines in Fig. 2 demonstrate
that this is indeed the case. Although the quasienergies now form an avoided
crossing, the current breakdowns do survive; they are even more pronounced,
but slightly shifted towards larger driving amplitudes. This robustness of CDT
based current control combined with the huge on/oﬀ ratio suggests the pre-
sented setup as a promising alternative to structural chemistry-based switch-
ing devices [23,24].

The driving ﬁeld is speciﬁed by the strength A = 25∆ and the angular frequency
Ω = 10∆/¯h; the eﬀective coupling is ¯hΓ = 0.1∆ and the temperature kBT = 0.25∆.
The maximal value of the current ratio IC1/IC2 ≈ 100 is assumed at φ = 60◦.

5 Optical current router

An experimentally more ambitious conﬁguration consists in a planar molecule
with N = 4 sites, three of which are coupled to a central site and are directly
connected to leads (cf. inset of Fig. 3). We borrow from electrical engineering
the designation E, C1, and C2. Here, an external voltage is always applied such
that C1 and C2 have equal electro-chemical potential, i.e. µC1 = µC2 6= µE. In
a perfectly symmetric molecule, where all on-site energies equal each other,
reﬂection symmetry at the horizontal axis ensures that any current which
enters at E, is equally distributed among C1,2, thus IC1 = IC2 = −IE/2. Since
this structure in Fig. 3 is essentially two-dimensional, we have to take also
the polarisation of the laser ﬁeld into account. We assume it to be linear
with an polarisation angle φ as sketched in the inset of Fig. 3. The eﬀective
driving amplitudes of the orbitals which are attached to the leads acquire now
a geometric factor which is only the same for both orbitals C1 and C2 when
φ = 0. For any other polarisation angle, the mentioned symmetry is broken
and the outgoing currents may be diﬀerent from each other. The diﬀerence
may be huge, as depicted in Fig. 3. Their ratio varies from unity for φ = 0 up
to the order of 100 for φ = 60◦. Thus, adapting the polarisation angle enables
one to route the current towards the one or the other drain.

Alternatively, one can keep the polarisation angle at φ = 0 and break the
reﬂection symmetry by using an intrinsically asymmetric molecule, as sketched
in the inset of Fig. 4. This allows to control sensitively the ratio of the outgoing
currents by the strength A of the external ﬁeld, cf. Fig. 4. The switching range
comprises up to four orders of magnitude with an exponential sensitivity.

6 Concluding remarks

We have presented a method for the eﬃcient numerical computation of cur-
rents through periodically time-dependent networks with two or more contacts
to external leads. The application to two types of setups substantiated that
external ﬁelds bear a wealth of possibilities for the manipulation of electrical
currents: in a molecular wire the current can be suppressed by proper time-
dependent ﬁelds. In a three terminal device, it is possible to route by tailored
optical ﬁelds the current that enters from a source towards the one or the
other drain.

The authors hope that their proposals will motivate experimentalists to accept
the challenge of implementing the proposed molecular wire schemes in the lab-
oratory. The two-terminal current gate can possibly be realized using break
junctions exposed to a laser ﬁeld. Alternatively, one could use a self-assembled,
laser-irradiated maze-like layer of sparsely distributed conducting molecules on
a conducting surface. Then by positioning a scanning tunnelling microscope
tip directly over one such molecule, it should be possible to measure the fea-
tures of the predicted gating behaviour. Experimentally more ambitious is the
realization of the arrangement in Fig. 3 with a planar molecule contacted to
three electrodes. Here again, laser-irradiated self-assemblies of molecules such
as carbon nanotube complexes or of biomolecules like metalised DNA [25], or
the use of cationic lipid-DNA complexes [26] as DNA-nanocables, with the
centre-molecule covalently bound to such planar structures, might make the
experiment feasible.

A completely diﬀerent realization of our ﬁndings should be possible in semi-

9

conductor heterostructures. There, instead of a molecule, coherently coupled
quantum dots [27] form the central system. Furthermore, owing to the lower
level spacings, the suitable frequency of the coherent radiation source is then
in the microwave spectral range.

We appreciate helpful discussions with Igor Goychuk and Gert-Ludwig In-
gold. This work has been supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft
through SFB 486 and by the Volkswagenstiftung under grant No. I/77 217.

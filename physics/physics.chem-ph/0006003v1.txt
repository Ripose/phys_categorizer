Abstract

The luminecsence of ZnSCdS − Cu phosphors of various CdS
consentration (0 − 40%) is under investigation. The luminescence was
exited by hydrogen atoms during adsorbtion of thermal energy during
adsorbtion and impact recombination-heterogeneous chemiluminenscence(HCL)
are discussed. The monotone lowering of the conductivity zone bot-
tom level with respect to the valence zone ceiling (from 3, 7eV to
3, 2eV ) with increasing CdS concentration (from 0 − 40%). HCL in-
tensity with respect to CdS (from 3,7 eV to 3,2 eV)- concentration
(Eg)grows rapidly. The dependence of HCL intensity on the forbid-
den zone width can be explained by the action of electron - hole pairs
multiquontum generation mechanism.

n1. The termal energy atoms and molecules trapped on surface are capa-
ble to perform high-frecuency intermolecular and adsorbtional oscillations.
The adsorbtion potential depth of chemical active particles on the uviol sur-
faces variates from q = 1eV up to 10eV (the frecuencies correspondingly
- from ω0 = 1014s−1 up to 1015s−1. One-three photon energy scattering
into a crystal is a very eﬀective process near the border of continious en-
ergy spectrum. The relaxation rate Γvph = 108 − 1011s−1 [1, 2]. Having
released the energy ¯hω0 >> kT during the time-period (2 ÷ 5)Γ−1
vph, a par-
ticle is caught by the surface, but at the same time it has a large energy
exess in its adsorbtion binding (q − ¯hω0 ≥ ¯hω0). The following energy re-
lease into the crystalline lattice is inhibited by the multiquantum processes
((EV − Evi)/(¯hωph) ≥ 3 ÷ 5; Γvph = 102 ÷ 107s−1; ¯hωph-phonon energy). In
this case, the nonphonon relaxation processes of energy release into an ad-
sorbtion layer, to ionized surface states, or to the electrons of impurity, Bloch
and Tamm states are eﬀective [3, 4].

The role of the crystal electron states in the energy accomodation process
taking place in the gas-surface interaction is widely observed during lumines-
cence of solids located into the active gas medium (free atoms, radicals).This
kind of nonequilibrium luminescence is known to be called heterogeneous
chemiluminescence HCl [5]. Two modiﬁcations of HCL are known: radicalo-
recombination and adsorbtion luminescence ( RRL and AL) [5] − [7]. RRL
is observed in the free atoms recombination process, AL - in the process of
adsorption.

n2. This paper presents the experimental results of RRL of ZnSCdS −Cu
with the various cosentrations of CdS(0 − 40%), in the atomic hydrodgen
medium. The atomic hydrodgen is produced by dissociation of the molec-
ular hydrodgen during high-frecuency nonelectrode electric charge.
In its
turn, the molecular hydrodgen is produced by diﬀusion through a heated
palladium.

Kinetic, temperature and spectral characteristic of luminencence are stud-
ied with the help of photoelectric ampliﬁer (P EA − 84) attached to the out-
put of a high-aperture monochromator, sometimes the interference ﬁlters are
used.

In Fig.1, position of spectrum maxima of photo and heterogenerous chemi-
luminescence and the widths of forbidden zone Eg = Eg(ZnS)[1 −C(CdS)]+
Eg(CdS)C(CdS) of phosphor ZnSCdS − Cu are given as functions of con-
centration of CdS(C(CdS) = 0 − 40%).
If can be noted that the rate of
spectrum maxima and Eg(C) displayments are practically thesame. HCL

intensity with respect to CdS - consentration(Eg decreases) grows rapidly
(Fig.2).

For the ZnSCdS − Cu phosphor containing the variable quantities of
CdS(0 − 40%) it is established the Cu2+-centre radiation spectrum is dis-
placed to long wavelength (from 2, 4eV to 1, 9eV ). It is caused by monotone
lowering of the conductity zone bottom level with respect to the valence zone
ceiling (from 3, 7eV to 3, 2eV ), pozition of the Cu2+ - centre with respect to
the valence zone ceiling being the same (theory of indirect activation [5]).

The dependence of the RRL intensity of the ZnSCdS − Cu phospor on
the CdS concentration can be explained by the action of electron-hole pairs
multiquontum generation mechanism.

n3. Because of the oscillation unharmonism and dependence of the dipole
(quadrupole) momentum from binding on the internuclear coordinates, the
interaction between the oscillotory excited dipole and the crystall elerctron
states leads to transmiision of several oscillatory quanta to electrons states
at the same time.

If the Morze potential is chosen to describe the unharmonic oscillator,
then the rate of the multiquantum oscillatory electron transitions by the
zone-zone excitations can be expressed [4] as follows

Γev =

4m2θ2f (mr¯hω0)1/2

Here: me - mass of electron, e - elementary electrical charge, ω0 = α(2q/m)1/2
- oscillator’s cyclic frequency, µ - dipole moment of binding, f - oscillatory
force, ǫ - permittivity, corresponding to the transmission frequency, q - ad-
sorbtion potential depth, Eg - width of forbidden zone, mr - equivalent ef-
fective mass of an electron - hole pair, a -minimal distance of the energy
transportation.

ψ(x) = x2(1 − x−1/2)(1 + (2x)−1/2)

p = z ln z/(z − 1), z = (4q + ¯hω0)/(Eg + ¯hω0).

(1) describes the oscillatory electron transition (inside the static region of a
dipole) produced by the dipole interaction of a valence zone electron with
the electromagnetic ﬁeld of an unharmonic oscillator. To describe the dipole
- quadrupole interaction, it is necessary to change the expression inside the
rectangle parenthesises by [eD(r0)/5a5/2]2.

The (1) and (3) describing the exitation rate can be used to evaluate the
dependence of the phosphor ZnSCdS−Cu luminiscence intensity on the CdS
concentration (the width of the phosphor‘s forbidden zone), (Fig.2). Intensity

of RRLH depends on the exitation cross - section [9] and is proportional to
the rate of the nonequilibrium electron state generation:

Here: σ1-adsorbtion cross-section, σ2 - recombination cross - section, N, N1 -
correspondingly concentration of AL and RP L exitation centres, BAL, BRRL
- quantum yield of luminescence outputs of AL and RRL exitation centres,
(1 + τ ω)−1 - concentration extinguish factor, Γv + Γev - total relaxation rate,
 - atom ﬂux density.

These quantities does not (or in a rather small degree) depend on the

energy width Eg.

For this situations according (1 − 4) we get:

Ic = a/EgΨ(q/Eg)exp(

−Eg
¯hω0

P )

Eg = [3, 6 − 1, 1C(CdS)]eV

where C(CdS) concentration CdS inside the ZnSCdS − Cu phosphor.

The theoretical curve I(C) coincides (in the limits of experimental errors)
with the experimental results (see F ig.2).(¯hω0 = 0, 32eV, q = 4eV ). The
increment of I(C) is not exponential and depends strongly on the factor
(1/Eg)Ψ(q/Eg).

When the CdS concentration is great (C > 60%), the HCL output and
intensity tend to be lower. It is caused by increasing of the consentration
extinguish (factor (1 + τ ω)−1) and rate of the low - energy relaxation Γv of
the oscillatory exitation binding (H − Me2+)v − SU, (H − H)v − SU.

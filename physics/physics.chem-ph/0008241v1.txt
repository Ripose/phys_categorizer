Abstract

This paper presents an analysis of a model problem, consisting of two inter-

acting rigid rings, for the rotation of molecules in liquid 4He. Due to Bose

symmetry, the excitation of the rotor corresponding to a ring of N helium

atoms is restricted to states with integer multiples of N quanta of angular

momentum. This minimal model shares many of the same features of the

rotational spectra that have been observed for molecules in nanodroplets of

≈ 103 − 104 helium atoms. In particular, this model predicts, for the ﬁrst

time, the very large enhancement of the centrifugal distortion constants that

have been observed experimentally. It also illustrates the diﬀerent eﬀects of

increasing rotational velocity by increases in angular momentum quantum

number or by increasing the rotational constant of the molecular rotor.

It

is found that ﬁxed node, diﬀusion Monte Carlo and a hydrodynamic model

provide upper and lower bounds on the size of the eﬀective rotational constant

of the molecular rotor when coupled to the helium.

The spectroscopy of atoms and molecules dissolved in helium nanodroplets is a topic of

intense current interest [1–3]. One particular, almost unique feature of this spectroscopic

host is that even heavy and very anisotropic molecules and complexes give spectra with

rotationally resolved structure [4]. This spectral structure typically corresponds to thermal

equilibrium, with T ≈ 0.38 K, and has the same symmetry as that of the same species in the

gas phase [5,6]. The rotational constants, however, are generally reduced by a factor of up

to four or ﬁve, while the centrifugal distortion constants are four orders of magnitude larger

than for the gas phase [7,6]. These large changes clearly reﬂect dynamical coupling between

the molecular rotation and helium motion. At present, there are at least four diﬀerent models

proposed for the increased eﬀective moments of inertia, at least two of which have reported

quantitative agreement with experiment [8–11]. The large observed distortion constants have

not yet been quantitatively explained, and the most careful attempt to date to calculate them

(for OCS in helium) gave an estimate ≈ 30 times smaller than the experimental value [7]

The highly quantum many body dynamics of this condensed phase system has made it

diﬃcult to achieve a qualitative understanding of the observed eﬀects. In cases like these,

simple models can provide insight, especially if the lessons learned can be tested against

more computationally demanding simulations that seek, however, to provide a ﬁrst principles

treatment of the properties of the system of interest. In this paper, one very simple model

system will be explored that seeks to model the coupling of a molecular rotor to a ﬁrst

solvation shell of helium. The existing models for the reduced rotational constants agree

that most of the observed eﬀect comes from motion of helium in the ﬁrst solvation shell.

Some of the qualitative features of this model were discussed previously [7], but quanitative

details were not persued in that work.

The ‘toy’ model considered consists of a planar rotor coupled to a symmetric planar

ring of N helium atoms. This model problem can be solved exactly, and can reproduce the

size of the observed reductions in the rotational constant AND the size of the centrifugal

distortion constants. This is the ﬁrst time, to the authors knowledge, that the large eﬀective

distortion constants of molecules in liquid helium has been reproduced. Further, this model

2

clearly resolves a confusion about the sign of the centrifugal distortion constant. Based

upon the expected decreased following of the helium with increasing rotational angular

velocity [12,13], one can argue that the rotational spacing should increase faster than for a

rigid rotor,i.e., that the eﬀective centrifugal distortion constant should be negative, in conﬂict

with experimental observations. The present model demonstrates, however, that opposite

behavior is expected when the rotational velocity of the rotor is increased by increasing the

rotational quantum number (where an increased angular anisotropy and following of the

helium is predicted) or when the rotational constant of the isolated rotor is increased (where

decreased angular anisotropy and following of the helium is predicted). The present model,

therefore, rationalizes both the observed depenence of the increased moments of inertia

on the rotational constant of the isolated molecule and the observed centrifugal distortion

constants.

I. THE TOY MODEL

We will consider a highly abstracted model for rotation of a molecule in liquid helium.

The molecule will be treated as a rigid, planar rotor with moment of inertia I1. The ori-

entation of the molecule is given by θ1 The liquid helium is treated as a ring of N helium

atoms that forms another rigid, planar rotor with moment of inertia I2 and with orientation

given by θ2. Because of the Bose symmetry of the helium, he helium rotor can only be

excited to states with N¯h units of angular momentum. The lowest order symmetry allowed

coupling between the molecule and the helium ring is given by a potential V cos [N(θ1 − θ2)].

Any coupling spectral components that are not multiples of N will lead to mixing of states

that are not allowed by Bose symmetry, which is forbidden in quantum mechanics. The

Hamiltonian is given by:

H = −

the above H by introducing the two new coordinates:

¯θ =

We deﬁne Brigid = ¯h2

product:

I1

ψ(¯θ, θ) = eiJ ¯θψv(θ)

(4)

J is the quantum number for total angular momentum. It would appear from the separable

H that the energy could be written as an uncoupled sum of a rigid rotor energy, BrigidJ 2 (

not J(J + 1) because we have a planar rotor), and a ‘vibrational’ energy that is independent

of J. However, the energies are not simply additive, due to the fact that the boundary

condition for θ is J-dependent. When θ2 alone is changed by any multiple of 2π/N, ψ must

be unchanged. However, a change of −2π/N in θ2 results in a change of −(2π/N)(I2/(I1+I2)

in ¯θ and +2π/N in θ. Thus, the Bose symmetry of the helium ring is satisﬁed by taking as

the boundary condition for ψv:

ψv(cid:18)θ +

2π

N (cid:19) = exp(cid:18)2πi

N

I2

I1 + I2

J(cid:19) ψv(θ)

(5)

As a result, the ‘vibrational energies’ and eigenfunctions are a function of the total angular

momentum quantum number, J. Note that the boundary condition is periodic in J, with

period given by N(I1 + I2)/I2.

The J dependence of the boundary condition of the vibrational function is rather unfa-

miliar in molecular physics. This dependence can be removed by a Unitary transformation

of the wavefunction:

ψ′

v(θ) = exp(cid:18)−i

I2J

θ(cid:19) ψv(θ)

(6)

The boundary condition on the transformed function is ψ′

transformed hamiltonian, H ′, is given by:

rmv(cid:16)θ + 2π

N(cid:17) = ψ′

rmv (θ). The

H ′ =

(J − L)2 +

2I2

L2 + V cos (Nθ)

(7)

where J = i¯h ∂

∂ ¯θ is the operator for total angular momentum, and L = i¯h ∂

∂θ is the angular

momentum of the helium ring relative to a frame moving with the rotor. This form of

the Hamiltonian closely resembles those widely used in treatment of weakly bound com-

plexes [14]. Expansion of the (J − L)2 gives a Coriolis term that couples the overall rotation

to the vibrational motion, which makes the nonseperability of these motions evident. This

form, however, hides the periodicity in J of this the coupling.

We will now consider the two limiting cases. The ﬁrst to consider is that where |V | ≫

N 2Brel.

In this case, the potential can be considered harmonic around θ = 2πk/N, k =

0 . . . N − 1 when V is negative (and shifted by π/N for V positive) with harmonic frequency

ν = 1

2πr2N 2|V |(cid:16) 1

I1

+ 1

I2(cid:17). The wavefunction will decay to nearly zero at the maxima of

the potential, and changes in the phase of the periodic boundary condition at this point

(which happens with changes in J) will not signiﬁcantly aﬀect the energy. In this limit, the

total energy is E(J, v) = BrigidJ 2 + hν(v + 1/2), and we have a rigid rotor spectrum with

eﬀective moment of inertia I1 + I2. While there are N equivalent minima, Bose symmetry

assures that only one linear combination of the states localized in each well (the totally

symmetric combination for J = 0) is allowed, and thus there are no small tunneling splittings,

even in the high barrier limit. The total angular momentum is partitioned between the

two rotors in proportion to their moments of inertia, i.e. < J1 >= ¯hJ · I1/(I1 + I2) and

< J2 >= ¯hJ · I2/(I1 + I2).

We will now consider the opposite, or uncoupled rotor, limit. The eigenenergies in this

case are trivially E(m1, m2) = B1m2

1 + B2m2

2 with eigenfunctions ψ = exp (im1θ1 + im2θ2).

m1 can be any integer, while m2 = Nk, where k is any integer. Introducing the total angular

momentum quantum number J = m1 + m2, we have E(J, m2) = B1(J − m2)2 + B2 m2

2. The

lowest state for each J has quantum numbers m1 = J − Nk and m2 = Nk, where k is the

5

nearest integer to B1J/N(B1 + B2). Treating the quantum numbers as continuous, we have

E = BrigidJ 2, e.g., the same as for rigid rotation of the rotors. However when we restrict J

to integer values, for J ≤ N(B1 + B2)/(2B1), the energy spacing will be exactly that of a

rigid rotor with rotational constant B1. In general, as a function of J, the uncoupled ground

state solutions follow the rigid rotor spectrum in B1, but with a series of equally spaced

curve crossings when the lowest energy m2 value increases by N as J is increased by one

quantum. These crossings allow the total energy to oscillate around that predicted for a

rigid rotor with moment of inertia I1 + I2.

II. NUMERICAL RESULTS

Having handled the limiting cases, we can now turn our attention to the far more in-

teresting question, which is how does the energy and eigenstate properties change as V is

continuously varied between these limits. We note that changing the sign of V is equivalent

to translation of the solution by ∆θ = π, and thus we will only consider positive values

of V explicitly. We also note that the eigenstates are not changed, and the eigenenergies

scale linearly if B1, B2, and V are multiplied by a constant factor. As a result, we will

take B2 = 1 to normalize the energy scale. The solutions for ﬁnite values of V were cal-

culated using the uncoupled basis and the form of H given in Eq. 1 with ﬁxed values of

m1 + m2 = J and m2 = Nk. For each value of J, the matrix representation for H is a

tridiagonal matrix, with diagonal elements given by the energies for the uncoupled limit,

and with oﬀ-diagonal elements given by V /2. Numerical calculations were done using a ﬁnite

basis with k = −15, −14, . . . 15.

Using B1 = B2 and N = 8, we have calculated the lowest eigenvalues of H for J = 0, 1, 2

and used these, by ﬁtting to the expression E(v, J) = E0(v) + BeﬀJ 2 − DeﬀJ 4, to determine

Beﬀ and Deﬀ. Figure 1 shows the value of Beﬀ as a function of V (both in units of B2). It

can be seen that Beﬀ varies smoothly from B1 to Brigid with increasing V , and is reaches a

value half way between these limits for V ≈ N 2B2.

6

In order to rationalize this observation, we will now consider a Quantum Hydrodynamic

treatment for the rotation [15]. Let the ground state density be ρ(θ) = |ψv(θ)|2. Now let the

molecule classically rotate with angular velocity ω. To ﬁrst order in ω, ρ will not change (i.e.

we will have adiabatic following of the helium density for classical inﬁnitesimal rotation of

the molecule). However, the vibrational wavefunction, ψv will no longer be real, but instead

will have an angle-dependent phase factor whose gradient will give a hydrodynamic velocity.

Solving the equation of continuity:

d
dθ

(ρv) = −

dρ
dt

= ωr

dρ
dθ

where r is the radius of the helium ring, gives solutions of the form:

v(θ) = ωr · 1 −

C

ρ(θ)!

(8)

(9)

where C is an integration constant. We determine C by minimizing the kinetic energy

averaged over θ. This gives:

and a kinetic energy:

C =

R 2π

∆Ek =

1
2

I2ω2 · 1 −

4π2

0 ρ−1dθ!
R 2π

(10)

(11)

In the case of a uniform density, ρ = (2π)−1 and ∆Ek = 0. As the density gets more

anisotropic, the integral becomes larger and ∆Ek becomes larger, approaching the value

for rigid rotation of the helium ring when ρ has a node in its angular range. We deﬁne

the hydrodynamic contribution to the increase in the moment of inertia of the heavy rotor

due to partial rotation of the light rotor by ∆Ek = 1

2 ∆Ihω2. It is interesting to note that

for the above lowest energy value of C, we have R 2π

0 v(θ)dθ = 0. (i.e. that the solution is

‘irrotational’) and that the net angular momentum induced in the helium is ∆Ihω. The

lowest energy solution of the three dimensional Quantum hydrodynamic model satiﬁes these

conditions as well [10,16].

7

The hydrodynamic model can be tested against the exact quantum solutions. Deﬁne

∆Ieﬀ as the eﬀective moment of inertia for rotation (as calculated from Beﬀ) minus the

moment of inertia for the molecular rotor. ∆Ieﬀ will grow from 0 for uncoupled rotors

to I2 as the coupling approachs the rigid coupling limit of high V . In the hydrodynamic

model, ∆Ieﬀ = ∆Ih. Figure 2 shows a plot that compares ∆Ieﬀ and ∆Ih as a function of V .

Each has been normalized by I2. They are found to be in qualitative agreement for the full

range of V , though the exact quantum solution is systematically below the hydrodynamic

prediction. We note, however, that for the assumed parameters, the speed of the molecular

rotor is equal to that of the helium rotor, while the hydrodynamic treatment assumed a

classical, inﬁnitesimal rotation of the molecular rotor.

The size of ∆Ieﬀ is determined by the degree of anisotropy of the ground state density in

the vibrational displacement coordinate θ. If I1 is decreased at ﬁxed I2 and V , the eﬀective

mass for θ, which is (I −1

1 + I −1

2 )−1 will also decrease, which will decrease the anisotropy

produced by V . Fig 3 shows how the normalized ∆Ieﬀ and ∆Ih vary as the molecular

rotational constant, B1, changes from 0 to 2B2. This calculation was done for V = 100,

close to the value corresponding to maximum diﬀerence of ∆Ieﬀ and ∆Ih for B1 = B2.

This plot demonstrates that the hydrodynamic prediction becomes exact in the limit that

B1 → 0, i.e., in the case that the assumption of inﬁnitesimal rotational velocity of the

molecule holds. However, it substantially overestimates the increase eﬀective moment of

inertia when B1 ≥ B2. This decrease in the increase moment of inertia with increasing

rotational constant of the heavy rotor is the eﬀect previously interpreted as the breakdown

of adiabatic following in the literature on the rotational spectrum of molecules in liquid

Helium [12,10,13].

Figure 4 shows a plot of Deﬀ as a function of V for B1 = B2 = 1. Deﬀ = 0 is zero in both

limits, and has a maximum value near the value of V at which Beﬀ is changing most rapidly.

It is interesting to explicitly point out that this Deﬀ value arises entirely from changes in the

angular anisotropy of the helium density with J, as the model does not allow for an increase

in the radial distance of the helium, which has previously been considered [7]. Further, the

8

peak value of Deﬀ ≈ 1.8 · 10−3B1 is in remarkably good agreement with the ratio of Deﬀ

to the gas phase molecular rotational constant observed for a number of molecules in liquid

helium. For example, for OCS this ratio is found to be 2 · 10−3 [7], while for HCCCN, the

same ratio was found to be 1 · 10−3 [17].

We can gain further insight by examining the rotational energy systematically as a func-

tion of J. Figure 5 shows the rotational excitation energy (E(0, J) − E(0, 0)) divided by

J 2 as a function of J. The calculations were done with V = 100. The rotational excitation

energy approaches that of the BrigidJ 2 for high J. Further, it reaches this value for J equal

to multiples of N(I1 + I2)/I2, which matches the periodicity of the boundary conditions for

ψv. J values that lead to the same boundary conditions for ψv will diﬀer in energy only by

the eigenvalues of Hr, and thus it follows from Eq. 2, that of a rigid rotor with rotational

constant Brigid. For the ﬁrst half of each period in J, ψv is found to increase in its anisotropy,

and therefore the energy increases, as J is increased (See Fig. 6). This can be understood

when one considers the fact that for J = N(I1 + I2)/(2I2), the boundary condition is that

ψv(2π/N) = −ψv(0), i.e. the wavefunction will be real but have N nodes in the interval

[0, 2π].

Classically, the molecular rotor is characterized by its rotational angular velocity, ω =

2B1J. However, we see that the quantum treatment of the two coupled rotors gives opposite

results when ω is increased by increasing either B1 or J. For increases in B1, the ‘degree

of following’ of the light rotor decreases for ﬁxed potential coupling, as seems intuitively

reasonable. However, for increases in J, the anisotropy of the potential and thus the ‘degree

of following’ initially increases, and thus so does the eﬀective moment of inertia of the coupled

system. This behavior continues until one passes through a resonance condition where the

helium can be excited by transfer of N quantum of angular momentum from molecular

rotor to the helium. This resonance condition is missing from the classical treatment of the

coupling between the rotors, where the angular velocity of the molecular rotor is treated as

a ﬁxed quantity, ω, which is one of the parameters of the problem.

9

III. NODAL PROPERTIES OF SOLUTIONS

It is possible to calculate the rotational excitation energies of clusters of helium around

a molecule by use of the Fixed Frame Diﬀusion Monte Carlo (FFDMC) method [12]. As

in most DMC methods, this method should yield (except for statistical ﬂuctuations) a

upper bound on the true energy, ﬁnding the optimal wavefunction consistent with the nodal

properties that are imposed on the wavefunction by construction. In the case of FFDMC,

the nodal planes are determined by the free rotor rotational wavefunction for the molecule

alone, i.e. that the sign of the wavefunction (which is taken to be real) for any point in

conﬁguration space is the same as that of the rotor wavefunction at the same Euler angles.

We can examine the exact solutions of our toy problem to gain insight into the accuracy

of the nodal planes assumed in FFDMC. The wavefunctions we have considered up to now

are complex, but because of time reversal symmetry, the solutions with J and −J rotational

quantum numbers must be degenerate. Symmetric combination of these solutions just gives

the Real part of J solution, and the antisymmetric combination the Imaginary part. The

real part is given by:

ψR

J (θ1, θ2) = cos(Jθ1)Re(ψ′(θ2 − θ1)) − sin(Jθ2)Im(ψ′(θ2 − θ1))

(12)

where

ψ′(∆θ) = Xk

cJ
k exp(ikN∆θ)

(13)

and cJ

k are the eigenvector coeﬃcients obtained from diagonalization of the real Hamiltonian

matrix in the uncoupled basis. Examination of the numerical solutions reveals that for

J < N, Re(ψ′) has no nodes, while Im(ψ′) has nodes at ∆θ equal to integer multiples of

π/N. Thus, if Im(ψ′) = 0, then the solution would satisfy the FFDMC nodal properties

exactly. However, for ﬁnite Im(ψ′), the nodal surfaces, rather than being on the planes

θ1 = constant, are modulated N times per cycle along the θ1 = constant line. For V = 80

and B1 = B2 = 1, the maximum value of Im(ψ′) is about 4% of Re(ψ′), and growing

approximately linearly for low J.

10

In order to test the quantiative implications of this error in the nodal properties, impor-

tance sampled DMC calculations have been done for the present two rotor problem. The

explicit DMC algorithm given by Reynolds et al. [18] was used with minor change [19]. The

guiding function, ψT, which determines the nodes, was selected as cos(Jθ1)ψ0

v(θ1 −θ2), where

ψ0

v is the real, positive deﬁnite eigenstate for the J = 0 problem. The rotational constant,

BDMC is deﬁned as the DMC estimated energy for J = 1 less the exact ground state eigenen-

ergy for J = 0, and will be (except for sampling and ﬁnite time step bias) an upper bound

on the true B value calculated earlier. The points plotted in ﬁgure 1 are the calculated

values of BDMC with the estimated 2σ error estimates. It is seen that the ﬁxed node DMC

estimates of Beﬀ are excellent for low values of V , but underestimate the contribution of the

Helium ring to the eﬀective moment of inertia as it is coupled more strongly to the rotor.

IV. RELATIONSHIP WITH A MORE REALISTIC MODEL

In a series of insightful lectures, Anthony Leggett analyzed the properties of the ground

state of N Helium atoms conﬁned to an annulus of radius R and spacing d ≪ R [15].

The walls of the annulus are allowed to classically rotate with angular velocity ω. While

not stated explicitly, the walls of the annulus couple to the helium via a time dependent

potential, which is static in the rotating frame. As such, our rotating diatomic molecule

can be considered as a special case of the problem treated by Leggett. If one transforms to

the rotating frame, the quantum hamiltonian is the same as for the static (ω = 0) problem.

However, the boundary condition for the wavefunction in this frame is given by [15][Eq.

(2.10)]:

Ψ′

0(θ1, θ2 . . . θj + 2π . . . θN ) = exp(cid:16)2πimR2ω/¯h(cid:17) Ψ′

0(θ1, θ2 . . . θj . . . θN )

(14)

In making a comparison to the results of the toy model, we note that for this system I2 =

NmR2 (the classical moment of inertia for the helium) and J = ω(I1 + I2)/¯h. Substitution

shows that the phase factor in Eq. 14 is identical to that derived above for Eq. 5. Note,

11

however, that Eq. 14 refers to moving one helium atom by 2π, while Eq. 5 refers to motion

of all N helium atoms by 2π/N. Motion of all N helium atoms by 2π will result in a phase

factor of 2πiNmR2ω/¯h = 2πiI2J/(I1 + I2) in both treatments.

Leggett considered the change in helium energy produced by rotation of the walls. Let

E0 be the ground state energy for the static problem, and E ′

0(ω) the ground state energy

in the rotating frame. The ground state energy in the laboratory frame is given by [15][Eq.

(2.12)]:

Elab = E0 +

1
2

I2ω2 − [E ′

0(ω) − E0]

(15)

For the ground state of Bosons, we further have that E ′

0(ω) ≥ E0, with equality only when

ω equals integer multiples of ω0 = ¯h/mR2 since the nodeless state has the lowest possible

energy. At ω = kω0, the helium rigidly rotates with the walls. This agrees exactly with

the numerical results of the toy model, as shown in Figure 5. In making comparisons with

this model, one should remember that Elab does not include the kinetic energy of the walls

(rotor). Thus the more general treatment of Leggett supports one of the central insights of

the toy model, that the large eﬀective distortion constants for molecular rotors in helium is

a consequence of an increased helium following of the rotor with increasing angular velocity,

which in turn is a direct consequence of the ω dependence of the single-valuedness boundary

condition in the rotating frame.

The moment of inertia for the ground state of the helium can be deﬁned by:

I =   d2Elab

dω2 !ω→0

= I2 −  d2E ′

0(ω)

dω2 !ω→0

(16)

Leggett deﬁned the “normal fraction” of the helium by the ratio I/I2, which is equal to unity

if E ′

0(ω) is independent of ω as ω → 0. This will occur if the wavefunction has ‘nontrivial’

nodal planes, since the phase of the wavefunction can be changed discontinuously at a

node without cost of energy. Nodal plans associated with overlap of particles, however, are

‘trivial’ in that the phase relationship on each side of the node is determined by the exchange

symmetry of the wavefunction, and thus cannot be used to match the boundary conditions

12

without extra cost of energy.

In our toy problem, when V is very large, the vibrational

wavefunction becomes localized, introducing near nodes at the maxima of the potential, and

as a result the ground state is described by a near unity normal fraction; we have what

Leggett refers to as a ‘normal solid’. Conversely, as the uncoupled limit is approached, the

helium ring does not contribute to the kinetic energy of the lowest rotational states and

we have I → 0, and we have zero normal fraction (i.e. the helium has unity superﬂuid

fraction). Following Leggett’s deﬁnition, one ﬁnds that the normal fraction is given by

∆Ieﬀ/I2. Thus, Figure 2 can thus be interpreted as the normal ﬂuid fraction for the ground

state as a function of the strength of the potential coupling. Leggett’s analysis is based upon

a classical treatment of the motion of the walls, which implies I1 ≫ I2, in which limit the

hydrodynamic model exactly predicts the normal ﬂuid fraction.

[19] It was found that when Walkers moved very close to a node, they became trapped, due

to the large size of the attempted steps introduced by the drift term combined with the

‘detailed balance’ correction selection criteria. When they also had large negative values

of the local energy, these trapped walkers then grew in weight, leading to unphysical

large negative values for the DMC estimate for the energy. This problem, which is part of

the ﬁnite time step bias, was eliminated by killing walkers that failed the detail balance

selection instead of keeping them at their previous location.

FIG. 1. Eﬀective Rotational Constant for two coupled rotors as a function of the interaction

potential strength. B1 = B2 = 1, and the second rotor can only be excited to states with multiples

of 8 quanta. The individual points are the B eﬀective values calclated by a ﬁxed node, Diﬀusion

Monte Carlo calculation. The error bars on these points are the estimated 2σ sampling error.

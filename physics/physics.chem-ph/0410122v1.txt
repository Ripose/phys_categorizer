We propose approximations which go beyond the local density approximation for the short-range
exchange and correlation density functionals appearing in a multi-determinantal extension of the
Kohn-Sham scheme. A ﬁrst approximation consists in deﬁning locally the range of the interaction
in the correlation functional. Another approximation, more conventional, is based on a gradient
expansion of the short-range exchange-correlation functional. Finally, we also test a short-range
generalized-gradient approximation by extending the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof exchange-correlation
functional to short-range interactions.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The Kohn-Sham (KS) scheme [1] of density functional
theory (DFT) (see, e.g., [2, 3]) can be extended to han-
dle multi-determinantal wave functions [4]. This enables
to describe near-degeneracy correlation eﬀects by explic-
itly taking into account several Slater determinants. The
method is based on a decomposition of the true Coulomb
electron-electron interaction as

1
r

= vµ

ee(r) + ¯vµ

ee(r),

(1)

(2)

ee(r) is a long-range interaction and ¯vµ
where vµ
ee(r) is the
complement short-range interaction. This separation is
controlled by the parameter µ. In previous studies [5, 6,
7], the error function has been used to deﬁne the long-
range interaction

referred to as the erf interaction. More recently [? ], we
have proposed a sharper long-range/short-range separa-
tion with the erfgau interaction

same physical meaning for the erf and erfgau interac-
tions: 1/µ represents the distance beyond which the in-
teraction reduces to the usual Coulomb long-range tail.

the constant c was absorbed
into the parameter µ). Both modiﬁed interactions de-

Previous applications of the method [6, 7] show that,
for a reasonable long-range/short-range separation (µ not
too small) and if the few most important (nearly degener-
ate) conﬁgurations are included in the wave function Ψµ,
good results are obtained for total atomic and molecu-
lar energies, including near-degenerate systems. This is
remarkable since, in these previous studies, only the sim-
ple local density approximation (LDA) was used for the
short-range functional ¯Eµ
xc[n].

The purpose of the present work is to further improve
the accuracy of the method by proposing approxima-
tions for ¯Eµ
xc[n] which go beyond the LDA. We will not
present in this paper total energies E (or equivalently
total exchange-correlation energies Exc), but will focus
only on short-range exchange-correlation energies ¯Eµ
xc.
Indeed, for a chosen µ, it is the approximation for ¯Eµ
xc[n]
that limits in practice the accuracy of the method, not
the other long-range contributions to the energy that can
be calculated by a traditional ab initio wave function
method. We will test our proposed approximations for
¯Eµ
xc by comparison to accurate data obtained for small
atomic systems.

The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we dis-
cuss the limitations of the LDA for ¯Eµ
xc[n]. In Sec. III,
we introduce a local interaction parameter µ to improve
the LDA correlation functional. We then discuss the ex-
tension of traditional gradient corrections to the short-
range functional ¯Eµ
xc[n]. Indeed, the short-range versions
of the gradient expansion approximation (GEA) is pre-
sented in Sec. IV, while Sec. V contains the extension of a
generalized-gradient approximation (GGA), namely the
PBE functional [9], to a modiﬁed interaction. Finally,
Sec. VI contains our concluding remarks.

Atomic units will be used throughout this work.

II. LIMITATIONS OF THE LDA

In the LDA, the short-range exchange-correlation en-
ergy per particle ¯εµ,unif
(n) of a uniform electron gas with
modiﬁed interaction [5, 10] is transferred locally to the
inhomogeneous system of interest

Z

To underline the dependence on the interaction parame-
ter, we will refer to this approximation as µ-LDA.

In Figs. 1 and 2, we have plotted the short-range LDA
exchange and correlation energies of the Be atom with
respect to µ for the erf and erfgau interactions. An ac-
curate density obtained from a multi-reference conﬁgura-
tion interaction calculation with single and double excita-
tions (MRCISD) [11, 12] has been used. For comparison,
accurate calculations of the exchange and correlations en-
ergies along the adiabatic connections are also reported.
In these accurate calculations, we start from an accurate
reference density and, for each µ, numerically optimize
the external potential vµ(r) appearing in Eq. (6) so as
to recover the reference density. The ground-state wave
function Ψµ is then computed according to Eq. (6) by
MRCISD and the various energy components like the
short-range exchange and correlation energies are de-
duced. (For further details, see Refs. 13, 14, 15).

For both the erf and erfgau interactions, the µ-LDA is
very accurate for large µ but fails near the KS end (µ = 0)
of the adiabatic connection. In particular, the exchange
energy is underestimated and the correlation energy is

0.5 Hartree at µ

overestimated. Thanks to a sharper separation of long-
range and short-range electron-electron interactions, the
erfgau interaction provides a slight improvement over the
erf interaction. In fact, Fig. 1 shows that the erfgau µ-
LDA exchange energy curve reaches the exact one for a
2.5)
larger energy (
≈
than in the erf case (
3), meaning
that the erfgau µ-LDA is able to correctly describe a
larger part of the exchange energy. For the correlation
energy, the two interactions lead to similar results. We
note in passing that the unimportant little bump on the
curve of the accurate correlation energy for small µ with
the erfgau interaction in Fig. 2 (and in other following
ﬁgures) is a manifestation of the non-monotonicity of this
interaction with respect to µ (being in turn responsible
for its attractive character for very small µ [10]). In the
remaining of the paper, we will present results only for
the erfgau interaction.

≈

The performance of the µ-LDA can be further ana-
lyzed by looking, for instance, at the correlation energy
density ¯εµ
c (r). There is not unique deﬁnition of this quan-
tity; we used the deﬁnition of Ref. 16 or 15 based on the

c(r1, r2) is the correlation hole for the interac-
where nξ
tion parameter ξ. In Fig. 3, this correlation energy den-
sity accurately computed for the Be atom is compared
with the µ-LDA with the erfgau interaction for a series
of µ’s. For µ = 0 (KS system), the correlation energy
density of Eq. (9) is largely overestimated by the LDA
over the whole range of r. When µ is increased (Fig. 3
with µ = 0.21 and µ = 1.20), the µ-LDA starts to bet-
ter reproduces the accurate energy density in the valence
region (r & 1) but still overestimates it in the core re-
gion (r . 1). For the µ-LDA to also well reproduce the
core region, larger values of µ are required (Fig. 3 with
µ = 3.00).

Having in mind that the choice of a large value of µ
means an important computational eﬀort for the part of
the energy treated by wave function methods, it is im-
portant to improve the short-range exchange-correlation
functional toward the small µ region of the adiabatic con-
nection.

III. LDA CORRELATION WITH LOCAL
INTERACTION PARAMETER

In inhomogeneous systems the electrons are correlated
on a shorter distance than in the uniform electron gas.
Thus, within the KS scheme, the LDA transfers spurious
long-range correlation contributions from the electron gas
to the ﬁnite system of interest. This point have long been
understood and have guided important developments in
density functional approximations. For instance, Lan-
greth and Mehl [17, 18] proposed a gradient correction to
the LDA based on a cut-oﬀ in momentum-space for small
k which basically corresponds to removing the long-range
interaction eﬀects.

In the method proposed here, for small µ, i.e. when a
large range of the electron-electron interaction is retained
in the functional part, the µ-LDA also transfers spurious
long-range interaction eﬀects from the uniform electron
gas to ﬁnite systems and leads to an overestimation of the
correlation energy. A simple way to eliminate this incor-
rect long-range interaction eﬀects, is to use in the µ-LDA
correlation functional an eﬀective interaction parameter,
larger than the one used in the wave function part of
the calculation. Of course, in the uniform electron gas,
the range of the interaction is relative to the density (the
relevant scaled variable is r/rs with rs = (4πn/3)−1/3)
and consequently one has to actually consider an eﬀec-
tive local interaction parameter, µl(r), deﬁned from the
inhomogeneous density proﬁle n(r). However, the in-
teraction parameter used in the functional must not be
smaller that the global µ used in the wave function part
of the calculation to avoid a double counting of correla-
tion eﬀects. We therefore take in the correlation µ-LDA

3

functional an eﬀective local interaction parameter given
by

µeﬀ(r) = max(µl(r), µ).

(10)

Thus, this approximation corresponds to simply drop oﬀ
some long-range correlation from the LDA in regions of
space where µl(r) > µ.

Several choices are possible for the local interaction
parameter µl(r). The ﬁrst natural length scale in real
space for the electron-electron interaction is provided by
the Wigner-Seitz radius rs, representing the radius of the
sphere centered in r containing one electron. Equiva-
lently, the same length scale can be expressed in momen-
tum space by the Fermi wave vector kF = 1/(αrs) where
α = (9π/4)−1/3. Following a previous work [7], we thus
take as a local interaction parameter

µl,a(r) =

= αkF (r).

(11)

1
rs(r)

However, studies of the uniform electron gas indicate that
the relevant length scale for correlation eﬀects in momen-
tum space is given by the Thomas-Fermi wave vector
ks =
4kF /π describing the screening of the Coulomb
interaction. Similarly to Eq. (11), we can thus take as
local interaction parameter

p

µl,b(r) = αks(r) =

(12)

2

α/π
p
rs(r)

.

p

More elaborated dependences of µl on rs are possible.
For example, Ferrell [19] has determined a momentum
cut-oﬀ in the uniform electron gas corresponding to the
shortest wavelength at which plasma oscillations can be
sustained by the electron gas. It turns out however that
results obtained with a local interaction parameter set
to Ferrel’s momentum cut-oﬀ are very similar to those
obtained with the local interaction parameter of Eq. (12)
and will not be discussed here.

A much more interesting possibility is to choose a lo-
cal interaction parameter depending on the gradient of
the density. In fact, as summarized by Svendsen and von
Barth [20] from the work of Langreth and Mehl [17, 18]
and Perdew et al. [21], “distances over which electrons
are correlated in realistic inhomogeneous systems are de-
termined more by actual variations in the density proﬁle
than by the screening of an electron gas at the local value
of the density”. We use a simple geometrical argument
similar of that of Langreth and Mehl [17] to determine a
local characteristic distance d(r) over which the density
varies in an inhomogeneous system. Consider a density
distribution with constant density gradient consisting of
an isosceles triangle as a prototype of an atom. The ex-
tension of this density distribution is d = 4n/
where
n is the density at the middle of one side of the trian-
gle, i.e. a typical value of the density. We thus deﬁne a
(semi)local interaction parameter by

0.21, 1.20, 3.00. Accurate data computed from integration over the adiabatic connection (Eq. 9, full curve) are compared with
the µ-LDA (dashed curve).

The constant 4 in Eq. (13) is somehow arbitrary; experi-
ence shows that this is reasonable.

Fig. 4 shows the correlation energy is greatly improved
by the local µ approach. However, for the choices µl,a =
αkF or µl,b = αks, a more detailed analysis through
the correlation energy density in Fig. 5 indicates the µ-
LDA functional with a local µ is only an average of the
“exact” correlation energy density. Of course, the µ-LDA
functional with a local µ improves on increasing of µ (not
shown) but it is clear that both choices are inadequate
for describing the shell structure. On the contrary, one
sees on the same Fig. 5 that the choice µl,c =
/(4n)
|
enables to recover well the shell structure in Be. We
therefore consider this last choice as the more appropriate
local parameter µl for improving the LDA correlation
functional.

Finally, we note that this local µ approach cannot be
directly applied to the exchange energy. Indeed, the LDA
underestimates the exchange energy and thus choosing a
large eﬀective interaction parameter in the µ-LDA would
only deteriorate the exchange energy.

IV. GRADIENT EXPANSIONS

We now consider more conventional approaches to cor-
rect the local density approximation at small interaction
parameter, namely gradient corrections.

for larger values of µ, µ-GEA-Lap and µ-GEA become
nearly identical (not shown). Of course, µ-GEA-Lap and
µ-GEA give the same short-range exchange energy ¯Eµ

This is based on the observation that, for µ = 0, the
exchange-correlation contribution to the linear response
of the uniform electron gas to a slowly oscillating pertur-
bation (small momenta) almost vanishes [22]. This short-
range GEA functional approximation will be referred to
as µ-GEA. Our interest is to evaluate the improvement
brought by µ-GEA over µ-LDA for the exchange and cor-
relation energies separately. Notice that, in our construc-
tion, if we consider exchange and correlation together µ-
GEA is identical to µ-LDA.

2) than the µ-LDA curve (µ

The µ-GEA exchange energy is plotted in Fig 7. For
large µ (µ & 3), the range of the interaction is too small
to feel the slowly oscillating gradient correction and the
µ-GEA functional reduces to the µ-LDA functional. The
µ-GEA curve reaches the exact one at a smaller value of
µ (µ
3). For small µ,
the µ-GEA reduces the µ-LDA error by about a factor
two. For the correlation energy (Fig. 8), the µ-GEA also
extends the domain of validity of the µ-LDA when µ is
decreased down to µ
4. For smaller µ when long-range
correlation eﬀects are introduced in the functional, the
gradient expansion breaks down.

Whereas the GEA for the KS scheme (µ = 0) often
disappointingly deteriorates the LDA in real inhomoge-
neous systems [23, 24], it can be consider as a systematic
way to extend the domain of validity of the µ-LDA for
the short-range part only of the exchange and correlation
functionals. These results are in agreement with the wave
vector analysis of the GEA by Langreth and Perdew [25]
who found that the GEA works well for large momenta
(corresponding to short-range density ﬂuctuations).

V. SHORT-RANGE PBE FUNCTIONAL

Starting from the gradient expansions of the previous
section, it is possible to construct generalized-gradient
approximations (GGA) for the short-range exchange and
correlation energy functionals which cure the main short-
comings of the µ-GEA. We have actually constructed a
modiﬁed version of the PBE functional [9] for the mod-
iﬁed interactions. All of the details of the construction
of this functional that we will call µ-PBE are given in
Appendix B. We simply mention here that we have use
the same ansatz than PBE and impose similar theoreti-
cal constraints. However, a diﬀerence with the PBE ap-
proach is that we impose the second-order gradient coef-
ﬁcient for exchange and approximate that of correlation
from it while PBE did the opposite. Consequently, our
µ-PBE functional does not reduce to the original PBE
for µ = 0.

adiabatic connection are compared to the µ-LDA and µ-
GEA functionals in Figs. 7 and 8. For a simple system
like the Be atom, the µ-GEA and µ-PBE functionals are
nearly identical for the exchange energy. For the corre-
lation part, one sees that µ-PBE greatly improved the
µ-LDA and µ-GEA results. The µ-PBE correlation en-
ergy is indeed very accurate along the entire adiabatic
connection, except near the KS end (µ = 0) where a
signiﬁcant error remains. This inaccuracy of (semi)local
functionals at µ = 0 is in favor of the strategy consisting
in escaping the KS scheme by using a short-range func-
tional at ﬁnite µ and treating the remaining part of the
energy by other, more appropriate methods. In Fig. 9,
it is shown that the correlation energy density of µ-PBE
functional qualitatively describes the shell structure of
the Be atom for small µ.

Finally, the diﬃcult case of the Ne6+ atom, presenting
strong near-degeneracy correlation eﬀects, is reported in
Fig. 10. The correlation energy given by the µ-PBE func-
LDA. Again,
tional actually over-corrects that of the µ
this result suggests that for small µ semilocal approxi-
mations like the µ-PBE functional are inappropriate, es-
pecially when near-degeneracy correlation eﬀects play an
important role.

VI. CONCLUDING REMARKS

In this paper, we have considered exchange and cor-
relation energy functionals associated to short-range
electron-electron interactions. We have proposed new
approximations which partially correct the local density
approximation. Indeed, we showed that the short-range
LDA correlation energy can be signiﬁcantly corrected by
simply adjusting in the functional the range of the in-
teraction locally from the density and its gradient. We

abatic connection for the Ne6+ atom. Accurate data (full

curve) and the µ-PBE functional (short-dashed curve).

have also constructed generalizations of the GEA and
of a GGA (namely, the PBE functional) to the case of
short-range interactions. These new short-range func-
tionals treat well a larger range of electron-electron inter-
action than the short-range LDA. However, better (possi-
bly non-local) approximations are still needed to further
extend the range of interaction well treated by the func-
tional.

the z-integrand of the µ-GEA exchange energy density
(Eq. A16) has been plotted with respect to z in Fig. 11
in the case of the erf
interaction. One sees that the
spurious strong oscillations of the GEA exchange hole
at large interelectronic distances are eﬃciently cut oﬀ at
ﬁnite µ by the short-range interaction. In other words,
only the short-range part of the GEA exchange hole is
used in the short-range exchange functional.

In order to appreciate the contribution of the gradient
term of the µ-GEA with respect to the interaction pa-
rameter, we have represented ¯εunif
(n) in
Fig. 12 for the erf and erfgau interactions. Not surpris-
ingly, the gradient correction is decreased for a short-
range interaction. Notice however that for small ˜µ, the
gradient correction for the erfgau is increased compared
to the Coulomb case ˜µ = 0.

APPENDIX B: SHORT-RANGE PBE
FUNCTIONAL

In the context of Kohn-Sham DFT, Perdew, Burke and
Ernzerhof [9] have proposed a gradient-corrected func-
tional where the parameters are determined so as to sat-
isfy theoretical conditions. We propose here to gener-
alize the PBE functional along the erf or erfgau adia-
batic connection. We note that for a diﬀerent purpose
Heyd, Scuseria and Ernzerhof [32] has already derived a
short-range version of the exchange PBE functional cor-
responding to the erf
interaction by using a model of
the PBE exchange hole [33]. (The obtained functional is
called ωPBE where ω corresponds to our parameter µ).
We shall not follow this procedure but come back instead
to the original formulation of the PBE functional.

We thus take for the short-range exchange energy func-

tional the PBE form

For b(˜µ) we take the coeﬃcient arising from the gradi-

with ˜µ, but the Lieb-Oxford bound is actually of no eﬀect
for large ˜µ since the GEA gradient correction vanishes
anyway and the enhancement factor reduces to 1.

contrary, we have used the exact exchange gradient ex-
pansion for ﬁnite µ and estimate the correlation gradient
expansion from it. Therefore, our µ-PBE functional does
not reduce to the original PBE functional for µ = 0.

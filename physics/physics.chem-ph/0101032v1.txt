Abstract

−

The Schr¨odinger equation (Hψ)(r) = (E + uEW (r))ψ(r) with an energy-dependent complex
uEW (r), associated with a scattering system, can be reduced for a special
absorbing potential
choice of uE to a harmonic inversion problem of a discrete pseudo-time correlation function y(t) =
φTU tφ. An eﬃcient formula for Green’s function matrix elements is also derived. Since the exact
t real matrix-vector products, this gives an
propagation up to time 2t can be done with only
unprecedently eﬃcient scheme for accurate calculations of quantum spectra for possibly very large
systems.

Complex absorbing potentials. The spectrum of a quantum scattering system can
be characterized by solving the boundary value problem associated with the Schr¨odinger
equation,

(Hψ)(r) = Eψ(r).

(1)

The bound states then have real energies E, with solutions ψ(r) exponentially localized in
space. The resonance states (Siegert states [1]) have complex energies with Im E
0. They
behave like bound states in some compact subset Ω of the conﬁguration space, but eventually
grow exponentially outside of Ω, due to the outgoing asymptotic boundary conditions.

are damped outside Ω, the physically relevant region [2]. This forces them to behave like
bound states everywhere without signiﬁcantly aﬀecting the energies E. In this framework
the physically relevant part of the system is, therefore, dissipative and satisﬁes (1) only
for r
Ω. Moreover, a general multichannel scattering problem can be considered with a
numerically convenient form of W (r), independent of the choice of coordinate system.

shall see, energy-dependent choices u = uE are particularly useful.

The introduction of the absorbing potential leads to the damped Green’s function [3–5]

Under suitable conditions on uEW (r), it is probably possible to prove, similar as in ref. [5]
for the traditional case uE = i, that GW (E) converges for any real E (and also for Im E

Practically, one usually needs to evaluate only certain matrix elements φTG(E)ψ, the basic
numerical objects of quantum physics from which most other quantities of interest (scattering
amplitudes, reaction rates, etc.) can be computed (see, e.g., refs. [3,4,6,7]). If both φ and ψ
have support in Ω, they are well approximated by φTGW (E)ψ.

Unfortunately, for very large systems with high density of states one may encounter
uEW
numerical diﬃculties when trying to diagonalize a large nonhermitian matrix H
or solve the linear system (E
H + uEW )X(E) = ψ at many values of E using general
iterative techniques for nonhermitian matrices. However, one can devise alternative iterative
techniques to solve (2) by exploiting the special structure of the quantum scattering problem.

From now on, we assume that the Hilbert space is discretized so that the states are
K matrices, W diagonal, as, e.g., in the

To simplify the following equations we further assume without loss of generality that
1 for any state ψ, where
the discretized Hamiltonian is shifted and scaled so that
iψ := ψ∗Hψ/ψ∗ψ and ∗ denotes conjugate
H
we have deﬁned the expectation value as
transposition. Such scaling is implemented routinely in the framework of the Chebyshev
polynomial expansion.

We now consider the special choice

uE = E + i√1

which after insertion into (2) gives a nonlinear eigenvalue problem for u = uE, more useful
than (2):

Hψ =

We may think of this equation as an eigenvalue problem

involving an operator-valued u-dependent energy

Hψ = E(u)ψ

E(u) =

1 + u2D
2u

that reduces in Ω (where D(r) = 1) to the constant (4).

In ref. [9] a similar nonlinear eigenvalue problem with E(u) = (D−1 + u2D)/2u was
implicitly encountered leading to a numerical scheme to compute, e.g., the complex resonance
energies by harmonic inversion of a “discrete-time” correlation function, generated by a
damped Chebyshev recursion. Here, related results are derived rigorously and in a more
general framework. In particular, a pseudo-time Schr¨odinger equation is derived that allows
one to achieve a substantial numerical saving compared to the previous works.

The eigenpairs (uk, ψk) of (5) can be used to evaluate the physically interesting quantities
(e.g., the complex resonance energies Ek, scattering amplitudes, etc.). However, because of
the nonlinearity they have somewhat diﬀerent properties from those of the regular nonher-
mitian eigenvalue problem, which we now proceed to derive.

Theorem 1: Completeness and Orthogonality. The nonlinear eigenvalue problem (5)
has at most 2K distinct eigenvalues uk. Thus, there are at most K physical eigenvalues Ek
of (2) with Im Ek ≥
If there are 2K distinct eigenvalues u1, . . . , u2K with associated eigenvectors ψk satisfying

where (uk, ψk) is an eigenpair of (5). Since conversely, any such eigenpair determines an
eigenpair of U, the nonlinear eigenvalue problem (5) has at most 2K distinct eigenvalues. If
there are 2K distinct eigenvalues u1, . . . , u2K, the matrix U is diagonalizable, and there is a
basis ˆψ1, . . . , ˆψ2K of eigenvectors of the form (12). Therefore, we may write

with uniquely determined coeﬃcients θαk. This gives (8).

Note that a similar analysis of a quadratic eigenvalue problem was carried out in ref. [10],
arising from the use of the Bloch operator L, rather than an absorbing potential. There,
equation (6) is considered with E(u) = (iuL + u2I)/2, and u is a momentum variable close
to the real axis, instead of a number close to the unit circle. However, this equation can
only be used for less general, single-channel scattering problems and, besides, it is hard to
solve eﬃciently using iterative techniques.

Reduction to a harmonic inversion problem. Consider the pseudo-time Schr¨odinger
equation deﬁned by the recurrence

φ(t) = D−1(2Hφ(t

φ(t

−

(16)

with φ(0) = φ0 and φ(1) = 0. (This choice of initial conditions is most convenient, although
other initial conditions with φ(1)
= 0 yield analogous results. A similar 3-term-recurrence
with another choice of special initial conditions leading to “modiﬁed Chebyshev recurrence”
was considered in refs. [9,11].) Since D is diagonal and matrix-vector products Hφ are
usually cheap to form, φ(0), . . . , φ(T ) are computable using O(KT ) operations and a few
vectors stored at a time. If the initial vector φ0 is real, only real arithmetic is needed.

By Theorem 1, we can write (16) as

This power expansion is very important, and is analogous to the (physical time) expan-

sion φ(t) = e−itH φ(0) =
k=1 θke−itEk ψk for the solutions of the standard time-dependent
Schr¨odinger equation. It allows one to reap all the beneﬁts of time-dependent methods (see,
e.g., refs. [12,13,6]) without having to deal with the time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation,
which is hard to solve accurately at long times t in the case of nonhermitian Hamiltonian.
Instead, only the much more benign and numerically very stable equation (16) must be
solved.

This reduces the nonlinear eigenvalue problem (5) to solving the harmonic inversion problem,
i.e., to ﬁnding the spectral parameters (uk, dαk) (k = 1, . . . , 2K) satisfying (19) for the
sequence yα(t) computed by (16) and (18). Since by (15) the sequence yα(t) is bounded
and the spectral mapping (4) moves the physically relevant eigenvalues uk close to the unit
circle, this is an eﬃciently tractable problem, even in very large dimensions [14,9].

Time doubling of an autocorrelation function. As is well known, a true time auto-
correlation function at time t can be computed by solving the time-dependent Schr¨odinger
equation up to time t/2, since one can use

C(t) := φTe−iHtφ = (e−iHt/2φ)T(e−iHt/2φ).

For the Chebyshev autocorrelation function c(t) := φT
αφ(t), based on (16) with D = I and
the initial conditions φ(0) = φ0, φ(1) = Hφ0, a factor of two saving is also well known (see,
e.g., the discussion in ref. [9]):

c(2t) = 2φ(t)Tφ(t)

c(0), c(2t + 1) = 2φ(t)Tφ(t + 1)

c(1).

This expression was used in [15] for resonance computation implementing a damped Cheby-
shev recursion. However, being approximate, it only worked for suﬃciently narrow reso-
nances. In the present framework, we can write the pseudo-time cross-correlation function
as

relation function as only φ0 is propagated.

concurrently with the computation of φ(t) using t = 0, ..., T . In exact arithmetic the har-

A formula similar to (22) was obtained (without a rigorous derivation) in ref. [16], in
the framework of the damped Chebyshev recursion in place of (16). However, here, due to
the doubling scheme (21), only half the number of matrix-vector products will be needed to
obtain the same amount of information.

Thus, we have a very eﬃcient and stable method to extract the complete spectral and dy-

publication.

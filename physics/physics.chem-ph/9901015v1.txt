Coherent nuclear motion in a condensed-phase environment: Wave-packet approach
and pump-probe spectroscopy

(Date: January 13, 2014)

A quantum-mechanical Gaussian wave-packet approach to
the theoretical description of nuclear motions in a condensed-
phase environment is developed. General expressions for the
time-dependent reduced density matrix are given for a har-
monic potential surface, and the exact quantum dynamics
is found for a microscopic system-plus-bath model. Particu-
lar attention is devoted to the inﬂuence of initial correlations
between system and bath for the outcome of a pump-probe
experiment. We show that the standard factorized prepa-
ration, compared to a more realistic correlated preparation,
leads to signiﬁcantly diﬀerent stimulated emission spectra at
high temperatures. Recent experiments for the reaction cen-
ter are analyzed using this formalism.

I. INTRODUCTION

The notion of wave packets is intimately connected
with the foundations of quantum mechanics itself. De-
spite of their importance during the initial stages of the
development of quantum theory [1], this concept has been
quickly overturned by the powerful and elegant opera-
tor formalism. Only during the past decade interest in
wave packets has emerged again, primarily triggered by
the widespread availability of ultrafast femtosecond laser
pulse techniques [2]. Wave packets are by today a stan-
dard tool employed to explain many diﬀerent features in
chemistry and physics, e.g., chemical reaction dynamics
[3–5], oscillatory motion of a coherent Bose-Einstein con-
densate [6], highly-excited Rydberg states in atoms [7],
or electron-hole excitations in semiconductors [8,9]. The
concept of wave packets is sometimes applied to ratio-
nalize experimental data even though the reaction occurs
under condensed-phase conditions, where the relevant re-
action coordinate (e.g., describing the nuclear motion) of
the wave packet (“system”) may be strongly coupled to
other modes (“environment” or “bath”). At this point
one may ask whether it makes sense to use a wave-packet
description for the reaction coordinate dynamics even if
strong coupling to solvent modes is present. First, the
description of the wave packet in terms of a wavefunc-
tion is moot, and one has to use the reduced density
matrix. Second, the bath leads to a damping of the wave
packet and could cause the complete loss of coherence.
In that case, the use of wave packets would be rather re-
stricted. It is one of the purposes of this paper to clarify
to what extent the wave-packet concept is applicable in
the presence of strong system-bath coupling.

The dissipation acting on the wave packet can have
many diﬀerent microscopic origins.
In gas-phase reac-
tions, one typically has rather weak damping due to cou-
pling to the vacuum modes of the electromagnetic ﬁeld
(spontaneous emission), or due to collisions with other
molecules. In contrast, dissipation can become decisive in
condensed-phase reactions where one has strong coupling
of the system to solvent or protein polarization modes.
Considering previous theoretical treatments of gas-phase
reactions, dissipation was mostly ignored or at best incor-
porated within the framework of the Bloch equations [10]
or the Redﬁeld equations [11], where the latter allow to
retain memory eﬀects. However, as such an approach re-
lies on perturbation theory in the system-bath coupling,
its application to condensed-phase reactions character-
ized by strong system-bath coupling remains question-
able. Other methods are based on classical molecular
dynamics (MD) simulations [12] or projection operator
techniques [5].

In general, the problem of dissipative wave-packet mo-
tion is theoretically quite demanding. In this paper, we
treat a simple model introduced in Sections II and III
but put particular emphasis on the eﬀects due to dif-
ferent initial states of the system arising in pump-probe
spectroscopy experiments. This issue is shown to be im-
portant for a correct description of experimental data
on systems in a condensed-phase environment. More
speciﬁcally, one might be tempted to assume a certain
initial preparation which is named “factorized prepara-
tion” henceforth. Under the factorized preparation, the
density matrix at t = 0 factorizes into a system part de-
scribing the wave packet, and a part corresponding to
the solvent modes. The wave packet at t = 0 could then
correspond to a pure state, e.g., a Gaussian wave packet.
Here we provide a comparison of the factorized prepara-
tion to the more realistic “correlated preparation” which
takes into account initial system-bath correlations [13].
We stress that such preparation eﬀects cannot be cap-
tured by standard “dissipative wave-packet” approaches
[3], which implicitely use the factorized preparation.

The structure of this paper is as follows. After present-
ing general expressions for Gaussian wave-packet dynam-
ics in Sec. II, the connection to microscopic system-plus-
environment models is established in Sec. III. In Sec. IV,
we then consider a pump-probe spectroscopy experiment
involving two harmonic surfaces. As a practical example,
we analyze the recent stimulated emission experiments of

1

the bacterial photosynthetic reaction center by Vos et al.
[14–16], albeit the theory is more generally applicable.
In that section, we also show that the two initial prepa-
rations mentioned above cause pronounced diﬀerences in
the emission spectra at high temperatures. Finally, some
conclusions are oﬀered in Sec. V. Technical details have
been deferred to an appendix.

II. GAUSSIAN DENSITY MATRICES

Let us start with general properties of the time evo-
lution of a Gaussian reduced density matrix ρ(t). The
Gaussian property implies that the underlying Hamilto-
nian is at most quadratic in the system coordinate (q)
and momentum (p), and imposes certain restrictions for
the system-bath coupling. However, there is neither need
to specify a Hamiltonian nor initial conditions for the
system-bath complex at this stage [except consistency
with the Gaussian form of ρ(t)]. The spatial representa-
tion of the density matrix reads

ρ(q, q′, t) = N −1(t) exp[

Σ(q, q′, t)] ,

III. MICROSCOPIC SYSTEM-PLUS-BATH
MODEL

Let us now consider a wave packet moving in a har-
monic potential surface under the inﬂuence of a bath
composed of harmonic oscillators. The harmonic oscil-
lator modes need not correspond to physical modes but
could represent eﬀective modes chosen to mimic the ac-
tual environment in an optimal way. Such a system-plus-
bath model allows us to derive exact expressions for the
, σ(t), and Θ(t) of
q(t)
independent expectation values
i
h
Sec. II, and thereby to obtain the exact quantum dy-
namics of the damped wave packet for a given spectral
density of the bath modes. In this section, the simpler
case of a factorized preparation is treated. The correlated
preparation is then discussed in Sec. IV B.

We study a system-plus-bath model [9], H = HS +
HB + HI , where the “system” part describing the un-
damped coherent nuclear motion reads

Here ρS(q) describes a pure Gaussian wave packet of

The bath is assumed to be in a thermal distribution, with
the system coordinate held ﬁxed at q = 0. While equi-
librium properties of a damped harmonic oscillator have
been studied exhaustively in the past, the consideration

3

of wave-packet initial preparations and their correspond-
ing time evolution leaves room for our contribution.

Due to the harmonic nature of the total system-plus-
bath complex, the exact time-dependent density matrix
ρ(q, q′, t) can then be directly obtained from Feynman-
Vernon theory [9,13]. Switching to symmetric and anti-
symmetric linear combinations,

x = (q + q′)/2 ,

The deﬁnition of the functions G(t), Kq(t), and Kp(t)
for an arbitrary spectral density J(ω) can be found in
the appendix. From these expressions, one veriﬁes that
iβ [9] are
the correct equilibrium values σβ and
approached at long times.
Using the ohmic spectral density (3.4), we now discuss
the question of coherence of the damped wave packet.
Above a critical value γc of the damping strength γ,
where γc follows from Eq. (A14), oscillations in

disappear and only incoherent relaxation can take place,
ω0, the critical damping strength
see Figure 1. For ωD ≫
is given by γc = 2ω0 [9]. While this limit is of most in-
terest in solid-state applications, the regime ωD ≈
ω0 as
well as ωD ≪
ω0 has many applications in chemical sys-
tems. Interestingly, the value of γc increases when ωD/ω0
0, the dynamics is al-
becomes small. In fact, for ωD →
. In that limit, the bath is

too slow to cause relaxational behavior. It is noteworthy
that the precise value of γc depends on the quantity con-
sidered in deﬁning coherence. Taking the disappearance
of the inelastic peaks in the spectral function as the rel-
evant criterion leads to a critical value that is smaller by
a factor 1/√2 [17]. Since our coherence criterion is based

ticle, the coherent-to-incoherent transition occurs at the
same damping strength γc for a wave packet and a point-
like particle.
In particular, γc takes a temperature-
independent value.

Next we brieﬂy discuss the time dependence of the vari-
ance σ(t), see Figure 2, and of the Shannon entropy S(t),
see Figure 3. The initial width σ0 of the wave packet

comes very pronounced if σ0 strongly deviates from the
natural width σβ of the damped oscillator. Furthermore,
initial transient oscillations then persist for a longer time.
They are particularly pronounced for low temperatures
and small σ0, with a transient entropy large compared to
the equilibrium value S(t

IV. PUMP-PROBE SPECTROSCOPY OF THE
REACTION CENTER

Next we apply the results presented before in a speciﬁc
context. The system under study is the photosynthetic
reaction center in purple bacteria. In recent pump-probe
experiments on modiﬁed and wild-type reaction centers,
Vos et al. [14–16] have observed oscillations in the time-
resolved emission signal, which were interpreted to re-
ﬂect coherent nuclear motion in the excited electronic
state (“vibrational coherence”). This observation im-
mediately received much attention, as coherent dynam-
ics was not expected to exist in such a condensed-phase
system. Clearly, a nuclear coordinate within a macro-
molecule like the reaction center could be drastically in-
ﬂuenced by dissipation, which suggests a treatment sim-
ilar to the one discussed above. The situation that Vos
et al. constructed from their data is depicted in Fig. 4.
The excited state surface was found to be parabolic with
a curvature of ω0 = 75 cm−1. It was populated with a
870 nm pump pulse, say, at time t = 0, and probed with
pulses around 921.5 nm, corresponding to the minimum
of the excited state surface. In this section, we expand on
the above analysis in order to describe the emission sig-
nal. Thereby eﬀects of the spectral density characteris-
tics and of the initial correlations can be captured, where
especially the latter are missed by any simpler formalism.
In order to clearly show these initial correlation eﬀects,
we shall crudely simplify the modelling of the pump (and
to a lesser extent of the probe) pulse. In particular, we

make the (strictly speaking unphysical) assumption that
the pump pulse transfers the complete nuclear wave
packet up to the excited state surface. Therefore we only
have to treat the dissipative excited state dynamics up to
the probe pulse. Of course, thereby potentially important
eﬀects like the impulsive resonance Raman contribution
[4,5,18] are missed. However, in principle our theory can
straightforwardly be extended to provide a more realistic
modelling of the pump and probe processes.

HB, see Eq. (3.2). Since we only consider the dynamics
on the excited state surface between the pump and the
probe pulse, it is not necessary to account for dissipation
in the ground state at t > 0. The eﬀect of the probe pulse
is described by V (t). Under the dipole and the rotating

of 2δ = 20 fs.

The model parameters were taken as follows. The
frequency of the excited [ground] state surface is ω0 =
75 cm−1 [ωG = 130 cm−1]. Furthermore, q0 and ¯hω∆
are calculated from the wavelength of the pump pulse,
λpu = 870 nm, and of the probe pulse acting at q = q0,
λpr = 921.5 nm. The parabolic geometry of Fig. 4 then

dissipation acting on the reaction coordinate q. In prin-
ciple, one should ﬁrst compute the appropriate spectral
density for the system under consideration by means of
MD simulations [19]. In the absence of such information,
we make the assumption of an ohmic bath with a Drude
cutoﬀ, see Eq. (3.4). This spectral density was shown to
be in agreement with the overall structure of the spectral
density coupling to the primary electron transfer step in
the reaction center [19]. To account for the lack of knowl-
edge concerning the spectral density, we have studied two
diﬀerent spectral parameter sets. The ﬁrst one, which is
referred to as SP I, is γ/2ω0 = 0.1 and ωD/ω0 = 100.
The second one, referred to as SP II, is γ/2ω0 = 0.75
and ωD/ω0 = 0.5. Both sets are within the coherent
regime, γ < γc(ωD), and are chosen such that the oscil-
lations in
decay on the same time scale as those of
the T = 10 K emission signal reported in Ref. [14].

B. Initial preparation

A conceptually more severe point concerns the proper
description of the initial state (t = 0). Again, two very
diﬀerent initial preparations are conceivable. The ﬁrst
one is to assume a wave packet in the usual sense, where
the oscillator is initially in a pure state without correla-
tions with the bath. This is the “factorized preparation”
elaborated in Sec. III and (at least implicitely) employed
in most previous treatments. On the other hand, the
nuclear coordinate already experiences the environment
while the system is in the ground state, and therefore the
initial density matrix does not factorize. A more realis-
tic preparation is to take the
oscillator at equilibrium

with the same bath as in the excited state, whence there
will be system-bath correlations at t = 0 (“correlated
preparation”). We mention in passing that the corre-
lated preparation is related to the initial bath preparation
discussed in Ref. [20] in the context of electron transfer

Due to its very short duration, as a result of the pump
pulse at t = 0, the system is assumed to suddenly change
from the ground state to the excited state surface. This
amounts to both a vertical shift and a change in curvature
ω0, see Fig. 4. Technically speaking, the correlated
ωG →
preparation can be most conveniently accounted for by
following the path-integral analysis of Ref. [13], but keep-
ing diﬀerent system potentials acting on the imaginary-
time and real-time paths. The resulting reduced density
matrix is then of the form (3.7) again. Due to the Ehren-
fest theorem,

For both preparations, the initial width σ(t = 0) was
chosen as the thermal width σG

value, the time-dependence of the variance is strikingly
diﬀerent depending on the initial condition. This be-
comes particularly evident for ωG = ω0, where for the

to time-dependent variances. This can be understood
by noting that

ration. Since the deviation in
for the two
initial preparations becomes larger with increasing tem-
peratures, one expects that the choice of the correct ini-
tial preparation is more important at high temperatures.
This is indeed conﬁrmed by the results for the stimulated
emission signal reported below.

C. Calculating the emission signal

Next we calculate the time-dependent total stimulated
emission signal. After the pump pulse at t = 0, the sys-
tem is assumed to be in the excited state surface accord-
ing to a properly chosen initial preparation. The probe
pulse is then assumed to be much faster than typical sol-
vent time scales such that the environmental inﬂuence
can be neglected during the emission process itself. The
time-dependent emission signal can thus be expressed in
terms of the reduced density matrix directly before and
after the application of the probe pulse. For a probe
pulse centered at time t with duration 2δ, the energy
E(t) emitted during the transition is

E(t) =

In principle, the above analysis can straightforwardly
be extended in order to incorporate the pump pulse. The
resulting initial reduced density matrix is then composed
of four diﬀerent contributions, namely those in Eq. (4.5)
and the two nondiagonal terms. The subsequent time
evolution with both electronic surfaces coupled to the
bath could then be treated in a similar way as presented
in Sec. III.

D. Results for the reaction center

Figure 5 shows the time-resolved stimulated emission
signal for diﬀerent probe wavelengths λpr at T = 10 K. At
such a low temperature, the diﬀerence between the fac-
torized and correlated preparation is very small and can
hardly be resolved in Fig. 5. The qualitative features of
the emission signal can be understood within the wave-
packet picture by relating λpr to a particular value of
the nuclear coordinate q, as is seen by plotting the dis-
crete Fourier-transformed emission spectrum A(λpr) at
the frequency ˜ω corresponding to the ground oscillation,
see Fig. 6. This frequency, determined from the imag-
inary part of the roots of Eq. (A12), is 97.2 cm−1 for
SP II but deviates less than 1% from ω0 for SP I. The
maxima in A(λpr) then correspond to the left (q = 0)
and right (q = 2q0) turning points of the undamped nu-
clear wave-packet, while the minimum is related to the
bottom of the potential surface (q = q0) in Fig. 4. Due to
the ﬁnite pulse duration and the diﬀerent Franck-Condon
overlap factors for q > q0 and q < q0, the correspond-
ing value of λpr diﬀers from 921.5 nm, particularly at
high temperatures. Since the turning points are passed
once per period but the bottom is visited twice, the cor-

responding emission signals should be oscillatory with
frequency ˜ω and 2˜ω, respectively [14]. This behavior is
indeed found in Fig. 5. Focusing on SP I, the emission sig-
nal at λpr = 1000 nm, corresponding to the right turning
point, exhibits a phase shift of π and a smaller ampli-
tude compared to λpr = 870 nm. This can be explained
by noting that the right turning point is reached half a
period later than the left one, whence the most signiﬁ-
cant initial contribution is damped more strongly. Apart

from the decay of the oscillations in E(t), damping of
the nuclear motion is also reﬂected in a ﬁnite amplitude
A(λpr) > 0 at the minimum. For wavelengths λpr away
from the turning points or the bottom, there are two dif-
ferent time intervals between subsequent passings of the
transition region. This leads to the splitting of the max-
ima in the short-time emission signal observed in Fig. 5.
With increasing temperature, according to our argu-
mentation above, the inﬂuence of the initial preparation
should become more and more important. This is seen in
the temperature dependence of the spectrum and of the
emission signal shown in Figures 6 and 7, respectively.
We ﬁrst focus on the eﬀects seen in Fig. 6. The mini-
mum of A(λpr) shifts towards higher wavelengths with
increasing temperature. This can be rationalized by not-
ing that for ω0 < ωG, the energy gap between the nth
vibronic eigenstates of the excited and ground state de-
creases with n, and that high-order eigenstates become
more important in the spectral decomposition of ρ(t) at

higher temperatures. In fact, additional calculations for
ωG = ω0/2 [not shown here] yield a similar shift towards
smaller λpr. This shift is more pronounced for the cor-
related initial preparation, but depends only weakly on
the spectral density of the environmental modes.

Figure 7 shows the temperature dependence of the
emission signal at λpr = 950 nm, corresponding to
q0 < q < 2q0, with q approaching the bottom q = q0
as the temperature is increased. Furthermore, Figure 8
shows that σ(t) under the factorized preparation experi-
ences a phase shift of almost π at T > 100 K compared
to the correlated preparation. Such an unphysical phase
shift arises as a relict of the unperturbed evolution of a
harmonic oscillator. Furthermore, since σ(0) = σG
β in-
creases with temperature, a negative initial slope results
under the factorized preparation, see Eq. (3.11). No-
tably, for the correlated preparation, the maxima in E(t)
stay always close to the equilibrium values, in marked
contrast to the factorized preparation but in accordance
with the experimental data of Ref. [14]. A similar be-
havior is seen in the variance shown in Fig. 8. For the
correlated preparation, the maxima in σ(t) occur every
(k + 1/2)th period, corresponding to the passing of the
bottom q = q0, and they are very close to their equilib-
rium value σE
β . Therefore, for the correlated preparation,
the independent expectation values
and σ(t) are al-
ways close to their equilibrium values when passing the
bottom q = q0. On the other hand, for the factorized
preparation, the phase shift in σ(t) results in a bunching
of the wave packet when passing the bottom. This causes
even qualitatively diﬀerent emission signals. We conclude
that at high temperatures several unphysical eﬀects are
introduced by using a factorized initial preparation, and
a wrong description of the emission spectrum may result.

V. CONCLUSIONS

In this work, we have formulated a dissipative wave-
packet approach towards a detailed theoretical descrip-
tion of stimulated emission pump-probe experiments un-
der condensed-phase conditions. Assuming harmonic
surfaces for both the ground and the excited state, the
Gaussian nature of the wave packet describing the coher-
ent nuclear motion allows for an exact treatment even
if strong damping by environmental modes is present.
Modelling the environmental modes by a set of inﬁnitely
many eﬀective harmonic oscillators with a suitably cho-
sen spectral density, it is then possible to make detailed
predictions for the stimulated emission signal and for the
corresponding spectra. While the spectral density is in
principle accessible in terms of MD simulations, we have
studied two model spectral densities in this work. A par-
ticular advantage of our approach is the possibility of
treating diﬀerent initial preparations of the wavepacket-
plus-bath complex directly after the pump pulse (t = 0).
A more realistic calculation should also explicitely study
the pump pulse, which can in principle be done along

9

the same lines. Under such a formalism, a correct choice
for the initial preparation of the wavepacket-plus-bath
complex before the pump pulse will be important and is
expected to lead to similar eﬀects.

The recent experiments by Vos et al. [14–16] on the
bacterial photosynthetic reaction center have been an-
alyzed using this formalism. Due to our assumptions
about the pump pulse, the possibly important impul-
sive resonant Raman contribution was not taken into ac-
count here. While some of the qualitative features of the
coherent nuclear motion have been discussed before us-
ing simpler arguments [14], our approach can allow for
a fully quantum-mechanical comparison of experimental
data with theory. Even in the absence of detailed knowl-
edge about the environmental spectral density, conclu-
sions of relevance to the interpretation of experimental
results can be extracted from our analysis. In particular,
we have shown that at high temperatures, the assump-
tion of a factorized initial state leads to large diﬀerences
from the theoretical predictions under a more realistic
correlated initial state.

Finally it should be stressed that the approach pre-
sented here can be applied to other pump-probe spec-
troscopy setups as well. In particular, if the excited state
surface is weakly coupled to another surface, as happens,
e.g., in the primary electron transfer step in the reaction
center, transitions to this surface are expected to modify
the emission signal. A theoretical description of such a
situation can be given in terms of spin-boson type models
[20] and will be elaborated elsewhere.

This appendix contains the expressions for the vari-

For a factorized preparation, the three independent ex-

Next we brieﬂy discuss the case of an ohmic bath with

From Eq. (A13) we arrive at the simple result G(t) =

lengthy but can be straightforwardly obtained by follow-
ing the above steps, we refrain from quoting them here.
To locate the coherent-to-incoherent transition, we
note that the cubic equation (A12) has either three real
solutions, or one real and two complex conjugate ones.
In the latter case, G(t) and therefore
will exhibit
coherent oscillations. The critical value γc then follows
from the condition D(¯γ, ¯ωD) = 0, where ¯γ = γ/ω0,
¯ωD = ωD/ω0, and

For arbitrary ω0 and ωD, there is exactly one positive

Abstract

Precise numerical calculations of bound states of three-atomic He-
lium cluster are performed. The modern techniques of solution of Fad-
deev equations are combined to obtain an eﬃcient numerical scheme.
Binding energies and other observables for ground and excited states
are calculated. Geometric properties of the clusters are discussed.

1 Introduction

Small clusters of Helium attract the attention of specialists in diﬀerent ﬁelds
of physics. Fine experimental techniques are developed to observe these
clusters [1, 2, 3]. Diﬀerent quantum chemistry approaches are used to pro-
duce numerous potential models of He-He interaction [17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22].
Model-free Monte-Carlo calculations were performed to check the accuracy
of the models [23]. The special attention is payed to three-body Helium
clusters [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11] because of their possible near-Eﬁmov behavior
[4]. Complicated shape of the model potentials also makes Helium trimer a
perfect touchstone for the computational methods of three-body bound state
calculations [13].

Although the investigation of He3 lasts already more than 20 years [5],
some important physical questions has not received deﬁnite answer yet. One
of the questions is dealt with speculations on Eﬁmov-like nature of the He3
bound states: how many excited states are supported by the best known
model interactions? Can one estimate any diﬀerences in the number of bound
states varying the model potentials being limited by the accuracy of contem-
porary models? Another important question is dealt with the characteristics
of He3 bound states. Can He3 trimers inﬂuence the results of experimental
measurement of He2 dimer characteristics? To answer these questions one
should know such important characteristics of the He3 cluster as the mean
square radius of diﬀerent states of the trimer and its geometric shape.

In this paper we investigate the 4He trimer performing direct calculations
of 4He3 bound states with diﬀerent He-He model potentials. We base our
calculations on Faddeev equations in conﬁguration space because of simplic-
ity of numerical approximation of Faddeev components in comparison with
a wave function. In the case of Faddeev equations the boundary conditions
are also much simpler.

In the following sections the equations we have solved numerically are
described, some observables for diﬀerent states of He3 and for He2 are pre-
sented.

2 Faddeev equations for bound states

According to the Faddeev formalism [14] the wave function of three particles
is expressed in terms of Faddeev components Φ

Ψ(x1, y1) = Φ1(x1, y1) + Φ2(x2, y2) + Φ3(x3, y3) ,

(1)

where xα and yα are Jackobi coordinates corresponding to the ﬁxed pair α

xα = (

2mβmγ
mβ + mγ

)

2 (rβ −

rγ) ,

yα = (

2mα(mβ + mγ)
mα + mβ + mγ

1

)

2 (rα −

mβrβ + mγrγ
mβ + mγ

) .

(2)

Here rα are the positions of the particles in the center-of-mass frame. The
Faddeev components obey the set of three equations

α = 1, 2, 3

where Vα(xα) stands for pairwise potential. To make this system of equa-
tions suitable for numerical calculations one should take into account the
symmetries of the physical system. Exploiting the identity of Helium atoms
in the trimer one can reduce the equations (3) to one equation [14]. Since
all the model potentials are central it is possible to factor out the degrees
of freedom corresponding to the rotations of the whole cluster [15]. For the
case of zero total angular momentum the reduced Faddeev equation reads

E3, E2 is the energy of the two-body bound state and E3 is the
energy of the three-body system. The second term corresponding to virtual
decay of three body bound state into three single particles decreases much
faster than the ﬁrst one which corresponds to virtual decay into a particle
and two-body cluster. In our calculations we neglect the second term in the
asymptotics introducing the following approximate boundary conditions for
the Faddeev component at suﬃciently large distances Rx and Ry

To calculate the bound state energy and the corresponding Faddeev com-
ponent one has to solve the equation (4) with the approximate boundary
condition (6). The numerical scheme we have chosen to perform the calcula-
tions is based on tensor-trick algorithm [16]. In this paper we do not describe
the realization of the numerical methods exploited but only underline some
essential features of our approach. They are

1. total angular momentum representation [15],

2. tensor-trick algorithm [16],

3. Cartesian coordinates [10].

The total angular momentum representation itself is a strong method of par-
tial analysis allowing to take into account contribution of all the angular
momentum states of two-body subsystems at once [15]. Tensor-trick algo-
rithm [16] is known to be a powerful method of solution of Faddeev equations
for bound states. Being applied to the equations in total angular momentum
representation it leads to eﬀective computational scheme which makes pos-
sible to use all the advantages of Cartesian coordinates. In particular using
Cartesian coordinates [10] one can obtain a criterion to select the optimal
grid in the coordinate x. This criterion comes from the asymptotic behavior
of Faddeev component

Φ(x, y, z)

ϕ2(x)e−

kyy ,

∼

4

where ϕ2(x) is the two-body bound state wave function. That is why the
properly chosen grid in x should support the correct two-body wave func-
tion. Comparing the binding energy of two-body subsystem calculated on the
”three-body” grid with the exact results one can estimate the lower bound
for a numerical error of a three-body calculation.

Thus the usage of total angular momentum representation has allowed
us to construct an eﬃcient numerical scheme combining the most advanced
methods proposed during the last decade.

3 Results of calculations

Having the equation (4) solved numerically one has the value of the en-
ergy of 3-body state E3 and the corresponding Faddeev component Φ(x, y, z)
for a particular model potential. Comparing the observables calculated for
diﬀerent potential models one can estimate the bounds limiting the values
of these observables for the real system. Eight diﬀerent potential models
were used in our calculations: HFD-HE2 [18], HFD-B(He) [19], LM2M1 [20],
LM2M2 [20], HFDID [20], LM2M1 and LM2M2 without add-on correction
term [20], TTYPT [22]. In the Tab. 1 we give the values of trimer energies
for ground and excited states. To conﬁrm the accuracy of our calculation
we also present the values of dimer binding energy calculated on the grid
used in three-body calculations ˜E2 and the exact results E2. The diﬀerence
between these values can be regarded as the lower bound for the error of
our approach. In the Tabs. 2 and 3 we demonstrate the convergence of the
calculated energies with respect to the number of grid points used in the
calculations. The results of other authors for the most known potentials are
given in the Tab. 7. The best agreement is observed with the results of [8]
and [11]. In the ref. [8] no angular momentum cut-oﬀ is made, that makes it
the closest one to our approach. In all other papers some kind of partial wave
decomposition is performed and ﬁnite number of angular basic functions is
taken into account. The most complete basis is used in the ref.
[11]. The
agreement between our calculations and the result of [11] for the excited state
is impressive, but the ground state energy of [11] is about one percent less
than our result. Consideration of the geometric properties of Helium trimer
can clarify the possible nature of this diﬀerence.

Since the Faddeev component is calculated, the wave function can be

5

recovered as follows

ψ(x, y, z) = Φ(x, y, z) + xy (

Φ(x+, y+, z+)
x+y+

+

Φ(x−, y−, z−)
x−y−

) ,

where x± = C ±x and y± = C ±y. Having the wave function recovered one
can investigate the shape properties of the system. The most intuitive way
to visualize the results of the calculations is to draw a one-particle density
function deﬁned as

ρ(r1) = Z

dr2dr3

Ψ(r1, r2, r3)

|

2 ,

|

where

Ψ(r1, r2, r3) =

ψ(x(r1, r2, r3), y(r1, r2, r3), z(r1, r2, r3))
4π3x(r1, r2, r3)y(r1, r2, r3)

,

the functions x(r1, r2, r3), y(r1, r2, r3) and z(r1, r2, r3) are deﬁned according
to (2) and (5), the function ψ(x, y, z) is normalized to unit. Due to the
symmetry of the system the one-particle density function is a function of the
coordinate only. Taking into account the relation r1 = √3y1 we
r1 =

Omitting the integration over z we deﬁne a conditional density function
ρ(r, z) that presents a spatial distribution for the particle 1 when the other
two particles are located along the ﬁxed axis. It is useful to plot this func-
tion in coordinates (rl, ra) such that rl = rz is a projection of the particle 1
position to the axis connecting the other particles and ra = z
2 is
z
|
a projection to the orthogonal axis. Three-dimensional plots of the function
ρ((r2
) corresponding to the ground and excited states
of the trimer calculated with LM2M2 potential are presented on the Fig. 1
and Fig. 2. The conditional density function of the ground state decreases
democratically in all the directions. The density function of the excited state
has two distinguishable maximums demonstrating the linear structure of the
cluster. This structure has a simple physical explanation. The most probable
positions of a particle in the excited state lie around two other particles. At
the distances where two particles are well separated the third one forms a
dimer-like bound state with each of them. This interpretation agrees with

Tab. 5 demonstrate the dominating role of a two-body contribution to the
trimer excited state whereas in the ground state this contribution is rather
small. We could suppose that this dominating contribution of the cluster
wave in the excited state has ensured fast convergence of the hyperspherical
adiabatic expansion in the paper [11] to the correct value, but to get the
same order of accuracy for the ground state possibly more basic functions
should be taken into account.

Very demonstrative example of the advantage of Faddeev equations over
the Schroedinger one in bound-state calculations is given in the Tabs. 8 and 9.
Here we present the contribution of diﬀerent angular states to the Faddeev
component and to the wave function calculated as

where Pn(z) are the normalized Legendre polynomials, F (x, y, z) is the Fad-
deev component or the wave function, n = 0, 2, 4. The angular coeﬃcients
for the Faddeev component decrease much faster than the wave function co-
eﬃcients. The Tab. 8 also demonstrates that more angular functions should
be taken into account in the ground state calculations.

4 Conclusions

The high accuracy calculations of He3 bound states were performed on the
base of the most advanced few-body calculations techniques. Eight diﬀerent
potential models were used. For every potential model, either more (LM2M2,
TTYPT) or less realistic one (LM2M2a, HFD-ID), two and only two bound
states are found. The properties of these states are very diﬀerent. The
ground state is strongly bound, whereas the binding energy of the excited
state is comparable with the binding energy of dimer. The sizes of these two

7

or

states also diﬀers much. The characteristic size of the ground state either
1/2 (Tabs. 5 and 6) is approximately 10 times less
estimated by
than the size of dimer molecule, but the size of the excited state has the
same order of magnitude with the dimer’s one. This estimation shows the
necessity to check for the absence of trimers in the experimental media during
the measurement of dimer properties and vice versa.

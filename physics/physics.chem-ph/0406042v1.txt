Chemical reactivity of ultracold polar molecules: investigation of

H + HCl and H + DCl collisions

Abstract. Quantum scattering calculations are reported for the H + HCl(v, j = 0) and H + DCl(v, j = 0)

collisions for vibrational levels v = 0 − 2 of the diatoms. Calculations were performed for incident kinetic

energies in the range 10−7 − 10−1 eV, for total angular momentum J = 0 and s-wave scattering in

the entrance channel of the collisions. Cross sections and rate coeﬃcients are characterized by resonance

structures due to quasibound states associated with the formation of the H· · ·HCl and H· · ·DCl van der

Waals complexes in the incident channel. For the H+HCl(v, j = 0) collision for v = 1, 2, reactive scattering

leading to H2 formation is found to dominate over non-reactive vibrational quenching in the ultracold

regime. Vibrational excitation of HCl from v = 0 to v = 2 increases the zero-temperature limiting rate

coeﬃcient by about 8 orders of magnitude.

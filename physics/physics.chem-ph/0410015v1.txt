ABSTRACT

We present explicit form of non - adiabatic coupling (NAC) elements of nuclear Schroedinger equa-

tion (SE) for a coupled tri - state electronic manifold in terms of mixing angles of real electronic

basis functions. If the adiabatic - diabatic transformation (ADT) angles are the mixing angles of

electronic basis, ADT matrix transforms NAC terms to exactly zeros and brings diabatic form of

SE. ADT and NAC matrices satisfy a curl condition and ﬁnd a novel relation among the mixing

angles for irrotational case. We also ﬁnd that extended Born - Oppenheimer (EBO) equations have

meaningful solution and can reproduce numerically exact results only when the equations are gauge

invariant.

Herzberg and Longuet - Higgins (HLH) [1] made an interesting observation in molecular dynamics

- a real valued electronic wavefunction changes sign when the nuclear coordinates encircles a closed

path around a conical intersection. This is so - called geometric phase (GP) eﬀect, where the total

wavefunction is not well behaved and the Born - Oppenheimer (BO) treatment [2] breaks down.

HLH corrected this problem in an ad hoc way by multiplying a complex phase factor with real

double - valued electronic wavefunction such that the resulting complex electronic wavefunction is

single valued. Mead and Truhlar [3] generalized the BO equation by introducing a vector potential

into the nuclear Hamiltonian to account this eﬀect and the approach is reminiscent of HLH complex

phase factor treatment. The eﬀect has been found to show up immense signiﬁcance, particularly,

in scattering processes[4].

The BO treatment is based on the fact that slow - moving nuclei can be distinguished from fast

- moving electrons in molecular systems. This distinction leads to the BO approximation, which

includes the assumption that NAC terms are negligibly small and the upper electronic states do

not aﬀect the wavefunction on the lower state. Though the implication of this assumption is

considered to be independent on the energy of the system, the ordinary BO equation was also

applied for cases with large NAC terms assuming that upper electronic states are classically closed

at low energies. Even if the components of total wavefunction on the upper electronic state(s) are

negligibly small at enough low energies, their product with large NAC terms are deﬁnite values and

the BO approximation breaks down for those cases.

Since NAC terms appear as oﬀ - diagonal elements in the SE [5], formulations of EBO equation

are the attempts [6-7] to include the eﬀect of oﬀ - diagonal (non - adiabatic) elements on the

single surface equation. Baer [7] derived a new set of potential energy coupled BO equations for

two electronic states, where the eﬀects of NAC terms are being translated on the diagonal. At

enough low energy, Baer assumed that upper electronic state is classically closed and approximate

EBO equations for both the surfaces were formed. This EBO equation was used to calculate

transition probabilities in a two - arrangement - channel model [8-9] and reproduced the correct

results obtained from rigorously derived diabatic SE. Varandas and Xu [10] expressed NAC elements

of adiabatic nuclear SE in terms of nuclear coordinate dependent mixing angle of two real electronic

wavefunctions, found that ADT angle [11] is identical (up to an additive constant) with the mixing

2

angle and indeed, formulated single surface EBO equations in the vicinity of degeneracy.

Baer et al. [12-13] considered coupled BO equations for N (

2) adiabatic nuclear SE and derived

single surface EBO equations for a model situation ( not a general case). These EBO equations

contain the eﬀect of NAC terms where the ground adiabatic PES have a degeneracy with excited

surfaces along a single line. Even though this derivation was not persuaded for a general situation,

the formulation shows that such an extension is viable and those EBO equations will have meaningful

≥

solution only when they are gauge invariant.

In this article, we carry out the BO treatment of a coupled three state electronic manifold from ﬁrst

principles. The BO expansion of molecular wavefunction and the total electron - nuclei Hamiltonian

in the adiabatic representation are given by:

Ψ(n, e) =

ψi(n)ξi(e, n),

function of the electronic Hamiltonian, ˆHe(e, n) with eigenvalue, ui(n), also ψi(n) is the nuclear
coordinate dependent expansion coeﬃcient and ˆTn is the nuclear kinetic energy (KE) operator.
When we substitute equation (1) in the time - independent SE and multiply by electronic ba-

sis, ξi(e, n), the matrix representation of adiabatic nuclear equation takes the following form after

integrating over the electronic coordinates, e,

with the general form of incomplete elliptic integral of the second kind. It is quite obvious that since

α(n) (A is analytic) is analytic, the nature of these integrals will be generic for any functional form

of α(n). When three electronic states are coupled, the non - adiabatic eﬀect of the upper states on

the ground is equivalent to a potential developed due to elliptic motion of the nuclei around the

point of conical intersection. Moreover, single surface EBO can be derived only for speciﬁc ratios of

mixing/ADT angles, e.g., gauge invariance condition is approximately obeyed in case (a), whereas

in the cases (b) and (c), integrals are either away or far away from the gauge condition.

probabilities. Dynamical calculations are carried out at total energy 1.20 and 1.80 eV. Since the

point of conical intersection is at 3.0 eV, upper electronic states are expected to be classically

closed at those energies. We demonstrate all the results in Table (I) - (III) for the cases (a) -

EBO equations not only follow the correct symmetry but also achieve quantitative agreement with

diabatic results whereas in Table (II) and (III), single surface EBO results are symmetry broken as

well as inaccurate. Thus, these numerical results predict that only for the case (a), single surface

EBO equation can be constructed.

In summary, we have used the generalized form of real orthogonal electronic basis functions in terms

of mixing angles (α(n), β(n) and γ(n)) among the three electronic states and expressed the NAC

terms of adiabatic nuclear SEs with these angles. When ADT angles are chosen as mixing angles,

adiabatic nuclear SEs transform to diabatic SEs, i.e, ADT and mixing angles are equal upto an

additive constant. Since the NAC (~τ ), ADT (A) matrices satisfy the ADT condition and mixing

angles are analytic, we ﬁnd a curl condition is also satisﬁed with non - zero divergence for each

element of ~τ matrix. In irrotational case, solution of these curl equations imply that mixing/ADT

angles are related with integer ratios. Consequently, both the adiabatic and diabatic nuclear SEs are

being simpliﬁed extensively. Single surface EBO equations derived from adiabatic nuclear SEs have

meaningful solution and quantitative agreement with corresponding diabatic case only for speciﬁc

ratios of mixing angles where EBO equation is gauge invariant and provide uniquely deﬁned diabatic

potential energy matrix. We also ﬁnd that the non - adiabatic eﬀect associated with single surface

EBO equation derived from three coupled electronic state is a potential that arises due to the elliptic

motion of nuclei around the conical intersection.

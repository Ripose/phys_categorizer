The stretching and bending vibrational spectrum and the intensities of infrared

transitions in a tetrahedral molecule are studied in two boson-realization models, where

the interactions between stretching and bending vibrations are described by a quadratic

cross term and by Fermi resonance terms, called harmonically coupled and Fermi

resonance boson-realization model, respectively. The later is a development of our

recent model. As an example, the two models are applied to the overtone spectrum

and the intensities of silicon tetraﬂuorde. Those models provide ﬁts to the published
−1 and 0.908
−1, respectively. The intensities of infrared transitions of its complete vibrations

experimental vibrational eigenvalues with standard deviations 1.956 cm

cm

are calculated in the two models, and results show a good agreement with the observed

data.

I. INTRODUCTION

In recent years, algebraic methods have been introduced for a description of rotation-vibrational

spectra of molecules. A U(4) algebraic model [1] was successfully used to explain the rotation-

vibrational states of diatomic molecules. This model was developed for studying small molecules

by introducing a U(4) algebra for each bond [2,3]. It was also suggested to use a U(k + 1) model [4]

for the k = 3m − 3 rotational and vibrational degrees of freedom of m-atomic molecules. Those two

models have an advantage that they can treat rotations and vibrations simultaneously, but they are

quite complex for larger molecules. A U(n) algebraic approach [5] was also used for a treatment of

n − 1 stretching vibrational degrees of freedom in polyatomic molecules. Iachello and Oss presented a

SU(2) algebraic model based on isomorphism between the one-dimensional Morse oscillator and the

SU(2) algebra, which was particularly well suited for dealing with the stretching vibrations of poly-

atomic molecules such as the octahedral and benzene-like systems [6]. The U(4) and SU(2) algebraic

models were even modiﬁed by the corresponding quantum algebraic ones [7,8] for diatomic molecules.

Incorporating the bending modes in algebraic models for large molecules was not achieved until

1993, when Iachello and Oss proposed a U(2) algebraic model for describing P¨oschl-Teller oscillator

that was well suitable for bending vibrations [9]. They extended this method to treat coupled bending
modes [10]. Frank et al. presented a symmetry-adapted algebraic model [11-13], which described the

stretching and bending vibrations in terms of U(2) algebra and made a clear connection between the

algebraic approaches and the traditional methods in the conﬁguration space. In a diﬀerent way, by
making use of the bosonic operators for describing vibrations, Ma et al. have recently introduced

an algebraic model of boson realization [14] for the complete vibrational modes, and obtained the

satisfactory results for some molecules [15,16].

In this paper we will further investigate both the complete vibrations and the intensities of infrared

transitions in a tetrahedral molecule in two boson-realization models. The ﬁrst model is the model

that we proposed recently [14], where the interactions between the stretch and the bend are harmon-

ically coupled. Let us refer this model as a harmonically coupled boson-realization model (HCBM).

The second model is called Fermi resonance boson-realization model (FRBM), where the interactions

between two kinds of vibrations are described by Fermi resonances. As an example of their appli-

cations, we study the vibrational spectrum of silicon tetraﬂuorde SiF4 in two models. HCBM with

seven parameters and FRBM with ten parameters provide ﬁts to the observed values with the stan-
dard deviation 1.956 cm−1 and 0.908 cm−1, respectively. Furthermore, we propose another FRBM

with only seven parameters, where the standard deviation is still about half of that in HCBM with

the same number of parameters. It shows that FRBM is more suitable for highly excited states in

this molecule. In addition, intensities of infrared transitions of both the stretching and the bending

vibrational spectrum in this molecule are calculated in the two models, and indicate a good agreement

with the experimental values.

The organization of this paper is as follows. Sec.

II is devoted to construct the symmetrized

bases and identify the spurious states. In Sec. III the vibrational Hamiltonian in the two models are

2

introduced in terms of ten sets of boson operators and applied to the vibrational spectrum of silicon

tetraﬂuoride SiF4. Its intensities of infrared transitions in the two models are presented in Sec. IV.

Conclusion is made in Sec. V.

II. SYMMETRIZED BASES AND SPURIOUS STATES

In calculating spectra of polyatomic molecules one needs to construct a basis in which the Hamil-

tonian matrix is a block matrix. The symmetry adapted bases are widely used for this purpose.

Halonen and Child [17] gave symmetrized local mode basis functions for stretching vibrations of sym-
metry molecules by a combination of promotion operators and Schmidt orthogonalization. Frank et
al. [11-13] ﬁrst constructed the symmetrized bases by projecting the one-phonon local functions, and

then obtained the higher-phonon functions from the one-phonon symmetrized states by the Clebsch-

Gordan coeﬃcients. This method is quite complex when describing vibrations of large molecules and

for high overtones. In this case, the symmetry adapted bases can be achieved by a new technique

for constructing representations of the molecular symmetry point groups, that was recently called

symmetrized boson representations [18]. This new technique has merits that the basis vectors of those

representations have a clear physical picture, and that their combinations are much simpler and gen-

eral for multiple-phonon states. In this way we constructed the symmetrized bases for a tetrahedral

molecule [14]. We hereby outline them for completeness.

For a tetrahedral molecule XY4 there are four stretching oscillators and six bending oscillators. As

in our previous paper [14], let the atom X locate at the center O of the tetrahedron, and the four

atoms Y at its vertices A, B, C, and D. The coordinate axes x, y, and z point from O to the centers of

edges AC, AD, and AB, respectively. The four stretching oscillators OA, OB, OC, and OD, which are
enumerated one to four, are described by four equivalent bosonic operators a†

j (aj), 1 ≤ j ≤ 4. The
six bending oscillators 6 AOB, 6 AOC, 6 AOD, 6 COD, 6 DOB, and 6 BOC, enumerated by ﬁve to
ten, are described by six equivalent bosonic operators a†

µ (aµ), 5 ≤ µ ≤ 10. Those ten sets of bosonic
operators satisfy the well known algebraic relations. Hereafter, the indexes j, µ, and α run from 1 to

4, 5 to 10, and 1 to 10, respectively, and nα denotes the phonon number on the αth oscillator, and ns

and nb the total phonon numbers on stretching and bending oscillators, respectively.

From the standard method of group theory, it is easy to reduce the regular representation of the point

group Td. Applying those combinations of group elements, that belong to irreducible representations

of Td, to the states |n1n2n3n4i for pure stretching vibrations and the states |n5n6n7n8n9n10i for pure

bending vibrations, respectively, we generally obtain the symmetry adapted bases for the states with

any phonon number. Then, the product of two bases can be combined into irreducible bases by the

Clebsch-Gordan coeﬃcients of Td, denoted as |ni ≡ |n1n2n3n4n5n6n7n8n9n10i.

For the fundamental bending vibrations (nb = 1) there are six states belonging to three irreducible

representation: A1, E, and F2. As is well known [19], there are only ﬁve degrees of freedom for the

bending vibrations (E ⊕ F2), because there is a constraint between the six angles. The state belonging

to the representation A1 is called the fundamental spurious state:

3

ψ(A1, 100000) = 6−1/2

|1µi,

(2.1)

10

µ=5
X

where |1µi denotes the ﬁrst excited state of the µth oscillator. This state introduces a spurious degree

of freedom that should be removed.

Some methods for removing the spurious states were recently introduced.

Iachello and Oss [9]

placed the spurious states at the energies ≥ 10 times the energies of the physical states by projection

operators. This method of removal is exact for harmonic bending vibrations and acquires a small

error for anharmonic ones. Instead, Lemus and Frank [13] directly eliminated the spurious states from

both the space and the Hamiltonian. They demanded the matrix elements of the Hamiltonian related

to the fundamental spurious state ψ(A1, 100000) vanishing. However, it is impossible to demand all

the matrix elements of the Hamiltonian that related to the spurious states vanishing. In Ref. [14] a

criterion for identifying the spurious states was introduced: a state is a spurious state if it contains

ψ(A1, 100000) as a factor. In addition, the bases of the physical states are chosen to be orthogonal

with each other and with all the spurious states. In next section we will use this criterion to remove

the spurious states from Hamiltonian and the symmetrized bases.

III. HAMILTONIAN

Studies of the vibrations in a tetrahedral molecule already exist in the literature.

Its excited

stretching vibrational states were explained in the local mode model [17] and a U(5) algebraic model

[5]. A U(2) algebraic approach [13] was proposed for both stretching and bending modes, where

the interactions between the stretch and the bend were neglected. In our previous papers [14,15] we

studied the vibrational spectrum of methane in boson-realization model in terms of bosonic operators

and q-deformed harmonic oscillators, however, intensities of infrared transitions were not involved.

We will further research both the vibrational energy levels and intensities of a tetrahedral molecules

in the two diﬀerent models, and apply it to the spectrum of SiF4.

A. HARMONICALLY COUPLED BOSON-REALIZATION MODEL

First of all, we outline the boson-realization model that we recently introduced in [14], where the

interactions between the stretch and the bend are described by a quadratic cross term. We here call

it as the harmonically coupled boson-realization model (HCBM). Then, we calculate the energy levels

of SiF4 in HCBM.

For simplicity we assume that all oscillators are the Morse ones with two parameters ω and x, so

that the energies of those oscillators can be expressed in the operator form:

Es(nj) = nj {ωs − xs(nj + 1)} ,

1 ≤ j ≤ 4,

Eb(nµ) = nµ {ωb − xb(nµ + 1)} ,

5 ≤ µ ≤ 10,

The term with λsb describes the interaction between stretching and bending vibrations, which was

neglected in Ref. [13] for simplicity. The Hamiltonian H contains seven parameters: ωs, xs, ωb, xb,

λs, λb, and λsb.

Following the criterion in Sec. II for eliminating the spurious states from the bases and straight

calculating, we ﬁnd that for n = 1 and representation A1, there is one physical state, for n = 1 and

E there is only one set of physical states, for n=1 and F2 there are two sets of physical states, for

n=2 and F2 there are seven sets of physical states, and for n=3 and F2, there are 25 sets of physical

states, and for n=4 and F2, there are 69 sets of physical states. Those combinations for n = 1, 2 were

given in Ref. [14], and others can be obtained from us upon request.

In those bases of the physical states the Hamiltonian becomes a symmetric block matrix. The

energies of physical states can be calculated provided that the parameters of the Hamiltonian are

known. A least-square ﬁtting is adopted to get the parameters from the observed data. The observed

energy levels from Ref. [20] and the corresponding calculated values are given in Table I, where the
standard deviation (SD) in this ﬁt (Fit A) is 1.956 cm−1. The seven parameters obtained are given

in Table II. In terms of those parameters one can calculate the other energy levels. Since the infrared

experimental dipole transitions energies correspond to F2, we hereby only list the calculation results

for other F2 states in Table III.

From Table II we see that the ratio |ws/xs| of the stretching modes is larger than that of the bending

ones. It means that, contrary to the case in methane [14], the anharmonicity of bending modes in

SiF4 is larger than that of the stretching ones. At least, the anharmonicity of the vibrations depends

upon the molecules discussed.

B. FERMI RESONANCE BOSON-REALIZATION MODEL

With the development and reﬁnement of experimental techniques in high-resolution spectroscopy,

measurements of high excited vibrational spectra for molecules become available [21]. One of im-

portant characters in highly excited states is appearance of anharmonic resonances. Fermi resonance

(FR), one of these resonances, is taken into account for description of molecular vibrations. In the nor-

mal mode model, FR terms were treated as perturbative corrections [22], while they were described by

the nondiagonal matrix elements of Majorana operators in U(4) algebraic model [23]. Recently, simple

Fermi resonance-local mode models for bent triatomic molecules [24] and pyramidal XY3 molecules
[25] have been constructed by Halonen et al., where FR terms are expressed in terms of curvilinear in-

ternal valence coordinates. In addition, FR can be of central importance for intramolecular vibrational

redistribution and kinetics [26]. Therefore, it is necessary for us to consider FR in the boson-realization

model. We present an extended model, called Fermi resonance boson-realization model (FRBM), and

it is pleasure to see that FRBM provides smaller standard deviation than HCBM in the energy level

ﬁts of SiF4.

We introduce another vibrational Hamiltonian for a tetrahedral molecule, where the interactions

between stretching and bending vibrations are described by the Td symmetric FR terms that couple

one creation (or, respectively, annihilation) operator of stretching vibrations with two annihilation

(or, respectively, creation) operators of bending ones. Although aµaν belongs to 3A1 ⊕ 3E ⊕ 3F2 ⊕ F1,

we ﬁnd only four independent Td invariant combinations related to physical states:

i) A1 ⊗ (E ⊗ E)A1 ,


ii) A1 ⊗ (F2 ⊗ F2)A1 ,

iii) F2 ⊗ (E ⊗ F2)F2 ,

(3.7)

where the Hamiltonian preserve the quantum number N = 2ns + nb.

The symmetrized bases are also used in the calculation. Using the same method for removing

the spurious states as described in Sec.

II, we ﬁnd that there are 1 set of states with N = 1 for

representation E (no spurious state), and 3 states with N=2 for A1 (removing 1 spurious state), and

for the representation F2 there are 1 set of states with N = 1 (no spurious state), 3 sets of states with

N = 2 (removing 1 set of spurious state), 8 sets of states with N = 3 (removing 4 sets of spurious

states), 20 sets of states with N = 4 (removing 12 sets of spurious states), 43 sets of states with N = 5

(removing 32 sets of spurious states), and 90 sets of states with N = 6 (removing 75 sets of spurious

states). The physical states and the Hamiltonian matrices in those physical states are evaluated with

the help of the computer algebra program MATHEMATICA [27].

For comparison, we also list the ten parameters determined by ﬁtting the same 16 experimental

data (Fit B) in Table II and the calculated results in Table I, respectively. The standard deviation in
this ﬁt is 0.908 cm−1. Other calculation results for the spectrum only for F2 are given in Table IV.

From Table II we see that the parameters λf 2, λf 3 and λf 4 are quite small.

It provides us a

possibility to set those three parameters vanishing. In this way another ﬁtting (Fit C) is obtained
with the standard deviation 0.989 cm−1, where it contains the same number of parameters as in Fit A.

This standard deviation is about one half of that in Fit A. The seven parameters and the calculated

values obtained in Fit C are given in the corresponding tables.

It is interesting to compare the obtained parameters in the three ﬁts. From Table II, when FR

terms (Fit B) is replaced with the harmonical coupling (Fit A) between the stretch and the bend,

the biggest change of the parameters is that of the anharmonic constant xs in Morse oscillator of the

stretch, while parameter λb for the interactions between the bending vibrations gets the least change.

Table IV

7

When the three small FR parameters are set to be zero (Fit C), other parameters change very little

in comparison with those in Fit B. Fit C provides less standard deviation than Fit A with the same

number of parameters. To our knowledge, it may be the model with the least parameters that well

ﬁts the observed vibrational spectrum of SiF4. In principle, the physical meaning of those obtained

parameters can be explained in terms of internal coordinate.

It is worth mentioning that McDowell et al. [20] described the same vibrational spectrum of SiF4

by the normal mode model with more parameters. This model provides the normal mode labels for

small amplitude polyatomic molecular vibrational spectra. However, it becomes less appropriate at

higher levels of vibrational excitation. In particular, the assignment of sets of normal mode quantum

numbers to give spectral absorption features becomes inherently ambiguous [28]. This model does not

provide explicitly wave functions so that some physical properties such as transition intensities are

hard to be calculated.

IV. INTENSITIES OF INFRARED TRANSITION

Having completed calculations for the vibrational energy levels of SiF4, we are now able to compute

the intensities of infrared transition for all active modes. This information can be used to check the

assignments and in the study of intramolecular energy relaxation in SiF4. For stretching vibrations
of tetrahedral molecules, Leroy et al.

[29] recently constructed an electric dipole moment operator

through unitary algebra and point group symmetry. However, their dipole function is not feasible for

treating other vibrational modes. Intensities of infrared and Raman transition of stretching modes
in octahedral molecules were analyzed by Chen et al. [30] in terms of U(2) algebra. In this section,

intensities of infrared transition for all active modes of SiF4 will be computed in the two approaches

presented in Sec. III.

The absolute absorption intensities from state n′ to n in the infrared active mode F2 are given by

Inn′ = νnn′ Pnn′ ,

Pnn′ = |hn| ˆTx|n′i|2 + |hn| ˆTy|n′i|2 + |hn| ˆTz|n′i|2,

(4.1)

where νnn′ is the frequency of the observed transition, and ˆTx, ˆTy, and ˆTz correspond to the three com-
ponents of the infrared transition operator ˆT . All other constants are absorbed in the normalization
of the operator ˆT . The three components of ˆT are

ˆTx = γs (ˆt1 − ˆt2 + ˆt3 − ˆt4) + γb (ˆt6 − ˆt9) + γsb (ˆt1 + ˆt2 + ˆt3 + ˆt4)(ˆt6 − ˆt9),

ˆTy = γs (ˆt1 − ˆt2 − ˆt3 + ˆt4) + γb (ˆt7 − ˆt10) + γsb (ˆt1 + ˆt2 + ˆt3 + ˆt4)(ˆt7 − ˆt10),

ˆTz = γs (ˆt1 + ˆt2 − ˆt3 − ˆt4) + γb (ˆt5 − ˆt8) + γsb (ˆt1 + ˆt2 + ˆt3 + ˆt4)(ˆt5 − ˆt8),

(4.2)

where γs, γb, and γsb are parameters, and ˆtα is the local operator on the αth bond. The term with
γsb is the higher order contribution of ˆT , which is necessary for describing both the stretching and

8

the bending active modes in SiF4. Following [9] we take the matrix elements of ˆtα as follows:

hn|ˆtj|n′i = exp(−ηj|nj − n′

j|),

1 ≤ j ≤ 4,

hn|ˆtµ|n′i = exp(−ηµ|nµ − n′

µ|),

5 ≤ µ ≤ 10,

(4.3)

where the coeﬃcients ηj should be equal for the equivalent bonds ηj≡ηs, and ηµ≡ηb.

Since calculations are done in the symmetrized bases it is suﬃcient to consider only the z component,
ˆTz. All others can be obtained by making use of the Wigner-Eckart theorem. The relative intensities
calculated in Fit A and Fit B are given in Table I, where they are compared with experiment. The

corresponding parameters and the standard deviations (SD) are listed in Table V. In the two ﬁts, the

obtained parameters in the operator of infrared transition have a little diﬀerence, but the calculated

intensities for a few energy levels are quite diﬀerent. This is owing to the diﬀerent wave functions and

the same transition operator in the two models.

Table V

In Table I most of calculated intensities for the two models are in good agreement with the ex-

perimental values, but a few are not. Those diﬀerences may come from two sources. The observed

intensities are only approximately accurate [20], and the other higher order contributions to the op-
erator ˆT are neglected. The more accurate experimental data are needed to improve the models.

In order to complete the spectroscopic study of vibrational overtone of SiF4, we should also calculate

the intensities of Raman transition in the two models. Unfortunately, We have to postpone this

calculation due to lack of the observed values.

V. CONCLUSION

For studying the stretching and bending spectrum of a tetrahedral molecule, we have presented

a harmonically coupled boson-realization model (HCBM) and a Fermi resonance boson-realization

model (FRBM), where the coupling between the stretch and the bend is described by a quadratic cross

term and by Fermi resonance terms, respectively. The two models have been applied to the complete

vibrations of silicon tetraﬂuoride SiF4. HCBM with seven parameters and FRBM with ten parameters
provide ﬁts to the published experimental vibrational eigenvalues with standard deviations 1.956 cm−1
and 0.908 cm−1, respectively. This is based on our new method for constructing symmetrized bases

[14] and for removing both the spurious states in the wavefunction space and the spurious components

in Hamiltonian [15]. This method is particularly useful for highly excited states in large molecules. In
another FRBM, we decrease the number of parameters and obtain the standard deviation 0.989 cm−1

that is about half of that in HCBM with the same number of parameters. To our knowledge, FRBM

may be the model for a good description of vibrational spectrum of SiF4 with the least parameters.

We believe that FRBM will be better suitable for describing highly excited vibrations in molecules.

The intensities of infrared transitions of the complete vibrations in this molecule have been calcu-

lated in those two models. The model transition operator with ﬁve parameters well reproduces the

9

observed data. The more satisfactory results can be obtained if more accurate experimental values

are available.

Finally, we remark that our models can be extended in several ways. The Fermi resonances may

be taken into account as perturbative terms in HCBM, or the harmonically coupled term appears

in FRBM as a perturbative one. Other anharmonic resonances such as Darling-Dennison resonances

can be included in the models by adding higher-order terms of bosonic operators [16]. The rotational

degrees of freedom can be incorporated by coupling the vibrational wave functions to rotational states

carrying the appropriate point symmetries [31]. Our algebraic Hamiltonian can be written down in

the coset space representation to study the dynamics of stationary eigenstates and inter-mode energy

transfer [32]. Work on those subjects is in progress.

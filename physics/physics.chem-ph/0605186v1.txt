We develop a model of molecular binding based on the Bohr-Sommerfeld description of atoms
together with a constraint taken from conventional quantum mechanics. The model can describe
the binding energy curves of H2, H3 and other molecules with striking accuracy. Our approach
treats electrons as point particles with positions determined by extrema of an algebraic energy
function. Our constrained model provides a physically appealing, accurate description of multi-
electron chemical bonds.

Quantum chemistry has achieved excellent agreement
between theory and experiment by use of computa-
tional power to provide an adequate description electron-
electron interactions [1]. The conventional treatment
of molecular structure are based on solving the many-
particle Schr¨odinger equation with varying degree of so-
phistication, ranging from Diﬀusion Monte Carlo meth-
ods, coupled cluster expansion, conﬁguration interac-
tions, to density functional theory. All are intensely nu-
merical, limited to rather small systems and at the ex-
pense of providing a simple physical picture of the chemi-
cal bond. Despite the successes of modern computational
chemistry, there remains a need for understanding elec-
tron correlations in some relatively simple way so that we
may describe ground and excited states of large systems
with reasonable accuracy.

Our goal here is to advance an intuitively appealing
model of molecular bonding capable of producing binding
energy curves at chemical accuracy of a few milli-Hartree.
Our approach is based on the recently resurrected Bohr’s
1913 model for molecules [2], which is derivable from an
inﬁnite dimensional reduction of the Schr¨odinger equa-
tion [3]. The resulting electron conﬁgurations are remi-
niscent of the Lewis electron-dot structure introduced in
1916 [4]. The surprising feature of our work is that all
molecular binding energy curves studied below can be ac-
counted for by mostly electrostatic interaction of “well-
placed” electrons, as if all the complicated kinetic and
overlapping integrals have been approximated by their
mean-values via well-chosen electron positions. Such an
approach can potentially describe the structural elements
of large molecules beyond the current capability of ab ini-
tial methods.

We will ﬁrst derive our model for H2, followed by ap-
plications to more complex molecules. Fig. 1 displays
various electron distances in H2. Distances and ener-
/me2) and
gies are in units of the Bohr radius a0 (= ¯h
Hartree (= e2/a0) respectively. The original molecular
Bohr model [2] quantize the electron’s angular momen-
tum about the molecular axis resulting in the ground
state energy function [5, 6],

R is the internuclear separation. In our model, electron
conﬁgurations of a physical state correspond to extrema
of an energy function, such as Eq. (1) [3, 6].

In Fig. 2 (curve 1) we plot the ground state E(R) of
Eq. (1), together with “exact” quantum mechanical re-
sults [7] (solid circles). The original Bohr model yields
a fairly accurate H2 ground state energy E(R) at small
R, but becomes increasely inaccurate at larger internu-
clear separations. This can be remedied by the following
observation. At large R each electron in H2 feels only
the nearest nuclear charge, resulting in two weakly in-
teracting neutral H atoms. Therefore, at large R each
electron’s angular momentum ought to be quantized rel-
ative to the nearest nucleus, rather than to the molecular
axis. This asymptotic consideration yields the following

For R > 2.77 this energy function has a local minimum
for the top conﬁguration of Fig. 3. We plot the corre-
sponding E(R) in Fig. 2 (curve 2). However, at R < 2.77
the local minimum of the energy function (3) disappears

and each electron can collapse onto the other nucleus,
i.e., rb1 and/or ra2 can vanish. As one can see from Fig.
2, the energy function (3), which is a natural generaliza-
tion of Bohr’s hydrogen atom to the molecular case, is
in good quantitative agreement with the “exact” energy
over the range of R > 2.77 where the local minimum ex-
ists. This encourages us to seek a way of extending the
applicability of Eq. (3) to the entire range of R.

In the above naive generalization of Bohr’s atom to the
molecular case, each electron can collapse onto the other
nucleus because there is no corresponding Bohr kinetic
energy term about that nucleus to prevent the collapse.
By incorporating further insights from quantum mechan-
ics, we can remove this instability by a simple constraint.
Quantum mechanically, the two electrons are described
by a wave function Ψ(r1, r2). Electron 1 is a charge cloud
with a most probable radius r. Let

be the quantum mechanical potential between the elec-
tron cloud centered at nucleus A and the nuclear charge
of B, or vice versa.
In the Bohr picture we treat the
electron as a point particle on a sphere of radius r cen-
tered about nucleus A. A subset of the spherical surface,
a “circle” of positions r satisfying

(5)

will give the correct quantum mechanical interaction en-
ergy with nucleus B. Thus if we impose the above as a
constraint, and choose the electron location only from

2

this subset of the positions, then rb1 can never be zero,
because the expectation value in Eq. (4) is ﬁnite.

One can derive the eﬀective potential Φ(r, R) from any
simple two-electron wave functions, such as the Heitler-
London (HL) [8] or the Hund-Mulliken (HM) [9] wave
function Ψ. The HL wave function is

Ψ = a(1)b(2) ± b(1)a(2),

for i = 1 − 2 are variational wave functions with param-

an isolated hydrogen atom, then the variational energy
is E = α2/2 − α. This reduces to the Bohr model energy
function for the hydrogen atom if we identify α = 1/r,
where r is the radial distance from the nucleus. We will
also use r to denote the radial distance of an electron
from its nearest nucleus.

For the HL wave function Eq. (4) yields the well known

For the triplet state, the HL and HM wave functions are
the same, yielding identical triplet potentials. Note that
by introducing singlet and triplet potentials, we have aug-
mented the original atomic Bohr model with elements of
Pauli’s exclusion principle. The latter is essential for any
successful description of atomic and molecular systems.

FIG. 3: Electron conﬁguration for the ground (singlet) and
triplet states of H2 molecule.

The energy function has an extremum when ra1 = rb2 =
r and ra2 = rb1. The resulting electron conﬁgurations
corresponding to the ground and triplet states are as
shown in Fig. 3, where, for singlet ground state

and for the triplet excited state,

r12 =

.

These are just geometric distances between the two elec-
trons expressed in terms of R, r and rb1. The angle θ is
determined by the relation 1/Φ2 = R2 + r2 − 2rR cos θ.
The binding energy curves E(R) for both singlet and
triplet states are shown in Fig. 4. There are no ﬁt-
ting parameters in our calculations. The solid and dot-
ted lines are results from using the HM and HL poten-
tial respectively. Solid circles are “exact” results [7].
The constrained Bohr model gives a surprisingly accurate
E(R) at all R, yielding a ground state binding energy of
EB = 4.50 eV for the HL potential and EB = 4.99 eV for
the HM potential [10]. The “exact” result is EB = 4.745
eV [1]. The Heitler-London-Wang eﬀective charge calcu-
lation (dashed curves) gives substantially worse accuracy
with EB = 3.78 eV [8, 11]. Only more elaborate varia-
tional calculations with conﬁguration interaction can pro-
duce energies comparable to our constrained Bohr model
results.

Generalizing the constraint Eq.

(5) to a system of
several hydrogen atoms is straightforward. Let’s consider
electron 1 belonging to its nearest nucleus 1 and denote
the distances from electron 1 to nuclei i as ri (i = 1, 2,
. . . ). Then the constraint equation reads

while the small dot line is derived with HL potential. Dashed
curves are from HL eﬀective charge variational treatment.

(belonging to nucleus i) determines a singlet or triplet Φi
in Eq. (13). In this way, we have incorporated elements
of Pauli’s exclusion principle into our model.

When applying our model

to the triatomic H3
molecule, we consider linear and triangular conﬁgura-
tions as shown in the insert of Figs. 5 and 6. The spacing
between the nearest nuclei is assumed to be the same,
equal to R. Due to symmetry, the central electron in the
linear H3 molecule must be at equal distances from the
two neighboring nuclei. For this electron, since its posi-
tion is ﬁxed, there is no collapse and therefore no need
for any constraint. We only need to constrain the two
outermost electrons (see insert of Fig. 5) via Eq. (13) in
the form

r3

= Φs(r1, R) + Φt(r1, 2R),

(14)

where ri are deﬁned in the insert of Fig. 5. For the linear
H3 ground state, adjacent electrons in the molecule have
opposite spins, requiring the singlet potential Φs(r1, R).
(We use the HM singlet potential given by Eq. (11)). In
this case, the spins of the two outermost electrons must
be parallel requiring the triplet potential Φt(r1, 2R).

we take the HM eﬀective potential given by Eq. (11).
As in the case of the linear H3 molecule, the constrained
Bohr model yielded very accurate E(R) over the entire
range of internuclear separation. The constrained Bohr
model also gives good results for other molecules, e.g.,
Be2 as shown in Fig. 7 and H4.

In the vicinity of the energy minimum the constrained
Bohr model for Be2 provides accuracy of a few milli
Hartree with no ﬁtting parameters. However, since Be2
is very weakly bound the binding energy is oﬀ by about
50%. Nevetheless, the bond length remains quite accu-
rate.

picture of how multi-electron bonds are formed and holds

ods. The model can also be applied to the calculation of

potential curves of molecules in a super strong magnetic
ﬁeld on surfaces of white dwarf and neutron stars.

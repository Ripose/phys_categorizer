It is demonstrated that the reaction path for a polyatomic molecule (applied to the HCO molecule)
is easily calculated via geometry-independent tight binding Hamiltonian ﬁtted to accurate ab-initio
conﬁguration interaction (CI) total energies. This Hamiltonian not only reproduces the CI calcula-
tions accurately and eﬃciently, but also eﬀectively corrects any CI energies happening to erroneously
converge to excited states.

The question. The determination of the reaction path
in a chemical reaction needs the detailed knowledge of
the pertinent potential energy surface (PES) (diabatic
or adiabatic). This is a formidable task because (i) the
PES is a multi-dimensional surface, impossible to be ab-
initio calculated at every point in the degrees of free-
dom (DOF) space, and interpolation is necessary (the
most accurate known detailed multi-dimensional PES is
that of H3 interpolated from 71969 ab-initio DOF points
[1]). (ii) Because the standard ab-initio calculations of
the many electron problem in the Born-Oppenheimer ap-
proximation, based on the variational principle, (accu-
rate ab-initio conﬁguration interaction (CI) calculations)
yield only adiabatic curves, and, more importantly, be-
ing iterative, sometimes converge to undesirable states
([2], also c.f. below). Yet, such calculations may be in-
hibitively time consuming. For the ground state, the time
problem is already traditionally overcome via the density
functional theory (DFT) [3], which self-consistently ap-
proximates the many electron by a one-electron problem.
However, DFT calculations sometimes fail to explain ex-
perimentally observed features of the PES [4]. Thus, the
accurate CI calculations are more or less indispensable,
even if performed in a rather limited, but representa-
tive, set of molecular geometries. Therefore, a reliable
interpolation scheme for the pertinent PES, based on CI
calculations, and overcoming the problem of wrong CI
convergence, is desirable.

The purpose.

It is shown that such an interpo-
lation scheme is possible, based on a spin-polarized
[5] geometry-independent
(SK)
parametrization [7] of ab-initio CI total energies [8]. As
a demonstration, the method is applied to a triatomic
molecule of chemical kinetics interest, HCO, which is an
intermediate radical in the generation of a primary ion

[6] Slater

- Koster

during hydrocarbon combustion:

O(3P ) + CH(X 2Π and/or a4Σ−) → [HCO]∗(2A′)
→ HCO+ + e−

The reaction of O(3P) with CH(X2Π, a4Σ−) is known
experimentally [9] to generate the HCO+ cation via au-
toionization of some state (or states) of the intermedi-
ate HCO radical upon interaction with some vibrational
level of the ion. The ﬁrst step toward computations of
such interactions is the construction of the potential en-
ergy surface (PES) of the states with low (or no) barrier,
through which a reaction at the experimental tempera-
ture can proceed. Such a state (without a barrier) is the
HCO(X2A’) state [10], used here to test the interpolation
scheme on a molecular system. The reaction path of the
formation of HCO (in 2A′ symmetry) is also computed
using the interpolated PES.

The procedure. First several (724 - compared to 71969
of H3 [1]) accurate CI total energies, based on (less
accurate) multi-conﬁguration self-consistent ﬁeld (MC-
SCF) orbitals, are calculated at selected geometries of
the H,C,O atoms in the A′ symmetry of the Cs group.
Most of them (508) are ﬁtted to the interpolation scheme,
the remaining serving to check the quality of the ﬁt.
For the ﬁt a non-orthogonal spin-polarized tight bind-
ing (TB) Hamiltonian is formed, whose matrix elements,
along with those of the overlap matrix, are expressed
as functions of the bond direction, according to the SK
scheme [7], and of the bond length, according to the
i.e.:
Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) technique [6],
The functions are generally polynomials of the inter-
atomic distance, within exponential envelopes, the co-
eﬃcients and the exponents being varied as parameters.
For two adiabatic states near some (avoided) crossing the
TB Hamiltonian naturally produces two diabatic PESs
in nearby extrapolation, and predicts to which diabatic
PES, ground-state or excited, nearby CI energies belong.
Among these, the appropriate ones can be used to ex-

tend the ﬁt beyond the (avoided) crossings, around which
two sets of parameters are needed for the two PES’s. If
it happens, as with HCO, that the ground and excited
state energies beyond the crossing lie close to each other,
the adiabatic PES can be ﬁtted as well, with comparable
accuracy.

Finally, by using at each point of the DOF space the
lowest lying TB-ﬁtted PES, the adiabatic path can be
found: For each value of a desired degree of freedom (in
our case for each C-O distance) the energy minimum is
searched [11] in the space of the remaining degrees of
freedom (C-H distance and H-C-O angle). Having the
parametrized tight binding Hamiltonian, any property
can be trivially computed.

Methodology. For the CI energies the correlation con-
sistent aug-cc-pVTZ basis set was used [12, 13] in con-
junction with the complete active space self-consistent
ﬁeld (CASSCF) + 1 + 2 multi-reference CI method
(MRCI) employed in the MOLPRO package [8] (the four
electrons in the 1s orbitals of C and O were unexcited).
The CASSCF calculations were state-averaged, and the
active space was limited to the 9 valence orbitals among
which the remaining 11 electrons were distributed.
In
the subsequent MRCI calculations the uncontracted con-
ﬁgurations were around 50 million internally contracted
to about one million. Calculations between C-O dis-
tances of 1.7 and 6 bohr were done for several H-C-
O angles between 50o and 180o and several C-H dis-
tances between 1.7 and 4.5 bohr, most around the C-
H equilibrium distance of 2.12 bohr. The three lowest
roots of the secular equation were computed to increase
the accuracy of the calculation. By an analytic gradi-
ent optimization at the MCSCF level, an approximate
(MCSCF) equilibrium geometry was found at the DOF
space point (˜rHC , ˜rCO, ˜θH−C−O) = (2.12, 2.2, 126o) (in
a.u.). Because it is not evident whether the aforemen-
tioned points are beyond any avoided crossing, where
the role of the ground and the excited states would be
interchanged, ﬁrst several DOF points near equilibrium
were obtained by employing a generalization of the 3-
dimensional sphere to the generally multi-dimensional (in
this case also 3-dimensional) DOF space: xi = ri/˜ri −1, i
= {HC, CO}, x3 = θ/˜θ − 1, where generally for n degrees
of freedom, points belonging to a n-dimensional hyper-
sphere of radius r and center (˜xi, i = 1,...,n) are obtained
by

xn − ˜xn = r cosθn

xn−1 − ˜xn−1 = r sinθn cosθn−1

(1)

...

x1 − ˜x1 = r sinθn sinθn−1...cosθ1

where the 1st θ1 = 0 or 180o, the two points of a “1-
dimensional sphere”, and the other 0 < θi < 180o are the
“azimuthal” hypersphere angles (incidentally, a variable
dimensional do-loop code was invented, needed to treat
any larger molecule). Thus, ﬁrst points with small r were
ﬁtted, and gradually the ﬁt was extended to more remote

2

DOF points.

The formalism of the NRL geometry - independent TB
parametrization is described in detail in Ref. [6]; here an
essential summary is only presented. The total energy is
written as

E[n(~r)] = X

f (

) ǫi s + F [n(~r)]

µ − ǫi s
T

µ′ − ´ǫi s
T

i ; s=1,2

≡ X

f (

i ; s=1,2

) ´ǫi s

(2)

where [14] f (x) = 1/(1 + ex), T=0.005 mRy, and

´ǫi s = ǫi s + V0 ; µ′ = µ + V0 ; V0 = F [n(~r)]/Ne (3)

with Ne = Pi ; s=1,2 f ((µ − ǫi s)/T ) being the number
of electrons, i counts the states, s = 1, 2 counts the spin.
Since the total energy is independent of the choice of
zero of the potential, the shift V0 is suﬃcient to be deter-
mined by the requirement that ´ǫi s are the eigenvalues of
the generalized eigenvalue problem (H − S ´ǫi s) ψi s = 0,
where H is the TB Hamiltonian and S is overlap matrix
in an atomic s- and p-orbital basis representation {φa}.
Thus, a non-orthogonal TB calculation uses on-site, hop-
ping and overlap parameters. Demanding that only the
on-site SK parameters are aﬀected by the shift V0, for
atom I in a spin-polarized structure the matrix elements
are expressed as

is a generalized pair potential (“density”), with R0 = 15
bohr, rc = 0.5 bohr, RI J is the internuclear distance be-
tween atoms I and J, ˜I( ˜J) denote the type of atom on
the site I(J) while λ ˜I ˜J s, depending on the atom type,
and bI
l n s are the on-site NRL geometry-independent pa-
rameters (GIP). It is found suﬃcient to keep hopping and
overlap parameters spin independent, of the form

Pγ(R) = (

where γ indicates the type of interaction (i.e. ssσ, spσ,
ppσ, ppπ and psσ). The NRL GIPs are cγ n and gγ , R
is the interatomic distance, and R0 and rc are as in eq.
5.

Within the context of the NRL code [6], written pri-
marily for solids, the molecule was treated as a base to a
large cubic lattice unit cell (lattice constant = 100 a.u.)
ensuring vanishing interaction between atoms in neigh-
boring cells. Thus, the PES was described in terms of

3

the following NRL GIPs for each spin polarization. On-
site: s: H, C, O, (H depending on C), (C on H), (H on
O), (O on H), (C on O), and (O on C); p: C, O, (C on
H), (O on H), (C on O), and (O on C). Hopping and
overlap parameters: ssσ: H-C, H-O, C-O; spσ: H-C, H-
O, C-O and O-C (denoted as psσ); ppσ and ppπ: C-O.
For HCO, since similar atoms are well separated, the H-
H, C-C and O-O parameters vanish. We ﬁtted 508 CI
points and checked the resulting PES against 216 more
CI energies not included in the ﬁt. The error was less
than 10−3 a.u., which is within the ab-initio PES accu-
racy (starting from diﬀerent initial guesses the MCSCF
calculation may converge to slightly diﬀerent results by
10−3 a.u.). To ensure obtaining physically meaningful
TB parameters, for a very limited number of molecular
geometries the Hamiltonian eigenvalues were also ﬁtted,
while the total energy was ﬁtted for all 508 structures.

Finally, for the reaction path we used a non-linear en-
ergy minimization technique employing Powell’s conju-
gate directions method [15] modiﬁed to be restricted to
closed intervals of the DOF space [11].

For comparison, each of the 724 ab-initio CI calcu-
lations needs 3 hours of CPU time, each n-dimensional
hypersphere radius r-increase, to ﬁt more remote points
(with 10 such hypersphere radial extensions all points
can be covered) needs 2-3 hours, and each 2-dimensional
energy minimization, using the ﬁnal TB parameters (i.e.
the reaction path determination), needs a few seconds.

rectly total energy curves for points not included in the
ﬁt as shown for example in Fig. 1. Since it produces
naturally the diabatically extended branch of the en-
ergy, it could distinguish to which adiabatic state near an
avoided crossing the CI values belong. Classifying such
CI points may sometimes be misleading or unrecogniz-
able by mere observation of the MCSCF orbitals. An ex-
ample is shown in Fig. 2. However, the most impressive
aspect was that we realized, through the ﬁt, that at some
points (about 10 in 700) the CI calculation had converged
to excited energies (which ought to be disregarded, oth-
erwise they would destroy the ﬁt). An example is given
in Fig. 3. Finally, Fig. 4 shows the reaction path for the
formation of HCO, as HC approaches O. For a triatomic
molecule the ﬁgure contains the whole information: For
each C-O distance the minimum energy and the corre-
sponding C-H distance and H-C-O angle are displayed.
At large C-O distances, O is more attracted toward H,
but, in approaching equilibrium, O binds mainly with C,
the H-C-O angle gradually becoming ≃ 122o (represent-
ing the CI value). Around equilibrium (c.f. Table I),
the angle changes slightly monotonically by 1-2o, but be-
cause, in increasing the C-O distance, the C-H distance
decreases, predominantly an antisymmetric stretching vi-
bration occurs. To our knowledge there is no experimen-
tal conﬁrmation of the reaction path of this intermediate
molecule.

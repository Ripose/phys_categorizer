Electron correlation is included for the ﬁrst time in an ab
initio calculation of the interaction of the permanent P, T -odd
proton electric dipole moment with the internal electromag-
netic ﬁeld in a molecule. The calculation is performed for
the ground state of 205TlF at the experimental equilibrium,
Re=2.0844 ˚A, and at R=2.1 ˚A, using the generalized relativis-
tic eﬀective core potential (GRECP) method, with spin-orbit
and correlation eﬀects included by relativistic coupled cluster
(RCC). Calculated results with single cluster amplitudes only
are in excellent agreement (1% or better) with recent Dirac-
Hartree-Fock (DHF) values of the magnetic parameter M ; the
larger diﬀerences occurring between present and DHF volume
parameter (X) values, as well as between the two DHF cal-
culations, are explained. Inclusion of electron correlation by
GRECP/RCC with single and double excitations has a major
eﬀect on the P, T -odd parameters, decreasing M by 12% and
X by 24%.

Introduction. The measurement of permanent electric
dipole moments (EDM) of elementary particles is highly
important for the theory of P, T -odd interactions. Exper-
iments performed so far have given only upper bounds for
the EDMs. The extraction of EDMs from measurements
on molecules containing heavy atoms requires knowledge
of nuclear and electronic properties of the molecule. High
quality calculations of the relevant electronic properties
are therefore essential for accurate determination of the
EDMs.

Here we consider the interaction of the proton EDM
with the internal electromagnetic ﬁeld of the 205TlF
molecule. This molecule is one of the best candidates
for proton EDM measurements [1]. Following Hinds and
Sandars [2], the eﬀective interaction with the proton
EDM in TlF is written in the form

Heﬀ = (dV + dM )~σN ·

~λ ,

(1)

where ~σN is the Tl nuclear spin operator, ~λ is the unit
vector along the internuclear axis z from Tl to F, dV and

dM are constants corresponding to the volume and mag-
netic eﬀects according to Schiﬀ’s theory [3]. Hinds and
Sandars showed [2] that the volume eﬀect in a coordinate
system centered on the Tl nucleus is given by

The parameters X of Eq. (3) and M of Eq. (5) are
determined by the electronic structure of the molecule.
They were calculated recently for the X0+ ground state
of TlF by Parpia [4] and by Quiney et al. [5] using the
Dirac-Hartree-Fock (DHF) method with large Gaussian
basis sets (see Table I). No calculation which includes
correlation eﬀects is available. The main goal of the
present work is to calculate the X and M parameters
for the molecule with correlation included to high order.
Methods. The generalized relativistic eﬀective core
potential (GRECP) method [6] is applied to the TlF
molecule. A two-component electronic (pseudo)wave
function is ﬁrst obtained with the 21-electron GRECP
[7,8] for Tl, providing proper electronic density in the
valence and outer core regions, followed by restoration
of the proper shape of the four-component molecular
spinors in the inner core region of Tl. Details of the
method may be found elsewhere [6,9].

The correlation spin-orbital basis set used consisted of
26s, 25p, 18d, 12f , and 10g Gaussian-type orbitals on Tl,

1

contracted to 6s6p4d2f 1g. The basis was optimized in
a series of atomic two-component GRECP calculations,
with correlation included by the all-order relativistic cou-
pled cluster (RCC) method with single and double exci-
tations; the average energy of the two lowest states of the
atom was minimized. The basis set generation procedure
is described in Refs. [10,11]. The basis set was designed
to describe correlation in the outer core 5s and 5p shells
of Tl, in addition to the 5d and valence shells. While 5s
and 5p correlation may not be important for many of the
chemical and physical properties of the atom, it is essen-
tial for describing properties coming from inner regions,
including P, T -odd eﬀects. The (14s9p4d3f )/[4s3p2d1f ]
basis set from the ANO-L library [12] is used for ﬂuorine.
A one-component self-consistent-ﬁeld (SCF) calcula-
tion of the (1σ . . . 7σ)14(1π2π3π)12(1δ)4 ground state
of TlF is performed ﬁrst, using the GRECP for Tl
which simulates the interactions of the valence and
outer core (5s5p5d) electrons with the inner core
[Kr]4d4
This is followed by two-
component RCC calculations, with only single (RCC-
S) or with single and double (RCC-SD) cluster ampli-
tudes. The RCC-S calculations with the spin-dependent
GRECP operator take into account eﬀects of spin-orbit
interaction at the level of the one-conﬁgurational SCF-
type method. The RCC-SD calculations include, in ad-
dition, the most important electron correlation eﬀects.

The electron density obtained from the two-component
GRECP/RCC (pseudo)wave function in the valence and
outer core regions is very close to that of the correspond-
ing all-electron four-component function. The pseu-
dospinors are smoothed in the inner core region [6], so
that the electronic density in this region is not correct.
The operators in equations (3) and (5) are heavily con-
centrated near the nucleus, and are therefore strongly
aﬀected by the wave function in the inner region. The
four-component molecular spinors must therefore be re-
stored in the inner region of Tl. All molecular spinors φi
are restored as one-center expansions on the Tl nucleus,
using the nonvariational restoration scheme (see [6,9] and
references therein).

The restoration is started by generating equivalent ba-
sis sets of atomic (one-center) four-component spinors

fnlj(r)χljm
gnlj(r)χl′jm (cid:19)(cid:27)

and two-component pseudospinors

(cid:26)(cid:18)
˜fnlj(r)χljm}
by atomic ﬁnite-diﬀerence all-electron
{
DHF and two-component GRECP/SCF calculations of
the same valence conﬁgurations of Tl and its ions. Here
n is the principal quantum number, j and m are the total
electronic momentum and its projection on the internu-
clear axis, l and l′ are the orbital momenta, and l′=2j
l.
The nucleus is modeled as a uniform charge distribu-
tion within a sphere, whereas previous calculations em-
ployed a spherical Gaussian nuclear charge distribution
[4,5]. The all-electron four-component HFD [13] and two-

−

component GRECP/HFJ [7,8] codes were employed to
generate the two equivalent [15s12p12d8f ] numerical ba-
sis sets for restoration. These sets, describing mainly the
core region, are generated independently of the basis set
for the molecular GRECP calculations discussed earlier.
The molecular pseudospinorbitals are then expanded in
the basis set of one-center two-component atomic pseu-
dospinors,

˜φi(r)

≈

Lmax

j=|l+1/2|

Xl=0

n,m
Xj=|l−1/2| X

ci
nljm

˜fnlj(r)χljm .

(6)

Note that for linear molecules only one value of m sur-
vives in the sum for every φi. Finally, the two-component
pseudospinors in the basis are replaced by the equivalent
four-component spinors and the expansion coeﬃcients
from Eq. (6) are preserved [9]:

φi(r)

≈

Lmax

j=|l+1/2|

Xj=|l−1/2| X

ci
nljm

fnlj(r)χljm
gnlj(r)χl′jm (cid:19)

(cid:18)

.

(7)

The molecular four-component spinors constructed this
way are orthogonal to the inner core spinors of Tl, as the
atomic basis functions used in Eq. (7) are generated with
the inner core electrons treated as frozen.

The quality of the approximation for the two-center
molecular spinors and, consequently, of the calculated
properties increases with the value of Lmax. A series of
calculations of the M parameter was performed using Eq.
(7) with basis functions going up to p, d and f harmonics.
We found (see Table I) that including only s and p func-
tions in the expansion determines M with 90% accuracy.
Because the contribution of f is only about 0.3% and
amplitudes of higher harmonics on the nucleus are sup-
r(j−1/2), the error due to
pressed by the leading term
the neglect of spherical harmonics beyond f is estimated
to be below 0.1%. Calculation of the X parameter re-
quires only s and p harmonics (see Ref. [5]).

∼

The restoration procedure implemented here gives a
very good description of the wave function in the core
region, which is important for accurate evaluation of the
X and M parameters. This is done at a fraction of the
cost necessary for all-electron four-component molecu-
lar calculations with Gaussian basis sets, where a large
number of additional basis functions must be included
for proper description of the inner core region and small
components of spinors [5]. Here we calculate (restore)
the four-component electronic wave function in the core
region from the (pseudo)wave function obtained in the
molecular GRECP calculation, which may be considered
“frozen” in the valence region at the restoration stage.
Basis functions describing a large number of chemically
inert core electrons may thus be excluded from the molec-
ular GRECP calculation.

The X and M parameters were calculated by the ﬁ-
nite ﬁeld method (see, e.g., Refs. [14,15]). The operator

2

corresponding to a desired property [see Eqs. (3) and (5)]
is multiplied by a small parameter λ and added to the
Hamiltonian. The derivative of the energy with respect
to λ gives the computed property. This is strictly correct
only at the limit of vanishing λ, but it is usually possible
to ﬁnd a range of λ values where the energy is linear with
λ and energy changes are large enough to allow suﬃcient
precision. The quadratic dependence on λ is eliminated
in the present calculations by averaging absolute energy
changes obtained with λ of opposite signs.

Results and discussion. Calculations were carried out
at two internuclear separations, the equilibrium Re =
2.0844 ˚A as in Ref. [4], and 2.1 ˚A, for comparison with
Ref. [5]. The results are collected in Table I. The ﬁrst
point to notice is the diﬀerence between spin-averaged
SCF and RCC-S values, which include spin-orbit inter-
action eﬀects. These eﬀects increase X by 11% and de-
crease M by 22%. The RCC-S function may be writ-
ten as a single determinant, and results may therefore
be compared with DHF values, even though the RCC-
S function is not variational. GRECP/RCC-S values of
the M parameter are indeed within 1% of corresponding
DHF values [4,5] (Table I). This agreement conﬁrms the
validity of the approximations made by us. In particu-
lar, freezing the inner core shells is justiﬁed, as inner core
relaxation eﬀects have little inﬂuence on the properties
calculated here, a conclusion already drawn by Quiney
et al. [5].

Much larger diﬀerences occur for the X parameter.
Here there are also large diﬀerences between the two DHF
calculations, which cannot be explained by the small
change in internuclear separation. The value of X may
be expected to be less stable than M , because it is deter-
mined by the derivative of the electronic density at the Tl
nucleus and involves large cancellations [5] between con-
tributions of large and small components, each of which
is about 20 times larger than their sum. Thus, a strong
dependence of X on the basis used may be expected.
The DHF values collected in Table I indeed show such
dependence. Results obtained in Refs. [4] and [5] with
comparable even-tempered basis sets, (28s28p12d8f ) and
(28s28p14d8f ), are rather close, diﬀering by 340 a.u. Im-
proving the Tl basis to (34s34p16d9f ) [5] increases X by
650 a.u. or 8%. Further improvement of the basis may
be expected to yield even higher X values; since we use
numerical basis functions for the restoration, our RCC-S
value for X, which is higher than that of Quiney et al.
[5], seems reasonable. The diﬀerent nuclear models used
in the present and DHF [4,5] calculations may also con-
tribute to the disagreement in X, which is determined by
the derivative of the electronic charge density at a single
point, the Tl origin. M is aﬀected by ψ in a broader
region, and is therefore far less sensitive to the nuclear
model.

The main goal of this work is the evaluation of electron
correlation eﬀects on the P, T -odd parameters. These ef-

fects are calculated by the RCC-SD method at the molec-
ular equilibrium separation Re. A major correlation con-
tribution is observed, decreasing M by 12% and X by
24%. Because of computational limitations, the highest
12 virtual orbitals (out of a total of 97 orbitals in the
molecular basis) have been excluded from the RCC-SD
step. Drawing upon a series of RCC-S and nonrelativistic
CC-SD calculations with and without exclusion of these
and other orbitals, we estimate the eﬀect of excluding the
12 highest virtual orbitals on the calculated parameters
at 3% or less.

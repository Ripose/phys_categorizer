Polynomial approximations around the global minimum of the adiabatic potential energy surface
of several polyatomic molecules display an unphysical saddle point of comparatively small energy,
leading to a region where the potential is negative and unbounded. This poses an energy upper
limit for a reliable evaluation of the vibrational levels. We argue that the presence of such saddle
points is general. The eﬀect of tunneling through the saddle is explored by means of non-perturbative
evaluations of vibrational spectra based on a tier by tier construction and an exact recursive equation
for the resolvent.

INTRODUCTION

comes (~ = 1):

The morphology of the adiabatic potential energy sur-
face (APES), especially its low-energy minima and sad-
dle points, is at the basis of the quantum chemistry of
reaction paths and conformational transitions.1 The adi-
abatic potential governs the low-energy vibrational dy-
namics of a rigid molecule of N atoms and is a compli-

bond lengths, bending or torsion angles (d = 3N
linear molecules). Its actual determination is usually a
very demanding problem,2 as the information contents of
a function of d coordinates grows exponentially with d.
A standard approximate parametrization is provided lo-
cally by a Taylor expansion around the global minimum

arated into the energy of a rigid rotator, a vibrational
term, and a mixed Coriolis term that is treated as a
perturbation. The simultaneous diagonalization of the

and sometimes reﬁned by comparison with spectroscopic
data.4 For a simple molecule such as water, the force con-
stants have been determined up to sixth order,5 and for
several polyatomic molecules the literature reports cal-
culations of third and fourth-order force constants.6,7,8,9
Hereafter, we shall refer to the (ﬁnite) polynomial poten-
tial in Eq. (2) as to the PP.

We consider the available data for the PP of several
molecules. In all cases we ﬁnd a saddle point, of com-
paratively small energy, leading to an unphysical disso-
ciative region where the potential is not bounded from
below. We also ﬁnd that, for most molecules, the poten-
tial well accomodates very few quantum levels up to the
saddle energy. To our surprise, this problem seems to be
neglected: its analysis is the main purpose of the present
study.

The standard use of the polynomial expansion (2) is
the calculation of a number of vibrational levels, usu-
ally by means of perturbation or variational theories, or
by numerical diagonalization. Contrary to ﬁnite-order
perturbative calculations, a non-perturbative determina-
tion of vibrational levels inevitably detects tunneling to
the unphysical region through the saddle. We show that
the presence of this unphysical saddle is a serious issue,
aﬀecting radically the range of applicability of exact cal-
culations based on the approximate PP. For this purpose

we develop and make use of a non-perturbative technique
(equivalent to exact diagonalization on a large basis) that
consists in a recursive evaluation of the Green function
in a reduced basis obtained by a “tier by tier” construc-
tion. The basic outcome of these exact calculations is
that converged vibrational levels do occur only in the
energy region below a quantum energy border, given by
the sum of the lowest saddle energy (the classical border)
plus a quantum correction. The latter is the zero-point
energy of the d
1 “transverse” modes (of positive cur-
vature) at the saddle point.

−

The paper is organized as follows: In Sec. II we present
the data for the lowest unphysical saddle point of some
molecules, based on force constants available in the lit-
erature, and give arguments for their general occurrence
in polynomial approximations of APES. The quantum
energy border for suppression of tunneling is introduced
in Sec. III. The inﬂuence of the quantum energy border
on the convergence of vibrational levels is illustrated by
applying our non-perturbative method to a simple two-
dimensional model. In Sec. IV we apply the method to
the water molecule, and in Sec. V we discuss the results
and the ensuing scenario. The computational method,
with the main iterative formula Eq. (A4), is presented in
the Appendix.

II. THE UNPHYSICAL SADDLE

A unique feature of the polynomial expansion in
Eq. (2) for the special case of diatomic molecules (d = 1)
is that many even-power terms are positive (for exam-
ple all even-power terms are positive for the Morse and
Lennard-Jones functions). As a consequence, the trunca-
tion of the series to a positive-coeﬃcient even power gives
a lower-bounded potential, and thus a well-deﬁned quan-
tum problem, characterized by an inﬁnite set of discrete
levels. This feature of d = 1 is unfortunately lost when
the power expansion (2) is used for polyatomic molecules
(d > 1): in all molecules which we could obtain the an-
harmonic parameters for, we veriﬁed the occurrence of
regions where the approximate PP is unbounded below.
Energy barriers separate diﬀerent minima of a phys-
ical APES, corresponding to diﬀerent local equilibrium
conﬁgurations (isomers) of the molecule. The isomeriza-
tion dynamics occurs mainly via quantum tunneling or
thermal activation through the lowest saddle of the bar-
rier .10 Likewise, for the PP, energy barriers separate the
region of the physical minimum around which the ex-
pansion is based and well grounded, from the unphysical
regions where the potential drops to
. The escape to
the unphysical region is driven by the lowest saddle which
introduces an energy “border” that limits the range for
(meta-stable) quantum levels allowed in the physical well
of the PP. Figure 1 illustrates this concept in a simple
d = 1-dimensional context, where we purposedly trun-
cated the polynomial expansion (2) to an odd order. It
is clear that the saddle lies in a region where the poly-

i.e. that tunneling indeed occurs through a single barrier

Table I reports the height Es of the lowest (unphysical)
saddle point of the PP for several polyatomic molecules,
measured from the bottom of the potential well. The
values of Es of diﬀerent molecules are determined by
the characteristic anharmonicities of the molecular bonds

and are thus fairly similar, in the 103
quartic PP (they are much lower for molecules character-
ized by soft torsional modes, such as methylene CH3OH).
Surprisingly, these saddles are low: about few times a
typical harmonic vibrational frequency of the molecule.
As a result, only few, if any, vibrational states sit be-
low Es. This is especially true for molecules with a large
number of atoms, where the ground-state energy is sub-
stantially above the bottom of the well, by an amount
proportional to d, that easily compares or exceeds the
saddle energy Es.

The occurrence of a saddle leading to an unphysical
region is by no means speciﬁc of the PP of the molecules
listed in Table I: we argue that this is a general feature
to be found in the PP of most polyatomic molecules.
Indeed, also for an even-power truncation, the PP can
in some direction in Q space30. The
easily drop to
precise value of the 4th-order parameters Φabcd (includ-
ing their sign) is determined by the local properties of
the true APES at its minimum Q = 0, not by any re-
quirement of conﬁning behavior at large distance: the PP
of a real molecule easily contains negative semi-diagonal
terms Φaabb and sizable mixed terms Φabcd, which in
turn produce regions where the PP drops to

an even-power truncated PP does not behave any better,
away from the physical minimum, than an odd-power
truncated PP. Therefore, we consider it extremely un-
likely (though technically possible) that a real polyatomic
molecular potential may ever be found whose polynomial
expansion at the minimum (truncated at any order > 2)
is lower-bounded everywhere.

III. THE QUANTUM ENERGY BORDER

As the PP has no lower bound, the associated Schr¨od-
inger problem is ill-deﬁned. However, resonant states
usually exist in the well and, provided that their tun-
neling rate through the barrier is low, they appear as
sharp peaks in the spectral density, at energies extremely
close to those of the Schr¨odinger equation restricted to
the well. The situation is similar to the well known
resonant states of the harmonic oscillator with cubic
perturbation.15 It thus makes sense to compute this spec-
trum of quasi-bound states not only perturbatively, but
also by exact methods. Of course, while perturbation
theory produces energy values regardless of their location
with respect to the saddle energy, an “exact” calculation

For d > 1, an eﬀect completely overlooked by the sim-
ple 1-dimensional picture of Fig. 1 is to be considered:
tunneling through the barrier at the saddle point is hin-
dered by the “transverse” motion of the degrees of free-
dom perpendicular to the one crossing the barrier. These
perpendicular degrees of freedom are associated to a min-
imum energy E⊥
zp due to Heisenberg’s uncertainty, that
adds to the saddle height to determine the quantum en-
ergy border for tunneling

Since, for most polyatomic molecules, E⊥
zp is close to the
zero-point energy of the ground state Ezp(0) (see Ta-

ers a spectral range (Ezp(0)

FIG. 5: Convergence of the spectrum as in Fig. 3, but for
initial excitation |vx = 0, vy = 4i perpendicular to the direction
of the saddle. Above Eqb (dashed line), the main features
appear to converge much better than with initial excitation
vx 6= 0, but the relative diﬀerence in the lower panel reveals
that convergence is poor anyway, due to tunneling.

Figure 3 reports the spectra computed for three largely
diﬀerent basis for the potential of Fig. 2(b) (ωs = 2.7).
One sees that the spectrum converges well until slightly
below the quantum border Eqb = 8.35, while above it
does not. To better illustrate the role of E⊥
zp = ωs/2,
Fig. 4 plots the relative diﬀerence between the spectra
computed on two diﬀerent basis (N = 50 and N = 100)
for the three potentials of Fig. 2. In the energy region
of convergence the relative diﬀerence, associated to dis-
placement of the peaks, is extremely small, and it grows
gradually as energy gets close to Eqb. As expected, the
region of convergence of the spectrum enlarges with ωs,
as Eqb increases. Quantum tunneling is exponentially
suppressed below the quantum border, and deteriorates
convergence as the border is approached.

is considered instead (Fig. 5), tunneling is suppressed,
since the overlap with the continuum of states outside
the well is very small. Indeed the main spectral struc-
tures remain more stable as comparison of Figs. 3 and
5 shows. However, even for this particularly favorable
initial state, convergence is illusory above Eqb, as the
relative diﬀerence in the lower panel of Fig. 5 indicates.

IV. A REAL MOLECULE: H2O

As an illustration of the applicability of the tiers
Green-function method to a realistic case and of the dif-
ﬁculties brought in by the energy border of the PP, we
compute the vibrational spectrum of water. We employ
the ab-initio quartic PP parameters listed in Table 6 of
Ref. 5. We take as initial state the harmonic fundamen-
tal excitation of the ω1 (symmetric OH stretching) mode,
and obtain the spectrum in Fig. 6. The peaks, represent-
ing exact vibrational levels, are assigned to the harmonic
quantum numbers of the closest state resulting from stan-
dard second-order perturbation theory.

Convergence is studied by increasing the tier number
from N = 5 (not shown in ﬁgure) to N = 10 and 15.
Convergence occurs below Eqb, and is satisfactory al-
ready using N = 5 tiers, thus showing the eﬀectiveness
of the tiers Green-function method applied to a realistic
problem. The deteriorated convergence above Eqb con-
ﬁrms that in that energy region the problem is ill posed
and signiﬁcant tunneling to the continuum occurs. In-
deed, since the lowest saddle lies in a direction involving
mainly mode 1, the chosen initial state
encour-
ages tunneling, like in the example of Fig. 3. However,
the relative stabililty of several features even above Eqb
indicates that a number of long-lived physical states in
the well decay fast enough through the saddle so that
their overlap to the outside continuum is fairly small.

V. DISCUSSION

We showed that, in general, polynomial approxima-
tions of molecular potentials display unphysical saddles
that lead to regions where the potential is not lower-
bounded. The height of the saddle and the zero-point en-
ergy of transverse modes both determine a quantum en-
ergy border below which tunneling is exponentially small.
Above this border, a non-perturbative evaluation shows
that convergence of the spectra is, in general, lost.

The present results cast a shadow on the use of the
polynomial approximations of the true APES for the cal-
culation of highly excited vibrational or roto-vibrational
spectra of polyatomic molecules, particularly in the IVR
(intramolecular vibrational relaxation) region. Even
though exact numerical methods, such as the Lanc-
zos or Davidson methods20,21,22,23 or the Green-function
method proposed here, are employed, the quantum me-
chanical problem is poorly deﬁned in that energy region.
The presence of weakly tunneling states above the quan-
tum energy border may justify the use of the PP for an
energy range beyond that of its rigorous applicability, as
was done in recent calculations of IVR spectra. However,
one should be aware that, as energy is raised above the
border, an increasing number of states, which would ex-
ist in perturbation theory, leave the tunneling regime and
couple more and more strongly to the continuum. This
is the source of severe convergence diﬃculties of exact
methods, and makes perturbative evaluations unreliable.
A real progress may be achieved by the use of smarter
parametrizations of the APES (e.g. based on Morse co-
ordinates), providing the correct large-Q behavior.

APPENDIX A: NON-PERTURBATIVE
EVALUATION OF THE GREEN FUNCTION.

We present a general procedure, inspired to Ref. 24
and there indicated as “tiers method”,
for the non-
perturbative evaluation of the eigenvalues and spectral
weights of a Hamiltonian decomposed as H = H0 + V .

It is assumed that the eigenvectors of H0 are well char-
acterized and that the matrix elements of V are easy
to compute and link any eigenstate of H0 with a ﬁ-
nite (not too large) number of other states. For deﬁ-
niteness, we consider the problem at hand of the vibra-
tional levels in a polynomial potential (2). The term
ωi(a†
i ai + 1/2) describes d independent oscilla-
H0 =
that specify
=
tors, with eigenvectors
the occupation numbers of the d oscillators. V is the
anharmonic part of the potential V anhar.

The ﬁrst step of the method is to partition the unper-
turbed eigenvectors in families (tiers), T0, T1, . . . of de-
creasing perturbative relevance. The construction is such
that the matrix representation of H is block-tridiagonal
in the tiers. Symbolically we write the blocks as Hii =

Next, we provide an exact iteration scheme for the eval-
uation of the matrix elements of the resolvent G(z) =
in Tier 0. The
(zI

the spectral weights:

The actual evaluation requires approximations such as
truncation of the tier generation to some order, and
possibly restriction of tier population. Anyhow, as the
method is iterative and in analogy with procedures that
approximate a self-energy, the resulting matrix elements
of G(0)(z) are highly non-perturbative.

Tier construction

Depending on the problem under investigation, a set of
t0 unperturbed states
(α = 1 . . . t0) is selected to
form the initial tier T0. In the computations of this paper,
T0 contains a single state, the bright state. The action
of V on T0 gives new vectors; the basis states that have
non-zero overlap with one of them, and are not in T0, are
collected in T1. We label them as
(α = 1 . . . t1).
For a ﬁnite set T0, and an interaction V which is a poly-
nomial in the raising and lowering operators, tier T1 and
subsequent ones, are ﬁnite.

Next we consider the set V T1, and expand it in the
eigenvectors already in T0 and T1, plus new ones that are
collected in tier T2. The process is iterated to produce
further tiers T3, T4, ... To this point the method is sim-
ply a smart algorithm to generate systematically a good
approximate basis for a quantum problem where some
non-interacting part H0 of the Hamiltonian can be sin-
gled out. Indeed, such a basis has been employed success-
fully in a diﬀerent context, in conjunction with standard
(Lanczos) techniques.25 However, the hierarchical basis
structure and the corresponding block-tridiagonal form
of the Hamiltonian, suggest a natural iterative method
to construct the spectrum.

Evaluation of the Resolvent

The iterative method is based on the following formula
for the inversion of partitioned matrices, with square di-
agonal blocks (we omit unneeded terms):

M =

M −1 =

one iterates (A4) back to the sought for matrix G(0)(z).

solves the quantum mechanical problem in the reduced
Hilbert space exactly. The basis can be enlarged system-
atically by increasing the number of tiers N , to achieve
convergence. When applied to the PP of a polyatomic
molecule the method provides automatically a rigorous
treatment of anharmonic resonances. The recursive cal-
culation of the Green’s function (A4) has several ad-
vantages with respect to the more traditional Lanczos
method:20,25,27,28 (i) it provides equal accuracy through
the whole spectrum, while Lanczos method is more accu-
rate close to the endpoints; (ii) it splits the Hilbert space
into subspaces T0, ...TN to treat one at a time; (iii) once
the chain of matrices is set up, each frequency requires
an independent calculation, which makes this method
suitable for parallel calculations. Its disadvantage is the
rapid growth of the tier size ti, for systems with many
degrees of freedom. To ﬁt the available CPU/memory
limits, it is possible to cutoﬀ the tier growth to some
maximum size tmax, as described in Ref. 25.
In gen-
eral, the recursive method may become very costly in
CPU time, since the evaluation of G(0)(E + iε) requires
N inversions for each sample frequency E, each inver-
sion costing a time proportional to t3
max. In the Lanczos
103 iterations, each
method, a single chain of NLanczos ≈
tmax,
costing of the order of the Hilbert space size
generates the whole spectrum.

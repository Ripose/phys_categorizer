Abstract

The generalized Heitler–London (GHL) theory provides a straightforward
way to express the potential energy surface of H3 in terms of Coulomb and
exchange energies which can be calculated either by perturbation theory or us-
ing the surface integral method (SIM). By applying the Rayleigh–Schr¨odinger
perturbation theory, GHL theory for the quartet spin state of H3 is shown
to yield results equivalent to the symmetrized Rayleigh–Schr¨odinger version
of symmetry adapted perturbation theory (SAPT). This equivalence allows
a comparison with the corresponding results obtained by the surface integral
method. The surface integral result calculated with a product of atomic wave
functions is found to have certain advantages over the perturbation approach.

I. INTRODUCTION

The generalized Heitler–London (GHL) theory provides a useful framework to calculate
the potential energy surfaces for polyatomic systems [1–4]. Since the potential energy is
expressed in terms of Coulomb and exchange energies it is possible to systematically separate
out many–body eﬀects in every single term contributing to the potential energy. In this paper
some aspects of the three–body exchange eﬀects occurring in H3 are examined in more detail.
Axilrod, Teller and Muto [5] were the ﬁrst to suggest a formula describing the leading
long range three–body dispersion term for three spherically symmetric atoms. Since then
the non–additive eﬀects have been intensively studied and several review articles have been
In the GHL approach the potentials can be decomposed into Coulomb

and exchange energies, whereas in symmetry adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) these
interactions are expressed in terms of Coulomb and exchange integrals in the manner ﬁrst
introduced by Heitler and London. Recently, SAPT was formulated for the interactions of
trimers [9] and has been applied to numerical calculations up to third order for the quartet
spin state of H3 [10] and for the helium–trimer [11] up to third order. Other three–body
calculations for H3 are based on Heitler–London type calculations [12] and perturbation

Coulomb and exchange part is as pointed out by the author himself not completely rigorous.
In a previous paper [3] analytical results were reported for the doublet as well as for
the quartet spin state for the H3 system based on the GHL theory. Two kinds of exchange
energies appear: cyclic exchange energies, where all three electrons are involved, and two–
body exchange energies in the presence of the respective third atom. The cyclic exchange
energy of three hydrogen and three helium atoms [14] was calculated using the surface

integral method (SIM) which was previously applied to two atoms [1, 2, 4, 15–17].
forthcoming paper [18] it will be demonstrated that all exchange energies occurring in the
H3–system can be calculated either by the surface integral method or by using perturbation
theory, and the corresponding results for the implicit three–body eﬀect on the two–body
exchange energies will be derived and compared.

For H2 it was previously shown that SAPT and GHL are equivalent [19]. The purpose of
this paper is to compare the surface integral method calculations of the three–body eﬀects in
the exchange energies based on an atomic product wave function with the results of ﬁrst to
third order of SAPT which are only available for the quartet spin state of H3 [10]. In order
to perform this comparison it is necessary to ﬁrst prove that the SAPT and GHL theory
expressions for the energy of the quartet state are equivalent. The results reveal that with
the zeroth order wave function the surface integral result contains parts of the second order
SAPT result and is therefore more eﬃcient.

In Sections II and III the basic ideas of the GHL theory and polarization approximation
are described. In Section IV the equivalence of the GHL and the symmetrized Rayleigh–
Schr¨odinger (SRS) theories is demonstrated order by order. The latter is designated a weak
symmetry forcing SAPT. Section V reviews the surface integral method (SIM). Thereafter
in Section VI the advantages of SIM over the perturbation approach will be demonstrated
by comparing the numerical results of perturbation theory and SIM.

II. GENERALIZED HEITLER–LONDON THEORY FOR H3

The application of generalized Heitler–London theory to H3 was previously discussed in

Ref. [3]. The generalized Heitler–London equation is given by

ˆHF =

ǫg ˆT (g)F

g
X

where F is the localized, i.e. non–symmetrized wave function, ˆT (g) designates a permutation
operator for the electron coordinates, and ǫg stands for the Coulomb (g = I) and exchange
energies (g 6= I). Applying results from the theory of the symmetric group, the energy
eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian can be derived. For the H3–system, the result for the two
doublet states is

1/2EGHL = ǫI − ǫ123 ±

[(ǫ12 − ǫ23)2 + (ǫ23 − ǫ13)2 + (ǫ13 − ǫ12)2]

s

and for the quartet state

3/2EGHL = ǫI − ǫ12 − ǫ23 − ǫ13 + 2ǫ123 .

The remainder of this paper will be concerned only with the quartet state.

III. POLARIZATION APPROXIMATION AND GENERALIZED
HEITLER–LONDON (GHL) THEORY

The Born–Oppenheimer non–relativistic Hamiltonian of the three–body system is given

by

using

A, ˆH 0

B and ˆH 0

C are the Hamiltonians of three free hydrogen atoms and ˆVAB, ˆVBC
where ˆH 0
and ˆVAC describe the interaction between atoms A and B, B and C, as well as A and C,
respectively. The polarization approximation [20] is based on the equation

where the polarization wave function F and the polarization energy Ep can be written as
perturbation series

ˆH = ˆH 0 + ˆV

ˆH 0 = ˆH 0

The zeroth order polarization wave function φ0 is the eigenfunction of the free Hamilto-
nian ˆH 0 and thus is a product of three free hydrogen wave functions. Starting from the
GHL equation with F chosen as the polarization wave function, Eq. (1) together with the
Hamiltonian Eq. (4) can be written as

The equalities Sn

and exchange energies can be expressed in terms of Coulomb, exchange and overlap integrals
and how the order–by–order contributions to the Coulomb and exchange energies can be
found.

The convergence properties of the polarization theory have been extensively discussed
for the case of two hydrogen atoms [21]. For low orders it was shown that the perturbation
series rapidly converges to the Coulomb energy [19, 21–23] though this is not the limit for
the inﬁnite order expansion. It is assumed that the behavior of this perturbation theory for
a system of two atoms also roughly holds in the case of three atoms [9, 10]. Since here we
are only interested in low orders, especially the ﬁrst, this expected behavior justiﬁes approx-
imating the localized wave function via the polarization approximation for three hydrogen
atoms as well.

IV. EQUIVALENCE OF THE GHL AND SRS THEORY FOR QUARTET H3

In this section the order–by–order equivalence of the complete energy expressions ob-
tained by using either the GHL or the SRS theory will be demonstrated. Both the GHL and
SRS theories start with the Hamiltonian Eq. (4) and a zeroth order wave function which is
a product of three free hydrogen atom wave functions. To demonstrate the equivalence of
the ﬁrst order expressions the ﬁrst order SRS term will be expressed in terms of Coulomb
and exchange energies. In Eq. (12) of Ref. [10] this term is given by

The rest of the proof will be done by complete induction. The claim of the induction is the

To perform a proof by induction it is necessary to show that also the (n+1)st order terms
of both theories are equal. To do so, the (n + 1)st order of GHL theory is expressed in terms
of the quantities occurring in SRS theory. This can be achieved by inserting the solutions
of the set of linear equations Eq. (12) into the complete GHL energy for the H3–quartet
state [24]

and the equality also holds for the (n + 1)st order. Thus the contributions to the energy of
the H3–quartet state in the SRS and GHL theories are equal order by order.

One advantage of the GHL theory is that it permits the calculation of the exchange
In Ref. [10], the non–
energies by other methods, such as the surface integral method.
additive energy terms of the quartet spin state of H3 have been calculated up to third order.
The ﬁrst order terms can be split into a polarization and an exchange part. Since the ﬁrst
order polarization energy is pairwise additive, the only non–additive term in ﬁrst order is
contained in the exchange term which in Eqs. (23) and (55) of Ref. [9] is given by

V. SURFACE INTEGRAL METHOD (SIM) FOR THE CALCULATION OF
EXCHANGE ENERGIES

As shown in Refs. [14] and [18] all exchange energies occurring in the GHL–description of
the H3 system, i.e. the two–body as well as the cyclic exchange energies, can be calculated
by the surface integral method (SIM). The exchange energy ǫg0 associated with the arbitrary
group element g0 6= I is given accordingly by

In order to compare numerical results for three–body exchange eﬀects with the published
SAPT results for H3 [10], an expression for the non–additive exchange energy has to be ob-
tained using SIM. The non–additive exchange energy basically contains the cyclic exchange

7

energy and the implicit three–body eﬀects on the two–body exchange energies. As already
pointed out in Ref. [14] it can be shown that for a choice of the partial volume V such
that F is localized inside, all quantities occurring in the sum of Eq. (42) go to zero with
at least a factor of e−R faster than the surface integral itself if all internuclear distances
are larger or equal to R. This holds for all exchange energies. In a diﬀerent paper [18] it
will be shown how to ﬁnd the implicit three–body eﬀect from the complete surface integral
expression for the two–body exchange energies. For product wave functions as used here
the pure two–body part is given by the ﬁrst line of formula Eq. (42), i.e. surface integral
(SI) over denominator. The implicit three–body eﬀect is contained in the second line of Eq.
(42), i.e. the products of partial overlap integrals with exchange energies. Following the
same scheme used in the Appendix of Ref. [14], these terms can be shown to asymptotically
go to zero as e−5R which is faster by a factor of e−3R than the surface integral (SI) itself.

Using these results a GHL non–additive exchange energy for the quartet state of H3
can be deﬁned by simply subtracting the pure two–body contribution from the two–body
exchange energies in the GHL result for the quartet state Eq. (3)

A comparison of the numerical results of the ﬁrst order non–additive exchange energy
Eq. (41) of SRS theory and the GHL term [Eq. (44)] calculated by SIM using the zeroth
order product wave function F = 1/π3/2 exp(−r1A − r2B − r3C) is given in Tables I and II
and will be discussed in the next Section.

In summary, the complete three–body exchange eﬀect in H3, which consists of the cyclic
exchange energy and the eﬀect of the presence of the third atom on the two–body exchange
energies, can asymptotically be approximated by the surface integral for the cyclic exchange
energy.

VI. RESULTS

In Tables I and II as well as Figures 1 and 2 the numerical results for the ﬁrst order
non–additive exchange energy of SRS theory are compared with three diﬀerent SIM–terms:
(i) the non–additive exchange energy of GHL theory Eq. (43), (ii) the cyclic exchange energy
(complete SIM expression Eq. (42) with overlaps), (iii) the surface integral (SI) of the cyclic
exchange energy only (without overlaps). All these quantities have been calculated using the
zeroth order localized wave function F = 1/π3/2 exp(−r1A − r2B − r3C). Since the exchange
energies calculated by SIM cannot be given a deﬁnite perturbative order (due to the fact that
only part of the complete space is used in the calculation) the quantity (i) is not expected
to yield the same numerical results as the ﬁrst order non–additive exchange energy of SRS
theory. But since the same zeroth order product wave function was used to calculate both

8

terms it is expected that both quantities exhibit a similar overall behavior in the range of
parameters studied.

In Table I results for equilateral triangular geometry of the nuclei ranging between R = 4
and R = 10 atomic units are listed. Generally, all terms calculated by SIM have smaller
absolute values than the ﬁrst order perturbative ones. At R = 4 a.u., the absolute value of
the complete SIM term Eq. (43) is 27 % below the SRS result Eq. (41), the cyclic exchange
energy is 38 % smaller, and only the surface integral of the cyclic exchange energy is 25 %
greater in absolute value. At R = 10 a.u., however, all three quantities calculated by SIM
are no longer distinguishable and are only 6 % below the SRS result.

In Table II the results for isosceles triangles with equal sides of length of 6 a.u. and with
angles γB varying between 30◦ and 180◦ are shown. All quantities except for the surface
integral without overlaps exhibit a change of sign in the region around 120◦ and 150◦. At
30◦, (i) the absolute value of the SIM term Eq. (43) is 31 % smaller than the SRS result,
(ii) the cyclic exchange energy is 41 % smaller, and again (iii) the surface integral of the
cyclic exchange energy only is 13 % greater in absolute value. At 180◦ on the other hand,
only the value for the surface integral has the wrong sign, while both the other terms have
become indistinguishable and are now 35 % greater in absolute value than the SRS term.
The diﬀerences between the numerical results for the quantities compared in Tables I and
II are, as already pointed out, not due to numerical problems but due to the fact that the
quantities are diﬀerent by deﬁnition.

From the Tables it appears that for triangular geometries of the nuclei and internuclear
distances R ≥ 4 a.u. the ﬁrst order non–additive exchange energy for the quartet state of
H3 can be quite well approximated by the surface integral of the cyclic exchange energy.
This was stated in Ref. [14] and has now been explained by the fact that all the SIM
approximations (see section V and in Ref. [14]) hold in this region.

In Tables III and IV as well as Figures 1 and 2 higher orders of SRS theory are also
taken into account and compared with the complete GHL non–additive exchange energy Eq.
(43) in order to show that SIM goes beyond the ﬁrst order of SRS theory. For equilateral
triangular geometries of the nuclei and internuclear distances larger than 6 a.u. the results
of GHL theory lie between the ﬁrst order SRS term and the sum of the ﬁrst and second
order terms, approaching the ﬁrst order term for increasing distances. At 6 a.u. GHL is
very close to the ﬁrst plus second order of SRS, and even at 4 a.u. GHL is only 17 % below
the total sum up to third order of SRS theory.

For isosceles structures of the nuclei with equal internuclear distances of 6 a.u.
the
advantage of SIM over the ﬁrst order SRS theory is even more apparent. Starting at 60◦,
the GHL result is closer to the ﬁrst plus second order than to the ﬁrst order SRS term. The
change of sign occurs for the ﬁrst order between 120◦ and 150◦ whereas for all other terms
already between 90◦ and 120◦. The diﬀerences of the GHL to the ﬁrst plus second order
SRS term range from 0.4% at 60◦ to 33% at 120◦ and 10% at 180◦. At 30◦ the GHL result
is again only 16% smaller than the SRS term with the third order term included.

The advantage of SIM over the perturbative approach is that the surface integral SI is
easily calculated numerically, and including the partial overlap terms provides part of the
second order SRS contributions.

VII. CONCLUSIONS

This paper demonstrates how the perturbation series consisting of Coulomb, exchange
and overlap integrals can be used to express the Coulomb and exchange energies occurring
in GHL theory. Combining the perturbation series with the GHL theory yields an energy
expression for the quartet spin state equivalent to that of symmetrized Rayleigh–Schr¨odinger
perturbation theory given in [10].

It is possible to evaluate the exchange energies using the surface integral method (SIM).
The SIM has the advantage that it derives from a clear physical picture for the exchange
process in terms of the electrons continuously trading places. For the cyclic exchange energies
this method has already been described in detail in Ref. [14], and for the implicit three–body
eﬀect on the two–body exchange energies it will be shown in Ref. [18].

The long range behavior of the three–body terms entering the two–body exchange ener-
gies and of the partial overlap integrals — multiplied by two–body exchange energies in the
expression for the cyclic exchange energy in Eq. (42) — indicate that for large internuclear
separations the surface integral for the cyclic exchange energy is suﬃcient to describe the
non–additive contribution to the exchange part of the quartet spin state. The numerical
results in Tables I and II conﬁrm this conclusion.

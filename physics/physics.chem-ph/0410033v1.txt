On dynamical tunneling and classical resonances

(Dated: December 30, 2013)

This letter establishes a ﬁrm relationship between classical nonlinear resonances and the phe-
nomenon of dynamical tunneling. It is shown that the classical phase space with its hierarchy of
resonance islands completely characterizes dynamical tunneling. In particular, it is not important
to invoke criteria such as the size of the islands and presence or absence of avoided crossings for a
consistent description of dynamical tunneling in near-integrable systems.

Dynamical tunneling as a concept emerged more than
two decades ago in the ﬁeld of chemical physics where
it results in the transport of vibrational quanta be-
tween degenerate modes - a process that would be clas-
sically forbidden. The importance of dynamical tunnel-
ing in the molecular context can be hardly overstated
since this phenomenon provides a route to energy ﬂow
through the molecule in the absence of direct classi-
cally resonant mechanisms. Early pioneering work1,2,3,4,6
mainly by the chemical physics community provided both
semiclassical1,2 and purely quantum perspectives3,4 on
dynamical tunneling. Semiclassically the phase space is
the natural setting whereas the quantum approach in-
vokes high order perturbation theory involving a chain of
oﬀ-resonant virtual states (vibrational superexchange4).
Although seemingly diﬀerent, there are hints4,5 towards
a connection between the two perspectives and this paper
attempts to provide further clues.

The initial suggestion2 regarding the importance of
phase space structures to dynamical tunneling has
been intensely studied and established by the nonlin-
ear dynamics community over the last decade7,8,9,10,11,12.
Dynamical
tunneling is found not only to be in-
ﬂuenced by chaos8,9,12 but also by various nonlin-
ear resonances5,10,11,12 with some recent experimental
support13.
In the molecular context Heller recently14
made a number of interesting observations and conjec-
tures on the possible implications of dynamical tunneling
on high resolution molecular spectra15. The most impor-
tant amongst these is the claim that a nominal 10−1-10−2
cm−1 broadening of spectroscopically prepared zeroth or-
der states is due to dynamical tunneling between remote
regions of phase space facilitated by distant resonances.
Arguments were provided for identifying the speciﬁc res-
onances and subsequent calculation of the splittings. The
purpose of this letter is to conﬁrm the above claim via
a detailed analysis of a relatively simple, albeit realis-
tic, model spectroscopic Hamiltonian. The analysis also
indicates that the correspondence between classical res-
onances and avoided crossings, while interesting, is not
needed for an understanding of dynamical tunneling.

classical limit16 of the above Hamiltonian is a nonlin-

responding to the action-angle variables associated with
the mode j. In particular the classical limit of ˆV (ij)
is of
p:q
the form 2qI q
pθj). ˆH can be obtained by
a ﬁt to the high resolution experimental spectra or from
a perturbative analysis of a high quality ab initio poten-
tial energy surface. In either case such eﬀective Hamil-
tonians provide a very natural and convenient represen-
tation to understand the spectral patterns of molecular
systems18. Note that despite the three coupled modes,
ˆH is eﬀectively two dimensional due to the existence of
the conserved quantity P = (n1 + n2) + nb/2 called as
the polyad number. The classical Hamiltonian is inte-
grable if β = 0 and for our choice of parameters it is
near-integrable if β
= 0. Throughout this study we ﬁx
P = 8 and β = 26.57 cm−1 and denote, due to conserved
P , the zeroth-order states by

are an inﬁnite number of chains that connect the two de-
generate states. In practice, due to the energy denomina-
tors and near-integrability, it is suﬃcient to consider the
minimal length chains5. In our case there are six minimal
chains and summing the contributions from each one of
them one obtains a splitting of about 0.23 cm−1. This
compares well with the exact splitting but it is impor-
tant to note that all six perturbative terms have to be
considered for this agreement. Note that although for-
mally the superexchange approach invokes the resonant
terms the connection to the classical phase space is lost.

the phase space then surely there must be a phase space
analog of the superexchange approach. The rest of the
paper is dedicated to uncovering precisely such a phase
space picture.

As mentioned the primary 2:1 resonances do not ap-
pear in the phase space at E = E0
2,0,12 and hence a direct
involvement is ruled out. Nevertheless a weak overlap be-
tween the 2:1s can result in an induced 1:1 resonance
which can then mediate dynamical tunneling between
the states. In Fig. 2a we show the surface of section at
E = E0
2,0,12 and one indeed observes a resonance island
between the two states. In order to conﬁrm the nature of
this resonance zone we use standard methods of nonlin-
ear dynamics19 to extract the necessary information. In
essence one starts with the classical Hamiltonian involv-
ing only the 2:1 perturbations in the form16

with βc = β/√2 and N being the classical analog of
the polyad number. A formal parameter ǫ has been in-
troduced with the aim of perturbatively removing the
2:1 resonances, characterized by ψ1,2, to O(ǫ). This
can be done by invoking the generating function F =
¯J1ψ1 + ¯J2ψ2 + ǫ[g1 sin ψ1 + g2 sin ψ2] where the functions
g1,2 = g1,2( ¯J1, ¯J2) are determined by the condition of the
removal of the primary 2:1s to O(ǫ). The angles con-
jugate to ¯J are denoted by ¯ψ. The procedure is alge-
braically tedious and we skip the details to provide the

important results. The choice of the functions g1,2 turns
out to be:

with f ( ¯J1, ¯J2; N ) being a complicated function of the
actions. At this stage the transformed Hamiltonian to
O(ǫ2) still depends on both the angles ¯ψ1 and ¯ψ2 and
hence non-integrable.
In order to isolate the induced
1:1 resonance we perform a canonical transformation
to the variables (K, φ) using the generating function

in a pendulum Hamiltonian describing the induced 1:1
resonance island structure seen in the surface of section
shown in Fig. 2a. Within the averaged approximation the
action K2 = ¯J1 + ¯J2 is a constant of the motion and can
be identiﬁed as the 1:1 polyad associated with the sec-
ondary resonance. The resulting integrable Hamiltonian

cm−1 agrees very well with the exact splitting. This
proves that the induced 1:1 resonance arising from the
interaction of the two primary 2:1 resonances is mediat-
ing dynamical tunneling between the degenerate states.
At this juncture it is important to note that the induced
resonance strength is quite small and the two states are
not involved in any avoided crossing. Moreover, from a
superexchange perspective it is illuminating to note that
the splitting can be calculated trivially by recognizing the
secondary phase space structure (a viewpoint emphasized
in Ref. 11 as well). In comparison the original superex-
change calculation, without any reference to the phase
space, required taking into account 6 terms with varying
signs20. This observation emphasizes the superior nature
of a phase space viewpoint on dynamical tunneling.

As a further demonstration of the role of nonlinear res-
onances in dynamical tunneling we consider the Hamil-
= 0 with γ = 0. In particular the
tonian in eq. 1 with g
sign of the primary 1:1 perturbation strength g is taken
to be the opposite of the induced 1:1 strength gind. If the
induced resonance is playing a role then from our anal-
ysis we expect that the primary and induced resonances
2gind/(m + 1)
will cancel each other around g = g0 ≈ −
resulting in small splittings in this region. In Fig. 3 the
exact splittings are shown as a function of g with the
WKB results3,4 for comparison. This conﬁrms our ex-
pectations to a certain degree in that the splittings are
undergoing dramatic changes in the vicinity of g0. A
crucial observation is that the exact splitting is orders
of magnitude larger than the simple WKB estimate and

6
become small slightly away from g0. On the other hand
the classical phase space in Fig. 2 indicates the predicted
disappearance of the 1:1 islands. From our arguments
this far it would be natural to associate one or more high
order nonlinear resonances with the residual tunneling
around g0 since the simple semiclassical estimate for g0
was based on the O(ǫ2) induced 1:1 resonance cancelling
the primary 1:1 resonance. In reality there are the har-
monics of the 1:1 resonance that appear at higher orders
in ǫ.
It is expected that the strengths of such higher
harmonics like 2:2, 3:3, etc. would be extremely small.
Nevertheless around g = g0 the most dominant resonance
involved in dynamical tunneling would be the 2:2. The
strength of this tiny but dominant 2:2 resonance can be
estimated roughly by adding a 2:2 perturbation (γ) to
eq. 1 with β = 26.57 cm−1, g = g0 and noting the value
of γ for which the exact and WKB results come close.
A much more rigorous estimate, which is a diﬃcult ex-
cersise in classical perturbation theory, can be made by
going to higher orders, atleast O(ǫ3), in ǫ. We now esti-
mate the splitting with a WKB calculation including the
10−4 cm−1. It
2:2 resonance with strength γ
is clear from Fig. 3 that the exact splitting and the mod-
iﬁed WKB estimate based on the higher order 2:2 agree
fairly well. It is also satisfying to see that the modiﬁed
WKB calculation hardly eﬀects the splittings far away
from g = g0. As an independent check in Fig. 3(inset)
we show the same calculation for a diﬀerent set of ˆH0 pa-
rameters representative of the D2O molecule17 and the
results are similar. This supports the argument that in
the vicinity of g0, where the 1:1 resonance is absent, the
extremely small 2:2 resonance is mediating the dynam-
. Two
ical tunneling between the states
i
remarks are in order at this stage. First the two states do
not undergo any avoided crossing as a function of the pa-
rameter g. This can also be indirectly inferred from the
fact that a superexchange calculation of the splittings
essentially reproduces the exact result and thus include

the importance of higher order resonances near g = g0.
A more detailed analysis of the perturbative chains from
the semiclassical viewpoint would be interesting. Sec-
ond the modiﬁed WKB calculation is in good agreement
with the exact splittings only in the vicinity of g0 by ne-
cessity. There are contributions from even higher order
resonances which are absent from our simpliﬁed analysis
and a subtle interplay of all the nonlinear resonances give
rise to the exact result.

To summarize, in this work using a model spectro-
scopic Hamiltonian we have demonstrated the intimate
connection between dynamical tunneling and the reso-
nance structure of the classical phase space. Thus dy-
namical tunneling connects two degenerate states as long
as there is a nonlinear resonance juxtaposed between
them as viewed in the phase space. The order and width
of the resonance are immaterial. This supports an earlier
claim regarding the possibility of dynamical tunneling
as a source of narrow spectral clusters associated with
spectroscopically prepared, localized, zero-order states.
However the notion that such resonances are the cause
of avoided crossings does not seem to hold. Consequently
it is also not necessary that only a speciﬁc classical reso-
nance be the agent of dynamical tunneling. Primary, in-
duced and even higher harmonics of the resonances can
mediate dynamical tunneling and the consequences for
energy ﬂow and control from this standpoint seem crucial
and needs further study. It is interesting to note that in
multidimensional near-integrable systems nonlinear res-
onances would be involved in two long time phenomena -
dynamical tunneling and Arnol’d diﬀusion19. The com-
petition between them and their spectral consequences
are worth investigating from a fundamental standpoint21.

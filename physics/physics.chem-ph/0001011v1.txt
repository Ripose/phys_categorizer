Abstract

A theoretical treatment based upon the quasi-chemical theory of solutions
predicts the most probable number of water neighbors in the inner shell of
a Li+ ion in liquid water to be four. The instability of a six water molecule
inner sphere complex relative to four-coordinated structures is conﬁrmed by
an ‘ab initio’ molecular dynamics calculation. A classical Monte Carlo simu-
+
lation equilibrated 26 water molecules with a rigid six-coordinated Li(H2O)6
complex with periodic boundary conditions in aqueous solution. With that
initial conﬁguration for the molecular dynamics, the six-coordinated structure
relaxed into four-coordinated arrangements within 112 fs and stabilized. This
conclusion diﬀers from prior interpretations of neutron and X-ray scattering
results on aqueous solutions.

The hydration of ions in water is not only fundamental to physical chemistry but also
relevant to the current issue of selectivity of biological ion channels.
In the context of
potassium channels [1,2,3], for example, the free energies for replacement of inner shell
water ligands with peptide carbonyls donated by proteins of the channel structure seem
decisive to the selectivity of the channel, speciﬁcally for preference of K+ over Na+. Studies
to elucidate the thermodynamic features of such inner shell exchange reactions require prior
knowledge of the ion hydration structures and energetics.

Unfortunately, our understanding of the inner hydration shell structure of ions in wa-
ter is not as clear as it might be [4]. The simplest and most favorable case to pursue is
the Li+ solute. Neutron scattering measurements on LiCl solutions in liquid water have
led to a ﬁrm conclusion that the Li+ ion has six near-neighbor water molecule partners
[4,5,6,7,8,9,10]. That result, however, has not been entirely uniform across studies of similar
aqueous solutions [11,12] containing Li+ ions. X-ray scattering results have been interpreted
similarly [13] to indicate a hydration number of six, again with some nonuniformity [14]. In
contrast, some spectroscopic studies have suggested tetrahedral coordination of the Li+ ion
in water [15] and an array of physical chemical inferences lend some support to that con-
clusion [16]. On the theoretical side, electronic structure calculations on the Li+ ion with
six water molecules predict a slightly, but distinctly, lower energy for a structure with four
inner shell and two outer shell water molecules than for structures with six water molecules
in the innermost shell [17,18]; results such as those seem to be universally supported by
other electronic structure eﬀorts [19,20]. Simulations have produced a range of results in-
cluding both four and six inner shell water neighbors with considerable statistical dispersion
[21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32]. It is well recognized, of course, that simulations are
typically not designed to provide a sole determination of such properties, though they do
shed light on the issues determining the hydration number of ions in water.

The theoretical scheme used here to address these problems for the Li+(aq) ion is based
upon the quasi-chemical organization of solution theory, which is naturally suited to these
problems [33,34,35,36]. The ﬁrst step is the study of the reactions

Li+ + nH2O ⇀↽ Li(H2O)n

+

(1)

that combine n water molecule ligands with the Li+ ion in a geometrically deﬁned inner
sphere under ideal gas conditions. At a subsequent step an approximate, physical description
of the aqueous environment surrounding these complexes is included [33,34,35,36]. The
geometric deﬁnition of an inner sphere region enforces a physical balance in this method.
The goal of this approach is to treat inner sphere ligands explicitly, in molecular detail,
but at the same time to achieve a description of outer sphere hydration thermodynamics
that is consistent from one complex to another.
If minimum energy complex geometries
were to shift diﬀerent numbers of ligands to outer sphere regions, that would unbalance the
thermodynamic description of the hydration of the inner sphere materials. For example, in
the quantitative implementation of the quasi-chemical approach we speciﬁcally do not use
the Li[(H2O)4][(H2O)2]+ complex cited above, with two water molecules outside the inner
sphere, even though this structure helpfully clariﬁes the physical issue.

Gas-phase thermochemical data required for the equilibria in Eq. (1) were obtained
by electronic structure calculations using the Gaussian98 programs with the B3LYP hybrid
density functional theory approximation [37]. All structures were fully optimized with a basis

2

including polarization functions on Li+ (6-31G*) and both polarization and diﬀuse functions
(6-31++G**) on the oxygen and hydrogen centers. At the optimum geometry and with the
same basis set, harmonic vibrational frequencies of the clusters were calculated and atomic
charges determined using the ChelpG capability in Gaussian98. Partition functions were
then calculated, thus providing a determination of the free energy changes of the equilibria
in Eq. (1) due to atomic motions internal to the clusters within the harmonic approximation.
Interactions of these complexes with the external aqueous environment [34] were treated
with a dielectric model following the previous study of the hydrolysis of the ferric ion [35].
Classic electrostatic interactions based upon the ChelpG partial atomic charges were the only
solution-complex interactions treated; in particular, repulsive force (overlap) interactions
were neglected based on the expectation that they make a secondary contribution to the
thermodynamic properties considered here. The external boundary of the volume enclosed
by spheres centered on all atoms deﬁned the solute molecular surface. The sphere radii were
those determined empirically by Stefanovich and Truong [38], except RLi+=2.0 ˚A for the
lithium ion. Because the lithium ion is well buried by the inner shell waters, slight variations
of the lithium radius were found to be unimportant. The value RLi+=2.0 ˚A was identiﬁed
as slightly larger than the nearest Li-O distances and signiﬁcantly smaller than the Li-O
distances (3.5 – 4.0 ˚A) for second shell pairs.

Results of the calculations are summarized in Fig. 1. Geometry optimization of each of
the n-coordinated clusters conﬁrms that the inner shell structures used in these calculations
are not necessarily the lowest energy structures for a given number of water neighbors.
Although a tetrahedral cluster of inner shell water molecules is the lowest energy structure
+, a cluster with ﬁve inner shell water molecules is slightly higher in energy
for Li(H2O)4
than a cluster with one outer shell and four inner shell water molecules. Similarly, the
lowest energy cluster with six water molecules contains four inner shell water molecules
arranged tetrahedrally and two outer shell water molecules.

Fig. 1 shows that the n=4 inner sphere cluster has the lowest free energy for a dilute
(p=1 atm) ideal gas phase. Adjustment of the concentration of water molecules to the value
ρW = 1 g/cm3, to match the normal density of liquid water, changes the most favored cluster
to the one with n=6 inner shell water molecules. Outer sphere interactions described by
the dielectric model progressively destabilize the larger clusters, as they should since larger
numbers of water molecules are being treated explicitly as members of the inner shell. As
a consequence of including the outer sphere contributions, the ﬁnal position of minimum
free energy is returned to the n=4 structure, with the n=3 complex predicted to be next
most populous in liquid water at T=298.15 K and p=1 atm. The mean hydration number
predicted by this calculation is n=4.0.

The current quasi-chemical prediction for the absolute hydration free energy of the Li+
ion under these conditions is -128 kcal/mol, not including any repulsive force (packing) con-
tributions. An extreme increase of RLi+ to 2.65 ˚A raises this value to about -126 kcal/mol,
showing that the theoretical results are insensitive to the ion radius, as remarked above.
Experimental values are -113 kcal/mol [39], -118 kcal/mol [40], and -125 kcal/mol [41],
converted to this standard state. This dispersion of experimental values for the absolute
hydration free energy of the Li+ (aq) ion is accurately mirrored in the dispersion of refer-
ence values adopted for the absolute hydration free energy of the H+ (aq) ion. Inclusion
of repulsive force contributions would reduce the present calculated value slightly. Further-

3

more, Li+(aq) is believed to have a strongly structured second hydration shell [23], which is
treated only approximately in this calculation. Nevertheless, this level of agreement between
calculation and experiment is satisfactory.

We additionally emphasize that the Li(H2O)n

+ complexes are treated in the harmonic
approximation, although fully quantum mechanically. The low-n clusters might have more
entropy than is being accounted for by the harmonic approximation. If this were the case,
then low-n clusters would be more populous than currently represented. This would likely
raise the theoretical value also.

To further test the n=4 prediction, ‘ab initio’ molecular dynamics calculations were car-
ried out utilizing the VASP program [42]. Two checks established the consistency for these
problems between the electronic structure calculations described above and the energet-
ics involved in the molecular dynamics calculations. First, the electron density functional
alternative implemented in VASP [43] was checked by comparing the electronic structure
results obtained with the B3LYP hybrid electron density functional and the PW91 general-
ized gradient approximation exchange-correlation functional, using the Gaussian98 program
and the same basis sets. As expected, satisfactory agreement was observed in the binding
+ clusters. Then the
energies for sequential addition of a water molecule to the Li(H2O)n
issues of pseudo-potentials and basis set were checked by optimizing cluster geometries with
the VASP program and comparing to the results obtained for the same problems with Gaus-
sian98. Again agreement was observed. For example, both procedures predicted the same
lowest energy six-coordinated structure, the characteristic Li[(H2O)4][(H2O)2]+ cluster, with
nearly identical geometries.

To initiate the ‘ab initio’ molecular dynamics calculation, the optimum n=6 inner sphere
structure, rigidly constrained, was ﬁrst equilibrated with 26 water molecules under conven-
tional Monte Carlo liquid simulation conditions for liquid water, including periodic boundary
conditions. This system of one Li+ ion and 32 water molecules was then used as an initial
conﬁguration for the molecular dynamics calculation. As shown in Fig. 2, the initial n=6
structure relaxed to stable n=4 alternatives within 112 fs. The results of longer molecular
dynamics calculations will be reported later.

The ‘ab initio’ molecular dynamics and the quasi-chemical theory of liquids exploit dif-
ferent approximations and produce the same conclusion here. This agreement supports the
prediction that Li+(aq) has four inner shell water ligands at inﬁnite dilution in liquid water
under normal conditions. This prediction diﬀers from interpretations of neutron and X-ray
scattering data on aqueous solutions.

The conditions studied by these calculations and those targeted in the neutron scattering
work do not match perfectly, particularly with regard to Li+ concentration. Nevertheless, the
theoretical methods are straightforward and physical, and, moreover, the distinct methods
used here conform in their prediction of hydration number. Therefore, it will be of great
importance for future work to fully resolve the diﬀerences between calculations and scattering
experiments for these problems.

the concentration of water molecules to the normal concentration of liquid water, ρW =
1 g/cm3 so that RTρW = 1354 atm [35]. The minimum value is at n=6. The topmost graph

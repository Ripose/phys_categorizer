Abstract

The total atomization energy at absolute zero, (TAE0) of benzene, C6H6,

was computed fully ab initio by means of W2h theory as 1306.6 kcal/mol,

to be compared with the experimentally derived value 1305.7±0.7 kcal/mol.

The computed result includes contributions from inner-shell correlation (7.1

kcal/mol), scalar relativistic eﬀects (-1.0 kcal/mol), atomic spin-orbit split-

ting (-0.5 kcal/mol), and the anharmonic zero-point vibrational energy (62.1

kcal/mol). The largest-scale calculations involved are CCSD/cc-pV5Z and

CCSD(T)/cc-pVQZ; basis set extrapolations account for 6.3 kcal/mol of the

ﬁnal result. Performance of more approximate methods has been analyzed.

Our results suggest that, even for systems the size of benzene, chemically accu-

rate molecular atomization energies can be obtained from fully ﬁrst-principles

calculations, without resorting to corrections or parameters derived from ex-

periment.

Computational thermochemistry is coming of age as part of the chemist’s toolbox [1].

Popular approaches (such as G3 theory [2] and CBS-QB3 [3]) that can lay claim to ‘chemical

accuracy’ (1 kcal/mol) on average for small systems, invariably rely on a combination of

relatively low-level ab initio calculations and sophisticated empirical correction schemes,

which have been parametrized against experimental data.

In recent years, a number of groups have focused on obtaining accurate thermodynamic

data of small molecules by means of fully ab initio approaches (i.e. devoid of parameters

derived from experiment); the reader is referred to studies by e.g. Dixon [4,5], Klopper [6],

Bauschlicher [7], and Martin [8]. Very recently, we developed two near-black box methods of

this type, known as W1 and W2 theory (for Weizmann-1 and -2, respectively); in the original

paper [9] and a subsequent validation study [10] for most of the G2/97 data set [11,12], we

have shown that these methods yield thermochemical data in the kJ/mol accuracy range for

small systems that are well described by a single reference conﬁguration.

The question arises as to how well such methods would ‘scale up’ to larger systems. For

this purpose, the ubiquitous benzene molecule would appear to oﬀer an excellent ‘stress

test’. It has six heavy atoms, yet its heat of formation is known precisely from experiment,

and its high symmetry makes it amenable to fairly large-scale treatments with modern high-

performance computing hardware. In the present note, we shall discuss the performance the

total atomization energy (TAEe if zero-point exclusive, TAE0 at 0 K) of benzene of the more

rigorous W2h theory, of the more widely applicable W1 and W1h theories, and of a variety

of more approximate approaches.

All calculations involved in W1, W1h, and W2h theory were carried out using MOLPRO

98.1 [13] running on a Compaq ES40 minisupercomputer in our laboratory. (For the open-

shell calculations on carbon, the deﬁnition of the CCSD(T) [14] energy according to Ref.

[15] has been used.) Detailed descriptions and justiﬁcations of the various steps involved

can be found in Refs. [9,10]. We merely note here that, for the system under study, the

ﬁnal result at the highest level of theory (W2h) consists of the following components: (a) an

SCF limit extrapolated from SCF/cc-pVnZ (correlation consistent polarized valence n-tuple

2

zeta [16], with n=T,Q,5) energies using the formulas E(n) = E∞ + B/C n (old style [9])

or E(n) = E∞ + A/n5 (new style [10]); (b) a CCSD valence correlation limit extrapolated

from CCSD/cc-pVnZ (n=Q,5) results using E(n) = E∞ + A/n3; (c) a limit for the ef-

fect of connected triple excitations extrapolated from [CCSD(T)/cc-pVnZ–CCSD/cc-pVnZ]

(n=T,Q) using E(n) = E∞ + A/n3; (d) an inner-shell correlation contribution obtained at

the CCSD(T)/MTsmall level; (e) a scalar relativistic (1st-order Darwin and mass-velocity

[17,18]) contribution obtained as an expectation value from the ACPF/MTsmall [19] wave

function; (f) a ﬁrst-order spin-orbit correction derived from the ﬁne structure of the con-

stituent atoms; and (g) the anharmonic zero-point energy (vide infra). The computationally

most intensive step was the CCSD/cc-pV5Z calculation. At 876 basis functions, with 30

electrons correlated, this could not be carried out using a conventional algorithm even while

exploiting the D2h subgroup of D6h; using the direct CCSD algorithm of Lindh, Sch¨utz, and

Werner [20] as implemented in MOLPRO, it took 14 days of CPU time on a 667 MHz Alpha

EV67 CPU with 768 MB of memory allocated. (The CCSD(T)/cc-pVQZ optimum geometry

required for the W2h calculations was taken from Ref. [21].)

The W1h calculations primarily diﬀer in that the extrapolations are carried out with

smaller cc-pVnZ (n=D,T,Q) basis sets (and E(n) = E∞ + A/n3.22 for the correlation steps,

see [9] for its derivation), while in W1 theory, the carbon basis set is in addition augmented

with diﬀuse functions [22]. All relevant data for the W2h calculation are collected in Table

I. Calculations using more approximate methods such as G3 theory [2] and CBS-QB3 [3]

were carried out using their respective implementations in Gaussian 98 [23].

For a molecule this size, the zero-point vibrational energy (ZPVE) is large enough that

even fairly small relative errors may compromise the quality of the ﬁnal TAE. Handy and

coworkers [24] computed a quartic force ﬁeld at the B3LYP/TZ2P [25,26] level; from their

published anharmonicity constants (in particular the set deperturbed for Fermi resonances

closer than 100 cm−1), we obtain an anharmonic ZPVE of 62.04 kcal/mol. At the same

level of theory, one-half the sum of the harmonics, Pi ωidi/2 (with di the degeneracy of

mode i) comes out 0.9 kcal/mol too high at 62.96 kcal/mol, while one-half the sum of the

3

fundamentals, Pi νidi/2, comes out 1 kcal/mol too low at 60.98 kcal/mol. The average of

both estimates, Pi (ωi + νi)di/4=61.97 kcal/mol, is only 0.07 kcal/mol below the true anhar-

monic value. From the best available computed harmonic frequencies, CCSD(T)/ANO4321

[27] and the best available experimental fundamentals [24], we obtain ZPVE=62.01 kcal/mol,

or, after correction for the diﬀerence at the B3LYP/TZ2P level between Pi (ωi + νi)di/4 and

the true anharmonic ZPVE, we ﬁnd a best-estimate ZPVE=62.08 kcal/mol.

Of the more approximate approaches used in various computational thermochemistry

methods, HF/6-31G* harmonic frequencies scaled by 0.8929 (as used in G2 and G3 theory [2])

yield 60.33 kcal/mol, or about 1.7 kcal/mol too low. The procedure used in the very recent

G3X and G3SX theories [28], B3LYP/6-31G(2df,p) scaled by 0.9854, however reproduces

the best estimate to within 0.1 kcal/mol. B3LYP/6-311G** harmonic frequencies scaled

by 0.99, as used in CBS-QB3 [3], yields 62.23 kcal/mol, in very good agreement with the

best estimate; the HF/6-31G(d) scaled by 0.9184 estimate in CBS-Q yields 61.69 kcal/mol,

slightly too low. Finally, B3LYP/cc-pVTZ harmonics scaled by 0.985 (as used in W1 and

W1h theory [9]) yield 62.04 kcal/mol, in near-perfect agreement with the best estimate.

Relevant data for the W2h calculation are collected in Table I. At ﬁrst sight, the dis-

agreement between the W2h ∆H ◦

f,0K=23.1 kcal/mol and the experimental value of 24.0±0.2

kcal/mol seems disheartening for such a CPU-intensive calculation. (Note that it ‘errs’ on

the far side of the most recent previous benchmark calculation [5], 24.7±0.3 kcal/mol, which

used similar-sized basis sets as W1 theory.) However, the comparison with experiment is not

entirely ‘fair’ since it neglects the experimental uncertainties in the atomic heats of formation

required to convert an atomization energy into a heat of formation (or vice versa). Combining

these with the experimental ∆H ◦

f,0K leads to an experimentally derived TAE0=1305.7±0.7

kcal/mol, where the uncertainty is dominated by six times that in the heat of vaporization

of graphite. In other words, our calculated TAE0=1306.8 kcal/mol is only 0.2 kcal/mol re-

moved from the upper end of the experimental uncertainty interval. (After all, an error of

0.02% seems to be a bit much to ask for.)

Alternatively and equivalently, one could aﬃx an uncertainty of ±0.7 kcal/mol to the

4

computed W2h ∆H ◦

f,0K=23.1±0.7 kcal/mol, where the error bar only reﬂects the uncer-

tainties in the auxiliary experimental data (i.e. the heats of atomization of the elements),

but does not include the uncertainty in the theoretical calculation itself which is harder to

quantify. While most chemists would prefer the heat of formation, an analysis in terms of

atomization energies is somewhat more elegant since it avoids mixing computed and observed

data. (Unfortunately, a benchmark ab initio heat of vaporization of graphite does not appear

to be feasible at this point in time.)

Secondly, let us consider the ‘gaps’ bridged by the extrapolations. For the SCF compo-

nent, that is a very reasonable 0.3 kcal/mol (0.03 %), but for the CCSD valence correlation

component this rises to 5 kcal/mol (1.7 %) while for the connected triple excitations con-

tribution it amounts to 1 kcal/mol (3.7 % — note however that a smaller basis set is being

used than for CCSD). It is clear that the extrapolations are indispensable to obtain even a

useful result, let alone an accurate one, even with such large basis sets.

Inner-shell correlation, at 7 kcal/mol, is of quite nontrivial importance, but even scalar

relativistic eﬀects (at −1.0 kcal/mol) cannot be ignored. (The discrepancy between our scalar

relativistic correction and the previous SCF-level calculation of Kedziora et al. [29], −1.27

kcal/mol, is consistent with the known tendency [9,30,31] of SCF-level scalar relativistic

corrections to be overestimated by 20–25%.) And manifestly, even a 2% error in a 62

kcal/mol zero-point vibrational energy would be unacceptable.

Let us now consider the more approximate results. While W1h coincidentally agrees to

better than 0.2 kcal/mol with the W2h result, W1 deviates from the latter by 0.6 kcal/mol.

Note however that in W1h theory, the extrapolations bridge gaps of 0.8 (SCF), 10.1 (CCSD),

and 2.1 (T) kcal/mol, the corresponding amounts for W1 theory being 0.7, 9.1, and 1.9

kcal/mol, respectively. Common sense suggests that if extrapolations account for 13.0 (W1h)

and 11.7 (W1) kcal/mol, then a discrepancy of 1 kcal/mol should not come as a surprise —

in fact, the relatively good agreement between the two sets of numbers and the more rigorous

W2h result (total extrapolation: 6.3 kcal/mol) testiﬁes, if anything, to the robustness of the

method.

5

As for the diﬀerence of about 0.4 kcal/mol between the old-style [9] and new-style [10]

SCF extrapolations in W1h and W1 theories, comparison with the W2h SCF limits clearly

conﬁrms the new-style extrapolation to be the more reliable one. (The two extrapolations

yield basically the same result in W2h.) This should not be seen as an indication that the

E∞ + A/L5 formula is somehow better founded theoretically, but rather as an example of

why reliance on (aug-)cc-pVDZ data should be avoided if at all possible.

Our best TAE0 value (W2h) diﬀers by 1.6 kcal/mol from the previous benchmark calcu-

lation of Feller and Dixon [5]. In fact, since their largest basis set is of AVQZ quality, the

appropriate comparison would be with our W1 atomization energy, which is 2.3 kcal/mol

larger than their result using RCCSD(T) atomic energies. The zero-point energy and the

corrections for core correlation, scalar relativistic eﬀects, and atomic spin-orbit splitting are

all very similar in the two studies. Their extrapolation approach is very diﬀerent from ours,

but in the event this diﬀerence nearly cancels out with that caused by the diﬀerent deﬁnitions

of the RCCSD(T) energy used in the atomic calculations. (Feller and Dixon followed Ref.

[32], as opposed to Ref. [15] in the present paper: we ﬁnd the diﬀerence for six carbon atoms

to be 0.52 kcal/mol at the CCSD(T)/AVQZ level.) The diﬀerence is in fact mostly due to a

−2.1 kcal/mol correction for ‘higher-order correlation eﬀects’ applied in Ref. [5], which is an

estimate of the CCSDT − CCSD(T) diﬀerence from small basis set calculations. However,

the generally excellent quality of CCSD(T) computed bond energies rests to a large extent on

an error compensation between neglect of higher-order connected triple excitations (which

tend to reduce the binding energy) and complete neglect of quadruple excitations (which

tend to increase it) [33]. It has been known for some time (e.g. [34]) that CCSDT energies

are not necessarily closer to full CI than CCSD(T). Consequently, an accurate treatment

should either include both T4 and higher-order T3 eﬀects where it is possible to do so, or

neglect both:

including only the higher-order T3 of necessity leads to an underestimate of

TAE. We do note that our respective best estimates bracket the experimental value, which

may indicate that the ‘true’ (full CI) TAE lies in between. However, in view of the uncer-

tainty on the experimental TAE and the impossibility to carry out even a highly approximate

6

CCSDTQ calculation on benzene, it is hard to make a deﬁnite statement about this.

Turning ﬁnally to the more approximate approaches, G2 theory clearly underestimates

TAE0: G3 represents a major improvement, but the better than 1 kcal/mol agreement

between the G3 TAE0 and the experimentally derived value in fact beneﬁts from an error

compensation with the underestimated ZPVE: a rather more pronounced diﬀerence is seen

for TAEe. This problem is remedied in the very recent G3X and G3SX theories, which

predict both TAEe and TAE0 to within 1 kcal/mol of experiment, as does CBS-QB3. CBS-

Q is slightly too low; the fairly elaborate CBS-APNO method [35] ﬁnd results that nearly

coincide with W1 theory.

(We note that none of the Gn and CBS methods considered

explicitly includes scalar relativistic eﬀects; they instead rely on them being absorbed into

the parametrization.)

Summarizing the above, we may state the following:

The total atomization energy of benzene, C6H6, was computed fully ab initio by means

of W2h theory as 1306.6 kcal/mol, to be compared with the experimentally derived value

1305.7±0.7 kcal/mol. The computed result includes contributions from inner-shell corre-

lation (7.1 kcal/mol), scalar relativistic eﬀects (-1.0 kcal/mol), atomic spin-orbit splitting

(-0.5 kcal/mol), and the anharmonic zero-point vibrational energy (62.1 kcal/mol). The

largest-scale calculations involved are CCSD/cc-pV5Z and CCSD(T)/cc-pVQZ; basis set ex-

trapolations account for 6.3 kcal/mol of the ﬁnal result. Performance of more approximate

methods has been analyzed. Our results suggest that, even for systems the size of benzene,

chemically accurate molecular atomization energies can be obtained from fully ﬁrst-principles

calculations, without resorting to corrections or parameters derived from experiment.

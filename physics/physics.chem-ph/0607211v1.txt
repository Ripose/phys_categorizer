Abstract

The cross-over from coherent to incoherent exciton transport in disordered polymer ﬁlms is

studied by computationally solving a modiﬁed form of the Redﬁeld equation for the exciton density

matrix. This theory models quantum mechanical (ballistic) and incoherent (diﬀusive) transport

as limiting cases. It also reproduces F¨orster transport for certain parameter regimes. Using model

parameters appropriate to polymer thin ﬁlms it is shown that short-time quantum mechanical

coherence increases the exciton diﬀusion length. It also causes rapid initial energy relaxation and

larger line widths. The route to equilibrium is, however, more questionable, as the equilibrium

populations of the model do not satisfy the Boltzmann distributions over the site energies. The

Redﬁeld equation for the dimer is solved exactly to provide insight into the numerical results.

INTRODUCTION

Energy transport via exciton migration in disordered organic semiconducting solids has

been extensively investigated by theoretical and computational modelling1,2,3,4,5. It is gen-

erally assumed that the dephasing rates in these systems are large compared to the exciton

transfer rates, so that the quantum mechanical phase memory of the exciton is rapidly

lost, rendering the exciton motion incoherent. The eﬀective medium approximation was

developed by Movaghar and co-workers1,3 in the incoherent limit to investigate the role of

spatial and energetic disorder on charge and energy transport properties. This mean-ﬁeld

theory agrees remarkably well with Monte Carlo simulations at high enough temperatures,

predicting a roughly

log(t) time dependence for the energy relaxation. At low tempera-

tures, however, mean-ﬁeld theory overestimates the relaxation pathways4, and thus fails to

−

predict the ‘freezing-in’ of the energy relaxation observed both experimentally and in Monte

Carlo simulations. For a Gaussian distribution of energetic disorder the pseudo-equilibrium

diﬀusion coeﬃcient, D(T ), is found to behave as,

D(T ) = D0 exp(

(T0/T )2)

−

(1)

at high temperatures (where T0 is proportional to the width of the Gaussian distribution),

while at low temperatures it is exponentially activated1.

Conversely, it is generally assumed that dephasing rates in biological light harvesting

complexes are generally small enough that the exciton motion remains coherent for times

long enough for the exciton to successfully reach the reaction center before it can radiatively

recombine. Indeed, in light harvesting complexes the ballistic nature of exciton transport

coupled to an energy landscape that ‘funnels’ the exciton to the reaction center leads to

particularly eﬃcient energy transport.6,7 In a disordered energy landscape with suﬃciently

large energetic disorder, on the other hand, localization occurs in the coherent regime8.

Dephasing rates in typical organic compounds are signiﬁcantly enhanced by intra and

inter molecular disorder that scatters the exciton wavefunction9. Thus, typical dephasing

times are roughly 1 ps in an ordered conjugated polymer chain10, compared to roughly 100 fs

in a disordered system11. Nonetheless, the advent of ultra-fast spectroscopy allows relaxation

phenomena occurring on sub-100 fs time-scales to be observed, implying that theoretical

modelling of exciton transport should also take into account quantum coherence eﬀects on

these time-scales. Indeed, more recent Monte Carlo simulations of exciton transport in the

2

incoherent limit fail to predict the observed very fast relaxation processes that lead to a

rapid reduction of the average energy and a broadening of the spectral lines5. Although this

rapid energy reduction was attributed to vibrational relaxation5, as will be demonstrated

in this paper, another possible mechanism is coherent energy transport. The ‘anomalous’

red-shifted emission also emphasizes the role of quantum coherence on exciton dynamics,

as this has been attributed to the recombination of an exciton delocalized over a pair of

polymer chains5.

As for light harvesting complexes, the successful operation of a polymer photovoltaic

device requires that a photo-excited exciton migrates to a polymer heterojunction and then

disassociates before it can recombine. An understanding of the role of quantum coherence

and energetic disorder on exciton transport is therefore essential if realistic simulations of

device properties are to be performed.

This paper presents computational studies of the cross-over from coherent to incoherent

exciton transport. The model that we adopt assumes a localized basis whereby an exciton

initially created on a chromophore migrates to neighboring chromophores. This model re-

tains the properties of fully coherent and fully incoherent transport as limiting cases. In

particular, for short times the quantum mechanical processes lead to a coherent wavepacket

that is delocalized over more than one chromophore. At long times dephasing processes de-

stroy phase coherence, and the motion becomes ‘classical’. F¨orster-like dipole-dipole induced

exciton transport is described by a limiting case of this model. We show that short-time

coherent motion leads to increased exciton diﬀusion lengths, and to initial rapid energy

relaxation and increased line widths.

The plan of this paper is as follows. The next section outlines the model, while Section

III describes the numerical techniques to solve it. Section IV describes and discusses our

results, and we conclude in Section V.

II. THE MODEL

Exciton transfer from chromophore m to chromophore n, mediated by the dipole-dipole

interaction, is parameterized by the energy transfer integral, J ′

mn. Assuming that each

chromophore exists either in its ground state or a single excited state, and that the excitation

energy of the mth chromophore is ǫm, the Hamiltonian that describes the coherent exciton

will cause a loss of phase coherence. This behavior is conveniently modelled by an equation

In a localized exciton basis the matrix elements of the reduced density operator are

rived by performing the trace in Eq. (3)12.

In this paper, however, we assume a semi-

phenomenological approach and adopt a Redﬁeld-like equation that describes coherent and

incoherent processes as limiting cases, and in general models the cross-over from short-time

coherent behavior to long-time incoherent behavior. This model is deﬁned as follows by

decomposing the equation of motion for the matrix elements into its constituent parts:

from the dipole-dipole coupling. This result reﬂects the fact that Eq. (4) approximates to

the diﬀusion equation in the long-time limit13. Thus, in this model in the long-time limit

the dipole-dipole interaction contributes to incoherent motion in two ways. First, explicitly

from L2ρmn (where k formally is proportional to the spatial derivative of Jmn

12) and second,

implicitly from the F¨orster mechanism.

It is immediately apparent from Eq. (13) that for short times (but for t > k/J 2) the exciton

transport is dominated by coherent, ballistic processes, and therefore the exciton travels

much further than it would if only incoherent, diﬀusive processes are considered.

Finally, the fully quantum mechanical behavior of Eq. (9) is also reproduced from Eq.

the equilibrium populations are not determined by the Boltzmann distribution over the site

energies when the rates satisfy Eq. (11). To our knowledge no analytical results exist for

the transport properties associated with Eq. (4) in a general disordered energy landscape.

The numerical techniques to solve this model are therefore described in the next section.

The evaluation of Eq. (19) requires a diagonalization of the M

M sparse, complex, and

non-hermitian transformation matrix, A. For most problems of interest this matrix is far

too large to numerically diagonalize completely. However, the real parts of the eigenvalues

of A are the rates for the decay of the eigenmodes. Consequently, for times greater than

an arbitrary cut-oﬀ, τ , only eigenvalues whose real parts satisfy

< τ −1 need to be

computed. If only this long-time behavior is required, it is only necessary to diagonalize A

for a small sub-set of the entire spectrum using sparse-matrix diagonalization techniques20.

This approach is further described in Appendix B. The long-time behavior can then be

matched to the short-time behavior obtained by standard numerical integration techniques,

as described below.

In practice, the equation of motion for the density matrix, Eq. (4), may be solved more

eﬃciently for large systems by standard numerical time-discretization techniques. To ensure

both stability and accuracy the Crank-Nicolson scheme – an average of implicit and explicit

forward-time-centered-space discretization methods – is employed15,16. In order to adapt the

Crank-Nicolson scheme for Eq. (4) it is necessary to adopt the Operator Splitting Method17

by decomposing the spatial diﬀerential operator on the right-hand-side of Eq. (4) into a sum

of zero or one-dimensional operators.

IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

For an Nsite site lattice the number of matrix elements (or components) of Eq. (4) is N 2

site,

rendering this a computationally very expensive problem. To obtain numerical results from

time-scales of 10−15 to 10−9 seconds it has therefore been necessary to restrict the size and

dimensionality of the lattice. In this paper we describe results for two-dimensional square

lattices of up to 41

41 sites.

Our parametrization of the model follows closely that of Meskers et al.5. We take nearest

neighbor interactions on a square lattice, with k = 0.00088 eV (

(5 ps)−1), τ0 = 300
(200 fs)−1), while J (which models the strength of the quantum

coherence) is an independent parameter, varying from 0.02 eV to 0.00414 eV (

≡

The value of J = 0.00414 eV corresponds to a F¨orster transfer rate of J 2/γ0 = 0.00088

eV, so in the limit that k = 0 and long times the model maps directly onto the Mesker

parametrization. The energetic disorder is modelled by a Gaussian distribution function19

of mean energy, ¯ǫ = 3.0 eV and σ = 0.07 eV. We perform averages over ensembles of ﬁve

realizations of the disorder. The system is initially excited at the origin at t = 0 with an

energy of 3.1 eV.

A. Root-mean-square distance

We ﬁrst investigate the role of quantum coherence on the root-mean-square distance,

r2(t)

1/2, travelled by the exciton at a time t. Fig. 1 shows

r2

1/2 for various values of J.

time, τ0 = 300 ps. In contrast, in the classical limit (J = 0) the exciton has only travelled

ca. 4 lattice units in this time.

We next discuss the role of energetic disorder on the root-mean-square distance. As

Eq. (1) indicates, in the incoherent limit the scaled pseudo-equilibrium constant, D/D0,

is a function of disorder (and temperature) only. In contrast, for purely coherent motion

diﬀusion is related to both the exciton band width and the scale of the disorder, and indeed

localization occurs for suﬃciently larger disorder8. Eq. (13) indicates that

function of γ and k/J 2

expected, disorder reduces the value of

r2

1/2. Rather unexpectedly the scaled root-mean-

square distance increases with decreasing J. This is an artefact, however, of the fact that

disorder is more eﬀective at hindering transport when quasi-equilibrium is reached, which

takes longer to achieve for smaller values of J. A full analysis of the scaling of diﬀusion with

disorder requires further more extensive numerical calculations and analytical studies.

B. Energy relaxation

The expectation value of the energy as a function of time is obtained via Eq. (20) with
ˆH, and ˆH given by Eq. (2). As shown in Fig. 3, the initial rate of energy relaxation
ˆO
increases as J increases. By 10−12 s the energy has relaxed by 0.1 eV when J = 0.02 eV and

≡

by 0.05 eV in the classical limit (J = 0). This result can be understood by the observation

that in the coherent regime the exciton initially forms a wavepacket that travels ballistically,

and hence rapidly samples a wide ensemble of sites.

fact that for this model with a disordered energy landscape the equilibrium values of the

coherences (i.e. the oﬀ-diagonal density matrix elements) are not identically zero. Thus,

because of quantum mechanical delocalization, the probability for occupying a high energy

site is higher than that predicted by the Boltzmann distribution. This increase in the poten-

tial energy caused by the delocalization onto higher energy sites is not entirely compensated

by the kinetic energy reduction arising from the quantum mechanical delocalization. A full

treatment of a dimer with unequal energies is given in Appendix A to further illustrate this

point.

The successful operation of a polymer photovoltaic device requires that a photo-excited

exciton travels to a polymer heterojunction and then disassociates before it can recombine.

However, exciton transport in molecular systems is strongly dependent on molecular order,

as this both determines the exciton dephasing times and the energy landscape through which

the exciton travels.

This paper describes numerical solutions of a modiﬁed Redﬁeld equation for the exciton

reduced density matrix in order to study the role of quantum mechanical coherence and

energetic disorder both on the exciton diﬀusion length and its energetic relaxation. Using

model parameters appropriate to polymer thin ﬁlms, we showed that increased quantum co-

herence (achieved by increasing the exciton band width) leads to increased exciton diﬀusion

lengths. It also leads to initially more rapid energy relaxation and to wider line widths, in

qualitative agreement with experiment5. Quite generally, increased disorder implies shorter

migrate successfully to a polymer heterojunction.

Although the model is appropriate for the short-time transport and energy relaxation

processes, its applicability for describing the long-time route to equilibrium is more ques-

tionable. In particular, we showed that the particular assumption of Eq. (11) for the rates

for population transfer do not in equilibrium reproduce the Boltzmann distribution over the

site energies of Eq. (2). (This result was proved for the special case of the dimer.) The

cause of this discrepancy is the choice of basis for the exciton transport. As described in

ref12, taking as a basis the exciton eigenstates of Eq. (2) would give equilibrium described by

the Boltzmann distribution over these eigenstates. Unfortunately, however, this prescription

does not correspond to the physically intuitive picture of local exciton transfer from site to

site (and consequently does not reproduce F¨orster transfer as a limiting case).

Further work will include simulations over larger lattices in three dimensions and the

possible development of a mean ﬁeld theory in order to understand the relations between

disorder and quasi-equilibrium diﬀusion.

Notice that the real components of the coherences are identically zero. Also, for under-

components of the coherences decay to zero on a time-scale of (k + γ0)−1.

equilibrium value exceeds the classical value. Quantum mechanical delocalization onto the

higher energy site increases the average energy, because P1 is larger than its Boltzmann value,

thus raising the potential energy. This increase in potential energy is partially compensated

by a reduction in the kinetic energy arising from the last term in Eq. (A26). Fig. 6 also

APPENDIX B: SOLUTION OF THE EQUATION OF MOTION OF THE DEN-

SITY MATRIX BY LINEAR ALGEBRA TECHNIQUES

As described in Section III, for times greater than τ the dynamics of the density matrix is

determined by eigenmodes of A whose eigenvalues satisfy

< τ −1. If only this long-time

λi|

ℜ|

behavior is required it is only necessary to diagonalize A for a small sub-set of the entire

spectrum using sparse-matrix diagonalization techniques20. Fig. 7 shows
λi|
ℜ|

corresponding to eigenmodes decaying over timescales of t > 4.34

25 sites for J = 0.00414 eV. The ﬁrst 100 eigenvalues satisfy

×

Since A is non-hermitian, the inverse of S (where the columns of S are the eigenvectors

of A) is not equal to its adjoint, and thus its inverse must be calculated explicitly. However,

if only N out of the total of M eigenvalues and eigenfunctions have been computed, S is a

M

N matrix, and the matrix equation,

is over-determined. Its solution is determined by,

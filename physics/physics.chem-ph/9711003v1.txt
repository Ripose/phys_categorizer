The electronic structure of the hydrogen molecule in a magnetic ﬁeld is investigated for parallel
internuclear and magnetic ﬁeld axes. The lowest states of the Π manifold are studied for spin singlet
and triplet(Ms = −1) as well as gerade and ungerade parity for a broad range of ﬁeld strengths
0 ≤ B ≤ 100 a.u. For both states with gerade parity we observe a monotonous decrease in the
dissociation energy with increasing ﬁeld strength up to B = 0.1 a.u. and metastable states with
respect to the dissociation into two H atoms occur for a certain range of ﬁeld strengths. For both
states with ungerade parity we observe a strong increase in the dissociation energy with increasing
ﬁeld strength above some critical ﬁeld strength Bc. As a major result we determine the transition
ﬁeld strengths for the crossings among the lowest 1Σg, 3Σu and 3Πu states. The global ground
∼ 0.18 a.u. is the strongly bound 1Σg state. The crossings of the 1Σg with the 3Σu and
state for B <
3Πu state occur at B ≈ 0.18 and B ≈ 0.39 a.u., respectively. The transition between the 3Σu and
3Πu state occurs at B ≈ 12.3 a.u. Therefore, the global ground state of the hydrogen molecule for
the parallel conﬁguration is the unbound 3Σu state for 0.18 <
∼ 12.3 a.u. The ground state for
∼ 12.3 a.u. is the strongly bound 3Πu state. This result is of great relevance to the chemistry in

I. INTRODUCTION

The behavior and structure of matter in the presence of strong external magnetic ﬁelds is a research area of
increasing interest. This increasing interest is motivated by the occurence of strong ﬁelds and strong ﬁeld eﬀects in
diﬀerent branches of physics like astrophysics [1–3], atomic and molecular physics of Rydberg states [4] and certain
areas of solid state physics like excitons and/or quantum nano structures [5].

A number of theoretical investigations were performed concerning the properties of atomic and molecular systems in
strong magnetic ﬁelds. Most of them however deal with the hydrogen atom. For molecular systems only the electronic
structure of the H +
2 ion was investigated in some detail (see Refs. [6–10] and references therein). Very interesting
phenomena can be observed already for this simple diatomic system. For the ground state of the H +
2 molecule the
dissociation energy increases and the equilibrium internuclear distance simultaneously decreases with increasing ﬁeld
strength. Furthermore it was shown [11, 12] that a certain class of excited electronic states, which possess a purely
repulsive potential energy surface in the absence of a magnetic ﬁeld, acquire a well-pronounced potential well in
a suﬃciently strong magnetic ﬁeld. Moreover the electronic potential energies depend not only on the internuclear
distance but also on the angle between the magnetic ﬁeld and molecular axes which leads to a very complex topological
behavior of the corresponding potential energy surfaces [7–9].

In contrast to the H +

2 ion there exist only a few investigations dealing with the electronic structure of the hydrogen
molecule in the presence of a strong magnetic ﬁeld. Highly excited states of H2 were studied for a ﬁeld strength of
4.7 T in Ref. [13]. For intermediate ﬁeld strengths two studies of almost qualitative character investigate the potential
energy curve (PEC) of the lowest 1Σg state [14,15]. A few investigations were performed in the high ﬁeld limit [16–19],
where the magnetic forces dominate over the Coulomb forces and therefore several approximations can be performed.
Very recently a ﬁrst step has been done in order to elucidate the electronic structure of the H2 molecule for the parallel
conﬁguration, i.e. for parallel internuclear and magnetic ﬁeld axes [20]. In that investigation the ground states of the
Σ manifold were studied for gerade and ungerade parity as well as singlet and triplet states. Hereby accurate adiabatic
electronic energies were obtained for a broad range of ﬁeld strengths from ﬁeld free space up to strong magnetic ﬁelds
of 100 a.u. A variety of interesting eﬀects were revealed. As in the case of the H +
2 ion, the lowest strongly bound
states, i.e. the lowest 1Σg , 3Σg and 1Σu state, show a decrease of the bond length and an increase in the dissociation
energy for suﬃciently strong ﬁelds. Furthermore a change in the dissociation channel occurs for the lowest 1Σu state
between B = 10.0 and 20.0 a.u. due to the existence of strongly bound H − states in the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld.
The 3Σg state was shown to exhibit an additional outer minimum for intermediate ﬁeld strengths which could provide
vibrationally bound states.

1

An important result of Ref. [20] is the change of the ground state from the lowest 1Σg state to the lowest 3Σu state
between B = 0.1 and 0.2 a.u. This crossing is of particular relevance for the existence of molecular hydrogen in the
vicinity of white dwarfs. The 3Σu state is an unbound state and possesses only a very shallow van der Waals minimum
which does not provide any vibrational level. Therefore, the ground state of the hydrogen molecule for the parallel
conﬁguration is an unbound state for B >
∼ 0.2 a.u. up to some much higher critical ﬁeld strength Bc which is not
known exactly. In Ref. [18] it has been shown that for very strong ﬁelds (B >
∼ 3 × 103 a.u.) the strongly bound 3Πu
state is the global ground state of the hydrogen molecule oriented parallel to the magnetic ﬁeld. Therefore a second
transition which involves the unbound 3Σu and the strongly bound 3Πu state has to occur at some ﬁeld strength
between 0.2 and 3 × 103 a.u.

The above considerations show that detailed studies of the electronic properties of the hydrogen molecule in a
magnetic ﬁeld are very desirable. The present investigation deals with the electronic structure of the lowest states of
the important Π subspace, i.e. the lowest singlet and triplet(Ms = −1) states with gerade and ungerade parity. This
subspace contains, as mentioned above, the global ground state of the H2 molecule for suﬃciently strong magnetic
ﬁelds. We hereby consider the case of parallel internuclear and magnetic ﬁeld axes. The parallel conﬁguration is
distinct by its high symmetry compared to the case of an arbitrary angle between the internuclear and magnetic
ﬁeld axes and is expected to play an important role for the electronic structure of the hydrogen molecule [21]. The
results of our calculations include accurate adiabatic PECs for the complete range of ﬁeld strengths 0 ≤ B ≤ 100 a.u.
We present detailed data for the total and dissociation energies, equilibrium internuclear distances and positions of
maxima for the corresponding electronic states. Moreover we provide a discussion of the global ground state of the
parallel conﬁguration and give the transition ﬁeld strengths for the crossings between the 1Σg , 3Σu and 3Πu states.
In detail the paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II we describe the theoretical aspects of the present investigation,
including a discussion of the Hamiltonian and a description of the basis set of our CI calculations. In Sec. III we
discuss the general aspects of the potential energy curves (PECs) in ﬁeld free space for the lowest states of the Π
subspace. Sec. IV contains a detailed investigation of the electronic structure of the lowest Π states in the presence of
a magnetic ﬁeld for the range 0.001 ≤ B ≤ 100 a.u. Finally the global ground state of the hydrogen molecule oriented
parallel to the magnetic ﬁeld is studied in Sec. V. The summary and conclusions are given in Sec. VI.

II. THEORETICAL ASPECTS

Our starting point is the total nonrelativistic molecular Hamiltonian in Cartesian coordinates. The total pseu-
domomentum is a constant of motion and therefore commutes with the Hamiltonian [22, 23]. For that reason the
Hamiltonian can be simpliﬁed by performing a so-called pseudoseparation of the center of mass motion [22, 24, 25]
which introduces the center of mass coordinate and the conserved pseudomomentum as a pair of canonical conjugated
variables. Further simpliﬁcations can be achieved by a consecutive series of unitary transformations [24, 25].

In order to separate the electronic and nuclear motion we perform the Born-Oppenheimer approximation in the
presence of a magnetic ﬁeld [24–26]. As a ﬁrst order approximation we assume inﬁnitely heavy masses for the nuclei.
The origin of our coordinate system coincides with the midpoint of the internuclear axis of the hydrogen molecule
and the protons are located on the z axis. The magnetic ﬁeld is chosen parallel to the z axis of our coordinate system
and the symmetric gauge is adopted for the vector potential. The gyromagnetic factor of the electron is chosen to be
equal to two. The Hamiltonian, therefore, takes on the following appearance:

The symbols ri, pi and Li denote the position vectors, the canonical conjugated momenta and the angular momenta
of the two electrons, respectively. B and R are the vectors of the magnetic ﬁeld and internuclear distance, respectively
and R denotes the magnitude of R. With S we denote the vector of the total electronic spin. Throughout the paper
we will use atomic units.

The Hamiltonian (1) commutes with the following operators: the parity operator P , the projection Lz of the
electronic angular momentum on the internuclear axis, the square S2 of the total electronic spin and the projection
Sz of the total electronic spin on the internuclear axis. In the case of ﬁeld free space we encounter an additional
independent symmetry namely the reﬂections of the electronic coordinates at the xz (σv) plane. The eigenfunctions
possess the corresponding eigenvalues ±1. This symmetry does not hold in the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld! Therefore,
the resulting symmetry groups for the hydrogen molecule are D∞h in the case of ﬁeld free space and C∞h in the
presence of a magnetic ﬁeld [21].

In order to solve the ﬁxed-nuclei electronic Schr¨odinger equation belonging to the Hamiltonian (1) we expand the
electronic eigenfunctions in terms of molecular conﬁgurations. In a ﬁrst step the total electronic wave function Ψges

2

is written as a product of its spatial part Ψ and its spin part χ, i.e. we have Ψges = Ψχ. For the spatial part Ψ of the
wave function we use the LCAO-MO-ansatz, i.e. we decompose Ψ with respect to molecular orbital conﬁgurations ψ
of H2, which respect the corresponding symmetries (see above) and the Pauli principle:

Ψ =

cij [ψij (r1, r2) ± ψij (r2, r1)]

=

cij [Φi (r1) Φj (r2) ± Φi (r2) Φj (r1)]

Xi,j

The molecular orbital conﬁgurations ψij of H2 are products of the corresponding one-electron H +
2 molecular orbitals
Φi and Φj. The H +
2 molecular orbitals are built from atomic orbitals centered at each nucleus. A key ingredient
of this procedure is a basis set of nonorthogonal optimized nonspherical Gaussian atomic orbitals which has been
established previously [27,28]. For the case of a H2−molecule parallel to the magnetic ﬁeld these basis functions read
as follows:

The symbols ρ = x2 + y2 and z denote the electronic coordinates. m, k and l are parameter depending on the
subspace of the H-atom for which the basis functions have been optimized and α and β are variational parameters.
For a more detailed description of the construction of the molecular electronic wave function we refer the reader to
Ref. [20].

In order to determine the molecular electronic wave function of H2 we use the variational principle which means

that we minimize the variational integral

by varying the coeﬃcients ci. The resulting generalized eigenvalue

problem reads as follows:

Ψ∗HΨ
Ψ∗Ψ

R
R

(H − ǫS) c = 0

(3)

where the Hamiltonian matrix H is real and symmetric and the overlap matrix is real, symmetric and positiv deﬁnite.
The vector c contains the expansion coeﬃcients. The matrix elements of the Hamiltonian matrix and the overlap
matrix are certain combinations of matrix elements with respect to the optimized nonspherical Gaussian atomic
orbitals. A description of the technique of the evaluation of these matrix elements is given in Ref. [20].

For the numerical solution of the eigenvalue problem (3) we used the standard NAG library. The positions, i.e.
internuclear distances, of the maxima and the minima in the PECs were determined with an accuracy of 10−2a.u.
Herefore about 350 points were calculated on an average for each PEC. The typical dimension of the Hamiltonian
matrix for each Π subspace varies between approximately 1700 and 3300 depending on the magnetic ﬁeld strength.
The overall accuracy of our results in the energy is estimated to be typically better than 10−4 and for some cases
better than 10−4. Depending on the dimension of the Hamiltonian matrix, is takes between 70 and 250 minutes for
simultaneously calculating one point of a PEC of each Π− subspace on a IBM RS6000 computer.

III. THE GROUND STATES OF THE Π−MANIFOLD IN FIELD FREE SPACE

Let us start with the discussion of the general properties of the low lying Π states in ﬁeld free space whose PECs
are given in Fig. 1. A detailed description of these states can be found in Ref. [29]. At large internuclear distances
both the lowest 1Πg as well as the 3Πg state can be approximately described by a Heitler-London type wave function
consisting of the orbital conﬁguration (1s2pπ)g. An avoided crossing with the attractive (1σg3dπ) type state leads
to the occurence of a minimum in both of the Πg PECs (see Fig. 1). For the singlet 1Πg state we encounter a
second minimum of van der Waals type at large internuclear distances which has been shown to accomodate several
vibrational levels within the Born-Oppenheimer approximation [30]. The united atom limit for the 1Πg and 3Πg state
is the 1D 1s3d and 3D 1s3d helium state, respectively. A remarkable feature of the 1Πg and 3Πg state is the fact,
that their wave functions are almost indistinguishable for small internuclear distances, i.e. R <
∼ 2.5 a.u. (see also their
PECs in Fig. 1). For R <
∼ 2.3 a.u. the triplet state has a slightly lower energy than the singlet. The energy diﬀerence
between the singlet and triplet state at the equilibrium internuclear distance amounts to 4.92 × 10−5 a.u. and reaches
a maximum of 6.38 × 10−5 a.u. at R ≈ 1.6 a.u. With further decreasing internuclear distance the energy diﬀerence
decreases ﬁnally reaching a value of 1.55 × 10−5 a.u. in the united atom limit [30].

The Πu states whose PECs are also illustrated in Fig. 1 can be represented by a Heitler-London type wave
function (1s2pπ)u for large internuclear distances. Near the equilibrium internuclear distance the wave function can

3

approximately be described by a (1σg2pπ) type conﬁguration. The PEC of the 1Πu state exhibits a hump at R ≈ 9 a.u.
due to a ﬁrst order London dispersion force. For the 1Πu and 3Πu state the united atom limit is given by the 1P 1s2p
and 3P 1s2p helium state, respectively. An overall feature of the lowest Π states with ungerade parity is the fact that
the PEC of the 3Πu triplet state is lower in energy than the corresponding PEC of the 1Πu singlet state. Extensive
studies have been performed in order to explain the diﬀerence in the energy of the 1Πu and 3Πu states, i.e. the
singlet-triplet energy splitting. Intuitively one would expect the interelectronic repulsion being smaller for the triplet
state than for the singlet due to the zero of the wave function if the coordinates of both electrons are equal. However,
it has been shown that, similar to the case of the 1P and 3P states of helium, the interelectronic repulsion is larger
in the triplet state. The greater stability, i.e. lower energy, of the triplet state occurs due to a larger electron-nucleus
attraction energy [31]. With increasing internuclear distances both the PECs of the 1Πg and 3Πu state as well as
those of the 1Πu and 3Πg state approach each other and ﬁnally end up in the same separated atom limit which is
H (1s) + H (2p).

After describing the general aspects of the PECs for the lowest states of the four Π subspaces let us compare our
numerical results for these states with the existing data in the literature. For the 1Πg state very accurate energies
within the Born-Oppenheimer approximation were obtained by Wolniewicz [32] and Kolos and Rychlewski [30]. For the
equilibrium internuclear distance R = 2.01 a.u. we obtained a total energy of −0.69501 a.u. which yields a dissociation
energy of 0.034502 a.u. (cf. Table I). This corresponds to a relative accuracy in the total energy of 3.2×10−5 compared
to the result in [32]. The relative accuracy of our data further improves with increasing internuclear distance. As an
example we mention R = 12 a.u. where the relative accuracy is 2.4 × 10−6. For the second minimum we obtained an
equilibrium internuclear distance of 8.14 a.u. with a total energy of −0.625803 a.u. The dissociation energy for this
minimum therefore amounts to 8.038 × 10−4 a.u. The maximum in the PEC with a total energy of −0.616547 a.u.
occurs at an internuclear distance of 4.24 a.u.

As a reference for the Born-Oppenheimer energies of the 1Πu state we use the data given in Ref. [33]. Results
of our calculations concerning the PEC of the 1Πu state are presented in Table III. At the equilibrium internuclear
distance Req = 1.95 a.u. our calculations yield a total energy of −0.718219 a.u. corresponding to a dissociation energy
of 0.093220 a.u. The relative accuracy compared to the data given in Ref. [33] is 2.4 × 10−4 at Req and 2.7 × 10−6 at
R = 12 a.u. As in the case of the 1Πg state the acccuracy of our calculations increases with increasing internuclear
distances. The position of the maximum has been determined to be Rmax = 9.03 a.u. and the total energy at Rmax
evaluates to −0.624528 a.u.

Accurate Born-Oppenheimer energies for the lowest triplet states can be found in Ref. [30]. Data of the present
investigation for the total energies and positions of maxima and minima are given in Table II for the 3Πg and Table IV
for the 3Πu state, respectively. Within our calculations the total energy of the 3Πg state at the equilibrium internuclear
distance R = 2.01 a.u. amounts to −0.659553 a.u. Therefore, the relative accuracy of the total energy compared to
the data given in Ref. [30] is 2.2 × 10−5. For the 3Πu state an equilibrium internuclear distance of R = 1.96 a.u. with
a total energy of −0.737521 a.u. has been obtained corresponding to a relative error of 6.3 × 10−5. For both states
the accuracy for larger internuclear distances is of the order of magnitude of 10−6.

IV. THE LOWEST Π−STATES IN THE PRESENCE OF A MAGNETIC FIELD

A. The 1Πg state

First of all we consider the dissociation channel of the 1Πg state in the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld. In our notation
atomic hydrogen states are labeled by H (mπa
a ), where ma is the atomic magnetic quantum number and πa the atomic
z parity. For the entire range of ﬁeld strengths 0 < B ≤ 100 a.u. the dissociation channel of the 1Πg state is given
by H2 → H (0+) + H (1+). This means that the energy in the dissociation limit corresponds to the total energy of
two hydrogen atoms in the lowest electronic state within the (0+) and (1+) subspace, respectively. This dissociation
channel holds also for all the other electronic Π states considered in the present work.

Let us now investigate the PEC of the 1Πg state with varying ﬁeld strength which is illustrated in Fig. 2a. For
the ﬁrst minimum/well we observe that the corresponding depth decreases strongly with increasing magnetic ﬁeld
strength. The dissociation energy, which amounts to Ed1 = 0.034502 a.u. in ﬁeld free space, monotonously decreases
to Ed1 = 0.014460 a.u. for B = 0.1 a.u. The corresponding equilibrium internuclear distance Req1 hereby remains
approximately constant up to a ﬁeld strength of B ≈ 0.01 a.u. With further increasing ﬁeld strength we observe a
minor increase to Req1 = 2.04 a.u. for B = 0.1 a.u. Between B = 0.1 and 0.5 a.u. we observe a drastical change in the
shape of the PEC. For a ﬁeld strength of 0.2 a.u. we encounter a metastable state with respect to the dissociation into
two hydrogen atoms. The minimum in the corresponding PEC occurs at an internuclear distance Req1 = 2.09 a.u. and
the diﬀerence between the total energies at Req1 and Rmax evaluates to Et1 − Emax = 0.011130 a.u. For even larger

4

ﬁeld strengths, i.e. B >
∼ 0.5 a.u., the ﬁrst minimum disappears. Simultaneously we observe a moderate change in the
position of the maximum Rmax in the regime 0 ≤ B <
∼ 0.2 a.u. With increasing magnetic ﬁeld strength Rmax is shifted
to decreasingly smaller internuclear distances, i.e. from Rmax = 4.24 a.u. in ﬁeld free space to Rmax = 3.28 a.u. for
a ﬁeld strength of 0.2 a.u. Fig. 2a shows the PECs of the 1Πg state for diﬀerent ﬁeld strengths illustrating the shape
of the PEC near the ﬁrst equilibrium internuclear distance. The corresponding data concerning the positions of the
maxima and minima, total and dissociation energies, and total energies in the separated atom limit are presented in
Table I.

Despite the fact that the ﬁrst minimum and the maximum of the PEC disappear for ﬁeld strengths B >

∼ 0.5 a.u.
the PECs possess some interesting features for larger ﬁeld strengths.
In the following discussion we focus on the
rough shape of the PECs shown in Fig. 2a for B >
∼ 0.5 a.u. From Fig. 2a we observe that the PEC of the 1Πg state
exhibits two turning points at R ≈ 2.3 a.u. and R ≈ 3.2 a.u. for the ﬁeld strength B = 0.5 a.u. For B = 1 a.u. these
two turning points are shifted to smaller internuclear distances, e.g. R ≈ 2.2 a.u. and R ≈ 2.4 a.u. From Fig. 2a we
see that these turning points are much less pronounced for a ﬁeld strength of B = 1 than for 0.5 a.u. which is also
conﬁrmed by an investigation of the corresponding ﬁrst derivatives of the above PECs. With further increasing ﬁeld
∼ 20 a.u., no turning points can be found in the PEC of the 1Πg state. Only for
strength, i.e.
ﬁeld strengths B >
∼ 50 a.u. two turning points again exists which however cannot be seen in the PEC for B = 100 a.u.
in Fig. 2a since they occur for very small values of the internuclear distance. This behavior is of importance for the
singlet-triplet energy splitting between the PECs of the 1Πg and 3Πg (Ms = 0) state which will be discussed in the
following subsection.

in the range 2 <

∼ B <

In addition to the deep minimum at Req1 = 2.01 a.u. in the PEC of the 1Πg state, a second minimum exists which
in ﬁeld free space is very shallow and located at Req2 = 8.14 a.u. The corresponding region of the PECs is illustrated
in Fig. 2b. In the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld this minimum becomes more and more pronounced with increasing
ﬁeld strength. The depth of the well monotonously increases up to a ﬁeld strength of B = 1 a.u. (c.f. Table I).
The dissociation energy Ed2 for B = 1 a.u. amounts to 2.853 × 10−3 which is more than three times as much as the
corresponding dissociation energy in ﬁeld free space. For ﬁeld strengths B >
∼ 2 a.u. the dissociation energy decreases
monotonously. The corresponding equilibrium internuclear distance Req2 for this second minimum ﬁrst decreases with
increasing ﬁeld strength from 8.14 a.u. in ﬁeld free space to 4.05 a.u. at B = 10 a.u. but exhibits a minor increase
for B >
∼ 20 a.u. with further increasing magnetic ﬁeld strength. From Fig. 2b we can also observe the monotonous
decrease in Req2 up to a ﬁeld strength of 10 a.u.

Next let us discuss the existence of bound states. Herefore we have to investigate whether vibrational levels exist in
the PECs discussed above. The determination of vibrational levels in the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld is a complicated
task since the Born-Oppenheimer approximation known from ﬁeld free space breaks down in the presence of a magnetic
ﬁeld: The nuclear charges are treated as ’naked’ charges which is an incomplete description since they are at least
partially screened by the electrons against the magnetic ﬁeld. In order to decribe this screening correctly, the diagonal
terms of the nonadiabatic coupling elements have to be included in the nuclear equation of motion [24, 25, 34]. The
screening of the nuclear charges depends not only on the internuclear distance but also on the angle between the
internuclear axis and the magnetic ﬁeld. As a consequence the nuclear equation of motion is much more complex
In the present investigation we are dealing
in the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld compared to the ﬁeld free space.
with the case of parallel internuclear and magnetic ﬁeld axes and therefore cannot determine the exact vibrational
levels. However we are able to provide estimations for the positions of the vibrational levels and on the basis of these
estimates we can decide whether bound states exist with respect to the vibrational mode R.

A lower estimate of the vibrational energy can be obtained by solving the nuclear equation of motion known
from ﬁeld free space P 2
2µ + V , where the potential V is given by the corresponding PEC in the magnetic ﬁeld. The
corresponding Schr¨odinger equation is then solved by using a discrete variable method [35]. An upper estimate for
the energy of a vibrational state is obtained by simply adding the Landau energy of the nuclear equation of motion
to the lower estimate of the energy level. Estimations concerning the existence of vibrational levels were performed
for each PEC shown in all ﬁgures. The number of vibrational levels with quantum number J = Λ = 0 in the ﬁrst well
of the PEC of the 1Πg state (see Fig. 2a) decreases monotonously with increasing ﬁeld strength up to B = 0.1 a.u.
Bound states exist in the entire range of ﬁeld strengths 0.0 ≤ B <
∼ 0.1 a.u. For the second, i.e. outer, well bound
states exist up to a ﬁeld strength of 2 a.u. In the range 5 <
∼ 50 a.u. the lower estimate of the vibrational energy
was found below the energy in the separated atom limit where the upper bound is above. Therefore, the existence of
bound states depends on the detailed nuclear motion and cannot be decided within the present approach. For even
larger magnetic ﬁelds (B >
∼ 100 a.u.) no vibrational states exists in the PEC of the 1Πg state.

∼ B <

B. The 3Πg state

The shape of the PEC of the 3Πg state depending on the magnetic ﬁeld strength is shown in Fig. 3 and the
corresponding data are given in Table II. With increasing ﬁeld strength the absolute value of the total energy in the
dissociation limit monotonously increases due to the spin-Zeeman shift in the magnetic ﬁeld. As in the case of the
1Πg state we observe a decrease in the dissociation energy with increasing ﬁeld strength from Ed = 0.034554 a.u. in
ﬁeld free space to Ed = 0.014550 a.u. for a ﬁeld strength of 0.1 a.u. For B = 0.2 and 0.5 a.u. we encounter metastable
states with respect to the dissociation into two hydrogen atoms. For these states, the diﬀerence of the total energy
of the maximum and the minimum of the corrresponding PEC instead of the dissociation energy is given in Table II.
The position of the equilibrium internuclear distance is shifted to slightly larger values with increasing ﬁeld strength,
i.e. from Req = 2.01 a.u. in ﬁeld free space to 2.15 a.u. for B = 0.5 a.u. Simultaneously the position of the maximum
Rmax decreases from 4.35 a.u. in ﬁeld free space to 2.76 a.u. for B = 0.5 a.u. For ﬁeld strengths B >
∼ 1 a.u. no maxima
or minima occur in the PEC of the 3Πg state . However, the PEC possesses two turning points for B ≥ 1 a.u. which
can be clearly seen in Fig. 3 for B = 1 and 2 a.u. The positions of these two turning points are shifted from 2.16
and 2.98 a.u. for B = 1 a.u. to 0.54 and 0.8 a.u. for B = 100 a.u. In contrast to the PECs of the 1Πg state , well
pronounced turning points exist for arbitrary ﬁeld strengths in the range 1 <

The above considerations indicate that the singlet-triplet energy splitting between the 1Πg state and 3Πg state for
Ms = 0 depends on the magnetic ﬁeld strength. To investigate this let us ﬁrst consider small internuclear distances,
i.e. the regime, for which the triplet state is lower in energy than the singlet. From Tables I and II we can see that the
singlet-triplet energy splitting does not vary strongly for 0 ≤ B ≤ 0.05 a.u. which is also conﬁrmed by the equality

Figs. 2a and 3 reveal an obvious diﬀerence for B = 0.5 a.u. where a metastable state occurs in the PEC of the
3Πg state which has no counterpart in the corresponding PEC of the 1Πg state. A careful look at Fig. 4 reveals
that for B <
∼ 0.2 a.u. the singlet-triplet splitting diﬀers not too much from the splitting in ﬁeld free space and both
PECs are therefore similar. With further increasing ﬁeld strength the maximum of the energy splitting is shifted to
smaller internuclear distances and becomes more and more pronounced. For a broad range of internuclear distances
Rc < R < ∞ the singlet state is lower in energy than the triplet state and the position of the minimum and turnover
in the singlet-triplet splitting decreases monotonously with increasing ﬁeld strength. The maximum absolute value of
the splitting shown in Fig. 4 occurs at a ﬁeld strength of 20 a.u.

Vibrational bound states for the PECs of the 3Πg state were found to exist for 0 ≤ B ≤ 0.1 a.u. As for the PEC of

(cid:1)

the 1Πg state the number of levels decreases with increasing ﬁeld strength.

C. The 1Πu state

The PEC of the 1Πu state exhibits a strongly pronounced potential well in ﬁeld free space whose minimum is
located at 1.95 a.u., and a maximum for large internuclear distances, i.e. at R = 9.03 a.u. For the entire range of ﬁeld
strengths 0 ≤ B ≤ 100 a.u. the minimum and maximum persist in the PEC of the 1Πu state . The corresponding
data, i.e. total and dissociation energies and equilibrium internuclear distances, are given in Table III and the PEC
is illustrated for diﬀerent ﬁeld strengths in Fig. 5. With increasing ﬁeld strength the dissociation energy Ed ﬁrst
decreases slightly for small values of B, i.e. from Ed = 0.093220 a.u. in ﬁeld free space to 0.087080 a.u. for B = 0.5 a.u.
Simultaneously the position of the equilibrium internuclear distance Req is shifted from 1.95 to 1.80 a.u. However,
the dissociation energy increases strongly with further increasing ﬁeld strength. At the same time the position of Req
is shifted to monotonously decreasing internuclear distances. As an example we mention the PEC of the 1Πu state
for B = 100 a.u. where the dissociation energy amounts to 1.208626 a.u. and the equilibrium internuclear distance
is 0.40 a.u. The PEC for of the 1Πu state for B = 100 a.u. is also shown in Fig. 5. In this ﬁgure we particularly
observe the strongly increasing dissociation energy for large values of B. For the position of the maximum Rmax in
the PEC we obtain a monotonous behavior in the range 0 ≤ B ≤ 100 a.u. First, Rmax exhibits only a minor decrease
from 9.03 to 8.29 a.u. for B = 0 and 0.1 a.u., respectively. Subsequently the position of Rmax decreases more rapidly
with further increasing ﬁeld strength, i.e in the range 0.1 ≤ B ≤ 100 a.u. where Rmax is shifted from 8.29 to 2.43 a.u.
Since the height of the maximum is very small, it cannot be observed in Fig. 5.

Many vibrational states exist in the entire range of ﬁeld strengths 0 ≤ B ≤ 100 a.u. Compared to the number of

levels in ﬁeld free space the number of levels slightly increases with increasing magnetic ﬁeld strength.

D. The 3Πu state

The PEC of the 3Πu state exhibits a deep potential well in ﬁeld free space which is located at an internuclear distance
of 1.96 a.u. In the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld the equilibrium internuclear distance Req remains approximately
constant for 0 ≤ B ≤ 0.01 a.u. At the same time the dissociation energy Ed varies only slightly, i.e. increases from
0.115522 to 0.112559 a.u. for B = 0 and B = 0.01 a.u., respectively. For larger ﬁeld strengths we observe a strong
increase in the dissociation energy and a simultaneous decrease in the corresponding equilibrium internuclear distance.
The corresponding data for the 3Πu state are presented in Table IV and the PEC is shown for diﬀerent ﬁeld strengths
in Fig. 6. The dissociation energy for B = 100 a.u. amounts to 1.811759 a.u. (cf. Table IV) which documents the
enormous increase in Ed to be clearly seen also in Fig. 6. An interesting phenomenon can be observed around a
ﬁeld strength of B = 100 a.u. For that ﬁeld strength regime the PEC of the 3Πu state exibits a shallow hump with
a maximum located at Rmax = 3.11 a.u. and a second minimum at Req2 = 4.51 a.u. (see Table IV). However, this
additional minimum is very shallow and the dissociation energy amounts to only 4.604 × 10−5 a.u. Therefore, both
the second minimum and the maximum cannot be seen in Fig. 6.

In the high ﬁeld regime, i.e. for ﬁeld strengths larger than 1×107 T, the 3Πu state has been investigated by Ortiz and
coworkers [18] and Lai [17]. The equilibrium internuclear distance Req for the 3Πu state at a ﬁeld strength of 1 × 107 T
was determined to be 0.51 a.u. with a total ground state energy of 163.03 eV at the equilibrium internuclear distance
Req [18]. In the present investigation we performed a calculation for the same ﬁeld strength 1 × 107 T (42.54414 a.u.)
and obtained a slightly diﬀerent equilibrium internuclear distance of 0.50 a.u. with a somewhat lower total energy
of 163.54409 eV . The diﬀerence in the total energy at R = 0.50 and 0.51 a.u. within our calculations amounts to
only 3.57 × 10−4 eV . The total energy in the separated atom limit within our calculations was determined to be
−4.798851 a.u. Compared with the best available data in the literature (see Ref. [18]) our result shows an improvement
of approximately 0.31% in the total energy and of 1.19% in the corresponding dissociation energy.

The number of vibrational levels for the ﬁrst well, which is about 20 in ﬁeld free space, remains of the same order
of magnitude for arbitrary ﬁeld strengths 0 ≤ B ≤ 100 a.u. For the second minimum occuring at a ﬁeld strength of
100 a.u., the lower estimate of the vibrational energy is located inside the well while the upper estimate lies above
and we therefore cannot decide whether it accomodates a vibrationally bound state.

V. THE GROUND STATE OF THE HYDROGEN MOLECULE IN A MAGNETIC FIELD

The ground state of the hydrogen molecule in ﬁeld free space is the 1Σ+

g singlet state. In the presence of a magnetic
ﬁeld, the diamagnetic term in the Hamiltonian (1) causes an increase in the total energy with increasing ﬁeld strength.
At the same time, due to the interaction of the total electronic spin with the magnetic ﬁeld, the spin-Zeeman shift
occuring for triplet states with (Ms = −1) lowers the total energy. As a result the 1Σg singlet state is not expected
to remain the global ground state of the parallel conﬁguration for suﬃciently strong ﬁelds. In Ref. [20] the crossing
between the PECs of the singlet 1Σg and triplet 3Σu state was determined to occur between B = 0.1 and 0.2 a.u. For
B >
∼ 0.2 a.u. the PEC of the 3Σu state is lower in energy than that of the 1Σg state and therefore represents the global
ground state of the H2 molecule for a certain range of ﬁeld strengths (see below). Since the PEC of the 3Σu state
is, apart from a very shallow van der Waals minimum, a purely repulsive curve the hydrogen molecule is unstable
(unbound) in the corresponding regime of ﬁeld strengths. For much higher ﬁeld strengths (B >
∼ 3 × 103 a.u.) it has
been shown [18] that the ground state of the parallel conﬁguration is the 3Πu state. The ﬁeld strength belonging to
the 3Σu / 3Πu crossing is however not yet known.

In the following we determine and discuss the crossings among the above-mentioned three states as a function of the
ﬁeld strength. In Figs. 7a and 7b we show the total energies at the corresponding equilibrium internuclear distances
of the 1Σg and 3Πu state as well as the total energy in the dissociation limit of the 3Σu state as a function of the
ﬁeld strength. First we focus on the crossings of the 1Σg with the 3Σu and 3Πu states which is illustrated in Fig. 7a.
The transition between the 1Σg and 3Σu state occurs at a ﬁeld strength of approximately 0.18 a.u. and the crossing
ﬁeld strength between the 3Σu and 3Πu state is determined to be at B ≈ 0.39 a.u. With further increasing magnetic
ﬁeld strength the total energy of the 1Σg state increases strongly and in particular the total energy of the 3Πu state
decreases more rapidly than that of the 3Σu state. Therefore, a transition occurs between the two latter states which
is illustrated in Fig. 7b. As can be seen from Fig. 7b, the transition ﬁeld strength occurs to be at B ≈ 12.3 a.u.

In conclusion we encounter the following situation for the H2 molecule oriented parallel to a magnetic ﬁeld: For
B <
∼ 0.18 a.u. the ground state is the strongly bound 1Σg state. For an intermediate range of ﬁeld strengths, i.e. for
0.18 <
∼ 12.3 a.u., the ground state is the unbound 3Σu state. This state exhibits only a very shallow minimum
which does not provide any vibrational level [20]. Therefore the ground state of the parallel conﬁguration is not bound
in the regime 0.18 <
∼ 12.3 a.u. This result is of great importance for astrophysics in order to decide whether

∼ B <

∼ B <

7

hydrogen molecules exist in the vicinity of white dwarfs. For magnetic ﬁelds B >
∼ 12.3 a.u. the ground state is again
a strongly bound, namely the 3Πu state and molecular hydrogen may exist in the vicinity of astrophysical objects
which exhibit such huge magnetic ﬁeld strengths.

VI. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

In the present investigation we studied the electronic structure of the hydrogen molecule subjected to an external
magnetic ﬁeld which is oriented parallel to the internuclear axis. We hereby focused on the lowest electronic states
of the Π subspace, i.e.
the lowest states with molecular magnetic quantum number equal to one. We discussed
our basis set of nonorthogonal nonspherical Gaussian orbitals and brieﬂy described the theoretical aspects of our CI
calculations.

First of all we discussed the general properties of the lowest Π states in ﬁeld free space and compared our results with
the existing data in the literature. Our results show an overall relative accuracy better than <
∼ 10−4 at the equilibrium
internuclear distances of the PECs and even further improves with increasing internuclear distance. Compared to the
results obtained for the lowest Σ states in ﬁeld free space [20], we approximately improved the accuracy in the energy
by one order of magnitude. This is most probably due to the smaller portion of correlation energy for the Π states.
Next we considered the lowest Π states in the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld. For the 1Πg state we observed a
monotonous decrease in the dissociation energy with increasing ﬁeld strength up to 0.1 a.u. and a simultaneous minor
increase in the equilibrium internuclear distance. At the same time the position of the occuring maximum was shifted
to smaller values of the internuclear distance. For a ﬁeld strength of 0.2 a.u. a metastable state with respect to the
dissociation into two hydrogen atoms exists in the PEC and for B >
∼ 0.5 a.u. both the minimum and the maximum
disappear. For the second, i.e. outer minimum the dissociation energy ﬁrst increases up to B <
∼ 1 a.u and than
decreases with further increasing ﬁeld strength. In order to decide whether vibrationally bound states exist in the
discussed PECs we determined upper and lower estimates for the vibrational energies. Up to a ﬁeld strength of
0.1 a.u. the 1Πg state was shown to accomodate a few vibrational levels. For the second well vibrationally bound
states exist in the range 0 ≤ B <
∼ B <
∼ 50 a.u. the existence of bound states depends on the detailed
nuclear dynamics of the molecule. For even larger ﬁeld strengths no vibrational levels were found.

∼ 2 a.u. For 5 <

For the PEC of the 3Πg state we observe a decrease in the dissociation energy and a simultaneous increase in the
equilibrium internuclear distance with increasing ﬁeld strength in the regime 0 ≤ B <
∼ 0.1 a.u. Metastable states with
∼ B <
respect to the dissociation into two H atoms were shown to exist for the range 0.2 <
∼ 0.5 a.u. For the position
of the maximum in the PEC we observed a monotonous decrease with increasing ﬁeld strength. For B >
∼ 1 a.u.
the maximum and the minimum disappear. We also studied the singlet-triplet energy splitting between the 1Πg and
3Πg (Ms = 0) state as a function of the magnetic ﬁeld strength. This is motivated by the fact that the corresponding
PECs in ﬁeld free space are almost indistinguishable for suﬃciently small internuclear distances. We hereby focused
on the rough shape of the PECs and neglected the properties due to the very shallow second minimum occuring in the
PEC of the 1Πg state. In the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld and with increasing ﬁeld strength we found an increase of the
splitting between these two states for small internuclear distances, i.e. for the region, where the corresponding PECs
are almost identical in ﬁeld free space. For larger internuclear distances we found a signiﬁcant diﬀerence between
the PECs of the 1Πg and 3Πg (Ms = 0) state for 1 <
∼ 20 a.u. For this regime of ﬁeld strengths the PEC of the
3Πg state exhibits no extrema but two turning points which do not exist in the corresponding PEC of the 1Πg state.
The maximum of the absolute value of the splitting was found to occur at a ﬁeld strength of approximately 20 a.u.
Vibrationally bound states were shown to exist up to B = 0.1 a.u.

∼ B <

For the PEC of the 1Πu state we ﬁrst observe a decrease in the dissociation energy up to a ﬁeld strength of
B ≈ 0.5 a.u. with increasing ﬁeld strength and subsequently a strong increase in the dissociation energy with further
increasing ﬁeld strength. At the same time the equilibrium internuclear distance decreases monotonously. For the
number of vibrational levels we found a minor increase by a few levels compared to the number of levels in ﬁeld free
space.

Next we studied the PEC of the 3Πu state in the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld. The dissociation energy and the
equilibrium internuclear distance remain nearly constant for small values of B, i.e.
∼ 0.1 a.u. With
further increasing ﬁeld strength we observe a strong increase in the dissociation energy. An interesting phenomenon
is the existence of an additional minimum and a maximum for a ﬁeld strength regime around 100 a.u. Despite the
shallowness of the corresponding well it may accomodate a vibrationally bound state. For the ﬁrst, i.e. well-pronounced
well vibrational states exist for all ﬁeld strengths 0 ≤ B ≤ 100 a.u.

for 0 ≤ B <

Finally we investigated the important transitions occuring among the 1Σg, 3Σu and 3Πu states.

It was shown
recently [20] that the strongly bound 1Σg state is the global ground state of the hydrogen molecule for B <
∼ 0.18 a.u.
and that the global ground state beyond 0.18 a.u. is the unbound 3Σu state up to some unknown critical ﬁeld strength

8

Bc. The 3Σu state exhibits a purely repulsive PEC apart from a shallow van der Waal minimum which does not
provide any vibrational level. An important result of the present investigation is that at approximately 12.3 a.u.
the ground state changes from the 3Σu state to the strongly bound 3Πu state. This is of great importance for the
chemistry in the atmosphere of certain degenerate astrophysical objects:
it may help to decide whether molecular
hydrogen can exist in the vicinity of white dwarfs. We emphasize that the present investigation was performed for
the case of parallel internuclear and magnetic ﬁeld axes. In order to draw a deﬁnite conclusion concerning the ground
state of the H2 molecule the electronic structure has to be investigated for arbitrary angles between the molecule and
the magnetic ﬁeld.

The above results may also give rise to an experimental scenario. Let us consider conﬁgurations with an angle in
the range 0 < θ < 90o, i.e. the internuclear axis is inclined with respect to the magnetic ﬁeld. Since the electronic
potential energy depends on both the internuclear distance R as well as the angle θ we are dealing with two dimensional
potential energy surfaces. The only remaining symmetry for such conﬁgurations for a homonuclear diatomic molecule
is the parity, i.e. the corresponding molecular symmetry group is Ci. We now brieﬂy address the question whether
diﬀerent electronic states may interact strongly through the nuclear motion. This problem was investigated in some
detail in Ref. [21]. It was shown that for a homonuclear diatomic molecule a two dimensional avoided crossing occurs
for electronic states with the same spatial symmetry and in particular that conical intersections can occur at θ = 0
or 90o for crossings of states with the same parity.

3Πu −3 Σu
(cid:0)

For θ 6= 0o we expect a crossing without interaction between the lowest state with gerade and the lowest state
with ungerade parity. More interestingly we expect a conical intersection to occur at θ = 0o for the PECs of the two
with ungerade parity. The hydrogen molecule in the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld therefore
lowest states
is an example for a simple system for which the ground state in strong ﬁelds exhibits a conical intersection. From
an experimental point of view we are hereby not restricted to the case of static external magnetic ﬁelds but could
also use pulsed ﬁelds. The time scale of the pulse is usually orders of magnitude larger than the time scale of the
nuclear motion near a conical intersection. For the case of the hydrogen molecule, the ﬁeld strength at which a conical
intersection of the lowest states with ungerade parity may be observed, is B >
∼ 0.1 a.u. which corresponds to a few
ten thousand Tesla. Pulsed magnetic ﬁelds of that strength may be reachable in the laboratory in the nearer future.

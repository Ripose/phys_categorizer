Abstract

Brueckner orbitals, and the density of the Brueckner reference-state, are shown to satify the same

cusp condition – involving the nuclear charges – as natural- and Hartree–Fock-orbitals. Using

the cusp condition, the density of a determinantal state can be used to determine the external

potential, if the determinantal state is from either Hartee–Fock or Brueckner-orbital theory, as

well as, determinant states obtained by many other formalisms that are deﬁned by a one-body

operator, if a portion of the one-body operator – the portion not associated with the kinetic energy

or external potential – generates a well behaved function when acting on an occupied orbital.

Using this relationship involving a determinant and its external potential, a variation of Reference–

State One–Particle Density–Matrix Theory [arXiv:physics/0308056] is formulated, where the trial

wavefunctions are universal, in the Kohn-Sham sense, since they do not depend on the external

potential. The resulting correlation-energy functionals, are also, universal, except for a relatively

small term involving the portion of the expectation value of the external potential with the trial

wavefunctions that appears beyond the ﬁrst order. The same approximate energy functionals that

were shown to be valid for the previous v-dependent, Reference–State One–Particle Density–Matrix

Theory [arXiv:physics/0308084], are shown to be valid for the current approach, except that the

use of the LYP and Colle–Salvetti functional appear more natural within the current approach,

since these functionals are universal ones. And since the BLYP and B3LYP functionals contain

the LYP functional, these approaches are also better suited with the current approach.

I. EXTERNAL POTENTIAL DETERMINED BY THE ONE-PARTICLE DEN-

SITY MATRIX AND THE PARTICLE DENSITY

There is a one-to-one correspondence between determinant states and their one-particle

density-matrices [1, 2]. Because of this correspondence, it is convenient to denote a deter-

minantal state that is determined by a one-particle density-matrix, say γ, simply by |γi. In

addition, any function, say G, that depends on γ, can be written as G(γ); this same notation

also indicates that G is determined by the corresponding determinant, |γi.

Consider the following noninteracting Hamiltonian:

n

H γ

s =

− 1

2 ∇2

ri + v(ri) + ˆwγ(xi)

,

i
X
where the external potential v is given by a ﬁxed set of point charges

(cid:0)

(cid:1)

v(r) = −

Xm∈{Rnuc}

Zm
|Rm − r|

,

and the summation is over the coordinates of the nuclear point charges, denoted by {Rnuc};

furthermore, ˆwγ may be non-local and this operator can depend on the spin-coordinate

ω, where the spatial and spin coordinates are denoted collectively by x; in addition, the γ

superscript appended to w indicates that this operator may also depend on γ (or equivalently

|γi).

Consider a determinantal state, say |γi, that satisﬁes the Schr¨odinger Eq:

H γ

s |γi = Eγ|γi,

where the Hamiltonian Hs is given by Eq. (1); furthermore, the noninteracting eigenstate,
|γi, can be expressed by a unique set of occupied orbitals, denoted by {ψo ← γ, ˆfγ}; each of

these orbitals satisfy the following one-particle Schr¨odinger Eq:

ˆfγψγ

xσ(x) = ǫγ

iσψγ

xσ(x), σ = α, β, ψγ

xσ ∈ {ψo ← γ, ˆfγ},

where the one-body operator is given by

ˆfγ = − 1

2∇2

r + v(r) + wγ(x).

In addition, we require the operator wγ to be Hermitian and satisfy

lim
|R−r|→0

|R − r|wγ(r, ω)ψγ

xσ(r, ω) = 0,

for all R.

giving

(9)

lim
r→R

|r − R|wγ(r, ω)ψγ

xσ(r, ω) = 0.

for all R.

Let us also mention that the set of unoccupied orbitals – orthogonal to {ψo ← γ, ˆfγ} – is
denoted by {ψu ← γ, ˆfγ} and, in addition, all of our spin-orbitals ψiσ(x) have the following

ψiσ(x) = χiσ(r)σ(ω), σ = α or β,

where the spatial and spin portions are given by χiσ(r) and σ(ω), respectively, and the spatial

functions χiσ(r) are permitted to be unrestricted – two spin orbitals do not, in general, share

the same spatial function, i.e., (χiα 6= χiβ) is permitted.

Multiplying Eq. (4) by |r − R| followed by taking a limit of this term vanishing, gives

Consider the set of (ground and excited) determinantal states, denoted {|γiv}, that are

eigenfunctions of Hs, given by Eq. (1), where the states from the set, {|γiv}, are obtained

from all wγ that satisfy Eq. (7), and from all Coulombic external-potentials v, given by

Eq. (2). From the density of any one of theses states, say ρ, we can determine its Coulombic

external-potential v by using Eqs. (29) and (2). Hence, v is a unique function of the density.

In other words, we have v(ρ), and this function is deﬁned for all densities that are from this

set of determinantal states, {|γiv}.

INVARIANCE OF OCCUPIED-ORBITAL TRANSFORMATION

We now partition the operator wγ into the following four components:

wγ = wγ

ex + wγ

de + wγ

oc + wγ

un,

where the excitation (ex), de-excitation (de), occupied (oc), and unoccupied (un) parts are

given by the following expressions:

xσ ∈ {ψo ← γ, ˆfγ},

ψγ

sσ ∈ {ψu ← γ, ˆfγ}.

and the occupied- and unoccupied-orbitals are, respectively, given by

The results from the previous Sec. indicate that v is a function of ρ for any ρ determined

from H γ
s , given by Eq. (1) – or, equivalently, any ρ determined from the one-body operator
ˆfγ given by (5) – when the operator wγ satisﬁes Eq. (7). Using the partitioning method

given above, Eq. (7) becomes

lim
|r−R|→0

|r − R| [wγ

oc(r, ω) + wγ

ex(r, ω)] ψγ

wσ(r, ω) = 0,

for all R,

(38)

indicating that Eq. (7) can be satisﬁed with any choice of wγ

de and wγ

un.

The above relation is satisﬁed when we have

lim
r→R
lim
r→R

|r − R|wγ

oc(r, ω)ψγ

wσ(r, ω) = 0,

|r − R|wγ

ex(r, ω)ψγ

wσ(r, ω) = 0.

(39a)

(39b)

It is easily proven that a determinantal state |γi that satisﬁes Eq. (3) – and the corre-

sponding density ρ from |γi – does not depend on wγ

oc; so, when considering the statements

appearing in the last paragraph of the previous section, we can relax the requirement that

6

Eq. (7) be satisﬁed, and only require Eq. (39b) to be satisﬁed. In other words, the density of

a determinantal state, that satisﬁes Eq. (3), can be used to determine its external potential,

given by Eq. (2), by using Eq. (29), if (39b) is satisﬁed. An equivalent statement refers to
the one-body operator ˆfγ: The density of a determinantal state can be used to determine

its external potential, given by Eq. (2), by using Eq. (29), if (39b) is satisﬁed, where the
orbitals deﬁning the determinantal state |γi are the occupied eigenfunctions of ˆfγ, deﬁned

by Eq. (5). Note that the wγ

the determinantal state does not depend on these components; wγ

un portions of the operator wγ are at our disposal, since
ex,
since wγ is required to be Hermitian. (The Hermitian requirement can be dropped by using

de is determined by wγ

oc and wγ

a biorthogonal basis set.)

III. HARTREE–FOCK DETERMINANTAL STATES

We now show that the set of Hartree–Fock determinantal states, say {|˜τ }, are members

of {|γiv}, indicating that their Coulombic external-potentials v can be uniquely determined

by their electron density, i.e., v(ρ), by using Eq. (29).

The occupied, canonical Hartree–Fock orbitals satisfy the following single particle Eq:

ˆF˜τ ψ ˜τ

xσ(x) = ǫ˜τ

xσψ ˜τ

xσ(x), σ = α, β, ψ ˜τ

xσ ∈ {ψo ← ˜τ , ˆF˜τ }

where the Fock operator is given by

ˆF˜τ = − 1

2 ∇2

r + v(r) +

r−1
12 ˜τ (x2, x2) dx2 + ˆv ˜τ

x(x),

and the one-particle density-matrix for the Hartree–Fock reference-state has the following

form:

˜τ (x, x′) =

ψ ˜τ

xσ(x) (ψ ˜τ

xσ(x′))∗ ;

Xxσ∈{ψo←˜τ , ˆF˜τ }

furthermore, the exchange operator, ˆvγ

x, is a non-local operator that is deﬁned by its kernel,

−r−1

12 γ. Therefore, for an arbitrary function, say ψ, we have

ˆv ˜τ
x(x1)ψ(x1) = −

dx2 r−1

12 ˜τ (x1, x2)ψ(x2).

Equating Eqs. (40) and (41) with (4) and (5), for (γ = ˜τ ), we have

Z

(40)

(41)

(42)

(43)

(44)

w ˜τ (x) =

r−1
12 ˜τ (x2, x2) dx2 + ˆv ˜τ

x(x),

Z

7

and it is easily seen that Eq. (7) is satisﬁed; so, the Hartree–Fock states are members of

{|γiv}, and we have v(˜̺) where ˜̺ is the Hartree–Fock density:

˜̺(r) =

˜τ (r, ω; r, ω).

(45)

ω
X

The Hartree–Fock Eqs. are usually solved using a iterative, self consistent ﬁeld (SCF)

approach, where the (m − 1)th iteration is given by

ˆF˜τm−1ψ ˜τm

xσ (x) = ǫ˜τm

xσ ψ ˜τm

xσ (x), σ = α, β, ψ ˜τm

xσ ∈ {ψo ← ˜τ , ˆF˜τm−1}

(46)

and its easily seen that Eq. (7) is satisﬁed for w ˜τm−1, so all determinantal states determined

during the SCF approach are also members of {|γiv}.

Consider another Hermitian Fock-type operator, say ˆF ′

γ, that is given by

where the excitation (ex) portion of the additional exchange-operator ˆvγ

x+ is zero:

γ = ˆFγ + ˆvγ
ˆF ′

x+

ˆvγ
x+

ex = 0.

(cid:0)

(cid:1)

(47)

(48)

Hence, according to Sec. II, Eq. (39b) remains satisﬁed and, in addition, the determinantal
state deﬁned by the occupied orbitals, from ˆF ′
γ, is the as same the determinantal state from
ˆFγ; it is a member of {|γiv}; so, again, the density of this determinantal state can be used

to determine the external potential v, Eq. (2), by using Eq. (29). Furthermore, since the
occupied eigenfunctions from ˆF ′

˜τ , given by

ˆF ′
˜τ ψ′˜τ

xσ(x) = ǫ˜τ

xσψ′˜τ

xσ(x), σ = α, β, ψ′˜τ

xσ ∈ {ψo ← ˜τ , ˆF ′
˜τ }

(49)

diﬀer only by a unitary transformation from the ˆF˜τ occupied orbitals, {ψo ← ˜τ , ˆF˜τ }. There-

fore, and of course, the one-particle density-matrix obtained from these occupied orbitals

are equivalent:

˜τ (x, x′) =

xσ(x) (ψ′˜τ
ψ′˜τ

xσ(x′))∗ ,

(50)

where this one-particle density-matrix ˜τ is the same one appearing in Eq. (42).

Xxσ∈{ψo←˜τ , ˆF ′
˜τ }

IV. GENERALIZED FOCK OPERATOR

Consider a generalized Fock-operator ˆFγ, where its occupied orbitals satisfy

ˆFγψγ

xσ(x) = εγ

xσψγ

xσ(x), σ = α, β, ψγ

xσ ∈ {ψo ← γ, ˆFγ}

and ˆFγ is given by

ˆFγ = − 1

2∇2

r + v(r) +

r−1
12 γ(x2, x2) dx2 + ˆvγ

x(x) + ˆvγ

co(x).

Comparing the above two Eqs. with (4) and (5), we obtain a new deﬁnition for wγ:

Z

Z

wγ(x) =

r−1
12 γ(x2, x2) dx2 + ˆvγ

x(x), +ˆvγ

co(x).

and substituting this expression into Eq. (39b), gives

lim
r→R

|r − R| [ˆvγ

co(r, ω)]ex ψγ

wσ(r, ω) = 0,

for all R.

(51)

(52)

(53)

(54)

Hence, if this relation is satisﬁed, the determinantal state deﬁned by the occupied orbitals,
from ˆFγ, is a member of {|γiv}; so, again, the density of this determinantal state can be

used to determine the external potential v, Eq. (2), by using Eq. (29).

V. BRUECKNER DETERMINANTAL STATES

We seek solutions of the time-independent Schr¨odinger equation,

Hv|Ψi = E|Ψi,

(55)

where Hv denotes the Hamiltonian operator deﬁned by the external potential v, where

the Hamiltonian is independent of the number of electrons when it is expressed in second

quantization:

and the creation and annihilation operators, a†

iσ and aiσ, correspond to the unrestricted

spin-orbitals, ψiσ, deﬁned by Eq. (8).

The wavefunction of interest |Ψi can be generated by a wave operator Ωγ:

Ωγ|γi = (1 + χγ)|γi = |Ψi,

(59)

and the second relation deﬁnes the correlation operator, χγ; furthermore, |γi is any deter-

minantal reference-state that overlaps with the target state: (hγ|Ψi 6= 0).

Brueckner orbital theory [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21] is

a generalization of Hartree–Fock theory that utilizes a single-determinantal state that has

the maximum overlap with the target state [22, 23]. By deﬁnition, if |τ i is a Brueckner

reference-state, then the target state, |Ψi, contains no singly-excited states from |τ i:

and the singly-excited states are given by

where the Brueckner-state occupied- and unoccupied-orbitals are, respectively, given by

and this notation indicates that the occupied orbitals determine τ ; furthermore, the unoc-

cupied orbitals also determine τ since the union of the two orthogonal sets (of orbitals) is a

Note that, unlike the orbitals that are deﬁned by Eq. (36), the occupied orbitals that

satisfy Eq. (62) are not completely deﬁned; they are invariant to a unitary transformation;

similarly, the unoccupied orbitals that satisfy Eq. (63) are also invariant to a unitary trans-

formation. Using a set of these orbitals, the Brueckner one-particle density-matrix is given

Xrσ∈{ψu→τ }

δ(x, x′) = κτ (x, x′) + τ (x, x′).

Since our Hamiltonian, given by Eq. (56), is spin-free, it is easily demonstrated that we

hγrσ′

wσ |Ψi = 0,

for σ 6= σ′ and hγ|Ψi 6= 0 ;

hence, we can modify the deﬁnition for a Brueckner reference-state, given by Eq. (60), and

only consider the spin-conserving matrix-elements:

hτ rσ

wσ|Ψi = 0.

Because of spin symmetry, Eq. (67) certainly holds when |γi is a determinantal state that
is an eigenfunction of the total spin angular-momentum operator, ˆS2, e.g., a closed-shell

ground-states with spatially restricted spin orbitals. However, this identity should also hold

in more general cases, since, diagrammatically speaking, the spin state – either α or β –

must be conserved along an oriented path [24], and wσ and rσ′ are on the same oriented

path. In order to simplify our discussions, henceforth, we only consider cases where Eq. (67)

holds; however, the result are easily generalized to the more general case, e.g., when the

Hamiltonian is spin-dependent.

Substituting Eqs. (55) and (59) into (68), sequentially, we obtain

0 = hτ rσ

wσ|Ψi = hτ rσ

wσ|Hv|Ψi = hτ rσ

wσ|HvΩτ |τ i = hτ rσ

wσ|Hv|τ i + hτ rσ

wσ|Hvχτ |τ i,

(69)

and the vanishing of the above matrix elements involving Hv is know as the Brillouin–

Brueckner condition [7, 9, 9, 22, 25, 26]. Writing the operator-product Hvχτ in normal-

ordered form [24, 27, 28, 29] with respect to the reference state |τ i, the last matrix element

of the above Eq. becomes

hτ rσ

wσ|Hvχτ |τ i = hτ rσ

wσ| (Hvχτ )1 |τ i,

(70)

In the above matrix elements, the ones that do not preserve the spin, i.e., (U jσ′

(The vanishing of these matrix elements occurs, diagrammatically speaking, since the spin

state – either α or β – must be conserved along an oriented path [24], and iσ and jσ′ are

on the same oriented path.)

Substituting Eq. (71) into (70) and using (72) and (73), gives

hτ rσ

wσ| [(Hvχτ )1]op |τ i.

Since the one-body operator-product [(Hvχτ )1]op can also act within the one-body sector of
the Hilbert space, we have the following identity:

hτ rσ

Substituting Eq. (70) into the Brillouin–Brueckner condition, Eq. (69), and using Eq. (75)

and (76), and also the following identity:

where the introduced correlation potential ˆvτ

(ˆvτ

and the operators, ( ˆFτ )ex and (ˆvτ

co)ex, are deﬁned in an analogous way as wγ

ex, as indicated

by Eqs. (31) through (35).

Since the above form of the Brillouin–Brueckner condition, given by Eq. (78), is satisﬁed

by all pairs of orbitals involving one unoccupied-orbital and one occupied-orbital, we have

where the generalized, or exact, Fock operator is deﬁned by

(cid:17)

ˆFτ = ˆFτ + ˆvτ

Comparing this deﬁnition of ˆFτ with the one given by Sec. IV, Eq. (52), and using Eq. (41),

we see that, for (γ = τ ), the two deﬁnitions are equivalent, except that in this Sec. we require

the excitation (ex) portion of the correlation potential ˆvτ

co to satisfy Eq. (79); by arbitrarily
co we can diagonalize ˆFτ , and this eigenvalue Eq. is given by

deﬁning the other portions of ˆvτ

Eq. (51) for (γ = τ ):

ˆFτ ψτ

where (ˆvτ

states {|τ i} are member of {|γiv}; so, again, the density of a Brueckner determinantal state

can be used to determine its external potential v, Eq. (2), by using Eq. (29).

Unfortunately we have been unable to prove that Eq. (83) is an identity by using Eq. (84).

So, as an alternative approach, consider the case where the above identity, given by Eq. (83),

is not necessarily satisﬁed. As in the derivation Eq. (9), by multiplying Eq. (82) by |r1 − R|

followed by taking a limit of this term vanishing, gives the following identity that must be

co)oc to be zero, since, according to the discussion
within Sec. II, this portion is at our disposal; the one-particle density-matrix τ is invariant

to this choice.

the density of the Brueckner-determinantal state can be used to determine the external

VI. ONE-PARTICLE DENSITY-MATRIX THEORY

A. Variational Brueckner orbital theory

Reference-state one-particle density-matrix theory [30, 31, 34] is based on Brueckner or-

bital theory [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21]. Unlike many other

density functional formalisms based on variants of the Konh–Sham method, the correlation

operator for this approach is non-local. The approach also uses an energy functional that

depends on the one-particle density-matrix of a reference determinantal-state, and not the

exact one from the target state, where the energy functional is partitioned into the exact

exchange-energy and a correlation-energy functional that is non-universal, since this func-

tional depends on the external potential v. We now modify this formalism to remove –

for the most part – the dependence of the correlation energy-functional upon the external

potential. However, an additional term that describes a portion of the potential energy is

also included that does not have an analog in Kohn–Sham approaches. However, this term

can be easily treated once the kinetic energy functional is known or, in many cases, this term

can be neglected, since it is probably quite small. For convenience, we refer to the previous

works [30, 31, 34] as being v-dependent, even though we still retain some v-dependence in

the correlation-energy functionals for the current approach under consideration.

In this previous work [30, 31, 34], we introduced four v-dependent trial wavefunctions

– say |Ψ(η)

γv i, where (η = I, II, III, and IV) – that are deﬁned with respect to an exter-
nal potential v and a one-particle density-matrix, where γ is from a single-determinantal

reference-state, |γi.

the single excitations removed:

The ﬁrst trial-wavefunction |Ψ(I)

γvi is simply the target state of interest, say |ΨNvi, with

|Ψ(I)

γvi = (1 − P γ

11) |ΨNvi,

(91)

where |ΨNvi is a ground-state determined by the external potential v and the number of

15

electrons N and, furthermore, the spin-conserved projector for the singly-excited states is

P γ

11 =

|γrσ

wσihγrσ

wσ|,

Xwσ∈{ψo→γ} Xrσ∈{ψu→γ}

(92)

where we assume that Eq. (67) holds, but this requirement can easily be dropped by append-
ing the states |γrσ′
determined by |γi; P γ

wσ i the the right side of Eq. (92). Note that the P γ

11 is also invariant to a unitary transformation of occupied, or virtual,

11 subspace is completely

orbitals [13].

We now require the state |γi to be a member of {|γiv}, so Eq. (91) becomes

|Ψ(I)

γv′i = (1 − P γ

11) |ΨNv′i, γ ∈ {|γiv}, γ → v, γ → N,

(93)

where the prime superscripts appended to the external potentials, i.e., v′, emphasizes that

the potential deﬁning the states, |Ψ(I)

γv′i and |ΨNv′i, may diﬀer from the one determined by
γ (indicated by γ → v). However, we now restrict these potentials to be equivalent, i.e.,

(v′ = v), and generate the target state using a wave operator:

|Ψ(I)

γvi = (1 − P γ

11) |ΨNvi = (1 − P γ

11) Ωγv|γi, γ ∈ {|γiv}, γ → v,

(94)

and since the external potential is a unique function of γ (or the density ρ of γ), we can use

the function v(γ) to express the wave operator as a unique function of γ:

Ωγv = Ωγ γ ∈ {|γiv}, γ → v, γ → N,

and for are target state, we have

|Ψγi = |ΨNvi, γ → v, γ → N.

(95)

(96)

Therefore, we are assuming that the target state is completely determined by γ. This is a

reasonable assumption, since the Hamiltonian is completely determined by γ, since γ gives

the number of electrons, N, and the external potential v. In addition, however, we must also

make the assumption that the wave operator is, or – at least, in principle – can be uniquely

deﬁned so that it generates only one exact eigenstate – the ground state – from all γ that

have (γ → v). This implies, however, two wavefunctions can diﬀer only by a constant, say

c, if they are obtained from density-matrices that determine the same external potential:

|Ψγi = c|Ψγ′i,

if γ → v, γ′ → v′, and v = v′,

(97)

16

where the γ subscript also indicates the normalization of the target state:

hγ|Ψγi = 1.

(98)

By substituting Eqs. (95) and (96) into (94), we obtain a trial wavefunction that can be

assumed to be determined by γ:

|Ψ(I)

γ i = (1 − P γ

11) Ωγ|γi = (1 − P γ

11) |Ψγi, γ ∈ {|γiv},

(99)

and we have

|Ψ(I)

γ i = c|Ψ(I)

γ′ i,

if γ → v, γ′ → v′, and v = v′,

hγ|Ψ(I)

γ i = 1.

The second trial-wavefunction |Ψ(II)

γ i is deﬁned with respect to the target state expressed

by an exponential ansatz: (|Ψi = eSγ |γi), where |Ψ(II)
excitation amplitudes Sγ

1 from the cluster-operator S:

γ i is generated by removing the single-

|Ψ(II)

γ i = e(Sγ −Sγ

1 )|γi,

where, as in Eq. (95), we have

Sγv = Sγ γ ∈ {|γiv}, γ → v, γ → N.

The third trial-wavefunction |Ψ(III)

i can be generated by its wave-operator:

γ

that can be expressed in an exponential form: ( ˆΩγ = e ˆSγ |γi), where ˆSγ can be written as a

sum n-body excitations, with the exclusion of a one-body operator:

ˆΩγ|γi = |Ψ(III)

i,

γ

ˆSγ = ˆSγ

2 + ˆSγ

3 + · · · .

The wave operator ˆΩγ is a solution to the coupled cluster equations [27, 28, 29, 35, 36, 37,

38, 39, 40, 41] with the single excitation portion removed:

where only the open (op) and connected (cn) portions enter into the relation. This expression

γ

replacing Ωγ.

The fourth trial wavefunctions |Ψ(IV)

i is not considered here, except to mention that it

γ

is obtained by solving the conﬁguration-interaction equations [5, 41, 42] in an approximate

way, i.e., by neglecting the single-excitation portion.

All of the trial states |Ψ(η)

γ i share the property that they contain no single excitations,

i.e., (P γ

11|Ψ(η)

γ i = 0), and they generate the target state |Ψτ i when their reference state

satisﬁes (|γi = |τ i), where |τ i is the determinantal state constructed from occupied Bruckner

orbitals. In other words, we have

|Ψ(η)

τ i = |Ψτ i.

(107)

Since the target state is a solution of the Schr¨odinger equation (55) with an exact energy,

say ENv, we have

ENv =

hΨγ|Hv|Ψγi
hΨγ|Ψγi

= E1[γ, v] + Eco[γ, v] = hHviγ,

(108)

where the ﬁrst-order energy E1 is given by the expectation value of the Hamiltonian in-

volving the reference state, hγ|Hv|γi, and the correlation energy Eco is deﬁned above as

(ENv − E1); furthermore, the introduced notation hHviγ indicates the expectation value of

the Hamiltonian involving the target state |Ψγi.

Using the trial wavefunctions, we can deﬁne variational energy-functionals that depend

on the one-particle density-matrix:

¯Eη[γ, v] = hHviγη = E1[γ, v] + ¯E (η)

co [γ, v],

where we use the notation for the expectation value of an operator, say ˆA, given by

(109)

(110)

h ˆAiγη =

γ | ˆA|Ψ(η)
hΨ(η)
γ i
γ |Ψ(η)
hΨ(η)
γ i

and the last relation within Eq. (109) deﬁnes the correlation-energy functionals ¯E (η)
( ¯Eη − E1); furthermore, the ﬁrst order energy is given by

co as

δEx[γ]

12 γ(x1, x2) = vγ

x(x1, x2),

(120)

and the function vγ

x(x1, x2) is the kernel of the exchange operator, denoted by ˆvγ
x.

Using the variation theorem, and by noting the identity given by Eq. (107), it becomes

obvious – as in our previous v-dependent approach [30, 31] – that the minimizing of the
functionals ¯Eη[γ, v], subject to the constraint that the one-particle density-matrix comes

from a single-determinantal state, yields

where ENv and Eco the electronic-energy and correlation energy arising from the target state,

deﬁned by Eqs. (108); furthermore, τ is the one-particle density-matrix of the Brueckner

reference-state |τ i that determines v:

τ (x, x′) =

ψw(x)ψ∗

w(x′), τ → v,

(123)

Xw∈{ψo→τ }

and the Brueckner orbitals satisfy the following equivalent conditions:

ˆ1 − τ

ˆζ (η)
τ τ = 0,

(cid:0)

(cid:1)

where these orbitals do not depend of η – any trial wavefunction gives the same results.

A unique set of occupied and unoccupied orbitals is obtained by requiring the occupied

and unoccupied blocks of ˆζ (η)
τ

to be diagonal:

ˆζ (η)
τ ψτ
ˆζ (η)
τ ψτ

w(x) = ξ τ

(125a)

Henceforth, the orbitals sets that satisfy Eqs. (124) and (125) are denoted by {ψτ

and {ψτ

VIII. APPROXIMATIONS

If we know the exact correlation energy Eco for some Brueckner one-particle density-

matrix, say τ ′ with some external potential, say v′, where τ ′ → v′, then using Eq. (122), we

obtain the following reasonable approximation:

¯E (III)

co [γ, v] = Eco[τ ′, v′](τ ′=γ,v′=v), τ ′ → v′,

(140)

where a similar approximation has been used previously in the v-dependent approach [30,

31, 34], and we are are assuming, as we have previously, that this approximation is most

appropriate for (η = III). Similarly, a reasonable approximation for the components of the

correlation-energy functionals are given by the following prescriptions:

V (III)
co

[γ, v] = Vco[τ ′, v′](τ ′=γ,v′=v), τ ′ → v′,

and the three functionals: Vco, Tco and Uco, are known for a Brueckner one-particle density-

matrix τ ′ that determines the external potential v′, i.e., τ ′ → v′. Of course, we have

many Brueckner one-particle density-matrices τ coming from the same external potential v;

presumable, we have one τ from each N–electron sector of the Hilbert space, for external

potentials v with nondegenerate ground states.
The correlation-energy functionals ¯E (η)

exclusively form the correlated potential-energy-functional V (III)

co dependence on the external potential v comes
. In many cases it is reason-

co

able to assume that the this functionals, and the kinetic energy one T (III)

co , are small, since

the potential- and kinetic-energy contributions are treated well in ﬁrst order. Therefore, the

following approximation seems reasonable:

¯E (III)

co [γ] ≈ Uco[τ ′](τ ′=γ),

(144)

and this approximation yields a universal functional in the Kohn–Sham sense – the functional

does not depend on v. However, even the potential energy contribution to the correlation-

energy functional, V (η)

co , can be viewed – in a more general sense – as being universal, since if

this functional is known for an arbitrary external potential, than it is known for other cases,

since the manner in which this functional depends on the external potential is the same for

22

all systems. On the other hand, if we use a model system to approximate the functionals,

this will certainly not generate exact functionals for real systems, only approximation ones.

Using the helium atom as a model system where Uco is presumable known, the previous

approximation becomes

where τhe is the Brueckner one-particle density matrix from the helium atom. Assuming the

Hartree–Fock one-particle density-matrix, say ˜τhe, is approximately equal to the Brueckner

one, τhe, we have

we have

¯E (III)

co [γ] ≈ Uco[τhe](τhe=γ),

¯E (III)

co [γ] ≈ Uco[˜τhe](˜τhe=γ),

¯E (III)

co [ρ1] ≈ Uco[˜̺1he](˜̺1he=ρ1),

and for a closed-shell systems that use spatially-restricted spin-orbitals, given by Eq. (A1),

(145)

(146)

(147)

where ρ1 is the spinless one-particle density matrix [2, 43], given by Eq. (A2). As demon-

strated in Appendix A, we can use the well known approximation for U cs

co[˜̺1he] given by the

Colle and Salvetti functional [44, 45], giving

¯E (III)

co [ρ1] ≈ Ecs

co[ρ1] = U cs

co[˜̺1he](˜̺1he=ρ1),

(148)

where this functional, denoted by Ecs

co, uses four empirical parameters that are determined

using data from the helium atom. In addition, it is reaily veriﬁed that this approximate

correlation-energy functional neglects the potential- and kinetic-energy components, Vco and

Tco, and these terms vanish when the exact one-particle density matrix, say Γ1, from the

target state |Ψγi, is equal to the reference state one, γ; these two terms are considered to be

small, or small enough to neglect, when (Γ1 ≈ γ1), as in the approach used when deriving

the Colle–Salvetti functional. (Note that Vco vanishes if the density from the reference-state

is the same as the density from the target state, as is the case for the Kohn–Sham method.)

Using an identical derivation as in the v-dependent approach [34], it is readily veriﬁed

that the well known density-dependent approximation for the Colle–Salvetti functional [45],

given by the LYP functional – at least for closed shell ground states – remains valid for the

current approach:

Ecs

co[ρ] ≈ Elyp

co [ρ],

23

(149)

where the density ρ dependence is associated with the reference state, and not the target

state.

An electron gas deﬁned by an constant external potential is not a member of {|γiv}, as

in the case for an electron gas with periodic boundary conditions. However, let us assume

that we can generalize the functional v(ρ) so that it yields the appropriate constant value,

say vg, from the constant-density of an electron gas, say ρg; so, we have (v(ρg) = vg). And

if we denote the one-particle density-matrix of the Brueckner reference state for an electron

gas by τg, we get

¯E (III)

co [γ, v] ≈ Eco[τg, vg](τg =γ,vg=v).

(150)

However, since the correlation energy Eco does not depend on on the constant external

potential vg, we cannot make the substitution (vg = v), and so we obtain an approximation

that yields a universal functional:

¯E (III)

co [γ] ≈ E (gas)

co

[τg](τg =γ),

(151)

where E (gas)

co

is the correlation energy of an electron gas, and this approximation is also

identical to the approximation used in the v-dependent approach [30, 31], but with a slightly

diﬀerent interpretation and derivation. Furthermore, in order to include τg in the set {|γiv},

we only need to require v(ρ) to vanishes for any constant density: (v(ρg) = 0), where we

consider two external-potentials that diﬀer by a constant to be equivalent.

Starting with Eq. (151), except using a uniform electron gas, the same correlation energy-

function used in the local density approximation (LDA) [46] was shown to be valid with the

v-dependent approach, for closed shell ground states [34]; however, in contrast to the Kohn–

Sham approach, the density dependence of the correlation-energy function is only associated

with the reference state, and not, in addition, the target state. Furthermore, using an identi-

cal derivation as in the v-dependent approach, it is easily veriﬁed that the correlation-energy
functional from LDA can also be used, as well, as an approximation for ¯E (III)

co within the cur-

rent approach under consideration. Furthermore, since the exchange-energy functional in

the current approach is identical with the one from the v-dependent method, the exchange-

energy functionals that are valid in the v-dependent approach are also valid in the current

approach, including the Dirac exchange-functional, and the augmentation of this functional

with the Becke exchange correction [47]. Hence, as in the v-dependent approach, the LDA

24

and the method known as BLYP are also valid in the current method. (At least for closed

shell ground states.) Furthermore, it is readily veriﬁed that the B3LYP approach [48, 49] –

that was demonstrated to be a reasonable approximation within the v-dependent approach

for closed-shell ground-states [34] – remains valid for current approach under consideration.

While all functionals that have been shown, so far, to be valid approximations for the

v-dependent approach, are also valid in the current approach, the use of the LYP and Colle–

Salvetti functional appear more natural within the current approach under consideration,

since these functionals are universal ones that do not have a dependence on the external

potential. And since the BLYP and B3LYP functionals contain the LYP functional, these

approaches are also better suited with the current approach.

APPENDIX A: CONNECTION WITH COLLE–SALVETTI FUNCTIONAL

In order to keep the discussion simple, we only consider closed-shell singlet states that

are well described by a single determinantal-state, where we use spatially-restricted spin-

orbitals, given by

ψjσ(x) = χj(r)σ(ω); σ = α, β.

By using these orbitals, it is easily demonstrated that the one-particle density-matrix γ is

determined by the spinless one, as indicated by the following relation:

Hence, any functional of γ now becomes a functional of ρ1; So, if we use the Hartree–Fock

spin-less one-particle density matrix, say ˜̺1, Eq. (108), becomes

γ(x1, x2) =

ρ1(r1, r2)δω1ω2.

ENv = E1[˜̺1, v] + Eco[˜̺1, v].

Substituting Eq. (136) into this expression for (γ1 = ̺1), and neglected the terms Vco and

explicitly on ˜̺1 [45]. (Note that ˜̺2 is determined by ˜̺1, as indicated by Eq. (A11).)

Comparing this Eqs. (A8) and (A13), gives the desired result:

Ecs

co[˜̺1] = Uco[˜̺1].

ENv = E1[˜̺1, v] + Ecs

(A15)

(A16)

in agreement with the Colle–Salvetti electronic energy expresion used in their derivation of

APPENDIX B: DERIVATION OF Eq. (84)

Using the occupied and unoccupied Brueckner orbitals, given by Eqs. (62) and (63),

respectively, we can express the one-body operator (ˆvτ

co)ex in the following manner:

(ˆvτ

co)ex =

hrσ| (ˆvτ

co)ex |wσia†

rσawσ,

(B1)

wσ
X

rσ
X

Z Z

where, as in (Hχτ )1, the vanishing terms involving the matrix elements that do not preserve
co)ex |wσi for σ 6= σ′, are omitted. The matrix elements in the

the spin state, , i.e., hrσ′| (ˆvτ

above expression can be computed using the kernel from the operator:

hrσ| (ˆvτ

co)ex |wσi =

ψτ

rσ(x)vτ ex

co (x, x′)ψτ

wσ(x′) dx dx′;

(B2)

so, if we have the an expression for the matrix element on the left-hand side, that has the

general form given by the integral on the right-hand side, we should by able to obtain the

kernel vτ ex

co (x, x′) and, therefore, (ˆvτ

co)exψτ

wσ, from the following deﬁnition:

(ˆvτ

co(x))ex ψτ

wσ(x) =

co (x, x′)ψτ
vτ ex

wσ(x′) dx′.

(B3)

In order to obtain an expression for the term on the left side of Eq. (86), below we obtain

the diagrammatic expansion of the open portion of (Hχτ )1, where this operator gives the

Z

27

matrix elements hrσ′|ˆvτ

co|wσi using Eqs. (79) and (B2). We then use this matrix element to

determine ˆvτ

coψτ

wσ and obtain the identity given by Eq. (84).

It is well known that the correlation operator χτ is given by a linked-diagram expansion,

where all disconnected pieces are open [29, 38, 50]. Since χτ does not contain a one-body

portion, it is easily demonstrated that the open portion of (Hχτ )1 is connected – all discon-
nected pieces from χτ are connected by the Hamiltonian H.

Using the diagrammatic formalism presented in Appendix C and elsewhere [30], consider

the following example of a diagram that contributes to the open portion of (Hχτ )1:

= ˆFτ 1κτ (x1, x2)g(x2, x1′)ψτ

wσ(x1′)ψτ ∗

rσ(x1)a†

rσawσ,

(B4)

where the repeated indices, wσ and rσ, are summed over and where the two body function

is given by

g(x2, x1′) =

τ τ (x4, x5) ˆFτ 5κτ (x5, x6)κτ (x6, x4)r−1
ε−4

62 r−1

41′κτ (x2, x3) ˆFτ 3κτ (x3, x′

1);

(B5)

furthermore, it is understood that there are no integrations over x2 and x1′ on the right

side of Eq. (B5), since these variables are not repeated indices according to the following

convention: When determining which dummy indices are repeated indices, indices appearing

within operators are not counted. So, for example, the indices x2 and x′

1 appear only once

in the above Eq, and not two times, since the dummy indices from the Coulombic operator,
i.e., x2 (and x6) from r−1

41′, are not counted.
rσ, presented in Eq. (B4), can be any Brueckner orbitals, as deﬁned

1 (and x4) from r−1

The orbitals ψτ

62 and x′

wσ and ψτ

by Eqs. (62) and (63). However, for convenience we choose the canonical orbitals that are
eigenfunctions of ˆFτ , as deﬁned by Eq. (82). Using these orbitals the Brueckner one-particle

density-matrix, τ , and the orthogonal function, κτ , are given by

τ (x, x′) =

ψτ

xσ(x) (ψτ

xσ(x′))∗ ,

κτ (x, x′) =

ψτ

rσ(x) (ψτ

rσ(x′))∗ ,

Xxσ∈{ψo←τ, ˆFτ }

Xrσ∈{ψu←τ, ˆFτ }

(B6)

(B7)

where these functions are also given by Eqs. (64) and (65).

28

According to Eq. (79), the diagram from Eq. (B4) also contributes to (ˆvτ

co)ex. Comparing

Eqs. (B1) and (B4) we see that the following term:

ˆFτ 1κτ (x1, x2)g(x2, x1′)ψτ

wσ(x1′)ψτ ∗

rσ(x1),

contributes to the matrix element hr| (ˆvτ

co)ex |wi; furthermore, and diagrammatically speak-
ing, removing the incoming and outgoing free-lines from the operator given by Eq. (B4),

yields

1

1′

= ˆFτ 1κτ (x1, x2)g(x2, x1′),

(B8)

and this diagram contributes to vτ ex

co)ex, as deﬁned by Eq. (B2);
furthermore, we use the following diagrammatic representation for this two-body function:

co (x1, x1′), the kernel of (ˆvτ

vτ ex
co (x1, x1′) =

vco

1′

1

(B9)

where, in addition, the non-dummy indices x1 and x1′ in the above two diagrams, by our

convention, correspond to the vertices of the omitted outgoing and incoming lines, respec-

tively. Note that we have labeled these indices in the diagrams above; however, we will often

omit these labels in similar (kernel) diagrams below.

As a slight variation of the diagram given within Eq. (B4), consider the following diagram:

=

ˆFτ 1κτ (x1, x2)g(x2, x1′)ψτ

w(x1′)ψτ ∗

r (x1)a†

raw,

(B10)

1
2

where the additional factor of 1

the diagram within Eq. (B4), this diagram contributes to (ˆvτ

2 comes from the diagonal term, given by Eq. (C20a). As in
co)ex; the corresponding diagram

that contributes to the kernel vτ ex

co (x1, x1′) can be expressed in two alternative forms:

1

1

=

=

ˆFτ 1κτ (x1, x2)g(x2, x1′),

(B11)

1
2

1′

1′

where the ﬁrst diagram on the left side replaces the incoming and outgoing omitted-lines

with dotted lines; this form gives a visual aid in determining the excitations involved and a

psudo hole-line for the diagonal term to reside on.

29

The diagrams appearing in Eqs. (B8) and (B11) are examples of one-body kernel-diagrams
where the omitted outgoing free-line is attached at a ˆFτ 1 vertex and the omitted incoming-
line is attached at the x1′ vertex of a r−1

j1′ operator. (In this particular case we have (j = 4),
according to Eq. (B5)). Furthermore, note that the Fock operator is acting upon excited
orbitals, giving the ˆFτ 1κτ (x1, x2) term. Summing over all diagrams of this type, we have

ˆFτ 1κτ (x1, x2)G(x2, x1′)

=

+

+

+

where the two-body function G(x2, x1′) is obtained from the inﬁnite-order expansion, and,

for brevity, we have only displayed the ﬁrst four diagrams of the series.

Introducing a

diagrammatic symbol for G(x2, x1′), we can represent the above expansion in the following

manner:

ˆFτ 1κτ (x1, x2)G(x2, x1′) =

1

2

G

1′

As a slight variation of the diagrams from the series appearing in Eq. (B12), we also have

diagrams that have the Fock operator acting upon occupied orbitals, e.g.,

=

ˆFτ 1τ (x1, x2)g(x2, x1′),

1
3

where g(x2, x1′) is given by Eq. (B5). Summing over all diagrams of this type, as in

Eqs. (B12) and (B13), we have

ˆFτ 1τ (x1, x2)I(x2, x1′) =

The diagram sums represented by Eqs. (B13) and (B15) include all diagram where the
omitted outgoing free-line is attached at a ˆFτ 1 vertex and the omitted incoming-line is at-
tached at the x1′ vertex of a r−1

j1′ operator. Two examples where both incoming and outgoing

omitted-lines are connected to Fock operators are given by the following two diagrams:

(B17)

The other two cases of interest involve diagrams where both incoming and outgoing

where the omitted incoming free-line is attached at a ˆFτ 1
line is attached at the x1 vertex of a r−1

j1 operator. Examples of these two case are given by

the following two diagrams:

include all possible diagrams that can contribute to vτ ex

that contribute to P (x1, x1′) – e.g., x1, x2, x3, x4, x4, and x6 for p(x1, x1′) as presented in
Eq. (B24) – are also dummy integration variables. Hence, since the functions r−1

APPENDIX C: DIAGRAMMATIC FORMALISM FOR THE CORRELATION

ENERGY Eco

In order to keep the notation less cluttered, for this section we use a combined spin-spatial

notation for spin-orbital indices; for example, ψτ

wσ is now denoted by ψτ
w.

A diagrammatic expansion for correlation-energy Eco, or for χτ using Lindgren’s formalism

[29, 38, 50]), is easier to obtain when all operators involved are written in normal-ordered

form [24, 28, 29, 51]. For example, the Hamiltonian, given by Eq. (56), can be written as

H = E1[τ ] + { ˆFτ } + {r−1

12 }τ ,

(C1)

and the integrals are now spin-dependent as indicated by the square brackets [· · · ] [5].
Denoting the one-body portion of H by { ˆFτ }, is appropriate, since this term is the Fock-

operator, except that the second quantized operators are normal-ordered with respect to
the |τ i vacuum state, instead of the true vacuum | i, as in ˆFτ . The two body portion of H
12 }τ emphasizing that this operator is determined by r−1
is denoted by {r−1
12 and the vacuum
state |τ i; furthermore, except for the shifted vacuum, the two-body portion of H is r−1
12 ,

when this operator is expressed in second quantization.

For a perturbative treatment, we partition the Hamiltonian into a zeroth-order Hamilto-

nian H0 and a perturbation V :

where we require the reference state |τ i to be an eigenfunction of H0, a one-body operator:

ij
X
and the zeroth-order Hamiltonian is deﬁned by its matrix elements; we choose them by

requiring the following relation to be satisﬁed:

A linked diagram expansion for χτ and Eco[τ ] is known to exist for a zeroth-order Hamil-

Xw,x∈{ψo→τ }

tonian that is a diagonal, one-body, operator [24, 29, 41, 50, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56]. A diagonal

form for our one-body operator, H τ

0 , is obtained when we choose its orbital sets – {ψo→ τ }

and {ψu→ τ } – to satisfy the following conditions:

where we denote these particular sets of orbitals by {ψo← τ, ˆf τ
that they are uniquely determined by |τ i and their one-particle operator, ˆf τ

o } and {ψu← τ, ˆf τ

Using these orbitals, H τ

0 can be written as

where these terms – ˆoτ and ˆuτ – are the occupied and unoccupied portions of H τ
and (H τ

Note that the ﬁrst-order and the correlation energies, E1[τ ] and Eco, do not depend the

The perturbation Vτ , deﬁned by Eqs. (C13), can also be written in normal-ordered form:

where, from Eqs. (C1), and (C14), the individual terms are given by the following expres-

sions:

The one- and two-body parts of H, { ˆFτ } and {r−1

The one-body part of the perturbation V τ

1 is usually represented by a single diagrammatic
operator. However, for our purposes, it is convenient to use separate diagrammatic operators
for the three terms on the right side of Eq. (C18b), where { ˆFτ } is presented by Eq. (C19a).

Since the other two terms are diagonal, it is appropriate to simply represent them as unﬁlled

arrows:

−{ˆoτ } =

−ˆuτ =

(C20a)

In contrast, hole- and particle-lines, by themselves, are represented by ﬁlled arrows: and .

As a slight alternative to the usual approach to evaluate the diagrams of the correlation

energy Eco and the correlation operator χτ [5, 24, 29, 50, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56], we associate
an internal hole-line corresponding to a w-occupied orbital with a ψw(x1)ψ∗
we associate a particle line corresponding to an r-unoccupied orbital with a ψr(x2)ψ∗

w(x2) factor;
r (x1)
factor, where x1 and x2 denote the dummy integration variables that arise from the vertices.
Using this convention, the sole diagram involving the Fock operator ˆFτ from second-order

perturbation theory can be evaluated in the following manner:

= (ετ

rw)−1

d x1 d x2

ˆFτ 1τw(x1, x2)

(C21)

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

rw = ǫτ
ετ

w − ǫτ
r,

(C22)

and the repeated indices – r and w – are summed over; ˆFτ i denotes the Fock operator ˆFτ –
given by Eq. (41) – acting upon (xi); the term ( ˆFτ i · · · )· indicates that ˆFτ i exclusively acts

within the brackets; furthermore, the wth component of the (one-particle) density-matrix τ

where

is denoted by

the rth orthogonal-component of τ is denoted by

τw(x1, x2) = ψw(x1)ψ∗

w(x2);

τr(x1, x2) = ψr(x1)ψ∗

r (x2),

where, for a complete set of orbital states, we have [55]

δ(x1 − x2) =

τw(x1, x2) +

τr(x1, x2),

(C24)

w
X

r
X

37

which is a shorthand notations for

δ(x1 − x2) = δ(r1 − r2)δω1ω2.

(C25)

If we remove the top interaction from the diagram given by Eq. (C21), we see that this

is a ﬁrst-order diagram that contributes to the one-body portion of the correlation operator

χτ [29, 38, 50]. Since the inﬁnite-order sum of all one-body diagrams for χτ must vanish

for a Bruckner orbital description, this diagram can be omitted from the expansion for the

correlation energy Eco However, we will still consider it as a simple example to illustrate our

approach and notation.

In order to further compress our notation, we use the convention that all repeated dummy
indices are integrated over and restrict the Fock operator ˆFτ i to exclusively act upon the
ﬁrst variable of any two-body function, i.e., ( ˆFτ iα′(xj, xi)α(xi, xj) = α′(xj, xi) ˆFτ iα(xi, xj));

Eq. (C21) can then be written as

= (ετ

rw)−1 ˆFτ 1τw(x1, x2) ˆFτ 2τr(x2, x1),

(C26a)

and the other two diagrams from second-order perturbation theory have the following forms:

=

(ετ

rwsx)−1r−1

(C26c)

where

ετ
rwsx = ετ

rw + ετ

sx.

(C27)

Let us also mention that when determining which dummy indices are repeated indices, it is

not necessary to count indices appearing within operators. So, for example, the indices x1

and x2 appear twice in Eq. (C26a), and not three times, since the dummy indices from the
Fock operators, i.e., ˆFτ 1 and ˆFτ 2, are not counted.

The diagonal terms arising from the zeroth-order Hamiltonian, given by −{ˆoτ } and −ˆuτ ,
and represented by Eqs. (C20), ﬁrst appear in third order. For example, the following two

38

2

diagrams can be obtained by inserting −{ˆoτ } and −ˆuτ into the diagram on the left side of
Eq. (C26a):

= −

(ετ

ˆFτ 1τw(x1, x2) ˆFτ 2τr(x2, x1),

=

(−ǫr)
rw)2
(ετ

ˆFτ 1τw(x1, x2) ˆFτ 2τr(x2, x1).

The hole-line operator {ˆoτ } generates an additional hole line when inserted into a diagram
and, therefore, a factor of −1 is included when diagram (C28a) is evaluated, where this

factor cancels the −1 factor from −ǫw. Since this type of cancellation always occurs, as an
alternative, we associate a factor of ǫw for {ˆoτ } insertions, and treat {ˆoτ } vertices as ones
that do not generate additional hole lines; ˆuτ is associated with a −ǫr factor. Keep in mind,

also, that these operators generate an additional energy-denominator factor, e.g., ετ

rw, when

inserted into a diagram.

The individual diagrams depend,

in part, on each of the τw components, given by

Eq. (C23a), and the orthogonal components τr, given by Eq. (C23b).

In addition, each

diagram depends on the set of orbital energies {ǫτ }, which are at our disposal. In order to

make each diagram an explicit functional of the one-particle density-matrix τ , given by

and its orthogonal component, κτ , given by

where κτ depends, explicitly, on τ :

κτ (x1, x2) =

τr(x1, x2),

δ(x1 − x2) = τ (x1, x2) + κτ (x1, x2),

we choose all occupied orbitals to be degenerate, with energy ǫτ

o; also, we choose all un-

occupied orbitals to be degenerate, with energy ǫτ

u. With these choices, the zeroth-order

Hamiltonian, given by Eqs. (C11) and (C12), becomes

and since this operator is invariant to a unitary transformation of occupied or unoccupied
orbitals, it no longer depends on ˆf τ

u – any set of orbitals deﬁning τ is appropriate –

It is easily proven that all perturbative orders, except for the zeroth-order, depend on the

orbital-energy diﬀerence ετ , given by

ετ = ǫτ

o − ǫτ
u,

H τ

0 = ετ ˆNτ ,

and not on the individual orbital-energies, ǫτ

o and ǫτ

u. Therefore, we can choose (ǫτ

u = 0),

and so our only parameter is ετ . With this choice we have

where ˆNτ is the number operator for the occupied orbitals,

ˆNτ =

waw,

Xw∈{ψo→τ }
and it gives the total number of occupied orbitals when acting on a single determinant. In

the one-particle Hilbert space, this operator is the projector for the occupied subspace –

spanned by {ψo→ τ } – or, the one-particle density-matrix operator:

ˆNτ =

|ψwihψw| = ˆτ .

Xw∈{ψo→τ }

Using the above two expressions, let us generalize the deﬁnition of ˆτ :

and write the zeroth-order Hamiltonian in a simpliﬁed form, given by

By normal-ordering this expression, we have

ˆτ =

where Nτ is the number of particles within |τ i, and from Eq. (C14), we get the following

identities:

E0[τ ] = ετ Nτ ,
{ˆoτ } = ετ {ˆτ },

ˆuτ = 0;

V τ
c = E1[τ ] − ετ Nτ ,
1 = { ˆFτ } − ετ {ˆτ }.
V τ

furthermore, our zero- and one-body portion of the perturbation, Eqs. (C18a) and (C18b),

have the following modiﬁed forms:

Eq. (C43) indicates that the unoccupied operator, ˆuτ , represented by Eq. (C20b), does
not appear in the expansion of the correlation-energy Eco; {ˆoτ }, represented by Eq. (C20a)
and given by ετ {ˆτ }, is associated with a factor of ετ . Each diagram now becomes an explicit

functional of τ and κτ . For example, the second-order diagrams can be written in the

following manner:

where κτ is given by Eq. (C31). Higher order examples are presented elsewhere [30] and, in

addition, a method that yields diagrams for the correlation-energy Eco that explicitly depend

on the one particle density-matrix, τ .

It is well known that the correlation operator χτ is given by a linked-diagram expansion,

where all disconnected pieces are open [29, 38, 50]. Using our approach here, these diagrams

but that diagram is evaluated slighly diﬀerent, since there is no energy denominator associ-

ated with H.)

Abstract

We present a new, mathematically rigorous, method suitable for bound state
and scattering processes calculations for various three atomic or molecular
systems where the underlying forces are of a hard-core nature. We employed
this method to calculate the binding energies and the ultra-low energy scat-
tering phase shifts below as well as above the break-up threshold for the three
He-atom system. The method is proved to be highly successful and suitable
for solving the three-body bound state and scattering problem in conﬁguration
space and thus it paves the way to study various three-atomic systems, and to
calculate important quantities such as the cross-sections, recombination rates
etc.

The 4He trimer is of interest in various areas of Physical Chemistry and Molecular
Physics, in particular such as the behavior of atomic clusters under collisions and Bose-
Einstein condensation. Various theoretical and experimental works have been devoted in
the past to study its ground state properties and in general the properties of the 4He and
other noble gas droplets. From the theoretical works we mention here those using Variational
and Monte Carlo type methods [1–5], the Faddeev equations [6–8], and the hyperspherical
approach [9–11]. From the experimental works we recall those of Refs. [12–15] where molec-
ular clusters consisting of a small number of noble gas atoms were investigated.

Despite the eﬀorts made to solve the He-trimer problem various questions such as the
existence of Eﬁmov states and the study of scattering processes at ultra-low energies still have
not been satisfactorily addressed. In particular for scattering processes there are no works
which we are aware of apart from a recent study concerning recombination rates [16]. There
are various reasons for this the main one being the fact that the three-body calculations

involved are extremely diﬃcult to perform due to the practically hard–core of the inter–
atomic potential which gives rise to strong numerical inaccuracies that make calculations
for these molecules cumbersome and unstable.

In the present work we employed a hard core version of the Boundary Condition Model
(BCM) [17,18], developed in [19], [20]. The so-called hard-core potentials represent a partic-
ular variant of the BCM where one requires that the wave function vanishes when particles
approach each other at a certain distance r = c. Such a requirement is equivalent to an
c. The
introduction of an inﬁnitely strong repulsion between particles at distances r
standard formalism for scattering (see, for example, [21]) does not deal with hard-core in-
teractions described by these boundary conditions. Replacement of the ﬁnite, for r > 0, but
often singular at r = 0, repulsive short-range part of the potential with a hard-core inter-
action turns out to be a very eﬀective way to suppress inaccuracies related to a numerical
approximation of the Schr¨odinger operator at short distances.

In order to outline our method we start from the Schr¨odinger equation for bound states,
HΨ = EΨ , where Ψ is the three-body bound state wave function. We are concerned with
states for which E < 0 and that these energies are below the threshold of the continuous
spectrum of H. Using the Green’s formula [22] one can show that the function Ψ satisﬁes
the following Lippmann-Schwinger type equation

Ψ(X) =

We employed the Faddeev equations (5) and the hard-core, (8), and asymptotic, (9,10),
boundary conditions to calculate the binding energies of the Helium atomic trimer and the
ultra–low energy phase shifts of the Helium atom scattered oﬀ the Helium diatomic molecule.
In our calculations we take ~2/m = 12.12 K ˚A2. As a 4He–4He interatomic interactions we
use the HFDHE2 [25] and HFD-B [26] potentials of Aziz and co-workers which, we found,
1.6854 mK respectively. At
that they sustain a dimer bound state at

the same time the 4He atom–4He atom scattering length was found to be 124.7 ˚A for the
HFDHE2 and 88.6 ˚A for the HFD-B potential.

In the present work we restrict ourselves to calculations for S-state only. The partial
components Φlλ0 can be obtained in this case from the addition of even partial waves l and λ
with l = λ. The results of the Helium trimer ground-state energy calculations are presented
in Table I. Although the two potentials used diﬀer only slightly, they produce important
diﬀerences in the ground-state energy. This is in agreement with the ﬁnding of Ref. [10]
but in disagreement with the statement made in Ref. [5]. It should be further noted that
most of the contribution to the binding energy stems from the l = λ = 0 and l = λ = 2
partial component the latter being more than 35 %. The contribution from the l = λ = 4
partial wave was shown in [8] to be of the order of a few per cent. We have found that the
Helium trimer can form an excited state with both the HFDHE2 and HFD-B potentials in
agreement with the ﬁndings of Refs. [6,7,11]. Note that in the papers [7,11] this state is
interpreted as an Eﬁmov one [27]. Our excited state results are given in Table II.

The phase shift δ0(E) results, for a Helium atom scattered oﬀ a Helium dimer at L = 0,
are given in Table III. We considered incident energies below as well as above the breakup
threshold, i.e., for the (2 + 1
1 + 1 + 1) processes. It is seen
2 + 1) and the (2 + 1
that, similarly to the bound state results, the inclusion of the l = λ = 2 partial wave is
essential to describe the scattering correctly.

Our estimation for the scattering length, based on the phase shift results, with the HFD-

by Nakaichi-Maeda and Lim [6] via zero-energy scattering calculations and by employing a
separable approximation for the HFDHE2 potential.

The results obtained with two realistic 4He–4He potentials clearly demonstrate the reli-
ability of our method in three-body bound state and scattering calculations. The eﬀectively
hard-core inter-atomic potential together with other characteristics of the system, make such
calculations extremely tedious and numerically unstable. The numerical advantage of our
approach is already obvious from the structure of Eqs. (3): When a potential with a strong
repulsive core is replaced with the hard-core model, one approximates, inside the core do-
mains, only the Laplacian
∆X, instead of the sum of the Laplacian and a huge repulsive
term, and in this way a much better numerical approximation can be achieved. Thus the
present formalism paves the way to study various three-atomic systems, and to calculate
important quantities such as the cross-sections, recombination rates etc.

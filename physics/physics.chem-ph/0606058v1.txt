The eﬀect of solvation on ET rate processes is investigated on the basis of the exact theory
constructed in J. Phys. Chem. B 110, xxx (2006). The nature of solvation is studied in a close
relation with the mechanism of ET processes. The resulting Kramers’ turnover and Marcus’ inversion
characteristics are analyzed accordingly. The classical picture of solvation is found to be invalid when
the solvent longitudinal relaxation time is short compared with the inverse temperature.

INTRODUCTION

Chemical reaction in condensed phases is intimately
related to the Brownian motion in solution. Einstein’s
paper on Brownian motion1 showed the ﬁrst time the
ﬂuctuation-dissipation relation (FDR). The ﬂuctuations
of surrounding molecules are responsible for both ag-
itation and friction on the Brownian particle. These
stochastic events of energy exchange between system and
bath lead eventually to thermal equilibrium. Brownian
motion is characterized by the stochastic force. The FDR
leads to a Fokker-Planck equation, which is the classical
reduced equation of motion that governs the Brownian
motion at an ensemble average level. This approach has
been exploited by Kramers in his construction of iso-
merization reaction rate theory.2 The resulting rate is
shown to have a maximum in an intermediate viscos-
ity region. This celebrated Kramers’ turnover behavior
clearly demonstrates the dual role of solvent on reaction
rate.2,3

it is
often treated in diﬀerent way from the traditional chem-
ical reaction involving bond breaking and/or formation.
In the latter case, either the equation of motion for a
particle over the barrier or the ﬂux-ﬂux correlation func-
tion approach on the basis of the transition-state the-
ory is used.3,21,22,23 The standard treatment in the ET
research ﬁeld is rather a type of transfer coupling cor-
relation function formalism, based on the assumption
that the nonadiabatic coupling matrix element V is not
strong.4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20

Depicted in Fig. 1 is the schematics of an elementary
donor-acceptor ET system. Here, E◦ denotes the re-
action endothermicity; Va (Vb) represents the potential
surface of the solvent environment for the electron in the
donor (acceptor) state; U ≡ Vb − Va − E◦ is the solvation
coordinate; while λ ≡ hU i is the solvation energy, with
h· · ·i denoting the initial bath ensemble average. At the

crossing (U + E◦ = 0) point, Va = Vb = (E◦ + λ)2/(4λ)
that amounts to the ET reaction barrier height. The

It is a classical Franck-Condon theory, assuming that the
solvent relaxation is much slow compared with the elec-
tronic transition. Exploited in Eq. (1) is also the classical
FDR: hU 2i − hU i2 = 2kBT hU i. Quantum extension of
Marcus’ theory has been formulated in the weak trans-
fer coupling regime.19,20 The dynamic solvation eﬀect is
introduced by the solvation correlation function,

C(t) = hU (t)U (0)i − hU i2.

(2)

Nonperturbative rates have also been formulated on
the basis of
fourth-order transfer correlation func-
tions, followed by certain resummation schemes to par-
tially account for the nonperturbative transfer coupling
eﬀects.9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18 The resulting rates, despite
of the resummation approximation involved, do recover
the celebrated Kramers’ turnover behavior.

The main purpose of this work is to elucidate some
distinct solvation eﬀects on the ET rate processes. The
quantum nature of solvation arises from the fact that the
solvation coordinate is an operator and its correlation
function must be complex. The elementary ET system in
Debye solvents will be studied on the basis of the exact
and analytical rate theory developed in Ref. 24, which
will be referred as Paper I hereafter. Section II sum-
marizes the theoretical results of Paper I. This is a re-
duced quantum equation of motion based formalism; i.e.,
the quantum version of Kramers’ Fokker-Planck equation
approach. The key quantity now is the reduced density
matrix, ρ(t) = trBρT, deﬁned as the trace of the total
system-bath density matrix over the bath subspace. Nu-
merical results will be presented and discussed in Sec. III.
Finally, Sec. IV concludes this paper.

II. AN EXACT AND ANALYTICAL THEORY

This section summarizes the exact and analytical rate
theory, developed in Paper I, for the ET in Debye solvents
at ﬁnite temperatures. Let us start with the following
form of the reduced Liouville equation,

˙ρ(t) = −

dτ ˆΠ(t, τ )ρ(τ ).

(3)

For the present ET system (Fig. 1), the reduced system
Hamiltonian reads

with

H = (E

+ λ)|bihb| + V (|aihb| + |biha|).

(4)

◦

This is a time-independent system, for which the dissi-
pation memory kernel ˆΠ(t, τ ) = ˆΠ(t − τ ). As a result,
Eq. (3) can be resolved in its Laplace domain as

s˜ρ(s) − ρ(0) = −i L˜ρ(s) − Π(s)˜ρ(s).

(5)

Here  L ≡ ~−1[H, •] is the reduced system Liouvillian.

A simpliﬁcation arises for the ET system in Debye sol-
vents at ﬁnite temperature. The solvation correlation
function assumes now (for t > 0)

C(t) = λ(2kBT − i~γ)e

−γt ≡ ~2ηe

−t/τL.

(6)

Here, τL ≡ γ−1 denotes the longitudinal relaxation time
of the Debye solvent. In this case, Eq. (5) can be for-
mulated exactly in terms of a continued fraction Green’s
function formalism. Let Π(s) ≡ Π(0)(s) and

G(n)(s) ≡

1
s + i L + Π(n)(s)

; n ≥ 0.

(7)

The continued fraction hierarchy is now the relation be-
tween Π(n)(s) and G(n+1)(s + γ); cf. the eq (16) of Pa-
per I. For the elementary ET system subject to the De-
bye longitudinal relaxation, it is found that Π(n), which
is Hermite satisfying Π(n)
j′j,k′k, has only three
nonzero tensor elements together with their complex con-
jugates. Denote the three nonzero tensor elements of Π(n)
as

jj′,kk′ = Π(n) ∗

x ≡ Πba,ba, y ≡ Πba,ab, z ≡ Πba,bb.

Implied here, and also whenever applicable hereafter [cf.
Eqs. (10a)–(11b)], are the superscript index (n) and ar-
gument s, if they are the same in the both sides of the
individual equation; otherwise they will be speciﬁed. The
continued fraction hierarchy that relates Π(n)(s) with
G(n+1)(s + γ) can now be expressed in terms of

x(n)(s) = η(n + 1)X (n+1)(s + γ),
y(n)(s) = −η
z(n)(s) = (η − η

(n + 1)Y (n+1)(s + γ),

The kinetics rate equation can be readily obtained via
Eq. (5) by eliminating the oﬀ-diagonal reduced density
matrix elements. It leads to a linear algebraic equation in
the Laplace domain that corresponds to the generalized
rate equation with memory rate kernels in time domain.
The resulting ET rate resolution reads as [the eq (36a)
of Paper I]

k(s) =

2|V |2
~2 Re

α(s) + y(s)
|α(s)|2 − |y(s)|2 .

(12)

The rate constant k ≡ k(0) that will be numerically stud-
ied in the next section amounts to the time integral of
the memory rate kernel in the aforementioned generalized
rate equation.

As analyzed in Paper I, the inﬁnity inverse recursive
formalism [Eqs. (9) and (10)] can be truncated by set-
ting {x, y, z}(N ) = 0 at a suﬃciently large anchoring N .
The resulting {x, y, z}(0) ≡ {x, y, z} that are required
by Eq. (12) are exact up to the (2N )th-order in the
system-bath coupling. The convergence is guaranteed
also via the mathematical continued fraction structure
involved. Apparently, if the rates are needed at a speci-
ﬁed s′, one shall start with {x, y, z}(N )
s=s′+N γ = 0. The
backward-recursion relations, Eqs. (9) with Eqs. (10),
will then lead to {x, y, z}(N −1)
s=s′+(N −1)γ, and so on, until
{x, y, z}(0)
s=s′ ≡ {x, y, z}s=s′ are reached for evaluating the
required k(s′) [Eq. (12)]. The above reduced dynamics-
based ET rate formalism is exact for the Debye solvents
in ﬁnite temperatures. However, the FDR, which relates
the real and imaginary parts of the solvation correlation
function, is adopted in Eq. (6) in a semiclassical manner.
As a consequence the reduced density matrix and rates
may become negative if the temperature is too low.

III. QUANTUM SOLVATION EFFECTS:
NUMERICAL RESULTS

Here, {X, Y, Z}(n)(s) are the counterpart tensor elements
of the Green’s function G(n)(s). Their relations to the

We are now in the position to elucidate some distinct
solvation eﬀects on the ET reaction rate k ≡ k(s = 0) [cf.
Eq. (12)]. Numerical results will be presented in relation

to the celebrated Kramers’ turnover and Marcus’ inver-
sion behaviors, exempliﬁed with the ET reaction systems
of V = 1 kJ/mol and λ = 3 kJ/mol at T = 298 K.

It is noticed that the solvation longitudinal relax-
ation time τL is considered proportional to the solvent
viscosity.16,17 The Kramers’ turnover characteristics can
therefore be demonstrated in terms of the rate k as a
function of the scaled solvent relaxation time τL/τther.
Here, τther ≡ ~/(kBT ) denotes the thermal time, which
at the room temperature is about 26 fs. In the Debye sol-
vent model of Eq. (6), the quantum nature of solvation
enters via the semiclassical FDR that relates the real and
imaginary parts of the correlation function. In contrast,
the classical solvation is characterized by the real part
only. As Im η/Re η = −0.5τther/τL, it is anticipated that
the quantum nature of solvation can only be prominent
in the low viscosity (τL < τther) regime. It is also con-
sistent with the physical picture that the high viscosity
(or slow motion) implies a large eﬀective mass and thus
leads to the classical solvation limit.

Figure 2 depicts the rates k as functions of τL/τther for
two typical systems, being of the endothermicity values of
E◦ = −λ and E◦ = 0, respectively. Observed in the high
viscosity (τL/τther > 1) regime for each of the systems is
the celebrated Kramers’ fall-oﬀ behavior.2,3 This is the
well established classical solvation picture of the diﬀu-
sion limit: the higher the solvent viscosity is, the more
backscattering (or barrier-recrossing) events will be. The
fact that kE◦=−λ > kE◦=0 observed in the high viscos-
ity regime is also anticipated from the classical solvation
picture [cf. Fig. 1 or Eq. (1)]: That E◦ = −λ represents a
classical barrierless system where the celebrated Marcus’
inversion takes place.

In the low viscosity (τL/τther < 1) regime the clas-
sical picture of solvation is however invalid. The ob-
served rate in the symmetric (E◦ = 0) system, is appar-
ently tunneling dominated due to Fermi resonance. The
most striking observation is that the so called barrierless
(E◦ = −λ) system exhibits now clearly the Kramers’
viscosity-assisted barrier-crossing characteristics in the
low viscosity regime. This suggests that there is an eﬀec-
tive barrier for the ET system with the classical barrier-
less value of E◦ + λ = 0; this eﬀective barrier is viscosity
dependent and vanishes as τL increases.

Now turn to the Marcus’ inversion characteristics for
the rate k as a function of reaction endothermicity E◦.
Depicted in Fig. 3 are the resulting inversion curves, with
τL/τther = 0.1, 1, and 10 to represent the low (solid-
curve), intermediate (dot-curve), and high (dash-curve)
viscosity regimes, respectively. In the classical solvation
picture the inversion occurs at E◦ = −λ, as it represents

3

a classical barrierless system. This picture is only valid
in the high viscosity regime; see the dashed curve with
τL/τther = 10.

In the low viscosity regime, according to the analysis
presented for Fig. 2, there is always a nonzero barrier for
the ET reaction, covering over the entire range of E◦
including the value of E◦ = −λ. This explains the inver-
sion behavior of the solid curve in Fig. 3 that is peaked
only at the resonant position of E◦ = 0. As the viscosity
increases, the inversion region smoothly shifts from the
resonant peak position E◦ = 0 to the classical barrierless
position of E◦ = −λ.

To explain the asymmetric property of the inversion
behavior observed in Fig. 3, let us recall that k(−E◦)
amounts to the backward reaction rate and k(E◦) <
k(−E◦) for an endothermic (E◦ > 0) reaction. This
leads immediately to the asymmetric property of the solid
curve in Fig. 3, in which the blue (endothermic) wing falls
oﬀ faster than its red (exothermic) wing. The degree of
asymmetry decreases as the viscosity increases. Only in
the high viscosity regime does the inversion curve behave
classically, which is symmetric (but may not be parabolic
unless the transfer coupling V is small) around its clas-
sical inversion position of E◦ = −λ.

IV. SUMMARY

In summary, we have investigated in detail the eﬀect
of solvation on ET rate processes. The nature of solva-
tion is studied in a close relation with the mechanism of
ET processes in terms of Kramers’ turnover and Marcus’
inversion characteristics. The classical picture of solva-
tion is found to be invalid in the low viscosity regime,
which can be well measured by the scaled longitudinal
relaxation time of τL/τther, where τther = ~/(kBT ) is the
thermal time. The present study is carried out on the
basis of the exact rate theory for the simplest ET system
with a single solvation relaxation time scale. Neverthe-
less, the basic results obtained here are expected to be
valid to a general ET system in a realistic solvent envi-
ronment of multiple relaxation time scales.

Abstract

K+(aq) ion is an integral component of many cellular processes, amongst which the most important,

perhaps, is its role in transmitting electrical impulses along the nerve. Understanding its hydration

structure and thermodynamics is crucial in dissecting its role in such processes. Here we address

these questions using both the statistical mechanical quasi-chemical theory of solutions and ab

initio molecular dynamics simulations. Simulations predict an interesting hydration structure for

K+(aq): the population of about six (6) water molecules within the initial minimum of the observed

gKO(r) at inﬁnite dilution involves four (4) inner-most molecules that the quasi-chemical theory

suggests should be taken as the theoretical inner shell. The contribution of the 5th and 6th closest

water molecules is observable as a distinct shoulder on the principal maximum of the gKO(r). The

quasi-chemical estimate of solvation free energy for the neutral pair KOH is also in good agreement

with experiments.

INTRODUCTION

Many of the most characteristic molecular processes in aqueous solutions, including bio-

physical processes, depend upon electrolytic properties of these phases. Molecular scale

understanding of the statistical thermodynamics of ionic species in water is important for

understanding those processes. Both theory and simulation of these systems has become

much more revealing in recent years. As successive cases of common ions are addressed

with more informative tools [1], idiosyncratic diﬀerences between chemically similar ions,

for example, the alkali metals, come to the forefront. This paper considers K+(aq) in detail,

and studies an intrinsic diﬀerence from the cases of Li+(aq) and Na+(aq); speciﬁcally, the

deﬁnition on the basis of theory and simulation observation of an inner hydration shell.

A satisfactory identiﬁcation of an inner shell makes molecular theory and other subsequent

considerations much simpler. For Li+(aq) [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] and Na+(aq) [8, 9], such an

inner shell is obvious from the most primitive observation, the radial distribution of water

(oxygens) conditional on the atomic ion. For K+(aq) that identiﬁcation is less trivial, but

that is the goal of this note. This is likely to be an issue of broader relevance to other ions
in solution, for example, HO−(aq) [10, 11].

The more revealing tools hinted at above are ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) and

the quasi-chemical theory of solutions. K+(aq) at high dilution has been the subject of a

preliminary AIMD calculation [12]. In contrast, a recent simulation study focused on inﬁnite

dilution hydration free energies utilizing classical force ﬁeld models [13]. Concentrated KOH

aqueous solutions have been studied by Car-Parrinello ab initio molecular dynamics methods,

too [14, 15]. A more expansive molecular dynamics study of KF aqueous solution on the

basis of a classical model force ﬁeld is presented in [16].

II. AB INITIO MOLECULAR DYNAMICS

The K+(aq) model system consisted of 32 water molecules and one K+ ion contained
in a cubic box of length 9.865 ˚A and subjected to periodic boundary conditions. With

this box volume, the water density in the system matched the experimental density of bulk

liquid water at standard conditions, with no alterations made for the presence of the ion.

A structure obtained from a well-equilibrated system used in a previous study of Na+(aq)

2

[9] provided a template for generating initial conﬁgurations for the current investigation.

The sodium ion and 8 nearest water molecules were removed from the former system and

replaced with a cluster composed of 8 water molecules surrounding a K+ ion. The geometry

of the inserted K+ cluster was ﬁrst optimized in a separate ab initio calculation and, when

placed in the simulation box, the cluster became 10-fold coordinated due to the proximity

of two other water molecules in the box.

It is the dynamical evolution of this initial conﬁguration, determined within an ab initio

framework, that is presented and analyzed here. Alternative initial conﬁgurations generated

in an analogous manner using 6 and 9 water molecules were used to conﬁrm that the results

were independent of initial conditions, but will not be addressed further.

Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations based on the PW91 gradient-corrected electron

density functional description of the electronic structure and interatomic forces were per-

formed on the K+(aq) system using the VASP program [17, 18]. Valence electrons, which

included the semi-core 3p states of K, were treated explicitly, while Vanderbilt [19, 20] ultra-

soft pseudopotentials described core-valence interactions for all atoms. The valence orbitals

were expanded in plane waves with a kinetic energy cut-oﬀ of 29.1 Ry, and the equations of

motion were integrated in time steps of 1.0 fs for a total simulation time of 20 ps.

For the ﬁrst 3 ps of the AIMD simulations, a constant temperature of 300 K is main-

tained by scaling the velocities. During this time, the K+ immediately sheds half of its 10

coordinating water molecules by expanding into a more relaxed geometry with fewer water

ligands, see Fig. 1. When the temperature constraint is removed, the system heats up a

little and the number of coordinating water molecules ﬂuctuates between four (4) and eight

(8). Note that it takes more than 4 ps for the system temperature to stabilize around a new

average value. The structural analyses presented here utilize the simulation data collected
between 10 and 20 ps, for which the system temperature averages 340±23 K.

III. QUASI-CHEMICAL THEORY

The discussion of the quasi-chemical approach [21], and its application to ion-solvation

problems (see, for example [2, 22]) has been considered in detail before. Brieﬂy, the region

around the solute of interest is partitioned into inner and outer shell domains. For K+(aq),

the inner shell comprises the water molecules directly coordinated with the ion. This domain

3

is treated quantum mechanically. The outer-shell contribution has been assessed using both

a dielectric continuum model and classical force ﬁeld simulations (see [22]). The theory

permits a variational check of the inner-outer partition [9, 23], but this aspect has not been

pursued here.

The inner shell reactions are:

K+ + nH2O ⇋ K[H2O]n

+

The free energy change for these reactions were calculated using the Gaussian programs [24].
The K · [H2O]n

+ (n = 0. . . 8) clusters were geometry optimized in the gas phase using the

B3LYP hybrid density functional [25] and the 6-31+G(d,p) basis set. Frequency calculations

conﬁrmed a true minimum, and the zero point energies were computed at the same level of

theory. Single point energies were calculated with the 6-311+G(2d,p) basis.

For estimating the outer shell contribution, the ChelpG method [26] was used to obtain

partial atomic charges. Then the hydration free energies of the clusters were calculated using

a dielectric continuum model [27], with the radii set developed by Stefanovich et al. [28] and

surface tessera generated according to Ref. [29]. With this information and the binding free

energies for the chemical reactions, a primitive quasi-chemical approximation to the excess

chemical potential of K+(aq) in water is:

is the equilibrium constant for the

reaction in an ideal gas state, n is the hydration number of the most stable inner shell cluster,

and β = 1/kBT. The density factor ρH2O appearing in Eq. 3.1 reﬂects the actual density of
liquid water and its eﬀect is included by the replacement contribution of −nkBT ln(ρH2O/ρ0)
= -nkBT ln(1354), where ρH2O = 1 gm/cm3, and ρ0 = 1 atm/RT . (Discussions on standard

states and this replacement contribution can be found in Pratt and Rempe [2] and Grabowski

et al. [30].) Note that it is in forming Eq. 3.1 that approximations enter the theory, but all

these approximations are available for scrutiny and improvement.

Following this procedure, the most probable inner-shell coordination number was found

to be four (4). Based on this identiﬁcation, we pursued more reﬁned molecular dynamics

calculations to assess the outer-shell contribution using the K[H2O]4

+ cluster. The oxygen

4

and hydrogen atoms of the cluster were assigned the van der Waals parameters of the

classical SPC/E [31] water model. The ChelpG charges were retained for the cluster. This

cluster was placed in a bath of 306 SPC/E water molecules and its hydration free energy

calculated in the same manner as described in [22]. In contrast to this earlier study, only

one box size was used. This was founded on the earlier observation that using diﬀerent box

dimensions did not change the hydration free energy much, indicating that ion(aq) ﬁnite

size eﬀects are modest. More expansive discussions of outer shell contributions can be found

in [2, 21, 23, 32]

IV. RESULTS

A. Ab initio molecular dynamics

Fig. 2 shows the radial density distribution of the water oxygen atoms around the ion,
obtained by analyzing the last 10 ps of the simulation using a bin width of 0.1 ˚A. The

density of water peaks at only a little over 2.5 times the density of bulk water and the
ﬁrst coordination shell is characterized by a broad ﬁrst peak spanning over 1 ˚A in width

with a shallow ill-deﬁned minimum, in contrast to the much narrower and better deﬁned

distributions of water around the smaller alkali metal cations, Li+ and Na+ [1]. The area
under the ﬁrst peak indicates that the mean number of 5.9±0.9 water molecules coordinate
the ion within a distance of r=3.50 ˚A. Of more interest is the secondary structure appearing

in the ﬁrst peak, indicating a composite nature of the water distributed around potassium

ion.

The analysis of Fig. 2 suggests that the ﬁrst coordination shell is actually composed of

two sub populations of water molecules, with one subset occupying the region closest to

the ion and the other subset situated at a slightly larger distance. In Fig.2, contributions

to the radial density distribution of the four (4) water molecules nearest the K+ ion and

the next two (2) water molecules have been separated out from the full distribution. Two

overlapping, but distinct populations of water molecules are apparent. Note that for r =
3 ˚A where a shoulder appears on the far slope of the principal maximum in g(r), the mean

occupancy is about four (4). This contrasts to the mean occupancy of six (6) in the inner

hydration shell given by the conventional deﬁnition above, where the ﬁrst minimum in g(r)

5

establishes identiﬁcation of the inner population.

In the analysis presented next, quasi-chemical theory establishes four (4) as the most

probable inner occupancy, in agreement with the ﬁrst subpopulation identiﬁed in the pre-

ceding analysis of the dynamical data, and on that basis a quasi-chemical analysis provides

a good estimate of the absolute hydration free energy.

Previous simulation results agree qualitatively with Fig. 2, but diﬀerences in resolution

[12], or concentration [14, 15, 16] preclude a more detailed comparison.

B. Quasi-chemical calculations

The hydration free energy of K+, using the classical molecular dynamics calculation
for the outer-shell contribution, is −70.5 ± 2.1 kcal/mole for transfer of the solute from

1 mol (ideal gas) to 1 mol (ideally diluted solute) solution. The experimental values are

suitably adjusted to account for this choice of standard state. As found before [22], the

agreement between our absolute hydration free energies and the values of Coe and coworkers
[33] (−86 kcal/mole) is poor. The sign and magnitude of this discrepancy is in line with

discrepancies already identiﬁed for H+, Li+, and Na+ and further validates our suggestion

that the absolute hydration free energies [22] estimated by Coe and coworkers contain a

negative contribution from the potential of the phase.

Nevertheless, solvation free energies of neutral combinations, such as KOH, are thermody-

namically unambiguous and can be accessed experimentally. With the hydration free energy
of HO−, −123.8 kcal/mole, computed earlier [22] using the SPC/E model for the outer-shell
contribution, the hydration free energy of the neutral combination KOH is −194.3 ± 2.1.
This is in good agreement with the experimental value of −191 kcal/mole by Coe et al.,

adjusted for our choice of standard states.

We note that for the hydration of HO−(aq), the quasi-component was the tri-hydrated
−. This choice was conﬁrmed by both ab initio molecular dynamics [11] and

state HO[H2O]3

quasi-chemical calculations [10].

V. CONCLUSIONS

Primitive quasi-chemical theory identiﬁes four (4) as the most probable water/oxygen

occupancy of a chemically deﬁned inner shell for the K+(aq) at inﬁnite dilution. On this

basis, that quasi-chemical theory gives a good estimate of the absolute hydration free energy

of K+(aq). These results are consistent with AIMD observations, but the inner shell is less

clearly deﬁned by observation of gKO(r) only. In particular, the ﬁrst minimum of gKO(r)

is shallow, and the principal maximum shows a distinct shoulder that delineates a second

population of two water molecules beyond the inner-most four water molecules. That second

set overlaps an anticipated ﬁrst minimum region. These features are distinctly diﬀerent for

the corresponding results for Li+(aq) and, to a lesser degree, Na+(aq).

Excited states of the hydrogen molecule subject to a homogeneous magnetic ﬁeld are investigated
for the parallel conﬁguration in the complete regime of ﬁeld strengths B = 0 − 100a.u.. Up to seven
excitations are studied for gerade as well as ungerade spin singlet states of Σ symmetry with a high
accuracy. The evolution of the potential energy curves for the individual states with increasing
ﬁeld strength as well as the overall behaviour of the spectrum are discussed in detail. A variety of
phenomena like for example the sequence of changes for the dissociation channels of excited states
and the resulting formation of outer wells are encountered. Possible applications of the obtained
data to the analysis of magnetic white dwarfs are outlined.

I. INTRODUCTION

Matter which is exposed to strong external magnetic ﬁelds changes its basic properties and structure and leads
to a variety of new phenomena. As a result strong ﬁelds are of importance in diﬀerent branches of physics like
atomic, molecular or solid state physics. For atomic and molecular systems there are two prominent possibilities to
encounter the strong ﬁeld regime: highly excited Rydberg states in the laboratory and atoms and molecules in the
atmospheres of magnetized white dwarfs (see refs. [1–3] for a compilation of the subject). From a theorists point of
view particle systems in strong ﬁelds pose a hard problem due to several competing interactions (Coulomb attraction
and repulsion, para- and diamagnetic interactions). Of particular interest, but most complicated to investigate, is
hereby the so-called intermediate regime which is characterized by comparable magnetic and Coulomb binding forces.
Focusing on the low-lying states of atoms and molecules we envisage this regime for those magnetic white dwarfs
which possess ﬁeld strengths in the regime 103 − 105T . Each magnetic white dwarf possesses a characteristic regime
of ﬁeld strengths which varies, in case of a dipole, by a factor of two from the pole to the equator. To perform
a ﬁrst identiﬁcation of observed spectra from the atmospheres of these objects one uses the so-called stationary
line spectroscopy: characteristic absorption features can appear only for those wavelengths which correspond to
an extremum of the transition wavelength with respect to the ﬁeld strength. In a second step one then performs
simulations of the radiation transport in the atmosphere in order to obtain synthetic spectra. In the eighties the
above approaches have been used to identify hydrogen in a number of magnetized white dwarfs [4–7]. Recently the
stationary line argument has been successfully [8] used to obtain strong evidence for helium in the spectrum of the
magnetic white dwarf GD229 whose absorption features have been mysterious ever since its discovery 25 years ago.
This was only possible due to the enormous progress achieved with respect to our knowledge of the spectrum and
transitions of the helium atom in strong magnetic ﬁelds [9, 10]. However, this should not obscur the fact that there
are a number of magnetic white dwarfs whose spectra remain unexplained and furthermore new magnetic objects
are discovered (see, for example, Reimers et al [11] in the course of the Hamburg survey of the European Southern
Observatory (ESO)). Very recently strong candidates for quasimolecular absorption features have been discovered
in magnetized white dwarfs [12]. This raises the demand for a theoretical investigation of molecular properties, in
particular of the hydrogen molecule, in such strong ﬁelds.

Several theoretical investigations were performed for molecular systems in strong magnetic ﬁelds. Most of them
deal with the electronic structure of the H +
2 ion (see refs. [13–19] and references therein). Very interesting phenomena
can be observed already for this simple diatomic system. For the ground state of the H +
2 molecule the dissociation
energy increases and the equilibrium internuclear distance simultaneously decreases with increasing ﬁeld strength.
Furthermore it was shown [18, 19] that a certain class of excited electronic states, which possess a purely repulsive
potential energy surface in the absence of a magnetic ﬁeld, acquire a well-pronounced potential well in a suﬃciently
strong magnetic ﬁeld. Moreover the electronic potential energies depend not only on the internuclear distance but also
on the angle between the magnetic ﬁeld and the molecular axis which leads to a very complex topological behavior of
the corresponding potential energy surfaces [14–16].

In contrast to the H +

2 ion there exist only a few investigations dealing with the electronic structure of the hydrogen

molecule in the presence of a strong magnetic ﬁeld. Highly excited states of H2 were studied for a ﬁeld strength
of 4.7 T in ref. [20]. For intermediate ﬁeld strengths two studies of almost qualitative character investigate the
potential energy curve (PEC) of the lowest 1Σg state [21, 22]. A few investigations were performed in the high ﬁeld
limit [23–26], where the magnetic forces dominate over the Coulomb forces and therefore several approximations can
be used. Very recently a ﬁrst step has been done in order to elucidate the electronic structure of the H2 molecule for
the parallel conﬁguration, i.e. for parallel internuclear and magnetic ﬁeld axes [27–30]. Hereby refs. [27, 28] apply an
exact, i.e. fully correlated approach, whereas refs. [29, 30] use Hartree-Fock calculations and focus exclusively on the
identiﬁcation of the global ground state of the molecule. In refs. [27, 28] the lowest states of the Σ and Π manifolds
were studied for gerade and ungerade parity as well as singlet and triplet spin symmetry. Hereby accurate adiabatic
electronic energies were obtained for a broad range of ﬁeld strengths from ﬁeld free space up to strong magnetic ﬁelds
of 100 a.u. A variety of interesting eﬀects were revealed. As in the case of the H +
2 ion, the lowest strongly bound
states of Σ symmetry, i.e. the lowest 1Σg , 3Σg and 1Σu state, show a decrease of the bond length and an increase of
the dissociation energy for suﬃciently strong ﬁelds. Furthermore a change in the dissociation channel occurs for the
lowest 1Σu state between B = 10.0 and 20.0 a.u. due to the existence of strongly bound H − states in the presence of
a magnetic ﬁeld. The 3Σg state was shown to exhibit an additional outer minimum for intermediate ﬁeld strengths
which could provide vibrationally bound states.

An important result of refs. [27, 29] is the change of the ground state from the lowest 1Σg state to the lowest 3Σu
state between B = 0.1 and 0.2 a.u. This crossing is of particular relevance for the binding properties of the global
ground state of the molecule: The 3Σu state is an unbound state and possesses only a very shallow van der Waals
minimum which does not support any vibrational level. Therefore, the global ground state of the hydrogen molecule
for the parallel conﬁguration is an unbound state for B >
∼ 0.2 a.u.. Furthermore it has been shown in ref. [25] that for
very strong ﬁelds (B >
∼ 3 × 103 a.u.) the strongly bound 3Πu state is the global ground state of the hydrogen molecule
oriented parallel to the magnetic ﬁeld. Finally the complete scenario for the crossovers of the global ground state of
the parallel conﬁguration has been clariﬁed in ref. [28] which contains the transition ﬁeld strengths for the crossings
among the lowest states of 1Σg,3 Σu and 3Πu symmetry.

The above considerations show that detailed studies of the electronic properties of the hydrogen molecule in a
magnetic ﬁeld are very desirable. The present investigation deals with the excited Σ states of the hydrogen molecule
in the parallel conﬁguration which is distinct by its higher symmetry [31]. We employ a full conﬁguration interaction
(CI) approach which is most suitable for obtaining detailed information on the electronic structure. Our investigation
is divided into two separate studies: the ﬁrst and present work focuses on singlet states of both gerade and ungerade
symmetry whereas a later investigation will focus on the corresponding triplet states again for both parities. Due
to the spin Zeeman splitting the spin singlet and triplet manifolds are increasingly separated with increasing ﬁeld
strength. The spin character provides therefore a natural dividing line of our extensive work which contains a large
amount of information and data on the behaviour of the excited states of the molecule. The results of our calculations
include accurate adiabatic PECs for the complete range of ﬁeld strengths 0 ≤ B ≤ 100 a.u.. Up to seven excited
states have been investigated for each symmetry. We present detailed data for the total and dissociation energies at
the equilibrium internuclear distances as well as the equilibrium positions themselves for the lowest three excitations
for each symmetry. Due to the large amount of data the evolution of the higher excited states with increasing ﬁeld
strength is presented only graphically. However, further informations like, for example, the positions of the maxima
and the accurate heights of the barriers or the complete data of the PEC’s as well as numerical data on the higher
excited states, more precisely, on the fourth up to the seventh excited state, can be obtained from the authors upon
request.

In detail the paper is organized as follows. In section II we describe the theoretical aspects of the present investiga-
tion, including a discussion of the Hamiltonian, a description of the atomic orbital basis set and some remarks on the
CI approach. Section III contains the results and an elaborate discussion of the evolution of the electronic structure
in the presence of the magnetic ﬁeld with increasing strength.

II. THEORETICAL ASPECTS

Our starting point is the total nonrelativistic molecular Hamiltonian in Cartesian coordinates. The total pseu-
domomentum is a constant of motion and therefore commutes with the Hamiltonian [32, 33]. For that reason the
Hamiltonian can be simpliﬁed by performing a so-called pseudoseparation of the center of mass motion [32, 34, 35]
which introduces the center of mass coordinate and the conserved pseudomomentum as a pair of canonical conjugated
variables. Further simpliﬁcations can be achieved by a consecutive series of unitary transformations [34, 35].

In order to separate the electronic and nuclear motion we perform the Born-Oppenheimer approximation in the
presence of a magnetic ﬁeld [34–36]. As a ﬁrst order approximation we assume inﬁnitely heavy masses for the nuclei.

The origin of our coordinate system coincides with the midpoint of the internuclear axis of the hydrogen molecule
and the protons are located on the z axis. The magnetic ﬁeld is chosen parallel to the z axis of our coordinate system
and the symmetric gauge is adopted for the vector potential. The gyromagnetic factor of the electron is chosen to be
equal to two. The Hamiltonian, therefore, takes on the following appearance:

The symbols ri, pi and Li denote the position vectors, their canonical conjugated momenta and the angular momenta
of the two electrons, respectively. B and R are the vectors of the magnetic ﬁeld and internuclear distance, respectively
and R denotes the magnitude of R. With S we denote the vector of the total electronic spin. Throughout the paper
we will use atomic units.

The Hamiltonian (1) commutes with the following independent operators: the parity operator P , the projection
Lz of the electronic angular momentum on the internuclear axis, the square S2 of the total electronic spin and the
projection Sz of the total electronic spin on the internuclear axis.
In ﬁeld free space we encounter an additional
independent symmetry namely the reﬂections of the electronic coordinates at the xz (σv) plane. The eigenfunctions
possess the corresponding eigenvalues ±1. This symmetry does not hold in the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld! Therefore,
the resulting symmetry groups for the hydrogen molecule are D∞h in ﬁeld free space and C∞h in the presence of a
magnetic ﬁeld [31].

In order to solve the ﬁxed-nuclei electronic Schr¨odinger equation belonging to the Hamiltonian (1) we expand the
electronic eigenfunctions in terms of molecular conﬁgurations. In a ﬁrst step the total electronic eigenfunction Ψtot
of the Hamiltonian (1) is written as a product of its spatial part Ψ and its spin part χ, i.e. we have Ψtot = Ψχ. For
the spatial part Ψ of the wave function we use the LCAO-MO-ansatz, i.e. we decompose Ψ with respect to molecular
orbital conﬁgurations ψ of H2, which respect the corresponding symmetries (see above) and the Pauli principle:

Ψ = Xi,j
= Xi,j

cij [ψij (r1, r2) ± ψij (r2, r1)]

cij [Φi (r1) Φj (r2) ± Φi (r2) Φj (r1)]

The molecular orbital conﬁgurations ψij of H2 are products of the corresponding one-electron H +
2 molecular orbitals
Φi and Φj. The H +
2 molecular orbitals are built from atomic orbitals centered at each nucleus. A key ingredient
of this procedure is a basis set of nonorthogonal optimized nonspherical Gaussian atomic orbitals which has been
established previously [37,38]. For the case of a H2−molecule parallel to the magnetic ﬁeld these basis functions read
as follows:

φm

kl (ρ, z, α, β, ±R/2) = ρ|m|+2k (z ∓ R/2)l expn−αρ2 − β (z ∓ R/2)2o exp {imφ}

(2)

The symbols ρ = +px2 + y2 and z denote the electronic coordinates. m, k and l are parameters depending on the

subspace of the H-atom for which the basis functions have been optimized and α and β are variational parameters.
We remark that the nonlinear optimization of the variational parameters α and β has to be accomplished for typically
of the order of 100 atomic orbitals and is done by reproducing many excited states of the hydrogen atom for each ﬁeld
strength separately. It represents therefore a tedious and time consuming work which has, however, to be done with
great care in order to obtain precise results for the following molecular structure calculations. For a more detailed
description of the construction of the molecular electronic wave function we refer the reader to Ref. [27].

In order to determine the molecular electronic wave function of H2 we use the variational principle which means

that we minimize the variational integral R Ψ∗HΨ
R Ψ∗Ψ

problem reads as follows:

by varying the coeﬃcients ci. The resulting generalized eigenvalue

(H − ǫS) c = 0

(3)

where the Hamiltonian matrix H is real and symmetric and the overlap matrix is real, symmetric and positive
deﬁnite. The vector c contains the expansion coeﬃcients. The matrix elements of the Hamiltonian matrix and the
overlap matrix are certain combinations of matrix elements with respect to the optimized nonspherical Gaussian
atomic orbitals. A description of the techniques necessary for the evaluation of these matrix elements is given in
Ref. [27]. We mention here only that the electron-electron integrals needed a combination of numerical and analytical

3

techniques in order to make its rapid evaluation possible. The latter represents the CPU time dominating factor for
the construction of the Hamiltonian matrix.

For the numerical solution of the eigenvalue problem (3) we used the standard NAG library. The typical dimension
of the Hamiltonian matrix for each subspace varies between approximately 2000 and 5000 depending on the magnetic
ﬁeld strength. Depending on the dimension of the Hamiltonian matrix, it takes between 70 and 250 minutes for
simultaneously calculating one point of a PEC of each subspace on a IBM RS6000 computer. The overall accuracy
of our results with respect to the total energy is estimated to be typically of the order of magnitude of 10−4 and for
some cases of the order of magnitude of 10−3. It should be noted that this estimate is rather conservative; in some
ranges of the magnetic ﬁeld strength and internuclear distance, e.g., close to the separated atom limit, the accuracy
is 10−5 or even better. The positions, i.e. internuclear distances, of the maxima and the minima in the PECs were
determined with an accuracy of 10−2a.u. Herefore about 350 points were calculated on an average for each PEC. It
was not necessary to further improve this accuracy since a change in the internuclear distance about 1 × 10−2 a.u.
results in a change in the energy which is typically of the order of magnitude of 10−4 or smaller. The total CPU time
needed to complete the present work amounts to several years on the above powerful computer.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

To understand the inﬂuence of the external magnetic ﬁeld on the electronic structure of the hydrogen molecule we
ﬁrst have to remind ourselves of the properties in the absence of the ﬁeld. Accurate data for hydrogen are of great
importance both in astrophysics as well as laboratory physics. It is a paradigm for many molecular phenomena like
charge transfer, excitation, ionization or scattering processes. Indeed our CI calculations on the basis of an anisotropic
Gaussian basis set provided also signiﬁcant progress with respect to the knowledge of the ﬁeld-free excitations of the
molecule: several highly excited states have been calculated for the ﬁrst time and some of the PECs for the lower
lying states have been improved. The corresponding results have been presented to some detail in ref. [39] and contain
elaborate information on the ﬁrst eight excited singlet and triplet states for both gerade and ungerade parity. In the
following we will ﬁrst summarize the main properties of the excited singlet states in the absence of the ﬁeld and then
investigate the electronic structure in the presence of the magnetic ﬁeld with increasing ﬁeld strength. We hereby
ﬁrst deal with the gerade and subsequently with the ungerade states.

A. Excited gerade singlet states

1. Field-free states

The investigation of the electronic states and PECs has been done for all internuclear distances considered (0.8 ≤
R ≤ 1000a.u.) with the same atomic orbital basis set. The latter has been optimized to yield precise energies (accuracy
10−6 − 10−9) of the hydrogen atom for the six lowest states for both parities for vanishing atomic magnetic quantum
number. Additionally, in order to describe correlation eﬀects, we have included basis functions with atomic magnetic
quantum numbers 1 ≤ ma ≤ 5. The approximate number of two-particle conﬁgurations resulting from the above
basis set is 3800. The accuracy of the electronic energies for the higher excited states n1Σ+
g , n = 7 − 9 (n indicates
the degree of excitation) is, due to the above choice of the optimized basis set, lower than that for less excited states.
Figure 1 shows the PECs for the states n1Σ+
g , n = 2 − 9 where the dotted lines represent the curves for the higher
excited states n = 7 − 9. There is a large energetical gap (0.3 − 0.4a.u.) between the ground and the excited states
of 1Σ+
g symmetry. The ﬁrst ﬁve excited states are well-known from the literature [40]. Our calculations [39] show in
most cases an agreement within 10−6 − 5 · 10−5 compared to the literature and in several cases also a variationally
lower energy. As already mentioned the results on the higher excited states (n = 7 − 9) have for the ﬁrst time been
reported very recently in ref. [39].

As can be seen from ﬁgure 1 all the PECs of the states n1Σ+

g , n = 2 − 9 possess a deep potential well around
a minimum located approximately at R = 2a.u.. A particular feature occuring for most of the considered 1Σg(u)
states is the existence of a second outer minimum and therefore the corresponding PECs exhibit a double well.
Vibrational states in these outer wells [40] attracted recently signiﬁcant experimental interest [41] since they allow the
experimental observation of long-lived and highly excited valence states of the hydrogen molecule. The two minima
of the 31Σ+
g state arise due to the fact that two diﬀerent conﬁgurations of the same symmetry, namely the 1σg3dσg
and the 1σg2sσg conﬁgurations, are energetically minimized at two signiﬁcantly diﬀerent internuclear distances. The
deep outer wells of the n1Σ+
g , n = 2, 4, 7 states arise due to a series of avoided crossings between the Heitler-London
conﬁgurations H(1s)+H(nl) and the ionic conﬁgurations H + −H −(1s2). Particularly the 71Σ+
g state possesses a very

4

broad and deep (0.015473a.u.!) outer potential well which is separated by a broad barrier from the inner well located
at R ≈ 2a.u.. The outer minimum is located at R ≈ 33.7a.u.. A series of avoided crossings at very large internuclear
distances R ≈ 300a.u. leads to the energetically equal dissociation limits H(1s) + H(4l) of the n1Σ+
g , n = 7 − 9
states. The dissociation channel of the 101Σ+
g state is the ionic conﬁguration H + + H −(1s2). Tables 1 to 3 contain
(among the data in the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld) the total and dissociation energies at the equilibrium internuclear
distances, the equilibrium internuclear distances and the total energies in the dissociation limit for the ﬁrst to third
excited 1Σ+

g , n = 2 − 4 states in the absence of the magnetic ﬁeld.

2. Evolution in the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld

The subspace of 1Σg symmetry contains the electronic ground state of the hydrogen molecule in ﬁeld-free space and
in the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld in the regime 0 < B < 0.1a.u. For a detailed discussion of the appearance of this
state and the global ground state with increasing ﬁeld strength in general we refer the reader to refs. [24, 25, 27–30]
(see also introduction of the present work). In the following we investigate the evolution of the excited n1Σg, n = 2 − 8
states with increasing magnetic ﬁeld strength for the regime 0 < B < 100a.u.. We will ﬁrst study the changes of the
PECs of individual states with increasing ﬁeld strength and thereafter we present a global view of the evolution of the
spectrum. In order to compare the PECs for the same state for diﬀerent ﬁeld strengths we subtract from the total
energies the corresponding energies in the dissociation limit (which is diﬀerent for diﬀerent ﬁeld strengths), i.e. we
show the quantity E(R) = Et(R) − limR→∞Et(R). In general the dissociation limit of a certain state of Σ symmetry
changes with increasing ﬁeld strength which is due to the reordering of the energy levels of the atoms (hydrogen,
hydrogen negative ion) in the external ﬁeld. For the atomic states we will use in the following the notation nmπa
a
where n speciﬁes the degree of excitation and ma, πa the atomic magnetic quantum number and z-parity, respectively.
Let us begin our investigation of the evolution of individual states with increasing ﬁeld strength with the 21Σg state
whose PECs are shown in Figure 2a. The positions of the two minima and the corresponding maximum decrease
with increasing ﬁeld strength. The depth of the inner potential well decreases for B <
∼ 0.5a.u. and increases rapidly
for B >
∼ 1a.u.. The depth of the outer well is monotonically increasing for the complete regime 0 < B < 100a.u.. For
B <
∼ B <
∼
20.0a.u. (see ﬁgure 2a). The dissociative behaviour of the PECs changes signiﬁcantly with increasing ﬁeld strength.
The origin of these changes is the fact that for B <
∼ 10a.u. the dissociation channel is H2 → H(10+) + H(10−)
whereas for B >
s ) (the index s stands for spin singlet).
The appearance of the ionic conﬁguration as the dissociation channel for the low-lying electronic 21Σg state can be
explained as follows. It is well-known that the hydrogen negative ion possesses inﬁnitely many bound states in the
presence of a magnetic ﬁeld of arbitrary strength assuming an inﬁnite nuclear mass [44, 45]. Certain of these bound
states show a monotonically increasing binding energy with increasing ﬁeld strength. The latter surpass then more
and more of the energy levels belonging to two hydrogen atoms one being in the global ground state and the other
one in the corresponding excited state. For a suﬃciently strong magnetic ﬁeld we therefore expect the conﬁguration
s ) to become the dissociation channel particularly for the ﬁrst excited state of 1Σg symmetry. Due to the
H + + H −(10+
long range forces the onset of the asymptotic (R → ∞) behaviour of the corresponding PECs with the ionic channel
(H + + H −) is qualitatively diﬀerent from the PECs with a neutral dissociation limit (H + H). This explains the
diﬀerent asymptotic behaviour of the PECs shown in ﬁgure 2a with increasing ﬁeld strength. Finalizing the discussion
of the 21Σg state we remark that its PECs possesses a second maximum for 0.01 <
∼ 5.0a.u. which however occurs
at large internuclear distances (R ≈ 20a.u.) and is only of the order of 10−4a.u. above the dissociation limit. Table 1
contains relevant data of the PECs of the 21Σg state with increasing ﬁeld strength.

∼ 50a.u. the inner well is therefore deeper than the outer well and vice versa for 0.05 <

∼ 20a.u. we have the asymptotic behaviour H2 → H + + H −(10+

∼ 0.01a.u. and B >

∼ B <

Next we turn to the second excited i.e. the 31Σg state whose PECs are shown in ﬁgure 2b. The positions of the two
minima and the corresponding maximum already present in ﬁeld-free space decrease monotonically with increasing
ﬁeld strength. Starting from B = 0a.u. the depth of the inner well decreases with increasing ﬁeld strength whereas
it increases for B >
∼ 0.5a.u.. Besides a very small interval of ﬁeld strengths the depth of the outer well increases
with increasing ﬁeld strength. For B ≤ 5.0a.u. the outer well is deeper than the inner one whereas for B >
∼ 10a.u.
the deep inner well dominates the shape of the PEC. We remark that the curvature at the (ﬁrst) maximum and
the outer minimum increases signiﬁcantly with increasing ﬁeld strength. The evolution of these increasingly sharper
turns can only be fully understood if one looks at the complete spectrum (see ﬁgure 3 and in particular 3(e)) with
increasing ﬁeld strength: they develop due to a number of narrow avoided crossing of the ﬁrst to third excited states
in strong ﬁelds. An interesting property of the PEC of the 31Σg state is the existence of an additional outer (third)
minimum for the interval 0.01 <
∼ 10a.u. which is shown in ﬁgure 2c. This minimum arises due to the interaction
with the ionic conﬁguration H + + H −. In ﬁeld-free space the lowest and only bound ionic channel H + + H −(10+
s )
is the dissociation channel of the 101Σ+
g state. With increasing ﬁeld strength the hydrogen negative ion becomes

∼ B <

5

∼ 0.05a.u. and therefore almost invisible in ﬁgure 2c. For B >
∼ 0.5a.u. the dissociation channel is H(10+) + H(20+) and for 1.0 <

increasingly stronger bound (see discussion above) and therefore it occurs as the dissociation channel for the sequence
of excited states 91Σg, 81Σg, ... ﬁnally becoming the dissocation channel of the 21Σg state for B >
∼ 20a.u.. The
existence of the additional outer minimum becomes now understandable: due to the energetical lowering of the ionic
dissociation channel with increasing ﬁeld strength the higher excited states of 1Σg symmetry evolve outer minima and
corresponding wells for certain regimes of the ﬁeld strength. For the 31Σg state this outer well is extremely shallow
for B <
∼ 0.1a.u. it becomes however well-pronounced.
Between B = 0.5a.u. and B = 1.0a.u. there occurs a change with respect to the dissociation channel of the 31Σg. For
0 < B <
s ). The
similar asymptotic behaviour of the PECs belonging to diﬀerent ﬁeld strengths (see ﬁgure 2c for B = 1.0, 5.0 and
10.0) arises due to the fact that they possess all the ionic dissociation channel. In the latter regime the position of
the (third) outer minimum increases with increasing ﬁeld strength (for B = 10.0a.u. the outer minimum is located
at ≈ 85a.u.). Finally there is a second change of the dissociation channel of the 31Σg state to H(10+) + H(10−) and
therefore the outer minimum disappears for B >
∼ 20a.u.. Table 2 contains the total and dissociation energies at the
equilibrium internuclear distances, the equilibrium internuclear distances and the total energies in the dissociation
limit for the second excited 31Σ+

∼ 10a.u. it is H + + H −(0+

g state in the regime 0 < B < 100a.u.

∼ B <

Next we focus on the third excited 41Σg whose PECs with increasing ﬁeld strength are shown in ﬁgure 2d. In
ﬁeld-free space it possesses two minima and associated potential wells located at R = 1.97a.u. and R = 11.21a.u.,
respectively. The position of the inner minimum increases with increasing ﬁeld strength whereas the corresponding
dissociation energy decreases. Finally for B ≈ 0.2a.u. the associated well disappears but reappears for B >
∼ 0.5a.u..
With further increasing ﬁeld strength the position of this inner minimum decreases and the depth of the corresponding
well increases monotonically for B >
∼ 1a.u.. Independently of this ﬁrst inner minimum and the outer minimum there
appears for B >
∼ 0.2a.u. an additional third minimum and corresponding well (see table 3 and ﬁgure 2d) for small
internuclear distances 1 − 3a.u.. Although this new minimum and well are energetically well below the dissociation
limit for B >
∼ 20.0a.u. they are separated from the other inner minimum only by a tiny barrier. These facts will
become better understandable in the context of our discussion of the evolution of the whole spectrum with increasing
ﬁeld strength (see below). The properties of the PEC of the 41Σg state at large internuclear distances are somewhat
analogous to that of the 31Σg state. The outer minimum has its origin in the interaction of the neutral H + H and
ionic H + + H − conﬁgurations. Starting with B = 0 and increasing the ﬁeld strength the depth of the outer well
increases. The ﬁrst change of the dissociation channel from H2 → H(10+) + H(30+) to H2 → H + + H −(10+
s ) occurs
in the regime 0.1 < B < 0.2a.u..
∼ 1.0a.u. the position of the outer minimum increases
with increasing ﬁeld strength (for B = 0.5a.u. it is already R = 50a.u.) and the depth of the outer well decreases.
Due to the further increasing binding energy of the hydrogen negative ion 10+
s state with increasing ﬁeld strength we
encounter a second change of the dissociation channel at B ≈ 1.0a.u. to H2 → H(10+) + H(20+) which causes the
disappearance of the outer minimum and well. Table 3 provides the corresponding data for the 41Σg state.

In the regime 0.1 <

∼ B <

The PECs of the 51Σg and 61Σg states are shown in ﬁgures 2e and 2f, respectively. For both states the positions
of the maxima and minima as well as the corresponding total energies show an ’irregular’ behaviour as a function of
the ﬁeld strength for B <
∼ 2.0a.u.. We therefore focus on the main features of these states. For certain regimes of
the ﬁeld strength we observe double well structures for the PECs. Analogously to the n1Σg, n = 2 − 4 states there
exist additional outer minima and wells due to the interaction with the ionic conﬁguration for certain ﬁeld strength
regimes. For B > 2.0a.u. the position of the ﬁrst inner minimum decreases rapidly with increasing ﬁeld strength
whereas the corresponding dissociation energy increases. Also we observe the existence of minima whose energies lie
above the dissociation energy, i.e. the corresponding wells contain if at all metastable states. We remark that some
of the above-discussed features, in particular those associated with small energy scales, might not be visible in the
corresponding ﬁgures 2 but only in a zoom of the relevant regimes of internuclear distances of the considered PECs.
We again emphasize that due to the large amount of data we do not present full PECs or data on the higher excited
states n1Σg, n = 5 − 8 which can be obtained from the authors upon request.

3. Discussion of the evolution of the complete spectrum

In the present subsection we focus on the evolution of the complete spectrum of the excited n1Σg, n = 2 − 8 states
with increasing ﬁeld strength. This will give us the complementary information to the evolution of individual states
presented above. Figure 3a-f shows the corresponding PECs for the ﬁeld strengths B = 0.01, 0.1, 0.5, 5.0, 100.0a.u.,
respectively. The PECs of the ﬁve energetical lowest excited states n1Σg, n = 2 − 6 are hereby illustrated with full
lines indicating their higher accuracy whereas the PECs of the electronic states n1Σg, n = 7, 8 are less accurate and
illustrated with dotted lines. Before we discuss the evolution with increasing ﬁeld strength some general remarks are
in order. The energy gap between the ground state 11Σg and the ﬁrst excited state 21Σg is of the order of 0.4a.u. in

6

ﬁeld-free space and increases montonically with increasing ﬁeld strength. At the same time the total energies of all
states n1Σg are shifted in lowest order proportional to B with increasing ﬁeld strength which is due to the raise of
the kinetic energy in the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld.

In ﬁeld-free space many of the dissocation channels of the PECs of excited 1Σg states are degenerate due to the
degeneracies of the ﬁeld-free hydrogen atom (see ﬁgure 1 and 4). The major diﬀerence of the PECs in ﬁeld-free space
compared to those for weak ﬁelds is the removal of these degeneracies (see, for example, ﬁgure 3a for B = 0.01a.u.).
With increasing ﬁeld strength ﬁgures 3a-d (B = 0.01, 0.1, 0.5 and 5.0a.u.) demonstrate the systematic lowering of the
diabatic energy curve belonging to the ionic conﬁguration H + + H −(1s2). This diabatic curve passes through the
spectrum with increasing ﬁeld strength thereby causing an intriguing evolution of avoided crossings and corresponding
potential wells for the individual states. At B ≈ 0.1a.u. the fourth excited 51Σg state acquires the ionic dissociation
channel. The 71Σg state thereby looses its outer potential well which was very well-pronounced in the absence of
the external ﬁeld. In the same course the 31Σg state shows a number of avoided crossings with the 21Σg state:
it
develops an additional outer minimum and well which is rather deep at B ≈ 0.5a.u. accompanied by the ﬂattening
of the ﬁrst inner well and the deepening of the second inner well. Furthermore we observe for B ≈ 0.5a.u. the
appearance of a large number of avoided crossing among the higher excited states n1Σg, n = 5 − 8 at R ≈ 5a.u..
At B ≈ 0.2a.u. the third excited 41Σg state acquires the ionic dissociation channel. Subsequently, i.e. with further
increasing ﬁeld strength, the second excited 31Σg state (see ﬁgure 3d) and ﬁnally the ﬁrst excited 21Σg state acquire
ionic character for suﬃciently large internuclear distances. In the high ﬁeld situation (see ﬁgure 3e for B = 100a.u.)
only the energetically lowest excited state possess a well-pronounced double well structure and the overall picture
is dominated by the fact that the PECs of the considered states possess a very similar shape and are energetically
very close to each other in particular around the inner minimum at small internuclear distances. Figure 3f shows for
B = 100a.u. a zoom of the series of avoided crossings occuring for the higher excited states n1Σg, n = 5 − 10 in the
regime 2 < R < 12a.u..

B. Excited ungerade singlet states

accuracy in the literature [42]. Our results [39] show a relative accuracy of 10−4 for the energies of the 11Σ+
of 10−5 for the ﬁrst two excited states i.e. the n1Σ+
lower than the data presented in [42]. The PECs for the n1Σ+

Figure 4 shows the PECs of the ground as well as eight excited states of 1Σ+

The PEC of the ground state 11Σ+

u state is similar to that of the ground state 11Σ+

u of ungerade symmetry possesses a minimum at R = 2.43a.u. and a corresponding
deep well. A closer look at the wave function reveals its ionic character for 3 < R < 7a.u.. With further increasing
internuclear distance the ionic character of the wave function decreases and the corresponding dissociation channel
is H2 → H(1s) + H(2p). The PEC of the ﬁrst excited 21Σ+
u : its
equilibrium internuclear distance is Req = 2.09 the dissociation channel is identical to that of the 11Σ+
u state. The
depth of its single well is however only one third of the depth of the well of the 11Σ+
u state. For the higher excited
states we observe a similar behaviour as in the case of the excited electronic states of 1Σ+
g symmetry. The PECs of
the n1Σ+
u , n = 3 − 9 states possess a deep well around a minimum located approximately at R ≈ 2a.u.. Furthermore
the n1Σ+
u , n = 3, 6 states exhibit additional deep outer potential wells at large internuclear distances which arise
due to the avoided crossings of the Heitler-London conﬁgurations with the corresponding ionic conﬁguration. The
outer minimum of the 61Σ+
u state is located at 33.7a.u. and the corresponding well possesses a remarkable depth of
0.015134a.u.: it is expected to contain a large number of long-lived vibrational states. Tables 4 to 6 contain (among
the data in the presence of the magnetic ﬁeld) the total and dissociation energies at the equilibrium internuclear
distances, the equilibrium internuclear distances and the total energies in the dissociation limit for the ﬁrst to third
excited 1Σ+

u states in the absence of the magnetic ﬁeld.

2. Evolution in the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld

First of all we remark that the dissociation channels of the (n + 1)1Σg states coincide with those of the n1Σu states
for n = 1 − 7 in the complete regime 0 ≤ B ≤ 100a.u.. The qualitative behaviour of the PECs of the n1Σu states at

7

large internuclear distances is therefore similar to that of the (n + 1)1Σg states discussed in the previous section. In
particular many of the explanations and remarks provided there hold also for the present case of the n1Σu states.

Before discussing the behaviour of the PECs of the individual excited n1Σu states with increasing ﬁeld strength
some remarks concerning the lowest, i.e. ground state of 1Σu symmetry are in order (for its PEC with increasing
ﬁeld strength see ﬁgure 6). Its dissociation energy increases monotonically with increasing ﬁeld strength whereas its
equilibrium internuclear distance increases slightly for weak ﬁelds and decreases signiﬁcantly for increasingly stronger
ﬁelds. As indicated above the asymptotic R → ∞ behaviour of the PECs of the 11Σu and 21Σg states is very similar.
For B = 100a.u. the PEC of the 11Σu state possesses a peculiar shape which is largely determined by the ionic
dissociation channel H + + H −(10+
s ) (see ﬁgure 6f). For more details on this state we refer the reader to ref. [27, 28].
The ﬁrst excited 21Σu state possesses in ﬁeld-free space an equilibrium internuclear distance Req = 2.09a.u.. Figure
5a shows the corresponding PEC with increasing ﬁeld strength for 0 ≤ R ≤ 5a.u. whereas ﬁgure 5b illustrates
particularly the behaviour at large internuclear distances. In the regime 0 ≤ B <
∼ 0.2a.u. the dissociation energy
decreases slightly and the bond length increases. With further increasing ﬁeld strength the dissociation energy
increases drastically and the bond length decreases. For 0.1 <
∼ 50a.u. there exists a maximum and a corresponding
additional outer minimum at large internuclear distances (see ﬁgure 5b) whose origin is again the emergence of the ionic
conﬁguration for the wave function of the 21Σu state. Figure 5b also demonstrates the similarity of the asymptotic
R → ∞ behaviour of the PECs of the 21Σu state in the regime 1.0 ≤ B ≤ 10.0a.u.. The corresponding data for the
PECs of the ﬁrst excited 21Σu state are given in table 4.

∼ B <

Turning to the second excited 31Σu state we observe that the depth of the potential well located for B = 0a.u.
at Req = 2.03a.u. decreases for weak ﬁelds whereas it increases signiﬁcantly for strong ﬁelds B >
∼ 1.0a.u. (see ﬁgure
5c). The existence of an additional outer minimum for this state can be seen in ﬁgure 5d.
In many respects a
similar behaviour to that of the 21Σu state is observed although, of course, the regimes of ﬁeld strength for which
the individual phenomena take place are diﬀerent. Table 5 contains the corresponding data of the PECs of the 31Σu
state. Finally ﬁgures 5e and 5f show the PECs of the n1Σu, n = 4, 5 states with increasing ﬁeld strength, respectively.
They exhibit a number of maxima and minima most of which can however hardly be seen in ﬁgures 5e,f or occur
at large internuclear distances. The origin of their existence are again the diﬀerent (ionic and neutral) dissociation
channels. These maxima and minima are present only for certain individually diﬀerent regimes of the ﬁeld strength.
Some of them are located above and some of them below the dissociative threshold. As can be seen the bond length
(belonging to the inner minimum) decreases monotonically and the dissociation energy increases signiﬁcantly above
some critical value Bc. The inner minimum and associated well possesses a remarkably large dissociation energy for
strong ﬁelds. Table 6 provides data on the PECs of the 41Σu state.

To ﬁnalize our discussion on the 1Σu subspace we show in ﬁgure 6 the evolution of the spectrum with in-
creasing ﬁeld strength. Figures 6a-f show the PECs for the n1Σu, n = 1 − 8 states for the ﬁeld strengths
B = 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 10.0, 100.0a.u., respectively. Analogously to the case of the 1Σg subspace we observe for weak
ﬁelds the removal of the degeneracies due to the ﬁeld-free hydrogen atom in the dissociation limit. With increas-
ing ﬁeld strength we see the lowering of the diabatic energy line belonging to the ionic conﬁguration which causes
the appearance and disappearance of outer maxima, minima and corresponding outer potential wells until ﬁnally
(B = 100a.u.) the 11Σu state possess the ionic dissociation channel H2 → H + + H −(10+
s ) which is the origin of the
peculiar shape of its PEC. A number of further observations made for the manifold of the n1Σg, n = 1 − 8 states
above can also be seen for the n1Σu, n = 1 − 8 states in ﬁgure 6 like, for example, the similar shape of the potential
wells of the excited states in the high ﬁeld limit.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

The hydrogen molecule is the most fundamental molecular system and of immediate importance in a variety of
diﬀerent physical circumstances.
In spite of the fact that it has been investigated over the past decades in great
detail and that our knowledge on this system has grown enormously there are plenty of questions and problems to
be addressed even for the molecule in ﬁeld-free space. As an example we mention certain highly excited Rydberg
states (71Σ+
u ) which, due to the ionic character of the binding for certain regimes of the internuclear distance,
possesses a deep outer well at large distances which contains a considerable number of vibrational states. On the other
hand the detailed knowledge of hydrogen (even of highly excited states) is of utmost importance for our understanding
and interpretation of the astrophysically observed interstellar radiation.

g , 61Σ+

Much less is known about the behaviour of the hydrogen molecule in strong magnetic ﬁelds. With increasing
ﬁeld strength the ground state of the molecule undergoes two transitions which are due to a change of the spin
and orbital character, respectively. Very recently the global ground state conﬁgurations have been identiﬁed for the
parallel conﬁguration (there are good reasons which lead to the conjecture that the derived results hold for arbitrary

8

angle of the internuclear and magnetic ﬁeld axis) both on the Hartree-Fock level [29, 30] and via a fully correlated
approach [27, 28]. For low ﬁelds the ground state is of spin singlet 1Σg symmetry, for intermediate ﬁelds the spin
triplet 3Σu state represent the ground state whereas in the high ﬁeld regime the 3Πu state is the energetically lowest
state.

The present work goes for the ﬁrst time beyond the ground state properties and investigates excited states of the
hydrogen molecule in the broad regime 0 < B < 100a.u.. We hereby focus on singlet states of both gerade as well as
ungerade symmetry: up to seven excited states have been studied for the parallel conﬁguration with a high accuracy
of the obtained PECs. A variety of diﬀerent phenomena have been observed out of which we mention here only the
most important ones. Double well structures observed in particular for the ﬁeld-free n1Σ+
g states are severly modiﬁed
in the presence of the ﬁeld thereby showing a ’coming and going’ of new maxima and minima as well as corresponding
wells. The overall tendency in the strong ﬁeld limit is the development of deep inner wells containing a large number of
vibrational states. In the course of the increasing ﬁeld strength a fundamental phenomenon occurs which has a strong
impact on the overall shape of the PECs. Due to the fact that the hydrogen negative ion becomes increasingly bound
with increasing ﬁeld strength we encounter changes in the dissociation channels of individual states from neutral
H2 → H + H ∗ to ionic H2 → H + + H − character. For a certain regime of ﬁeld strength Bc1 < B < Bc2 a certain
excited state possesses therefore the ionic dissociation channel thereby modifying the asymptotic behaviour of its
PEC to an attractive Coulombic tail. For weaker ﬁelds B < Bc1 higher excited states possess this ionic dissociation
channel whereas for stronger ﬁelds B > Bc2 it belongs to increasingly lower excitations. These facts inﬂuence the
overall appearance of the spectrum thereby creating features like outer potential wells and/or largely changing avoided
crossings.

The data on the PECs of the excited singlet states obtained here should serve as part of the material to be
accumulated for the investigation of quasimolecular absorption features in magnetic white dwarfs. The investigation
of excited triplet states of Σ symmetry or of Π states, which are of equal importance, are left to future investigations.

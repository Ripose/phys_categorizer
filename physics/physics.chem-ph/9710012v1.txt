Abstract

An algebraic method especially suited to describe strongly anharmonic
vibrational spectra in molecules may be an appropriate framework to study
vibrational spectra of Na+
n clusters, where nearly ﬂat potential energy sur-
faces and the appearance of close lying isomers have been reported. As an
illustration we describe the model and apply it to the Be4, H+
3 , Be3 and Na+
clusters.

INTRODUCTION

The study of metallic clusters has been mainly concerned with the electronic
properties of these systems. It has been suggested, however, that in analogy to the
way crystalline structure determines the optical response and metallic properties in
solid-state physics, the geometric structure may play a signiﬁcant role in the case
of cluster physics [1, 2]. Small ﬁnite size systems present special problems which
cannot directly be dealt with by means of the methods applied to the bulk. Nu-
clear theorists, on the other hand, have much experience dealing with “the many
body problem” and the application of these methods to clusters is already lead-
ing to signiﬁcant contributions to their understanding. These techniques, however,
usually ignore the position of atomic nuclei [3]. In [1, 2] ab initio calculations for

−

≥

n (n = 2

Na+
9, 11, 21) clusters at low temperature are reported, which allow the
assignment of speciﬁc cluster geometries by comparing the theoretical results with
experimental optical depletion spectra for these systems. While for dimers and
trimers the rovibrational spectra lead to a precise determination of internuclear
distances and ground-state potential energy surfaces (P.E.S.), up to now the reso-
lution of the vibronic structure for n
4 is not enough to carry out a theoretical
analysis that would conﬁrm the results of ref. [2] and give information on the P.E.S.
for the heavier clusters [4]. Even if the rovibrational data become available in the
near future, the calculations of [2] imply that the corresponding potential surfaces
are in general quite ﬂat and thus one expects anharmonic eﬀects to be signiﬁcant.
Also, in a number of cases close lying isomeric structures are found [2]. Since the
usual molecular physics calculations are well suited for deep minima and not for
“soft” molecules, it is important to consider alternative models in order to analyse
the experimental results. In this paper we describe a new model which was designed
to incorporate anharmonic behavior from the outset and which has been applied to
a number of molecules, including the Na+
3 cluster [5]-[8]. We illustrate the method
with applications to some D3h molecules and clusters and to the Be4 cluster.

THE U(2) VIBRON MODEL

The model is based on the isomorphism of the U (2) Lie algebra and the one

dimensional Morse oscillator, whose eigenstates can be associated with U (2)
⊃
SO(2) states [9]. In the framework of the model the total number of bosons N
is ﬁxed by the potential shape and the eigenvalue m of the SO(2) generator Jz,
takes the values m =
2)/2, . . .. The Morse spectrum is reproduced
twice and consequently for these applications the m-values must be restricted to
be positive. In terms of the U (2) algebra, the Morse Hamiltonian has the algebraic
realization

has a tetrahedral shape.
3h molecules can be similarly treated. In the Be4 case
there are six Ui(2) algebras involved (i = 1, . . . , 6). The operators in the model
are expressed in terms of the generators of these algebras, and the symmetry re-
quirements of the tetrahedral group
d can be readily imposed [6, 11]. The local
operators
acting on bond i can be projected to any of the fundamental irreps
Γ = A1, E and F2. Using the ˆJµ,i generators (3) we obtain the

metry A1, since it must commute with all operations in
by means of the

The ﬁve interaction terms in Eq. (10) correspond to linear combinations of the ones
obtained in lowest order in [6, 13]. However, it is necessary to include interactions
which are related to the vibrational angular momenta associated with the degen-
erate modes E and F2. These kind of terms is absent in the former versions of the
model [6, 13]. We now proceed to show how they can be obtained in the present
model. In conﬁguration space the vibrational angular momentum operator for the

[¯bi, ¯b†

and can be used to obtain a geometric interpretation of the algebraic operators in
terms of those in conﬁguration space. In the opposite sense, Eq. (5) provides a pro-
cedure to construct the anharmonic representation of harmonic operators through

We can now use our model to ﬁt the spectroscopic data of several polyatomic

We have generated the ab initio spectrum up to three phonons using the analysis

Note that the Be4 Hamiltonian (15) preserves the total number of quanta V .
This is a good approximation for this case according to the analysis of [14, 15],
but it is known that Fermi resonances can occur for certain molecules when the
fundamental mode frequencies are such that (V, V ′) states with V
= V ′ are close
in energy. These interactions can be introduced in the Hamiltonian by means of
3h molecules we can follow an analogous procedure,
a polyad analysis [16]. For
D
3h symmetry-adapted operators and states corre-
namely, we can construct the
sponding to (4) and [7] and carry out the building up procedure to construct the
Hamiltonian and higher phonon states, using in this case the appropriate projection
operators and Clebsch-Gordan coeﬃcients [6, 11].

the results for the levels with V
3. We point out that in [14, 15] several higher
order interactions are present which we have neglected. Since our model can be
put into a one to one correspondence with the conﬁguration space calculations, it
is in fact possible to improve the accuracy of the ﬁt considerably, but we have used
a simpler Hamiltonian than the one of [14, 15]. When no ab initio calculations
are available (or feasible) the present approach can be used empirically, achieving
increasingly good ﬁts by the inclusion of higher order interactions [7]. In Table 2
we present ﬁts to the spectra of Be3, Na+
3 up to three phonons. While
remarkably accurate descriptions of the ﬁrst two molecules can be achieved using
a four-parameter Hamiltonian, we were forced to include four additional higher
order terms in the H+
3 Hamiltonian in order to properly describe this molecule.
This is in accordance with the work of Carter and Meyer [17], who were forced to
include twice as many terms in the potential energy surface for H+
3 than for the

SUMMARY

In this paper we have studied the vibrational excitations of several molecules
and clusters in a symmetry-adapted algebraic model. These studies suggest that the
symmetry-adapted algebraic model provides a numerically eﬃcient tool to study
molecular vibrations with high precision. The main diﬀerence with other methods is
the use of symmetry-adapted tensors in the construction of the Hamiltonian. In this
approach, the anharmonicity can be introduced from the outset, interactions can be
constructed in a systematic way, each term has a direct physical interpretation, and
spurious modes can be eliminated exactly [16]. It is important to further explore
the scope and applicability of the present approach, and in particular study the
vibrational spectra in metallic clusters, including the appearance of isomeric shapes
with diﬀerent point symmetries.

We have carried out molecular dynamics simulations to understand the dynamics of a tagged pair
of atoms in a strongly non-ideal glass-forming binary Lennard-Jones mixture. Here atom B is smaller
than atom A (σBB = 0.88σAA, where σAA is the molecular diameter of the A particles) and the
AB interaction is stronger than that given by Lorentz-Berthelot mixing rule (ǫAB = 1.5ǫAA, where
ǫAA is the interaction energy strength between the A particles). The generalized time-dependent
pair distribution function is calculated separately for the three pairs (AA, BB and AB). The three
pairs are found to behave diﬀerently. The relative diﬀusion constants are found to vary in the order

R , showing the importance of the hopping process (B
hops much more than A). We introduce a non-Gaussian parameter (αP
2 (t)) to monitor the relative
motion of a pair of atoms, and evaluate it for all the three pairs, with initial separations chosen to be
at the ﬁrst peak of the corresponding partial radial distribution functions. At intermediate times,
signiﬁcant deviation from the Gaussian behavior of the pair distribution functions is observed, with
diﬀerent degree for the three pairs. A simple mean-ﬁeld (MF) model, proposed originally by Haan
[Phys. Rev. A 20, 2516 (1979)] for one component liquid, is applied to the case of binary mixture,
and compared with the simulation results. While the MF model successfully describe the dynamics
of the AA and AB pair, the agreement for the BB pair is less satisfactory. This is attributed to the
large scale anharmonic motions of the B particles in a weak eﬀective potential. Dynamics of next
nearest neighbor pairs are also investigated.

INTRODUCTION

In dense ﬂuids, there are many interaction-induced
phenomena that can be interpreted in terms of the dy-
namics of the pairs of atoms[1, 2, 3]. For example, nu-
clear overheusser eﬀect studies the relative motion of the
atoms.
In addition, an understanding of pair dynam-
ics can be of great importance in the studies of rate of
various diﬀusion controlled chemical reactions in dense
ﬂuids[4, 5]. Both the theoretical analysis[1, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,
11] and computer simulation[6, 8, 9, 10, 12] studies have
been carried out extensively to study the dynamics of a
pair of atoms in an one component liquid. Surprisingly,
however, we are not aware of any explicit study of the
dynamics of atomic pairs in binary mixtures whose dy-
namics generally show strong nonmonotonic composition
dependence[13, 14].

The study of the electronic spectroscopy of dilute chro-
mophores (’solutes’) in ﬂuids (’solvents’) is a useful tool
for obtaining the information about the structure and
dynamics of the solvents in the vicinity of the solute. In
an attempt to provide a microscopic foundation of the
Kubo’s stochastic theory of the line shape, Skinner and
coworkers[15] have recently developed a molecular theory
for the absorption and emission line shapes and ultrafast
solvation dynamics of a dilute nonpolar solute in nonpo-
lar ﬂuids. Due to the motion of the solvent molecules rel-
ative to the chromophore, the chromophore’s transition
frequency generally ﬂuctuates in time. Thus the nature

∗For correspondence: bbagchi@sscu.iisc.ernet.in

of the spectral line shape provide a useful information
about the details of the dynamics of the solvent relative
to the solute. An approximate treatment of the solvent
dynamics allowed the theory to express the transition
frequency ﬂuctuation time correlation functions (related
to the expressions for the absorption and emission line
shapes) solely in terms of the two-body solute-solvent
time-dependent conditional pair distribution function.
Many other applications of pair dynamics have been dis-
cussed by a number of authors[6, 8, 10, 11, 16].

The dynamics of a liquid below its freezing temper-
ature, that is, in a supercooled state, is far more com-
plex than what one would expect from a naive extrap-
olation of their high-temperature behavior. One of the
most challenging problems in the dynamics of a super-
cooled liquid is to understand quantitatively the origin
of the non-exponential relaxation exhibited by various
dynamical response functions and the extraordinary vis-
cous slow-down within a narrow temperature range as
one approaches the glass transition temperature from
above[17, 18]. Many experimental studies[19, 20] as
well as computer simulations[21, 22, 23, 24] have been
performed to shade light on the underlying microscopic
mechanism involved in supercooled liquids. These stud-
ies have revealed the evidence of the presence of dis-
tinct relaxing domains (spatial heterogeneity) which is
thought to be responsible for the non-exponential relax-
ations in deeply supercooled liquids. Molecular motions
in strongly supercooled liquid involves highly collective
movement of several molecules[22, 25, 26, 27, 28]. Fur-
thermore, the correlated jump motions become the dom-
inant diﬀusive mode[28, 29]. The observed heterogeneity
of the relaxations in a deeply supercooled liquid is found

to be connected to the collective hopping of groups of
particles[30].

The occurrence of increasingly heterogeneous dynam-
ics in supercooled liquids, however, has been investigated
solely in terms of single particle dynamics. The study of
the dynamics of pair of atoms which involve higher order
(two-body) correlations thus can provide much broader
insight into the anomalous dynamics of supercooled liq-
uids.
In this work, we have carried out molecular dy-
namics simulations in a strongly non-ideal glass form-
ing binary mixture (commonly known as Kob-Andersen
model[21]) to study the relaxation mechanism in terms
of the pair dynamics. The main purpose of the present
study is to explore the dynamics in a more collective
sense by following the relative motion of three diﬀerent
type (AA, BB, and AB) of nearest neighbor and next
nearest neighbor pair of atoms. These three pairs are
found to behave diﬀerently. The simulation results show
a clear signature of hooping motion in all the three pairs.
We have also performed simple mean-ﬁeld (MF) model
(as introduced by Haan[6] for one component liquid) cal-
culations to obtain the time dependent conditional pair
distribution functions.

The organization of the rest of the paper is as follows.
In Sec. II, we describe the details of the simulation and
the model system used in this study. The simulation
results are presented and discussed in Sec. III. In Sec.
IV, we have presented a mean-ﬁeld model calculations
for pair dynamics in binary mixture and the comparison
is made with the simulation results. Finally, we end with
a few concluding remarks in Sec. V.

II. SYSTEM AND SIMULATION DETAILS

We performed a series of equilibrium isothermal-
isobaric ensemble (N P T) molecular dynamics (MD) sim-
ulation of a strongly non-ideal well-known glass forming
binary mixture in three dimensions. The binary system
studied here contains a total of N = 1000 particles con-
sisting of two species of particles, A and B with NA = 800
and NB = 200 number of A and B particles, respectively.
Thus, the mixture consists of 80% of A particles and 20%
of B particles. The interaction between any two particles
is modeled by means of shifted force Lennard-Jones (LJ)
pair potential[31], where the standard LJ is given by

where i and j denote two diﬀerent particles (A and B).
The potential parameters are as follows:
ǫAA = 1.0,
σAA = 1.0, ǫBB = 0.5, σBB = 0.88, ǫAB = 1.5,
and σ12 = 0.8. The mass of the two species are same
(mA = mB = m). Note that in this model system the AB
interaction (ǫAB) is much stronger than both of their re-
spective pure counterparts and σAB is smaller than what
is expected from the Lorentz-Berthelot mixing rules. In

2

order to lower the computational burden the potential
has been truncated with a cutoﬀ radius of 2.5σAA. All
the quantities in this study are given in reduced units,
that is, length in units of σAA, temperature T in units
of ǫAA/kB, pressure P in units of ǫAA/σ3
AA. The corre-
mσ2
sponding microscopic time scale is τ =
AA/ǫAA.

p

All simulations in the NPT ensemble were performed
using the Nose-Hoover-Andersen method[32] where the
external reduced temperature is held ﬁxed at T ∗ = 1.0.
The external reduced pressure has been kept ﬁxed at
P ∗ = 20.0. The reduced average density ¯ρ∗(= ¯ρσ3
AA) of
the system corresponding to this thermodynamic state
point is 1.32. Throughout the course of the simulations,
the barostat and the system’s degrees of freedom are
coupled to an independent Nose-Hoover chain[33] (NHC)
of thermostats, each of length 5. The extended system
equations of motion are integrated using the reversible
integrator method[34] with a time step of 0.002. The
higher order multiple time step method has been em-
ployed in the NHC evolution operator which lead to sta-
ble energy conservation for non-Hamiltonian dynamical
systems[35]. The extended system time scale parameter
used in the calculations was taken to be 1.15 for both the
barostat and thermostats.

The systems were equilibrated for 2 × 106 time steps
and simulations were carried out for another 107 pro-
duction steps following equilibration, during which the
quantities of interest are calculated.

III. SIMULATION RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The three partial radial distribution functions, gAA(r),
gAB(r) and gBB(r) obtained from simulations are plot-
ted in ﬁgure 1. Due to the strong mutual interaction,
the AB correlation is obviously the strongest among the
three pairs. The splitting of the second peak of both
gAA(r) and gAB(r) is a characteristic signature of dense
random packing. The structure of gBB(r) is interest-
ingly diﬀerent.
It has an insigniﬁcant ﬁrst peak which
originates from the weak interaction between the B type
particles. The second peak of gBB(r) is higher than that
of the ﬁrst peak signifying that the predominant BB cor-
relation takes place at the second coordination shell. The
occurrence of the splitted second peak is clearly observed
here also.

In the present study, the central quantity of interest is
the time-dependent pair distribution function (TDPDF)
(ﬁrst introduced by Oppenheim and Bloom[1] in the the-
ory of nuclear spin relaxation in ﬂuids), g2(ro, r; t) which
is the conditional probability that two particles are sep-
arated by r at time t if that pair were separated by ro
at time t = 0. Thus, the TDPDF measures the relative
motion of a pair of atoms. For an isotropic ﬂuid, the
TDPDF depends only on the magnitudes of r, ro and
θ, where θ is the angle between r and ro. In computer
simulation, one can readily evaluate separately the radial
and orientational features of the relative motion. In the

following two subsections, we present, respectively, the
results obtained for the time evolution of the radial part
g2,rad(ro, r; t) and the angular part g2,ang(ro, θ; t) of the
TDPDF for the three diﬀerent pairs (AA, BB and AB).

A. Radial part of the TDPDF, g2,rad(ro, r; t)

In ﬁgure 2 we plot the g2,rad(ro, r; t) for the AA
pair with the initial separation ro corresponds to the
ﬁrst maximum of the partial radial distribution func-
tion gAA(r) (that is, pairs which are nearest neighbor)
at four diﬀerent times. While at short time (ﬁgure
2(a)) the distribution function has a single peak struc-
ture as expected, with increase in time it reaches slowly
to its asymptotic limit where additional peaks develop
at larger relative separations (see ﬁgures 2(b)-2(d)). The
microscopic details of the underlying diﬀusive process (by
which it approach to the asymptotic structure) can be ob-
tained by following the trajectory of the relative motions.
Figure 3 displays the projections onto an x-y plane of the
trajectory of a typical AA pair for the nearest neighbor
A atoms over a time interval ∆t = 500τ . The motion of
the AA pair is shown to be relatively localized for many
time steps and then move signiﬁcant distances only dur-
ing quick, rare cage rearrangements. This is a clear evi-
dence that the jump motions are the dominant diﬀusive
mode by which the separation between pairs of atoms
evolve in time.

The behavior of the distribution function g2,rad(ro, r; t)
for the AB pairs (where the interaction being the
strongest) is plotted in ﬁgure 4 at four diﬀerent times.
The distribution function shows the same qualitative be-
havior as we observed in the case of AA correlation (ﬁg-
ure 2). When compared to the AA correlation function
within the same time scale, the decay of the correlation
function is found to be faster despite the much strong AB
interaction. This must be attributed to the diﬀerence in
size of the two types of particles. As the B particles are
smaller in size than the A particles, they are more mo-
bile.
In addition, the AB interaction is such that AB
repulsion is felt at relatively small distances (σAB = 0.8
instead of 0.94 according to the Lorentz-Berthelot rules).
Consequently, the B particles are more prone to make
jumps than the A particles (as observed earlier by Kob
and Andersen[21]).

The nature of the relative motion of a typical AB pair
is illustrated in ﬁgure 5(a), which display the trajectory
of a typical AB pair (in the x-y plane) that were ini-
tially at the nearest neighbor (ﬁrst peak of gAB(r)). The
elapsed time is ∆t = 500τ . The dynamics of the rela-
tive motion is again dominated by hooping, the AB pair
remain trapped at their initial separation over hundreds
of time steps, before jumping to neighboring sites where
they again become localized. Further, the jump motion
is more frequent for the AB pair than that for the AA
pair. The individual trajectory of the A and B parti-
cles of the same AB pair within the same time window is

3

shown in ﬁgures 5(b) and 5(c), respectively. While both
the A and B particles hop, B particles move faster and
the eﬀect of caging is weaker (than the A particles) due
to its smaller size. In this time window, the net displace-
ment of the AB pair in the x-y plane is found to be quite
large as shown in ﬁgure 6 and mainly determined by the
displacement of the B particle.

In ﬁgure 7 we show g2,rad(ro, r; t) for the BB pair ini-
tially separated at the ﬁrst peak of gBB(r) at four diﬀer-
ent times. Due to weak interaction among B particles,
one expects that the B atoms in the BB pair will fast
lose the memory of their initial separation. This is in-
deed the case for the BB pair shown in ﬁgure 7. Once
again the jump dynamics is clearly seen in the trajectory
of a typical BB pair projected in the x-y plane (ﬁgure 8).
We now consider the case where the separation of the
initial pairs corresponds to the second peak of their re-
spective partial radial distribution functions of ﬁgure 1
(that is, pairs which are next nearest neighbor). The
distribution function for the AA pair is plotted in ﬁg-
ure 9. It shows a qualitative diﬀerent behavior because
the peak at the nearest neighbor separation develops in
a relatively short time. Here also the motion of the pairs
are found to be mostly discontinuous in nature, thus mo-
tion from second to ﬁrst nearest neighbor occurs mostly
by hopping. In ﬁgure 10 we plot the similar distribution
function of the AB pair. Since the AB interaction is the
strongest, the height of the ﬁrst peak grows faster than
that for the AA pair (compare ﬁgures 9(b) and 10(b)).
Next, in ﬁgure 11 we plot the distribution function for the
BB pair. Contrary to the AA and AB pairs, BB pairs
tend to retain their initial separation for a relatively long
time compared to the nearest neighbor pair. This can be
understood from the predominant BB correlations at the
second coordination shell.

B. Angular part of the TDPDF, g2,ang(ro, θ; t)

In this subsection we present the angular distribution
function g2,ang(ro, θ; t) for the three diﬀerent pairs (AA,
BB and AB). The initial separation ro for the three pairs
corresponds to the ﬁrst peak of the respective partial
radial distribution functions (ﬁgure 1).

In ﬁgure 12(a) we show the angular distribution
g2,ang(ro, θ; t) for the AA pair. We calculate the angular
distribution with respect to the initial separation vector
ro and irrespective of the value of the separation at time
t. The distribution which is a δ-function at t = 0, spreads
more and more with time and eventually it reaches to
a uniform distribution with zero slope. When we com-
pare to the distribution corresponding to the AB pair
as shown in ﬁgure 12(b), we ﬁnd that the approach to
the uniform value is faster in the case of AB pair. This
can be understood again in terms of the mobility of the
B particles which is more compared to the A particles.
In ﬁgure 12(c) we show how the distribution for the BB
pair changes with time. The relaxation is seen to be rel-

atively slower at short times compared to the AB pair.
This can be understood in terms of the eﬀective poten-
tial, discussed later.

motion

C. Relative diﬀusion: Mean square relative
displacement (MSRD)

In this subsection, we investigate the time dependence
of the mean square relative displacement h| rij (t) −
rij (0) |2iro, the simplest physical quantity associated
with the pair motion, where the index i and j denote
A and/or B particles and the subscript ro indicate the
ensemble averaging is restricted to the pairs whose ini-
tial separation corresponds to ro[9]. First, we consider
the case where the initial separations for the three pairs
corresponds to the ﬁrst peak of the respective partial ra-
dial distribution functions (see ﬁgure 1). In other words,
we consider ﬁrst those pairs that were initially nearest
neighbor pairs.

Figure 13 shows the result for the time dependence of
the relative mean square displacement (MSRD) of the
three pairs. At long times the MSRD varies linearly with
time. However, the evolution of MSRD with time diﬀers
for diﬀerent pairs. As expected, the smaller size of the B
particles and the weak BB interaction leads to a faster
approach of the diﬀusive limit of BB pair separation. The
time scale needed to reach the diﬀusive limit is shorter
for the AB pair than that for the AA pair.

R ≃ 0.0032, DAB

From the slope of the curves in the linear region one
can obtain the values of the relative diﬀusion constants
DR of the diﬀerent pairs. The values thus obtained
are the following: DAA
R ≃ 0.0048 and
DBB
R ≃ 0.0064. One should note that even though the
diﬀerence in size of the A and B particles is small, DBB
is almost twice of DAA
R . At suﬃciently long time, one
would certainly expect the diﬀusion constant for the rel-
ative motion of a pair should be the sum of the individual
diﬀusion constants of the two atoms obtained from the
slope of the corresponding mean square displacements at
long time. Indeed, we ﬁnd there is a good agreement.

R

An investigation of the behavior of MSRD is also per-
formed for atomic pairs which were initially next nearest
neighbor. When compared to the nearest neighbor pairs
(ﬁgure 13) we ﬁnd that the slope of the corresponding
straight lines are almost identical, although in the case
of AA and AB pairs the diﬀusive limits are reached at
shorter times. This has been shown in ﬁgure 14. One
should remember that the AA and AB correlations are
highest at the ﬁrst coordination shell whereas the high-
est BB correlations occur at the second coordination shell
(see ﬁgure 1). Thus, at short time the increase in slope
for the AA and AB pairs can be explained in terms of the
decrease in correlations at the second coordination shell.

In a highly supercooled liquid, the single particle dis-
placement distribution function Gs(r, t) (known as the
self-part of the van Hove correlation function) has an
in general, non-Gaussian. The
extended tail and is,
deviation from the Gaussian behavior is often thought
to reﬂect the presence of the transient inhomogeneities
and can be characterized by the non-Gaussian parame-
ter α2(t)[22]

α2(t) =

3h∆r4(t)i
5h∆r2(t)i2 − 1,

(2)

where h∆r2(t)i and h∆r4(t)i are the second and fourth
moments of Gs(r, t), respectively. At intermediate time
scale, α2(t) increases with time and the maximum of
α2(t) occurs around the end of the β relaxation region.
Only on the time scale of diﬀusion or the α relaxation,
α2(t) starts to decrease and ﬁnally at very long time limit,
it reaches to zero. α2(t) calculated for the A and B par-
ticles are shown in ﬁgure 15. The maximum in α2(t) is
seen to shift slightly towards left and also the height of
the maximum is higher for the B particles. This is a
clear evidence that the B particles probe much more het-
erogeneous environment than does the A particles. This
diﬀerence can be explained in terms of the smaller con-
centration of B particles, diﬀerent sizes of the A and B
particles and also from the fact that the interaction be-
tween the B particles is much weaker than that between
the A particles[21, 22].

Motivated by these ﬁndings for the single particle dis-
placement distribution function, we introduce a new non-
Gaussianity parameter for the pair dynamics, denoted by
αP
2 (t) can be a measure of the deviation from
the Gaussian behavior of the pair distribution function
g2(ro, r; t). It can be deﬁned as,

2 (t). αP

(3)
where h| rij (t) − rij (0) |2iro and h| rij (t) − rij(0) |4iro are
the mean square relative displacement and mean quartic
relative displacement of the ij pair. One should note that
αP
2 (t) is identical to zero for a Gaussian pair distribution
function.

In ﬁgure 16 we show the behavior of the αPij
2

as a func-
tion of time for the three diﬀerent pairs. We again con-
sider only those pairs that were initially nearest neighbor.
The behavior observed for the three pairs is markedly dif-
ferent. The dynamics explored by the BB pair is seen to
be less heterogeneous than the AA and AB pairs. Be-
cause of the smaller size of the B particles, the B par-
ticles reach the average distribution faster, although it
explores larger heterogeneity. The AA pair reaches the
diﬀusive limit at longer time scale than that for the AB
pair, the AB pair explore more heterogeneous dynamics

as is clearly evident from the diﬀerence in the maximum
value of αP

2 (t).

IV. THEORETICAL ANALYSIS

For the motion of an atomic pair in a pure ﬂuid,
Haan[6] introduced a simple mean-ﬁeld level equation of
motion for the time-dependent pair distribution function
g2. This equation was shown to give a quantitatively cor-
rect description both at short and long times[15]. This
treatment is mean-ﬁeld in the sense that the two atoms
were assumed to diﬀuse in an eﬀective-force ﬁeld of the
surrounding particles given by the gradient of the poten-
tial of mean force. The equation for g2 was represented
by a Smoluchowski equation and the correct short time
description of g2 was obtained only by introducing a non-
linear time that is related to the mean-squared distance
(MSD) moved by a single atom. In other words, an ad
hoc introduction of a time-dependent diﬀusion constant
D(t) in the equation of motion gives the correct descrip-
tion at short times.

2 (ro, r; t)

In the view of its success for one-component liquid, we
have performed a similar mean-ﬁeld model calculations
for the binary mixture considered here. The generaliza-
tion to binary mixture gives the following Smoluchowski
equation for the diﬀerent pairs
∂gij

where the index i and j denote A and/or B particles. β
is the inverse of the Boltzmann’s constant (kB) times the
absolute temperature (T). Wij (r) is the potential of mean

where h| rij (t) − rij (0) |2iro is the mean square relative
displacement (MSRD) of the ′ij′ pair. Note that an ap-
proximation is made in the above equation by neglecting
the cross-correlation between the two particles (’i’ and
’j’) and the MSRD is replaced by the sum of individual
particle’s mean square displacement (MSD).

Now the integration of the gij

2 (ro, r; t) over the solid
angles ˆΩo and ˆΩ corresponding to the initial and ﬁ-
nal positions, respectively, gives the radial part of the
full distribution function (the zeroth-angular moment of

The equation of motion for gij
2,rad(ro, r; t) (derived from
4) is solved numerically (by Crank-Nicholson
Eq.
method) for the diﬀerent pairs and the results obtained
from this model calculations are compared with the sim-
ulation results. The partial radial distribution functions
gij(r) and the mean-square displacements of the A and
B particles (required as input) are obtained from the
present simulation.

Figures 17 and 18 compare model calculations with
the simulated distribution functions for the AA and AB
nearest neighbor pairs. The time evolution of the dis-
tributions are described well by the simple mean-ﬁeld
model. The underlying eﬀective-potential energy sur-
faces are plotted in ﬁgure 19. Thus relative diﬀusion
in these cases can be considered as overdamped motion
in an eﬀective potential, which takes place mainly via
hopping (as shown in ﬁgures 3 and 5), which governs the
time evolution of the distributions for the AA and AB
pair.

Unfortunately, the good agreement observed above be-
tween simulation and theory for the AA and the AB
pairs, does not extend to the BB pair. This is shown
in ﬁgure 20. As the number of B particles present in
the system is much less (20 %) and the interparticle in-
teraction is weak, the eﬀective potential for a B atom
interacting with a nearest neighbor atom is unfavorable
(see the ﬁgure 19). Consequently, the nearest neighbor
BB pairs execute highly anharmonic motions. Thus, the
ﬂuctuations about the mean-force ﬁeld experienced by
the BB pair are large and important. These ﬂuctuations
are neglected here, as in other mean-ﬁeld level descrip-
tion.

The extension of the calculations to the case of next
nearest neighbor pairs also been carried out and com-
pared with the simulated distributions.
It should be
noted that compared to the nearest neighbor pairs, the
AA and AB pairs are now executes motions in a rela-
tively weak, shallow potential, whereas the motions of
the BB pairs takes place in a relatively strong, bound
potential well (see the ﬁgure 19). Thus, for the BB pairs,
one expects a better agreement with the simulated dis-
tributions compared to the earlier case (nearest neighbor
BB pairs). Indeed, the agreement is better for the BB
pairs, as shown in ﬁgure 21 (compare with ﬁgure 20). We
have found that the MF model provides a good descrip-
tion of the dynamics of the AA and AB pairs, although
the agreement is not as satisfactory as for the nearest
neighbor pairs.

Thus, it is evident that the MF description for the
time dependent pair distribution functions is reasonably
good for the AA and AB pairs. Simulation results have
shown that the relative diﬀusion of an AB pair is higher
than that for an AA pair. We noted that this due to

more frequent hopping of B particles than the A par-
ticles. Our main objective now is to see whether the
frequent jump motions of the B particles, as predicted
by the simulations, can be explained in terms of the MF
model described above.

We have performed an approximate calculation to get
an estimate of the transition rate between the ﬁrst two
adjacent minima in the eﬀective potential energy surface
of the AA and AB pairs (see the ﬁgure 21).
In other
words, the rate of crossing from the deep minima located
at the nearest neighbor pairs, to the adjacent minima
(corresponds to the next nearest neighbors). As the mo-
tion of a pair in the eﬀective potential was treated by
a Smoluchowski equation, we use the corresponding rate
expression in the overdamped limit to calculate the es-
cape rate. Thus, we have an expression for the escape
rate given by[36]

kS ∼=

ωminωmax
2πζ

exp

−

 

∆W
kBT !

(9)

where ∆W = W (rmax) − W (rmin) is the Arrhenius ac-
tivation energy and ωmin, ωmax are the frequency at the
minima (rmin) and maxima (rmax) in the eﬀective po-
tential W (r), respectively. The diﬀusion coeﬃcient D is
related to the friction ζ by D = kBT /ζ.

min ≃ 16.5, ω∗

Thus, to calculate the transition rate we need to know
the values of the frequencies ωmin, ωmax, and the bar-
rier height ∆W , which are diﬀerent for the AA and AB
pairs. For the AA pairs, these parameters are found to
be ω∗
max ≃ 6.5 and ∆WAA ≃ 2.25kBT ,
whereas for the AB pairs they are ω∗
max ≃
7.4 and ∆WAB ≃ 2.45kBT . The relative diﬀusion of the
two pairs are DAA
R ≃ 0.0032 and DAB
R ≃ 0.0048. Using
all these parameters, the escape rate calculated for the
S ≃ 5.9×10−3
AA and AB pairs are (in reduced units) kAA
S ≃ 8.8 × 10−3, respectively (in terms of time τ ,
and kAB
which is equal to 2.2 ps for argon units).

min ≃ 17.8, ω∗

Even though the barrier height ∆WAB > ∆WAA, the
transition rate for the AB pair is larger than that for
the AA pair. Thus, the jump motions are much more
frequent for the AB pair, due to the large diﬀusion of the
B particles in the potential energy surface (which mainly
occurs via hopping mode).

liquids in a more collective way, by following the relative
motion of the atoms rather than absolute motion of the
atoms. We ﬁnd that the three pairs (AA, BB and AB)
behave diﬀerently. The analysis of the trajectory shows a
clear evidence of the jump motions for all the three pairs.

The relative diﬀusion constant of the BB pair (DBB
R )
is almost twice the value for the AA pair (DAA
R ). This
clearly suggests the importance of the jump dynamics
for the B particles and indeed, we ﬁnd that the motion
of the B particles is mostly discontinuous in nature, while
the A particles show occasional hopping. The dynamic
inhomogeneity present in a supercooled liquid is generally
characterized by the well-known non-Gaussian parameter
α2(t), which describe the deviations from the Gaussian
behavior in the motion of a single atom. In this paper,
we have generalized this concept and introduce a non-
Gaussian parameter for the pair dynamics (αP
2 (t)), to
measure the deviations from the Gaussian behavior in
the relative motion of the atoms. At intermediate times,
all the three pair distribution functions for the three pairs
show signiﬁcant deviations from the Gaussian behavior,
with diﬀerent degree.

It is found that for the nearest neighbor AA and AB
pairs, which are conﬁned to a strong eﬀective potential
and merely makes anharmonic motions in it, the dynam-
ics can be treated at the mean-ﬁeld level. However, as
the motion of a nearest neighbor BB pair is highly an-
harmonic, one must include the eﬀects of the ﬂuctuations
about the mean-force ﬁeld, in order to get a correct de-
scription of the dynamics.

While the mean-ﬁeld treatment provides reasonably
accurate description of pair dynamics (at least for AA
and AB pairs), it must be supplemented with the time
dependent diﬀusion coeﬃcient (D(t)). This is a limita-
tion of the mean-ﬁeld approach because at present we do
not have any theoretical means to calculate D(t) from
ﬁrst principles. The mode coupling theory (MCT) does
not work because it neglects hopping which is the dom-
inant mode of mass transport in deeply supercooled liq-
uids, even when the system is quite far from the glass
transition. As we discussed recently, the hopping can be
coupled to anisotropy in the local stress tensor[26]. The
calculation of the latter is also non-trivial. Work in this
direction is under progress.

Let us ﬁrst summarize the main results of this study.
We have presented the molecular dynamics simulation re-
sults for the time dependent pair distribution functions in
a strongly non-ideal glass forming binary Lennard-Jones
mixture. In addition, a mean-ﬁeld description of the pair
dynamics is considered and the comparison is made with
the simulated distributions. The main goal of this inves-
tigation was to explore the dynamics of the supercooled

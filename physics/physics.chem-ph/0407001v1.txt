Size Information Obtained by Using Static Light
Scattering Technique

Yong Sun

June 26, 2011

Abstract

Detailed investigation of static light scattering (SLS) has been at-
tempted in this work based on dilute water dispersions of homogenous
spherical particles, poly(N -isopropylacrylamide) microgels and simulative
data. When Rayleigh-Gan-Debye approximation is valid, for the large par-
ticles, the simple size information, the static radius Rs and distribution
G (Rs), can be accurately obtained from SLS. Through the theoretical
analysis, for the small particles, the root mean-square radius of gyration
R2
and the molecular mass of particles measured by using the Zimm
g
plot are discussed. The results show that the molecular mass measured
(cid:10)
by using the Zimm plot over the average molecular mass of particles is a
function of the size distribution.

1 Introduction

The intensity of the scattered light is determined by the sizes, shapes and inter-
action among the particles in the scattering medium. Developed during the last
few decades, dynamic light scattering (DLS) is widely used to obtain the size
information of particles for colloidal dispersion systems. Although the static
light scattering (SLS) spectroscopy contains more sensitive size information, in
general, the measurements of SLS spectroscopy are simpliﬁed to the Zimm plot,
Berry plot or Guinier plot etc. to obtain the root mean-square radius of gyra-
tion
and the molecular mass of particles provided that the particle sizes
are small. Since it is hard to obtain the particle size distribution for small poly-
disperse systems by using DLS technique, for dilute poly-disperse homogeneous
spherical particles, Pusey and van Megen1 proposed a method to detect small
poly-dispersities when the Rayleigh-Gans-Debye (RGD) approximation is valid,
by measuring the dependence of the eﬀective diﬀusion coeﬃcient obtained from
the initial slope of the correlation function with respect to the scattering angle.
By deﬁnition, the eﬀective diﬀusion coeﬃcient is the intensity-weighted average
diﬀusion coeﬃcient. Both theoretical and experimental results show that the
angular dependence of the light scattering intensity is a sensitive function of the
particle’s size and distribution.

How to obtain the particle size distributions from the SLS data has been
researched by a few authors. Hallett and Strawbridge2 have studied the theo-
retical scattering intensity of a coated sphere with vertically polarized incident
light. Then the scattered intensity at the geometrical or linear trial radii between
rmin and rmax was used to ﬁt the SLS data. Schnablegger and Glatter3 assumed
that the size distribution can be described as a series of cubic B-splines, then
used the simulative data and measured data to demonstrate the computation
procedure.

In this article, we deal with the dilute poly-disperse homogeneous spherical
particles. We assume that the number distribution of particles is Gaussian and
we consider the eﬀects of the form factor and the scattering intensity-weighted
diﬀerences of diﬀerent size particles on the light scattering intensity. Then with
the assistance of a non-linear least squares ﬁtting program (N LLSQ), the mean
particle size Rs and the standard deviation σ are obtained. With this treat-
ment, we can avoid the constraints of the Zimm plot, Berry plot, Guinier plot
etc. on measurement, and their stringent dependence on sample quality and in-
strument at small angles. For large particles, size distributions can be measured
accurately. With the assistance of simulative data, the eﬀects of the reﬂective
light and noises have been investigated in detail. Through the theoretical and
and
simulative data analysis, the root mean-square radius of gyration
the molecular mass of particles measured by using the Zimm plot are also dis-
cussed. The results show that the molecular mass measured by using the Zimm
plot over the average molecular mass of particles is a function of the size distri-
bution. With theoretical and experimental data analysis, better understanding
of the size information contained in SLS spectroscopies is obtained.

3 Experiment

The SLS spectroscopies were measured by using the instrument built by ALV-
Laser Vertriebsgesellschaft m.b.H (Langen, Germany). It utilizes an ALV-5000
Multiple Tau Digital Correlator and a JDS Uniphase 1145P He-Ne laser to
provide a 23 mW vertically polarized laser at wavelength 632.8 nm.

In this experiment, N -isopropylacrylamide (NIPAM, monomer) from Acros
Organics was recrystallized from hexane/acetone solution. Potassium persul-
fate (KPS, initiator) and N, N ′-methylenebisacrylamide (BIS, cross-linker) from
Aldrich were used as received. Fresh de-ionized water from a Milli-Q Plus
water puriﬁcation system (Millipore, Bedford, with a 0.2 µm ﬁlter) was used
throughout the whole experiment. The synthesis of gel particles was described
elsewhere7,8 and the recipes of the batches used in this work are listed in Table
1.

4 Data Analysis

How to obtain the size information from SLS is shown in this section. The
experimental data of the P N IP AM microgel samples was used to show the
ﬁtting process and the simulative data was used to check the eﬀects of the
diﬀerent reﬂective light and the noises on the ﬁtted results and the eﬀects of
the distribution on the molecular mass of particles measured by using the Zimm
plot.

4.1 Experimental Data Analysis

vs q data of the sample P N IP AM

When Eq. 1 was used to ﬁt the Is
1
Iinc
measured at temperature 29oC, the ﬁtted mean radii Rs and the standard
deviations σ at diﬀerent scattering vector ranges are listed in Table 4.1. The
results show that the ﬁtted result’s errors decrease and the mean radius and
the standard deviation approximate constant values when the ﬁtting scattering
vector range is enlarged.
If the ﬁtting scattering vector range continues to
increase, the values of the radius and standard deviation begin to change and
χ2 changes to big. This is the results of the deviation between the real and the
theoretical light scattering intensity in the vicinity of the Is
s minimum. This
Iinc
minimum lies at about the scattering vector 0.0177 nm−1. In this range, most
of the scattering light is cancelled due to the light interference. So many other
characters of the particles can show the eﬀect on the light scattering intensity, for
example: the number distribution deviates from the Gaussian distribution, the
particle shape deviates from a perfect sphere, the density of particles deviates
from the homogenous density and the light scattering intensity from the solvent,
etc. In order to avoid the eﬀect of light interference, the ﬁtted results during the
scattering vector range 0.00345 nm−1 to 0.01517 nm−1 are chosen as the size
information obtained by using the SLS technique. In order to check the eﬀects
of the diﬀerent ﬁtting ranges of the scattering vector, the experimental data was
ﬁtted again by ﬁxing the larger value of q and decreasing the ﬁtting range. The
ﬁtted results also are shown in Table 4.1. The values show the ﬁtted results
approximate constant values when the ﬁtting range has enough large. Figure
4.1 shows the ﬁtted result and the residuals during the scattering vector range
0.00345 nm−1 to 0.01517 nm−1.

the ﬁtted results, the values of χ2 are too big, the value of mean static radius
Rs is equal to that obtained by using Eq. 1 in the ﬁtting range with the small

As discussing above, light interference aﬀects the ﬁtted results. In order to
eliminate the eﬀect of light interference, the measured data in the vicinity of the
Is
s minimum was neglected. Thus Eq. 4 was used to ﬁt the experimental data

in the whole scattering vector range again. The ﬁtted values are shown in Table
4.3. The values can be thought to be consistent with the ﬁtted results obtained
by using Eq. 1 in the ﬁtting range with the small values of the scattering vector

Because 0.45 µm ﬁlters were used to do dust free for our samples, we can
think that the very big particles do not exist. So the expected values calculated
by using Eq. 4 and the ﬁtted results obtained by using Eq. 1 in the ﬁtting range
with the small values of the scattering vector should be consistent with the
experimental data if the number distribution has been corrected. The expected
values calculated in three diﬀerent situations for the sample P N IP AM
1 are
shown in Figure 4.2. The expected results in third situation are consistent with
the experimental data.

4.2 Simulative Data Analysis

In order to conveniently discuss the eﬀects of the reﬂective light and the noises,
the simulative data has been produced with the Gaussian distribution.

4.2.1 Simulative data of large particles

For large particles, both the eﬀects of the reﬂective light and the noise must be
considered. First, the eﬀect of the reﬂective light is considered. The simulative
data of the incident light was produced by using Eq. 1 and the data of the
reﬂective light was obtained by using the following equation

The scattered intensity of the reﬂective light was added to the total scattered
intensities. When the ﬁnal data of Is
was obtained, the 3% random errors were

added. The simulative data 1 was produced when the mean radius was set 267
nm and the standard deviation was 23 nm. The ﬁtted results by using Eq. 1
at diﬀerent scattering vector ranges are listed in Table 4.5 for the value of b
was chosen to be 0.015. The results show that the ﬁtted result’s errors decrease
and the mean radius and the standard deviation approximate constant values
when the ﬁtting scattering vector range is enlarged. Figure 4.5 shows the ﬁtted
results and the residuals during the scattering vector range 0.00345 nm−1 to
0.01592 nm−1.

The ﬁtted results obtained by using Eq. 1 in the scattering vector range
0.00345 nm−1 to 0.01592 nm−1 were input Eq. 1 and Eq. 4 to calculate the
expected values at the whole scattering vector range with b: 0.015, respectively.
The results are shown in Figure 4.6. The expected results are consistent with
the simulative data.

In order to investigate the eﬀect of the reﬂective light on the ﬁtted results
obtained by using Eq. 1 in a ﬁtting range with the small values of the scattering
vector. The simulative data was produced for b=0.0, 0.005, 0.01 and 0.02 re-
spectively. The ﬁtted results at the same scattering vector range 0.00345 nm−1
to 0.01592 nm−1 are listed in Table 4.7. The ﬁtted values show that the size
information can be accurately obtained by using Eq. 1 in the ﬁtting range with
the small values of the scattering vector and the eﬀect of the reﬂective light do
not need to be considered.

4.2.2 Simulative data of small particles

For small particles, only the eﬀect of noises need to be considered. The simula-
tive data 2 was produced when the mean radius was set 90 nm and the standard
deviation was 7 nm. The ﬁnal simulative data was obtained in two diﬀerent
situations: one is that the noise was not added (f irst) and the other is that
the 1% statistical noise was added (second to ﬁfth). The ﬁtted results are listed
in Table 4.9. The values show that the ﬁtted results are aﬀected by the noise.
Figure 4.7 shows the ﬁtted results and residuals of the ﬁfth simulative data of
the simulative data 2.

If the simulative data 2 with the diﬀerent noises is put together, as shown
in Figure 4.8, the diﬀerence among the simulative data 2 with the diﬀerent
noises can not be distinguished. From the Zimm plot analysis, the root mean
and the Zimm’s molecular mass of particles
square radius of gyration
will be same. However, due to the size distribution, the average molecular
mass of particles
will have large diﬀerences for the particles with diﬀerent
distributions. Figure 4.9 shows the results by using the Zimm plot to ﬁt the
third simulative data of the simulative data 2. For the ﬁve simulative data, the

5 Results and Discussion

From the analysis of simulative data, for the large particles the reﬂective light
and the noises do not need to be considered when the size information is obtained
from the SLS data in the ﬁtting range with the small values of the scattering
vector. We ever produced the simulative data for the wide distribution and
much larger size. The conclusion is the same with that obtained from the
simulative data 1. For the wide distribution, the mean radius 267 nm and the
standard deviation 134 nm were used to produce the simulative data, the ﬁtted
results during the scattering vector range 0.00345 nm−1 to 0.01498 nm−1: the
0.5 nm and χ2
mean radius is 267.5
is 0.91. The expected values calculated by inputting the results in Eq. 1 and 4
respectively are shown in Figure 5.1.

For the much larger size, the mean radius 500 nm and the standard deviation
15 nm were used to produce the simulative data, the ﬁtted results during the

scattering vector range 0.00345 nm−1 to 0.00969 nm−1: the mean radius is
0.04 nm and χ2 is 0.37. The

For the experimental data measured from the real particles, the size infor-
mation can be obtained by ﬁtting the data in the range with the small values
of the scattering vector as the size information of the sample P N IP AM
1
at temperature 29oC was obtained. Due to the PNIPAM microgels possess
the temperature sensitivity during the temperature rang 15oC
50oC, in order
to show the phase transition of the diﬀerent samples together, the static radii
R40oC
of the four PNIPAM microgels at temperature 40oC are used as the stan-
s
dard values respectively, the ratios between the static radii RT
s at temperature
T and R40oC

are shown in Figure 5.3.

From the chemical knowledge, the materials of PNIPAM possess the temper-
ature sensitivity. If adding the N, N ′-methylenebisacrylamide, the temperature
sensitivity of PNIPAM microgels will be aﬀected by the content of the N, N ′-
methylenebisacrylamide which does not possess the temperature sensitivity. If
the content of the N, N ′-methylenebisacrylamide continues to increases, the
temperature sensitivity of PNIPAM microgels is becoming disappearance. Fig-
ure 5.3 clearly shows the feature. The phase transition of PNIPAM microgels,
indicated as the ratios RT
vs T , becomes less sharp and occurs in a
broader T range as the N, N ′-methylenebisacrylamide content increases.

Since the sizes of PNIPAM microgel particles at high temperature are small,
the ﬁtted values will be aﬀected by the noises as we have discussed for the

simulative data, but this method still can give the better values of
have discussed and let us avoid the stringent requirements for the sample quality
and the instrument at much smaller scattering angles. The ﬁtted values of the
four PNIPAM microgel samples at high temperatures are listed in Table 5.2. All

the experimental data of the sample P N IP AM
using the Zimm plot in a range with the small values of the scattering vector are

using the Zimm plot have a large uncertainty. The value is decided by the ﬁtted

6 Conclusion

The consistency between the theoretical results and static light scattering data
shows that the size information can be obtained by using the non-linear least
squares ﬁtting method and the SLS data in this form I(q) vs q contain sensitive
size information of particles. For the large particles, the reﬂective light and the
noises do not aﬀected the ﬁtted results in the range with the small values of the
scattering vector and the accurate size information can be obtained.

For small size particles, although the ﬁtted values are aﬀected by the noises,
this still is a good method to obtain the size information from the SLS data.
and avoid the stringent
It can give a better approximative value of
dependence on the sample quantity and the instrument. The molecular mass of
particles measured by using the Zimm plot is a better approximative value of
the average molecular mass of particles only for the particle systems with very
narrow distributions.

The simple number distribution G (Rs) obtained from the SLS data is the
distribution that people really want to obtain from the experimental data. The
simple number distribution G (Rs) can let us only consider the eﬀects of the
parameter size and avoid the eﬀects of other parameters when we analyze other
physical quantities.

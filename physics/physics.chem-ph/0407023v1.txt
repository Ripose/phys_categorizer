Abstract

Based on a quantum Langevin equation and its corresponding Hamiltonian within a c-number

formalism we calculate the vibrational dephasing rate of a cubic oscillator. It is shown that leading

order quantum correction due to anharmonicity of the potential makes a signiﬁcant contribution

to the rate and the frequency shift. We compare our theoretical estimates with those obtained

from experiments for small diatomics N2, O2 and CO.

INTRODUCTION

A molecule in a liquid undergoes random frequency ﬂuctuations due to the stochastic

forces imparted by the surrounding medium. The correlation between this frequency ﬂuc-

tuations results in vibrational dephasing. The problem has received wide attention both

from theoretical and experimental point of view over the last couple of decades. Several

approaches to understand the basic nature of vibrational dephasing have been made. These

include notably binary collision theory1 in which ﬂuctuations are taken into account in

terms of collisional events, hydrodynamic model2,3,4,5 relating random force and shear vis-

cosity of the liquid, Hamiltonian theory6 in terms of normal mode analysis and numerical

simulations7,8,9,10,11 using various molecular potentials. A key element of these formulations

is the realization that vibrational dephasing owes its origin to cubic anharmonicity of the

vibrational potential. In the present paper we attempt to explore further this issue within

a quantum mechanical content.

A good number of approaches to vibrational dephasing make use of generalized Langevin

equation that governs the dynamics of the system by an inﬁnite number of harmonic oscilla-

tors coupled linearly to the system. Very recently based on a coherent state representation

of noise operator and a positive deﬁnite Wigner canonical thermal distribution19 of bath os-

cillators a c-number quantum Langevin equation20,21,22,23,24,25,26 in the context of rate theory

and stochastic processes has been proposed. An important oﬀshoot of this formulation is

that it takes care of quantum correction due to nonlinearity of the system potential order

by order. It would thus seem that one should be able to analyze the vibrational dephasing

rate quantum mechanically for arbitrary noise correlation and temperature and explore the

role of this quantum correction to anharmonicity. This is the main purpose of this paper.

In what follows we construct a c-number Hamiltonian within a normal mode description

and estimate the dephasing rate by calculating the eﬀective correlation between the relevant

c-number co-ordinates of anharmonic origin. Since for a small diatomic molecule like N2,
the fundamental vibrational frequency ω0 is so high (2326 cm−1) that the ratio ~ω0/kT is
as large as 43.52 even at, say, 77 0K, it is imperative that quantum nature of the oscillator

molecule is signiﬁcant in estimating the dephasing rate in the harmonic as well as in the

anharmonic regime. With this end in view we examine the vibrational dephasing rate to

estimate the anharmonic quantum correction to this rate and its variation with temperature

2

away from critical or triple point for three widely studied diatomics N2, O2 and CO to allow

ourselves a fair comparison with experiments12,13,14,15,16,17,18.

The outlay of the paper is as follows: In Sec.II we introduce the quantum Langevin equa-

tion and its Hamiltonian counterpart within a c-number normal mode description. Since the

cubic nonlinearity gives rise to a leading order contribution to dephasing rate we estimate

the quantum vibrational dephasing rate for a cubic oscillator in Sec.III. The quantum cor-

rections due to nonlinearity of the system potential is calculated explicitly in Sec.IV. Sec.V

is devoted to the results obtained theoretically for three diatomics N2, O2 and CO which

are compared with experiments. The paper is concluded in Sec. VI.

II. C-NUMBER QUANTUM LANGEVIN EQUATION AND NORMAL MODE

We consider a particle of mass µ coupled to a medium comprised of a set of harmonic

oscillators with frequency ωi. This is described by the following Hamiltonian6:

is the set of co-ordinate and momentum operators for the reservoir oscillators of mass mi

{

coupled linearly to the system through their coupling coeﬃcients ci. The potential V (ˆq) is

due to the external force ﬁeld for the Brownian particle. The co-ordinate and momentum
operators follow the usual commutation relations [ˆq, ˆp] = i~ and [ˆxi, ˆpj] = i~δij.

Eliminating the reservoir degrees of freedom in the usual way we obtain the operator

that the ansatz (2.11) is a canonical thermal Wigner distribution19 for a shifted harmonic

oscillator which remains always a positive deﬁnite function. A special advantage of using

this distribution is that it remains valid as pure state non-singular distribution function at

T = 0. Furthermore, this procedure allows us to bypass the operator ordering prescription

of Eq.(2.6) for deriving the noise properties of the bath in terms of ﬂuctuation-dissipation

relation and to identify f (t) as a classical looking noise with quantum mechanical content.

The procedure has been used by us in several recent contexts20,21,22,23,24,25,26.

We now return to Eq.(2.10) to add the force term V ′(

represents the quantum correction due to the system degrees of freedom. Eq.(2.16) oﬀers

a simple interpretation. This implies that the quantum Langevin equation is governed by a

c-number quantum noise f (t) originating from the heat bath characterized by the properties

(2.13) and (2.14) and a quantum ﬂuctuation term Q(t) characteristic of the non-linearity of

the potential.

III. QUANTUM VIBRATIONAL DEPHASING RATE FOR A CUBIC OSCILLA-

TOR

It has already been established2,3,4 that harmonic oscillator model is not suﬃcient for

a quantitative description of vibrational dephasing rate. The essential paradigm for the

Here f is a constant due to cubic nonlinearity. With Eq.(3.1) the full Hamiltonian

where we have used Oxtoby’s notation, k111 = f /6µ3/2 and relations (2.27) and (2.28).

Here the ﬁrst term denotes the normal mode Hamiltonian for the harmonic potential and

the second term corresponds to classical nonlinear part of the potential.

In addition to

a constant shift of quantum origin third term signiﬁes the quantum corrections to system

normal mode where nonlinearity and quantum eﬀects are entangled.

In what follows we

show that this term provides a substantial contribution to the vibrational dephasing rate.

The anharmonicity in the potential shifts the minimum and the frequency of the system

normal mode so that by applying the usual condition

This is the general expression for quantum vibrational dephasing rate. The essential

content of this formulae in addition to the usual ﬁrst term obtained earlier by Levine et al 6

is the second term signifying the quantum contribution to dephasing rate arising out of the

nonlinearity of the system potential. This term is independent of the quantum nature of

the thermal bath. An evaluation of this term requires the explicit calculation of the integral

over quantum correction term B2(t) which we pursue in the next section. Keeping in view

of the fact that J(ω) does not involve a speciﬁc choice of form for density of bath modes,

we ﬁnd that the expression for the dephasing rate as derived above is fairly general.

The above method is based on the normal mode Hamiltonian of Pollak29 adopted to

a c-number description. An analysis of pure dephasing of a nonlinear vibrational mode

has been worked out earlier to calculate non-Markovian line shape by Georgievskii and

Stuchebrukhov5 using normal mode Hamiltonian treated by thermodynamic Green’s func-

tion approach. While the basis of present calculation of dephasing rate is Eq.(3.7), the

authors of Ref.5 have taken recourse to a diﬀerent strategy to calculate the line shape. The

diﬀerences in formulations and starting Hamiltonians (In Ref[5] a Leggett-Caldeira form of

Hamiltonian, i.e., Eq.(2.1) without a counter term has also been employed) notwithstand-

ing, the eﬀect of a quantum contribution to dephasing width related to anharmonicity of the

oscillator has been calculated in both Ref[5] and present analysis. The eﬀect is due to the

fact that the frequency of fundamental transition of a quantum nonlinear oscillator diﬀers

from harmonic frequency. To this end a continuation of the present analysis to calculate the

associated frequency shift is instructive for comparison with those of others5,6. For this we

return to the expression (3.5) for instantaneous frequency λ0(t), which after keeping terms

IV. CALCULATION OF THE QUANTUM CORRECTION DUE TO NONLIN-

EARITY OF THE SYSTEM POTENTIAL

It has already been pointed out that a leading order quantum correction due to nonlin-

earity of the potential of the system provides an important contribution over and above the

usual expression for dephasing rate. To calculate this term explicitly we now return to the

operator equation (2.2) and use (2.18) and (2.19) to obtain

worked out as discussed in detail in Refs.[18-24].

V. VIBRATIONAL DEPHASING RATE; COMPARISON WITH EXPERIMENTS

AND DISCUSSION

Having obtained the explicit expression for the leading order contribution B2(t) from

Eq.4.15 we are now in a position to write down the total quantum vibrational dephasing

rate. To this end we make use of Eq.4.15 in the second term and Eq.(4.9) in ﬁrst term of

the expression (3.12) and obtain, after some algebra,

The expression (5.1) is the central result of this paper. We already pointed out that κ2 is

is important to note that κ1 incorporates quantum eﬀect due to heat bath only. Although

16

both κ1 and κ2 are dependent on nonlinearity, κ2 vanishes in the classical limit and is also

independent of temperature. The temperature dependence of the dephasing rate is due to

the ﬁrst term κ1 of Eq.(5.2). It is important to note that at very low temperature as the
~ω, the temperature independent vacuum
integrand 1

~ω coth(~ω/2kBT ) in κ1 reduces to 1

limit, one observes that the dephasing caused by anharmonicity of the vibrational mode

does not vanish even at absolute zero because of the contributions of these two terms. This

aspect of temperature independence of the width of the transition from the ground state

had been noted earlier in Ref.[5]. The origin of the temperature independence in κ2 and the

nature of dephasing may be traced to the second term in Eq.(3.8) which results from the

third term of the normal mode Hamiltonian Eq.(3.2). This term contains the quantum con-

tribution to nonlinear potential explicitly calculated in terms of B2(t) in Sec.IV. This lowest

order quantum ﬂuctuation (or uncertainty) is independent of the quantum character of the

heat bath and also temperature and causes frequency ﬂuctuation leading to dephasing and

therefore a homogeneous broadening of the transition similar to natural linewidth. In order

to assess the relative contribution of the two terms in the total dephasing rate we estimate

the numerical magnitude of these two quantities as well as the dephasing time for three

diatomic molecules, N2, O2 and CO and compare them with experimental results obtained

from either picosecond pump-probe technique14 or from Raman linewidth measurement of

liquids using interferometric techniques12,13,15,16,17. We have also studied the rate as a func-

tion of temperature away from critical point or triple point of these liquids and compared

with experiments.

The values of the parameters essential for calculation of the dephasing rate using formulae

(5.1) are given in the Table 1. Apart from mass µ, frequency of the fundamental ω0, size r,

at a temperature T two sensitive parameters are the static friction due to the liquid, γ, and

the anharmonic force constant k111. Although use of local viscosity which formally takes

into account of wave vector dependence of the viscosity for the size of the probe has been

advocated for calculation of friction, we conﬁne ourselves to standard Stoke’s expression (γ =

6πηr/µ, η being viscosity coeﬃcient of the liquid). For diatomics we determine k111 from the
spectroscopic constants αe and Be using7,30 k111 =

). The integrals in (5.2)

~ω2

are calculated numerically for all the three cases. The magnitudes of κ1 and κ2 are shown

separately in the table along with the percentage contribution of κ2 in the total dephasing

rate κdep. Three pertinent points are to be noted. First, it is well known that classical

17

dephasing rate (i.e. κ1 in the classical limit) is higher than the corresponding quantum

rate κ1. This is somewhat reminiscent of the quantum supression of classical values of rate

co-eﬃcient for the thermally activated processes for shallow cubic potentials31. Second, it

is evident that just as in the classical theory, anharmonicity contributes signiﬁcantly to

the total quantum dephasing rate. In case of N2 it is as large as

26.5 percent of total

∼

dephasing rate. The dephasing time thus calculated corresponds fairly to that obtained

from experiments. Third, the quantum eﬀects due to heat bath appears quite signiﬁcantly

through the integrals in κ1. This is because, the frequency dependence of the integrand
is quite sharp at around ω0 as a result of the the frequency denominator (ω2

The temperature dependence of the dephasing rate according to Eq.(5.1) has been com-

pared for the set of parameter values mentioned in the Table 1 to that obtained from

experiments16,17 in Fig.1 for the molecules N2, O2 and CO. While the experimental results

span a wide range of temperatures covering triple point and critical point, we conﬁne our-

selves in the region away from the points of phase transition, since the present theory is

outside the scope of phase transition. We ﬁnd a linear dependence of dephasing rate on

temperature which is a fair agreement with experimental observations16,17.

VI. CONCLUSION

Based on a quantum Langevin equation and the corresponding Hamiltonian formulation

within a c-number description, we have calculated quantum vibrational dephasing rate for

a cubic oscillator system using ﬁrst order perturbation technique and compared the results

with experiments. It is shown that the vibrational dephasing rate comprises of two terms.

The ﬁrst term is the standard expression obtained earlier by several workers using inde-
~ ω0. This term is

pendent approaches and is reduces to its classical limit as kB T

≫

responsible for ﬁnite temperature dependence of the dephasing rate. The second term, an

essential content and oﬀshoot of the present theory, is a leading quantum correction due to

nonlinearity of the system potential which contributes quite eﬀectively to the total dephas-

ing rate. Keeping in view of this observation, we believe that this quantum correction term

is likely to play a signiﬁcant role in triatomic and polyatomic molecules as well.

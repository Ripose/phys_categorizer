In the present work we investigate the adequacy of broken-symmetry (BS) unrestricted (U) den-
sity functional theory (DFT) for constructing the potential energy curve of nickel dimer and nickel
hydride, as model for larger bare and hydrogenated nickel cluster calculations. We use three hybrid
functionals: the popular B3LYP, Becke’s newest optimized functional Becke98, and the simple FS-
LYP functional (50% Hartree-Fock and 50% Slater exchange and LYP gradient-corrected correlation
functional) with two basis sets: all-electron (AE) Wachters+f basis set and Stuttgart RSC eﬀective
core potential (ECP) and basis set. We ﬁnd that, overall, B3LYP functional with Wachters+f AE
basis set performs best, with only 1.3% root-mean-square (RMS) deviation from experiment. The
Becke98 functional with Wachters+f AE basis set and B3LYP with Stuttart RSC ECP basis set
are comparable to the high-level CASPT2 (second-order perturbation theory with a complete ac-
tive space self-consistent ﬁeld reference function) method, with RMS deviation from experimental
value of 2.5%, 2.7%, and 2.6%, respectively. FSLYP/AE follows with 3.5% RMS deviation from
experimental value and FSLYP/ECP with 7%. (The reported RMS deviations are calculated as
the root-mean-squares of the relative deviations from the experimental values of the bond length,
dissociation energy, and vibrational frequency for both Ni2 and NiH, and the dipole moment for
NiH.) We also ﬁnd that for Ni2, the spin-projection for the broken-symmetry unrestricted singlet
states changes the ordering of the states, but the splittings are less than 10 meV. All our calcula-
tions predict a δδ-hole ground state for Ni2 and δ-hole ground state for NiH. Upon spin-projection

INTRODUCTION

During the last decades clusters have been extensively
studied because of their potential applications, their the-
oretical value in understanding the transition from iso-
lated atomic systems to condensed matter [1, 2] and their
relevance to the study of surface processes and heteroge-
neous catalysis [3–5]. The rapid development of exper-
imental techniques in recent years has made it possible
both to obtain size-controlled transition metal clusters
and to study their reactivity against chemisorption pro-
cesses [6–9].

Methods for studying properties and behavior of clus-
ters have been developed, and a review on computa-
tional studies of clusters has been written by Freeman
and Doll [10]. There have been many studies on nickel

clusters using various methods of exploring the potential
energy surfaces (PES). The construction of such poten-
tial surfaces is a major problem, especially for transition
metal clusters. Many methods have been used to con-
struct PES’s for nickel clusters, ranging from empirical
— Finis-Sinclair type [11, 12], semi-empirical — tight
binding [13, 14] and extended H¨uckel [15], to ab initio
or mixed empirical–ab initio [16] approaches. Recently,
there have been studies of hydrogen atoms on Cu sur-
faces [17] within the density functional framework.
It
has been found that semiempirical methods are insuﬃ-
cient for accurate description of such systems, and ﬁrst
principle quantum-mechanical methods are needed to ob-
tain a proper description of the hydrogen binding site.

Our long-term goal is to explore the structure and dy-
namics of clusters, including nickel and nickel hydride
systems. The combination of the physical complexity
and the computational demands of these systems neces-
sitate that the microscopic force laws that are utilized in
such simulations be both eﬃcient and reliable.

Among the correlated electronic structure methods the
best candidate is clearly density functional theory (DFT)
because of its ability of reaching high accuracy — similar

to coupled-cluster CCSD(T) method for second-row ele-
ments — when hybrid exchange-correlation functionals
are used [18]. Moreover, DFT (using hybrid function-
als) is computationally not much more expensive than
Hartree-Fock.

While there have been a number of DFT calculations
reported on small nickel clusters [19–26], some results
appear to be inconsistent both with respect to available
experimental data and/or with respect to other theoret-
ical predictions.

The works of Yanagisawa et al. [27] and Barden et
al. [28] on the performance of DFT on the ﬁrst transi-
tion metal series have shown that non-hybrid functionals
(BLYP [29, 30], BP86 [29, 31, 32], BOP [29, 33] and
PW91 [34]) and hybrid functionals (B3LYP [30, 35], BH-
LYP [30, 36]) give an overall similar description for 3d
transition metal dimers, with the non-hybrid ones giving
better bond lengths and the hybrid ones better dissocia-
tion energies. However, while Yanagisawa et al. [27] ob-
tain good agreement with experiment for nickel dimer for
all studied exchange-correlation functionals (they only
calculated the triplet states), Barden et al. [28] obtained
a negative dissociation energy for their calculated singlet
ground state with the B3LYP functional (and negative
or very close to zero for all hybrid exchange-correlation
functionals). This prompted us to use symmetry break-
ing in unrestricted DFT for describing the lowest singlet
state of nickel dimer. With larger cluster calculations in
mind, we also used broken symmetry unrestricted DFT
to better describe bond breaking in all states of nickel
dimer and nickel hydride.

It has been argued that broken-symmetry unrestricted
calculations (Hartree-Fock and DFT with hybrid func-
tionals) are useful for describing systems with weakly
coupled electron pairs [18, 37–42]. Ni2 is deﬁnitely
such a case, as previously observed by Basch et al. [19].
As argued by Cremer [18], the combination of hybrid
exchange-correlation functional with symmetry breaking
leads to a better description of systems in which static
correlation is present than does the restricted DFT for-
malism. Finally, we believe that the formalism used to
describe any system is solely dictated by the objective of
the calculation. For a variational approach, and DFT
can be regarded as such — aside from the exchange-
correlation functional, — the more ﬂexible is the form
of the trial function (density), the lower is the obtained
energy. Since our interest is mainly in the energetics of
nickel clusters, the best choice for us seems to be the un-
restricted broken symmetry DFT approach with hybrid
functionals.

In the present work we study the nickel dimer and
nickel hydride using broken symmetry unrestricted DFT
with hybrid exchange-correlation functionals — mainly
the popular B3LYP [30, 35] — as model systems for
larger bare and hydrogenated nickel clusters in an at-
tempt to establish what might comprise a minimally re-
liable method for more extensive nickel cluster calcula-
tions.

The outline of the reminder of the present paper is as
follows: Section II contains discussions the methods used,
Section III presents the results of the calculations, and,
where possible, comparisons with previous reports. Sec-
tion IV concludes with suggestions for further research
based on the present ﬁndings.

II. COMPUTATIONAL DETAILS

The DFT calculations reported in this paper are car-
ried out with NWChem [43] computational chemistry
package, using the unrestricted Kohn-Sham approach, al-
lowing for symmetry breaking, and using a ﬁnite orbital
(spherical Gaussian) basis set expansion and charge den-
sity ﬁtting.

Hartree-Fock (HF) and second order Møller-Plesset
(MP2) calculations are performed for comparison for
the states of the Ni atom and are done in unrestricted
form.[73]

i

Throughout the paper we will use the notation
M (hAhB) for the states of nickel dimer, where M is the
multiplicity, hA and hB are the unoccupied (hole) or-
bitals in the 3d shell on the two Ni atoms, denoted A and
B. The broken symmetry singlet states (with Sz = 0 and
S2
h

= 1) are denoted by 1,3(hAhB).

In general, an unrestricted Slater or Kohn-Sham deter-
minant is not an eigenfunction of the total spin operator
S2, and the results can only be characterized by the num-
ber of α and β electrons. However, following common
usage, we refer to the states that diﬀer in the number
of α and β electrons by 0 as singlets, by 1 as doublets,
and so on. We explicitly identify pure spin states where
relevant.

A. Exchange-Correlation Functionals

We used three hybrid exchange-correlation function-
als: the very popular B3LYP — composed of the B3,
Becke’s three-parameter hybrid exchange functional [35]
and LYP [30] correlation functional — is the ﬁrst choice
because it is well known and extensively characterized.
Becke’s newest optimized functional, Becke98 [44] is also
used, since it is supposed to be, in a certain sense, the
best obtainable exchange-correlation functional within
the gradient-corrected framework. The hybrid composed
of half Slater exchange [45], half Hartree-Fock exchange
and LYP [30] correlation, named here FSLYP is also
used for comparison, as it is the simplest theoretically-
justiﬁable hybrid method and is reported to perform
rather well [40, 41].

B. Basis sets

All calculations are performed with spherical basis sets.
As all-electron (AE) basis sets, Wachters+f basis set [46–

49], a [14s11p6d3f ]/(8s6p4d1f ) contraction is used for
nickel and 6-311++G(2d,2p), a [6s2p]/(4s2p) contraction
for hydrogen.

Eﬀective-core potentials (ECP) are also explored, since
they greatly reduce computational cost. Stuttgart RSC
ECP eﬀective core potentials basis set [50, 51] are used
for nickel, as they provide a similar quality of valence
basis functions as Wachters+f.

Ahlrichs Coulomb Fitting [52, 53] basis is used as a
charge density ﬁtting basis, as it signiﬁcantly reduces
computing time, especially for larger systems, the type
of study of that represents our long-term goal. When
not speciﬁed otherwise, all reported results are obtained
using charge density ﬁtting. Please refer to Appendix A
for discussion of the accuracy of charge density ﬁtting.

C. Numerical integration and convergence

The numerical integration necessary for the evalua-
tion of the exchange-correlation energy implemented in
NWChem uses an Euler-MacLaurin scheme for the radial
components (with a modiﬁed Mura-Knowles transforma-
tion) and a Lebedev scheme for the angular components.
We use three levels of accuracy for the numerical inte-
gration that are used in our DFT calculations, labeled
by the corresponding keywords from NWChem (medium,
fine and xfine).

The reported atomic calculations are those obtained
with the xfine grid. For geometry optimization and vi-
brational frequency calculations we use the fine grid.
And for the potential energy curve (PEC) scans we used
the medium grid. The maximum number of iterations is
set to 100 in all calculations.

Please refer to Appendix B for details on numerical

integration and convergence criteria.

D. Geometry optimization

Harmonic vibrational frequencies are calculated using
NWChem’s VIB module with the default options. Since
analytical Hessian for open shell systems is not available
for the used exchange-correlation functionals, the Hessian

F. Spin and Symmetry Projection

In general, an open-shell Slater or Kohn-Sham determi-
nant is not an eigenfunction of the total spin operator S2.
However, spin-adapted conﬁgurations can be obtained as
combinations of (a small number of) restricted determi-
nants [56, 57]. Unrestricted determinants are not eigen-
function of the total spin operator S2, either, and they
cannot be spin-adapted by combining a small number
of unrestricted determinants [56]. However, for antifer-
romagnetic coupling of two weakly interacting identical
high spin monomers, Noodleman [38] derived an approx-
imate spin projection scheme that is correct to the ﬁrst
order in the overlap integrals. Ni2 can be well approxi-
mated by such a model.

As previously observed by Basch et al. [19], the elec-
tronic structure of nickel clusters corresponds roughly to
a model in which the 3d electrons can be viewed as weakly
interacting localized 3d9 units bound together primarily
by 4s electrons.
If the 4s electrons are paired in a σ
bond, then Ni2 has two possible spin states: singlet and
triplet. However, the open-shell singlet state can not
be represented by a single determinant, and the broken-
symmetry single determinant ΨB obtained by putting
one of the open-shell electrons in a spin α d orbital on
one of the Ni atoms and the other electron in a spin β d
orbital on the other Ni atom is not pure singlet, but an
equal mixture of singlet and triplet (using
nota-
tion for the spin states):

for the broken symmetry calculations of the Sz = 0

the broken-symmetry mixed state, and for the triplet
(Sz = 1) state,
is close to the exact value of 2 (in
both cases, the relative absolute diﬀerences between
the computed and the exact values are less than 2%).
Mulliken population analysis also supports the weakly
interacting 3d9 units model. For the triplet nickel dimer
there is a Mulliken spin population of 1.00 on each Ni
atom, and for the broken symmetry singlet there is a
Mulliken spin population of 1.1 on one of the Ni atoms
and

1.1 on the other.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

A. Nickel Atom

The ground state of the nickel atom is 3F4(3d84s2) [54,
65]. However, since our calculations do not include spin-
orbit coupling, we use weighted averages over the J com-
ponents of the experimental data for comparison, which
makes 3D(3d94s1) the ground state, with 3F (3d84s2)
state only 0.03 eV higher, and 1S(3d10) state 1.74 eV
above the ground state.

As ﬁrst estimated by Martin and Hay [55] and con-
ﬁrmed by full relativistic calculations done by Jeng and
Hsue [66] the relativistic eﬀects in the 3d transition metal
series are important. Therefore, in comparing our non-
relativistic calculations with the experiment we take such
eﬀects into account by subtracting the estimated values
reported by Martin and Hay from the experimental val-
ues. After this correction (see Table I for details), the
ground state remains 3D, with 3F state 0.39 eV higher,
and 1S state 1.53 eV above the ground state. These val-
ues will be referred to as “relativistically corrected (RC)
experimental values.”

In Table I we choose to utilize the Martin and Hay [55]
relativistic corrections as opposed to the ones computed
by Jeng and Hsue [66] because they include the addi-
tional 1S(3d10) conﬁguration. The results of the recent
relativistic calculations in the RESC approximation (rel-
ativistic scheme by eliminating small components) re-
ported by Yanagisawa et al. [27] do not lend themselves
to an analysis of relativistic corrections. Moreover, these
calculations seem to be at odds with the two previous
calculations.

The all electron calculations with the very sim-
ple exchange-correlation functional FSLYP predicts 3F
ground state with a 3D – 3F splitting of only 0.12 eV,
the closest to experiment among the current calculations,
but the error in energy of 1S state is 0.9 eV, and on the
average the B3LYP and Becke98 results are clearly in
better overall agreement with the experiment.

The results obtained with eﬀective core potentials
(ECP’s), are discouraging for atoms; both the simpler
FSLYP on one hand and B3LYP and Becke98 on the
other predict a 3F ground state and all predict a 3D
3 F
splitting that is in rather large error compared to the RC
0.5 eV). The error in the energy

The bond lengths, dissociation energies and vibrational
frequencies for ground states of Ni2 from diﬀerent calcu-
lations are reported in Table II along with experimental
values and results from other theoretical studies. Since
our calculations are non-relativistic and do not include
spin-orbit coupling, and spin-orbit deperturbed values of
molecular properties of interest for Ni2 are not available
in the literature, we have subtracted the CASPT2 val-
ues from Ref. 60 for the relativistic correction and spin-
orbit contribution from the experimental dissociation en-
ergy. Because we do not perform the full deperturbation
treatment, we cannot correct the values of vibrational
frequency and bond length, but the estimated correc-
tions using the CASPT2 values from Ref. 60 are less than

≈

0.5%.
The reported singlet states from our calculations are
spin-projected by the approximate method described in
Section II (Computational details). For details on the
accuracy of the projections please refer to Appendix C.
The results presented in Table II are listed in the order of

decreasing RMS deviations from the experimental values,
calculated as root-mean-squares of relative deviations in
de, D0 and ωe. Overall, for Ni2 the all-electron DFT
calculations with B3LYP functional give the best agree-
ment with experiment, followed closely by a narrow group
formed by (in increasing order) CASSCF/IC-ACPF,
FSLYP/AE, Becke98/AE, CASPT2, and B3LYP/ECP.
With 15% RMS deviation from the experimental values,
the FSLYP/ECP calculation gives the largest disagree-
ment with experiment and the other methods. ECP com-
putations have larger RMS deviations from experimental
values than the corresponding AE ones, mainly because
of the large error in De. The large errors in De are a con-
sequence of the wrong ordering of atomic states in these
calculations, and because we compute the dissociation
energies relative to ground state atoms.

For the results from FSLYP/ECP computation, the
splitting between the (dA
x2−y2) states,
both for triplet and for mixed Sz = 0, is larger (8 meV)
than the accuracy of the DFT calculations (better than
0.1 meV). Thus, our approximate spin and symmetry
projections are questionable for these particular calcula-
tions, and we did not perform them.

ACPF predicts 1Γg ground state. Our DFT all-electron

function methods. The experimental results are consis-

and CASPT2, but not with the 1Γg state predicted by
CASSCF/IC-ACPF.

It is important to note (see Table III) that for each
combination of exchange-correlation functional and basis
set used, all δδ-hole states are in a very narrow energy
range:
20 meV for all all-electron calculations, 10 meV
for B3LYP/ECP and 26 meV for FSLYP/ECP.

All theoretical calculations predict bond lengths that
are less than 10% longer than the experimental value.
All-electon calculations with Becke98 and B3LYP func-
tionals give bond lengths that are about 6.5% longer than
the experiment, similar to CASSCF/IA-ACPF. The FS-
LYP functional (both AE and ECP) calculations gave
bond lengths slightly closer to the experimental values,
as do the B3LYP/ECP calculation. CASPT2 is clearly
in closer agreement with the experiment. However, there
is a clear tendency of all compared methods, both DFT
and wavefunction, to overestimate the bond length of
Ni2 compared with the experimental value. We specu-
late that this overestimate could be either a relativistic
eﬀect or an experimental error.

The diﬀerences in the theoretical vibrational frequen-
cies compared to the experimental ones are surprisingly

small, with CASPT2 having the largest diﬀerence among
the results listed in Table II.

With respect to the dissociation energy, B3LYP is
in excellent agreement with the experiment (within
0.01 eV), which is fortuitous since for the G2 set of
molecules the errors in the B3LYP dissociation energies
average 0.10 eV, with a maximum absolute deviation of
0.36 eV [67]. Becke98 and CASPT2 are in good agree-
ment with each other and with experiment, both overes-
timating the dissociation energy by 12% and 6%, respec-
tively. FSLYP is similar to CASSCF/IC-ACPF, both

underestimating the dissociation energy by about 10%.
Moreover, as explained above, ECP dissociation energies
are too small, compared with experiment, because the
3D state that correlates with the computed dd-hole states
of Ni2 is higher than the predicted 3F ground state, as
shown in Table I.

The results of the DFT calculations of nickel dimer re-
ported in this paper give bond lengths that are 4% up
to 7% longer than the experimental values, and in good
agreement with the high-level wavefunction methods
CASPT2[60] and CASSCF/IC-ACPF[61]. The agree-
ment with experiment for the vibrational frequency of
Ni2 is even better; all our DFT calculations predicting
values within less than 5% of the experimental value.
All our DFT calculations predict dissociation energies
within 15% of the experimental value, in good agree-
ment with CASPT2 and CASSCF/IC-ACPF, except for
FSLYP/ECP, whose predicted D0 value is signiﬁcantly
diﬀerent from the experimental one.

x2−y2dB

The bond lengths of optimized geometries, dissocia-
tion energies and vibrational frequencies for the low-
est singlet (both spin-projected and unprojected) and
triplet states calculated with the described DFT meth-
ods are tabulated in Table III for comparison. The states
from each calculation are listed in the order of increas-
ing dissociation energies. The ﬁrst observation is that
the spin projection changes the ordering of the singlet
states for all three all-electron calculations. For these
calculations, the lowest energy is obtained for the un-
projected singlet 1,3(dA
xy) state, and upon projec-
tion, 1(dA
x2−y2dB
x2−y2) becomes the ground state. For the
B3LYP/ECP calculation spin-projection does not change
the 3(dA
x2−y2dB
xy) ground state. For FSLYP/ECP the
1(dA
xydB
xy) ground state is obtained by projection from
1,3(dA
xydB
xy), which is the lowest unprojected state. How-
ever, as mentioned above, our approximate spin and sym-
metry projections are questionable for these particular
calculations because the splitting between the (dA
xy)
and (dA
x2−y2) states, both for triplet and for mixed
Sz = 0, is larger (8 meV) than the numerical accuracy
of the DFT calculations (better than 0.1 meV). Since,
as shown above, the ordering of states can change upon
spin-projection, if possible to perform, spin-projection
is desirable. However, we want to emphasize that the
diﬀerences between the lowest broken-symmetry singlet
states and the projected singlet ground states, for the
all-electron calculations and FSLYP/ECP, is less than
10 meV, and for some applications that diﬀerence may
not be relevant. Nevertheless, we plan to consider spin-
projection for larger clusters, if possible, at least for eval-
uating the errors that arise from it.

In order to determine the ground state of Ni2 we did
a full scan of the PEC for each method and for each
unique combination of holes. All calculations predict
δδ-hole states to have the lowest energy, with the next
level 50–100 meV above, σδ for Becke98 and B3LYP cal-
culations and πδ for FSLYP calculations.

7

The computations of σπ states with Becke98 and
B3LYP functionals only converge to 10−5–10−4 Hartree
within 100 iterations in the 1.95–2.55 ˚A range. Because
the FSLYP calculations, which converge properly, pre-
dict that these states are
200 meV higher, the same
≈
value as the “not-so-converged” results for the above cal-
culations, we have chosen not investigate the matter any
further.

Since the results of the PEC scans are rather similar,
and B3LYP is our functional of choice, in the following
discussion of the PEC’s, we focus attention principally
on the results from B3LYP calculations.

The B3LYP/AE and B3LYP/ECP potential energy

states of Ni2 (both unrestricted, symmetry broken) are
shown in Fig. 1 and in Fig. 2, respectively, along with the
variation of
with the bond length for all possible po-
sitions of holes in the 3d shell on both atoms, grouped
by hole type. The ﬁrst trend that can be noticed is that
the equilibrium bond length increases as the dissociation
energy decreases. Aside for a few states (singlet σσ and
ππ), all states have

dating the weakly interacting 3d9 units model for a large
range of bond lengths. Even the singlet σσ and ππ states

One can notice a big diﬀerence between AE and ECP
PEC’s: ECP PEC’s branch around 3.5 ˚A. There are
two causes for branching: one, which is not related
to functional [74] or ECP, is the restricted–unrestricted
crossover, while the other cause is dissociation into 3F
ground state of Ni atoms. These two eﬀects overlap be-
cause the branching is obtained by scanning the PEC
3.5 ˚A, increasing the bond length and using as
from
initial guess the molecular orbitals from the previous cal-
culation. Depending on the initial guess, the calculation
may end in the restricted or unrestricted solution, or,
at large distances, the calculation may converge to the
3F +3 F , 3F +3 D or 3D +3 D states of the Ni atoms.
The restricted-unrestricted branching is likely to show up
for any of the methods, but the ground-state branching
can only appear for the methods that predict 3F ground
state for Ni, namely FSLYP/AE and FSLYP/ECP along
with the discussed B3LYP/ECP.

gives the same results, but the method using atomic ini-
tial guess needs a few extra iterations. For larger cluster
calculations it may be useful to save the molecular or-
bitals at each geometry conﬁguration and try to reuse
them for a neighboring point calculation.

It is apparent from Fig. 1 that for the B3LYP/AE

The bond lengths, dissociation energies and vibrational
frequencies for ground states of NiH from diﬀerent calcu-
lations are reported in Table IV along with experimental
values and results from other theoretical studies. The
experimental values are taken from Ref. 60, and are the
results of deperturbation treatment of Gray et al.[68],
where available.

The results presented in Table IV are listed in the or-
der of decreasing RMS deviations from the experimental
values, calculated as root-mean-squares of relative devia-
tions in de, De, ωe and µ. For NiH, the best overall agree-
ment with experiment is obtained for B3LYP/AE with
1% RMS deviation from the experimental values, closely
followed by B3LYP/ECP, CASPT2 and Becke98/AE.
FSLYP/ECP and FSLYP/AE give the largest RMS de-
viations for the computed molecular constants of NiH,
but the diﬀerences are still less than 3%.

All theoretical calculations predict bond lengths that
diﬀer by less than 2% from the experimental value. All

≤

all-electon calculations give bond lengths that are longer
than the experimental value by 1.1% to 1.6%, the largest
deviation from the experiment. CASPT2 predicts a
shorter bond length than the experiment, by 1%. The
ECP calculations predict the most accurate bond lengths
for NiH, with only 0.1% and -0.2% deviation from the
experimental values for B3LYP and FSLYP functionals,
respectively.

The diﬀerences in the theoretical vibrational frequen-
cies compared to the experimental values are less than
3% for our DFT calculations, with the best agreement
obtained again for the ECP calculations. CASPT2 has
the largest diﬀerence from the experimental value among
the results listed in Table IV.

With respect to the dissociation energy, B3LYP/AE is
in excellent agreement with experiment (within 0.16 eV),
in the expected range of errors for B3LYP (see the dis-
cussion at Ni2). Becke98/AE and CASPT2 are again in
excellent agreement with each other, but both overesti-
mate the dissociation energy by 0.2 eV. FSLYP/AE and
the two ECP calculations give the best agreement with
the experiment. The same tendency of underestimating
the dissociation energy, which gives the worst agreement
with experiment for Ni2, helps these methods overcome
the general trend observed for all methods to overesti-
mate the stability of the bound state for this system.

For NiH the dipole moment can be expected to
be a more sensitive measure of the quality of the
method [60], and a comparison of the theoretical and
experimental values of the dipole moment shows that
B3LYP/AE gives the best agreement, closely followed by
CASPT2. Becke98/AE overestimates the dipole moment
and B3LYP/ECP underestimates it by similar amounts
8%) and the FSLYP functional overestimates it by
(
≈
10% and 21% with ECP and AE basis sets, respectively.
These results indicate that B3LYP functional with
Wachters+f basis set gives the best prediction of molec-
ular constants of NiH (dissociation energy, bond length,
vibrational frequency and dipole moment), within less
than 6% of the experimental values, followed closely by
B3LYP/ECP and Becke98/AE and also CASPT2 with
a maximum deviation of less than 8%, then followed by

IV. CONCLUSION

We have used DFT with hybrid exchange-correlation
functionals in the broken-symmetry unrestricted for-
malism to study the electronic structure of nickel
dimer and nickel hydride as model systems for larger
bare/hydrogenated nickel clusters. We have examined
three hybrid functionals: the popular B3LYP, Becke’s
newest optimized functional Becke98, and the simple
FSLYP functional (50% Hartree-Fock and 50% Slater
exchange and LYP gradient-corrected correlation func-
tional) with two basis sets: all-electron (AE) Wachters+f
basis set and Stuttgart RSC eﬀective core potential
(ECP) and basis set.

In Table V we list the root-mean-square (RMS) and
maximum (max) relative deviations of the computational
results from the experimental values for both Ni2 and
NiH. The listed values are the root-mean-square and the
maximum of the relative deviations of de, D0 and ωe for
Ni2, and of de, De, ωe, and µ for NiH.

Our results indicate that, overall, B3LYP functional
with Wachters+f AE basis set performs best, with only
1.3% root-mean-square (RMS) and 6.4% maximum devi-
ation from experimental value. The Becke98 functional
with Wachters+f AE basis set and B3LYP with Stut-
tart RSC ECP basis set are comparable with the high-
level CASPT2 method, with an RMS deviation from ex-
perimental value of 2.5%, 2.7%, and 2.6%, respectively
and maximum deviations of 12%, 16%, and 13%, respec-
tively. FSLYP/AE follows with 3.5% RMS and 21%
maximum deviation from experimental value and FS-
LYP/ECP with 7% RMS and 46% maximum.

The B3LYP/AE and FSLYP/AE approaches have the
lowest discrepancy between Ni2 and NiH RMS deviations
from the experimental values, on the order of 1%, but
only B3LYP/AE is consistent between Ni2 and NiH with
respect to maximum deviation, 6.4% and 5.8%, respec-

10

tively. Becke98 and B3LYP are next, with similar RMS
diﬀerence as CASPT2, on the order of 3–4%, and FS-
LYP/ECP treats NiH much better than Ni2.

There is a clear tendency of all methods considered,
DFT and wavefunction, to overestimate the bond length
of Ni2 (see Table II) compared with the experimental
value. We speculate that this overestimate could be ei-
ther a relativistic eﬀect or an experimental error.

xydB

We also ﬁnd that for Ni2, the spin-projection for the
broken-symmetry unrestricted singlet states changes the
ordering of the states, but the splittings are less than
10 meV. All our calculations predict a δδ-hole ground
state for Ni2 and δ-hole ground state for NiH. Upon spin-
projection of the singlet state of Ni2, all AE calculations
g or 1Γg ground state for Ni2, B3LYP/ECP
predict 1Σ+
g or 3Γu and FSLYP/ECP predicts singlet
predicts a 3Σ−
(dA
xy)-hole ground state (about which more cannot be
said because of the symmetry contamination). The dou-
blet δ-hole ground state of NiH predicted by all our calcu-
lations is in agreement with the experimentally predicted
2∆ ground state. For Ni2, all our results are consistent
with the experimentally predicted ground state of 0+
g (a
mixture of 1Σ+
g ) or 0−
u and
3Σ+

u ).
Our results indicate that DFT, with the B3LYP [35]
hybrid exchange-correlation functional
in the broken-
symmetry unrestricted formalism, becomes both an eﬃ-
cient and reliable method for predicting electronic struc-
ture of our model Ni2 and NiH systems.

APPENDIX A: ACCURACY OF CHARGE
DENSITY FITTING

As stated in Section II we use charge density ﬁtting, for
which we employ the Ahlrichs Coulomb Fitting [52, 53]
basis set. For evaluating the error introduced by charge
density ﬁtting we perform the atomic computations with
B3LYP functional and Wachters+f basis set with and
without charge density ﬁtting. The charge density ﬁtting
lowers the total energies of computed atomic states by

To be cautious, we have investigated this issue fur-
ther by comparing results of geometry optimizations
and frequency calculations on the 12 (dA

Ni2 (six singlet, broken symmetry, and six triplet) with
B3LYP/AE functional both with and without charge
density ﬁtting. The results are summarized in Table VI.

the order of a little less than 1 mHartree, as can be seen
in column labeled Ee/mHartree in Table VI), they all

Moreover, the errors in the relative energies (with respect
to the ground state Ni atom, labeled Ee/meV in Ta-
5 meV), and again all with
ble VI) are much smaller (

the same sign. Finally, the relative ordering of the states
is correct, and the root-mean-square of the relative en-
ergies with respect to the lowest energy state from each
calculation, labeled ∆Ee/meV in Table VI, is 0.03 meV
with a maximum of 0.12 meV. The maximum error due
to charge density ﬁtting to be expected in exploring the
PES’s of larger clusters is on the order of 2–3 meV per
Ni atom.

APPENDIX B: ACCURACY AND
CONVERGENCE ISSUES OF DFT
COMPUTATIONS

The numerical integration necessary for the evalua-
tion of the exchange-correlation energy implemented in
NWChem uses an Euler-MacLaurin scheme for the radial
components (with a modiﬁed Mura-Knowles transforma-
tion) and a Lebedev scheme for the angular components.
Table VII lists the grid and accuracy details for the three
levels of accuracy for the numerical integration that are
used in our DFT calculations, labeled by the correspond-
ing keywords from NWChem (medium, fine and xfine).
The convergence criteria used for each level of accuracy
of the numerical integration are diﬀerent and are listed
in Table VIII.

x2−y2dB

In order to assess the errors arising from numeri-
cal integration we have performed a series of computa-
tions using diﬀerent predeﬁned grid schemes available in
NWChem. First, we have performed the atomic calcula-
tions using both xfine and fine grids. The diﬀerences
are of the order of total energy target accuracy of the
fine grid (
10−7 Hartree). We also have compared
the all-electron DFT computations using B3LYP func-
tional with fine grid against the ones with xfine grid
for geometry optimization and frequency calculations for
Ni2, (dA
xy) singlet and triplet states. The diﬀer-
ences are on the order of 10−4 ˚A for equilibrium bond
10−6 Hartree for total equilibrium energy and
length, 2
0.2 cm−1 for vibrational frequency. We conclude that
the fine grid is appropriate for geometry optimization
and vibrational frequency calculations, and have used
it in the present work. For the potential energy curve
(PEC) scans we use the medium grid, which gives for a
19-point B3LYP/AE PEC scan in the range 2 . . . 3.2 ˚A
of Ni2 (dA
xy) singlet an error in energy of 16 µeV
(maximum) and 1.4 µeV (root-mean-square) with respect
to the fine grid computations.

APPENDIX C: ACCURACY OF SPIN AND
SYMMETRY PROJECTION

Since the bond lengths for the pure spin states are
diﬀerent from each other and from the mixed state, we
use a harmonic approximation of the potential around

E(d) = E(de) +

and solve the resulting equations for de, E(de) and ke for
the projected state.

In order to assess the accuracy of this procedure, we
estimate the errors resulting from neglecting third and
fourth degree terms in the above expansion. In Table IX
we report the averages of the estimated errors from ne-
glecting third and fourth degree terms of the PEC se-
ries expansion for the spin projection. The coeﬃcients
of the 3rd and the 4th degree terms have been estimated
from a least-square ﬁt of the terms of degree
3 of a
polynomial of 6th degree to 11 data points, those with
/ 0.25 ˚A from the coarse PEC scan for each case.

It is apparent from Table IX that the harmonic approx-
imation errors in energies are very small, on the order of
10−9 eV, which is beyond the numerical accuracy of the
10−6 eV). The errors in the equi-
DFT calculations (
librium distances are less than 10−4 ˚A, and the errors in
vibrational frequencies less than 0.1 cm−1. As stated in

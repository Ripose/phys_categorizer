We present linear response theories in the continuum capable of describing photoionization spec-
tra and dynamic polarizabilities of ﬁnite systems with no spatial symmetry. Our formulations are
based on the time-dependent local density approximation with uniform grid representation in the
three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate. Eﬀects of the continuum are taken into account either with
a Green’s function method or with a complex absorbing potential in a real-time method. The two
methods are applied to a negatively charged cluster in the spherical jellium model and to some small
molecules (silane, acetylene and ethylene).

I. INTRODUCTION

Oscillator strength distribution characterizes the opti-
cal response of atoms and molecules. Advances in mea-
surements with synchrotron radiation and high resolution
electron energy loss spectroscopy have enabled us to ob-
tain oscillator strength distribution of a whole spectral
region originated from valence electrons [1]. The photon
energy dependences of molecular photoelectron spectra
have also been measured. They provide useful informa-
tion about the dynamics of the photoionization processes.
Theoretical analysis of photoabsorption spectra above
the ﬁrst ionization threshold requires continuum elec-
tronic wave function in a non-spherical multi-center po-
tential. Several methods have been developed for this
purpose [2], including the continuum multiple scatter-
ing method [3], the Schwinger variational method [4,5],
ﬁnite-volume variational method [6], the linear algebraic
method [7], and the K-matrix method [8]. The Stieltjes
moment method does not directly utilize the scattering
state but extract continuum spectrum from the spectral
moments which are calculated with a square-integrable
basis set [9]. The method has been extensively applied
to large systems [10,11]. The complex basis method also
gives continuum spectra by the calculation with a square-
integrable basis set [12].

The purpose of the present article is to present alter-
native theoretical methods for the continuum spectra of
molecules. Our methods rely upon the linear response
theory in the time-dependent local-density approxima-
tion (TDLDA) and employ a uniform grid representation
in a three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate.

The TDLDA (or alternatively called the

time-
dependent density-functional theory) is an extension of

the static density-functional theory to describe electronic
dynamics under a time-dependent external ﬁeld [13]. In
the practical applications, an adiabatic approximation
is usually assumed: the same exchange-correlation po-
tential as that in the static case is used for the time-
dependent problem. The correlation eﬀect is included
through the dynamical screening which is represented
by an induced local potential. In the TDLDA, the con-
tinuum boundary condition was treated with the radial
Green’s function for spherical systems such as atoms [14]
and clusters in the spherical jellium model [15,16]. The
importance of the dynamical screening eﬀect on the con-
tinuum response has been stressed. The method has
been extended for molecules with a single-center expan-
sion technique [17]. However, the application was limited
to small, axially symmetric molecules.

Since the Hamiltonian in the Kohn-Sham theory is al-
most diagonal in coordinate representation, a grid rep-
resentation in the coordinate space provides an econom-
ical description. A uniform grid representation in the
three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate which has been
developed by Chelikowsky et.al [18] provides a conve-
nient basis for our purpose. The problem is then how
to incorporate the scattering boundary condition in the
uniform grid representation.

Our ﬁrst method is based on the real-time method
which one of the present authors has recently devel-
oped to calculate dynamic polarizability of ﬁnite systems
[19,20]. In the method, the time-dependent Kohn-Sham
equation is solved explicitly in real-time as well as in real-
space with a uniform grid. The dynamic polarizability of
a whole spectral region is then obtained at once through
the time-frequency Fourier transformation. An advan-
tage of this method is that we do not need to handle

matrices of very large dimensionality, since only a single
Slater determinant is evolved in time. A drawback is that
the single-particle continuum states cannot be treated ex-
actly because the electrons are conﬁned in a limited size
of box (model space). A possible way to avoid the diﬃ-
culty would be employing a complex absorbing potential
at the end of the box, which we shall discuss later.

Our second method is based on the modiﬁed Stern-
heimer method [21]. The method has been widely used
in the linear response calculations [22,23]. It recasts the
response problem into solving the static Schr¨odinger-type
equation with a source term. The problem is then to solve
the equation with an appropriate outgoing boundary con-
dition. Our recipe here is to solve iteratively the equa-
tion taking into account the boundary condition employ-
ing a Green’s function of a spherical potential, separating
the self-consistent potential into long range spherical and
short range non-spherical parts.

The paper is organized as follows. We present our
methods in Sec.
II. The real-time method with an
absorptive boundary potential and the Green’s function
method are explained.
In Sec. III, applications of the
methods will be demonstrated. First the spherical jel-
lium cluster is considered to conﬁrm reliability of our
methods. We then show calculations of photoabsorption
spectra of some small molecules and compare them with
measurements. We give interpretation of the obtained
spectra. Finally conclusion are drawn in Sec. IV.

II. LINEAR RESPONSE IN THE CONTINUUM

OF THREE-DIMENSIONAL REAL SPACE

A. Real-time method with an absorbing potential

In this section we ﬁrst recapitulate the real-time
method in TDLDA [19,24]. For systems with relatively
large number of particles, the real-time method is one
of the most eﬃcient method to calculate the electronic
excitations in molecules and atomic clusters.

The TDLDA equations for a spin-independent N -
electron system are given in terms of the time-dependent
Hamiltonian h(t) which is a functional of the density
n(r, t).

conserving pseudopotential [25] with a separable approx-
imation [26]. µxc is an exchange-correlation potential.

We represent the electronic wave function on a uni-
form grid points inside a certain spatial area [18]. All
potentials in Eq. (2.2) are diagonal in this representation
except for the nonlocal part of Vion. The second order dif-
ferential operator in the kinetic energy is approximated
employing a nine-point formula. For the time evolution,
we use an algorithm developed in Ref. [27] which utilize a
predictor-corrector method. The integration of Eq. (2.1)
is approximately carried out with a fourth-order Taylor
expansion.:

φi(t + ∆t) = e−ih(t+∆t/2)∆tφi(t)

4

Xn=0

≈

(−ih(t + ∆t/2)∆t)n

n!

φi(t).

(2.4)

For stable iteration, the time step ∆t should be smaller
than the inverse of the maximum eigenvalue of the Hamil-
tonian. The energy and the particle-number conserva-
tions are then well satisﬁed. This method was successful
in nuclear physics to investigate the dynamics of nuclear
reaction [27,28] and has been proved to be fruitful for
electron systems as well [19,24].

We start with the static LDA problem solving the
ground-state Kohn-Sham equations and determine the
initial occupied orbitals φi(r) and density n0(r). The
conjugate gradient method is used to solve the static
Kohn-Sham equation. Then, an external ﬁeld is turned
on instantaneously at t = 0. In this paper, we shall con-
sider only the dipole response, adopting Vext = k0rνδ(t)
(ν = x, y, z) which produces an initial state for the time
evolution as

φi(r, 0+) = e−ik0rν φi(r),

ν = x, y, z.

(2.5)

We calculate time evolution with this initial condition
without any external ﬁelds. The dynamical polarizabili-
ties in the time representation is then obtained as

αν (t) = −

e2

k0 Z d3rrν δn(r, t),

ν = x, y, z,

(2.6)

where the transition density is simply given by the dif-
ference from that of the ground-state

i = 1,··· , N/2

(2.1)

δn(r, t) = n(r, t) − n0(r).

(2.7)

+ µxc[n(r, t)],

Since the dynamical polarizability is usually deﬁned in
the energy representation, we take the Fourier transform
of Eq. (2.6).

to obtain α(ω) in energy resolution of Γ, we need to cal-
culate the time evolution up to T ≥ 2π/Γ. In the next

We adopt ¯h = 1 throughout the present paper. Vion is
an electron-ion potential for which we employ a norm-

direction, as

α(ω) = 1/3 Xν=x,y,z

αν(ω).

(2.9)

When the energy is in a region where ω + ǫi > 0, a
part of the electron wave functions φi(r, t) can escape to
the continuum. This outgoing part of wave function is
eventually reﬂected at the edge of the box and produces a
spurious discrete structure in the photoabsorption spec-
tra. Therefore, we now introduce an imaginary absorb-
ing potential W (r) to suppress the reﬂection and mimic
the continuum. Since the imaginary potential should be
zero in a region where the ground-state density has a
ﬁnite value, we should adopt a spherical box of large ra-
dius and the imaginary potential is switched on only in a
outer shell of width ∆r. Although the complex potential
at the edge of the box slightly violates normalization and
energy conservation, the box must be large enough to
preserve the conservations if the time evolution is carried
out using an initial state of Eq. (2.5) with k0 = 0 (the
ground state).

We adopt an absorptive potential of a linear depen-
dence on coordinate, which has been discussed in the
wave-packet method for molecular collisions [29,30]:

W (r) = (cid:26) 0

−iW0

r−R
∆r

for 0 < r < R,
for R < r < R + ∆r.

(2.10)

The height W0 and width ∆r must be carefully chosen
to prevent the reﬂection. There has been an argument
based on the WKB theory to elucidate a condition of no
reﬂection [29,30].

For simplicity, let us take a one-dimensional system.
The absorbing potential is given by a form similar to Eq.
(2.10): W (x) = 0 for x < 0 and W (x) = −iW0x/∆x for
x > 0. The WKB solution is

If we demand |R|2 < 0.001 and |ψ(∆x)|2 < 0.01, we have

E1/2

10

∆r√8mE3/2,

(2.15)

where ∆x has been replaced by ∆r. This is the condi-
tion discussed in Ref. [30] which we shall test with nu-
merical calculations. Strictly speaking, the conditions,
|R|2 < 0.001 and |ψ(∆x)|2 < 0.01, lead to a factor 18.4
instead of 20 in the left hand side and 0.128 instead of
1/10 in the right hand side. In actual real-time calcula-
tions, electrons with diﬀerent energies are emitted simul-
taneously. Thus, ∆r and W0 must be chosen properly ac-
cording to the energy spectrum of photoabsorption above
the ionization threshold.

B. Green’s function method with an outgoing

boundary condition

Exact treatment of the continuum is possible with the
use of a Green’s function. For spherical systems, the
Green’s function can easily be constructed by making
a multipole expansion and discretizing the radial coor-
dinate. The method was ﬁrst applied to nuclear giant
resonances [31,32] and then applied to photoabsorption
in atoms [33,14]. In this section we present a method to
construct a Green’s function in the uniform grid repre-
sentation for a system without any spatial symmetry.

The linear response theory is formulated most conve-
niently using a density-density correlation function [34].
The general formalism with local-density approximation
is given in the frequency representation [32,14]. The tran-
sition density, which corresponds to the Fourier trans-
form of Eq. (2.7), can be expressed with the use of the
independent-particle density-density correlation function

Conditions we require are |R|2 ≪ 1 (no reﬂection) and
|ψ(∆x)| ≪ 1 (complete absorption). A continuity condi-
tion for a derivative at x = 0 leads to

where Vscf is the self-consistent ﬁeld which is the sum of
the external ﬁeld and the dynamical screening (dielectric)
ﬁeld:

δn(r

(2.17)

where V [n(r)] is a single-particle potential of the time-
independent version of Eq. (2.2), deﬁned by h =
−∇2/2m + V . Although a part of V is non-local, the
screening ﬁeld arises from density-dependent parts of V ,
the direct Coulomb and the exchange-correlation poten-
tials, which are local. The calculation neglecting the sec-
ond term of Eq. (2.17) will be called an ”independent-
particle approximation” (IPA) in the next section.

discrete and continuum states. Instead of taking the ex-
plicit summation, we may use the single-particle Green’s

(2.19)

The sign determines a boundary condition of the Green’s
function; the (+) for a outgoing wave and the (−) for an
incoming wave. In fact, the summation with respect to m
in Eq. (2.18) can be extended to all states because the
summation over the occupied states for the ﬁrst term
will be canceled by a contribution from the second term.
Therefore, using Eq. (2.19), we can rewrite (2.18) as

′),

(2.20)

where we assume that the occupied states have real wave
functions.

To calculate the dipole photoresponse of a system, one
should take Vext = rν, ν = x, y, z. Then, the dynamic
polarizability is given by

αν (ω) = −e2Z d3rrν δn(r, ω),

ν = x, y, z.

(2.21)

Since the number of spatial grid points is large, it is
not convenient and even impossible to construct explic-
itly the response function χ0(r, r′; ω) and to perform spa-
tial integration by summing up over grid points in solving
the self-consistent equations, Eqs. (2.16) and (2.17). We
can avoid the diﬃculty by converting the integral into the
equivalent diﬀerential equation. We introduce a function

ψi(r; E, Vscf ) ≡ Z d3r′G(+)(r, r

′; E)Vscf (r

′)φi(r

′). (2.22)

The transition density is then expressed as

δn(r, ω) = 2

Xi

φi(r)(cid:8)(ψi(r; (ǫi − ω)∗, V ∗

(2.23)

is equivalent to the Schr¨odinger equation of energy E =
ǫi ± ω with a source term,

(E − h[n0])|ψii = Vscf|φii,

(2.24)

assuming that the function hr|ψii outside a box area van-
ishes. The integral in Eq. (2.22) is thus converted into a
linear algebraic equation (2.24). This procedure is known
as the modiﬁed Sternheimer method [21]. However, since
this cannot describe a correct asymptotic behavior of the
wave function, it is not applicable when the energy E is
close to zero. Furthermore, when E > 0, the method is
incapable to produce the continuum spectra.

Thus, the remaining task is to calculate ψi(r; E, Vscf )
deﬁned by Eq. (2.22) under an appropriate outgoing
boundary condition. For this purpose, we employ an
integral equation for the Green’s function. We start
with a single-particle problem with a spherical poten-
tial V0(r). For instance, the Green’s function for free
particles (V0(r) = 0) has an analytic expression,

where k = √2mE (E > 0). For a negative energy E < 0,
exp(+ik|r−r′|) in Eq. (2.25) is replaced by exp(−κ|r−r′|)
with κ = √−2mE. The single-particle Green’s function
for a non-spherical (even non-local) potential V (r, r′)
then satisﬁes the following integral equation

ary condition of G(+)

of G(+). Substituting this into Eq. (2.22), we obtain a
multi-linear equations for ψi(r; E, Vscf ),

In the discretization, this is a linear algebraic equation
for grid points inside the box area. However, the solu-
tion outside the box area is needed to apply the Lapla-
cian operator and should be prepared by other method.
We prepare it by a multipole expansion method. Noting
that V0(r) is a central potential, G(+)
can be expressed
in terms of the regular and irregular solutions of radial
Schr¨odinger equation in the usual way.

We must choose the V0(r) so as to make the poten-
tial ˜V (r) = V (r) − V0(r) be negligible outside the box.
For neutral molecules, the attractive ionic potential is ap-
proximately canceled out by the repulsive direct Coulomb
term. However we will later employ a gradient-corrected
exchange potential which possesses a correct asymptotic
form of −e2/r. Therefore we use a jellium potential,
Eq. (3.1), with Z = 1 as V0(r). The w(+)
(r; E) in Eq.
(2.30) is an irregular Coulomb wave function with an
outgoing boundary condition. We use a FORTRAN77
program “COULCC” in Ref. [35] to calculate Coulomb
functions of complex energies. The ul(r, E) in Eq. (2.31)
is calculated by integrating the radial Schr¨odinger equa-
tion with a fourth-order Runge-Kutta method.

We now summarize our procedure to solve the response
equation. Once an external ﬁeld Vext(r, ω) is given, Equa-
tions (2.16) and (2.17) constitute a linear equation for
the transition density δn(r, ω). Discretizing on a uni-
form grid, we have a linear algebraic equation with di-
mensionality equal to the number of grid points. In or-
der to solve the equation, we need to calculate actions
of the χ0 on some functions, which is equivalent to cal-
culate actions of the G(+). ψi(r; E, Vscf ) is calculated by
solving another linear equation (2.27). In order to solve
(2.27), we need to calculate actions of the G(+)
Eq.
.
This operation is achieved by solving Eq. (2.29), again
discretizing on grid points. We note that the outgoing
boundary condition is imposed at this stage. The wave
function Ψ(r; E) outside the box is prepared by a multi-
pole expansion method, Eqs. (2.30) and (2.31). Solutions
of linear equations (2.16), (2.27) and (2.29) are obtained
by iterative methods. The iterative procedure is summa-
rized in Fig. 1.

(2.29) is a hermitian problem. Therefore, the CG method
is very powerful to solve the equation. However, if the
energy is complex, Eq. (2.29) becomes a non-hermitian
problem to which the CG method is not applicable. For
such cases, we adopt a Bi-conjugate gradient (Bi-CG)
method. To solve Eq. (2.27), we have tested diﬀerent iter-
ative methods to this non-hermitian problem. We found
that a generalized conjugate residual (GCR) method is
one of the most eﬀective algorithms for the present prob-
lem. For the outer most iteration loop of Eq. (2.23), we
use the GCR method again.

where Ze is a total charge of a jellium sphere. For the
Na−
7 , we have Z = 7 and eight valence electrons. The
main photoabsorption peak is calculated to be above the
ionization threshold. Thus, this would be a good test
case to study a response in the continuum and to check
the applicability of the theories in the previous section.
We discretize three-dimensional Cartesian coordinates
with spacing ∆x = ∆y = ∆z = 1.5 ˚A and employ grid

points inside a spherical box of radius R = 12 ˚A. This
is found enough for the ground-state density to be negli-
gible at the edge r = R. The number of mesh points is
2109. The TDLDA Hamiltonian is given by Eq. (2.2)
in which the exchange-correlation potential is that of
Ref. [36]:

use the same technique as that of Ref. [32,14] (a Fortran

for E > e2/R and exp(−κr) with κ2 = 2m(e2/R − E)
for E < e2/R. Of course, this cause a change of the
threshold energy by e2/R, but it is enough to check va-
lidity of our methodology. We also add a small imaginary
parameter Γ/2 to the frequency ω, which plays exactly
the same role as a smoothing parameter of the Fourier
transform in real-time method, Eq. (2.8). In this calcu-
lation, Γ = 0.1 eV is used and the mesh size for radial
coordinate is as small as 0.1 ˚A.

For the three-dimensional Green’s function calculation,
in order to justify Eq. (2.26), a condition that ˜V (r) ≈ 0
for r > R must be satisﬁed. We assume that the asymp-
totic behavior is the same as that of the (radial) one-
dimensional calculation. Namely, we adopt the Green’s
function of free particles, Eq. (2.25), with an energy be-
ing shifted as E → E − e2/R. We also use the same
smoothing parameter Γ = 0.1 eV. It turns out that the
inclusion of Γ helps convergence of iterative procedure.

We show the results in Fig. 2. The three-dimensional
calculation has been done for a frequency range 0 < ω <
5 eV with a step ∆ω = 0.1 eV. The solid lines are the re-
sults of one-dimensional calculation in which the Green’s
functions are expanded in the partial wave, Eq. (3.3).
The squares are the results of the three-dimensional cal-
culation which perfectly agree with the solid lines. This
means that the Green’s function method on the three-
dimensional mesh is able to take account properly of the
continuum eﬀects.

The static calculation indicates the highest occupied
molecular orbital (HOMO) −0.37 eV, and a Coulomb
potential has a value e2/R = 1.2 eV at the edge of the
box R = 12 ˚A. Thus, the ionization threshold is 1.57 eV
in this calculation. The ﬁgure indicates that the pho-
toabsorption has peaks below and above the threshold.
In the IPA calculation, we obtain a single peak at an en-
ergy 1.4 eV. The screening potential brings the peak into
the continuum region (around 2.35 eV) and splits the sin-
gle peak into two parts at the threshold. The summed
oscillator strengths for energies up to 5 eV correspond to
about 95% of the Thomas-Kuhn-Reiche (TRK) sum rule
for valence electrons.

We now turn to the real-time method. A necessary size
of space is much larger than that of the Green’s function
method because the absorbing potential is set up in a
outer region R < r < R + ∆r. We prepare three kinds
of absorbing potentials in a linear form of Eq. (2.10): (a)
∆r = 6 ˚A with W0 = 2 eV, (b) ∆r = 12 ˚A with W0 = 1
eV and (c) ∆r = 21 ˚A with W0 = 1 eV. Using a square
mesh of ∆x = ∆y = ∆z = 1.5 ˚A, the numbers of mesh
points are (a) 7153, (b) 17077, and (c) 44473, respec-
tively. We use a duration of time evolution T = 70 eV−1
with a time step ∆t = 0.01 eV−1 and a smoothing param-
eter Γ = 0.1 eV for the Fourier transform. Since we have
a complex potential at the edge of the box, the energy
is not strictly conserved but the scale of violation turns
out to be less than 0.1% for this calculation. The imag-
inary part of dynamic polarizability is shown in Fig. 3.
Parts (a), (b) and (c) correspond to the three cases de-
scribed above. For (a) and (b), the main resonance in
the continuum region looks like a superposition of three
diﬀerent peaks which are located at ω ≈ 2, 2.7 and 3.5
eV, respectively. However, since we cannot see the same
behavior in Fig. 2 (a), this should be a spurious eﬀect of
the reﬂection of outgoing waves. This is conﬁrmed by a
calculation of (c), for which the structure at ω > 2.5 eV
is almost disappeared and we see only a smooth tail.

Now let us check the criterion of a good absorber, Eq.
(2.15). The position of the main peak is calculated at
Eres − Ethr = 2.35 − 1.57 ≈ 0.8 eV above the ionization
threshold. Using E=0.8 eV and (8m)−1 ≈ 1 eV ˚A2 for
electrons, Eq. (2.15) reduces to

18(∆r)−1 < |W0| < 0.07∆r,

(3.4)

where W0 in units of eV and ∆r in ˚A. This criterion is
satisﬁed for the case (c) but not for (a) and (b). Fig. 3
shows that the real-time method provides us with a cor-
rect response in the continuum if no reﬂection occurs at
the edge of the box. In order to ﬁnd a suitable absorb-
ing potential (of a linear form), we ﬁnd the criterion,
Eq. (2.15), very useful even when a condition W0/E ≪ 1
is not satisﬁed.

B. Valence shell photoabsorption of silane

of the highest occupied orbital also approximately coin-
cides with the ionization potential. For small molecules,
TDLDA calculations with this gradient correction have
shown to give accurate description of discrete excitations
in small molecules [38].

In the following sections III B, III C and III D, we em-
ploy a sum of the exchange-correlation potentials of µ(PZ)
of Ref. [39] for the local-density part and µ(LB) for the
gradient correction. We should remark here that an ac-
curate calculation of the gradient correction µ(LB)(r) be-
comes diﬃcult at far outside the molecule, because the
µ(LB) depends on |∇n(r)|/n(r)4/3 which approaches to
ﬁnite but both the numerator and the denominator ap-
proaches to zero at r → ∞. Thus, we use an explicit
asymptotic form, µ(LB)(r) = −e2/r for r > Rc. In the
followings, the Rc is chosen as 6.5 ˚A for silane and 5.5 ˚A
for acetylene and ethylene.

When we evaluate the screening ﬁeld in Eq.

(2.17),
we neglect the functional derivative of µ(LB)(r) with re-
spect to the density because this should be a small cor-
rection. For the real-time calculation, we make the same
approximation. Namely the time-dependent exchange-
correlation potential is calculated by

In this section, we discuss the application of our tech-
niques to a deformed molecule, silane SiH4. We use the
pseudopotentials which are calculated by the prescrip-
tions of Refs. [25,26]. For Si atom, we employ pseu-
dopotentials for s, p, d waves and take d-wave poten-
tial as a local part. For the hydrogen atom, we take
s and p potentials with the latter as a local potential.
The box is a sphere of radius R = 7 ˚A discretized in
meshes of ∆x = ∆y = ∆z = 0.4 ˚A. Position of the Si
atom (nucleus) is located at the origin and four hydro-
gen atoms are at (1.209, 0.0, 0.855), (−1.209, 0.0, 0.855),
(0.0, 1.209,−0.855), and (0.0,−1.209,−0.855) in units of
˚A. The symmetry of this molecule belongs to the tetra-
hedral (Td) point group. The valence electronic orbitals
in the ground state are

It is well known that the energy of the highest occupied
orbital does not coincide with the ﬁrst ionization poten-
tial in the simplest local-density approximation. This
fact causes a serious problem for the continuum response
calculation that the ionization threshold cannot be ade-
quately described by the static Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian.
Furthermore, the excited states around the ionization
threshold appear in too low excitation energies. To rem-
edy this defect, a gradient correction for the exchange-
correlation potential has been proposed. We utilize the
one constructed by van Leeuven and Baerends [37] which
we denote as µ(LB). It is so constructed that the poten-
tial has a correct −e2/r tail asymptotically. The energy

In actual calculations, we do not assume a priori the sym-
metry, but the degeneracies of electron orbitals according
to Eq. (III B) naturally emerge after the minimization of
the total energy. For this molecule, the dipole response
does not depend on the direction of an external ﬁeld. A
smoothing parameter Γ = 0.5 eV is used in the follow-
ings.

Utilizing the exchange-correlation potential of µ(PZ) +
µ(LB), the calculated occupied valence orbitals in the
ground state are listed in Table I. If we neglect the gra-
dient correction term µ(LB), we obtain −13.5 eV for 3a1

7

and −8.3 eV for 2t2, respectively. The photoabsorption
oscillator strengths for silane calculated by means of the
Green’s function method are shown in Fig. 4. The oscil-
lator strength df /dω, the photoabsorption cross section
σ(ω), and the imaginary part of dynamic polarizability
Imα(ω), are related to each other by

A sharp peak at 10 eV in the calculation consists of
bound discrete peaks overlapped by the width Γ. In the
experiment [43,44,1], we observe a peak at 10.7 eV, the
width of which is considered to originate from a cou-
pling of electronic excitation with ionic motion. Since we
ﬁx the ion coordinates and calculate vertical electronic
excitations, we cannot describe the width below the ion-
ization threshold.

On the other hand, a broad peak at 14.6 eV in the ex-
periment is above the ionization threshold and the main
decay channel is an emission of the electron [43,1]. The
calculation well reproduces this peak although the energy
shifts slightly to the lower (14 eV). Beyond the peak of
14.6 eV, a group of tiny peaks is observed in the exper-
iment, which is assigned the Rydberg states with a hole
(3a1)−1 embedded in the continuum. This ﬁne structure
is smeared out in the calculation because the smoothing
parameter Γ is much larger than the width of each Ryd-
berg state. The integrated oscillator strengths for ener-
gies up to 30 eV is calculated to exhaust 87% of the TRK
sum rule for valence electrons. About 60% of the valence
shell strengths lie between 10 and 20 eV (Fig. 5 (b)).

FIG. 4. Calculated and experimental photoabsorption
oscillator strengths of silane. The thick solid line is the
calculation compared with synchrotron radiation experi-
ment (thin solid line) [43] and high resolution dipole (e,e)
experiment (dotted line) [44]. The dashed line is the IPA
calculation without dynamical screening. The smoothing
parameter Γ = 0.5 eV is used in the calculation. Inset:
An energy region of 13 < ω < 15 eV is magniﬁed and
the total oscillator strengths are decomposed into those
associated with diﬀerent occupied valence electrons, 3a1
(solid line) and 2t2 (dashed line).

The screening ﬁeld in Eq. (2.17) signiﬁcantly reduces
a dipole polarizability at low frequency. The calculated
static dipole polarizability is 5.1 ˚A3 while it is 7.9 ˚A3 in
the IPA. The dielectric eﬀects also change the absorption
spectra. The screening shifts the resonance energies to
higher energies because the electron-electron correlation
is repulsive. Roughly speaking, the IPA overestimates
the absorption spectra at low frequency and underesti-
mates at high frequency. As you see in Fig. 4, the di-
electric eﬀects are very important to reproduce the mag-
nitude and shape of the photoresponse.

In order to discuss details of each resonance, it is useful
to calculate a partial oscillator strength of each occupied
orbital which should be identiﬁed with a photoemission
spectra if the neutral dissociation channel without elec-
tron emission is negligibly small. As we see in Ref. [14],
the photoabsorption cross section can be written as a
sum of contributions from all occupied orbitals. Here we

Below the ionization threshold, there are three bound
transitions in our calculations which we ﬁnd are associ-
ated with the excitations of 2t2 valence electrons. The
ﬁrst two transitions are considered to correspond to the
shoulders in the measurements [44,45] and interpreted as
transitions to the Rydberg states. The broad resonance
at 14 eV (14.6 eV in experiment) is above the ioniza-
tion threshold of the 2t2 orbitals. Therefore, the struc-
ture may be more complex. An inset of Fig. 4 shows
the partial oscillator strengths of 3a1 and 2t2 orbitals
in a photon-energy region of 13 to 15 eV. The calcula-
tion suggests that the resonance structure is due to the
bound-to-bound excitation of 3a1 electrons. The exci-
tation couples with the bound-to-continuum excitations
of 2t2 electrons through the dynamical screening eﬀect.
The coupling shifts the excitation energy up by about 1
eV and brings about the width due to the autoionization
process. The partial cross section of 2t2 electrons also
acquires oscillation as a function of the excitation energy
due to the rapid change of the induced ﬁeld.

Now let us examine the applicability of the real-time
method. The time step is chosen as ∆t = 0.002 eV−1
and the time evolution is calculated up to T = 12 eV−1.
We show the results in Fig. 5 (a). The bound excited
states is reasonably described in the calculation. On the
other hand, the calculation without an absorbing poten-
tial (thin line) apparently provides a wrong response in
the continuum region. We must adopt an imaginary po-
tential to remove several spurious resonances. However,
it is very diﬃcult to treat the ionization energy properly.
In order to mimic the continuum, the absorber should
be eﬀective only for a outgoing electron with positive en-
ergy. The problem is that the static potential has −e2/r
behavior at large r. Electrons with negative energies
(−e2/R < E < 0) may be absorbed by the imaginary
potential. Therefore, the eﬀective ionization potential
becomes −ǫHOMO − e2/R for this calculation. Taking
R = 7 ˚A, this shift in the ionization potential amounts
to about 2 eV. The calculated peak in the continuum is
located at ω = 14 eV. According to the condition (2.15)
with E = 14−12.4+2 = 3.6 eV, we adopt the ∆r = 10 ˚A
and W0 = 4 eV. The number of grid points is 321,781 for

this case. The thick line in Fig. 5 (a) shows the result.
The spurious peaks disappear and the result well agrees
with that of the Green’s function method. The oscillator
strengths near the ionization threshold (11 < ω < 13 eV)
indicate some discrepancies, which we naturally expect
from the above argument. In Fig. 5 (b), integrated os-
cillator strength is plotted against the energy. Seven out
of eight (TRK sum rule) unit of strength locates below
30 eV.

Finally we should mention the feasibility of computa-
tion. In order to calculate the absorption spectra of Fig.
5, the real-time method takes about 10 hours using a
single CPU of a Fujitsu VPP700E. On the other hand,
the Green’s function method takes about 30 minutes for
each energy. Thus, the real-time method is faster than
the Green’s function method if the response is calculated
for over 20 diﬀerent energies. We have carried out the cal-
culations for 125 frequencies to obtain the smooth line of
Fig. 4.

C. Valence shell photoabsorption of acetylene

The acetylene molecule, C2H2, has a symmetry conﬁg-
uration of D∞h. This high symmetry has made possible a
calculation of the Green’s function using a single-center
expansion [17]. Even so, only two kinds of molecular
orbitals, 3σg and 1πu, which are primarily derived from
atomic p states have been taken into account in Ref. [17],
because it was diﬃcult to describe the s-derived states in
the single-center formulation. In the present paper, we
consider all valence orbitals, including the 2σg and 2σu
in addition to the above p-derived orbitals, to calculate
the photoresponses.

The spherical box is taken as R = 6 ˚A with meshes of
∆x = ∆y = ∆z = 0.3 ˚A. All atoms are located on the
z-axis at ±0.601 ˚A for carbon and ±1.663 ˚A for hydro-
gen. There are ten valence electrons and the calculated
energies of occupied orbitals are listed in Table I. Using
the Green’s function method, we obtain the photoabsorp-
tion oscillator strengths as a function of photon energy,
shown in Fig. 6. The calculation indicates a sharp bound

9

resonance at ω = 9.6 eV and a broad structure around
15 eV which seems to be a superposition of three reso-
nances. The resonance at 9.6 eV strongly responds to
a dipole ﬁeld parallel to the molecular axis. The large
oscillator strengths in the IPA at ω = 5 ∼ 8 eV and at
ω = 12.5 ∼ 13.5 eV are shifted to higher energies by
the dielectric eﬀects. The agreements with the experi-
mental data are signiﬁcantly improved by the inclusion
of the dynamical screening. The static dipole polarizabil-
ity is also aﬀected signiﬁcantly: In the IPA calculation,
the polarizabilities parallel (αk) and perpendicular (α⊥)
to the molecular axis are αk = 10.7 ˚A3 and α⊥ = 3.87
˚A3. The dynamic screening reduces these values to 4.79
˚A3 and 2.77 ˚A3, respectively, which well agree with the
experimental values, αk = 4.73 and α⊥ = 2.87 ˚A3 [47].

We ﬁnd some disagreements between the calculation
and the experiment in Fig. 6. We observe two distinct
peaks in the experiments for the broad resonance around
15 eV. However, the calculation indicates three peaks.
The lowest (13.2 eV) and the highest ones (15.9 eV) are
related with responses to a dipole ﬁeld parallel to the
molecular axis, while the middle one (14.3 eV) is a re-
sponse to the perpendicular ﬁeld. We plot the partial os-
cillator strengths in an inset of Fig. 6. The lowest peak at
13.2 eV consists of the transition of 3σg valence orbitals.
The middle peak at 14.3 eV turns out to consist of contri-
butions of 2σu and 1πu orbitals. We need an energy shift
of these strengths by about 1 eV to reproduce the experi-
ments. An accurate conﬁguration interaction calculation
with the Schwinger variational method is available for
this molecule [48]. This calculation succeeds to reproduce
the double peak structure. The assignments are consis-
tent to ours: 3σg for lower and 2σu for higher transitions.

acetylene calculated with the real-time method. The thin
line corresponds to the result obtained with the box of
R = 10 ˚A without a complex absorbing potential, while
the thick line to the one with a complex potential of
W0 = 4 eV and ∆r = 10 ˚A in addition to a spherical
box of R = 6 ˚A. In carrying out the Fourier transform,
the smoothing parameter Γ = 0.5 eV is used. (b) The
integrated oscillator strength f (ω). The TRK sum rule
indicates f (∞) = 10 for the valence shell photoabsorp-
tion.

The experiments also indicate discrete Rydberg series
around 10 eV. We do not see this structure in the cal-
culation because we have used a smoothing parameter
Γ = 0.5 eV which is much larger than the experimental
energy resolution.
In principle, we can calculate these
Rydberg states since the potential has a −e2/r behavior
In order to obtain these ﬁne struc-
at large distance.
tures, we have to calculate the response with Γ ≈ 0 and
the small frequency mesh ∆ω (order of meV) must be
adopted. This is beyond a scope of this paper.

The real-time calculation is carried out with the same
imaginary potential as we have used for silane (W0 = 4
eV and ∆r = 10 ˚A). We have 635,371 grid points in this
space. The time evolution is calculated up to T = 12
eV−1 with a time step of ∆t = 0.001 eV−1. The results
are shown in Fig. 7 (a). Again the absorbing potential
is an essential ingredient to obtain sensible results in the
continuum energy region. The calculated photoabsorp-
tion spectra well agree with those of the Green’s function
calculation except for minor oscillatory behaviors at high
energy. This spurious oscillations start to appear at an
energy ω ≈ 22 eV. In fact, the condition of a good ab-
sorber, Eq. (2.15), is not satisﬁed in this energy region.
Namely the potential (W0 = 4 eV) is too week to absorb
such high energy particles. In Fig. 7 (b), we show the
integrated oscillator strengths up to 40 eV. One-fourth of
the TRK sum rule value of valence electrons is in an en-
ergy region over 40 eV. It is worth noting that the CPU
time of the real-time calculation is less than one-ﬁfth of
that of the Green’s function calculation.

D. Valence shell photoabsorption of ethylene

The ethylene C2H4 is the simplest organic π-system,
which possesses the D2h symmetry. The two carbon
atoms are on the x-axis at x = ±0.6695 ˚A and four
hydrogen atoms are in the x − y plane at (x, y) =
(1.2342, 0.9288),
(−1.2342, 0.9288),
(−1.2342,−0.9288) in units of ˚A. There are twelve va-
lence electrons, and calculated eigenenergies of occupied
valence orbitals are listed in Table I.

(1.2342,−0.9288),

The calculations are carried out using the same box
(R = 6 ˚A) and mesh size (0.3 ˚A) as we have used for
the acetylene molecule. The photoabsorption oscillator
strengths calculated with the Green’s function method
are shown in Fig. 8. The agreement with an experiment
[49] is excellent. Almost all the main features of pho-
toabsorption spectra are reproduced in the calculation.
The observed bound excited states show diﬀerent pho-
toresponses according to the direction of the dipole ﬁeld.
The lowest peak at ω = 7.6 eV is mainly a response to a
dipole ﬁeld parallel to the molecular (C−C) axis. This is
associated with the excitations of the HOMO 1b3u elec-
trons. On the other hand, states at 9.8 eV respond almost
equally to a dipole ﬁeld of x, y, and z direction, to which
both 1b3g and 1b3u occupied orbitals contribute. A small
peak at ω = 11.4 eV is calculated as a resonance of 3ag
orbital, which may correspond to a small shoulder in the
experiment. Beyond 11.7 eV, the HOMO electrons are
in the continuum. The ﬁrst prominent peak at 12.4 eV
is a resonance with respect to a dipole ﬁeld of y direction
which is in the molecular plane and perpendicular to the
C−C bond. The excitations of the 1b2u and 1b3g elec-
trons are main components of this resonance. In a region
of 13.2 < ω < 20 eV, the 1b3g electrons can be excited
into the continuum and produce the smooth background
of oscillator strengths (0.1 ∼ 0.2 eV−1). A peak struc-
ture at 14.6 eV is made of the excitation of 1b2u electrons.
The peak at 16.4 eV is constructed by excitations from
the 2b1u occupied orbitals, while the experiment indicates
the resonance at 17.1 eV.

The above analysis is consistent with that in the liter-
ature [49], except for the 12.4 eV peak (11.9 eV in the
experiment). Our analysis suggests transition of 1b3g and
1b2u electrons while Ref. [49] indicates 3ag.

Comparing the TDLDA calculation with that of the
IPA (dashed line), we see again that the dynamic screen-
ing eﬀect is very important to reproduce the experimental
data. This feature of the IPA result is consistent with the
other calculations without the dynamic screening [50].
The calculated dipole polarizability is α = 4.22 ˚A3 (5.47,
3.97, 3.23 ˚A3 for x, y, z direction, respectively), which
is in a good agreement with the experimental value, 4.22
˚A3 [47]. In the IPA calculation, we obtain α = 7.04 ˚A3
(10.4, 5.96, 4.76).

Results of the real-time calculation are shown in Fig.
9 (a). The box and imaginary potential we use are the
same as those for acetylene. We can obtain a sensible re-

sult if we adopt the absorbing potential. However, again,
a spurious oscillatory behavior is seen at high energy re-
gion because the absorbing potential is not strong enough
to erase those high-energy components.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

We have developed methods based on the TDLDA of
investigating the photoresponses in the continuum for
systems with no spatial symmetry:
(1) The real-time
method with an absorbing potential, and (2) the Green’s
function method. These methods allow us to treat the
photoionization and the dynamical screening eﬀects self-
consistently. For the real-time method, we have tested

11

imaginary potentials of diﬀerent kinds and found that
those satisfying a condition, Eq.
(2.15), are good to
mimic the continuum eﬀect. However, it is very diﬃ-
cult to treat the photoabsorption spectra in vicinity of
the ionization threshold. There are two reasons: One
is because the condition, Eq.
(2.15), requires a large
model space to treat such a low-energy emission prop-
erly. The second is that the ionization threshold is not
correct when the potential has a 1/r behavior at large dis-
tance. In addition to this, since the condition is energy
dependent, it is very diﬃcult to construct a good ab-
sorber for low-energy and high-energy outgoing electrons
simultaneously. The advantage of the real-time method is
a computational feasibility. Utilizing the Fourier trans-
form, we can obtain the spectra over the whole energy
region at once.

The Green’s function method possesses a capability of
an exact treatment of the continuum. Using a Green’s
function of Coulomb asymptotic waves, it is also possi-
ble to investigate the photoresponse near the threshold.
The main diﬃculty of the Green’s function treatment is
a heavy computational task. In order to reduce the CPU
time, we use a complex energy for the Green’s function,
G(ω + iΓ/2). We have found that the inclusion of the
imaginary part Γ facilitates a convergence of iterative
procedures in the calculation. The Γ also plays a role of
lowering an energy resolution of the calculations. Thus,
we can choose a value of Γ depending on the energy res-
olution required in each problem. We would like to em-
phasize again that the method is capable of calculating
response functions of many-electron systems, below, near
and above the ionization threshold in a uniﬁed manner.

The numerical calculations have been performed for
a spherical Na−
7 cluster (test study) and non-spherical
molecules, SiH4, C2H2, and C2H4.
Studies of pho-
toresponse for deformed molecules including both the
dynamic screening and the continuum eﬀect are very
few. An exception is a study of nitrogen and acetylene
molecules (with a high symmetry D∞h) by Levine and
Soven [17] using the single-center expansion technique.
However, only 1πu and 3σg occupied orbitals are included
in their calculation because of limitation of the single-
center expansion. Since our calculation has been carried
out on three-dimensional coordinate meshes, we do not
need any spatial symmetry including all valence orbitals
in the calculation. We present the photoabsorption os-
cillator strengths compared with dipole (e, e) and syn-
chrotron radiation experiments. The agreement is gen-
erally excellent. The inclusion of the dynamic screening
turns out to be essential to reproduce the experiments.
The IPA calculation overestimates the strengths at low
energy and underestimates at high energy.

We are strongly encouraged by the success of our meth-
ods applied to simple molecules in the present paper. The
applications to more complex systems may become pos-
sible in near future.

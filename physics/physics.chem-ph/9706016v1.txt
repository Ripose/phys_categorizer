Abstract

Some aspects of direct ion transfer across the water/1,2- dichloroethane

are analyzed using a very simple model based on thermodynamic con-
siderations. It was concluded that ion solvation by water molecules
may occur in some particular cases in the organic phase, delivering
an important contribution to the Gibbs free energy of ion transfer be-
tween the aqueous and the organic phase. In general terms, this par-
ticular type of transfer should be favored in the case of highly charged
small ions at interfaces with a relatively low surface tension and a
large diﬀerence between the reciprocal of the corresponding dielectric
constants.

1 Introduction

The understanding of charge transfer processes across liquid / liquid inter-
faces is particularly important in many areas of chemistry, physical chemistry
and biology. In the last decades a variety of electrochemical methods have
been adapted to study these processes. Cyclic voltammetry, chronopoten-
tiometry, impedance spectroscopy applied to macro and more recently to
microinterfaces between two immiscible liquids are currently being used [1]-
[5]. Nevertheless, interpretation of the experimental data requires in many
cases a proper knowledge of the interface [6][7]. In recent years new exper-
imental techniques have been developed, which allow to obtain molecular
level information concerning the interface. Second harmonic generation at
the liquid / liquid interface provides information about the state of molecules,
especially the surfactants adsorbed at the interface[8][9][10]. Scanning elec-
trochemical microscopy studies of charge transfer processes across ITIES are
in progress[11][12]. The concentration proﬁles on both sides of the phase
boundary can be probed and the thickness of the mixed solvent layer can
be evaluated by scanning the ultramicroelectrode tip[13]. More recently, IR
reﬂection spectroscopy[14] and specular reﬂection of neutrons [15] have been
applied yielding information at the molecular level. Theoretical calculations
should provide an important contribution to give insight into interfacial struc-
ture and the mechanism of transfer across ITIES; several authors have used
molecular dynamics to model the interface, the ion transfer[16][17] and the
water/oil interface in the presence of micelles[18] or in the presence of a mono-
layer of amphipatic molecules[19]. Benjamin [20] has employed equilibrium
free energy calculations and equilibrium dynamics trajectories to provide a
detailed microscopic picture of the ion transfer processes. He showed that
the transfer into the organic phase is accompanied by a hydration shell of
water molecules and may also involve ion-pairing. A lattice gas model has
been recently used by Pereira et al. [21]and Schmickler [22] to clarify a num-
ber of experimental features of liquid-liquid interfaces, including capacity
and ion transfer. On the other hand, continuum models have also been em-
ployed to understand ion transfer between immiscible liquids. A review on
this topic has been given by Markin and Volkov[23], where the Born model,
non-linear dielectric eﬀects and the use of non-local electrostatic methods
were analyzed. Although quantitatively poor, the Born theory was found to
provide a qualitative understanding of ion transfer processes from an aqueous

2

to an organic phase, concerning the eﬀect of static permittivity and ion size.
Among continuum models, it is also worth mentioning the contribution of
Abraham et al. in a sequence of papers[24][25][26][27][28], where calculations
of free energies and entropies of solvation were performed for a number of
systems. We shall refer to these papers as A&Ln, the number n denoting
the number with which each part was originally labelled.

It is the purpose of the present work to revive and shear new light on
one of the aspects considered in A&L5, which is that of ion hydration in
the organic phase. We add a new feature to their model that introduces an
extra term to the free energy of transfer which was previously ignored . This
accounts for the interaction between the water layer surrounding the ion in
the organic phase and the organic solvent. We also use the Born model to
discuss some qualitative features of the present formulation.

2 The model

We consider the direct transfer of alkaline and alkaline earth ions, indicating
this process as:

M +z(aq) ⇀↽ M +z(org)

(1)

As pointed out in A&L5[28] in their calculation of partition coeﬃcients,
the free energy of transfer ∆Gt of the ion from water to the organic solvent
contains in principle neutral and electrostatic terms. Since the former con-
tributes to ∆Gt only to a minor extent, we shall ignore it in most of the
discussion given below.

Table I shows the Standard Gibbs energy ∆G0

tr of this reaction as given
[29], compared with the corresponding values for several
by Sabela et al.
anions. In contrast to the transfer of anions, where large diﬀerences are ob-
served, the transfer energy for the smaller alkaline ions appears to be rather
size-insensitive. An interpretation of these results could be attempted in
terms of a continuum model of the solvent with inclusion of non linear di-
electric eﬀects or non local electrostatic models, as proposed in an interesting
review by Markin and Volkov[23]. However, we ﬁrst want to draw attention
here to an alternative model, which is also based on a continuum model for
the solvent, but introduces a feature that has been absent in most of the
previous theoretical considerations. This characteristic is the allowance for a

3

remaining solvation sheet belonging to the aqueous phase even after the ion
has been transferred to the organic phase. In fact, although Abraham and
Liszi [28] did consider the existence of a hydration sheet in the organic phase,
a relevant contribution to the free energy of transfer was omitted there, as
discussed below. At the very preliminary stage of development of these spec-
ulations, we will not seek a close agreement with the experiment, but rather
point out under which circumstances this kind of events may occur. More
sophisticated theoretical considerations and further experimental evidence
will allow the conﬁrmation or rebuttal of the present ideas.

We turn now to consider a naive but enlightening model for the trans-
fer of ions from the aqueous to the organic phase and we later considered
some improvements to it within the continuum approach. In order to avoid
confusion, we want to state here what we mean when we write below the
”radius of the ion”. In the case where we use ideas related to the work of
Abraham and Liszi, we shall be talking about the crystallographic radius.
On the other hand, when we apply the concept developed by Rashin and
Honig [31], we shall be actually referring to the cavity that the ion produces
into the solvent. A detailed discussion about this point has been given by
Rashin and Honig[31]. Our ﬁrst simpliﬁed model is shown in Figure 1 and
follows the ideas suggested in A&L5. We assume that the alkaline ion of
radius ro eventually may carry with it a solvation sheet of radius rs − ro, so
that after the transfer it is immersed in a mixed dielectric medium, consti-
tuted by a sphere of dielectric constant ε1, the same as that of the aqueous
phase, which is in turn embedded in a dielectric continuum of constant ε2.
We shall refer to this kind of ionic transfer as a transfer through a ”water
peel (WP)” mechanism. If we calculate the electrostatic free energy change
for this process according to the spirit of Born’s model, we get:

1
ε2rs (cid:27)

− 1
rs (cid:21)

elec = − q2
2r0ε1

q2
2 (cid:26)
where q represents charge of the ion. However, a very important element is
missing in this model, as can be understood from the following argument.
The presence of the aqueous solvation sheet makes the ion more stable in
the organic phase, and this stability increases as rs increases. Thus, on
electrostatic grounds rs should increase indeﬁnitely to stabilize the ion as
much as possible. The reason for this not to happen is that the creation of
the water layer in the organic phase must have some cost, this depending on

(2)

4

the radius rs. Note that these considerations are absent in A&L5, where the
water layer is somewhat arbitrarily (but very reasonably) assumed to be of
one water molecular diameter. According to the previous argument, we shall
write the free energy of transfer according to:

transf = − q2

1
ε1 (cid:20)
where γ denotes the surface tension of a water/organic solvent interface.
Thus, the three terms on the r.h.s. of eqn. 3 represent the solvation energy
of the ion in the aqueous phase, the solvation energy in the mixed phase and
the free energy required to create the new surface originated by the water
sphere of radius rs, respectively. The last term looks like the solvophobic
term discussed by Markin and Volkov [23] when considering the contribution
of the solvophobic eﬀect to the resolvation energy. However, it is clear that
it has here quite a diﬀerent meaning, since rs is no longer the ionic radius
but that of the hydrated ion.

On the other hand, the transfer of an alkaline ion from the aqueous to
the organic phase without the aqueous solvation sheet would involve the
contribution:

r0 (cid:20)
We are aware that we actually should use instead of this equation a similar
one taking into account that the cavity radius produced by a particular ion
will vary in diﬀerent solvents [31], but we postpone this discussion for below.
Thus, the fact whether the ion will be transferred with an aqueous sol-
vation sheet or not, will depend on the relative magnitudes of the processes
involved in 3 and 4. Simpliﬁcation of eqn. 3 yields:

Note that according to this expression ∆G′

trans is independent of the
ionic radius, in agreement with the experimental observation for the smaller
alkaline ions. We will now analyze under which conditions the processes
related to 4 or 5 should prevail. We illustrate this point in Figure 2, where
we make a qualitative plot of ∆Gtrans and ∆G′
trans as a function of the

radius of the aqueous sphere surrounding the ion. Three diﬀerent situations

intersect in two points, and there exists an inﬁnity of values of rs which
allow the inequality ∆G′
trans < ∆Gtrans. Alkaline ion WP transfer should be
the predominant mechanism for the ion transfer in this case. In the second
(Figure 2b), there is only one point in which we get ∆G′
trans = ∆Gtrans. In
the third case, we get ∆G′
trans > ∆Gtrans for all rs, so that ion WP transfer
should not occur.

The relevance of the physical parameters involved in the present model
may be envisaged from the following analysis. Let us set the necessary con-
dition for a minimum in eqn. 3 according to:

mum:

imply the condition :

If we now substitute rmin

aqueous phase to an organic one: the surface tension of the corresponding
water/organic interface, the ionic radius and the charge of the ion. Thus, for a
given water/organic interface, the ionic transfer through the WP mechanism
will be favored for interfaces with the lower surface tension and ions with the
smaller radii and the higher charges. In order to make a quantitative test of
these ideas, we have plotted in Figure 3 the standard Gibbs energies for the
transfer of some univalent ions from water to 1,2-dichloroethane, obtained
from electrochemical measurements[29][30] as a function of the reciprocal of
the ionic radius. In Figure 3a we used the ionic radius as usually reported in
textbooks[34], and in Figure 3b we employed the corrected radius as quoted
by Rashin and Honig [31]. This corresponds to the choice of ionic radii for
anions and covalent radii for cations, all increased by 7 %. Although there
remain some diﬀerences between anions and cations, the latter choice seems
to be more adequate for this representation . In the case of all the anions and
the bigger cations, an increase of ∆Gtrans with 1/r0 is found, a fact which was
predicted by eqn. 4. The diﬀerences observed between cations and anions
may be attributed to the fact of using the same r0 irrespective of the solvent.
It has been pointed out in the literature that diﬀerent radii for the cavity
surrounding the ions are expected, especially when the solvents involved have
a diﬀerent polarity [31]. On the other hand, a remarkable deviation from the
linear behavior is found in the case of the smaller cations Li+ and Na+.
Furthermore, the experimental ∆Gtrans is not found to change with the ionic
radius, a feature which was anticipated in the discussion given above by eqn.
8. Due to the simplicity of the present model, only a qualitative description
of the direct transfer can be pursued here. However, we can attempt an
improvement in terms of dielectric saturation eﬀects as proposed in A&L3.
Thus, eq. 5 can be replaced by:

where ε1(r) and ε2(r) are now electric ﬁeld dependent functions as given in
A&L3. These can be calculated numerically by solving the equation ε =

These are given in Table 2 along with the more approximate values stemming
from Born’s theory. These values point towards a hydration sheet close
to a molecular diameter, as suggested in A&L5 and the value for ∆G′
trans
reasonably agrees with the experimental ﬁnding for Li+and Na+, where we
expect WP transfer to take place. Since there is theoretical evidence that the
surface tension of small drops should decrease with increasing curvature[35],
we expect from eq. 10 that the hydration extent in the organic phase should
be somewhat larger than what we calculate here. However, the minimum
described by this equation is relatively ﬂat so that important changes in
the hydration extent should not appreciably change the values of ∆G′
transwe
report here. A further comment is also relevant concerning the accuracy of
eq. 10. We expect the values obtained from it for WP transfer to be much
more accurate that any estimation of transfer free energy that can be made
for ion transfer without hydration. In fact, if we assume that the structure of
the hydration sheet remains essentially unaltered in the organic phase, this
equation reduces to:

the integral being extended over regions relatively far from the ion. This
would naturally not be the case for an analogous extension of eq. 4 to
consider dielectric saturation, which would result in:

The value of integral is here according to our experience extremely sensi-
tive to assumptions made concerning the structure of the dielectric media in
the neighborhood of the ion.

Returning to our discussion above, it seems that hydration in the organic
phase should only occur for the smaller ions. However, the model given
above is only adequate to describe a complete solvation layer, and hydration
by one or a couple of water molecules may occur. A rough estimation of the
free energy decrease ∆Grepl that accompanies the replacement of part of the
organic solvation layer by a single water molecule may be made according
to the following argument. We divide the free energy change related to this

(11)

(12)

hydration process in two parts. One corresponding to the ion-dipole inter-
actions ∆Gi−dip and another one corresponding to dipole-dipole interactions
∆G0
dip−dip. The change related to the ion-dipole interactions can be written
as:

∆G0

ion−dip = −

q2
H2O r2
n2

i−H2O

µH2O < cos ΘH2O > +

µDCE < cos ΘDCE >

ρDCE
ρH2O

q2
DCE r2
n2

i−DCE

(13)
where n labels the refractive index, µ the dipole moment, ρ the number
density and < cos Θ > the average orientation of water (H2O) and 1,2-
dichloroethane (DCE) dipoles respectively. The ion-dipole distances denoted
as ri−H2O and ri−DCE can be taken to be equal to the sum of the ionic radius
plus the corresponding molecular radius. The average orientation can be es-
timated using Langevin’s equation L(x) = coth(x) − 1/x with x = Eµ/kT.
Thus, the ﬁrst term on the r.h.s of eq. 13 represents the free energy decrease
when the ion is solvated by a water dipole, and the second term represents
the corresponding free energy increase due to desolvation of the correspond-
ing part of the organic solvent. The values obtained from this equation are
shown in Table 3 for the diﬀerent ions considered here. As an estimation for
the ∆G0
dip−dip term we consider the free energy change corresponding to the
dissolution of water in 1,2-dichloroethane at the saturation concentration,
that can in principle be obtained from solubility data of H2O in 1, 2 − DCE.
Since these solubility values reported in the literature [36] vary between 0.1
M and 10−3M, we estimated ∆G0
dip−dip to be in the range 10 − 30KJ/mol.
Whatever the accurate value, we see that within the present approximation
practically all the ions considered in Table 3 should prefer solvation with one
water molecule to be anhydrous in the organic solvent. Moreover, since the
resulting values for ∆G0
dip−dip are of the same order
of magnitude that a reasonable calculation or free energy of transfer with-
out hydration would yield, we expect that even solvation with a single water
molecule should deliver a meaningful contribution to this process.

ion−dip + ∆G0

repl = ∆G0

A more quantitative approach would require a simulation based on realis-
tic potentials describing the ion-water, ion- 1,2-DCE and all the intermolec-
ular interactions. In this respect, it is worth mentioning here the interesting
results of the simulation performed by Benjamin[20]concerning the transfer
of an ion from a nonpolar to a polar phase. In the case where the liquid-liquid

9

interface is not forced to be sharp but a wider transition region is allowed, an
important part of the polar solvent solvation shell is already formed around
the ion when it is still on the nonpolar side of the liquid-liquid interface. It
would be thus worthwhile to perform this type of simulation with more spe-
ciﬁc potentials for the diﬀerent ions. This would provide an important test
to the present ideas. Determination of standard free energies for the transfer
of alkaline-earth ions will be also helpful to distinguish between a WP or a
”dry ” transfer . In fact, any electrostatic estimation of the standard Gibbs
energies of the dry transfer should scale in a ﬁrst approximation with q2, as
predicted by Born’s equation. On the other hand, replacing eqn. 7 into eqn.
8 yields:

(14)

Thus, the WP transfer free energies are expected to scale with q(4/3),

which is much weaker than the q2 dependence given above.

We can summarize the present results saying that we have clariﬁed some
aspects of direct ion transfer across the water/1,2 dichloroethane by using a
very simple model based on thermodynamic considerations. We believe that
ion solvation by water molecules may occur in some particular cases in the
organic phase, delivering an important contribution to the Gibbs free energy
of ion transfer between the aqueous and the organic phase. This particular
type of transfer should be favored in the case of highly charged small ions, at
interfaces with a relatively low surface tension and a large diﬀerence between
the reciprocal of the corresponding dielectric constants.

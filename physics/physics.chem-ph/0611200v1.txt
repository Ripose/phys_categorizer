We introduce a short-range correlation density functional deﬁned with respect to a multi-
determinantal reference which is meant to be used in a multi-determinantal extension of the Kohn-
Sham scheme of density functional theory based on a long-range/short-range decomposition of the
Coulomb electron-electron interaction. We construct the local density approximation for this func-
tional and discuss its performance on the He atom.

I.

INTRODUCTION

One of the main diﬃculties in the Kohn-Sham (KS) [1]
scheme of density functional theory (DFT) [2] is to ﬁnd
approximations for the exchange-correlation energy func-
tional that correctly describe (near-)degeneracy or long-
range (e.g., van der Waals) correlation eﬀects. To cir-
cumvent this diﬃculty, a multi-determinantal extension
of the KS scheme based on a long-range/short-range de-
composition of the Coulomb electron-electron interaction
has been proposed [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. The
idea behind this separation is that correlation eﬀects due
to the short-range part, involving the correlation cusp,
could well be described by the local density approxima-
tion (appropriately modiﬁed); correlation connected with
the long-range part could well be dealt with using stan-
dard wave-function methods of quantum chemistry.

In this approach, the ground-state energy of a N -
electron system in a nuclei-electron potential vne(r

¯
obtained in principle exactly by minimization over multi-
determinantal wave functions Ψ

equations, µ is a parameter controlling the range of the
decomposition of the Coulomb interaction. In practice,
approximations must be used for the wave function Ψlr,µ
and the short-range functionals Esr,µ
[n]. In
particular, the local density approximations have been
[n] and ¯Esr,µ
constructed for Esr,µ
[n] [5, 13]. For µ = 0,
Eq. (1) reduces to the KS scheme. In fact, in this case,

Former experience with Eq. (1) has shown that in gen-
eral the quality of the wave-function Ψlr,µ obtained with
a given approximate functional is much better than that
of the functional itself. To extract the maximum infor-
mation from Ψlr,µ, we propose in this work to compute
the ground-state energy as

We note that Eq. (2) can formally be made self-
consistent by generalizing the “optimized eﬀective po-
tential” (OEP) approach (see, e.g., Refs. 14, 15) to the
multi-determinantal extension of the KS scheme

the KS theory when µ = 0. In this case, in fact, Ψlr,µ=0
sr,µ=0
is the KS determinant and the functional ¯E
c,md [n] re-
duces to the correlation functional of the KS theory. In
practice, because the potential corresponding to the func-
sr,µ
tional derivative of ¯E
c,md[n] is small, we expect that the

c

corrections on Ψlr,µ brought by self-consistency are negli-
gible with respect to the errors due to the approximations
on ¯E

sr,µ
c,md[n] [16].

This work is devoted to the study of the functional
sr,µ
¯E
c,md[n]: we turn our attention entirely to the correla-
tion energy, without combining it with an approximate
functional for exchange. It is thus a pleasure to dedicate
this paper to Professor Hermann Stoll who has been a pi-
oneer in the study and application of correlation energy
density functionals [17, 18].

The paper is organized as follows. In Sec II, we dis-
sr,µ
cuss the short-range correlation functional ¯E
c,md[n] and
its relation to the functional ¯Esr,µ
In Sec. III, we
sr,µ
construct a local density approximation for ¯E
c,md[n]. In
Sec. IV, we assess the accuracy of this approximation for
the He atom. Sec. V contains our conclusions. Atomic
units (a.u.) are used throughout this work.

The short-range correlation functional ¯E

Eq. (2) is deﬁned with respect to the multi-determinantal
wave function Ψlr,µ, in contrast to the short-range corre-
lation functional ¯Esr,µ
[n] in Eq. (1) deﬁned with respect
to the one-determinant wave function Φ.
It is easy to
see that these two functionals are related to each other

The quantity ∆lr−sr,µ vanishes for µ = 0 and µ → ∞.

It is interesting to study the behavior of ¯E

limit of a very short-range interaction, i.e. when µ → ∞.
In this limit, the short-range interaction behaves as [12]

compute the term ∆

tional of Eq. (9). In order to estimate ∆
unif
ceed as follows. We ﬁrst notice that wsr,µ
ee (r) = erfc(µr)/r
in the integrand of Eq. (11) only samples the part of
lr,µ
c,unif(r, n) corresponding to r . 1/µ. For the standard
g
uniform electron gas (with full interaction 1/r) the “ex-
tended Overhauser model” [20] proved to be able to yield
accurate results for gc,unif(r, n) in the short-range region
deﬁned by r ≤ rs, where rs = (4π n/3)−1/3. We can thus

use this simple model to calculate g
(n) that should be reliable

The scattering equations of the “extended Overhauser
model” are widely explained in Refs. 20, 21. Here we
solved the same equations with the electron-electron in-
teraction erf(µr)/r screened by a sphere of radius rs of
uniform positive charge density n and attracting the elec-
trons with the same modiﬁed interaction,

This potential is reported in the Appendix of Ref. 22,
where it has been used for two-electron atoms with
very accurate results for the corresponding short-range
correlation energy. Veﬀ (r, rs, µ) is a screened potential
that tends to the “Overhauser potential” [20, 23] when
µ → ∞, and which goes to zero when µ → 0. As in the
original work of Overhauser [23], the idea behind Eq. (12)
is that the radius of the screening “hole” is exactly equal
to rs.

tween our data and zero, since, as explained in Sec. II,

c,md have been calculated with a precision
c
of the order of 1 mH as follows. An accurate density is
calculated at the full conﬁguration interaction level with

a large Gaussian basis set and the optimization of the
potential in the Legendre transform formulation [25, 26]
of density functionals enables to compute accurately the

V. CONCLUSIONS

In this work, we have

reexamined the multi-
determinantal extension of the KS scheme based on a
long-range/short-range decomposition of the Coulomb
electron-electron interaction. Contrary to previous works
where the short-range correlation functional was deﬁned
with respect to the KS determinant, we have introduced
a new short-range correlation functional deﬁned with re-
spect to the multi-determinantal wave function. We have
constructed the local density approximation for this new
functional. The example of the He atom suggests that
the local density approximation is essentially as accurate
as for the short-range correlation functional deﬁned with
respect to the KS determinant. We believe that this work
paves the way to a multi-determinantal extension of the
KS scheme using a correlation-only density functional.

structure calculation on heavy- and superheavy-element

compounds

The methods which are actively used for electronic structure calculations of low-

lying states of heavy- and superheavy-element compounds are brieﬂy described. The

advantages and disadvantages of the Dirac-Coulomb-Breit Hamiltonian, Huzinaga-

type potential, shape-consistent Relativistic Eﬀective Core Potential (RECP) and

Generalized RECP are discussed. The nonvariational technique of the electronic

structure restoration in atomic cores after the RECP calculation of a molecule is

presented. The features of the approaches accounting for electron correlation, the

conﬁguration interaction and coupled cluster methods, are also described. The re-

sults of calculations on E113, E114, U and other heavy-atom systems are presented.

I.

INTRODUCTION

High-precision calculations of molecules with heavy and superheavy atoms that provide

“chemical accuracy” (1 kcal/mol or 350 cm−1) for excitation and dissociation energies of

low-lying states are extremely time-consuming. Employing the latest theoretical and

program developments is necessary on the following stages:

(A) selection of an eﬀective spin-dependent Hamiltonian;

(B) basis set optimization;

(C) appropriate way of accounting for correlation.

∗Electronic address: Titov@pnpi.spb.ru; URL: http://qchem.pnpi.spb.ru

In order to minimize the computational eﬀorts necessary to provide a given accuracy

in calculation of properties, it is important to achieve the equivalent (balanced) level of

accuracy in each of these stages in the most economical way. Moreover, too high accuracy

which can be formally attained at the ﬁrst two stages by, e.g., (a) employing an eﬀective

Hamiltonian, in which inactive core electrons are treated explicitly or/and (b) using a too

large basis set etc. can result in abnormal requirements to computers at the last stage.

In the present paper, the main attention is paid on items (A) and (C). The Dirac-

Coulomb-Breit (DCB) Hamiltonian and the Relativistic Eﬀective Core Potential (RECP)

method which are widely employed [at stage (A)] are described in sections II and III.

The Conﬁguration Interaction (CI) and Coupled Cluster (CC) methods which are most

popular in correlation calculations, [at stage (C)] are presented in sections IV and V.

In opposite to the density functional approaches, the CI and CC methods allows one to

study excited electronic states of a given symmetry with high level of accuracy.

II. DIRAC-COULOMB(-BREIT) HAMILTONIAN

It is well known that the Dirac-Coulomb (DC) Hamiltonian with the Breit interaction

and other Quantum ElectroDynamic (QED) corrections taken into account provide a

very high accuracy of calculations of heavy atoms and heavy-atom molecules. The DC

Hamiltonian has the form (in atomic units e = m = ¯h = 1, where e and m are the electron

charge and mass, ¯h is Planck constant):

HDC =

hD(p) +

Xp

1
rpq

,

Xp>q

where indices p, q run over all the electrons in an atom or molecule, rpq is the distance

between electrons p and q, and the one-electron Dirac operator hD is

hD = c(~α · ~p) + mc2(β − 1) + V nuc ,

c is the speed of light, V nuc is the nuclear potential including the eﬀect of ﬁnite nuclear
~p=−i~∇ is the electron momentum operator, ~α, β are the 4×4 Dirac matrices.

size etc.,

The lowest-order QED correction includes the interelectronic exchange by one trans-

verse photon. In the Coulomb gauge, it leads to so-called Dirac-Coulomb-Breit Hamilto-

These terms describe the instantaneous magnetostatic interaction and classical retardation

of the electric interaction between electrons. The contribution from the ﬁrst term (called

Gaunt interaction) to transition energies and hyperﬁne structure (HFS) constants can be

observed in atomic Dirac-Hartree-Fock (DHF) calculations (tables I and II).

The one-electron basis functions in calculations with the DC(B) Hamiltonian are the

four-component Dirac spinors. The DC(B)-based calculations have the following disad-

vantages:

- too many electrons are treated explicitly in heavy-atom systems and too large basis

set of Gaussians is required for accurate description of the large number of oscilla-

tions which valence spinors have in the case of a heavy atom;

- the necessity to work with the four-component Dirac spinors leads to serious com-

plication of calculations as compared to the nonrelativistic case.

III. RELATIVISTIC EFFECTIVE CORE POTENTIALS

In calculations on heavy-atom molecules, the DC and DCB Hamiltonians are usually

replaced by an eﬀective Hamiltonian

HEf =

[hSchr(pv) + UEf (pv)] +

Xpv

1
rpvqv

,

Xpv>qv

(6)

written only for valence or “valence-extended” (when some outermost core shells are

treated explicitly) subspace of electrons denoted by indices pv and qv; UEf is an RECP

4

(7)

operator simulating, in particular, interactions of the explicitly treated electrons with

those which are excluded from the RECP calculation. In Eq. (6),

hSchr = −

~∇2 + V nuc

1
2

is the one-electron operator of the nonrelativistic Schr¨odinger Hamiltonian. Contrary to

the four-component wave function used in DC(B) calculations, the pseudo-wave function

in the RECP case can be both two- and one-component.

A. Huzinaga-type potential

When forming chemical bonds in heavy-atom molecules, states of core electrons are

practically unchanged. To reduce computational eﬀorts in expensive molecular calcula-

tions, the “frozen core” approximation is often employed.

In order to “freeze” core (c) spinors, the energy level shift technique can be applied. Fol-

lowing Huzinaga, et al. [1], one should add the matrix elements of the Hartree-Fock (HF)

ﬁeld operators, the Coulomb (J) and spin-dependent exchange (K) terms, over these core

spinors to the one-electron part of the Hamiltonian together with the level shift terms as

the eﬀective core operator UEf

Huz:

UEf

Huz = (J−K)[ϕnclj] +

Bnclj |ϕncljihϕnclj|

(i.e. εnclj → εnclj+Bnclj) ,

(8)

Xnc,l,j

where nc, l and j are the principal, orbital momentum and total momentum quantum

numbers, the Bnclj parameters are at least of order |2εnclj| and εnclj is the one-electron

energy of the core spinor ϕnclj that is frozen. Such nonlocal terms are needed in order

to prevent collapse of the valence electrons to the frozen core states. As it will be shown

below, all the terms with the frozen core spinors (the level shift operator and exchange

interactions) can be transformed to the spin-orbit representation in addition to the spin-

independent Coulomb term.

B. Shape-consistent radially-local RECPs

In other RECP versions, the valence spinors are smoothed in the core regions. Consider

the shape-consistent radially-local (or semi-local) RECP developed by K. Pitzer’s group [2,

5

(9)

3]. The nodeless numerical pseudospinors

ϕnvlj(r) are constructed of the large components

Pnvlj(r) of the valence (v) DHF spinors (one pseudospinor for each l and j):

ϕnvlj(r) = 


e



Pnvlj(r) ,
f (r) = rγ

r ≥ Rc ,

i=0 airi, r < Rc ,

P

where r is the distance between the nucleus and electron. The matching (or core) radius,

Rc, is chosen near the outermost extremum for the large component and the ai coeﬃcients

are taken such that the pseudospinors are smooth and nodeless. The power γ is typically

chosen higher than l + 1 to ensure an eﬃcient ejection of the valence electrons from the

core region.

To derive the RECP components Ulj, the HF equations are inverted for the valence

pseudospinors so that

ϕnvlj become solutions of the nonrelativistic-type HF equations

(but with j-dependent potentials) for a “pseudoatom” with removed core electrons [4]:

(12)

the RECP operator can be rewritten in the spin-orbit representation, where ~l and ~s are

operators of the orbital and spin momenta, ml is the projection of the orbital momentum.

Similar to Huzinaga-type potentials, the shape-consistent radially-local RECPs allows

one to exclude chemically inactive electrons already from the RECP/SCF stage of calcu-

lations. Moreover, they have the following advantages:

6

⋆ The oscillations of the explicitly treated spinors are smoothed in the core regions of

heavy atoms when generating nodeless pseudospinors. Therefore, the number of the

one-electron Gaussian basis functions may be minimized, thus reducing dramatically

both the number of two-electron integrals and the computational time.

⋆ The small components of the four-component spinors are eliminated and the non-

relativistic kinetic energy operator is used. The RECP method allows one to use

a well-developed nonrelativistic technique of calculation and relativistic eﬀects are

taken into account with the help of spin-dependent semi-local potentials. Breit

and other two-electron QED interactions can be eﬃciently treated within the one-

electron RECPs.

⋆ In principle, correlations of the explicitly treated electrons with those which are

excluded from the RECP calculation can be considered within “correlated” RECP

versions. Reducing the number of explicitly correlated electrons with the help of

the correlated RECPs is a very promising way to minimize eﬀorts when performing

high-precision molecular calculations.

The disadvantages of the semi-local RECPs are:

- By now, diﬀerent versions of the radially-local RECPs provide a comparable level of

accuracy for the same number of the explicitly treated electrons. It is clear that the

explicit inclusion of the outer core electrons into the RECP calculation is the way to

increase the accuracy. However, the extension of the space of these electrons more

than some limit does not improve the accuracy as is obtained in all our calculations

with RECPs. The RECP errors still range up to 1000–3000 cm−1 and more even

for the dissociation of the lowest-lying states and for energies of transition between

them.

- The reliability of the radially-local RECP versions is not high for transitions with

the excitations in d, f -shells in transition metals, lanthanides, actinides, etc.

- Moreover, the direct calculation of such properties as electronic densities near heavy

nuclei, HFS, and matrix elements of other operators singular on heavy nuclei is

impossible as a result of smoothing the spinors in the core regions of heavy elements.

7

To overcome the above disadvantages, the Generalized RECP (GRECP) method (see

subsection III C) and the One-Center Restoration (OCR) procedures (see subsection III D)

were developed.

C. Generalized RECP

It was shown in paper [6] that a requirement for pseudospinors to be nodeless is not nec-

essary to generate the shape-consistent RECP components. In the case of pseudospinors

with nodes, the RECP components are singular because division by zero appears in

Eq. (10). This problem is overcome in the GRECP method by interpolating the potentials

in the vicinity of these nodes. It was shown both theoretically and computationally that

the interpolation errors are small enough. This allows one to generate diﬀerent potentials,

Unclj and Unvlj, for outer core and valence pseudospinors, unlike the conventional RECP

approach.

The GRECP operator is written in the form [7]:

UGRECP =

The new non-local terms (the second and third lines in the above equation) were added to

the conventional semi-local RECP operator. These terms take into account the diﬀerence

between the eﬀective potentials acting on the outer core and valence electrons with the

same l and j quantum numbers.

The GRECP method allows one to improve accuracy of calculations by regular manner

when including more outer core shells explicitly into the GRECP calculations. More

details on the GRECP method can be found in [8, 9]. To compare diﬀerent eﬀective

potential versions by accuracy, we carried out both all-electron calculations with the

DC Hamiltonian and calculations with RECPs of diﬀerent groups. The RECP errors in

8

reproducing the DHF all-electron results are studied in [8, 9] etc. One can see from our

atomic HF calculations [10] and correlation calculations on the Hg [11] and Pb [12] atoms,

that the accuracy of the GRECP is up to an order of magnitude higher than that of the

other tested RECPs even for the cases when the same number of only outermost core

shells is treated explicitly.

Results for the eka-thallium atom (E113) are presented in table III. The GRECP errors

are collected into two groups. The errors for transitions without change in the occupation

number of the 6d shell are rather small. The errors for transitions with change in the

occupation number of the 6d shell are about 400 cm−1. The latter errors have a systematic

nature and are connected with the fact that the 6d shell in the present GRECP version is

described with the help of nodeless pseudospinors. Of course, these errors can be reduced

signiﬁcantly if one includes the 5d electrons explicitly in the GRECP calculations. The

Self-Consistent (SfC) RECP method was suggested in [8, 13], it allows one to minimize

the above mentioned errors without extension of space of explicitly treated electrons.

New terms with an operator of the occupation number of the outermost d (or f ) shell

are added to the RECP operator. This method is most optimal for studying compounds

of transition metals, lanthanides, and actinides. The comparison of accuracy of diﬀerent

RECP versions in calculations on the uranium atom can be found in table IV and in

papers [8, 13].

D. Nonvariational One-Center Restoration of electronic structure in cores of

heavy-atoms in a molecule (NOCR)

In the valence region, the electronic density obtained from the two-component GRECP

(pseudo)wave function very accurately reproduces the corresponding all-electron four-

component density.

In the core region, the pseudospinors are smoothed, so that the

electronic density with the (pseudo)wave function is not correct.

The following restoration scheme was developed (see [14, 15] and references):

• Generation of equivalent basis sets of atomic (one-center) four-component spinors

{ ˜fnlj(r)χljmj } by atomic ﬁnite-diﬀerence (numerical) all-electron DHF and two-
component GRECP/HF calculations of the same valence conﬁgurations of the atom

and its ions.

• The molecular pseudospinorbitals ˜φi are then expanded in the basis set of the one-

center two-component atomic pseudospinors (for r≤Rrest

, where Rrest

c ≥Rc),

c

Lmax

l+1/2

˜φi(x) ≈

Xl=0

Xj=|l−1/2| Xn,mj

˜fnlj(r)χljmj ,

(14)

where x denotes spatial and spin variables.

• Finally, the atomic two-component pseudospinors are replaced by the equivalent

four-component spinors in the molecular basis and the expansion coeﬃcients ci

nljmj

from Eq. (14) are preserved:

Lmax

l+1/2






(15)

The molecular four-component spinors constructed this way are orthogonal to the

inner core spinors of the heavy atom, as the atomic basis functions used in Eq. (15) are

generated with the inner core electrons treated as frozen. The properties described by the

operators singular close to (heavy) nuclei are calculated with the restored bispinors φi .

More advanced technique of the variational restoration is proposed in [15].

bination of determinants DI

are some numbers (CI coeﬃcients).

In turn, each N-electron determinant is an

anti-symmetric production of N one-electron basis functions where N is the number of

electrons in the considered system. The CI equations are written as

(16)

(17)

HIJ C CI

J = ECIC CI
I

,

XJ

10

where HIJ are Hamiltonian matrix elements in the basis set of the determinants and ECI

is the CI energy. To ﬁnd the coeﬃcients and the energy in the CI method, one should

diagonalize the Hamiltonian matrix.

If all possible determinants are considered then the method (called Full-CI) will provide

the “exact” solution in the framework of a given one-electron basis set and an employed

Hamiltonian. However, requirements to the computational resources in the Full-CI case

are usually so huge that such calculations are practically impossible for systems of interest

except the cases of very small numbers of correlated electrons and basis functions.

In

almost all the CI calculations, only some selected (the most important) determinants

are explicitly considered. To take into account the eﬀect of the unselected determinants,

various semi-empirical corrections (e.g., the Davidson correction [16]) can be employed.

In precise calculations, the number of selected determinants reaches a few millions and

more, therefore a very large Hamiltonian matrix should be diagonalised. The iterative

diagonalization (Davidson) method is then used to obtain a few low-lying roots of this

matrix.

There are two main categories of the CI method [17]:

• “Conventional CI”: the Hamiltonian matrix elements are calculated once and saved

in memory,

open shells;

correlations.

• “Direct CI”: only those Hamiltonian matrix elements are calculated at each step of

the diagonalization procedure which are required at the moment.

The CI method has the following advantages:

⋆ simplicity of the method, solutions are always exist independently of the number of

⋆ it well describes “static” (avoided crossing of terms) and “nondynamic” electron

The disadvantages of the CI method are:

- it is badly working for large number of correlated electrons (when semi-empirical

corrections on unselected determinants are large);

- unsmoothness of potential curves is a result of selection of determinants by some

thresholds;

than spectroscopic properties.

- the above semi-empirical energy corrections cannot be used when calculating other

V. THE COUPLED-CLUSTER APPROACHES

The complete space of {DI} is divided into two subspaces:

M0 , model space, consists of small number (M) of the most important determinants

{Dm}M

m=1 to describe static and nondynamic correlations, which are taken into

account exactly on M0;

M⊥

, rest of space (usually very large), is included approximately to account for dynamic

correlations (i.e. correlations at small interelectronic distances, “Coulomb holes”).

If all the T (m)

are considered in the T (m) operator then the CC method is equivalent

to the Full-CI one. However, in practical calculations, the third and following terms in

T (m) (three-body and higher order cluster amplitudes) are usually neglected. Such a CC

version is called CC-SD. There are three basic CC categories [18]:

12

• One-state or state-selective;

• Fock-space or valence universal methods;

• Hilbert-space or state-universal approaches.

The CC method has the following advantages:

⋆ It is the size-extensive method, i.e. the energy of the system is scaled properly with

increase in the number of electrons (whereas the CI method is not size-extensive in

a general case).

⋆ The CC-SD method takes into account the contributions not only from the de-

terminants of the model space by applying the (1+T (m)

1 +T (m)

2

) operator but also

approximately from all the rest determinants (whereas the CI method with the same

number of unknown coeﬃcients does not).

⋆ The CC method is one of the best methods for accounting the dynamic correlation.

The disadvantages of the CC method are:

- This is a nonvariational method, i.e. the CC energy is not an upper bound to the

exact energy of the system (whereas the CI energy is).

- The CC equations are nonlinear and the eﬀective Hamiltonian is non-Hermitian.

- Intruder states (i.e. such states from the M⊥

0 subspace, which are lying within the
M0 subspace energy span) destroy the convergence of the CC iterations. Alleviation

the problem is in using:

• Incomplete model space procedures;

• Energy shifting, RLE [19], DIIS [20, 21], IPM [22] procedures.

VI.

SOME PRACTICAL CALCULATIONS

Calculations of the spectroscopic constants for the ground and lowest excited states

of the HgH molecule and for the ground state of the HgH+ ion were carried out with

the help of the GRECP and relativistic CC methods in [23]. The results are within

a few mbohr from the experimental data for bond lengths, tens of wave numbers for

excitation energies and vibrational frequencies. It is demonstrated that the triple cluster

amplitudes for the 13 outermost electrons and corrections for the Basis Set Superposition

Errors (BSSE) [24, 25] are necessary to obtain accurate results for this molecule. The

accurate GRECP/CI calculations of the spectroscopic constant for the ground state of the

TlH molecule are presented in [26], in which the reliability of the semi-empirical energy

corrections is in particular investigated.

The NOCR scheme was applied in the GRECP/CC calculations of the P, T -odd proper-

ties for the TlF molecule [14]. The corresponding GRECP/HF/NOCR results are in good

agreement with the all-electron DHF results of other groups. Inclusion of electron corre-

lation has changed the values on 20%. The previous NOCR version was employed in the

GRECP calculations of the P, T -odd parameters and HFS constants for the YbF [27, 28]

and BaF [29] molecules. A reasonable agreement with the experimental data for the HFS

constants was attained. It was demonstrated that the spin-correlation eﬀects of the un-

paired electron with the deeply-lying outer core 5s and 5p shells should be taken into

account in order to perform accurate calculations of the HFS and P, T -odd constants.

a The magnetic moment µN and spin I for the Eka-thallium nucleus were taken as those for Thallium.
The presented results can be easily recalculated as only the proper values of µN and I are known because
they just include the µN /I coeﬃcient.

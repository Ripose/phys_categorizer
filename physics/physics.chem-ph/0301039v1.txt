Abstract

The most widely-used density functionals for the exchange-correlation energy are inexact

for one-electron systems. Their self-interaction errors can be severe in some applications. The

problem is not only to correct the self-interaction error, but to do so in a way that will not

violate size-consistency and will not go outside the standard Kohn-Sham density functional

theory. The solution via the optimized eﬀective potential (OEP) method will be discussed, ﬁrst

for the Perdew-Zunger self-interaction correction (whose performance for molecules is brieﬂy

summarized) and then for the more modern self-interaction corrections based upon unitarily-

invariant indicators of iso-orbital regions. For the latter approaches, the OEP construction is
greatly simpliﬁed. The kinetic-energy-based iso-orbital indicator τ W
σ (r)/τσ(r) will be discussed
and plotted, along with an alternative exchange-based indicator.

Introduction

Paradoxically, some of the most widely-used and reliable theoretical approaches to many-electron

systems, including the local spin density [1] (LSD) and generalized gradient [2] (GGA) approxi-

mations, are not exact for one-electron systems. The error they make in these systems is called

the self-interaction error. An early self-interaction correction [3, 4] (SIC) to LSD led to dramatic

successes and failures, and has been largely bypassed by the development of GGA, which provides a

more uniform improvement over LSD and has an easier Kohn-Sham theory implementation. Since

the time ﬁnally seems ripe for the development of reliable self-interaction-free approximations, this

article will discuss some of the possibilities for self-interaction correction within Kohn-Sham density

functional theory [1].

Since the Kohn-Sham orbitals ϕασ(r) are functionals [1] of the spin densities n↑ and n↓, so is Ts.
While the equations of the previous paragraph are exact in principle, in practice Exc[n↑, n↓] =

These approximations are exact for a uniform density and accurate for a slowly-varying n(r), but

are not exact for one electron densities.

One-electron densities are fully spin-polarized (e.g., n↑ = n and n↓ = 0).

In a one electron

much like that of the exact Exc[n↑, n↓].

There is no unique way to make a self-interaction correction, and alternatives to Eqs. (13) –

(15) have been proposed [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. But Eqs. (13) – (15) have been widely tested for atoms

[3, 10, 11, 12, 13], atomic ions [14], molecules [15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25] and solids

[26, 27] (see earlier references in Ref. [19]). SIC is exact for one-electron systems, and usually

accurate for strongly localized electrons. For covalent molecules near equilibrium, it has been

argued [23, 24, 25] that the self-interaction error in LSD and GGA exchange [28] is needed to

mimic the eﬀect of static correlation on the electron density.

In applications to molecules, the performance of SIC is somewhat mixed. Total energies are

better than in LSD, and the highest occupied orbital energy is much closer to minus the ionization

potential than in LSD [16, 18]. The localized SIC valence orbitals correspond to the localized

bonds and lone pairs of chemical intuition [18]. SIC signiﬁcantly improves the energy barriers to

chemical reactions [17, 22], but net reaction energies are less strongly improved relative to LSD

3

[22]. Many nuclear magnetic resonance properties of molecules are improved by SIC [21]. There

are relatively few studies of atomization energies in SIC, but there seems to be an improvement

over LSD for the cases studied: Li2 [16], O2 [21], and N2 [24]. The most disappointing results are
the SIC bondlengths, which are shorter than the experimental ones by ≈ 0.07 bohr on average [18],

while the LSD bond lengths are much more realistic.

2 Perdew-Zunger SIC within Kohn-Sham Theory

The SIC of Eqs. (13) – (15) goes outside the Kohn-Sham scheme by introducing an orbital-dependent
eﬀective potential vασ
s (r). As a result, the self-consistent SIC orbitals are not Kohn-Sham orbitals,
and are not even strictly orthogonal unless oﬀ-diagonal Lagrange multipliers are introduced. The

SIC orbitals tend to localize around atomic centers, while the Kohn-Sham orbitals are delocalized

canonical or molecular orbitals. The SIC orbitals can be found, even for molecules, by directly

minimizing Eq. (13) under the constraint of orbital orthogonality [15, 16, 23, 24, 25].

Although not a Kohn-Sham theory, the Perdew-Zunger SIC belongs [3] to a wider class of density

functional theories. At least to the extent that the SIC orbitals are localized, it is also a size-

consistent theory [4], i.e., one which works consistently well for small or large systems.

But there are clearly computational and conceptual advantages to Kohn-Sham theory, not only

for the ground state but also for time-dependent processes and excitations. To bring SIC under

the umbrella of Kohn-Sham theory, one must construct a common eﬀective potential for all the

occupied orbitals of spin σ. Especially in the context of time-dependent DFT, diﬀerent procedures

emphasizing computational simplicity have been suggested to construct a common local potential

[29, 30, 31], and the inﬂuence of the self-interaction correction on optical properties of atoms [30],

the molecule N2 [32] and clusters [29, 33] has been discussed. A rigorous way of constructing a
common potential is given by the optimized eﬀective potential (OEP) method [34, 35, 36]. For

any orbital functional E[{ϕασ}], the OEP method delivers a Kohn-Sham potential and a set of
Kohn-Sham orbitals which minimize that functional. When the orbital functional is Hartree-Fock,

there is no problem, but when it is SIC (Eq. (13)) the resulting scheme is not size-consistent:

Applied to one atom, where all the Kohn-Sham orbitals are localized, this scheme will deliver a

properly self-interaction-corrected energy. But, applied to a periodic lattice of atoms separated by

large lattice constants, where all the Kohn-Sham orbitals are delocalized, this scheme will produce

no self-interaction correction to the energy of an atom, since the sum in Eq. (13) will then vanish

on a per-atom basis [3]. The considerations put forward in Refs. [3, 4] suggest that this is true

for all Perdew-Zunger-like SIC schemes that directly use the Kohn-Sham orbitals. Therefore, such

schemes would be good for atoms, but would degrade for molecules or clusters as the number of

4

atoms increased.

A clue to the solution of this problem was given in the work of Pederson, Heaton and Lin [16],

who introduced two sets of occupied orthonormal orbitals related by unitary transformation: the

localized SIC orbitals, and the delocalized canonical orbitals. Garza, Nichols and Dixon [20] pro-

posed that the canonical orbitals could be Kohn-Sham orbitals belonging to an optimized eﬀective
potential vσ
s (r) constructed from the localized orbitals. In their work, and in that of Patchovski
and Ziegler [21, 22], the Krieger-Li-Iafrate approximation [37] to OEP is used, as is a standard

(non-optimal) localizing transformation.

As an exactiﬁcation of this approach, the correct Kohn-Sham version of Perdew-Zunger SIC
would be conceptually this: Start with a given external potential vσ(r) and electron number N .
Form a trial eﬀective potential vσ
s (r), and solve Eq. (1) to ﬁnd the corresponding occupied Kohn-
Sham orbitals. Then ﬁnd the unitary transformation to localized orbitals that minimizes Eq. (13).

Finally, choose the eﬀective potential that delivers the lowest minimum of Eq. (13).

3 Unitarily Invariant Iso-Orbital Indicators

The prescription outlined above for the implementation of the Perdew-Zunger self-interaction cor-

rection to LSD (or GGA) within Kohn-Sham theory was greatly complicated by the fact that the

self-interaction correction was not invariant under a unitary transformation of the occupied orbitals.

This section will discuss self-interaction corrections that are unitarily invariant, and thus can be

implemented within Kohn-Sham theory by a direct application of the OEP method [34, 35, 36] to

the Kohn-Sham orbitals. This subject is timely because of the recent appearance of accurate and

eﬃcient solutions [35, 36] to the OEP problem.

A Slater determinant of occupied orbitals of a given spin σ is invariant under unitary transforma-

tion of those orbitals, and so is any quantity that can be constructed from the Slater determinant,

such as the spin density of Eq. (2) or the kinetic energy densities of Eqs. (7) and (8). The one-

electron density matrix

ρσ(r, r′) =

ασ(r)ϕασ(r′)Θ(µ − εασ)
ϕ∗

X

is also invariant. (The step function must of course be re-interpreted as a restriction to the occupied

orbital space.) The exact exchange energy

is clearly invariant, as is the the local exchange energy per electron ex(r):

On the “Jacob’s Ladder” [38] of density functional approximations, full freedom from self-

interaction error is achieved only at the hyper-GGA level, which employs full exact exchange and

a highly nonlocal functional of the occupied orbitals for correlation. A somewhat diﬀerent way to

eliminate the self-interaction error is via a local hybrid functional [39]. But in either case one needs

an iso-orbital indicator to identify regions of space in which the electron density is dominated by a

single orbital shape. The iso-orbital regions where n↑n↓ = 0 are one-electron regions in which the
correlation energy per electron ec(r) can and should be zeroed out by a self-correlation-free density
functional.

The exact exchange energy of Eq. (18) is self-interaction free, since for a one-electron (N = Nσ =

1) ground-state ρσ(r, r′) = n1/2

σ (r) n1/2

σ (r′). Thus

yσ(r, r′) =

σ (r′)

σ (r)n1/2
n1/2
ρσ(r, r′)

(20)

(22)

is an iso-orbital indicator which equals unity when both r and r′ are in an iso-orbital region.
However, as r′ → r, yσ(r, r′) tends to 1 in any region, iso-orbital or not. This problem does not
arise for

∇r · ∇r′n1/2

xσ(r) = lim
r′→r

σ (r)n1/2
∇r · ∇r′ρσ(r, r′)
Eq. (21) provides a point-by-point iso-orbital indicator which equals unity in any iso-orbital region
and is otherwise bounded between 0 and 1 [40]. In Eq. (21), τσ(r) is the kinetic energy density of
Eq. (8), and

is the von Weizs¨acker or bosonic kinetic energy density. For a uniform density, xσ(r) vanishes
everywhere.

xσ(r) of Eq. (21) is clearly invariant under unitary transformation of the occupied orbitals. The
idea of using the condition τσ(r) = τ W
σ (r) to identify an iso-orbital region and zero out the self-
correlation goes back to Colle and Salvetti [41], but in density functional theory to Becke [42] and
Dobson [43]. xσ(r) is an ingredient of self-correlation free meta-GGA’s including those of Refs. [44]
and [45], and of local hybrids [39] and hyper-GGA’s [38].

Fig. 1 shows xσ(r) of Eq. (21), plotted as a function of the distance from the center of two
spherical densities, the Ne atom and a jellium cluster with 34 electrons having the average valence
electron density of Na (rs = [3/(4πn)]1/3 = 3.93 bohr). xσ(r) correctly identiﬁes the density tails
as iso-orbital. In the Ne atom, the 1s core is also found to be nearly iso-orbital. The interior of

the jellium cluster, however, is found to be a region of strong orbital overlap, as expected. The

densities and orbitals have been evaluated by solving [34, 36] the OEP problem for exact exchange.

This problem shows up in nearly-iso-orbital (α → 0) regions where the gradient of the density

approaches zero (p → 0), and thus perhaps at covalent bond centers.

Because of the order-of-limits problem of τ W /τ , it may be worthwhile to consider alternative
iso-orbital indicators. For example, the exact exchange potential vx(r) and the exact exchange
energy per electron ex(r) (Eq. (19)) of a spin-unpolarized system are related in the iso-orbital limit

as an alternative iso-orbital indicator, which varies from 1 in the iso-orbital limit to 0 in the uniform

varies almost smoothly from 1 for the N = 2 jellium cluster to 0.4 for the largest cluster studied

here. Fig. 2 however shows that ˜x(r) of Eq. (27) can be negative, fails to recognize the 1s core of

the Ne atom as a strongly iso-orbital region, and fails to recognize the interior of the jellium cluster

as a region of strongly overlapped orbitals.

Thus it seems that xσ(r) of Eq. (21) is the preferred iso-orbital indicator. Note that Eq. (22)
assumes that the orbitals can be chosen to be real. If the state of interest has a nonzero current

4 Conclusions

For many standard applications of ground-state density functional theory, the self-interaction er-

rors of modern GGA’s and meta-GGA’s are relatively benign. There are a few striking exceptions

to this rule, such as the binding properties of diatomic molecules with an odd number of valence

electrons [19, 47] and the static (hyper-) polarizabilities of long-chain molecules [48]. For appli-

cations involving time-dependent and excited-state Kohn-Sham density functional theory [32, 49],

the self-interaction errors can be severe.

While the Perdew-Zunger self-interaction correction to the local spin density approximation can

now be brought under the umbrella of Kohn-Sham theory, the development of more sophisticated

functionals and optimized eﬀective potential methods suggests that general-purpose self-interaction-

free density functionals will be developed soon and implemented within Kohn-Sham theory. Such

functionals may well include full exact exchange plus highly nonlocal correlation based in part upon
unitarily-invariant iso-orbital indicators such as τ W

σ (r)/τσ(r).

Abstract

First theoretical analysis of the nuclear spin conversion in ethylene molecules
(13CCH4) has been performed. The conversion rate was found equal ≃ 3 ·
10−4 s−1/Torr, which is in qualitative agreement with the recently obtained

experimental value. It was shown that the ortho-para mixing in 13CCH4 is

dominated by the spin-rotation coupling. Mixing of only two pairs of ortho-

para levels were found to contribute signiﬁcantly to the spin conversion.

I. INTRODUCTION

Nuclear spin isomers of molecules were discovered nearly 70 years ago when ortho and

para hydrogen isomers were separated for the ﬁrst time. Although it was realized already at

the time of this discovery that many other symmetrical molecules have nuclear spin isomers

too, until recently almost nothing was known about isomers of molecules heavier than hy-

drogen. This happened because of the lack of practical separation methods. The separation

method based on deep cooling was applicable to hydrogen (and deuterium) but failed in

the case of heavier molecules. Presently a few new methods for spin isomer separation have

been proposed and successfully tested which has advanced this ﬁeld signiﬁcantly. Yet we

are at the very early stage of this research. The list of molecules for which the nuclear spin

isomers have been separated is rather short: H2 [1], CH3F [2], H2O [3], CH20 [4], Li2 [5], H+
3

[6], and C2H4 [7].

The CH3F molecules occupies a special place in this list because it is the only poly-

atomic molecule for which the isomer conversion mechanism has been identiﬁed. The CH3F
spin isomers appeared to be extremely stable surviving ∼ 109 gas collisions. Nevertheless,
the isomer conversion was found to be based on ortho-para state mixing induced by tiny

intramolecular hyperﬁne interactions and interruption of this mixing by collisions. This

speciﬁc type of relaxation was proposed to refer to as quantum relaxation. It is essential for

the physics of molecular spin isomers to understand which processes are responsible for the

spin conversion in other molecules.

Recently ﬁrst separation of nuclear spin isomers of ethylene molecules (13CCH4) has

been performed [7]. The conversion rate has been determined and it was shown that the
rate increases proportional to the gas pressure, γ/P ≃ 5 · 10−4 s−1/Torr. An understanding
of mechanism of the conversion in ethylene needs theoretical investigation of the process.

In the present paper we perform ﬁrst theoretical analysis of the spin conversion in ethy-

lene molecules. The purpose is to verify the consistency of the experimental data on isomer

conversion in ethylene with the conversion by quantum relaxation. We consider the same

isotope species, 13CCH4, for which the experiment was done [7]. An essential diﬀerence of

the present study from the well-understood case of CH3F molecules is that now we have to

work with an asymmetric-top molecule. This appeared to be much more complicated than

the case of symmetric-top molecules. We would like to point out that spin conversion in

2

asymmetric tops were considered theoretically previously for the CH2O and H20 molecules

[8].

II. ISOMER CONVERSION BY QUANTUM RELAXATION

Although the spin conversion in molecules by quantum relaxation is explained in other

publications we will describe brieﬂy its essence here for the convenience of the reader. At

room temperature almost all molecules are situated in their ground electronic and vibrational

states. Suppose that these states are separated into two subspaces which are the nuclear spin

ortho and para states, as is shown in Fig. 1 for the particular case of the 13CCH4 molecules.

Note that some molecules may have more than two nuclear spin isomer forms, e.g., methane,

or normal ethylene. On the other hand, number of molecules, e.g., H2, CH3F, and 13CCH4

too, have just two type of spin species.

The relaxation process which we are going to consider has two main ingredients. First,

the ortho and para quantum states of the test molecules are not completely independent.
There is small intramolecular perturbation, ˆV , which is able to mix the ortho and para

states. This perturbation can mix, in general, many ortho-para level pairs. But in Fig. 1

the mixing is present just for one pair of states as will be the case for 13CCH4, see below.

Second, the test molecules are embedded into an environment which is able to induce fast

relaxation inside the ortho, or para subspace, but is not able to produce direct transitions
between these subspaces. This implies that the relevant cross-section, σ(ortho|para) = 0.
The relaxation by direct transitions is the process opposite to the quantum relaxation.

The isomer conversion by quantum relaxation consists in the following. Suppose that at

the instant t = 0 a test molecule is placed into the ortho subspace. Due to collisions with

surrounding particles, the test molecule starts to perform fast migration along rotational

states inside the ortho subspace. This is the familiar rotational relaxation. This running

up and down along the ladder of the ortho states continues until the molecule jumps in the

state α which is mixed by an intramolecular perturbation with the energetically close para

state α′. During the free ﬂight after this collision, para state α′ will be admixed to the ortho

state α. Consequently, the next collision can transfer the molecule in other para states and

thus localizes it inside the para subspace. Such a mechanism of spin isomers conversion was

proposed in the theoretical work by Curl et al [8] (see also [9]).

3

The quantum relaxation of spin isomers can be quantitatively described in the framework

of the kinetic equation for density matrix [9]. One needs to split the molecular Hamiltonian

into two parts

ˆH = ˆH0 + ˆV ,

(1)

where the main part of the Hamiltonian, ˆH0, has pure ortho and para states as the eigen-
states; the perturbation ˆV mixes the ortho and para states. If at initial instant the nonequi-

librium concentration of, say, ortho molecules δρo(t = 0) was created, the system will relax

then exponentially, δρo(t) = δρo(0)e−γt, with the rate

γ = Xa′∈p,a∈o

2ΓF (a′|a)
Γ2 + ω2

a′a

(Wp(α′) + Wo(α)) ; F (a′|a) ≡ Xν ′∈p,ν∈o|Vα′α|2.

(2)

The sets of quantum numbers α′ ≡ {a′, ν′} and α ≡ {a, ν} consist of the degenerate quantum
numbers ν′, ν and the quantum numbers a′, a which determine the energy of the states. In
(2) Γ is the decay rate of the oﬀ-diagonal density matrix element ρα′α (α′ ∈ para; α ∈ ortho)
assumed here to be equal for all ortho-para level pairs; ωa′a is the gap between the states

a′ and a; Wp(α′) and Wo(α) are the Boltzmann factors of the corresponding states. For
the following it is convenient to introduce the strength of mixing, F (a′|a), which sums the
intramolecular couplings over all degenerate states.

III. ROTATIONAL STATES OF ETHYLENE

Ethylene is a popular object in high resolution infrared spectroscopy. This fortunate

circumstance made available rather accurate data on molecular parameters and position of

molecular rotational levels. The molecular structure, numbering of hydrogen atoms and

orientation of molecular system of coordinates are presented in Fig. 2. 13CCH4 is a plane,

prolate, nearly symmetric top having the symmetry point group C2v. The characters of the

group operations and the irreducible representations are given in the Table 1. We give in the

Table 1 also two isomorphic groups, molecular symmetry group C2v(M) [10] and the point

group D2. The bond lengths and angles which were used in our calculation are as follows:
rCH = 1.087 ˚A, rCC = 1.339 ˚A, the angle αHCH=117.40 [11].

The fact that the ethylene molecule is an asymmetric top complicates in two aspect the

theoretical analysis of the isomer conversion. First, the energy levels and wave functions

4

for asymmetric tops can be found only numerically but not analytically as is possible for

symmetric-top molecules. Second, the rotational quantum number k (projection of molecular

angular momentum on the molecular symmetry axis) becomes an approximate quantum

number in asymmetric tops. Consequently, one should calculate numerically more ortho-

para matrix elements than in the conversion of symmetric-top molecules, see, e.g., [9].

Rotational states of 13CCH4 can be determined using the Hamiltonian of Watson [12]

and the set of molecular parameters from Refs. [13,14]. The rotational Hamiltonian up to

sextic order terms has the form [12]

ˆH0 =

(3)

where J, Jx, Jy, and Jz are the molecular angular momentum operator and its projections on

the molecular axes. The B, C, and A are the parameters of a rigid top which characterize the

rotation around x, y, and z molecular axes, respectively (see, Fig. 2). The rest of parameters

account for the centrifugal distortion eﬀects [12]. In Eq. (3) the notation was used

Fn ≡ J n

z (J 2

x − J 2

y ) + (J 2

x − J 2

y )J n
z .

(4)

The Hamiltonian (3) can be diagonalized for each value of J and M in the basis of
the symmetric-top quantum states |J, k, M > (−J ≤ k ≤ J), where J, k and M are the
quantum numbers of the angular momentum, its projection on the molecular symmetry axis

and on the laboratory quantization axis, respectively. The Hamiltonian (3) has diagonal
in k matrix elements due to the ﬁrst two lines and matrix elements having |∆k| = 2. The
calculations of the rotational eigen states can be simpliﬁed if one uses the Wang basis [15]
with K = |k|:

|α, p > =

|α0, p > =

1

√2 h|α > +(−1)J+K+p|α >i ; 0 < K ≤ J,
1 + (−1)J+p

|α0 >; K = 0.

2

(5)

Here p = 0, 1 and the sets of quantum numbers are α ≡ {J, K, M}; |α >≡ {J,−K, M}; α0 ≡
{J, K = 0, M}. Depending on the parity of J, K and p, the states (5) generate 4 diﬀerent
irreducible representations of the molecular symmetry group D2 (Table 1). The molecular

5

Hamiltonian is full symmetric (symmetry A1). Consequently, the matrix elements between

the states of diﬀerent symmetry disappear. Thus diagonalization of the total Hamiltonian in

the basis of (5) is reduced to the diagonalization of four independent submatrices, each for

the states of particular symmetry. The rotational states of asymmetric top can be expanded

over the basis states (5)

|β, p >= XK

AK|α, p >,

(6)

where AK stands for the expansion coeﬃcients. The summation index, K, is given explicitly

in (6), although AK depends on the other quantum numbers as well. All coeﬃcients in

the expansion (6) are real numbers because the Hamiltonian (3) is symmetric in the basis
|α, p >.

There are a few schemes for practical classiﬁcation of the rotational states of asymmetric

tops [16]. In this paper we will use the scheme which is somewhat better adapted to the

description of nuclear spin isomers. We will designate the rotational states of asymmetric

top by indicating p, J and prescribing the allowed K values to the eigenstates keeping both

in ascending order. For example, the eigenstate having p = 0, J = 20, being the third in
ascending order will be designated by K = 4, because the allowed K in the expansion (6)
are K = 0, 2, 4 . . .20. (Note the diﬀerence between the two characters K and K). It gives
unambiguous notation of rotational states for each of the four species A1, A2 (K-even) and
B1, B2 (K-odd). This classiﬁcation establishes the connection with the prolate symmetric
top for which K = K. One should remember that physical meaning of the quantum number
K is clearly limited. To illustrate this we consider as an example the rotational states of A1
and A2 symmetry (K-even) for J = 20. The upper panel in Fig. 3 shows that the energy of
the rotational states is not determined solely by K as it would be for a rigid symmetric top.
The graph shows the diﬀerence in energy between rotational states A1 and A2 having the
same K-number but diﬀerent quantum numbers p. The states A1, K = 0 and A2, K = 0 are
omitted from the graph because the latter state does not exist. As it is seen from the data
the splitting is signiﬁcant for low values of K and rapidly disappears as K increases. Note,
that the A1 and A2 states for a rigid symmetric-top molecule would be degenerate for all K.
The low panel in Fig. 3 illustrates the property of the eigen state expansions over the basis

states (5). In this panel the squared magnitude of the two AK coeﬃcients in each eigenstate
of the symmetry A1 (J = 20) is given. The ﬁrst one (”K-term” in the Fig. 3) is A2

K having

6

K = K. These coeﬃcients appeared to be the biggest coeﬃcients in each expansion. This
adds some physical insight to the proposed classiﬁcation scheme. The ”second term” is the
second biggest coeﬃcient in the expansion. Again, at low K values there are more than one
signiﬁcant terms in the expansion (6). As K grows, the contribution from just one term
becomes predominant. Note that the same graph for a symmetric-top molecule would show

only one signiﬁcant term, AK=K, in the expansions of all eigenstates.

IV. ORTHO AND PARA ISOMERS OF ETHYLENE

The total molecular wave function is a product of spatial wave function and spin wave

function. The nuclear spin states in 13CCH4 are of A1 and B1 species, having the statistical

weights 20 and 12, respectively. The ortho spin states (symmetry A1) have the two hydrogen

pairs (H1-H2 and H3-H4) either both in triplet state, or both in singlet state. The para

species (symmetry B1) have one pair of protons in singlet state but the other pair in triplet

state. Each symmetry operation of the C2v group interchange in 13CCH4 even number of

protons. Consequently, the total wave function must be unchanged under all operations,

thus belonging to the representation A1. In order to have the total wave function being of

species A1 one has to have the spatial wave function being of symmetry A1 and B1 as the

spin wave functions are. This implies that the rotational states A1 and B1 should be only

positive (even in parity) but the rotational states A2 and B2 should be only negative (odd

in parity).

Summarizing this discussion we can write the total states in the 13CCH4 molecules. The

ortho states can be presented as

|µ >= |β, p > |i12, i34, iC >;

i12, i34 = t, s; K − even.

(7)

Here i12, i34, and iC designate the spin states of the two pairs of protons and the nucleus

13C (Fig. 2). For ortho molecules the spin states of the proton pairs should be either both
triplet, |t, t >, or both singlet states, |s, s >.

The para states can be presented as

|µ′ >= |β′, p′ > |i′

C >; K′ − odd.

12, i′

34, i′

(8)

For para molecules one pair of proton is in singlet, but the other in triplet state, thus
the proton spin states are |t′, s′ >, or |s′, t′ >.
7

In (7), (8) and further we use unprimed

parameters for ortho species and primed parameters for para species; p = 0, 1 indicates

positive, or negative sign of the state, respectively. Eqs. (7), (8) imply that the ortho-para
state mixing in ethylene needs coupling of states having diﬀerent parity of K.

The relative position of ortho and para states is important for the calculation of the

conversion rate (see Eq. (2)). In the case of a symmetric-top molecule the ortho-para energy

gaps can be expressed as a polynomial of J and K. This gives “accidental” (isolated)

resonances between the ortho and para states in symmetric top. In the case of an asymmetric

top one has a phenomenon which can be called collapse of ortho and para states. It appears as

a progressive decrease of the ortho-para energy gaps between the states of identical rotational

momenta, J, as J increases. This is illustrated in Fig. 4, which shows the gaps between the
13CCH4 ortho states, K = 0, and the para states, K′ = 1, both having positive sign (p = 0)
and the same J. If such sequence of ortho-para level pairs would exist for symmetric tops it

would dominate the conversion. In the case of asymmetric tops the situation is diﬀerent. We

will see below that this sequence of closed ortho-para level pairs do not produce a signiﬁcant

contribution to the isomer conversion in 13CCH4.

The Boltzmann factors Wo(α) and Wp(α′) in Eq. (2) determines the relative population

of rotational states in the ortho and para families,

ρα = ρoWo(α); ρα′ = ρpWp(α′),

(9)

where ρo and ρp are the total densities of ortho and para molecules, respectively. The Eqs. (9)

imply the equilibrium distributions inside the ortho and para subspaces. This is fulﬁlled with

high accuracy even if the ratio ρo/ρp is out of equilibrium because rotational relaxation is

on many orders of magnitude faster than the ortho-para conversion. The partition functions

for ortho and para molecules at room temperature (T=295 K) are found to be equal to

Zortho = 2.66 · 104; Zpara = 1.60 · 104.

(10)

In the calculation of these partition functions we took into account the degeneracy over M,

nuclear spins, including also spin of nucleus 13C, parity of states, as well as the restrictions

imposed by quantum statistics.

V. ORTHO-PARA STATE MIXING

In the present paper we will consider the ortho-para conversion induced by the two

hyperﬁne interactions, viz., magnetic dipole-dipole interaction between the molecular nuclei
(spin-spin interaction, ˆVSS) and the nuclear spin-rotation interaction, ˆVSR. Thus the total

intramolecular perturbation able to mix the ortho and para states is

ˆV = ˆVSS + ˆVSR.

(11)

All matrix elements of ˆV are diagonal in parity p.

A. Nuclear spin-spin coupling

The ortho-para conversion in molecules induced by nuclear spin-spin coupling were in-

vestigated in [8,9] (other references see in the review [17]). The spin-spin Hamiltonian for

the two magnetic dipoles µ1 and µ2 separated by the distance r has the form [15]

ˆV12 = P12T(12) •

•

ˆI(1)ˆI(2) ;

T (12)
ij = δij − 3ninj ;

P12 = µ1µ2/r3I (1)I (2)h ,

(12)

where ˆI(1) and ˆI(2) are the spin operators of the particles 1 and 2, respectively; n is the unit

vector directed along r; i and j are the Cartesian indices. The second rank tensor T(12) in

the Eq. (12) represents a spatial part of the spin-spin interaction. The second rank tensor
ˆI(1)ˆI(2) acts on spin variables.

The total spin-spin interaction in 13CCH4 is composed from the interactions between all

pairs of molecular nuclei. One can show that the spin-spin interactions between the protons

1-3, 2-4, 1-2, and 3-4 have the spatial part which can mix the quantum states only if they

have K numbers of the same parity. Consequently, these terms do not contribute to the

ortho-para state mixing in ethylene. The complete nuclear spin-spin interaction in 13CCH4

able to mix the ortho and para states reads

VSS = V (14)

SS + V (23)

SS + V (C1)

SS + V (C2)

SS + V (C3)

SS + V (C4)
SS .

(13)

Here the upper indices refer to the hydrogen nuclei in the molecule 1. . . 4, and to the nucleus

13C, which has spin equal 1/2 (see Fig. 2). Calculation of the spin-spin matrix elements can

9

be simpliﬁed by a few observations which we discuss in more detail for the perturbations
V (14)
SS and V (23)

SS . First, one can proof by applying proper symmetry operation that:

< µ′|V (14)

SS |µ >=< µ′|V (23)

SS |µ > .

(14)

Next, the two, out of four, matrix elements between the ortho and para spin states vanish,

< t′, s′|V (14)

SS |s, s >=< s′, t′|V (14)

SS |s, s >= 0,

(15)

because in these two cases one has the matrix elements of a vector (spin operator) between

the states both having zero spin. On the other hand, the remaining two matrix elements

are equal to each other,

< t′, s′|V (14)

SS |t, t >=< s′, t′|V (14)

SS |t, t > .

(16)

V (14)

To summarize, one can conclude that the variety of matrix elements for the operators
SS |β, p, t, t >. Obvi-
ously, the carbon spin state, which is omitted in this expression for simplicity, should be

is reduced to one matrix element, e.g., < β′, p, t′, s′|V (14)

unchanged in this matrix element.

Further, we write this matrix element using an expansion over symmetric-top states (6)

This expression reduces the calculation of the spin-spin matrix elements in asymmetric tops

to the calculation of symmetric-top matrix elements. Solution for the latter can be found in
[9], which allows to express the strength of mixing in ethylene by ˆVSS as

mixing in ethylene read

∆p = 0;

|∆J| ≤ 2,

(20)

and in addition, parity of K′ and K is opposite.

B. Spin-rotation coupling

Ortho-para conversion in molecules induced by spin-rotation coupling were studied in

[8,19,20] (more references can be found in [17]). Nuclear spin-rotation coupling in molecules

is due to magnetic ﬁelds produced by the molecular electrical currents. The spin-rotation

perturbation can be presented as [21,16,20]

ˆVSR =

1

2  Xi

ˆI(i) • C(i) • ˆJ + h.c.! ;

i = 1, 2, 3, 4.

(21)

For the spin-rotation perturbation relevant to the ortho-para mixing, the index i should

refer only to the hydrogen nuclei.

The calculation of the second rank spin-rotation tensor C is rather complicated problem

which is not solved yet completely. We will use the following estimation of C. First we note

that contribution to the spin-rotation coupling arising from the electric ﬁelds in the molecule

has been shown to be very small compared to the part having “magnetic” origin and can

be neglected [22]. Then, we split the C-tensor arising from magnetic ﬁelds of the moving

charges into two parts,

C = eC + nC,

(22)

produced by the molecular electrons and nuclei, respectively. The nuclear contribution, nC,

is obtained as a ﬁrst order average in the vibrational ground state, and depends only on

the nuclear coordinates. Contrary, the electron part, eC, is a second order series expansion

which involves the full electronic spectrum. Fortunately, xz and zx components which are

responsible for the mixing of states having ∆K = 1 in C2H4 are vanishing by symmetry

requirements [20].

Therefore, the C-tensor, eﬀective in ortho-para conversion, can be written (in Hz) for

the i-th as [22]

11

C(i) = Xk6=i

bk [(rk • Rk)1 − rkRk] • B;

bk = 2µpqk/c¯hR3

k ,

(23)

where Rk is the radial vector from the proton H(i) to the charge k; rk is the radial from the

center of mass to the particle k; qk are the nuclei’ charges; B is the inverse matrix of inertia

moment. B is a diagonal matrix having the elements Bxx = 58.6 GHz, Byy = 48.7 GHz,

and Bzz = 291.9 GHz. Index k runs here over all nuclei in the molecule except the proton i.

The spherical components of the spin-rotation tensor of the rank l (l = 1, 2) for the i-th

proton calculated in the molecular frame, C(i)
ethylene molecular structure from the Ref. [18] and bare nuclei’ charges these components

l,q , can be determined using Eq. (23). For the

Similar to the previous section, one can reduce the calculation of the matrix elements

of the spin-rotation coupling in asymmetric tops to the calculation of the symmetric-top

matrix elements. The latter can be found in [19,20,23]. Thus one has the the strength of

mixing due to the spin-rotation coupling in ethylene,

And again, parity of K′ and K is opposite.

VI. CONVERSION RATES AND DISCUSSION

The decoherence rate, Γ, is another important parameter for the isomer conversion by

quantum relaxation (see Eq. (2)). This parameter is rather diﬃcult to calculate or to

measure. Due to its physical meaning the value of Γ is close to the rotational state population

decay, which determines the line broadening in microwave rotational spectra. Unfortunately,

the ethylene does not have pure rotational spectra because it has no permanent electric dipole

moment. Or, to be precise, very small dipole moment in the case of 13CCH4.

In the present calculations we take the estimation of Γ from the line broadening in

infrared spectra, for which the information is available. Recently the line broadening was

accurately measured for the C2H4 molecules embedded in nitrogen [24]. One should not

expect big diﬀerence for the line broadening in the isotope species C2H4 and 13CCH4. From

the data [24] one can estimate the decoherence rate as

Γ/P = 2 · 107 s−1/Torr.

(28)

This rate is 10 times smaller than the Γ determined for the isomer conversion in CH3F [17].

The decrease of Γ is because ethylene is not a polar molecule and thus has its rotational

relaxation slower. Probably, the estimation (28) is too low for the case of pure ethylene gas

because ethylene has polarizability larger than nitrogen. For the buﬀer gases having large

polarizability, like Kr, or SF6, nearly three times bigger line broadening was found [25].

Nevertheless, we will use the estimation (28) which can be considered as a low limit for Γ.

Now we are ready to calculate the conversion rate in ethylene. The ﬁnal expression
for the conversion rate, γ, is again the Eq. (2) having the strength of mixing, F (a′|a) =
FSS(a′|a) + FSR(a′|a). The results of the calculations are given in the Table 2. From these
data we note that there is no appreciable contribution to the conversion from the collapsing

ortho-para level pairs presented in Fig. 4. Another observation is that the contribution from

13

the mixing of states having |∆K| > 1 is also small. This is the consequence of the fact that
the ethylene molecule is rather close to a symmetric top. The main contributions to the
conversion come from just two level pairs, both having the same quantum numbers (J ′,K′)–
(J,K), but diﬀerent p. The most important ortho-para level pair (1,27,7)–(1,28,6) has the
frequency gap ≃1.0 GHz. This level pair is indicated in Fig. 1 from which one can see that
this pair of states is situated at rather high energies. Nearly 10% of the conversion rate is

due to the pair (0,27,7)–(0,28,6). This level pair has the same strength of mixing as the ﬁrst
pair but three times bigger level splitting, ω. The properties of the states (1, J = 28,K = 6)
and (1, J = 27,K = 7) are illustrated in Fig. 5 which presents the expansion coeﬃcients, AK,
for these states. One can note that the biggest coeﬃcient in both expansions has the value
of K equal to the value of K chosen for the designation of the eigenstate in our classiﬁcation
scheme.

The total conversion rate in 13CCH4 which is the sum over all ortho-para level pairs

having J ′ and J up to 40, was found equal

γ/P = 2.7 · 10−4 s−1/Torr.

(29)

This rate is close to the experimental value (5.2 ± 0.8) · 10−4 s−1/Torr [7].

The calculations of the conversion rates were repeated using less accurate molecular

parameters from [13]. We obtained essentially the same results. The conversion is again
determined by the same two level pairs and the value of the total conversion rate is 3.5 ·
10−4 s−1/Torr, which is close to the more precise value (29).

Our model allows to determine the pressure dependence of the conversion rate in 13CCH4

at the conditions of the experiment [7]. By comparing the level splitting of the most impor-
tant ortho-para level pair (1,27,7)–(1,28,6), which is ∼1.0 GHz, with the decoherence rate
(28) one can conclude that the case corresponds to the limit Γ ≪ ω. From Eq. (2) one
can see that in this limit linear grows of the conversion rate, γ, versus gas pressure should

take place. (Note that Γ is proportional to the gas pressure.) This dependence was indeed

observed in the experiment [7].

Magnitude of the calculated conversion rate relies heavily on the determination of the

ortho-para level splitting. The gap of the most important level pair appeared to be rather
large, ≃1.0 GHz, and is unlikely that it has been determined with signiﬁcant error. This can
be proven by comparing this splitting with the one calculated using less accurate molecular

14

parameters [13]. These parameters give the gap 0.914 GHz, which is close to the value given

in the Table 2.

The two sources of the ortho-para mixing have been analysed. The spin-spin interaction

between the molecular nuclei was possible to calculate rather accurately. The uncertainty of

this perturbation is mainly due to small errors in the knowledge of the molecular structure.

On the other hand, our analysis has shown that the spin-spin coupling contributes less

than 1% to the ethylene conversion and thus negligible. There are a few reasons for this

reduction. First, the spin-spin tensor has relatively small value due to the big distances

between interacting nuclei and small magnitude of the magnetic moment of the carbon

nucleus. Second, due to high symmetry of the molecular structure interactions between

many pairs of protons do not contribute to the ortho-para mixing. Moreover, there are

no close ortho-para level pairs at small J, where spin-spin coupling can compete with the

spin-rotation coupling.

We have taken into account also the spin-rotation perturbation. The magnitude of the

spin-rotation tensor was estimated and it was demonstrated that the main contribution

to the ethylene conversion comes from the spin-rotation mixing. Strong contribution from

the spin-rotation coupling is due to the fact that the strength of the mixing FSR grows

as J 3 in comparison with the slower (J 2) grows of the spin-spin strength of mixing FSS.

This makes the “accidental” resonance at big J (1,27,7)–(1,28,6) being so important. An

extra cause of the eﬃciency of the spin-rotation coupling is that the spin-rotation tensors

of ﬁrst and second rank contribute both to the conversion. On the other hand, not all close

ortho-para level pairs contribute to the conversion. In the particular case of the collapsing

ortho-para levels (Fig. 4) there is no strong mixing mainly because of interferences between

many symmetric-top components with diﬀerent quantum numbers K, and also because for

these J ′ = J pairs the ﬁrst rank spin-rotation tensor does not contribute.

Error in the estimation of Γ introduces systematic uncertainty into the ﬁnal result. But

it does not undermine the model as a whole. First, one can turn around the approach and

determine which decoherence rate Γ should be chosen in order to ﬁt the experimental data. In

order to reproduce the experimental rate of conversion one should take the decoherence rate,
Γ/P = 3.9 · 107 s−1/Torr, which is less than two times diﬀerent from our rough estimation
(28). Of course, such approach will be justiﬁed only when the spin-rotation perturbation

15

in ethylene will be known from an independent source. There is another point which is

worth to mention. Recently it was proposed a new approach to the isomer conversion in

which the knowledge of Γ is not necessary at all [26].

It is based on a fast linear sweep

of the molecular levels through the ortho-para resonance. Nuclear spin conversion in such

experimental arrangement does not depend on Γ and is dependent on the strength of ortho-

para mixing and the population of the mixed states.

Finally, it seems interesting to emphasize the diﬀerence in the conversion rates produced

by the two pairs of identical rotational quantum numbers (27,7)–(28,6) but diﬀerent in

parity. This peculiarity arises from the asymmetric top properties, where energy of states

depend on parity. This in turn has dynamical consequence that the spin isomers equilibrate

ﬁrst in one parity manifold (here the odd one).

VII. CONCLUSIONS

The theoretical model for the nuclear spin conversion in ethylene (13CCH4) has been

developed. For the ﬁrst time a theory of the spin isomer conversion in asymmetric tops was

possible to compare with experimental data on the isomer conversion. We have found that

the two experimental results [7]: the magnitude of the ethylene (13CCH4) isomer conversion

rate and its pressure dependence, are consistent with the spin conversion governed by quan-

tum relaxation. The ortho-para state mixing is performed in this molecule mainly by the

coupling between the protons’ spins and the molecular rotation. We have identiﬁed also the

two pairs of ortho-para states which are almost completely determine the spin conversion in

13CCH4

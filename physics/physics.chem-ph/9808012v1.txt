Abstract

The quartic force ﬁeld of SO3 was computed fully ab initio using coupled

cluster (CCSD(T)) methods and basis sets of up to spdf gh quality. The eﬀect

of inner-shell correlation was taken into account. The addition of tight d func-

tions is found to be essential for accurate geometries and harmonic frequen-

cies. The equilibrium geometry and vibrational fundamentals are reproduced

to within 0.0003 ˚A and (on average) 1.15 cm−1, respectively. We recom-

mend the following revised values for the harmonic frequencies: ω1=1082.7,

ω2=502.6, ω3=1415.4, ω4=534.0 cm−1. In addition, we have shown that the

addition of inner polarization functions to second-row elements is highly desir-

able even with more approximate methods like B3LYP, and greatly improves

the quality of computed geometries and harmonic frequencies of second-row

compounds at negligible extra computational cost. For larger such molecules,

the B3LYP/VTZ+1 level of theory should be a very good compromise between

accuracy and computational cost.

I. INTRODUCTION

The importance of the sulfuric anhydride (SO3) molecule in atmospheric and industrial

chemistry requires no further elaboration.

Experimental studies of its vibrational spectroscopy have to contend with a number of

problems such as the tendency of SO3 to polymerize, its very hygroscopic character, and its

easy decomposition in the gas phase to SO2. Possibly this explains why only a relatively

small body of rotation-vibration spectroscopy data is available.

The only available anharmonic force ﬁeld for this prototype planar XY3 molecule is the

work of Dorney, Hoy, and Mills [1] (DHM), who proposed two model force ﬁelds. Not enough

data are available for an experimental force ﬁeld reﬁnement.

In recent years, however, the methodology for computing anharmonic force ﬁelds fully ab

initio has developed to the point where the computed force ﬁelds are at least [2,3] suitable

starting material for further experimental reﬁnement [4–6] and at best deliver essentially

spectroscopic accuracy in their own right [7–10]. (By analogy with Boys’ concept of ‘chemical

accuracy’,

1 kcal/mol, for energetics, we will arbitrarily deﬁne ‘spectroscopic accuracy’ here

±

as

1 cm−1 on vibrational transition energies.)

±
Recently, the present author published a calibration study [11] on the anharmonic force

ﬁeld of sulfur dioxide. It was found there that the computed geometry and harmonic frequen-

cies were critically dependent on the presence of high-exponent ‘inner polarization functions’

in the basis set, whose contribution is actually much more important than that of inner-shell

correlation. (They also contribute as much as 8 kcal/mol to the total atomization energy

of SO2 [11,12]. This is an extreme version of a phenomenon that appears to occur more

generally in second-row compounds [13,14].) Our best computed force ﬁeld agreed to within

0.0004 ˚A and 0.03 degrees with experiment for the geometry: the errors in the fundamentals

of SO2 were +3.9, -0.4, and +0.4 cm−1. It would therefore appear that the same level of

theory would be suﬃcient to produce a reliable force ﬁeld for SO3 as well.

Some other recent ab initio anharmonic force ﬁeld calculations on planar XY3 systems

2

include the work of Botschwina and coworkers [15] on CF3 and CF+

3 , of Schwenke [16] on

CH3, of Green et al. [17] on SiH+

3 , of Martin and Lee [18] on BH3, and of Pak and Woods

[19] on BF3 and CF+
3 .

Previous ab initio studies of the vibrational force ﬁeld were limited to the harmonic

part (e.g. [20], which used scaled quantum mechanical (SQM) [21] techniques as well as

MCSCF calculations). To the author’s knowledge, this paper presents the ﬁrst accurate

anharmonic force ﬁeld for SO3 obtained by any method.

It will also be shown that the

harmonic frequencies derived from experiment by DHM need to be substantially revised.

II. METHODS

All electronic structure calculations were carried out using MOLPRO 96.4 [22] with the

tripu and scfpr0 patches [23] installed, or a prerelease version of MOLPRO 97.3 [24]

running on a DEC Alpha 500/500 workstation and an SGI Origin 2000 minisupercomputer

at the Weizmann Institute of Science.

As in our previous work on SO2 [11], the CCSD(T) electron correlation method [25,26],

as implemented by Hampel et al. [27], has been used throughout. The acronym stands for

coupled cluster with all single and double substitutions [28] augmented by a quasiperturba-

tive account for triple excitations [25]. From extensive studies (see [29] for a review) this

method is known to yield correlation energies very close to the exact n-particle solution

within the given basis set as long as the Hartree-Fock determinant is a reasonably good

zero-order reference wave function. From the value of the

T1 diagnostic [30] calculated for

SO3, 0.018, we see that this condition is deﬁnitely fulﬁlled.

Calculations including only valence correlation were carried out using correlation con-

sistent polarized n-tuple zeta (cc-pVnZ) basis sets of Dunning and coworkers [31,32]. For

sulfur/oxygen, the cc-pVTZ and cc-pVQZ basis sets correspond to (15s9p2d1f /10s5p2d1f )

and (16s11p3d2f 1g/12s6p3d2f 1g) primitive sets contracted to [5s4p2d1f /4s3p2d1f ] and

[6s5p3d2f 1g/5s4p3d2f 1g], respectively. Because of the strongly polar character of the SO

bonds, we have also considered the aug-cc-pVnZ basis sets [33,34], which consist of cc-pVnZ

3

basis sets with one low-exponent ‘anion’ function added to each angular momentum. In the

interest of brevity, the standard acronyms cc-pVnZ and aug′-cc-pVnZ will be replaced by

VnZ and AVnZ, respectively.

Furthermore, we considered the addition of a tight d function with exponent αD=3.203

[13] to the sulfur basis set; its presence is indicated by the notation VTZ+1, VQZ+1, and

the like.

As in our previous studies on SO and SO2 [11], H2SiO [14], and various second-row

diatomics [35,13], core correlation was included using the Martin-Taylor basis set [36,37].

This is generated by completely decontracting the cc-pVTZ basis set and adding a single high-

exponent p function and two even-tempered series, one of three tight d functions and another

of two tight f functions. The exponents are deﬁned as 3nα (rounded to the nearest integer

or half-integer), where α represents the highest exponent of that angular momentum already

present in the cc-pVTZ basis. Obviously, such a basis set already amply covers the ‘inner

polarization’ region as well. For brevity, CCSD(T)/Martin-Taylor calculations with only the

valence electrons correlated are denoted CCSD(T)/MTnocore, while in CCSD(T)/MTcore

calculations, all orbitals except for the sulfur (1s)-like orbital (which lies too deep to interact

appreciably with the valence shell) have been correlated.

Geometry optimizations were carried out by repeated multivariate parabolic interpolation

with a step size of 0.001 bohr or radian, and a convergence threshold of about 10−5 bohr

or radian. Quartic force ﬁelds were set up by ﬁnite diﬀerentiation in symmetry-adapted

coordinates

in which the ri are the SO bond distances, the θi are the OSO bond angles opposite the

corresponding ri, and δ represents the out-of-plane motion. In order to keep higher-order

contamination in the quartic portion of the force ﬁeld to a minimum, fairly small step sizes

0.01 ˚A and radian were used and CCSD(T) energies converged to essentially machine pre-

cision. Generation of the displaced Cartesian geometries and transformation of the internal

coordinate force ﬁeld to Cartesian coordinates were carried out with the help of the INTDER

[38] program. The anharmonic spectroscopic analysis was carried out by standard second-

order rovibrational perturbation theory using a modiﬁed version of SPECTRO [39,40]. No

Fermi resonances needed to be accounted for, but some of the rotation-vibration interaction

constants needed to be deperturbed for a Coriolis resonance ω2 ≈

ω4 around the b axis.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Computed and experimentally derived bond distances and harmonic frequencies are given

in Table I, while computed and observed fundamentals can be found in Table II.

High-resolution values are available for all fundamentals except ν1, for which the Bondy-

bey and English (BE) [41] value of 1068.6 cm−1 appears to be the most reliable one available.

ν3=1391.5205 cm−1 was taken from the work of Henfrey and Thrush (HT) [42]. The rota-

tional ﬁne structures of the ν2 and ν4 bands overlap as well as exhibit Coriolis resonance:
Kaldor et al. (KMDM) [43] resolved this spectrum to give ν2=497.55 and ν4=530.18 cm−1.

They also deﬁnitively refuted a suggestion by Thomas and Thompson (TT) [44] that the

assignments be reversed: the TT band origins (with the correct assignment) are ν2=498.5
and ν4=529.16 cm−1. A high-resolution study by Ortigoso, Escribano, and Maki (OEM)
[45] ﬁnally yielded ν2=497.5679(1) and ν4=530.0863(1) cm−1. In the process, OEM also ob-

tained improved values of the ground state rotational constants, and particularly a revised
re=1.41732 ˚A, which is near the lower limit of the earlier DHM value, re=1.4184±

0.0010 ˚A.

Comparing the observed with the calculated fundamentals, it is immediately seen that

the CCSD(T)/VTZ fundamentals leave a lot to be desired: errors with respect to the ex-

perimental values (BE,OEM,HT) are -25.1, -15.5, -20.4, and -16.1 cm−1, respectively, for

5

ν1, ν2, ν3, and ν4. Switching to a VTZ+1 basis set (i.e. adding the tight d function on S)

dramatically cuts these errors to -1.6, +1.0, +4.8, and -2.0 cm−1.

Turning to Table I, we see that in addition r(SO) is shortened by no less than 0.0116

˚A, thus cutting the discrepancy with experiment by more than half. Actually, the tight d

function appears to be even more important for the quality of the results than increasing

the basis set from VTZ to VQZ. Adding the inner polarization function to the VQZ basis

set has a smaller eﬀect than for the VTZ basis set (as it well should, since the VQZ basis

set contains tighter d functions than its VTZ counterpart), but still aﬀects the bond length

by -0.0050 ˚A. The main diﬀerence between the VTZ+1 and VQZ+1 harmonics is that ω3

drops by about 4.5 cm−1, removing the largest error remaining in the fundamentals at the

CCSD(T)/VTZ+1 level.

Given the strongly polar character of the S-O bonds in SO3, the addition of anion func-

tions is expected to have a nontrivial eﬀect. From VTZ+1 to AVTZ+1, the harmonics

are lowered by no less than -13.2, -5.7, -20.1, and -8.0 cm−1, respectively; from VQZ+1 to

AVQZ+1, the eﬀect is much weaker: -3.6, -2.4, -6.0, and -2.4 cm−1. While the addition of

diﬀuse functions lengthens r(SO) by +0.0030 ˚A between VTZ+1 and AVTZ+1, this likewise

becomes much less signiﬁcant from VQZ+1 to AVQZ+1 (+0.0009 ˚A).

Computing anharmonic corrections with these large basis sets for a four-heavy atom

molecule is beyond the presently available computational resources. However, it is seen

here that even from CCSD(T)/VTZ to CCSD(T)/VTZ+1, the basis set eﬀect on the anhar-

monic corrections is very modest (-0.10, -0.27, -0.07, and +0.01 cm−1), while for SO2 [11],

their basis set dependence was likewise found to be quite mild. We therefore opt for the

CCSD(T)/VTZ+1 anharmonicities and will merely substitute an improved bond distance

and improved harmonic frequencies in the analysis.

Doing the latter with the CCSD(T)/AVQZ+1 data yields harmonic frequencies which

are systematically too low, with re of course still being 0.0053 ˚A longer than experiment.

A complete CCSD(T)/MTcore harmonic frequency calculation proved too demanding

in terms of computational resources: what could be succesfully completed was a univariate

6

optimization of re, with ω1 being obtained as a by-product. The CCSD(T)/MTcore re falls

within the error bar of the DHM value and is just 0.00032 ˚A longer than the OEM value.

The contributions of inner-shell correlation to re and ω1 turn out to be much more modest

0.00283 ˚A, +4.2 cm−1) than those of inner polarization.

(

−

If we consider the ratios ωi(MTcore)/ωi(MTnocore) for ω1 and for the harmonic fre-

quencies of SO2, we ﬁnd that these ratios are remarkably similar: 1.0039, 1.0037, 1.0038,

and 1.0036. (They correspond almost exactly to [re(MTcore)/re(MTnocore)]2.) Under these

circumstances, we might be able to obtain ‘best estimate’ harmonic frequencies by scaling

the CCSD(T)/AVQZ+1 values by ω1(MTcore)/ω1(MTnocore) = 1.00386, which leads to the

following values: 1081.2, 503.1, 1415.1, and 531.6 cm−1.

We now substitute these harmonic frequencies and the CCSD(T)/MTcore geometry in

the spectroscopic analysis, and thus obtain the fundamentals labeled ‘best’ in Table II.

Compared to the (BE,OEM,HT) set of experimental values, the remaining discrepancies

are -1.5, +0.4, -0.3, and -2.4 cm−1, or 1.15 cm−1 on average. We can thus safely claim

‘spectroscopic accuracy’ for our best force ﬁeld.

Turning now to the rotational constants (Table III), we see that the computed and ex-

perimentally derived (OEM) Be agree to -0.02 %: Ce brings no additional information since

it is ﬁxed by the planarity relation Ce = Be/2. From our computed rotational constants we

can however now determine computed B0 and C0, which likewise turn out to be in excellent

agreement with the observed values:

-0.06 % and -0.03 %, respectively.

(B0 and C0 are

independent data because of the inertial defect.) The fact that the rotational constants are

consistently computed slightly too small is consistent with our bond distance being slightly

longer than the true value. From the relationship (in this case) r0 = reqBe/B0, we ﬁnd
r0(calc.)=1.42004 ˚A, compared to an experimental [46] value r0(obs.)=1.4198

0.0002 ˚A,

±

and one derived from the OEM B0 of 1.41963 ˚A. The discrepancy of +0.0004 ˚A between the

computed and OEM-derived r0 is consistent with the discrepancy of +0.0003 ˚A between the

computed and OEM re values. Aside from the observation that this would be considered

excellent agreement between theory and experiment by any reasonable standard, this sug-

7

gests that the OEM equilibrium bond distance of 1.41732 ˚A would be accurate to 0.0001 ˚A

or better. The computed rg (electron diﬀraction) distance from our force ﬁeld, 1.42275 ˚A,

is substantially longer than the experimental electron diﬀraction result [47], 1.4188

0.003

±

˚A. Since this latter study also ﬁnds an unrealistically short re=1.4142 and rz=1.4169 ˚A(our

own computed rz=1.42143 ˚A), we can safely conclude that the electron diﬀraction result is

in error. (For a review of the diﬀerent types of bond distances discussed, see Ref. [48].)

Our best harmonic frequencies agree relatively well with those obtained by DHM from

the experimental fundamentals and a valence model for anharmonicity, except for ω1 which

still is about 16 cm−1 too low in the better of their two models.

(The discrepancies for

ω3 and ω4 are still substantially bigger than the diﬀerences between the computed and

observed fundamentals, and it can safely be stated that the present ab initio values are

considerably more reliable than the experimentally derived ones.) It thus comes as no surprise

that the anharmonicity constants (Table IV) obtained by DHM from their valence models

(particularly ω1−
set, which clearly is the more reliable one.

ν1, which has the wrong sign) diﬀer profoundly from the presently computed

in Table I.

Coriolis and rotation-vibration coupling constants can be found in Table IV. The com-
24 is found as 0.1764 cm−1 from our best force ﬁeld,

puted Coriolis coupling constant Beζ B

which agrees reasonably, but not very, well with the OEM ‘Fit I’ value of 0.191694(460)

cm−1. They note that their ﬁt exhibits very strong dependency between Beζ B

24 and such

parameters as the rotational l-doubling constant q4 and the rovibrational coupling constants

α2B and α4B. Upon constraining Beζ B

24 to the force-ﬁeld derived value of 0.1801, they found

(Fit II in their paper) that all the abovementioned constants change drastically. It is note-

worthy that our computed α2B=0.00031, α4B=-0.00050, and q4=0.00063 cm−1 agree much
better with the ‘Fit II’ values of 0.000150, -0.000404, and 0.000497 cm−1, respectively, than

8

with the ‘Fit I’ values of -0.000381, -0.000140, and -0.000047 cm−1, respectively. Linear ex-

trapolation suggests that much of the residual discrepancies between our computed and the

‘Fit II’ would disappear if our Beζ B

24 value had been substituted in the experimental analysis.

OEM also obtained α2C and α4C values, which are in excellent agreement with our calcu-

lations, as are the α3B and α3C values of HT. Our computed α1B and α1C are larger than the

model-derived values of DHM, which appear to be on the low side for all other constants as

well. The centrifugal distortion constants are quite small, and agree with the experimental

values of OEM to within the latter’s uncertainties.

The trends in the computed quadratic force constants (Table V) closely parallel those

in the harmonic frequencies. (The most striking diﬀerence with the DHM quadratic force

constants, which reproduce the fundamentals rather than either of their sets of harmonic

frequencies, lies in the stretch-bend coupling constant F34.)

In order to stimulate further research on the vibrational spectrum of SO3, the symmetry-

unique cubic and quartic force constants in symmetry coordinates have been made available

in Table VI. The force ﬁelds in Cartesian, symmetry, and normal coordinates can also be

downloaded in machine-readable form on the World Wide Web at the Uniform Resource

Locator (URL) http://theochem.weizmann.ac.il/web/Papers/so3.html

IV. A NOTE ON LOWER-LEVEL CALCULATIONS

Some readers might wonder how well less computationally intensive methods would do

for the mechanical properties of SO3 and the other sulfur oxides, and whether the presence

of the tight d functions is still relevant at that accuracy level.

In order to answer these questions, we have carried out geometry optimizations and

harmonic frequency calculations for SO, SO2, and SO3 using the popular B3LYP density

functional method [49,50] as implemented in GAUSSIAN 94 [51]. The VTZ, VTZ+1, and

AVTZ+1 basis sets were considered, as was the popular 6-31+G* basis set. The results are

summarized in Table VII.

It is immediately seen that the 6-31+G* basis set systematically overestimates bond

9

lengths by no less than 0.035 ˚A, and (largely as a result thereof) underestimates stretching

frequencies by as much as 80 cm−1 and the SO3 out-of-plane bending frequency by about 50
cm−1. These errors are substantially reduced by using the VTZ basis set. However, at very

small additional expense, the addition of a tight d function on S leads to quite respectable

agreement with experiment: residual errors for the B3LYP/VTZ+1 harmonic frequencies are

+5.7 cm−1 in SO,

+0.4,+16.2,+6.5
}

{

cm−1 in SO2, and

-5.7,-8.4,-10.5,-6.4
}

{

cm−1 in SO3.

Trends in the eﬀect of the tight d function closely parallel those seen at the CCSD(T) level,

which is not surprising since it is essentially an SCF rather than a dynamical correlation

At the B3LYP/VTZ+1 level, all bond lengths are now within +0.006–0.008 ˚A of experi-

ment, and the OSO angle is in excellent agreement with experiment. Overall, performance

with the VTZ+1 basis set is as good as we can reasonably hope to get (e.g. [52]) at the

eﬀect. [11,13]

B3LYP level.

It is therefore clear that the addition of tight d functions to the basis set is eminently

worthwhile even for less than ‘benchmark quality’ calculations on second-row compounds, as

well as that B3LYP/VTZ+1 would represent an excellent compromise between accuracy and

computational cost for geometry and frequency calculations on larger second-row systems.

V. CONCLUSIONS

The ﬁrst-ever accurate anharmonic force ﬁeld for SO3 has been obtained fully ab initio.

We have been able to establish that:

re is reproduced to within +0.0003 ˚A, and the fundamentals to within 1.15 cm−1, on

like for SO2 and (to a lesser extent) for second-row compounds in general, the addition

of tight d functions (‘inner polarization functions’) to the basis set is essential for

average;

•

•

accurate results;

10

the following revised values are recommended values for the harmonic frequencies:

ω1=1082.7, ω2=502.6, ω3=1415.4, ω4=534.0 cm−1;

our computed rovibrational coupling, rotational l-doubling, and Coriolis coupling con-

stants suggest a preference for the set of constants in ‘Fit II’ in Ref. [45] (OEM) over

•

•

those in ‘Fit I’.

In addition, we have shown that the addition of inner polarization functions to second-

row elements is highly desirable even with more approximate methods like B3LYP, and

greatly improves the quality of computed geometries and harmonic frequencies of second-

row compounds at negligible extra computational cost. For larger such molecules, the

B3LYP/VTZ+1 level of theory should be a very good compromise between expense and

accuracy.

patch is required to permit suﬃciently tight SCF convergence criteria to guarantee an

accuracy of 12 decimal places in the CCSD and CCSD(T) energies.

Abstract

An adaptive, kink-based path integral formalism is used to calculate the ground state energies of

the atoms He-Ne. The method uses an adaptive scheme to virtually eliminate the sign diﬃculties.

This is done by using a Monte Carlo scheme to identify states that contribute signiﬁcantly to the

canonical partition function and then include them in the wavefunctions to calculate the canonical

averages. The calculations use the 6-31G basis set and obtain both precision and accuracy.

INTRODUCTION

The path integral formulation of quantum mechanics oﬀers a variety of advantages for

studying the electronic and geometric structures of multi-electron systems[1]. Chief among

these are inclusion of ﬁnite temperatures (particularly as they aﬀect geometric degrees of

freedom) and exact inclusion of electron-electron correlation. The application of this method

to electronic systems has been hindered by the so-called ”sign” problem, which results

from sign of the fermion density matrix, which can be positive or negative and leads to

large uncertainties in quantities evaluated using statistical methods such as Monte Carlo

simulations[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]. We have re-

cently introduced a ”kink-based” path integral approach[19], which was demonstrated to

overcome the sign problem in the 2-D Hubbard model. This approach is complimentary

to the shifted-contour auxiliary-ﬁeld Monte Carlo method[15, 16, 17, 18], which uses the

Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation to combat the sign problem.

In this work, we use

the kink-based formalism to study atomic systems, the next step in studying systems with

geometric degrees of freedom (such as atomic clusters).

II. KINK-BASED APPROACH

In this section, a brief review of the kink-based approach[19] is given, with additional

attention given to the diﬀerent spin states that are encountered in electronic systems. The

partition function is written:

where α labels the diﬀerent electronic states associated with a particular spin state σ and

| α, σ > is the properly anti-symmetrized state. For large enough β, this becomes

(1)

(2)

Q = T r{exp(−βH)}

< α, σ| exp(−βH)| α, σ >

exp(−βEα,σ)

=

σ,α

Q ≈ exp(−βE0,σ∗)

where E0,σ∗ is the ground state energy of the lowest energy spin-state. If an approximate

set of states, {a, s} is used, we have

Q{a,s} =

< a, s| exp(−βH)| a, s >

a,s
X

=

| < a, s|α, σ > |2 exp(−βEα,σ)

a,s
X
As long as < a, s|0, σ∗ > 6= 0 for some a and s, then as β gets large,

σ,α
X

Q{a,s} ∝ exp(−βE0,σ∗)

In a later section, we will choose our states with speciﬁc values of Sz. Consequently, we

will determine the low temperature partition function corresponding to the lowest energy
spin-state S that has Sz as one of its possible values of ˆSz.

To evaluate the partition function Q{a,s} using the path integral method, we insert com-

plete sets of states in order to use the high temperature, semi-classical approximation for

the density matrix:

We refer to a matrix element < a, s| exp(−βH/P )|a′, s′ > with a 6= a′ or s 6= s′ as a kink.

We rewrite the partition function as a sum over kinks:

Q{a,s} =

version of the path integral problem because any of the matrix elements ti,i+1 can be nega-

tive, resulting in a large variances when evaluating the partition function using simulation

methods. Our approach to minimizing or eliminating the sign problem has been to apply

Eqn. 9 in an adaptive manner. We ﬁrst realize that the zero kink contribution to Q has no

sign problems, since the system is in a single state. With a properly chosen states, Q can be

obtained with just a few kinks; this signiﬁcantly reduces the sign problem by reducing the

statistical error from greater than 100% to a precision adequate for chemical applications.

A good choice for the states is obtained using a Monte Carlo simulation, in which the dif-

ferent N-electron states that appear during the simulation are used to update the estimates

of the ground and excited states. We call this approach an adaptive approach, since the

Monte Carlo algorithm allows the estimates for the ground and excited state wavefunctions

to evolve according to the statistical sampling of the diﬀerent N-electron states.

We implemented the adaptive scheme in the following way (other methods of are possible).

An initial set of basis functions (the 6-31G basis set in our calculations) was orthonormal-

ized and used to create a set of one-electron orbitals. The one-electron Hamiltonian was

then diagonalized in this basis. Each electron was assigned a spin and the one-electron basis

functions were combined to form a set of Slater determinants (as described earlier, the low-

est energy spin state will be projected out by the path integral procedure) that were then

used as the initial |α, s > for the Monte Carlo simulation. A simulation using the absolute

value of the summand in Eqn. 9 as the weighting function was performed in which kinks

were added, removed, and changed. An upper limit on the number of kinks allowed was set

to 10 kinks; since the ﬁnal results were obtained with 0 or 2 kinks, this did not aﬀect the

accuracy of our results. A list of the states accepted was kept. If the fraction of conﬁgura-

tions that contained more than 0 kinks was greater than the fraction of conﬁgurations that

had 0 kinks, the Hamiltonian was diagonalized using the current list of states and a new

set of N-electron states obtained. These new diagonalized states were linear combinations

of the initial set of Slater orbitals and thus corresponded to conﬁguration interaction (CI)

wavefunctions. Since the simulation sums over all possible states, in essence a complete CI

calculation is performed. Another possible Monte Carlo scheme would allow the individual

Slater determinants to be altered during the simulation, which would correspond to a MC-

SCF calculation. At most 100 states were included in the diagonalization to limit the time

per diagonalization. If the set of accepted states exceeded 100 at the time of diagonalization,

5

only the 100 most prevalent states were included. Once 5000 iterations had occurred with

no diagonalizations, the run was terminated and these ﬁnal 5000 energies used to determine

energies. At the end of the calculation, the ground state would correspond to a high quality

CI ground state; if the state does not correspond to the complete CI wavefunction, then

kinks will be added to correct the ground state. If the adaptive procedure provides the com-

plete CI wavefunction, then no kinks would ever be introduced, as the density matrix would

be diagonal. In practical calculations, we expect to stop the adaptive process before the

density matrix is actually diagonal, but when the oﬀ-diagonal matrix elements are so small

that the likelihood of adding more than 2 kinks is very small. In fact, in our calculations,

the Monte Carlo procedure provided such a good estimate of the true ground state that at

any time we found only 0 kinks or 2 kinks (to one of the excited states).

III. APPLICATION TO ATOMIC ENERGIES

We have tested this approach by applying it to atomic systems, using the 6-31G basis

set. This set was chosen for its relative simplicity and reasonable accuracy. For each atom,

He-Ne, each electron was assigned a speciﬁc sz, leading to a ﬁxed total Sz. Thus, the sum

in Eqn. 5 used just a single spin state which was a linear combination of states S such that
Sz was one of the possible values of ˆSz. The initial basis functions were orthonormalized

and the one-particle Hamiltonian was diagonalized, providing an initial set of states. As

the Monte Carlo simulation was performed and diagonalizations proceeded as previously

described. Our results are shown in Table I, along with the Hartree-Fock and CASSCF

energies from Gaussian 98[20]. The average sign of the density matrix demonstrates that

the adaptive approach adequately reduces sign problem to well below what is needed for

chemical accuracy. For comparison, we note that a shifted-contour auxiliary-ﬁeld Monte

Carlo calculation of Ne[16], using a 4-31G basis set, led to errors of 0.004 a.u., signiﬁcantly

larger than those found in the present calculations. For illustrative purposes, Table II shows

the evolution of the coeﬃcients of the Slater determinants that contribute signiﬁcantly to

the ground state wavefunction of Be, during the ﬁrst 4 updates. After the ﬁrst 4 updates,

only minor changes occurred in the ground state. It can be seen that the adaptive procedure

introduces mixing between the Slater determinants as needed. The degeneracies seen can

be rationalized on the basis of symmetry.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

The adaptive, kink-based approach to path integral calculations has been applied to

atomic systems. As was the case in our previous work, the use of the adaptive approach

reduced the sign problem to a tolerable level. While we have used an adaptive diagonalization

7

procedure to improve our estimates for the electronic states, this is not an essential ingredient

in the adaptive approach. For instance, unitary transformations can be sampled as part of

the Monte Carlo process. In addition, we have not made any simplifying assumptions that

will be required when treating systems with large numbers of basis functions, such as limiting

the type of determinant that can contribute to the ground state wavefunction. We note that

the number of electrons and basis functions used in this study is on the order of that needed

to study moderately large metal clusters. For example, Na20 would require roughly 10 shell-

orbitals (orbitals centered at the origin of the cluster, in accord with the shell model of the

electronic structure) and 20 electrons, if pseudopotentials are used for the core electrons.

Thus, the current method may be applicable to moderately large systems.

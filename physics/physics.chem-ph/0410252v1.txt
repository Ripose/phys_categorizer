Theory of the singlet exciton yield in light-emitting polymers

The internal electroluminescent quantum eﬃciency of organic light emitting diodes is largely deter-
mined by the yield of singlet excitons formed by the recombination of the injected electrons and holes.
Many recent experiments indicate that in conjugated polymer devices this yield exceeds the statisti-
cal limit of 25% expected when the recombination is spin-independent. This paper presents a possible
explanation for these results. We propose a theory of electron-hole recombination via inter-molecular
inter-conversion from inter-molecular weakly bound polaron pairs (or charge-transfer excitons) to
intra-molecular excitons. This theory is applicable to parallel polymer chains. A crucial aspect of
the theory is that both the intra-molecular and inter-molecular excitons are eﬀective-particles, which
are described by both a relative-particle wavefunction and a center-of-mass wavefunction. This im-
plies two electronic selection rules. (1) The parity of the relative-particle wavefunction implies that
inter-conversion occurs from the even parity inter-molecular charge-transfer excitons to the strongly
bound intra-molecular excitons. (2) The orthonormality of the center-of-mass wavefunctions ensures
that inter-conversion occurs from the charge-transfer excitons to the lowest branch of the strongly
bound exciton families, and not to higher lying members of these families. The inter-conversion is
then predominately a multi-phonon process, determined by the Franck-Condon factors. These fac-
tors are exponentially smaller for the triplet manifold than the singlet manifold because of the large
exchange energy. As a consequence, the inter-conversion rate in the triplet manifold is signiﬁcantly
smaller than that of the singlet manifold, and indeed it is comparable to the inter-system crossing
rate. Thus, it is possible for the singlet exciton yield in conjugated polymers to be considerably
enhanced over the spin-independent recombination value of 25%

I.

INTRODUCTION

The internal electroluminescent quantum eﬃciency of organic light emitting diodes is largely determined by the
yield of singlet excitons formed by the recombination of the injected electrons and holes. Singlet exciton yields in light
emitting polymers exceeding the spin-independent recombination value of 25% have now been reported by a large
number of groups1-7, although its value remains controversial. Lin et al.8 claim that the singlet yield only exceeds
the statistical limit in large electric ﬁelds,9 while Segal et al.10 report a singlet exciton yield of only 20%. A photo-
luminescence detected magnetic resonance investigation11 suggests that inter-chain (or bimolecular) recombination is
spin-dependent.

Many theoretical attempts have been made to explain the enhanced singlet exciton yield. Bittner et al.12-14 assume
that intra-chain electron-hole recombination occurs via vibrational relaxation through the band of exciton states
between the particle-hole continuum and lowest bound excitons. Since vibrational relaxation is faster in the singlet
channel than the triplet channel, because the lowest singlet exciton lies higher in energy than the lowest triplet
exciton, a faster formation rate for the singlet than the triplet exciton is predicted. Hong and Meng15 argue that a
multi-phonon process in the triplet channel also leads to faster intra-molecular singlet exciton formation.

The diﬀerent rates for singlet and triplet exciton formation predicted in the literature for inter-chain
recombination16-18 arise largely from the assumption that an inter-chain density-dependent electron transfer term
is an important factor in the recombination mechanism. This term couples states of the same ionicity. Since the
inter-chain charge transfer states are predominately ionic, while the intra-chain triplet exciton has more covalent
character than the intra-chain singlet exciton, the rate for the singlet exciton formation is correspondingly greater.

Most of the recent experimental and theoretical work is reviewed in refs19,20.
In this paper we develop a model of inter-chain electron-hole recombination between pairs of parallel polymers
that involves intermediate, loosely bound (‘charge-transfer’) states that lie energetically between the electron-hole
continuum and the ﬁnal, strongly bound exciton states. We argue that as a consequence of electronic selection rules,
inter-molecular inter-conversion occurs from the charge transfer to the lowest energy exciton states. This process is
then limited by multi-phonon emission, which decreases approximately exponentially with the energy gap between
the pair of states. Since the lowest singlet and triplet exciton energies are split by a large exchange energy (of ca. 0.7
eV21), while the charge-transfer states are quasi-degenerate, the triplet exciton formation rate is considerably smaller
than the singlet exciton rate.

Multi-phonon emission has already been discussed as a possible factor in determining the overall singlet exciton

be either intra-molecular odd parity excitons or inter-molecular even parity excitons. (In each case these correspond to the
lowest pseudo-momentum members of each exciton family, as described in Section III.) Also shown are the respective lifetimes

yield in intra-molecular processes15,22. However, our model diﬀers from these works by emphasizing the important
role of the intermediate inter-chain charge-transfer states.

In the next section we introduce the relevant rate equations and derive an expression for the singlet exciton yield
as a function of the characteristic relaxation times. In the following section the microscopic model of inter-molecular
inter-conversion is described and the inter-conversion rates are calculated.

II. BASIC MODEL AND THE RATE EQUATIONS

Fig. 1 shows the energy level diagram for this model. The electrons and holes are injected into the polymer device
with random spin orientations. Under the inﬂuence of the electric ﬁeld the electrons and holes migrate through the
device, rapidly being captured (in less than 10−12 s) to form the weakly bound charge-transfer singlet and triplet
excitons, SCT and TCT , respectively. We assume that no spin mixing occurs during this process, and thus the ratio
of SCT to TCT is 1:3.23 If the inter-system-crossing (ISC) between TCT and SCT (with a rate 1/τISC) competes
with the inter-conversion from TCT to the triplet exciton, TX , (with a rate 1/τTCT ) and 1/τTCT is smaller than the
inter-conversion rate (1/τSCT ) from SCT to the singlet exciton, SX , then the singlet yield is enhanced.

The charge-transfer states might be either intra-molecular loosely bound excitons or weakly bound positive and
negative polarons on neighboring chains.
Intra-molecular charge-transfer states are Mott-Wannier excitons whose
relative electron-hole wavefunctions are odd under electron-hole exchange24. A crucial characteristic of these states is
that, because of their odd electron-hole parity, the probability of ﬁnding the electron and hole on the same molecular
repeat-unit is zero. Thus, they experience very small exchange interactions and therefore the singlet and triplet states
are quasi-degenerate24,25. Similarly, the inter-molecular weakly bound positive and negative polarons - although now
possessing even electron-hole parity - also experience weak exchange interactions as necessarily the electron and hole
are on diﬀerent repeat units, and thus singlet and triplet states are also quasi-degenerate. Furthermore, since the
charge-transfer excitons are also weakly bound with relatively large electron-hole separations, there exist eﬃcient
spin-ﬂipping mechanisms, such as spin-orbit coupling, or exciton dissociation via the electric ﬁeld or by scattering

from free carriers and defects. In this paper we focuss on inter-conversion to the intra-molecular excitons from the
inter-chain charge-transfer excitons.

The strongly bound excitons, SX and TX, are intra-molecular states. The inter-conversion process from SCT to
SX and from TCT to TX depends on the nature of SCT and TCT . The mechanism for bi-molecular inter-conversion is
described more fully in the next section. In this section we describe the kinetics by classical rate equations. The use
of classical rate equations is justiﬁed if rapid inter-conversion follows the ISC between TCT and SCT , as then there
28. We also note that since inter-conversion is followed by
will be no coherence or recurrence between TCT and SCT
rapid vibrational-relaxation (in a time of

10−13 s) these processes are irreversible.

We ﬁrst consider the case where ISC occurs directly via the spin-orbit coupling operator. This operator converts

Alternatively, we might consider ISC via a spin-randomization process, whereby the charge-transfer excitons are
scattered into charge-transfer triplets with a probability of 3/4 and charge-transfer singlets with a probability of 1/4.
Then the rate equations are those of the Appendix of ref19 and the singlet exciton yield becomes19,

of SCT and TCT , and the ISC rate. The singlet yield is plotted in Fig. 2 as a function of γ. We now describe the
calculation of the relative rates.

We now discuss the contribution of the vibrational wavefunctions to the total matrix element. Inter-molecular inter-
conversion is an iso-energetic process which occurs from the lowest pseudo-momentum state of the charge-transfer
manifold and the lowest vibrational levels of this state to the lowest pseudo-momentum state of the intra-molecular
excitons at the same energy as the initial level. Thus, the vibrational levels in Eq. (23) are νP + = 0 and νP − = 0.
However, the vibrational levels in Eq. (24) are determined by the conservation of energy.

IV. ESTIMATE OF THE INTER-CONVERSION RATES

Since inter-conversion from the inter-molecular to the intra-molecular charge-transfer excitons is forbidden by
symmetry, we now only discuss inter-conversion to the lowest excitons, SX or TX . (As remarked in footnote30, inter-
conversion to higher-lying exciton states is allowed, but if this happens recombination is an intra-molecular process
via the intra-molecular charge-transfer excitons.) Thus, the state label a is now either SX or TX , and the number of
phonons emitted, ν2, is either νS or νT , as determined by Eq. (45).

Within the Mott-Wannier basis the exciton wavefunction overlaps are easy to calculate. Using tinter = 0.1 eV18,

the interchain distance as 4 ˚A and standard semi-empirical Coulomb interactions gives

The polaron Huang-Rhys parameter, Sp, is not accurately known for light emitting polymers. However, we expect it to
be similar to the SX exciton Huang-Rhys parameter. The relaxation energy of the SX exciton has been experimentally
determined as 0.07 eV in PPV32, with a similar value calculated for ‘ladder’ PPP in ref33. From the ﬁgures in ref34,
we estimate the relaxation energy to be 0.12 eV in ladder PPP (where the phenyl rings are planar) and 0.25 eV in
PPP (where the phenyl rings are free to rotate). Thus, taking the relaxation energy as 0.1 eV and ~ω = 0.2 eV implies
that Sp ∼
0.5 and assuming that the energy diﬀerence between the strongly bound
singlet exciton (SX ) and the intra-molecular charge-transfer excitons of
0.8 eV is approximately the energy diﬀerence
between the singlet exciton and the inter-molecular charge-transfer excitons, we can estimate the inter-conversion rate
1011 s−1 (or τSCT ∼

The ISC rate is also not accurately known, with quoted values ranging from 0.3 ns22, 4 ns35 and 10 ns36. Neverthe-
less, despite this uncertainty, we see that the estimated triplet inter-conversion rate is comparable to or slower than
the ISC rate, which from Eq. (7) implies a large singlet exciton yield.

V. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

We propose a theory of electron-hole recombination via inter-molecular inter-conversion from inter-molecular weakly
bound polaron pairs (or charge-transfer excitons) to intra-molecular excitons. This theory is applicable to parallel
polymer chains. A crucial aspect of the theory is that both the intra-molecular and inter-molecular excitons are
eﬀective-particles, which are described by both a relative-particle wavefunction and a center-of-mass wavefunction.
This implies two electronic selection rules.

1. The parity of the relative-particle wavefunction implies that inter-conversion occurs from the even parity inter-
molecular charge-transfer excitons to the strongly bound intra-molecular excitons and not to the intra-molecular
charge-transfer excitons (namely, the ﬁrst odd parity exciton).
(However, if the inter-chain charge transfer
excitons lie higher in energy than the second family of even parity intra-chain exciton, recombination will be an
intra-molecular process.)

2. The orthonormality of the center-of-mass wavefunctions ensures that inter-conversion occurs from the charge-
transfer excitons to the lowest branch of the strongly bound exciton families, and not to higher lying members
of these families.

These selection rules imply that inter-conversion is then predominately a multi-phonon process, determined by the
Franck-Condon factors. These factors are exponentially smaller for the triplet manifold than the singlet manifold
because of the large exchange energy.

There is also a contribution to the rates from the overlap of the relative-particle wavefunctions, which again
are smaller in the triplet manifold, because the triplet exciton has a smaller particle-hole separation and has more
covalent character than its singlet counterpart18. As a consequence, the inter-conversion rate in the triplet manifold
is signiﬁcantly smaller than that of the singlet manifold, and indeed it is comparable to the ISC rates. Thus, it is
possible for the singlet exciton yield is expected to be considerably enhanced over the spin-independent value of 25%
in conjugated polymers.

Any successful theory must explain the observation that the singlet exciton yield is close to 25% for molecules
and increases with conjugation length3,5. This theory qualitatively predicts this trend for two reasons. First, the
eﬀective-particle description of the exciton states is only formally exact for long chains. This description breaks down
when the chain length (or more correctly, conjugation length) is comparable to the particle-hole separation. In this
case separation of the center-of-mass motion and the relative-particle motion is no longer valid. Then the quantum
numbers n and j (which describe the relative-particle wavefunction and center-of-mass wavefunction, respectively)
are no longer independent quantum numbers. Inter-conversion is then expected to take place between all the states
lying between the charge-transfer state and the lowest exciton state. However, as the chain length increases inter-
conversion to higher lying states is suppressed in favor of the lowest lying exciton. This prediction is conﬁrmed by
a recent quantum mechanical calcuations by Beljonne et al.37. The second reason that the singlet exciton yield is
enhanced in polymers over molecules is that the Huang-Rhys parameters decrease as the conjugation length increases,
and thus the relative rate (given by Eq. (54)) increases.

We note that the eﬀective-particle description is still valid when there is self-trapping. In this case the center-of-
mass wavefuctions are not the particle-in-the-box wavefunctions appropriate for a linear chains (Eq. (19)), but they
are the ortho-normalized functions appropriate for the particular potential well trapping the eﬀective particle. The
key point is that because these are ortho-normalized functions inter-conversion occurs between a pair of states with
the same center-of-mass quantum numbers, as described in this paper.

11

This theory has been formulated for an idealized case of suﬃciently long, parallel polymer chains. The applicability
of this theory for polymer light emitting displays needs verifying by performing calculations on oligomers of arbitrary
length and arbitrary relative conformations.

Finally, we remark that this theory presents strategies for enhancing the singlet exciton yield. Ideally, the polymer
chains should be well conjugated, closely packed and parallel. The last two conditions ensure that the inter-chain
charge-transfer excitons lie energetically below high-lying even-parity families of intra-molecular excitons, and thus
recombination is an inter-chain inter-conversion process and not an intra-molecular process via the intra-molecular
charge-transfer excitons. Intra-molecular recombination is not desirable because although inter-conversion from the
intra-chain charge-transfer excitons is slower in the triplet manifold than the singlet manifold, both rates are expected
to be faster than the ISC rate. The relative inter-molecular interconversion rates are also increased when the electron-
lattice coupling is reduced. This suggests that the singlet exciton yield is enhanced in rigid, well-conjugated polymers.

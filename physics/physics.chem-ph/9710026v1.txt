Abstract

Reported here are results of theoretical calculations on Fe(H2O)6

3+,

Fe(H2O)5(OH)2+, three isomers of Fe(H2O)4(OH)2

+, and Fe(H2O)3(OH)2

+

to investigate the molecular mechanisms of hydrolysis of ferric ion in wa-

ter. The combination of density functional electronic structure techniques

and a dielectric continuum model for electrostatic solvation applied to the

Fe(H2O)6

3+ complex yields an estimate of -1020 kcal/mol (experimental val-

ues -1037 kcal/mol to -1019 kcal/mol) for the absolute free energy of the

aqueous ferric ion. The free energy change for the ﬁrst hydrolysis reaction is

predicted reasonably (2 kcal/mol predicted compared to 3 kcal/mol experi-

mental). For the second hydrolysis reaction, we found an unexpected low en-

ergy isomer of Fe(H2O)4(OH)2

+ with ﬁve ligands in the inner sphere and one

water outside. The hexa-coordinate cis and trans isomers are, respectively,

slightly lower and higher in energy. Calculations on the penta-coordinate

species Fe(H2O)3(OH)2

+ suggest that extrusion of the outer sphere water is

nearly thermoneutral. The reaction free energy for the second hydrolysis is

predicted in the range 16-18 kcal/mol, higher than the experimental value of

1

5 kcal/mol. In view of the facts that the theoretical predictions are higher

than experimental values, and that novel structures were encountered among

products of the second hydrolysis, we argue that conformational entropy is an

important omission in this theoretical treatment of net reaction free energies.

A fuller cataloging of low energy hydrolysis products and direct calculations

of partition functions of the isolated complexes should help in modeling equi-

librium speciation in groundwaters.

1. Introduction

A molecular theoretical account of the free energetics of the reactions

[Fe(H2O)n(OH)(m−1)]4−m + H2O → [Fe(H2O)n−1(OH)m]3−m + H3O+

(1)

in water can beneﬁt from discrimination of the conformers that are present under common

conditions. Entropic contributions to the solution thermodynamics may reﬂect multiple

conﬁgurations that occur. Thus information on the conformers present should assist in

accurately describing temperature variations of solvation properties. In addition, theoretical

study of the molecular structure of the species participating these reactions should teach us

about the molecular mechanisms involved and provide a benchmark of current theoretical

tools for modeling speciation of metal ions in groundwaters [1,2,3].

The condition of ferrous and ferric ions in solution has long been of speciﬁc interest to

explanations of electron exchange processes [4,5,6,7]. The hydrolysis product Fe(H2O)5OH2+

often contributes signiﬁcantly to the rate of ferric ion reduction in water because the speciﬁc

rate constant for ferric-ferrous electron exchange is about a thousand times larger for the

hydrolyzed compared to unhydrolyzed hexaaquoferric ion [8]. The net standard free energy

change (about 3 kcal/mol [9]) for the ﬁrst hydrolysis reaction,

Fe(H2O)6

3+ + H2O → Fe(H2O)5(OH)2+ + H3O+,

(2)

is small compared to the size of the various contributions that must be considered in theo-

retical modeling of these solution species.

In contrast to the great volume of work on electron transfer involving such species,

reactions of particular interest here transfer a proton from a water ligated to a Fe3+ ion to

a free water molecule. The second hydrolysis,

Fe(H2O)5OH2+ + H2O → Fe(H2O)4(OH)2

+ + H3O+,

(3)

raises more seriously the possibility of participation by several isomers in the mechanism

and thermodynamics of these reactions.

3

This work takes ferric ion hydrolysis as a demonstration system for determination of

the utility of current theoretical tools for modeling of speciation of metal ions in aqueous

solution. At this stage we have not considered multiple metal center aggregates. We report

below encouraging agreement with experimental thermochemistries but with unexpected

results that must be addressed for further progress in describing these chemical systems in

molecular terms.

2. Approach

The physical idea of treating an inner solvation shell on a diﬀerent footing from the rest

of the solvent has considerable precedent [10]. Friedman and Krishnan referred to these ap-

proaches as hybrid models and criticized them on the grounds that individual contributions

to the thermodynamic properties of ﬁnal interest could not be determined with suﬃcient

accuracy to draw new conclusions from the ﬁnal results. However, particularly for highly

charged and chemically complex ions, the hybrid approaches seem indispensable [11]. Com-

putational and conceptual progress in the 25 years since that Friedman-Krishnan review has

made these approaches interesting once again. In what follows, we ﬁrst elaborate on the

calculational techniques used. An appendix discusses some of the statistical thermodynamic

issues underlying these hybrid models.

2.1. Electronic Structure Calculations

Reliable estimation of free energies of dissociation in aqueous media requires a similarly

reliable determination of the process in the gas phase. Given the well known diﬃculties

associated with electron correlation in transition metal complexes, and our intent to extend

this work to larger and more complex systems, we chose to explore this problem with the

B3LYP hybrid density functional theory (DFT) [12,13]. This approximation is an eﬀective

compromise between accuracy and computational expense, and has been shown to give

usefully accurate predictions of metal-ligand bond energies in a number of molecules [14,15].

In the present application however, we were less interested in the metal-ligand bond energy

4

than in the energies for successive elimination of protons from the H2O ligands bound to

Fe3+. This may be a somewhat less severe test of the functional. The details of our approach

and estimates of the errors follow.

The geometry and vibrational frequencies of the metal complex were determined using

the 6-311+G basis set for the metal ion and the 6-31G* basis set for the ligands [13]. The

former is contracted from Wachters’ [16] primitive Gaussian basis (including the functions

describing the 4s and 4p atomic orbitals) and augmented with the diﬀuse d-function of Hay

[17]. The ligand basis set contains a polarization function of d-character on the oxygen. At

the optimum geometry, a single calculation was done to determine the energy in a more

extended basis (6-31++G**) that includes polarization and diﬀuse functions on both the

oxygen and hydrogen centers. Atomic charges were determined in this extended basis as

well using the ChelpG [18] capability (RF e=2.02 ˚A ) in the Gaussian94 package [13]. All Fe

species are high-spin (d5) treated in the spin-unrestricted formalism.

One might argue, on the basis of the OH− character expected in the product complexes,

that the geometry optimization should also be done with a diﬀuse basis set for the ligands.

This was found unnecessary by explicit calculations on the partial reaction

Fe(H2O)6

3+ → Fe(H2O)5(OH)2+ + H+.

(4)

The endothermicity of this reaction computed from a single point calculation with the 6-

31+G* basis at its optimum geometry diﬀers by only 0.2 kcal/mole from the result obtained

with the smaller basis. More important are additional polarization and diﬀuse functions on

the hydrogens; for example, neglecting zero-point corrections, the B3LYP endothermicities

are 29.2 kcal/mole(6-31G*), 25.4 kcal/mole(6-31+G*), and 28.1 kcal/mole(6-31++G**).

A ﬁnal consideration regarding basis set convergence is the importance of polariza-

tion (f-functions) on the metal center. This was examined by augmenting the 6-311+G

Fe basis with two f-functions (α = 0.25,0.75) split about a value (α = 0.4) optimized for

Fe(H2O)6

3+. In this larger basis an endothermicity of 27.9 kcal/mole results compared to

the value 28.1 kcal/mole obtained without the f-functions. The correction to the second

5

hydrolysis is only slightly larger, ∼ 0.5 kcal/mole. We thus conclude that the B3LYP de-

protonation energies are nearly converged with respect to further improvements in the basis

set. A conservative estimate might be associated with the change observed between the 6-

311+G/6-31+G* results and the 6-311+G(2f)/6-31++G** results, or about 2-3 kcal/mole.

Convergence of the results with respect to basis set does not address the accuracy ex-

pected with the B3LYP method. In so far as the water molecules retain their identity when

bound to the metal ion, we expect the error in the hydrolysis reaction to be approximated

by the error observed for the analogous reaction for a single H2O molecule. The procedure

outlined above was therefore used to determine the energies and zero-point energies (ZPE)

for a number of species associated with the neutral and ionic dissociation channels of H2O.

They are reported in Table I, and can be used to determine the properties and reaction

energies reported in Table II. The H2O thermochemistries shown there are in excellent

agreement with experiment. For example, the error associated with the reaction

H2O → H+ + OH−

(5)

is underestimated by less than 2 kcal/mole. The errors in the other dissociation channels

are similar.

2.2. Electrostatic Solvation Calculations

Electrostatic interactions of hydrated ferric ions with the aqueous environment are ex-

pected to be of ﬁrst importance in this solution chemistry. These hydrolysis reactions are

written so that other contributions to the net free energy, e.g. packing, might balance

reasonably. Thus, continuum dielectric solvation modeling is a reasonable approach to

studying these solution processes;

it is physical, computationally feasible, and can pro-

vide a basis for more molecular theory [19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29]. The dielectric

model produces an approximation to the interaction part of the chemical potential, µ∗ of

the solute; in notation used below µ∗ = −RT lnhexp(−∆U)i0 where for this case ∆U is

the solute-solvent electrostatic interaction potential energy and the brackets indicate the

6

average over the thermal motion of the solvent uninﬂuenced by the charge distribution of

the solute [19,20,21,22,23,24,27,29]. Free energy contributions due to non-electrostatic in-

teractions are neglected. We address free energy changes due to atomic motions internal to

the complexes on the basis of gas phase determinations of the vibrational frequencies and

partition functions. The solvation calculation treats all species as rigid; we comment later on

the consequences of this approximation and on the possibilities for relaxing it . The solute

molecular surface was the boundary between volume enclosed by spheres centered on all

atoms and the exterior. The sphere radii were those determined empirically by Stefanovich

[30], except RF e=2.08 ˚A for the ferric ion. The ferric ion is well buried by the ligands of

these complexes and slight variations of this latter value were found to be unimportant.

The numerical solutions of the Poisson equation were produced with a boundary integral

procedure as sketched in references [23,27] typically employing approximately 16K boundary

elements. The accuracy of the numerical solution of the dielectric model is expected to be

better than a kcal/mol for the electrostatic solvation free energy.

3. Results and Discussion

The pertinent energies for Fe(H2O)6

3+ and other species involved in hydrolysis processes

are compiled in Tables I and II. The magnitudes of the various components entering into the

gas phase hydrolysis free energy are reported in Table III, while Table IV adds the solvation

contributions to the free energy and compares the total with experiment. Table V summa-

rizes geometrical information and partial atomic charges computed from the electrostatic

potential ﬁt are presented in Table VI.

3.1. Fe(H2O)6

3+

The structure of the Fe(H2O)6

3+ complex, Th symmetry, is shown in Figure 1. The

B3LYP approximation gives an Fe-O distance of 2.061 ˚A . By way of comparison, with

the identical basis set the Hartree-Fock approximation yields 2.066 ˚A . These distances

are similar to the recent Hartree-Fock results of ˚Akesson, et al. [31],RF eO = 2.062 ˚A ,

7

and the gradient-corrected DFT(BPW86) calculations of Li, et al. [32], RF eO= 2.067 ˚A .

These theory values cluster in the upper end of the range of distances (1.97 ˚A – 2.05 ˚A )

determined experimentally [33,34,35]. Neutron scattering measurements report 2.01 ˚A in

concentrated electrolyte solutions [33]. The solution EXAFS result (1.98 ˚A ) is close to the

crystallographic determinations, 1.97 ˚A – 2.00 ˚A [34]. In their recent review, Ohtaki and

Radnai discuss a number of other experiments and conclude the distance lies in the range

of 2.01 – 2.05 ˚A [35].

Though these theory values are compatible with the upper end of this range, they are far

from the EXAFS result (1.98 ˚A ) that might be the most reliable experimental determination.

While investigating this question, we found that the B3LYP value is stable with respect to

further improvements in the basis; if the basis is augmented with an f-function on the metal

and diﬀuse functions on the oxygens, the equilibrium distance decreases only slightly (RF e−O

= 2.053 ˚A ). As noted above, the B3LYP result is in close agreement with that from the

Hartree-Fock approximation. It would not be surprising, however, if the HF approximation

overestimated the bond length. Akesson, et al. [36,37] have previously observed that the

HF bond lengths for a series of ﬁrst row transition metal hydrates are systematically too

long. They ﬁnd that correlation eﬀects and the inﬂuence of the second hydration shell each

act to reduce the bond length by about 0.01 ˚A . Even with these corrections the theoretical

bond length is still much larger than 1.98 ˚A . As an additional data point, the local-density-

approximation with the present basis yields RF e−O = 2.013 ˚A , in better agreement with

the EXAFS and crystallographic determinations. However, while the LDA generally gives

reasonable geometries for transition metal complexes [38,39], Sosa, et al. [39] ﬁnd that it

tends to underestimate the lengths of dative bonds, such as the one discussed here, and this

might further support a bond length toward the upper end of the range.

The atomic partial charges computed here for the hexaaquoferric ion are given in Table

VI. Note that the charge assigned to the ferric ion is substantially less than 3e, and that

the magnitudes of the charges on the oxygen and hydrogen atoms are substantially greater

8

than is common with eﬀective force ﬁelds used for simulation of liquid water.

As discussed in the appendix, a value for the absolute free energy of the ferric ion can

be obtained from a free energy of formation of the Fe(H2O)6

3+ complex from an isolated

Fe3+ (6S) ion and six water molecules (Table III), provided that no solvation contribution is

included for the atomic ion and that the actual, not standard state, species concentrations are

used. That absolute free energy in aqueous solution is -1020 kcal/mol. Experimental values

range from -1037 kcal/mol to -1019 kcal/mol [40,41,10,42]. We note that this theoretical

value takes no account of solvation eﬀects due to non-electrostatic interactions.

This agreement with experiment is encouraging. In computing the absolute free energy

there are a number of large contributions to the ﬁnal result. This contrasts to the hydrolysis

reactions where we have arranged things to encourage cancellation of errors. It is interesting

to examine the components contributing to the free energy in the gas phase (Table III). Not

surprisingly, the zero-point correction, +15 kcal/mole, is signiﬁcant. Under the standard

conditions, hypothetical p=1 atm ideal gas with T=298.15 K, there is the large, unfavorable

diﬀerential entropy contribution, +47 kcal/mole. This arises from the necessity of sequester-

ing six water molecules in a dilute gas. The net free energy found for the gas phase reaction

is -602 kcal/mole. Table IV addresses the solution phase aspects of this thermochemistry.

(See the Appendix also.) About half of the ideal entropy penalty mentioned is regained in

the liquid because of the higher concentration of water molecules. The diﬀerential solvation

free energy adds another -391 kcal/mole of (favorable) free energy for a net absolute free

energy of hydration of -1020 kcal/mole.

This estimate of the absolute free energy of the ferric ion is close to the value -

1037 kcal/mole reported by Li, et al. [32] as a hydration enthalpy. The Li, et al., value con-

tains some terms that would be appropriate if the hydration enthalpy were sought and some

terms that would contribute to the hydration free energy; thus comparison of that previous

value with the present result is not straightforward. In fact, the most pragmatic calculation

of the hydration enthalpy within the dielectric continuum model is nontrivial. The enthalpy

would be then obtained by determining a temperature derivative of the chemical potential.

9

The appropriate temperature derivative determines the enthalpy directly or, alternatively,

the solvation entropy so that the desired enthalpy might be determined by diﬀerencing with

the already known chemical potential. That temperature derivative would generally involve

also the temperature variation of the radii-parameters [19,20,21,27,29]. The variations with

thermodynamic state of the radii-parameters have not been well studied [21]. There is good

agreement, however, in many of the components contributing to this hydration enthalpy.

Li, et al., report a gas phase energy of formation of -652.2 kcal/mole with the BPW86

gradient-corrected functional compared to the present B3LYP result of -655.2 kcal/mole,

and their solvation free energy is -444 kcal/mole vs. the -441 kcal/mole found here. Such

close agreement is encouraging, although somewhat fortuitous. Our gas phase energy of

formation includes a correction, not considered by Li, et al., of some 15 kcal/mole for the

zero-point energies. It is encouraging, however, that the estimates disagree by only about

15 kcal/mole, or some 1.5%. Additionally, the deﬁnition of the molecular surface adopted

by Li, et al., for the solvation calculation was substantially diﬀerent from that used here, as

were the radii-parameters used.

3.2. First and second hydrolysis reactions

We turn now to the ﬁrst deprotonation reaction Eq. 2. The structure found for

Fe(H2O)5OH2+ is displayed in Figure 2. The Fe-O (hydroxide) distance is 1.76 ˚A and

the Fe-O (water) distances lengthen to 2.10 ˚A – 2.15 ˚A . Assembling the results for the

standard free energy of this reaction we ﬁnd 2 kcal/mol, in surprisingly good agreement with

the experimental value of 3 kcal/mol [9]. This computed net free energy change is composed

of approximately -148 kcal/mol exothermic (favorable) change in isolated molecule free en-

ergy and +150 kcal/mol (unfavorable) net increase in solvation free energy. The solvation

contribution favors the reactant side here because it presents the most highly charged ion.

Changes in the radius assigned to the iron atom in the range 2.06 ˚A ≤RF e ≤2.10 ˚A lead

to changes of ± 1 kcal/mol in the predicted reaction free energy. This reaction was also

considered by Li, et al., [32] who ﬁnd it to be exothermic by 14 kcal/mole.

10

To treat the next hydrolysis Eq. 3 we must consider Fe(H2O)4(OH)2

+ species. Figure

3 shows the stable structures found. Further lengthening of both the Fe-O(water) and

Fe-O(hydroxide) distances is noted(Table V) in the cis and trans six-coordinate species

by 0.07-0.14 ˚A compared to the Fe(H2O)5OH2+.

In the gas phase, the cis structure is

predicted to be the lowest energy conformer, slightly (1 kcal/mole) below the trans isomer.

This preference is reversed in solution, where the trans isomer is predicted to be slightly

more stable. We note that the most current force ﬁelds applied to simulation of ferric ions

in solution place the cis structure signiﬁcantly higher in energy than the trans [3].

We were surprised to discover a stable outer sphere complex during our search for the

stable trans structure. The structure is given in Figure 3. The distances between the

hydroxyl oxygens and the outer sphere water are typical of hydrogen bonds. Explicit calcu-

lation of the vibrational frequencies show it to be a true local minimum, lying less than a

kcal/mol higher in energy than the cis conformer.

The interaction of the outer sphere water with the remainder of the ferric hydrate com-

plex can be partially characterized by ﬁnding the energy of that complex without the outer

sphere partner. The structure obtained for that penta-coordinate ferric ion is shown in Fig-

ure 4. The penta-coordinate complex can stably adopt a conformation similar to that of

Figure 3 also in the absence of the outer sphere water. In terms of the zero-point corrected

electronic energy, this outer sphere complex is stable with respect to loss of the H2O by

about 7 kcal/mole. Consideration of the entropic contributions to the free energy ﬁnd the

complex still stable with respect to loss of H2O, but the diﬀerential solvation contributions

reverse this conclusion. Thus, the dissociation of the outer sphere complex is an essen-

tially thermoneutral process. We suspect such intermediates play an important role in the

mechanism of the ligand exchange with the solvent.

These three conformers lead to estimates of 16 kcal/mol, 16 kcal/mol, and 18 kcal/mol

for the reaction free energy of the second hydrolysis for trans, outer, and cis sphere products,

respectively; the experimental value is approximately 5 kcal/mol [9,43]. We note that as in

the case of the ﬁrst hydrolysis, the gas phase predictions lead to an exothermic reaction; it

11

is the diﬀerential solvation free energy that tips the scales in favor of endothermicity.

3.3. Role of conformational entropy

The issue of the internal motions of the complexes, and the near degeneracy of several

conformers, raises also the issue of conformational entropy of these species. For example, in

the second hydrolysis reaction, factors such as -RTln 3 arise if the three isomers discussed

here are considered isoenergetic. [However, the multiplicity of isoenergetic states will surely

not be just 3 and, furthermore, entropy diﬀerences are required here.] As another example,

the Th hexaaquo complex surely has a number of low-lying structures involving the rotation

of the plane of an individual H2O. More generally, this conformational entropy would be

appropriately included by computing the solvation contribution to the chemical potential,

µ∗, of the complex according to

µ∗ = −RT ln

c e−µ∗(c)/RT
x(0)

c
X

(6)

where the sum indicated is over conformations c weighted by the normalized population, the

mole fractions x(0)

c

of conformers when there is no interaction between solute and solvent,

and further the summand is the Boltzmann factor of the solvation free energies, perhaps

from a physical model such as the dielectric model used here, for each conformation. [The

treatment of the thermodynamics of ﬂexible complexes in solution is also discussed further

in the appendix and in Reference [44].] The solvation contribution to the chemical poten-

tial Eq. 6 would then be combined with the isolated cluster partition function to obtain

the free energies of the species involved and free energy changes for the reactions [44]. Fi-

nally, an entropic contribution, including any conformational entropy, would be obtained

by temperature diﬀerentiation of the full chemical potential. The isolated cluster partition

functions would properly include an entropy associated with the multiplicity of isoenergetic

conformational states. It is reasonable to expect that this conformational entropy increases

progressively with hydrolysis, i.e. the products here are “less ordered,” and have higher con-

formational entropy than their reactants. It is thus signiﬁcant that the predicted reaction

12

free energies are higher than the experiment; inclusion of conformational entropy should

lower these reaction free energies.

We note that Li, et al. [32] argue that inclusion of a second solvation shell substantially

improves the accuracy of the thermochemical predictions. The present results do not seem to

force us to larger clusters. Although it is true that proper inclusion of more water molecules

should permit a more convincing treatment, inclusion of more distant water molecules makes

the neglect of conformational entropy less tenable.

In any case, comparison of dielectric

model treatments with thermochemical results only permits limited conclusions because of

the empirical adjustability of radii-parameters.

4. Conclusions

Given the balance of the large contributions that must be considered, the observed ac-

curacy of the computed hydrolysis reaction free energies reactions is encouraging. Evidently

many structural possibilities will have to be treated for a full description of ferric ion specia-

tion in water, eventually considering higher aggregates and anharmonic vibrational motions

of the strongly interacting water molecules and other ligands. These issues are probably

best pursued through development of a molecular mechanics force ﬁeld to screen structures

rapidly, reserving electronic structure calculations for veriﬁcation of the important struc-

tures found and reﬁnement of the force ﬁeld. The energetic ordering found here for isomers

of Fe(H2O)4(OH)2

+ is cis (lowest), outer sphere, and trans (highest), but all these energies

are within about 2 kcal/mol. Molecular mechanics force ﬁelds might be reparameterized

to account for these results [1,2,3]. Identiﬁcation of prominent isomers should simplify and

improve the modeling of the temperature variations of thermodynamic properties. It de-

serves emphasis also that substantial contributions to these reaction free energies, and to

the accumulated uncertainties, are associated with the water partners in these reactions, i.e.

the free energies associated with solvation of H2O and H3O+. A similar comment would

apply for other common oxy-acids and ligands in water, e.g. carbonate, nitrate, sulfate,

and phosphate. Molecular descriptions of metal ion speciation will be incomplete without

13

accurate molecular characterizations of these species in aqueous solution.

APPENDIX

Here we specify with greater care some of the statistical thermodynamic considerations

relevant to solvation free energies obtained from cluster calculations of the present variety

[13]. We note that these issues are of minor importance for the hydrolysis reactions that

are the focus of this paper. However, these considerations become more important for the

absolute free energy reported for the aqueous ferric ion and for the free energy of dissociation

of the outer sphere complex.

Utilizing calculations on clusters

We ﬁrst specify more fully and explain the procedure from computing the absolute free

energy of the ferric ion given in Table IV on the basis of cluster results obtained from

density functional theory and the dielectric continuum estimate of solvation contributions.

The result of the development here is a formula for the chemical potential of the ferric ion:

µF e3+ = RT ln[

ρF e3+V
qM hhe−∆U/RT ii0,M

] − 6µW ,

(7)

Here ρF e3+ the number density of ferric ions in the solution, V is the volume of the sys-

tem, qM is the partition function of the isolated hexaaquoferric complex (M=Fe(H2O)6

3+),

−RT lnhhe−∆U/RT ii0,M is the solvation free energy of the complex, and µW is the chemical

potential of the water. The conclusion drawn from this formula is that the desired absolute

free energy of the hydrated ferric ion is obtained from the chemical potential change of the

reaction Fe3++6H2O → Fe(H2O)6

3+ except with the additional provisions that the chemical

14

potentials should be evaluated on a fully molecular basis at the water concentration of in-

terest and no solvation contribution should be included for the atomic ion. The subsequent

section notes how the isolated molecule partition functions should be used to obtain the

chemical potentials at the required concentrations.

As suggested above, the fundamental issue is the use of the cluster calculation Fe(H2O)6

3+

to obtain the chemical potential, µF e3+, of the hydrated ferric ion, Fe3+. It is clear on physical

grounds that such an approach should be advantageous when the identiﬁcation of a relevant

cluster is physically obvious and when the inner shell of the cluster requires a specialized

treatment. What happens when the relevant cluster is not so obvious? What about cases

when more than one cluster should be considered? How might this approach be justiﬁed

more fully and how might the calculations be improved?

The statistical mechanical topic underlying the considerations here is that of association

equilibrium [45,46,47] and is often associated with considerations [48] of ‘physical clusters.’ A

suitable clustering deﬁnition [45,49] is required for these discussions to be explicit and heavier

statistical mechanical formalisms can be deployed [45,46,47]. However, the treatment here

aims for maximal simplicity. This argument is an adaptation of the potential distribution

theorem [50].

In order to involve information on clusters, we express the density of interest in terms

of cluster concentrations. Thus, if the Fe3+ ion appears only once in each cluster, i.e.

if

mononuclear clusters need be considered, then we would write

ρF e3+ =

ρM

XM

(8)

where M identiﬁes a molecular cluster considered and the sum is over all molecular clusters

that can form. A satisfactory clustering deﬁnition [45,49] insures that each ferric ion can be

assigned to only one molecular cluster, e.g. that a molecular cluster with one ferric ion and

six water molecules is not counted as six clusters of a ferric ion with ﬁve water molecules.

The calculations above assumed M = Fe(H2O)6

3+, and that was it. In the more general

case that not all clusters are mononuclear, Eq. 8 would involve the obvious stoichiometric

15

coeﬃcients. The concentrations ρM are obtained from

ρM = zF e3+znM

W (qM /V )

e−∆U/RT

DD

.

0,M

EE

(9)

nM is the number of water molecules in the cluster of type M, (six in the example carried

long here); zF e3+ and zW are the activity of the ferric ion and the water, respectively; i.e.

zγ = eµγ /RT ; qM = qM (T ) is a conventionally deﬁned canonical partition function for the

cluster of type M [45,46,47,49]. The indicated average utilizes the thermal distribution of

cluster and solvent under the conditions that there is no interaction between them. ∆U is the

potential energy of interaction between the cluster and the solvent. In the example carried

along here we do not pay attention to any counter-ions since those issues are tangential to

the current considerations.

Eq. 9 is most conveniently derived by considering a grand ensemble. Suppose we have a

deﬁnite clustering criterion: a cluster of a ferric ion and nM water molecules is formed when

exactly nM water molecules are within a speciﬁed distance d of a ferric ion. In the example

we have been carrying along, water molecules with oxygens within about 2.2 ˚A of a ferric

ion are in chemical interaction with the ferric ion. It would be natural to specify d ≤ 2.2 ˚A

for clustered ferric-water(oxygen) distances. The average number < NM > of such clusters

is composed as

Ξ(zF e3+, zW , T, V ) < NM > = zF e3+znM
W

Q(N, V, T |nM + 1)

Here Ξ(zF e3+, zW , T, V ) is the grand canonical partition function; NF e3+ is the number of

ferric ions in the systems and NW is the number of water molecules; Q(N, V, T |nM + 1) is

the canonical ensemble partition function with one speciﬁc ferric ion and nM speciﬁc water

molecules constrained to be clustered. The binomial coeﬃcient

provides the number of

nM -tuples of water molecules that can be selected from NW water molecules. Because of the

particle number factors in the summand the partition function there can also be considered

to be the partition function for N − 1 ferric ions and NW − nM water molecules but with

NW
nM

(cid:17)

an extra nM + 1 objects that constitute the cluster of interest. A reasonable distribution

of those nM + 1 extraneous objects is the distribution they would have in an ideal gas

phase; the Boltzmann factor for that distribution appears already in the integrand of the

Q(N, V, T |nM + 1) and the normalizing denominator for that distribution is nM !qM (T ). The

acquired factor nM ! cancels the remaining part of the combinatorial

. Adjusting the

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

dummy summation variables them leads to Eq. 9.

If we were to identify an activity for an M-cluster as zM = zF e3+znM

W we would obtain

from Eq. 9 the general statistical thermodynamic formulae of Reference [44].

A virtue of the derivation of Eq. 9 sketched here is that the primordial activities zF e3+ and

zW are clear from the beginning. This helps in the present circumstance where concentrations

and chemical potentials of many other species and combinations will be of interest also.

This is a reexpression according to clusters of a basic result known both within the context of

the potential distribution theorem [50] and diagrammatic (mathematical) cluster expansions.

For the latter context see Eq. 2.7 of Reference [47]. Rearranging, we obtain the desired

chemical potential

µF e3+ = −RT ln[

This is the result that was sought.

If higher-order clusters had been considered with a

suitable clustering deﬁnition, the ﬁnal result would have involved a more general polynomial

of zF e3+; higher powers of zF e3+ would appear in the sums that would replace Eq. 8 because of

the presence of higher powers of zF e3+ in some instances of Eq. 9. A virtue of Eq. 12 result

is that the thermodynamic activity of the water appears explicitly and that contribution

may be included in a variety of convenient ways, perhaps utilizing experimental results.

Furthermore, we see that there is no question whether a particular standard state for the

water is relevant or, for example, whether only the excess part of the chemical potential of

the water is required.

17

Notice that if the cluster deﬁnition had been restrictive enough that only the atomic

M=Fe3+ were present in appreciable concentration, i.e. nM =0 for all clusters that need

be considered, then Eq. 12 produces the previously known general answer for the chemical

potential of a ferric ion in solution [44,50]:

µF e3+/RT = ln[ρF e3+V /qF e3+] − ln

e−∆U/RT

(13)

E

It would be natural to choose the electronic energy of the atomic ferric ion as the zero of

energy and to anticipate that the degeneracy of the electronic degrees of freedom will be phys-

ically irrelevant. Then it would be suﬃcient to put V /qF e3+ = Λ3

F e3+ = (h2/2πmF e3+RT )3/2,

the cube of the deBroglie wavelength of the ferric ion. mF e3+ is the mass of the ion, and h is

the Planck constant. In any case, we deﬁne the absolute free energy of the hydrated ferric

ion as the second term on the right ∆µF e3+ = −RT ln

e−∆U/RT

. In view of Eq. 7 we then

D

have

∆µF e3+ = RT ln[

where M=Fe(H2O)6

3+. This Eq. 14 is the formula that was used.

A generalization of interest is the case that the solvent contains more than one species

that may complex with a speciﬁc metal ion. For example, suppose that ammonia may be

present in addition to water, that mixed complexes may form with ferric ion, and that these

complexes have been studied as clusters in the same way that the hexaaquoferric ion complex

was studied above. Then the result Eq. 12 is straightforwardly generalized by including the

proper combinations of activities of the additional ligands possible.

Standard State Modiﬁcations

Many ab initio electronic structure packages, such as the Gaussian94 package used here,

can produce molecular (or cluster) partition functions qM = qM (T ) and on this basis free

energies for the species and reactions considered. It should be emphasized that these are

typically applicable to a hypothetical ideal gas at concentrations corresponding to pressure

18

p=1 atm, see Table III. Thus, for example, these results determine the ideal chemical

potential µW = RT ln[ρW V /qW (T )]. However, because of the choice of hypothetical p=1 atm

ideal gas standard state, those results use ρW = p/RT with p=1 atm. In Gaussian94, for

example, this logarithmic concentration dependence is considered a translational entropy

contribution and, therefore, the entropic contribution to the reaction free energy of the ﬁrst

reaction in Table III is substantial and unfavorable. Because of the dilute reaction medium

associated with p=1 atm, the water molecules written as reactants in this reaction have more

freedom before complexation than they do after. This is an entirely expected physical eﬀect

but inappropriate in solution. To obtain results applicable at the concentration of liquid

water we determine that pressure parameter p = ρW RT from the experimental density of

liquid water ρW = 997.02 kg/m3. The required value is p=1354 atm as indicated in Table IV.

When this value is utilized in the expression for the translational entropy contributions, the

translational entropy penalty of Table III for the ﬁrst reaction is about half recovered.

Because the second through ﬁfth reactions of Table III were written to have the same

molecule numbers for reactions and products this translational entropy contribution is very

minor in those cases.

We note also that the experimental tabulation of Reference [10] suggested as an exper-

imental result for the absolute free energy of the hydrated ferric ion (-1037 kcal/mol) of

Table IV requires an adjustment of about 1.9 kcal/mol [24,42] for similar reasons. This

adjustment is insigniﬁcant for that property with the methods used here.

Abstract

We suggest a certain statistical interpretation for the entropy pro-
duced in driven thermodynamic processes. The exponential function
of the irreversible entropy re-weights the probability of the standard
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck-type thermodynamic ﬂuctuations.

In 1910 Einstein [1], paraphrasing Boltzmann’s lapidary formula S =
log W , expressed the probability distribution of thermodynamic variables x
through the entropy function S(x):

W (x) ∼ eS(x) .

(1)

This equation describes thermodynamic ﬂuctuations in Gaussian approxima-
tion properly. Going beyond the stationary features, the time-dependence of
ﬂuctuations xt can be characterized by a certain probability functional W [x]
over complete paths {xt; t ∈ (−∞,∞)}. I suggest that, in driven thermody-
namic processes, this probability is related to the irreversible entropy Sirr[x].
Symbolically, we can write the following relationship:

W [x] ∼ WOU [x − ¯x]eSirr[x] ,

(2)

where ¯xt is the ‘driving’ value of parameter xt and WOU [z] turns out to
correspond to ﬂuctuations zt of Ornstein-Uhlenbeck type. This relationship
oﬀers Sirr a certain statistical interpretation, somehow resembling Einstein’s
suggestion (1) for the equilibrium entropy S(x).
In this short note, Ein-
stein’s approach to the thermodynamic ﬂuctuations is outlined and standard
equations of time-dependent ﬂuctuations are invoked from irreversible ther-
modynamics. Then I give a precise form to the relationship (2) for driven
thermodynamic processes.

The equilibrium conditions for isolated composite thermodynamic sys-

tems derive from the maximum entropy principle:

S(x) = max ,

(3)

where S(x) is the total entropy of the system in function of certain free
thermodynamic parameters x [2]. If the function S(x) is maximum at x = ¯x
then ¯x is the equilibrium state. For example, x may be the temperature
T of a small (yet macroscopic) subsystem in the large isolated system of
temperature T = ¯x. Then, the function S(x) must be the total entropy of the
isolated system, depending on the variation of the subsystem’s temperature
around its equilibrium value. The equilibrium value ¯x [as well as S(x) itself]
may vary with the deliberate alteration of the initial conditions. Surely,
in our example the temperature T of the whole isolated system can always
be controlled at will. For later convenience, especially in treating driven

1

thermodynamic processes, we may prefer the explicit detailed notation S(x|¯x)
for S(x). Though S(¯x) − S(x) might qualify the lack of equilibrium, nearby
values x ≈ ¯x have no interpretation in phenomenological thermodynamics.
They only have it in the broader context of statistical physics.
In ﬁnite
thermodynamic systems there are ﬂuctuations around the equilibrium state
¯x and their probability follows Eq. (1):

W (x|¯x)dx = N eS(x|¯x)−S(¯x|¯x)dx .

(4)

Assume, for simplicity, that there is a single free variable x. The Taylor
expansion of the entropy function yields Gaussian ﬂuctuations:

W (x|¯x) =

1

√2πσ2

exp(cid:16)−

1
2σ2 (x − ¯x)2(cid:17) ,

where

σ2 = −S′′(¯x) ≡ −

∂2S(x|¯x)

∂x2

.

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)x=¯x

(5)

(6)

In our concrete example σ2 = T 2/C where C is the speciﬁc heat of the
subsystem.

We are going to regard the time-dependence of the parameter xt ﬂuctu-
ating around ¯x, according to the standard irreversible thermodynamics [2].
The time-dependent ﬂuctuation zt ≡ xt − ¯x is an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU)
stochastic process [3] of zero mean hzti ≡ 0 and of correlation

h zt zt′ iOU = σ2e−λ|t−t′| .

(7)

The relaxation rate λ of ﬂuctuations is related to the corresponding Onsager
kinetic constant γ by λ = γ/σ2. It can be shown that the probability dis-
tribution of xt = zt + ¯x at any ﬁxed time t is the Gaussian distribution (5)
as it must be. For the probability of the complete ﬂuctuation path zt, the
zero mean and correlation (7) are equivalent with the following functional
measure:

WOU [z]Dz = exp(cid:16)−

t )dt(cid:17)Dz ,

where a possible constant of normalization has been absorbed into the func-
tional measure Dz.
proceed to driven thermodynamic processes.

In order to construct and justify a relationship like (2) one needs to
In fact, we assume that we

2

are varying the parameter ¯x with small but ﬁnite velocity. Formally, the
parameter ¯x becomes time-dependent. For simplicity’s sake we assume that
the coeﬃcients σ, γ do not depend on ¯x or, at least, that we can ignore
their variation throughout the driven range of ¯xt. We deﬁne the irreversible
entropy production during the driven process as follows:

Sirr[x|¯x] =

1

σ2 Z (¯xt − xt)dxt .

(9)

In our concrete example dSirr = (C/T 2)(T − T )dT ≈ dQ(T −1 − T
) which
is indeed the entropy produced randomly by the heat transfer dQ from the
surrounding to the subsystem. By partial integration, Eq. (9) leads to an
alternative form:

−1

1

σ2 Z (¯xt − xt)d¯xt +

1
σ2 (x∞ − ¯x∞)2 .
Sirr[x|¯x] =
In relevant driven processes the entropy production is macroscopic,
i.e.,
Sirr ≫ 1 in kB-units, hence it is dominated by the integral term above.
I exploit this fact to replace expression (9) by

1
σ2 (x−∞ − ¯x−∞)2 −

(10)

Sirr[x|¯x] =

1

σ2 Z (¯xt − xt)d¯xt

(11)

which vanishes for constant ¯x [4]. In the sense of the guess (2), I suggest the
following form for the probability distribution of the driven path:

W [x|¯x] = N [¯x]WOU [x − ¯x]eSirr[x|¯x] .

(12)

The non-trivial normalizing pre-factor is a consequence of ¯x’s time-depen-
dence and will be derived below. Since the above distribution is a Gaussian
functional and Sirr[x|¯x] is a linear functional (11) of x, we can easily calculate
the expectation value of the irreversible entropy:

Sirr[¯x] ≡ hSirr[x|¯x]i =

1

2σ2 Z Z ˙¯xt ˙¯xt′e−λ|t−t′|dtdt′ .

(13)

In case of moderate accelerations ¨¯x ≪ λ ˙¯x, this expression reduces to the
standard irreversible entropy γ−1R ˙¯x2
t dt of the phenomenological theory of
driven processes [6]. Coming back to the normalizing factor in Eq. (12), we

3

can relate it to the mean entropy production (13): N [¯x] = exp(−Sirr[¯x]).
Hence, the ultimate form of Eq. (12) will be:

W [x|¯x] = WOU [x − ¯x]eSirr[x|¯x]−Sirr[¯x] .

(14)

This result gives the precise meaning to our symbolic relationship (2). If
the entropy production Sirr were negligible then the thermodynamic ﬂuctu-
ations xt − ¯xt would follow the OU statistics (7) like in case of a steady state
¯xt = const. Even in slow irreversibly driven processes Sirr may grow essen-
tial and exp[Sirr] will re-weight the probability of OU ﬂuctuations. The true
stochastic expectation value of an arbitrary functional F [x] can be expressed
by the OU expectation values of the re-weighted functional:

hF [x]i = DF [x]eSirr[x|¯x]−Sirr[¯x]EOU

.

(15)

I can verify the plausibility of Eq. (14) for the special case of small ac-
celerations. Let us insert Eqs. (8,11) and also Eq. (13) while ignore ¨¯x in
comparison with λ ˙¯x. We obtain:

W [x|¯x] = WOU [x − ¯x + λ−1 ˙¯x] .

(16)

Obviously, the ﬂuctuations of the driven system are governed by the OU
process zt (7) in the equilibrium case when ˙¯x ≡ 0. In driven process, when
˙¯x 6= 0, there is only a simple change: The OU ﬂuctuations happen around
the retarded value ¯xt − τ ˙¯x ≈ ¯xt−τ of the driven parameter. The lag τ
is
equal to the thermodynamic relaxation time 1/λ. Consequently, the driven
random path takes the following form:

xt = ¯xt−τ + zt ,

(17)

where zt is the equilibrium OU process (7). This result implies, in particular,
the equation hxti = ¯xt−τ which is just the retardation eﬀect well-known in the
thermodynamic theory of slightly irreversible driven processes. For example,
in case of an irreversible heating process the subsystem’s average temperature
will always be retarded by τ ˙T with respect to the controlling temperature
T [6].

Finally, let us summarize the basic features of Einstein’s formula (1) and
of the present proposal (2). They characterize via pretty compact formu-
lae the lack of equilibrium in steady and driven states, respectively. They

4

do it in terms of thermodynamic entropies while they refer to a statistical
context lying outside both reversible and irreversible thermodynamics. Both
formulae are only valid in the lowest non-trivial order and their correctness in
higher orders is questionable [7]. Contrary to their limited validity, they can
no doubt give an insight into the role of thermodynamic entropy in statistical
ﬂuctuations around both equilibrium or non-equilibrium states.

Our present proposal is ﬁrst of all limited to small velocities ˙¯x. In fact,
the ﬂuctuations of the thermodynamic parameters are governed by the
phenomenological Langevin equation (see, e.g., in [2]):

˙xt = −λ(xt − ¯x) + q2γ wt

which can be generalized for time-dependent ¯xt. To lowest order in ˙¯x
the result (17) comes out. In higher orders the Langevin equation gives
diﬀerent results from the present proposal.

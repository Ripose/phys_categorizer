The structure and dynamics of aqueous solvation of ethanol and ethylene are studied by DFT-
based Car-Parrinello molecular dynamics. We did not ﬁnd an enhancement of the structure of
the hydrogen bonded network of hydrating water molecules. Both ethanol and ethylene can easily
be accommodated in the hydrogen-bonded network of water molecules without altering its struc-
ture. This is supports the conclusion from recent neutron diﬀraction experiments that there is no
hydrophobic hydration around small hydrophobic groups. Analysis of the electronic charge dis-
tribution using Wannier functions shows that the dipole moment of ethanol increases from 1.8 D
to 3.1 D upon solvation, while the apolar ethylene molecule attains an average dipole moment of
0.5 D. For ethylene, we identiﬁed conﬁgurations with π-H bonded water molecules, that have rare
four-fold hydrogen-bonded water coordination, yielding instantaneous dipole moments of ethylene
of up to 1 D. The results provide valuable information for the improvement of empirical force ﬁelds,
and point out that for an accurate description of the aqueous solvation of ethanol, and even of the
apolar ethylene, polarizable force ﬁelds are required.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The study of the solvation of alcohols in aqueous so-
lution is of fundamental interest in physics, biology and
chemistry, but also of importance in technical applica-
tions [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. Among the alcohols,
ethanol is one the most well studied compounds. Aque-
ous ethanol solutions are a common in chemical research
and industry applications. Ethanol can be produced by
aqueous hydration of ethylene, that is readily available
from natural sources. This process that can be acceler-
ated by acid catalysis. The reverse route of decomposing
of ethanol into water and ethylene is also of importance.
For example, for developing countries who do not have
a large supply of fossil fuels, dehydration of ethanol ob-
tained from biomass is often the most economical way
to produce ethylene. As is well known, solvation struc-
tures play a crucial role in aqueous solution chemistry,
where reactive events often require a signiﬁcant reorder-
ing of the water molecules in the solvation shell. The
solvation of ethanol and ethylene are therefore crucial in
the course of their (acid-catalyzed) interconversion. The
aqueous solvation of these molecules will be addressed in
the present paper. Elsewhere we report on an ab initio
molecular dynamics study of the acid-catalyzed conver-
sion [12].

Ethanol and ethylene have distinct solvation proper-
ties in aqueous solution. Ethanol is easily soluble as
its polar hydroxyl group can participate in the hydrogen
bonded network and the hydrophobic ethyl group is rel-
atively small. In contrast, the apolar ethylene molecule
has a much weaker interaction with water and is gener-
ally considered to be hydrophobic. Mixtures of water and
ethanol have been studied extensively, both experimen-
tally as by molecular simulation. Experimental studies
employing NMR [13, 14, 15, 16, 17], ultrasonic absorption
[18], infrared absorption spectroscopy [14, 15, 19, 20],
mass spectroscopy [19, 21], X-ray diﬀraction measure-

ments [19, 22], neutron diﬀraction [22, 23, 24], and di-
electric relaxation measurements [25, 26, 27, 28] have
been performed to unravel the solvation properties of
ethanol. Molecular simulation studies using empirical
force ﬁelds have addressed the equation of state, ther-
modynamics, and structure and dynamics of solvation
[29, 30, 31, 32, 33] of aqueous ethanol solutions. The
following general picture of the aqueous solvation in di-
lute solutions has emerged: the hydroxyl group partic-
ipates in the hydrogen bonded network, while the hy-
drophobic alkyl group is accommodated in the hydrogen
bonded network of water molecules. The nature of hy-
dration structure around the hydrophobic part of alco-
hols is still a controversial subject. It has been suggested
[1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10, 16, 17] that hydrophobic solutes enforces
the network of hydrogen bonded water molecules around
it and decreases their mobility, a notion referred to as
hydrophobic hydration [34, 35]. However, recent exper-
imental and computational studies have shown that for
small alcohols the structure and dynamics of the water
molecules in the solvation shell is almost identical to that
of bulk water [23, 24, 31].

Much less is known for the solvation of ethylene in
water under ambient conditions. Experimental [36] and
theoretical [37, 38] work addressed the clathrate hydrates
of ethylene in water. The isolated ethylene-water com-
plex has been a subject of various studies. In the low-
est energy conﬁguration, the ethylene molecule forms a
weak bond with water. An early ab initio study of Del
Bene in 1974 [39] has characterized this interaction as a
π-H hydrogen bond of a water proton with the π elec-
trons of the C=C bond. Several experimental techniques
have been applied to measure the strength of this in-
teraction, such as the matrix isolation study of Engdahl
and Nelander [40, 41], the microwave spectra study of
Andrews and Kuczkowski [42] and the molecular-beam
measurements of Peterson and Klemperer [43]. Recently
[44, 45, 46] and Dupr´e and Yappert
Tarakeshwar et al.

[47] have performed calculations on the ethylene-water
complexes with high level ab initio methods. The inter-
action is weak compared to a hydrogen bonds such as
in the water dimer. The role of the π-H bond in aque-
ous solvation under ambient conditions is still an open
question.

Molecular simulation provides an approach to study
the microscopic behavior of liquids complementary to ex-
perimental studies. All molecular simulations studies of
aqueous ethanol solutions up to now are based on em-
pirical force ﬁelds that are designed to reproduce a selec-
tion of experimental data. Obviously, molecular simula-
tions based on these potentials do not provide a picture
completely independent from experiment. Moreover, the
reliability of the results at conditions that are signiﬁ-
cantly diﬀerent from those where the potential was de-
signed for, may be questionable. Density functional the-
ory (DFT) based molecular dynamics (MD) simulation,
such as the Car-Parrinello molecular dynamics method
[48], where the interactions are calculated by accurate
electronic structure calculations, provides a route to over-
come these limitations. This has been demonstrated in
studies of liquid water [49, 50, 51] and aqueous solva-
tion [52, 53, 54]. Important advantages of DFT-MD over
force-ﬁeld MD are that it intrinsically incorporates polar-
ization, that it accounts for the intra-molecular motion
and therefore allows for a direct comparison with spec-
troscopy of intra-molecular vibrations, and that it yields
detailed information on the electronic properties, such as
the energy levels of electronic states and the charge distri-
bution. In a broader chemical perspective it is important
to note that DFT-MD is capable to study chemical re-
actions in solution, where force-ﬁeld MD would fail com-
pletely as it cannot account for the change in chemical
bonding.

Here, we report on a DFT-based MD simulation of the
solvation of ethanol and ethylene. First we describe the
simulation methods. Then we show results of geometries
and energetics of relevant gas-phase complexes, that will
serve as a validation of the numerical methods employed.
Subsequently, results of structure, dynamics, and polar-
ization of the solvated species will be shown. We conclude
with a discussion.

II. COMPUTATIONAL METHODS

Electronic structure calculations are performed using
the Kohn-Sham [55] formulation of DFT [56]. We em-
ployed the gradient-corrected BLYP functional [57, 58],
that has proven to give a good description of the struc-
ture and dynamics of liquid water [50]. The DFT-based
MD simulations of aqueous ethanol and ethylene are per-
formed using the Car-Parrinello method as implemented
in the CPMD package [59]. Norm-conserving Martins-
Trouillier pseudopotentials [60] are used to restrict the
number of electronic states to those of the valence elec-
trons. Cut-oﬀ radii for H, O and C atoms were chosen

2

to be 0.50, 1.11 and 1.23 a.u., respectively both for the
l=s and l=p terms. The Kohn-Sham orbitals are ex-
panded in a plane wave basis, matching the periodicity
of the periodic box with waves up to a kinetic energy of
70 Ry. With this basis set energies and geometries are
converged within 0.25 kcal/mol and 0.01 ˚A , respectively.
Vibrational frequencies are converged within 1 %, except
for C-O and O-H stretch modes that are underestimated
by 3 % and 5 % compared to the basis set limit values
[53].
In the molecular dynamics calculations, the ﬁcti-
tious mass associated with the plane-wave coeﬃcients is
chosen at 900 a.u., which allowed for a time step in the
numerical integration of the equations-of-motion of 0.145
fs.

To validate the computational approach we compared
CPMD results for energies and structures of relevant
gas-phase molecules and complexes with state-of-the-art
atomic-orbital DFT-BLYP calculations performed with
ADF [61, 62, 63, 64], and other high-level quantum chem-
ical results taken from literature. The gas-phase calcula-
tions with CPMD were performed in a large periodic box
of 10 ˚A using the screening technique of [65] to elimi-
nate the interactions among periodic images. We have
not included zero-point energies in the energies of the
gas-phase compounds. This also holds for computed en-
ergies taken from literature and referred to in the present
paper. This, to ensure a proper comparison between our
results and those from literature.

The MD simulations of the solutions were performed
for a ’small’ and a ’large’ system to asses the ﬁnite size
eﬀects. For the small system a simulation of 10 ps was
performed in a cubic periodic box of length 10.07 ˚A, both
for an ethanol solution of 31 waters and 1 ethanol as for
an ethylene solution of 32 water and 1 ethylene. For the
large system 5 ps simulations were performed using a pe-
riodic box with bcc symmetry and a volume of 1977.6
˚A3. This periodic cell, a truncated octahedron, is in
shape closer to a sphere than a simple cube, and there-
fore better suited for liquid simulation. The large ethanol
solution consisted of 63 waters and 1 ethanol, while the
large ethylene solution consisted of 64 waters and 1 ethy-
lene. The box sizes for both the ethanol and ethylene
solutions were set to match the experimental densities
of the ethanol solutions under ambient conditions. For
the ethylene system this will be slightly larger than the
experimental density, as the eﬀective volume of ethanol
is a bit smaller than the combined volume of ethylene
+ water. However, we do not expect this to give rise
to observable changes in the calculated properties. For
reference we performed 10 ps MD simulations of a sin-
gle ethanol and ethylene in a periodic cubic box of 10
˚A and a pure water systems of 32 water molecules in a
cubic box of 9.85 ˚A for simulation times of 10 ps. For all
simulations there was an initial equilibration trajectory
of 1 ps. Temperature was controlled by a Nos´e-Hoover
thermostat [66, 67, 68] and ﬁxed at 300 K.

III. GAS-PHASE COMPLEXES

The ethanol monomer has two stable conformers very
close in energy, the symmetric trans structure and the
a-symmetric gauche structure (see ﬁg. 1). The main dis-
tinction is the orientation of the OH bond with respect
to the CCO plane. A microwave study [69] has shown
that the trans form is slightly (0.12 kcal/mol) more sta-
ble than the gauche form. Table I lists the most impor-
tant geometric data of the trans and gauche conform-
ers, and compares the CPMD results with ADF calcu-
lations, B3LYP calculations [70], and experimental data
[71]. CPMD and ADF bond lengths diﬀer at most 0.01
˚A and angles are within 0.5o. Comparing CPMD with
B3LYP and experimental values yields diﬀerences upto
0.03 ˚A and 0.5o, and 0.04 ˚A and 1o respectively. The
calculated energy diﬀerence between the two conformers
is listed in ﬁg. 2. CPMD, ADF, B3LYP of Ref. [72], and
MP4 [73] predict the trans conformer to be stable by
0.07-0.10 kcal/mol, in good agreement with the experi-
mental value of 0.12 kcal/mol. In contrast, the B3LYP
calculation of [70] yields the opposite, with the gauche
conformer stable by 0.23 kcal/mol. Vibrational frequen-
cies obtained by a Fourier transform of the velocity auto
correlation function (VACF) of a single ethanol at 300 K
yields an OH stretch frequency of 3200 cm−1 and a CH
stretch frequencies in the range of 2600-2800 cm−1. This
should be compared to the experimental values of 3653
cm−1 [72], and 2800-3000 cm−1 [19, 72], respectively.
The tendency of BLYP to underestimate frequencies by
≈ 10% is a known feature, and also observed in BLYP
calculations of water [50] and methanol [53].

For the ethanol-water complex we distinguished four
complexes, with both the ethanol trans and gauche con-
former acting as proton donor or acceptor in the hydro-
gen bond with water. Table II lists the most important
geometric data obtained with CPMD and ADF. Fig. 2
shows the energy diﬀerences for all complexes. As for
the ethanol monomer there is excellent agreement be-
tween CPMD and ADF results, with deviations within
0.02 ˚A and 2o for bond lengths and angles, and the bind-
ing energies within 0.2 kcal/mol. This indicates a state-
of-the art accuracy of the electronic-structure method
employed in CPMD. The CPMD-BLYP calculation pre-
dicts the complex with the water molecule donating a
proton to the ethanol gauche conformer to be the most
stable, with a binding energy relative to the isolated wa-
ter and trans ethanol conformer of 4.75 kcal/mol. The
complex with the ethanol trans conformer donating a
proton is less stable by 0.82 kcal/mol. Switching to the
other ethanol conformer within either complex destabi-
lizes the complex by 0.07 and 0.4 kcal/mol, respectively.
The relative stability of the ethanol donor and acceptor
complexes is similar to that for the methanol-water com-
plex where CPMD-BLYP [53] and the complete-basis-set
MP2 estimate [74] yields the methanol acceptor complex
stable by 0.74 and 0.35 kcal/mol, respectively. There are
no experimental data for the structure and energetics of

3

the ethanol-water dimer. The MP2 result of Ref. [75]
provides the only high-level quantum mechanical study
reported in literature. This study does not distinguish
between the trans and gauche conformers. Therefore, a
comparison with our results is somewhat limited. For
the ethanol acceptor conﬁguration the MP2 and CPMD-
BLYP result for the complexation energy are similar.
However, for the ethanol donor conﬁguration the MP2
complexation energy is more than 1.3 kcal/mol larger
than the CPMD-BLYP results. Consequently, the MP2
calculations yield an opposite relative stability of the two
water-ethanol conﬁgurations, with an energy diﬀerence of
0.92 kcal/mol. It should be noted that in the same study
the methanol-water complex with the methanol as hydro-
gen bond donor is found to be the most stable, in contra-
diction with the MP2 basis-set limit result of Ref. [74].
This suggests that in the Ref. [75] a limited basis set
or other factors could have lead to spurious reversal of
the relative stability of the two water-ethanol conﬁgu-
rations. The CPMD-BLYP hydrogen bond interaction
energy for the ethanol-water dimer is of the same order
of magnitude as the CPMD-BLYP result for the water-
water [50], water-methanol [53], and methanol-methanol
[76] dimer. Comparison of these three dimers against
high-level quantum chemical calculations and experimen-
tal values indicates that BLYP underestimates the bind-
ing energy by approximately 1 kcal/mol. For the ethanol-
water dimer we could expect a similar diﬀerence. Here
we should add that going from water, via methanol, to
ethanol the dispersion forces become increasingly impor-
tant. These are not accounted for in gradient-corrected
functionals such as BLYP. Correlated methods such MP2
incorporate, to a good approximation, dispersion forces.
In Ref. [76] we estimated, in a comparison of BLYP and
high-level MP2 calculations [77] for the methanol-dimer
in non-hydrogen bonded conﬁgurations, that the absence
of dispersion interaction in BLYP amounted to an under-
estimate of the binding energy of ≈1 kcal/mol. For the
ethanol-water dimer this number could serve as an un-
derestimate. Yet, although by far no insigniﬁcant, the
magnitude of the deviation is much smaller than the
hydrogen-bond interaction. Therefore, it can be argued
that for a study of aqueous ethanol neglecting the dis-
persion interaction is acceptable.

Next we discuss the ethylene-water complexes. We
will consider complexes with a single water and a wa-
ter dimer. The dominant interaction of water with ethy-
lene is a π-H bond, where a proton of the water molecule
binds to π electrons of the double C=C bond. There ex-
ist two stable complexes between ethylene and a single
water molecule, indicated as the EW1a and EW1b ge-
ometry (see ﬁg. 3). Both geometries have Cs symmetry
with the plane of the water molecule orthogonal to that
of ethylene molecule. In the EW1a structure the water-
plane is parallel to the C=C bond, whereas in EW1b it
is orthogonal. In table III we compare the CPMD-BLYP
geometries with ADF-BLYP and MP2[44, 47] and CCSD
[46] results. Fig. 2 shows the energy diﬀerences, and

compares these to values reported in literature. Again
the CPMD and ADF results are in excellent agreement,
with energies smaller than 0.02 kcal/mol, and geome-
tries within 0.01 ˚A and 0.3◦, except for the non bonded
OHnb distance that is related to water orientation, a co-
ordinate along with the energy surface is relatively ﬂat.
The BLYP result shows a signiﬁcant π-H binding en-
ergy of ≈ 1.4 kcal/mol. However, in MP2 [44, 46, 47]
and CCSD [46] calculations, binding energies are ≈ 1-
2 kcal/mol stronger, accompanied by a shorter π-H bond
with diﬀerences of 0.12 ˚A and 0.14 ˚A for EW1a and
EW1b, respectively. The comparison with the experi-
mental value gives a similar picture with the BLYP un-
derestimating the binding energy ≈ 2 kcal/mol.

Matrix isolation studies[40, 41] have revealed that the
complex of ethylene with two water molecules consists of
a water dimer that has one water molecule π-H bonded
to the C=C double bond. Recent high-level MP2 calcula-
tions have indicated that the presence of the second water
molecule enhances the strength of the π-H bond[45, 47].
From ﬁg. 2 we see that BLYP result are qualitatively
in line with this observation, with a binding energy of
the (water-dimer)-ethylene complex of 2.25 kcal/mol, up
from 1.41 kcal/mol for the single-water binding. How-
ever, quantitatively MP2 and BLYP compare less well,
with BLYP underestimating both the total binding en-
ergy as well as the increase from the single-water bind-
ing. Again, the experimental value[40, 41], that is closer
to the MP2 result, shows a signiﬁcantly stronger binding
than BLYP. Both for the water-ethylene and the (water-
dimer)-ethylene complex the diﬀerences of BLYP with
MP2 and experiment are signiﬁcant relative to the total
binding energy. This absence of dispersion interaction in
BLYP will be an important factor contribution to this
discrepancy.

Overall, we conclude that the reference calculations
provide conﬁdence that BLYP is capable of a quantita-
tive study of a the aqueous solvation of a single ethanol
molecule where interactions are dominated by relatively
strong hydrogen bonds. BLYP qualitatively accounts
for the weaker π-H binding in water-ethylene systems.
However, comparison with MP2 and experimental data
suggest that its strength is signiﬁcantly underestimated.
Yet, for a single solvated ethylene the hydrogen bonds
among the solvating water molecules will be the domi-
nant interaction. Hence, we believe that BLYP will be
able to quantitative described dilute aqueous ethylene
solution. Both for ethanol and ethylene the absence of
dispersion attraction in BLYP will have some impact, in
particular for the coordination around the CH2 and CH3
groups, where BLYP only accounts for the steric repul-
sion.

IV. SOLVATION STRUCTURE

A. Ethanol Solvation

Fig. 4 shows ethanol-water radial distribution func-
tions (RDFs) of the small and large ethanol solutions.
The pronounced structure in the hydrogen bonding RDFs
(HH, OH, HO, OO) are a clear indication of the presence
of hydrogen bonds. All RDFs show that the small sys-
tem gives a good description of the ﬁrst solvation shell,
while the large system also includes the second solva-
tion shell. The peak positions of the force-ﬁeld simu-
lations of Fidler and Rodger [31], indicated by crosses,
are close to our results. Note that the good agree-
ment for the CO RDFs, that are potentially sensitive
to a proper description of the dispersion attraction, sug-
gests that the absence of the dispersion interaction in our
CPMD-BLYP simulation is of limited importance for a
proper description of the aqueous solvation of the hy-
drophobic group of ethanol. The position of the ﬁrst
peak of the OH- and HO-RDF indicates that the average
hydrogen-bond length is 1.7 ˚A for both the ethanol-
donor and -acceptor bond. Integration of the OO-RDF
upto the ﬁrst minimum r = 3.3 ˚A yields on average 3 wa-
ter molecules in the ﬁrst solvation shell of the hydroxyl
group, in good agreement with the neutron diﬀraction
value of ≈ 3 [24] . Integrating the methyl-oxygen (C2O)
RDF up to r = 5.7 ˚A indicates that the ﬁrst solvation
shell of the methyl group consists of approximately 21
water molecules. These coordination numbers are of the
same order as the experimental estimation of Petrillo et
al. [22], who found that there are 18 ± 2 water molecules
within 4 ˚A from the center-of-mass of an ethanol in aque-
ous solution.

B. Ethylene solvation

In ﬁg. 5 we show the ethylene-water RDFs of the small
and large ethylene solution. Both the carbon-oxygen and
the intermolecular carbon-hydrogen RDFs are shown.
Experimental or simulation data for ethylene in aqueous
solution at room temperature were not available. The
comparison between the small and large system shows a
larger deviation in the ﬁrst solvation shell than was found
for the ethanol solutions. Apparently, the small ethylene
system is not able to accommodate properly the ﬁrst sol-
vation shell. Integration the CO-RDF of the large system
up to the ﬁrst minimum at 5.7 ˚A yields a hydration shell
of 23 water molecules. More spatial information can be
extracted from ﬁg. 6 where, for the large system, the
distribution of water H-atoms around the ethylene C=C
axis is shown. X and Y are the components of the vec-
tor joining a water hydrogen and the midpoint of the
C=C bond. Here, X is the distance orthogonal to the
C=C axis and Y the parallel distance. Note that we
used the four-fold symmetry to improve the statistical
accuracy yielding four identical quadrants. The ethylene

hydrogens are shown to visualize the size of the ethy-
lene molecule, but do not indicate any angle dependence
around the C=C axis. The ﬁgure shows a well deﬁned
elliptic region with no hydrogens present except for two
weak, but clearly visible, peaks in the mid plane Y = 0
at X = ±2.5. These should be attributed to the presence
of π − H bonded conﬁgurations.

C. Water Structure

In ﬁg. 7 the calculated water oxygen-oxygen RDFs of
both the ethanol and the ethylene solutions are compared
to those calculated for pure water. Note that the ﬁrst
solvation shell contains a large fraction of the total num-
ber of water molecules, especially for the small system.
Structural changes due to the solute molecule should
therefore be detectable by comparing these systems with
the pure water system. For the ethanol solution we see
a small drop of the ﬁrst peak accompanied by a slight
increase at the ﬁrst minimum. This indicates some de-
crease in the hydrogen-bond structure, when compared
to the pure water. As the small ethylene-water solu-
tion is too small to accommodate a fully relaxed water
solvation shell ﬁg. 7 only shows the RDFs of the large
ethylene system. The RDFs show a similar behavior as
for the ethanol solvation, with a slight decrease of the
ﬁrst peak and a small increase of the RDF in the re-
gion around the ﬁrst minimum. The small changes in
the structure of the solvating water shell around ethanol
and ethylene indicate that the hydrogen-bonded water
network is very ﬂexible and can easily open up to accom-
modate small apolar solute groups without signiﬁcantly
changing its structure. Our ﬁndings are consistent with
the neutron diﬀraction experiments of Turner and Soper
[23] and force-ﬁeld molecular dynamics simulation of Fi-
dler and Rodger [31] who also did not ﬁnd any evidence of
structural enhancement in the hydration shell of ethanol.
Turner and Soper found that only for larger hydropho-
bic solutes this eﬀect was experimentally detectable, but
even then very small. The same trend was found for in a
CPMD-BLYP molecular dynamics study of the solvation
of methanol [53].

D. Hydrogen Bonds

5

we found that methanol in a dilute aqueous solution do-
nates on average 0.9 hydrogen bonds and accepts 1.5
[53]. ¿From the pure water simulation these numbers
were measured to be 1.7.

For the ethylene molecule a well deﬁned deﬁnition for
the π-H hydrogen bond does not exist. To investigate
the inﬂuence of the π-H hydrogen bond on the solva-
tion structure we looked at the water hydrogen positions
relative to the C=C axis (see ﬁg 6). Inside the elliptic re-
gion around the C=C bond that is depleted of hydrogens
we clearly detect near the center-of-mass of the ethylene
molecule at a distance of ≈ 2.5 ˚A a region with an in-
creased amount of water hydrogens. Integration over this
region with 0 < X < 2.6 and 0 < Y < 1 yields a value of
0.42. This implies that approximately 40% of the time
a water molecule is oriented towards the double bond,
forming a π-H bond.

V. SOLUTE DYNAMICS

The time scale of the present simulations (5-10 ps)
allows for an analysis of the short-time dynamics. As
we mentioned above BLYP underestimates most vibra-
tional frequencies by more than 10 %. However, the fre-
quency shifts upon solvation still provide valuable infor-
mation and allow for a direct comparison to experiments.
Fig. 8 shows the spectrum of the velocity auto correla-
tion functions (VACFs) of the ethanol hydroxyl hydrogen
for the large ethanol solution and for the single isolated
ethanol. The spectrum is of limited accuracy due to the
relative short trajectory. However, the calculations show
that, upon solvation, there is a clear red shift of about
200 cm−1 of the OH stretch frequency. Experimental
data for the OH frequency shift of ethanol in dilute aque-
ous solution is not available. However, the OH red shift
is a typical characteristic of a hydrogen bonded liquid. A
comparison with measured shifts in liquid ethanol, from
3676 cm−1[79] to 3330 cm−1[80], shows a similar trend.
In a CPMD-BLYP simulation of a dilute aqueous solution
of methanol we found a similar red shift for the methanol
OH frequency of about 200 cm−1

[78]:

To examine the hydrogen bond statistics in the ethanol
solution we adopted the deﬁnition of Ref.
two
molecules are hydrogen bonded if simultaneously the
inter-oxygen distance is less than 3.4 ˚A and the OHO
angle is smaller than 30◦. With this deﬁnition we found
that, for the large system, ethanol oxygen donates on
average 0.9 hydrogen bonds and accepts 1.7. For the
small system we found 1.0 and 1.6, respectively. This in
consistent with the fact that approximately three water
molecules occupy the ﬁrst solvation shell of the hydroxyl
group. For comparison, in a CPMD-BLYP simulation

The vibrational spectrum of the VACF of the ethylene
molecule is not shown. As for the ethanol system there
was a limited accuracy due to the relatively short calcu-
lated trajectory. We observed that upon solvation the CH
and CC peaks do broaden. However an estimate for peak
shift falls outside the accuracy of the calculated spectra.
The matrix isolation studies of Engdahl and Nelander
[40, 41] show minor changes in frequencies when isolated
ethylene is compared with the ethylene-water complex,
with the largest shift being a blue shift of 12 cm−1 of the
out-of-plane bending mode (ν7 ≈ 947 cm−1).

VI. POLARIZATION

As the electronic structure is an intrinsic part of a
CPMD simulation, detailed information about the elec-
tronic charge distribution can be obtained. To quan-
tify the charge distribution we used the method of max-
imally localized Wannier functions that transforms the
Kohn-Sham orbitals into Wannier functions, whose cen-
ters (WFC) can be assigned a chemical meaning such as

termine the dipole moment of individual molecules in a
condensed phase by assuming the electronic charge to be
distributed as point charges located on the WFCs.

Table IV list the calculated dipole moments for the
gas-phase systems and the average dipole moment for
the solvated systems. The latter were obtained from 28
independent conﬁgurations of the small solvated systems.
The distributions of these dipole moments are shown in
ﬁg. 9. For ethanol we observe an signiﬁcant increase in
going from the gas-phase molecule via the water-ethanol
cluster to the fully solvated system. This trend is very
similar to what is found is found for water [83, 84] and
methanol [76] and may be considered typical feature of
a strongly hydrogen bonding molecule. The calculated
distribution of dipole moments of solvated ethanol shows
that thermally driven ﬂuctuations give rise to a signiﬁ-
cant variation ranging from 2.0 D to 4.0 D.

Also for ethylene we observed a signiﬁcant change of
the dipole moment upon solvation. Being apolar in the
gas phase, the average dipole moment increases up to
0.5 D when complexed with the water dimer or when in
solution. In solution it exhibits rare ﬂuctuations where
the dipole moment reaches values of up to 1.0 D. Fig. 10
shows a typical snapshot where such an extreme high
value of the dipole moment is reached. The two WFCs
of the ethylene double bond are located near the mid-
dle of the C=C bond, just below and above the plane
of the molecule.
In the ﬁgure we see clearly that the
upper π-WFC is acting as proton acceptor. The π-H
bond shifts this WFC further out of plane inducing an
ethylene dipole moment orthogonal to the plane of the
molecule. The snapshot suggests an enhancement of the
ethylene polarization by the fact that the π-H bonded wa-
ter molecule has in turn a rare four-fold hydrogen-bonded
water coordination, with three of the waters donating a
proton. This should be seen as a manifestation of the
strengthening of the π-H bond upon complexing water
molecules with the water molecule that is π-H bonded to
the ethylene, a feature found in gas-phase MP2 calcula-
tions [45, 47] and also in the present BLYP calculations,
and discussed above in section III.

VII. CONCLUSIONS

We have studied the solvation of ethanol and ethylene
in water by DFT-based (Car-Parrinello) Molecular Dy-

6

namics. Validation of the computational approach by
comparing structure and energetics of relevant gas-phase
complexes against experimental results and state of the
art quantum chemical calculations showed that CPMD
employing the DFT-BLYP is capable of qualitatively de-
scribing the aqueous solvation of a single ethanol of ethy-
lene molecule.

The structural properties of the ethanol solvation were
in good agreement with both neutron diﬀraction data
[23] and force-ﬁeld MD simulations [31]. We found that in
aqueous solution ethanol accepts on average 1.7 hydrogen
bonds and donates on average 0.9 hydrogen bonds. For
ethylene we found it has approximately 0.4 π-H bonds
with a water molecule. Both for ethanol and ethylene
the simulations provided no structural evidence for hy-
drophobic hydration: the structure of the hydrating wa-
ter shell was not enhanced compared to that of pure wa-
ter. The calculation even indicated a slight decrease in
the structure. For aqueous ethanol the calculated red
shift of the hydroxyl vibration upon solvation was con-
sistent with experimental ﬁndings.

Analysis of the electronic charge distribution by means
of Wannier functions showed that the interaction with
water can signiﬁcantly increase the dipole moment of
the ethanol and the ethylene molecule. The average
dipole moment of ethanol increases from 1.8 D in the
gas phase to 3.1 D in aqueous solution. Ethylene, that
is apolar in the gas phase, attains an average dipole mo-
ment of 0.5 D in solution. We identiﬁed conﬁgurations,
with a π-H bonded water molecule that has a rare four-
fold hydrogen-bonded water coordination, where the in-
stantaneous dipole moment of ethylene takes values of
up to 1 D. Such conﬁgurations with large solute dipole
moments may also play an important role in activating
chemical reactions involving the solutes as we have seen
in a CPMD-BLYP study of the acid-catalyzed hydra-
tion of ethene [12]. The strong polarization eﬀect raises
questions towards the common consideration of think-
ing ethylene as a apolar and hydrophobic molecule. The
electronic charge analysis also points out the necessity
of polarizable force ﬁelds for both ethanol and ethylene
when dissolved in water. The present results may be
considered valuable for the design of such force-ﬁelds.

[44], g: MP2/6-311+G(2d,2p) [47], h: CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVDZ [46], i: Matrix isolation study [41], j: MP2/aug-cc-pVDZ [45],
and k: Matrix isolation study [40]. For (e), (f), (g), and (h) we gave the BSSE-corrected (lowest value) and the non-BSSE
corrected values (highest value). (i) and (k) are the experimental values minus the ZPE of [47].

FIG. 4: Ethanol-water RDFs of the ethanol solutions. All insets show both the results of the small (solid line) and the large
system (dashed line). For all graphs gAB indicates that the ﬁrst atom A belongs to ethanol and the second atom B belongs to
water. If the ﬁrst is a hydrogen, A=H, then always the hydroxyl hydrogen of the ethanol is meant. C1 is the carbon bonded
to the hydroxyl group, C2 is the carbon of the methyl group.

FIG. 6: Time and rotational averaged normalized density distribution ρ(r)/ρ0 (with ρ0 is the average hydrogen density) of
the water-hydrogens around the solvated ethylene molecule obtained from the large system simulation. The rotational average
is about the C=C axis. The four-fold symmetry is imposed so that all quadrants contain the same information. The density
regions 1.0 < ρ(r)/ρ0 < 2.0 and ρ(r)/ρ0 > 2.0 are illustrated by small and large pixels, respectively.

FIG. 10: A snapshot of ethylene solvated in water. The ﬁgure shows a rare conﬁguration where the ethylene molecule has a
large dipole moment of ≈ 1 D. For clarity, only the ethylene molecule and ﬁve water molecules are shown. Carbon and oxygens
are dark grey. Hydrogens are light grey. Besides the atoms also the WCFs are shown (middle grey). The water molecules have
WFCs in both OH bonds and two aside the oxygen corresponding to the lone pairs. Ethylene has four WFCs along the CH
bonds and two out-of-plane WFCs between the carbons corresponding to the π bond. The dashed lines indicate the hydrogen
bonds. One the protons of the central water molecules points towards the ’upper’ π bond WFC. This is the manifestation of
the π-H bond in this picture.

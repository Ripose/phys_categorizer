Abstract:

The method for determination the microscopic surface tension σ(R) of nanobubbles is developed

based on the new elaboration of the positronium bubble model. In contrast to existing structureless

Ps bubble models, our version contains experimentally known molecular characteristics of liquids.

The relationship, similar to Tolman’s equation, between σ(R) and the radius R of the Ps bubble

is derived on a microscopic basis. Numerical values for σ(R) are determined for a large number

of liquids and liquiﬁed gases. The results are in agreement with the theoretical expectations and

independent evaluations, available in literature.

Keywords: surface tension, positronium, nanobubbles, interphase boundary, cavity forma-

I. INTRODUCTION

More than one hundred years ago Willard Gibbs in the frameworks of thermodynamic approach

established that if the surface of a liquid is curved, the surface tension coeﬃcient σ gets a function

of curvature 1/r of the interphase boundary. Investigations of Gibbs were extended by Tolman

[1] and others [2,3]. It was found that behavior of σ(r) for droplets and bubbles is diﬀerent. For

droplets σ(r) is approximately described by Tolman’s equation:

σ(r) =

σ
∞
1 + 2∆/r

,

(1.1)

where σ

is the tension for a plane surface and the ”Tolman distance” ∆ is equal to the distance

∞

between the equimolecular dividing surface and the surface of tension.

In case of bubbles σ(r) may pass through a maximum [3] and than goes to zero, but in both

cases at small r σ(r) ∝ r [4]. Special additional assumptions are made concerning the behavior

of the Tolman parameter ∆ as a function of r [3].

However applicability of the thermodynamic approach to very small systems such as liquid

droplets in the gas phase or bubbles in liquids remains questionable [4]. Basic equations hold for

systems with large number of molecules. Besides it remains unclear how to relate locations of the

dividing surface and the surface of tension to actual positions of molecules for nanosized voids and

droplets. For this we need the microscopical theory of the surface tension.

The problem is intricate because experimental veriﬁcation of the theoretical assumptions made

is practically impossible. Traditional techniques of surface tension measurements are not sensitive

to the deviations of the microscopic surface tension at small r from the macroscopic one. Some-

times the problem is masked by non-equilibrium properties of the surface formed, which depend

on its ”age” (so-called dynamical surface tension).

Solvophobic property of the positronium (Ps) atom, i.e.

its ability to form a nanobubble in

liquid, makes it very attractive probe for investigation of the possible dependence of σ(r) [5,6].

Recently we suggested new approach for determination of the microscopic surface tension in liquids

using positron spectroscopy data [7,8]. Combining the data on the ortho-Ps lifetime and width of

the ”narrow” component of the ACAR (angular correlation of annihilation radiation) spectrum in

the same liquid it is possible to extract parameters of the Ps bubble. Finally energy minimization

condition allows to determine respective microscopic surface tension.

In this paper we present detailed description of the Ps bubble model suggested in [8] and

modiﬁcation of the method of determination of the microscopic surface tension.

Before starting the explanation of the subject we shell brieﬂy remind the basis of the positron

spectroscopy to introduce terms which will be used below.

II. POSITRON ANNIHILATION IN MATTER

The nonrelativistic approximation in QED gives the following expression for the spin-averaged

probability per second for the annihilation of a positron-electron pair into two photons, for which

the sum of the wave vectors k = k1 + k2 is within d

III. PS BUBBLE MODEL

A. Historical outlook

In 1957 Ferrel [11] suggested positronium in a liquid creates a nanocavity (bubble), repelling

neighboring molecules outward. It happens because of a strong exchange repulsion between the

electron, composing Ps atom, and electrons of host molecules. It was the onset of the Ps bubble

model. Its two main aims are the calculation of the lifetime of the ortho-positronium (o-Ps) and

calculation of the shape of the angular correlation of annihilation radiation (ACAR) spectrum,

strictly speaking its ”narrow component”, which corresponds to intrinsic 2γ-annihilation of para-

positronium (p-Ps).

Residence of the p-Ps in a bubble practically does not change its lifetime.

It is too short

because of prompt intrinsic 2γ-annihilation. The situation is very diﬀerent for the o-Ps state.

Because of a restriction imposed by angular momentum conservation 2γ-decay mode is forbidden

for o-Ps. Thus its most probable decay channel in vacuum is 3γ-annihilation. That is why o-Ps

lifetime gets approximately 1000 times as large than of p-Ps one and constitutes 142 ns in vacuum.

However in matter o-Ps may participate in another annihilation process. It is so-called pick-oﬀ

process when e+ annihilates into 2γ with an electron of the opposite spin, belonging to surrounding

molecules. Usually pick-oﬀ annihilation shortens o-Ps lifetime down to several nanoseconds.

To account the pick-oﬀ annihilation process Tao modiﬁed Ferrel’s model suggesting existence

of an electronic layer inside the well, close to its boundary. Within the model, which uses an

inﬁnite spherically symmetrical potential well for simulation of the Ps bubble, introduction of

such a layer is a unique way to account for the overlapping of the positron and external electrons,

which is responsible for the pick-oﬀ process. Because of simplicity and physical transparency this

model became very popular [12].

By the end of the 50’s Stewart and Briscoe [13] and Roellig [14] introduced potential well of a

ﬁnite height for more adequate simulation of the trapping potential of the Ps bubble. Their model

came to present time practically without modiﬁcations. Its basis is the following [12]. Ps atom

is considered as a point quantum particle, which is self-trapped in a spherical free-volume cavity.

Action of the surrounding molecules on the Ps is taken into account via an external potential,

which is simulated by a spherical rectangular potential well with the depth U and radius RU .

A liquid is considered as a structureless continuum. Almost in all cases the energy of bubble

formation is reduced to the surface energy, which is attributed to the interphase boundary. It is

important that the position of this boundary is also associated with the location of potential well,

i.e. with RU . So the bubble formation energy is written as 4πR2

. In calculation of the pick-oﬀ

U σ

∞

annihilation rate it is assumed that external host electrons do not presented inside the potential

well and o-Ps pick-oﬀ annihilation proceeds only due to overlapping of the o-Ps wave function

with the electrons of a medium outside the boundary of the well.

B. Smooth potentials and concept of average density

Recently in [15,16,17] the smooth potentials like U tanh2(r/RU ) and U(1 − e−

r/RU ) were used

instead of the sharp ﬁnite well potential. With this the authors tried to take into account the

smooth variation of the density of medium from the center of the bubble towards the bulk of the

liquid. Application of these potentials is based on a possibility to obtain analytical expression for

the Ps wave function and the energy of the Ps ground state.

However we think that this concept of the ”average” density proﬁle in the problem of positro-

nium formation is not well justiﬁed. One may admit that during the bubble formation stage the

isolated molecules (so to say a ”vapor phase”) may exists inside a ”pre-bubble”. But we can not

take their presence into account in terms of smooth density distribution (and smooth potential).

Ps motion is much faster then that of molecules and Ps wave function easily tunes up to cur-

rent positions of molecules. Ps wave function goes to zero inside the molecules because of strong

exchange and coulombic repulsion. Such a behavior of the wave function increases Ps kinetic

energy (zero-point energy) and ﬁnally promotes pushing all the molecules out of the cavity to

the boundary of the Ps bubble. In contrast to empty bubbles (no Ps inside), the equilibrium Ps

bubble does not contain the ”vapor phase”. Presence of the light quantum particle in the bubble

leads to the much more abrupt density proﬁle on the boundary of the Ps bubble. Only in this

case the usage of the bell-like Ps wave function (similar to that in Eq.(3.1)) is meaningful. We

conclude that structure of the interphase region of the Ps bubble is diﬀerent from that of usual

vapor-liquid boundary.

Obviously smooth Ps wave function is not good approximation outside the bubble. Self-

consistent results should correspond to a rather small penetration of the Ps wave function to the

bulk of a liquid. As we shell see below the results obtained on the basis of the present model are

well-matched with this requirement.

Of course the Woods-Saxon potential is suitable for smoothing the sharp edge of the potential

of the rectangular wall [18]. In the most realistic case a ≪ RU (a is the third parameter (beyond

RU and U) entering the Woods-Saxon function) the potential approaches to the square well shape

and the results of the ﬁtting of experimental data using these two potentials should be similar.

C. General comments about modiﬁcations of the Ps bubble model

Basing on the above comments, we adopt here the potential of the ﬁnite spherically-

symmetrical rectangular well for simulation of the Ps bubble, but introduce additional speciﬁ-

cations to make the bubble model more realistic.

As we have seen in the standard model [12,13,14] RU is overloaded by diﬀerent physical mean-

ings. It determines the position of the potential well, which conﬁnes Ps in the bubble. At the

same time RU determines the bubble formation energy, 4πR2

. RU is also related to the pick-oﬀ

U σ

∞

annihilation rate of Ps. It is clear that description of these eﬀects having such a diﬀerent physical

nature by means of one parameter is very crude. So we attempt to split theses eﬀects, introducing

additional parameters. Below we reserve for RU the meaning of the position of the potential wall

only (Fig.1).

How do calculate the energy of the bubble formation? It is an important question for the Ps

bubble model. In section 5 we shell see that the naive estimation 4πR2

for the surface energy

U σ

∞

contribution is not correct. Position of the potential wall responsible for ”reﬂection” of the Ps

into the bubble and position of the surface of tension, related to intermolecular interaction, are

diﬀerent. They are placed on diﬀerent distances from the center of the bubble. Approximating

molecules by spheres interacting with each other by means of ”central” forces, it seems reasonable

to identify the surface of tension with the sphere SR+RWS passing through the centers of molecules

residing on the ﬁrst molecular layer of the interphase boundary (Fig.1). Here R is the radius of

a free-volume and RWS is the Wigner-Seitz radius ( 4

3πR3

WS = 1/n).2 In typical Ps bubbles the

diﬀerence between R and R + RWS is important for estimation of the surface energy. This problem

will be discussed in Section 4 in more details.

To calculate the o-Ps lifetime we need to know distribution of the electronic density close to the

boundary of the Ps bubble. Depending on U and RU , e+ may penetrate in some extent through

the nearest molecules (bubble boundary) into the bulk of the liquid. At the same time electrons

belonging to the nearest molecules may reside inside the potential well. Thus, electronic density

proﬁle and that of the potential, localizing Ps, should not coincide. Our approach explicitly takes

into to account penetration of outer electrons into the bubble through the parameter δ (Fig. 1).

It leads to additional pick-oﬀ annihilation within the layer of the thickness δ close to SRU -sphere,

but inside it.3

It is worth noting that this circumstance allows to reproduce standard inﬁnite

potential well bubble model as a limiting case U → ∞ of our approach.

D. ortho-Ps lifetime

By the end of bubble formation (when all the molecules of the ”vapor phase” are pushed out

to the bubble boundary) the Ps center-of-mass wave function takes the form

2If molecules are not spherical, but rather elongated, it could be reasonable to approximate them as a

sequence of spherical fragments. In this case 4

3 πR3

WS takes sense of the volume of the fragment.

3Of course there are some other reasons, which could lead to deviation between density and potential

proﬁles. For example, approaching to the boundary of the bubble one may expect small deepening of

the potential due to polarization interaction as was discussed by Chuang and Tao [19] in application to

silicagel powders. We neglect such eﬀects here.

of host electrons which may form such a zero-spin pair is 4 times less. Thus, these eﬀects cancel each

Ps is usually identiﬁed with the positronium spin-averaged lifetime 0.5 ns. The inﬁnite

potential well approach is very popular because of its simplicity. Knowing experimental value

of the o-Ps lifetime and calculating RU from the ACAR data (Eq.(3.21)), Eq.(3.9) may give an

information about δ.

In the ﬁnite potential well model we suggest to deﬁne parameter δ in the following way. It was

noted by Kobayashi [20], that if in Eq.(3.9) the free-volume radius R = RU − δ tends to zero and
δ = 1.66 ˚A, the energy of the Ps ground state gets equal to the Ps binding energy in vacuum (6.8

eV). It indicates that Ps may not exist without the free volume. Generalization of this hypothesis

for the case of the ﬁnite well is the following: when R → 0 or RU → δ, the Ps bound state escapes

from the potential well. It leads to the following relationship between U and δ:

U = E

remain bound due to the long-rage Coulombic interaction, but their binding energy will be small

and the average e+-e− distance becomes larger than intermolecular distance. It is the quasi-free

positronium in matter. Sometimes it is called as the swollen Ps. Electron density of the ”own”

electron on the positron in such a state is small in comparison with the other electrons. So,

positron annihilation will look like the free e+ annihilation.

Combination of Eq.(3.10) and Eq.(3.4) gives

kU δ =

sin kU RU .

π

(3.11)

This relationship essentially simpliﬁes our approach, because now PR becomes a function of the

parameter kU RU only. Thus, knowing o-Ps lifetime we can directly obtain kU RU . However,

an additional information is needed to obtain RU and kU separately. For this purpose ACAR-

spectroscopy data will be used.

E. Narrow component of ACAR spectra

The distribution of annihilating photons over kz is measured by means of the long-slit angu-

lar correlation e+ annihilation apparatus. The most reliable information about the Ps state in

the bubble is obtained from the shape of the narrow component of the ACAR spectra, which

corresponds to intrinsic annihilation of the p-Ps:

Usually for extraction of the narrow component from the total ACAR spectrum it is decom-

posed into a set of gaussians. To visualize uncertainty which comes from neglecting deviation

in shape between Eq.(3.16) and the gaussian with the same ΘFWHM, in Fig.2 we plotted several

spectra for diﬀerent Ps traps. For rather ”deep” well (kU RU ≥ 2.5) the diﬀerence is not large, but

for ”shallow” traps (kU RU ≤ 2.5) this deviation should be taken in to account in decomposition

of the ACAR spectrum.

1/3. We shall consider molecules as semi-hard spheres of radius ¯r/2 with only nearest

neighbor interactions (ϕLJ approaches zero very rapidly with increasing r).

Since the energy required to form a surface arises from the decrease in number of bonds of

molecules at the boundary, the accompanying decrement in coordination number, ν, needs to be

estimated. The bulk liquid we imagine as a closely packed structure. Everywhere in it one may

ﬁnd four nearest molecules, which form a regular tetrahedron of edge length ¯r, whose centers lie on

a sphere Sr1 of radius r1 = ¯r

3/8 (Fig.3). Therefore, the area per molecule on Sr1 is 1

In what follows we neglect the diﬀerence between r1 and the Wigner-Seitz radius because it may

be seen that r1 =

8RWS = 0.986RWS. Hence for all practical purposes we may take
that the volume of the sphere Sr1 of the closest neighbors to have the same volume as the average

volume per molecule in the liquid or, in other words, r1 ≈ RWS.

Next permit the positronium to create a spherical free volume 4πR3/3 (or bubble) of radius

R inside the tetrahedron and thereby pushing the molecules outward. The other molecules also

rearrange themselves to settle on the ﬁrst molecular layer (FML) of radius r1 + R, Fig.4. The

number NFML of molecules lying on this layer can be estimated from its area, 4π(r1 + R)2, dividing

by the area per molecule, πr2

NFML =

(4.3)

Because of formation of the bubble with the free volume 4πR3/3 the coordination number which

was ν0 suﬀers a decrement in proportion to the free area per molecule residing on the FML,

SR/NFML, divided by the area per molecule in the bulk, 4π(¯r/2)2, namely

SR = 4πR2.

(4.4)

The fraction SR/NS

4π(¯r/2)2 represents a factor decreasing the coordination number. Accordingly, the

surface energy should be proportional to the number of broken bonds viz.

Eσ ∼ NFML∆ν ∼ R2/r2
1.

(4.5)

Also in view of the fact that we are dealing with the central forces and these act at the center of

molecules we expect the surface of tension is located at Rσ = R + r1 ≈ R + RWS. Thus one would

expect the surface energy to be proportional to the area of the surface of tension, SRσ = 4πR2
σ,

with the curvature dependent coeﬃcient of proportionality σ(Rσ):

Eσ ∼ R2

σσ(Rσ).

(4.6)

In the limit R → ∞ the surface tension energy Eσ should reproduce standard relationship for

the plane surface viz. Eσ = 4πR2σ

. So we reconstruct coeﬃcient of proportionality in Eq.(4.6).

Finally, comparing Eq.(4.5) and Eq.(4.6) we obtain

Eσ = 4πR2

(4.7)

Furthermore, regarding subsequent minimization of the total energy (balance condition), we

prefer to rewrite the surface energy of the bubble in an integral representation for convenience

and thus introduce the surface tension function ˜σ(r) through:

Eσ =

Z

2˜σ(r)

r,

which also happens to be the Laplace form. Of course if ˜σ is put equal to σ

and integration is

performed over the volume 4πR3/3, one obtains the result Eσ = 4πR2σ

. However, here we must

∞

∞

proceed with the space integration over the range from RWS to Rσ and obtain ˜σ(r) by solving the

integral equation:

Eq.(4.8) being diﬀerentiated with respect to R, gives us a Tolman-like expression:

(4.8)

(4.9)

This relationship sheds light on a physical meaning of the Tolman length ∆ in Eq.(1.1) through

the relation 2∆ ≈ RWS. Thus from the molecular point of view ∆ accounts for the molecules on

the curved ﬁrst molecular layer as having more neighbors (less broken bonds) that the molecules

on the plane interphase surface.

It is worth noting that the surface tension coeﬃcient of the

curved boundary depends not only on the position of the surface of tension, but also on the type

of representation of the surface energy.

V. ENERGY MINIMIZATION

Energy minimization condition can be naturally inscribed into our consideration in the fol-

lowing manner. As we have demonstrated above all parameters of the Ps trap can be obtained

from the o-Ps lifetime and the width of the narrow component of the ACAR spectrum. However

˜σ, entering Eq.(4.8), may be considered as an unknown function of R, neglecting the theoretical

prediction, Eq.(4.9). Thus we suggest to extract so-to-say ”experimental” dependence of ˜σ(R)

from the principal of the minimum of the total energy Etot of the Ps bubble5:

Etot = Eσ +

Here we added the term 4π

3 R3p0, which is the work against external pressure p0. This term is

important for rather large Ps bubbles in liquiﬁed gases.

To proceed with the minimization of Etot let us ﬁrst ﬁgure out a useful relationship for dE/dR:

dE
dR

=

2kU E
tan kU RU − kU RU

,

which can be obtained from Eq.(2.2) and Eq.(2.3) by diﬀerentiation over R and further exclusion
of κ. Then the balance condition dEtot/dR = 0 may be written as

VI. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

A. The bubble is a deep potential well for Ps

Using Eqs.(5.4-5.5) and knowing τo

Ps and ΘFWHM from the e+-e− annihilation experiments it

−

is possible to obtain microscopic values of ˜σ for the interphase boundary having curvature radius

about several angstroms.6 Deriving these relationships we did not use any particular expression

for the surface tension coeﬃcient vs curvature radius of the boundary. We assumed only that

cavity formation energy is written in the Laplace form, Eq.(4.8).

For all investigated molecular liquids ratios ˜σ/σ

are less than unity. Variations between the

∞

values corresponding to the ﬁnite well, Eq.(5.4), and the inﬁnite well, Eq.(5.5), is small (Tables 1,

2; Fig.5). The reason is that the obtained depth U of the potential well is rather large U ≫ E. In

Section 3 we mentioned that this inequality ensures self-consistent usage of the bell-like Ps wave

function in the frameworks of the present theory.

In [18] in some liquids (glycerin, ethylene glycol, methanol-water mixtures) was not fulﬁlled.

It implies large penetration of the Ps to the bulk of a liquid, which means that the results might

not be reliable.7

B. Proﬁles of the potential well and that of electronic density are diﬀerent

Previous formulations of the Ps bubble model, utilized ﬁnite well potential, were not able to

reproduce in a limiting case U → ∞ the Tao formula (3.9) for τo

Ps, obtained within the inﬁnite

−

potential well model.8 We avoid this drawback in the present formulation through the parameter

δ, which accounts some penetration of the outer electrons within the well. Thus δ discriminates

proﬁles of the potential and that of electronic density.

6Without the last term with p0 Eq.(5.5) was obtained in [7].

7We think that in [15,16,17,18] expression for the pick-oﬀ annihilation rate the square of the Ps psi-

function |ψ(r)|2 has to be multiplied on the respective value of the electronic density and than this

product should be integrated over space variables.

8In the frameworks of the conventional ﬁnite well model in the limit U → ∞ the Ps wave function

is conﬁned within the bubble only and does not overlap with outer electrons. Therefore the pick-oﬀ

annihilation rate equals to zero.

C. Separation of the position of the potential wall and the surface of tension

Another new and important element of the present formulation is the separation of the position

of the potential well (RU ), which reﬂects Ps into the bubble, and that of surface of tension

(R + RWS), related to interaction9 between the molecules residing on the ﬁrst molecular layer.

D. Correlation between the Tolman length and the Wigner-Seitz radius

Comparison between ”experimental” values of ˜σ/σ

and respective theoretical prediction,

∞

Eq.(5.9), for two values of the parameter 2∆ (RWS and 3RWS) are shown in Fig.5. One may

conclude that there is reasonable agreement between the theory and experimental data in spite

of many simpliﬁcations done, which could be inadequate especially in polar liquids or in liquids

with large non-spherical molecules.

Assuming validity of the Tolman equation and knowing ˜σ/σ

values, one may calculate the

∞

ratios 2∆/RWS. They are within the interval from 1 to 3, which is in a reasonable agreement with
Eq.(4.9).10 Our values of 2∆ for water are 5.4 and 3.3 ˚A (see Tables 1 and 2), which correlates

well with available literature data11: 6.0 [22], 1.8 [24] and 2.0 [1] ˚A. The same takes place in liquid

argon: we obtained 2∆ = 4.5-3.8 ˚A, while in [2] 2∆ = 7.3 ˚A.

In spite of the large uncertainty of the ∆/RWS values it is worse noting their correlation within

the classes of diﬀerent chemical compounds. In isooctane, neopentane and tetramethylsilane, i.e.

in liquids with round molecules values of 2∆/RWS are close to unity12 in agreement with Eq.(4.9).

In liquid hydrocarbons made up from normal, cyclic and aromatic molecules, in higher alcohols,

diethylether, acetone the ratio 2∆/RWS increases up to 1.8 in average. Probably it is related to the

orientation of molecules when their maximal linear dimension primarily directed perpendicularly

to the surface of the Ps bubble. Higher values of 2∆/RWS (up to 2.7) occur in low alcohols, water

and acetonitrile. These liquids consist of small polar molecules strongly interacting with each

other. It is interesting that 2∆/RWS in CS2 is also high in spite of CS2 molecule has no dipole

moment. However, as follows from radio-spectroscopy studies [23], complicate polar molecular

9rupture of intermolecular bonds.

10Experimental uncertainty of 2∆/RWS is about 100%.

11Data for droplets.

12Small value of 2∆/RWS in 1,4-dioxane, which does not belong to this class of compounds, probably

related to the special alignment of dioxane molecules on the surface of the bubble.

associates are presented in liquid CS2. As a result, an eﬀective dipole moment per molecule turns

out to be approximately 0.1 D and intermolecular binding energy between CS2 gets about 0.05 eV.

Thus one may expect that there is a correlation between 2∆/RWS and eﬃciency of intermolecular
interaction. The latter can be characterized, for example, by critical pressure pcr = a

27b2 , where
a and b are known parameters of the Van-der-Waals equation (Fig.6). This correlation is clearly

seen in a homological series of alcohols. It is diﬃcult to expect better correlation between the data

obtained from rather schematic Ps bubble model and parameters of the Van-der-Waals equation,

applied to the liquid phase.

E. Ps is an electrically neutral probe of the interphase boundary

A perturbation of the surface caused by the presence of the Ps atom in the bubble on does

not extend deep inside the liquid because of electrical neutrality of the positronium. One may

expect that the structure of the interphase boundary in the Ps bubble will be more close to the

free surface than in the case of the bubbles formed by excess electrons. It is also worse mentioning

that the surface of the Ps bubble is rather ”fresh”. Its age is no more than some nanoseconds.

Contrary, surfaces studied by means of conventional methods have the ages many orders higher.

So in liquids with rather long relaxation times properties of the boundary of the Ps bubble and

that of the equilibrium surface may be diﬀerent.

VII. CONCLUSION

Major part of this work is the development of the Ps bubble model, which forms the basis of the

method for determination if the local surface tension. The modiﬁcations done are the following.

Firstly, it is taken into account, that position RU of the potential well does not coincide with the

position of the surface of tension. Secondly, we admit a possibility of the electrons of the nearest

molecules to penetrate inside the Ps bubble. Just this feature allows us a to reproduce the Tao

formula as a limiting case U → ∞ of our ﬁnite potential well model. It is important that we did

not introduce undeﬁned parameters to the model. It is due to the additional constrain, Eq.(3.10),

which has the following physical meaning: in molecular liquids ”preexisting” free volume can not

localize Ps atom; in an ”unperturbed” liquid Ps exists in the quasi-free (swollen) state which

manifests experimentally like free e+ annihilation.

Elementary ”geometric” consideration of the cavity formation, done on a molecular level,

made possible to reproduce the Tolman equation and clear up the physical sense of the curvature

dependence of surface tension. We have found that Tolman’s length ∆ takes into account an

increase of the number of the nearest neighbors of a molecule, residing on the ﬁrst molecular

layer of the curved boundary of the bubble in comparison with coordination number of a molecule

on ﬂat interphase boundary. It is shown that particular value of the surface tension coeﬃcient

depends on the position of the surface of tension, and on the choice of explicit expression for the

energy of the bubble formation.

It is shown that the data on o-Ps lifetimes and widths of narrow component of ACAR spectra

allow to obtain ”experimental” values of the surface tension coeﬃcient without any hypotheses

about its concrete functional dependence vs R. The results are in a satisfactory agreement with the

Tolman relationship Eq.(4.9) and other independent evaluations of the surface tension coeﬃcients.

We have found a correlation between the ratio 2∆/RWS and critical pressure. It indicates on its

usefulness in consideration of intermolecular interactions and structure of surface layers.

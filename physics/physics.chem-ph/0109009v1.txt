Abstract

The increase in moment of inertia of SF6 in helium nanodroplets is calculated using the quantum

hydrodynamic approach. This required an extension of the numerical solution to the hydrodynamic

equation to three explicit dimensions. Based upon an expansion of the density in terms of the

lowest four Octahedral spherical harmonics, the predicted increase in moment of inertia is 170u˚A2,

compared to an experimentally determined value of 310(10) u˚A2, i.e., 55% of the observed value.

The diﬀerence is likely in at least part due to lack of convergence with respect to the angular

expansion, but at present we do not have access to the full densities from which a higher order

expansion can be determined. The present results contradict those of Kwon et al., J. Chem. Phys.

113, 6469 (2000), who predicted that the hydrodynamic theory predicted less than 10% of the

observed increase in moment of inertia.

There is considerable current interest in the spectroscopy of atoms and molecules solvated

in liquid Helium, particularly in 4He nanodroplets [1]. These provide microscopic probes

of the nature of this unique substance, the only physical system whose equilibrium state

remains a liquid as T

0 K. Further, helium has properties that make it an almost ideal

→

‘matrix’ for the production and characterization of novel chemical species [2]. One such

property is that even highly anisotropic solutes give rotationally resolved spectra, though

with eﬀective rotational moments of inertia several times that of the isolated molecule in the

gas phase [3, 4]. Development of a quantitative predictive theory for the enhanced eﬀective

moments of inertia will be valuable for future use of the spectroscopically observed rotational

constants to help determine the chemical carrier of an unassigned spectral feature, as they

are often used in gas phase spectroscopy.

It has been widely recognized that enhanced moments of inertia arise from the kinetic

energy of helium motion that is correlated with the rotation of the solute. In the case of SF6-

HeN [5], a ﬁxed frame, ﬁxed node diﬀusion Monte Carlo calculations on small clusters with

N = 8

20 He atoms have recovered rotational excitation spectra in excellent agreement

−

with that observed for SF6 in He nanodroplet with much larger number of helium atoms.

Such calculations do not directly give any dynamical information, however, and thus leave

open the question of how to physically characterize the helium motion. Two quantitatively

predictive dynamical models have been put forth that invoke very distinct types of helium

motion [6, 8]. In one [6, 7], a proposed ‘nonsuperﬂuid ﬂuid’ density of helium was calculated

using Path Integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) methods, and this density is assumed to rotate

rigidly with the molecule provided that the molecule-He potential is suﬃciently anisotropic

relative to the induced rotational energy. To date, this two ﬂuid model has been applied only

to SF6 and OCS [6, 7]. For SF6, the ‘two ﬂuid model’ gave a result in excellent agreement

with experiment [3]. The predicted increase in the eﬀective moment of inertia, ∆I, was
calculated as 327u˚A2 compared to a valued of 310(10) u˚A2 calculated from the observed

rotational constants. The level of agreement, fact, is far better than should be expected

given the considerably uncertainty in the relevant He-SF6 interaction potential [9]. The two

parameters that determine the anisotropy of the He-SF6 potential well have reported values

of

0.6

0.3 and 0.14

0.14 in Ref. [9].

The second approach, published by ourselves and coworkers [8], is based upon a hydro-

±

dynamic treatment for the helium ﬂow, which is assumed to maintain a constant solvation

2

density in the frame rotating with the molecule and be ideal (aviscous and irrotational). The

hydrodynamic approach was applied to a number of linear molecules, and was found to be in

good agreement for heavier molecules, including OCS. A key assumption of this work is that

of adiabatic following by which we mean that the helium density in the molecular frame of

a rotating molecule is the same as for a rigid molecule, ﬁxed in the laboratory frame. It has

recently been established experimentally [10] that for lighter molecules, in particular HCN

and DCN, that adiabatic following breaks down and explains at least the sign of the error

of the hydrodynamic theory in these cases.

In order to apply the hydrodynamic model, one needs the three dimensional helium den-

sity around the solute, which is known to be highly structured. The earlier hydrodynamics

work used helium density functional theory (DF) [11] to estimate this quantity. For sys-

tems with cylindrical or higher symmetry, DF is many orders of magnitude computationally

less expensive than Quantum Monte Carlo Methods but introduces additional uncertain-

ties beyond the ever present uncertainty in the Helium-Solute interaction potential. In this

work, the helium density around a static SF6 molecule, previously published by Barnett and

Whaley [12], is used to calculate the hydrodynamic contribution to the moment of inertia of

this molecule. Because of the diﬀerent symmetry (Oh versus C∞v) of this solute compared

to those treated previously, some changes had to be made in the computational procedure.

Most signiﬁcant, one degree of freedom could not be removed by separation of variables

(as it could be for a cylindrically symmetric density) and, as a result, the hydrodynamic

equation for the velocity potential had to be solved numerically in three degrees of freedom.

The computational procedures used in the present case are described in the next section and

the results presented in the last section.

I. HYDRODYNAMIC CALCULATIONS

The hydrodynamic calculations require an estimate of the three dimensional helium den-

sity around the solute molecule, SF6 in this case. This density will be totally symmetric in

the point group of the molecule, Oh in this case. This density, ρ(r, Ω), can be expanded in

terms of the spherical tensor operators:

ρ(r, Ω) = ρ0(r) + a4(r) T4(Ω) + a6(r) T6(Ω) + a8(r) T8(Ω) + . . .

Fox and Ozier [13] have presented a general procedure for to calculate these and higher

harmonics.

Barnett and Whaley have calculated the helium density around SF6 using the diﬀusion

Monte Carlo method. Their paper contains ﬁgures which give the radial isotropic density,

ρ0(r), and radial ‘cuts’ of the density along the C2, C3, and C4 symmetry axes. If we assume

that the density contains only the terms explicitly given in Eq. 1, then we can use the

isotropic density and the density cuts to determine the radial coeﬃcients a4(r), a6(r), and

a8(r) by using the equations:

In these equations, ρi represents the radial density along the Ci symmetry axis. The radial

density functions where determined by digitization of the images from the paper by Barnett

and Whaley for clusters of 69 Helium atoms, the largest for which they reported the density

cuts. These equations were derived by evaluation of the tensor operators (Ti) along each of

the symmetry axes and then inverting the linear system that relates the calculated density

along each cut. Figure 1 shows the radial tensor densities calculated from these density cuts.

It is apparent from this ﬁgure that the density in the ﬁrst solvation shell (which is the most

important for determination of the moment of inertia) is likely not fully converged with the

present truncation of the density expansion. Unfortunately, we were not able to obtain the

primary data from reference [12] which would have allowed the expansion to be carried to

higher order.

motion of the helium, we will assume that the molecule is undergoing classical rotation

where the second equality comes from the assumption that the helium density remains

constant in the frame rotating with angular velocity ω around the z axis. The boundary

conditions on φ are that the normal component of the ﬂuid velocity match the normal

component of velocity of any surface. The solution to Eq. 8 is linear in the angular velocity

and thus is solved numerically for unit velocity. Equating the helium kinetic energy with

the rotational kinetic energy, we can deﬁne ∆Ih by:

The ﬁrst equation holds for any velocity potential. The second has been derived from the

ﬁrst using vector identities and Eq. 8. As such, these two estimates need only be equal for

φ that is a solution to Eq. 8. It can also be shown that the net orbital angular momentum

produced by the helium ﬂow is, for the solution of Eq. 8, JHe = ∆Ih ω.

A numerical solution for φ was found on a grid of points in a spherical coordinate system.

The three cartesian axes of this coordinate system is aligned with three of the S-F bonds.
The range of r was selected between 3.5 and 10 ˚A with between 51 and 201 radial points.

The normal component of φ was selected to be zero on both the inner and outer constant

r surfaces. φ must be invariant to reﬂection in the x, y plane, and thus we numerically

restricted the solution to the θ = [0, π/2] and restrict the solution to have zero normal

derivative on the x, y plane. Reﬂection in each of the four planes perpendicular to the z axis

is equivalent to change in the direction of rotation, and thus leads to a change in the sign of

φ. As a result, the numerical solution for φ could be restricted to the domain ϕ = [0, π/4]

and φ selected to be zero on each of the planes ϕ = 0 and π/4. Between 41 and 161 equally

spaced angular points were used in each of the angular coordinates coordinates. Since φ or

5

its normal derivative is equal to zero on all the boundary surfaces, the surface integral in

Eq. 10 is zero.

The inhomogeneous partial diﬀerential Eq. 8 was converted to a ﬁnite diﬀerence equation

in the grid of points and solved by Gauss-Seidel iteration with successive overrelaxation [14].

These equations (which involve ln ρ and its gradient) become singular when ρ = 0. As a

result, the density is bounded to remain above a threshold value, which was selected as
ρmin = 10−5 ˚A−3 in this work. Solutions were iterated until the mean squared change in φ on
the grid points was less than a ﬁxed fraction (10−10 in this work) of the mean squared value

of φ on the grid points. For the largest grid used, this required about 6000 iteration cycles

with an overrelaxation parameter of 1.4 (ω in the notation used in Numerical Recipes [14]).
The two integral estimates for ∆Ih are found to be 171 and 168 u˚A2 respectively. This can be
compared with a value of ∆I = 310(10) u˚A2 inferred from the observed eﬀective rotational

constant of SF6 in 4He nanodroplets [3].

Kwon and Whaley [6] reported the ‘superﬂuid’ densities along the same symmetry axes,

as calculated using PIMC and their proposed superﬂuid estimator. These have greatly de-

creased anisotropy compared to the total density. Repeating the hydrodynamic calculation
using these densities gave ∆Ih = 12 u˚A2. This can be compared to their ‘superﬂuid’ con-
tribution of the moment of inertia increase of 22 u˚A2 [7]. These authors also claim to have

calculated the hydrodynamic contribution to the rotational constant used the total density
around SF6 and report ∆Ih = 31 u˚A2. This value is 5.5 times smaller than the value we have

calculated. Based upon our extensive experience with similar hydrodynamic calculations,

the modest 50% in hydrodynamic moment of inertia is inconsistent with the considerably

greater angular anisotropy of the total density compared to their reported ‘superﬂuid’ den-

sity.

II. DISCUSSION

The hydrodynamic prediction for the enhanced moment of inertia of SF6 in helium is

55% of the experimentally observed value. This can be contrasted with the results reported

∼
in [8], where for heavier rotors, the theory appeared to systematically overestimate the

size of the increased moment of inertia. Similarly, an overestimate of the hydrodynamic

estimate for the increased moment of inertia was found for a model problem of a planer

6

rotor interacting with a rigid ring of He atoms [15]. One explanation for the underestimate

in the present case is that the density model used has underestimated the true anisotropy of

the helium density, particularly in the ﬁrst solvation shell where the hydrodynamic kinetic

energy density is highest. This is supported by the results presented in ﬁg 1, where it is

demonstrated that the highest order anisotropy we have retained is still of considerable size

in this ﬁrst shell. Since the ϕ derivative of the density is the source term in the hydrodynamic

equation, addition of higher order anisotropies is expected lead to increased hydrodynamic

motion and thus an increased estimate of ∆Ih. This explanation for the limited success of

the hydrodynamic model in the present case can be tested by repeating the hydrodynamic

calculation using the full anisotropic helium density calculated by Quantum Monte Carlo

methods.

An alternative explanation, which cannot be ruled out at present, is that some fraction

of the helium motion is not ’irrotational’. The Kelvin minimum energy principle [16] states

that any ‘rotational’ solution to the equation of continuity will generate higher helium ki-

netic energy and thus He contribution to the moment of inertia. This would include the

hydrodynamics assumed by the ‘two ﬂuid’ model of Kwon and Whaley [6].

The ﬁxed node, Diﬀusion Monte Carlo calculations of Lee et al.[5] were in excellent

agreement with the experimental rotational excitation energies. This suggest that, barring

cancelation of errors, that the nodal structure of the wavefunction assumed in that work

(which had the nodal properties of the rigid rotor wavefunction for the SF6) should be a

reasonable description of the true many body wavefunction for this system.

It is useful,

therefore, to examine how consistent the hydrodynamic model is with the functional form

assumed in that work.

In a future publication, we will present a quantum derivation of the hydrodynamic ap-

proach. In that work, it will be shown that Eq. 8 arises from a variational optimization of

a one particle phase function that multiples the ground state wavefunction that describes

the helium in the frame that rotates with the molecule. The wavefunction for the orien-

tation of this axis system in space will be the rigid rotor function for the molecule. Thus,

the presence of the one particle phase functions will modify the nodal surfaces from that

assumed in the Lee et al. calculation. The size of the one particle phase argument will be
5˚A2ω, and for the J = 1 level we

mHeφ/¯h. The maximum value for φ for our solution is

∼

can approximate ω = 4πBeﬀ, where Beﬀ is the eﬀective moment of inertia of SF6 in helium,

7

1.04 GHz. This gives a maximum hydrodynamic phase of

0.04, and thus it appears that

≈

this will lead of small changes in the nodal properties. We would like to point out that for

the model problem of the planer rotor coupled to a ring of Helium (which can of course be

solved exactly), the errors in the equivalent ﬁxed node approximation was of this same size

and yet the DMC estimate of the rotational excitation energy had errors of at most a few

percent.

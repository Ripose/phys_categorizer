Abstract

A description of photoassociation by CW laser is formulated in the framework of grid meth-

ods. The Hamiltonian describing one or several bound states coupled to a multiple of continuum

manifolds via a radiative ﬁeld is written in the energy representation and diagonalized. The gen-

erality of the treatment allows to compute accurately and eﬃciently physical properties such as

non-linear high-intensity energy shifts, line shapes, and photoassociation rates both for isolated

and non-isolated resonances. Application is given to sodium photoassociation in the experimental

conditions of Mc Kenzie et al [Phys. Rev. Lett. 88, 090403 (2002)].

Inverted region for the

dependency of the rate vs. the intensity and non-symmetric lineshapes were predicted to occur

above the saturation limit. Comparison with the model of Bohn and Julienne [Phys. Rev. A 60,

414 (1999)] is discussed.

INTRODUCTION

Many experimental groups are presently working on the formation of ultracold molecules

and molecular quantum gases. A very eﬃcient scheme is the photoassociation reaction,

where two colliding atoms absorb a photon to make a molecule [1]; moreover ultracold

photoassociation spectroscopy [2] is capable of providing deep insight into the properties

of long range molecules, cold atomic collisions, or pair correlations in a condensate. The-

oretical two-body scattering models have been developed to compute the photoassociation

rates [3, 4, 5, 6, 7], in the framework of a perturbative treatment, adapted to situations

where low-intensity CW lasers are employed and many-body eﬀects are negligible. A linear

variation of the photoassociation rate as a function of intensity is then predicted. In the

work of Bohn and Julienne [6], which develops a semi-analytic theory yielding laser-induced

energy shifts and l ine broadening, the departure from this linear behavior is described, the

saturation limit at larger laser intensities being evaluated. In a condensate, the two-body

model should fail and Javanainen and Mackie [8] have developed a many-body theory

which predicts a saturation limit occurring at lower intensities and attributed to rogue

photodissociation. The search for saturation eﬀects has stimulated several experiments.

Measurement, by Mc Kenzie et al

[9], of the photoassociation rate in a sodium condensate

as a function of laser intensity has shown a linear behavior in the intensity range considered,

in agreement with the two-body Bohn and Julienne estimation, and in contrast with the

prediction of Javanainen and Mackie. For a quantum degenerate lithium atomic gas,

measurement [10] of the intensity dependence of the photoassociation rate has veriﬁed both

the large value of this rate (at a temperature T =600 nK) and the two-body saturation

eﬀect at intensities I ≥ 30 W/cm2. The agreement with theory is considered as reasonable

within the present experimental accuracy: the higher value of the measured saturation

limit, and the oscillations in the experimental rate in the 30-80 W/cm2 intensity range

should be conﬁrmed by measurements with a smaller error bar. For a non-degenerate gas of

cesium atoms, at a temperature of 40 µK, within an optical dipole trap, saturation limit is

reached for intensities above 100 W/cm2[11], and the experimental values then lay around

the theoretical curve : it is not clear whether such oscillations are due to uncertainties or

should be attributed to a physical eﬀect.

2

Recently Naidon and Masnou-Seeuws [12] have developed a time-dependent many-body

theory of photoassociation in an atomic Bose-Einstein condensate, showing that several

physical eﬀects depend on pair correlations. They show that the two existing models for the

description of such correlations [13, 14], diﬀer in their predictions of the photoassociation

line shapes at large intensities. Precise measurements of the variation of the line shapes as

a function of cw laser intensity should therefore give insight into the optimal description of

many-body eﬀects.

The aim of the present paper is to anticipate such measurements by revisiting the

theoretical treatment of photoassociation line shapes, taking advantage of the eﬃciency

of grid methods [15, 16, 17, 18] for the numerical description of cold collisions and long

range molecules, particularly in cases where several channels are involved. Actually,

the later methods have been widely used for the computation of photoassociation rates

[19, 20, 21, 22], since they can determine very precise energies and wave functions,

both for bound and for continuum levels.

It has been demonstrated that due to their

global character, mapped grid methods are ideally suited to precise computation of the

perturbations occurring in molecular spectra, such as Rb2[23, 24, 25] or K2[26] singlet-

triplet mixing.

In such cases, the perturbation of one level of a given series should be

attributed to a large number of bound or continuum levels of the other series, and local

perturbation treatments are poorly adapted. However, up to know, attempts to compute

the photoassociation line shapes via grid methods have not been very eﬃcient [27, 28]

and the interpretation of precise measurements is routinely performed with Numerov

type approaches [29]. The present paper is proposing an alternative way of implement-

ing grid methods for the calculation of photoassociation line shapes, energy shifts, and rates.

The paper is organized as follows: The description of the present model is reported

in Section II-IV. The link with previous models, such as the Bohn and Julienne model is

discussed in Section V, where the various assumptions and approximations are underlined.

Application to the cases of Sodium photoassociation in the experimental conditions of Ref.

[9] is presented in Section VI. Section VII will summaries and discuss the outlook of the

method.

II. THE PRESENT MODEL - PRELIMINARY REMARKS

The physical process of photoassociation (PA) can be divided into three steps. Initially

(step I), a thermal ensemble of cold atoms is in the ground electronic state; the probability

to ﬁnd a colliding pair with relative motion at energy E and angular momentum l is given

by:

pB(E) =

(2l + 1) exp(−E/(kBT ))
Zeq

,

where T is the temperature, and kB is the Boltzmann constant. The partition func-

tion Zeq was shown in [30] to be well approximated by the classical expression
Zeq = QT V = V (2πµkBT )3/2/h3 for a gas of non-interacting pairs in a volume V .

Further discussion regarding Zeq could be found in [30].

The radial wave function which corresponds to the pair is represented with a continuum

eigenfunction

Here, µ is the reduced mass of the pair, and V (R) is the Born-Oppenheimer potential curve

for the relevant, here the ground, electronic state.

At the second step (step II), the intensity of a CW laser with frequency ω is ramped

within a time scale that can be varied from hundreds of ns to several µs. Along this

preparation period, the continuum states are coupled to one or more bound vibrational

levels v, J that belong to one or more excited electronic states e. Each of the levels in the

excited state, denoted by

γ0e

time, and so are the states of the total system.

Finally, during the stable period of the experiment (step III), the laser reaches its peak

constant intensity I. For the trap-loss or multiphoton detection scheme which will be de-

scribed here, the duration of this period is on the order of ms.

III. NUMERICAL DESCRIPTION OF THE FIELD-MOLECULE SYSTEM

The initial state is a thermal ensemble composed of atom pairs, with several angular

momenta l. Each pair is coupled to several J partial waves components on the excited

state. For simplicity, the equations will be written hereby for one value l andJ of the

angular momentum. To obtain P(E)→j one has to compute the initial and ﬁnal eigenstates

of the Hamiltonian without and with the light interaction. In the global grid method used

here, this is achieved by representation of the Hamiltonian in a certain basis, and then a

diagonalization. The diagonalization step is the most expensive computationally, and it

scales as N 3 where N is the number of basis function. A selection of an appropriate basis

prior to the diagonalization is hence crucial for the eﬃciency of the method.

A. The initial states: R-representation of the unperturbed molecule in a box

Using numerical grid methods, a numerically complete set of of eigenvalues and eigen-

vectors of the time-independent Schr¨odinger Hamiltonian ˆHR

sc is obtained for the isolated

molecule, for the ground and excited potentials. This is achieved by using the mapped

Fourier grid method (see for example the references [15, 16, 17, 31]). Within the procedure,
a unitary transformation ˆUmapp is performed on the Hamiltonian eq. (2), which is written
ˆUmapp, is represented on
in equally space grid R. The resulted Hamiltonian ˆHx

sc = ˆU†

ˆHR

the phase-space occupancy of the problem. The potential energy operator is written simply
as ˆV(x), and the kinetic energy operator reads:

Lx is the length of the grid, ˆD is the ﬁrst derivative operator matrix, given by (assuming

and ˆJ (x) = dx

dR is the (diagonal) Jacobian operator for the transformation.



A suﬃcient representation for ˆHR

sc by an equally spaced grid demands typically N ∝ 104
basis functions for the example considered below in section VI. As was shown in [17], the

use of a mapped grid leads to a reduction of about an order of magnitude in the basis size,

to several thousands.

A diagonalization of ˆHx

sc gives the initial,

interaction-free, wave functions and their

energies for both electronic states |ψg

. The eigenvalues with E < 0,

quasi-continuum states. The continuum under this picture is therefore tied to the box size

from which is was deduced.

In order to take account of the spontaneous emission in the excited channel e, an imagi-

B. The ﬁnal states

1. The ﬁeld-dressed molecule

A CW laser with constant intensity I, detuned by ∆a relative to the atomic resonance

line, introduces a radiative coupling between the ground state and the excited state. After

making the rotating wave approximation, the full dressed Hamiltonian under the interaction

can be written as:

(7)

(8)

ˆHR = 



ˆΩ(R)

ˆHg
sc
ˆΩ(R) ˆHe

sc + ∆a





The coupling between the ground and the excited state is introduced by the Rabi coupling
operator through the transition dipole moment: ˆΩ(R) = −Aˆµeg(R)
I
2cε0 , where ˆµeg is
the spatially dependent transition dipole moment between the two electronic states, and

q

A is an angular factor depending upon the polarization of the laser and the orientation

of the molecular axis. In the R representation Ω(R) is a local, i.e. diagonal, operator. A
diagonalization of ˆHR gives the ﬁnal states |Ψj(E)i.

2. Energy eigenstates representation

For the ﬁnal states, one has to diagonalize the Hamiltonian describing the interaction of

the molecule with the radiation ﬁeld routinely for many experimental parameters. A direct
diagonalization of ˆHR even for the mapped grid representation, is ineﬃcient, mainly due to

mainly due to the redundancy in the representation of the basis for both potentials. An

improved representation for the coupled system is hence crucial. This can be obtained by

7

writing ˆHR in the energy eigenstates of the single channels Hamiltonians ˆHsc. The unitary
transformation ˆUE−rep is performed on ˆHR to give

ˆHE−rep = ˆU†

E−rep

ˆHR

ˆUE−rep,

the Hamiltonian in the energy representation. The eigenvectors that were obtained as the

solutions for the single channel problem serve as the transformation matrices between the

two representations, so that:

ˆUE−rep = 

ˆUg

where ˆUg/e
ground and excited states, |ψg

E−rep are the matrices which contain the complete set of eigenvectors for the

E(R)i and

φe
v,J (R)
(cid:12)
(cid:12)

, respectively.
(cid:11)

The coupled channel Hamiltonian in the energy states picture becomes:

• for the diagonal part in the excited channel subspace

hφe

v (R)| ˆH |φe

v (R)i = E0e

v + ∆a − iγ0e

v , E0e

v < 0,

(11)

where ∆a is the detuning from the atomic resonance, and γ0e
v

the natural width for

the vibrational level e, v.

• for the diagonal matrix elements in the ground channel subspace:

hψg

n (R)| ˆH |ψg

n (R)i = E0g
n .

(12)

For clarity, explicit l dependency is ommited. We remark here again that E0g

n include

both the bound and the quasi-continuum parts of the spectrum. E0g

n > 0 is therefore

discrete, for a given box normalization.

• for the non-diagonal part of ˆHE−rep:

~Ωe,v

g,n = hφe

v (R)| ˆH|ψg

n (R)i

(13)

8

We can employ the R-centroid approximation for ˆµeg(R) and write:

~Ωe,v

g,n = ¯Ω hφe,v | ψg

ni ≡ ¯Ω ˜F e,v

g,n

(14)

where now ˜F e,v

g,n denotes the Frank-Condon factor between vibrational levels from the

two diﬀerent electronic states.

The advantage of the energy representation is the possibility to pick the energy levels

that participate in the process and thus reduce the required basis set. We shall consider

formally the case of an isolated resonance where the ground state continuum |ψg

n (R)i

is coupled only to single bound level in the excited state |φe

v (R)i. The detuning from

the atomic resonance ∆a could be replaced by ∆, the detuning from the excited bound

level. A generalization to several bound excited states, or even a whole continuum, is

straightforward. From this point on, we reduce all the indices for the excited state.

By moving to the energy representation we reduce the representation for the coupled

channels problem by about one half, to the order of N ≈ 1000 in the example discussed

below in section VI.

3. Getting out of the box - from E to E′ representation.

Note that so far, the representation of the continuum is done using a box unity-

normalized wave functions. This box-dependent basis for the continuum is arbitrary, and

therefore it could be reduced.

In order to do so, one had to deﬁned a box-independent Frank-Condon factor. Box-

independent quantities for the continuum are obtained by moving from the box-normalized

to the energy-normalized wave functions. The relation between the two is given by:

−1/2

∂E
∂n (cid:19)

(cid:18)

|ψg

n (R)i

n (R)

=

E

˜ψg
(cid:12)
(cid:12)
(cid:12)

where the inverse of the level density, ∂E

∂n , is given simply, for a large enough box, by
the energy diﬀerence between two adjacent quasi-continuum levels, given under the box-

normalization constraint. An energy normalized Frank-Condon proﬁle:

(15)

(16)

F e(E) =

∂E
∂n

r

˜F e,n
g

9

could now be obtained. F e(E) is a box-independent, numerically continuous function of

the scattering energy. In fact, F e(E) is a physical measure for the energy dependence of

the interaction and it thus the function that one would like to sample for obtaining the

minimal energy representation. The alternative basis has to capture the functional energy

dependence of the Frank-Condon proﬁle, using the smallest basis. This could be done in

principle with any sampling procedure [33]. The technical details regarding the numerical

procedure we employed in this work is described at the appendix.

Assuming such a minimal representation basis was found, we will denote it by |g, n′i

for the ground state continuum, for n′ > nB, nB being the number of bound states. The

expression for the quasi-continuum diagonal part of the full Hamiltonian (eq.12) reads now:

and all the other diagonal parts remained unchanged. The nondiagonal part in the alterna-

tive basis is deﬁned through the energy normalized Frank-Condon proﬁle as:

hg, n′| ˆH |g, n′i = E0g

n′ , n′ > nB

~Ωe

g,n′ = ¯Ω ˜F e,n′

g = ¯Ω

−1

∂E
∂n′

r

F e(E).

(17)

(18)

A diagonalization of the Hamiltonian (eqs.[17,18]) gives the set of eigenstates for the

coupled Hamiltonian, |Ψj(E)i, which include components on both channels, with possible

contributions from all the bound or free levels. The energy eigenvalues which are obtained

are again complex and γj = Im(Ej) is the width of the level |Ψj(E)i. The transition
probability from any initially populated state |g, n′i to any ﬁnal state |Ψj(E)i, is simply:

P(g,n′)→j = |hΨj(E) | g, n′i|2

(19)

It is important to notice here that because |Ψji is an eigenstate of the coupled Hamiltonian,

a pair that reaches this state at the beginning of the ﬁnal step of the experiment remains

in the same state without any signiﬁcant dynamics beside an exponential decay with the

lifetime γj.

Table 1 summarizes our procedure so far with the diﬀerent representations and their

typical necessary basis sizes. We started from the Hamiltonian on the equally spaced

grid representation. A minimal representation of the problem with such a grid demands

a basis of about NR = 104 function. We then used the phase space occupation of the

problem to move to a mapped grid, and reduce the basis set in about an order on

magnitude to Nx = 103, for each of the electronic states. The transformation to the
energy representation reduces the excited state manifold. The reduced E′ representation

minimizes the basis for the ground state, so that ﬁnally we could solve the whole coupled

channels problem with a basis at the order of NE′ ∼ 200, or even smaller. At this sizes of

basis the method become eﬃcient, even compared to the semianalytic perturbative methods.

In the next section the deduction of the various PA experimental parameters from P(g,n′)→j

(and γj) is presented.

LINESHAPES.

IV. EXTRACTION OF THE ENERGY SHIFTS, TRAP-LOSS RATES, AND

With the formal deﬁnitions of the previous subsection we can now move to deﬁne the

various physical quantities that are being measured on the system. The probability to ﬁnd

an atom pair at the beginning of the stable period with energy Ej (which we will denote as

zero time) is given by:

p(Ej, 0) = Npair(0)

P(g,n′)→jpB(En′) =

P(g,n′)→jpB(En′)

(20)

N 2

atom(0)

2 Xn′

Xn′

11

where Natom(0) and Npair(0) are the number of atoms and atom pairs at time 0, and pB is

deﬁned above (see eq. (1)). As was explained at the last paragraph the only dynamics at

the stable period are the exponential decay of the j-th level. At later times thus:

p(Ej, t) = exp(−γjt/~)p(Ej, 0)

(21)

so that the total probability density for the whole ensemble is:

Ptot(t) =

p(Ej, t) =

Xj

N 2

atom(0)

2 Xn′,j

exp(−γjt/~)P(g,n′)→jpB(En′)

(22)

The observed reaction rate v(t) at any given time is the change of Ptot(t) versus time:

v(t) = −

Xn′,j

γj exp(−γjt/~)P(g,n′)→jpB(En′) ≡

hγ(t)i

(23)

N 2

atom(0)
2~

The rate could be thus interpreted as the thermally averaged lifetime. On the other hand,

the experimental deﬁnition of the diatomic reaction rate for a sample containing Natoms is:

v(t) = −K

N 2

atoms(t)
V

.

(24)

Now, a comparison between the two expressions yields the relation between the calculated

and experimental rate constants, which holds for any given time. Speciﬁcally for t=0 one

gets:

V hγ(0)i
2Zeq
In a fashion similar to the experimental, a calculation of K as a function of the detuning

hγ(0)i
2QT

K(I, ∆) =

(25)

=

yields the lineshape. The peak value of K as a function of ∆, and the value of the detuning

at the peak are termed as the maximum reaction rate Kmax and the energy shift E1 for a

given intensity and temperature, respectively.

Before moving forward, we remark that the model is non perturbative with respect to the

laser intensity. It is also well oriented to dynamical, time dependent-type calculations. Fur-

thermore, a generalization of the method to multiple coupled continuum manifolds, several

bound states, or to include hyperﬁne structure, is strightforward. Its drawback is mainly

being a little less eﬃcient computationally, mainly due to the expansive diagonalization

step. Nevertheless, this could be overcomed, especially for calculating lineshapes and satu-

ration eﬀects, as we will show at the application of section VI. But, before doing so, we will

present brieﬂy in the next subsection the necessary expressions of the method of Bohn and

Julienne[6] (B & J) to which our expression (25) will be compared to.

12

V. ADJUSTMENT OF BOHN AND JULIENNE MODEL TO THE GRID METH-

ODS FRAMEWORK

In this subsection we present the method of B & J [6], and adjust it to take advantage

of the available grid methods. We will limit the treatment to the simple case of a single

isolated resonance embedded in a continuum. The scattering-theory-based method deﬁnes

a scattering amplitude SE for a pair of atoms in the center of mass framework. The square

of SE is referred to as the probability to initiate in a unbound state with kinetic energy E

and be lost at inﬁnite time, due to a light-induced coupling to a bound molecular state.

According to Fano[6, 34], |SE|2 is given by:

|SE|2 =

γΩE

(E − ∆ − E1) −

.

2

γ+ΩE
2

(cid:0)

(cid:1)

here ∆ is the detuning of the light frequency of the resonance bound state’s energy , and γ is

the natural linewidth of the bound level. E1 and ΩE are the energy shift and the stimulated

absorption/emission rate, respectively. With the help of second order perturbation theory

it was shown in [34] that:

E1 = P.

dE′ |ΩE′|2
∆ − E′

Z

where P. stands for ‘the principle part of’, and ΩE is the dipole moment coupling that was

deﬁned above (see eq.(13)).

The rate of loss from the system is given by performing a velocity thermal averaging of

|SE|2, for all the initial scattering energies, and with respect to all the relevant partial waves,

to obtain the observed rate loss:

and the wavenumber of the atom-pair.

p

It is important to comment here, that in order to calculate the energy dependent ΩE for

eqs. (26-28) the energy dependency of the continuum has to be calculated [see eq. (1)].

The common use of local solvers like the Numerov propagator [33] for that purpose made

Fano’s formalism impractical computationally. An energy independent ΩE was assumed for

13

demonstrative purposes in Ref. [34]. Obviously, as one can see from ﬁgure 3 this is far from

being adequate to describe molecular systems in any other circumstances.

Using the ideas of Du et al.

[35] Bohn and Juliene combined the couple of regular and

irregular solutions of eq.(2) to write the energy shift E1 as:

these conditions, the rate is assumed to be inﬂuenced by the on-resonance light interaction.

The continuum is represented now by only a single continuum state and the thermal

At the next section a comparison between the various expressions will be demonstrated

by a concrete application.

VI. APPLICATION

The example chosen for numerical application will be the on-resonance photoassociation

of the v=135 , J=1 level of Na2 A1Σ+

u , in the experimental conditions of the NIST experi-

ment [9]. The initial state is a pair of colliding atoms with l = 0 or 2 (see ﬁgure 1). The

calculations have been performed using the same potentials as in Ref.[12]. The position of

the repulsive wall in the ground state X1Σ+

g has been slightly modiﬁed, so that the binding
energy of the last levels is E(v = 65) = 0.013cm−1 for l=0 and E(v = 64)=0.25cm−1

for l=2. The experimental values for these levels are E(v = 65) = 0.013cm−1 and

E(v = 64) = 0.25cm−1, respectively.

In the excited curve, the level v=135 is bound by

49.23 cm−1, the two neighboring levels being v=134 at -52.95 cm−1 and v=136 at -45.76

cm−1. Note that in experiment the binding energy of the resonant level is 43 cm−1. The

natural width is set to γ = 2 π× 18.36 MHz to match the experiment.

Figure 2 presents the coupling proﬁle, i.e., the Frank Condon factors multiplied by the

Rabi frequency (see eq. 14), for various bound levels n of the ground state coupled to one

level (v=135) of the excited state at intensity of 1 W/cm2. In the main frame n varies from

0 to 64 and oscillations in the coupling term are visible as the Condon point is moving to

large internuclear distances . The FC factors are identical for both partial waves when

n ≤ 64 . The n = 65 level is bound only for the S wave.

At the upper and the lower panels of ﬁgure 3 the coupling proﬁle for the continuum

part of the spectrum is shown, for both S and D partial wave, respectively. The left and

the right panels show the same proﬁle in logarithmic and linear scale. The last bound level

n = 65 for the S wave, is shifted for the D wave and appears as a shape resonance with

a well deﬁned width in the D continuum. For the continuum part of the spectrum, the

Condon point is energy independent. The structure of the coupling proﬁle of the continuum

is a signature of the energy dependence of the continuum wave functions[30]. The rotational

barrier on the D potential surface makes the D proﬁle to vanish more strongly near the

In the next subsections the results of grid method will be presented in three steps: First,

the light induced energy shift will be calculated and discussed. Then, the results for the rest

of the PA observables will be presented in the low intensity regime, where the perturbative

method should be adequate. Finally, the results for in the high intensity regime, where the

appearance of saturation eﬀect are explored.

A. Light Induced Energy Shifts

Using Fano’s perturbative expression for the energy shift (eq.27) and the right panels

of ﬁgure 3 it is understood that the energy scale which is needed for the calculation of the

energy shift is larger in many order of magnitude then the thermal energy. (see the appendix

for a numerical example). On the other hand, as will be shown below, the lineshape is

inﬂuenced only by the coupling proﬁle in the vicinity of the thermally populated energy.

This separation of scales can help us furthermore in reducing the basis set, depending upon

which physical quantity one would like to calculate.

panels, now in a linear scale.

The light induced energy shift for intensities up to 100W/cm2, are presented in ﬁgure 4.

The energy shift was calculated using the S continuum part of the ground state manifold.

The green line is the energy shift that was calculated using the modiﬁed Bohn and Julienne

perturbative method and is temperature independent by deﬁnition. In red, blue and black,

we present the energy shift using our method for T = 20µK, 2µK and 200nK, respectively.

All the curves are linear as expected. A diﬀerence exists between the energy shifts, but it is

too small to be measurable. The diﬀerence in the slopes between the present calculations

and the perturbative method is also within the experimental accuracy. An important result

we observed in our calculation is that the perturbative linearity of the energy shift with

respect to the intensity was conserved for any feasible intensity that was checked (up to

100kW/cm2 and higher). Another feature of the perturbative limit is the additivity of the

contributions from diﬀerent partial waves with respect to the bound and the continuum.

Figure 5 presents the energy shift for the full interaction, i.e., bound and continuum part

of the spectrum for both S and D partial waves. No deviations from the perturbative

treatment were found with respect to the additivity.

B. Low Intensity regime: the perturbative limit

Saturation eﬀects for the case of photoassociation in a sodium condensate were not

observed up to 1.2kW/cm2. A typical lineshape for an intensity of 100W/cm2, well below

the saturation limit, is presented in Figure 6. The lines were all centered to zero detuning.

The red line presents the rate versus the detuning for our method for T=500 nK. In black

line the correspondent result for the Bohn and Julienne method with the same temperature

is shown. The two lines show the same width but diﬀer at the peak height by less then

10%, small comparable to the experimental accuacy. Moreover, as can be seen from the

blue line in the ﬁgure, a small change of the temperature for the perturbative method

(to 400nK)reproduces exactly the same lineshape as in our method. Figure 7 presents

with the same colors of ﬁgure 6 the results for the maximum rate lineshape Kmax as

a function of the intensity. All the curves are linear, as expected for the perturbative

regime. Again, the agreement between the two methods is within the experimental accuracy.

We have to remark here that, to our best knowledge, an extensive study of the

the values obtained from the perturbative method without energy averaging (see eq. 30). A

single state approximation for the rate seems to be inadequate, at least for the description

of most of the temperature dependence of th e trap loss.

In addition, we checked the

results obtained applying the perturbative model (28) with thermal energy averaging but

assuming a constant coupling Ω(E). The cyan and green lines show the values for Ω(E)

taken at kbT and 0.5kbT , respectively. The constant coupling approximation ﬁts perfectly

to the fully thermally averaged model for the low temperature regime with E = 0.5kbT .

Two factors play a role in this situation: the coupling proﬁle (see ﬁg. 3) and the Boltzmann

thermal distribution (see eq. 1). The ﬁrst increases with E while the last decreases. From

the results it seems that in our case, the compensation of the two factors takes place at

E=0.5KBT . Above this temperature, the thermal width starts to play a role, and the

saturation behavior, but the saturation limit is not the same. The results for the single

energy perturbative approximation are signiﬁcantly lower then the other two methods. The

intensities for reaching saturation are way too high to be observed experimentally, and,

indeed, were never observed. The validity of the two-body model does not hold for such

intensities, and therefore the signiﬁcance of the results is mainly in predicting a saturation

eﬀect for other species where the saturation is reached at lower intensities, e.g., cesium[11],

lithium[10] or strontium [38].

the peak rate constant decrease with the light intensity. This prediction has never been

observed, and it might be feasible experimentally for species other then Sodium. The

saturation for the case of cesium in a MOT may give clue to this inverted behavior[11]

the positive one, and the unsymmetrical form of the lineshape is more pronounced with

the increase of the intensity. Figure 12 presents the lineshapes close to and beyond the

saturation limit of the perturbative method, for T = 20µK. The lines are centered to zero

detuning. Beside the obvious power broadening, the lineshapes remain symmetrical even

for high intensities.

the oﬀ resonance laser is determined only by the distance from the threshold. Positive

and negative detuning are identical in that sense and the lineshape is therefore symmetric.

For higher temperatures, the population spread is larger and the inner structure of the

continuum start to play a role. This is the origin for the deviation from a Lorentzian

lineshapes which presented in ﬁgure 5 of [6], for temperatures of 1mK. This non symmetric

form is expected to be washed out at low temperatures and high intensities, where the

thermal wi dth is much smaller then the radiative width.

In the non-perturbative method, all paths are being taken into account. At large intensity,

multi-paths processes can take place. A ﬂux could bounce from the bound level back to the

continuum and vice verse. As can be seen in ﬁgure 3, the coupling proﬁle indicates for a

maximum of the interaction around 10−2cm−1. The shoulder of the lineshape appears at a

28

detuning equal to the maximum. Another support for this interpretation could be found in

the energy dependence of the transition probability, P(g,n′)→j. At low intensity single path

processes take place and the transition probability is signiﬁcant only close to the threshold.

At large intensities other parts of the proﬁle play a role, P(g,n′)→j deviates from a symmetric

Lorentzian and peaks also at the energy of the maximum of the interaction proﬁle. A further

increase of the intensity enhances even further the weight of the non-linear eﬀects on the

line shape, and so the lineshape at positive detuning is rolled by non linear eﬀects. A clue

to support this result could be seen maybe at the apparent unsymmetrical lineshapes that

were measured for the saturation limit of cesium in a MOT(see [11]).

VII. DISCUSSION AND SUMMARY

In the present paper we have explored the advantage of grid methods for performing a

non-perturbative calculation of photoassociation lineshapes, energy shifts and rates. Several

physical properties determine the energy scales that are involved in the PA experiment and

characterize the outcomes of the various observables. The energy shift, which is the value

of the detuning at which a photoassociation lineshape peaks, is the parameter which is the

less sensitive to the structure of the interaction proﬁle and the thermal population. In order

to calculate it accurately one has to consider an interaction energy which goes up to several

hundreds of Kelvins and to include all the manifolds which participate in the interaction

with the bound level. The interaction energy is independent of the thermal occupation of

these levels. A full non-perturbative treatment for the energy shift is therefore extremely

diﬃcult, but fortunately, it is also unnecessary. The advantage of the grid methods in

calculating energy shifts is minor and they could be obtained eﬃciently and accurately by

perturbative methods.

For low laser intensities, the natural linewidth of the bound level, which is usually at the

order of hundred of MHz, or tens of milliKelvin, is the next energy scale in the hierarchy.

The width of the lineshape and the scaling of the peak height are determined by this

parameter at low intensities. As the intensity of the laser increases, the radiative coupling,

or the Rabi frequency of the given scattering energy Ω(E) begin to dominates, and lead to

power broadening and saturation.

The thermal energy is commonly the smallest energy scale.

It ranges from about a

hundred of nanokelvins for the coldest condensates, to a few hundreds microkelvins, for

‘hot’ MOTs. For low temperatures, the narrow width of the populated energy band makes

the coupling proﬁle to be almost insigniﬁcant. Saturation could then be described quite well

with the perturbative methods. As the temperature increases, the inner structure of the

continuum is encrypted into deviations of the lineshape from a symmetric Lorentzian, and

an inverted region of Kmax as the intensity increases. Some of these deviations, especially

the ones which are visible at the low intensity limit, for relatively high temperatures,

could be well described by the single-path perturbative models. Other features which

result only at high intensities, could be calculated only with the help of the multi-path model.

The non perturbative model that we presented in this paper can serve as a useful tool to

model easily other cases where non trivial lineshapes appear. These include:

• Photoassociation close to threshold.

• Accidentally degenerate or almost degenerate levels that originate from diﬀerent elec-

tronic states. In both cases, interaction between several levels in the excited state need

to be put in the framework of a higher order model. The case of resonant coupling

photoassociation [19, 20, 23, 25] is a good example.

• Active interaction between multiple continuum manifolds, where more than a single

continuum is populated or depopulated during the process. One possibility is when

more then one partial wave participates in the scattering, e.g., the D resonance in

85Rb (see ref.

[37]). In cases of lower barriers, higher temperatures, or in the cases

of processes that take place by explicitly populating the continuum, highly structured

lineshapes might be resolved by our method.

Finally, the dynamical approach which is the basis for the present study is an important

building block for a future comprehensive time dependent description of the many body

interaction in the description of PA.

APPENDIX

Two purposes are the objects of this appendix: the numerical details of the sampling

of the continuum proﬁle F e(E) (see eq. (16)), and the demonstration of the energy scale

that is needed for the calculation of the energy shift. The sampling of the continuum proﬁle

F e(E) could be done in principle by a global or local numerical sampling procedure (see

for example [33]).The common procedures take advantage of an a-priori knowledge about

the given function to be sampled. In this work we limited ourselves to a naive approach

and determined the sampling of the proﬁle a-posteriori according to the results that were

obtained with a given basis. The criterion we employed was the numerical convergence of

the integral over a given moment of the interaction proﬁle F e(E):

I =

[F e(E)]ndE ≈

∆(Ej)[F e(Ej)]n

(A-1)

Ecut

Z

Xj

where n is the order of the moment, Ej is the discrete sampling energy points, and ∆(Ej)

is the energy diﬀerence between two adjacent points. The upper bound for the proﬁle Ecut

is discussed below. The procedure initiates with a small set of points, and a new point is

added or rejected between any two old points according to its inﬂuence on the value of I.

34

The quality of the procedure is determined by the tolerance parameter τ =

FIG. 13: Number of basis function vs. the tolerance parameter τ . The numbers near the lines

stand for diﬀerent moments of the interaction proﬁle F e(E). The box normalized from which the

original proﬁle is deduced contains 920 basis functions.

As can be understood, the convergence of the sampling becomes more eﬃcient for higher

moments, which emphasize more the features in the proﬁle. Too high moments, however,

smear completely the functional structure and so an optimum moment have to be found.

We have to comment here that in order to increase the resolution of the basis set with

respect to the thermally populated energy near the threshold (for E < NkBT , N is usually

10), we inserted a small energy grid (typically 50-100 basis functions) with constant energy

step at close-to-threshold energies.

35

In ﬁgure A2 the resulted energy shifts are plotted as a function of the tolerance parameter

for the various moment orders. The numerically exact value which was calculated using the

perturbative method is 27.8MHz. The values for moment order above the 5th, convergence

to this values within less then 5% for tolerance value of 5 × 10−5. The basis set that was

taken in this paper uses τ = 5 × 10−7 and n = 9. Larger moments than the chosen exhibit

slower convergence and demand much smaller values of τ to produce an adequate basis set.

the tolerance parameter τ . The intensity is 100W/cm2,

the temperature is 2µK. Only calculation with respect to the S continuum are presented. The

continuum is sampled up to energy of 300K. The numbers near the lines stand for diﬀerent

moments of the interaction proﬁle F e(E).

We must remark also, that the only physical parameter which demands such a care in

36

the sampling is the energy shift. The values for the lifetime are much less inﬂuenced by

the size of the basis, and converged even at τ as small as 1 × 10−3. To demonstrate the

importance of very large energy scale that are needed to calculate the energy shift correctly

we present in ﬁgure A3 the calculated energy shift as a function of Ecut the upper bound of

the energy grid. Convergence of the energy shift is achieved only when reaching hundreds of

Kelvins. Note, again, that only the energy shift exhibit a sensitivity for such high energies.

For low laser intensities the lifetime is found to converge Ecut at the order of the thermal

energy grid. Convergence near the saturation limit demands extension of the grid up to the

ﬁrst minimum of the coupling proﬁle, i.e.,10−2cm−1, or tens of milikelvins. A basis set for

such energies contained less then 150 function and is adequate for calculating most of the

lineshapes features, except for energy shifts.

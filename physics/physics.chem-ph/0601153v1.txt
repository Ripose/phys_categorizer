Abstract

To make certain quantitative interpretations of spectra from NMR experi-
ments carried out on heterogeneous samples, such as cells and tissues, we must
be able to estimate the magnetic and electric ﬁelds experienced by the resonant
nuclei of atoms in the sample. Here, we analyze the relationships between these
ﬁelds and the ﬁelds obtained by solving the Maxwell equations that describe the
bulk properties of the materials present. This analysis separates the contribu-
tion to these ﬁelds of the molecule in which the atom in question is bonded, the
“host” ﬁelds, from the contribution of all the other molecules in the system, the
“external” ﬁelds. We discuss the circumstances under which the latter can be
found by determining the macroscopic ﬁelds in the sample and then removing
the averaged contribution of the host molecule. We demonstrate that the re-
sults produced by the, so-called, “sphere of Lorentz” construction are of quite
general validity in both static and time-varying cases. This analytic construct,
however, is not “mystical” and its justiﬁcation rests not on any sphericity in the
system but on the local uniformity and isotropy, i.e., spherical symmetry, of the
medium when averaged over random microscopic conﬁgurations. This local aver-
aging is precisely that which deﬁnes the equations that describe the macroscopic
ﬁelds. Hence, the external microscopic ﬁelds, in a suitably averaged sense, can
be estimated from the macroscopic ﬁelds. We then discuss the calculation of the
external ﬁelds and that of the resonant nucleus in NMR experiments.

Introduction

Overview

NMR spectroscopy is notable for its contribution to the study of the chemical and
physical properties of heterogeneous samples including living cells and tissues. Varia-
tion in the magnetic characteristics of a sample often bring about readily observable
changes in resonance frequency and spectral line shapes, thus providing unique probes
of cellular function (e.g., Brindle et al. (1974), Endre et al. (1984), Kirk et al. (1989),
Matwiyoﬀ et al. (1990)). A knowledge of the physics of systems with multiple com-
partments of diﬀering magnetic susceptibility has already laid the foundation for new
sorts of NMR experiments. The insightful article by Chu et al. (1990) explains some
fundamental aspects of contrast enhancement in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
that are brought about by paramagnetic metal-ligand complexes; and, the comprehen-
sive review by Levitt (1996) gives an independent explanation of some key phenomena.
Both articles emphasize the nature and value of the magnetic ﬁeld “experienced” by a
nucleus in a magnetically polarizable medium. They use the theoretical construct of
the, so-called, “sphere of Lorentz” in their analysis. However, this theory provoked us
into some deeper questions that seemed to warrant exploration; and, with this insight
came the expectation of a better understanding of experimental data and new experi-
mental methods. The accompanying article (Kuchel et al. (2003)) article illustrates the
results from some simple practical NMR experiments in which samples were chosen in
which there were diﬀerences in magnetic susceptibility across the (micro) boundaries of
the heterogeneous samples. The experiments were conducted on solutions, an emulsion
in the presence of a solution of the same substance, and a suspensions of red blood
cells (RBCs) made relatively paramagnetic.

Fields in NMR

NMR spectroscopy is based on the interaction of the spin of a nucleus with the mag-
netic ﬁeld in its neighbourhood. Hence, in order to model NMR experiments, the
magnetic ﬁeld in the immediate vicinity of the nucleus in the ‘host’ atom has to be
calculated. The atom itself may be free or bound as part of a molecule, or in rapid
exchange. In what follows, we shall refer to the nucleus as residing in a molecule with
the understanding that ‘molecule’ should be interpreted as just the host atom when it
is not chemically bound. An NMR machine is designed to produce a strong uniform
magnetic ﬁeld into which a sample is introduced. As a result of its introduction, the
ﬁeld in and around the sample is perturbed by the interaction of the ﬁeld with the
magnetic moments of the molecules. Most molecules possess no intrinsic magnetic mo-
ment because the electrostatic binding forces tend to lead to a net cancellation of the
orbital and spin angular momenta of the electrons. In the presence of an applied ﬁeld,

2

the orbital moments precess and generate an extra component that is aligned opposite
to that ﬁeld (the diamagnetic eﬀect). A few atoms, ions and molecules, in which the
angular momenta of the electrons do not cancel, possess an intrinsic dipole. which is
much larger than the induced moment at room temperatures. These molecules tend to
adopt the least energy state in which the intrinsic dipole moment is parallel to the ap-
plied ﬁeld (the paramagnetic eﬀect). The intrinsic paramagnetic dipole is much larger
that the induced diamagnetic dipole at room temperatures, so paramagnetic molecules
are often introduced as ‘agent’ molecules in order to eﬀect a deliberate modiﬁcation
of the applied ﬁeld. However, the magnetic ﬁeld experienced by a nucleus in the host
atom is modiﬁed by the ﬁelds produced by all the molecules external to the molecule
in which it is located and by the internal ﬁeld produced by the molecule itself. The
former is therefore dependent on the the composition and geometry of the sample and
is a macroscopic eﬀect, the latter solely on the structure of the particular molecule and
is a microscopic eﬀect. The change in resonant frequency due to the former eﬀect is
called the bulk susceptibility shift (BMS) and that due to the latter is the chemical
shift. Figure to illustrate a chemical shift and susceptibility shifts caused by spherical
and cylindrical geometries.

Both eﬀects are the result of the electromagnetic properties of charges in motion and
are governed by Maxwell’s equations (cf. Jackson, 1999). In microscopic form, these de-
termine the electric ﬁeld e and the magnetic induction b produced by each constituent
charged particle. This is the approach employed to ﬁnd the internal ﬁeld contribution
and the chemical shift. However, it is not feasible to solve the microscopic Maxwell
equations for all the other molecules in the vicinity, let alone all those in the sample.
It is therefore necessary to invoke the macroscopic Maxwell equations. These deter-
mine the electric ﬁeld E and the magnetic induction B, given the so-called constitutive
relations between the electric ﬁeld and the electric displacement D and between the
magnetic induction and the magnetic ﬁeld H. These relations incorporate the eﬀects
due to the paramagnetic and diagmagnetic properties of the medium described above.
But the ﬁeld calculated from the macroscopic Maxwell equations does not provide the
average ﬁeld at the location of a nucleus because the macroscopic ﬁeld at any point
contains a contribution from that the molecule in which the nucleus resides. In fact,
it contains a contains an average contribution of that molecule averaged over points
external to the molecule. In order to calculate the ﬁeld experienced by the nucleus, this
average external contribution must be removed. The result is an estimate the average
ﬁeld across a molecule due to the applied ﬁeld and the contributions of all the other
molecules. This is known as the local ﬁeld. The ﬁeld at the nucleus is then obtained
by adding the internal contribution of the molecule itself.

Analytic Strategy

The commonly used prescription for estimating the local ﬁeld is based on the idea
of the sphere of Lorentz (e.g. Chu et al. (1990), Springer (1994), Levitt (1996)). It

3

was introduced in the case of electrostatics but applies equally to both electrostatic
and magnetostatic cases (e.g. Feynman et al. (1964)). It was ﬁrst used in the NMR
context by Dickinson (1951). The sphere of Lorentz is a notional sphere drawn around
a nucleus; it is large enough for all the molecules external to the sphere to be treated
as a macroscopic continuum which is locally uniform. Within the sphere, the host
molecule is imagined to sit in a vacuum surrounded by individual molecules whose net
electromagnetic eﬀect is assumed to be vanishingly small. The eﬀect of introducing a
spherical cavity into a uniform continuous medium is, however, signiﬁcant but is easily
calculated. It then provides the estimate of the local ﬁeld. The disadvantage of the
approach is that it mixes the microscopic and macroscopic pictures and the justiﬁcation
for the estimate is obscure. It has thus assumed an almost ‘magical’ air; Springer (1994)
writes ‘For an imaginary object, the Sphere of Lorentz produces amazingly profound
real eﬀects’.

Aims, Approach, and Outcomes

In this paper, we de-mystify the estimation of the local ﬁelds from the macroscopic
ﬁelds and show that the result obtained from the sphere of Lorentz argument is of quite
general validity. It requires only that the measurement sample suﬃcient molecules in
random positions with respect to neighbours for the sample average to be equivalent to
the average of a single molecule surrounded by a randomized medium. Local isotropy,
i.e. spherical symmetry, then produces the same result as the sphere of Lorentz con-
struction for a nucleus sitting in the otherwise empty space at its centre. We ﬁrst
summarize the derivation of the macroscopic ﬁelds, which average the eﬀect of all
molecules present over a macroscopic length and/or time scale. On the microscopic
scale, all charged particles are in motion so that the electric and magnetic properties
are coupled and we have to analyse the full set of Maxwell equations. It is only on the
macroscopic scale that experiments can realize time scales suﬃciently long that the
macroscopic equations governing the magnetic ﬁeld may be solved independently of
those governing the electric ﬁeld. At this point, we shall therefore restrict our discus-
sion to the magnetic ﬁeld in the quasi-steady case. We then examine how the average
ﬁelds produced by all the other molecules at the site of a particular molecule can be
estimated from the macroscopic equations. The solution of the macroscopic equations
is summarized in the Appendix so that the calculation of the bulk susceptibility shift
in NMR experiments can be discussed.

The detailed treatment of the chemical shift produced by the internal ﬁeld of the
molecule at its nucleus is beyond the scope of this paper (see for example, Dickinson
(1951), Ramsey (1952), Springer (1994)) but, for completeness, we provide an estimate
in the spirit of the treatment of the bulk susceptibility shift so that the combined eﬀects
can be assessed.

Microscopic and Macroscopic Fields

Maxwell Equations

Maxwell’s equations are treated in all standard texts on electromagnetism (e.g. Jack-
son, 1999) so we will focus here only on the conceptual steps involved in proceeding
from the microscopic picture in which the molecular constituents of the material are
described as charged particles in motion in a vacuum, for which the solutions can be
written down exactly, to the macroscopic picture, which involves systematic approxi-
mation. Only thus will the relationship between the two pictures be exhibited. Because
there are several steps which are logically independent, we will use a notation that,
although somewhat cumbersome, does keeps track of them.

The development followed by Jackson is based on Russakoﬀ (1970). Maxwell’s equa-
tions are linear equations, hence they can be averaged over space or time to describe
the average microscopic electric and magnetic ﬁelds ˜e and ˜b in terms of the sources,
the charge density ˜ρ and current density ˜j, averaged in the same manner; namely,

ǫ0∇ · ˜e = ˜ρ ,
∇ · ˜b = 0 ,

where c is the speed of light, t′ = t − |x − x′|/c is the retarded time and the integration
is taken over all space. In a steady state, only the ﬁrst terms of the right-hand side of
(2) and (3) appear so that the electric ﬁeld depends only on the charge distribution and
the magnetic ﬁeld only on the current distribution. The relative size of the second to
ﬁrst terms is 1 : (d/cτ ) where d and τ are characteristic distance and time scales of the
system. If the system changes only slowly, i.e., over scales long compared with d/c, the
time for light to travel a distance d, the second terms and the variation in the retarded
time can be neglected. This we call the quasi-steady case. In NMR experiments, the

5

(3)

diﬀusion time scale is governed by the thermal speeds of the molecules which are much
smaller than c. Hence the quasi-static approximation will apply.

Temporal and Spatial Averages

Linearity ensures that the ﬁelds obtained by averaging the sample point over a volume
in space or interval in time are precisely those measured at a ﬁxed point due to sources
averaged over the same volume or time interval. As a further consequence of linearity,
the average ﬁelds and sources of any system are equal to the sums of the average
ﬁelds ˜ei and ˜bi due to to the average sources ˜ρ and ˜ji representing each of the N
N
i=1 ˜ei. Each average molecular
molecules present in the system. For example, ˜e =
ﬁeld is governed by the Maxwell equations (1) with the corresponding average molecular
sources.

P

The i-th molecule will consist of ni charged particles, electrons and protons, as well
as neutrons which generate no electromagnetic eﬀects. We shall not be interested in
following the submolecular motion, so we ﬁrst average over a time scale which is long
compared with that of the orbital motion of the electrons, but short compared with that
of the motion of the centre of mass of the molecule. We then write the time-averaged
quantities with an overbar as

¯Xi(x, t) =

Xi(x, t − τ )w(τ ) dτ ,

Z

w(τ ) dτ = 1, and
where the temporal smoothing function w(τ ) is normalized so that
vanishes for time scales longer than that of the submolecular motion. Treating each
submolecular particle as a discrete point charge, the charge and current density due to
the j-th charge in the molecule can be expressed in terms of the delta function as

R

ρij(x) = qijδ(x − xi(t) − ξij(t))
jij(x) = qij( ˙xi(t) + ˙ξij(t))δ(x − xi(t) − ξij(t)) .

(4)

Here xi(t) and ˙xi(t) are the position and velocity of the centre of mass of the i-th
molecule, qij is the charge of the j-th submolecular particle in the i-th molecule and
ξij(t) and ˙ξij(t) are the position and velocity of the j-th submolecular particle in the
i-th molecule with respect to its centre of mass.

Multipole Expansion

At a point external to the molecule, |x − xi| > |ξij| so we can approximate the ex-
pressions in (4) using just the ﬁrst two terms of the multipole expansion. This is the

6

dipole approximation and yields for the total charge and current densities for the i-th
molecule

These expressions demonstrate that, when averaged over time, the molecule appears
at distant points as if it were a point object. However, it is conceptually convenient
(though not mathematically imperative) to restore the ﬁnite extent of the molecule
when we deal with the immediate neighbourhood of an individual molecule in what
follows, so we will smooth the i-th molecule over a volume Vi comparable to that
occupied by the molecule. The spatially smoothed quantities are denoted by a double
overbar,

¯¯Xi(x, t) =

¯Xi(x − ζ′

, t)hi(ζ′

) d3ζ ′ ,

Z Z Z

where hi describes the shape of the smoothing function around x. It vanishes outside
Vi and is normalized so that its integral over Vi is unity.

The Maxwell equations with these averaged sources will then describe ﬁelds that vary
smoothly over length and time scales greater than those of the submolecular structure.
The sources and ﬁelds still have structure on the scale of the intermolecular distance.
The macroscopic equations eliminate this ﬁne structure by smoothing over a volume V
of space that is now large enough to contain a large number of molecules. The newly
smoothed quantities are denoted by angle brackets,

h ¯¯Xi(x, t)i =

¯¯Xi(x − ζ, t)hV (ζ) d3ζ ,

Z Z Z

where hV is another normalized function which vanishes outside V . In order to simplify
the treatment, we shall take the smoothing function to be uniform over V so that
hV = 1/V . Then we must restrict the integration to the volume V around x, writing

h ¯¯Xi(x, t)i =

(13)

At this point, we have made the usual assumptions that the molecular charges qi and
charge ﬂuxes qi ˙xi will sum to zero over a macroscopic volume, so the expressions for
both the average charge density and average current density depend solely on the dipole
terms. The second term in the expression for the average current density is the spatial
average of the (vector) product of the dipole moment and the centre of mass velocity
of the molecules. If there is no correlation between the dipole moment and the velocity
(one is microscopic, the other is macroscopic) then the average of the product is equal
to the product of the averages. In this case, if there is no bulk motion in the system, the
average velocity of the centre of mass will vanish and the macroscopic current density
will reduce to

h¯j(x, t)i =

Local and External Fields

Averaging Process for Fields and Sources

The ﬁelds experienced locally at the site of an individual molecule within the material
will diﬀer from the macroscopic ﬁelds deﬁned above because the macroscopic ﬁeld con-
tains an averaged contribution from the molecule itself. The macroscopically averaged
ﬁelds experienced by the k-th molecule are found simply by solving the macroscopic
equations with sources from which the averaged contribution of that molecule has been
subtracted. It is not obvious, however, that the local ﬁelds will always, if ever, be these
spatially averaged macroscopic ﬁelds. In the case of a crystal with molecules arranged
in a regular lattice, there will be no spatial smoothing and the local ﬁelds will be similar
for all similar molecules and will diﬀer greatly from the macroscopic average. They
can be estimated only by solving the full microscopic equations for the whole lattice.
This problem will not be discussed further here. In an amorphous solid with random
structure, an individual molecule will again not experience spatially smoothed local
ﬁelds. But if we consider a group of similar molecules with random arrangements of
surrounding molecules over the volume V used to deﬁne the macroscopic average, the
local ﬁeld experienced by the group will, on average, be similar to the macroscopically
averaged ﬁelds. The mean ﬁelds experienced by a smaller group (in a smaller volume)
will, in general, diﬀer from the macroscopically averaged ﬁelds since they will retain

9

structure on the molecular scale. The evaluation of the local ﬁelds in the latter case
poses an intractable problem.

The question of how to estimate the mean local ﬁeld thus hinges on the nature of the
averaging process. In a ﬂuid, the molecules move around in time, so a temporal average
is equivalent to averaging over the locations of the molecules, i.e., to spatial averaging
around a ﬁxed site. If a ﬁnite volume containing a large number of molecules with host
atoms is sampled, each such molecule will be surrounded by other molecules in a series
of random realizations. The local ﬁeld averaged over such an ensemble of realizations is
again equivalent to a spatial average around a ﬁxed site. The distribution of surround-
ing sources is then locally uniform and isotropic within the averaging volume V . This
property characterizes the macroscopic average and deﬁnes how large the necessary
macroscopic averaging volume should be. We shall consider this case exclusively.

Let us focus on this averaged spatial distribution of sources in the neighbourhood of a
molecule which will be labelled k. In order to maintain the identity of the molecule,
we assume that it occupies a volume Vk about xk from which all other molecules are
excluded. We now smooth the molecules outside this volume over a spherical volume
V in order to produce a continuous distribution which maintains the volume Vk free
of sources. As before, we shall take the smoothing function to be uniform over V .
If V does not contain Vk, the sources will be averaged over the whole of V so that
hV = 1/V at points inside V and hV = 0 outside. Then the spatially averaged sources
contributing to (9) and (10) will take the form

X(x, t) =

(20)

The prime on the sum indicates that the term i = k must be omitted. The second
expression follows from the ﬁrst because ¯¯Xk vanishes throughout V . It is precisely the
deﬁnition of the macroscopic average h ¯¯Xi in (8).

Smoothing Over Sources in the Neighborhood of a Host Molecule

If we smooth over a volume that includes any part of Vk we must conﬁne the sources to
the volume V less V ′
k, which is that part of Vk within V . This volume depends on the
position of the centre of the smoothing sphere x relative to the centre of the molecule
xk. The normalization now gives hV = 1/(V − V ′

Now, the ﬁrst integral is the total source QV within V . Since V is the macroscopic
volume, this source is given by (20) as QV = V h ¯¯Xi. The molecules will be randomly
distributed over this volume with an average number density 1/Vm, where Vm is the
average molecular ‘volume’ so we can deﬁne the average source associated with each
molecule to be

scalar measuring the ratio of the total sources, another quantity that depends on the

Alternative Representation of the Sources

These results can be put in a more illuminating form by noting that they diﬀer from

of Vk. The local ﬁelds are therefore obtained from the macroscopic ﬁelds E and B by
removing the ﬁelds due to the contribution of the k-th molecule to the sources within
Vk and around Vk. We refer to these as the ‘self-ﬁelds’ and are produced by the sources

This provides a prescription for evaluating the local ﬁeld experienced by an individual
molecule surrounded by a randomized conﬁguration of other molecules. The equations

may be solved if the structure and dynamics (position, orientation and velocity) of the
molecule are known. In practice, the dynamical state of individual molecules will not
generally be known, so this formalism has limited application. However, in experiments
such as thus employing NMR techniques, the signal is generated by a large number of
nuclei residing in molecules in diﬀerent dynamical states. We can therefore perform

ﬂux of the molecules in question, i.e.
there is negligible bulk motion, the velocity
dependent terms will average to zero. If we also average over orientation, the newly
averaged sources must be distributed with spherical symmetry. The molecule is thereby
replaced by one which is spherically symmetric. The molecular volume Vk will then be
a sphere and all spatially dependent factors in the shape functions S will depend only
on distance from the centre of the symmetrized molecule r = |x − xk|.

Letting R be the radius of V and Rk the radius of Vk, we can now write the charge
densities as

where P and M are the macroscopic polarization and magnetization around x = xk.

Isolated Molecules

First consider the idealized case in which we have a single species (so αk = 1 and
qk = 0) and set Vk = Vm and fX = 0 so that each molecule occupies the same exclusive
spherical volume equal to the molecular volume. Then the shape functions vanish
and we are left only with the uniform sources P and M within Vk. Substitution into
the quasi-steady expressions (18) and (19) yields explicit estimates of the self-ﬁelds at
x = xk,

Eself = −

P(xk, t) ,

Bself =

M(xk, t) .

(22)

The contribution from the polarization P to Bself integrates to zero at the centre
of the sphere. This does not occur at other points within the sphere. However, in
the strictly time-independent case, the ﬁelds are uniform within a sphere with uniform
polarization and magnetization so (22) estimates the static self-ﬁelds ﬁelds at all points
within the sphere. This case reproduces the result obtained from the ‘sphere of Lorentz’

13

construction, even though the spheres are diﬀerently conceived and of diﬀerent size.
The contradictions inherent in this simplistic view of the sphere of Lorentz are apparent,
however, so we will pursue the rigorous treatment.

Rigorous Treatment

If we wish to identify values averaged over V in the general case with the macroscopic
averages, we must take V >> Vk. The macroscopic sources are then uniform through-
out Vk and its surroundings within the much larger volume V about the molecule. Thus
in the surrounding shell, only the shape functions vary and then only on the radial co-
ordinate r. The importance of this property was noted by Levitt (1996); substitution of
these forms in (18) and (19) produces exactly the same estimates (22) for the ﬁelds at
the centre of Vk. Away from the centre, the time-varying polarization will again Bself.
In the strictly time-independent case, the ﬁelds will again be uniform throughout Vk,
so these estimates will apply at all points within Vk.

We thus ﬁnd the completely general result that the static local ﬁelds thus experienced
by any x within an averaged molecule in averaged surroundings are

Eloc(x) = E(x) +

P(x) ,

Bloc(x) = B(x) −

M(x) .

(23)

These expressions will also approximate the time-varying ﬁelds close to the centre of
the molecule.

Alternative Expression for the External Field

An alternative form for the local ﬁelds can be obtained by recognizing that our as-
sumptions allow us to rewrite (13) as

P = N ¯pm , M = N ¯mm ,

(24)

where N is the number density of molecules and ¯pm and ¯m are the mean molecular
electric and magnetic dipole moments. Then

Eloc = E +

In the case of diamagnetic and paramagnetic molecules, which are of almost exclusively
of interest in NMR experiments, the local ﬁelds experienced by a molecule determine
its microscopic molecular electric and magnetic dipole moments. The mean moments
of all the molecules in the sample are linearly related to the external ﬁeld by

¯pm = γeǫ0Eloc ,

where γe is the average molecular polarizability and γm is the average molecular mag-

have the dimension of volume. Substituting for the local ﬁelds from (25) we ﬁnd that
the moments are aligned with the macroscopic ﬁeld,

¯pm =

The local ﬁelds can now be evaluated directly from the macroscopic ﬁelds using (32),
where the macroscopic ﬁelds are found by solving the Maxwell equations (17) together
with the constitutive relations (30).

So far, we have developed the theory of local ﬁelds for both the electric and magnetic
ﬁelds for two reasons. Firstly, the treatment of the electric and magnetic eﬀects is

15

(27)

(28)

(29)

(30)

(31)

(32)

exactly parallel and, secondly, because the two are coupled when the system is varying
in time. However, in NMR applications, the system is in a stationary state macroscopi-
cally. Then the equations governing the electric and magnetic ﬁelds decouple, allowing
the one to be treated independently of the other. From now on, we shall restrict atten-
tion to the static magnetic ﬁeld. Then the calculation of the local magnetic ﬁeld from
(32) requires the macroscopic ﬁeld B. This is found from the macroscopic Maxwell
equations; the time-independent equations are

∇ · B = 0 , ∇ × H = 0 , B = µH = µ0(1 + χ)H = µ0(H + M) .

Their formal solution is treated in standard texts such as Jackson (1999) and is outlined
in the Appendix.

Host Field

General

The macroscopic ﬁelds are calculated using the approximation in (5) and (6) which
is appropriate for points a long way from the system of charges constituting each
molecule. When calculating the ﬁelds experienced by the nucleus of the host atom,
there will be a contribution from the system of charges constituting the atom and the
molecule to which it may be chemically bound. This requires us to evaluate the ﬁelds
at an internal point of an atom or molecule. Due to the proximity of the sources, these
ﬁelds will generally be stronger than those generated by the other, distant, molecules.
Their eﬀect on the NMR resonance frequency, called the chemical shift, is likely to be
greater than that of the local ﬁeld, which produces the bulk susceptibility shift. The
internal ﬁeld must therefore be determined with care for each atomic nucleus in each
molecular species and requires the full panoply of quantum mechanics. This has been
applied by many authors from Ramsey (1950) onwards and is beyond the scope of this
paper. However, the eﬀect may be illustrated by a crude model.

Simple Model

In the absence of an applied ﬁeld, their will be no preferred direction for a molecule
and so the averaged sources will have a distribution with spherical symmetry about
any ﬁxed reference point, the nucleus in the host atom, for example. If we assume that
the positive charge on the atomic nucleus resides at the centre, the averaged electron
cloud will be appear as a spherical shell around it. In the presence of an external ﬁeld,
the ﬁrst-order perturbation of the spherical shell will be a dipole term with axis in
the direction of the applied ﬁeld. Take the preferred direction to be that of the unit

16

vector k. We can take the nucleus as the origin of the coordinate system without loss
of generality. Then the mean charge density due to the electrons about the nucleus
can be written as

¯ρk(x, t) = ρ0(r, t) − ρ1(r, t)k ·

x
r

,

where r = |x| is the distance of the point x from the centre. The charge density is
here a negative quantity and the centre of the distribution is shifted in the negative
k direction due to the Lorentz force due to the local applied ﬁeld. The mean current
density can likewise be written

¯jk(x, t) = j1(r, t)

k ×

.

x
r

(cid:17)

(cid:16)

Note that the spherically symmetric current term vanishes and the ﬁrst-order term
is a circular current system about the axis k. When j1 is positive this represents a
paramagnetic eﬀect; when negative, it represents a diamagnetic eﬀect.

The quasi-steady ﬁelds at the origin are found by substituting these forms into the
appropriate terms of (2) and (3) and performing the integrations, giving

The internal electric ﬁeld is always antiparallel to the electric dipole moment and the
internal magnetic ﬁeld is always parallel to the magnetic dipole moment. The exact
relationship between the dipole moments and the internal ﬁeld, of course, depends on
the electronic structure of the molecule. The result can be written in terms of the
eﬀective volumes of the molecule Ve and Vm, deﬁned by

These relationships arise essentially from dimensional arguments. Similar expressions
will therefore arise in the more complicated cases that arise when the host atom is chem-
ically bound to a molecule. Averaging all possible orientations will produce charge and

17

current distributions with spherical symmetry about the reference point, the nucleus
of the host atom. The local ﬁeld will produce ﬁrst-order perturbations of these distri-
butions, which give rise to net dipole moments and to the related internal ﬁeld at the
centre, i.e., the nucleus of the host atom.

Discussion

Sphere of Lorentz Argument

We have shown above that the ‘sphere of Lorentz’ argument does indeed estimate the
ﬁelds, both electric and magnetic, at points within a molecule embedded in a macro-
scopic sample composed of other molecules. However, our derivation does not depend
on any ad hoc spherical construction. Rather, it demands that we do not attempt to
estimate the ﬁelds experienced by an individual molecule, but the average ﬁelds expe-
rienced by a large collection of similar molecules so that both the dynamical properties
of the molecule and the locations of the neighbouring molecules are randomized. Under
these circumstances, the microscopic electromagnetic sources in the close vicinity of the
molecule will display spherical symmetry as do the macroscopic. It is the assumption
of spherical symmetry that produces the very general results (23), not sphericity. This
explains why the radius of the assumed sphere of Lorentz is irrelevant; the properties
within a sphere of any radius drawn around the centre of molecule will be symmetric
and lead to the same result. Our argument is, however, not independent of scale. The
macroscopic properties of the material are required to be locally uniform, so the size of
the macroscopic smoothing volume has to be chosen to ensure this homogeneity. This
volume has to be large enough to randomize the contribution of the least abundant
molecular species; the smoothing volume will be least when all the molecules are of the
same species.

Chemical Shift

It is immaterial whether the host atom in which the point is located, is chemically
bound in a larger molecule or not. However, the nucleus in the host atom will experi-
ence, on average, ﬁelds which are the sum of the local ﬁelds (23) and the internal ﬁelds
(33). The size of the internal ﬁelds will, of course, depend on the molecular environ-
ment of the host atom. Nevertheless, the dipole moments of the atom or molecule to
which it may be bound are linearly related to the local ﬁelds as in (26) but with the
mean molecular polarizability and magnetizability replaced by the quantities speciﬁc
to the type of molecule in question, k say. Substituting, we ﬁnd the nuclear ﬁelds to

Now N is the number of molecules per unit volume so 1/NV the ratio of the average
intermolecular volume to the volume of the molecule, as deﬁned by (). In ﬂuids this
ratio is of the order of 10, falling to unity when the molecules are densely packed. The
other factor is the ratio of the speciﬁc to the mean value of γ. If there is only a single
species present, this ratio is unity so the internal ﬁeld contribution will be an order
of magnitude greater than the bulk susceptibility contribution. If the molecules are
diamagnetic, γm < 0 the internal ﬁeld reduces the ﬁeld experienced by the nucleus so
the eﬀect is referred to as diamagnetic shielding. If the molecule is paramagnetic, γ > 0
and the nuclear ﬁeld is enhanced. When there are several species of molecule present,
the internal contribution depends on the properties of the molecule in question relative
to the average. It will be greatest when the molecule to which the host atom is bound
is strongly paramagnetic whilst the mean is weakly diamagnetic. These considerations
simply emphasize the need to have accurate estimates of the internal ﬁeld at the site
of the nucleus of the host atom when the molecule is averaged over orientation. The
required analysis are now very sophisticated (see Springer (1994)).

Further subtleties can arise from long-distance eﬀects. Nuclear spins have negligible
eﬀect locally (Dickinson (1951)) but appear to have a collective eﬀect globally (Levitt
(1996)). These are again beyond the scope of this discussion.

Illustrative Example

Susceptibility-Induced Shifts

In the following we will consider only the evaluation of the local ﬁeld and the sus-
ceptibility shift. Wolber et al. (2000) outline a procedure for calculating the eﬀective
magnetic ﬁeld to estimate NMR shifts in blood samples. They start from a system in

19

which a uniform strong ﬁeld B0 is produced in a material of susceptibility χ0. There
is then uniform magnetization given by (31) in the material. If a sample with suscep-
tibility χs is now introduced, the new ﬁeld B will be the sum of the original ﬁeld and
the ﬁeld B′ due to the change in magnetization,

inside the sample and

where S is the surface of the sample. As noted before, these equations do not fully
determine the ﬁelds generally. For a full solution, it is usual to solve the Laplace
equation (71) with appropriate boundary conditions for the scalar potential (e.g.
in
Kuchel and Bulliman (1989)). However, (40) does provide a useful approximate form
when the susceptibilities are very small. In practice, χ is of order 10−7 so that |B′|/|B0|
is also of order 10−7. Hence to ﬁrst order in small quantities we can write

The integral over the surface of the sample is a function solely of the geometry of the
surface. In general it is a function of the position x of the point within the sample.
For ellipsoidal surfaces (including the special case of a spherical surface), however, the
result is independent of x so the ﬁeld within the sample is uniform. For a sphere

where Ds is the geometric demagnetizing factor of Wolber et al. For a sphere, D = 2/3.
For an inﬁnite cylinder aligned at right angles to the ﬁeld, D = 1/2. Of course, there
is no surface eﬀect for a cylinder aligned parallel to the ﬁeld and D = 1. A table
of such factors is provided by Chu et al. (1990). The geometric factor is a constant
at all points within these objects and in all objects with ellipsoidal surfaces (Kuchel
and Bulliman (1989)). The ﬁeld is thus uniform within them. For other objects, the
geometric factor will be a function of position and the ﬁeld will not be uniform. In
either case, we can write the macroscopic ﬁeld as

B = (1 + (χs − χ0)Ds) B0 ,

(47)

and the local ﬁeld as

to ﬁrst order in the susceptibilities. This gives the local ﬁeld in absolute terms. The
expression agrees with Chu et al. (1990) but agrees with Equation (1) in Wolber et al.
only if the original material is taken to be the vacuum, i.e. χ0 = 0.

Sample Heterogeneity

Wolber et al. also consider the case in which the sample is heterogeneous, consisting
of plasma and erythrocytes. If the sample is averaged over a volume large enough to
contain many erythrocytes, the system can be considered to be uniform with a volume
average susceptibility

χb =

Veχe + Vpχp
Ve + Vp

,

(49)

where the subscripts e and p denote erythrocyte and plasma respectively and Ve is the
average volume of an erythrocyte and Vp the average volume of plasma surrounding
each erythrocyte. In order to account for the detailed distribution of erythrocytes in
the neighbourhood of the nucleus in question, these authors surround the site by a
sphere Σ comparable in size to the averaging volume. The source outside this sphere
will contribute at the centre an approximate ﬁeld, the ‘far’ ﬁeld, according to

by taking an alternative macroscopic average over a volume smaller than that of an
erythrocyte but larger than that of any internal structure. This ensures that the
susceptibilities χb and χp are uniform within the erythrocyte and the surrounding
plasma respectively. Then the changes of magnetization within the sphere

according to whether the point lies in plasma or erythrocyte. However, the sphere will,
by construction, intersect a large number of erythrocytes and so the integral may be

To ﬁrst order in the susceptibilities, the local ﬁeld experienced by a nucleus in the

This corrects and generalizes Equation (5) in Wolber et al. These authors introduced
a further term to describe the contribution of the particles within a sphere of Lorentz
drawn about the nucleus within the erythrocyte then argued that it vanished because
of symmetry. We showed above that the contribution is in fact included in the esti-
mate of the ‘local’ macroscopic ﬁeld if the particles are randomized within the ‘local’
macroscopic volume surrounding the nucleus, so the ﬁnal result is the same.

Wolber et al. go on to claim that B′′′ vanishes due to symmetry. However, in gen-
eral, there will be no symmetry in the distribution of the other erythrocytes about the
selected example. An exact evaluation is then impossible. We argue that this contri-
bution can be estimated only if the experiment samples enough erythrocytes (either
in volume or time) that the conﬁguration external to any individual erythrocyte is
randomized. Then the structured medium can be replaced by a homogeneous medium
with a mean susceptibility given by (49). In this case,

This is, of course, exactly the same result that would be obtained by ignoring the ﬁrst
spherical construction and applying (69) directly to the surfaces deﬁning the selected
erythrocyte and the sample volume. The selected erythrocyte is, on average, completely
surrounded not by plasma alone but by plasma containing other erythrocytes, so the
susceptibility in the surrounding medium is χb, not χp. If we set χ0 = 0, we obtain

Conclusions

Finally, let us consider the validity of the assumption of spherical symmetry for the
molecule averaged over orientation. Exact spherical symmetry would result if there
were no preferred direction. However, the applied ﬁelds do provide preferred directions
and the molecules are distorted systematically as a result. These departures from
spherical symmetry will lead to a second-order correction to the estimate of the local
ﬁeld. But the ﬁrst-order eﬀect estimated above is of order χ ≈ 10−7 so second-order
eﬀects will be of order χ2 ≈ 10−14 and will be quite negligible. Expressions (23)
therefore provide very accurate estimates of the averaged local ﬁelds. We have shown
that these are well-deﬁned constructs and allow the bulk susceptibility shift to be
calculated.

In practice, an NMR experiment will sample a large number of nuclei in a macroscopic
volume over a macroscopic time interval and each will experience a ﬂuctuating envi-
ronment as the neighbouring molecules move around. As a result, the molecules will
not experience a single average ﬁeld but a spread of ﬁeld strengths. This ﬂuctuation
will appear as a broadening of the resonant signal about the mean calculated here. In
principle, the size of the ﬂuctuations can be estimated rom the breadth of the resonance
if the geometrical factors are accurately known.

Appendix

The steady-state solution for the magnetic ﬁeld is given by the ﬁrst term in (19).
Remembering that the integration is performed over all space, this can be transformed
into two alternative forms by integrating by parts and assuming that the surface integral
vanishes suﬃciently far from the system. These are

B = ∇ ×

Z Z Z

(cid:18)

Z Z Z

M(x′) · (x − x′)
|x − x′|3

d3x′

.

(cid:19)

(65)

These two forms are equivalent for arbitrary volumes.

The ﬁrst form displays the construction of the ﬁeld from the vector potential

A(x) =

Z Z Z

µ0

M(x′) × (x − x′)
|x − x′|3

d3x′ ,

since the Maxwell equation ∇ · B = 0 guarantees that we can write B = ∇ × A.

which exhibits the construction from the scalar potential

ΦM =

Z Z Z

M(x′) · (x − x′)
4π|x − x′|3

d3x′ .

since the Maxwell equation ∇ × H = 0 guarantees that we can write H = −∇ΦM .

If M is everywhere diﬀerentiable and the integral is taken over all space, the scalar
potential can be rewritten as

ΦM = −

Z Z Z

∇x′ · M
4π|x − x′|

d3x′ ,

which is the solution over all space of the Poisson equation

∇2Φm = ∇ · M .

(67)

If space contains media with discontinuous distributions of M, the ﬁeld may be deter-
mined from either of the two equivalent forms of (65), but the volume integrals need
to be evaluated with some care.

Suppose space is divided into n regions with volumes Vi within which Mi(x) is diﬀer-
entiable. Let Vi and Vj have a common surface Sij, which may have zero extent. Then
we can transform the vector potential to obtain a contribution from both within each
volume Vi and from each surface Sij,

A =

Here the magnetization Mi(x′−) in the surface integral is evaluated just inside the
volume Vi, the primed sum excludes the term with i = j and nij is the outward normal
from Vi to Vj on Sij.

If the magnetization is uniform within Vi, ∇×Mi = 0 within Vi and the volume integral
vanishes. If the medium is uniform so χi is constant within Vi, then ∇ ×Mi = χi∇ ×H
within Vi. In the magnetostatic case, the volume integral will again vanish.

If space is composed only of such regions,

where now Mj(x′+) is now evaluated just outside the volume Vi. The quantity
∆Mij(x′) = Mj(x′+) − Mi(x′−) is the jump in magnetization as the boundary Sij is
crossed from Vi to Vj (in the direction of nij) at the point x′.

The ﬁeld follows immediately,

where M is the appropriate magnetization at the point x.

In this form it is easier to implement the boundary conditions when the materials are
diamagnetic or paramagnetic. In either case, M · n is the normal component of the
magnetization at the boundary and

∆Mij · n =

(χj − χi)
µ0(1 + χj)(1 + χi)

B(x′) · n ,

since Maxwell’s equations require the normal component of B to be continuous across
a boundary.

Hence,

B =

This appears to be an equation which deﬁnes B implicitly everywhere but it cannot be
implemented as such because it does not deﬁne the discontinuous tangential component
of B ﬁelds on the surfaces Sij. The general method of solution when ∇ · M = 0
everywhere is to solve (67) with vanishing right-hand side,

∇2ΦM = 0 .

(71)

This is Laplace’s equation. The boundary conditions to be imposed on ΦM at the
surfaces between the diﬀerent media are fully determined by Maxwell’s equations.

Time-resolved spectra of polar-polarizable chromophores in solution

A recently proposed model for steady-state spectra of polar-polarizable chromophores is extended
to describe time-resolved spectra. The model, based on a two-state picture for the solute and
on a continuum overdamped description for the (polar) solvent, grasps the essential physics of
solvation dynamics, as demonstrated by the comparison with experimental spectra. The solute
(hyper)polarizability is responsible for spectroscopic features that cannot be rationalized within
the standard picture based on a linear perturbative treatment of the solute-solvent interaction.
In particular, the temporal evolution of band-shapes and the appearance of temporary isosbestic
points, two common puzzling features of observed spectra, are natural consequences of the molecular
hyperpolarizability and of the consequent coupling between solvation and vibrational degrees of
freedom.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Time-resolved spectroscopy is a powerful tool to inves-
tigate solvent dynamics1,2, one of the central issues in
modern chemical physics, and a key to understand the
rate of chemical reactions in solution3,4. Detailed infor-
mation on solvent dynamics can in fact be obtained from
time-resolved spectra of properly chosen probe molecules
in solution. Good solvation probes have strongly sol-
vatochromic and intense absorption (and/or emission)
bands in the visible region5, as not to interfere with tran-
sitions in the ultraviolet region. Polyconjugated chro-
mophores with good electron-donor (D) and acceptor (A)
groups (also called push-pull chromophores) work ﬁne in
this respect: intense and low-lying transitions are guar-
anteed by polyconjugation, and the large charge displace-
ment from D to A (or viceversa) driven by the transition
is responsible for a large variation of the dipole moment
upon excitation, that makes the frequency of the transi-
tion largely dependent on the polarity of the surrounding
medium.

In the simplest model for solvation, the solvent is de-
scribed as a dielectric continuum medium hosting so-
lute molecules into Onsager-type cavities6. The electric
dipole moment of the (polar) solute polarizes the sol-
vent so that the solute itself experiences an electric ﬁeld,
the reaction ﬁeld, proportional to the solute dipole mo-
ment via a proportionality constant that depends on the
macroscopic properties of the solvent, and on the shape
and size of the Onsager cavity. Two contributions to
the reaction ﬁeld can be distinguished7,8. The electronic
clouds of solvent molecules surrounding the solute de-
formate in response to the solute dipole moment. The
resulting electronic polarization is very fast with respect
to the relevant degrees of freedom of the solute. As a con-
sequence, the dynamics of the electronic polarization is
irrelevant to our discussion9. The second contribution to
the reaction ﬁeld originates from the reorientation of the
(polar) solvent molecules around the solute. This contri-
bution, that of course vanishes in non-polar solvents, is
slower than the solute degrees of freedom6,7. It is respon-
sible for the large solvatochromic behavior of push-pull

chromophores5 and dominates the temporal evolution of
observed spectra in time-resolved experiments1.

In a typical time-resolved experiment the system is
shot by a pulse, or a series of pulses, that induces a transi-
tion between the ground and the excited state (or vicev-
ersa). During this process the solvent molecules have
not time to reorient in response to the sudden change
of the solute dipole moment, and an out of equilibrium
(orientational) polarization is generated. Provided the
state generated by impulsive excitation lives long enough,
the orientational contribution to the reaction ﬁeld (For)
slowly evolves from its initial value (i.e. that equilibrated
with the solute dipole moment before excitation), to-
wards the equilibrium value for the state reached upon
excitation. Within linear perturbation theory, the energy
of the states involved in the transition is linearly aﬀected
by the reaction ﬁeld, and the frequency of the relevant
transition acquires a linear dependence on the reaction
ﬁeld: ¯hω(For) = ¯hω(For = 0)
µG), where
µG(E) is the electric dipole moment of the ground (ex-
cited) state6. Then, the experimentally accessible tem-
poral evolution of the transition frequency, ω(t), gives
direct information on the temporal evolution of the ori-
entational solvent polarization.

The continuum dielectric model reduces the highly ir-
regular and complex motion of the solvent molecules to
the motion of a single eﬀective solvation coordinate, the
reaction ﬁeld10. The dynamical behavior of this special
coordinate is subject to large frictional random forces,
that guarantee for an energy dissipation mechanism4. In
the hypothesis of large friction (overdamped motion) the
resulting dynamics is very simple. The solvation corre-
lation function (also called the spectral correlation func-
tion),

has in this hypothesis a simple exponential form, and the
corresponding relaxation time, τS, coincides with the lon-
gitudinal relaxation time, τL, of the pure solvent1. Devi-
ations from this simple behavior are expected in the case
of low-friction or when the translational motion of solvent
molecules dominates over orientational motion1,11.

Extensive experimental work has been devoted by sev-
eral groups to collect time-resolved spectra of polar chro-
mophores in solution12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23. The
interpretation of experimental data proved more diﬃ-
cult than described in the simple picture summarized
above. First of all a ﬁnite contribution to the Stokes
)) is given by the vibrational degrees
shift (ω(0)
of freedom of the solute molecule, as demonstrated most
clearly by the observation of ﬁnite Stokes shifts for chro-
mophores dissolved in non-polar solvents.
Internal vi-
brational coordinates are in fact slower than electronic
degrees of freedom, and hence contribute to the Stokes
shift. However, thanks to the diﬀerent timescales of vi-
brational and solvation motions, their contributions to
the temporal evolution of spectra can be at least approx-
imately separated16. The basic idea is that, after im-
pulsive excitation, vibrational degrees of freedom relax
almost instantaneously with respect to solvation time-
scales, so that vibrational relaxation is essentially done
before solvent relaxation starts. Accordingly, the zero-
time frequency, ω(0), to be inserted into Eq. (1), is not
the true zero-time frequency, i.e. that relevant to the un-
relaxed (vertical) system, but represents the frequency
measured at an eﬀective zero-time for the solvation mo-
tion, i.e. the hypothetical time when vibrational coordi-
nates are fully relaxed, but the solvent is still frozen in
its vertical conﬁguration. This eﬀective t = 0 time, ﬁrst
introduced by Maroncelli and coworkers in the analysis of
time-resolved ﬂuorescence spectra24, has no experimen-
tal counterpart, and ω(0) cannot be measured directly.
Maroncelli proposed a clever approach to extract ω(0)
from experimental steady-state spectra collected in polar
and apolar solvents24. The procedure unavoidably intro-
duces uncertainties in the estimated ω(0) that add to the
uncertainties in the frequencies estimated from the broad
and asymmetric ﬂuorescence bands13. Precise estimates
of C(t) are therefore diﬃcult. On a more fundamental
vein, the simplest solvation model outlined above, and, a
fortiori, the approach suggested by Maroncelli, both rely
on the hypothesis of instantaneous vibrational relaxation
and on the hypothesis of an ideal solvation probe: i.e. of
a molecule whose spectral properties are largely aﬀected
by the surrounding medium, but whose presence does not
aﬀect the solvent dynamics. The assumption of a com-
plete separation of vibrational and solvation time-scales
is expected to work well unless one is interested in the
very early times of solvation (the ﬁrst few tens of fem-
toseconds). Deviations can be predicted for molecules
with very slow (conformational) degrees of freedom, par-
ticularly if solvents with very fast relaxation dynamics
are considered. The assumption of the solvent response
being unaﬀected by the perturbing solute is only valid
in the linear regime for the solute-solvent perturbation.
But linear approaches are inadequate to treat solvation
of push-pull chromophores. Just in view of the strong
absorption in the visible region, in fact, push-pull chro-
mophores have large polarizabilities (and hyperpolariz-
the reaction ﬁeld then not only aﬀects the
abilities):

2

solute energy, but also its dipole moment. The dipole
moment in turn aﬀects the reaction ﬁeld in a feed-back
mechanism that is responsible for large non-linearity.

In recent years we have developed a simple yet power-
ful method to describe steady-state electronic and vibra-
tional spectra of polar chromophores in solution25,26,27,28.
The solute is described in terms of two electronic states
linearly coupled to internal vibrations (Holstein coupling)
and to the reaction ﬁeld9. This model allows for non-
perturbative solutions and naturally describes several
features of experimental spectra that were not under-
stood in standard linear approaches. The reliability of
the model is proved by extensive comparison with steady-
state electronic and vibrational spectra collected for sev-
eral chromophores in diﬀerent solvents28,29,30. In this pa-
per we extend the model to describe time-resolved spec-
tra. In particular we show that accurate time-resolved
spectra of polar-polarizable chromophores can be cal-
culated adopting the same set of parameters used for
steady-state spectra without the need to introduce ad-
ditional adjustable parameters. Working in the hypoth-
esis of a complete separation of solvation and vibra-
tional dynamics, the model accounts for deviations of
C(t) from the simple exponential form, and rationalizes
the observation of time-dependent band-shapes and the
appearance of temporary isosbestic points (TIPs). These
characteristic features of time-resolved spectra of polar-
polarizable chromophores19,20,21,22,23, are a direct conse-
quence of the solute (hyper)polarizability, and cannot be
rationalized within the standard linear picture for sol-
vation outlined above. As a matter of fact these fea-
tures have often been taken as evidences of the failure
of the continuum solvation model13,14,15 or for the fail-
ure of the two-state description of the chromophore23.
We demonstrate instead that they can appear as natural
consequences of the molecular polarizability and can be
described within the simplest model for solvation, pro-
vided the fundamental interactions of electronic degrees
of freedom with molecular vibrations and with the sol-
vent reaction ﬁeld are treated beyond linear perturbative
approaches.

II. THE MODEL

molecular vibrations and to solvent degrees of freedom,

the coordinates and conjugated momenta describing the
coupled vibrations of the chromophore, and Q0 is the
eﬀective solvation coordinate. All coordinates are har-
monic, with frequency ωi; the relevant relaxation energy
is ǫi.
In the following we explicitly account for a sin-
gle coupled vibration, Q1. This simpliﬁes equations and
limits the number of adjustable parameters in the model,
with no major loss of accuracy in the calculation of elec-
tronic spectra28. The extension to the multimode case
is possible, and interesting eﬀects of the mixing among
diﬀerent vibrational coordinates are indeed expected in
vibrational spectra27,30.

In the adiabatic approximation, the Hamiltonian in
Eq. (2) can be diagonalized at ﬁxed Qi’s on the basis
states9,31. The resulting ground
of

The corresponding energies deﬁne the multidimensional
ground and excited state potential energy surfaces (PES),
as shown in Fig. 1a. The calculated PES are interest-
ing in several respects. All coordinates inserted into the
Hamiltonian are harmonic, and no term appears into
Eq. (2) explicitly accounting for the mixing of diﬀerent
coordinates. The PES in Fig. 1 are instead clearly an-
harmonic and indicate a large mixing between the two
involved coordinates. The softening of the ground state
PES, and the hardening of the excited state PES are also
recognized. All these eﬀects are due to the coupling of
the Qi’s to the electronic system27. In particular we un-
derline that the coupling between vibrational and solva-
tion coordinates stems out naturally from their common
coupling to the electronic system.

The PES in Fig. 1 represent the potential for the mo-
tion of slow coordinates, Qi’s. Internal vibrations with
typical frequencies in the mid-infrared region, are true
quantum-mechanical objects. The relevant anharmonic
problem deﬁned by the PES in Fig. 1 has been solved nu-
merically, and large eﬀects of the anharmonicity of inter-
nal vibrational modes have been demonstrated in static
hyperpolarizabilities32,33. On the contrary, vertical pro-
cesses, like, e.g., absorption and emission are hardly af-
fected by anharmonicity32,34,35.
In particular, vertical
processes are quite accurately described by replacing the
two anharmonic PES by the two parabolas that best ﬁt
the ground and excited state PES in the relevant region
of the Q space (best harmonic approximation32,33,34). Of
course the role of anharmonicity can be recognized in the
variation of the eﬀective harmonic parameters ﬁtting ab-
sorption and emission processes in this local-harmonic
approximation.

Within the local harmonic approximation, electronic
spectra and their variation in the Q-space are fully de-
ﬁned in terms of ρ. The vertical transition frequency and

absorption and emission, respectively.

The solvation coordinate describes the slow orienta-
tional motion of polar solvent molecules around the polar
solute. The relevant coordinate, Q0, can then be treated
as a classical coordinate, and, at ﬁnite temperature, it
is responsible for inhomogeneous broadening. Since the
solvation motion is coupled to electronic degrees of free-
dom, and, through them, to internal vibrations, inhomo-
geneous broadening has in these systems quite peculiar
features. Due to thermal disorder in fact, the solution
can be thought of as a collection of chromophores each
one surrounded by a slightly diﬀerent Q0 conﬁguration.
Both electronic and vibrational motions are very fast if
compared to solvation, so that each solute molecule read-
justs instantaneously its polarity and its geometry in re-
sponse to the local Q0 conﬁguration27. Thermal disorder
in Q0 is then responsible for disorder in electronic and
vibrational properties, that shows up in electronic and
vibrational spectra, and, most apparently, in the anoma-
lous dispersion of resonant Raman frequencies with the
excitation line27,29. With reference to Fig. 1, the ther-
mally equilibrated state in either the ground or excited
state PES is deﬁned in terms of a Boltzmann distribu-
tion of states lying along the dashed lines drawn across
the isopotential lines in Fig. 1b and 1c to mark the local
minimum path with respect to the vibrational coordi-
nate. The steady-state absorption and emission spectra
are then sums of the contributions in Eq. (6) calculated
for each point along the minimum path in the ground
state and excited state PES, respectively, and weighted
by the relevant Boltzmann distribution27,28.

This simple model has been applied successfully to de-
scribe electronic and vibrational spectra of several chro-
mophores, reproducing many features of experimental
spectra that were not understood before28,29,30. Just as
an example, Fig. 2A and 2B shows the absorption and

emission spectra calculated in the proposed approach to
ﬁt experimental spectra of DCM dissolved in several sol-
vents. These spectra accurately reproduce experimental
data28, and deserve some comment. The red-shift of ab-
sorption and emission bands with increasing solvent po-
larity (positive or normal solvatochromism) is typical of
chromophores with a neutral ground state (ρ < 0.5)5.
For these chromophores the solute polarity increases
upon excitation, and the excited state is stabilized by
a polar surrounding medium. The evolution of the band-
shape with the solvent polarity is a more subtle phe-
nomenon that can be understood only if the polarizabil-
ity of the solute is accounted for27,28. In fact, the polarity
of the (polarizable) solute increases with the polarity of
the surrounding medium. For neutral chromophores then
ρ increases towards 0.5, and HR factors decrease: even
if inhomogeneous broadening increases with the solvent
polarity, absorption and emission bands apparently nar-
rows, since the underlying vibronic proﬁle narrows (λ1
decreases, see Eq. (5)). For zwitterionic chromophores
(ρ > 0.5), instead, the ionicity increases towards 1, and
HR factors increase with the solvent polarity: in this case
the eﬀects of solvent polarity on inhomogeneous broad-
ening and HR factors sum up to widen absorption and
emission bands. This behavior is experimentally veriﬁed
in dyes with inverse solvatochromism20,37,38, and is re-
produced in Fig. 2C and 2D for a hypothetical dye with
the same molecular parameters as DCM, but a diﬀerent
z0, as to have a zwitterionic ground state.

Another direct consequence of the molecular polariz-
ability is recognized in the non-specularity of steady-
state absorption and emission bands25,28. The behav-
ior is similar for neutral and zwitterionic chromophores,
with narrower emission than absorption bands.
In all
chromophores, in fact, the mixing between the two basis
states increases in the relaxed excited state, so that, in
both cases steady-state emission spectra correspond to
states with ρ nearer to 0.5 than states relevant to ab-
sorption spectra. According to Eq. (5), HR factors for
emission are always smaller than for absorption then jus-
tifying quite naturally the observed narrowing of emission
bands.

III. RELAXATION DYNAMICS

The success of the two-state model

in reproducing
steady-state absorption and emission spectra invites
modeling time-resolved experiments, as related to the
dynamics of non-equilibrium states created by impulsive
excitation in either the ground or excited state PES. We
are not interested in the fast relaxation of vibrational
coordinates (typically accomplished within few tens of
femtoseconds after excitation)16,22, rather we model the
slower solvation dynamics in the hundreds of femtosec-
onds to picosecond temporal window. The problem is
therefore greatly simpliﬁed if we work in the hypothesis
of a complete separation of vibrational and solvation dy-

4

namics. First of all, just after a (sequence of) pulse(s) has
created an out of equilibrium state in one of the PES, an
instantaneous relaxation of vibrational coordinates takes
place before solvation relaxation starts16. Moreover, dur-
ing the subsequent relaxation of solvation degrees of free-
dom, internal coordinates immediately readjust with re-
spect to the instantaneous conﬁguration of the solvent.
Due to the non-linearity of the coupled problem, the elec-
tronic wavefunction readjusts following Q0 and, as a con-
sequence, the equilibrium geometry of the chromophore
varies with Q0. Since electronic and vibrational degrees
of freedom are much faster than solvation, they are al-
ways in equilibrium with the instantaneous conﬁguration
of the solvent, and the relaxation of the eﬀective solva-
tion coordinate does not proceeds along a horizontal line
(ﬁxed Q1) in Fig. 1b or 1c, but follows the dashed lines
drawn across the isopotential lines to mark the minimum
energy path in each surface.

→

G’

In a time-resolved ﬂuorescence experiment, an impul-
sive excitation drives the system from the thermally equi-
librated ground state (centered on point G in Fig. 1b)
to the vertical excited state (point G’ in Fig. 1c). Af-
ter excitation, the instantaneous relaxation of vibrational
degrees of freedom drives the system to point F, i.e.
to the local minimum in the excited state PES, at the
Q0 relevant to the equilibrium ground state conﬁgura-
tion. During the G
F path, the Q0 conﬁguration
is unaﬀected. Once the system has reached point F, sol-
vent relaxation starts. Since vibrational degrees of free-
dom follow adiabatically the solvent relaxation, the re-
laxation path towards the minimum of the excited state
PES (F
E) follows the minimum energy path, i.e. the
dashed line drawn across points F and E in Fig. 1c. So, in
spite of being driven by orientational degrees of freedom
of the solvent, the dynamics of the system occurs along
an eﬀective coordinate that describes a concerted motion
of solvation degrees of freedom and internal vibrations.
Once again, the coupling between the two kinds of motion
originates from their common coupling to the electronic
system, and is a direct consequence of the molecular po-
larizability.

→

Time-resolved ﬂuorescence spectra can be calculated
following the same procedure described in the previous
section for steady-state spectra, provided the temporal
evolution of the Q0 probability distribution is known. To
such an aim we rely on a Fokker-Planck description of
the dynamics of the joint probability distribution in the
space of the solvation coordinate and momentum39,40,

where V (Q0) is the (classical) potential for the Q0 mo-
tion. We veriﬁed that for γ > 2ω0 the Smoluchowski
equation leads to the same results as the Fokker-Planck
equation. Apart from a simpliﬁcation in the integration
procedure, working in the overdamped limit has the ad-
vantage of reducing the number of free parameters re-
quired to model solvation dynamics. In fact, as it is well
known40 and as we have explicitly veriﬁed, in that limit
all dynamic properties depend on γ and ω0 only through
the ratio τ = γ/ω2
0. τ represents an eﬀective solvation
time, and can be ﬁxed as the longitudinal relaxation time
(τL) of the pure solvent1.

Fig. 3 shows time-resolved spectra calculated for DCM
dissolved in two diﬀerent solvents (CH3CN and CHCl3).
All molecular parameters, and the solvent relaxation
energies as well, are kept ﬁxed at the values previ-
ously obtained from the ﬁt of steady-state spectra28
(cf Fig. 2, left panels). According to literature data,
we ﬁx τ = 0.3 and 2.8 ps for CH3CN and CHCl3,
respectively16. The spectra in Fig. 3 compare nicely
with experimental spectra17,18, and accurately reproduce
the progressive red-shift of the band, as well as its nar-
rowing. In order to better understand the origin of the
evolution of band-shapes during solvation, Fig. 4 shows
time-resolved spectra calculated for the same parameters
as Fig. 3A, but without accounting for inhomogeneous
broadening, i.e. by collapsing the w(Q0) distribution into
a δ-function. The comparison between inhomogeneously
broadened spectra in Fig. 3A and homogeneous spectra
in Fig. 4 demonstrates that the evolution of the band-
shape accompanying the solvent relaxation is essentially
due to the evolution of the vibronic structure (i.e. of
HR factors), and reﬂects quite naturally the evolution of
the molecular geometry along the relaxation path. The
w(Q0) distribution, obtained from the solution of the
Smoluchowski equation, also evolves with time, but it
aﬀects calculated spectra in a more subtle way. In fact
w(Q0) is responsible for inhomogeneous spectral broad-
ening, whose temporal evolution is hardly recognized in
the fairly broad emission spectra of polar chromophores
in polar solvents.

Similar features, including the progressive red-shift of
the emission band and its narrowing, are recognized in
time-resolved emission spectra of many other dyes, in-
cluding neutral dyes like coumarin 15316, and zwitteri-
onic dyes like LDS-75012. In fact, in spite of the oppo-
site solvatochromism, neutral and zwitterionic dyes are

5

predicted to have similar behavior with respect to time-
resolved emission, as demonstrated by the time-resolved
spectra calculated in Fig. 5 for the same zwitterionic dye
whose steady-state absorption and emission spectra are
reported in Fig. 2, right panels. Both the red-shift and
the narrowing of time-resolved emission bands are due to
the increase of the mixing between the two basis states
during the relaxation of the system along the eﬀective
solvation coordinate, as discussed in the previous section
with reference to steady-state spectra.

Other time-resolved experiments can be described
within the proposed approach. Transient hole-burning
experiments have been designed to follow the relaxation
along the ground state PES. Speciﬁcally, we make ref-
erence to the experiment described in Ref. 22.
In this
experiment, a solution of coumarin 102 (C102) dissolved
in CH3CN is impulsively excited to transfer population
from the minimum of the ground state PES (point G in
Fig. 1b) to the vertical excited state (point G’ in Fig. 1c).
After a delay time long enough as to allow for the com-
plete relaxation of the system in the excited PES (from
G’ to E in Fig. 1c), a second dump pulse is applied to
vertically transfer the equilibrated population in the ex-
cited state PES into the ground state PES (from E to E’
in Fig. 1b). We are not interested in modeling the ini-
tial relaxation of vibrational coordinates occurring dur-
ing the ﬁrst few tens of fs22, but, much as it was done for
time-resolved ﬂuorescence, we want to model the slower
spectral evolution due to the solvent relaxation. We then
assume an instantaneous (within the relevant solvation
timescale) relaxation along the vibrational coordinate,
towards point R in the ground state PES (Fig. 1b) lying
on the local minimum path with respect to Q1. The cal-
culation of transient absorption spectra then goes via the
solution of the Smoluchowski equation for w(Q0) from
time zero (where the equilibrium w(Q0) relevant to the
excited state PES is rigidly translated to point R in the
ground state PES) towards the ground state equilibrium
in G.

Figure 6 shows transient diﬀerential absorption spectra
calculated for C102 in CH3CN. Molecular parameters for
C102, as well as the solvent relaxation energy relevant to
C102 in CH3CN, are obtained from the ﬁt of steady-state
absorption and emission spectra41. The additional pa-
rameter entering the Smoluchowski equation, τ , is again

duce not only the blue-shift of the band, but also the
appearance of a TIP, and its temporal evolution. The
origin of TIPs is easily recognized in the variation of the
band-shape of the transient absorption that accompanies
its progressive blue-shift. Whereas the rigid translation
to the blue of the transient absorption band is quite eas-
ily understood based on the simplest linear model for
solvation, the temporal evolution of the band-shape is

a direct consequence of the molecular polarizability. In
fact, as long as the system relaxes along the R-G path in

Fig. 1b, the molecule readjusts its polarity (from ρ
to 0.16, in the speciﬁc case of C102 in CH3CN), and HR
factors relevant to the absorption process change with
time. TIPs are puzzling features of time-resolved spectra
that cannot be explained easily within the standard pic-
ture for solvation, but are a natural consequence of the
polarizability of the solute molecule.
commonly
pump-probe
in
experiments19,20,21,23.
In these experiments, after
the application of a pump pulse that drives the system
to the excited state PES, the variation of the optical
density of the solution is monitored by a probe-beam as
a function of the delay time after the pulse. The exper-
iment is easier than the hole-burning experiment, but
the interpretation of resulting spectra is more complex.
In fact at least three processes can contribute to the
observed signal at each frequency. Both the bleaching
of the absorption from the ground state (due to the
reduced ground state population) and stimulated emis-
sion decrease the optical density, leading to a negative
signal, whereas the absorption from the excited state
increase the optical density, originating a positive signal.
A reasonable separation of the diﬀerent contributions is
only possible if the three processes occur in well sepa-
rated spectral regions. For polar chromophores in polar
solvents, the large Stokes-shifts guarantee in general a
reasonable discrimination between signals originating
from the bleaching of the ground state absorption and
from stimulated emission.
If the positive signal from
excited state absorption does not interfere too much,
the pump-probe experiment gives information on the
evolution of the emission band during the relaxation of
the system along the F-E path in the excited state PES
(Fig. 1c), so that, in favorable cases, the pump-probe
experiment gives similar information as time-resolved
ﬂuorescence. According to the previous discussion, we
then predict a progressive red-shift and narrowing of the
emission band, in quite good agreement with available
experimental data for several chromophores, with either
a neutral19,21,23 or a zwitterionic ground state20. We
underline once more that the red-shift of the stimulated
emission band is easily rationalized in the standard
solvation model. On the opposite, the narrowing of the
band, being related to the variation of the molecular
polarity with the solvent relaxation, can only be under-
stood in models where the molecular polarizability is
properly accounted for. The concomitant red-shift and
narrowing of the emission band are responsible for the
appearance of TIPs in observed spectra.

IV. DISCUSSION

Push-pull chromophores are interesting molecules
in several respects:
they ﬁnd application as solva-
tion probes2,5, as laser-dyes, and as chromophores for

6

non-linear optics42. They are also good two-photon
absorbers43 and work as molecular rectiﬁers44. From a
theoretical point of view, the possibility to describe the
electronic structure of these molecules in terms of an ef-
fective two-state model makes these systems fascinating
model systems to understand electron-transfer in solution
and speciﬁcally to investigate the physics of solvation in
electron-transfer processes4,45,46,47. In a series of recent
papers9,25,27,28, we have extended the standard two-state
model for push-pull chromophores48,49,50 to account for
solvation and molecular vibration. The model allows for
a non-perturbative treatment of the relevant couplings
and fully accounts for the solute (hyper)polarizability,
yielding to a successful picture for steady-state spectra
of push-pull chromophores in solution28,29,30. Here we
extend the model to time-resolved spectra and demon-
strate the important role of the solute hyperpolarizabil-
ity in several characteristic and non-trivial spectroscopic
features.

Consider a simple system with no electron-vibration
coupling. Due to the molecular (hyper)polarizability, the
reaction ﬁeld aﬀects the solute properties and, in turn, is
aﬀected by the presence of the solute. As a consequence
of this feedback interaction, the ground and excited state
PES for the Q0 motion are deformed35. The linear po-
larizability (αG/E) is responsible for a renormalization of
the relevant harmonic frequencies27:

ΩG/E = ω0

while higher order polarizabilities originate anharmonic
corrections32,33 that can be fairly large for chromophores
with large NLO responses. The role of the molecular
ﬁrst polarizability, α, on solvation dynamics is easily
understood and has already been discussed by several
authors51,52,53,54. If the hyperpolarizability is neglected,
the PES are harmonic and the solvation relaxation func-
tion, C(t), has a simple exponential form. The relax-
ation time, τG/E = γ/Ω2
G/E, is however renormalized
with respect to the relaxation time of the pure solvent,
τ = γ/ω2
0, and depends on speciﬁc properties of the so-
lute. A qualitatively diﬀerent behavior is expected if hy-
perpolarizabilities are accounted for, leading to anhar-
monic PES. In this case, a non-exponential C(t) is ex-
pected, whose detailed behavior depends the details of
the relevant PES. The role of the solute hyperpolariz-
abilities on solvation dynamics has not been recognized
so far and the observed deviations of C(t) from the sim-
ple exponential behavior have always been ascribed to the
failure of the continuum model for the solvent or to the
underdamped nature of the solvation coordinate13,14,15.
Instead a non-exponential behavior can show up within
the simplest model for solvation, as a consequence of the
solute hyperpolarizability.

The molecular (hyper)polarizability has even more im-
portant eﬀects in the presence of coupled internal vibra-
tions.
In fact the common coupling of vibrational and
solvation degrees of freedom to the electronic system in-

duces a mixing between the two kinds of coordinates,
even if no direct coupling between the modes is included
in the hamiltonian. The physical origin of the mixing
lies in the molecular (hyper)polarizability: the polariz-
able molecule in fact readjusts its polarity to any vari-
ation of solvation or of vibrational coordinates, but this
variation of polarity aﬀects in turn all coordinates, lead-
ing to an interdependence of all motions. As discussed
in the previous section, even in the simplifying hypoth-
esis of a complete separation of the timescales of vibra-
tional and solvation motion, the relaxation of the sol-
vent coordinate always implies, for a polarizable solute,
a concomitant relaxation along the vibrational coordi-
nates. Therefore time-resolved experiments performed
on polarizable chromophores measure a complex motion
where the molecular geometry readjusts following the sol-
vent relaxation. Deviations of the observed relaxation
time from the relaxation time of the pure solvent, as well
as deviations from the simple exponential behavior for
C(t), are obviously predicted in this model. Just as an
example, Fig. 7A compares the spectral correlation func-
tion calculated for hole-burning experiment on C102 de-
scribed in the previous section. Deviations of the exact
result from the simple exponential behavior, as well as an
overall slowing down of the solvation dynamics with re-
spect to the pure solvent, can be appreciated from the ﬁg-
ure, even if, due to the large experimental uncertainties in
C(t), they are possibly too small to be safely identiﬁed in
experimental data. Larger eﬀects are predicted for more
polarizable solute molecules, as shown in Figure 7B for
phenol blue, an interesting solvatochromic probe whose
large hyperpolarizability is known since date55. Quite
irrespective of their magnitude, these eﬀects are impor-
tant since they demonstrate that the presence of a po-
larizable solute aﬀects solvation dynamics: the relaxation
time obtained from the spectral relaxation function is not
a property of the pure solvent, but also depends on the
solute molecule. Good solvation probes should be largely
solvatochromic and hardly polarizable as well.

The two-state model unavoidably assigns the excited
state a linear polarizability equal in magnitude and oppo-
site in sign to the ground state polarizability, then point-
ing to a solvation time in the excited state smaller than
the longitudinal relaxation time of the pure solvent. As
discussed in Ref. 56 the negative polarizability of the ex-
cited state is probably an artifact of the two-state model,
that neglects the mixing of the low-lying excited state
with higher excited states whose (positive) contribution
to αE usually over-compensate the negative contribution
from the mixing with the ground state. Estimates of
excited state polarizabilities are available for just a few
chromophores and all conﬁrm positive αE values57,58.
However, the possibility of observing a negative α for the
excited state of highly polarizable chromophores cannot
be excluded a priori. In any case, it is possible to modify
the proposed approach to account for the role of (a few)
higher excited states. However, this would introduce new
adjustable parameters in the model, whose deﬁnition is

7

arbitrary in the absence of accurate experimental infor-
mation on the polarizability of the excited state, or on
the relaxation dynamics in the excited state.

The analysis of C(t) is hindered by large experi-
mental uncertainties, and the eﬀects of the solute (hy-
per)polarizability are more easily recognized in the tem-
poral evolution of band-shapes. As recently suggested
by Matyushov54, if one accounts for the solute linear po-
larizability, the diﬀerent curvatures in the ground and
excited state PES lead to diﬀerent equilibrium w(Q0)
distributions in the two states. Then a temporal evo-
lution of w(Q0) is easily predicted in time-resolved ex-
periments, resulting in an evolution of the inhomoge-
neous broadening proﬁles in observed spectra. The so-
lute hyperpolarizability makes the phenomenon more
complex: anharmonic PES, as originated by non-linear
polarizabilities32,33, in fact lead to non-Gaussian distri-
bution proﬁles. However, it is important to recognize
that, as discussed in the previous section, band-shapes
inhomoge-
are actually governed by vibronic proﬁles,
neous broadening being only responsible for their smear-
ing out. The observed evolution of band-shapes is in-
deed originated by the coupling between solvation and
vibrational degrees of freedom, as induced by the molec-
ular (hyper)polarizability. The role of vibronic proﬁles in
deﬁning observed band-shapes was recognized in Ref. 59,
but the temporal evolution of HR factors was introduced
ad hoc. We demonstrate instead that it is a natural con-
sequence of the solute (hyper)polarizability.

The evolution of band-shapes that accompanies the
red- (blue-) shifts of time-resolved ﬂuorescence (absorp-
tion) bands can be responsible for a crossing of ob-
served spectra. The resulting TIPs are not true isos-
bestic points, as their location smoothly varies with time.
In any case, the appearance of TIPs has puzzled exper-
imentalists and theorists since date19,20,22,23. Recently,
a paper appeared aimed to demonstrate the failure of
the two-state picture for push-pull chromophores, based
on the appearance of TIPs in pump-probe spectra23. In
this paper, TIPs are ascribed to a barrier-activated re-
action occurring in the excited state towards a transient
emissive product. Whereas further theoretical and exper-
imental work is needed to settle this point, we underline
that the molecules investigated in Ref. 23 are among the
best chromophores for NLO, and are therefore largely
(hyper)polarizable. The observed large deviations of re-
laxation times from the longitudinal relaxation times of
the pure solvents, point quite nicely to deviations from
the standard linear perturbative picture of the solute-
solvent interaction and perfectly ﬁt within our two-state
model for polar-polarizable chromophores, and suggest
an alternative explanation of TIPs.

V. CONCLUSIONS

Time-resolved spectra of polar-polarizable

chro-
mophores in solution are described based on a contin-

uum solvation model. A two-state picture is adopted
for the solute, and linear coupling to internal vibra-
tions is also accounted for. The model, originally de-
veloped to account for NLO responses9,31 and steady-
state spectra25,27 of push-pull chromophores in solution,
is extended here to describe time-resolved spectra. The
comparison with experimental data conﬁrms that the
proposed model quite successfully grasps the essential
physics of polar-polarizable chromophores in solution.
The model presents some obvious drawbacks. The two-
state picture must be extended to account for higher-
energy states if detailed information is required on ex-
cited state properties. Moreover, the Holstein model
for electron-vibration coupling only accounts for linear
terms: quadratic coupling is expected to be important
in cases when a very diﬀerent geometry (and hence very
diﬀerent bond orders) can be attributed to the two ba-
sis states. Again the extension of the model in this di-
rection is easy, but requires detailed spectroscopic in-
formation to ﬁx all the model parameters. Finally, the
continuum model for solvation has serious limitations,
particularly in cases were large site-speciﬁc interactions
(like, e.g., H-bonds) are expected. The hypothesis of
complete separation of vibrational and solvation time-
scales can fail for molecules with particularly slow inter-
nal degrees of freedom and/or for solvents with a very

8

fast dynamics.
In spite of these limitations, and quite
irrespective of its applicability to some speciﬁc systems,
the proposed model opens the way to obtain exact, non-
perturbative solutions of the solvation problem also in
the presence of electron-vibration coupling. The spectral
consequences of the molecular (hyper)polarizability, that
is unavoidably neglected in the standard linear perturba-
tive approach to solvation, are important and non-trivial,
and show up quite consistently in steady-state and time-
resolved spectra of push-pull chromophores.
In partic-
ular here we have demonstrated that deviations from
the exponential decay of the spectral relaxation func-
tion, that are usually taken as proof of the failure of
the continuum model for solvation, appear quite natu-
rally within the simplest picture, provided the molecular
(hyper)polarizability is accounted for. Similarly, the tem-
poral evolution of band-shapes, as well as the appearance
of TIPs, usually ascribed to the failure of the two-state
model, are another consequence of non-linearity. More
complex models can of course be developed, and will lead
to a better or more detailed description of spectral prop-
erties of push-pull chromophores in solution. Based on
an Occam-razor approach, we believe however that the
available body of experimental data does not require any
more complex physics than described here.

FIG. 6: Transient diﬀerential absorption spectra calculated for C102 in CH3CN: z0 = 1.28 eV, √2t = 1.2 eV, ǫ1 = 0.33 eV,
ω1 = 0.16 eV, ǫ0 = 0.6 eV. Spectra are relevant to the times reported on the graphs. Calculated spectra are shown in two
separate windows for a better comparison with data in Ref. 22. Arrows indicate the direction of increasing time.

FIG. 7: Solvation correlation function for the hole-burning experiment, calculated for (A) C102 in CH3CN (the same parameters
as in Fig. 6) and (b) phenol blue in CH3CN (z0 = 0.7 eV, √2t = 1 eV, ǫ1 = 0.42 eV, ω1 = 0.2 eV, ǫ0 = 0.7 eV, from Ref. 29).
Continuous lines refer to the exact results; dashed lines correspond to the non-polarizable-solute approximation; dot-dashed lines
have been calculated by taking into account the linear polarizability only; dotted lines correspond to the best single-exponential
ﬁt of the exact curve.

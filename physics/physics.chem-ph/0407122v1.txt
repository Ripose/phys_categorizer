We report spectra of various benzene isotopomers and their dimers in helium nanodroplets in the
region of the ﬁrst Herzberg-Teller allowed vibronic transition 61
0 transition) at
0
∼260 nm. Excitation spectra have been recorded using both beam depletion detection and laser-
induced ﬂuorescence. Unlike for many larger aromatic molecules, the monomer spectra consist of a
single “zero-phonon” line, blueshifted by ∼30 cm−1 from the gas phase position. Rotational band
simulations show that the moments of inertia of C6H6 in the nanodroplets are at least 6 times larger
than in the gas phase. The dimer spectra present the same vibronic ﬁne structure (though modestly
compressed) as previously observed in the gas phase. The ﬂuorescence lifetime and quantum yield of
the dimer are found to be equal to those of the monomer, implying substantial inhibition of excimer
formation in the dimer in helium.

INTRODUCTION

Among all molecules, benzene occupies a very special
place: it is an organic molecule, with its conjugated ring
forming the basis for a vast ﬁeld of chemistry; it is also
eﬀectively a very small molecule, partially owing to its
high degree of symmetry, and can thus be studied with
very high-resolution techniques, both theoretical1 and
experimental.2,3,4,5,6 In fact, the benzene monomer and
its isotopomers have been extensively studied since the
1960s, when Callomon et al.7 ﬁrst published a detailed
analysis of moderate-resolution UV absorption spectra of
room temperature benzene vapor. However, benzene van
der Waals interactions with itself and other molecules,8
which are relevant to both biochemistry and molecular
electronics, have proved more demanding because of the
nonrigid nature of most complexes formed with benzene.
In particular, the structure and internal degrees of free-
dom of the benzene dimer are still not ﬁrmly established.
In the present work we have studied benzene and
its dimer solvated in superﬂuid helium nanodroplets,
in order to further our understanding of these systems.
Much is known about the gentle solvation eﬀects in he-
lium nanodroplets,9,10 which allows us to interpret the

nanodroplet isolation (HENDI) has revealed rotationally
resolved spectra11,12 of many molecules, which has been
interpreted as a demonstration of the superﬂuid nature
of these droplets. Electronic spectra have been recorded
for a series of molecules,13 in particular for higher poly-
acenes (see Table II) and other aromatic molecules. In
the case of glyoxal, the observation of a characteristic gap
between the zero-phonon line (ZPL) and the phonon wing
provided the ﬁrst direct evidence for superﬂuidity in he-
lium nanodroplets.14 The same gap was also observed for
Na2 molecules located on the surface of the droplets.15
For many other molecules, the electronic spectra feature

several “zero-phonon” lines, whose origin has been ex-
tensively discussed in the literature.13,16,17,18,19,20 While
benzene has not been experimentally studied in helium
droplets before, several theoretical articles have appeared
on this subject.21,22,23

We have focused our studies on the A0

sition of benzene, which is the lowest Herzberg–Teller al-
lowed transition to the ﬁrst electronic excited spin-singlet
π∗ excitation). It occurs around 259 nm,

dropping the collector current over a 50 Ω terminator,
the PMT output was integrated for 20 ns (for lifetime
measurements) or 50 ns (spectra) with a SR250 boxcar
integrator, and the result fed into a SR510 lock-in am-
pliﬁer locked to a laser beam chopper running at 1/4 of
the laser repetition rate. The laser beam was chopped
to eliminate electrical pickup from ﬁring of the laser Q-
switch.

All spectra were measured with 1 Hz bandwidth on the
lock-in ampliﬁer, and recorded through a computer in-
terface with 1 Hz sampling rate. Typical scanning speeds
were on the order of 1 cm−1/min. The resulting data
(pairs of wavelength and signal amplitude) were Gaus-
sian smoothed with a standard deviation of 0.1 cm−1.

In all isotopomers of benzene we used, carbon isotopes
were present at natural abundances. C6H5D (98+%) and
s-C6H3D3 (sym-benzene-d3, 1,3,5-C6H3D3, 98%) were
purchased from Aldrich;38 C6D6 (99.5%) was purchased
from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories.39 All isotopomers
were used without further puriﬁcation. A 1H NMR spec-
trum of a C6H6/C6D6 mixture showed no signiﬁcant im-
purities.

III. BEAM DEPLETION SPECTRA

The recorded beam depletion spectra were assigned by
studying line intensities as functions of the dopant pres-
sure in the pickup cell, verifying the typical Poisson dis-
tribution expected for uncorrelated pickup events.40 We
will present and discuss the spectra in ﬁve sections, sepa-
rately considering the line shapes of the monomer, those
of the dimer, the complexes with argon, the droplet sol-
vation shifts, and the excitation of a totally symmetric
vibrational mode.

A. Monomer Spectra

The A0

∼

0 absorption lines of all the benzene monomer
isotopomers we have studied were found to present the
same vibronic ﬁne structure as in the gas phase, consist-
ing of a single absorption line within our experimental
resolution (two lines in the case of C6H5D, see Fig. 1).
Figure 2 shows the A0
0 beam depletion spectrum of C6H6
100; the linewidth is
with a signal-to-noise ratio of
0.53 cm−1 full width at half maximum (FWHM) and the
peak is at 38636.47 cm−1. No phonon wing was detected
within 15 cm−1 to the blue of the transition, and we es-
timate that at least 80% of the spectral intensity is in
the zero-phonon line. It has been shown for a variety of
molecules that droplet phonon wings are often weak and
require signiﬁcant saturation of the ZPL in order to be
evident (see Ref. 13 for a review). As our conditions are
π∗ va-
far from saturation (see Section V), and the π
lence excitation of benzene is relatively weakly coupled
to the ﬁrst helium solvation shell (see Section III D), our
inability to detect a phonon wing can be rationalized.

Diﬀusion Monte-Carlo (DMC) studies of the C6H6–
He14 system have predicted a multitude of excited states
of the ﬁrst helium solvation shell with energies of 10 to
20 cm−1 (Ref. 22). However, UV transitions to helium
excited states as computed in Ref. 22 are symmetry-
forbidden: helium excitations must be of A1g symme-
0 transition,41 which is mu-
try to be excited in the A0
tually exclusive with the POITSE (projection operator,
imaginary time spectral evolution) method of Ref. 22.
Therefore, any helium states computed in Ref. 22 are in-
visible in direct UV spectroscopy, and any A1g phonons
that we could potentially detect are not computable with
POITSE. However, the energy of the (L, M ) = (2, 0)
phonon, which can in principle be excited in the A0
0 tran-
sition, is unlikely to be very diﬀerent from that of the
12 kBK),
other L = 2 phonons computed in Ref. 22 (
judging from the small M -dependence of the energies of
the POITSE phonons in C6H6–He14. The energy of the
(L, M ) = (0, 0) phonon, on the other hand, cannot be in-
ferred easily because it involves a qualitatively diﬀerent
helium motion, being the only phonon that varies the
mean density of the helium in the ﬁrst solvation shell.
Pending a calculation of energies and Franck–Condon
factors for these excitations, we conclude that the lack
of phonon wings in our spectra are due to insuﬃcient
signal-to-noise ratios.

A comparison of the C6H6 A0

0 droplet spectrum to
a simulated gas phase spectrum at 0.38 K (the exper-
imental rotational temperature of molecules in helium
droplets),11,12 using the Hamiltonian of Ref. 6 (up to
J ′′ = 20), shows that the droplet spectrum is signiﬁ-
cantly compressed, suggesting that the eﬀective moments
of inertia of benzene are much larger in the droplet than
in the gas phase (see Figure 3). As shown in Fig. 4,
the droplet spectrum can be approximated by introduc-
ing two scaling factors κB (scaling B′ and B′′) and κC
0ζ′, and C′′) that describe the eﬀect of
(scaling C′, C′
the helium droplet on the rotational motion of the ben-
zene molecules. Smaller values of κB and κC result in
narrower spectra, with less recognizable structure due
to the Gaussian smoothing involved; since our spectrum
consists of only one peak, any values of κB and κC ex-
tracted from line ﬁts can only be interpreted as upper
limits. In this sense, we estimate that both κB and κC
are smaller than
1/6. This means that the eﬀective
moments of inertia of C6H6 in superﬂuid helium are at
least 6 times larger than in the gas phase. While a rigid
model of the ﬁrst solvation shell agrees with this limit
on κB, it overestimates κC : a rigid C6H6–He14 cluster,
with two helium atoms on the C6 axis 3.3 ˚A from the
origin and 12 helium atoms in two rings of 6 atoms each
located 3.9 ˚A from the origin at an angle of 45◦ from
the C6 axis, estimates κrigid

spectra of molecules in helium nanodroplets have been
recorded with similar linewidths,13 while purely vibra-
tional HENDI spectra routinely achieve a hundred times
smaller linewidths.12 In the case of benzene, the observed
line proﬁles are close to Gaussian, with little asymmetry
(see Figure 2). Rapid vibrational relaxation in S1 with
a lifetime on the order of 10 ps could account for the ob-
served linewidth, but it would lead to more pronounced
Lorentzian line wings. Inhomogeneous broadening due to
either the cluster size distribution42 or to translational
levels of the benzene molecules in the clusters43 is ex-
pected to result in asymmetric lines.

B. Dimer spectra

Figure 5 shows the A0

0 beam depletion spectra of all
benzene homo-dimers considered in this study. The
0.5 cm−1, very sim-
linewidths of all sharp features are
ilar to the 0.53 cm−1 linewidth of the C6H6 A0
0 line (see
Section III A).

∼

For the benzene dimer in the gas phase, not only
the A0
n vibronic progression can be observed, but the
reduced symmetry in the T-shaped dimer (see below)
makes also the electronic origin transition 00 very weakly
allowed. For (C6H6)2 in the gas phase, both the 00 and
A0
0 UV transitions are split, featuring two peaks of sim-
ilar linewidth and an intensity ratio around 1:1.4 (see
Refs. 44,45). The A0
0 transition also features a weaker
progression of modes spaced by about 17 cm−1, which
has been assigned to the stretching of the van der Waals
dimer bond.46 While we have observed neither the 00
transition nor the van der Waals progression in helium
droplets, the splitting of the A0
0 transition is present in
helium droplets with the same intensity ratio as in the
gas phase (see lowest graph in Fig. 5 and Fig. 6), though
modestly compressed. In (C6D6)2, the 00 and A0
0 tran-
sitions were found in the gas phase to consist of a sharp
line with a broader, weaker peak further to the blue,44,45
a pattern which again was reproduced in helium droplets.
Apart from a 20% smaller spacing for the two A0
0 lines
in (C6H6)2 (3.7 cm−1 in the gas phase, 2.90 cm−1 in he-
lium droplets), we conclude that the mechanism lead-
ing to the splitting is mostly unperturbed by the helium
droplet. This observation must be reconciled with the
large increase in the eﬀective moments of inertia of the
individual benzene molecules in helium (Section III A).

We will now try to establish what mechanisms can or
cannot lead to the observed benzene dimer splitting; we
will lead this discussion in a similar manner to that of
Ref. 8, where the same issues have been discussed for the
benzene dimer in the gas phase.

It was established in the gas phase work that the dimer
splitting is not due to two diﬀerent conformers with over-
lapping spectra, since the relative intensities do not de-
pend on source conditions.47 Further, the eﬃcient relax-
ation and long-range quadrupole-quadrupole alignment48

in helium droplets, which can align the two benzene
monomers over a distance of about 30 ˚A, would most
probably lead to intensity ratios diﬀerent from those seen
in jet spectra. More convincingly, hole-burning studies46
have been able to identify two weak secondary conformers
of (C6H6)2, none of which is the source of the dimer split-
ting and both of which are similarly split. We have not
been able to detect these conformers in helium droplets,
as expected due to their smaller intensities.

Microwave spectra49 have determined that the benzene
dimer is T-shaped, with a fast internal rotation around
the dimer axis which leads to a symmetric-top rotational
spectrum. Further arguments that favor a T-shaped over
a displaced-parallel dimer are (i) the perpendicular ori-
entation of nearest neighbors in solid benzene,50,51 (ii)
a permanent electric dipole in at least one conformer
of the benzene dimer,49,52 (iii) the demonstration that
the two benzene molecules occupy inequivalent sites in
the dimer,47,53 and (iv) recent CCSD(T)1 and AIMI54
ab-initio calculations. It is thus natural to suggest that
the splitting is due to absorption in the two inequiva-
lent monomers. However, studies of C6H6–C6D6 hetero-
dimers have shown44,46,53,55 that in the main A0
0 tran-
sition lines, the “stem” monomer is almost exclusively
excited, with a characteristically split spectrum, whereas
the spectrum of the “top” monomer consists of an ex-
100 cm−1) van der Waals progression with peak
tended (
intensities less than 10% of those of the “stem” monomer.
Therefore, the existence of inequivalent monomers can-
not account directly for the dimer splitting.

∼

The reduced symmetry of the “stem” monomer can
lift the degeneracy of E-type vibrations.56 In fact, the
molecules in solid benzene do not have sixfold symme-
try and their degenerate vibrational modes are split by
an amount very similar to the dimer splitting.51 While
a reduced symmetry would split the A0
0 transition (ν6 is
an E2g vibration), it cannot split the non-degenerate 00
transition, as observed in the gas phase. Unless the split-
tings of these two transitions have diﬀerent origins (which
is unlikely because of their qualitative similarity) we can
exclude symmetry breaking as a cause for the dimer split-
ting. Moreover, the ﬂuorescence lifetime of the benzene
dimer in helium droplets is found to be equal to that of
the gas phase monomer (Section IV), which would be un-
likely if the “stem” monomer was signiﬁcantly distorted
since this would decrease its ﬂuorescence lifetime. Note
that a ﬁrst-order perturbation of a degenerate vibronic
level will result in a line doublet of equal intensities, as
in the case of C6H5D (see Fig. 1); the very asymmet-
ric intensity patterns observed in the dimers, in particu-
lar for (C6D6)2, cannot be easily explained with such a
symmetry-breaking mechanism.

Excitonic interactions45,53 between the two benzene
monomers can be ruled out as the source of the dimer
splitting: the A0
0 spectrum of the C6H6–C6D6 hetero-
dimer44,46 has been found to consist mainly of two line
doublets, one doublet very similiar to the (C6H6)2 spec-
trum and the other similar to the (C6D6)2 spectrum. If

4

the splitting was due to exciton hopping, it would be
absent in hetero-dimers, where excitonic interactions are
non-resonant.

It is interesting to note that the reduced D3h symme-
try of s-C6H3D3 still allows for E-type symmetry species,
resulting in a single A0
0 absorption line (see Fig. 1). This
signiﬁes that, for most purposes related to the experi-
ments reported here, the s-C6H3D3 molecule can be re-
garded as standing halfway between C6H6 and C6D6.
The sequence of (C6H6)2, (s-C6H3D3)2, and (C6D6)2 A0
0
spectra show a decreasing splitting and an increasing line
intensity ratio. The regularity of this progression sug-
gests that the masses, and not the particular nuclear spin
weights, of the isotopomers determine their spectra.

While tunneling of the various intermolecular motions
in the dimer (librations and interchange) can lead to
splittings, these are too small in magnitude and in any
case limited by the associated rotational constant, which
can be no larger than 0.28 cm−1 (for rotation around
the inter-monomer axis). A tentative assignment of mi-
crowave spectra predicts small splittings of 15 or 30 kHz
due to interconversion tunneling;49 theoretical estimates
of various tunneling splittings are even smaller.1

The most probable explanation for the dimer split-
ting is librational motion. A theoretical analysis1 of
the T-shaped dimer predicts intermolecular vibrational
frequencies as low as 3.4 cm−1 for the torsion around
the dimer axis (i), and 4.8 cm−1 for the “stem” rotation
around its C6 axis perpendicular to the dimer axis (ii);
the interchange vibration (iii) is projected at 13.6 cm−1,
much larger than the observed splitting. In all of these
modes, the helium solvation shell increases both the ef-
fective mass (see Section III A) and the curvature of the
vibrational potential energy surface (one or two helium
atoms are expected to localize on either side of the “stem”
monomer,21 further attracted to the “top” monomer π-
cloud, thus hindering benzene dimer intermolecular mo-
tion). Sophisticated simulations, accounting for the ef-
fects of helium solvation and muclear spin statistical
weights,57,58 are called for in order to judge these as-
sumptions.

There are two ways in which librational motion can
lead to the observed dimer splittings. Firstly, conser-
vation of nuclear spin59 will populate several internal-
motion tunneling levels even at very low temperatures,
which will have diﬀerent spectra if there is a change in
the intermolecular force constants upon electronic exci-
tation. This has been conclusively ruled out as the ori-
gin of the dimer splitting by hole-burning studies46 of
the C6H6–C6D6 hetero-dimer. Secondly, excitation of a
varying number of librational quanta leads to a series of
absorption lines, which is what we believe is the origin of
the dimer splitting.

Microwave spectra suggest that in the gas phase, the
“stem” rotation around the dimer axis [mode (i)] has
such a large zero-point motion that the T-shaped benzene
dimer eﬀectively behaves as a symmetric top; in helium
droplets, however, this may not be the case since the he-

lium strongly suppresses rotational motion, as discussed
in Section III A. A study of selection rules and transition
moments is required in order to determine which libra-
tional mode can be excited in the A0
0 transition of the
dimer.

The added complexity of the (C6H5D)2 and (s-
C6H3D3)2 spectra is most likely due to the naturally
occurring diﬀerent conformers.
In (s-C6H3D3)2, the
“stem” monomer can have a hydrogen or a deuterium
atom pointing toward the “top” monomer, resulting in
two slightly diﬀerent conformers. Similarly, (C6H5D)2
has four conformers depending on the orientation of the
“stem” monomer.

C. Complexes with Argon

Apart from monomer and dimer spectra of benzene, we
have observed the A0
0 spectrum of the C6H6–Ar dimer:
Figure 7 shows a spectrum featuring C6H6, C6H6–Ar,
and (C6H6)2 absorptions. Despite several independent
attempts, no further complexes of benzene with argon
were detected.
In particular, we have tried to detect
(C6H6)2–Arn and C6H6–Ar2 complexes, in order to gain
structural information of the doped helium clusters.

In the gas phase, there are two conformers of C6H6–
Ar2, with both argon atoms on the same side of the
benzene plane (17 cm−1 redshift)60 or on opposite sides
(41.869 cm−1 redshift).61 In helium droplets, as in the
gas phase, the latter and more stable60 “sandwich” com-
plex is expected to coincide62 with the bluer one of the
two (C6H6)2 lines, since its redshift with respect to the
C6H6 absorption line is twice that of C6H6–Ar, assum-
ing the two argon atoms to be independent. A study of
the dependence of the dimer line ratio on argon pressure
in the second pickup cell (see Fig. 6) did not reveal any
signiﬁcant variation even for argon pressures that are op-
10−4 mbar), where
timized for about two pickups (
the signal of the C6H6–Ar2 complex should have an am-
plitude comparable to that of (C6H6)2. At this point we
are unable to explain the absence of these complexes.

D. Solvation and interaction shifts

Table I lists experimental transition energies measured
in helium droplets, along with the corresponding gas
phase values wherever known. Previously, all dimer
transition energies were given with respect to inaccurate
monomer lines, which have been determined from con-
tour ﬁts of room-temperature spectra (see, e.g., Ref. 7)
and are oﬀ by +2.4(2) cm−1 for C6H6 and +1.1(1) cm−1
for C6D6. The dimer transition energies listed in Table I
have been computed from the more accurate monomer
transitions of Refs. 6,63, assuming that the dimerization
shifts of Refs. 44,45 are accurate.

Table II summarizes experimental helium solvation
shifts of the smallest polyacenes, with an apparent ten-

dency of increased redshifts with increasing molecular
size. The C6H6 blueshift of +30.31 cm−1, as qualita-
tively predicted in Ref. 64, agrees with previous experi-
mental data on the A0
0 transition of the benzene–helium
system: rotationally resolved supersonic jet spectra of
C6H6–He and C6H6–He2, with the helium atoms on the
C6 axis, have found blueshifts of 2.31(2) cm−1 per he-
lium atom,2 and room-temperature spectra of benzene
10 cm−1
in high-pressure helium gas65 have measured a
blueshift at the helium density corresponding to that
of bulk liquid helium (21.8 nm−3). These shifts are a
combination of (i) a small dispersive redshift, due to
the small polarizability of the solvating helium and the
increased polarizability of benzene in the excited state
(see Table III), only slightly counteracted by a decreased
quadrupole moment, and (ii) a larger electronic blueshift
due to the expansion of the electron cloud against the
ﬁrst helium solvation shell upon excitation. In fact, the
helium atoms in C6H6–He and C6H6–He2 recede from the
benzene molecule by about 7–8 pm upon electronic exci-
tation of benzene.2 Note, however, that this expansion of
the electron cloud is not reproduced in the second mo-
ments of the benzene charge distribution (see Table III),
although the electronic excitation is more than halfway to
the ionization threshold (74556.57 cm−1).66 The ν6 vibra-
tional contribution to the droplet shift is probably much
smaller than the electronic contribution, and compara-
ble to the ν1 vibrational droplet shift of only +0.72 cm−1
(see Section III E).

The (C6H6)2 dimerization redshift (the wavenumber
diﬀerence between the monomer and averaged dimer
bands, both in helium droplets) is decreased to 35.7 cm−1
from the gas phase value of 42.3 cm−1 (Ref. 45). Sim-
ilarly, the C6H6–Ar complexation redshift is decreased
to 17.20 cm−1 from the gas phase value of 21.087 cm−1
(see Table I). These results are not easily explained:
in both cases we would expect a larger complexation
redshift in helium than in the gas phase, because (i)
the adducts replace helium atoms that contributed to
the 30.31 cm−1 blueshift of the benzene monomer, and
(ii) the van der Waals bond between the adduct and
the benzene monomer tends to be weakened in helium
droplets with respect to the gas phase, reducing the re-
pulsive dimerization blueshift. The latter point, sug-
gested by a decreased exciton splitting for (SF6)2 in he-
lium droplets,67 is substantiated by a density-functional
(DF) calculation of the C6H6–Ar system in a helium
droplet (500 helium atoms) assuming cylindrical sym-
metry (Ar located on the C6 axis of C6H6), using the
Orsay-Paris functional,68 with the CCSD(T) C6H6–He
potential from Ref. 69 (averaged cylindrically) and the
Ar–He potential from Ref. 70. At the C6H6–Ar equilib-
rium distance71 of 3.5 ˚A, the DF calculation estimates a
force of 1.8 pN pulling the moieties apart, resulting in a
slight bond stretching of 0.5 pm (assuming a harmonic
force constant of 3.5 N/m).71

E. A0

1 transition

For a C6H6 molecule in helium nanodroplets, the
wavenumber of one quantum of ν1 vibration added to
the ν6 excited state of S1 is 924.26 cm−1, compared to
923.538 cm−1 in the gas phase (see Table I). Both ν1 and
ν6 are mostly vibrations of the carbon ring, with the hy-
drogen atoms almost stationary;72 the very small droplet
blueshift of only 0.72 cm−1 suggests that these modes are
only weakly perturbed by the helium droplet. Moreover,
in the (C6H6)2 dimer, the shift between the center of
the two main lines of the A0
1 spectrum and the center of
0 lines (see Fig. 5) is 924.32 cm−1, almost indistin-
the A0
guishable from the monomer value of 924.26 cm−1. As
we excite mostly the “stem” monomer in these UV tran-
sitions (see Section III B), the ν1 vibration is only slightly
inﬂuenced by the presence of the “top” monomer.

The (C6H6)2 dimer splitting, as discussed in Sec-
tion III B, is reduced to 2.52 cm−1 in the A0
1 transition
(see the lowest panel in Fig. 5). Further, there is an ad-
ditional, weaker absorption line similarly spaced to the

transitions close to A0
1 (Ref. 73). This observation is con-
sistent with the proposed explanation of the dimer split-
tings through librational excitations, assuming that an
additional librational excitation becomes accessible due
to a modiﬁcation of the van der Waals interaction in the
ν6 + ν1 mode. If this assignment is correct, however, then
the above consideration about the ν1 energy in (C6H6)2
becomes questionable, since we do not know which lines
in the A0
0 spectrum correspond to which in the A0
1 spec-
trum.

IV. FLUORESCENCE EXCITATION SPECTRA

The ﬂuorescence excitation spectra yielded approxi-
mately the same energies for the monomer and dimer
transitions as the beam depletion spectra (see Fig. 2).
The small diﬀerences are line shape distortions due to
ﬂuctuations in the laser power, since the signal-to-noise
ratio of the ﬂuorescence excitation spectra was smaller;
these diﬀerences are not signiﬁcant for the following dis-
cussion.

By sweeping the delay of the boxcar integrator with
respect to the laser pulse, using a ﬁxed 20 ns gate
width, we determined the ﬂuorescence lifetime of the
C6H6 monomer to be 115(5) ns. This is compara-
ble to the 103 ns previously reported in jet expansion
experiments.28,56 The value of 103 ns is actually for the
electronic origin (00) excitation, whereas we are exiting
A0
0 (gas phase lifetime: 79 ns).28 However, the additional
vibrational energy probably relaxes rapidly into the he-
lium droplet, and thus we are seeing ﬂuorescence from
the 00 state.

For both components of the dimer A0

0 transition we ﬁnd
120(10) ns lifetime, which is signiﬁcantly longer than the
40 ns (Ref. 44). This short gas phase
gas phase value of

∼

6

lifetime has been attributed to a mixed state of excited
van der Waals dimer and excimer74 or the rapid conver-
sion from the former to the latter upon excitation.56 We
therefore conclude that excimer formation of the benzene
dimer is suppressed in helium droplets.

10−4 (Ref. 25), the
transition (see Fig. 2) and f = 1.37
peak absorption cross section is about 0.7 ˚A2. A typical
30 µJ UV laser pulse with 2 mm beam diameter thus ex-
cites about 9% of the benzene molecules in its ﬁeld. In
a multipass cell with 98% reﬂectivity, 40 beam crossings
thus excite a number of benzene molecules that is equal
to the number of doped clusters in about 5 mm of the
cluster beam (assuming no saturation eﬀects).

∼

The rate at which benzene molecules are excited is
ηS/(hν), where S is the lock-in signal (converted from
Volts to Watts through the bolometer sensitivity 2.0
×
105 V/W), hν is the photon energy, and η
0.2 is
the ratio of the energy it takes to evaporate a helium
7 kBK)75 to the energy that this
atom from a droplet (
process removes from the beam ﬂux (the kinetic energy
5
2 kBTnozzle = 35 kBK). Complete accommodation of the
cluster beam on the bolometer is assumed, which may
not be accurate for our “warm” bolometer operating at
4–5 K. At a wavelength of 259 nm, a typical peak lock-in
106 ex-
signal level of 5 pW thus corresponds to
∼
103 per
cited benzene molecules per second, or
∼
103
laser pulse. This suggests that there are
benzene-doped helium droplets in 5 mm of cluster beam
(see above); since the beam moves at
380 m/s, the total
ﬂux of benzene-doped helium clusters is estimated to be
108 s−1, or about 5% of the total number of clus-
∼
ters (see Section II), compared to 1/e (37%) predicted for
optimal single pickup. This mismatch could be due to ei-
ther an inaccurate knowledge of the mean cluster size, or
the inaccuracy of the assumption of 50% clusterization
of the helium beam.

Under the above assumptions, the ﬁrst crossing of
the laser with the cluster beam excites
90 benzene
molecules per shot. On the other hand, for the ﬂuo-
rescence signal in Fig. 2 we estimate the production of
about 0.5 primary electrons in the PMT per laser shot.
For this spectrum, we used a 50 ns gate delayed by about
20 ns from the UV laser pulse; this delay was necessary
to avoid light scattered by the droplet beam, which was
about twice as intense as the ﬂuorescence signal. With
a ﬂuorescence lifetime of
115 ns (see Section IV), we
∼
thus captured about 30% of the total ﬂuorescence signal.
Compounding this with the 20% quantum eﬃciency of
the PMT and 50% collection eﬃciency, we estimate
20
ﬂuorescence events per laser shot.

∼

These signal estimates yield on the order of

four

7

less ﬂuorescence events

to ﬁve times
than relax-
ation/evaporation events per crossing of droplet and laser
beams, suggesting a ﬂuorescence quantum yield of 20%,
very close to the experimental ﬂuorescence yield of 20%
in the gas phase.28 This demonstrates that comparison of
photon emission and beam depletion signals can be used
to estimate absolute quantum yields of emission.

For the benzene dimer, the peak beam depletion signal
is about half the peak monomer signal (see Figure 5),
while the ﬂuorescence signals of monomers and dimers
were found to be of similar amplitude. This indicates a
larger ﬂuorescence quantum yield for (C6H6)2 than for
C6H6 in helium droplets

to excimer formation upon electronic excitation. In the
light of our observation of sharply increased moments
of inertia of benzene in helium (Section III A), it is likely
that the transformation from the T-shaped van der Waals
dimer to the excimer, which is believed to have a parallel
stacked conﬁguration,56,76 is inhibited by the presence of
helium. The ﬂuorescence lifetime we observe would then
be the lifetime of the pure van der Waals dimer, expected
to be similar or slightly shorter (because of an increased
internal conversion rate due to the weak van der Waals
bond) than that of the monomer. We would in fact ex-
pect it to be similar to the lifetime of the trimer (81 ns,
Ref. 56; 79 ns, Ref. 77), which does not form an excimer.

erties, and Carlos Pacheco for the NMR spectra. This

Helium nanodroplet isolation electronic spectroscopy
of aromatic molecules has been extended to benzene and
its dimer. Figure 7 shows a typical broad scan of several
types of dopants in helium droplets. While the cluster
beam depletion spectra are very similar to gas phase spec-
tra, they are blueshifted by about 30 cm−1, conﬁrming an
apparent trend13 of larger blueshifts for larger excitation
energies in aromatic molecules (see Table II). The sol-
vation blueshift in benzene is mostly electronic, judging
from the ν1 vibration which was found to be blueshifted
by only 0.72 cm−1 in helium droplets.

The coupling of the electronic excitation in benzene to
the surrounding helium droplet does not lead to any ob-
servable signature, and we estimate that at least 80% of
the electronic absorption intensity is in the zero-phonon
line.

Not surprisingly, the eﬀective rotational moments of
inertia of C6H6 were found to be greatly increased due
to the surrounding helium. While rotational transitions
could not be resolved, a contour ﬁt estimates that the
moments of inertia are larger by a factor of at least 6.

The splitting patterns of the A0

0 transition in (C6H6)2
and (C6D6)2 are modestly compressed with respect to
the gas phase, but not qualitatively altered; as their most
plausible source we ﬁnd the excitation of librational inter-
molecular motion, although the details remain unknown.
Though the spectra of (C6H6)2 and (C6D6)2 are substan-
tially diﬀerent, the A0
0 spectrum of (s-C6H3D3)2 appears
to be intermediate between the two, indicating that the
dimer splitting diﬀerences are related only to the isotopic
masses and not to their nuclear spin weights.

The ﬂuorescence quantum yield of C6H6 in helium
nanodroplets agrees with the gas phase value. The ﬂu-
orescence lifetime of (C6H6)2, however, is identical to
that of C6H6 in helium droplets, in stark contrast to the
much reduced lifetime of (C6H6)2 in the gas phase. Fur-
ther, the ﬂuorescence quantum yield of the dimer was not
lower than that of the monomer, contrary to gas phase
studies28,56 that found these to diﬀer by about an order
of magnitude. Both the short lifetime and low ﬂuores-
cence yield of the gas phase dimer have been attributed

TABLE II: Solvation shifts of the electronic spectra (lowest
allowed transition) of polyacenes in helium droplets. #ZPL
refers to the number of “zero-phonon” lines observed in he-
lium nanodroplets. The shift for anthracene was determined
with only 12 helium atoms, and is expected to be diﬀerent in
helium droplets.

larizabilities in the ground (S0) and ﬁrst excited (S1) states
of C6H6, adapted from the CCSD calculations of Ref. 82
(Sadlej+6 basis set). Experimentally, the quadrupole moment
in the ground state is −2.1(1) e˚A2 (Ref. 83) or −1.8(1) e˚A2
(Ref. 84).

overview beam depletion spectrum of
(C6H6)2, C6H6–Ar, and C6H6. For this spec-
trum, a ﬁrst pickup cell was ﬁlled with C6H6 to a
pressure that resulted in equal amounts of single
and double pickups, and a second cell was opti-
mized for pickup of a single argon atom (about
10−4 mbar). No further complexes with argon
8
were detected.

FIG. 3: Panel A: comparison of the C6H6 A0

0 (solid) and
A0
1 (dashed) lines of C6H6 in helium droplets.
Wavenumbers are relative to the gas phase tran-
sitions (see Table I). No phonon wing is seen
within 15 cm−1 of the A0
0 transition. The dot-
ted line is a ﬂuorescence excitation spectrum of
the A0
0 transition, with the intensity (right-hand
scale) referring to the estimated number of pri-
mary electrons in the photomultiplier tube per
laser shot.

trum at 0.38 K (dashed line, from Ref. 6; con-
voluted with a 0.2 cm−1 FWHM Gaussian and
shifted by +30.31 cm−1; stick spectrum in panel
B). The low-temperature populations are mostly
due to the conservation of nuclear spin, as the
comparison to a spin-relaxed spectrum (dotted
line; stick spectrum in panel C) shows. At zero
temperature, only states with J = K
3 are
populated.

0 beam deple-
tion spectrum (solid lines) at 0.38 K, using the
rotational Hamiltonian of Ref. 6. The rotational
constants B′′ and B′ are scaled by a numeri-
cal factor κB; C′′ and C′ (including C′
0ζ′) are
scaled by κC . The ﬁtting procedure optimizes
κB, κC , the width of the smoothing function
(Gaussian), oﬀset, amplitude, and blueshift. In
the upper panel, room-temperature nuclear spin
weights were assumed; in the lower panel, the
nuclear spin weights were relaxed to their values
at 0.38 K. Both ﬁts are equally good, yielding no
information on the importance of nuclear spin
relaxation. The stick spectra are magniﬁed 10
times; they were convoluted with Gaussians of
0.4 cm−1 FWHM to produce the spectral ﬁts.

of (C6H5D)2, relative to the average of the two
lines). Solid lines are A0

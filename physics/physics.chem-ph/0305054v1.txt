Self Consistent Molecular Field Theory for Packing in Classical Liquids

Lawrence R. Pratt and Henry S. Ashbaugh

(Dated: December 8, 2013)

Building on a quasi-chemical formulation of solution theory, this paper proposes a self consistent
molecular ﬁeld theory for packing problems in classical liquids, and tests the theoretical predictions
for the excess chemical potential of the hard sphere ﬂuid. Results are given for the self consistent
molecular ﬁelds obtained, and for the probabilities of occupancy of a molecular observation volume.
For this system, the excess chemical potential predicted is as accurate as the most accurate prior
theories, particularly the scaled particle (Percus-Yevick compressibility) theory. It is argued that the
present approach is particularly simple, and should provide a basis for a molecular-scale description
of more complex solutions.

I.

INTRODUCTION

theory is built upon the relations [25, 26]

The disordered packing of molecules at liquid densities
is a primary and diﬃcult problem in the theory of liquids
[1, 2]. This problem is typically addressed ﬁrst by consid-
eration of model intermolecular interactions of hard-core
type, interactions that rigidly exclude molecular overlap.
For those systems, a quantity of primary interest is then
Boltzmann’s available phase space [3] from which follows
the thermodynamic excess chemical potential discussed
here. Sophisticated theories, even if esoteric, are avail-
able [4, 5, 6, 7] for the equation of state of the hard sphere
ﬂuid.
In conjunction with simulation results, adapta-
tions of those theories provide empirically exact results
for the hard sphere system [8]. Recent theoretical ac-
tivity [9, 10] on the hard sphere ﬂuid emphasizes that
physical clarity is an important quality of theories that
might be transplanted to describe more realistic solution
models. The physical content of available models of pack-
ing of more realistically shaped molecules is conceptually
similar to theories of the hard sphere ﬂuid, but the re-
sultant theories are naturally more complicated than for
hard spheres; Refs. [9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19,
20, 21, 22, 23, 24] give examples of that ongoing activity.

Recent developments of a quasi-chemical approach to
the theory of molecular solutions [25] have brought a new
set of concepts to bear on these problems [26]; these de-
velopments suggest theories with clear physical content
and a clear path for progressive improvement. This paper
pursues these developments further, proposing and test-
ing a self consistent molecular ﬁeld theory for molecular
scale packing. More important than the speciﬁc packing
problem considered here, these self consistent molecu-
lar ﬁeld ideas will be carried forward to develop quasi-
chemical treatments of realistic solutions [25].

II. THEORY

For economy of the presentation, we speciﬁcally discuss
the one component hard sphere ﬂuid. The quasi-chemical

pn(R) =

Kn(R)ρn

Km(R)ρm

(1)

where pn(R) are probabilities for observing n sphere cen-
ters in an observation sphere of radius R in the liquid, and
the Kn(R) are well deﬁned equilibrium ratios of concen-
trations of hard sphere n-complexes with that observa-
tion sphere with K0 ≡ 1. The quantities Kn(R) describe
occupancy transformations fully involving the solution
neighborhood of the observation volume. Except in the
limit of low density, these coeﬃcients are known only
approximately. Therefore, physically motivated approx-
imations are required to proceed to speciﬁc quantitative
predictions.

Our previous study of this problem [26] identiﬁed a

primitive quasi-chemical approximation in which

Here v = 4πR3/3 is the volume of the observation sphere,
β−1 = kT , u(rij) is the interaction between molecules i
and j (the hard sphere interaction in the present case),
and ζ is a Lagrange multiplier used to achieve consistency
between the known bulk density, ρ , and the average den-
sity in the observation volume. Because of the explicit
factors of ρ in Eq. 1, ζ will approach the thermodynamic
excess activity, ln ζ = βµex with µex the excess chemical
potential of Gibbs. The integrals of Eq. 2 are few-body
integrals that can be estimated by Monte Carlo meth-
ods [26]. A natural extension of this idea is to approx-
imate Kn(R) on the basis of n-molecule conﬁgurational
integrals that give the low-density limiting quantity, but
with inclusion of a molecular ﬁeld βϕSCF (r) as

Kn(R) ≈

We will adopt the convention that the molecular ﬁeld
βϕSCF (r) be zero at the center of the observation vol-
ume, and an additive constant be absorbed in the La-
grange multipliers of the K (0)
n (R; βϕSCF ). The molecular
ﬁeld βϕSCF (r), together with the Lagrange multiplier,
may be made consistent with the information that the
prescribed density of the liquid is uniform within the ob-
servation volume. The density proﬁle for the n-molecule
case is [27]

Examples of the results following from these ideas are
shown in Figs. 1-5. These results were obtained from
a two step iterative procedure from a starting guess
βϕSCF (r) = 0 and the probabilities pn of the primitive
quasi-chemical theory [26]. With the current approxi-
mate results, we performed Monte Carlo calculations to
estimate the densities for each occupancy, and on that
basis the average density implied by the current ﬁeld.
We then updated the molecular ﬁeld according to

[βϕ(r)SCF ]new = [βϕ(r)SCF ]old + f ln

ρ(r)

(cid:20)

ρ (cid:21)

,

(6)

where f is a constant less than one that ensures stable
convergence of the molecular ﬁeld; a value of 0.2 was
found to work here. Convergence is obtained in 20 itera-
tions of this procedure, typically. Using the ﬁeld obtained
above, we then updated the occupancies, reevaluating the
K (0)
n (R; βϕSCF ) by performing additional few-body sim-
ulations to evaluate the work associated with turning on
the molecular ﬁeld using thermodynamic integration

where λ is a coupling parameter, and h. . .iλ indicates av-
eraging over conﬁgurations generated under the inﬂuence
of the molecular ﬁeld scaled as λβϕSCF (r). Using these
recalculated K (0)
n (R; βϕSCF ), we generated a new set of
pn, tested for convergence, and so on. This process was
found to converge within two steps even at the highest
densities considered. We attribute the observed conver-
gence to the fact that the starting point, the primitive
quasi-chemical theory, is accurate for the probable occu-
pancies. The molecular ﬁelds obtained using this method
were found to converge stably with little diﬃculty.

Fig. 1 shows the self consistent molecular ﬁelds ob-
tained using the procedure described above up to ﬂuid
densities of ρd3 = 0.9, just below the hard sphere freez-
ing transition. βϕSCF (r) is a monotonically increasing
function of radial position from the center of the stencil
volume to its boundary. This reﬂects the fact that in
the absence of the molecular ﬁeld the hard sphere parti-
cles tend to build up on the surface of the stencil volume
to minimize their interactions with the other particles
(Fig. 2). The molecular ﬁeld makes the boundary repul-
sive, depletes the surface density, and homogenizes the
density within the volume. The magnitude of this repul-
sive ﬁeld increases with increasing ﬂuid density.

The predicted hard sphere chemical potentials as a
function of density using the primitive and self consis-
tent molecular ﬁeld quasi-chemical theories are compared
to the chemical potential from the Carnahan-Starling
equation in Fig. 3. The primitive theory works well
up to ρd3 ≈ 0.35, roughly the critical density for Ar
and the density region suggested to mark qualitative
packing changes in the hard sphere ﬂuid [28]; at higher

3

densities the primitive quasi-chemical theory systemati-
cally under-predicts the hard sphere chemical potential.
The present self consistent molecular ﬁeld theory sig-
niﬁcantly improves the agreement with the Carnahan-
Starling equation over the entire density range. Above
densities of ρd3 ≈ 0.6, the self consistent molecular ﬁeld
theory begins to over-predict the hard sphere chemi-
cal potential, though the absolute value of the error is
in marked improvement over the primitive theory. We
note that the self consistent molecular ﬁeld theory is
in closer agreement with the scaled particle (or Percus-
Yevick compressibility) theory for the chemical poten-
tial. Fig. 4 shows that the most important deﬁciencies of

primitive quasi-chemical theory of Ref. [26], and the solid lines
correspond to the present SCF theory. Note the marked break-
away of the n=0 point from the primitive quasi-chemical
curve, observed before [26]. The errors on the high n side
of these distributions might reﬂect the fact that the present
SCF theory doesn’t explicitly treat pair correlations. Those
correlations enter only through the integrals K (0)
n (R; βϕSCF ).

the primitive quasi-chemical theory are corrected by the
self-consistent molecular ﬁeld theory. Note that the self-
consistent molecular ﬁeld theory captures the break-away
at high density of ln p0 from the primitive quasi-chemical
prediction.

In addition to achieving a uniform density across the
observation volume, the self consistent molecular ﬁeld
also nearly achieves thermodynamic consistency for the
chemical potential. With the choice of an additive con-
stant which makes βϕSCF (r) zero in the deepest inte-
rior of the observation volume, ln ζ should approach the
excess activity of the solvent in the limit of a large ob-
servation volume. We expect on a physical basis that
βϕSCF (r) describes an interaction between the interior
and the exterior of the observation volume across the
intervening surface. Particularly in the present case of
short ranged interactions, we expect spatial variation of
βϕSCF (r) to be conﬁned to a surface region. Though
a stencil volume of radius R = d is evidently not large

enough to observe that bulk behavior (Fig. 1), for that
R = d case we can compare the computed excess chem-
ical potential with the solvent activity. Fig. 5 compares
-ln p0 and ln ζ as determined by the primitive and self
consistent molecular ﬁeld quasi-chemical theories. While
the activity evaluated within the primitive theory signif-
icantly under-predicts p0, with the self consistent molec-
ular ﬁeld theory ln ζ and -ln p0 agree nearly perfectly. At
the highest densities, there is a slight disparity between
these two quantities, and the calculated values for ln ζ
are in better agreement with the empirically known βµex
for the hard sphere ﬂuid.

III. VARIATION WITH CAVITY SIZE

The related quantity

4πρR2G(R) = −

d ln p0
dR

(8)

is of special interest in the theory of the hard sphere ﬂuid,
and of solubility more generally [7, 29, 30]. In the present
quasi-chemical approximation, this is

4πρR2G(R) ≈

m pm (d ln Km(R; βϕSCF )/dR) . (9)

P

To analyze the required derivative, we consider that the
radius R is deﬁned in the ﬁrst place by a bare ﬁeld βϕ0
that is zero (0) inside the observation volume and ∞ out-
side. Then the full ﬁeld encountered with the integrals
Eq. 3 is βϕ = βϕ0 + βϕSCF . The result now correspond-
ing to Eq. 4 is

Upon separating the contribution from βϕ0 and perform-

relation

With this ﬁrst population averaging, we emphasize that
βϕSCF (r) doesn’t depend on the occupancy index m.
The radius derivative ∂βϕ(r)/∂R of the full ﬁeld can be
described by a simple formal relation. The relation

= − hδρm(r)δρm(r′)i

(12)

follows from Eq. 4 for each occupancy. Performing the
population averaging at this stage, we write

= hδρ(r)δρ(r′)i ≡ χ(r, r′)

− δβϕ(r) =

Z

Averaging of the functional derivative Eq. 12 before com-
posing Eq. 14 is suggestive of the RPA concept of exploit-
ing an average potential in a linear response function.
To use Eq. 14, consider the density change δρ(r′) corre-
sponding to dematerialization of the uniform density in
a thin shell (R − ∆R, R).

where the latter integral is over solid angles covering

Ornstein-Zernike direct correlation function deﬁned by
χ−1(r, r′) = δ(r − r′)/ρ(r) − c(r, r′). We ﬁnally obtain

G(R) = 1 −

c(r, r′ = ˆzR)ρd3r

(16)

Zv

within the present approximation. In the indicated inte-
gral the r′ coordinate is pinned to the sphere surface, and
r integration is over the interior of the sphere because of
Eq. 10. The function c(r, r′) is the OZ direct correla-
tion function in the ﬁeld βϕ including the self consistent
molecular ﬁeld, thus for the case of a uniform density
enclosed in a sphere of radius R with no materal outside.
It is obvious that Eq. 16 gives the corrrect answer for
the case that the solvent atoms have no interaction with
one another (c(r, r′)= 0), and for the same reason this
formula is obviously correct in the limit of zero density.
That limiting result gives the second virial coeﬃcient the-
ory for ln p0. At the initial order in the density

c(r, r′) = exp[−βu(r, r′)] − 1 + O(ρ).

(17)

This relation in the approximate Eq. 16 leads to the cor-
rect contribution of next order in the density for G(R),
corresponding the third virial contribution to ln p0.

(10)

1 − 4πρR3/3

Exact results are also available in the case that the
observation sphere is suﬃciently small, R ≤ d
2 . Then
p0 = 1-4πρR3/3, βϕSCF (r)=ln
(spatially
uniform in 0 ≤ r ≤ R, so in the formulation above this
would be reﬂected solely in the Lagrange multipliers).
Direct calculation gives χ(r, r′) = ρδ(r − r′) − ρ2, and
χ−1(r, r′) = ρ−1δ(r, r′) +
1−4πρR3/3 . Using these re-
1
sults in Eq. 16 gives the known answer, G(R)=
1−4πρR3/3 .
Tests of other current theories in this regime have been
given by [10].

IV. CONCLUDING DISCUSSION

The physical content of the present self consistent
molecular ﬁeld theory is simple and clear, and this theory
is as accurate as the most accurate prior theories, partic-
ularly the scaled particle (Percus-Yevick compressibility)
theory, for the thermodynamics of the hard sphere ﬂuid.
The conclusion is that careful attention to the near neigh-
borhood of a distinguished solute in such a liquid, with
a self consistent molecular ﬁeld describing the inﬂuence
of the more distant neighborhood, provides an accurate
description of packing in dense liquids. Though distinct,
the hydrostatic linear response theory [10] leads to a simi-
lar conclusion that good theories of these phenomena can
be extremely local. The present results address contribu-
tions essential to quasi-chemical descriptions of solvation
in more realistic cases, as has been discussed on a con-
ceptual basis recently [25].

The present results provide a deﬁnite, and organized

5

basis for theoretical study of subsequent solvation phe-
nomena. For example, consider inclusion of attractive
interactions between solvent molecule spheres, interac-
tions secondary to the repulsive interactions. The sim-
ple estimate c(r) ∼ −βu(r) for distances not too small,
is consistent with Eq. 17. But when u(r) at those dis-
tances describes attractive interactions, Eq. 16 then pre-
dicts that these attractive interactions reduce the mag-
nitude of G(R). This is a behavior that has been much
discussed over recent years in the context of theories of
inert gas solubility in liquid water [25, 26, 30, 31].

A related but distinct issue is how these packing ques-
tions are aﬀected by multiphasic behavior of the solu-
tion, particularly the possibility of drying [32, 33, 34] or
preferential absorption [35] in biophysical aqueous appli-
cations. In such cases, it is attractive to speculate that
the self consistent molecular ﬁeld βϕSCF should reﬂect
those multiphase possibilities just as it can in pedagogical
treatments of non-molecular models of phase transitions
[36].

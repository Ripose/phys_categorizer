Abstract

We study the quantization of three-dimensional many-body systems in rotating coordinate
frames deﬁned implicitly by frame conditions. We carry out the elimination of orientational
degrees of freedom in general, giving the Hamiltonian for the N -particle system in a broad class
of body frames in terms of frame conditions and internal coordinates. We obtain several forms
for the kinetic energy operator and compare them to related expressions in the literature.

Introduction

The problem of separating the dynamics of quantum many-body systems into collective rotations
and internal motions leads to their quantization in rotating frames. We refer to a rotating frame as
a body frame when the components of the total angular momentum operator in a space-ﬁxed frame
and in the rotating frame satisfy the same commutator algebra as in the rigid body problem. In the
latter case the body frame is essentially unique, up to time-independent rotations and symmetry
transformations of the rigid body. For a general N -particle system there is a large freedom to
choose a body frame. It is thus of interest to study the quantization of many body systems in a
class of body frames as wide as possible.

In this paper we study the quantization of three-dimensional many-body systems in rotating
coordinate frames deﬁned in implicit form by frame, or gauge, conditions. We carry out the
elimination of orientational degrees of freedom in general, giving the Hamiltonian for the N -particle
system in a broad class of body frames in terms of frame conditions and internal coordinates. We
obtain several forms for the kinetic energy operator and compare them to related expressions in the
literature, showing how the coeﬃcient functions are ﬁxed by the frame convention, through frame
conditions, and internal coordinates. In the case of linear frames and body-frame coordinates our
results reduce to those previously obtained in [1].

The generic Hamiltonians discussed here can be applied to speciﬁc physical systems by choosing
internal coordinates appropriate to the system under consideration. Those physical problems
include, for instance, the determination of molecular rotation-vibration energy levels and their
wave functions [2], and scattering problems in molecular, atomic and nuclear physics. There is a
vast body of literature on the quantization of many-body systems which we do not try to summarize
here. Broad reviews relevant to the point of view adopted in this paper are given in [3, 4].

The outline of the paper is the following.

In the next section we discuss several technical
issues related to body frames and the frame conditions deﬁning them that are needed in order
to obtain the Hamiltonian and quantum inner product for a many body system. Those include
the form of admissible frame conditions and their reparameterizations, the body-frame angular
momentum, and internal coordinates. In section 3 we derive the body-frame kinetic energy operator
in standard order in terms of internal coordinates and frame conditions. The form of wave functions
referred to the body frame and their inner product is discussed in section 4, where we also give the
representations of the total angular momentum and kinetic energy operators both as irreducible
matrices and in rigid rotator form. In section 5 we give two alternate forms for the Hamiltonian
and discuss their equivalence with the standard ordered form given in section 3. Also, we make
contact with the gauge-ﬁeld formalism of [3] by locally expressing gauge ﬁelds in terms of frame
conditions. Examples with N = 3 and 4 are brieﬂy examined in sections 6 and 7 as veriﬁcations
of the formalism of the previous sections, and the results compared with those from the molecular
literature. In section 8 we give some ﬁnal remarks.

2 Preliminaries

We consider rotating frames whose deﬁnition depends only on the coordinates of the particles and
not on their velocities, nor on the angular velocity of the frame itself. Those frames can always be
deﬁned implicitly by imposing conditions on the position vectors of the particles. Most of the body
frames commonly used in the literature belong to this class, as illustrated in sections 6 and 7 below
with two familiar examples. Another well-known example is the Eckart frame [5, 6]. We do not
impose any restriction on the form of frame conditions, provided they ﬁx the frame uniquely. The
particular case of frame conditions depending linearly on the particles coordinates was considered
in [1] from the point of view of gauge invariance.

2.1 Frame conditions and their reparameterizations

The frame conditions deﬁning the body frame must ﬁx its six degrees of freedom. The translational
degrees of freedom are ﬁxed by choosing the center of mass frame. Thus, the frame conditions take
the form,1

The letters a, b, c, d are used for non-tensorial indices, as in Ga. Summation over those indices and their ranges
of variation are always explicitly indicated. We only use the summation convention for tensor indices, denoted by
latin letters i, j, k, l, . . ., which always run from 1 to 3. Greek indices number particles.

A conﬁguration of the system is actually {r, ˙r}. We refer to {r} as a conﬁguration here for convenience.

In order for the conditions

in form than gradients of Euler angles. The Jacobian J as given in (24), which is proportional to

in this case is closely analogous to the case of linear frame conditions discussed in [1]. We will not

5 Other forms for the Hamiltonian

Other forms for the many-body Hamiltonian in a body-ﬁxed frame, based on expression (24) for
the Laplacian, have been given in the literature (see, e.g., [3, 9] and references therein). In this
section we discuss the derivation of the kinetic energy operator in the form (24) from the point of
view of frame conditions and establish relations among these results and those of section 3. Our
notation follows that of [3].

In order to express the kinetic energy in the form (24) it is convenient to write the matrix k−1
ab

in a form diﬀerent from that used in sec. 3. Deﬁning,

are dynamically trivial. With these expressions for k−1
ab we can compute its determinant 1/J 2, by
factoring the matrix appropriately. We again omit the details [1, 3] and state the result

considered in detail in the case of linear frame conditions in [1], and the same procedure can be
applied to the case of general frame conditions discussed in this paper. The expression for the
quantum potential, however, seems to us to be too complicated to be useful in practice so we
omit the results. Other orderings are of course possible, although with similar caveats about the
associated quantum potentials. That is an advantage, from our point of view, of the standard
ordering given in section 3.

around the

also remains the same as above.

7 The case N =4

As a further example we consider in this section a four-particle system. Our choices of frame
and internal coordinates below are appropriate for a system with the topology of the formalde-
hyde molecule, though the results are also applicable to other systems for which those choices are
not singular at the equilibrium conﬁguration. The vibrational Hamiltonian for the formaldehyde
molecule has been given, in the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, e.g., in [2] (see section 4.3 and
appendix A.) Other explicit results for four-body systems are given in [4] and references therein.
Here we use a set of internal coordinates which, combined with the general results given above,
greatly simplify calculations and lead to moderately simple results for the total Hamiltonian, in-
cluding rotation and vibration-rotation terms. One drawback of our coordinate choice, however, is
that it also results in a complicated expression for the inner product. This section is not meant as
an exhaustive kinematic analysis of the four-body problem, but rather as an example of the results
given above.

In this section we label the particles with capital letters, α = A, . . . , D.

In the case of the
formaldehyde molecule D would refer to the carbon atom, A to the oxygen, and B and C to the
hydrogen atoms. We choose a frame with origin at the center of mass whose Z axis lies along
RAD ≡
RD, and the Y axis is deﬁned by the condition that RCD lies on the Y Z coordinate
RA −
plane. This choice of frame is singular when RCD is parallel to RAD. The rotational frame
conditions are,

G1 ≡

rADx = 0 ,

rADy = 0 ,

rCDx = 0 .

G2 ≡

G3 ≡

The frame is completely determined by (67) together with the auxiliary conditions RADZ > 0 and
RCDY > 0 deﬁning the direction of the axes. From (67) and (2) we get,

This singularity, together with the somewhat involved integration limits resulting from (71), make

the expression for the inner product computationally cumbersome. For systems whose equilibrium
conﬁguration is far from the singularity, however, the contribution from that region should be
strongly suppressed by the wave functions in (39).

8 Final remarks

In this paper we derived the body-frame Hamiltonian for a system of N particles in terms of
frame conditions and internal coordinates. Obtaining the Hamiltonian in terms of frame conditions
instead of Euler angles and the inertia tensor and their derivatives leads arguably to computational
simpliﬁcations. All frames used in applications are deﬁned by polynomial conditions, usually of
in the kinetic energy operator (33), given
and
ﬁrst or second degree. The coeﬃcients
by algebraic expressions in terms of ﬁrst derivatives of those frame conditions, can be eﬃciently
evaluated with symbolic computer algorithms or, depending on N and the internal coordinates
ta being used, even by hand.
In particular, there is no need to invert the inertia tensor, or to
compute its determinant or that of the vibrational kinetic tensor gab (25). Similarly, neither those
determinants nor derivatives of Euler angles are required for the computation of the volume element
in the quantum inner product as given by (35) and (36), and the derivatives of internal coordinates
involved in (36) are evaluated only at the frame manifold. Those simpliﬁcations should be more

illustrated in the examples of section 6.

Ga, as
The Hamiltonian is given in standard order in (33) and in the alternate forms (54) and (55).
Comparing those three forms leads to some useful relations among their coeﬃcients, in particular
the expression (58) for the gauge ﬁeld Aa in terms of frame conditions. One advantage of the
standard-order form (33) is that it is known to be equivalent to a path-integral formulation in
phase space with post-point discretization, whereas for the undeﬁned orderings of (54) and (55)
the path-integral equivalents are in principle not known and have to be constructed. In section
4, in connection with the quantum inner product in the body-frame, we discuss two equivalent
representations for the angular momentum operators and the kinetic energy. Namely, as irre-
ducible matrices acting on ℓ-component wave functions, (43), and as diﬀerential operators acting
on rigid-rotator wave functions, (46). The rigid-rotator representation, which can be a convenient
alternative to the matricial one for some computations, appears naturally in the gauge-invariant
approach of [1].

In section 2 we discuss frame conditions from the point of view of their admissibility and
reparametrizations. Not discussed in this paper is the problem of frame singularities. From (3) we

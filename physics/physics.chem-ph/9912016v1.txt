Abstract

It is known that the presence of cations like Ca++ or Pb++ in the water
subphase alters the pressure-area isotherms for fatty acid monolayers. The
corresponding lattice constant changes have been studied using x-ray diﬀrac-
tion. Reﬂection-absorption spectroscopy has been used to probe the chemical
composition of the ﬁlm. We report on the ﬁrst measurements of the time
evolution of the shear viscosity of arachidic acid monolayers in the presence
of Ca++ ions in the subphase. We ﬁnd that the introduction of Ca++ ions
to the water subphase results in an increase of the ﬁlm’s viscosity by at least
three orders of magnitude. This increase occurs in three distinct stages. First,
there is a rapid change in the viscosity of up to one order of magnitude. This
is followed by two periods, with very diﬀerent time constants, of a relatively
slow increase in the viscosity over the next 10 or more hours. The correspond-
ing time constants for this rise decrease as either the subphase pH or Ca++
concentration is increased.

I. INTRODUCTION

Over the last ten years there has been a renewed interest in the study of Langmuir
monolayers [1], due to the development and application of a number of powerful tools like
x-ray diﬀraction [2,3], Brewster Angle microscopy (BAM) [4,5], and ﬂuorescence microscopy
[6–8]. Langmuir monolayers are monomolecular ﬁlms at the air-water interface formed by
amphiphilic molecules. Typically, these molecules have a long hydrophobic chain oriented
away from the water surface and a polar, hydrophilic headgroup that interacts with the
components of the aqueous subphase. Langmuir monolayers serve as an excellent model
for biological membranes and for surfactant stabilizers that are added to foams. Also, they
are the starting point for Langmuir-Blodgett depositions where a solid substrate is passed
through the Langmuir monolayers, transferring one or more layers of the molecules. For all
three of these applications, understanding the interaction between Langmuir monolayers and
ions in the subphase is important for two reasons. First, the ions are often naturally present
in these systems, either as biologically relevant chemicals or as contaminants. Second, the
ions provide a mechanism for controlling the mechanical properties of the ﬁlms, which is
especially important in applications related to foams and Langmuir-Blodgett depositions.

A number of techniques, including pressure-area isotherms [9–11], reﬂection-absorption
spectrometry [12], and x-ray diﬀraction [13], have been used to study the eﬀects of divalent
cations on the monolayer structure. These studies have highlighted the important role played
by pH, especially for fatty acid monolayers, in modifying the eﬀects of divalent cations on the
structure of the monolayer. The equilibrium phase behavior of fatty acids on a pure water,
or low pH subphase, have been extensively studied [14]. There is a generally applicable phase
diagram that consists of both “tilted” and “untilted” phases. A tilted phase is one in which
the monolayer tails are tilted with respect to the surface normal. Generally, the untilted
phases occur at higher pressures. One of the main eﬀects of the calcium ions, as the pH is
increased, is to lower the transition pressure between the various phases [13]. Ultimately,
at very high pH, the tilted phases no longer appear to exist. This lowering of the transition
pressure is often referred to as a “stiﬀening” of the monolayer. A common feature of these
studies is that no long term variations in the monolayer properties were measured. This is
reasonable if chemical equilibrium with the ions in solution is reached relatively rapidly.

Despite the evidence from pressure-area isotherms that the cations cause a stiﬀening of
the monolayer, there has been minimal eﬀorts to measure eﬀects of cations on the viscoelastic
properties of the monolayer [15,16]. In this paper, we report on a series of measurements of
the viscoelastic properties of arachidic acid monolayers in the presence of Ca++. We have
looked at the eﬀect of pH and Ca++ concentration on the time evolution of three properties
of the monolayer: the isotherms; the viscosity (η); and the complex shear modulus G. Our
isotherm results at t = 1 hr are consistent with previous measurements of fatty acids and
divalent cations [13]. However, we have found a slow change in the viscoelastic properties of
the monolayer over a long time period. This behavior suggests interesting kinetics for the
chemical reaction between the arachidic acid and the Ca++.

II. EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS

The viscoelastic properties were measured using a two-dimensional Couette viscometer
that is described in detail elsewhere [17]. A schematic of the apparatus is given in Fig. 1. A
circular barrier made of twelve individual teﬂon ﬁngers is immersed into water in a circular
trough. A circular knife-edge torsion pendulum (rotor) hangs by a wire so that it just
touches the water surface in the center of the trough. A stationary teﬂon disk is placed
in the water just under the pendulum. The disk has the same diameter as the knife-edge
pendulum. A Langmuir monolayer is made at the annular air-water interface between the
barrier and the rotor knife-edge. The barrier can be compressed or expanded to control
the monolayer pressure and rotated to generate a two dimensional Taylor-Couette ﬂow.
The angular position of the rotor can be measured by means of a pick-up coil attached to
the rotor. This is used to measure the torque generated by ﬂow in the monolayer on the
inner rotor. The torque provides a measurement of the monolayer viscosity. In addition,
an external torque can be applied to the rotor by manipulating an external magnetic ﬁeld.
This allows for both oscillatory measurements of the linear shear response of the monolayer
and measurements of stress relaxation curves for monolayers.

The apparatus is also equipped with a Brewster Angle Microscope (BAM) for observation
of the domain structure of the ﬁlm. The BAM image measures the relative reﬂectivity of p-
polarized light incident on the monolayer at the Brewster angle for pure water. Variations of
reﬂectivity of the monolayer correspond to changes in the orientation of the tilted molecules
from domain to domain.

To study the eﬀect of cations, it is imperative to start with water that has minimal
ionic content. We achieved this by passing de-ionized water through a Millipore ﬁlter to
obtain water with resistivity in excess of 18 MΩ/cm. The concentration of Ca++ was set by
adding CaCl2.2H2O to the puriﬁed water. Most of the experiments used a 0.65 mM Ca++
concentration so that the results would be comparable with Ref. [13].

The arachidic acid monolayer was made from a chloroform solution. The solution was
placed on the aqueous subphase with a microsyringe and allowed to relax for about 20
minutes to facilitate the evaporation of the solvent. Then it was compressed to the pressure
of 9 dyne/cm. All the data presented here were taken at 22 ◦C. At this temperature and
pressure, the monolayer is in the L2 phase. One hour after the solution was placed on the
subphase, the equilibrium angle, θ1, of the rotor was measured. The outer barrier was set
into rotation to generate a Couette ﬂow. The Couette ﬂow causes a torque τ on the rotor
displacing it to a new equilibrium position θ2 such that τ = κ(θ2 − θ1), where κ is the torsion
constant of the wire. After rotating the barrier for about 5 minutes to achieve equilibrium, θ2
was measured, and then the rotation was stopped. This series of experiments was repeated
every hour. The isotherms as well as the complex shear modulus were measured separately.
The barrier rotation rate was 0.0237 rad/sec. With Rinner = 3.81 cm and Rbarrier = 6.5 cm,
this corresponds to a shear rate of 0.057 s−1. G was measured at ω = 0.251 rad/sec.

Figure 2 shows the time evolution of viscosity (measured by the Couette ﬂow method
and henceforth referred to as η) for diﬀerent concentrations of Ca++ in the subphase. All of

the measurements were done at pH 5.5. There are two points of note. One, the higher the
concentration, the higher the rate of viscosity rise. Secondly, the rise in viscosity is in three
parts. There is an initial jump of about one order of magnitude within the ﬁrst hour. The
next two periods are separated by η = 1 g/s, below and above which the viscosity clearly
rises with diﬀerent slopes on the semilog plot. This indicates there are three time constants
associated with the increase. As the ﬁrst data point is taken after one hour of making the
ﬁlm, we cannot comment about the time constant for the viscosity rise in the ﬁrst stage,
except that the upper limit for τ1 is about 0.5 hour. It should be noted that both the time
constants decrease with increasing concentration. For the ﬁlm with 0.65 mM concentration
of Ca++, τ2 = 1.76 hour and τ3 = 5.43 hr, where τ2 and τ3 are the time constants for the
second and the third stage respectively. The time constants for the rest of the data are given
in the ﬁgure caption.

The three diﬀerent stages of viscosity rise are also obvious in Fig. 3 which depicts the
dependence of this rise on the subphase pH. Note that below pH = 4, the viscosity is small
and almost constant. This is consistent with other studies where the isotherms were seen to
remain unchanged for about the same pH. As the pH values are increased, both the initial
jump in viscosity and the later rates of rise increase.

The results of the oscillatory experiment are plotted in the Fig. 4. The complex shear
modulus G (=G′ + iG′′) is known to depend on the strain amplitude for some Langmuir
monolayers [18]. Here G′ is the elastic component of the shear modulus and G′′ is the viscous
component. For a linear viscoelastic ﬂuid, the relation between G′′ and the viscosity, η, is
given by G′′ = ωη, where ω is the oscillation frequency. In this case we found G′′ to be weakly
and G′ to be strongly dependent on the strain amplitude. The dependence was qualitatively
the same as in Ref. [18] i.e., G was constant at small amplitudes and decreased for higher
amplitudes. To ensure linear response, we measured G at a small constant strain amplitude
of about 10−3. As with η, G′′ displays two distinct periods of increase after the ﬁrst hour.
However, G′ rises monotonically with time.

Figure 5 shows the variation of the arachidic acid monolayer isotherm as a function of
time for pH = 5.5. It must be noted that the isotherms were measured separately from the
viscosity. There might be some diﬀerences in the rate of Calcium attachment arising from
the fact that there was no rotation of the monolayer or generation of circular ﬂow in the
subphase. But, the eﬀect is bound to be minimal for two reasons. First, the ﬂow during
viscosity measurements only occurred for roughly 10% of the data run. Second, there was no
turbulence during the ﬂow, so the rate of mixing in the subphase would not be substantially
modiﬁed. Furthermore, the qualitative behavior of G′′ was found to be the same when
measured with the rotation as it was when measured without rotation. This conﬁrmed that
the rotation had minimal eﬀect on the Ca++ binding rate. Figure 5 also shows the position
of the kink in the isotherm that corresponds to the 2nd order phase transition for arachidic
acid monolayer without Ca++ in the subphase (horizontal dashed line). The presence of
Ca++ does alter the isotherm in the ﬁrst hour. There is a lowering of the pressure at which
the 2nd order transition occurs by about 4 dyne/cm. This is consistent with the isotherms
published in the literature [13]. From the X-ray data it is known that this change is due to
the bound calcium changing the head group interactions so that the molecules come closer
together. However, after this initial drop, there is a slow change in the isotherm. This
change corresponds to a decrease in the transition pressure by about 0.3 dyne/cm/hour.

The kink also appears to become more rounded with time. However, we believe that the
apparent rounding is due to the high viscosity of the ﬁlm and is not a real eﬀect.

IV. DISCUSSION

In summary, we ﬁnd that there are many eﬀects of Ca++ ions on the arachidic acid
monolayer. In the ﬁrst hour, the isotherm shifts downwards in pressure by about 4 dyne/cm.
Over the next ten hours, it changes by about 3 dyne/cm. These drops are accompanied by
changes in viscosities, measured by either the rotating barrier method or the oscillating rotor
method. One can interpret the viscosity rising during the ﬁrst hour as a direct result of the
change in the head group interactions. This is consistent with the pH data. It is known that
suﬃciently low pH suppresses the binding of divalent ions to the monolayer [12,13,19,20],
and we observe no viscosity increase at pH 3.4 and below.

The slow rise associated with the late time evolution of the viscosity is surprising. The
3 dyne/cm drop in the transition pressure in this period suggests a very slow rate of Cal-
cium ionically binding to the carboxylate. For octadecanoic acid monolayers, IR reﬂection-
absorption studies [12] have shown that near pH = 6, the Ca++ does not bind to all the
molecules but that some undissociated acid molecules remain in the ﬁlm. The increase in
the viscosity, taken together with the slow change in the isotherm suggest that the same
is true for the arachidic acid and that these remaining acid molecules slowly bind with the
Ca++ ions with a time constant of a few hours. This is supported by the fact that the time
constants τ2 and τ3 both decrease with increasing subphase Ca++ concentration. The steady
rise of G′ seen in Fig. 4 is consistent with this picture; however, the existence of a single
time constant needs to be explained.

The presence of two diﬀerent time constants, namely τ2 and τ3, is also puzzling. If we
accept that Ca++ continues binding to the monolayer, then two broad possibilities emerge:
a. that the rate of the binding changes abruptly and this change is reﬂected in the viscous

response or

b. that the rate of binding does not change but the rate of viscosity rise with respect to

bound site concentration varies after reaching a critical value.

At this point, it is diﬃcult to say which of these pictures is more accurate, but both are
interesting. If the ﬁrst case is correct, it suggests interesting long-term kinetics associated
with the chemical reaction mechanism that undergo abrupt changes. If the latter reason
is correct, it suggests an interesting interplay between the microscopic structure of the
monolayer and the macroscopic viscosity.

One possible mechanism for the abrupt change in the evolution of the viscosity is the
contribution of the line tension between domains in the monolayer to the viscosity.
It is
known from foams and other complex ﬂuids that line tension (or surface tension in three
dimensions) can substantially alter the macroscopic viscosity of a ﬂuid. The L2 phase of
arachidic acid consists of a random domain structure. Friedenberg, et al. [21] report that for
docosanoic acid monolayers in the L2 phase, domains stretched by an extensional ﬂow do
not relax back to their original shape. This indicates that the line tension in the absence of
Ca++ is nearly zero. Similar behavior is observed for our samples of arachidic acid. However,
with Ca++ ions in the subphase, our BAM images show evidence of domain relaxation.
Presumably, line tension between domains will be dominated by Ca++ absorption at the

5

domain boundaries. If this saturates, the rate of change of the viscosity would be altered.
We are currently undertaking detailed studies of this behavior to probe the impact of the
line tension to the overall viscoelastic response of the monolayer and the eﬀect of Ca++ ions
on the line tension.

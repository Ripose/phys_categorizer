Evaporative Cooling of Helium Nanodroplets with Angular Momentum Conservation

Kevin K. Lehmann∗ and Adriaan M. Dokter
Department of Chemistry, Princeton University, Princeton NJ 08544
(Dated: February 2, 2008)

Evaporative cooling of helium nanodroplets is studied with a statistical rate model that includes,
for the ﬁrst time, angular momentum conservation as a constraint on the accessible droplet states.
It is found that while the ﬁnal temperature of the droplets is almost identical to that previously
predicted and later observed, the distribution of total droplet energy and angular momentum states
is vastly more excited than a canonical distribution at the same temperature. It is found that the
ﬁnal angular momentum of the droplets is highly correlated with the initial direction, and that a
signiﬁcant fraction of the alignment of the total angular momentum should be transferred to the
rotational angular momentum of an embedded molecule.

The study of helium nanodroplets has received consid-
erable attention in the past decade.1,2,3 Such droplets
rapidly cool by helium atom evaporation while they
travel inside a vacuum chamber. Brink and Stringari4
used a statistical evaporation model and predicted a ter-
minal temperature of 4He nanodroplets of 0.4 K, in ex-
cellent agreement with the value of 0.38 K later deduced
from the rotational structure in vibrational spectra of
SF6 and other molecules.5,6 Despite the obvious success
of this theoretical work, the model used is clearly incom-
plete in that the constraint of angular momentum conser-
vation was not imposed. The need for a more complete
evaporative cooling study was made evident by the recent
observation of a polarization anisotropy in the absorption
spectrum of pentacene in helium droplets.7 The authors
of this work suggested that the total angular momen-
tum deposited in the droplets by the pickup of a heavy
molecule is aligned perpendicular to the droplet velocity,
and that this droplet alignment survives the evaporative
cooling and is transferred to the embedded molecule. The
present study was undertaken to test the reasonableness
of this conjecture.

We model the evaporative cooling with a statistical
rate approach, analogous to phase space theory in uni-
molecular dissociation, which explicitly includes the con-
straints of angular momentum conservation.8 We use
Monte Carlo sampling to follow cooling ‘trajectories’ as
the droplets lose much of their initial energy and angu-
lar momentum by helium atom evaporation. It is found
that the droplets cool to ﬁnal temperatures close to those
predicted without angular momentum constraints.4 How-
ever, the distribution of terminal droplet states (where
the evaporative cooling lifetime becomes longer than typ-
ical ﬂight times in experiments) cover a vastly broader
range of energy (E) and total angular momentum (J)
than was previously expected. Further, it is found that
the ﬁnal angular momentum vector of the droplet is
highly correlated with the initial value, such that much
of the alignment remains, and that a sizable fraction of
this alignment is transfered to an embedded rotor.

Evaporative Cooling Model — Consider a helium nan-
odroplet, D, with initial values of the conserved quanti-
ties n (number of helium atoms), E′ (total internal en-
ergy in units of Kelvin), and J ′ (the total angular mo-

where Etrans is the center of mass translational energy in
the dissociation and L is the orbital angular momentum
quantum number of the fragments. Conservation of total
angular momentum requires that J ′, J ′′, L obey the tri-
angle rule. Based upon the bulk density of helium,9 the
droplet has radius R(n) = r0n1/3 with r0 = 2.22 ˚A. Con-
servation of energy, including the change in the surface
energy deﬁned by surface tension, σ = 0.272 K˚A−2,10 re-

ρ(n, E′, J ′) is the density of states of the droplet at ﬁxed

atom having kinetic energy above the centrifugal barrier.

For droplets of the size and energy range of interest
to experiments, the density of states is dominated by
quantized capillary waves on the surface of the droplets
( ripplon modes).4 Simple, but highly accurate, analyt-
ical approximations for N (n, E′, J ′) and ρ(n, E′, J ′) =
(∂N/∂E)J ′ have recently been published,11 thus allow-
ing calculation of k(n, E, J). Using an ensemble that
conserves n, E, J, the droplet temperature can be cal-
culated using (kBT (n, E, J))−1 = (∂ ln ρ(n, E, J)/∂E)J .

For droplets with only ripplon excitations, the densities
of states depends upon n only through the size of a re-
duced energy scale which is equal to 3.77n−1/2 K. Start-
ing with a given initial size, energy, and total angular
momentum for the droplet at time zero, we calculate
the evaporation rate and advance time by the inverse
of this number. We then randomly pick a single open
decay channel (E′′, J ′′, L) with probability proportional
1, E′′, J ′′). We can treat the product droplet as
to N (n
a new initial condition, and calculate another evapora-
tion event. As the droplet cools, the rate of evaporation
falls exponentially. When the cumulative time for the
next evaporation event is greater than the assumed free
ﬂight time in an experiment, we terminate the evapora-
tion process.

−

We also did evaporative cooling calculations for
droplets with an embedded linear rotor with eﬀective
rotational constant B, which will typically be several
times smaller than the corresponding value in the gas
phase due to helium motion induced by the rotation.5,6
For these calculations, the integrated density of states,
Nc(n, E, J), for the combined droplet + rotor system
is calculated by convolution of the integrated droplet
density of states with the spectrum of the rigid ro-
Bj(j + 1), J ′)
tor: Nc(n, E, J) = Pj P
These were calculated for various values of B and the
resulting densities ﬁt to the same functional form pre-
viously used for N (n, E, L), but with the ﬁtting con-
stants now expressed as polynomial function of B and
its inverse. Diﬀerentiation gives the combined density of
states, ρc(n, E, J).

Results— We did evaporative cooling calculations with
initial values of n = 104, E = 1700. K, and J =
10, 1000, 2000, . . . 5000, computing 2500 Monte Carlo
‘trajectories’ in each case. These values where selected as
likely initial conditions following the pickup of a tetracene
molecule.7,13 These conditions correspond to an initial
droplet temperature of 2.61 K independent of J. We also

assumed that the initial condition for the total angular
momentum is P (M ) = δ0,M (initial alignment =
1/2).
A cooling time of 100 µs was used.

We can ﬁrst make some qualitative predictions. We
expect that on average the evaporated helium atoms
will reduce droplet energy by Eb + (3/2)kBT where T
is the average temperature during evaporation, which
10 K per He evapo-
would imply an energy loss of
rated. Thus, we would expect
170 helium atoms to
be evaporated. A helium atom evaporated at T will
carry root mean squared (rms) angular momentum of
√2mHekBT R
If the departing atom’s angular
momentum is parallel to the initial angular momentum
(as for water droplets leaving a wet, spinning tennis ball),
we can expect the droplet to lose about 4000¯h while
cooling. Alternatively, if the orbital angular momenta
of the evaporated atoms are random, the droplet angu-
lar momentum would undergo a 3D random walk, and
the mean squared angular momentum of the droplets
would be expected to increase by the number of evap-
orated atoms times the square of the angular momentum
per evaporation event. The form for ρ(n, E, J) for ﬁxed
n, E is that of a thermal distribution of a spherical rotor
with a mean value of J(J + 1) that grows as E8/7.11 For
the initial values of n, E, the rms of the distribution of
ρ(n, E, J) occurs for J = 345, an order of magnitude be-
low the mean value of the angular momentum deposited
in pickup of a large molecule, such as pentacene. It can
be expected that during evaporation, the density of states
will bias evaporation such that the J moves towards the
rms value, which will result in the average angular mo-
mentum being reduced during evaporation. For a canon-
ical distribution at 0.38 K, the mean terminal value of

The ﬁnal temperatures of each trajectory is similar to
that observed experimentally for molecules inside he-
lium droplets5,6 and also to that predicted by evapo-
rative cooling calculations without angular momentum

vious calculations is that the ﬁnal energies and angular
momenta are vastly higher than that found in the previ-
ous work.

We performed evaporative cooling calculations for B =
0.6 and 1.2 GHz. These values were selected as they rep-
resent typical values for “heavy rotors” that have been
studied in helium nanodroplets with rotational resolu-
tion.6 As expected, the presence of the rotor has lit-
tle eﬀect upon the ﬁnal distribution of E and J of the
droplets. Figure 2 shows the calculated ratio of align-
ment of the rotor angular momentum to that of the total
angular momentum for droplets with the average ﬁnal
values of E and J for initial states corresponding to the
Jinitial = 10, 1000, 2000 . . . 5000. It can be seen that the
degree of rotor alignment increases with both j and the
initial angular momentum, though the alignment ratio
appears to saturate at higher Jinitial values. The level
of alignment found in this work is certainly within the
range that should be detectable by experiments of the
type reported for pentacene (

20%).7

Experimental Consequences– This work has demon-
strated that the distribution of the internal excitations
of helium nanodroplets should be vastly more excited
than had been previously predicted, based solely upon
the low temperature of the droplets. The present re-
sults support the interpretation of P¨ortner et al., that a
remnant of the initial pick up angular momentum sur-
vives evaporative cooling and provides a bias that par-
tially aligns embedded molecules.7 The present work pre-
dicts that this should be a common phenomenon. It also
provides a rationalization for the failure of a previous at-
tempt to predict the rovibrational lineshapes of embed-

tum value. Notice that the ‘trapping’ of angular momen-
tum is found even for initial values considerably smaller
than the ‘maximum’ value predicted above that can be
shed by evaporation.
It is also evident from the table
that most of the initial alignment of the total angular
momentum is maintained which indicates that the ﬁnal
angular momentum is nearly parallel to the initial angu-
lar momentum. While for each initial condition, a broad
distribution of ﬁnal E and L values are found, these are
distributed in a narrow band of energy width
8 K, fol-
lowing a line corresponding to constant temperature. For
ﬁxed J, the ﬁnal E values are
45% larger than the low-
est possible droplet energy for that J, which corresponds
to J/2 quanta in the lowest, L = 2 ripplon mode.

While a systematic study of the ﬁnal distributions
upon the full range of likely droplet initial conditions
is beyond the scope of the present report, we would like
to indicate the trends. If the initial energy and total an-
gular momentum quantum number are kept constant at
1700. K and 1000 respectively, and the initial size of the
droplet is decreased from n = 104 to 3
103, the initial
temperature rises from 2.61 to 3.69 K. As expected, the
higher initial temperature rises the average kinetic energy

size, the rms orbital angular momentum carried away by

ﬁnal average angular momentum decreases (401

due to an increased correlation in the emission direction
(average cosine of angle between L and J increases from
0.156 to 0.23). The ﬁnal average energies and tempera-
tures are almost unchanged. If we keep the initial angular
momentum at J = 1000 and the size at n = 104 but de-

ded molecules based upon the inhomogeneous distribu-
tion of molecule “particle in a box” states.14 That work
assumed that these translational states followed a Boltz-
mann distribution, while the present work suggests that
high angular momentum translational states of the em-
bedded molecules will be substantially more populated
in the droplets. More signiﬁcantly, the dramatic eﬀect of
angular momentum constraints calls into question the use
of Path Integral Monte Carlo simulations for nanodroplet
experiments since such calculations assume a canonical
ensemble. The present work demonstrates droplets pre-
pared in existing experiments are poorly described as a
canonical ensemble.

Many of the predictions of the present calculations
could be directly experimentally tested. The trapping
of increasing energy in the droplets with increasing ini-
tial angular momentum will reduce the expected amount
of helium atom evaporation as the collision energy is
changed. However, it is not clear if this could be dis-
entangled from other eﬀects, including a collision and
impact parameter dependence of the pickup probabil-
ity and the possibility of coherent ejection of helium
atoms during the pickup process, i.e. the early evapo-
ration events could be strongly nonstatistical and thus
poorly predicted by the present model. Measurement
of the spatial distribution of helium atoms evaporated

from a droplet would be very revealing, as the present
calculations predict that the atomic velocity distribution
is highly anisotropic in the center of mass frame. Since
the orbital angular momentum of the evaporated atoms
is on average parallel to the initial angular momentum,
which itself is largely perpendicular to the droplet ve-
locity, one expects to ﬁnd the evaporated helium atoms
peaked ahead and behind the droplets in the center of
mass frame. Measurement of the radial distribution of
atoms or molecules embedded in helium nanodroplets
would also reveal the expected increased translational
angular momentum of the dopant.
It is possible that
high energy electron or X-Ray scattering experiments
could reveal the radial distribution function of atoms or
molecules solvated by helium nanodroplets. The most
direct test of the present model would be to measure the
trapped internal energy and/or angular momentum of
the droplets. One way that could be done in principle is
to measure the Stokes and antistokes Raman spectrum
from the lowest, L = 2 ripplon mode. It should be noted
that excitation of the L = 2 mode should dominate in
the trapped states, which have nearly the lowest possible
internal energy for a given total angular momentum.

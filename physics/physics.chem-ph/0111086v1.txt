Conjugated donor-acceptor (DA) chromophores, also
called push-pull chromophores, are molecules constituted
by an electron-donor (D) and an electron-acceptor (A)
group connected by a π-conjugated backbone. These
molecules are widely investigated in several, apparently
they are common solvation probes1,
unrelated ﬁelds:
are molecules of choice for second order non-linear op-
tics (NLO) applications2, and are useful model systems
for electron transfer3. All these applications exploit the
presence of a low-lying excited state, characterized by a
diﬀerent electronic distribution from the ground state.

Reactions involving charge migrations are ubiquitous
in all ﬁelds of chemistry and biochemistry, so that under-
standing their mechanism is of special interest4. These
reactions often occur in solution, and are strongly inﬂu-
enced by the medium itself, suggesting a strong coupling
between solvent and solute. Nowadays, advances in laser
technology allow to study the coupled reactant and sol-
vent dynamics4. In the typical experiment, a (series of)
short pulse(s) of light is used to perturb the electronic
charge distribution of the solute; the system is then in-
terrogated by a retarded probe pulse. Polar conjugated
chromophores, due to their strongly solvent-dependent
properties, are molecules of choice for this kind of exper-
iments, oﬀering as an additional bonus also the oppor-
tunity to investigate the kinetics of electron transfer in
the absence of reactant diﬀusion5. A proper interpreta-
tion of both steady-state and time-resolved experiments
is the key to gain important physical information. How-
ever, standard interpretative schemes are based on linear
perturbative treatments of the solute-solvent interaction,
so that they disregard one of the most characteristic fea-
their large non-
tures of push-pull chromophores, i.e.
linearity. We have already proposed a model that, ac-
counting for the intrinsic non-linearity of the electronic
system, is able to rationalize steady-state electronic and
vibrational spectra of polar chromophores in solution. In
this paper the same model is extended to discuss time-
resolved experiments.

Since the properties of push-pull chromophores are
dominated by the lowest excited state, a two-state model
describes the essential physics governing the low-energy
behavior of these molecules. The electronic structure of
push-pull chromophores can be described as resonating

in the ground-
or excited-state. The expectation value of this operator,

, corresponding to the polarity of the molecule
ˆρ

h
in the relevant state, only depends on the ratio z0/t, so
that the electronic problem is fully described by a single
parameter. We allow for the coupling of the electronic
system with a molecular vibration, Q, and a solvation
coordinate, q, by assigning the two basis states two har-
monic potential energy surfaces (PES), with equal cur-
vature but displaced minima along the two coordinates.
The resulting Hamiltonian, describing these slow degrees
of freedom and their coupling to electrons is7:

where the ﬁrst two terms account for the internal vibra-
tion, and the last two for the solvation coordinate. Ω and
ω are the frequencies corresponding to Q and q, respec-
due
tively; ǫsp and ǫor are the energies gained by
to the relaxation of Q and q, respectively, i.e. the small-
polaron binding energy and the solvent reorganization
energy.

The linear dependence of the energy separation be-
tween the two basis states on Q and q coordinates orig-
inates a non-linear dependence of ρ on the two coordi-
nates, making the exact potential energy, V (Q, q), an-
harmonic. This anharmonicity, originating from the cou-
pling of electrons to slow degrees of freedom, has many
important consequences:
in particular it is responsible
for a large ampliﬁcation of static hyperpolarizabilities8.

III. SPECTROSCOPIC PROPERTIES

Absorption and ﬂuorescence spectra are vertical pro-
cesses, occurring at diﬀerent (Q, q). The dependence of
ρ on slow coordinates (both Q and q) then leads to non-
trivial eﬀects on absorption and ﬂuorescence frequen-
cies and band-shapes. The vertical excited state reached

1

upon photon absorption has a diﬀerent polarity with re-
spect to the ground state. Immediately after absorption,
the slow degrees of freedom readjust in response to the
new charge distribution of the solute. But, as long as
slow degrees of freedom relax, the solute molecule itself
feels a new surrounding and in turn readjusts its polar-
ity. The non-linear, self-consistent relaxation problem
can be solved exactly in our simple picture, to calcu-
late the equilibrium polarity of the fully relaxed excited
state9. Fluorescence is once more a vertical process that,
starting from the relaxed excited state, leads to the or-
thogonal ground state. Our model then predicts diﬀerent
Huang-Rhys factors for absorption and ﬂuorescence, and
explains the observation of narrower ﬂuorescence than
absorption bands for push-pull chromophores9.

The solvent orientational coordinate describes a very
slow (actually overdamped) motion and is responsible
for inhomogeneous broadening eﬀects in optical spectra.
This broadening can be modeled in terms of a statistical
distribution of q conformations, w(q)10. Since the chro-
mophore readjusts its polarity in response to the solvent
conﬁguration, one ends up with a distribution of chro-
mophore polarities, w(ρ). Broadened spectra are then
calculated as a sum of spectra corresponding to diﬀerent
molecular polarities.

The self-consistent nature of the interactions implies
that slow degrees of freedom are in turn aﬀected by the
coupling to electrons. The most apparent eﬀects can be
found in the dependence of vibrational properties on the
chromophore charge distribution and hence on the sol-
vent polarity. In agreement with experimental data, we
predict solvent-dependent vibrational frequencies and in-
homogeneous broadening of infrared and Raman bands
in polar solvents10. Inhomogeneous broadening, aﬀecting
both electronic and vibrational states in polar solvents,
rationalizes an unusual phenomenon of dispersion of res-
onant Raman bands with the excitation line11, observed
for the dye phenol blue dissolved in polar solvents12.

The dependence of molecular properties and hence of
absorption and emission band-shapes on the conﬁgura-
tion of slow coordinates (in particular the solvation co-
ordinate) is the key to understand some interesting phe-
nomena observed in time-resolved spectra. Recent pump-
probe and femtosecond hole-burning measurements on
push-pull chromophores dissolved in polar solvents13,14
have in fact revealed the appearance of so-called tempo-
rary isosbestic points (TIPs) in transient gain and diﬀer-
ential absorption spectra, respectively. This means that
spectra collected at diﬀerent time delays seem to cross
in an isosbestic point, whose position actually depends
on the chosen time window14. The physical origin of
TIPs has not been understood so far. The only temp-
tative explanation13 invokes the active role of two (or
more) excited states. This explanation is not adequate,
as proved by the fact that TIPs do appear in transient
spectra collected for molecules dissolved in polar solvents
only, while this feature is not observed in non-dipolar sol-
vents13. The appearance of TIPs in transient spectra is

then related to solvation dynamics.

In typical time-resolved experiments, the relaxation of
internal molecular vibrations is in general completed af-
ter the ﬁrst few hundreds of femtosecond following the ex-
citation14, so that subsequent dynamics can be ascribed
to the relaxation of the solvation coordinate toward the
new equilibrium conﬁguration. Then, in the framework
of our model, we can calculate the time evolution of
transient spectra based on the temporal evolution of the
probability distribution w(ρ), which, in turn, can be ob-
tained from the evolution of w(q) on the relevant PES.
In the phase space of coordinate and momentum (q, p)
the evolution of w(q, p) can be described by the Fokker-
Planck equation. In the overdamped regime (friction co-
eﬃcient, γ, greater than ω), relevant to the solvation
coordinate, the Fokker-Planck equation reduces to the
simpler Smoluchowski equation, in the q-space only15:

where V is the anharmonic potential energy for the rele-
vant state, k the Boltzmann constant, T the temperature.
An example of the temporal evolution of w(q) on one of
the PES is given in Fig. 1(a) from t = 0, when an out-
, when
of-equilibrium population is created, to t
equilibrium is reached.
In Fig. 1(b) the corresponding
evolution of w(ρ) is reported: due to anharmonicity and
to the non-linear relation between ρ and q, the distribu-
tion is asymmetric and evolves in width and shape.

Transient properties only depend on γ and ω via the
ratio τ = γ/ω2. In order not to add any adjustable pa-
rameter to the original model, we ﬁx τ to the longitudinal
relaxation time of the pure solvent, as obtained from lit-
erature data. In Fig. 2(a), we show transient emission
spectra, calculated for the parameters reported in the
caption. The evolution of the band-shape, due to the de-
pendence of electronic properties on the conﬁguration of
slow variables, together with the red-shift, is responsible
for the appearance of a TIP. These data reproduce the
gain spectra measured for the polyene PA2 dissolved in
dioxane13. The adopted τ value coincides with the ac-
cepted value of the longitudinal relaxation time of diox-
ane13. Fig. 2(b) refers to a diﬀerent experiment. In par-
ticular, to simulate femtosecond hole-burning spectra of
coumarin 102 (C102) dissolved in CH3CN14, we have cal-
culated transient diﬀerential absorption spectra from an
out-of-equilibrium q-distribution in the ground state, as
obtained by a pump-dump sequence. The spectra, cal-
culated for the model parameters that ﬁt steady-state
spectra of C10216, and for τ = 0.3 ps (the accepted value
for the longitudinal relaxation time of CH3CN13) are in
good agreement with experimental data. Speciﬁcally, the
blue-shift of the transient absorption is accompanied by
an evolution of the absorption band-shape, so that spec-
tra collected in a narrow temporal window all cross in a
unique point. This point is not truly isosbestic and, in
agreement with experimental data, we calculate a slow
blue-shift of its position at increasing time.

The proposed model describes the spectral properties
of conjugated donor-acceptor chromophores in solution
in terms of two electronic states coupled to internal vi-
brations and to solvent degrees of freedom. The model is
simple enough to allow for a full exploitation of the non-
linearity of the electronic system, that manifests itself in
a self-consistent interplay between electronic, vibrational
and solvation degrees of freedom. Signatures of this non-
linearity are recognized in several typical spectral fea-
tures that have not explanation in standard approaches.
The model is semiempirical in nature: the few model
parameters are ﬁxed against experimental data. Then
the applicability of the model itself and the reliability
of the model parameters for a speciﬁc molecule must be
conﬁrmed via the comparison with a large body of ex-
perimental data, much wider than the pool of data used
to ﬁx the parameters. In this respect we underline that
the scope of our model is extremely wide, ranging from
steady-state to time-resolved spectra, from electronic to
vibrational data. Based on available experimental data,
the model has been validated for the phenol blue dye,
whose steady-state electronic and vibrational spectra are
extensively discussed in Ref.11. A second interesting case
study is oﬀered by C102, whose time-resolved electronic
spectra have been discussed in the previous Section. For
this molecule, solvation eﬀects have also been observed
in steady-state and time-resolved vibrational spectra17:
also these eﬀects can be rationalized within our model16.
Linear electron-phonon and solute-solvent interactions
originate, in materials with non-linear responses, large
and non-trivial eﬀects that cannot be understood based
on perturbative treatments.

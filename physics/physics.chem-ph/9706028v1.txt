Reported here are theoretical calculations on the triﬂuo-
romethanesulfonic (triﬂic) acid and water molecules, estab-
lishing molecular scale information necessary to molecular
modeling of the structure, thermodynamics, and ionic trans-
port of Naﬁon(cid:13)R membranes. The optimized geometry de-
termined for the isolated triﬂic acid molecule, obtained from
ab initio molecular orbital calculations, agrees with previous
studies.
In order to characterize side chain ﬂexibility and
accessibility of the acid proton, potential energy and free en-
ergy surfaces for rotation of both carbon-sulfur and sulfur-
oxygen(hydroxyl) bonds are presented. A continuum dielec-
tric solvation model is used to obtain free energies of elec-
trostatic interaction with the solvent. Electrostatic solvation
is predicted to reduce the free energy barrier to rotation of
the F3C-SO3 bond to about 2.7 kcal/mol. This electrostatic
eﬀect is associated with slight additional polarization of the
CF bond in the eclipsed conformation. The energetic barrier
to rotation of the acid hydroxyl group away from the sulfonic
acid oxygen plane, out into the solvent is substantially ﬂat-
tened by electrostatic solvation eﬀects. The maximum free
energy change for those solvent accessible proton conforma-
tions is less than one kcal/mol. We carried out additional
ab initio electronic structure calculations with a probe water
molecule interacting with the triﬂic acid. The minimum en-
ergy structures found here for the triﬂic acid molecule with
the probe water revise results reported previously. To investi-
gate the reaction path for abstraction of a proton from triﬂic
acid, we found minimum energy structures, energies, and free
energies for: (a) a docked conﬁguration of triﬂate anion and
hydronium cation and (b) a transition state for proton in-
terchange between triﬂic acid and a water molecule. Those
conﬁgurations are structurally similar but energetically sub-
stantially diﬀerent. The activation free energy for that proton
interchange is predicted to be 4.7 kcal/mol above the reaction
end-points.

I. INTRODUCTION

Naﬁon(cid:13)R , a perﬂuorinated ionomer widely used in poly-
mer electrolyte fuel cells [1], consists of a hydropho-
bic Teﬂon backbone with randomly attached side chains
terminating with triﬂuoromethanesulfonic (triﬂic) acid
groups. These sulfonic acid functional groups are hy-
drophilic and preferentially hydrated. The Naﬁon(cid:13)R

membrane functions as both a separator and an elec-
trolyte in the fuel cell and the overall performance of the
fuel cell is strongly inﬂuenced by the membrane conduc-
tivity, itself a function of the hydration [2,3,4,5]. The
water content of the membrane is determined both by
equilibrium absorption and by nonequilibrium currents of
ions and water. Extensive experimental measurement of
electroosmotic drag coupling proton and water ﬂuxes for
various sulfonated membranes over a wide range of water
content [6,7,8] has suggested that sulfonic acid interac-
tions dominate proton transport. A molecular level un-
derstanding of these processes in Naﬁon(cid:13)R is not available.
Here we work towards a molecular description of these
systems by securing information on molecular structures,
energies, and charge distribution upon which molecular
scale solution theory might be based.

Electrostatic interactions of triﬂic acid with the envi-
ronment are expected to be of ﬁrst importance in this
solution chemistry. Continuum dielectric solvation mod-
eling is an appropriate approach to studying these so-
lution processes;
it is physical, computationally feasi-
ble, and can provide a basis for more molecular theory
[9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17].

II. COMPUTATIONAL METHODS

A. Electronic Structure Calculations

Standard ab initio molecular orbital calculations were
performed using the GAUSSIAN 92/DFT and 94 [18,19]
systems of programs. Both the 6-31G** split valence
basis set [20] and the D95** Dunning double zeta basis
set [21] were employed at the Hartree-Fock plus second-
order Møller-Plesset (MP2) level of theory. Full geom-
etry optimizations were obtained for isolated triﬂic acid
(CF3SO3H), the triﬂate anion (CF3SO−
3 ), and triﬂic acid
with a probe water molecule (CF3SO3H+H2O) using gra-
dient methods [22]. Atom centered partial charges were
obtained by the CHelpG scheme [23]. Potential energy
surfaces for triﬂic acid were constructed from calculations
at the MP2/6-31G** level by rotation of the carbon-
sulfur and sulfur-oxygen(hydroxyl) bonds with optimiza-
tion of all other degrees of freedom. Finally, the opti-
mized structures and energies were determined for the
triﬂate-hydronium ion pair in two ways: (a) by docking
triﬂate and hydronium ions, each rigidly constrained at

1

their separate equilibrium geometries; and (b) by ﬁnding
a transition state for interchange of a proton in the triﬂic-
acid-water complex as CF3SO3H∗ + HOH = CF3SO3H +
HOH∗ using Synchronous Transit-guided Quasi-Newton
(STQN) methods [24].

B. Dielectric Continuum Model

A continuum dielectric model of aqueous solution
chemistry has become a standard theoretical tool in re-
cent years and discussions of basic issues can be found
elsewhere [15]. The model identiﬁes a solute molecule in
a solution environment, deﬁnes a realistic solute molecu-
lar volume based on the geometry of the molecule, posi-
tions partial charges describing the solute electric charge
distribution in that molecular volume, and assumes that
the solvent exterior to the molecular volume may be ide-
alized as a dielectric continuum. The numerical task is
then the solution of the Poisson equation for which a de-
ﬁned local dielectric constant jumps from one (1.0) inside
the molecular volume to the experimental value for the
solution in the region exterior to the solute molecular vol-
ume. The numerical methods used here were boundary
integral techniques outlined in References [14,15]. The
molecular volume is modeled as the union of spherical
volumes centered on solute atoms. The radii adopted for
those spheres depend on atomic type and are essentially
empirical. Here we used the values determined by Ste-
fanovich and Truong [25]. The value 77.4 was used for
the solvent dielectric constant.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The optimized geometries of both triﬂic acid and the
triﬂate anion are essentially identical to the structures re-
ported by Gejji et al. [26,27] at the same levels of theory.
Both structures are in good agreement with experimen-
tally determined structures [28,29], the only diﬀerence
being that the sulfur-oxygen and carbon-ﬂuorine bond
lengths are 0.03-0.08˚Alonger in the theoretical structures.
To characterize the ﬂexibility of the side chains of the per-
ﬂuorinated membrane and the accessibility of the acidic
protons, potential energy surfaces for triﬂic acid were de-
termined for rotation of the carbon-sulfur bond and the
sulfur-oxygen(hydroxyl) bond. The relative energies for
rotation of both of these bonds are reported in Tables
1 and 2. The conformational potential energy surface
for rotation of the carbon-sulfur bond is given in Figure
1. The highest energy structure occurs when the oxygen
and ﬂuorine atoms are eclipsed and the minimum energy
structure when those atoms are staggered. The activa-
tion energy is 3.5 kcal/mol but the solvation free energy
lowers that barrier to about 2.7 kcal/mol. This is mostly
due to a slight additional polarization of the C-F bonds
in the eclipsed conformation. Figure 2 shows as function

of rotation of the carbon-sulfur bond the atom centered
partial charges obtained for the triﬂic acid molecule. The
sulfur-oxygen(hydroxyl) rotational potential energy sur-
face possesses two physically equivalent minima (Figure
3). The lowest barrier between these minima corresponds
to the proton directed axially, out into the solvent and
has an energy of 2.0 kcal/mol. Electrostatic solvation
substantially ﬂattens that barrier so that the maximum
free energy between the two minima is less than one
kcal/mol. This stabilization of the barrier conﬁguration
is due to the better access of the proton to the solvent.
The position of a probe water molecule interacting with
triﬂic acid was determined by fully optimizing the pair
of molecules at the MP2 level using both the 6-31G**
and D95** basis sets. Recently, Ricchiardi and Ugliengo
[30] reported a geometry optimization of triﬂic acid plus
a water molecule at the SCF/DZP level. Their result is
qualitatively similar but quantitatively substantially dif-
ferent from that presented below. Because our results
diﬀered from those previous ones, several diﬀerent basis
sets and starting conditions were considered. The diﬀer-
ences we observed among those diﬀerence optimizations
were slight and do not account for the diﬀerences with
the previous work. Those diﬀerences may be traceable to
diﬀerent level of eﬀort in achieving the optimum struc-
ture. Our results are shown in Figure 4. That struc-
ture is of lower energy than the structure reported by
Ricchiardi and Ugliengo. However, our experience with
this optimization is that the triﬂic-acid-water conﬁgura-
tions are ﬂoppy as might be expected from noncovalent
hydrogen-bonding interactions. For example, we several
times found a local minimum of the energy surface with
the exterior proton of Figure 4 directed into the plane
of that drawing. Potential energy minima of that sort
are only slightly higher in energy, of the order of one
kcal/mol, than the structure shown. Note that the di-
hedral angle positioning the triﬂic acid proton is nearly
the same in the minimum energy complex and the mini-
mum energy triﬂic acid molecule (Figure 3). The ﬂoppi-
ness of these structures is consistent with the prediction
of the dielectric solvation model that free energy varies
only gently with disposition of the acid proton in the re-
gion between the two minima (Figure 3). Attempts were
made to determine a minimum energy conformation for
triﬂate-hydronium ion pair but those conﬁgurations al-
ways relaxed to the optimum geometry of the triﬂic-acid-
water molecule pair. Separately optimized structures for
the triﬂate anion and the hydronium cation were then
docked in an optimization that adjusted only the rela-
tive positions of the two ions constrained separately to
be rigid. That optimum ion pair geometry is presented
in Figure 4 also. The energy of the docked ion pair is
27.0 kcal/mol higher than the fully optimized molecule
pair. The electrostatic solvation free energy of the docked
ion pair relative to that of the optimized molecular com-
plex is computed to be -16.0 kcal/mol so that net free
energy of the docked ion pair, as a complex, is approxi-
mately 11.0 kcal/mol above that of the minimum energy

2

molecule complex. Further eﬀorts to determine a reac-
tion path for abstraction of the proton from the triﬂic
acid molecule were based upon the observation (Figure
4) that another minimum energy structure for the triﬂic-
acid-water complex is obtained by cycling the triﬂic acid
proton with a distinct water proton to achieve a physi-
cally equivalent but diﬀerent triﬂic-acid-water molecule
pair. This can be alternatively described by considering
that one of the two close protons of the docked hydro-
nium ion will be donated to the triﬂate anion when it is
neutralized. We deﬁned those two possibilities as end-
points for a reaction path and found a transition state
(Figure 4) using STQN methods [26]. Structurally, the
docked ion pair and the transition state are quite simi-
lar. The energy of this transition state is 9.3 kcal/mol
higher than the end-points of the reaction path or about
18 kcal/mol lower in than the energy of the docked struc-
ture. The electrostatic solvation free energy relative to
the reaction end-point is predicted to be -4.6 kcal/mol so
the activation free energy is about 4.7 kcal/mol.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

The results reported here establish molecular scale in-
formation necessary to molecular modeling of the struc-
ture, thermodynamics, and ionic transport of Naﬁon(cid:13)R
membranes. Because of a slight additional polarization
of the CF bond in the eclipsed conformation, electro-
static solvation reduces the free energy barrier to rotation
of the F3C-SO3 bond to about 2.7 kcal/mol. Solvation
enhances the accessibility of the acid proton by substan-
tially ﬂattening the energetic barrier to rotation of the
acid hydroxyl group away from the sulfonic acid oxygen
plane, out into the solvent. The free energy barrier for
those solvent accessible proton conformations is less than
one kcal/mol relative to the minimum energy conforma-
tions. The minimum energy structures found for the tri-
ﬂic acid molecule with the probe water revise structures
reported previously. A doubly hydrogen-bonded conﬁg-
uration is found in which the triﬂic acid proton forms a
short hydrogen-bond. The second hydrogen-bond is of a
more traditional type. Minimum energy structures, en-
ergies, and free energies were found for: (a) a docked
conﬁguration of triﬂate anion and hydronium cation and
(b) a transition state for proton interchange between tri-
ﬂic acid and a water molecule. Those conﬁgurations are
structurally similar but energetically substantially diﬀer-
ent. The activation free energy for that proton inter-
change is predicted to be 4.7 kcal/mol above the reaction
end-points. Experimentally determined values of activa-
tion energies for protonic conductivity in Naﬁon(cid:13)R and
similar perﬂuorosulfonic acid membranes are roughly 3
kcal/mole for a fully hydrated membrane and increases
with decreasing water content [5].

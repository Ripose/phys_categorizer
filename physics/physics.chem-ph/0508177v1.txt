Niels Bohr originally applied his approach to quantum mechanics to the H atom with great success.
He then went on to show in 1913 how the same “planetary-orbit” model can predict binding for
the H2 molecule. However, he misidentiﬁed the correct dissociation energy of his model at large
internuclear separation, forcing him to give up on a “Bohr’s model for molecules”. Recently, we
have found the correct dissociation limit of Bohr’s model for H2 and obtained good potential energy
curves at all internuclear separations. This work is a natural extension of Bohr’s original paper
and corresponds to the D = ∞ limit of a dimensional scaling (D-scaling) analysis, as developed by
Herschbach and coworkers.

In a separate but synergetic approach to the two-electron problem, we summarize recent advances
in constructing analytical models for describing the two-electron bond. The emphasis here is not
maximally attainable numerical accuracy, but beyond textbook accuracy as informed by physical
insights. We demonstrate how the interplay of the cusp condition, the asymptotic condition, the
electron-correlation, conﬁguration interaction, and the exact one electron two-center orbitals, can
produce energy results approaching chemical accuracy. To this end, we provide a tutorial on using
the Riccati form of the ground state wave function as a uniﬁed way of understanding the two-
electron wave function and collect a detailed account of mathematical derivations on the exact
one-electron two-center wave functions. Reviews of more traditional calculational approaches, such
as Hartree-Fock, are also given.

The inclusion of electron correlation via Hylleraas type functions is well known to be important,
but diﬃcult to implement for more than two electrons. The use of the D-scaled Bohr model oﬀers
the tantalizing possibility of obtaining electron correlation energy in a non-traditional way.

INTRODUCTION

A. Overview

We are in the midst of a revolution at the interface between chemistry and physics, largely due to the interplay
between quantum optics and quantum chemistry. For example, the explicit control of molecules aﬀorded by modern
femtosecond lasers and adaptive computer feedback [1] has opened new frontiers in molecular science. In such studies,
molecules are controlled by sculpting the amplitude and phase of femtosecond pulses, forcing the molecule into
predetermined electronic and rotational-vibrational states. This holds great promise for vital applications, from the
trace detection of molecular impurities, such as dipicolinic acid as it appears in anthrax [2], to the utilization of
molecular excited states for quantum information storage and retrieval [3].

We are thus motivated to rethink certain aspects of molecular physics and quantum chemistry especially with regard
to the excited state dynamics and coherent processes of molecules. The usual discussions of molecular structure are
based on solving the many-particle Schr¨odinger equation with varying degree of sophistication, from exacting Diﬀusion
Monte Carlo methods, coupled cluster expansion, conﬁguration interactions, to density functional theory. All are
intensely numerical. Despite these successful tools of modern computational chemistry, there remains the need for
understanding electron correlations in some relatively simple way so that we may describe excited states dynamics
with reasonable accuracy.

In this work, we propose to reexamine these questions in two complementary ways. One approach is based on the
recently resurrected Bohr’s model for molecules [4, 5]. In particular, we show that by modifying the original Bohr’s
model [6] in a simple way, specially when augmented by dimensional scaling (D-scaling), we can describe both the
singlet and triplet potential of H2 with remarkable accuracy (see Figs. 2, 5).

In another approach, following the lead of the French school of Le Sech [7, 8], we use correlated two-center orbitals
2 molecule to model H2’s ground and excited state. This approach worked well, even when only a simple

of the H+
electron correlation function is used, see Table I.

When we allow the α and B parameters of Eqs. (VI.55) and (VI.58) to vary, we obtain a binding energy of 4.7 eV. The
binding energy is comparable to the experimental value of 4.7 eV.

The Bohr model and D-scaling technique taken together with good (uncorrelated) molecular orbitals is especially
interesting and promising. As discussed in subsection C, the Bohr model yields a good approximation to the electron-
electron Coulomb energy, which can be used to choose a renormalized nuclear charge and a much improved (correlated)
two electron wave function.

B. The Bohr molecule

Figure 1 displays the Bohr model for a hydrogen molecule [4, 5, 6], in which two nuclei with charges Z

are
separated by a ﬁxed distance R (adiabatic approximation) and the two electrons move in the space between them.
The model assumes that the electrons move with constant speed on circular trajectories of radii ρ1 = ρ2 = ρ. The

FIG. 1: Cylindrical coordinates (top) and electronic distances (bottom) in H2 molecule. The nuclei Z are ﬁxed at a distance R
apart. In the Bohr model, the two electrons rotate about the internuclear axis z with coordinates ρ1, z1 and ρ2, z2 respectively;
the dihedral angle φ between the (ρ1, z1) and (ρ2, z2) planes remains constant at either φ = π or φ = 0. The sketch corresponds
to conﬁguration 2 of Fig. 2, with φ = π.

constant. The net force on each electron consists of three contributions: attractive interaction between an electron
and the two nuclei, the Coulomb repulsion between electrons, and the centrifugal force on the electron. We proceed
by writing the energy function E = T + V , where the kinetic energy T = p2
2/2m for electrons 1 and 2 can be
obtained from the quantization condition that the circumference is equal to the integer number n of the electron de
Broglie wavelengths 2πρ = nh/p, so that we have T = p2/2m = n2~2/2mρ2; the unit of distance is taken to be the
Bohr radius a0 = ~2/me2, and the unit of energy the atomic energy, e2/a0 where m and e are, respectively, the mass
and charge of the electron. The Coulomb potential energy V is given by

which are seen to be equivalent to Newton’s second law applied to the motion of each electron. Eq. (I.3) speciﬁes that
the total Coulomb force on the electron along the z
axis is equal to zero; Eq. (I.4) speciﬁes that the projection of
the Coulomb force toward the molecular axis equals the centrifugal force. At any ﬁxed internuclear distance R, these
equations determine the constant values of ρ and z that describe the electron trajectories. Similar force equations
pertain for the other extremum conﬁgurations.

In Fig. 2 (lower panel) we plot E(R) for the four Bohr model conﬁgurations (solid curves), together with “exact”
results (dots) obtained from extensive variational calculations for the singlet ground state 1Σ+
g , and the lowest triplet
state, 3Σ+
u [9]. In the model, the three conﬁgurations 1, 2, 3 with the electrons on opposite sides of the internuclear
axis (φ = π) are seen to correspond to the 1Σ+
g singlet ground states, whereas the other solution 4 with the electrons
on the same side (φ = 0) corresponds to the ﬁrst excited, 3Σ+
u triplet state. At small internuclear distances, the
symmetric conﬁguration 1 originally considered by Bohr agrees well with the “exact” ground state quantum energy;
at larger R, however, this conﬁguration’s energy rises far above that of the ground state and ultimately dissociates
to the doubly ionized limit, 2H++2e. In contrast, the solution for the asymmetric conﬁguration 2 appears only for
R > 1.20 and in the large R limit dissociates to two H atoms. The solution for asymmetric conﬁguration 3 exists only
for R > 1.68 and climbs steeply to dissociate to an ion pair, H++H−. The asymmetric solution 4 exists for all R and
corresponds throughout to repulsive interaction of two H atoms.

energy is 1 a.u.= 27.21 eV, and unit of distance is the Bohr radius.

g and ﬁrst excited 3Σ+

We then extend these “Bohr molecule” studies in several ways. In particular, we use a variant of the dimensional
scaling (D scaling) theory as it was originally developed in quantum chromodynamics and applied with great success

to molecular and statistical physics [10, 11]. This is based on an analysis in which the usual kinetic energy terms in
the Schr¨odinger equation are written in D dimensions, i.e.,

This provides another avenue into the interface between the old (Bohr-Sommerfeld) and the new (Heisenberg-
Schr¨odinger) quantum mechanics. In particular, when D
the two electron Schr¨odinger equation can be scaled
and sculpted into a form which is when D
identical to the Bohr theory of the H2 molecule, and much better
→ ∞
than when 1/D or other corrections are included.

C. Simple correlation energy from the Bohr model

The Bohr model oﬀers an eﬀective way to treat most of the correlation energy absent in the conventional Hartree–
Fock (HF) approximation. Here we show how a charge renormalization method can be applied to improve the ground
state energy obtained in the HF approximation. We start from He-like ions and consider a nucleus with charge Z and
two electrons moving around it. According to the Bohr model the ground state energy is given by the minimum of
the following expression

The HF approximation in the framework of the Bohr model means that optimum parameters ρ1 and ρ2 are determined

The eﬀective charge improves the Bohr model energy by taking into account the diﬀerence between the quasiclassical
and fully quantum mechanical description. The eﬀective charge is calculated from the correspondence between the
Bohr model in the HF approximation and the quantum mechanical HF answer. Now, if we take the Bohr model

D. Correlated two-center orbitals

¿From the preceding discussion it is clear that we need good (hopefully simple) HF wave functions. There is, of
course, a great deal of work on this problem but we ﬁnd the two-center orbital approach of Le Sech and coworkers [7, 8,
13, 14, 15] and of Patil [16] to be especially useful. In a previous publication [17], we attempted a ﬁrst principle (semi-
tutorial) presentation employing that the exact two-center orbitals obtained from solving the Schr¨odinger equation
for the H+
2 ion. As shown by Le Sech these are the most useful building blocks for constructing the electronic wave
functions of the homonuclear H2 molecule. One simple form of the electronic ground state constructed with two-center
orbitals is

discussions of (I.16) in Sections IV–VI below. This wave function yields a binding energy of 4.5 eV for H2 molecule
without any variational parameters. Variation with respect to a couple of parameters in the function (I.16) shifts
the binding energy to 4.7 eV, giving remarkable agreement with the experimental value. To achieve the same result,
sums over many one-centered atomic orbitals or Hylleraas type of wave function (cf. (IV.30) below) that explicitly
include the interelectronic distance are usually used. This has been demonstrated by the earlier work of Kolos and
Wolniewicz [18]. Kolos and Szalewicz [19], and that of James and Coolidge [20], respectively.

In these studies the introduction of a correlation factor, taking into account the Coulomb interaction between the

two electrons, is naturally motivated by considering the trial wave function as broken into three parts, we write

where Ψ(r1) and Ψ(r2) are exact one electron solutions in the absence of interaction between electrons. For Ψ(r1, r2)
the Schr¨odinger equation (in atomic units) gives

that is the solution to Eq. (I.19) is well known [22] and is given in terms of Coulomb wave functions, i.e., conﬂuent
hypergeometric functions (see more detailed discussions in Subsection V.B), which yields the (1 + r12/2) Hylleraas
factor as an asymptotic at small r12. In order to place this part of the present review in perspective and be ready for
the paradigm shift from the old quasi quantum-mechanical Bohr model to the new fully wave-mechanical Schr¨odinger–
Born–Oppenheimer model, we next give a brief history of the molecular orbital concepts and computations.

E. Context

Molecular quantum chemistry is a fascinating success story in the annals of 20th Century science.

In 1926,
Schr¨odinger introduced the all-important wave equation which soon bore his name. In the following year Schr¨odinger’s
new theory was applied to the simplest molecular systems of the hydrogen molecular ion H+
2 by Burrau [23] and to
the hydrogen molecule H2 by Heitler and London [24] and Condon [25]. In the same year, Born and Oppenheimer [26]
published their important paper dealing with molecular nuclear motion. Further, in 1928, Hund and Mulliken [27]
presented their venerable molecular orbital (MO) theory, which provided a powerful computational tool for chemistry
and a foundation for the subsequent development of modern molecular science.

Diatomic molecules such as H2 and HeH+ are the simplest of all molecules. Their analysis, modeling and compu-
tation constitute the bedrock of the study of chemical bonds in molecular structures. To quote a recent insightful
article by Cotton and Nocera [28]:

“It can be said without fear of contradiction that the two-electron bond is the single most important
stereoelectronic feature of chemistry.”

Indeed, the description of the covalent bond in diatomics, based on the methods of Heitler–London and Hund–Mulliken,
is one of the crowning achievements of quantum mechanics and fundamental physics.

Computational quantum chemistry dawned in 1927 with the advent of the Heitler–London method. However, the
accuracy of these early numerical results were not satisfactory, as can be seen from the following quotation (Hinchliﬀe
[29, p. 254]):

“The calculated bond length and dissociation energy [of MO theory] are in poor agreement with experiment
than those obtained from simple VB [valence bond] treatment (Table 15.3), and this puzzled many people
at the time. It has also led them to believe that the VB method was the correct way forward for the
description of molecular structure . . . .”

9

New ideas were then proposed to improve the numerical accuracy of the Heitler–London and Hund–Mulliken method.
The ﬁrst idea of conﬁguration interaction (CI) is to incorporate excited states into the wave function. The second
idea of correlation introduces explicit dependence of the interelectronic distance in the wave function. The idea of
correlation was ﬁrst demonstrated by Hylleraas [30] in 1929 for the helium atom and by James and Coolidge [20] in
1933 for H2. The use of conﬁguration interaction and correlation are key evolutionary steps in improving the original
ideas of Heitler–London and Hund–Mulliken. We can quote the following from Rychlewski [31]:

“. . . Very soon it has been realized that inclusion of interelectronic distance into the wave function is
a powerful way of improving the accuracy of calculated results . . . . Today, methods based on explic-
itly correlated wave functions are capable of yielding the “spectroscopic” accuracy in molecular energy
calculations (errors less than the orders of one µ Hartree) . . . .”

For more than two electrons, it is diﬃcult for most numerical methods to include electron correlations directly except
in Monte Carlo simulations. When it is possible, as in the two electron case, excellent results can be achieved with
very compact wave functions.

Molecular calculations are inherently more diﬃcult than atomic calculations. The fundamental diﬃculty is well

stated by Teller and Sahlin [32]:

“The molecular problem has a greater inherent complexity than the corresponding atomic problem.... In
atoms, degeneracy due to spherical symmetry causes many levels to have nearly the same energy. This
grouping of levels is responsible for the presence of a shell structure in atoms, and this shell structure is
in turn the primary reason for the striking and simple behavior of atoms and the consequent successes
of the independent-electron approximation for atomic systems. In passing from atoms to molecules the
symmetry is reduced and the amount of degeneracy for the electronic levels becomes smaller, and, as a
consequence, the power of the independent-particle model is decreased relative to the atomic case.”

Nothing illustrates this loss of symmetry, and its consequent loss of validity of the independent-particle picture better
than the complete failure of the molecular orbital picture to account for the correct dissociation energy of H2. At large
internuclear separation, the symmetry is greatly reduced, and the independent occupation of single-particle molecular
orbitals fails catastrophically. This failure can of course be averted by conﬁguration-interaction, but this extra work
makes it plain that molecular problems are inherently more complicated than atomic problems. Fortunately, for the
investigation of ground and excited molecular states near equilibrium, one is far from the dissociation limit; the loss
of symmetry complicates the calculation of the molecular orbital, but the independent particle model remains a good
approximation.

In the case of H2, a natural candidate is the orbital of the two-center one-electron molecular ion. Such orbitals will be
referred to as diatomic orbitals (DO) or, in more complicated cases, shielded diatomic orbitals (SDO) when shielding is
a factor to be considered. The early (1930s) ansatz wave functions of James and Coolidge [20] are expressed in terms
of prolate spheroidal coordinates of the two electrons with respect to the two centers of the diatomic nuclei. However,
their wave functions are not DOs in that they are not expansions of the exact one electron H+
2 states. Rather, their
approach is CI with a basis conveniently chosen for numerical evaluation. Their work is the forerunner of the Polish
quantum chemistry group [9, 18, 19] of Kolos, Wolniewicz, etc., which have achieved the highest accuracy in numerical
computation of two-electron molecules. The high accuracy obtained by Kolos and Wolniewicz in [18] is admirable,
but as noted by Patil, Tang and Toennies [16],

“. . . It is, however, perhaps somewhat unfortunate that these very impressive accomplishments have largely
discouraged further fundamental studies on novel approaches to obtain accurate wave functions more
directly . . . .”

A similar comment was made much earlier by Mulliken [33]:

“[T]he more accurate the calculations become the more concepts tend to vanish into thin air.”

Thus the human quest for comprehension remains, and the recent research on novel approaches to obtain accurate
wave functions have indeed yielded accurate, physically motivated, and compact two-electron wave functions. Patil
et al.
[34, 35, 37, 38, 39, 40] have advocated the construction of coalescense wave functions by incorporating both
cusp and asymptotic conditions. We have provided a detailed review with simplﬁed derivations of this development
in Section III. The other approach is the use of diatomic orbitals. Historically, the original idea of using DOs as
basis for diatomic molecules seems to begin from the work of Wallis and Hulburt [41]. More extensive references and
history can be found in the works of Mclean, Weiss and Yoshimine [42], Teller and Sahlin [32] and Shull [43]. Wallis
and Hulburt’s result was not particularly successful, because there was no explicit electron correlation and solving
the two-center wave function was diﬃcult. According to Aubert, Bessis and Bessis [13, Part I, p. 51]:

10

“. . . the use of these functions, i.e., diatomic orbitals (DOs), within the one-conﬁguration molecular-orbital
scheme has not been very successful, owing to the diﬃculty of taking into account the interelectronic
interactions and, moreover, owing to the complexity of calculations.”

The calculation of H+

2 wave function improved over the years, culminating in the extensive tabulations by Teller
and Sahlin [32]. In 1974–75, Aubert, Bessis and Bessis published a three-part series [13] detailing how to determine
SDOs for diatomic molecules. These three papers emphasize the determination of shielded DOs. Surprisingly, the use
of DO with correlation to study H2 was not undertaken until 1981 by Aubert–Fr´econ and Le Sech [14]. Le Sech, et
al. have since then made further reﬁnements to the method (Siebbeles and Le Sech [15], Le Sech [7]).

Our study of the DO’s approach was motivated by our strong interest in the modeling and computation of molecules.
We were especially attracted by DOs as a natural and accurate description of chemical bonds. In Scully et al. [17],
largely unaware of the prior work done by Aubert–Fr´econ and Le Sech of the French school, we obtained simple
correlated DOs for diatomic molecules with good accuracy. The present paper represents part of our continued
eﬀorts in this direction. In this work, we will ﬁrst study the mathematical properties of wave functions such as their
cusp conditions, asymptotic behaviors, and forms of correlation functions. We summarize methods, techniques and
formulas in a tutorial style, interspersed with some unpublished results of our own. It it not our intention to complete
an exhaustive review on this vast subject, rather, only to record developments relevant to our interest in suﬃcient
details. We apologize in advance for any inadvertent omissions.

The present paper is organized as follows:

(i) In Section II, we present some recent progress of an interpolated Bohr model.

F. Outline

(ii) In Section III, we discuss some general and fundamental properties of atoms and molecules, including the Born–
Oppenheimer separation, the Feynman–Hellman Theorem, Riccati form of the ground state wave function,
proximal and asymptotic conditions, the coalescent construction and the dissociation limit.

(iii) In Section IV, we introduce the basics of the 1-electron two-centered orbitals from the classic explicit solutions

of Hylleraas and Jaﬀ´e. The one-centered and multi-centered orbitals will also be reviewed.

(iv) In Section V, we present the details of the derivations of the all-important cusp conditions of Kato, and show
examples as to how to verify them in prolate spheroidal coordinates. We also provide a glossary of various
correlation functions that satisfy the interelectronic cusp condition.

(v) In Section VI, we discuss numerical modeling of diatomic molecules and compare results with the classic methods
such as the Heitler–London, Hund–Muliken, Hartree–Fock and James–Coolidge, and the new approach of two-
centered orbitals by Le Sech, et al.

(vi) In Section VII we discuss alternative methods for molecular calculations based on the generalized Bohr model

and the dimensional scaling.

(vii) Finally, in Section VIII we give our conclusions and present an outlook.

II. RECENT PROGRESS BASED ON BOHR’S MODEL

The diatomic molecules in a fully quantum mechanical treatment addressed in Subsection I.E requires solution of the
many-particle Schr¨odinger equation. However, such an approach also requires complicated numerical algorithms. As a
consequence, for a few electron problem the results become less accurate and sometimes unreliable. This is pronounced
for excited electron states when the application of the variational principle is much less involved. Therefore, invention
of simple and, at the same time, relatively accurate methods of molecule description is quite desirable.

In this section we discuss a method which is based on the Bohr model and its modiﬁcation [4, 5]. In particular,
we show that for H2 a simple extension of the original Bohr model [6] describes the potential energy curves for the
lowest singlet and triplet states just about as nicely as those from the wave mechanical treatment.

The simplistic Bohr model provides surprisingly accurate energies for the ground singlet state at large and small
internuclear distances and for the triplet state over the full range of R. Also, the model predicts the ground state
0.100 a.u.= 2.73 eV. The
is bound with an equilibrium separation Re ≈
Heitler–London calculation, obtained from a two-term variational function, yields Re = 1.51 and EB = 3.14 eV [24],

1.10 and gives the binding energy as EB ≈

11

whereas the “exact” results are Re = 1.401 and EB = 4.74 eV [9]. For the triplet state, as seen in Fig. 2, the
Bohr model gives a remarkably close agreement with the “exact” potential curve and is in fact much better than the
Heitler–London result (which, e.g., is 30% higher for R = 2). One should mention that in 1913, Bohr found only the
symmetric conﬁguration solution, which fails drastically to describe the ground state dissociation limit.

The simple Bohr model oﬀers valuable insights for the description of other diatomic molecules. For N electrons the

model reduces to ﬁnding conﬁgurations that deliver extrema of the energy function

E =

+ V (r1, r2, ..., rN , R),

(II.1)

N

where the ﬁrst term is the electron kinetic energy, while V is the Coulomb potential energy. In such formulation
of the model there is no need to specify electron trajectories nor to incorporate nonstationary electron motion. Eq.
(II.1) assumes that only at some moment in time the electron angular momentum equals an integer number of ~ and
the energy is minimized under this constraint. In the general case, the angular momentum of each electron changes
with time; nevertheless, the total energy remains a conserved quantity.

Let us now discuss the ground state potential curve of HeH. To incorporate the Pauli exclusion principle one can
use a prescription based on the sequential ﬁlling of the electron levels. In the case of HeH the three electrons can
not occupy the same lowest level of HeH++. As a result, we must disregard the lowest potential energy curve E(R)
obtained by the minimization of Eq. (II.1) and take the next possible electron conﬁguration, which is shown in Fig.
3 (upper panel). For this conﬁguration, n1 = n2 = n3 = 1, however, the right energy corresponds to a saddle point
rather than to a global minimum. In order to obtain the correct dissociation limit we assign the helium an eﬀective
charge Z eﬀ
He = 1.954. The charge matches the diﬀerence between the exact ground state energy of the He atom and
the Bohr model result. Fig. 3 shows the ground state potential curve of HeH in the Bohr model (solid curve) and the
“exact” result (dots) obtained from extensive variational calculations [44]. The Bohr model gives a remarkably close
agreement with the “exact” potential curve.

A.

Interpolated Bohr model

The original Bohr model assumes quantization of the electron angular momentum relative to the molecular axis.
This yields a quite accurate description of the H2 ground state E(R) at small R. However, E(R) becomes less accurate
at larger internuclear separation as seen in Fig. 2. To obtain a better result one can use the following observation.
At large R each electron in H2 feels only the nearest nuclear charge because the remaining charges form a neutral H
atom. Therefore, at large R the momentum quantization relative to the nearest nuclei, rather than to the molecular
axis, must yield a better answer. This leads to the following expression for the energy of the H2 molecule

For n1 = n2 = 1 and R > 2.8 the expression (II.2) has a local minimum for the asymmetric conﬁguration 2 of Fig.
2. We plot the corresponding E(R) without the 1/R term in Fig. 4 (curve 2). At R < 2.8 the electrons collapse into
nuclei. At small R we apply the quantization condition relative to the molecular axis which yields curve 1 in Fig. 4.
To ﬁnd E(R) at intermediate separation we connect smoothly the two regions by a third order polynomial (thin line).
Addition of the 1/R term yields the ﬁnal potential curve, plotted in Fig. 5. The simple interpolated Bohr model
provides a remarkably close agreement with the “exact” potential curve over the full range of R.

two regions.

As an example of application of the interpolated Bohr model to other diatomic molecules, we discuss the ground
state potential curve of LiH. The Li atom contains three electrons, two of which ﬁll the inner shell. Only the outer
electron with the principal quantum number n = 2 is important in forming the molecular bond. This makes the
description of LiH similar to the excited state of H2 in which two electrons possess n1 = 1 and n2 = 2. So, we start
from the H2 excited state and apply the interpolated Bohr model as described above. Then, to obtain E(R) for LiH,
we take the H2 potential curve and add the diﬀerence between the ground state energy of Li (-7.4780 a.u.) and H in
the n = 2 state, i.e., add
7.3530 a.u. The ﬁnal result is shown in Fig. 6 (lower solid line), while dots are the “exact”
numerical answer from [45]. One can see that the simple interpolated Bohr model provides quite good quantitative
description of the potential curve of LiH, which is already a relatively complex four electron system.

fully quantum mechanical model and its approximation and analysis.

A. The Born–Oppenheimer separation

The underlying theoretical basis for problems involving a few particles in atomic and molecular physics is the
Schr¨odinger equation for the electrons and nuclei, which provides satisfactory explanations of the chemical, electro-
magnetic and spectroscopic properties of the atoms and molecules. Assume that the system under consideration has

N1 nuclei with masses MK and charges eZK, e being the electron charge, for K = 1, 2, . . . , N1, and N2 =

ZK is

the number of electrons. The position vector of the Kth nucleus will be denoted as RRRK, while that of the kth electron
will be rrrk, for k = 1, 2, . . . , N2. Let m be the mass of the electron. The Schr¨odinger equation for the overall system
is given by

The above equation is often too complex for practical purposes of studying molecular problems. Born and Oppen-
heimer [26] provide a reduced order model by approximation, permitting a particularly accurate decoupling of the
motions of the electrons and the nuclei. The main idea is to assume that Ψ in (III.1) takes the form of a product

Ψ(RRR, rrr) = G(RRR)F (RRR, rrr).

C. Fundamental properties of one and two-electron wave functions

1. Riccati form, proximal and asymptotic conditions

In this subsection, we introduce the Riccati form of the ground state wave functions as a uniﬁed way of understanding
and deriving various cusp, asymptotic and correlation functions. This forms the basis by which compact wave functions
for diatomic molecules can be derived. Consider the Schr¨odinger equation with a spherically symmetric potential in
reduced units,

where µ = 1 is the central-force case, and µ = 1

2 is

the equal-mass, relative coordinate case. We will be primary

however, the long range Coulomb potential is special in many ways and we can best understand the Coulomb-potential
wave function by comparing and contrasting it to the short-range, Lennard-Jones potential

The advantage of this equation is that since the RHS is a constant E0, all the singularities of V (r) must be cancelled by
the derivatives of S(r). In particular, if we are only seeking an approximate ground state, then a reasonable criterion
would be to require S(r) to cancel the most singular term in V (r). For both the Coulomb and the Lennard-Jones case,
the potential is most singular as r
0. We will refer to this as the proximal limit. For both cases, the singularity of
V (r) is only polynomial in r and therefore we can assume

In the Coulomb case, these proximal conditions are known as cusp conditions. A more thorough treatment of the cusp
condition for the general case will be given in Subsection V.A and Appendices F and H. The proximal criterion of
cancelling the leading singularity of V (r) can be applied generally to any V (r). The cusp conditions are just special
cases for the Coulomb potential. Note that in (III.28), the Coulomb singularity is actually cancelled only by the
S ′/(µr) term of the Riccati equation,

The constant terms determine

Setting the sum of 1/r terms zero gives,

the asymptotic wave function for any short-ranged potential (decays faster than 1/r) must be of the form

Thus the general asymptotic wave function for a Coulomb potential has a slower decay,

For a single electron in a central Coulomb ﬁeld, µ = 1, ˜Z = Z, α = Z, β = 0, and

the decay is the slowest, very diﬀerent from (III.31). For more than one electron, or more than one nuclear charge,

α
we are too familiar with the single-electron wave function, which is the exception, rather than the norm.

The proximal and asymptotic conditions are very stringent constraints: wave functions that can satisfy both are
inevitably close to the exact wave functions. Satisfying the proximal condition alone is suﬃcient to guarantee an
excellent approximate ground state for all radial symmetric potentials such as the Lennard-Jones, the Yukawa (V =

For the case where there are more than two electrons, one can imagine building up the atom or molecule sequentially
one electron at a time. Each electron would then acquire a diﬀerent Coulomb-potential wave function. This sequential,
or coalescence scenario of approximating the ground state, in many cases, resulted in better wave functions than
considering all the electrons simultaneously, which is the traditional Hartree–Fock point of view; see Subsection VI.C.

For Z = 2, this gives α = 1.30 (for small Z, we need to use the full expression rather than the approximation), an
excellent estimate. This obviates the need for Patil’s self-consistent procedure to determine α, and produces even
slightly better results. The coalescent wave function (III.40) with this choice for α, deﬁnes a set of parameter-free
two-electron wave functions for all Z. The resulting energy for Z = 2

To gain further insight into Eckart’s result, and coalescence wave function in general, we note that (III.43) can be

rewritten as

χ(r1, r2) = e−

A(r1+r2) cosh [B(r1 −
b)/2. This form has the HF part e−

r2)] ,

A(r1+r2). If we substitute Eckart’s values, we
with A = (a + b)/2 and B = (a
see that A = (2.1832 + 1.1885)/2 = 1.6859, which is nearly identical to the eﬀective charge value (III.41). This is not
accidental. If we use the approximation (III.42) for α, then the coalescence wave function (III.40) would automatically
predict

Thus within the class of Eckart wave function (III.43), the coalescence scenario correctly predicts the path of optimal
energy as being along A = Zeﬀ. Moreover, this improvement in energy, which has laid dormant in Eckart’s result
for three quarters of a century, can now be understood as due to the radial correlation cosh term in (III.46), built-in
automatically by the coalescence construction. This term is the smallest (=1) when r1 = r2, but is large when the
r2 is large, i.e., it encourages the two electrons to be separated in the radial direction.
separation r1 −
This suggests that we should reexamine Eckart’s energy functional in terms of parameters A and B. Expanding
(III.44) to fourth order in B yields,

where y

B2/A. If B = 0, A = Zeﬀ this yields the eﬀective charge energy

where we have restored the 1/A term. This remarkably simple result is the content of Eckart’s energy functional. The
energy is lower from the eﬀective charge value by a nearly constant amount 3/128. In column three of Table III, we
compare this approximate energy (III.49), with the absolute minimum of the Eckart’s energy functional on the fourth
column. The agreement is uniformly excellent. By comparison, we see that the coalescence construction,without
invoking any minimization process, also gives a very good account of the energy minimum.

3. Electron correlation functions

Coalescence wave functions are better than HF wave function because they have built-in radial correlations. To
further improve our description of He, as ﬁrst realized by Hylleraas [30], one can introduce electron-electron correlation
directly by forcing the two-electron wave function to depend on r12 explicitly. (A more detailed discussion of correlation
functions will be given in Subsection V.B below.) Again, our analysis is simpliﬁed by use of the Riccati function. Let

of the ground state of H+

function is that that (III.68) can satisfy both the cusp and the asymptotic condition. We can simplify Patil et al’s
discussion by rewriting the GZ wave function, again, in the form

Only the ﬁrst parenthesis, the Heilter-London wave function, gives the correct energy of two well separated atoms with

2 Z 2). The remaining parenthesis describes, in the case of H2, the ionic conﬁguration of H−H+, which
energy E = 2(
has higher energy than two separated neutral hydrogen atoms. Thus the molecular orbital approach (III.75) will alway
overshoot the correct dissociation limit. This is a fundamental shortcoming of the molecular orbital approach and
cannot be cured by merely improving the one-electron wave function, i.e., by use of the exact one-electron, two-center
wave function. Even the coalescent construction cannot overcome this fundamental problem. In the large R limit,
the inner electron’s wave function must be (III.76), and hence no matter how one constructs the outer electron’s
asymptotic wave function, one can never reproduces the Heilter-London wave function. In both the molecular orbital
and the coalescent approach, one must resort to conﬁguration interaction to achieve the correct dissociation limit.
Even if one were to use the exact one-electron wave function in doing conﬁguration intereaction, as it was done by
Siebbeles and Le Sech [15], the energy still overshoots the correct dissociation limit if the correlation (1 + 1
2 r12) is
used. This is because we must have f (r12)

const in order to reproduce the Heilter-London limit.

However, one can learn from Guillemin and Zener’s approach, and insist on a wave function that is correct in both

To estimate the form of the correlation function f (r12), we repeat our analysis as in the Helium case. The two-

S(r1, r2, r12) = Zr1a + Zr2b + g(r12),

but without the need of consulting hypergeometric functions. For the H2 case, C = 5/12 = 0.42. In our calculation
with wave function (III.78), with fP J (r12) given by (III.58), the energy minimum at intermediate values of R is at
C = 0.40, in excellent agreement with the predicted value. Since C
0.50 for Helium, C’s variation with R is very
mild.

The resulting energy for the wave function (III.78), is given in Fig. 8 (solid line). We vary the parameter B, while
the other parameters A and C are ﬁxed by Eqs.
(III.71) and (III.83). The parameter B is 0.8 for R < 2, and
moves graduately toward one at larger values of R. The energy at equilibrium is as good as Siebbeles and Le Sech’s
calculation [15] with unscaled H+
2 r12) (triangles). Without conﬁguration
interaction, Siebbeles and Le Sech’s energy overshot the dissociatin limit as shown. The wave function (III.78) can
be further improved by adding a coalescense component `a la Patil, Tang and Toennies [16]. This will be detailed in
the next subsection.

6. Construction of trial wave functions by Patil and coworkers

The previous discussion demonstrates that relatively simple wave functions which incorporate the cusp conditions
and the large distance asymptotics, having no or only a few variational parameters, can be constructed to yield fairly
accurate results. Here we mention other similar trial wave functions studied in the literature. The importance of the
local properties in the calculation of the chemical bond has been emphasized by Patil and coworkers [16, 37, 38, 39, 40,
57]. Their analysis is in the spirit of our previous discussion, however, yields more complicated trial wave functions.
Here we brieﬂy mention the main aspects of the construction scheme and, to be speciﬁc, consider the ground state of
H2 molecule described by the Schr¨odinger equation (III.74).

The electron-nucleus cusp conditions do not uniquely deﬁne the space wave function Φ(r1, r2).
If one wishes to
maintain the electronic conﬁguration idea with an independent particle picture, one can adopt the following form of
Φ(r1, r2):

with φ(rj ), j = 1, 2, being the Guillemin-Zener [54] trial wave function for H+

give the correct dissociation limit of H2. However, for the pedagogical reason we brieﬂy discuss it here.

Eqs. (III.94), (III.96) determine z1 and z2 self-consistently together with the ground state energy E.

Kleinekath¨ofer et al. [34] used the trial function (III.88), (III.91), (III.92) with λ, z1 and z2 determined from Eqs.
(III.90), (III.94), (III.96). The wave function has no free parameters and yields 4.661 eV for the binding energy of the
H2 molecule which is very close to the exact value of 4.745 eV. However, E(R) becomes less accurate at large R and
fails to describe the dissociation limit. The corresponding E(R) is shown as a small dot line (Patil et al. 1) in Fig. 8.
Both the cusp conditions and the large distance asymptotic can be satisﬁed exactly provided more sophisticated trial
functions are introduced. For example, for small and intermediate R, Patil et al. [16] suggested to use a combination
of “inner” and “outer” molecular orbitals which are build from the Guillemin-Zener one-electron wave functions:

Ψm(r1, r2) = [φin(r1)φout(r2) + φin(r2)φout(r1)]fP (r12),

where the “inner” orbital is

Analogously, an “outer” orbital is deﬁned as

φin(rj ) = exp(

z1rja −

−

z2rjb) + exp(

z2rja −

−

z1rjb).

φout(rj ) = exp(

z3rja −

−

z4rjb) + exp(

z4rja −

−

z3rjb).

All the parameters z1, z2, z3 and z4 are determined by the cusp and asymptotic conditions.

At large R, the atomic orbital wave function provides a better description of the two electron system. The appro-

Ψa(r1, r2) = [Φ(r1, r2) + Φ(r2, r1)]fP (r12),

(III.100)

priate wave function is [16]

where

Φ(r1, r2) = exp[

Z(r1a + r1b + r2a + r2b)]

−

cosh(z5r1b) cosh(z6r2a) + cosh(z6r1b) cosh(z5r2a)
}
{

.

(III.101)

Eq. (III.100) satisﬁes all the electron-nucleus cusp conditions. At the same time, it has two free parameters z5 and
z6 which can be used to satisfy the two asymptotic conditions.

For a description in the entire range of internuclear distances, one can use a linear combination of the two wave

functions just discussed

Ψ = Ψm + DΨa,

(III.102)

where D is a variational parameter. For H2 the molecular orbital Ψm dominates in the region R < 1.7, while the
atomic orbital Ψa dominates at R > 1.7. With this complicated one parameter wave function Patil et al. [16] obtained
4.716 eV for the binding energy of H2 molecule and a very accurate potential curve in the entire range of R. The
corresponding E(R) is shown as a dash line (Patil et al. 2) in Fig. 8. Similar wave functions which take full advantage
of the asymptotic and proximal boundary conditions are useful in variational calculations of larger systems [39].

IV. ANALYTICAL WAVE MECHANICAL SOLUTIONS FOR ONE ELECTRON MOLECULES

From now on throughout the Sections IV, V and VI, unless otherwise noted, we assume the Born–Oppenheimer
separation, where there are N nuclei, containing Zk protons located at RRRk, respectively, for k = 1, 2, . . . , N , and Ne
electrons. Each electron’s coordinates are denoted as rrrj, j = 1, 2, . . . , Ne, where rrrj = (xj , yj, zj). The steady-state
equation, in atomic units, can be written as

Closed-form solutions to (IV.1) are hard to come by in general. What is known today is the following:

Ne = 1, N = 1
Ne = 1, N = 1:
(i) Ne = 1, N = 1
This is the case of hydrogen atom H (or H-like ions with a single nucleus and electron) whose solutions are
known explicitly in closed form, to be brieﬂy reviewed in Subsection IV A.

Ne = 1, N = 2
(ii) Ne = 1, N = 2
Ne = 1, N = 2:
This is the H+

inﬁnite series of products of special functions in prolate spheroidal coordinates, where coeﬃcients of the series

in Subsection IV B.

As a conclusion of this section, we note that the eigenstates of the hydrogen atom given in the preceding subsection
can also be easily represented in terms of the prolate spheroidal coordinates. We let the nucleus of H (i.e., a proton) sit
at location a where (0, 0,
R/2) with Za = 1 while at location b where (0, 0, R/2) we let Zb = 0. Thus, the hydrogen
atom satisﬁes Eq. (IV.13) in the form

C. The many-centered, one-electron problem

When Ne = 1 and N

3 in (IV.1), we have a molecular ion with three or more nuclei sharing one electron.
A simple example is a CO2-like structure, with N = 3. For such a problem, separable closed-form solutions are
extremely diﬃcult to come by from the traditional line of attack. However, we want to describe an elegant analysis
by T. Shibuya and C.E. Wulfman [59] (see also the book by B.R. Judd [63]) which works in momentum space and
expand electron’s eigenfunction as a linear combination of 4-dimensional spherical harmonics. This analysis may oﬀer
useful help to the modeling and computation of complex molecules after proper numerical realization.

The 1-electron one-centered or two-centered orbitals derived in Subsection IV.A and IV.B will be utilized frequently
in the rest of the paper. At the present time, there is very limited knowledge about the 1-electron many-centered
orbitals as discussed in Subsection IV.C. There seems to be abundant space for their exploitation in molecular modeling

V. TWO ELECTRON MOLECULES: CUSP CONDITIONS AND CORRELATION FUNCTIONS

A. The cusp conditions

In the study of any linear partial diﬀerential equations with singular coeﬃcients, it is well known to the theorists
that solutions will have important peculiar behavior at and near the locations of the singularities. We have ﬁrst
encountered such singularities in Subsection III C 1. Here we give singularities of the Coulomb type a more systematic
treatment. The critical mathematical analysis was ﬁrst made by Kato [64] in the form of cusp conditions for the
Born–Oppenheimer separation.

Consider the following slightly more general form of the Schr¨odinger equation for a 2-particle system

The operator ˆH has ﬁve sets of singularities, at

r1a = 0,

r1b = 0,

r2a = 0,

r2b = 0

and r12 = 0.

It has been proved by Kato [64] that the wave function ψ is H¨older continuous, with bounded ﬁrst order partial
derivatives. However, these ﬁrst order partial derivatives ∂ψ/∂xi, etc., i = 1, 2, . . . , 6, are discontinuous at (V.3). In
the terminology of the mathematical theory of partial diﬀerential equations, (V.2) is said to have a nontrivial solution
in the Sobolev space H 1(R6).

We now discuss the cusp conditions at these singularities. What is a cusp condition? It can be simply explained in
the following paragraph. Let us elucidate it for the two particle Hamiltonian (V.2); for a multi-particle Hamiltonian
the idea is the same.

2
1/2m1 and
−∇

In order for the wave function ψ to satisfy the eigenvalue problem (V.1) at the singularities (V.3), the kinetic energy
2
2/2m2, after acting on ψ, must produce terms that exactly cancel those singularity terms
operators
−∇
in the potential in order to give us back just a constant E times ψ, because the wave function ψ is bounded everywhere
in space, including the points where the nuclei are located, without exception. One can see that, if the cusp conditions
are not satisﬁed, then there is some unboundedness at the singularities (V.3) which can aﬀect the accuracy in numerical
computations. Conversely, if the cusp conditions are satisﬁed, this normally improves the numerical accuracy.

In case we don’t know the exact eigenstate, but only a certain trial wave function, say φ, then ( ˆH

E)φ = 0 will

−

not be satisﬁed in general. Rather, we have

for some function f depending on the spatial variables rrr1 and rrr2. However, we can insist on choosing parameters
in φ such that the residual f (rrr1, rrr2) is a bounded function everywhere; in particular, f (rrr1, rrr2) cannot contain any
singularity at (V.3). We say that the trial wave function φ satisﬁes

( ˆH

−

E)φ(rrr1, rrr2) = f (rrr1, rrr2)

(i) the electron-nucleus cusp condition at a (resp. b) if f is not singular at a (resp. b);

(ii) the interelectronic (or electron-electron) cusp condition if f is not singular when r12 = 0.

For example, in the simple case of a hydrogen atom,

let φ(rrr) = Ce−

αr be a trial wave function. Then for any E,

The singularity 1/r can be eliminated only by choosing α = 1. This is the cusp condition, which actually forces φ to
be the ground state (with E =

the origin.

Eqs. (V.4), (V.5) are the electron-nucleus cusp condition, while Eq. (V.6) is the interelectronic condition.

In forming trial wave functions from one-centered or two-centered orbitals for a homonuclear diatomic molecule a

commonly used wave function is

ψ(rrr1, rrr2) = φ(rrr1)φ(rrr2)f (r12),

f (r12) = 1 +

(cf. (I.17))

where φ(rrri), i = 1, 2, is an orbital for the molecular ion. In Appendix F we show that (V.7) satisﬁes the interelectronic
cusp condition. If, however, φ1 6

The actual veriﬁcations of cusp conditions for speciﬁcally given examples of trial wave functions in the cases of
one-centered orbitals or their products are not diﬃcult. But such work is nontrivial when the trial wave functions are
expressed in terms of prolate spheroidal coordinates. In Appendix H we illustrate through concrete examples how to
carry out this task.

B. Various forms of the correlation function f (r12)

We have learned the importance of the interelectronic cusp condition in Section V A. But there are, in addition,
three important constructs that are crucial for diatomic calculations: orbitals, conﬁgurations and electronic correlation.
In this section, we compile a list of often cited correlation functions f which help the satisfaction of the interelectronic
cusp conditions in the context of Eq. (V.6). The study of the other two, i.e., orbitals and conﬁgurations, will be
addressed in the next section.

This is the simplest possible interelectronic conﬁguration function. The speciﬁc form is due to the correlation cusp

This simple f (r12) captures short distance interelectronic interaction very well. It oﬀers elegant representations of
molecular orbitals and great facility to computation. Nevertheless, its asymptotic behavior of linear growth for large
r12 is not physically correct.

When we write molecular orbitals as

ψ(rrr1, rrr2, r12) = φ(rrr1, rrr2)f (r12),

if the function φ(rrr1, rrr2) is already quite small in the region where r12 becomes large compared to 1, then this simple

not be satisfactory for medium values of r12.

VI. MODELING OF DIATOMIC MOLECULES

44

In this section, we give a survey of major existing methods for the numerical modeling of diatomic molecules. These
methods provide approximations of wave functions either in explicit form through properly selected ansatzs, or in
implicit form through iterations as numerical solutions of integro-partial diﬀerential equations.

The methods and ansatzs to be described below are

(1) The Heitler–London method;

(2) The Hund–Mulliken method;

(3) The Hartree–Fock (self-consistent) method;

(4) The James–Coolidge wave function;

(5) Two-centered orbitals;

∼

Items (1)

(3) above historically are associated with one-centered orbitals, while (4)

(5) are based on two-centered
orbitals. But this dichotomy is not inﬂexible. An example is a hybrid type containing both one-centered and two-
centered orbitals considerd in Subsection III.C.6. We now discuss them in sequential order below. Each approach has
a set of modeling parameters which can be optimized through calculus of variations. In particular, we will point out
what these parameters are.

∼

A. The Heitler–London method

This method has the longest history. It was developed by Heitler and London during the 1920s soon after Heisenberg
laid the quantum mechanical foundation of ferromagnetism. The method is usually called the valence-bond (or atomic
orbital) method. In this method, each molecule is thought of as composed of atoms, and the electronic structure is
described using atomic orbitals of these atoms.

Here we present a version of reﬁned Heitler–London approach due to Slater [68]. In the method, electron spin-

orbitals are taken from a determinant

which satisfy the Fermionic property of the Pauli exclusion principle. The orbitals in (VI.1) are called the Slater
orbitals. Let us consider the 2-electron case, i.e., n = 2 in (VI.1). The spin-orbital ui(j), i, j = 1, 2, consists of
(i) the electron-atomic orbital part

usually many times larger than H0, and is largely responsible for the attraction between atoms in forming a molecule.
u state potential energy curves E(R) of the H2 molecule.
When α = 1 the ground state curve yields the binding energy of 0.116 a.u.=3.16 eV; the value must be compared
with 4.748 eV obtained by Kolos and Roothaan [9]. When α (eﬀective charge) is treated as a variational parameter
[70] the calculation yields the binding energy of 0.139 a.u.=3.78 eV and the bond length of 1.41 Bohr radii. For the
3Σ+

u state the eﬀective charge and the α = 1 curves are practically indistinguishable.

B. The Hund–Mulliken method

In 1927, Robert Mulliken worked with Friedrich Hund and developed the Hund–Mulliken molecular orbital theory
in which electrons are assigned to states over an entire molecule. Hund–Mulliken’s molecular orbital method was
more ﬂexible and applicable than the traditional Valence-Bond theory that had previously prevailed. Because of this,
Mulliken received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1966.

The approach has some similarity to the Heitler–London’s, so we can inherit the notation from there. Its special

feature is that a linear combination of the molecular gerade (g) and ungerade (u) states are used:

1Σ+

g : (g+g−) :

For the Hund–Mulliken method discussed above, again α is the variational parameter.

In Fig. 16 we plot the
ground 1Σ+
u state potential energy curves E(R) of the H2 molecule. When α = 1 the ground
state curve yields the binding energy of 0.119 a.u.=3.23 eV. The eﬀective charge calculation yields the binding energy
of 0.148 a.u.=4.03 eV and the bond length of 1.43 Bohr radii. The 3Σ+
u curve is identical to the Heitler–London E(R)
(see Fig. 15).

C. The Hartree–Fock self-consistent method

This is perhaps the best known method in molecular quantum chemistry and it works for multi-electron and multi-
center cases. In computational physics, the Hartree–Fock calculation scheme is a self-consistent iterative procedure
to calculate the optimal single-particle determinant solution to the time-independent Schr¨odinger equation. As a
consequence to this, while it calculates the exchange energy exactly, it does not calculate the eﬀect of electron
correlation at all. The name is for Douglas Hartree, who devised the self consistent ﬁeld method, and Vladimir Fock
who reformulated it into the matrix form used today and introduced the exchange energy.

The starting point for the Hartree–Fock method is a set of approximate orbitals. For an atomic calculation, these
are typically hydrogenic orbitals. For a molecular calculation, the initial approximate wave functions are typically a
linear combination of atomic orbitals. This gives a collections of one electron orbitals, which due to the Fermionic
nature of electrons must be anti-symmetric; the antisymmetry is achieved through the use of a Slater determinant.

Once an initial wave function is constructed, an electron is selected. The eﬀect of all the other electrons is summed
up, and used to generate a potential. This is why the procedure is sometimes called a mean-ﬁeld procedure. This gives
a single electron in a deﬁned potential, for which the Schr¨odinger equation can be solved, giving a slightly diﬀerent
wave function for that electron. This process is then repeated for all the other electrons, which complete one iteration
of the procedure. The whole procedure is then repeated until the self-consistent solution is obtained.

Here we discuss the method in detail. Consider the Hamiltonian of a multi-electron and multi-center molecular
system (with n electrons and N nuclei, respectively) under the Born–Oppenheimer separation in the following form

F , called the Fock operator, involves those unknown MOs (φj (rrr)’s) complicatedly (note that summations in F are
over all occupied orbitals, including φj (rrr) itself); this is not a simple eigenvalue problem. A self-consistent ﬁeld (SCF)
method is needed to solve the Hartree–Fock equation. For that, we take all MOs in F to be known by guessing a set
of MOs and plugging them into F . Then, the Hartree–Fock equation becomes a normal eigenvalue problem. We solve
this problem and compare the resulting MOs (eigenvectors) to those MOs we substitute into F . If they are diﬀerent,
we put these new MOs back to F and do the same calculation again. This is done iteratively until all φj’s converge.
The problem is then how do we guess (or express) those MOs. An often used method is what we called the linear
combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO) method. In this method, we expand the unknown MOs linearly in a ﬁxed
basis set, such as

φi(rrr) =

Cµiχµ(rrr), Cµi ∈

µ
X

C; C is the complex number ﬁeld.

(VI.14)

Here, χµ(rrr) can be any functions deemed appropriately (not required to be orthonormal), and they are often approx-
imations to atomic orbitals with respect to the individual centers. We still refer them as atomic orbitals (AOs) in
the following. By multiplying φ∗i (rrr) on equations (VI.13) and integrating with respect to rrr, we can rewrite those HF
equations (VI.13) as

Fij = εiδij ,

(VI.15)

with

If we then substitute expansions (VI.14) back into the new HF equations (VI.15), we obtain

The whole procedure for the Hartree–Fock Self-consistent Field (HF-SCF) calculation can be summarized as follows:

(1) Choose a basis set

.

χµ}

{

(2) Calculate integrals over this basis set (and store in memory).

(3) Guess the MO coeﬃcients Cµi.

6
51

−

(4) Construct DDD and then FFF .

(5) Solve equations (VI.16) for new Cµi, and iterate until convergence results.

Note here the total electronic energy can be calculated by use of equation (VI.12).

Good choice of the basis set is very important to the HF-SCF method. Otherwise, basis set can fail the whole
calculation, produce bad or wrong results or make calculations become very expensive. A natural choice of the basis
are hydrogenic wave functions, or Slater-type orbitals (STOs)

χST O

l,m = exp(

ζrA)rl

AYlm(θA, φA),

where Ylm are the spherical harmonics and the STO is centered on the nucleus A. This basis set works nicely for
atoms as well as for diatomic molecules (some numerical integrations are required) and linear polyatomics (a large
number of numerical integrations need to be done). No algorithm for nonlinear molecules has been developed till now.
Another basis set is the Gaussian-type orbitals (GTOs). This basis set is proposed by S.F. Boys [71] in the following
form

or in Cartesian form,

χGT O

l,m = exp(

αr2

A)rl

AYlm(θA, φA),

χGT O

l,m = exp(

αr2

A)xl

Aym

A zn
A.

−
This basis set has been widely used since those multicenter integrals in FFF can be easily done [71] over this basis set.
In principle, it works for all molecules. However, there is a trade-oﬀ. GTOs are totally conjectural functions which
have no concrete physical meanings. Because of this, GTOs are seldomly used to form basis sets directly. They are
often used to estimate STOs (by expressing one STO into linear combination of several GTOs) and then form the
basis set, such as the STO-3G (3 GTOs are used to estimate one STO) basis set.

So far we have discussed the HF-SCF method for closed-shell systems. For the open-shell systems, there are
unpaired electrons, orbitals could be doubly occupied or singly occupied. This makes calculations more complicated.
The simplest way to deal with this problem is to treat one doubly occupied orbital as two independent orbitals. For
example, orbitals φi and ¯φi are treated independently and they are not required to have the same spatial part. With
a few modiﬁcations, the closed-shell HF-SCF method can be migrated to this case, which is called the unrestricted
open-shell HF-SCF method. If we do put restrictions on φi and ¯φi requiring them to have the same spatial part, then
we need to treat the doubly occupied and the singly occupied orbitals diﬀerently. Calculations can be done still in a
more complicated way called the restricted open-shell HF-SCF method [72].

Many strategies have been developed to improve the HF-SCF calculations such as introducing unoccupied molecular
orbitals (virtual orbitals), or using two (double-zeta basis set) or three (triple-zeta basis set) STOs to describe one
molecular orbital (note here that STOs could be linear combinations of GTOs).

The HF-SCF method succeeds in many purposes of calculations such as the ground state energy, chemical bond
lengths, angles calculations, etc. It yields 3.636 eV for the binding energy of H2 molecule [9] (to be compared against
the “exact value of 4.745 eV). Nevertheless, this method fails to describe the long distance behavior of a chemical bond
(see Fig. 17). More subtly, the HF method views that each electron interacts with a mean potential ﬁeld generated
by the other electrons. It does not take into account the electron correlation. Researchers have been trying to mend
these by combining other methods, such as the multiconﬁgurational SCF, conﬁguration interaction and interelectronic
correlation terms in their calculations.

¿From homonuclear (such as H2) symmetry considerations, j + k in (VI.17) must be even. But this restriction can be
removed for heteronuclear cases. For given R > 0, the coeﬃcients α, and Cmnjkp for ﬁnitely many indices m, n, j, k

Next, we address the analytic treatment and provide a complete compendium for the integrals given in (VI.17)–

(VI.22), which constitutes the keystone in the two-centered variational treatment.

The model Hamiltonian that we will be using here is the (homonuclear case) H2 as given in (VI.6). Let us rewrite

the James–Coolidge wave function as

We remark that for the heteronuclear case and for excited states, the trial wave function (VI.23)–(VI.24) can be easily
re-adjusted to the form (VI.22) with relative ease.

and ν, m, n, j, k and ℓ are integers (ℓ

Using the above function, we can write every integration in terms of Z ν(m, n, j, k; ℓ). For example, the Coulomb

The James–Coolidge wave functions may be said to have the most “brawny” power as thousands of coeﬃcients
Cmnjkp have been calculated with automated computer programs, yielding very accurate values for the binding energy
of diatomic molecules. Nevertheless, there are certain associated shortcomings:

(i) The physical insights about molecular bonding seem to be lost;

(ii) The wave functions in general do not satisfy the correlation cusp condition;

(iii) For large λ1 and λ2, the asymptotic conditions are violated (see Appendix D).

E. Two-centered orbitals

Historically, the ﬁrst use of two-centered orbitals for molecular calculations is attributable to Wallis and Hulbert’s
paper [41] published in 1954. For a historical summary, see [32, 43]. New push and progress have been made by a
school of French researchers [7, 13, 14, 15, 73, 74] since 1976. Their work has made the two-center orbital approach
to diatomic modeling and computation an admirable success.

The contributions by the French school are manifold, generalizing most of the aspects of one-centered orbitals to
two-centered ones. To introduce its basic elements, let us utilize some of the semi-tutorial material from Scully, et al.
[17].

Recall the correlation diagram for H2 molecule shown in Fig. 18 [17]. A typical form of the trial wave function for

H2, e.g., may be represented as

ψ = [c1

ψH2,1sσ + c2

ψH2,2pσ]f (r12),

where

ψH2,1sσ and

ψH2,2pσ are chosen to be, respectively,

2 r12 and c2 = 0 in (VI.52), the
choice of (VI.55) yields the binding energy EB = 0.1710 a.u.= 4.653 eV for H2. The choice f (r12) = 1 + κr12,
where κ is a variational parameter, slightly improves the answer and gives EB = 0.1713 a.u.= 4.661 eV.

(c) for correlated orbitals with conﬁguration interaction, i.e., f (r12) = 1 + 1

eV. For the correlation factor f (r12) with the variational parameter κ we obtain EB = 0.1721 a.u.= 4.682 eV.

What is quite striking here is that if, instead of (VI.55), we choose a ﬁner two-centered orbital

able to capture the essence of chemical bonding of H2 with very good accuracy.

For a heteronuclear molecule such as HeH+, a simple adaptation of the above scheme works equally well. Never-
theless, the authors have found that for large R, more terms involving both λ and µ variables should be included in
(VI.55), such as

(2) Generalized correlated or uncorrelated two-centered wave functions

The two-centered orbitals we have been using in this section to build up the molecular orbitals, whether they
be correlated, uncorrelated, with or without conﬁguration interaction, have been heavily inﬂuenced by the classic
solutions due to Hylleraas and Jaﬀ´e, cf. (IV.30) and (IV.26). These two famous solutions were derived during the
1920s and 1930s with great ingenuity, their greatest advantages being that a 3-term recurrent relation of the series
coeﬃcients. The 3-term recurrences further lead to continued fractions which have enabled mathematicians to perform
asymptotic analysis. That was during a time when no electronic computers were available and it was perhaps the
only way to perform any theoretical analysis at all. Nowadays, fast computers are readily available so we don’t have
to rely overly on 3-term recurrence relations. Five-term recurrence relations are just as good and can be treated with
relative ease also by the Killingbeck algorithm [75], for example.

The two-centered orbitals derived above diﬀer from those of Hylleraas and Jaﬀ´e. The ansatz (VI.80) is not the only
way to obtain two-centered orbitals. It is possible to derive several other solutions in diﬀerent forms using diﬀerent
orthogonal polynomials. Numerical results indicate that these two-centered orbitals here give accuracy compatible to
that corresponding to Hylleraas and Jaﬀ´e type solutions.

(3) Numerical algorithm

In contrast to the explicit analytic formulas for the quadratures of James–Coolidge wave functions given in VI.D
and in the aﬃliated Appendices J and K, here the integrals will be computed using the Gaussian quadrature routines.
(The analytic formulas given earlier in VI.D can then be compared with those obtained here as a good check.) For
the two-electron problem, the number of coordinates are six, so that the energy calculation requires the 6-dimensional
integration. Using the cylindrical symmetry, we can reduce two angular variables to one.

The next simpliﬁcation is the choice of the wave functions.

If we only restrict the wave functions to be the
James–Coolidge type, the 5-dimensional integration can be divided as one two-dimensional integration and two three-
κr12, this
dimensional integration. However, if we include the exponential function of inter-electron distance, that is e−

5-dimensional integration should be evaluated as multidimensional integration, and the numerical accuracy should be
carefully investigated.

Here, we only restrict the wave functions to be the James–Coolidge type. The usual integration has the following

form.

Using the r2
12-identity, cf. (VI.31), the exponent of r12 can be reduced into 0 or -1. For n = 0, the whole integration
is divided into only 5 one-dimensional integrations. However, for 1/r12, by the Neumann expansion the form of wave
function includes sum of Legendre Polynomials with proper coeﬃcients; cf. (VI.39). Especially, the form of the λ-part
is

This makes the form of integration over the λ variable as

The implementation of these numerical integration is automated by standard computer software. Let us describe

the numerics for a homonuclear dimer H2 molecule and a heteronuclear dimer HeH+ molecular ion.

The approximation of wave function of two-electron system into a multiplication of one-electron system can be

easily made in the natural orbit expansion

Ψ(r1, r2) =

ckχk(r1)χk(r2)

where χk(r1) is the wave function of one-electron two-center problem.

For the ground state, it’s well-known that c1 ∼

1, or

Ψ(r1, r2)

χ1(r1)χ1(r2).

X

There are a few alternatives to approximate the χ1(r1). One is using the exact solution of one-electron two-center

problem, 1sσg state. The Jaﬀe’s form is

cf. (IV.26).

And the other is Patil’s wave function

χ1(r1) = (1 + bλ)βe−

αP λ cosh(aµ);

cf. (VI.59).

We may also include conﬁguration interaction, such as

Ψ(r1, r2) = c1χ1(r1)χ1(r2) + c2χ2(r1)χ2(r2)

where χ1 is 1sσg state and χ2 is 2pσu state.

The result is shown in Fig. 19. Before the diagonalization (that is, CI), the asymptotic behavior of the ground state
E(R) is monotonically increasing. By diagonalizing, the behavior at large R becomes almost ﬂat, however, E(R) is
slightly above the exact asymptotic value, -1 (htr).

Next, we perform computations with correlation by using f (r12) = 1 + 1

2 r12. Improvement can be readily seen in

Fig. 20 which is much closer to the exact calculation done by Kolos [9].
In the calculations below (Figs. 19 and 20), “exact” solutions of H+

2 -solutions were used (whose coeﬃcients are
obtained through truncated Killingbeck [75] procedures). Instead, one can use (VI.55), (VI.56), (VI.57) by optimizing
the coeﬃcients α and B therein, or, for the Patil’s wave function, by optimizing the coeﬃcients a and β in (VI.59)
and (VI.60). By doing so, we obtain the energy curve of the ground state as shown in Figs. 21 and 22, respectively.
The energy curves are improved over a wide range of R values, and we obtain the binding energy of 0.171 a.u.= 4.65
eV, close to the experimental value. However, E(R) in Fig. 21 overshoots the dissociation limit.

VII. ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES

A.

Improvement of Hartree–Fock results using the Bohr model

The Bohr model can also be applied to calculate the correlation energy for molecules and then improve the HF
treatment. Fig. 23 shows the ground state potential curve for H2 molecule calculated in the Bohr-HF approximation.
Such an approximation omits the electron repulsion term 1/r12 in ﬁnding the electron conﬁguration from Eq. (I.2).
The diﬀerence between the Bohr and Bohr-HF potential curves yields the correlation energy plotted in the insert of
Fig. 23.

B. Dimensional scaling

Dimensional scaling oﬀers promising new computational strategies for the study of few electron systems. This is
exempliﬁed by recent applications to atoms, as well as H+
2 and H2 molecules [4, 11]. D-scaling emulates a standard
method of quantum chromodynamics [10], by generalizing the Schr¨odinger equation to D dimensions and rescaling
coordinates [11]. The D
limit corresponds to inﬁnitely heavy electrons and reduces to a classic electrostatic
problem of ﬁnding an electron conﬁguration that minimizes a known eﬀective potential.

We start from the Schr¨odinger equation ˆHΨ = EΨ for a two particle wave function Ψ(r1, r2). The H2 Hamiltonian

→ ∞

in atomic units reads

ˆH =

1

1 −
2 ∇

1
2
2 + V (ρ1, ρ2, z1, z2, φ, R),
2 ∇

−

where the Coulomb potential energy V is given by Eq.
In a traditional dimensional scaling approach the
Laplacian is treated in D-dimension and the wave function is transformed by incorporating the square root of the
3 in cylindrical coordinates, and φ is the dihedral angle
Jacobian via Ψ
−
specifying relative azimuthal orientation of electrons about the molecular axis [76]. D-scaling in spherical coordinates
is discussed in Appendix M. On scaling the coordinates by f 2 and the energy by 1/f 2, with f = (D
1)/2, the
Schr¨odinger equation in the limit D

leads to minimization of the eﬀective potential [76]

The obtained electron conﬁguration is sometimes called the Lewis structure because it provides a rigorous version
of the familiar electron-dot formulas introduced by Lewis in 1916 [77]. Fig. 25 (upper curve) displays the D

potential curve E(R) that exhibits no binding and substantially deviates from the D = 3 “exact” energy (dots). In
the limit D

The interpolated D = 3 curve exhibits binding which indicates the feasibility of extending dimensional interpolation
to molecules.

A proper choice of scaling can improve the method. Here we discuss a dimensional scaling transformation of
the Schr¨odinger equation that yields the Bohr model of H2 in the limit of inﬁnite dimensionality [4]. For such
a transformation, the large-D limit provides a link between the old (Bohr-Sommerfeld) and the new (Heisenberg-
Schr¨odinger) quantum mechanics. The ﬁrst-order correction in 1/D substantially improves the agreement with the
exact ground state E(R).

In the modiﬁed scaling the Laplacian depends on a continuous parameter D as follows

limit for the H2 molecule [76]. Here, in order to connect with the Bohr model, it is necessary to incorporate
only the radial portion of the Jacobian in transforming the electronic wave function via Eq. (VII.5). The customary
practice, which employs the full Jacobian, introduces a factor of 1/(sin2 φ) into the centrifugal potential, as seen from
Eq. (VII.1). The modiﬁed procedure yields directly a good zeroth-order approximation.

The ground state E(R) can be substantially improved by use of a perturbation expansion in powers of 1/D,
developed by expanding the eﬀective potential of Eq. (VII.8) in powers of the displacement from the minimum [11];
for He and H+
2 this has yielded highly accurate results [80]. Terms quadratic in the displacement describe harmonic
oscillations about the minimum and give a 1/D correction to the energy. Anharmonic cubic and quartic terms give a
1/D2 contribution. For the He ground state energy (the R = 0 limit for H2) a ﬁrst-order approximation yields [4, 81]

(cid:19)
is the Bohr model He result [6, 82]. For D = 3 Eq. (VII.9) improves the ground state

−

2.906 a.u., which diﬀers by 0.07% only from the “exact” value of

2.9037 a.u. [83].

The eﬀective potential of Eq. (VII.8) then has a minimum at ρ1 = ρ2 = ρ0, φ = π, ˜z2 = 0. Along the coordinates ρ1,
ρ2, ˜z2 and φ the potential has a single well structure no matter what the internuclear spacing R is. However, along
the ˜z1 direction at R = 1.2 the potential changes shape from a single to a double well; such symmetry breaking is a
typical feature exhibited at large D [84]. To avoid the inaccuracy of approximation by a single quadratic form one
can solve the Schr¨odinger equation numerically along the ˜z1 direction for the exact potential and add contributions
from the harmonic motion associated with the other coordinates ρ1, ρ2, ˜z2 and φ. The result is shown in Fig. 26
[4]. The 1/D correction improves E(R) and predicts the equilibrium separation to be Re = 1.62 with binding energy
EB = 4.38 eV.

VIII. CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK

Many major topics on diatomic molecules, and some other atoms and molecules in general, have been addressed
in this article, giving it a very “locally diverse” or perhaps a somewhat disjoint look. But a simple, “global” picture
may be viewed and understood in/from the following diagram:

old Bohr(−Sommerfeld)
quasi−quantum−mechanical model:
properties, new progress and refinement
(Chapters 1 and 2)

..

new Schrodinger(−Born−Oppenheimer)
fully−quantum−mechanical model:

asymptotics, theoretical and numerical
methods: Chapters 3, 4, 5 and 6

69

"Unification" through D−scaling,
and further (Bohr−Hartree−Fock)
refinement: Chapter 7

This “uniﬁcation” is by no means an easy task. Nevertheless, it was a goal we somehow envisioned to achieve when
this research was started and we hope we have made at least some success.

At present, in the study of ultrafast laser applications to chemical physics and molecular chemistry problems, there
is a pressing need to understand the quantum-dynamical behavior of molecules and the associated properties of excited
states and their computations. Many challenges are lying ahead and awaiting elegant solutions.

When m = 0, the case of the ground state, the above expansion in terms of powers of λ is consistent with the terms

(D.3) is no longer consistent with those in (D.4) as far as the λ-variable is concerned because the factor (λ

factor (λ

The discussion in this section points out some weaknesses in the choice of basis functions (D.1) or (D.2) based on

Our conclusion for this subsection is: because of the vastly diﬀerent asymptotic behaviors of Λ(λ) for λ
1, the best strategy for numerical computation is to use two diﬀerent representations for Λ(λ), one for λ

1 and
1 and

PROLATE SPHEROIDAL COORDINATES

In the work of Patil (see Eq. (2.15) in [57]), he indicated that for the ground state ψ (i.e., with azimuth quantum

number m = 0) for the molecular ion with Hamiltonian

the “coelescense” condition at rb = 0 can be expressed as

Actually, at least two ways are viable, which are going to be described below through some concrete examples.
The ﬁrst way takes a limiting approach in a similar spirit as Patil’s (H.2). The second way utilizes an explicit
representation.
Example H.1. For the Hamiltonian (H.1), motivated by the Jaﬀ´e solution (IV.26), let us consider a trial wave function
for the ground state:

ψ(λ, µ) = e−

αλ[1 + B2P2(µ)].

(H.3)

We want to consider the cusp condition in terms of the undetermined coeﬃcients α and B2 in (H.3).
Recall from (A.3) that

0 is equivalent to λ

These are the cusp conditions at ra = 0 and rb = 0.

However, we need to remark that F1(1,

1) = 0 and G1(1, 1) = 0 are only necessary conditions for the desired
boundedness because the limits in (H.6) and (H.7) do not exist in general as λ and µ may be related in inﬁnitely
many diﬀerent ways to yield totally diﬀerent limits as λ
1. Thus, the above estimation approach has
→
an ad hoc nature. Nevertheless, (H.8) and (H.9) do provide correct answers as to be cross-validiﬁed with (H.16) and
(H.17) in Example H.2.

−

In inspecting (H.8) and (H.9), we see that they are consistent when and only when Za = Zb, i.e., the homonuclear
case. Therefore, (H.3) would not be a good choice of a trial wave function in the heteronuclear case. For the
heteronuclear case, taking hints from the exact solutions (IV.30) and (IV.35), we choose the trial wave function

Here, α may be diﬀerent to β even though the exact solution says α = β. We have

APPENDIX J: DERIVATIONS RELATED TO THE LAPLACIAN FOR SUBSECTION VI.D

Evaluation of the Laplacian in the prolate spheroidal coordinates for the general form of the wave function which
includes electron-electron correlations explicitly is a demanding task. Here we provide the details of the calculations.

The general form of each term in the wave function is

Φs(1, 2) =

Φs(1)Φs(2)Ps(r12)

Φs(1) = Fs(λ1)Gs(µ1)

Φs(2) = ˜Fs(λ2) ˜Ms(µ2).

Abstract

We present a simple model for chiral molecules which yields the frequency-dependent
multipole-multipole polarizabilities required for calculating the dispersive van der
Waals constants in a simple, closed, and consistent form. The model consists of a
single eﬀective charge conﬁned to a one-dimensional wire formed by two circular
arcs, which are twisted with respect to each other by an angle characterizing the
chirality. The resulting polarizabilities show a simple functional dependence on the
model parameters, and they serve to mimic the chiral properties of small molecules,
such as H2S2, in a reasonably realistic way.

Key words: chiral molecule, twisted wire model, multipole-multipole polarizability

1 Introduction

Wire models [1,2] are popular to describe molecular conﬁgurations where elec-
trons are allowed to move almost freely along quasi one-dimensional structures,
as is the case e.g. with the dislocated π-electrons in organic chain molecules
[3,4,5]. Studies comparing these models with ab-initio electronic conﬁguration
calculations [2,6] show that, in spite of their simplicity, these models succeed
in reproducing many qualitative features and yield even quantitatively rea-
sonable results.

In the present article we discuss a simple wire model which aims at describing
small chiral molecules, and in particular the dependence of the chiral nature
on their electronic susceptibilities. The latter determine important molecular
properties such as the optical activity and the dispersion forces acting between
molecules. While the chiroptical properties have already been subject of several
publications [1,2,3,4,5], the present article is focused on the dispersion forces.

In general, it is a diﬃcult task to calculate the dispersive interaction poten-
tial strengths between chiral molecules (with few or no symmetries) and other
polarizable particles if one has to go beyond the bulk van-der-Waals force
C6/r6. This is the case, e.g. if one needs to assess the relative strength
U =
of chirality-discriminative part of the interaction versus the non-discriminative
ones. The reason is that multipole-multipole polarizabilities are required on
the whole imaginary frequency spectrum for calculating the higher order dis-
persion constants which are linear combinations of integrals [7]

denote the polarizabilities for molecules A and B,

A = ℓB = ℓ′

The van-der-Waals dispersion constant C6 depends on the electric-dipole-
electric-dipole polarizabilities of both molecules (ℓA = ℓ′
B = 1).
While it does not discriminate between the left- and right-handed conﬁgu-
rations of an oriented chiral molecule, higher order dispersion interactions
diﬀer in general for left and right conﬁgurations. Often, a rotational average
over all orientations of the chiral molecule cancels this left-right distinction in
the cross sections. However, consider a coherent superposition of the left- and
right-handed conﬁguration states [8], which will be subject to decoherence due
to collisions with the atoms of a surrounding gas. In this case, the decoherence
process is determined by collisions of spherical gas atoms B oﬀ the oriented
chiral molecule A. Here, the lowest order discriminative interaction with B
(ℓB = ℓ′
B = 1) is given by the electric-dipole-electric-quadrupole polarizability
[9], ℓA = 1 and ℓ′
A = 2. The resulting dispersive interaction depends on the
distance r between the molecules as r−7 [10]. We will focus on this dominant
discriminative interaction below, motivated by the above-mentioned question
of collisional decoherence. We note that there might be additional forces of
comparable strength which do not discriminate left and right, and that only
non-retarded forces are considered in the following. For a discussion of retarded
interaction between chiral molecules, see [11,12,13].

The main aim of the present model is therefore to provide a minimalist, while
consistent and trustworthy model for the bulk electronic properties of chi-
ral molecules. In particular, we give explicit and closed results for the rota-
tory power, the electric-dipole-electric-dipole polarizability, and the electric-
dipole-electric-quadrupole polarizability, both at imaginary frequencies. The
simplicity of the model even admits the calculation of further higher multipole-
multipole polarizabilities with small eﬀort.

The model is speciﬁed by two parameters, the length L determining the bulk
polarizability and the twist angle χ, which corresponds to the dihedral angle
in a molecule, see Fig. 1. By choosing the parameters to represent the chiral di-

2

hydrogen disulﬁde, H2S2, we obtain reasonable values for its various electronic
properties, suggesting that the model may serve as a good approximation for
a typical small chiral molecule. Yet, the aim here is of course not to reproduce
precise numbers, but to have an easily accessible, consistent and plausible de-
scription of the dependence of the electronic susceptibilities on the molecular
parameters, and in particular on the dihedral angle.

The structure of the article is as follows. Sect. 2 presents the model and its
quantization based on the canonical description of the one-dimensional dynam-
ics. The explicit forms of the most important Cartesian operators (position,
momentum, magnetic dipole, and electric quadrupole moment) are then de-
rived in Sect. 3, together with closed expressions for their matrix elements in
the energy eigenbasis. Based on these results the rotatory strength is calculated
in Sect. 4, as a function of the chiral angle. Sect. 5 contains the calculation
and discussion of the electric-dipole-electric-dipole and electric-dipole-electric-
quadrupole polarizability for imaginary frequencies. An example for interac-
tion strengths derived from the polarizabilities is discussed in Sect. 6 and we
present our conclusions in Sect. 7.

2 The twisted arc model

Our model aims at describing the excitation properties of a chiral quantum
system in the easiest possible way. It is formed by two connected circular arcs,
CII, each described by the common radius R and an angle of 90◦. The

total length of the wire is thus L = πR. We put the origin of the coordinate
CI lies in the xy-plane. For χ = 0

at both ends, but there is no force in the x-direction at the joint of
CII.
The model shows C2 symmetry. The symmetry axis (dashed line in Fig. 2) lies
in the yz-plane and includes the origin. It has an angle of
χ/2 with respect
to the z-axis.

We note that an alternative construction, suggested in [5], would be to take (at
least) three straight wire parts joint together at angles of 90◦. We prefer the
present cornerless structure, since it consists only of two equivalent legs which
mirror the symmetry of the wave function, and admit simple closed expressions
for the relevant matrix elements, see below. For a critical examination of the

molecules is the helical thin wire model [15], which however does not allow
the straightforward modelling of the dihedral angle of H2S2.

2.1 Quantization of the twisted arc

In order to quantize the motion let us ﬁrst consider the canonical description
of the classical motion [1]. The natural generalized coordinate is the length of
the wire s (0 6 s 6 L). Noting R = L/π we ﬁnd from Fig. 2 its relation to
the Cartesian coordinates.

3 The Cartesian operators

The functional dependence of the Cartesian operators on the coordinate s will
in general be diﬀerent on
CII. It is therefore convenient to introduce for
any operator A the corresponding partial operators A(I) and A(II) satisfying

3.2 The momentum operator

The Cartesian components of the momentum operator on the individual arcs
can be obtained for the corresponding classical expressions (4). However, un-
like the full operator p, the hermiticity of p(I) and p(II) is not guaranteed.

By replacing the canonical momentum ps in the symmetrized version of (4)
by its corresponding operator (5), and carrying out the derivatives as far as
possible, we get the Cartesian momentum operators

which might be useful as a ﬁtting parameter.

The magnetic dipole moment depends on the origin, and it is natural to choose
the position of the joint between the two arcs in the present model. It can be
easily seen that the non-hermiticity of the parts p(I)
is then irrelevant
since the x-component of the momentum is multiplied by y or z, which vanish
at s = L/2 and thus suppress the hermiticity terms in Eqs. (20) and (21). The
ability to evaluate the magnetic moment directly, without having to resort to
hermitian corrections, is another advantage of the present model.

4 The rotatory strength

We proceed with the discussion of the rotatory strength, the most prominent
property of chiral molecules. We do so to demonstrate the ability of the twisted
arc model to display electromagnetic properties of real, chiral molecules. The
latter are usually optically active, and their chiroptical properties depend on
the optical rotatory tensor [17],

We note also that the rotatory strength does not depend on the choice of
origin. The most convenient choice of origin is therefore the joint of the arcs,
since hermiticity corrections of the momentum operator are then not required,
as discussed above. Note that an object independent of the origin is obtained
by amending the rotatory tensor (34) with additional terms depending on the
quadrupole-dipole tensor, which however cancel out after rotational averaging
[18].

As one expects, the rotatory strength is antisymmetric with respect to the

of 5 to 10 compared with theoretical values for H2S2 [16,19]. This is mainly
due to cancellation eﬀects generated by the two lowest lying excited states
of H2S2, which are nearly degenerated for dihedral angles around π/2. They
have rotatory strengths which are similar in absolute values but opposite in
sign [16].

Having found reasonable choices for the parameters L and Zeﬀ, we now proceed
to evaluate the frequency dependent rotatory power G′ (ω), a further quantity
which permits a comparison with the literature values of the real molecule
H2S2. The rotatory power is expressed by the electric-dipole-magnetic-dipole
polarizability [20],

We will not evaluate the expression further since we are mainly concerned

5 Electric multipole-multipole polarizabilities

We proceed to calculate the electric multipole-multipole polarizability tensor
required for evaluating the dispersion interaction coeﬃcients, C6 and C7. With
this application in mind, the results will not be presented in full generality, but
will be conﬁned to the ground state polarizability at imaginary frequencies.

5.1 General form of the electric-dipole-electric-dipole polarizability tensor

Apart from αxx, all elements of the polarizability tensor α depend on the twist
angle χ. We start by discussing this dependence in more detail, noting that
the elements of the polarization tensor of the state m are given as [20]

three functions,

The dependence on the twist angle is particularly simple in (49) due to the
proportionality relations (12). One observes that only the oﬀ-diagonal elements
in the third row and the third column change their sign when switching to
χ. Such a change of sign in χ is equivalent to a
opposite handedness, χ
z. After an additional rotation by π around
reﬂection at the xy-plane, z
the z-axis a full parity operation, ~r
~r, is obtained. Hence, one gets the
χ conﬁguration after rotating the polarizability tensor of the
tensor of the
+χ conﬁguration, which illustrates the well known fact that all dispersive
interactions solely derived from the electric-dipole-electric-dipole polarizability
tensor do not discriminate left- and right-handed enantiomers.

5.2 Choice of parameters

In the following we present numerical results for a speciﬁc choice of parameters,
which are adapted to mimic the literature values for H2S2, e.g. [16,19]. First we
ﬁx the length parameter L by the sum of the binding lengths of the molecule
which is found to be 8.6 a0. The twist angle in the wire model is chosen to be
π
χ =
2 which is a good approximation of the dihedral angle in the molecule.

±

To ﬁx the eﬀective charge Zeﬀ we consider the static (i.e., ω = 0) values
10−4 au,
for the electric-dipole-electric-dipole polarizability g+ (0) = 1.963
10−3 au. The values of g+ and
g− (0) = 1.218
g− as function of ω are depicted in Fig. 3. A comparison with the Lorentzian
Z 2
eﬀL4a (ω) from (48), which has a width of 3 and a strength of 84.2, shows
that the latter dominates the polarizability tensor.

5.3 Electric-dipole-electric-quadrupole polarizability

The dominant discriminative dispersion interaction between an oriented chi-
ral and an achiral atom or molecule depends on the electric-dipole-electric-
quadrupole polarizability tensor [9]. In addition to the dipole matrix elements,
it is determined by the matrix elements quadratic in the coordinate operators,
n

, discussed in Sect. 3.4.

The required matrix elements can be found in (17) and (33). Obviously, the
polarizability α1,2
k,k′ transforms under parity operation like a product of three
coordinates, rirjrl, which results in an overall negative sign. Thus, the disper-
sive interaction derived from it discriminates left-handed and right-handed
molecules. Finally, it should be noted that the electric-dipole-electric-dipole
polarizability α1,1 does not depend on the choice of the origin, while the
electric-quadrupole-electric-dipole polarizability α2,1 does [10].

6 Potential strengths

As an illustration for the use of the polarizability tensors, let us evaluate the
interaction potential between a helium atom in ground state and the twisted
arc. Its calculation requires the electric-dipole-electric-dipole polarizability of
helium. Since helium is spherically symmetric only a single element of the
spherical polarizability tensor does not vanish, namely α1,1
0,0. For our purposes

18

it suﬃces to approximate the helium polarizability by

α1,1

(54)

with g = 2 and ωHe ≈
frequencies well below the excitation energy [22].

After evaluating the integrals (1) the dispersion potentials can be calculated
following the theory in [23] by disregarding retardation eﬀects. They assume
the form

U6 (~r) =

C6 (ˆr)
r6

−

and

U7 (~r) =

(55)

C7 (ˆr)
r7

−

with ~r the distance vector between helium atom and the center of mass, and
ˆr = ~r/r. For simplicity, we take the center of mass to lie in the origin. The
potential strength C6 (ˆr) is calculated using the spherical dipole-dipole polar-
izability tensor, α1,1
kk′, of the twisted wire model which is readily obtained from
the Cartesian polarizability (49). The calculation of C7 (ˆr) uses the dipole-
quadrupole tensor (53).

To compare the interaction potentials we consider the surface of equality,

C7 (ˆr)
C6 (ˆr)

req (ˆr) = |
|
Thus, at distances r = ξreq the strengths of the potentials are related by
U7|
U6|
. Since the potential strengths are linear combinations of the
|
polarizabilities req (ˆr) is proportional to L. At the same time, the dependence
on Zeﬀ cancels out.

π/2 at L = 8.6a0.
Here, the direction of the helium atom, ˆr = (θ, ϕ), is speciﬁed with respect
to the symmetry axis of the twisted wire (the dashed line in Fig. 2). The
azimuthal angle (with respect to the x-axis) is chosen to be ϕ = π/2. Negative
values of C7/C6 indicate that U7 (~r) is repulsive. As can be seen, the achiral
cis-conﬁguration χ = π is anti-symmetric with respect to θ = π/2 (dash-
dotted line). This is the case for all ϕ, and it is a consequence of the additional
reﬂection symmetry for a planar conﬁguration. For the other achiral situation,
χ = 0 (the trans-conﬁguration), the potential strength C7 vanishes identically,
C7 = 0. For all pairs of left- and right-handed conﬁgurations, χ
= 0, π, the
surfaces of equality cannot be transformed into each other by a proper rotation.
Thus, unlike U6, the U7 interaction does distinguish between right- and left-
handed form, the diﬀerence depending on both the distance r = ξreq, and the
orientation ˆr.

Fig. 4. The relative strength of the discriminative potential C7 (ˆr) compared to the
dipole-dipole potential C6 (ˆr) in Bohr radii as a function of the polar angle θ (see
text). The azimuthal angle is chosen to be ϕ = π
2 and the values of the three diﬀerent
twist angles χ are indicated in the ﬁgure.

We described a minimalist model for chiral molecules, which, in spite of its
simplicity, admits a physically plausible and consistent description of their
chiral properties. As a big advantage of this twisted arc model, the evaluation
of higher order electric moments can be reduced to a small number of simple
functions given in closed form. This way the functional dependence of the mul-
tipole polarizabilities on the frequency and on the model parameters shows
up transparently. The derived chiral properties, such as the rotatory strength
and the dispersive interaction potentials, thus display a simple, while physi-
cally consistent dependence on the model parameters. This was demonstrated,
speciﬁcally for the dihedral angle, by evaluating the chirality-distinguishing
part of the dispersive interaction with a polarizable atom for molecular pa-
rameters adopted to the dihydrogen disulﬁde molecule. The comparison with
the dominant bulk interaction thus permits to assess to what degree right-
and left-handed, oriented molecules can be distinguished by the dispersion
interaction.

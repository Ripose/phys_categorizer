Core excitation from terminal oxygen in O3 is shown to be localized to one of the two equiva-
lent chemical bonds. We demonstrate this with the Auger Doppler eﬀect which is observable when
1 state. Auger electrons emitted from the
O3 is core-excited to the highly dissociative OT 1s
atomic oxygen fragment carry information about the molecular orientation relative to the electro-
magnetic ﬁeld vector at the moment of excitation. The data together with analytical functions for
the electron-peak proﬁles give clear evidence that the preferred molecular orientation only depends
on the orientation of one bond, not on the complete molecular orientation. This is interpreted as a
localized excitation and it is, to the best of our knowledge, the ﬁrst experimental proof for the local-
ization of a core excitation. The widely used assumption of localized core excitation in adsorbates
and large molecules gets hereby experimentally justiﬁed.

INTRODUCTION

Core-valence interactions in large molecules are often
assumed to be limited to the core-excited atom, even if
the atom is one out of several symmetry-equivalent atoms
and their atomic orbitals combine to form molecular or-
bitals, which are delocalized. On the other hand, core-
excitation in small molecules is treated as delocalized.
At which geometrical distance between the symmetry-
equivalent bonds is the delocalized picture of the excita-
tion not valid anymore? We present O3 as a molecule
where core-excitation cannot be regarded as delocalized
but instead is localized to one of the two symmetrically
equivalent bonds. Which of the bonds is participating in
the excitation is only given as a probability, determined

by the orientation of the bonds relative to the lectric vec-
tor of the exciting radiation.

In the present analysis of resonant Auger electron
(RAE) data of O3 we ﬁnd that the core excitation
is localized to one of the symmetry-equivalent bonds
between the terminal oxygen atoms (OT ) and the central
oxygen atom (OC ). We suggest that the photoexication
breaks the symmetry of the molecule and eﬀectively lo-
calizes the excitation to one bond. The large interatomic
symmetry-equivalent oxygen
distance between the
atoms is responsible for the symmetry break being
possible. The results bridge the gap between the case
of small molecules with measurably delocalized excita-
tion and large molecules with apriori localized excitation.

Core excited O3 has been studied both with ion and
electron spectroscopy [1, 2, 3]. The core-excited state
OT 1s−17a1
1 has been shown to be ultra-fast dissociating
[2]. Ultra-fast dissociating molecules dissociate on the
same time scale as the electronic Auger decay, which is
in the femtosecond range. We take advantage of this
characteristic to obtain information about the preferred
molecular orientation relative to the electric light vector
(e-vector) for core excitation. The RAE signal from
the molecules that dissociate before they undergo RAE
decay (≈ 10 %) is an atomic RAE signal. The atomic
Auger electrons obtain additional momentum from the
emitting fragment as a consequence of the preceding
dissociation. This additional momentum is detected as
a shift in energy in the RAE spectrum and can be used
to determine the dissociation direction of the fragment.
Since we study a two-body dissociation this direction
gives full information about the molecular orientation
before dissociation. The molecular orientation before dis-
sociation is to a very good approximation identical to the
orientation during excitation since rotation is an order
of magnitude slower than the Auger decay. Hence, the
RAE spectrum from the fragment contains information
about the molecular orientation at the time of excitation.

II. EXPERIMENT

The experimental data were published in [2]. The
core-excited state investigated was the OT 1s−17a1
1 at
535.85 eV above ground state energy. In literature the
resonance is often designated as “σ∗” resonance. The
experiments were performed at the undulator beam line
I411 [4] at the MAX II storage ring of the Swedish Na-
tional Synchrotron Laboratory in Lund, Sweden. The
RAE spectra were measured with a photon energy reso-
lution of 120 meV and an electron spectrometer resolu-
tion of 140(10) meV. The ozone sample was generated in
a commercial ozone generator (Ozone Technology, Swe-
den) by discharging oxygen (O2) of industrial quality in
an electric ﬁeld. The O2/O3 mixture was then distilled
to a purity of ≈ 99 %. For further experimental details,
see the original experimental paper.

The O3 molecule belongs to the symmetry group
C2ν with four irreducible representations for electron
orbitals: a1, a2, b1 and b2. To be consistent with the
nomenclature in the original experimental paper we
deﬁne the molecule lying in the yz-plane. The OT 1s
atomic core orbitals combine gerade to form the molec-
ular orbital (MO) 2a1 and ungerade to form 1b2. The
transition to the unoccupied 7a1 MO is dipole-allowed
from both the 2a1 and the 1b2 core MOs. Thus, the
transition to the OT 1s−17a1
1 core-excited state is actually
two transitions from the two nearly-degenerate OT core
MOs. The symmetry of the transitions are a1 and b2,
respectively.

III. FUNCTIONS FOR ELECTRON-PEAK
PROFILES

To investigate how localized and delocalized descrip-
tions of the core excitation in O3 lead to experimentally
observable diﬀerences, we derived analytical functions for
peak proﬁles of electron spectra for diﬀerent transition

2

symmetries. The premisses for the two diﬀerent mod-
els, the localized and the delocalized, are summarized in
Fig. 2.

We will start with the derivation for the case of a di-
atomic molecule which is the simplest case and the result
will be of use later. We simplify the derivation by align-
ing the detection axis and the e-vector, as is the case
in most experimental set-ups (for the angle deﬁnitions,
see Fig. 1). The angular distribution for photoexcita-
tion, f (θ), about the polarization of the exciting radia-
tion (e-vector) (for a one-photon excitation in the dipole-
approximation) is given by [5]:

f (θ) =

(1 + βP2(cosθ))

(1)

1
4π

where θ is the angle between the molecular symmetry
axis and the e-vector, β is the anisotropy parameter and
P2(cosθ) = 1
2 (3cos2θ − 1) is the Legendre polynomial of
order 2. The spatial anisotropy parameter β can range
from +2 for a pure parallel transition to −1 for a pure
perpendicular transition. It is assumed that the dissoci-
ation is rapid compared to the rotational period of the
molecule (axial-recoil approximation). Therefore, a mea-
surement of β provides information about the symmetry
of the transition.

In order to obtain a theoretical electron proﬁle for a
two-body dissociation following a transition with a cer-
tain β parameter, we need to integrate the angular dis-
tribution over all angles, since we describe a sample of
randomly oriented molecules. The extra fragment mo-
mentum from dissociation is transferred to the electron.
The measurement determines the projection cos θ of the
momentum along the detection axis. With the e-vector
and the detection axis aligned, the integral over an in-
ﬁnitesimal interval δ θ becomes:

This is diﬀerent from the electron-peak proﬁles derived
in [6], since the latter contain an invalid geometric fac-
tor. The electron proﬁles for the σ transition is shown in
Fig. 3.

For the details of the derivation of the electron-peak
proﬁles for bent molecules of C2ν symmetry we refer to
Appendix A. Here we only give the ﬁnal result for the
sum of the two transitions a1 and b2:

IV. RESULTS

We now compare the experimental data with the ana-
lytically derived proﬁles Eqns. 6 and 7. A fragment Auger
electron peak following OT 1s−17a1
1 excitation [2] is shown
in Fig. 4. The analysis of the other fragment peaks is
analogous and leads to the same conclusions. The elec-
tron signal is double-peaked due to the Doppler eﬀect
described in [2]. The proﬁle that should apply in a delo-
calized description of this transition is the a1+b2 proﬁle
from Fig. 3 (right) and Eqn. 7 (see also Fig. 2). We convo-
luted the proﬁle with a Gaussian and a Lorentzian func-
tion. The Gaussian function with a FWHM of 140 meV

sition. The dotted line is the convoluted proﬁle from Fig. 3 for

accounts for the limited experimental resolution. The
Lorentzian function with FWHM of 149 meV accounts
for the lifetime broadening, where we assumed the same
core hole lifetime as that of O2 [7]. The convoluted pro-
ﬁle is shown as a dashed line in Fig. 4. The solid line in
Fig. 4 is the likewise convoluted proﬁle for σ transition
from Fig. 3 (left) where we assume an angle of 20◦ be-
tween fragmentation and symmetry axis. This angle ac-
counts for momentum conservation. In addition an angle
of 7◦ between the orbital and the bond is taken into ac-
count. This angle was calculated by Oji and Kosugi [8].
The only free parameter in both functions is ∆(cosθ)max,
which depends on Ef . Ef of the core-excited O-fragment
in the case of O3, is 2.5 eV for the a1+b2 proﬁle and
2.2 eV for the σ proﬁle.

V. DISCUSSION

It is clear from Fig. 4 that the sum of electron-peak
proﬁles for a1 and b2 transition (dashed line) does not
reproduce the experiment. Whereas the proﬁle for a σ

transition (solid line) agrees very well with the experi-
ment. The a1+b2 proﬁle represents a transition delocal-
ized over the molecule, while the σ proﬁle represents a
transition localized to one bond. In that case the inter-
action is only between one of the two OT 1s orbitals and
the incident photon. Which of the two is participating in
the excitation is only given as a probability determined
by the orientation of the chemical bonds relative to the
light vector. This result is schematically summarized in
Fig. 2.

We suggest that the interatomic distance of 2.2 ˚A be-
tween the two terminal oxygen atoms is the crucial pa-
rameter for the here observed eﬀect of localized excita-
tion. Considering the distance between the two OT and
the size of an O1s orbital the energy split is presum-
ably very small (a few meV). Such a small energy split
should lead to a negligible interaction between the core
orbitals.
In other words, the core of the two terminal
oxygen atoms must be regarded as “dissociated”. This
can be compared to the text-book example of H2, where,
in the limit of dissociation, the exact wave function is a
superposition of two degenerate conﬁgurations. In that
limit the importance of dynamical correlation decreases
and the importance of static correlation increases as the
interaction between the electrons vanishes.

VI. CONCLUSION

Core excitation in O3 is found to be localized to one
chemical bond. Analytically derived functions for the
electron-peak proﬁles were used to identify the excitation
geometry of the molecule revealing the fact that the
OT 1s−17a1
1 core-excited state is preferably created with
one O∗
T -OC chemical bond aligned to the e-vector (∗
indicating the core-excited atom). The model assumed
to date for small molecules, delocalizing the excitation
over the two symmetry-equivalent bonds, does not ﬁt
the data. Thus, we provide here the experimental
veriﬁcation for the widely used assumption of core ex-
citation localized to one of several symmetry-equivalent
bonds. We suggest that the large interatomic distance
between the two terminal oxygens is responsible for their
independence of eachother. This distance of 2.2 ˚A can
be used as a rule-of-thumb for the observation of the
phenomenon of localized core excitation.

Appendix A

We derive the explicit electron-peak proﬁles for a1
and b2 transitions of bent molecules of C2ν symmetry.
The diﬀerence we have to take into account compared to
the case of a diatomic is that the axis of fragmentation
and the symmetry axis are not aligned. In other words
the angular distribution for photoexcitation depends on
the angle between the e-vector and the symmetry axis.
Whereas the measured coordinate depends on the an-
gle between the e-vector (which is equal to the detec-
tion axis) and the fragmentation axis (see Fig. 1). We
therefore need to take into account the angle α between
symmetry axis and axis of fragmentation. The way this
is done is by rotating the reference frame of the dipole
moment into the reference frame of the axis of fragmen-
tation.

The angular distribution for photoexcitation, f (θ),
about the polarization of the exciting radiation (e-vector)
for an excitation of a1 symmetry is given by f (θ) =
3
4π cos2 θ. The dipole moment is aligned with the sym-
metry axis of the molecule. We need to integrate the
angular distribution over all angles, but in the frame of
the direction of dissociation. Thus, we have to rotate the
coordinate system into a new coordinate system which
is rotated by the angle α with respect to the old one,
see Fig. 1. The new coordinate system ˜f (θ) is obtained
through a Euler rotation and reads:

˜f (θ)a1 =

(sin2α − (1 − cos2α)cos2θ)

(8)

The dipole moment of a b2 transition is perpendicular
to the symmetry axis and in the molecular plane. The
angular distribution is given by f (θ) = 3
4π sin2 θsin2ϕ.
Transformed into the rotated coordinate system it reads:

˜f (θ)b2 =

(sin2α − (1 − cos2α)cos2θ)

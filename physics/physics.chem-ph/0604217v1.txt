Investigating Auto-correlation of Scattered Light of Mixed

Particles

Yong Sun∗

January 14, 2014

Abstract

In this work, the normalized time auto-correlation function of the electric ﬁeld
of the light g(1) (τ ) that is scattered by the two kinds of particles in dispersion is
investigated. The results show that the logarithm of g(1) (τ ) can be consistent with
a line and many reasons can cause the deviations between an exponentiality and
plots of g(1) (τ ) as a function of delay time τ . The nonexponentiality of g(1) (τ ) is
not only determined by the particle size distribution and scattering angle but also
greatly inﬂuenced by the relationship between the concentrations, mass densities
and the values that the refractive index of the material expands as a function of the
concentration of the two kinds of particles.

INTRODUCTION

For colloidal dispersion systems, light scattering is a widely used technique to measure
the sizes of particles. The dynamic light scattering (DLS) technique is to measure the
particle sizes from the normalized time auto-correlation function of the scattered light
g(2) (τ ). The cumulants [1–4] has been used as a standard method to obtain the ploy-
dispersity of particles from the DLS data. In general, when the DLS data are analyzed,
the size distribution of particles is considered as a mono-disperse distribution if the
logarithm of the normalized time auto-correlation function of the electric ﬁeld of the
light g(1) (τ ) is consistent with a line. The poly-dispersity of the particles is obtained
from the deviation between an exponentiality and g(1) (τ ).

In the previous work [5, 6], for the particles that the number distribution is Gaus-
sian, it has been discussed that the nonexponentiality of g(2) (τ ) is determined by the
particle size distribution and scattering angle. In general, the eﬀects of the particle size
distribution are small on the deviation between an exponentiality and g(2) (τ ) and very
large on the initial slope of the logarithm of g(2) (τ ) and the eﬀects of the scattering
angle are determined by the particle size distribution and mean particle size. Under
some conditions, the nonexponentiality of g(2) (τ ) is greatly inﬂuenced by the scattering
angle.

In this work, the normalized time auto-correlation function of the electric ﬁeld of the
light g(1) (τ ) that is scattered by two kinds of particles in dispersion is investigated. The
results show that the logarithm of g(1) (τ ) can be consistent with a line and many reasons
can cause the deviations between an exponentiality and plots of g(1) (τ ) as a function of
delay time τ . The nonexponentiality of g(1) (τ ) is not only determined by the particle
size distribution and scattering angle but also greatly inﬂuenced by the relationship
between the concentrations, mass densities and the values that the refractive index of
the material expands as a function of the concentration of the two kinds of particles in
dispersion.

2 THEORY

For the two kinds of dilute poly-disperse homogeneous spherical particles in dispersion
where the Rayleigh-Gans-Debye approximation is valid, the total normalized time auto-
correlation function of the electric ﬁeld of the scattered light g(1) (τ ) can be written
as

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

In the previous work [7, 8], it was shown that the expected values of the DLS data
calculated based on the commercial and static particle size information are consistent
with the experimental data. In order to investigate the eﬀects of the mixture of two
kinds of particles on the deviation between an exponentiality and g(1) (τ ) accurately, the
values of g(1) (τ ) were produced directly using Eqs. 1, 4 and 5, respectively.

The eﬀects that the diﬀerent mixtures of the two kinds of particles in dispersion
for the wide size distribution are investigated continually. As exploring the narrow
particle size distribution, the values of a still were chosen as 1, 5 and 10 at a scattering
angle of 30o to increase the light intensity scattered by the particles with the smaller
mean static radius and 1, 0.2 and 0.1 at a scattering angle of 90o to decrease the
light intensity scattered by the particles with the smaller mean static radius. The

4 CONCLUSION

The nonexponentiality of g(1)
total (τ ) is not only determined by the particle size distribu-
tion and scattering angle but also greatly inﬂuenced by the relationship between the
concentrations c, mass densities ρ and the values that the refractive index of the ma-
dn
terial expands as a function of the concentration

the two kinds of particles or the size distribution of one kind of particles can makes the
deviations between an exponentiality and g(1) (τ ), and the nonexponentiality of g(1) (τ )

other information about the particles in dispersion, it is impossible to infer the size
distribution of particles accurately only based on g(1) (τ ) at a single scattering angle.

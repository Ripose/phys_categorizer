Abstract

The phenomenon of resonant activation of a Brownian particle over a ﬂuc-
tuating barrier is revisited. We discuss the important distinctions between
barriers that can ﬂuctuate among “up” and “down” conﬁgurations, and bar-
riers that are always “up” but that can ﬂuctuate among diﬀerent heights. A
resonance as a function of the barrier ﬂuctuation rate is found in both cases,
but the nature and physical description of these resonances is quite distinct.
The nature of the resonances, the physical basis for the resonant behavior,
and the importance of boundary conditions are discussed in some detail. We
obtain analytic expressions for the escape time over the barrier that explicitly
capture the minima as a function of the barrier ﬂuctuation rate, and show
that our analytic results are in excellent agreement with numerical results.

I. INTRODUCTION

Noise-induced non-equilibrium phenomena in nonlinear systems have recently attracted
a great deal of attention in a variety of contexts [1]. In general, these phenomena involve
a response of the system that is not only produced or enhanced by the presence of the
noise, but that is optimized for certain values of the parameters of the noise. One example
is the phenomenon of stochastic resonance [2], wherein the response of a nonlinear system
to a signal is enhanced by the presence of noise and maximized for certain values of the
noise parameters. Another involves nonequilibrium ratchets, wherein intrinsically unbiased
Brownian motion in stochastic asymmetric potentials leads to a systematic drift motion
whose magnitude and even direction can be tuned by the parameters of the noise [3,4]. A
third is the recent discovery of a re-entrant noise-induced phase transition in a nonlinear
coupled array, that is, a transition that is only observed for certain ﬁnite ranges of noise
parameters [5]. A fourth such phenomenon, the one of interest to us in this paper, has been
called “resonant activation” and was ﬁrst identiﬁed by Doering and Gadoua [6] and further
studied by a number of other authors. Here the mean escape time of a particle driven by
(usually white) noise over a barrier of randomly ﬂuctuating height exhibits a minimum as a
function of the parameters of the barrier ﬂuctuations.

Our interest in this problem ﬁrst arose because it seemed to us that for suﬃciently
simple potentials it should be possible to ﬁnd analytic dependences of the escape rate on the
system parameters (or at least good approximations to them) and, more speciﬁcally, that
it should be possible to ﬁnd analytic expressions for the parameter combinations that lead
to the minimum in the escape rate. Some analytic results are available [6–11], including
those in the original work of Doering and Gadoua that apply to a very speciﬁc circumstance
discussed in more detail below. In general, however, most available results are numerical
[11]. Analytic results are scarce, and usually apply only to one parameter regime or another
and are thus unable to explicitly capture the occurrence of a minimum in the escape rate.
A minimum in the escape rate usually arises from these approximations only by inference,
and the approximations provide no way to speciﬁcally locate the minimum except as an
intersection point of two unrelated approximations. They also do not provide a way to
determine the dependence of the minimum on the system parameters.

In this paper we accomplish our goal, that is, we obtain a number of analytic results for
moments of the ﬁrst passage time over a ﬂuctuating barrier for the particular model system (a
triangular potential barrier subject to dichotomous ﬂuctuations) used in a number of studies
of resonant activation.
In particular, we obtain analytic approximations that explicitly
capture not only the minimum in the escape rate but that allow us to study the variability
of the escape rate in parameter space, that is, the depth and width of this minimum.

In the process of obtaining these results we have also accomplished a number of important
clariﬁcations on the nature of models that have been presented under the common “resonant
activation” rubric, and on the nature of resonant activation itself. Some of these models
in fact diﬀer from one another in essential respects. We discuss these clariﬁcations and
diﬀerences in some detail, and thus shed some light on the role played by the interplay of
the white noise and the barrier ﬂuctuations on the escape process. We anticipate some of
our ﬁndings:

A distinction must be made between situations in which the ﬂuctuating barrier can

•

2

be “up” or “down” (i.e. can go from being a barrier to being ﬂat or even a well),
and situations in which there is always a barrier. Although resonant behavior can
be observed in all cases, the physical picture underlying this behavior is diﬀerent in
diﬀerent cases.

•

•

Boundary conditions play an extremely important role in the problem.

≤

The qualitative physical description of the resonance in the ﬂuctuating barrier problem
is as follows. When the barrier ﬂuctuates extremely slowly within a range 0 < υmin ≤
υ
υmax, the mean ﬁrst passage time to the top of the barrier is extremely long
because it is dominated by those realizations for which the barrier starts in the high
position. The mean ﬁrst passage time is then proportional to eυmax/D where D is the
intensity of the white noise. Indeed, if the barrier ﬂuctuation rate is smaller than the
inverse of the mean ﬁrst passage time to the highest barrier, the barrier is essentially
quasi-static throughout the process. At the other extreme, if the barrier ﬂuctuates
very rapidly, the mean ﬁrst passage time is determined by the average barrier υ0, i.e.
it is proportional to eυ0/D. Between these extremes, and over a broad range of barrier
ﬂuctuation rates, passage over the barrier occurs primarily when the barrier is low, and
the mean ﬁrst passage time is then proportional to eυmin/D. This dependence is quite
robust, and the prefactor determines the actual minimum within this broad range.

•

This behavior does not require that the barrier ﬂuctuate; an oscillatory variation of
the barrier height yields essentially the same results.

In Sec. II we provide a detailed statement of the resonance activation problem. Section III
discusses the analytic solution of the “up”–“down” case; we show that the resonance ﬂipping
rate and the resonance activation in this case are independent of the white noise intensity.
In Sec. IV the signiﬁcance of the white noise and of the boundary conditions in this “up”–
“down” problem are discussed in detail. Section V deals with the case of barrier ﬂuctuations
when the barriers are always high. We obtain a single analytic expression for the mean ﬁrst
passage time that exhibits a minimum as a function of the barrier ﬂuctuation rate and
that in fact quantitatively captures the correct behavior over most of parameter space, as
determined by comparison with numerical results. With this result we are able to determine
the resonance frequency analytically, and also the range of barrier ﬂuctuation rates over
which the mean ﬁrst passage time is essentially ﬂat. In Sec. VI we discuss the case of a
barrier that oscillates (rather than ﬂuctuates). This case also exhibits resonant activation,
although some of the quantitative details of the problem are slightly modiﬁed. Finally, we
conclude with a summary and some ﬁnal points in Sec. VII.

II. STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM

Consider a process that evolves in a bistable potential and is driven by weak Gaussian
white noise, so that the process is occasionally able to cross from one minimum of the
bistable potential to the other. If the parameters of the system are ﬁxed in time, the rate
at which the process crosses from one well to the other under a variety of conditions is well
known (e.g. the Kramers rate). Suppose now that the height of the barrier separating the

3

two minima of the bistable potential ﬂuctuates in time. We wish to explore the eﬀect of the
barrier ﬂuctuations on the rate of passage of the process from one well to the other. More
speciﬁcally, it is known that there is an optimal barrier ﬂuctuation rate that minimizes the
passage time from one well to the other for given parameter values [6–11], This minimum
identiﬁes the phenomenon of resonant activation. We are interested in the analytic properties
of the resonant activation phenomenon. Note that the barrier ﬂuctuations here are such that
the energy diﬀerence between the potential minima remains constant — only the barrier
height ﬂuctuates. This is to be contrasted with the phenomenon of stochastic resonance,
where the energy diﬀerence is modulated by a small periodic signal.

We adhere to the overdamped regime, and hence the process y(τ ) evolves according to

the Langevin equation

Here ξ(τ ) is zero-centered Gaussian white noise with correlation function

One can think of the white noise as arising from a heat bath, in which case the diﬀusion
coeﬃcient D is proportional to the bath temperature T . Time is measured in units of the
friction coeﬃcient, which has been set to unity in Eq. (1).

The potential V (y) is a bistable potential, typically with isoenergetic minima. Doering
and Gadoua [6] introduced the triangular potential shown in Fig. 1. The potential barrier
is deﬁned by

and the potential rises to inﬁnity at y = 0 and at y = 2L. In the absence of the contribution
g′(y)η(τ ) in Eq. (1) this represents a standard problem where the rate κ at which the process
T1 from the bottom of
crosses the barrier at x = L is related to the mean ﬁrst passage time
one of the wells, say the one at y = 0, to the top of the barrier: κ = 1/2
T1. To calculate
the mean ﬁrst passage time one assumes a reﬂecting boundary condition at y = 0 and an
absorbing boundary condition at y = L.

In the resonant activation problem we have, in addition, the contribution g′(y)η(τ ). Here
η(τ ) is a non-equilibrium noise that coupled to g′(y) causes the potential barrier to ﬂuctuate.
It is a nonequilibrium noise because there is no dissipative contribution in the equation of
motion associated with this ﬂuctuating term, and hence the system is open. The noise η(τ )
is usually taken to be exponentially correlated, the most ubiquitous choices being Ornstein-
Uhlenbeck noise [9–11] and Markovian dichotomous noise [8,11]. Here we deal only with the
latter: η(τ ) takes on the values
1, and the change from one to the other is distributed in
time according to the exponential density function

and zero otherwise. The addition of the random potential term g(y)η(τ ) causes the potential
barrier to switch between the two values υ+ = υ0 + α and υ− = υ0 −
We wish to calculate the rate at which the process crosses the point y = L, which in turn
T1 from y = 0 to y = L when a reﬂecting
is related, as before, to the mean ﬁrst passage time
boundary is located at y = 0 and an absorbing boundary at y = L. (The distortions in the
potential proﬁle that may be caused by multiplicative noise, and the implications on the
appropriate deﬁnition of an escape time, are well known and have been widely discussed in
the literature; see. e.g. [11]. The potentials used here do not exhibit such distortions.) In
T1 on the ﬂipping rate γ and
particular, we wish to establish analytically the dependence of
to identify the ﬂipping rate for which

T1 is a minimum.
Doering and Gadoua [6] calculated the mean ﬁrst passage time for this model in the
absence of the potential V (y), that is, when the “barrier” ﬂips between being a true barrier
(of height +α) to being a well (
α), and they obtained a resonance phenomenon, that is,
the mean ﬁrst passage time from 0 to L exhibits a minimum at a particular value of the
ﬂipping rate γ. Doering and Gadoua also presented simulation results for the case υ0 = α,
that is, when the “barrier” ﬂips between being a true barrier (height 2α) and there being
no barrier. Bier and Astumian [7] considered the true barrier case, that is, the case where
α) and obtained numerical results that
there is always a barrier (in fact, they took υ0 ≫
show a resonance. Their analytic barrier crossing rate results are obtained separately for low
ﬂipping rates (small γ) and for high ﬂipping rates (large γ). Neither result in itself exhibits
a minimum, although one can infer the existence of a minimum (but not its dependence on
the system parameters; see also [11]) from their combination.

With this general statement of the problem we can be more precise about the results
α barrier-well case of Doering and
that we present in this paper. First, we consider the
Gadoua, reproduce their analytic results for the mean ﬁrst passage time, and also obtain
analytic results for the resonant mean ﬁrst passage time, the resonant ﬂipping rate, and for
α barrier case
the second moment of the ﬁrst passage time distribution. We argue that the
represents a situation that is completely diﬀerent from the “true barrier” case considered
by Bier and Astumian. Both exhibit resonance behavior, but via diﬀerent mechanisms. We
explore these diﬀerences and interpret the Doering–Gadoua case on the basis of an even
simpler model. Furthermore, we obtain analytic results for the high barrier case considered
by Bier and Astumian that yield an explicit minimum in the mean ﬁrst passage time as a
function of the ﬂipping rate. We present analytic results for the mean ﬁrst passage time at
resonance, for the resonant ﬂipping rate, and we analyze the behavior of the system away
from this point to assess how sharp this resonance might be.

III. ANALYTICAL SOLUTION OF THE DOERING–GADOUA MODEL

Consider the mean ﬁrst passage time to x = 1 (y = L) when the mean barrier height

This result has been previously reported for the particular initial value x = 0 [6]. We
T1 exhibits a resonance with respect to λ; we wish to
know from Ref. [6] that T1(x = 0)
establish the resonance ﬂipping rate λres and the behavior of the mean ﬁrst passage time at
this resonance point.

≡

The expression for the mean ﬁrst passage time simpliﬁes considerably when the dimen-
sionless quantity µ is large (µ
1), which is the physically interesting weak-white-noise
regime. Indeed, the only way that µ could be small is if α and λ are small, that is, if (in
dimensioned units) the white noise intensity D is greater than the barrier height α and
greater than 2γL2. The ﬁrst condition renders the problem uninteresting - if barriers are on

average lower than the noise then one has an essentially free diﬀusion problem. The second
condition requires a small system with a low ﬂipping rate, again a very speciﬁc situation that
is not particularly interesting in this context. The customarily interesting physical situation
occurs when the white noise is weak compared to the barrier height, that is, when a

and this in turn leads to µ
1. We use these two statements of the “interesting regime”
interchangeably.

The second order moment of the ﬁrst passage time distribution, T2, also exhibits a
resonance. However, the resonant frequency of T2 does not coincide with that of T1. This
means that there does not exist a unique resonant frequency or universal scaling associated
with the ﬁrst passage time distribution. T2 can be calculated in a similar way (albeit even
more expansively) than T1. However, the full expression for T2(x) is too long to be included

0, the barrier never ﬂips as the process moves from 0 to L. If the barrier
rate is very low, λ
is initially “down” (η(0) =
1), then it remains down and the process is simply diﬀusively
driven toward the absorbing barrier by a constant force; as α/D
, the motion of the
system becomes increasingly ballistic. If the barrier is initially “up” (η(0) = 1), on the other
hand, it remains up and the process moves between the reﬂective barrier at y = 0 and the
absorbing barrier at y = L against a constant opposing force. The mean ﬁrst passage time
for such a process grows exponentially with the barrier height as D2eα/D/α2 [12]. In our
calculations either initial conﬁguration is equally likely. The average of these two possibilities
is the leading term in Eq. (22) (the ballistic contribution is negligible):

IV. A SIMPLER MODEL SHOWING RESONANT ACTIVATION

A surprising observation about the results of the Doering–Gadoua model is that the
Tres,
resonant frequency γres and the mean ﬁrst passage time at this resonant frequency,
do not depend on the white noise intensity D to leading order in α. This means that as
α/D
, the resonant properties become increasingly independent of the white noise
intensity. Indeed, the resonance therefore appears unaﬀected by and unrelated to the white
noise; in particular, the minimum in the mean-ﬁrst-passage time in the Doering–Gadoua
model appears not to arise from the coupling usually invoked between the white noise and
the random dynamics of the potential.

→ ∞

e

We have used somewhat equivocal language in this description because the situation is in
fact somewhat subtle. The resonance in the Doering-Gadoua model arises from two features:
1) the random dynamics of the potential (that is, the random switching between barrier up
and barrier down) and, in particular, the initial average over these dynamics, and 2) the
nature of the reﬂecting boundary at x = 0. It is this latter feature, subtly inﬂuenced by
the white noise, that is especially noteworthy: the resonance characteristics of the Doering–
0 are not reproduced by simply setting D = 0 to begin with in
Gadoua result when D
the model equations.

To pursue this issue in more detail, let us consider the same model equations as did
Doering and Gadoua but now in the absence of white noise from the outset. In place of
Eq. (1), the system thus evolves according to the simpler Langevin equation

˙y(τ ) =

g′(y)η(τ ).

The solution of this mean ﬁrst passage time problem is most easily found by splitting
into two components [13]:
and
representation lies in the ease of expression of the boundary conditions in terms of

In this case, whenever the system reaches the boundary at y = 0 the velocity immediately
changes its sign, that is, the driving noise η(τ ) changes its value from

ﬂuctuations since arrival at the boundary causes the noise to change its value. It is easy

There is another way to think of a reﬂecting boundary, namely, to assume that the
boundary only limits the region of movement of the system without interfering with the
dynamics of the dichotomous barrier ﬂuctuations. The dichotomous noise evolves according
to its own dynamics, and changes its value at random times that are independent of where
the process y(τ ) happens to be. Thus, if the system reaches the boundary y = 0 when the
noise happens to be η =
1, the noise may retain this value according to its own statistical
properties. The process simply waits at the boundary, until the noise switches to η = 1
in the natural course of events. We call this condition a “natural” reﬂecting boundary
condition. This behavior is implemented via the following boundary condition for the mean
ﬁrst passage time components:

the reﬂecting boundary condition used for the solution of the Doering–Gadoua model is
(9). In the Doering–Gadoua model, no matter how weak the white noise, its eﬀects become
dominant near the reﬂecting boundary. The white noise allows reversal of the trajectory even
inﬁnitesimally close to the reﬂecting boundary without triggering a ﬂip of the barrier, thus
removing the dynamical interference between the boundary and the dichotomous ﬂipping
process. There is therefore a profound diﬀerence between the situation in which white noise
is present, albeit as weak as one wishes, and the situation in which there is no white noise
in the ﬁrst place — the limit D
0 is discontinuous. In the Doering–Gadoua model there
is a resonance in the mean ﬁrst passage time to absorption because, through the action of
the white noise (no matter how weak) the process can delay (increasingly as the white noise
intensity decreases) arrival at the absorbing state if the barrier is up and does not ﬂip of its
own dynamics. However, the characteristics of the resonant ﬂipping rate and the mean ﬁrst
passage time at resonance do not explicitly depend on the intensity of the white noise.

V. THE BIER–ASTUMIAN MODEL

e

e

The main conclusion that follows from the discussion of the preceding sections is that
the resonant eﬀect in the “toy” model of Doering and Gadoua is not of the same nature
as the resonant activation in systems where the activation process is exclusively due to the
presence of white noise (i.e., nonzero temperature). In order to study the resonant process
in this latter situation, we return to the full model introduced by Doering and Gadoua but
now with V0 > a, so that there is always a barrier. This problem was ﬁrst analytically
studied by Bier and Astumian [7]. The approximation developed by these authors coincides
with the so called kinetic approximation introduced in Ref. [16]. The main limitation of this
method for the present purposes is that it leads to a mean ﬁrst passage time that does not
exhibit a minimum.

We have developed an approximation for the mean ﬁrst passage time to the absorbing
boundary for high average barriers (V0 ≫
1) that does lead to a minimum and hence
can be used to describe the resonance phenomenon analytically. We return to the Langevin

where the second line, valid if a

passage time is essentially the usual passage time over the lower of the two barriers. It is
not particularly instructive to exhibit the full expression (45) for the resonance frequency in
the original units, but if a

1 we can display the shorter expression

≥

It should be noted that both the resonant mean ﬁrst passage and the resonant frequency
depend on the intensity of the white noise, as does their product. This dependence appears
in the exponents as well as prefactors.

A general feature of our solution and, more generally, of the resonant activation phe-
nomenon is that with increasing barrier height the resonance phenomenon becomes less
and less sharp: a long ﬂat region develops around the resonant frequency, a fact that has
been explicitly noted in earlier work [17]. Analysis of Eq.(42) makes it possible to estimate
analytic bounds of this ﬂat region, which spans the range

Thus, rather than stressing the resonance aspect of the problem, it might be more accurate
to describe the time scale of the activation process as relatively insensitive to the parameters
of the system except in the limits of very low and very high barrier ﬂuctuation rates. As
noted above, if the barrier ﬂuctuations are suﬃciently slow, then an initially high barrier
remains that way essentially forever and the system on average crosses it before the barrier
ﬂips. Passage over the higher barrier then dominates the mean ﬁrst passage time. At the
other extreme, when the barrier ﬂuctuations are very rapid, crossing occurs essentially over
the average barrier. However, over most parameter ranges the mean ﬁrst passage time is
essentially determined by passage over the lower barrier – the system can avoid passage over
the higher barrier by “waiting” for it to ﬂip. Provided the waiting time is shorter than the
time it would take the system to cross the high barrier, ﬂipping will occur ﬁrst and the
system will cross when the barrier is lower (unless ﬂipping is too rapid). This process is
most eﬃcient (but not dramatically more eﬃcient – hence the ﬂat behavior) at the resonance
frequency.

In Fig. 6 the mean ﬁrst passage time and the diﬀerent approximations explained above
have been plotted for V0 = 11 and a = 1. Our approximation clearly captures the resonance
behavior extremely accurately and for that matter the behavior of the mean ﬁrst passage
time over a broad range of barrier ﬂuctuation rates. Fig. 7 again shows the mean ﬁrst passage

14

time, but now with V0 = 15 and a = 1. This ﬁgure serves to reconﬁrm the agreement of our
results with the numerical ones, and also illustrates the ﬂattening of the region around the
resonance as the height of the barrier increases. Fig. 8 shows the resonance frequency as a
function of the barrier height. Again, our approximation clearly captures the exact results
extremely well for suﬃciently high barriers.

VI. ACTIVATION DRIVEN BY A SQUARE WAVE FUNCTION

It is interesting to explore whether the resonant activation phenomenon requires that
the barrier ﬂuctuate stochastically, or whether it also occurs when a noisy process crosses
Indeed, stochastic ﬂuctuation of the barrier is not a
a barrier that changes periodically.
requirement.

To investigate the activation process when the barrier oscillates periodically between a
higher value and a lower value, we replace the dichotomous noise η(τ ) in Eq. (1) with a
square wave w(τ ), a periodic function that alternately takes on the values +1 and
1. The
changes from one to the other occur at a constant frequency γ. The period of the square
wave function is thus 2/γ.

−

The Fokker-Planck equation describing the evolution of the probability for the system
now includes a time-periodic potential. The problem can be tackled analytically using
Floquet theory. We simply state qualitatively the results that one obtains with this exact
approach, but then follow a simpler approach to arrive at some quantitative conclusions.

We continue our discussion in terms of dimensionless variables and parameters. Exact
solution of the problem does, as noted above, also lead to resonant activation when the
barrier changes from higher to lower periodically, with a resonance behavior very similar
to that of the stochastic case. In other words, the mean ﬁrst passage time is large when
the period of oscillation is very slow and also when it is very fast. As before, and for the
same physical reasons, in the former case the mean ﬁrst passage time is dominated by the
high barrier V+ and in the latter case it is determined by the average barrier V0. Again as
before, between these two limits there is a ﬂat region (i.e., rather insensitive to the parameter
values) where the mean ﬁrst passage time is determined primarily by the lower barrier V−.
The only diﬀerence between this problem and the stochastic one lies in the detailed way in
which the mean ﬁrst passage time changes from one behavior to the other.

To ﬁnd the mean ﬁrst passage time at the slow-barrier-modulation end of the problem
(where the diﬀerence between stochastic and periodic modulation is most pronounced), we
recall that for a ﬁxed barrier of height V the probability that the process has not yet crossed
the barrier at time t (i.e., the survival probability at time t), is exponential [18], e−kt, where
the crossing rate k = V 2e−V [cf. Eq. (50)]. If the barrier is not ﬁxed, but instead changes
λ−1 with
slowly from one value to the other at predetermined periodic time intervals ∆
λ <
1, we can track the trajectory of the system explicitly and write down an expression for
∼
the survival probability S(t) that the process has not yet crossed the barrier at time t. If
initially the barrier is V+ and the time t = 0 corresponds to the beginning of a period, then

happen when the barrier is, respectively, V+ and V−. The assumption about the statistics
of the crossing events yields

q± = e−k±/λ.

(57)

The mean ﬁrst passage time T + can then be calculated directly as a moment of this probabil-
ity. The survival probability S− and associated mean ﬁrst passage time T − when the barrier
is initially V− is similarly obtained. To compare most directly with the stochastic results we
assume that initially the barrier is equally likely to be V+ or V−. A short calculation then
leads to the following result for the mean ﬁrst passage time when λ <

This result corresponds to the same level of approximation as the kinetic result (49). At
very low frequencies, λ
0, the mean escape time is correctly given by an average of the
escape time 1/k+ when the barrier is V+ and 1/k− when the barrier is V−. This kinetic
approximation also does not exhibit a minimum because it does not behave correctly when

In Fig. 9 the approximation (58) to the mean escape time for the activation process
driven by a periodic signal is compared with the escape time for the same system driven
by dichotomous noise. The diﬀerence between the two is noticeable in the decrease of the
mean ﬁrst passage time with increasing ﬂipping rate — the dependence on ﬂipping rate is
considerably sharper in the periodic case than in the random case. A similar eﬀect has been
observed recently in systems that exhibit coherent stochastic resonance [19]. The minimum
ﬁrst passage time and resonance ﬂipping rate are essentially identical in the two cases.

VII. CONCLUSION

We have revisited the problem of resonant activation, that is, of the mean escape time of
a particle driven by white noise of intensity D over a barrier of randomly ﬂuctuating height.
The initial position of the particle is y = 0 and the barrier is at y = L. A substantial recent
literature [6–9,11,16] deals with this problem, but the results to be found in the literature
are almost exclusively numerical. The distribution of barrier ﬂuctuations is typically taken
to be either dichotomous (i.e., the barrier ﬂuctuates between two values) or Gaussian. The
correlation function of the barrier ﬂuctuations is usually assumed to be exponential and thus
T1
characterized by a rate parameter γ. The quantity of interest is the mean escape time
of the particle over the barrier as a function of γ. It is observed that
T1 vs. γ exhibits a
e
minimum, i.e., there is an optimal barrier ﬂuctuation rate that minimizes the escape time
of the particle. This minimum deﬁnes the resonant activation phenomenon.

e

In this paper we have concentrated on dichotomous ﬂuctuations and on triangular po-
tential barriers, so our quantitative results are restricted to these cases. However, we believe
that our results provide insights beyond these speciﬁc conditions. In particular, they pro-
vide insights for barriers whose ﬂuctuations are bounded between an upper value υ+ and

16

a lower value υ−. The applicability of our conclusions to Gaussian ﬂuctuations is therefore
less certain, but below we will present some conjectures for this case as well.

A variety of approaches to the problem of the escape over a ﬂuctuating barrier of bounded
variation provide excellent and consistent analytic approximations to the escape rate in the
limiting cases of very slow barrier ﬂuctuations and of very fast barrier ﬂuctuations. In the
slow ﬂuctuation case, the so-called “kinetic approximation” [16] captures the behavior of
the system very well. In the limit of very slow ﬂuctuations (γ
0) the barrier retains its
initial height throughout the process. The mean ﬁrst passage time for the ensemble is then
just the mean ﬁrst passage time averaged over the initial distribution of barrier heights.
For example, in the dichotomous case if the height of the high barrier is υ+ then the mean
escape time as γ
0 is determined by the mean escape time over this high barrier (the
mean escape time over the lower barrier being negligible in comparison):

This is the result captured, for instance, in Eq. (28) and in Eq. (52. Clearly, this result
is determined in part by the assumption (generally made in the literature) that an initial
average over an ensemble of barrier heights is appropriate. The entire discussion that follows,
including the occurrence of a resonance, is dependent on such an initial average or at least
on the assumption that a ﬁnite fraction of realizations begin with a barrier conﬁguration
that is higher than the lowest barrier.

At the opposite extreme, when the barrier ﬂuctuations are very rapid (γ

), the
main eﬀect of the ﬂipping barrier is to increase the eﬀective intensity of the white noise.
The escape then occurs over the average barrier, with a diﬀusion coeﬃcient Def f which
exceeds D by an amount determined by the detailed distribution of barrier ﬂuctuations. If
the average barrier height is υ0 > 0 then the mean escape time in this limit is

These are the results captured in Eqs. (26) and (48). In any case, the escape time is clearly
smaller in the fast barrier ﬂuctuation limit than in the slow barrier ﬂuctuation limit.

In the literature, each of the above approximations had been carried suﬃciently far to
deduce the behavior of the escape time as one moves away from the strict limits. Thus, within
the kinetic approximation it can be shown that the escape time decreases with increasing
γ. At the opposite limit, it can be shown that the escape time decreases with decreasing
γ. These two results clearly point to a minimum for some ﬁnite value of γ, but neither
approximation is suﬃcient to actually capture the minimum. Our goal here has been to
develop a single approximation to capture this minimum, and in this we succeeded.

However, we found in the process that a distinction needs to be made between two
cases that lead to a diﬀerent physical origin and parameter dependences for the resonant

ﬂipping rate and the associated escape time. These two cases have in the literature been
treated more or less as one because both involve dichotomous ﬂuctuations, but they are in
fact very diﬀerent. One of these is the case in which the “barrier” ﬂuctuates between an
“up” or positive (barrier) conﬁguration of height υ+ = α and a “down” or negative (valley)
conﬁguration of height υ− =
α. We have called this the Doering–Gadoua model [6]. In
the other case, the barrier ﬂuctuates between a high value υ+ = υ0 + α and a lower (but still
α. We have called this the Bier–Astumian model [7]. For each
positive) value υ− = υ0 −
model we found a single expression for the mean ﬁrst passage time that has a minimum,
and we compared our results with exact ones obtained numerically. The agreement in both
cases is excellent for almost the entire range of ﬂipping rates, and in particular over a broad
range surrounding the resonance.

−

The distinctive aspect of the Doering–Gadoua model is the fact that part of the time the
“barrier” is really a valley, so that the particle can essentially roll rather than climb towards
L during these times. We found an explicit expression for the resonant ﬂipping rate and the
resonant mean ﬁrst passage time in this case:

The noteworthy fact about these results is that neither the resonant ﬂipping rate nor the
resonant escape time depend explicitly on the intensity D of the white noise. This fact
seems not to have been noted before. We then went on to explore whether in fact this
resonance is observed in a process deﬁned by the Doering–Gadoua model with no white
noise from the outset, and found that there is no resonance for such a model! We explained
this apparent contradiction by noting a discontinuity in the D
0 limit of the problem and
by presenting a modiﬁed set of boundary conditions that does lead to a resonance (precisely
the Doering–Gadoua resonance) in the absence of white noise.

→

In order to obtain a result for the escape time in the Bier–Astumian model that cap-
tures the resonant behavior we found that we had to retain terms in our solutions to one
power higher in γ than had been done previously (the lower orders yielded only the kinetic
approximation) [7]. With this, we identiﬁed the resonant frequency and escape times as

and (more complete results are found in Sec. V)

We noted that that in this case both the resonance frequency and the mean ﬁrst passage
time at the resonance frequency depend on the intensity of the white noise, as does their
product. At resonance the escape over the barrier occurs primarily when the barrier is at its
lowest. We also noted that the dependence on the ﬂipping rate, especially for high barriers,

(62)

(63)

(64)

(65)

is very ﬂat: there is a broad range of ﬂipping rates where passage over the barrier occurs
primarily when the barrier is low. In this broad range of ﬂipping rates the escape time over
the high barrier is so long that the barrier is likely to ﬂip to its lower height before the
escape is completed.

We also discussed the fact that the resonant activation phenomenon does not require a
ﬂuctuating barrier — it also occurs if the barrier oscillates periodically between the high and
low values. The behavior of the escape time at low and high oscillation periods is the same
as in the dichotomous ﬂuctuation case, and at intermediate oscillation periods a resonance
eﬀect is also observed.

Finally, we note that our analysis does not address the case of Gaussian barrier ﬂuctua-
tions, that is, of Ornstein–Uhlenbeck barrier ﬂuctuations [11]. The results for such barrier
ﬂuctuations with ﬁxed variance [10] should be similar to our results for dichotomous noise. In
particular, the escape time for the model analogous to that of Doering and Gadoua (V0 = 0)
will show a minimum even in the absence of white noise.

APPENDIX A: SURVIVAL PROBABILITY AND FIRST PASSAGE TIME
MOMENTS

The moments of the ﬁrst passage time from x = 0 to x = 1 can be obtained from the
survival probability S(x, t) that the system evolving according to Eq. (1) (appropriately
scaled to dimensionless variables) with a reﬂecting boundary at x = 0 and an absorbing
boundary at x = 1 has not left the interval (0, 1) at time t. This survival probability obeys
the following partial diﬀerential equation (a detailed derivation and original references for
the survival probability in an interval terminated by two absorbing boundaries are presented
in Ref. [20]):

a fourth order partial diﬀerential equation in the state variable. Therefore, two initial
conditions and four boundary conditions are needed to solve it. The initial conditions are

The ﬁrst-passage-time moments Tn are related to the survival probability according to

Clearly T0(x) = 1 by normalization. T1(x) is the mean ﬁrst passage time to 1 for a process
that starts at X(0) = x; T2(x) is the second moment of the distribution, so that the variance
of the distribution of mean ﬁrst passage times is σ2

Equations for the ﬁrst passage time moments can be obtained by multiplying Eq. (A1)
by tn−1 and integrating over time by parts. The following recursive-diﬀerential equation is
easily found:

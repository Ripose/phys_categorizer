Knowledge of the ratios between diﬀerent polarizability βi′j′k′ tensor elements of a chemical
group in a molecule is crucial for quantitative interpretation and polarization analysis of its SFG-
VS spectrum at interfaces. The bond additivity model or the hyperpolarizability derivative model
along with experimentally obtained Raman depolarization ratios has been widely used to obtain such
tensor ratios for the CH3, CH2, and CH groups. Successfully, such treatment can quantitatively
reproduce the intensity polarization dependence in SFG-VS spectra for the symmetric (ss) and
asymmetric (as) stretching modes of CH3 and CH2 groups, respectively. However, the relative
intensity between the ss and as modes usually does not agree with each other within this model
even for some of the simplest molecular systems, such as the air/methanol interface. This fact
certainly has cast uncertainties on the eﬀectiveness and conclusions based on the bond additivity
model. One of such examples is that the as mode of CH3 group has never been observed in SFG-
VS spectra from the air/methanol interface, while this as mode is usually very strong for SFG-VS
spectra from the air/ethanol, other short chain alcohol, as well as long chain surfactants, interfaces.
In order to answer these questions, an empirical approach from known Raman and IR spectra is used
to make corrections to the bond additivity model. With the corrected ratios between the βi′j′k′
tensor elements of the ss and as modes, all features in the SFG-VS spectra of the air/methanol
and air/ethanol interface can be quantitatively interpreted within the bond additivity model. This
empirical approach not only provides new understandings of the eﬀectiveness and limitations of the
bond additivity model, but also provides a practical roadmap for its application in SFG-VS studies
of molecular interfaces.

INTRODUCTION

including vapor/liquid,

Since the ﬁrst report of Sum Frequency generation
Vibrational Spectroscopy (SFG-VS) experiment in early
1987,1 SFG-VS has been widely used to investigate var-
ious molecular interfaces,
liq-
uid/liquid, air(vacuum gas)/solid, and liquid/solid in-
terfaces, because SFG-VS, as one of the second order
is interface selective and
nonlinear optical processes,
is sensitive to submonolayer changes at the molecular
interface.2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 Since the very beginning, quan-
titative interpretation of the SFG-VS spectra has been
used to derive molecular orientational structure and or-
der of the molecular interfaces under study.11,12

The key for such quantitative interpretation lies on the
ability to obtain or estimate the ratios between diﬀer-
ent microscopic polarizability βi′j′k′ tensor elements of
a chemical group in a molecule.10,13,14 So far, almost all
of the eﬀorts have focused on the stretching vibrational
modes. The approaches employed to obtain the βi′j′k′
tensor ratios are all based on the following general re-
lationship between the second order hyperpolarizability
tensors (βq
i′j′k′ ) for a particular vibrational mode q to
the Raman polarizability derivative tensors (∂αi′j′ /∂Qq,
usually denote as α′
i′j′ ) and dipole moment derivative
tensors (∂µk′ /∂Qq, usually denote as µ′
k′ ) of the qth

Here (i′j′k′) represents the molecular coordinates sys-
tem, ωq and Qq are the vibrational frequency, and the
normal coordinates of the qth vibrational mode of the
molecule, respectively. Therefore, according to Eq.1, if
the proper ratios between diﬀerent α′
i′j′ terms and the
ratios between diﬀerent µ′
k′ terms are known, the ratios
of βq

i′j′k′ elements can be readily obtained.

Among the approaches to obtain βq

i′j′k′ tensor ratios,
which shall be compared in detail in Section II, the bond
additivity model is based on symmetry analysis along
with the Raman bond polarizability derivative theory
and the bond moment theory.10,16,17,18 In some cases,
it has been proven successful in quantitative interpreta-
tion of the symmetric stretching (ss) vibrational mode in
SFG-VS studies.10,11,12,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26 How-
ever, it often failed to quantitatively predict the SFG
spectral intensity relationship between the symmetric
stretching (ss) and asymmetric stretching (as) vibra-
tional modes, as shall be discussed in detail in Section II.
Therefore, the limitations and eﬀectiveness of the bond
additivity model still needs to be investigated.

In this report, we shall employ an complete empirical
approach to the bond additivity model by using exper-
imental IR and Raman spectra to correct the discrep-
ancies between the α′
i′j′ and µ′
k′ tensors of the molec-
ular groups. The eﬀectiveness of this approach shall be
demonstrated with the ss and as modes of the CH3 group
in CH3OH and CH3CD2OH molecules. We shall show

i′j′ and µ′

that with the experimentally corrected α′
k′ ten-
sor relationships, the βi′j′k′ tensor ratios calculated from
Eq.1 can be used successfully to quantitatively inter-
pret detailed polarization dependence in SFG-VS spec-
tra of the vapor/CH3OH and vapor/CH3CD2OH inter-
faces. This empirical approach overcomes the limitations
of the current simple bond additivity model, and it also
provides a practical roadmap for its application in SFG-
VS studies of molecular interfaces. This approach also
demonstrates how to use molecular IR and Raman spec-
tra in the bulk liquid or gaseous phases for quantitative
understanding of the SFG-VS vibrational spectra of the
same molecule at the interface, and vise versa.

II. BACKGROUND

Here we brieﬂy compare the diﬀerent approaches for
obtaining βq
i′j′k′ tensor ratios, and discuss how and why
the bond additivity model failed to predict the SFG spec-
tral intensity relationship between the symmetric stretch-
ing (ss) and asymmetric stretching (as) vibrational modes

A. Three approaches for the βq

i′j′k′ tensor ratios

As a 3rd rank tensor, βq

i′j′k′ has 3 × 3 × 3 = 27 ten-
In the most ideal case, the ra-
sor elements in total.
tios between all of these tensor elements should be deter-
mined apriori. Recently, Hore et al. proposed a whole
molecule approach based on a general scheme for ab initio
calculation of the vibrational hyperpolarizability of any
IR- and Raman-active mode, regardless of the molecu-
lar symmetry or complexity of the structure, and ap-
plication of this approach to the -OSO3 headgroup of a
surfactant molecule at the air/water interface was also
demonstrated.14 With the tremendous advancement of
the capability and availability of the ab initio compu-
tation methods, the advantage of this whole molecule
approach is apparent. However, because this approach
is purely computational, its general accuracy can be af-
fected by the limitations of the current ab initio computa-
tional methods in reproducing the Raman and IR spectra
intensities, as well as in dealing with the problem of mode
couplings, such as Fermi resonances. Nevertheless, this
attempt does provide an promising alternative solution
to the limitations of other existing approaches.

Unlike the whole molecule approach mentioned above,
these other approaches all employed the local mode as-
sumption of the particular molecular group. The bond
additivity model even further employed the local mode
assumption of the particular bonds. With the knowl-
edge of the symmetry of the molecular groups, the num-
ber of non-zero βq
i′j′k′ tensor elements can be signif-
icantly reduced; accordingly, the number of non-zero
α′
i′j′ elements of the symmetry group can also be sig-
niﬁcantly reduced.15,27 For example, the CH3 and CH2
groups can be treated with C3v and C2v symmetries, re-
spectively. Thus, their non-zero βq
i′j′k′ elements for the
stretching vibrational modes are reduced to 11 and 7,
respectively.15,27 There have been discussions on whether

2

the local mode treatment of the CH3 and CH2 groups
with C3v and C2v symmetries, respectively, is valid.28,29
However, such concerns have not been a serious issue be-
cause it has been generally accepted in molecular spec-
troscopy textbook that ‘...in the case of C-H stretches,
the high frequency of the local vibration of the C-H bond
tends to uncouple that motion from that of the rest of
the molecule’.30 In addition, slight deviation from C3v
symmetry of the CH3 group in actual molecules can be
treated with small perturbations, as discussed by Hirose
et al.16.

One such approach used experimental Raman depolar-
ization ratio to determine the βq
i′j′k′ ratios of the sym-
metric stretching (ss) mode of C3v and the stretching
mode of C∞v groups, because both groups have only two
independent βq
i′j′k′ terms for the ss mode under the local
group mode assumption, i.e., there is only one βq
i′j′k′ ratio
R = βaac/βccc = βbbc/βccc need to be determined.10,31
The coordinates (a, b, c) is deﬁne as in Fig.1. This di-
rect Raman polarization ratio method worked because
according to Eq.1, R = α′
cc for the ss
mode of C3v and the stretching mode of C∞v groups, and
it can be obtained from Raman experimental depolariza-
tion measurement.10 This approach has been widely used
and worked successfully because it is purely empirical,
and it solely depends on the reliability of the particular
Raman depolarization measurement.10,31,32,33,34

cc = α′

aa/α′

bb/α′

One may surmise that even though the group itself may
not strictly observe the C3v or C∞v symmetry, because
this R value is the eﬀective value obtained from the Ra-
man spectral features with the assumption of C3v or C∞v
symmetry, it should dutifully reproduce back to the same
features of the Raman spectra with the same assumption
of symmetry. Because this R value is strictly the same
for the corresponding βq
i′j′k′ ratio according to Eq. 1, it
is not hard to see that with this R value and the same
assumption of symmetry, the related features in the SFG-
VS spectral can be reproduced. This is why this approach
has worked so well for the ss mode of the C3v and the
stretching mode of the C∞v symmetry groups.10,31,32,33
However, this approach can not be applied to C2v
group, which has three instead of two independent βq
i′j′k′
terms for its ss mode.10 Furthermore, this approach does
not deal with the ratio between the βq
i′j′k′ of symmetric
and asymmetric stretching modes of the C3v molecular
group. Therefore, it can not be used to address the rel-
ative SFG intensity of the ss and as modes of the C3v
molecular group.

An useful alternative method in the SFG-VS litera-
ture is the widely used bond additivity model, which
can give βq
i′j′k′ ratios of the C3v, C2v, C∞v and other
including both of their ss and as
symmetry groups,
modes.10,11,12,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26 The bond addi-
tivity model can also be called the bond polarizability
derivative model. As Hore et al. pointed out recently,14
the key to the bond additivity model is that through
symmetry analysis the polarizability tensors of the indi-
vidual bond stretches (C∞v) are coupled to produce the
normal mode coordinate of a particular molecular group

(C3v, C2v, etc.).16,17 There are two ways to determine
the polarizability tensors ratios of the individual bond
stretches, i.e. r = βξξζ/βζζζ = βηηζ/βζζζ, where (ξηζ) is
the single bond ﬁxed coordinates with ζ as the primary
axis of the single bond. One way is through theoreti-
cal (ab initio) calculation of the Raman tensors of the
single bond,35 and the other way is through experimen-
tally measured Raman depolarization ratio, or Raman
intensity ratio between the ss and as modes,10,16,17 on
the basis that the single bond posses C∞v symmetry and
that r = α′
ζζ for a single bond according
to Eq.1.

The detailed formula and the eﬀectiveness, as well as
some limitations, of the bond polarizability model was
critically reviewed recently.10 So far, this model have
been used for study of H2O molecule at the air/water
interfaces,19,20,21,22 -CH2- groups18,24,25,26 and occasion-
ally -CH3 groups11,12,17,23 at various molecular interfaces.
The unique success of the bond additivity model has
been on H2O molecules and -CH2- groups to which direct
Raman polarization ratio method can not be applied as
mentioned above. In terms of -CH3 or other C3v groups,
the bond additivity model is essentially the same thing as
the direct raman depolarization ratio method for the ss
mode. Another unique advantage of the bond additivity
model is that it can give the βq
i′j′k′ ratio between the ss
and as modes for the C3v group.10,26 However, some in-
trinsic weakness of the bond additivity model has limited
its eﬀectiveness on interpretation of the relative intensity
of the ss and as modes in actual SFG-VS spectra. This
is discussed in detail as in the followings.

The bond additivity model uses the Raman bond po-
larizability derivative tensors α′
i′j′ and the bond moment
derivative tensors µ′
k′ to calculate βi′j′k′ tensors accord-
ing to Eq.1.10,17 In Raman and IR spectroscopy stud-
ies, the bond polarizability theory and the bond moment
theory have been used to interpret the IR and Raman
spectral intensity.36 As we have known, even though the
Raman bond polarizability derivative model have worked
well with the intensities of the ss modes, it has not been
very eﬀective on the relative intensity between the ss
and as modes of the same molecular group.36,37,38,39,40
Furthermore, the simple bond moment hypothesis, also

3

called the zero-order bond moment theory, as used in the
bond additivity model in SFG-VS, has not been success-
ful in interpretation of IR intensities.36,41,42,43,44 This is
because the simple bond moment theory essentially ne-
glects all coupling eﬀect between the single bonds even
within the same molecular group. Therefore, modiﬁed
bond moment theory which includes such and other cou-
pling eﬀects has been proposed,36 but such modiﬁed the-
ory becomes complicated by introduced many unknown
parameters in order to address the coupling terms.
In
short, these facts certainly limit the eﬀectiveness of the
bond additivity model for quantitative interpretation of
the SFG-VS spectra.

However, with all these problems, two of the impor-
tant and successful features of the bond additivity model
should not be overlooked. Firstly, the bond additivity
model rooted deeply into the concept of molecular sym-
metry analysis, which is the basis for the polarization
selection rules and has provided clear physical picture
for understanding of the polarization and orientational
dependence in SFG-VS,10,25,26 as well as all other spec-
troscopic techniques.45 Secondly, the direct Raman polar-
ization ratio method has been quantitatively successful in
many of the SFG-VS applications.10,31,32,33,34 Since a full
computational solution for quantitative interpretation of
the SFG-VS spectra is yet not within our reach as men-
tioned above, it can certainly be beneﬁcial to extend the
bond additivity model if we can use the core concept for
its successes, and try to directly address the limitations
in the consisting Raman and IR theories.

B. Failure of the bond additivity model

The failure of the bond additivity model came to
our attention in our recent study of SFG-VS spec-
interfaces of C1-C8 alcohols in
tra of vapor/alcohol
the CH stretching vibration region between 2800 to
3000cm−1.10,26 The fact has been long known that there
has been no observation of the CH3-as peak, which
should be around 2970cm−1, in the SFG-VS spectra of
the vapor/methanol interface;12,26,46,47,48,49,50,51,52 while
for longer chain alcohols (C2 − C8 alcohols), the CH3-
as peak is apparently very strong in their SFG-VS
spectra.26,48,52 Even though the bond additivity model
can seemingly explain why the longer chain alcohols
can have stronger CH3-as peak in the SFG-VS spec-
tra of their vapor/liquid interfaces than that of the va-
por/methanol interface,10 it also predict that the CH3-as
mode of methanol should be observable in the sps SFG-
VS spectrum.

Fig.2 presents the SFG-VS spectra and the calculated
polarization dependence against the CH3 orientational
angle θ from the interface normal using the bond addi-
tivity model in the ssp, ppp, and sps polarizations for
two diﬀerent experimental conﬁgurations. The SFG-VS
intensity is proportional to sec2(β)d2R(θ), and the de-
tail of calculation has been presented previously.10,26 It
is to be noted that calculation of the ss mode inten-
sity uses β2
ccc as unit, and the as mode uses β2
aca as
It is clear that for both experimental conﬁgura-
unit.

FIG. 3: SFG-VS spectra of the vapor/CH3CD2OH interface in ssp, ppp and sps polarizations with incident angles of Vis=62◦

group. The solid lines are ﬁttings with Lorentzian lineshapes.

tions, CH3-as mode around 2970cm−1 can not be ob-
served in the SFG-VS spectra. This tells us that the
missing of the CH3-as mode peak is not something ac-
cidental. With the bond additivity model, methanol has
βccc/βaca = 1.1 for its CH3 group, as calculated in Sec-
tion III. Therefore, from the calculation results in Fig.2,
CH3-as should be experimentally observable in at least
one of the three polarizations in comparison to the inten-
sities of the CH3-ss mode. Recent measurements have
determined that for vapor/methanol interface the CH3
orientation is close to the interface normal.10,50,51,53 With
this CH3 group orientation, the bond additivity model
predicted that the CH3-ss mode in the ppp polarization
can be observed in the second experimental conﬁgura-
tion (VIS=37◦ and IR=51◦), and this spectral feature
was indeed observed with the expected intensity as indi-

cated in Fig.2. This fact certainly suggests the eﬀec-
tiveness of the bond additivity model calculations for
the CH3-ss mode of methanol molecule. Accordingly,
if the bond additivity calculation is also eﬀective for the
as mode, the CH3-as mode intensity in the sps polar-
ization should be more than 1/3 of that of the CH3-ss
mode in the ssp polarization of the ﬁrst experimental
conﬁguration. However, no such CH3-as mode has been
ever observed.12,26,46,47,48,49,50,51,52 This clearly demon-
strates the failure of the bond additivity model in dealing
with the CH3-as mode, even though the intensities of the
CH3-ss and CH3-ss-Fermi modes can be quantitatively
explained as in Fig.2.

In comparison, Fig.3 presents the SFG-VS spec-
tra and the bond additivity model calculation of
vapor/CH3CD2OH interface with the incident angles

Vis=62◦ and IR=53◦ in the SFG-VS experiment. It is
clear that the CH3-as mode around 2970cm−1 in the
ppp polarization is even much bigger than the CH3-ss
mode around 2870cm−1 in the ssp polarization. This
is consistent with the bond additivity model value of
βccc/βaca = 0.30 for the CH3 group of CH3CD2OH
molecule, as calculated in Section IV. Then, why the
bond additivity model works for the CH3-as mode of
CH3CD2OH but not that of CH3OH?

Even though the bond additivity model and the direct
Raman polarization ratio method have been apparent
success in quantitative interpretation of the polarization
dependence and orientational analysis of the CH3 groups
from the SFG-VS spectra of its CH3-ss mode,10,50,51
their inability and discrepancy to address the as mode
intensities of the CH3 group in CH3CD2OH and CH3OH
molecules are certainly unpleasant, and put uncertain-
ties to these models. However, as discussed above, the
bond additivity model is still the most useful model in
obtaining the βq
i′j′k′ tensor ratios. We realized that the
eﬀectiveness of these models on the ss mode of the C3v
and the stretching mode of the C∞v symmetry lies on the
fact that their R values are empirically obtained. On the
other hand, the failures of these models also lie on the
fact that those other ratios were not set on the same em-
pirical basis. In order to address these problems and to
have better understanding of the bond additivity model,
we propose an complete empirical approach in order to
correct the failures of the bond additivity model. This
approach includes the full empirical treatment of the ss
vs. as ratios of the raman and IR tensors, in addition to
the successful empirical treatment of the ss mode.

III. BOND ADDITIVITY MODEL AND ITS
EMPIRICAL CORRECTION

In a recently review on quantitative treatment on SFG-
VS from molecular interfaces, we discussed related issues
on the bond additivity model in detail.10 We pointed out
that the original expression given by Hirose et al.16,17
needed to be corrected for some minor errors, and the
correct expressions for the C3v, C2v and C∞v groups were
presented.10 We also presented some good examples to
demonstrate the validity of the bond additivity model for
quantitative analysis of SFG-VS spectra, especially for
interpretation of the ss modes of the C3v, C2v and C∞v
groups, and we also pointed out that further detailed
examinations of this model were still needed.10

Therefore, here we shall try to keep the successful part
of the bond additivity model, which is to use the exper-
imental Raman depolarization ratio of the ss mode to
obtain the single bond Raman polarizability derivative
tensor ratio r, and try to derive the expressions for the
Raman and IR intensity expressions for the ss and as
mode of the C3v group, in order to obtain the correc-
tions factors for the α′
k′ ratios between
the ss and as modes from the experimental Raman and
IR spectra, respectively. We hope this approach can pro-
duce the corrected βq

For the stretching vibrational modes of a molecular
group with C3v symmetry, there are a single symmet-
ric mode (A1) and a doubly degenerated asymmetric
mode (E), with the following relationships between the
βi′j′k′ , α′
i′j′ and µ′
k′ tensors when there is no electronic
resonances.10,54,55

For a rotationally isotropic interface, the four asym-
metric βi′j′k′ terms, namely βaaa = −βbba = −βabb =
−βbab, are dumb tensors, which would not appear in the
non-zero elements of the 3rd rank macroscopic suscepti-
bility χijk tensors.10 Therefore, if R = βaac/βccc is known
from the direct Raman depolarization ratio method, in
addition, only the ratio βccc/βaca need to be obtained for
all useful βi′j′k′ tensor ratios.10,17 According to Eq.1, one

In order to get R and α′

When vertically linear polarized light is used for the

in the parallel polarization to the individual Raman po-
larizability derivative tensors (α′

for all molecular groups.54,56,57

in which τ is the tetrahedral angle between two single
A-B bonds, MA and MB are the atomic masses of the
atom A and B of the AB3 with C3v symmetry. Therefore,
GA1 and GE are the inverse reduced masses of the A1
and E normal modes, respectively, with the normal mode
coordinates deﬁned as,16,17,58

The molecular coordinates are deﬁned as in Fig.1.
If
natural light is used for the Raman spectra measurement,
the factor 4/45 used in Eq.11 should be 7/45, and the de-
polarization ratio becomes ρ = 6γ2/(45α2 + 7γ2).54,56,57
In this case, if one puts Eq.3 into Eq.10, because there
are only three non-zero symmetric tensors, a unique R
value (generally 1 ≤ R ≤ 4 for C3v groups, and 0 ≤ R ≤ 1
for C∞v groups) can be obtained from the symmetric
tensors through the experimental value of the Raman
depolarization ratio ρ of the C3v symmetric mode.10,13

Here the Eq.14 for obtaining R is the so called direct
Raman depolarization ratio method because R directly
satisﬁes Eq.2 according to Eq.1.10,31

However, since the raman depolarization ratio for the
asymmetric mode ρasym = 3/4 is always a constant, no
knowledge of the asymmetric tensors can be learned from
the direct Raman depolarization ratio method. There-
fore, one now have to employ the bond additivity model
to make such connection through Eq.11.

In the bond additivity model, the single bond prop-
erty is used to calculate the property of the whole group.
Following Hirose et al.’s formulation,17,58 the Raman po-
larizability derivative of the single bond can be related
to the following three non-zero tensor elements with the
following relationship,

∂αξξ
∂∆ζ

=

∂αηη
∂∆ζ

= r

∂αζζ
∂∆ζ

(15)

in which ζ is the primary axis of the single bond coordi-
nates, and the stretching vibration displacement ∆ζ from
its equilibrium position is along the single bond. Gener-
ally, for the single bond, 0 ≤ r ≤ 1.10 This is to say, the
single bond is treated with C∞v symmetry. In the bond
additivity model,10,16,17,58 we deﬁne the following,

QA1 = (∆r1 + ∆r2 + ∆r3)/(3GA1 )1/2
QE,a = (2∆r1 − ∆r2 − ∆r3)/(6GE)1/2
QE,b = (∆r2 − ∆r3)/(2GE)1/2

in which ∆ri is the bond displacement vector along the
direction of the ith bond, with the C3v coordinates de-
ﬁned as in Fig.1. Then according to the bond additivity
model, we have the following expressions for the α′
i′j′ and
µ′

k′ tensors of the C3v group.

It is to be noted that the above expressions is de-
rived with the assumption that the C3v group closely
assumes a normal tetrahedral structure. For most the
CH3 groups under our investigation, this is generally a
good assumption. In order to simplify calculations, here
we use cos τ = −1/3, which is exact for the normal tetra-
hedral angle τ ≈ 109.5◦. Therefore, with MC = 12 and
MH = 1, we have GA1 /GE = 37/40.

In order to make the bond additivity model work, the
single bond value of r need to be determined. The r value
can be determined from computations,35 or from Raman
experimental measurement.10,16,17,58. With above α′

expressions put into Eq.10 and Eq.11, we have the fol-
lowing two expressions which can each produce an r value

One would naturally expect that Eq.16 and Eq.17 (or
Eq.22) would end up with the same r value from Ra-
man experiment measurement on the same molecule.17
However, experimental data have shown that it has gen-
erally not been the case. Therefore, in the bond addi-
tivity model, Eq.16 and Eq.17 can not be used at the
same time. This fact has not been clearly recognized
since the ﬁrst derivation of the bond additivity model by
Hirose et al.17 Now the question is whether one of them
can be used, or both are not good at all. As we have
known that the direct Raman polarization ratio method
using Eq.14 involves only with the symmetric Raman
tensors of the group, and it has been widely and success-
fully employed.10,31,32,33,34 As has been shown before, the
bond additivity model with the single bond r value from
Eq.16 is equivalent to direct raman depolarization ratio
method with Eq.14.10 Therefore, it is reasonable to stick
with the r value obtained from Eq.16, and then try to
experimentally correct the α′
ac ratio with Eq.18 by
using the r value obtained from Eq.16. We surmise such
correction directly from the Raman depolarization ratio
measurement and the Raman intensity measurement can
correct the value for the asymmetric tensors, and in the
meantime keep the relationship between the symmetric
tensors intact.

ratios back into Eq.8, the corrected βccc/βaca ratio thus
obtained can be used to address the failures of the bond
additivity model discussed in Section IIB. If we can do
so, it shall put the uncertain parameters used in the bond
additivity model on a solid empirical basis. In the next
section we shall used the well established IR and Ra-
man data of liquid CH3OH and CH3CD2OH molecules
in the previous literatures to demonstrate how this em-
pirical approach to the bond additivity model works. The
terms and expressions for the C2v groups are listed in the
Appendix.

IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

A. Bond Additivity Model Results

The Raman depolarization ratio for the ss mode of
the CH3 group in CH3OH and CH3CH2OH molecules
in bulk liquid at the room temperature measured with
polarized laser light are ρ = 0.014 and ρ = 0.053,
respectively.56 Photoacoustic stimulated Raman mea-
surement of CH3CH2OH, CH3CD2OH and CD3CH2OH
in the gas phase gave ρ = 0.060 ± 0.015 for all three
molecules.59 These values are in good agreement with
each other. Because the previous Raman experiment
claimed to have higher accuracy (error of ρ was claimed
to be 0.0007), and was measured with bulk liquids, here
we adopt the value ρ = 0.053 for CH3CD2OH in this
work. From Eq.14 and Eq.16, the R and r values for the
CH3 group in CH3OH and CH3CH2OH molecules can be
directly calculated.

Therefore, for CH3OH, R = 1.7 and r = 0.28; while

for CH3CH2OH, R = 3.4, and r = 0.026.

Using the two r values, the following values can be
obtained from the uncorrected bond additivity model for
the CH3 group in CH3OH and CH3CH2OH, using the
three equations Eq.19-Eq.21.

For CH3OH, with r = 0.28, ωsym = 2836cm−1 and

ωasym = 2987cm−1, we have,

= 2.2 ;

= 0.48 ;

= 1.1

In order to make empirical corrections of the α′

cc/α′
aa
and µ′
a ratios in the bond additivity model, the rel-
ative intensities of the CH3-ss and CH3-as peaks in the
Raman and IR spectra need to be known.

A detailed band ﬁtting of the Raman spectra from a
polarized Raman measurement of liquid CH3OH at 298K
were reported by Griﬃths et al. in 1972.56 The integrated
band intensity of the four C-H stretching bands thus ob-
tained are listed in Table I. The intensity ratio between
the CH3-ss and CH3-as is thus 1.00/0.20=5.00, which is
used in Eq.18 to calculate the corresponding α′

cc/α′

ac.

A detailed band ﬁtting of the IR spectra of liquid
CH3OH at 298K were reported by Bertie et al.
in
1997.60 The integrated band intensity of the C-H stretch-
ing bands are also listed in Table I. It is to be noted that
the Raman and IR band positions and band widths (Ta-
ble I) are in very good agreement with each other. The
intensity ratio between the CH3-ss and CH3-as is thus
0.60/0.70=0.86, which is used in Eq.9 to calculate the
corresponding µ′

a value.

The Raman and IR spectra of 12 kind of deuterated
ethanol molecule were systematically studies by Perchard
and Josien in 1968.61 Fig.4 shows the Raman (mea-
sured with polarized light) and IR spectra of pure liq-
uid CH3CD2OH at 300K reproduced from Perchard and
Josien’s paper. With the reproduced spectra, we per-
formed band ﬁtting and listed the integrated band in-
tensities in Table II. therefore, the intensity ratios be-
tween the CH3-ss and CH3-as of the Raman and IR spec-
tra are 0.36/0.67=0.54, and 0.20/1.00=0.20, respectively.
Comparing with the values for CH3OH above, it is clear
that the relative CH3-as band Raman and IR intensities
are many times stronger for CH3CD2OH than those for
CH3OH.

Table III summarizes the values of R, r, βccc/βaca,
α′
cc/α′
a in the uncorrected and corrected bond
additivity model. It is easy to see that the biggest correc-
tion is the µ′
c/µ′
a value for CH3OH. According to the sim-
ple bond moment theory, µ′
a = 0.48 for both CH3OH
and CH3CD2OH, i.e.
the IR intensity for the CH3-as
mode should be about 2(1/0.48)2 = 8.7 times of that
for the CH3-ss mode. However, experimentally they are
about 1.2 and 5 for CH3OH and CH3CD2OH, respec-
tively. Such big diﬀerence between these two molecules
can be attributed to the fact that there is much stronger
inﬂuence on the CH3 group stretching vibrations by the
O-H group in CH3OH than in CH3CD2OH.

It is interesting to see that r = 0.026 for CH3CD2OH,
while r = 0.28 for CH3OH. According to the deﬁni-
tion of r in Eq.15, r = 0 means that each bond can
be pictured as a perfect rod. Therefore, the value of r
may be used to correlate the coupling between the dif-
ferent bonds in the same group, and the perturbation
of the bonds in the group by the connecting molecu-
lar groups. The CH3 group in CH3OH is likely to be
much more strongly perturbed by the directly connect-
ing O-H group, than the CH3 group in CH3CD2OH by
the directly connecting CD2 and the indirectly connect-
ing O-H groups. The same eﬀect as in CH3OH can
also be expected for acetone and acetonitrile molecules,
where the CH3 groups are directly connected to the -
C=O and -C≡N groups, respectively.
Similarly, the
longer chain alcohols should be similar to CH3CD2OH.
Therefore,
it is not coincidental that the asymmetric
C-H stretching mode in the SFG-VS spectra from the
vapor/acetone and vapor/acetonitrile interfaces has not
been observed,23,62,63,64 while for the longer chain alco-
hols it has been experimentally observed.5,26,48

If we put I Raman

asym = 5.0 for CH3OH into Eq.17,
we have r = 0.24 for 0 ≤ r ≤ 1; while if we put
I Raman
asym = 0.54 for CH3CD2OH into Eq.17, there
sys
is no solution of r for 0 ≤ r ≤ 1 at all. This clearly shows
that Eq.16 and Eq.17 do not generally give consistent r
values, and certainly they can not be held true at the
same time.

Now, with the corrected βccc/βaca value for CH3OH,
the fact of missing CH3-as mode in SFG-VS from
vapor/CH3OH interface can be readily addressed. From

the calculated intensities in Fig.2 with Vis=62◦ and
IR=53◦ experimental conﬁguration, I sps
CH3−ss ≈
1/2.5 with the uncorrected bond additivity model value
βccc/βaca = 1.1, and with the known orientation an-
gle θ ≈ 0 from previous studies.50,51,53 Now, with the
corrected value βccc/βaca = 3.8, the I sps
CH3−as/I ssp
CH3−ss
ratio should be (3.8/1.1)2 = 11.9 times smaller,
i.e.,
I sps
CH3−as/I ssp
It is easy to see that such
a small I sps
CH3−ss is below the noise
level and its spectral feature can not be observed in the
SFG-VS spectra. Convincingly, using above approach,
inspection of the IR and Raman spectra of liquid ace-
tone and acetonitrile also indicated that the CH3-as vs.
CH3-ss intensity ratio values are signiﬁcantly smaller
than the values calculated from the simple bond addi-
tivity model for their SFG-VS spectra from vapor/liquid
interfaces.23,62,63,64

It is interesting to see that the correction for the
βccc/βaca value is very small
for CH3CD2OH, even
though the corrections for α′
ac and µ′
a are not so
small separately. These two corrections happened to can-
cel each other when used to calculate βccc/βaca with Eq.8.
Using this ratio, the SFG-VS spectra of CH3CD2OH can
be well interpreted just as with the uncorrected bond
additivity model.10 However, it is to be noted that the
success of the former is with ﬁrm empirical basis, and
the success of the latter is nevertheless coincidental. We
have performed measurements on the SFG-VS spectra in
diﬀerent incident angles for the vapor/ethanol interface,
and analysis show that with the βi′j′k′ tensor ratios ob-
tained here, all spectra as well as the spectra interference
eﬀects, can be quantitatively interpreted, and detailed
molecular orientation analysis is also possible.34

According to above discussion, the success of the cor-
rected bond additivity model is evident. This success
indicates that the failure of the bond additivity model
discussed in Section IIB can be quantitatively corrected
with the empirical approach as demonstrated here. How-
ever, we have to caution that this success is purely empir-
ical, and may not be as general as it seems before further
examinations being made. Even though it is undoubtedly
an advancement from the simple bond additivity model,
there are reasons this empirical approach may fail.

Because the correction for the bond additivity model
used the Raman and IR spectra in the liquid phase, the
success of this correction undoubtedly indicates that the
CH3 group of these molecules under studying are not sig-
niﬁcantly diﬀerent as in the liquid bulk phases or at the
interfaces. This may only be true for the generally ‘rigid’
C-H stretching vibrations which is usually not greatly
perturbed and the assumption of local motion is generally
valid. But this may not be true for the less ‘rigid’ molec-
ular groups. Based on the successful treatment with the
CH3 groups, we may assume that the same treatment on
the similarly ‘rigid’ NH3 and CH2 groups is also going
to work. If this approach fails to quantitatively interpret
the SFG-VS spectra for a particular molecular group, one
may try to consider the possibility that this group might
have been very diﬀerently perturbed in the bulk phase
from at the interface.

One clear advantage of this empirical approach is that

the problem of the Fermi resonance and combinational
mode couplings is automatically addressed through the
empirical correction. As we have known, to assess the ef-
fects of such accidental resonances and couplings can be a
very diﬃcult problem in ab initio calculations. Therefore,
the empirical treatment discussed here may provide a way
to quantitatively test the whole molecule approach.14
For example, one direct may is to try to use the whole
molecule approach to calculate the polarizability tensors
of the CH3 group in the CH3OH and CH3CD2OH, and
compare the results directly with the IR, Raman and
SFG-VS data. Provided with successful applications to
a series of clearly studied molecular systems, one may
expect that in the future ab initio computation can be
generally applied for quantitative interpretation of non-
linear spectroscopy.

V. CONCLUSION

In summary, we discussed a total empirical approach
with symmetry analysis to quantitatively interpret ob-
served SFG-VS spectra from molecular interfaces.
In
such an approach, the Raman and IR tensor ratios are
directly calculated from Raman and IR spectral measure-
ments using a certain correction procedure to the bond
additivity model. This approach is tested with the SFG-
VS spectra from vapor/CH3OH and vapor/CH3CD2OH
interfaces.

There have been few attempts to use Raman and IR
spectra in the condensed phase to quantitatively inter-
pret SFG-VS spectra from molecular interfaces in detail.
It has been demonstrated that the bond additivity model
has been successful in quantitative interpretation of SFG-
VS of the CH3 and CH2 as well as H2O groups for their ss
modes,10 but it has not been as successful with the as of
these molecules or molecular groups. Through analysis
of the problem we understood the empirical basis for the
successes of the bond additivity model. So we proposed
to treat the failures of the bond additivity model with a
complete empirical approach. In this report we success-
fully demonstrated with two examples that the empirical
corrections to the bond additivity model can successfully
interpret what the simple bond additivity model failed.
This development can become a new addition to the ex-
isting methodologies in quantitative SFG-VS studies.10
We believe that this empirical approach can provide new
understanding of the eﬀectiveness and limitations of the
bond additivity model, and this report also provided a
practical roadmap for its application in SFG-VS studies
of molecular interfaces.

APPENDIX: Terms and expressions for C2v group
corrections

With the empirical approach derived and tested for the
C3v groups, similar approach can be taken for the C2v
groups. For them, bond additivity model has to be used
to obtain necessary βi′j′k′ tensor ratios for quantitative
calculation.18,19,25,26

If the ﬁxed coordinates system of the AB2 group with
C2v symmetry is deﬁned with c axis as the symmetry
axis, ac plane as the A-B-A molecular plane, and b is
perpendicular to the molecular plane, then there are two
A-B stretching vibrational mode with A1 mode as the
symmetric stretching (ss) vibrational mode, and B1 mode
the asymmetric (as) mode.10,54,55 The non-zero elements
for the stretching vibrational modes are as the followings.

For the A1 (symmetric) mode:

SFG-VS
Raman:
IR:

βaac = Raβccc ;
aa = Raα′
α′
cc ;
µ′
c

βbbc = Rbβccc (28)
bb = Rbα′
α′
(29)
cc
(30)

where Ra and Rb are the two βi′j′k′ elements ratios.

For the B1 (asymmetric) mode:

Therefore, Eq.9 for IR intensity of the C2v group be-

comes,

Eq.10-Eq.13

cannot be
alone
and Eq.14
used to determine both Ra and Rb values. Therefore,
bond additivity model has to be employed.

For the single A-B bond treated with C∞v symmetry,
Eq.15 is generally assumed valid, and the deﬁnition of a0
and m0 of the single bond is the same as deﬁnes above.
For the C2v group AB2 with the A-B-A angle as τ , we
have the following:

GA1 =

GB1 =

1 + cos τ
MA
1 − cos τ
MA

+

+

1
MB

in which MA and MB are the atomic masses of the atom
A and B; GA1 and GB1 are the inverse reduced masses
of the A1 and B1 normal modes, respectively, with the
normal mode coordinates deﬁned as,16,17,58

QA1 = (∆r1 + ∆r2)/(2GA1)1/2
QB1 = (∆r1 − ∆r2)/(2GB1 )1/2

(35)

11

Then the bond additivity model gives the following

expressions of the non-zero α′

i′j′ and µ′

k′ tensors.

For the A1 (symmetric) mode:

with the r values calculated from the experimentally ob-
tained Raman depolarization ratio ρ of the ss mode of
the AB2 group using the following equation.

aa = a0[sin2(τ /2) + r cos2(τ /2)](2GA1 )

bb = a0r(2GA1 )

c = m0 cos(τ /2)(2GA1 )

Therefore, the bond additivity gives the following βi′j′k′
tensor ratios.10

ρ =

(37)

Following the example of the C3v group above, the pro-
cedure to make correction for the bond additivity model
is as the following. First to use Eq.37 to obtain r value.
Then the Ra and Rb values can be obtained using this r
value. In order to calculate Rc/a, one need to use Eq.8
with the empirically corrected α′
cc/α′
a values.
c/µ′
The µ′
a value can be obtained using Eq.34. Then the
α′
cc/α′
ac value can be obtained by put the r value and the
bond additivity model expressions for α′
i′j′ tensors above
into Eq.11 to derive a equation similar to Eq.18.

ac and µ′

c/µ′

This correction procedure is certainly worth to be
tested for interpretation of SFG-VS data of typical C2v
molecules or molecular groups at interfaces. For example,
at the air/water and organic/water interfaces, so far the
asymmetric stretching mode of the C2v water molecule
has not been clearly identiﬁed yet.19,21,22 Another exam-
ple is that the intensity ratio between CH2-ss and CH2-as
has been widely used to interpret CH2 group orienta-
tional changes at molecular and polymer interfaces.65

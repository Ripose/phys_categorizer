Neutral molecules, isolated in the gas-phase, can be prepared in a long-lived excited state and
stored in a trap. The long observation time aﬀorded by the trap can then be exploited to measure
the radiative lifetime of this state by monitoring the temporal decay of the population in the trap.
This method is demonstrated here and used to benchmark the Einstein A-coeﬃcients in the Meinel
system of OH. A pulsed beam of vibrationally excited OH radicals is Stark decelerated and loaded
into an electrostatic quadrupole trap. The radiative lifetime of the upper Λ-doublet component
of the X 2Π3/2, v = 1, J = 3/2 level is determined as 59.0 ± 2.0 ms, in good agreement with the
calculated value of 57.7 ± 1.0 ms.

Infrared absorption and emission spectroscopy has a
long and rich history in the development and application
of molecular physics. Absorption and emission of infrared
radiation is an important diagnostic means in determin-
ing the presence and concentration of molecular species in
various environments, ranging from plasmas and ﬂames
to the earth’s atmosphere and interstellar space. A quan-
titative analysis of these observations relies on a detailed
knowledge of the Einstein A-coeﬃcients that characterize
the spontaneous emission rates. These A-coeﬃcients can
generally be inferred from absorption measurements, pro-
vided the (line-integrated) number density and the tem-
perature of the absorbing species are accurately known.
The unstable nature of many chemically highly relevant
molecules severely limits the accuracy of this approach
for these species, however. The most direct and gener-
ally applicable route to accurately determining the A-
coeﬃcients is to measure the radiative lifetimes of in-
dividual ro-vibrational levels. Molecules isolated in the
gas-phase and at low densities are needed for this, as
interactions with a medium and quenching by collisions
have to be avoided. The preferred way to measure the
radiative lifetime is to prepare molecules in the quan-
tum state of interest, and to measure the state-speciﬁc
population as a function of time. The problem with this
approach is that infrared radiative lifetimes are typically
in the millisecond to second range, much longer than the
observation times that are commonly available in experi-
ments. Ingenious schemes have been developed that nev-
ertheless enable a measurement of long radiative lifetimes
of neutral molecules in a molecular beam [1, 2]. Only for
lifetimes up to a few milliseconds it has been possible to
measure the population decay directly [3].

For charged particles, the greatly enhanced observa-
tion times that became available when traps were de-
veloped opened up the possibility to directly measure

radiative lifetimes of metastable states [4]. For neutral
atoms and neutrons, trapping has been used to directly
measure long lifetimes as well [5]. Methods to conﬁne
neutral gas-phase molecules in magnetic [6], optical [7],
and electrostatic traps [8] for times up to seconds have
recently been developed. In this Letter we report on the
ﬁrst direct measurement of the infrared radiative life-
time of a vibrationally excited trapped molecule. By
measuring the temporal decay of the population of OH
(X 2Π3/2, v = 1, J = 3/2) radicals in an electrostatic
trap, an accurate value for the A-coeﬃcient of the fun-
damental 1 − 0 band of OH is obtained.

The infrared radiative properties of the OH radical
are of particular importance. Vibrationally excited OH
(X 2Π, v ≤ 9) radicals, produced in the upper atmo-
sphere via the reactive depletion of ozone [9, 10], are
responsible for the near-infrared night-time air-glow [11].
Recently, this OH Meinel band emission has also been
observed from artiﬁcial aurora at higher altitudes, of-
fering new possibilities to study ionospheric interactions
[12]. OH vibrational emission has also been observed
from stellar and interstellar space [13]. The so-called
‘prompt emission’ in the 1 − 0 band of the OH radical
(around 3.3 µm), produced by photodissociation of wa-
ter, is used as a tracer for water produced in comets [14].
The radiative lifetimes of the vibrational states of OH
(X 2Π) are essential for a quantitative interpretation of
all these observations, and have therefore received consid-
erable experimental and theoretical attention. Over the
years, the values have scattered over a wide range and
have only slowly converged [15]. The most recent val-
ues for the lifetimes, based on experimental absorption
line intensities, are given in the HITRAN 2004 database
[16]. For the X 2Π3/2, v = 1, J = 3/2 level of OH, this
database gives a lifetime of 56.6 ms with an error of 10-
20%.

FIG. 1: Scheme of the experimental setup. A pulsed beam
of OH (v = 0) radicals is produced via photodissociation
(193 nm) of HNO3 molecules seeded in Xe. Prior to entering
the decelerator, part of the OH radicals are prepared in the
v = 1 state by Franck-Condon pumping via the A 2Σ+ state
(upper left). OH radicals in the J = 3/2 level of both the
v = 0 and v = 1 vibrational states of the X 2Π3/2 electronic
ground state are Stark decelerated and subsequently loaded
into the electrostatic trap. Molecules in the trap are state-
selectively detected by imaging the laser induced ﬂuorescence
onto a PMT.

The experiments are performed in a molecular beam
deceleration and trapping machine that is schematically
shown in Figure 1. The same setup has been used re-
cently for the experimental demonstration of the elec-
trostatic trapping of OH (X 2Π3/2, v = 0) radicals [17].
A pulsed beam of OH radicals with a mean velocity of
360 m/s is produced via ArF-laser dissociation of HNO3,
seeded in Xe, near the oriﬁce of a pulsed solenoid valve.
In the experiments, the population in the J = 3/2 rota-
tional level of the v = 0 and v = 1 vibrational states of
the X 2Π3/2 electronic ground state is of relevance. Dur-
ing the expansion, most of the OH radicals cool down to
the ro-vibrational ground state v = 0, J = 3/2. Just af-
ter the expansion region, approximately 15% of the OH
(v = 0) radicals are promoted to the X 2Π3/2, v = 1
state by Franck-Condon pumping via the A 2Σ+ state at
282 nm [18]. This optical pumping scheme is shown in
the upper left of Figure 1. In the presence of an electric
ﬁeld, the upper Λ-doublet components of the J = 3/2
levels split into a low-ﬁeld seeking MJ Ω = −3/4 and
a MJ Ω = −9/4 component. Only OH radicals in the
J = 3/2, MJΩ = −9/4 component of either vibrational
state are Stark decelerated and subsequently loaded into
the quadrupole trap.

After passage through a 2 mm diameter skimmer, the
beam enters the deceleration chamber, and is focussed
into the Stark decelerator by a short hexapole. The
operation principles of the hexapole, Stark decelerator,
and quadrupole trap are given elsewhere [17]. Brieﬂy,
the Stark decelerator exploits the interaction of polar

2

molecules with time-varying electric ﬁelds to reduce the
velocity of the molecular beam in a stepwise fashion. The
1.18 m long decelerator consists of an array of 108 elec-
tric ﬁeld stages, that are placed 11 mm apart. Each ﬁeld
stage consists of two 6 mm diameter parallel electrodes,
centered 10 mm apart that are oriented perpendicular to
the molecular beam axis. Adjacent electric ﬁeld stages
are rotated by 90◦ with respect to each other to provide
a 4 × 4 mm2 transverse area for the beam to pass. When
at the appropriate times a voltage diﬀerence of 40 kV is
applied between the electrodes of the electric ﬁeld stages,
OH radicals in the J = 3/2, MJΩ = −9/4 component are
decelerated from 360 m/s to 20 m/s. The Stark shifts of
the v = 0 and v = 1 states of OH are very similar [19],
and molecules in both vibrational states are simultane-
ously decelerated and loaded into the quadrupole trap
with equal eﬃciency. The trap consists of a ring electrode
and two hyperbolic end-caps, and is located 21 mm down-
stream from the decelerator. The trap is mounted in a
separate diﬀerentially pumped vacuum chamber, where
the pressure does not exceed 2 × 10−9 mbar under op-
erating conditions. Depending on the voltages that are
applied to the trap electrodes, either a last deceleration
stage or a (nearly) symmetric 500 mK deep potential well
can be created. The OH radicals enter the trap through
a 4 mm diameter hole in the ﬁrst end-cap, and come, ap-
proximately 8 ms after their production, to a standstill
near the center of the trap. At this time, the voltages
on the trap electrodes are switched to conﬁne the OH
radicals in the potential well. The density of OH rad-
icals at the center of the trap is measured using laser
induced ﬂuorescence (LIF) detection schemes, shown in
the lower right of Figure 1. The population of the OH
radicals in the v = 0, J = 3/2 and v = 1, J = 3/2 levels
is state-selectively probed by inducing the Q1(1) transi-
tions of the A 2Σ+, v = 1 ← X 2Π, v = 0 band around
282 nm and the A 2Σ+, v = 0 ← X 2Π, v = 1 band
around 346 nm, respectively. The oﬀ-resonant ﬂuores-
cence around 313 nm (when probing v = 0) and 308 nm
(when probing v = 1) is imaged through a 6 mm diame-
ter opening in the second end-cap onto a photomultiplier
tube (PMT). Stray light from the laser is largely avoided
by using light baﬄes and is suppressed by optical ﬁlters
in front of the PMT.

In Figure 2, the LIF signal of the trapped cloud of OH
radicals in the v = 0, J = 3/2 level (upper curve) and
in the v = 1, J = 3/2 level (lower curve) is shown as a
function of the storage time t. The trapping potential is
switched on at t = 0 ms. The experiment runs at a rep-
etition rate of 5 Hz to allow for a maximum observation
time of (almost) 200 ms in the trap. On this time-scale,
OH radicals in the v = 0 state mainly leave the trap
via collisions with background gas; both elastic and in-
elastic collisions with the thermal background gas trans-
fer an amount of kinetic energy to the OH radicals that
largely exceeds the trap depth. From a separate series of

measurements, running the apparatus at lower repetition
rates while maintaining the same background pressure, a
1/e trap lifetime of 1.3 ± 0.1 s is deduced. The popula-
tion of trapped OH radicals in the v = 1 state, on the
other hand, is mainly depleted via spontaneous emission
to the v = 0 state, in addition to collisions with back-
ground gas. The observed exponentially decaying curve
therefore almost directly reﬂects the radiative lifetime of
the X 2Π3/2, v = 1, J = 3/2 level of OH. From a series of
measured decay curves, taking carefully the baseline and
the signal-to-noise ratio of the LIF signal into account, an
exponential decay time of 56.4 ± 1.9 ms is deduced. The
inherent trap lifetime can be assumed to be identical for
OH radicals in the v = 0 and v = 1 vibrational states, as
the total collision cross-sections with thermal background
gas will be very similar for OH in either one of the vibra-
tional states. Under this assumption, a radiative lifetime
τ for OH radicals in the upper Λ-doublet component of
the X 2Π3/2, v = 1, J = 3/2 level of τ = 59.0 ± 2.0 ms is
obtained. We veriﬁed that the re-population of the v = 1
state in the trap via cascading spontaneous emission from
higher vibrational states is negligible in our experiment.
OH radicals in the v = 1, J = 3/2 level that are con-
ﬁned in the trap undergo infrared spontaneous emission
to the v = 0 state, following the selection rules of the
electric dipole allowed transitions in the presence of an
electric ﬁeld. The molecules can make a transition to
all MJ Ω components of the J = 1/2, J = 3/2 and
J = 5/2 rotational levels of the X 2Π, v = 0 electronic
ground state. Of these, only molecules that end up
in the MJ Ω = −15/4, −9/4 and −3/4 components of
the J = 5/2 level or in the MJ Ω = −9/4 and −3/4
component of the J = 3/2 level are (partially) recap-
tured and conﬁned in the trap. In Figure 3, the excita-

tion spectrum of trapped OH (v = 0) radicals is shown
that is recorded 5 ms (lower curve) and 72 ms (upper
curve) after switching on of the trap. The detection laser
is scanned over the Q1(1) and Q1(2) transitions of the
A2Σ+, v = 1 ← X 2Π3/2, v = 0 band, probing the pop-
ulation in the v = 0, J = 3/2 and v = 0, J = 5/2 levels,
respectively. Initially, the trapped OH v = 0 radicals ex-
clusively reside in the J = 3/2 level, the only rotational
state that is selected by the Stark decelerator. After
72 ms of trapping, a small but signiﬁcant population of
OH radicals in the v = 0, J = 5/2 level is detected in
the trap. In the central inset of Figure 3, the accumu-
lation over time of the trapped OH (v = 0, J = 5/2)
radicals is shown. The expected exponential growth of
the population in the J = 5/2 level, as deduced from
the measurements shown in Figure 2, is shown as well.
The relative population of trapped OH radicals in the
v = 0, J = 3/2 and v = 0, J = 5/2 levels is also con-
sistent with the expectations. An overall factor of about
20 is expected, based on the initial relative population
of v = 0 and v = 1 in the trap and the H¨onl-London
factor for ﬂuorescence from the v = 1, J = 3/2 to the
v = 0, J = 5/2 level, in combination with the larger size
of the trapped cloud of J = 5/2, e.g. the reduced overlap
with the detection laser.

The radiative properties of the OH radical can be cal-
culated from its dipole moment function and the poten-
tial energy curve. The radiative lifetime τ of the upper
Λ-doublet component (of f (+) parity) of the X 2Π3/2(v =

1, J = 3/2) level of OH is given by

structure constant, ωf i the frequency of the emitted pho-
ton, c the speed of light, and e the elementary charge. In
the calculation of the initial (|ii) and ﬁnal (|f i) states, Λ-
type doubling and spin-orbit, spin-rotation, and rotation-
vibration coupling is taken into account. The sum over
ﬁnal states includes all F1 and F2 states with J ≤ 5/2.
The X 2Π potential energy curve and the r-dependent
dipole moment µ are obtained from an internally con-
tracted multireference conﬁguration interaction calcula-
tion with the MOLPRO [20] program package. Special rel-
ativistic eﬀects are taken into account by using Douglas-
Kroll one-electron integrals. The molecular orbitals are
obtained from a 1-5σ, 1-2π complete active space self con-
sistent ﬁeld calculation, employing an augmented corre-
lation consistent polarized valence 6-zeta (aug-cc-pV6Z)
one-electron basis set. The r-dependent spin orbit cou-
plings are obtained in a similar calculation employing
an uncontracted aug-cc-pVQZ basis. The Λ-type dou-
bling parameters are taken from spectroscopic observa-
tions [21]. The result that is obtained for the radiative
lifetime is τ = 57.7 ms, in good agreement with the
experimentally determined value. As the computed ro-
vibrational energy levels agree with experiments to better
than 0.02% and as our dipole moments agree with previ-
ous high level ab initio calculations [22] to about 0.7%,
we estimate the error in τ to be about 1 ms.

In this Letter, we report the ﬁrst direct measurement
of the quantum-state speciﬁc infrared radiative lifetime
of a trapped molecule. The technique reported here
can generally be applied to directly measure lifetimes
of metastable states of neutral molecules up to seconds,
with an unprecedented accuracy. A requirement is that
it must be possible to conﬁne the molecules in the de-
sired quantum state in a trap. The molecules can be
prepared in the metastable state prior to deceleration
and trapping, as reported here. Alternatively, they can
ﬁrst be trapped in the quantum-state that is best suited
for it, and preparation of the desired metastable state
can then be performed inside the trap. By recording
the decay of the population of vibrationally excited OH
(X 2Π3/2, v = 1, J = 3/2) radicals in an electrostatic
quadrupole trap, the radiative lifetime of this level is de-
termined as 59.0 ± 2.0 ms, in good agreement with the
theoretically predicted value of 57.7 ± 1.0 ms. This pro-
vides a benchmark for the Einstein A-coeﬃcients in the
Meinel system of OH. This is of particular importance
in, for instance, combustion, atmospheric science and in
astrophysics.

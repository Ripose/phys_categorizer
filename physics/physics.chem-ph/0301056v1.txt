Abstract

Core-valence basis sets for the alkali and alkaline earth metals Li, Be, Na, Mg, K, and Ca are

proposed. The basis sets are validated by calculating spectroscopic constants of a variety of di-

atomic molecules involving these elements. Neglect of (3s, 3p) correlation in K and Ca compounds

will lead to erratic results at best, and chemically nonsensical ones if chalcogens or halogens are

present. The addition of low-exponent p functions to the K and Ca basis sets is essential for

smooth convergence of molecular properties. Inclusion of inner-shell correlation is important for

accurate spectroscopic constants and binding energies of all the compounds. In basis set extrapo-

lation/convergence calculations, the explicit inclusion of alkali and alkaline earth metal subvalence

correlation at all steps is essential for K and Ca, strongly recommended for Na, and optional for

Li and Mg, while in Be compounds, an additive treatment in a separate ‘core correlation’ step

is probably suﬃcient. Consideration of (1s) inner-shell correlation energy in ﬁrst-row elements

requires inclusion of (2s, 2p) ‘deep core’ correlation energy in K and Ca for consistency. The latter

requires special CCVnZ ‘deep core correlation’ basis sets. For compounds involving Ca bound to

electronegative elements, additional d functions in the basis set are strongly recommended. For

optimal basis set convergence in such cases, we suggest the sequence CV(D+3d)Z, CV(T+2d)Z,

CV(Q+d)Z, and CV5Z on calcium.

INTRODUCTION

The rate-determining step in accurate wavefunction ab initio calculations is the determi-

nation of the correlation energy. Moderately reliable methods like CCSD (coupled cluster

with all single and double substitutions[1]) have theoretical CPU time scalings ∝ n2N 4 ,

where n and N represent the numbers of electrons and basis functions, respectively. For the

CCSD(T) (i.e., CCSD with a quasiperturbative estimate of the eﬀect of connected triple

substitutions[2]) method — which has been termed the “gold standard of quantum chem-

istry” (T. H. Dunning) — the corresponding scaling is ∝ n3N 4.

For this reason, the idea of only including the ‘chemically relevant’ valence electrons in the

correlation problem and constraining the inner-shell or ‘core’ orbitals to be doubly occupied

gained currency early on. Bauschlicher et al.[3] were the ﬁrst to propose a partitioning of

the inner-shell correlation energy into a core-core (CC) component — involving excitations

exclusively out of the inner-shell orbitals — and a core-valence (CV) component — involving

simultaneous excitations out of the valence and inner-shell orbitals. While, at least in

elements with a large core-valence gap (see below), the CC component can be expected to

roughly cancel between a molecule and its separated atoms, the CV component may aﬀect

chemically relevant molecular properties to some degree.

Over time, it has become recognized that the inclusion of inner-shell correlation — even

in ﬁrst-row systems — is important for accurate binding energies (e.g.

[4, 5]), molecular

geometries (e.g.[4]), and harmonic frequencies (e.g.

[4]). The treatment of inner-shell cor-

relation requires special basis sets which not only have additional radial ﬂexibility, but also

include ‘hard’ or ‘tight’ (i.e., high-exponent) d,f ,. . .

functions in order to cover angular

correlation from the inner-shell orbitals. Special basis sets of this type have been developed,

such as the cc-pCVnZ (correlation consistent polarized core-valence n-tuple zeta) basis sets

of Woon and Dunning[6] for B–Ne, the MT (Martin-Taylor[7]) and MTsmall[8] basis sets

for Li–Ar, the rather small G3large basis set[9] of Pople and coworkers for the main group

elements of the ﬁrst three rows, and very recently the cc-pwCVnZ (i.e. core-valence weighted

cc-pCVnZ) basis sets of Peterson and Dunning[10] for B–Ne and Al–Ar.

While the CC+CV contribution to absolute correlation energies may rival or exceed the

valence contribution, its diﬀerential contribution to the molecular binding energy is gener-

ally small compared to the SCF and valence correlation contributions (typically less than

2

1% for 1st-row systems). For that reason — as well as the formidable cost of core corre-

lation calculations — computational thermochemistry schemes (e.g. G3 theory[9], W1/W2

theory[8, 11]) that account for inner-shell correlation generally treat the latter as a small

additive contribution obtained with a relatively compact core correlation basis set. (The

ﬁnding[8] that connected triple substitutions are surprisingly important for CV contribu-

tions ensures that the core correlation step often is the rate-determining one for benchmark

thermochemistry calculations, particularly beyond the ﬁrst row of the Periodic Table.) Re-

cently, some attempts have been made to replace the core correlation step by bond additivity

approximations[12, and references therein], and promising results have been obtained[13] by

means of core polarization potentials[14].

Despite repeated warnings in the literature against the practice (e.g., by Taylor[15], by one

of the present authors[4], and by Woon and Dunning[6]), core correlation is often included

— for technical reasons or ‘because it cannot hurt’ — in calculations using basis sets (e.g.

the standard Dunning correlation consistent basis sets[16, 17], which are of minimal basis set

quality in the inner-shell orbitals) which are not adapted for nonvalence correlation. This

can often cause errors on computed properties well in excess of the basis set incompleteness

error: For instance, a comparison between valence-only[18] and all-electron[19] CCSD(T)/cc-

pVTZ harmonic frequency calculations on the cyclic isomer of C4 suggests core correlation
contributions to the harmonic frequencies of up to 50 cm−1, a factor of ﬁve more than the

true correction obtained[18] with a core correlation basis set.

For the elements B–Ne and Al–Ar, the gap between valence and inner-shell orbital energies

is large enough that a conventional core-valence separation of the orbital energies is easily

made. Things are less simple further down the periodic table. Bauschlicher[20, 21] noted

that for gallium and indium halides, the valence (2s) orbitals of the halogen are below the

Ga(3d) or In(4d) ‘core’ orbitals in energy. At the very least, these d orbitals should be added

to the correlation space; suitable basis sets for this purpose have been developed by Martin

and Sundermann[22] for Ga and Ge, and by Bauschlicher [21] for In.

But similar issues arise with Group 1 and 2 elements. Radom and coworkers[23, 24]

recently noted catastrophic failures of G2 theory and related methods in predicting the

heats of formation of various alkali and alkaline earth metal oxides and hydroxides:

for

example, the binding energy of K2O is underestimated by no less than 256 kJ/mol! Upon

correlating all electrons, this error decreases to 60 kJ/mol, which is further decreased to 17

3

kJ/mol when more sophisticated electron correlation methods are used. Inspection of an

atomic orbital energy table[25] quickly reveals why: the oxygen 2s and 2p valence orbitals

lie below the potassium 3s and 3p inner-shell orbitals, rendering the conventional separation

between ‘valence’ and ‘core’ orbitals essentially meaningless.

Inclusion of Group 1 and 2

subvalence correlation — termed ‘relaxed inner valence’ (RIV) by Radom and coworkers[23]

— may in fact be the appropriate treatment, not just for K (and Ca) compounds, but for

alkali and alkaline earth metal compounds in general. (One of the ﬁrst papers to recognize

the importance of inner-shell correlation for alkali metals may have been that by Liu and

coworkers.[26])

This problem is far from academic, considering the great importance of K+, Ca2+, Na+,

and Mg2+ complexes in molecular biology. In addition, a number of these interactions (e.g.,

of the cation-π type) are not necessarily amenable to density functional treatments without

validation of some kind by means of ab initio methods. Clearly, the availability of high-

quality core-valence basis sets for the elements Li, Be, Na, Mg, K, and Ca would beneﬁt

the high-accuracy computational thermochemistry and spectroscopy communities as well as

biomolecular modelers. The purpose of the present work is the development and validation

of CVnZ (core-valence n-tuple zeta, n=D, T, Q, 5) basis sets for these elements.

II. COMPUTATIONAL DETAILS

All electronic structure calculations carried out in the present work were carried out using

the MOLPRO 2000.1 and 2002.3 program systems[27, 28] running on SGI Origin 2000 (12

×MIPS R10000, 300 MHz and 4 ×MIPS R10000, 195 MHz, IRIX 6.5) and Compaq ES40

(4 × EV67, 667 MHz, Tru64 Unix 4.0f) minisupercomputers, as well as Compaq XP1000

(EV6, 500 MHz, Tru64 Unix 4.0f) and dual Intel Xeon (1.7, 2.0 and 2.4 GHz, RedHat Linux

7.2 and 7.3) workstations.

Unless explicitly noted otherwise, energy calculations were carried out at the CCSD(T)

level; for open-shell systems, single-determinant ROHF reference functions were used, but

the deﬁnition of the CCSD(T) energy according to Watts et al.[29] was employed throughout.

Validation calculations on diatomic molecules were carried out as follows. Energies were

computed at 21 equidistant points around the putative bond distance with interpoint spac-
ings of 0.01–0.03 ˚A, depending on the curvature of the surface. Energies at these points

4

were converged as precisely as feasible, with integral evaluation thresholds being tightened

as necessary. Polynomials of increasing order were then ﬁt through the points, and the

signiﬁcance of the additional order terms subjected to a Fisher-Snedecor test. The expan-

sion was truncated at the point where the two-way signiﬁcance of the next higher order

dropped below 99%. The retained expansion was generally of order between six and eight.

The minimum of this curve was then sought by means of a Newton-Raphson method, and

the curve re-expanded around the minimum. A Dunham analysis[30] was then carried out

on the ﬁnal curve. The computed dissociation energies at 0 K, D0, reported in the tables

include anharmonic zero-point corrections from the computed ωe and ωexe at the same level

of theory.

As for the accompanying basis sets, standard cc-pVnZ basis sets were used throughout

on H. For O and F, aug-cc-pVnZ basis sets[31] were used in valence calculations and aug-cc-

pCVnZ basis sets[6] in calculation where the O and F (1s) cores were correlated. For S and

Cl, the aug-cc-pV(n + d)Z basis sets of Wilson et al.[32] were used in valence calculations,

and the cc-pCVnZ basis sets of Peterson[10] in calculations where the (2s,2p) cores of these

elements were correlated.

PRO 2002.3[28].

Where deemed necessary, scalar relativistic eﬀects were assessed by means of CCSD(T)

calculations within the Douglas-Kroll-Hess approximation[33, 34] as implemented in MOL-

III. OPTIMIZATION OF CVnZ BASIS SETS

A. General procedure

The basis set optimizations were carried out using a Fortran program developed in-house.

Derivatives were obtained numerically using central diﬀerences, yielding both the gradient

and the diagonal of the Hessian. The step thus obtained — essentially Newton-Raphson

with neglect of oﬀ-diagonal Hessian elements — was combined with a Brent line search. Our

experience with this simple but fairly robust optimization algorithm is quite good as long as

optimization parameters are not too strongly coupled. In the presence of signiﬁcant coupling,

DIIS (Direct Inversion of the Iterative Subspace) [35] dramatically sped up convergence.

Finite diﬀerence step sizes were made roughly proportional to the parameters themselves,

5

and increased as necessary if the parameter surface in the aﬀected direction was found to

be particularly ‘ﬂat’.

Some additional optimizations were carried out using an adaptation of the DOMIN

program by P. Spellucci[36], which is an implementation of the BFGS (Broyden-Fletcher-

Goldfarb-Shanno) variable-metric method. Numerical derivatives of order two, four, and

six were used: the lower orders until an approximate minimum was reached, after which

the optimization was reﬁned using the higher orders. In most cases, however, the simple

procedure outlined above appeared to be more robust.

For the purposes of the optimization (and since only very small systems are involved),

integral evaluation, SCF and CI convergence thresholds in MOLPRO were tightened to

essentially machine precision. Basis set parameters were converged to at least four signiﬁcant

digits, and ﬁve where at all possible.

In cases where many primitives of a particular angular symmetry are required, we initially
constrained these functions to follow an even-tempered sequence ζi = αβ(i−n−1)/2, where n

is the total number of primitives. Only when optimum α and β had been reached were the

individual exponents optimized further without any constraints. If a set of (n−1) primitives

of that symmetry was already available (in casu, from a previously optimized smaller basis

set), the geometric mean of their exponents was taken as the starting value for α, and the

arithmetic mean of the ratios between successive primitives as the initial value for β.

A few ‘checks and balances’ can generally be applied to the ﬁnal exponents:

1. within a row, the geometric mean of the exponents should increase roughly as (Z ∗)2,

where Z ∗ is the ‘shielded’ nuclear charge (ﬁrst Ahlrichs-Taylor rule[37]);

2. exponents in a larger set (e.g. 3d) should mesh with the next smaller set (e.g. 2d);

3. the ratio of successive exponents in a set should be about two or higher, and all gaps

within the core or valence parts should roughly be of the same order;

4. the geometric mean of the exponents for each angular momentum should roughly

increase by a factor of 1.2 for each step up in L (second Ahlrichs-Taylor rule[37]).

6

B. Li and Be

For Li and Be, the ‘unoﬃcial’ cc-pVnZ basis sets of Feller[38] supplied in the MOLPRO

2000.1 basis set library were taken as starting points. The quantity optimized for is the (1s)

correlation energy at the CISD level for the Li(2S) and Be(1S) ground states, respectively.

This happens to be equivalent to E[CISD,full]−E[SCF] for Li, but is equal to E[CISD,full]-

E[CISD,valence] for Be.

There exists a tradition of optimizing basis sets for correlated calculations at the CISD

level, since CISD is a variational method. However, optimizations for the CCSD or CCSD(T)

counterparts of the abovementioned correlation energies yield very similar basis sets, which

would have been of identical quality in molecular calculations. (A table of these exponents

for the CVDZ, CVTZ, and CVQZ cases can be found in the Supplementary Material[39].)

By analogy with the cc-pCVnZ basis sets for B–Ne[40], 1s1p, 2s2p1d, 3s3p2d1f , and

4s4p3d2f 1g sets of primitives were added to the cc-pVDZ, cc-pVTZ, cc-pVQZ, and cc-pV5Z

basis sets, respectively. Successive angular momenta were optimized individually, after which

the complete set of exponents was further optimized together.

Multiple local minima exist for the larger sets, and care was taken to ensure that the

ﬁnal optimized basis set reﬂects the most ‘contiguous’ (or most ‘even-tempered’) solution in

the sense of having no obvious ‘gaps’ between exponents.

Aside from this issue, the basis set optimizations proceeded uneventfully.

C. Na and Mg

Likewise, for Na and Mg, unpublished cc-pVnZ basis sets of Feller[38] were taken as

the starting point.

In this case, we optimized for the 2s2p correlation energy, found as

E[CISD,2s2p3s]-E[CISD,3s] for Mg and as simply E[CISD,2s2p3s]-E[SCF] for Na. Note that

the 1s orbitals are constrained to be doubly occupied throughout: not only will the eﬀect

of this ’deep core’ orbital on chemically signiﬁcant properties be negligible, but including

it in the optimization would bias the exponents towards the large — but chemically quite

invariant — core-core correlation energy rather than the chemically more signiﬁcant 2s2p

core-core and core-valence correlation energies.

Since the highest core correlation orbital is of p symmetry in this case, the basis sets

7

are rather larger, involving addition of 1s1p1d, 2s2p2d1f , 3s3p3d2f 1g, 4s4p4d3f 2g1h core

correlation sets to the cc-pVDZ, cc-pVTZ, cc-pVQZ, and cc-pV5Z sets, respectively.

For the CV5Z basis sets for Na and Mg, simply optimizing a set of core correlation s

functions leads to such serious near-linear dependence problems that the basis would in

practice be unusable. For want of an alternative, we simply uncontracted an additional four

s primitives instead.

D. K and Ca

The core-valence gap in Ca, and particularly K, is so small that the optimization of regular

cc-pVnZ basis sets would be of largely academic interest. Feller and coworkers previously

published CVDZ, CVTZ, and CVQZ basis sets for K[41]; the sp exponents for the CVDZ and

CVTZ basis sets were taken from (15s,12p) and (18s,15p) basis sets, respectively, of Ahlrichs

and coworkers[42], while those for the CVQZ basis set were taken from the Partridge-1

set[43], which is of (23s,19p) uncontracted size.

Initially we employed these basis sets unaltered, and merely added a CV5Z basis set.

This was obtained as follows, starting from the Partridge-3 basis set:

• the basis set was contracted to miminal (i.e.

[4s3p]) in an atomic calculation on the

ground state

• the four outermost s and p primitives each were decontracted

• [4d3f 2g1h] functions were optimized at the valence-only CISD level for the K2 molecule

at its experimental bond distance, yielding an intermediate cc-pV5Z basis set

• core correlation functions were obtained by optimizing the atomic E[CISD,3s3p4s]-

E[SCF] energy. The optimization of the s and p functions was plagued by insur-

mountable near-linear dependence problems, and we ended up merely decontracting

an additional four primitives of s and p symmetries each.

In addition, a crossover

occurred between the highest d exponent of the underlying cc-pV5Z basis set and the

lowest d exponent required for the inner-shell correlation, and it was decided to merely

keep the outermost three d primitives constant while optimizing all ﬁve remaining d

primitives for 3s3p correlation.

8

Thus, our original CV5Z basis set was obtained. However, as evidenced in Table I,

basis set convergence of properties for K2 and KH was less than satisfactory. In particular,

inspection of the dissociation energy as a function of the basis set reveals that for K2, the

CVTZ, CVQZ, and CV5Z results are nearly collinear, which is obviously undesirable. For

this reason, the d, f, . . . exponents of the K CVTZ and CVQZ basis sets were reoptimized

in the same manner as the CV5Z basis set. In the process we found the ‘valence correlation’

d and f exponents in the original Feller basis sets to be excessively ‘tight’, and with the

adjusted basis sets (denoted ‘version 0.1’ in Table I), increases of 6.5 and 7.0 kJ/mol are

seen in the CVTZ and CVQZ D0 values. Other molecular constants are also aﬀected quite

signiﬁcantly. While the Feller CVTZ and CVQZ were not found to be as problematic for

the other K compounds considered in this work, they are clearly unsuitable for K2 or any

other system with similar long-distance bonding.

Analogously, we optimized CVnZ (n=D,T,Q,5) basis sets for Ca, starting from Ahlrichs

14s9p, Partridge-1 20s12p, Partridge-2 23s16p, and Partridge-3 26s16p primitive sets. Ini-

tial attempts to optimize basis sets for the 3P atomic excited state (analogously to the

sp-hybridized state of Be) yielded exceedingly poor basis set convergence of molecular prop-

erties, and these basis sets were abandoned in favor of 1S ground-state optimized basis sets.

(We also attempted optimizations in the CaH2 molecule, and found basis set parameters

obtained there to be very similar to those for the 1S atomic ground state.) Valence correla-

tion functions were optimized for the valence correlation energy of the ground-state calcium

atom, and core-valence functions for E[CISD,3s3p4s]-E[CISD,4s]. For the CVQZ and CV5Z

basis sets, the optimized ‘valence’ and ‘subvalence’ d and f shells interlock, and as a result

only the outermost 2d2f were held at their valence-optimized values and the remainder

reoptimized for inner-shell correlation. No such issues arose with the g and h functions.

Once again, basis set convergence of molecular properties (e.g. for CaH, but also for other

diatomics, not displayed here) was found to be somewhat unsatisfactory.

For both atoms, we then optimized a sequence of four ‘stretch-tuned’ basis sets[44],

i.e. basis sets in which the exponents of each angular momentum obey the following four-

parameter relation:

ln ζn = α + n(β + (n − 1)(γ + (n − 2)δ))

(1)

(A total of only eight parameters thus had to be optimized for each basis set.) The particular

sequence of contraction sizes chosen was (20s12p), (22s14p), (24s16p), and (26s18p). The

9

valence and inner-shell correlation functions were optimized as before.

These basis sets (denoted ‘version 0.2’ in Table I) appeared to have better convergence

properties. However, something was clearly still not satisfactory. For instance, basis set

convergence for the ionization potentials of K and Ca atoms was found to be atypically slow

(Table II).

It then occurred to us that, as the 4s orbital of these atoms is very diﬀuse, the atom-

optimized p functions may be too ‘tight’ (as they were optimized for atoms with vacant

4p orbitals) to contain suitable ﬁrst polarization/angular correlation functions for the outer

part of the 4s orbital. This assumption was veriﬁed by optimizing single ‘probe’ basis

functions of various symmetries on top of CVnZ basis sets held constant. (Only valence

electrons were correlated, as otherwise the functions would have fallen into the ‘gravity

well’ of the inner-shell electrons.) A very noticeable lowering of the total energy was seen

upon adding a single p function, the optimum exponent of which indeed turned out to be

‘looser’ than any of the existing p functions. An additional ‘loose’ p function led to a further

improvement for the K CVnZ (n=D,T,Q) basis sets, but not for the K CV5Z basis set (the

outer p primitive of which is already quite ‘loose’) or any of the Ca basis sets. Consequently,

the valence correlation parts of the CVnZ basis sets were reoptimized with two and one

additional p functions added, respectively, for K and Ca, and afterwards the inner-shell part

was reoptimized for consistency. Thus our ﬁnal CVnZ basis sets were obtained. As seen in

Table I, basis set convergence of molecular parameters is now satisfactory. For IP(K) and

IP(Ca), nearly exact values are now obtained (Table II).

Since the primitive K and Ca basis sets may be somewhat bulky for some applications,

we have also generated SDB-CVnZ basis sets, which are combinations of the valence and

subvalence parts of the CVnZ basis sets with small-core Stuttgart-Dresden-Bonn[45] rel-

ativistic eﬀective core potentials. The latter replace the (1s2s2p) electrons. Unlike the

situation with large-core basis set where reoptimization of the basis set is essential[22], we

have kept all exponents at their all-electron values and merely ‘pruned’ and recontracted the

basis set. Speciﬁcally, the atomic SCF calculation was repeated with the (1s2s2p) orbitals

replaced by the SDB pseudopotential denoted ‘ECP10MWB’. Then all primitives with ab-
solute coeﬃcients of less than 10−5 in any valence orbitals were deleted, and the orbitals

recontracted.

All basis sets obtained in this work are available in machine-readable form (Gaussian and

10

MOLPRO formats) as supplementary material[39] to the present paper. Contracted basis

set sizes and numbers of basis functions for each element are given in Table IV.

IV. VALIDATION FOR DIATOMIC MOLECULES

A. Diatomic metal hydrides

Since hydrogen has no core electrons, there are no diﬀerential core-core contributions

(just core-valence) to the molecular properties. Computed and experimental data for the

diatomic hydrides are given in Table V.

As noted previously, the inner-shell contribution to the LiH spectroscopic constants is

quite appreciable, as can be expected from the small Li(1s)-H(2s) gap of about 2 a.u. We

note that the CCSD(T,riv)/CV5Z results reproduce the Born-Oppenheimer bond distance
and harmonic frequency to within 0.0002 ˚A and 0.2 cm−1, respectively. Neglect of Li(1s) cor-
relation leads to errors of 0.012 ˚A and 13.5 cm−1, respectively. Nevertheless, the contribution

to De does not exceed 1.2 kJ/mol.

The corresponding core-valence gap for BeH is almost doubled, which translates into sub-

stantially reduced core-valence contributions (relatively speaking) to re and ωe. Interestingly,

the contribution to D0 reaches nearly 2 kJ/mol.

In contrast, the Na(2p)-H(1s) gap narrows to no more than 1 a.u., and in NaH we see
inner-shell correlation contributions of 33 cm−1 to ωe and 0.035 ˚A to re. Interestingly, once

more De is nearly unaﬀected. Once more, the CCSD(T,riv)/CV5Z results are in excellent

agreement with experiment for the spectroscopic constants: applying a W2-type extrapola-

tion for D0 results in a value of 182.35 kJ/mol, within 0.3 kJ/mol of experiment.

Given that the Mg(2p)-H(1s) gap is not dissimilar from the corresponding one in LiH,

it is not greatly surprising that the importance of core-valence contributions is again much

smaller than in NaH. However, the 8 kJ/mol contribution to D0 is considerably more sig-

niﬁcant.

In KH, the K(3p) and H(1s) orbitals are closer than 0.5 a.u., and the contributions of
nearly 0.1 ˚A and 44 cm−1 to re and ωe, respectively, clearly suggest that any sort of ‘valence

correlation only’ calculation on a K compound should be viewed with great suspicion. Note

that the core-valence contribution to D0 is negative in this case, as was previously found

11

(e.g. [12]) for aluminum and silicon hydrides.

In comparison, the Ca(3p)–H(1s) gap widens to 0.84 a.u., and core-valence eﬀects on the

molecular properties are mitigated accordingly. Like for MgH and KH, inner-shell correlation

in fact slightly reduces the dissociation energy.

With the exception of KH and CaH, the diﬀerential core-valence contributions appear

to have converged with respect to the basis set at the CVQZ stage. This in itself satis-

ﬁes a minimum requirement for treating the inner-shell correlation contribution separately,

something which is deﬁnitely inappropriate for KH.

On the whole, agreement between CCSD(T,riv)/CV5Z and experiment can only be de-

scribed as quite satisfactory. For systems other than LiH and NaH, imperfections in the

CCSD(T) electron correlation method may account for most of the remaining discrepancy

between computed and observed harmonic frequencies[46].

B. Metal diatomics

The alkaline earth metal dimers (particularly Be2) exhibit such severe multireference

character that they warrant studies in themselves (which would, however, focus on electron

correlation methods rather than basis sets, see e.g.[47] and references therein). Results for

species other than Be2 can be found in Table VI.

In Li2, subvalence correlation accounts for 0.024 ˚A, which is sizable by spectroscopist’s
In Na2, this is drastically increased to nearly 0.1 ˚A, and reaches a whopping
standards.
0.23 ˚A in K2. Interestingly, these contributions are quite close to double their metal hydride

counterparts. As expected, LiNa and NaK represent scenarios intermediate between the

homonuclear diatomics of the constituent elements. Changes in ωe are modest in absolute

numbers, but for these molecules represent relative errors of up to 5%. It is quite clear how-

ever that, with the possible exception of Li2, inclusion of subvalence correlation is essential

for reliable molecular parameters. Once again we see, however, that bond energies are only

aﬀected mildly: 0.8 kJ/mol in Li2, 1.7 kJ/mol in LiNa, 1.6 kJ/mol in Na2, and only 0.5

kJ/mol in K2.

diﬀerential core-valence eﬀects.

Once again, a basis set of CVQZ quality appears to be close to convergence for the

Eﬀects for Mg2 and Ca2 are considerably milder than for their alkali neighbors, yet (3s, 3p)

12

correlation reduces the Ca2 bond distance by 0.07–0.08 ˚A, not negligible by any reasonable

standard. The discrepancies between theory and experiment for Mg2 primarily reﬂect the

inadequacy of the CCSD(T) method for this highly multireference system. In contrast, Ca2

yields quite satisfying results compared to experiment.

Agreement between our best calculations and experiment can only be described as excel-

lent for Li2. The same would be true of Na2 if it were not for the bond length which is still
0.003 ˚A too long at the CCSD(T,riv)/CV5Z level. However, at the DK-CCSD(T)/CVQZ
level, we ﬁnd a scalar relativistic correction to the bond length of -0.006 ˚A. (If this correc-

tion would seem to be exaggerated, we note that the Na2 potential curve is quite ﬂat, and
that already for OH− and HF, scalar relativistic corrections were found to be required for

spectroscopic-quality results[48].) In K2, our best calculated results are likewise in excellent

agreement with the experimental spectroscopic data except for re, which is calculated to be
0.014 ˚A longer than the observed value. At the DK-CCSD(T)/CVQZ level, we ﬁnd a rela-
tivistic contribution of -0.013 ˚A to the bond length, which explains most of the discrepancy.

In addition, the (2s, 2p) ‘deep core’ orbitals are energetically in the same range as the (1s)

orbitals in C and N, so it cannot be entirely ruled out that ‘deep core’ correlation may aﬀect

molecular properties in K compounds.

We optimized a CCVTZ (deep core valence triple zeta) basis set for K. In these calcu-

lations, the CVTZ basis set was held constant and exponents of 2s2p2d1f basis functions

optimized for E[CISD,2s2p3s3p4s]−E[CISD,3s3p4s], i.e.

for deep-core correlation energy

taken in isolation. As can be seen in Table III, these exponents are obviously much ‘tighter’,

by almost an order of magnitude, than those required for subvalence correlation. Hence, any

‘deep core’ result in a mere valence and subvalence CVnZ (let alone a valence-only cc-pVnZ

set) should be regarded with skepticism at best.

The only change of note we see in the molecular properties when using this CCVTZ
basis set for K2 is a shortening of the K–K bond by another 0.0018 ˚A. We also attempted

to optimize a CCVQZ basis set but ran into insurmountable near-linear-dependence prob-

lems; however, the CCVTZ result should at least give an indication of the (fairly modest)

magnitude of this eﬀect.

13

C. Diatomic metal halides

This set of molecules is particularly revelant because of the deep-lying valence s orbitals

on the halogen atoms. Relevant results are collected in Table VII.

Firstly, for LiF the contribution of Li(1s) correlation to the binding energy is somewhat
more noticeable (4 kJ/mol). Its inclusion also causes a contraction of the bond by 0.015 ˚A
and an increase in ωe of 12 cm−1. The further eﬀect of permitting F(1s) correlation is nearly

negligible in comparison. The Cl(2s,2p) correlation eﬀect is somewhat more noticeable but

still Li(1s) correlation accounts for the lion’s share of the changes.

The F(2s) and Na(2p) orbitals are nearly degenerate, and hence one would expect valence-

only calculations on NaF to be problematic, to say the least. Nevertheless, while the eﬀect of

Na(2s,2p) correlation on the molecular constants is quite noticeable and its inclusion clearly

essential for accurate calculations, the results obtained are not outright nonsensical. Of

course, considering the diﬀerence in electronegativity between the elements, the combination
of Na+ and F− would yield a more appropriate (if perhaps extreme) ‘atoms in molecules’

picture — and the corresponding orbital energy gap in this admittedly extreme scenario is

0.72 a.u. with the Partridge 3 basis set. The corresponding ‘ionic’ gap for NaCl amounts to

1.07 a.u., explaining why also for NaCl, valence-only results are not totally unreasonable.

The person carrying out calculations on KF and KCl has no such luck. The inclusion

of K(3s3p) correlation shifts ωe in KF upwards by no less than 20%, and the contribution

to De is seen to be on the order of 170 kJ/mol.

In fact, the ‘valence’ results are better

described as referring to correlating the z component of K(3p) and freezing the F(2s), which

obviously makes no chemical sense at all. The valence-computed dissociation energy of KCl
agrees deceptively well with experiment, but an error of 0.3 ˚A in the bond distance and of a

factor of three in the anharmonicity constant should discourage any quantum chemist from

performing valence-only calculations on this type of species.

While obviously signiﬁcant for spectroscopic purposes, the eﬀects of metal subvalence

correlation in MgF and MgCl are clearly less prominent than in NaF and NaCl, respectively,

and with the beryllium halides, one clearly could ‘get away’ with a diﬀerential treatment.

In contrast, in CaF a calcium subvalence contribution to D0 of 180 kJ/mol is found, not to
mention +46 cm−1 on ωe and a factor of two on ωexe. Oddly, the eﬀect on the bond length
is comparatively small (0.04 ˚A). The opposite scenario is seen for CaCl, with a ∆re of 0.1 ˚A

14

but otherwise not outlandishly erroneous values for the other spectroscopic constants. CaF

and CaCl results resemble more the potassium halides.

And once again, the CCSD(T,riv)/CV5Z results agree as well with experiment as can

reasonably be expected.

We have also considered calculations in which subvalence correlation on the halide was

permitted. However, for K and Ca compounds with {C, N, O, F}, the (1s) orbital of these

latter elements is in fact below the K(2s,2p) ‘deep core’ orbitals in energy, and therefore any

such calculation will require the use of CCVnZ ‘deep core’ basis sets on the metal. Such

calculations are suﬃciently costly that one might want to limit them to single-point energy

calculations in high-accuracy thermodynamic work. For MCl, the most noticeable eﬀect of
including (2s, 2p) subvalence correlation on chlorine is a contraction of re by 0.003 ˚A.

D. The metal chalcogenides

We will primarily focus on the oxides. Results can be found in Table VIII.
Clearly, changes of 13 cm−1 and 6 kJ/mol, respectively, for ωe and De of BeO suggest

the importance of metal (1s) correlation in this system; contributions from O(1s) correla-

tion are an order of magnitude less important. Note that the experimental data can be

reproduced almost exactly at the CCSD(T,all)/CV5Z level, despite BeO having pronounced

multireference character and in fact being on the borderline of applicability of CCSD(T) (see

e.g.[49]). In the isovalent BeS system, Be(1s) correlation is still noticeably more important

than S(2s,2p) correlation, although the diﬀerence is not as pronounced as its counterpart in

Changes between valence-only and RIV treatment of 0.017 ˚A in re(MgO) and 23 cm−1

in ωe(MgO) speak for themselves. The MgO molecule has very pronounced multireference

character, and accurate reproduction of the experimental spectroscopic constants would

required an elaborate multireference treatment. Subvalence correlation eﬀects in MgS are

BeO.

rather milder.

In contrast, inspection of the computed spectroscopic constants for CaO immediately

reveals that valence-only calculations on this system are essentially exercises in wasting

computer time. Valence-only bond distances and dissociation energies are oﬀ by a quarter
of an ˚A, and a factor of six in D0. Respectable agreement with experiment can however

15

be reached by correlating the Ca(3s,3p) electrons. Obviously, the large uncertainties in the

measured dissociation energies preclude really ﬁne comparisons with experiment: on the

basis of the preceding, it can perhaps be stated that the calculated binding energies are

more reliable than the experimental ones for the alkali(ne earth) metal chalcogenides.

Once again, correlating the (1s) orbital on O would require including (2s, 2p) deep-core

correlation in Ca, otherwise meaningless results are obtained.

E. Additional d functions on Ca

Wesolowski et al.[50], in a study of calcium oxide, observed especially poor performance

for a valence-only atomic natural orbital (ANO) basis set[51]. This was considerably im-

proved when high-exponent d functions were added. They noted that Ca+ has a low-lying

2D state only 1.7 eV above the 2S ground state, and showed that said ANO basis set over-

estimates this separation by nearly a factor of three. Addition of several very high-exponent

d functions, taken from the 6-311G(2df) basis set for Ca[52] (which treats the (3d) orbital

on a valence footing), results in an at least semiquantitatively correct result.

As the present basis sets were developed from the ground up with inner-shell correlation

in mind, they intrinsically contain high-exponent d functions and should therefore be much

less susceptible to the problem. As shown in Table IX, quite good agreement with the

experimental transition energy is obtained for CVQZ and CV5Z basis sets, but the smaller

basis sets leave something to be desired.

We therefore proceeded to optimize CV(n+d)Z, CV(n+2d)Z, and CV(n+3d)Z basis sets

in the following fashion. (Both the nomenclature and the procedure bear resemblance to

the cc-pV(n + d)Z basis sets for second-row elements[32].) All angular momenta other than

d were kept constant, as were the valence-optimized d functions (see above). The remaining

d functions were reoptimized for inner-shell correlation with one, two, or three additional d

functions added. (In the CV(Q+d)Z and CV(Q+2d)Z basis sets, it was found necessary to

constrain the exponents to stretch-tuned and even-tempered sequences, respectively.)

As can be seen in Table IX, the 2D ← 2S excitation energy indeed converges considerably

faster for the CV(n + d)Z and CV(n + 2d)Z series than for the CVnZ series. After applying

a scalar relativistic correction by means of the Douglas-Kroll method in an uncontracted

CV(Q+d)Z basis sets, very good agreement with experiment can be achieved. As for the

16

molecular properties of CaO (Table VIII), the eﬀect of additional d functions is quite dra-

matic in the CVDZ case and still quite important in the CVTZ case, but tapers oﬀ for CVQZ

and becomes quite insigniﬁcant for CV5Z. We noticed similar behavior in the other CaX

systems considered in this paper (Tables V, VI, and VII). Convergence as a function of the

number of additional d functions appears to be approached for CV(D+3d)Z, CV(T+2d)Z,

CV(Q+d)Z, and CV5Z (note particularly Table VIII). Basis set convergence of molecular

properties along this sequence is clearly much smoother than for the unmodiﬁed CVnZ basis

sets. This is particularly true for CaO and, to a somewhat lesser extent, for CaF, least so

for CaH and Ca2 where basis set convergence was adequate to begin with.

V. CONCLUSIONS

Core-valence basis sets have been developed for the alkali and alkaline earth metals Li,

Be, Na, Mg, K, and Ca. Validation calculations for a number of diatomics involving these

systems reveal basis set convergence to be satisfactory.

The addition of low-exponent p functions to the K and Ca basis set is found to be essential

for smooth basis set convergence of molecular properties. These functions accommodate

angular correlation from the outer part of the 4s orbital.

Valence-only calculations on K and Ca chalcogenides and halides yield large errors at best,

and chemically nonsensical results at worst. In general, inclusion of subvalence correlation

in K and Ca compounds is absolutely essential for even reliable (let alone accurate) results,

while for accurate calculations, subvalence correlation in Na (and, to a lesser extent, Li

and Mg) should be included, preferably as a ‘baseline’ treatment rather than an additive

correction. The latter appears to be suﬃcient for Be compounds. Any study that seeks to

address the importance of ﬁrst-row element core correlation in K and Ca compounds should

also consider deep-core (2s,2p) correlation from these latter elements.

For compounds involving Ca bound to highly electronegative elements, we strongly rec-

ommend basis sets with additional d functions on Ca: our suggested sequence for basis set

convergence studies would be CV(D+3d)Z, CV(T+2d)Z, CV(Q+d)Z, CV5Z.

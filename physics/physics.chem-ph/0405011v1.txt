Abstract

The coherence of two, coupled two-level systems, representing vibrational modes in a semiclassical

model, is calculated in weak and strong ﬁelds for various coupling schemes and for diﬀerent relative

phases between initial state amplitudes. A relative phase equal to π projects the system into a

dark state. The selective excitation of one of the two, two-level systems is studied as a function of

coupling strength and initial phases.

INTRODUCTION

Investigations of coherent dynamics in multidimensional systems induced by ultrafast

shaped pulses is being carried out in a number of research groups [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9].

Special attention is paid to the development of femtosecond laser techniques for control

over molecular motion in stimulated Raman spectroscopy, [3, 5, 6, 10, 11]. In these works

the selective Raman excitations are achieved with femtosecond laser pulses with spectral or

phase modulation. The goal is to prepare a speciﬁc quantum state to facilitate ’unusual’

structural changes or chemical reactions, [8, 9, 12, 13]. Another fundamental application is

related to the development of quantum memory for information storage, [14]. A composition

of two-level systems, e.g., vibrational normal modes within an ensemble of molecules, driven

by an optical ﬁeld, may serve as a storage device of quantum information.

One of the important steps needed for eﬃcient control of molecular motion is an under-

standing of the factors that govern the system’s time evolution. In this paper femtosecond

pulse shaping is discussed that allow for the selective excitation of unresolved, coupled Ra-

man transitions.

In [5], a comparative analysis of Raman spectra of liquid methanol and a mixture of

benzene and deuterated benzene showed experimental evidence for the dependence of the

selective excitation on intramolecular coupling of normal vibrational modes in a molecule.

In this paper a semiclassical model is developed for the interaction of a shaped ultrafast laser

pulse with two, coupled two-level systems, representing coupled vibrational modes in a single

molecule. Speciﬁc questions about the mechanisms of interaction of an external ﬁeld with

molecular media are addressed such as how the coupling via an external ﬁeld inﬂuences the

controllability of selective excitation and how the result depends on the coupling strength.

We also investigate the ways of implementing a coupling mechanism for coherent control.

Within our model selective, high level coherence can be achieved in two coupled two-level

systems by a choice of the relative phase of the initially populated states. For a particular

phase, a dark state is formed with zero eigenvalue of the interaction Hamiltonian. It is known

that for a quantum system in a dark state the prevention of decoherence may be achieved,

e.g., [15]. Molecules prepared in such a state may be useful for quantum computation and

communication.

II. BASIC FORMALISM

A semiclassical model is used to describe the interaction of an ultrafast laser pulse with a

molecular medium using stimulated Raman scattering. The model is represented schemati-

cally in Fig.1, where two, two-level systems describe two Raman active modes in a molecule.

Levels

3 > are at zero relative energy, while levels

|

¯hω2 and ¯hω4, respectively. Transition dipole moment matrix elements of the levels with a

virtual intermediate state

b > are equal to µib. Generally they may be diﬀerent. We inves-

|

tigate the eﬀects in weak and strong ﬁelds caused by coupling between normal vibrational

modes in a molecule and by the relative phase of the amplitudes of the initially populated

states. Transition matrix elements of the 3-4 two-level system are assumed to be equal,

µ3b = µ4b, and transition matrix elements of the 1-2 two-level system satisfy the following
conditions µ1b

µ3b = r. The equations of motion for the probability amplitudes of two

The speciﬁc form for the pulse shape is taken such that in the weak ﬁeld regime the pulse

selectively excites transitions of predetermined frequencies, while in strong ﬁelds the result

depends on the intensity of the ﬁeld I0. The intensity envelope I(t) is deﬁned as a real part

(1)

of the Fourier transform of a function f (ω) speciﬁed as

spectral proﬁle identical to the one suggested in [16] except for the fact that it contains a

”dc” component centered at ω = 0, to ensure that I(t) is positive.

The real part of the inverse Fourier transform of the spectral density (2) gives a temporal

pulse function:

III. MODE COUPLING

A numerical solution of the time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation (1) describing two cou-

pled two-level systems was obtained with I(t) given by Eq.(3) and two values of r, equal to

1
2 and 1. The results reveal the importance of the relative phase between the initial state
amplitudes a1 and a3. This relative phase could be established by optical pumping into

are calculated as an average over relative phases between initially populated

IV. SUMMARY

We presented a semiclassical model of the coherent control of excitation of Raman transi-

tions in two coupled two-level systems using a broad-band shaped laser pulse. We analyzed

the eﬀects caused by the coupling between four levels via a laser ﬁeld. The coupling is

shown to cause an eﬃcient population transfer between two-level systems. Eﬀects caused by

the relative phase between the initially populated states were analyzed. Depending on the

intensity of the ﬁeld, the initial phase may cause predominance of the coherence of one two-

level system with respect to another. When the relative phase between initially populated

levels

1 > and

3 > is equal to π, two, two-level systems encounter stationary conditions

|

|

regardless of the external ﬁeld strength, implying the existence of a molecular dark state.

These results may be useful for investigation of decoherence processes caused by the driving

ﬁeld.

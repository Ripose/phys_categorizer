Taking into account the structural transition and long-range interaction (lattice effect), we resort to the Ewald-
Kornfeld formulation and the well-known developed Maxwell-Garnett theory for uniaxially anisotropic suspen-
sions to calculate the effective permeability of the inverse ferroﬂuid. And we also consider the effects of the
volume fraction and geometric shape of the nonmagnetic particles to the magnetophoretic force on the nonmag-
netic particles. It is found that the absolute value of the magnetophoretic force decreases as the volume fraction
increases. For nonspherical case, the absolute value of the magnetophoretic force decreases as the aspect ratio
(k) increases.

INTRODUCTION

Magnetizable particles experience a force in a nonuniform
magnetic ﬁeld, which comes from the interaction between the
induced dipole moment inside the particles and the external
nonuniform magnetic ﬁeld. This phenomenon, sometimes
called magnetophoresis (M AP ), which has been exploited in
a variety of industrial and commercial process for separation
and beneﬁciation of solids suspended in liquids [1]. The non-
magnetic particle suspended in the ferroﬂuid possesses mag-
netic moment, so it also experiences a force in a nonuniform
magnetic ﬁeld. Magnetophoresis may open up an approach to
characterize and separate cells for biochemical analysis based
on intrinsic and extrinsic magnetic properties of biological
macromolecules [2].

∼

In recent years, inverse ferroﬂuids with nonmagnetic col-
loidal particles (or magnetic holes) suspended in a ferroﬂuid
have drawn much attention for their potential industrial and
biomedical applications
[3, 4, 5, 6]. The size of the
nonmagnetic particle (such as polystyrene particle) is about
1
100µm. Ferroﬂuid, also known as magnetic ﬂuid, is a col-
loidal suspension of single-domain magnetic particles, with
typical dimension around 10nm, dispersed in a liquid carrier
[7, 8]. Since the nonmagnetic particles are much larger than
the magnetic nanoparticles, the magnetic ﬂuid can be treated
as a one-component continuum with respect to the larger non-
magnetic particles [9, 10]. Recently, Jian, Huang and Tao
ﬁrst theoretically suggested that the ground state of inverse
ferroﬂuid is body-centered tetragonal (bct) lattice [11], just
as the ground states of electrorheological ﬂuids and magne-
torheological ﬂuids [12, 13]. Here, we propose an alterna-
tive structural transition from the bct to the face-centered cu-
bic (f cc), through the application of external magnetic ﬁeld.
Then, we apply a nonuniform magnetic ﬁeld to investigate the
magnetophoresis of the nonmagnetic particles submerged in
the ferroﬂuid. In fact, one has investigated the force on the
microparticles in electrorheological solids under the applica-
tion of a nonuniform ac electric ﬁeld by using a self-consistent
method and the spectral representation approach [14]. In our
present work, we use the Ewald-Kornfeld formulation and the
well-known developed Maxwell-Garnett theory for uniaxially

anisotropic suspensions to calculate the effective permeability
of the inverse ferroﬂuid, considering the lattice effect, the vol-
ume fraction and shape of the nonmagnetic particle. Based on
this, the magnetophoretic force on the nonmagnetic particle
can be calculated.

This paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we introduce
the theory of magnetophoresis. By using the Ewald-Kornfeld
formulation and the well-known developed Maxwell-Garnett
theory for uniaxially anisotropic suspensions, we calculate the
effective permeability of the inverse ferroﬂuids. And we in-
vestigate the magnetophoretic force on the nonmagnetic par-
ticles in ferroﬂuids. This paper ends with a conclusion in Sec.
III.

II. THEORY AND FORMALISM

A. Theory of magnetophoresis

Let us ﬁrst consider the magnetically linear particles. For
a magnetically linear particle, the effective magnetic dipole
moment vector ~mef f takes a form very similar to that for the
effective dipole moment of dielectric sphere,

~mef f = 4πR

3

K(µ1, µ2) =

,

where R is the radius of the magnetically linear particle, µ1 is
the permeability of the magnetically linear particle, and µ2 is
the permeability of the host medium. The force exerted by a
nonuniform magnetic ﬁeld on a magnetic dipole ,

~Fdipole = µ2 ~mef f

H0 ,

· ∇

Combining this expression with that for the effective mag-
netic dipole moment, the magnetophoretic force exerted on
a magnetizable spherical particle in a nonuniform magnetic
ﬁeld can be written as [1],

Eq. (4) is similar to the expression of the dielectrophoretic
force on particles. The magnetophoretic force on particles are
proportional to the particle volume and the permeability of
the suspension medium. And the force is directed along the
gradient of the magnetic ﬁeld intensity. There are two kinds
of magnetophoresis depending upon the relative magnitudes
of µ1 and µ2. If K > 0 (µ1 > µ2), particles are attracted
to magnetic ﬁeld intensity maxima and repelled from min-
ima. This phenomenon is called positive magnetophoresis.
On the contrary, if K < 0 (µ1 < µ2), particles are attracted
to magnetic ﬁeld intensity minima and repelled from maxima.
This case is called negative magnetophoresis. Now, we con-
sider the nonlinear magnetophoresis. There are two kinds of
nonlinear magnetophoresis. The ﬁrst case is ferromagnetic
particles in a linear magnetizable medium. The other one is
nonmagnetic particles in a magnetizable liquid, such as a fer-
roﬂuid. In both cases, The magnetic ﬁeld is assumed to be dc
and hysteresis is ignored. In this work, the second case will be
considered. For the reason that the magnetic nonlinearity of
ferroﬂuid causes difﬁculties in calculating the effective mag-
netic moment for an immersed nonmagnetic particle. There-
fore, we use a Maxwell stress tensor formulation to predict the
magnetic force ~Ff f on nonmagnetic immersed particles,

adjacent to the surface Σ enclosing the particle. In a weak
(4) by setting µ1 = µ0 to
magnetic ﬁeld, we can use Eq.
calculate the magnetophorestic force on the nonmagnetic par-
ticles submerged in a ferroﬂuid.

·

B. Effective permeability

The effective permeability can be obtained by performing
an Ewald-Kornfeld formulation so that the structural tran-
sition and long-range interaction can be taken into account
explicitly. The ground state of inverse ferroﬂuid is a body-
centered-tetragonal (bct) lattice, which can be regarded as a
tetragonal lattice, plus a basis of two particles each of which is
ﬁxed with an induced point magnetic dipole at its center. One
of the two particles is located at a corner and the other one
at the body center of the tetragonal unit cell. The tetragonal
lattice has a lattice constant c1= ξq along the z axis and lattice
constants a1 = b1 = ξq− 1
2 along x and y axes respectively.
In this paper we identiﬁed a different structure transformation
from the bct to f cc by changing the uniaxial lattice constant
c1 under hard-sphere constraint. The volume of the tetragonal
unit cell remains certain value (ξ3) as q varies. In this way,
the degree of anisotropy of tetragonal lattice is measured by
how q is deviated from unity and the uniaxial anisotropic axis
1
is along the z axis. In particular, q = 0.87358, 1 and 2
3 rep-
resent the bct, bcc and f cc lattice, respectively.

When an external magnetic ﬁeld ~H0 is along the x axis, the
induced dipole moment ~m are perpendicular to the uniaxial
anisotropic axis. At the lattice point ~R=0, the local ﬁeld ~HL
can be determined by using the Ewald-Kornfeld formulation
[15, 16, 17],

Now, let us deﬁne a local ﬁeld factor α,

It is worth remaking that α is a function of single variable
q. Also there is a sum rule for αT and αL, 2αT + αL = 3
[18, 19], where αL denotes the local ﬁeld factor in longitu-
dinal ﬁeld case, and αT denotes the local ﬁeld in transverse
ﬁeld case. Here the longitudinal (or transverse) ﬁeld case cor-
responds to the fact the H0 ﬁeld is parallel (or perpendicular)
to the uniaxial anisotropic z axis. We can use the well-known
developed Maxwell-Garnett theory for uniaxially anisotropic
suspensions [20, 21],

It should be noted that Eq. (13) is ﬁt for the case of the
spherical nonmagnetic particle. For the cases of nonsphere
(such as prolate and oblate spheroids), we resort to the de-
magnetizing factor g to describe the shape of spheroids. For
a prolate spheroid, there is a = b < c, where a, b, c are three
principal axes of the spheriods, and the longitudinal demag-
netizing factor gL along the major axis c is,

It is worth mentioning the negative
−
sign. In our calculation, we choose the parameters µ1 = 1.0,
µ2 = 2.9 (The permeability of the nonmagnetic particle is µ0,
and the permeability of the typical ferroﬂuid is about 2.9 µ0
). In this case, the parameter K < 0 is corresponding to the
negative magnetophoresis. As a matter of fact, we want to
obtain the absolute value of the magnetophoretic force on the
nonmagnetic particle.

Figure 1 displays the dependence of F on q when the ex-
ternal magnetic ﬁeld is parallel to the uniaxial anisotropic
axis for three different volume fractions f=0.15, f=0.25 and
f=0.35. While Figure 2 shows the dependence of F on q when
the external magnetic ﬁeld is perpendicular to the uniaxial
anisotropic axis for three different volume fractions f=0.15,
f=0.25 and f=0.35. The two ﬁgures show that the magne-
tophoretic force on the nonmagnetic particles are different ac-
cording to different lattices. Because of the anisotropy, Fig.1
displays that F decreases as q increases.
Inverse behavior
appears in Fig2. Without the effect of the structural transi-
tion and the long-range interaction (lattice effect), F equals
to 0.81029. With the effect, take the bcc lattice for example,
F equals to 0.64797 when the volume fraction equals to 0.15.
The difference between the above two cases is large, which
means that the lattice effect plays an important role in Magne-
tophoresis of nonmagnetic particles in ferroﬂuids.

Now, let us focus our interest on the effect of the volume
fraction to the magnetophoretic force on the nonmagnetic par-
ticles. Fig. ?? represents the relation between F and q for

shows that the absolute value of the magnetophoretic force
on the nonmagnetic particles decreases as the volume frac-
tion increases. The relation between F and f for the exter-
nal magnetic ﬁeld parallel to the uniaxial anisotropic axis is
similar to that of the external magnetic ﬁeld perpendicular
to the uniaxial anisotropic axis, (see Fig. 2). As the vol-
ume fraction of the nonmagnetic particles increases, the lat-
tice effect becomes stronger. By using the well-known devel-
oped Maxwell-Garnett theory for uniaxially anisotropic sus-
pensions, a smaller effective permeability of the inverse fer-
roﬂuid can be obtained. Consequently, the absolute value of
the magnetophoretic force on the nonmagnetic particles be-
comes smaller.

Shape-induced anisotropy makes the magnetophorestic
force expression more complicated for an ellipsoidal particle
than it is for a sphere. For the special case of a prolate par-
ticle (a = b < c) aligned with its long axis parallel to and
positioned on the axis of an axially symmetric ﬁeld, the mag-
netophorestic force expression resembles that for a sphere,

where µ1 is the permeability of the particle, µ2 is the per-
meability of the host medium, and gL is the longitudinal de-
magnetizing factor. From the above equation, we can ﬁnd that
the force remains proportional to the scalar product of particle
volume and excess permeability. Ellipsoidal particles exhibit

force on the nonmagnetic particle in the ferroﬂuid due to the
nonuniform magnetic ﬁeld can be affected signiﬁcantly by the
lattice effect, the volume fraction and shape of the nonmag-

inverse ferroﬂuid, volume fraction and shape of the nonmag-
netic particle by measuring such magnetophoretic force.

This expression is also valid for oblate spheroids (a < b = c),
though such a particle with its short axis parallel to the mag-

ticle, k = 1 and gL = 1/3, in which case Eq.(19) reduces to
Eq. (4).

For certain lattice, such as bct, bcc and f cc, the relation
between F1 and the aspect ratio k are shown in Fig. ?? and
Fig. ??. The absolute value of the magnetophoretic force on
the nonmagnetic particle decreases as k increases for both pro-
late and oblate cases. In addition, the relation between F1 and
the volume fraction of the nonmagnetic particles is also inves-
tigated. The results are shown in Fig. ?? and Fig. ??. The ab-
solute value of the magnetophoretic force on the nonmagnetic
particle decreases as the volume fraction increases, which are
consistent with the result of the spherical case. We can calcu-
late the transverse case by using the sum rules 2αT + αL = 3
and 2gT + gL = 1. There are no ﬁgures shown here for such
case.

III. CONCLUSIONS

In fact, Magnetophoresis is a complicated phenomenon.
Such as magnetophoresis with eddy current induction, which
is corresponding to the electrically conductive magnetizable
particle.
In our present work, we only study the magne-
tophoretic force on the nonmagnetic particles (or magnetic
holes) suspended in a host ferroﬂuid, by taking into account
the effect of structural transition and long-range interaction
(lattice effect). So we resort to the Ewald-Kornfeld formu-
lation and the well-known developed Maxwell-Garnett the-
ory to calculate the effective permeability of the inverse fer-
roﬂuid. And we also consider the effects of the volume frac-
tion and geometric shape of the nonmagnetic particles to the
magnetophoretic force on the nonmagnetic particles.
It is
found that the absolute value of the magnetophoretic force on
the nonmagnetic particle decreases as the volume fraction in-
creases. For nonspherical case, the absolute value of the mag-
netophoretic force on the nonmagnetic particle decreases as
the aspect ratio(k) increases.

As the nonmagnetic particles are located closely, the multi-
polar interaction between them is expected to play a role [23,
24]. In this regard, it is of value to extend the present work to
investigate the effect of the multipolar interaction. In addition,
it is also interesting to see what happens if the external ﬁeld is
a nonuniform ac magnetic ﬁeld and the nonmagnetic particle
is inhomogeneous.

To sum up, our results have shown that the magnetophoretic

Abstract

Taking into account the structural transition and long-range interaction (lattice effect), we resort to

the Ewald-Kornfeld formulation and the well-known developed Maxwell-Garnett theory for uniaxially

anisotropic suspensions to calculate the effective permeability of the inverse ferroﬂuid. And we also con-

sider the effects of the volume fraction and geometric shape of the nonmagnetic particles to the magne-

tophoretic force on the nonmagnetic particles. It is found that the absolute value of the magnetophoretic

force decreases as the volume fraction increases. For nonspherical case, the absolute value of the magne-

tophoretic force decreases as the aspect ratio (k) increases.

INTRODUCTION

Magnetizable particles experience a force in a nonuniform magnetic ﬁeld, which comes from

the interaction between the induced dipole moment inside the particles and the external nonuni-

form magnetic ﬁeld. This phenomenon, sometimes called magnetophoresis (MAP ), which has

been exploited in a variety of industrial and commercial process for separation and beneﬁciation

of solids suspended in liquids [1]. The nonmagnetic particle suspended in the ferroﬂuid possesses

magnetic moment, so it also experiences a force in a nonuniform magnetic ﬁeld. Magnetophoresis

may open up an approach to characterize and separate cells for biochemical analysis based on

intrinsic and extrinsic magnetic properties of biological macromolecules [2].

In recent years, inverse ferroﬂuids with nonmagnetic colloidal particles (or magnetic holes)

suspended in a ferroﬂuid have drawn much attention for their potential industrial and biomedical

applications [3, 4, 5, 6]. The size of the nonmagnetic particle (such as polystyrene particle) is

about 1

100µm. Ferroﬂuid, also known as magnetic ﬂuid, is a colloidal suspension of single-

∼

domain magnetic particles, with typical dimension around 10nm, dispersed in a liquid carrier

[7, 8]. Since the nonmagnetic particles are much larger than the magnetic nanoparticles, the mag-

netic ﬂuid can be treated as a one-component continuum with respect to the larger nonmagnetic

particles [9, 10]. Recently, Jian, Huang and Tao ﬁrst theoretically suggested that the ground state

of inverse ferroﬂuid is body-centered tetragonal (bct) lattice [11], just as the ground states of

electrorheological ﬂuids and magnetorheological ﬂuids [12, 13]. Here, we propose an alternative

structural transition from the bct to the face-centered cubic (f cc), through the application of exter-

nal magnetic ﬁeld. Then, we apply a nonuniform magnetic ﬁeld to investigate the magnetophoresis

of the nonmagnetic particles submerged in the ferroﬂuid. In fact, one has investigated the force

on the microparticles in electrorheological solids under the application of a nonuniform ac elec-

tric ﬁeld by using a self-consistent method and the spectral representation approach [14]. In our

present work, we use the Ewald-Kornfeld formulation and the well-known developed Maxwell-

Garnett theory for uniaxially anisotropic suspensions to calculate the effective permeability of the

inverse ferroﬂuid, considering the lattice effect, the volume fraction and shape of the nonmagnetic

particle. Based on this, the magnetophoretic force on the nonmagnetic particle can be calculated.

This paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we introduce the theory of magnetophoresis. By

using the Ewald-Kornfeld formulation and the well-known developed Maxwell-Garnett theory for

uniaxially anisotropic suspensions, we calculate the effective permeability of the inverse ferroﬂu-

2

ids. And we investigate the magnetophoretic force on the nonmagnetic particles in ferroﬂuids.

This paper ends with a conclusion in Sec. III.

II. THEORY AND FORMALISM

A. Theory of magnetophoresis

Let us ﬁrst consider the magnetically linear particles. For a magnetically linear particle, the

effective magnetic dipole moment vector ~mef f takes a form very similar to that for the effective

dipole moment of dielectric sphere,

(3)

(4)

~mef f = 4πR3K(µ1, µ2) ~H0 ,

K(µ1, µ2) =

µ1
µ2

µ1 + 2µ2

,

where R is the radius of the magnetically linear particle, µ1 is the permeability of the magnetically

linear particle, and µ2 is the permeability of the host medium. The force exerted by a nonuniform

magnetic ﬁeld on a magnetic dipole ,

~Fdipole = µ2 ~mef f · ∇

H0 ,

Combining this expression with that for the effective magnetic dipole moment, the magne-

tophoretic force exerted on a magnetizable spherical particle in a nonuniform magnetic ﬁeld can

be written as [1],

~FM AP = 2πµ2R3K(µ1, µ2)

H 2
0 ,

∇

Eq. (4) is similar to the expression of the dielectrophoretic force on particles. The magne-

tophoretic force on particles are proportional to the particle volume and the permeability of the

suspension medium. And the force is directed along the gradient of the magnetic ﬁeld intensity.

There are two kinds of magnetophoresis depending upon the relative magnitudes of µ1 and µ2. If

K > 0 (µ1 > µ2), particles are attracted to magnetic ﬁeld intensity maxima and repelled from min-

ima. This phenomenon is called positive magnetophoresis. On the contrary, if K < 0 (µ1 < µ2),

particles are attracted to magnetic ﬁeld intensity minima and repelled from maxima. This case

is called negative magnetophoresis. Now, we consider the nonlinear magnetophoresis. There are

3

two kinds of nonlinear magnetophoresis. The ﬁrst case is ferromagnetic particles in a linear mag-

netizable medium. The other one is nonmagnetic particles in a magnetizable liquid, such as a

ferroﬂuid. In both cases, The magnetic ﬁeld is assumed to be dc and hysteresis is ignored. In

this work, the second case will be considered. For the reason that the magnetic nonlinearity of

ferroﬂuid causes difﬁculties in calculating the effective magnetic moment for an immersed non-

magnetic particle. Therefore, we use a Maxwell stress tensor formulation to predict the magnetic
force ~Ff f on nonmagnetic immersed particles,

~Ff f =

Where Σ is the surface that just encloses the object, H0 is the magnitude of the nonuniform mag-
~M ( ~H) is

·

the normal component of the magnetization in the ferroﬂuid adjacent to the surface Σ enclosing

the particle. In a weak magnetic ﬁeld, we can use Eq. (4) by setting µ1 = µ0 to calculate the

magnetophorestic force on the nonmagnetic particles submerged in a ferroﬂuid.

B. Effective permeability

The effective permeability can be obtained by performing an Ewald-Kornfeld formulation so

that the structural transition and long-range interaction can be taken into account explicitly. The

ground state of inverse ferroﬂuid is a body-centered-tetragonal (bct) lattice, which can be regarded

as a tetragonal lattice, plus a basis of two particles each of which is ﬁxed with an induced point

magnetic dipole at its center. One of the two particles is located at a corner and the other one at

the body center of the tetragonal unit cell. The tetragonal lattice has a lattice constant c1= ξq along
the z axis and lattice constants a1 = b1 = ξq− 1

2 along x and y axes respectively. In this paper we

identiﬁed a different structure transformation from the bct to f cc by changing the uniaxial lattice

constant c1 under hard-sphere constraint. The volume of the tetragonal unit cell remains certain
value (ξ3) as q varies. In this way, the degree of anisotropy of tetragonal lattice is measured by

how q is deviated from unity and the uniaxial anisotropic axis is along the z axis. In particular,

q = 0.87358, 1 and 2

3 represent the bct, bcc and f cc lattice, respectively.

When an external magnetic ﬁeld ~H0 is along the x axis, the induced dipole moment ~m are
perpendicular to the uniaxial anisotropic axis. At the lattice point ~R=0, the local ﬁeld ~HL can be

determined by using the Ewald-Kornfeld formulation [15, 16, 17],

and αT denotes the local ﬁeld in transverse ﬁeld case. Here the longitudinal (or transverse) ﬁeld

It should be noted that Eq. (13) is ﬁt for the case of the spherical nonmagnetic particle. For the

cases of nonsphere (such as prolate and oblate spheroids), we resort to the demagnetizing factor g

to describe the shape of spheroids. For a prolate spheroid, there is a = b < c, where a, b, c are

three principal axes of the spheriods, and the longitudinal demagnetizing factor gL along the major

axis c is,

It is worth mentioning the negative sign.

In our

calculation, we choose the parameters µ1 = 1.0, µ2 = 2.9 (The permeability of the nonmagnetic

particle is µ0, and the permeability of the typical ferroﬂuid is about 2.9 µ0 ). In this case, the

parameter K < 0 is corresponding to the negative magnetophoresis. As a matter of fact, we want

to obtain the absolute value of the magnetophoretic force on the nonmagnetic particle.

Figure 1 displays the dependence of F on q when the external magnetic ﬁeld is parallel to the

uniaxial anisotropic axis for three different volume fractions f=0.15, f=0.25 and f=0.35. While

Figure 2 shows the dependence of F on q when the external magnetic ﬁeld is perpendicular to the

uniaxial anisotropic axis for three different volume fractions f=0.15, f=0.25 and f=0.35. The two

ﬁgures show that the magnetophoretic force on the nonmagnetic particles are different according

to different lattices. Because of the anisotropy, Fig.1 displays that F decreases as q increases.

Inverse behavior appears in Fig2. Without the effect of the structural transition and the long-range

interaction (lattice effect), F equals to 0.81029. With the effect, take the bcc lattice for example,

F equals to 0.64797 when the volume fraction equals to 0.15. The difference between the above

two cases is large, which means that the lattice effect plays an important role in Magnetophoresis

of nonmagnetic particles in ferroﬂuids.

Now, let us focus our interest on the effect of the volume fraction to the magnetophoretic force

on the nonmagnetic particles. Fig. ?? represents the relation between F and q for different volume

fractions of the nonmagnetic particles. It shows that the absolute value of the magnetophoretic

force on the nonmagnetic particles decreases as the volume fraction increases. The relation be-

tween F and f for the external magnetic ﬁeld parallel to the uniaxial anisotropic axis is similar to

that of the external magnetic ﬁeld perpendicular to the uniaxial anisotropic axis, (see Fig. 2). As

the volume fraction of the nonmagnetic particles increases, the lattice effect becomes stronger. By

using the well-known developed Maxwell-Garnett theory for uniaxially anisotropic suspensions, a

smaller effective permeability of the inverse ferroﬂuid can be obtained. Consequently, the absolute

value of the magnetophoretic force on the nonmagnetic particles becomes smaller.

7

Shape-induced anisotropy makes the magnetophorestic force expression more complicated for

an ellipsoidal particle than it is for a sphere. For the special case of a prolate particle (a = b < c)

aligned with its long axis parallel to and positioned on the axis of an axially symmetric ﬁeld, the

magnetophorestic force expression resembles that for a sphere,

where µ1 is the permeability of the particle, µ2 is the permeability of the host medium, and

gL is the longitudinal demagnetizing factor. From the above equation, we can ﬁnd that the force

remains proportional to the scalar product of particle volume and excess permeability. Ellipsoidal

particles exhibit the same positive and negative magnetophoresis phenomenology, depending on

whether µ1 is greater than or less than µ2. This expression is also valid for oblate spheroids

(a < b = c), though such a particle with its short axis parallel to the magnetic ﬁeld will be in

unstable alignment. For a spherical particle, k = 1 and gL = 1/3, in which case Eq.(19) reduces

to Eq. (4).

In order to calculate the magnetophoretic force on the nonmagnetic particles, the lattice ef-

fect must be considered. So µ2 should be substituted by µe. In this paper, for convenience, F1

stands for

netophoretic force. Here, we assume the volume of the nonmagnetic particle is invariable, and

H 2

0 is a constant across the nonmagnetic particles.

For certain lattice, such as bct, bcc and f cc, the relation between F1 and the aspect ratio k are

shown in Fig. ?? and Fig. ??. The absolute value of the magnetophoretic force on the nonmagnetic

particle decreases as k increases for both prolate and oblate cases. In addition, the relation between

F1 and the volume fraction of the nonmagnetic particles is also investigated. The results are shown

in Fig. ?? and Fig. ??. The absolute value of the magnetophoretic force on the nonmagnetic

particle decreases as the volume fraction increases, which are consistent with the result of the

spherical case. We can calculate the transverse case by using the sum rules 2αT + αL = 3 and

2gT + gL = 1. There are no ﬁgures shown here for such case.

III. CONCLUSIONS

In fact, Magnetophoresis is a complicated phenomenon. Such as magnetophoresis with eddy

current induction, which is corresponding to the electrically conductive magnetizable particle. In

8

our present work, we only study the magnetophoretic force on the nonmagnetic particles (or mag-

netic holes) suspended in a host ferroﬂuid, by taking into account the effect of structural transition

and long-range interaction (lattice effect). So we resort to the Ewald-Kornfeld formulation and

the well-known developed Maxwell-Garnett theory to calculate the effective permeability of the

inverse ferroﬂuid. And we also consider the effects of the volume fraction and geometric shape of

the nonmagnetic particles to the magnetophoretic force on the nonmagnetic particles. It is found

that the absolute value of the magnetophoretic force on the nonmagnetic particle decreases as the

volume fraction increases. For nonspherical case, the absolute value of the magnetophoretic force

on the nonmagnetic particle decreases as the aspect ratio(k) increases.

As the nonmagnetic particles are located closely, the multipolar interaction between them is ex-

pected to play a role [23, 24]. In this regard, it is of value to extend the present work to investigate

the effect of the multipolar interaction. In addition, it is also interesting to see what happens if the

external ﬁeld is a nonuniform ac magnetic ﬁeld and the nonmagnetic particle is inhomogeneous.

To sum up, our results have shown that the magnetophoretic force on the nonmagnetic particle

in the ferroﬂuid due to the nonuniform magnetic ﬁeld can be affected signiﬁcantly by the lattice

effect, the volume fraction and shape of the nonmagnetic particle. Thus, it is possible to detect

the structure of the inverse ferroﬂuid, volume fraction and shape of the nonmagnetic particle by

measuring such magnetophoretic force.

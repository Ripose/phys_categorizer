The empirical valence bond (EVB) method [J. Chem. Phys. 52, 1262 (1970)] has always embodied
charge transfer processes. The mechanism of that behavior is examined here and recast for use as
a new empirical potential energy surface for large-scale simulations. A two-state model is explored.
The main features of the model are: (1) Explicit decomposition of the total system electron density is
invoked; (2) The charge is deﬁned through the density decomposition into constituent contributions;
(3) The charge transfer behavior is controlled through the resonance energy matrix elements which
cannot be ignored; and (4) A reference-state approach, similar in spirit to the EVB method, is
used to deﬁne the resonance state energy contributions in terms of “knowable” quantities. With
equal validity, the new potential energy can be expressed as a nonthermal ensemble average with
a nonlinear but analytical charge dependence in the occupation number. Dissociation to neutral
species for a gas-phase process is preserved. A variant of constrained search density functional
theory is advocated as the preferred way to deﬁne an energy for a given charge.

INTRODUCTION

Charge transfer is ubiquitous in physical processes af-
fecting biological, chemical, and materials systems. The
representation of charge transfer is of intense current in-
terest throughout the physical sciences. A powerful con-
cept in both modeling and understanding how charges re-
distribute themselves during a physical process is chemi-
cal potential equalization.1–6 To apply chemical potential
equalization successfully, it is essential to use a charge-
dependent energy model which behaves correctly for all
conﬁgurations encountered in the process of interest.

Consider a diatomic molecule AB. Atom A is assumed
to be more electropositive than atom B. We are interested
in charge disproportionation reactions typiﬁed by

where the charge q is not necessarily an integer. Charge
disproportionation and transfer reactions are impor-
tant in electron transfer in biophysical systems,7–9 en-
zyme catalysis reactions,10,11 and such processes as
electron-hole production and recombination in organic
semiconductors.12 For dimers (B = A), Eq. (1) cor-
responds to broken charge-symmetry states. Further-
more, Eqs. (1) and (2) have been the prototype reac-
tions for a wide variety of theoretical studies of chemical
bonding.3,13–20

The most prevalent model potential for charged species
is the quadratic expansion of the classical electrostatic
potential,4,6,21–23

The Ei(R) are expansion coeﬃcients which are atom-
type dependent and V (R) is an interionic potential repre-
senting the classical electrostatic contribution. In general
all of these functions depend on the separation R. The
charge q is usually, but not always, independent of R.
V (R) approaches a 1/R dependence at suﬃciently large
R. E0(R) contains the charge-independent short-range
and dispersion interactions between the atoms. The
other expansion coeﬃcients are frequently interpreted in
terms of physical quantities such as chemical potential
and hardness.4–6,24–31 The quadratic form has the virtue
of simplicity and works adequately when the range of R
is small enough to prevent q from changing appreciably.
If Eq. (3) is used at all separations, the atoms in the
AB molecule will remain ionic even at separations where
they are supposed to return to neutral states. For those
situations where charge transfer does occur, alternative
functional forms of charge dependence need to be in-
voked. For instance, Alavi et al.21 and Grochowski and
coworkers32 use phenomenological switching functions to
eﬀect charge transfer. At very large separations, though,
it is known that the charge dependence becomes piece-
wise linear (Fig. 1).2,19,33

Morales and Martinez34 (hereafter referred to as MM)
conclude that the “grand canonical” (GC) approach2
cannot describe a realistic charge transfer process. In the
GC approach each atom is considered to be an open sys-

FIG. 1: Comparison of piecewise linear and quadratic mod-
els of the charge dependence of the energy for a diatomic.
The solid line corresponds to the energy of the isolated atoms
as a function of acquired charge q (measured with respect
to charge transfer from the cation). The dashed curve cor-
responds to a quadratic representation of the charge depen-
dence. The energy minimizes at q = 0 for the piecewise linear
model, but not for the quadratic model. At large separa-
tions, the piecewise linear model is correct. Traditionally the
quadratic model is considered to be more correct at ﬁnite
separations.

tem with respect to exchange of energy and numbers of
electrons. They use a 3-state model with integer charge
resonances representing the states of the ensemble for
each atom. For atom A for instance, the GC energy is
expressed in the form of an ensemble average

EGC

A ≈

ωA0 EA0 + ωA+ EA+ + ωA−EA− ,

(4)

where ωAσ are the occupation numbers and EAσ are the
energies for the integer charge species σ = +, 0, and
.
−
The ωAσ depend on q and are equal to or greater than
zero. (See Refs. 26, 34, and 35 for the detailed expres-
sions.) MM show that the GC energy as expressed by
Eq. (4) minimizes to integer charges, and never to frac-
tional charges. When the two atoms are well separated
and only weakly interacting, the covalent and ionic reso-
nance states can be regarded as being close to eigenfunc-
tions and the mixing terms between the states can be
ignored. The nonlinearities in the occupation numbers
as functions of charge introduced through temperature
at physically reasonable temperatures are not suﬃcient
to produce states with fractional charges. Thus charge
transfer as represented by an ensemble of weakly inter-
acting integer-charge states is too simplistic to describe
fractionally charged states.

MM also examine a 3-state valence bond (VB) ap-
proach usqing the same resonance states as in the GC

2

approach. This is equivalent to a 0 K ensemble where
the states are allowed to interact. The VB approach
is able to represent charge transfer processes with frac-
tional charges. However, the representation of the en-
ergy depends on resonance matrix elements. The issue
becomes one of deﬁning sets of coeﬃcients for the state
wavefunctions that allow one to recover quadratic and
GC-like energy expressions. Using Coulson charges36–38
as an approximation and a maximum entropy valence
bond approach (MEVB), MM derive energy expressions
as functions of q with the forms of Eqs. (3) and (4). In
the MEVB approach, decomposition into atomic contri-
butions is accomplished through an examination of the
various matrix elements appearing in the total energy
expression. However, MM were unable to ﬁnd a gen-
eral expression linking the GC and classical electrostatic
forms.

The three main diﬃculties in deriving a charge depen-
dent potential are the same ones facing MM and others.
First is to deﬁne the charge, second is to evaluate or elim-
inate the resonance energy matrix elements, and third is
to deﬁne the energy for a particular value of q. First,
to deﬁne q, we invoke a density-functional-theory39–41
(DFT) motivated atom-in-molecule18,42,43 pseudo-atom
concept within the context of the EVB approach. We
assume the availability of a practical density decomposi-
tion strategy18,43–48 to deﬁne the pseudo-atom densities.
The charge is deﬁned as an average over the diﬀerence
between two pseudo-atom densities. No restriction to
Coulson36 or other deﬁnitions of charge49,50 is necessary.
The dependence of the EVB wavefunction on q is then de-
duced, which in turn yields an energy for arbitrary q, not
just the optimum q. Second, to evaluate resonance en-
ergy matrix elements, we retain the VB approach of MM,
but use an empirical valence bond (EVB)32,51,52 strategy,
rather than explicitly evaluating a model Hamiltonian or
using the MEVB averaging procedure of MM. Speciﬁ-
cally, a reference energy is separated out for a ﬁxed value
of q. To deﬁne the energy for an atom in the molecule, we
require consistency between the EVB wavefunction en-
ergy and DFT energy for each atom. In so doing we are
able to cast the energy of each atom into a form suitable
for constructing empirical potential energy surfaces that
could be used in simulations of larger systems. Third,
the typical situation is that there are many wavefuctions
and many electron densities that are consistent with a
particular q. To deﬁne a unique energy from among the
possible choices, we adhere to constrained search density
functional theory (CS-DFT)41,53 rather than appealing
to a maximum entropy principle.

To the best of our knowledge, the EVB method has
not previously been combined with an atom-in-molecule
approach.31 von Szentp´aly and coworkers deﬁne atomic
charges, but their deﬁnition is implicitly limited to a
quadratic dependence.27–29 Grochowski and coworkers32
use EVB parameterized by ab initio calculations for key
molecular fragments and for deﬁning the charges. The
charges are deﬁned with a phenomenological spatial de-

pendence that does maintain correct dissociation to neu-
trals. Furthermore, the charge dependence of the ﬁnal
potential is purely electrostatic.

The inconsistency between the GC and classical elec-
trostatic forms is explained in Cios lowski and Stefanov19
using a diﬀerent deﬁnition of q, which is based on the
total system wavefunction. The charge is expressed as
a perturbation on the molecular Hamiltonian H. Com-
puted atom-in-molecule equilibrium charges are used in
subsequent “charge-constrained” calculations to study
the energy and electronegativity dependences about the
ground-state atom-in-molecule charges. Nalewajski33
provides a simpliﬁed rendition of Cios lowski and Ste-
fanov, but only for orthogonal resonance states. While
physically correct, these eﬀorts have not been cast in the
form of general purpose potential energy surfaces. In par-
ticular, neither attempts to resolve the resonance energy
issue in a way that is tractable for large-scale simulations.
Here we derive a charge-dependent empirical poten-
tial which faithfully represents charge transfer as a func-
tion of separation between atom A and an entity B. In
the simplest case, entity B is another atom. More gen-
erally, B represents a collective embedding environment
or reservior.2,16 The charge may be fractional. Our pri-
mary interest is in deriving a general functional form with
correct physical and chemical behavior at all interaction
strengths rather than providing an exact treatment of
particular terms or systems. The three diﬃculties just
outlined are addressed. We then analyze these potentials
in special limiting cases and in the light of the results of
Cios lowski and Stefanov19 and Nalewajski.33 Finally, we
derive general models for both pair potentials and atom-
in-molecule energies.

II. THE EMPIRICAL VALENCE BOND
REPRESENTATION

The EVB method is a much more general technique
than described here. Reviews of EVB are available from
Warshel et. al.52 Here we conﬁne our discussion to a 2-
state model of the AB molecule. There are ﬁxed covalent
and ionic resonance states represented by wavefunctions
ψc and ψi, respectively.32,52,54,55 No assumption is made
about the quality of these wavefunctions. However, ψc
retains NA0 electrons on atom A and NB0 electrons on
atom B. Atoms A and B are neutral in the covalent res-
onance state. Consequently NA0 and NB0 are equal to
their respective nuclear charges, ZA and ZB. Similarly,
ψi retains NA0
1 electrons on atom A and NB0 + 1
electrons on atom B. In each resonance state, the total
number of electrons is N . ψc and ψi are assumed to be
normalized to unity. The wavefunction of the system ψ
is the combination36–38,56–58

If ψc and ψi are nondegenerate
eigenfunctions of H, then Hci = Sci = 0. There is either
no charge transfer or there is complete charge transfer.
In either case, the states do not mix.

The coeﬃcient γ governs the ionic contribution to ψ.
As γ increases, ψ migrates toward more complete charge
transfer. Even neglecting overlap,51,52 the ionic strength
γ interpolates between covalent and ionic states in a phys-
ically reasonable way.57 The state-to-state interpolating
behavior of γ in Eq. (13) is the essential behavior that we
wish to emulate in developing a more broadly applicable
charge dependent potential.

Later in the paper, two other relationships will be-
come useful, which we provide here. First, in the spirit
of EVB,52 one always wants to know the resonance en-
ergy in the terms of the ground-state Egs, Sci, Hcc, and
Hii. That is,

III. CHARGE IN THE 2-STATE EVB MODEL

We begin with the question of how to deﬁne charge in
our model. There is no unique deﬁnition of the charge on
an atom in a molecule. To assign charges to individual
atoms, we assume that it is possible to decompose the
total electron density into pseudo-atom densities. How-
ever, we do not need to specify a particular decomposi-
tion procedure at this time. We only need to know that
some procedure is available.18,43–48

A. Deﬁnition of Charge

To deﬁne the charge, it is convenient to use N -electron
density matrices and 1-electron densities.
In terms of
density matrix language, the state of AB is represented
as

Γ(r′

N , rN ) = ψ(r′

N ) ψ(rN ) ,

(16)

where rN are the 3N dimensional spatial electronic coor-
dinates for the full AB system and ψ is given in Eq. (5).
Spin is ignored at this point and, for simplicity, the ma-
trix elements are assumed to be real. Eq. (16) corre-
sponds to the pure-state representation of the density
matrix for the 2-state model. We can expand Eq. (16)
in terms of the covalent and ionic states, resulting in the
relationship

Γ = αcc Γcc + 2 αci Γci + αii Γii ,

(17)

where

and

c ,

Γcc = ψ2
Γci = ψc ψi ,
Γii = ψ2
αcc = 1/(1 + 2 γ Sci + γ2) ,
αci = γ/(1 + 2 γ Sci + γ2) ,

i ,

αii = γ2/(1 + 2 γ Sci + γ2) .

4

The total electronic energy expression analogous to
Eq. (17) is

E = αcc Hcc + 2 αci Hci + αii Hii .

(18)

Eq. (18) corresponds to a non-diagonal representation of
the energy. Its advantage is that the component contri-
butions of the essential states that are thought to rep-
resent the physical system are delineated. A diagonal
representation of Γ when state mixing is important can
be devised by diagonalizing H. For the purposes of
extending the present treatment to ﬁnite temperature
ensembles,2,34,35,59 this particular diagonalization of Γ
would be useful.

The N -electron densities of interest are ρ, ρcc, ρci, and
ρii. They bear the usual relationships to the respective
N -electron density matrices, Γστ :

ρστ (r) = N

drN −1 Γστ (rN , rN ) ,

(19)

Z

where rN −1 are the 3(N -1) dimensional spatial electronic
coordinates and στ is either “cc”, “ci”, “ii”, or no sub-
script. ρ, ρcc, and ρii are normalized to N . The relation-
ship of central interest is

ρ = αcc ρcc + 2 αci ρci + αii ρii
ρcc + 2 γ ρci + γ2ρii
1 + 2 γ Sci + γ2

=

.

(20)

Recall the assumption that the covalent and ionic state
wavefunctions are given and ﬁxed. Thus the total density
ρ is determined solely by the value of γ.

The energies of ρcc and ρii are well-deﬁned in a con-
ventional DFT sense.39,41 However, the “interference
density”60 ρci does not have a well-deﬁned energy in
DFT. Nevertheless, its energy may be inferred from the
energies of ρ, ρcc, and ρii, as we will show below.

Next we assume that all of the ρστ can be decom-

With these deﬁnitions in place, we deﬁne q from either
pair of total and covalent pseudo-atom densities, which
others have sometimes referred to as pseudo-atom distor-

The density decompositions must be constrained to
yield the correct number of electrons prescribed by
Eq. (22).61–63 Finally, we note that the present deﬁni-
tion of q falls into Truhlar’s Class II category.64,65

Now we want to eliminate γ in favor of q. Assuming
A(r) based on Eq. (20)

that a component deﬁnition of ρ∗

NA0 is the number of electrons on atom A when it is in

a neutral state, and the relationship N Sci =

ci,A is determined by the
diﬀerence between ρ∗
ci,A and the atom A component of
the decomposition of ρci with locally unbiased, electron-
number decomposition.63 Clearly, diﬀerent density de-
composition strategies will yield somewhat diﬀerent val-
ues of δN ∗
ci,A is
to require consistency with the ground-state value of γ.
For instance, if q = 0 is optimum as for a dimer, γ equals
either 0 or 2 δN ∗
ci,A. For Eq. (23) to be applied suc-
cessfully, 2 δN ∗
ci,A would have to correspond to a lower
energy state than γ = 0 and the value of γ would have to
be determined from a separate calculation, such as rep-
resented by Eq. (13). In such an approach, one would
be eﬀectively modeling δN ∗
ci,A via a correspondence with
the Coulson-Fischer transition.57 Alternatively, by anal-
ogy with ρ, we assume that single-particle determinants
(e.g. Kohn-Sham determinants40) can be calculated for
the ρ∗
σσ,A.47,66–68 In a Kohn-Sham based approach, one
would be eﬀectively estimating ρ∗
ci,A from the overlaps
of these determinants. Additional ambiguity in δN ∗
ci,A
arises from the choices for ψc and ψi. These ambiguities
lie behind the designation of the present approach as an
empirical one. However, these ambiguities can be miti-
gated by using a reference state as discussed in the next
Subsection. To that end, it is useful to invert Eq. (23)
so that δN ∗
ci,A becomes a function of q and γ. That re-
lationship is

charge on separation for some reference state. Some em-
pirical potentials such as EVB and the modiﬁed embed-
ded atom method (MEAM)69–71 utilize reference states
as a model calibration method. The methods of Mc-
Donald and coworkers,21 McCammon, Grochowski, and
coworkers,32 and Broughton and Mehl55 eﬀectively make
q bond-length dependent. Eq. (23) provides a basis in
EVB theory for their phenomenological charge transfer
switching functions.

A more attractive option is to solve for γ = γ(q),

(26)
The coeﬃcient γ determines the strength of the contri-
bution of ψi to ψ. Eq. (26) states how the charge gov-
erns that strength. This expression is consistent with the
results of Cios lowski and Stefanov,19 which are derived
from a perturbative technique. As noted previously, even
if q = 0, γ equals either 0 or 2 δN ∗
ci,A. This is because
the EVB model describes state mixing even when there is
no charge transfer. For example, in the H2 molecule, the
covalent and ionic wavefunctions mix at all ﬁnite separa-
tions, but the ground state never involves charge transfer.
Signiﬁcantly, this formula also describes deviations from
the ground-state charge.

Eq. (26) can be substituted into Eq. (9), and the vari-
ational procedure repeated. The result is the same as
solving for q in terms of the resonance and overlap ma-
trix elements obtained by equating Eq. (26) and (13).

The EVB strategy is to use experimental information
to eliminate the resonance energy.51,52 Here the analo-
gous procedure is to choose a particular value of q = q0
and solve for Hci in terms of E(q0) and the diagonal
matrix elements for each R. (The R dependence is sup-
pressed.) The result is

Hci =

E(q0)

−

αcc(q0) Hcc −
2 αci(q0)

.

(27)

To construct a potential energy surface for AB, one
option is to use Eq. (23) to model the dependence of the

Substituting Eq. (27) into Eq. (18), the total energy for
arbitrary q > 0 has the form

E(q) = (αci(q)/αci(q0)) E(q0) + (αcc(q)

αcc(q0) αci(q)/αci(q0)) Hcc + (αii(q)

αii(q0) αci(q)/αci(q0)) Hii .

(28)

−

−

This form might be used in lieu of classical electro-
static potentials like Eq. (3) that have been in common
use. It has the structure of an ensemble average,2 but
the coeﬃcients of Hcc and Hii are not necessarily posi-
tive semideﬁnite. Eq. (28) is constructed to possess the
proper changes in atomic charges in the limit of molecu-
lar dissociation. The construction of a proper ensemble
representation is discussed in Section 5.A.

The foundations for the quadratic dependence of the
energy on charge, such as Eq. (3), must stem from
Eqs. (26) and (9). However, even this simplest exam-
ple of charge transfer has a considerably more complex
dependence than quadratic. That dependence is clearly
carried through the overlap contributions.

Once q0 has been chosen, the procedure for determin-
ing a point on the potential energy surface for arbitrary
values of R and q is as follows. From some other source(s)
of information, one must have available ﬁve reference val-
ues: E(q0), its associated ionicity γ0, Hcc, Hii, and Sci.
For a chosen R, one ﬁrst evaluates

Eq. (28) remains the same structurally. Equivalently, one
could replace the subscript “A” with the subscript “B”
everywhere in the procedure. The potential over the en-
tire range of q is then represented in a piecewise fashion.
While not as rigorous as a 3-state model, the present
treatment does retain substantially greater simplicity.

Another possible extension is to apply the above pro-
cedure when the two resonance states both correspond
to charged species. For CaO, for example, the eﬀective
q on Ca near equilibrium would be almost +2. As the
CaO bond is stretched, q would decrease until it passed
through a region of undetermined length where it would
range between +1 and 0. Then there would be one form
of Eq. (28) covering the range in q between 0 and +1
and a second form covering the range between +1 and
+2 range.

A ﬁnal extension of this model would allow the entity

one other atom. Most of the model presented here does
not explicitly invoke the speciﬁc properties of a diatomic
model. However, this extension requires separate consid-
erations not pursued here.

(d) γ(q) from Eq. (26) using values from Steps (a), (b),

IV. DEFINITION OF PSEUDO-ATOM
ENERGIES

The procedure is repeated for each value of R of interest.
An important question is what to choose for q0. One
possible choice for q0 is the optimum value qopt. How-
ever, qopt depends on Hci through Eqs. (13) and (23).
This variant is equivalent to using the ground-state wave-
function as one of the basis functions in the original for-
mulation of the problem. Eq. (28) then characterizes
deviations of the energy from the ground-state energy,
E(qopt), as a function of q. Note that by choosing E(q0)
to be consistent with E(qopt), this variant and Eq. (28)
will be identical.

When q0 = qopt, the procedure for determining a point
on the potential energy surface is substantially the same
as the ﬁrst. Again ﬁve reference values are needed, except
that knowledge of qopt replaces knowledge of γ0. Rela-
tive to the ﬁrst procedure, Steps (a) and (b) become to
evaluate

(a) Hci from Eq. (14); and

(b) γopt(qopt) from Eq. (13).

All of the other steps remain the same.

One can extend this model to q between

1 and 0. The

We now show how to deﬁne pseudo-atom energies for
the 2-state model of the previous section. We do this by
requiring consistency between the energies based on the
density decompositions that were assumed in the previ-
ous Section and the energies that would result from the
corresponding wavefunction expressions. As with ρ, we
assume that there is a decomposition Γ into pseudo-atom
density matrices. In conformance with Rychlewski and
Parr,72 the decomposition applies to Γ rather than to H.
Thus, for

that all of the energies in traditional EVB are 0 K val-
ues. Some variations of EVB incorporate temperature-
dependent solvent eﬀects.52 We do not include these vari-
ations here. Finite temperatures are not required to es-
tablish the model. On the other hand, there is nothing
here that precludes extending the analysis to a ﬁnite tem-
perature ensemble.2,16,33,34,59

Substituting Eq. (34) into Eq. (33), an expression for

the pseudo-atom energy is achieved. For any q,

Eq. (35) has the same structure as Eqs. (28), but refers
to an individual atom. All of the quantities on the right-
hand sides of these two equations can be deduced from
experiment and/or decomposition calculations on reso-
nance states and overlaps.

Using the present formulations in simulations of larger
systems naturally invokes consideration of chemical po-
tential equalization. One can obtain a statement of chem-
ical potential equalization from Eq. (35). The total en-
ergy is given in Eq. (30). If E is minimized with respect
to q, then small deviations from qopt will not change the
total energy to ﬁrst order:

where µ is the chemical potential. Charge balance re-
quires that the charges on A and B be exactly opposite.

electrons on A.

V. DISCUSSION AND EXAMPLES

Here we introduce approximations consistent with the
dissociation limits of AB, present a general deﬁnition of
the energy for a given charge, and discuss H2, HF, and
LiH as examples.

A. Neglect of Diﬀerential Overlap Model

It is insightful to introduce a concept of neglect of dif-
ferential overlap between resonance states, ρci = 0, which
we will refer to as NDOL. This leads to simple analytical
expressions whose behavior can be examined in detail.
NDOL is to be distinguished from zero diﬀerential over-
lap (ZDO),36 which refers to overlap between orbitals on
diﬀerent atomic centers. In the NDOL approximation,
ρci = 0.73 Under special conditions, ZDO implies NDOL.
ci,A and Sci are zero.

quantities include some electrostatic contributions. This
quantity is also called a “bond hardness”.19

Thus, Eq. (38) is consistent with previous energy ex-
pressions obtained with Coulson charges34,36–38 and with
the 2-state model of Nalewajski33. In Coulson,36 Murrell
et. al,37 and McWeeny38 a fraction of ionic character is
deﬁned instead of a charge. That fraction is identical
to γ2/(1 + γ2) which is q in the NDOL approximation.
Clearly, at large R, Eq. (8) in combination with Eq. (26)
approaches Eq. (39), Eq. (39) becomes linear in q, and
Hii, Hcc, and Hci approach asymptotic values (in R)
analogous to MM’s Eq. (2.40).34 The linear behavior in
the asymptotic regime is consistent with the conclusions
of PPLB. Even more importantly, Eq. (39) is expressly
non-analytical (i.e., it cannot be expanded in a Taylor

8

(40)

(41)

(42)

series) about q = 0 and q = 1, whereas Eq. (8) in com-
bination with Eq. (26) is analytical at both points away
from the NDOL limit (δN ∗
= 0). Coulson’s Fig. 5.7
ci,A 6
is a graph of γ(q) vs. q, which clearly shows the non-
analytical behavior, although he did not comment on it.36
The non-analytical behavior of the energy as a function
of q is also seen in GC-DFT.2 Eq. (39) embodies the EVB
representation of that behavior. The non-analytical be-
havior results in a derivative discontinuity in the energy
as a function of charge at integer values of the charge.
Perhaps because orthogonality between resonance states
is assumed, Nalewajski does not comment on the behav-
ior of the derivative at integer charges.33 Cios lowski and
Stefanov do see their version of the NDOL limit as con-
nected with PPLB.19 Likewise, PPLB,2 Perdew,35 and
Cios lowski and Stefanov19 note that the derivative dis-
continuity disappears once the systems in the GC rep-
resentation begin to interact signiﬁcantly. Eq. (26) em-
bodies that behavior as well. Examples of these charge
dependences are illustrated below.

Starting from Eq. (39), we evaluate Hci at the optimum

where ǫ = 2 Hci/(Hii −
Hcc). The ground state corre-
sponds to the negative root of γ(q) in Eq. (38), since
as Hci →
0, q must also go to zero, assuming that
Hcc > 0. For convenience, we call the ground state
Hii −
value of Eq. (39) ENDOL

for the resonance energy is equivalent to the well-known

The dependence of ENDOL(q) on Hcc and Hii appears to
be diﬀerent from that implied by Eq. (28). In fact, by
setting E(qNDOL
) = ENDOL
in Eq. (28), the two expres-
0
gs
sions become identical.

gs

≈

qgs.

We can gain further insight from Eq. (42) by solving
for Hcc and Hii in terms of ENDOL
Egs, Exs, and
qopt ≈
In a typical diatomic, Exs corresponds to
the ﬁrst electronic state which dissociates to the ions A+
and B−. Because of the NDOL approximation, these
three pieces of information are suﬃcient to specify the
energy. To achieve the desired result, we ﬁrst use the
fact that H 2
ci can be derived from either eigenvalue to
Hcc. Next we solve for Hcc
ﬁnd that Hii = Exs + Egs −
from Eq. (40) assuming that we know qgs. The result is
that

To see that Eq. (45) has the desired properties, note that
ω(q, qgs) lies between 0 and 1 over the interval [0,1] in q,
it is 0 at q = qgs, and ∂ω(q, qgs)/∂q at q = qgs is also
0. These properties are illustrated in Fig. 2. Taking into
account our restriction to a 2-state model, if we apply
atom decomposition to the eigenenergies, we would ob-
tain the same form as Eq. (4), with ωA0 = 1
ω(q, qgs),
ωA+ = ω(q, qgs), and ωA− = 0. Importantly, the repre-
sentation is in terms of eigenenergies instead of energy
matrix elements. Furthermore, as qgs approaches 0, as
in the assumed dissociation limit for AB, ENDOL(q) be-
comes linear in q.

−

Another representation of the occupation number,
Eq. (46), is signiﬁcant. By using the relationship q =
γ2/(1 + γ2) from Eqs. (38), we obtain

(43)

(44)

Hcc = (1

qgs) Egs + qgs Exs

−

and

Hii = qgs Egs + (1

qgs) Exs .

−

In the NDOL approximation, the pure state energies are
simple linear combinations of the eigenenergies. Making
all of the necessary substitutions and rearrangements in
Eq. (42), we achieve the ensemble representation:
ENDOL(q) = Egs + ω(q, qgs) (Exs −

Egs) ,

(45)

where the occupation number is

ω(γ, γgs) =

(γ

γgs)2

−
(1 + γ2) (1 + γ2

gs)

.

(47)

As is necessary physically, the occupation number is 0
when γ = γgs, where γgs corresponds to qgs. The com-
plete generalization of Eq. (47) is equivalent to following
the process steps outlined above.

Eqs. (43) and (44) can be inverted.

Inversion gives

ENDOL(q) in terms of Hcc and Hii:

Consistent with the conclusions of MM and physical
necessity, the coeﬃcients are not positive-semideﬁnite.
Fig. 3 illustrates Eq. (49), the coeﬃcient for the covalent
state. In order to cover the range of energies between Egs
and Exs, the coeﬃcients of Hcc and Hii cannot possibly
be positive-semideﬁnite. The coeﬃcients are not deﬁned
for qgs = 1/2. At that value of the ground-state charge,
Hcc must equal Hii.

It is interesting to see how the present results connect
with classical electrostatic potentials (Eq. (3)). We can
expand Eq. (46) locally as a function of q as long as the
expansion point is not zero or one. First,

This quadratic expansion has the form of Eq. (3) and be-
haves well physically under dissociation, even to the ex-
tent of preserving the dissociation limit. The electroneg-
ativity, hardness, and electrostatic contributions are em-
bedded in the eigenenergies. The equivalent expansion of
Eq. (48) might be more revealing in displaying these con-
tributions. A key observation is that the quadratic term
0) and
vanishes completely at inﬁnite separation (qgs →
only the linear dependence survives. Again, the survival
of the linear charge dependence is consistent with PPLB.
There is no residual atomic hardness contribution as has
appeared in many implementations of Eq. (3).4–6,23,34 We
speculate that a hardness contribution might be missing
because we have considered only a 2-state model instead

of a 3-state model. Our reasoning behind this specula-
tion is discussed below. We have ruled out the possibil-
ity that introducing the NDOL approximation prior to
making the expansion is a factor. Nevertheless, adding
a third state must not change the fact that the coeﬃ-
cient of the quadratic term must go zero in order for the
results to be consistent with PPLB.2,19,33 Likewise, any
hardness contributions to the linear term must be scaled
by a coeﬃcient that goes to zero at large R. Clearly, one
cannot approximate either Eq. (26) or (39) quadratically
to arbritrary accuracy in a global sense.

B. General Deﬁnition of the Energy
for a Given Charge

Next we consider the densities and their energies in the

NDOL approximation. From Eq. (20) we have

ρNDOL(γ) = (ρcc + γ2 ρii)/(1 + γ2) ,

(55)

Thus, from Eq. (38),

ρNDOL(q) = ρcc + q (ρii −

ρcc) .

from
By symmetry in Eq. (55), ρ(γ) = ρ(

Eq. (8), E(γ)
γ). To address this diﬃculty,
= E(
MM appeal to a maximum entropy principle. We prefer
instead to appeal to CS-DFT.33,41,53 Accordingly, CS-
DFT instructs us to place the ΓNDOL(γ) into groups de-
ﬁned by the density that they produce. Since ΓNDOL(γ)
and ΓNDOL(
γ) both yield the same density, ρNDOL(q),
they are grouped together. The energy assigned to
ENDOL[ρNDOL(q)] is the minimum of the energies for
these two Γ’s:

ENDOL[ρNDOL(q)] = min

The ground state energy is then the minimum over all q
of ENDOL[ρNDOL(q)]. When diﬀerential overlap (ρci 6
= 0)
is included, the densities appear to become unique for γ’s
of diﬀerent signs.74

γ(q))

(57)

−

Note that a similar procedure could be followed for
MM’s 3-state case at the ZDO level that they assume.
See also Ref. 33. Even with this comparatively simple
extension, the situation is less clear than in the 2-state
case. Many densities may have the same charge on the
atoms. By again appealing to CS-DFT, one can assign
E(q) for a given q by minimizing over the energies of all
densities with the same q. That is, as a straightforward
extension of CS-DFT, we very generally deﬁne

E(q)

min
ρ(q,δ)→q

≡

ECS−DFT[ρ(q, δ)] ,

(58)

where δ represents all of the other undetermined parame-
ters of the density ρ(q, δ). By minimizing over δ, one may
introduce dependencies on the energy matrix elements
that are absent from the present 2-state model.33 This

10

is the reason behind our speculation that the isolated-
atom hardnesses do not appear in Eq. (54) because of the
limitations of the 2-state model. One advantage of the
charge-generalized CS-DFT approach over a maximum
entropy principle is that the true ground state proper-
ties can be preserved in the same way that the ground
state energy can be recovered — by minimizing over all
allowed densities in conventional CS-DFT.41

C. Examples: HF, LiH, and H2

First we discuss modeling the polar molecules HF and
LiH in the NDOL approximation. Then, for the non-
polar molecule H2, we compare the NDOL and general
cases. There we utilize the Weinbaum wavefunction.56,57
It provides an excellent illustration of the ambiguities en-
coountered in deﬁning the resonance state wavefunctions.
We also examine various approximations for δN ∗
ci,A and
examine the change in the charge dependence as a func-
tion of R.

K0)(qK2 /(1 + (qK2 + K K2

For HF and LiH, we use RKR curves75 to deﬁne Egs
and Exs. For the X1Σ+ and B1Σ+ states of HF, the RKR
data are from Di Lonardo and Douglas,76; for the X1Σ+
and A1Σ+ states of LiH, the RKR data are from Chan et
al.77 and Pardo et al.78 We use the calculations of Ref. 19
to deﬁne qgs. These data are shown in Figs. 4 and 5. The
B1Σ+ and A1Σ+ states dissociate to ions, H+ and F−
and Li+ and H−, respectively. To allow matching of the
diﬀerent spatial ranges of the data, analytical ﬁts for the
energy curves were made with the Rose and Rose+ionic
functional forms.79 The charge data were ﬁt with the
3 ))),
functional form, K0 + (K1 −
where the K’s are ﬁtting parameters. Hcc and Hii were
computed from Eqs. (43) and (44), respectively. In both
cases, Hcc and Hii cross at qgs = 1/2 and meet their
respective states at the dissociation limits. Representa-
tive shapes of the charge dependence for given values of
R are shown in Figs. 6 and 7. The correct dissociation-
limit behavior is observed in both cases. In simulations
where each atom remains within a unit charge interval,
the NDOL model might therefore prove to be useful, al-
though it is unlikely to be quantitative. The diﬀerence
in charge transfer characteristics between the present re-
sults and PPLB can be seen by contrasting the R = 3 ˚A
curve of Fig. 7 with the Rc = 3.1 ˚A curve of their Fig. 1.2
The transfer is more gradual here and passes through
fractional charge states, compared to PPLB which is
very sharp and passes directly from a completely covalent
state to a completely ionic one.

Next we consider H2. The simplest valence bond
form for the covalent state ψ(1)
= (φA(1)φB(2) +
φB(1)φA(2))/(2 + 2S2
AB)1/2, where SAB is the atomic
orbital overlap.80 Our na¨ive inclination for the ionic
state is to use the familiar ψ(1)
= (φA(1)φA(2) +
φB(1)φB(2))/(2 + 2S2
AB)1/2. The total wavefunction is
ψ = c(ψc + γψi). It turns out that the total densities for

problem is that the assumption about the Hirshfeld par-
titioning form is incorrect. This partitioning cannot lead
to a value of ρii,A that integrates to NA0
1 = 0. A dif-
ferent partitioning must be chosen to force all of the den-
sity in ρii to belong to atom B. In addition, we know the
optimum values of γ for these two resonance states56,57
and that these values correspond to q = 0. For instance,

−

at the equilibrium H2 separation, γopt =
0.26, with the
resonance energy deﬁned as positive.56 From Eq. (23),
we also can deduce that δN ∗
0.13. This
analysis hints at the subtle properties that the density
decomposition must possess if one implements explicit
decomposition of ρci.

ci,A = γopt/2 =

Another immediate insight is that any ﬁxed value of
γ applied within ψ leads to an acceptable covalent state.
Clearly, the energy change caused by a polarization of the
H2 charge density will diﬀer depending on one’s choice for
the resonance state. Similarly, the density decomposition
will show some sensitivity to this choice.

Of course, a more sensible choice for the ionic state
is ψ(2)
i = φB(1)φB(2) because, for a homonuclear di-
atomic, the charged states correspond to broken charge-
symmetry states. Even in this simple case, the partition-
ing of ρci may be nontrivial.

As a ﬁnal consideration, we illustrate the inﬂuence of
overlap on ionicity. For this purpose, we utilize our orig-
inal choices for covalent and ionic wavefunctions, ψ(1)
and ψ(1)
. The overlap integral is estimated in terms of
SAB as given above. Taking φ(r) =
α r),
a)(1 + a + 1/3 a2),
the atomic overlap is SAB(a) = exp(
p
where a = α R. The eﬀect of overlap is shown in Fig. 8
as γ(q)(1
q). There it can been seen that the NDOL
approximation becomes accurate beyond approximately
2 ˚A. The relatively large range of R for which the NDOL
approximation is accurate in this case is due in no small
part to the fact that Sci depends on the square of SAB.
This broad range of accuracy and the fact that Eqs. (45)
and (46) are well-behaved for any R makes it tempting to
use NDOL in general. However, near equilibrium bond
lengths, Fig. 8 indicates that overlap eﬀects should not
be ignored.

VI. CONCLUSION

In order to apply chemical potential equalization in
a simulation that involves conditions far from reference
states, the potential energy must be deﬁned for arbi-
trary values of the charges. To address this challenge,
we have derived a new charge-dependent pair potential
from a 2-state empirical valence bond model. The charge
is deﬁned from a decomposition of the density into con-
stituent contributions. The explicit charge dependence
is deduced by requiring consistency between the density
decomposition and the wavefunction descriptions of the
ground state. The energy expression can be made valid
for any range of charge of interest. The decomposition
theme is further extended to deﬁne the energy of indi-
vidual constituents, again by requiring consistency be-
tween the density decomposition and the wavefunction
descriptions. The energy of the system for a given value
of charge is made unique by appealing to constrained
search density functional theory. An examination of the
model shows linear dependence on charge at the disso-

ciation limit, as well as discontinuous behavior in the
derivative of the energy as a function of charge at inte-
ger values of the charge. This behavior is consistent with
the analysis of Perdew et al.2 and others.19,33 The po-
tential energy for arbitrary charge and separation of the
constituents can be represented as an ensemble average of
the eigenenergies with a nonlinear, analytical dependence
of the occupation number on charge. The representation
of the potential energy in terms of the pure-state energy
matrix elements is possible, but, by physical necessity,
cannot be expressed as an ensemble average with posi-
tive semideﬁnite coeﬃcients.

To determine a pair potential for all values of q and R
with this method, one needs ﬁve reference or calibration
curves. These most often will be computed values of the
ground-state energy, the charges along the ground-state
energy curve, the resonance state overlap integral, the co-
valent energy and ionic energy. Measurements of ground
and ionic-excited state energies and charges can also be
used. The covalent energy and ionic energy are deter-
mined for integer charges only. To determine a point on
the potential energy curve, a well-deﬁned ﬁve step proce-
dure is followed using the ﬁve input curves. An immedi-
ate application of the method could be to construct the
reference potential curves for the A2, B2, and AB sys-
tems. Simulations on arbitrary mixtures of these three
types of systems under nonequilibrium initial conditions
would then be possible. Chemical potential equalization
would be used to dynamically adjust the charges of the
constituents. More generally, we envision the present ap-
proach as forming the basis for a new class of charge-
dependent empirical potentials for use in large-scale sim-
ulations of reactive systems.

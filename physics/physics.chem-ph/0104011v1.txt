Abstract

A theoretical study of the resonance optical response of assemblies of ori-

ented short (as compared to an optical wavelength) linear Frenkel chains is

carried out. Despite the fact that the energy spectrum of a single chain is

composed of the bands of Frenkel exciton states, a two-level model is used

to describe the optical response of a single linear chain. We account for

only the (on-resonance) optical transition between the ground state and the

state of the one-exciton band bottom as having the dominating oscillator

strength as compared to the other states of the one-exciton manifold. The

(oﬀ-resonance) process of creation of two excitons per chain is neglected be-

cause it requires a higher excitation frequency due to the quasi-fermionic

nature of one-dimensional Frenkel excitons. A distribution of linear chains

over length resulting in ﬂuctuations of all exciton optical parameters, such as

the transition frequency and dipole moment as well as the radiative rate, are

1

taken explicitly into account.

We show that both transmittivity and reﬂectivity of the ﬁlm may behave

in a bistable fashion, originated from saturation of the nonlinear refraction

index, and analyze how the eﬀects found depend on the ﬁlm thickness and on

the inhomogeneous width of the exciton optical transition. Estimates of the

driving parameters show that ﬁlms of oriented J-aggregates of polymethine

dyes at low temperatures seem to be suitable species for the experimental

veriﬁcation of the behavior found.

I. INTRODUCTION

Since pioneering works of Jelley1 and Scheibe2, who discovered the phenomenon of linear

aggregation of polymethine dye molecules in solution with rising their volume concentration

and, as a result, drastic changes of their optical properties (the appearance of a red-shifted

narrow band, called now J-band), these species have been the subject of unremitting interest
of reseachers. In the beginning of the nineties, Wiersma and co-workers3–5 demonstrated the

possibility of further narrowing of the J-band as well as shortening of its emission lifetime

by an order of magnitude via cooling to the temperature of liquid helium. At present, it

is widely accepted that the unusual properties of such systems originate from the fact that

their optically active states are Frenkel exciton states (see for a comprehensive review Refs.

6 and 7).

In recent time, a considerable attention has been drawn to the problem of strong cou-

pling of organic polymers and molecular aggregates to resonant radiation. Room temper-

ature spectral narrowing of emission8,9 and cooperative emission10,11 in π-conjugated poly-

mer thin ﬁlms, superradiant lasing from the J-aggregated cyanine dye molecules adsorbed

onto colloidal silica and silver12,13 as well as the room temperature polariton emission from

strongly coupled organic semiconductor microcavities14 have been reported. All these eﬀects

unambiguously mean a collectivization of polymers and J-aggregates via the emission ﬁeld

and are of great importance from the viewpoint of laser applications (see Refs. 15–17 for

reviews). On the other hand, the conditions of such a strong coupling are those necessary

for manifestation of a bistable behavior of a collection of homogeneously broadened two-
level systems.18–23 Much eﬀorts have been undertaken to this problem with its projection to

J-aggregated assemblies. The conditions for the bistable optical response to observe from
an individual J-aggregate24–27 and even of a dimer24,28–30 have been analized. Bistability

discussed in Refs. 24–27,30 is attributed to an individual aggregate and consists of an abrupt

switching of the aggregate population from a low level to a higher one as the pump inten-

sity rises. Consequently, the reﬂectivity (transmittivity) of a macroscopic ensemble of such

3

species may be switched oﬀ (on) in a step-wise way, allowing thus creation of an all-optical

bistable element.

The eﬀect we are speaking about originates from the dynamical resonance frequency shift

dependent on the population of the system. However, as it has been shown in Refs. 25,27

and 30, an aggregate of a length smaller than the emission wavelength does not display any

bistable behavior. This ﬁnding makes the above mechanism of the aggregate bistability to

be hardly experimentally veriﬁed. Indeed, despite an aggregate may incorporate to itself

thousands of molecules and thus may have a length larger than the emission wavelength, in

reality, only a subsystem of segments, consisting of a portion of the aggregate (the so-called

coherently bound molecules), responds to the action of a resonant external ﬁeld.31 Because of

a disorder (of static and thermal nature) of the surroundings, the exciton coherence length,

being the physical length of an aggregate in the absence of disorder, is reduced to a size

N ∗ dependent on the degree of disorder. For the real conditions, the number N ∗ is usually

smaller than the emission wavelength counted in the lattice unit. At room temperature,

N ∗ is determined basically by dephasing (originated from thermal ﬂuctuations of molecular

positions) and has an order of magnitude of several lattice units.32,33 On decreasing the tem-

perature, disorder tends to be of static nature. It is determined by static ﬂuctuations of the

aggregate structure as well as the surroundings and becomes dominating as the temperature

approaches zero. The static disorder results in Anderson localization of the exciton within
an aggregate segment with the typical size of the order of several tens of lattice units.3–5,34,35

The number of molecules within the localization length plays now the role of N ∗ and, in fact,

represents a higher limit for the number of coherently bound molecules. Further increasing

N ∗ would be possible by means of reducing the degree of static disorder that is generally

out of control.

In this connection, in Refs. 36 the question was risen whether an ensemble of localized

exciton states may behave in a bistable fashion. It was used the fact that the exciton states,

located within the same localization domain and being active in the optical response, form a

local energy structure with a few levels (two or three) similar to the one existing on a regular

4

chain with length N

N ∗.37,38 In other words, an aggregated sample can be modelled by an

∼

ensemble of short (compared to the emission wavelength) linear Frenkel chains stochastically

distributed over their lengths N. It was shown that an ultrathin ﬁlm with a thickness much

smaller than the emission wavelength (which makes possible to use the mean-ﬁeld approach)

manifested bistability of the resonance optical response.

In this paper, we follow the conjecture proposed in Refs. 36 and generalize the results

reported there to ﬁlm thicknesses of the order of or larger than the emission wavelength, when

the mean-ﬁeld approach, being an adequate approximation for thinner ﬁlms, is no longer

valid. This paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we present the model and mathematical

formalism. Section III deals with an analysis of the feasibility of a bistable response from an

ultrathin ﬁlm (under the condition of validity of the mean ﬁeld approximation), taking into

account the ﬂuctuations of all exciton optical parameters, such as the one-exciton transition

frequency and dipole moment as well as the one-exciton exciton radiative rate.39 Further

(Sec. IV), we present results of numerical simulations for thin ﬁlms of thickness larger than

the emission wavelength and determine the ranges of driving parameters, for which the ﬁlm

reﬂectivity and transmittivity manifests bistability.

In Sec. V, we make estimates for J-

aggregates of PIC and show that critical parameters for the occurence of such a behavior

seems to be achievable for thin ﬁlms at low temperatures. Finally, Sec. VI concludes the

paper. Some preliminary results of the present study have been reported in our recent

paper.40

II. DESCRIPTION OF THE MODEL

An elementary object of an ensemble we will be dealing with represents a short (with

a length smaller than the emission wavelength) ordered linear chain consisting of N two-

level molecules (with N much larger than unity). Due to the strong intermolecular dipolar

coupling, the optically active states are the Frenkel exciton states rather than the states of

individual molecules. In the nearest-neighbour approximation, which we adopt hereinafter,

5

one-dimensional Frenkel excitons appear to be non-interacting fermions41 so that any state

with a ﬁxed number of excitons can be constructed as a Slater determinant of one-exciton

where ω21 is the transition frequency of an isolated molecule and U (chosen hereinafter to

be positive) is the magnitude of the nearest-neighbour hopping integral.

The optical transition from the ground state of the chain to the lowest state of the one

exciton band k = 1 has the dominating oscillator strength (81% of the total one; see, for

instance, Ref. 6). Furthermore, the transition betweeen the bottoms of one-exciton and two-

exciton bands is blue-shifted as compared to the ground-state-to-one-exciton band bottom

transition by an energy E2

E1 = 3π2U/N 2. The blue shift originates of the fermionic

−

nature of one-dimensional Frenkel excitons and was experimentally veriﬁed for the ﬁrst

time in Ref. 42. These two facts were put forward in Ref. 36 as a motivation to consider

the transition from the ground state to the bottom of the one-exciton band as an isolated

two-level transition. This assumption can indeed be approved provided that the actual Rabi

frequency of the external ﬁeld is smaller than the blue shift of one-to-two exciton transitions.

Further analysis of the transitions to higher exciton manifolds showed that they did not lead

to qualitative changes of the behavior found within the framework of the two-level model.43

Based on these ﬁndings and taking into account that the spatial inhomogeneity of the ﬁeld

and matter variables complicates the treatment drastically, we will use in what follows the

two-level approach to describe the matter response.

6

Thus, we model the ensemble of linear Frenkel chains as that comprised of inhomoge-

neously broadened (due to the ﬂuctuations of chain lengths) two-level systems, but with

the optical characteristics of the transition having all attributes of a one-exciton transition.

Note that neglecting the one-to-two-exciton optical transitions means that no more than

one exciton per chain is created by the external ﬁeld. Respectively, such a channel of eﬃ-

cient exciton quenching as the intra-chain exciton-exciton annihilation44 plays no role within

the framework of the two-level approximation. In principle, the excitonic annihilation can

involve two excitons created on diﬀerent chains. As follows, however, from the results pre-

sented in Ref. 44, the rate of such a process is negligible under the restrictions of our model:

low temperature and N

≫

We also assume that the transition dipole moments of all chains are parallel to each

other as well as to the ﬁlm plane.45 With regard to the input ﬁeld E i, the on-resonance and

normal incidence conditions are chosen. The input ﬁeld polarization can be set without loss

of generality to be directed along the transition dipole moment. Then, all quantities can be

considered as scalars.

Under the above limitations, the time evolution of the ﬁlm is described in terms of the

2 density matrix ραβ (α, β = 1, 2) standing for determination of the state of a chain of

length N. The density matrix equation together with the Maxwell equation for the total

ﬁeld

, including a secondary ﬁeld produced by the ﬁlm, form the closed system of equations

As was pointed out in Refs. 21,22,47–51, using the integral wave equation to study

the non-stationary nonlinear response from a dense absorber has an obvious advantage:

the boundary conditions are not required within this framework.

latter, in turn, is calculated from constituent equations (3a) - (3b) and (4). The background

refraction index is not included in Eq.(3c) because, in fact, this simply results in constant

renormalization.49

Rigorously speaking, for a dense system as that we are considering, the deviation of the

acting ﬁeld from the average (Maxwell) ﬁeld may be signiﬁcant. A simpleast way to account

for this diﬀerence is to add the (Lorentz-Lorenz) local-ﬁeld correction in the form (4π/3)

P
in the matter equations (3a)-(3b) (see, for instance, Ref. 21). Along

to the Maxwell ﬁeld

E

this paper, however, we will neglect the local ﬁeld correction justifying this approximation

by our previous study: for that arrangement of the incident fequency we are going to study

8

(see Sec. IV B), this correction leads only to small quantitative eﬀects.49

Assume that the incident ﬁeld has the form

Ei = Ei(t) cos(ωit

kix), where ωi and

ki = ωi/c are the frequency and wavenumber, respectively, and Ei(t) is the amplitude, slowly

varying in the scale of the optical period 2π/ωi. Thus, by passing to the rotating frame by

by t since the ﬁlm thickness of our interest is of the order of a few vacuum wavelengths,

λi = 2π/ki. Thus, the actual passage time of the light through the ﬁlm has the order of

magnitude of the optical period while all the characteristic times of the problem discussed

(Γ, ¯h/dEi, ∆−1) are much longer. One can, therefore, consider the ﬁeld as propagating

instantaneously inside the ﬁlm.

III. ULTRATHIN FILM, L < λ′

We turn ﬁrst to the case of an ultrathin ﬁlm (L < λ′ with λ′ being the wavelength inside

the ﬁlm) when the spatial dependence of R and Z can be neglected and the exponentials in

Eq. (7c) can be replaced by unity inside the ﬁlm. Then, equations for the ﬁelds are simpliﬁed

First of all, we are interested in the stationary states in which the system can be found.

This implies to look for steady-state solutions to Eqs. (7), i.e., letting ˙R = ˙Z = 0. Under

the simpliﬁcation (9), valid for an ultrathin ﬁlm, it is straightforward to arrive to a closed

equation for the transmission coeﬃcient

:

Whenever

is found, the reﬂection coeﬃcient

can be expressed through

as follows:

T

T

In absence of the chain length ﬂuctuations, Eq. (10) is of third order with respect to

(10)

2 and

transmittivity. It occurs at ψ > ψc = 8. Due to the relation (11), the system reﬂectivity

is expected to behave in the same manner. The chain length ﬂuctuations make in general

impossible to predict the order of the resulting (after carrying out the averaging procedure)

transcendent equation.

In Ref. 36, Eq. (10) was analyzed under the assumption that the main eﬀect of the

length ﬂuctuations originates in the distribution of detuning δ, while ﬂuctuations of the rest

of parameters (µ, γ, γ1) are of no importance. Replacing then the distribution over length,

p(N), by a distribution over detuning and taking the latter in the form of a Lorentzian

of width g, authors of Ref. 36 could evaluate integrals in Eq. (10) analytically and found

that the resulting equation gaves rise to a bistable behavior, even under the condition of

dominating inhomogeneous broadening (g > γ).

Here, we do not restrict ourselves to the above assumption and carry out calculations,

accounting for ﬂuctuations of all stochastic variables in Eq. (10). We present the results

for a particular case of the incident frequency tuned up to the center of the absorption

band (δ0 = 0). Figure 1 shows a ”phase” diagram of the system behavior in the space of

parameters (σ, ψ) calculated on the basis of Eq. (10). The parameters of Gaussian p(N)

were chosen as ¯N = 30 and a = 9. By the terms ”one solution” and ”three solutions” in

Fig. 1, we marked regions where Eq. (10) had single-valued and three-valued real solutions,

respectively. The solid curve, which separates these two regions, is nothing but the critical

value of ψ for bistability to occur versus the inhomogeneous width σ = 2π2Ua/¯h¯Γ ¯N 3. It

starts from ψc = 8 at σ = 0, in full correspondence with the earlier ﬁndings,18,19,36 and then

gradually goes up on increasing σ.

For comparison, we also depicted in Fig. 1 the curve (dashed) obtained under the ap-

proximations used in Ref. 36, i.e., assuming the detuning δ as being the unique stochastic

variable and setting µ = γ = 1, γ1 = const. As can be seen, there is almost no diﬀerence

between the solid and dashed curves. This means that indeed, ﬂuctuations of the detun-

ing basically determine the result of averaging in Eq. (10), thus approving this heuristic

assumption used in Ref. 36.

12

Figure 2 presents the typical examples of the input ﬁeld dependence of the reﬂection

and transmission coeﬃcients for an ultrathin ﬁlm (kiL = 0.1) which were obtained by the

numerical solution of Eqs. (7) at adiabatic scanning of the input ﬁeld amplitude ei up and

down. The results were obtained chosing the following set of parameters: ψ = 20, ¯N = 30,

a = 9, γ1 = 0.25N/ ¯N, γ = 0.875 + 0.125N/ ¯N. From this ﬁgure, one can conclude that,

when the inhomogeneous width σ is small, the system shows a stable hysteresis loop (optical

hysteresis) both in reﬂectivity and transmittivity, despite the fact that ﬂuctuations of all

parameters are taken into account (note that the hysteresis of transmittivity in Ref. 36 was

calculated only for the particular case of absence of the chain length ﬂuctuations). However,

as σ grows, the hysteresis cycle disappears and only a one-valued monotonic response exists.

In order to gain insight into the time required for the output signal to approach its

stationary value, we have numerically solved Eqs. (7) at a ﬁxed amplitude of the input ﬁeld,

ei, and its further step-wise switching to another value. Figure 3 shows an example of such

calculations for the same set of parameters as in Fig. 2, setting σ = 0.25. We start with

a non-saturating incident ﬁeld amplitude ei = 3, for which the reﬂection (transmission)

coeﬃcient is high (low), and wait for a stationary value of the latter. At some instant of

time (in particular, at τ = ¯Γt = 50), we switch step-wisely the incident ﬁeld to a saturating

value ei = 6, for which the reﬂection (transmission) coeﬃcient is low (high), and wait again

for a stationary value of the latter. The results of these calculation are depicted in Fig. 3

with solid lines. With dotted lines, we present the results of analogous calculations obtained

only by switching back the incident ﬁeld amplitude from a higher (ei = 6) to a lower (ei = 3)

value.

From these data, it can be claimed ﬁrst that the transient time depends on whether the

incident ﬁeld amplitude is switched up or down. Second, the transient time is of the order of

a few units of the population relaxation time ¯Γ−1

1 . Indeed, in units of ¯Γ−1 this time interval

is of the order of 10. Taking into account that ¯Γ1/¯Γ = 0.25 in this particular calculation,

one arrives at the above stated conclusion.

IV. THICK FILM, L > λ′

A. Motivation

In our previous studies of nonlinear resonant reﬂection from an extended (L > λ′) dense
system of homogeneously broadened two-level molecules,48–50 we found that the reﬂectivity

of such a system could show diﬀerent regimes (bistability and self-oscillations48,49 as well as

chaos50) basically governed by the parameter Ψ, instead of ψ = ΨkL for an ultrathin ﬁlm

(see also Refs. 52,53). The physical meaning of Ψ is nothing but the halfwidth (in units of the

homogeneous width ¯Γ) of a gap in the spectrum of ﬁeld + molecules collective excitations -

polaritons (polariton splitting; see for more details the monograph by Davydov 54). This gap

appears in the vicinity of the molecule-ﬁeld resonance and requires the condition Ψ

1 to

≫

be fulﬁlled. The linear dielectric constant for frequencies ranging within the gap is negative

(the refractive index is imaginary), implying total reﬂection of the light of such frequencies.54

The physical origin of the eﬀects reported in Refs. 48–50,53 is attributed to saturation

of the refraction index by the ﬁeld acting within the polariton band gap. Let us recall

brieﬂy the motivation rised in those papers. For an input ﬁeld varying slowly in the scale

of the relaxation times Γ−1, Γ−1
1

(the case of our interest in the present study), the medium

adiabatically follows the ﬁeld ( ˙R can be set to zero). Under such conditions, Eqs. (7a)

and (7c) are equivalent to only one equation:48,49

seen from Eq. (13), the linear dielectric function ε has a dominating negative real part within

a rather wide interval of changing the detuning, in fact, from a few negative units to

2Ψ.

A weak ﬁeld acting within this band will be totally reﬂected from the system boundary.

At higher amplitudes of the ﬁeld, γ

Ψ, the dielectric function is saturated by the

acting ﬁeld, i.e., goes to unity, producing conditions for penetration of the ﬁeld into the

medium. The higher the ﬁeld amplitudes, the deeper the ﬁeld penetrates into the medium.

Now, reﬂection occurs from a very narrow (due to a high magnitude of Ψ) interface between

the saturated and non-saturated regions.52 This interface plays the role of an ”artiﬁcial”

mirror giving rise to a feedback necessary for the eﬀects outlined above to build up.

It turned out that namely in the limit of larger Ψ, i.e., in the presence of the polariton

band gap, the system shows the above mentioned peculiarities of nonlinear optical response

that are absent in the opposite case Ψ

1. When inhomogeneous broadening dominates

≤

(the main range of our interest), one should compare the inhomogeneous width 2σ with the

width of the gap 2Ψ. A simple analysis of Eq. (12b) reveals the clear result that a well-

pronounced gap (where the dielectric function has a dominating negative real part) develops

at Ψ

σ. An inhomogeneous broadening of the order of, or higher than 2Ψ destroys

≫

the gap and, as a consequence, all the nonlinear eﬀects accompanying the presence of this

gap. Below, we show details of the inﬂuence of inhomogeneous broadening on the nonlinear

optical response of the ﬁlm.

B. Numerical simulations and discussions

All nonlinear features accompanying the presence of the polariton gap were found to be
Ψ.48–50,53

stronger when the input ﬁeld frequency lies in the middle of the gap, i.e., at δ =

Therefore, when studying the nonlinear reﬂection from and transmission through a ﬁlm

consisting of inhomogeneously broadened two-level systems, we will also set δ =

Ψ and

−

−

15

consider Ψ > Ψc = 4.66 (Ψc is the threshold for bistability in reﬂection48) to get the optimal

conditions for the eﬀects we are looking for. It is worth noting that, as was found in Ref. 49,

the local-ﬁeld correction at δ =

Ψ has a relatively small quantitative eﬀect. In particular,

−

the threshold value Ψc changes from 4.66 to 5.45 if the local-ﬁeld correction is taken into

account.

Figure 4 presents examples of the input ﬁeld dependence of the reﬂection and trans-

mission coeﬃcients for a thin ﬁlm of thickness L = λi depending on the inhomogeneous

width σ = (2π2a/ ¯N 3)

(U/¯h¯Γ), where ¯N and a were ﬁxed ( ¯N = 30, a = 9) and U/¯h¯Γ

·

was varied. The other parameters were chosen as follows: Ψ =

δ = 6, γ1 = 0.25N/ ¯N,

−

γ = 0.875 + 0.125N/ ¯N. The data were obtained at adiabatic scanning of the input ﬁeld

amplitude ei up and down. From this ﬁgure, one can conclude, ﬁrst, that the system shows

a stable hysteresis loop both in reﬂectivity and in transmittivity or, in other words, be-

haves in a bistable fashion until σ < Ψ, i.e., until the inhomogeneous width approaches

the polariton splitting, in full correspondence with what we mentioned above. The second

observation, evident from Fig. 4, is that the switching amplitudes of the input ﬁeld do not

depend strongly on the inhomogeneous width (at a ﬁxed magnitude of Ψ).

In Fig. 5, we depicted spatial proﬁles of the amplitude module of the ﬁeld inside the

ﬁlm versus the input ﬁeld amplitude ei. The calculations were performed for the same set of

parameters and conditions as those presented in Fig. 4, only setting σ = 2. Plots (a) and (b)

correspond to adiabatic scanning of ei up and down, respectively. The darkness of a local

diﬀerential domain is proportional to the ﬁeld amplitude module. Observing these plots, we

can claim the following. Despite the fact that the thickness of the system does not exceed

one wavelength in vacuum, λi, the ﬁeld inside the ﬁlm is not uniform at any amplitude of

the input ﬁeld. For not-saturating magnitudes of ei, this is simply explained by the fact

that the (linear) refraction index in this case (at δ =

Ψ) n

1, that, in turn, gives rise

−

≈ −

to decreasing the ﬁeld amplitude on a scale short compared to λi. At higher magnitudes of

the input ﬁeld, ranging within the bistable interval (see Fig. 4), the spatial inhomogeneity of

the ﬁeld demonstrates a global character, originating in the interplay between the forward

16

and backward (in the present case, reﬂected from the back boundary of the ﬁlm) waves.

Comparison of the ﬁeld proﬁles depicted in the plots (a) and (b) at a ﬁxed magnitude of

the input ﬁeld reveals that they diﬀer one from the other. In other words, one may make a

statement about the existence of spatial hysteresis of the ﬁeld inside the ﬁlm.

Figure 6 sheds light on the transient time of approaching the reﬂectivity (a) and trans-

mittivity (b) their stationary values when switching the incident ﬁeld amplitude up (solid

lines) and down (dotted lines), similar to that presented in Fig. 3. The calculations were

done for the following parameters: Ψ =

δ = 6, ¯N = 30, a = 9, σ = 2, γ1 = 0.25N/ ¯N,

−

γ = 0.875 + 0.125N/ ¯N As in the case of an ultrathin ﬁlm, the transient time has the order

of several units of the population relaxation time ¯Γ−1
1 .

In Fig. 7 we present the data of similar calculations as depicted in Fig. 4 performed

for thicker ﬁlms: L = 3λi and L = 5λi. As follows from these results, the hysteresis in

reﬂection remains to be very pronounced. However, it tends to disappear in transmittivity.

It is simply due to the fact that in order to make transparent a ﬁlm of higher thickness, one

needs to apply an input ﬁeld of very high amplitude, for which the system already does not

manifest at all bistability in transmission. By contrast, with regards to reﬂection, the ﬁlm

behaves as a ”semi-inﬁnite” medium, for which bistability in reﬂection may occur provided

the parameter Ψ exceeds its critical value Ψc = 4.66.48. In Fig. 8, we depicted the spatial

proﬁle of the ﬁeld inside the ﬁlm with thickness L = 3λi for the conditions for bistability to

occur. It is clear from these pictures that the ﬁeld is absolutely attenuated within a depth

a bit longer than λi and, hence, the transmittivity in this case is negligible.

As follows from our previos study48–50 of the nonlinear reﬂection from a collection of dense

homogeneosly broadened two-level atoms, the system may show instabilities of diﬀerent types

(self-oscillation and chaos) at higher values of the polariton splitting Ψ. Figure 9 presents

an example of such a behavior of the ﬁlm reﬂectivity (self-oscillation) for Ψ = 10 and the

inhomogeneous broadening σ = 2. The attempt to get a hysteresis loop of the reﬂection

coeﬃcient reveals that the lower branch is unstable (see Fig. 9a). The calculation done at

a ﬁxed amplitude of the input ﬁeld (ei = 8.5, above the switching threshold) shows that

17

indeed, the system has a regime of self-oscillations with a frequency of the order of ¯Γ/2.

V. ESTIMATES OF PARAMETERS

First, let us discuss the applicability of the two-level model used in this Paper. One

should compare the typical energy spacing between the ﬁrst and second exciton levels (E2

−
3π2(U/¯h¯Γ)/ ¯N 2 with the switching magnitude of the input ﬁeld ei. For the

E1)/¯h¯Γ

≃

parameters at hand, the former quantity ranges within the interval [3.3, 33] while the latter

is approximately equal to 3. Therefore, we can conclude that our approach is correct and

there is no necessity to include the one-to-two exciton transitions.

It is worthwhile to analyze the parameters of real systems in order to get insight into

feasibility of the bistable mechanism we are dealing with. In this sense, the J-aggregates of

PIC, as one of the most studied species of the type we need, seem to be suitable objects.

The width of the red J-band of PIC-Br (centered at λ = 576.1 nm), at low temperature,

has an inhomogeneous nature and an order of magnitude of 30cm−1 (or 1ps−1 in frequency
units)3–5. The blue shift of the transition from one-to-two exciton bands with respect to that

from the ground state to the one-exciton band for the red J-band has the same order. The

polariton splitting is ΨΓ = 2π ¯d2n0/¯h = (3/16π2)γ0 ¯N n0λ3, so that taking γ0 = (1/3.7)ns−1

and ¯N n0 = 1018cm−3 (an achievable concentration of molecules before aggregation), we

obtain ΨΓ

1ps−1, i.e., a value that exceeds twice the halfwidth of the J-band 0.5ps−1 (σΓ

≃

in our notation). Hence, for the parameters used, we are under the conditions needed for

bistability to occur.

VI. CONCLUSIONS AND REMARKS

In this Paper, we have numerically studied the optical bistable response of a thin ﬁlm

with thickness of the order of and larger than the emission wavelength, comprised of oriented

linear Frenkel chains. We have taken into account a distribution of chains over length,

18

resulting in an inhomogeneous broadening of the exciton optical transition as well as in the

distribution of the transition dipole moment.

From our study, the following conclusions can be drawn:

(i) Within a certain range of driving parameters (resonance detuning, polariton splitting,

and inhomogeneous width), the ﬁlms of thickness of the order of the vacuum emission wave-

length really show a bistable behavior with respect to both the reﬂection and transmission

of the resonant light;

(ii) The bistability eﬀect exists until the inhomogeneous width of the transition ap-

proaches the polariton splitting, i.e., for a fairly wide range of widths;

(iii) With increasing the ﬁlm thichness, the bistability in the transmitted signal tends to

disappear while it remains in the reﬂected signal;

(iv) At higher magnitude of the linear refraction index, the ﬁlm reﬂectivity shows insta-

bilities wich are of self-oscillating type;

(v) The parameters needed for the bistable behavior seem to be achievable for a thin ﬁlm

of J-aggregates of polymethine dyes and for some classes of conjugated polymers deposited

onto a dielectric substrate such as poly(p-phenylene-vinylene) derivatives.

The inhomogeneous broadening acts as a destructive factor. Reducing any source of

inhomogeneity is thus of great importance. In this sense, thin ﬁlms comprised of thiophene

oligomers seem to be very attractive objects, too, due to the possibility of precise controlling
the sizes of this type of molecules.55–58

To conclude, it is to be noting that the authors of Ref. 59 reported a room-temperature

formation of polariton states in ordered cyanine dye ﬁlms. The latter thus can also be

considered as a promising object from the viewpoint of our ﬁndings.

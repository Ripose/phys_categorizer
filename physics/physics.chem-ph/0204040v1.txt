REALISTIC INTERATOMIC POTENTIAL FOR MD
SIMULATIONS

YU.V.EREMEICHENKOVA, L.S.METLOV, A.F.MOROZOV

Abstract. The coeﬃcients of interatomic potential of simple form Exp-6 for
neon are obtained. Repulsive part is calculated ab-initio in the Hartree-Fock
approximation using the basis of atomic orbitals orthogonalized exactly on
diﬀerent lattice sites. Attractive part is determined empirically using single
ﬁtting parameter. The potential obtained describes well the equation of state
and elastic moduli of neon crystal in wide range of interatomic distances and
it is appropriate for molecular dynamic simulations of high temperature prop-
erties and phenomena in crystals and liquids.

1. Introduction

Investigation of strongly anharmonic nonlinear atomic systems by molecular dy-
namics (MD) method at high temperatures, pressures, or study of systems eﬀected
by large amplitude excitations requires high accuracy of interatomic potential (IP).
Series expansion of the IP in the displacements of atoms from equilibrium posi-
tions is widely used both in phonon theory and in MD simulation [11, 6]. Usually,
fourth-order anharmonisms or lower-order ones can be taken into account because
of complexity of expansion coeﬃcients calculation. As an alternative, realistic po-
tential method is used [17, 22, 21], in which exact equations of motion of atoms
are solved using IP of concrete substance without series expansion. Owing to that,
all-order anharmonisms are taken into account automatically. This advantage of
realistic potential method is especially useful in the MD simulation of soliton solu-
tions where atoms approach each other closely. Realistic IP should have simplest
form to reduce calculation expenses as well as it must describe precisely the proper-
ties of the substance under extreme conditions. The aim of this paper is to obtain
such IP.

Conventional way of realistic IP determination is empirical ﬁtting to the prop-
erties of gas or a crystal near the equilibrium point [7, 9]. However, such poten-
tials become unreliable at small interatomic distances like to that arising in soliton
waves. The properties of highly compressed matter (e.g., for neon up to 1 Mbar
[13]) could give an information for obtaining all-distance reliable IP. However, the
set of properties, which can be measured accurately at megabar pressures is re-
stricted strongly. Practically, the equation of state and bulk modulus only may
be included in this set [13, 2]. For Cik modules the precision worsens drastically
even at kilobar pressures [19, 23]. There is insuﬃciency of empirical information
for ﬁtting all the parameters of IP, and ab-initio calculation is required.

Realistic IP via interatomic distance is obtained in present work for the crys-
tal and dimer of neon. Repulsive part of the potential is calculated ab-initio in

Hartree-Fock approximation using the basis of localized atomic orbitals orthogo-
nalized exactly on diﬀerent lattice sites. Attractive part is chosen to have standard
Van-der-Vaals form of Cr−6 with single empirical parameter C. Used approxima-
tions and calculation details are described in the section 2. In the section 3 repulsive
part of IP is interpolated by exponential function of interatomic distance (Exp-6
potential) and the IP parameter are determined. Experimental veriﬁcation of the
IP obtained is performed in the section 4 using the data concerning equation of
state [13, 2] and elastic moduli [4, 5, 3, 14, 25, 12] of compressed neon. The IP
calculated is found to be in a good consistence with the experiment in whole range
of pressure.

2. Ab-initio calculation of repulsion potential

In MD simulations by realistic potential method the problem is divided into two
stages. The former is quantum-mechanical calculation of the IP at electron level,
with interatomic distance considering as a parameter. The latter is solving equa-
tions of motion of atoms using the IP obtained. This division is correspondent to
adiabatic approximation when atoms and electrons motion is described separately
[8].

Since pair collisions of atoms have maximal probability, we concentrate the at-
tention on the dimer of neon, and deﬁne the IP as a cohesive energy of the dimer.
Three-atom forces can be taken into account as a correction to the two-atom ones
using incremental expansion [20]. The estimation of [20] shows three-atom force
contribution to be small.

In Hartree-Fock approximation short-range repulsive part of IP is expressed
through one-electron density matrix. We don’t use hard core approximation. Re-
arrangement of all electron shells is allowed as interatomic distance is altered.

Localized basis of atomic orbitalls orthogonalized exactly (by Lovdin procedure
[15]) on diﬀerent lattice sites is used. In this basis one-electron density matrix has
the form [1]

We expand repulsive part of IP in the terms of small parameter such as the
largest overlap integral S. Usually, S << 1 in uncompressed crystal, and over-
lap integrals grow exponentially as interatomic distance is decreased. The IP is
expressed through the products of elements of orthogonalizing matrix P and two-
center Slater-Koster integrals. These integrals are atomic obital matrix elements of
crystal hamiltoinial operators. The order in S for two-center integrals is estimated

Using the estimations described above, we expand the repulsive part of IP in

Here E(0) is the energy of interatomis interaction if orthogonalizing of neighbor
atoms orbitals is neglected, W2, W4, W6 are orthogonalizing corrections. Series
expansion in S begins for them from the second, the third, and the sixth powers
respectively. Due to the presence of matrix P, orthogonalizing corrections contain
high-order terms in S along with the main ones.

should be checked for each substance under consideration.

Using the method described, we calculate repulsive part of IP, Vsr (equation
2.4), for neon dimer as a function of interatomic distance d. Atomic orbitals from
Clementi-Roetti set [10] are used as a basis. Hartree system of atomic units ~ =
e = me = 1 is applied. The calculation shows the terms E(0) and W2 in equation
2.4 to have the same order of magnitude and opposite signs. These terms are found
to give major contributions to the IP. The W4 correction consists of 0,02 per cent
of the IP at equilibrium interatomic distance d0. Further, the W4 does not exceed
of 1 per cent of the IP up to d ∼ 0.75d0. Finally, at small d, like to that arising in
soliton waves (for d above 0,6-0.75 d0), the W4 becomes about 2-4 per cent of the
IP. The contribution of W6 to the IP is small negligibly (0.002 per cent) in whole
range of d under consideration.

3. Determination of interatomic potential parameters

We interpolate calculated points Vsr(d) by exponential function of interatonic

distance using least square method by the formula

(3.1)

Vsr(d) = A0 exp(−α(x − 1));
x = d/z0

with two unknown parameters A0 and α. Experimental equilibrium interatomic
distance for neon dimer z0 = 5, 8411 a.u.
[18] is used as the third parameter
of the IP. The parameters are found to be A0 = (1, 1384 ± 0, 0002) · 10−4 a.u.,
α = 13, 6407 ± 0, 0037. Interpolation error is 4-1 per cent of Vsr when the d is
altered from equilibrium one to 0.6z0.

REALISTIC INTERATOMIC POTENTIAL FOR MD SIMULATIONS

Adding the attractive part, we express the IP in standard Exp-6 form

(3.2)

V (d) = A0 exp(−α(x − 1)) − Cd−6;
x = d/z0.

A single unknown parameter C remains in attractive part of IP. We propose to ﬁt
the C to experimental equilibrium interatomic distance. Using of equilibrium data is
considered to be reliable at all interatomic distances since the attraction is essential
near the equilibrium only while ab-initio calculated repulsive part dominates at
small d.

For MD simulation of lattice dynamics, it is possible to ﬁt the C to experimen-
tal data for dimer at T =0 K because the temperature eﬀects will be taken into
account explicitly, at the stage of equations of motion solving.
In this case, for
neon C=10,7293 (experimental equilibrium interatomis distance in the dimer is
z0=5,8411 a.u. [18]). Calculated cohesive energy of dimer is Ecoh = −1, 4497 · 10−4
a.u., experimental one is Ecoh = −1, 338 · 10−4 a.u. [18]. The discrepancy is 7 per
cent of experimental value.

For calculating static properties of a crystal at ﬁnite temperature, e.g., equation
of state, elastic modules, it is better to ﬁt the C to experimental data for a crystal
at the same temperature. Such determination allows one to take into account
implicitly three-atom forces, temperature eﬀects, zero-point oscillations, and other
eﬀects omitted at the stage of IP calculating.
In this case, for neon C=7,4030
(experimental equilibrium interatomis distance in the crystal is d0=5,9647 a.u. at
T = 4, 25 K [4]). Calculated cohesive energy of uncompressed crystal is Ecoh =
−6, 7620 · 10−4 a.u. per atom, experimental one is Ecoh = −(7, 35 ± 0, 03) · 10−4
a.u. [16]. The discrepancy is 7.6 per cent of experimental value.

4. Results and discussion

Interatomic potential of neon is given in the ﬁgure 1 as a function of inter-
atomic distance d. The IP calculated by equation 3.2 for dimer is plotted by solid
curve. Van-der-Vaals constant (C=10,7293) is ﬁtted to experimental equilibrium
interatomic distance in dimer [18].

”Experimental” IP obtained in [13] is denoted by solid circles. This IP had been
determined by interpolating experimental data p(V ) (measured at 300 K) by the
formula Exp-6. The interpolation had been performed in theoretical model taking
thermal pressure and zero-point oscillations into account explicitly, excluding them
from the deﬁnition of IP. It allows us to compare the 300 K data of [13] with our zero-
temperature result. Three-atom forces didn’t include explicitly in the model of [13].
However, in [13], the eﬀect of these forces is taken into account implicitly through
ﬁtting the IP to experimental data for a crystal.
In our calculation three-atom
forces are omitted because of ﬁtting to dimer data. The agreement of calculated
IP and experimental one indicates that three-atom forces in neon are small at the
pressures up to 1Mbar.

Two remaining curves in the ﬁgure 1 are interatomic potentials of neon obtained

by ﬁtting to experimental data using Lennard-Jones potential (6-12 formula)

V (x) = ε(−2/x6 + 1/x12)
x = d/z0,

where ε and z0 are ﬁtting parameters. Dashed curve is the IP obtained using
corresponding-states law ﬁtted to vapor-pressure ratio of isotopic liquid [7]. Dashed-
dotted curve is the IP ﬁtted to experimental lattice constant and cohesive energy of
crystal neon at p = 0, T = 0 K [9]. Fitting to equilibrium crystal properties leads to
bad describing the IP for compressed crystal. Fitting to compressed gas properties
gives the values of the IP close to experimental ones at moderated pressures.

Using the IP obtained (eq. 3.2) we calculate the equation of state p(V ) for solid
neon. Calculated pressure p against fractional volume is given in the ﬁgure 2 as solid
curve. Van-der-Vaals constant is ﬁtted to experimental equilibrium interatomic
distance d0=5,9647 a.u. measured for crystal neon at T =4.25 K, p=0 [4].

Experimental points p(V ) from [13] (T =300 K) and [2] (T =4.2 K) are also given
in the ﬁgure 2. At the pressures below 20 kbar theoretical curve is in a good
agreement with the experimental points of [2]. At moderated pressures theoretical
curve deviates from experimental points of [13] by 4 per cent. This deviation
caused, mainly, by neglecting of thermal pressure in our calculation. Figure 2
shows temperature sensitivity of the equation of state to be small.

We calculate bulk modulus of solid neon by means of the IP obtained. Van-
der-Vaals constant is ﬁtted to experimental equilibrium interatomic distance in the
crystal [4]. Calculated bulk modulus B via the pressure p is given in the ﬁgure
3 as solid curve. Experimental points obtained in [2] at T =4.2 K are plotted as
solid symbols. Bulk modulus is seen to be more sensitive to the approximations
used. Growing when the p is enhanced, the diﬀerence between calculated B and
measured one becomes about 7 per cent of experimental B at p=20 kbar. Incorrect
taking three-atom forces into account at moderated pressures is seems to contribute
mainly in this discrepancy. In our calculation three-atom forces (and zero-point
oscillations too) are taken into account implicitly, by ﬁtting the IP to experimental
data for uncompressed crystal. Thus, calculated B agrees with experimental one
at small pressures only (to 8 kbar). One can’t determine correctly the dynamics
of alteration of three-atom forces with enhancing of pressure.
It is the cause of
growing the deviation of calculated B from measured one.

We calculate elastic modules Cik using the IP obtained with Van-der-Waals
constant ﬁtted to crystal experimental data [4]. Calculated modules and exper-
imental ones are given in table 1 for uncompressed solid neon at low tempera-
tures. Isothermic modules had been obtained in static measurements [2, 4]. Adia-
batic modules had been measured in ultrasonic and neutron scattering experiments
[5, 3, 14, 25, 12]. However, the diﬀerence between isotermic modules and adiabatic
ones is negligible at the temperatures under consideration (see, e.g., [5]).

The Cik modules are seen to be more sensitive to the measurement method and
calculation approximations. The diﬀerence between theoretical and experimental
values of C11 and C44 is about 10 per cent of experimental values for most accurate
experiment [25]. The agreement is better for C12 modulus (the discrepancy is
about 2 per cent [25]). The deviation from Cauchy relation δ = (C44 − C12)/C12 is
also given in table 1. Cauchy violation is the measure of deviation of the IP from
spherical symmetry. The δ = 0, 11 ± 0, 03 in [20], while it falls into experimental
error bar in other experiments listed in the table 1. Cauchy relation takes place for
our calculation results because spherical symmetry form of the IP is supposed in
theoretical model. Small value of experimental d indicates that spherical symmetry
approximation for IP is valid for uncompressed neon at least. For another rare
gas crystal, krypton, experiment [23] shows Cauchy relation to satisfy well under

drop with enhancing pressure up to 200 kbar [24].

Unlike to Cik modules, bulk modulus B is less sensitive to measurement method
and calculation approximations. The discrepancy of theoretical result and experi-
mental one doesn’t exceed of 4 per cent and falls into experimental error frames.

5. Conclusion

Coeﬃcients of realistic IP of simple form Exp-6 are obtained for neon by ab-
initio calculation of repulsive part in Hartree-Fock approximation in the basis of
atomic orbitals orthogonalized exactly on diﬀerent lattice sites. Attractive part is
determined empirically using single ﬁtting parameter, Van-der-Vaals constant C.
For ﬁtting the C it is enough to know experimental equilibrium interatomic distance
in crystal (or dimer), i.e. high pressure experimental data is not required. The IP
calculated is suitable for molecular dynamic simulations of high temperature and
high pressure properties and phenomena in crystals and liquids due to simplicity
of the form and precise describing experimental data in wide range of interatomic
distances.

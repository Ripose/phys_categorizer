Abstract

Low-energy electron impact excitations of N2 molecules are studied using the ﬁxed-bond R-matrix

method based on state-averaged complete active space SCF orbitals. Thirteen target electronic states of

N2 are included in the model within a valence conﬁguration interaction representations of the target states.
Integrated as well as diﬀerential cross sections of the A3Σ+
u , a1Πg, w1∆u and
C3Πu states are calculated and compared with the previous experimental measurements. These excitations,

u , B3Πg, W 3∆u, B′3Σ−

u , a′1Σ−

especially of the higher four states, have not been studied enough theoretically in the previous literature.

In general, good agreements are observed both in the integrated and diﬀerential cross sections. However,

some discrepancies are seen in the integrated cross sections of the A3Σ+

u and C3Πu states, especially around

a peak structure.

INTRODUCTION

Electron impact excitation of nitrogen molecules plays an important role in atmospheric emis-

sion of planets and satellites such as the Earth, Titan and Triton. For example, excitation of the
a1Πg state and subsequent transitions to the ground X1Σ+

g state are responsible for the far ultravio-
let emissions of the Lyman-Birge-Hopﬁeld system which is prominent in the airglow of the Earth’s
atmosphere[1]. Recently, Khakoo et al.[2] measured diﬀerential cross sections (DCSs) of electron
impact excitation of N2 molecule from the ground X1Σ+
states of A3Σ+

g state to the 8 lowest excited electronic
u , a1Πg, w1∆u and C3Πu states. Based on their diﬀeren-
tial cross section data, Johnson et al.[3] derived integral cross sections (ICSs) for these electron

u , B3Πg, W 3∆u, B′3Σ−

u , a′1Σ−

impact excitations. In general, their ICSs are smaller than the other experimental cross sections at

low impact energies below 30 eV. These deviations may have some signiﬁcance on study of atmo-

spheric emissions, because a mean kinetic energy of electron at high altitudes is about 10 eV[4].

To shed light on this situation from a theoretical point of view, we perform the ab initio R-matrix

calculations of electron impact excitations of N2 molecule in this work.

Many previous experimental measurements have been focused on excitation to a speciﬁc elec-

tronic state. For example, Ajello and Shemansky[5] and Mason and Newell[6] measured ICSs for
electron impact excitation to the a1Πg state, whereas Poparic et al.[7], Zubek[8] and Zubek and
King[9] measured cross sections for the C3Πu state. In addition to these works, Zetner and Trajmar
[10] reported excitation cross sections to the A3Σ+
u , B3Πg, W 3∆u and a1Πg states. So far, compre-
hensive measurements of the excitation to the 8 lowest electronic states are limited to three groups

of Cartwright et al. [11], Brunger and Teubner [12] and Khakoo et al.[2]. The measurements of
Brunger and Teubner [12] include excitation DCSs for the E3Σ+

g states in addition to
the 8 lowest excited states. The DCSs of Brunger and Teubner[12] and Khakoo et al.[2] were later

g and a′′1Σ+

converted to ICSs by Campbell et al.[13] and Johnson et al.[3], respectively. Detailed reviews on

electron N2 collisions can be found in Itikawa[14] and Brunger and Buckman[15].

Several groups have performed theoretical calculation of low energy electron collisions with

N2 molecule. For example, Chung and Lin[16] employed the Born approximation to calculate
excitation cross sections for the 11 target states including the A3Σ+
u , B3Πg, W 3∆u, a1Πg, w1∆u and
C3Πu states. Later, the same group of Holley et al.[17] calculated excitation ICSs for the a1Πg state

using a two-state-close-coupling method. Fliﬂet et al.[18] and Mu-Tao and McKoy[19] reported
g , b′1Σ+
distorted-wave cross sections for excitation of the A3Σ+

u , B3Πg, W 3∆u, w1∆u, C3Πu, E3Σ+

u

2

and c′1Σ+

u states. In general, these approximate methods are expected to be accurate at high impact
energies above 30 eV. However, more elaborate method is required for precise comparison with
experiment at low energies. Gillan et al.[20] calculated excitation ICSs for the A3Σ+
u , B3Πg and
W 3∆u states using the ﬁxed nuclei R-matrix method. They included the 4 lowest target states in

their R-matrix model, with target CI wave functions containing 2-13 CSFs. Their cross sections
for the A3Σ+
u and W 3∆u states agree well with the experimental results of Cartwright et al. [11].
However, ICSs for the B3Πg state deviate considerably from the experimental cross sections. Sub-

sequently, they extended their R-matrix model to include the 8 lowest valence states[21]. Their

target CI wave functions were much improved from their previous work by employing valence

active space description, resulting in 68-120 CSFs per target state. In their paper, the ICSs were
shown for the A3Σ+
A3Σ+

u states, while the DCSs were presented for only the
u state. Agreement with the ICSs of Cartwright et al.[11] is good for these 4 excited states.

u , B3Πg, W 3∆u and B′3Σ−

However, agreement is marginal at DCS level.

In this work, we study electron impact excitation of N2 molecule by the ﬁxed nuclei R-matrix

method as in our previous work on electron O2 scatterings [22, 23]. Although theoretical treat-

ment is similar to the previous work of Gillan et al.[21], more target states and partial waves of a

scattering electron are included in the present work. Main purpose of this work is comparison of

ICSs as well as DCSs for the 8 lowest excited states with the experimental results of Cartwright

et al. [11], Brunger and Teubner[12], Campbell et al.[13], Khakoo et al. [2] and Johnson et al.[3].

This is because previous theoretical works have covered only a part of these 8 excitations.

In this paper, details of the calculation are presented in section 2, and we discuss the results in

section 3 comparing our ICSs and DCSs with the previous theoretical and available experimental

data. Then summary is given in section 4.

II. THEORETICAL METHODS

The R-matrix method itself has been described extensively in the literature [24, 25, 26] as well

as in our previous paper[22]. Thus we do not repeat general explanation of the method here.

We used a modiﬁed version of the polyatomic programs in the UK molecular R-matrix codes [24].

These programs utilize the gaussian type orbitals (GTO) to represent target electronic states as well

as a scattering electron. Although most of the previous R-matrix works in electron N2 collisions

have employed Slater type orbitals (STO), we select GTO mainly because of simplicity of the input

and availability of basis functions. In the R-matrix calculations, we have included 13 target states;
X1Σ+

u . The
potential energy curves of these target electronic states are shown in ﬁgure 1 for reference. These

u , a1Πg, w1∆u, C3Πu, E3Σ+

u , B3Πg, W 3∆u, B′3Σ−

g , c1Πu and c′1Σ+

g , a′′1Σ+

u , a′1Σ−

g , A3Σ+

target states were represented by valence conﬁguration interaction wave functions constructed by

state averaged complete active space SCF (SA-CASSCF) orbitals. Note that some target states,
E3Σ+

u , are Rydberg states and cannot be described adequately in the present
valence active space. Inclusion of these states are intended to improve quality of the R-matrix

g and c′1Σ+

g , a′′1Σ+

calculations by adding more target states in the model, as in our previous works [22, 23] as well

as other R-matrix works [27, 28]. Test calculation was performed with an extra 4ag orbital in the

target orbital set. However, the target excitation energies as well as the excitation cross sections

did not change much compared to the results with valence orbital set described above. Also,
removal of 3b1u orbital from target active space did not aﬀect the result much in our calculation.

In this study, the SA-CASSCF orbitals were obtained by calculations with MOLPRO suites of

programs [29]. The target orbitals were constructed from the [5s3p1d] level of basis set taken

from Sarpal et al. [30]. In our ﬁxed-bond R-matrix calculations, the target states were evaluated
at the equilibrium bond length R = 2.068 a0 of the N2 X1Σ+
g ground electronic state. Although we
also performed calculations with R = 2.100 a0 as in the previous R-matrix calculation of Gillan et
al.[21], the cross sections with R = 2.068 a0 and R = 2.100 a0 are almost the same. Thus, we will

only show the results with the equilibrium bond length of N2 in the next section. The radius of the

R-matrix sphere was chosen to be 10 a0 in our calculations. In order to represent the scattering
electron, we included diﬀuse gaussian functions up to l = 5, with 9 functions for l = 0, 7 functions
for l = 1 - 3 and 6 functions for l = 4 and 5. Exponents of these diﬀuse gaussians were ﬁtted using

the GTOBAS program [31] in the UK R-matrix codes. In addition to these continuum orbitals, we

included 8 extra virtual orbitals, one for each symmetry.

4

We constructed the 15-electron conﬁgurations from the orbitals listed in table I. The CI target

wave functions are composed of the valence orbitals in table I with the 1ag and 1b1u orbitals kept

doubly occupied. We have included 3 types of conﬁgurations in the calculation. The ﬁrst type of

conﬁgurations has the form,

1a2

g1b2

1u{2ag3ag1b2u1b3u2b1u3b1u1b3g1b2g}10

1Ag(cid:17) {5ag...39ag}1

(cid:16)

2Ag(cid:17) ,
(cid:16)

(1)

here we assume that the total symmetry of this 15 electrons system is 2Ag. The ﬁrst 4 electrons

are always kept in the 1ag and 1b1u orbitals, then the next 10 electrons are distributed over the
valence orbitals with restriction of target state symmetry, 1Ag symmetry of the N2 ground state
in this case. The last electron, the scattering electron, occupies one of the diﬀuse orbitals, of ag
symmetry in this example. To complete the wave function with the total symmetry 2Ag, we also
have to include conﬁgurations with the other target states combined with diﬀuse orbitals having

appropriate symmetry in the same way as in the example. The second type of conﬁgurations has

the form,

1a2

g1b2

1u{2ag3ag1b2u1b3u2b1u3b1u1b3g1b2g}10

1Ag(cid:17) {4ag}1
(cid:16)

2Ag(cid:17) ,
(cid:16)

(2)

where the scattering electron occupies a bound 4ag extra virtual orbital, instead of the diﬀuse

continuum orbitals in the expression (1). As in table I, we included one extra virtual orbital for

each symmetry. The third type of conﬁgurations has the form,

1a2

g1b2

1u{2ag3ag1b2u1b3u2b1u3b1u1b3g1b2g}11

2Ag(cid:17) .
(cid:16)

(3)

In this case, the last 11 electrons including the scattering electron are distributed over the valence

orbitals with the restriction of 2Ag symmetry. Note that the third type of conﬁgurations are crucial
in description of N−

2 resonance states, which often have dominant contributions to the excitation
cross sections. In this way, the number of conﬁgurations generated for a speciﬁc total symmetry

is typically about 60000, though the ﬁnal dimension of the inner region Hamiltonian is reduced to

be about 600 by using CI target contraction and prototype CI expansion method [32].

The R-matrix calculations were performed for all 8 irreducible representations of the D2h sym-

metry, Ag, B2u, B3u, B1g, B1u, B3g, B2g and Au, in doublet spin multiplicity of the electron plus target

system. DCSs were evaluated in the same way as in our previous paper[23].

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

A. Excitation energies

Figure 1 shows the potential energy curves of all N2 target states included in the present R-

matrix model. These curves were obtained by the same SA-CASSCF method employed in our

R-matrix calculation. Table II compares the excitation energies of the N2 target states from the

present calculation with the previous R-matrix results of Gillan et al.[21], multi-reference coupled

cluster results of Ben-Shlomo and Kaldor [33] as well as experimental values. Since these ener-
gies are evaluated at diﬀerent inter-nuclear distance, 2.068 a0 in our case, 2.100 a0 in Gillan et

al.[21] and 2.074 a0 in Ben-Shlomo and Kaldor [33], precise comparison is not so meaningful.

However, deviations of excitation energies from the experimental values are less than 0.8 eV in

our calculation, which is good considering the level of calculation. In terms of excitation energies,

are also well described in our SA-CASSCF calculation. In our calculation, N+
states are located at 15.63 and 17.21 eV above N2 X1Σ+

our calculation and the previous R-matrix calculation of Gillan et al.[21] have similar quality.
In addition to this good agreement of target energies with experimental results, N+

experimental values of 15.61 and 17.08 eV, our SA-CASSCF calculation gives good results. Note
that the energy ordering of N+
g and A2Πu states are not well described in the Hartree Fock

2 X2Σ+

level calculation, see Ermler and McLean [34] for example.

Integral cross sections

Figure 2 shows integral cross sections for electron impact excitation from the N2 X1Σ+

g state
u states. In this ﬁgure, present results are compared with the
previous R-matrix calculations of Gillan et al.[21], recent calculations of da Costa and Lima [35],

u , B3Πg, W 3∆u and B′3Σ−

to the A3Σ+

experimental results of Cartwright et al. [11], Campbell et al.[13] and recent measurements of

Johnson et al.[3]. Renormalized values of Cartwright et al. [11] are used as recommended by
Trajmar et al. [36]. Figure 3 compares the present excitation cross sections of the a′1Σ−
u , a1Πg,
w1∆u and C3Πu states with the previous experimental results of Cartwright et al. [11], Campbell
et al.[13] and Johnson et al.[3]. For the a1Πg state cross sections, the recent calculations of da

Costa and Lima [35], other experimental values of Ajello and Shemansky [5], Zetner and Trajmar
[10] and Mason and Newell [6] are included. For the C3Πu state cross sections, the experimental

results of Zubek [8], Zubek and King [9] and Poparic et al. [7] are included.

Other than the 2Πu symmetry partial cross sections, The 2Πg symmetry contributes to the ICSs

as a smooth background component (not shown in the ﬁgure). Compared to the previous R-

matrix cross sections, the peak at 12 eV is more pronounced in our case. Our results are slightly

larger than theirs at 12-17.5 eV. Compared to the recent experimental results of Johnson et al.[3],

our cross sections are about 50% larger at 12.5-20 eV, though 50% smaller at 10 eV. Also our

calculation overestimates the results of Campbell et al.[13], however, the results of Cartwright et

al. [11] agree well with our results except at 12.5 eV. The position of the resonance peak depends

rather strongly on the inter-nuclear distance of N2 molecule, which is 12.2 eV for 2.068 a0 and

11.75 eV for 2.100 a0 in our calculations. Thus, inclusion of vibrational motion may be necessary

to resolve this discrepancy of the resonance peak.

Our excitation cross sections for the B3Πg state have a small bump at 12.8 eV, which is not
2 12∆g state, with
g. Other than this bump, the ICSs are mostly composed of the 2Πg
symmetry contribution and have a shape similar to the previous R-matrix results. The magnitude of

main conﬁguration of 3σ1

g1π2

our ICSs is about 50% larger than the previous results of Gillan et al.[21]. Recently, da Costa and
Lima [35] calculated ICSs for the B3Πg state using the Schwinger multichannel method with the

minimal orbital basis for the single conﬁguration interactions (MOB-SCI) approach. There cross

sections are much larger than our results above 12 eV. Also, there is a prominent peak around 10

eV in their ICSs, which does not exist in the R-matrix calculations. Compared to the experimental

ICSs, our results agree well with the cross sections of Cartwright et al. [11], especially above 15

eV. However, the results of Campbell et al.[13] are much larger than ours. Recent measurements

of Johnson et al.[3] agree better with the previous R-matrix calculation of Gillan et al.[21].

For the excitation cross sections for the W 3∆u state, our results have a shape and magnitude
similar to the previous R-matrix results. Most of our ICSs are composed of the 2Πg symmetry

partial cross sections. Agreement with the experimental cross sections of Johnson et al.[3] is good

in this case. The cross sections of Campbell et al.[13] agree well with our results at 15 and 17.5

eV, but their value is about half as much as our result at 20 eV. The results of Cartwright et al. [11]

are about two times larger than our cross sections.

7

Our excitation cross sections for the B′3Σ−

u state are about half of the previous R-matrix cross
sections of Gillan et al.[21]. Apart from this diﬀerence in magnitude, the shape of the cross
sections is similar. Dominant component in these ICSs is the 2Πg symmetry partial cross sections,
although the 2Πu symmetry also has certain contribution around 18-20 eV. Among 3 diﬀerent

experimental measurements, our results agree well with the results of Johnson et al.[3]. The

experimental cross sections of other two groups are much larger than our results at 15 and 17.5 eV,
and have a diﬀerent energy dependence compared to the present calculation.

The situation of the excitation cross sections for the a′1Σ−
u state is similar to the case of the
u state. The 2Πg and 2Πu symmetry partial cross sections contribute almost equally to the
ICSs. Our cross sections roughly agree with the results of Johnson et al.[3], while the cross

B′3Σ−

sections of Cartwright et al. [11] and Campbell et al.[13] at 15 eV are much larger than our result.

The results of Cartwright et al. [11] and Campbell et al.[13] decrease as impact energy increases

from 15 to 20 eV, however, our cross sections increase mildly in this energy region.

In case of excitation to the a1Πg state, several other experimental results are available in addition

to the measurements of Cartwright et al. [11], Campbell et al.[13], and Johnson et al.[3]. The cross

section proﬁles of Johnson et al.[3], Ajello and Shemansky [5], Cartwright et al. [11] and Mason

and Newell [6] are similar to our ICSs. However, the magnitude of our cross sections is lower

than the experimental values in most case except the cross sections of Johnson et al.[3]. At 15,

17.5 and 20 eV, agreement of our results with the cross sections of Johnson et al.[3] is very good,

although our cross section at 12.5 eV is twice as large as their value. Note that there is no dominant

symmetry contribution to the calculated ICSs. All partial cross sections contribute rather equally

to the ICSs. Recent ICSs of da Costa and Lima [35] by the Schwinger multichannel method are

also shown in the panel (b) of the ﬁgure 3. Their result has a sharp peak at 12 eV as in their
calculation for the B3Πg state excitation. This diﬀerence between our and their results may come
from diﬀerent number of target states considered in the scattering calculation. Only the X1Σ1
g,
a1Πg and B3Πg states were included in the calculations of da Costa and Lima. The other part of

the cross section proﬁle is similar to the shape of our cross sections, although the magnitude of

their cross sections are about twice as large as our results at 15-20 eV.

Our excitation cross section for the w1∆u state gradually increases as a function of energy

from the threshold to the broad peak around 17.5 eV, then decreases toward 20 eV. In this case,

agreement with the results of Johnson et al.[3] is not so good compared to the excitations of the
a1Πg and a′1Σ−

u states. Our cross sections are about 50% larger than their values at 17.5 and 20 eV.

8

At 15 eV, our results agree well with the cross section of Johnson et al.[3], however, they are about

50% lower than the results of Cartwright et al. [11] and Campbell et al.[13]. In the calculated
ICSs, the 2Πu symmetry partial cross section is a major component, with a minor contribution
from the 2Πg symmetry.

The calculated excitation cross sections for the C3Πu state has a peak similar to the experimental

results of Zubek [8] and Poparic et al.[7]. Although the shape of the cross sections is similar,
position of the cross section peak is diﬀerent from experimental results. In our case, it is located at

about 17 eV, whereas corresponding peaks are located at 14 eV in the experimental cross sections.

The height of the peak in our ICSs is lower than the experimental values of Zubek [8] and Poparic

et al.[7]. It is unclear whether there is a cross section peak in the experimental cross sections of

Cartwright et al. [11], Campbell et al.[13] and Johnson et al.[3]. At least, it appears that they do

not have a peak around 17 eV. The origin of this discrepancy in the cross section peak is uncertain,
but may be related to the employment of the ﬁxed-nuclei approximation or insuﬃciency of higher
excited target states in the R-matrix model. The calculated ICSs are composed of the 2Σ+
2Σ−

u and
u symmetry partial cross sections near the peak structure at 17 eV. The contribution of the 2Σ+
u component. Other than these two symmetries, the 2Πg

symmetry is about 50% larger than the 2Σ−

u

symmetry partial cross section contributes to the ICSs as a smooth background component.

C. Diﬀerential cross sections

Figure 4 shows calculated DCSs for excitation of the A3Σ+

u state with the experimental results
of Khakoo et al. [2], Brunger and Teubner [12], Cartwright et al. [11], Zetner and Trajmar [10],

LeClair and Trajmar [37] and the previous R-matrix DCSs of Gillan et al.[21]. Our DCSs at 12.5,

15 and 17.5 eV have similar shape in common. They are enhanced in backward direction and

have a small dimple at 120 degrees with a bump at 75 degrees. At 17.5 eV, our cross sections

are located between the experimental values of Khakoo et al.[2] and Cartwright et al. [11]. The

proﬁle of the experimental DCSs are reproduced well in our calculation. At 15 eV, our results agree

better with the results of Khakoo et al. [2] compared to the other experiments. In the DCSs of

the previous R-matrix calculation of Gillan et al.[21], a bump is located at 40 degrees and a small

dimple is located at 100 degrees, which agree better with the experimental results of Brunger and

Teubner[12]. In our calculation, these dimple and bump are shifted toward backward direction by

20 degrees, and agreement with the results of Brunger and Teubner [12] is not so good. At 12.5

9

eV, our calculation overestimates the experimental results by a factor of two. As seen in panel (a)

of Fig.2, this discrepancy is related to the existence of a resonance peak around 12.5 eV.

Figure 5 compares calculated excitation DCSs for the B3Πg state with the experimental and

recent theoretical results. Our DCSs at 12.5, 15 and 17.5 eV have backward-enhanced feature

with a broad peak at 130 degrees. At 15 and 17.5 eV, our DCSs agree well with the results of

Khakoo et al. [2] at forward direction below 80 degrees. However, their DCSs are smaller than

ours by a factor of two at 80-130 degrees. Agreement with the results of Cartwright et al. [11] at

15 eV is good at 20-130 degrees, although their DCSs are twice as large as our DCSs at 17.5 eV for

low scattering angles. Because of a resonance-like feature at 12.5 eV as seen in panel (b) of Fig.2,

our results are larger than the experimental results at 12.5 eV. Recent Schwinger multi-channel

results of da Costa and Lima [35] are much larger than our DCSs at 12.5 and 15 eV. The deviation
is especially large at 12.5 eV, which is possibly related to the diﬀerence in the excitation energies

of the target state.

Figure 6 shows the excitation DCSs for the W 3∆u state with the experimental cross sections.

At 15 and 17.5 eV, our cross section gradually increases as a function of scattering angle, without

noticeable bump or dip. At 12.5 eV, the shape of DCSs is nearly symmetric around 90 degrees.

Agreement with the experimental DCSs of Khakoo et al. [2] is good, although their results at

15 and 17.5 eV have more complex structure such as a small peak at 80 degrees. Our DCSs are

generally smaller than the other experimental results of Brunger and Teubner[12], Cartwright et

al. [11], Zetner and Trajmar [10].

Excitation cross sections for the B′3Σ−

u state are shown in ﬁgure 7. Calculated DCSs decrease
to be zero toward 0 and 180 degrees, because of a selection rule associated with Σ+-Σ− transition

[38, 39]. Our DCSs have a broad single peak near 90 degrees at 12.5 and 15 eV, whereas there are

two broad peaks at 17.5 eV. The position of the right peak at 17.5 eV coincides with that of the

experimental DCSs of Khakoo et al. [2] and Cartwright et al. [11], although the peak of Cartwright

et al. [11] is much higher than ours. Our results agree well with the DCSs of Khakoo et al. [2] at

15 and 17.5 eV. However, their cross sections at 15 eV have a small dip at 100 degrees and a small

bump 60 degrees, which do not exist in our results. At 12.5 eV, our cross sections are slightly

larger than the results of Khakoo et al.[2]. On the whole, agreement with the other experimental

results of Brunger and Teubner [12] and Cartwright et al. [11] is not good.

Figure 8 shows the excitation DCSs for the a′1Σ−

at 0 and 180 degrees become zero as in the case of the B′3Σ−

u state. Because of Σ+-Σ− selection rule, DCSs
u state DCSs. Calculated DCSs have a

10

broad single peak near 60 degrees at 12.5 and 15 eV. At 17.5 eV, there are two broad peaks at 50

and 120 degrees. Although there is slight overestimation of DCSs near 50-60 degrees, our DCSs

agree marginally with the results of Khakoo et al.[2]. Agreement with the other experimental

results is not good except low scattering angles at 17.5 eV.

Figure 9 compares our excitation DCSs for the a1Πg state with the experimental cross sec-

tions. Because of large variation of the DCSs, the cross sections are shown in logarithmic scale.

Calculated DCSs are strongly forward-enhanced, which is consistent with all experimental results

shown in the ﬁgure. Our DCSs at 12.5 eV have a small dip around 100 degrees, which moves

forward to 85 degrees at 15 eV and 75 degrees at 17.5 eV. This behavior roughly agrees with the

results of Cartwright et al.[11] and Khakoo et al.[2]. At 15 eV, our DCSs agree better with the

results of Khakoo et al.[2] than the other experimental DCSs. At 17.5 eV, the results of Cartwright

et al.[11] are closer to our DCSs at scattering angles above 40 degrees. Below 40 degrees, our

calculation signiﬁcantly underestimates the experimental DCSs. Our results at 12.5 eV are located

between the DCSs of Cartwright et al. [11] and Khakoo et al.[2], however the shape of the DCSs

is similar to their results. The shapes of DCSs calculated by da Costa and Lima [35] are similar to

our results. However, their cross sections are larger than our results at low-scattering angles below

80 degrees, where their results agree better with the experimental DCSs of Brunger and Teubner

[12] and Zetner and Trajmar [10].

Figure 10 shows calculated excitation DCSs for the w1∆u state with the experimental cross
sections. Our DCSs are enhanced in forward direction as in the case of the a1Πg state. However,
magnitude of the enhancement is much smaller than that of the a1Πg state. Agreement with the

DCSs of Cartwright et al. [11] is good at 17.5 eV except low scattering angles below 20 degrees.

At 12.5 and 15 eV, their results are much larger than our DCSs. At 15 eV, our DCSs agree
marginally with the results of Khakoo et al. [2], although details of the DCS proﬁle are diﬀerent.

Their results are smaller than ours at 17.5 and 12.5 eV. Discrepancy is especially large for forward

scattering at 12.5 eV.

Figure 11 shows excitation DCSs for the C3Πu state with the experimental cross sections of

Khakoo et al.[2], Brunger and Teubner[12], Zubek and King [9] and Cartwright et al. [11]. Cal-

culated DCS proﬁles are almost ﬂat at 12.5 and 15 eV, whereas they are enhanced in backward

direction at 17.5 eV. Below 90 degrees, slope of the calculated DCSs at 17.5 eV is similar to the

results of Khakoo et al.[2], Zubek and King [9] and Cartwright et al. [11], though our results are

about 50% larger than their DCSs. In general, our results do not agree well with the experimental

11

DCSs. Although the ICS of Khakoo et al. [2] at 15 eV agrees well our result as shown in panel (d)
of Fig.3, angular dependence of the cross sections appears to be diﬀerent.

D. Discussion

The excitation ICSs of the B3Πg state, shown in panel (b) of ﬁgure 2, have a small bump around

13 eV. However, there is no such structure in the previous R-matrix ICSs of Gillan et al. [21]. The

origin of this bump in our calculation is the N−

2 12∆g state, with main conﬁguration of 3σ1
2 12∆g state can also be veriﬁed by usual CASSCF calculation on N−

g1π2
g.
The existence of the N−
2 with
valence active space ignoring continuum orbitals. In molpro calculation, the energy of the 12∆g
state is 15.7 eV. Since diﬀuse continuum orbitals are added in the R-matrix calculation, the energy

of the state is stabilized to be 12.8 eV in the present scattering calculation. In the same way, the

N−
2

2Πu (1π3

u excitation ICSs can be veriﬁed by usual CASSCF
calculation. In molpro calculation, it is located at 14.7 eV, whereas the position of the resonance

g) resonance peak in the A3Σ+

u1π2

is stabilized to be 12.2 eV in our R-matrix scattering calculation. It is unclear why the bump
in the ICSs of the B3Πg state is not evident in the previous R-matrix cross sections of Gillan et
al.[21]. Some details of the R-matrix calculations are diﬀerent in their calculation and ours, e.g.,

they used hybrid orbitals with Slater type functions, whereas we employed SA-CASSCF orbitals
with Gaussian type functions. These diﬀerence may contribute to the diﬀerence in magnitude of
the 2∆g partial cross section.

In this study, we employed the ﬁxed-nuclei (FN) approximation. As we can see in ﬁgure 1,

equilibrium bond lengths of the excited N2 states are longer than that of the ground state. Thus, in
principle, it would be desirable to include the eﬀect of nuclear motion in the R-matrix calculation.

Use of the FN approximation may be responsible for several discrepancies between our calculation
and experiments, including bumps in the ICSs of the A3Σ+
u and B3Πg states, the position of the peak
in the ICSs of the C3Πu state. Although the calculated DCSs agree very well with experimental
results in general, our DCSs of the A3Σ+
u , B3Πg, w1∆u and C3Πu states at 12.5 eV are 2-4 times
larger than experimental results. These deviations in the near-threshold DCSs can also be related to

the FN approximation. In spite of these discrepancies, good agreements are observed between our

calculation and experiments in most ICS and DCS cases as we can see in the ﬁgures. Agreements

with the recent experimental results of Khakoo et al.[2] and Johnson et al.

[3] are especially

impressive. It is possible to include nuclear motion in the R-matrix formalism through vibrational

12

averaging of T-matrix elements or the non-adiabatic R-matrix method, though application of these
methods will be a diﬃcult task in the presence of many target electronic states. In the future, we

plan to perform the R-matrix calculation with these methods including nuclear motion.

IV. SUMMARY

method which includes 13 target electronic states, X1Σ+
w1∆u, C3Πu, E3Σ+

We have investigated electron impact excitations of N2 molecule using the ﬁxed-bond R-matrix
u , a1Πg,
u . These target states are described by CI wave functions
in the valence CAS space, using SA-CASSCF orbitals. Gaussian type orbitals were used in this

u , B3Πg, W 3∆u, B′3Σ−

g , c1Πu and c′1Σ+

g , a′′1Σ+

u , a′1Σ−

g , A3Σ+

work, in contrast to the STOs in the previous R-matrix works. We have obtained integral cross
sections as well as diﬀerential cross sections of excitations to the A3Σ+
u , a′1Σ−
u ,
a1Πg, w1∆u and C3Πu states, which have been studied a lot experimentally but not enough theo-
retically before. In general, good agreements are observed both in the integrated and diﬀerential

u , B3Πg, W 3∆u, B′3Σ−

cross sections, which is encouraging for further theoretical and experimental studies in this ﬁeld.
However, some discrepancies are seen in the integrated cross sections of the A3Σ+
u and C3Πu states,
especially around a peak structure. Also, our DCSs do not agree well with the experimental re-

sults at low impact energy of 12.5 eV, compared to the higher energies of 15 and 17.5 eV. These
discrepancies may be related to the ﬁxed-nuclei approximation or insuﬃciency of higher excited

target states in the R-matrix model.

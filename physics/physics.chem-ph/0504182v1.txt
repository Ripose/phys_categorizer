We discuss the eﬀect of the local ﬁeld polarization in metallic nanostructures where large ﬁeld
enhancements can be induced by excitation of localized surface plasmons. To demonstrate the
importance of these eﬀects, we study a few model systems in 2D and 3D. As an experimental probe
of this eﬀect, we suggest to use depolarization ratios in Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy
(SERS) measurements. We attempt to relate the polarization of the local ﬁeld to the depolarization
ratios in SERS conditions. This approach could also lead to some better understanding of the SERS
mechanisms at a microscopic level.

INTRODUCTION

Raman depolarization ratios of molecular vibrations
are one of the most fundamental properties of inelastic
light scattering in liquids[1]; they are widely used in con-
junction with other types of spectroscopies to infer indi-
rectly the symmetry of molecular vibrational modes. Es-
sentially, every vibration in a molecule can be assigned
to a given irreducible representation (or linear combina-
tions of them) of either the overall symmetry point group
of the molecule or one of its sub-structures. Once the
symmetry is known the Raman tensor of the vibration
with respect to a ﬁxed molecular coordinates system is
also known. A collection of randomly oriented molecules
will produce average intensities for parallel (Ik) or per-
pendicularly (I⊥) polarized scattering conﬁgurations in
Raman spectroscopy, from where a well deﬁned depolar-
ization ratio ρ ≡ I⊥/Ik follows. Both (Ik) and (I⊥) only
depend on tensor invariants which do not change under
rotations of the reference frame. This is a canonical text-
book problem in non-resonant inelastic light scattering of
liquids and poly-crystalline solids[1], which has also its
exact counterpart in elastic (Rayleigh) scattering (with
the linear polarizability tensor playing the role of the
Raman tensor)[2]. There is ample theoretical and exper-
imental understanding of this eﬀect in Raman scattering,
which started with the pioneering work of Porto, Skinner,
and Nielsen[3, 4] in the 60’s in the angular dependence
of inelastic light scattering of simple liquids.

Notwithstanding, under Surface Enhanced Raman
Scattering (SERS) conditions in liquids (colloids) de-
polarization ratios of Raman signals of the analyte
molecules (typically dyes) are most of the time anoma-

lous and, in addition, show some laser wavelength depen-
dence. It is interesting to understand the origin of these
anomalies for such a fundamental physical property of
the scattering process like the depolarization ratio. The
problem is intimately related to the issue of local ﬁelds in
SERS and in plasmon-supporting structures in general.
SERS is made possible by highly localized plasmon res-
onance excitations called hot-spots, which achieve large
optical ampliﬁcations and boost Raman scattering sig-
nals by several orders of magnitude[5, 6]. Highly (sub-
wavelength) localized hot-spots have been proposed and
studied both theoretically[7, 8] and experimentally[9, 10,
11]. It is the purpose of this paper to shed some light on
the polarization aspects of hot-spots and how they aﬀect
basic properties of the symmetry of the scattering. We
also explore how these eﬀects could be used in principle
to learn more about the nature of hot-spots, local ﬁelds,
and laser-ﬁeld ampliﬁcations by plasmons.

We would like to address in the paper two main issues:

• Local-ﬁeld polarization eﬀects are often overlooked
in most treatments of the SERS eﬀect, but should
be important for many essential properties of the
scattering process. We shall show that depolariza-
tion ratios are mainly determined by plasmons in
a SERS environment. The most striking demon-
stration of this eﬀect is the breakdown of normal
depolarization ratios in single isolated objects, as
demonstrated in the next sections.

• Depolarization ratios can, in principle, assert some-
thing about the SERS enhancement mechanism it-
self and, in addition, the equally important issue of
molecular orientation and geometry of the analyte
on the metallic surface.

All these issues will be addressed with a variety of
examples for diﬀerent geometries and assumptions, to-
gether with some experimental evidence for anomalous
depolarization ratios at the end.

II. BASIC DEFINITIONS

A. Basic geometries and Raman tensors

2

SERS enhancements by one or several objects depend
on the geometry of the objects themselves, their symme-
try, and their orientation in space with respect to the
ﬁxed scattering polarization directions in the laboratory
frame. In addition, the scattering can come from a single
analyte (molecule) in a speciﬁc place on the surface of
the metal, or from the multiple contributions of a distri-
bution of molecules in many places. Last, but not least,
the Raman tensor of the analyte can be of many dif-
ferent types (symmetries); hence the orientation of the
main axes of the tensor with respect to the metal surface
at speciﬁc points has to be speciﬁed also. In eﬀect, the
possibilities are endless. We need to start by imposing
some restrictions on the type of objects, Raman tensors,
and molecular orientations at the surface that we will
examine.

We ﬁrst address the issue of the origin of the SERS sig-
nal in terms of single/multiple dyes contributions. Inter-
pretations of the data based on single molecule detection
have been claimed many times in the past[15, 16, 17].
If single molecule detection is achievable then the po-
larization properties of the local ﬁeld at the position of
the molecule will be the only parameter that counts.
The same situation happens if the presence of analyte
is widespread over the metal but there are high inten-
sity hot-spots dominating the signal. In such a situation,
the polarization properties of a speciﬁc place in space
and/or the orientation of the Raman tensor of one or a
few molecules are the main factors determining the sym-
metry of the scattering event. The polarization proper-
ties would then be an average (over time or space) of
many of these hot-spots. Polarization studies in SERS in
single molecule limits are very rare[18, 19] and not fully
understood in our opinion.

The most common experimental situation, however, is
one in which there are many contributions from many an-
alytes which are spatially distributed in diﬀerent places
and, accordingly, are exposed to diﬀerent local ﬁelds.
This is for example the case of colloidal solutions of gold
or silver particles at relatively high (∼ 100 nM) concen-
tration of analyte and measured in immersion. If con-
ditions are chosen so that the solution is stable, we can
rule out the presence of large clusters of particles (which
would precipitate) and the signal must therefore come
from single particles or possibly pairs of particles (either
stable pairs or dynamical pairs formed during close en-
In order to observe a good
counters of two particles).
SERS signal from such solutions, higher analyte concen-
trations are required, corresponding typically to ∼102-
104 molecules per particle. To study the polarization
eﬀects in such systems, one has to consider the signals
of all these molecules and also average over all possible
orientations of the particles. This is only possible in sim-
ple cases and it is the main reason for the restrictions we
shall impose in the modelling.

We shall discuss here a few model cases: spherical par-
ticles, elliptical particles, and dimers (two particles in
close proximity). In each case, we will model the SERS
depolarization ratio, which can be measured experimen-
tally, under diﬀerent assumptions.

There are three main factors that can aﬀect the calcu-

lated depolarization ratio ρ.

• The Raman tensor of the probe molecules: We will
consider the cases of an isotropic Raman tensor
(Iso) and of a uniaxial tensor. These are two ex-
treme cases of a variety of molecular symmetries
present in real analytes. Many common SERS an-
alytes (like rhodamine 6G) have strongly uniaxial
Raman tensors for most of their vibrations.

• The adsorption conﬁguration of the molecule: This
is obviously an important factor when the Raman
tensor is not isotropic. For the uniaxial case, we
therefore need a further assumption about the way
the molecule adsorbs on the metal surface and, in
particular, how the main axis is oriented with re-
spect to the surface. We will consider the two ex-
treme cases of a molecule adsorbed with its axis
tangential (T an) or normal (N orm) to the surface.
We will also consider the case where the adsorption
geometry is random (Rand). In this latter case, all
possible orientations of the molecules are consid-
ered and averaged.

• Finally, the way the molecule couples to the local
ﬁeld polarization: This is also a very important
aspect because it is directly related to the SERS
enhancements mechanism and has in our opinion
been overlooked.

We shall have a small digression on this latter issue
here.
If we consider a molecule with a highly uniaxial
Raman tensor oriented along ~em, then the excited dipole
has the form (case A):

~pA = α

~E · ~em

~em,

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

(1)

where ~E is the local electric ﬁeld and α is the main com-
ponent of the uniaxial polarizability. This is a case of-
ten found in normal Raman scattering. The intensity
scattered and detected in the far ﬁeld in a given direc-
tion ~ed, along a given polarization ~ep (~ep ⊥ ~ed) is then
2
I ∝ |~p · ~ep|
. However, if we use this expression in SERS
conditions, the SERS signal is only proportional to the
power of two of the local ﬁeld enhancement factor (and
not power of four as usually assumed[5]). In order to ob-
tain a power of four in the scattering eﬃciency, we need
to model the enhancement process due to re-emission of
this dipole. One could use the following expression (case

B):

and

~pB =

α| ~E|
| ~E0| (cid:16)

~E · ~em

~em.

(cid:17)

Anywise,
this implies that the enhancement in re-
emission has no polarization dependence. Another view
is to assume that the excited dipole couples only to the
local ﬁeld enhancement along its direction; we then get
(case C):

~pC =

α
| ~E0| (cid:16)

~E · ~em

~em.

2

(cid:17)

In both cases, we have also assumed that the local ﬁeld
enhancements relevant to re-emission were the same as
those derived for excitation. This is a common assump-
tion but is not necessarily valid. Assuming we know the
local ﬁeld enhancements for a given geometry, we can
then calculate the polarization property of the SERS sig-
nal for each of the cases A, B, and C at each point of the
surface S of our metallic structure/s. These can then be
integrated over the surface, assuming a continuous dis-
tribution of probe molecules of type Iso, T an, N orm, or
Rand.

Similar expressions for T an−A, −B, −C replacing ~n with
~t are also obtained. Expressions for I⊥ are obtained by
replacing z subscripts with y. We will also for each case
estimate the total SERS intensity by means of:

IT ot = Ik + I⊥.

(9)

For structures without rotational symmetry, the cal-
culations were repeated for 50 diﬀerent orientations, pa-
rameterized by an angle β. The total signals are then
obtained by summing over all possible orientations. In
our structures, we need only to consider β from 0 to π/2
by symmetry, so we have:

B. Symmetries and averages

As an example, and to provide a basis for further dis-
cussion, we carried out calculations for simple model sys-
tems in 2 dimensions (2D). The structures are in the
plane (yOz) and the exciting beam is coming from the
perpendicular direction (Ox), with a ﬁeld polarization
along z. The local ﬁelds at the surface are calculated
within the electrostatics approximation. The calcula-
tions were carried out numerically using ﬁnite element
modelling described elsewhere[20]. We assume that the
signal is detected in the far ﬁeld along (Ox) and analyzed
for parallel (Oz) and perpendicular (Oy) polarizations.
For a given structure, we calculated Ik and I⊥ for each
of our assumptions. ~n (~t) denotes the unit normal (tan-
gential) vector at any point on the metallic surface. We
therefore used the following expressions:

In most simulations of metallic structures presented in
the literature, such as for ellipses or dimers, only one
In liquids,
or two possible orientations are considered.
contributions from all orientations are averaged and the
resulting intensity proﬁle can be very diﬀerent to that
of a single conﬁguration.
Independent of polarization
eﬀects, we believe that the orientation-averaged SERS
intensity proﬁles presented here provides a new insight
into plasmon resonances in liquids.

For the Rand cases, one has to consider all possible

molecular orientations. In 2D we restrict ourselves to:

~em = cos(γ)~ey + sin(γ)~ez.

(12)

Estimating the intensities and averaging over γ, one ﬁnds
that the results Rand − B and Rand − C can be directly
obtained from that of Iso − B (also equal to Iso − C),

As a reminder, in non-SERS conditions in 2 dimen-
sions, ρ should be 0 for an isotropic molecule and 1/3 for
the uniaxial case (Rand).

For all calculations, we used the bulk dielectric con-
stant of Ag (a typical metal for SERS applications) as
reproduced by a Drude model with the best ﬁt to tabu-
lated data in the region of interest[21], namely:

III. THE SIMPLEST CASE: SERS BY A SINGLE
SYMMETRIC OBJECT

A simple object like a disk in 2D or a sphere in 3D
has a well deﬁned main plasmon resonance. If the size
of the object (a) is much smaller than the wavelength
(a ≪ λ) of the light, then the electrostatic approxima-
tion is valid and the resonance occurs at the frequency
where Re(ǫ(λ)) ≈ −ǫm, or −2ǫm for a disk in 2D or a
sphere in 3D, respectively. If (a ∼ λ) on the contrary, re-
tardation eﬀects and higher order multipoles play an in-
creasing role and deﬁne additional resonances. The cur-
rent understanding of the SERS eﬀect is that it beneﬁts
from red-shifted plasmon resonances[12] which are either
shape/size-related or, more often than not, coming from
plasmon-plasmon interactions among particles[13, 14].
These latter resonances are believed to be the dominant
contribution to the SERS signal in general.

The case of a 2D sphere (or disk) of radius a, is partic-
ularly easy because of the rotational symmetry (no need
for diﬀerent β’s in the averaging).
It can also be eas-
ily solved analytically in the electrostatic approximation.
We consider an Ag-disk with complex dielectric function
ǫ(λ) in water (ǫm = 1.77). The important parameter in
such problem is the relative dielectric constant ǫr = ǫ/ǫm.
For an incident ﬁeld ~E0 = 1~ez, the local ﬁeld at a point
on the surface with coordinates a, θ is simply the super-
position of the incident ﬁeld and of an induced dipolar
ﬁeld:

with

Ey(θ) = k sin(2θ),

Ez(θ) = 1 − k cos(2θ),

k =

ǫr − 1
ǫr + 1

.

ρIso−A =

|k|2/2
1 + |k|2/2

,

(18)

(19)

(20)

(21)

We can therefore derive the following analytical expres-
sions:

where ρRand−B and ρRand−C can also be evaluated an-
alytically from the expression of ρIso−B using Eqs. (13)
and (15).

Figure 1 shows the wavelength dependence of the depo-
larization ratio under the various assumptions considered
here. An important aspect to help distinguish these cases
is also the total SERS intensity, which is not reﬂected in
the values of ρ. We know that the SERS signal is usually
strong enough to be detected, and any valid assumption
should therefore predict a reasonably strong SERS signal
in addition to a correct depolarization ratio. We show in
Fig. 1 the calculated SERS intensity as a function of
wavelength. As can be expected, the three cases where
the SERS enhancement is only proportional to the square
of the ﬁeld amplitude (cases A) show a relatively small
SERS intensity. These three cases will therefore not be
studied any further. All the other cases show a strong en-
hancement at the localized surface plasmon resonance of
the object (Re(ǫ) = −ǫm, λ ∼ 339 nm in this case). For
T an − B and T an − C, this enhancement drops sharply
beyond this resonance, while a small enhancement still
exists in the other cases.

This is a very interesting case for more than one rea-
son. It is interesting to see how a large variety of cases
is observed for ρ in an object which is arguably one of
the simplest SERS enhancing object we can think of. In
some cases, ρ = 1/3 and is independent of wavelength
(N orm − A, T an − A) or 1/5 (N orm − C, T an − C). In
other cases, it increases to 1 close to the surface plasmon
resonance and decreases slowly beyond that, towards a
limiting value of 1/5 (Iso − B), 5/13 (Rand − C), or 1/2
(Rand − B). T an − B and N orm − B show a somewhat
diﬀerent behavior, the ﬁrst showing an increase towards
1, while the latter peaks sharply at 1 before the surface
plasmon resonance.

Conceptually, it is interesting to see that for the case
of an isotropic probe (which should exhibit ρ = 0 in
free space) ρ can be as large as 1 as a result of the
interaction with the metallic disk (Iso − B at reso-
nance). This is surprising because the disk itself is also
isotropic, but the anisotropy is introduced by excitation
of non-isotropic dipolar plasmon resonances in the object.

This demonstrates clearly that the localized plasmon res-
onances are crucial in the polarization mechanisms and
cannot be excluded from the discussion. It is even clear
from Fig. 1 that the plasmon resonances, and not the
probe molecules, are the dominant factor in the origin of
the depolarization ratios; what counts is the symmetry of
the plasmon resonance for the polarization properties of
the scattering. This summarizes in many ways one of the
most important points of this paper.

It is interesting to see, in addition, the reasons for the
inﬂuence of plasmon resonances in terms of ﬁeld patterns
for the simplest possible case treated in this section. In a
way, all the other eﬀects are further degrees of sophisti-
cation of this simple example. Figure 2 shows for this 2D
case the intensity patterns on the surface for an incident
2
, and the total ﬁeld
polarization along z of |Ez|
~E
, at three diﬀerent wavelengths chosen to be below,
(cid:12)
(cid:12)
at, and above the main surface plasmon resonance of the
(cid:12)
object (λ = 339 nm). The case can be solved analytically
and all the patterns can be interpreted as a direct super-
position of the external ﬁeld and an equivalent induced
dipole on the disk. It is the complex polarizability of the
metal that makes the dipole response non-trivial because
of the relative amplitude and phase shift of the response
with respect to the exciting ﬁeld. From Fig. 2 we can see
that even if we had molecules with an isotropic Raman
tensor (emitting in the same direction as the excitation),
the depolarization ratio will be changing with wavelength.
Ignoring the Stokes shift, the integrated intensity on the
2
surface for |Ey|
will give the
depolarization ratio at that wavelength. It is easy to infer
by visual inspection that the depolarization ratio will be
small at λ = 312 nm, large at resonance (λ = 339 nm),
and small again at longer wavelengths (λ = 364 nm).
It is large (close to 1) at resonance because the induced
dipolar response completely dominates the signal. The
(analytical) example in Fig. 2 is possibly the simplest
example of plasmons aﬀecting the Raman depolarization
ratio by changing the nature of the coupling between the
laser and the molecules through the local ﬁeld. In prac-
tise the Raman tensor of the molecule itself will play a
role, adding an additional degree of complexity to the
problem.

2
divided by that for |Ez|

As we shall show later for a particular analyte with
a uniaxial Raman tensor, SERS experiments on col-
loidal solutions show that the depolarization ratio indeed
changes with wavelength and ranges from 0.4 to 0.7 in our
measurements. This observation therefore rules out some
of the cases studied here. We can identify three cases
which are compatible with this observation and predict
a reasonable SERS intensity: Iso − B, Rand − B, and
Rand − C. In order to determine which of these cases is
the most realistic, one ﬁrst needs to look at more real-
istic models. It is in particular important to determine
the eﬀect on ρ of diﬀerent particle shapes and to assess
the validity of using a 2D model to infer 3D properties.
Finally retardation eﬀects (not taken into account in the

5

electrostatics approximation) can have some inﬂuence on
the plasmon resonances and therefore also on ρ. We ad-
dress some of these issues in the next sections.

IV. SHAPE EFFECTS

To understand at least qualitatively the eﬀects of
shape, we will consider the case of an ellipse with an
aspect ratio between long and short axes of 1.5. Be-
cause we now loose the rotational symmetry, we consider
the contributions to the SERS signal from ellipses with
50 possible orientations. Figure 3 shows the calculated
total SERS intensity under diﬀerent assumptions. As ex-
pected, the plasmon resonance is now split into two reso-
nances: one red-shifted at 363 nm, the other blue-shifted
at 320 nm. In many instances in the literature, excita-
tions along one or the other principal axis are usually
considered separately and only one resonance is observed
at a time. Both resonances are observed here because all
possible orientations are considered and summed. Figure
3 also shows the predicted depolarization ratios. Again,
a wide variety of diﬀerent behaviors are observed, but we
will concentrate on the three cases identiﬁed previously:
Iso − B, Rand − B, and Rand − C. All three show a
similar pattern with ρ peaking for λ = 340 nm to a value
at 0.8 − 0.9, then at λ = 388 nm to a value of 0.6 − 0.8,
and then decreasing to the same limiting value as that
observed for the disk.

It is interesting to note that the peaks of ρ do not cor-
relate exactly with the plasmon resonances observed in
the SERS intensity. The ﬁrst peak remains at the plas-
mon resonance of a sphere, while the second appears at
even longer wavelength than the red-shifted plasmon res-
onance. Also, the maximum value of ρ is now slightly
smaller than 1. This can have some important conse-
quences for colloidal solutions with a distribution of sizes
and shapes. For a given excitation wavelength λL, the
SERS signal should have a larger contribution from parti-
cles in resonance with this wavelength. If there are many
such particles, the depolarization ratio will be determined
by these and will then correspond to the dip in Fig. 3 at
363 nm (i.e. ρ is smaller than its maximum value). How-
ever, if λL is longer than most particle resonances, the
measured ρ should correspond to values to the right of
the dip in Fig. 3. This could lead to an increase in ρ if
λL remains close to most resonances, or to a decrease at
much longer wavelength. Such considerations are impor-
tant when interpreting experimental results in colloidal
solutions because polydiversity is inevitable.

V. CASE OF A 3D SPHERE

It could be argued that conclusions gained from 2D
models on depolarization ratios should be taken with
care; it is necessary to estimate the changes that will
arise from looking at real 3D cases to gain some insight

6

(36)

(37)

(42)

(44)

on how reliable the qualitative predictions of 2D models
are. Numerical simulations in 3D are much more com-
putationally demanding than the 2D cases. To assess
the importance of the corrections arising from a full 3D
model, we will therefore study the case of a 3D sphere and
compare qualitatively the results to the 2D case. Simi-
lar to the 2D disk, the 3D sphere problem can be solved
analytically in the electrostatics approximation. For an
incident ﬁeld ~E0 = 1~ez, the local ﬁeld outside the sphere
is simply the superposition of the incident ﬁeld and of an
induced dipolar ﬁeld:

~E = 3κ cos(θ)~er + (1 − κ)~ez,

(27)

where (r, θ, φ) are the standard spherical coordinates and

κ =

ǫr − 1
ǫr + 2

.

(28)

and

Calculations can be carried out in a similar way as for
the 2D case. To illustrate this, we describe below the
N orm − C, T an − C, and Iso − B cases.

In the N orm − C case, the molecules are assumed to
be adsorbed with their main axis normal to the metal
surface. The parallel and perpendicular intensities are
therefore given by:

The depolarization ratio is then independent of wave-
length and equal to ρN orm−C = 1/5, which is the same
result as that obtained in 2D.

For the case of T an − C, we assume the molecule is
adsorbed with its axis tangential to the metallic surface.
However, in 3D, this does not deﬁne completely the ori-
entation of the axis, and we therefore need to average
over all possible orientations of the molecular axis (tan-
gential to the surface). For this, we assume the axis to
be along the unit vector:

~em = cos γ~eθ + sin γ~eφ.

and

We then calculate:

Averaging over γ (0 ≤ γ ≤ 2π), we obtain:

The depolarization ratio is therefore again ρT an−C =
1/5, independent of wavelength and equal to the 2D case.
In the 2D section, we identiﬁed the cases Iso − B,
Rand − B, and Rand − C as the most interesting. The
Iso − B case can be calculated analytically, to wit:

These results are plotted in Fig. 4, with the equiva-
lent 2D results for comparison. We ﬁrst notice, as ex-
pected, that the resonance proﬁle of the SERS intensity
is further red-shifted in the 3D case, peaking at 388 nm
(Re(ǫr) = −2) instead of 339 nm (Re(ǫr) = −1). Re-
garding the depolarization ratios, they show the same
qualitative behavior as in 2D with some small quanti-
tative changes: they are smaller for the 3D case below
the plasmon resonance, and slightly larger beyond this

resonance tending towards the same value at long wave-
length. Also, the maximum depolarization ratio is no
longer 1 as in the 2D case but around 0.7-0.9 depend-
ing on the case. Finally, the maximum of ρ now occurs
slightly before the resonance at around 368 nm. For the
cases Rand − B and Rand − C, ρ remains quite high, at
least larger than 0.5 beyond the resonance, while it goes
down to around 0.3 for Iso − B.

The overall conclusion of translating the simulation
from 2D to 3D shapes is that the essential qualitative
features are already contained in the 2D simulation. The
quantitative picture will, of course, be diﬀerent. But the
core qualitative (and semi-quantitative) eﬀect of the main
plasmon resonance is already contained in the 2D simu-
lation.

VI. RETARDATION EFFECTS

So far, all the calculations have been performed within
the electrostatics approximation. This is strictly speak-
ing valid for very small objects a ≪ λ, where the electric
ﬁeld can be assumed to be constant over the object. In
practise, retardation eﬀects can become non-negligible
in the visible range for objects of dimensions ≈ 30 nm
(λ/10). Retardation eﬀects tend to red-shift the plas-
mon resonances and add more structure to the resonance
proﬁle. In order to appraise the eﬀect of retardation on
the depolarization ratios, we used Mie theory [22] to cal-
culate exact results for the simple case of 3D spheres.
We follow the treatment of Mie theory given by Bohren
and Huﬀman [23]. For a sphere of radius a, we calcu-
late the exact value of the ﬁeld at the surface ~E(a, θ, φ).
We can then evaluate the relevant integrals to calculate
SERS intensities and depolarization ratios as before. In
particular in the Iso − B case, we calculate:

I⊥2 is a magnitude that cannot be measured when de-
tecting along the excitation direction x, but will be useful
nevertheless to calculate other ratios. The depolarization
ratio is then

ρIso−B =

.

By considering molecules of random orientations, one can
also show that:

The corresponding depolarization ratios ρRand−B and
ρRand−C can then be evaluated.

In Fig. 5 we display the results for the Iso − B case,
for sphere radii in the range a = 1 to a = 60 nm. As
expected, the results for a = 1 nm are identical to those
obtained from the electrostatics approximation. As a
increases, retardation eﬀects lead to a number of modiﬁ-
cations: First the plasmon resonance is split into several
resonances, one of which red-shifts more the larger the ra-
dius. The maximum SERS intensity also decreases as a
increases. Concerning the depolarization ratios, the most
interesting point is that it shows virtually no change be-
yond its original resonance at 368 nm. In particular, the
most red-shifted resonances of the intensity (which are
the ones most relevant to SERS) do not aﬀect ρ. Instead,
ρ is modiﬁed in the regions of the secondary resonances.
A closer look at the data indicates that ρ shows a dip for
each of the resonances in the intensity (except the most
red-shifted one). For example, for a = 30 nm, two dips at
358 and 374 nm are observed for ρ, and they correspond
to peaks in the intensity proﬁle. However, the most red-
shifted resonance (at ∼432 nm) does not aﬀect the proﬁle
of ρ. We conclude that in the regions of interest to SERS,
retardation eﬀects do not in general aﬀect the main con-
clusions on depolarization ratios gained from the simpler
electrostatic approach.

VII. COUPLED RESONANCES - CASE OF A
DIMER

Finally, it is widely believed that the largest SERS en-
hancements originate from interactions between two or
more particles, leading to coupled plasmon resonances.
In many situations, it is likely that the SERS signal origi-
nates mainly from such interactions. We would therefore
like to enquire whether such coupled resonances could
aﬀect our conclusions on the depolarization ratios. To
do so, we calculated the depolarization ratio in the elec-
trostatics approximation for two closely spaced 2D disks
separated by d = 0.1a (where a is the radius). The re-
sults are summarized in Fig. 6. The structure of the
SERS intensity proﬁle in the region of the single plasmon
resonance (from 300 to 380 nm) is very complex. The
coupled plasmon resonance is substantially red-shifted to
440 nm in this case (404 nm for a separation of d = 0.2a,
not shown). This resonance is also the one exhibiting
the highest integrated SERS intensity, as expected. The
complexity of the intensity proﬁle is due to the averaging
of all possible orientations. In the literature, no orienta-
tion averaging is usually considered, hence the intensity

proﬁles exhibit much less structure in general. A wide
variety of depolarization ratios is observed depending of
the assumption made. Some of the discarded models in
this section (like T an − A, T an − B, and T an − C) pre-
dict values for ρ well above 1, a situation not observed
experimentally. The most surprising result of the inclu-
sion of coupled plasmons in dimers is that they seem to
aﬀect only the SERS intensity but not so much ρ, as can
be observed in Fig. 6. When compared to the results
for a single disk (see Fig. 7 for example), coupled reso-
nances appear to narrow the resonance proﬁle of ρ and
make it tend faster towards its limiting long wavelength
value. This leads to a small decrease in ρ for intermediate
wavelengths.

Some of the other models not shown in the ﬁgure like
N orm − B and N orm − C, show a ρ that tends quickly
towards its limiting value of 1/5, which was also predicted
for disks and spheres (2D and 3D) and ellipses (2D). A
value of ρ = 1/5 should therefore be observed in most
SERS conditions if one of these assumptions were correct.
This is not the case, for experiments with a particular
analyte like BTZ2 (used in the experimental section later
on), but could be correct in other cases. We therefore
conclude that the assumptions N orm−B, and N orm−C
for the interaction of the dye with the metal cannot apply
for the speciﬁc analyte we shall explore later.

VIII. SOME EXPERIMENTAL EVIDENCE

We have already ruled out a number of possibilities
and now concentrate on the most likely ones in terms of
a possible connection with experimental results, namely:
Iso− B, Rand− B and Rand− C models. All three cases
show a qualitatively similar behavior, which is summa-
rized in Fig. 7 for the case Rand − C for various model
geometries. We can draw from the previous calculations
a number of conclusions about the depolarization ratios
in these cases:

• In a SERS experiment on colloidal solutions
with non-interacting colloids, where single colloids
would contribute to a substantial fraction of the in-
tensity, one should in principle observe signals from
a distribution of spheroidal colloids, and possibly
some elongated ones. One therefore expects to ob-
serve a ρ of a maximum of about 0.7-0.9. How-
ever, we saw in two instances (2D ellipses, and
3D spheres with retardation), that the maxima
of ρ corresponded to dips in the SERS intensity,
and vice-versa. If the excitation wavelength λL is
within the range of particle resonances, resonant
particles will contribute more to the signal, and a
smaller value for ρ should be observed (we are in
the dip associated with a maximum of SERS inten-
sity). When λL is increased beyond most particles
resonances, ρ should go through a maximum and
eventually decrease slowly towards a limiting value

8

depending on the model chosen. However, this lim-
iting value is very diﬃcult to measure, because the
SERS intensity also decreases substantially.

• In interacting colloid solutions, SERS signals com-
ing from interacting colloids will overwhelm that
coming from single particles. Since the predicted
depolarization ratio of a dimer vary little with
wavelength at the coupled red-shifted resonance
and beyond, one would expect a constant ρ at
long wavelengths. ρ should also increase as λL is
decreased towards the single (uncoupled) plasmon
resonance. Other scenarios could be considered:
for example, because the signal comes from a col-
lection of various interacting objects, some interac-
tions may be more dominant at some wavelengths.
In a simple dimer picture, one expects that as the
wavelength increases, more coupled (and therefore
more red-shifted) resonances are dominating the
signal. A calculation of 2D dimers with diﬀerent
separations shows that increased coupling should
have a negligible eﬀect on ρ. Another possibility is
that the colloids may be able to merge and form
a single elongated particle. Their behavior could
then be more similar to that of an ellipsoidal par-
ticle.

Far from attempting a full experimental study of the
eﬀects reported here for reasons of space, we give an ex-
perimental indication of some of the important aspects
that can be observed experimentally which do support
the idea that depolarization ratios in SERS are aﬀected
by plasmon resonances. Accordingly, we measured de-
polarization ratios of SERS active liquids under various
conditions and at diﬀerent wavelengths.

The experimental details are identical to those re-
ported in Ref. [24], except for the analyte which in these
experiments is the newly developed benzotriazole dye: 4-
(5’-azobenzotriazolyl)naphthalen-1-ylamine (BTZ2)[26].
The samples were prepared by mixing 0.5 mL of silver
colloids[25] with 0.5 mL of water or KCl (concentration
10 mM), and adding 40 µL of 5 µM BTZ2 to obtain an
end concentration of 0.2 µM of dye. The samples were
then diluted by a factor of 4 (in water or KCl) to test for
a possible eﬀect of with multiple scattering on the depo-
larization ratio. No evidence for this were found when
comparing diluted and non-diluted samples. To calcu-
late depolarization ratios, the signals were averaged over
periods between 5 and 20 minutes, to avoid problems
associated with SERS ﬂuctuations. The ratios is then
estimated for 3 consecutive experiments to check for re-
producibility and estimate errors.

These samples are stable for several weeks at room
temperature. There is substantial experimental evidence
of poly-dispersion in such Ag colloidal solution. Figure 8
gives a more deﬁnite idea of the complexity of real col-
loids, like the ones we used in the experiments reported
below, in terms of size and/or shape distribution. The
colloids have an average radius of a = 30 nm and exhibit

an absorption spectrum peaking at 454 nm. Spheres of
a = 30 nm should have a resonance at 430 nm, and the
observed red-shift in absorption is therefore attributed
to variations in the shape of the particles. Without KCl,
there is a strong coulombic repulsion among particles,
and the SERS signal originates from single particle reso-
nances. The addition of KCl results in a screening of this
repulsive force, making the occurrence of closely spaced
pairs more likely either by collisions or direct formation
of dimers or small clusters. This is enough to observe a
large increase in SERS signal, which shows that interact-
ing particles dominate the signal. Such samples remain
however stable with no aggregation into large clusters.

BTZ2 has several Raman peaks, the most prominent
being around 1410 cm−1. We measured the depolariza-
tion of this peak for a high dye concentration in water (no
colloid) with 514 nm excitation and obtained ρ = 0.33,
indicating a uniaxial Raman tensor. The depolarization
ratios for this peak measured under SERS conditions are
summarized in Fig. 9 as a function of laser wavelength,
for samples without KCl (single particles) and with KCl
(interacting particles). It is interesting to note that un-
der SERS conditions, the depolarization ratios of all the
other peaks was nearly the same as this one; a situation
not happening in the pure dye and conﬁrming that ρ is
mainly determined by plasmon resonances rather than
by the Raman tensor of the peaks. The background (or
continuum, a well-known characteristic of SERS) also ex-
hibits the same depolarization ratio, indicating its ori-
gin is strongly related to that of the SERS signal. Our
experimental ﬁndings are consistent with the previous
discussion for this speciﬁc experimental implementation.
The models Rand − C, Rand − B, or Iso − B show a
good qualitative agreement. Rand − C shows the best
quantitative agreement, while Rand − B seem to be pre-
dict too high a depolarization ratio at longer wavelength.
Iso − B is not relevant to this speciﬁc experiments, since
we know from the depolarization ratio measurement in
the pure dye that the tensor is not isotropic, at least when
not adsorbed on the metal. Note the clear presence in
Fig. 9 of a dependence on both the laser excitation and
the KCl concentration, which reveals the role of plasmon
resonances brought about by interactions among colloids.
Both eﬀects are expected from the general considerations
presented in this paper. We discuss brieﬂy the results in
the next section.

We believe that further experiments on depolarization
ratios could prove useful to the general understanding
of SERS. In particular, experiments where parallel and
perpendicular polarization intensities can be monitored
simultaneously would enable one to study the ﬂuctua-
tions of ρ with time. This could provide insight into the
origin of the SERS ﬂuctuations, and a test of their inter-
pretation as coming from single molecules.

IX. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

The rotationally invariant components of the Raman
tensor measured by depolarization ratios have a limited
amount of information about the symmetry of the vibra-
tion. If a new molecule is measured in liquid, of which
no previous information is known, we can infer the sym-
metry of the Raman tensor only to a certain extent. In
general a combination of techniques are required. The
same limitations occur for the changes in depolarization
ratios by the presence of plasmon resonances: there is
only a limited amount of information we can infer about
the orientation of the molecule on the surface and it is
very likely that we cannot decide between two competing
models in certain cases. Like in the original case without
plasmons, a combination of techniques will be needed for
that task.

Still, what this paper has unequivocally shown is that
plasmon resonances produce ”anomalous” depolarization
ratios in standard SERS conditions and that the presence
of the plasmons cannot be neglected or ignored. The key
issue highlighted in this paper can be summarized with
the textbook example of local ﬁelds presented in Fig. 2.
SERS is about local ﬁelds, and the polarization of the lo-
cal ﬁeld does not follow directly from that of the incident
ﬁeld. In that respect, we can safely say that plasmons
are the most important factors controlling the depolariza-
tion of the scattering process under SERS conditions and
are responsible for the large number of anomalies seen in
experiments; a large fraction of which have not been ex-
plained or remain unaccounted for. The experimental
results of the previous section do suggest that both the
excitation wavelength and the state of aggregation of the
colloids (producing coupled plasmon resonances) play a
role in the depolarization ratios that are observed exper-
imentally.

In this respect, we also believe that the interpretation
of depolarization ratios put forward in several previous
publications[18, 19] will probably have to be revised. De-
polarization ratios have been used in the past to infer
something about the orientation of the Raman tensor of
a few (or one) molecules, completely ignoring the fact
that the laser and Stokes ﬁeld couple to the local ﬁeld
through the local plasmons and their symmetries. We
believe that a re-interpretation of the data including the
role of the plasmons might be necessary in those cases.

Finally, the limited amount of experimental informa-
tion we have at the moment seems to to favor model C
with respect to B for the scattering eﬃciency. This is a
longstanding unresolved issue in SERS: whether the en-
hancement operates separately for the laser and Stokes-

ﬁeld thus producing a factor of ∝
in the scattering
eﬃciency, or whether it is only the enhancement at the

laser frequency ∝
followed by a re-emission process.
Far from resolving this issue here, we suggest that de-
polarization ratios could help to discard possibilities and

FIG. 1: Depolarization ratios and total SERS intensities cal-
culated for a 2D disk from diﬀerent assumptions as a function
of wavelength. T an, N orm, Iso and Rand deﬁne the type of
Raman tensor under consideration, as speciﬁed in the text
(Sec. II), while A, B, and C account for the diﬀerent models
of the scattering process deﬁned in Eqs.
(1), (2), and (3).
Note that the SERS enhancements are plotted on a log-scale.

Intensity patterns in a 2D disk at three diﬀerent
FIG. 2:
wavelengths (columns) for the ﬁeld component along z (ﬁrst
row), y (second row), and for the total intensity (third row).
The excitation polarization of the external ﬁeld is along z. For
a scatterer with an isotropic Raman tensor, for example, the
2
integrated intensity on the surface of the disk for |Ey|
divided
2
by that for |Ez|
deﬁnes the depolarization ratio ρ. By visual
inspection, it is evident that the depolarization ratio will be
smaller at 312 and 364 nm than at 339 nm, where the disk has
its main resonance. Colors mean diﬀerent intensities for the
diﬀerent columns; we provide the maximum ﬁeld intensity for
each wavelength at the top of each column. Red (blue) means
high (low) intensity in a linear color scale. See the text for
further details.

FIG. 3: Depolarization ratios (top) and total SERS intensities
(bottom) as a function of wavelength calculated for an ellipse
for some of the models presented in Fig. 1. As opposed to the
case of a disk in Fig. 1, an ellipse has two main shape-related
plasmon resonances in the SERS intensity proﬁle. The T an −
B model for the orientation of the molecule and the scattering
mechanism gives depolarization ratios which go well above 1
across the visible range.

FIG. 4: Comparison between the depolarization ratios (top)
and the total SERS intensities (bottom) calculated for a 3D
sphere with those of a 2D disk. The curves with symbols
(lines) are the 3D (2D) cases for models Iso − B, Rand − B,
and Rand − C, respectively. The depolarization ratios to-
gether with the SERS intensities in this ﬁgure complete the
qualitative/quantitative comparison of the eﬀect of dimen-
sionality on these quantities.

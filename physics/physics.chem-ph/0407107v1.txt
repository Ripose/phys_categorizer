Abstract

One-particle Schr¨odinger equations are considered, e.g., the Hartree–Fock equations, that contain

a nonlocal operator, e.g., the Hartree–Fock exchange operator, where this operator depends on the

one-particle density-matrix of a determinantal state. One-body nonlocal operators of this type

are converted into local potentials that depend on the kernel of the nonlocal operator and, also,

the one-particle density matrix that, as mentioned above, the nonlocal operator also depends

on. The derived local potentials appear to yields a sort of average for matrix elements involving

(exclusively) occupied orbitals. The important oﬀ-diagonal matrix elements involving an occupied

and an unoccupied orbitals – where these matrix elements uniquely determine the one-particle

density matrix – may actually have the local operator yielding identical results with the nonlocal

one or, perhaps, give a reasonable approximation. However, calculations or further theoretical

considerations are required in order to test this hypothesis. In addition, the Xα exchange potential

derived by Slater with the original prescription of α as unity is derived by considering a uniform

electron gas.

INTRODUCTION

There is a considerable interest in the conversion of nonlocal, one-body operators into

local, multiplicative operators, or potentials. For example, using a local, multiplicative

operator to replace a nonlocal one can lead to signiﬁcant computational savings when solving

the Hartree–Fock equations, or other similar one-body, coupled equations. In addition, the

Kohn-Sham approach of density functional theory (DFT) [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] requires the

noninteracting state to be obtained from a local potential, since this formalism invokes

the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem [8], even though, according to the adiabatic connection, the

exact exchange energy is the same one-particle density-matrix functional as the one from

Hartree–Fock theory [9, 10, 11, 12, 13], except that the one-particle functions are Kohn–

Sham orbitals.

Other possible applications of nonlocal to local conversions is for one-particle density-

matrix approaches that employ a nonlocal operator [14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]. For example,

in the reference-state one-particle density-matrix formalism [20, 21], the conversion of the

nonlocal exchange-correlation potential into a local operator leads naturally to a density

functional theory, since the one-particle density matrix of the determinantal reference state

obtained from a local potential is a unique functional of its electron density, according to

the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem.

A classical example of the conversion of a nonlocal operators into local one is Slater’s local

exchange-operator, derived from a uniform electron gas [22]. A very similar approximate

functional has also been derived by Gasper [23], where this one only diﬀers by a constant

from the one derived by Slater. The Xα approach [24] includes a semiempirical parameter
that yields Slater’s original prescription with α = 1, and the one by Gasper for α = 2
3.

Gasper’s exchange operator is also used within the local density approximation (LDA) of

DFT [1, 2, 3]. When the Gasper potential is combined with Becke’s exchange correction

[25], derived in 1988, a very accurate approximation is obtained, and this two component

exchange potential is used within the very successful DFT hybrid approach known as the

B3LYP method [26, 27].

The optimized eﬀective potential approach [28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33] is a method to convert

a nonlocal operator into a local potential. This approach, unfortunately, often leads to

rather complicated functionals that depend on the individual orbitals. Below we introduce

2

a diﬀerent approach that converts one-body nonlocal operators into local potentials that

depend on the kernel of the nonlocal operator and, also, the one-particle density matrix

that the nonlocal operator also depends on. No test calculations are performed. However,

the approach yields Slater’s original prescription of α = 1 when a uniform electron gas is

considered.

II. THE CLOSED-SHELL RESTRICTED SPIN-ORBITAL FORMALISM

Consider a set of spatially restricted spin-orbitals [34]:

ψiσ(r1, ω) = χi(r1)σ(ω1), σ = α, β,

where the spin and spatial coordinates are given by r1 and ω1, respectively. Consider also

the following spinless, one-particle Schr¨odinger equation:

where this Hermitian one-body operator is given by

ˆFρ1χi(r1) = ǫiχi(r1),

ˆFρ1 = −

∇2 + vρ1 + ˆwρ1,

1
2

and vρ1 and ˆwρ1 are local and nonlocal operators, respectively; these operators depend on

the spinless one-particle density matrix ρ1 of a closed shell single-determinantal state, say

|Φi; that is, we have [3, 21, 35]

ρ1(r1, r2) = 2

χw(r1)χ∗

w(r2),

Xw

where the same spatial-orbitals appearing in this summation are doubly occupied within

|Φi; henceforth, w, x denote these occupied orbitals from |Φi; r, s denote the unoccupied

Now consider the possibility of replacing the nonlocal operator ˆwρ1 by a local one, say zρ1;

orbitals.

so, we have

zρ1(r1)χx(r1) =

dr2 wρ1(r1, r2)χx(r2),

Z

where wρ1(r1, r2) is the kernel of ˆwρ1.

(1)

(5)

Our interest here is in the one-particle density-matrix ρ1 that arises from solving Eq. (2).

Therefore, we only consider the operator ˆwρ1 acting upon an occupied orbital, ˆwρ1χx in the

above equation. In other words, ρ1 does not depend on ˆwρ1χr, where χr is an excited orbital.

We do, however, require ˆwρ1 to be Hermitian.
Multiplying the previous equation by χ∗

x(r3) and summing over the orbital indices gives

(6)

(7)

(8)

zρ1(r1)ρ1(r1, r3) =

dr2 wρ1(r1, r2)ρ1(r2, r3).

Setting r3 = r1 yields the desired result:

zρ1(r1) ≈ ρ−1(r1)

dr2 wρ1(r1, r2)ρ1(r2, r1),

Z

Z

where ρ(r) is the electron density, ρ1(r, r). For example, the exact exchange operator from

Hartree–Fock theory yields,

vx
ρ1(r1) ≈ −

ρ−1(r1)

dr2 r−1

12 |ρ1(r1, r2)|2,

1
2

Z

where the kernel of the exchange operator is − 1

2 r−1

12 ρ1(r1, r2).

In the two previous expressions above we have changed the equality to an approximation,

since these are apparently not identities, where this conclusion arises, in part, since, in our

derivation of Eq. (6) we have summed over all occupied orbitals. Now if Eq. (5) is valid,

of course, Eqs. (6) and (7) must be satisﬁed, but, perhaps, not vice versa. So if we deﬁne

zρ1 by Eq. (7) there is no guarantee that we will also satisfy Eq. (5). For example, consider

a simple case of only two occupied orbitals, say χw and χx, where instead of Eq. (5) being

satisﬁed, we have the following relations:

zρ1(r1)χx(r1) =

dr2 wρ1(r1, r2)χx(r2) + χ∗

y(r1)φ(r1),

zρ1(r1)χy(r1) =

dr2 wρ1(r1, r2)χy(r2) − χ∗

x(r1)φ(r1),

Z

Z

(9a)

(9b)

where φ(r3) is an arbitrary function. Multiplying the ﬁrst equation by χx(r3)∗ and the
second one by χy(r3)∗ removes the last terms from both equations when the two equations

are added, yielding Eq. (6).

As in any operator, our operators are completely deﬁned by their matrix elements. If the

4

following identities are satisﬁed, then the local and nonlocal operators are equivalent:

dr1 χy(r1)zρ1(r1)χx(r1) =

dr1

dr2 χy(r1)wρ1(r1, r2)χx(r2),

dr1 χr(r1)zρ1(r1)χx(r1) =

dr1

dr2 χr(r1)wρ1(r1, r2)χx(r2),

dr1 χr(r1)zρ1(r1)χs(r1) =

dr1

dr2 χr(r1)wρ1(r1, r2)χs(r2),

Z

and we can replace the one-body operator, given by Eq. (3), by the following:

ˆFρ1 = −

∇2 + vρ1 + zρ1.

2

(10a)

(10b)

(10c)

(11)

However, for our purposes, we do not need all three relations given by Eqs. (10) to be

satisﬁed. In particular, if Eq. (10c) is not satisﬁed, Eq. (2) is still satisﬁed for the same

occupied orbitals and, as mentioned previously, the one-particle density-matrix ρ1 is not

changed. Furthermore, if Eq. (10a) is not satisﬁed, we will get diﬀerent occupied orbitals

but they will diﬀer only by a unitary transformation as long as Eq. (10b) remains valid, and,

again, the one-particle density-matrix ρ1 is not changed. Hence, we only need Eq. (10b) to

be satisﬁed. So it is possible, that the approximation given by Eq. (7) can yield the correct

ρ1 and a set of occupied orbitals that diﬀer only by a unitary transformation.

In that case, for example, the last terms in Eqs. (9) have no components in the orthogonal

space; they satisfy the following:

dr1 χ∗

r(r1)χ∗

x(r1)φ(r1) =

dr1 χ∗

r(r1)χ∗

y(r1)φ(r1) = 0,

(12)

Z

Z

for any unoccupied orbital χr. Therefore, if one can proves that φ(r1) is a constant, and

generalize this result for any number of occupied orbitals, the occupied orbitals obtained

from the local operator will only diﬀer by a unitary transformation from the ones obtained

from the nonlocal operator, and, it appears from Eq. (7) that the local potentials is a sort

of average of the nonlocal operator within the occupied block of the Fock space.

III. THE OPEN-SHELL UNRESTRICTED SPIN-ORBITAL FORMALISM

We now generalize the previous derivation to the case where the determinantal state is

composed of orbitals that are spatially unrestricted; that is, we have [34]

ψiσ(x1) = χiσ(r1)σ(ω), σ = α, β,

(13)

5

where the spatial r1 and spin coordinates ω1 are denoted collectively by x1; furthermore, we

have a diﬀerent one-body operator for each spin-function:

where the Hermitian one-body operators are given by

ˆF σ

γ χiσ(r1) = ǫiσχiσ(r1),

ˆF σ

γ = −

∇2 + vσ

γ + ˆwσ
γ ,

1
2

and vσ

γ and ˆwσ

γ are local and nonlocal operators, respectively; these operators depend on the

one-particle density matrix γ of the single-determinantal state |Φi; that is, we have

where

γ(x1, x2) = γ(r1, ω1; x2, ω1)δω1ω2,

γ(r1, ω; x2, ω) =

|σ(ω)|2ρ1σ(r1, r2),

and for Nσ occupied σ orbital, the spin-components of γ are given by

ρ1σ(r1, r2) =

χwσ(r1)χ∗

wσ(r2).

Our one-body operators ˆF σ

γ , and potential, vσ
explicit functional of its components, ρ1α and ρ1β; furthermore, we require ˆF σ

γ and ˆwσ

γ , depend upon γ. However, γ is an

γ not to depend

on the spin variable ω, since this dependence is easily removed. So, we could, instead write,
for example, ˆF σ

ρ1α,ρ1β . However, for a less cluttered notation, we will continue to indicate a

γ dependence. This is also not inaccurate, since if we know γ, we also know ρ1α and ρ1β.

Now, as in Eq. (5), consider the possibility of replacing the nonlocal operator ˆwσ

γ by a

local one, say zσ
γ :

zσ
γ (r1)χxσ(r1) =

dr2 wσ

γ (r1, r2)χxσ(r2),

where wσ

γ (r1, r2) is the kernel of ˆwσ

γ . Multiplying the this equation by χ∗

xσ(r3) and summing

over the orbital indices gives

zσ
γ (r1)ρ1σ(r1, r3) =

dr2 wσ

γ (r1, r2)ρ1σ(r2, r3).

where ρσ(r) is the σ-component of the electron density, given by ρ1σ(r, r). For example, the

where the kernel of the exchange operator is −r−1

IV. THE Xα EXCHANGE POTENTIAL

It is well known that the spinless, one-particle density matrix ρ1(r1, r2) of a closed-shell

uniﬁed electron-gas depends on its density ρ, a constant. A generalized expression for ρ1 is

obtained by replacing the constant density with a non-constant one, say ρ(r) [3]:

ρ1(r1, r2) = ρ1(r, s) = 3ρ(r)

sin [kf (r)s] − kf (r)s cos [kf (r)s]
[kf (r)s]3

,

where

(29)

where in the derivation by Parr and Yang [3], the integration is expressed using the r and s

coordinates and the integration is carried out over s. Analogous expressions for unrestricted

orbitals and open shell systems are also readily derived [3, 6].

In the Kohn-Sham LDA [1, 3, 6], the functional derivative of the above exchange func-

tional gives the following local exchange potential:

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

(30)

in agreement with Gasper’s potential [23]. However, it well known that this functional diﬀers
from the one obtained by Slater [22] by a factor of 2

x(r) is obtained directly from

3, where vρ

the Hartree-Fock, nonlocal, exchange-operator and, in addition, Slater’s approach uses a

sort of averaging over the occupied orbital states.

We now demonstrate that the Xα exchange potential, with original prescription of α = 1,

arises in our approach when considering a uniform electron gas, where we only consider the

closed-shell spin restricted formalism, and the derivation in analogous to the one by Parr

and Yang mentioned above. In our derivation, we also use Eq. (23) except that, at least for

the moment, we leave the density as a constant:

ρ1(r1, r2) = 3ρ

1
f s3 (sin(kf s) − kf s cos(kf s)) .

(32)

Now as far as the integral is concerned, x1, y1, are z1 are constants. Therefore, by making

the following substitution:

sx = (x2 − x1)

(33)

as well as analogous ones for sy and sz, where, for example (dsx = dx2), we get

and since the integral is 1

where we have introduced a diﬀerent notation for the exchange potential, since it is simply

a constant that depends on ρ. Using Eq. (24), we obtain the following expression after some

algebra and by replacing ρ by a non-constant density, ρ(r):

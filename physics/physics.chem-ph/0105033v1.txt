Abstract

We present an analytic ansatz to ﬁnd the eﬀective electrostatic potential and

Coulomb correlations in multicenter problems, speciﬁcally homogeneous and

doped clusters of metal atoms. The approach is based on a quasi-classical

density-functional treatment. We focus on the interpretive aspect of our

ﬁndings, particularly on extracting insight regarding the geometric eﬀects

of Coulomb correlations for any given spatial disposition of ionic cores. For

singly-doped metallic clusters we obtain a direct visualization of the varia-

tions of both screening and Coulomb correlations with changes of location of

the dopant atom. This analysis provides a way to interpret recent observa-

tions of the variability of physical properties of metal clusters with changes

of composition and geometry.

Collective eﬀects induced by Coulomb correlations in atoms have been studied in two

ways. In the ﬁrst, both hydrodynamic theory and local approximate dielectric theory have

been used; neither of these takes into account either shell structure or the single-particle

spectrum of the valence electrons. [1] These methods are capable, at most, of giving gross

trends in dynamical properties. The second route instead uses a fully quantal description

based on the one-electron excitation spectrum and corresponding wavefunctions. A recent

collection of papers provides a description of methods and results of the application of

many-body techniques in atomic theory. [2]

The way electrons are correlated can be inferred from the probability distribution implied

by their wavefunction. To make it possible to make such inferences, however, we must be

a bit thoughtful about how we present this distribution. Even for a two-electron atom, we

begin with a function of six independent variables in a ﬁxed center-of-mass system. We would

like to extract from this a description in no more than two or three independent variables,

something we can represent pictorially and visualize. For a three-body system such as He∗∗

or the valence electrons of Mg, a natural and practical way to carry out such a description

has emerged as an analytic reduction of the probability density

Ψ (r1, r2)

to the joint

|

|

probability density p (r1, r2, θ12), where θ12 is the angle between the position vectors r1 and

r2 of two electrons. [3,4] This in turn makes it straightforward to compute and display the

conditional probability density d (r2, θ12; r1), for ﬁnding one of the two electrons at distance

r1 from the nucleus, and at an angle θ12 from the vector from the nucleus to electron 2 if

electron 2 is at a distance r2 from the nucleus. Three-dimensional graphs of d (r1, r2, θ12)

provide a vivid and precise way to depict the correlation of two electrons. [5] With this

probability density d, one can compare wave functions of diﬀerent qualities, see what roles

long-range and short range correlation play in various states, exhibit the relative importance

of angular and radial correlation, and compare correlation in diﬀerent atomic systems. The

work, started in the late 1970s by Rehmus, Kellman, Roothaan and Berry [3,4], provides a

generalization of other quantitative descriptions of electron correlation. [6–14]

For the system of more particles, we have yet to ﬁnd a comparably powerful approach

2

because so much information is contained in the wave function and we do not know how to

extract what is relevant in a manner adaptable to pictures. An exception emerges, obviously,

for the high-density limit of the Fermi ﬂuid where a collective description of electrons is

likely to be optimal. This collective description is based on the organized behavior of the

electrons brought about by their long-range Coulomb interactions. The long-range Coulomb

interactions, subject to the screening among the electric charges, act to couple together the

motion of many electrons, giving rise to the well-known quantum density oscillations. [15]

Working toward extracting insights from the probability density

of the quasi-classical description for the (valence) electron gas, we develop here an analyt-

ical ansatz which allows us to ﬁnd and visualize the eﬀective electrostatic potential and

Coulomb correlations in multicenter problems. We apply this ansatz to the case of mod-

erately large metallic clusters. To anticipate what follows, let us state our ﬁndings: by

using a generalized partition function for valence electrons (the Bloch density matrix), the

electron self-distribution in the common potential V (r) is derived in terms of many-body

perturbation theory. [16] This approach produces the electron density ρ (r) as a functional

of V (r) (with ρ (r)

V (r)), which is valid for describing metallic systems, i.e. systems

∼

with a high-density valence electron gas. Further, inside the electron gas of density ρ (r),

we introduce the cluster cage formed by the positive ion cores with the spatial distribution

given by ρ+ (Ri), and apply Poisson’s equation to the cluster as a whole. (The vectors Ri

are position vectors of the ions.) The self-consistent solution of this equation gives the col-

lective description of the cluster constituents, electrons plus ions. This generalization of the

Coulomb interaction results in a superposition of quantum oscillations given by long-range

contributions and screening on the smooth ”semiclassical” potential [17]. We focus on their

interpretive aspects and speciﬁcally on extracting insights regarding the geometric eﬀects

of Coulomb correlations for any given spatial disposition of ionic cores. Also, we explore

the case of a foreign metal atom doping a otherwise-homogeneous cluster of metal atoms.

The approach presented here provides us with a direct visualization of the way both the

screening eﬀect and the Coulomb correlations change with changes of the location of the

3

impurity. This analysis is important in the context of recent observations of the role played

by composition and geometry in changing the physical properties of metallic clusters [18–20].

Consider a ﬁxed positive ion distribution in space ρ+ (Ri), with Ri the positions of the

ions measured from the center of the cluster. The ion cluster cage has a net charge measured

in appropriate units equal to zN, where z is the electric charge of one ion (for simplicity, we

shall restrict the discussion to single-valent metals, z = 1) and N denotes the total number

of ions in the cluster. If a gas of valence electrons carrying an equal number of negative

charges is introduced, so that the system is strictly neutral, then the electrons redistribute

themselves so as to shield the positive charges at large distances and minimize the Coulomb

self-energy of that gas, and also satisfy the Fermion constraints on the electrons.

In the

high density limit of the Fermi ﬂuid, Bohr’s Correspondence Principle applies and we can

introduce the collective description of the electron gas based on the methods of statistical

mechanics. The generalized partition function of the valence electrons moving in the common

potential V (r) can be written in terms of the wave functions Ψi (r) and energy levels εi as

Γ (r′, r,β) =

Ψ∗

i (r′) Ψi (r) e−εiβ ,

Xi

where β = (kBT )

−1, kB is Boltzmann’s constant and T the absolute temperature. By
integrating this along the diagonal, where r′ = r, we obtain the ordinary partition function

of statistical mechanics. Eq. (1) is the Bloch density matrix and if we operate with the

one-particle Hamiltonian

on Γ, and compare the result with that obtained by diﬀerentiating Γ with respect to β, then

we ﬁnd the Bloch equation

which has the form of the time-dependent Schr¨odinger eq., with β playing the role of it.

The boundary condition required to deﬁne the solution of (3) follows from the completeness

theorem for eigenfunctions, namely

In the high density limit, the behavior of the electrons is simple, and the Coulomb interaction

can be treated as a perturbation of the motion of the free electrons. Therefore the solution

of eq. (3) may be written as

where Γ0 is the Bloch density matrix for an assembly of free electrons. The derivation of

Dirac’s density matrix γ (r′, r) from (4) is described in Ref. [16]. It consists of an iterative

procedure to ﬁnd the perturbation terms in Γ. The ﬁrst step is replacement of Γ0 for Γ in

the integral and integration over β′. If the Bloch density matrix Γ is determined, Dirac’s

density matrix γ (which is actually the electron density) may be obtained by using the

Laplace transform relation connecting Γ (r′, r,β) and γ (r′, r,ξ)

ﬁrst-order spherical Bessel function.

With the primary form (5) , the electron density ρ (r) makes further mathematical com-

putations very diﬃcult. To go further, we need to simplify by linearizing. Usually, this

linearization proceeds by adding the assumption that V (r) varies slowly in space, the

Thomas-Fermi approximation. Accordingly, V (r′) is replaced in (5) by V (r) [21]. One

obvious point needs to be stressed here: the discrete positive ion distribution used here

produces a Coulomb potential with a far more rapid spatial variation than that of the

5

frequently-invoked continuum distribution of the ”jellium” models [22]. The linearization in

(5) can still be made under the following assumptions. Our main observation at the outset is

that in a high-density electron gas, any electric charge is screened out very rapidly, namely,

at distances beyond a characteristic Debye screening length, say q−1
0

(which is inversely pro-

portional to √kF , as can be seen below). Also, we notice that the slow variation of V (r) is

usually supposed to be over a de Broglie wavelength for an electron at the Fermi surface,

that is 2π/kF . From this view, we may say that a possible conﬂict with the use of the

Thomas-Fermi approximation occurs only close to the positive ions, closer than a shielding

distance q−1

0 . Disregarding this limitation, we use the Thomas-Fermi approximation in (5)

to obtain, after a straightforward integration,

ρ (r) = ρ0

(6)

where q2

πaH , with aH the Bohr radius. The results are not strongly aﬀected by this

approximation. For example, good agreement within natural limits has been obtained pre-

viously [23] for the fullerene molecule described in this way and without the simplifying

linearization. At the same time, we can see that the density follows the potential closely,

which means that the validity of the theory is ensured, as we already stipulated above, by an

appropriate requirement on the electron density. Of course this theoretical model loses its

validity at large distances from the ion locations because the electron density vanishes, and

at very short distances, towards the center of the cluster cage, where the density becomes

inﬁnite with the potential [24].

Eq. (6) is a quasi-classical result obtained in the high density approximation for the

valence electrons. Within the quasi-classical approximation, [25] local variations of the

electron density leave the exchange contribution unchanged, as a consequence of its nonlocal

(quantum) character. Therefore, a ﬁrst-order quantum correction to this quasi-classical

result represents the exchange energy

Consequently, we may assume that the common potential V (r) is generated only by the

electron distribution in the presence of the discrete ionic background. We may therefore set

We have to solve a self-consistent ﬁeld problem which accounts for the electron distribution

proﬁle in the presence of a discrete positive background. The last term on the right side of

eq.(7) represents the density of positive charge with Ri the average distance of an ion from

the center of the cluster and i is an index running over the ions, each with electric charge

zi. These locations are chosen without regard to the stability of the conﬁguration.

The former equation (9) (subject to appropriate boundary conditions, as we will see

below) deals with the eﬀective Coulomb potential due to the electron distribution in the

super-sphere of eﬀective radius R. To solve it we exploit the fact that (9) separates in

spherical polar coordinates r, θ, ϕ. The solution of Poisson’s equation (9) is given by

where g (θ, ϕ) is an arbitrary function. Here, g represents a ”pseudo-charge density” designed

to be a smooth, nodeless function which, in order to maintain the electrical neutrality of the

entire system, has to agree exactly with the true charge density outside the region bounded

by the super-sphere of radius R.

9

An additional comment is appropriate here regarding the present theory. We begin by

asking,“How unique is the potential in eqs. (18) and (19)?” If we demand that our ”pseudo-

charge density” g agrees with the true charge density outside the ”super-sphere” then the

potential is uniquely determined. The inside region is not uniquely ﬁxed by this procedure;

however, if we require that the total charge of the valence electrons be normalized, then the

fraction of electronic charge contained in this region must be large, e.g., more than

95%

∼

of the total. This means that the behavior of the charge contained in this region must

dominate the static properties of the metallic cluster.

The eﬀective cluster potential given by (18) displays the usual collective aspects of the

electron gas. The primary manifestations of the collective behavior are a) collective oscil-

lations of the valence electrons as an entity, the so-called ”plasma” oscillations, and b) the

screening of the ﬁeld of any individual electric charge beyond a characteristic length q−1
0 .

The former is fundamentally a diﬀraction eﬀect, the electron wave nature being essentially

disregarded in this kind of calculation. The screening of the ionic ﬁelds causes the remainder

of the electron gas to stay diﬀuse, and so leads to a deﬁciency of negative charge just out-

side the immediate neighborhood of each positive ion enclosed in its neutralizing, co-moving

electronic cloud. Thus, the cluster potential exhibits additional spatial oscillations which

are not determined solely by its behavior in the neighborhood of r. In a collective oscil-

lation, each individual electron suﬀers a small periodic perturbation of its velocity (recall

that the electron density (5) is a result of the perturbation of the kinetic operator) and

position due to the combined potential of all the other particles, both positive and negative.

The cumulative potential of all the electrons may be quite large since the long range of the

Coulomb interaction permits all the electrons to contribute to the potential at every point.

The collective behavior of the electron gas dominates phenomena involving distances greater

than the characteristic length q−1

0 , while the individual particle component is associated with

the random thermal motion of the electrons. In the approximate level of this analysis, the

eﬀects of collective excitation on the correlation are neglected, as a second-order eﬀect.

Usually, the long range of the Coulomb interactions having the character of (18) precludes

10

immediate application of these results to the calculation of the ground-state energy of the

cluster. Therefore, we are not able to perform a minimization of the ground-state energy

with respect to the volume of the super-sphere. Consequently, the self-consistency of the

potential is aﬀected by this lack of information.

With all the assumptions of the model and its mathematical output now presented,

we may already point out some general characteristics we may expect for the behavior of

the eﬀective cluster potential. Since in the present perturbation approach the expansion

of the electron density is based on plane waves, the cluster potential displays a high value

in the central region. The potential is strongly dependent on the Coulomb correlations

and, naturally enough, very sensitive to the position of the positive ions. (We discuss this

aspect later.) Nonlocal eﬀects due to the particle spins in the mean ﬁeld for electrons are

disregarded. Hence the method produces state-independent potentials.

In the following discussion, we work out an example of a metallic cluster M13 with

icosahedral symmetry that closely approximates spherical symmetry. The model for the

ionic cores is that of hard-spheres occupying a total volume in space equal to Ωions. The

valence electrons are highly conﬁned between the ionic cores. The unperturbed density ρ0

is expressed by

ρ0 =

3
4πrs

=

4π
3 R3

Ωions

,

N

−

(22)

where rs is a point in the space available to the electrons, the “electronic interspace”, outside

the ion cores. This means that we have subtracted from the entire volume of the super-

sphere of radius R the volume assigned to the ionic cores Ωions; N is the total number of

the delocalized electrons, equal to the number of ionic charges. The distance between the

centers of the central and outer ions is the bond length. For numerical calculation we set

Ri = 5.9 a.u.. The core volume Ωions is usually computed by taking into account the ionic

radius; In our ﬁrst example, we let this radius be 2.74a.u. so the resulting volume Ωions

is 1122(a.u.)3. For the other two cases, this volume is a free parameter. The electronic

interspace was chosen to be rs = 0.75 a.u., in accordance with the high-density electron

11

gas requirement (rs ≪
the super-sphere, the super-sphere radius becomes R = 6.5 a.u. In Fig. 1 we can see the

1), and by imposing that 95% of the total electrons must be inside

corresponding eﬀective potential inside the super-sphere as a function of r and θ. In Fig.

2, the spatial dependence of the same potential is displayed along the coordinates θ and

φ at the radius where the outer ions lie, Ri = 5.9 a.u.. These pictures show the regular,

collective characteristics we discussed above. The oscillations we observe are a manifestation

of the self-consistency of Poisson’s equation and represents the main correlation eﬀect of the

electron gas in the metallic state (the high-density limit).

Despite the collective aspects which contribute to the mean-ﬁeld character of the eﬀective

potential, V (r) remains sensitive to the geometry and composition of the cluster. If, for

example, one host atom in the cluster cage is replaced by an impurity atom A, the potential

reﬂects this structural change. We explore this property in the following. Let us assume that

the impurity A is a trivalent metal atom (A) which releases all three of its valence electrons

into the Fermi sea in the bulk volume. We take its core volume to be the same as the M

ions. The substitution does not change the symmetry and we assume that the most stable

geometry of the cluster has the dopant at the centre. Figs. 3 and 4 show the corresponding

eﬀective electrostatic potential for the AM12 system. By comparing this with the eﬀective

mean-ﬁeld potential for M13, we observe that the presence of the trivalent atom at the

center makes the potential much deeper. (See Fig. 3, where V is displayed as a function of

r and θ .). The delocalized electrons polarize inward, toward the high Coulomb ﬁeld of the

central, trivalent ion. Fig. 4 shows also that the shape of the quantum oscillations at the

cluster surface changes relative to the previous case. The amplitudes of oscillations become

rather uniform which means that the screening among the electric charges is much better

for this system than for the homogeneous cluster, a consequence of the increased number

of delocalized electrons, from 13 to 15. Moreover the better screening eﬀect here results in

a change in the eﬀective force acting in the electron gas. This can be seen in Fig. 4 as a

phase-shift of electron density oscillations at the position of the positive ions. (Compare

this with the eﬀective potential displayed in Fig. 2.)

12

If we move the trivalent ion to the outer shell, the disturbance of course goes toward

the surface (see Fig. 5) and the electron density is enhanced around the vertex where

the trivalent ion is located. This behavior of the eﬀective potential is supplemented by

the appearance of more pronounced Coulombic correlations of the valence electrons near the

surface. The quantum oscillations are sensibly disturbed by the trivalent impurity located on

the cluster surface. This disturbance appears as irregular behavior along the θ coordinate at

constant r. Also, a large potential diﬀerence, about 1 a.u., can be seen in Fig. 6 between the

position of the trivalent impurity (θ = 0, ϕ = 0) and the antipodal position (θ = π, ϕ = 0)

occupied by a host ion. The potential diﬀerence leads to a displacement of the electronic

cloud towards the position of the trivalent ion and a deﬁciency of negative charge in the

opposite direction. Consequently, a diﬀusive trend of electron density oscillations can be

observed in the hemisphere at θ = π.

We may conclude that the eﬀective electrostatic potentials for metallic clusters is subject

to important Coulombic correlation eﬀects which can be visualized at the proper scale by

employing a discrete description for the positive background. The electron density shows

a static screening which is rather localized near the positive charges and supplemented by

the long-range oscillatory behavior. For singly-doped binary metallic systems, the depth of

the eﬀective electrostatic potential depends on the dopant position in the cluster geometry.

The collective aspects of the excitations of electrons delocalized through the cluster volume

are strongly perturbed by the presence of the impurity. The main eﬀect of these structural

rearrangements of the ions is the change of the eﬀective potential, as we have shown. The

change of the cluster potential will alter, in turn, the ordering of the related electron shell,

a fact which has been observed in many experiments [18–20]. Therefore our ﬁndings may

be interpreted as qualitative support for various models explaining the shell inversions for

doped metallic clusters [27–30]. Obviously other kinds of changes of dopant atoms may

induce still diﬀerent eﬀects, that will depend on their locations in the cluster.

Finally, we may say that the method developed here is simple and ﬂexible and can

yield, to some extent, accurate approximations to the exact eﬀective potentials with minor

13

computing eﬀort. Also, it has the advantage of physical immediacy, i.e., the present approach

is easy to interpret. This makes the method useful for a fast check of the eﬀective potential

to systems, clusters of heavy elements, for example, presently beyond the capability of more

accurate approaches.

[17] ”Semiclassical” denotes here the situation with suﬃciently slowly varying potential. It is

worth-while mentioning here that a similar method was ﬁrst applied by Kohn and Sham

to describe a system of electrons subject to a very slowly varying external potential (W.

Kohn and L.J. Sham, Phys. Rev. 137 1697 (1965)).

[21] This makes the connection between March’s theory of perturbed electron density [N.H.

March and A.M. Murray, Phys. Rev. 120 830 (1960)] and Mott’s treatment of imper-

fections in metals [N.F. Mott, Proc. Cambridge Phil. Soc. 32 281 (1936)].

[24] To remove this qualitative defect, we should work with the electron density within

primary form (5), which remains ﬁnite at the origin for a potential which is singular

as r−1. Further employment of eq (6) for the electron density has the advantage of

producing an analytical result for the eﬀective cluster potential.

[25] There exists a limit within which we can regard the Fermi ﬂuid as a high density gas.

Accordingly, the electron wave vector must be larger than kc ∼
the Fermi wave vector. The above result was obtained by a minimizing procedure of the

0.68 kF ,where kF is

16

lowest state energy (see, D. Pines Phys. Rev. 92 626 (1953); D. Bohm and D. Pines,

Phys. Rev. 92 609 (1953)) . According to the above criterion, the region of high kinetic

energy of the electron (and therefore, rapidly varying wave functions) is consistent with

the high density approximation.

Given for one instant an intelligence which could comporehend all the forces

by which nature is animated and the respective situation of the beings who com-

pose it–an intelligence suﬃciently vast to submit these data to analysis–it would

embrace in the same formula the movements of the greatest bodies of the universe

and those of the lightest atom; for it, nothing would be uncertain and the future,

as the past, would be present to its eyes.–Laplace.

I. INTRODUCTION

Simulating chemical reactions in the condensed phase involves the parallel computation

of the concerted quantum dynamics of breaking and formation of chemical bonds with

the simultaneous response and inﬂuence of the surrounding media. In many systems it is

not entirely possible to treat all of the motions quantum mechanically without resorting

to various levels of approximation. One approach which has proven to be quite powerful

in a wide range of scenarios is to partition the full system into interacting subsystems

according to whether the dynamics in the subsystem is predominantly classical-like or if

the dynamics must necessarily be treated quantum mechanically. Such partitionings are

motivated by the simple observation that quantum mechanical eﬀects are typically localized

to only a few speciﬁc types of motions typically along some chosen reaction coordinate.

The remaining motions, i.e. those of the surrounding media, can largely be regarded as

classical. Thus, partitioning the extended system into interacting quantum and classical

subsystems allows one to study the details of a condensed phase quantum phenomena while

retaining a detailed description of the response and inﬂuence of a complicated molecular

media in its full dimensionality. Consequently, the level of description aﬀorded by mixed

1

quantum/classical treatments and the relative computational eﬃciency of the method has

allowed a synergistic interaction between theory and experiment since experiments can be use

to validate theoretical models which in turn have provided a number of valuable mechanistic

insights.

Current quantum chemical methods have proven to be quite adequate in providing struc-

tural and dynamical information for radicals in the gas phase and inert matrices. In these

circumstances, quantum computations have provided a direct link between experimental

spectroscopic investigations limited chieﬂy by the level of sophistication needed to obtain

accurate structures, spin dependent properties such as hyperﬁne interactions, and higher

order propertied such as hyperpolarizabilities.

In the condensed phase, the story is quite diﬀerent. In order to perform molecular dy-

namics of the solvent molecules, we need to provide accurate empirical solvent-solvent and

solute-solute interaction potentials [1,2]. However, empirical models cannot accurately re-

produce many important modiﬁcations induced by the solute on the electronic structure

of the solvent molecules. Consequently, the use of simple ﬁxed point charge models for the

solvent ignores the polarization response of the solvent molecules to changes in the electronic

structure of the solute. Mixed approaches have been developed, in which a Monte Carlo

simulation of the solvent was coupled to a quantum mechanical description of the solute,

however, to date these have been performed at the Hartree-Fock level due the computational

overhead required to sample a statistically meaningful number of solvent conﬁgurations [3,4].

Furthermore, the representation of the solvent molecules by simple point charge models ne-

glects many important polarization induced eﬀects when computing the electronic structure

of the solute.

Solvent models have been developed in which the solvent is treated as a polarizable di-

electric continuum [5–8]. While the use of dielectric continuum models has a long history, the

latest generation of models are extremely sophisticated and include such features as realistic

solute cavities and exact description of the electrostatic problem [9–11]. Such Polarizable

Continuum Models (PCM) have been included in the Gaussian/94 (G94) [12] package al-

lowing an accurate extension of a variety of quantum chemical approaches (including HF,

MP2, CC, and DFT) to condensed phase problems. Such fully ab initio approaches are

2

currently accurate enough to interpret experimental hyperﬁne splittings and permit an un-

biased assessment of the role of electronic, vibrational, and solvation eﬀects in determining

the observed result [10]. The success of these models open the possibility for studying a

number of large biologically important radical species in their natural aqueous environment.

Ab initio molecular dynamics methods, especially the Density Functional Theory-

Molecular Dynamics (DFT-MD) methods introduced by Carr and Parrinello [13–15] (CP)

have been highly successful in describing a variety of chemical phenomena in the condensed

phase [15–17]. The CP method avoids the necessity of providing semi-empirical pseudopoten-

tials for the molecular forces by solving the Kohn-Sham equations for the electronic density

for a given nuclear conﬁguration. The molecular dynamics are then solved under the Born-

Oppenheimer approximation in which the nuclei move under the Hellmann-Feynman forces

computed by the DFT calculation. Additional quantum eﬀects in the nuclear motion, such

as energy level quantization and barrier tunneling, can be introduced through path integral

dynamics [18,19]. While this methods is useful in determining mechanistic details of many

chemical reactions, electronic transition due to the non-adiabatic motion of the nuclei can-

not be properly include due to the fact the Kohn-Sham equations are not guaranteed to be

convergent variationally for states other than the electronic ground state. Thus, all nuclear

dynamics are conﬁned to the ground adiabatic potential energy surface. For a large number

of systems of chemical importance, this level of description is suﬃcient. However, for many

systems, sudden changes in the solute quantum state play pivotal roles in determining the

dynamics of the reaction.

Quantum-classical simulations overcome many fundamental shortcomings associated

with both classical molecular dynamics (MD) and the quantum chemical methods men-

tioned above. Foremost amongst the assumptions in both MD and quantum chemistry is

that all the dynamics occur on a single potential energy surface under the Born-Oppenheimer

approximation. Quantum mechanical eﬀects arising from tunneling and dynamical interfer-

ence eﬀects and discrete energy levels are completely absent in classical MD. These eﬀects

become signiﬁcant particularly in low temperature systems containing hydrogen atom mo-

tions and for computing various time-dependent spectroscopic observables. The restriction

of the dynamics to a single Born-Oppenheimer potential surface is another serious limita-

3

tion. For each non-degenerate electronic state of the many-atom system there is a distinct

Born-Oppenheimer potential energy surface parameterized by the positions of all the atoms.

When a transition between electronic states occurs, the forces acting on the atoms may

change dramatically. Thus the proper and self consistent incorporation of these eﬀects is

crucial to describing a wide host of chemical dynamical eﬀects, many of which are important

to free radical dynamics. [20]

Electronically non-adiabatic processes play a surprisingly ubiquitous role in chemical

reaction dynamics for a wide number of systems including photosynthesis, polymeric chain-

reactions, photodissociation, and electron transfer reactions. and various aspects which

must be considered in order to simulate such processes for a condensed matter system.

Foremost amongst the goals of this chapter is to present the quantum-classical methodology

as a useful method of simulating these processes in the condensed phase, to discuss some of

the subtle aspects of non-adiabatic dynamics which we have demonstrated to be important

considerations, and to present some of our recent results obtained using these methods.

We consider here a system composed of a few important degrees of freedom which include

any reaction coordinate we care to choose coupled to a much larger number of degrees of

freedom which we shall refer to as the bath. We shall treat the motions of the system using

quantum mechanics and motions in the bath via classical mechanics. The quantum motions

may be, for example, nuclear motions, as in the hydrogen transfer reaction, electronic de-

grees of freedom as in the case of an electron transfer reaction or non-radiative relaxation

process, a combination of the two, and so forth. One important class of motions of chemical

import which are inherently quantum mechanical in nature are transitions between discrete

electronic states. Since the nuclear positions and velocities of all the molecules in the system

determine the electronic states and the transition amplitudes between the states and the

states and transition amplitudes in turn inﬂuence the the forces governing the trajectories,

any mixed quantum classical theory must treat self-consistently the classical and quantal

degrees of freedom.

The aqueous electron, nature’s simplest radical anion, provides an ideal test case system

for the methods which we shall develop below. Many of the dynamical features present in

this system have analogues in other systems in which energy quantization, non-radiative

4

energy transfer, and other quantum eﬀects play import roles. The aqueous electron is one

of the very few important chemical systems which can be described more or less exactly

without resorting to various levels of quantum chemical approximations. Thus, it provides

a unique testcase for a variety of dynamical theories.

The remainder of this chapter is organized as follows: we ﬁrst present a general overview

of classical molecular dynamics and Monte-Carlo methods. This is aimed as a general

overview of the use of molecular simulational methods. As a part of this overview, we

discuss recent developments in ab initio molecular dynamics, in particular the density func-

tional theory methods developed by Carr and Parrinello. We then focus our discussion on

nonadiabatic simulations. We present the formal details of quantum/classical dynamics and

highlight two important considerations which are necessary to address: the treatment of in-

teraction force and the treatment of the phase coherence between the quantum and classical

subsystems. We then move on to show results of simulations based upon these methods fo-

cusing primarily upon the role that quantum decoherence plays in determining the survival

timescale of an excited electronic state using the aqueous electron as a prototypical system,

highlighting the interplay which has evolved between theoretical and experimental studies

of this system over the past few years. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of future

directions we and others are undertaking to apply the methods discussed here to a variety

of other systems.

II. EXCESS ELECTRON AS A PROTOTYPICAL FREE RADICAL SYSTEM

The solvated electron provides perhaps the simplest example of electronic dynamics in

the condensed phase. Aqueous electrons are of particular importance since they play a

prominent role in the broad area of radiation chemistry of water.

In spite of intensive

experimental and theoretical study since identiﬁcation of the hydrated electron over 30 years

ago, many dynamical features of electron solvation have remained incompletely understood,

largely due to the extremely fast timescales on which electronic relaxation occurs [21]. Newly

developed femtosecond spectroscopic techniques are now providing glimpses of the details of

condensed phase electronic dynamics. From a theoretical standpoint, the aqueous electron is

an ideal test case for new condensed phase theories. Recent theoretical advances in treating

5

condensed phase electronic dynamics [22–26] has led to an exceptional interplay between

theory and experiment, helping to unravel many subtle dynamical aspects of this system.

While excess aqueous electrons are often prepared in conjunction with chemical reactions

and charge transfer reactions in H2O, experimental preparation of the electron in neat water

can be accomplished by direct photoionization of water. Following injection into the water,

the electron typically has 2.0 to 2.5 eV of excess energy which must be absorbed by the

water as the electron is solvated. Initially, the electron is delocalized in a continuum band of

energy levels. However, the electron rapidly localizes into one of three nearly degenerate p-

state and subsequently relaxes to an s-state where it is further solvated by the surrounding

water molecules. This fully solvated species exists until scavenged by impurities in the

system (typically on the order of a few hundred ns for ultra-pure water). The kinetics of

the localization process has been extensively studied both theoretically and experimentally.

The fully solvated electron can be regarded as a particle in a hard roughly prolate

spheroidal cavity formed by the surrounding water molecules. The ﬁrst “solvation shell”

of water molecules is an octahedral structure with hydrogen atoms on the vertices with

an average e-/O radius of

3.2 ˚A. In the fully solvated state, the water molecules in the

≈

surrounding shells arrange themselves as to maximize the hydrogen bonding network. The

ﬁrst excited states of this system are p-states lying roughly 1.7 eV above the ground state

which are split due to slight asymmetry of the shell of water molecules about the electron.

The energy gap between the s and p states and the energies of the p states are modulated

by ﬂuctuations in the local solvent structure.

In the simulations which we shall discuss through the course of this chapter, we assume

that the electron has been prepared in a equilibrated s-state and subsequently promoted

into one of the p-states when the s-p energy gap becomes 1.7 eV simulating the eﬀect of

the 720 nm laser excitation pulse used in the experiments performed by the Barbara and

co-workers. The relaxation mechanism following excitation is given by

Following promotion into one of the p-states at t = 0, the system is no longer in equilibrium

and solvent water molecules move to accommodate the new distribution of electronic charge

Thus, measurements of the excited state lifetime reﬂect both the non-radiative decay of the

state as well as the solvation/relaxation dynamics of the surrounding media. The solvation

dynamics of this system have been extensively studied by Schwartz and Rossky. The excited

and the water solvent molecules respond to resolvate the electron. Figure 1 shows the results

of two typical runs following preparation in the excited state.

An important puzzle concerning the non-adiabatic dynamics of the hydrated electron

has been the surprising lack of a sizable isotope eﬀect on the non-adiabatic transition rate.

shows that the nuclear velocities, ~v, play a direct role in determination of the non-adiabatic

transition rate. Since the fastest nuclear velocities in D2O (the D’s) are classically √2 times

slower than those in H2O (the H’s) while the other factors (the electron-water interaction

potential, the quantum force on the nuclei, etc.) remain the same, the expectation is that

non-adiabatic transition rates should be roughly half as large in D2O compared to H2O.

Indeed, mixed quantum-classical simulations have suggested isotope eﬀects of factors of 2

−
4 for the electronic transition rate in this system. [29–31] Experiments, however, have found

at most a modest diﬀerence in the non-adiabatic transition rate for electrons photo-injected

into H2O versus D2O, [32–34] and at most a 15% isotopic eﬀect have been extracted from

femtosecond spectroscopic studies of photoexcited equilibrium electrons. [28,35] This dispar-

ity between theory and experiment comes as a surprise given the level of sophistication of the

7

theories and their ability to match experiment on many other aspects of the system. This

has caused us to re-evaluate the quantum-classical methodology and examine the various

approximations used to derive the method, which we shall describe in detail in the following

section.

III. QUANTUM-CLASSICAL METHODOLOGY

A. Non-adiabatic Dynamics

Due to the fundamental role that dynamical process play in chemical reactivity, there

is a large body of literature devoted to extracting dynamical information from computer

simulations for both adiabatic and non-adiabatic dynamics.

[23,24,36–44] As discussed

above, it is not computationally feasible to treat a condensed phase dynamical system fully

quantum mechanically while retaining a molecular level description of the dynamics;

it

is, however, entirely possible to simulate the physics of interest by treating a select few

degrees of freedom quantum mechanically while treating the remainder classically. The

general prescription goes as follows: write the total Hamiltonian in terms of “quantum” and

“classical” contributions,1

Htot = HQ(x, R) +

+ VC(R),

(4)

P 2
2m

where HQ(x, R) is the Hamiltonian for just the quantum variables, x, parameterized by

the classical coordinates, R. The other are the classical kinetic energy and the solvent-

solvent potential interaction, VC(R), which is independent of the quantum subsystem. The

quantum subsystem is propagated in concert with the classical particles using the time

dependent Schr¨odinger equation, (note: we set ¯h = 1 throughout)

1Rigorously, one should start from fully quantum realization of the system and introduce mixing

between the electronic and vibrational motions through the application of the vibrational kinetic

energy operator on the electronic wavefunction to arrive at these equations. C. f. M. Born and K.

∇Rψ(x; R, t). Under the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, the
quantum subsystem is assumed to respond much faster than the timescale set by the motion

˙R

of the classical particles. When this is the case, the non-adiabatic coupling term can be

ignored and the classical particles evolve on the adiabatic potential energy surfaces deﬁned

by solving the time independent Schr¨odinger equation at each classical conﬁguration, R, for

When the non-adiabatic coupling becomes signiﬁcant, such as at an avoided crossing of

the adiabatic energy surfaces, the classical motion can induce transitions in the quantum sub-

system. As the classical particles move away from regions of strong non-adiabatic coupling,

the classical particles must evolve on a given adiabatic surface. This asymptotic condition

introduces a twist on the classical dynamics since the classical particles must “switch” sur-

faces during the course of a quantum transition. Various computational schemes have been

developed which incorporate this switching aspect into the classical dynamics. Perhaps the

most straightforward scheme is the “surface hopping algorithm” pioneered by Tully [38,40]

subsequently incorporated in the work of Webster, Friesner, and Rossky [23,24] and of Coker

and coworkers [37,43,45,46]. The general feature of all these algorithms is that the classical

9

(6)

(7)

(8)

particles stochastically “switch” between quantum states according to a criteria determined

by the quantum transition probability between the initial and ﬁnal quantum states over a

given time interval. Thus, over the course of a simulation, a switching trajectory emerges as

the quantum system hops between the various quantum states tracing out a path through

state space.

In mixed quantum-classical simulations, we assume that the nuclear motion of at least

a few degrees of freedom can be treated via classical mechanics and that the evolution of

remaining degrees of freedom can be treated via quantum mechanics parameterized by the

classical variables. The coherent evolution of the reduced density matrix along a given

classical trajectory, ρ(R), is given by the Liouville equation

Here, the density matrix, ρ(R(t)), is deﬁned along a single trajectory, R(t) as

These probabilities are computed at each time step over the course of the simulation and de-

termine whether or not the classical degrees of freedom will continue to evolve on the present

energy surface or if they must switch energy surfaces due to a non-adiabatic transition in the

quantum degrees of freedom. This particular approach for computing the quantum transi-

tion probability has the desired advantage that it minimizes the number of switches between

states all the while maintaining the correct statistical distribution of state populations at

all times. [40]

In the Molecular Dynamics with Quantum Transitions (MDQT) algorithm [40,42], the

classical variables switch suddenly between the adiabatic potential surfaces at the switching

times. Such abrupt changes in the potential energy when an electronic transition does occur

causes a change in the total energy of the system. In the MDQT method, the velocity of

the classical variables are modiﬁed in order to properly conserve energy [40] by randomly

rescaling the velocity vectors of the classical particles along the direction of non-adiabatic

transition vector such that the transition energy is transferred from the quantum to the

classical degrees of freedom (or vise verse) in such a way that the total energy of the system

is conserved. We shall next discuss a theory in which the trajectories move on an eﬀective

potential which changes smoothly as the quantum state evolves from the initial to ﬁnal state

over a ﬁnite time interval.

11

1. Solvent-Solute Coupling in the Presence of Quantum Transitions

When a quantum transition does occur, the forces coupling the quantum system to the

solvent change to reﬂect the new electronic state. This change is often dramatic, especially

in transitions between an excited state and the ground electronic state. For example, in

the case of an excess electron in H2O, the ﬁrst excited state is a p-state while the ground

state is a roughly spherical s-state. Furthermore the partially solvated p-state occupies a

much larger solvation cavity than the ground state for the same solvent conﬁguration. Thus,

both the shape and spatial distribution of the electron changes suddenly as the result of an

electronic transition. Consequently, the forces coupling the electron to the solvent change

suddenly as well. A proper description of the solvent-solute coupling must accommodate

these sudden changes.

A further consideration is the fact that the total energy of the system must be conserved.

Any energy involved in making a transition in the quantum state must be absorbed or

transferred to the solvent continuously throughout the transition. In the case of an excess

e−in H2O, the p-s transition dumps roughly 0.5 eV of electronic energy into the solvent.

This energy must be accommodated by the solvent translational, librational, and vibrational

motions in a time scale of a few femtoseconds.

Along a given path, R(t), the partial quantum transition amplitude between an initial

and ﬁnal quantum state,

The transition amplitude for the quantum subsystem, Uif [R(t)], is a complex functional

of R(t). We can obtain a semiclassical approximation for the combined system/bath propa-

gator, Kf i(Rf , Ri; t) on the assumption that the magnitude of U[R] varies much more slowly

This force is a functional of the trajectory which we are trying to calculate over the course

of a simulation and must be solved iteratively. In other words, we guess a path and a set

of end points, compute the quantum wavefunction for the new conﬁguration, propagate

the initial wave forward in time and the ﬁnal wave back in time to a set of intermediate

times to compute the forces for a new path and continue with this cycle until either the

procedure satisﬁes some convergence criteria or one simply runs out of patience or CPU

time. This semiclassical/stationary phase description of the coupling between the quantum

and classical variables is a central feature in the quantum/classical stationary phase surface

hopping methods developed by Webster, Friesner, and Rossky (WFR) [23,24,41]. While

providing an exact semi-classical description of the forces coupling the quantum and classical

subsystems, the computational overhead required to iteratively determine the classical path

can be quite large, especially if there are two or more paths with nearly identical action or if

the time interval is taken to be too large. This creates considerable computational overhead

since the motion of all of the solvent species must be determined variationally rather than

through a propagative scheme, such as the Verlet algorithm.

Furthermore, when we specify the initial and ﬁnal states of the quantum solute, we are

in eﬀect imposing a quantum measurement on the solute which destroys coherence in the

quantum subsystem. In the algorithm developed by Webster, Friesner, and Rossky (WFR),

this “computational coherence timescale” is chosen to be identical to the timescale required

to accurately compute the fastest motions in the solvent. Later developments by Coker and

co-workers [37,43,45,46] and later by Bittner and Rossky [36,48–50] have allowed for full

retention and partial retention of coherence.

2. Treating the phase coherence between the solvent and solute subsystems: Consistent Histories

Formulation

In both the MDQT and WFR/SP approaches, the classical switching path can be written

as a time ordered sequence of events,

Rα(t) =

Rα◦
◦ ,

{

· · ·

, Rαj
j

, Rαn
n }

· · ·

(23)

in which superscript αj denotes the switching outcome at time-step j and α◦ = i correspond-

ing to our choice of the initial quantum state. Two such paths are shown schematically in

Fig. 1 where we plot the eigenenergy of the occupied state along the path as a function of

time for an aqueous electron following laser excitation. Changes in the quantum state imply

that there is a corresponding sudden change in the forces exerted on the classical particles

14

over the course of its evolution. The result is that diﬀerent sequences of switching events

will lead to rapidly diverging paths.

Each path of the quantum subsystem will have associated with it a unique classical path

characterizing the slight diﬀerences in the bath dynamics arising from the slight diﬀerences in

the forces from diﬀerent quantum paths. These slight diﬀerences in the bath dynamics mean

that bath trajectories will be divergent even on a very short time scale. The result of this

is that the oﬀ-diagonal elements of the quantum density matrix will be rapidly diminished

as the various bath paths diverge. Thus, coherence in the quantum subsystem is lost due to

the slight diﬀerences in the bath dynamics for each quantum path. We now explore the issue

of phase coherence between the solvent and solute subsystems. Our approach is based upon

a novel interpretation of quantum mechanics introduced by Griﬃths [51], Omn`es [52,53],

and Gell-Mann and Hartle [54–56] over roughly the past 10 years. This interpretation of

quantum mechanics, termed “consistent” or “decoherent” histories, has generated a great

deal of attention in the ﬁeld of quantum cosmology [57–60].

Let us consider the evolution of an initial quantum state

R◦, along a switching path, Rα(t). During each time interval, we determine whether or not

above, modify the classical dynamics accordingly, and record the outcome of each switching

Notice that this deﬁnition of the transition probability no longer involves a single path.

In fact, the transition probability depends upon all other alternative paths which could

ultimately lead to the ﬁnal state. When the sequence of switching events for a pair of paths,

Rα(t) and Rβ(t) are identical, the contribution from the classical action will vanish and the

quantum transition probability along a given path is given simply by

Pif (t) =

(26)

which is identical to the transition probability we write in the previous section. Applying the

assumption of Eq. 26 to a switching path implies that the coherences between the quantum

states are not damped by the bath. This can lead to the overestimation of the non-adiabatic

transition rates as demonstrated in Ref. [36].

When transitions do occur, we must consider the phase interference between the various

alternative switching pathways. At short times following a switch, there will be a signiﬁcant

contribution from the phase interferences between two alternative paths with similar histories

and the total transition probability is the sum over the partial transition amplitudes for each

pathway. [61] However, at longer times following a switch, the action diﬀerence between two

paths will be very large so that the phase interferences will be added destructively, leaving

a sum over incoherent transition probabilities. In short, there will be considerable phase

coherence between paths with similar histories but little or no phase coherence between paths

with dissimilar histories. The timescale over which we must explicitly consider quantum

interference eﬀects between alternative pathways is the quantum decoherence time.

Recently we demonstrated that quantum decoherence eﬀects can be consistently incor-

porated into mixed quantum-classical systems by recognizing that restricting the quantum

evolution to given classical pathways is equivalent to making a series of quantum measure-

ments on the total system. [36,48,49] The classical path sequence shown in Eq. 23 and illus-

trated in Fig 1 is an example of a quantum mechanical history. Along this history, the time

evolution operator for the quantum system can be written equivalently as a time ordered

sequence of alternating quantum projection operators and unitary evolution operators

is the unitary evolution operator for the quantum wavefunction along a segment of the

switching path. Every time we “roll the dice” to determine the next quantum state along
the switching path, we need to apply the projection operator ˆP to the quantum wavefunction.

In general the projection operators in Eq. 28 are any operator acting on the Hilbert space

of the quantum subsystem. In practice, we have found the Gaussian form to be useful.

the states is retained. On the other hand, taking α = 0 means that we project out only

the state determined by the random switching event killing oﬀ any coherences between the

eigenstates.

In our approach, we use the decoherence timescale to set a characteristic time interval

between subsequent applications of the projection operators. During this interval, transition

amplitudes are added coherently according to the rules of quantum mechanics. Application

of the projection operators destroys the coherences and we are left with transition proba-

bilities which are then added according to the rules of standard probability theory. Within

our approach, Eq. 24 is rewritten as

The ﬁrst term contains the Liouvillian of the system,

system under this term alone is unitary and non-dissipative. The second term introduces

quantum decoherence into the dynamics of the quantum subsystem due to the series of

projections described above. The coherences originally in the quantum subsystem decay

due to the series of weak measurements imposed by the environment.

Both ˆC[Rα(t)]ρi(R◦) ˆC †[Rα(t)] in Eq. 32 and the density matrix in Eq.36 is a functional

of only a single classical trajectory as opposed to a sum over pairs of trajectories as in Eq. 24.

Where did the other paths go? It turns out that all pairs of paths are still included in these

equations, except that we periodically “prune” the paths which branch away from the main

18

bundle of paths at either the switching times (when we determine a quantum transition to

have occurred) or when we have determined that a “measurement” has occurred by randomly

making the density matrix diagonal through application of the projection operators or by

smoothly diminishing the oﬀ diagonal coherence using the master equation. Both methods

are formally equivalent.

When the quantum system is coupled linearly in ˆQ to a bath of oscillators, the ﬂuctu-

ations in the quantum system become proportional to the ability of the bath to dissipate

energy. Under such conditions for a Markov bath, the relation is [62]

α
4τ

=

2mγ◦kT
¯h2

,

(37)

where γ◦ is the dissipation constant. One can then relate decoherence in the quantum system

to ﬂuctuations in the harmonic bath through the ﬂuctuation-dissipation theorem. In essence,

our decoherence ansatz is entirely consistent with other theories of quantum dissipation.

In other theories of quantum relaxation, such as the spin-boson model

[63,64], master

equations such as the Redﬁeld relaxation theory [65–69], or Liouville space methods [70],

both decoherence and dissipation are treated implicitly through eﬀective equations of motion,

thus losing the molecular level information about the relaxation dynamics. In our treatment,

dissipation is included explicitly through the classical molecular dynamics of the condensed

phase medium, thus retaining a molecular level description. Quantum decoherence is treated

implicitly in order to avoid summing over alternative pairs of classical paths.

3. Decoherence Timescales

Because our formalism relies upon an a priori knowledge of the decoherence time scale

for the given system, we desire a molecular level theory of the process, allowing access

to a measure of the quantum decoherence timescale.

In developing a theory of quantum

decoherence we introduced parameters which characterize the decay of coherences due to

diﬀerences in the dynamics of the bath for each possible quantum state. Here we shall

make use of the projection operator to solidify that concept and determine how one can

go about obtaining a measure of the coherence time and length scales from realistic mixed

quantum/classical simulations.

Let us consider the eﬀect of coarse graining over a few timesteps. A the initial time t◦, we

select the initial state of the total system to be a pure state given by

As a result of the projection, there is little or no phase coherence between the various

eigenstates composing this set. Since each adiabatic eigenstate deﬁnes a diﬀerent adiabatic

potential which the classical path may follow from this point in time until the next time step,

each adiabatic state will deﬁne a unique coarse grained path or “branch” for the classical

evolution. Select a branch using some selection criteria and propagate the state under the

Hamiltonian, H(R1(t)), where R1(t) is a classical trajectory along a given branch labeled by

the sequence of adiabatic potential surfaces followed by the trajectory. We accumulate these

as an indication of the history of choices made along the path. Again at time t2, resolve

the new state at t2 in a basis of eigenstates of H(R1(t2)) and select a new branch for the

classical dynamics

One can begin to see the conceptual underpinnings of the decoherent histories approach

to quantum mechanics. At each level of coarse graining, the evolution of the classical

variables branches into diﬀerent possible histories where each branch indicates evolution

along a diﬀerent adiabatic potential surface. The evolution of the total quantum state

depends very much upon the particular history,

∆n, ∆n−1,

, selected at each time step.

{

· · ·}

20

In other words, when we allow the classical variables to switch between adiabatic potentials

at a particular time as the result of a electronic transition, the evolution of the electronic

system becomes dependent upon when the transitions actually occur.

Quantum coherence between alternative states is lost as the overlap between the alterna-

tives decays. We can provide an estimate for the rate at which coherence is lost considering

the short time evolution of the reduced density matrix along a given path. For example at

time t3, the reduced density matrix is given by

in time the overlap decays as (We drop the 321 and 3’21 notation and take R = R321 at

Such quantities are easily computable in mixed quantum/classical simulations and pro-

vide a convenient measure for coherence times in simulations. We shall later use this measure

to assess the choice of decoherence times in simulations of the dynamics of an excess elec-

tron in ordinary and heavy water. [48] The coherence time for one bath conﬁguration will

be quite diﬀerent than the coherence time for another conﬁguration. However, one can envi-

sion a case in which quantum transitions occur only when the classical variables are in a few

rare conﬁgurations. In this case a global decoherence time would not provide an accurate

measure of the decoherence timescale. As we shall demonstrate next, even small changes in

the decoherence timescale can have profound eﬀects on both the quantum and the classical

evolution.

4. Coherence Times For Physical Systems

We can estimate the decay of quantum coherence for the hydrated electron from Eq.

46 with information available from excited state simulations. For the present example, the

initial state i is the equilibrium excited state of the hydrated electron, and the ﬁnal state j

is the ground state of the electron. For the widths of the frozen Gaussians, we chose

(45)

(46)

(47)

4mω = 6mkT

22

which results from rigorous analysis of the non-adiabatic transition rate between displaced

harmonic oscillators in the high temperature limit, [29,30] and also allows for direct com-

parison to the earlier calculations of Neria and Nitzan. [29,30] To compute the average de-

coherence decay we constructed ensemble of excited state conﬁgurations by assuming that

the system was equilibrated at times past 1 ps after being prepared in the excited state. n

We chose 20 conﬁgurations at 25-50 fs intervals from each of 5 individual trajectories for a

total of 100 conﬁgurations. Details of these simulations are given in the Appendix.

The results of this calculation are shown as in Fig. 2. For the hydrated electron the

coherence decays in a roughly Gaussian manner, and a Gaussian ﬁt to the decay has a

variance of

3.1 fs. Another estimate of the decoherence time is found in the area under

≈

the curve, which for this example is 2.8 fs. This result is in good agreement with previous

calculations using a diﬀerent model for the hydrated electron, [29,30] and demonstrates a

posteriori justiﬁcation for the hypothesis of a

1 fs coherence time in the earlier non-

≈

equilibrium simulations. We also note that the rapid decoherence of this system provides

a posteriori justiﬁcation for the short time approximation used to estimate

J(t)

. We ﬁnd

h

i

that the exponential is typically dominated by only 5 to 10 nuclei which are the closest to

the bulk of the electronic charge density. This makes sense from the stance that the largest

diﬀerence in force between the two surfaces will be for nuclei in positions where the charge

density, is large on one surface and small on the other.

We also show the coherence decay curve for an excited electron in D2O computed simi-

larly. The coherence decay in D2O is qualitatively similar to that in H2O, only for D2O the

approximate Gaussian decay time is

4.6 fs (versus

3.1 fs for H2O) and the area under

≈

≈

the curve is 4.1 fs (versus 2.8 fs for H2O).

The longer coherence time in heavy water compared to light water arises predominantly

from the diﬀerence in mass in the choice of the Gaussian width. For classical H2O and D2O,

the probability of a given nuclear conﬁguration is the same. Static ensemble properties for

the two ﬂuids should be identical since the ensembles contain identical nuclear conﬁgurations

with equal statistical weights. 2 Since the electronic Hamiltonian for the solvated electron

2This is true for classical water models. When quantum mechanical eﬀects are properly included,

23

is identical for both heavy and light water, the static ensemble averaged potential energy

diﬀerence and the diﬀerence in Hellmann-Feynman forces on the two surfaces will also be

identical for the two ﬂuids. Thus, the only diﬀerences in the evaluation of the coherence

decay for the two ﬂuids is through the mass term that enters through the Gaussian width.

Since the nuclear overlap part of the coherence decay depends on the sum over nuclei, the

mass change leads to the net slower decay of coherence in D2O versus H2O. In fact, for the

purposes of evaluating J(t) for the solvated electron in D2O, the H2O simulations would

suﬃce.

The diﬀerent coherence decay times in the two solvents play a direct role in determin-

ing the isotope eﬀect on the overall non-adiabatic transition rate. In simpliﬁed terms, to

determine the non-adiabatic transition rate before quantum coherence has decayed, non-

adiabatic transition amplitudes should be added; after the decoherence interval, memory of

the complex phases is lost and non-adiabatic transition probabilities should be added.

5. Eﬀect of Decoherence on Quantum Transition Rates

One of the primary eﬀects of electronic coherence loss can be observed in the evaluation

of the switching probabilities. If we approximate the short time evolution of the density

matrix as

This predicts that one should see a change over from non-adiabatic dynamics to adiabatic

dynamics as the coherence timescale becomes very small. Thus, even in this relatively simple

H2O and D2O have slightly diﬀerent properties due to diﬀerences in the spatial dispersion of the

H and D nuclei. C. f. G. S. Delbuono, P. J. Rossky, J. Schnitker, J. Chem. Phys. 95, 3728 (1991).

model of coherence loss, it is readily apparent that decoherence due to the coupling to an

external environment generally tends to suppress quantum eﬀects and increases the degree

of adiabaticity in the quantum subsystem [36].

As one can see from the last set of equations, one can estimate the eﬀect of coherence

loss on the quantum transition probability given a coherence timescale and the quantum

transition amplitudes for a given system. Recall that the origin of this equation is that

the classical degrees of freedom (the bath) make a series of quantum measurements on the

system at random time intervals. Thus we can write the non-adiabatic transition probability

between states i and j as a function of the measurement timescale τ as

(n∆t) is the quantum transition amplitude at the nth timestep starting from the

N th conﬁguration. In other words, to compute this quantity, we propagate the quantum

subsystem coherently over a coherence time picked from a distribution of possible coherence

times. During this interval we sum over amplitudes. At the end of the interval, coherences

between states are killed oﬀ and we sum over probabilities. The outer summation is over

starting conﬁgurations and wN (τ, n∆t) is the statistical weight for a given conﬁguration to

have a coherence time of τ . These are normalized by Q. The time step, ∆t is taken as the

shortest timestep used to propagate the equations of motion for the system. For the case of

the electron in H2O and D2O, this τ = 1 fs throughout.

In Fig. 3, we plot the estimated lifetime of the electron in the excited state as a function of

coherence timescale for both solvents. The solid lines, labeled “ﬁxed” refer to using a single

coherence time interval in evaluating Eq.50, i.e. wN (τ, n∆t)/Q = θ(τ

n∆t). The curves

−

labeled “Poisson” refer to lifetimes computed using a Poisson distribution of coherence time

intervals.

wN (τ, n∆t)/Q = exp(

n∆t/τ )/τ

−

(51)

Both curves track each other quite well. For a 1 fs coherence time, these lifetimes correspond

to

550 fs for H2O and

850 fs for D2O. The magnitude of these rates agree reasonably

≈

≈

with the rates reported in earlier simulations [26,71,72] and the roughly 2:1 simulated isotope

25

eﬀect is reproduced as well. While non-adiabatic transitions typically occur from conﬁgura-

tions with higher than average transition probabilities, these conﬁgurations are reasonably

rare that the average transition probability determined here provides a reasonable estimate

of the non-equilibrium population dynamics.

We can now use the coherence timescales estimated above to provide an estimate of

the excited state survival times. For equal coherence times of 1 fs, which was the original

assumption in the simulations by Schwartz and Rossky, the survival probabilities in Fig.3

predict roughly a 2:1 isotope eﬀect. However, when we use the decoherence times computed

above, we ﬁnd that the

50% diﬀerence in coherence times yields an estimation of the

≈

lifetimes which are identical to within 10%. Furthermore, the lifetimes and estimated isotope

eﬀect agree remarkably with the experimental values reported by Barbara. These results

are summarized in Table 1. This provides a clear demonstration that quantum decoherence

plays a direct and key role in the electronic dynamics of this system.

B. Decoherence in Quantum MD Simulations

Quantum decoherence can be also be incorporated into non-adiabatic quantum MD sim-

ulations through either the projection operator method or the master equation theory dis-

cussed above. In the statistical limit, both methods give identical results. [36] The com-

putational algorithm given below uses the projection operator approach (Eq.32) with the

coherence time intervals chosen from a Poisson distribution with characteristic time scale

τD = 3.1f s as derived from our estimates of the coherence time scale for an electron in H2O

when the excited state is nearly solvated. This time scale was estimated by computing the

average decay time of the overlap of frozen Gaussian vibrational wavefunctions evolving on

diﬀerent adiabatic potential energy surfaces by sampling a large number of nearly equivalent

excited state conﬁgurations. Also note that this method can be used for both the MDQT

method and the WFR/SP methods since we assume that the treatment of the quantum-

classical forces is independent of coherence retention. The consistent histories algorithm

proceeds as follows:

1. Determine coherence interval from Poisson distribution of possible intervals with char-

26

acteristic time scale τD.

2. Propagate the quantum wavefunction over this time scale while self consistently evolv-

ing the classical degrees of freedom. At the end of each dynamical time step h

τD,

≤

determine the switching path followed by the classical variables using the stationary

phase algorithm developed by Webster, et al. [23,24] modiﬁed such that coherence in

the quantum wavefunction is maintained over the entire coherence interval. We also

note that the stationary phase switching path is determined in a piece-wise continuous

fashion by selecting intermediate quantum states every dynamical time step. This is

to avoid the computational overhead of computing variationally the stationary phase

trajectory over relatively long time intervals. So long as τD is no longer than a few

dynamical time steps, this approximation should not be too extreme; however, certain

pathological cases can be invented in which this approximation does break down.

3. If either a switch occurs in the time interval or we reach the end of the interval, the

quantum wavefunction is collapsed using the projection operators discussed above.

4. Repeat.

In Fig. 4 we plot the switching times from the excited state to the ground state for

a total of 23 simulation runs. The starting conﬁgurations were generated by performing

a 35 ps simulation in which the electron was prepared in the ground state and 16 initial

conﬁgurations were chosen whenever the energy diﬀerence between the ground state and one

of the p-like excited states become resonant with the excitation laser (1.7 eV).

[35,28,73]

These starting conﬁgurations were identical to conﬁgurations used previously by Schwartz

and Rossky in their work on this system.

[26,71,72] Following the initial excitation, the

system was allowed to evolve. During this time, the energy gap between the p-states and

the s-state narrowed to

0.5eV as the excited state was solvated by the surrounding water

≈

molecules. The simulation continued until a switch from the excited state to the ground

state was recorded.

Immediately after the switch, the energy gap between the occupied

ground state and the ﬁrst excited state widened dramatically as the solvent responded to

the new electronic state. The average and median switching times from these simulations

are compiled in Table 2.

27

In order to test the sensitivity of the switching times to the choice of sequence of coherence

intervals, ﬁve conﬁgurations were “recycled” by using diﬀerent random number sequences

for the coherence time intervals to generate diﬀerent switching paths starting from the same

initial conﬁguration. For each such pairs of paths, the classical dynamics were identical

up until the earlier switching time when one of the paths switched from the excited state

to the ground state. However, since the coherences between the diﬀerent quantum states

were killed oﬀ at randomly diﬀerent times for each path, each path sampled a diﬀerent

probability distribution function for making a switch at each MD time step. Hence any

correlations between switching times resulting using the same initial conﬁguration reﬂect

correlations in the distribution of coherence time intervals. Given that there is typically a

100 fs time diﬀerence between pairs of data (in one case a 530 fs diﬀerence) which is roughly

1/3 of the average survival time scale of the excited state, we ﬁnd very little correlation

between the switching times originating from the same initial conﬁguration.

As the excited state is solvated by the surrounding water molecules, the energy gap

between the excited state and the ground state narrows to its equilibrium value. Further-

more, from ﬁrst order perturbation theory, we expect that the electronic transition rate to

be inversely proportional to the magnitude of the energy diﬀerence between initial and ﬁnal

states. Thus, a simple model for the excited state survival probability can be written as

∂P (t)
∂t

=

keq
˜ω(t)

−

P (t)

(52)

subject to the initial condition P (0) = 1. Here, keq is the non-adiabatic transition rate

for the solvated excited state and ˜ω(t) is the average energy gap normalized to the average

energy gap of the solvated excited state. ˜ω(t) is related to the solvation response S(t) by

ωeqi

In Fig. 5, we plot ˜ω(t) using the ﬁt to the solvation response function generated by our

simulations. These ﬁts are nearly identical to those obtained by Schwartz and Rossky.

[31,25,26,71] At short times, when ˜ω(t) > 1, the non-adiabatic transition rate will be small

since the energy gap is large. At long times ˜ω(t)

1 as the energy gap relaxes to its

→

equilibrium value. Thus, keq is the exponential decay constant of the excited state population

once the excited state is fully solvated.

Using a non-linear ﬁtting procedure, we ﬁt our data to this model to obtain an estimate

of the equilibrium non-adiabatic lifetime of 241 fs with a χ2 = 1.707. A plot of our data

superimposed on this ﬁt is given in Fig. 4. Interestingly enough, our data does not ﬁt this

simple model as nicely as the data given by Schwartz and Rossky. This suggests that the

longer coherence times used in this study imparts a non-trivial memory dependency into the

survival probability which is inadequately captured in Eq. 52.

As expected, the lifetimes reported here (Table 2) are consistently shorter than the

lifetimes reported by Schwartz and Rossky in which a constant 1 fs coherence time scale

throughout their simulations, thus emphasizing the profound sensitivity of these simulations

to the coherence time scale. Furthermore, our results are consistent with the estimated

lifetimes estimated above.

IV. DISCUSSION

In this chapter we have brieﬂy described the results of our work towards a molecular level

description of quantum relaxation phenomena. Here we have focused exclusively upon the

role that transient quantum mechanical coherences between the solvent and the solute play in

the electronic relaxation of an excited solute species. In mixed quantum-classical computer

simulations, fundamental assumptions about the decay of these coherences produce direct

manifestations on the computed quantum mechanical transition rates and must be included

consistently in order to make realistic predictions and comparisons. [36,48]

We have focused our attention primarily upon electronically non-adiabatic processes and

various aspects which must be considered in order to simulate such processes for a condensed

matter system. In most quantum-chemical calculations, the fundimental assumption is that

the nuclear dynamics are well within the Born-Oppenheimer approximation and that break-

downs in this approximation are rare and unusual events. However, in nature the opposite

is largely true. Non-adiabatic events occur in a number of important chemical processes

including the process of vision and photosynthesis, predissociation, photodissociation, charge

29

transfer, spin-quenching, and charge transfer reactions of which free radical chemistry is a

vital component.

The computational algorithm, based upon the so-called consistent histories interpreta-

tion of quantum mechanics, provides both the molecular level underpinnings of quantum

decoherence and the computational means for properly including decoherence eﬀects in

non-adiabatic quantum-molecular dynamics simulations. According to the rules of ordinary

quantum mechanics, a quantum system will evolve into a coherent superposition of alter-

native states. In our decoherence theory, this coherence is dissipated due to the diﬀerences

in the forces exerted on the bath by alternative states involved in the superposition. Thus,

on short scales, a quantum system in a bath will obey the rules of ordinary quantum me-

chanics and evolve into a coherent superposition of states, whereas on longer time scales,

the coherences between states are diminished and the quantum system must be described as

statistical (i.e., incoherent) mixture of states. As the quantum system interacts continuously

with the bath, coherences between states are continuously created by non-adiabatic coupling

and damped by the divergence in the bath dynamics induced by the system-bath coupling.

This subtle interplay between coupling and decoherence and the subsequent dependency

of transition rates on the decoherence time scale has profound implications for a variety of

condensed phase chemical dynamics including: internal conversion and internal vibrational

energy redistribution (in which the bath is comprised of all the modes of the molecules

except for the one mode of interest), electronic energy transfer between molecules or diﬀerent

parts of the same molecule, and charge transfer reactions including proton and electron

transfer. In these latter examples, both the condensed phase environment and the internal

motions of the molecules act as a bath which couples the quantum states together. The

decay of quantum coherence, which depends upon the frequencies and populations of the

bath modes coupled to the quantum system will determine the extent to which the non-

adiabatic coupling can act to allow the chemical reaction to proceed. Changes in the spectral

density due to isotopic changes in the bath can have a substantial impact on non-adiabatic

chemical dynamics [48,49]. Furthermore, the decay of quantum coherence can determine the

adiabaticity for a chemical reaction.

Perhaps the two major lacunae in our theory of decoherence is the explicit dependency

30

upon an a priori estimate of the coherence time scale and the fact that this time scale

remains ﬁxed throughout the calculation. As mentioned above, we estimated this time scale

by computing the average decay time of the overlap of a product of Gaussian coherent states

evolving on diﬀerent adiabatic potential energy surfaces. In this estimate, the individual

widths of the coherent state wavefunctions centered about the initial phase space points of

the classical nuclei are set to be proportional to the thermal DeBroglie wavelength of each

nuclei. Although physically realistic for a variety of situations, this does leave the coherence

length scale (i.e. the widths) as an adjustable parameter. While the eﬀects of changing

the coherence length scale over a broad range have not been systematically studied, results

from our previous work demonstrate that the non-adiabatic transition is quite sensitive to

changes in the coherence time scale and hence will be sensitive to changes in the coherence

length scales. Furthermore, as the bath explores various regions of the quantum potential

energy surface, the force diﬀerences which give rise to the decay of the quantum coherences

should vary from one conﬁguration to the next. [48] Current progress is underway towards

obtaining both the coherence length and time scale during the course of the non-adiabatic

simulation ab initio by examining the quantum mechanical ﬂuctuations of the bath particles

about their stationary phase paths.

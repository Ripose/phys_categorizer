Abstract

A simple dynamical system that models the competitive thermokinetics and
chemistry of cellulose decomposition is examined, with reference to evidence from
experimental studies indicating that char formation is a low activation energy
exothermal process and volatilization is a high activation energy endothermal pro-
cess. The thermohydrolysis chemistry at the core of the primary competition is
described. Essentially, the competition is between two nucleophiles, a molecule of
water and an -OH group on C6 of an end glucosyl cation, to form either a reducing
chain fragment with the propensity to undergo the bond-forming reactions that ul-
timately form char or a levoglucosan-end-fragment that depolymerizes to volatile
products. The results of this analysis suggest that promotion of char formation
under thermal stress can actually increase the production of ﬂammable volatiles.
Thus we would like to convey an important safety message in this paper: in some
situations where heat and mass transfer is restricted in cellulosic materials, such
as furnishings, insulation, and stockpiles, the use of char-promoting treatments for
ﬁre retardation may have the eﬀect of increasing the risk of ﬂaming combustion.

Introduction

Thermokinetic and chemical feedback processes that determine the course and outcome
of cellulose thermal decomposition are of particular interest in the development of appro-
priate ﬂame-inhibiting treatments of manufactured goods such as bedding, furnishings,
and insulation, or stockpiled raw cellulosic material such as bagasse or hay. The fuel
that ignites in the ﬂaming combustion of cellulose substrates consists mostly of volatile,
small-molecule substances that are supplied continuously by thermal degradation of the
solid cellulose. In designing more eﬃcient and eﬀective ﬁre-retardants for cellulose —
and, more generally, in the pre-emptive control of cellulose combustion — it is thus im-
portant to understand both the dynamics and the chemistry of decomposition. In this
work we investigate a phenomenonological model for the thermal decomposition of cellu-
lose substrates that is based on the following two key aspects of the known chemistry and
thermokinetics: (1) involvement of water in promoting char formation, and (2) reaction
enthalpy feedback to promote volatilization.

A great many thermogravimetry (TG) and diﬀerential scanning calorimetry (DSC) ex-
periments, complemented by qualitative and quantitative product analysis, have aﬃrmed
that cellulose thermal decomposition is largely a competitive process [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7].
In the big picture that has taken shape from these results and from associated modelling
studies (for example, see [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13] and the reviews in [14] and [15]) formation
of volatiles and char are seen to be reciprocally linked to some extent.

Some details have also emerged of the chemistry involved in these competitive pathways
[16, 17, 18], although a complete picture of the complex reaction network remains a
major experimental challenge. What is clear though is that the involvement of water
in hydrolysis reactions is crucial in determining the rates and outcomes of the com-
petitive pathways. A thorough survey and compilation of the known chemistry and
thermokinetics of cellulose thermal decomposition was carried out in [19], on the basis
of which a dynamical model was built up that includes the role of water in the reac-
tion chemistry. In this paper we concentrate on the kinetic and thermal aspects of the
decomposition process, emphasizing the role played by thermal feedback in regulating
the decomposition pathways. We demonstrate the potential for thermal instabilities
by considering the qualitative behaviour of a very simple thermokinetic model, which
nevertheless contains the important rate processes in cellulose thermal decomposition:
competitive temperature-dependent reaction rates, reaction enthalpy feedback, and heat
losses.

2 Basic chemistry and phenomenology of cellulose

decomposition

The chemistry of the primary competitive reactions is illustrated in Fig 1.

[Figure 1 about here.]

The initial step is believed to be heterolytic thermal scission of glycosidic linkages at
random chain locations in amorphous regions of the cellulose. In a dry environment the
positively charged end (A in the ﬁgure) is rapidly cyclized to a levoglucosan end (B in
the ﬁgure), with the -OH group on C6 of the unit as nucleophile. Thermolysis at the
next glycosidic linkage of this fragment releases the volatile levoglucosan. When water is
present it can compete as a nucleophile for the positively charged centre on A to produce
a reactive reducing end (C in the ﬁgure). It is this species which is believed to undergo the
subsequent dehydration, decarboxylation, and cross-linking reactions that produce the
char. (The negatively charged fragment of the thermal scission rapidly picks up a positive
hydrogen ion from the -OH nucleophile group or from water to form a non-reducing end
D. In general, non-reducing ends of carbohydrates are relatively unreactive.)

Empirical methods for producing good yields of char by heating damp wood in an oxygen-
deﬁcient atmosphere have been used for centuries. Systematic investigations of this
eﬀect using DSC experiments were carried out by Mok et al [4], who observed that
either a high concentration of vapour products or added water increased char yield and
decreased the temperature of onset of decomposition. Subsequent analysis of these data
[20] led to the suggestion that the water produced in thermal dehydration reactions feeds
back to hydrolyse the unreacted cellulose. In [21] and [22] evidence was also presented
from pyrolysis experiments that product water accelerated the formation of char. Some
investigations of the role of the hydrolysis chemistry of cellulose under thermal stress in
producing this eﬀect were reported in [17] and [23].

It is also known that covered stockpiles of cellulosic materials such as bagasse, hay, and
cotton undergo spontaneous combustion much more readily when critically damp than
in dry conditions. Dynamical models that reproduce qualitatively the behaviour that
is typical in damp combustion have been investigated by Gray [24] and others [25, 26,
27, 28, 29]. In these systems, which model the combustion subsequent to decomposition,
critical, unstable, or oscillatory thermal behaviour can occur due to the coupling of two or
more nonlinear temperature-dependent reaction rates with restricted linear heat losses.

3 Alternative pathways are thermally connected

The studies reviewed brieﬂy in the previous section suggest the rather counter-intuitive
notion that water can increase the temperature of thermally decomposing cellulose. To
guide our thinking on this, we need to put together three pieces of information:

1. The volatilization rate is more temperature-sensitive, i.e., has higher activation
energy, than the charring rate. A typical experimental result that leads to this
inference was reported in [5]. It was found that as the pyrolysis temperature of
pine wood, cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin was increased, the percentage mass
of solid char decreased, while that of gas and oil (volatile or tar) products increased.

2. Estimates of the magnitude of the reaction enthalpies vary, but there is agreement
that the charring process is highly exothermal whereas volatilization is endother-
mal, at the very least to the extent of the enthalpy of vapourization of levoglucosan
(see for example [21, 30, 31, 32, 33]).

3. As described in [19], water of dehydration can participate in hydrolysis that eﬀec-

tively blocks the cyclization to levoglucosan.

Putting these together we can draw the schematic diagram of the competitive decompo-
sition shown in Fig 2.

[Figure 2 about here.]

As the substrate A is heated the low activation energy dehydration reactions are initiated.
The water produced by this process can feed back into hydrolysis reactions that inhibit
volatilization and enhance char formation. However, the charring reactions are bond-
forming and heat-releasing. Under circumstances where there is no eﬃcient linear heat
sink, the alternative, high activation energy, volatilization reactions begin to take over.
The heat requirement of volatilization means that it can self-damp, thus opening the
reaction ﬁeld again to the charring pathway. It is clear that there is potential for the
system to attain a stable steady state or limit cycle. In reality, of course, the situation
is more complex — and probably more dangerous, because accumulation of hot volatiles
in what is often a highly oxidizing environment is likely to lead to spontaneous ﬂaming
ignition.

4 A simple proxy for competitive thermal decompo-

sition

To strengthen our feel for the qualitative aspects of the system described above, we will
study the thermokinetics of the following simple competitive reaction scheme:

A

A + W

A + ∆

Rw−→ W + Y
k1(T )−→ Y + ∆
k2(T )−→ Z.

This may be viewed as a model for the the thermal decomposition of cellulose, with
A, W, Y, Z, and ∆ representing the substrate, water, dehydrated product or char,
volatiles, and heat respectively. Although a gross simpliﬁcation of the real process,
it nevertheless contains the important overall characteristics of temperature-dependent
reaction rates, reactive heat generation/consumption, and feedback of W. Making the
reasonable approximations that (1) the rate of supply Rw of W from reaction 1 is constant
(the activation energy for this reaction is believed to be very low) and thermally neutral,
(2) A is drawn from an “inﬁnite pool”, and (3) the system is spatially homogeneous with
linear heat dissipation, we can write the following dynamical equations to describe the
evolution of the vapour-phase components and the temperature:

= −e−1/uw + r − f w

= νe−µ/u − f z

dw
dτ
dz
dτ
du
dτ

¯C

= e−1/uw − ανe−µ/u + ℓ (ua − u) .

The dimensionless groups and the quantities from which they are comprised are explained
in the Appendix. Brieﬂy, w is the concentration of reactant water, z is the concentration
of volatile product, u is the dynamical temperature. Water is supplied by reaction 1 at
a temperature-independent, thermally neutral rate r, and is removed with the vapour-
phase outﬂow at rate f and by the hydrolysis process 2 that ultimately leads to char
formation. Volatiles are produced in process 3 and are also removed in the vapour-
phase outﬂow. Process 2 is a heat source, process 3 is a heat sink, and a linear heat
exchange with rate coeﬃcient ℓ is assumed to occur between the system and its immediate
environment at constant ambient temperature ua.

Eqs 4–6 are based on a CSTR (continuous stirred tank reactor) paradigm with two
temperature-dependent reaction rates. Comparable dynamical models that include two
or more temperature-dependent reaction rates have been analysed in the literature from
several points of view: fundamental studies of the dynamical and bifurcation behaviour
may be found in [34] and [35], applications to the wet combustion problem were cited
above, and their use in the the stabilization of thermal runaway reactions was described in
[36]. In all of these problems it was found that the coupling of two non-identical Arrhenius
terms could give rise to steady-state and oscillatory behaviour of greater complexity than
in corresponding systems with a single Arrhenius term. Concomitantly, it has been shown
that an endothermal reaction rate (the second term on the right-hand side of Eq. 6) can
stabilize the system temperature [36]. In this system the eﬀects of the high activation
energy endothermal reaction are modiﬁed by the rate r at which water is fed into the
exothermal reaction.

Some steady state solutions of Eqs 4–6, computed numerically, are shown in Fig 3, where
the dependence on ua is plotted for three values of r. Limit cycles, where they exist,
have also been computed and plotted as the amplitude maxima against ua. (Notes: (1)
Eq. 5 uncouples from Eqs 4 and 6. (2) With an assumed activation energy E1 of ∼50
kJ/mol a dimensionless temperature u of ∼0.1 corresponds to ∼600 K.)

[Figure 3 about here.]

In (a), where the supply of reactant is limiting, the temperature rise is monotonic as
ua is increased. When consumption of w begins at ua ∼0.08 the rate increases due to
thermal feedback, but when production of z cuts in at a higher temperature the rate
levels out again.

In (b) the situation is impressively diﬀerent, because the steady-state solutions change
stability at two Hopf bifurcations. Here a faster rate of supply induces oscillatory be-
haviour over the active range of ua. It is noteworthy that, near the onset of the oscil-
lations, the concentration of z (the ﬂammable volatiles) and the temperature can rise
dramatically at a relatively low ambient temperature. The amplitude and temperature
range of the oscillations is, of course, also inﬂuenced by the rate of non-reactive heat
removal ℓ and the rate at which vapour phase material is removed from the system.
However, it is not diﬃcult to imagine a situation of restricted heat and mass trans-
fer where this sudden surge in the temperature and concentration of volatiles leads to
spontaneous ignition of the volatiles, whence the system enters a new regime of ﬂaming
combustion.

In (c) a higher rate of reactant supply induces multiple steady states, with a jump
occurring at a comparatively low ambient temperature. Although the upper steady
state occurs at quite low values of u and z, it is unstable, and again u and z must jump
to a catastrophic limit cycle. (For clarity the complete branch of limit cycles is not shown
in (c), it terminates in a homoclinic orbit.) The amplitude of the limit cycles becomes
unrealistically high, due to the assumption of an inﬁnite pool of substrate that is built
into this simple model. Nevertheless, the qualitative eﬀect is similar to that in (b): the
temperature and volatile concentration can surge uncontrollably when the competing
reaction is initially encouraged.

5 Discussion and conclusion

To a large extent, the development of ﬁre-retarding treatments of and strategies for cel-
lulosic materials has been based on the large body of experimental evidence, some of
which was cited above, for the competitive nature of thermal decomposition. If char is
formed at the expense of volatile fuel, then intuition suggests that we should expect to
see a positive correlation between char yield and ﬁre resistance. Many diﬀerent addi-
tives to cellulosic materials have been found to enhance char-formation, e.g., chromated
copper arsenate treatments (CCA) [37], metal carboxylates [38], sodium hydroxide [32],
potassium chloride [39], phosphates [40], ammonium salts [41], and those studied in [42]
and [18]. Some of these are used commercially.

However, from the point of view of promoting ﬁre safety in real situations, the idea that
better charring properties equate to better ﬂame resistance is too simplistic, because of
the nonlinear feedback eﬀects on the competition between volatile and char formation
described in section 4. The results of this study indicate that char-forming treatments
should be used circumspectly, with proper consideration of the particular situation of
potential thermal decomposition — in particular, whether heat and volatiles are removed
eﬃciently enough to prevent the thermal feedback that promotes volatilization. Even
without taking into account the detailed role of the hydrolysis chemistry described in sec-
tion 2, it is clear from thermokinetic considerations alone that there is a delicate balance
between the amount of char and the degree of ﬁre resistance, because the temperature
— and therefore the rate of volatile fuel formation — can increase dramatically as the
exothermal charring reactions occur. In [32] it was reported that pyrolysis of cellulose be-
came strongly exothermal when the material was treated with large amounts of charring

Feedback processes in cellulose thermal decomposition . . .

retardant. Another mechanism by which extensive charring could become dangerous was
described in [43]: since char has much higher permeability than the unreacted substrate,
ﬂammable volatiles would ﬂow more rapidly through hot char as it forms. The volatiles
may either undergo secondary exothermal charring in the existing char, heating up the
system further, or ignite on contact with oxygen.

As pointed out in [6], many other factors such as rate of external heating, heat and
mass diﬀusion, secondary chemistry, and the immediate environment can inﬂuence the
decomposition process. None of these is built in to the simpliﬁed, homogeneous model
in section 4, which is a crude and much-reduced simpliﬁcation of a complex thermoki-
netic system. Nevertheless, it does reﬂect the reality of the eﬀects of cellulose thermal
decomposition (there is nothing ﬁne or subtle about a catastrophic spontaneous ﬁre in a
haystack, either), and it is consistent with the known important features of the process
— namely, the competitive pathways, the involvement of water, and the thermokinetics.
It is also not diﬃcult to envisage other situations where dangerous self-heating could
take place. It is often a statutory requirement that cellulosic materials in bedding, fur-
nishings, and textiles in nursing homes contain ﬁre-retardants. However, a bedding ﬁre
started by a cigarette is exactly the kind of situation we have in mind — the necessary
moisture would already be present and the heat of charring cannot easily escape, thus
provoking the volatilization reactions.

This study of a simple model does not pretend to be quantitatively precise. Rather,
its intent is to elicit important qualitative information concerning the dynamical be-
haviour of a cellulosic system under thermal stress, and highlight some thermokinetic
eﬀects that could be a consideration in the design of targeted ﬁre-retarding strategies for
cellulose. Further modelling studies will examine the thermokinetics in the presence of
ﬁre-retardants, and simulate cellulose decomposition behaviour in an oxidizing environ-
ment, looking at critical conditions for ignition of the volatile products and the question
of whether decompostion is coupled to the ﬂame chemistry as well as thermal feedback.

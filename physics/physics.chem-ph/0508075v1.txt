Abstract

DFT (density functional theory) anharmonic force ﬁelds with basis sets near the Kohn-

Sham limit have been obtained for perchloric acid, HClO4, and perchloric anhydride, Cl2O7.

Calculated fundamental frequencies are in very good agreement with available experimental data.

Some reassignments in the vibrational spectra of Cl2O7 are proposed based on our calculations.

HClO4 and Cl2O7 are particularly severe examples of the ‘inner polarization’ phenomenon. The

polarization consistent basis sets pc-1 and pc-2 (as well as their augmented counterparts) should

be supplemented with two (preferably three) and one (preferably two) high-exponent d functions,

respectively, on second-row atoms. Complete anharmonic force ﬁelds are available as electronic

supporting information[1].

I.

INTRODUCTION

Perchloric acid, HClO4, was ﬁrst discovered nearly two centuries ago[2].

Its Raman

spectra (and that of its anhydride Cl2O7) were ﬁrst studied by Fonteyne[3] in the 1930s, who

correctly concluded that the Cl2O7 molecule has a bridged structure but wrongly deduced

C3v symmetry for HClO4. Other early experimental spectroscopic work on these systems is

reviewed by Karelin et al.[4] for HClO4, and by Witt and Hammaker[5] for Cl2O7.

Higher chlorine oxides have recently been implicated in theories of stratospheric

destruction of ozone[6]. Despite the molecules’ obvious importance, however, there have

been rather few spectroscopic studies of them. The reason for the dearth of such studies is

probably best illustrated by the following quote from Ref.[5]:

Caution! Several explosions occurred during the course of this work. It was

necessary to perform all experiments wearing heavy gloves and a face shield with

the sample properly shielded.

Clearly, purely computational approaches do not entail such hazards. In recent years,

and following the pioneering study of Dressler and Thiel[7], DFT (density functional theory)

has been considered by a number of groups as a cost-eﬀective alternative for the calculation

of molecular anharmonic force ﬁelds of medium-sized polyatomics. We cite, for instance, the

work of Handy and coworkers on benzene[8] as well as on furan, pyrrole and thiophene[9],

as well as simultaneous and independent studies by the group of Barone[10] and the

present authors[18] on the azabenzene series. Validation studies for a number of molecular

anharmonic force ﬁelds were carried out simultaneously and independently by Barone and

coworkers[13, 14, 15, 16, 17] and by Boese, Klopper, and Martin[18, 19].

As pointed out before[19, 20, 21, 22] — both ab initio[20, 21] and DFT[19, 20, 22]

— basis set convergence in second-row compounds with a second-row atom in a high

oxidation state presents a special challenge due to strong inner polarization eﬀects. (The

eﬀect has sometimes, e.g.,[23, 24], been referred to as ‘inner-shell polarization’, but in

fact can be shown to persist if the inner-shell orbitals are entirely replaced by eﬀective

core potentials.[25]. Initially it was attributed to hypervalence[20], but then shown[23] to

occur in diatomic molecules that cannot plausibly be considered hypervalence. Alternative

explanations that have been advanced include hypervalence[20], polarization of the inner

loops of the (3s,3p) valence orbitals[24], and improvement of the ability of the (3d) Rydberg

2

orbital to accept backdonation from lone pairs of the surrounding atoms[25].) We will show

that the subjects of the present study, perchloric acid (HClO4) and perchloric anhydride

(Cl2O7), are particularly extreme examples. We will also show that, even for a diﬃcult

‘inorganic’ molecule like Cl2O7, DFT anharmonic force ﬁelds can be quite useful in analyzing

and assigning vibrational spectra.

The relationship between the present subject and the work of Dr. Jean Demaison,

who is being honored by this special issue,

is twofold. On the one hand, one of his

research interests over the years has been high-resolution IR spectroscopy on second-row

compounds, such as SiHF3[26], FPO[27], FPS[28], HNSO[29], SO2F2[30], and many others,

as well as ab initio and DFT electronic structure studies on such systems (e.g.,[31, 32])

and combined theoretical-experimental studies (e.g., on allyl phosphine[33]). On the other

hand, Dr. Demaison and one of the present authors are fellow members in a IUPAC Task

Group on the thermochemistry of radicals and other transient atmospheric and combustion

species[34]. The title molecules are clearly relevant to this subject, and a somewhat accurate

set of spectroscopic constants is indispensable for thermochemistry, particularly at elevated

temperatures.

II. COMPUTATIONAL DETAILS

All calculations were run on the Linux farm (Intel Xeon and AMD Opteron) of the Martin

group at the Weizmann Institute of Science.

Following the approach ﬁrst proposed by Schneider and Thiel[35], a full cubic and

semidiagonal quartic force ﬁeld (all that is required for second-order rovibrational

perturbation theory) are obtained by central numerical diﬀerentiation (in rectilinear normal

coordinates about the equilibrium geometry) of analytical second derivatives. The latter
were obtained by means of locally modiﬁed versions of gaussian 03[36]; modiﬁed routines
from cadpac[37] were used as the driver for the numerical diﬀerentiation routine.

All the force ﬁelds have been analyzed by means of the spectro[38] and by polyad[39]

rovibrational perturbation theory programs developed by the Handy group and by Martin,

respectively.

A pruned (140×974) quadrature grid was used, being the pruned direct product of a

140-point Euler-Maclaurin radial grids[40] and a 974-point Lebedev angular grid[41]. For

3

the CPKS (coupled-perturbed Kohn-Sham) steps, we used a diﬀerent, signiﬁcantly coarser

(75×194) grid.

It has been shown (e.g.,[18]) that this will aﬀect computed fundamental

The steps are done along the unnormalized Cartesian displacement vector of the mass

weighted normal coordinates.

We have furthermore tightened convergence criteria at all stages of the electronic structure
calculations to 10−10 or better (no convergence could be achieved with even tighter criteria).

The basis sets employed belong to the polarization consistent family of Jensen[42, 43,

44, 45]. Since bonding in the species investigated is highly ionic in character, (diﬀuse

function) augmented basis sets[44] were employed. We thus considered the aug-pc1, aug-

pc2, and aug-pc3 basis sets, which are of 3s2p, 4s3p2d, and 6s5p3d2f quality, respectively,

on hydrogen, of 4s3p2d, 5s4p3d2f , and 7s6p5d3f 2g quality, respectively, on oxygen, and

of 5s4p2d, 6s5p3d2f , and 7s6p5d3f 2g quality, respectively, on chlorine.

In addition, we

considered aug-pcm+nd basis sets, in which n high-exponent d functions were added in an

even-tempered series with stride factor 2.5 and starting from the highest-exponent d function

in the underlying basis set.

Finally, the exchange-correlation functional employed is B97-1, which is the Handy group

reparametrization[46] of the Becke 1997 exchange-correlation functional. Our validation

studies[18, 19] showed that, of the wide variety of functionals considered, B97-1 generally

yields the best performance for harmonic and fundamental frequencies, marginally better

than the very popular B3LYP functional.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

A. Basis set convergence in binding energies, geometries and harmonic frequencies

Geometries in Cartesian coordinates at all levels of theory can be downloaded as electronic

supporting information to this paper[1]. Our best geometries (B97-1/aug-pc3+d) are given

in Figure 1. Some salient bond distances are given in Table I.

4

Inner polarization eﬀects are particularly egregious for the central Cl–O–Cl bond distance
in Cl2O7: we see a diﬀerence of no less than 0.083 ˚A between aug-pc1 and our largest basis

set (aug-pc3+d). Adding a single tight d function to Cl (resulting in the aug-pc1+d basis
set) reduces the diﬀerence by 0.042 ˚A. This is not nearly converged, however: the second
and third tight d function shave oﬀ another 0.014 and 0.004 ˚A, respectively. The eﬀect of the

fourth tight d is an order of magnitude smaller, indicating that convergence is reached. The
diﬀerence between aug-pc1+4d and aug-pc3+d comes down to a not unreasonable 0.021 ˚A.
Expanding the underlying basis set to aug-pc2, we still ﬁnd a contraction by 0.008 ˚A
upon adding the ﬁrst d function, and by an additional 0.002 ˚A upon adding the second. The

third tight d function’s eﬀect is negligible. The diﬀerence with our largest basis set then
stands at 0.0012 ˚A, indicating satisfactory basis set convergence. (The aug-pc3 vs. aug-
pc3+d diﬀerential is only a paltry 0.0002 ˚A; consequently, no further basis set expansion

was considered.)

As noted repeatedly[21, 22, 49], this type of eﬀect on the geometry goes hand in hand

with an inordinate basis set sensitivity of the computed total atomization energy, although

Cl2O7 is, to the authors’ knowledge, the most extreme example ever reported. Adding

four tight d functions to the aug-pc1 basis set increases the total atomization energy by

no less than 100 (!) kcal/mol, individual contributions decreasing as 62:31:6:1. For the

aug-pc2 basis set, the ﬁrst added tight d still has an eﬀect of almost 15 kcal/mol, followed

by 3.5 kcal/mol for the second and then decaying rapidly. The contribution of a tight d to

aug-pc3, 0.35 kcal/mol, is insigniﬁcant compared to the intrinsic error in DFT atomization

energies. Overall basis set convergence in the aug-pc{1,2,3} sequence changes from a quite

unsatisfactory {302.2,411.0,429.7} kcal/mol sequence without added tight d functions to a

rather more pleasing {402.0,428.4,430.0} kcal/mol.

Eﬀects for the ClO distances in the ClO3 groups are not much less severe: the aug-pc1 –
aug-pc2 – aug-pc3 basis set increments of about 0.05 and 0.01 ˚A, respectively, decrease by

a factor of ﬁve in the aug-pc1+4d — aug-pc2+3d — aug-pc3+d sequence.

Findings for the ClO3 moiety in HClO4 are similar, while those for the OCl distance in

the HOCl moeity parallel the central OCl distances in Cl2O7 in their severity. As one might

expect, the HO distance is not greatly aﬀected.

As one could reasonably expect, inner polarization eﬀects on the total atomization energy

of HClO4 are roughly half the size of the corresponding eﬀects in Cl2O7.

5

The largest eﬀect in the harmonic frequencies will once more be seen in the ClO stretching

modes. The four such frequencies in HClO4 are tabulated in Table II: a complete set of

harmonic frequencies with all basis sets can once again be found as supporting information[1].
As one can see there, 1 cm−1 convergence in harmonic frequencies requires at least three

tight d functions for aug-pc1 (preferably four), and two for aug-pc2, while none are required
for aug-pc3. Tight d functions aﬀect the aug-pc1 ClO stretches in the 90–130 cm−1 range,
compared to 8–20 cm−1 for aug-pc2. We are not merely dealing with a systematic upward

shift: for instance, the splitting between the two lower stretches in the ClO3 moeity increases
from 1 to 49 cm−1 for the aug-pc1 basis set, and from 44 to 55 cm−1 for aug-pc2, with

concomitant shifts of intensity from the lower to the upper mode. The situation gets more

problematic, if anything, for Cl2O7, where the lowest stretches interpenetrate with the upper

bending frequencies, and the presence or absence of inner polarization functions indeed

aﬀects the ordering of bands.

HClO4 and Cl2O7 thus far appear to represent the most extreme cases of inner polarization

encountered in the literature. Clearly, pc-1 and aug-pc1 (and to a lesser extent, pc-2 and

aug-pc2) basis sets should not be used in unmodiﬁed form for second-row compounds where

a second-row atom ﬁnds itself in a high oxidation state. The pc-3 basis set, which already

contains suﬃciently high-exponent d functions, appears to be immune to the problem.

B. Anharmonic force ﬁeld and comparison with earlier computational studies

1. Cl2O7

A complete anharmonic force ﬁeld using the aug-pc3+d basis

set would be

computationally intractable with available equipment: also, anharmonicities are fairly small.

Therefore, we combined a B97-1/aug-pc1+2d quartic force ﬁeld with the B97-1/aug-pc3+d

geometry and harmonic frequencies.

As expected, the anharmonicity constants involving the two low-lying torsion modes are

physically unrealistic when determined by second-order rovibrational perturbation theory:

we have therefore decoupled those two modes from the remainder by zeroing all oﬀ-diagonal

anharmonicity constants involving them. A mild Fermi type 2 resonance ν16 + ν18 ≈ ν3 was

detected and taken into account.

6

Experimental work on the vibrational spectra of Cl2O7 is quite limited: the most complete

experimental reference appears to be the work of Witt and Hammaker[5].

The only previous computational study on the vibrational spectrum of Cl2O7 that we

are aware of is the work of Parthiban et al.[51]. These authors calculated HF/6-31G*

harmonic frequencies and carried out a potential energy distribution analysis in terms of

symmetry coordinates. Their calculated frequencies are in fair agreement with the observed

IR spectrum of Witt and Hammaker[5]. Both sets of data are compared with our best

computed harmonic and fundamental frequencies in Table III.

Agreement between our computed fundamentals and experiment for the bands where the

assigment is clear is too good to be merely coincidental: in general, we can expect agreement
to within 20 cm−1. Trying our hand at assigning the spectra summarized in Table 1 of Witt

and Hammaker, we arrive at a considerably diﬀerent assignment from those proposed by

Witt and Hammaker (based on a simple empirical force ﬁeld) and by Parthiban. A single

glance should suﬃce to see that our (fairly high-level) force ﬁeld has a very diﬀerent structure

from theirs. This illustrates the dangers of attempting to assign complex spectra based on

low-level ab initio calculations or crude empirical force ﬁelds.

2. HClO4

As this molecule is smaller to begin with, and anharmonicity eﬀects are rather more

important here (particularly for vibrations involving the H atom), we have calculated the

anharmonic portion of the force ﬁeld with a larger aug-pc2+2d basis set. Once again,

the B97-1/aug-pc3+d geometry and harmonic frequencies were subsituted in the 2nd order

rovibrational perturbation theory analysis. And similar to Cl2O7, the torsion mode was

decoupled from the remaining ones in the analysis. No Fermi resonances suﬃciently severe

to require explicit treatment were detected.

There is a high-resolution IR study[50] which reports ν5=726.99697(5) cm−1 for H35ClO4
and 725.26209(9) cm−1 for H37ClO4. (For comparison, our calculated fundamental is 711
cm−1.) A number of lower-resolution studies have been reviewed and summarized by

Karelin[4, 54].

Francisco[53] found fairly good agreement between his computed MP2/6-31G(2d,2p)

frequencies and the expt. data of Gigu`ere and Savoie[52]. Karelin[4, 54] noted that some of

7

the bands assigned to HClO4 by these latter two authors actually belong to Cl2O7 impurities.

As shown in Table IV, the Karelin data agree quite well with our calculated anharmonic

frequencies, except of course for the low torsion band which was not observed experimentally.

The large discrepancy between the frequencies of Francisco and ourselves for the low

torsion mode puzzled us. Upon recalculation at the same level of theory as used by Francisco,

MP2/6-31G(2d,2p), we found that we are unable to reproduce his data. The recalculated

frequencies agree as well as expected with our large basis set DFT data.

Oberhammer and coworkers[55] obtained a computed geometry from a combination of

gas electron diﬀraction, microwave spectroscopy, and (to ﬁx the diﬀerence between the

two unique ClO distances in the ClO3 group) ab initio calculations. Our geometry agrees

(Table V) as well with theirs as can be expected considering the limitations of the respective

computational and experimental techniques. For the beneﬁt of future experimental workers,

we have included anharmonic zero-point corrections to the geometry in Table V.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

We may draw the following conclusions:

• DFT anharmonic force ﬁelds are a relatively cost-eﬀective way to assign vibrational

spectra of medium-sized polyatomics

• some reassignments of the vibrational spectrum of Cl2O7 may be in order

• HClO4 and Cl2O7 are particularly severe examples of the ‘inner polarization’

phenomenon. Consideration of previous results[19, 22] as well as unpublished data

by our group on SF6 and PF5, suggests that there is a positive correlation between

the oxidation state of the central second-row atom atom in a molecule (or group) and

the severity of the phenomenon

• the pc1 and pc2 basis sets (as well as their augmented counterparts) should not be

used in unmodiﬁed form for systems liable to be aﬀected by this phenomenon. We

recommend the addition of two (preferably three) high-exponent d functions to second-

row atoms in the pc1 basis set, and one (preferably two) such function(s) for the pc2

basis set.

8

It is often assumed that basis set convergence in DFT is not a very important issue, and that

”push-button” standard basis sets suﬃce. While the absence of an explicit interelectronic

cusp does mean DFT basis set convergence is a much less acute problem than in correlated ab

initio methods (and in fact fairly similar to Hartree-Fock theory in that regard), considerable

basis set dependence remains[56, 57]. And in fact, any serious basis set convergence issue

that shows up at the Hartree-Fock level — such as inner polarization[21] — will also be seen

in DFT. Cl2O7 and HClO4 are just particularly dramatic examples thereof.

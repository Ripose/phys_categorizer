A continuously operated electrostatic trap for polar molecules is demonstrated. The trap has a
volume of ≈ 0.6 cm3 and holds molecules with a positive Stark shift. With deuterated ammonia
−3 is achieved with an average lifetime
from a quadrupole velocity ﬁlter, a trap density of ≈ 108 cm
of 130 ms and a motional temperature of ≈ 300 mK. The trap oﬀers good starting conditions for
high-precision measurements, and can be used as a ﬁrst stage in cooling schemes for molecules and
as a “reaction vessel” in cold chemistry.

The production of cold polar molecules attracts consid-
erable interest, not only in atomic and molecular physics
but also in chemical physics and physical chemistry. Dif-
ferent methods have been developed in recent years to
obtain cold samples of polar alkali dimers [1, 2, 3, 4],
molecules with a magnetic moment such as CaH [5],
and polar molecules with a large and linear Stark shift
like metastable CO [6], ND3 [7, 8, 9, 10], OH [11] and
H2CO [12]. These samples can be trapped in inhomo-
geneous magnetic, electric or optical ﬁelds. Here, trap-
ping is deﬁned as the ability to store the particles much
longer than the time it would take them to leave the trap
volume in the absence of the trapping potential. Typical
experiments employ pulsed loading of the trap, but accu-
mulative methods, in which the sample is produced in the
trap center, have been proposed [13]. Such continuously
operated traps would be advantageous for high-precision
measurements or metrology where long continuous obser-
vation times with samples under constant conditions are
required.

In this Letter we report on a novel electrostatic trap
for polar molecules, which is continuously loaded from an
electrostatic quadrupole guide [12]. The trap works along
electrostatic principles already proposed a long time ago
[14]. It conﬁnes low-ﬁeld-seeking molecules in a region
with low electric ﬁeld strength, surrounded by a region
with a high electric ﬁeld. The trap is experimentally
demonstrated with deuterated ammonia (ND3), but can
be used for all molecules with a suﬃciently large Stark
eﬀect. As shown in Fig. 1 a), the trap consists of ﬁve
ring-shaped electrodes and two spherical electrodes at
both ends. Neighboring electrodes carry high voltages of
diﬀerent polarity giving rise to an inhomogeneous electric
ﬁeld, illustrated in Fig. 1 b), which is large near the elec-
trodes and small in the center of the trap. The central
ring electrode is intersected two times and local thicken-
ing of the neighboring electrodes towards the gaps makes
it possible to adapt two quadrupole segments, one for
ﬁlling and one for extraction of the trapped gas. The

output quadrupoles. For a better view, a part of the trap
electrodes on the right is cut away. The quadrupole guide ﬁl-
ters slow molecules from the cooled eﬀusive source and guides
them into the trap. Here the slowest molecules reside till they
ﬁnd their way out through one of the two quadrupole guides.
The trapped gas is analyzed with a mass spectrometer posi-
tioned behind the output quadrupole. (b) Electric ﬁeld dis-

inner radii of the ﬁve ring electrodes are (2.0; 4.3; 4.8;
4.3; 2.0) mm and the two end electrodes have a diameter
of 2 mm. The electrodes are separated by a 1 mm gap
0.6 cm3. With
and the enclosed volume amounts to
the present setup, a voltage diﬀerence of 10 kV between
neighboring trap electrodes can be reached. This re-
40 kV/cm which the
sults in a minimum electric ﬁeld of
molecules need to overcome in order to escape the trap
in regions away from the small entrance and exit holes.
At these electric ﬁelds, only guided molecules with veloc-

≈

≈

ities below
30 m/s can be kept within the trap where
the maximum capture velocity depends on the Stark shift
of the individual molecule.

≈

Once inside the trap, the molecules are reﬂected from
the high electric ﬁelds close to the electrodes and, bounc-
ing to and fro, their motion is randomized. Those
molecules which can overcome the Stark potential bar-
rier of the trap are either lost by hitting the electrodes or
they escape the trap and are pumped away. The reﬂected
molecules will bounce around until they ﬁnd the entrance
or exit hole. As the trap surface is large compared to the
exit channel area given by the two quadrupolar open-
ings, the probability of ﬁnding these holes is small and
can even be made arbitrary small by making the trap
volume and/or the electric ﬁeld larger. Even though the
trap allows continuous ﬁlling, continuous accumulation
is, of course, not possible in this conservative potential,
and the trap density will equilibrate when the ﬁlling rate
equals the leak-out rate.

In our experiment, the trap is ﬁlled with ND3 from a
quadrupole velocity ﬁlter as detailed in [10].
In brief,
molecules from a thermal reservoir are loaded into a
quadrupolar electric ﬁeld guide via an appropriate noz-
zle assembly. The quadrupole potential provides ﬁlter-
ing of the slowest molecules in the transverse direction
whereas the longitudinal ﬁltering is achieved by the cen-
tripetal action in a bent part of the guide between the
nozzle and the trap. With this technique, a continuously
guided ﬂux of the order of 1010 s−1 can be achieved for
quadrupole voltages of
5 kV, resulting in a maximum
electric ﬁeld of
90 kV/cm. The guided ﬂux consists of
a mixture of states with diﬀerent Stark shifts, and the
longitudinal velocity distribution can be described by a
one-dimensional thermal distribution with a most proba-
ble velocity of
40 m/s. Due to the two-dimensional con-
ﬁnement at ﬁnite ﬁeld strengths, the transversal velocity
distribution is expected to be much narrower. Note that
the internal state distribution of the guided molecules is
enriched by states with a large Stark shift.

As the average electric ﬁeld inside the quadrupole is
higher than inside the trap, the molecules are acceler-
ated when entering the trap. It follows that molecules
with very low velocities are absent in the trap. The
properties of the trapped sample are revealed by the
molecules which leave the trap through the 17 cm long
output quadrupole. Here, the molecules are guided
through a diﬀerential pumping aperture into a separate
vacuum chamber where they are detected by a mass spec-
trometer (MS). Both the input and output quadrupole
guides are separated by a 0.5 mm gap from a short
piece of a quadrupole guide formed from the trap elec-
trodes. This separation allows independent switching of
the quadrupole segments. The background pressure in
the trap chamber is of the order of 10−10 mbar and even
lower in the detection chamber.

In a ﬁrst trapping experiment, voltages of

4.5 kV were

is switched. The electrodes carry voltages of ±4.5 kV. (b) De-
convoluted detector signals as a function of time for diﬀerent

the output is switched oﬀ at t=1 s. The trap dynamics is
revealed by rapidly switching the voltage on one small ring
electrode from 4.5 kV to 0, 2 and 4.5 kV, respectively, after ﬁn-
ishing the ﬁlling process in order to create an artiﬁcial hole in
the trap. When the particular electrode is set to 0 kV a clear
signal loss can be observed, whereas the slow decay caused
by trapped molecules becomes dominant for higher voltages
when the trap hole is closed. The signal trace obtained with
output oﬀ serves as a reference.

back every 2 s. The eﬀusive source temperature was set
to a constant value of 160 K. Fig 2(a) shows a raw trap-
ping signal obtained after averaging over 4000 cycles.
When the input quadrupole is switched on at t=0, slow
molecules are guided and the trap is ﬁlled resulting in an
increasing signal at the output quadrupole guide. After
the input quadrupole is switched oﬀ at t=1 s, a signal
decay is observed which allows to estimate the lifetime
of the molecules in the trap. However, we found that the
rising and the falling slope are signiﬁcantly disturbed by
a pronounced signal even 500 ms after switching on or
oﬀ the input quadrupole. At that time it is expected
that the ﬁlling and emptying of the trap, respectively, is
completed so that steady-state conditions are reached.
Hence, a change of the output ﬂux cannot be caused
by the molecules. At the rising slope, the excess sig-
nal might be caused by a local pressure increase near the
detector after switching on the guiding process. These
molecules must be pumped away after switching oﬀ the

input guide, an eﬀect which leads to a time-dependent
signal at the falling slope. These spurious signals can be
measured by switching on and oﬀ the output quadrupole
while the trap is continuously ﬁlled: As soon as the out-
put guide is switched oﬀ, a rapid decay of the MS signal
to the background level is expected, only limited by the
time the molecules that already left the guide need to
ﬂy to the detector, typically less than 1.0 ms. Indeed, a
fast decay can be observed but it is accompanied by a
slow decay with a 1/e-time of
150 ms. Assuming that
the guided ﬂux into the detector is a sharp step function
Θ(t), the measured signal SΘ(t) is used to determine the
deconvolution kernel, F(K) = F(Θ(t))/F(SΘ(t)), where
F denotes the Fourier transform. For determining the
lifetime of the molecules in the trap, the measured de-
cay signal, SD(t), is deconvoluted by the transformation
F(K)], where F−1 de-
S(t) = SD(t)
notes the inverse Fourier transform. After deconvolution
the slow rise and fall of the signal 500 ms after switching
on and oﬀ the input guide vanishes.

Having described the deconvolution process, we now
discuss the trap measurements in which the input
quadrupole is periodically switched. In order to demon-
strate that the decay rate originates from the trap dy-
namics, an artiﬁcial hole was created in the trap by
rapidly lowering the voltage on one small ring electrode to
a constant value when the input quadrupole and accord-
ingly the ﬁlling process is switched oﬀ. Fig. 2(b) shows
the decay signals after deconvolution for reduced voltages
on the particular ring electrode of 0, 2 and 4.5 kV, respec-
tively. In the decay measurement where the voltage has
been switched to 0 kV, a fast decay can be observed fol-
lowed by a small and slow decay contribution. The fast
decay is caused by the losses due to the weaker ﬁeld near
the particular ring electrode. The molecules causing the
slow decay are either too slow to overcome even the weak
ﬁeld potential barrier or they do not encounter the weak
ﬁeld on their way inside the trap. Note that the start
of the decay is delayed by the time the molecules need
to pass through the output quadrupole. When the volt-
age on the ring electrode is raised to 2.0 kV, the loss rate
decreases which leads to a reduction of the fast decay
contribution whereas the slow decay caused by molecules
which are trapped longer is more pronounced. For the
remaining curve the voltage on the electrode is set to
4.5 kV and here the slow decay is dominant.

Note that the initial fast decay can always be observed.
Simulations show that this decay is caused by a class of
molecular trajectories which approximately are conﬁned
in the plane deﬁned by the middle ring electrode. As both
exit channels lie in this plane a fast escape is very proba-
ble. For those molecules whose trajectories ﬁll the whole
trap volume the escape probability is reduced leading to
a longer trapping time. As the lifetime of the molecules
in the trap depends on how fast they ﬁnd an exit, the
lifetime is velocity dependent. Therefore, the decay can-
not be described by an exponential function and, hence,
not by a (1/e)-lifetime. An alternative measure for the

of 130

±

The lifetime is mainly limited by the exit channels
whereas collisions with the background gas do not con-
tribute signiﬁcantly. As the ﬁeld vanishes only at some
regions in the center of the trap, Majorana transitions
to nontrapping Stark levels are not very likely. With
the angle distribution of the guided molecules behind
the output quadrupole and the sensitivity of the MS the
total ﬂux emerging from the trap can be determined.
From the measured angle distribution it has been de-
termined that only 15 percent of the guided ﬂux reaches
the detector. As the detector sensitivity is of the order
of 10−4 counts/molecule the guided ﬂux from the trap

Similar trapping results were obtained with formaldehyde
(CH2O) and methylchloride (CH2Cl) which also show a
linear Stark eﬀect. Furthermore, it has been observed
that for a molecule with a linear Stark shift the guided
ﬂux from the trap shows a quadratic dependence on the
applied electric ﬁeld [10, 12]. This proves that the states
contributing to the signal have a linear Stark shift. It fol-
lows that the occurrence of diﬀerent Stark shifts in the
guide and the trapped gas is a conserved quantity, in-
dependent on how deep the limiting electric ﬁeld value
ﬁlters the original velocity distribution.

FIG. 3: Velocity distribution of trapped ND3 molecules de-
rived from data obtained with electrode voltages of ± 4.5 kV
(squares). The line is a ﬁt to the measured data of the func-
tional form (2v/α2) exp[−v2/α2], with the characteristic lon-
gitudinal velocity α = 16.6 ± 1 m/s. The triangles denote
simulation results.

In the following the temperature of the trapped ND3
sample is determined by a measurement of the molecules’
velocity distribution. Therefore, a time-of-ﬂight mea-
surement is performed where the trap is continuously
ﬁlled and only the output quadrupole is switched on and
oﬀ at rate 1 Hz. All electrodes were set to voltages of
4.5 kV. As soon as the output quadrupole is switched
±
on, molecules from the trap are guided to the detector
where their arrival time is recorded. After more than
50,000 cycles a clear time-of-ﬂight signal has developed.
From the delay and the rising slope the longitudinal ve-
locity distribution can be derived by diﬀerentiation. For
a single molecular state, the velocity distribution should

±

show a relatively sharp velocity cut-oﬀ because the guide
and the trap ﬁlter on kinetic energy. But given a mixture
of states with diﬀerent Stark shifts, the cut-oﬀ is smeared
out so that the velocity distribution can be described by
a one-dimensional thermal distribution. As the time-of-
ﬂight signal is aﬀected by the above-mentioned spurious
signal, the measured signal was deconvoluted according
to the method described above. Fig. 3 shows the velocity
distribution obtained from the deconvoluted data. It can
be described by a characteristic velocity α = 16
1 m/s
with α=p2kBT /m, where kB is the Boltzmann constant,
T the temperature and m the molecular mass. The char-
acteristic velocity α is equivalent to the most probable
speed of a thermal gas in a three-dimensional volume el-
ement. This velocity corresponds to a motional temper-
ature of 300 mK. Note that the lowest velocity molecules
may be partially depleted by collisions in the nozzle
where the densities are relatively high. Note also that the
molecular velocities in the output quadrupole are slightly
smaller than inside the trap because the molecules are
decelerated when entering the higher quadrupole ﬁeld.
However, as there are only conservative potentials in-
volved, the temperature of the sample does not change.
The experimental data are in good agreement with the
simulation. As expected, the temperature of 300 mK is
smaller than the trap depth of 800 mK derived from the
average Stark potential.

The transverse velocity distribution of the trapped
molecules can be estimated by recording the decrease of
the ﬂux of guided molecules in the output quadrupole
when the electric ﬁeld in the latter is reduced. During
the measurements, the voltages on the input quadrupole
4.5 kV and the input was mod-
and the trap were set to
ulated. In each measurement the electric ﬁeld in the out-
put quadrupole was set to a diﬀerent but constant value.
It was observed that more than 90% of the ﬂux from the
trap can be guided even if the output quadrupole voltage
750 V so that most of the molecules
is reduced down to
can be two-dimensionally trapped in an electric ﬁeld of
only 15 kV/cm. Below this voltage, the guided ﬂux de-

creases and at voltages of

ple, the initial ﬂux has reduced by a factor of two. The
measured decrease of the signal amplitude as a function
of the output quadrupole voltage is in good agreement
with the simulation of the experiment. This justiﬁes the
assumption that the simulated transverse velocity distri-
bution with its characteristic velocity of αsim = 14 m/s
describes the experiment well. It follows that the char-
acteristic velocity α of the longitudinal distribution is
roughly equal to the characteristic velocity αsim deter-
mined for the transversal velocity distribution, which is
in contrast to the situation in the input quadrupole guide.
There, the longitudinal velocities can be much higher as
longitudinal ﬁltering is less restrictive than transverse
ﬁltering. The trap equally ﬁlters the longitudinal and
the transverse velocities which leads to an equilibration
of the velocity distributions, as is also obtained in the
simulation. With the knowledge of the average speed
¯v = 2α/√π and the total molecular ﬂux Φ out of the
trap, one can estimate the number density n in the trap
by Φ = 1
4 n¯vA where A is the eﬀective area of each of
the two exit channels. From simulations we know that
the molecular density distribution inside the guide with
voltages of
400 µm. Taking
this as the radius of a circular area A and assuming an
average velocity ¯v of 18 m/s, the number density inside
the trap is of the order of 108 cm−3.

To summarize, a continuously loaded,

large-volume
electrostatic trap for polar molecules has been demon-
strated experimentally. Our results show that a sam-
ple of ND3 molecules at a density of 108 cm−3 can be
trapped with a lifetime of 130
10 ms. The trap is ﬁlled
from a quadrupole guide, but it is also conceivable to pro-
duce the trapped molecules inside the trap, for example
by reactive collisions [15], buﬀer gas loading or crossed
molecular beams [16]. A single output guide would then
allow the continuous extraction of the molecules out of
the production region. Provided electrostatic or mechan-
ical valves can be developed, one can even envision a
small cold chemical factory made out of network of in-
terconnected “reaction vessels” with new possibilities in
controlling chemical reactions.

The recently observed transient absorption of the lowest excited state of the special pair P ∗ at
1 [1] is assigned as a singlet which arises from the coupling of the two lowest triplets from the
2710cm−
two dimer halves. INDO calculations are used to predict its intensity. The analogy of the coupling
mechanism to the trip-doublet spectrum from P + is shown and the inﬂuence of the double triplet on
the Stark eﬀect of P ∗ is investigated.

Abstract:

Introduction

1 an interesting spectrum has been observed. A relatively sharp band at 2710cm−

In recent femtosecond infrared spectroscopy of the reaction center excited states of Rb.sphaeroides up
1 is
to 10000cm−
1 [1 ]. These bands have been interpreted as internal charge
followed by a very broad around 5300cm−
transfer states, where the extra broadening of the upper is seen as a result of mixing to higher excited
states of the dimer. This interpretation can not explain that the higher state has more intensity,
also the absence of the lower in the ground state spectrum and in the Stark eﬀect spectrum would
be in conﬂict with this model, since the CT state should mix appreciably with P ∗. From our INDO
calculations which are based on the X-ray structure of rps.viridis we have predicted earlier [ 2 ] the
presence of a low lying excited state denoted P ∗∗ which is a singlet component of a double excited state
with a triplet on each of the two dimer halves. We obtained this state too low in energy as we know
from the predicted energy positions of the lowest triplet. However, if we correct for this shortcoming of
the INDO calculation, we predict this state to be at the position of the newly observed band. For the
symmetric dimer it is an even state and therefore does not couple with P ∗. There exists, however, an
interesting one-electron coupling mechanism to the internal charge transfer states. This coupling is of
the same nature as the one which provides intensity to the trip-doublet observed in the P + spectrum.
P ∗∗ transition obtains its intensity from the CT states.
In this paper we want to show that the P ∗ →
Moreover the presence of the P ∗∗ state helps to understand the unusual Stark eﬀect spectrum of P ∗
and provides insight into the internal asymmetry of the dimer. We start with the analysis of the
spectrum of P +, then we present an extended exciton model for the dimer which includes the CT and
the double-triplet state. Analytical expressions are derived for the infrared transitions and the Stark
eﬀect. The relevant couplings are discussed in the framework of INDO calculations.

Simulation of the P + spectrum

The spectrum of P + [1,3] shows a very low energy transition at

and another transition of similar strength at
transition energy. INDO calculations by us [2] as well as model studies by Breton et al [3] and by

Parson et al [4 ] related the lowest transition to the hole transfer. The higher transition shows more
complex conﬁguration interaction [2]. Recent investigations by Reimers et al [5 ] attributed also the
low energy transition to the hole transfer between the two dimer halves and the higher band to a
trip-doublet state. A quantitative understanding is still missing since the internal asymmetries of the
dimer wich are diﬃcult to assess, inﬂuence the relative intensities in a sensitive way.

Here we want to discuss the experimental spectrum in the framework of a simpliﬁed four state
model which incorporates the two cationic states L+ and M + and the two lowest excitations for each
of them which are the triplet-coupled doublets L+M 3 and M +L3. A more detailed analysis including
higher excited conﬁgurations explicitly will be given in a separate paper .

Within this basis the positive charge is fully localized on PL for the ﬁrst and third state and on
PM for the other two. The delocalization of the charge is the result of the intermolecular resonance
interaction U1 ,U2 competing with the small energy diﬀerences 2d1,2 of the symmetry related states.
Such asymmetries arise from asymmetric interaction with the surrounding, e.g. hydrogen bonding to
protein residues or from asymmetries of the two chromophores. We investigated especially the inﬂuence
of the orientation of the two acetyl groups. A structure model where the oxygen and the methyl group
of PM are exchanged is also consistent with the X-ray structure and leads to a large splitting of the
intradimer charge transfer states which is needed to explain the strong dipole change of P ∗ seen in
the Stark spectrum. The two couples of states denoted by the indices 1 and 2 respectively interact
via the matrixelements U12 and U21. A detailed analysis of the INDO results shows that the coupling
U1 is mainly given by the negative resonance interaction
βLM involving the molecular orbitals of
two diﬀerent charged states P +
M . For our analysis we want to interpret couplings for P + and
P ∗ within one set of molecular orbitals. We use localized SCF orbitals of the neutral dimer which
are obtained switching oﬀ all resonance interactions between the two dimer halves during the SCF
step. Electron correlation eﬀects are important and the expression for U1 becomes more complicated
as conﬁguration mixing takes place. We ﬁnd that U1 is underestimated by about a factor of 2 if the
resonance integral βLM of the SCF orbitals of P is used. For the coupling of the two trip-doublet
states the reorganization eﬀect is of little importance. The couplings of the lowest cationic states to
the trip-doublets involve the transfer of an electron from the HOMO on one side to the LUMO on the
other side. Here the reorganization eﬀect leads to a signiﬁcant increase of U12 and U21. These rather
strong couplings induce the intensity of the trip-doublets. The results are summarized in table 1
For a simpliﬁed analytical treatment we ﬁrst diagonalize the two pairs of states with their asymmetries
which we want to determine empirically. The couplings U12 and U21 are treated as a perturbation.

diﬀerence of 7000cm−
of the coupling by a factor of 2 already gives more intensity for the trip-doublets than for the hole
transfer band. The distribution of intensity over the two trip-doublet transitions depends on their
degree of localization. In case of full localization of the lower trip-doublet on PM the intensity ratio
of 2:1 is essentially given by the localization of the lowest doublets.
If on the other hand the two
trip-doublets form a pair of completely delocalized states which might be a reasonable assumption as
the resonance coupling U2 is larger in magnitude than U1, the lower of the trip-doublet transitions
gains about sin2(φ1 + π

enlarged due to energy diﬀerences of the triplet states on the L and M halves. In our INDO calculations
we found a rather small asymmetry only if we used the structure with the rotated acetyl on the M-half.
Experimentally it is not possible to assign this state clearly which supports the conjecture of strong
delocalization and the resulting low intensity. This conclusion diﬀers from the assumptions made by
Reimers and Hush [ 5 ]. If the trip-doublets borrow their intensity predominantly from the hole transfer
band they will be essentially both polarized parallel to the vector p. This polarization is consistent
with the experimental anisotropy of 0.298
0.028 [1]. From the quantum calculations we ﬁnd a value
of 0.27. We like to point to the fact that the magnitude and direction of p are largely inﬂuenced by
the reorganisation of the electron system. For a transition parallel to the direction connecting the two
magnesium atoms the calculated anisotropy has a much smaller value of 0.21. On the basis of this
assumption Wynne et al [1] concluded that the intensity of the trip-doublet is not provided by the
hole transfer. Instead they assume that the trip-doublet has the polarization of the Qy transition of
PM . The transition to the trip-doublet gains its intensity from the one-particle interaction between
the two dimer halves as discussed by Reimers et al. A detailed analysis will be given in a forthcoming
paper which shows that the transition dipole contains a contribution from the hole transfer transition
and a smaller one from the Qy transitions of the two halves, the latter depending on the degree of

Interpretation of the P ∗ spectrum

The electronic structure of the dimer in the Qy region is expected to show at least four states which are
mixtures of two local excitations P ∗L and P ∗M and of two charge transfer states L+M − and M +L−. The
P ∗M with some admixture
lowest excitation is mainly ascribed to the antisymmetric combination P ∗L −
of the charge transfer states. This excitation carries most of the Qy oscillator strength as the transition
dipoles of the two dimer halves are nearly antiparallel. The second excitonic component , the so called
upper dimer band carries much less intensity and overlaps with the absorption bands of the accessory
monomers. From the absence of a strong Stark eﬀect in this region it was concluded [8] that the
upper dimer band couples only weakly to the CT states. The CT states are predicted to be in the
region between the upper dimer band and the Qx transitions of the dimer. They cannot be observed
in the absorption spectrum as they have only little intensity and are inhomogeneously broadened by
electrostatic interaction with the environment. In addition to these four basic Qy excitations we now
incorporate an additional excitation in this frequency region which can be visualized as two triplet
excitations on the two halves which are coupled to a singlet double excitation of the dimer. It might

be identiﬁed with the weak band at 15800cm−
INDO results this double-triplet state P ∗∗ couples strongly to the charge transfer states and may be
important for the interpretation of the Stark eﬀect of the dimer absorption. The coupling involves
the transfer of an electron from an occupied orbital to an unoccupied orbital on the other dimer half
and is therefore closely related to the coupling of the trip-doublets to the lowest cationic states. The
energy of this state is underestimated by the INDO method for the applied parameters. As the lowest
1 and the calculated
calculated triplet of the Bchl molecules comes out too low by about 1500cm−
energy of P ∗∗ is close to P ∗ or even slightly below [2,9,10 ] we expect the correct position of P ∗∗
1 above P ∗ which places it at the position of the lower and sharper P ∗
somewhat less than 3000cm−
absorption band of Wynne et al [1]. In the following we want to show that further support for such
an assignment comes from the prediction of its intensity, its width and its Stark eﬀect. We consider
coupling of the following basic excitations: P ∗L,P ∗M , L+M − , M +L− ,P ∗∗ described by the interaction

As the dipole changes ∆p of the isolated chromophores are small, the main contribution of the ﬁrst
three transitions comes from the large dipole moment of the charge transfer states pCT which from
the INDO results has a magnitude of 32 Debye. So we predict for a nearly symmetric dimer that only
the transitions to CT(+) and P ∗∗ should carry signiﬁcant intensities.

Symmetry breaking interactions and Stark eﬀect

Breakage of the C2 symmetry causes a splitting of the two charge transfer states L+M − and M +L−.
Such perturbations easily arise from diﬀerent orientation of the acetyl groups or from asymmetric
interactions with the surrounding , including the local electric ﬁeld. We model the splitting of the two
local CT states by a perturbation operator of the form

Here δ is the perturbation parameter which admixes the states of diﬀerent symmetry. The asym-
metry does not eﬀect in lowest order the intensities of the ﬁrst three transitions in eq. 8. Only the
transition to the fourth state CT(-) will borrow intensity from CT(+) as the two charge transfer states
decouple into the localized states L+M − and M +L−. On the basis of these results we interpret the

by their interaction with the environment. This interpretation is also consistent with the diﬀerent

widths of the two bands. Only a small part of the width of the CT states is transferred. Figure 1b
shows a simulation of the P ∗ spectrum using the calculated couplings from table 2. The energies of
the transitions had to be adjusted slightly to ﬁt the maxima of the experimental spectrum. Using

3 agrees quite reasonably with the observed intensities (ﬁg.1). Further support for this assignment
comes from the Stark spectrum.

1 this leads to an increase of 50% both for the dipole change and

1.
In our INDO calculations such a large splitting resulted only for the acetyl rotated structure.
Interaction with the P ∗∗ state increases the permanent dipole moment by 17% to 6.4Debye. This is
roughly the correct magnitude consistent with our earlier assignment. The analysis of the experimental
spectra, however, is complicated by its shape which contains contributions from the ﬁrst and second
derivative. Figure 1c shows a simulation using the calculated couplings from table 2 and the same
adjusted energies as in ﬁgure 1b. The calculated Stark eﬀect contains a signiﬁcant contribution from
the large polarizability of the dimer which shows up as a ﬁrst derivative. We like to mention that
our model also allows to calculate the higher order polarizabilities which have been investigated in
recent experiments [ 11]. For the absorption changes proportional to the fourth power of the ﬁeld
our calculations predict a mixture of up to the fourth derivative of the absorption spectrum with the
major contribution from the third derivative. These seems to be in qualitative agreement with the
experiment.

Conclusion

Our model calculations strongly suggest that a double-triplet excitation P ∗∗ of the dimer is in the
energy region of the internal charge transfer states and is strongly coupled to them. We identify
1. This interpretation
this state with the narrow band of the experimental P ∗ spectrum at 2700cm−
explains the intensity and the relative small band width as compared to the broad band at higher
energies which is typical for CT excitations. Furthermore mixture of P ∗∗ and the CT states enhances
the Stark eﬀect which helps to explain the experimental data. The relatively strong coupling involves
the transition of an electron from an occupied orbital located on one half to an unoccupied orbital on
the other half. This coupling is largely analogous to the coupling of the lowest cationic state of P +
to a trip-doublet state which has been invoked to explain the experimental P + spectrum. Our INDO
calculations are based on a structure model where the acetyl of PM is rotated by 180o . This way the
proper splitting of the CT states could be obtained.

ﬁgure 1: simulated spectra from the exciton model using the parameters from table 3

(a) the experimental P + spectrum from [3] is compared with the calculated transitions shown as
bars. As compared to the INDO results the HOMO-HOMO coupling has been enlarged by a factor of
1.
1.8 to reproduce the position of the hole transfer band and the doub-triplets are shifted by 2800cm−
(b) the calculated P ∗ spectrum (full curve) is compared with a ﬁt of the experimental data by
two Gaussians (broken curve) as described in [1]. The scale is the same for both curves. The higher
intensity seen experimentally for the lower band could be explained if the coupling of the CT states
to P ∗∗ and P ∗(-) were enlarged as compared to the calculated values.

(c) the calculated Stark eﬀect spectrum (curve) is shown together with the calculated absorption
(reduced by a factor 0.05). The dimer band shows a mixture of ﬁrst and second derivative with the
minimum close to the position of the absorption maximum. The other excited states contribute only
little to the Stark eﬀect. The width of the dimer bands are as in earlier simulations of the room
1 is from INDO results on the M-
temperature spectra. The splitting of the CT states of 4000cm−
acetyl rotated structure. The coupling of P ∗∗ and the CT states is essentially the same as the coupling
between the trip-doublets and the lowest cationic states of the dimer. The diﬀerences in table 3 are
due to diﬀerent reorganization eﬀects.

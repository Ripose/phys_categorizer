ELECTROCHEMICAL THIN FILMS AT AND ABOVE THE
CLASSICAL LIMITING CURRENT

KEVIN T. CHU† AND MARTIN Z. BAZANT†

Abstract. We study a model electrochemical thin ﬁlm at dc currents exceeding the classical
diﬀusion-limited value. The mathematical problem involves the steady Poisson-Nernst-Planck equa-
tions for a binary electrolyte with nonlinear boundary conditions for reaction kinetics and Stern-layer
capacitance, as well as an integral constraint on the number of anions. At the limiting current, we
ﬁnd a nested boundary layer structure at the cathode, which is required by the reaction boundary
condition. Above the limiting current, a depletion of anions generally characterizes the cathode side
of the cell. In this regime, we derive leading-order asymptotic approximations for the (i) classical bulk
space-charge layer and (ii) another, nested highly charged boundary layer at the cathode. The former
involves an exact solution to the Nernst-Planck equations for a single, unscreened ionic species, which
may apply more generally to Faradaic conduction through very thin insulating ﬁlms. By matching
expansions, we derive current-voltage relations well into the space-charge regime. Throughout our
analysis, we emphasize the strong inﬂuence of the Stern-layer capacitance on cell behavior.

Introduction. Thin-ﬁlm technologies oﬀer a promising way to construct

rechargeable micro-batteries, which can be directly integrated into modern electronic
circuits [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. Due to the power-density requirements of many applica-
tions, such as portable electronics, micro-batteries are likely to be operated under
at high current density, possibly exceeding diﬀusion limitation. In a thin ﬁlm, very
large electric ﬁelds are easily produced by applying only small voltages, due to the
small electrode separation, which may be comparable to the Debye screening length.
Under such conditions, the traditional postulates of macroscopic electrochemical sys-
tems [7, 8] — bulk electroneutrality and equilibrium double layers — break down
near the classical diﬀusion-limited current [9]. The mathematical justiﬁcation for
these postulates is based on matched asymptotic expansions in the limit of thin dou-
ble layers [12, 13, 14], which require subtle modiﬁcations at large currents.

The concept of a “limiting current”, due to the maximum, steady-state ﬂux of
diﬀusion across an electrochemical cell, was introduced by Nernst a century ago [10],
but it was eventually realized that the classical theory is ﬂawed, as illustrated in
Figure 1 by numerical solutions to our model problem below. Levich was perhaps
the ﬁrst to notice that the assumption of bulk electroneutrality yields approximate
solutions to the Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) equations, which are not self consistent
near the limiting current, since the predicted charge density eventually exceeds the
salt concentration near the cathode [11]. This paradox was ﬁrst resolved by Smyrl
and Newman, who showed that the double layer expands at the limiting current,
as the Poisson-Boltzmann approximation of thermal equilibrium breaks down [15].
Rubinstein and Shtilman later pointed out that mathematical solutions also exist for
larger currents, well above the classical limiting value, characterized by a region of
non-equilibrium “space charge” extending signiﬁcantly into the neutral bulk [16].

The possiblity of superlimiting currents has been studied extensively in the diﬀer-
ent context of bulk liquid electrolytes, where a thin space-charge layer drives nonlinear

electro-osmotic slip. This phenomenon of “electro-osmosis of the second kind” was
introduced by Dukhin for the nonlinear electrophoresis of ion-selective, conducting col-
loidal particles [17], and Ben and Chang have recently studied it in microﬂuidics [18].
The mathematical analysis of second-kind electro-osmosis using matched asymptotic
expansions, similar to the approach taken here, was ﬁrst developed by Rubinstein
and Zaltzman for related phenomena at electrodialysis membranes [19, 20]. In earlier
studies, the space-charge layer was also invoked by Bruinsma and Alexander [21] to
predict hydrodynamic instability during electrodeposition and by Chazalviel [22] in a
controversial theory of fractal electrochemical growth.

As in our companion paper on sublimiting currents [9], here we consider (typically
solid or gel) thin ﬁlms, e.g. arising in micro-batteries, which approach the classical
limiting current without hydrodynamic instability. At micron or smaller length scales,
the space charge layer need not be “thin” compared to the ﬁlm thickness, so we also
analyze currents well above the classical limiting current, apparently for the ﬁrst
time. In both regimes, close to and far above the classical limiting current, we derive
matched asymptotic expansions for the concentration proﬁles and potential, which
we compare against numerical solutions. In addition to our focus on superlimiting
currents and small systems, a notable diﬀerence with the literature on second-kind
electro-osmosis is our use of nonlinear boundary conditions for Faradaic electron-
transfer reactions, assuming Butler-Volmer kinetics and a compact Stern layer. We
also analyze the current-voltage relation, thus extending our analogous results for thin
ﬁlms below the limiting current [9].

1. Statement of Problem. Before delving into the analysis (and to make this
paper as self-contained as possible), we review governing equations and boundary
conditions. We shall focus solely on the dimensionless formulation of the problem.
For details of the physical assumptions underlying the mathematical model, the reader
is referred to Ref. [9].

Here ǫ is a small dimensionless parameter equal to the ratio of the Debye screening
length to the electrode separation (or ﬁlm thickness). Note that this formulation

eﬃcient, and neglects any variations which may occur at large electric ﬁelds. The

The ﬁrst two boundary conditions, Eqs. (10)–(11), account for the intrinsic capaci-
tance of the compact part of the electrode-electrolyte interface, as originally envisioned
by Stern. In these boundary conditions, δ is a dimensionless parameter which is a
measure of the strength of the surface capacitance, and v is the total voltage drop
across the cell.

The next two boundary conditions, Eqs. (12)–(13), are Butler-Volmer rate equa-
tions which represent the kinetics of Faradaic electron-transfer reactions at each elec-
trode, with an Arhhenius dependence on the compact layer voltage. In these equa-
tions, kc and ır are dimensionless reaction rate constants and αc and αa are transfer
coeﬃcients for the electrode reaction. It is worth noting that αc and αa do not vary
too much from system to system; typically they have values between 0 and 1 and
often both take on values near 1/2.

Finally, the integral constraint, Eq. (14), reﬂects the fact that the total number
of anions is ﬁxed, assuming that anions are not allowed to leave the electrolyte by
Faradaic processes or speciﬁc adsorption. It is important to understand that the need
for an extra boundary condition/constraint reﬂects that the current-voltage relation-
ship, ı(v), or “polarographic curve”, is not given a priori. As usual in one-dimensional
problems [9], it is easier to assume galvanostatic forcing at ﬁxed curent, ı, and then
solve for the cell voltage, v(ı), by applying the boundary condition (11), rather than
the more common case of potentiostatic forcing at ﬁxed voltage, v. For this reason,
we take the former approach in our analysis. For steady-state problems, the two kinds
of forcing are equivalent and yield the same (invertible) polaragraphic curve, ı(v) or
v(ı).

For some of our analysis, it will be convenient to further simplify the problem by
dφ
dx . This transformation is useful
introducing the dimensionless electric ﬁeld, E
because three of the ﬁve independent constraints can be expressed in terms of these
variables, without explicit dependence on φ(x), namely the two Butler-Volmer rate

and the integral constaint on the total number of anions, Eq. (14). The potential is
recovered by integrating the electric ﬁeld and applying the Stern boundary conditions

2.1. Master Equation for the Electrostatic Potential. We begin our anal-
ysis by reducing the governing equations, Eqs. (7) through (9), to a single master
equation for the electrostatic potential. Substituting Eq. (9) into Eq. (7) and inte-

Once this equation is solved, the concentration, c, and charge density, ρ, are computed
using Eq. (17) and Poisson’s equation, Eq. (9).

The master equation has been derived in various equilivalent forms since the
1960s. Grafov and Chernenko [24] ﬁrst combined Eqs. (4), (5) and (9) to obtain a
single nonlinear diﬀerential equation for the anion concentration, c−, whose general
solution they expressed in terms of Painlev´e’s transcendents. The master equation for
the electric ﬁeld, Eq. (20), was ﬁrst derived Smyrl and Newman [15], in the special
case of the classical limiting current, where ı = 1 and c
¯o = 0, where they discovered
a non-equilibrium double layer of width, ǫ2/3, which is apparent from the form of
the master equation. We shall study the general electric-ﬁeld and potential equations
for an arbitrary current, ı, focusing on boundary-layer structure in the limiting and
superlimiting regimes.

2.2. Eﬃcient Numerical Solution. To solve the master equation for the elec-
tric ﬁeld with the boundary conditions and integral constraint, we use the Newton-
Kantorovich method [25]. Speciﬁcally, we use a Chebyshev pseudospectral discretiza-
tion to solve the linearized boundary-value problem at each iteration [25, 26]. Our
decision to use this method is motivated by its natural ability to resolve boundary
layers and its eﬃcient use of grid points. We are able to get accurate results for many
parameter regimes very quickly (typically less than a few minutes on a workstation)
with only a few hundred grid points, which would not be possible at large currents
and/or thin double layers using a naive ﬁnite-diﬀerence scheme. It is important to
stress that the boundary conditions and the integral constraint are explicitly included
as part of the Newton-Kantorovich iteration. Therefore, the linear BVP solved in
each iteration is actually an integro-diﬀerential diﬀerential equation with boundary
conditions that are integro-algebraic equations.

To ensure convergence at high currents, we use continuation in the current density
parameter, ı, and start with a suﬃciently low initial ı that the bulk electroneutral
solution is an acceptable initial guess; often, initial ı values relatively high compared
to the diﬀusion-limited current are acceptable. Continuation in the δ parameter is
also sometimes necessary to compute solutions at high δ values.

The results of the numerical method are presented in the ﬁgures below and in

Ref. [9] to test our analytical approximations obtained by asymptotic analysis.

Unfortunately, at this scale, all terms in Eq. (22) are O(1), so we are forced to solve

totic approximations (dashed and dot-dashed lines) for kc = 1, ır = 2, ǫ = 0.01 and δ = 0.1, 10.
The leading order bulk approximations for E(x) and c(x) are given by Eq. (27) and c(x) = 2ıx,
respectively. In the diﬀuse layer, the leading order approximations are given by Eqs. (29) and
(30). For the δ = 10 curves, the diﬀerence between the dashed and dot-dashed curves is that the
dahsed curve uses an approximate value for B given by Eq. (35) while the dot-dashed curve uses
a B value calculated by numerically solving Eq. (32). For reference, the vertical lines show where
x = ǫ and x = ǫ2/3. The thin anode diﬀuse layer ﬁeld is not shown.

Before moving on, it is worth noting that the asymptotic behavior of the con-

centration and charge density in the Smyrl-Newman layer as z
→ ∞
suggest that the charge density is low throughout the entire Smyrl-Newman layer.
Figure 3 shows how the Smyrl-Newman layer acts as a transition layer allowing the
bulk concentration to become small near the cathode while still ensuring a suﬃciently
high cation concentration at the cathode surface to satisfy the reaction boundary
conditions. The transition nature of the Smyrl-Newman layer becomes even more
pronounced for smaller values of ǫ.

O(1/ǫ). As current exceeds the classical limiting value, the overlap region between
the inner diﬀuse and Smyrl-Newman layers grows to become a layer having O(1)
width. Following other authors [16, 22], we shall refer to this new layer as the “space-
charge” layer because, as we shall see, it has a non-negligible charge density compared
to the rest of the bulk. Therefore, in this current regime, the central region of the
electrochemical cell is split into two pieces having O(1) width separated by a o(1)
transition layer.

In the bulk, the solution remains unchanged except that c

4.1. Structure of the Space-Charge Layer. Physically, we could argue that
the concentration of ions in the space-charge layer is very small (i.e. zero at leading
order) because the layer is essentially the result of stretching the ionic content of the
overlap between the inner diﬀuse and Smyrl-Newman layers, which is small to begin
with, over an O(1) region. This physical intuition is conﬁrmed by the numerical
solutions shown in Figures 4, 5, and 6. Therefore, using Eq. (17), we obtain the
leading order solution for the electric ﬁeld

Note that the magnitude of the ﬁeld is exactly what is required to make the integral

Fig. 6. Numerical solutions (solid lines) for the dimensionless electric ﬁeld E(x), average
concentration c(x), and charge density ρ(x) far above the diﬀusion-limited current (ı = 10.0)
compared with leading order asymptotic approximations (dashed lines) for kc = 1, ır = 2, ǫ = 0.01,
and δ = 0.1. Each ﬁeld is shown twice: (1) with x on log scale to focus on the cathode region
and (2) with x on a linear scale to emphasize the interior of the cell. Note that ıǫ = 0.1, so
the asymptotic approximations are not as good as at lower current densities. For reference, the
vertical lines show where x = ǫ and x = xo.

≪

Note that in this asymptotic series, the ﬁrst term only dominates the second term as
long as ı
1/ǫ, so the following analysis only holds for current densities far below
O(1/ǫ). Figure 6 illustrates the breakdown of the leading-order asymptotic solutions
at very high current densities. While the qualitative features of the asymptotic ap-
proximation are correct (e.g. shape of E(x) in the diﬀuse layer and slope of c(x) in
the bulk), the quality of the approximation is clearly less than at lower values of ı.

The key advantage of a more systematic asymptotic analysis is that we are able to
calculate the leading-order behavior of the space-charge layer concentration ˜c, which
is not possible with only knowledge of the leading order behavior for the electric ﬁeld.

Since c− = c
charge layer is essentially depleted of anions, c− = o(ǫ), as is clearly seen in Figures 4

thin ﬁlms, complete anion deplection might occur. For example, in a microbattery
developed for on-chip power sources using the Li/SiO2/Si system, lithium ion conduc-
tion has recently been demonstrated in nano-scale ﬁlms of silicon oxide, where there
should not be any counter ions or excess electrons [6].

That equivalence of the single-ion equations and the full governing equations
at leading-order mathematically conﬁrms the physically interpretation of the space-
charge layer as a region of anion depletion. From an alternative perspective, it also
reminds us that under extreme conditions, it may be necessary to rethink our assump-
tions about what physical eﬀects are dominant.

4.2. Boundary Layers Above the Limiting Current. To complete our anal-
ysis of the high-current regime, 1 + O(ǫ2/3)
O(1/ǫ), we must consider the
boundary layers. At the anode, all ﬁelds are O(1), so we recover the usual Gouy-
Chapman solution with the minor modiﬁcation that c1 = 2√ı which is the value ¯c
takes as x
1. The cathode structure, however, is much more interesting because
it is depleted of anions (see Figure 5). To our knowledge, this non-equilibrium inner
boundary layer on the space-charge region, related to the reaction boundary condition
at the cathode, has not been analyzed before.

The ﬁrst two terms in this expression estimate the voltage drop across the space-charge
and the cathode Stern layers, respectively. The last two terms are the subdominant
contribution from the bulk where we have somewhat arbitrarily taken x = xo + ǫ2/3 as
the boundary between the bulk layer and the Smyrl-Newman transition layer. Notice
that we ignore the contribution from the cathode diﬀuse and Smyrl-Newman layers.
It is safe to neglect the diﬀuse layer because it is an O(1) contribution. However, the
Smyrl-Newman layer has a non-neglible potential drop that we have to accept as error
since we do not have an analytic form for the solution in that region.

Figure 7 shows that the asymptotic polarographic curves are quite accurate for
suﬃciently small ǫ values. In Table 1, we compare the results predicted by the asymp-
totic formula with numerical results for a few speciﬁc values of ǫ and δ. It is interesting
that the approximation is also better for large δ values (we explain this observation
in the next section). Also, while the log ǫ term is subdominant, it makes a signiﬁcant
contribution to the cell voltage for ǫ values as small as 0.01.

As with the width of the space-charge layer, xo, our expression for the cell volt-
age, Eq. (65), is consistent with the results of Bruinsma and Alexander [21] and
1+, while remaining valid at much larger

6. Eﬀects of the Stern-Layer Capacitance. The inclusion of the Stern layer
in the boundary conditions allows us to explore the eﬀects of the intrinsic surface
capacitance on the structure of the cell. From Figures 3 through 5, we can see that
smaller Stern-layer capacitances (i.e. larger δ values) decrease the concentration and
electric ﬁeld strength in the cathode diﬀuse layer. This behavior arises primarily from
the inﬂuence of the electric ﬁeld on the chemical kinetics at the electrode surfaces.
When the capacitance of the Stern layer is low, small electric ﬁelds at the cathode
surface translate into large potential drops across the Stern layer, Eq. (10), which

help drive the deposition reaction, Eq. (12). As a result, neither the electric ﬁeld nor
the cation concentration need to be very large at the cathode to support high current
densities. These results conﬁrm our physical intuition that it is only important to
pay attention to the diﬀuse layer when the Stern layer potential drop is negligible (i.e
δ

1).
At high currents, another important eﬀect of the Stern layer capacitance is that
the total cell voltage becomes dominated by the potential drop across the Stern layer
at large δ values (i.e.
small capacitances). This behavior is clearly illustrated in
Figure 8. Notice for currents below the classical diﬀusion-limited current, the total
cell voltage does not show a strong dependence on δ. However, for ı > 1, the total
cell voltage increases with δ – the increase being driven by the strong δ dependence
of the Stern voltage.

7. Conclusion. In summary, we have studied classical problem of direct current
in an electrochemical cell, focusing on the exotic regime of high current densities. A
notable new feature of our study is the use of nonlinear Butler-Volmer and Stern
boundary conditions to model a thin ﬁlm passing a Faradaic current, as in a micro-
battery. We have derived leading-order approximations for the ﬁelds at and above
the classical, diﬀusion-limited current, paying special attention to the structure of
the cathodic boundary layer, which must be present to satisfy the reaction boundary
conditions.
In our analysis of superlimiting current, we have shown that the key
feature of the bulk space-charge layer is the depletion of anions. Our exact solution of
the leading-order problem in the space-charge region, Eq. (50), could thus also have
relevance for Faradaic conduction through very thin insulating ﬁlms.

Using the asymptotic approximations to the ﬁelds, we are able to derive a current-
voltage relation, Eq. (65), which compares well with numerical results, far beyond the
limiting current. Combined with the analogous formulae in the companion paper [9],
which hold below the limiting current, we have essentially analyzed the full range of

the current-voltage relation. These results could be useful in interpreting experimental
data, e.g. on the internal resistance of thin-ﬁlm microbatteries.

A general conclusion of this study is that boundary conditions strongly aﬀect
the solution. For example, the Stern-layer capacitance, often ignored in theoretical
analysis, plays an important role in determining the qualitative structure of the cell
near the cathode, as well as the total cell voltage. The nonlinear boundary condi-
tions for Butler-Volmer reaction kinetics also profoundly aﬀect charge distribution
and current-voltage relation, compared to the ubiquitous case of Dirichlet bound-
ary conditions. The latter rely on the asumption of surface equilibrium, which is of
questionable validity at very large currents.

We leave the reader with a word of caution. The results presented here are valid
mathematical solutions of standard model equations, but their physical relevance
should be met with some skepticism under extreme conditions, such as superlimiting
current. For example, the PNP equations are meant to describe inﬁnitely dilute
solutions in relatively small electric ﬁelds [7, 27, 28]. Even for quasi-equilibrium
double layers, their validity is not so clear when the zeta potential greatly exceeds the
thermal voltage, because co-ion concentrations may exceed the physical limit required
by discreteness (accounting also for solvation shells) and counter-ion concentations
may become small enough to violate the continuum assumption. Large electric ﬁelds
can cause the permittivity to vary, by some estimates up to a factor ten, as solvent
dipoles become aligned. Including such eﬀects, however, introduces further ad hoc
parameters into the model, which may be diﬃcult to infer from experimental data.

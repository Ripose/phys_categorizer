The effetiveness of arbon supported polyaniline as anode at-

alyst in a fuel ell (FC) with diret formi aid eletrooxidation is

experimentally demonstrated. A prototype FC with suh a platinum-

free omposite anode exhibited a maximum room-temperature speifi

power of about 5 mW/cm2

PACS: 82.47.Gh 82.65.+r 82.45.Fk

1. The main advantage of fuel ells (FC) employing liquid organi fuels as

ompared to those using hydrogen is the simpliity of storage and reharging.

Among the FC with liquid fuels, the most thoroughly studied are FC with

diret methanol eletrooxidation (DMFC) [1℄. The other potential liquid

organi fuels inlude formi aid. In FC employing diret formi aid ele-

trooxidation (DFAFC) [2℄, a somewhat lower energy apaity (as ompared

to that of DMFC) is ompensated by other advantages, inluding relatively

simple reation nature (and, aordingly, failitated problem of atalyst se-

letion) and lower extent of fuel rossover through the proton-onduting

(nafion) membrane.

As is known, diret eletrohemial oxidation of organi fuels on the FC

anode leads to the formation of CO2 (omplete oxidation). In the ase of

DFAFC, the proess is:

HCOOH → CO2 + 2H + + 2e−

The ative evolution of arbon dioxide is a reliable manifestation of this

reation. The proess on the athode onsists in the redution of moleular

oxygen O2 with the formation of waterH2O :

(1)

(2)

O2 + 2H + + 2e− → H2O

2

It should be noted that athodi reation (2) is ommon to all FC with

proton-onduting membranes, whih use oxygen as the oxidizer.

The main problems inherent in all FC with diret eletrohemial oxida-

tion of organi fuels are the following:

(a) The output power yield is limited by the rate of anodi reation and

usually varies at room temperature within 5(cid:22)20 mW/cm2

[3(cid:21)5℄.

(b) The fuel rossover through a nafion membrane to athode and its

oxidation on the FC athode surfae is equivalent to an opposite emf [4, 6℄,

that is, to a derease in output power and in the FC effiieny.

() Some organi fuels produe degradation of nafion membrane in the

ourse of FC operation.

The anode and athode of FCs are eletrodes with atalyti oatings,

whih are usually based on platinum (Pt). The limited resoure of this metal

on the Earth stimulates the interest in reating nonplatinum atalysts.

For athodi reation (2), atalysts ontaining no metalli platinum have

been developed based on maroyli omplexes (see [3, 7℄ and referenes

therein), biologial materials [8℄, and transition metal ompounds [3, 6, 7℄.

It was also reported that polyaniline (PANI) exhibited atalyti ativity in

the reation of oxygen redution in air(cid:21)metal ells [9℄. All these systems

exhibit a lower atalyti ativity than platinum, but their development and

pratial use nevertheless good have prospets.

In reent years, FC units have been developed with extensive use of on-

duting polymers (syntheti metals) suh as PANI, polypyrrole, and poly-

thiophene [10(cid:21)12℄. Some data [3, 13℄ and our previous results [14, 15℄ indiate

that polymers with eletron(cid:21)proton ondutivity (suh as PANI) an inrease

the effiay of platinum group metal atalysts [16℄.

As for anodi reation (1), no atalysts free of platinum group metals

have yet been reported, although there were ommuniations on the at-

alyti ativity of PANI in the reations of anodi oxidation of hydrogen [17℄,

methanol [18℄, and asorbi aid [19℄. As is known, PANI ombines a high

level of eletron (hole) ondutivity (1 (cid:22) 10 S/m [11, 12℄) with proton on-
dutivity (up to 10−2

S/m) [15, 20, 21℄. The mixed ondutivity type of this

polymer is of key importane in eletrohemial proesses involving simulta-

neous transport of both protons and eletrons. It should also be noted that

PANI has a variable struture; this polymer ontains benzoid and quinoid

fragments linked via nitrogen atoms ourring in various oxidation and pro-

tonation states. The ratio of the fragments of various types an hange in

a reversible manner depending at least on two parameters of the reation

medium: oxidation potential and aidity [11℄. This irumstane provides

broad possibilities for ontrolled modifiation of the properties of PANI.

2. This preprint reports the proess of eletrohemial oxidation of formi

aid in an FC with the anode made of a arbon material oated with a

nanolayer (100 nm) of PANI. PANI in an emeraldine form was obtained via

aniline oxidation with ammonium peroxydisulfate immediately on the surfae

of fibers of a porous arbon material [22℄. The resulting PANI was strongly

adsorbed on the arbon substrate. The polymer nanolayer enapsulated ar-

bon fibers in the entire volume of the porous arbon matrix, so that the total

weight fration of PANI in the resulting omposite reahed 20%.

The eletro- hemial ell shematially depited in Fig. 1.

In order

to study the anodi reation, we used a athode half(cid:21)MEA (membrane(cid:21)

eletrode assembly) [23℄ omprising a Nafion 117 membrane with the stan-

dard DMFC athode ontaining 4mg/cm2

of platinum. The athode operated

in air under natural onvetion onditions.

The anode was made of Torray TGPH-060 arbon ardboard overed with

PANI nanolayer as desribed above. The ardboard was pressed against the

nafion membrane with a thiker ardboard (free of PANI oating), whih

simultaneously served as eletrode and gasdiffusion medium. The fuel was

a 5% solution of formi aid (HCOOH) in a 0.5M aqueous H2SO4 solution.

Sine the experiments were performed with a fuel possessing ioni ondu-

3

tivity, the problem of ontat quality in the anodi region was not so impor-

tant, sine protons ould readily pass from one medium to another via the

ion-ontaining fuel.

Figure 2 shows the experimental loading harateristis measured using a

prototype FC desribe above. Plots of the FC output voltage versus urrent

density in the membrane had the typial form, beginning at about 0.7V (at a

nearly zero urrent density) and rapidly deaying at urrent densities below

5 mA/cm2
of the FC prototype was estimated at about 10 Ωcm2

. Using the subsequent less steep derease, the internal resistane

. The maximum speifi

output power reahed in our experiments at room temperature was about 5

. This value orresponds to the output power of the typial DMFCs

operating at room temperature (20C) [3, 4℄. In the region of high urrent

mW/cm2

densities (10(cid:21)40 mA/cm2

experimental runs.

), the urves were poorly reprodued in different

As was noted above, the ative gas evolution on the FC anode oper-

ating on formi aid fuel is a reliable riterion for reation (1) to atually

take plae. Indeed, when the FC was onneted to a low-ohmi load and a

relatively large urrent passed through the ell, intensive evolution of CO2

bubbles (Fig. 3) was observed. The volume of liberated gas was measured

and ompared to the amount of harge transported vie the FC iruit. In this

alulation, we assumed that the oxidation of the HCOOH moleule yields a

harge of 2 × 1.6 · 10−19C . The volume of CO2 alulated for the transferred

harge was 1.8 times the volume evolved in the experiment. The reason for

so large a disrepany is still unlear. One possible explanation is offered by

the following mehanism: a fration of urrent ould be, in priniple, related

to the additional oxidation of PANI with the formation of pernigraniline.

However, alulations showed that an additional harge provided by om-

plete oxidation of PANI present on the anode was two orders of magnitude

lower than the total harge transported in the experiment.

Thus, the eletrohemial oxidation of formi aid is the only proess

that an be responsible for the liberation of energy in the prototype FC

studied. Moreover, if the observed urrent were related to PANI oxidation,

the output urrent would unavoidably drop from one run to another, whih

was not observed in our experiments.

The experiments showed no systemati derease in the output power

during the first two days. In the family of loading urves presented in Fig. 2,

the urves orresponding to the maximum urrent and density were obtained

in the last experimental run of the series. The urrent and output power

4

exhibited a reversible derease as a result of the fuel onsumption in the

FC and were restored on the initial level upon adding a new portion of

the fuel. However, the experiments performed in the following days showed

a derease in the urrent and approximately proportional derease in the

FC open-iruit voltage (down to 0.4V), and even to a lower level in the

subsequent week. We explain this behavior by the diffusion (rossover) of

formi aid in the membrane, whih results in the appearane of fuel on

the oxidizer side and is equivalent to the opposite emf operation [4, 6℄; an

additional detrimental fator is degradation of the nafion membrane surfae

in ontat with formi aid.

It is neessary to emphasize the stability of results. The eletrohemial

oxidation of formi aid is not harateristi of the given type of arbon

material. Speifi output power on a level of 3−5mW/cm2

was also obtained

in prototype FCs where PANI was supported (instead of Torray TGPH-060)

on arbon materials of the Kinol ACC-10-20 or Busofit T-1-55 types.

Thus, the results of our experiments onviningly demonstrated the at-

alyti ativity of PANI in the anodi reation of formi aid oxidation.

3. We an only suggest some notions onerning the nature of the at-

alyti ativity of PANI. One possible mehanism is the redution of PANI

from the emeraldine to leuo-emeraldine form, whih is aompanied by the

oxidation of formi aid and is followed by leuo-emeraldine oxidation to

emeraldine and eletron transfer to the anode. We believe that the re-

dox transition of PANI from the emeraldine form to a lower oxidation state

(leuo-emeraldine) mediates in the eletron transfer and aelerates the oxi-

dation of formi aid.

Another speial question onerns the possible role of the arbon-PANI

interfae in the enhanement of the atalyti ativity. We suggest that,

sine PANI is a p-type ondutor [24℄ and arbon materials possess metalli

ondutivity, this interfae features a potential barrier of the Shottky type.

Sine PANI is a medium permeable to liquids (in this ase, to formi aid),

HCOOH moleules our in a strong eletri field near the proton-onduting

membrane and the field indues their polarization, whih an in priniple

lead to a derease in the dissoiation energy. The lose phenomenon of

the polarization and subsequent ionization of shallow impurity states in the

eletri field is well known in semiondutor physis [25℄.

4. Thus, we have experimentally demonstrated that arbon supported

PANI exhibits high atalyti ativity in the reation of anodi oxidation (1)

of formi aid in fuel ells of the DFAFC type. This ativity was observed

5

in a working prototype FC with nonplatinum omposite anode of the arbon

supported PANI type, whih ensured a stable speifi output power of about

5 mW/cm2

over a long period of time. In ombination with published data

on the nonplatinum atalysts for the athodi reation, these results open

the way to the reation of FCs entirely free of platinum atalysts, whih is

the aim of our further investigations [26℄.

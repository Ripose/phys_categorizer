Modeling the dielectric behavior of molecular materials made up of large π-conjugated molecules
is an interesting and complex task. Here we address linear polarizabilities, and the related dielectric
constant, of molecular crystals and aggregates made up of closed-shell π-conjugated molecules with
either a non-polar or largely polar ground-state, and also examine the behavior of mixed-valence
(or charge-transfer) organic salts. We recognize important collective phenomena due to supramolec-
ular interactions in materials with large molecular polarizabilities, and underline large vibrational
contributions to the polarizability in materials with largely delocalized electrons.

I.

INTRODUCTION

A static electric ﬁeld F applied to an insulating material induces a dipole, µind = αF + βF 2/2 + γF 3/6 + ..,
whose magnitude depends on the polarizability, α, and hyperpolarizabilities, β, γ..., of the system. Large (hyper-
)polarizabilities imply easy redistribution of electronic or nuclear charge by the ﬁeld. For isolated molecules in the
gas phase, the formal theory of static polarizabilities and hyperpolarizabilities is well known, and accurate results
can be obtained from quantum chemical calculations on simple molecules.1 For complex molecular structures the
calculation becomes challenging, particularly in large π
conjugated molecules, where important contributions to
−
(hyper-)polarizabilities are expected from molecular vibrations.2 For molecules in solution the polarization of the
solvent screens the applied ﬁelds and the calculation of (hyper-)polarizabilities becomes fairly involved.3

In the solid state, and particularly in crystals, the deﬁnition of the dipole moment itself is challenging, and a formal
theory for the polarization, P , the dipole moment for unit cell, was developed only in the last decade4. The problem is
that the polarization of the material apparently depends on the choice of the unit cell.5 This problem ﬁnds a natural
solution in the so-called Berry-phase formulation of P , that relates the macroscopic polarization of the crystal to the
ground state (gs) wavefunction rather than to the gs charge-density.4,6,7,8 A key concept in the modern theory of
polarization is that P is by itself ill-deﬁned and not accessible experimentally: only variations of P can in fact be
deﬁned as independent of boundary-conditions, and are experimentally accessible.8 The Berry-phase formulation of
polarizability in insulating materials constitutes an important advance in understanding the electrical properties of
crystalline materials, but does not solve the problem of the deﬁnition of a dipole moment operator in systems with
periodic boundary conditions.9,10 A complete and coherent picture for the polarizability (and hyperpolarizability) of
crystalline materials is still lacking.

The Berry-phase deﬁnition of P is particularly important in covalent insulators, i.e.

in crystals such as oxides
or silicon, where the charge density is sizeable even between atoms. In organic molecular crystals, by contrast, the
overlap between electronic wavefunctions on diﬀerent molecules is small and there is an unambiguous natural way of
partitioning the crystal into an assembly of neutral, localized unit cells (the so-called Clausius-Mossotti limit).5,8 In
the zero overlap approximation for charge-densities on diﬀerent molecules, the dipole moment operator for the crystal
is simply the sum of the dipole moments of the basic unit cells, and standard approaches to linear and non-linear
polarizabilities apply: the formal problem of calculating the crystal polarization and the relevant (hyper)polarizability
is trivially solved in this limit. The actual calculation of the electrical responses of molecular crystals is diﬃcult,
however, particularly for crystals of highly polarizable molecules.
In these materials in fact important collective
eﬀects are expected11 and, even if the dipole moment can be calculated as the sum of local dipole moments, the
polarizability and the hyperpolarizabilities are not the sum of local contributions.

In this paper we address the calculation of the linear polarizability α in crystalline materials, as related to the
experimentally accessible static dielectric constant. Sections 2 and 3 are devoted to the analysis of organic molecular
crystals with little or no intermolecular overlap. In these insulators the zero-overlap approximation for charge densities
allows to adopt standard expressions for the polarizability tensor, whose Cartesian components αi,j measure the
curvature of the gs energy E0(F ) with respect to the ﬁeld:

The sum-over-state (SOS) expression is the second order correction. It involves the excited states R at energy ER
above the gs at F = 0 and the dipole operator µ. The ﬁrst expression for α above is the ﬁnite-ﬁeld (FF) result,
that requires only the gs, albeit at ﬁnite ﬁelds. We emphasize the long-range nature of electrostatic interactions that
lead to signiﬁcant perturbations to α as due to the environment even in the absence of direct intermolecular overlap.
Section 2 reviews a recent approach to the detailed calculation of α in non-polar chromophores with an extended
and strongly polarizable π-system. This approach, based on the FF calculation of α for molecules experiencing the
electric ﬁeld generated by the surrounding molecules, relies on quantum chemical models for the isolated molecular
fragments and leads to quantitative estimates of the dielectric constant for crystals and ﬁlms that nicely compare
with experimental data.

Section 3 presents an instructive toy model for clusters of polar and polarizable chromophores, based on a two-
state picture for each chromophore. Whereas this simple model is hardly quantitative, it correctly grasps the basic
physics of supramolecular interactions in these materials. Very schematically, Fig. 1 depicts a polar chromophore
in an environment of polar molecules that can be either an ordered crystal or a solution. Electrostatic interactions
among dipoles and induced dipoles require a self-consistent treatment that accounts for large local ﬁelds due to the
dipoles and induced dipoles themselves. Huge collective eﬀects are possible in systems of polar-polarizable molecules,
and are indeed expected for certain ranges of parameters. We note that the dipoles in Fig. 1 may represent both
electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom or more complicated charge distributions. Quite generally, the zero-overlap
approximation for molecular aggregates or crystals leads to such electrostatic problems.

Models with a limited number of states are then particularly instructive for assessing the inevitable approximations
in molecular or extended systems. The Born-Oppenheimer (BO) separation of electronic and nuclear degrees of
freedom is ubiquitous for molecules and generates potential energy surfaces (PES). In Section 4 we will assess the BO
approximation for α in models whose exact eigenstates are accessible, and will present a very simple expression for
the vibrational contributions to α that applies in the limit of low vibrational frequencies.

Based on these results, in Section 5 we brieﬂy address the role of vibrational degrees of freedom in charge-transfer
(CT) salts with a mixed (donor acceptor, DA) stack motif and variable ionicity. A ﬁrst description of these materials
was given in terms of non-overlapping DA pairs,12 so that collective eﬀects in α are easily predicted. However, any
realistic model for CT salts must account for charge delocalization along the stack. Since the Clausius-Mossotti
approximation no longer applies, we resort to Berry-phase polarization and consider P at instabilities. We relate the
peak in the dielectric constant observed in some CT salts at a Peierls instability to large charge-ﬂuxes induced along
the stack by lattice vibrations.

We ask how the charge density ρ(r) in the solid diﬀers from the gas-phase density ρG(r) of molecules at the same

be viewed as polarization and rationalized by small overlaps in organic crystals. Organic molecular solids typically
have van der Waals contacts and slightly shifted electronic or vibrational excitations, as suggested by the oriented
gas model that is the starting point of molecular exciton theory. First-order corrections to energies clearly depend
only on ρG(r), which can be inferred from gas-phase experiment or theory. Electronic polarization is the ﬁrst-order
correction to ρG(r), or to the wavefunction, and is accordingly more diﬃcult to compute.

−

Small overlap at van der Waals separations suggests starting with zero intermolecular overlap and introducing ﬁnite
band widths later. In the zero-overlap approximation, charge redistribution ∆ρ(r) is clearly conﬁned to molecules and
intermolecular interactions are purely electrostatic.16 In this sense, the speciﬁc model of polar-polarizable molecules
introduced in the next Section represents any aggregate. Conceptually, we have a crystal of quantum mechanical
molecules with classical interactions that may be viewed as a non-uniform electric ﬁeld F (r). Since induced dipoles
contribute to F (r), a self-consistent solution is required and made practical by translational symmetry. For example,
consider a crystal in a uniform Fext. Since all unit cells have the same total ﬁeld, we apply constant F and resolve
F into local and external ﬁelds at the end.17 The calculation of P+ or P− , the polarization energy of an isolated
charge, is done in two steps.16 First, the extensive quantity ∆ρN (r) is found for the neutral lattice using translational
invariance. Then the intensive quantity ∆ρ±(r, R) is found relative to ∆ρN (r) in spheres of radius R about the charge
without redistributing charge on molecules whose center is outside the sphere. Convergence to P± rigorously goes

as 1/R at large R with a slope that depends on the dielectric tensor κ. Representative organic crystals show proper
100 ˚A. This corresponds to clusters of thousands of molecules and underscores the long-range
convergence by R
nature of polarization. The polarization energy of CT states also requires two steps, again starting with ∆ρN (r). The
sphere R now encloses a cation and anion at ﬁxed separation in the crystal lattice. The polarization energy converges
faster, as 1/R3, since a dipole is enclosed.

∼

The zero-overlap approximation reduces electronic polarization to ﬁnding α for molecules in a non-uniform ﬁeld
F (r). This major simpliﬁcation yields a continuum problem for the functional derivative, ∂ρ(r)/∂V (r′), of the gs
charge density at r with respect to the potential at r′. To be practical for crystals or thin ﬁlms of large molecules,
we introduce a discrete approximation for ∂ρ/∂V by restricting r and r′ at molecule a to the atomic positions ra
i and
i . As done routinely in electrostatic (Madelung) calculations,18 we represent the
evaluating V (r) and F =
gas phase ρG(r) by atomic charges ρa(0)
i . Electronic polarization then yields new atomic charges and induced
atomic dipoles that are given by the following linear equations,16

We comment on general aspects of charge redistribution without going into computational details that are found
in refs. 16 and 19. First, semiempirical theory such as INDO/S20 is particularly convenient for Πij since φa
is
i
then simply a site energy; this approximation, typical in solid-state models, is neither the ﬁnite-ﬁeld nor the SOS
method of eq. (1), but can be compared to them in exact models. Second, the best gas-phase polarizability α from
experiment or theory is retained and partitioned between charge redistribution and a remainder, the ˜αa
i above. An
intuitive partitioning of α in acenes, as done in the submolecular method15,21, leads to self-consistent equations for
induced dipoles in external ﬁelds. Similarly, the gs dipole µ of polar molecules can be partitioned between charge
redistribution and the µa(0)
above. In the spirit of molecular exciton theory, we focus on how ∆ρ(r) changes in the
actual crystal lattice for molecules whose electronic structure is given by hypothesis. Third, polarization energies are
bilinear expressions16 in self-consistent atomic charges and induced dipoles coupled to gas-phase potentials or, vice
versa, self-consistent potentials and ﬁelds coupled to gas-phase charges or dipoles. Since potentials and ﬁelds produced
by the best gas-phase charge distribution ρG(r) can be evaluated at atomic positions of the crystal lattice, ﬁrst-order
corrections to polarization energies based on discrete ρa(0)
can readily be found.22 Such corrections are important in
acenes or other systems with electron-hole symmetry and hence ρa(0)

0 in the neutral molecule.

The optical dielectric tensor, or indices of refraction, of anthracene crystals has been measured23 separately and
taken together yield the principal values κii and uncertainties in Table 1. The principal axes are the crystallographic
b axis, by symmetry, and θ is the angle between κ11 and a in the ac plane. All calculations are based on the same,
INDO/S-based Πij, but have diﬀerent molecular α inputs as indicated in the Table, including the experimental
polarizability. The triple-zeta basis with ﬁeld-induced polarization functions from ref. 24 and density functional
theory (B3LYP) with a large basis are nearly quantitative, while the oriented-gas value based on ρG(r) is clearly not.
The dielectric tensor of the crystal includes charge redistribution and induced dipoles whose interactions are treated
self-consistently via eqs (2) and (3).

Polarization energies P+ or P− are surface rather than bulk measurements.25 As sketched in Fig. 2, photoelectron
spectroscopy (UPS) involves P+ for a cation that is mainly at the surface while inverse photoelectron spectroscopy
(IPES) involves P− . To minimize charging, thin organic ﬁlms on metallic substrates are used. Recent interest
in organic electronic devices is made possible by advances in forming and characterizing crystalline thin ﬁlms that
compensate for the limited mobility of charges. Charge injection then involves polarization at the metal-organic
interface. A constant potential surface with image charges is the simplest model of the metal-organic interface. The
zero-overlap procedure for electronic polarization, eqs. (2) and (3), is readily extended to surfaces or interfaces.26 We

i ∼

4

take N molecular layers based on the crystal, place them in van der Waals contact with the metal, and introduce
image charges and dipoles for neutral molecules as well as for ions at speciﬁed locations. Instead of spheres of radius
R that enclose ions, we use pill-boxes of thickness 2N and variable radius. Convergence again requires thousands of
molecules and can be monitored with respect to N as well as pill-box radius.

Perylenetetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA) is a good hole conductor and excellent ﬁlm former, with molecules
lying almost ﬂat on the surface.27 It is a prototypical molecule for organic devices. The crystal value for P = P++P− is
1.82 eV, which is in the expected range.16 The calculated monolayer value is Pmono= 1.93 eV.26 The large polarizability
of image charges on one side oﬀsets the vacuum on the other side. Accordingly, thick ﬁlms have reduced Psurf = 1.41
eV. The 500 meV change between monolayers and thick ﬁlms agrees quantitatively with UPS, IPES, and tunneling
spectra of PTCDA monolayers and ﬁlms on gold and silver.26 The calculated P at the metal-organic interface, with
image charges on one side and crystal on the other, increases to Pinter = 2.21 eV. The separate values of P+ or P−
are relevant for matching energy levels to facilitate the injection of holes or electrons. Eﬃcient injection is a major
challenge whose pursuit is largely empirical at present, usually without any consideration of polarization.

Pentacene is another widely used molecule, mainly as thin ﬁlm transistors.28 Its herringbone structure is more
common than PTCDA stacks. Pentacene ﬁlms have the long axis almost normal to the surface, with high conductivity
parallel to the surface. The two inequivalent molecules per unit cell are calculated19 to have slightly (70 meV) diﬀerent
P = 2.01 eV in the crystal. Pmono diﬀers by only 6 meV from the crystal, while Psurf is 0.23 eV less and Pinter is 0.13
eV greater.19 The contrasting structures of pentacene and PTCDA ﬁlms lead to diﬀerent electronic polarizabilities
that can now be estimated in the well-deﬁned limit of zero overlap rather than just expected on general grounds in
anisotropic solids. Similarly, accurate polarization energies are needed for quantitative analyses of transport gaps or
of CT states seen in electroabsorption.

In the context of polarizabilities, we close this Section by noting that since the pentacene long axis is almost normal
to the metal, the images charges for a cation or anion produce ﬁelds along the direction of largest α and redistribute
charge to the ends of the molecule. The induced dipoles of adjacent molecules are parallel and close to each other.
These repulsive interactions are relieved by redistributing charge toward the molecule’s center, as actually found in
the self-consistent solution.19 The ﬁeld F (ra
i ) at a pentacene ion on a metallic surface vanishes for atoms near the
107 V/cm for atoms close to and far from the metal. Electronic polarization in organic
center and ranges from
molecular crystals produces highly non-uniform ﬁelds, as found explicitly in pentacene ﬁlms and studied below in
clusters of polar-polarizable molecules.

In so-called push-pull
chromophores an electron-donor (D) and an electron-acceptor (A) group are linked by a π-conjugated bridge. These
intrinsically polar molecules are also highly polarizable due to the presence of delocalized π-electrons. They are
also often largely hyper-polarizable, and represent the molecules of choice for second-order NLO applications.29 As
originally recognized by Oudar and Chemla,30 the low-energy physics of push-pull chromophores is well described
by a two-state picture. The gs resonates between two limiting structures:

This simple model sets the basis for current understanding of NLO responses of push-pull chromophores and, if
extended to account for the coupling to molecular vibrations and solvation eﬀects, it oﬀers a good description of the
spectroscopic properties of push-pull chromophores in solution.32,33 Here we adopt this model to investigate the role of
intermolecular interactions in clusters of polar-polarizable chromophores. We consider a cluster of Mulliken molecules
with purely electrostatic interactions. The relevant Hamiltonian is:34

The ﬁrst term in (5) describes the on-site problem, with ˆρi measuring the polarity (i.e. the weight of the zwitterionic

electrostatic intermolecular interactions with Vij measuring the interaction between zwitterionic species located on
sites i and j.

The Hamiltonian (5) is fairly general. Here we consider 1-dimensional clusters of N equivalent molecules with the
three geometries sketched in Fig. 3. We model each zwitterionic molecule as a segment of length l carrying
e charges
at the D/A ends, so that, for unscreened interactions, Vij is ﬁxed by v = e2/l, the interaction between two charges at
unit distance, and r, the interchromophore distance. In any case the speciﬁc expression for Vij does not alter the basic
physics of the model. The above Hamiltonian is easily written and diagonalized on the 2N basis obtained from the
direct product of the two basis functions,

Fig. 4 shows the evolution of the chromophore polarity with the inverse interchromophore distance, w = l/r for
the three lattices sketched in Fig. 3. All results are obtained for v = 1; z0 is ﬁxed to 1 in upper panels, to show the
behavior of a chromophore with a neutral (N) ground state in the gas phase (ρ = 0.15 at w = 0). The bottom panels
(z0 =
1) instead describe the behavior of zwitterionic (I) chromophores (ρ = 0.85 at w = 0). Interchromophore
interactions disfavor charge separation in A geometry, and ρ decreases with w in the leftmost panels in Fig. 4, whereas
just the opposite occurs for geometry B and C (Fig. 4, middle and right panels). The behavior of an A cluster of
I chromophores (Fig. 4(b)) and of B and C clusters of N molecules (Fig. 4(c) and (e), respectively) are particularly
interesting. In the ﬁrst case the isolated chromophore is zwitterionic, but, with increasing w (i.e. by decreasing the
interchromophore distance) the molecular polarity decreases down to the cyanine limit (ρ = 0.5) reaching the N regime
for an interchromophore distance of about 0.7 times the dipole length. Similarly, a neutral isolated chromophore can
be driven to the I regime for large enough interactions in either B and C geometries when the interchromophore
distance is about one half of the dipole length (B cluster) or about 1.4 times the dipole length (C cluster).
To make contact with experiment, we note that as a ﬁrst estimate, push-pull chromophores have √2t

geometry crosses the I-N interface at w
situation. Similarly, curves in panels (c) and (e) indicate that the N-I interface is crossed for interchromophore
20 ˚A for B and C cluster, respectively. Again the inversion of the polarity occurs for
distance of
reasonable intermolecular distances. As a matter of fact, it has already been predicted35 that the polarity of a
polar and polarizable molecule varies and eventually inverts due to environmental interactions. However, most of the
approaches presented in the literature on the properties of interacting push-pull chromophores disregard the molecular
polarizability and do not allow the molecular polarity to readjust in response to supramolecular interactions. On

The mf treatment of the previous Section becomes trivial when applied to the above Hamiltonian. In the two-state
model in fact a single parameter, ρi, fully deﬁnes both the molecular gs and local electric ﬁelds at the molecular
positions. For lattices of equivalent molecules, as in Fig. 3, a single-parameter self-consistent problem results from
the mf approach. In particular, within mf the lattice reduces to a collection of non-interacting molecules, each one

Within mf it is easy to recognize a qualitative diﬀerence between the I to N crossover in repulsive lattices (A) and
the N to I crossover in attractive lattices (B and C). With increasing supramolecular interactions in repulsive lattice
(A, m > 0) the ρ(z0) curve becomes less negative, whereas it becomes more negative in attractive lattices (B and
C, m < 0). For large negative m (m <
∂z0 is expected, marking the occurrence of a discontinuous
−
crossover from the N to the I regime.37 The N-I crossover is located at z0 ∼ −
m/2, and for large z0 ( > 1) S-shaped
ρ(w) curves are calculated within mf. The appearance of a discontinuous crossover in mf treatments of C-lattices
was discussed many years ago, and oﬀered a ﬁrst description of the neutral-ionic phase transition observed in CT
crystals with a mixed stack motif.12 The behavior of the system in the proximity of a discontinuous interface is very
interesting, but is beyond the scope of the present work.34

2) a divergent ∂ρ

The static susceptibilities of systems described by the Hamiltonian in Eq. (5) are easily obtained from the successive
derivatives of the ground-state dipole moment on a static applied ﬁeld. Since molecular dipole moments, in the
proposed toy model, rigorously lie along the molecular axis (say z), a single component of the polarizability tensor
(αzz) is relevant. The magnitude of this component is shown in Fig. 5 for parameters corresponding to panels b, c
and e in Fig. 4. Continuous lines show exact results and demonstrate that supramolecular interactions non-trivially
aﬀect the molecular response.

To clarify the subtle physics governing the responses of molecular clusters, we discuss approximate approaches to the
problem. In the simplest and most widely adopted approach the response of a collection of chromophores is calculated
as the sum of the responses of a collection of non-interacting molecules with the same geometrical arrangement.36 This

6

oriented gas approach is however limited to very weak interactions and fails otherwise, since it completely disregards
the dependence of ρ on supramolecular interactions. A slightly better approach relies again on the oriented gas
approximation, but assigns each chromophore the same ρ as obtained within the mf approximation. The mf-oriented
gas estimates of static susceptibilities are reported in Fig. 5 as dotted lines. The strikingly large deviations from
exact results are quite unexpected: the gs polarity is fairly accurately calculated within mf, for these parameters. The
failure of the mf-oriented-gas approximation appears since the response to an applied ﬁeld of a molecule in the cluster
diﬀers from the response of an isolated molecule to the same ﬁeld. Much better results can be obtained within mf
provided the gs dipole moment of each molecule in the cluster is allowed to readjust to the applied ﬁeld. A proper
FF-mf calculation of the polarizability as the ﬁrst derivative of the cluster dipole moment on the applied ﬁeld just
represents the (trivial) implementation to the Hamiltonian 5 of the self-consistent treatment described the Section 2.
As shown by dashed lines in Fig. 5, this approach nicely compares with exact results, apart from deviations observed
in a narrow region around the N-I crossover.

The static linear polarizability is a gs property that can be accurately calculated within mf, provided collective
behavior is properly accounted for. Non-linear responses can be obtained within the same approach from the suc-
cessive derivatives of the gs dipole moment, and collective eﬀects are found to rapidly increase with the order of
non-linearity.37 The deviations between dotted and dashed lines in Fig. 5 demonstrate the importance of collective
behavior, here due to the non-linear response of polarizable chromophores to the perturbation induced by the sur-
rounding. Material properties are signiﬁcantly aﬀected by the supramolecular arrangement:
linear and non-linear
optical properties can be strongly depressed or ampliﬁed by tuning intermolecular distances and/or by changing the
relative orientation of chromophores, with eﬀects that are more pronounced at intermediate polarities. The design
of molecular materials for advanced applications is then a challenging task: the material properties in fact must
be optimized at the supramolecular level. The presented model just represents a ﬁrst step towards supramolecular
structure-properties relationships.

IV. VIBRATIONAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO α: A TOY-MODEL APPROACH

Both molecular vibrations and lattice phonons are strongly coupled to delocalized electrons and can signiﬁcantly
contribute to susceptibilities. Accounting for vibrational degrees of freedom even within a simple model for molecular
materials like that presented in the previous Section is non-trivial. Exact non-adiabatic solution of the relevant
problem is already computationally demanding for clusters of just two molecules. In the following we therefore shortly

The ﬁrst two terms in the above equation describe the electronic Hamiltonian (cf previous Section). In the third

The second derivative of the exact non-adiabatic gs energy vs the applied ﬁeld, gives the exact estimate of the

corresponds to the bare electronic susceptibility, α0, i.e. to the response of the two-state model with no e-ph coupling.
Hence diﬀerences between the continuous lines and the dot-dashed line measure the vibrational contribution to the
static response.40

eﬀective electronic Hamiltonian,
the total Hamiltonian. Its diagonalization yields analytical expressions for the ground and excited state potential
energy surfaces (PES).40 Even if the Hamiltonian in Eq. 6 assigns the two basis states two harmonic PES with equal
curvature, the PES for the ground and excited state obtained from the diagonalization of the electronic Hamiltonian
have diﬀerent curvatures and are largely anharmonic.39 The anharmonicity of the potential prevents the analytical
solution of the vibrational problem on either the ground or excited state; however, numerically exact vibrational
states can be calculated in both manifolds.40 In particular, the eigenstates of the harmonic oscillator with frequency
ω, centered at the relevant equilibrium position, are a good basis for the vibrational problem on either PES. The
corresponding vibrational Hamiltonian is the sum of a KE term, whose matrix elements are trivial in the adopted
basis, plus a PE term, whose matrix elements are calculated via numerical integration. Of course the vibrational
matrix is diagonalized on a basis truncated to a large enough number of phonon states as to get convergence.

Once BO eigenstates are obtained, the (transition) dipole moments entering the SOS expression can be calculated
via numerical integration. The static polarizability calculated within BO approximation is indistinguishable (in the
scale of Fig. 6) from the exact one, as long as ω
0.2. Fig. 7 compares non-adiabatic (continuous line) and BO

When applied within a FF approach to susceptibilities, the BO approximation immediately leads to a partitioning
of the susceptibility into PE and KE contributions.40 Within BO, the lowest eigenstate of the electronic Hamiltonian
deﬁnes the PE for the motion of nuclei (in the gs manifold, of course). The total gs energy is obtained by adding the
nuclear KE to the PE. Then, as long as BO applies, susceptibilities, i.e. the successive derivatives of the gs energy with
respect to an applied electric ﬁeld, can be calculated as sums of PE and KE F -derivatives. The nuclear KE vanishes
in the ω = 0 limit, and the (ω-independent) PE polarizability, reported as the dashed line in Fig. 6, represents the
zero-frequency limit of the exact polarizability. The electronic polarization of the Holstein DA molecule is analytical2
and is reported as the dot-dashed line in Fig. 6. We can now understand the evolution of the vibrational contribution
to the polarizability with the vibrational frequency:
in the low-ω limit, KE contributions vanish, and the exact
curve tends to the limiting PE result. Vibrational contributions are very large in this limit. With increasing ω, the
vibrational contributions to the response decrease: in the antiadiabatic limit (ω
) the vibrational contributions
to the static polarizability vanishes, and the exact curve trivially reproduces the bare electronic response.

The calculation of PE-susceptibilities for the toy-model in Eq. (6) is trivial. More generally it is easily implemented
in quantum chemistry calculations and in solid-state models as well, since it only requires the gs energy calculated at
the relaxed geometry for diﬀerent values of an externally applied ﬁeld. The calculation of KE contribution is more
diﬃcult, since the F -dependence of the lowest vibrational state in the anharmonic gs PES is needed. The nuclear
KE contributes to susceptibilities in two diﬀerent ways.40 First of all, due to anharmonicity, the molecular geometry
in the vibronic gs is diﬀerent from the equilibrium geometry (corresponding to the minimum of the gs PES). This
correction is however very small. The second contribution stems from the F -dependence of the nuclear KE itself: it
is this contribution that indeed accounts for the deviations of the exact curves from the (dashed) PE curve (at least
0.2, where non-adiabatic corrections are negligible). KE contributions are of course very small
in the BO regime, ω
for low ω, but they increase with increasing ω, leading to a suppression of the vibrational ampliﬁcation of the static
√2t) phonons cannot contribute to
polarizability. This is by no means accidental: in the antiadiabatic limit (ω
the static polarizability and, with increasing ω, KE contributions progressively increase to counterbalance the PE
contribution.

≤

KE contributions to the linear polarizability exactly vanish in the harmonic approximation.40 In fact, the equi-
librium position in any harmonic vibrational state coincides with the bottom of the PES; moreover the nuclear KE
is proportional to the harmonic frequency, i.e. to the curvature of the PES. For a parabolic PES, this quantity is
obviously independent of Q, and hence of F . Then, in the low ω limit, where KE contributions to susceptibilities are
negligible, the exact α (continuous line in Fig. 6) coincides with the corresponding best-harmonic estimate, i.e. with
the estimate obtained by modeling the gs PES as the parabola with the exact curvature at the equilibrium. This is
not true for hyper-polarizabilities that, in the same ω
0 limit, are strongly ampliﬁed by the anharmonicity of the
gs PES.40 Within the best harmonic approximation,39 α is conveniently partitioned into an electronic and vibrational
contribution:

where µIR is the infrared transition dipole moment and Ω is the frequency of the best harmonic frequency, i.e. the
curvature of the gs PES at equilibrium. The vibrational contribution to the linear polarizability is then proportional to
the infrared intensity of the coupled mode, at least in the low-frequency regime, where PE contributions dominate the
response. We underline that this result only relies on the BO approximation and on the neglect of KE contributions to

8

the polarizability. It therefore applies in the low-ω limit quite irrespective of the detailed model for the electron-phonon
coupling, and also for largely anharmonic PES.

V. DIELECTRIC CONSTANT OF CT SALTS

Charge-transfer (CT) crystals have mixed face-to-face stacks of planar π-electron donors and acceptors as sketched
in Fig. 8. Intermolecular overlap is negligible between stacks, but not within stacks where π
π overlap is indicated
by less than van der Waals separation between D and A. The gs consequently has fractional charges ρ at D and -ρ
at A sites.41 Just as an example, in the prototypical material, TTF-CA, at ambient conditions about 0.2 electrons
are transferred on average from the donor (tetrathiafulvalene, TTF) to the acceptor (chloranil, CA).42 As seen in
Fig. 8, a regular stack of centrosymmetric molecules is not polar because there is an inversion center at each site, as
in fact occurs in the actual structures. The inversion center is lost on dimerization and the gs becomes ferroelectric
if dimerization is in the same sense everywhere. Much as it occurs in attractive lattices in Section 3, Madelung
interactions favor charge separation, and a large variation of ρ can be induced by tuning intermolecular distances. At
0.7.42 Other systems with N-I
∼
transitions are known and transitions can be induced by temperature, pressure or by absorption of light. They are
a complex and interesting phenomenon:43 both continuous and discontinuous transitions are known and, in all cases,
stack dimerization accompanies the charge crossover proving the important role of phonons and of e-ph coupling in
these systems.

∼

A sharp peak in the dielectric constant has been observed at the N-I transition of several CT crystals,44. It can be
understood on general grounds as due to large charge ﬂuxes induced by an applied ﬁeld near the charge crossover, but
microscopic modeling of dielectric peaks is still in progress.45 Charges are delocalized along the stack and the zero-
overlap approximation does not apply: we need a model for polarization in extended and highly correlated systems.
Moreover the lattice (Peierls) phonon that induces dimerization is strongly coupled to electronic degrees of freedom
in a manner reminiscent of solitons in polyacetylene.46 The Peierls mode in fact induces large charge displacements
around the N-I crossover, and vibrational contributions to the polarizability cannot be disregarded.

The electronic structure of mixed stack CT salts can be described in terms of a Hubbard model with only on-
site electron-electron repulsion (U ) explicitly accounted for, and modiﬁed to account for the alternation of on-site
energies, ∆.47 This model accounts only implicitly for Madelung interactions and hence describes only continuous N-I
transitions. We also account for the coupling to the Peierls phonon, described by δ, as follows:49

measures the bare elastic energy associated with the dimerization mode, with 1/ǫd measuring the lattice stiﬀness.
The rigid lattice has ǫd = 0.

For ∆ >> U the Hamiltonian (9) describes an almost N lattice (ρ

0) of donors and acceptors, whereas for
1).47 The two phases are qualitatively diﬀerent,
U >> ∆ an almost I lattice of spin 1/2 radical ions is obtained (ρ
with the I lattice being unconditionally unstable to dimerization (spin-Peierls transitions,48). The N-I crossover can
consequently be identiﬁed precisely even for continuous ρ in the rigid regular stack.47 Conditional instability in the
N regime implies that soft lattices dimerize on that side before reaching the N-I crossover.49 The Peierls phonon
induces large charge ﬂuxes along the chain with eﬀects that increase the nearer the dimerization transition is to the
N-I crossover of the rigid lattice.

By exploiting the recent deﬁnition of polarization in extended systems4, we were able to demonstrate huge peaks in
the IR intensity of the Peierls mode at the structural instability.49 But, as shown in the previous Section for Holstein
modes, the IR intensity of vibrational modes is quite naturally related to the system’s polarizability. We draw two
inferences: ﬁrst, peaks in the static dielectric constant near the neutral-ionic phase transition have a large contribution
from vibrational degrees of freedom; second such peaks in soft lattices are associated with the Peierls transition and
occur at ρ < 1/2. We anticipate that the Hamiltonian (9) or a closely related model will describe dielectric peaks.

Since lattice phonons have low frequencies (< 100 cm−1 << t

0.2 eV), the BO approximation applies and the KE
contribution to α can be safely neglected. The calculation of the vibrational contribution to α in Eq. (7) is simple,
given the IR intensity of the relevant model. But the electronic contribution to α is diﬃcult for correlated electrons
and will be presented separately.45

∼

As a ﬁrst estimate of the relative importance of the electronic and vibrational contributions, we consider the U = 0
limit of uncorrelated electrons in (9), whose electronic α has long been known.50 U = 0 results are reported in Fig.

9

9 for ǫd = 0.28, which is a fairly stiﬀ lattice that approximates TTF-CA. The static dielectric constant is related to
polarizability by the standard expression: κ = 1 + (αel + αvib)/κ0, where κ0 is the permittivity of vacuum and α is the
polarizability per unit cell. We took TTF-CA lattice parameters as typical for CT crystals. Moreover, for the sake
of simplicity, we neglected the softening of the Peierls mode at the transition, by simply substituting the Ω entering
the expression for the vibrational polarizability in Eq. (7) with the reference frequency (1/ǫd). Thus the estimated
vibrational contribution to κ is a lower limit.

The magnitude of electronic and vibrational contributions to κ is similar for noninteracting electrons. Yet the
peak at the Peierls instability in Fig. 9 clearly has a vibrational origin. The physical basis of this behavior lies in
the large charge ﬂuctuations generated by Peierls phonons in the vicinity of a charge instability, and underlines once
more the importance of properly accounting for e-ph coupling in systems with delocalized electrons. All material
properties, including electronic responses are in fact non-trivially aﬀected by coupling to nuclear motions. The
electronic contribution, by contrast, is dominated in U = 0 systems by the gap between the valence and conduction
band of (9). This gap is almost constant51 at equilibrium in the dimerized lattice, with increasing δ oﬀsetting
decreasing ∆ in Fig. 9 to give an almost constant κel.

Electronic correlations decrease αel and stabilize the I phase of radical ions. CT salts are correlated systems with
large U in (9). Although their dielectric constants are not expected to resemble U = 0 results, the Peierls instability
on the N side nevertheless ensures a strong vibrational peak where αel is monotonic. And increasing dimerization
still produces a gap in the electronic excitations ER > 0 in (1) that reduces αel at the N-I interface. Some key U = 0
features are expected to be retained in CT salts.

VI. CONCLUSIONS

Modeling the dielectric behavior of molecular materials made up of strongly polarizable molecules is challenging in
several respects. Even in traditional molecular crystals where the overlap of charge densities on diﬀerent molecules
can be safely neglected, the self-consistent interplay between local electric ﬁeld and molecular polarizabilities (and
hyperpolarizabilities) is responsible for the appearance of large collective eﬀects: the response of the material is
quantitatively, and possibly even qualitatively diﬀerent from the behavior of a collection of non-interacting molecules.
In Section 2 a recent approach to the calculation of the dielectric constant of molecular crystals and ﬁlms made up of
large π-conjugated and non-polar molecules is summarized. The approach is based on the mf approximation, so that
the problem for N interacting molecules reduces to the self-consistent problem of a single molecule experiencing the
local electric ﬁeld generated by the surrounding molecules. The new approach to electronic polarization also yield the
polarization energies of cations, anions, and CT states, and it is applicable to crystalline thin ﬁlms.

Even larger eﬀects are expected in materials made up of polar and polarizable molecules, such as push-pull chro-
mophores. A simple toy-model for these materials is based on a two-state description of each molecular unit. Few-state
models, while less accurate than quantum-chemical descriptions, yield a more transparent description of the basic
physics of the system, and, being amenable to exact solution, oﬀer valuable information on the validity of approxima-
tions necessarily introduced when handling more complex Hamiltonians. Results in Section 3 conﬁrm the reliability of
mf approximation as introduced in Section 2 for linear (and non-linear) electric susceptibilities of molecular materials
with non-overlapping charge distributions. Exact results for the toy-model also conﬁrm the importance of collec-
tive eﬀects in aggregates of polar-polarizable chromophores, in which supramolecular interactions can tune molecular
polarity over a wide range.

Few state models are also useful to address vibrational contributions to polarizabilities, and particularly to assess
the reliability of standard approximation schemes including the BO separation of nuclear and electronic degrees of
freedom and the harmonic approximation. A reduced on-site basis, and hence models with few local states, are
also a useful starting point to face the challenging problem of polarizability in covalent insulators, such as CT salts.
Electronic (charge) instabilities and lattice instabilities coexist in these materials and compete and/or cooperate in
complex and interesting ways. The peak in the dielectric constant of several CT salts is due to the Peierls mode and
provides another example of intimate coupling between electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom.

FIG. 6: Static polarizability as a function of the ground state ionicity ρgs, for ǫsp = 1 and diﬀerent ω values (√2t units). Dashed
line: potential energy contribution, corresponding to ω = 0 limit (see text); dot-dashed line: bare electronic polarizability,
limit (see text); continuous lines report the exact polarizability calculated for ω = 0.05, 0.2, 1.0,
corresponding to the ω
smoothly evolving from the ω = 0 to the ω
limits; dotted line reports the polarizability calculated in the best harmonic
approximation (see text). Dotted and dashed lines are exactly superimposed. For the calculation dipole moments have been
expressed in µ0 units.

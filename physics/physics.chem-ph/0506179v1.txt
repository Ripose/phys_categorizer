Abstract

We study the control by electromagnetic ﬁelds of molecular alignment and orientation, in a

linear, rigid rotor model. With the help of a monotonically convergent algorithm, we ﬁnd that

the optimal ﬁeld is in the microwave part of the spectrum and acts by resonantly exciting the

rotation of the molecule progressively from the ground state, i.e., by rotational ladder climbing.

This mechanism is present not only when maximizing orientation or alignment, but also when

using prescribed target states that simultaneously optimize the eﬃciency of orientation/alignment

and its duration.

INTRODUCTION

External ﬁelds can be used to manipulate molecules, for instance by controlling their

external angular degrees of freedom, to achieve, e.g., alignment (molecular axis parallel to

a laboratory-ﬁxed axis, such as the ﬁeld polarization vector) or orientation (molecular axis

is set to have the same direction as the laboratory-ﬁxed axis). These two goals have a wide

range of applications in ﬁelds such as chemical reactivity,1 surface processing,2,3 nanoscale

design,4,5 attosecond pulse production,6,7 and quantum information processing.8 For a recent

review of the subject and of the methods used to achieve alignment and orientation, see

Ref. 9.

The purpose of the present study is to ﬁnd the electromagnetic ﬁelds that produce the

best possible orientation or alignment. We start by presenting in Sec. II the rigid rotor

model used to describe the rotation of a linear molecule, along with the cost functionals that

describes the required control objectives, in terms of both observables measuring orientation

or alignment and target states that embody the eﬃciency of orientation/alignment along

with its persistence.

The optimization procedure itself is based on monotonically convergent algorithms10,11,12

that are guaranteed to improve at each step the cost functional chosen. The discretized

version of these algorithms is presented in Sec. II C.

As we will see in Sec. III, the ﬁelds leading to optimal orientation and alignment are in the

microwave part of the spectrum and lead to rotational ladder climbing, i.e., the molecule is

resonantly excited successively from one rotational level to the next. The possibility of con-

trolling rotational excitation by ladder climbing using microwave ﬁelds was ﬁrst proposed by

Judson et al.13,14 A process similar but resting on Raman excitation of ro-vibrational states

with chirped pulses has been used to create an optical centrifuge for molecules.15,16,17,18,19

II. MODEL

A. Time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation

The dynamics of the molecule interacting with the electromagnetic ﬁeld is obtained by

solving the time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation (TDSE). We restrict ourselves to the case

of a linear molecule in a rigid rotor approximation, yielding the Hamiltonian (in atomic

2

units, ¯h = 1)

ˆH = B ˆJ 2 − µ0E(t) cos θ −

,

angle positioning the molecular axis with respect to the polarization vector of the linearly

polarized electric ﬁeld of amplitude E(t), µ0 is the permanent dipole moment, and αk and

α⊥ are the dipole polarizability components parallel and perpendicular to the molecular

axis, respectively. Because of the cylindrical symmetry about the ﬁeld polarization axis,

the motion associated with the azimuthal angle can be separated and M, the projection

of the total angular momentum J on the axis, is a good quantum number (∆M = 0).

The TDSE (1) is solved numerically starting from the ground rotational (isotropic) state

J = M = 0, using a basis set expansion of the wave function ψ in terms of the spherical

harmonics YJ,M ,

ψ(θ, t) =

cJ (t)YJ,0(θ),

(2)

the cJ being complex coeﬃcients and the coupling terms due to µ0 and α being then

analytical.20 For computational purposes, only the ﬁrst 10 terms in the sum in Eq. (2)

are kept, and we have checked that the results are not aﬀected by using a bigger basis.

Because of the presence of both the dipole moment µ and the polarizability anisotropy

∆α ≡ αk − α⊥, the results are not molecule-independent. However, the role of the polariz-

ability is negligible for the ﬁelds obtained, making them applicable to any linear molecule

with a proper scaling of the amplitude and frequency of the electric ﬁeld. The results will

thus be presented with time expressed in units of the rotational period Trot = h/2B, the

electrical ﬁeld as µ0E/B, and energy as E/B. The parameters actually used in the calcu-
lations are those for the HCN molecule: B = 6.6376 × 10−6, µ = 1.1413, αk = 20.055, and

α⊥ = 8.638 (all in atomic units).

B. Cost functional

As we are seeking to optimize molecular orientation or alignment, our cost functionals are

based on their respective measure, the expectation values hcos θi and hcos2 θi. A molecule

will be oriented when |hcos θi| ∼ 1, with the sign indicating in which direction it is pointing;

an angular distribution symmetric with respect to θ = π/2 will yield a value of zero. The

∞

XJ=0

3

expectation value of cos2 θ is 1 when the molecule is aligned, starting from 1/3 for the

isotropic case.

The ﬁrst case we consider is a cost functional of the form

J1(E) = hψ(T )| ˆO |ψ(T )i −

λ(t)E 2(t) dt,

(3)

T

0
Z

with ˆO an operator chosen to be cos θ + ˆI for orientation and cos2 θ + ˆI for alignment, the
identity operator ˆI being used for convenience (e.g., it ensures that ˆO is positive) without

modifying the extrema of J1, and T the time at which the interaction with the ﬁeld ends.

The last term in Eq. (3) is a penalization on the amplitude of the ﬁeld, with

λ(t) = 105

t − T /2

6

 

T /2 !

+ 104.

(4)

In addition to limiting the total ﬂuence, such a form ensures a smoother, and thus more

realistic, turn-on and turn-oﬀ of the ﬁeld.

The downside of such a cost functional is that it takes into account only the eﬃciency of

the orientation/alignment, not its persistence. Once the ﬁeld is turned oﬀ, the free rotation

of the molecule will lead to the disappearance of the orientation/alignment as the diﬀerent J

components in the wave function dephase, followed by revivals at intervals of one rotational

period.21 The best orientation/alignment is obtained by conﬁning the molecule to a narrow

angular distribution ∆θ, which corresponds to exciting a broad rotational band ∆J by

referring to an uncertainty principle ∆J · ∆θ ∼ ¯h.9 The problem is then that, conversely,

a broad rotational spectrum exhibits narrow features in the time domain, i.e., the greater

the orientation/alignment, the shorter its duration. A compromise has thus to be made,

as can be achieved by considering the best orientation/alignment possible for a restricted

maximum rotational excitation. The procedure on how states with such characteristics

can be obtained is given in detail in Refs. 22,23, where it can also be seen that Jmax = 4

oﬀers a good compromise, leading to an orientation of hcos θi ≈ 0.906 or an alignment of

hcos2 θi ≈ 0.837, both lasting of the order of 1/10th of the rotational period. The cost

functional is now

J2(E) = 2ℜ hψtarget |ψ(T )i −

λ(t)E 2(t) dt,

(5)

where ψtarget denotes the target state corresponding to orientation or alignment, as given in

Tab. I, and ℜ the real part. Note that because of the norm conservation properties of the

T

Z

Schr¨odinger equation, the cost functional (5) has the same minima and critical points as

J (E) = − kψtarget − ψ(T )k2 −

λ(t)E 2(t) dt,

(6)

T

0
Z

which measures the distance between ψtarget and ψ(T ).

In all cases, the time at which the ﬁeld is turned oﬀ and the cost functional measured is

chosen as T = 9.5 × 106 a.u. ≈ 20Trot for the results presented here. Shorter durations lead

to results either similar or less signiﬁcant.

C. Monotonically convergent algorithm

The algorithm used to ﬁnd the optimal ﬁeld is based on a general class of monotonically

convergent algorithms recently proposed.12 We present here the algorithm associated to

J1 and refer the reader to Refs. 24,25 for a detailed discussion the algorithm in a time-

discretized framework. At the maximum of the cost functional J1, the Euler-Lagrange

critical point equations are satisﬁed; a standard way to write these equations is to use a

Lagrange multiplier χ(θ, t) called adjoint state. The following critical point equations are

thus obtained:

i∂tψ = ˆHψ,
i∂tχ = ˆHχ,
λ(t)E(t) = −ℑ hχ| µ0 cos θ + 2E(t) (∆α cos2 θ + α⊥) |ψi ,

ψ(0) = ψ0,
χ(T ) = ˆO(((ψ(T )))),

(7)

where ℑ is the imaginary part of a complex number and ψ0 the initial state of the controlled

system.

deﬁned by Eq. (7), one can write

Given two ﬁelds E and E ′ and the corresponding states ψ, ψ′ and adjoint states χ, χ′

∆J1 = J1(E ′) − J1(E)

= hψ′(T ) − ψ(T )| ˆO |ψ′(T ) − ψ(T )i

"

The ﬁrst term of this sum is positive since both choices ˆO = cos + ˆI or ˆO = cos2 + ˆI are

positive. Given E, the integrand provides thus an implicit criterion in terms of E ′, the

5

satisfaction of which guarantees the positivity of ∆J1. An explicit choice of E ′ can be
exhibited: the integrand of Eq. (8) is a second-order polynomial with respect to E ′ and
for a large enough value of λ(t) the coeﬃcient ℑ hψ′(t)| ∆α cos2 θ+α⊥

|χ(t)i − λ(t) of E ′2(t) is

2

negative. It has thus a unique maximum, given by the cancellation of the derivative. The

value obtained by this method is

E ′(t) = −

The algorithm derived from the previous computations is then given by the following pro-

cedure: given at step k a ﬁeld E k and its associated state ψk and adjoint state χk, compute

simultaneously E k+1, ψk+1 by

E k+1 = −

III. RESULTS

A. Optimizing orientation

The electric ﬁeld obtained using the cost functional J1 [Eq. (3)] with the observable
ˆO = cos θ + ˆI, i.e., for the optimization of the orientation, is given in Fig. 1(a). To better

analyze the result, we have performed a short-time Fourier transform (STFT),26

F (ν, t) =

E(τ )w(τ − t)e−i2πντ dτ,

(13)

where w is a Tukey-Hanning window with a temporal width of 1.9 × 106 a.u. The frequency

distribution F can be seen in Fig. 1(b), where the abscissa is the dimensionless value 2νTrot,

+∞

−∞

corresponding to the dimensionless energy E/B. The energy spacing between rotational

states J and J + 1 being 2BJ, we see clearly from Fig. 1(b) that the ﬁeld is initially

resonant with the J = 0 → 1 transition, and subsequently comes in resonance with higher

and higher pairs of rotational levels J = 1 → 2, J = 2 → 3, . . . Looking at the population

of the rotational states, in Fig. 2, we indeed ﬁnd that, starting from the ground state

J = 0, the molecule is pumped to the ﬁrst excited state, then to the second, etc. At the

end of interaction with the ﬁeld, the population distribution is such that an orientation of

hcos θi (T ) = 0.909 is attained (Fig. 3). In other words, the molecule is oriented by a process

of rotational ladder climbing.

If we instead take the cost functional J2 [Eq. (5)] with ψtarget the target state for orienta-

tion given in Tab. I, we obtain a result very similar to the previous one, as shown in Fig. 4.

The main diﬀerence is the absence of the frequency component at 2νTrot = 10, which is

easily understood from the fact that it corresponds to the J = 4 → 5 transition, while the

target is restricted to Jmax = 4. The resulting dynamics of hcos θi are nearly indistinguish-

able, as is seen in Fig. 5. The similarity of both results can also be explained by looking
at the projection on the target P ≡ |hψtarget |ψ(T )i|2. For the wave function obtained for

the optimization of the observable, we already have P = 0.9933, the optimization of the

projection on the target allowing to reach P = 0.9969. This eﬃciency is better than that

obtained when kicking the molecule with short pulses.22,27

B. Optimizing alignment

The result for the maximization of the operator ˆO = cos2 θ + ˆI to achieve alignment is

given in Fig. 6. The ﬁeld obtained is almost the same as the one obtained for orientation,

except that the rotational excitation happens at a quicker pace, as displayed in Fig. 7, where

it seen that J = 5 is now signiﬁcantly populated. The alignment obtained is hcos2 θi = 0.866.

Changing now the the target state for alignment (Tab. I), we see in Fig. 8 that the ﬁeld

obtained is signiﬁcantly diﬀerent. The frequency component corresponding to an energy of

E = 4B is present for a longer time and components at E = 6B and, to a lesser extent,

E = 2B, reappear near the turn-oﬀ of the ﬁeld. The time dependence of the population of

the rotational states in Fig. 9 gives the explanation of this phenomenon: the populations

of J = 1 and 3 are pumped down by these later components, since only even J levels are

7

populated in the optimally aligned target state. The original excitation to the odd levels was

necessary as the rotational states are only signiﬁcantly coupled via the permanent dipole

moment, implying the selection rule ∆J = ±1, the role of the polarizability being here

negligible. This excitation-deexcitation scheme leads to a projection on the target state of

P = 0.9950, compared with P = 0.5487 when only optimizing for alignment.

It is interesting to note that the maximum alignment obtained is the same as in the

ﬁrst case, with hcos2 θi (T ) = 0.867 (Fig. 10), even though the two wave functions obtained

involve very diﬀerent mixtures of spherical harmonics. One striking contrast between the two

is actually not visible when looking only at hcos2 θi: in the second case, the state obtained

is strictly aligned, in the sense that the angular distribution is symmetric with respect to

θ = π/2. In the ﬁrst case, the maximum in alignment corresponds also to a maximum in

orientation, with hcos θi (T ) = 0.891, whereas in the second case hcos θi (T ) = −0.027.

IV. CONCLUSION

Using a monotonically convergent algorithm, we have searched for the optimal electric

ﬁeld maximizing either the alignment or the orientation of a linear molecule, taken in a rigid

rotor approximation. We have carried out the optimization both in terms of maximization of

observables corresponding to orientation/alignment and using target states oﬀering a good

compromise between the eﬃciency of orientation/alignment and its duration.

We have found that the optimal ﬁelds allow to reach orientation/alignment by rotational

ladder climbing, i.e., by successive resonant excitation of neighboring rotational levels. This

process allows to reach an orientation of hcos θi = 0.909 or an alignment of hcos2 θi = 0.867.

Target states can also be reached to within better than 0.5%.

By starting all simulations from the ground rotational state, we have in fact made the

approximation of a zero initial rotational temperature. From previous work on laser-induced

alignment and orientation,28,29,30,31,32 it is known that considering a higher, experimentally

more realistic initial rotational temperature will lead to an important decrease in the amount

of orientation/alignment obtained. However, additional studies28,29 have also shown that the

same basic mechanisms for orientation are at work for T > 0 K, and thus that the results

obtained here should be transferable to higher temperatures in a qualitative way. At the

same time, we note that there is an intrinsic limit on the amount of orientation/alignment

8

that can be achieved when considering a unitary evolution of mixed states,33 i.e., in the

absence of any coupling to an environment.

As a rigid rotor model was used, this study did not take into account any vibrational

excitation, which could hinder or enhance the orientation/alignment obtained. By including

vibrations into the model, it is possible to use diﬀerent control paths not involving direct

rotational excitation, enabling the choice of infra-red lasers as control ﬁelds.34,35,36 Vibration-

rotation coupling can also lead to cross-revivals of vibrational wave packets.37,38 Future work

will thus take into account the vibration of the molecule.

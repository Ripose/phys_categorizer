the 2D Franck-Condon Problem

Abstract

We use recent results regarding the geometry of the U(3) bosonic algebraic model to
motivate a hybrid algebraic-Schr¨odinger approach to the 2D Franck-Condon problem anal-
ogous to 1D approaches. This approach allows one to analyze bent to linear Franck-Condon
transitions of triatomic molecules as well as clariﬁes the angular momentum dependance of
the Franck-Condon intensities.

1 Introduction

The study of transition amplitudes for molecules with initial and ﬁnal states given by diﬀer-
ent electronic conﬁgurations has held great interest. In the Franck-Condon limit one models
the two conﬁgurations by similar eﬀective potentials with diﬀerent geometric parameters.
The transition intensities are then given by the wavefunction overlap of the two potentials
(sudden approximation) [1].

Recently, the Franck-Condon (FC) problem of polyatomic molecules has been made
tractable by the introduction of a hybrid algebraic-Schr¨odinger approach [2–4].
In this
approach a spectrum generating algebra of U1(2)× · · ·× Uk(2) (where there are k bonds) is
used to obtain wavefunctions [5]

|ψi = Xi1,...,ik

ci1,...,ik|[N1], i1i ⊗ · · · ⊗ |[Nk], iki,

(1.1)

by ﬁtting spectra of a molecule in a particular conﬁguration. In general for the two diﬀerent
conﬁgurations the ith bond contribution could change from the representation [Ni] to [N′i].
The Franck-Condon factors for the polyatomic case are realized in terms of the single bond
factors by calculating the matrix element hψ′| ˆU|ψi [2,3], where

The parameters α
α′ and ∆ are typically ﬁt from transition spectra. Due to the U(2) ⊃ O(2)
chain’s correspondence with a Morse oscillator [6] one often uses Morse eigenfunctions with
1
anharmonicity parameter
N +1 for Schr¨odinger wavefunctions. It is worth noting that the
heuristic approximation in [2] showed that this can be equivalently thought of as simple
harmonic oscillator (SHO) overlaps where the scale parameters acquire a linear n dependent
correction with coeﬃcient O(1/N). That is, one would use the equation for the overlap of
SHO wavefunctions, which has no N dependence, and substitute a scale α = α0(1−ξ(n+ 1
2)).
α0 was taken as the scale of the SHO best approximating the Morse and ξ is O(1/N). In
this way one introduces geometric parameters not contained in the algebra.

Although this approach has been successful it necessitates that the initial and ﬁnal
conﬁgurations not be too dissimilar—in particular they must have the same normal mode
expansion. This precludes, for example, a transition between a linear and bent triatomic
molecule (Figure 1). In the linear conﬁguration the center atom has two normal modes. In
the bent conﬁguration one of the normal mode solutions is spurious—corresponding to an
overall rotational degree of freedom. Because of this, the treatment of vibrational modes
in each conﬁguration necessitates the freezing of a diﬀerent number of degrees of freedom,
whereas when studying transitions between each conﬁguration one needs to have the same
degrees active.

One may attack this problem by using more complicated algebraic models which have
both geometries built in. In this way some parameters which before were artiﬁcially inserted
through the hybrid method become natural—i.e. since they are built in the algebra they
are determined by spectra and do not need to be ﬁt with transition data.

However,

in these more complicated algebraic models, exact Schr¨odinger correspon-
dences don’t in general exist. Thus, this approach necessitates an alternate interpretation
of algebraic parameters as geometric, conﬁguration space quantities. Recently such an in-
terpretation has been provided [7] by exploiting the many approximate correspondences
between algebraic and Schr¨odinger pictures. We use these results to develop a hybrid ap-
proach for the bent to linear transitions in Figure 1. This is most easily done by using a
spectrum generating algebra of U1(2) × U(3) × U2(2) (a U(2) for each bond and the U(3)
for the two additional degrees of freedom of the center atom). The FC transition operator
would then be ˆU = ˆt1 ⊗ ˆT ⊗ ˆt2, where ˆt1, ˆt2 are deﬁned by equation 1.3. It is the purpose
of this publication to motivate the deﬁnition of ˆT (eqn. 3.5).
We begin by demonstrating, via a coherent state limit analysis [9], that U(3) is an ap-
propriate algebra to describe the degrees of freedom of the center atom of the triatomic.
We proceed with numerical studies to study the implications and discrepancies of this in-
terpertation. Finally, we reconcile these discrepancies using [7] which naturally motivates
our deﬁnition of ˆT .

2 The Franck-Condon Problem and U (3)

2.1 Overview of U (3) Statements on 2D Problem

Th algebraic approach for 2D problems was presented by [8]. One considers symmetric
(bosonic) representations of u(3). There are two chains of interest:

U(3) ⊃ U(2) ⊃ O(2)
U(3) ⊃ O(3) ⊃ O(2)

I
II

.

(2.1)

We use the same notation as [8] for the generators except chose a diﬀerent O(3) subgroup
as explained in [7]. Please note that the O(3) group is a dynamical symmetry subgroup and
does not have the interpretation of a rotation in conﬁguration space.

The general Hamiltonian of the U(3) model is

H = ǫ ˆn + δ ˆn(ˆn + 1) + β ˆl2 − A ˆW 2,

(2.2)

where ǫ, δ, and A are taken as positive or 0. Setting A = 0 (ǫ = δ = 0) gives a Hamiltonian
with dynamical symmetry I (II). The spectra for each dynamic symmetry may be determined
from the well known solution to the branching problem for a symmetric representation of
u(3) labelled by N (the eigenvalue of the u(3) Casimir ˆn + ˆns) [8]. The basis corresponding
to chain I is labeled by the eigenvalues of the u(2) and o(2) Casimirs n and l respectively.
The basis corresponding to chain II is labeled by the o(3) Casimir’s eigenvalues, ω(ω + 1),
and again by l.

The spectra of each chain led the authors of [8] to the interpretation of each dynamical
symmetry as an azimuthally symmetric potential with minimum at 0 radius (chain I) and
at non-zero radius (chain II).

2.2 U (3) Coherent State Limit

The interpretation of [8] is reaﬃrmed by simply studying the classical coherent state limit
calculated in [7].

Taking the coherent state limit of the Hamiltonian 2.2, setting all momenta to zero and
dropping additive constants one ﬁnds the potential in group coordinates [10] to be (up to a
meaningless multiplicative factor):

where

η =

ǫ + 2δ + β − 4A(N − 1)

.

It is easy to compute the position of the potential minima

Thus we ﬁnd:

.

(2.6)

That is we have a second-order phase transition at η = 0, or equivalently 4A(N − 1) =
ǫ + 2δ + β [11].

The exact same analysis may be carried out in projective coordinates [10] revealing:

where now

(2.9)

Thus we again ﬁnd a second-order phase transition at 4A(N − 1) = ǫ + 2δ + β.
In either coordinates the potential minima moves from r = 0 (corresponding to a linear
conﬁguration) to r 6= 0 (corresponding to a bent conﬁguration) at the critical point. We
conclude that the algebraic model is rich enough to include both geometries depicted in
Figure 1. Algebraic Hamiltonians having nearly a U(2) dynamical symmetry correspond to
the center atom in a linear triatomic, whereas those near the O(3) limit correspond to the
center atom in a bent triatomic

2.3 U (3) and Schr¨odinger FC Connections

The FC factor for the two conﬁgurations is easily studied from a Schr¨odinger perspective.
Assuming that, whatever the actual nature of the potentials, they may be approximated
about their minima as harmonic we may numerically calculate the FC overlaps. The results
of such a calculation are displayed in Figure 2. The parameters (Table 2) are chosen to be
relevant to the bent to linear FC transition ( 1B2 → Σ+
g ) of CS2. The frequency of the linear
conﬁguration was taken from reference [12]. The harmonic distance scale, mω
¯h , was deduced
by assuming the eﬀective mass was that of the carbon nucleus. The radial displacement
was deduced from the geometry of the bent conﬁguration as published in reference [13]
assuming that the heavy (S − S) axis was essentially stationary. The associated distance
scale of the bent conﬁguration was assumed to be the same as the linear scale. Since CS2 is a
particularly shallow molecule we have included an additional plot (Figure 3) to demonstrate
the behavior for a larger radial displacement.

If one models the potential as exactly harmonic the displaced oscillator potential has
the idiosyncrasy of a ‘cusp’ at r = 0. This is of little concern since the eﬀective poten-
tial is dominated by the angular momentum barrier at this point. Approximate analytic
expressions may be obtained for this limit as detailed in Appendix A.

4

We wish to emphasize that although these graphs serve as a valid starting point for a
more complete analysis of CS2 transition intensities their primary purpose here is heuristic.
A full analysis requires a careful ﬁtting of the bent conﬁguration distance scale. Additionally,
the bending modes considered here are known to couple strongly to symmetric stretching
modes [12]—i.e. a full analysis would require coupling additional U(2)’s as discussed in the
introduction.

One may consider more realistic bending potentials such as a P¨oschl-Teller:

V = V0h1 − cosh−2 ¯α(r − r∗)i .

(2.10)

In this case the cusp at the origin still exists for the displaced oscillator (non-zero r∗) but
is tamed due to the long distance ﬂattening of the potential. In the limit where the minima
is far from the origin the cusp essentially vanishes. Figure 3 shows numerical results for a
P¨oschl-Teller model of a bent to linear transition. The parameters are chosen such that the
the potentials are approximated to second order by exactly the harmonic plots included in
the same ﬁgure. That is, the harmonic distance scale, α4 = 2mV0 ¯α2/¯h2 is set to the same
value as the SHO FC factors. The remaining parameter, taken as α2
¯α2 , is a unitless measure
of well depth. It was chosen to be suﬃciently small to emphasize diﬀerences between the
FC factors of the two potentials.

The previous section’s analysis implies that the FC factors for a bent to linear con-
ﬁguration in the algebraic picture are given by exactly the inner product of the algebraic
wavefunctions for hamiltonians near the O(3) chain (bent conﬁguration) and on the U(2)
chain (linear conﬁguration). The overlaps for several such ‘bent’ hamiltonians are given in
Figure 4. The algebraic ‘bent’ hamiltonian was taken to be of the form

H = (1 − ξ)ˆn −

ξ

(N − 1)

ˆW 2.

(2.11)

The parameter ξ was chosen to match the intensity maximum with that of several harmonic
Schr¨odinger calculations (corresponding to unitless radial displacements of 3, 5, and 7). The
results of calculations for two signiﬁcantly diﬀerent irreps., [N], are shown to emphasize that
the structure is generic and not a function of any special choice of parameters.

Comparing Figures 2–4 again reaﬃrms the interpretation of the two U(3) chains as bent
and linear conﬁgurations of a 2D problem. Comparing the SHO and P¨oschl-Teller ﬁgures
one notes although not in exact agreement they are very similar given the large diﬀerences
of the Schr¨odinger potentials. Qualitatively the U(3) graphs also appear similar with the
possible exceptions of (1) their (expected) truncation at higher n; (2) their dramatically
sharper peaks than the Schr¨odinger FC graphs; (3) their amplitude’s diminished sensitivity
to the amount of radial displacement.

2.4 Scale Changes

The numerical study raises two questions (1) What are the relations between the algebraic
parameters (determining the hamiltonian’s proximity to either chain) and the Schr¨odingers

5

(more geometric) parameters? (2) Is there an interpretation for the apparent qualitative
diﬀerences (the sharper peak) between the algebraic and Schr¨odinger pictures?

Both these questions can be addressed by considering the results of [7]. The two relevant
results, which we reproduce here, include the intrinsic distance scale of the harmonic approx-
imation to a Hamiltonian near the O(3) limit and an expression for the radial displacement
for the same Hamiltonian:

where X = ǫ + 2δ + β, Y = δ (N − 1), and Z = 4A (N − 1), and the condition that we
are near the O(3) limit implies X
Z is small. The parameter mω has the interpretation of the
ratio of distance to momenta scales, i.e. mω = ¯α(mV0)

2 for a potential V = V0f ( ¯αx).

1

Additionally the results of [7] imply that Hamiltonians from either dynamical symmetry
not only correspond to diﬀerent geometries as implied by 2.2 but additionaly to diﬀerent
intrinsic scales (see Appendix C):

ζn =

This implies that the algebraic overlap of a U(2) Hamiltonian with an O(3) one is not simply
analogous to the overlap of radially displaced oscillators, but analagous to the matrix ele-
ments of an operator which radially displaces and dilatates (much like the operator matrix
elements calculated in [2]) changing the natural scale of the problem. The degree of dilata-
tion depends on the proximity of the second hamiltonian to either chain. For chains near
U(2) the dilatation paramater is essentially 1. As one moves nearer to the O(3) chain the
dilatation parameter increases, approaching the value given by equation 2.14. This eﬀect
must be accounted for in any algebraic or hybrid approach to the FC problem.

We saw in the introduction that in the 1D problem the scale parameters may have been
thought as harmonic scale parameters with corrections linear in the quantum number n of
order 1/N. The scenario is similar here—except the quantum number is now n and there
are additional corrections of the larger order log N/N.

2.5 Schr¨odinger and Algebraic Parameter Relations

Equations 2.12 and 2.13 for the harmonic dilatation and radial displacement establish the
needed connection between algebraic and geometrical parameters—at least in the regime

6

where we are near the O(3) limit. These quantities can be easily related to experimental
data.

Experimentally one can ﬁnd the lower energy level spacing ∆Eexp, the reduced mass of
the particle mexp, and from rotational spectra the distance of displacement rexp. In terms
of these quantities one may compute the unitless distance using the harmonic oscillator
dilatation

(2.17)

This could be very valuable when ﬁtting spectra. Since the O(3) chain represents the
‘maximum’ radial displacement [7] this expression gives a lower bound for N. One may
begin ﬁtting data for the N which satisﬁes this equation with the corrections set equal to
0. If the O(3) chain spectra with this N doesn’t ﬁt the experimental data then one can try
higher N and move oﬀ the O(3) chain a corresponding amount so that the equation with
the corrections is still satisﬁed.

3 2-D Franck-Condon Problem: The Prescription

3.1 Adding Dilatations

We are now ready to develop a prescription for calculating the FC factors for a U(3) algebraic
model. We begin by considering the FC problem of two conﬁgurations of a molecule both
described by the U(2) chain—i.e. two linear triatomics. Following the 1D procedure we
propose a hybrid approach based upon calculating the matrix elements of the operator ˆT
deﬁned in terms of 2D SHO Schr¨odinger overlaps:

h[N′], n′, l| ˆT|[N], n, li = Tn,n′,l(

α
α′

)

(3.1)

The appropriate overlaps are calculated in Appendix D (equations D.3 and D.2). ˆT by
construction does not connect subspaces of diﬀerent l.

3.2 Final Procedure

We have yet to add any dependance on the representation label N. One could add such
dependance by hand, appealing to an analogy with the 1D case. However, when one has a
bent to linear transition such an appeal is largely unnecessary due to equation 2.14.

For simplicity suppose we have a molecule with a bent conﬁguration whose spectra is ﬁt
by a hamiltonian of the O(3) chain in representation N and a linear conﬁguration whose
spectra is ﬁt by the U(2) dynamical symmetry with δ = β = 0 (in this scenario the second

7

representation label N′ can be arbitrary since the hamiltonian will generate identical low
lying (experimentally measurable) spectra regardless of N′). Further, suppose the induced
harmonic dilatations α and α′ (given by equation 2.16) can be calculated. In this instance
we know that expanding the O(3) basis in terms of the U(2) basis is equivalent to expanding
2ζnα2 (where ζn is determined by 2.14).
in terms of a SHO with harmonic dilatation α2
Thus the FC transitions should be the matrix elements:
h[N′], n′, l| ˆT|[N], ω, li,

(3.3)

Expanding in large N we see q 1
2ζn = a + bn from equation 2.14 where b is O( 1
N ) and a
has constant contributions and log N
N contributions. With the exception that a 6= 1 this is
exactly the correction one has in the 1D case. That is, we have just let α → α(a + bn).
In this extreme case the FC factors can be calculated with no extra ﬁtting parameters.
However, our calculations depended on expansions in large N [7] and thus we would expect
them to be inaccurate for larger n. This can be compensated for phenomelogically by
allowing b to be ﬁt to compensate for ignored terms.

Although the above situation is only for a limiting case, these results (along with insight

from the 1D analysis) will imply exactly what will happen in other more realistic cases.

• Bent conﬁguration near the O(3) basis: One can in principle calculate the scale
dependance near O(3): mω|OﬀO(3) ≈ mω|O(3)(1 + ν X
Z ) where ν and µ would
have to be determined by repeating the calculation of [7] to second order. In such
a calculation, it is clear that the result will go like α → α(˜a + ˜bn + ˜dl2), where
Z ); the new parameter ˜d,
˜a = a(1 + γ) and γ is O( X
introducing l dependence, is O( X
ZN 2 ); and we have ignored a n-l cross term which
is of a signiﬁcantly smaller order. Although these coeﬃcients could be calculated in
principle, one must phenomenologically ﬁt ˜b and ˜d in order to describe higher states
anyways. Since the l dependance is of lower order it seems likely that ˜d may not even
be calculable with todays data.

• Linear conﬁguration in U(2) basis but δ 6= 0: In this instance the u(2) requan-
tization was approximate and inadequate for higher eigenstates. However, compar-
ing the spectra to a Dunham expansion one sees that δ
ǫ plays the role of an anhar-
monicity parameter (recall equation 2.2). Thus, from the 1D case one concludes that
α′ → α′(1 + b′(n + 1)) where b′ must be ﬁt but should be of the order of δ
ǫ .

• Either conﬁguration far from both chains: Although our scheme has not allowed
us to do explicit calculations in this regime, in terms of phenomologically ﬁt parameters
the result should still be clear. One should replace the induced harmonic dilatation

8

by α → α(˜a + ˜b(n + 1) + ˜dl2). In this scenario ˜a should be between 1 and a depending
on the proximity to either chain, ˜b has contributions due to both δ anharmonicities
and the O(3) chain, and one again expects that ˜d is of signiﬁcantly smaller order. In
this regime all parameters must be ﬁt to data.

Let us recapitulate. The scheme we propose involves ﬁtting the spectra of each conﬁgu-
ration of the molecule in a U(3) model to obtain wavefunctions |[N], ψEi, |[N′], ψ′E′i. The
FC factors are then
(3.4)

h[N′], ψ′E′| ˆT|[N], ψEi

where we deﬁne ˆT in terms of the U(2) basis:

h[N′], n′, l′| ˆT|[N], n, li = δl,l′ Tn,n′,l  α(˜a + ˜b(n + 1) + ˜dl2)

α′(˜a′ + ˜b′(n′ + 1) + ˜d′l2)! .

(3.5)

In general the parameters must be ﬁt, but whenever any of the limiting cases appear the
appropriate theoretical values may be substituted. For example, if the linear conﬁguration is
highly harmonic one has ˜a′ = 1 and ˜b′ = ˜d′ = 0. Further, since we expect the l2 dependance
to be nearly negligible and we have a l = l′ selection rule, we may expand and combine ˜d
and ˜d′ into one parameter.

Note that this scheme may also be used for bent to bent transitions. This would be
more useful than the 1D procedure [2,3] if one was interested in the l dependance of the
transitions for instance.

4 Conclusions

Using the result of [7] involving the geometry and scales of the dynamical symmetries of
U(3) we have explained the diﬀerence one sees when considering FC overlaps as described by
the U(3) algebra and FC overlaps as described by radially displaced Schr¨odinger oscillators.
Additionally, the analysis has given us the practical result of a minimum value of N as a
function of simple experimentally measured quantities.

We observed that this scale dependency leads very naturally to a description of two di-
mensional FC factors. To compute the FC factors one expands the algebraic wavefunction in
the U(2) basis and formally replaces the basis element’s overlap by the 2D SHO Schr¨odinger
overlap. Corrections for N, anharmonicities, and even l dependance are made by letting
the SHO dilatation constant have n and l2 dependent contributions. The resulting formulas
are analogous to the 1D results obtained by expanding in anharmonicities.

Notice, that this mild transformation will greatly change the form of the solutions (as
opposed to the 1D case) since the laplacian is not invariant under radial displacements. Note
that towards the origin the potential is ‘heightwise truncated’ (in full 2-space the potential
is not diﬀerentiable at the origin). Thus, to harmonically approximate the potential we
must assure that we are suﬃciently far from the origin, i.e. loosely λ′r2

0 must be large.

the bent conﬁguration is:

(A.8)

Although this solution is singular at the origin this is of little concern since the metric
contains a factor of r (the real objects of interest are √rv(r), of which we have a good
approximation).

A.3 Franck-Condon Factors

We wish to calculate the overlap of wavefunctions from a linear and bent conﬁguration.
Given the SO(2) symmetry of both conﬁgurations the angular part of the wavefunctions
simply gives the δl,l′ selection rule. Hence, the integral we wish to evaluate is

r = Mn′

2 r2

L|l|nr (λr2)Hn′

r(q¯λ(r − r∗)),

(A.9)

where we introduced the short hand M and N for the normalizations.

We remove all dimensionful quantities by making the change of variable u = √λr.
λ = 1 + δ

Additionally we decide to work in the (realistic) domain where λ ≈ λ′ by setting λ′
where δ is small. Using expressions from [2] for the expansion

Hs(α(x − x0)) = X0≤n≤s

tn,s(α, − x0)Hn(x),

Not surprisingly the dominant term is independent of δ (reﬂecting the fact that FC integrals
tend to be more sensitive to changes in displacement than to dilatation). Evaluating the

B Schr¨odinger and Algebraic Quantum Numbers

In the preceding sections for each l = 0,±1,±2 . . . we have that nr = 0, 1, 2, . . . with
the energy relation E ∝ |l| + 2nr. For the u(2) chain of the u(3) model with hamiltonian
H = E0 + kˆn (the algebraic model most similar to the 2D SHO) we have as a spectra E ∝ n.
The branching rules imply that for each l = 0,±1,±2 . . . we have n = |l|,|l| + 2,|l| + 4, . . ..
Note that both the expressions for the spectra and the rules for the ranges of the quantum
numbers agree if we make the identiﬁcation:

nr =

n − |l|

2

.

(B.1)

Thus the wavefunction with lowest energy within a subspace of given l is labelled by nr = 0
in the Schr¨odinger picture and n = |l| in the algebraic picture.

C Scale Changes

Our equation 2.14 diﬀers from the results of [7] by the substitution |l| → n. This diﬀerence
occurs because [7] did not compute overlaps for higher energy wavefunctions since its ap-
proximation was most valid in the low energy limit. However, their requantization technique
works exactly for all levels of the U(2) chain when δ = 0. We therefore may expect these
higher energy wavefunctions to be more reliable and repeat their procedure to calculate the
scale change for all levels in this larger domain. Proceeding to do so one ﬁnds that the
linear |l| dependance of equation 2.14 was an artifact of working in the ground state of each
|l| subspace and the true correspondence has linear contributions appearing in n.

D Schr¨odinger FC Factors for dilatated r∗ = 0 Har-

monic Potentials

Using the solution to the radial part of the Schr¨odinger equation for the 2D SHO stated in
Appendix A the FC overlaps for a dilatated SHO become:

Figure 1: The geometry and radial potentials (of the central atom) of a triatomic model.
In the linear conﬁguration (a) the potential has a true minima at r = 0 (the Hessian is
positive deﬁnite) and there is a normal mode for each of the two degrees of freedom. In
the bent conﬁguration (b) the potential has a continuous manifold of minima along a circle
surrounding the origin (the Hessian has one positive and one 0 eigenvalue). There is only
one non-spurious normal mode (radial vibrations or bending modes). The second mode is
lost to the overall rotational degree of freedom.

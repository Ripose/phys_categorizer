Abstract

We present a simple method for measuring the gain
decay time in a conjugated polymer ﬁlm by optically
exciting the ﬁlm with two mutually delayed ultrashort
pump pulses. When the pump is set at such a power
level that ampliﬁed spontaneous emission marginally
develops along the polymer waveguide, the total out-
put emitted from its edge decays exponentially as a
function of the interpulse delay. The corresponding
decay time represents the decay time of the gain of the
polymer material.
Conjugated polymers are believed to carry great
promise for application as gain material in organic
solid-state lasers. They cover the whole visible spec-
tral range and oﬀer the prospect of being electrically
driven. Recently, a ﬁrst electrically driven organic laser
has been realized using a crystalline material [1], but
lasing from conjugated polymers has so far only been
achieved in an optically pumped device.
In the ﬁrst
optically pumped thin-ﬁlm polymer laser a planar mi-
crocavity was employed [2]. Since then various other
optically driven polymer lasers have been reported, us-
ing a variety of cavity conﬁgurations [3, 4, 5].

In a planar microcavity, a polymer layer is sand-
wiched between two highly reﬂecting mirrors. The laser
light then propagates perpendicular to the active layer,
just as in a vertical-cavity surface-emitting semicon-
ductor laser. In this conﬁguration the gain length is
limited by the thickness of the layer or the absorption
length of the pump light (which usually doesn’t ex-
ceed 100 nm). Contrary, this limit doesn’t occur for
conﬁgurations in which the generated ﬁeld propagates
along the polymer ﬁlm, acting as a waveguide. In this
case the gain length is determined by the dimensions
of the excitation beam, which oﬀers the possibility to
generate strong ampliﬁed spontaneous emission (ASE)
along the waveguide, even in the absence of any feed-
back [6, 7].

To characterize the suitability of a speciﬁc conju-
gated polymer ﬁlm for laser applications, the gain and

loss and their corresponding dynamics need to be mea-
sured. The pump-probe technique has proven to be
especially powerful here, providing a tool to measure
stimulated emission and photoinduced absorption on a
sub-picosecond time scale [8, 9, 10, 11]. In this tech-
nique, the polymer ﬁlm is excited with a femtosecond
pump pulse and the resulting change in optical trans-
mission (∆T /T ) is measured as a function of time by
probing the excited region with a very weak, delayed,
ultrashort probe pulse. Usually the probe pulse has
a very broad spectrum, allowing spectrally resolved
measurements of stimulated emission (∆T /T > 0) and
photoinduced absorption (∆T /T < 0). In addition to
yielding the actual value of ∆T /T at zero delay for all
probe wavelengths, this technique also provides data on
the variation of ∆T /T as a function of time. Specif-
ically, one can determine the decay time of the stim-
ulated emission. In order to achieve lasing in a given
device, this decay time should at least exceed the time
that is needed for the laser ﬁeld to build up in this
device.
In solid polymer ﬁlms ∆T /T usually dimin-
ishes on a time scale much shorter than the photolumi-
nescence lifetime of the polymer. Various mechanisms
which have been heavily discussed in literature lie at
the root of this fast decay [10, 12, 13, 14]. These in-
clude photo-oxidation [15], ﬁlm morphology [16] and
pump intensity [11].

In this Letter we put forward a new and simple
method for measuring the decay time of the gain in thin
solid ﬁlms of a conjugated polymer. We employ the
waveguide conﬁguration and excite the ﬁlm in a pencil-
shaped region using two pump pulses, with a variable
interpulse delay. We measure the time-integrated out-
put of the optically excited stripe as a function of in-
terpulse delay. We directly extract the gain decay time
from these measurements.

Our sample is made by spin coating a heated and
stirred solution of a poly-(p-phenylene vinylene) (PPV)
copolymer in toluene (5 mg/ml) on top of a glass sub-
strate. The copolymer, referred to as HB1221, consists
of four diﬀerent phenyl-PPVs (25% each); the chemi-
cal structure and synthesis route have been published

a gated integrator. Notwithstanding the absence of a
feedback structure, the curve shows a clear threshold
around 5 nJ. In the vicinity of this point the input-
output curve is highly nonlinear. We will employ this
nonlinearity to obtain insight into the dynamics of the
gain.

in Ref. [17]. The substrate-ﬁlm-air stack (with refrac-
tive indices ηglass = 1.46, ηpoly ≈ 1.7 and ηair = 1,
respectively) forms an asymmetrical waveguide with a
thickness of ≈100 nm, supporting the propagation of
the fundamental TE-mode [7]. After spin coating the
substrate is broken in order to access the more homoge-
neous part of the ﬁlm in the middle of the substrate and
to create a sample with relatively sharp edges. We ex-
cite the ﬁlm with two ultrashort pump pulses (≈ 130 fs,
λ = 400 nm, 1 kHz repetition rate), one being delayed
relative to the other. We shape the excitation beam
using lenses and a slit to make the intensity distribu-
tion homogeneous. Subsequently it is focussed into a
stripe of 1 × 0.02 mm on the sample. We measure the
light emitted along the stripe. The setup is shown in
the inset of Fig. 1.

output as emitted from the edge of the waveguide mea-
sured as a function of the pump energy.

The output spectral power on one side of the stripe

with length l is given by:

P (λ, t) = A(λ)

(e(g(λ,t)−α)l − 1).

(1)

g(λ, t)
g(λ, t) − α

Here, g(λ, t) represents the net optical gain, as induced
by the pump pulse. The linear absorption in the waveg-
uide is denoted by α; A(λ) is related to the photolumi-
nescence spectral power per unit wavelength. The op-
tical gain is associated with the presence of primary ex-
citons, which may be described as a four-level system.
The gain decay time is determined by radiative and
nonradiative decay of the exciton population. Eq. (1)
has been derived from the laser rate equations, assum-
ing that the gain decays slowly as compared to the
single-pass transit time along the stripe (≈ 5 ps); the
latter time will be neglected henceforth. Because we
use ultrashort pump pulses, the gain coeﬃcient is at its
maximum value at t = 0 and subsequently diminishes.
We assume the gain decays via a single exponential.

In order to measure the decay time of the gain in our
waveguide we excite the polymer ﬁlm at such a power
level that there is very little stimulated emission, the
output being dominated by spontaneous emission (e.g.
at 4 nJ, see Fig 2). After some delay we reexcite the
ﬁlm with a second pump pulse, identical to the ﬁrst.
We measure the time-integrated signal emitted by the
stripe upon this dual-pulse excitation as a function of
the interpulse delay. For excitation with two pump
pulses of equal intensity, having an interpulse delay
∆τ , the emission is given by Eq.(1), with:

Figure 1: Emission spectra measured for various pump
energies. The dashed curve shows the spontaneous-
emission spectrum that is emitted from the surface
of the waveguide for very low pump intensity. The
solid and long-dashed curves show the output emitted
from the edge of the waveguide at high pump energy
(> 10 nJ) and some intermediate pump energy, respec-
tively.

First we provide some characteristics of the polymer
waveguide under single-pulse excitation. The spectrum
of the emitted light is shown in Fig. 1 for a range
of pump energies. At low pulse energy (< 1 nJ) the
broad photoluminescence spectrum of the polymer ﬁlm
is observed (dashed curve). When the pulse energy
is increased a narrow peak develops at λ = 548 nm
(long-dashed curve), which completely comes to domi-
nate the output at even higher pump energies (10 nJ,
solid curve). Another characteristic is the input-output
curve of the stripe as shown in Fig. 2. It shows the tem-
porally and spectrally integrated output that is emit-
ted from the edge of the polymer ﬁlm. The signal is
measured with a slow photodiode in combination with

output, since in the long-delay limit the two output
pulses become independent.

Here gd(λ, t) represents the double-pulse gain coeﬃ-
cient, while the gain upon single-pulse excitation is rep-
resented by gs(λ, t). We now deﬁne Us and Ud(∆τ ) as
the output energies at the edge of the ﬁlm for single
and double pulse excitation, respectively. The output
energy is obtained by integrating P (λ, t) over both time
and wavelength. When the delay is much longer than
the decay time of the gain, the time-integrated double-
pulse output simply equals twice the single-pulse out-
put (Ud(∆τ ) = 2Us). However, when the delay is short,
the double pulse output Ud(∆τ ) is larger than 2Us be-
cause of the nonlinearity of Eq.(1). This is most easily
seen at zero delay. The input-output curve immedi-
ately shows that the output at 8 nJ pump energy is
considerably larger than twice the output at 4 nJ. It is
easy to show that, for 0 < (gs(0) − α)l < 1, the excess
output

decays exponentially as a function of the interpulse de-

ticular, it can be shown that the decay rate of Uexcess
directly yields the decay rate of the gain coeﬃcient
gs(t).

excitation (4 nJ/pulse), measured as a function of the

In Fig. 3 we show the time-integrated output that is
emitted from the edge of our substrate as a function of
the interpulse delay at a single-pulse excitation energy
of 4 nJ/pulse (≈ 20 µJ/cm2). As expected, the curve is
symmetrical with respect to zero delay. The ﬁtted ex-
ponentials (dashed curves), are in excellent agreement
with the experimental data, indicating that the excess
output indeed decays exponentially, the decay time be-
ing ≈ 40 ps. The gain coeﬃcient is thus estimated to
have a decay time of ≈ 40 ps as well. The asymptotic
values of the ﬁts correspond to twice the single pulse

Figure 4: Measurement of the decay time of the gain
at 548 nm using the pump-probe technique for a pump
intensity of ≈ 80 µJ/cm2. The dashed line represents
a single exponential curve ﬁt.

In order to check the validity of our approach we have
also applied the conventional pump-probe technique
to our sample, again using a low excitation density
(≈ 80 µJ/cm2). The probe wavelength has been set
at λ = 548 nm (gain maximum), the same wavelength
as selected by the gain medium when ASE develops in
the waveguide. The results are shown in Fig. 4, repre-
senting a single exponential decay of 43 ps, in excellent
agreement with the result obtained with the method
introduced in this Letter.

Our technique thus provides a reliable tool to mea-
sure the decay time of the gain in a thin ﬁlm of light-
emitting polymers. The primary advantage of the tech-
nique introduced here is its simplicity. No white-light
generation is required and due to the long gain length,
the signals are large. This makes the method well
suited for studying systems that exhibit very small
gain. Moreover the gain decay time is automatically
measured at the wavelength at which the net gain is
maximum and stimulated emission will build up.

In conclusion, when pumping a polymer waveguide
with two excitation pulses at such a power level that
the excitation energy of a single pump pulse is just
below the threshold value for ASE, the total output
upon double pulse excitation strongly depends on the
interpulse delay. We have shown that this behavior
can be exploited to measure the decay time of the gain
in a very simple way: the total output emitted from
the edge of the waveguide decays exponentially as a
function of the interpulse delay with a characteristic
time that represents the decay time of the gain.

Abstract

Two new schemes for computing molecular total atomization energies (TAEs)

and/or heats of formation (∆H ◦

f ) of ﬁrst-and second-row compounds to very

high accuracy are presented. The more aﬀordable scheme, W1 (Weizmann-

1) theory, yields a mean absolute error of 0.30 kcal/mol and includes only a

single, molecule-independent, empirical parameter.

It requires CCSD (cou-

pled cluster with all single and double substitutions) calculations in spdf and

spdf g basis sets, while CCSD(T) [i.e. CCSD with a quasiperturbative treat-

ment of connected triple excitations] calculations are only required in spd and

spdf basis sets. On workstation computers and using conventional coupled

cluster algorithms, systems as large as benzene can be treated, while larger

systems are feasible using direct coupled cluster methods. The more rigorous

scheme, W2 (Weizmann-2) theory, contains no empirical parameters at all

and yields a mean absolute error of 0.23 kcal/mol, which is lowered to 0.18

kcal/mol for molecules dominated by dynamical correlation. It involves CCSD

calculations in spdf g and spdf gh basis sets and CCSD(T) calculations in spdf

and spdf g basis sets. On workstation computers, molecules with up to three

heavy atoms can be treated using conventional coupled cluster algorithms,

1

while larger systems can still be treated using a direct CCSD code. Both

schemes include corrections for scalar relativistic eﬀects, which are found to

be vital for accurate results on second-row compounds.

I. INTRODUCTION

Thermochemical data such as molecular heats of formation are among the most crucial

quantitative chemical data. Thanks to great progress made in recent years in both methodol-

ogy and computer technology, a broad range of empirical, semiempirical, density functional,

and ab initio schemes now exist for this purpose (for a recent collection of reviews, see Ref.

[1]).

At present, only ab initio-based methods can claim ‘chemical accuracy’ (±1 kcal/mol).

The most popular such schemes are undoubtedly the G2 [2] and G3 [3] theories of Pople and

coworkers (which are based on a combination of additivity approximations and empirical

corrections applied to relatively low-level calculations), followed by the CBS-Q [4–6] and

CBS/APNO [4] methods which are intricate combinations of extrapolation and empirical

correction schemes. With the exception of CBS/APNO (which allows for 0.5 kcal/mol ac-

curacy, on average [7], but is restricted to ﬁrst-row compounds), all these schemes allow for

mean absolute errors of about 1 kcal/mol, although errors for some individual molecules (e.g.

SO2, SiF4 [3]) can be much larger (e.g. about 8–12 kcal/mol for SiF4 using G2 theory, and

4 kcal/mol using G3 theory [8]).

In fact, many of the experimental data in the ”enlarged G2 set” [9] employed in the

parametrization of several of these methods (notably G3 theory and several of the more

recent density functional methods [10]) themselves carry experimental uncertainties larger

than 1 kcal/mol.

The aim pursued in the present work is a more ambitious one than chemical accuracy. In

light of the prevalent use of kJ/mol units in the leading thermochemical tables compendia

(JANAF [11] and CODATA [12]), we shall arbitrarily deﬁne a mean absolute error of one

2

such unit, i.e. 0.24 kcal/mol, as ‘calibration accuracy’ — with the additional constraint that

no individual error be larger than the ‘chemical accuracy’ goal of 1 kcal/mol.

One of us [13,14] has recently shown that this goal is achievable for small polyatomics

using present technology. The approach followed employed explicit treatment of inner-shell

correlation [15], coupled cluster calculations in augmented basis sets of spdf g and spdf gh

quality, and extrapolation of the valence correlation contribution to the atomization energy

using formulas [13] based on the known asymptotic convergence behavior [16–18] of pair

correlation energies. In this manner, total atomization energies (TAEe) of about 15 ﬁrst-row

diatomics and polyatomics for which experimental data are known to about 0.1 kcal/mol

could be determined to within 0.25 kcal/mol on average without any empirical parameters.

(Upon introducing an empirical correction for A–N bonds, this could be improved to 0.13

kcal/mol, clearly within the target.) In fact, using this method, an experimental controversy

concerning the heat of formation of gaseous boron — a quantity that enters any ab initio

or semiempirical calculation of the heat of formation of any boron compound — could be

resolved [19] by a benchmark calculation of the total atomization energy of BF3.

Benchmark studies along similar lines by several other groups (e.g. those of Helgaker [20],

Bauschlicher [21], Dunning [22]) point in the same direction. Among those, Bauschlicher [21]

was the ﬁrst to suggest that the inclusion of scalar relativistic corrections may in fact be

essential for accurate results on second-row molecules.

High-accuracy results on second-row compounds can only be achieved in this manner —

as has been shown repeatedly [23,24,21] — if high-exponent d and f functions are added to

the basis set. As shown by one of us [23], these ‘inner shell polarization functions’ address an

SCF-level eﬀect which bears little relationship to inner-shell correlation, and actually dwarfs

the latter in importance (contributions as high as 10 kcal/mol having been reported [23,8]).

All these approaches carry a dual disadvantage: their extravagant computational cost

and their reliance on the quantum chemical expertise of the operator.

The target of the present study was to develop computational procedures that meet the

3

following requirements:

• they should have mean absolute errors on the order of 0.25 kcal/mol or less, and

problem molecules (if any) should be readily identiﬁable;

• the method should be applicable to at least ﬁrst-and second-row molecules;

• it should be robust enough to be applicable in a fairly ‘black-box’ fashion by a non-

specialist;

• it should rely as little as possible (preferably not at all) on empirical parameters,

empirical additivity corrections, or other ‘fudges’ derived from experimental data;

• relatedly, it should explicitly include all the physical eﬀects that are liable to aﬀect

molecular binding energies of ﬁrst-and second-row compounds, rather than rely upon

absorbing them in empirical parametrization;

• last but not least, it should be suﬃciently cost-eﬀective that a molecule the size of,

e.g., benzene should be treatable on a workstation computer.

In the course of this work, we will present two schemes which we shall denote W1 and

W2 (for Weizmann-1 and Weizmann-2) theories. W2 theory yields about 0.2 kcal/mol (or

better) accuracy for ﬁrst-and second-row molecules with up to four heavy atoms, and in-

volves no empirical parameters. W1 theory is applicable to larger systems (we shall present

benzene and trans-butadiene as examples), yet still yields a mean absolute error of about

0.30 kcal/mol and includes only a single, molecule-independent, empirical parameter which

moreover is derived from calculated rather than experimental results.

II. COMPUTATIONAL DETAILS

Most electronic structure calculations reported in this work were carried out using MOL-

PRO 97.3 [25] and MOLPRO 98.1 [26] running on a Silicon Graphics (SGI) Octane work-

station and on the SGI Origin 2000 of the Faculty of Chemistry. The full CCSDT (coupled

4

cluster with all connected single, double, and triple substitutions [27]) calculations were

carried out using ACES II [28] running on a DEC Alpha 500/500 workstation.

SCF and valence correlation calculations were carried out using correlation consistent

[29,30] polarized n-tuple zeta (cc-pVnZ, or VnZ for short) (n=D, T, Q, 5, 6) and augmented

correlation consistent [31] polarized n-tuple zeta (aug-cc-pVnZ, or AVnZ for short) (n=D, T,

Q, 5, 6) basis sets of Dunning and coworkers. The maximum angular momentum parameter l,

which occurs in the extrapolation formulas for the correlation energy, is identiﬁed throughout

with the n in VnZ and AVnZ. Except for the calculation of the electron aﬃnity of hydrogen,

regular VnZ basis sets were used throughout on hydrogen atoms.

Most valence correlation calculations were carried out using the CCSD (coupled clus-

ter with all single and double substitutions [32]) and CCSD(T) (i.e. CCSD followed by

a quasiperturbative estimate of the eﬀect of connected triple excitations [33,34]) electron

correlation methods. The CCSD(T) method is known [35] to be very close to an exact solu-

tion within the given one-particle basis set if the wave function is dominated by dynamical

correlation.

Where possible, imperfections in the treatment of connected triple excitations were es-

timated by comparing with full CCSDT calculations. The eﬀect of connected quadruple

and higher excitations were estimated by small basis set FCI (full conﬁguration interaction)

calculations — which represent exact solutions with a ﬁnite basis set.

Inner-shell correlation contributions were evaluated by taking the diﬀerence between

valence-only and all-electron CCSD(T) calculations in special core-correlation basis sets.

For ﬁrst-row compounds, both Dunning’s ACVQZ (augmented correlation consistent core-

valence quadruple zeta [36]) basis set and the Martin-Taylor (MT) core correlation basis sets

[37,15] were considered; for second-row compounds only the MT basis sets. The latter are

generated by completely decontracting a CVnZ or ACVnZ basis set, and adding one tight

p function, three high-exponent d functions, two high-exponent f functions, and (in the

case of the MTv5z basis set) one high-exponent g function to the basis set. The additional

5

exponents were derived from the highest ones already present for the respective angular

momenta, successively multiplied by 3.0. The smallest such basis set, MTvtz (based on

VTZ) is also simply denoted MT.

Scalar relativistic corrections were calculated at the ACPF (averaged coupled pair func-

tional [38]) level as expectation values of the ﬁrst-order Darwin and mass-velocity terms

[39,40]. An idea of the reliability of this approach is given by comparing a very recent rela-

tivistic (Douglas-Kroll [41]) coupled cluster calculation [42] of the relativistic contribution to

TAE[SiH4], −0.67 kcal/mol, with the identical value of −0.67 kcal/mol obtained by means of

the present approach. For GaCl, GaCl2, and GaCl3 — where relativistic eﬀects are an order

of magnitude stronger than even in the second-row systems considered here — Bauschlicher

[43] found that diﬀerences between Douglas-Kroll calculations and the presently followed

approach amounted to 0.12 kcal/mol or less on the binding energy.

Spin-orbit coupling constants were evaluated at the CASSCF-CI level using the spdf part

of the MTav5z basis set. (For a recent review of the methodology involved, see Ref. [44].)

Density functional calculations for the purposes of obtaining certain reference geometries

and zero-point energies were carried out using the Gaussian 98 [45] package. Both the B3LYP

(Becke 3-parameter [46]-Lee-Yang-Parr [47]) and B3PW91 (Becke 3-parameter [46]-Perdew-

Wang-1991 [48]) exchange-correlation functionals were considered.

Most geometry optimizations were carried out at either the CCSD(T)/VQZ+1 or the

B3LYP/VTZ+1 (in some cases B3PW91/VTZ+1) levels of theory, where the notation

VnZ+1 indicates the addition to all second-row atoms of a single high-exponent d-type

‘inner polarization function’ [49,23] with an exponent equal to the highest d exponent in the

Dunning V5Z basis set. In the past this was found [49,23,50,51] to recover the largest part of

the eﬀects of inner polarization on geometries and vibrational frequencies. (We note that for

molecules consisting of ﬁrst-row atoms only, the VnZ+1 basis sets are equivalent to regular

VnZ basis sets.)

Past studies [52–54] of the convergence behavior of the SCF energy have shown it to be

6

very well described by a geometric extrapolation of the type ﬁrst proposed by Feller [55],

A + B/C l. Clearly, for this purpose a succession of three SCF/AVnZ basis sets is required.

For the valence correlation CCSD and (T) energies, two extrapolation formulas were

considered. The ﬁrst, A+ B/(l + 1/2)α, was proposed by Martin [13] — the philosophy being

that using the extrapolation exponent as an adjustable parameter would enable inclusion of

higher-order terms in the asymptotic expansion

A/(L + 1)3 + B/(L + 1)4 + C/(L + 1)5 + ...

(1)

while the denominator shift of 1/2 was a compromise — for identiﬁcation of the l in cc-

pVlZ with L — between hydrogen and nonhydrogen atoms. The second formula, simply

A + B/l3, was proposed by Helgaker and coworkers [56] — where l was identiﬁed with L − 1

throughout. Halkier et al. [56] already noted that in terms of the extrapolated energy using

A + B/(l + C)D, the parameters C and D were very strongly coupled, and that it only made

sense to vary one of them.

The combination of treatments for SCF, CCSD valence correlation, (T), imperfections

in the T treatment, and connected quadruple and higher excitations is compactly denoted

here by W[p5;p4;p3;p2;p1], in which p1 denotes the basis sets involved in the SCF ex-

trapolation, p2 the basis sets involved in the CCSD extrapolation, p3 those in the (T)

extrapolation (which may or may not be diﬀerent from p2), p4 (if present) the basis sets

used in correcting for imperfections in the treatment of connected triple excitations, and

p5 (if present) those involved in evaluating the eﬀect of connected quadruple and higher

excitations.

If any of the p’s consists of a single index, a simple additivity approxima-

tion is implied; two indices denote a two-parameter extrapolation of the type A + B/l3,

while three indices indicate a three-parameter extrapolation of the type A + B/(l + 1/2)α

in the case of correlation contributions, and A + B/C l

in the case of SCF contribu-

tions. For example, the level of theory used in the previous work of Martin and Taylor

would be W[TQ5;TQ5;TQ5] in the present notation, while W[D;Q;TQ5;TQ5;TQ5] indicates

W[TQ5;TQ5;TQ5]+CCSDT/AVQZ-CCSD(T)/AVQZ+FCI/AVDZ-CCSDT/AVDZ.

III. ATOMIC ELECTRON AFFINITIES AS A ‘LITMUS TEST’

The electron aﬃnities of the ﬁrst-and second-row atoms have often been used as bench-

marks for high-level electronic structure methods (see e.g. the introductions to Refs. [57,58]

for reviews). Because electron aﬃnities involve a change in the number of electrons correlated

in the system, they are very taxing tests for any electron correlation method; in addition,

they involve a pronounced change in the spatial extent of the wave function, making them

very demanding in terms of the basis set as well.

Until recently, three of the ﬁrst-and second-row atomic electron aﬃnities were imprecisely

known experimentally (B, Al, and Si): this situation was changed very recently by high-

precision measurements for recent experiments for B [59], Al [60,61], and Si [62].

The approach we have chosen here for the SCF and valence correlation compo-

nents is summarized in our notation as W[n,Q,56,56,Q56] for the ﬁrst-row atoms, and

W[n,Q,Q5,Q5,TQ5] for the second-row atoms. The eﬀect of inner-shell correlations was

assessed at the CCSD(T)/MTav5z level, while Darwin and mass-velocity corrections were

evaluated at the ACPF/MTav5z level. Finally, spin-orbit splittings were calculated at the

CASSCF-CI level with the spdf part of a MTav5z basis set. (For technical reasons, the h

functions were omitted in both the scalar relativistic and spin-orbit calculations, as were the

g functions in the latter.)

Our best computed results are compared with experiment in Table I, where results from

recent calibration studies are also summarized.

Agreement between computed and observed values can be described without reservation

as excellent: the mean absolute error amounts to 0.0009 eV. The fact that this accuracy is

obtained systematically and across the board strongly suggest that the ’right result was ob-

tained for the right reason’. Upon eliminating the corrections for imperfections in CCSD(T),

i.e. restricting ourselves to W[56,56,Q56] for ﬁrst-row atoms and W[Q5,Q5,TQ5] for second-

row atoms, the mean absolute error increases by an order of magnitude to 0.009 eV, i.e.

about 0.2 kcal/mol. As we shall see below, this is essentially the type of accuracy we can

8

obtain for molecules without corrections for CCSD(T) imperfections.

The importance of Darwin and mass-velocity corrections increases, as expected, with

increasing Z, and its contribution becomes quite nontrivial for atoms like Cl. It is therefore

to be expected that, e.g., in polar second-row molecules like ClCN or SO2 they will contribute

substantially to TAE as well.

The importance of inner-shell correlation eﬀects is actually largest for Al, because of the

small gap between valence and sub-valence orbitals in the early second-row elements.

Table II compares the convergence behavior of the extrapolated valence correlation con-

tributions as a function of the largest basis set used, both using the Martin three-term and

Helgaker two-term formulas. While both formulas appear to give the same answer if the un-

derlying basis sets are large enough, the two-term formula is by far the more stable towards

reduction of the basis sets used in the extrapolation. Since the use of W[Q56,Q56,Q56] is

hardly an option for molecules, the two-term formula appears to be the formula of choice.

Following the suggestion of a referee, we have considered (Table II) the performance of

some other extrapolation formulas for the valence correlation energy. As a point of reference,

we have taken an “experimental valence correlation contribution to EA”, which we derived

by subtracting all computed contributions other than the valence correlation energy from

the best experimental EAs. While some residual uncertainties may remain in some of the

individual contributions, these should be reliable to 0.001 eV on average.

As seen in Table II, performance of the geometric series extrapolation [55] A + B/C n is

outright poor: in fact, for extrapolation from AV{D,T,Q}Z results the error is twice as large

as that caused by not extrapolating at all. If AV{T,Q,5}Z basis sets are used, mean absolute

error drops to 0.015 eV, which is still an order of magnitude larger than for the A + B/l3

extrapolation, and only slightly better than not extrapolating at all. Finally, for AV{Q,5,6}Z

basis sets, the error is three times smaller than complete omission of extrapolation, but three

times larger than that of using any of the following formulas: A + B/l3 [56], A + B/lC [13],

or A + B/(l + 1/2)4 + C/(l + 1/2)6 [13]. All three of the latter yield a mean absolute

9

error of about 0.001 eV, on about the same order of accuracy as the reference values. For

the smallest basis set series AV{D,T,Q}Z, the mixed exponential-Gaussian extrapolation

[63] A + B/ exp(l − 1) + C/ exp((l − 1)2) represents a very substantial improvement over

A + B/C l, and actually exhibits the second-best performance (after A + B/l3). For the

AV{T,Q,5}Z series which is of greatest interest here, the Halkier et al. A + B/l3 formula by

far outperforms the other formulas considered.

In short, it appears to be established beyond doubt that the two-term formula of Helgaker

and coworkers [56] is the extrapolation method of choice, with the Martin three-term formula

A + B/lC the second-best choice provided basis sets of AV{T,Q,5}Z quality are used, and

the mixed exponential-Gaussian formula if only AV{D,T,Q}Z basis sets are used.

Computed spin-orbit contributions to the electron aﬃnities are compared in Table III

to values obtained from observed ﬁne structures [64,59,61]. While small deviations appear

to persist, these may at least in part be due to higher-order spin-orbit eﬀects which were

neglected in the calculation rather than to deﬁciencies in the electronic structure treatment.

At any rate, to the accuracy relevant for our purpose (establishing spin-orbit corrections

to molecular binding energies) it appears to be immaterial whether the computed or the

experimentally derived values are used.

Finally, the convergence of the SCF component is so rapid that it appears to be essentially

irrelevant which extrapolation formula is used — the amount bridged by the extrapolation

is on the order of 0.0001 eV.

IV. RESULTS FOR MOLECULES

Since application of electron correlation methods more elaborate than CCSD(T) would

be well-nigh impossible for molecules of practical size, we have restricted ourselves to

W[Q5;Q5;TQ5] and W[TQ5;TQ5;TQ5].

Inner-shell correlation contribution, as well as scalar relativistic corrections, were initially

computed with the largest basis sets practicable – in most cases ACV5Z or MTavqz (see Table

10

IV for details).

From a prerelease version of a re-evaluation of the experimental data in the G2/G3 set

at the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) [65], we have selected 28

ﬁrst-and second-row molecules which satisfy the following criteria: (a) the uncertainty in the

experimental total atomization energy TAE is on the order of 0.25 kcal/mol or better; (b) the

molecules are not known to exhibit severe multireference eﬀects; (c) anharmonic vibrational

zero-point energies are available from either experiment or high-level ab initio calculations

(see footnotes to Table IV for details).

Geometries were optimized at the CCSD(T)/VQZ+1 level, and to all second-row atoms

a complement of two tight d and one tight f function were added in every basis set to ensure

saturation in inner-shell polarization eﬀects.

In all cases, the exponents were derived as

even-tempered series αβn with β = 3.0 and α the highest exponent already present for that

angular momentum.

Computed (W[Q5;Q5;TQ5]) and observed results are compared in Table IV. The excellent

agreement between theory and experiment is immediately apparent:

in many cases, the

computed results fall within the already quite narrow experimental error bars. Over the

entire sample of molecules, the mean absolute error is 0.24 kcal/mol, with the largest errors

being about 0.6 kcal/mol (O2 and F2). Restricting our sample to ﬁrst-row molecules only,

we ﬁnd a mean absolute error of 0.24 kcal/mol, which however gets reduced to 0.17 kcal/mol

(maximum error 0.39 kcal/mol for N2) upon elimination of F2, NO, and O2 as having known

appreciable nondynamical correlation eﬀects. Over the subset of second-row molecules in

our sample MAE is 0.23 kcal/mol (maximum error 0.44 kcal/mol for H2S); upon elimination

of H2S and SO2 this is lowered to 0.20 kcal/mol.

It should be noted that these MAEs are comparable to those found by Martin and Taylor

[14] for a sample of ﬁrst-row molecules, yet unlike their study no correction for N-containing

bonds is required here.

The possibility that the errors in F2, NO, and O2 are actually due to residual basis set

11

incompleteness and/or that the excellent agreement with experiment for the other molecules

is actually due to an error compensation involving deﬁciencies in the predicted basis set

limit, was examined by carrying out W[56;56;Q56] calculations for H2O, F2, NO, O2, N2,

HF, and CO. As seen in Table V, the predicted basis set limits do not diﬀer materially from

their W[Q5;Q5;TQ5] counterparts, strongly suggesting that the latter expression in fact does

reach the basis set limit and that the residual errors are largely due to imperfections in the

CCSD(T) method.

While molecules liable to exhibit such errors are readily identiﬁable from inspection

of the largest coupled cluster amplitudes or evaluation of the T1 diagnostic [66], an even

simpler criterion is apparently oﬀered by the ratio TAE[SCF]/TAE[SCF+val.corr.]. In “well-

behaved” molecules such as CH4 and H2O, the SCF component makes up upwards of two-

thirds of the binding energy, while in NO and in O2 it makes up no more than a third and

a ﬁfth, respectively, of the total and F2 is actually metastable towards dissociation at the

SCF level. While for some molecules of this variety we actually obtain excellent results (e.g.

ClF), this may be due to error compensation or to the binding energies being fairly small to

begin with.

Further inspection of Table IV reveals that some of the ‘negligible’ contributions are in

fact quite signiﬁcant at the present precision level: for instance, Darwin and mass-velocity

contributions in SO2 amount to -0.71 kcal/mol (for SiF4 a somewhat extravagant -1.88

kcal/mol was found [8]), while atomic spin-orbit splitting in such compounds as Cl2, ClF,

and SO2 amounts to -1.68, -1.23, and -1.01 kcal/mol, respectively. Inner-shell correlation

contributions of 2.36 (C2H4), 2.44 (C2H2), 1.68 (OCS), and 1.76 (ClCN) kcal/mol speak for

themselves; interestingly (as noted previously [23,50]), these eﬀects on the whole do not seem

to be more important in second-row than in ﬁrst-row compounds.

Finally, we shall compare the performance of W[TQ5;TQ5;TQ5] and W[Q5;Q5;TQ5]

(Table VI). In general, the results with the three-point valence correlation extrapolation are

at best of the same quality as those with the two-point valence correlation extrapolation

12

and in many cases agree less well with experiment. We therefor will use the two-point

extrapolation exclusively henceforth.

V. W2 THEORY AND ITS PERFORMANCE

Having established that our ’base level of theory’ can obtain the right results for the right

reason, we shall now proceed to consider simpliﬁcations.

A. Inner-shell correlation

The use of the smaller MT basis set for the scalar relativistic contributions is found to

have an eﬀect of about 0.01 kcal/mol or less, with 0.02 kcal/mol being the largest individual

cases. This approximation can therefore safely be made.

Using the same MT basis set for the core correlation contribution on average aﬀects

energetics by 0.03 kcal/mol, the largest individual eﬀects being 0.07 kcal/mol for H2S, and

0.08 kcal/mol for OCS.

Even so, in fact, the core correlation calculations are quite CPU-time consuming, par-

ticularly for second-row compounds, due to the large number of electrons being correlated.

Any further reduction would obviously be welcome — it should be noted that the MT basis

set was developed not with eﬃciency, but with saturation (in the core-valence correlation

energy) in mind. Further experimentation revealed that the tightest p, d, and f functions

could safely be eliminated, but that further basis set reductions adversely aﬀect the qual-

ity of the core correlation contribution computed. The reduced basis set shall be denoted

as MTsmall, and in fact consists of a completely decontracted cc-pVTZ basis set with two

tight d and one tight f functions added. Since this basis set only has about half the basis

functions of the ACVQZ basis set per heavy atom, it represents a very signiﬁcant CPU time

savings (about 16 times) in a CCSD(T) calculation. The only molecule for which we see a

substantial diﬀerence with the MT basis set is SO2, for which Bauschlicher and Ricca [21]

13

previously noted that the inner-shell correlation contribution is unusually sensitive to the

basis set.

For the evaluation of the Darwin and mass-velocity corrections, diﬀerences with the larger

MT basis set are less than 0.01 kcal/mol across the board.

A further reduction in CPU time for the core correlation contribution would have been

achieved if MP2 or even CCSD calculations could be substituted for their CCSD(T) counter-

parts. However, as seen from Table VII, CCSD underestimates the CCSD(T) core correlation

contributions for several molecules by as much as 50%. The behavior of MP2 is quite similar

and the MP2–CCSD diﬀerences are substantially smaller than the (T) contribution, suggest-

ing that it is the treatment of connected higher excitations that is the issue. Predictably, the

largest (T) eﬀects on the core correlation contribution occur in molecules where connected

triple excitations are important for the valence binding energy as well, e.g. SO2, F2, Cl2,

N2. Conversely, in CH3 or CH4, which have quite small (T) contributions to the binding

energy, CCSD does perform excellently for the core correlation contribution. In PH3 and

H2S, on the other hand, substantial errors in the core correlation are seen even as the (T)

contribution to the valence correlation binding energy is quite small — it should be noted,

however, that both the absolute inner-shell correlation energy and the (T) contribution to it

are much more important in these second-row systems than in their ﬁrst-row counterparts.

One may rightly wonder whether the inner-shell contributions are in fact converged at

the CCSD(T) level. Unfortunately, if a more elaborate treatment is already impractical

for the valence correlation, this would a fortiori be true for the inner-shell correlation. We

did, however, carry out a CCSDT/MTsmall calculation on the N2 molecule, which we chose

as a representative case of failure of the CCSD approach for core correlation. The result-

ing CCSDT level core contribution, 0.87 kcal/mol, is only 0.05 kcal/mol larger than the

CCSD(T) value of 0.82 kcal/mol, to be compared with 0.42 kcal/mol at the MP2 and 0.52

kcal/mol at the CCSD level. It cannot be ruled out a priori that connected quadruple and

higher excitations might contribute to the inner-shell correlation energy. However, since

14

apparently their importance for the valence correlation binding energy is very small (other-

wise a treatment that completely ignores them would not yield the type of agreement with

experiment found in this work), it seems unlikely that they would greatly contribute to the

inner-shell correlation energy.

The “G3large” basis set used to evaluate, among other things, inner-shell correlation

eﬀects in G3 theory [3] is still smaller than the MTsmall basis set, and its performance

therefore is certainly of interest. Alas, in Table VII it is seen that in many cases it seriously

overestimates the inner-shell correlation energy, almost certainly because of basis set super-

position error which [21] is apparently more of an issue for inner-shell correlation energies

than for their valence counterparts. In G3 theory, the inner-shell correlation is evaluated at

the MP2 level: hence the two errors cancel to a substantial extent.

B. Zero-point energy

Not in all cases is a complete anharmonic force ﬁeld calculation feasible. We ﬁnd in Table

VIII that B3LYP/cc-pVTZ+1 harmonic zero-point energies scaled by 0.985 reproduce the

rigorous anharmonic zero-point energies quite nicely. (The scaling factor is about halfway

between what would be required for fundamentals, about 0.97, and harmonics, about 1.00.

[67,68])

C. Separate extrapolation of CCSD and (T)

The (T) contribution makes up a relatively small part of the valence correlation energy,

while its evaluation, in large basis sets and for systems with very many electrons, will domi-

nate the CPU time. For instance, in a very recent study on SiF4 [8], a CCSD(T) calculation

with an AVQZ basis set on F and a VQZ+2d1f basis set on Si took 50h7′ using MOLPRO

on an SGI Octane workstation (768 MB of memory being allocated to the job), of which

41h30′ were spent in the (T) step alone.

15

In addition, it was previously noted by Helgaker and coworkers [69] that the (T) con-

tribution appears to converge faster with the basis set than the CCSD correlation energy,

for which reason they actually propose its separate evaluation in a smaller basis set.

In

the present case, we have considered extrapolating it from AVTZ+2d1f and AVQZ+2d1f

results rather than AVQZ+2d1f and AV5Z+2d1f, respectively. In our adopted notation, this

becomes W[TQ;Q5;TQ5].

As seen in Table VI, the diﬀerence in quality between W[TQ;Q5;TQ5] and W[Q5;Q5;TQ5]

appears to be essentially negligible. This is an important conclusion, since it means that the

largest basis set calculation to be carried out is only at the CCSD level, at a fraction of the

cost of the full CCSD(T) counterpart — moreover it can be done using direct algorithms.

[70]

D. Protocol for W2 theory

The protocol obtained by introducing the succesful approximations given above will be

denoted here as W2 (Weizmann-2) theory. Its steps consist of the following:

• geometry optimization at the CCSD(T)/VQZ+1 level, i.e. CCSD(T)/VQZ if only

ﬁrst-row atoms are present;

• zero-point energy obtained from a CCSD(T)/VTZ+1 anharmonic force ﬁeld or, failing

that, B3LYP/VTZ+1 frequencies scaled by 0.985 (vide infra);

• Carry out CCSD(T)/AVTZ+2d1f and CCSD(T)/AVQZ+2d1f single-point calcula-

tions;

• Carry out a CCSD/AV5Z+2d1f single-point calculation;

• the SCF component of TAE is extrapolated by A + B/C l from SCF/AVTZ+2d1f,

SCF/AVQZ+2d1f, and SCF/AV5Z+2d1f results (l=3, 4, and 5, respectively);

16

• the CCSD valence correlation component is obtained from applying A + B/l3 to

CCSD/AVQZ+2d1f; and CCSD/AV5Z+2d1f valence correlation energies (l=4 and 5,

respectively). It is immaterial whether this is done on total energies or on components

to TAE;

• the (T) valence correlation component is obtained from applying A + B/l3 results to

CCSD(T)/AVTZ+2d1f and CCSD(T)/AVQZ+2d1f values for the (T) contribution. It

is again immaterial whether this is done on total energies or on components to TAE;

• core correlation computed at CCSD(T)/MTsmall level

• scalar relativistic corrections (and,

if necessary, spin-orbit splittings) computed at

ACPF/MT level. To save CPU time, this can be combined into a single job with

the previous step.

On a typical workstation at the time of writing (e.g. an SGI Octane with 1 GB of RAM and

2×18 GB external disks) its applicability range would be about three heavy atoms in C2v

symmetry, although the main limiting factor would be disk space and larger systems could

be treated if a direct CCSD code were available.

We will illustrate the CPU time savings made in the W2 approach, compared to our

most rigorous calculations, using two examples: a ﬁrst-row diatomic (CO) and a second-

row molecule (OCS). Using MOLPRO on an SGI Octane workstation, the most accurate

calculations reported in this work (Table IV) required 21h36′ for CO and no less than 362h12′

for OCS. W2 theory yields essentially identical results at a cost of 1h12′ (CO) or 13h42′ (OCS)

— a reduction by a factor of 20–30 which is typical of the other molecules.

VI. W1 THEORY AND ITS PERFORMANCE

In an eﬀort to obtain a method that is applicable to larger systems, we introduce a few

further approximations. Relevant results can be found in Table VI.

17

A. Use of density functional reference geometries

B3LYP/cc-pVTZ+1 geometries are close enough to their CCSD(T)/VQZ+1 counterparts

that their use does not cause a major eﬀect on the ﬁnal computed result. There is one notable

exception to this rule for the molecules considered here: Cl2, for which the B3LYP/VTZ+1

bond distance of 2.0130 ˚A is quite diﬀerent from its CCSD(T)/VQZ+1 counterpart, 1.9972

˚A. (The experimental value [71] is 1.9879 ˚A.) While B3LYP and B3PW91 on the whole tend

to produce essentially identical geometries and harmonic frequencies [68], it has been argued

previously [72] that the B3PW91 functional may be somewhat more reliable for systems with

high electron density; and in fact, the B3PW91/VTZ+1 bond distance of 1.9912 ˚A is much

closer to the CCSD(T)/VQZ+1 and experimental value.

Even so, the use of a B3LYP/VTZ+1 reference geometry still does not aﬀect the com-

puted De by more than 0.14 kcal/mol. We conclude that CCSD(T) geometry optimizations,

which will become fairly costly for larger molecules, can safely be replaced by B3LYP calcu-

lations, which can also serve for obtaining zero-point energies.

B. Further reduction of basis set sizes

The obvious ﬁrst suggestion would be to also carry out the CCSD extrapolation using

smaller basis sets, i.e. W[TQ,TQ,DTQ].

The eﬀect for the SCF component of TAE is very small on condition that the extrapo-

lation is carried out not on the individual total energies but rather on the computed SCF

components of TAE themselves. Clearly error compensation occurs between the molecule

and the constituent atoms.

The eﬀect on the valence correlation component, unfortunately, is rather more signiﬁcant.

Over the ‘training set’, MAE rises to 0.37 kcal/mol even after SO2 (which clearly is a patho-

logical case here) has been eliminated. Aside from the latter, eliminating systems with mild

nondynamical correlation does not lead to any signiﬁcant reduction in MAE. Also noteworthy

18

is that, on average, the binding energies appear to be somewhat overestimated: this is easily

explained from the fact that basis sets like AVTZ+2d1f are not quite saturated in the radial

correlation energy either, and that therefore the TAE[AVQZ+2d1f]−TAE[AVTZ+2d1f] gap

will be an overestimate of the TAE[L=4]−TAE[L=3] gap.

C. Use of empirical extrapolation exponents

Truhlar [73] considered the use of L-extrapolation formulas with empirical exponents,

carried out from cc-pVDZ and cc-pVTZ calculations, as an inexpensive alternative to very

large basis set calculations.

We will investigate here a variant of this suggestion adapted to the present framework.

The valence correlation component to TAE will indeed be extrapolated using the formula

A + B/lβ, in which β is now an empirical parameter — we will denote this W[Q5;Q5;TQ5]β

and the like.

We then add in all the further corrections (core correlation, scalar relativistics, spin-orbit)

that occur in W2 theory, and try to determine β by minimizing MAE with respect to the

experimental TAE values for our ‘training set’. Not surprisingly, for W[Q5;Q5;TQ5]β this

yields an optimum exponent (β=2.98) which diﬀers insigniﬁcantly from the ‘ideal’ value of

3.0. Alternatively, β could be optimized for the best possible overlap with the W[56;56;Q56]

results: in fact, the same conclusion is obtained, namely that making β an empirical param-

eter does not improve the quality of the results.

For W[TQ;TQ;DTQ] however, the situation is rather diﬀerent. The optimum exponent β

is found to be 3.18 if optimized against the experimental TAE values, and 3.16 (insigniﬁcantly

diﬀerent) if optimized against the W[Q5;Q5;TQ5] results. In both cases, MAE drops to 0.30

kcal/mol, and on average no more overestimation occurs.

W[TQ;TQ;DTQ]3.18 represents a signiﬁcant savings over W2 theory.

Its time-

determining step in molecules with many electrons will be the evaluation of the parenthetical

triples in the AVQZ+2d1f basis set — their elimination would be most desirable.

19

A natural suggestion would then be W[DT;TQ;DTQ]β. Optimization of β against the

experimental TAE values yields β=3.26; the not greatly diﬀerent β=3.22 is obtained by

minimization of the deviation from W[Q5;Q5;TQ5] results for the training set. Since the

latter does not explicitly depend on experimental results and therefore minor changes in the

computational protocol do not require recalculation for the entire ‘training set’, we will opt

for the latter alternative.

In either case, we obtain MAE=0.30 kcal/mol — for a calculation that requires not more

than an AVTZ+2d1f basis set for the largest CCSD(T) calculation, and an AVQZ+2d1f basis

set for the largest CCSD calculation. Again, the latter is amenable to a direct algorithm.

D. Protocol for W1 theory

We thus propose the following protocol for a computational level which we will call W1

(Weizmann-1) theory:

• geometry optimization at the B3LYP/VTZ+1 level (B3LYP/VTZ if only ﬁrst-row

atoms are present). Alternatively, the B3PW91 exchange-correlation functional may

be preferable for some systems like Cl2 — under normal circumstances, B3LYP/VTZ+1

and B3PW91/VTZ+1 should yield virtually identical geometries;

• zero-point energy obtained from B3LYP/VTZ+1 (or B3PW91/VTZ+1) harmonic fre-

quencies scaled by 0.985;

• Carry out CCSD(T)/AVDZ+2d and CCSD(T)/AVTZ+2d1f single-point calculations;

• Carry out a CCSD/AVQZ+2d1f single-point calculation;

• the SCF component of TAE is extrapolated by A + B/C l from SCF/AVDZ+2d,

SCF/AVTZ+2d1f, and SCF/AVQZ+2d1f components of TAE (l=2, 3, and 4, respec-

tively)

• set β=3.22

20

• the CCSD valence correlation component is obtained from applying A + B/lβ to

CCSD/AVTZ+2d1f and CCSD/AVQZ+2d1f valence correlation energies (l=3 and 4,

respectively). In both this and the next step, it is immaterial whether the extrapolation

is carried out on components to the total energy or to TAE;

• the (T) valence correlation component is obtained from applying A + B/lβ results to

CCSD(T)/AVDZ+2d and CCSD(T)/AVTZ+2d1f values for the (T) contribution.

• core correlation contributions are obtained at the CCSD(T)/MTsmall level;

• scalar relativistic and, where necessary, spin-orbit coupling eﬀects are treated at the

ACPF/MTsmall level. As in W2 theory, this latter step can be combined in a single

job with the previous step.

W1 theory can be applied to fairly large systems (see below). CPU times are dominated

by the inner-shell correlation contribution (particularly for second-row compounds), which

is reﬂected in the relatively small time reduction compared to W2 theory — e.g., from 1h12′

to 24′ for CO and from 13h42′ to 8h48′ for OCS. In addition — contrary to W2 theory —

W1 theory exhibits a pronounced diﬀerence in performance between ﬁrst-row and second-

row compounds: for the species in Table VI, MAE is 0.26 kcal/mol for ﬁrst-row, but 0.40

kcal/mol for second-row compounds. Since the CPU time gap between W1 and W2 theory

is fairly narrow for second-row species, we conclude that for accurate work on second-row

species — unless precluded by disk space or memory limitations — it may well be worth

to ‘walk the extra mile’ and carry out a W2 rather than a W1 calculation. For ﬁrst-row

systems, on the contrary, W1 may well seem the more attractive of the two.

VII. SAMPLE APPLICATIONS TO LARGER SYSTEMS

By way of illustration, we have carried out some W1 theory calculations on trans-1,3-

butadiene and benzene. All relevant computed and observed results are summarized in

21

Table VIII. The example of benzene is representative and will be discussed here in detail —

it should be mentioned that the calculation was carried out in its entirety on an SGI Octane

workstation with 2x18 GB external SCSI disks.

The reference geometry was obtained at the B3LYP/cc-pVTZ level [74]. The zero-point

energy at that level, after scaling by 0.985, is found to be 62.04 kcal/mol.

The SCF component of TAE is predicted to be 1044.95 kcal/mol at the one-particle basis

set limit, of which only 0.39 kcal/mol is covered by the geometric extrapolation. Of the

CCSD valence correlation component of 291.07 kcal/mol, however, some 10.11 kcal/mol is

covered by the extrapolation, which also accounts for 2.13 kcal/mol out of the 26.55 kcal/mol

connected triple excitations contribution.

The inner-shell correlation contribution is quite sizable at 7.09 kcal/mol, although this

number is not qualitatively diﬀerent from that for three acetylenes or three ethylenes. Finally,

Darwin and mass-velocity terms contribute a small but signiﬁcant -0.96 kcal/mol, and atomic

spin-orbit splitting another -0.51 kcal/mol. All adds up to 1367.95 kcal/mol at the bottom of

the well, or 1305.92 kcal/mol at 0 K, which is in excellent agreement with the experimental

value of 1306.1±0.12 kcal/mol from the NIST WebBook [75].

The CCSD/VQZ calculation took 10h10’ with MOLPRO on the Octane,

the

CCSD(T)/VTZ calculation 1h48’ on a single CPU on the Origin 2000. By far the most time-

consuming part of the calculation was the inner-shell correlation contribution, at 67h46’, to

which another 4h52’ should be added for the Darwin and mass-velocity contribution. We

see similar trends in the results for trans-butadiene, which agree with experiment to virtu-

ally within the stated experimental uncertainty; for allene, we obtain a value intermediate

between the two experimental values proposed in the WebBook.

We ﬁnd for both molecules that the sum of core-correlation and relativistic contributions

can be quite well estimated by additivity approximations. For instance, the core correlation

and scalar relativistic contributions with the same basis set for C2H4 are +2.360 and -0.330

kcal/mol, respectively, adding up to 2.030 kcal/mol. Assuming 2 and 3 times this ‘C=C

22

bond equivalent’ for butadiene and benzene, respectively, yields estimated contributions

of 4.06 (trans-butadiene), and 6.09 (benzene) kcal/mol, which agree excellently with the

directly computed values of 4.02 and 6.12 kcal/mol, respectively. Considering that inner-

shell correlation eﬀects should be fairly local in character, such schemes should work quite

well for larger organic systems where the valence calculation would still be feasible but the

explicit inner-shell calculation would not be.

VIII. CONCLUSIONS

We have developed and presented two quasi-‘black box’ schemes for high-accuracy cal-

culation of molecular atomization energies or, equivalently, molecular heats of formation, of

ﬁrst-and second-row compounds.

The less expensive scheme, W1 (Weizmann-1) theory, yields a mean absolute error of

0.30 kcal/mol and includes only a single, molecule-independent, empirical parameter.

It

requires no larger-scale calculations than CCSD/AVQZ+2d1f and CCSD(T)/AVTZ+2d1f

(or, for nonpolar ﬁrst-row compounds, CCSD/VQZ and CCSD(T)/VTZ). On workstation

computers and using conventional coupled cluster algorithms, systems as large as benzene

can be treated, while larger systems are feasible using direct coupled cluster methods.

The more expensive scheme, W2 (Weizmann-2) theory, contains no empirical parameters

at all and yields a mean absolute error of 0.23 kcal/mol, which is lowered to 0.18 kcal/mol

for molecules dominated by dynamical correlation. On workstation computers, molecules

with up to three heavy atoms can be treated using conventional coupled cluster algorithms,

while larger systems can still be treated using a direct CCSD code.

The inclusion of scalar relativistic (Darwin and mass-velocity) corrections is essential for

good results in second-row compounds, particularly highly polar ones. Inclusion of inner-

shell correlation contributions is absolutely essential: the basis set denoted as MTsmall

(for Martin-Taylor small) appears to represent the best compromise between quality and

computational expense. We do not recommend the use of lower-level electron correlation

23

methods than CCSD(T) for the evaluation of the inner-shell contribution.

Among the several inﬁnite-basis set extrapolation formulas for the correlation energy

examined, the three-parameter A + B/(l + 1/2)α expression proposed by Martin [13] and

the A + B/l3 expression proposed by Helgaker and coworkers [56] yield the best results for

suﬃciently large basis sets, with the latter formula to be preferred on grounds of stability of

the extrapolated results with the basis sets used. Geometric and mixed geometric-Gaussian

extrapolation formulas [55,63] are unsatisfactory when applied to the correlation energy,

although they appear to be appropriate for the SCF component.

The main limiting factor for the quality of our calculations at this stage appears to be

imperfections in the CCSD(T) method. This assertion is supported by the fact that the mean

absolute error in the computed electron aﬃnities of the atoms H, B–F and Al–Cl drops from

0.009 eV to 0.0009 eV if CCSDT and full CI corrections are included.

Extrapolation of the (T) contribution to the correlation energy can, at no loss in accuracy,

be carried out using smaller basis sets than the CCSD contribution.

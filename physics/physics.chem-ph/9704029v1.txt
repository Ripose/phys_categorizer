ABSTRACT

The de Broglie-Bohm ontological interpretation of quantum theory[1, 2]

clariﬁes the understanding of many otherwise counter-intuitive quantum

mechanical phenomena. We report here on an application of Bohm’s

quantum potential to the bonding and reactivity of small molecules. In

the ﬁeld of quantum chemistry, Bader has shown[3] that the topology of

the Laplacian of the electronic charge density characterizes many features
of molecular structure and reactivity. Examination of high accuracy ab-
initio solutions for several small molecules suggests that the Laplacian of

Bader and the quantum potential of Bohm are structurally equivalent.

It is possible that Bohmian mechanics using the quantum potential can

make quantum chemistry as clear as it makes non-relativistic quantum

mechanics.

A set of ab-initio computational experiments were performed simulating H2O,

2ρ localizes lone pairs, bonded charge concentrations and
2ρ acts as an objective

Bader has shown[3] that

when analyzing a wavefunction by decomposition into a particular orbital basis.

In order to explore the application of the de Broglie–Bohm interpretation of

∇

∇

quantum mechanics[1, 2] to molecular physics, we also calculated the Bohm quantum

potential Q for the same molecules. Visual comparison of the three dimensional

structure of these two ﬁelds (Q and

2ρ) strongly suggests they are equivalent.

Density functional theory calculations were carried out for the optimized ground

state equilibrium geometries of water, hydrogen peroxide, and ethylene using Gaus-
sian 94[8] at the b3lyp/6-311++g(2d,2p) level of theory[9]. Isosurfaces of the Lapla-
2ρ = C, were visualized[10] for these molecules

cian of the electronic charge density,

over a range of values of C and are shown in ﬁgures 1-4 for the case of water[11].

Following the analysis of Bader[3], regions of

charge concentration, and conversely regions of

2ρ < 0 correspond to electronic

2ρ > 0 correspond to regions of

charge depletion. The four views of H2O shown in Figure 1 correspond to a very
2ρ. The electronic charge concentrations associated with the

negative value of

nuclei as well as the two lone pair charge concentrations on the oxygen atom are

visible. For a less negative value of the Laplacian (ﬁgure 2), concentrations of
2ρ = 0 (ﬁgure 3) the

outline of the entire molecule emerges. Finally, for a positive value of

electronic charge on the OH bonds become visible. At

three regions of valence charge depletion are visible, as well as the region of depletion

surrounding the Oxygen’s core electrons.

The structure of

and saddle points in

2ρ may be formally deﬁned in terms of the attractors, repellors,
2ρ and their interconnections[3]. In the case of water, there

is one attractor at each nucleus, one in each lone pair region, one on each bond, and

no others (ﬁgures 1-3).

To compute Bohm’s quantum potential[1] we ﬁrst express the wavefunction in
polar form, Ψ = ReiS/¯h. The quantum potential for an N electron molecule using

the Born-Oppenheimer approximation is then:

Q is a function of the 3N coordinates of all of the electrons, and

Q is, in Bohm’s in-

terpretation of quantum mechanics, the nonlocal quantum force that acts in addition

to the classical forces on each electron.

For a one-electron molecule, Q reduces to

Visualization in three-dimensional physical space of the 3N dimensional quantum

potential for multiple electron molecules was accomplished by calculating Q as

a function of Ψ1 = qρ/N where Ψ1 is the solution of the exact one-electron
Schr¨odinger equation for an N-electron molecule[12].
In this case, Q is identical

to Q1 times a constant. In terms of the charge density (ρ) and the Bader Laplacian

Isosurfaces of the (one electron) Bohm quantum potential for H2O are shown in

ﬁgures 5-8 for a range of values. The topology of this ﬁeld (the structure of its foli-

ation by isosurfaces, or, equivalently, the attractor, repellor, and saddle connections
2ρ in the case of water, as well as in

of its gradient) appears identical to that of

the cases of all other molecules examined by the authors.

There are some geometrical diﬀerences between the two ﬁelds. The presence of
the factor ρ−1/2 in the expression for Q implies that the magnitude of Q may be large

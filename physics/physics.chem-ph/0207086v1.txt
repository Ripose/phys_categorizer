To gain some insight into the structure and physical signiﬁcance of the multiple solutions to the
coupled-cluster doubles (CCD) equations corresponding to the Pariser-Parr-Pople (PPP) model of
cyclic polyenes, complete solutions to the CCD equations for the A−
1g states of benzene are obtained
by means of the homotopy method. By varying the value of the resonance integral β from −5.0 eV to
−0.5 eV, we cover the so-called weakly, moderately, and strongly correlated regimes of the model. For
each value of β 230 CCD solutions are obtained. It turned out, however, that only for a few solutions
a correspondence with some physical states can be established. It has also been demonstrated that,
unlike for the standard methods of solving CCD equations, some of the multiple solutions to the
CCD equations can be attained by means of the iterative process based on Pulay’s direct inversion
in the iterative subspace (DIIS) approach.

I. INTRODUCTION

The understanding of the electronic correlation eﬀects
in cyclic polyenes (or [M ]annulenes, with the chemical
formula CM HM , where M = 4m0 + 2, m0 = 1, 2, . . .) has
attracted considerable interest for many years. To some
extent this interest has been caused by the fact that these
molecules provide models for extended one-dimensional
metallic-like systems which epitomize the diﬃculties en-
countered in the description of extended many-electron
systems. A very useful tool in these studies proved to
be the coupled cluster (CC) method.1 Even its simplest
variant, the CC method with double excitations (CCD),1
is able to reproduce most of the electronic-correlation ef-
fects. More sophisticated CCSD2 and CCSD(T)3 meth-
ods provide often quite accurate approximations to the
full conﬁguration-interaction (FCI) results (which deﬁne
the limit for a given orbital basis set). The CC method
furnishes a set of coupled nonlinear inhomogeneous equa-
tions, of unknowns representing the amplitudes of the CC
operator ˆT (the t amplitudes), in which the number of
equations is equal to the number of unknowns. However,
due to their nonlinearity, the CC equations have multi-
ple solutions; this problem was ﬁrst analyzed by ˇZivkovi´c
and Monkhorst.4,5 It is still little known about the math-
ematical properties of these solutions.

Recently,6–9 for the ﬁrst time, some insight into the
structure of the complete set of solutions to the CC
equations has been gained by applying the powerful
homotopy (continuation) method10,11 to the CCD and
the CCSD equations corresponding to some four-electron
four-orbital systems, known as the H4 and P4 models.12
These studies included the correspondence between CC
and conﬁguration interaction (CI) methods,7 and the in-
ﬂuence of the approximate form of the cluster operator
on the structure of solutions of the associated equations.8
Within the symmetry and spin-adapted CCD formalism,

the CCD equations for the H4 model comprise a system
of six coupled quadratic inhomogeneous equations for six
unknowns (the t2 amplitudes of the double-excitation
operator ˆT2). According to the B´ezout theorem, the
maximum number of solutions amounts in this case to
26 = 64. Yet Kowalski and Jankowski6 showed that the
CCD equations for the H4 model case have only 12 solu-
tions (6 real, and 3 pairs of complex solutions). Some
of these solutions corresponded to the variational re-
sults of the conﬁguration-interaction with doubles (CID)
method.

In the present paper we study, by means of the homo-
topy method, multiple solutions of the CCD equations for
the six-electron six-orbital system corresponding to the
Pariser-Parr-Pople (PPP)13–15 model of benzene. This
system is of special interest for theoretical chemists: the
sextet of π-electrons is responsible for the peculiar chem-
ical properties of benzene which is the archetypal aro-
matic molecule. The PPP model is known to provide a
simpliﬁed yet reliable picture of many-electron systems.16
For benzene, one gets an almost perfect description of the
π-electron part of the excitation spectrum by optimizing
the empirical parameters of the PPP model at the FCI
level.17,18 Moreover, in the PPP model the strength of
the electronic-correlation eﬀects can be controlled with-
out changing the molecular geometry, by simply adjust-
ing the value of the so-called resonance integral β (< 0).
Very high symmetry of the PPP benzene model ensures
that the number of symmetry-independent parameters
entering the exact (FCI) or an approximate (e.g., CCD)
wave function is small. All that makes the PPP benzene
model particularly suitable for testing quantum-chemical
methods dealing with the electronic correlations.

Benzene is the ﬁrst member of the [M ]annulene fam-
ily for which, as mentioned above, the understanding of
the electronic structure is of rather general signiﬁcance.
These systems, especially when described within the PPP

1

model, seem deceptively simple: their one-electron states
are fully determined by the spatial symmetry, and so
is their Hartree-Fock (HF) determinantal wave function.
Yet [M ]annulenes turn out to be a challenge to the exist-
ing computational methods of treating the electronic cor-
relations: it has been found that for larger [M ]annulenes
(corresponding to m0 > 2), in the so-called strong corre-
lation regime of β, the CCD method breaks down com-
pletely, as no real solution of the CCD equations exists
for β greater than some critical value.19,20 A recent CC
study of [M ]annulenes, taking into account the double
(D), triple (T), and quadruple (Q) excitations in the CC
operator, showed that even the CCDTQ method breaks
down for these systems when the correlation eﬀects be-
come suﬃciently strong.21 For the PPP benzene model,
a real CCD solution representing the ground state can
be found for any β
0. However, as β approaches 0,
the CCD t2 amplitudes deviate more and more from the
corresponding FCI values, thus suggesting that some cor-
relation eﬀects peculiar to the higher [M ]annulenes may
surface already in the strongly correlated regime of the
PPP benzene model. This provides an additional moti-
vation for the present study.

II. PPP MODEL OF BENZENE

A detailed description of the PPP model of annulenes
may be found in Ref. 21. In benzene the C atoms form a
regular hexagon, and the C–C bonds are assumed to be
of the length R0 = 1.4 ˚A. The PPP model invokes the π-
electron approximation and describes the six π electrons
of benzene by using a minimal basis set of 2pz atomic
orbitals associated with the six carbon atoms. The set
of these π atomic orbitals (πAOs) is then subject to the
symmetrical orthonormalization procedure of L¨owdin,22
yielding the set of six orthonormalized π atomic orbitals
2, 3 (we use here
(πOAOs), denoted by χm , m = 0,
the numbering system employed in Ref. 21). The Fock-
space Hamiltonian ˆH for benzene, built according to the
prescriptions of the PPP model, is given in Eq. (2) of
Ref. 21. The following semiempirical parameters are used
in the PPP model:
(i) α, the so-called Coulomb integral for the carbon atom,
representing the binding energy of electron described by
the πOAO χm (for simplicity we put α = 0 eV),
(ii) β(< 0), the resonance integral, corresponding to the
electron transfer between the neighboring πOAOs, χm
3.0,
and χm+1 (our results are for β =

The point-symmetry group of benzene is D6h, but its
subgroup C6 is suﬃcient for the symmetry considerations
in the π-electron approximation. The molecular orbitals
of the π symmetry (πMOs), expressed as linear combina-
tions of πOAOs, are completely determined by the pro-
jections onto the irreducible representations of the C6
group and read as

III. CCD METHOD FOR THE PPP MODEL OF
BENZENE

In the standard single-reference CC theory,

the
ground-state FCI wave function Ψ for a six-electron sys-
tem is represented as

Ψ = exp( ˆT )Φ ,

(5)

· · ·

where ˆT = ˆT1 + ˆT2 +
+ ˆT6 is the CC operator and Φ is
the RHF determinantal wave function, playing the role
of the reference conﬁguration. The ˆTn components of the
CC operator correspond to the connected n-tuple exci-
tations from occupied to unoccupied spin-orbitals. Each
ˆTn operator depends on some linear parameters, here-
after referred to as the tn amplitudes; the ordered set
of all tn amplitudes form a vector denoted by tn.
In
the CC theory one introduces a similarity-transformed

ten in an explicit form, the CC equations (7) form a set
of coupled inhomogeneous nonlinear equations, with the
number of unknowns (the tn amplitudes) equal to the
number of equations. On a basis of the FCI method, it
can be shown that the exact tn amplitudes are real. In
the simplest approximate variant of the CC method, the
CCD one, one puts ˆT = ˆT2 and neglects t1, t3, and t4
amplitudes in Eqs. (6) and (7b) (as well as the remaining
CC equations). The CCD equations (7b) then become
a set of coupled inhomogeneous quadratic equations for
the unknown t2 amplitudes, and from Eq. (6) an approx-
imate correlation energy, ECCD

corr , is calculated.

In the PPP model of benzene the occupied and un-
occupied orbitals belong to diﬀerent representations of
the C6 group, which causes ˆT1 and ˆT5 to vanish by sym-
metry. Because t1 = 0, the RHF function Φ becomes
equal to the Brueckner determinantal function.24 In this
case Eqs. (7a) are automatically satisﬁed, and the CCD
method becomes equivalent to the CCSD one. When the
nonorthogonal spin adaptation of the CCD equations is
performed (see, e.g., Ref. 25), the spin-adapted t2 ampli-
tudes for benzene may be written as t(k1, k2, q), where k1
and k2 are occupied-πMOs labels, and q (
0) is chosen
such that k1 + q and k2 + q are unoccupied-πMOs labels
(see Ref. 21). It can be shown that there are 11 diﬀer-
ent sets of k1, k2, and q, thus deﬁning 11 t2 amplitudes
for benzene. By assuming that these amplitudes are real
and employing the time-reversal symmetry, one ﬁnds a
symmetry constraint21

which reduces the number of the symmetry-independent

In Ref. 21 we employed the general non-orthogonally
spin-adapted CCD equations for the PPP model of the
[M ]annulenes, with the t2 amplitudes t(k1, k2, q) subject
to the symmetry constraint (8). For benzene, the set of
these equations may be written as

through the dependence on β of the orbital energies (2).
There is still some symmetry hidden in the set of CCD
equations (9): due to the so-called alternancy symmetry
of the PPP Hamiltonian ˆH (see Ref. 26, and references
therein) one ﬁnds that

x2 = t(0, 0, 2) = t(1,

1, 2) = x3 ,

(13)

−

(for the general formula for [M]annulenes, see Ref. 21).
This property propagates into Eq. (9) making them in-
variant with respect to the interchange of indices 2 and
3. However, our set of CCD equations is not explic-
itly adapted to the alternancy symmetry, and solutions
breaking this symmetry are, in principle, possible.

The usual method of solving the CCD equations is
based on an iterative procedure, which in the case of
Eq. (9) may be written as follows:

nishes t2 amplitudes that substituted into Eq. (10) give
the second-order Møller-Plesset (MP2) correlation en-
ergy. When convergent, this simple iterative procedure
provides a single solution to the CCD equations (9). Such
a solution is bound to be real and to preserve the alter-
nancy symmetry, which corresponds to the fulﬁllment of
Eq. (13). In our calculations for the PPP model of ben-
zene with β
5.0 eV,0 eV], we found that the above
described simple iterative procedure is indeed conver-
gent, and the correlation energy calculated by substitut-
ing the convergent t2 amplitudes into Eq. (10) approxi-
mates the FCI value for the ground state. The agreement
between the CCD and FCI results (t2 amplitudes and
Ecorr) is very good in the weakly and moderately corre-
2.5 eV,
lated regimes (β in the vicinity of
respectively), but becomes rather poor in the strongly
0.5 eV). The CCD and FCI re-
correlated regime (β >

IV. MULTIPLE SOLUTIONS OF CCD
EQUATIONS FOR BENZENE

The CCD equations (9) comprise a set of 8 cou-
pled quadratic inhomogeneous equations (with real co-
eﬃcients) for 8 unknowns. According to the B´ezout the-
orem, such equations may have up to 28 = 256 solutions,
complex in general. In principle, a complete set of solu-
tions can be found by means of the homotopy (continua-
tion) method.10,11 Below we present the results obtained
by applying the homotopy method to the CCD equations
(9) corresponding to various values of the resonance inte-
gral β: from
5.0 eV (representing the weakly correlated
−
regime) to
0.5 eV (representing the strongly correlated
−
regime). The FCI results used for comparison were cal-
culated with gamess.27

Equations (9) have been derived by taking into account
the spin and the time reversal symmetries, as well as the
reality of the t2 amplitudes, see Eq. (8). However, these
equations may have also complex solutions. Such solu-
tions have to appear in pairs: if x = (x1, x2, . . . , x8) is a
complex solution, then its complex-conjugate x∗ is also a
solution. For a complex solution, the correlation energy
calculated from Eq. (10) assumes (in general) a complex
value, and the complex-conjugate solutions correspond to
the complex-conjugate values of the correlation energy.
Pairs of complex solutions, x and x∗, will be called de-
generate, since they correspond to the same real part of
the complex correlation energy calculated from Eq. (10).
Some solutions may also violate the equality (13) derived
from the alternancy-symmetry. Such symmetry-broken
solutions, for which x2 6
= x3, also have to appear in
pairs: if x is such a solution, then x′, in which the val-
ues x2 and x3 are interchanged, has to be a solution as
well. Pairs of the real symmetry-broken solutions, x and

x′, are also degenerate. In the case of the general com-
plex symmetry-broken solutions, x and x∗, x′ and x′∗
form a degenerate quadruplet. We have found, however,
a special class of complex symmetry-broken solutions in
which the only complex values correspond to x2 = x∗
3.
In such a case one has x∗ = x′, and the pair of solu-
tions x and x′ corresponds to the same real value of the
correlation energy calculated from Eq. (10). Thus, the
solutions of Eqs. (9) may be classiﬁed into ﬁve distinct
categories: real symmetric (which are non-degenerate),
real symmetry-broken, complex symmetric, general com-
plex symmetry-broken, and a special class of complex
symmetry-broken with the real energy.

In Table II the number of CCD solutions belonging
to diﬀerent categories is presented for several values of
the resonance integral β. The total number of solutions
(230) is surprisingly large: it is only slightly smaller than
the B´ezout upper bound (256), and much larger than
the number of solutions for the H4 model (6 real and
6 complex, compared to the upper limit 64 allowed by
the B´ezout theorem6). The number of CCD solutions is
also much larger than the number of the FCI solutions
for the PPP model of benzene, having the same symme-
try as the RHF wavefunction Φ, see further discussion.
This implies that most of the CCD solutions have no
physical meaning. Since the FCI method is equivalent
to the full coupled-cluster (FCC) method, it is interest-
ing that the CCD equations, which have smaller order
and a smaller number of the unknowns, have more solu-
tions than the more sophisticated FCC equations. This
suggests that the truncated CC equations are unable to
utilize all the symmetries that are present in the many-
electron Hamiltonian. For the H4 model it was observed8
that the number of solutions increased from CCD (12 so-
lutions) to CCSD (60 solutions), and then decreased to
7 for FCC.

While for the H4 model the number of pairs of complex
solutions was equal to the number of real solutions, for
the PPP model of benzene there are much more complex
than real solutions. Since all the FCI results are real,
the complexity of the solutions must be caused by the
truncation of the CC operator. Since all the linear coef-
ﬁcients in the CCD equations (9) are real, each complex
solution must have its complex conjugate counterpart.
However, while solving these equations by using the ho-
motopy method, we have found in several instances that
some complex-conjugate solutions were missing (dupli-
cated solutions were also encountered). Since the prob-
lem has not been previously reported, we think that it
may have arisen due to the numerical complexity of the
problem (a lot of roots to be traced in the homotopy al-
gorithm). It brings in the question whether the CCD so-
lutions presented here are complete. After removing du-
plicates and adding solutions that must be present due to
symmetry, we have found that the total number of states
is constant (equal to 230) for each considered value of β.
The number of solutions preserving the alternancy sym-
metry has also appeared to be constant (equal to 124).

It seems therefore unlikely that certain states has been
overlooked.

Due to the alternancy symmetry of the PPP model,
the six-electron symmetry states of benzene split into
two categories, denoted by “minus” and “plus.”28 Includ-
ing the spin symmetry and the spatial symmetry of the
D6h group, the ground-state RHF wave function Φ cor-
−
responds to the symmetry label A
1g. Among 400 FCI
states of benzene generated by gamess27 there are only
−
18 states corresponding to the A
1g symmetry. These

mA
orthogonal to Φ, and thus may be expressed in the form
of the CC expansion (5). For each case, the correspond-
ing tn amplitudes may be extracted from the FCI linear
coeﬃcients: there are 7 t2 amplitudes, 2 t3 amplitudes,
7 t4 amplitudes, and only a single t6 amplitude (only
non-redundant parameters are counted).

where we use the real part of the amplitudes tCCD
. Here θ
measures the angle between the vectors, and η—the ratio
of the vector lengths; in the above analysis we use the vec-
tors corresponding to the full set of t2 amplitudes (of the
dimension 11), i.e., containing the symmetry-redundant
amplitudes fulﬁlling Eq. (8). In principle, a complex so-
lution may be considered an approximation to some real
solution of the FCI equations as long as the imaginary
parts of the t2 amplitudes are small in comparison to the
real parts.

Some of the CCD solutions, obtained for several val-
ues of β, are characterized in Table III. Solution numbers
nCCD are assigned in accordance with the increase (of the
real part) of the corresponding correlation energy value
calculated from Eq. (10). For instance, nCCD = 005 de-
notes the 5th solution. Due to the large number of solu-
tions, we consider only those that are the closest to some

FCI ones, i.e. those corresponding to θ and η closest to 0

be obtained from the authors).

Since the standard method of obtaining CCD solutions
is via iterative procedure (14), it may be useful to study
the the performance of this procedure in attaining multi-
ple solutions when starting from various CCD solutions
obtained by the homotopy method. Obviously, if the so-
lutions were exact, the iterations would stop after the
ﬁrst iteration. However, the small errors in the numeri-
cal values would lead to a non-trivial iteration sequence.
The question is whether this sequence is convergent and,
if yes, what is the converged result. We tested all the
real solutions and it is surprising that the series is either
divergent or the result is identical to the ground state.
It means that only the ground state is stable in the iter-
ative process. It explains why the iterative process with
the MP2 starting point gives only the ground state solu-
tion.

A diﬀerent behavior has been found when applying
the direct inversion in the iterative subspace (DIIS)
method29,30.
It turned out that this method, which is

useful for accelerating convergence, improves also the sta-
bility of the iterative process. Most of the states are sta-
ble in the DIIS iterative process and only between 6–8
states out of the 22–32 real ones either diverge or con-
verge to a diﬀerent state (not necessarily to the ground
state). It is worth stressing that the “underground” so-
lutions are iteratively unstable for all the cases tested.

V. CONCLUDING REMARKS

In this paper we have investigated the complete set of
solutions of the CCD equations corresponding to the PPP
model of benzene. This is the largest system for which
the complete set of solutions has been obtained. We have
found that the number of solutions (for a broad range of
the resonance integral β) is surprisingly large (equal to
230), approaching the limit given by the B´ezout theorem

(equal to 256). One may wonder if some peculiar prop-
erties of the PPP model are responsible for that prolif-
eration of solutions. To this end, we have checked the
behavior of the PPP model of butadiene, which is anal-
ogous to the H4 model studied previously by Jankowski
and Kowalski.7,8 We have found, however, that the CCD
equations for these two models have roughly the same
number of solutions. We thus conclude that the large
number of solutions of the CCD equations correspond-
ing to the PPP model of benzene have to be related to
some special properties of a cyclic π-electron system. The
number of solutions is expected to grow exponentially for
the larger cyclic polyenes (annulenes). The known diﬃ-
culties with solving the CC equations for these systems
(see Ref. 21 and references therein) are undoubtedly a
consequence of this multiple-solution problem. On the
other hand, some non-standard solutions of the CCD
equations for larger annulenes may turn out to be similar

6

to certain excited-state FCI solutions of these systems.
Since attaining these solutions by means of the homotopy
method seems to be out of reach in the near future, we
ﬁnd it encouraging that the DIIS method29,30 of carry-
ing the iterations in the CC method proved quite eﬀective
in assessing the stability of several multiple solutions to
the CCD equations for benzene. This has inspired us to
look for multiple solutions of the CCD equations for the
next member of the annulene family, cyclodecapentaene
(C10H10). Indeed, several new solutions were found by
combining a sort of random generation of the initial t2
amplitudes with the DIIS iterations. The results of these
investigations will soon be published.

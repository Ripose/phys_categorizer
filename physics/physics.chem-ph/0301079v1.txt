We study, both theoretically and experimentally, the dynamical response of Turing patterns to
a spatio-temporal forcing in the form of a travelling wave modulation of a control parameter. We
show that from strictly spatial resonance, it is possible to induce new, generic dynamical behaviors,
including temporally-modulated travelling waves and localized travelling soliton-like solutions. The
latter make contact with the soliton solutions of P. Coullet Phys. Rev. Lett. 56, 724 (1986)
and provide a general framework which includes them. The stability diagram for the diﬀerent
propagating modes in the Lengyel-Epstein model is determined numerically. Direct observations
of the predicted solutions in experiments carried out with light modulations in the photosensitive
CDIMA reaction are also reported.

The study of pattern dynamics under external forc-
ing provides a powerful tool to deeply probe their inher-
ently nonlinear mechanisms under non-equilibrium con-
ditions. A great deal of attention has been focused on
resonances or locking of spatially structured states, ei-
ther stationary or oscillatory, under temporal (spatially
uniform) [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] or spatial (steady) modulations
[6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. Steady patterns in reaction-diﬀusion sys-
tems typically arise from the celebrated Turing mech-
anism [11, 12]. According to it, inhomogeneous distri-
butions of chemical concentrations self-organize sponta-
neously out of a non-structured medium as a result of
a competition between autocatalytic reaction steps and
the diﬀerential diﬀusivities of an activator (smaller) and
an inhibitor-like (larger diﬀusion) species. Turing pat-
terns are endowed with an intrinsic wavelength, depend-
ing only on the kinetic and diﬀusion parameters, but lack
an intrinsic frequency, in contrast to oscillatory chemi-
cal systems [12]. Genuine Turing patterns were ﬁrst ob-
served in quasi two-dimensional gel reactors (pre-loaded
with appropriate chemical indicators) in the CIMA [13]
and the CDIMA [14] reactions, and appear as patterned
distributions of iodide. The CDIMA reaction has the
interesting feature of being photosensitive [15].

It seems thus timely to search for generic behavior in
the unexplored perspective of spatio-temporal forcing of
pattern forming systems. Speciﬁcally, we aim at studying
the dynamical response of photosensitive Turing patterns
to the simplest external spatio-temporal forcing consist-
ing of a travelling-wave modulation of the control param-
eter associated to the illumination. Through the mecha-
nism of pure spatial resonance an external frequency will
thus be imposed in an otherwise nonoscillatory system.
As a consequence, new nontrivial dynamical modes are
expected to arise which allow to connect the two trivial
limiting cases, namely: a travelling pattern locked to the
forcing at low velocities and a standing pattern resulting

from the time-averaging of the forcing at large velocities.
Analytical and numerical results will be reported featur-
ing the simplest of these spatio-temporal behaviors. Ex-
periments conducted with the CDIMA reaction are also
provided which fully conﬁrm our theoretical predictions.
Beyond the particular chemical context that motivates
our study, such solutions, and the conditions of their ap-
pearance, are suﬃciently generic to be applicable to a
rather general class of pattern forming systems including
for instance Rayleigh-B´enard convection. In a sense, our
study may be viewed as a development of the work of
Coullet [7, 16] on commensurate-incommensurate transi-
tions in nonequilibrium (spatially) forced systems.

The experimental system under study is modelled
within the Lengyel-Epstein scheme [14], once modiﬁed
to include the eﬀect of illumination, as [15]:

Here u and v are the dimensionless concentrations of two
of the chemical species; a, c, σ, and d denote dimension-
less parameters of the chemical system. The eﬀect of
external illumination is introduced through the φ-terms.
This contribution can be decomposed into the mean value
φ0 and a modulation part: φ(x, t) = φ0 +ǫ cos(kf x+ωt).
For purely homogeneous illumination, ǫ = 0, the equa-
tions admit a solution which in the following will be
referred to as base state: u0 = (a
5φ0)/(5c), v0 =
a(1 + u2

0)/(5u0).

All our numerical results are obtained through inte-
gration of the model reaction-diﬀusion equations (1),(2)
with periodic boundary conditions by means of a pseudo-
spectral method with a linear-implicit time-stepping.
From here on we ﬁx the parameters to the following:
a = 16, c = 0.6, d = 1.07, and σ = 301. These values

were chosen to reproduce the experimental conditions re-
ferred to below. The large σ value, corresponding to a
strong diﬀusion contrast between the two species, guar-
antees that we are far from the oscillatory regime of this
chemical system. Consequently, only the Turing bifurca-
tion will play a role. The remaining parameters concern
the forcing term. One of them, φ0, will serve as the pa-
rameter to locate the position of the Turing bifurcation
in the homogeneous problem. For the given parameters it

We begin our analysis with the case of exact 1:1 spatial
resonance kc = kf . Choosing the length L of the periodic
domain to be 10λ, where λ = 2π/kc is the critical wave-
length at instability, we ﬁx L = 58.72 and the amplitude
ǫ = 0.1.

≈

As is known from the analysis of time-independent
forcing, the spatial 1:1 resonance yields an imperfect bi-
furcation to Turing patterns [7]. Accordingly, the base
state ceases to be a stationary solution and is modiﬁed
into a non-homogeneous state for every value of the bifur-
cation parameter φ0. For φ0 in the stable region (above
2.3) this state is a travelling wave (TW). The TW locks
to the forcing wave, adopting the same wave-number and
frequency, with only a constant phase diﬀerence. This is
the trivial state to be expected for slow driving. For large
ω the amplitude of the TW approaches 0. The TW’s ex-
ist to the right of the solid curve in ﬁg. 1.

Crossing the solid curve in ﬁg. 1 the TW state un-
dergoes a ﬁrst instability into a state with temporally
modulated amplitude (MTW, triangles in ﬁg. 1). This
is the signature of a Hopf bifurcation which introduces a
new frequency fH (see ﬁg. 2a). Note that the modulation
of the amplitude occurs uniformly in the entire system.
We found that for large ω the Hopf frequency converges
to the frequency ω of the forcing wave.

The solutions and the transition described above can
be rationalized in terms of an amplitude equation. Fol-

Using polar coordinates, A = R exp iΘ, we look for

µ, the dimensionless distance to threshold. Its amplitude
approaches 0 with increasing ω in accordance with our
observations for the Lengyel-Epstein model. Θ0 is the
phase shift between the forcing wave and the resulting
pattern.

We now address the more generic case of inexact 1:1
resonance [19], introducing a slight wavenumber misﬁt,
kf
= kc. To allow for a continuous variation of the mis-
ﬁt in a ﬁnite system, we will ﬁx the integer wavenum-
ber (n = kL/2π) of the forcing to n = 10 and change
smoothly the length L of the periodic domain. For ex-
ample, for L = 65 the 10th wave number corresponds
to kf
0.97. Fig. 3 depicts the complex behavior that
was found changing kf from 0.9 to 1.26 (L = 70, . . . , 50).
The average illumination φ0 was ﬁxed to 2.25 during all
of the simulations. For the purely homogeneous forcing
(i.e. φ′ = 0) this value corresponds to a slightly unstable
base state.

In ﬁg. 3 the stability domain in ω and kf is given for
four diﬀerent states. The TW state, the solution locked
to the forcing, is the only stable solution for approxi-
mately ω
1. Above a roughly horizontal transition
curve close to ω = 1.1 the TW states are unstable. For
kf = kc and close to this point the transition occurs at
ω

1.15 (cf. ﬁg. 1) and results in the MTW.

≈
The domain of stability of the MTW is given by the
solid curve in ﬁg. 3. Outside of this domain the attractors
are either the TW state or one of two diﬀerent new lo-
calized states which we call soliton waves (SOW)[20]. A
typical space-time plot is shown in ﬁg. 2b. Spatial plots
of these states show that they resemble the soliton-like
solutions for the case of non-travelling forcing [7] but they
exhibit the following new properties: the soliton, i.e., the
localized suppression of the amplitude moves relatively to
the underlying travelling pattern with a relative velocity
which may be positive or negative. Furthermore, as the
soliton travels along the pattern the phase of the back-
ground pattern moves in either direction. In our case the
integer wavenumber of the background pattern is either
n = 9 or n = 11 and the corresponding states are repre-
sented in ﬁg. 3 with circles and diamonds, respectively.

Beyond the range of forcing wavenumbers shown in
ﬁg. 3 there exist further soliton states in accordance with
the prediction for non-travelling forcing [7]. Here we will
describe only the two states that are adjacent to the
MTW state in ﬁg. 3. The states represented by dia-
monds (resp. circles) carry a soliton that moves to the

6
6
right (resp. left). The approximate range of stability for
these states is given by the dashed curve (resp. dotted
curve).

Note that the stability domains of the soliton states
and the MTW state overlap. Remarkably, at suﬃciently
large ω the soliton states are even stable for kf = kc, i.e.,
exact 1:1 resonance. This contrasts to the case of static
forcing [7] where only the presence of a misﬁt can lead to
solitons.

The above localized states (SOW) can be described
as quasi-periodic in the sense that their behavior can be
reproduced as superposition of two modes, namely, the
forcing (travelling) mode with wavelength L/10 and an
adjacent mode with wavelength L/9 or L/11, typically
the closer one to the characteristic wavelength of the Tur-
ing instability. The excited Turing mode is standing so
that the superposition of both yields a localized envelope
(soliton) moving to the right (L/11) or to the left (L/9).
Furthermore, one ﬁnds the velocity of the soliton to be
proportional to the quotient of ω and the diﬀerence of
the wavenumbers of the two modes, which agrees with
numerical results of the full problem.

Note that the phase diagram depicted in ﬁg. 3 ex-
hibits large regions of multistability, with the correspond-
ing hysteresis.
It is worth remarking that the stabil-
ity boundaries here reported may well be aﬀected by to
ﬁnite-size eﬀects, since possible long wave-length, phase
instabilities may be prevented by the ﬁnite size of our
simulations. A full envelope and phase-diﬀusion descrip-
tion of this scenario in an inﬁnite system deserves a de-
tailed study and will be addressed elsewhere.

A link between the SOW’s and the solitons for steady
forcing is apparent for smaller ǫ. We decreased the value
of ǫ to 0.003 and determined the domain of stability for
the soliton 11 state for ω values close to 0 (ﬁg. 4). It ap-
pears that even for vanishing ω the soliton states persist
and the domain of stability forms a “tongue” with a ﬁnite
range at ω = 0. For larger ǫ and ω = 0 the SOW’s do not
exist since the driving term dominates the equations and
forces a homogeneous pattern. Therefore it seems that
the relative suppression of the forcing term by a eﬀec-
tive time-averaging due to a fast travelling forcing may
account for the existence of soliton states for larger ǫ.

To prove the feasibility of controlled spatio-temporal
forcing and to check the validity and robustness of our
predictions in a real system undergoing a Turing insta-
bility, we have carried out experiments on the (photosen-
sitive) CDIMA chemical reaction, using the projection of
travelling light patterns as the controlled forcing. Exper-
iments were performed in a thermostatized continuously
fed unstirred one-feeding-chamber reactor at 4
0.5 C.
Structures appear in an agarose gel layer (2% agarose,
thickness 0.3 mm, diameter 20 mm). The gel layer was
separated from the feeding chamber by an Anapore mem-
brane (Whatman, pore size 0.2 mm) and a nitrocellulose
membrane (Schleicher & Schnell, pore size 0.45 mm).

Under the chosen set of reagent concentrations (see cap-
tion of ﬁg.5), the system at dark spontaneously yields
disordered stripe patterns with a wavelength of 0.54 mm.
In a typical experiment, parallel light stripes with a char-
acteristic wavelength of precisely 0.54 mm were focused
on the gel layer and were moved in the horizontal direc-
tion with well-controlled and constant velocity v. For
very small values, trivial travelling stripes, following adi-
abatically the imposed pattern, were found, as expected.
As the passing velocity was increased they readily trans-
formed into the modulated striped mode, as predicted by
the theory (see ﬁg. 5a). Furthermore, when considering
a slight misﬁt (see caption of ﬁg.5), a localized structure
was observed, propagating in the opposite direction to
that of the stripes (see ﬁg. 5b).This again constitutes a
neat conﬁrmation of our theoretical ﬁndings. Further ex-
periments are presently being conducted to look for other
modes of dynamical responses to such a spatio- temporal
modulation and will be published elsewhere.

We have described a generic mechanism to induce new
pattern dynamics through spatial resonance. The phe-
nomenon is claimed to be generic for systems undergo-
ing a Turing instability. For instance we have already
observed the same type of response in the 1d Swift-
Hohenberg equation. Within the framework of chemical
Turing patterns, the consideration of the 2d case is read-
ily accessible and points out to even richer phenomena.

[18] Further analysis shows that this instability is related to
the loss of a stable ﬁxed-point solution in the homoge-
neous phase diﬀusion equation (5).

[19] We have also observed the transition from TW to MTW

at 2:1 resonance.

[20] The term ’soliton’ is abused here in the sense of localized
modulation, but the referred states are not necessarily
solitons in a strict sense.

hol with a residence time in the reactor of 250 s. With these
parameters the system spontaneously yields stripe patterns
with a wavelength of 0.54 mm. (Experimental parameters: v
= 0.13 mm/h for both cases, the imposed wavelength is 1.1
times the spontaneous one in the case of the soliton solution
case).

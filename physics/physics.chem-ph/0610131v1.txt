Coherent Control techniques are computationally applied to cold (1 mK < T < 1 K) and ultracold
∗
(3s,3P2) + Ar(1S0) collisions. We show that by using various initial superpositions
(T < 1 µK) Ne
∗
(3s,3P2) M = {−2, −1, 0, 1, 2} Zeeman sub-levels it is possible to reduce the Penning
of the Ne
Ionization (PI) and Associative Ionization (AI) cross sections by as much as four orders of magnitude.
It is also possible to drastically change the ratio of these two processes. The results are based on
combining, within the “Rotating Atom Approximation”, empirical and ab-initio ionization-widths.

PACS numbers:

Cold and ultracold atomic processes present a new lab-
oratory environment in which to explore and utilize the
quantum nature of matter. In this letter we show that
the signiﬁcance of quantum eﬀects in such systems per-
mit unprecedented control over collisional processes. In
particular, we consider the theory and computational im-
plementation of the coherent control[1, 2, 3, 4] of absolute
and relative cross sections in the collision of metastable
atoms A∗ and ground state target atoms B. Such colli-
sions can result in two main channels: (1) the ionization
of the target atom and the de-excitation of the metastable
species, i.e., Penning Ionization (PI) [5], or (2) Asso-
ciative Ionization (AI), wherein the colliding partners
form an ionic dimer while emitting an energetic electron.

As an example, we consider the coherent control of PI
and AI resulting from collisions between Ne∗(3s,3P2) and
Ar(1S0) in the cold and ultracold regimes. Amongst
other observations, the suppression of these processes
in favor of elastic scattering may well prove useful for
the production of Bose-Einstein Condensates of excited
states atoms.

A wealth of experimental information and theoretical
calculations on the uncontrolled Ne∗ + Ar collisions is
available and the possibility of control of this system at
thermal energies[6] now exists. As we report below, the
control achievable in the sub mK regime is far more im-
pressive.

The Initial Superposition State: Coherent Control is
achieved by preparing the colliding pair in an initial su-
perposition of internal states, such as,

|ψi = eiK·RCM+ik·r

|φAri

aM |φM

Ne∗ i ,

(2)

XM

where |ψAri is the initial state of the Ar atom and |φM

Ne∗ i,

are Ne∗ Zeeman sublevels, with M = {−2, −1, 0, 1, 2}
being the projection of the Ne∗ electronic angular mo-
mentum on the space-ﬁxed quantization axis. aM are
preparation coeﬃcients, to be optimized to yield a de-
sired objective, RCM is the CM coordinate, RCM ≡
/(mNe + mAr) , and r is the inter-
mNerNe + mArrAr
nuclear separation vector, r ≡ rNe − rAr . The (Body-
(cid:0)
Fixed) momenta are given as, K ≡ kNe + kAr , k ≡
mArkNe − mNekAr
/(mNe + mAr) . Here rAr and kAr
(rNe and kNe) denote the position and momentum of the
(cid:0)
Ar (Ne∗) atom in the laboratory frame. Note that the
fact that the initial superposition state is comprised of
degenerate M states, and that the collision partners are
atoms, ensures that the conditions for coherent control[3]
are satisﬁed.

The rates of the PI and AI processes mainly depend
on λ, the body-ﬁxed (BF) projection of the electronic an-
gular momentum on r, the interatomic axis. It is there-
fore necessary to express the |φM
Ne∗i states in terms of
the |φλ
Ne∗i BF states. We adopt the “Rotating Atom
Approximation”[7] according to which the axis of quan-
tization of the electrons faithfully follows the internuclear
separation vector. This establishes a 1:1 correspondence
between the M values and the λ values as the atoms
approach one another. Hence, the (even parity) linear
combination in the BF frame is written as,

|ψi = |φArieiK·RCM+ik·r

|φΩ

Ne∗ iaΩ,

XΩ=0

where Ω ≡ |λ|, and (due to the assumed even parity)
aΩ ≡ (aM + a−M ).

Scattering Theory: The basic formulae for our pur-
poses are found in Refs.
[8, 9, 10] giving the scattering
amplitudes for PI and AI based on O’Malley’s theory of
dissociative attachment [11, 12]. Prior to the collision
the internuclear momentum vector k has magnitude k
and direction ˆk. After the collision its magnitude is kf

and its direction is ˆkf . Asymptotically the Penning elec-
tron departs along the ˆkε direction with energy ε. The
energy of the emitted electron is related to the collisional
energy E and the energy of the nuclei after the collision
E′ by the conservation of energy E + ε0 = ε + E′, with
ε0 = E∗ − IE being the diﬀerence between the excitation
energy of the metastable Ne∗ atom and the ionization
energy of the target Ar atom.

The scattering amplitude, which is exact within the
Born-Oppenheimer approximation, is given by [8, 9, 13]

2 Γ(r) and ψε(r) describes the system on the

(r), which is the probability amplitude for
cluded in Vε,ˆkε

Partial wave expansions of ψε(r), Vε,ˆε(r), and ψd(r),

where q indicates the exit channel. There are three possi-
ble exit channels characterized by the electronic state of
the products: X 2Σ+
2Σ1/2. The en-
trance channel optical potential are connected with each
of the exit channels using Morgner’s Γ splitting [18, 19].
We use optical potentials for the entrance channel de-
rived directly from experiment[14, 15]. Since data is
available only for scattering experiments at thermal en-
ergies (above 1 K), the optical potentials do not include
eﬀects associated with very slowly moving atoms (e.g.,
hyperﬁne interactions).

ionization cross section we sum over all the exit channels,
and integrate over the solid angles ˆkε and ˆkf , and over
the emitted electron energy ε. It is easy to see from the
form of the scattering amplitude that the integration over
the solid angles yields a Kronecker delta function, thus
simplifying the expressions for the f ∗

As a ﬁrst example we examine coherent control ob-

Note the crucial interference term, dependent on the
magnitude and phase of the ai, which allows control over

Computational Results: Although results are reported
for collisions at temperatures up to 1 K, our main fo-
cus is on cold collisions at a temperature of 1 mK and on
ultracold collisions at 1 µK. At the low temperatures con-
sidered, the PI or AI cross sections are very large since
the two atoms are in the vicinity of one another for an
extended period of time. Further, in the ultracold case
only the s partial wave contributes, with three angular
momentum states contributing in the cold case.

For these energies the relative velocities between the
collisional pair are ≈ 1 m/s and ≈ 0.006 m/s respectively.
These relative velocities are experimentally attainable us-
ing laser cooling and manipulation techniques. For exam-
ple, the atoms can be cooled and trapped in a 3D optical
lattice, then adiabatically accelerated along a single axis
[20]. This setup can reach velocities of up to a few meters
per second, and a kinetic energy spread of 150-200 nK
around the central beam velocity. The present collisional
scenario would require two 3D lattice setups in order to
control both scattering particles. The internal state su-
perposition can be prepared[21] after cooling while the
atoms are trapped in the lattice, for this two techniques
are possible: stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STI-
RAP) [22] or coherent population trapping (CPT) [23].
Consider ﬁrst control results across a broad spectrum
of energies up to temperatures of 1 K, Figure 1 shows
the cross sections for Ω = 0 and Ω = 1 scattering as a
function of energy. Also shown are the maximum and
minimum controlled cross sections (optimized over the
ai coeﬃcients) at each energy for the Ω = 0 plus Ω = 1
linear combination. Several resonances[24] are evident,
since the collision energy is very close to the dissociation
threshold for the Ne∗-Ar quasimolecule. Noteworthy is
that control is extensive, with enhancement and suppres-
sion of both cross sections being possible at both resonant
and nonresonant energies.

Table I presents numerical results for the cold collision
(1 mK) case. We see that it is possible to actively change
the AI and PI cross sections by as much as four orders of
magnitude for the Ω = 0, 1 linear combination and three
orders of magnitude for the Ω = 0, 2 linear combination.
For both linear combinations the position of the minima
and maxima for σPI and σAI occur at close points in the
parameter space (not shown here). A similar observation
has been noted in the thermal case (above 1 K), indicat-
ing that both PI and AI cross sections can be controlled
simultaneously [6]. Sample results for the control of σPI

3

as a function of ai for the cold collision case are shown
in Fig. 2a.

Ultracold collisions, where only s waves contribute to
the process, show even more dramatic behavior. As seen
in Table II, active changes of up to four orders of mag-
nitude, using the Ω = 0, 1 superposition states, and up
to three orders of magnitude, using the Ω = 0, 2 super-
position states, are possible. The AI process can also
be almost as well controlled. The resulting σAI cross
sections are shown in Fig. 2b for ultracold collisions as
function of the ai. Note that in all cases, the maxima
and minima in the control plots (Figs. 1 and 2) are well
separated, making the experiment less sensitive to the
control parameters.

In summary, we have shown the possibility of a huge
range of control of the PI and AI cross sections in Ne∗+Ar
cold and ultracold collisions. Control is achieved by ini-
tiating the collision in a judiciously chosen superposi-
tion of Ne∗ quantum states. Such states can be read-
ily made using new STIRAP techniques[21]. Our results
show a wide range of controllability for both PI and AI.
For PI the minimum of the cross section is found to be
orders of magnitude smaller than the incoherent mixture
of Ω = 0, 1 or Ω = 0, 2. In the AI reaction the eﬀects are
even more dramatic, showing a minimum four orders of
magnitude smaller than that of the incoherent mixture
Ω = 0, 1 and three orders of magnitude smaller than the
Ω = 0, 2 mixture.

We realize a novel high ﬂux source of cold atoms and molecules employing hydrodynamic en-
hancement of an eﬀusive aperture at cryogenic temperatures. Molecular oxygen from the source is
−1. The
coupled to a magnetic guide, delivering a cold, continuous, guided ﬂux of 3 × 1012 O2 s
dynamics of the source are studied by creating and spectroscopically analyzing high-ﬂux beams of
atomic ytterbium.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The study of cold gas-phase molecules is a major thrust
of modern chemical and atomic physics[1].
In partic-
ular, inelastic collisions of cold molecules have recently
attracted widespread theoretical and experimental in-
terest. These collisions are a window into the internal
structure and dynamics of molecular interactions as well
as being the expected fundamental limiting process for
collisional cooling of molecules into and through the ul-
tracold regime [2]. In addition to collision studies, cold
molecules are sought as ideal test objects for precise mea-
surement of fundamental constants (including the search
for an electron EDM[3, 4]) and as bits for quantum
computing[5, 6]. All of these areas of research beneﬁt
from high ﬂux sources of cold molecules and this has
spurred widespread interest in realizing such sources.

Although cold atomic sources have been laboratory
standards for over a decade, only recently have simi-
lar sources of molecules been demonstrated. This is
largely because the complex level structure of molecules
makes laser cooling – the workhorse of atom cooling –
extremely diﬃcult. Demonstrated techniques to pro-
duce cold, low velocity samples of molecules are buﬀer-
gas cooling[7], billiard-like collisions[8], ﬁltering slow
molecules from an eﬀusive source [9, 10], deceleration
of molecules from a seeded supersonic source in time-
varying electric ﬁelds[1, 11], photoassociation of cold and
ultracold atoms [12], and the formation of molecules from
ultracold atoms using Feshbach resonances [13]. In gen-
eral, the ﬂuxes achieved with these molecular sources
have been far lower than those achieved in cold atom
sources.

We earlier[14] reported a molecular and atomic beam
source based on buﬀer gas cooling, showing that cryo-
genic cooling of ablated atoms and molecules could eﬀec-
tively produce cold, near-eﬀusive beams. By employing a
cold cell (≈ 4 K) ﬁlled with helium gas and several solid
ablation targets (e.g. PbO), pulsed beams were produced
with temperature and forward velocity equivalent to 5 K.

∗Electronic address: doyle@physics.harvard.edu

This was realized by producing gas phase molecules with
short-pulse laser ablation inside the cell. A millimeter
size oriﬁce in the side of the cell allowed a small fraction
of the cold molecules to escape into a cryogenic high-
vacuum region, forming a beam. The ratio of the number
of molecules cooled in the cell to the number emitted into
the beam was determined by the ratio of the oriﬁce area
to the total area of the interior of the cell, about 10−3. It
was estimated that beams of molecules from this source
coupled to a magnetic or electric guide would produce a
peak guided ﬂux no higher than 109 molecules s−1.

In this letter we realize a cold molecule buﬀer-gas
source that uses hydrodynamic eﬀects to vastly enhance
the molecular beam ﬂux compared to the old source.
Oxygen is used as our test molecule. We show that this
new source can successfully load a magnetic guide, pro-
ducing a guided beam of cold O2 with a continuous ﬂux
of 3 × 1012 molecules s−1 into a room-temperature high-
vacuum region. This is 1000 times greater than that pre-
dicted with the old source. This ﬂux compares favorably
to cold atom sources and far exceeds previous demon-
strated ﬂuxes of cold molecules. Using atomic ytterbium
we further characterize the creation and dynamics of the
beam before it enters the guide. We develop a simple
model of hydrodynamic enhancement within the cell and
ﬁnd reasonable agreement between this model and our
data. The performance of this guide/source combination
is well described by Monte-Carlo simulation.

II. BEAM APPARATUS

The heart of our experimental apparatus is a ≈ 2.5 cm
size cell anchored to the cold plate of a cryostat. This
cell is a copper box with two ﬁll lines (one for helium and
one for oxygen) on one side, an aperture on the opposite
side, a Yb ablation target inside, and windows for laser
access. In these experiments we create beams of either
atomic Yb or O2. To produce beams of O2 we ﬂow He
and O2 continuously into the cell where they mix and
thermalize to the temperature of the cell. The He does
not freeze to the walls of the cell but any O2 molecule that
touches the wall does. The O2 cools by thermalizing with
the helium. The helium and a fraction of the O2 escape

out through an double-stage aperture (see section III A),
forming a beam, with the balance of the O2 remaining
frozen on the cell walls. The same general processes of
thermalization and beam creation occur with Yb. To
produce beams of Yb we ﬂow He continuously into the
cell and ablate the Yb target with a pulsed laser (4 nsec,
532 nm, 10 mJ).

In more detail, the copper cell is 2.5 × 2.5 × 2.5 cm
(V ≈ 15 cm3) and its temperature is varied between T =
2.6 K - 25 K. It is surrounded by (dewar) vacuum, heat
shields and optical windows (see Fig. 1a). Cooling of
the cell is done with a pulsed tube refrigerator and a
small pumped liquid helium reservoir (used to achieve
temperatures below 4 K). The copper He gas ﬁll line to
the cell is thermally anchored to a 1.3 K cold plate a few
centimeters before it enters the cell. The O2 ﬁll line is
held at 100 K, above the freezing point of oxygen. A short
stainless steel sleeve thermally disconnects the relatively
warm O2 line from the cell. Helium is typically ﬂowed
into the cell at 1 × 1017- 8 × 1018 atom s−1 and O2 is
ﬂowed into the cell at similar rates, typically 1 × 1017-
3 × 1018 molecules s−1.

Despite the large He gas ﬂow, the beam region vacuum
is maintained at a low 3 × 10−8 torr by two stages of dif-
ferential pumping with high speed cryopumps made of
activated charcoal (T = 6.5K, 2000 cm2 total apparent
area). A 30 cm long magnetic guide (see Fig. 1d) can be
placed with the guide entrance 1 cm from the aperture.
The guide is constructed from an array of permanent Nd-
FeB magnets (each magnet 0.3 cm × 0.6 cm × 7.5 cm).
The magnets are arranged in a linear octopole, such that
low ﬁeld seeking molecules are conﬁned to the center of
the guide. The far end of the guide (the “guide exit”)
is not at cryogenic temperatures, but rather deposits the
guided molecules into a room temperature residual gas
analyzer (RGA). The guide has an inner diameter of 0.9
cm and 5000 G depth, equivalent to 680 mK for O2 in
its most magnetic guidable state. The guide undergoes
a single bend with radius of curvature r = 20 cm. This
bend ensures that only guided molecules can pass; i.e.
O2 must be moving slower than 7000 cm s−1 (9 K equiv-
alent temperature) to be guided around the bend. The
entire system imposes a heat load of ≈ 1 watt on the 4
K refrigerator.

III. RESULTS

We run two diﬀerent types of experiments, guided
(with O2) and unguided (with Yb). In the guided work,
we beam O2 into a magnetic guide and measure with the
RGA the ﬂux of O2 exiting the guide. The RGA is cal-
ibrated by comparison to a NIST-traceable standard O2
leak. In the unguided work, we remove the guide assem-
bly and use Yb to characterize the beam source. The
ﬂux and velocity proﬁle of the Yb beam and the density
and temperature of Yb gas in the cell are all measured
using laser absorbtion spectroscopy.

2

We chose to guide O2 because it is relatively easy to
introduce into our cold cell and has a high magnetic mo-
ment of 2 Bohr magneton. Because the O2 is cooled
in zero magnetic ﬁeld, it is expected that the molecules
occupy a uniform statistical mixture of Zeeman states.
Thus, ≈ 1/9 of the molecules exiting the aperture are
in the maximally guided N = 1,J = 2,mJ = 2 state,
where N is the rotational quantum number, J is the to-
tal angular momentum quantum number, and mJ is its
projection on the axis deﬁned by the magnetic ﬁeld. We
estimate that the contribution to guided beam ﬂux from
other states is small (< 10%).

The molecule source and guide were characterized by
varying the O2 ﬂow, He ﬂow, and cell temperature, while
always monitoring the output ﬂux of O2. Fig. 2 shows
our guided ﬂux for a range of temperatures. Because the
depth of the guide (680 mK) is less than the tempera-
ture of the source over the entire range of temperatures
used, a colder source will lead to a higher ﬂux of guided
molecules. This is seen in the data. A Monte-Carlo simu-
lation of our guide is plotted with the data. Agreement is
excellent, showing not only that we are guiding molecules
but that the details of the system are well understood.
Our maximum measured guided ﬂux of 3×1012 O2 s−1
is achieved by simultaneously ﬂowing 10 sccm of O2 and
2 sccm of He into the cell (sccm is standard atmosphere-
cc per minute). The system can operate at this peak
ﬂux for about 100 seconds before the aperture becomes
plugged with oxygen ice.

We note that we are conﬁdent that the O2 in our guide
is cold rotationally as well as translationally. In all our
previous work with buﬀer gas cooling and in many super-
sonic beam experiments it has been observed that rota-
tional thermalization rates are comparable or faster than
elastic scattering rates[7, 15].

A. Cell and Aperture Dynamics

The high guided ﬂuxes of O2 we achieve is due to a
newly utilized eﬀect in our beam source, hydrodynamic
enhancement. We ﬁrst describe a simple theory of this
eﬀect and then describe experiments with Yb that verify
this basic picture.

The helium gas in our cell can be characterized by
mean free path ℓ (typically, ℓ ≈ 0.1 cm). Atoms and
molecules can leave the cell via two processes: by diﬀus-
ing to the cell wall (with a small fraction of the molecules
diﬀusing out of the aperture) or by being entrained in
the helium ﬂow that is continuously leaving through the
aperture. If the diﬀusion time for an atom or molecule
(τdif f usion) is much shorter than the characteristic time
a helium atom (or entrained species) spends in the cell
(τpumpout), hydrodynamic eﬀects can be ignored. In this
diﬀusive limit the fraction that escape into the beam from
a cell of side length L with aperture area A is f ≈ πL2/A
(about about 2×10−3 for our cell). If, on the other hand,
τdif f usion ≫ τpumpout, a large fraction are entrained in-

a) Hot (≈ 100K) O2 molecules or ablated Yb atoms thermalize with helium gas in a cold (3-25K) copper cell. The mixture then
sprays through the slit aperture and enters a beam guide. Cold, low ﬁeld seeking molecules are guided into an RGA detector.
b)“One-stage aperture” detail. This aperture was characterized with laser-ablated atomic Yb. The mean free path in the
main cell (left) is generally short enough to thermalize hot Yb atoms before they touch and stick to the wall of the cell. The
slit aperture allows this mixture to form a beam in the dewar vacuum. Hydrodynamic entrainment greatly enhances the ﬂow
through this aperture compared to a simple eﬀusive source. This conﬁguration produced high ﬂux atomic Yb beams with
signiﬁcant forward velocity (see Fig. 3 and discussion on page 4).
c)“Two-stage aperture” detail. This two-stage aperture is implemented with the idea to produce a high ﬂux eﬀusive source. As
in b), a mixture of He and O2 ﬁrst exits from the cell through a slit aperture. However, in this case, rather than enter the beam
directly, the mixture enters a small second cell. Additional venting holes on the side of the second cell maintain a low enough
pressure that ﬂow through the ﬁnal aperture is largely eﬀusive. The He density in the second chamber is much lower than in
the ﬁrst cell, so O2 molecules experience just a few more collisions before being diﬀusing through the ﬁnal aperture. These
collisions are suﬃcient to rethermalize the molecules that have been hydrodynamically boosted due to their passage through
the ﬁrst aperture.

therefore provides a good indication of which limit the

cell is in, with γ ≪ 1 means diﬀusion limit and γ ≫ 1

being discussed here is not the same eﬀect that is seen
in typical supersonic nozzles, where collisions within the
nozzle (as opposed to the volume well before the nozzle)
are important and ﬂow velocities are large compared to
the sonic velocity. The mean ﬂow velocity of He within

FIG. 2: (color online) Guided ﬂux of O2 as a function of cell
temperature. The temperature dependence of the measured
ﬂux is in excellent agreement with the Monte-Carlo simulation
(solid line). The vertical axis represents the absolute guided
fraction (the ratio of the number of guided O2 molecules to
the number exiting the source) as calculated by the simula-
tion. The only free parameter in this ﬁt is the absolute scale.
In order to run for extended periods of time while avoiding
plugging the aperture, this data was taken with oxygen in-
put (0.5 sccm) and lower helium input (0.4 sccm) about one
order of magnitude lower than that used to demonstrate our
−1. The highest ﬂux shown here
peak ﬂux of 3 × 1012 O2 s
−1
represents 2.5 × 1011 O2 s

our cell is typically much less than the speed of sound in
the He gas.

Exact analysis depends on geometrical details, but it
can be easily shown that γ = kA/4ℓL, with k a dimen-
sionless constant of order unity. Ideally one wishes to op-
erate with as large a value of γ (large helium density) as
possible while maintaining an eﬀusive source. If the den-
sity of helium just outside the aperture is large enough
that the mean free path is smaller than the aperture size,
then entrainment outside the aperture results in a signiﬁ-
cant increase in the mean forward velocity (i.e. “forward
boost”) of the beam. This is a detriment to guiding ex-
periments as the boost makes a smaller fraction of the
total beam ﬂux guidable.

Experimental study of these processes is needed to ver-
ify our model. As O2 is very diﬃcult to detect optically,
we chose to characterize the ﬂux and velocity distribu-
tion of the beam with atomic Ytterbium, which has easily
accessible optical transitions.

Two aperture

conﬁgurations were demonstrated.
Fig. 3 shows the output eﬃciency of a “one-stage aper-
ture” (see Fig. 1b) consisting of a simple slit aperture
(1 mm x 4 mm), where this eﬃciency is deﬁned as the
ratio of the number of Yb in the beam to the number
of cold Yb produced by ablation in the cell. At buﬀer
gas ﬂows where γ > 1 (high ﬂows), up to 40% of the
cold Yb atoms in the cell are detected in the resultant

correspond to long diﬀusion times and therefore high γ (see
main text), up to 40% of the cold ablated atoms are detected
in the beam. The peak instantaneous ﬂux represented here is

beam. The divergence of the beam is measured by com-
paring the doppler shifts in the absorbtion spectra par-
allel and transverse to the atomic beam. The beam is
somewhat collimated compared to a pure eﬀusive source,
with a divergence of ≈ 0.1 steradian. The peak ﬂux of
6 × 1015 atom s−1 sr−1 (5 × 1012 atoms/pulse), suggests
that this simple cryogenic one-stage aperture provides an
attractive alternative to seeded supersonic jet sources of
cold molecules[16]. For trapping, where total kinetic en-
ergy must be less than the trap depth, typically a few
K, this beam’s high forward boost (velocity = 130 m
s−1 ≈ 160 K eﬀective temperature) makes it unsuitable.
Trapping work would ideally use a beam with both
high ﬂux and minimal forward boost. In an attempt to
achieve this best of both worlds, the “two-stage aperture”
shown in Fig. 1c was developed. In this two stage aper-
ture the He-Yb mixture still passes through the 1 mm x
4 mm slit with a large hydrodynamic ﬂux enhancement
and corresponding boost. But, instead of directly enter-
ing the vacuum beam region, this boosted beam enters
a small chamber. Atoms can pass from the small cham-
ber through a 12 mm diameter aperture on the opposite
side. This second, larger aperture is covered by a stain-
less steel mesh with pore size 140 microns (28 percent
transparency) and creates a near-eﬀusive beam in the
vacuum region. The He density in the second chamber
would be far too low to thermalize hot atoms entering the
cell. However, it is high enough to thermalize the cold
(but boosted) Yb that comes through the ﬁrst oriﬁce and
low enough so that γ ≪ 1, i.e. diﬀusion dominated dy-

namics. The ﬁnal aperture is large enough to pass into
the beam about 4% of atoms that arrive in the second
chamber. Finally, it is hypothesized that the small pores
in the mesh may help reduce hydrodynamic, non-eﬀusive
ﬂow inside and just outside the nozzle. Preliminary re-
sults in our lab with and without the mesh provide some
evidence that this is the case.

The Yb beam from the two-stage aperture has a mean
velocity 35 m s−1, with a spread of 20 m s−1. The total
beam ﬂux of 5 × 1010 atoms for each Yb ablation pulse
represents about 1% of the cold atomic Yb produced in
the ablation, or about 3% of the output of the one-stage
aperture. In our guided O2 experiments, the two-stage
aperture is used.

IV. POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS

The one-stage aperture cold source described above
can provide high ﬂuxes of any atom or molecule. For
example, under the assumption of 1012 cooled radicals
of CaF per ablation pulse [17] and the use of a 15 Hz
pulsed YAG laser, a 15% duty cycle pulsed beam would
be produced with a continuous ﬂux of 7 × 1013 molecules
s−1 sr−1 (10 ms pulse length, 0.1 sr divergence, peak ﬂux
5 × 1014 molecules s−1sr−1). These ﬂuxes are 500-1000
times higher than typical ﬂuxes from seeded supersonic
beams of radicals at comparable translational and rota-
tional temperatures[16]. As described above, we produce
even brighter cold atomic beams, with a continuous ﬂux
of 7 × 1014 atom s−1 sr−1 (peak ﬂux 5 × 1015 atom s−1
sr−1). This source is therefore an attractive option for
collisional studies and high precision measurements based
on cold molecules as well as atoms [4, 18].

The two-stage aperture source could be applied to
trapping polar molecules. Observing collisions in trapped

5

samples of polar molecules has proved to be diﬃcult, pri-
marily because available ﬂuxes of cold polar molecules
are typically low. Replacing the magnetic guide demon-
strated here with a simple electrostatic guide (as in
[19, 20]) could realize a guided source of polar molecules
with a phase space density 300 times higher than has
been demonstrated to date. We note that the trap life-
times for polar molecules in a 300 K environment are
limited to a few seconds by optical pumping via thermal
microwaves, a constraint which is conveniently avoided
by our cryogenic environment[21].

Although in these experiments atoms and molecules
were introduced into the cell using ablation and gaseous
ﬂow, direct loading from a molecular beam (e.g. oven
or pulsed discharge) is also possible[22, 23]. Thus, this
source is truly general, being able to cool molecules pro-
duced by any technology.

V. CONCLUSION

We have demonstrated production of cold, guided O2
with a ﬂux of 3 × 1012 O2 s−1. We have further demon-
strated a general long-pulse source of cold, unguided
atoms or molecules with peak ﬂux of 5 × 1014 Yb s−1.
The eﬃciency of the unguided source can be near unity,
with the number atoms or molecules in the cold beam
being up to 40% of the number cooled in the cell.

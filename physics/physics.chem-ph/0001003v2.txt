Abstract

We suggest a certain statistical interpretation for the entropy pro-
duced in driven thermodynamic processes. The exponential function
of half
irreversible entropy re-weights the probability of the stan-
dard Ornstein-Uhlenbeck-type thermodynamic ﬂuctuations. (We add
a proof of the standard Fluctuation Theorem which represents a more
natural interpretation.)

In 1910 Einstein [1], paraphrasing [2] Boltzmann’s lapidary formula S =
log W , expressed the probability distribution of thermodynamic variables x
through the entropy function S(x):

W (x)

This equation describes thermodynamic ﬂuctuations in Gaussian approxima-
tion properly. Going beyond the stationary features, the time-dependence of
ﬂuctuations xt can be characterized by a certain probability functional W [x]
over complete paths

where ¯xt is the ‘driving’ value of parameter xt and WOU [z] turns out to
correspond to ﬂuctuations zt of Ornstein-Uhlenbeck type. This relationship
oﬀers Sirr a certain statistical interpretation, somehow resembling Einstein’s
suggestion (1) for the equilibrium entropy S(x).
In this short note, Ein-
stein’s approach to the thermodynamic ﬂuctuations is outlined and standard
equations of time-dependent ﬂuctuations are invoked from irreversible ther-
modynamics. Then I give a precise form to the relationship (2) for driven
thermodynamic processes.

The equilibrium conditions for isolated composite thermodynamic sys-

tems derive from the maximum entropy principle:

S(x) = max ,

(3)

where S(x) is the total entropy of the system in function of certain free
thermodynamic parameters x [3]. If the function S(x) is maximum at x = ¯x
then ¯x is the equilibrium state. For example, x may be the temperature
T of a small (yet macroscopic) subsystem in the large isolated system of
temperature T = ¯x. Then, the function S(x) must be the total entropy of the
isolated system, depending on the variation of the subsystem’s temperature
around its equilibrium value. The equilibrium value ¯x [as well as S(x) itself]
may vary with the deliberate alteration of the initial conditions. Surely,
in our example the temperature T of the whole isolated system can always
be controlled at will. For later convenience, especially in treating driven

In ﬁnite

The relaxation rate λ of ﬂuctuations is related to the corresponding Onsager

bution of xt = zt + ¯x at any ﬁxed time t is the Gaussian distribution (5) as
it must be. For the probability of the complete ﬂuctuation path zt, the zero
mean and correlation (7) are equivalent with the following functional:

parameter ¯x becomes time-dependent. For simplicity’s sake we assume that
the coeﬃcients σ, γ do not depend on ¯x or, at least, that we can ignore
their variation throughout the driven range of ¯xt. We deﬁne the irreversible
entropy production during the driven process as follows:

In our concrete example dSirr = (C/T 2)(T

is indeed the entropy produced randomly by the heat transfer dQ from the
surrounding to the subsystem. By partial integration, Eq. (9) leads to an
alternative form:

In relevant driven processes the entropy production is macroscopic,

I exploit this fact to replace expression (9) by

i.e.,
1 in kB-units, hence it is dominated by the integral term above.

following form for the probability distribution of the driven path:

The non-trivial normalizing pre-factor is a consequence of ¯x’s time-depen-
dence and will be derived below. Since the above distribution is a Gaussian
functional and Sirr[x

This result gives the precise meaning to our symbolic relationship (2).
If the entropy production Sirr were negligible then the thermodynamic ﬂuc-
¯xt would follow the OU statistics (7) like in case of a steady

state ¯xt = const. Even in slow irreversibly driven processes Sirr may grow
essential and exp[Sirr/2] will re-weight the probability of OU ﬂuctuations.
The true stochastic expectation value of an arbitrary functional F [x] can be
expressed by the OU expectation values of the re-weighted functional:

I can verify the plausibility of Eq. (14) for the special case of small ac-
celerations. Let us insert Eqs. (8,11) and also Eq. (13) while ignore ¨¯x in
comparison with λ ˙¯x. We obtain:

W [x

¯x] = WOU [x

¯x + λ−1 ˙¯x] .

Obviously, the ﬂuctuations of the driven system are governed by the OU
process zt (7) in the equilibrium case when ˙¯x
0. In driven process, when
˙¯x
= 0, there is only a simple change: The OU ﬂuctuations happen around
the retarded value ¯xt −
is
equal to the thermodynamic relaxation time 1/λ. Consequently, the driven
random path takes the following form:

where zt is the equilibrium OU process (7). This result implies, in particular,
= ¯xt−τ which is just the retardation eﬀect well-known in the

thermodynamic theory of slightly irreversible driven processes. For example,
in case of an irreversible heating process the subsystem’s average temperature
will always be retarded by τ ˙T with respect to the controlling temperature
T [5].

Finally, let us summarize the basic features of Einstein’s formula (1) and
of the present proposal (2). They characterize the quality of equilibrium in

static and in driven steady states, respectively. They do it in terms of ther-
modynamic entropies while they refer to a statistical context lying outside
both reversible and irreversible thermodynamics. Both formulae are only
valid in the lowest non-trivial order and their correctness in higher orders is
questionable [6]. Contrary to their limited validity, they can no doubt give
an insight into the role of thermodynamic entropy in statistical ﬂuctuations
around both equilibrium or non-equilibrium states.

the exponent was free from the funny factor 1/2. The proof was wrong, of
course. With the factor 1/2, my statistical interpretation for Sirr has become
less attractive. I also realized that a more natural statistical interpretation
[8] was already discovered before. The present formalism oﬀers the following
convenient proof of the Fluctuation Theorem.

The irreversible entropy turns out to be a concrete statistical measure of the

Abstract

A simple and non-destructive method for identiﬁcation of a single molecular ion sympathetically

cooled by a single laser cooled atomic ion in a linear Paul trap is demonstrated. The technique

is based on a precise determination of the molecular ion mass through a measurement of the

eigenfrequency of a common motional mode of the two ions. The demonstrated mass resolution

is suﬃciently high that a particular molecular ion species can be distinguished from other equally

charged atomic or molecular ions having the same total number of nucleons.

In recent years, single molecule research has attracted massive attention. This is not

at least due to its relevance for controlling processes in connection with nanotechnology

and biophysics [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. However, a single molecule represent as well an

ultimate target for invetigations of many chemical physics processes. A single molecular

ion sympathetically cooled [10] through the Coulomb interaction with a single laser cooled

atomic ion in a linear Paul trap [11] represents a translationally cold (T <10 mK) and spa-
tially extremely well-localized target(occupied volume: ∼ 10 µm3) for such single molecule

investigations. In contrast to the situation in many recent investigations of neutral single

molecules [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] where the molecule is either adsorbed on surfaces [1, 2, 3, 5],

contained in a ﬂuid [6, 7, 8] or embedded in a host material [9], a single trapped molecular

ion can essentially be free from perturbations from its environment. This makes it possible

to perform, e.g., well-controlled reaction experiments [12, 13] and studies of quantum co-

herence in photo-ionization and -dissociation processes [14, 15]. The long perturbation free

trapping times (typically of the order of minutes) make it furthermore realistic to consider

laser cooling schemes for the internal degrees of freedom of the molecules[16], a ﬁrst step

towards state selective single molecule studies. A key issue in all such experiments is to

identify the trapped molecular ion species.

In this Letter, we demonstrate a simple technique to uniquely identify a single trapped

molecular ion which relies on a non-destructive measurement of its mass through resonant

excitation of an oscillation mode of the two-ion system.

In the past, the simple relation

between masses and oscillation frequencies has been exploited in a large variety of measure-

ments, including the most precise mass measurement of molecular ions today [17, 18, 19]. In

contrast to these precision experiments, a strong Coulomb coupling between the molecular

ion of interest and an additional atomic ion is essential in our identiﬁcation scheme. For

the harmonic potential of our trap, one can readily show that for two equally charged ions

close to their equilibrium positions, the two eigenfrequencies for their motion along the axis

of alignment are given by [20]

+/− = h(1 + µ) ± q1 − µ + µ2
ν2

iν2
1 ,

(1)

with µ = M1/M2, where M1 and M2 are the masses of the two ions, and ν1 is the oscillation

frequency of a single ion with mass M1. In the following, the corresponding motional modes

will be referred to as the center-of-mass mode (ν−) and the breathing mode (ν+). By

2

determining ν1 for an ion with a known mass M1, the mass M2 of the other ion can be

deduced from a measurement of one of the frequencies ν+ and ν−. For two identical ions

with mass M1, the center-of-mass mode frequency is equal to ν1. Since two equally charged

ions have identical equilibrium positions independent of their masses, it is hence possible

to measure ν1 and ν− with ions located at the same positions in the trap, which minimizes

systematic errors arising from slight anharmonicities in the trap potential.

The essential parts of our experiment are sketched in Fig. 1. The Ca+ ions used in the

experiments to sympathetically cool the molecular ions were produced by an isotope selective

photoionization process [21, 22], while the molecular ions used for illustrating the technique

were produced in reactions between the Ca+ ions and a thermal gas of O2 [13].
experiments, we apply laser cooling to at least one 40Ca+ ion, such that the ions are directly

In the

or sympathetically cooled down to temperatures of a few mK. At such low temperatures, the

ions are localized to within a small fraction of their equilibrium distance [13, 23]. The ions

are forced to line up along the trap axis by making the radial trap frequencies higher than

the axial one. The positions of the 40Ca+ ions are directly be observed by a CCD-camera

through detection of ﬂuorescence light emitted during the laser cooling process. An image

of two 40Ca+ ions is shown in Fig. 2(a). The two-ion eigenfrequencies are measured by

applying a harmonically oscillating perturbing force along the alignment axis. When the

drive frequency of the force is near one of the eigenfrequencies, the amplitude of the ions’s

motion along this axis is enhanced, which for exposure times longer than the oscillation

period leads to a spatial smearing of the ﬂuorescence signal in the CCD-images as shown

in Fig. 2(b). In the experiments we have applied a perturbing force in two diﬀerent ways.

The simplest method consists of applying an oscillating electric ﬁeld along the trap axis by

adding an oscillating voltage to two diagonally positioned end electrodes as shown in Fig. 1.

The other method is based on modulating the radiation pressure force on the laser cooled

ion(s) by a modulation of the laser intensity of one of the beams propagating along the trap

axis (see Fig. 1).

The images presented in Fig. 2 show snapshots from a series of measurements where ν1

was measured for two 40Ca+ ions and ν− for one 40Ca+ ion and one unknown ion, which

presumably is a 40Ca16O+ ion formed in a reaction between one of the ions shown in Fig.

2(a) and an O2 molecule. Figs. 2(a) and 2(c) show the ﬂuorescence from the laser cooled

40Ca+ ions before any perturbing force was applied. Since the single 40Ca+ ion in Fig. 2(c)

3

is located exactly at the same position as one of the ions in Fig. 2(a), we can be conﬁdent

that there is only one non-visible singly charged ion present. When tuning the frequency

of a perturbing electric ﬁeld to maximize the amplitude of the ions’s forced motion for

the two cases presented in Fig. 2, we found the resonance frequencies ν1 = 98.7(1) kHz
and ν− = 89.4(1) kHz, respectively. The mass M1 of the 40Ca+ ion is known to be 39.97

a.m.u., and by combining this with the found frequencies via Eq. 1 one gets M2 = 56.1(4)

a.m.u. Although not impressive, this precision is already suﬃcient to conclude that the non-

visible molecular ion is indeed a 40Ca16O+ ion and not a CaO+ ion with another isotopic

composition.

To discriminate between equally charged atomic or molecular ions with the same total
number of nucleons, a relative mass resolution of ∼ 10−4 is typically needed. This level of

accuracy can not be reached using the simple technique discussed above, since the measured
resonance frequency is subject to a systematic shift of up to ∼1%, depending on the damping

eﬀect of the laser cooling force and the trap frequency. However, by detecting only the in-

phase component of the motion of the ions with respect to the periodic perturbing force, a

dispersive shaped signature of the trap resonance is found. The zero crossing of this curve

yields the trap resonance frequency free of lowest order damping dependent shifts. In this
manner a relative mass resolution better than ∼ 10−4 is indeed feasible[24]. To demonstrate

such a mass resolution, we have chosen to work with ions of diﬀerent isotopes of calcium

as test masses instead of molecular ions, since in our setup it is relatively easy to create

ions of the various isotopes either by isotope selective photoionization[21, 22] or charge

exchange processes[22, 25]. In Fig. 3, the position resolved ﬂuorescence of two 40Ca+ ions

(Fig. 3(a)) and one 40Ca+ ion and one 42Ca+ ion (Fig. 3(b)) is shown as a function of

the intensity modulation frequency of a single cooling laser beam. For these data the laser

intensity was modulated with the laser ﬁeld only present for 1.3 µs in each period, and with

the CCD-camera gated to only record light emitted within a time span of 1.1 µs during

the presence of the modulated light. In both the cases presented in Fig. 3, the phase of

the ions’s motion changes rapidly around a speciﬁc modulation frequency. With M1 being

the mass of the 40Ca+ ion, according to the discusssion above these frequencies equal the

resonance frequencies ν1 and ν−. The resonance frequencies are derived from ﬁts to data

series like those shown in Fig. 3, where the spatial ﬂuorescence intensity distribution of one

ion is modelled by the function I(z, νdrive) = I0 exp n

− [z−z0(νdrive)]2

Γz(νdrive)2 o + IB, where νdrive is

4

the drive frequency, I0 is the ion signal, IB is the background level, z0(νdrive) is the mean

in-phase position of the ion and Γz(νdrive) =

αν
(νdrive−ν−)2+γ2
ν

+ Γres is the spatial width of the

ﬂuorescence signal with Γres being the spatial resolution of the imaging system, γν being the

width of the resonance and αν being a constant related to the amplitude of the forced motion.
Finally, z0(νdrive) = αz(νdrive−ν−)
(νdrive−ν−)2+γ2
ν
modulation forces and αz is a constant related to the amplitude of the forced motion. In Fig.

+ zof f , where zof f is the ion position in the absence of

4, the results of such ﬁts are presented for three combinations of calcium isotopes. From a

statistical analysis of these data, we ﬁnd µ40/42,meas = 0.9526(3) and µ40/44,meas = 0.9095(3),

respectively. Using the best known values for the atomic masses of the calcium isotopes

available [26] and subtracting the mass of one electron, the corresponding expected values

are µ40/42,table = 0.952441 and µ40/44,table = 0.909174, respectively. We see that our relative
mass measurements coincide with the expected ones at a level of 1.4 × 10−4 and 3.4 × 10−4,

respectively. These deviations reﬂect the size of the systematic errors in the experiments

due to the asymmetry, which arises when applying laser cooling to only one ion, as well as

the timing resolution of the camera system [24]. The accuracy in these measurements is

already suﬃcient to discriminate between some singly charged atoms or molecules with an
identical number of nucleons, such as 13C2H+
2 which have a relative mass diﬀerence
of 5.8 × 10−4 [19]. Without signiﬁcant changes in our setup, we should in the future be able
to reach the level of 10−5 or lower [24]. This level of accuracy can of course not compete with

2 and 14N+

the precision of the best dedicated mass measurements scheme [19], but it will certainly be

suﬃcient for most chemical physics experiments.

Since the presented identiﬁcation technique does not rely on spectroscopic sideband res-

olution, it can be applicable in a large variety of experiments. The range of the molecular

mass-to-charge ratio, where the technique can be used, spans at least the range from 2 to
∼ 500, depending on the choice of the laser cooled ion [27]. As already indicated by the

results in Fig. 2, the identiﬁcation technique is an excellent tool in single ion reaction ex-

periments, and its non-destructive nature as well as the short measurement time needed
(∼ 1 min) makes it particularly useful when consecutive reactions [13] or other successive

manipulations are pursued. Since processes leading to a change in the mass or charge of

the target molecule can be detected with essentially 100 % eﬃciency, the technique is very

attractive for, e.g., single molecule photo-ionization or -dissociation studies. This includes

coherent-control experiments [14, 15] with the molecular ion prepared in a speciﬁc internal

5

state, e.g., by cooling techniques [16]. It should be noted that, in contrast to the electrical

perturbation scheme[28], the laser force modulating technique allows easy excitation of both

the center-of-mass mode and the breathing mode, such that both the frequencies ν− and

ν+ can be determined. Knowing these two frequencies, no reference measurement of ν1 is

needed in order to determine M2.

In conclusion, we have presented a simple single molecule identiﬁcation technique which

allows a non-destructive discrimination between equally charged atomic and molecular ions

with an identical number of nucleons. Through the sympathetical cooling procedure a

localized and cold single molecule target is available for further studies in an environment

with very weak perturbations.

FIG. 1: (Color online) Sketch of the experimental setup. The applied linear Paul trap (Trap) gives

rise to an eﬀective three-dimensional harmonic potential for the ions (see Ref.[25]). By making

the oscillation frequency along the trap axis (z-axis) lower than the trap frequencies in the x − y

plane, two cold ions will line up as indicated by the two dots in the ﬁgure. Cooling of the 40Ca+

ion (left (blue) dot) is provided by three laser beams as shown, while the molecular ion (right

(red) dot) will be cooled sympathetically. The forced motion of the ions is induced either by

applying a sinusoidally varying voltage to two end-electrodes of the trap or by modulating the

radiation pressure force from one of the laser beams propagating along the trap axis by chopping

its intensity using an electrooptical chopper (EOC). The ﬂuorescence light from the 40Ca+ ion is

imaged onto a CCD-chip through a fast electronic shutter, which can be gated synchroneously with

the phase of the applied modulated force.

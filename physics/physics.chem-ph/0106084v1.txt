The reliability of the approximations commonly adopted
in the calculation of static optical (hyper)polarizabilities is
tested against exact results obtained for an interesting toy-
model. The model accounts for the principal features of typi-
cal nonlinear organic materials with mobile electrons strongly
coupled to molecular vibrations. The approximations intro-
duced in sum over states and ﬁnite ﬁeld schemes are ana-
lyzed in detail. Both the Born-Oppenheimer and the clamped
nucleus approximations turn out to be safe for molecules,
whereas for donor-acceptor charge transfer complexes devi-
ations from adiabaticity are expected. In the regime of low
vibrational frequency, static susceptibilities are strongly dom-
inated by the successive derivatives of the potential energy
and large vibrational contributions to hyperpolarizabilities
are found. In this regime anharmonic corrections to hyperpo-
larizabilities are very large, and the harmonic approximation,
exact for the linear polarizability, turns out totally inadequate
for nonlinear responses. With increasing phonon frequency
the role of vibrations smoothly decreases, until, in the an-
tiadiabatic (inﬁnite vibrational frequency) regime, vibrations
do not contribute anymore to static susceptibilities, and the
purely electronic responses are regained.

I. INTRODUCTION

Photonic and optoelectronic applications heavily rely
on materials with high nonlinear optical responses, and
the development of new and more eﬃcient materials for
nonlinear optics (NLO) is a key issue in present days re-
search.
In this context, organic materials play an im-
portant role in view of their large and fast NLO re-
sponses and of the tunability of their properties via chem-
ical synthesis.1–4 In order to trace guide-lines to or-
ganic synthesis, much eﬀort is devoted to understand
the origin of nonlinearity in these systems and to re-
late NLO responses to electronic structure and molecular
geometry.3–7 Mobile electrons are required for large non-
linearity and conjugated molecules and/or polymers are
materials of choice for NLO applications.2,3 Vibrations
are strongly coupled to conjugated electrons:8 the eﬀect

optical frequencies is not fully understood yet9–12, but
general agreement has emerged on the importance of e-
ph coupling in static NLO responses.13–15

E0 is the gs energy at zero ﬁeld, µ is the perma-
where
nent dipole moment, α is the linear polarizability, and
β and γ are the ﬁrst and second hyperpolarizabilities,
respectively. As it is always the case for energy deriva-
tives, two diﬀerent methods can be adopted to evaluate
susceptibilities.14 The ﬁrst method, the so-called ﬁnite-
ﬁeld (FF) approach, basically relies on direct numeri-
cal derivation techniques. The relevant system is the
molecule in the presence of an external static electric
ﬁeld.16 The corresponding Hamiltonian is diagonalized
to calculate the gs energy (or dipole moment) at dif-
ferent F values, and (hyper)polarizabilities are calcu-
lated as numerical derivatives of the energy (or dipole
moment) with respect to the electric ﬁeld. The second
approach treats F as a perturbation on the molecular
states, leading to the well-known sum over states (SOS)
formulas.17 The main advantage of SOS over FF is that
only unperturbed (F = 0) eigenstates are required. The
main disadvantage is that all eigenstates and transition
dipole moments are required, whereas FF only requires
the gs energy (or dipole moment). Of course the two
approaches are perfectly equivalent if exact energies and
eigenstates, including vibrational contributions, are in-
serted into equations. But for molecules and, more gen-
erally, for molecular materials, exact vibronic eigenstates
are hardly accessible, and several approximations are in-
troduced. Approximated calculations based on FF or
SOS approaches are clearly diﬀerent and it is important
to investigate the merit and reliability of the various ap-
proximation schemes.

The ﬁrst approximation usually introduced is the adi-
abatic (Born-Oppennheimer, BO) approximation. This
is an almost ubiquitous approximation in molecular and
condensed matter physics: accounting for the diﬀer-
ent masses of electrons and nuclei (and then for the
diﬀerent time scales of their motions), BO approxima-
tion separates electronic and vibrational degrees of free-
dom, so that each state is factorized into a product

1

of an electronic and a vibrational wavefunction. This
approximation is fairly safe: deviations from the adia-
batic regime are expected only for degenerate or quasi-
degenerate states, for narrow-band solids,18 or near to
phase transitions.19

In SOS approaches BO factorization is used to sepa-
rate electronic and vibrational contributions to suscep-
tibilities. Electronic contributions are those where all
summations run on vibronic states in the excited elec-
tronic manifolds, whereas vibrational contributions have
at least one of the indices in the summation running over
excited vibrational states within the gs manifold.20 In the
same spirit as BO, clamped nucleus (CN) approximation
has been proposed to calculate SOS expressions for sus-
ceptibilities in a two-step procedure.21 In the ﬁrst step
the electronic (hyper)polarizabilities are calculated with
nuclei clamped at their equilibrium positions. The re-
sulting electronic contributions to (hyper)polarizabilities
only contain sums over purely electronic states. In the
second step the nuclear motion on the gs potential en-
ergy surface (PES) is accounted for, and vibrational con-
tributions to susceptibilities are obtained. The adiabatic
approximation, as directly applied to SOS or within the
CN formalism, makes the calculation of susceptibilities
possible, provided that electronic and vibrational eigen-
states are known. However, in view of the anharmonicity
of the relevant PES, calculating the vibrational states
in all electronic manifolds (as required in BO-SOS for-
malism) or just in the gs manifold (as required in CN-
SOS) is not easy. Often SOS calculations of static (hy-
per)polarizabilities of molecules and/or polymers are car-
ried out in the harmonic approximation,13,22–24 where
the solution of the vibrational problem can be written in
closed form. Harmonic schemes work in the hypothesis
that the electronic system responds linearly to the nu-
clear motion: harmonic approximation is bound to fail
in systems where vibrations are coupled to mobile elec-
trons, i.e. to electrons characterized by large nonlinear
responses.25,26 In fact large anharmonic corrections to
NLO responses have been recognized in recent ab initio
calculations on conjugated molecules and polymers.27,28
When applied to FF approaches, BO quite naturally
leads to a two-step procedure. First of all the adiabatic
electronic Hamiltonian (i.e. the total Hamiltonian minus
the nuclear kinetic energy, KE, term) is solved to get the
gs electronic energy, that represents the potential energy
(PE) for the nuclear motion. Its derivatives on F measure
the PE contributions to susceptibilities. The calculation
of the PE contribution is easy since only the gs electronic
energy is required. Moreover, if nuclei are allowed to re-
lax in response to F , susceptibilities calculated as PE
derivatives naturally include vibrational contributions,
and fully account for anharmonicity. The second step ac-
counts for KE contribution: this is a more diﬃcult step
because the energy of the lowest vibrational state has to
be calculated as a function of F , a non-trivial task due to
anharmonicity. Moreover, in systems with large e-ph cou-
pling, like conjugated polymers and/or oligomers, it can

be diﬃcult to get reliable calculations of F -dependent ge-
ometries, and numerical instabilities of the energy deriva-
tives are sometimes observed.29

In this paper we critically review the diﬀerent approx-
imation schemes for the calculation of static NLO re-
sponses, when applied to molecules of interest for NLO
applications. In these molecules, in fact, electron-phonon
coupling has particularly large and non-trivial eﬀects,
shedding doubts on the reliability of approximations that
work well in more conventional systems. In particular we
will focus on an interesting toy-model for mobile electrons
coupled to vibrations: the Holstein DA dimer. The so-
called DA dimer is a two-state model originally proposed
by Mulliken to describe electron donor-acceptor charge
transfer (CT) complexes in solution.30 Later on it was
applied by Oudar and Chemla31 to describe push-pull
chromophores where the donor and acceptor moieties are
linked by a π-conjugated bridge to form a molecule. The
extension of the model to include Holstein coupling to vi-
brations was ﬁrst suggested by Person et al.32 to describe
vibrational spectra of CT complexes, and was extensively
discussed in the 80’s to describe many properties (rang-
ing from vibrational spectra to structural instabilities)
of CT salts.33–35 Holstein coupling in the DA dimer has
also been adopted to describe vibrations and/or polar sol-
vation eﬀects in push-pull chromophores15: an extensive
comparison with spectral data for several key molecules
proved that this model contains the main ingredients to
understand nonlinearity in these systems.26,36,37 In spite
of its richness, the model is very simple and in the next
Section we will describe its exact, non-adiabatic eigen-
states, as well as its BO solution. Sections III and IV
discuss the approximations usually introduced in SOS
and FF approaches, respectively; Section V summarizes
main results.

cated by ﬁxing a maximum number of phonon states, M ;
2M matrix can be diagonalized
the corresponding 2M
up to fairly large M values, yielding numerically exact
non-adiabatic eigenstates. The minimum M required to
get convergence depends on the model parameters and
on the properties of interest. All results presented in the
following have been obtained with M = 50.

The exact non-adiabatic eigenstates at F = 0
are inserted into standard SOS expressions for static
susceptibilities25 to get the exact NLO responses re-
ported as continuous lines in Fig. 2 for ǫsp = 1 and
a few ω values. By the way, exactly the same results
are obtained, within FF approach, from the successive
derivatives of the exact non-adiabatic gs energy vs the
applied ﬁeld. In the same ﬁgure, dot-dashed lines cor-
respond to the bare electronic susceptibilities, χ(n)
0 , i.e.
to the response of the two-state model with no e-ph cou-
pling. The deviations of the continuous lines from the
dot-dashed lines measure the vibrational contribution to
static responses. Dashed lines show the PE contribution
to susceptibilities. Analytical expressions for these curves
have already been reported in Ref.15: PE-susceptibilities
are independent of ω. Fig. 2 clearly shows the evolu-
tion of static susceptibilities with phonon frequency: in
the low-ω limit, KE contributions vanish, and the exact
curves tend to the limiting PE results. Vibrational con-
tributions to static susceptibilities are very large in this
limit, and increase with the order of nonlinearity. With
increasing ω, the vibrational contributions to static NLO
responses decrease: in the antiadiabatic limit (ω
)
→ ∞
the vibrational contributions to static hyperpolarizabili-
ties vanishes, and the exact curves tend to the bare elec-
tronic responses.

For real molecules or complexes, the large number of
electronic states makes non-adiabatic calculations very
demanding, and BO approximation is usually invoked.
In BO approximation the eﬀective electronic Hamilto-
1/2P 2, is deﬁned by subtracting the

the Q-dependent ground and excited state energies, as
shown in Fig. 1b. It is important to recognize that, even
if the Hamiltonian in Eq. (2) is deﬁned in terms of har-
monic reference states (Fig. 1a), as a consequence of e-ph
coupling, the ground and excited state PES are anhar-
monic (Fig. 1b). The anharmonicity of the potential pre-
vents the analytical solution of the vibrational problem
on either the ground or excited state; however numeri-
cally exact vibrational states can be calculated in both
manifolds. In particular, the eigenstates of the harmonic
oscillator with frequency ω, centered at the relevant equi-
librium position, are a good basis for the vibrational
problem on either PES. The corresponding vibrational
Hamiltonian is the sum of a KE term, whose matrix el-
ements are trivial in the adopted basis, plus a PE term,
whose matrix elements are calculated via numerical inte-
gration. Of course the vibrational matrix is diagonalized
on a basis truncated to a large enough number of phonon
states as to get convergence. Results presented in this pa-
per have typically been obtained with 20 phonon states.
Once BO eigenstates are obtained, the (transition) dipole
moments entering SOS expressions can be calculated via
numerical integration.

Static susceptibilities calculated within BO approxi-
mation are indistinguishable (in the scale of Fig. 2) from
the exact ones, as long as ω

III. SOS SUSCEPTIBILITIES

The separation of electronic and vibrational degrees
of freedom in BO approximation not only leads to sim-
pler calculations, but also allows for additional insight.

not on pure electronic states. In the reliability range of
BO approximation, closure on vibrational states in the

ceptibilities partly include zero-point vibrational average
(ZPVA) corrections, as deﬁned in Ref.21.

The CN approximation14,20,21 introduces a diﬀerent
way of partitioning electronic and vibrational degrees of
freedom. In this approach the electronic contribution to
the n-th order susceptibility is calculated as the n-th or-
der bare electron susceptibility, χ(n)
0 . Two more contribu-
tions are then added to get the total response: (a) ZPVA
corrections, that account for the diﬀerence between the
electronic susceptibility calculated at the bottom of the
gs PES (i.e. at the equilibrium geometry) and that rele-
vant to the ground vibronic state (due to anharmonicity
the relevant geometry does not coincide with the equilib-
rium one). These corrections are usually calculated via
an expansion of electronic susceptibilities on Q;14 (b) vi-
brational contributions, that are calculated in terms of
summations running on the vibrational states in the gs
manifold only, as detailed in Ref.21.

BO-SOS and CN-SOS are based on the same adiabatic
approximation and lead to basically identical results at
least as long as the adiabatic approximation itself is re-
liable (approximately ω < 0.5). However, the partition-
ing of the susceptibilities is diﬀerent and there is not a
one-to-one correspondence between terms appearing in
the two schemes: CN-SOS kills a few terms appearing
in BO-SOS, and, at the same time, some of the terms,
that are usually considered as corresponding,20 do not

rameters ǫsp = 1, ω = 0.2; for ω = 0.1 deviations are

other, leading to negligible (

(electronic+vibrational) responses.

Our numerical solution of the adiabatic problem for
the two-state model allowed us to test BO and CN ap-
proximations without introducing additional approxima-
tions. However getting exact vibrational eigenstates is
hardly possible for complex (molecular) structures. For
this reason CN-SOS calculations are often implemented
by invoking the harmonic approximation for the vibra-
tional problem.14,20,23,24 As already stressed in the In-
troduction, the harmonic approximation fails in systems
where vibrations are coupled to electrons with large non-
linear responses. The relation between anharmonicity
and nonlinearity is very well apparent in the adopted
model, where both Q and F variables are coupled to
the same electronic operator, ˆρ (cf Eq. (2)). Successive
Q-derivatives of the ground and excited state PE (
EG
EE, respectively) are therefore directly related to F -
and
derivatives, i.e.
to the bare electronic susceptibilities,

large hyperpolarizabilities, i.e. with large χ(n)
2,
are characterized by largely anharmonic ground and ex-
cited state PES. As it has been discussed in Ref.25,26,
the anharmonicity of vibrations coupled to delocalized
electrons is hardly detected in coherent spectral measure-
ments (e.g. electronic and vibrational absorption and/or
Raman spectra), where experimental data can be sat-
isfactorily reproduced in terms of parabolic PES with
eﬀective curvatures, but it shows up with large eﬀects
in incoherent spectral measurements (e.g. steady-state
and/or time-resolved emission).36 Large anharmonic cor-
rections are also expected in static nonlinear optical
responses,25,26 as it is conﬁrmed by extensive ab initio
results on conjugated materials.27,28

The dotted lines in Fig. 2 show the (ω-independent)
susceptibilities calculated in the best harmonic approx-
imation (BHA)25. In this approach the ground and ex-
cited state PES are approximated by the two parabolas
that best ﬁt the two anharmonic PES at the gs equilib-
rium position (i.e. at the minimum of the gs PES): the
relevant curvatures are then deﬁned by Eq. (4) in terms
of the bare electronic linear polarizability evaluated at
the equilibrium geometry. Moreover, all electronic prop-
erties appearing in CN-SOS expressions are truncated

to the linear term in Q.40 We defer a detailed compar-
ison of BHA and exact curves to the next section, here
we only underline that, as far as α is concerned, BHA
and PE estimate exactly coincide, conﬁrming that in the
ω
0 regime anharmonic corrections to the linear polar-
izability tend to vanish25,40. In the same limit, nonlinear
susceptibilities (β and γ) are largely ampliﬁed by the an-
harmonicity of the gs PES, as demonstrated in panels (a)
and (b) of Fig. 2, by the large deviations of BHA results
(dotted lines) from PE curves (dashed lines).

IV. FINITE-FIELD SUSCEPTIBILITIES:
POTENTIAL AND KINETIC ENERGY
CONTRIBUTIONS

In SOS approaches, susceptibilities are naturally par-
titioned into electronic and vibrational contributions.
Within FF approach, on the opposite, PE contributions
to the susceptibilities are naturally separated from con-
tributions due to the nuclear KE. As already discussed in
the Introduction, the lowest eigenstate of the electronic
Hamiltonian as deﬁned in the adiabatic approximation,
is the PE for the motion of nuclei (in the gs manifold,
of course). The total gs energy is obtained by summing
the nuclear KE to the PE. Then, as long as BO applies,
susceptibilities, i.e. the successive derivatives of the gs
energy with respect to an applied electric ﬁeld, can be
calculated as sums of PE and KE F -derivatives. As a
matter of fact, one can further separate the PE contribu-
tion to susceptibilities into an electronic and a vibrational
part by simply comparing derivatives calculated at ﬁxed
nuclear geometry with those taken by allowing nuclei to
relax following the application of the electric ﬁeld.15 This
separation is however fairly artiﬁcial and does not add so
much to our understanding.

The nuclear KE vanishes in the ω = 0 limit, and the
(ω-independent) PE susceptibilities, reported as dashed
lines in Fig. 2, represent the zero-frequency limit of the
exact susceptibilities. Analytical expressions for the PE-
susceptibilities of the Holstein DA dimer were already
reported in Ref.15. More generally, the calculation of PE-
susceptibilities is easily implemented in quantum chem-
istry calculations, in fact it only requires the gs energy
calculated at the relaxed geometry for diﬀerent values
of an externally applied ﬁeld. Of course, geometry op-
timization is a crucial step in FF approach to hyperpo-
larizabilities and it is extremely important to fully re-
lax the geometry for the chosen molecule in order to
avoid spurious ‘strain’ or ‘instability’ contributions to
hyperpolarizabilities.29

The calculation of KE contributions is more diﬃcult,
since the F -dependence of the lowest vibrational state
in the anharmonic gs PES is needed.
In the adopted
model, however, the calculation is feasible and, as long
as BO applies, leads to basically exact results. Specif-
ically, much as it occurs for BO-SOS and CN-SOS, for

≤

ω
0.2 exact (continuous) curves in Fig. 2 are indis-
tinguishable from BO-FF results. The nuclear KE con-
tributes to susceptibilities in two diﬀerent ways. First
of all, due to anharmonicity, the molecular geometry in
the vibronic gs is diﬀerent from the equilibrium geome-
try (corresponding to the minimum of the gs PES). The
PE susceptibilities have, in principle, to be corrected to
account for this eﬀect. The correction is however very
small, and we found it always negligible in the investi-
gated parameter range. The second contribution stems
from the F -dependence of the nuclear KE itself: it is this
contribution that indeed accounts for the deviations of
the exact curves form the (dashed) PE curve (at least in
the BO regime, ω
0.2, where non-adiabatic corrections
are negligible). KE contributions are of course very small
for low ω, but they increase with increasing ω, leading
to an overall decrease of the vibrational ampliﬁcation of
the static NLO responses. This is by no means acciden-
√2t) phonons cannot
tal: in the antiadiabatic limit (ω
contribute to static susceptibilities and, with increasing
ω, KE contributions progressively increase to counterbal-
ance PE contributions.

≫

≤

KE contributions to susceptibilities exactly vanish in
the harmonic approximation.
In fact, the equilibrium
position in any harmonic vibrational state coincides with
the bottom of the PES; moreover the nuclear KE is pro-
portional to the harmonic frequency, i.e. to the curvature
of the PES. For a parabolic PES, this quantity is obvi-
ously independent of Q, and hence of F (cf Eq. (4)). We
are then in the position to prove that the harmonic ap-
proximation is totally uncontrolled for the calculation of
hyperpolarizabilities in any frequency regime. At low ω,
where PE contributions dominate, the harmonic approx-
imation cannot account for anharmonic PES: this has no
eﬀect on the linear response, and the BHA estimate of α
coincides with the exact curve in the ω = 0 limit.25 An-
harmonic contributions to PE-hyperpolarizabilities are
instead large, as demonstrated by the large deviations
of BHA curves from the ω = 0 limiting curves. At the
same time, not accounting for KE corrections, harmonic
results do not represent a reliable approximation in the
large ω regime either. It is possible that in a given pa-
rameter range BHA gives good estimates of a speciﬁc
response, but this is due to an accidental compensation
of two large errors. The harmonic approximation is un-
reliable in the calculation of hyperpolarizabilities, and, as
it turns out clearly from Fig. 2, it is not possible to devise
any parameter range where harmonic results represent a
good approximation for all static susceptibilities.

V. CONCLUSIONS

The Mulliken DA dimer model, extended to account
for the Holstein coupling to vibrations (or equivalently to
other slow degrees of freedom, including the orientational
solvation coordinate), contains the essential physics to

5

understand the subtle interplay between electrons, vi-
brations and external perturbations (namely an electric
ﬁeld) governing NLO responses of molecular materials.15
This simple toy-model is then very useful to test the
reliability of several approximation schemes usually in-
troduced in more reﬁned quantum chemical description
It is important to recognize that
of these materials.
some very well-known and very widely applied approx-
imations can fail when applied to model the properties
of materials with strongly nonlinear behavior. Pertur-
bation theory, and particularly linear perturbation the-
ory, is clearly inadequate in this context, and we already
proved its inadequacy in reproducing spectral proper-
ties of push-pull chromophores26,36,37 as well as their
static susceptibilities.15 More subtle eﬀects have been
demonstrated in two-photon absorption (TPA) spectra,
where the standard Condon approximation badly fails
even when it properly reproduces one-photon absorption
spectra.41 Even more interestingly, an important vibra-
tional channel is found to contribute to TPA spectra, in
addition to standard electronic channels, leading to large
eﬀects in observed spectra.41 The harmonic approxima-
tions works ﬁne in TPA spectra and more generally in
vertical (coherent) processes, but it is inadequate to de-
scribe incoherent processes.26

In this paper we have addressed the approximations
usually introduced in the calculation of static NLO re-
sponses. The adiabatic approximation is fairly safe, at
least as long as phonon frequencies are not too high (ap-
proximately ω < 0.5 t, cf Fig. 3). It can be applied in
diﬀerent ways, BO or CN, in SOS approaches leading to
a slightly diﬀerent partition of electronic and vibrational
contributions to susceptibilities, but to the same overall
result. In FF it leads to a partitioning of potential and
kinetic energy contributions to susceptibilities, but oth-
erwise leads to the same result as in SOS. Closure over
vibrational states is also a very good approximation, as
long as the adiabatic approximation applies.

Potential energy contributions are clearly domi-
nant over kinetic energy contributions in the low-
vibrational frequency regime. The anharmonicity of
the gs PES therefore gives very large corrections to hy-
perpolarizabilities: the harmonic approximation is unten-
able in this regime. With increasing phonon frequency,
kinetic energy contributions globally reduce vibrational
corrections until, in the antiadiabatic limit (ω
) only
electrons respond to static ﬁelds to regain purely elec-
tronic susceptibilities. Kinetic energy corrections vanish
in the harmonic approximation and this approximation
fails in the high frequency regime too.

Both FF and SOS approaches can be easily imple-
mented in quantum chemistry calculations: the former
has the advantage of only requiring knowledge about the
lowest eigenstate, whereas all eigenstates are required in
SOS. However only F = 0 eigenstates are needed in SOS,
whereas the F -dependence of the gs energy (or dipole mo-
ment) is required in FF. Anharmonicity is important and
must be accounted for: in the low-vibrational frequency

limit, where kinetic energy contributions are negligible,
FF calculation is very convenient and fully accounts for
anharmonicity. In the intermediate frequency regime the
PE-FF calculation overestimates the vibrational ampliﬁ-
cation of NLO responses: either KE corrections have to
be introduced in the FF scheme, or one has to make re-
sort to SOS calculations, but in any case anharmonicity
has to be accounted in order to get reliable estimates of
hyperpolarizabilities.

Abstract

We present a mathematically rigorous method suitable for solving three-body
bound state and scattering problems when the inter–particle interaction is of
a hard–core nature. The proposed method is a variant of the Boundary Con-
dition Model and it has been employed to calculate the binding energies for
a system consisting of three 4He atoms. Two realistic He–He interactions of
Aziz and collaborators, have been used for this purpose. The results obtained
compare favorably with those previously obtained by other methods. We
further used the model to calculate, for the ﬁrst time, the ultra-low energy
scattering phase shifts. This study revealed that our method is ideally suited
for three-body molecular calculations where the practically hard–core of the
inter–atomic potential gives rise to strong numerical inaccuracies that make
calculations for these molecules cumbersome.

I. INTRODUCTION

The Boundary Condition Model (BCM) (see, for example, Refs. [1,2]) is of interest due
to its simplicity in describing the short-range component of the interaction between parti-
cles. In the BCM the interaction is speciﬁed by boundary conditions imposed on the wave
function when the particles approach each other at a certain distance r = c. The so-called

hard core potentials represent a particular variant of the BCM where one requires that the
wave function vanishes at r = c. Such a requirement is equivalent to an introduction of
an inﬁnitely strong repulsion between particles at distances r
c. The standard formalism
for scattering [3,4] does not deal with hard-core interactions described by these boundary
conditions. Therefore a derivation of special equations to handle this class of interactions is
desirable.

≤

Replacement of the ﬁnite, for r > 0, but often singular at r = 0, repulsive short-range
part of the potential with a hard-core interaction turns out to be a very eﬀective way to
suppress inaccuracies related to a numerical approximation of the Schr¨odinger operator at
short distances. Although in two–body applications these potentials are easy to handle,
in three-body systems certain mathematical diﬃculties appear [5], which are absent when
conventional potentials are used.

To overcome these diﬃculties various approaches were considered. We shall recall here
the two main ones related to the Faddeev equations [3,4]. In the ﬁrst, a certain limiting
procedure is used where special potentials that include only a ﬁnite repulsive core are con-
structed at a ﬁrst step. The parameters of these potentials are then chosen so that the ﬁnal
two-body wave function satisﬁes the desired boundary conditions [6–8]. The corresponding
two-body t–matrices are subsequently substituted into the Faddeev integral equations [6,8]
under an implicit assumption that the latter are still valid. The resulting equations are con-
sidered as a generalization of the Faddeev equations for the BCM. A similar approach was
also used in Refs. [1,9,10]. A common feature of the reduced equations in these approaches is
that they are not of a Fredholm type and that they have not a unique solution at all energy
values, including the complex ones. To obtain a unique solution one is forced to introduce
auxiliary conditions or relations [1,10].

In the second approach, three–body integral equations of a Fredholm type are derived in
the BCM model without any limiting procedure. Instead, one uses the fact that the spectral
problem for the Schr¨odinger operator is an example of a classical boundary–value problem
for elliptic diﬀerential equation in partial derivatives of the second order. One of the tradi-
tional methods to deal with such problems is the Potential Theory [11]. An approach to the
three–body problem in the BCM which is based on the Potential Theory was developed in
Refs. [12–15] (see also [2] and [16]). However, in contrast to the boundary value problems
for compact surfaces, the initial three-body equations were not of Fredholm type, similarly
to the three–body Lippmann–Schwinger equation in the case of the conventional soft–core
potentials. This is due to the same reason, i.e, the noncompactness of the support of the two-
body interaction in the three-body conﬁguration space. To overcome this problem, these
equations were rearranged in Refs. [12–15] using the Faddeev method [3]. The resultant
equations are of Fredholm type and suitable for use in the three-particle scattering problem.
These developments allowed the reformulation of the Faddeev equations for the bound state
and scattering problems in conﬁguration space in terms of boundary-value problems which
are suitable for numerical calculations. This was demonstarted in three-nucleon bound-state
and scattering calculations [13,16].

In this work we shall present a hard core version of the BCM formalism [12–15] and apply
it to the three-atomic 4He system. Various methods have been used in the past to study the
ground state properties of 4He molecules. We mention here the Variational Method (VM)
[17–20], the Variational Monte Carlo method (VMC) [21,22], the Green Function Monte
Carlo method (GFMC) [22–27], the methods based on Faddeev integral equations in mo-
mentum space [28,29] and Faddeev diﬀerential equations in conﬁguration space [30], the
hyperspherical methods [31–33]. From the experimental works we mention those of Refs.
[34–37] where molecular clusters consisting of a small number of noble gas atoms were in-
vestigated.

The interaction between bosons in such clusters is usually described by central poten-
tials having a very strong repulsive cores [38–42]. In the present work, we approximate the
strong repulsion between the Helium atoms at short distances by a hard core and solve the
corresponding boundary value problems for the Faddeev–type diﬀerential equations. We
shall show that the method gives excellent results for the ground-state energy of the Helium
4He trimer. It furher allowed the calculation of an excited state interpreted in [29,33] as an
Eﬁmov one [43]. Moreover, we shall demonstrate that the method is suitable for scattering
calculations at ultra-low energies below as well as above the breakup threshold.

Equations (10), (12), and (13) describe the boundary value problem for three-body bound
systems with hard-core interactions and are a natural generalization of the Faddeev diﬀer-
ential formulation [4] for bound states.

The numerical advantage of our approach is already obvious from the structure of Eqs.
(10): When a potential with a strong repulsive core is replaced with the hard-core model, one
approximates, inside the core domains, only the Laplacian
∆X , instead of the sum of the
Laplacian and a huge repulsive term, and in this way a much better numerical approximation
can be achieved.

A detail analysis for the boundary-value problems described above, the derivation of the
asymptotic boundary conditions for scattering states as well as other boundary-value formu-
lations, can be found in Refs. [15,16]. Here, we only recall, brieﬂy, some peculiar properties
of the discrete spectrum generated by the condition (12). As compared to the spectrum of
the initial Hamiltonian deﬁned by Eqs. (2) and (3), this spectrum acquires an additional
component, corresponding to the Dirichlet boundary-value problems for the domains which
result from the intersection of the cylinders Γα. We introduce the following notations for
these domains: Let Λαβγ be a domain restricted by all the three cylinders Γα, α = 1, 2, 3,
and ∂Λαβγ be its boundary (see Figs. 1 and 2). The notation Λαβ is used for a part of the
= α, and at the same time is external with
domain bounded by the cylinders Γα and Γβ, β
respect to the set Λαβγ. By Λα we denote the domain bounded by the cylinder Γα which is
at the same time external to the rest cylinders Γβ, β
= α. The notations ∂Λαβ and ∂Λα are
used for the boundaries of the domains Λαβ and Λα, respectively.

It can be shown [15] that the discrete spectrum of the boundary-value problem (10), (12),
and (13) includes not only the discrete spectrum σd(H) of the original Hamiltonian H but
also a set σaux
consisting of a discrete set of eigenvalues of the homogeneous internal Dirichlet
problems in the domains Λαβγ, Λαβ, and Λα, α, β = 1, 2, 3, β

of the spectral problem described by (10), (12), and (13) corresponding to the spectrum of
the Hamiltonian H only. This is just the requirement (see also the condition (11)) that the
total wave function inside the cylinders Γα vanishes,

IV. APPLICATION TO THE THREE-ATOMIC 4He SYSTEM

We employed the Faddeev equations (33) and the hard-core boundary condition (39)
to calculate the binding energies of the Helium atomic trimer and the ultra–low energy
phase shifts of the Helium atom scattered oﬀ the Helium diatomic molecule. As a 4He–4He
interatomic interactions we use the HFDHE2 [39] and HFD-B [40] potentials of Aziz and
co-workers. Both HFDHE2 and HFD-B potentials have the form

For completeness the parameters for both HFDHE2 and HFD-B potentials are given in Ta-

In the present work we restrict ourselves to calculations for S-states only. The partial
components Φlλ0 can be obtained in this case from the addition of even partial waves l and
λ with l = λ. To demonstrate the feasibility of our formalism and the accuracy which can
be achieved, we obtained solutions with l = 0 and l = 2 which can be compared with other
results in the literature. The ﬁnite–diﬀerence approximation in the polar coordinates ρ and
θ has been used for this purpose, a description of which is given in the Appendix.

Both potentials considered, produce a weakly bound state of the Helium dimer. Our
calculations with ¯h2/m = 12.12 K ˚A2 gave for its energy ǫd the value of
0.830 mK in the
1.686 mK in the case of HFD-B potential. These results are in
case of the HFDHE2 and
agreement with other theoretical results found in the literature [29,33,46]. The estimated
experimental value is ǫd ∼ −
1 mK [36,37]). Since the bound–state energy is four orders
smaller than the potential depth, the constant ¯h2/m must be taken with a high accuracy.
Unfortunately, diﬀerent authors used diﬀerent values for ¯h2/m and this generates certain
diﬃculties in comparing results. Thus, for comparison purposes, we used also the value
¯h2/m = 12.1 K ˚A2. With ¯h2/m = 12.1 K ˚A2 the dimer energy was found to be
0.966 mK
1.877 mK with the HFDHE2 and HFD-B potentials respectively.

The results of the Helium trimer ground-state energy E(0)

calculations are presented
in Table II. It is seen that they are in a good agreement with other results given in the
literature. Although the two potentials used diﬀer only slightly, they produce important
diﬀerences in the ground-state energy. This is in agreement with the ﬁnding of Ref. [32] but
in disagreement with the statement made in Ref. [20]. It should be further noted that most
of the contribution to the binding energy stems from the l = λ = 0 and l = λ = 2 partial
component the latter being more than 35 %. The contribution from the l = λ = 4 partial
wave was shown in [30] to be of the order of a few per cent.

In Ref. [29] Cornelius and Gl¨ockle investigated the possibility of having Eﬁmov states
in the Helium trimer. Their work was motivated by the fact that the dimer energy ǫd is
very close to the three-body threshold. Employing the HFDHE2 potential, these authors
found an excited state at E(1)
1.6 mK. This ﬁnding was recently conﬁrmed by Esry et
al. [33] who also located an excited state at E(1)
1.517 mK using the same HFDHE2
inter-atomic interaction. Note that the approaches used in [29] and [33] are completely dif-
ferent. The former is based on the Faddeev integral equations in momentum space while in
the later on the hyperspherical adiabatic approach. By noting that the three-body excited
state disappears when the interaction strength increases, both, Cornelius and Gl¨ockle and
In [33] the improved LM2M2 4He–4He
Esry et al., identify this state as an Eﬁmov one.
potential [41] was also employed and an excited state at E(1)
2.118 mK was found. We
have also found that the Helium trimer can form an excited state with both the HFDHE2
and HFD-B potentials. The excited state is present even when only the l = λ = 0 partial
wave is taken into account. This is in agreement with the ﬁnding of Ref. [29]. Our excited
state results are given in Table III.

We also performed calculations for a Helium atom scattered oﬀ a Helium dimer, at L = 0.

The phase shifts results thus obtained are given in Tables IV, V, and plotted in Fig. 3.
We considered incident energies below as well as above the breakup threshold, i. e., for the
(2 + 1
1 + 1 + 1) processes. In order to obtain converged
results we were compelled to integrate upto a maximum ρmax = 400—600 ˚A. This comes
as no surprise since the two–body binding energy is very small implying an extended 4He
dimer system and thus the trimer wave functions attain their asymptotic values at very
large distances. Changing ρmax in the range 400—600 ˚A produces minimal eﬀects on the
phase shifts. Such a cut-oﬀ radius in the three 4He atom problem may be compared with
the characteristic values ρmax =20—30 fm for the three-nucleon problem (see, for example,
the recent paper [47] and Refs. therein). This is not an unexspected result since the dimer

wave function generated, for example, by the HFD-B potential, behaves as exp(
large distances (where x is measured in ˚A) while the deuteron wave function as exp(
0.23x)

d scattering problem are equivalent to 400—600 ˚A in the three 4He atoms scattering.

V. CONCLUSIONS

In this work we employ a formalism which is suitable for three–body calculations with
hard–core potentials. The approach is a hard-core variant of the Boundary-Condition Model
and, unlike some competing methods, is exact and ideally suited for three-body calculations
with two–body interactions with a highly repulsive core which can be treated as a hard–core.
Furthermore the method is feasible not only for bound–state but for scattering processes as
well.

We employed the formalism to calculate the binding energy of the 4He–trimer system.
The results obtained with two realistic 4He–4He potentials compared favorably with other
results in the literature. Furthermore, we successfully located an excited state which can
be interpreted [29,33] as an Eﬁmov state. This clearly demonstrates the reliability of our
method in three-body bound state calculations with hard-core potentials. We also endeav-
ored to calculate, for the ﬁrst time, the ultra-low energy scattering phase shifts corresponding
to a 4He atom scattered oﬀ a 4He dimer.

The eﬀectively hard-core inter-atomic potential together with other characteristics of
the system, make such calculations extremely tedious and numerically unstable. However,
this is not the case with our approach where the hard–core is taken from the beginning
into account in a mathematically rigorous way. The successful application of the proposed
method revealed that this method is ideally suited for calculations in systems where the
strong repulsion in the pairwise forces gives rise to strong numerical inaccuracies which

15

make calculations for these molecules cumbersome. Thus the formalism paves the way to
study various ultra–cold three-atomic systems, and to calculate important quantities such
as the cross-sections, recombination rates [48] etc.

APPENDIX A: NUMERICAL METHOD

The ﬁnite-diﬀerence approximation in polar coordinates ρ and θ has been used to solve
this problem. For this, the grid knots were chosen to be the points of intersection of the arcs
ρ = ρi, i = 1, 2, . . . , Nρ, and the rays θ = θj, j = 1, 2, . . . , Nθ. The value of the parameter
c (“diameter” of the particle cores) is chosen in such a way that any further decrease of it
does not aﬀect the trimer ground-state energy. In the present case a four ﬁgure accuracy
has been achieved with c = 0.7 ˚A.

The ρi points were chosen according to the formulas

Such a choice of the grid is prescribed by the need to have the points of intersection of the
arcs ρ = ρi and the rays θ = θj with the core line x = c as its knots. Furthermore, the
grid must be constructed in such a manner so that the density of the points is higher where
the Faddeev components are important, i. e., for small values of ρ and/or x, and lower in

17

the asymptotic region. Usually we took the same numbers of grid points for both θ and ρ,
Nθ = Nρ. For Nc we chose N (ρ)

c = 5.

The maximal ρ value used, ρmax = ρNρ, in our ground-state of the Helium 4He trimer
calculations was 60 ˚A. Beyond this radius the eﬀects on the bound state are minimal. For
the excited state calculations we were obliged to increase the ρmax to 200—400 ˚A and for the
scattering calculations to 400—600 ˚A.

A description of a ﬁnite-diﬀerence algorithm of solving the Faddeev diﬀerential equa-
tions for conventional potentials was given in [4,44]. A generalization of this algorithm
to the boundary-condition model for the three-nucleon problem was previously employed
in [13,15,16]. Here, we shall describe in more detail an extension of the algorithm [44] to
the hard-core boundary conditions problems. For simplicity we restrict ourselves to the
(2 + 1
2 + 1 ; 1 + 1 + 1) scattering and the bound-state boundary-value problems where
only one Faddeev partial equation with l = 0 is considered.

of its spherical part, the potential, and the integral operator on the arc ρ = ρi . In the cases
where i, j are such that ρi cos θj = c, the respective rows of the matrices Li, Mi, and Ri
are generated by the condition (39). The matrix ˜Ii diﬀers from the unity one only in a row
corresponding to the boundary condition (39). This row in ˜Ii has zero elements.

The system (A4) includes Nθρ equations for Nθρ + Nθ unknowns. An additional relation

Having determined the vectors

X1, we can then proceed, via the asymptotics (45),
to ﬁnd the elastic scattering amplitude a0(p). For this we may use two methods. In the
ﬁrst one, we compare the representations (45) and (A10) on the arc ρ = ρNρ in those knots
(ρNρ, θj) of the grid for which the value of ρNρ cos θj belongs to a vicinity of the point x0
where the dimer wave function ψd(x) is maximal, ψd(x0) = max ψd(x). In this vicinity, the
term with the spherical wave exp(i√Eρ)/√ρ is much smaller than the “elastic” wave term
ψd(x) exp(ipy) (if ρNρ is suﬃciently large). Therefore, omitting the breakup term we obtain
from (A10) the following expression

To eliminate the vector

(Nρ+1) from the last (i = Nρ) equation of (A4) we use the
representation (44). For angles corresponding to the knots of the arc ρ = ρNρ lying inside
the core domain, ρNρ cos θj < c, we write the components
on the two

successive arcs ρ = ρNρ and ρ = ρNρ+1, taking into account the condition ψd(x) = 0, x

Note that the matrices ˜LNρ and ˜MNρ depend on the energy E since the function χ1 and the
coeﬃcients C ±Nρ are functions of E. Therefore the total matrix K of the system obtained is
also a function of E, K = K(E). In this work we searched for binding energies of the 4He
trimer as roots of the determinant det

The use of the asymptotic boundary conditions (44) in the form of (A17)–(A19) is ex-
tremely important when searching for the excited E(1)
state. It is diﬃcult to locate this state
if the term a0ψd(x) exp(i√E
ǫd y) is omitted. This means that the dimer wave function
ψd(x) gives a decisive contribution into the excited state. In contrast, omitting this term
(and replacing w(Nρ)
Nρ for
all j = 1, . . . , Nθ) in the ground-state calculations simpliﬁes the problem considerably by
allowing the decrease of the cut-oﬀ radius to 60 ˚A. Otherwise, to obtain the correct result
for E(0)
t we had to increase ρNρ up to 150—200 ˚A as the dimer wave function falls oﬀ very
slowly.

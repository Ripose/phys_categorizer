We present classical trajectory calculations of the rota-
tional vibrational scattering of a non-rigid methane molecule
from a Ni(111) surface. Energy dissipation and scattering
angles have been studied as a function of the translational ki-
netic energy, the incidence angle, the (rotational) nozzle tem-
perature, and the surface temperature. Scattering angles are
◦
somewhat towards the surface for the incidence angles of 30
,
45◦, and 60◦ at a translational energy of 96 kJ/mol. Energy
loss is primarily from the normal component of the transla-
tional energy. It is transfered for somewhat more than half
to the surface and the rest is transfered mostly to rotational
motion. The spread in the change of translational energy
has a basis in the spread of the transfer to rotational energy,
and can be enhanced by raising of the surface temperature
through the transfer process to the surface motion.

I. INTRODUCTION

The dissociative adsorption of methane on transition
metals is an important reaction in catalysis; it is the rate
limiting step in steam reforming to produce syngas, and
it is prototypical for catalytic C–H activation. There-
fore the dissociation is of high interest for many surface
scientists. (See for a recent review Ref. 1.) Molecular
beam experiments in which the dissociation probability
was measured as a function of translational energy have
observed that the dissociation probability is enhanced by
the normal incidence component of the incidence trans-
lational energy.2–12 This suggests that the reaction oc-
curs primarily through a direct dissociation mechanism
at least for high translational kinetic energies. Some ex-
periments have also observed that vibrationally hot CH4
dissociates more readily than cold CH4, with the energy
in the internal vibrations being about as eﬀective as the
translational energy in inducing dissociation.2–4,8,7,13,9,10
A molecular beam experiment with laser excitation of the
ν3 mode did succeed in measuring a strong enhancement
of the dissociation on a Ni(100) surface. However, this

enhancement was still much too low to account for the vi-
brational activation observed in previous studies and in-
dicated that other vibrationally excited modes contribute
signiﬁcantly to the reactivity of thermal samples.14

It is very interesting to simulate the dynamics of the
dissociation, because of the direct dissociation mecha-
nism, and the role of the internal vibrations. Wave packet
simulations of the methane dissociation reaction on tran-
sition metals have treated the methane molecule always
as a diatomic up to now.15–20 Apart from one C–H bond
(a pseudo ν3 stretch mode) and the molecule surface dis-
tance, either (multiple) rotations or some lattice motion
were included. None of these studies have looked at the
role of the other internal vibrations, so there is no model
that describes which vibrationally excited mode might
be responsible for the experimental observed vibrational
activation.

In previous papers we have reported on wave packet
simulations to determine which and to what extent in-
ternal vibrations are important for the dissociation in
the vibrational ground state of CH4,21 and CD4.22 We
were not able yet to simulate the dissociation including
all internal vibrations. Instead we simulated the scatter-
ing of methane in ﬁxed orientations, for which all inter-
nal vibrations can be included, and used the results to
deduce consequences for the dissociation. These simula-
tions indicate that to dissociate methane the interaction
of the molecule with the surface should lead to an elon-
gated equilibrium C–H bond length close to the surface,
and that the scattering was almost elastic. Later on we
reported on wave packet simulations of the role of vibra-
tional excitations for the scattering of CH4 and CD4.23
We predicted that initial vibrational excitations of the
asymmetrical stretch (ν3) but especially the symmetri-
cal stretch (ν1) modes will give the highest enhancement
of the dissociation probability of methane. Although we
have performed these wave packet simulations in ten di-
mensions, we still had to neglect two translational and
three rotational coordinates of the methane molecule and
we did not account for surface motion and corrugation.
It is nowadays still hard to include all these features into

1

a wave packet simulation, therefore we decided to study
these with classical trajectory simulations.

In this article we will present full classical trajectory
simulations of methane from a Ni(111) surface. We have
especially interest in the eﬀect of the molecular rota-
tions and surface motion, which we study as a function
of the nozzle and surface temperature. The methane
molecule is ﬂexible and able to vibrate. We do not
include vibrational kinetic energy at the beginning of
the simulation, because a study of vibrational excita-
tion due to the nozzle temperature needs a special semi-
classical treatment. Besides its relevance for the disso-
ciation reaction of methane on transition metals, our
scattering simulation can also be of interest as a refer-
ence model for the interpretation of methane scattering
itself, which have been studied with molecular beams
on Ag(111),24,25 Pt(111),26–29 and Cu(111) surfaces.30
It was observed that the scattering angles are in some
cases in disagreement with the outcome of the classi-
cal Hard Cube Model (HCM) described in Ref. 31.26,27
We will show in this article that the assumptions of this
HCM model are too crude for describing the processes
obtained from our simulation. The time-of-ﬂight experi-
ments show that there is almost no vibrational excitation
during the scattering,28,29 which is in agreement with
our current classical simulations and our previous wave
packet simulations.21,22

The rest of this article is organized as follows. We start
with a description of our model potential, and an expla-
nation of the simulation conditions. The results and dis-
cussion are presented next. We start with the scattering
angles, and relate them to the energy dissipation pro-
cesses. Next we will compare our simulation with other
experiments and theoretical models. We end with a sum-
mary and some general conclusions.

II. COMPUTATIONAL DETAILS

We have used classical molecular dynamics for sim-
ulating the scattering of methane from a Ni(111) sur-
face. The methane molecule was modelled as a ﬂexible
molecule. The forces on the carbon, hydrogen, and Ni
atoms are given by the gradient of the model potential
energy surface described below. The ﬁrst-order ordinary
diﬀerential equations for the Newtonian equations of mo-
tion of the Cartesian coordinates were solved with use of
a variable-order, variable-step Adams method.32 We have
simulated at translational energies of 24, 48, 72, and 96
kJ/mol at normal incidence, and at 96 kJ/mol for inci-
dence angles of 30◦, 45◦, and 60◦ with the surface normal.
The surface temperature and (rotational) nozzle temper-
ature for a certain simulation were taken independently
between 200 and 800 K.

A. Potential energy surface

The model potential energy surface used for the clas-
sical dynamics is derived from one of our model poten-
tials with elongated C–H bond lengths towards the sur-
face, previously used for wave packet simulation of the
vibrational scattering of ﬁxed oriented methane on a ﬂat
surface.21,22 In this original potential there is one part
responsible for the repulsive interaction between the sur-
face and the hydrogens, and another part for the in-
tramolecular interaction between carbon and hydrogens.
We have rewritten the repulsive part in pair potential
terms between top layer surface Ni atoms and hydrogens
in such a way that the surface integral over all these Ni
atoms give the same overall exponential fall-oﬀ as the
original repulsive PES term for a methane molecule far
away from the surface in an orientation with three bonds
pointing towards the surface. The repulsive pair interac-
tion term Vrep between hydrogen i and Ni atom j at the
surface is then given by

Vrep =

A e−αZij
Zij

,

(1)

(2)

where Zij is the distance between hydrogen atom i and
Ni atom j.

The intramolecular potential part is split up in bond,
bond angle, and cross potential energy terms. The single
C–H bond energy is given by a Morse function with bond
lengthening towards the surface

Vbond = De h1

where De is the dissociation energy of methane in the gas
phase, and Ri is the length of the C–H bond i. Disso-
ciation is not possible at the surface with this potential
term, but the entrance channel for dissociation is mim-
icked by an elongation of the equilibrium bond length Req
when the distance between the hydrogen atom and the
Ni atoms in the top layer of the surface become shorter.
This is achieved by

Req = R0 + S

a way that the elongation is 0.054 nm at the classical
turning point of 93.2 kJ/mol incidence translational en-
ergy for a rigid methane molecule, when the molecule
approach a surface Ni atom atop with one bond pointing
towards the surface. The single angle energy is given by
the harmonic expression

The u’s are the displacements from the equilibrium po-

with a nearest-neighbour distance of 0.2489 nm. The pa-
rameters λij and µij were ﬁtted on the elastic constants35
and cell parameters36 of the bulk. The values of all pa-
rameters are given in Table I.

B. Simulation model

The surface is modelled by a slab consisting of four
layers of eight times eight Ni atoms. Periodic boundary
conditions have been used in the lateral direction for the
Ni-Ni interactions. The methane molecule has interac-
tions with the sixty-four Ni atoms in the top layer of the
slab. The surface temperature is set according to the
following procedure. The Ni atoms are placed in equilib-
rium positions and are given random velocities out of a
Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution with twice the surface
temperature. The velocities are corrected such that the
total momentum of all surface atoms is zero in all direc-
tions, which ﬁxes the surface in space. Next the surface is
allowed to relax for 350 fs. We do the following ten times
iteratively. If at the end of previous relaxation the total
kinetic energy is above or below the given surface tem-
perature, then all velocities are scaled down or up with a
factor of √1.1 respectively. Afterwards a new relaxation
simulation is performed. The end of each relaxation run
is used as the begin condition of the surface for the actual
scattering simulation.

The initial perpendicular carbon position was chosen
180 nm above the equilibrium z-position of the top layer

atoms and was given randomly parallel (x, y) positions
within the central surface unit cell of the simulation slab
for the normal incidence simulations. The methane was
placed in a random orientation with the bonds and an-
gles of the methane in the minimum of the gas phase
potential. The initial rotational angular momentum was
generated randomly from a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribu-
tion for the given nozzle temperature for all three rota-
tion axis separately. No vibrational kinetic energy was
given initially. Initial translational velocity was given to
all methane atoms according to the translational energy.
The simulations under an angle were given parallel mo-
mentum in the [110] direction. The parallel positions
have been translated according to the parallel velocities
in such a way that the ﬁrst collision occurs one unit cell
before the central unit cell of the simulation box. We
tested other directions, but did not see any diﬀerences
for the scattering.

Each scattering simulation consisted of 2500 trajecto-
ries with a simulation time of 1500 fs each. We calculated
the (change of) translational, total kinetic, rotational and
vibrational kinetic, intramolecular potential, and total
energy of the methane molecule; and the scattering an-
gles at the end of each trajectory. We calculated for
them the averages and standard deviations, which gives
the spread for the set of trajectories, and correlations co-
eﬃcients from which we can abstract information about
the energy transfer processes.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

We will now present and discuss the results of our sim-
ulations. We begin with the scattering angle distribu-
tion. Next we will explain this in terms of the energy
dissipation processes. Finally we will compare our sim-
ulation with previous theoretical and experimental scat-
tering studies, and discuss the possible eﬀects on the dis-
sociation of methane on transition metal surfaces.

A. Scattering angles

Figure 1 shows the scattering angle distribution for dif-
ferent incidence angles with a initial total translational
energy of 96 kJ/mol at nozzle and surface temperatures
of both 200 and 800 K. The scatter angle is calculated
from the ratio between the normal and the total paral-
lel momentum of the whole methane molecule. We ob-
serve that most of the trajectories scatter some degrees
towards the surface from the specular. This means that
there is relatively more parallel momentum than normal
momentum at the end of the simulation compared with
the initial ratio. This ratio change is almost completely
caused by a decrease of normal momentum.

The higher nozzle and surface temperatures have al-
most no inﬂuence on the peak position of the distribu-
tion, but give a broader distribution. The standard de-
viation in the scattering angle distribution goes up from
2.7◦, 2.4◦, and 2.2◦ at 200K to 4.4◦, 3.8◦, and 3.4◦ at
800K for incidence angles of 30◦, 45◦, and 60◦ respec-
tively. This means that the angular width is very nar-
row, because the full width at half maximum (FWHM)
are usually larger than 20◦.37 (The FWHM is approxi-
mately somewhat more than twice the standard devia-
tion.) The broadening is caused almost completely by
raising the surface temperature, and has again primarily
an eﬀect on the spread of the normal momentum of the
molecule. This indicates that the scattering of methane
from Ni(111) is dominated by a thermal roughening pro-
cess.

We do not observe an average out-of-plane diﬀraction
for the non normal incidence simulations, but we do see
some small out-of-plane broadening. The standard de-
viations in the out-of-plane angle were 0.9◦, 1.8◦, 3.4◦
at a surface temperature of 200K, and 1.7◦, 3.3◦, and
6.0◦ at 800K for incidence angles of 30◦, 45◦, and 60◦
with the surface normal. Raising the (rotational) noz-
zle temperature has hardly any eﬀect on the out-of-plane
broadening.

B. Energy dissipation processes

1. Translational energy

Figure 2 shows the average energy change of some en-
ergy components of the methane molecule between the
end and the begin of the trajectories as a function of the
initial total translational energy. The incoming angle for
all is 0◦ (normal incidence), and both the nozzle and sur-
face are initially 400K. If we plot the normal incidence
translational energy component of the simulation at 96
kJ/mol for the diﬀerent incidence angles, then we see a
similar relation. This means that there is normal transla-
tional energy scaling for the scattering process in general,
except for some small diﬀerences discussed later on.

FIG. 1. The distribution of the scattering angle for a total
initial translational energy of 96 kJ/mol with incidence angles
of 0◦, 30◦, 45◦, and 60◦ with the surface normal. Both the
nozzle and surface temperature are: a) 200K, and b) 800K.

Most of the initial energy of methane is available as
translational energy, so it cannot be surprising that we
see here the highest energy loss. The translational energy
loss takes a higher percentage of the initial translational
energy at higher initial translational energies. Since al-
most all of the momentum loss is in the normal direction,
we also see that the loss of translational energy can be
found back in the normal component of the translational
energy for the non-normal incidence simulations.

The average change of the total energy of the methane
molecule is less negative than the average change in trans-
lational energy, which means that there is a net transfer
of the initial methane energy towards the surface dur-
ing the scattering. This is somewhat more than half of
the loss of translational energy. The percentage of trans-
fered energy to the surface related to the normal inci-
dence translational energy is also enhanced at higher in-
cidence energies. There is somewhat more translational
energy loss, and energy transfer towards the surface for
the larger scattering angles, than occurs at the compa-
rable normal translational energy at normal incidence.
This is caused probably by interactions with more sur-
face atoms, when the molecule scatters under an larger
angle with the surface normal.

In Fig. 2 we also plotted the average change of methane
potential energy and the change of rotational and vibra-
tional kinetic energy of methane. We observe that there
is extremely little energy transfer towards the potential
energy, and a lot of energy transfer towards rotational

4

and vibrational kinetic energy. Vibrational motion gives
an increase of both potential and kinetic energy. Rota-
tional motion gives only an increase in kinetic energy. So
this means that there is almost no vibrational inelastic
scattering, and very much rotational inelastic scattering.

is almost the same. This is caused by the fact that at
large angles deviations in the normal direction has more
eﬀect on the deviation in the angle than at smaller angles
with the normal.

methane translational energy, the methane total energy, the

temperature were 400K.

Figure 3 shows the standard deviations in the energy
change of some energy components of methane versus the
initial translational energy at normal incidence for a noz-
zle and surface temperature of 200K. (The temperature
eﬀects will be discussed below.) The standard deviations
in the energy changes are quite large compared to the
average values. The standard deviations in the change
of the methane translational energy and in the change
of methane rotational and vibrational kinetic energy in-
crease more than the standard deviation in the change of
methane total energy, when the initial translational en-
ergy is increased. We ﬁnd again an identical relation if
we plot the standard deviations versus the initial normal
energy component of the scattering at diﬀerent incidence
angles. The standard deviations are much smaller in the
parallel than in the normal component of the transla-
tional energy, so again only the normal component of the
translational energy is important. Although the stan-
dard deviations in the translational energy is smaller at
larger incidence angles than at smaller incidence angles,
we see in Fig. 1 that the spread in the angle distribution

An increase of surface temperature gives a small re-
duction of average translational energy loss (around 5
% from 200K to 800K at 96 kJ/mol normal incidence).
This is the reason why we do not observe a large shift
of the peak position of the scattering angle distribution.
However, an increase of surface temperature does have
a larger eﬀect on the average energy transfer to the sur-
face, but this is in part compensated through a decrease
of energy transfer to rotational energy.

Figure 4 shows the standard deviations in the energy
change of the translational energy, the methane total en-
ergy, and the methane rotational and vibrational kinetic
energy as a function of the surface temperature. We ob-
serve that the standard deviation in the change of rota-
tional and vibrational kinetic energy hardly changes at
increasing surface temperature. At a low surface tem-
perature it is much higher than the standard deviation
in the change of the methane total energy. So the base-
line broadening of translational energy is caused by the
transfer of translational to rotational motion. The stan-
dard deviation in the change of the methane total energy
increases much at higher surface temperature. This re-
sults also in an increase of the standard deviation in the
change of translational energy, which means that the sur-
face temperature inﬂuences the energy transfer process
between translational and surface motion. The spread in
the change of translational energy is related to the spread
in the scattering angle distributions. It is now clear that
the observed broadening of the scattering angle distribu-
tion with increasing surface temperature is really caused
by a thermal roughening process.

3. Nozzle temperature

Figure 5 shows the dependency of the standard de-

zle temperature has relative little inﬂuence on the stan-
dard deviations in the diﬀerent energy changes. There-
fore we observe almost no peak broadening in the scat-
tering angle distribution due to the nozzle temperature.
The nozzle temperature has also no inﬂuence on the av-
erage change of rotational and vibrational kinetic energy,
which means that this part of the energy transfer process
is driven primarily by normal incidence translational en-
ergy.

We have to keep in mind that we only studied the
rotational heating by the nozzle temperature, and that
we did not take vibrational excitation by nozzle heating
into account. From our wave packet simulations we know

1. Scattering angles and the Hard Cube Model

The angular dependnece of scattered intensity for a
ﬁxed total scattering angle has only been measured at
Pt(111).26,27 The measurement has been compared with
the predictions of the Hard Cube Model (HCM) as de-
scribed in Ref. 31. There seems to be more or less
agreement for low translational energies under an angle
around 45◦ with the surface, but is anomalous at a trans-
lational energy of 55 kJ/mol. The anomalous behaviour
has been explained by altering the inelastic collision dy-
namics through intermediate methyl fragments.

Although our simulations are for Ni(111) instead of
Pt(111) and we calculate real angular distributions, we
will show now that the HCM is insuﬃcient for describing
the processes involved with the scattering of methane in
our simulation. The HCM neglects the energy transfer
to rotational excitations, and overestimates the energy
transfer to the surface. This is not surprising, because
the HCM is constructed as a simple classical model for
the scattering of gas atoms from a solid surface. The
basic assumptions are that (1) the interaction of the gas
atom with a surface atom is represented by an impulsive
force of repulsion, (2) the gas-surface intermolecular po-
tential is uniform in the plane of the surface, (3) the sur-
face is represented by a set of independent particles con-
ﬁned by square well potentials, (4) the surface particles
have a Maxwellian velocity distribution.31 Assumption 1
excludes inelastic rotational scattering, because the gas
particle is an atom without moment of inertia. So the
HCM misses a large part of inelastic scattering. How-
ever, it still predicts scattering angles much more below
the incidence angles than we found from our simulation.
For example: The HCM predicts an average scattering
angle with the surface normal of 64◦ from Ni(111), at an
incidence angle of 45◦ at a surface temperature four times
lower than the gas temperature. This is much more than
for Pt(111), because the mass ratio between the gas par-
ticle and the surface atom is higher for Ni(111). There
are several explanations for this error. First, the assump-
tion 3 is unreasonable for atomic surfaces with low atom
weight, because the surface atoms are strongly bound to
each other. This means that eﬀectively the surface has
a higher mass than assumed.38 Second, there is no one-
on-one interaction between surface atom and methane
molecule, but multiple hydrogen atoms interacting with
diﬀerent Ni atoms. Third, the methane molecule is not
rigid in contrast to assumption 1. We have followed the
energy distribution during the simulation for some tra-
jectories and ﬁnd that the methane molecule adsorbs ini-

tial rotational and translational energy as vibrational en-
ergy in its bonds and bond angles when close the surface,
which is returned after the methane moves away from it.
It would be nice to test our model with molecular beam
experiment of the scattering angles on surfaces with rel-
atively low atom weight, which also try to look at rota-
tional inelastic scattering.

2. Wave packet simulations

Let us now compare the full classical dynamics with
our ﬁxed oriented wave packet simulations,21–23 because
this was initial the reason to perform the classical dynam-
ics simulations. Again we observe very little vibrational
inelastic scattering. This is in agreement with the obser-
vations in the time-of-ﬂight experiments on Pt(111).28,29
Since we used our wave packet simulations to deduce
consequences for the dissociation of methane, we have to
wonder whether the observed inelastic scattering in our
classical simulations changes the picture of the dissoci-
ation in our previous publications. Therefore we have
to look at what happens at the surface. We did so by
following some trajectories in time.

We ﬁnd approximately the same energy rearrange-
ments for the classical simulations as discussed for the
wave packet simulations for the vibrational groundstate
in Refs. 22 and 23. Again most of the normal transla-
tional energy is transfered to the potential energy terms
of the surface repulsion [see Eq. 1]. This repulsive poten-
tial energy was only given back to translational energy
in the wave packet simulations, because the orientations
and surface were ﬁxed. For the classical trajectory sim-
ulations presented in this article, the repulsive potential
energy is transfered to translational, rotational, and sur-
face energy through the inherent force of the repulsive
energy terms. We observe almost no energy transfers to
translational energy parallel to the surface, so exclusion
of these translational coordinates in the wave packet sim-
ulations do not eﬀect our deduction on the dissociation.
The energy transfers to the rotational and surface en-
ergy during the collision make it harder for the molecule
to approach the surface. This will have a quantitative
eﬀect on the eﬀective bond lengthening near the surface,
but not a qualitative.

The remaining problem deals with the eﬀect of rota-
tional motion on the dissociation probability and steer-
ing. Our ﬁrst intension was to look for the favourable
orientation at the surface, but from following some tra-
jectories it is clear that steering does not seem to occur.
There is always some rotational motion, and the molecule
leaves the surface often with another hydrogen pointing
towards to surface than when it approaches the surface.
This indicates that multiple bonds have a chance to dis-
sociate during one collision. However, it will be very
speculative to draw more conclusion on the dissociation
of methane based on the scattering in these classical tra-

jectory simulations. Classical trajectory simulation with
an extension of our potentials with an exit channel for
dissociation can possibly learn us more.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

We have performed classical dynamics simulations of
the rotational vibrational scattering of non-rigid methane
from a corrugated Ni(111) surface. Energy dissipation
and scattering angles have been studied as a function of
the translational kinetic energy, the incidence angle, the
(rotational) nozzle temperature, and the surface temper-
ature.

We ﬁnd the peak of the scattering angle distribution
somewhat below the incidence angle of 30◦, 45◦, and 60◦
at a translational energy of 96 kJ/mol. This is caused by
an average energy loss in the normal component of the
translational energy. An increase of initial normal trans-
lational energy gives an enhancement of inelastic scat-
tering. The energy loss is transfered for somewhat more
than half to the surface and the rest mostly to rotational
motion. The vibrational scattering is almost completely
elastic.

The broadening of the scattering angle distribution is
mainly caused by the energy transfer process of transla-
tional energy to rotational energy. Heating of the noz-
zle temperature gives no peak broadening. Heating of
the surface temperature gives an extra peak broadening
through thermal roughening of the surface.

The Hard Cube Model seems to be insuﬃcient for de-
scribing the scattering angles of methane from Ni(111),
if we compare its assumptions with the processes found
in our simulations.

Unimolecular evaporation in rotating, non-spherical atomic clusters is investigated using Phase
Space Theory in its orbiting transition state version. The distributions of the total kinetic energy
release εtr and the rotational angular momentum Jr are calculated for oblate top and prolate top
main products with an arbitrary degree of deformation. The orientation of the angular momentum of
the product cluster with respect to the cluster symmetry axis has also been obtained. This statistical
approach is tested in the case of the small 8-atom Lennard-Jones cluster, for which comparison with
extensive molecular dynamics simulations is presented. The role of the cluster shape has been
systematically studied for larger, model clusters in the harmonic approximation for the vibrational
densities of states. We ﬁnd that the type of deformation (prolate vs. oblate) plays little role on
the distributions and averages of εtr and Jr except at low initial angular momentum. However,
alignment eﬀects between the product angular momentum and the symmetry axis are found to be
signiﬁcant, and maximum at some degree of oblateness. The eﬀects of deformation on the rotational
cooling and heating eﬀects are also illustrated.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Statistical theories of unimolecular dissociation1,2 provide invaluable information about binding energies, lifetimes,
and more generally the thermodynamical state of atomic and molecular clusters.3 Besides their common use in helping
to interpret experiments,4,5 their quantitative relevance has been demonstrated in numerical simulations6,7 with great
accuracy. Among them, the phase space theory (PST) of Nikitin,8 Light and coworkers,9 Klots,10 and Chesnavich
and Bowers11 stands out as the most successful6,7 in describing evaporation of weakly bound clusters for which the
loose transition state hypothesis is satisﬁed. Within the PST formalism, statistical dissociation is characterized by the
vibrational densities of states (VDOS) of the parent and product clusters, as well as the rotational density (RDOS)
of the products. This latter quantity depends on the interaction between the fragments, and more importantly on
their shapes,11 at least through their number of rotational degrees of freedom.10

Large clusters of simple materials, such as rare gases or alkali metals, are usually found to be rather spherical. Small
aggregates can nevertheless exhibit signiﬁcant deformations at the scale of a few tens of atoms or molecules. The shape
of covalent clusters could be inferred from the ion mobility measurements performed by the Jarrold group.12,13,14 In
silicon clusters, a prolate-oblate transition was evidenced around 20 atoms.12 Small carbon clusters show a competition
between linear chains, rings and planar shapes.13 Larger carbon clusters can be arbitrarily prolate under the nanotube
geometry. Deformed metal clusters have been investigated theoretically using various approaches,15 especially in
concern with the ﬁssion problem.16

Accounting for deviations from the spherical shape may be crucial for calculating precisely the number of rovibra-
tional states of small molecules, and the role of nonsphericity on the statistical observables relevant to unimolecular
dissociation has been discussed previously. Chesnavich and Bowers11,18 quantiﬁed the error introduced in the ro-
tational DOS when approximating symmetric rigid rotors by spherical tops, for small molecules or radicals with
moderate deformations. Berblinger and Schlier17 used a Monte Carlo integration method to compute the density of
quantum states of the oblate molecules H+

2 using appropriate densities or rotational states.

Peslherbe and Hase considered evaporation in small aluminium clusters from the point of view of molecular dynamics
(MD) simulations and PST.7 In this work, deformation eﬀects were not fully accounted for, because the centrifugal
barrier was neglected except in the spherical top approximation for the fragments. However it is known that centrifugal
forces, and more generally rotation may aﬀect cluster properties quite signiﬁcantly.19,20,21

In our previous work, an extensive study of evaporation in rotating atomic and molecular clusters was carried
out,22,23,24 paying a special attention to the ﬁnal angular momentum and kinetic energy released. By carefully
calculating the vibrational and rotational DOS’s pertaining to various cases of spherical clusters emitting atoms,22,23
linear or spherical molecules,24 we could extend the conclusion of Weerasinghe and Amar6 that PST is quantitative
in reproducing the exact numerical results. However some clear deviations could be seen in the statistical treatment
of evaporation when applied to the smaller cluster LJ8, where the main product LJ7 was approximated as a spherical
top. This poorly satisfactory result was attributed to the non-spherical character of LJ7, known to be oblate in its
most stable energy structure.

Our ﬁrst goal in this paper is to incorporate the eﬀects of deformations in the PST treatment for rotating clusters. As
a ﬁrst application, atomic dissociation in LJ8 will be considered as an example. More generally, we will focus on large
clusters simpliﬁed as molten, homogeneous droplets, in order to investigate the role of nonsphericity on the observables
relevant to cluster dissociation. Following previous eﬀort,6,7,24,25 it is hoped that cluster evaporation could be used as
a probe of the shape, and possibly the phase changes, in the main product. The dynamical simulation of fragmentation
in asymetric molecules such as those aforementioned involve can be very challenging from a computational point of
view. Therefore it is important to incorporate and quantify the eﬀects of deformation in the rate theories used to
interpret gas-phase experiments on clusters.

In the next Section, we summarize the theoretical results of phase space theory in the approximation where the
main product after atom dissociation can be modelled as a prolate or oblate top. Concise expressions for the rotational
densities of states, KER and ﬁnal angular momentum are proposed. We also compute the distribution of the relative
orientation between the symmetry axis and the angular momentum in the product. This property, along with its
average value, provide an estimation of how the rotational energy is distributed in the cluster. We illustrate the speciﬁc
case of LJ8 and larger LJ clusters in Sec. III. In particular, the roles of size, total energy and angular momentum on
the ﬁnal properties are discussed. Finally, we summarize and give some concluding remarks in Sec. IV.

II. METHODS

A. Phase Space Theory

The rotational density of states (RDOS) is a key function within the framework of phase space theory.8,9,10,11 This
quantity depends on the kinetic energy released after dissociation, εtr, sum of the translational and rotational parts. It
also depends on the total angular momentum J. It is obtained by integration of the rotational sum of states Γ(ε∗
r, Jr),
which quantiﬁes the number of rotational states available at a given angular momentum Jr of the product cluster,
r, its limiting value at the centrifugal barrier.11
and a kinetic energy lower than ε∗

In PST the two fragments are treated as rigid bodies and the expressions of Γ only depend on their corresponding
symmetries. Our present interest concerns the evaporation from nonspherical atomic clusters, and we have chosen to
deal with symmetric top deformations, prolate or oblate, but with an arbitrary degree of nonsphericity. The rotational

One motivation of the present work is to investigate the possible correlations between the cylindrical symmetry
axis of the main product cluster and the angular momentum vector after fragmentation. Therefore the most general
statistical quantity we need to consider is the probability for a dissociation event to occur with prescribed values of

To obtain the rotational densities of states at given εtr and J, the sums of rotational states must be integrated in
the whole range
of available values of Jr and L, accounting for conservation of total energy and angular momentum.
The general schematic integration plot is represented in Fig. 1(a). Here X and Y are the two rotational constants
of the product, such that X > Y , equal to A and B (resp. B and C) in the prolate top (resp. oblate top) case.
The barrier height corresponding to orbital momentum L is denoted as ε†(L) in what follows. The procedure used to
calculate the RDOS at ﬁnite angular momentum is basically the same as used previously by Chesnavich and Bowers,11

The rotational sums of states, Eqn. (2) and (3), can be gathered into Γ(ε∗

valid for both types of deformations. These distributions, as well as the preceding probabilities of εtr or Jr, must be
calculated numerically in general. Ingredients other than the rotational densities, most importantly the vibrational
densities of states and the centrifugal energies ε†(L), are obtained from the same techniques described in our previous
work.22

(cid:3)

However, the general shape of the distributions can be inferred already at this stage. In the prolate top situation,
B and P (cos θ) is maximal when cos θ = 0, and minimal when cos θ = 1. The reverse holds for the oblate
Bs ≥
top case. Therefore, P (cos θ) is a decreasing (resp. increasing) function of cos θ for prolate (resp. oblate) fragments.
This means that the angular momentum gets more likely aligned with the principal axis with largest inertia. Thus it
simply reﬂects the greater rotational stability of rigid bodies when their angular velocity is lower.28

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The clusters we are interested in are Lennard-Jones clusters characterized by an arbitrary degree of deformation.
The simplest model is that of an ellipsoid, whose axes ratio can take any real value. At a given (large) number of
constituants n, the reasonable assumption of constant density implies that the volume of the cluster is constant, which
allows us to deﬁne the equivalent spherical radius Rs as Rs = R0n1/3, where R0 plays the role of a lattice parameter.
In practice, R0 is taken to reproduce the rotational constant of the icosahedral 13-atom cluster.

The ellipsoidal shape of the cluster is continuously varied by keeping its volume constant. By denoting a and b the
long parallel and short perpendicular axes of the ellipsoid, respectively, we quantify deformation in the cluster using
γ = (b

a)/(b + a). Equating R3

s to ab2 yields

As the cluster becomes increasingly prolate, γ decreases and tends to
1, which corresponds to a linear system. For
oblate systems, γ increases toward +1, which corresponds to a planar system. The rotational constants corresponding

A. LJ8−→ LJ7+LJ

6

The dissociation of LJ8 has been considered ﬁrst since it provides a good candidate to test the proposed formalism,
the product cluster LJ7 being not perfectly spherical in its ground state geometry. For this system, the anharmonic
VDOS and the eﬀective dissociation potential were obtained from parallel tempering Monte Carlo and Wang-Landau
simulations, respectively. The technical details can be found in our previous work.22

To quantify the real extent of deformation in the vibrationally excited LJ7 cluster, we have analysed the thermal
evolution of its rotational constants. In Fig 2 the average constants are plotted versus T . At T =0, the minimum
energy conﬁguration is the pentagonal bipyramid, an exactly oblate system for which A = B
0.11. These
rotational constants yield a deformation index γ
0.3, or a/Rs = 0.7 with Rs = 0.55. At higher temperatures,
the cluster deviates more and more from the oblate shape, eventually becoming prolate. In order to get meaningful
statistics of the dissociation process using standard molecular dynamics, we had to thermalize the parent cluster at
0.2). The rotational constants used in the PST
rather high temperatures, typically above the melting point (T
analysis were taken at this precise temperature, yielding A
0.11 LJ units. These values give an
equivalent deformation index γ =
0.3 in the ellipsoidal picture, or a/Rs = 1.5. Interestingly, the double icosahedron

LJ19 is more spherical than LJ7 (γ

0.18), and remains so even above its melting temperature.

to Eqn. (14–19), which arise due to the new restraint on the orbital momentum, namely L =

and

Under these aforementioned conditions, increasing cluster deformation (γ < 0 or γ > 0) mainly increases the
product angular momentum, and marginally reduces the KER. The prolate top approximation performs signiﬁcantly
better than the simple spherical assumption in reproducing the MD results, but this is also true for the oblate top
approximation.

−

≈ −

The complete distribution of Jr contains more information than the average value alone. This distribution is
plotted in Fig. 3 for the initial angular momentum J = 3. A good agreement between MD and PST is obtained
when the deformation of the product cluster is taken into account. By comparison, the distribution in the spherical
approximation underestimates Jr. More interestingly, the PST/oblate calculation looks very close to the prolate result,
suggesting that the type of deformation does not alter signiﬁcantly the rotational distribution after evaporation. The
KER distribution, not plotted here, shows a similar behavior. However, it should be kept in mind here that we are
dealing with only moderate deviations from sphericity.

More insight is gained from the distribution of cos θ, represented in Fig. 4 for the same conditions of total energy
and angular momentum. The distribution is obviously uniform in the spherical case, as there is no privileged axis.
As expected from our previous analysis, the prolate description of the product cluster favors low cos θ. This is in
agreement with MD, but diﬀers from the PST result in the oblate approximation.

Increasing angular momentum in the parent cluster brings the ﬁnal rotation axis closer to the major principal axis,
as shown in Fig. 5. This emphasizes the need for properly describing deformations in clusters having a signiﬁcant or
even moderate rotational motion. The values of J considered in this ﬁgure are small enough to produce rotational
heating.23,26 However high angular momenta, which result in rotational cooling, also display a similar behavior.
Comparing the values of
at J = 0 and J = 3 shows that the deviation from random orientation (for which
= 1/2) is half due to the extent of deformation, and half due to angular momentum itself. From this ﬁgure,
cos θ

but also from Fig. 4, alignment between the rotation axis and the main symmetry axis is about twice more eﬃcient
for prolate tops than for oblate tops. Such an eﬀect is expected to be also magniﬁed by the extent of deformation.

B. Size eﬀects in model clusters

We now discuss the general eﬀects of deformation on the statistical properties of larger clusters after evaporation.
Our interest here is not to reproduce MD or experimental results, for this reason we have used an approximate model,
where the n-atom LJ cluster is treated as a continuous medium with constant density, and the vibrational density of
states is assumed to be harmonic. Such a model allows us to vary arbitrarily the degree of deformation γ in the whole
4n/r6, which yields a barrier energy ε† proportional
range
to L3. As deformation of the cluster increases, the physical extent of the cluster also increases and we expect the
1/r6 approximation to fail eventually. A more appropriate potential such as 1/(r
r0)6 would not be relevant for the
present, qualitative discussion, even though it would provide a more robust ground for eventual comparisons.

1 < γ < 1. The interaction potential is also simpliﬁed as

Three parent cluster sizes n+ 1 have been selected, which correspond to n = 50, 100, and 200, respectively. To cover
a vast range of situations, two total energies (E/n = 0.9 and 1.2 LJ units per atom) and two angular momenta (J = 0
and J = 20 LJ units) have been considered, thus providing four diﬀerent physical conditions for fragmentation. The

eﬀects of deformation on the kinetic energy released and on the ﬁnal angular momentum are shown in Figs. 6 and
7, respectively, for the four present situations. From a general point of view, smaller clusters show more pronounced
deviations of the average KER, product angular momentum. This is easily understood by noticing that the rotational
n−5/3)
constants, hence all the parameters which characterize the deformation such as λ, decrease with size very fast (
n−1/2). In other terms, the speciﬁc symmetric top contributions
with respect to, e.g. the centrifugal barrier energy (
γt to the RDOS become less important with increasing size.

It is useful to analyse ﬁrst the J = 0 case, since all the integrals involved are one-dimensional. For convenience, we

Γ is a linear function of εtr independently of the rotational constants, therefore the average KER does not change
with deformation, because of the normalization of the integrals involved in the average. This shows that any variation
in the average energy released is due to the centrifugal barrier only. The Klots models10 approximate the rotational
densities Γ(εtr, low J) as a power law in εtr, the exponent increasing proportionally with the number of rotational
degrees of freedom. Since this number does not depend on the possible symmetry of the products, there are no
deformation eﬀects on the evaporation statistics within the Klots model.

We have not found simple expressions for the RDOS by Taylor expanding the general formula of Eq. (23) in a,
because the result still contained complex functions of the rotational constants. Instead we consider the Jr observable.
The general expression for the probability distribution of Jr at J = 0, for prolate top product, reads23

The increase in product angular momentum, as well as the non equivalence of the two deformations close to the
spherical shape, are indeed seen in Figs. 7(a,b), and these eﬀects are also observed at nonzero initial angular momenta,

energy released decreases. This explains the correlation between
seen in Figs. 6 and 7. Larger total
energies decrease the relative importance of the rotational contribution, as well as the eﬀects of nonsphericity. This
is precisely what we observe in Figs. 6(b) and 7(b). Conversely, if now we increase J keeping the total energy ﬁxed,
more kinetic energy is allowed in the rotational modes, which usually yields ampliﬁed deviations with respect to the
spherical reference for both the KER and the product angular momentum.

At ﬁnite angular momentum J, it is much harder to provide simple explanations for the behavior of the statistical
quantities, because new parameters come to play an important role. Increasing J generally has a much more dramatic
eﬀect than increasing E. The minimum value for the KER, εmin
, has a component which grows linearly with the
smallest rotational constant of the product.11,23 At large deformations, either prolate or oblate, εmin
always takes
values smaller than for the spherical reference. Therefore low values of the KER are further statistically favored. This
eﬀect may be larger than the small increase due to the centrifugal energies seen in Fig. 6(a). Second, because high
deformations are characterized with at least one very small rotational constant, the upper limits Jr(Y ) of the product
angular momentum in the (L, Jr) integration range can reach higher values. Thus the integration range extends to
larger Jr, and the average value of

, as shown in Figs. 6 and 7. The exact numerical calculations displayed
in Figs. 6(c,d) and 7(c,d) conﬁrm that much larger deviations are seen with respect to the spherical reference when
J is nonzero. In particular, the marked decreases in the KER and the correlated increases in the product angular
momentum are of larger magnitude than for J = 0. A notable result is that the most important diﬀerences between
the two types of deformation (oblate and prolate) are exclusively seen at very low total momentum and for large sizes.
These diﬀerences are related to variations in small rotational constants. Above some speciﬁc total energy and/or some
total angular momentum, the eﬀects of prolate or oblate deformations become rather similar in shape and magnitude,
except very close to γ = 0.

Another interesting feature of these nonspherical systems is their ability to adopt a preferential direction for the
rotational excitation following evaporation, as measured with respect to the cylindrical axis. The average cosine of
the angle between the product angular momentum and the symmetry axis, as obtained from Eq. (19), is shown in
Fig. 8 for the same mechanical conditions as in Figs. 6 and 7 versus the extent of deformation γ. Again, the eﬀects
monotonically decrease with increasing cluster size.

shows the same qualitative variations with respect to γ. For oblate top products, dissociation induces rotation around
a long axis preferentially, and the eﬀect is more signiﬁcant at smaller total energies or larger initial angular momenta.
Prolate top products, on the other hand, display a non-monotonic behavior, concomitant with the variations of the
large rotational constant, Eq. (22), which has a maximum when γ = (√2
1)/(√2 + 1). The fact that alignment is
hindered at very large oblate deformations is a simple consequence that the two rotational constants B and C tend to
0, hence the second integral over L and Jr in Eq. (19) goes to 0, and the system becomes equivalent to a sphere again
from the point of view of its orientation. Therefore, it is practically impossible to reach a perfect statistical alignment
for oblately deformed systems. Such a situation is never met with prolate deformed clusters, since one rotational
constant always keeps increasing for large deformations. The shape of the curves in Figs. 8(c,d) also reveals that
alignment can be quite eﬀective, even at moderate deformations. For a 50-atom cluster, J
20 is close to the typical
thermal angular momentum near the melting point, and a deformation of about 20% is enough to induce statistical
alignment beyond 25%.

Finally, following our previous work,23 we focus on the inﬂuence of nonsphericity on the rotational cooling and
heating eﬀects. The same simple model for LJ clusters was used in the harmonic approximation for the VDOS and
the C/r6 radial potential for the dissociation energy. We consider here more realistic conditions for dissociation,
namely thermal distributions for the energy and angular momentum of the parent cluster, as well as a possible extra
energy shift to model an initial, brief excitation (from photoabsorption or collision). To provide ground for comparison,
these distributions are assumed to be Boltzmann-like and identical for all geometries. The ﬁnal distributions were
calculated by taking a full account of the prolate or oblate character of the main product cluster.

9

In spherical clusters, we have seen that a purely thermal distribution generally leads to rotational cooling, i.e. the
distribution of angular momentum of the product cluster is shifted to lower values.23 On the other hand, an initially
cold cluster submitted to a sudden vibrational excitation preferentially exhibits rotational heating.23,26 In Fig. 9 the
ﬁnal angular momentum distributions are compared for the three types of products. Even though the product clusters
are signiﬁcantly deformed, the general rotational behavior remains similar to that of the spherical top. As seen from
Fig. 9(a), purely thermal evaporation induces rotational cooling, and this eﬀect is attenuated for nonspherical clusters.
Deformation also inﬂuences the ﬁnal distribution itself, which diﬀers signiﬁcantly from the Boltzmann behavior for
prolate systems. These results are consistent with our previous analysis, as thermal evaporation corresponds more
likely to the cases (c) and (d) of Figs. 6–8 with substantial initial J. At

changes (including their magnitude) are reﬂected on the distributions in Fig. 9(a).

Rotational heating is produced in a diﬀerent way, by adding a sharp extra vibrational excitation to an initially cold
cluster. Deformed clusters also exhibit rotational heating, as shown in Fig. 9(b). For both prolate and oblate top
products, deformation further heats the ﬁnal rotational motion, but the two deformations behave dissimilarly, the
eﬀect being much stronger for the oblate top product. This is understood by considering again Fig. 7(b), which shares

IV. CONCLUSION

The present work was aimed at providing a quantitative study of the eﬀects of cluster shape on its evaporation
statistics. Within the framework of phase space theory, the distributions of kinetic energy released and ﬁnal angular
momenta were obtained assuming the fragments could be described as an atom plus a prolate or an oblate top as the
main product.

These theoretical tools were challenged on the example of the unimolecular dissociation of the 8-atom Lennard-
Jones cluster, chosen for its signiﬁcantly oblate shape. The small disagreement reported earlier22 between PST and
molecular dynamics simulations for the distribution of ﬁnal angular momentum was solved after accounting for the
nonspherical character of LJ7.

Using simple models for the vibrational density of states and the dissociation potential, we systematically investi-
gated the changes induced by deformation. We found very signiﬁcant deviations with respect to the spherical case
for both the ﬁnal angular momentum and kinetic energy, especially for nonzero initial momenta. In such cases, the
relative variations of the energetic properties are larger than those of angular momenta by up to even one order of
magnitude.

We could interpret these changes as originating partly from the speciﬁc centrifugal barrier in our present imple-
mentation of PST, but also from the new energy constraints arising with lower rotational constants. These eﬀects are
not included in simpler statistical rate theories of unimolecular dissociation such as the Klots models, not mentioning
the Engelking-Weisskopf29,30 or RRK approaches.31

We also obtained information about the relative orientation of the product angular momentum, by considering
restricted integration of the rotational densities of states. Alignment toward the long axes is generally observed for
all deformations, in agreement with mechanical arguments. This alignment was seen to be very eﬀﬁcient already at
moderate initial angular momenta, and for moderate deformations.

Finally, we discussed the inﬂuence of deformation on the rotational cooling and heating eﬀects resulting from speciﬁc
excitations. While cooling is attenuated for nonspherical clusters, heating is ampliﬁed. These behaviors are attributed
to the decrease of one rotational constant, which favors larger angular momenta in the product cluster.

The examples considered here were obtained on model clusters, but we expect the present results to be relevant
for more realistic systems. Charged rare-gas clusters, which display very prolate shapes below 15 atoms due to the
presence of a linear ionic trimer, have been the subject of intense experimental and theoretical activity from the point
of view of their dissociation patterns.27

Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules are strongly oblate and their rotation was considered within the
astrophysical context by Rouan and co-workers.32 Dehydrogenation of these molecules, in particular, has received a
special attention among several experimental and theoretical groups.33,34,35 This problem could be investigated with
the same methods used here.

In these two examples, a realistic atomistic description requires models much more involved than simple pairwise
potentials. This practical limitation prevents one fully relying on brute-force simulations, thus making statistical
approaches most useful in the future.

An improved method of moving the parameters in variational quantum Monte Carlo (VMC) cal-
culations is described, and then applied to the calculation of atomic forces for ﬁrst-row hydrides. We
propose use of Newton’s method with singular-value decomposition (SVD) to update the variational
parameters, combined with steepest descent (SD) updates along directions rejected by the SVD. Us-
ing this approach to minimize the energy expectation value, we compute atomic forces [J. Chem.
Phys. 118, 7193 (2003)] for ﬁrst-row monohydrides in VMC and ﬁxed-node diﬀusion Monte Carlo
(DMC). The forces agree quantitatively with potential-energy surfaces, demonstrating the accuracy
of this force procedure. Properties obtained from these calculations, such as harmonic vibrational
frequencies and anharmonicity constants, agree well with experimental values.

INTRODUCTION

II. THEORETICAL BACKGROUND AND
COMPUTATIONAL DETAILS

Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) is an eﬀective method
for solving time-independent Schr¨odinger equation, and
has become quite successful in computing ground-state
total energies. The QMC method gives energies of atoms,
molecules, and solids that are comparably accurate or
more accurate than traditional techniques such as den-
sity functional theory (DFT), multiconﬁguration self-
consistent ﬁeld (MCSCF), or coupled cluster methods.
Although the situation for the calculation of properties
other than energies has been less favorable, the accu-
rate QMC calculation of atomic forces has been enabled
through the recent developments made in this area by
Assaraf and Caﬀarel [1, 2, 3], Filippi and Umrigar [4],
Casalegno, Mella, and Rappe [5], Chiesa, Ceperley, and
Zhang [6], and others.

In this paper, we describe an improved algorithm for
optimizing VMC wave functions. As in our previous pa-
per [7], the ﬁrst and second derivatives of the variational
energy are analytically computed, and used to perform
Newton’s method parameter updates with SVD. We now
propose augmenting this approach by using the steepest
descent (SD) method in the subspace neglected by the
Newton’s method SVD. The improved algorithm was ap-
plied to the calculation of the ground-state energies of the
ﬁrst-row hydrides. In general, the direct application of
the variational principle yields signiﬁcantly lower energy
than variance minimization methods, so minimizing the
energy is advantageous. The wave functions optimized
in VMC were used in DMC as a guiding function to get
even more accurate energy.

In our previous work on the atomic forces [5], the cal-
culations of H2 and LiH molecules were carried out. To
demonstrate the wider applicability of the method, we
performed the force calculation of ﬁrst-row hydrides from
LiH through HF in this paper. The additional cost for
the force calculation was small in all cases.

The variational parameters used in VMC, which are
often called Jastrow parameters, will be denoted as c1,
c2, . . ., cn, here. The VMC energy expectation value,
ET , is a function of these Jastrow parameters, and the
parameter set that minimizes ET is sought.

The SD method is useful in the initial stages of param-
eter optimization in VMC, due to the large error bars of
Hessian matrix components. One arbitrary constant is
necessary to implement the SD method. We used the
following two-step scheme to ﬁnd a good SD constant.

Let Q0 and Q be the vectors composed of Jastrow

parameters before and after update, respectively:

Q0 = (cid:0)c1,0 c2,0 · · ·
Q = (cid:0)c1 c2 · · ·

,

T
cn,0(cid:1)
T
cn(cid:1)
.

And let g be the gradient vector of energy with respect
to the variational parameters:

T
gn(cid:1)

g = (cid:0)g1 g2 · · ·

= (cid:0)
In the ﬁrst update, a value, a(0), is chosen as a SD con-
stant, which is small enough not to exhaust the downhill
direction.

After the ﬁrst update, VMC simulation is performed
again to get the gradient at the new parameter set, Q. If
we consider only the i-th component, the best value for
the new SD constant, a(1)
, will make the gradient com-
ponent, gi, zero in the next simulation, and will be given
by the following equation:

Although a(1)
values are diﬀerent from component to
component, it is usually the case that they are quite sim-
ilar. So the averaged value was used for the next update:

.

These two steps of parameter updates using SD reduce
the energy enough to greatly reduce the error bars, en-
abling the Newton’s method.

If we let H represent the Hessian matrix, the parame-

ters can be updated according to Newton’s method.

Q = Q0 −

H−1(Q0)g(Q0).

Since H(Q0) and g(Q0) are calculated in the VMC sim-
ulation, we must invert H(Q0) for the Newton’s method
update of the parameters.

It is well-known that any matrix, e.g., H, can be ex-

pressed as

where

H = U [diag(wj )] VT ,

where wj ≥
matrix, the inverse matrix can be obtained by

0 and U, V are orthogonal [8]. For a square

H−1 = V [diag(1/wj)] UT .

Very small values of wj lead to erroneous moves along
the directions corresponding to these components due to
large 1/wj terms. For that reason, if wj is less than a
certain threshold value, 1/wj is set to 0 in the actual
calculation (SVD).

We used SVD method for the inversion of Hessian ma-
trix in many cases and it consistently gives robust results.
However, the SVD method, by zeroing out small wj val-
ues, is equivalent to abandoning the corresponding search
directions, the use of which may give better result. So we
propose a modiﬁed algorithm in which the SD method is
added for components discarded in the SVD method.

If we let U and V be equal to the square matrix whose
column vectors are the normalized eigenvectors of H,
will be the eigenvalues of H. For values of wj that
wj}
{
are smaller than the threshold, 1/wj can be replaced by
a constant, a, instead of zero, which can be considered to
be equivalent to the SD method along the corresponding
directions. This method makes it possible to use the in-
formation for all directions, some of which are discarded
in SVD method, and it can be beneﬁcial in cases where
some eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix become close to
zero, due to the noise inherent in QMC.

To construct the trial wave functions used in VMC, the
following method was used. First, a contracted Gaussian-
type function (CGTF) was ﬁtted to each Slater-type or-
bital (STO). Ten primitive Gaussians were used for 1s,
eight for 2s or 2p, and six for 3s, 3p, or 3d type STOs.
The orbital exponents of STOs in the work of Cade and
Huo [9] were adopted (excluding the f -type orbitals).
Each ﬁrst-row atom has 29 STOs centered on it (1s, 1s′,
2s, 2s′, 3s, three 2p’s, three 2p′’s, three 2p′′’s, three 3p’s,
six 3d’s, and six 3d′’s for Li, and 1s, 1s′, 2s, 2s′, 3s, three

2p’s, three 2p′’s, three 2p′′’s, three 2p′′′’s, six 3d’s, and
six 3d′’s for other ﬁrst-row atoms) and hydrogen atom
has 6 STOs centered on it (1s, 1s′, 2s, and three 2p’s) as
a basis set.

Each molecular orbital (MO) was expressed as a lin-
ear combination of STOs, the coeﬃcients of which were
obtained using the Hartree-Fock method in Gaussian 98
(G98) [10]. For the open shell molecules, restricted open
shell Hartree-Fock (ROHF) wave functions were used.
The MOs from G98 were used to construct the Slater
determinants for α and β electrons. The product of two
determinants was multiplied by a positive correlation fac-
tor to form a trial wave function [11, 12]:

In this equation, a and i, j refer to the nuclei and the

br). We used b = 1 a−1
and included 30 terms, namely,
4 electron-electron, 6 electron-nucleus, and 20 electron-
electron-nucleus terms.

Five diﬀerent bond distances around the experimental
bond length were used for calculation, namely 90%, 95%,
100%, 105% and 110% of the experimental bond length,
rexp. 2000 walkers were used for all the calculations in
this paper. In updating Jastrow parameters, average over
100 blocks was made typically, where each block was the
average over 100 steps. To accelerate the sampling, a
Fokker-Planck type equation was used [13].

After a short initial simulation without Jastrow fac-
tor, the Hartree-Fock wave function was multiplied by
the Jastrow factor with all parameters set to zero. The
gradient and Hessian of energy with respect to the Jas-
trow parameters were computed in the VMC simulation
after this step. Using the gradient and Hessian informa-
tion, a new Jastrow parameter set is calculated, and a
new VMC simulation is performed with this updated pa-
rameter set. This process was iterated until the energy
converged. Fully optimized parameters were obtained by
10-15 iterations. One iteration took about 30 minutes for
LiH and about 90 minutes for HF when a single 2.8 GHz
Intel r(cid:13) Xeon

Processor was used.

After optimizing the trial wave function using VMC,
a ﬁxed-node DMC calculation was performed using im-
portance sampling, as proposed by Reynolds, Ceperley,
Alder, and Lester [14]. The DMC time step was 0.005 a.u.
A similar DMC method was used by L¨uchow and Ander-
son [15, 16] in their calculation of ﬁrst-row hydrides.

Force calculations were performed in both VMC and
DMC. We followed the method described previously [5].
If the wave function were exact, the exact force would be
given by the Hellmann-Feynman theorem (HFT). Since

the trial wave function, ΨT , is not exact, terms that can-
cel in case of exact wave functions should be considered,
in addition to the HFT expression. Retaining terms in-

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The energies of ﬁrst-row monohydrides at various bond
distances were calculated. The plot of energy versus bond
distance for hydrogen ﬂuoride (HF) is shown in Figure 1.
In obtaining each point, 1000 blocks, each of which was
composed of 100 steps, were used with optimized Jastrow
parameters. The plots for other molecules are similar to
that for HF. The energy obtained from VMC is much
lower than the Hartree-Fock energy obtained from G98,
so that the Hartree-Fock result is not shown. It can be
seen from Table I that the DMC energy is much lower
than the VMC energy and is close to the experimental
value.

DMC calculations reproduce the experimental ener-
gies of lighter ﬁrst-row hydrides very well, while giving
slightly higher energies than experiment in the case of

heavier ﬁrst-row hydrides. This may be due to the ap-
proximations used in DMC calculations: ﬁxed node ap-
proximation, neglect of the relativistic eﬀect, and the
error related with ﬁnite time step. To estimate the
time step error in DMC calculation, DMC calculation at
rexp with several diﬀerent time step values ranging from
0.0001 to 0.005 a.u. were carried out. All energies ob-
tained for ﬁrst-row hydrides agreed within 2-3 mHartree.
The data points of energy versus bond distance ob-
tained from VMC and DMC were ﬁtted to parabolas to
estimate the minimum energy (E0), the equilibrium bond
length (re), and the harmonic vibrational frequency (ωe).
The calculated values of E0, re, and ωe for all ﬁrst-row
monohydride molecules are summarized in Table I, along
with the experimental data [18]. The experimental en-
ergies are corrected by adding zero point energies. Our
calculations agreed well with the experimental results.

Each total energy data point has an error bar asso-
ciated with it, so we follow a simple procedure to esti-
mate how the energy error bars calculated translate into
uncertainty in other quantities such as equilibrium bond
length and harmonic vibrational frequency. A large set of
synthetic data points were stochastically generated, such
that the average energy value at each bond length agrees
with that obtained from QMC with the standard devia-
tion the same as the energy error bar given by the QMC
calculation. By computing the averages and standard
deviations of the lowest energy (E0), equilibrium bond
length (re), and the harmonic vibrational frequency (ωe)
for the synthetic data sets, the error bars of E0, re, and
ωe can be estimated. The error bars of the last digit thus
calculated are shown in parentheses. While estimated er-
ror bars of E0 and re are quite small, the error bars of
ωe are large, since ωe depends sensitively on the shape of
the potential energy surface.

Forces were computed for each monohydride and each
bond length in VMC and DMC. The force result for HF
is shown in Figure 1, where the slopes of the line seg-
ments superimposed on the energy result correspond to

of the parabola and from the direct calculation for HF
are shown in Table II.

The magnitude of the force at 90% rexp is larger than
the slope of the parabola, while the force at 110% rexp is
smaller than the parabola tangent, which clearly shows
the deviation of the calculated force from harmonic be-
havior. The approximate shape of the anharmonic po-
tential can be described by the Morse potential [19]:

unit of cm−1 and other constants are in SI units. Using
these equations, the anharmonicity constant, ωexe can
be calculated, and the results are tabulated in Table III
along with the experimental value [18]. The error bars of
the anharmonicity constants were calculated using syn-
thetic data points generated by a simulation similar to
that for the energy. The anharmonicity calculated with
this method agrees very well with the experimental data.
In the VMC calculation of HF, the Jastrow parameter
set at rexp was optimized ﬁrst, and after the optimization
at this distance, the bond distance is changed, and the
MO coeﬃcients corresponding to this bond distance are
introduced. Then, the Jastrow parameters were reopti-
mized at this new bond distance. This method makes
it possible to reduce the CPU time for the calculation at
other bond distances once the parameter set is optimized
at one bond distance. This approach is eﬀective because
the Jastrow parameter sets at diﬀerent bond distances
can be quite similar, as measured by the cosine similar-
ity [20] between Jastrow parameter sets summarized in
Table IV. The cosine similarity is deﬁned as

cos θ =

Qm ·
Qn
Qm√Qn ·

,

Qn

√Qm ·

(18)

and it is close to unity if two vectors are similar. This
is certainly the case for Jastrow parameter sets of HF
at various bond distances. This seems to be useful for
the molecular dynamics (MD) simulation coupled with
QMC, proposed by Mitas and Grossman [21]. On the
other hand, in case of CH, NH, or OH, it was problem-
atic to apply this approach and we had to optimize the
parameters from the beginning for all bond distances.
The cosine similarity values in case of CH are shown in
Table IV, when the parameters are optimized separately
from scratch for all bond distances. If the parameters of
HF at each bond distance are optimized from scratch, the
cosine similarity values are around 0.9 for parameter sets
optimized at diﬀerent bond distances, and similar ener-
gies can be obtained with diﬀerent sets of parameters.

The energy of BH at rexp at various stages of parame-
ter optimization is shown in Figure 2. If the SD method
is used for initial stages of parameter optimization (B),
Newton’s method with SVD converges to the lowest en-
ergy after several steps. If the initial SD method is not
used (A), Newton’s method is somewhat diﬃcult to apply
due to the large values of Hessian error bar components.
In this case, it was necessary to calculate for long period
of time and to set the threshold for SVD somewhat high.
Within this approach, the SVD alone does not yield fully
optimized energy. The simultaneous application of New-

ton’s method and SD (steps 6-9) was very useful in this
case for more thorough minimization.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

The energy minimization method in VMC is useful,
but it requires an eﬀective optimization scheme. The
addition of steepest descents to the subspace neglected by
Newton’s method with SVD seems to be advantageous for
the molecular systems we investigated. The calculation
of the energies with QMC resulted in accurate harmonic
vibrational frequencies of diatomic molecules.

The force calculation method combining energy min-
imization, Pulay’s corrections, and a renormalized
Hellmann-Feynman estimator worked very well with all
the ﬁrst-row hydride molecules with small extra eﬀort.
This force calculation method gave accurate anharmonic-
ity constants while energy calculations alone (from 90%
to 110% rexp) were not suﬃcient to provide anharmonic-
ities.

We present a new dimensional scaling transformation of the Schr¨odinger equation for the two elec-
tron bond. This yields, for the ﬁrst time, a good description of the two electron bond via D-scaling.
There also emerges, in the large-D limit, an intuitively appealing semiclassical picture, akin to a
molecular model proposed by Niels Bohr in 1913. In this limit, the electrons are conﬁned to speciﬁc
orbits in the scaled space, yet the uncertainty principle is maintained because the scaling leaves in-
variant the position-momentum commutator. A ﬁrst-order perturbation correction, proportional to
1/D, substantially improves the agreement with the exact ground state potential energy curve. The
present treatment is very simple mathematically, yet provides a strikingly accurate description of the
potential energy curves for the lowest singlet, triplet and excited states of H2. We ﬁnd the modiﬁed
D-scaling method also gives good results for other molecules. It can be combined advantageously
with Hartree-Fock and other conventional methods.

Quantum chemistry has achieved excellent agreement
between theory and experiment, even for large molecules,
by using computational power to overcome the diﬃculty
of treating electron-electron interactions [1, 2, 3, 4]. Here
we present a new version of an unconventional method
to treat electronic structure [5, 6, 7, 8]. This emulates an
approach developed in quantum chromodynamics [9], by
generalizing the Schr¨odinger equation to D dimensions
and rescaling coordinates [7].

Early work found the tutorial D-scaling procedure of
Witten [9] can be dramatically improved; the ground
state energy of He was obtained accurate to 5 signiﬁcant
ﬁgures by interpolation between the D = 1 and D
→ ∞
limits [5], and to 9 ﬁgures by a perturbation expansion in
1/D [10]. However, the scaling procedure which worked
well for atoms [5, 6] did not prove successful for two-
center problems [7, 8]; e.g., for H2 that procedure did
not yield a bound ground state, (see our Fig. 3).

In our present approach, the large-D limit makes con-
tact with the Bohr model of the H2 molecule [11].
In
this way we obtain, for the ﬁrst time, a link between pre-
and post-quantum mechanical descriptions of the chemi-
cal bond (Bohr-Sommerfeld vs Heisenberg-Schr¨odinger).
Marked improvement is achieved by including the lead-
ing correction term in 1/D and a rudimentary adjust-
ment of the D-scaling. Fig. 1 shows potential energy
curves for H2 obtained with our simple approach. Dots
comprise a synthesis of experimental data and computa-
tions employing many terms in variational wavefunctions
[12]. Our simple method gives surprisingly accurate re-
sults and holds promise for numerous applications.

We ﬁrst outline our method as applied to H2 and
then indicate how it diﬀers from what preceded [7, 8].
Fig. 2 displays electron distances in the H2 molecule.
All distances are expressed in terms of the Bohr length
a0 = ¯h2/me2, where m is the electron mass, and energies
are in the Hartree unit e2/a0. We start with ˆHΨ = EΨ,

This is exactly the energy function that applies to the

The usual D-scaling procedure [7, 8]

involves set-
ting up the full Laplacian in D-dimension and trans-
forming the wavefunction by incorporating the square
J −1/2Φ, where J =
root of the Jacobian via Ψ
(ρ1ρ2)D−2(sin φ)D−3. Then, on scaling the coordinates

Our procedure, designed to reduce to the Bohr model
at the large-D limit, instead incorporates only the radial
portion of the Jacobian in transforming the wavefunc-
tion via Eq. (3). This has important consequences. Fig.
potential energy curve of Eq.
3 displays the D
(7) (dashed curve, “full-J”); which exhibits no binding.
However, our “Bohr model” limit obtained from Eq. (6)
yields a good zero-order approximation for the ground
state (curve 2 in Fig. 3). It is surprisingly accurate at
both large and small internuclear distances R. Also, the
model predicts the ground state is bound with an equi-
librium separation Re = 8/(9
1.10 and gives

the binding energy as EB = 3(2

a.u.= 2.73 eV. The Heitler-London calculation (shown in
Fig. 1, dashed curve), obtained from a two-term vari-
ational function, gives Re = 1.51 and EB = 3.14 eV
[13], whereas the “exact” results are Re = 1.401 and
EB = 4.745 eV [1].

For the triplet 3Σ+

u state, as seen in Fig. 1, the Bohr
model energy function of Eq. (6) gives a remarkably close
agreement with the “exact” potential curve and is in fact
much better than the Heitler-London result (which, e.g.,
is 30% high at R = 2).

In essence, D-scaling procedures resemble gauge trans-
formations. Many varieties of scaling are feasible, sub-
ject only to the constraint that as D
3 the scaled
Schr¨odinger equation reduces to the correct form. The
basic aim is to devise a scaling that removes the ma-
jor, generic D-dependence, enabling the easily evaluated
D
limit to approximate the D = 3 energy. With the
“full-J” scaling previously used [8], when D is increased
the (sin φ)D−3 factor in the Jacobian forces φ towards
90◦, while minimization of electron-electron repulsion re-
180◦. The eﬀect is to overweight electron
quires φ
repulsion; this is the chief source of the failure to obtain
chemical bonding in previous work. Our new procedure
avoids such overweighting by retaining the D = 3 form
for the φ-part of both the Jacobian and the Laplacian
of Eq. (2). Thereby φ remains a fully quantum variable

much improves description of the electron repulsion and
hence the chemical bonding.

The scaling procedure enables, in the large-D limit, cal-
culations to be carried out in the scaled space that are
entirely classical. The extremum equations ∂E/∂z = 0
and ∂E/∂ρ = 0 are equivalent to Newton’s second law
applied to the motion of each electron. Respectively,
they specify that the net Coulomb force on the electron
along the z
axis vanishes and that the projection of the
Coulomb force perpendicular to the molecular axis bal-
ances the centrifugal force. Although the electrons are
thereby conﬁned to speciﬁc orbits in the scaled space,
the uncertainty principle is nonetheless satisﬁed. This is
so because the conjugate momenta are scaled inversely to
the coordinates, leaving the position-momentum commu-
tator invariant. The continuous transition between the
scaled space and the unscaled space in eﬀect relates clas-
sical trajectories at large-D to corresponding quantum
distributions at D=3. This aspect becomes particularly
evident when treating electronic tunneling [7].

Fig. 4 displays the “exact” electron charge density
along the molecular axis in the ground state of H2 for
internuclear spacing R = 0.8 and 1.4 a.u. Circles show
electron orbits in Bohr’s model. The orbit positions for
any R actually coincide with the maxima in the charge
density. This provides a link between the wave mechani-
limit) treatments of the H2 bond.

in powers of the displacement from the minimum [7]; for
He this has yielded highly accurate results [10]. Terms
quadratic in the displacement describe harmonic oscil-
lations about the minimum and give a 1/D correction
to the energy. A symmetry breaking point occurs at
Rc = 1.2, beyond which the electron orbits move apart
(c.f. Fig. 4). Such symmetry breaking is a typical fea-
ture exhibited as Z or R is varied at large-D [7, 15]. The
1/D correction works well at points substantially below
or above Rc. Results for those regions thus can be com-
bined. This involves transforming the axial coordinates
z2, in order to separate the double-well structure
to z1 ±
z2. With the other coordinates ﬁxed at
that occurs in z1−
their values at the minimum of U + V , a one-dimensional
Schr¨odinger equation is solved to take into account the
double-well mode. This contribution to the 1/D correc-
tion corresponds to electron resonance or exchange. The
result gives good agreement with the “exact” E(R) over
the full range of R (lower solid line in Fig. 3). The
1/D correction predicts the equilibrium separation to be
Re = 1.38 with binding energy EB = 4.50 eV.

The Bohr and D-scaling techniques taken together hold
promise for numerous applications. In particular, these
provide a new approach to treating excited states. For
example, in our analysis the energy of 1s2s state of the He
atom is obtained as an extremum of the energy function
2 + V (r1, r2), where n1 = 1 and n2 =
E = n2
2; r1, r2 are electron radius vectors and V is the Coulomb
potential energy. This yields the value of
2.159 a.u.
which diﬀers by 0.7% from the “exact” 1s2s energy of
2.144 a.u. For other excited states of He as well as
−
more complex atoms the combination of the Bohr and
D-scaling approaches also provides accurate results; we
will discuss this elsewhere.

Another useful strategy is to combine the present ap-
proach with conventional electronic structure methods.
At D = 3, evaluation of the correlation energy, Ecorr

diﬃculty. However, at D

accurate energy curve E(R) can be obtained by adding
the D
correlation energy to the E(R) given by the
Heitler-London eﬀective charge method. The result is
practically identical to the curve obtained from the 1/D

Our modiﬁed D-scaling procedure reincarnates the
Bohr model. This requires only elementary concepts
and (laptop) computations yet provides a rather good
description of electron-electron interaction and chemi-
cal bonding. The procedure is readily applicable to
many-electron molecules, both ground and excited states.
These results encourage eﬀorts to further improve D-
scaling and to augment conventional variational methods
for electronic structure to incorporate the exact correla-
tion energy attainable at the large-D limit.

(Dated: January 17, 2014)
We compute ground and excited state properties of small helium clusters 4HeN containing a single
benzene impurity molecule. Ground-state structures and energies are obtained for N = 1, 2, 3, 14
from importance-sampled, rigid-body diﬀusion Monte Carlo (DMC). Excited state energies due to
helium vibrational motion near the molecule surface are evaluated using the projection operator,
imaginary time spectral evolution (POITSE) method. We ﬁnd excitation energies of up to ∼ 23 K
above the ground state. These states all possess vibrational character of helium atoms in a highly
anisotropic potential due to the aromatic molecule, and can be categorized in terms of localized
and collective vibrational modes. These results appear to provide precursors for a transition from
localized to collective helium excitations at molecular nanosubstrates of increasing size. We discuss
the implications of these results for analysis of anomalous spectral features in recent spectroscopic
studies of large aromatic molecules in helium clusters.

INTRODUCTION

Helium droplets provide a unique, ultra-cold nanolabo-
ratory for investigation of a variety of physical and chem-
ical phenomena.1 This has been increasingly used in re-
cent years to analyze the behavior of a wide variety of
atomic and molecular species in a quantum liquid envi-
ronment, using spectroscopic techniques to probe both
the molecular and helium dynamics.2 Electronic spec-
troscopy in particular allows one to probe microscopic
details of the helium dynamics.
In the large droplet
regime (N ≥ 103), the laser-induced ﬂuorescence (LIF)
spectra of molecules in cold helium droplets are usually
characterized by a sharp zero-phonon line (ZPL) due to
the transition for the electronic origin, accompanied by a
broad, phonon wing sideband. The zero-phonon line can
contain ﬁne structure due to internal molecular transi-
tions, while the phonon wing structure reﬂects the cou-
pling to collective excitations of the surrounding helium.
Thus, electronic excitation spectrum of glyoxal, a small 6-
atom molecule (C2H2O2), in 4He droplets at T = 0.38 K,
exhibits a distinct phonon wing feature that is separated
by a gap from the zero-phonon transition.3 In contrast, in
3He droplets the corresponding spectrum shows a phonon
wing feature but no gap.4 The phonon wing structure for
glyoxal in has been successfully interpreted in terms of ex-
citation of the collective phonon-roton modes in large 4He
droplets,3 while the lack of a gap between zero phonon
and phonon wing features in 3He droplets has been in-
terpreted as consistent with the presence of particle-hole
excitations in normal 3He.4 Recent spectroscopic exper-
iments involving larger organic molecules in 4HeN clus-
ters have revealed interesting additional features beyond
these basic elements.5 For a number of the larger organic
molecules studied so far, both the ZPL and phonon wing
portions of the LIF spectra exhibit sharp peaks superim-
posed on the underlying features. These additional peaks
are not compatible with this basic picture of molecular

electronic excitation coupling to either internal molecular
transitions or bulk compressional modes of helium.6,7,8,9

In addition to these experiments in large helium
droplets, a new class of size-selective experiments involv-
ing small numbers (N ≤ 20) of 4He atoms attached
to large planar aromatic molecules has also recently
emerged.10,11 These small cluster studies allow one to
directly observe the size evolution of excited states in-
volving helium motion, at sizes less than a full solvation
shell around the molecule. For these small clusters, which
are better described as weakly bound complexes with he-
lium than as quantum solvated molecules, a very diﬀerent
situation pertains. Starting with N = 1, the experimen-
tal spectra show discrete lines that generally increase in
complexity with increasing N , with the number of ob-
served lines reaching a maximum at N ∼ 4 − 5. After
this, many of the discrete features observed for smaller
N disappear, until only a few lines persist at N ∼ 10.

The larger organic molecules that have been stud-
ied experimentally vary in complexity from planar aro-
matics such as tetracene (a fused conjugated system
of four six-membered carbon rings connected by com-
mon bonds)6,7 to more complex heterostructures such
as phthalocyanine9 and indole derivatives.8 The pres-
ence of aromatic character due to π-electron conjuga-
tion provides a common feature in these systems. Be-
cause of their geometry and π-electron character, planar
aromatics such as tetracene are particularly interesting
for study in helium droplets because they can be con-
sidered as nanoscale precursors to a bulk graphite sur-
face and their local quantum solvation structure con-
comitantly as a nanoscale precursor of the adsorption
behavior of thin helium ﬁlms on graphite. A consider-
able body of literature has been accumulated for helium
ﬁlms on graphite,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22 so that anal-
ysis of the solvation structure and helium excitations as
a function of increasing size of polyaromatic molecule of-
fers the possibility of developing a microscopic under-

standing of the evolution from quantum solvation of an
isolated molecule, to adsorption and ﬁlm formation at a
bulk surface in superﬂuid helium.

The unusual features recorded in experimental spectra
for these organic molecules consist of unidentiﬁed peaks
in the phonon wings of vibronic bands9 and anomalous
splittings of the zero-phonon lines.6,7,8 It has been spec-
ulated that both of these types of features may be due to
some type of excitation of helium atoms that are localized
at the molecular surface,7,8,9 but the true origin of both
of these types of features is unclear. Supporting evidence
for excitations of localized helium atoms derives from the
similarity of the energies for phonon wing peaks with
low-frequency modes of thin ﬁlms on graphite (4 − 11 K)
observed via neutron scattering23,24 as well as from the-
oretical predictions of spatially localized helium atoms
at an aromatic ring in the benzene molecule.25 Path in-
tegral calculations reveal this to be a true localization
of helium atoms that are eﬀectively completely removed
from participation in the superﬂuid, thereby constituting
a single ”dead” atom in the surrounding solvation layer.
The characteristics of excitations of such localized he-
lium atoms around aromatic substrates are expected to
be very diﬀerent from the collective helium modes found
in large droplets,26,27,28 but to show increasing similarity
with surface localized modes in helium ﬁlms23,24 as the
size of the molecular nanosubstrate increases.

Theoretical analysis of the phenomenology of these he-
lium excitations near a molecular nanosubstrate is ren-
dered diﬃcult due both to the lack of accurate interac-
tion potentials for these larger molecules with helium,
and to the need for accurate calculation of excited states
in a very inhomogeneous quantum liquid environment.
Only a few direct calculations to elucidate the nature
of these helium excitations in the presence of a large
molecular impurity have been reported so far, and these
have been restricted to very small numbers of helium
atoms (N = 1, 2).29,30,31 Calculations involving doped
clusters require accurate helium-impurity potential en-
ergy surfaces, of which there is a deﬁnite lack for the
larger organic molecules. Thus, most calculations with
large molecules resort to the use of simple atom-atom
pair potential models. Given a potential surface, excited
state calculations employing basis set methods are still
limited to small N , where N is typically no greater than
two.29,30,31 For larger numbers of helium atoms that are
however not yet in the regime of bulk ﬁlms, a practical
approach is provided by calculations for excited states
that are based on quantum Monte Carlo methods.

In this work, we present a series of such quantum
Monte Carlo studies of the ground and excited states
of small helium clusters (N = 1, 2, 3, 14) containing
a benzene impurity. Benzene is a simple planar aro-
matic molecule, and it can be viewed as a primitive sp3-
hybridized unit of a bulk graphite surface. Thus, it is
the logical starting point for the kind of systematic study
of helium adsorption on molecular nanosubstrates men-
tioned above. We note that this notion has been pursued

2

extensively for the heavier noble gases,32 but it is only
recently that experimental data for helium has become
available. We employ here both the well-known ground-
state diﬀusion Monte Carlo method and the projection
operator imaginary time spectral evolution (POITSE)
method for excited states.33 The latter approach allows
exact excitation energies to be obtained, provided a high-
quality trial function approximating the ground state is
available. We calculate a range of helium excitation en-
ergies at T = 0 K and analyze these in terms of their
spatial nature and extent. The previous path integral
calculations for the 4He39-benzene system at a temper-
ature of T = 0.625 K have shown that the eﬀect of the
strength and strong π-anisotropy of the He-benzene in-
teraction serves to localize a single helium atom on each
side of the benzene surface.25 That is, in the Feynman
path integral representation, a single helium atom at-
tached to the benzene surface is completely removed from
permutation exchanges with the surrounding helium en-
vironment. In this work, we ﬁnd a set of collective helium
vibrations which have energies of up to ∼ 23 K above the
ground state, and can be characterized in terms of their
transformation properties under the symmetry group of
the He-benzene interaction potential. We show that even
for sizes as small as N = 14 helium atoms, one can dis-
tinguish a subset of higher-energy excitations localized
near the global minimum of the helium-benzene interac-
tion potential, from a subset of lower-energy collective
excitations which are delocalized around the periphery
of the molecule surface. The former appear to be asso-
ciated with the localized helium density identiﬁed from
path integral calculations in Ref. 25.

Sec. II begins with a discussion of the model Hamil-
tonian and potential surface. Technical details of the
quantum Monte Carlo methodology are presented in
Sec. III. Our results for ground and excited states of
4HeN -benzene (N = 1, 2, 3, 14) are presented in Sec. V,
where we analyze the nature of these molecule-induced
localized states around the benzene impurity and, and in
Sec. VI we discuss the implications for helium excitations
on larger aromatic molecules.

II. THE MODEL HAMILTONIAN

We treat the 4HeN -benzene cluster as a collection of
N indistinguishable helium atoms, and a rigid benzene
molecule which is free to translate and rotate in space.
Thus the benzene intramolecular degrees of freedom are
held ﬁxed, which implicitly assumes a separation between
the helium motion and the benzene vibrational modes.
The positions of the N helium atoms in a space-ﬁxed (SF)
frame of reference are denoted as {R1, R2, . . . , RN }, and
the SF position of the benzene center-of-mass is denoted
as RI . The Hamiltonian ˆH is (3N + 6)–dimensional:
there are 3N helium translational degrees of freedom,
plus an additional six dimensions due to translation and
rigid-body rotation of the benzene molecule. It takes the

carbon and carbon-hydrogen bond lengths are held ﬁxed at
rCC and rCH, respectively, and all bond angles are 120◦.

where ˆT (imp), ˆT (He), and ˆV are the impurity rigid-body
kinetic energy, helium kinetic energy, and total poten-
tial energy, respectively. The impurity kinetic energy
is most easily expressed by introducing a moving body-
ﬁxed (BF) frame (ˆx, ˆy, ˆz), whose origin relative to the SF
frame is ﬁxed at the benzene center-of-mass RI . The Eu-
ler angles (ϕ, ϑ, χ) specify the orientation of the BF axes,
which are set parallel to the benzene principal axes. The
benzene kinetic energy is thus

the benzene rigid-body rotational kinetic energy, where
the prefactors da = 0.188 cm−1 and dc = 0.0938 cm−1
are the (oblate) symmetric top rotational constants. The
Laplacian ∇2

the benzene center-of-mass. The angular second deriva-
tives are taken with respect to rotations of the benzene
about the BF axes (ˆx, ˆy, ˆz). Similarly, the next term of
the Hamiltonian is the helium kinetic energy,

veniently expressed in terms of helium BF frame coordi-

The potential ﬁt parameters are listed in Table I. This
helium-benzene potential possesses two equivalent global
minima of −94.97 K at z = ±3.27 ˚A along the benzene
C6-axis. There are also 12 equivalent secondary min-
ima of −62.54 K located between neighboring hydrogen
atoms, six above and six below the benzene plane. The
global minima are connected to the secondary minima by
saddle points of −50.77 K, situated approximately above
and below the C–H bonds. A cut of the potential at
z = 3.27 ˚A is shown in the top panel of Fig. 1, where
the (x, y) positions of the carbon and hydrogen atoms
on the z = 0 plane are also marked. The lower panel of
Fig. 1 shows a cut of the potential along the y = 0 plane,
which reveals one of the secondary minima at x = 2.84 ˚A,
z = 2.70 ˚A, and one of the saddle points at x = 1.97 ˚A,
z = 3.54 ˚A.

For N = 1, the model Hamiltonian of Eq. (1) be-
longs to the molecular symmetry group D6h(M ), which is
the subgroup consisting of only the feasible elements of
the complete nuclear permutation and inversion group
(CNPI).36 This group is isomorphic to the D6h point
group, which is valid in the limit of small amplitude he-
lium motions. For N > 1, the symmetry group is iden-
tically D6h(M ) due to Bose symmetry, since the only
allowed rovibrational states are those obtained from the
tensor product of irreducible representations of D6h(M ),

III. COMPUTATIONAL METHODOLOGY

In this section we present a summary of the numeri-
cal methods employed in our study of the 4HeN -benzene
system. Variational estimates of ground-state energies
are obtained from variational Monte Carlo (VMC), and
exact ground-state properties are computed from diﬀu-
sion Monte Carlo (DMC) with importance sampling.37,38
The projection operator, imaginary time spectral evolu-
tion (POITSE) approach is used to obtain excited-state
energies.33 Both the DMC and POITSE methods can
provide results that are exact, to within a systematic
time step error.

A. Ground states: variational Monte Carlo (VMC)

The starting point for our study of the 4HeN -benzene
system begins with the Rayleigh-Ritz variational theo-
rem,

ET =

hΨT | ˆH|ΨT i
hΨT |ΨT i

≥ E0,

(9)

(10)

where the trial energy ET with respect to some param-
eterized trial function ΨT represents an upper bound to
the exact ground-state energy E0. In the coordinate rep-
resentation, this becomes

ET =

dR Ψ2

T (R)EL(R)
T (R)

dR Ψ2

,

R

R

where R is a (3N + 6)–dimensional coordinate denoting
the positions and orientations of all bodies governed by
the Hamiltonian ˆH. The quantity EL is a local energy,
deﬁned as

EL(R) = Ψ−1

T (R) ˆHΨT (R).

(11)

An optimized variational upper bound is obtained by
varying the parameters of ΨT to minimize ET .

For a realistic N -particle helium system, Monte Carlo
methods oﬀer a practical means to compute the multi-
dimensional integral of Eq. (10).
In variational Monte
Carlo, expectation values of observables are evaluated as
averages over the normalized distribution

f (R) =

which is numerically represented as a discrete ensemble
of Monte Carlo walkers {Rk}. Typically, we use an en-
semble size of nw = 2000 walkers. This distribution can
be generated from a Metropolis walk, in which a move

(13)

The vector quantity F is commonly referred to as the
“quantum force”, and is chosen to be

Fj(R) = 2Ψ−1

T (R)∇j ΨT (R).

(14)

GD can be viewed as the Green’s function associated
with a diﬀusion/drift process in the presence of an ex-
ternal ﬁeld F, over a time step of ∆τ . All VMC-
based computations reported here use a time step of
∆τ = 75 − 100 Hartree−1. For the 4HeN -benzene sys-
tem the full (3N + 6)–dimensional transition probability
is comprised of N such factors with diﬀusion constant
D = D4 corresponding to the N helium atoms, a fac-
tor with D = DI corresponding to the benzene impurity,
and three analogous one-dimensional factors correspond-
ing to individual rotations of the benzene about each of
its three principal axes. A proposed move R → R′ is sub-
sequently accepted with probability p = min(1, q), where
the acceptance ratio q is

q =

(15)

With the choice of transition and acceptance probabil-
ities given by Eqs. (13)–(15), the Metropolis walk con-
verges to the asymptotic distribution Ψ2
T (R). At this
point, expectation values for quantities such as the vari-
ational trial energy ET are sampled from this distribution
as

ET = hELi =

where the notation h. . .iwalk denotes a statistical average
over the course of the equilibrated Metropolis walk. This
is performed by sampling the quantity given in h. . .iwalk
every M time steps apart, with M chosen to be longer
than the autocorrelation length in order to minimize cor-
relation biases in the error estimates; typically M = 50
for our VMC computations here.

B. Ground states: diﬀusion Monte Carlo (DMC)

With diﬀusion Monte Carlo (DMC), one can move
beyond the variational level of theory to obtain exact
ground-state expectation values for the energy and quan-
tities which commute with the Hamiltonian ˆH. This

−

∂Ψ(R, τ )
∂τ

= ( ˆH − Er ef )Ψ(R, τ ),

(17)

where Ψ(R, τ ) is the many-body wave function, and Er ef
is an arbitrary constant shift in the energy spectrum.
Importance sampling is introduced by multiplying both
sides of Eq. (17) by a trial function ΨT (R), and rewriting
in terms of f (R, τ ) = ΨT (R)Ψ(R, τ ) to obtain a set of
equations having the form

−

∂f (R, τ )
∂τ

= −D∇2

j f (R, τ ) + D∇j · Fj (R)f (R, τ )

+ [EL(R) − Er ef ]f (R, τ ).

(18)

The stationary solution is now the normalized “mixed”
distribution

f (R) =

ΨT (R)φ0(R)
dR ΨT (R)φ0(R)

,

(19)

where φ0 is the exact many-body ground-state wave func-
tion. In DMC, the approximate short-time Green’s func-
tion G which generates this distribution is

R

G(R → R′, ∆τ ) ≈ GD(R → R′, ∆τ )GB(R → R′, ∆τ ).
(20)
Here, GD is the diﬀusion/drift Green’s function of
Eq. (13), and GB has the form

GB(R → R′, ∆τ ) =

EL(R) + EL(R′)
2

exp

−

(21)

(cid:21)

(cid:27)

All DMC-based computations here use a time step of
∆τ = 25 Hartree−1. A proposed move R → R′ is ac-
cepted or rejected according to Eq. (15), to ensure that
the exact ground state is sampled in the limit of per-
fect importance sampling, i.e. when ΨT (R) = φ0(R).
For a non-exact trial function however, the approximate
Green’s function of Eq. (20) results in a systematic time
step error.

Operationally, the importance-sampled DMC proce-
dure is similar to that described previously for VMC,
except now associated with each walker Rk is a cumula-
tive weight wk due to the action of GB:

wk =

GB(Rk → R′

(22)

n=1
Y

The eﬃciency of the DMC method can be signiﬁcantly
improved by replicating walkers with large wk, and de-
stroying walkers with small wk. At every 10 − 50 time
steps, the ensemble is checked for walkers whose weight
exceeds the empirically set bounds wmin and wmax. A
walker Rk with weight wk > wmax is replicated into
nk = int(wk + u) walkers, where u is a uniform random

number on [0, 1). These new walkers are then assigned
the weight wk/nk. A walker Rk with weight wk < wmin
is destroyed with probability 1 − wk; otherwise its weight
is set to unity. This is to ensure that the branching
scheme, on average, does not artiﬁcially alter the ensem-
ble sum of weights Wtot =
wk. The parameters wmin
and wmax are chosen empirically to maintain a stable
P
DMC walk with respect to Wtot and the ensemble size;
here we use wmin = 0.1 − 0.3 and wmax = 2.0 − 2.2. Ad-
ditionally, we also vary the reference energy Er ef during
the course of the walk according to

Er ef (τ +∆τ ) = Er ef (τ )+

ln

η
∆τ

Wtot(τ )
Wtot(τ + ∆τ )

(cid:20)

. (23)

(cid:21)

Here, the imaginary-time dependence of the Er ef and
Wtot is explicitly written. We set Er ef initially to be the
starting ensemble average for the local energy hELi. The
empirical update parameter η is chosen to be as small as
possible, typically η/∆τ = 0.0004 − 0.004, which gives
ﬂuctuations in Wtot of roughly 5%.

Once the ensemble converges to the mixed distribution
ΨT (R)φ0(R), mixed expectation values for a Hermitian
observable ˆO can be obtained as

h ˆOimix =

(26)

In our ground-state DMC calculations, this average is
computed by sampling ˆO every M = 150 time steps
apart, which is larger than that used for VMC because
successive DMC iterations are more strongly correlated
due to the smaller DMC time steps that we use here.
In the case where φ0 is an eigenstate of ˆO, i.e. when ˆO
commutes with the Hamiltonian ˆH, this procedure yields
exact expectation values. All ground-state energies re-
ported in this work are derived from the mixed estimator
for the local energy, and are thus exact. For quantities
which do not commute with ˆH, such as the local helium
j δ(r − rj), the mixed estima-
density operator ˆρ(r) =
tor is biased by the trial function ΨT . But as pointed
out by Liu et al.,39 the asymptotic weight wk(τ → ∞) of
a walker Rk is proportional to φ0(Rk)/ΨT (Rk). Thus,

where M ′ is taken to be as large as possible, typically
M ′ = 1500. When branching processes are incorpo-
rated in the DMC, one needs to take care to keep track
of walkers that descended from a walker Rk at time τ .
All helium densities reported in this work (N ≤ 14) are
computed by reweighting walkers Rk by their descendant
weights, i.e. using Eq. (27). However, the statistical noise
seen in the densities computed in this manner is much
greater than from densities obtained using the mixed es-
timator, and thus this approach becomes problematic for
4HeN -benzene at still larger sizes.

C. Excited states: projection operator imaginary
time spectral evolution (POITSE)

The POITSE approach is a DMC-based method which
can provide exact excited state energies, subject to a sys-
tematic time step bias.33 It begins with the DMC evalu-
ation of the imaginary-time correlation function

˜κ(τ ) =

hΨT | ˆAe−( ˆH−Er ef )τ ˆA†|ΨT i
hΨT |e−( ˆH−Er ef )τ |ΨT i
|hφn| ˆA†|ΨT i|2e−(En−E0)τ + O(x2)

.

Here, {φn} and {En} represent a complete set of energy
eigenstates and eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian ˆH, re-
spectively, and ˆA† is an operator chosen to connect ΨT
to the excited state(s) of interest φn. ΨT should be a
good approximation to the exact ground state φ0. To
second order in x, ˜κ(τ ) is a superposition of exponential
decays whose decay rates correspond to the energy diﬀer-
ences En − E0.40,41 The VMC procedure of Sec. III A is
used to generate an initial ensemble of nw = 2000 walkers
distributed according to f (R, 0) ∝ Ψ2
T (R). This distri-
bution is then propagated in imaginary time using the
DMC procedure outlined in Sec. III B, during which the
correlation function ˜κ(τ ) is sampled from the DMC walk

explicitly emphasize the imaginary-time dependence of
the DMC quantities Wtot, nw, and wk.

spectral function

κ(E) ∝

|hφn| ˆA†|ΨT i|2δ(E − En + E0),

(34)

whose peak positions give the excited state energies
En − E0. The additive contributions O(x2) are neglected
in Eq. (34), since they do not aﬀect the positions of the
peaks associated with En − E0, and in practice, their
spectral weights are negligible for a reasonable choice of
ΨT .33,40 The numerical inverse Laplace transform is per-
formed using the Maximum Entropy Method (MEM), in
which the Laplace inversion is formulated as a data anal-
ysis problem in terms of Bayesian probability theory.42
We adopt here the vector notation κ ≡ {κ(Ei)∆E} to de-
note the discrete spectral function speciﬁed at intervals
of width ∆E, and ˜κ ≡ {˜κ(τi)∆τ } to denote the correla-
tion function sampled at intervals of ∆τ . The Bayesian
approach begins with the posterior distribution function

p(κ|˜κ, α, m, I) ∝ eαS−L.

(35)

The posterior p represents the probability of obtaining
the image κ, given the Monte Carlo data ˜κ, the param-
eter α, an initial guess for the image m (also referred
to as the default model), and any other relevant back-
ground information I. We use a constant value for the
default model m. The quantity S is the Shannon-Jaynes
information-theoretic entropy,

S =

κi − mi − κi log

Carlo noise. For α > 0, the search for ˆκ requires that
the entropy S be simultaneously maximized while χ2 is
minimized. Thus, α can be viewed as a regularization
parameter, which stabilizes the least-squares ﬁt by con-
straining the minimization of χ2.

In the ideal situation where the spectrum consists of a
single, sharp peak, we take the excitation energy En − E0
to be the ﬁrst moment of the spectrum,

En − E0 = hEi =

The corresponding estimate for the variance of the mean

which requires knowledge of the covariance matrix C for
the image ˆκ. By approximating p as a sharply-peaked
Gaussian in the neighborhood of ˆκ, the covariance of the
image becomes44

C = −(α∇∇S − ∇∇L)−1.

(40)

When the spectrum is composed of multiple, well-
separated peaks, the mean value of the peak and the
variance in the mean is obtained in the same manner
as given by Eqs. (38)–(39), except that the summation is
taken only over the spectral feature of interest. Note that
the approach taken here in evaluating error estimates dif-
fers somewhat from the Gaussian approach advocated in
Ref. 45. In the Gaussian approach the variance in En−E0
is associated with the peak width, and thus does not nec-
essarily scale as 1/Nd, where Nd is the number of DMC
decays used to compute statistics for the covariance ma-
trix ˜C of Eq. (37). Here, we obtain En − E0 from the
mean peak position, and then evaluate the variance of the
mean according to Eqs. (38)–(39), which by construction
scales as 1/Nd.

and L = χ2/2 is chosen to be the usual Gaussian likeli-
hood. In matrix notation, χ2 takes the form

IV. TRIAL FUNCTIONS AND EXCITATION
OPERATORS

χ2 = ( ˆLκ − ˜κ)T · ˜C−1 · ( ˆLκ − ˜κ),

(37)

where ˆL is the Laplace operator, and ˜C is the covariance
matrix for the data ˜κ. In this work, ˜C is obtained from
averaging Nd = 256 decays, which is suﬃcient to give
well-converged spectra for N ≤ 3. A search is then made
for the image ˆκ which maximizes the posterior p, using
a search algorithm due to Bryan.43 In the limit α = 0,
this reduces to a standard least-squares data-ﬁtting pro-
cedure involving the minimization of χ2, which is numer-
ically unstable when one seeks to infer a free-form solu-
tion for the image from data with non-negligible Monte

While in principle a fully converged DMC result should
be independent of the trial function ΨT , a good choice
of ΨT which closely approximates the exact ground state
φ0 can signiﬁcantly improve computational eﬃciency. On
the other hand, a poor choice of ΨT can produce mislead-
ing results. In this study, we use analytical forms moti-
vated by basic physical considerations. The trial function
is a product of two-body factors,

The terms involving the parameters cC, cH ensure that
ΨT goes to zero as a helium atom approaches a carbon or
hydrogen atom, where rαj and rβj denote helium-carbon
and helium-hydrogen distances, respectively. The r−6
and r−5 forms are chosen to cancel the leading singular-
ity in the local energy47 due to the helium-benzene pair
potential of Eq. (6).

With ξ = ξ0 alone, it is known that the resulting trial
function describes a ground state with “liquid”-like char-
acteristics. If the true ground state has “solid”-like qual-
ities, i.e. individual helium atoms are strongly localized
around the molecular impurity, such a state will not so-
lidify out of a liquid-like trial function at the variational
level of theory, within reasonable VMC simulation times.
One simple way to incorporate solid-like features a pri-
ori is to introduce a set of sites {sγ} ﬁxed in the BF
frame. The remaining factors ξγ (γ > 0) serve to localize
helium atoms near these sites. In this work we use the
exponential of a Gaussian to eﬀect this localization:48

ξγ(rj ) = exp

cγe−aγ |rj −sγ |

.

(45)

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

The speciﬁcation of the sites {sγ} is given later in
Sec. V A. A more sophisticated variational approach
would involve the extension of this trial function to
shadow functions, in which the {sγ} are treated as sub-
sidiary variables, thus obviating the need for an a pri-
ori speciﬁcation of {sγ}.49 While a shadow trial function
is expected to yield a signiﬁcantly better description of
the ground state, we do not employ this approach here
because it introduces additional complexity due to the
need to sample the subsidiary variables {sγ} in VMC
and DMC.

In the POITSE formulation, an initial ansatz for the
excited state is generated by the action of an excitation
operator ˆA† on ΨT , and exact excited-state energies are

8

then extracted from the DMC imaginary-time evolution
of this initial state. Due to the inherent numerical diﬃ-
culties in the MEM inversion when the target image κ(E)
contains multiple, closely-spaced peaks of comparable
spectral weight, we seek operators ˆA† which connect ΨT
to only one or a few energetically well-separated states.
Thus, one consideration is to choose ˆA† to transform as
an irreducible representation of the D6h(M ) group, such
that the spectral weight hφn| ˆA†|ΨT i is only non-zero for
states φn which transform identically. For systems with
a relatively high degree of symmetry, such a choice of
ˆA† would signiﬁcantly reduce the number of individual
decays contributing to ˜κ(τ ).

In the BF representation, a convenient primitive for

ˆA† are provided by the regular spherical harmonics:

Rlm(r) = rl

Ylm(θ, φ).

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

Similar operators have been used previously to study ro-
tationally excited states of small 4HeN and (H2)N clus-
ters (N = 7, 40).50,51 For a pure cluster, this yields trial
excited states which are simultaneous eigenstates of the
square of the total helium angular momentum ˆL2, and
its SF z-component ˆLz. Addition of a benzene impurity
lowers the symmetry to D6h(M ). In this case the set of
regular spherical harmonics can be symmetrized by tak-
ing linear combinations of Rlm and Rl,−m to obtain real
operators which transform as irreducible representations
of D6h(M ):

except for m = 3, and thus from this point on we drop
the subscripts c and s for the degenerate functions ex-
cept when the distinction is necessary. For N > 1, these

Thus, the action of ˆA†
lm is to impose a trial nodal struc-
ture on the helium-benzene factor ξ, generating a trial ex-
cited state corresponding to a Bose-symmetrized single-
excitation excited state. As will be discussed further in
Sec. V B, these operators can be further reﬁned to take
into account the localization of the helium density near
the molecule surface. In principle this approach can also
be readily extended to multi-excitation operators.

V. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

A. Ground states

Ground-state energies and structures for the 4HeN -
benzene cluster (N = 1, 2, 3, 14) were computed using
the methodologies described in Secs. III A and III B. Our
general strategy for ground states is to ﬁrst begin with
a preliminary unbiased DMC calculation with ΨT = 1,
which gives an asymptotic DMC distribution propor-
tional to the exact Bose ground state φ0. However, such
an unbiased DMC approach for helium clusters has a
number of convergence issues associated with it. In the
absence of a guiding function, the DMC walk will spend
too much time sampling unimportant regions of conﬁgu-
ration space, and thus unbiased DMC can give an energy
which is not converged and is higher than the true value
of E0.38 Nevertheless, it can be useful in situations where
no other information is available, in particular to act as
a guide for constructing a suitable starting trial func-
tion ΨT . We ﬁrst compute a reduced ground-state wave
function ˜φ0(r) in the BF frame by binning the unbiased
DMC distribution φ0(R) onto a three-dimensional grid.

ξ, Eqs. (43)–(45), are then obtained by ﬁtting to this
˜φ0(r). In some cases, these parameters are further var-
ied to lower the variational energy, and the resulting trial
function is then used as input for an importance-sampled
DMC calculation. The ﬁnal optimized trial function pa-
rameters for the various sizes are listed in Table III.

The VMC and DMC results for the ground-state en-
ergy per particle E0/N are summarized in Table IV. For
N = 1 − 2, we ﬁnd that a simple trial function involving
ξ = ξ0 only, Eq. (44), is suﬃcient to give good DMC re-
sults. With the two global minima occupied at N = 2,
additional helium atoms begin to occupy the twelve sec-
ondary potential minima (Fig. 1). To describe this situ-
ation for N = 3, we incorporate localization factors ξγ,
Eq. (45), centered at sites {sγ′} and {sγ′′}. The set of
sites {sγ′} are centered near the two equivalent global
minima of the helium-benzene potential, the set {sγ′}
are centered near the twelve equivalent secondary poten-
tial minima. The N = 14 trial function is determined in

the same manner as N = 3, except that we now also in-
corporate additional localization factors centered at sites
{sγ′′′} which are situated near the six equivalent tertiary
potential minima. This allows for a description of helium
binding in these regions in the larger clusters. Three rep-
resentatives of the sites sγ′, sγ′′, sγ′′′ are marked on the
potential contour plot of Fig. 1. The positions of all cor-
responding sites are readily generated from application
of the elements of the D6h(M ) group.

Cuts of the helium density along the y = 0 plane are
shown in Fig. 2. These cuts are taken along a plane per-
pendicular to the benzene molecular plane, bisecting two
parallel carbon-carbon bonds. All structural quantities
given here are obtained from DMC using the descendant
weighting procedure described in Sec. III B, and are thus
sampled from the exact ground-state density distribution
φ2
0. For N = 1, 2, the helium density along the benzene
C6-axis has two maxima at z = ±3.7 ˚A, which is in good
agreement with the corresponding value of z = ±3.5 ˚A
inferred from spectroscopic measurements.52 The posi-
tions of these two density maxima remain unchanged as
N increases to 14. As evident in Fig. 2, the local density
near the benzene impurity is highly structured, which is
reﬂective of the strong anisotropy in the helium-benzene
interaction potential. We note that neglecting the rota-
tional terms in the benzene kinetic energy, Eq. (2), leads
to a considerably more strongly peaked helium density
distribution in the BF frame.53

B. Excited states

We have calculated helium vibrational excited-state
energies for the 4HeN -benzene system, using the POITSE
methodology described in Sec. III C. For the N = 1
dimer, each individual excitation operator ˆA†
lm gives a
well-deﬁned excitation, by which we mean a spectral
function κ(E) consisting of a single, sharp peak. This
indicates that the trial excited state given by ˆA†
lmΨT is
a good approximation to a true eigenstate of the system,
having non-negligible overlap with only a single φn. The
various spectral functions are superimposed and shown
in the upper panel of Fig. 3. For N = 1, these helium vi-
brational modes begin at ∼ 9 K above the ground state.
Below this onset, we would expect to see excitations in-
volving rotational motion of the much heavier benzene
impurity, which lie in the spectral range studied exper-
imentally by Beck et al.52 The excitations shown in the
upper panel of Fig. 3 can be grouped into pairs split by
∼ 0.6 − 2.3 K, corresponding to states generated by the
application of pairs of projectors which are symmetric
and antisymmetric with respect to reﬂection about the
benzene molecular plane (Table II). Since the N = 1
projectors used here all give well-deﬁned excitations, we
conclude that these states represent symmetric and an-
tisymmetric tunneling pairs. We are not able to extract
the lowest tunneling excitation given by the application
of the R10 = z operator. This is likely due to its en-

10

ergy being too close to the ground state E0, and thus its
DMC imaginary-time evolution is too slow relative to the
DMC propagation times used for the excited-state calcu-
lations here. These tunneling energetics are comparable
to those obtained from basis set calculations of the 2,3-
dimethylnaphthalene·He complex by Bach et al.29 These
authors found tunneling excitations associated with the
motion of the single complexed helium atom from one
side of the planar aromatic moiety to the other side, with
splittings ranging from < 0.0014 K for strongly localized
states, and up to 4.6 K for highly delocalized states.

The Bose-symmetrized versions of the excitation op-
erators used for N = 1 give a similar set of well-deﬁned
excitations for N = 2, which are shown in the lower panel
of Fig. 3. Thus, we conclude that these represent single-
particle-like excitations, which is reasonable since the two
helium atoms reside in the two equivalent global minima
along the benzene C6-axis, and are well-separated by the
benzene plane. In general, the N = 2 excitation energies
E − E0 tend to be slightly lower than those for N = 1,
with the onset of helium vibrational excitations begin-
ning at ∼ 7.5 K for N = 2, as compared to ∼ 9 K for
N = 1. Unlike the situation for N = 1, the addition of a
second particle now allows for a well-deﬁned excitation of
A2u symmetry at 7.63(4) K, obtained from the R10 = z
operator. We note that neglecting the rotational terms
in the benzene kinetic energy, Eq. (2), alters the energy
spectrum signiﬁcantly.41

With the two global minima occupied at N = 2, an ad-
ditional third helium atom must be delocalized over the
twelve secondary minima, due to the eﬀect of helium-
helium repulsions. Thus, the character of the excited
states is expected to change dramatically as the num-
ber of helium atoms increase from N = 2 to N = 3.
This is evident in the POITSE calculations, where the
projectors that give well-deﬁned excitations for N = 1, 2
(Fig. 3) now give multiple peaks for N = 3, shown in the
upper panel of Fig. 4. This indicates that the starting
excited state ansatz generated by ˆA†
lmΨT now has appre-
ciable overlap with more than one eigenstate. Since the
POITSE methodology does not provide information on
excited-state wave functions, interpretation of the N = 3
excitations is now less straightforward. Additional in-
sight can be gained by making modiﬁcations to the pro-
jectors. The most noticeable new feature of the N = 3
spectrum here is the appearance of lower-energy states
at < 9 K. Since the two atoms situated near the global
potential minima experience a very diﬀerent local envi-
ronment from the third atom that is delocalized over the
twelve secondary minima, the question then arises as to
whether one can ascribe any of the excitations to motion
localized near the global potential minima alone. We
explore this here by deﬁning a set of weighted “local”
excitation operators

By substituting Eq. (43) for ξ(rj) in Eq. (54) above, it
can be seen that the action of ˆB†
lm is to place an atom in
an excited single-particle state that is spatially localized
near the set of sites {sγ′} only, i.e. near the two global

that they act primarily on helium density near these two
minima, while still maintaining spatial and Bose per-
mutation symmetry.
In contrast, by comparison with
Eq. (51), we see that the ˆA† operators are global opera-

tors, acting on all sites.

The spectrum for N = 3 generated by the set of ˆB†-
type projectors is shown in the lower panel of Fig. 4.
Compared to the spectrum derived from ˆA†-type projec-
tors (upper panel of Fig. 4), the spectral weight of lower-
energy states are now reduced relative to the higher-
energy excitations. A few low-energy features at < 9 K
persist, in particular the R10 and R11 excitations, albeit
with reduced weights. Thus we conclude that the higher-
energy excitations above ∼ 9 K are associated with states
that are spatially localized near the global minimum of
the interaction potential, while the excitations below this
range are associated with collective helium states of a
more delocalized nature. For each set of states generated
by a projector of given l, corresponding states of diﬀer-
ent m are clustered more closely together than in the
N = 1, 2 spectra, with each cluster of diﬀerent l spaced
∼ 3 K apart.

As N increases from 3 to 14, the ground-state DMC
calculations reveal that the two global minima and twelve

secondary minima are completely occupied (see Sec. V A
and Fig. 2). An unambiguous determination of excited
state energies at this size becomes more diﬃcult due
to the increase in Monte Carlo noise. However, cer-
tain qualitative features remain apparent. The upper
panel of Fig. 5 shows the POITSE excitation spectrum
for N = 14, derived from the ˆA†-type global projectors.
These projectors generate trial excited states which over-
lap with multiple eigenstates, and the resulting spectrum
for a given projector has multiple peaks at both low and
high energies. This problem, along with the accompany-
ing increase in statistical noise in going to N = 14, gives
a spectrum which is not fully converged in the sense that
the peak widths are broader and the peak positions shift
(by up to ∼ 3 K) with additional sampling. Neverthe-
less, we can again achieve qualitative insight by compar-
ing with spectra derived from the localized ˆB†-type pro-
jectors. The lower panel of Fig. 5 shows the spectrum
derived from the ˆB†-type projectors. There, the spec-
tral weights of low-energy excitations (< 9 K) are again
signiﬁcantly reduced just as the N = 3 case, and each
projector ˆBlm gives a κ(E) consisting of a single domi-
nant peak. While the higher-energy l = 4 excitations are

probably still not fully converged, the l = 1 − 3 peaks do
not shift much (less than 0.5 K) with additional sampling,
and appear to be converged. Thus the qualitative trends
can be clearly established. Similar to the N = 3 case,
the localized projectors give rise to a set of higher-energy
excitations, except red-shifted by ∼ 3 K in comparison
to the N = 3 energies. For each l, states of diﬀerent
m are now clustered together as was also the case for
N = 3 (Fig. 4). These states represent the localized vi-
brational motion of a single helium atom near the global
potential minima, and appear to be associated with the
localized helium density found in the path integral cal-
culations of Ref. 25. The lower-energy excitations, on
the other hand, are associated with collective vibrations
delocalized around the periphery of the molecule surface.

VI. SUMMARY DISCUSSION AND
IMPLICATIONS FOR LARGER MOLECULES

We have computed ground-state energies and struc-
tures for small 4HeN -benzene clusters, where N =
1, 2, 3, 14. For these sizes, the eﬀect of the strong and

highly anisotropic helium-benzene interaction potential
gives rise to a very structured helium density distribu-
tion in the BF frame. In particular, a single helium atom
is well-localized at each of the two equivalent global po-
tential minima, above and below the benzene surface.
We ﬁnd a set of collective helium excitations with ener-
gies of up to ∼ 23 K above the ground state. Among
these excitations, the higher-energy states (> 9 K) can
be characterized as a localized excitation deriving from
the helium density near the global potential minima, i.e.
adsorbed on the molecular nanosurface. The existence of
these localized modes is consistent with the localization
of a single “dead” helium atom seen in Ref. 25. Helium
excitations of lower energies were also obtained, which
correspond to collective vibrations of helium atoms de-
localized over equivalent sites of lower binding energy,
situated near the edges of the benzene surface. Both
localized and delocalized excitations can also be further
classiﬁed by their symmetry with respect to the D6h(M )
group.

The energetic range of these helium excitations is simi-
lar to that observed experimentally as vibronic structure
in the mass-selective excitation spectra of planar aro-

13

matic molecules in small helium clusters (N ≤ 16).10,11
It is also similar to the energetic range of the peaks ob-
served in the phonon wings of vibronic spectra of planar
aromatic molecules in large helium droplets.6,7,8,9 Thus,
these calculations provide support for the picture of he-
lium atoms adsorbed and vibrating on the molecule sur-
face, with the speciﬁc details of the helium motions being
determined by the geometry of the surface. In particu-
lar, the close relationship between the anisotropy of the
molecule-helium interaction and the nature and energetic
range of the excitations seen here for benzene implies that
these molecule-induced vibrational modes will be very
sensitive to the identity of the molecule, possibly even to
the extent of providing a spectral “ﬁngerprint” of com-
plex polyaromatic species. Since these calculations have
less than one solvation shell of helium surrounding the
molecule, they are directly relevant to the recent exper-
imental observations for small cluster sizes.10,11 More-
over, the analysis of the excitations has been made in
terms of single-particle type excitation operators acting
on the many-body ground state, and is thus applicable
to any number of solvating helium atoms. The fact that
the localized excitation associated with the most strongly
bound helium density at the global minimum persists in
the largest cluster studied here (N = 14), together with
the previous identiﬁcation of localization at that site in
larger helium clusters,25 indicates that these localized
excitations will also be present in much larger helium
droplets. For the 4HeN -benzene system here we have ex-
amined the limit of a single helium adsorbed atom on a
single site given by the benzene nanosurface. But given
the energetics that we ﬁnd here, in a more general sense
this class of surface-adsorbed vibrations are very likely to
be responsible for the structure seen in the phonon wing
sideband in experiments using helium droplets.9

A detailed analysis of the experimental phonon wing
data clearly requires molecule-speciﬁc calculations with
accurate potential surfaces. For example, the region of
spatial conﬁnement for an adsorbed helium atom near
the global potential minimum is smaller in benzene than
in the larger polyaromatic molecules studied experimen-
tally with small numbers of helium atoms in Ref. 11. In a
general context, the present results are very encouraging
in that they show that the diﬀusion Monte-Carlo based
methodologies can be used to systematically study these
excitations as a function of the number of helium atoms,
provided that realistic molecule-helium interaction po-
tentials are available. We emphasize here that a quanti-
tative analysis, both for the small cluster vibronic exci-
tations and for the phonon wing structure in electronic
absorption spectra, will require detailed knowledge of the
molecule-helium interaction potential in both ground and
electronically excited states.

Less obvious than the relation to phonon wing struc-
ture is whether the excitations of the type studied here
are responsible for the splittings on the order of ∼ 1 K in
the zero-phonon line, which were observed for some large
organic impurity molecules in large helium droplets. This

zero-phonon line splitting has been experimentally stud-
ied in detail for tetracene,7,8 and for indole derivatives.8
In both experimental studies rotational ﬁne structure has
been ruled out as being responsible and several diﬀer-
ent interpretations have been advanced. For tetracene, a
molecule possessing a plane of mirror symmetry, it has
been suggested that either two inequivalent helium bind-
ing sites exist, possibly due to an inhomogeneous solva-
tion environment, or that some kind of two-particle tun-
neling is manifested.7 For indole derivatives, molecules
possessing aromatic rings but no mirror symmetry and
not usually completely planar, the theoretical evidence of
localized helium atoms at aromatic rings in larger, super-
ﬂuid, helium clusters25 has been used to propose models
of helium atoms similarly localized on either side of the
aromatic portion of the molecule.8

The 4HeN -benzene calculations reported here show
low-lying excited states (≤ 9 K) for the larger clusters,
N = 3, 14. Furthermore, the spectral weights of these
low-lying states do decrease signiﬁcantly relative to the
higher-energy states when the local ˆB†-type operators
are applied. This shows that the low-energy spectral fea-
tures we observe the our calculations are due to vibra-
tional motion of helium located near the periphery of the
benzene surface, since the ˆB†-type operators speciﬁcally
de-emphasize states that are not strongly localized near
the global potential minima. In contrast to the higher-
lying localized states, it is more diﬃcult to say whether
these low-energy states would remain low-energy with in-
creasing N , since addition of more helium atoms would
be expected to signiﬁcantly change the local details of
the helium wave function in these edge regions around
the molecule. Thus, it is also more diﬃcult to conclu-
sively claim that these low-energy delocalized modes are
responsible for the experimentally observed splittings in
the zero-phonon lines.

However, with aromatic molecules of lower overall sym-
metry like the indole derivatives, it appears reasonable
that the eﬀective potential on opposite sides of the aro-
matic ring may diﬀer, due to the eﬀect of non-symmetric,
three-dimensional side chains, resulting in slightly diﬀer-
ent localized helium densities on either side of the aro-
matic ring, as proposed in Ref. 8. This suggests that
an alternative approach to interpret the splitting of zero-
phonon lines in experiments would be in the context of
impurity spectra in solids, where the impurity molecule
can be trapped in structurally inequivalent trapping sites,
giving rise to small diﬀerences in the spectral shifts of

14

the electronic origin.54 Quantitative analysis of this kind
would also require determination of accurate helium sol-
vation densities around the molecule.

In extrapolating conclusions made from small cluster
studies, whether theoretical or experimental, to explain
experimental observations made in large droplets, the key
point to consider is whether the localization induced by
the helium-aromatic molecule interaction is suﬃciently
strong such that the localized helium excitations char-
acterized here persist with increasing N . As the num-
ber of helium atoms increases, collective compressional
and surface modes of the droplet are expected to de-
velop, and the coupling to these modes are manifest in
the phonon-wing sideband in electronic spectra measured
in large droplets.3 The path integral results for benzene
in 4He39 provide evidence that the single localized he-
lium atom located on either side of the molecule near
the global potential minimum does indeed retain its lo-
calized identity in large clusters.25 This provides a strong
argument for the persistence of the single-particle-like lo-
calized states whose excitations have been characterized
here for smaller clusters (N ≤ 14). An important task
for future work is to understand how the discrete spectra
for larger polyaromatics vary with the number of helium
atoms when this is still less than a solvation shell,11 as
well as what happens to these excitations in much larger
helium clusters. A theoretical prerequisite for study of
all these excitations is now the development of accurate
trial functions for these very anisotropic aromatic sys-
tems at larger numbers of helium atoms (N > 14). This
will then allow analysis of the transition from localized
to collective helium vibrations, as well as identiﬁcation
of any persistent localized modes that may exist at an
aromatic molecular nanosubstrate.

We review the use of the path integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) methodology to the
study of ﬁnite-size quantum clusters, with particular emphasis on recent appli-
cations to pure and impurity-doped 4He clusters. We describe the principles of
PIMC, the use of the multilevel Metropolis method for sampling particle permu-
tations, and the methods used to accurately incorporate anisotropic molecule-
helium interactions into the path integral scheme. Applications to spectroscopic
studies of embedded atoms and molecules are summarized, with discussion of the
new concepts of local and nanoscale superﬂuidity that have been generated by
recent PIMC studies of the impurity-doped 4He clusters.

1. Introduction

Over the past 15 years, the path integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) method has evolved
into a uniquely powerful computational tool for the study of bulk and ﬁnite quantum
systems. In PIMC, one is interested in computing the thermal average of a quantum
observable ˆO at a given temperature T , which can be expressed with respect to the
thermal density matrix ρ(R, R′; β) = hR′|e−β ˆH|Ri:

h ˆOi = Z −1

dRdR′ ρ(R, R′; β)hR| ˆO|R′i,

(1)

Z

where R ≡ (r1, r2, . . . , rN ) is a point in the 3N −dimensional conﬁguration space
of an N -particle system, ˆH is the Hamiltonian, and β = 1/kBT . Here Z =
dR ρ(R, R; β) is the partition function. The multidimensional integral of Eq. (1)
can in principle be evaluated by standard Monte Carlo integration schemes, i.e. by
R
taking an average of hR| ˆO|R′i over the conﬁgurations {R, R′} sampled from the
probability distribution Z −1ρ(R, R′; β). However, the full density matrix of an in-
teracting N -particle quantum system is generally not known at low temperatures.
Therefore one needs to resort to the discrete representation of the Feynman path
integral formula for a low-temperature density matrix, which will be discussed in
detail in Section 2.

The ﬁnite-temperature nature of PIMC makes this a complementary approach
to zero-temperature Monte Carlo methods, such as variational Monte Carlo, or
Green’s function-based methods such as diﬀusion Monte Carlo, which are reviewed
in Chapter 1 of this volume. 1 PIMC is currently the only numerical method capable
of directly addressing ﬁnite-temperature superﬂuidity and the superﬂuid transition

in helium. In addition, unlike the zero-temperature methods, PIMC does not require
the use of a trial function, requiring as input only the particle masses, numbers, and
interaction potentials, in addition to the temperature and volume. Consequently, it
is a numerically exact technique, and is independent of the trial function bias prob-
lems that zero-temperature methods may suﬀer from. However, because PIMC pro-
vides thermodynamic averages, state-speciﬁc information is generally not available.
Although in principle the density matrix contains information on the full eigenspec-
trum of the Hamiltonian ˆH, extracting this requires the numerical inversion of a
Laplace transform. 2−4 Such inversions are known to be notoriously diﬃcult in the
presence of Monte Carlo noise. Thus, to date, path integral Monte Carlo has pro-
vided only very limited dynamical information of a direct nature. Nevertheless, it
has provided critical microscopic input into dynamical models for physical systems
in helium droplets, and in conjunction with zero-temperature, state-speciﬁc calcu-
lations for these ﬁnite helium systems, PIMC has proven to be a powerful means of
investigating the dynamic consequences of atomic scale structure of a superﬂuid. 5
Feynman ﬁrst applied the path integral approach to liquid helium in 1953, and
provided a consistent clariﬁcation of the role of Bose permutation symmetry in the
lambda transition of liquid helium. 6 In Feynman’s original treatment, the multi-
dimensional integrals of Eq. (1) were approximated analytically. In the late 1980’s,
Ceperley and Pollock subsequently devised a Monte Carlo scheme for the exact
numerical evaluation of these multidimensional integrals, in which the combined
conﬁguration and permutation spaces were eﬃciently sampled using a multilevel
Metropolis method. 7 This allowed direct quantitative application of Feynman’s
path integral approach to the superﬂuid state of helium for the ﬁrst time.

Since then, the PIMC method has been applied to provide a quantitative descrip-
tion of numerous bulk and ﬁnite bosonic systems. In addition to extensive studies
of bulk helium, PIMC has now been employed in the study of 4He/3He mixtures, 8
of helium and molecular hydrogen droplets, 5,9 and of helium and hydrogen ﬁlms on
various surfaces. 10,11 In this work, we focus on the application of PIMC to quantum
simulations of ﬁnite helium clusters, 4HeN . Since we are primarily concerned with
the bosonic isotope of helium, for the remainder of the chapter, we will denote 4He
as simply He, unless explicitly stated. The ﬁeld of helium cluster research has grown
very rapidly over recent years due to new possibilities of inserting molecular probes
and studying their properties. 12 An overview of the experimental work in this
area is provided in Chapter 9 of this volume. Accompanying this rise in experimen-
tal studies, there has been a correspondingly increased demand for complementary
theoretical study of these ﬁnite quantum systems.

The earliest PIMC simulation of pure HeN droplets, made in 1989, demonstrated
superﬂuid behavior for sizes N as small as 64. 13 This result, together with zero-
temperature calculations of the size scaling for pure cluster excitation spectra made
at that time, 15 was taken to be strong theoretical evidence that these ﬁnite-sized
clusters were indeed superﬂuid. This was later conﬁrmed experimentally, through
a series of elegant experiments with impurity-doped helium clusters. 16,17 Doped

clusters present additional technical challenges for PIMC beyond the requirements
posed by a ﬁnite cluster of pure HeN . Early PIMC work with doped clusters ad-
dressed the widely studied HeN SF6 system. 18,19 These studies showed that the
global superﬂuid fraction appeared not to be signiﬁcantly modiﬁed by introduction
of an impurity. However, it soon became apparent that interesting new local fea-
tures due to Bose exchange symmetry were present in the immediate vicinity of
an impurity. This led to the recognition that a local non-superﬂuid density could
be induced by the molecular interaction with helium. 5 PIMC simulations of doped
clusters have now been made with a variety of impurities, including OCS, HCN, ben-
zene, H2, neutral and ionic alkali atoms, and some complexes of these molecules. As
will be outlined here, these studies have revealed a broad range of properties of the
dopant as well as insight into the dopant inﬂuence on the superﬂuid properties of
the droplets. Key features that have emerged from these studies of doped droplets
are the ability to analyze superﬂuid behavior in nanoscale dimensions, to charac-
terize quantum solvation in a superﬂuid, and to probe the atomic-scale behavior of
a superﬂuid near a molecular interface.

In this review, we ﬁrst provide an overview of the Feynman path integral formal-
ism for quantum statistical thermodynamics in Section 2. Following this introduc-
tion, we discuss the PIMC implementation of the general Feynman theory, focusing
in particular on the multilevel Metropolis sampling method of Ceperley and Pol-
lock. We then review applications of the PIMC method to the study of pure helium
droplets, and of doped helium clusters containing atomic or molecular impurities in
Section 3. The analysis of superﬂuidity in ﬁnite droplets, and concepts of nanoscale
superﬂuids and local superﬂuidity are described in Section 3.4. PIMC applications
to spectroscopic studies of doped helium clusters are summarized in Section 4. We
conclude in Section 5 with a summary of open questions.

2. Theory

2.1. General formulation

Here we deal with a cluster of N He atoms doped with a single impurity. In many of
the studies made to date, the impurity is assumed to be ﬁxed at the origin without
either translational or rotational motion. Neglect of the impurity translational de-
grees of freedom is not essential, but for impurity particles which are heavy relative
to a helium atom, it is reasonable and often convenient to ignore the translational
motion of the impurity. However, the neglect of the impurity rotational degrees of
freedom should be treated with caution, especially for impurities with small prin-
cipal moments of inertia. Incorporation of the rotational motion of the impurity is
an area of current work. Hence for the present discussion we consider the following
system Hamiltonian ˆH:

where λ = ¯h2/2m4, with m4 being the helium mass. The potential energy ˆV includes
a sum of He-He pair potentials, VHe−He, and He-impurity interactions VHe−imp,
where the latter are most readily given in the molecular frame. If necessary, e.g. for
light molecules, the impurity translational degrees of freedom can be incorporated
by adding an additional term −λI ∇2
I , corresponding to the impurity center-of-mass
kinetic energy.

In the path integral approach, one uses the identity e−(β1+β2) ˆH = e−β1 ˆH e−β2 ˆH
to express the low-temperature density matrix by an integral over all possible paths,
{R, R1, R2, . . . , RM−1, R′}, with the weight for each path given by the product of
density matrices at a higher temperature T ′ = M T :

ρ(R, R′; β) =

dR1dR2 . . . dRM−1 ρ(R, R1; τ )ρ(R1, R2; τ ) . . . ρ(RM−1, R′; τ ). (2)

Z

Here τ ≡ β/M = (kBT ′)−1 constitutes the imaginary time step deﬁning the dis-
crete representation of the path integral. For a suﬃciently high temperature T ′ or,
equivalently, for a small enough time step τ , there exist several approximations to
the density matrix that are suﬃciently accurate for this factorization to be used in
numerical work. 20 The simplest of these high-temperature approximations is the
primitive approximation, which is based upon the Trotter formula: 21

ρ(Rk, Rk+1; τ ) ≈

dR′ hRk|e−τ ˆK|R′ihR′|e−τ ˆV |Rk+1i.

Z

The potential energy operator ˆV in Eq. (1) is diagonal in the position representation,

hR′|e−τ ˆV |Rk+1i = e−τ V (Rk+1)δ(R′ − Rk+1),

while the kinetic term corresponds to the free particle density matrix:
)2/4λτ .
hRk|e−τ ˆK|R′i = ρ0(Rk, R′; τ ) = (4πλτ )−3N/2e−(Rk−R

From Eqs. (2)–(5), the path integral representation for the density matrix in the
primitive approximation may be expressed as:

A single Rk is referred to as a time slice, and ri,k, the position of the ith particle

will denote time index. Eq. (6) may be viewed as a classical conﬁguration inte-
gral, with the exponent of its integrand corresponding to an energy function. The
ﬁrst term in the exponent, derived from the kinetic energy, corresponds to a spring

potential that connects beads representing the same atom at successive imaginary
times, with coupling constant (2λτ )−1. This chain of beads connected by springs
is often referred to as a polymer. 6,22 The helium-helium interaction is represented
by an inter-polymer potential that has non-zero interactions only between beads
located on diﬀerent polymers and indexed by the same imaginary time value. This
corresponds to Feynman’s original idea of mapping path integrals of a quantum sys-
tem onto interacting classical polymers, with a special form of polymer interaction
potential. 6 In the absence of kinetic contributions from the impurity, the helium-
impurity interaction acts as an additional external ﬁeld for the helium atoms, and
hence for these polymers.

The thermal density matrix ρ(R, R′; β) = hR|e−β ˆH|R′i can be expanded in
terms of the eigenvalues {En} and the corresponding eigenfunctions {φn} of the
Hamiltonian ˆH:

This is appropriate for a system of distinguishable particles under Boltzmann statis-
tics. For a Bose system such as He or para-H2, it should be symmetrized with respect
to particle exchanges. This can be done by modifying the sum in Eq. (8) to a sum
over exchange-symmetrized stationary states ˜φα only:
ρB(R, R′; β) =

˜φα(R) ˜φ∗

α(R′)e−βEα.

A symmetrized eigenfunction ˜φα(R) can be obtained by summing a stationary wave-
function of distinguishable particles, φn(PR), over all N -particle permutations P: 23

2.2. Density matrix evaluation

In order to make PIMC calculations more tractable, one wishes to use the smallest
possible number of time slices M for a given temperature T . This means that it is
essential to ﬁnd accurate high-temperature density matrices at as small a value T ′ as
possible, so that the imaginary time step τ be kept as large as possible. It has been
found that for the helium-helium interaction, the primitive approximation described
in Eqs. (3)–(5) is accurate enough at temperatures higher than ∼1000 K. 24 This
implies that a PIMC simulation at T ∼ 0.3 − 0.4 K, where the spectroscopic mea-
surements for the impurity-doped helium clusters have been performed, 25 would
require several thousands of time slices. This computational expense can be avoided

by going beyond the primitive approximation to a more sophisticated approximation
for the high-temperature density matrices. Based on the Feynman-Kac formula, 24
the high-temperature density matrix ρ(R, R′; τ ) can be approximated by a prod-
uct of the free particle propagator ρ0(R, R′; τ ) of Eq. (5) and an interaction term

The interaction term e−U(R,R
;τ ) is in turn factored into contributions deriving from
the helium-helium and helium-impurity interactions, ρHe−He and ρHe−imp, respec-
tively. For spherical interactions, one can generate a pair-product form of the exact
two-body density matrices using a matrix squaring approach discussed in detail in
Ref. 20. We use this for the helium-helium interaction, which is spherically symmet-
ric. Such helium-helium density matrices of the pair-product form have been shown
to be accurate for τ −1/kB ≥ 40 K, i.e., T ′ ≥ 40 K. 7,24 This same approach can be
used for the helium-impurity interaction when this is also isotropic. However, for
molecules the helium-impurity interaction VHe−imp(r) is in general not isotropic,
and may involve complicated three-dimensional dependencies. This can be dealt
with in several ways. One approach is to expand the helium-impurity interaction
in spherical terms and then employ pair-product forms as above. We have found
it convenient to work within the primitive approximation for the helium-impurity
interaction, which allows considerable ﬂexibility when changing impurities. The re-
quired time step for the accurate primitive helium-impurity density matrices varies,
depending on the impurity molecule involved (e.g., τ −1/kB ≥ 80 K for He-SF6 and
He-OCS, τ −1/kB ≥ 160 K for He-benzene). This must be recalibrated, e.g., by es-
tablishing converged helium densities, for every new molecule that is studied. The
same re-calibration requirement holds also for spherical expansions.

2.3. Multilevel Metropolis algorithm
For a diagonal operator ˆO in the position representation, hR| ˆO|R′i = O(R)δ(R−R′),
we need to consider only the diagonal density matrices for evaluation of its thermal
average, Eq. (1). For the diagonal density matrix, both the sum over permutations
in Eq. (11) and the multidimensional integration in Eq. (2) can be evaluated by a
sampling of discrete paths which end on a permutation of their starting positions,
i.e., s = {R0, R1, R2, · · · , RM−1, RM } with RM = PR0. This gives rise to an iso-
morphic mapping onto ring polymers. In fact, all physical quantities discussed in
this review can be estimated from a set of stochastically sampled ring polymers.

In the sampling process, it will be natural to choose the probability density

function as

πs = Z −1

ρ(Rk, Rk+1; τ ).

urations, as long as the detailed balance condition is satisﬁed for transitions between
successive conﬁgurations:

Here Ps→s′ is the transition probability from a conﬁguration s to s′. This is factor-
ized into an a priori sampling distribution Ts→s′ and an acceptance ratio As→s′ :

πsPs→s′ = πs′ Ps′→s.

Ps→s′ = Ts→s′ As→s′ .

In order to speed up convergence times in a path integral simulation, in partic-
ular one involving permutation moves, it is very important to select an appropriate
distribution function Ts→s′ for a trial move s′ from s. The most eﬃcient way of
doing this is the multilevel Metropolis algorithm developed by Pollock and Ceper-
ley. 20,24 Here one ﬁrst chooses end points of each path by sampling a permutation
P. Then the paths are bisected and the conﬁgurations at the midpoints sampled.
This process of bisection and midpoint sampling is repeated multiple times, re-
sulting in a multilevel scheme that samples whole sections of the paths in a single
step. The acceptance ratio at each level of this multilevel Markov process is set so
that the combined process of permutation and conﬁguration moves may lead to the
probability density function πs of Eq. (13). Detailed procedures are summarized as
follows: 24

(1) Initialize a conﬁguration s. Typically one starts from a classical conﬁguration,
in which all beads representing each atom are located at the same site. So each
polymer corresponds initially to a single point.

(2) Choose a time slice k randomly between 0 and M − 1 and construct a table
for trial permutation transitions between time slices k and k + n, where n = 2l
and l is the level of this path updating process. For the simulation of a He
system, l = 3 turns out to be a good choice for the permutation moves. Trial
permutations may be restricted to cyclic permutations among 2, 3, or 4 particles.
The probability for permutation transitions is proportional to

Thus the transition probability for permutational moves does not depend on the
potential energy. Note that one can explore the entire N -particle permutation
space by repeatedly sampling cyclic permutations among a small number of
particles.

the (N − p) atoms not on the cycle represented by P will not change from their
old positions. This is level 0 sampling.

(8) After attempting several hundreds or thousands of permutation moves between
times slices k and k + n, followed by the bisection procedures to update the

One can check that the multilevel bisection algorithm described here satisﬁes
the detailed balance condition in Eq. (14). Note that Ps→s′ is the total transition
probability to go through all l levels.

slices that is to be updated.

2.4. Estimators for some physical quantities

With the generalized Metropolis sampling of the permutation symmetrized density
matrix ρB(R, R; β), the thermal average of an observable ˆO diagonal in the position
representation can be estimated by taking an arithmetic average of O(R) = hR| ˆO|Ri
over the paths sampled. For instance, the helium density distribution around an
impurity molecule can be estimated by

ρ(r) =

Xk=0

i=1
X

hδ(r − ~ri,k)i.

(23)

Note that all time slices in ring polymers can be considered as equivalent. Unlike
importance-sampled diﬀusion Monte Carlo methods, the PIMC calculation of struc-
tural properties such as the density distribution does not involve any trial function
bias.

There are many ways to compute the energy in PIMC, discussed in detail in
Ref. 20. Most of the PIMC applications discussed here employ the direct estimator
obtained by directly applying the Hamiltonian operator to the density matrix in the
position space. For calculations neglecting the impurity translational and rotational
degrees of freedom, the kinetic energy average is expressed in the path integral
representation as

One of the most interesting properties of bulk and ﬁnite He systems is their
superﬂuid behavior. For bulk systems superﬂuid estimators are generally derived
from linear response theory, i.e. by considering the helium response to boundary
motion. 26 Pollock and Ceperley showed how to derive momentum density correla-
tion functions that quantify the superﬂuid response of bulk systems with periodic
boundary conditions. 7 Sindzingre et al. subsequently developed a global linear re-
sponse estimator for ﬁnite helium clusters with free boundaries. 13 This estimator
is based on the response to a rotation of continuous angular frequency, i.e. to a
classical rotation such as might be appropriate to a macroscopic droplet. Consider
the Hamiltonian in a coordinate frame rotating about an axis with frequency ω,
ˆHrot = ˆH0 − ˆL · ω,

(26)
where ˆL is the total angular momentum operator. For a classical ﬂuid, in the limit of
an inﬁnitesimally small rotation the entire ﬂuid should rotate rigidly with classical
moment of inertia Icl. But in a Bose superﬂuid, only the normal component responds
to the rotation, resulting in an eﬀective moment of inertia

Note that this is to be evaluated in the limit ω → 0, appropriate to rotation of a

Xi,k

Here the summation runs over particle i and imaginary-time slice k. The vector
quantity A is the directed total area of closed imaginary-time polymers spanned by
all N particles, e.g., Az is the projection of A on the ˆz-direction. The average size
of a single polymer is given by its thermal de Broglie wavelength Λ = (β¯h2/m)1/2.
This becomes negligible in the high-temperature limit, and thus the corresponding
superﬂuid fraction ρs/ρ goes to zero (although the projected area can remain ﬁnite
at the microscopic level). At low temperatures, when the de Broglie wavelength
becomes comparable to the inter-polymer spacing, particle exchanges cause poly-
mers to cross-link and form larger ring polymers. The projected area A increases
correspondingly and the helium system attains an appreciable superﬂuid fraction.
We discuss the application of this ﬁnite-system superﬂuid estimator in detail in
Sec. 3, together with analysis of how this can be decomposed into local contributions
for an inhomogeneous system. 5,19,27

3. Superﬂuidity and quantum solvation of atoms and molecules in

bosonic helium clusters

Spectroscopic studies of impurity-doped clusters have allowed experimental inves-
tigation of a variety of excitations in helium clusters. 12 The relevant temperature
range currently accessible is T ∼ 0.15 − 0.5 K. 25 Thus, the incorporation of Bose
symmetry is essential in simulation of these systems. In this section, we focus on
the application of ﬁnite-temperature PIMC to bosonic helium clusters. We begin
by brieﬂy reviewing studies of pure clusters in Sec. 3.1, and then focus on the more
recent work for the clusters doped with various impurities in Secs. 3.2–3.4. Secs. 3.2–
3.3 summarize the structural and energetic aspects, while Sec. 3.4 deals with the
microscopic analysis of superﬂuid properties of the doped clusters.

3.1. Pure clusters

Most of the previous theoretical studies involving pure clusters are based on zero-
temperature methods, and have focused on the cluster elementary excitation spec-
trum, which qualitatively retains the phonon-roton features characteristic of bulk
He II. Current work in this area aims to understand the physical nature of the
roton excitations. 28 Zero- and ﬁnite-temperature calculations for pure helium clus-
ters have been reviewed previously, 29 and so we shall provide only a brief outline
of the ﬁnite-temperature results here. The ﬁrst studies were made by Cleveland
et al., using the path integral molecular dynamics approach in which exchange is
neglected. 30 This allowed structural analysis, which was used to study the changes
in droplet density and diﬀuseness as a function of size. Permutation exchange sym-
metry was incorporated by Sindzingre et al. in a study of the temperature and size

dependence of the global superﬂuid fraction in ﬁnite HeN clusters. 13 These calcu-
lations employed the area estimator discussed in Sec. 2.4 and showed that a broad
transition to a predominantly superﬂuid state occurs at a temperature depressed
from the bulk superﬂuid transition temperature, in accordance with expectations
from scaling of phase transitions for ﬁnite systems. The extent of depression in-
creased as the cluster size decreased. For N = 64, the onset of the transition occurs
just below T = 2 K, and the transition appears complete at T = 0.5 K, with about
90% or more of the cluster being superﬂuid at that temperature. A qualitative ex-
amination of the relative contribution of long exchange path lengths to the density
revealed that the long exchange path contribution was largest in the interior of the
droplets.

3.2. Atomic impurities

Neutral and ionic atomic impurities constitute the simplest dopants. For ground
electronic states, the helium-impurity interatomic potential can be calculated with
fairly high accuracy using standard quantum chemistry methods, and the helium-
helium interatomic potential is well-known. Thus, within the two-body approxima-
tion, it is possible to construct accurate potential energy surfaces for the ground
electronic state. The interactions of excited electronic states with helium are, by
comparison, less well-characterized and only a few calculations of electronically
excited potential energy surfaces have been even attempted. To date, PIMC calcu-
lations have been made for the neutral alkali metal impurities Li, Na, K, 31 and for
the ionic impurity Na+. 32 In general, the solvation characteristics of each impurity
are controlled by a balance between diﬀerent energetic factors. 33,34 These include
the helium-impurity interaction strength, the helium-helium interaction strength,
the impurity kinetic energy (and thus impurity mass), and the free energy change
due to the loss of exchange energy for helium atoms adjacent to the impurity.

The He-Li, He-Na, and He-K ground state potentials typically have well depths
of ∼ 1 − 2 K, 33 smaller than the He-He well depth of ∼ 11 K. 35 By considering
these potential energy factors alone, one would qualitatively expect that the atomic
impurities would reside on the droplet surface in order to minimize the total energy.
The PIMC studies, made at T = 0.5 K, indicate that the neutral alkali impurity
species are indeed surface-attached for cluster sizes of N ≤ 300. 31 In all cases, the
perturbation on the cluster structure due to the presence of the impurity is weak.
The neutral impurity atom induces small but distinct modulations in the helium
density, starting at the surface and decaying into the interior of the droplet. While
no zero-temperature microscopic calculations of these systems have been made to
date, it is expected that this behavior would persist to lower temperatures and is
therefore also applicable to the experimental studies of these alkali-doped systems
that are made at T = 0.38 K. 36

The ionic impurity Na+ interacts much more strongly with helium and conse-
quently gives a markedly stronger structural perturbation of the local helium den-

sity. The He-Na+ well depth is 407 K, about 40 times larger than the He-He well
depth. Here the ﬁnite-temperature PIMC studies indicate that the Na+ ion resides
in the center of the cluster, and the strength and range of the He-Na+ interaction
induces a tightly packed helium “snowball” around the ion. 32 In Fig. 2a, the radial
helium density proﬁle for the He100Na+ system at T = 0.625 K is shown. This
is compared with the N = 64 radial density proﬁle around the molecular impurity
SF6, at the same temperature using an isotropic He-SF6 interaction. There is a very
strongly modulated layer structure around the Na+ ion, with a high ﬁrst coordina-
tion shell peak followed by a second peak of lower density. Similar structural features
have been seen in variational shadow function calculations for Na+ and K+ in bulk
He, 38,39 although quantitative diﬀerences exist in comparison with those results.
In the variational calculations the local angular ordering within the coordination
shells was also examined, leading to more conclusive evidence of solid-like structure
in the ﬁrst two shells. These studies indicate that there deﬁnitely exists a more
strongly layered shell structure in the helium density around an impurity ion than
around neutral atomic species, with more solid-like character. This feature can be
further explored in the imaginary-time path integral representation by examining
the permutation exchanges of helium atoms at speciﬁc locations. For the He100Na+
cluster at T = 0.8 and 1.25 K, the atoms in the ﬁrst coordination shell rarely partic-

ipated in permutations with other particles, and thus are well-localized in the PIMC
sense. In the second solvation shell, some atoms are involved in long exchanges at
the lower temperature, while in the outer third shell most atoms are involved in
long exchanges. From this, it was inferred that the third shell is superﬂuid, while
the second shell has an intermediate, temperature-dependent character. 32 Such an
analysis has been made in more quantitative detail for the molecular impurities,
which we discuss next.

3.3. Molecular impurities

Molecular impurities introduce an additional level of complexity because molecules
have internal structure and usually possess an anisotropic interaction with helium.
Especially for the larger molecules, there is a severe lack of accurate two-body
molecule-helium interaction potentials. Nevertheless, the study of molecular impu-
rities in helium clusters is currently of great interest, with an increasing number of
experiments being performed on a variety of molecules. Even with simple models
for the molecule-helium interaction, analysis of these experiments in terms of the
perturbation of the helium environment on the molecular internal degrees of free-
dom has provided much insight into the quantum ﬂuid nature of these clusters. It
is important to recall that to date, all PIMC work involving molecular impurities in
helium have not explicitly incorporated the impurity rotational kinetic energy. This
is not an essential restriction, and has been so far made for convenience rather than
for any fundamental limitations. Since zero-temperature DMC calculations have
recently shown that the helium densities around small molecules may be sensitive
to the rotational motion of the molecule, 5,40−42 it would be desirable to incor-
porate the rotational degrees of freedom in future path integral studies. Only for
the heaviest rotors can molecular rotation be justiﬁably omitted. Several studies
have also justiﬁed neglecting the translational motion of the molecular impurity, in
which case the helium atoms may be regarded as moving in the external potential
ﬁeld of the molecule in the molecular body-ﬁxed frame, given by the Hamiltonian of
Eq. (1). 5,37 The validity of this assumption can be assessed with the comparative
study of molecular delocalization as a function of molecular mass and binding en-
ergy shown in Fig. 3. 43 There, the probability of ﬁnding a molecule at some distance
r from the cluster center-of-mass is shown for a series of molecules. As expected,
the heaviest dopants such as SF6 and OCS are well-localized near the center of the
cluster, and thus it is a reasonable approximation to neglect their translational mo-
tion. On the other hand, H2 is much more delocalized throughout the interior of the
cluster, due to its comparatively smaller mass and weaker helium-impurity interac-
tion, and therefore requires that its translational motion be properly incorporated.

To date, the most extensively studied molecular impurity is the octahedral SF6
molecule. Early PIMC work on SF6 in helium clusters employed isotropic molecule-
helium interaction potentials, 18 and was later extended to include anisotropic in-

teractions. 19 The helium structure around SF6 from an isotropic calculation is
shown in Figs. 2a and 8. The anisotropic He-SF6 potential surface has a global
minimum of −84 K, 44 considerably deeper than that of the He-He interaction.
Thus, SF6 is expected to reside at the center of the cluster. This has been veriﬁed
by both zero-temperature DMC 45 and by ﬁnite-temperature PIMC calculations.
For the He64SF6 cluster in the temperature range of T = 0.3 − 0.75 K, there is an
anisotropic layering of the helium density around the SF6. Integration of the helium
density over the ﬁrst solvation shell yields about 23 atoms, independent of whether
isotropic or anisotropic interactions are employed. 5 The strength and range of the
molecule-helium interaction pins the helium density in the ﬁrst solvation shell to
a total density comparable to that of the more strongly bound HeN -Na+ system.
Detailed analysis of the helium density distribution around the molecule shows that
while the angular average of the density in the ﬁrst solvation shell is independent of
temperature below T = 1.25 K, there is a small increase in the extent of anisotropy
as the temperature is lowered. This is illustrated in Fig. 4, with a comparison of
the densities along diﬀerent molecular symmetry axes for an N = 64 cluster at
temperatures T = 0.625 K and T = 0.312 K. As the temperature is increased above
T = 1.25 K, this trend to an increasingly isotropic distribution is further modiﬁed
by the onset of evaporation of helium atoms. Evaporation begins with atoms in the
second solvation shell, is clearly evident at T = 2.5 K, and is essentially complete

The higher temperature proﬁles show consistently smaller peak values in the ﬁrst solvation shell,
indicating a decrease in the anisotropy of the distribution as temperature increases.

Since the ﬁrst experiments for doped clusters that employed SF6 as a probe
species, 46 a broad array of molecular impurities have been studied by spectro-
scopic means. 25 The infrared spectral regime has provided a particularly rich ﬁeld
of study. Vibrational spectra in the infrared at T ∼ 0.4 K show rotational ﬁne
structure in 4He droplets, but not in 3He droplets, providing evidence that quan-
tum statistics play an important role in the spectral properties of the dopant. There
is now an increasing collection of experimental data available for the rotational dy-
namics of molecules possessing varying symmetries and a range of values for the gas
phase rotational constant. To date, PIMC has been used to make theoretical stud-

ies of the linear rotors OCS 5,47 and HCN, 5 the planar aromatic molecule benzene
(C6H6), 37 the linear (HCN)3 complex, 27 and the OCS-(H2)M complex. 47 From
these studies the notion of two diﬀerent dynamical regimes has emerged, namely
that of heavy molecules such as SF6 that are characterized by gas phase rotational
constants B0 < 0.5 cm−1, and a complementary regime of lighter molecules pos-
sessing larger gas phase values of B0. 5 This division into two dynamical regimes
based on rotational constants emerges from analysis of the helium solvation density
and energetics derived from path integral calculations.

The OCS impurity lies in the regime of relatively heavy molecules, with B0 =
0.20 cm−1. The He-OCS potential has a global minimum of ∼ 64 K, 48 which is only
about two-thirds that of the He-SF6 potential. 44 It is important to consider the
anisotropy of the intermolecular potential in addition to its strength when assessing
the quantum solvation structure. In this respect the linear OCS molecule has lower
symmetry than the octahedral SF6. The minimum angular barrier for rotation of
the OCS about an axis perpendicular to the molecular axis (i.e., the angular adi-
abatic barrier for rotation) is 41.9 K. 48 This barrier is markedly higher than the
corresponding value 20.7 K for SF6, and consequently gives rise to stronger angular
modulations in the solvating density. 5 As shown in Fig. 6, PIMC calculations for
the He64OCS cluster at T = 0.312 K reveal a strongly structured helium density,
forming approximately elliptical solvation shells around the OCS impurity. The ﬁrst
shell integrates to ∼ 17 atoms. 5 Because of the axial symmetry of the He-OCS po-
tential, the density at the global minimum forms a ring around the OCS molecular
axis, consisting of about 6 helium atoms.

The benzene molecule (C6H6) also lies in the heavy regime. The benzene π-
electron character leads to a highly anisotropic interaction with helium, with two
deep, equivalent global potential minimum located on the six-fold axis of sym-
metry above and below the plane of the molecule. 37,49 A PIMC study of benzene-
doped clusters has shown a highly anisotropic helium structure around the impurity
molecule that reﬂects this six-fold symmetry. 37 The sharpest density peak is located
along the C6-axis, at the two equivalent locations of the global potential minima.
These two global density maxima are higher than the local density maxima viewed
along the in-plane directions by more than a factor of four, reﬂecting the marked
anisotropy of the He-benzene interaction potential. The extreme density anisotropy
is summarized in Fig. 2b where the dotted-dashed lines show density proﬁles along
the C6-axis and along one of the in-plane directions. Integration over any one of
the two equivalent global density maxima gives exactly one helium atom. We see an
interesting eﬀect of near complete localization of these two helium atoms located
at the two global potential minima on either side of the molecular plane. As noted
in Ref. 37, this phenomenon can be viewed as a precursor form of helium adsorp-
tion onto a molecular nanosubstrate. Extending these studies to larger polyaromatic
molecules will allow contact to be made with PIMC studies of helium adsorption
on graphite. 10

In contrast to this highly structured quantum solvation observed around the

heavier molecules such as OCS and benzene, the linear HCN molecule falls into
the light molecule regime, with a signiﬁcantly larger gas phase rotational constant.
For HCN, B0 = 1.48 cm−1. The He-HCN potential 50 is both weaker (its global
minimum is −42 K) and less anisotropic than the He-OCS potential. While there
is clearly still an ellipsoidal layering of the helium density around the HCN, within
each solvation shell there is now a noticeable lack of angular structure, in contrast
to the situation with OCS (Fig. 6). For such a light rotor, neglect of the molecular
rotational kinetic energy now becomes a more serious concern. From DMC stud-
ies assessing the eﬀect of molecular rotation, 5,42,51 the expectation here is that
the helium density will become more diﬀuse when molecular rotation is explicitly
incorporated into PIMC.

Self-assembled linear chains of polymeric (HCN)M have been detected experi-
mentally in helium droplets. 52 The helium structure around such linear chains has
recently been addressed with a study of the properties of helium droplets with up

to N = 500 atoms that contain (HCN)2 dimers and (HCN)3 trimers. 27 Like the
monomeric molecules discussed above, the HCN polymers are found to be located at
the center of the droplet and to induce a layering of the helium density. Draeger et
al. have analyzed the structure of the ﬁrst solvation shell around the linear polymer
in terms of a two-dimensional ﬁlm, estimated the eﬀective conﬁnement potential
for displacement away from the droplet center, and made calculations for vortex
formation in these droplets. 27 It has been suggested earlier that the presence of
a linear impurity species might stabilize the formation of a vortex line in helium
droplets. 53 The expectation here is that a vortex line could be pinned along the
molecular axis of a linear molecule such as HCN, or more likely, along the axis of
a linear polymeric chain such as (HCN)M . While the physics of vortices constitute
an essential feature of bulk He II, 54 and ways of producing and detecting vor-
tices during helium droplet formation have been the subject of much discussion (see
Ref. 53 and therein), no experimental evidence has been found so far for existence
of vortices in ﬁnite helium droplets. Theoretically, vortices have been shown to be
unstable in pure droplets, 55 and the situation with regard to doped droplets is still
controversial. The energy for formation of a vortex, ∆EV , is deﬁned as

∆EV = EV − E0,

(1)

where E0 is the ground state cluster energy and EV is the energy of the cluster with
a vortex line present. Within the ﬁxed-phase approximation, the PIMC estimate for
this vortex formation energy is ∼ 30 K for a He500(HCN)M cluster at T = 0.38 K,
where M = 0 − 3. 27 In this case, the vortex formation energy is found not to be
signiﬁcantly aﬀected by the presence of a linear impurity. In comparison, density
functional calculations made for a range of impurities and cluster sizes give values of
∆EV that are larger than the ﬁxed-phase PIMC estimates by a factor of 3, and that
are reduced by ∼ 5 − 10 K in the presence of an impurity. 56 An exact estimator
for the energy of a cluster in an angular momentum state m relative to m = 0
has been derived using angular momentum projection methods. 27 Application of
this estimator at T = 2.0 K indicates that the presence of an impurity actually
results in a slight increase in the vortex formation energy. More work is required
in this direction, in particular the systematic examination of the cluster size and
temperature dependence of ∆EV obtained from the angular momentum projection
estimator.

Many other complexes have now been synthesized in helium droplets. 12 Indeed,
these droplets are proving to be a remarkably versatile quantum matrix environment
for synthesis of unusual or metastable aggregates. Of particular interest from a
fundamental point of view are the complexes of OCS with molecular hydrogen, H2.
Recent spectroscopic measurements on OCS(H2)M complexes inside HeN clusters
have shown an interesting feature that has been interpreted as evidence of nanoscale
hydrogen superﬂuidity. 57 Initial PIMC studies of these systems have been carried
out 47 using accurate pair potentials of OCS with He and with H2. 48,58 Since the
H2-OCS potential surface has a similar angular modulation as that for He-OCS,

21

but a deeper minimum, the OCS molecule is expected to bind preferentially to H2
over He. Calculations for the OCS(H2)5 complex in the He39 cluster 47 showed that
approximately six helium atoms, which would normally occupy the region of the
global potential minimum in the absence of H2, are completely displaced by ﬁve
H2 molecules. These H2 molecules form a complete ring encircling the linear OCS
molecule at the region of lowest potential energy. The helium density is pushed
either to either the secondary peaks in the ﬁrst shell, or outwards from ﬁrst to
second shell region.

3.4. Exchange permutation analysis and impurity-induced

non-superﬂuidity

In addition to providing structural and energetic information, PIMC is currently the
only numerical method capable of providing information on ﬁnite-temperature su-
perﬂuidity in He systems. At high temperatures an N -body system may be described
by Boltzmann statistics, i.e. in the path integral representation, only the identity
permutation is important. At low temperatures however, permutations must be
included in the path integral representation for the thermal density matrix. In par-
ticular, for liquid helium near the lambda transition, Feynman qualitatively showed
that the presence of long exchange cycles gives rise to the sharp increase in the heat
capacity, but due to the analytical approximations made in his analysis he was not
able to correctly identify the order of the transition. 6 Further reﬁnements in this
and numerical PIMC simulations have quantitatively conﬁrmed both the transition
temperature and its order. 20

The area estimator of Eq. (30) gives a scalar value for the global superﬂuid frac-
tion ρs/ρ. This provides a complete description for homogeneous helium systems.
However, a ﬁnite cluster of nanoscale dimensions necessarily contains inhomogene-
ity deriving from the surface, and atomic and molecular dopants provide additional
sources of inhomogeneities. In this situation Eq. (30) may be interpreted as provid-
ing an estimate of the global superﬂuid fraction averaged over all sources of inhomo-
geneity. It is notable that the impurity molecule does not signiﬁcantly perturb this
global superﬂuid fraction. For neutral Na-doped clusters, the area estimator yields a
global superﬂuid fraction of about 95%, 31 consistent with the very weak perturba-
tion of the density noted earlier. For more strongly bound systems such as HeN SF6
and HeN Na+, it is found that ρs is similarly large, approaching unity for N > 100
at T = 0.625 K. 5,32 Thus to see a molecular eﬀect on superﬂuidity, one needs to
examine the local solvation structure on microscopic length scales. Here, the density
ρ is no longer uniform, particularly in the neighborhood of an inhomogeneity. Thus,
the superﬂuid fraction ρs/ρ is expected to be dependent on position. Some indirect
indications of this have also been found in analyses of helium ﬁlms. 59−61

A simple way to qualitatively estimate the local dependence of superﬂuid char-
acter is to examine the probability Πp(r) of a particle at a position r to participate
in an imaginary-time exchange cycle of length p. As discussed previously, Bose su-

Copyright c(cid:13) 2002 by World Scientiﬁc, reprinted with permission.

22

perﬂuidity is associated with the existence of exchange cycles of long p. In a pure
cluster, the single source of inhomogeneity is the cluster surface. For a pure clus-
ter, Πp≥6(r) goes to zero as the radial distance r approaches the surface. In the
presence of an impurity, the examples discussed in Secs. 3.2 and 3.3 show that
an embedded molecule can signiﬁcantly modify the total density distribution ρ(r).
Consequently one also expects changes in the local superﬂuid character. Kwon and
Whaley have systematically examined Πp(r) for helium clusters doped with a single
SF6 impurity. 19 They deﬁne a local superﬂuid density by

ρs(r) =

Πp(r)ρ(r)

(2)

N

Xp≥p′

where ρ(r) is the total density at r, and p′ is a cutoﬀ value for the permutation
cycle length. This does not account for the tensor nature of the superﬂuid response,
providing a three-dimensional anisotropic representation of a scalar, that may be
viewed as an average over the set of tensorial response functions. For a molecule
with high symmetry such as a spherical top, this will not be a serious limitation.
For linear molecules it will introduce some uncertainty. For clusters of N > 50,
most of the polymers sampled involve either one or two atoms (p = 1, 2) or many
atoms (large p). Thus in this size regime a clear cutoﬀ exists. For these sizes, Kwon
and Whaley used a value of p′ = 6. For small clusters (N < 50), a clear distinction
between short and long exchange cycles cannot be made, which implies that in the
small cluster regime a two-ﬂuid interpretation of the density cannot be applied.

For the octahedral SF6 molecule, the local superﬂuid estimator of Eq. (2) yields
an anisotropic superﬂuid solvation structure around the impurity molecule, whose
density modulations are similar to those of the total density ρ(r). The local non-
superﬂuid density ρn(r) = ρ(r) − ρs(r) does depends weakly on temperature, which
implies that ρn(r) consists of thermal contribution and a molecule-induced compo-
nent. Fig. 7 shows a three-dimensional representation of the local non-superﬂuid
distribution around the octahedral SF6 molecule. The red areas of highest non-
superﬂuid density are located at the octahedral sites of strongest binding to the
molecule, reﬂecting the origin of this as a molecule-induced non-superﬂuid. This is
in contrast to the thermal normal density of bulk He II in the Landau two-ﬂuid de-
scription of a homogeneous superﬂuid. 62 The molecule-induced density component
depends on the strength and range of the helium-impurity interaction potential,
and is expected to persist at T = 0. Detailed analysis shows that it is non-zero only
in the ﬁrst solvation layer around the molecule. 19

An analysis using the local estimator of Eq. (2) has been applied to a number
of diﬀerent molecular impurities in helium clusters, including the linear molecules
OCS and HCN, 5,47 and benzene. 37 These systems exhibit a similar layering in
both local superﬂuid density ρs(r) and local non-superﬂuid density ρn(r) around the
molecule. The non-superﬂuid density shows slightly stronger modulations, result-
ing in a weakly anisotropic local superﬂuid fraction in addition to the component
densities themselves. 5 In the more strongly bound He-OCS case, the maximum

highest values of ρn(r), to blue for the lowest values of ρn(r). The size of the ball corresponds to

of the non-superﬂuid component is roughly ∼ 50% of the total density, while for
the weakly bound He-HCN, the non-superﬂuid, or short-exchange path, component
is only ∼ 20%. We note that the molecule-induced non-superﬂuid density is also
present around an impurity possessing an isotropic interaction with helium, i.e., it is
not essential to have an anisotropic interaction. In fact the existence of a molecule-
induced non-superﬂuid density was ﬁrst seen in calculations of the SF6 molecule
with isotropic interactions potentials, summarized in Fig. 8.

Nakayama and Yamashita have pursued a similar analysis of the local superﬂuid
density for the HeN Na+ cluster, which exhibits a triple-layer structure for N =
100. 32 While they did not explicitly compute the local quantities ρs(r) or ρn(r) in
their PIMC study, they observed that the helium atoms in the ﬁrst solvation shell
(r < 4 ˚A) rarely participate in long exchanges. This observation, combined with
the pair distribution functions computed with respect to atoms in the ﬁrst shell,
led them to conclude that the ﬁrst shell is solid-like.

Fig. 8. Total, local non-superﬂuid, and local superﬂuid densities around SF6 in a N = 64 cluster
at T = 0.625 K, calculated with only the isotropic component of the SF6-He interaction potential.
The origin is set at the impurity center-of-mass. The local superﬂuid density is calculated with
the exchange path length criterion of Ref. 19.

As discussed previously, an even more anisotropic impurity-helium interaction
potential is provided by the benzene molecule. For the He39-benzene cluster at
T = 0.625 K, the two atoms corresponding to the two total density maxima localized
at the two global potential minima, undergo less than 2% permutation exchanges
with the surrounding helium. This implies that they are eﬀectively removed from
the superﬂuid, i.e., constitute a true “dead” adsorbed pair of atoms. 59−61 This
near-complete removal of individual helium atoms in the solvation shell from par-
ticipation in permutation exchanges of nearby helium atoms has not been seen for
other molecules to date. It provides an extreme case of the local non-superﬂuid den-
sity, ρn(r), in which there is no longer any partial exchange of helium atoms between
the non-superﬂuid and superﬂuid densities. These features of the helium solvation
around a benzene molecule are expected to appear also in clusters containing larger
polyaromatic molecules such as tetracene and naphthalene. A systematic analysis
of the eﬀect in planar aromatic molecules of increasing size, making the transition
from a molecular to a micron-scale substrate, would be very useful.

Recently another local estimator of superﬂuidity has been proposed that de-
composes the projected area into contributions from each local density bin. 27 This
decomposition allows the anisotropy of the response tensor to be evaluated ex-
plicitly. Application of this local estimator to the linear HCN trimer embedded in
helium droplets has conﬁrmed that the superﬂuid density is reduced in the ﬁrst sol-
vation layer, consistent with the presence of a local non-superﬂuid density induced

by the molecule-helium interaction, as ﬁrst established by Kwon and Whaley. 19
Furthermore, this new estimator shows that there is an asymmetry between the
helium response to rotation about the molecular axis, versus rotation about an axis
perpendicular to the molecular axis. Draeger et al. ﬁnd that the superﬂuid response
is reduced more for rotation about the perpendicular axes than for rotation about
the molecular axis. 27 In both cases it is less than unity, implying that there is a non-
superﬂuid component both when rotation is accompanied by variation in potential
energy, and when there is no variation in potential energy. This ﬁnding supports
the existence of a local non-superﬂuid induced by an isotropic helium-impurity in-
teraction, using the exchange path analysis of Kwon and Whaley (Fig. 8). Thus
the local non-superﬂuid is not dependent on the presence of anisotropy, but derives
primarily from the stronger attraction of helium to the molecule than to itself.

These studies of various molecules embedded in HeN clusters employing diﬀer-
ent estimators of local superﬂuidity all point to the existence of a molecule-induced
non-superﬂuid density in the ﬁrst solvation shell around a molecule. While the de-
tails of this non-superﬂuid density may be somewhat dependent on how it is deﬁned,
it is evident from the studies of OCS, benzene, and HCN polymers made to date,
that this local non-superﬂuid component is a general phenomenon to be expected
for all heavy molecules. It therefore appears to be one of the deﬁning features of
quantum solvation in a superﬂuid. The extent of exchange between non-superﬂuid
and superﬂuid densities exhibits a dependence on the strength of the helium inter-
action with the molecule. Benzene provides an interesting extreme case of negligi-
ble exchange between non-superﬂuid and superﬂuid density components, while less
anisotropic molecules such as SF6 still possess considerable exchange between local
non-superﬂuid and local superﬂuid. Thus, both the interaction strength with the
molecular impurity and the symmetry of this interaction are important. The ben-
zene example indicates that there are useful analogies with the well-known “dead”
or “inert” layer of helium adsorbed into bulk solid surfaces, which will be valuable
to pursue in future studies.

4. PIMC and the connection to cluster spectroscopy

4.1. Electronic spectra in HeN

Calculations of electronic spectra typically require accurate potential energy sur-
faces for both ground and excited electronic states. This is particularly challenging
for excitations in condensed phases. To date, theoretical work in this area has been
limited to relatively to simple systems, where the helium-impurity ground and ex-
cited state pair potentials can be computed to good accuracy using standard ab
initio electronic structure methods. Thermally-averaged electronic absorption spec-
tra for the 2P ← 2S transition have been computed for neutral alkali impurities at
T = 0.5 K, 31 using a modiﬁcation of the semi-classical Frank-Condon expression

He−imp is the adiabatic energies of the alkali atom in the 2P

pair potentials VHe−He are taken to be identical to the ground state. Thus, the
thermal absorption proﬁle I(ω) can be computed by sampling this energy diﬀerence
of Eq. (1) from a PIMC simulation. As discussed in Sec. 3.2, the neutral alkali
impurities reside on the droplet surface, and the resulting perturbation on droplet
properties is weak. The electronic lineshape is therefore most sensitive to the details
of the surface structure near the alkali atom. The PIMC calculations for neutral
Li, Na, and K on helium clusters of size N = 100 − 300 give good qualitative
agreement with experiment. The doublet structure (2P, 2P3/2 ← 2S1/2) observed
in the experimental spectra for Na and K on helium droplets 65 can be seen in the
PIMC calculations. However, while both experiment and theory show that these
transitions are shifted to the blue relative to the experimental gas phase values, the
absolute value of these shifts is in general much more diﬃcult to obtain from theory.
Due to weak spin-orbit coupling for Li, the doublet splitting is small relative to the
linewidth, and thus also diﬃcult to resolve. The PIMC absorption spectra for the
HeN Li system exhibits a weak red shift and a long tail towards the blue, both of
which are consistent with the experimental spectra. 65

4.2. Vibrational shifts in infrared spectroscopy of molecules in

HeN

The ﬁrst spectroscopic experiment made on a doped helium cluster measured the
infrared absorption spectrum of the octahedral SF6 molecule. 46 This low resolution
spectrum, obtained with a pulsed CO2 laser, revealed that the ν3 vibrations of SF6
molecule are red-shifted from the gas phase value by about 1 − 2 cm−1. They also

27

appeared to show that the three-fold degenerate absorption for these vibrational
modes is split into two peaks. The split peaks were interpreted as implying that the
SF6 molecule resides on the cluster surface where the three-fold degeneracy would
be expected to be split into parallel and perpendicular modes. However, DMC cal-
culations made at that time showed that the molecule should be located at the
cluster center. 66 This was later conﬁrmed by PIMC calculations 18 and veriﬁed
by subsequent experimental investigations. These include high resolution spectra
made with diode lasers 67 which showed a single vibrational absorption, red-shifted
by ∆ν = −1.6 cm−1 and having no splitting of the vibrational degeneracy, and anal-
ysis of ionization products of SF6-doped helium clusters. 68 Calculations of the spec-
tral shifts of these triply degenerate intramolecular ν3 vibrations of SF6 were made
with both PIMC and DMC, 18,66 using the instantaneous dipole-induced dipole
(IDID) mechanism originally proposed by Eichenauer and Le Roy 69 to calculate
the vibrational spectra of SF6 inside argon clusters. PIMC allows the calculation
of the thermally averaged spectral shift at ﬁnite temperatures, while DMC gives
the ground state, T = 0 K value of the spectral shift. Ref. 18 provides a discus-
sion of the diﬃculties in calculating spectral line shapes (and hence extracting line
widths) from a ﬁnite-temperature path integral calculation. The IDID approach is
taken because the intramolecular vibrational dependence of the He-SF6 interaction
potential is not known, and it is therefore necessary to approximate this. In the
IDID model, the origin of the spectral shift is assumed to be the dipole-dipole in-
teraction between the instantaneous dipole moment of the SF6 ν3 vibration and
the induced dipole moments of the surrounding helium atoms. The average shift
of the ν3 absorption estimated from the IDID model within PIMC calculations
are red-shifted, in agreement with experiment, but the magnitudes of the calcu-
lated shift (∆ν = −0.84 cm−1) is somewhat smaller than the experimental value
of ∆ν = −1.6 cm−1. Overall, the agreement of the spectral shift value to within a
factor of two is quite reasonable, but it is evident that for a proper understanding
of the spectral shift of SF6 inside helium, one needs to also incorporate the contri-
bution from the repulsive part of the He-SF6 interaction that is neglected in the
IDID model.

Recently Gianturco and Paesani have calculated vibrationally adiabatic He-OCS
potentials for various internal vibrational states of OCS, which allow for a more fun-
damental approach to the calculation of vibrational shifts. 70 These vibrationally
adiabatic potentials are derived by evaluating the interaction potentials as a func-
tion of both external coordinates and an internal vibrational coordinate using ab
initio electronic structure methods, and then averaging over the internal vibrational
wavefunctions. In particular, they have provided vibrationally adiabatic potentials
V00 and V11 that are averaged over the ground state and ﬁrst excited state of
the asymmetric stretching motion of the molecule, respectively. The shift of an in-
tramolecular vibrational mode inside the helium cluster can be estimated within
an adiabatic separation of the fast intramolecular vibrational mode from the slow
He-He and He-molecule degrees of freedom. 71 In this approach, the spectral shift

28

results from computing the average of the diﬀerence between V00 and V11 over the
ﬁnite-temperature ensemble sampled in the PIMC simulation. Recent PIMC calcu-
lations for He39-OCS at T = 0.3 K ﬁnd a red-shifted asymmetric vibration, with
the shift of ∆ν = −0.87(1) cm−1. 51 The sign of the shift is in agreement with
that seen in experimental measurements for OCS made in larger clusters involving
more than 1000 helium atoms at T = 0.38 K, but its magnitude is somewhat larger
than the experimental value of ∆ν = −0.557(1) cm−1. 72 Detailed analysis indicates
that these discrepancies are likely due to small errors in the vibrationally averaged
adiabatic potentials. 51

4.3. Rotational spectra of molecules embedded in HeN

The experimental observation of rotational ﬁne structure for infrared spectra of
vibrational transitions in the bosonic 4He clusters but not in the corresponding
fermionic 3He clusters at the operative temperature of T = 0.38 K, 17 led to the
conclusion that superﬂuidity is essential for observation of a free rotor-like spectrum.
This has been explained as a result of the weak coupling of molecular rotations to the
collective excitations of superﬂuid He II, compared to the much stronger coupling
to particle-hole excitations in the Fermi ﬂuid 3He. 73 Consequently, the rotational
lines are considerably broadened in the fermionic clusters, and the ﬁne structure
of rovibrational transitions is washed out. This is consistent with the results of di-
rect calculations of rotational energy levels of 4He clusters containing rotationally
excited molecules, using zero-temperature DMC-based methods. 5,40,42,74,75 These
direct calculations show that the bosonic nature of the 4He is critical in ensuring
a free rotor-like spectrum of rotational energy levels of the molecule when embed-
ded in a helium droplet. The corresponding rotational energy levels in fermionic
helium droplets have not yet been calculated, and would constitute an interesting
theoretical topic for future study. Path integral calculations have not provided any
information on the dynamical diﬀerences resulting from solvation in fermionic ver-
sus bosonic helium droplets so far, since fermionic PIMC simulations have not been
made for these systems.

A major feature of the rotational spectra of molecules in 4He droplets is the
appearance of free rotor-like spectra with increased eﬀective moments of inertia. In
principle, any helium-induced change in the molecular moment of inertia should be
directly related to a change in the global superﬂuid fraction, according to Eqs. (29)
and (30) (assuming that linear response measures are applicable to the quantized
rotation of the molecule). Furthermore, a highly anisotropic molecule would be ex-
pected to result in some anisotropy in the helium response for rotation around
diﬀerent axes, yielding anisotropy in the tensor of global superﬂuid response. 37
However, as noted earlier, the global superﬂuid estimator is relatively insensitive
to the presence of an impurity and the statistical errors mask small changes. It is
possible that for signiﬁcantly larger, and more anisotropic molecules than those the-
oretically studied to date, e.g., for the planar aromatic molecules such as tetracene

29

and phthalocyanine that have already been studied experimentally, 76−78 the global
superﬂuid response may be more aﬀected and yield information. For the relatively
small molecules and complexes studied so far however, it has proven necessary to
examine the local perturbations of the helium superﬂuidity in order to develop an
understanding of the coupling between this and the molecular rotational dynamics.
The microscopic two-ﬂuid description of the quantum solvation of molecules in
He that is provided by path integral calculations has led to a detailed analysis of
the eﬀective moments of inertia of molecules solvated in a bosonic superﬂuid, and
hence to a quantitative understanding of the eﬀective rotational constants mea-
sured in the infrared and microwave spectroscopy experiments. Since the path in-
tegral calculations carried out to date do not explicitly incorporate the molecular
rotational degrees of freedom, the connection between the path integral densities
and the molecular moments of inertia has to be made within a dynamical model.
Kwon and Whaley have proposed a quantum two-ﬂuid model for calculating the
eﬀective moment of inertia. 5,19 The main features of this model are summarized
below. As will be evident from the assumptions of this quantum two-ﬂuid model for
superﬂuid helium response to molecular rotation, it is applicable only to the regime
of heavier molecules, i.e., those possessing gas phase rotational constants less than
∼ 0.5 cm−1. Excellent agreement with spectroscopic measurements is obtained for
the two instances in which the He-molecule interaction potential is best known,
SF6 and OCS. 5 The theoretical values of rotational constant calculated from the
quantum two-ﬂuid model are 0.033 cm−1 and 0.067 cm−1, for SF6 and OCS re-
spectively, compared with the corresponding experimental values 0.034(1) cm−1
and 0.073 cm−1. Draeger et al. have recently tested this quantum two-ﬂuid model
for the linear trimer (HCN)3. 27 They also ﬁnd excellent agreement between the
predictions of the quantum two-ﬂuid model and the experimentally measured rota-
tional constant. While the HCN monomer lies in the regime of light molecules, the
trimer is suﬃciently massive to fall within the heavy regime, possessing a gas phase
rotational constant of B0 = 0.015 cm−1. 79

The quantum two-ﬂuid model of Kwon and Whaley is a microscopic two-ﬂuid
continuum theory for the spectroscopic response of a molecule rotating in super-
ﬂuid He. It is to be distinguished from the phenomenological two-ﬂuid theory of
Landau for bulk He II. 62 The Kwon and Whaley model examines the helium re-
sponse to rotation of an embedded molecule that, starting from the local two-ﬂuid
decomposition of the molecular solvation density into non-superﬂuid and superﬂuid
components. Unlike the Landau two-ﬂuid theory for bulk He II, it does not make
a two-ﬂuid decomposition of the current densities, but deals only with decompo-
sition of the helium density near an impurity on an atomic length scale, into a
non-superﬂuid component induced by the molecular interaction and the remaining
superﬂuid. This constitutes a signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the well-known phe-
nomenological theory for bulk, homogeneous He II, and the microscopic two-ﬂuid
model for molecular rotational dynamics in an inhomogeneous superﬂuid solvation
situation. For the remainder of this section we shall interchangeably use the terms

two-ﬂuid model, microscopic two-ﬂuid model, and quantum two-ﬂuid model to refer
to the Kwon/Whaley model.

The starting point for the quantum two-ﬂuid model for helium response to molec-
ular rotation is the local two-ﬂuid density decomposition of the molecular solvation
density that results from path integral calculations. As described in Sec. 3.4, con-
sistent evidence for the existence of the local non-superﬂuid density in the ﬁrst
solvation shell around the molecule, induced by a strong molecular interaction with
helium, has now been obtained from two diﬀerent estimators of the local superﬂuid
response. The second feature of the model is the assumption of adiabatic following
of some or all of the solvating helium density with the molecular rotation. Adiabatic
following means that the helium density follows the molecular rotational motion.
Quantitatively, complete adiabatic following of the helium density would imply that
when viewed in the rotating molecular frame, the helium density appears station-
ary. Thus, in the molecular frame it is independent of rotational state. This applies
to both classical and quantum descriptions of the molecular rotation. In a classical
description the helium density is analyzed as a function of continuous molecular
rotation frequency, while for a quantum description it is analyzed as a function of
quantum rotational state of the molecule.

The accuracy of the adiabatic following assumption, as well as quantiﬁcation
of the extent of adiabatic following by helium, has been the subject of several
studies by Whaley and co-workers. 5,74,80 Within a classical description of molecu-
lar rotation, Kwon et al. provided a criterion for adiabatic following, namely that
the kinetic energy of rotation associated with a particular helium density (total,
non-superﬂuid, or superﬂuid) be less than the potential energy barrier to rotation
around the molecule. 5 This criterion is applicable to densities deriving from any
number of helium atoms, and allows simple estimates using either barriers to rigid
rotation, or barriers to adiabatic motion between potential minima associated with
diﬀerent molecular orientations. Application of this criterion to the molecules OCS,
SF6 and HCN, for which the molecule-helium interaction potentials are very well
characterized, showed that for both OCS and SF6 it is energetically feasible for the
entire helium density to adiabatically follow the molecular rotation. However, for
the lighter HCN molecule, it is not energetically feasible for any density component,
whether non-superﬂuid, superﬂuid, or total, to adiabatically follow the molecular
rotation. In a classical sense, the molecular rotation is then too fast for the helium
to follow. The consequence of this lack of adiabatic following is that the helium
density distribution is more diﬀuse when viewed in the molecular frame. This can-
not be seen directly in the PIMC densities, since molecular rotation is not included
in these. However, it can be seen directly in diﬀusion Monte Carlo calculations of
excited rotational states of the molecules in He clusters. In these calculations, made
with an importance sampling algorithm for rotational degrees of freedom, 41 the
helium density (or wave function) is projected into the rotating molecular frame
and compared with the corresponding density (wave function) from a calculation
performed without molecular rotation. 5,74 Explicit analysis of the dependence on

31

rotational state can also be performed, although comparison between rotating and
non-rotating cases is already very revealing. The original application of this anal-
ysis showed that the extent of adiabatic following decreases for lighter molecules,
with the helium density in the molecular frame becoming more diﬀuse as the rota-
tional constant of the molecule increases. 74 Kwon et al. showed recently how this
comparison may be quantiﬁed by evaluation of a quality factor Q that measures
changes in the ratio of densities along directions corresponding to strong and weak
binding, as a function of molecular rotational state. 5 Complete adiabatic following
is measured by Q = 1, provided the molecular interaction potential is anisotropic.
(For an isotropic interaction with helium, adiabatic following is not applicable, and
Q ≡ 1 by deﬁnition.) Application to the series of molecules, OCS, SF6, and HCN,
shows that Q ∼ 0 for HCN, and Q ∼ 0.7 for both OCS and SF6. 80 This conﬁrms
the prediction of the energetic criterion for HCN, i.e., there is negligible adiabatic
following around this molecule. The Q-value results for the heavier molecules are
quite signiﬁcant, implying that the extent of adiabatic following is not complete,
even for the most strongly bound case of a single He atom attached to SF6. 5 So
only a fraction of the helium density can adiabatically follow the molecular rotation,
even for a heavy, strongly bound molecule.

The next stage of the quantum two-ﬂuid model is to consider the consequences
of adiabatic following for both the local non-superﬂuid and local superﬂuid density
around a dopant molecule. These two density components show very diﬀerent re-
sponse to adiabatic following, deriving essentially from the diﬀerent spatial extent
that results from their corresponding underlying exchange permutation paths. The
molecule-induced non-superﬂuid density is localized close to the molecule, within
the ﬁrst solvation layer, and is composed of very short permutation exchange paths.
In order to satisfy adiabatic following, such a localized density must rotate rigidly
with the molecule. There is no other obvious way in which a density that is spatially
localized within a few angstrom can remain constant in a rotating molecular frame.
This results in an increment of moment of inertia from the local, molecule-induced
non-superﬂuid that is given by

For the heavy molecules SF6, OCS, and the linear trimer (HCN)3, the PIMC values
for ∆In amount to 100%, 90%, and ∼ 81% of the corresponding experimentally
observed moment of inertia increments, ∆I. It is interesting that for the highly
symmetric SF6 molecule, a very similar result (∆In ∼ 98% of ∆I) is obtained from
calculations with only an isotropic interaction potential. While there is no adiabatic
following with an isotropic interaction and hence no mechanism for rigid coupling
of the non-superﬂuid helium density to the molecular rotation, the high symmetry
of the octahedral SF6 molecule nevertheless results in the integrated non-superﬂuid
density in the ﬁrst shell being very similar in anisotropic and isotropic calcula-
tions. In fact, the ﬁnding that the isotropic non-superﬂuid density could account

32

quantitatively for ∆I was obtained prior to calculations of the anisotropic local non-
superﬂuid density. 81 While this result did not have the theoretical justiﬁcation of
rigid coupling as a result of adiabatic following at that time, it was the ﬁrst indica-
tion that a local two-ﬂuid description was dynamically relevant and prompted the
application of an microscopic Andronikashvili analysis of experimental rotational
spectra for the case of OCS in He. 17

In contrast to the local non-superﬂuid density, the superﬂuid density, while also
modulated around the molecule, is not restricted on an angstrom length scale within
the quantum solvation structure. By its very deﬁnition, consisting of long exchange
paths, the superﬂuid density extends far from the molecule. Thus the equation of
continuity can applied to this density over long distances. Kwon et al. have shown
that for a classical molecular rotation, determined by a continuous frequency ω, the
condition of adiabatic following, if satisﬁed, can be combined with the equation of
continuity to eliminate the explicit time dependence of the density and to arrive at
an equation for the superﬂuid velocity: 5

∇ · [ρs(r, t)vs(r, t)] = ∇ρs(r, t) · (ω × r).

The irrotational nature of a superﬂuid may be used to replace vs by (¯h/m4)∇u(r, t),
to arrive at a second-order partial diﬀerential equation for the superﬂuid velocity
potential u(r):

(cid:17)

A similar equation was recently presented by Callegari and co-workers, 83 to-
gether with the somewhat diﬀerent assumption that the entire local solvation den-
sity is superﬂuid. Solution of these hydrodynamic equations leads to a hydrody-
namic moment of inertia increment ∆Ih that is derived from the excess ﬂuid kinetic
energy associated with the ﬂow pattern of vs. Callegari et al. solved the hydro-
dynamic equations for several linear or rod-like molecules for which the equations
become two-dimensional, using total densities derived from density functional calcu-
lations. 83 The full solution for a molecule showing true three-dimensional anisotropy
was made recently for SF6 using PIMC densities. 5 Draeger et al. have applied the
hydrodynamic treatment to the (HCN)3 trimer, using their PIMC densities and
also assuming the total density to be superﬂuid, for the purpose of comparison.
It appears that very diﬀerent results are obtained for diﬀerent molecules within
the hydrodynamic treatment. For octahedral SF6, the value of ∆Ih is small, irre-
spective of whether the total density or superﬂuid density is used as input to the
hydrodynamic calculations (6% and 9% of ∆I, respectively). For the linear (HCN)3
trimer, Draeger et al. ﬁnd an upper bound of ∆Ih ∼ 0.7∆I, when the total density
is assumed superﬂuid (∆Ih = 850 amu ˚A2, compared with an experimental value 79
of ∆I = 1240 amu ˚A2). The calculations of Callegari et al. for rod-like molecules
yielded between ∆Ih ∼ 67% and 98% of the experimentally measured increments

∆I. These studies diﬀered from those for SF6 and (HCN)3 in that input densities
were obtained from density functional calculations rather than from PIMC, in some
cases using simple estimates from pairing rules to construct interaction potentials
when no empirical or ab inito potentials were available.

The hydrodynamic treatment of the local superﬂuid density derived from PIMC
has a number of questionable aspects. 5 Firstly, the treatment of the molecular
rotation as a classical rotation characterized by a continuous frequency ω must be
reconciled with the intrinsic quantized nature of spectroscopic transitions between
quantum rotational states. The response to classical rotation necessarily gives rise
to angular momentum generation in the superﬂuid, analogous to the rotation of
bulk superﬂuid in a superleak. 84,85 Kwon et al. have calculated the angular mo-
mentum generation by absorption of a photon within a semiclassical analysis, and
shown that signiﬁcant values of ∆Ih result in large fractions of the photon angular
momentum being transferred to the superﬂuid density component. This contradicts
conclusions of a number of zero-temperature DMC-based calculations that indi-
cate there is negligible transfer of angular momentum to the ﬂuid on rotational
excitation. 40,41,74 Kwon et al. resolved this by adding quantum constraints to the
hydrodynamic formulation, and concluding that violation of these indicates invalid-
ity of the hydrodynamic contribution. This in turn may derive from lack of complete
adiabatic following, for which considerable evidence now exists, as outlined above,
or from the intrinsic lack of applicability of hydrodynamics to the motions of a
superﬂuid on the atomic length scale. An indicator of this breakdown is the fact
that the solutions to the hydrodynamic equations with density inputs of atomically
modulated helium solvation densities around an embedded molecule, show varia-
tions over length scales of 1 to 2 ˚A. 5,83 Such variations on a distance comparable to
or less than the coherence length ξ of helium imply that a hydrodynamic solution is
at its limits of validity here, at best, and should be interpreted with great caution.
The overall conclusions of the quantum two-ﬂuid model for the response of he-
lium to rotation of an embedded molecule are thus that the primary contribution
to the increased molecular moment of inertia is a rigid coupling to the local non-
superﬂuid density in the ﬁrst solvation shell. This yields 100%, 90%, and ∼ 81% of
∆I for the heavy molecules SF6, OCS, and (HCN)3, respectively. The accuracy of
these estimates is dependent on the accuracy of the underlying molecule-helium in-
teraction potentials. In contrast, there appears to be negligible contribution from the
superﬂuid, whose response must be restricted by angular momentum constraints.
This is consistent with the ﬁndings of only partial adiabatic following of the total
helium density. It appears reasonable that only the non-superﬂuid density adiabat-
ically follows the molecular rotation, while the superﬂuid density, which is deﬁned
over much longer length scales, cannot eﬀectively adiabatically follow. For heavy
molecules, this two-ﬂuid model provides a complete dynamical picture.

For light molecules such as HCN, the zero-temperature calculations have shown
that adiabatic following is questionable even for the non-superﬂuid density. Conse-
quently, in this situation the two-ﬂuid model cannot be used to estimate eﬀective

moments of inertia. At this time, the zero-temperature DMC-based direct calcula-
tions of rotational energy levels of doped clusters provide the only route to micro-
scopic theoretical understanding of spectroscopic measurements of rotational tran-
sitions for such light molecules in helium droplets. 41 This will hopefully change in
the future, when molecular rotational motions are explicitly incorporated into the
PIMC.

5. Conclusions and future directions

The path integral approach has provided a powerful theoretical tool for investigat-
ing the superﬂuid properties of ﬁnite helium droplets. Path integral Monte Carlo
calculations have shown that these systems constitute nanoscale superﬂuids and
oﬀer a unique route to probing the structure and response of a Bose superﬂuid
on a microscopic length scale. They also provide examples of inhomogeneous super-
ﬂuid density, with the unique feature that this inhomogeneous, nanoscale superﬂuid
density can be probed by molecular and atomic dopants.

The microscopic calculations show that such impurities introduce a local quan-
tum solvation structure into the otherwise smoothly varying helium density. The
numerical path integral Monte Carlo method has allowed this quantum solvation
structure in a superﬂuid to be analyzed in terms of the boson permutation exchange
properties, and conversely, the eﬀect of the molecular interaction on the superﬂuid
to be quantiﬁed. PIMC calculations show that a strongly bound impurity induces a
non-superﬂuid density in the ﬁrst solvation shell, whose extent is determined by the
strength of the molecular interaction. Similar conclusions are derived from analysis
of the permutation exchange path lengths into short, strongly localized paths, and
long, delocalized paths, and from decomposition of the linear response estimator
for global superﬂuidity. The existence of this local non-superﬂuid component in the
solvation layer around microscopic impurities therefore seems to be a general fea-
ture of molecular solvation in superﬂuid He clusters. Response of this local two-ﬂuid
density to the rotation of a molecular impurity gives rise to increments in the molec-
ular moment of inertia, but does not otherwise modify the eﬀective free rotation of
the molecule in the superﬂuid.

These path integral studies of doped helium droplets open the way to study
of several intriguing questions. One is the eﬀect of the molecular rotation on the
quantum solvation structure in the superﬂuid local environment. As noted in this
article, all PIMC studies to date have not explicitly incorporated the molecular
rotational degrees of freedom. We now know from zero-temperature calculations
of the quantum rotational excitations that the molecular rotation does result in a
smearing out of the angular anisotropy in the quantum solvation structure. 5,42,51
This implies less than perfect adiabatic following of the helium density, even in the
rotational ground state. Given the signiﬁcance of the adiabatic following assumption
for models of the helium response and hence for the analysis of rotational spectra
of doped molecules, developing a direct route to the solvation density around a

35

rotating molecule is highly desirable. This can be done by incorporating the molec-
ular rotational kinetic energy in the path integral representation. A key question
with spectroscopic implications is then how the local two-ﬂuid density decompo-
sition is modiﬁed. We noted earlier that the moment of inertia increment of the
non-superﬂuid density around SF6 is approximately independent of the anisotropy
of the interaction potential. This suggests that even if the two-ﬂuid densities are
modiﬁed with rotation, becoming less anisotropic, the eﬀective moment of inertia
of the molecule in 4He will be unchanged. This remains to be veriﬁed.

A second direction departing from the analysis of molecular solvation structure
in a superﬂuid is the investigation of localization of helium atoms and their removal
from the superﬂuid state, as a function of the binding to organic molecules of in-
creasing size. In the study of benzene, the key feature responsible for the localization
phenomenon was identiﬁed as the strong and highly anisotropic interaction of he-
lium with the π-electron system. Systematically varying the extent of the π-electron
system by going to larger planar, polyaromatic molecules will allow the transition
from a nanosubstrate to a microsubstrate that begins to mimic a bulk solid surface
to be investigated. We expect that the ”inert” layers familiar from studies of thin
ﬁlms of helium on graphite will evolve from these localized atoms, but the manner in
which this happens will depend on the role of lateral conﬁnement and permutation
exchanges in the presence of an extended π-electron system.

A third, novel direction is provided by extension of these ideas to nanoscale
clusters of molecular hydrogen, H2. In its rotational ground state, the H2 molecule
is a boson, but bulk superﬂuidity is preempted by the occurrence of the triple point
at T = 13.6 K. However, ﬁnite-size and reduced dimensionality systems are oﬀer
ways of bypassing this solidiﬁcation of hydrogen by allowing lower densities and
thereby moderating the eﬀects of strong interactions. Path integral calculations have
already been used in several instances in the search for a superﬂuid state of molecular
hydrogen. Thus, very small ﬁnite clusters of (H2)N (N ≤ 18) have been shown with
PIMC to be not only liquid-like but also to show a limited extent of superﬂuidity. 86
Two-dimensional ﬁlms of hydrogen have been shown to allow a stable superﬂuid
phase at low temperatures provided that an array of alkali atoms is co-adsorbed,
providing stabilization of a low density liquid phase. 11 Given these low-dimensional
antecedents, it appears possible that a relatively small solvating layer of hydrogen
wrapped around a molecule might also show some superﬂuid behavior. Path integral
calculations are now in progress to examine the extent of permutation exchanges in
cycles around diﬀerent axes of a linear molecule wrapped with variable numbers of
H2 molecules. 87 Such studies will provide microscopic theoretical insight into the
quantum dynamics underlying recent spectroscopic experiments showing anomalies
in the molecular moment of inertia that are consistent with a partial superﬂuid
response of the solvating hydrogen layer. 57

In summary, the path integral Monte Carlo approach provides a unique tool for
analysis of these degenerate quantum systems in ﬁnite geometries and with chem-
ically complex impurity dopants. The insights into nanoscale superﬂuid properties

that have resulted, and the interplay between physical and chemical eﬀects aﬀorded
by calculations on doped helium droplets oﬀer promise of new opportunities for
analysis and manipulation of superﬂuid at the microscopic level.

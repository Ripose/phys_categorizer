The incorporation of the Breit interaction in atomic and molecular calculations is discussed in
the framework of four-component all-electron and two-component relativistic eﬀective core potential
(RECP) formalisms. Contributions of the Breit interaction between diﬀerent core and valence shells
are studied in the Dirac-Fock approximation for the uranium, plutonium, ekathallium (Z=113),
ekalead (Z=114) and other heavy atoms. It is shown that the two-electron Breit eﬀects between the
valence electrons can be neglected for “chemical accuracy” (1 kcal/mol) of calculation of spectro-
scopic properties of systems containing superheavy elements and actinides whereas large core-core
and core-valence Breit contributions can be eﬃciently described by one-electron RECP operators.
Diﬀerent versions of the generalized RECPs with the Breit interaction taken into account are con-
structed for uranium and plutonium and tested in comparison with the corresponding all-electron
four-component calculations.

Introduction.

hD = c~α·~p + βmc2 + v ,

The Dirac Hamiltonian which accounts for relativistic eﬀects for an electron in an external potential v can be

written in the form

where α and β are Dirac matrices, c is velocity of light. The generalization of this equation to the many-electron
case is not as straightforward as is in the nonrelativistic case. For few-electron systems, the quantum electrodynamics
(QED) calculations can be usually performed [1, 2]. However, the perturbative QED approach is not applicable
in practice to many-electron systems such as heavy atoms and their compounds when correlation eﬀects are also
very important. Instead, the Hamiltonian formalism with some approximations for one- and two-electron parts is
employed. For many-electron systems, the eﬀective Hamiltonian (in which relatively small irreducible three-electron
etc. interactions are neglected) is usually written as

where Gij is an eﬀective operator which describes interaction between electrons i and j. It can be most naturally
derived from QED. In the ﬁrst QED order, this operator describes interelectronic exchange by a single virtual photon.
The problem is that the Gij operator is gauge dependent in this approximation, e.g., in Feynman gauge

As is shown in [3], operators (3) and (4) give equal mean values with one-conﬁguration wave function constructed
of one-particle solutions of eq. (1) if v(~r) is a local potential. However, it is demonstrated both theoretically and
computationally in [4, 5] that the result is gauge-dependent in a general case. Then, it was clariﬁed in [6] that the
gauge dependence remains if one goes beyond the no-virtual-pair approximation as well. It was noted in [7] that when
solving the eigenvalue problem with Hamiltonian (2), only so called ladder diagrams of a multi-photon exchange are
taken into account. When two-photon crossed diagram is also considered, the two gauges give the same result in the
leading relativistic order, O(α2) , where α≈1/137 is the ﬁne structure constant. Because the crossed diagram does
not contribute in this order in the Coulomb gauge [7], the electron-electron interaction in form (4) is usually more
appropriate for electronic structure calculations based on eq. (2).

In this paper we study the Breit interaction in the Dirac-Fock approximation. For the reason discussed below, we

will further use the low-frequency limit of eq. (4)

The terms of order of O(ω2

(cid:2)
The ﬁrst term in eq. (5) describes the instantaneous Coulomb interaction between electrons and the following two
terms correspond to the original Breit interaction (BI). The second term in eq. (5) describes instantaneous magnetic or
Gaunt interaction which is usually a dominant part of BI for an atomic system and the third term describes classical
retardation of the Coulomb interaction between electrons. Operator (2) with electron-electron interaction (5) is called
Dirac-Coulomb-Breit (DCB) Hamiltonian. If the retardation part or both the retardation and magnetic parts of BI
are neglected, one goes to the Dirac-Coulomb-Gaunt (DCG) or Dirac-Coulomb (DC) Hamiltonians, correspondingly.
ij rij) , which represent higher order retardation, are omitted in low-frequency approxi-
mation (5) for electron-electron interaction (4). This approximation is not valid for BI between negative (positronic)
and positive (electronic) energy states, when ωijc ≈ 2mc2. When low-frequency approximation (5) is applied to derive
the positive and negative energy one-particle states as solutions of the Dirac-Fock-Breit equations, the errors for the
energies are of order of O(α4) as is shown in [8]. A serious disadvantage of the high-order retardation terms is that
they lead to the non-Hermitian exchange part of the Dirac-Fock potential [8]. It is pointed out in [9] that inclusion
of higher order retardation eﬀects in calculations without self-energy terms is not reasonable because, at least, part
of these eﬀects cancels each other. From the computational point of view, the higher order retardation terms lead to
only a small correction to the cumulative BI eﬀect (e.g., see, [10]) and, if necessary, they can be taken into account
posteriori as a ﬁrst-order perturbation.

I. RESULTS OF ATOMIC DC(B)-CALCULATIONS.

In Tables I–VI, we report the results of calculations for a series of heavy elements by the self-consistent ﬁeld (SCF)
method with the DC, DCG and DCB Hamiltonians. The ﬁnite-diﬀerence (numerical) HFD code [11] was developed
[12] to take into account the Gaunt and Breit interactions. The absolute values of one-electron energies for most of
spinors of the uranium atom are decreased approximately on 0.2–0.5 % when BI is taken into account in the SCF
procedure. The largest change in one-electron energies among the spinors with the same principal quantum numbers
is observed for the p1/2 states (see Table III). The BI contribution to the one-electron energies has the opposite
sign for the 6d, 4f , 5f spinors as compared to those for other spinors. The energies of the 5f5/2 and 5f7/2 states
whose occupation numbers are changed in some of transitions between the low-lying states of the uranium atom
and its compounds are decreased by more than 1%, on 820 and 1000 cm−1, correspondingly. Similar behavior was
observed in [8] for the 4f and 5d spinors of the mercury atom. The inversion of the sign is caused by the change
in the electric part (Coulomb plus exchange) of the Dirac-Fock potential when spinors are relaxed due to the Breit
interaction [8, 13]. The diﬀerence between matrix elements of the hyperﬁne interaction in calculations with the DC,
DCG and DCB Hamiltonians takes place only due to the spinor relaxation. The retardation corrections give about
10% of the total Breit contributions to the one-electron energies. They can achieve more than 30% for the hyperﬁne
interaction and usually have the opposite sign as compared to the Gaunt corrections.

Table I demonstrates that the uranium atom has low-lying states with diﬀerent occupation numbers of the 5f shell.
Accounting for the BI contribution is especially important for transitions with the excitation of 5f electrons because
of the great contribution of BI to its one-electron energies. The BI contribution to the transition energies is up to
3000 cm−1(and sometimes is comparable with the DC transition energy). Similar situation is observed for plutonium
(Table II) and is expected for other actinides. Obviously, the cumulative eﬀect caused by BI for other calculated
atoms grows for elements of the same group with increasing the nuclear charge Z and can achieve few hundreds wave
numbers for very heavy elements (see Tables IV–VI). Nevertheless, the BI between valence electrons is decreased with
growth of Z mainly because of enlarging the average radii of the valence shells as is shown below.

II. DISADVANTAGES OF DC(B)-BASED CALCULATIONS

In the previous section, atomic ﬁnite-diﬀerence SCF calculations based on the DC, DCG and DCB Hamiltonians
are discussed. From the formal point of view, correlation calculations with these Hamiltonians can provide a very
high accuracy of physical and chemical properties for molecules containing heavy atoms. However, such calculations
are not widely used yet for such systems because of the following theoretical and technical complications [14]:

1 Too many electrons are treated explicitly in heavy-atom systems and too large basis set of Gaussians is required
for accurate description of the large number of oscillations, which valence spinors have in the presence of heavy
atoms. Because the number of two-electron integrals grows as the fourth degree of the number of basis functions,
it leads to serious complications of their calculations and, especially, of their transformation to a molecular basis.

2 When the Dirac formalism with four-component spinors is used, the number of two-electron integrals to be
computed is strongly increased as compared to the one-component (nonrelativistic or scalar-relativistic) and
two-component (spin-dependent) cases:

(a) The number of kinetically-balanced two-component (“2c”) uncontracted basis spinors required for descrip-
tion of the Small components, N 2c
L is the number of basis spinors
for the Large components; so the total number of the relativistic four-component (“4c”) basis spinors
N 4c

L and the number of calculated two-electron integrals is

where N 2c
2eInt is the number of two-electron integrals with only the large components when the Coulomb
electron–electron interaction is taken into account. Even more computational eﬀort is required when the
magnetic and retardation electron–electron interactions are taken into account. To reduce the number of
two-electron integrals, diﬀerent two-component relativistic approximations are actively developed ﬁrst of
all to be used in molecular calculations (e.g., see [15]).

and 2c (or 4c) cases) and N 2c

3 Eq. (1) as well as the Dirac-Fock equations has both negative– (positronic) and positive–energy (electronic) solu-
tions. This circumstance leads to so called “continuum dissolution” when eq. (2) is applied to electronic structure
calculations [16]. To prevent it, one can use only the positive-energy solutions for constructing many-electron
basis functions (“no–virtual–pair” approximation). The way to go beyond the no-virtual-pair approximation
is to use the normal ordered second-quantized representation of eq. (2) with respect to the “vacuum” level in
which all the negative-energy states are occupied. Evaluation of the Dirac-Fock(-Breit) bispinors is required
for separating the negative–energy and positive–energy solutions in the one-particle basis. Because the virtual
Dirac-Fock(-Breit) bispinors are not optimal for precise correlation calculations of molecules, some additional
eﬀorts can be required to generate an appropriate set of spinors for such calculations.

To avoid complications described in items 2a and 3, small components can be excluded explicitly from calculations
[15]. To reduce also the diﬃculties described in items 1 and 2b, Hamiltonian (2) can be replaced by an eﬀective
Hamiltonian

in practical applications when inner core electrons do not play an active role and, besides, the original valence spinors
can be smoothed in the heavy-atom cores. Hamiltonian (6) is written only for valence or “valence-extended” (VE)
subspace of electrons denoted by indices iv and jv (in the VE case, some outermost core shells are also treated
explicitly). UEf is an relativistic eﬀective core potential (RECP) or relativistic pseudopotential (RPP) operator that
is usually written in the radially-local (semi-local) [17] or separable form (e.g., see [18] and references). It simulates,

in particular, interactions (which can include BI, see below) of the explicitly treated VE electrons with those which
are excluded from the RECP calculations. Besides, the generalized RECP (GRECP) operator [19, 20] can be used,
which includes both the radially-local and separable terms (additionally, the GRECP method involves possibilities
of the Huzinaga-type pseudopotential [21] and other advantages, see below). In Eq. (2), hSchr is the one-electron
Schr¨odinger Hamiltonian

hSchr = −

~∇2 + V nuc .

Contrary to the four-component wave function used in DC(B) calculations, the pseudo-wave function in the (G)RECP
case can be both two- and one-component. The use of Hamiltonian (6) instead of (2) is, of course, an additional ap-
proximation and the question about its accuracy appears. As was shown both theoretically and in many calculations,
the usual accuracy of the radially-local RECP versions is within 1000–3000 cm−1for transition energies and an ap-
propriate level of accuracy is expected for other chemical and physical properties.

III. GENERALIZED RELATIVISTIC EFFECTIVE CORE POTENTIAL.

In a series of papers (see [19, 20] and references), we have introduced and developed the GRECP concept which

allows one to attain practically any desired accuracy, while requiring moderate computational eﬀorts.

The main steps of the scheme of generation of the GRECP version with the separable correction are:

1. The numerical all-electron relativistic calculation of a generator state is carried out for an atom under consid-

eration. For this purpose, we use the atomic HFDB code [11, 12].

2. The numerical pseudospinors

ϕnlj (r) are constructed of the large components ψl
nlj(r) of the outer-core (C) and
valence (V) HFDB spinors so that the innermost pseudospinors of them (for each l and j) are nodeless, the next
pseudospinors have one node, and so forth. These pseudospinors satisfy the following conditions:

where L is one more than the highest orbital angular momentum of the inner core (IC) spinors. The leading
power γ in the polynomial is typically chosen to be close to L + 1 in order to ensure a suﬃcient ejection of
the valence and outer-core electrons from the IC region. The ai coeﬃcients are determined by the following
requirements:

ϕnlj} set is orthonormalized,

• {
• y and its ﬁrst four derivatives match ψl
• y is a smooth and nodeless function, and

e

nlj and its derivatives,

•

ϕnlj ensures a suﬃciently smooth shape of the corresponding potential.

e

Rc is chosen near the extremum of the spinor so that the corresponding pseudospinor has the deﬁned above
number of nodes. In practice, the Rc radii for the diﬀerent spinors should be chosen close to each other to
generate smooth potentials.

Two of the major features of the GRECP version with the separable correction described here are generating of the
eﬀective potential components for pseudospinors which may have nodes, and addition of non-local separable terms
with projectors on the outer core pseudospinors (the second and third lines in eq. (10)) to the standard semi-local
RECP operator (the ﬁrst line in eq. (10)). Some other GRECP versions are described and discussed in papers
[19, 20, 22] in details.

e

The GRECP operator in spinor representation (10) is mainly used in our atomic calculations. The spin-orbit
representation of this operator which can be found in [19] is more eﬃcient in practice being applied to molecular
calculations. Despite the complexity of expression (10) for the GRECP operator, the calculation of its one-electron
integrals is not signiﬁcantly more expensive than that for the case of the standard radially-local RECP operator.

IV. ACCOUNTING FOR BREIT EFFECTS IN GRECP

Let us consider the contributions of BI between electrons from diﬀerent shells to the total energy of a heavy

atom [22]. The following estimate can be applied (e.g., see [23])

For an uncoupled one-electron state a one has

ha, b|(~αi·~αj)|a, bi ∼

1
c2 h(~va·~vb)i .

ha|~α|ai ∼

|h~via|

∼ αZ ∗

a ,

a is an eﬀective charge of the core that is experienced by the electron in the a-th state, Z ∗

where Z ∗
the nuclear charge, N a
Besides, h1/r12i can be estimated as h1/ri for the outermost (from a and b) one-electron state:

c is the number of core electrons with respect to the a-th state (the core radius Ra

Thus, the absolute value of BI between electrons in states a and b can be roughly estimated as

a, Z ∗

(11)

6

(12)

(13)

(14)

When eq. (6) is applied instead of eq. (2), it means neglecting (or, in some sense, freezing) the BI between the VE
electrons. In the case of a≡v and b≡v′, one has Z ∗

a,b∼1 and

|Bvv′ | ∼ α2 ≈

·10−4 a.u. ≈ 10 cm−1 .

1
2

Thus, this contribution is negligible for the “chemical accuracy” (about 350 cm−1) of calculations. This is demon-
strated in Tables VII and VIII, where we calculated the BI contributions to the total and transition energies of the
uranium atom. In these calculations we have subdivided all the electrons on the “core” and “valence” subspaces by
diﬀerent ways and the BI contributions between the valence electrons are neglected for each of such subdivisions (i.e.,
only core–core and core–valence contributions are taken into account). We have also calculated the BI contributions to
the total energy between the valence–valence, core–valence and core–core shells and have estimated them for diﬀerent
s shells applying eq. (11). The results are collected in Table IX. In this table we have calculated Z ∗
a as ha|1/r|ai and
have introduced the normalizing factors CN = 0.34 as some average multiplier for the BI contributions (“direct” plus
“exchange”) per an electron pair within the considered s shells (see the footnote to Table IX for more details). It
may be seen from Table IX that the estimates from (11) agree with the calculated values mainly within the factor of
two. The suggested estimate is expected to be substantially cruder for higher total electronic momenta.

The valence–valence contribution is usually decreased with the increase of Z. There are several reasons for such
behaviour. The expression for BI contains double integration on radial variables of the products of large and small
radial components of Dirac bispinor

where uk(r1, r2) = rk
> , r< = min[r1, r2] and r> = max[r1, r2]. For high Z radial parts of the large and small
components of the valence spinors have a number of oscillations, which usually do not coincide. It leads to oscillations
c (r)·r2 (see Fig. 1) and large cancellation in integral (12) as compared to the case of integrating
in the products ψl
over the amplitude of the integrant (see Table IX):

(cid:12)
(cid:12)

In particular, it also means that the “incompensated” BI contribution between the valence electrons is mainly taken in
the valence region. As one can see from Fig. 1, the absolute value of the rψl
c (r) is decreased with the increase
of Z. It may be easily understood when the kinetic balance condition is applied to derive the small components from
the large ones in the valence region:

(cid:19)

(cid:2)

(cid:3)

The atomic radius is increased with the increase of Z and, thus, the large components of the valence spinors become
smaller and smoother. It leads to the decrease of the small components in accord to eq. (14).

The core electrons can be considered as frozen when studying majority of physical-chemical properties and processes
of practical interest. Since they usually form closed shells in calculations, the total contribution of the direct part of
BI between the core and valence electrons is equal to zero and only the exchange part of this interaction gives nonzero
contribution. For the innermost 1s-shell (a≡c) of a heavy atom, one has Z ∗
a∼Z∼100 by the order of magnitude and

|Bcv| ∼ α2·100 ≈

·10−2 a.u. ≈ 1000 cm−1 ,

2

that is quite essential for calculations on the level of “chemical accuracy”. (We found in the present calculations
that contribution from the exchange interaction is usually larger than the direct one in the cases of pairs of spinors
(ns1/2, ms1/2); (ns1/2, mp1/2); (ns1/2, mp3/2); (np1/2, mp1/2); (np1/2, md3/2) and smaller in the cases of pairs of
spinors (ns1/2, md3/2); (ns1/2, md5/2); (ns1/2, mf5/2); (ns1/2, mf7/2); (np1/2, mp3/2); (np1/2, md5/2); (np1/2, mf7/2);
(np3/2, md3/2); (np3/2, mf5/2); (np3/2, mf7/2).) Therefore, one can just take into account the Bcv contributions (and
neglect the Bvv′ terms) when generating (G)RECPs with only valence electrons treated explicitly, where index c

7

runs over the core electrons only. The latter are explicitly excluded from the (G)RECP calculations, therefore, the
eﬀective operator for Bcv acting on the valence shells has the same spin-angular dependence as the conventional
(For higher accuracy, GRECP can be used, which, besides, can eﬃciently treat other
radially-local RECP has.
QED eﬀects even for highly charged ions of heavy-element systems.) Thus, BI can be taken into account directly
when the HFDB calculations are performed (see item 1 in the previous section) to generate valence bispinors and
their one-electron energies, but in the procedure of inversion of the two-component HF equations for generating the
(G)RECP components (see item 3 in the previous section), the conventional interelectronic Coulomb interaction can
be used instead of the Coulomb-Breit one. Afterwards, one should consider only the Coulomb interaction between
the explicitly treated electrons in the correlation (G)RECP calculations. In principle, the errors due to neglecting BI
between the VE electrons (as well as the errors in reproducing the interelectronic Coulomb interaction due to spinor
smoothing) can be compensated with good accuracy by the term-splitting GRECP correction [19, 20]. Alternatively,
the procedure of restoration of proper shapes for the four-component VE spinors in the heavy-atom cores [24, 25]
after the molecular GRECP calculation can be applied, then both BI between the VE electrons and the proper
interelectronic Coulomb interaction are directly taken into account with the restored wave function.

The Breit interaction for both the core electrons, Bcc′, can be of the same order of magnitude as the Coulomb
interaction between them. However, Bcc′ does not contribute to “diﬀerential” (valence) properties directly, whereas
its indirect contribution can be easily taken into account with the help of the (G)RECP technique.

V. RESULTS OF THE GRECP CALCULATIONS

In the given section we consider accounting for BI by the GRECP method only for actinides for which the Breit
eﬀects can attain a few thousands wave numbers even to the energies of lowest-lying electronic excitations. Accounting
for BI in diﬀerent RECP and GRECP versions for superheavy elements and actinides will be considered in details
in our forthcoming paper [26]. For the uranium and plutonium atoms we constructed diﬀerent 24– and 26–electrons
GRECPs, correspondingly, which eﬀectively account for the Breit eﬀects. The GRECP(f 3) and GRECP(f 2) for the
uranium atom were constructed using the generator states with the occupation numbers of the 5f -shell equal to 3
and 2. In the case of the plutonium atom the conﬁgurations with the occupation numbers of the 5f -shell equal to 6
and 5 were used, respectively. The results of the GRECP/SCF calculations as compared to those of all-electron HFDB
calculations are presented in Tables I and II.

The errors of calculations with these GRECPs can be collected into two groups. The errors for transitions without
the change in the occupation number of the 5f shell are rather small. The errors for transitions with the change in
the occupation number of this shell can achieve few thousand wave numbers. The latter errors have a systematic
nature and are mainly connected with two facts: (a) the 5f shell of uranium and plutonium is described with the help
of nodeless pseudospinors in the present GRECP versions and (b) the relaxation of the [Xe 4f 14]-like core shells is
not taken into account since they are excluded from the GRECP calculations explicitly. These errors can be reduced
signiﬁcantly if one includes the 4f 145s25p6 electrons in the calculations for uranium and plutonium explicitly. Another
way is to apply the self-consistent (SfC) GRECP version [19, 27]. In the SfC GRECP case, the circumstance is taken
into account that the GRECPs generated for diﬀerent occupation numbers of the outermost core shell(s) (N occ
in
5f
our case) are somewhat distinguished due to above mentioned reasons (see [19, 22] for more details). The dependence
on N occ
is introduced explicitly to the SfC GRECP operators, which are constructed for uranium and plutonium on
5f
the basis of the above generated GRECPs. As it can be seen from Tables I and II, the SfC GRECPs allow one to
increase the accuracy of the calculations without extension of the space of explicitly treated electrons up to an order
of magnitude and more.

a The magnetic moment µN and spin I for the Eka-thallium nucleus were taken as those for Thallium. The presented results
can be easily recalculated as only the proper values of µN and I are known because they just include the µN /I coeﬃcient.

(a) The values obtained with eq. (13) instead of eq. (12) are in brackets.
(b) The normalizing coeﬃcient, cN = 0.34, is calculated as some average value for the BI contributions within the considered
s-shells.
(c) The additional factor, 2.7, to cN appears due to the fact only the exchange (KB) terms of BI between four electron pairs
from diﬀerent shells, ns2 and ms2 (n 6= m), are considered, whereas both the direct (JB) and exchange (KB) BI terms
between the only one electron pair contribute in the case of the same shell, ns2. Taking into account that |KB| ≈ 2 · |JB| (this
expression is exact in the case n = m), one goes to the value 8/3 ≈ 2.7.

In this article we present a caracterization of the vibrational spectrum of the H+

5 molecule using
the correlation function quantum Monte Carlo (CFQMC) method and a genetic algorithm study of
the topology of the potential energy surface used in this work. The vibrational modes associated
with the H+
3 -H2 torsion and stretching posses very ﬂat minima. As a consequence the fundamental
frequencies corresponding to these modes are poorly described in the harmonic approximation. The
vibrational frequencies obtained in this work are in good agreement with the available experimental
data as well as other computational methods found in literature. In our genetic algorithm study of
the potential energy surface using cartesian coordinates we have found some unexpected minima. A
careful analysis shows that some of these minima are described by the same curviliniar coordinates
in which the potential is described. However, they represent nonequivalent molecular geometries.

INTRODUCTION

The presence of a molecular or atomic ion in a H2 atmosphere results in the formation of hydrogen ionic clusters
X+(H2)n. Properties of these clusters, such as solvation-shell distributions [1, 2], binding energies [3, 4, 5], and
vibrational spectrum [5, 6], have been theoretically investigated for a large variety of ionic cores X+.

The H2 units are connected to the core mainly by means of monopole/induced-dipole interactions, although there is
some charge transfer from the H2 units in the ﬁrst solvation shell to the positive center. As a consequence of this kind
of interaction, binding energies lie on the range of 3-10 kcal/mol [7, 8, 9] that is not enough to destroy the molecular
identity of each H2 unit. On the other hand, these binding energies are enough large to make the hydrogen clusters
potentially useful in storage of hydrogen fuel, by taking advantage of the cluster formation in the positive-charged
sites of adequate crystalline materials [10, 11].

The ﬁrst species of the homogeneous series H+

5 , is an atypical hydrogen cluster [12]. Its electronic
properties does not ﬁt in those of the large members of the series [2, 6]. As Ohta et al. have recently shown [12], one
main reason for such anomalous behavior is the isomerization process

3 (H2)n, the H+

which take places even for very low temperatures.

Since its detection in 1962 [13], many experimental studies of dissociation energies and thermochemical properties of
the H+
n clusters have been performed [3, 14, 15, 16]. For the purpose of the present work, the investigations performed
by Okumura et al [14] using infrared vibrational predissociation spectroscopy are particularly relevant. They observed
the broad and structureless vibrational bands corresponding to the H2 and the H+
3 units into the (H2)n ionic clusters
for n = 1-6 and analyzed the dependence of the shift of these vibrations with the size of the cluster. A similar approach
was latter used by Bae [17].

Numerous ab initio calculations have been carried out [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 11, 12, 15, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 26]
aiming to determine their equilibrium structures, low-lying stationary points and dissociation energies. A very detailed
ab initio investigation of the H+
5 cluster was carried out by Yamaguchi et al [3]. They revealed a quite complicated
structure of the interaction potential: ten distinct stationary points were located. Their high-level calculations
predicted a C2v structure as the global minimum. ˇSpirko et al.

its corresponding vibrational spectrum using the multi-reference conﬁguration interaction (MR-CI) methodology
[25, 26, 27]. Besides these works there are only a few theoretical papers dedicated to the infrared spectrum of H+
5 and
they are all retricted to the harmonic frequencies [3, 5, 11, 21, 22]. A recent work by Barbatti and Chaer Nascimento
examined in some depth the vibrational spectra of H+
2n+1 using the VSCF methodology [6]. As mentioned above, in
addition to the scarce theoretical data only the experimental results of Okumura [14] and Bae [17] are available for
the vibrational spectrum of this system. Therefore a more complete caracterization of this system is warranted. The
focus of this work is to provide a detailed description of the vibrational spectrum of H+

studied the potential energy surface of H+

A full description of the vibrational spectrum of H+

5 needs to take into account nine degrees of freedom. The
computational eﬀort in the traditional variational methods that rely on integration using normal quadratures is
prohibitive. One of the alternatives to overcome such shortcoming is the use of Monte Carlo methods to calculate the
multidimensional integrals which appear in time independent problems, [28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33] which do not present
the same limitations of the variational methods. This method has been applied successfully for the computation of

the vibrational and ro-vibrational spectra of triatomic and tetratomic molecules [30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38]. In
this work we used the CFQMC methodology to obtain the vibrational states of the H+
5 molecule. We also study the
PES used in this work using the genetic algorithm[49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54]. This article is organized as follows. A short
description of CFQMC methodology and of the genetic algorithm is given in the next section. Sec. III is devoted to
the presentation of the results, and in sec. IV the discussion and concluding remarks are presented.

II. METHODOLOGY

A. Correlation Function Quantum Monte Carlo

We start from the Born-Oppenheimer nuclear Hamiltonian of a molecular system (in the center-of-mass reference

frame)

where R is the vector of the coordinates of all particles of the system, V (R) is the potential energy of the nuclei. The
vibrational energy levels of the system will be then computed by solving the eigenvalue problem:

HΦi(R) = EiΦi(R),
(3)
where Ei and Φi(R) are the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of H. Given a trial basis set of m known functions fi(R)
we can deﬁne the following generalized eigenvalue problem

where dk is the kth eigenvector and Λk its associated eigenvalue, and

are the overlap and Hamiltonian matrix elements associated with the basis set. The matrix elements deﬁned in
Eq.(5) are evaluated using Monte Carlo integration techniques. The only diﬀerence of this method and the traditional
variational methods is the use of Monte Carlo to compute the integrals. Of course an accurate spectra will depend on
the quality of the basis set {fi(R)}. In this work we use the basis set of reference [30]. Namely, for the ground state

ν = |ri − rj |0 the equilibrium
with ∆Sν = Sν − S0
distance between atoms i and j. The variational parameters Aνµ are optimized in order to minimize the variational
energy or its variance. The trial functions for the excited states are given by

ν , and Sν = |ri − rj| the distance between atoms i and j, and S0

This basis set was applied successfully in the study of vibrational spectra of 2-, 3- and 4-atom molecules [28, 30, 31,
32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38]. An improvement to this methodology is the use of the diﬀusion Monte Carlo techniques
to “project” out the excited state spectrum. We restricted ourselves to the variational implementation of the method
in order to have a comparison in the same footing of this technique with the VSCF, which is also a variational based
method.

Another important aspect related to the accuracy of the CFQMC is the quality of the potential energy surface
(PES) describing the motion of the nuclei. In this work the PES of ˇSpirko et al.
[26] ﬁtted to MR-CI all-electron
computations at 110 diﬀerent conﬁgurations of the nuclei was used. A set of curvilinear coordinates was used to
facilitate the computation of the vibrational spectrum . The purpose of the CFQMC calculations is twofold. First,
to show that the method can be applied to compute the spectrum of a 5-atom molecule. Second, to determine the
accuracy of the PES of ref. [26].

In our genetic algorithm the population is coded in a binary discrete cube named A, with l × m × n bits. The
elements of A, aijk, are either 0 or 1, with i, j, k integers numbers 1 ≤ i ≤ l, 1 ≤ j ≤ m, 1 ≤ k ≤ n. The label i refers
to the component i of the gene j of the individual k. Therefore, A represents a population of n individuals, each one
of them have a genetic code with m genes. Each gene is a binary string with l bits.

The genetic code of the individual k is given by

deﬁne the real search space for each parameter, we transform

coeﬃcients that characterize the individual k. With this we deﬁne the ﬁtness of a phenotype k (set of coordinates)

where Sk is the energy given by the SEP for this phenotype, and Smax is the worst individual in the population.

We use the most common operators: selection, recombination and mutation. The selection operator normalize the

vector Sk

that represents the probability of each individual been selected for a recombination through a roulette spinning. For
the purpose of this work we selected n/2 individuals (parents) that will generate, through the recombination operator,
n/2 new individuals (oﬀsprings). So, to make a new generation we joint the n/2 old strings (parents) with n/2 new
strings (oﬀsprings) in order to maintain the population with ﬁxed number n. The recombination operator is a cross-
over operator that recombine the binary string of each gene j of two random selected individuals to form two new
individuals. In this work we use a two random point cross-over.

The mutation operator ﬂip Nmut random selected bits in a population. We choose Nmut to make the probability

of change of a given bit equal to 0.01 per cent. So, in a population of l × m × n bits, we make

where q is the probability of change of one bit.

An elitist strategy is used. It consists of copying an arbitrary number Nel of the best individual on the population

in the next generation. It warrants that this individual will not be extinguished.

We found a large number of acceptable solutions. The set of all solutions is the deﬁnition of search space (Γ).
The length of Γ is deﬁned by the number m of coeﬃcients and the length l of the binary codiﬁcation. Each one of
the 12 coeﬃcients (coordinates), that deﬁne the individual k, can assume 2l distinct values. So, an individual in the
population is only one possibility among 2l×m. This value deﬁnes the length of Γ. The length of Γ describes the
number of digits that are used to express a real value ajk and shows the minimal diﬀerence between two possible
values of ajk. Being each coeﬃcient deﬁned on an arbitrary interval δj, the precision of the coeﬃcient ajk is

If we do not have any information about the order of magnitude of the ajk values, we must choose the δj’s intervals
such that they cover the greatest number of values. However, after some generations, we obtained more precise
information about the order of magnitude of each coordinate ajk. In order to improve the performance of a standard
genetic algorithm (GA), we include in our technique the concept of dynamic search space. It consist in the use of
information of past generations to determine the length and precision of the search space for the next generations. For
the ﬁrst generations, when we have few information about the magnitude of the coordinates, we do not need many
digits to represent a real number ajk, that is, we use a low precision codiﬁcation given by a low value of l. In this way,
we make Γ a “small” search space and the GA can ﬁnd the regions of acceptable solutions faster. Once found some of
these regions we can redeﬁne the δj’s intervals and rise the precision rising the length of binary codiﬁcation l. After
extensive trials of the parameters values we take m = 12, n = 100, q = 0, 01 and Nel = 10. Beside that, we always
start the GA with a random population deﬁned in the initial intervals δj = [amin
] = [−10, 10] and set the initial
value for the length of the binary codiﬁcation l = 12. In this way we had a search space of length 2l×m = 212×12 = 2144
211 ≃ 49 × 10−4. After 1000 generations we redeﬁne l = l + 4
and the minimal diﬀerence of two possible values of ajk is 10
j × 10−1 and ajbest is the ﬁtest individual
and δj = [amin
j
in the population found along the last 1000 generations. We set 10000 generations for each run of the GA. It should
be pointed out that the algorithm is very robust and works properly with an wide range of these parameters.

III. RESULTS

For well-behaved systems a ﬁrst, usually good, description of the fundamental vibrational frequencies is the harmonic
approximation. In Table I we present the harmonic frequencies corresponding to the PES of ref.
[26], used in our
CFQMC computations, together with those obtained at MP2/6-311G(d,3p) level as the ﬁrst step in the VSCF
methodology, the ones obtained by Prosmiti et al. using the QCISD(T)/cc-PVQZ [22], and the CCSD(T)/aug-
cc-pVTZ of Prosmiti et al [5]. The results are in reasonable agreement with each other. The largest discrepancy
is observed in the normal mode corresponding to the second skeletal motion. Whereas the value obtained using
[26] is 1660 cm−1, the frequencies obtained using the MP2-VSCF, the QCISD(T)/cc-PVQZ and
the PES of ref.
the CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVTZ are 1201, 1170, and 1174 cm−1, respectively. This diﬀerence may be due to either the
diﬀerence in the levels of computation, or to the ﬁtting of the PES itself. Unfortunately, in ref. [26] the frequencies
in the harmonic approximation are not presented and this question may not be uniquely answered. To gauge the
validity of the harmonic approximation one must include the anharmonic eﬀects. These eﬀects were considered at the
CFQMC level of computation.

In Table II we consider the anharmonic eﬀects at the CFQMC(VMC) level of calculation. For comparison, the
results of ˇSpirko et al.
[26] methodology and some available experimental results are also included. As mentioned
above, the computation of the spectra was performed using the CFQMC method in the variational form. The basis
set consisted of 220 basis functions and the parameters of the wave function used in our calculations were adjusted
to minimize the energy of the ground state and the ﬁrst nine excited states. As one can see, there is a reasonable
agreement between all the computations. In particular, the results for the 8th and 9th states obtained in reference
[26], which correspond to the H+
3 symmetric stretching and the H2 stretching motions, are in good agreement with the
experimental results of ref. [14]. The CFQMC results diﬀer a little and they are closer to the values of the frequencies
of the H2 and H+
5 are shifted in the right
direction the shifts are much smaller than the ones predicted by the experiment.

complex and the one corresponding to the H2 stretching motion is red-shifted. However, the shifts predicted by
the CFQMC are much smaller than the ones predicted by the harmonic approximation, the experiment and the
MP2-VSCF computations. This diﬀerence may be due to the coordinates used to ﬁt the PES used in the CFQMC
computations. This PES uses a set of curvilinear coordinates [26] which are ill-deﬁned as two completely diﬀerent
and non-equivalent set of conﬁgurations of the ﬁve atoms correspond to the same set of curvilinear coordinates. In
[26], the computations are performed
the case of the harmonic approximation or in the original calculations of ref.
close to the minimum and this ill-deﬁnition of the coordinates do not aﬀect the ﬁnal frequencies. In the case of the
CFQMC the integral is evaluated in the whole space, therefore, making the results more susceptible to the choice of
coordinates used to describe the PES. Nevertheless, our calculations seem to be describing the stretching motion of
the H2 and the symmetric stretching of H+

3 as independent of all the other vibrational modes.

The CFQMC results are limited by the quality of the PES but has the advantage that one can compute the
full spectrum, limited of course by the size of the basis set. In FIG. 2 we present the results of all the vibrational
frequencies obtained in our CFQMC up to 5000 cm−1. The lines are broadened by 30cm−1. The full arrows indicate the

fundamental frequencies as obtained by our CFQMC computations, while the dotted arrows indicate the experimental
results [14]. The experimental results fall in overtones of our computed results rather than fundamental frequencies.
Because of the disagreement between the CFQMC computed frequencies of the H2 stretch and the symmetric
stretching H+
5 , with the experiment and other computations we decided to perform an additional study of the
topology of the PES used in this work. We decided to search for other minima besides the accepted C2v minimum.
This search is performed with the genetic algorithm which has been demonstrated to be a very robust method for
global minimum search.

3 in H+

The inital population was completely random and after a few generations we observed the diﬀerent minima (local
and global). Fig. 3a shows two candidates for the global minimum. The energies of the two minima are identical.
Further analysis shows that in the curvilinear coordinates in which the potential is deﬁned they are identical minima.
Based on the minima of Fig. 3a we started a new population and run the program for a few more generations. The
minima of Fig. 3a are again among the lowest energy structures. However, a new lower energy minimum is found.
This minimum is displayed on Fig. 3b. As one can see this candidate for global minimum is a conﬁguration in which
the H2 and the H+
3 molecules appear as not bound. This explains why the CFQMC computations frequencies of
the H2 stretch and the symmetric stretching H+
3 modes are very close to their free values. The CFMQC integration
samples conﬁguration in the whole space and they will include the structure of Fig. 3b. The same does not happen
with the harmonic frequencies as they were computed near the accepted C2v global minimum.

IV. CONCLUSION

We have obtained the vibrational energies of the H+

5 cluster in the harmonic approximation and by using the
correlation function quantum Monte Carlo (CFQMC) methodology. The lowest frequencies of the H+
5 are not well
described in the harmonic approximation due to the ﬂatness of the potential energy surface of the complex. The only
available experimental data for this system are the frequencies of the stretching motion of the H2 and the symmetric
stretch of H+
5 conplex. These frequencies are red- and blue-
shifted when compared to these frequencies in the free molecules. We have seen that the shifts using CFQMC are
smaller than the shifts obtained by the harmonic approximation and the experiment.

3 obtained by IR predissociation experiments in the H+

Our genetic algorithm search of a global minimum revealed two interesting facts about the PES of ref. [26]. First,
their choice of curvilinear coordinates is ill-deﬁned, non-equivalent conﬁguration in cartesian coordinate have identical
curvilinear coordinates. Second, and most important, the global minimum is a conﬁguration in which the H2 and H+
3
molecules are not bound. This explains the small values of the shifts of the frequencies of the stretching motion of
the H2 and the symmetric stretch of H+

3 when compared to their values in the free molecules.

In conclusion, our CFQMC and genetic algorith study of the PES of ref. [26] shows a good agreement with other
computations and the available experimental data. The diﬀerences are explained in terms of the deﬁnition of the
curvilinear coordinates used in the deﬁnition of the PES. As a future work we are proposing to reparametrize the
PES in more appropriate coordinates with additional CFQMC computations.

We perform systematic molecular dynamics simulations of water conﬁned between two nanoscale
plates at T = 300 K. We investigate the eﬀect of pressure (−0.15 GPa ≤ P ≤ 0.2 GPa) and
plate separation (0.4 nm ≤ d ≤ 1.6 nm) on the phase behavior of water when the plates are
either hydrophobic or hydrophilic. When water is conﬁned between hydrophobic plates, capillary
evaporation occurs between the plates at low enough P . The threshold value of d at which this
transition occurs decreases with P (e.g., 1.6 nm at P ≈ −0.05 GPa; 0.5 nm at P ≈ 0.1 GPa),
until, at high P , no capillary evaporation occurs. For d ≈ 0.6 nm and P ≥ 0.1 GPa, the system
crystallizes into a bilayer ice. A P − d phase diagram showing the vapor, liquid, and bilayer ice
phases is proposed. When water is conﬁned by hydrophilic (hydroxylated silica) plates, it remains
in the liquid phase at all P and d studied. Interestingly, we observe, for this case, that even at
the P at which bulk water cavitates, the conﬁned water remains in the liquid state. We also study
systematically the state of hydration at diﬀerent P for both kinds of plates. For the range of
conditions studied here, we ﬁnd that in the presence of hydrophobic plates the eﬀect of P is to
enhance water structure and to push water molecules toward the plates. The average orientation of
water molecules next to the hydrophobic plates does not change upon pressurization. In contrast, in
the presence of hydrophilic plates, water structure is insensitive to P . Hence, our results suggest that
upon pressurization, hydrophobic plates behave as ‘soft’ surfaces (in the sense of accommodating
pressure-dependent changes in water structure) while hydrophilic walls behave as ‘hard’ surfaces.

INTRODUCTION

Conﬁning geometries that contain thin water ﬁlms are
common in biology, geology and engineering. Examples
include ion channels [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], mesoscopic sur-
factant assemblies [7, 8], mineral inclusions [9], zeolites
[10], and microﬂuidic technologies [11]. Understanding
the changes in water structure, dynamics and thermo-
dynamics due to interactions with conﬁning surfaces is
therefore of interest in a wide variety of scientiﬁc prob-
lems and technical applications, such as the inhibition of
corrosion [12], heterogeneous catalysis, the design of su-
perhydrophobic surfaces [13], the ascent of sap in plants
[9], the function of biological membranes [14], and the
development of ‘lab on a chip’ technologies [15].

The behavior of water near hydrophobic surfaces has
attracted considerable attention, both on account of the
intrinsic scientiﬁc interest of the thermodynamic prob-
lem (e.g., [16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26]), as
well as its relevance to water permeation through mem-
brane channels [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 27] and carbon nanotubes
[28, 29], micelle formation [20, 30], and the amphiphatic-
ity of membrane proteins [14, 31, 32]. Hydrophobic in-
teractions are also important in phase transfer catalysis
[33], chemical self-assembly of macroscopic objects [34],
and capillary evaporation [35, 36, 37].

More than thirty years ago, Stillinger [23] argued that

when a non-polar solute is suﬃciently large, the water-
solute interface resembles that between water and its
own vapor. Lum et al.
[21] proposed a theoretical ap-
proach to describe the crossover between the solvation
of small and large hydrophobic objects. Bulk thermo-
dynamics and entropic contributions to the free energy
Interfa-
of solvation are dominant in the former case.
cial thermodynamics and enthalpic contributions to sol-
vation free energy play a key role in the latter case.
The crossover length scale between these two regimes,
1 nm at ambient conditions, is a sensitive function
≈
of pressure and the presence of co-solutes [38]. From
a microscopic point of view, this length scale is related
to the diﬀerent manner in which water molecules ar-
range around solutes of diﬀerent sizes. In the presence of
small hydrophobic solutes, water molecules rearrange in
such a way that the solutes can be accommodated into
water’s hydrogen-bond (HB) network. Thus, small hy-
drophobic solutes are caged in clathrate-like structures
[39, 40, 41] with HB vectors (deﬁned as the four tetra-
hedral vectors pointing outward from the oxygen atom
of each water molecule along the two oxygen-hydrogen
bond donor, and the two “lone pair electrons” acceptor
directions) avoiding pointing toward the non-polar so-
lute. As the solute size increases (to
1 nm at ambient
conditions) [42, 43, 44, 45], such clathrate-like structure
cannot be maintained: HBs break, inducing a restruc-

≈

turing of the HB network.
In this case, the hydration
structure shows an orientational inversion with respect
to the clathrate-like structure, with HBs pointing toward
the solute [42, 43, 46, 47, 48].

When two hydrophobic surfaces approach each other,
a conﬁned water ﬁlm can be thermodynamically destabi-
lized with respect to the vapor at small enough separa-
tions [21, 24, 35, 36, 49]. A plausible interpretation of the
experimentally observed long-ranged attractions between
hydrophobic surfaces (e.g., 10
100 nm) [50, 51, 52, 53]
involves dewetting of the inter-plate region. As shown
by B´erard et al. [54], such dewetting is not particular to
water, but arises as a general consequence of weak ﬂuid-
wall interactions relative to ﬂuid-ﬂuid interactions [24].
The generality of conﬁnement-induced drying notwith-
standing, interest in this phenomenon has focused pre-
dominantly on the case in which the conﬁned ﬂuid is
water and the conﬁning surfaces are hydrophobic. Sev-
eral computational studies of this situation exist (e.g.,
[36, 44, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61]).

−

Kauzmann’s inﬂuential review [62] ﬁrst pointed out the
importance of hydrophobic interactions in protein fold-
ing. It is generally accepted that the formation of a core
of hydrophobic residues from which water is partially
excluded is a dominant force in the folding of globular
proteins [62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71]. How-
ever, the surface of a protein is a geometrically, chemi-
cally, and electrically heterogeneous object, and the dis-
tribution, structure, and dynamics of water near such
a surface is expected to be quite diﬀerent from that
found near idealized surfaces, such as perfectly hydropho-
bic walls.
In fact, computer simulations have clearly
shown a range of water behavior in response to surface
heterogeneity. Cheng and Rossky [72] studied the hy-
dration of the polypeptide melittin. They found that
clathrate-like structures dominate near convex surface
patches, while near ﬂat regions the hydration shell ﬂuc-
tuates between clathrate-like and less ordered (inverted)
structures. The collapse of a two-domain BphC enzyme
showed no dewetting in the inter-domain region when
the units were brought together down to a distance of
0.4 nm [73]. A dewetting transition was observed only
when electrostatic interactions were turned oﬀ [73]. In
contrast, dewetting has been observed in the collapse of
of the melittin tetramer [74]; however, even single muta-
tions were shown to prevent drying.

The above protein folding examples illustrate the im-
portance of understanding water behavior near complex,
heterogeneous surfaces. Materials science and engineer-
ing applications involving chemically nanopatterned sub-
strates (e.g., [75]) likewise will require an understanding
of water structure near heterogeneous interfaces. Molec-
ular simulations should prove extremely powerful in ad-
dressing this problem, because they allow exquisitely sen-
sitive control of surface geometry and chemistry. Ques-
tions such as the manner in which the characteristic
length of hydrophobic patches and the pattern of their
distribution on a hydrophilic surface aﬀect conﬁned wa-

2

ter structure and dynamics, or the eﬀect of surface chem-
istry in promoting or preventing bulk cavitation follow-
ing dewetting of a conﬁned region are ideally suited for
computational scrutiny. The recent work of Koishi et
al.
[59] is an excellent example of the valuable insights
that can be obtained by molecular simulations regarding
water behavior near complex surfaces.

This paper is the ﬁrst report of an ongoing compu-
tational investigation aimed at understanding the inﬂu-
ence of surface heterogeneity and bulk thermodynamic
conditions (pressure, temperature) on the structure, dy-
namics, and thermodynamics of conﬁned water. Here we
establish the ‘base case’ conditions by comparing water
structure and phase behavior at 300 K when conﬁned
by purely hydrophobic and purely hydrophilic nanoscale
1.6 nm). Li et al. [58] have recently
surfaces (0.4
studied hydration and dewetting near hydrophilic and
hydrophobic plates (but with diﬀerent chemistry than
the ones we consider here), at a single pressure. An
important aspect of the present work is that we per-
form such a comparison over a broad range of pressures
(
0.2 GPa). In subsequent papers we will
−
report results on water conﬁned between heterogeneous
plates with engineered ‘patchiness’.

Our computational study should be placed in the con-
text of a considerable body of experimental work aimed
at studying systematically the properties of water con-
ﬁned by hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces. The
forces between hydrophobic surfaces in aqueous solution
have been measured with the surface force apparatus
(e.g., [50, 51, 52, 53, 76]). Such studies revealed the
existence of long-range attractions between hydrophobic
surfaces, over distances of the order of 100 nm, and in-
vestigated the origin of this phenomenon. Bridging cavi-
ties and microbubbles were linked in several [50, 52, 53],
but not all [51] of these studies, to the long-ranged at-
traction. Zhang et al. [77] investigated the response to
shear stresses of water conﬁned between adjoining sur-
faces, one hydrophobic and the other hydrophilic (Janus
surface). They found that the competing eﬀects of these
surfaces gave rise to unusually noisy responses to shear.
Jensen et al.
[55] used X-ray reﬂectivity to study the
contact region between water and an extended paraﬃn
surface. They found that drying was conﬁned to a very
1.5 nm) region. Ruan et al. [78] investigated
narrow (
the structure and dynamics of water near a hydrophilic
surface using ultrafast electron crystallography. They ob-
served coexistence between ordered surface water (up to
1 nm thick) and crystalline islands. Reference to particu-
lar aspects of the studies summarized above will be made
throughout this paper, stressing, whenever possible, the
relationship between experimental observations and our
calculations.

This paper is organized as follows. In the next section
we describe the simulation details. The results for hy-
drophobic plates are presented in Sec. III; calculations
on water conﬁned by hydrophilic plates are reported in
Sec. IV. We summarize our main conclusions in Sec. V.

II. SIMULATION DETAILS

We perform molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in
the NPT ensemble. The system is composed of N = 3375
water molecules in which are inmersed two identical ﬁnite
three dimensional nanoscale plates. The temperature is
ﬁxed at T = 300 K by using a Berendsen thermostat
[79]. The pressure ranges from P =
0.15 GPa to P =
0.2 GPa, and is controlled by coupling the system volume
to an external bath at P (analogous to the Berendsen
thermostat [79]).

−

We simulate a cubic sample using periodic boundary
conditions along the three directions. Water molecules
are modelled with the SPC/E pair potential [80]. The
plates are introduced symmetrically about the center of
y plane and
the box such that they are parallel to the x
equidistant from the z = 0 plane. The plate dimensions
0.866 nm3) are smaller than the box size
(3.215
(which varies with P but always exceeds 4.85 nm under
the conditions investigated here). Figures 1(a) and (b)
show a fully hydroxylated silica plate (one of the two
kinds of plates used in this study) and Fig. 1(c) is a
cross section, showing the water molecules and the two
cavities where the plates are located. The plates are ﬁxed
in space throughout.

We consider two kinds of plates: hydrophobic or hy-
drophilic. Their common underlying structure corre-
sponds to four layers of SiO2 [see Fig. 1(b)] reproducing
the (1.1.1) octahedral face of cristobalite [81, 82] [see Fig.
1(a)]. The unit cell of SiO2 is idealized as a perfect tetra-
hedron with O
O distances of 0.247 nm and
−
0.151 nm, respectively. The hydrophobic plates consist of
the above-described structure; however, the ‘Si’ and ‘O’
atoms interact with water molecule O atoms exclusively
via a Lennard-Jones potential (ǫ and σ parameters are
given in Table I). Each hydrophobic plate is composed
of 674 atoms.

O and Si

−

−

The hydrophilic plates correspond to fully hydroxy-
lated silica and are obtained by attaching a hydrogen
atom to each surface oxygen atom on the four plate sur-
faces [see Figs. 1(d) and (e)]. The O
H distance is
chosen to be the same as in the SPC/E model, i.e. 0.1
nm. The Si and O atoms are located in ﬁxed positions
(as in the hydrophobic plates) but the H atoms on the
surface are able to move with ﬁxed bond lengths and
bond angles; each H atom can reorient in a circle. Such
circular motion occurs in a plane parallel to the plate at
a distance 0.033 nm away from the O atom plane of the
Si
H angle is
109o.27 [see Fig. 1(e)]. Each hydrophilic plate is com-
posed of 778 atoms. Only the polar Si
H groups at
the surface carry partial electric charge [charge values are
given in Table I]. Electrostatic interactions are treated
using the Ewald sum method with a cutoﬀ distance of
0.79 nm and parameters mmax = 53 (for the number of
vectors in the reciprocal-space sum) and α = 0.4 (for
the width of the screening-charge Gaussian distribution)
[83, 84].

The vibrations of the Si and O atoms have not been
taken into account in this work. A computational study
of water in single-wall carbon nanotubes indicates that
ﬂexibility can aﬀect a channel’s apparent hydrophobicity
[29]. On the other hand, a molecular dynamics study
of water droplets on graphite revealed a negligible eﬀect
of substrate vibrations on the contact angle [85]. The
lattice constant for the cristobalite structure used in this
work is 0.494 nm. Invoking a Lindemann-type estimate,
the amplitude of individual atomic vibrations should be
considerably smaller than the melting threshold (10% of
the lattice constant), i.e. 0.05 nm in our case. This upper
bound on the magnitude of substrate atomic vibrations
is an order of magnitude smaller than the closest inter-
plate separation considered in our work. Thus, while the
eﬀect of crystal vibrations on the structure and dynamics
of conﬁned water deserves careful attention and will be
explored in future studies, we believe that the present
rigid wall base case is a reasonable starting point for our
investigations.

The pressure is calculated using the virial expression,
taking into account the fact that some atoms in the plates
are ﬁxed and others can move [84, 86]. We also use the
link cell and neighbor list methods to calculate the pair
interactions [87].

We perform simulations for diﬀerent time intervals de-
pending on the kind of plates and their separation. Simu-
lation times are indicated in Table II. One of the reasons
we chose these simulation times is that when there is
no capillary evaporation or crystallization, we ﬁnd that
quantities such us total energy and volume are constant
for t > 50 ps. Thus, the ﬁrst 50 ps of the simulation are
discarded and the rest of the simulation is used for data
acquisition. Moreover, the correlation time (obtained
from the intermediate scattering function) in bulk wa-
ter simulations using the SPC/E model at T = 300 K
and ρ = 1.0 g/cm3 is approximately 3 ps [88]. Thus, our
simulations appear long enough to avoid eﬀects of the
equilibration process on our calculations.

III. RESULTS: HYDROPHOBIC PLATES

A. Capillary evaporation: eﬀect of pressure

In this section, we describe the eﬀects of pressure P and
plate-plate separation d on the phase behavior of water
conﬁned between hydrophobic plates at T = 300 K. To
consistently deﬁne d, we use the distance between the
planes containing the hydrogen (H) atoms on the inner
surfaces of two hydrophilic plates.
In the case of hy-
drophobic plates, where no hydrogen atoms are present,
the same planes (where the H atoms would hypothet-
ically be located) are used to deﬁne d. As previously
noted, the plane containing the H atoms is located at a
distance 0.033 nm from the plane containing the oxygen
atoms of the silanol groups.

in a plane and are not able to diﬀuse due to the lack of
space between plates.

the plates expands to the bulk liquid, inducing cavita-
tion of the whole system.

served between the plates. Thus, practically speaking,

Observations

consistent with this picture have
been reported in measurements of the force between
hydrophobically-coated mica surfaces immersed in water

[53]. Speciﬁcally, vapor cavities formed spontaneously
when mica surfaces coated with a double-chain cationic
ﬂuorocarbon surfactant approached to distances between
1 and 4 nm [53]. However, cavities only formed after sep-
aration from contact when the mica surfaces were coated
with a double-chain cationic hydrocarbon surfactant [53].
Both the separation at which cavities formed and the
magnitude of the force between the hydrophobic surfaces
were found to be very sensitive to the speciﬁc substance
used to coat the mica surface [52, 53]. The measured
width of the dewetting layer formed at an extended paraf-
1.5 nm) is also consistent with the
ﬁn surface in water (
present calculations [55].

Our results on capillary evaporation are in agreement
with previous grand canonical ensemble Monte Carlo
simulations of water using the SPC model [89]. That
work shows that capillary evaporation between smooth
planar hydrophobic walls occurs at walls separations

The presence of a crystal at high P has not been dis-
cussed so far in the context of capillary evaporation.
However, there is considerable evidence from MD sim-
ulations showing that conﬁned water may crystallize at
high P (see e.g. [90]). Koga et al. found crystallization in
MD simulations of the TIP4P model at T
300 K
1.0 GPa [91, 92, 93]. The ice structure
and P = 0.5
that we ﬁnd is similar to that found in [91, 93] and re-
sembles none of the structures of the existing ice phases
in bulk water, nor those found in metallic or hydropho-
bic pores [94, 95, 96, 97]. Figure 4(a), a top view of the
bilayer ice, clearly shows a hexagonal lattice, while Fig.
4(b) suggests that each layer is almost ﬂat, and that the
two layers are in registry.

To conﬁrm that conﬁned water crystallizes at high P
and d
0.6 nm, we calculate the mean square displace-
ment (MSD) parallel to the plates at P = 0.2 GPa for
diﬀerent values of d. Figure 5(a) shows the MSD for a
400 ps simulation averaging over molecules (we do not
average over starting times). For d = 0.4 nm, we ﬁnd
that MSD
0 consistent with the earlier observation
that molecules are trapped between the plate atoms. For
d = 0.5, 0.8, and 1.0 nm the MSD increases monoton-
ically with time and, for a ﬁxed time, with d. How-
ever, the MSD for d = 0.6 nm shows a fast increase for
t . 50 ps and then approaches an asymptotic value of
0.2 nm. Snapshots of the system during the ﬁrst 50 ps
≈
show that the molecules in the conﬁned space reorganize
to form the crystal. For 50 ps . t . 300ps, the resulting
ice shows defects that disappear with time. The trans-
formation is almost over for t
300 ps. In the absence of
crystallization, one would expect the MSD at long times
for d = 0.6 nm to fall between that corresponding to
d = 0.5 nm and d = 0.8 nm. Instead, the MSD curve
for d = 0.6 nm shows a plateau, as for d = 0.4 nm, after
about 250 ps, consistent with the view that the system

≈

crystallizes.

The crystallization of conﬁned water is also conﬁrmed
by structural properties such as the radial distribution
function (RDF) parallel to the plates, gxy(r), and the
probability density function to ﬁnd a molecule located at
z between the plates, Pn(z). Figure 5(b) shows gxy(r) for
the ice (d = 0.6 nm) and for a bilayer liquid (d = 0.8 nm).
The oscillations in gxy(r) for d = 0.6 nm are a clear sign
of crystallization. Such oscillations are not present in the
liquid phase. We note that the slow decay of gxy(r) for
large r is due to the ﬁnite size of the plates. This ﬁnite
size eﬀect can be removed by taking the ratio of gxy(r)
for the crystal to that of the liquid (see inset). The per-
sistence of oscillations is then clear. Figure 5(c) shows
the Pn(z) for the ice (d = 0.6 nm) and for a comparable
liquid (d = 0.8 nm). While in both cases water molecules
form two layers [98], the peaks of Pn(z) are much larger
at d = 0.6 nm than at d = 0.8 nm. Pn(z) was calcu-
lated from a histogram of water molecules in 78 slices
into which the distance between plates was divided. It is
deﬁned so that

Pn(z) dz = 1.

We note that no spontaneous crystallization in bulk or
conﬁned water has been reported in MD simulations us-
ing the SPC/E model. Crystallization using the TIP4P
[99] and TIP5P models has been obtained [100]. In our
case, we note that the location of water molecules belong-
ing to each of the two ice layers is highly correlated with
the plate structure, suggesting that the crystal we ob-
tain is templated by the plate. Such substrate-templated
crystallization of interfacial water has been observed on
hydrophilic surfaces [78]. Figure 6(a) is a schematic di-
agram showing both the hexagons formed by the water
oxygen atoms and the atoms at the plate surface. The
atoms at the plate surface are arranged in tetrahedra
pointing either into or out of the page of the ﬁgure. These
two kinds of tetrahedra alternate, forming rings com-
posed of six tetrahedra [see also Fig. 1(a)]. Two rules de-
termine the structure of a given hexagon of the ice layers:
(i) a water oxygen atom is located on top of each tetrahe-
dron pointing into the page of the ﬁgure; and (ii) a water
oxygen atom is located on top of the center of the hexag-
onal rings formed by the tetrahedra at the plate surface.
As a result, the ice layers are formed by perfect hexagons
with an OO distance of 0.29 nm. Interestingly, this is the
same distance separating the two ice layers [see Fig. 5(c)].
Thus, the OO distance between nearest and next near-
est neighbors are 0.29 nm and √3
0.29 nm = 0.49 nm,
respectively. These values are in agreement with the lo-
cation of the ﬁrst two maxima of gxy(r) [see Fig. 5(b)]
which are located at
0.51 nm, respec-
tively.

The bilayer ice is fully hydrogen-bonded and each
molecule has four HBs, as in ordinary ice. HBs occur ei-
ther between molecules in the same ice layer or between
both layers (i.e., there are no HB pointing toward the
plates). The two water layers are linked by HBs where a
molecule of one layer shares one of its H atoms with the
nearest oxygen atom of the other layer [see Figure 6(b)

5

and (c)]. We note that the HOH angle in the SPC/E
model is 109.47o, i.e., the tetrahedral angle. However,
in the bilayer ice structure, the OOO angles (formed be-
tween three nearest neighbors) are either 90o or 120o.
Therefore, in general, the OO directions (between near-
est neighbors) diﬀer slightly from the OH directions of a
given water molecule.

In refs.

[101, 102], it was found that TIP4P water
within carbon nanotubes can crystallize forming a tube
of square, pentagonal, or hexagonal ice, depending on the
nanotube radius. The structure of the carbon nanotube

Simulations of water between crystalline inﬁnite walls
[90, 103, 104], and between
using the TIP5P model
smooth inﬁnite walls using the TIP5P [105] and TIP4P
models [92] also show the formation of crystals at T =
300 K. Both monolayer and tri-layer ices have been re-
ported [104, 105]. As indicated in Fig. 2, our simula-
tions at P = 0.2 GPa show no sign of monolayer ice at
small d nor of crystallization to other solids at larger d
(corresponding to n-layer crystals, n
3). Small vari-
ations in d (. 0.1 nm) were found to have a profound
eﬀect on the appearance and disappearance of conﬁned
ices [92, 103, 104]. In Fig. 2, the values of d simulated
at a given P are separated by ∆d
0.1 nm. Thus, it is
possible (but unlikely) that these ices can be found for
300 K when using a smaller ∆d.
conﬁned SPC/E at T
Figure 2 also shows a schematic conﬁned phase dia-
gram superimposed on the simulation data points. The
bilayer crystal and liquid phases are indicated, together
with an estimate of the dewetting transition line. At
T = 300 K, we ﬁnd that the dewetting transition line ex-
tends down to d = 0.5 nm, suggesting that it merges with
the region (deﬁned by d . 0.4 nm) for which molecules
gets trapped between the plate atoms. It is interesting
to consider whether for a higher T the dewetting tran-
sition line might end in a critical point. The relation-
ship between the dewetting locus and water’s ordinary
vapor-liquid critical point will be investigated in future
studies at higher temperatures. It is also possible that
the bilayer crystal region in Fig. 2 expands down to the
dewetting transition line (see red dotted line in the ﬁg-
ure). In this case, there would be a triple point where the
vapor phase coexists with the liquid and crystal phases.
Our simulation at P = 0.05 GPa and d = 0.6 nm does
not show the presence of a crystalline structure. Instead,
we observe a competition between a disordered (liquid)
structure and bubble formation. At 600 ps a bubble oc-
cupies 25% of the conﬁned space, and at 1 ns we ﬁnd
that 90% of the conﬁned space is dewetted. With the
size of the plate area that we simulate, it is not possible
to observe simultaneously the vapor, liquid, and crystal

phases [only approximately ﬁve hexagons per side can be
clearly observed in Fig. 4(a)] . A precise investigation of
the existence (or lack thereof) of a triple point requires
larger plate surface areas than we have used in this work.

B. Water structure: eﬀect of pressure

To study the eﬀects of pressure on the structure of
water we ﬁx d = 1.6 nm. This separation is large enough
so that water properties in the middle region between the
plates are essentially those of bulk water [46].

Figure 7 shows the average water density between the
plates at each pressure, ρ(P ). For comparison, we show
also the density of bulk water reported in [88]. We de-

mass of a water molecule and
is the average num-
ber of molecules in the conﬁned space between the walls.
When dealing with conﬁned systems, deﬁning the ac-
cessible volume for the conﬁned liquid is not unique.
We estimate Vconf in two ways: by the formal dimen-
sions of the conﬁned space, based on the deﬁned d, i.e.,
3.215 nm3; and by an eﬀective
Vconf = 1.6

def f /2) = 0.5 [see Fig. 8(a)].
R
The ﬁrst approach to the calculation of Vconf underesti-
mates ρ(P ) because the formal conﬁned volume extends
practically to the plate surface (i.e., the plane where the
H atoms would be located), and thus includes space not
accessible in practice to water molecules. The second (ef-
fective) deﬁnition of Vconf overestimates ρ(P ) because it
leaves out from the calculation a portion of volume that
is in fact accessible to water molecules.

ρ(P ) in the conﬁned space is always smaller than the
bulk density for P . 0.06 GPa, independently of the
method used to calculate Vconf . For P > 0.06 GPa the
two estimates of Vconf produce drastically diﬀerent re-
sults. One expects that at high P the water density in
the conﬁned space approaches that of the bulk water.
It can be seen from Fig. 7 that the formal deﬁnition of
Vconf , using the d-value deﬁned a priori, leads to a more
reasonable high-P trend. For all cases, one ﬁnds that
the slope of ρ(P ) is always greater than that of bulk wa-
ter indicating greater compressibility between the plates.
To conﬁrm this, we interpolate ρ(P ) in Fig. 7 with a sec-
ond order polynomial, and calculate the corresponding
derivative with respect to P. The resulting values for the
compressibility, κT , at P = 0 GPa and T = 300 K are:
κT 0.47 GPa−1, for bulk water; and κT 1.47 GPa−1 (for-
mal volume) and κT 1.70 GPa−1 (eﬀective volume), for
conﬁned water. The experimental value of the compress-
ibility at these conditions is κT 0.45 GPa−1 [106], in good
agreement with the simulations.

Figure 8(a) shows the density proﬁle ρslab(z), i.e. the
local density in a slab parallel to the plates, located at z.

It was calculated using 39 slabs of width 0.0411 nm, with
an area equal to the plates area. ρslab(z) resembles the
number density at normal T and P reported in Ref. [46].
Figure 8(a) indicates that the main eﬀect of increasing
P is to push water molecules toward the plates. Accord-
ingly, as P increases, ρslab(z) increases for z
0 and

‘harder’ plates at high P . We obtain the same conclu-
sions when looking at the probability density function for

To analyze the local packing and hydrogen bonding, we
calculate the average coordination number CN (z) and
the order parameter q(z) used to characterize the local
tetrahedral order in water [107, 108]. Averages are taken
over slabs of width 0.0411 nm centered at diﬀerent z. We
deﬁne CN (z) as the number of neighbor oxygens within

ﬁrst minimum of the radial distribution function depends
slightly on P ). We observe that CN (Z) decreases as
one approaches the plates. However, right next to the
plates we ﬁnd sharp maxima. Moreover, such maxima
increase with P as water molecules are pushed toward
the plates [see Fig. 8(a)]. When the O atoms in the
plates are not considered in the calculation of CN (z),
we ﬁnd a distribution similar to that of [46]. In this case,

To study the orientational structure, we follow [46] and
compute the distribution of angles θhb between the four

HB vectors of water molecules and the inward pointing
normal to the plates. Each molecule is associated with
four HB vectors: these four vectors point tetrahedrally
outwards from the oxygen Lennard-Jones site, and such
that two of them join the O site to the same molecule’s H
atoms. The normalized distribution P (θhb) in the prox-
imity of the plates is shown in Fig. 9 for diﬀerent values
of P . P (θhb) shows maxima at θhb = 70o and 180o indi-
cating a preferred orientation for a water molecule with
one HB vector pointing toward the nearest plate. These
results, and a P (θhb) calculated in slabs at diﬀerent dis-
tances from the plates (not shown), are in agreement with
the results obtained in ref. [46] in constant volume MD
simulations. Interestingly, we ﬁnd that when P increases,
despite changes in ρslab(z), P (θhb) barely changes, as is
In particular, molecules next to the

plates preserve their distinct orientational order under
pressure. This is in agreement with the noted invariance
of q(z)

0.5 next to the surfaces for all P .

The radial distribution function (RDF) for the water
molecule O atom and the O atom at the surface of the
plate, gO′O(r), is shown in Fig. 10. At all P , gO′O(r) has
maxima at 0.32, 0.60, and 0.77 nm. For comparison, the
ﬁrst maximum of the bulk water RDF at ρ = 0.984 g/cm3
and T = 284.5 K [109] is at 0.28 nm. Thus, water oxy-
gen atoms are located farther from plate surface oxygen
atoms than from other water molecule oxygen atoms, as
expected for hydrophobic surface atoms. The increase of
P does not shift the location of the maxima and minima
of gO′O(r), but changes their relative heights. As P in-
creases, more molecules are found in the conﬁned space
and, at the same time, more molecules shift from inter-
stitial to coordination shells. Thus, the conﬁned liquid
becomes more structured upon compression.

≈

In summary, the eﬀect of pressure on the structure of
water conﬁned between hydrophobic plates is to enhance
water structure, pushing the water molecules toward the
plates. The orientation of water molecules next to the
plates is not sensitive to compression, as indicated by
Fig. 9.

IV. RESULTS: HYDROPHILIC PLATES

Over the range of conditions investigated here (T =
0.05, 0.05, and 0.2 GPa, and in each case
300 K, P =
d = 0.6, 1.0, and 1.6 nm), we ﬁnd that the conﬁned
water remains in the liquid state, and shows no sign
of capillary evaporation or crystallization. In agreement
with the hydrophobic plate simulations, we ﬁnd that for
P
0.1 GPa, the whole system cavitates; i.e., liquid
water is unstable. Experimentally, this would manifest
itself as loss of cohesion and the appearance of a macro-
scopic vapor phase; computationally, it becomes impos-
sible to maintain tensions in excess of 0.1 GPa and the
system volume grows uncontrollably due to the appear-
ance of the vapor phase. However, even in this case we
ﬁnd no capillary evaporation between hydrophilic plates.

In other words, liquid water ﬁlls the conﬁned space, and
the hydrophilic plates induce wetting even when there is
bulk cavitation around the plates.

As previously done for the case of the hydrophobic
plates, we chose a distance between plates of d = 1.6 nm.
The average density in the conﬁned space between hy-
drophilic plates is shown in Fig. 11. As for the hydropho-
n(t)
bic plates case, we deﬁne ρ(P ) =

and use both d = 1.6 nm and Pn(

pute Vconf .
In contrast to the hydrophobic case, both
methods now lead to very similar ρ(P ) values. The un-
derestimated (formal volume) and overestimated (eﬀec-
tive volume) values of ρ(P ) are very close to each other
and bracket those for bulk water. Interestingly, Fig. 11
shows that the slopes of ρ(P ) for conﬁned water (using
both volume deﬁnitions) are almost the same as that of
bulk water. This suggests that the compressibility of wa-
ter conﬁned by hydrophilic plates is the same as that of
bulk water. In fact, we calculate the compressibility as
in Sec. III B, for the case of water conﬁned by hydropho-
bic plates. We ﬁnd that, using either the formal volume
or the eﬀective volume, the compressibility of water con-
0.52 GPa−1, close to
ﬁned by hydrophilic plates is κT ≈
0.47 GPa−1 of bulk water.
the value κT ≈
Figure 12 shows ρslab(z), CN (z), and q(z) for water
conﬁned between hydrophilic plates at diﬀerent values of
P . The three quantities are insensitive to P over the
range of conditions investigated here. Thus, the strong
attraction exerted by the walls on liquid water is not
measurably perturbed by the additional forces associated
with compression. The two maxima of ρslab(z) in Fig.
12(a) clearly indicate the presence of two water layers
next to the plates. We note that Fig. 12(a) is very sim-
ilar to Fig. 3 of Ref.
[110] for the TIP4P water model.
From Fig. 12(b) and (c), we ﬁnd that both CN (z) and
q(z) in the presence of hydrophilic plates decrease to zero
very sharply at the plate surfaces. Moreover, a compar-
ison of Fig. 8(c) and 12(c) shows that in the absence
of the hydroxylated groups on the plates, the values of
q(z) start to decrease at larger distances from the walls
than in the case of hydrophilic plates. The resulting pro-
ﬁles in Fig. 12(b) and (c) are almost ﬂat for the region
between the plates meaning that the values of CN (z)
and q(z) next to the plates barely change with respect
to their bulk water values at z = 0. These results sug-
gest that water molecules far from the plates have simi-
lar local environment (in terms of tetrahedral order and
number of nearest-neighbors) as those next to the plates
(when including the plate surface oxygen atoms). For
the molecules next to the plates, the O
H atoms on the
plate surface act as ‘virtual’ water molecules providing
extra HBs to the real water molecules. Again, the slight
change in CN (z) at z
0 is probably due to the fact that
we use a ﬁxed cutoﬀ when calculating the coordination

Figure 13 shows P (θhb) corresponding to a slab next to
the plates of width 0.1 nm. P (θhb) is in agreement with
the corresponding distribution computed in ref.
[110]
for the TIP4P water model and is complementary to the
distribution found in the case of hydrophobic plates (see
Fig. 9). The presence of polarity on the plate allows wa-
ter molecules to form HBs with atoms on the plate. The
resulting P (θhb) increases abruptly for θhb < 20o and has
110o. As already found in [110] for
a sharp peak at θhb ≈
the TIP4P water model, these maxima can be explained
by the presence of multiple HBs that a water molecule
can have with OH groups associated with the plate (see
Fig. 14 in [110]). Ultrafast electron crystallography mea-
surements of water conﬁned between hydrophilic walls
[78] also show that water molecules interact at two sites
of the substrate.

The RDFs between the plate oxygen (O′) or hydro-
gen (H ′) atoms and the water molecule oxygen atoms
are shown in Fig. 14. These distributions do not change
with P , conﬁrming the insensitivity of conﬁned water
structure between hydrophilic plates to changes in exter-
nal pressure. Figure 14 is in agreement with Figs. 11
and 12 of Ref. [110], which were obtained for the TIP4P
water model.

We have presented results from MD simulations of

In the case of hydrophobic plates, a phase diagram
in the P
d plane summarizing the MD results is pre-
sented, and three phases (liquid, vapor, and bilayer ice)
are identiﬁed. At low P we ﬁnd capillary evaporation.
The distance at which this drying occurs decreases with
increasing P . Furthermore, the transition line in the
P
d phase diagram separating the vapor and liquid
phases is followed to small values of d, below which water
molecules become individually trapped and immobilized
by the surface atoms. It is possible that at higher T , this
line ends in a critical point at high d (corresponding to
the liquid-vapor critical point of bulk water).

The bilayer ice is composed of two layers of hexagons
in registry along the surface normal. The resulting ice
is similar to that found in Ref. [91]. This ice is found
at P
0.6 nm, but only in a narrow
d
range of d. The region corresponding to ice in the P
phase diagram might be connected with the vapor-liquid
transition line for larger plates, corresponding to a triple
point. However, the plates we simulate are small, and
we cannot observe simultaneously the liquid, vapor and
crystal phases. Further investigation is required on this

point. We also note that at T = 300 K and in the pres-
ence of nanoscale plates, we do not ﬁnd indications of a
monolayer ice, like that observed in MD simulations us-
ing the TIP4P and TIP5P potentials and inﬁnite walls
[103].

When simulating water conﬁned by hydrophilic (hy-
droxylated silica) plates, we ﬁnd that the conﬁned wa-
ter remains in the liquid phase at all P and d studied.
Moreover, even at P where we observe cavitation in the
bulk water, the conﬁned water is in the liquid phase. In
other words, the hydrophilic plates induce wetting in the
conﬁned space (a phenomenon reminiscent of capillary
condensation). This result suggests that one way to sta-
bilize liquid water under tension may be by hydrophilic
conﬁnement. Experiments of water conﬁned between a
hydrophobic and a hydrophilic surface (Janus interface)
[77], suggest a similar physical picture, where the hy-
drophobic surface encourages water to dewet, while the
hydrophilic surface constrains water to be present.

We also study the eﬀect of P on the hydration of both
hydrophobic and hydrophilic plates. We focus on the wa-
ter molecule distribution, average coordination number
and local tetrahedral order parameter along the direction
normal to the plates. In the case of hydrophobic plates,
all of these quantities indicate that as P increases, water
molecules are pushed toward the plates while the liquid
becomes more structured. However, the water molecule
orientation next to the plates shows no dependence on
P . As previously reported in ref. [46], molecules have on
average one HB pointing to the plate. Strikingly, for the
case of hydrophilic plates, we ﬁnd no change in the liquid
structure with P in the range

0.1 GPa to 0.2 GPa.

The strong diﬀerences observed in the behavior of wa-
ter conﬁned between hydrophilic and hydrophobic plates
leads to the interesting question of what the thermody-
namic and structural properties of water are when it is
conﬁned between heterogeneous plates (e.g., hydrophobic
plates that have been partially hydroxylated). Results
addressing this question will be reported in a subsequent
report.

where NLJ is the number of particles. We can esti-
mate ∆P in our simulations by using this equation with
NLJ = 3375 + 1348 = 4723 (i.e., the number of oxy-
gen atoms of the water molecules plus the number of
atoms in the plates that have LJ interactions) and the
values of ǫ and σ from the SPC/E model. This gives,
∆P [GP a] ≈ −821/V 2 ([V ] = nm3). Thus, depending
on the volume of our simulations we get −0.063 GPa
< ∆P < −0.047 GPa.

[98] The presence of the small third peak in Fig. 5c is due to
crystal defects occurring during the ice formation (ap-
proximately t < 300 ps), which causes some diﬀusing
molecules between the two ice layers during the tran-
sient crystallization to be included in the statistics. Fur-
thermore, there are ”border eﬀects” due to the ﬁnite size
of the plates. Thus, molecules at the boundaries of the
plates (which do not belong to the crystal) might have
been included in the statistics.

FIG. 2: (Color online) Phase behavior of conﬁned water as
a function of pressure and separation between nanoscale hy-
drophobic plates. The temperature is ﬁxed at T = 300 K.
Filled circles indicate liquid state points. Empty squares in-
dicate vapor state points at which capillary evaporation oc-
curs (i.e., we observe no water molecule between plates). For
d ≈ 0.6 nm, a bilayer crystal is formed as indicated by red
× symbols. At d = 0.6 nm and P = 0.05 GPa, ﬂuctuations
between liquid and vapor states are observed for at least 1 ns.
Continuous lines suggest a schematic phase diagram based
on the simulation results. In the ﬁgure, the dashed red line
corresponds to the assumption that the crystal region is not
connected with the liquid-vapor transition line, i.e. that there
is no ‘triple point’ between the liquid, the vapor, and the bi-
layer crystal. The black dotted line is the extrapolation of the
liquid-vapor transition line into the d ≤ 0.4 nm region, where
no liquid can be simulated due to the small distance between
plates.

FIG. 6: (Color online) (a) Schematic diagram showing the

to the position of the hydrophobic plate surface atoms. Red
ﬁlled circles represent ‘oxygen’ atoms belonging to a single
plane on the plate surface. The next layers of ‘oxygen’ atoms,
above and below this plane, are represented by empty and
ﬁlled black diamonds, respectively. The atoms at the plate
surface are arranged in tetrahedra pointing either into or out
of the page of the ﬁgure [cf. Fig. 1 (d),(e)]. Tetrahedra point-
ing into the page correspond to the cross-hatched triangles
centered on the ﬁlled diamonds, while those pointing out of
the page correspond to triangles centered on the empty dia-
monds. Water oxygen atoms are represented by empty circles;
a typical hexagon is indicated by blue lines. Lateral (b) and
top (b) view of molecules belonging to the bilayer ice, showing
the hydrogen bonds. We show only two water molecules with
the corresponding hydrogen atoms (red and white spheres).
These molecules belong to diﬀerent layers of the ice and their
corresponding nearest neighbors are represented by blue and
green spheres. Yellow lines are a guide to the eye showing the
lattice characterizing the bilayer ice.

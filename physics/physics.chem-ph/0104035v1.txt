Abstract

The Boeder diﬀerential equation is solved in this work over a wide range of α, yielding the prob-

ability density functions (PDF), that describe the average orientations of rod-like macromolecules

in a ﬂowing liquid. The quantity α is the ratio of the hydrodynamic shear rate to the rotational

diﬀusion coeﬃcient.

It characterises the coupling of the motion of the macromolecules in the

hydrodynamic ﬂow to their thermal diﬀusion. Previous analytical work is limited to approximate

solutions for small values of α. Special analytical as well as numerical methods are developed in

the present work in order to calculate accurately the PDF for a range of α covering several orders
of magnitude, 10−6 ≤ α ≤ 108. The mathematical nature of the diﬀerential equation is revealed

as a singular perturbation problem when α becomes large. Scaling results are obtained over the

diﬀerential equation for α ≥ 103. Monte Carlo Brownian simulations are also constructed and

shown to agree with the numerical solutions of the diﬀerential equation in the bulk of the ﬂowing

liquid, for an extensive range of α. This conﬁrms the robustness of the developed analytical and

numerical methods.

INTRODUCTION

The most widely used experimental technique for the observation of rotational diﬀusion

of macromolecules in hydrodynamic ﬂow is that corresponding to birefringence [1,2]. The

authors in [2], for example, have observed the existence of a depletion layer in dilute xanthan

solutions subjected to simple shear ﬂow, using the technique of evanescent induced ﬂuores-

cence. The motion and average orientations of macromolecules at dilute concentrations in

a ﬂowing liquid are determined by two conﬂicting forces, the ﬁrst is a hydrodynamic force

stemming from shear ﬂow, and the other thermal, originating from Brownian rotational dif-

fusion.

Boeder [3] is the ﬁrst to have studied this problem in the bulk of a ﬂowing liquid from the

theoretical point of view. He suggested, without the use of the Langevin formalism or the

Fokker-Planck equation [4,5], an ordinary diﬀerential equation, which governs a probability

distribution function P (θ) describing the average orientations of the macromolecules:

P ” + (αsin2(θ)P )′ = 0

(1)

This diﬀerential equation is derived for the motion of macromolecular rod-like particles,

of negligible cross-sectional area, in the plane of the ﬂow, without any boundary conditions.

The angle h describes the orientations of the macromolecules with respect to a reference

direction. The quantity α is the ratio

˙γ
DBr
where ˙γ is the shear rate in the hydrodynamic ﬂow, and DBr is a diﬀusion coeﬃcient

α =

(2)

governing the Brownian rotational motion of the rod. The diﬀering nature of the macro-

molecules and macromolecular polymers in their solutions leads to diﬀering values of DBr,

whereas the hydrodynamic ﬂow of the solution is characterised by given values of ˙γ. As has

been pointed out [3], a solution in closed form for this ordinary diﬀerential equation cannot

be obtained. Boeder gave a series solution valid only for small values of α. Although some

improvements have been made, on one hand to remove restrictions on the cross-sectional

areas of the macromolecules, and on the other to be able to consider rotational diﬀusion in

three dimensions [6,7], the available solutions are still limited to small values of α. To the

best of the authors’ knowledge there does not exist in the literature a general approach to

2

solve the Boeder diﬀerential equation for arbitrarily large values of α, or for a wide range

of its values. It is the purpose of this work to provide such an approach, using diﬀerent

analytical and numerical methods. Another interest is to compare the analytical approach

with Brownian simulations of the PDF, under the same conditions in the bulk of a ﬂowing

liquid. This comparison is useful because it can conﬁrm the robustness of the analytical

methods. It also provides a necessary limiting bulk condition for similar simulations near

solid surfaces where one is often led to making reasonable but unveriﬁable assumptions con-

cerning the touching collision of the macromolecule with the solid surface, [4,5,8]. Although

simulations have been developed in the past, as for polymers in plane bulk Poiseuille ﬂow [8],

and for the dispersion of rod-like particles in a bulk shear ﬂow [9], there is an absence of a

detailed comparison between the simulations and the analytical results in the bulk, precisely

because exact solutions of this diﬀerential equation have not been available. In Section 2,

we present an accurate analysis of the Boeder diﬀerential equation to obtain the probability

distribution function (PDF), for a wide range of α. In Section 3, four numerical methods are

proposed for the general solution of the diﬀerential equation in diﬀerent intervals of α, and

numerical results are presented to illustrate this. Scaling results are also presented in this

section for large values of α. In Section 4, Monte Carlo Brownian simulations are presented

for the PDF, and compared with the results of Section 3. The conclusions are given in

Section 5. 2.

II. ACCURATE ANALYSIS OF THE BOEDER EQUATION

In this section, a procedure for the accurate numerical analysis of the Boeder ordinary

diﬀerential equation and its associated probability distribution function, P (θ), is given for a
wide range of α. Turbulence eﬀects are known to take place for values of α ≥ 104 . Although

the Boeder diﬀerential equation ceases to apply in a strict physical sense beyond this limit,

the present mathematical analysis is not limited by this, and numerical solutions may be
calculated in our approach for values of α ≥ 106. P (θ) is the solution of a second-order

ordinary diﬀerential equation, Eq. (1). Since the Boeder PDF is periodic with a period

equal to π, as the macromolecular rods are indistinguishable when oriented at θ or θ + π,

the periodic boundary conditions

3

(3)

(4)

(5)

(6)

(7)

P (0) = P (π) and P ′(0) = P ′(π)

apply. In addition, the PDF has to be normalised over the interval:

The determination of the Boeder PDF is consequently a constrained boundary value

problem. Eq. (1), however, is not the only possible form for the Boeder equation, actually

two other versions of the equation exist. The ﬁrst takes the form of:

π

0
Z

P (θ)dθ = 1

P ′ + αsin2(θ)P = C

provided the initial value P (0) and the constant C are known. The second may be

presented as:

du/dθ = v,

dv/dθ = −αsin(θ)[sin(θ)v + 2cos(θ)u]

where u(θ) = P (θ), v(θ) = P ′(θ).

Several technical procedures may be used to determine P (θ) , depending on the diﬀerent

possible formulations of the problem, as an initial value problem or as a boundary value
problem. In all cases two quantities, the constant C in Eq. (5), equal to P ′(0) or v(0) , and

the initial value P (0) or u(0), have to be evaluated from α for any of its given values. We

have developed two methods, described below, to determine C and P (0). Firstly, a direct

method based on the solution of Eq. (5), and secondly a minimisation method based on a

multidimensional secant or Broyden method. The direct method to evaluate C and P (0) is

as follows. The formal solution of Eq. (5) may be given generally as

P (θ) = Cexp[α[sin(2θ)/2 − θ]/2]

exp[−α(sin(2x)/2 − x)/2]dx

(8)

Z
The lower limit −∞ is surprising since the problem is deﬁned over the angular interval

θ

−∞

[0, π] It is probably true to say, however, that the assumption to limit the space of stochastic

events to this interval has retarded the analytical approach until now. We can analytically

show that the lower limit −∞ is the only possibility compatible with the boundary conditions

4

given by Eq. (3). Physically this implies that the stochastic space is cumulative over an

inﬁnite number of events and hence angles. Performing a change of variables, the solution

may then be written as

∞

0
Z

P (θ) = (2C/α) exp[α sin(2θ)/4]

exp(−x) exp[ α sin(4x/α − 2θ)/4]dx

(9)

The form in Eq. (9) is more stable numerically than the previous one of Eq. (8), since

the numerically troublesome exp(θ) and exp(−θ) terms are avoided. Nevertheless when α

increases the exp[α sin(θ)/4] term will cause problems despite the bounded values of the

sine function, forcing us to turn to other methods based on extrapolation techniques. The

constant C is next determined from the normalisation condition of the Boeder PDF, as in

Eq. (4), yielding

C = α/

The PDF depends on a which we want to vary over several orders of magnitude. The

diﬃculty in solving the diﬀerential equation stems from the fact that its nature may be
modiﬁed when α increases, turning the problem into a singular perturbation one in α−1.

III. NUMERICAL SOLUTIONS AND SCALING OF THE BOEDER EQUATION

In order to cope with the wide range over which a may vary, we classify the various

methods for solving the problem according to the value of α. Essentially, there are at least

four methods to evaluate the PDF.

Method a. For α in the range : [10−3, 102] . Direct calculation from the analytic solution

of the ﬁrst-order diﬀerential equation.

Method b. For α in the range :

[10−3, 102].

If C and P (0) are known, a simple 1D

Runge-Kutta method is used to solve the ﬁrst-order diﬀerential equation.

5

Method c. For α in the range :

[10−6, 102] . Find C and P (0) by a minimisation

method based on a multidimensional secant or Broyden method, and do a 2D Runge-Kutta

method to solve the system of two ﬁrst-order diﬀerential equations, Eqs. (6) and (7). The

condition min|P (0) − P (π)| comes from periodicity, and that of min|

π
0 P (θ) − 1| is from

the normalisation of the PDF.

R

Method d. For For α in the range : [102, 108] and above. Calculate C and P (0) by an

extrapolation method and solve Eq. (5), or Eqs. (6) and (7), with singular perturbation

integration methods. To illustrate the diﬀerent numerical methods used in our approach to

solve the Boeder diﬀerential equation, and to calculate the PDF, some numerical results are

presented, for a wide range of values of α. In Figs. 1-4, the continuous curves depict these

PDF functions, for relatively high values of α =100, 1000, 2000, and 5000, respectively. The

PDF results are normalised with respect to unity. The PDF for other values of α have been

numerically calculated in a wide range, though they are not given here. The scaling results

are presented next for large values of α. Eq. (10) can be bounded by replacing the cosine

term in the exponential integrand by 1, and reducing the double integration appearing in

the C denominator into a simpler one, namely:

∞

0
Z

DC = π

exp(−x)exp[±(α/2)sin(2x/α)]dx

(12)

The sine term in Eq. (12) may be expanded for large values of α to yield DC ∼ α2/3
for the upper bound case (+ sign case), and DC ∼ α0 for the lower bound case ( - sign
case). Since C = α/2DC ; we obtain the limits on the behaviour of C, namely C ∼ α1/3 for
the upper bound. case (+ sign case), and C ∼ α1 for the lower bound case ( - sign case).
Consider that C ∼ α2/3 is an intermediate case in the space of stochastic events, when α is

large. It is then possible to show that:

The proof is as follows. Expanding the argument of the exponential integrand in Eq.

(13)

P (0) ∼ α1/3
θmax ∼ α−1/3
P (θmax) ∼ α1/3

6

(11), yields

P (0) = (2C/α)

exp(−8x3/3α2)dx

(14)

∞

0
Z

The integral in Eq. (14) behaves as ∼ α2/3, hence the result expressed in ﬁrst part of Eq.

(13). In order to prove the result of second part of Eq. (13), consider Eq. (5) at θ = θmax,

which may be written in this case as

(15)

(16)

(17)

For large values of α, the abscissa θmax of the maximum of the Boeder PDF is relatively

small, and Eq. (15) may be approximated to yield

α sin2(θmax)P (θmax) = C

α θ2

maxP (θmax) = C

Since θmax is small, we can expand P (θmax) around θ = 0; such that

P (θmax) ∼= P (0) + θ2

maxP ”(θmax)/2 + ...

P (θmax) ∼= P (0) is hence accurate to second-order in θmax. This may be seen graphically,

for example, in Figs. 2 and 3 for values of α= 1000 and 2000, and also for higher values. The

result expressed in last part of Eq. (13) follows accordingly. Another direct consequence

follows from Eq. (17) since it is now possible to write that

θmaxP (0) ∼ θmaxP (θmax) ∼ constant

(18)

which has a simple geometric interpretation. From the normalisation of the Boeder PDF

in Eq. (4) and when α is large, the area under the curve of the PDF is roughly the product

θmaxP (θmax) , the distribution function being sharply peaked around θmax , leading to a

PDF approximately triangular in shape with a height P (θmax) and a base of 2θmax. See,

Figs. 2 and 3 to illustrate. The exponents controlling the asymptotic behaviour in Eqs. (13)

are all consistent with respect to each other, and have been checked numerically up to quite
large values of α ≤ 108 . Note ﬁnally that the scaling results are valid in this high range of

α values, but are inadequate in the range of ∼ 1 ≤ α ≤∼ 500.

IV. SIMULATIONS AND COMPARISON WITH THE BOEDER EQUATION

In this section, Brownian simulations are presented to obtain the PDF, and a comparison

is made with the results of Section 3. The simulation is characterised by the presence of

both Brownian and hydrodynamic forces acting on the macromolecule in the dilute solution.

The hydrodynamic forces tend to act on the rod-like particles turning them in the shear ﬂow

with an average angular speed w, given, [3], for any orientation θ, by

w = ˙γsin2(θ)

(19)

where ˙γ is the constant shear rate of the linear ﬂow. To simulate the eﬀects of hydrody-

namic forces in an interval ∆t(n + 1; n); between successive simulation events, we compute

∆θhyd(n + 1; n), that is the hydrodynamic rotation about the centre of mass of the rod-like

particles, using the following algorithm:

∆θhyd(n + 1; n) = θ(tn+1) − θ(tn) − ˙γsin2(θ)∆t(n + 1; n)

(20)

∆θhyd(n + 1; n) is always positive, following the direction of the hydrodynamic ﬂow.

In contrast the Brownian forces in the bulk create a diﬀusive rotational motion of the

macromolecules over the orientations θ. The Brownian variable ∆θBr(n + 1; n) may be given

from a random Gaussian distribution. It turns out, however, that it is more convenient to

work with a simpliﬁed Monte Carlo random variable

∆θBr(n + 1; n) = ±∆θBr

(21)

where ∆θBr is a ﬁxed value for a group of simulation runs, for a given α. An appropriate

random number generator is used in the algorithm to select random events, avoiding cu-

mulative errors. The ﬁxed value ∆θBr must satisfy the Brownian condition corresponding

to a simulation interval ∆t(n + 1; n) ≫ 1/δrot where δrot = kBT /[DBrIcm] and Icm is the

moment of inertia of the rod-like particles about their centre of mass. Using this procedure

∆t(n + 1; n) may be given as a virtual variable

∆θ2

Br(n + 1; n) = 2DBr∆t(n + 1; n)

(22)

8

where DBr is the coeﬃcient of rotational diﬀusion, [10]. ∆t(n + 1; n) may be elimi-

nated now from the algorithm. This procedure avoids ambiguities that may arise owing to

the arbitrary choice of simulation time intervals, [5], and Eq. (20) is used to rewrite the

hydrodynamic algorithm component as

∆θhyd(n + 1; n) = α sin2(θ)[∆θ2

Br/2]

(23)

Typically ∆θBr is of the order of 0.005 radians, which engenders reasonable elementary

hydrodynamic rotations in the interval [0, π]. This is adequate to construct viable statistics,

[11], for the diﬀusion of macromolecules in solution. In Figs. 1-4, the simulation results for

the PDF are also presented for values of α= 100, 1000, 2000, and 5000, respectively, here as

the black dots. For any given α, the simulation results are obtained as an average over several
simulations, each based upon 108 hydrodynamic and stochastic events. The black dots are

then mean values, and the error bars are the maximum uncertainty per mean value. The

PDF simulations results are presented in comparison with the Boeder diﬀerential equation

solutions of the PDF, given as the continuous curves in these ﬁgures. Both are normalised to

unity. Other comparisons of this kind between the simulations and the analytical approach

have been made for other α values in a wide range, though not presented here.

V. CONCLUSIONS

The Boeder probability density function describing the average orientations of macro-

molecules in a ﬂowing liquid is accurately determined over a wide range of α = ˙γ

DBr , the
ratio of the hydrodynamic shear rate to the rotational diﬀusion coeﬃcient. The diﬀering

nature of macromolecules in their solutions leads to diﬀering diﬀusion coeﬃcients DBr,

whereas the hydrodynamic ﬂow of the solution may be characterised by diﬀering values

of

˙γ. Special analytical as well as numerical methods are developed and presented in

order to calculate accurately this probability distribution function for a wide range of
10−6 ≤ α ≤ 108 . Scaling results are also presented valid for α ≥ 103 . The mathematical

nature of the ordinary diﬀerential equation that the PDF should satisfy is revealed as a
singular perturbation problem when a becomes larger than about 103.

Brownian simulations are also presented and may be shown to agree with the numerical

solutions of the Boeder diﬀerential equation in the bulk of the ﬂowing liquid for arbitrary

9

values of α. This comparison conﬁrms the solidity of the analytical solutions.

It serves

equally as a necessary limiting reference for this type of simulation near impenetrable solid

surfaces where the simulations become a particularly useful tool, the Boeder problem being

analytically intractable in this region.

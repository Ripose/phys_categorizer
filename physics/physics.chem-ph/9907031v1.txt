We present a perturbative approach within the scope of
Kohn-Sham density functional theory (DFT). The method is
based on the exact exchange-only optimized eﬀective poten-
tial method, and correlation is included via perturbation ex-
pansion using Rayleigh-Schr¨odinger (RS) perturbation theory
(PT). The correlation potential is constructed from Møller-
Plesset formulation of RS calculations. This naturally leads
to a new iterative scheme when ﬁnite order perturbation the-
ory is employed. The new iterative procedure can be taken as
a self-consistent parameter-free DFT PT, and, as such, pro-
vides correlation energy which is explicitly functional of the
self-consistent orbitals, eigenvalues and also of the exchange-
correlation potential. As a demonstration, terms up to the
second order in the PT expansion are considered and the
explicit formula for the second order correlation potential is
given as well.

I. INTRODUCTION

Kohn-Sham (KS) density functional theory (DFT) is a
formally exact treatment of the many-body problem [1].
Kohn and his co-workers showed that the exact equations
of quantum mechanics, taking into account all the elec-
trons in a molecule (or solid) can be replaced by simpler
equations in which only the density of electrons at each
point in space enters [1]. Remarkable success has been
achieved in the last decades in ﬁnding the ”missing link”
of KS-DFT, the accurate exchange-correlation energy
functional Exc[ρ]. The possibility of further improve-
ments of model functionals, however, seems to be rather
limited within the scope of the so-called second gener-
ation of DFT, in which the kinetic energy is expressed
in terms of orbitals, while the exchange-correlation en-
ergy Exc as an electron density functional. Furthermore,
”state-of-the art” exchange-correlation energy function-
als Exc[ρ] and potentials vxc(r), such as the generalized
gradient approximation (GGA) [2] suﬀer from serious
problems since they do not exhibit the correct − 1
r long-
range and quadratic behaviour at small r [3,4].
It be-
came also apparent that GGA is not able to reproduce
exchange-correlation energies and potentials simultane-
ously with the accuracy provided by the energy function-
als [4]. All this indicates that although density gradient
treatments have had some success, they are not suﬃ-
ciantly well developed at present to provide a ﬁnal answer
to the problem of determining the exchange-correlation

contribution to the ground-state energy functional or to
the one-body potential [5].

A new generation of DFT, the optimized eﬀective po-
tential method (OEP) [6,7], opens a new horizon towards
fully local and exact mean-ﬁeld theory, where not only
the kinetic energy but also the exchange-correlation po-
tential and the exchange-correlation energy are treated
at the orbital dependent level of theory. The eﬃcient
and highly accurate KLI approximation to OEP pro-
vides an eﬃcient computational tool for the scientiﬁc
community. OEP and KLI build up correct − 1
r assymp-
totics and the highest occupied orbital energy satisﬁes
Koopmans-theorem and also provides self-interaction free
exchange-correlation potential vxc(r) [3]. However, the
theory is exact at the exchange-only level and electron
correlation can only be added via approximate corre-
lation energy functionals [8].
It must be emphasized
that the correlation energy functionals neither in their
local nor in gradient corrected form are likely to work in
combination with exact exchange. This is because ba-
sically none of the common correlation functionals have
a long-range component in the corresponding correlation
hole (the combined exchange-correlation hole is typically
short-ranged). The Colle-Salvetti gradient corrected cor-
relation functional [9], which provided excellent results
for atoms, performed rather badly for molecules due to
the abovementioned reason [8]. Approximate correlation
functionals, which are derived from the homogeneous
or inhomogeneous electron gas model or obtained non-
empirically from sum-rule conditions, exhibit incorrect
long-range tail (only dynamical correlation is accounted
for). Those functionals also build up improper local
behaviour in atoms and molecules and their success is
mainly due to the cancellation of errors with diﬀerrent
sign [4,10]. Therefore, the correlation eﬀect can only be
calculated in a more complicated way than in the second
generation of DFT in those methods which work with
exact exchange (e.g. HF and OEP) [20].

A few extensions of the OEP method have been made,
which allow the treatment of electron correlation in a lim-
ited way. In recent years much eﬀort has been devoted to
the formulation of perturbation theory (PT) on KS basis.
Recently Rayleigh-Schr¨odinger PT has been employed
for the DFT correlation energy using explicit coupling-
constant dependence in the model Hamiltonian within
the KS density functional picture [11]. The G¨orling-
Levy scheme and OEP provide the exact treatment of
the exchange-only KS problem and also provide an alter-
native to the Hartree-Fock theory. Casida, on the other

1

hand, employed an approximate perturbative expression
for the ground state to include correlation in OEP [12] us-
ing a formalism based on the work of Sham and Schl¨uter
[13]. In a recent review of OEP, Grabo et al. proposed
a scheme which also makes use of many-body pertur-
bation theory (MBPT) on exchange-only OEP reference
state using Green’s functions and the Dyson equation
[14]. Very recently, Engel et al. worked out the rela-
tivistic generalization of OEP and used Møller-Plesset
based correlation [15]. Aashamar et al. gave the exten-
sion of OEP approach which, permits the treatment of
correlation in a limited way at the multiconﬁgurational
self-consistent ﬁeld (MCSCF) level of theory [17]. How-
ever, this approach met little practicle relevance being
extremely time-consuming and also diﬃcult to relate to
the single determinent nature of KS DFT.

The density functional perturbation theory worked out
by X. Gonze et al. [18], which can be taken as a variation-
perturbation procedure. In this as well as in other the-
ories [11] the self-consistent procedure led to the Kohn-
Sham wave function being dependent on the perturbation
theory. Thus the perturbation comes into play at an ear-
lier stage than in conventional quantum chemical pertur-
bation theory (e.g. Møller-Plesset perturbation theory).
Also, Holas and March expressed the exact exchange-
correlation potential in terms of ﬁrst- and second or-
der density matrices using the G¨orling-Levy perturbation
theory [19]. All these methods appear somewhat complex
in detail and it is presently diﬃcult to predict which one
will prove the most convenient for practical application
and implementation [19].

The Kohn-Sham formalism for ground states is based

on the noninteracting Schr¨odinger equation

[ ˆT + ˆvs]Φ = EKS

s Φ,

(1)

the KS equation, where ˆvs is the N -electron opera-
tor which corresponds to a local multiplicative potential
vs(r) as a consequence of the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem
[1]. The one-body KS potential vs(r) is determined, up to
an additive constant, by the requirement that the ground
state of the KS Hamiltonian operator ˆT +ˆvs, the KS wave
function Φ, yields the same electron density ρ(r) as the
ground state of the corresponding interacting real system.
Φ can be composed of N spin orbitals ui as a single Slater
determinant for nondegenerate systems. Therefore, the
following spinrestricted Kohn-Sham single-particle ap-
proach is considered for fermionic systems (we have omit-
ted spin-dependency, but the extension of the theory is
straightforward for that case, throughout a.u. is used):

[−

∇2 + vs(r)]ui(r) = ǫiui(r)

(2)

where vext is the potential external to the electronic sys-
tem that includes the one created by nuclei, vH is the
Coulomb potential due to the classical electron-electron
repulsion and vxc is a nonclassical term, the exchange-
correlation contribution to the the KS one-body poten-
tial.

In this article we would like to study a more general
class of KS potentials. In a general sense, the exchange-
correlation part of the KS potential is not a pure density
functional but rather a complicated functional of eigen-
values and of single particle orbitals [20],

vs([ρ], r) = vs([ρ, {ui}, {ǫi}], r)
= vext([ρ], r) + vH ([ρ], r)
+vxc([ρ, {ui}, {ǫi}], r)

(4)

In addition to this, in the section V we will show that
the exchange-correlation energy Exc is even more com-
plicated energy functional being the explicit functional
of the exchange-correlation potential vxc(r) as well,

Exc = Exc[{ui, ǫi}, vxc].

(5)

The same conclusion is derived by others [14]. As demon-
strated by G¨orling and Levy [11], it is not necesseraly im-
portant to know how the exchange-correlation potential,
based on the eigensolutions of the KS equations, depends
on the density. Those potentials are always implicitly
functionals of the density.

To derive vxc formally, we write Exc rigorously

Exc[ρ] =

0

dλ

Z

dr′dr ρ(r)ρ(r′)[gλ([ρ]; r, r′) − 1]

,

|r − r′|

(7)

where gλ([ρ]; r, r′) can be interpreted as the pair corre-
lation function of the ﬁctitious system with interaction
strength parameter (coupling constant) 0 ≤ λ ≤ 1 and a
ground state density which is independent of λ [1,4]. The
exchange-correlation potential vxc is formally deﬁned as
the functional derivative

vxc(r, [ρ]) =

δExc[ρ]
δρ(r)

.

Because of the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem, there exists a
one-to-one mapping between the single particle KS po-
tentials vs(r) and the densities ρ(r) which guarantees
that the functional derivative given by Eq. (7) is deﬁned
[1]. However, the functional derivation can not be ob-
tained explicitly, since one has to derive the following
expression [4]:

where ui(r) and ǫi are the single particle orbitals and
eigenvalues for a fermionic system and vs(r) is the eﬀec-
tive Kohn-Sham single particle potential [1].

vxc(r, [ρ]) =

vs(r) = vext(r) + vH (r) + vxc(r),

The ﬁrst term of the potential is the so-called potential
part of the exchange-correlation energy [4], which is iden-
tical with Slater’s potential in the exchange-only (x-only)
case, i.e. for gλ approximated by gλ=0, and which is ex-
actly known [23] as an orbital dependent quantity. The
response like second term contains the fundamental func-
tional derivative of the pair correlation function which is,
however, an unknown functional. The functional deriva-
tive Eq. (7) can be calulated only for approximate func-
tionals analitically where explicit dependence on the den-
sity ρ is known and therefore to be applied only for the
so-called second generation of DFT [14]. In the third gen-
eration of DFT one uses Ex[{ui}] rather than Ex[ρ] so
that not only the kinetic energy but the exchange energy
is expressed as orbital dependent energy functionals. The
correlation energy must be determined, though as a den-
sity functional [4,14]. The central equation in the third
generation of DFT is still the KS Eq. (2) [20,14]. At the
best of our knowledge attempts have not yet been made
to express the exchange-correlation energy as a unique
orbital-dependent quantity Exc[{ui}] in OEP. Further-
more, a general theory to be set up, where both the
exchange-correlation potential and the energy are com-
plicated functionals of the self-consistent solutions of the
eigenvalue problem Eq. (2) in the spirit of Eqs. (3) and
(4).

In this work we give an explicit formulation of a pertur-
bation theory on top of exchange-only OEP. We derived
an explicit expression for the correlation potential given
by Krieger et al. [3].
In section II, we give the short
summary of OEP formalism, which we use extensively in
the further sections of this article. We give in sections
III-IV, the potential and response part of vxc (see Eq.
(7)) exactly. We formulate a self-consistent perturbation
theory on top of the exchange-only OEP reference state
(section V). We would also like to compare our OEP-PT
scheme with other DFT schemes obtained by perturba-
tion theory [11,15] in order to point out the similarities
and diﬀerences between them.

[14,22].

The optimized eﬀective potential method (OEP) is
given by Talman and Shadwick [7] for getting the ex-
act exchange potential vx(r). Formally, we make use of

The integral Eq. (12) is the fundamental expression for
vxc in OEP instead of Eq. (7), however, there is no known
analytic form of vxc[{ui}]. Therefore, only numerical so-
lutions are available for spherical atoms [3,7,14,16,17] and
for solids [25–27]. These numerical solutions of Eq. (12)
are conﬁned to the exchange-only OEP and correlation
has been taken into account only via approximate local
functionals [25]. At the best of our knowledge, the only
possibility to account for the correlation energy exactly
is the constrained search formulation of KS theory, when
one makes use of fully correlated density as a reference
density obtained from e.g. full CI calculations [4,10]. Al-
though such a calculation provides exact vxc, it repre-
sents an enormous computational task which can hardly
be carried out for systems of practical interest. G¨orling
and Levy have pointed out that Eq. (12) is the special
case of a more general equation [28].

In the work of Krieger and co-workers, the OEP inte-
gral equation is analyzed and a simple approximation is

made reducing the complexity of the original OEP equa-
tion signiﬁcantly, and, at the same time, keeping many of
the essential properties of OEP unchanged [3]. Krieger,
Li and Iafrate gave an exact expression by transforming
the OEP integral Eq. (7) into a manageable form. They
have got the following, still exact expression for vxc(r):

rather crude approximation, but it can be interpreted as

eraged over ground-state density vanish. It can be shown
that the KLI approximation can be derived alternatively
[21].

III. PERTURBATION EXPANSION OF THE
CORRELATION ENERGY ON TOP OF
EXCHANGE-ONLY OEP

(17)

Let us turn now to the discussion of how to include
electron correlation on top of exact exchange-only KS
theory. Our aim is to solve the exact KS scheme using
perturbation theory on top of a known ﬁrst order problem
(e.g. the x-only OEP). Here consider the Hamiltonian for
an N -electron system

ˆH = ˆT + ˆVee +

vext(ri),

i=1 − 1

2 ∇2

P

We consider the problem of improving the exchange-
only OEP energy of an N -electron system by means
of Rayleigh-Schr¨odinger (RS) perturbation theory. The
partition of the Hamiltonian is deﬁned H as

(18)

H = H0 + W

(21)

In particular, we treat W as a perturbation to the
exchange-only KS Hamiltonian H0 (H0 >> W). We
wish to solve the eigenvalue problem

ˆHΦ = ( ˆH0 + ˆW)Φ = EΦ,

(22)

which leads to a non-degenerate ground state for a system
of N -fermions. Φ is the ground state wavefunction and
E is the expectation value of the Hamiltonian given by
Eq. (20) and (21). Eq. (22) describes the corresponding
KS system, a model system of hypothetical noninteract-
ing electrons with the same ground-state electron density

4

as the real system [1,5,11]. However, we only know the
solution of the unperturbed problem

ˆH0Φs = E0Φs,

(23)

where ˆH0, Φs are the unperturbed reference Hamiltonian
and single determinent wavefunction. We assume that
Eq. (23) provides a complete set of eigenfunctions {ui}
with corresponding eigenvalues {ǫi} as well as the nonde-
generate ground energy state E0. In this article we treat
H0 as the exact exchange-only KS Hamiltonian, which is
known as the exchange-only OEP Hamiltonian. Actually,
the solutions of exact x-only OEP are equivalent to the
solutions of the exact x-only KS equations [14]. The cen-
tral idea is now to determine the perturbation operator
ˆW as a functional derivative with respect to the electron
density ρ (Eq. (7)).

ˆW = W (r) =

δ(E − hΦs| ˆH0|Φsi)
δρ

= ˆVee(r) − vH (r) − vx(r).

Therefore, the perturbation operator ˆW is treated as a
local potential W (r). The calculated operator ˆW can
be then substituted back to the Hamiltonian given by
Eq. (21) and the eigenvalue problem (Eq. (22)) can be
solved. The unknown ground state energy E in Eq. (24).
is expressed by RS perturbation theory.
In section V
we give the details of this iterative scheme, in particu-
lar when the reference state is the exchange-only OEP
method.

We treat vs([ρ]; r) in this article as an explicit func-
tional of the eigensolutions {ui, ǫi} of the single particle
Hamiltonian (to be interpreted as the KS one). There-
fore, the unknown potential vxc is implicit functional of
the ground state density according to the Hohenberg-
Kohn theorem [1]. Its uniqueness is also guaranteed by
the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem. vs([ρ]; r) in Eq. (2) is a
one-body operator and Eq. (23) reduces to one-particle
equations for KS single particle orbitals ui(r) as given by
the noninteracting one-particle Schr¨odinger Eq. (2) with
the exact x-only KS one-body operator vxOEP
. The KS
single determinant, Φs, in Eq. (23) is then formed from
all occupied one-particle KS orbitals, {ui}, i.e., the N en-
ergetically lowest solutions to Eq. (23) with N being the
number of electrons in the system of interest. Eq. (22) re-
duces to exact one-particle KS equations given by Eq. (2)
with the exact KS one-body operator vs(r). Further-
more, the one-body potentials, which correspond to the
x-only reference state (vxOEP
) as well as to the exact
(correlated) case (vKS
) together with the Hamiltonians
H0 and H, are unique functionals of the v-representable
density. However, it must be emphasized that the x-only
OEP will result in ground state density diﬀerent from the
exact KS scheme given in Eq. (22).

The functional derivation given by Eq. (24) can not be
carried out directly due to the diﬃculties given in Eqs.
(7)-(8). The derivative is directly not accessible since Exc

is known only in terms of the one-particle KS states {ui}
and the eigenvalues {ǫi}, and the explicit functional de-
pendence of the KS eigensolutions on the electron density
is unknown. OEP provides an alternative way of getting
the local operator ˆW(r). The solution of Eq. (23) is
identical with the solution of Eq. (12) for exchange-only
OEP. Therefore, we chose the following partition of H
according to Eq. (22),

H0 =

IV. THE CORRELATION ENERGY AND
POTENTIAL AT SECOND ORDER

Because of the increasing complexity of perturbation
expansion, we give here only the MP perturbation energy
at second order. For a general case one can give (in prin-
ciple) those quantities at higher order as well. Note that
one has to consider not only double excitations but also
single conﬁgurations. In case of HF theory E(2),single
= 0
by Brillouin theorem, but in case of KS self-consistent or-
bitals we still have to calculate it [30–32]. This term does
not vanish completely but must be rather small for KS
orbitals as well. For a closed-shell system, the second-
order energy can be written in terms of sums over spatial
orbitals as

Φs is the N -electron Kohn-Sham ground-state single

the Kohn-Sham equation is given by Φs,r. The ex-

vanishes when i = j or k = l.

V. THE SELF-CONSISTENT PERTURBATION
SCHEME

c

Having discussed the partition scheme and the formu-
lation of nth-order xc-potential, we would like to study
(39). This scheme allows
the procedure given by Eq.
one to improve the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the
unperturbed problem systematically. The nth-order cor-
relation potential v(n)
(r) (Eq. (33)), which is calculated
on top of the ﬁrst-order level of perturbation theory,
is substituted back to the exchange-only KS equation
in order to achieve self-consistency in the ﬁeld of v(n)
.
The introduction of v(n)
via Eq. (33) together with Eq.
(39) opens a new variational freedom in the original KS
Eq. (2), which leads to a new iterative scheme. A new
v(n)
can then also be constructed on top of the variation-
c
ally solved correlated KS-problem, however, this would
lead to a more complicated iterative scheme.

c

c

The iterative scheme given by Eq. (39) is working in

(i) one has to solve the ﬁrst order level of theory which
is exactly the exchange-only OEP reference state in this
particular case providing the set of orbitals and eigenval-
ues, {ui} and {ǫi}.

(ii) the next step is the construction of the nth-
order correlation energy (Eq. (31)) and the exchange-
correlation potential v(n)
xc on top of the exchange-only
reference state (Eqs. (18) and (33)).

(iii) substituting back the potential v(n)

obtained in
step (ii) to the KS equation a new correlated KS problem
In this way a new set of eigensolution
can be solved.
{ui, ǫi} can be obtained. One can stop at this point,
when the nth-order correlated KS problem is solved, and

c

+[kl|j]hij|kli

the following way:

the ground state energy can then be calculated by Eq.
(9).

c

and v(n)

(iv) Although present paper is addressed to the formu-
lation of a standard perturbation theory on top of x-only
OEP (steps i-iii), we indicate that further iterative steps
can also be considered in practice when n 6= ∞. The
orbitals {ui} and the potential vx obtained in step (iii)
diﬀer from those obtained in step (i). Therefore, a new
E(n)
can be calculated which, however, leads
c
to a KS problem again. This procedure continues until
convergency is reached, provided, of course, that such a
method turns out to be convergent. These additional it-
erative steps with the ”updated” v(n)
result, however,in
the change of the unperturbed problem. This would lead
to the change of the partition scheme, the formula given
by Eq. (40) for E(n)
e.g. at second order of PT. There-
fore, in Eq. (40) vOEP (r) contains not only vx but also
v(2)
c (r) so that,

c

c

ˆW (2)(r) = ˆVee(r) − ˆvOEP (r) + v(2)

c (r).

(49)

Here we restrict ourself to the discussion of iterative
procedure with only unchanged partition scheme of the
Hamiltonian. The more comprehensive discussion of such
a RS scheme with improved partition of the Hamiltonian
can be the subject of further studies.

c

The solutions of the correlated KS equation obtained
in step (iii) can only be taken as ﬁnal solutions of Eq. (39)
when inﬁnite order PT is employed for calculating v(n)
(n = ∞). This is because the RS theory is mathemat-
icaly equivalent representation of the full conﬁguration
interaction (full CI) theory [30] at inﬁnite order expan-
sion. In practice, only truncated perturbation expansions
can only be considered, and, as such, fast convergence in
the PT expansion is of great importance. Therefore, the
proper choice of the reference space is also important to
achieve rapid convergence [34]. Note that in this scheme
the reference state is subsequently optimized when steps
(i)-(iv) are used.

c

Like in standard Hartree-Fock or KS procedures, the
single particle Eq. (39) have to be solved iteratively un-
til self-consistency is reached. According to Eq. (33) the
scheme can be improved systematically by considering
higher order v(n)
. One of the main diﬀerences between
the original form of the RS scheme and which is given in
Eq. (39) is that in the OEP PT scheme the wave-function
and the eigenvalues are improved via the solution of the
nth-order KS problem. This theory never goes beyond
the single-determinant picture in the present form. Ex-
ctited conﬁgurations are considered, however, when cal-
culating E(n)
. This scheme alows one to drive
a system progressively from a noninteracting reference
state toward a fully correlated system. When step (iv)
is switched on, the orbitals {ui} and eigenvalues {ǫi} in
the RS expansion of E(n)
(Eq. (31)) are allowed to be
the updated ones in the RS perturbation expansion. The
scheme can therefore be considered as a self-consistent

and v(n)

RS perturbation problem (SC-RS OEP). An alternative
approach to carry out PT calculation self-consistently is
the variation-perturbation approach [18,34]. Within the
exact SC-RS OEP scheme self-consistency can be reached
once the exact vxc is evaluated. We hope that this itera-
tive scheme might have the ”charming feature” of includ-
ing the important part of electron correlation already at
the second order of the correlation energy. Normally, the
eigenvalue problem up to the ﬁrst order level of theory is
solved variationally. The iterative scheme (39) permits
getting the best optimized ﬁrst order reference state in
RS theory. The optimization of the reference state is ac-
complished by the reiteration of the updated xc-potential
and by the consequent solutions of the ”updated” KS
problems until convergency is reached in step (iv). The
self-consistent scheme given by Eq. (39) is similar to the
so-called density functional perturbation theory (DFPT)
[18] in that respect that succesive orders of perturbation
are obtained iteratively in both cases. However, DFPT
uses energy derivatives with respect to the ordering pa-
rameters as a variation-perturbation treatment.

G¨orling and Levy (GL) [11,28] have given more gen-
eral functional for Exc and for vxc on the basis of PT.
They found on KS basis that both the xc-energy and the
xc-potential must be complicated functionals of both or-
bitals and eigenvalues and also of a linear response func-
tion type inverse operator ˆG−1. However, the quantity
ˆG−1 is analytically unknown. The GL perturbation the-
ory can provide an exact formal Kohn-Sham scheme only
in basis set representation. Both the GL and the OEP
PT theories lead to the exact formal representation of
the KS equation, however, the construction of the nth-
order vxc is diﬀerent. In the GL PT a coupling constant
α dependent scheme links the noninteracting N -electron
system with the interacting real system where the elec-
tron density remains independent of α [28]. The correla-
tion potential and the energy are expressed in a Talyor
series with respect to the α. The OEP PT scheme is a
coupling-constant free formalism and the electron density
does not remain constant during the perturbation treat-
ment. The exchange-only OEP will result in diﬀerent
density from Eq. (39), although the diﬀerence may be
rather small. In OEP PT a particular form of vxc is used
given by Eq. (15), while in GL PT a more general, but
unknown form of vxc is used. The main advantage of the
present scheme is that the functional derivative Eq. (38)
is directly accesible and, therefore, the nth-order poten-
tial v(n)
can be given analitically. Both theories deliver
the exact exchange-correlation energy and potential or-
der by order. Holas and March give the leading term
of GL PT correlation potential in terms of ﬁrst and sec-
ond order density matrixes (2DM). The 2DM is also ex-
pressed by PT. They also derived an exchange-potential
which is free of the energy denominators ǫi − ǫk while
the corresponding expression in GL theory does contain
it [19]. The extension of relativistic exchange-only OEP
with perturbation theory has ﬁrst been suggested by En-
gel et al. very recently [15]. Although their scheme is

c

8

closely related to our OEP-PT approach, the construc-
tion of the correlation potential seems to be somewhat
diﬀerent. Not taking into account its relativistic features
functional derivatives appear in their approach with re-
spect to the eigenvalues which are not included in the
present scheme. We use Eq. (33) for the correlation po-
tential together with Eq. (38) which will lead to some-
what diﬀernet formula than that given by Engel et al..
Although they give a very accurate and detailed formu-
lation of the theory we belive that our approach is still
relevant for applications in the next future.

In our SC OEP PT scheme the exchange-correlation
potential can be given according to OEP method. The
most convenient way is to use the KLI approximation [3]
for the xc-potential according to Eq. (18). The exchange-
only KLI approximation given by Eq. (18) performs re-
markably well [3,14] providing nice agreement with the
Hartree-Fock total energies. In the GL scheme one has a
relatively complicated formula at the ﬁrst order level of
PT, e.g. at the exchange-only level using orbital, eigen-
value and ˆG−1 dependent exchange-potential. The SC
OEP-PT method uses the much simpler exchange poten-
tial according to Eqs. (15) and (29) which is only orbital-
functional. However, the OEP PT scheme given in Eq.
(39) leads to completely exact theory when the last term
in Eq. (15), which is neglected in the KLI approxima-
tion, is calculated as well. Although the integrodiﬀer-
ential equation Eq. (12) can be solved only numerically,
however, its exact transformation given by Eq. (15) can
be computed exactly for arbitrary fermionic system. The
neglected term in Eq. (15), when considered, can increase
the computational diﬃculties signiﬁcantly.

correlation potential v(n)
by Eq. (39),

(50)

c

This is because in steps (iii) and (iv) in Eq. (39) the cor-
related KS problem is solved using the ”updated” v(n)
.
This equation reﬂects the complexity of the eigenvalue
problem given by Eq. (38). Also, Eq. (50) demonstrates
the diﬀerence of the SC-RS OEP scheme from the origi-
nal formulation of the RS perturbation theory. The ex-
panded nth order correlation energy is explicit functional
not only of the self-consistent orbitals and the eigenval-
ues, but also of the self-consistent exchange-correlation
potential. Similar results are reported on Sham-Schl¨uter
basis [13,14] and by Engel et al. [15]. In that and other
studies the variational energy expression has been treated
as the functional of the fully dressed Green function G
and of the reference function G0, and they are associated
with the Dyson equation [12].

VI. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper we have introduced a ﬁrst-principle,
parameter-free perturbational density functional scheme
in which all exchange-correlation eﬀects are consistently
represented in terms of the eigensolutions of the Kohn-
Sham equations. A self-consistent formulation of pertur-
bation theory is developed on top of the exchange-only
optimized eﬀective potential (OEP) method. This gener-
alization of OEP opens a new variational freedom which
leads to a new iterative procedure. The total energy is
also the functional of the nth-order exchange-correlation
potential. In this scheme, the correlation energy and the
correlation potential is expressed via perturbation series
while the orbitals and the eigenvalues are variationally
optimized via the Kohn-Sham equation. We give exactly
the potential and the response parts of the exchange-
correlation potential which are explicitly functionals of
the eigensolutions of the Kohn-Sham eigenvalue problem.
The correlation potential is given directly as a functional
derivative over the Møller-Plesset correlation energy ex-
pression with respect to the Kohn-Sham orbitals.

We also discuss the diﬀerence and similarities between
the present and other perturbation theories which are
also based on Kohn-Sham orbitals.

Further investigations will be fruitful starting from
the formalism introduced concerning the selection of the
most appropriate reference state, the Hamiltonian par-
tition scheme and the convergence of the RS PT based
on OEP. We would like to emphasize the utility of Eq.
(39) as a way of improving Kohn-Sham eigenvalues for
calculations of band gaps, ionization potentials and ex-
citation energies. The self-consistent OEP PT scheme
introduced here can be useful in a wide range of areas in
quantum chemistry and in solid state physics. Whether
the present approach can be really competitive among
known high accuracy but costly approaches, such as con-
ﬁguration interaction (CI), will be hopefully the subject
of further tests in the future.

APPENDIX

In order to get the second-order correlation potential
one has to derive the single excitation components which
occur when we are dealing with a ”one-body” single par-
ticle Hamiltonian. In Hartree-Fock theory single particle

9

excitations do not play a role in the second order PT cor-
relation energy formula because hΦs| ˆW |Φik
s i = 0 where
Φik
s is the single excited determinent wave function. How-
ever, its magnitude and contribution to the second-order
correlation energy in PT-DFT must be rather small as
well. Further arguments in this respect can be given only
computationally.

For simplicity, we give here the terms in conjuction with
the remarkable KLI approximation [3], therefore the last
term given in Eq. (15) is neglected. However, this term
is rather small [3,14] and can be accounted for when high
numerical accuracy is required.

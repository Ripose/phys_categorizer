The reported enhanced singlet-exciton yields in light-emitting polymers over the statistical limit
of 25% has attracted wide experimental and theoretical attention. Most theoretical estimates of
the singlet-exciton yield depend crucially on estimates of the inter-system crossing rates induced
by spin-orbit coupling.
In this paper we use the experimentally determined phosphorescent life-
time and energy of the lowest-lying triplet state, as well as calculated values of Huang-Rhys factors
to estimate the spin-orbit matrix element and inter-system crossing time between the lowest-lying
singlet and triplet states.

PACS numbers: 78.67.-n, 77.22.-d

The reported enhanced singlet-exciton yields in light-emitting polymers over the statistical limit of 25% has attracted
wide experimental and theoretical attention. See the reviews1 and2 for references to the experimental and theoretical
work. Most theoretical estimates of the singlet-exciton yield depend crucially on estimates of the inter-system crossing
rates induced by spin-orbit coupling. A determination of this rate would therefore be useful in attempting to resolve
the issue of whether or not the singlet exciton yield is enhanced in light emitting polymers. In this paper we make an
estimate of this rate. We determine the spin-orbit matrix element between the lowest excited singlet and triplet states
from the phosphorescence life-time of the triplet state. We use this matrix element to determine the inter-system
crossing rate using the Fermi golden rule.

Emission occurs from the ‘triplet’ state, T1, because it acquires some singlet character as a result of the mixing with
the ‘singlet’ state, S1, induced by spin-orbit coupling, HSO. Thus, the experimentally determined lifetimes of S1 and
T1 can be used to estimate the matrix element of the spin-orbit coupling,
, and hence τISC . Assuming
that the spin-orbit coupling is much smaller than the exchange energy, ∆, we can employ perturbation theory.

The expression for the ratio of the life-times is therefore

The Huang-Rhys factors required for the determination of X (Eq (19)) are estimated from density matrix renor-
malization group calculations of the Pariser-Parr-Pople-Peierls model for poly(p-phenylene) oligomers4. We ﬁnd for
0.9. In PPV-DOO the radiative lifetimes of S1
short oligomers (4
is 200 ps5, while ∆ES1 = 2.6 eV5, ∆ET1 = 1.5eV6, and thus ∆ = 1.1 eV. In PPP derivatives the radiative life time
of T1 is of order one second7.

Using these values in Eq. (20) gives
Inter-system crossing from S1 to T1 is an iso-energetic transition from the lowest vibrational level of S1 to the
vibrational level, ν, of T1 at the same energy. The rate, kISC, induced by spin-orbit coupling is given by the Fermi
Golden Rule expression (see, for example ref8):

Now, ν = 1.1/0.2 = 5.5 and taking S = 1.1 one ﬁnds that spin-orbit coupling τISC is 5 µs. This rate is very low, and
is not compatible with a triplet yield under photo-excitation of a few percent.

Notice that inter-system crossing between S1 and T1 is inhibited by the exponentially small Franck-Condon factor
arising from the large exchange energy between these states. However, inter-system crossing between quasi-degenerate
states is not inhibited by this factor. It is highly likely that there is a higher lying pseudo-momentum counterpart to
T1, Tn say, close in energy to S1 (see, for example refs9 and10). Inter-system crossing to Tn would rapidly yield T1
excitons via eﬃcient inter-conversion mechanisms. Assuming that S1 and Tn are quasi-degenerate the inter-system
crossing time between these states is approximately 500 times smaller than that between S1 and T1, namely
10
ns. Such a time is compatible with a triplet yield of a few percent. This value is also consistent with an inter-system
crossing time of 4 ns quoted in ref11.

∼

In conclusion, we have estimated the intersystem crossing time between quasi-degenerate states in the lowest singlet
and triplet manifolds to be
10 ns. Some theories assume that intersystem crossing between the higher lying quasi-
degenerate charge transfer excitons is responsible for the enhanced singlet exciton yield (see, for example ref12). The
calculation presented here does not directly address this intersystem crossing time, however it is perhaps reasonable
to assume that both rates are comparable.

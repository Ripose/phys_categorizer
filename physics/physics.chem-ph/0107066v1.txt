Abstract

We perform an extrapolative analysis of “fast-growth” free-energy-diﬀerence (∆F )
estimates of a computer-modeled, fully-solvated ethane↔methanol transformation.
The results suggest that extrapolation can greatly reduce the systematic error in ∆F
estimated from a small number of very fast switches. Our extrapolation procedure uses
block-averages of ﬁnite-data estimates, and appears to be particularly useful for broad,
non-Gaussian distributions of data which produce substantial systematic errors with
insuﬃcient data. In every tested case, the extrapolative results were better than direct
estimates.

1 Introduction

Relative free energy computations have long been of interest, and biological applications
promise to be of particular importance [1, 2, 3]. As examples, it would be desirable to
accurately and rapidly estimate free energy changes resulting from the opening of an ion
channel, the binding of a ligand, and alchemical mutation among a series of protein ligands.
Ligands might include potential drug compounds or varying sequences of nucleic acids (RNA
and DNA). Strategies for computing free energy diﬀerences date back to Kirkwood [4] and
Zwanzig [5] who pioneered thermodynamic integration and free-energy perturbation strate-
gies. Many computational strategies have since been developed for molecular systems (e.g.,
[1, 2, 3]).

“Fast-growth” methods [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13] are the focus of the present paper.
The impetus for these approaches comes from the work of Reinhardt, Hunter, and coworkers
[6, 7] who recognized that computations could readily employ a microscopic analog of the
inequality between work and free energy. The principle is readily illustrated in an “alchem-
ical” context where one wishes to compute the free energy diﬀerence between two systems
described by diﬀerent potential energy functions, U0 and U1, and parameterized by the
switching variable λ according to an extended potential function:

U(x; λ) = U0(x) + λ[ U1(x) − U0(x) ] ,

0 ≤ λ ≤ 1 ,

where x is a set of conﬁgurational coordinates. If one performs a series of rapid “switches”
(described below) between the two systems using an amount of work W in each switch, the
free energy diﬀerence is bounded according to [14, 6]

− hW1→0i ≤ ∆F0→1 ≤ hW0→1i ,

where the h· · ·i brackets indicate averages over many switches starting from equilibrium
ensembles of either start (λ = 0) or end (λ = 1) systems. (The distinct “systems” could
also describe diﬀerent conformations of a single system constrained to distinct values of a
reaction coordinate.)

The potentially rapid, non-equilibrium events used to compute hW i in Eq. (2) thus
provide a computational estimate of the equilibrium quantity ∆F . However, the bounds will
not be tight unless the switches are suﬃciently slow, oﬀsetting some of the computational
savings.

Subsequent work by Jarzynski [9, 10] sidesteps, at least in principle, some of the limita-
tions by permitting direct computation of ∆F from a single set of rapid switches, via the
simple, exact relation,

e−∆F/kB T = (cid:10)e−W/kBT
However, estimates for ∆F generated using Eq. (3) are highly sensitive to small values of W
and signiﬁcant errors can arise when the width of the distribution of W values exceeds kBT
[11, 13]. Hummer’s recent work with a small molecular system concluded that little, if any,
advantage was gained from the fast-switching approach [13].

(cid:11) .

(3)

In the past improvements have been sought in the procedure for generating a set of work
values {W1, W2, . . .} to be analyzed according to Eq. (2) or (3). In particular, one can switch
between λ = 0 and 1 along arbitrary paths, perhaps using more than one switching pa-
rameter as initially discussed by Reinhardt and coworkers for the fast-switching approach by

[6, 7]. Subsequent exploration of optimal switching paths has been pursued by many workers
[15, 8, 12, 13]. In fact, the exploration of diﬀerent paths in alchemical free-energy compu-
tations pre-dates the fast-switching approach, and was pursued in free-energy-perturbation
and thermodynamic integration eﬀorts — e.g., [16, 17, 18].

The present study, by contrast, attempts to optimize the use of the data {W1, W2, . . .}
which has already been generated, by using a combination of block-averaging and extrapo-
lation. This additional statistical analysis is needed to bypass the systematic error inherent
in ﬁnite data samples [19, 20, 10]. Fig. 1 illustrates the basic points. The running averages
(solid lines) based on Eq. (3) exhibit erratic behavior, and it is essentially impossible to judge
from these whether the computation has converged to an answer. However, the same data
considered in block-averages (error bars) is well-behaved and, as seen below, well-deﬁned.
Only the block-averages could be considered for extrapolation to the “inﬁnite-data” limit.
Cases of insuﬃcient data requiring extrapolation are of great interest because the size of
biomolecular systems often makes relative free energy estimates extremely costly.

estimates for the free energy diﬀerence are plotted vs. the number of switches, N ≡ Nswitch.
The running averages [based on Eq. (3); solid lines] exhibit non-monotonic, rise-and-drop
behavior, while the block averages (deﬁned in Sec. 3; error bars) are monotonic and smooth.
Each block-average data point was computed using all 10,000 work (W ) values. The error
bars are twice the standard error of the mean (see Sec. 3), and represent roughly 90%
conﬁdence intervals [21]. Data from switches of 20 λ steps.

Following Jorgensen and Ravimohan [22] and Jarque and Tidor [8], we examine alchem-
ical mutations between methanol and ethane in explicit water solvent. The authors are
unaware of any previous application of Jarzynski’s relation to alchemical transformations in
a molecular system, although Hummer performed a methodical study of the inter-methane
distance dependence of the free energy [13].

Our results indicate that the combined use of block-averaging and extrapolation is very
promising and warrants additional investigation. The approach produces successful and

3

reasonably reliable relative-free-energy estimates even from very fast switches of only one
or two steps, which generate extremely broad, highly-non-Gaussian distributions of work
values. In every case we examined, extrapolation of the data yielded a better estimate than
direct averaging alone.

In outline, this Letter is organized as follows: Sec. 2 brieﬂy describes “fast-growth”
computations and gives simulation details. In Sec. 3 we deﬁne the block averages, and the
extrapolation procedure is discussed in Sec. 4. In Sec. 5 we summarize our results and discuss
future work, including potential applications of the approach to large biomolecular systems.
We also discuss implications for other approaches to free energy calculations.

2 Alchemical Free Energy Calculations

This section ﬁlls in some details regarding the theory governing an “alchemical” free en-
ergy change and its implementation using a rapid-switching strategy. Alchemical changes
are transformations between Hamiltonians which describe diﬀerent molecules; molecular iso-
merization is mathematically analogous but not considered here. The free energy diﬀerence
between the two states is formally given by the ratio of the partition functions according to

exp (−∆F0→1/kBT ) = R dx e−U1(x)/kB T
R dx e−U0(x)/kB T .

(4)

Jarzynski’s relation (3) is derived from this deﬁnition.

Free Energy Perturbation (FEP)

The so-called free-energy-perturbation (FEP) procedure for computing relative free energies
[4, 5, 23] is a well-established method for molecular systems [17, 18, 1, 2, 3] which we use
as a benchmark for understanding systematic errors. FEP computations entail a number of
equilibrium simulations performed at a set of ﬁxed values of λ; for example, our FEP result
quoted in Sec. 5 uses simulations at λ = 0.1, 0.2, . . . , 0.9. The total free energy change is
estimated as the sum of the incremental changes, which are computed based on the analog
of Eq. (3) involving hexp (−∆W/kBT )i, where ∆W is the work or energy diﬀerence between
conﬁgurations at diﬀerent λ values.

Fast-Growth Procedure

Fast-growth algorithms have been discussed in detail elsewhere (e.g., [9, 10, 11, 13]), so we
merely sketch the approach. The general procedure for computing a “fast-growth” free energy
diﬀerence — via Eq. (3) rather than (4) — begins with the generation of an equilibrium
ensemble of starting (λ = 0) conﬁgurations, perhaps by molecular dynamics simulation as
is done here. One proceeds by (i) choosing a conﬁguration from the equilibrium ensemble,
(ii) incrementing the potential energy function (1) to a new, greater value of λ (keeping the
conﬁguration ﬁxed) and (iii) relaxing the system at the new λ value. Steps (ii) and (iii)
are repeated until a value λ . 1 is reached. In our implementation, the λ increments in
(ii) are uniform and the relaxation stage (iii) consists of a single molecular dynamics (MD)
“relaxation” step, following the “fast-growth” convention [6, 11]. A uniform increment of
∆λ = 0.05, for instance, corresponds to 20 “λ steps” and would require 19 MD steps, as
none is necessary at λ = 1.

The work for any such switch is computed based only on the potential energy increments
i denotes the ﬁnal conﬁguration of the system

and not the relaxation dynamics. Thus, if xﬁn
after it is relaxed at the ith value λi, the work calculated from

i−1; λi−1(cid:1)(cid:3) ,

(5)

where the same conﬁguration is evaluated at two diﬀerent λ values. Finally, to evaluate the
averages in Eqs. (2) and (3), one uses additional members of the λ = 0 equilibrium ensemble
to generate subsequent values of W — starting from step (i), above.

Methanol↔Ethane Model and Simulation

Simulations of the methanol↔ethane “transmutation” were performed within the CHARMM
molecular dynamics package. Both methanol and ethane were modeled in the united-atom
picture: methanol was represented as a three-atom (C,O,H) molecule and ethane as a two-
atom (C,C) molecule. The solvent used 125 TIP3 water molecules (for both λ = 0 and 1) in a
periodically replicated box of (15.6 ˚A)3. To facilitate comparison with earlier studies, electro-
statics and van der Waals interactions were both shifted to zero at a cutoﬀ of 8 ˚A. Molecular
dynamics steps (performed at ﬁxed λ values) used the leapfrog Verlet algorithm. The same
simulation procedure and parameters were used for free energy perturbation calculations.

6

3 Block Averaging

While block-averaging is straightforward, its repeated application for growing block sizes
to a non-linear transformation — such as taking the log of an average of exponentials in
Jarzynski’s relation (3) — turns out to yield rich, well-behaved data: see Fig. 1. The
procedure and some implications are discussed now.

We construct block averages [20, 24, 10, 25] from a set of, say, Ntot work values

{W1, W2, . . . , WNtot} by applying Jarzynski’s relation (3) to a series of blocks, each containing
N ≡ Nswitch values. More speciﬁcally, we deﬁne the N-block-averaged estimate for the free
energy as

∆FN =

N
Ntot

Ntot/N

X
n=1

−kBT log he−W/kBT iN,n ≡ hfN i ,

where the individual block averages are deﬁned by

he−W/kBT iN,n =

e−Wi/kBT ≡ fN,n .

1
N

nN

X
i=(n−1)N +1

The ratio Ntot/N denotes the largest integer less than or equal to the literal fraction, and
is never less than 30 in our analysis. Because of potential correlations in the sequence
{W1, W2, . . . , WNtot} we randomly re-sort the values prior to computing the block results
presented here. We note that larger block sizes, N, could be considered with a bootstrap
[24] or subsampling [25] analysis.

The true free energy diﬀerence of Eq. (3) is ∆F = ∆F∞, and the other limit gives
the average work, hW i = ∆F1: see Fig. 1. In general, a ﬁnite value of N indicates that
the average in Eq. (7) is performed from a poor sample of the W distribution, with N
determining how much of the tails of the distribution are included in the average. However,
the averaging of these poor samples in Eq. (6) yields a well-deﬁned descriptor of the ﬁnite-N
statistics. In the present case, the Boltzmann-factor form ensures monotonic behavior, so
that

∆FN +1 ≤ ∆FN ,

the essence of which was noted by Jarzynski [10]; see also [20]. The usual relation between
the average work and free energy (2) is simply a weaker case of the more general inequality
(8).

The uncertainty in the ﬁnite-N free energy values, δ∆F , is estimated by twice the stan-

dard error of the mean,

which gives roughly a 90% conﬁdence interval [21]. This is the quantity used to compute
error bars and uncertainties.

4 Extrapolation

While extrapolation and data-ﬁtting are something of black arts, one can hope to derive
meaningful information with a careful error analysis [26]. Here we discuss some simple,
intuitively appealing schemes for extrapolating the block-averaged, ﬁnite-data free energies
(6) to the limit of inﬁnite data. The motivation for our approach is the analysis of ﬁnite-size
eﬀects in spin systems [27, 28].

Inspection of the data on a linear scale, such as Fig. 1, and in logarithmic plots suggests

the simplest ﬁt might be to a power law,

A natural, related form considers a power series

∆FN = ∆F∞ + a1(1/N)α1 .

∆FN = ∆F∞ +

bk(1/N)kβ1 ,

kmax

k=1

(10)

(11)

where the parameter β1 can be chosen from a ﬁt or some other way, such as by examining the
leading 1/N behavior. Our work with the form (11) uses three parameters with kmax = 2,
except where noted, and the ﬁxed exponent β1 = 0.266 chosen empirically, but based on
some of the values ﬁtted for α1 in Eq. (10). Naturally other exponents and polynomial
degrees could be used.

One drawback to these forms is clear: if the data do not include the leading 1/N behavior
and the “distance” to extrapolate is great (from 1/N = 0 to the ﬁrst data point; see Fig. 2),
the ﬁts will not have good extrapolative power. We anticipate that an analytic understanding
of the behavior of ∆FN (N) for model systems, to be pursued in future work, will shed light
on extrapolation forms and methods.

5 Results

We now present estimates for the free energy diﬀerence of the methanol→ethane trans-
formation, based on the block-averaging and extrapolation presented in the previous two
sections. Our focus is the methanol-to-ethane direction of the transformation because it is
more challenging and so presumably a better model for larger systems.

The basic results are surprising and exciting. First, successful extrapolation to reason-
ably accurate free energy values does appear to be possible in the methanol→ethane system.
Moreover, for ﬁxed amounts of computer time, the extrapolated estimates appear to be con-
siderably better than standard fast-growth values, and can avoid errors of several kcal/mole
resulting from insuﬃcient data. If borne out for other systems, the ability to make estimates
from a relatively small number of very rapid switches would mean dramatic eﬃciency gains.

average N ≡ Nswitch raised to a “scaling” power. The block averages, ﬁt, and direct estimate were
all computed from the same data, while the free-energy-perturbation (FEP) value was generated
from an independent, substantially longer calculation. The symbols roughly indicate the sizes of
the error bars. The block-averaging is described in Sec. 3, the extrapolative ﬁtting in Sec. 4, and
the direct estimate averages the same data according to Eq. (3). The data are from 103 switches
of 20 λ steps each, and note that kBT ≃ 0.6 kcal/mole.

Fig. 2 shows a sample extrapolation, based on Eq. (11), for 103 switches of 20 λ steps
each. Note that the un-extrapolated, “direct” free-energy estimate — based on application
of Eq. (3) to the same data — exceeds both the extrapolated value and the reliable FEP
estimate by 7 kcal/mole≃ 11kBT . Thus, with a limited amount of data, extrapolation of the
block-averaged values yields a much better estimate.

The estimates ∆F est and uncertainties are given in units of kcal/mole, and may be com-
pared to the free-energy-perturbation estimate of 5.3 ±0.16 kcal/mole. Direct estimates
are computed from Eq. (3) and power-series extrapolations from (11), using identical data.
The uncertainties in the extrapolations are discussed in Sec. 5. The bracketed values give
the diﬀerences between the direct ∆F estimates and the more costly FEP estimate in the
ﬁrst row, and hence measure the accuracy of the former. The quantity “λ steps” indicates
the number of increments in the alchemical coordinate: see Sec. 2. “Total Steps” gives the
number of MD steps excluding those for generating the equilibrium ensemble at λ = 0.

Table 1 presents quantitative results for the methanol-to-ethane transformation. The ex-
trapolations are uniformly superior to the direct estimates for any ﬁxed amount of computer
time and consistently avoid errors on the order of several kcal/mole (where 1 kcal/mole
≃ 1.6 kBT ) for smaller amounts of data. Total computer times for the tabulated results
range from 2 nsec. (104 switches of 200 steps) down to just 10 psec (104 2-step switches) of
non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulation. The “Total Steps” column does not include
the computer time expended on generating an equilibrium ensemble at λ = 0 because it is
unlikely that one would investigate the transmutation of a system which has not already
been subjected to an equilibrium study.

We estimated upper and lower bounds simply by extrapolating, independently, from
the sets of upper and lower limits of the conﬁdence intervals; recall Eq. (9). Statistical
uncertainties were not given for the direct estimates because the systematic error is clearly
more signiﬁcant than the statistical: the bracketed deviations in Table 1 indicate the direct
estimates diﬀer dramatically from the free-energy perturbation (FEP) result. Recall that
the FEP approach was outlined in Sec. 2.

The power of the extrapolative approach is underscored by the challenging character of
the distributions of work values under consideration. The distributions are all quite broad
and asymmetric: standard deviations range from 12 kcal/mole ≃ 20 kBT (for the 200-step
switches) to 24 kcal/mole ≃ 38 kBT (2 steps), and third moments range from 72% of the
standard deviation (200 steps) to 100% (2 steps). Thus, although all of the tabulated
simulations involve very rapid switches — of less than 1 psec. of molecular dynamics time
per switch — the substantial diﬀerences in the distributions indicate that the data sets are
quite distinct. We also noted a degree of robustness in trials with related but diﬀerent
forms and exponents β1 (results not shown) which typically yielded consistent, if slightly
inaccurate, results across data sets from widely disparate numbers of λ steps — and hence
disparate computer times and work distributions.

Despite the success of the ﬁtting form used here, superior extrapolations may be possible.
The forms employed here (see Sec. 4) are empirical, so a theoretical basis should provide
additional insight. Lacking that, a more systematic exploration of the implicit parameters
— the exponent β1 in (11), the minimum number of switches per block, and the degree of
the ﬁtting polynomial — would also be valuable.

Another interesting trend illustrated in the data of Table 1 is that for a ﬁxed amount
of computer time, direct estimates using fewer λ steps appear to give better results. The
statistical errors (data not shown) are also better for direct estimates using more rapid
switches.

6 Summary and Discussion

We have performed and analyzed extrapolative free energy estimates based on “fast-growth”
alchemical simulations of a fully solvated methane↔ethanol transformation. The results of
Table 1 suggest that the combined use of block-averaging (Sec. 3) and extrapolation (Sec. 4)
permits accurate estimates from a relatively small amount of data which — when analyzed
using the standard “direct” method — leads to unacceptably large systematic errors of
several kcal/mole. Extrapolated results, for our system, were always better than standard,
direct estimates. The approach also appears to be fairly robust, in that good results are
achieved over ranges both of overall computer time and of alchemical switching speeds.

Our work builds on that of Wood et al., who perceptively proposed a ﬁrst-order estimate
of the systematic errors due to ﬁnite samples of data [20]. The present method, however, is
not limited to narrow work (energy-change) distributions as noted in Sec. 5.

This Letter describes an initial exploration of a potentially important approach, and
a number of important issues and questions deserve further exploration. To name a few:
(i) undoubtedly, simultaneous ﬁts of forward (λ = 0 → 1) and reverse switching data will
provide more reliable free energy estimates; (ii) we have not performed a quantitative analysis
of the eﬃciency, both by comparison to standard “fast-growth” approaches as well as to free-
energy-perturbation estimates; (iii) how does the extrapolation approach generalize to larger
biomolecular systems? (iv) how universal are the behaviors of the ﬁnite-data estimates,
∆FN , considered in the extrapolation? (v) can theoretical scrutiny of simple models and
distributions clarify the extrapolative procedure? The ideas discussed here may also apply,
with suitable modiﬁcations, to perturbative calculations.

We have discussed methods for analyzing data from fast-switching simulations, but have
not broached the possibilities for improved sampling of data. There appear to be a number
Instead of using a uniform alchemical increment ∆λ,
of promising, unexplored avenues.
for example, one could adjust increments to ensure relatively constant work increments,
following the example of perturbative calculations [16, 17, 18, 29]; this approach could also
be adapted for higher-dimensional alchemical coordinates already considered by others [6, 7,
30, 8]. Improved sampling eﬃciency may also result from biasing the “relaxational,” ﬁxed-λ
dynamics to favor states with smaller work increments.

Finally, we note that the relationship between the approach described here and estab-
lished statistical methods needs to be elucidated. Elements of our approach, particularly
the construction of “ﬁnite-data” block averages, clearly have been considered in “bootstrap”
[24] and “subsampling” [25] statistical approaches. Nevertheless, the authors are not aware
of a similar practical — if ad hoc — technique for extrapolation to the inﬁnite-data limit
like that presented here.

Abstract

The notoriously small X 3Π − a 1Σ+ excitation energy of the BN diatomic has been calculated

using high-order coupled cluster methods. Convergence has been established in both the 1-particle

basis set and the coupled cluster expansion. Explicit inclusion of connected quadruple excitations

ˆT4 is required for even semiquantitative agreement with the limit value, while connected quintuple
excitations ˆT5 still have an eﬀect of about 60 cm−1. Still higher excitations only account for about
10 cm−1. Inclusion of inner-shell correlation further reduces Te by about 60 cm−1 at the CCSDT,
and 85 cm−1 at the CCSDTQ level. Our best estimate, Te=183±40 cm−1, is in excellent agreement

with earlier calculations and experiment, albeit with a smaller (and conservative) uncertainty. The

dissociation energy of BN(X 3Π) is De=105.74±0.16 kcal/mol and D0=103.57±0.16 kcal/mol.

INTRODUCTION

The lowest electronic excitation energy of the boron nitride diatomic is among the most

vexing problems in small-molecule computational chemistry. Not only are the X 3Π and

a 1Σ+ states nearly degenerate, but the combination of moderate multireference character

in the X 3Π state and pathological multireference character in the a 1Σ+ state makes the

transition energy Te excessively sensitive to the electron correlation treatment.

Martin et al.[1], using multireference average coupled pair

(ACPF)
techniques[3], found the 3Π state to be the ground state and predicted Te=381±100 cm−1.

functional

These authors also found that (nowadays) commonly used coupled cluster methods such

as CCSD(T)[4] yield qualitatively incorrect answers.

In an MRD-CI study, predicted

. Elaborate multireference calculations by Mawhinney, Bruna, and Grein (MBG)[2], by

Peterson[5], and by Bauschlicher and Partridge (BP)[6] obtained considerably lower Te
values of 241±160 cm−1, 190±100 and 180±110 cm−1, respectively. Watts[7], at the

CCSDT (coupled cluster with all single, double, and triple excitations[8]) level with a cc-
pVQZ (correlation consistent polarized quadruple zeta[17]) basis set, found Te=844 cm−1,

and conjectured that this serious overestimate was due to neglect of connected quadruple
( ˆT4) and higher excitations. Both Boese et al.[9] and Tajti et al.[10], in the context of

high-accuracy computational chemistry protocols developed in their papers, found that, in
strongly multireference systems, ˆT4 can easily make energetic contributions on the order of

the diﬀerence between the CCSDT and multireference values. (Denis[11] crudely estimated
the eﬀect of ˆT4 by assuming error cancellation with higher-order ˆT3 in the singlet but not
the triplet state, and predicted Te=175 cm−1.) Finally, a very recent quantum Monte Carlo
(QMC) study by Lu[12] in the present journal found 178(83) cm−1, where the uncertainty

band represents one standard deviation in the QMC approach.

The two most reliable experimental estimates are the noble gas matrix IR measurements
of Bondybey and coworkers[13], 15–182 cm−1, and the negative ion time-of-ﬂight
photoelectron spectroscopy value of Neumark and coworkers[14], 158±36 cm−1.

The purpose of the present work is to establish whether a converged result can be obtained

at all from single-reference coupled cluster methods, whether this estimate is in agreement

with the other theoretical approaches and experiment, and ﬁnally what is the breakdown of

various contributions in the cluster expansion.

II. COMPUTATIONAL DETAILS

All calculations were carried out using the general coupled cluster code MRCC of K´allay

and coworkers[15]. The Austin-Mainz version of ACES II[16] was used to generate the

required integrals and molecular orbitals. Unless otherwise noted, the CCSDT/cc-pVQZ
reference geometries of Watts[7] were used, re(X 3Π)=1.3302 and re(a 1Σ+)=1.2769 ˚A.

Correlation consistent[17] (cc-pVnZ), augmented correlation consistent[18] (aug-cc-

pVnZ), and core-valence correlation consistent[19] (cc-pCVnZ) basis sets were used

throughout. The largest such basis sets used, cc-pV5Z, is of [6s5p4d3f 2g1h] quality. Where

appropriate, contributions were extrapolated to the 1-particle basis set limit using the

A + B/L3 formula of Halkier et al.[20].

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

All computed values are given in Table I, compared with available experimental data.
As expected, the CCSD results are grossly biased towards the triplet state (Te=4432 cm−1
at the basis set limit). Inclusion of ˆT3 (connected triple excitations) is required for an even
qualitatively correct result, although even the CCSDT basis set limit Te=827 cm−1 is 3–4
times too large. Quasiperturbative ˆT3 corrections such as CCSD(T) overcorrect, and wrongly

predict a singlet ground state[1]. We conclude that CCSDT is the lowest acceptable level

of theory for the reference geometry. Comparison of the CCSDT/cc-pVQZ and CCSDT/cc-
pV5Z values suggests that the latter is converged to within 2–3 cm−1 with respect to the

basis set.

Inclusion of

(connected quadruple excitation) proved essential

for anything

ˆT4

approaching quantitative accuracy. The CCSDTQ/cc-pVQZ basis set calculations reported

here involve 419 and 391 million amplitudes, respectively, for the singlet and triplet states.

They ran for two weeks each on single AMD Opteron 846 processors. At the basis set limit,
ˆT4 reduces the transition energy by 514 cm−1. We do note — as we have previously noted[9]
for other strongly multireference systems like C2(X 1Σ+
g ) — that basis set convergence
for the ˆT4 contribution is fairly slow (unlike for systems dominated by a single reference

determinant[9]). This can be rationalized in terms of very prominent double excitations in

the singlet wavefunction: dynamical correlation relative to them will be dominated by double

3

excitations, which represent quadruple excitations relative to the reference determinant. At
the CCSDTQ basis set limit, we obtain Te = 313 cm−1, in agreement with Ref.[1] but still

considerably higher than the other results.

Connected quintuple excitations ( ˆT5) still reduce the excitation energy by about 70 cm−1.

Comparison of the cc-pVDZ and cc-pVTZ results for this contribution suggests that it

converges quite rapidly with the basis set.

Connected sextuple excitations only aﬀect Te by –8 cm−1, while the contribution of still

higher excitations was found to be negligible. Our best estimate for the valence-only FCI
basis set limit is therefore Te=243±28 cm−1, where our error bar is the sum of all the

amounts covered by extrapolations.

Somewhat surprisingly, the eﬀect of core-valence correlation is found to account for the

discrepancy with earlier theoretical studies and experiment. At the CCSDT level, it lowers Te
by 59±7 cm−1, while the diﬀerential ˆT4 core-valence contribution reduces Te by an additional
26±4 cm−1 at the CCSDTQ level. (The all-electron CCSDTQ/cc-pCVTZ calculations, at 1

billion amplitudes each, took about one day per iteration running OpenMP-parallel on four

AMD Opteron 846 CPUs. Sub-microhartree convergence requires about twenty iterations.

Our attempts to carry out CCSDT/cc-pCVQZ calculations met with failure for the triplet

state. Because of the clearly erratic basis set convergence behavior of the CCSD(T) energy

in this case, we have chosen not to use the larger basis set data at this level of theory.)

Our ﬁnal best estimate neglecting spin-orbit splitting thus becomes Te=158±40 cm−1, in

excellent agreement with the earlier calculations (which likewise neglect spin-orbit splitting,

it being almost an order of magnitude smaller than their stated uncertainties). Our error

bar is probably somewhat conservative, as it assumes that no cancellation at all would occur

between extrapolation errors in individual contributions.

The spin-orbit coupling constant of the X 3Π state is calculated as -24.27 cm−1 at

the CISD/cc-pVQZ (uncontracted, no g functions) level using MOLPRO[21], in excellent
agreement with the experimental value[22] of -25.14 cm−1. Its inclusion pushes up both the

present calculated value and all the earlier theoretical values by these amounts: our ﬁnal
best estimate thus becomes Te=183±40 cm−1. This agrees with the experimental value of

Neumark and coworkers[14] to within the respective uncertainties, and ﬁnds itself near the

upper edge of the interval given by Bondybey and coworkers[13].

Finally, as a byproduct of this study, we obtain the dissociation energy of BN(X 3Π) using

4

W4 theory[23] as De=105.74±0.16 kcal/mol and D0=103.57±0.16 kcal/mol (the uncertainty

being a 95% conﬁdence interval). This is somewhat higher than previous calculated De values

of 105.2 kcal/mol[1] and 104.2 kcal/mol[5]. The zero-point vibrational energy (ZPVE) of

2.17 kcal/mol was obtained by combining the accurate ωe and ωexe for the singlet state

from Ref.[24] with the state diﬀerence in ZPVE from Ref.[13]. In Ref.[23], %TAE[(T)], the

percentage of the total atomization energy resulting from (T), was proposed as an indicator

for the importance of nondynamical correlation eﬀects. We note that %TAE[(T)]=6.03%

for the X 3Π state (on the low end of moderate nondynamical correlation), compared to no

less than 18.63% for the a 1Σ+ state (among the most severe cases surveyed in Ref.[23]).

IV. CONCLUSIONS

Summing up, the notoriously small X 3Π−a 1Σ+ excitation energy of the BN diatomic has

been calculated using high-order coupled cluster methods. Convergence has been established

in both the 1-particle basis set and the coupled cluster expansion. Explicit inclusion of
connected quadruple excitations ˆT4 is required for even semiquantitative agreement with the
limit value, while connected quintuple excitations ˆT5 still have an eﬀect of about 60 cm−1.
Still higher excitations only account for about 10 cm−1. Inclusion of inner-shell correlation
further reduces Te by about 60 cm−1 at the CCSDT, and 85 cm−1 at the CCSDTQ level.
Our best estimate, Te=183±40 cm−1, is in excellent agreement with earlier calculations and

experiment, albeit with a smaller (and conservative) uncertainty. The dissociation energy
of BN(X 3Π) is De=105.74±0.16 kcal/mol and D0=103.57±0.16 kcal/mol.

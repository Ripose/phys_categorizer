Abstract

We calculate the open path phase in a two state model with a slowly (nearly
adiabatically) varying time-periodic Hamiltonian and trace its continuous de-
velopment during a period. We show that the topological (Berry) phase attains
π or 2π depending on whether there is or is not a degeneracy in the part of
the parameter space enclosed by the trajectory. Oscillations are found in the
phase. As adiabaticity is approached, these become both more frequent and
less pronounced and the phase jump becomes increasingly more steep. Integral
relations between the phase and the amplitude modulus (having the form of
Kramers-Kronig relations, but in the time domain) are used as an alternative
way to calculate open path phases. These relations attest to the observable
nature of the open path phase.

Introduction

In the last ﬁfteen years much attention has been given to phases in wave functions
and, in particular, to the topological (or Berry) phase, which is a signature of the
trajectory of the system ([1]-[6]) and which is manifest in some interference and other
π that is
experiments [7]. As noted in earlier works [1, 8, 9], the topological phase
picked up in a full revolution of the system is linked to the existence of a degeneracy
of states (or crossing of potential energy surfaces) somewhere in the parameter space.
This degeneracy need not be located in a region that is accessed to in the revolution;
however, its removal even by a minute amount will cause the topological phase to be
zero or an integral multiple of 2π. The physical model treated in this work conﬁrms
this eﬀect; indeed the calculated topological phase shows a change from π to 2π as

±

the degeneracy disappears (cf. Figs 1 and 2). We tackle the problem by tracing a
continuous variation in the non-cyclic, open path phase [4] (also named ”connection”
[2]), that is denoted in this work by γ(t) (t is time).

To obtain an expression for γ(t) we study (for both the degenerate and non-
degenerate alternatives) an explicitly solvable model. Both a detailed analysis and
the ﬁgures exhibit, as a novelty, oscillations in γ(t). These become increasingly more
frequent and of lesser magnitude as the adiabatic limit is approached. Furthermore
it is observed that in the adiabatic limit of the degenerate case, the change in the
open path phase is abrupt and results in a step function like behavior.

In an alternative approach to the calculation of the open-path phase we develop
reciprocal relations between phase and amplitude moduli of time dependent wave
functions (Section 2). Versions of these relations in other contexts were given earlier
([10]-[12]). The existence of these relations has the remarkable consequence that the
associated open path phase, deﬁned by them, is a ”physical observable” (and inter
alia gauge invariant) as a function of the path, a quality heretofore associated with
the closed path (Berry) phase.

2 Theory

We start by invoking the Cauchy’s integral formula which takes the form:

w(z) =

1
2πi I

w(ζ)
z
ζ

−

dζ

where w(z) is analytic in the region surrounded by the anti-clockwise closed path. In
what follows we choose the closed path to be the real axis t traversed in the reverse
and an inﬁnite semi circle in the lower
direction, of the inﬁnite interval
half of the complex plane, as will be discussed later. We shall concentrate on the
case that z is a real variable t and so equation (1) becomes:

where P stands for the principal value of the integral, ζ = τ exp iθ, dζ = iτ exp iθdθ
and it is assumed that τ
(the subscript SC in the second term stands for
semi-circle). Next it is assumed that w(z) along the semi-circle is zero namely

so that equation (2) becomes:

Assuming that the function w(z) is written as w(z) = w(t, y) = u(t, y) + iv(t, y)
where z = t + iy, it can be shown by separating the real and the imaginary parts,
that equation (4) yields the two equations:

u(t) =

These relations are of the Kramers-Kronig (KK) or dispersion equations type [13]
and they will be applied in the time domain. u and v are Hilbert transforms [14].
Our aim is to employ equations (5) to form a relation between the phase factor in
a wave function and its amplitude-modulus. If a wave-function amplitude ˜ψ(t) is
written in the form:

˜ψ(t) = ˜Γ(t) exp(iλ(t))

where Γ(t) and λ(t) are real functions of a real variable t, the function w(z) which
will be deﬁned as:

w(z) = ln( ˜ψ(z)) = ln(˜Γ(z)) + iλ(z)

is assumed to fulﬁll the necessary conditions to employ the KK equations. This
implies the following: (a) the function ˜ψ(z) is analytic and is free of zeroes in the
lower complex half plane (however, ˜ψ(z) can have simple zeros on the real axis, as
is made clear in several publications [10, 11, 14, 15]). (b) ˜ψ(z) becomes, along the
corresponding inﬁnite semi-circle, a constant (in fact this constant has to be equal
= 1 the analysis will be applied to ˜ψ(z) divided by this
to 1 but if the constant is
constant). Thus, identifying ln(˜Γ(t)) with u(t) and λ(t) with v(t) we get from the
second part in equation (5) the following expression:

λ(t) =

Next assuming that Γ(t′) is an even function, the equation for λ(t) can be written
as:

3 The Model

3.1 The Basic Equations

In this work, the reciprocal relations in equation (5) are used in the form shown
in equation (10) . A more general formulation of the reciprocal relations, includ-
ing several applications, will be presented in a separate publication. Equation (10)
is applied to two examples based on the Jahn-Teller model [16] which, following
Longuet-Higgins [17], can be expressed in terms of an extended version of the Math-
ieu equation, ([8, 18, 19]) namely:

H =

−

Eel

∂2
∂θ2 −

G1(q, φ) cos(2θ) + G2(q, φ) sin(2θ).

(11)

Here θ is an angular (periodic) electronic coordinate, φ is an angular nuclear periodic
coordinate which is constrained by some external agent, as in ([6], [20]), to change
linearly in time, namely φ = ωt (thus, if T is the time-period, then ω = 2π
T ), q is
a radial coordinate, Eel is a constant and Gi(q, φ); i = 1, 2 are two functions to be
deﬁned later.

The Schrodinger equation is (¯h = 1):

i

∂Ψ
∂t

= HΨ.

and this will be solved approximately to the ﬁrst order in qG
Eel , for the case that the
ground state is an electronic doublet. In a representation, adopted from [17], this
doublet is described in terms of the electronic functions cos θ and sinθ and therefore
ψ can be expressed as: ([6],[12])

Ψ = χ1(t) cos θ + χ2(t) sin θ

In what follows equation (12) will be solved for the initial conditions: χ1(t = 0) = 1
and χ2(t = 0) = 0. Replacing χ1(t) and χ2(t) by ψ+(t) and ψ−(t) deﬁned as:

ψ±(t) =

where ˜G is deﬁned as: ˜G = G1 + iG2, and the dot represents the time derivative.

Next we eliminate ψ− from equation (15) to obtain a single, second order equa-

tion for ψ+:

Writing ˜G =

arbitrary T will be discussed only brieﬂy and we will be mainly interested in the

adiabatic case where T is large, namely T

topological (Berry) phase β. In what follows we distinguish between two cases: (a)
The degenerate case for which the functions in equation (11) are given by:

≫ |

G1(q, φ) = Gq cos(φ),

G2(q, φ) = Gq sin(φ).

(21)

Where G is constant. We term it the degenerate case because the two lowest eigen-
values of equation (11) become equal in the (q, φ) plane at q = 0. It is also noticed
that: ˜G = Gq. (b) The non-degenerate case. This is characterized by the condition
that G1 = 0 and G2 = 0 cannot be simultaneously satisﬁed for real q and φ.It is
not trivial to achieve this by a simple change of the expressions in equation (21) ,
since, e.g., adding a constant will only displace the real root, as has been previously
discussed [19]. However, non-degeneracy can be attained upon replacing G2 by a
quadratic polynomial in q sin(φ), such that the polynomial has no real roots. A term
of this form is physically realizable in a low-symmetric molecular environment. (In a
realistic case of non crossing potential energy surfaces for NaFH, the expression con-
structed for G2 is very complicated [21]). Unfortunately, the equation (16) cannot
be solved analytically for a general polynomial G2. Below (in section 4) we present
an approximate solution for a case that a degeneracy is encountered neither at q = 0
nor at any other real q-value. This is achieved by the choice:

G1(q, φ) = Gq cos(φ),

and

G2(q, φ) =

(Gq)2 sin2(φ) + µ2

(22)

q

The quantity µ is related to the separation between the two potential energy surfaces.
If we expand the square root for small q, we indeed recover a quadratic polynomial
2 =
(Gq)2 + µ2. In what follows it is assumed for simplicity that the particle trajectory

The solution of this equation (as well as that of a similar equation for ψ−(t)) can be
written in terms of trigonometric functions. Returning to the original χ-functions
we get for χ1(t) the following explicit expression:

forms, together with ω, two characteristic periodicities of the system.

In Fig. 1 are shown several γ(t)-functions as calculated for three diﬀerent values
of G and T (= 2π
ω ). It is noticed that as T increases, namely as the adiabatic limit is
approached, γ(t) tends to a step function and β- the Berry phase- reaches the value
of π. This behavior is also derived analytically as follows.

Considering the case that T

(20) and (24) for the adiabatic case, that γ(t) takes the form (discarding second

In order to obtain the phase using equation (10) we have to construct from
χ1(t), which when analytically continued to the complex plane becomes χ1(z), a
new function that fulﬁlls the requirements imposed on ˜ψ(z). The complex function
χ1(z) is obtained by replacing in equation (24) , the variable t by z deﬁned as:

The ﬁrst requirement imposed on ˜ψ(z) is that it does not have zeros in the lower

no zeros for the ground state in the lower half plane. [Moreover, a detailed numerical

study showed that when the ratio of inverse periods ( k

ground state) are located in the upper half plane (including the real axis). For the
near adiabatic situation where ( k
ω = (a large) integer can
(on physical grounds) diﬀer only insigniﬁcantly from neighboring values of k
ω that are
non integral. We thus have two independent reasons for the assertion regarding the
location of zeros in the near adiabatic case. This is also conﬁrmed by our graphical
results in Figures 1 and 2, which clearly show the increasing validity of the integral
relations, as the adiabatic limit is approached, upon going from (a) to (c), and this
even though the ratio ( k
ω ) is not chosen to be an integer.] The second requirement
imposed on ˜ψ(z) is that it becomes equal to 1 along the inﬁnite semi-circle on the

presented γ(t) also as calculated from equation (32) . The results along the interval

found to be 2π below the values obtained by the direct method. We added to each
of the calculated values the physically unimportant magnitude 2π. The comparison
between the curves due to the two diﬀerent calculations reveals a reasonable ﬁt
which improves when either T or G become large enough, namely upon approaching
the adiabatic limit. Even the (Rabi) oscillations at the near adiabatic limit are well
reproduced by the present theory. Moreover the theory yields the correct geometrical
phase. It is also important to mention that when we are far from the adiabatic limit
the ﬁt is less satisfactory. However, we also found that for the choices of k which make
the function χ1(t) periodic, namely when ( k

5 Conclusions

The expression of the degeneracy and near-degeneracy dichotomy in the topological
phase is the main subject of this paper. The respective values of π and 2π after
one revolution (seen in Figures 1 and 2, respectively) obtained in a two-stage model
conﬁrm the expectations. However, on the way to this result we earned some new
results and insights. Oscillations near the half period stage were found (equation
(27) ) and explained. We also studied the tendency of this and of other features
in the ”connection” (namely the non-cyclic phase) with the approach to adiabatic
(slow) behavior.

An attempt has been made in this article to establish a link between the time
dependent phase (and its particular value, the topological phase, after a full rev-
olution) with the corresponding amplitude modulus. To establish this relation we
considered two alternative two-state models, exposed to an external ﬁeld, under
adiabatic and quasi-adiabatic conditions ([3], [19]). The two types of models are
physically diﬀerent: (a) one model contains an (ordinary Jahn-Teller type) degen-
eracy at a point in conﬁguration space; (b) the second is characterized by a nearly
(in fact, non-)degenerate situation (of the pseudo-Jahn-Teller type([16])) where the
two eigenvalues approach each other at some point in conﬁguration space but do
not touch. In Figs. 1 and 2 are presented time dependent phases and the (Berry)
topological phases for these two models calculated in two diﬀerent ways: once di-
rectly by employing equation (20) and once by using the KK relations which led to
equation (10) . Essentially these ﬁndings suggest that one may be able to obtain
the time dependence of the phase from a series of time-dependent measurements of
relative populations of a given state. We end by oﬀering the following interpretation
for our ﬁndings: The phase on the left-hand side of equations (8-10) is not a ”phys-
ical observable” in the conventional sense since no hermitian operator is associated
with it [10]. Yet, phases have been observed in interference and other experiments
[7]. In the present formulation, equations . (8-10) associate the observable phase of
the wave function with Γ(t) (the observable probability amplitude) through integral
expressions, in a similar way to that done in Ref. [11] for radiation ﬁelds.

Abstract

The calculation of Franck-Condon factors between diﬀerent one-dimensional Morse
potential eigenstates using a formula derived from the Wigner function is dis-
cussed. Our numerical calculations using a very simple program written in Math-
ematica is compared with other calculations. We show that our results have a
similar accuracy as the calculations performed with more sophisticated methods.
We discuss the extension of our method to include non-Condon eﬀects in the
calculation.

1 Introduction

The study of complex features of molecular vibrational spectra at high overtones and combi-
nations has become possible by recent advances in optical laser spectroscopy. Rovibrational
level structure of small polyatomic molecules has been elucidated in a formerly inaccessible
energy range. Transition intensities between these levels can reveal ﬁne aspects of the struc-
ture and dynamical properties of these systems. Theoretically, the evaluation of molecular
vibrational wave functions has relied upon a number of assumptions and approximations,
of which the use of a harmonic normal-mode basis is the best known procedure. At higher
energies, however, normal-mode vibrational assignments of individual states becomes more
diﬃcult due to anharmonic eﬀects. In this context, Morse potentials [1] have been proposed
to more accurately model molecular systems, as they often constitute good approximations
to diatomic molecular potentials derived ab initio [2]. Even if the general solutions to the
corresponding Schr¨odinger equation cannot be written in analytical form, the case of zero
angular momentum can be closely approximated by the one-dimensional analytical solutions
[3]. The analytic form of these wave functions has been used not only for the simple diatomic
case, but for the analysis of vibrational structure in polyatomic molecules, within a local-
mode framework (see eg.
[4, 5, 6, 7]). In addition, the connection of the one-dimensional
Morse, Poeschl-Teller and other exactly solvable potentials with the SU(2) group has been
exploited in the formulation of algebraic models which incorporate the anharmonic character
of the local vibrations from the outset (see [8] and references therein).
In recent studies, the Lie-algebraic approach has been also applied to the evaluation of
Franck-Condon intensities [9, 10] (FC) in small polyatomic molecules [5, 6, 7]. These studies
accurately reproduce the emission spectra of the S2O ˜C 1A′
π) experimental in-
tensities [6], requiring for their calculation a combination of two procedures: a) an accurate ﬁt
of the vibrational energy levels in both electronic states using a local-mode algebraic Hamil-
tonian, and b) an eﬃcient and accurate methodology for the evaluation of one-dimensional
Morse wave function overlaps. One possibility to calculate overlaps of Morse wave functions
is to use an approximation based on an energy-dependent harmonic approximation where the
widths and displacement of the harmonic potentials are adjusted in order to mimic the be-
havior of the Morse potentials at the corresponding energy levels [4]. Although this method
gives explicit formulas for the overlap integrals, and consequently a good accuracy for the
low lying vibrational states, it departs from the exact results at higher energies. Other (nu-
merical) methods, like the use of the Conﬁguration Localized States (CLS) formalism and
the use of Gaussian quadratures [11, 12] have been proposed as alternative ways to evaluate
the overlaps of two Morse functions.
In view of future applications to the evaluation of multidimensional Franck-Condon factors,
a simple and reliable method of calculation of one-dimensional Morse functions overlaps has
to be devised. In this paper we propose a new method of evaluation based on our recent work
on the Wigner function of the Morse potential eigenstates [13]. Our main result contains
analytical sums of simple one-dimensional integrals which are not tabulated and which must
be evaluated with standard numerical techniques. We make no approximations but must
rely on numerical evaluations for part of our calculations. Fortunately, present computa-
tional resources (like Mathematica) can handle these calculations with very high accuracy in

˜X 1A′ (π⋆

a simple and eﬃcient way. We show that a short program written in Mathematica (included
in an appendix) gives accurate results for several molecular examples. To demonstrate the
reliability of the method we compare our results with other calculations and provide esti-
mates for its range of applicability. In the last section we show that the procedure can be
extended, with no loss of accuracy, in order to include non-Condon eﬀects.

2 The Morse Potential Eigenstates

In what follows we brieﬂy review the properties of the Morse potential eigenstates and the
use of the corresponding Wigner function to evaluate their overlap. We then express our
result in terms of the integral Ia (eq. (22)), for which we ﬁnd a symmetry property and
a recurrence relation, which can be used to verify the accuracy of its numerical evaluation.
After discussing some particular analytic solutions, we apply our method to several examples
and compare our results with more soﬁsticated techniques [6, 11, 14].

The Morse potential is characterized by two parameters: its depth D (bonding energy), and
the inverse of its range β > 0 (restitution constant in the harmonic approximation). In the
one-dimensional version it is given by

Molecular Franck-Condon factors describe, in ﬁrst approximation, the dependence on the
vibrational wave functions of transition intensities between vibrational states in diﬀerent
electronic conﬁgurations. Assuming that the electronic wave functions are independent of
the vibrational states (Condon approximation [10]), the Franck-Condon factors are given by
the square of the overlap integral between initial and ﬁnal wave functions in the transition

In a higher approximation (Non-Condon), the electric dipole operator for transitions is ex-
pressed as a series expansion on the interatomic coordinates [17] or, equivalently, as a series
expansion in one of the Morse coordinates ξ1(x) or ξ2(x) 5. Our method can be adapted to
include such eﬀects in a straightforward manner (see discussion below).
A simple way to calculate the FC factors arises from the Wigner function of two Morse wave
functions, which we deﬁne in the form [13]

Overlap integrals of the type (22) were previously encountered in ref.[18], where it is stated
that they “cannot be evaluated exactly in general (for a
= 1)” and “it is necessary to resort
to a valid approximation”. In addition, it was stated that the alternating sums involved in
(20) may give unstable results as a consequence of the numerical error accumulation when
the sums are performed over very large numbers, a situation that can arise for realistic
calculations involving large values of j1 or j2.
As mentioned in the introduction, several approaches have been proposed to ﬁnd FC fac-
tors (20) in analytic form, including the use of diﬀerent versions of the harmonic oscillator
approximation of the Morse wave functions [4, 5, 6, 19, 20], the expansion of the integral
(22) into series containing polygamma functions [21], the use of a Laguerre quadrature [11],
and others. We now show that the integral (22), although not tabulated, is an analytical
well-behaved function which satisﬁes relations which can be used for its reliable evaluation
using a personal computer. In particular we have found that the program Mathematica can
be applied to calculate those integrals with high accuracy in an eﬃcient way.

We start our study by stating the following properties of the integral Ia :

1. Symmetry property:

Ia(k1, k2, y1, y2) =

I1/a(k2, k1, y2, y1) ,

which follows from (22) and the change of variables u′ = ua.

Regarding the application of the three-term recurrence relation (24), we observe that it
can be used to ﬁnd one such integral if the other two included in this relation are known.
It is therefore possible to ﬁnd a full set of integrals (22) with all possible values of k1 =
1, . . . N1, k2 = 1, . . . N2 if the integrals Ia(k1 = 1 . . . N1 + 1, k2 = 1, y1, y2) and Ia(k1 = 1, k2 =
1 . . . N2 + 1, y1, y2) are known for given a, y1, and y2. The relation (24) can be used in two
ways: to check the accuracy of the numerical integrations and to calculate the values of the
other integrals.

As example we use the recurrence relation (24) to check the accuracy of the integrations

Let us consider the integral Ia (Eq. 22) with (ℓ1 = 0, ℓ2 = 1) and compute it by numerical
integration and with the recurrence relation (24). For this we need to compute integrals
with (ℓ1 = 0, ℓ2 = 0) and (ℓ1 = 0, ℓ2 = 1). The absolute diﬀerence of both calculations is
10−67, being Ia ≈

Relations (23) and (24) led to a simple method to verify the accuracy of the numerical
integration. We are currently studying other properties of the function (22), which is a gen-
eralization of the Γ function, to which it reduces in the case a = 1.

In realistic cases, quite often the overlaps must be calculated for states with rather large val-
ues of the parameters j1 or j2 (or equivalently for large bonding energies, see Eq. (3). In this
cases the numerical integration of (22) requires a special treatment in order to achieve high
accuracy. Although the integrand is a well behaved function of x having a single maximum
and going to zero at x
, the resulting integral, being a very small number,
could be diﬃcult to evaluate due to the limited precision of the numerical calculations. One
way to deal with such complications is to perform a change of variables in order to scale the
integrand in such a way that the integrand at the maximum acquires a unit value at x = 1.
In all cases studied, we have found that the best procedure to evaluate (22) is by carrying out
a scaled integration. Our tests showed that the relative diﬀerences of the integrals calculated
using formula (22) and the symmetry relation (23) are very small (. 10−13) when the scaled

As our ﬁrst example we have calculated Franck-Condon factors for the S

10−14 between the
S2O molecule (Table 1). We found a maximal relative diﬀerence
scaled integrals (22) and the scaled integration using the symmetry relation (23). Despite
the fact that the numerical integration can be calculated with high accuracy, it is not always
enough to compensate for the loss of accuracy due to the alternating sums involved in (20).
This becomes more apparent in the cases in which we have a signiﬁcant number of terms
X = 7 and
in the summations. We can see this eﬀect in the results of Table 1 (e.g.
ν
C = 6). The use of logarithms to evaluate the products (and divisions) of the very large
numbers appearing in (20) is usually a good strategy to avoid some problems. However we
have also calculated the FC factors using this strategy and found no signiﬁcant improvement
in the results.

posed in [11, 12], and with the algebraic formulation using modiﬁed harmonic functions of

due to the above mentioned loss of accuracy in the sums.

The approach using modiﬁed harmonic functions is in this case expected to be a good ap-
proximation (at least for the overlaps between the lowest-lying states) since we have large
values of the parameters j1, j2 (large depths D1, D2) . However, there are signiﬁcant devia-
tions with respect to our results even for this extreme case.

two identical (but displaced) Morse potentials and (ii) the case of two diﬀerent Morse po-
tentials. We have taken these examples from ref.
[11]. Our results are identical to those
obtained in [11] where an analytical approximation for the Morse functions overlaps based
on the use an integration by quadratures was used 6 (see Tables (2) and (3)). Perhaps this
is not surprising since the corresponding values of j1, j2 are small. The accuracy of the nu-
merical calculations is high given that the eﬀects of the numerical instabilities coming from
the alternating sums are relatively small. The relevant point, as observed in [11], is that the
deviations in the results obtained from harmonic functions relative to those using the Morse
functions are larger when the depths D (and correspondingly the j values) are small.

As a next set of examples we have considered the vibrational transitions studied by Ley-Koo
and collaborators [14]. In ref. [14] Franck-Condon factors of diatomic molecules were calcu-
lated by means of 3-dimensional Morse functions via the method of conﬁnement in a box.
The solutions of the radial Schr¨odinger equation were found by diagonalization of the Hamil-
tonian in a large basis (N
600) of free-particle eigenfunctions with appropriate boundary
conditions. We have borrowed some tables from ref. [14] to facilitate the comparisons. Our
results for the Franck-Condon factors are in excellent agreement with those of Ley-Koo and
collaborators (see Tables 4, 5, 6, 7). This shows on the one hand that in spite of the fact
that we use 1-dimensional Morse functions, the contributions coming from the unphysical
< x < 0) are entirely negligible, and on the other, that our simple procedure
region (
achieves results with a similar accuracy as those arising from the numerically intensive and
sophisticated methods.
The speciﬁc transitions which are included for comparisons are:

[11] it was suggested to calculate the Franck-Condon matrix elements using the Laguerre
quadrature in order to avoid the calculation of the alternative sum in (20). However this approach may
present a similar disadvantage since the calculation involves a sum over all positive and negative nodes of a
polynomial.

Tables 4, 5, 6, 7 contain results of calculations arising from analyses of experimental data
[22, 23, 24, 25, 26], simple harmonic oscillator approximations [27, 28], anharmonic approx-
imations [20, 29], graphical integration [30], asymptotic expansions [31] and by the method
of conﬁnement of Morse potentials in a box [14]. We emphasize that we are concerned with
an accurate evaluation of the overlap of two Morse functions and thus comparisons have to
be done with similar calculations, in particular with the results obtained by Ley-Koo and
coauthors [14].

5 Non-Condon Eﬀects

Our method can be generalized to include non-Condon eﬀects by taking into account more
terms in the expansion of the electric dipole operator. Assuming a power expansion in terms
of one of the Morse coordinates, say ξ1 [32]

have a sum of integrals Ia(k1 + η, k2, y1, y2), each of them multiplied by the corresponding
coeﬃcient in the expansion (32). That means that we only have to calculate some more
integrals and multiply them by some coeﬃcients which should be chosen in a suitable way.

higher levels (large ν) being more important for the transitions (1
have not attempted to perform a detailed analysis of this transitions (since in any case a
full polyatomic treatment is necessary), it is clear that the present approach can be easily
adapted to include non-Condon eﬀects without major changes in the method.

6 Summary and Conclusions

In this paper we have calculated Franck-Condon factors by means of a simple formula (20)
(derived from the Wigner function) which can be adapted in a straightforward manner to
include non-Condon eﬀects when the transition operator is written as a series expansion in
powers of one of the Morse coordinates (33). The formula obtained involves well behaved
one-dimensional integrations (22) which are not tabulated, but for which a symmetry prop-
erty (23) and a three term recurrence relation (24) have been derived to check the accuracy
of their numerical evaluation. We found that the best strategy to treat the numerical inte-
grations is by means of a scaling method in which the integral is transformed in such a way
that the integrand acquires a unit value at the maximum shifted at x = 1. This approach
is particularly useful when the transitions involve large bonding energies (or large values of
the parameters j1, j2).

Since the present approach is oriented to possible applications to the calculation of multi-
dimensional Franck-Condon factors, we have conﬁned our study to the calculation of one-
dimensional Morse function overlaps by using a simple program written in Mathematica (see
appendix B for a listing of the Mathematica program used to calculate the FC factors).

ν2 ≈

As far as we only require transitions between the lowest-lying states in each Morse potential
(up to ν1 ≈
10) our results have a similar accuracy as those obtained through more
soﬁsticated methods. Although in this work we have included only a few examples, we were
able to reproduce all results in [14] with high precision. Only for cases involving long summa-
tions we observe some isolated small deviations. We emphasize that in the above transitions
we are dealing with rather large values of the bonding energies in the Morse potentials (i.e.
large summations in eq. (20)), which suggests that our procedure can be reliably applied to a
wide variety of physical examples. On the basis of these results, it is our impression that the
inaccuracies arising from the alternating sums in (20) have been overestimated. Such sums
can be calculated by Mathematica with no signiﬁcant loss of precision for a wide range of
problems of physical interest. However, for transitions involving higher-states a more elab-
orate programming of our formula is required in order to avoid the loss of accuracy. This is
beyond the objective of the present work and will be studied elsewhere.

In conclusion, Franck-Condon factors for the Morse potential and corrections including non-
Condon eﬀects can be calculated with high accuracy by means of a very simple program
suggesting that this approach is very convenient, since it can be implemented in any per-
sonal computer.

Table 2: Franck-Condon overlap integrals f1,2 between states in identical Morse potentials
displaced one with respect to the other. The Morse parameters are j1 = j2 = 5, β1 = β2 =
0.90 ˚A
, R1 = 2.67˚A and R2 = 3.60˚A. The ﬁrst line correspond to the results of formula
(20) using numerical integrations (22). Identical results are obtained with the exact formula
(26), and are also identical to the results of [11]. Second line corresponds to the calculations
using harmonic oscillator wave functions with oscillator length a0 = [(j + 1
2)1/2β]−1, and
third line shows the calculations with modiﬁed harmonic oscillator wave functions as given
in Ref.[4].

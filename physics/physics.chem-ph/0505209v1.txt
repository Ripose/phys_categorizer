reaction dynamics for the determination of
equilibrium standard states

Abstract

Chemical and other species reaction theories involving thermodynamical equi-
librium states characterized by a temperature parameter invariably utilize
statistical mechanical equilibrium density distributions. Here, a deﬁnition of
heat-work transformation termed thermo mechanical coherence is ﬁrst made,
and it is conjectured that most molecular bonds have the above heat-work
transformation property, which models a chemical bond as a ”‘centrifugal
heat engine”’ . Expressions are derived for the standard Gibbs free energy,
enthalpy, and entropy where the bond coordinates need not conform to a
non degenerate Boltzmann state, since bond breakdown and formation are
processes that have direction, whereas equilibrium distributions are derived
when the Hamiltonian is of ﬁxed form, which is not the case for chemical
reactions using localized Hamiltonians. The empirically determined Gibbs
free energy from a known molecular dynamics simulation of a dimer reaction
2A ⇋ A2, accords rather well with the theoretical estimate. A relation con-
necting the rate of reaction with the equilibrium constant and other kinetic
parameters is derived and could place the commonly observed linear relation-
ship between the logarithms of the rate constant and equilibrium constant on
a ﬁrmer theoretical footing. These relationships could include analogues of
the Hammett correlations used extensively in physical organic chemistry, as
well as others which are temperature dependent. One prediction of the prin-
ciples developed here is that the equilibrium standard reaction free energy is

more dependent on the height of the intermolecular potential than its depth,
so that the sign of the ∆G–0 can change for varying barrier height with ﬁxed
well depth, which may appear counter-intuitive. All the above developments
can be tested directly in simulations and therefore provides a fertile ground
for further research with signiﬁcant implications on how standard states are
determined in relation to the direction of chemical reaction.This work treats
the molecular bond using standard thermodynamics as if it were a system,
and it is anticipated that with the advent of single-molecule science and exper-
iment, that might be one way in which molecular statistical thermodynamics
would develop.

1 INTRODUCTION,DEFINITIONS AND MODEL

The Bohr correspondence principle can be used in the standard sense to de-
rive the quantum description from the mainly classical description given here
by appropriate mapping of the classical variables to operators and their inner
products (norms). The standard states used is described below. Normally,
the standard state is considered ”‘arbitrary”’ and set to unity and the ac-
tivity coeﬃcients are relative to this chosen concentration state c0 (e.g. unit
concentration or pressure, such as moles per litre, Bar or Atmosphere); two
primary concepts are implied in such an arrangement: (a) the assumption
that the chemical potential expression ∼ kT ln ci
(c0γ0) refers to setting to zero
the work of the intermolecular forces (perfect ﬂuid) relative to expansion from
the reference state where the activity coeﬃcient γi = 1 and where all γ’s are
dimensionless and only diﬀerences in work are detectable and (b) in other
regimes, the isothermal work done is ∼ kT ln c1γ1
(c2γ2) for the transition between
two states at concentrations c1 and c2 respectively. The c0γ0 term is absorbed
in the standard chemical potential µ–0
[1.0] . The absorp-
tion is interpreted as follows where the activity ai of a component is ai = ciγi
for systems where the standard state is at zero density, leading to an apparent
singularity. The chosen standard state (which we deﬁne and provide values
for) used here µ–0
i (T ) will be at inﬁnite dilution or zero concentration (ci → 0).

Further deﬁne (nµ–0

The above therefore is the form of the activity coeﬃcients γ used here. The
other important presupposition used here and also implicitly in the literature
that must be emphasized is that in writing down this form of the chemical
potential, only problems about thermodynamical equilibrium are solved. It
is an assumption to extend these forms to nonequilibrium regimes. From the
Gibbs criterion,it follows that the standard state of the chemical potential µ–0
for the potential µj = µ–0

j (T, c → 0) + ln γjcj6=i is such that

Deduction 1 Subject to the truth of Gibbs’ equilibrium criterion, the stan-
dard chemical potential of species i µ–0
is its free energy at zero density (
i
i.e. the free energy of a single particle entity coupled to a thermal well) and
the chemical potential µi(T, ci) at any other state may be written µi(T, ci) =
µ–0
i (T ) + kT ln ciγi .

Deduction 2 From (5), the standard state of any other composite species
relative to the base species may be computed as µ–0
An (T ),
taking into account the free energy change to that state.

An = nµ–0

A (T ) + δ–0

Deduction 3 Since the temperature parameter is speciﬁed, any species Ai has
single species thermodynamics i.e. that of interactions with a thermal reser-
voir at zero density,where the interactions are solely external forces between
the reservoir and the particle, and the equilibrium thermodynamical proper-
ties are the time average values for as long as the particle exists, and the only
exchange of energy between the molecule and the external universe is via the
heat reservoir.

4

Postulate 1 The Gibbs’ postulate that the ensemble average equals the time
average obtains, so that the species energetics are determined by the average
of its motion in the phase space of associated with it. Moreover, since these
are all single particle species that react or interact, they need not assume
Gaussian-type distributions for non-degenerate states for the energy terms as-
sociated with the reaction where there is an eﬀective change of the Hamiltonian
associated with the motions, as when a switching Hamiltonian is used.

Deﬁnition 1 A molecular species An (composed of n elementary A units) is
an entity whereby the intermolecular or internal forces can be unambiguously
distinguished from the external forces.

Deduction 4 From Deduction 3, if the single species is thermalized, the en-
ergy exchange with the reservoir can only be the result of the external forces
of the reservoir applied to the molecular species and vice-versa, and hence the
energy distribution of the system would conform to the average energies of the
various types of external composite motions (i.e. rotational and translational)
relative to the composite body An.

Deduction 5 Since the species is thermalized at any instant, the energy equa-
tions combine at all times the dynamics due to the internal and external forces,
and the stochastic average of any ”‘static”’ thermodynamical state variable is
the result of the application of Postulate (1). Reacting species exist for a ﬁnite
lifetime during which the internal and external forces are distinguishable.

From Deduction(5), it is possible to couple stochastic and dynamical laws
to determine the time evolution, e.g. conservation of angular momentum and
energy equipartition.

Postulate 2 Insofar as the single composite body (e.g. molecule, particle,
etc.) is an ’external body’ with respect to the thermostat, its thermal energy
modes ( e.g. rotational and translational motiion about the centre-of-mass
(CM)) are determined by the laws (quantum or classical) regulating these
motions.

Deﬁnition 2 A physical or chemical species species which conforms to the
above description for standard states, Deductions (1-5)and Postulates (1-2) is
thermomechanically coherent.

Figure 1: Diagrams depicting the rotational axes and ”‘bond”’ formation j due to
internal forces

a general scheme is depicted in Fig.(2.1) with the appropriate coordinates.
The simulation result reported here is when n = m = 1 for a simple dimer
reaction. This model is extended by considering product formation about
any bond j, depicted here along the z coordinate. IF masses An and Am were
permanently bonded along j, then the Hamiltonian for the system would
permanently feature the intermolecular potential energy (p.e.) between sub-
stances and the mean energy (for quantum systems) or equipartition of energy
results from the density P having form

P (p,q) = e−H(p,q)g(p,q)

(12)

where g represents the density in the total Hamiltonian space (p,q), which
is not the same as the internal coordinates of the molecules, where if the spa-
tial coordinates R ≡ q in the system subsumed that about the bond, then the
vibrational motion would exhibit the equipartition result, but for a reacting
system with bonds that break (approximating a switch of potentials) , the
phase density is a function of the total system density and such equipartition
results would not obtain. For instance, Fig.(2.1) shows the total internal en-
ergy Eint distribution of the dimer in our simulation,where Eint = 1
2 µ ˙r2+V (r)
where µ is the reduced mass, r the intermolecular distance, and V (r) is the in-
termolecular potential (approximated as a Harmonic potential, where the end
points which are curved in the actual potential was ignored). If there were no
bond-beaks, or if they were very rare, then one would expect a Boltzmann-like
distribution for the energy density, or the corresponding equilibrium densities
given by QM, but this is not the case here since a real reaction is occurring

6

where the internal coordinates are not the immediate phase space coordinates
of the entire system Hamiltonian H; for very small values of the rate constant,
the masses at either end of the bond j would be ”‘quasi-ergodic”’in that it
would cover a fair portion of the phase-space of the internal coordinates, lead-
ing to a density P given by the form (12) above.The internal energy is very
approximately micro canonical in one arm of the distribution, H(T ) = E for
the energy E and temperature T for the dimer studied here.This result should
be contrasted with the many theories that presume that the reacting coordi-
nate or internal coordinates have Gaussian or equilibrium energy distributions
e.g. [2, 3] or that the principle of local equilibrium obtains for these coordi-
nates in the sense that Gaussian or equilibrium averaging is performed [4].
In the Eyring transition state theory, the vibrational coordinate connected to
the ”‘bond”’ does not exist;the current mechanical description accords with
this insight. This result should be contrasted with advanced theories of bond-
ing which all presume a Boltzmann or standard quantum probability factor
of the form exp −H(p, q)/kT [2, 3, 5] for various subprocesses in kinetics. In
[2, p.3318], the Maxwell-Boltzmann density is used to derive the polarization
propagator in the binary collision approximation. The point here is that there
is no reason to suppose this is necessarily true, since the relaxation times of
other processes would determine whether or not such densities apply; for the
total internal energy (vibrational energy) of the bond, Boltzmann-type den-
sities might perhaps apply for relatively very slow reactions which have time
to cover the phase space concerned for the potential of that conﬁguration.
The situation appears even more precarious in Aroeste’s [3, p.67]development
where ”‘...we now further assume an equilibrium distribution in internal states
of the reactants...”’ where in the simulation result here, the total internal en-
ergy of the bond does not conform to these assumptions. In a recent review
[5, eq. (1),p.68] of standard Gibbs energy of association for large (protein)
molecular fragments with ligands of form

A + B ⇔ AB

(13)

(14)

which is of exactly the same form as our dimer reaction, the standard reaction
free energy is a complex function of Boltzmannized conﬁgurational integrals
of form

ZN,A =

exp[−βU (rA, rS)]drAdrS

Z

which includes the internal coordinates, where the complex ”‘contains six
degrees of freedom that represent the residual translational and rotational
motions of the bound ligand”’ with little vibrational coupling, since it is as-
sumed that ”‘the eﬀect of the ligand’s translational/rotational motions on
either species’ internal vibrational motions are very small. ”’. The standard
Gibbs’ free energy is then given by expressions of the form

where R is the gas constant, T the temperature, C 0 the standard concentra-
tion, the Z’s are the various conﬁgurational integrals for solute solvent and
dimer interactions, and P o h∆VABi is a pressure-work term. In the model pre-
sented here, there is continuous coupling of the ”‘external”’ modes with the
internal intermolecular forces. There seems to be a strong possibility of elabo-
rating the method presented here in rudimentary form to such systems where
further generalizations (and perhaps some corrections due to oversight at this
preliminary stage ) to what is given here would be required as more informa-
tion and experimental facts are discovered. The science of thermomechanics
and continuum mechanics [6] all use the standard heat and work terms of
thermodynamics , together with various dissipation principles to couple pro-
cesses and to describe the non-equilibrium properties. The use of tensors and
other mathematical tools are in a very advanced stage so that all kinds of
cross-eﬀects connected to the geometry of the system (and symmetry) and
coordinates of all the particles can be adequately accounted for. The work
here focuses instead on the concepts of a new heat term and its connection to
geometry, and doubtless the techniques currently available would be able to
cast the concepts here into even more compact form. For instance, Lexcellent
et. al [7] uses standard heat terms of equilibrium thermodynamical theory
coupled with other terms within a continuum; others concentrate on an amal-
gamation of basic linear thermodynamics description [8, p.210], where the
laws of elasticity are derived from the Gibbs potential [8, p.213,eqn.5]. Oth-
ers are able to couple motions [9, p.184]where the actual interior forces and
the motions and power dissipated can be described [9, p.179]but the diﬀerence
between mechanical energy and thermal energy in relation to geometry and
an external thermal source are not of immediate concern.

2.1 Description of dimer and coordinates

In the simplest case, the molecule can change ”‘shape”’, here deﬁned in terms
of the moments of inertia about the 3 principle axis, with the change de-
scribed by three orthogonal coordinates in the direction of the 3 Orthog-
onal axes used to describe the molecule rx,I , ry,I , rz,i,I, (i = 1....r) where
rI = [rx,I, ry,I , rz,i,I]. Obviously, one must choose the coordinates convenient
for the system of interest in the general case. As in Fig.(2), the ”‘bond”’
is along the z axis;
if there is free rotation about the axis, then about
bond j, i ≥ 2 for rz,i,I and the moments of inertia Ij are functions of such
changes of shape , i.e.
for the simple case where there is no cross-coupling
, we might write Ij = Ij(rj,i), (j = x, y, z; i for z coordinate only). These
moments of inertia pass through the CM of the product species, where if
Ii,j =
s msXi,sXj,s , then Ii,j = 0 (i 6= j) where i, j are the coordinates e.g.
Xx,s = xs, Xy,s = ys ...etc. Concerning thermal energy, for quantum theory,
the high temperature rotational partition function has the form [10, p.78]

for classical and quantum theories, there exists a function Ethermal =
i.e.
ET Y (T, I, rI, T H) where T Y refers to theory type (either classical or quan-
tum) and T H always refers to the type of thermal energy (vibrational, trans-
lational etc.); for translational energy about the CM, Etrans = kT
for each
2
orthogonal direction; the same results obtain quantum mechanically. For
classical rotation about the z-axis (free rotation) we would have an energy of
(kT )/2 per independent rotation axis, leading to kT for the z-axis, for the
free and independent rotation of the two reactant portions An and Am about
this axis. The situation is much more complicated for TY=quantum; for free
σint (IredT )1/2 , Ired =
rotation, the partition function is of the form ff ree = γ
where γ is a constant, and the partition function for internal rota-
tions with various activated states of angular rotation have the form fi.r. =
(cid:16)
∞
i=0 exp −(ωi − ω0)/(kT ) but the exact form of Matthieu’s equation is not
known for the solution of the Schrodinger equation for hindered rotations [10,
P
p.89],and so several semi-empirical methods involving constants like γ above
have been devised by Pitzer [11, 12] and others where the total partition
function for rotation ftot can be written ftot = ff reefi.r. yielding the thermal
energy from (16). The theory here is independent of TY; from the Bohr prin-

cipal, one can start from classical considerations and from there derive the
quantum expressions by applying the associated operators.

2.2 Determination of work-heat energy balance with molec-
ular distortion

For rotational motion, consider an element of thermal energy due to rotation
about the given (z) axis given by the form

ET Y = ET Y (T, Iz, T H = rotn, z)

(17)

Then distortions to the molecule by the change in Iz, in conjunction with
the application of the external thermal reservoir would cause a change of
the thermal energy by amount ET Y (T, Iz + δIz, T H). On the other hand,
prior to the application of the thermal reservoir interaction, the mechanical
change of energy of rotation (with conservation of angular momentum when
no external forces are acting on it) is EMech(Iz + δIz, TH = rotn, z). This
mechanical energy is derived directly from mechanics, (quantum or classical)
without statistical mechanics since the body is a purely mechanical object at
this interval of time. On the other hand, since the object must exist in a
temperature ﬁeld, and be in equilibrium with this thermal ﬁeld and thermal
reservoir, extra work of rotation δwTH=rotn,z must be provided externally to
the body to make it compatible with the thermal environment which would
have the rotational energy ET Y (T, Iz+δIz, T H). Here, Iz refers to the moment
of inertia about the z axis (i.e. the dimer is rotating in a plane perpendicular
to the z-axis) There is conservation of angular momentum during the dis-
tortion, and the tangential impulses are applied by the reservoir to increase
the kinetic energy (K.E.)to ET Y (T, Iz + δIz, T H).The analogy of this ma-
chine is the Carnot piston device, where if there is distortion of the cylinder,
the ET Y (T H = transl. and internal potential energy) thermal energy of the
working substance is altered, and so the piston would have to be altered in
position (by doing work) to maintain the same thermal energy density, where
the work is δwp = −P dV ; (here P is the pressure and V the volume)and
thus we are lead to the following deﬁnition by the above analogy:

Deﬁnition 3 An ideal centrifugal heat engine is deﬁned as one where the
work transfer increment δw is the diﬀerence in energy due to the loss of ro-
tational (mechanical ) energy, due to the change in shape or distortion deter-
mined by the coordinates Rz and the prevailing thermal energy in a temper-
ature ﬁeld at Rz + dRz, where there is conservation of angular momentum
during the distortion prior to the application of coupling moments orthogonal
to the axis to restore the rotational energy to that of the rotational thermal
energy at Rz + dRz.

Likewise, we can deﬁne a rectilinear heat engine thus:

10

Deﬁnition 4 An ideal rectilinear heat engine is one where losses in thermal
energy along an external boundary coordinate during the application of an
internal force by the system where there is total conservation of linear mo-
mentum can be compensated by the application of an external force in the
same direction, and where the work done by the external force is the diﬀer-
ence in energy due to the loss of thermal energy along the coordinate and the
prevailing thermal energy at that same temperature.

For rotational motion, the mechanical,non-thermal rotational energy (denoted
EM ech, Rot,z(I(Rz), Ω) would suﬀer loss δEM ech if δIz > 0 because of conser-
vation of angular momentum [13, sec.11.6.1,p.253] and the net work dW that
would have to be done to enable energy balance for an ideal centrifugal heat
engine is

dW z = (dET Y (T H = Rotn, z) − dEM ech,Rotn,z)

(18)

For instance, if only the z coordinates are involved then a simpliﬁed ex-

pression is

dWG,z =

∂ET Y (T H = Rotn, z)
∂Rz

· dRz

∂EM ech,Rotn,z(T H = Rotn, z)
∂Rz

(cid:18)
−

|T.E. · dRz

= −FI,z · dRz (19)

(cid:19)

where T.E denotes a pathway along that of thermal equilibrium, , FI, z is the
resultant internal force (due in part to the interaction with the thermal reser-
voir so it is not the pure inter particle force that the molecule would experience
in the absence of thermal interaction) acting along the coordinate Rz for the
simple example where cross-coupling of forces has been eliminated. Eqn. (19)
is a type of path diﬀerential, where the change ∂EM ech
is along a thermal
path that is consonant with equipartition of the thermal energy path at the
speciﬁed temperature, as provided by quantum statistical mechanics. For
simple systems, it can be shown by direct computation that the work transfer
(heat absorption) is at a maximum if (18) is utilized along each stage of the
path δRz. It is suggested that non-rotational motion interconversion such as
what obtains above for rotating systems is the essential method of transfer
for work-heat balances in normal thermodyanical systems, which leads us to
the following:

∂Rz

Conjecture 1 The rectilinear heat engine refers to the standard work-heat
transformation of a ﬂuid due to P − V (Pressure-Volume) changes, such as
is routinely discussed in thermodynamical treatises.

Theorem 1 The change of the Gibbs energy between two states ∆G due to
the transition between two coordinate points Rz, R′

Proof.There is an interconversion of energy between the external thermal
angular momentum K.E. and the internal energy along Rz brought about by
an external force so that there is no net heat transfer (pure work of Gibbs
energy conversion at constant temperature). Hence (19) yields a change of
the Gibbs energy between two states and the above results •

Hypothesis 1 The particle (including chemical) reactions found in nature
are to a good approximation thermo-mechanically coherent if the reactions
occur in an equilibrium temperature ﬁeld.

3 TEST OF HYPOTHESIS

In the following subsections , the model of a reaction is introduced, which
is applicable to all elementary second order reactions, and the general equa-
tions, derived as theorems are applied to the above hypothesis to determine
the standard energy states (standard Gibbs free energy, entropy and enthalpy
of the reaction). Estimates of the Gibbs energy is made based on the assumed
shape of the molecular shape distribution function deﬁned here; the determi-
nation of the function constitutes a challenging but solvable problem which
will be pursued in forthcoming investigations, and the current theory can be
veriﬁed from the said function. The estimates give results which are already
in good quantitative agreement with the Gibbs energy determined directly
from the equilibrium constant.

bles that of ref. [14] except that a harmonic potential is coupled to the prod-
ucts to form the bond of the dimer whenever the internuclear distance reaches
the critical value rf between two free atoms A and no virtual molecules are
formed by labeling or coloring the product. Hence the internal states of the
molecule can be probed, from which the standard states may be determined
according to the theory developed here. In the current study, the potentials
as given in Fig. 3 are used, but other conﬁgurations are possible.
In this
model, the dimer A2 is deﬁned to exist the moment it passes the threshold at
rf where the umol intermolecular potential is activated. The MD mechanism
for bond formation and breakup is as follows. The free atoms A interact with
all other particles (whether A or A2) via a Lennard-Jones spline potential and
this type of potential has been described in great detail elsewhere [15]. An
atom at a distance r to another particle possesses a mutual potential energy

The potentials for this system is illustrated in Fig. 3. Any two unbounded
atoms interact with the above uLJ potential up to distance rf with energy
ε = uLJ (rf ) when the potential is switched at the cross-over point to the
molecular potential given by

umol(r) = uvib(r)s(r) + uLJ [1 − s(r)]

(22)

for the interaction potential between the bonded particles constituting the
molecule where uvib(r) is the vibrational potential given by eq.(23) below

13

and the switching function s(r) has the form given by eq.(24). At regions
r < rsw, s(r) → 1 implying u(r) ∼ uvib(r), i.e. the internal force ﬁeld is es-
sentially harmonic for the molecule and at distances r < rsw, u(r) ∼ uLJ , so
that the particle approaches that of the free LJ type.Concerning the mech-
anism for the switching,in quantum mechanical kinetic descriptions, switch
mechanisms are frequently used for describing potential crossovers[16], but
from a classical viewpoint one can suggest that the inductive LJ forces due
to the particle potential ﬁeld (with particles having a state characterized by
state variables sLJ ) causes the internal variables at the critical distances and
energies mentioned above to switch to state sM when another force ﬁeld is
activated for the atoms of the dimer pair. State sM reverts again to state sLJ
at distances rb. The following values of potential parameters were used here
(Fig. 3):
u0 = −10, r0 = 1.0, k ∼ 2446 (exact value is determined by the other input
parameters),n = 100, rf = 0.85, rb = 1.20, and rsw = 1.11.

. The switching function becomes eﬀective when the distance between the
atoms approach the value rsw (see Fig. (3) A molecule is formed when two
colliding free particles have the potential energy u(rf ) whenever r = rf at
the value indicated above. This value can be deﬁned as the isolated 2-body
activation energy of the reaction. A molecule dissociates to two free atoms
when the internuclear distance exceeds rb (which in this case is 1.20). Thus,
the dimer A2 exists the moment it passes the threshold at rf when the umol
potential is activated, and the distribution of the dimer state is along the
segments a ≡ (0 ≤ r ≤ rf ) and b ≡ (rf ≤ r ≤ rb) leading to c = a ∪ b ≡ (0 ≤
r ≤ rb).

LJ reduced units are used throughout this work unless stated otherwise by
setting σ and ε to unity in the above potential description.The relationship
between normal laboratory units, that of the MD cell and the LJ units have
been extensively tabulated and discussed[15]and will not be repeated here .
For the system simulated here with the potentials depicted in Fig. (3), the
switching function is operative upto rb, the distance at which the molecule
ceases to exist, and where the atoms which were part of the molecule interact

14

with the potential uLJ like other free atoms;bonded atoms interact with other
particles , whether bonded or free with the uLJ potential. The point rf of
formation corresponds to the intersection of the harmonic uvib(r) and uLJ
curves , and their gradients are almost the same at this point; by the Third
dynamical law, momentum is always conserved during the crossover despite
ﬁnite changes in the gradient. Total energy is conserved since the curves
cross, and errors can only be due to the ﬁnite time step per cycle in the
Verlet leap frog algorithm, which would cause the atoms to be deﬁned as
molecules at distances r < rf .Similarly at the point of breakup, there is a
very small (∼ 10−4 LJ units of energy) energy diﬀerence between the LJ and
molecular potentials despite using the switching function in the vicinity of
the region to smoothen and unify the curves; the small energy diﬀerences
at the cross-over points are less than that due to the normal potential cut-
oﬀ at distance rc where the normal (unsplined) LJ potential is used in MD
simulations. A new algorithm which is general in scope was used to conserve
momentum and energy in this study and the thermostatting was at the ends
of the MD cell, as would be the case in most real physical systems. If Ep(r)
is the interparticle potential (energy) and Em(r) that for the molecule just
after the crossover, the algorithm promotes the particles to a molecule and
rescales the particle velocities of only the two atoms forming the bond from
vi to v′
i = (1 + α)vi + β such that energy and momentum
is conserved, yielding β = −α(m1v1+m2v2)
(for momentum conservation) and
energy conservation implies that α is determined from the quadratic equation
α2qa + 2qaα − ∆ = 0 with a = (v1 − v2)2 ,q = m1m2
2(m1+m2) and ∆ = (Ep −
Em) where empirically, success in real solutions for α for each instance of
molecular formation is 99.9 % and 100% for breakdown-where the ∆ value in
this instance is very small ( ∼ 1.0 × 10−4). This new algorithm coupled with
shorter time step ensured excellent thermostatting. The y and z directions of
the MD cell have length 1/16 each (cell units). This shape is chosen because
it is intended that future simulations will concentrate on imposing thermal
and ﬂux gradients along the x−axis,which would allow for more accurate
sampling of steady state properties about this axis. conversion units The
shape of the potentials and switching mechanism used here is surprisingly
similar to discussions of the charge neutralization reaction given in [16]

i (i = 1, 2) where v′

(m1+m2)

K+ + I− → K + I

(25)

except that these discussions do not explicitly mention the crossing over of
the KI and K+I− potentials at short distances (high energy), although there
is reason to suppose that such processes may well occur. It seems very feasible
that reactions that have an electro-magnetic force law component in the tran-
sition state may well exhibit some form of loop pathway such as the model
used here.

3.2 Energy distributions

Since this is an equilibrium system, Postulate (1) leads to the dimer existing
along a series of states about segment c above. Deﬁning rn = nδrm where
δrm is a ﬁxed grid interval, we may determine the probability function by
ensemble averaging at low particle densities (ρ∗ = 0.03 to 0.08) by binning
the number of occurrences Nrn at each of the intervals centered at rn = nδrm
so that

Pr(r = rn) =

Nrn
M
r=0 Nrn

(26)

P

where M = int(rb/δrm). In the limit, Pr(r) exists by Postulate(1). As the
dimer evolves about the r coordinate, work dw is done on the dimer until
the single molecule has a characteristic equilibrium temperature T ; all dimer
properties therefor, including the heat or work transfer characteristics must be
averaged by Pr(r): by the Gibbs’ postulate, the standard free energy ∆G–0 (T )
(determined at ρ∗ → 0), must also conform to the general deduction below
for ﬁxed temperature: δG = δH − T δS and since P = 0, δG = δU − δq.
The total heat absorbed by the reservoir −δq must be computed, as well
as the total energy over the entire trajectory; both of these quantities are
determinable from basic MD simulations.The thermodynamical path chosen
on the single-particle micro system can be a work or heat exchange pathway,
provided the same end-state is arrived at for both these paths since G is a
state function. We choose a work path in our example, rather than compute
the quantities above.The height of the potential curve at rf is 17.5153 and
this is a work term. From Deﬁnition (1) and Deduction (5), we can view
the particles and their aggregates as purely mechanical systems, thereby the
”‘bonds”’ and other internal dynamics, without invoking any approximations
whatsoever. the example of the dimer reaction assumes classical mechanics
(TY=classical). The computations were over a range of temperatures T ∗ = 4
to 20 so that mean values of ∆G can be determined over this range (where
T ∗ = kT ).The average value of Kc = [A2]
[A]2 ([X] is the number density of
species X) is determined for densities in the range (ρ∗ = 0.03 to 0.08) and
this average was taken as an estimate of Ke, the equilibrium constant since
γ, the activity coeﬃcient → 1; the ﬂuctuations are considerable within this
range and no discernible reduction in Kc value could be detected.At T ∗ = 8,
each mode would have from classical equipartition energy Tf , where Tf = 4
(energy per mode at rf . From these speciﬁcs, we can deduce that the thermo
mechanical coherent thermal energy- work exchange along a bond between
two internuclear distances is given by Theorem (2)below:

Theorem 2 The thermal energy-work exchange ∆W r2
distances r1 and r2 is given by

Proof. For each of the 2 rotational motions, Tf =
, where L, I and T
represents the angular momentum, moment of inertia and the total kinetic
energy, with the subscripts indicating the position. When there is distortion
of the r coordinate, then I varies, and the mechanical energy change in this
case is dEMech,Rot,z where

(28)

(29)

(30)

where Rz = r the intermolecular coordinates. Since Tf = Erot per mode,
and 2ITf = L2, leading to 2IErot = L2 so the increment of work dWG by
substituting in (28) is given by dWG = −I −1ErotdE and since ∆W r2
r1 =
r2
r1 dWG, the theorem follows •

Thus, there is a coupling of I and L because of the thermo-mechanical
R
coherence property. By Deduction(5), we can compare result (28)with the
thermalization requirement of Equipartition, where from 2ITf = L2 we have
2I4 = L2, and from (19) of the equilibrium thermal path with known tem-
perature T , we have

dWG = −4I −1dI

We note that Erot is the equipartition energy or energy per mode (either the
quantum or non-quantum energy, depending on which theory is considered
more suitable). Averaging leads to thermodynamical properties, such as the
one below.

Theorem 3 The total change of the free energy about the bond trajectory
∆Gmol is given by

Wrf =

∆W r2

rf P (r2)dr2 = ∆Gmol.

rf

r=0

Z

Proof. Since all dimer states are equally valid, the work done Wrf on the
single dimer (for all members of the ensemble involved in this motion) must
be (from (27) and (26) ) (per mode) the time average or ensemble average
value leading to the result above •

The above ∆Gmol is the increment of free energy associated with the bond
in its trajectory. In (30), for ant transition δG = δH − T δS for any transition,
so that if δq is the input of rotational energy caused by internal stresses,
then the internal work done is δW In, and δq is the heat absorbed where
δq = a and δH = δW + δq, then −T δS = −δq, so that δG = a + a − a =
a = δW . Alternatively, instead of expansion, we can compress the single-
molecular system, and (30) is derived if we note that if the bond axis about
z is compressed by doing work δw, so that the two other variations δ in the
moments of inertia about the x and y principle axis obeys δIx,y < 0, then the
increased kinetic energy of rotation would have to be removed by amount −δq
by the reservoir, where δH = −δq+δw and since −T δS = T δq, then δG = δw,

17

and integrating this leads to ∆W r2
δw that can be inserted into (30).
Finally some approximations may be derived.(Some exact expressions will be
R
presented later.
If the work done is approximately equal to the rotational
energy dissipation, then δU ≈ δw + δq = 0 or δq ≈ δw, or T δS ≈ −δw or by

At present, the form of P is not available, since the simulation program de-
veloped did not anticipate the need for this distribution, but it will be included
in future investigations for the years ahead, and would provide key evidence
for or against Hypothesis (1)and the current formulation. But estimates of
P (r2) can be made for extreme cases in the current study where the real value
should lie in-between the extremes; this is what is found; further, the extreme
cases yield at the least semiquantitative results, meaning that quantitative
results and corroboration of Hypothesis (1) is expected from a detailed study
It will be noticed that the total bond energy Etot

This motion would be moderated with the actual shape of the potential,
and the collisions caused by the heat bath in the radial direction; such dy-
namics leads to the curve in Fig.(2.1). It is conjectured that the rate of the
thermostatting might have an eﬀect on the shape of the curve, as it would lead
to the boundary conditions of (33) to be reset each time there is a collision.
The several scenarios which can occur are listed below:

(1) the molecule is formed at rf and then traverses to rb in such a way
that P (r2) = constant and P (r < rf ) = 0. The motion approximates
(33) except there is no accumulation of phase density at the turning
points of the curve, so all points have equal weight (consistent with a
transition stage with no multiple reﬂection back to the vicinity of rf
with Etot = c ). The array of conditions may be written

is carried over from the constituent reactant species and the work δWmthat

The results from the simulation for ∆S–0 , ∆H–0 and ∆G–0 follows. Here, we
can only discuss estimates for ∆G–0 based on the theory; the derivation for the
enthalpy and free energy of reaction will be presented but no detailed discus-
sion is useful at this stage until the P (r2) function is determined numerically
so that a comparison between the theoretical predictions and the numerical
values derived from simulation is made; this is a long term challenge. The

A plot of ln Kevs 1/T ∗ is given in Fig. (4) where the plot is rather linear over

yield a fairly constant average value applicable for the temperature range for
the standard enthalpy ∆H–0 . The overbar refers to these mean values over the
temperature range (T ∗ = 5 − 20). Since ∆G–0 is known, the average standard

The theoretically less correct method is to do a linear ﬁt to the equation
(assuming that both the standard entropy and enthalpy is reasonably constant

thermore, from estimate (32), we observe that ∆S–0
is close in value to the
l
range (0.500 – 0.6862) derived from (44-46).

Interpretation of results

3.5
The values (∆G–0 (1−3)) from (44-46) plotted against the experimental curve
given in Fig. (5) is essentially quantitative even for the approximations made
here. ∆G–0 (1) (Case (1)) represents a distribution of ”‘dimer states”’ uniformly
distributed, and is quantitative for 4 < T ∗ < 10 (lower temperatures).The
cases referred to in the superscripts have the following moments of inertia
ratios

Relative to the loop mechanism, for ﬁxed Irf , the results clearly show that
there exists an eﬀective value of the moment of inertia determined by P (r2)
designated Irbx where Irbx < Irb,1 (the arabic numerals refer to the Cases
(1-3) )for optimal results if the theory is correct, and that this moment of
inertia would change with temperature; there is a non-uniform distribution of
steady state distances with an accumulation of distance density at distances
r where r < rb; i.e. there is a preponderance of states to the left of the region
of dimer breakdown. Indeed, at high temperatures, the probability of states
x with internuclear distances rx → rf would increase in the vicinity δ about
rf for arbitrary δ so that Irbx < Irb,1 leading to the observations. However,
the overall changes are not very dramatic. In particular, once the eﬀective
Irf /Irbratio has been selected to coincide with an experimental point (Case
2 at T ∗ = 8.0) by adjustment of the parameter to ﬁt with the actual P (r2)

have also to derive from eqns.(50,51) the ∆H–0 and ∆S–0 terms formally for
this theory, which must follow from the internal dynamics of the molecule.

4 FREE ENERGY-LIKE RELATIONSHIPS IN KINETICS

This section includes a discussion of the Arrhenius rate law and its relation
to the equilibrium constant. If we admit that simple collision theory (SCT)
or the quantum version due to Eyring leads to Arrhenius type equations for
elementary reactions which determines the rate law then we can state the
following:

Theorem 6 There exists a relationship between the rate constant kr,i and the
equilibrium constant Ke given by

ln kr,i = B(T ) + ln Ke

where the B(T ) term has the form

B(T ) = ln

(cid:21)

Proof. Eqn.(61)says that

∆G–0 (T ) = ξmax + Wrf

′

On the other hand, SCT writes the rate ν as

ν = k(ǫr)n∗

1n∗

2 with k(ǫr) = σ(ǫr)vr.

The above expression refers to the rate for the internal kinetic energy ǫr =
µv2
2 .where the n′s are the densities of the reactants. Integration of k(ǫr) leads
r
to the form of the forward (1) rate constant given by kr,1(T ) [18, p.99] with
the rate expressions

where an Arrhenius form is observed in the last line of (67); σ is the
maximum impact parameter, ¯vrel(µ, T ) is the relative velocity of the particles
and ǫ∗ is by deﬁnition the threshold energy parameter, whereby all reacting
molecules must have this energy along the line of centers for reaction to occur.
The situation is not altered in Eyring’s TST, where ǫ∗ goes one step beyond
it, in that ǫ∗ represents the zero-point energy diﬀerence between reactants and
activated complex [18, p.103]. Hence, in this model too, ǫ∗ is the threshold
parameter. For TST theory, the form of the rate constant is

pleteness, we shall augment the forms kr,i(which does not alter the form of
the standard expressions, and which may be neglected in most studies not
concerned with the energies considered here) by a work term c due to the mu-
tual intermolecular forces acting on the reactants, which is a ”‘real”’ term
since these forces exist, and which has the form c = c(nA, nB, Ω) where
nA, nB are reactant densities, and Ω refers to the physical variables (non-
thermodynamical) such as the dielectric constant or the screening parameters
. We are focusing on an elementary bi-molecular reactions here as an ex-
ample. We can also apply a steric factor P so that the rate can be written

Taking logarithms on both sides of (72) leads to the result •.

Theorem(6) is cast in the standard language of the ”‘free energy relation-
ship”’ linearly relating for instance the logarithm of the rate constant with
the logarithm of the equilibrium constant [17, p.961, Sec 27.5] where it is
opined that the activation energy is linearly proportional to the standard free
energy change for a series of compounds, leading to correlation analysis used
in physical organic studies, fashioned after the Hammett and Taft equations
which are essentially an empirically constructed set of ﬁtting parameters [19,
esp. Chap 3]. There are two diﬀerent ways of approaching Theorem (6) and
(63):

26

(69)

(70)

(71)

(72)

1) From a physical point of view, of little interest to physical organic
kineticists, (63) may be viewed as an extention of linear Arrhenius plots,
where ln kr,i is plotted against 1/T ∗ to determine the activation energy where
A′
i(T ) is treated as a constant over the temperature range of the plot whose
slope yields the activation energy. In this sense, the linearity of the log-log
plots using (63) is dependent on the stability of the B(T ) function of (64) over
a large temperature range. Some comments are in order here; that ln A′
i(T ) is
experimentally rather invariant is a fact observed in many chemical kinetics
studies, where the Activation energies are determined routinely by plotting the
rate constant against the reciprocal temperature; in these estimates, ln A′
i(T )
is presumed invariant and accurate values are determined. For the cases
′ are linear functions of the temperature, so that division
considered here, Wrf
by the temperature factor would lead to a constant expression; actually it
would be weakly dependent on temperature due to the P (r2, T ) function,
which is expected to have a slight temperature dependence. Hence, for the
same reaction conducted at diﬀerent temperatures, we can predict, subjected
to the above assumptions, a somewhat linear relationship between ln kr,1(T )
and ln Ke. This prediction can be tested in simulations as well, for the general
applicability of (63).

2) At any one ﬁxed temperature, if the steric P and C ′(T ) function repre-
senting intermolecular work is reasonably constant, then for any two similar
reactants A and B, subject to the above conditions, we would expect some
forms of linear log-log relationships when the ”‘bond”’ structure is fairly sim-
similar activation energy and reaction pathway in the transition
ilar (e.g.
state). The correlations would be found if various forms of linear relations
′ for the same reaction with diﬀerent substituent groups.
are found for Wrf
In view of the fact that there is nothing unique that is speciﬁed by Theorem
(6) concerning linear relationships, a great many types of correlations may
′,
be expected by the expansion of other functions that can be related to Wrf
such as ξmax and the masses of the particles constituting the molecule, since
these aﬀect the moment of inertia I , and the translational motion. Such an
undertaking is a deep study in itself which will not be attempted here, suﬃce
to say that Theorem (6) can provide a foundation for this undertaking.

5 CONCLUSION

Particle reactions moderated or subjected to a temperature ﬁeld may be
treated as a three dimensional (3D) mechanical body which interchanges its
internal energy where these interchanges are due to the interaction of internal
forces within the molecule and the thermal reservoir due to change of shape
of the composite particle system or ”‘molecule”’. The analysis above allows
for the treatment of single-molecular thermodynamical systems. Advances in
technology very recently are gradually bringing about the realization of these
entities [20, 21]. It is possible to predict the standard states of such single-
molecular species by measuring its internal motion at equilibrium where the

27

P (r2) probability distribution function serves as the key in the derivations and
this probability function can be determined in principle from single-molecular
studies. The linear ”‘Free Energy”’ relationships are given a ﬁrm theoretical
basis because of the derived relationship between the equilibrium constant
and the rate constant for the elementary reaction. A deeper study would
derive relationships similar in form to that provided by Hammett and Taft.
It is predicted that the height rather than the depth of the potential well
would determine the sign of the standard enthalpy and free energy.All these
assertions can be tested, and future investigations would be directed toward
this end.

The deﬁnition of the activation energy is that for ˙r = vr = 0 = Ekin (where
Ekin = 1
r )ximax is the minimum energy required to form a ”‘bond”’. Dur-
ing the formation of the bond at the threshold rf , the values of the internal
kinetic energy has the range 0 < Ekin, +∞.We choose the time increment δti
to be small enough in the grid interval so that the following obtains:

|δr| = |ri+1 − ri| = β, where |δtivr| < β

For Ekin = α at rf when a molecule is formed, the work change δWα,i within
two adjacent grid sites is

δWα,i =

Wrf (ri+1) − Wrf (ri)

6= 0

at most by property (73); if the bond coordinate diﬀerence is < β,then δWα,i =
0. We can envisage the intermolecular coordinate ri hopping by one increment
(i.e. from i to i + i or i − 1).Deﬁne an interval δE in energy where Eα − δE

distribution, together with the internal forces of the bond (molecule) and the
mean relaxation time of interaction of the thermal reservoir and the molecule.

Abstract

In a recent paper [Phys. Rev. Lett. 93, 130401 (2004)], we proposed the idea of expanding

the space of variations in variational calculations of the energy by considering the approximate

wave function ψ to be a functional of functions χ : ψ = ψ[χ] rather than a function. The space of

variations is expanded because a search over the functions χ can in principle lead to the true wave

function. As the space of such variations is large, we proposed the constrained-search— variational

method whereby a constrained search is ﬁrst performed over all functions χ such that the wave

function functional ψ[χ] satisﬁes a physical constraint such as normalization or the Fermi-Coulomb

hole sum rule, or leads to the known value of an observable such as the diamagnetic susceptibility,

nuclear magnetic constant or Fermi contact term. A rigorous upper bound to the energy is then

obtained by application of the variational principle. A key attribute of the method is that the wave

function functional is accurate throughout space, in contrast to the standard variational method

for which the wave function is accurate only in those regions of space contributing principally

to the energy. In this paper we generalize the equations of the method to the determination of

arbitrary Hermitian single-particle operators as applied to two-electron atomic and ionic systems.

The description is general and applicable to both ground and excited states. A discussion on

excited states in conjunction with the theorem of Theophilou is provided. Here we construct

new analytical 3-parameter ground state wave function functionals for the negative ion of atomic

Hydrogen and the Helium atom through the constraint of normalization. We present the results

the accuracy of the wave function functionals throughout space. The same accuracy is exhibited

for the Coulomb holes when compared with the ‘exact’ ones determined by Slamet and Sahni. The

point of the improved spatial accuracy of these functionals is further made by comparisons with the

results of other wave functions that are not functionals such as those due to Hartree-Fock theory

and Caratzoulas-Knowles. We conclude by describing our current work on how the constrained-

INTRODUCTION

In recent work [1], we proposed the idea of expanding the space of variations in standard

variational calculations of the energy [2], thereby allowing for an improvement of the energy

in such calculations. Equivalently, a required level of accuracy could be achieved with

fewer variational parameters. In the traditional application of the variational principle, the

space of variations is limited by the choice of analytical form for the approximate wave

function. For example, if Gaussian or Slater-type orbitals or a linear combination of such

orbitals is employed in the energy functional, the variational space is limited by this choice

of functions. The proposed manner by which the space of variations can be expanded is

by considering the wave function ψ to be a functional of a set of functions χ : ψ = ψ[χ],

rather than a function. This permits a greater ﬂexibility for the wave function ψ[χ] because

the functions χ may be chosen such that ψ[χ] reproduces any well-behaved function.

In

principle, a search over such functions can lead to that function χ for which ψ[χ] is the true

wave function.

The space over which the search for the functions χ is to be performed, however, is

simply too large for practical purposes, and a subset of this space must be considered. We

deﬁne the subspace over which the search for the functions χ is to be performed by the

requirement that the wave function functional ψ[χ] satisfy a constraint. Typical constraints

on the functional ψ[χ] are those of normalization, the satisfaction of the Fermi-Coulomb

hole sum rule, the requirement that it lead to observables such as the electron density,

nuclear magnetic constant, diamagnetic susceptibility, Fermi contact term, or any other

physical property of interest. With the wave function functional ψ[χ] thus determined, a

rigorous upper bound to the energy is obtained by application of the variational principle.

In this way, not only is a particular property of interest or constarint obtained exactly, the

energy is also determined accurately since the variational principle ensures it is correct to

second order in the accuracy of the wave function. We refer to this method of determining

an approximate wave function as the constrained-search—variational method. The method

is general in that it is applicable to both ground and excited states.

An attribute of constructing a wave function functional ψ[χ] via the constrained-search—

3

variational method is that there is an improvement in the structure of the wave function

throughout all space. Thus, both single-particle expectations representative of diﬀerent

parts of space as well as two-particle expectations involving two diﬀerent points in space

are obtained accurately.

As in standard variational calculations, the satisfaction of constraints imposed on the

wave function functional, while ensuring the exactness of a speciﬁc property or properties,

will nonetheless lead to a less accurate upper bound to the energy provided the space

of variations remains ﬁxed. Any such decrease in the accuracy of the upper bound can,

however, be oﬀset by an increase in the space of variations.

The concept of the wave function ψ as a functional ψ[χ] is general in that the space of

variations may be expanded through the functions χ. The number of functions χ are also

independent of the electron number N. This contrasts with the Hartree-Fock theory [3]

Slater determinant Φ[φi] wave function which is also a functional but one of the N-electron

spin-orbitals φi. Furthermore, there is no variational-ﬂexibility of these spin-orbitals once

they have been determined self-consistently by solution [4] of the Hartree-Fock equations.

The space of variations cannot be expanded further, and therefore the Hartree-Fock theory

wave function functional cannot be adjusted via the spin-orbitals φi to be the true wave

function. Thus, this wave function functional constitutes a point in the variational space as

deﬁned for the functional ψ[χ]. The determinantal functional Φ[φi] is therefore not general

in the manner of the proposed ψ[χ].

In our original work [1] we had noted that the constrained-search—variational method

could be extended to the determination of arbitrary Hermitian single-particle opera-

tors.

In sect.2 we present the equations of this generalization as applied to the ground

state of the negative ion of atomic Hydrogen, the Helium atom, and its isoelectronic

sequence. The extension of these ideas to excited states in conjunction with the theorem

of Theophilou [5] is also described. We had also indicated various ways by which the

results presented in our prior work could be improved. One such mechanism was to

improve the prefactor in the correlated-determinantal wave function functional. In sect.3

we present the results of the application of the method with such an improved 3-parameter

Hydrogen and the Helium atom, with normalization as the constraint. We present the

results for all the expectation values are remarkably accurate when compared with the

1078-parameter wave function of Pekeris [6], thereby indicating the accuracy of the wave

function functionals throughout space. The same accuracy is exhibited in a diﬀerent way by

the comparison of the Coulomb holes with those of the essentially exact holes determined

by Slamet and Sahni[7]. The results for the energy and two particle expectations are

far superior to those of Hartree-Fock theory as expected. However, the single-particle

expectations are essentially equivalent since such expectations within Hartree-Fock theory

are correct to second order [8]. The comparison with Hartree-Fock theory demonstrates

how two square-integrable normalized antisymmetric wave functions can lead to essentially

the same electron density[9], but that one can be signiﬁcantly superior to the other. Our

results are also superior to those of the 3-parameter variational Caratzoulas-Knowles wave

function [10] that has a similar correlation term as ours but is not a functional.

In the

concluding section 4, we describe our current work on how the ideas of constructing wave

function functionals are being applied in conjunction with Quantal density functional

theory[11] to the many-electron atom.

II. CONSTRAINED- SEARCH–VARIATIONAL METHOD

In this section we present the generalization of the constrained-search—variational

method for constraints whereby typical observables such as the diamagnetic susceptibil-

ity, nuclear magnetic constant, Fermi contact term, and the constraint of normalization

are determined exactly. For the two-electron systems represented by the negative ion of

atomic Hydrogen, the Helium atom, and its isoelectronic sequence, these properties are rep-

resented by the expectations of the single-particle operators W = r2
2, W = 1/r1 + 1/r2,
W = δ(r1) + δ(r2), and W = 1. For these two-electron systems, the Hamiltonian in atomic

where r1, r2 are the coordinates of the two electrons, r12 is the distance between them, and

Z is the atomic number. We next choose the form of the wave function functional to be of

the general form

ψ[χ] = Φ(s, t, u)[1

f (χ; s, t, u)],

with Φ(s, t, u) a pre-factor and f (χ; s, t, u) a correlated correction term:

f (s, t, u) = e−qu(1 + qu)[1

χ(q; s, t, u)(1 + u/2)],

(1)

(2)

(3)

where s = r1 + r2, t = r1 −
variational parameter. Note that any two-electron wave function in a ground or excited

r2, u = r12, are the Hylleraas coordinates[12], and q is a

state maybe expressed in this form. The key to the wave function functional

is the

determination of the functions χ(q; s, t, u). The prefactor may be chosen to be of some

analytical form with variational parameters as in the present work, or the Hartree-Fock

theory wave function [4], or determined self-consistently within the framework of Quantal

Density Functional Theory [11].

For purposes of clarity, and thereby of subsequent analytical ease of solution, we assume

the prefactor to depend only on the variables s and t: Φ = Φ(s, t), and for the ground 11S

state to be of the analytical form [13]

Φ[α, β; s, t] = Ne−αscosh(βt) =

[e−Z1r1e−Z2r2 + e−Z1r2e−Z2r1],

(4)

where diﬀerent orbitals are allocated to electrons with up and down spins, α and β are

variational parameters, Z1 = (α

β), Z2 = (α + β), and N is the normalization constant

−

(See the Appendix).

(Note that the normalization of the prefactor is independent of

that of the wave function.) We further assume that χ is a function only of the variable

s: Ψ = Ψ[χ(q; s)]. (The space of variations could be expanded further by assuming the

function χ to depend additionally upon the variable t, or still further by a dependence on t

and u as well.)

The wave function functional Ψ[χ(q; s)] for the ground state then satisﬁes the electron-

electron cusp condition which in integral form is [14],

Ψ(r1, r2, ...rN ) = Ψ(r2, r2, r3, ..., rN )(1 + r12/2) + r12 ·

C(r2, r3, ..., rN ),

(5)

where C(r2, r3, ..., rN ) is an unknown vector. The wave function functional also satisﬁes the

electron-nucleus cusp condition which is [14],

ψ(r, r2, ...rN ) = ψ(0, r2, ...rN ).(1

In terms of the Hylleraas coordinates, the Hermitian single-particle operators noted

above and the normalization operator may be expressed as W (s, t) where, respectively,

W (s, t) = (s2 + t2)/2, W (s, t) = 4s

general, observables can be represented by single-particle operators expressed as W (s, t).

The next step is the constrained search over functions χ(q; s) for which the expectation

If the parameter α in Eq.(9) is ﬁxed, then there exist many

functions g(s) for which the expectation

can be obtained. This corresponds to a large

subspace of wave function functionals (See Ref. 1). On the other hand, if the parameter α

is variable, then the only way in which Eq.(9) can be satisﬁed is if

g(s) = 0,

(11)

This is equivalent to the constrained search of all wave function functionals over the

subspace in which Eq.(9) is satisﬁed.

Substitution of f (χ; s, t, u) into Eq.(11) leads to a quadratic equation for the function

a(q, s)χ(q; s)2 + 2b(q, s)χ(q; s) + c(q, s) = 0,

Thus, in order to ensure that the wave function functional ψ[χ] leads to the exact expecta-

tion value < W (s, t) >, one has to solve a quadratic equation for the determination of the

functions χ(q; s). The subspace thus corresponds to two points. The two solutions χ1(q; s)

and χ2(q; s) lead to two normalized wave functions ψ[χ1] and ψ[χ2] each of which in turn

give rise to the exact expectation < W (s, t) >.

For the two normalized wave function functionals as determined above, the energy func-

is then minimized with respect to the parameters α, β and q.

The above framework presented for the ground 11S state of the two electron system

is general and also applicable to excited states. For example, if one were to consider the

excited 23S triplet state of the Helium atom, one could employ for the prefactor in Eq.(2)

in this simplest of choices used for explanatory purposes, screening eﬀects are ignored.

With such a choice, the procedure to determine the wave function functional ψ[χ] is the

same as described above.

In addition, this procedure could be employed in conjunction

with the theorem of Theophilou [5] according to which if ϕ1, ϕ2, , ϕm,..., are orthonormal

trial functions for the m lowest eigenstates of the Hamiltonian H, having exact eigenvalues

to the sum of the ground and excited states is achieved. With the ground state energy

In this way, a rigorous upper bound

known, a rigorous upper bound to the excited state energy is then determined, while si-

multaneously a physical constraint or sum rule is satisﬁed or an observable obtained exactly.

The description of the constrained-search—variational method given in this section

concerns the determination of wave function functionals that obtain the expectation value

of arbitrary Hermitian single-particle operators exactly. The functions χ were assumed to

depend only on the Hylleraas coordinate s, and as a consequence, a quadratic equation had

to be solved for their determination. If the variational space is expanded, then one would

have to solve an integral equation for the function χ.

The ideas of the constrained-search—variational method may also be applied to sum

rules involving two-particle properties. For example, consider the pair-correlation density

9

g(rr′) which is the conditional density at r′ of all other electrons, given that one electron is
at r, and which accounts for electron correlations due to the Pauli exclusion principle and

Coulomb repulsion. The pair-correlation density for an N-electron system is deﬁned as

for each electron position r. However, in order to determine the wave function functional

ψ[χ] that satisﬁes this sum rule at each electron position, one must solve an integral

equation for χ. The details of the calculation of such a wave function functional are to be

presented elsewhere[15].

III. APPLICATION TO THE GROUND STATE OF THE HELIUM ATOM AND

THE NEGATIVE ION OF ATOMIC HYDROGEN

In this section we apply the constrained-search—variational method as described above

to the ground state of the Helium atom and the negative ion of atomic Hydrogen. The

constraint employed is that of normalization, and the prefactor is that of Eq. (4). We begin

with a discussion of the wave function functionals determined.

Wave function functionals

The 3-parameter wave function functionals are determined by solution of the quadratic

equation Eq.(12). This solution for the functions χ is analytical so that the wave function

functionals ψ[χ1] and ψ[χ2] too are analytical. We do not provide here the analytical

expressions for χ1(q, α, β; s) and χ2(q, α, β; s), but these functions are plotted in Fig.1.

Observe that the two solutions for both He and H − are distinctly diﬀerent: one is positive

and monotonically decreasing while the other is negative and monotonically increasing.

Thus, although the two wave functions have the same structural form, and both satisfy

the normalization constraint and the electron-electron cusp condition, they are very diﬀerent.

10

FIG. 1: The functions χ1(q, α, β; s) and χ2(q, α, β; s) for H − and He.

The results as determined by these two wave functions for the ground state energy,

and various single- and two-particle expectations are given in the subsections below.

Comparisons are made with the results of the prefactor, Hartree-Fock (HF) theory, the

3-parameter Caratzoulas-Knowles (CK), and 1078-parameter Pekeris wave functions.

11

Ground-state energy

In Table I, we quote the values for the ground-state energy for H − and He. The corre-

sponding satisfaction of the virial theorem, and percent errors when compared to the values

of Pekeris for He and those of the variational-perturbation results of Aashamar [16] for H −

are also given. Observe that the energies obtained by each wave function functional for H −

and He are an order of magnitude superior to that of the prefactor. For He, these results are

on the average 0.06% from the Pekeris values. They are also an order of magnitude superior

to both those of HF and CK. For H −, both wave function functionals lead to results within

0.1% of the Aashamar values, and to positive electron aﬃnities as must be the case since

the ion is stable. (In the HF approximation, one does not obtain the negative ion of atomic

Hydrogen to be stable. The exact satisfaction of the virial theorem by HF theory, however,

is a consequence of self-consistency.) The results clearly demonstrate that highly accurate

ground state energies can be obtained by constructing few-parameter wave functions that

are functionals. These energies are far superior to those determined by similar wave func-

tions with the same number of parameters but ones that are not functionals.

Single-particle expectations

wave function functionals.) The density ρ(r) is also required for the determination of the

Now the wave function functionals are in terms of the Hylleraas coordinates (s, t, u) which

involve the position of both the electrons or both their radial distances from the nucleus.
The electron density ρ(r), on the other hand, depends only on the coordinates of one of the

particles. Its determination from wave functions that are written in terms of the Hylleraas

wave function functionals are accurate throughout space including the deep interior and

far exterior of the atom. The comparison with the Caratzoulas-Knowles values (see Table

III) is interesting for its implications. The wave function functional values are an order of

magnitude superior. Of course, one does not expect the CK results to be accurate because

these single-particle expectations are correct only to ﬁrst order in the accuracy of the

wave function. Thus, our results once again demonstrate, that wave function functionals

determined by the constrained-search— variational method are superior to variationally

determined wave functions that are not functionals.

Structure of Coulomb holes

We next consider the structure of the Coulomb hole charge distribution ρc(rr′) as a
function of the electron position r. The deﬁnition of this nonlocal or dynamic charge whose

structure changes with electron position for nonuniform electron gas systems derives from
that of the pair-correlation density g(rr′) of Eq.(18) and from local eﬀective potential energy

theory [11]. The pair-density may be separated into its local and nonlocal components as

g(rr′) = ρ(r′) + ρxc(rr′),

where ρxc(rr′) is the Fermi-Coulomb hole charge. This dynamic charge distribution is the

change in the pair density relative to the density that occurs as a consequence of the Pauli ex-

clusion principle and Coulomb repulsion. It follows from Eq.(19) that its total charge is
1.
The deﬁnition of the Coulomb hole ρxc(rr′) derives in turn from that of the Fermi-Coulomb
ρxc(rr′) and Fermi ρx(rr′) holes, the latter being deﬁned through local eﬀective potential en-

−

ergy theory. In this theory, the interacting system as described by the Schr¨odinger equation

is replaced by one of noninteracting Fermions with the same density. The corresponding

wave function is a Slater determinant of single-particle spin orbitals, and one can then write
down the resulting pair-correlation density gs(rr′) of the model system as

gs(rr′) = ρ(r′) + ρx(rr′),

−

(30)

(31)

where ρx(rr′), the Fermi hole, is the nonlocal component of this pair density, and is a

consequence solely of the Pauli principle. The total charge of the Fermi hole is also

1. The

Coulomb hole is then deﬁned as the diﬀerence between the Fermi-Coulomb and Coulomb

holes:

ρc(rr′) = ρxc(rr′)

ρx(rr′),

−

and is thus representative solely of Coulomb correlations. The total charge of the Coulomb

hole is 0. For two-electron systems in local eﬀective potential theory [11], the Fermi hole is
then ρx(rr′) =

ρ(r′)/2 independent of electron position r.

−

In Figs. 2-4, we plot cross sections of the Coulomb hole ρc(rr′) for diﬀerent electron
positions r as obtained via the functional ψ[χ2] together with the ‘exact’ Coulomb hole

by the arrow.

determined by Slamet and Sahni[7]. (The electron, indicated by the arrow, is on the z axis

corresponding to θ = 00. The cross section through the Coulomb hole plotted corresponds to

θ′ = 00 with respect to the electron-nucleus direction. The graph for r′ < 0 corresponds to

the structure for θ′ = π and r′ > 0.) The electron positions are at r = 0, 0.566, 0.8, 1.0, 1.5,

and 5.0 (a.u.).

It is evident from these ﬁgures that the Coulomb holes as determined

from the functional ψ[χ2] closely approximate the exact results for electron positions

throughout space:

in the interior, within the atom, near its surface and outside the

atom, and in the far asymptotic region. Note the cusp representative of the electron-

electron cusp condition at the electron position which is indicated by an arrow in the ﬁgures.

Two-particle expectations

As a consequence of the accuracy of the dynamic Coulomb holes obtained, we expect

quote the values for the expectations of the operators u2, u, 1/u, 1/u2, where u =

the results for the expectation of two-particle operators to also be accurate. In Table IV we

compared to those of Pekeris are given in Table V. Once again, the results are an order

of magnitude superior to those of the prefactor, and are accurate for both functionals,

although those due to ψ[χ2] are consistently superior (see Table V). Of course, as expected,

the Hartree-Fock theory results are not accurate.

If one were able to write the expectation of arbitrary operators ˆO as functionals of

the density:

Hohenberg-Kohn theorem [17], then it is in the expectation of two-particle operators that

the small diﬀerences between the Hartree-Fock theory density and those of the two wave

function functionals would be exhibited.

IV. CONCLUDING REMARKS

The idea of expanding the space of variations in variational calculations by writing the

wave function as a functional of functions is appealing not only because the functionals lead

to more accurate upper bounds for the energy with fewer parameters, but also because, as

demonstrated in this work, they lead to wave functions that are accurate over all space.

Thus, both single- and two-particle expectations are also determined accurately. Certainly,

one could claim by comparison with the results of Hartree-Fock theory, but without rigorous

proof, that single-particle expectations obtained thereby are correct to second order in

the accuracy of the wave function.

It is also evident that the accuracy of two-particle

expectations lies somewhere between ﬁrst and second order.

In contrast, variationally

determined wave functions that are not functionals are accurate only in those regions of

space contributing to the energy. Thus, for such wave functions, it is the expectation value

of only those single- and two-particle operators that appear in the Hamiltonian that are

reasonably accurate. All other expectations are correct only to ﬁrst order.

21

The results of the present work could be further improved as follows: by expanding the

space of variations through the function χ; by employing other more eﬃcacious choices

for the analytical form of the correlation factor and thus of the wave function functional;

and by improving the prefactor.

In our work so far, we have employed analytical forms

for the prefactor.

( The results of our prefactor for the ground state energy of both

H − and He are superior to those of Hartree-Fock theory, see Table I.) Of course, one

could employ the Hartree-Fock theory Slater determinant as the prefactor. Or one could

employ a determinantal prefactor based on the orbitals generated within the local eﬀective

potential framework of Quantal density functional theory (Q-DFT). In principle, these

orbitals generate the true electron density via a model system of noninteracting Fermions.

The corresponding local potential within Q-DFT depends upon the wave functions of the

interacting and noninteracting systems. Therefore, the corresponding orbitals generated

are representative of electron correlations due to the Pauli exclusion principle, Coulomb

repulsion, and the correlation contributions to the kinetic energy.

Finally, we are presently investigating the use of wave function functionals in conjunction

with Q-DFT for the many-electron case of N > 2. In these calculations, the antisymmetric

determinantal correlated wave function functional employed is of the form

ψ[χ] = Φ

tional: f (χ; ri, rj) = e−β2r2[1
q is a variational parameter, and χ(R) is determined by the constraint of the Coulomb

−

hole sum rule for each electron position. This wave function functional satisﬁes the

electron-electron cusp condition.

In this instance an integral equation is solved [15] to

determine the function χ(R). Further, the products of the correlation functional are limited

to lowest order since higher order products of these factors are less signiﬁcant [18]. The

highest occupied eigenvalue of Q-DFT diﬀerential equation corresponds in principle to

the negative of the ionization potential[11]. The region that contributes principally to

this eigenvalue is the asymptotic classically forbidden region of the atom.

In Q-DFT,

22

the asymptotic structure of the eﬀective potential is due solely to Pauli correlations, and

can be determined exactly. This is because the contributions to the potential due to

Coulomb correlations and Correlation-Kinetic eﬀects decay more rapidly than (

1/r)[11],

−

so that the potential in this region arises only from the Fermi hole charge which is deﬁned

through the Slater determinant of the orbitals. Thus, accurate ionization potentials cab be

obtained via the use of correlated-determinantal wave function functionals in conjunction

with Q-DFT. These are variational-self—consistent calculations that lead to upper bounds

for the energy while simultaneously satisfying a nonlocal physical constraint. We are also

currently investigating the construction of wave function functionals of the form employed

in the present work, but with the satisfaction of constraints other than that of normalization.

We give the analytical expressions for the normalization constant, the energy, and various

single- and two-particle expectation values as determined by the prefactor wave function

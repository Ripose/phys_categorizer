The optimal power performance of a ﬁrst principle quan-
tum heat engine model shows friction-like phenomena when
the internal ﬂuid Hamiltonian does not commute with the
external control ﬁeld. The model is based on interacting two-
level-systems where the external magnetic ﬁeld serves as a
control variable.

I. INTRODUCTION

It is well established that the performance of work-
ing heat engines are limited by intrinsic unavoidable ir-
reversibilities. Maximum power is obtained at the ex-
pense of eﬃciency where the reversible point of maxi-
mum eﬃciency has zero power. This principle has been
clearly illustrated by the endoreversible model of Curzon
and Ahlborn [1] and summarized by Salamon et. al. [2].
Two additional unavoidable sources of loss are heat leaks
which practically eliminate the maximum eﬃciency adia-
batic operation, and internal friction which restricts fast
operating cycles.

Is this universal performance limitation of heat engines
macroscopic or microscopic? Though the common image
of heat engines is of large macroscopic devices, micro-
scopic models based on ﬁrst principle quantum mechanics
are limited by the Carnot eﬃciency [4], and show a re-
markable resemblance to their macroscopic analogs when
the engines produce ﬁnite power [3].

In previous studies, both discrete [5–9] and continuous
quantum models [3,10–12] have been scrutinized, which
are analogous, respectively, to four-stroke-engines and
turbines. The present study examines a discrete four-
stroke quantum engine, comparing it to an engine subject
to phenomenological internal friction. It will be demon-
strated that the quantum engines inability to control si-
multaneously the external and internal portions of the
working ﬂuid Hamiltonian is its source of friction.

II. BASIC CONSTRUCTION

All working heat engines and all refrigerators operate
on the same principle. The engine manipulates the en-
ergy ﬂow between three reservoirs, a hot, cold and power
reservoir, either to extract power from the temperature
diﬀerence or to pump heat from the cold to the hot reser-
voir at the expense of external power.

The present model of a discrete quantum heat engine
is composed of a cycle of operation constructed from two
adiabats and two isotherms similar to a Otto cycle. The

quantum dynamics are generated by external ﬁelds in the
adiabats and by heat ﬂows from hot and cold reservoirs
in the isochores. The working medium is modeled as a
gas of interacting particles with the Hamiltonian:

ˆH = ˆHext + ˆHint .

(1)
ˆHi is the sum of single particle Hamilto-
ˆHext = ω
nians, ω = ω(t) is the time dependent external control
ﬁeld, and ˆHint represents the inter-particle interaction.
The change in time of an operator ˆA during the adia-

Pi

batic/isochoreal branches is described as:

˙ˆA = i[ ˆH, ˆA] +

∂ ˆA
∂t
LD represents the Liouville dissipative generator on the
isochore in contact with either the hot or cold bath (units
of ~ = 1). Replacing ˆA by ˆH in Eq. (2) leads to the
power invested in or extracted from the adiabats:,

For simplicity, the single particle Hamiltonian is chosen
as a two-level-system (TLS): ˆHi = ˆσi
z. The interaction
term is restricted to coupling of pairs of spin atoms. As a
result, the state of the working medium is described by an
ensemble of pairs of two-level-systems represented by the
density operator ˆρ, deﬁned in the tensor product space
of the individual two TLS systems. Expectation values
are obtained by the usual deﬁnition

the model approaches the previously studied friction-

gle particle spins in the ~x and ~y direction. As a result,

larized in the ~z direction.

III. DYNAMICS OF THE WORKING MEDIUM

The dynamics generated by the Hamiltonian is com-
pletely determined by the algebra of commutation rela-
tions of the set of 16 operators spanning the Hilbert space
of the combined system. Due to symmetry, the commu-
tation algebra decomposes into subsets of operators with
closed commutation relations. The set is generated by
commutation relations between the operators composing
the Hamiltonian:

The commutation relation: [ ˆB1, ˆB2] = 4i ˆB3 leads to the
deﬁnition of ˆB3 which closes the set i.e. the set of oper-
ators ˆB1, ˆB2, ˆB3 forms a closed subset of the Lie algebra
of the combined system. The Hamiltonian expressed in
terms of the set of operators becomes: ˆH = ω ˆB1 + J ˆB2

This similarity can be exploited to express the expecta-
tion values in a Cartesian three dimensional space, where
the external ﬁeld is in the B1 or ~z direction, the correla-
tions in the B2 or ~x direction and B3 is in the ~y direction.
The closed set of operators ˆBi is suﬃcient to follow the
changes in energy and to obtain the power consumption.
Using Eq. (2) and the commutation relations of the set
of ˆBi operators, the Heisenberg equation of motion for
this set becomes:

Point E is the equilibrium point of the scaled energy E/Ω
at the bath temperature Th with external ﬁeld strength
ωb. Adiabatic compression from ωb to ωa follows the tra-
jectory from point B to point C for a time duration τba
with a constant ˙ω. The system is in contact with the
cold bath from point C to point D for a time duration
τc. The cold bath equilibrium point, at temperature Tc
at ωa, is F. The cycle becomes closed by a compression
stage from point D back to point A.

IV. THE CYCLE OF OPERATION

Fig. 1 illustrates the cycle of operation on the plane of
the variables ω, the external control, and the projection
of the polarization on the energy axis E/Ω. A diﬀerent
view is displayed in Fig. 2 showing the cycle trajectory

dinates

FIG. 2. The optimal power heat engine cycle corresponding
to Fig. 1. The ˆB1 coordinate represents the individual parti-
cle polarization, and the ˆB2 and ˆB3 coordinates represent the
interparticle correlation. The inner cycle with blue isochores
is subject to strong dephasing (γh = 0.15 and γc = 0.5).

For long time duration on the adiabats the cycle of op-
eration is restricted to the ˆB1, ˆB2 plane. For fast motion
on the adiabats the system cannot follow the instanta-
neous change in the direction of the Hamiltonian rotat-
ing on the ˆB1, ˆB2 plane. As a result the expectation of
the ˆB3 operator increases starting a precession type mo-
tion around the temporary direction of the Hamiltonian
ˆH = ω(t) ˆB1 + J ˆB2. This can be seen clearly in Fig. 2 in
the trajectory from point D to point A. The precession
motion continues on the isochore where the Hamiltonian
becomes constant (point A to point B). In addition, due
to dephasing, the amplitude of the precession motion is
damped. Part of the dephasing is caused by the energy
equilibration with the bath. When pure dephasing is
added the precession motion is damped almost instantly
(Cf. ﬁg 2). The motion out of the ˆB1, ˆB2 plane causes
a bending upward in the adiabats as seen in Fig. 1. This
bending causes additional work on the adiabats which is
then dissipated on the isochores. This causes a reduction
in eﬃciency from ηmax = 1
Ωa/Ωb = 0.5581 which is
−
reached at inﬁnite cycle times to a lower value at maxi-
mum power ηP max = 0.495 (ηcarnot = 0.8). The cycle of
the engine is completely determined by the external con-
trol parameters ωa, ωb, Th, Tc, and the time allocations:
τh, τc, τba, τab. Independent of the initial condition, the
engine settles to a limit cycle after a few revolutions with
the preset sequence of isochores and adiabats.

FIG. 1. The heat engine with J 6= 0 in the ω , E/Ω plane.
Th is the hot bath temperature. τh is the time allocation when
in contact with the hot bath. Tc and τc represent the temper-
ature and time allocation for the cold bath. τba represents the
time allocation for compression (ﬁeld change from ωb to ωa)
and τab for expansion. The rectangular box which includes
point E on the hot isochore where the system is in equilib-
rium with Th, and point F (equilibrium with Tc ) on the cold
isochore, represents the cycle of maximum work. This cycle
spends an inﬁnite amount of time on all branches. The work
is the area of the rectangle Wmax = (Ωb −Ωa)·(
). The
optimal power cycle is emphasized by the green shading. The
time allocations for this cycle are τh = 1.705,τba = 0.4369
,τc = 1.76597321 and τab = 0.4953. The cycle depicted in
purple is characterized by very short time allocations on the
adiabats (τba = τab = 0.00025). The common engine parame-
ters are: ωa = 1.794, ωb = 4.239 Th = 2.5, Tc = 0.5, J = 0.6.

The optimization analysis starts by setting the external
parameters as the extreme ﬁeld values ωb, ωa and the hot
and cold bath temperatures at Th, Tc. The performance
of the engine therefore will be determined by the time
allocated to the diﬀerent segments. By setting the total
cycle time τ = τba + τc + τab + τh the optimization is
carried out by partitioning the time between the adiabats
and isochores. This splits the allocated time between the
hot and cold bath isochores, and splits the allocated time
between the compression and expansion adiabats.

In the limiting case of no internal coupling J = 0, the
current model is identical to the noted frictionless one
[7,9]. In this frictionless case the optimal power time al-
location on the isochores becomes: Γhτh = Γcτc and zero
time allocation on the adiabats. For J
= 0 the time allo-
cations changes considerably. Two limiting cases emerge,
the slow limit where most of the cycle time is allocated
to the adiabats, and the fast or sudden limit where most
of the time is allocated to the isochores.

Due to the precession motion, the cycle operation is
noisy. A small change in a parameter can considerably
alter the limit cycle and thus the performance of the en-
gine. Additional pure dephasing damps the noise of the
engine (Cf. Fig. 2) while the overall performance is only
slightly altered.

The global power optimum was sought by both a con-
jugate gradient method and by a random search scruti-
nizing local maxima. The optimal power as a function
of the total cycle time is shown in Fig. 3 for diﬀerent J
values. It is clear that the power has a clear maximum
with respect to the cycle period τ . The optimal value de-
creases and cycle time increases with increasing J. The
maximum power output as a function of J is shown in
the insert together with the analogous friction case.

Despite the large local ﬂuctuations with respect to time
allocations the optimal power performance of the quan-
tum engine shows a remarkable overall similarity to the
performance of an engine subject to phenomenological
friction as studied in Ref. [9]. One expects friction to op-
pose the fast motion on the adiabats, therefore the extra
power invested has to be independent of the sign of the
change in the control ﬁeld. This means that to the lowest
order it has to be proportional to the square of the time
Pf ric = σ2 ˙ω2. The accumulated extra
derivative i.e.
work is then dissipated on the cold isochore. The engine
subject to friction shows performance curves and opti-
mal time allocations which are very close to the present
ﬁrst principle quantum model. For this case the origin of
lost power is the inability of the ”polarization” vector to

follow adiabatically the instantaneous Hamiltonian. The
resulting precession motion on the isochores then leads to
additional dissipation on the cold isochore. To the lowest
order, the additional power should scale as J 2 which ex-
plains the observed linear relation of J with the friction
parameter σ.

To conclude, we have found that a quantum heat en-
gine with a working ﬂuid which is not completely con-
trollable by the external ﬁeld shows performance charac-
teristics which can be mapped into a heat engine subject
to phenomenological friction.

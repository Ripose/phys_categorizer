Abstract

The generalized relativistic eﬀective core potential (GRECP) approach is
employed in the framework of multireference single- and double-excitation
conﬁguration interaction (MRD-CI) method to calculate the spin-orbit (SO)
splitting in the 2P o ground state of the Tl atom and spectroscopic constants
for the 0+ ground state of TlH. The 21-electron GRECP for Tl is used and
the outer core 5s and 5p pseudospinors are frozen with the help of the level
shift technique. The spin-orbit selection scheme with respect to relativistic
multireference states and the corresponding code are developed and applied in
the calculations. In this procedure both correlation and spin-orbit interactions
are taken into account. A [4,4,4,3,2] basis set is optimized for the Tl atom
and employed in the TlH calculations. Very good agreement is found for the
equilibrium distance, vibrational frequency, and dissociation energy of the TlH
ground state (Re = 1.870 ˚A, ωe = 1420 cm−1, De = 2.049 eV) as compared
with the experimental data (Re = 1.868 ˚A, ωe = 1391 cm−1, De = 2.06 eV).

I. INTRODUCTION

1/2 − 2P o

During the last few years a large number of publications have dealt with calculations of
the 2P o
3/2 splitting in the ground state of the Tl atom and spectroscopic constants for
the 0+ ground state of TlH. Such interest to these systems arises because of their relatively
simple electronic structure in the valence region. This makes them very convenient objects
for testing methods for the description of relativistic and correlation eﬀects. We can mention
some recent papers [1–7] in which the electronic structure of thallium was studied and papers
[8–11] in which the calculation of spectroscopic constants for TlH was carried out. With the
exception of the atomic RCC calculation by Eliav et al. [6,7] and the atomic CI/MBPT2
calculation by Dzuba et al. [2], the published results cannot be considered to be very accurate
and reliable, however, primarily because of the rather small basis sets and the small numbers
of correlated electrons.

In calculations of Tl and TlH with the use of the relativistic eﬀective core potential
(RECP) approximation [12], in which only 13 thallium electrons are treated explicitly (13e-
RECPs), one more problem appears. The correlation of the outer core (OC) and valence
(V) electrons, occupying the 5d and ns, np, nd (n = 6, 7, . . .) orbitals, respectively, cannot
be satisfactorily described, mainly because the smoothed V-pseudoorbitals (pseudospinors)
have the wrong behaviour in the OC region. One-electron functions φcorr
x,k (r), being some
linear combinations of virtual orbitals, correlate to occupied orbitals φocc
(where x = c, v
x
stands for the OC and V orbital indices) and are usually localized in the same space region
as φocc
x . Therefore, the original “direct” Coulomb two-electron integrals describing the OC-V
correlation of φocc
can be well reproduced by those with the pseudoorbitals, despite
their localization in diﬀerent space regions. However, a two-electron integral describing the
“exchange” part of the OC-V correlation,

cannot be well reproduced because the V-pseudoorbitals are smoothed in the OC region
where the OC-pseudoorbitals are localized (for more theoretical details, see Ref. [13]).

The ﬁrst RECPs for Tl with the 5s, 5p shells treated explicitly (21e-RECPs) for which this
disadvantage of the earlier “semicore” RECPs was overcome were generated and tested in
single-conﬁgurational calculations by Mosyagin et al. [14,15]. Some other inherent problems
of the “nodeless” RECPs were also solved with the 21-electron Generalized RECP (21e-
GRECP) version presented in Ref. [14,15]. In Ref. [15], for the case of the 21e-GRECP it
was also shown that the 5s, 5p pseudospinors could be frozen while still providing signiﬁcantly
higher accuracy than 13e-RECPs because the valence and virtual ns and np (n = 6, 7, . . .)
pseudoorbitals in the former case already have the proper nodal structure in the OC region.

II. THE GRECP OPERATOR IN THE SPIN-ORBIT REPRESENTATION

In most existing quantum-chemical codes for molecular calculations with RECPs (as well
as in the MRD-CI code used in the present work) spin-orbit basis sets are used. In these
versions the number of the two-electron integrals is substantially smaller than in the case

2

of spinor basis sets providing the same level of correlation treatment. Spin-orbit basis sets
are preferable in the calculations in which correlation eﬀects give a higher contribution to
the properties of interest than those of a relativistic nature. This is usually the case for
valence and outermost core electrons, which mainly determine chemical and spectroscopic
properties of molecules.

Together with the spin-orbit basis set, the GRECP for Tl should also be employed in
the spin-orbit representation. Following Ref. [16,17], the components of the spin-averaged
part of the GRECP operator called the averaged relativistic eﬀective potentials (AREP) are
written in the form [13,14]:

where Unl±(r) are the potentials generated for the ˜ϕnl±(r) pseudospinors by means of the
Goddard scheme [18]; nx is the principal quantum number of an outercore (nc), valence (nv)
or virtual (na) pseudospinor; l and j are angular and total electron momenta; ± stands for

(5)

j = l ± 1/2; ePncl±(r) is the radial projector on the OC pseudospinors:

ePncl±(r) = Xm g|nc, l, ±, mi ghnc, l, ±, m| .

Clearly, the AREP component of the GRECP may be used in calculations with nonrela-
tivistic quantum-chemical codes in order to take account of spin-independent relativistic
eﬀects.

The operator of the eﬀective spin-orbit interaction can be derived following the expression

for the spin-angular projector Pl± from Ref. [17]:

Pl±(Ω, σ) =

2(cid:17)Pl(Ω) ± 2Pl(Ω)~l~sPl(Ω)i .

(6)

Its components, called the eﬀective spin-orbit potentials (ESOP), can be written as [13,14]

∆Unvl(r) = Unvl+(r) − Unvl−(r),

∆Uncl(r) = Vncnvl+(r) − Vncnvl−(r),

where |lmihlm| is the projector on the spherical function Ylm.

Neglecting the diﬀerence between U AREP

nvL

and Unv LJ for virtual pseudospinors with l > L

(for theoretical details see Ref. [13]), one can write the GRECP operator U as

U = U AREP

(11)

Note that the nonlocal terms with the projectors on the most important correlation
functions ˜ϕcorr
nxl±;nklk ±(r) (1) (where x = c, v) localized mainly in the OC and V regions and
with the corresponding potentials U corr
nklk±(r) can be taken into account in the considered ex-
pressions for the GRECP operator additionally to those with the OC projectors. Obviously,
the non-local GRECP terms for the frozen OC pseudospinors can be omitted in the sum on
(ncl) in Eq. (11).

We should emphasize that in spite of the rather complicated form of the above GRECP
operator, the main computational eﬀort in calculating matrix elements with the GRECP is
caused by the standard radially-local operator, which is also a part of conventional RECP
operators, and not by the non-local GRECP terms. Thus, the additional complications in
calculations with GRECPs are negligible in comparison with treatments employing conven-
tional semi-local RECPs if comparable gaussian expansions are used for the partial poten-
tials. The more critical point is that the eﬀort in the calculation and transformation of
two-electron integrals is always substantially higher than that in the computation of RECP
integrals for all known RECP versions (including GRECPs) when appropriately large basis
sets are employed in the precise calculations.

III. FROZEN-CORE APPROXIMATION FOR THE OUTER-CORE SHELLS

To perform precise calculations of chemical and spectroscopic properties, correlations
should be taken into account not only within the valence regions of heavy atoms and heavy-
atom molecules but in the core regions and between the valence and core electrons as well.
In practice, the goal is to achieve a given level of accuracy by correlating as small a number
of electrons as possible, thus reducing the computational eﬀort. However, as discussed in
the Introduction, the accuracy of the RECPs generated for a given number of explicitly
treated electrons cannot always satisfy the accuracy requirements expected from correlating
all these electrons in the corresponding all-electron calculation. This is true, in particular,
for calculations of Tl, having a 5d106s26p1 leading conﬁguration in the ground state, and its
compounds.

To obtain an accuracy on the order of 400 cm−1 for the 2P o

3/2 splitting in the
ground state and for excitation energies to low-lying states of Tl and to take account of the
core polarization, one should correlate at least 13 electrons, i.e. include the 5d shell. This is

1/2 − 2P o

4

achieved in the present MRD–CI calculations with f and g basis functions describing mainly
polarization of the 5d shell (for other recent results see, e.g., [1,3,4]). Some data from our
13e-CI calculations of the SO-splitting in the ground state of Tl are collected in Table I in
comparison with the 3e-CI results, which in our DF/CI and GRECP/CI calculations have
errors of about 600 cm−1.

We also should mention the recent relativistic coupled-cluster (RCC) results of Landau
et al. [7], in which 35 electrons are correlated and a decrease of close to 90 cm−1 in the above
mentioned SO splitting is due to the Breit interaction. Note that this interaction is not yet
taken into account in the RECPs considered in the present work.

Obviously, the 5d shell should also be explicitly treated in calculations of molecules
containing Tl to take into account core relaxation and polarization eﬀects with satisfactory
accuracy. For these calculations it would be optimal to use the RECPs with 13 electrons
of Tl treated explicitly (13e-RECPs) such as the RECP of Ross et al. [19] or our valence
RECP version [15]. None of the known nodeless 13e-RECPs can provide the aforementioned
accuracy, however. Although single-conﬁgurational tests [14,15] give errors of 100 cm−1 or
somewhat more for excitation energies to low-lying states, they are dramatically increased for
13e-RECPs if all 13 electrons are correlated. The reasons are discussed in the Introduction
(one can also see the results of the 13e-RECP/MRD-CI calculations in Ref. [5] and of the
13e-PP/MRCI calculations in Ref. [4]).

To overcome this disadvantage, one should use RECPs with at least 21 electrons, e.g.
21e-GRECP [14,15] and 21e-PP [4] for Tl. The 5s and 5p pseudospinors can be treated
as frozen, however, while still providing the aforementioned accuracy. The 5p orbitals have
energies about four times higher and their average radii are 1.4 times shorter than those
for the 5d orbitals. Moreover, their angular correlation is supressed as compared with the
5d shell because the most important polarization functions (5d for the 5p orbitals and 5p
for the 5s orbitals) are completely occupied in the lowest-lying states. Therefore, the 5s, 5p
orbitals are substantially less active in chemical processes.

In order to freeze the 5s and 5p pseudospinors, one can apply the energy level shift
technique [13]. Following Huzinaga et al. [20], one should add the matrix elements of the
SCF ﬁeld operators (the Coulomb and spin-dependent exchange terms) over these OC pseu-
dospinors to the one-electron part of the Hamiltonian together with the level shift terms

Xncf ,l,±

Bncf l± ePncf l±(r) ,

(12)

where Bncf l± is at least of order |2εncf l±| and εncf l± is the orbital energy of the OC pseu-

dospinor eφncf l±(r) to be frozen. Such nonlocal terms are needed in order prevent collapse

of the molecular orbitals to the frozen states (the 5s1/2, 5p1/2,3/2 pseudospinors for Tl). All
terms with the frozen core pseudospinors described here (the Coulomb and exchange inter-
actions, and the level shift operator) can easily be presented in spin-orbit form with the help
of eq. (6), as was done above for the GRECP operator.

More importantly, these OC pseudospinors can be frozen in calculations with spin-orbit
basis sets and they can already be frozen at the stage of calculation of the one-electron
matrix elements of the Hamiltonian, as implemented in the MOLGEP code [21]. Thus,
any integrals with indices of the frozen spinors are completely excluded after the integral
calculation step.

In single-conﬁgurational calculations with the numerical HFJ code [15] we have seen
that the SO splitting of the 5p shell increases the resulting SO splitting of the 2P o ground
state by about 400 cm−1, whereas the SO splitting of the 5d shell decreases the ﬁnal SO
splitting by almost the same value. Therefore, it is important to freeze the 5p1/2 and 5p3/2
(pseudo)spinors and not some averaged 5p (pseudo)orbitals if the SO interaction is to be
taken into account in the 5d and valence shells.

In Ref. [4], the 21e-“energy-adjusted” Pseudopotential (PP) having the features which
have been emphasized [13–15,22] as inherent for GRECPs (diﬀerent potentials for the 5p
and 6p pseudospinors in the case of Tl) is generated and applied to the calculation of the SO
splitting in Tl, with the core correlations described by the core polarization potential (CPP).
Some average OC pseudoorbitals are frozen and the SO splitting of 7810 cm−1 obtained in
their 21e-PP/MRCI calculation is quite diﬀerent than our result.

After applying the projection operator of eq. (6) to the level shift (12), Coulomb and ex-
change terms with the frozen core pseudospinors, the AREP and ESOP parts of the GRECP
operator are to be modiﬁed to include these new contributions. This technique was success-
fully employed in our earlier calculations of the spin-rotational Hamiltonian parameters in
the BaF and YbF molecules [23].

The freezing technique discussed above can be eﬃciently applied to those OC shells for
which the spin-orbit interaction is clearly more important than the correlation and relaxation
eﬀects. If the latter eﬀects are neglected entirely or taken into account within “correlated”
GRECP versions [13], the corresponding OC pseudospinors can be frozen and the spin-orbit
basis sets can be successfully used for other explicitly treated shells. This is true for the
5p1/2,3/2 subshells in Tl, contrary to the case of the 5d3/2,5/2 subshells. Freezing the OC
pseudospinors allows one to optimize an atomic basis set only for the orbitals which are
varied or correlated in subsequent calculations, thus avoiding the basis set optimization
for the frozen states and reducing the number of the calculated and stored two-electron
integrals. Otherwise, if the 5p shell should be correlated explicitly, a spinor basis set can be
more appropriate than the spin-orbit one.

IV. THE MRD-CI METHOD

In the multireference single- and double-excitation CI approach [24], the ΛS-basis sets of
many-electron spin-adapted (and space symmetry-adapted) functions (SAFs) are employed.
This method makes use of conﬁguration selection and perturbative energy extrapolation
techniques [24] and employs the Table CI algorithm [25] for eﬃcient handling of the various
open-shell cases which arise in the Hamiltonian matrix elements. Some new features of the
selection scheme used in this work are considered below. The higher excitations in the CI
treatment has been assessed by applying the generalized multireference analogue [27] of the
Davidson correction [26] to the extrapolated T =0 energies of each root.

After selecting the ΛS-sets of SAFs for a chosen threshold Ti (i = 1, 2), they are collected
together in accord with the relativistic double-group symmetry requirements and a spin-orbit
CI (SO-CI) calculation is performed with these SAFs to obtain some SO-roots (ΨSO,Ti
)
and their energies (E SO,Ti
) which are of interest in a considered double group irreducible
representation (irrep). Then the linear T =0 correction is evaluated in the basis of the

I

I

6

calculations with the T1 and T2 thresholds. Finally, the generalized Davidson (or full CI)
correction is applied to each root of interest.

The stage of the molecular spectroscopic constants calculation begins with the ﬁtting
of the relativistic CI potential curves to polynomials which are employed to construct ap-
propriate Born-Oppenheimer nuclear motion Schr¨odinger equations solved by the Dunham
method with the help of the DUNHAM-SPECTR code of Mitin [28].

A. Features of the spin-orbit selection procedure

Let us deﬁne a Hamiltonian H for a molecule as

H = H(0) + Vcorr + HSO,

(13)

where H(0) is an unperturbed spin-independent Hamiltonian, Vcorr is a two-electron oper-
ator describing correlations, and HSO is a one-electron spin-orbit operator (ESOP in our
case). Let us choose an orthonormal basis set of SAFs {Φ(n)ΛS
} in the ΛS-coupling scheme
(or “spin-orbit” basis set). In particular, these SAFs can be solutions of Hartree-Fock equa-
tions with a spin-averaged RECP for the molecule considered. The H(0) Hamiltonian is
constructed to be diagonal in the given many-electron basis set:

I

H(0)Φ(n)ΛS

I

= E(n)ΛS

I

Φ(n)ΛS

I

,

(14)

where n = 0, 1, . . . (see below the description of the indices in more detail). Additionally
deﬁne H(0) so that

< Φ(n)ΛS

I

|H(0)|Φ(n)ΛS

I

> ≡ < Φ(n)ΛS

I

|H|Φ(n)ΛS

I

>

(15)

in order to exclude the ﬁrst-order PT contributions to total energies of molecular states (this
corresponds to the Epstein-Nesbet PT form).

We will ignore the two-electron spin-dependent (Breit) interactions which ordinarily can
be neglected when studying chemical and spectroscopic properties. Breit and other quantum
electrodynamic (QED) eﬀects are relatively large for lanthanides and actinides, but for the
V and OC shells they can be eﬃciently represented by the one-electron j-dependent RECP
terms.

Let us distinguish the following types of many-electron functions which are considered

in a double-group symmetry:

and their energies (16) at n = 2; a SAF Φ(2)ΛS
should be selected in accordance with
some selection criteria to be used in the ﬁnal SO-CI calculation. In principle, triple
and higher excited sets of SAFs can be similarly deﬁned.

I

The correlation operator, Vcorr, has the symmetry of the molecule and, therefore, can

be rewritten as

Vcorr ≡ XΛS

PΛSVcorrPΛS .

(21)

It normally gives the most important contribution through the second-order Brillouin-
Wigner PT energy correction in the basis set of Φ(n)ΛS
(after appropriate redeﬁnition of
H(0) in the subspace of Mains, see Ref. [29,30]):

operator). A similar expression with the replacements Ψ(0)ΛS
can
be applied for excited states ΨΛS
(some precautions should be taken concerning the degen-
erate states and the orthogonality constraints with respect to the lower-lying states with
J < I). As a result, the ﬁrst rows, columns and energies on the diagonal of the Hamiltonian

for n = 1, 2 are usually employed in the selection procedures for SAFs {Φ(1,2)ΛS
} based on
the nonrelativistic Ak and Bk approximations (when HSO is not taken into account) [29,30]
or on the multi-diagonalization scheme [24] for subsequent calculations of ΨΛS
. In spite of
some diﬀerences between these selection schemes, they are not very essential for the ﬁnal
CI results if a high quality reference set (set of Mains) and a suitably small threshold are
chosen.

For molecules with heavy and very heavy atoms, the HSO operator can give large contri-
butions to the energy both in second and in higher PT orders if a non-optimal set of Mains,
{Φ(0)ΛS
}, is chosen after an SCF calculation with the SO-averaged potentials (AREPs). The
latter is the usual practice and the set of Mains generated in such a manner can be smaller
than optimal for the case of large SO interaction. Therefore, not only second but third and
maybe even higher PT order(s) can be important in the selection procedure for a “bad”
set of the starting roots Ψ(0)SO
. This means that the oﬀ-diagonal matrix elements of H be-
tween secondary many-electron basis functions (SE-, DE-SAFs) may be introduced into the
selection procedure because HSO is a substantially oﬀ-diagonal operator contrary to Vcorr:

(ΛS) and (Λ′S ′) can be diﬀerent, n′ ∈ {n, |n ± 1|} . (24)

In particular, HSO gives zero matrix elements between SAFs belonging to the same ΛS-irrep
in the D2h or C2v symmetry groups.

For simplicity, let us consider the selection scheme based on the Ak approximation (22).
In the nonrelativistic-type selection scheme, a SAF Φ(1,2)ΛS

by taking into account eq. (21) in the calculation of the matrix elements for Vcorr, contrary
to those for HSO. In spite of mixing diﬀerent ΛS-states due to HSO, the number of non-zero
matrix elements with HSO in eq. (29) is usually relatively small because the SO interaction
is a one-electron operator (see eq. (24)) which is very localized compared with the long-range
Coulomb interaction. Thus, one can see that the nonrelativistic-type selection due to Vcorr
with respect to {PΛSΨ(0)SO
} in each considered ΛS-irrep and automatic selection of all SE-
SAFs {Φ(1)ΛS
} (19) can be eﬃciently applied instead of eq. (26). It must be emphasized that
contrary to the selection schemes in the nonrelativistic case, SE-SAFs should be generated
with respect to the Mains from all the used Λ′S ′-irreps. In a more simpliﬁed treatment, the
automatic selection of SE-SAFs can be done with respect to a subset of the most important
Mains, e.g. having largest CI-coeﬃcients in the Ψ(0)SO

roots.

Next let us consider the terms from the third-order PT energy (PT-3) for SAFs {Φ(1,2)ΛS
}
which can be essential for the SO selection procedure. Below we shall discuss only matrix
elements in the PT numerators of the corresponding PT-3 terms because speciﬁc expressions
for the energy denominators are not essential for our analysis and conclusions. For simplicity,
we shall omit the terms conjugate to those considered.

The ﬁrst two types of the PT-3 matrix elements are:

The ﬁrst intermediate state, Φ(1)ΛS
, is a test SE-SAF and the indices for other intermediate
SAFs run over all the allowed ones. The PT-3 terms summed over the indices of the second
intermediate state give contributions (together with the conjugate terms) for the selection
of the test SE-SAF. However, the SE-SAFs can be selected automatically and these terms
are out of our particular interest.

and Φ(1)Λ′S′

can be used for the selection of Φ(1,2)ΛS
when summing over another set of
intermediate states in the PT-3 expression. As one can see, this term can be used for the
selection of both SE-SAFs and DE-SAFs. The above expression is quadratic in the (large)
HSO interaction contrary to the remaining terms considered below. The contribution of the
terms with matrix elements (32) can be essential and their use for the selection of DE-SAFs
Φ(2)ΛS

can be important for a subsequent SO-CI calculation.

The following matrix element types contain a second order perturbation in Vcorr and,
therefore, we can suggest that in general they are less important for our consideration than
the above terms:

can be analyzed separately because it contains both the intermediate states as DE-SAFs.
In general, it is more diﬃcult to take such terms into account in the selection procedure,
because of the large number of tested DE-SAFs. We should note, however, that when a
tested Φ(2)ΛS

which are only singly excited with respect to the tested one. Therefore, the number of them
will not be very high.

This term is of nonrelativistic type and it is out of our particular interest because it does
not contain the HSO perturbation. Again, we can separate the term

from the previous one only because the latter contains both the DE-SAF intermediate states.
We should emphasize that the terms containing SE- or DE-SAFs in the intermediate
states of the PT-3 expressions are not taken into account in the Bk and multi-diagonalization
selection procedures, although these schemes include, in fact, contributions of higher than
the second-order PT terms.

, by new reference states, Ψ(0+1)SO

When analyzing the above PT-3 terms, it can be concluded that if one replaces the
reference SO roots, Ψ(0)SO
, which diagonalize the complete
Hamiltonian H for the sets of both Mains and SE-SAFs taken together, and applies the
selection criterion based on the second-order PT (26), then the main part of the above PT-3
terms will be taken into account in such a selection. An exception occurs for terms (35) and
(37), but in general they are thought to be less important than the other third-order PT
terms.

In a more sophisticated treatment, the reference Ψ(0+1′)SO

SO states can be generated
when diagonalizing H for the sets of Mains and those SE-SAFs ({Φ(1′)ΛS
}), which are au-
tomatically generated with respect to the most important subset of Mains ({Φ(0′)ΛS
}). The
latter subset can be selected from a preliminary CI calculation for the set of Mains, e.g.
in a basis of conﬁgurations with the highest CI coeﬃcients in Ψ(0)SO
, and so on. This is
worthwhile in order to reduce the number of SAFs in the resulting reference states Ψ(0+1′)SO
rather than in Ψ(0+1)SO
, thus reducing the selection time which can otherwise be very large.
We should also note that the trial SE- and DE-SAFs, which are tested in the above
selection procedure, are generated only for the set of Mains and not for the {Φ(0+1′)ΛS
} set.
Therefore, the number of the tested conﬁgurations and the selection time are reasonably
limited. If the number of conﬁgurations used in {Φ(0+1′)ΛS
} is not high, one can extend the
set of Mains by including the above subset of SE-SAFs, thus obviously enlarging the set of
the consequently generated and tested SE- and DE-SAFs.

As an alternative to the above selection schemes with respect to the PT energy, the PT

Such a means of selection can be preferable if those properties of primary interest cannot
be calculated from potential energy curves or surfaces. Moreover, the PT selection with
respect to both the energy and the CI coeﬃcients can be applied simultaneously if the
properties are of diﬀerent nature.

V. CALCULATIONS

In the CI calculations of Tl and TlH we used the MRD-CI package [24] combined with
the SO selection codes based on the scheme described above. Our test calculations have
shown that spin-orbit selection is very helpful for preparation of appropriate sets of Mains
and for reducing eﬀort in the ﬁnal CI calculations with an optimal set of selected SAFs.

A. Spin-orbit splitting in the ground state of Tl

Calculations for the Tl atom were performed to optimize the basis set and the level shift
GRECP parameters for the 21e/8fs-GRECP, i.e. the 21 electron GRECP with 8 electrons
occupying the frozen OC pseudospinors, 5s1/2 and 5p1/2,3/2. The quality of the generated
basis set is analyzed by calculating the 2P o

3/2 splitting for the ground state.

1/2 − 2P o

The optimal basis set was selected in a series of MRD-CI calculations for Tl (with diﬀerent
sets of primitives and numbers of contracted s, p, d, f and g functions) to minimize the sum
of energies for the ground 2P1/2 and 2P3/2 states.
In these calculations, the SAFs were
selected in the 2B1u, 2B2u, and 2B3u irreps of the D2h group (nonrelativistic-type degenerate
2P ground states belong to these irreps) because these doublets are strongly mixed by the
SO interaction, resulting in the splitting of the ground 2P state. We have found that two g
functions should be added to the basis set, giving a contribution of about 9000 cm−1 to the
2P o ground state total energies. The resulting [4,4,4,3,2] basis set and GRECP parameters
for Tl can be found on http://www.qchem.pnpi.spb.ru.

12

For the [4,4,4,3,2] basis set we have also performed MRD-CI calculations including SAFs
from the 2Au irrep and SAFs with quartet multiplicity (4B1u, 4B2u, 4B3u, and 4Au). In our
calculations with diﬀerent basis sets, their contributions have decreased the SO splitting by
about 170 cm−1 and the total energy by about 2000 cm−1. One can see from Table I that this
decrease is mainly caused by the p- and d-components which arise from reexpansion of the
leading spinor conﬁguration in terms of the spin-orbit conﬁgurations. For good accuracy we
can recommend the inclusion of Λ′|S ± 1|-irreps for the calculation of states having leading
conﬁgurations in ΛS-irreps.

In Table I some of our ﬁnal MRD-CI results are collected together with the atomic
relativistic coupled-cluster (RCC) results [6] obtained with a very large basis set. In these
MRD-CI calculations altogether 627 Mains in three basic irreps and about 100 Mains in
ﬁve additional irreps were involved and SE-SAFs were automatically generated for three
Mains to prepare the reference {Ψ(0+1′)SO
}3
I=1 states. Relatively small thresholds, T1=0.03
and T2=0.01 µEh, are used in the ﬁnal runs with the [4,4,4,3,2] basis set (for the T =0
threshold and full-CI extrapolations), thus selecting respectively about 190000 and 450000
SAFs altogether.

I

One can see that the best SO splitting calculated in the present work underestimates
the experimental result [31] by about 400 cm−1 (recall that additionally about 90 cm−1
is due to the Breit interaction [7]). Analyzing our previous GRECP/RCC calculations of
Hg [37] it can be concluded that this occurs due to the neglect of the OC-V correlations
with the OC 5p and 4f shells, and to a lesser extent with 5s rather than due to the atomic
basis set incompleteness, the GRECP errors or the restricted CI approximation. The OC-
V correlation (contribution to the total energy) in Tl and Hg will have the same order of
magnitude for respective pairs of correlated electrons (spinors).

We also studied the reliability of the linear T →0 extrapolation procedure currently used
in the MRD-CI code. In the ﬁnal results of our MRD-CI calculations the corresponding
correction gives the highest contribution to the cumulative error. So this is a bottleneck of
the present Tl and TlH calculations with the large number of Mains.

B. Spectroscopic constants of the ground state in TlH

The explicit treatment of 5d electrons in precise TlH (TlX) calculations is necessary not
only due to the strong correlation between these and the valence electrons of Tl, but also
because of the substantial inﬂuence of relaxation-polarization eﬀects in this shell on the bond
formation. This cannot be very accurately taken into account by employing a polarization
potential [32,33] in combination with, e.g., 3e-RECPs [14,15]. The inﬂuence of other atoms
(X) in a TlX molecule on the 5p, 5s and 4f shells of Tl is signiﬁcantly smaller and can
be neglected if an accuracy of a few hundreds of wavenumbers for the excitation energies
of low-lying states is suﬃcient. We neglected their contributions in calculation of the TlH
spectroscopic constants.

In calculating spectroscopic properties for the TlH ground state (Table II) we used the
contracted [4,4,4,3,2] basis set for thallium discussed above and the [4,3,1] set for hydrogen
(see http://www.qchem.pnpi.spb.ru) contracted from the primitive (6,3,1) gaussian basis set
of Dunning [38]. The SAFs were selected in the 1A1, 3B1, 3B2 and 3A2 ΛS-irreps of the

13

C2v group because the triplet states are most strongly admixed by the SO interaction to the
nonrelativistic 1A1 (or 1Σ+ in C∞v) ground state producing the relativistic 0+ ground state
in the double C ∗

∞v group.

0

We have performed three series of TlH calculations for 16 interatomic distances. In these
runs, the Ψ(0+1′)SO
reference SO states are generated with the MRD-CI code by diagonalizing
H for the set of Mains and the SE-SAFs which are automatically selected with respect to the
single conﬁguration SCF ground state (calculated with the SO-averaged GRECP), giving a
contribution of more than 90 % to the ﬁnal wave function.

The ﬁrst run is used for preparing an optimal set of Mains for the second series of SO-CI
calculations. Only one SCF conﬁguration which has the lowest energy in each ΛS-irrep is
included into the subspace of ΛS Mains and, consequently, the SO reference state consists of
these SCF conﬁgurations and the automatically selected SE-SAFs with respect to the SCF
conﬁguration from the 1A1 irrep.

Those SAFs were selected as Mains for the second run which had the highest CI coeﬃ-
cients in the ﬁrst run. As a result, 37 Mains in all irreps together are employed in the second
run. Relatively small thresholds, T1=1.0 and T2=0.1 µEh, are used in the second run (for
the T →0 extrapolation [24]), thus causing about 20000 and 85000 SAFs to be selected in
the ΛS-irreps altogether.

In the most computationally consuming third run (with the set of Mains consisting of the
SAFs having the largest CI coeﬃcients in the wave function from the second run), about 320
Mains are used altogether and the thresholds are set at T1=0.1 and T2=0.05 µEh. About
70000 and 130000 SAFs, respectively, were used in the ΛS-irreps altogether in the ﬁnal
SO-CI calculations.

One can see from Table II that the basis set superposition error (BSSE) (see [39] and
references) must be taken into account for an accurate computation of spectroscopic con-
stants. The BSSE was studied in the Tl+ ion calculations for the same interatomic distances
as in TlH and estimated also in the Tl− calculations for three distances, i.e. with the ghost
H atom. The same molecular basis set as in TlH was used for both the Tl and H atoms.
The contribution from BSSE to the total energy is decisive for the 5d10 and 6s2 shells con-
sidered in the case of Tl+, while its changing due to addition of the 6p electrons (which are
bonding in TlH) can be considered as relatively small, because the diﬀerence in BSSE for
Tl+ and Tl− is not signiﬁcant in comparison with other errors. In the calculations of the
spectroscopic properties with the counterpoise corrections (CPC), the calculated TlH points
on the potential curve were corrected with the calculated BSSE for Tl+, i.e. for the 5d, 6s
shells taken into account.

One can see that after applying the T=0, FCI, and counterpoise corrections, the calcu-
lated properties are in very good agreement with the experimental data both in the second
and third runs. The accuracy obtained is notably better than for other existing results for
TlH (and not only for those presented in Table II). We suggest, however, that the very good
agreement of the calculated De with the experimental value can be fortuitous and the “real”
(full CI) value can be notably diﬀerent from the listed one because of the approximations
made.

VI. RESUME

The SO splitting in the ground 2P state of Tl is calculated by the MRD-CI method
with the 21e-GRECP when 5d10, 6s2 and 6p1 electrons are correlated and the 5s2 and 5p6
pseudospinors are frozen in the framework of the level shift technique. A [4,4,4,3,2] basis set
is optimized for Tl and an underestimation of about 400 cm−1 is found for the SO splitting
as compared with the experimental data.

Further improvement of the accuracy can be attained when correlations with the outer
core 4f, 5p and 5s shells of Tl and Breit eﬀects are taken into account. We expect that
this can be eﬃciently done in the framework of the “correlated” 21e/8fs-GRECP version
in which 13 electrons are treated explicitly as in the present calculation. The inclusion of
h-type functions is also desirable, as has been demonstrated for Hg in Ref. [37].

Fourteen electrons are correlated in the calculation of spectroscopic constants for the 0+

ground state of TlH and very good agreement with the experimental data is found.

The developed spin-orbit selection scheme and code are demonstrated to be eﬃcient
when large sets of basis functions and reference conﬁgurations are required in high-precision
electronic-structure calculations.

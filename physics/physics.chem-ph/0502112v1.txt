Abstract

A kink-based path integral method, previously applied to atomic systems, is modiﬁed and used to

study molecular systems. The method allows the simultaneous evolution of atomic and electronic

degrees of freedom. Results for CH4, NH3, and H2O demonstrate this method to be accurate for

both geometries and energies. Comparison with DFT and MP2 level calculations show the path

integral approach to produce energies in close agreement with MP2 energies and geometries in

close agreement with both DFT and MP2 results.

INTRODUCTION

The development of simulation methods that are capable of treating electronic degrees

of freedom at ﬁnite temperatures is necessary for the study of a variety of important

systems including those with multiple isomers with similar energies (such as metal clus-

ters) and with dynamic bond breaking/forming processes. A fundamental diﬃculty in

using ab initio quantum approaches to study systems at ﬁnite temperatures is the need

for most algorithms to solve a quantum problem (to ﬁnd,

for example, the ab initio

forces) at each geometric conﬁguration. Thus the CPU requirement per time or Monte

Carlo step often prevents a simulation. Feynman’s path integral formulation of quantum

mechanics[1] oﬀers the possibility of simultaneously treating geometric and electronic de-

grees of freedom without the restriction of solving a quantum problem for ﬁxed atomic

positions. In addition, temperature and electron-electron correlation can be included and

make this approach very tempting as a starting point for ab initio simulations. An un-

fortunate aspect of the path integral approach is the so-called “sign problem” which can

make the standard deviations of estimated quantities (such as energy) too large for prac-

tical use[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23]. This

problem occurs because the quantum density matrix is not positive deﬁnite and results

in averages being determined from sums of large numbers with diﬀerent signs. The Car-

Parinello implementation of density functional theory[24] is motivated by needs similar to

the ones described above and treats electronic and geometric degrees of freedom on a similar

footing and allows both types of degrees of freedom to propagate simultaneously during a

calculation. A limitation of this approach, though, is the need for the electronic degrees of

freedom, as described using single particle orbitals, to be very close to the lowest energy set

of orbitals, forcing the use of small time steps in a molecular dynamics simulation.

We have recently introduced[19, 20] a ”kink-based” path integral approach and have

demonstrated that it can be used to overcome the ”sign problem” in atomic systems. In

the present work a formalism appropriate for molecular systems is developed. To construct

a practical approach, an approximation to the exact path integral approach is made; the

approximation is based on the results of our previous work. The method treats the electronic

structure as consisting of ground and excited single determinant states built from atom-

based orbitals. Simulations include moves that perform unitary transformations of the

2

single particle orbitals, additions and deletions from a list of excited states used to evaluate

the energy, and moves of atoms. Using this procedure, electronic and geometric degrees of

freedom are treated simultaneously. The method is used with success to calculate the average

energies and geometries of CH4, NH3, and H2O at ﬁnite temperatures. We deﬁne success as

(a) overcoming the sign problem, (b) not requiring low energy orbitals, (c) average molecular

geometries in agreement with previous ab initio calculations, and (d) average energies that

compare favorably with previous ab initio calculations.

II. KINK-BASED PATH INTEGRAL FORMULATION

Our previous work[19, 20] started with the path integral expression for the canonical

partition function, evaluated with ﬁxed geometries and in a discrete N-electron basis set{|j >

Q({|j >}) = T r {exp(−βH)} =

< j| exp(−βH)|j >

Making the Trotter approximation and discretizing the path into P segments, we ﬁnd

Q (P, {|j >}) =

< ji| exp(−βH/P )|ji+1 >

j
X

P

 

i=1
Y

ji !
X

This can be interpreted as a path in the space of states that starts and ends with state

|j1 >.

If |ji >= |ji+1 >, we have a diagonal matrix element, otherwise we have an oﬀ-

diagonal matrix element. Any place that an oﬀ-diagonal element appears is called a ”kink”

and it is clear that the paths can be classiﬁed into those paths with zero kinks, 2 kinks, 3

kinks, etc. We demonstrated[19, 20] that in terms of kinks

β = 1/kBT , P is the discretizing variable in the path integral formulation, n is the number

of kinks, sj is the number of times a particular state appears in the sum, and m is the

number of distinct states that appear (

m
j=1 sj = n). As written, Eqn. 3 is amenable to a
Monte Carlo simulation. However, since the matrix elements can be negative, the usual sign

P

problem will occur if the states are not well chosen. In our previous work[19, 20], the initial

N-electron states |j > were chosen to be simple, anti-symmetrized products of 1-electron

orbitals. The N-electron states were improved by periodically diagonalizing the Hamiltonian

in the space of those states that occurred during the simulation. The result was that the ﬁnal

states were linear combinations of the initial orbitals (essentially the ”natural spin orbitals”

for the system), the only paths that appeared at the end of the simulation contained 0, 2, or

3 kinks, and the sign problem was reduced to insigniﬁcance. Further, the dimensions of the

density matrix were small enough that the matrix could be kept in memory and transformed

whenever a diagonalization took place; this did not require any matrix elements involving

the initial orbitals, which signiﬁcantly reduced the computational eﬀort.

In the case of geometric degrees of freedom, all matrix elements are referenced to the

initial orbitals and the adaptive scheme used for atomic systems must be modiﬁed for com-

putational eﬃcacy. Our previous work showed that once a good guess for the ground state

was obtained the vast majority of paths contained 0 or 2 kinks. Using an approximate

Hartree-Fock solution as a guess for the ground state, an approximate inﬁnite order summa-

tion of kinks from the ground state is developed (leaving for future work the straightforward

extension to the case of degenerate or nearly degenerate ground states), in which we assume

the most important paths contain many instances of the ground state.

First consider a Hartree-Fock-like approximation to Q(P ).

In the Born-Oppenheimer

approximation, Q is given by

Q = T r {exp (−βH)} =

dRN

< j| exp

−βH(RN

|j >

(6)

Z

(cid:0)

(cid:1)

where we assume N nuclei, Ne electrons, and that {|j >} is a set of Ne-electron orbitals. Each

Ne-electron orbital is expressed as an anti-symmetrized product of 1-electron orthonormal-

ized spin-orbitals |j >= A(φj1αj1, φj2αj2, ..., φjNe αjNe ) and typically these 1-electron spatial
orbitals are expressed in terms of atom-centered orbitals {|χi >} (themselves often sums or

4

“contractions” of gaussian orbitals)

|φj > =

cij|χi >

i
X
and the Hamiltonian matrix elements are expressed in terms of {|χi >}. For a given geome-

try, the Hartree-Fock orbitals will be a unitary transformation of any arbitrary starting set

of orbitals {|φ0

|φHF

k > =

jk |φ0
U HF

j

|jHF > = A(φHF

j1 αj1, φHF

j2 αj2, ...)

Symbolically, we will write this as |jHF >= |U HF j0 > and an arbitrary unitary transforma-

tion as |j >= |U j0 >. Since the trace is invariant with respect to unitary transformations,

Q =

dRN

< j0| exp(−βH(RN )|j0 >

∝

dRN

< U j0| exp(−βH(RN )|U j0 >

Z

where the proportionality constant depends on the number of possible unitary transforms.

Treating the allowed unitary transforms as rotations, the proportionality constant will then

be a proportional to a power of π and the sum over U becomes an integral over rotational

angles. As written, it is clear that a possible algorithm is to view the unitary transforms

as just another degree of freedom to be sampled in a Monte Carlo or molecular dynamics

simulation.

This expression is exact within the use of a ﬁnite set of states and any related basis

set superposition errors. To make progress, we will make approximations to the density

matrix elements < j| exp

−βH(RN )

|k >. The most obvious one is a Hartree-Fock-like

approximation

included in a calculation using Eqn. 13. This expression is an approximation to Eqn. 11

in two respects; the obvious one being the approximation to the density matrix and a less

apparent one that the sum is not independent of U.

In terms of a simulation in which

U is sampled, there is an entropy associated with the diﬀerent U’s which means that not

just U HF will appear, but other U’s, which may result in average energies that are higher

than the Hartree-Fock energy. Of course, sophisticated simulation methods can be used to

minimize the eﬀects of this entropy.

To go beyond the Hartree-Fock approximation and include correlation, consider the dis-

cretized version for Q, Eqn. 3 and write it in the Born-Oppenheimer approximation as

As a ﬁrst step, we assume that the most important paths with at least 2 kinks will consist of

alternating ground and excited states. That is, half of the states will be the ground state and

the other half will be excited states. Assuming as previously stated that the lowest energy

state is non-degenerate, we can write (where now the summation variable n denotes the

number of times the lowest energy state appears in a path and we suppress the dependence

of xj and tij on RN for notational convenience) Eqn. 14 as

where the binomial factor accounts for the number of diﬀerent ways to make the diﬀerent

excited states appear in the path and the factor of 2 appears because the ﬁrst state in the

path can be either the ground or an excited state. Empirically, we have found the the

most important term in the sum over m is the m = 0 term. This can understood from the

following; the ratio of the m = 1 term to the m = 0 is

most important in Eqn. 18 as long as the sum on n is quickly converging.

where the subscripts on the last averages indicate averaging over the geometric degrees of

freedom. So paths of alternating ground and excited states, when only the m = 0 term is

included, should be expected to give an MP2-level result. Eqn. 29 will be accurate when a

very good guess to the lowest energy state corresponding to the Hartree-Fock solution exists

for a given geometry. However, this will not always be the case during a simulation and

Eqn. 29 will be reﬁned by including terms beyond the m = 0 term and more complicated

kink patterns in which there is more than a single excited state between occurrences of the

ground state.

We ﬁrst consider the m > 0 term in Eqn. 18 and consider more complicated kink patterns

later. Note that m > 0 will include Γ1, the ﬁrst derivative of Γ0, and higher order derivatives

of Γ0. We expect, and have veriﬁed in the systems we have studied, that the major correction

to Eqn. 29 contains terms with only Γ1. The derivation of an expression that includes

derivatives up to second order, is possible, but not included in herein. Including only those

terms in Eqn. 18 of less than second order in derivatives of Γ0, we ﬁnd

Eqn. 42 is the principle result of this work and represents an expression that can be used

to simulate a molecular system. There are two computational challenges to using this

equation. The ﬁrst is that the sum over excited states includes all states and can become a

severe bottleneck in a calculation. This issue can be addressed using a limited set of excited

states such as 1- and 2-electron excited states (an approximation made in this work) and

by making a slight modiﬁcation to Eqn. 42 that will enable excited states to be sampled

during the Monte Carlo process. QLED is a function of the ground and excited states,

whose total number can be very large. However, it is expected that only a subset of the

states will contribute signiﬁcantly to the partition function and thus we wish to develop

a Monte Carlo procedure that will limit the number of excited states used to those with

signiﬁcant contributions to the partition function, as judged by a Monte Carlo simulation.

To do this, ﬁrst label the excited states in order of decreasing magnitude of

t2
0j/(x0 − xj)

(approximately an excited state’s contribution to the MP2 energy). Next the excited states
(cid:3)

(cid:2)

are divided into groups of Ng states, with group 1 corresponding to excited states 1 . . . Ng,

group 2 to excited states Ng + 1 . . . 2Ng, etc.

If there is a total of Mg such groups and

QLED(ng) denotes the result obtained using only the ﬁrst ng groups of excited states, QLED

10

becomes

QLED = QLED(Mg)

= QLED(Mg) − QLED(Mg − 1) + QLED(Mg − 1)

= [QLED(Mg) − QLED(Mg − 1)] + [QLED(Mg − 1) − QLED(Mg − 2)] +

· · · + [QLED(1) − QHF ] + QHF

≡ ∆QLED(Mg) + ∆QLED(Mg − 1) + · · · + ∆QLED(1) + ∆QLED(0)

=

∆QLED(j)

Mg

j=0
X

(43)

In this notation ∆QLED(0) ≡ QHF and j can be sampled during the Monte Carlo procedure.

If the states are reasonably ordered, the sum over j should converge for a relatively small

value of j and the matrices involved in evaluating ∆QLED(j) will be manageable in size.

The other time consuming part of any calculation will be the inversion of the matrix I − M0.

Fortunately, this is amenable to parallel computation using standard linear algebra packages

which will aid in the implementation of the method.

III. MONTE CARLO SAMPLING PROCEDURE

A. Rotations of single particle states

Sampling unitary transformations U was accomplished in the following way. Two orbitals

φj and φi were randomly chosen from the list of single particle orbitals. A new pair of orbitals

was formed via a simple unitary transformation

′

′

φ

j = cos θ φj + sin θ φi

φ

i = − sin θ φj + cos θ φi

(44)

(45)

with θ sampled randomly from 0 to 2π. These moves were attempted 40 times each during

a Monte Carlo pass (1000 times during the ﬁrst pass).

B. Addition/removal of kinks

In this preliminary work only single and double ”excitations” from the ground state were

considered as candidates for kinks. That is, the diﬀerence between the ground state and

11

an allowed excited state is the transfer of one or two electrons from occupied orbitals to

unoccupied orbitals. The following scheme was therefore used for addition and removal of

kinks. After sampling the rotations during the ﬁrst Monte Carlo pass, the ground state was

identiﬁed (this state did not change during the remainder of the simulation). A list of states

corresponding to double and single excitations was constructed and used for the remainder

of the simulation (the list would have been updated if the ground state had changed). A

value of Ng = 10 was used and at each Monte Carlo pass included an attempt to increase

or decrease by 1 the value j in Eqn. 43.

C. Moving atoms

Each Monte Carlo pass included an attempt to move each atom in turn, as in a standard

Monte Carlo simulation. When an atom move was attempted, the single particle states were

no longer orthogonal; the orbitals were orthonormalized using the Gram-Schmidt method.

The step size for each move was 0.03 a.u.

IV. SIMULATION DETAILS

Monte Carlo simulations were performed using the sampling procedure described above.

A temperature of 1/kBT = 3000 a.u. (≈ 100K) was used; this was high enough to allow the

relatively large geometric changes required to ﬁnd the global minimum geometries, but not

so high as to introduce large vibrational motion. All molecules were started in planar (and

linear in the case of H2O) geometries to test the ability of the method to ﬁnd the correct

geometry. P = 3 × 1010 and 1000 Monte Carlo passes were performed and averages were

computed using the last 500 passes. One and two-electron integrals were evaluated using

the C version programs included in PyQuante [25] and SCALAPACK[26] routines were

used to perform matrix inversions. The 6-31G basis set was used and two simulations were

performed for each molecule. In the ﬁrst, no kinks were allowed resulting in a simulation

using Eqn. 13. A second simulation was performed using Eqn. 43 providing a simulation

that included correlation. Calculations used 16 processors on the SuperHelix computer at

LSU (www.cct.lsu.edu.) Correlation lengths of the energy and bond lengths ranged from

50-150 Monte Carlo passes, reasonable values given the Monte Carlo step size.

V. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The ﬁrst molecule studied was H2O. Started in a linear geometry, the molecule quickly

became bent and adopted the expected geometry. Fig. 1 shows the variation of total energy

and ground state (HF) energy during the simulation using Eqn. 43. Fig. 2 displays the

evolution of the diﬀerent internuclear distances during the simulation. Several important

features are evident from these ﬁgures. First, the electronic and geometric degrees of freedom

evolve to their equilibrium values in a similar number of Monte Carlo passes. Second,

the ﬂuctuations in the Hartree-Fock energy are quite large (≈.03 a.u. ≈ 19 kcal/mol),

demonstrating that the Monte Carlo procedure does not require a particularly accurate

estimate for the Hartree-Fock ground state. Third, despite the ﬂuctuations in the Hartree-

Fock energy, the correlated energy has small ﬂuctuations, which is to be expected of a

good algorithm. From Fig. 1 and Table I we can compare the correlated and uncorrelated

methods used in this study. The Hartree-Fock estimator (Eqn. 13) results in ﬂuctuations in

the energy estimator that are small and comparable to the ﬂuctuations in the total energy

estimator using Eqn. 43.

Tables I-III summarize the energies and geometries for all simulations. For comparison,

we have calculated the 0 K energies (with and without zero point energy correction) and

geometries using Gaussian 98[27].

Comparing the energies calculated using the path integral simulations with those obtained

using Gaussian 98, we ﬁnd that the path integral results using QLED are in close agreement

with MP2 level energies and in much better agreement with MP2 energies than are the DFT

results. The path integral energies lie above the 0 K ab initio energies, as expected due to

the entropy associated with the unitary transformations and ﬁnite temperature (classical)

vibrational eﬀects. The energies are below the zero point corrected ab initio energies due

to the large zero point energy corrections in these molecules. The average geometries are in

good agreement with ab initio results both in absolute bond lengths and angles and in the

diﬀerences between Hartree-Fock and correlated (MP2/DFT) results, particularly in light

of the ab initio bond lengths and angles being appropriate at 0 K and the path integral

results appropriate at 100 K. The largest diﬀerence between the path integral and ab initio

geometries occurs in NH3, where the bond angles are larger by 2 - 3 degrees in the path

integral calculations. Since the ab initio geometries are obtained at 0 K and there is a

13

relatively low frequency vibrational mode in NH3, we performed a path integral calculation

at a lower temperature to see if the average angles from a simulation came into better

agreement with the 0 K results. A simulation at β = 10000 a.u. (≈ 30 K) resulted in

energies and geometries shown in Table II. The bond angles are found to be in much better

agreement with the 0 K values. In addition, the energies are in better agreement with ab

initio results.

The Monte Carlo procedure selects excited states that make a signiﬁcant contribution

to the partition function. The number of possible 1- and 2- electron excited states range

from 2240 for H2O to 5040 for CH4. The average number of excited states in the simulation

ranges from 400-500. Thus, the Monte Carlo procedure is able to restrict the computational

eﬀort and bodes well for the scaling in larger systems.

VI. CONCLUSION

The kink-based path integral formulation has been extended to molecular systems. An

approximate inﬁnite order summation is used to include Hartree-Fock-like excited states in

the ground state, correlated wavefunction. This procedure is necessary because all matrix

elements are referenced to atom based primitive orbitals, which makes storage of the full N-

electron density matrix too time consuming to be feasible. The estimator developed using

this approach was compared to a Hartree-Fock-like method.

In terms of geometries, the

correlated method compares well with standard ab initio MP2 results (and are signiﬁcantly

better than DFT level results) and the Hartree-Fock-like geometries are in good agreement

with 0 temperature ab initio Hartree-Fock calculations. The treatment of geometric and

electronic degrees of freedom on the same footing is a strength of this method. These initial

results suggest this approach, combined with parallel computing, will provide an important

alternative to standard ab initio methods, as well as the very successful Car-Parrinello DFT

method.

A direct comparison between the computational eﬀort of conventional ab initio ap-

proaches and the kink-based method is somewhat diﬃcult since the bottleneck in a con-

ventional simulation is the solution of the Hartree-Fock problem while in the path integral

calculation a matrix inversion is the time consuming part of the calculation. It is possible,

though, to discuss possible improvements to the kink-based approach. The time to invert a

14

matrix scales with the third power of the number of excited states, which (even with parallel

computing) may prove to be a bottleneck to computational eﬃciency. However importance

reduces the computational eﬀort signiﬁcantly because only matrix multiplications are in-



volved in the actual Monte Carlo moves. Some initial studies with this importance function

showed a signiﬁcant decrease in computational eﬀort with only a minor decrease in precision.

Also of interest is the question of size consistency.

If a system is duplicated n times

into n non-interacting systems, the partition function becomes the product of the individ-

ual partition functions, which will guarantee size consistency. Also of interest from a size

consistency point of view is whether the Monte Carlo estimator reaches this factorization

limit. An examination of the leading terms in Eqn. 18 indicates that Γ0 scales with n and

Γ1 is independent of n. The latter feature can be understood in the following way. The

denominators in Γ0 do not scale with n because the allowed excited states j are localized on

one of the n systems. However, the derivative necessary to obtain Γ1 scales with 1/n. Since

the number of excited states also scales with n, Γ1 will be independent of n. Therefore, the

Monte Carlo estimator for n systems becomes

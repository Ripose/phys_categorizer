Abstract

Calibration ab initio (direct coupled cluster) calculations including basis set

extrapolation, relativistic eﬀects, inner-shell correlation, and an anharmonic

zero-point energy, predict the total atomization energy at 0 K of SO3 to be

335.96 (observed 335.92±0.19) kcal/mol. Inner polarization functions make

very large (40 kcal/mol with spd, 10 kcal/mol with spdf g basis sets) contri-

butions to the SCF part of the binding energy. The molecule presents an

unusual hurdle for less computationally intensive theoretical thermochemistry

methods and is proposed as a benchmark for them. A slight modiﬁcation of

Weizmann-1 (W1) theory is proposed that appears to signiﬁcantly improve

performance for second-row compounds.

I. INTRODUCTION

Neither the sulfuric anhydride (SO3) molecule, nor its importance in atmospheric and

industrial chemistry, require any introduction to the chemist.

SO3 displays somewhat unusual bonding. While it is often cited as a ‘hypervalent

molecule’ in undergraduate inorganic chemistry textbooks, quantitative theories of chemical

bonding such as atoms-in-molecules [1] unequivocally show (see Ref. [2] for a lucid review

and discussion) that there are no grounds for invoking violation of the octet rule in SO3

1

(or, for that matter, most second-row molecules), and that bonding in SO3 is best seen as a

combination of moderately polar σ bonds with highly polar pπ,S, pπ,O bonds.

Previous experience on BF3 [3] and SiF4 [4] suggests that in molecules with several strong

and very polar bonds, basis set convergence will be particularly slow.

In addition, in a

recent calibration study on the anharmonic force ﬁeld of SO3 it was found that the molecule

represented a fairly extreme example of a phenomenon noted previously for second-row

molecules [5–7] — namely the great sensitivity of the SCF part of computed properties to

the presence of so-called ‘inner polarization functions’, i.e. high-exponent d and f functions.

Very recently, Martin and de Oliveira [8] published a standard protocol known as W2

(Weizmann-2) theory that was able to predict total atomization energies of a fairly wide

variety of molecules (including SO2, which is relevant for this work) to better than 0.23

kcal/mol on average (0.18 kcal/mol for molecules dominated by a single reference conﬁgura-

tion). Application of this method to SO3 requires a CCSD (coupled cluster with all single

and double excitations [9]) calculation with 529 basis functions in the C2v nondegenerate sub-

group, which was well beyond our available computational resources, particularly in terms

of disk space.

Very recently, however, Sch¨utz et al. [10] developed a general implementation of integral-

direct correlated methods that made possible, inter alia, CCSD calculations on basis sets

this size on workstation computers. Consequently, we carried out a benchmark calculation

on the heat of atomization of SO3, which is reported in the present work.

Having obtained the benchmark ab initio value, we will assess the performance of some

less computationally demanding schemes. This includes W1 theory [8], which is much more

cost-eﬀective than W2 theory but performs much less well for second-row than for ﬁrst-

row compounds. From an analysis of the SO3 results, we will derive a minor modiﬁcation

(denoted W1′ theory) which in eﬀect largely removes this disadvantage.

II. METHODS

Most electronic structure calculations were carried out using MOLPRO98.1 [11] (with

integral-direct code [10] installed) running on a DEC Alpha 500/500 workstation at the

Weizmann Institute of Science. Some additional calculations were carried out using GAUS-

SIAN 98 [12] running on the same platform.

As in our previous work on SO2 [6], the CCSD(T) electron correlation method [13,14],

as implemented by Hampel et al. [15], has been used throughout. The acronym stands for

coupled cluster with all single and double substitutions [9] augmented by a quasiperturbative

account for triple excitations [13]. From extensive studies (see [16] for a review) this method

is known to yield correlation energies very close to the exact n-particle solution within

the given basis set as long as the Hartree-Fock determinant is a reasonably good zero-

order reference wave function. None of the usual indicators (T1 diagnostic [17], largest

excitation amplitudes, or natural orbital occupancies of ﬁrst few HOMOs and LUMOs)

suggest a signiﬁcant departure from the single-reference regime. (For the record, T1=0.018

for SO3.)

Valence correlation basis sets are built upon the augmented correlation-consistent po-

larized n-tuple zeta (aug-cc-pVnZ, or AVnZ for short) basis sets of Dunning and coworkers

[18,19]. In this work, we have considered AVDZ, AVTZ, AVQZ, and AV5Z basis sets, with

maximum angular momenta l=2 (d), 3 (f ), 4 (g), and 5 (h), respectively. The eﬀect of

inner polarization was accounted for by adding ‘tight’ (high-exponent) d and f functions

with exponents that follow even-tempered series αβn, with α the tightest exponent of that

angular momentum in the underlying basis set and β=2.5. Such basis sets are denoted

AVnZ+d, AVnZ+2d, and AVnZ+2d1f. The largest basis set considered in the present work,

AV5Z+2d1f, corresponds to [8s7p7d5f 3g2h] on sulfur and [7s6p5d4f 3g2h] on oxygen (148

and 127 contracted basis functions, respectively), adding up to 529 basis functions for the

entire molecule. The CCSD calculation in this basis set was carried out using the newly

implemented [10] direct algorithm; all other CCSD and CCSD(T) calculations were done

3

conventionally.

The eﬀect of inner-shell correlation was considered at the CCSD(T) level using two

specialized core correlation basis sets, namely the Martin-Taylor (MT) basis set [20] used

in previous work on SO2 [6], and the somewhat more compact MTsmall basis set that is

used in the W2 protocol [8] for this purpose. Correlation from the sulfur (1s) orbital was

not considered, since this lies too deep to meaningfully interact with the valence orbitals.

Scalar relativistic eﬀects were computed as expectation values of the ﬁrst-order Darwin and

mass-velocity corrections [21,22] for the ACPF (averaged coupled pair functional [23]) wave

function with the abovementioned core correlation basis sets. (All electrons were correlated

in these calculations since relativistic eﬀects are most important for the electrons closest to

energy of 7.794 kcal/mol.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The most striking feature of the basis set convergence at the SCF level (Table 1) is

certainly the great importance of inner polarization functions: augmenting the AVDZ basis

set with two tight functions on S has an eﬀect of no less than 40.5 kcal/mol! The same

operation aﬀects the AVTZ SCF binding energy by 15.7 kcal/mol, and even from AVQZ to

AVQZ+2d the eﬀect is still 8.6 kcal/mol, probably the largest such eﬀect hitherto observed.

In addition augmenting the basis set by a tight f function has an eﬀect of 1.1 kcal/mol

from AVTZ+2d to AVTZ+2d1f, but only 0.16 kcal/mol from AVQZ+2d to AVQZ+2d1f.

Presumably the eﬀect from AV5Z+2d to AV5Z+2d1f will be next to negligible.

Not surprisingly, this translates into a substantial eﬀect on the extrapolated SCF limit. A

geometric extrapolation [25] from the AV{D,T,Q}Z results would yield 153.64 kcal/mol as the

SCF limit, 6.3 kcal/mol less than the AV{T,Q,5}Z+2d1f limit employed in W2 theory. The

AV{D,T,Q}Z+2d limit, on the other hand, if fairly close to the latter at 159.7 kcal/mol. (Our

4

best SCF limit is 159.90 kcal/mol, of which the extrapolation accounts for 0.15 kcal/mol.)

This type of variability is almost completely absent for the correlation energy, where

AVnZ, AVnZ+2d and AVnZ+2d1f largely yield the same answers. Following the W2 proto-

col, the CCSD correlation energy is extrapolated using the A + B/l3 extrapolation formula

of Halkier et al. [26] to CCSD/AV{Q,5}Z+2d1f energies (for which l={4,5}). (For a fairly

comprehensive review of theoretical and empirical arguments in favor of this type of extrap-

olation, see Ref. [8] and references therein.) We thus obtain 165.94 kcal/mol as our best

estimate for the CCSD correlation contribution to TAE. It should be noted that the extrap-

olation accounts for 3.2 kcal/mol of this amount: basis set convergence is indeed quite slow.

We note that the largest direct CCSD calculation took a solid two weeks of CPU time on the

DEC Alpha — a conventional calculation would have required about 60 GB of temporary

disk space, as well as a much higher I/O bandwidth if a reasonable wall time to CPU time

ratio were to be attained.

As a general rule, the (T) contribution converges much more rapidly with basis set

(besides being smaller to begin with) and therefore, we were able to dispense entirely with the

CCSD(T)/AV5Z+2d1f calculation. From CCSD(T)/AV{T,Q}+2d1f results and the A+B/l3

formula, we obtain a basis set limit for the (T) contribution of 20.17 kcal/mol, in which the

extrapolation accounts for 0.57 kcal/mol. Together with the CCSD results, this adds up to

a valence correlation contribution to TAE[SO3] of 186.11 kcal/mol, of which 3.75 kcal/mol

is covered by extrapolations.

The inner-shell correlation contribution (Table 2) at the CCSD(T) level using the Martin-

Taylor [20] core-correlation basis set, was found to be 0.89 kcal/mol with the Martin-Taylor

[20] core correlation basis set, and 0.96 kcal/mol with the somewhat more compact MTsmall

basis set used in W2 theory [8]. Bauschlicher and Ricca [27] found that basis set superposition

error signiﬁcantly aﬀects the inner-shell correlation contribution in SO2. It was evaluated

here using the site-site counterpoise method [28] ; we thus found counterpoise-corrected core

correlation contributions of 0.73 kcal/mol with the Martin-Taylor and 0.68 kcal/mol with

the MTsmall basis sets.

5

Scalar relativistic eﬀects were obtained as expectation values of the mass-velocity and

Darwin operators [22] for the ACPF (averaged coupled pair functional [23]) wavefunction.

Their eﬀect on the computed TAE (with either core correlation basis set) is -1.71 kcal/mol,

comparable to the -1.88 kcal/mol previously found [4] for SiF4. Atomic spin-orbit split-

ting adds another -1.23 kcal/mol to the result. (These latter two terms together imply a

relativistic contribution of -2.94 kcal/mol, or nearly 1% of the atomization energy.)

Finally, we obtain a W2 total atomization energy at the bottom of the well, TAEe, of

344.03 kcal/mol; using the BSSE-corrected inner shell correlation contribution, this value

drops to 343.76 kcal/mol.

In combination with the very accurate ZPVE=7.795 kcal/mol

[24], we ﬁnally obtain, at absolute zero, TAE0=336.17 kcal/mol without, and 335.96 kcal/mol

with, BSSE correction on the core correlation contribution. This latter value is in perfect

agreement with the experimental TAE0=335.92±0.19 listed in the Gurvich compilation [29].

We thus see once more the importance of including BSSE corrections for the inner-shell

correlation part of TAE: it should be noted that while the inner-shell contribution to TAE

is small, the S(2s, 2p);O(1s) absolute correlation energy is comparable with the valence

correlation energy in SO3. BSSE on the valence contribution is much less of an issue since

the basis sets used for valence correlation are much more saturated to begin with, and

furthermore the valence correlation energy is being extrapolated to the inﬁnite-basis limit

where it should vanish by deﬁnition.

The performance of more approximate computational thermochemistry schemes is of

some interest here (Table 3). G1 theory [30] is in error by no less than -11.4 kcal/mol,

which goes down to -6.9 kcal/mol for G2 theory [31] and -5.45 kcal/mol for G3 theory [32].

(Only the latter includes spin-orbit splitting as part of the protocol: none of these methods

consider scalar relativistic eﬀects.) G2(MP2) performs relatively well as a result of error

compensation (-2.4 kcal/mol). The CBS-Q [33] scheme underestimates the true binding

energy by only 1 kcal/mol, while CBS-QB3 [34] is only 0.2 kcal/mol above experiment. It

should be noted that neither CBS-Q nor CBS-QB3 include relativistic eﬀects of any kind as

part of the standard protocol; therefore the excellent performance put in by these methods

6

is to a large extent thanks to error compensation. Finally, the W1 theory of Martin and de

Oliveira — which yields a mean absolute error of about 0.3 kcal/mol for a wide variety of

compounds — has an error in TAE0[SO3] of -1.13 kcal/mol. (W1 theory includes both scalar

relativistic and spin-orbit contributions.)

The largest calculations involved in the W1 protocol are CCSD/AVQZ+2d1f and

CCSD(T)/AVTZ+2d1f, which is still rather more demanding than the steps in any of the

Gn or CBS methods. Hence this performance is rather disappointing — a failure of W1

theory was also noted for SO2 in the original paper [8]. Balance considerations [6] may lead

us to wonder whether an AVTZ+2d1f basis set is not rather top-heavy on inner polarization

functions. Using the AVnZ+2d series favored by Bauschlicher and coworkers (e.g. [27]) in-

deed reduces the discrepancy with experiment by 0.55 kcal/mol (of which 0.20 kcal/mol in

the SCF part). The alternative sequence {AVDZ+2d,AVTZ+2d,AVQZ+2d1f} yields even

better agreement with experiment (and the more rigorous calculations):

in fact, the ﬁnal

value thus obtained falls within the experimental error bar. Particularly encouraging is the

fact that the predicted SCF limit is now within 0.04 kcal/mol of our best estimate. Prelim-

inary calculations on other second-row systems suggest that this procedure, which we will

label W1′ theory, may be preferable over standard W1 theory for second-row systems with

strong inner shell polarization. (The two variants are equivalent for ﬁrst-row compounds.)

As a test, we have taken three molecules for which W1 yields fairly large errors (CS, SO,

and SO2) and repeated the calculation using W1′ theory. Deviations from experiment drop

from -0.92, -0.62, and -1.01 kcal/mol, respectively, to -0.56, -0.32, and -0.02 kcal/mol, respec-

tively, which is not qualitatively diﬀerent from the vastly more expensive W2 calculations

which yielded [8] deviations of -0.51, +0.02, and +0.23 kcal/mol for these molecules. We

conclude that W1′ theory indeed represents an improvement, and recommend it for future

work on second-row systems instead of W1 theory.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

Benchmark ab initio calculations using direct coupled cluster methods predict the total

atomization energy at 0 K of SO3 to be 335.96 (observed 335.92±0.19) kcal/mol. The

computed results includes extrapolation to the basis set limit (3.75 kcal/mol), relativistic

eﬀects (-2.94 kcal/mol), inner-shell correlation (0.68 kcal/mol after BSSE correction), and

anharmonic zero-point energy (7.755 kcal/mol). Inner polarization functions make very large

(40 kcal/mol with spd, 10 kcal/mol with spdf g basis sets) contributions to the SCF part of the

binding energy. The molecule presents an unusual hurdle for less computationally intensive

theoretical thermochemistry methods and is proposed as a benchmark for them. A slight

modiﬁcation of W1 theory [8] is proposed which appears to result in improved performance

for second-row systems with strong inner-shell polarization eﬀects.

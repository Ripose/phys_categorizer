Abstract

The equilibrium geometry, harmonic frequency and dissociation energy of LaCl
have been calculated on B3LYP,MP2,QCISD(T) levels with the energy-consistent
relativistic eﬀective core potentials approximation. The possible electronic state and
reasonable dissociation limit for the ground state of the molecule are determined
based on Atomic and Molecular Reaction Statics (AMRS). The Potential energy
curve scans for the ground state X 1Σ+ have been carried out with B3LYP and
QCISD(T) methods. Analytical Murrell-Sorbie (M-S) potential energy function and
its Dunham expansion form around equilibrium position have also been derived
with a nonlinear least-square ﬁt. The calculated spectroscopic constants are in very
good agreement with experimental results of vibrotational spectra. The analytical
function we got is of much realistic importance due to its use in the calculation of
transitional ﬁne structure and the study of reaction dynamic process.

1 Introduction

The transition metal monohydrides and monohalides have been exten-
sively studied over the years because they are of considerable interest in cat-
alytic chemistry, high-temperature chemistry and astrophysics. In particular
diatomic molecules of La are of great importance as test cases for modeling the
role of the d electron in the chemical bond on account of their simpler open
d shell electronic conﬁgurations. There have been signiﬁcant eﬀorts made in
spectroscopic investigations and ab initio calculations in order to get a bet-
ter understanding of the electronic structure of such molecules. The visible

band systems of LaH,LaF,LaCl are observed subsequently[1–3]. A number of
theoretical calculations also exist using ligand ﬁeld theory and all kinds of ab
initio methods[4–7].

However current theoretical study mainly focuses on the equilibrium struc-
ture. There is only several papers about the calculation of global potential
energy curve of molecule LaH and LaF[8,9], which is not compatible with so
many experimental spectroscopic data. For LaCl, there doesn’t exist any re-
port on the theoretical calculation of its structure and property. Analytical
function completely describes all the molecular properties such as geometry,
energy etc. And the global potential energy curve is signiﬁcant for the inves-
tigation of the collision reaction dynamics when they are used as catalyst.
In this paper we ﬁrstly present the predicted structure, the potential energy
curve and its analytical function form for LaCl molecule with energy-consistent
Relativistic Eﬀective Core Potential (RECP) approximation.

2 Calculation Details

All electron quantum chemical calculation of LaCl is extremely diﬃcult
because of its complex electronic structure and large system. A large num-
ber of low-lying electronic states of diﬀerent spatial and spin symmetries
may mix heavily. Electron correlation and relativistic eﬀects can also be very
considerable, and spin-orbit interactions are often quite important for this
system. Therefore accurate theoretical calculations have to take account all
these eﬀects properly. So far there are two kinds of very eﬀective meth-
ods, which are relativistic eﬀective core potential approximation and rela-
tivistic all electron Density Functional Theory (DFT). In this paper we use
energy-consistent RECPs developed by Stuttgart/Dresden group[10]. There
46 core electrons of La are replaced by eﬀective potentials derived from quasi-
relativistic atomic wave functions. Only the outer 11 valence electrons need
to be treated explicitly in calculation. Valence basis sets are contracted as
(8s7p6d4f2g)/[6s5p4d4f2g], where diﬀuse functions 1s1p1d and polarization
functions 4f2g are included[10]. The exponent of the diﬀuse and polariza-
tion functions are optimized according to even-tempered principle. For Cl
atom Dunning’s augmented correlation consistent triple-zeta basis sets, i.e.
aug-cc-pVTZ, are adopted. We use the methods hybrid density functionals
B3LYP, MP2 (Moller-Plesset correlation energy correction) and QCISD(T)
(quadratic conﬁguration interaction including single and double substitutions
with a triples contribution) to account for electron correlation eﬀects.

3 Equilibrium Geometry Calculation of LaCl

The possible electronic state for the ground state of LaCl may be singlet
1Σ+ or triplet 3∆. These two states are optimized respectively using B3LYP
method of DFT. The optimized bond length is 0.2520nm and 0.2576nm for
singlet and triplet respectively. And the corresponding experimental values,
which is obtained from the spectroscopic constants Be, are 0.2498nm and
0.2547nm. It shows that the calculation on B3LYP level is consistent with
experimental results. Since the calculated energy of singlet is only 0.006eV
above the one of triplet, it is diﬃcult to determine the ground state only
on current theoretical calculation. However, molecule LaCl may have analogy
electronic structure with LaH and LaF. Here we consider the ground state is
X 1Σ+, which is also in accordance with literature [3]. This may be proved by
higher accuracy calculation with larger basis sets.

Table 1 are for bond length, dissociation energy and harmonic frequency
obtained with B3LYP,MP2 and QCISD(T) methods. Compared with the ex-
perimental values, the bond length are 2.2pm,1.6pm larger and 0.6pm smaller
on B3LYP,QCISD(T) and MP2 calculation levels, and the bias for harmonic
frequency are about 10cm−1,1cm−1 and 12cm−1 respectively. As to the dis-
sociation energy, the values of B3LYP and QCISD(T) nearly equal (4.982eV
and 5.045eV), and the value of MP2 is about 1.8eV larger. Though until now
there is no experiment report about the dissociation energy of LaCl, from our
calculations and the experimental value 6.23eV for LaF molecule[11], the rea-
sonable dissociation energy may be near 5.0eV. Therefore the calculations on
B3LYP and QCISD(T) is more consistent with experimental results and we
use them to calculate the potential energy curve for the ground stae of LaCl.

4 Potential Energy Curve and Analytical Function

For the calculation of the potential energy curve, the separated atomic
method can be used to derive the possible electronic state for the ground state
of molecule LaCl[12,13]. The ground electronic sates of La and Cl are 2Dg and
2Pu respectively, which both belong to SU(n) group. The symmetry is degraded
to C∞V when they approach to form the molecule LaCl. So the direct product
of the representation of both atoms can be reduced and the possible electronic
states 1,3Σ+,1,3Σ−,1,3Π,1,3∆,1,3Φ are derived. In addition from the calculated
electronic conﬁguration the state 1Σ+ is got. Therefore the ground state of
LaF molecule is 1Σ+. According to the principle of microscopic reversibility
the dissociation limit for the ground state 1Σ+ can be expressed as

Single point energy calculations are carried out every 0.005nm for B3LYP
and 0.01nm for QCISD(T) when the nuclei separation is between 0.18nm to
0.8nm. The potential energy curves are shown in Fig. 1. Murrell-Sorbie (M-S)
function is one of the best analytical functions which can describe the short-
range and long-range interaction very well. Its form reads

−D(1 + a1ξ + a2ξ2 + a3ξ3)exp(−a1ξ) + D,

where ξ = R/Re −1, R and Re are nuclei distance and its equilibrium value, D
is the dissociation energy. Additionally M-S function can be expanded to fol-
lowing aproximated power series around equilibrium position as what Dunham
did in 1932[14], i.e.

a0ξ2(1 + a1ξ + a2ξ2 + a3ξ3 + a4ξ4 + a5ξ5 + a6ξ6).

These coeﬃcients for the analytical function are calculated by a nonlinear
least-square ﬁt program and they are showed in table 2. The formulae for

which are exhibted in table 3 as well as the ones got by experimental spectrum.

− 12a2

In Fig. 1 the shape of potential energy curves obtained by these two meth-
ods are almost the same from 0.18nm to about 0.5nm. But from 0.5nm, these
two curves begin to separate gradually. The diﬀerence is 0.5-0.6eV when nuclei
distance is 0.8nm. Comparing with the calculated dissociation energy, we can
see potential energy curve got by QCISD(T) does not meet the dissociation
limit of ground state.

All the parameters of M-S analytical function and Dunham expansion co-
eﬃcients ﬁtted from potential energy curves are in table 2. The ﬁtted disso-
ciation energy is 4.956eV for B3LYP method, which is very close to the value
4.982eV calculated at equilibrium position. Its value of QCISD(T) method
is about 0.66eV larger. Using the analytical function, the calculated vibro-
tational constants are in good agreement with them measured in thermal
emission spectrum. The vibrational frequency ωe for the ground state X 1Σ+
is 338.7cm−1, and the experiment value is 341.6cm−1. The discrimination with
harmonic frequency 332.0cm−1 reﬂects the disharmonic eﬀect of electron vi-
brations. With these spectroscopic constants, the vibrotational energy levels
for the ground state of LaCl may be expressed as

[ωe − ωeχe(ν + 0.5)](ν + 0.5) + [Be − αe(ν + 0.5)]J(J + 1)

where ν and J correspond to vibration and rotation quantum number respec-
tively.

5 Conclusions and Discussions

The possible electronic state and its dissociation limit have been deduced
according to the principles of ARMS for the ground state of LaCl. Molecular
structure and basic properties have also been calculated on B3LYP,MP2 and
QCISD(T) levels with energy-consistent relativistic eﬀective core potentials
approximation. The potential energy curves and their M-S analytical functions
and Dunham power series expansions have been obtained with B3LYP and
QCISD(T) methods. The vibrotational spectroscopic constants are in good
agreement with experiment results.

We devise a non-Hermitian Rayleigh-Schr¨odinger perturbation theory for the single- and the
multireference case to tackle both the many-body problem and the decay problem encountered, for
example, in the study of electronic resonances in molecules. A complex absorbing potential (CAP) is
employed to facilitate a treatment of resonance states that is similar to the well-established bound-
state techniques. For the perturbative approach, the full CAP-Schr¨odinger Hamiltonian, in suitable
representation, is partitioned according to the Epstein-Nesbet scheme. The equations we derive in
the framework of the single-reference perturbation theory turn out to be identical to those obtained
by a time-dependent treatment in Wigner-Weisskopf theory. The multireference perturbation theory
is studied for a model problem and is shown to be an eﬃcient and accurate method. Algorithmic
aspects of the integration of the perturbation theories into existing ab initio programs are discussed,
and the simplicity of their implementation is elucidated.

INTRODUCTION

Electronic resonances are temporary states which de-
cay by electron emission. Prominent examples are Auger
inner-
decay [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], electronic decay of
valence ionized clusters [7, 8, 9, 10] or temporary an-
ions [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]. Electronic resonances are
of fundamental importance and their study reveals deep
physical insights into the complex many-body eﬀects gov-
erning molecular physics (see, for example, Refs. [5, 6]).
Resonances cannot be described in terms of bound-
state quantum mechanics because the wave functions are
not part of the L2-Hilbert space, since a particle is emit-
ted into the continuum. Hence, the wave functions are
not square-integrable. Associated with each resonance is
a discrete pole of the S matrix at the complex energy

Eres = ER − i Γ/2.

(1)

This energy is called Siegert energy [17, 18, 19]. ER is
the energetic position of the resonance state and Γ is its
decay width. The Siegert wave function typically displays
a localized part, near the decaying system, resembling a
bound state. Asymptotically, however, the Siegert wave
function diverges [19].

The discrete nature of a Siegert energy and the quasi-
bound behavior of the corresponding wave function in
the vicinity of the decaying system suggest to employ
bound-state techniques in order to treat resonances quan-
titatively. This idea is exploited by a couple of meth-
ods like the stabilization method [20, 21], complex scal-

ing [22, 23, 24, 25], or the use of a complex absorb-
ing potential (CAP) [26, 27, 28].
In the latter two
approaches, the Siegert energy of a resonance is found
as a discrete eigenvalue of a modiﬁed, non-Hermitian
Schr¨odinger equation. The eﬀective Siegert wave func-
tion in this eigenvalue problem is square-integrable, so
that bound-state methods can indeed be applied.

Using a CAP, in particular, oﬀers advantages when
considering electronic resonances in molecules or in other
extended forms of matter [28].
Its implementation in
ab initio packages for bound-state quantum chemistry is
simple and, in some sense, minimally invasive. For ex-
ample, there is no need to modify the calculation of the
Coulomb integrals. Moreover, in principle any electron-
correlation method can be combined with a CAP. For
example, the CAP method was implemented by Som-
merfeld et al. [11] at the multireference conﬁguration-
interaction level. This program, known as CAP/CI, has
already found several interesting applications (see, for
instance, Refs. [12, 29]). More recently, a CAP-based
extension of many-body Green’s functions was devel-
oped [30] and used to perform the ﬁrst ab initio determi-
nation of resonance widths in elastic electron scattering
from chlorobenzene [31].

A very promising strategy for applications to large sys-
tems is treating the CAP-Schr¨odinger eigenvalue problem
in electronic conﬁguration space using perturbation the-
ory. The non-Hermitian perturbation theory derived in
this article, simpliﬁes the practical calculation of elec-
tronic resonance states considerably. We describe the
combination of the method of conﬁguration interaction
with CAPs in Sec. II and study a non-Hermitian single-
reference Rayleigh-Schr¨odinger ansatz in Sec. III. A
generalization to a multireference theory is presented in
Sec. IV. In Sec. V, the performance of the non-Hermitian
multireference perturbation theory is demonstrated for a
model problem. We summarize in Sec. VI.

II. COMPLEX ABSORBING POTENTIALS
AND CONFIGURATION INTERACTION

In order to enable a treatment of decaying states within
the framework of bound-state methods, the molecular
system is enclosed by an appropriate complex poten-
tial, which enforces an absorbing boundary condition.
This artiﬁcial potential, called complex absorbing poten-
tial or CAP, absorbs the emitted particle and conse-
quently transforms the former continuum wave function
into a square-integrable one [9, 27, 28]. The CAP is sim-
ply added to the electronic Hamiltonian ˆH of a molecular
system:

ˆH(η) = ˆH − i η ˆW .

(2)

Here, η is a real positive parameter referred to as CAP-
strength parameter, and ˆW is called CAP operator. It
is possible to choose ˆW as a local one-particle operator.
The exact prerequisites that ˆW must satisfy are derived
in Ref. [27]. A fairly general, ﬂexible CAP for molecu-
lar calculations is presented in Refs. [9, 29].
(See also
Sec. V, Eq. (56) for a typical ˆW .) It should be noted
that the Hamiltonian ˆH(η) in (2) is not Hermitian. Us-
ing the usual Hermitian inner product, it is not possible
to establish an appropriate geometry in the eigenspace
of ˆH(η). The natural choice is the complex symmetric
bilinear form [9, 25, 27, 28, 32]

matrix eigenvalue problem. See Ref. [28] for a discussion
of some of the spectral properties of complex symmet-
ric matrices and of the numerical techniques available
for diagonalizing them. Representing the Hamiltonian of
a many-particle system in a systematically constructed
many-particle basis set and diagonalizing the resulting
matrix is known as the method of conﬁguration interac-
tion (CI) [33]. As CI matrices are in most cases huge,
perturbation theory is often employed to calculate a few
selected eigenstates. In the CAP/CI problem, accelerat-
ing the calculation is even more crucial, since, according
to Eq. (5), ﬁnding the Siegert energy of a resonance re-
quires repeated diagonalization as a function of η.

III. NON-HERMITIAN SINGLE-REFERENCE
PERTURBATION THEORY

The Hamiltonian ˆH of the system is partitioned, fol-
lowing Epstein and Nesbet [34, 35, 36], into an exact,
diagonal part and an oﬀ-diagonal perturbation:

ˆH = ˆH0 + ˆH1
ˆH0 =

| Φj ) ( Φj | ˆH | Φj ) ( Φj |

(7)

ˆH1 =

| Φj ) ( Φj | ˆH | Φk ) ( Φk | .

The CAP operator ˆW is partitioned accordingly. Thus,
employing (2), we obtain

The problem of calculating the complex Siegert energy
of a resonance is equivalent to solving a complex eigen-
value equation, the CAP-Schr¨odinger equation [27]

ˆH(η) | Ψ(η) ) = E(η) | Ψ(η) ) .

(4)

If Eq. (4) is solved in a complete basis set, then there
exists an eigenvalue E(η) such that the Siegert energy
E(η). For a ﬁnite basis set, the
is given by Eres = lim
η→0

limit η → 0 merely recovers an approximation to the
real spectrum of ˆH. In this case, an optimal, ﬁnite η is
sought, employing the condition [9, 27, 28]

of square-integrable many-electron vectors | Φj )—often
eigenvectors of an appropriate Fock operator—is intro-
duced [33]. Typically, the many-electron basis is real.
The matrix representation of both ˆH and ˆW is there-
fore real; that of ˆH(η) is complex symmetric. In other
words, Eq. (4) is transformed into a complex symmetric

ˆH(η) = ˆH0(η) + ˆH1(η) ,

(8)

which can be used as a starting point for a sim-
ple time-independent Rayleigh-Schr¨odinger perturbation
theory [37] based on one reference | Φi ). Clearly, | Φi )
should approximate the compact bound-state-like part of
the resonance wave function. In a time-dependent frame-
work, | Φi ) would describe the discrete, square-integrable
state that undergoes decay through coupling to the con-
tinuum. We refer to | Φi ) as the initial state to emphasize
this fact.

The CAP-Schr¨odinger equation for the unperturbed

part of (8) is

ˆH0(η) | Φj ) = E(0)

for an arbitrary | Φj ) ∈ B, where the unperturbed
eigenenergy E(0)
(η) = ( Φj | ˆH(η) | Φj ) is the expectation
value of the full operator ˆH(η) with respect to | Φj ). Now
the well-known derivation of the Rayleigh-Schr¨odinger
perturbation series [37] can be transferred to the non-
Hermitian case. Up to second order, the energy of the
initial state is given by

Note that in view of Eqs. (7) and (8), the ﬁrst-order

To study the real and imaginary parts of the second-
order correction (10c), we assume that the matrix ele-
ments of both ˆH and ˆW are real, and we introduce an
abbreviated notation:

Hjk := ( Φj | ˆH | Φk )

∆Hjk := Hjj − Hkk

Wjk := ( Φj | ˆW | Φk )
∆Wjk := Wjj − Wkk .

In the limit η → 0, the real part of P2(f ) reduces to

(11)

(12)

(13)

which is the well-known Rayleigh-Schr¨odinger result for
a non-degenerate state. The sum in (10c) becomes an
integral in a complete basis set, and in general the prin-
cipal value of this integral must be taken due to the pole
on the real axis.

Now let

with ε := −η ∆Wif . The last two terms in Eq. (14)
represent an artefact introduced by the CAP. However,
the limit η → 0 implies ε → 0, so that their contribution
to limη→0 Im E(2)

(η) vanishes.

As mentioned previously, the initial state | Φi ) is spa-
tially compact. The only purpose of ˆW is to absorb the
outgoing wave outside the molecular system. It is there-
fore obvious (see Refs. [9, 29]) that ˆW can be chosen in
such a way that Wif vanishes for any f (including f = i).
Employing such a CAP, we ﬁnd, even at ﬁnite η,

Im P2(f ) = −π H 2

if δε(∆Hif ) .

(15)

Using Eqs. (10), (11), (13), and (15), the Siegert en-
ergy, as obtained in second-order perturbation theory in
the limit η → 0, reads

bation theory in second order in combination with the
well-known relation [39]

(18)

In a ﬁnite basis set, treating the delta function in
Eq. (17) requires care. The usual approach is the direct
evaluation of Eq. (17) by exploiting Stieltjes-Chebyshev
moment theory [40], a cumbersome and not always
numerically stable scheme. Non-Hermitian Rayleigh-
Schr¨odinger perturbation theory oﬀers a computation-
ally powerful alternative: The complex energy E(2)
(η)
(Eq. (10c)) is easy to calculate as a function of η, and
optimization of the complex energy in accordance with
Eq. (5) immediately yields a numerical approximation to
the second-order level shift in Eq. (16) and to the decay
width (17).

The energies E(0)

the ﬁrst three terms of a perturbation series expansion
of the Siegert energy associated with | Φi ). Basic insight
into the convergence behavior of such a series can be
gained by analyzing a two-state model [41, 42]. If ˆW is
chosen appropriately, the complex symmetric Hamilto-
nian matrix in a basis consisting of the compact vector
| Φi ) and one diﬀuse vector | Φf ) is simply

H(η; λ) =

where λ controls the strength of the perturbation. The

The expansion of E±(η; λ) in powers of λ converges at
the physically relevant point λ = 1 if |λBP| > 1.
In
the case η = 0, the condition |∆Hif | > 2 |Hif | must
therefore be satisﬁed. However, if decay from | Φi ) into
| Φf ) is eﬃcient, then we expect the energy diﬀerence,
∆Hif , between the two states to be small in comparison

convergence under the condition that |η Wf f | > 2 |Hif |.
The spectrum of the two-state matrix H(η; λ = 1) is
then nondegenerate, which ensures the existence of two
linearly independent eigenvectors [28].

If only a single reference is used to describe the initial
state, it can happen that the optimal η (Eq. (5)) cannot
compensate the quasi-degeneracy of | Φi ) with a number
of pseudo-continuum states | Φf ). Another reason why
the single-reference perturbation series can be divergent
is strong coupling of | Φi ) to other compact states that
are close in energy. Such an eﬀect implies strong elec-
tron correlation and can cause a complete breakdown of
the independent-particle picture [43]. Both insuﬃciencies
can be overcome by using the multireference approach
that is derived in the ensuing Sec. IV.

IV. NON-HERMITIAN MULTIREFERENCE
PERTURBATION THEORY

The degenerate time-independent perturbation theory
is a special multireference technique: A reference sub-
space of degenerate states, belonging to a certain unper-
turbed energy eigenvalue, is taken. Then the representa-
tion of the full Hamiltonian in this subspace is diagonal-
ized to decouple the states and to yield corrections to the
energy in ﬁrst and to the wave function in zeroth order.
If the degeneracy is removed in the new eigenvector ba-
sis, non-degenerate perturbation theory can be applied to
each eigenvector to obtain higher-order corrections [37].
A general multireference approach can be devised anal-
ogously. An arbitrary set of initial states can be taken.
Then one can proceed as described in the previous para-
graph. To carry out this program, we harness an eﬀective
Hamiltonian formalism [44, 45, 46, 47], which has proven
to be a versatile tool in many cases, see e.g. Refs. [48, 49].

A. Eﬀective Eigenvalue Problem

The CAP-Schr¨odinger equation (4) shall be solved
for several complex eigenvalues.
In practice, a K-
dimensional basis B (Eq. (6)) is used to form a complex
symmetric matrix representation of (4). Now n references
are selected from B, say, |Φj), j = 1, . . . , n (n ≪ K).
Projection operators [28, 29, 45, 50] onto the reference
space and its complement space, respectively, are deﬁned
as

ˆP =

|Φj)(Φj|,

ˆQ = ˆ1 − ˆP =

|Φj)(Φj |,

obeying

(24a)

(24b)

Applying (22) and (23) to (4) yields

E(η) ˆP|Ψ(η)) = ˆP ˆH(η) ˆP |Ψ(η))

E(η) ˆQ|Ψ(η)) = ˆQ ˆH(η) ˆP |Ψ(η))

+ ˆP ˆH(η) ˆQ |Ψ(η))

+ ˆQ ˆH(η) ˆQ |Ψ(η)) .

Equation (24b) is solved for ˆQ|Ψ(η)), which yields with
the help of (23)

ˆQ|Ψ(η)) = ˆG(η) ˆQ ˆH(η) ˆP|Ψ(η)) .

(25)

The operator

ˆG(η) := [E(η) ˆ1 − ˆQ ˆH(η) ˆQ]−1

(26)

is the Green’s function [33, 50] of the complement space.
It has a pole where the exact eigenvalue E(η) coincides
with an eigenvalue of ˆQ ˆH(η) ˆQ.

Inserting Eq. (25) into (24a) results in an eﬀective

eigenvalue problem [44, 50, 51, 52, 53]

ˆHeﬀ(η) ˆP|Ψ(η)) = E(η) ˆP|Ψ(η))

(27a)
ˆHeﬀ(η) = ˆP ˆH(η) ˆP + ˆP ˆH(η) ˆQ (27b)
× ˆG(η) ˆQ ˆH(η) ˆP

for the exact eigenvalue E(η) associated with the eigen-
state |Ψ(η)). Equation (27) is no simpliﬁcation but a
convenient reformulation of the original problem, Eq. (4).
Note that the matrix representation of, e.g., ˆP ˆH(η) ˆP is
a K × K matrix PH(η)P with a nonzero n × n subma-
trix. For notational brevity, the K × K matrix PH(η)P
is identiﬁed with the smaller nonzero n × n matrix, i.e.
with the representation of ˆP ˆH(η) ˆP in the reference sub-
space.

The eigenstate |Ψ(η)) can be obtained from its projec-

tion onto the reference space, ˆP|Ψ(η)), by using

|Ψ(η)) = ˆP|Ψ(η)) + ˆQ|Ψ(η)) .

(28)

Inserting Eq. (25) yields

|Ψ(η)) = ˆP|Ψ(η)) + ˆG(η) ˆQ ˆH(η) ˆP |Ψ(η)) .

(29)

The second term in this equation represents corrections
to ˆP|Ψ(η)) that arise from coupling to the complement
space.

B. Series Expansion

The matrix representation of the Hamiltonian in the
reference space, PH(η)P, can be diagonalized to decou-
ple the reference conﬁgurations. To this end, the complex
symmetric eigenvalue problem

ˆP 2 = ˆP,
ˆQT = ˆQ,

ˆQ2 = ˆQ,
ˆP + ˆQ = ˆ1,

ˆP T = ˆP,
ˆP ˆQ = 0 .

has to be solved. If PH(η)P is diagonalizable [25, 28],
then Q(η) is a complex orthogonal matrix, satisfy-
ing Q(η)Q(η)T = Q(η)TQ(η) = 1.
In this case,
Q(η) allows us to perform a transformation from B =
{|Φj) : j = 1, . . . K} to a more useful orthonormal basis:

In order to solve Eqs. (35) and (37), the matrix G(η) of
the Green’s function ˆG(η), Eq. (26), must be evaluated.
We set H QQ

ˇH(η) = H 0(η) + λ H 1(η) .

The parameter λ is introduced, as in Eq. (19), to al-
low for a systematic perturbation expansion (Sec. IV C).
Employing Eq. (34), the eﬀective Hamiltonian, Eq. (27b),
represented in the new basis, Eq. (31), reads

Condition (41) is, of course, satisﬁed in the limit λ → 0,
in view of Eq. (40). At λ = 1, (41) implies that the series
(43) converges only if the unperturbed energy E(0)
(η) is
well separated from all diagonal elements of QH(η)Q.
This can, in principle, always be enforced by choosing a
suﬃciently large number of references.

The matrix G(η) in Eq. (43) still depends on the exact

Chen et al. have independently derived a formally sim-
ilar theory in Ref. [34], using a direct Taylor series ex-
pansion of the secular equation for the energy of bound
states of a molecular system. They provide explicit ex-
pressions for the perturbation expansion of the real en-
ergy up to third order. Chen et al. further observe that
this kind of multireference approach reduces to single-

reference Epstein-Nesbet perturbation theory if only one
reference is used. Of course, the non-Hermitian multiref-
erence perturbation theory of this section also reduces to
the non-Hermitian single-reference theory.

From the perturbative treatment of Eq. (37) we further

conclude, for k = 1, . . . , n (k 6= j), that

These corrections to the wave function can also be useful
for the real case (η = 0) since they are not explicitly
given in Ref. [34].

In iterative eigenvalue solvers, as for example the Lanc-
zos [54, 55, 56] or the Davidson [57] algorithm, a matrix-
vector multiplication is carried out in each iteration. This
is the slowest step in these algorithms, and it therefore de-
termines their overall performance. The following sketch
of an algorithm for the fourth-order treatment of the
Siegert energy, Eq. (49), reveals that this perturbative
approach is roughly as expensive as a single iteration of
an iterative block-eigenvalue solver.

1. Choose a set of n references. Perform a full diago-
nalization of the complex symmetric matrix repre-
sentation of ˆH(η) in the reference space (Hkl(η),
k, l = 1, . . . , n) to obtain E(0)(η) and Q(η). A
highly eﬃcient program for this purpose is de-
scribed in Ref. [58].

2. Determine all many-particle conﬁgurations, beyond
the reference space, that contribute to the energy
in (49). Since, for electronic-structure problems,
ˆH(η) consists of one- and two-body operators, a
consistent treatment in fourth order requires the
inclusion of single, double, triple, and quadruple
excitations of the references. These excitations
form the complement space and deﬁne, together
with the references, the total vector space dimen-
sion, K. Calculate and store all diagonal matrix
elements of ˆH(η) with respect to the complement
space: dk(η) := Hkk(η), k = n + 1, . . . , K.

The algorithm requires that at least two vectors of the
dimension of the complement space can be held in main
memory. If more memory is available (core memory or
hard disk), at least some of the transformed matrix ele-
ments ˇHjk(η) should also be kept. Otherwise, all of them
have to be recalculated in step 4. The matrix Hkl(η),
k, l = n + 1, . . . , K, in the complement space is in general
much too big to be stored (except for the diagonal ele-
ments dk(η)), so that recalculation is the only practical
option.

For a second-order treatment, the algorithm simpliﬁes
considerably. Only steps 1, 2, 3(a), and the step aﬀecting
E(2)
(η) in 3(b) are needed. The memory requirements
j
are minimal. The second-order perturbation theory can
thus be applied to large systems not amenable to a solu-
tion by an iterative diagonalization procedure.

Note that in second order only single and double exci-
tations of the reference conﬁgurations play a role. This
is also true in third order. In third order, however, in
addition 3(c) and the ﬁrst halves of 4(a) and 4(b) have
to be carried out. Step 4(a) implies the multiplication
of the Hamiltonian matrix in the complement space with
a vector (for each j). This increases the computational
eﬀort signiﬁcantly and is comparable to a single step in
an iterative block diagonalization procedure. As men-
tioned previously, in the fourth-order formalism, triple
and quadruple excitations add a new level of complexity.
Recall that the CAP strength η must be optimized in
order to fulﬁll Eq. (5) for those resonances that can be ap-
proximated well within the reference space. The second-
order approach is exceptionally simple. It should there-
fore be employed to identify potential resonances and to
preoptimize η for each of them. Then, the expensive step
4 can be restricted to a few selected j ∈ {1, . . . , n} and
to a relatively small η range. In this way, the inclusion
of higher-order corrections to the Siegert energies can be
achieved particularly eﬃciently.

V. MODEL PROBLEM

A model problem is studied in this section, which
serves to illustrate the multireference perturbation the-
ory derived in Sec. IV. We consider s-wave scattering of
an electron from the spherically symmetric potential [28]

V (r) =

−V0
V0

(

; 0 ≤ r < a
; a ≤ r < 2a
; r ≥ 2a

.

(53)

E1st = 4.001414397 − 0.003616371 i

(55)

for the ﬁrst resonance, assuming V0 = 10, a = 1.
In the following we employ the CAP operator

ˆW =

(cid:26)

(r − c)2
0

; r ≥ c
; 0 ≤ r < c

.

(56)

The parameter c deﬁnes a sphere about the origin, inside
of which the CAP does not aﬀect the wave function. If c
is too large, with respect to a chosen ﬁnite basis set, then
an outgoing wave will be reﬂected by the basis set wall
and will not be absorbed by the CAP. Conversely, if c is
too small, the perturbation of the wave function near the
origin is too large. A good choice is c = 2a = 2 [28].

The CAP Hamiltonian ˆH(η) of the model problem is
given by Eqs. (2), (54), and (56). The matrix represen-
tation of ˆH(η) is constructed using a basis of particle-in-
a-box functions (k = 1, . . . , K)

φk(r) =

2
L sin
0

kπr
L

(cid:0)

(cid:1)

( q

; 0 ≤ r < L
; r ≥ L

.

(57)

A spatial extension of the basis set of L = 10 is assumed
throughout, which is suﬃciently large compared with c =
2. Furthermore, a basis dimension of K = 5000 is chosen.
A particle-in-a-box function is not a good reference, be-
cause its overall shape diﬀers substantially from that of a
resonance wave function [28]. Hence, the overlap between
the best references and the resonance itself is small. The
matrix representation in the basis (57) therefore has little
similarity with a CI matrix. An improved matrix repre-
sentation of the real Hamiltonian (54) can be created by
diagonalizing the matrix representation of (54) in a ba-
sis of particle-in-a-box functions (57) for a potential well
depth of V0 = 20. The n energetically lowest eigenvectors
in this modiﬁed potential serve as references. The matri-
ces of the real and imaginary parts for V0 = 10 are then
formed with the help of (57) and projected onto the real
eigenbasis calculated with V0 = 20. This procedure yields
matrices that are nearly diagonally dominant, and thus
they bear more resemblance to CI matrices. Especially
the near diagonal dominance of the matrix representation
assures a suﬃcient overlap of the best references with
the ﬁrst resonance of the model problem. Nevertheless,
single-reference perturbation theory is not adequate for
this example.

In order to demonstrate the usefulness of multirefer-
ence perturbation theory in the non-Hermitian case, we
compute the Siegert energy of the ﬁrst resonance in two

FIG. 1: (Color online) The complex Siegert energy of the en-
ergetically lowest resonance in the model potential, Eq. (53),
for an increasing number of references. The resonance energy
is computed (a) by solving the CAP-Schr¨odinger eigenvalue
problem just within the reference space (squares in the ﬁgure)
and (b) by non-Hermitian multireference perturbation theory
up to second order (circles). The real part of the Siegert en-
ergy is shown in the upper panel, the imaginary part in the
lower one. The dotted horizontal lines indicate the exact val-
ues (55).

ways. First, we diagonalize ˆH(η) in the reference space
and employ Eq. (5) without any perturbative correction.
It turns out that in this case more than 20 references are
needed to satisfy the optimization criterion (5). Second,
we apply the second-order scheme, Eq. (49a). The results
are compared in Fig. 1, as a function of the number of ref-
erences, n. The real and imaginary parts of the computed
Siegert energy are shown separately. The dotted horizon-
tal lines in the ﬁgure indicate the exact values (55). It is
evident that the convergence of the Siegert energy with
increasing n can be accelerated considerably by the ap-
plication of perturbation theory. Not only is it possible,
in the second-order approach, to satisfy Eq. (5) with a
relatively small number of references, the accuracy at a
given n is also signiﬁcantly improved.

In this example, the application of multireference per-
turbation theory takes about 80 s for 40 references and
70 steps with varying η. Carrying out a full diagonaliza-
tion for 70 diﬀerent η values takes approximately 20 d on
the same computer.

VI. CONCLUSION

9

Non-Hermitian Rayleigh-Schr¨odinger perturbation
theories, based on Epstein-Nesbet partitioning, have
been devised and examined in this article. The single-
and the multireference theory are interesting tools for
investigating the decay properties of resonance states—
which represent the most conspicuous manifestation of
quantum eﬀects in scattering processes. Use of a complex
absorbing potential is made in order to transform the
time-dependent decay problem into a non-Hermitian,
time-independent, bound-state-like problem that can be
treated with L2 techniques.

In a complete basis set, the single-reference pertur-
bation theory turns out to lead to equations identical
to those obtained in the framework of Wigner-Weisskopf
theory. However, the non-Hermitian theory oﬀers com-
putational advantages that should be exploited.

Flexibility can be added by using more than one refer-
ence. We have developed the non-Hermitian multirefer-
ence perturbation theory through fourth order with re-
spect to the energy and through second order for the wave
function. The application to a model problem illustrates
the eﬃciency and accuracy of the method.

The integration of non-Hermitian perturbation theory
into existing ab initio programs for solving the electronic-
structure problem in ﬁnite systems is straightforward
and is presently carried out utilizing the multireference
conﬁguration-interaction program diesel [59, 60, 61].
The matrix elements of the CAP operator can be ob-
tained eﬃciently [29], with only minor modiﬁcation of the
diesel program. The second-order non-Hermitian mul-
tireference perturbation theory, in particular, may open
the door to a theoretical understanding of electronic res-
onance physics in large molecular systems.

A fermion ground state energy functional is set up in terms of particle density, relative pair density,
and kinetic energy tensor density. It satisﬁes a minimum principle if constrained by a complete set
of compatibility conditions. A partial set, which thereby results in a lower bound energy under
minimization, is obtained from the solution of model systems, as well as a small number of exact
sum rules. Prototypical application is made to several one-dimensional spinless non-interacting
models. The eﬀectiveness of “atomic” constraints on model “molecules” is observed, as well as the
structure of systems with only ﬁnitely many bound states.

INTRODUCTION

ate constructs, and produce as output, the same quantity,
the fermion (electron) density

The ground state properties of many-fermion systems,
even with the implied restrictions on temperature do-
main, stationarity, homogeneity of particle type, have a
physical importance that can hardly be overestimated.
This has spawned a large variety of approximative, and
in principle exact analytical and numerical solution tech-
niques. There are also, in practice, conceptual restric-
tions on such techniques. They should not supply appre-
ciably more information (which costs more as well) than
one can conceivably use, but the intermediate constructs
employed should be suﬃciently nuanced that qualita-
tive distinction between distinct systems can emerge, and
“physical intuition” utilized and developed along the way.
One “traditional” basically analytical direction that
has been, and is being, pursued intensively is based upon
the Rayleigh - Ritz variational principle. It is extreme
in both aspects alluded to above: the intermediate con-
struct used is the full N -body trial wave function ψN , and
the exactly bounded information obtained is the ground
state energy E0 alone:

E0 ≤ hψN | ˆHN |ψN i ;

(1)

here, HN denotes the system Hamiltonian. To be sure,
bounding principles for expectations are also available
but are much more conservative, the ground state restric-
tion is trivially weakened to include ground state condi-
tioned by compatible constants of the motion, and highly
accurate ground state energy engenders conﬁdence that
expectations using the computed wave function will be
highly reliable. And of course, the generality of this ap-
proach makes application to multi-species systems quite
direct, but also very computation-intensive.

As it has become necessary to deal with increasingly
complex structures, the electronic component of a Born -
Oppenheimer macromolecule being an outstanding ex-
ample, density functional techniques have emerged as
very powerful semi-analytic tools. They use as intermedi-

and attend to the spin population as well, but all depend
upon intelligent semi-empirical information as to the de-
pendence of the energy on this quantity, corresponding to
a bounding principle of not much more than pictorial sig-
niﬁcance. In practice, even primitive local density func-
tionals often give tolerable results, and density gradient
extensions [1] can, in professional hands, be remarkably
eﬀective, as well as be generalizable to to non-ground
states and dynamical information.

An elusive goal for many years has been the estab-
lishment of practical analytical techniques which work
through not much more than the needed output informa-
tion and yet are also exact bounding principles at some
level. The modiﬁer “practical” is where the diﬃculty
lies. The version that has been pursued even longer than
density functional techniques is that involving only the
ground state 2-body reduced density matrix

Then one has, in obvious notation,

where K = T + v .

But the reduction of an N -body system to the de-
tailed properties of an eﬀective 2-body system involves a
tremendous reduction of information, which must there-
fore be supplied indirectly [2].
In the version referred
to, these take the form of a small selection of known
sum rules, and a large implicit, but only partially known,
selection of inequalities that the 2 body density matrix
must satisfy. It is only with the advent of modern com-
putational tools - hardware and algorithms - that this
approach has become feasible, but still primarily in the
area of small systems and coarsely discretized function
space.

In the present paper, we study an oﬀshoot of this last
activity, initially restricted to the very large domain of
systems that can be modeled by having Newtonian ki-
netic energy

establishing the basic sum rules and the model-generated
form of inequalities. As will be reported in work now
in progress, extension to 3 dimensions and spin is quite
direct,
if a bit more complicted, whereas the explicit
inclusion of interaction requires a simple but non-trivial
expansion of the technique (not even needed if only
the construction of the Kohn-Sham pseudo-one-body
density matrix [3] is at issue). In particular, the required
amassing of model reference systems is more intricate,
and will be reported on in a later publication;
see
however Section V. In Sec III, we apply the technique
to a few very elementary examples, and indicate in Sec
IV how the strict minimization can be relaxed. Sec V
tests to what extent toy “molecules” can be solved via
knowledge of their component “atoms”, and in Sec VI,
we study the much more demanding situation in which
only a ﬁnite number of non-interacting bound state
exists.

IMPLICIT DENSITY FUNCTIONAL
INEQUALITY TAKEN AS CONSTRAINT

Since one knows, e.g.

from the work of Hohenberg
and Kohn [4], that one can use the N -electron density
function ρN (x) as the only variable when interaction and
external potentials u and v are ﬁxed, let us rewrite Eq.(6)
as

T (p) = p2/2m

E0 = min

T [ρN ] +

ρN (x)v(x)dx + Uint[ρN ]

, (8)

(7)

ρN (cid:26)

(cid:27)

as the only momentum - dependent contribution. The in-
termediate quantities we deal with are various one-point
densities, particle density (2) as well as suitably deﬁned
kinetic energy tensor density and pair interacting density
(The pair distribution integrated over center of mass).
These are minimally informative, but suﬃcient to repre-
sent major quantities of physical interest - including the
energy, thereby allowing an energy bounding principle to
be formulated. The reduction in information is even more
extreme than in the pair-density matrix formulation, and
so even more subsidiary restrictions must be imposed.
But we will see that they can be selected by attention
to the underlying physics, and then are rewardingly ef-
fective. This means that we will take great advantage
of simple physical systems that share physical charac-
teristics with the system at hand. An important tool
will stem from the observation that any solvable model –
each of which is associated with an inequality restriction
– expands to a whole class of models under coordinate
transformations.

In our current entree to this approach, we will conﬁne
our attention to very primitive “toy” models, selected
to probe the eﬀectiveness of the technique without
undue complexity. Thus, starting in Sec II, we deal only
with one-dimensional non-interacting spinless fermions,

where T [ρN ] is the kinetic energy part and Uint[ρN ]
the interacting part of the energy expectation. The in-
principle separation into T [ρN ] + Uint[ρN ] is a conse-
quence of the fact that ρN determines v and hence the
full wave function ψN as well; T [ρN ] is not identical to
the adiabatically interactionless kinetic energy relevant
to Kohn-Sham.

Therefore, the ground state can be obtained by apply-
ing a variational principle to the expected value of energy
with respect to the density function ρN (x), provided that
the full functional of density is known. In most cases, the
exact form of the functional is impossible to write down
explicitly. And as we will emphasize in this paper, it’s
also unnecessary to do so since the functional is implied
by suﬃcient many equalities or inequalities, several of
which we apply as constraints on the minimization.

Consider a one dimensional non-interacting N -fermion
reference system on coordinate space {X}, the ground
state energy EN of which is known and must satisfy

hψN | ˆHN |ψN i ≥ EN ,

(9)

where ˆHN =
i + V ( ˆXi)), and ψN is any anti-
ˆP 2

nience is that each solved reference generates a whole

class of useful references, as follows: A continuous trans-
formation of coordinates Xi = f (xi) can always be ex-
tended to a unitary tranformation[5] by setting

as ˆT (x):

Pi =

g(xi)pi + pig(xi)
2

,

(10)

where g(x) = 1/J(x) and J(x) = f ′(x) is the trans-
formation Jacobian. Hence the commutator relation
[xi, pj] = i~δij persists, and a new set of canonical coor-
dinates {xi, pi} is obtained. Deﬁne the symmetric kinetic
energy density operator(which becomes a tensor density
in higher dimensional space) as

ˆt(x) =

(δ(x − ˆxi)ˆpi ˆpi + 2ˆpiδ(x − ˆxi)ˆpi

(15)

Moreover, v(x) = V (X) and ρv is transformed from the
original density function as ρv(x) = ρV (X)J(x).

Therefore, for any realizable, i.e. “N -representable”
combination of kinetic energy density t(x) and density
ρ(x), we must have

ˆT (X) =

Eq.(11) is not a unique representation of kinetic energy
density, since we can add any spatial divergence to it
and yield the same total energy. For example, one has

Both lead to the same total kinetic energy but the ki-
netic energy density is diﬀerent. For a non-interacting
fermion system with harmonic oscillator external poten-
tial well, the three types of kinetic energy densities men-
tioned above are shown in Figure 1. Compared to the
other two, the shell details of the fully symmetrized ki-
netic energy density are diminished. The advantage of
picking up the symmetric one is that it gives a relative
simpler form of the coordinate transform for kinetic en-
ergy.

Applying the symmetrized kinetic energy density def-
inition (11), we have for the energy expectation for the

due to the (g′)2 term always turns out to be very small
- for an exception, see Eq.(32)). Minimizing the left-

The ordinary diﬀerential equation(ODE) array above
won’t challenge numerical calculations at all. However,
in order to present the constraint Eq.(23) concretely, let’s
consider a reference system with a linear external poten-

III. PRIMITIVE APPLICATIONS

Due to the last nonlinear term on the left-hand-side in
the constraint Eq.(17), it can not easily be simpliﬁed. As
to its positivity, by making the constraint a bit stronger,
we can eliminate this term so that the feasibility of the

which is clearly false because EC [ρN ] → - const as

the neglected (g′)2 term, which is ordinarily very small,
but when it is required to map a density due to a reg-
ular potential onto one from a singular potential, this
is no longer the case, and the inclusion of (g′)2 could
be mandatory. We have taken the γ = −1 case as a
ﬁrst example to show that the reference system must be
reasonably similar to the system under study to make

now consider further examples that develop this implicit

IV. DENSITY CONFIGURATION
CONCENTRATION

For any N -representable density proﬁle ρ(x), there al-
ways exist scale transformed density functions ρα(x) ≡
αρ(αx) so that using virial constraint (22) the applied
reference dependent constraint is satisﬁed. Among these
transformed densities, we have a uniquely deﬁned refer-
ence dependent density functional

ERef[ρ] ≡

(37)

,

Z

(cid:19)

where KEDHV is the kinetic energy density term with
the local hyper-virial constraint (21) applied. Therefore,
a pseudo energy landscape (PEL) of the density proﬁle is
obtained, the global minimum of which provides a lower
bound to the energy expectation of the ground state. It is
noticed that because of making use of the scale transform,
the landscape ERef[ρ] depends only on the scale free
conﬁguration of the density proﬁle. Rather than search-
ing the minimum over the entire non-negative density
function space, one can obtain the identical minimum by
searching within a more compact subspace provided that
every conﬁguration of density has been included. There-
fore, the reference dependent landscape is furthermore
reduced to the density conﬁguration hypersurface. The
minimization task can be achieved by searching the mini-
mum over the randomly generated n dimensional discrete
density proﬁle subspace (100000 conﬁgurations were typ-
ically used ) as

ρ0 ⊗ ρ1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ ρn−1 ∼ 0 ⊗ Rand(m) ⊗ · · · ⊗ Rand(m)

⊗0

n−2

|

{z

(38)
}
where both n and m are positive integers and Rand(m)
randomly generates an integer between 0 to m−1. ρ0 and
ρn−1 are zero since the density vanishes at both ends in
one dimensional space. The entire conﬁguration hyper-
surface is covered as n and m approach inﬁnity. To avoid
the unnecessary computing eﬀort in searching within the
unsmooth function space, a smooth density function sub-
space can be obtained by interpolating the randomly gen-

erated control points with splines. Therefore, for prac-
tical use, ﬁnite number of random numbers is required
to generate a density proﬁle. In this paper, for random
generated density proﬁles, a B-spline [10] of degree 3 is
applied.

As shown in Figure 2, the control points can be ei-
ther equally spaced or randomly spaced to include more
rapidly varying density conﬁgurations with the same
number of control points. This is useful when, as in this
introductory study, we want to economize on the resolu-
tion employed.

The lower bound of the ground state energy is given

by

EL =

min
ρ1,ρ2,···ρn−1

ERef [ρ = spline (ρ1, ρ2, · · · ρn−1)]

(39)
According to the deﬁnition of the landscape ERef, if
one were to take reference system with external poten-
tial identical to that of the target system, it’s trivial that
the reference dependent landscape ERef[ρ] = Eexact,
where Eexact is the ground state energy of the target
system, which is ﬂat all over the density conﬁguration
hypersurface. Therefore, any landscapes tangential to it
have the landscape altitudes concentrating near the ex-
act ground state energy, which is a saddle point. Note
that for a reference system very diﬀerent from the tar-
get system, there’s only one crosspoint in the density
conﬁguration hypersurface between the reference depen-
dent landscape and the ﬂat landscape described above.
It can be concluded that the distribution function of
ERef has its maximum at the ground state energy of
the target system, provided none of the density conﬁg-
urations dominate when generating the density proﬁles
randomly, as illuminated by Figure 3. Consequently, the
randomly generated density conﬁgurations provides not
only a lower bound but also practical approximation to
the target system.

V. MOLECULE-LIKE SYSTEMS

In our primitive application of the energy minimizing
scheme, we have shown that coordinate-transformations
from a known reference system do provide a somewhat
weak lower bound for the ground state energy level of
a fairly diﬀerent system, too. We are also interested in
applying the constraint to a locally similar but globally
diﬀerent target system . Let’s see what would happen if
we convert a single well reference system into a molecule
with double core.

For example, let’s consider the fermion system to be
solved as having the double linear well as external poten-

taking the asymptotic constraint, one can make use of the
exact energy level of N non-interacting fermions within
the linear well. The pseudo energy landscape is generated
with the ERef associate with the random density proﬁles,

as a lower bound.

On observing the energy landscape concentration as
shown before, we ﬁnd the most probable energy levels,
which can also be compared with the exact ground state
energy level of the double linear well system. As shown in
Table II, the most probable energy levels give the best ap-
proximation. With N increasing, the minimization with
single well constraint alone gives a closer result than the
Thomas-Fermi approximation.

The potnetial consequence of the quite decent agree-
ment at this preliminary level are far - reaching: the
same strategy can be used for full interacting atoms in
molecules, a situation in which universally useful model
systems are few in number.

VI. MORE THAN SINGLE CONSTRAINT AND
SHIELDED COULOMB POTENTIAL

As stated above, since the density conﬁguration for the
system to be solved should agree with every reference sys-
tem provided, the more constraints we apply, the better
the result one would expect. Therefore, we would like to
constrain the target system by two reference systems to
see how the lower energy bound is improved.

Among all the density functions which satisfy the con-
straints, we are interested in those that generate the low-
est energy levels together with the assistance of the local
hyper-virial theorem. These energy levels are used to

which the density conﬁgurations concentrate with a single well

by subjecting the minimization to the single well constraint,
serving as lower bound. The ﬁfth column provides the result

provide a lower energy bound. The B-splines generated
by random numbers are still used as the density conﬁgu-
ration candidates.

We will see that not all pairs of constraints are eﬀective
in providing a decent lower energy bound for the target
system. Not surprisingly, only those pairs of constraints
that bracket the target system are really eﬀective.

Note that only the constraints from the reference sys-
tem with external potential v(x) ∼ x can be written down
explicitly, while the others we can make use of so far can
only be applied numerically. A primitive test of the eﬀect
of the double constraint is by making use of the asymp-
totic behavior of the constraints when the number of par-
ticles is suﬃciently large, and comparing the result with
those obtained from Thomas-Fermi approximation. The
latter is believed to be a good approximation to describe
the energy levels for the non-interacting fermion system
when the number of fermion is large enough, except for
those with Coulomb potential as external potential.

The target system we will test has external potential in
the form v(x) = xγ
γ . Pairs of constraints that can bracket
the target system and those that can not are selected to
generate the lower energy bounds for the target system.
The results are shown in Table III. We see that the re-
sult doesn’t improve much compared with those obtained
from the single constraint unless the pair of references
system can bracket this system. The role of “bracketing”
is overwhelmingly important.

As discussed above, we have shown that our continu-
ous coordinate transform scheme works well with most

It will be interesting to know if it will break
down when the system has ﬁnitely many bound states.
One such N -fermion system that was the focus of past
study is the shielded Coulomb system[11] with the exter-
nal potential v(x) = − e
, which can only be numer-
ically solved [12]. It’s known to have a ﬁnite number of
bound energy levels due to the eﬀect of screening, and the
number of bound energy levels depends on the screening
length D.

The pair of reference systems we use here are Coulomb
and harmonic oscillator systems. And the exact value of
each energy level is applied for each reference system.
For half space 1-D Coulomb systems, the ground state
energy level for N fermions is proportional to H(N, 2) ≡
1
n2 , where H(x, 2) is the harmonic number function
of x with order 2. And the ground state energy level
P
for N fermions within a half space 1-D harmonic well is
proportional to N (N + 1

2 ).

The results with random density conﬁguration candi-
dates are shown in Table IV. We do have ﬁnite num-
ber of bound states with this pair of constraints, even
though the reference systems that we apply have an in-
ﬁnite number of bound states. Only when the screening
length arrives at some threshold length, can a new bound
state survive from the double constraints.

shielded Coulomb potential. The number to the left of each
cell is the lower bound obtained with double constraints. The
number to the right is the energy level obtained with numer-
ical calculation.

VII. CONCLUSION

We have seen that the analysis of a many-fermion
ground state can be recast as a constrained minimiza-
tion of a functional of two scalar and one tensor ﬁeld. For
non-interacting fermions, only the density and a suitably

9

deﬁned kinetic energy tensor density are required, and
the eﬀort is shifted to tabulating and using the needed
constraints, which can be tuned to emphasize known and
hypothesized physical aspects of the system. Taking the
one-dimensional spinless system as prototype, a class of
inequalities based upon solvable models has been devel-
oped, as well as the hypervirial equality. With only a
small number of solvable models to help us, quite de-
cent results have been obtained for some simple systems,
including mock “molecular” ones and systems with a con-
trolled number of bound states. Extension of these tech-
niques to 3 dimensions, and to the spin degree of free-
dom, is direct, and will be reported in the near future.
Extension to physical interaction is less direct, and sev-
eral paths are under study, which will be reported as well.
They include universal bounds on the interaction energy
as a functional of ρ and t (see ref[5] for a rudimentary ex-
ample), and modiﬁcation of the coordinate transforma-
tion tactic in the face of interactions. It must of course
be emphasized that this continuing investigation is not to
be regarded as competition to the array of high accuracy
computational techniques that have been developed, but
rather as a low-cost replacement when ﬁne detail is not
required.

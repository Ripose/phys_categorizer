Abstract

A benchmark ab initio study on the thermochemistry of the trans-HNNH, cis-

HNNH, and H2NN isomers of diazene has been carried out using the CCSD(T)

coupled cluster method, basis sets as large as [7s6p5d4f 3g2h/5s4p3d2f 1g],

and extrapolations towards the 1-particle basis set limit. The eﬀects on inner-

shell correlation and of anharmonicity in the zero-point energy were taken

into account: accurate geometries and anharmonic force ﬁelds were thus ob-

tained as by-products. Our best computed ∆H ◦

f,0 for trans-HNNH, 49.2±0.3

kcal/mol, is in very good agreement with a recent experimental lower limit

of 48.8±0.5 kcal/mol. CCSD(T) basis set limit values for the isomerization

energies at 0 K are 5.2±0.2 kcal/mol (cis-trans) and 24.1±0.2 kcal/mol (iso-

trans). Our best computed geometry for trans-HNNH, re(NN)=1.2468 ˚A,

1

re(NH)=1.0283 ˚A, and θe=106.17◦, reproduces the precisely known ground-

state rotational constants of trans-HNNH to within better than 0.1 %. The

rotation-vibration spectra of both cis-HNNH and H2NN are dominated by

very strong Coriolis and Fermi resonances. In addition, the NH stretches in

H2NN are so strongly anharmonic that vibrational perturbation theory breaks

down, and the molecule appears to be an excellent test case for variational

treatments of the vibrational Schr¨odinger equation.

I. INTRODUCTION

The existence of N2H2 (diazene, diimide) was suggested as early as 1892 [1] as an inter-

mediate in the decomposition of azoformic acid. The trans isomer was ﬁnally discovered in

1958 by mass spectrometry as a gaseous discharge product of hydrazine [2], and around the

same time in the infrared as a photolysis product of matrix isolated hydrazoic acid [3,4]. The

compound is of importance in organic chemistry for the stereospeciﬁc reduction of oleﬁns [5]

and of course as the parent of a large number of azo compounds, and in inorganic chemistry

as a ligand for transition metal complexes [6]. For comprehensive (if somewhat older) reviews

on the preparation, properties, and reactions of diimide, the reader is referred to Back [7]

and to a volume [8] in the Patai series on the chemistry of functional groups.

Early work on its rotation-vibration spectroscopy was reviewed by Craig and Levin

[9] (CL). Its anharmonic force ﬁeld was studied ab initio at the MP2/[4s3p2d1f ] and

CCSD/[3s2p1d]

levels by Kobayashi, Bl´udsky, Koch, and Jørgenson (KBKJ) [10] —

who also considered the cis-diazene and isodiazene isomers — and very recently at the

CCSD(T)/[4s3p2d1f ] level by the present authors (MT) [11], who also reviewed more recent

spectroscopic information. After publication of this latter paper, Demaison, Hegelund, and

B¨urger (DHB) [12] published new experimentally derived equilibrium geometry data, based

in part on a re-analysis of recent high-resolution data for trans-HNNH [13], trans-DNND

[14], and trans-HNND [15].

2

Experimental information on the cis isomer is quite limited, basically consisting of tenta-

tive assignments of bands at 3074 and 1279 cm−1 by Rosengren and Pimentel (RP) [4] and

of bands at 1034, 1347, 3025, and 3116 cm−1 by Wiberg, Fisher, and Bachhuber (WFB) [16].

CL also derived estimated harmonic frequencies from an empirical force ﬁeld based on the

trans-HNNH frequencies. In light of the fact that some of these frequencies were misassigned

[11] and that various force constants had to be neglected for want of suﬃcient experimental

data, these frequencies are of limited reliability.

The isodiazene isomer was predicted about a century ago to play a key role as an inter-

mediate in the chemistry of azo compounds [17]. Following earlier reporting of the synthesis

of the substituted isodiazene (2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidyl)nitrene [18], isolation and charac-

terization by low-temperature matrix infrared spectroscopy was reported by Sylwester and

Derwan (SD) [19]. Teles et al. (TMHS) [20] obtained isodiazene by photolysis of amino-

isocyanates in argon at 12 K, and recorded a complete infrared spectrum which they assigned

with the help of fairly low-level ab initio harmonic frequency calculations. Finally, Gold-

berg et al. [21] reported mass spectrometric detection of isodiazene and its cation in the gas

phase. These authors also carried out G2 level calculations on the relative energies of various

minima and transition states on the N2H2 potential surface, as did Smith [22].

Ab initio (e.g. [23–25,21,26]) and density functional (e.g. [27,28]) calculations on the

relative stability of the trans-diazene, cis-diazene, and isodiazene isomers have consistently

shown a stability ordering trans > cis > iso, as well as high (in excess of 40 kcal/mol)

isomerization barriers between the isomers. (Very recently, the rigid cis-trans rotation of

the molecule was proposed and studied [29] as a test case for a new multireference coupled

cluster method [29], the transition state being a ‘real-life’ alternative for H4 as an essentially

perfect two-conﬁguration reference problem.)

The heat of formation of trans-HNNH is not very well established. The original pa-

per by Foner and Hudson reports a mass spectrometric ∆H ◦

f,0=52.4±2.0 kcal/mol. By

photoionization mass spectrometry, Rusci´c and Berkowitz [30] established a lower limit,

∆H ◦

f,0 ≥ 46.6 ± 0.8 kcal/mol, which is consistent with a calculated value using the G2 model

3

[31] by Pople and Curtiss [25], 49.6 kcal/mol. The gap between theoretical value and ex-

perimental upper limit was narrowed by new vacuum UV photolysis experiments by Biehl

and Stuhl (BS) [32] who obtained ∆H ◦

f,0 ≥ 48.8 ± 0.5 kcal/mol. Clearly, the availability of

a benchmark ab initio value would be highly desirable.

We have recently developed basis set extrapolation techniques [33,34] which permit the

calculation of molecular total atomization energies (TAEe at the bottom of the well, TAE0

at 0 K) with a mean absolute error as low as 0.12 kcal/mol. Using this technique, we

were recently able [35] to resolve a long-standing controversy concerning the heat of for-

mation of B(g). One objective of the present work is to obtain a benchmark heat of for-

mation of trans-HNNH, as well as benchmark values for the isomerization energies in the

{trans,cis,iso}diazene system.

As by-products of these calculations (which require inclusion of inner-shell correlation and

of anharmonic contributions to the total atomization energy) we will also present accurate

computed geometries and anharmonic force ﬁelds, although the latter are not the primary

focus of the present work.

II. METHODS

All electronic structure calculations were carried out using the MOLPRO 96.4 [36] quan-

tum chemistry package running on DEC Alpha 500/500 and SGI Origin 2000 computers at

the Weizmann Institute, and on the Cray C90 at San Diego Supercomputer Center.

The CCSD(T) electron correlation method [37,38], as implemented by Hampel et al. [39],

has been used throughout. (For the atomic calculations involved in the TAE determinations,

the deﬁnition of the restricted open-shell CCSD(T) energy according to Ref. [38] is used.)

The acronym stands for coupled cluster with all single and double substitutions [40] aug-

mented by a quasiperturbative account for triple excitations [37]. From extensive studies

(see [41] for a review) this method is known to yield correlation energies very close to the

exact n-particle solution within the given basis set as long as the Hartree-Fock determinant

4

is a reasonably good zero-order reference wave function. The T1 diagnostic, proposed [42] as

a measure of the importance of nondynamical correlation, was found to be 0.017 and 0.018,

respectively, for trans-HNNH and cis-HNNH: these values suggest a wavefunction dominated

by a single reference determinant. The computed T1 for isodiazene, 0.030, suggests a mild

degree of nondynamical correlation which experience suggests [41] is still well within the

range of applicability for CCSD(T).

Calculations including only valence correlation were carried out using the cc-pVnZ and

aug′-cc-pVnZ (n=D, T, Q, 5) basis sets of Dunning and coworkers [43,44]. The highest angu-

lar momenta present in these basis sets are {d,f,g,h} in the series {D,T,Q,5}. The augmented

correlation consistent (aug-cc-pVnZ) basis sets diﬀer from the parent cc-pVnZ basis set by

the addition of one diﬀuse (anion) function for each angular momentum. It was previously

established that such basis functions are essential for accurate computed bond angles [45]

and atomization energies [33,46] of strongly polar molecules. The aug′-cc-pVnZ notation [47]

stands for the combination of a regular cc-pVnZ basis set on hydrogen with an aug-cc-pVnZ

basis set on ﬁrst-row atoms. We previously found [33] that this aﬀects computed atomiza-

tion energies by less than 0.1 kcal/mol. In the interest of brevity, the standard acronyms

cc-pVnZ and aug′-cc-pVnZ will be replaced by VnZ and A′VnZ, respectively.

The eﬀect of inner-shell correlation was assessed by taking the diﬀerence between

CCSD(T) calculations with and without constraining the inner-shell orbitals to be dou-

bly occupied. Inner-shell correlation requires suﬃcient ﬂexibility of the s basis set in the

high-exponent region as well as the presence of high-exponent p, d, and f functions.

In

the present work, we have employed the Martin-Taylor core correlation basis set [45], which

was previously found [48] to recover essentially the entire diﬀerential eﬀect of inner-shell

correlation for ﬁrst-row molecules.

Geometry optimizations were carried out by repeated multivariate parabolic interpolation

with a step size of 0.001 a0 or radian, and a convergence threshold of about 10−5 a0 or radian.

Quartic force ﬁelds were set up by ﬁnite diﬀerentiation in symmetry-adapted coordinates.

In order to keep higher-order contamination in the quartic portion of the force ﬁeld to

5

a minimum, fairly small step sizes 0.01 ˚A and radian were used and CCSD(T) energies

converged to essentially machine precision. Generation of the displaced Cartesian geometries

and transformation of the internal coordinate force ﬁeld to Cartesian coordinates were carried

out with the help of the INTDER [49] program. The anharmonic spectroscopic analysis

was carried out by standard second-order rovibrational perturbation theory [50,51] using a

modiﬁed version of SPECTRO [52,53]. Cubic and quartic resonances were accounted for

using the method previously described in MT, as implemented by one of us [54].

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

A. Thermochemistry

All relevant data can be found in Table I. In this molecule, the SCF and valence corre-

lation contributions to the total atomization energy (TAE) are clearly equally important.

Using the cc-pVnZ basis sets, basis set convergence for the SCF contribution is atypically

slow: enlarging the basis set from cc-pVTZ to cc-pVQZ aﬀects all three TAE values by

around 2 kcal/mol, while further basis set expansion to cc-pV5Z still contributes another 0.5

kcal/mol, on average. By contrast, convergence in the aug′-cc-pVnZ series is considerably

faster: improving the basis set from aug′-cc-pVTZ to aug′-cc-pVQZ increases TAE by only

about 1 kcal/mol, while further enlargement to aug′-cc-pV5Z aﬀects all values by only 0.1–0.2

kcal/mol. It is also worth noting that the SCF/cc-pVDZ and SCF/aug′-cc-pVDZ TAE values

diﬀer by 5–5.5 kcal/mol. These observations clearly demonstrates that diﬀuse functions on

N are essential for a balanced description of these species.

For the sake of elegance, an extrapolation to the one-particle basis set limit is required.

We have considered two alternatives: an A+ B/(l + 1/2)5 extrapolation following the sugges-

tion of Petersson et al. [55] and Ref. [34], and the geometric extrapolation formula originally

proposed by Feller [56]. The extrapolated limits from the VnZ and A′VnZ series diﬀer

appreciably with the former formula: the latter yields essentially identical results for both

molecules.

In order to clarify this matter further, we have considered extrapolated total

6

SCF energies for a number of systems for which numerical Hartree-Fock limits are available.

These data are given in Table II. It is clearly seen that the geometric formula most closely

reproduces the numerical SCF energies, although the value of an extrapolation with basis

sets as large as those considered here is largely cosmetic.

Following the pioneering work by Schwartz [57], Hill [58] and Kutzelnigg and Morgan

[59] showed that the basis set convergence of pair correlation energies can be expanded as

an asymptotic series in 1/(l + 1/2), with l the highest angular momentum appearing in the

basis set. Based hereon, Martin [33] proposed the use of a 3-point extrapolation formula

of the form A + B/(l + 1/2)C. In combination with appropriate SCF extrapolations and

accounts for inner-shell correlation, the present authors [34] found that the very precisely

known experimental TAEs of 15 small polyatomic molecules could be reproduced to within

0.12 kcal/mol.

In the present case, the A′VnZ basis sets systematically recover a slightly larger percent-

age of the correlation energy than their VnZ counterparts: however, the diﬀerences are much

smaller than for the SCF portion of TAE. As we previously found [33,46,34] for molecules

with polar bonds, the extrapolated values based on VnZ calculations are substantially higher

(about 0.6 kcal/mol in this case) than those obtained from A′VnZ results. Relative to the

CCSD(T)/A′V5Z result, the extrapolation accounts for 1.5–1.7 kcal/mol.

It is perhaps worth mentioning that the convergence of the sum of SCF and correlation

energies for relatively small basis sets would be dominated to a substantial extent by the

SCF convergence behavior, and leads to the erroneous conclusion that overall convergence

behavior is best described by an exponential series.

Inner-shell correlation contributes 0.91, 0.87, and 1.04 kcal/mol, respectively, for the

trans-, cis-, and isodiazene isomers. It thus leaves the cis-trans equilibrium fundamentally

unchanged but does favor the isodiazene isomer somewhat compared to the other two isomers.

For the ‘bottom-of-the-well’ situation, our best calculations thus predict a cis-trans iso-

merization energy of 5.59 kcal/mol and an iso-trans diﬀerence of 24.95 kcal/mol. Inclusion

of CCSD(T)/cc-pVQZ anharmonic zero-point energies considerably aﬀects these values, fa-

7

voring cis over trans by 0.38 kcal/mol and isodiazene over trans-diazene by 0.83 kcal/mol.

Our ﬁnal best isomerization energies at 0 K are then 5.21 kcal/mol (cis-trans) and 24.12

kcal/mol (iso-trans), which we estimate to be accurate to about 0.1 kcal/mol. The G2

values of Goldberg et al., 5.0 and 24.1 kcal/mol, are in excellent agreement with our values.

Combining our computed TAE0 of 278.76 kcal/mol for the trans form with the JANAF

heats of formation of N(g) and H(g), we obtain a computed CCSD(T) basis set limit

∆H 0

f,0(trans-HNNH)=49.57 kcal/mol, to which we assign a conservative error bar of ±0.2

kcal/mol. The G2 value of 49.6 kcal/mol [25] is in perfect agreement with our calibration

calculation. The most recent experimental value is a lower limit of 48.8 ± 0.5 kcal/mol by

Biehl and Stuhl [32], which is quite consistent with our calculations.

A litmus test for basis set convergence of our computed value would be if a 3-point

extrapolation from AVQZ, AV5Z, and AV6Z were to yield the same result as above

(AVTZ,AVQZ,AV5Z). While a CCSD(T)/AV6Z calculation on trans-HNNH is beyond our

computational resources, we can certainly carry out such calculations for the prototype

systems N2 and NH. For these systems, we ﬁnd diﬀerences of -0.13 and -0.045 kcal/mol,

respectively, adding up for HNNH to an estimated diﬀerence of only -0.04 kcal/mol. We can

therefore assume that our result is converged with respect to the 1-particle basis set.

The remaining discrepancy with experiment for N2, then, appears to be to some extent

due to imperfections in the CCSD(T) treatment. Because their magnitude in trans-HNNH

is somewhat hard to quantify, we aﬃx an overall error bar of about 0.5 kcal/mol to our

computed TAEe.

In Ref. [34], it was proposed to add a correction term of 0.126 kcal/mol per bond order

involving at least one N atom, which greatly improved agreement with experiment for such

compounds as N2, NH3, NNO, and HNO. If the same were done here, this would lead to

an increase of 0.504 kcal/mol in the computed TAE0 to 279.26 kcal/mol, and a decrease in

the computed ∆H ◦

f,0 to 49.07 kcal/mol, which is within the error bar of the Biehl and Stuhl

lower limit.

Alternatively, we may use the 3-parameter empirical correction due to Martin [60,46]

8

∆Ecorrection = aσnσ + bπnπ + (nσ + nπ + nlone pair)cpair

(1)

in which nσ, nπ, nlone pair represent the numbers of σ bonds, π bonds, and lone pairs, re-
spectively, and the coeﬃcients aσ, bπ, cpair are speciﬁc for the basis set, electron correlation

treatment, and (level of theory used for the) reference geometry. (They are determined by

least-squares ﬁtting to a fairly small sample of very accurately known TAEs.) Ref. [46] lists

two sets of parameters, one which only attempts to correct for basis set incompleteness in

the valence correlation treatment (the inner-shell correlation contribution being computed

explicitly), and another which attempts to absorb the inner-shell correlation contribution

in the parametrization. In the present case, as seen in Table III, the ‘implicit core corre-

lation’ set of parameters yields essentially identical results to the set of parameters with

explicit inclusion of core correlation. The 3-parameter corrected values converge surprisingly

rapidly as a function of basis set (Table III): from VTZ to A′V5Z, the variation is no larger

than about 0.15 kcal/mol. The highest-level value, A′V5Z with explicit core correlation,

is TAEe=296.5 kcal/mol, or TAE0=279.0 kcal/mol, that is ∆H ◦

f,0=49.37 kcal/mol. (The

mean absolute error for the “training set” in Ref. [46] is 0.20 kcal/mol at this level.) Taking

the average between the extrapolated and empirically corrected values and using twice the

diﬀerence between the values as an estimated error bar, we ﬁnally suggest ∆H ◦

f,0=49.2±0.3

kcal/mol as our best estimate for the heat of formation of trans-diazene.

As expected, basis set convergence for the cis-trans and iso-trans isomerization energies

is quite fast, and there is no reason why our computed basis set limits should not be accurate

to as little as 0.1 kcal/mol: we will conservatively double these error bars, leading to ﬁnal

best computed isomerization energies at 0 K of 5.2±0.2 (cis-trans) and 24.1±0.2 (iso-trans)

kcal/mol.

Finally, in order to assess the performance of the ”Complete Basis Set” (CBS) hybrid

extrapolation/empirical correction schemes of Petersson and coworkers [61] for this problem,

we have calculated the TAE of N2N2 and the isomerization energies using the CBS-Q and

CBS-QCI/APNO models [55,61] as implemented in GAUSSIAN 94 [62]. The computed

∆H ◦

f,0 values of 50.9 (CBS-Q) and 50.8 (CBS-QCI/APNO) kcal/mol agree fairly poorly

9

with the present best estimate: about one-third of the discrepancy (0.61 kcal/mol) is due

to error in the approximate zero-point energy. The fact that G2 theory apparently agrees

better with the benchmark heat of formation for N2H2 than the CBS-Q and particularly

the CBS-QCI/APNO models goes against the general trend: e.g. for 14 experimentally very

precisely (0.1 kcal/mol or better) known total atomization energies, one of us [63] found mean

absolute errors of 1.32 kcal/mol for G2 theory, 0.82 kcal/mol for CBS-Q, and 0.45 kcal/mol

for CBS-QCI/APNO. (We recall for comparison that the corresponding error statistics for

the best extrapolation and 3-parameter correction used in the present work are 0.12 and

0.20 kcal/mol, respectively.) The cis-trans isomerization energy is computed as 5.2 kcal/mol

using both models, in perfect agreement with our best computed value; like for G2 theory,

the iso-trans isomerization energy is underestimated, at 23.6 kcal/mol by CBS-Q and 23.7

kcal/mol by the CBS-QCI/APNO model.

B. Geometries

All relevant data can be found in Table IV. Only for trans-HNNH are experimental geo-

metric data available. Until recently, these essentially consisted of the older rs (substitution)

structure of Carlotti et al. [64]. Very recently, Demaison, Hegelund, and B¨urger (DHB)

[12] published a newly reﬁned rz geometry: rz(NH)=1.041(1) ˚A, rz(NN)=1.252(1) ˚A, and

θ=106.3(1)◦. (For an overview of the deﬁnitions of various experimentally derived bond dis-

tances, see the review by Kuchitsu [65].) Using the average of rz − re corrections obtained

in three diﬀerent ways (extrapolation from diﬀerent isotopic values of rz, CCSD(T)/cc-

pVTZ calculated rotation-vibration coupling constants from Ref. [11], and their own MP2/6-

311+G(2d,p) harmonic force ﬁeld), they obtained the re geometry re(NH)=1.030(1) ˚A,

re(NN)=1.247(1) ˚A, and θe=106.3◦.

We found that the rz − re diﬀerence is only weakly aﬀected by basis set expansion

beyond CCSD(T)/cc-pVTZ: at the CCSD(T)/cc-pVQZ level, we obtain the correction

rz − re(NH)=0.01357 ˚A, rz − re(NN)=0.00550 ˚A, and θz − θe=0.061◦. Applying these to

10

the DHB rz values, we obtain an re geometry that principally diﬀers by r(NH) being about

0.002–0.003 ˚A shorter.

Another approach, such as we have followed in previous studies on e.g. ethylene [66] and

acetylene [67], consists of obtaining a best calculated geometry and computing ground state

rotational constants from it and the anharmonic force ﬁeld, then comparing the rotational

constants with experiment. For good agreement with experiment in directly calculated bond

distances, inclusion of inner-shell correlation is absolutely essential [48]. In this work, we ﬁnd

that inner-shell correlation shortens r(NN) by 0.0026 ˚A and r(NH) by 0.0013 ˚A, and opens

up the NNH bond angle by 0.12◦. Adding these contributions in to the CCSD(T)/cc-pVQZ

equilibrium geometry, we obtain re(NN)=1.2468 ˚A, re(NH)=1.0283 ˚A, and θe=106.17◦. From

these parameters and the CCSD(T)/cc-pVQZ force ﬁeld, we obtain A0, B0, and C0 values

which deviate from experiment by -0.04%, -0.06 %, and -0.07 %, respectively. These small

discrepancies suggest that our calculated geometry is considerably closer to experiment than

0.001 ˚A and 0.1◦.

However, it could be argued that since trans-HNNH has quite polar bonds, the use of dif-

fuse function basis sets is in order. And indeed, as can be seen from Table IV, adding

diﬀuse functions considerably speeds up basis set convergence in the bond angle, with

CCSD(T)/A′VTZ and CCSD(T)/A′VQZ bond angles now only diﬀering by 0.13◦ (compared

to 0.32◦ between CCSD(T)/VTZ and CCSD(T)/VQZ). Applying core-correlation correc-

tions now to the CCSD(T)/A′VQZ geometry, we obtain re(NN)=1.2464 ˚A, re(NH)=1.0288

˚A, and θe=106.37◦. Together with the CCSD(T)/cc-pVQZ force ﬁeld, our deviations for

the ground-state rotational constants are then +0.19%, -0.11%, and -0.09%, respectively.

Presumably due to an error compensation, the VQZ+core geometry appears to be the closer

to experiment.

error bars.

Both extrapolated geometries are in agreement about the fact that the DHB value for

re(NH) is about 0.002 ˚A too long. Other discrepancies with DHB fall within the latter’s

Our predicted geometries and ground-state rotational constants (Table IV) for the cis-

11

diazene and isodiazene isomers may facilitate future experimental work on these species.

C. Vibrational frequencies

Computed harmonic frequencies can be found in Table V. Computed and observed

fundamentals are given in Table VI, while computed anharmonicities and rotation-vibration

coupling constants are presented in Tables VII and VIII, respectively, together with the

relevant resonance constants.

The CCSD(T)/cc-pVQZ anharmonic force ﬁelds obtained in the present study were prin-

cipally calculated in order to obtain reliable zero-point vibrational energies for the thermo-

chemical calculations. The vibrational spectroscopy of trans-HNNH was discussed in detail

in MT, while too little experimental information is available for cis-HNNH to make a mean-

ingful comparison possible.

Based on our anharmonic force ﬁeld calculations, however, we can draw some qualitative

conclusions on the rotation-vibration spectrum of cis-HNNH. In particular, both ν1 and ν5

are involved in resonance triads, the former with 2ν3 and 2ν6, the latter with ν2 +ν6 ≈ ν5 and

ν2 + ν6 ≈ ν5. The eigenvectors of the former triad include essentially perfect 50:50 mixtures

of ν1 and 2ν6 states:

where we can again label the 2766.2 and 3002.5 cm−1 states as ν3 + ν6 and ν5, respectively,

based on the deperturbed band origins, but the states mix so strongly that the labeling is

again largely meaningless.

A very strong Coriolis resonance (Z a

46=7.79 cm−1) between ν4 and ν6 is predicted around

the a axis, as is a strong Coriolis resonance around the b axis between ν3 and ν4 (Z b
cm−1) and a weaker one between ν2 and ν6 around the c axis (Z c

34=-2.40
26=0.84 cm−1). The quality

of the computed Coriolis interaction parameters can be gauged by comparing CCSD(T)/cc-

pVQZ computed with experimentally derived values for trans-HNNH. While agreement be-

tween the computed very large Z a

46=8.708 cm−1 and the experimental value of Hegelund et al.
[13], 9.18234(58) cm−1, is not as good as one would hope, the more recent value of DHB [12],

8.5895 cm−1, is actually midway between our CCSD(T)/cc-pVTZ and CCSD(T)/cc-pVQZ

values. Agreement between computed and observed Z b

46 is likewise quite satisfactory.

Our calculations are rather diﬃcult to reconcile with the assignments of WFB, as well as

with the 1279 cm−1 assignment of RP; their 3074 cm−1 assignment could correspond to our

13

computed ν2 + ν6 band. Further experimental work on the cis molecule is clearly required:

we hope that our calculations may assist the latter.

In isodiazene, our calculations likewise ﬁnd four Fermi resonances: ν1 ≈ 2ν3, ν1 ≈ 2ν6,

ν2 ≈ 2ν4, and ν5 ≈ ν2 + ν6. Aside from these strong resonances, however, the computed

vibrational anharmonicities on the deperturbed ν1 and ν5 bands are exceedingly high: 274.5

and 314.8 cm−1 at the CCSD(T)/cc-pVQZ level. The only case known to the present authors

of a similarly large stretching anharmonicity in a tightly bound molecule is for the H–N

stretch in HNO, for which Lee et al. [68] calculated an anharmonic correction of 287.1 cm−1

at the same level of theory as used here. These authors, in comparisons between variational

calculations and vibrational perturbation theory found that the latter essentially breaks

down completely for HNO. It would then stand to reason that the same would occur for

isodiazene, and preliminary variational calculations with the POLYMODE program [69] do

indeed suggest such strong mixing that second-order perturbation theory is fundamentally

inappropriate as a treatment.

In the light thereof, it is perhaps not surprising that the

agreement between the computed fundamentals and the matrix IR data of Teles et al.

is

atypically poor for this level of theory. Moreover, we ﬁnd that the computed harmonic

frequencies and vibrational anharmonicities are unusually sensitive to the basis set. That is,

the deperturbed anharmonic corrections for ν1 and ν5 at the CCSD(T)/VTZ level are 278.4

and 335.8 cm−1 (the latter a diﬀerence of no less than 20 cm−1 with the CCSD(T)/VQZ

value!), while the corresponding harmonic frequencies change by 16 and 25 cm−1, respectively.

In addition we ﬁnd a very strong Coriolis resonance Z a

46=-11.96 cm−1, aside from a weaker
63=1.02 cm−1. Under these circumstances, it seems almost certain that a variational

one, Z c

treatment based on an approximate kinetic energy operator in the Watson Hamiltonian [70]

(such as implemented in the POLYMODE [69,71] program) will be likewise inadequate. No

tetratomic variational code with an exact kinetic energy operator (e.g. [72,73]) is available

to the present authors, and since this study principally concerns thermochemistry, we will

not pursue this point further in the present paper.

14

IV. CONCLUSIONS

A benchmark ab initio study on the thermochemistry of the trans-HNNH, cis-HNNH,

and H2NN isomers of diazene has been carried out. Our best computed ∆H ◦

f,0 for trans-

HNNH, 49.2±0.3 kcal/mol, is in very good agreement with a recent experimental lower

limit of 48.8±0.5 kcal/mol. CCSD(T) basis set limit values for the isomerization energies,

including contributions of inner-shell correlation and anharmonicity in the zero-point energy,

are 5.2±0.2 kcal/mol (cis-trans) and 24.1±0.2 kcal/mol (iso-trans). Performance of more

approximate methods such as G2 theory and the CBS-Q and CBS-QCI schemes was assessed

in detail for this system. For extrapolation of the SCF contribution to atomization energies,

the Feller-type exponential extrapolation A + B.C −l, rather than the two-point A + B/(l +

1/2)5 extrapolation, appears to be the formula of choice.

Our best computed geometry for trans-HNNH, re(NN)=1.2468 ˚A, re(NH)=1.0283 ˚A,

and θe=106.17◦, reproduces the precisely known ground-state rotational constants of trans-

HNNH to within better than 0.1 %. We conclude that the NH bond distance in the recent

experimental re geometry of Demaison et al. [12] is about 0.002 ˚A too long.

The rotation-vibration spectra of both cis-HNNH and H2NN are predicted to have very

strong Coriolis and Fermi resonances. In addition, the NH stretches in H2NN are so strongly

anharmonic that vibrational perturbation theory breaks down, and the molecule appears to

be an excellent test case for variational treatments of the vibrational Schr¨odinger equation.

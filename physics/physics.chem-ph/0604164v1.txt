Abstract

We present the fundamentals of geometrothermodynamics, an approach for study-
ing the properties of thermodynamic systems with n degrees of freedom in terms of
diﬀerential geometric concepts. It is based, on the one hand, upon the well-known
contact structure of the (2n + 1)−thermodynamic phase space and, on the other
hand, on the metric structure of the n−dimensional space of thermodynamic equi-
librium states. In order to make these two structures compatible we introduce the
set of Legendre invariant metrics in the thermodynamic phase space and demand
that by using the pullback they generate n−dimensional metrics on the space of
thermodynamic equilibrium states. We show that Weinhold’s metric, which was in-
troduced ad hoc, is not contained within this invariant set, but we also propose
several new Legendre invariant metrics which reproduce the most important geo-
metric properties of Weinhold’s metric.

1 Introduction

One of the ﬁrst applications of diﬀerential geometry in thermodynamics is due
to Gibbs [1] and to Caratheodory [2] who introduced the language of diﬀeren-
tial forms to manipulate thermodynamic variables in a simple manner. Those
studies were further developed in the seventies specially by Hermann [3] and
later by Mrugala [4,5], leading to a geometric approach in which the thermody-
namic phase space and its natural contact structure are the basic elements of
the construction. Extensive and intensive thermodynamic variables are taken
together with the thermodynamic potential to constitute well-deﬁned coor-
dinates in the thermodynamic phase space. The ﬁrst law of thermodynamics

is incorporated into this approach in a very natural way through diﬀerential
forms. It also allows to deﬁne thermodynamic equilibrium states in an exact
manner in terms of the pullback of the fundamental Gibbs 1-form.

Weinhold [6] proposed a second approach which is based on the introduc-
tion of a metric deﬁned ad hoc as the Hessian of the internal energy of a given
thermodynamic system, where the derivatives are taken with respect to the ex-
tensive thermodynamic variables. Consequently, Weinhold’s metric is deﬁned
on the space of thermodynamic equilibrium states. This metric turns out to
be positive as a consequence of the second law of thermodynamics. This ap-
proach has been intensively used to study, from a geometrical point of view,
the properties of the space generated by Weinhold’s metric [7,8], the ther-
modynamic length [9,10,11], the chemical and physical properties of various
two-dimensional thermodynamic systems [13,14,15,16,17], and the associated
Riemannian structure [18,19,20]. In an attempt to understand the concept of
thermodynamic length, Ruppeiner [18] introduced a metric which is given as
the Hessian of the entropy and is conformally equivalent to Weinhold’s met-
ric, with the inverse of the temperature as the conformal factor. The physical
meaning of Ruppeiner’s geometry lies in the ﬂuctuation theory of equilibrium
thermodynamics. It turns out that the second moments of ﬂuctuation are
related to the components of the inverse Ruppeiner’s metric. The correspond-
ing geometry has been investigated for several thermodynamic systems such
as the ideal (classic and quantum) gas, one-dimensional Ising model, multi-
component ideal gas, van der Waals gas, etc. It was shown that Ruppeiner’s
metric contains important information about the phase transition structure of
thermodynamic systems, indicating the location of critical points and phase
transitions on those particular surfaces where the scalar curvature diverges. In
the case of systems with no statistical mechanical interactions (e.g. an ideal
gas), the scalar curvature vanishes and consequently the geometry of the asso-
ciated two-dimensional space is ﬂat. For this reason the thermodynamic length
is considered as a measure of statistical mechanical interactions within a ther-
modynamic system. These results have been reviewed in [21] and more recent
results are included in [22,23]. Due to the conformal equivalence, Weinhold’s
metric contains similar information about the structure of phase transitions
as has been shown recently in [17]. Ruppeiner’s metric has found applications
also in the context of thermodynamics of black holes (see [24] and references
therein).

The two approaches mentioned above have been the subject of separate analy-
sis since the seventies, but the question about their relationship remains open.
Attempts to establish such a relationship were carried out in [12] and [25]. The
purpose was to replace the ad hoc introduction by a physical analysis from
which Weinhold’s metric could be derived. This part of the goal was success-
ful and the resulting metric was incorporated into the ﬁrst approach based
on the contact structure of the thermodynamic phase space. However, this

2

metric turned out to be non-invariant with respect to Legendre transforma-
tions, leading to the unpleasant property that a given thermodynamic system
had diﬀerent geometrical properties, when diﬀerent thermodynamic potentials
were used. In the context of geometrothermodynamics, Legendre invariance
will play a crucial role and, therefore, Weinhold’s metric cannot be considered
as fundamental.

The main purpose of the present work is to show that both approaches can be
uniﬁed into a single approach by using purely mathematical considerations.
We will call this approach geometrothermodynamics. The idea is simple. We
ﬁrst consider an arbitrary Riemannian metric in the thermodynamic phase
space. Then, we derive the conditions for this metric to be invariant with re-
spect to arbitrary Legendre transformations of the thermodynamic variables.
Furthermore, we demand that the metric of the thermodynamic equilibrium
space corresponds to the pullback of the Riemannian metric introduced on
the thermodynamic phase space. In particular, we derive the conditions that
the Riemannian metric must satisfy in order to induce Weinhold’s metric and
show that they are compatible with the conditions of Legendre invariance,
up to a multiplicative factor which not only aﬀects the geometric properties
of Weinhold’s metric, but it also violates the second law of thermodynamics,
making it not suitable for a complete and invariant description of thermody-
namic systems. Nevertheless, we ﬁnd explicit Legendre invariant metrics on
the space of equilibrium states which reproduce the most important properties
of Weinhold’s metric.

Geometrothermodynamics is thus a unifying approach which allows us to treat
thermodynamics in a geometric language either at the level of the thermody-
namic phase space or in the space of thermodynamic equilibrium states. The
method introduced by Weinhold, or equivalently by Ruppeiner, turns out to be
only one single metric structure which corresponds to a whole class of metrics
in the thermodynamic phase space. However, this class of metrics does not sat-
isfy the condition of Legendre invariance. Within the set of Legendre invariant
metrics we ﬁnd several examples which generate diﬀerent metric structures on
the space of equilibrium states, all of them sharing the interesting property
that their curvature vanishes in the case of an ideal gas. This resembles one
of the main properties of Weinhold’s metric which made if specially appro-
priate to introduce the concept of thermodynamic length. Our results show
that this can be done in many diﬀerent ways and open the question about
how to constraint the arbitrariness of the approach. The ﬁrst attempt to-
wards a formulation of geometrothermodynamics was presented in [26] where
the connection, torsion and curvature of the fundamental Gibbs 1-form were
used to construct a geometry which becomes degenerate in thermodynamic
equilibrium.

This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we present the main geometric

3

structures which are necessary for the formulation of our geometric approach
to thermodynamics. This includes the contact structure, Legendre invariance
and the metric structures on the thermodynamic phase space as well as on the
space of thermodynamic equilibrium states. In Section 3 we present the explicit
form of the geometrothermodynamic structures in the case of two-dimensional
thermodynamic systems. We analyze Weinhold’s approach and show that it
does not satisfy all the requirements necessary to describe thermodynamic
systems in an invariant manner. We ﬁnd the conditions for a metric to be
Legendre invariant in the thermodynamic phase space and show that there
exist many metrics with this property. We propose several particular metrics
which can be used in our geometric approach to thermodynamics. Further-
more, in Section 4 we analyze the simple case of an ideal gas and ﬁnd a metric
whose curvature can be used as a measure of thermodynamic interaction. Fi-
nally, Section 5 is devoted to discussions of our results and suggestions for
further research.

2 Fundamentals of geometrothermodynamics

In this section, following [3] we ﬁrst review the main aspects of the contact
structure used in thermodynamics. Then, we introduce a metric structure
and investigate the conditions for it to be invariant with respect to Legendre
transformations. This is then used to postulate the conditions which constitute
the central part of our geometrothermodynamic approach.

For the description of thermodynamic systems a set of variables is introduced
that represents the true degrees of freedom like internal energy U, entropy
S, volume V , etc. which are called extensive variables. Furthermore, intensive
variables like temperature T , pressure P , etc. are used to describe the energy
transport into and out of these degrees of freedom [27]. Usually the number of
degrees of freedom n represents the number of extensive variables (excluding
the internal energy) which are necessary to completely describe the system.
To present our approach in the most general manner we will use an arbi-
trary thermodynamic potential with n independent extensive variables and,
correspondingly, n independent intensive variables.

2.1 The contact structure

The ﬁrst step to introduce the language of diﬀerential geometry in thermody-
namics is the deﬁnition of the (2n+1)-dimensional thermodynamic phase space,
T , which can be coordinatized by the set Z A = {Φ, Ea, I a}, where Φ is the
thermodynamic potential, and Ea and I a denote the extensive and intensive

4

variables, respectively. Here we adopt the conventions A = 0, ..., 2n and a =
1, ..., n so that Φ = Z 0, Ea = Z a, and I a = Z n+a. Clearly, all the coordinates
Z A are supposed to be well-deﬁned at least in an open region of T which is
topologically equivalent to the Euclidean space R2n+1. Accordingly, in the tan-
gent space of T a coordinate basis {∂A = ∂/∂Z A} = {∂/∂Φ, ∂/∂Ea, ∂/∂I a}
is introduced which generates the dual basis {dZ A} = {dΦ, dEa, dI a} in the
corresponding cotangent space. This construction allows us to introduce in
particular the fundamental Gibbs 1-form

ΘG = dΦ − δabI adEb ,

δab = diag(1, 1, ..., 1)

where we assume the convention of summation over repeated indices. The
pair (T , ΘG) is called a contact manifold [3] if T is a (2n + 1)−dimensional
diﬀerentiable manifold and ΘG is a linear diﬀerential form such that

ΘG ∧ (dΘG)n 6= 0

where (dΘG)n = dΘG ∧ ... ∧ dΘG (n times) and ∧ represents the exterior
product. Notice that it is possible to introduce other linear diﬀerential linear
forms Θ satisfying Eq.(2) so that there exist many diﬀerent contact structures
in T . The special choice ΘG is important for our purposes, in particular,
because it is invariant with respect to Legendre transformations (see below),
and reproduces the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics.

Consider now the n−dimensional space E spanned by the coordinates Ea. This
can be realized by considering the smooth mapping ϕ as

ϕ : E −→

T

ϕ : (Ea) 7−→ (Φ, Ea, I a) ,

with Φ = Φ(Ea). Here we are considering the particular case in which the
coordinates in E are the extensive variables Ea; however, in the most general
allowed case one can consider E as spanned by any n−dimensional subset {Z a}
of the set of coordinates {Z A}, under the condition that ϕ(Z a) for each a is
a well-deﬁned coordinate on E. The pullback ϕ∗ induced by the mapping ϕ
acts on diﬀerential forms deﬁned on (the cotangent space of) T and generates
diﬀerential forms deﬁned on (the cotangent space of) E. In particular, the
pullback of the Gibbs 1-form ϕ∗(ΘG) is a well-deﬁned object.

With the natural elements deﬁned above on T we can now deﬁne the space of
thermodynamic equilibrium states, E, as the particular subspace of T given by
the embedding mapping ϕ : E → T , deﬁned in Eq.(3), for which the condition

(4)

ϕ∗(ΘG) = ϕ∗

= 0

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

holds. It is easy to see that this condition implies that

∂Φ
∂Ea = δabI b

dΦ − δabI adEb = 0 .

which is immediately recognized as the standard conditions of equilibrium
thermodynamics. Consequently, on the space of equilibrium states E the con-
dition (4) leads to the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics

To diﬀerentiate one thermodynamic system from another in the space of equi-
librium states, one usually speciﬁes one or several equations of state which are
relationships between diﬀerent thermodynamic variables. Alternatively, one
can specify the fundamental equation from which all the equations of state
can be derived [27]. In the representation we are using here for the thermody-
namic phase space, the fundamental equation is contained in the embedding
mapping (3) through the relationship Φ = Φ(Ea). This construction must be
complemented with the second law of thermodynamics which is also known
as the convexity condition of the thermodynamic potential [29]. Like the ﬁrst
law of thermodynamics, this condition is the result of phenomenological ob-
servations and means that the matrix of second derivatives of Φ is positive:

∂2Φ

∂Ea∂Eb ≥ 0 .

For further details on the geometric meaning of the convexity condition see,
for instance, [30].

Furthermore, the thermodynamic potential must satisfy the homogeneity con-
dition Φ(λEa) = λβΦ(Ea) for constants parameters λ and β. In classical ther-
modynamics the degree of homogeneity is one, meaning that the Ea’s are
strictly extensive variables. For the sake of generality and for future applica-
tions in thermodynamics of physical ﬁelds, we also consider the case of sub-
extensive (β < 1) and supra-extensive (β > 1) variables. Diﬀerentiating the
homogeneity condition with respect to λ and evaluating the result at λ = 1,
we get

∂Φ(Ea)
∂Ea Ea = βΦ(Ea) ,

βΦ(Ea) = δabI bEa ,

an expression which transforms into Euler’s identity

(5)

(6)

(7)

(8)

(9)

after using the duality condition (5). Furthermore, calculating the exterior
derivative of Euler’s identity and introducing the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics
(6), we obtain the generalized Gibbs-Duhem relation

(1 − β)δabI adEb + δabEadI b = 0 .

(10)

The classical expressions for Euler’s identity and Gibbs-Duhem relation are
obtained from the above equations by putting β = 1.

2.2 Legendre invariance

Legendre transformations are a special case of contact transformations which
leave invariant the contact structure of T . In physical terms, Legendre invari-
ance means that the thermodynamic properties of a system are independent
of the thermodynamic potential used to describe it. Let us consider a partial
Legendre transformation that is deﬁned as follows

{Z A} −→ {

Z A} = { ˜Φ, ˜Ea, ˜I a}

(11)

e

with [28]

Φ = ˜Φ − δkl ˜Ek ˜I l , Ei = − ˜I i, Ej = ˜Ej,

I i = ˜Ei, I j = ˜I j ,

(12)

where i ∪ j is any disjoint decomposition of the set of indices {1, ..., n}, and
k, l = 1, ..., i. In particular, for i = {1, ..., n} and i = ∅ we obtain the total
Legendre transformation and the identity, respectively. In the further discus-
sions we will always consider total Legendre transformations for the sake of
simplicity. The main results will not be aﬀected by this simpliﬁcation.

The invariance of the contact structure introduced above becomes evident from
the fact that in the new coordinates { ˜Z A} the Gibbs 1-form becomes ˜ΘG =
d ˜Φ − δab ˜I ad ˜Eb, an expression which is functionally equivalent to the original
one given in Eq.(1). If we now repeat the analysis of the last subsection, we
will be able to establish the invariant character of the duality condition (5)
and the ﬁrst (6) and second (7) laws of thermodynamics.

Notice that a Legendre transformation interchanges the character of the exten-
sive and intensive variables. For this reason, to establish the validity of Euler’s
identity and, consequently, the Gibbs-Duhem relation in the new variables it
is necessary to identify ﬁrst the extensive variables ˜Ea and the fundamental
equation ˜Φ = ˜Φ( ˜Ea). Then, Legendre invariance follows from the fact that the
duality condition (5) and the ﬁrst law (6) are invariant.

2.3 Metric structure on the thermodynamic phase space

Let us consider a non-degenerate metric GAB on the thermodynamic phase
space T . As functions of the coordinates {Z A} in T , the components of the
metric GAB only need to satisfy the standard diﬀerentiability conditions in
order to have a well-deﬁned Riemannian structure in T . That is, the compo-
nents of GAB must be at least C 2-functions in the charts that determine the
atlas of T . In other words, with GAB we must be able to construct a well-
deﬁned Riemann curvature tensor in T . Let us recall that the mapping ϕ as
given in Eq.(3) induces the pullback mapping ϕ∗ which is used to “project”
geometric objects from T down to the space of thermodynamic equilibrium
states E. In particular, this can be done for the metric structure G. Now we
can formulate the main statement of geometrothermodynamics. To describe a
given thermodynamic system it is necessary to have a metric G which is called
a thermodynamic metric if it satisﬁes the following conditions:

1. G is invariant with respect to transformations which do not modify the
contact structure of T . In particular, G must be invariant with respect to
Legendre transformations.

2. G induces in the space of equilibrium states E an invariant metric g by
means of the mapping

ϕ∗(G) = g .

(13)

The idea behind condition 1 is that a thermodynamic metric can describe a
thermodynamic system, independently of the coordinates used in T . This con-
dition is necessary in order for geometrothermodynamics to be able to describe
thermodynamic properties in terms of geometric concepts in a manner which
must be invariant with respect to changes of the thermodynamic potential.
Condition 2 establishes the relationship between the geometry on T and the
geometry on E by using the same tools that are used to deﬁne equilibrium
states in the contact structure approach.

It is clear that from the Legendre invariance of G if follows the invariance of
g, when it is deﬁned as given in Eq.(13). In fact, if we denote by ˜G = ˜G( ˜Z A)
the metric obtained from G by applying the Legendre transformation (12),
and let G′( ˜Z A) = G(Z A = ˜Z A), then the Legendre invariance of G can be
satisﬁed by demanding that ˜G( ˜Z A) = G′( ˜Z A). Furthermore, since g = ϕ∗(G)
and g′ = ˜ϕ∗(G′) with ˜ϕ deﬁned as in Eq.(3) with Z A = ˜Z A, then we have that
˜g = ˜ϕ∗( ˜G) = ˜ϕ∗(G′) = g′, i.e. g is an invariant metric.

8

Under a total Legendre transformation, Z A → ˜Z A as given in Eq.(12), the
components of the metric G transform as a tensor. i.e.

GAB → ˜GAB =

∂Z C
∂ ˜Z A

∂Z D
∂ ˜Z B

GCD ,

(14)

and the transformation matrix can be obtained in a straightforward manner
from Eq.(12) as

1 − ˜Z n+1 − ˜Z n+2 ... − ˜Z 2n − ˜Z 1 − ˜Z 2 ... − ˜Z n

where the indices A and B represent rows and columns, respectively. The
determinant of this matrix can be shown to be equal to one, meaning that the
inverse transformation exists. Consequently, the matrix (15) determines the
diﬀeomorphism corresponding to a total Legendre transformation.

To guarantee that the metric G in T is Legendre invariant it is suﬃcient to
demand that each of its components preserves its functional dependence after
a Legendre transformation. Let ˜GAB( ˜Z C) = GAB(Z C → ˜Z C) represent the
components of the metric ˜G obtained after a Legendre transformation (12) of
the metric G, and let G′
AB( ˜Z C) = GAB(Z C = ˜Z C) be the components of the
metric G′ obtained by replacing each coordinate Z C by its counterpart ˜Z C in
the metric G (no Legendre transformation is applied). Then, if we demand
that the condition

˜GAB( ˜Z C) = G′

AB( ˜Z C)

(16)

holds for each value of A and B, we guarantee that the metrics G on T as
well as g on E are Legendre invariant.

An important issue to be addressed when imposing invariance conditions on
metrics is the one related to the existence of solutions. In our case, the point
is whether there exist metrics which satisfy the condition of invariance under
Legendre transformations as given, for instance, in Eq.(16). In fact, it is easy

9

to construct an invariant (2n + 1)−dimensional metric by deﬁning the Gibbs
metric as the “square” of the Gibbs 1-form (1), i.e.

G = ΘG ⊗ ΘG = Θ2

G = dΦ2 − 2δabI adEbdΦ + δabδcdI aI cdEbdEd .

(17)

The invariance of this metric follows from the invariance of the Gibbs 1-form.
Since the Gibbs metric does not possess components proportional to dI a, its
determinant vanishes. Nevertheless, it contains an (n + 1)-dimensional metric
in the sector {dΦ, dEa} with non-vanishing determinant. So we see that the
Gibbs metric is in general a degenerate thermodynamic metric. Nevertheless,
later on we will use this degenerate metric to construct explicit examples of
non-degenerate 5-dimensional metrics which satisfy the Legendre invariance
condition.

3 Systems with two degrees of freedom

In this Section we will analyze the explicit case of simple mono-component
systems. This assumption is only for the sake of simplicity since we are going
to handle explicit 5-dimensional and 2-dimensional metrics related through
the geometrothermodynamic approach described above. After presenting the
general construction for this simple case, we critically analyze Weinhold’s 2-
dimensional metric and its generating 5-dimensional metric on the thermo-
dynamic phase space. We also propose some alternative metrics which are
Legendre invariant.

3.1 Two-dimensional geometrothermodynamics

Let us consider a thermodynamic system with only two degrees of freedom.
The thermodynamic phase space T is therefore a 5-dimensional manifold for
which we choose the coordinates

{Z A} = {Φ, Ea, I a} = {U, S, V, T, −P } ,

in accordance with standard notations and conventions of thermodynamics
[27]. The Gibbs 1-form is then given by

(18)

(19)

ΘG = dU − T dS + P dV ,

10

and deﬁnes the contact structure of T . The 2-dimensional space of equilibrium
states is determined through the embedding mapping

ϕ : (S, V ) 7−→ [U(S, V ), S, V, T (S, V ), P (S, V )] ,

(20)

so that the condition ϕ∗(ΘG) = 0 implies the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics
dU = T dS − P dV with

∂U
∂S

= T ,

= −P .

∂U
∂V

(21)

Notice that the fundamental equation U = U(S, V ) is contained in the deﬁni-
tion of the mapping (20), as mentioned in Section 2.1. Moreover, the depen-
dence of the intensive variables T and P in terms of the extensive variables S
and V is induced through the conditions (21). The Euler identity and Gibbs-
Duhem equation in this case can be written as

βU − T S + P V = 0 , SdT − V dP + (1 − β)dU = 0 ,

(22)

and reduce to their standard form when β = 1, i.e., when S and V are strictly
extensive variables.

A total Legendre transformation (U, S, V, T, −P ) 7−→ ( ˜U , ˜S, ˜V , ˜T , − ˜P ) is de-
ﬁned in this case by means of the relationships

U = ˜U − ˜S ˜T + ˜P ˜V , S = − ˜T , V = ˜P , T = ˜S , P = − ˜V ,

(23)

and the corresponding transformation matrix reduces to

1 − ˜T

When compared to the general transformation matrix (15), the last matrix
contains several diﬀerences in the signs which are due to the choice of the
pressure as P = −Z 4. Also, it is convenient to write the general 5-dimensional
metric of T as (I, J, ... = 1, ...4)

G = G00dU 2 + 2G0IdUdX I + GIJdX IdX J , X I = (S, V, T, P ) ,

(25)

11

so that the negative sign of Z 4 does not aﬀect the sign of the metric compo-
nents.

According to our construction of geometrothermodynamics, we must demand
that the metric (25) be invariant with respect to Legendre transformations.
If the components GAB are given as functions of the coordinates of the ther-
modynamic phase space, a total Legendre transformation leads to a set of
algebraic equations which are explicitly given in Appendix A, where we also
show the existence of solutions. For a general 5-dimensional metric G we can
also compute the corresponding 2-dimensional metric g by using the pullback
of the mapping (20), i.e.

g = ϕ∗(G) = g11dS2 + 2g12dSdV + g22dV 2

+ 2UV V (−G24 + G04P − G34USV ) + 2USV (G23 − G03P ) ,

(29)

where the subscript of U represent partial derivatives, and we used equations
(21) in the form US = T, UV = −P . This is the most general metric that
can exist on the space of equilibrium states E. The further speciﬁcation of the
fundamental equation U = U(S, V ) ﬁxes completely the metric structure in
terms of the components GAB which, in general, become arbitrary functions
of S and V , due to the deﬁnition of the embedding mapping (20). This ar-
bitrariness can be restricted by considering only Legendre invariant metrics
G. In fact, if we apply a total Legendre transformation on the 5-dimensional
metric (25), the new metric ˜G = G(Z A → ˜Z A) will be Legendre invariant if
its components satisfy the conditions (A.3). Furthermore, if we start from a
Legendre invariant metric ˜G and perform the pullback determined by means
of the mapping

˜ϕ( ˜S, ˜V ) 7−→ [ ˜U ( ˜S, ˜V ), ˜S, ˜V , ˜T ( ˜S, ˜V ), ˜P ( ˜S, ˜V )] ,

(30)

12

we will obtain a new metric ˜g = ˜ϕ∗( ˜G) whose components satisfy the relation-
ship

˜gab( ˜S, ˜V ) = g′

ab( ˜S, ˜V ) = gab(Z A = ˜Z A, GAB = ˜GAB) ,

(31)

where gab are given in Eqs.(27)–(29). In other words, if the starting metric G
is Legendre invariant, the resulting metric g = ϕ(G) is also Legendre invariant
and its components are given again as in Eqs.(27)–(29).

We found the explicit form of the most general 2-dimensional metric g on E,
starting from a general 5-dimensional metric G on T . The set of algebraic
equations (27)–(29) also allows us to analyze the inverse problem, i.e. if we
know the explicit components gab of a metric on E, we can ﬁnd from equations
(27)–(29) the most general form of the metric G which generates g by means
of the pullback. In this manner, we can determine whether a given metric g
can be obtained from a Legendre invariant metric G.

As a simple example let us consider the 2-dimensional Euclidean metric

gE = dS2 + dV 2 .

(32)

Introducing these values into (27)–(29), we see that the generating metric can
be written as

GE = G00[dU 2 + (T dS − P dV )2] + dS2 + dV 2 + 2G0IdX IΘG ,

(33)

where X I = (S, V, T, P ) and ΘG = dU − T dS + P dV is the fundamental
Gibbs 1-form for systems with two degrees of freedom. The components G0A
remain as arbitrary functions of the coordinates of T . This is an example of
the freedom which exists in the determination of 2-dimensional metrics on
E in terms of the pullback of 5-dimensional metrics on T . A straightforward
calculation shows that the determinant of GE vanishes identically, making this
metric unsuitable for describing a Riemannian structure on T . Nevertheless, to
show the details of the procedure, we want to explore the Legendre invariance
of the Euclidean metric on E. Applying a total Legendre transformation (23)
to GE, we obtain

˜GE = G00 ˜Θ2

G + d ˜T 2 + d ˜P 2

+ 2(−G01d ˜T + G02d ˜P + G03d ˜S − G04d ˜V ) ˜ΘG ,

(34)

where we used the Gibbs-Duhem relation ˜V d ˜P − ˜Sd ˜T = 0 in the new variables
to simplify the ﬁnal result. Finally, we calculate the pullback determined by
the embedding mapping (30) and obtain

13

˜gE = ˜ϕ∗( ˜GE) =

2

∂2 ˜U
∂ ˜Ea∂Eb !

˜V ˜V + ˜U 2

˜S ˜V )d ˜V 2,(35)

an expression which is functionally diﬀerent from the starting metric (32).
This shows that the 2-dimensional Euclidean metric gE is not invariant with
respect to Legendre transformations and, consequently, is not appropriate for
describing any thermodynamic system in the context of geometrothermody-
namics.

3.2 Weinhold’s approach

Weinhold proposed to study the geometry of thermodynamic systems by
means of a metric which is introduced ad hoc on the space of equilibrium
states E. In the case of a system with two degrees of freedom, it corresponds
to a 2-dimensional metric with components given in terms of the second deriva-
tives of the internal energy with respect to the extensive variables. When the
entropy representation is used, an alternative metric can be deﬁned again as
the Hessian of the entropy (Ruppeiner’s metric) which, however, turns out
to be conformally equivalent to Weinhold’s metric. Since any metric on a 2-
dimensional space is conformally equivalent to the Euclidean metric, it seems
reasonable to expect a conformal equivalence between all 2-dimensional met-
rics, when arbitrary diﬀeomorphisms are allowed.

In the energy view we are using here, Weinhold’s metric is given by

gW =

∂2U
∂Ea∂Eb !

 

dEadEb = USSdS2 + 2USV dSdV + UV V dV 2 .

(36)

An important property of Weinhold’s metric is that it is positive deﬁnite
since its components coincide with the matrix components of the second law
of thermodynamics (7). To determine the 5-dimensional metric on T that
generates Weinhold’s metric, we introduce its components into equations (27)–
(29). After an algebraic rearrangement, the resulting metric can be written as

GW = G00[dU 2 − (T dS − P dV )2] + dSdV − dT dP + 2G0IdX IΘG.

(37)

We see that the generating metric is not unique, but it possesses ﬁve degrees of
freedom which are contained in the ﬁve arbitrary functions G0A. The rest of the
components of GAB are ﬁxed through the components of Weinhold’s metric.

14

A special case of this generating metric was proposed in [25] and corresponds
to the particular choice G00 = 1, G01 = −T, G02 = P, G03 = G04 = 0.

The next important question is whether the metric GW is invariant with re-
spect to arbitrary Legendre transformations. Introducing the explicit compo-
nents of GW into the conditions of Legendre invariance given in Eqs.(A.3), one
can see that they are not satisﬁed, independently of the values of the arbi-
trary functions G0A. Consequently, Weinhold’s metric is not Legendre invari-
ant, making it inappropriate for describing thermodynamic systems. However,
if one would insist on using it, the properties of the system would depend on
the thermodynamic potential used in gW . This, of course, is a disadvantage
which is suﬃcient for dismissing this metric as unphysical. Nevertheless, to
see the cause of the problem with Weinhold’s metric, we perform a total Leg-
endre transformation on GW to obtain a new metric ˜GW . Then we calculate
its pullback ˜ϕ∗( ˜GW ) = ˜gW and obtain

˜gW = −

∂2 ˜U
∂ ˜Ea∂ ˜Eb !

 

d ˜Ead ˜Eb .

(38)

We see that the non-invariant character of this metric lies in the change of the
metric signature. One could naively think that the additional “parity trans-
formation” ˜U → − ˜U would preserve invariance. However, this parity trans-
formation on E is not allowed because it does not correspond to a Legendre
transformation on T . Another possibility could be to consider a “quadratic”
Weinhold’s metric so that the signature becomes invariant. Unfortunately, this
simple alternative is also not allowed because the resulting metric is not in-
variant. In fact, this is the example we presented in Section 3.1. There, it was
shown that the Euclidean metric gE turns into the quadratic Weinhold’s metric
(35) after a Legendre transformation. The inverse transformation would then
transform the quadratic Weinhold’s metric into the Euclidean one which, as
we mentioned above, is not suitable for a geometrothermodynamic approach.

3.3 Legendre invariant metrics

Following the procedure described in Appendix A, it is in principle very sim-
ple to ﬁnd Legendre invariant metrics. By assuming a polynomial dependence
of the metric components in terms of the thermodynamic variables, we de-
rive in Eqs.(A.4) a particular solution which possesses twelve arbitrary real
constants. Clearly, more general solutions can be obtained by starting from
metric components with a diﬀerent functional dependence.

In this Section, however, we will derive several Legendre invariant metrics
by using a simple and intuitive method. From the deﬁnition of a Legendre

15

transformation given in (12), it follows that metrics with no dΦ terms and
a[I adEa + EadI a]2 are in-
a[(dEa)2 + (dI a)2] and
combinations of the form
variant with respect to Legendre transformations. This can be used as a guide
to construct invariant metrics. In particular, for systems with two degrees of
freedom let us consider the following metric

P

P

GI = Θ2

G + c1T SdT dS + c2P V dP dV + dS2 + dV 2 + dT 2 + dP 2,

(39)

which is Legendre invariant for any values of the real constants c1 and c2. The
term Θ2
has been added in order to avoid the degeneracy of GI. The pullback
of this metric ϕ∗(GI) = gI generates a 2-dimensional metric on E which in a
matrix representation can be written as

G

gI = 11 + (gW )2 + 



c1T SUSS

1
2 (c1T S − c2P V )USV

1
2(c1T S − c2P V )USV

−c2P V UV V

,

(40)






where 11 is the unit matrix and gW represents Weinhold’s metric (36). The
special case c1 = c2 = 0 corresponds to the Hern´andez–Lacomba metric [20]
which is also Legendre invariant. If we choose c1 = c2 we can use Euler’s
identity, U = T S − P V , in (40) to obtain a metric which depends explicitly
on the value of the internal energy and not only on its derivatives.

Consider now the following 5-dimensional metric

GII = Θ2

G + c2

1(T dS + ǫ1SdT )2 + c2

2(P dV + ǫ2V dP )2 ,

(41)

which is Legendre invariant for ǫ1, ǫ2 = ±1 and arbitrary real values of c1
and c2. In this case we also have that det(GII) 6= 0 due to presence of the
Gibbs metric. A straightforward computation of the pullback of GII leads to
the following metric on E

gII = hhT , with h = 



c1(ǫ1T + SUSS)

−c2V USV

c1SUSV

c2(ǫ2P − V UV V )

,

(42)






where hT denotes the transpose matrix. We will see in the next Section that
this metric resembles the behavior of Weinhold’s metric in the case of an ideal
gas.

Clearly, the metrics presented above can easily be generalized to the case of a
system with n degrees of freedom, preserving Legendre invariance. Dropping

16

constant factors, the generalized (2n + 1)-dimensional metrics can be written
as

GI = Θ2

G + δabEbI adEadI b + δab(dEadEb + dI adI b) ,

GII = Θ2

G + δab(I adEb + EadI b)2 ,

(43)

(44)

where now ΘG is the corresponding Gibbs 1-form (1) for a thermodynamic
system with n degrees of freedom.

All the examples we have presented here are characterized by the fact that
the metric components can be written as polynomials of the thermodynamic
variables. Solving the algebraic conditions described in Appendix A, it is also
possible to derive Legendre invariant metrics on T whose components are ra-
tional functions of the variables. The corresponding pullback generates metrics
on E with rather cumbersome structures which, nevertheless, are allowed in
the context of geometrothermodynamics.

4 The ideal gas

In our opinion, one of the most interesting properties of Weinhold’s metric
is that its curvature vanishes in the case of a non-interacting thermodynamic
system, i.e. an ideal gas. For more general systems the curvature turns out to
be non-vanishing and, therefore, it has been postulated that it could be used
as a measure for thermodynamic interaction. Although we have shown that
Weinhold’s metric is not compatible with the requirements of geometrother-
modynamics, we would like to preserve in our approach this interesting inter-
pretation of curvature. To this end, we need to show that there exists at least
one Legendre invariant metric whose curvature vanishes in the case of an ideal
gas. We will show that in fact we already have a metric with this property.

Let us recall that for a 2-dimensional metric gab there exists only one inde-
pendent component of the Riemann curvature tensor Rabcd which completely
determines the curvature scalar R = gacgbdRabcd. In turn, the curvature scalar
can be expressed as follows

R =

where a comma denotes partial diﬀerentiation. As mentioned before, all the
information about a speciﬁc system is contained in the fundamental equation.
In the case of an ideal gas it can be written as

where k is Boltzmann’s constant and we have chosen N = 1 for simplicity.
From this fundamental equation one calculates the standard thermodynamic
variables which are related through the equation of state P V = kT . Finally,
the constant entropy is also determined by means of Euler’s identity. Intro-
ducing this fundamental equation into the components of the metric gI given
in (40) and computing the corresponding curvature scalar, we obtain a rather
cumbersome expression with the structure of a polynomial in U and V . An
analysis of this expression shows that it is not a constant and is always dif-
ferent from zero, independently of the values of c1 and c2. We conclude that
the curvature of the metric gI is non zero and cannot be used as a measure of
thermodynamic interaction. Consider now the metric gII as given in Eq.(42).
A straightforward computation of its components with the fundamental equa-
tion (47) leads to the following result:

The corresponding scalar curvature turns out to be proportional to a constant
factor which involves the constants c1, c2, ǫ1, and ǫ2. It is then possible to
show that the arbitrary constants c1 and c2 can always be chosen in such a
way that the constant factor vanishes. For the particular case ǫ1 = ǫ2 = 1, the
condition for a vanishing curvature can be written as

1k2(25k4 + 5k2 + 21) = 4c2
c2

2(1 − k2) .

Consequently, the curvature associated with the metric gII reproduces the
behavior of Weinhold’s metric for an ideal gas, and can be used to describe
thermodynamic interactions in a Legendre invariant manner. We have calcu-
lated the curvature scalar for the metric gII in the case of the van der Waals
gas with the conclusion that it does not vanish for any values of the con-
stants c1 and c2. This is also in accordance with the intuitive expectation for
a quantity that measures the interaction in thermodynamic systems.

5 Conclusions

In this work we formulated the fundamentals of geometrothermodynamics,
an approach which uniﬁes the contact structure of the thermodynamic phase
space T with the metric structure of the space of thermodynamic equilib-
rium states E ⊂ T . The unifying object is a Riemannian metric structure
on T which must be invariant with respect to Legendre transformations and
compatible with the metric structure induced on E by means of the pullback.

It was shown how the ﬁrst and second laws of thermodynamics, as well as
Euler’s identity and the Gibbs-Duhem relation, are invariant with respect to
Legendre transformations. We found explicitly the conditions under which the
Legendre transformations are also isometries for the metric structure intro-
duced on T . This leads to a system of algebraic equations for the components
of the metric. Several particular solutions were found for this system. All the
solutions found turned out to be represented as polynomials in terms of the
coordinates of T , but it is possible to derive more general solutions.

We analyzed in detail the case of thermodynamic systems with two degrees of
freedom. Weinhold’s approach was investigated for this case and we found that
it does not satisfy the conditions of Legendre invariance and, therefore, cannot
be used to describe thermodynamic systems in an invariant way. In particular,
we saw that it is in conﬂict with the second law of thermodynamics.

As an explicit example of a simple thermodynamic system we investigated the
ideal gas. Within the set of Legendre invariant metrics included in this work,
we found one particular metric whose curvature vanishes in the case of an
ideal gas. This result makes this metric especially suitable for measuring the
interaction in thermodynamic systems. Also, this metric could be used for the
deﬁnition of an invariant thermodynamic length.

It would be interesting to continue the study of the metrics presented here in
the case of more complicated thermodynamic systems like the van der Waals
gas, Ising model, multi-component ideal gas, etc. This would shed light on
the signiﬁcance of these metrics. It would be interesting to ﬁnd out if our

19

metrics also contain information about critical points and phase transitions of
interacting thermodynamic systems. On the other hand, our approach opens
the possibility of investigating simultaneously the geometric structure not only
in the space of equilibrium states, but also at the level of the thermodynamic
phase space. This tasks will be treated in future works.

Our geometrothermodynamic approach opens new possibilities to study ther-
modynamic systems in terms of geometric objects. At the same time, we will
have to face new challenges. In particular, we have found a huge arbitrariness
in our description. For instance, the study of the ideal gas allowed us to stand
out the metric gII given in Section 4, because its curvature vanishes when the
fundamental equation of an ideal gas is introduced. However, our results seem
to indicate that this is not a special property of that metric. With the help
of the algebraic conditions presented in Appendix A, it would be possible to
ﬁnd more metrics with the same property. It seems that we need additional
criteria to select or classify metrics on the thermodynamic phase space. Un-
derstanding the metric in this context represents an interesting problem for
future investigations.

˜G00 = G00 ,
˜G01 = G03 − G00 ˜T ,
˜G02 = −G04 + G00 ˜P ,

This represents a system of algebraic equations for the components GAB which,

to a particular solution which can be derived by considering an ansatz where
G0A depends linearly on Z A and the GIK’s are quadratic functions of the co-
ordinates. A lengthly but straightforward computation shows that the metric

is completely invariant with respect to total Legendre transformations. Here
c1, ..., c12 represent arbitrary real constants and in general det(GAB) is non-

vanishing. This particular solution shows that there exist non-trivial thermo-
dynamic metrics which can be used to introduce Riemannian structures in
the thermodynamic phase space. It is possible to derive other particular so-
lutions by assuming a polynomial dependence of higher degree for all metric
components GAB. We also investigated the case of rational and exponential
functions, and obtained similar results.

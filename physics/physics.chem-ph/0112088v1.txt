For studying the group theoretical classiﬁcation of the solutions of the

density functional theory in relativistic framework, we propose quantum

electrodynamical density-matrix functional theory ( QED-DMFT ). QED-

DMFT gives the energy as a functional of a local one-body 4 × 4 matrix

Q(x) ≡ −hψ(x) ¯ψ(x)i, where ψ and ¯ψ are 4-component Dirac ﬁeld and its

Dirac conjugate, respectively. We examine some characters of QED-DMFT.

After these preparations, by using Q(x), we classify the solutions of QED-

DMFT under O(3) rotation, time reversal and spatial inversion. The behavior

of Q(x) under nonrelativistic and ultrarelativistic limits are also presented.

Finally, we give plans for several extensions and applications of QED-DMFT.

I. INTRODUCTION

The density matrix was ﬁrst introduced by Dirac [1], and after it was generalized by

Husimi [2] and L¨owdin [3] ( the reduced density matrix ). This was recognized as a very useful

tool to investigate interacting many-body theory, and it gave various important concepts

until now. The deﬁnition of the one-particle density matrix is given as

γ(x, x′)αβ = hψ†

β(x′)ψα(x)i.

(1)

Here ψ and ψ† are 2-component electron ﬁeld and its hermitian conjugate, respectively.

On the other hand, the density functional theory ( DFT ) was ﬁrst given by Hohenberg-

Kohn-Sham [4], and it was developed by many researchers. People applied DFT to various

many-fermion systems, not only many-electron systems like atoms, molecules and solids, but

also nuclear systems. Today, DFT is well accepted, and used to investigate various physical

and chemical characters of systems [5∼7].

The symmetry aspect of DFT was also discussed by using the one-particle local 2 × 2

matrix density:

ρ(x)αβ = hψ†

β(x)ψα(x)i.

(2)

By using (2), G¨orling examined the symmetry of the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem in de-

tail [8]. Weiner and Trickey investigated the group theoretical classiﬁcation of nonrela-

tivistic DFT solutions [9], based on the work of Fukutome in which the classiﬁcation for

generalized Hartree-Fock ( GHF ) theory was presented [10]. Yamanaka et al. [11] ap-

plied the generalized spin orbital ( GSO ) DFT to various molecular systems and studied

the symmetry breaking phenomena in DFT solutions. We should mention also, it was

demonstrated that the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem varid for one-particle density matrix func-

tional E[γ(x, x′)] [12∼15]. DFT for time-dependent phenomena was also investigated ( the

2

time-dependent density functional theory ( TDDFT ) ). Runge and Gross examined the

Hohenberg-Kohn theorem for time-dependent external potential ( the Runge-Gross theorem

) [16]. TDDFT was applied to estimation of electronic excitation or susceptibilities [17].

By the way, the ﬁrst generalization of relativistic Hohenberg-Kohn theorem was intro-

duced by Rajagopal-Callaway [18], and several attempts were made to investigate relativistic

density functional theory ( RDFT ) [19∼24]. Based on these studies, an important review

of RDFT was presented by Eschrig et al. [25]. Today, the Hohenberg-Kohn-Sham scheme is

well established for RDFT [26∼28]. Relativistic time-dependent density functional theory (

RTDDFT ) was also investigated [29,30].

In this note we investigate quantum electrodynamical density-matrix functional theory

( QED-DMFT ), and its group theoretical aspects. Recently, we constructed the theory of

quantum electrodynamical self-consistent ﬁelds ( QED-SCF ) [31]. We derived the time-

dependent Hartree-Fock ( QED-TDHF ) theory, Hartree-Fock condition and random phase

approximation ( QED-RPA ). We also presented the group theoretical classiﬁcation of quan-

tum electrodynamical Hartree-Fock ( QED-HF ) solutions [32]. Based on our previous re-

sults, in this work we apply the group-theoretical method to QED-DMFT. Our theory can

become a basis or a starting point to investigate the phenomena of symmetry breaking in

many-body system [9∼11,33] under strong relativistic eﬀects, by using DFT framework. In

the work of Yamanaka et al. [11], the results indicate that the GSO treatment of DFT is very

important and usuful for description of some polyradical clusters. Therefore, it is interesting

for us to extend their treatment to the relativistic framework, and study the phenomena of

symmetry breaking in heavy elements, analogous with the nonrelativistic GHF theory [10].

This paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we introduce QED-DMFT. Here, “matrix”

means a matrix in spinor space. In fact, we do not use a non-local one-body matrix like

γ(x, x′)αβ in nonrelativistic case, rather we intend to discuss a local one-body matrix like

ρ(x)αβ in nonrelativistic case for obtaining simple classiﬁcation under group operations.

The relation between various available DFT and QED-DMFT is also discussed. Quantum

electrodynamical time-dependent density-matrix functional theory ( QED-TDDMFT ) is

3

also investigated. In Sec. III, the group theoretical classiﬁcation of QED-DMFT solutions

is discussed. The results can be applied to elucidate the phenomena of broken symmetry,

especially in atomic systems under relativistic eﬀects. Finally in Sec. IV, possible extensions

and applications of QED-DMFT are discussed. Conclusion with summary of this work is

also presented.

II. QED-DMFT

A. Introduction for QED-DMFT

In this subsection, we introduce QED-DMFT. First, we give a brief summary of QED.

We start from the following Lagrangian:

L(x) = −

Fµν(x)F µν(x) + ¯ψ(x)(iγµ∂µ − m0)ψ(x) + e ¯ψ(x)γµψ(x)(Aµ(x) + Aext

µ (x)).

(3)

Here, Aµ is a ( virtual ) photon ﬁeld which describes the interaction between fermions, and

Aext
µ

is a classical external ﬁeld. Fµν(x) = ∂µAν(x) − ∂νAµ(x). m0 is the bare mass of

fermion, ψ(x) is the Dirac ﬁeld, ¯ψ(x) is its Dirac conjugate. x ≡ (x0, x) indicates time-space

coordinate. The γ-matrices are deﬁned by ( under the standard representation )

γ0 =

where I is the unit matrix, and σi ( i=1,2,3 ) is the Pauli matrix:

The Hamiltonian for a QED system becomes

is a classical ﬁeld, while others are quantized. ˆHem is a Hamiltonian for electro-

magnetic ﬁeld. If we descibe the interaction between fermions by using a photon propagator,

we get

Here, Dµν(x − y) is a full photon propagator. Quantized fermion-ﬁeld operators ˆψ(x) and
ˆ¯ψ(x) can be expanded by one-particle state functions as

ˆψ(x) =

(ψ(+)

where +(−) means the electron ( positron ) state, i denotes quantum numbers for one-

particle state, ˆa†

i (ˆai) is electron creation ( annihilation ) operator, ˆb†

i (ˆbi) is positron creation

( annihilation ) operator, and ψ(±)

i

is the four-component bispinor given like

ψ(±)
i = (f (±)

i(1) , f (±)

i(2) , f (±)

i(3) , f (±)

i(4) )T ,

where, T indicates the transposition of a matrix.

After these preliminaries given above, we investigate the QED-DMFT. For our aim, ﬁrst

we introduce the one-particle local density matrix:

Q(x)4×4 = −hψ(x) ¯ψ(x)i4×4.

Here ψ and ¯ψ are usual Dirac ﬁeld, and they are 4-component bispinors. Thus our density

matrix is 4×4 matrix, as denoted above. We can expand the 4×4 density matrix into the

16-dimensional complete set of γ-matrices:

Q4×4 =

ΓAQA = QSI + QV

µ γµ + QT

µνσµν + QA

µ γ5γµ + QP iγ5,

(13)

In this expansion, we take a convention as S denotes the scalar, V denotes the vector, T

denotes the 2-rank antisymmetric tensor, A denotes the axial vector and P denotes the

pseudoscalar. I is the 4 × 4 unit-matrix, γµ is usual Dirac gamma matrix, σµν is deﬁned as

QV

σµν = i

matrix Q. Each component of the expansion in (12) is given as follows: QS = 1

2[γµ, γν], and γ5 = iγ0γ1γ2γ3. Hence we obtain the Lorentz structure in our density
4h ¯ψψi,
4trQ = 1
4 h ¯ψγµψi, QT
4 h ¯ψγ5γµψi and
4h ¯ψσµνψi, QA
4 h ¯ψiγ5ψi. Therefore, Q(x) includes a larger amount of informations than
4-current jµ(x) = −eh ¯ψ(x)γµψ(x)i. It is clear from the discussion given above, if Q(x) is

4 trγµQ = 1
4triγ5Q = 1

4trγ5γµQ = 1

4trσµνQ = 1

QP = 1

µν = 1

µ = 1

µ = 1

given, then jµ(x) and also other components can be calculated.

The Rayleigh-Ritz variation principle of QED-DMFT should be given rather straightfor-

ward extension of available theory, like the situation of the generalization of the Hohenberg-

Kohn theorem to 4-current RDFT [7,14,18,25,26]. The exact energy functional of N-

representable Q(x) for ground state of a QED system ( Strictly spearking, the particle

number N is not conserved in QED, but the total charge is conserved, as denoted in (15).

) is given in the following form:

E[Q(x)] = hΨQ| ˆH ′|ΨQi

= F [Q(x)] +

Z

d3xjµ(x)Aext

µ (x).

(14)

(15)

Here, we use the Hamiltonian ˆH ′ given in (7). Now Aext

µ (x) is a static external ﬁeld. Here

we only consider a stationary problem. Variational search of the minimum point of the

functional should be performed under constraint:

∂µjµ(x) = 0,

d3xj0(x) = const.

Z

First equation is arised from the gauge invariance of the theory derived by N¨other theorem,

while second one expresses the charge conservation. The fundamental theorems of DFT

proved by Levy are constructed by two points [14]: (i) The variation principle can be applied

to the ground state energy functional E[ρ(x)] or E[γ(x, x′)], where ρ(x) is the one-particle

density while γ(x, x′) is the one-particle ( so called ﬁrst-order ) density matrix. (ii) The

6

ground state of a system can be represented by ρ(x) or γ(x, x′) for ground state ( ρGS(x) or

γGS(x, x′) ). It is clear from his logic, the theorems do not distinguish between nonrelativistic

case and relativistic case, and can be applied to relativistic case. Therefore, we argue that

our functional E[Q(x)] will obey the variation principle and Q(x) for the ground state (

QGS(x) ) represents the ground state of a QED system. Thus

where ˆT is the kinetic energy while ˆVf −f is the interaction between fermions, presented in

Next step of our plan is the investigation into the Kohn-Sham scheme in our theory. The

¯ψn(−i~γ · ∇ + m0)ψn,

and the 4-current jµ(x) is given as

jµ(x) = −e

¯ψn(x)γµψn(x),

X−m<ǫn≤ǫF

where, ψn is the Kohn-Sham one-body function in our theory. EXC[Q(x)] is the exchange-

correlation energy functional in our theory. The deﬁnition of EXC[Q(x)] is given as

EXC[Q(x)] = F [Q(x)] − Ts[Q(x)] −

The third term of the right hand side of (18) is a Hartree-like term. This term arises if we

replace Dµν(x − y) of (7) to the 0-th order photon propagator of the Feynman gauge:

D(0)

(22)

Here gµν is usual metric tensor and deﬁned as gµν = diag(1, −1, −1, −1). Therefore, the third

term of (18) includes gauge parameter. EXC has to include contributions to compensate the

gauge dependence of the Hartree-like term, for retaining the gauge invariance of the theory.

From the variation with respect to the one-particle function, we obtain the Dirac-Kohn-Sham

equation in our theory:

Because our energy functional depends on the matrix Q(x), generally we obtain 16-

component ﬁctitious potentials. From the symmetry consideration, it is clear that, scalar

potential vS gives the mass correction δm, which will arises from radiative corrections. vV
µ

appears also in usual 4-current RDFT [7,26]. In fact, QED-DMFT is a non-perturbative

method in QED. It is a famous fact that, QED becomes ﬁnite if its calculation fulﬁlls the

requirement of the gauge invariance [34] ( though we should employ gauge-invariant regu-

larization and renormalization ). Therefore, if we can perform a calculation under retaining

gauge invariance exactly, we will obtain a ﬁnite value for QED-DMFT.

B. Relations between various DFT Schemes

Now, we discuss the relation between various DFT, as depicted in Fig. 1. If we take

into account only the components of 4-current jµ in the expansion (12) of Q(x) for QED-

DMFT energy functional, we obtain quantum electrodynamical current density functional

8

spatial components of current j(x) = I + 1

theory ( QED-CDFT ) [7,25,26]. Next, under performing the Gordon decomposition to
2m{ ¯ψ∇ψ − (∇ ¯ψ)ψ} is the
¯ψγ5γ0~γψ is the spin density ), and then completely omit

m∇ × S ( here I = i

orbital current density while S = 1
2

I, we obtain relativistic spin density functional theory ( RSDFT ) [25,28]. Next, neglect

the contribution of S for RSDFT, then we obtain relativistic density functional theory (

RDFT ). Performing some nonrelativistic reduction, especially only take into account the

contribution of the large component to RDFT, and neglect all relativistic corrections ( spin-

orbit, Darwin, mass-velocity etc. ), then we obtain nonrelativistic density functional theory (

NRDFT ) [5∼7]. Generalizing the NRDFT to spin polarized system, we get nonrelativistic

spin density functional theory ( NRSDFT ) [5∼7]. Add the interaction between orbital

current and external vector potential Aext to NRSDFT, we obtain nonrelativistic current

density functional theory ( NRCDFT ) [35].

Extension of QED-DMFT to the time-dependent region can also be considered. Starting

point here is the action integral for density functional, like the QED-TDHF [31]:

S[Q] =

dthΨQ(t)|i

− ˆH ′|ΨQ(t)i.

(29)

Here matrix Q(x) = Q(x0, x), depends on time x0. H ′ is given as (7). We take the

Dirac-Frenkel variation principle to produce a stationary point at time-dependent density

Q(x) [17,31]:

δS[Q] = δ

dthΨQ(t)|i

− ˆH ′|ΨQ(t)i = 0.

Therefore we obtain the Euler equation:

δS[Q]
δQA(x0, x)

= 0,

A = 1 ∼ 16.

(30)

(31)

The Hohenberg-Kohn theorem in time-dependent potential was discussed by Runge-

Gross [16,17] for nonrelativistic case, and it was extended by Rajagopal [30] for relativistic

case, in detail. In fact, we simply assume that our functional of Q can be used to discuss

variation principle parallel with their results.

The time-dependent Dirac-Kohn-Sham equation in our theory becomes

III. GROUP THEORETICAL CLASSIFICATION OF QED-DMFT SOLUTIONS

A. Group theoretical Classiﬁcation

In this section, we give a discussion of group theoretical classiﬁcation of the QED-DMFT

solutions.

In the relativistic theory, we usually treat the Poincar´e group ( 4-translation and the

Lorentz group ), charge conjugation, parity ( spatial inversion ) and time-reversal. Under

the charge conjugation, ψ and ¯ψ are transformed as

ψ → C ¯ψT ,

¯ψ → −ψT C −1,

(38)

where T denotes the transposition of a matrix, C ≡ iγ2γ0 is the charge conjugation matrix.

Then Q(x) is transformed as

10

Q = −hψ ¯ψi → −Chψ ¯ψiT C −1 = CQT C −1

= QSI − QV

µ γµ − QT

µνσµν + QA

µ γ5γµ + QP iγ5.

Under the time reversal,

ψ(t) → T ψ(−t),

¯ψ(t) → ¯ψ(−t)T.

(39)

(40)

Here T ≡ iγ1γ3. Then, together with the rule of taking the complex conjugate about

c-numbers, we obtain

Q(t) = −hψ(t) ¯ψ(t)i → −T hψ(−t) ¯ψ(−t)i∗T = T Q(−t)∗T

= QS∗(−t)I + QV ∗

0 (−t)γ0 − QV ∗(−t) · ~γ + QT ∗

0i (−t)σ0i

−QT ∗

ij (−t)σij + QA∗

0 (−t)γ5γ0 − QA∗(−t) · γ5~γ − QP ∗(−t)iγ5,

(41)

where i, j = 1, 2, 3. QV

0 is 0-th component of vector while QA

0 is 0-th component of axial

vector. QV and QA are space components of vector and axial vector, respectively. Under

ψ(x) → γ0ψ(−x),

¯ψ(x) → ¯ψ(−x)γ0,

(42)

the spatial inversion,

Q(x) is transformed as

Q(x) = −hψ(x) ¯ψ(x)i → −γ0hψ(−x) ¯ψ(−x)iγ0 = γ0Q(−x)γ0

= QS(−x)I + QV

0 (−x)γ0 − QV (−x) · ~γ − QT

0i(−x)σ0i

+QT

ij(−x)σij − QA

0 (−x)γ5γ0 + QA(−x) · γ5~γ − QP (−x)iγ5.

(43)

The QED-DMFT solutions can be group theoretically classiﬁed into several types. To

consider this problem, we determine the symmetry group of a system.

In the atomic or

molecular systems, the translation invariance is broken. In the case of an atom, only O(3)

rotation remains in the Lorentz group ( In the case of a molecule, O(3) is replaced by

the point group.

). Under the O(3) rotational symmetry, we expand the QS, QP , QV
0

and QA

0 by the scalar spherical harmonics, while we expand the QV , QA and QT

µν by the

11

vector spherical harmonics [36]. It is clear from (41) and (43), the behavior of each type of

the density matrix given in (12) under the spatial inversion and time reversal depends not

only on the structure of the γ-matrix, but also on the angular momentum of the spherical

harmonics. Let us consider the case of an atom. We treat the group G = O(3) × P × T . We

introduce the subgroup of G as

(44)

(45)

(46)

O(3) × P × T, O(3) × P, O(3) × T,

P × T, O(3), P, T,

1.

For example, O(3) × P × T -invariant solution is given as

QS∗ = QS, QV ∗

0 = QV
0 ,

others = 0.

There is no case for O(3) × P -invariant solution. O(3) × T -invariant solution is given as

QS∗ = QS, QV ∗

0 = QV

0 , QA∗

0 = QA
0 ,

others = 0.

O(3)-invariant solution is given as

QS∗ = QS, QV ∗

0 = QV

0 , QA∗

0 = QA

0 , QP ∗ = QP ,

others = 0.

(47)

Due to the O(3) rotational invariance, each density matrix can only have an s-wave compo-

nent in all cases (45)∼(47). All solutions given above are the cases for closed shell states.

We may have magnetic QED-DMFT solutions for systems under discussions, if time reversal

symmetry is broken ( for example, the case of (47) ).

Under the presence of the vectorial density matrices like the QV , QA and QT

µν, the O(3)

rotational symmetry will be broken. For P × T -, P -, T - and 1- (no symmetry) invariant

solutions, simple classiﬁcation is impossible, because there are various possibilities of the

angular momentum dependences of Q. This situation demands us futher investigation in

more detail in the future. It must be noted that we have to solve the Dirac-Kohn-Sham

equation to ﬁnd which type of the density matrices ( and solutions ) will be realized.

B. Nonrelativistic and Ultrarelativistic Limits

To consider the nonrelativistic and ultrarelativistic limits, we take the standard repre-

sentation. The four component bispinor ψ is partitioned as [36]

ψ =

IV. DISCUSSION

In this paper, we have investigated the QED-DMFT and the group theoretical classiﬁ-

cation of its solutions. We have introduced the one-particle local density matrix Q(x), and

have decomposed by using γ-matrices. We have discussed the transformation properties of

the matrix under group operations, and its nonrelativistic limit.

Now, we discuss the application and extension of our theory.

In the context of the electronic structure of atoms, there are three eﬀects: The electron

correlation, the relativistic eﬀect and the QED eﬀect. The electronic structure of atoms is

determined by the relation of these three factors. The electron correlation depends on the

electron numbers and can be treated by several many-body techniques. The relativistic eﬀect

( kinematic eﬀect, spin-orbit, Darwin, mass-velocity, etc. ) becomes large with increasing

the atomic number. On the other hand, the case to describe the inner core electrons of

heavy elements or, electrons of highly ionized heavy elements such as lithium-like uranium,

the QED eﬀect ( mainly originate in negative energy state ) can not be neglected and we must

take the Dirac sea into account. In the case of heavy atoms, as the ionicity becomes high

and the electron number decrease, the many-body eﬀect becomes small and the QED eﬀect

becomes large. In principle, QED-DMFT can exactly estimate the three eﬀects discussed

above. Therefore we propose that QED-DMFT should be applied to the cases where both

the many-body eﬀects and the QED eﬀects can not be neglected. Practically, we need a

well-behaved exchange-correlation functional which contains both the correlation energy and

QED eﬀect satisfactorily. Heavy elements in middle level of ionicity should be one of the

subject for our theory. The calculation of electromagnetic properties, for example, g-factors,

hyperﬁne interactions, nuclear magnetic resonance shielding constants, are interesting. The

collision of two uranium atoms is also one of the interesting subject of QED-TDDMFT. QED-

TDDMFT should be useful to describe excitations, susceptibilities and collective modes of

systems. Recently, experiments of x-ray irradiation to cluster plasma are performed, and

verious new phenomena were studied [37]. The cluster of heavy ions under middle revel of

14

ionicity is now an interesting subject in this area. The importance of the relativistic and

QED eﬀects is discussed in such objects.

It is a famous fact that, the available exchange-correlation functionals only describe

the dynamic correlations reliably, and they fails for systems with strong static correlations.

Thus, usual Kohn-Sham scheme often breaks down in the case of near degenerate ground

states. In the usual method of quantum chemistry, the static correlation should be described

by using multi-determinantal wavefunctions. The CASSCF is one of the methods to take

into account the static correlation eﬀect correctly. Recently, the CAS-DFT method was

proposed [38]. In this method, the dynamic correlation is considered by usual DFT scheme,

while static correlation is handled by CAS-type wavefunction. The energy functional is given

as

E[ρ] = min

F [ρ] +

ρ→Nn
KS [ρ] + ECAS
F [ρ] = F CAS

C

Z

[ρ],

d3xρ(x)v(x)

,

o

F CAS

KS [ρ] = min

ΨCAS →ρ

hΨCAS| ˆT + ˆVee|ΨCASi,

where ˆT and ˆVee are the kinetic energy and electron-electron interaction, respectively. ΨCAS

is a CAS trial wavefunction. In the scheme given above, exchange energy and static cor-

relation energy are covered by F CAS

KS , while ECAS

C

includes the dynamic correlation energy

only. CAS-DFT in nonrelativistic case gives accurate results [38]. Thus we propose that

this method can be extended to the relativistic theory, and should become usuful tool to

consider near degeneracy eﬀect in relativistic DFT framework. For this aim, we introduce

the density matrix which is deﬁned as

ρ++
ij

ρ+−
ij

ρ−+
ij

ρ−−
ij





i |ΦGSi hΦGS|ˆbjˆb†
ˆb†

i |ΦGSi

,







Then we diagonalize the density matrix, we obtain the natural orbital given by four-

component bispinor η(±)

i

and ni as its occupation number. By using the occupation number

ni, we can select the active space for treatments of the near degeneracy eﬀects [39]. The

15

natural orbital analysis of a resulted solution is useful to elucidate the type and magnitude

of broken symmetry.

It is also interesting for us to use the information entropy to measure the electron corre-

lation in various systems [40]. For example, Shannon entropy

or Jaynes entropy

conjecture:

SShannon(ρ) = −

d3xρ(x) ln ρ(x),

Z

SJaynes = −

ni ln ni,

Xi

Ecorr = −k

ni ln ni ∝ SJaynes.

Xi

might be useful tools. The electron correlation energy can be estimated based on the Collins’s

(61)

(62)

(63)

Therefore, by using these entropies, we propose to estimate the strength of the electron cor-

relation in various atoms under various ionicities with QED-DMFT. The relations between

various theories proposed in this paper are depicted in Fig. 2.

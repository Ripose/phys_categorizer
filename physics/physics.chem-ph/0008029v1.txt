Discrete solvent eﬀects on the eﬀective interaction between charged colloids

Using computer simulations of two charged colloidal spheres with their counterions in a hard sphere
solvent, we show that the granular nature of the solvent signiﬁcantly inﬂuences the eﬀective colloidal
interaction. For divalent counterions, the total eﬀective force can become attractive generated by
counterion hydration, while for monovalent counterions the forces are repulsive and well-described by
a solvent-induced colloidal charge renormalization. Both eﬀects are not contained in the traditional
“primitive” approaches but can be accounted for in a solvent-averaged primitive model.

PACS: 82.70.Dd, 61.20.Ja

Supramolecular aggregates, such as colloids, polymers
or biological macromolecules, are typically suspended in
a molecular solvent which guarantees their stability and
profoundly inﬂuences their viscoelastic properties [1]: ex-
amples range from paints to dense DNA-solutions in bi-
ological cells. A full “ab initio” statistical description
of supramolecular solutions should start from a molecu-
lar scale including the solvent explicitly. Obviously this
is a tremendous task due to the large length scale sep-
aration between the microscopic solvent and the meso-
scopic solute and the enormous number of solvent par-
ticles which have to be considered explicitly. Therefore,
most of the common statistical approaches are based on
so-called “primitive” models insofar as they disregard the
molecular nature of the solvent completely such that sol-
vent properties only enter via a continuous background.
A particular example for such a separation of length
scales are charged colloidal suspensions [2] consisting of
highly charged mesoscopic particles (so-called polyions)
suspended in water or any other organic solvent together
with their oppositely charged microscopic counterions.
The key quantity to understand the stability, structure
and dynamics of such colloidal dispersions is the eﬀec-
tive interaction between two polyions, as a function of
their mutual distance r. Neglecting the discrete sol-
vent this quantity has been calculated using modeling
on diﬀerent descending levels: i) the “primitive model”
(PM) of strongly asymmetric electrolytes which takes
into account explicitly the counterions ii) the nonlin-
ear Poisson-Boltzmann approach which is inferior to the
PM as it neglects counterion correlations, iii) the lin-
earized screening theory resulting in a Yukawa form for
the eﬀective interaction potential as given by the electro-
static part of the celebrated Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-
Overbeek (DLVO) theory [3]. The main eﬀects of non-
linear Poisson-Boltzmann theory can be encaptured by
a similar Yukawa potential but with “renormalized” pa-
rameters leading to the concept of colloidal charge renor-
malization [4]. This picture is consistent with experimen-
tal data in dilute bulk solutions with monovalent counte-
rions [5,6]. Very strong correlations between divalent and
trivalent counterions, however, may lead to attractive ef-
fective forces between like-charge polyions as shown in

recent computer simulations of the PM [7–9].

FIG. 1. View of the set-up as a projection of a simula-
tion snapshot: Two polyions (dark open circles) in a bath of
solvent particles (small hollow spheres) contained in a sphe-
rocylindric cell of width h. The counterions shown as small
dark spheres can move in the whole simulation box of size L.

In this Letter, we investigate the inﬂuence of solvent
granularity on the eﬀective interactions between charged
colloids. We explicitly add to the PM a molecular solvent
modelled by a hard sphere ﬂuid. We study this model by
direct computer simulation and use the concept of eﬀec-
tive interactions to overbridge the gap between micro-
scopic and mesoscopic length scales. Our motivation to
do so is twofold: First, although the dipolar nature of the
solvent [10] is not included, the model provides a minimal
framework towards a statistical description of hydration
forces. Second, the solvent hard sphere model was con-
sidered in earlier studies for the eﬀective interaction be-
tween charged plates using liquid integral equations [11],
modiﬁed Poisson-Boltzmann theory [12] or more sophis-
ticated density functional approaches [13]. All these de-
scriptions, however, suﬀer from additional uncontrolled

approximations such that “exact” computer simulation
results are highly desirable. Such simulations were per-
formed for parallel plates [14] and for small neutral par-
ticles [15] but are hitherto not available for spherical
charged colloids.

We implement a new “solvent bath” simulation scheme
which allows to simulate many neutral spheres together
with the charged species and obtain explicit results for
the eﬀective force between nano-sized highly charged col-
loids. We use these data to test a theory with solvent-
averaged eﬀective interactions between the charged parti-
cles similar in spirit to the old McMillan-Mayer approach
for electrolyte solutions [16]. This solvent-averaged prim-
itive model (SPM) yields good agreement with the sim-
ulation data and can thus be used to obtain the eﬀec-
tive interaction between larger colloidal particles. For
monovalent counterions and large distances r, our simu-
lation data can be described perfectly within a Yukawa-
potential with a solvent-induced polyion charge and
screening length renormalization. For divalent counte-
rions and nano-sized colloids, we ﬁnd an attractive force.
Both eﬀects are not contained in the PM.

We consider two large spherical polyions with diame-
ter σp and charge qp at distance r, together with their
counterions of diameter σc and charge qc in a bath of a
neutral solvent (qs = 0) with diameter σs. In our model,
the pair potentials between the particles as a function
of the mutual distances r are a combination of excluded
volume and Coulomb terms

where ǫ is the a smeared background dielectric constant
of the solvent and (ij) = (pp), (pc), (ps), (cc), (cs), (ss).
Further parameters are the thermal energy kBT and the
(i = p, c, s) which can be
partial number densities ρi
expressed as partial volume fractions φi = πρiσ3
i /6 (i =
p, c, s). Charge neutrality requires ρp|qp| = ρc|qc|. We ﬁx
the two polyions along the body diagonal in a cubic simu-
lation box of length L with periodic boundary conditions,
hence ρp = 2/L3.
In a dense ﬂuid solvent (φs ≈ 0.3),
many solvent spheres are in the box, such that a direct
simulation is impossible. Thus we resort to the following
“solvent-bath” procedure: we deﬁne a spherocylindrical
cell around the colloidal pair such that the minimal dis-
tance h from the colloidal surface to the cell boundary
is larger than the hard sphere bulk correlation length ξ,
see Figure 1 for the set-up. The hard sphere solvent is
only contained in this spherocylinder while the counteri-
ons can move within the whole simulation box. We use
the Molecular Dynamics (MD) method to calculate the
particle trajectories. Once a solvent particle is leaving
the spherocylindrical cell, it is randomly inserted at an-
other place of the cell boundary with the same velocity
and a random depth in order to avoid unphysical solvent
layering on the cell surface. Since h is much larger than
ξ, the presence of the boundary has no inﬂuence on the
inhomogeneous density distribution of the solvent and

the counterions near the colloidal surfaces. For a coun-
terion approaching the cell boundary, however, there is
an artiﬁcial asymmetry between the solvent bath inside
the cell and the “vacuum” outside the cell which hinders
a counterion to penetrate into the solvent bath. This
unphysical eﬀect is repaired in the simulation scheme
by switching oﬀ the counterion-solvent interaction for a
counterion which is penetrating from outside. Once the
counterion is fully surrounded by solvent molecules the
interaction is turned on again. This procedure guarantees
a symmetric crossing rate of counterions across the sphe-
rocylindrical cell.
In the solvent-free space outside the
cell, the counterion-counterion interaction is still Vcc(r)
as the mean counterion distance is much larger than ξ
such that the Coulomb repulsion dominates solvent de-
pletion eﬀects. The algorithm was carefully tested for
solvent slabs between charged plates and perfect agree-
ment was found compared to simulations where the whole
space was ﬁlled with solvent particles.

In our simulations, we ﬁxed T = 298oK and ǫ = 81
(water at room temperature) with σs = 3˚A, φs = 0.3
(such that ξ is about 3σs) and σc = 6˚A. The width h
is 12σs such that typically Ns = 25.000 − 30.000 solvent
hard spheres are simulated. We varied the polyion size σp
and charge qp and calculated the solvent- and counterion-
averaged total force acting onto a polyion for a given
colloidal distance r. The force is projected onto the sep-
aration vector of the two colloidal spheres such that a
positive sign means repulsion. This eﬀective force F (r)
is the sum of four diﬀerent contributions [7]: the direct
Coulomb repulsion as embodied in Vpp(r), the counterion
screening resulting from the averaged Coulomb force of
counterions acting onto the polyions, the counterion de-
pletion term arising from the hard sphere part of Vpc(r),
and the solvent depletion force.

For nano-sized colloids, explicit results for F (r) are
presented in Figures 2a and 2b. For nearly touching
polyions (full curves in the insets of Figs. 2a and 2b)
the force exhibits oscillations on the scale of the solvent
diameter due to solvent layering leading to attraction for
touching polyions as the attractive solvent depletion part
exceeds the bare Coulomb repulsion. For larger distances
and monovalent counterions, the force is repulsive. Sim-
ulation data for the PM are also included which overesti-
mate the force. The repulsion is even stronger in DLVO
theory as derived from the Yukawa pair potential

c /ǫkBT . For divalent counterions, on
the other hand, there is attraction within a range of sev-
eral polyion diameters. This attraction originates from
counterion overscreening induced by hydration, as the
pure PM yields repulsive forces.

Intermediate between the PM and the full solvent sim-

ulation, we put forward a description on the primitive

level with solvent-averaged interactions between the
charged particles which provides a simple physical pic-
ture of discrete solvent eﬀects. In fact, by tracing out the
solvent degrees of freedom exactly, one arrives at addi-
tional solvent-induced interactions on the primitive level
for which we approximately only consider pairwise terms.
This deﬁnes the solvent-averaged primitive model (SPM).
The additional depletion interactions in hard sphere mix-
tures have been studied extensively by theory [17] and
simulation [18]. The polyion-polyion solvent-induced de-
pletion force is also included in Figure 2 exhibiting os-
cillations on the scale of the molecular solvent diameter
σs. While the additional solvent-averaged counterion-
counterion interaction is much smaller than the Coulomb
repulsion, the solvent-averaged polyion-counterion inter-
action results in a deep counterion attraction towards
the colloidal surfaces with a molecular range and a po-
tential energy depth of several kBT , describing granular
hydration forces. The only approximation used to derive
the SPM is that solvent-induced many-body forces be-
tween the charged particles are ignored. This is justiﬁed
as typical distances between triplets of charged particles
are larger than ξ except for nearly touching polyions with
“squeezed” counterions. We determine the additional de-
pletion interaction of the SPM by a reference simulation
of two spheres in a hard sphere solvent [18] and use them
as an input for a simulation of the SPM. As can be
deduced from Figure 2, the SPM describes the solvent
bath data extremely well, yielding results that lie within
the statistical error of the full simulation over the whole
range of distances.

We ﬁnally use the SPM to investigate solvent eﬀects for

polyion sizes in the colloidal domain. Distance-resolved
colloidal forces F (r) for monovalent counterions are pre-
sented in Figure 3. These forces are repulsive but much
smaller than those from PM simulations or DLVO the-
ory. This is due to counterion accumulation near the
colloidal surface as induced by the additional solvent de-
pletion attraction. As the corresponding potential energy
gain is only few kBT , this depletion attraction is diﬀer-
ent from chemisorption of counterions. For very large
distances, on the other hand, the screening of the re-
maining free counterions will dominate the interaction
which can be described by a cell model [4]. To test
this, we have performed additional solvent-bath simu-
lations for a single polyion in a spherical cell of radius
R = (4πρp/3)−1/3 calculating the counterion density
˜ρc at the cell boundary. The corresponding eﬀective
Yukawa potential has the same form as in eq.(2) but with

a solvent-renormalized screening length κ∗ = κp˜ρc/ρc

and a solvent-renormalized charge q∗
p = qp ˜ρc/ρc which
is considerably smaller than the bare charge. The ac-
tual value of this renormalized charge, however, diﬀers
strongly from the charge renormalization according to
the PM or Poisson Boltzmann theory [4]. The force re-
sulting from the solvent-renormalized Yukawa model ﬁts
our full simulation data of nano-sized colloids for large
distances and monovalent counterions (see Figure 2a)
and perfectly describes the SPM data for larger colloids
except for molecular distances (see Figure 3). Conse-
quently, a Yukawa model can still be used but the pa-
rameters have to be suitably renormalized. Clearly, the
repulsive Yukawa model breaks down if no free counteri-
ons are left as is the case for, e.g., divalent counterions

and monovalent counterions. The dot-dashed line here is the
PM with colloidal charge reduction by the corresponding av-
erage amount of counterions in a shell of width ξ around the
colloids. The meaning of the other lines is as in Figure 2a.

We ﬁnally remark that the traditional justiﬁcation of
the PM is to deﬁne a bare charge by ﬁxing all the coun-
terions which are in a molecular shell around the colloids
and to treat the rest within the PM. This picture of
polyion charge reduction works for chemisorption but not
for the weaker hydration forces. In fact, if the polyion
charge is reduced by the corresponding average counte-
rion charge in a shell of thickness of the solvent bulk
correlation length ξ, the PM still overestimates the force
considerably, see the dot-dashed line Figure 3.

In conclusion, based on a uniﬁed statistical description
of counterion hydration and screening, we have shown
that hydration forces profoundly inﬂuence the colloidal
interaction. For divalent counterions, there is solvent-
induced attraction which is not contained in the tradi-
tional primitive model but can be encaptured within a
solvent-averaged primitive model. For monovalent coun-
terions, the forces can be described by a charge renor-
malization induced by counterion hydration forces. This
picture is in agreement with experiments on strongly
deionized samples where a Yukawa picture can still be
employed, provided the colloidal charge is renormalized
towards a value smaller than the bare charge [5,19].
The general concept of charge renormalization should be
transferable to other situations where screening by few
remaining “free” counterions dominates the interaction
as, e.g., for a polar solvent, for diﬀerent polyionic surface
charge patterns and for explicit surface chemistry.

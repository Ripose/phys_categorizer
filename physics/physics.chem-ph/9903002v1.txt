Electronic Structure of a Chemisorbed Layer at Electrochemical
Interface : Copper Layer on Gold Electrode

ABSTRACT

Though the importance of chemisorption at the electrochemical interface is well recognized,

an electronic level description for the same still remains in a nascent stage. The present

work speciﬁcally addresses this problem. An appropriate model Hamiltonian based formal-

ism is proposed for a random adsorbate layer with arbitrary coverage and the ensuing two-

dimensional band formation by metallic adsorbates in the monolayer regime. The coherent

potential approximation is employed to handle the randomness. The adsorbate self-energy is

evaluated explicitly using the density of states for the substrate band. This takes us beyond

the conventional wide-band approximation and removes the logarithmic divergence associ-

ated with the binding energy calculations. The formalism is applied to the electrosorption of

copper ion on gold electrode, and the coverage dependence of adsorbate charge, binding en-

ergy, and adsorbate density of states are determined. The analysis predicts a unique charge

conﬁguration of copper adsorbate, having a net positive charge, in the high-coverage regime,

and multiple charge states when the coverage is low. Though one of the charge conﬁgurations

of copper is nearly neutral at small coverage, its positive charge state is the most stable in

the entire coverage range. The transition from the relative neutral state of copper at low cov-

erage to a positive charge conﬁguration occurs sharply at the intermediate-coverage region.

This transition is caused due to the progressive desolvation of copper adion with increasing

coverage. The energy calculations show that copper s-orbital bonding contributes maximally

towards the binding energy at the metal-vacuum interface, whereas it is the copper d-orbital

bonding which makes chemisorption feasible at the gold electrode. Finally, our numerical

results are compared with the relevant experimental studies.

1 Introduction

Chemisorbed species signiﬁcantly modify the physico-chemical nature of an electrochemi-

cal interface [1-3]. In spite of their importance in the areas of heterogeneous electron-transfer

reactions, catalysis, chemically modiﬁed electrodes, and double layer studies, an electronic

level description of the electrosorption phenomenon is still elusive. However, the recent

progress concerning in situ structure-sensitive techniques has made it possible to obtain the

structural details of an adlayer in an electrochemical environment. In the present paper, we

investigate the electronic states of a random adsorbate layer. To understand the similari-

ties, as well as the critical diﬀerences between the chemisorption at the metal-vacuum and

electrochemical interface, is the other motivation for undertaking this study.

In our studies, the adsorbate coverage factor θ is allowed to take any arbitrary value in the

range (0, 1). Thus the formalism remains valid all the way up to a monolayer regime, starting

with a single adsorbate case. The analysis ultimately leads to the quantitative estimates of (i)

average “occupation probability” and the “partial charge-transfer coeﬃcient” of adsorbate,

(ii) its density of states, and (iii) binding energy. The formalism also enables one to study

how these quantities are aﬀected due to coverage variation.

Electrochemisorbed copper on gold electrode represents a model experimental system,

studied extensively through various structure-sensitive techniques [4-7]. Besides, this is also

typical of the underpotential deposition phenomenon [8-10]. Double layer studies coupled

with the thermodynamic analysis suggest that a copper adsorbed on gold electrode exists in

a neutral state when the coverage is low [11,12]. On the other hand, Tadjeddine et al. have

shown through in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy of copper layer on gold(111) electrode
surface that in the monolayer regime, the charge state of Cu adsorbate is close to Cu+ [6].

These studies show a large variation in copper adatom charge with increasing coverage. It

will be pertinent here to restate that the electronic structure of a metallic adsorbate dif-

fers signiﬁcantly in the low and higher coverage domains. In the former case, the electrons

are essentially localized on the adatom whereas with increasing coverage, they tend to get

delocalized over a large spatial region. These extended electronic states ultimately form a

two-dimensional band in the monolayer regime. We have applied our general formalism to

Cu/Au system. Our theoretical results are in conformity with the Tadjeddine et al. exper-

imental observation of a positively charged copper adsorbate in the high coverage regime.

2

For the low-coverage domain, analysis shows the existence of three diﬀerent charge states

of a copper adsorbate. Though one of these states corresponds to a nearly neutral conﬁg-

uration of the copper, energetic considerations make this state a metastable one. Also the

transition from this neutral to a positive charge conﬁguration is not smooth, but occurs

discontinuously in the intermediate-coverage region. We show in sections 7 and 8 that the

progressive desolvation of a metallic adsorbate with increasing coverage is the main reason

behind this feature. The transition from multiple charge states of copper when coverage

θ is small to a single charge state for intermediate value of θ is speciﬁc to electrochemical

interface. This indicates that the chemisorption at the electrochemical and metal-vacuum

interface can be qualitatively diﬀerent, even when the adsorbate and substrate remain the

same. In the context of multiple charge states of copper, we also note that when the net

charge on an adsorbate at the electrochemical interface gets reduced, its solvation energy

decreases. This in turn shifts adsorbate’s energy toward a more positive value.

The present analysis employs, as the model Hamiltonian, a generalized version of the

Anderson-Newns Hamiltonian [13-16], which has been studied extensively in the context of

chemisorption at a metal-vacuum interface. The generalization considered here refers to

(i) modeling additional interactions which an adsorbate experiences at an electrochemical

interface, (ii) considering a collection of adspecies along with their mutual interactions,

instead of a lone adsorbate, and (iii) allowing a randomness in the occupancy status of

adsorption sites. Obviously the formalism considered here is also valid for the adsorption at

the metal-vacuum interface in the appropriate limiting conditions.

Kornyshev and Schmickler (KS) have earlier considered the coverage dependence of the

adsorbate charge using a generalization of Anderson-Newns Hamiltonian, and have applied

their formalism to study the adsorption of Cs and I at a mercury electrode [17]. The coverage

dependence in their analysis arises due to nonlocal electrostatic interactions between adions.

The present formalism diﬀers qualitatively from Kornyshev and Schmickler approach,

both at the levels of Hamiltonian (cf. section 2) and analysis.

In the KS formalism, the other adsorbates essentially introduce a static shift in the energy

level of an adatom. The quantum-mechanical aspect of the adlayer problem is still handled

within a “single-adsorbate” model. In contrast, the present formalism takes into account

the band structure of the metallic adlayer. Next, the KS approach is based on the wide-

band approximation which has been extensively employed to study the chemisorption at the

3

metal-vacuum (M-V) and electrode-electrolyte (E-E) interface. Herein, a part of adsorbate’s

self-energy arising due to the metal-adsorbate hybridization is approximated as an energy

independent quantity i∆. This approximation leads to a logarithmic divergence in the energy

calculation and necessitates an introduction of a lower cutoﬀ parameter in order to arrive

at a ﬁnite result [18]. Within the wide-band approximation, the adsorbate Green’s function

has a single pole structure (Lorentzian density of states) when the intraadsorbate Coulomb

repulsion is treated using the Hartree-Fock approximation.

We have gone beyond the wide-band approximation in the present formalism. The rele-

vant self-energy arising due to the electronic coupling between metal and adsorbate states is

explicitly evaluated employing model density of states for the substrate. This removes the

divergence in the energy calculation and, depending on the system parameters, allows the

adsorbate Green’s function to admit more than one pole even within the Hartree-Fock limit.

The self-energy now depends on the energy variable, and the adsorbate density of states may

exhibit non-Lorentzian structure.

In order to substantiate as well as compare our results with the wide-band limit based

formalism, we have suitably extended the latter to the context of random adsorbate layer

(sections 6 and 8).

In the next section, a model Hamiltonian describing the electrochemisorbed layer is con-

structed. The coherent potential approximation (CPA) scheme for the random adsorbate

layer is considered in section 3. The adsorbate density of states and other relevant quanti-

ties are evaluated in the next two sections. Analytic expressions suitable for the numerical

computations are derived in section 6 and the application of the formalism to the copper

adsorption on gold electrode is considered in section 7. Section 8 is devoted to discussion,

followed by section 9 on summary and concluding remarks.

2 The Model Hamiltonian

Chemisorbates forming a random layer over an electrode surface have extensive electronic

coupling with the substrate band states as well as with other adspecies. In addition, they

interact with the orientational, vibrational, and electronic polarization modes of a polar

liquid in the electrolyte phase. This leads to the solvation energy of the adsorbate. Similarly,

the coupling between the adsorbate and surface plasmons in the substrate is responsible for

the image energy contributions. The various solvent polarizations and surface plasmon modes

4

are described within the harmonic approximation, and their coupling with the adsorbates is

modeled as diagonal fermion-boson terms . Taking into account all the above interactions

along with the intraadsorbate Coulombic repulsion, a Hamiltonian for the electrochemisorbed

system is written as [16,17]

H =

k,σ ǫknkσ +

i,σ ˆǫiσ({bν + b†

(2.1)

The ﬁrst two terms describe the electronic states of electrode and the adsorbate layer.

ǫk and ˆǫiσniσ are the energy of kth electronic level in the substrate and the energy operator

for the site i in the two-dimensional adsorbate lattice. ˆǫiσ includes the contributions to

the adsorbate orbital energy due to its coupling to various boson branches, and from the
intraadsorbate coulomb repulsion U. c†

ℓ(cℓ) and nℓ are creation (annihilation) and number
operators for the quantum state ℓ . The set ({kσ}, {(iσ}) is assumed to form a complete

orthonormal set. The third term corresponds to the three polarization branches in the

solvent medium (ν = 1, 2, 3) and the surface plasmon in the substrate (ν = 4). The

next two entries describe the respective hopping terms between the sites on adsorbate layer

and substrate band states, and between the adsorbates in the two-dimensional lattice. The

coupling between the adsorbate core charge and the boson modes is represented by the last

term in eq 2.1. The U term here removes the double counting of the intraadsorbate repulsion.

{i} implies that the summation is over the sites occupied by the adsorbates.

At an electrochemical interface, the solvent layer adjacent to electrode is usually de-

scribed, to a ﬁrst approximation, as a structureless medium of dielectric constant 5.0 [19].

There is no charge transfer between the dielectric medium and the electrode. It only provides

the background in which the adsorbate lattice is embedded. The operator ˆǫiσ, when a site i

is occupied by an adsorbate, is [20]

ˆǫiσ({bν + b†

ν}, Uni¯σ) = Ea +

λiaν(bν + b†

ν) + Uni¯σ

(2.2)

where Ea is the adsorbate’s orbital energy in the vacuum.

4

ν=1
X

5

In case site i is unoccupied by an adsorbate, the expectation value of ˆǫiσ is given by the

relation

< ˆǫiσ >−→ ∞

(2.3)

This ensures no charge sharing between the electrode and vacant sites.

ˆǫiσ is therefore a random entity, giving rise to a diagonal randomness in the problem. All

other parameters, both diagonal and non-diagonal, are taken to be deterministic. They do

not depend on the occupancy status of the sites.

It is pertinent here to consider how a system described through the above Hamiltonian

diﬀers from the system studied by Krastov and Mal’shukov (KM) for the structural phase

transition in an adsorbate layer [21]. This clariﬁcation is also needed because the approach

used by KS to study the coverage dependence of the adsorbate charge at an electrochemical

interface [17] has a similarity with the KM formalism. Therefore, we mention the following

basic diﬀerences between the two approaches :

(i) We consider a random distribution of adsorbate on the 2D lattice. No such randomness

is inherent in KM formalism. We treat the randomness using the CPA approach. Being an

eﬀective medium theory, CPA averages out all the inhomogeneities in the system and provides

us with a description in which all the adsorption sites are equivalent; though the eﬀective

self-consistent site energy is now a function of energy variable (cf. section 3).

(ii) We model the direct interaction between adsorbate through the hopping term

i6=j,σ vijc†

iσcjσ.

This “one-body” interaction leads to the band structure of 2D adlayer (cf. section 3).
P

In contrast, the interadsorbate direct interaction is modeled in the KM analysis through a

“two-body” Coulomb term (1/2)

i6=j U ˆniˆnj describing the electrostatic interactions between
the adions. The same is true for the KS studies on the coverage dependence of the adsorbate

P

charge.

(iii) In the KM formalism, the shift in adsorbate orbital energy due to a boson mode is
λ2/ωo < n > for all coverages. The coverage dependence of this shift comes only through

the coverage dependence of the average charge < n >. To take into account the progres-

sive desolvation of the adspecies with increasing coverage, the ensuing shift due to solvent
polarization modes is scaled by a factor (1 − θ2) in our formalism (cf. section 7).

6

(iv) The KM analysis employs “spin-less” approximation wherein the intraadsorbate

coulomb repulsion U is taken to be the largest energy parameter in the system. Thus, only

one electron is allowed in a valence orbital. In Hamiltonian (2.1), no such approximation

has been used.

(v) Both the KM and KS analysis are based on the wide-band approximation.

The above comparison shows that present formalism is qualitatively diﬀerent from the

KM and KS approach for the coverage-dependent properties of an adlayer. However, a

suitable extension of the wide-band limit based approach for random adlayer would enable

us to make a comparison between the present and the KM, KS formalism, at least when the

coverage is small. We refer to sections 6 and 8 for further details in this regard.

To summarize, the chemisorbed species are considered here to be distributed randomly

over various adsorption sites on the substrate lattice. These sites form a 2D lattice in a

medium of eﬀective dielectric constant 5.0. We take this 2D lattice to be commensurate

with the underlying substrate surface. This implies that the adspecies occupy “on-top”

positions. At coverages less than unity, the sites unoccupied by adsorbates constitute the

second component of the adlayer, the ﬁrst being the occupied sites. At complete coverage

(θ = 1) the adsorbates form (1 × 1) ordered structure. The various system components and

their interactions are described by the Hamiltonian (2.1).

2.1 An Eﬀective Hamiltonian.

The Hamiltonian (2.1) presents a complex problem, the reason being its many-body nature

and the inherent randomness in the system. The many-body aspect follows from the intraad-

sorbate coulomb repulsion and the fermion-boson interactions. We treat the former within

the Hartree-Fock approximation, which in eﬀect raises the Ea by U < na¯σ >. In an ear-

lier communication [16], we had analyzed the fermion-boson coupling in a detailed manner

through superoperator technique. Therein, it had been shown that for low frequency boson

modes, a mean ﬁeld decoupling

φnaσ ≈ < φ > naσ + φ < naσ >

(2.4)

suﬃces (φ = b + b†). Consequently, Ea gets further shifted by

ν=1,2 λiν < φν > where ν =
1, 2 respectively refers to orientational and vibrational polarization modes of the solvent. For

P

7

high frequency modes, it becomes necessary to go beyond the mean ﬁeld approximation. The

resulting shift in Ea is now

iν/ων], where indices 3 and 4 correspond to
electronic polarization branch in the solvent and surface plasmon oscillations in the substrate.

With these simpliﬁcations, and after substituting the value of < φν > [16], the Hamilto-

{i} implies a summation over occupied sites only. The second and third terms on the right

side of (2.6) describe the shifts in the adsorbate orbital energy due to slow and fast bosons

modes respectively. The fourth term takes into account the renormalization of U caused by

fermion-boson interactions. While evaluating the shift in ǫiσ due to bosonic coupling, the

boson-mediated interactions between diﬀerent sites are neglected. Next, since the adsorption

of a single species is considered, we replace λiν by λaν and λicν by λcν.

3 Green’s Function : A CPA approach

While constructing the eﬀective Hamiltonian (2.5) from (2.1), two important simpliﬁca-

tions are made. (i) A decoupling between the fermionic and bosonic components is achieved.

(ii) The system is now described by a one-body Hamiltonian. But the problem associated

with the random nature of {ǫiσ} still remains. We tackle it using the concept of coherent

potential approximation [20,22,23]. Herein, the random adsorbate layer is replaced by an

eﬀective, non-random, 2D medium. This is achieved by replacing the random variable ǫiσ

by a deterministic energy parameter kσ(ǫ) which is same for all the sites. kσ(ǫ) depends

on the energy variable ǫ. It has to be evaluated self-consistently using the condition that

the conﬁguration averaged t-matrix for an arbitrary site i, i.e. < ti >c is zero. < ... >c

denotes the conﬁguration average. The physical reasoning behind this step is linked to the

fact that random potentials at diﬀerent sites cause a scattering of incident particles. In an

eﬀective medium, potential is the same at all the sites and hence there is no scattering; thus

The fermion Green’s function (GF) matrix elements corresponding to sites on adsorbate

layer satisfy the relation [20,23]

< ti >c= 0.

4 Adsorbate density of states and occupation proba-

bility

To evaluate the adsorbate density of states at site i, we introduce a restricted conﬁguration

averaged GF < Gσ

ii >i=a. Here the restricted conﬁguration average means that we a priori

10

consider the site i to be occupied by an adsorbate. For the remaining sites, whose occupancy

status is left unspeciﬁed, conﬁguration average is performed. The adsorbate density of states

at the site i is given as:

ρσ

The imaginary part of the Green’s function is evaluated by taking ǫ ≡ ǫ − i0+ . A further

conﬁguration average at site i leads to

where ǫf is the Fermi energy. As ¯Gσ
determination of < niσ > is required. We determine

Z
ii implicitly depends on < niσ >, a self-consistent
it in the non-magnetic limit,

i.e., < niσ > = < ni¯σ > . Thus, in the present formalism, we need two self-consistency

calculations, one for the coherent potential kσ(ǫ), and the other for < niσ >.

5 Interaction Energy

The interaction energy for the chemisorbed system is deﬁned as

∆ ¯E = < H > − < H o >

where H is the Hamiltonian (2.5), with ǫiσ replaced by kσ(ǫ). H o is the Hamiltonian of the

far-separated substrate-adsorbate system.

6 Electrochemisorption : A simple model for numeri-

cal calculations

The results given in the last section require tedious summations over the momentum k

of the metal states and the momentum u of the Bloch states in the 2D adsorbate layer. But

we can achieve considerable simpliﬁcation under the following conditions [20].

1. It is mentioned in the section 2 that the adsorbate layer is commensurate with the

underlying substrate. As a result, the Brillouin zones of the adsorbate layer and the under-

lying parallel two-dimensional substrate lattice are the same. Assuming the separability of

the metal states energies {ǫk} in the directions parallel and perpendicular to the surface, one

can write

ǫk = ǫu,kz = ǫ||

u + ǫ⊥
kz

where the zero of the energy scale is taken at the substrate band center.

2. The density of states for the substrate in the direction perpendicular to surface is

taken to be Lorentzian, whereas the same is assumed to be rectangular along the surface :

the distance Rij and a universal constant speciﬁc to the system [24]. Since Rij is same for the

adsorbate and substrate layers, the hopping term vij for the adsorbate layer is proportional
to v′

ij, the hopping term in the substrate’s surface layer. Taking µ as the proportionality

constant, we have

and hence, using the Fourier transform (cf. eq 3.11)

Since the half-bandwidths of adsorbate layer, δ, and substrate surface, ∆||, are proportional
to vij and v′

ij respectively, we can write

The half-bandwidth δ in the above relation corresponds to the case of a complete mono-

layer. But, in fact, the bandwidth of adlayer depends on the coverage and tends to zero in

the low-coverage limit. Following the methodology described in ref 22, we can write δ(θ),

the coverage-dependent half-bandwidth of the adlayer, as θδ. Consequently, for a general

coverage, eq 6.8a gets modiﬁed as

It may be noted here that when the coverage tends to zero, the conﬁguration averaged

adsorbate Green’s function (cf. eq 3.10 equals θ times the adsorbate GF obtained for the

“lone-adsorbate” case. This remains valid for any strength of the vij [20,23].

For a given material, if the total bandwidth ∆t is known, the bandwidth 2∆|| for its

surface can be obtained using the relation [25]

Ns and Nb are the respective co-ordination numbers for the surface and bulk atoms. Using

eqs 3.12 and 6.1-6.7, the adsorbate GF and the self-consistency equation for the coherent

potential kσ(ǫ) can be rewritten as

The expression 6.10 for the adsorbate GF contains µ in the denominator. Though µ tends to
zero when the θ approaches zero, the ¯Gσ

ii(ǫ) remains ﬁnite in this limit. This can be veriﬁed
either by suitable expansion of adsorbate GF, or by a priori taking vij (and hence µ) to be

zero and reevaluating the adsorbate Green’s function [20,23].

In the above derivations for the adsorbate GF and the binding energy, W ′(ǫ, u), the

Fourier coeﬃcient of W ′

ij (cf. eqs 3.4 and 3.11), has been explicitly evaluated using the
ii and ∆ ¯E
can be evaluated using the wide-band approximation. As noted in the Introduction, this

approximation has been extensively used in the chemisorption problems at electrochemical

interface, as well as in the Kravstov and Mal’shukov work on adlayer [21]. Accordingly, we

now have

W ′

il(ǫ) ≈ i∆

(6.15)

where ∆ is an energy-independent quantity and is a measure of adsorbate’s energy width

[17,21]. Within the above approximation, expression 6.10 for the adsorbate GF now becomes

The superscript (w) here speciﬁes the wide-band limit. While calculating the average

adsorbate charge and the binding energy, the θ appearing in numerator of the right-hand

side of the above expression gets canceled with a θ in the denominator (cf. eqs 4.3 and 5.15)

and we recover the lone-adsorbate result of Kornyshev and Schmickler.

When the interaction energy is evaluated within the wide-band approximation, the ξσ

appearing on the right-hand side of eq 6.13 is identically zero. Also the integral in this

expression can be rewritten as (cf. eqs 4.3 and 4.4):

In the following sections, the details of the electronic structure of an copper layer ad-

sorbed on gold electrode are considered. We give the results both for the general analysis

and the wide-band approximation. A comparative study of these two approaches for the

chemisorption problem is also provided.

7 Electrochemisorption of copper on gold electrode

The relevance of substrate d band in the chemisorption phenomenon is well recognized.

The importance of d band arises from its high density of states. Besides, the substrate d-

orbitals provide strong, directed bonding with the adsorbate electronic states. Consequently,

we model the gold substrate through its d band in the present calculations. But it may be

17

mentioned here that the gold d band lies deeply under the Fermi level. In fact the gold Fermi

level lies inside the sp-band. Therefore, one needs to include both d and sp bands of gold

in the chemisorption calculations. In this regard, the Lorentzian density of states in eq 6.2

can be considered as the eﬀective density of states which includes both d and sp bands of

gold. It may be noted that the density of states for d band alone is semielliptical, and not

Lorentzian.

In an earlier calculation for the electrosorption, the participation of only the s orbital of

copper in the bonding was assumed [26]. But a proper analysis requires the inclusion of both s

and d orbitals of copper in the model. There are three main reasons why a d-orbital of copper

is also relevant to electrosorption process: (i) energetically it lies near the substrate d band

when the intraadsorbate Coulomb repulsion Ud is taken into account, (ii) it has a large matrix
element with the substrate states, and (iii) during the chemisorption of Cu2+, a substantial

amount of charge transfer occurs from the substrate to an unoccupied copper d-orbital.

Therefore, both s and d orbitals of copper are included in the calculations. Subsequent

analysis then requires a simultaneous self-consistent determination of the adsorbate charges

< nsσ >, < ndσ >, and the coherent potentials ksσ(ǫ) and kdσ(ǫ). In order to simplify this

diﬃcult task, we neglect the indirect interactions between s and d orbitals. Thus we treat the

electrosorption of s and d orbitals separately. The self-consistency criterion is now applicable

to individual pairs (< nsσ >, ksσ(ǫ)) and (< ndσ >, kdσ(ǫ)) only.

7.1 System Parameters

The energies of copper s and d orbitals lie at 7.72 eV and 20.14 eV below the vacuum

level [24]. In the present calculations, energy zero is taken at the center of the substrate d

band. Hence

Es = φ + ǫf − 7.72

;

Ed = φ + ǫf − 20.14

(7.1)

φ is the substrate work function and ǫf is its Fermi level measured from the band center.

The intraadsorbate repulsion energy for s and d orbitals, namely Us and Ud, are 5.92 eV and

5.45 eV, respectively [24,27].

We employ the Dogonadze, Kornyshev, and Schmickler scheme [26,28] to evaluate the

contributions of various solvent polarization modes toward the total solvation energy. Ac-

cordingly, the contributions from the orientational, vibrational, and electronic polarization

18

and the correlation lengths λ1, λ2, and λ3 for the three polarization branches are 0.68, 0.12,
and 0.10 nm respectively. The ionic radius is ri (0.127, 0.096, and 0.072 nm for Cu0 , Cu1+
and Cu2+, respectively) and ǫir (= 4.9), ǫopt (1.15), and ǫs (78.5) are the infrared, optical,

and static dielectric constants for water. The radius of a fractionally charged adsorbate is

obtained through the interpolation formula provided in ref 26. α is the degree of solvation of
the adsorbate at the interface. The parameter X is so chosen that z2(E1 + E2 + E3)/α equals

the solvation energy ∆GS of an ion having charge z. X in fact accounts for any discrepancy

in the calculated and experimental solvation energies. At a metal-vacuum interface, the
image energy of a unit charge is taken as −e2/4(x + κ−1) [29], where κ−1 is the Thomas-
Fermi screening length. For gold, κ−1 = 0.06 nm. x is the distance of the charge from the

electrode surface. We take the distance between the copper adsorbate and the underlying

gold atom to be the same as the distance between two nearest adsorbed copper atoms in the

monolayer conﬁguration, i.e., 0.288 nm [4]. The electrode plane is considered to be located

at the midpoint between the copper and gold atoms. Therefore, the distance x between the

adsorbate and substrate surface is 0.144 nm. Substituting these values, we get the image

energy ǫim = −1.76 eV . Thus, we now have

As noted earlier, (E1 + E2 + E3)/α = ∆Gs = 5.92 eV is the solvation energy of a singly

charged copper ion [26]. When the adsorbate is in the bulk solution region, λo2

aν/ων = Eν/α.
The solvation energy of the interfacial adsorbate, as considered above, is appropriate

for low-coverage regime. At the higher coverages, adsorbates progressively get desolvated.

This is caused by (i) steric eﬀects and (ii) delocalization of adsorbate electron over a large

spatial region for metallic adsorbates. The delocalization of electrons causes a weakening of

the adsorbate-solvent interaction and it also leads to an eﬀective screening of the adsorbate

core charge. In fact when θ = 1, the electrons are delocalized over the entire 2D copper

layer. This layer can be now considered to form the outermost surface of the electrode.

Consequently, its interaction with the solvent polarization, as a ﬁrst approximation, can be

neglected. Since no theoretical study of the dependence of the adsorbate solvation energy
∆Ga
Eν, and hence for ∆Ga

s on coverage seems to be available, we propose the following interpolative scheme for

s(θ), as a function of coverage

Eν(θ) = (1 − θ2)Eν

(7.5)

The presence of θ2 in a sense takes into account the correlation in a primitive way. The

decrease in adsorbate solvation energy Eν(θ) depends on the probability of ﬁnding another

adsorbate in its vicinity. The relation 7.5 satisﬁes the limiting cases corresponding to θ → 0

and θ = 1. We now have

In the calculation, we take λaνs = λaνd = λaν. The suﬃxes s and d denote s and d orbitals.

We take the coupling strengths of a unit positive core charge and the orbital electron with

solvent modes to be of the equal magnitude. In the neutral state, the copper s orbital is

singly occupied, hence for the underlying core charge, |λcνs| is equal to |λaν|., On the other

hand, a d orbital is doubly occupied in the neutral state and so |λcνd| = 2|λaν|.

The ab initio calculation of the matrix elements {v} (cf. eqs 6.5 and 6.11) between the

orbitals of copper adsorbate and gold electrode is a diﬃcult task. We treat them as adjustable

parameters in our calculations. Reasonable estimates for these parameters can be obtained

through the existing data . The vs for the hydrogen adsorption on transition metals is ≈ 4.00

20

eV [13,23]. Now vs varies as R−3, where R is the inter-atomic spacing [24]. The equilibrium

distance Re for an hydrogen atom chemisorbed on copper, or other transition metals is

∼ 0.20nm [25]. This is less than 0.288 nm , the separation between copper and the gold
substrate. The R−3 dependence of vs implies that for the present system, vs is smaller than

4.0 eV. In our calculations, we have taken vs as 2.70 eV at the M-V interface and allowed for

its variation at electrochemical interface. Schrieﬀer et al. have speciﬁed that for transition

metals, vd lies in the range 4 ∼ 6 eV [29]. We take vd = 4.85 eV. As subsequent calculations

will demonstrate, these speciﬁc values of vs and vd enable us to recover the observed trends

in the average adsorbate charge and give reasonable estimates of the binding energy both

for the metal-vacuum and electrode-electrolyte interface.

Gold forms a fcc lattice. The coordination number Nb of a gold atom in the bulk is

12. The coordination number Ns of an atom at the Au(111) surface is 6. ∆t, the total d

bandwidth of gold, is 5.6 eV [24]. Using eq 6.9, we get ∆|| = 1.40 eV. From (6.4) ∆⊥ = 1.40

eV. The d bandwidth of copper is 3.47 eV [24]. Through similar argument, we get δ, the half

d bandwidth of 2D adsorbed copper layer as 0.87 eV. Hence from eq 6.8, µd = 0.6 for the

copper monolayer. The bandwidth of unhybridized copper s band is taken as E(Γ) − E(X)

which equals 4.21 eV [30]. Consequently µs = 0.75. The work function of gold electrode is

4.8 eV, and its Fermi level, measured from the d band center, is 5.20 eV [24]. We have taken

α, the degree of solvation of the adsorbate, as 0.50. This value lies exactly at the midpoint

of the prescribed range 0.33-0.66 [26]. Finally, the energy ǫΓ of the conduction band bottom

for the gold is taken at 8.10 eV below the Fermi energy [22]. We recall that this quantity is

needed to calculate of binding energy in the wide-band approximation.

Unless stated otherwise, the various parameters employed in the calculations are sum-

marized in Table 1.

8 Numerical Results and Discussions

8.1 Average occupation probability and energetics

With a view to have a comparative study of chemisorption at the metal-vacuum and

electrochemical interface, we begin our calculations with the same values of the matrix

elements vs(2.70eV ) and vd(4.85eV ) for both the interfaces.

Two speciﬁc features concerning the copper d orbital occupancy < ndσ > emerges through

21

the calculations: (i) this orbital is almost completely ﬁlled upon chemisorption and, (ii) the

variations in the coverage have little eﬀect on < ndσ >. This is true both for the metal-

vacuum (< ndσ > ≈ 0.97) and electrochemical (< ndσ > ≈ 0.965) interfaces. Since

the level shift caused by external applied potential is not considered in the calculations,

the results reported in this section pertain to the potential of zero charge. The plot for

self-consistent evaluation of < ndσ > at electrochemical interface is given in Figure 1. The

point of interaction between the straight line and the curve describing the calculated values

of charge on copper d orbital Ndσ, corresponding to various input of < ¯ndσ > (cf. eq 4.4),

gives the required self-consistent value.

In contrast to < ndσ >, the average occupancy < nsσ > for copper s orbital is more

sensitive to the coverage variation. As the Cu d orbital is almost completely ﬁlled, any

variation in the adsorbate net charge arises through the changes in the < nsσ >. We ﬁrst

consider the case of metal-vacuum interface, wherein < nsσ > is around 0.3. The increase

in coverage results in a slight increase in < nsσ > (cf. Figure 2). The change is minimal

in the low-coverage regime. The curve a in Figure 3 leads to the self-consistent evaluation

of < nsσ > when θ = 0.1. The U term in the adsorbate’s s orbital energy expression leads

to an upward level shift with the increasing value of input < ¯nsσ >, which in turn reduces

the calculated value of adsorbate charge Nsσ. We get a single self-consistent solution for

< nsσ > in the entire coverage range. The variation in the copper s orbital binding energy

∆Es with respect to < ¯nsσ > gives rise to an energy extremum at the self-consistent value of

the orbital charge. For θ = 0.9, and the corresponding self-consistent < nsσ > at 0.327, the

occurrence of the extremum in |∆Es| is shown in Figure 4. Note that in the present case,

∆Es equals -|∆Es|.

For the chemisorption at the metal-vacuum interface, the θ variation has a minimal eﬀect

on d orbital binding energy ∆Ed. The major contribution to the total binding energy ∆E

(= ∆Es + ∆Ed) comes through ∆Es (≈ -1.6 eV). The ∆Ed is ≈ -0.42 eV and the total

binding energy is ≈ -2.00 eV.

Before taking up the evaluation of Cu s orbital occupancy at the gold electrode in the

electrochemical environment, let us restate some relevant experimental facts. The partial

charge transfer coeﬃcient λ is one of the important parameters in the electrosorption studies.

It equals to the diﬀerence of charges on the adsorbate when it is in the bulk, and when it

22

lies at the interface. For the chemisorption of ionic Cu2+,

λ = 2(< nsσ > + < ndσ >) − 1

8.1

Though λ itself is not a measurable quantity, its numerical value lies close to the experimen-

tally determined electrosorption valency γn [11,12]. In the θ → 0 limit, γn for Cu/Au system

is 2.0 [12]. Thus the double layer studies coupled with the thermodynamic analysis indicate

that the copper adsorbed at a gold electrode is neutral when the coverage is small.

On the other hand, Tadjeddine et al. have shown using the in situ X-ray absorption

spectroscopy that in the higher coverage domain, charge on the copper adatom on a gold

electrode is close to +1.0 [6].

make a simple calculation for ∆E′

This substantial reported variation in < nsσ > with changing coverage prompts us to
s, the energy required to bring a single Cu+ ion from
the bulk electrolyte to the interface when the bonding is very weak (vs → 0), but the

occupancy of the copper’s s spin-orbital in the interfacial region is < nsσ >. In this case

of negligible bonding, the main contribution to the energetics would come from (i) partial

desolvation of the ion at the electrode, (ii) image energy contribution, (iii) change in energy

while transferring charge 2< nsσ > from the Fermi level of the electrode to the unbroadened

orbital of the adsorbate at the interface, and (iv) intraadsorbate coulomb repulsion Us. In

been neglected. We have taken the degree of solvation α of the copper ion at the interface
as 0.5. The expressions given here for ∆E′

s for various cases can be obtained either directly,
or taking vs = 0 appropriately in eqs 5.3-5.7 and 5.15. These elementary calculations
show that in the absence of bonding ( vs = 0), bringing a Cu+ ion from the bulk phase to

the interface is energetically unfavorable, irrespective of the charge state of copper at the

23

interface. This remains true for entire plausible range of α between 0.33 and 0.66. Next the

ionic conﬁgurations of copper at the interface have relatively lower energy than the neutral
copper atom, with Cu+ being the least energy conﬁguration.

In the above calculations, we have taken vs to be zero. But in order to have diﬀerent

charge states of copper at the interface, we need a ﬁnite vs, howsoever inﬁnitesimal its

magnitude may be. In addition, it has to be veriﬁed that we indeed get more than one self-

consistent solutions for < nsσ >, so that all the charge states of copper considered above are

realized at the interface. Taking vs = 0.02 eV (which is 2 orders of magnitude lower than its

earlier value of 2.70 eV), and θ = 0.1 (leading to very low concentration of the adsorbates),

we get all the three charge states of copper adsorbate. The self consistent values of < nsσ >

are 0.0, 0.504, and 1.0. Their respective binding energies (cf. eqs 5.15 and 6.13) are 1.32,
3.51, and 1.50 eV, which compare well with the ∆E′

s values obtained earlier.

Next when we allow vs to take the value 2.70 eV, it is pertinent to examine whether (i)

one still gets three diﬀerent charge states of copper, (ii) the binding energy becomes negative,

and (iii) a less ionic state of copper adsorbate is more stable? The calculations corresponding

to θ = 0.1 conﬁrm the ﬁrst point but the answers to the next two queries are in the negative.

The self-consistent values of < nsσ > are now 0.074, 0.665, and 0.98. The associated s orbital
binding energies ∆Es are -2.32x10−2, 1.85, and 1.34 eV respectively. This shows that even

a strong coupling between the copper s orbital and the metal states does not make neutral

copper atom relatively more stable than the positively charged copper adsorbate in the low-

coverage regime, nor does it lower the energy suﬃciently so as to make the chemisorption

of copper at gold electrode feasible. As we shall shortly show, the adsorption is possible

due to the bonding of copper d orbital. Subsequent calculations with progressive increasing

coverage show that the roots of < nsσ > lying at 0.074 and 0.665 shift toward higher values,

whereas the one at 0.98 moves downward. At θ = 0.52 the lowest root shifts to 0.09 (∆Es

= 0.52 eV) and the remaining two roots merge and take a common value 0.89 (∆Es = 2.01

eV). Beyond this coverage, we get only one self-consistent solution for < nsσ > giving rise to

a positively charged copper adsorbate. Thus when θ = 0.75, < nsσ > = 0.14 ( ∆Es= 1.02

eV) and the same for θ = 1.0 is 0.33 (∆Es = 1.23 eV).

When θ = 0.1 and vs = 2.70 eV, the net charge Q on copper corresponding to various

self-consistent values of < nsσ > is +0.92, -0.26, and -0.89. These values are obtained by

adding the d orbital and core charges to 2< nsσ >.

24

Q = −2(< nsσ > + < ndσ >) + 3

8.2

The least charge on copper is -0.26, which does not make the Cu adatom exactly neutral.

In fact it has been shown earlier that the neutral state of copper is obtained when vs =0.02

eV. Thus, in order to lower the relative large negative charge -0.26, we now take vs = 2.0

eV. The charge -0.26 now gets reduced to -0.11. The other motivation for taking vs as 2.0

eV, apart from its earlier considered value of 2.70 eV, is that it allows us to understand the

eﬀect of vs variation on chemisorption characteristics. We also note that the variation of vd

has least eﬀect on the d orbital occupancy.

The self-consistent plot for < nsσ > when vs = 2.0 eV is given in Figure 3. For θ = 0.10,

we get three self-consistent values at 0.04, 0.59, and 0.99. The change in the locations of

various roots with increasing coverage follows a trend identical to the vs = 2.70 eV case. But

instead of at θ = 0.52, the merger of the two higher roots takes place at θ = 0.65. At this

point, the common value of these roots are 0.88. The remaining root lies at 0.079. Beyond

θ = 0.65, only the smallest root survives, whose magnitude keeps on increasing with further

increase in coverage. Finally, at θ = 1.00, the < nsσ > is 0.39 which is 0.06 more than the

corresponding value when vs = 2.70 eV.

It may be noted that the slow boson terms, weighted by < nsσ >, now lower the adsorbate

orbital energy with increasing < nsσ > (cf. eq 2.6). As the magnitude of these quantities

are greater than the U term (unless θ is quite large (cf. eq 7.7)), calculated Nsσ increases

with increasing value of input < ¯nsσ >.

The occurrence of extremum in |∆Es| for θ = 0.1 (< nsσ > = 0.04, 0.59 , 0.99) and θ =

0.67 (< nsσ > = 0.082) at electrochemical interface is shown in Figure 4. Note that presently

∆Es = |∆Es|.

The net charge on copper with varying coverage at the electrochemical interface is shown

in Figure 5. Since the d orbital occupancy is virtually constant, the structure in charge

variations solely arise due to < nsσ >. At the gold electrode, we get three diﬀerent charged

states of Cu up to θ = 0.65. The states which are almost completely ionic when θ is small,

tend to lower their net charge when coverage increases. This variation is relatively faster
for the positive charge state. On the other hand, the Cu−0.11 conﬁguration in the low-

coverage region progressively acquires more electronic charge with increase in θ. But beyond

a critical coverage (θ = 0.65), both the negatively charged conﬁgurations of copper cease to

25

exist. Only the state having positive charge, which is also the least energy conﬁguration for

all θ values, survives. Given the net charge Q on the copper adsorbate, the partial charge

transfer coeﬃcient can also be obtained using the relation λ = 2 − Q (cf. eqs 8.1 and 8.2).

It is pertinent to analyze the reason behind the transition from multiple solutions to a

single root for < nsσ > with increasing coverage at electrochemical interface. We obtain

only a single self-consistent solution for the adsorbate charge at metal-vacuum interface in

the entire coverage ( 0 < θ ≤ 1) range. The multiple roots occur only at electrochemical

interface, where the solvation of adspecies and its progressive desolvation with increasing

coverage are the additional features. We note that presently the eﬀect of external applied

potential has not been considered. It is the presence of additional boson modes corresponding

to the solvent polarization which are responsible for more than one self-consistent value for

adsorbate charge.[21,31,32]. The calculations show that all the three roots of < nsσ > survive

for all coverages if the desolvation of the adsorbate with the increasing coverage is disallowed.

In fact it is this progressive desolvation which leads to the transition from multiple to a single

charge state of copper. In the present formalism the desolvation eﬀect has been modeled
through the scaling factor (1 − θ2). But the occurrence of this transition does not depend

on this speciﬁc form of the scaling factor. Any factor f (θ) will do , provided f (θ) → 0 when

θ → 1, and f (θ) → 1 when θ → 0. These limits imply that in the former case, the solvation

energy of the adsorbate is α∆Gs and the same is zero when a metallic adsorbate forms a
monolayer. We have, however, taken f (θ) as (1 − θ2) since this implies that the decrease in

the solvation energy of the adsorbate depends on the probability of ﬁnding another adsorbate

in its vicinity.

The presence of multiple charge state for the copper s orbital, and the subsequent tran-

sition to a single charge state beyond a critical coverage, also get reﬂected in the binding

energy ∆Es of the copper s orbital in the electrochemical environment. The change in

∆Es with respect to coverage is substantial. But more importantly, ∆Es is positive for all

coverage regime. Therefore, the consideration of s orbital alone would not lead to the electro-

chemisorption of copper. This contrasts with the adsorption at the metal-vacuum interface

wherein the s orbital bonding provides the major contribution to the chemisorption energy.

The diﬀerence in the s orbital bonding nature at the metal-vacuum and electrode-electrolyte

interface is a consequence of the fact that in the former case, a far separated copper adsorbate

is in a neutral state, whereas in the latter case, s orbital is unoccupied in a solvated copper

26

ion residing deep inside the bulk electrolyte. The desolvation of adsorbate upon chemisorp-
tion and energy diﬀerence between a neutral copper atom and a solvated Cu+ ion leads to

positive energy value for s orbital bonding. The binding energy contribution ∆Ed for copper

d orbital does not vary much with coverage and it is suﬃciently negative (≈ −4.4 eV ). The

negative chemisorption energy for the d orbital results from the large diﬀerence between the

energies of the copper d orbital and gold Fermi level. Upon electrochemisorption, an unoc-

cupied copper d orbital gets almost completely ﬁlled and this leads to substantial decrease

in the energy.

The total binding energy ∆E is a negative quantity, thus making electrosorption of copper

on gold electrode feasible (cf. Figure 6), whatever may be the charge state of the copper

adsorbate. But as we have noted earlier, conﬁgurations having more ionic character are

more stable, with the positive charge state being most stable. The calculations have also

shown that ∆E at the electrode-electrolyte interface is more negative than the ∆E at the

metal-vacuum interface. Finally, we have also veriﬁed that a decrease in α, the degree of

solvation for an interfacial adsorbate, reduces the binding energy.

The analysis presented here unambiguously supports the Tadjeddine et al.

in situ ex-

perimental results showing a positive charge copper adatom when the coverage is large [6].

In this domain, only one self-consistent value of < nsσ > exists. For the low coverages, the

theory predicts that apart from ionic conﬁgurations, copper adsorbate can also exist in a

relatively neutral state. But the energetic considerations make this state to be unstable. In

fact when vs → 0, the stability of the various possible charge states of copper decreases in
the order Cu+ > Cu− > Cuo. The subsequent increase in vs does not alter this trend; it

only lowers the respective energy values. So it seems that Tadjeddine et al., experimental

observation of a positive charge copper adsorbate at higher coverage should be valid even for

small θ (including the case of a single adsorbate). In such a case, the net charge on copper

would decrease in a smooth way with the increasing coverage (curve a, Figure 5).

On the other hand, electrosorption valence data suggest that copper is neutral when

the coverage is low. But this still requires a justiﬁcation why the copper adsorbate on

gold electrode should exist in a metastable conﬁguration at low coverage. Notwithstanding

the above energetic considerations, if the copper adsorbate is indeed neutral for small θ,

the present formalism provides a method to verify this situation. The analysis carried out

so far regarding the charge variation with coverage shows that the relatively neutral copper

27

adatom ﬁrst becomes more negative with increasing coverage. But beyond a critical coverage,

it acquires a positive charge in a discontinuous fashion (cf. Figure 5). So in case copper

adsorbate exists in two diﬀerent charge conﬁgurations in the low and higher coverage regime,

the switch over between them is not smooth. A sharp valence transition for the copper

adatom in the intermediate coverage region thus signiﬁes the presence of a neutral copper

when coverage is low. We also note that decrease in vs shifts this critical coverage to higher

values.

8.2 Wide band limit

We now provide a brief discussion on the applicability of the wide-band limit to copper

adsorption on gold. We start with the lone adsorbate case (cf. eq 6.16a) Following refs 17

and 18, we take ∆s as 1.0 eV. For the chemisorption at the M-V interface, only one self-

consistent value of < nsσ > equal to 0.49 is obtained. That the < nsσ > lies near to 0.5 can

be ascertained by comparing the copper s orbital energy with ∆s. Taking the energy zero

at the Fermi level, the ǫsσ is 0.04 eV when < nsσ > is 0.5. As this value is much lower than

∆s, the self-consistent expression

< niσ >= (1/π)cot−1(ǫiσ/∆i) ;

{i = s, d}

ǫiσ = ǫo

a − ziǫim + (Ui + 2ǫim) < ni¯σ > ;

{zi = 1(3) f or s(d) − orbital}

8.3

leads to < nsσ > ≈ 0.5 in the non-magnetic limit.

The lower edge of conduction band ǫΓ for gold lies at 8.10 eV below the Fermi level [22].

With this cutoﬀ, the s orbital binding energy ∆Es when the charge is 0.49 is - 0.74 eV only.

This binding energy at M-V interface is obtained by using the relation

∆Ei =

σ ǫiσ < niσ > −(Ui + 2ǫim) < niσ >< ni¯σ > +

σ(∆i/2π) ln

{xi = 1(2) f or s(d) − orbital}
8.4

The above expressions for the average charge and binding energy for a single adsorbate

at M-V interface follows from eqs 6.16a, 6.18, 5.15, and 7.4.

For the copper d orbital, the self-consistent < ndσ > at the M-V interface is 0.96 when

∆d = 1.0 eV. The corresponding binding energy ∆Ed is +1.98 eV. If ∆d is taken as 2.0 eV,

28

the above two quantities are 0.925 and +3.07 eV respectively. The reason behind getting

such positive values for ∆Ed is that the argument of the ln function in eq 8.4 is greater than

unity when the cutoﬀ is taken at the bottom of conduction band. The binding energy value

is also sensitive to the lower cutoﬀ limit. For example, if the cutoﬀ is taken arbitrarily at

-15.0 eV, the ∆Ed gets reduced from +3.07 to +1.48 eV. This strong dependence of binding

energy on cutoﬀ parameter is also true for the copper s orbital. With lower cutoﬀ at -15.0

eV, ∆Es corresponding to ∆s = 1.0 eV is -1.13 eV. Finally in all the cases, the total binding

energy remains positive.

Thus we ﬁnd that the wide-band approximation predicts no binding even for the single

adsorbate case at the M-V interface, and the copper adsorbate exists in almost neutral state.

Application of this formalism to a lone copper adsorbate at gold electrode again gives

rise to three self-consistent solutions for < nsσ > at 0.085 (∆Es = 1.25 eV), 0.51 (∆Es =

2.21 eV), and 0.91 (∆Es = 2.00 eV) when ∆s = 1.0 eV and the lower cutoﬀ is placed at the

ǫΓ in the energy calculations. The corresponding < ndσ > is 0.96 (∆Ed = -2.14 eV) for ∆d

= 1.0 eV.

The above calculation again shows that as θ → 0 , the Cu+0.91 is the most stable con-
ﬁguration, followed by Cu−0.74. The nearly neutral charge state of copper (Cu+0.06) is the

least stable one. The respective total binding energies corresponding to these three charge

conﬁgurations are -0.89, -0.14, and 0.07 eV.

Calculations based on eqs 4.3-4.4, and 6.16 show that the two roots of < nsσ > again

merge at θ = 0.63. Beyond this coverage, the < nsσ > is single valued, and it equals 0.23,

0.39, 0.474, 0.486, and 0.49 when θ is 0.64, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, and 1.0 respectively. Thus wide-

band approximation leads to a relatively neutral conﬁguration of copper in the high-coverage

regime.

The above analysis shows that the gross features like multiple roots for < nsσ > at the

E-E interface, relative stability of these solutions, and existence of a single solution beyond a

critical coverage can be obtained through the wide-band limit based approach. But it gives

poor result for binding energy. Besides, it predicts the existence of almost neutral copper

adsorbate for large coverages which is contrary to the observations of Tadjeddine et al. [6].

29

8.3 Adsorbate’s Density of States

The present calculations have shown that the average occupancy of copper d orbital

remains constant with respect to change in the coverage, whereas < nsσ > exhibits steep

variation. The underlying reason for this feature can be understood through the respective

density of states. The copper d orbital density of states for θ = 0.1 in the electrochemical

environment is plotted in Figure 7. The two peaks in the density of states, lying below the

Fermi level (at 5.20 eV above the energy zero which is taken at the gold d band center) are

to be ascribed to the bonding and antibonding states, broadened due to their interactions

with the substrate band. Only the tail portion of the density of states lies near the Fermi

level. A change in the coverage, though inducing a slight shift in the peaks positions and

reducing their heights, does not alter the density of states near the Fermi level. Thus the

d orbital average occupancy, which is the integrated density of states up to Fermi level,

remains constant with the varying coverage. When θ = 0.10, we get three density of states

for the copper s orbital corresponding to the three self-consistent values of < nsσ > at E-E

interface . The density of states (dos) for < nsσ > = 0.04 and 0.99 lie much above and below

the Fermi level, respectively (Figure 8). The former has a single narrow peak and the latter

is broad and exhibits a diﬀuse satellite peak. The dos ρa corresponding to < nsσ > = 0.59 is

peaked around the Fermi level and has a small satellite peak. As the coverage is increased,

peaks in the dos for the least and largest < nsσ > move toward the Fermi level whereas

the dos peak corresponding to middle root shifts below the ǫf (Figure 9). This explains the

ensuing variation in the adsorbate charge with coverage. The ionic conﬁgurations tend to

reduce their net charge, whereas the neutral state becomes more negative with increasing

θ (cf. Figure 5). Note that the increase in θ leads to a broader density of states along

with reduced peak height. Whenever a dos peak lies in the vicinity of ǫf , any change in its

position or shape, resulting either from the increase in coverage, or through variations in the

other system parameters, has a pronounced eﬀect on the magnitude of the corresponding

charge. This explains the large variation in the net charge Q in diﬀerent coverage domains

(branches a, b in Figure 5).

The adsorbate density of states are primarily considered here to explain the trends in

the adsorbate average occupation probability, and it is also needed for the binding energy

calculation. But ρa also plays a central role in the charge transfer processes involving metal-

adsorbate complex, be it radiative, nonradiative, or related to STM studies. In this context,

30

earlier results for the adsorbate dos by Schmickler, Kuznetsov, and Ulstrup for electron

transfer via adspecies [31,33-35] and the more recent work by Schmickler for STM studies

[36,37] of redox couple and in situ electron tunneling through thin water layer at electrode are

notable. Recently we have obtained a closed form expression for ρa within the semiclassical

approach for solvent and wide-band approximation. The density of states thus derived

admits Lorentzian, Gaussian, and delta function structure in appropriate limits [38]. The

voltage spectroscopy of adsorbate ions, preferably through STM measurements, can give

information about the in situ adsorbate density of states [39]. Though this approach has

been used extensively to obtain ρa at the M-V interface [40], to our knowledge no such

experimental result in the context of E-E interface is available. We shall report in future

papers how the various electron transfer processes noted above are aﬀected by the coverage

dependence of the adsorbate density of states.

9 Summary and Conclusions

In order to understand the electronic structure of a chemisorbed layer in an electrochemical

environment, an appropriate model Hamiltonian based formalism is constructed. Starting

with the lone adsorbate case (θ → 0), the formalism is valid up to monolayer regime (θ = 1).

The adsorbates are assumed to occupy the on-top positions over the substrate atoms and the

adsorbate layer is commensurate with the underlying electrode surface lattice. At coverages

less than unity, the adsorbates are distributed randomly over various adsorption sites, and

give rise to a 2D electron band in the monolayer regime. The randomness in the system is

treated self-consistently through the CPA approach. The adsorbate self-energies arising due

to its hybridization with the substrate states are evaluated using appropriate density of states

for the substrate band. This allows us to go beyond the wide-band approximation, removes

the divergence associated with the binding energy calculation in the wide-band limit, and

leads to non-Lorentzian adsorbate density of states.

The formalism is applied to a chemisorbed layer of copper on gold electrode. The following

are our main results:

1. Double layer studies have suggested that at low coverages, copper electrochemisorbed on

gold electrode exists in a neutral state. The in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy indicates

that in the monolayer regime, copper adion is positively charged. Present theoretical analysis

supports the latter. When the coverage is low, three self-consistent charge states for copper

31

are possible. Though one of them is relatively neutral, binding energy calculations make

it to be the least stable. The positive charge conﬁguration of copper is most stable at all

coverages.

2. The transition from multiple to unique charge conﬁguration for copper is caused due

to the progressive desolvation of copper adion with the increasing coverage. In spite of the

energetic considerations, if the copper adsorbate is indeed neutral in the low and positively

charged in the higher coverage domains, the switchover between these two conﬁgurations

is not smooth. It occurs through a sharp valence transition in the copper adatom in the

intermediate-coverage region.

3. The coverage variation has a little eﬀect on copper d-orbital occupancy. All the diﬀerent

charge conﬁgurations of the copper adsorbate result due to changes in its s orbital occupancy

with varying coverage.

4. Density of states for the d orbital of the chemisorbed copper exhibits a two-peak structure.

Both the peaks lie well below the Fermi level of gold. Thus, a shift in the peak positions,

either because of the coverage variation or due to change in other parameters, would have

minimal eﬀect on the observables pertaining to the copper d orbital. On the other hand, the

major peak corresponding to at least one of the density of states for s orbital always lies near

the Fermi level. Consequently, the s orbital properties are more sensitive to the coverage

and other parametric variations.

5. Calculations have shown that for the copper chemisorption on gold at the metal-vacuum

interface, it is the s orbital bonding which contributes maximally towards the binding energy.

But in the electrochemical environment, the binding energy for the s orbital is positive. The

binding is possible only when the d orbital energy contributions are also taken into account

in the energy calculations.

6. The wide-band limit based approach has been generalized to study the electronic proper-

ties of a random chemisorbed layer. The subsequent analysis shows that it gives poor results

for binding energy. Besides, it predicts the existence of almost neutral copper adsorbate for

large coverages which is contrary to the experimental observations of Tadjeddine et al. [6].

We have presently treated the randomness in the system through coherent potential

approximation, which is an eﬀective mean-ﬁeld theory. To take into account the possible

short-range order in the system, one needs to go beyond the CPA approach.

The copper adsorption in the presence of anions and the electron transfer through ad-

32

sorbed layer represent possible extensions of the present work. Our results on these important

problems will be reported in future communications.

FIG.1 Self-consistent solution to d orbital occupancy of Cu chemisorbed on Au(111) elec-
trode surface at electrochemical interface: (a) θ = 0.10, < ndσ > = 0.965; (b) θ = 0.90,
< ndσ > = 0.967. Refer to TABLE 1 for parameters.

FIG.2 Coverage dependence of average s orbital occupancy < nsσ > for Cu chemisorbed on

Au(111) surface at the metal-vacuum interface.

FIG.3 Self-consistent solutions to s orbital occupancy of Cu chemisorbed on Au(111): (a)
θ = 0.10, < nsσ > = 0.285 (M-V interface, vs = 2.70 eV ); (b) θ = 0.10, < nsσ > =
0.04, 0.59 and 0.99 (E-E interface, vs = 2.0 eV); (c) θ = 0.67, < nsσ > = 0.082 (E-E
interface, vs = 2.0 eV).

FIG.4 Extremum in the binding energy ∆Es at the self-consistent values of average elec-
tronic charge on copper s orbital. (a) θ = 0.90, < nsσ > = 0.327 (M-V interface, vs =
2.70 eV); the parameters for (b) and (c) are same as for curves b and c in the Figure
3 .

FIG.5 Total charge Q on Cu electrochemisorbed on Au(111) electrode: coverage depen-
dence. The branches (a), (b), and (c) correspond to multiple self-consistent values of
< nsσ > (vs = 2.0 eV). (a) and (b) merge together at θ = 0.65 where the common
value of Q is -0.69.

FIG.6 Coverage dependence of the total binding energy ∆E for Cu on Au(111) at elec-
trochemical interface. The curves a′, b′, and (c′) here depict the respective binding
energies corresponding to the branches a, b, and c in Figure 5 for the total charge on
copper.

FIG.7 d orbital density of states for Cu electrochemisorbed on Au(111) electrode: (a) θ =
0.10, < ndσ > = 0.965; (b) θ = 0.90, < ndσ > = 0.967. Au d band centre is at 0.0 eV.
ǫf = 5.20 eV, vacuum level at 10.00 eV.

FIG.8 s orbital density of states for Cu electrochemisorbed on Au(111) electrode. θ = 0.10,
vs = 2.0 eV. (a) < nsσ > = 0.04, the height of dos peak is 4.01; (b) < nsσ > = 0.59;
(c) < nsσ > = 0.99.

FIG.9 s orbital density of states for Cu electrochemisorbed on Au(111) electrode. θ = 0.50,

vs = 2.0 eV. (a) < nsσ > = 0.06; (b) < nsσ > = 0.64; (c) < nsσ > = 0.98.

Abstract
A method for stochastic unraveling of general time-local quantum master equations (QMEs) is
proposed. The present kind of jump algorithm allows a numerically eﬃcient treatment of QMEs
which are not in Lindblad form, i.e. are not positive semideﬁnite by deﬁnition. The unraveling can
be achieved by allowing for trajectories with negative weights. Such a property is necessary, e.g.
to unravel the Redﬁeld QME and to treat various related problems with high numerical eﬃciency.
The method is successfully tested on the damped harmonic oscillator and on electron transfer
models including one and two reaction coordinates. The obtained results are compared to those
from a direct propagation of the reduced density matrix (RDM) as well as from the standard
quantum jump method. Comparison of the numerical eﬃciency is performed considering both the
population dynamics and the RDM in the Wigner phase space representation.

INTRODUCTION

Time-independent as well as time-dependent phenomena in chemical physics, quantum
optics, solid state physics, biological physics, etc. are often described using QMEs1,2.
In
particular, electron transfer (ET) dynamics in open quantum systems, i.e., systems with
dissipation, can be conveniently treated within this formalism. The QMEs govern the time
evolution of density matrices which are used in order to represent the mixed nature of the
states. Recently stochastic wave function methods have received a great deal of attention.
In unraveling schemes one considers an ensemble of stochastic Schr¨odinger equations (SSEs)
which in the limit of a large ensemble resemble the respective QME. Although all SSE
approaches have a common basis3 they are usually divided into two classes. One is the
quantum jump method also known as Monte Carlo wave function (MCWF) approach4,5,6,7,8.
In this approach the dynamics is described by a Schr¨odinger-like wave equation interrupted
by instantaneous deviations from the continuous motion (quantum jumps). The second class
of SSE approaches are the quantum diﬀusion models with continuous motion9,10 which are
not in the center of interest here. The numerical eﬀort for solving SSEs scales much more
favorably with the size of the basis than a direct propagation of a density matrix since one is
dealing with wave functions and not density matrices (for a comparison of direct integrators,
see Ref. 11). Thus, stochastic unraveling is an eﬃcient numerical tool for solving QMEs. Of
course, to achieve good statistics one has to average over a large number of wave functions.
So the SSE approaches become preferable for large and complex systems with many degrees
of freedom. In passing, we want to mention that in the present paper we are not interested
in establishing a relation between the SSE dynamics and some measurement process. Thus,
the treatment of single trajectories will be done without giving a special physical meaning
to them.

One of the important properties of a density matrix is the positive semi-deﬁniteness for
all times, i.e. that all populations are positive or zero. This property is fulﬁlled for QMEs
of the Lindblad form12 but not necessarily for reduced dynamics in general13,14. A slightly
generalized generator for a completely positive density-matrix evolution can be found in
Ref. 15 while a discussion on the non-Markovian case has been done in Ref. 16. Most of the
unraveling schemes4,6,9,10,17,18 have been restricted to QMEs of Lindblad form12 which ensures
that the RDM stays positive semideﬁnite for all times and all parameters. Nevertheless,
there are many physically meaningful QMEs which result in positive semideﬁnite RDMs
although they are not of Lindblad form19,20. The increasing interest in descriptions beyond
the Lindblad class such as the quantum Brownian motion19,21, the Redﬁeld formalism2,22,
non-Markovian schemes23,24,25, etc. resulted in various eﬀorts to develop new stochastic wave
function algorithms.

Strunz et al.19,21 extended the QME for Brownian motion to a non-Markovian QME and
then applied a quantum state diﬀusion algorithm. A similar approach was also proposed
by Gaspard et al.26. Recently Stockburger and Grabert27 developed a method for an exact
formulation of the RDM in terms of SSEs of a system coupled to a linear heat bath. Breuer et
al.25 extended a scheme which they had used to calculate multi-time correlation functions28
to the unraveling of QMEs. Their technique is based on doubling the Hilbert space. So

2

instead of a single stochastic wave function one has a pair of them25.
In this approach,
norm and Hermiticity are not preserved in single realizations but only in the ensemble
average which makes the algorithm unstable. Since stability and eﬃciency are crucial issues
for unraveling algorithms we propose an alternative approach which fulﬁlls these criteria.
Though the present approach has only been tested for Redﬁeld and Brownian-dynamics
master equations so far29 there are only few restrictions to its range of validity and it is
therefore applicable to a much larger class of time-local quantum master equations.

ET is commonly treated in modern theories with use of the RDM formalism and QMEs.
Alternatives to QMEs are, for example, semi-classical theories30, path integral methods31,32
and recently the self-consistent hybrid approach33,34,35. The latter was shown to treat suc-
cessfully the spin-boson problem33, the ET in mixed-valence compounds34,35 as well as the
heterogeneous ET at semiconductor surfaces35. Solving the QME for ET in model systems
with one36,37,38,39 and many reaction coordinates40 has been done with success. Exhaustive
reviews on ET can be found, e.g., in Refs. 41 and 42. Apart from the non-Markovian de-
scriptions of transfer phenomena23,43,44,45 the use of Redﬁeld theory for ET was investigated
as well11,37,38,46,47,48,49. The model used in the latter references is based on vibronically cou-
pled diabatic potentials which are suﬃciently well approximated by harmonic potentials. In
particular, the inﬂuence of the electronic coupling between the diabatic states on the dissipa-
tion was investigated. Neglecting this eﬀect results in the diabatic damping approximation
(DDA)46,47. This approximation as well as considering ﬁrst order perturbation theory in
the electronic coupling were objects of recent studies47. A typical problem that occurs with
increasing the complexity of the ET models, i.e. the dimension of the RDM, is the numerical
eﬀort. Thus, the stochastic unraveling of generalized time-local QME was developed with
the prospect of applications to more complex ET systems.

Recently the present scheme was brieﬂy demonstrated for the quantum Brownian motion
of a harmonic oscillator29. In the present paper the stochastic unraveling of the Redﬁeld
QME shall be considered in more detail as well as applications concerning multi-mode models
for ET shall be presented. In the next Section a brief introduction to the Redﬁeld formalism
will be given. Section III focuses on the derivation of the SSEs relevant for the generalized
time-local QME while Section IV will provide explicit expressions for the jump rates. In
Section V we describe three concrete applications of the proposed quantum jump method:
the damped harmonic oscillator and a model for ET with one and two reaction modes.
A study and discussion of the numerical eﬃciency in Section VI and a conclusion follow.
The detailed quantum jump algorithm used in the present contribution can be found in the
Appendix. Atomic units are used throughout the paper, i.e. ¯h = 1.

II. REDFIELD FORMALISM

In Redﬁeld theory the overall system is partitioned into a relevant system whose evolution

is of interest and a thermal bath using the Hamiltonian

H = HS + HB + HSB.

(1)

3

Here HS and HB are the Hamiltonians of the relevant system and of the bath while HSB
describes their interaction. In Subsec. V C it will be shown how this partitioning can be
rigorously performed. In general, the interaction part can be represented by bilinear products

HSB =

ΦmKm

(2)

m
X
of system and bath operators, Km and Φm, respectively. In the following Km and Φm will
be considered Hermitian. The state of the system is described by the RDM performing a
trace of the total density matrix σ over the bath degrees of freedom, i.e. ρ = trBσ. It is
assumed that the bath stays in thermodynamic equilibrium at all times. This means that
the relaxation of the bath is much faster than the evolution of the system. In addition, one
assumes that the system-bath interaction is suﬃciently small to be treated perturbatively to
second order. Using the Hamiltonian (1) and the assumptions described above one obtains
a non-Markovian QME for the RDM. One possible way to obtain a Markovian QME instead
is to neglect memory eﬀects which are due to the ﬁnite bath correlation time. The formal
treatment yields the Redﬁeld QME2,50

where Cmn(τ ) is the bath correlation function and K I
n the system operator in the interaction
picture. Usually it is easier to obtain the latter quantity in the frequency domain, e.g. with
use of molecular dynamics simulations or with a simple bath modeling. Either approach
yields the bath spectral density Jmn(ω) in terms of which the correlation function can be
constructed as2

with the Bose-Einstein distribution n(ω) = (eβω

the spectral density with exponential cut-oﬀ. However, a spectral density of Debye form can
be constructed which results in nearly the same values of Jmn(ω) for the speciﬁc spectrum
of HS used.

One way to obtain the Lindblad QME (6) is starting either from the non-Markovian QME
or from Eq. (4) and assuming a δ-correlated bath2,14, i.e., Cmn(τ )
cmnδ(τ ). Subsequent

diagonalization of the correlation matrix c by means of a unitary transformation c = U †κU,
yields Eq. (6) with Ln = √κn
m UnmKm. Alternatively, the Lindblad QME is obtained
when the DDA46,47 is invoked with the so-called rotating wave approximation (RWA) in the
system-bath coupling as done in the present paper. The explicit form of the corresponding
Lindblad operators used will be given in the sections below.

P

The Lindblad QME (6) will be used to compare the numerical eﬃciency of the present
quantum jump method method with the standard one4,6,9,10,17 by solving the single-mode
and the two-mode ET model. For more details of the DDA we refer to Refs. 46 and 47.

III. STOCHASTIC SCHR ¨ODINGER EQUATION

To start with the derivation of the unraveling scheme we ﬁrst like to formulate the time-

local QME in its most general form

dρ(t)
dt

= A(t)ρ(t) + ρ(t)A†(t)

k(t) + Ek(t)ρ(t)C †

k(t)

.

(7)

(cid:9)

Because A(t), Ck(t), and Ek(t) are arbitrary operators this equation conserves only Her-
miticity. In order to conserve also the norm further restrictions have to be applied as shown
below. All time arguments will be dropped henceforth for clarity.

The RDM will be recovered by averaging over an ensemble of two vectors

which are elements of the doubled Hilbert space, as

According to Ref. 3 Eq. (9) describes a quantum diﬀusion process if the leading terms in
k are of ﬁrst order in √dt. When dξi
dξi
k can be given by a ﬁnite number of values only, e.g.
√dt, the process results in continuous but random trajectories within each inﬁnitesimal
±
time interval dt (for dt
0 the trajectories become smooth but still stay noisy). In that way
one derives diﬀusion methods which will not be considered in the present work. However, if
k have ﬁnite values of order unity, i.e. zeroth order in √dt, Eq. (9) leads
the leading terms in dξi
to the so-called quantum jump methods which produce trajectories that are deterministic
during ﬁnite time intervals connected by discontinuous transitions (jumps). The jumps are
speciﬁed by their jump rates pi
k(t)
is the number of jumps in channel k due to term i up to time t, the probability for ni
k(t) to
k and (dni
increase by one, i.e. the expectation value of both dni

during the inﬁnitesimal time interval dt. This can be written as3

IV. JUMP RATES

Essential for the performance and particularly for the convergence behavior of the quan-
k and p2
tum jump method is how the jump rates p1
k are speciﬁed. They have no physical
meaning since in the average they do not inﬂuence any observable but determine the statis-
tical error. A detailed discussion on the optimization of the jump rates as free parameters
can be found in Ref. 52. Another freedom is that Eq. (7) is invariant with respect to a
Ek/f if f is a real, scalar function of
f Ck, Ek →
gauge transformation of the kind Ck →
time. Each single realization, and hence the stochastic process, is independent of this gauge
transformation and using such transformation oﬀers us no further advantages. We note that
the jump rates in Ref. 25 do not fulﬁll the invariance under this gauge transformation.

Following the approach in Ref. 52 we require that the norm of every single trajectory is

constant in time. Under such a condition expressed as

the pi
k are adapted at each moment of time. This approach yields a numerically stable and
eﬃcient algorithm. In contrast, numerical tests with jump rates adapted to other quantities
such as
, etc. resulted in an unstable scheme. The operators that enter the

Let us try to determine the jump rates from this condition. The total jump rate is obtained

An additional weight factor
(cid:12)
its sign every time a jump is performed with pi
˜pi
k. It can also be implemented (as
in the appendix) by allowing for negative norms of the trajectories. The change from ˜pi
k
to pi
k gives rise to a small deviation of the norm from unity because in the regions where
not all ˜pi
k are identical, norm conservation is no longer guaranteed, i.e. the sum of
the pi
k diﬀers from ˜p. As long as the occurrence of a jump is a very rare event and the
number of negative ˜pi
k is also very small the deviation from the initial norm is expected
to be small. In all tests this deviation was far below 1% without eﬀecting the numerical
eﬃciency of the proposed algorithm. This is how the scheme tolerates trajectories with
possibly negative weights which arise from the fact that the RDM with the QME (7) is not
necessarily positive semideﬁnite. If the RDM stays positive semideﬁnite during its entire
time evolution the negative weights are not needed, i.e. all trajectories can be normalized
to unity and represent physically relevant pure states. A possible implementation of the
present unraveling scheme is shown in the appendix.

In the examples below the RDM can exhibit negative eigenvalues. This nonphysical
situation could probably be improved by applying an initial slippage to the initial state14.
Another possibility to avoid non-positive semideﬁnite RDMs is to start with a derivation
of diﬀerent QMEs in the form (7) with time-dependent coeﬃcients.
It has been shown
that non-Lindblad QMEs with time-dependent coeﬃcients can preserve the positivity of the
RDM19,20. Nevertheless, an unraveling scheme has to be able to follow also the nonphysical
behavior of the QME because in the ensemble average the solution of the SSEs should
completely coincide with the exact solution of the QME.

V. APPLICATIONS OF THE PRESENT UNRAVELING METHOD

A. Damped harmonic oscillator

One of the most simple toy models used for testing in dissipative quantum dynamics is
the damped harmonic oscillator. Here it will be formulated within Redﬁeld theory, i.e. one
has to obtain the explicit form of the operators in Eq. (3). The oscillator has mass
M
and frequency ω0. If the thermal bath is modeled by quantum harmonic oscillators and the
system operator K is the oscillator coordinate q = (a + a†)/√2
ω0 the sum in Eq. (3)
contains only one term in which

ω0).
The damping rate Γ is related to the spectral density of the bath J(ω) as Γ = πJ(ω0)/(
Therefore, the explicit form of J(ω) is not necessary since the oscillator and the bath in-
terchange quanta only at the frequency ω0. Performing either the RWA53,54 or the secular
approximation2,54,55 Eq. (3) is transformed into a Lindblad QME (6). For the sake of simplic-
ity this will be shown here with the RWA for the harmonic oscillator but the generalization
for the ET model solved within the DDA is straightforward. Inserting the expressions for Λ
and K into Eq. (3), denoting b1 = a and b2 = a†, and performing some calculus the QME
obtains the form

(cid:19)

In order to transform Eq. (22) into Lindblad form either κ has to be diagonalized imposing
conditions for which the eigenvalues are positive56 or the RWA in the system-bath coupling54
has to be performed. It is easily seen that the determinant of κ is
1
4 and hence the former
method fails for this QME. Performing the RWA implies that the oﬀ-diagonal elements of
κ are set to zero. Then the Lindblad operators take the explicit form

−

L1 =

(n(ω0) + 1)Γa and L2 =

n(ω0)Γa† .

(24)

p

This result is easily generalized for the ET models discussed in the next two subsections. L1
and L2 have a clear physical interpretation. L1 damps all occupied levels bringing their pop-
ulations one level lower, while L2 has the opposite eﬀect. In the thermodynamic equilibrium
the jump rates for both operators are equal: the populations do not change.

p

To ﬁnd the operators involved in the generalized QME (7) (with M = 1 for the harmonic

oscillator) one has to carry out the commutators in Eq. (3). Then one can easily identify

C1 = K, E1 = Λ, A =

iHS −

KΛ.

(25)

(22)

(23)

In contrast to the Lindblad operators (24) the action of C1 and E1 on the wave function
is more subtle. This is why it is diﬃcult, and probably not possible, to assign a certain
physical process to a single trajectory.

In our stochastic simulation of the damped harmonic oscillator the temperature T = ω0/4
and Γ = ω0/10 are used. Figure 1 shows the population dynamics of the lowest four levels
of the oscillator starting from the pure initial state ρ33 = 1. As seen, the convergence to
the exact solution is very slow (104 trajectories are still not suﬃcient). On the other hand
the test system is very small and the QME can be solved very fast using direct propagators.
The true advantage of the method can be seen with larger systems, where it shows both a
faster convergence and a good scaling.

B. Electron transfer model with one reaction coordinate

Let us consider a model for electron transfer with the Hamiltonian47

HS = H (0) + V =

Hi|

i
ih

i
|

+ V

i
X

where Hi are the Hamiltonians of two harmonic oscillators (i.e., i = 1, 2) which describe the
vibronic spectrum of two electronic states interacting via the electronic coupling V . If the
system includes a single reaction coordinate q the vibronic Hamiltonians read

Hi = Ui + ωi(a†

i ai +

) +

(ai + a†

i ),

1

ωi∆i
√2

where ai and a†
i are the boson operators, ∆i the dimensionless displacements of the harmonic
potentials along the reaction coordinate, ωi the oscillator frequencies, and Ui the electronic
excitation energies. A very useful parameter of the system which is related to the last
term in Eq. (27) is the reorganization energy λi = ωi∆2
i /2. It is also proportional to the
vibronic coupling ωi∆i. Using the former expression one can deﬁne the potential minima
as U 0
λi. Conﬁgurations in which the potential minimum of the upper free-energy
i = Ui −
surface is lower in energy than the lower free-energy surface at that point are in the so-
If the opposite is true the conﬁguration is in the Marcus inverted
called normal region.
region. The electronic coupling v12 between the model potential surfaces is independent of
the coordinate. So the respective term in Eq. (26) obtains the explicit form

v12 = ω0. The reason for this choice is the intention to compare the standard and the new
quantum jump methods. As the Lindblad QME is obtainable only with RWA and DDA
one has to study a parameter region where both QMEs generate almost the same dynamics.
The bath is described by an Ohmic spectral density with cut-oﬀ frequency ωc = ω0 at
temperature kBT = ω0/4. The system-bath interaction is characterized by the damping
rate Γ = πη/(
exp(1)) = ω0/10 (see Ref. 47 for details). Again, the operators necessary
for the new quantum jump method are deﬁned according to Eq. (25).

A Gaussian wave packet located at the donor state

the relaxation of the ensemble-averaged donor population P1 =

A widely discussed property of the Redﬁeld equation is that it does not strictly conserve
positivity of the RDM54. Although P1 is always positive the tiny negative fraction in Fig. 3
is an evidence for the existence of single realizations with negative P1.
In contrast, the
simulation of the same system with the Lindblad operators (24) by means of the standard
quantum jump method4,6,9,10,17 keeps all values of P1 well conﬁned between 0 and 1.

Besides numerical eﬃciency, another advantage of the quantum trajectories is the better
insight into the quantum mechanisms underlying the overall dynamics of the ensemble.
Though it is impossible to give a direct physical interpretation of every single trajectory
one can extract information from the ensemble statistics. As we can see in Fig. 3 the
distribution of the individual expectation values of the population is skew and comprises
several maxima. One can better visualize the wave packet dynamics in phase space using
the Wigner representation of the RDM57 as done in Figs. 4 and 5. The evolution of the
expectation values of the momentum and the coordinate, which can be regarded as the
center of mass of the wave packet, is described by a path in phase space as shown in Fig. 6.
The wave packet starts oﬀ with zero momentum from the location of the excited state.
One can distinguish two stages of the ET dynamics. In the ﬁrst stage the wave packet splits
into several parts and occupies the whole accessible phase volume, i.e., it spreads (see Figs. 4
b, c and 5 b, c). The motion of the principal part of the wave packet, which is seen as a sharp
peak in Fig. 3, implies coherent transfer of population. The peak moves rapidly with time
in an oscillatory fashion while its amplitude decays as decoherence processes advance. After
that all parts of the wave packet coalesce to a single bell-shaped distribution. In the second
stage the wave packet continues to propagate slowly in phase space while its maximum is
it→∞. This slow motion is seen as a
it→∞ and
approaching the equilibrium point at
small drift to the right beginning from the central region of the spiral path (see Fig. 6). It is
due to dissipative transfer mechanisms47 and is small for barrierless potential conﬁgurations
as in the present case. We note also that in the time between the third population revival
and the 10th vibrational period (see Fig. 2) one can recognize a crossover between the two
stages discussed above. Such a moment of time is shown in Figs. 3, 4 and 5.

Unlike the trajectories considered in Ref. 19 within the quantum diﬀusion approach the

11

wave packet of one individual trajectory in our calculation spreads over the whole phase
volume of the system (Fig. 4 a). One reason for this discrepancy is the diﬀerent value used
for ¯h. Generally, for suﬃciently small ¯h the trajectories become classical states and virtually
shrink to points in phase space. However, the problem of their localization for small ¯h is
non-trivial because the system may be almost classical but with chaotic behavior.

C. Electron transfer model with multiple reaction coordinates

Modeling the system-bath separation one has to minimize the degrees of freedom in the
relevant system and the system-bath coupling simultaneously. The small polaron transfor-
mation has been used to eﬀectively reduce the system-bath coupling for a two-level spin-
boson system22. It also has been shown that this approach can be extended for multi-level
systems22. Alternatively, it is possible that one can successively take strongly coupled de-
grees of freedom from the bath and put them into the relevant-system part. This will make
the eﬀective system-bath coupling smaller and hence the application of the Redﬁeld theory
more reasonable. Multi-mode modeling of ET reactions, including systems in the inverted
region, has been done in Refs. 18,40, and 46 with similar argumentation. On the other
hand, there is experimental evidence for the participation of multiple modes in the ET tran-
sition in some systems, such as oxazine-1 in N,N-dimethylaniline58 and betaine-30 in various
solvents59. Correspondingly, the relevant part of the total ET system can be modeled with
a treatable small set of R reaction coordinates
. For this purpose one may select a set
of representative harmonic normal modes from the molecule and from its environment (e.g.
the solvent or the crystal lattice). Since all normal modes are decoupled one can use the
single-mode operators to calculate the matrix elements of the necessary operators in the
diabatic basis

. The Hamiltonian of each diabatic electronic state reads

The multi-mode model can be easily reduced to an eﬀective single-mode model by means
of an orthogonal transformation60,61 of the Hamiltonian H (0). For two diabatic states with
equal curvatures one can drop the electronic index. Denoting the relative displacement by
∆l the transformation has the form61

One can see that all R normal modes are transformed to a ﬁnite bath with R
1 modes
with frequencies Ωk. A new eﬀective mode with frequency Ω0 and displacement ∆0 is
created which is bilinearly coupled to the new bath modes. From Eq. (35) it follows that
∆0Ω0 <
l ∆lωl for positive coordinate displacements, i.e. the vibronic coupling of the new
eﬀective mode is smaller than the total vibronic coupling of the initial normal modes. Thus,
a reduction from a multi-mode to a single-mode model extends the bath and enlarges the
system-bath coupling. This reduction is unique. On the other hand, the addition of a bath
mode to the relevant system is not unique. It depends on the choice of a certain bath mode.
Nevertheless, it always reduces the system-bath coupling and enlarges the total vibronic
coupling of the relevant system.

In the following, a two-mode ET model will be considered. The frequencies of the two
modes were chosen 0.07 and 0.18 eV, and the reorganization energies 0.33 and 0.82 eV,
respectively. These frequencies correspond to internal molecular modes in real ET systems.
The eﬀective mode was calculated using Eq. (35). The change of the free energy was taken
to be U 0
0.2 eV and the electronic coupling between the diabatic electronic states
v12 = 0.1 eV. Again, a harmonic bath with an Ohmic spectral density was considered
with damping rate Γ = 0.007 eV and temperature 295 K. 16 levels for each mode gave
a good convergence. Initially, the lowest vibrational level of the excited state is populated
(Fig. 7). The coherent dynamics of the excited state of the eﬀective mode model yields small
population in the ground state. This is followed by an almost complete revival at about 110

fs. In contrast, the two-mode model exhibits an ultrafast coherent population transfer to
the ground state. Recurrences of population in the excited state appear many times within
120 fs but their yield does not exceed 50 %. As the two-mode system can be regarded as a
conservative two-particle system its complete recurrence period (Poincare’s cycle) is much
longer than that for the single-mode system. In a way the isolated two-mode system shows
a relaxation behavior that is typical for open systems.

Turning on the dissipation leads to irreversible transfer to the lower state. However,
the picture does not change qualitatively as the dissipative transfer mechanism does not
contribute signiﬁcantly at the early times shown here. As already found46,47 and seen in
Fig. 7 the DDA has also no serious inﬂuence on the early dynamics. As the DDA has been
recently well studied we have put the focus here on the ultrafast initial stage where the
diﬀerence between the single-mode model and the two-mode model is best characterized.

VI. EFFICIENCY AND STABILITY

To estimate the convergence and hence the stability of the proposed scheme one needs
an appropriate measure for the convergence. Unraveling the QME one aims to calculate
the time evolution of an observable, e.g. the population P1, performing an average over Ns
single trajectories. At time tj the average reads

P1(tj, Ns −

where Nt is the total number of propagation time steps. In this convergence measure we use
k trajectories. For convenience the increment
as reference the average performed over Ns −
k can be chosen to be the number of computing nodes in a parallel implementation of the
stochastic algorithm. One can easily see that ε vanishes for large Ns if both terms in the
). If these two terms diverge with increasing Ns the scheme
sum converge to P1(tj, Ns → ∞
is instable. Therefore ε is suﬃcient for estimating the convergence and stability limits. The
measure ε used here is very similar to the absolute error measure β for the unraveling schemes
which has been used for studying standard ﬁrst- and higher-order unraveling schemes8. The
only diﬀerence between them is the reference calculation – for calculating the error β one
considers the exact solution produced numerically by some direct propagator or analytically.
It was found8 that for a small number of samples Ns the error measure β is mainly statistical
due to the ﬁnite sample size. For large Ns the error due to the ﬁnite time step starts to
dominate. Since both terms in the sum in Eq. (41) carry the same time-step error it will
cancel out in the error measure ε. Thus our convergence measure is a criterion for the
statistical error of the stochastic scheme.

14

Considering the eﬃciency of the stochastic method it is convenient to look at the relation
between numerical eﬀort and achieved convergence. When the DDA is invoked together
with the RWA in the system-bath coupling one can obtain the Lindblad form (6) that can
be solved by the standard quantum jump method4,6,8,9,10,17 as well as by the present one. In
this way the numerical performance of both methods can be compared. Figure 8 shows the
behavior of ε for k = 8 with increasing number of trajectories for the ET example with one
reaction coordinate. Within Redﬁeld theory the variation of Γ towards large system-bath
coupling values is of limited validity. So the Redﬁeld QME does not allow to verify the
new scheme in the strong coupling regime. However, we performed the calculations for two
values for Γ (0.1ω0 and 0.01ω0) that are supposed to belong to the weak coupling regime. In
addition, the computation was performed for two propagation time steps δt. It was found
that for Γδt
0.1 the proposed scheme becomes unstable. As can be seen in Fig. 8 decreasing
Γδt has no inﬂuence on the convergence ε. The slope of ε in the double logarithmic scale
1, i.e. the scheme converges as 1/Ns. When simulating other,
(d log ε/d log Ns) in Fig. 8 is
physically diﬀerent systems we expect the convergence behavior to be not too diﬀerent from
the example studied here. At least the proportionality to 1/Ns will stay unchanged. The only
diﬀerence can be the intercept of ε (i.e. the value of log epsilon for log Ns = 0) which may
have some physical reasoning. We expect some change in the instability limit for Γδt
0.1
with the type of system studied. This topic has to be explored in future studies, especially
for QMEs which allow larger variation of the system-bath coupling.

Now let us discuss the dependence on the basis size. It is well known that the numerical
eﬀort for solving QMEs with the quantum jump method and with direct propagators scales
quadratically and cubically, respectively, with the basis size
. Thus, for both high accuracy
and lower numerical expense stochastic methods would only be preferred over direct propa-
gators if the number of trajectories Ns is much smaller than
. We shall examine the scaling
behavior by solving the one-dimensional ET model with the use of the present stochastic
scheme for both the Redﬁeld QME (3) and the Lindblad QME (6) as well as the standard
scheme for the Lindblad QME (6). All runs were performed with increasing basis size and
compared to a direct propagation. For this purpose we choose the short iterative Arnoldi
propagator11,22,50 in a Krylov space of dimension 12. As expected, the numerical expense for
a few trajectories is much smaller than for the direct propagator. But for converged results
one needs much more that one trajectory. When the number of trajectories necessary for
the complete convergence is greater than
one has to make a trade-oﬀ between the accu-
racy achieved with the stochastic method and the numerical eﬀort. For the comparison we
choose as an example Ns = 500 for which the convergence is not yet complete. In Fig. 2
we have seen that this sample size already yields qualitatively the same result as the direct
propagator. For very accurate calculations one needs a much larger number of trajectories.
The crossing point in Fig. 9 shows that for
212 the new stochastic algorithm should
N
be preferred. In addition one gets a beneﬁt from the eﬃcient parallel implementation of the
stochastic algorithm which is of great practical use especially when one is asking for fast pre-
liminary results for the dynamics of large systems. The slope of the lines in Fig. 9 reﬂecting
the scaling of the numerical eﬀort for the stochastic methods is approximately 2.3 and for
the direct propagation 3.2. These scalings are larger than the theoretical estimates of 2 and

In the following the intercept of the curves for the numerical eﬀort in Fig. 9, i.e. the CPU-
time extrapolated to
= 1, is examined. The ratio of the intercepts between the proposed
stochastic scheme for the Redﬁeld QME and the standard scheme for the Lindblad QME is
found to be 2.4 (see Fig. 9). The respective ratio between the proposed stochastic scheme for
the Redﬁeld QME and the same scheme for the Lindblad QME is 4.4. This can be interpreted
as follows. Neglecting the operations of lower order the intercept in a double logarithmic
plot like in Fig. 9 has to be proportional to the number of matrix-vector multiplications for
one time step, i.e. the intercept holds to some extent information speciﬁc for each stochastic
scheme. Considering only the deterministic part of the implemented algorithm (see the
Appendix for details) each time step requires 4M + 9 matrix-vector multiplications (for
M operations for computing the jump rates Eq. (20), eight
M dissipative channels, 4
operations for time propagation and one for calculating the population) versus only 5 for
the standard jump algorithm (four operations for time propagation and one for calculating
the population). Nevertheless, the values found from the simulation (Fig. 9), 12/5 and 22/5,
deviate from the estimates 13/5 and 17/5, respectively, due to systematic eﬀects like lower-
order operations for not very large
as well as due to stochastic eﬀects like the varying
number of quantum jumps. To summarize, for the Lindblad QME the standard algorithm
is the method of choice, while for the Redﬁeld QME, where one cannot apply the standard
method, one has to cope with the larger numerical expense. The latter can be signiﬁcantly
reduced when high accuracy is not necessary.

VII. CONCLUSION

In this paper the stochastic unraveling technique was extended for non-Lindblad QMEs.
This progress became possible with the use of the wave-function pair in the doubled Hilbert
space and the derivation of stable, almost normalized SSEs. An eﬃcient ﬁrst-order quantum
jump algorithm was proposed. The eﬃciency is determined by the behavior of the norm of
every single trajectory. In this sense the jump rates were used as parameters to inﬂuence
the eﬃciency.

Occurrence of negative population for single trajectories is by no means a problem of the
proposed unraveling scheme. Rather it is related to the fact that the QMEs (3, 7) do not
preserve the RDM positive semi-deﬁnite. It is known14 that the negative eigenvalues of the
RDM in the Redﬁeld theory arise from the inconsistency between the initial RDM and the
bath state, i.e. due to neglected initial correlations in the Born-Markov approximation. A
satisfactory resolution of this problem is the slippage of the initial conditions as derived by
Gaspard et al.14. In this method the so called slippage superoperator takes into account
the short-time bath correlations. Applied to the initial RDM it introduces the necessary
correlations into the initial state. This manipulation of the initial state ensures propagation
of a positive semideﬁnite RDM at any further moment of time.

The method proposed was successfully tested for the Redﬁeld QME for the damped

harmonic oscillator and two ET models.
eﬃcient quantum dynamical simulations of large systems. The most important beneﬁt of
the method is that it can be applied in a straightforward manner since the SSEs and the
expressions of the jump rates are formally the same for other models of system and bath.
Therefore, a potential use of the proposed method can be made in simulations involving
any kind of non-Markovian QMEs provided that they are in a time-local form like in the
time-convolutionless formalism25 as well as in methods using auxiliary density matrices to
include the memory eﬀects24.

Each individual trajectory occupies nearly the whole volume in phase space accessible
for the system. It would be of possible interest to see whether the phase-space volume of
a single trajectory shrinks with decreasing ¯h and to study the classical behavior of the ET
system.

The deterministic propagation of the wave functions in this work was performed with the use
of a forth-order Runge-Kutta method62. Accordingly, one time step requires four matrix-
vector multiplication for each wave function. The ensemble-averaged expectation value of
an observable A is calculated as

The method can be parallelized using MPI63. In such an implementation every single
stochastic trajectory is propagated by a diﬀerent process. Only the averaging operation
(43) is done at certain times by means of collective communications. In this way the task
can be eﬃciently distributed on a cluster of PCs.

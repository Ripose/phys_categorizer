Abstract

A theory of vibrational energy relaxation based on a semiclassical treatment

of the quantum master equation is presented. Using new results on the semi-

classical expansion of dipole matrix elements, we show that in the classical

limit the master equation reduces to the Zwanzig energy diﬀusion equation.

The leading quantum corrections are determined and discussed for the har-

monic and Morse potentials.

I. INTRODUCTION

Vibrational energy relaxation (VER) is of fundamental importance for many chemical

reactions in solution1,2. VER studies in molecules like I2, HgI, O2, and N2 in various solvents

by means of pulsed laser techniques cover a range of relaxation times from picoseconds to

seconds2. A detailed theoretical description is often complicated by the fact that various

energy relaxation processes contribute. While in the high frequency regime a quantum

mechanical treatment, e. g., on the basis of the isolated binary collision model is natural, the

low frequency regime has for the most part been treated in terms of classical theories such as
the Landau-Teller model, the generalized Langevin equation, or by molecular dynamics3–5.

These approaches are justiﬁed for high temperatures and heavier molecules.

However, in some of the above mentioned molecules in solution as well as for adsorbates

on surfaces, molecules in cryogenic matrices, or molecular crystals, purely classical theories

are not suﬃcient and quantum eﬀects cannot be disregarded. This is also due to the fact

that experiments have to be performed at low temperatures where only few vibrational levels

are occupied. For these systems, VER was mostly treated on the basis of Fermi’s golden

rule and the quantum master equation6,7.

One of the questions arising in this context is the connection between the quantum

mechanical theory of VER and classical energy relaxation. To address this problem, we

give here a semiclassical analysis of the quantum master equation. The Zwanzig energy

diﬀusion equation4 is recovered in the classical limit and the dominant quantum corrections

are determined explicitly.

The paper is organized as follows. In section II we introduce the microscopic model which

is a nonlinear oscillator coupled to a bath of harmonic oscillators. This model is known to

lead in the classical limit to the generalized Langevin equation. Molecular dynamics simu-

lation suggest that the model can also be used for rather complicated relaxation processes,

such as e.g., a binary molecule in a Lennard-Jones ﬂuid, if the parameters of the harmonic

oscillator bath are chosen appropriately5. We brieﬂy discuss the classical limit of the model,

2

and its weak-coupling limit, which leads to the Zwanzig energy diﬀusion equation. Further,

the fully quantum mechanical treatment of VER on the basis of a master equation is given.

Section III is devoted to the semiclassical expansion of the master equation. This re-

quires, apart from known expansions of wave functions and energy levels, explicit results on

semiclassical dipole matrix elements. On the basis of these results we then show that the

master equation reduces to the classical energy diﬀusion equation in the limit ¯h

0, and

→

determine the leading quantum corrections. Section IV contains explicit results for the cases

of the harmonic and Morse potentials, and in section V we present our conclusions.

II. THE MODEL AND FORMULATION OF THE PROBLEM

Vibrational motion of molecules can be modeled as the motion of a particle in an anhar-

monic potential well V (q). To account for dissipation we couple the particle to a bath of

harmonic oscillators8. Of course, the harmonic oscillator bath is a crude simpliﬁcation of the

real interaction of molecular vibrations with the solvent. However, inasmuch as the back-

action of the solvent can be treated within linear response theory, the bath can be modeled

in terms of eﬀective bath oscillators. In fact, this simple model describes the classical dy-

namics of a binary molecule in a Lennard-Jones ﬂuid quite accurately5. For the problem of

energy relaxation we expect the harmonic oscillator bath to be a reasonable starting point.

With these premises, the Hamiltonian H is composed of the oscillator part

undamped oscillations about the minimum of the potential well, a typical damping strength

Further, we may introduce a typical memory delay time

classical Langevin equation in terms of energy and phase variables.

The unperturbed trajectory q(E, t) of energy E satisfying

may be written as a Fourier series

where

Φ(t) = ω(E)t.

Here 2π/ω(E) is the oscillation period of a trajectory of energy E in the potential well. The

phase will be chosen such that for Φ = 0 the trajectory is at a turning point. Then the

Fourier coeﬃcients are real and satisfy

Now, relation (13) and

mation, the Langevin equation may be written in terms of energy and phase4,9,10. These

transformed equations may be solved perturbatively to second order in the coupling to the

bath. Within the time window

equation

In the weak damping limit considered here, the so-called counter-term, that is the second

term of HSB in Eq. (3), may be disregarded. The master equation (22) is appropriate for

weak damping satisfying condition (10).

In addition, for the quantum system a further

6

frequency scale set by the lowest Matsubara frequency ν

2πkBT /¯h becomes relevant. As

≡

can be seen from the derivation of the Pauli master equation, bath correlation functions are

assumed to decay on a time scale much shorter than 1/γc (see for instance Ref. 11). For

low temperatures where ν < 1/τc bath correlations decay on the time scale 1/ν. Hence, in

addition to Eq. (10) we have to require

which is, however, usually obeyed for systems of relevance in chemical physics.

Due to the linearity of the bath, the transition rate may be evaluated exactly yielding

We now want to regain the Zwanzig energy diﬀusion equation from the Pauli master

equation and determine the leading quantum corrections. The results of this somewhat

lengthy calculation are summarized at the beginning of section IV. We start by introducing

the probability distribution function

by means of which expectation values are simply calculated as

The solution to the two turning point problem we are facing here is a linear combination

of these right and left traveling waves. Details of the analytic structure of these functions

are discussed in the literature12. Here we only mention that the quantization condition is

obtained as

to enclose the two turning points at energy E. Deﬁning the function

Nsc(E) = n, n = 0, 1, 2, . . . .

The semiclassical energy eigenvalues Esc(n) (n = 0, 1, 2, . . .) are then obtained by inverting

Eq. (44). Now, the semiclassical expansion of Eq. (43) gives12

Truncation of the series (45) at order ¯h reproduces the Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization con-

dition. Note that it is necessary to distinguish the semiclassical quantity Nsc(E) from the

exact N(E) which is a staircase function. For potentials where the series expansion (45)

terminates at some ﬁnite order, Nsc(E) smoothly interpolates between the sharp steps of

N(E). Similarly, the exact quantum mechanical density ρ(E) has to be distinguished from

the smooth semiclassical level density

Despite the fact that the expansion (90) of Wl(E) starts with a term of order ¯h−2, the

series expansion in ¯h of the rhs of Eq. (96) does not contain terms of order ¯h−1 since they

vanish due to the symmetry of γc(lω(E)) and Q(0)

P (E) =

(107)

Here Ω(E) is a generalized oscillation frequency containing quantum corrections as deﬁned

in Eq. (49). Λ(E) is given in Eq. (106) and contains the obvious quantum corrections to

19

the classical energy relaxation coeﬃcient. The functions Φ(E) and χ(E) were introduced in

Eqs. (105) and (103), respectively. Apart from the classical quantities ω(E), Q(0)

l (E), and

ˆγ(z) that are ingredients of the classical Zwanzig equation, one merely needs to calculate

J2(E) given in Eq. (46) and the second order quantum correction Q(2)

l (E) of the dipole matrix

element given in Eq. (63) in order to determine the generalized Fokker-Planck operator in

Eq. (107) explicitly. Since one can show that the equilibrium solution (84) is a stationary

solution of Eq. (107), the only non-trivial quantum correction that survives in equilibrium

is seen to be the quantity J2(0).

In the case of an Ohmic bath, i.e. γc(ω) = γ, the coeﬃcients become particularly simple.

Given the functions ω, J2, and B(0/2)

B. Morse oscillator

The fact that the relaxation time is unaﬀected by quantum eﬀects is of course a special

feature of the simple harmonic potential (110). As an example of a more realistic model

for VER we consider a damped Morse oscillator. This system plays an important role in

the modeling of, e.g., diatomic molecular systems. The Hamiltonian of the Morse oscillator

reads

H =

h

−

i

(127)

where D0 is the dissociation energy, r0 the nuclear distance at equilibrium, and κ−1 the range

of the molecular potential. Here, the P = Mdr/dτ is the classical momentum. In terms of

the scaled variables q = κ(r

r0), p = P/√2D0M, t = τ κ

2D0/M the Hamiltonian takes

−

q

the form

Note that now ¯h is dimensionless and stands for ¯hκ/√2D0M. The classical trajectory for a

bound particle with energy E < 1/2 is found by solving

Here we have assumed that the particle is at a turning point at t = 0. From this result it is

From Eq. (148) one sees that quantum corrections lower the relaxation rate since the mean

thermal energy is raised by zero point motion. Usually this eﬀect is accounted for by the

deﬁnition of the relaxation time T1 according to

Contrary to the harmonic case ωJ0 6
high energies where anharmonicities are important. The usual concept of a relaxation time

= E, and the energy relaxation is non-exponential for

is thus no longer strictly valid. Eq. (150) may, however, serve in connection with Eq. (148)

to deﬁne an initial relaxation rate 1/T1. For the classical relaxation time one then ﬁnds for

from where it is readily seen that the classical relaxation time increases as the initial energy

increases, consistent with the fact that the period increases with energy. The semiclassical

corrections to the relaxation time are then found by using Eqs. (85) and (86). The leading

order correction to Eq. (151) is found to read

from where the classical and harmonic limits are readily recovered by setting ¯h = 0 and

J0(E0) = E0, respectively. With the rates deﬁned in this way, we now ﬁnd an acceleration

of the relaxation process by quantum ﬂuctuations.

To investigate the quality of the semiclassical energy diﬀusion equation in some detail,

we compare with results of the full master equation. Since for the Morse potential exact

dipole matrix elements are available15, the initial energy relaxation rate may be calculated

using

Figure 1 compares the relaxation rates R(n0) for the parameters ¯h = 0.0943, β = 20 (ten

bound states) and ¯h = 0.0198, β = 100 (50 bound states). Since Nsc(

ieq) = 0.27 and 0.17,
respectively, in equilibrium only the ground state is populated substantially. Hence, R(n) is

E

h

negative for n = 0 only. The ﬁgure shows that for higher states the classical rates agree well

with the quantum results. For low-lying states, however, while the classical approximation

fails the semiclassical rates are still in good agreement with the master equation prediction.

V. CONCLUSIONS

We have given a systematic semiclassical theory of vibrational energy relaxation based on

the quantum master equation. Speciﬁcally, we have studied a model leading to a generalized

Langevin equation in the classical limit, which is the basis of much of the earlier work. An

expansion in powers of ¯h (more speciﬁcally, in powers of ¯hω0/kBT , where ¯hω0/2 is the

vibrational zero point energy) was shown to yield the Zwanzig energy diﬀusion equation and

quantum corrections thereof. For a harmonic potential, the energy relaxation time is not

aﬀected by quantum ﬂuctuations while it can be reduced for nonlinear potentials. For the

Morse potential the improved energy diﬀusion equation was shown to incorporate the main

quantum eﬀects.

Abstract

We report the spontaneous formation of a GaP fullerene cage in ab-initio
Molecular Dynamics simulations starting from a bulk fragment. A systematic
study of the geometric and electronic properties of neutral and ionized GaP
clusters suggests the stability of hetero-fullerenes formed by a compound with
zincblend bulk structure. We ﬁnd that GaP fullerenes up to 28 atoms have
high symmetry, closed electronic shells, large HOMO-LUMO energy gaps and
do not dissociate when ionized. We compare our results for GaP with those
obtained by other groups for the corresponding BN clusters.

The discovery of carbon fullerenes and nanotubes [1,2] has opened a completely new
ﬁeld at the borderline between chemistry and physics leading to many new phenomena and
applications.

Up to now, most eﬀorts to identify fullerenes based on other elements have focused on
BN which is the most similar to carbon and exists in nature in the hexagonal(graphite-like)
structure [3–10]. However, the (nested-)cages and wires found for this material [3,4] do not
resemble any of the small preferred structures of the carbon fullerene family, particularly
due to the absence of the characteristic pentagonal rings. Besides, nanotubes based on other
layered materials, such as GaSe [11] and black-phosphorus [12], have been theoretically pre-
dicted to be stable. On the basis of density functional calculations it has also been proposed
that GaN nanotubes could be synthesised by using carbon nanotubes as a nucleation seed
[13].

One intriguing question is whether fullerene cages could be realized in typical semicon-
ductors of the III-V family, like GaAs, InSb or GaP, which do not possess a graphite-like
bulk structure. These materials are not considered as good candidates for hollow structures
since π bonding should be less eﬀective in these larger atoms of higher rows of the periodic
table than in the ﬁrst one [5].

In this letter we show, by means of ab-initio Car-Parrinello Molecular Dynamics [14], that
a small GaP bulk fragment spontaneously organizes in a cage formed by a diﬀerent number
of atoms of the two elements arranged as in carbon fullerenes. We discuss the geometric
and electronic structure of GaP cages with either the same or a diﬀerent number of atoms
of the two species. Our results strongly suggest that small GaP fullerenes could be stable,
since they have high symmetry, closed electronic shells, large HOMO-LUMO energy gaps
and do not dissociate when ionized. We give quantitative estimates of the relative stability
of cages formed either by hexagons and pentagons as in carbon fullerenes or by hexagons
and squares as proposed for BN [5–9].

Our results are obtained by the Car-Parrinello approach [14] using a Density Functional
in the Generalized Gradient Approximation proposed by Becke and Perdew [15,16]. This
approximation reproduces the experimental cohesive energy of typical bulk semiconductors
within ≈ 5% and underestimates the valence to conduction band excitation energies [17].
We use nonlocal norm-conserving ﬁrst-principles pseudopotentials [18] and expand the single
particle wavefunctions on a plane wave basis set with a cut-oﬀ of 12 Rydberg. We use a
periodically repeated cubic simulation box of 24 ˚A side, so that periodic images are at least
14 ˚A apart. We have veriﬁed that this size is large enough to describe isolated clusters. The
electronic optimization and structural relaxation have been performed using damped second
order dynamics with electronic mass preconditioning scheme [19,20]. We use throughout an
integration time step of 8 a.u. The symmetry of the equilibrium structure is not biased but it
is reached spontaneously during the geometry optimization starting from the corresponding
regular polyhedron.

The process of formation of the fullerene cage with 28 atoms from a larger bulk-like
cluster of 41 atoms (Ga28P13) is shown in Fig.1, with the help of three snapshots taken
during the structural energy minimization which leads to the appearance of the Ga16P12
fullerene cage [21]. The cage has 12 pentagons and 6 hexagons and Td symmetry as C28. An
analysis of the charge distribution shows 108 valence electrons on the bonded cage, exactly
the number which corresponds to the neutral Ga16P12 cluster [22]. Finally in Fig.1d we show

2

the equilibrium structure of the neutral Ga16P12 cluster alone.

The observed spontaneous formation of a Ga16P12 cage with pentagons is surprising
since, in the case of BN [5–8], (deformed) squares are found to be energetically much more
favorable. For B12N12
[6], there is an energy diﬀerence of 9 eV between the cage with
pentagons and the one with squares in favor of the latter which contains only heteropolar
bonds and is favored for a material composed by atoms with very diﬀerent electronegativity
as B and N. Therefore, most studies have considered cages BnNn formed by hexagons closed
by square rings [5,6,8,9]. Very recently, Fowler et al. [10] have pointed out that, among the
cages with pentagons, those with one species in excess of 4 atoms (BnNn+4) minimize the
number of homopolar bonds. It is remarkable that the cage Ga16P12 which spontaneously
appear in our simulation falls into this class.

We have studied the equilibrium structure and electronic states of clusters with 20 and 28
atoms of the type IIInVn±4 , namely Ga12P8, Ga8P12, Ga16P12 and Ga12P16, and compared
them to clusters with the same number of III and V atoms, namely Ga10P10 and Ga12P12,
the latter in the two isomers [6] with hexagons closed either by ﬁve- or four-sided faces.
The minimum energy structures of Ga16P12 and Ga12P16 are found to have Td symmetry,
whereas those of Ga12P8 and Ga8P12 have Th symmetry. Among the clusters GanPn, the
Ga12P12 with 4-membered rings belongs to Th whereas those with pentagons present very
large distortions around the lower C3v symmetry. The structural parameters of the cages
belonging either to Th or to Td are given in Table I. Hexagons are found with alternating
angles of 880
−1260, ∼ 1000,
∼ 1100 and deformed squares with angles 750 and 980. Ga-P distances are in general shorter
2 bonding. The radial distance r from the
than in bulk compounds due to predominant sp
center of the cluster given in Table I indicates a tendency of the anion to occupy positions
at larger distances from the center than the cation, as found for ultrasmall cluster [23,24].
As in the case of carbon and BN fullerenes, the GaP clusters would represent metastable
states with respect to the bulk equilibrium structure. Therefore only experimental obser-
vation can establish with certainty their existence. Nevertheless, there are a few quantities
which are used in the literature as indicators of stability. We support our prediction for the
stability of the examined GaP clusters by using the following indicators: i) closed electronic
shells and large energy gaps; ii) cohesive energy; iii) thermal stability; iv) stability of the
ionized clusters.

−1340, pentagons with angles of 850

The ﬁrst indicator of chemical stability is the energy gap between the highest occupied
and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (HOMO and LUMO). In carbon fullerenes a cor-
relation between this energy and the observed fullerenes has been experimentally veriﬁed
[25]. In Table II we give the calculated HOMO-LUMO energy gap and the cohesive energy
for all the clusters studied. Among the cages with pentagons the highest energy gaps are
for cluster with P in excess of 4, a composition which has been suggested to be favorable
also for BN [10]. However, a very large gap is also found for the Ga12P12 with squares.

A comparison of the binding energies per atom between the GaP cages and the zincblend
bulk phase of this material is possible only for the clusters with the same number of Ga and
P atoms. From the results of Table II, we ﬁnd that the cohesive energies per atom for
Ga12P12 with squares, Ga12P12 with pentagons, and Ga10P10 are about 10% lower than in
the bulk. This result is very close to that found for BN and carbon fullerenes of the same
size [5].

We have studied the thermal stability of two clusters with very diﬀerent energy gaps,
namely Ga12P8 and Ga8P12 (see Table II). For both clusters we have performed two annealing
cycles of about 3 ps, up to 1500 K and up to 2000 K. The system is heated with a rate
of 2×1015K/s, then equilibrated for one ps at the highest temperature, and ﬁnally cooled
down with the same temperature change rate. For Ga8P12 no bond breaking or structural
rearrangements occur in both cycles and the structure comes back to the same minimum
energy conﬁguration when the temperature is lowered. This is also the case for Ga12P8 in
the annealing up to 1500 K, whereas at 2000 K some structural rearrangement takes place
leading to a distorted structure with higher energy when cooled down. These results indicate
that the thermal stability is correlated with the width of the energy gap.

Mass spectrometry experiments use the diﬀerence in mass-to-charge ratio of ionized
atoms or clusters to select them. Therefore one basic requirement for the possible detection
of such clusters is that they remain stable also when ionized. We have investigated the
stability of some positively ionized clusters, [Ga8P12]+, [Ga12P16]+ and [Ga16P12]+. We have
included an uniform charge background in order to have an overall neutral system in the
supercell calculation. The electronic structure remains almost unaﬀected and degeneracies
are broken by negligible amounts in the order of hundredths of eV. Only minor structural
distortions occur upon ionization. In particular, the six equivalent P-P (Ga-Ga) bond lengths
split into three diﬀerent classes. Remarkably, during a molecular dynamics run for [Ga8P12]+
we observe a dynamical exchange between these three classes of bond lengths with each other.
This eﬀect produces features in the low frequency vibrational spectrum in the range 30 −120
cm−1 which might be detected by infrared multiphoton ionization spectra [26].

It is interesting to compare cages closed either by 4- or 5-membered rings. As already
mentioned, such a comparison has been done for B12N12 in Ref. [6]. However there are
no results comparing clusters with equal number of atoms IIInVn with square rings to the
more favorable structures with pentagons of the type IIInVn+4. The authors who have
proposed the latter stoichiometry [10], in fact, do not give a comparison to cages with
square rings. Although it is impossible to compare directly the cohesive energy of structures
with a diﬀerent number of atoms of each species, we are in a position to give an estimate of
the bond energy for the two types of cages. Given the number of each type of bond in all
the structures with pentagons studied so far and the values of the total cohesive energy, we
estimate by a best ﬁt the following energies per bond: EGa−P = -2.593 eV, EGa−Ga=-1.133 eV,
EP −P =-2.349 eV [27]. As shown in Table II, these values yield the correct cohesive energy
with a relative error of 0.4% at most for all cluster with pentagons, whereas overestimate
the cohesive energy of the cluster Ga12P12 with squares. In this cluster, in fact, there are
only Ga-P bonds yielding directly EGa−P =-2.499 eV a smaller value than in the clusters
with pentagons. However, as it can be seen in Table II, it is the isomer with squares which
has the lowest energy among the two Ga12P12. The 1.9 eV energy diﬀerence between them
is much less than the 9 eV found for B12N12 [6]. This is most probably due to the less ionic
character of the GaP bonds. The diﬀerence in electronegativity of Ga and P is in fact ∼ 0.4
against ∼ 1 for BN. The observed spontaneous formation in our simulations of a cage with
the same topology of C28 shows a possible evolution pattern from ionized bulk fragments to
classical fullerene cages formed by pentagons and hexagons.

In summary, we have shown, by means of ab-initio Car-Parrinello Molecular Dynamics,
that small GaP fullerenes have highly symmetric structures, closed electronic shells and large

4

HOMO-LUMO gaps and cohesive energy. These clusters are thermally stable and remain in
the same structure also when ionized. These ﬁndings together with the observed spontaneous
formation in our simulations of a 28 atoms cage with the same symmetry of C28 support
the possible existence of GaP fullerenes. We hope that our work will stimulate experimental
groups to widen their search for hetero-fullerenes also to III-V compound semiconductors.

TABLE II. HOMO-LUMO gap and cohesive energy of the clusters studied. For reference, the
indirect energy gap of bulk GaP within the Local Density Approximation is 1.62 eV. The cohesive
energy is obtained as the diﬀerence of the total energy minus the energy of the isolated pseudoatoms.
Within the same approximations these values are -2.15045 Hartree and -6.46295 Hartree for Ga

FIG. 1. Ga atoms are represented as large light balls, P atoms as small dark balls. Start-
ing from a truncated bulk structure with tetrahedral symmetry, Fig.1a shows a ﬁrst step in the
evolution towards structural energy minimization. The main rearrangement is the bonding of the
peripheral Ga atoms between themselves, 12 atoms in pairs on the edges of the tetrahedron and
four triplets on the vertices. In Fig.1b the central P atom breaks its bonds, followed by 12 Ga
atoms (Fig1.c) leading to the formation of a Ga16P12 fullerene cage. Fig.1d shows the equilibrium
structure of the neutral Ga16P12 cluster alone. Notice the non-planarity of the pentagons. The
symmetry of the equilibrium conﬁguration is Td (see Table I).

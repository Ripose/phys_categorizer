Abstract

The quantum algebra suq(2) is introduced as a deformation of the
ordinary Lie algebra su(2). This is achieved in a simple way by making use
of q-bosons. In connection with the quantum algebra suq(2), we discuss
the q-analogues of the harmonic oscillator and the angular momentum.
We also introduce q-analogues of the hydrogen atom by means of a q-
deformation of the Pauli equations and of the so-called Kustaanheimo-
Stiefel transformation.

1. Introduction

A new algebraic structure, the structure of quantum group, has been
developed since 1985 [1-3] and is still the subject of developments both in
mathematics and theoretical physics. Such a structure, which is related to
the structure of Hopf bi-algebra, takes its origin in various ﬁelds of the-
oretical physics (e.g., statistical mechanics, integrable systems, conformal
ﬁeld theory).

The notion of quantum group is more easily approached through the
one of quantum algebra. Loosely speaking, the latter notion corresponds
to a deformation, depending on a certain parameter q, of a Lie algebra.
Most of the applications of quantum algebras, of potential use for chemical
physics, have been mainly devoted to the harmonic oscillator [4-8] and to
coherent states [9,10].

It is the aim of this paper to brieﬂy describe one of the simplest quan-
tum groups, viz., the quantum group SUq(2), or rather its quantum algebra
suq(2), and to underline its potential use in chemical physics. For this pur-
pose, we examine in turn three dynamical systems connected with quan-
tum groups : the q-deformed harmonic oscillator, the q-deformed angular
momentum and the q-deformed hydrogen atom. These new systems, also
referred to as q-analogues, reduce to the corresponding ordinary sytems in
the limiting case q = 1.

The paper presents a review character as far as the q-analogues of the
harmonic oscillator (in Section 2) and the angular momenta (in Section 3)
are concerned. The discussion (in Section 3 and Appendix 2) about the
relevance of the quantum algebra soq(3, 2) for studying the q-analogues
of spherical and hyperbolic angular momenta is new. The introduction
(in Section 4) of q-analogues for the hydrogen atom is developed for the
ﬁrst time. No sophisticated mathematical pre-requisite is necessary to
understand this self-contained article.

which is very familiar to the chemist.

for a given q in the ﬁeld of complex numbers C.

It is to be observed that in the limiting case q = 1, we have simply
[c] = c so that a+, a and N are (respectively) in this case the ordinary
creation, annihilation and number operators encountered in various areas
of theoretical chemistry and physics. In the case where q
= 1, with q not
being a root of unity, the operators a+, a and N deﬁned by equations
(2-3) are called q-deformed creation, annihilation and number operators,
respectively. (In this case, the complex number [c] deﬁned by (3) is a q-
deformed number; some algebraic relations satisﬁed by such q-deformed
numbers are listed in Appendix 1.)

Property 1. As a trivial property, we have

The set

satisfying (4-6) is a set of q-bosons as originally deﬁned
by Macfarlane [4] and Biedenharn [5] (see also Refs. [6,7]). From equation
(5), it is clear that the operators a and a+ reduce to ordinary bosons in
the limiting case q = 1.

}

We are now in a position to introduce a q-deformed harmonic oscilla-
tor. The literature on this subject is now abundant and the reader may
consult, for example, Refs. [4-10] for further details.

Equation (7) deﬁnes q-deformed momentum and position operators px
and x, respectively, and bears the same form as for the ordinary creation
and annihilation operators corresponding to the limiting case q = 1.

Property 3. The commutator of the q-deformed operators x and px is

[x, px] = i¯h ([N + 1]

[N ])

−

(8)

which reduces to the ordinary value i¯h in the limiting case q = 1.

In terms of eigenvalues, equation (8) can be rewritten as

[x, px] = i¯h

cosh[(n + 1

2 ln q)

2 ) ln q]

(10)

when q
= 1. Thus, we may think of a q-deformed uncertainty principle: the
right-hand side of (9) increases with n (i.e., with the energy, see equation
(11) below) and is minimum as well as n-independent in the limiting case
q = 1 [5].

Deﬁnition 3. We deﬁne the self-adjoint operator H on

in terms of the q-deformed operators previously deﬁned.

In the limiting case q = 1, the operator H is nothing but the Hamil-
tonian for a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator. Following Macfarlane [4]
and Biedenharn [5], we take equation (10) as the deﬁning relation for a
q-deformed one-dimensional harmonic oscillator. The case of a q-deformed
d-dimensional, with d
2, (isotropic or anisotropic) harmonic oscillator
can be handled from a superposition of one-dimensional q-deformed oscil-
lators.

This spectrum turns out to be a deformation of the one for the or-

(20)

The operators J− and J+ are clearly shift operators for the quantum
number m. The operators J−, J3 = (J3)† and J+ = (J−)† reduce to
ordinary spherical angular momentum operators in the limiting case q = 1.
The latter assertion is evident from (20) or even directly from (19).

At this stage, the quantum algebra suq(2) can be introduced, in a
pedestrian way, from equations (19) and (20) as a deformation of the or-
dinary Lie algebra of the special unitary group SU (2). In this regard, we
have the following property.

Property 6. The commutators of the q-deformed spherical angular

momentum operators J−, J3 and J+ are

[J3, J−] =

J−

[J3, J+] = + J+

[J+, J−] = [2J3]

(21)

−

which reduce to the familiar expressions known in angular momentum
theory in the limiting case q = 1.

Equation (21) is at the root of the deﬁnition of the quantum algebra
suq(2). Roughly speaking, this algebra is spanned by any set J−, J3, J+ of
three operators satisfying (21) where we recognize familiar commutators
except for the third one. The notion of invariant operator also exists for
quantum algebras. In this connection, we can verify that the operator

J 2 =

(J+J− + J−J+) +

2

[2]
2

[J3]2

(22)

is a Casimir operator in the sense that it commutes with each of the gener-
ators J−, J3 and J+ of the quantum algebra suq(2). It can be proved that
the eigenvalues of the hermitian operator J 2 are [j] [j + 1] with 2j
N, a
result compatible with the well-known one corresponding to the limiting
case q = 1.

Deﬁnition 6. We now introduce the operators

K− = a+a−

K3 =

The operators K− and K+ behave like shift operators for the quantum
number j. The operators K−, K3 = (K3)† and K+ = (K−)† reduce
to ordinary hyperbolic angular momentum operators in the limiting case
q = 1 [11,12]. From equation (24), we expect that they generate the
quantum algebra suq(1, 1), a result which is trivial when q = 1.

Property 8. The commutators of the q-deformed hyperbolic angular

momentum operators K−, K3 and K+ are

[K3, K−] =

[K3, K+] = + K+

[K+, K−] =

(25)

which characterizes the quantum algebra suq(1, 1).

Equations (20) and (21), on one hand, and equations (24) and (25), on
the other, can serve to develop the theory of q-deformed spherical and hy-
perbolic angular momenta. This theory involves the q-deformation of cou-
pling (Clebsch-Gordan) coeﬃcients and recoupling (Racah and Wigner)
coeﬃcients, projection operators, etc. and shall not be described here (see,
among numerous papers, Ref. [13]). In the limiting case q = 1, the Wigner-
Racah algebra of SU (2), in an SU (2)
U (1) basis, plays a considerable
rˆole in this theory ; in this case, the Lie algebra of the de Sitter group
SO(3, 2) is the natural framework for studying the Wigner-Racah alge-
bra of SU (2). We devote the rest of this section to some basic elements
indicating the relevance of the quantum algebra soq(3, 2) when q

= 1.

4. q-Analogue of the Hydrogen Atom

We now consider an (ordinary) hydrogenlike atom in 3 dimensions
with reduced mass µ and nuclear charge Ze. We deal here only with the
discrete spectrum of this (Coulomb) dynamical system, i.e., with negative
energies E.

According to Pauli [14], the Coulomb system can be described in an

operator form by the equations (see also Ref. [15])

The transition from the ordinary hydrogen atom to a q-deformed hy-
drogen atom can be achieved by passing from the (direct sum) Lie algebra
bsuq(2). The
asu(2)
application of this deformation to equation (28) leads to the q-analogue of
the hydrogen(like) atom whose energy spectrum is given by

so(4) to the quantum algebra asuq(2)

(31)

The q-deformed atom thus deﬁned has the same ground state energy
as the ordinary atom. The other states are shifted when passing from
= 1. The whole (discrete) spectrum of the q-deformed hydrogen
q = 1 to q
atom exhibits the same degeneracy as the ordinary one. Of course, the
q-deformed spectrum coincides with the ordinary one when q goes to 1.

To close this section, we should mention there are other ways to deﬁne
a q-analogue of the hydrogen atom which do not lead to the spectrum (30-
31). In this respect, by using the Kustaanheimo-Stiefel transformation (see
Ref. [15]), we are left with a q-deformed hydrogen atom characterized by
the discrete spectrum

Equation (32) can be derived (i) by transforming the three-dimensional
hydrogen atom into a four-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator by
means of the Kustaanheimo-Stiefel transformation [15], (ii) by passing from
the latter oscillator to its q-analogue and (iii) by invoking the “inverse”

Kustaanheimo-Stiefel transformation. The result (32) thus obtained con-
stitutes an alternative to (30).

5. Closing Remarks

We have concentrated in the present paper on q-deformations of three
dynamical systems (harmonic oscillator, angular momentum and hydro-
gen atom) largely used in physical chemistry. The q-deformed dynamical
systems have been introduced in connection with the quantum algebra
suq(2) which turns out to be a deformation of su(2) characterized by the
deformation parameter q.

We have seen that the parameter q enters the (energy) spectra for the
q-analogues of the considered dynamical systems. There is no universal
signiﬁcance of the parameter q. However, in view of the fact that the lim-
iting case q = 1 gives back the usual spectra, the deformation parameter
q might be considered as a ﬁne structure parameter (like a curvature con-
stant), to be obtained from a ﬁtting procedure, for describing small eﬀects.
In addition, it may happen in some situations that it is worth to consider
q as a completely free parameter with values far from 1 leading to new
models [16].

We have experienced that the correspondence between the hydrogen
atom and its q-analogue is not one-to-one. (This is indeed a general prob-
lem we face when dealing with q-analogues.) As a remedy, the use of
the q-derivative leading to a q-deformed Schr¨odinger equation might be
interesting. Also, the use of sets of noncommuting q-bosons might be ap-
propriate to ensure suq(2) covariance.

From the commutation relations in this appendix and in Section 3, we
recover that the set
spans the (10-dimensional) noncompact Lie
algebra so(3, 2)

sp(4, R) in the limiting case q = 1 [12].

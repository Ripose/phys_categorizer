Modern molecular theories of equilibrium thermodynamics and nonequilibrium thermody-

namics are based almost entirely on the Liouville equation which describes the conservation of an

ensemble of phase points as they move through phase space according to a speciﬁed Hamiltonian1.

Unfortunately, the Liouville equation is based on a ﬁxed number of particles and cannot describe

systems where the total number of particles varies. For example, the Liouville equation can-

not describe the statistical mechanical, grand canonical ensemble used in the development of

thermodynamic properties of open, equilibrium systems. In this letter, we extend the Liouville

equation to systems where the number of particles varies. To our knowledge this has not been

done before and has restricted the theoretical development of nonequilibrium thermodynamics.

These systems include open systems, where the particle number can vary because of open bound-

aries, or closed or open systems where particles can be annihilated or created either classically

by chemical reactions or due to quantum mechanical eﬀects.

II. The Extended Liouville Equation

The Liouville equation describes the behavior of a collection or ensemble of phase points as

they move through a multidimensional space, or phase-space. Each phase point represents the

position (or generalized coordinates qi) and momentum (or conjugate momentum pi) of all N

molecules or particles in the system. The phase points tend to be concentrated in regions of phase

space where it is most likely to ﬁnd the N particles with a certain momentum and position. Thus,

the Liouville density function, ρL, can be interpreted (aside from a normalization constant) as a

probability density function, i.e., ρLdqN dpN is proportional to the probability of ﬁnding a phase

point in a multidimensional region between (qN , pN ) and (qN + dqN , pN + dpN ) at any time, t.

1

Here and throughout we use the short-hand notation qN = q1, · · · , q3N and pN = p1, · · · , p3N . It

can be readily shown that the Liouville density function obeys the conservation equation1

where H(pN , qN , t) is the Hamiltonian or total energy of the N-particle system.

It is to be noted that the Liouville equation describes the phase space behavior of the density

function ρL(pN , qN , t) under the conditions where the number of particles N is a constant. To

extend the Liouville equation to a system where the number of particles or dimensionality can

vary, consider the extended space (pN , qN , N, t) shown in Fig.1. The total members of the

ensemble in extended space is a constant denoted by M, and the density of phase points is

denoted by ρN (pN , qN , N, t). Thus, we have that

ρN (pN , qN , N, t)dpN dqN = M

(2)

XN Z Z

As shown in Fig.1, the extended space can be divided into “canonical” hyperplanes with the

number of phase points at time t in each hyperplane denoted by MN1, MN2, etc., where

M =

MNi

XNi

(3)

The phase points in each hyperplane have the same number of particles or dimensionality

and, hence, we call these “canonical” hyperplanes. As the system evolves in time, the phase

points can move within the plane, if the dimensionality (N) does not change, or “jump” between

2

planes, if the dimensionality (N) of the phase point changes. In any event, the total number of

phase points M remains constant with time.

Now, it is not possible to straightforwardly extend the Liouville equation by considering

diﬀerential changes in qN , pN and N (the extended space), since as N changes so does the

dimensionality of the phase space coordinates (qN , pN ). However, if we deﬁne a new function

¯ρ(N, t) =

ρN (pN , qN , N, t)dpN dqN = MN

(4)

Z Z

then, in order to conserve the total number of phase points M, it can be readily shown (Appendix

A) that ¯ρ must obey the one-dimensional conservation equation

∂ ¯ρ

∂

[¯ρv(N, t)] = 0

where we have introduced a “velocity” function, v(N, t),

v(N, t) ≡ v+(N, t) − v−(N, t)

(5)

(6)

which physically represents the net fractional number of phase points leaving the N th hyperplane

per unit time (Appendix A); v+ represents the fraction of phase points leaving the N th hyperplane

to the (N + 1)th hyperplane, and v− are the fraction per unit time leaving to the (N − 1)th

hyperplane. Now, within each hyperplane we introduce the Liouville density ρL(pN , qN , t; N),

deﬁned as a conditional density function

The phase points that move within the hyperplane over a diﬀerential time, dt, obey the usual,

Liouville equation, Eq.(1),

Thus, the space-time behavior of the extended Liouville density function ρN (pN , qN , N, t) is

uniquely determined through Eqs.(5), (7) and (8). Physically, we can envision that phase points

move in each hyperplane over a diﬀerential time, dt, according to Eq.(8). At the end of the

diﬀerential time, some phase points “jump” into new canonical hyperplanes according to Eq.(5).

Thus, the number of phase points in each canonical hyperplane with a ﬁxed dimensionality

continually change with time. Although both the dimensionality change and time change are

discrete, the continuous representation given by Eq.(5) should approximately hold for N large

and dt → 0.

Liouville equation as

Multiplying Eq.(5) by ρL, Eq.(8) by ¯ρ, and combining using Eq.(7) we can write an extended

In the next section, we derive a general conservation (transport) equation for an arbitrary

dynamic variable where the total number of particles can vary. From this we obtain a particle

number conservation equation which includes a general term accounting for the annihilation or

creation of particles.

Extending Irving and Kirkwood’s formalism2, the “conservation equations” for variable par-

ticle number systems can be obtained by ﬁrst considering an arbitrary quantity α(rN , pN , N)

that does not depend explicitly on time. The average or expectation value of α is deﬁned as

Again, extending Irving and Kirkwood’s formalism2 for variable particle number systems,

the equation for particle number conservation (ordinary number density) can be obtained from

Eq.(16) by setting

The third term on the left-hand side accounts for the creation or annihilation of particles in the

system as considered in more detail in the example below.

Example. First-Order Particle Annihilation

As a simple example of the application of Eq.(26) consider the problem of particle annihilation

where the fractional number of particles leaving the N th hyperplane to the (N − 1)th hyperplane

is a constant k. Thus, Eq.(5) becomes

(27)

or, in “ﬁnite N” form (Appendix A)

∂ ¯ρ(N, t)
∂t

− k[¯ρ(N + 1, t) − ¯ρ(N, t)] = 0

(28)

Consider that initially all phase points are in the N0 hyperplane, i.e.,

¯ρ(N0, 0) = 1

(29)

and

¯ρ(N, 0) = 0

, N ∈ [0, N0 − 1]

(30)

Around the N0 hyperplane, the population balance equation is

∂ ¯ρ(N0, t)
∂t

+ k ¯ρ(N0, t) = 0

Thus, using the initial state Eq.(29), we obtain

(31)

(32)

Now, performing a balance around the N0 − 1 hyperplane using Eq.(32) leads to

¯ρ(N0, t) = e−kt

∂ ¯ρ(N0 − 1, t)
∂t

+ k ¯ρ(N0 − 1, t) = ke−kt

and, using the initial condition Eq.(30), we obtain

around the N = 0 hyperplane (total particle annihilation plane) in order to satisfy the normal-

Note that for small times compared to (N0 − N)/k the decay kinetics are not ﬁrst-order, even

for a constant rate of phase point hopping, k. This example helps illustrate the generality of the

extended Liouville equation. Next, we address the question as to whether the extended Liouville

equation leads to an equilibrium behavior consistent with the grand canonical ensemble.

IV. Equilibrium Behavior. Grand Canonical Ensemble

Under equilibrium conditions, ∂ ¯ρ/∂t = 0, the general stationary solution to Eq.(5) can be

written as

¯ρ(N, t) = C1f (N)

v(N, t) = C2[f (N)]−1

12

(40)

(41)

where C1 and C2 are constants to be determined and f (N) is an arbitrary function of N. Now,

it is already well-known that a particular stationary solution to Eq.(8), under the conditions

∂ρL/∂t = 0, can be written in dimensionally correct form as3

ρL(pN , qN ; N) =

exp

−βH(pN , qN )

where h is Planck’s constant that has the units of action (length × momentum), H(pN , qN ) is

the Hamiltonian or total energy, and C3 and β are constants to be determined.

The constant β can be determined by requiring that the average kinetic energy on each

hyperplane be a uniform constant (canonical ensemble on the hyperplane), i.e., in Cartesian

coordinates

Finally, normalizing ρN with the total number of phase points M leads to the well-known form

for the equilibrium grand canonical ensemble. All that we can state from the extended Liouville

equation is that Eq.(51) is a particular stationary solution to Eq.(5)4. We are presented with the

same diﬃculty as in the equilibrium solution to the ordinary Liouville equation, Eq.(29), i.e., the

lack of proof of the uniqueness of Eq.(29) under equilibrium conditions - a well-known problem

in statistical mechanics.

Finally, we note that to complete the grand canonical ensemble description, we must still

specify λ. This procedure is already well-known and is generally accomplished by comparison to

the thermodynamic relation6.

The results and procedures given in Eqs.(52) - (57) are already well established, and we

present them only for completeness.

IV. Conclusions

The importance of the analysis given here lies in the evolution equations, Eqs.(5) - (8), or

Eqs.(9) or (10), that describe, in general, the nonequilibrium behavior of the extended Liouville

density ρN (pN , qN , N, t) for systems where the number of particles is not ﬁxed. A general con-

servation equation can be derived, following Irving and Kirkwood’s paradigm2, for systems where

the total number of particles can vary. As an example, the general particle number conservation

equation was obtained that was shown to include a general term for particle annihilation or

creation. It was also demonstrated that the grand canonical ensemble distribution is a partic-

ular stationary solution to the extended Liouville equation. As with the equilibrium solution

to the ordinary Liouville equation, uniqueness of the variable particle number solution under

equilibrium conditions remains to be demonstrated. It is to be noted that the general station-

ary solution to the extended Liouville equation, Eqs.(40) and (41), demonstrates that v(N) is

smallest where ¯ρ is largest, i.e., near the most probable state. Conversely, phase points move

16

or change their dimensionality more rapidly from regions where ¯ρ is small, i.e., near the least

probable state. Further treatment of the extended Liouville equation in nonequilibrium systems

is under current investigation.

Appendix A. Conservation Equation for ¯ρ(N, t)

Consider a simple population balance around the N th hyperplane (see Fig.1). Since phase

points cannot be created or destroyed, we must have

where v+(N, t) represents the fraction of phase points in the N th hyperplane leaving to the (N +

1)th plane per unit time, v−(N, t) represents the fraction of phase points in the N th hyperplane

leaving to the (N − 1)th plane per unit time, etc. Now, using a ﬁnite diﬀerence representation of

Abstract

We develop a Feynman rule for energy-level diagrams emphasizing their connections to the

double-sided Feynman diagrams and physical processes in the Liouville space. Thereby we com-

pletely identify such diagrams and processes contributing to the two-dimensional response function

in the Brownian oscillator model. We classify such diagrams or processes in quartet and numeri-

cally present signals separately from each quartet of diagrams or Liouville-space processes. We ﬁnd

that the signal from each quartet is distinctly diﬀerent from the others; we can identify each peaks

in frequency domain with a certain quartet. This oﬀers the basis for analyzing and assigning actual

two-dimensional peaks and suggests the possibility of Liouville-space-path selective spectroscopy.

As an application we demonstrate an example in which two familiar homogeneous mechanisms of

relaxation are distinguished by existence or non-existence of certain peaks on the two-dimensional

map; appearance or disappearance of certain peak is sensitive to the coupling mechanism. We also

point out some confusion in the literature with regard to inclusion of relaxation eﬀects.

INTRODUCTION

The use of ultrashort laser pulse to probe the properties of molecules has been propelled

by the rapid advances in laser measurement techniques.[1] Recently, two-dimensional (2D)

vibrational spectroscopy has been actively studied, where the spectral properties of multi-

body correlation functions of polarizability (2D Raman spectroscopy) [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,

11, 12, 13, 14] or dipole moment (2D infrared spectroscopy) [15, 16, 17, 18] are measured.

The 2D technique provides information about the inter- and intra-molecular interactions

which cause energy relaxations. [19, 20, 21, 22, 23]

Theoretically, optical responses of molecular vibrational motions have been studied

mainly by either an oscillator model [24] or energy level model.

[25] The oscillator model

utilizes molecular coordinates to describe molecular motions. This description is physically

intuitive since optical observables (dipole moments or Raman polarizability) are also de-

scribed by molecular coordinates; the eﬀects of relaxation, which are caused by interactions

of the coordinate with some other degrees of freedom, are rather easy to be included. As

long as the potential is harmonic or nearly harmonic, signals can be calculated analytically.

[2, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31]

On the contrary, the energy-level model employs the energy eigen functions of a molecular

motion but is physically equivalent to the oscillator model. Accordingly, laser interactions are

described by transitions between the energy levels; the optical processes, including the time-

ordering of laser pulses, are conveniently described by diagrams such as Albrecht diagrams,

[32] or double-sided Feynman diagrams. [1] Although the inclusion of relaxation processes

from physical insight is less intuitive and is restricted to some special cases, this model has the

advantage in identifying peak positions of optical signal in frequency domain. [33, 34, 35, 36]

The anharmonicity of potential and nonlinear mode-mode coupling are also easily taken into

account. Phase matching conditions, which chose a speciﬁc Liouville path contribution by

the conﬁguration of Laser beams, [1] is also easy to take into account.

In the oscillator

model or molecular dynamical simulations, the phase matching condition can be done only

after calculating entire response functions. [37]

The rate of increase in the number of diagrams, however, with the increase of laser

interactions is severer in the energy-level model; this becomes serous practical problem for

multi-dimensional spectroscopy, where many laser interactions are included. For example,

3

more than 16 diagrams are involved in the lowest order in the third-order anhamonicity

in ﬁfth-order Raman while all the diagrams can be represented by a single ﬁeld-theoretic

diagram in the oscillator model. [27]

In this paper we try to bridge the two complementary models by transferring some results

obtained in the oscillator-model to the energy-level language. Although we lose the simplic-

ity (e.g. small number of diagrams) we gain in an insight into optical processes; we can

assign each peaks in certain optical or Liouville-space processes. The resulting energy-level

Feynman rule for the oscillator system allows inclusion of relaxation mechanism in an ad

hoc way. As an application, we compare two system with diﬀerent damping constants. This

example reveals that existence of certain peaks in 2D spectroscopic map sensitively depends

on the relaxation model.

of processes in Eq. (5) are represented by the energy-level (Albrecht-like) diagrams in Fig.

section. Before explaining diagrams, let us review possible transitions by operators Q and

Q2; Q can cause a one-quantum excitation or de-excitation while Q2 can result in a two-

quantum excitation or de-excitation in addition to a zero-quantum transition. For example,

In this paper, we simplify the original Albrecht diagrams [32] for comparison with the

Liouville paths. The main diﬀerences are the following: (1) we use always the same horizontal

lines regardless of ket or bra states; it is not the case in the original Albrecht diagrams and

ing to Fig. 1-(iv) is described in Fig. 2; each quantum transition is represented not by a

pair of arrow but an arrow. Note Raman and IR processes can be equivalent theoretically

at this level of description, although even orders of IR processes, such as second-order IR

signal vanish except in anisotopic media, such as adsorbed molecules on metallic surface.

[41] This situation can be overcome by mixing the IR and Raman processes. [38] By using

narrow-band lasers (two IR excitation pulses followed one probe pulse which create Raman

signal) Zhao and Wright demonstrated such experiment. [23, 40]

III. ENERGY-LEVEL DIAGRAM AND DOUBLE-SIDED DIAGRAM

We can represent processes in the Liouville-space in a diﬀerent way by the double-sided

Feynman diagrams. The diagrams in Fig. 4 are the translation of the diagrams in Fig. 1, 2,

or 3. In the double-sided diagrams, time runs from the left to the right (as in the energy-level

diagram). The horizontal lines, however, are always two in number, the upper and lower

line. The former represents the ket state while the latter the bra state. The single circle

stands for a one-quantum transition, while the double circle for a two quantum transition.

The quantum number of the bra and ket states is denoted explicitly in the diagram.

It is noted that there are some diﬀerences of diagrammatic notation among articles. For

example, in some literature, the quantum transition is not represented by circles but arrows.

In other one, diagrams are rotated by 90 degree so that the time runs from the bottom to

In general, as seen below (VI. A), the double-sided diagram is convenient for enumeration

of all possible diagrams while the energy-level diagram is for understanding the physical

except for what xk implies. Accordingly, we can develop a universal rule to write down

analytical expressions from diagrams via the interpretations (such as Eqs. (7)-(10)) in the

Liouville-space; the derivation is a straightforward exercise in elementary quantum mechan-

10

ics and would be discussed elsewhere.

It can be summarized in the following way. We

associate with each interaction (originating from the interaction Qk/k!) at a certain time or

each propagation for a certain period one of the following factors:

By multiplying all the factors and putting another factor 1/2 to avoid double-counting

(see Theorem 2 below), we obtain an analytical expression of the corresponding diagram

(Feynman rule). Here, we have introduced ζmn and Γmn (

0) to describe relaxation; the

diﬀerence of frequency modiﬁed due to the relaxation is deﬁned by ζmn = (m

By deﬁnition, the propagation period implies the time between two interactions. This

excludes the periods from tI to t1 and from t3 to tF in diagrams in Figs. 1-4 (or, say, in Eq.

(7)-(10)) because there is no interaction at tI or tF ; we associate the unity for these special

period.

Let us apply our rule without relaxation (Γmn = 0, ζmn = Ωmn) to a diagram or a

Liouville-space path. As the ﬁrst example, we consider the diagram (i) (of Fig. 1 or 4).

We have only 2 separate propagation periods by deﬁnition. In the ﬁrst period from t1 to t2

The process in Eq. (8) or the diagram (ii) (of Figs. 1 or 4) is diﬀerent from (i) only after

t3. Although the last interaction at t3 is that for the bra state (expressed by the ﬁne arrows

and diﬀerent form (i)) the factors for this last interaction is the same with that of (i) by the

above Feynman rule; there is no sign diﬀerences between bra and ket states (only) for the

last interaction. In summary we have

(ii) = (i).

In general, we have the following theorem, which is related to the double counting: The

diagrams diﬀerent only by the side of the last interaction (bra or ket side) have the same

contribution (Theorem2).

conjugate diagram is obtained by interchanging all the normal and ﬁne arrows (Theorem 3).

In the double-sided Feynman diagrams, instead, The complex-conjugate diagram is obtained

by interchanging the circles on the upper and lower lines (Theorem 3′).

The diagram (iv) is the complex-conjugate diagram of (ii) because the ﬁne and normal

arrows are interchanged, i.e., (iv) = (ii)∗. We can also verify the relation, (iii) = (iv), from

the above Feynman rule with reconﬁrming Theorem 2.

sult even if assuming that the system is initially in the ground state is by no means trivial

but established by other calculation methods.

[27] This implies, for example, that the de-

pendence on n of the analytical expression corresponding to Fig. 5 cancels out with some

other diagram. When the damping mechanism other than (fully-corrected) Ohmic Brown-

VI. LIOUVILLE-SPACE QUARTET

The four diagrams (i)-(iv) in Figs. 1 and 4 are a special set in the sense that we can

obtain the other three, starting from one of the quartet.

In the energy-level diagram, we obtain the second by changing the last interaction by

using one of the following rule (depending on the last interaction of the starting diagram);

(1) the ket excitation to a bra de-excitation, (2) the ket de-excitation to a bra excitation, (3)

the bra excitation to a ket de-excitation and (4) the bra de-excitation to a ket excitation. The

13

FIG. 5: General process corresponding to Fig. 1 (i)

remaining two diagrams are the complex-conjugate diagrams of the previous two diagrams

where the conjugates are obtained by interchanging the ﬁne and normal arrows.

In the double-sided diagram the second diagram is obtained by lowering or raising the

last circle. The remaining two is by interchanging lower and upper line with circles.

As seen before, the corresponding analytical expressions of (i)-(iv) have the relations,

(i) = (ii), (iii) = (iv), and (i) = (iii)∗. The sum of the quartet is always real:

(i) + (ii) + (iii) + (iv) = 4 Re[(i)] = 4 Re[(n)]

where n = i, ii, iii or iv. Taking the real part of Eq. (11) we have an expression for the

quartet,

This is reﬂected by the factor cos (2ΩT1 + ΩT2) in Eq. (12).

We notice that in the case with damping if Γmn (and ζmn) were not symmetric, VI could

not be real; the symmetric property of Γmn is required for the response function to be real.

FIG. 6: All possible quartets for R(2)(T1, T2). The square bracket implies that four diagrams

are collectively represented. For example, the ﬁrst diagram in the energy-level diagram for R(1)

corresponds to not only (i) of Fig. 1 (which is explicitly written in the bracket) but other three

diagrams (ii)-(iv) of Fig. 1.

A. Quartets representation: all possible quartets for R(2)(T1, T2)

We show six quartets R(1)

R(6) in Fig. 6 in the double-sided representation. The square

−

brackets imply the quartet; only one of the quartet is explicitly written in the bracket. For

example, R(1) of Fig. 6 collectively stands for (i)-(iv) of Fig. 4.

In Fig. 6, on the right side, ten quartets in the energy-level representation are given;

some quartets in double-sided representation corresponds to not one but two quartets in the

energy-level representation. For example, R(1) contains contribution I and I′, while R(3)

contains only A2.

15

These six quartets R(1)

R(6) in Fig. 6 exhaust all possible contribution to the right-

hand side of Eq. (5); there are 3 ways for the position of the double quantum transition

(double circle) and there 23 ways to put the three (including one double circle) circles upper

or lower line, which leads to 3

23 double-sided Feynman diagrams in total. These 3

8

diagrams can be divided into 6 quartets that have been shown. We understand here that

−

·

the double-sided diagram is convenient for enumerating all possible diagrams.

VII. DAMPING MECHANISM

We can conﬁrm that the well-known result for the Ohmic Brownian oscillator (BO) model

(Ohmic implies that the system-bath coupling is in the bilinear form) is reproduced from

Eq. (15) by setting

Γnm =



m
|
|

be zero, which is true if Γ21 = Γ10, while D1+D2 should be

D1, which is true if Γ11 = Γ00;

2
−

·

Γmn in Eq. (16) satisﬁes these requirements.

The cancellation of I and II is one of the feature of the Brownian result. Another feature

is that the state

0

0

decays with the relaxation constant γ/2 which is the same as that

|

i h

|

for

1

1

. These characteristics have intrigued some controversy as mentioned below.
|

|
The relaxation constant for the same Ohmic model within the lower level approximation,

i h

i.e., at the level of the Fermi’s golden rule with a somewhat ad hoc approximation (see

below), given by [33, 44]

Γmn =

n + m
2

γ,

which is also simple but incompatible with the above two requirements (Γ21 = Γ10 and

Γ11 = Γ00). With this relaxation constant, I and II survives, for example. (In addition,
there is no frequency shift (ζmn →

Ωmn) in this ﬁnite-order approximation).

n
The frequency shift and appearance of the absolute value (
|

m
|

−

), which is non-analytic,

in the oﬀ diagonal relaxation constant in the fully corrected expressions originate from the

summation of inﬁnite number of diagrams; in the well-known result of Ohmic BO model

the bilinear coupling between the system-bath is fully taken into account; this is the exact

prediction from a simple reasonable model and we concern with the relaxation of fully-

dressed states in the exact result of BO model. On the contrary, the relaxation constant in

Eq. (17), is the result of the same model but with the second-order (in the coupling strength)

approximation. Nonetheless in some context the second-order result has been favored while

the full-order result has been questioned. [33, 45]

As we show below we can distinguish the above two models ((16) or (17)) by some two-

dimensional experiment by checking existence or absence of certain peaks. In other words,

18

6
whether the coherence (oﬀ-diagonal) relaxation constant which depends only on the quantum

number diﬀerence (where Γm+n,m = Γn,0) and the level independent population relaxation

is appropriate (as the ﬁrst-order picture) or not might be checked experimentally.

Note that if the system has some sort of anharmonicity such as the anharmonicity of po-

tential [24] or the nonlinear system-bath coupling [46], the relaxation constants do not hold

the relation Γ21 = Γ10 etc., even we take into account higher-order system bath interactions.

Then the number of Liouville paths involved in the optical processes increase dramatically

especially when the system-bath interaction is very strong. Also if the laser-molecular in-

teraction is much shorter than the time duration of the system-bath interactions, one has

to regard the relaxation rate as a function of time, i.e. Γnm(t). In such case, the equation

of motion approach is more appropriate than the diagrammatic approaches, although it

requires computationally expensive calculations. [47, 48, 49, 50] [46] [51]

We comment on confusion in the literature with regard to the Redﬁeld theory, one ex-

ample of which is Eq. (17). The Redﬁeld theory without the rotational wave approximation

(RWA) is equivalent to the Fokker-Planck equation. [46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51] The time evo-

lution operator in the Liouville space from the state

is then expressed as

, which can not be justiﬁed from the coordinate representation

model. [33, 44] Accordingly, this ad hoc methodology possesses a ﬂaw in the sense that the

theory thus obtained does not converges to analytical perturbative results such as obtained
by the Brownian oscillator model. It is possible to evaluate eﬀective tensor element Γ(eﬀ)

ijkl by
solving the equation of motion such as the Fokker-Planck equation with linear and nonlinear

system-bath interactions, [46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51] but the calculated results are quite diﬀerent

from the Redﬁeld tensor elements. [46]

2D SIGNAL FROM EACH LIOUVILLE-SPACE QUARTET

In this section, we present two-dimensional signals from each Liouville-space quartet

separately in the fully corrected Brownian oscillator model. In the frequency domain, since

the signal is a complex number, we show the absolute value of the signal.

In the time

domain, the signal is real, which is directly shown.

24

upper four plots correspond to the separate contribution from each Liouville-space quartets. The

bottom plot is the sum of them, i.e., the total signal.

A. Frequency Domain

Fig. 9 shows signals from the system with a single mode (Ω = 1, γ = 0.1, in arbitrary

unit). Signals from each Liouville space quartet are separately shown. We can interpret

each peak in the following way: the process represented by

each peak with distinct Liouville-space paths by the following table.

the possibility of Liouville-space-path selective spectroscopy.

XI. SIGNALS FROM BROWNIAN OSCILLATOR MODEL AND REDFIELD-

TYPE MODEL

In Fig. 12, we compare results from two models: (1) Brownian oscillator (BO) model (the

system-bath interaction is fully taken into account) where we put Eq. (16). (2) Redﬁeld-type
model (RT) where we put Eq. (17) with the replacement ζs →

Ωs (no frequency shift).

Top: the right plot from RT model has extra peaks at on the left (BO) at (ω1, ω2) =

(2, 1). They originate from the survival of the quartets I and II in Fig. 6.

±

Middle: on the left plot (BO) there exist extra peaks at (ω1, ω2) =

(1,

1). This

±

−

corresponds to the single-mode quartet B in Fig. 6. For this process, the relaxation constants

associated with the ω2-axis, Γ12, in BO and RT are given by γ and 3γ, respectively; the

relaxation in RT is much faster, which explains the disappearance of the peaks. The peaks

at (ω1, ω2) =

(0.5,

0.5) still survives because these peaks not only come from the single-

mode process B: in this case, the peaks from quartet I and II overlap with those from other

quartets.

Bottom: on the right plot (RT) exists extra peaks at (ω1, ω2) =

(0.3, 0.6). They corre-

±

sponds to the survival of I and II in Fig. 6.

In summary, the detailed situation depends on parameters. However, they have one thing

in common; the diﬀerence between the models manifests as existence or absence of certain

peaks. In the numerical results given above are all in the weak damping regime (γ

0.1Ω).

∼

The weak eﬀect, nonetheless, aﬀects the existence and absence of certain peaks. This is

because the damping constants directly matter in the cancellation mechanism of certain

processes. Note that the situation is completely diﬀerent for weak potential anharmonicity

32

or nonlinear polarizability. Such weak eﬀects, on the contrary, do not concern delicate

cancellation mechanisms.

If the system exhibits non-weak anharmonicity of potential or the nonlinear system-bath

coupling, as mentioned before, there may be the peaks at the similar position predicted by

the Redﬁeld-type model. Such mechanism, however, aﬀect not only the existence of these

peak but also the entire proﬁle of signal, which involves diﬀerent Liouville paths. The careful

study of the signal in frequency domain shall be the critical test of the Redﬁeld-type model.

XII. CONCLUDING REMARKS

We stated an interpretation of the energy-level diagrams in the Liouville space and sum-

marize the relationships between several diagrammatic representations. We emphasized all

the diagrammatic representation reduces to unique interpretations in Liouville space, via

which we can write down analytical expression by a Feynman rule.

We have given examples in which each Liouville process make distinctly unique contri-

bution to two-dimensional signal; the selective detection of quantum process by ultrafast

spectroscopy might be possible, for example, by utilizing the phase matching condition. [37]

By suitably prepared spectroscopic conﬁguration, we might be able to concentrate on a cer-

tain quantum processes, which allows simpler analysis and more quantitative understanding.

Such Liouville-space-path selective spectroscopy might be promising. As photon echo can

be distinguished from the pump-probe via phase matching condition, we could diﬀerentiate

spectroscopic methods by the peaks they produce.

Energy-level diagram is useful in interpreting the physical process but it is so only after

conﬁrming the diagram certainly makes a non-zero contribution possibly by other method.

For example, in the (fully-corrected) Brownian oscillator model, we can assume the ini-

tial state of the diagram is the ground state; this is because we know that other initial

states result in the same contribution from a separate calculation. Another example is the

cancellation of I by II of Fig. 6.

In this respect, diagram in the ﬁeld-theoretical context, for example, introduced in [27] has

some advantage. Number of the diagram to be consider is considerably smaller and analytical

expression is much simply obtained; in the case of R(2)(T1, T2), we have only to consider just

two diagrams in total each being given by the product of two certain propagators. This

33

is because the cancellation is always automatically taken into account in this method and,

in addition, quartets are summed up from the beginning in a simpler form. However, this

conceals physical processes in the Liouville space.

Note here that we have to carefully check out all possible cancellations even if we incor-

porate the phase matching conditions into the response function, as have been utilized in

the electronically resonant experiments such as photon echo and pump-probe to detect the

diﬀerent contributions of the Liouville paths by choosing the laser wavevectors and frequen-

cies. [1] This is because in vibrational spectroscopy such as IR echo, the time durations of

laser pulses are much shorter than the time periods of molecular vibrations. [37] In addition,

if the initial temperature of the system is higher than the excitation energy of vibrational

levels (as in the case of low frequency modes), or if the nonlinearity of the dipole or Ra-

man transitions are important, [9, 10, 27] we have to include a number of Liouville paths

especially in higher order spectroscopy; the assignment of the peaks to some Liouville paths

become nontrivial.

As for the mechanism of relaxation, we have only considered the system bilinearly coupled

with bath. We constructed the Feynman rule by starting from the rule in the case without

damping and then by replacing the propagator so that it causes damping with an appropriate

choice of the relaxation parameters Γmn. One may think that the set

is an arbitrary

Γmn}

{

set of parameters to ﬁt experimental data; in the case of vibrational spectroscopy, however,

Γmn’s have to satisfy certain universal relationships, for example, to satisfy the detailed

balance condition. In addition, the validity of the rotating wave approximation (RWA) and

the Markovian approximation associated with the second order perturbation of the system-

bath interaction might become questionable in vibrational spectroscopy; the characterization

of the relaxation processes by simple rate constants such as T1 and T2 might not work. Note

here that, although there are some restrictions, one can calculate the signals without using

such approximations for Brownian model even in the anharmonic case.

[26, 27, 31, 48] In

order to verify the consistency of theory, it is important to compare the results from energy

level models and the Brownian motion model where the latter is based upon a microscopic

picture.

In order to demonstrate how approximations for relaxation processes can change the

results, we presented the 2D signals from the Redﬁeld-type model and (full-order) Brownian

Oscillator model, and we observed that two models give peaks at diﬀerent positions even

34

for weak damping. This, in turn, suggests high sensitivity to the damping mechanism of

2D spectroscopy. This situation is in good contrast with cross peaks associated with mode-

coupling of anharmonic or nonlinear origin. They might be fairly strong to be observable

with stronger diagonal peaks. On the contrary, the cancellation mechanism is subtle and,

thus, weak damping eﬀect can cause a drastic diﬀerence.

One of the purposes of our paper is to bridge the two complementary approaches of the

coorinate-based and the energy-level based models. The results allow us a useful interpreta-

tion of the coordinate-based model in the energy-level language. We should note, however,

that this interpretation becomes precise only in the weak damping limit. Nonetheless, we

believe that it is useful to have a common interpretation for the two approaches in certain

situations.

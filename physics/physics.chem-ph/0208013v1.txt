Diﬀerent approaches to describe depletion
regions in ﬁrst order phase transition kinetics

Victor Kurasov

Victor.Kurasov@pobox.spbu.ru

During the ﬁrst order phase transitions the objects of a new phase con-
sume a mother phase which leads to some density gaps near existing embryos
of a new phase. This fact is rather obvious [1], but complete theoretical de-
scription was given only in [2]. Now this fact in widely recognized [3] but still
there are some attempts [4] to reconsider this approach which is now known
as the model of depletion zones [3]. Here we shall analyze [4] and show the
useless of reconsideration proposed in [4].

We don’t consider here the picture of the gobal evolution of a system - in
[4] it is so primitive that can not give any reliable quantitative results but only
some very rough estimates without any justiﬁcations. We needn’t to do it
because this has been already done in [2] with all necessary justiﬁcations. So,
we consider only the proﬁle around the solitary embryo, which was the matter
of interest in [4]. Why it is possible to consider only the solitary embryo?
An answer has been given in [2], in [4] this question remains unsolved. Due
to results of [2] we shall consider namely the solitary embryo.

We assume that the substance exchange regime is a diﬀusion one. Then
there is a gap of a vapor density n near an embryo. Then the density n diﬀers
from a density n(
). This diﬀerence initiates a variation in a nucleation rate
I and causes the eﬀect of depletion zones. So, it is very important ro get for
n(r)
) (r is a distance from a center of an embryo) a correct expression.
This expression is a crucial point in consideration of an eﬀect of depletion
zones in nucleation kinetics. Certainly, it has to be a function of time t.

But even with this solution one can not construct the correct form of the

nucleation rate proﬁle. We shall outline this point.

There are following necessary suppositions to get this exact solution for

concentration proﬁle:

The radius of an embryo is constant in time

The boundary condition at r = R is constant in time.

•

Both assumptions are rather approximate. As a result the above solution
is valid only near the surface of an embryo. It is easy to see from the following
arguments. Let δt be the characteristic time when the relative variation of
intensity of vapor consumption v is already essential

It seems that the small distances are the main ones. Certainly the gap is
greater the smaller the distance is. But the small distances aren’t essential
because the functional form of the nucleation rate [2] can be approximated

Instead of (3) in [2] another approach was used. This approach is based

on the strong inequality

δr

(5)

Why this inequality takes place? When we consider classical nucleation,
i.e. transition of a supersaturated vapor into a liquid phase everything is
clear. We have a strong inequality

1

vv/vl ≫
where vv is a partial volume for one molecule in a vapor, vl is a partial
molecule in a embryo. This inequality makes obvious that the ﬁnal vol-
ume after the whole process of condensation is small. As an example of
condensation of water vapor in normal external conditions. Suppose that
1000 we see that
supersaturation is somewhere

5. Then because vv/vl ∼

the ﬁnal volume of a new phase is very small

∼

∼

≫

We see that the value δr has to take the same order of magnitude as
the mean distance between objects of a new phase rmean. Really, when δr
attains imaginary value rmean it means that the process of nucleation stops.
So, namely the values at this moment are the ﬁnal ones and the main ones.
Then

rmean ∼

δr

The same will be valid for all other ﬁrst order transitions.

Consider the opposite transition from the liquid to the vapor phase. We
shall see the opposite inequality. But we know that compressibility of liquid
is very law. So, the relative super streching is rather low. It means that the
vapor phase in a ﬁnal state will occupy some rather small volume. And again
we see that the mean distance between the objects of a new phase is many
times greater than the size of objects. Again we get the same result.

We see that the following fact takes place: The relative ﬁnal volume of a

new phase will be small.

To see that (5) takes place we needn’t to consider the real ﬁnal volume
of a new phase after phase transition but can take the values at the end of
nucleation. Because the relative quantity of surplus substance condensed in a
new phase has an order Γ−1 (at least under the collective regime of substance
consumption [2]) we see that the relative volume occupied by a new phase is
limited from above by a value of an order Γ−1. So

rmean ∼
and the required property is established.

RΓ1/3

So, we see the required property for moderate eﬀects of depleted zones.

When the eﬀect of depletion zones is strong we can use at r

This result was obtained for transition from vapor phase into a liquid
phase but there is no diﬀerence because the kinetic mechanismremains the
same.

One can see that expressions (1), (2) and (6), (7) are absolutely diﬀerent
in analytical structure. The same is valid when we compare (1), (2) and (6),
(7) numerically.

On the base of proﬁle we can easily get all results of the nucleation process.

formation in [4] was done with partial shift of coordinate r
R to r which is
wrong and beside this isn’t necessary.

−

We see that these approaches give absolutely diﬀerent results.
The next step is an obvious remark that the probability dp that an embryo
appears during elementary interval dt at the distance from r up to r + dr
from the center of the already appeared embryo is

dp = dt4πr2I(r, t)

Then the probability dP that the embryo appears in the layer from R up to
r is

dP = dt

4πr′2I(r′, t)dr′

(10)

This expression diﬀers from [4] where the following expression was pre-

sented

dP = dt

4πr2I(r′, t)dr′

The last expression is wrong and we shall follow (10).

The next step used in [4] is to come to an integral value P which is the
probability that in a sphere of radius r around already existing embryo there
will be no appearance of a new embryo. Certainly we can start from (10)

and integrate it. But it is necessarfy to take into account that the zone of
depletion will grow according to the absolutely precise law. This law was
established in [2]. But here we suppose1 that one can act in another manner
and write

P = exp(

4πr′2I(r′, t′)dr′dt′)

(11)

The last expression analogous to those which forms the base for further
constructions in2 [4] is rather doubtful. The problem appears because now
we are coming to characteristic of a whole process of nucleation (earlier there
was a proﬁle around a solitary object of a new phase).

For a ”solitary subsystem” the derivation of (11) is evident: Let

dp = dtI

be a probability that during an elementary interval dt there will be appear-
ance of a new embryo. The value of dt is rather small. Then dp is proportional
to dt and to the rate of nucleation I (here the sense of the nucletaion rate as
a probability is used). Then the probability for the absence of appearance is

dp′ = 1

dp = 1

The real problem is how to take into account the overlapping of density
proﬁles initiated by diﬀerent embryos. This problem was solved in [2]. The
exponential form (11) for P is some rather arbitrary interpretation of the
value ”the free volume” used in [2]. Now we shall discuss this interpretation
in frames of the approximation of solitary droplet.

The overlapping of exhausted regions (ER) requires to use instead of (8) -
(9)another approximation where instead of one proﬁle there is a superposition
of proﬁles. Certainly it is impossible to calculate this superposition precisely.
Then one will come to some models analogous to formulated in [2].

One can directly use the results from [2] here. When the free volume [2]
is calculated as function of time one can determine the total nucleation rate
as a ratio of the free volume to the whole volume of a system and use then
(12).

The real problem is what consequences can we make from a knowledge
of P . On one hand it seems that the knowledge of P solves al problems in
knetics of the global nucleation stage. Really, having presented P in a form

−
where L(r, t) is some expression one can approximately estimate the average
radius of a sphere where there will be no appearance by relation

P = exp(

L(r, t))

L(r, t

→ ∞

)

|r=r0 = 1

This construction analogous to [4] needs two remarks.

This estimate makes no diﬀerence between embryos appeared earlier or
later during the nucleation stage. It means that this approximation supposes
that the spectrum of droplets sizes is monodisperce one.
It isn’t correct
assumption and can be treated only as a rough estimate.

It is known that sometimes the overlapping of proﬁles is important and
makes the main contribution in nucleation kinetics. This phenomena can
occur when the substance exchange regime is goimg to be a free molecular
one and when the long tails of proﬁles are important. The ﬁrst situation can
not be realized here. The last situation was a metter of separate consideration
in [6].

In [2] an integral deﬁnition of a boundary of ER allowed to take into
account the situation of long tails. Here this situation can not be considered,
It means that the value of r0 is
because the level type deﬁnition is used.
determines as a value when L attains some level (= 1). The deﬁnition of

7

level type can not take into account long tails and it is more convenient
to use approach from [2]. Here this approach is considered because it is
analogous to [4].

When the value of r0 is determined it is easy to estimate the total average

number of droplets N as

N =

3
4π

r−3
0

(the coeﬃcient 3

4π can be omitted, this depends on interpretation of r0).

To fulﬁll concrete calculations one can use the following approach. Note

that P can be in any case presented as

P = exp(

∞

dt′

r

Z

rl

− Z
0

dr′4πr′2 exp(f (r′, t′))

The lower limit rl of integration has to be put rl = R for models with
explicit boundary of an embryo and for models with Green function rl = 0.
But because δr
R the eﬀect of the lower limit will be small and we can
put rl = 0 in ll situations. Certainly, for P due to the exponential form
the eﬀect is essential, but when we are calculating the mean distances the
essential dependence on rl disappears due to δr
R. In the last equation f
is some function with explicit form given by solution of diﬀusion equation.

≫

≫

One can see that in f (r, t) two variables has to appear in combination
β = t/r2 or β′ = t/(r
R)2 . The dependence on t and r via β is the main one
(in special regimes of mother phase consumption there may be dependence on
t, r in another combination, but this dependence will be much more smooth
R the diﬀerence in substitution β′ instead of β
than via β). Because δR
will be small (not in P , but on mean distances and times).

This approximate equality is very important. Namely this equality allows to
determine the mean distance between droplets as N −1/3, or as r0 or according
to the sense of P . Three ways are available. They have to give similar results.
This fact is ensured by this approximate coincidence. Then the third way
gives

we see that ¯r is two times smaller than the mean distance between embryos.
It is clear because the mean distance between embryos is two mean distances
until the boundary of exhaustion zone r0. So, we observe a coincidence.
Certainly, one can calculate integrals more precisely.

The average time of waiting fro the appearance of new embryo near the
already existing one is directly and elementary connected with a mean dis-
tance between embryos and we needn’t to calculate it separately4.

3This value is calculated in [4] in a wrong way.

But we have to stress that this result has practically no meaning because
as it is stated in [7] the eﬀect of interaction leads to decrease of ﬂuctuation
of the total number of droplets. The right numerical value of this eﬀect is
given in [8]. Here we have absolutely no interaction between droplets and
this result has to be seriously changed due to interaction. An example of
such account is given in [9].

To close this question we shall construct now more precise solutions of

diﬀusion equation. They have to be used in (4) and then in (11)

We shall start with the following model. There exists a more general

solution [5].

Really the rate of embryo growth is so small that the stationary distribu-

practically precise and takes into acound the variation of mother phase con-
sumption by an embryo.

in the system with spherical symmetry can be transformed by substitution

1 Numerical results

We have calculated the worst situation when vv/vp = 10 for vapor-liquid
transition. Here we have taken G = 13 which is the minimal value for
macroscopic description of the critical embryo. when vv/vl and G increase
the accuracy of approach (6) and partially the accuracy of approach (15.
The accuracy of (1) decreases because the error in (1) depends mainly on the
property of relative stationarity which has no connection with values of Γ.
It isn’t so evident that the property vv/vl ≫
1 also has no inﬂuence on the
error of (1) because here only the relative variation of radius is important.
But when Γ increases it means that the main important region of solution
now corresponds to the asymptote where the quakitative behavior of (1) is
wrong. So, we came to conclusion that it isn’t possible to use (1). The
error produced by (1) is seen already at Γ = 13. Figure 1 illustrates the
behavior of diﬀerent proﬁles in this situation. One can see four lines there.
One line is apart from all other and it has the diﬀerent asymptotic behavior.
This is solution (1). Other lines are solutions of diﬀusion problem and some
approximations. One of them (the highest) is thick because actually there
are two formally coinciding solutions: precise solution and approximation
(15). The coincidence is formal. In the middle of this group one can ﬁnd
numerical solution with prescribed law of droplet radius growth R = At1/2
(it is obtained by linear extrapolation of results of precise solution). The
diﬀerence between these curve and precise self consistent solution is caused
by numerical errors and corrections on radius growth. the lowest curve in this
group is approximation (6). One can see that both (6) and (15) give good
for natural situations with big values of Γ and vv/vl the accuracy
results.

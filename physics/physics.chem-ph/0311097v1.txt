A non-empirical minimal atomic multipole expansion (MAME) deﬁnes atomic charges or higher
multipoles that reproduce electrostatic potential outside molecules. MAME eliminates problems
associated with redundancy and with statistical sampling, and produces atomic multipoles in line
with chemical intuition.

The problem of representing the electrostatic poten-
tial outside a molecule using atomic charges or higher
atomic multipoles is very important for understanding
intermolecular forces. Atomic partial charges, an impor-
tant part of chemical intuition, are deﬁned in many diﬀer-
ent ways for diﬀerent purposes. Chemically-derived (CD)
charges, such as Mulliken1 or L¨owdin2, often describe
molecular ﬁelds poorly.3 More recent schemes partition
molecular density into atomic regions, which may or may
not overlap.4 Similar approaches have been developed for
solids.5 Most attractive for our purposes are potential-
derived (PD) charges, which avoid representation of the
density by producing the ‘best’ ﬁt to the molecular poten-
tial directly.6,7 Atomic dipoles and quadrupoles7 are of-
ten used to increase accuracy in solvation problems8 and
force ﬁeld calculations.9 Induced atomic dipoles appear
naturally in electronic polarization of molecular solids10
to account for the small part of molecular polarization
that is due to the deformation of atomic orbitals and is
not captured by redistribution of charges.

Computational schemes for PD multipoles such as
Merz-Kollman (MK),11 CHelp12, or CHelpG13 diﬀer
mainly in the sampling domain and the resulting atomic
charges are strongly method-dependent.14 Worse still,
PD methods often yield atomic charges that are counter-
intuitive, such as negative charges on hydrogens in
alkanes.15 Higher multipoles only increase the redundan-
cies inherent in distributed multipole analysis, improving
on the accuracy of the ﬁeld at the expense of instability in
the multipole values. The severity of the problem can be
somewhat reduced with SVD techniques,16,14 or by intro-
ducing restraints.17 Our approach does not use sampling
and eliminates redundancies before they appear.

We approximate the true molecular potential, φ(r), as
a sum of multipoles of strength qk centered at nuclear
positions ri,

φ(r) ≈ φapprox(r) =

qkφk(r − ri)

(1)

Xi Xk

where φk(r) is the potential due to the kth multipole of
unit strength: φk(r) = 1/r for charge, (n · r)/r3 for a
dipole in the direction n, and so on. Since ∇2φapprox = 0
everywhere except at ri, but ∇2φ = 4πρ(r), the atomic
multipole expansion can only be accurate in regions
where ρ(r) ≈ 0. Furthermore, φ on any closed surface

S on which ρ = 0, determines φ(r) everywhere outside
S. We therefore choose S to be an isodensity surface,
ρ(r) = f , where f is suﬃciently small to ensure negli-
gible charge beyond S, but with suﬃcient potential on
S for a determining ﬁt (Fig. 1). We chose φapprox to

Fig. 1 Electrostatic potential over isodensity surface S of
−4 au. produces S at ∼ 1.4 ˚A
pentane. Here f = 5 × 10
from the hydrogens and leaves −0.2e charge outside. Missing
charge is negligible for f = 10

−4, with S at 1.8 ˚A.

The crucial issue remaining is the choice of a set of
multipoles. We choose a minimal set, usually one scalar

1

value per atom, and add additional multipoles to describe
lone pairs when necessary, based on the Lewis structure.
This carefully chosen minimal atomic multipole expan-
sion (MAME) set avoids redundancies but is within ∼ 1
mH everywhere beyond S.

We illustrate MAME with three molecules: n-pentane,
which is a classic example of diﬃculties encountered in
PD schemes; glycine (standard and zwitterion), as a typ-
ical application in biochemistry; and water, to see how
general MAME rules apply to a small polar molecule. All
densities and potentials are produced on a cubic mesh by
the Gaussian 98 program,18 at the B3LYP/aug-cc-pVTZ
level (6-311++G** for pentane). Surface integrals (3)
are computed by triangulation of S. The program runs
within a few seconds, and is available on request.

Figure 1 shows φ(r) on S for n-pentane. Red spots
(φ > 0) show an excess of positive charge near each hy-
drogen, but all PD schemes tested yield some or all hy-
drogens negative. Closer inspection of Fig. 1 reveals that
the positive regions occupy less solid angle around hydro-
gens than would be produced by a positive charge. Such
a potential is consistent with a dipole with a negative
charge pointing inwards.

Our ﬁrst rule is therefore to assign a charge to all nuclei
but protons, to which we assign a dipole moment instead.
The hydrogen atom is special as its sole electron partic-
ipates in the bond, leaving no electron density centered
on the proton. This unique property of hydrogens is well-
known in X-ray structure analysis, which systematically
underestimates the C—H bond lengths for this reason.

Mulliken charges are intuitively meaningful but pro-
duce large errors in the potential (Table 1). PD charges
are negative on some hydrogens and still give signiﬁ-
cant errors. Adding dipoles reduces the potential error,
but at the cost of producing meaningless multipoles.15
Our scheme with charges on all atoms produces similar

(though better) results, but we do far better (line 2) when
the charges on hydrogens are replaced with dipoles. All
dipoles come out similar in magnitude (numbers in brack-
ets, in au.) and point toward C within 20◦ of the H—C
bond. The hydrogen dipoles can be safely restricted to
lie along the H—C bonds (last line) with the accuracy
still better than that of charges. All multipoles have rea-
sonable values, including small charges on carbons. Note
that we have now described the ﬁeld outside the molecule
more accurately than any existing scheme, with only one
parameter per nuclues (a charge on each carbon and a
bond-directed dipole on each hydrogen).

The same choice of multipoles yields a 1.05 mH error
(=2%) in the glycine zwitterion, (NH3)+–CH2–COO−,
down from 4% with charges alone and 4%—6% with stan-
dard PD schemes. The glycine zwitterion is highly polar
with dipole µ = 10.3 D, which MAME recovers within
0.1% accuracy.

Table 2 lists MAME results for glycine in its standard
form, NH2–CH2–COOH, and illustrates the need for spe-
cial treatment of lone pairs. In the zwitterion, the NH3
group is well-described by a charge on N and three dipoles
on hydrogens, similar to methyls in pentane. The NH2
group in glycine lacks one site, but has extra electron
density associated with the lone pair. We thus assign a
dipole moment to N, in addition to its charge, restricted
along the sp3 direction of the lone pair.

Similarly, each oxygen has two lone pairs. Two dipoles
for the two lone pairs sum to just one dipole along the
symmetry axis, leading to only one variational parame-
ter. The potential of this single dipole, however, is axially
symmetric, whereas the potential around the oxygen de-
viates from axial symmetry due to the particular orienta-
tion of the lone pairs. Such a deviation can be accounted
for with a quadrupole moment on the oxygen. The ﬁnite
system of charges sketched in the inset in Fig. 2 shows
what is needed. Computing a multipole expansion of
three charges we describe two lone pairs with two scalar
parameters, a dipole µr restricted along the symmetry
axis, and a restricted quadrupole θr which has angle β as
a ﬁxed parameter (β = 120◦ for O= and 109.7◦ for O–,
due to sp2 and sp3 hybridization respectively). θr and
µr are chosen negative with “−” pointing outside. Table
2 shows a clear advantage of such a multipole set.

To make the deﬁnition more transparent, θr can
be expressed in the conventional form as a carefully
crafted combination of θzz = θr(3 cos2 β/2 − 1), θyy =
θr(3 sin2 β/2 − 1), θxx = −θr, and θxy = θxz = θyz = 0,

2

which depend on a single scalar parameter θr. Here z is
along the symmetry axis, and the lone pairs are in the
yz-plane. A single restricted quadrupole of strength θr
creates the potential

φquad(r) = θr

3(r · n1)2 + 3(r · n2)2 − 2r2
2r5

,

(5)

where n1 and n2 are the directions of the lone pairs.

For the zwitterion, MAME does not require θr on the
oxygens, because of the resonance. Lone pairs in the sp2
and sp3 conﬁgurations lie in perpendicular planes, virtu-
ally destroying any asymmetry.

MAME accuracy improves away from the molecule
(Fig. 2). If f is too large (10−3), there is a net charge
inside S which strongly aﬀects the asymptotic behavior.
This can be repaired by ﬁxing the total charge using a
Lagrange multiplier.16 Figure 2 demonstrates MAME’s
insensitivity to choice of f , provided the total charge is
correct.

Last, we analyze the water molecule. The ﬁrst rule
leads to two dipoles on hydrogens pointing along the
bonds, sketched in Fig. 3. The charge on oxygen is
zero because the molecule is neutral. The dipoles are
equal due to symmetry and require no calculation since
their vector sum must yield the dipole moment of water,
1.847D (B3LYP/aug-cc-pVTZ value). This already re-
duces the error to 21%, from 45% with a single dipole on
oxygen. The two distributed dipoles yield Θxx − Θyy =
4.06 D˚A for the quadrupole moment of water, whereas
experiment19 gives 5.12 D˚A. We note that Θxx − Θyy
is the only invariant combination of quadrupole compo-
nents, since the ﬁnite dipole makes them dependent on
the center of coordinates.

We next add µr and θr multipoles on the oxygen to
describe the correction due to lone pairs, and we ﬁnd ex-
cellent accuracy eσ = 0.59 mH (< 3%) on and beyond
S (1.56˚A from H and 2.11˚A from O, f = 10−4). The
sp3 choice of β = 109.5◦ in θr is crucial: accuracy dete-
riorates dramatically (to 12%) when β is changed to e.g.
180◦ (θr replaced with θyy). The sp3 description of the
oxygen lone pairs is appropriate due to invariance under
unitary rotations of occupied orbitals.

In conclusion, molecular ﬁelds are represented to chem-
ical accuracy with a minimal set of atomic multipoles
carefully chosen based on the Lewis structure of the
molecule. All H atoms are represented as dipoles. Lone
pairs are treated with extra multipoles, avoiding addi-
tional oﬀ-nuclear expansion sites.20 The scheme yields
multipole values that conform to chemical intuition, are
unique, fully rotationally-invariant and free of sampling
errors.

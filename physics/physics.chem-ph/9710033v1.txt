We present a novel approximation scheme for the calculation of the principal excitation energies
and transition moments of ﬁnite many–body systems. The scheme is derived from a ﬁrst order
approximation to the self energy of a recently proposed extended particle–hole Green’s function.
A hermitian eigenvalue problem is encountered of the same size as the well–known Random Phase
Approximation (RPA). We ﬁnd that it yields a size consistent description of the excitation properties
and removes an inconsistent treatment of the ground state correlation by the RPA. By presenting
a hermitian eigenvalue problem the new scheme avoids the instabilities of the RPA and should
be well suited for large scale numerical calculations. These and additional properties of the new
approximation scheme are illuminated by a very simple exactly solvable model.

INTRODUCTION

Many–body Green’s function theory has provided several standard approximation schemes for the calculation of
excitation properties in atoms, molecules, and atomic nuclei. Setting out from a convenient single–particle description
like the Hartree–Fock approximation, these schemes usually lead to a matrix eigenvalue problem. This supplies
approximations for the excitation energies and transition operator matrix elements of the system. The starting point
is usually the well–known polarisation propagator [1], a fundamental two–particle Green’s function of nonrelativistic
many–body theory. It is given by a sum of two terms that are related by symmetry (see e. g. Ref. [2]).

Πrs,r′s′ (ω) = Πph

rs,r′s′(ω) + Πhp

rs,r′s′ (ω)

(1)

The so–called particle–hole part Πph
rs,r′s′ (ω) already contains all the physically relevant information exhibiting single
poles in the energy variable ω at the exact excitation energies of the system. Its name originates in the single particle
picture which is usually taken as the zeroth order in a perturbation theoretical treatment. Zeroth order contributions
to Πph only arise if the indices r and r′ are particle indices and s and s′ hole indices. We speak of a particle index if it
refers to a virtual single–particle state, i. e. a state which is not occupied in a Slater determinant ground state whereas
a hole index refers to an occupied single–particle state. The particle–hole part thus primarily describes excitations
which, in a single–particle picture, may be understood as lifting one fermion from an occupied orbital to a virtual
one. In a correlated system, however, there are no fully occupied or fully virtual single–particle states and thus the
exact particle–hole part contributes also for index pairs (r, s) other than particle–hole index pairs.

The various approximation schemes may be classiﬁed by the order in which the correlation is taken into account.

Another criterion for classiﬁcation is which parts of the polarisation propagator are included.

Another group of approximations results from including the second part of the polarisation propagator Πhp

A simple ﬁrst order approximation scheme based on Πph is the so–called Tamm–Dancoﬀ Approximation (TDA)
[1,3]. It can be seen as the ﬁrst order approximation to the inverse matrix of the particle–hole part. In a quantum
chemical language the TDA may be understood as treating the excited states on the single–excitation Conﬁguration
Interaction (SCI) level in comparison to an uncorrelated ground state. The Algebraic Diagrammatic Construction
(ADC) approach [2,4] represents a family of systematic higher order approximation schemes to the particle–hole part.
rs,r′s′ (ω).
This part is called hole–particle part because its zeroth order vanishes unless r and r′ are hole indices and s and s′
are particle indices. In contrast to the particle–hole part its poles appear at the negative excitation energies. The
fundamental ﬁrst order approximation scheme which treats both parts of the polarisation propagator on an equal
footing is the so–called Random Phase Approximation (RPA) [5,6,1,3]. Among the many diﬀerent ways of deriving
this approximation we want to focus on the role of the RPA as the ﬁrst order approximation to the inverse matrix
of the polarisation propagator (1). Naturally this matrix now comprises the set of particle–hole as well as hole–
particle conﬁgurations and therefore has twice the dimension of the TDA matrix. Among the higher order schemes
that treat both parts of the polarisation propagator we want to mention the Second Order Polarisation Propagator
Approximation (SOPPA) [7,8,9] and the Equation of Motion (EOM) method [6,10].

In the Conﬁguration Interaction picture the RPA may be seen to include ground state correlation in addition
to the correlation of the excited states already accounted for in the TDA [8,11]. The RPA does so, however, in a
non–variational manner and thus it is not obvious that the RPA yields improved results compared to the TDA. It
has rather been observed that in certain cases the RPA excitation energies are worse than those of the TDA, also
in systems where correlation of the ground state is of special importance (for exemplary numerical comparisons see
e. g. [12,13]). In fact we will see later that the inﬂuence of ground state correlation onto the RPA excitation energies
has to be regarded inconsistent with Rayleigh–Schr¨odinger perturbation theory (see also Ref. [2]). We will further
study a simple model system for which the RPA gives much poorer results than the TDA. For this example a new
approximation method, called First Order Static Excitation Potential (FOSEP), yields the exact solution while posing
a matrix eigenvalue problem of the same size as the RPA. Also a perturbation theoretical analysis shows that FOSEP
consistently includes ground state correlation.

The FOSEP method is a ﬁrst order approximation scheme that is derived from an extended particle–hole Green’s
function [14] where additionally to the particle–hole and the hole–particle parts other propagator terms are present:
The polarisation propagator has been augmented by combinations of single–particle propagators that give rise to
additional zeroth order contributions in the particle–particle and the hole–hole index space. The introduced terms
are chosen such that the extended Green’s function now satisﬁes a Dyson equation which in turn deﬁnes a well–
behaved (particle–hole) self energy in analogy to the fundamental single–particle Green’s function [1,15,16]. Earlier
we have applied the general procedure to the particle–particle propagator, another well–known two–particle Green’s
function. We could show that the self–energy of a suitably chosen extended two–particle Green’s function serves as an
optical potential for elastic scattering of two–particle projectiles [17]. The particle–hole self energy, in turn, may be
understood as a sort of “optical potential for particle–hole excitations”, some general aspects of which are discussed
in Ref. [14].

This paper is organised as follows: After a brief review of the relevant construction principles of the extended
particle–hole Green’s functions we will deﬁne the FOSEP approximation and discuss the structure of the corresponding
matrix eigenvalue problem in Sec. I. In the next section the properties of the FOSEP approximation for excitation
energies and transition moments are investigated on a formal level. First the similarity to the RPA equations is
pointed out in order to compare the properties of the two approximations (II A). Both schemes share the fundamental
properties of size consistency (II B) and the invariance under unitary transformations of the occupied or virtual
Hartree–Fock orbitals (II C). The diﬀerences between the two approximations will become apparent in Sec. II D when
we will perform a perturbation theoretical analysis of the excitation energies up to second order. This analysis shows
that the FOSEP approximation includes part of the ground state correlation in a consistent way while the RPA
proves inconsistent with perturbation theory in this respect. It follows an analysis of the approximation for transition
moments which is found to be consistent in ﬁrst order. The last paragraph of Sec. II deals with the equivalence
of length and velocity form of the transition moments of the dipole operator which are important for the so–called
oscillator strengths. In Sec. III the FOSEP method is compared with the RPA and TDA in application to a simple
exactly solvable model system.

I. THE FOSEP APPROXIMATION

The extended particle–hole Green’s function is one species in a family of two–particle propagators that fulﬁl Dyson’s
equation. The general theory has been developed in Ref. [14,17]. Here we will only outline the main ideas that are
relevant in the present context. The desired physical information like excitation energies and transition moments is
contained in the poles and residues of the extended Green’s function. Calculating these is equivalent to solving the
eigenvalue problem related to a generalised excitation energy operator ˆ
which lives in an extended Hilbert space Y.

Throughout this paper we assume a discrete eigenvalue spectrum for the relevant Hamiltonians since we are interested
in ﬁnite basis set approximations. The generalisation to continuous spectra, however, poses no particular problem.

perturbation theory.

, however, not all of the eigenvalues and
eigenvectors of Eq. (14) correspond to “physical” excitations. More insight may be gained by looking at the particular
block structure of this eigenvalue problem which is revealed when splitting the set of index pairs according to whether
the indices relate to occupied (hole) or unoccupied (virtual or particle) orbitals. In zeroth order only the diagonal
matrix ε is present and the distinction between “physical” and “unphysical” excitations is obvious, since the ground
state is approximated by a Slater determinant. In this case excitations of a single particle are possible only from an
occupied into a virtual orbital. Thus only the ph–ph block is “physical”. In the ﬁrst order (FOSEP) approximation
the secular matrix has the following structure:

First of all we notice that the FOSEP self energy

F OSEP does not contribute at all for pairs of orbitals that are
both occupied (hh) or both virtual (pp) and only the zeroth order matrix ε remains. Thus the hh–hh and pp–pp blocks
decouple from the rest of the matrix and the eigenvalue problem (14) for these blocks becomes trivial, simply yielding
the Hartree–Fock orbital energy diﬀerences. These blocks are obviously not correlated in the ﬁrst order treatment.
We want to mention that this decoupling of the hh–hh and pp–pp blocks is special to the Møller–Plesset partitioning
of the Hamiltonian and to the particular choice of the extended states
considered in this paper. It does not
appear for other choices discussed in Ref. [14]. The decoupling leads to a considerable reduction of numerical eﬀort
and therefore justiﬁes the present choice. Many of the properties discussed in the present paper, however, generalise
also to ﬁrst order approximations based upon other choices for the primary extended states

conﬁguration. In fact, diagonalising the ph–ph block εph + V on its own results in the well–known Tamm–Dancoﬀ
Approximation (TDA) [1]. The coupling W to the hp–hp block can be understood as taking into account ground state
correlation as will be explained later with the help of perturbation theoretical arguments. A similar coupling also
appears in the Random Phase Approximation (RPA) [1]. The relation of our approach to the RPA will be discussed
in detail below.

The hp–hp block by itself does not seem very physical in character at all. Its zeroth order excitation energies are
negative and result from creating a hole in a virtual orbital and a particle in an occupied orbital. Nevertheless, the
hp–hp block couples through the matrix

with the physical ph–ph block and thus introduces a correction to the Tamm–Dancoﬀ excitation energies. Due to

This is the eigenvalue problem that has to be solved in the FOSEP approximation scheme. In contrast to the RPA it
is a hermitian eigenvalue problem always yielding real eigenvalues. In fact, in most cases the matrix M F OSEP is real
symmetric.

As long as the interaction remains weak enough, there is a clear distinction between “physical” eigenvalues of this
matrix and “unphysical” ones by the sign of these energies. Even with stronger interaction the distinction may still
be valid. This is understood easily when considering a model system where the ph–ph block has the dimension one
and all matrix elements are real. The matrix M F OSEP then is two by two and its eigenvalues are given by

II. PROPERTIES OF THE FOSEP APPROXIMATION

In this chapter we will discuss some general properties of the FOSEP approximation. In order to elucidate the
relation to the well known ﬁrst order approximation schemes RPA and TDA we start with brieﬂy reformulating the
RPA in our notation. We go on with considering two fundamental invariances FOSEP shares with RPA and TDA
namely size consistency and invariance with respect to unitary transformations of the single–particle basis. In order to
show the diﬀerences between the three schemes we will carry out a perturbation theoretical analysis for the excitation
energies as well as for the transition moments. Finally, the equivalence of length and velocity form of the dipole
operator transition moments is discussed.

A. Relation to the RPA

The Random Phase Approximation (RPA) [1,3] for the calculation of excitation energies and transition operator
matrix elements in ﬁnite Fermi systems may be derived and understood in many diﬀerent ways. Traditionally the
RPA is derived by the inﬁnite summation of a certain type of diagrams in the Feynman–Dyson perturbation series
of the polarisation propagator [5]. Equivalently it can be understood as a ﬁrst order approximation to the integral
kernel of the Bethe–Salpeter equation [20] or as a speciﬁc ﬁrst order approximation in the equation of motion of the
polarisation propagator [6,8]. Now we are going to present the RPA equations in a form suitable for comparison with
FOSEP.

Based upon a Hartree–Fock zeroth order the RPA is deﬁned by the following eigenvalue problem [21]:

The matrix ε is deﬁned like above in Eq. (10). The RPA kernel R consists of the matrix elements Rrs,r′s′ = Vrs′[sr′]
and the metrical matrix m by

ε m + R
(cid:1)

x = ω m x

Note that in block matrix notation m can be written as

rs,r′s′ = δrr′δss′ (nrns −

nrns).

m
(cid:2)

(cid:3)

−
All these matrices are indexed by pairs of single–particle indices that are required to be either particle–hole or hole–
particle index pairs. Thus the RPA eigenvalue problem has the same size as the FOSEP one (19). The essential
diﬀerence is the appearance of the indeﬁnite metric m in the RPA case which renders the RPA problem a non–
hermitian eigenvalue problem. As a consequence the RPA may become instable and lead to complex eigenvalues [8].
The RPA kernel R is related to the FOSEP self energy

with x′ = m x. Comparing the RPA (26, 25) with the FOSEP eigenvalue problem (19, 20) we see that both have
the same size and start from the same input data while the diﬀerence lies in some minus signs. Before analysing the
diﬀerences further we want to discuss two fundamental properties that are shared by both schemes.

B. Size Consistency of FOSEP

The question of size consistency of a many–body method is the question of whether the resulting approximations
for physical quantities scale correctly with the size of the system [22,23]. The general question is diﬃcult to answer
and usually one has to resort to simple models or numerical calculations. Nevertheless, this concept becomes very
important for applications to large or extended systems. In the context of ﬁnite systems, especially molecules, the so–
called separate fragment model provides a useful test of correct scaling behaviour. We consider a many–body system
consisting of two or more separate (noninteracting) subsystems (fragments). Size consistency of excitation energies
and transition moments then means that an excitation that is local to one of the subsystems is approximated with
the same result regardless whether the approximation scheme is applied to the full system or only to the fragment. A
suﬃcient but not necessary condition for this property is that the secular equations of the approximation scheme give
rise to independent sets of equations corresponding to local excitations on the individual subsystems. This ‘a priori’
decoupling of independent, local equations is known as the separability property [24].

The separability of FOSEP and RPA is proven by the following arguments: In the model of separating fragments
the Hamiltonian of the full system is given by the sum of the Hamiltonians of the subsystems. This implies that the
(Hartree–Fock) single–particle states ϕr may be chosen local to either fragment and that the matrix elements of the
two–body interaction Vijkl vanish unless all indices ijkl relate to states belonging to the same subsystem. From the
deﬁnition of the FOSEP matrix (13, 20) and the RPA matrix (25) it therefore becomes clear that both methods have
the separability property and thus can be regarded size consistent. The same arguments apply to the TDA to which
the FOSEP and RPA reduce in the case of vanishing coupling W as explained in Sec. I. For nonlocal excitations the
excitation energy is simply given by the diﬀerence of the single–particle (Hartree–Fock) energies for all three schemes.
This means that the level of approximation is that of Koopman’s theorem which provides a consistent ﬁrst order
description. We want to mention that the separability property is by no means a matter of course for more accurate
many–body methods like, for example, the general CI method [25].

C. Unitary Transformations of Single–Particle Orbitals

In order to separate the inﬂuence of ﬁnite truncations of the underlying single–particle basis from the systematic
deﬁciencies of a given approximation scheme it is important that the approximation is invariant with respect to
rotations of the single–particle basis. A global invariance is self–evident only for ‘exact’ methods like full CI. Systematic
truncations of the CI matrix employing single, double, or triple excitations on a given reference conﬁguration are at
least invariant with respect to transformations of the single particle basis that do not mix occupied and virtual orbitals.
Such an invariance usually does not apply for perturbative propagator methods. The FOSEP method as well as the
RPA and the TDA, however, share this invariance with the CI whereas higher order methods usually do not. For the
SOPPA method the inﬂuences of rotations of the orbital set have been investigated numerically [26].

A physical motivation for altering the single–particle functions may be drawn from the fact that the Hartree–Fock
virtual orbitals describe additional test particles in a mean ﬁeld and therefore constitute rather diﬀuse functions while
the main eﬀects of correlation show up at short range due to ineﬀective screening. Thus one can hope to achieve a
better description of the inﬂuence of correlation with more localised virtual orbitals than the Hartree–Fock ones.

Within a perturbation theoretical approach a unitary transformation within the set of virtual single–particle states
can be realised by adding a (hermitian) single–particle potential to ˆHo of Eq. (6) that takes eﬀect only on the virtual
orbitals and subtracting it again from ˆH1 of Eq. (7). The new single–particle basis is then deﬁned as the diagonalising
basis for the new zeroth order Hamiltonian. Obviously the new basis is connected to the original one by a unitary
transformation that leaves invariant the occupied single–particle states and also does not aﬀect the Slater determinant
preserving the distinction between occupied and virtual single–particle states. From the deﬁnitions of the matrices

(10, 13) it can be seen that such a transformation of the single–particle basis also results in a unitary transformation of
the secular matrix in (14) which preserves its block structure (16). Therefore also the FOSEP eigenvalue problem (19,
20) transforms without changing its eigenvalues. This argumentation can be transferred analogously to the closely
related RPA and TDA. Summarising, we have seen that the FOSEP approximation as well as the RPA and TDA
are invariant under unitary transformations within the set of virtual single–particle states. It is easily seen that this
property generalises to unitary transformations of the orbital basis that do not mix occupied and virtual orbitals.

In a much more general sense, however, the matrix

of the excitation energy operator ˆ

of Eq. (5) which forms the primary block of the matrix
is invariant under (unrestricted) unitary transformations of the

(see also Eq. (A1) in the appendix) is the exact ground
state of the system, the invariance properties of an approximation to

particles which interact only with a one–particle potential, the primary block

In this case the ﬁrst order already provides the exact solution for the excitation energies and is invariant
with respect to any unitary transformations of the single–particle basis. This property is explained in more detail in
Ref. [14].

D. Perturbation Theoretical Analysis of the Excitation Energies

In order to analyse the diﬀerences between the FOSEP approximation, the RPA, and the TDA we will now perform
a perturbation theoretical analysis of the excitation energies up to second order and compare with straightforward
Rayleigh–Schr¨odinger perturbation theory following Ref. [2]. Usually the Rayleigh–Schr¨odinger series itself is not a
reliable method for calculating energies of excited states but it is very helpful for analysing and comparing diﬀerent
approximation schemes.

We assume that the Rayleigh–Schr¨odinger series starting from the singly excited Slater determinant

An expression for the second order excitation energy can be gained by subtracting the expressions for the ground
state energy E0 from the excited state energy Eαβ. Up to second order the ground state energy is given by the familiar
expression

is cancelled by contributions from the excited state.
We are now in the position to compare with the second order excitation energies from the TDA, the RPA, and
the FOSEP scheme. The approximations for the excitation energies in these schemes are found by solving the
eigenvalue problem related to the corresponding matrix. Basic matrix perturbation expansion leads to the second
order approximation for the eigenvalue. We ﬁnd the following:

corresponding to the special cases where i = α or k = β in the sum

αβ

All three approximation schemes are consistent in ﬁrst order with the Rayleigh–Schr¨odinger expression (30). Therefore
they are correctly referred to as ﬁrst order schemes. The zeroth and ﬁrst order contribution ∆Eαβ(1) originate in
the diagonal matrix elements of the ph–ph block (TDA block) of the matrices M F OSEP and M RP A of Eqs. (19, 25)
whereas the second order terms come in by the diagonalisation procedure. Neither of the three schemes reproduce
the second order expression (30) completely. This is only achieved by more accurate and more costly schemes like
ADC(2) or SOPPA.
The term U (p−h)

describes part of the second order correlation of the excited state as can be seen from Eqs. (30)
and (28, 29). It is the only second order contribution to the TDA excitation energy and originates in the oﬀ–diagonal
part of the TDA matrix which also constitutes the ph–ph block of the FOSEP matrix M F OSEP . In the FOSEP and
the RPA expressions the additional term R3
αβ is present which has already been identiﬁed as part of the ground state
correlation. Comparing with the second order perturbation expansion (30), however, we notice that it appears with
the wrong sign in the RPA excitation energy in contrast to FOSEP where the sign is consistent with the Rayleigh–
Schr¨odinger expansion. This term comes in through the coupling of the ph with the hp block in the FOSEP matrix
M F OSEP of Eq. (19) and the RPA matrix M RP A of Eq. (25), respectively. We recall that the only diﬀerence between
the FOSEP and the RPA equations are minus signs in the hp–hp blocks of the secular matrices and the RPA metric.
These carry through to the second order expressions and prove inconsistent with Rayleigh–Schr¨odinger perturbation
theory in the RPA case.

It is interesting to note that each of the three parts of Rαβ of Eq. (32) is positive. Thus the RPA always lowers
the TDA excitation energies in second order whereas the FOSEP approximation increases the energies in accordance
with the positive sign of the full correction Rαβ. Taking into account that the TDA approximates the ground state by
the variational Hartree–Fock method, it is sensible to expect an increase in the excitation energies when ground state
correlation is additionally taken into account. Therefore we may conclude that the FOSEP scheme includes ground
state correlation in a consistent way in contrast to the RPA which does not.

Concerning the term U (2p−2h)

in the full second order expression (30) which is missing in all three schemes, we
remark that it does not carry a deﬁnite sign (as can be seen from Eq. (68c) of Ref. [2]). It may, however, lower the
energy of the excited state and thus can possibly overcompensate for the inﬂuence of the ground state correlation. In
this way the RPA result may be supported by accidental numerical compensation.

E. Perturbation Theoretical Analysis of the Transition Moments

We now will show that transition operator matrix elements between the ground state and an excited state can, in

contrast to TDA, be approximated by FOSEP consistently in ﬁrst order. We consider the transition moment

Explicit expressions for these terms derive from straightforward Rayleigh–Schr¨odinger perturbation theory and may
be found in Ref. [2].

In an analogous fashion to the preceding paragraph the above expression may be compared to the result of matrix
perturbation analysis of the TDA, RPA, and FOSEP approximations for the transition moments. It is easily seen
that the FOSEP eigenvalue problem (14, 19) together with the approximation for the transition moments of Eq. (15)
leads to a consistent ﬁrst order approximation of the transition moments. For the TDA, the RPA, and the ﬁrst and
second order ADC scheme the perturbation analysis has been carried out in Ref. [2]. It has been found that the
is missing. This term is a consequence of
TDA expression is incomplete in ﬁrst order because the term
ﬁrst order ground state correlation which is neglected in the TDA. It is described correctly in the RPA which yields
consistent transition moments through ﬁrst order. This may be seen to justify the common statement that the RPA,
in contrast to the TDA, considers ground state correlation. We want to mention that the transition moments are
also described consistently through ﬁrst order in the ADC(1), an approximation that is equivalent to the TDA with
respect to the excitation energies but diﬀers for the transition moments [2].

F. The Equivalence of Length and Velocity Form of the Dipole Operator Transition Moments

Now we will focus on the transition moments of the dipole operator as a particular choice for the transition operator.
These transition moments are related to the so-called oscillator strengths and present important parameters charac-
terising the interaction of the many–body system with radiation. There is a hierarchy of equivalent representations
of the exact dipole operator transition moments, starting with the so–called length and velocity form. Without loss
of generality we consider only the z–component ˆZ of the dipole operator. The identity

expresses the equivalence between the length and the velocity form of the dipole operator transition moments deﬁned
by the left and the right hand side of this equation, respectively. The z–component of the momentum operator ˆPz is
i ˆPz provided that the Hamiltonian contains only local potentials like e. g.
related to the dipole operator by
for Coulomb interacting electrons in atoms or molecules. Eq. (38) then follows from the identity (Eλ−
=
Ψλ| h
h

It is a very special property of the RPA to preserve this equivalence exactly, provided the underlying Hartree–
Fock single–particle basis is complete [27]. In fact the RPA eigenvalue problem may be derived setting out from a CI
representation of the ground and excited state wavefunction and requiring certain ‘hypervirial relations’ which present
a slight generalisation of the above mentioned equivalences [11]. Thus the exact fulﬁlment of these hypervirial relations
may be regarded unique to the RPA while other approximation schemes show, at most, a perturbative equivalence. In
the TDA, the error between length and the velocity form is already of ﬁrst order. The same holds for the ﬁrst order
ADC approximation [28]. The FOSEP approximation, however, consistently preserves the equivalence in ﬁrst order
yielding a second order error. The proof which needs some additional formalism can be found in Ref. [14]. The result
of equivalence through ﬁrst order is another clue for the consistency of the FOSEP approximation. The second order
error between length and velocity form provides a genuine test for the validity of the approximation. Depending on
the particular aims of an approximate calculation this may seem more favourable than having an ‘a priori’ equivalence
like in the RPA which hides the actual error with respect to the exact value of the transition moments.

Note that the FOSEP approximation compares well with higher order schemes where it has been shown that the
second order ADC scheme produces a second order error [28] while the SOPPA which builds upon the RPA leads to

III. APPLICATION TO A SIMPLE MODEL

In this section we compare the FOSEP approximation with the RPA, the TDA, and the exact solution for the
excitation energies of a very simple model system. This model is commonly referred to as the Hubbard model for
the Hydrogen Molecule H2 [30]. In the model, all excitation energies can be calculated by analytic expressions in
dependence of two parameters which mimic the eﬀects of Coulomb interaction.

A. Deﬁnition of the Model and Exact Solution

The Hubbard model for the diatomic Hydrogen molecule represents each atomic site (R and R’) by a single orbital

electronic level denoted by

Additionally a two–particle interaction term is present which yields a positive energy U whenever one level is occupied

that all interactions are independent of electron spin.

The excitation energies ∆Ei are deﬁned as usual by the diﬀerence of the excited state’s energy Ei to the ground state

Note that the expansion of ∆Ei into a power series in λ yields the Rayleigh–Schr¨odinger series of the excitation
energies which has been discussed in a general context in Sec. II D.

A plot of these result with the same choice of parameters as for the triplet excitation is shown at the bottom of Fig. 1.
The Hubbard parameters used for the plots in Fig. 1 have been chosen such that the diﬀerences between the three ﬁrst
order approximations are large and become apparent. When the on–site repulsion term U is decreased in comparison to
the hopping parameter t, the RPA becomes stable and the diﬀerences between the discussed approximations diminish.
From Eq. (44) it can be seen that U is the source of ground state correlation in the model. Thus the present analysis
supports the ﬁndings of Sec. II D and leads to the conclusion that among the three considered approximations for
excitation energies only the FOSEP method includes ground state correlation in a consistent manner.

Of course, it is a special peculiarity of the present simple model that the FOSEP approximation already yields
the exact excitation energies. Certainly this model may seem inadequate to draw conclusions on the performance of
FOSEP for realistic large ﬁnite quantum systems which constitute the main area of possible applications. Therefore,
this model should not be understood as a test for large–scale numerical calculations but rather as the simplest possible
system where the eﬀect of ground state correlation could be investigated analytically.

particle–hole Green’s function [14]. The resulting approximations for excitation energies and transition moments prove
consistent in ﬁrst order but also higher order terms are present. Starting out from a Hartree–Fock single–particle
description, the FOSEP approximation yields a matrix eigenvalue problem of the same size as the well known Random
Phase Approximation (RPA). In contrast to the RPA, however, FOSEP presents a hermitian eigenvalue problem and
thus avoids the instabilities of the RPA. Although the FOSEP approximation has many properties in common with
the RPA, like size consistency and the invariance with respect to unitary transformations of the Hartree–Fock virtual
orbitals, there are also substantial diﬀerences. We have shown by a perturbation theoretical analysis up to second order
that the FOSEP approximation for the excitation energies consistently includes part of the ground state correlation
whereas the RPA proves inconsistent in this respect. This statement is supported by the results of a very simple
exactly solvable model. In the considered model the ground state is correlated whereas the approximated excited
states are not.
It turned out that the FOSEP approximation yields the exact results for the excitation energies
whereas the RPA does worse than the simpler Tamm–Dancoﬀ approximation (TDA). We also have addressed the
equivalence of length and velocity form of the transition moments. The exact preservation of this equivalence is a
very peculiar property of the RPA. Within the FOSEP approximation this equivalence is only preserved in ﬁrst order
which is consistent for a ﬁrst order scheme. The second order error encountered, however, may provide useful in
estimating the applicability of the approximation.

Future calculations on realistic systems still have to provide the ultimate test for the usefulness of the approximation
scheme presented here. From the present point of investigation the FOSEP method seems to have excellent prospects
to ﬁnd widespread application like, e. g., in clarifying the electronic structure of larger molecules especially when
ground state correlation is important. A possible line of extending the FOSEP method is to start out from a multi–
conﬁgurational self consistent ﬁeld (MC-SCF) reference state instead of the Hartree–Fock Slater determinant
.

This would allow for an adequate treatment of open–shell or other systems where strong ground state correlation
prohibits the zeroth order description by a Slater determinant. The ﬁrst order particle–hole self energy seems ideally
suited for such an extension since the primary matrices are deﬁned without reference to occupied or virtual Hartree–
Fock orbitals in contrast to the RPA or TDA. Thus the inclusion of multi–conﬁgurational reference states provides a
natural extension of the present theory. Straightforward approximations to the static particle–hole self energy can also
be obtained from a ground state description by density functional theory (DFT). While DFT has been very successful
in predicting ground state properties, the DFT description of excited states is a vivid and still open ﬁeld of current
interest [31,32,33,13]. The static particle–hole self energy seems well suited for adaption to DFT since it provides a
simple model for excitation properties that only requires a decent approximate description of one and two particle
densities in the ground state as input as discussed in the appendix. A direct formulation of the particle–hole self
energy in terms of density functionals, on the other hand, may as well lead to powerful approximations. Another open
point is the development of higher order approximations to the particle–hole self energy. This will allow to increase
the accuracy and lift the present restriction to particle–hole type excitations. A realisation of systematic higher order
approximations could follow the concepts of correlated excited states and intermediate state representations developed
in Refs. [18,19] and is left for future work.

Here
denotes the exact ground state of the system. In general, Eq. (A1) requires the evaluation of ground state
expectation values of one and two–particle operators. This is due to the particular combination of commutators and
anticommutators and to the fact that the Hamiltonian ˆH is a two–particle operator. But this means that the primary
block
and therefore the static particle–hole self energy can be calculated exactly if the general one and two–particle
densities of the ground state are known. Approximating the exact ground state
by a Slater determinant leads
to a factorisation of the two–particle densities and the ﬁrst order expression (12) is obtained. Other approximations
for the densities than those obtained by the Hartree–Hock Slater determinant are of course also possible. Density
functional theory, on the one hand, or a multi–conﬁgurational self consistent ﬁeld (MC–SCF) approximation for the
ground state wavefunction, on the other hand, provide interesting alternative approaches.

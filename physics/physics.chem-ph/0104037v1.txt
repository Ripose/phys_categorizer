Abstract

Scattering of ortho positronium (Ps) by cesium and rubidium atoms

has been investigated employing a three-Ps-state coupled-channel model

with Ps(1s,2s,2p) states using a time-reversal-symmetric regularized electron-

exchange model potential. We ﬁnd a narrow S-wave singlet resonance at 5.057

eV of width 0.003 eV in the Ps-Rb system and at 5.067 eV of width 0.003 eV

in the Ps-Cs system. Singlet P-wave resonances in both systems are found at

5.3 eV of width 0.4 eV. Singlet D-wave structures are found at 5.4 eV in both

systems. The pronounced P- and D-wave resonances in these systems lead

to easily detectable local minima in the low-energy elastic cross sections. We

also report results for elastic and Ps-excitation cross sections for Ps scattering

by Rb and Cs.

Recent measurements of ortho positronium (Ps) scattering cross section by H2, N2, He,

Ne, Ar, C4H10, and C5H12 [1–7] have initiated new theoretical investigations [8–14] in this

subject. We suggested [15–17] a regularized, symmetric, nonlocal electron-exchange model

potential and used it in the study of Ps scattering by H [18], He [16,17,19], Ne [19], Ar [19],

H2 [20], Li [21], Na [22] and K [22]. The low-energy cross sections obtained in these studies

are in agreement with experimental measurements for He [3,4] , Ne [7], Ar [7] and H2 [3,4].

These investigations also produced correct results for resonance and binding energies for

the S wave electronic singlet state of Ps-H [9–12,18] and Ps-Li [21] systems in addition to

experimental pick-oﬀ quenching rate in Ps-He [17] scattering. These studies also predicted

low-energy resonances in lower partial waves of the Ps-Na and Ps-K systems [22].

In this Letter we apply the above symmetric model-exchange potential to study Ps-Rb

and Ps-Cs scattering using the three-Ps-state coupled-channel method. The interaction

in the singlet channel is attractive in nature as in the corresponding channel of the Ps-H

system [18] and we ﬁnd resonances in this channel at low energies in S, P and D waves of

both systems near the Ps(2) excitation threshold. We also report angle-integrated elastic

and Ps-excitation cross sections for both systems.

The resonances in electron-atom [23–25] and positron-atom [26] systems, and in other

atomic systems in general, are of great interest. Several resonances in the electron-hydrogen

system have been found in the close-coupling calculation and later reconﬁrmed in the varia-

tional calculation [27–29]. Resonances have also been found in the close-coupling calculation

of electron scattering by Li, Na and K [30,31]. These resonances provide the necessary test-

ing ground for a theoretical formulation and can eventually be detected experimentally. A

proper dynamical description of scattering in a theoretical formulation is necessary for the

appearance of these resonances. The ability of the present exchange potential to reproduce

the resonances in diverse Ps-atom systems [18,21,22] assures its realistic nature.

For target-elastic scattering we solve the following Lippmann-Schwinger scattering inte-

gral equation in momentum space [16,18]

and the f ± are the singlet and triplet scattering amplitudes, respectively. The quantum
states are labeled by the indices ν, referring to the Ps atom. The variables k, k′, k′′ etc

denote the appropriate momentum states of Ps; kν′′ is the on-shell relative momentum of
Ps in the channel ν′′. We use units ¯h = m = 1 where m is the electron mass.

To avoid the complication of calculating exchange potential with a many-electron wave

function, we consider a frozen-core one-valence-electron approximation for the targets Rb

and Cs. Such wave functions have been successfully used for scattering of alkali metal atoms

in other contexts and also for positronium scattering by Li [13,14]. The Rb(5s) and Cs(6s)

frozen-core hydrogen-atom-like wave functions are taken as

where ρ = 2rα with α = 1/(n¯a0). Here n = 5 for Rb and = 6 for Cs and ¯a0 = (2n2Ei)−1a0
with Ei the ionization energy of the target in atomic unit and a0 the Bohr radius of H. Here

we use the following experimental values for ionization energies for Rb and Cs, respectively:

4.176 eV and 3.893 eV [32].

In this coupled-channel calculation we employ the above frozen-core approximation for

the target wave function. In addition we shall neglect the excited states of the target and

employ only the lowest Ps(2) excitations of the Ps. Although, such an approximation is

not entirely realistic, specially when these excitations are energetically open, it makes this

complicated scattering process mathematically tractable. Moreover, previous experience

with Ps-Li, Ps-Na, and Ps-K systems in similar three-Ps-state model has revealed interesting

physics in producing resonances and correct binding energies [21,22]. The reproduction of

correct binding energies assures of physically plausible low-energy cross sections. Hence

we believe that the present study of Ps-Rb and Ps-Cs scattering should lead to physically

reasonable results. However, it would be interesting to repeat this investigation in the future

including the excited states of the target, as has been by Ray in the Ps-Li system [14], as well

as of Ps, and compare the results for low-energy scattering with the present investigation.

The exchange potential for Ps scattering is considered [15] to be a generalization of the

kf , and β2

−

Ochkur-Rudge exchange potential for electron scattering [33,34]. It is possible to introduce

an adjustable parameter in the above exchange potential to ﬁt the scattering result to an

accurately known low-energy observable, such as the Ps-atom scattering length or binding

energy [19]. However, in Ps-Rb and Ps-Cs systems there is no such observable and we use

the parameter-free exchange amplitude (5) in this investigation.

After a partial-wave projection, the system of coupled equations (1) is solved by the

method of matrix inversion. Forty Gauss-Legendre quadrature points are used in the dis-

cretization of each momentum-space integral. The calculation is performed with the exact

Ps wave functions and frozen-core orbitals (2) and (3) for Rb(5s) and Cs(6s) ground state.

We consider Ps-Rb and Ps-Cs scattering using the three-Ps-state model that includes the fol-

lowing states: Ps(1s)Rb(5s), Ps(2s)Rb(5s), Ps(2p)Rb(5s), and Ps(1s)Cs(6s), Ps(2s)Cs(6s),

Ps(2p)Cs(6s), for Rb and Cs, respectively.

The Ps-Rb and Ps-Cs systems have an eﬀective attractive interaction in the singlet

channel as in the Ps-H [18] and Ps-Li [21] systems. The targets of these systems have one

active valence electron outside a closed shell.

In the coupled-channel calculation we ﬁnd

resonances in both systems in the singlet state. No resonances appear in the triplet state.

For the resonances to appear, the inclusion of the excited states of Ps is fundamental in a

coupled-channel calculation. The static-exchange model with both the target and Ps in the

ground state does not lead to these resonances. A detailed investigation of these resonances

in coupled-channel model of Ps-H [9–11,18] and Ps-Li [21] systems in the singlet state has

appeared in the literature.

4

Here to study the resonances, ﬁrst we calculate the S-, P- and D-wave elastic phase shifts

and cross sections in the singlet channel of the Ps-Rb and Ps-Cs systems using the 3-Ps-

state model. The phase shifts are calculated in the usual fashion [35] from the partial-wave

scattering amplitude or from the partial-wave S matrix. The energy and width of resonance

are obtained by ﬁtting the corresponding partial-wave cross section to the well-known Breit-

Wigner formula

where σ(E) is the cross section at energy E = 6.8k2 eV, ER is the resonance energy and Γ

the width. The S-wave phase shifts are shown in Fig. 1. The Ps-Rb system has a resonance

at 5.057 eV of width 0.003 eV. The resonance in the Ps-Cs system appears at 5.067 eV and

also has a width 0.003 eV. The phase shift curves in Fig. 1 clearly show the resonances

where the phase shifts jump by π.

In Fig. 2 we show the P-wave Ps-Rb and Ps-Cs phase shifts in the singlet state. Both

systems possess resonances at 5.2 eV of width of 0.3 eV. The P-wave singlet elastic cross

section at low energies shown in the oﬀ-set clearly exhibits these resonances. In Fig. 3 we

plot the D-wave singlet elastic cross section for Ps-Rb and Ps-Cs systems at low energies.

There is a structure in both systems at 5.4 eV which is more diﬀuse than in S and P waves.

Next we calculate the diﬀerent partial cross sections of Ps-Rb and Ps-Cs scattering. The

convergence of the cross sections with respect to partial waves is slower in this case than in

the case of Ps-H scattering. At a incident Ps energy of 50 eV, 40 partial waves were used

to achieve convergence of the partial-wave scheme. In Figs. 4 and 5 we plot diﬀerent angle-

integrated cross sections of Ps-Rb and Ps-Cs scattering, respectively. Speciﬁcally, we plot

the elastic, Ps(2s) and Ps(2p) excitation cross sections using the three-Ps-state model. For

comparison we also plot the elastic cross section obtained with the static-exchange model.

The elastic cross section is large at low energies in both systems. In the oﬀ-set of Figs. 4

and 5 we plot the corresponding low-energy elastic cross sections. The eﬀect of the inclusion

of highly polarizable Ps(2) states in the coupling scheme could be considerable, specially at

low energies.

From Figs. 4 and 5 we see that the P and D-wave resonances of large widths predicted

in this Letter have lead to local minima in the elastic cross section below the Ps excitation

threshold at 5.1 eV. Hence these resonances can be easily detected experimentally after an

5

analysis of the elastic scattering cross section at low energies. This makes these resonances

of great experimental interest. Similar minima appear in the cross section for electron

scattering by alkali-metal atoms due to appearance of resonances in these systems [19,31].

However, the S-wave resonances in the Ps-Rb and Ps-Cs systems are narrow and may not

be easily noted experimentally from a simple analysis of the cross sections.

To summarize, we have performed a three-Ps-state coupled-channel calculation of Ps-

Rb and Ps-Cs scattering at low energies using a regularized symmetric nonlocal electron-

exchange model potential [15,16] successfully used [16,18–21] previously in diﬀerent Ps scat-

tering problems. We present the results of angle-integrated partial cross sections at diﬀerent

Ps energies. We also present results for singlet phase shifts and partial-wave cross sections

at low energies to study the resonances in these systems. We ﬁnd resonances in S, P and

D waves near the Ps(2) excitation threshold. In this Letter we have used a three-Ps-state

model. Similar resonances have been found in the coupled-channel model of electron-H

[27–29], electron-Na, electron-K [30,31], positron-hydrogen [26], Ps-H [10,11,18] and Ps-Li

[21] systems. In most cases, a more complete calculation and (in some cases) experiments

have reconﬁrmed these resonances. In view of this we do not believe that the appearance of

these resonances in the present three-state calculation to be so peculiar as to have no general

validity. However, the resonance energies might change slightly after a more complete cal-

culation as in electron-H, positron-H and Ps-H systems and it would be intersting to study

the present resonances using more complete theoretical models in the future in addition to

compare the present results with future experiments.

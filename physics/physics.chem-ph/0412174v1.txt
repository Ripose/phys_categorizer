Abstract

In this paper, we propose a generic and systematic approach for
In partic-
study of the electronic structure for atoms or molecules.
ular, we address the issue of single particle states, or orbitals, which
should be one of the most important aspects of a quantum many-body
theory. We argue that the single-particle Green function provides a
most general scheme for generating these single particle states or or-
bitals. We call them the correlated atomic or molecular orbitals to
make a distinction from those determined from Hartree − Fock equa-
tion. We present the calculation of the single particle properties (i.e.,
the electron aﬃnities (EA′s) and ionization potentials (IP ′s)) for the
H2O molecule using the correlated molecular orbitals in the context of
quantum chemistry with a second-order self energy. We also calculate
the total ground state energy with a single Slater wavefunction deter-
mined only from the hole states. Comparisons are made with available
experimental data as well as with those from the Hartree − Fock or
density functional theory (DF T ) calculations. We conclude that the
correlated atomic or molecular orbital approach provides a strictest
and most powerful method for studying the single-particle properties
of atoms or molecules. It also gives a better total energy than do the
Hartree − Fock and DFT even at the single Slater determinant level.

vantages and also overcomes their shortcomings of current quantum
chemistry methods based on either the conventional quantum many-
body theory or the DF T .

1 Introduction

The single particle approximation, or the concept of atomic or molecular

orbitals in the context of quantum chemistry, is a natural and almost a nec-

essary scenario for solving an interacting many-electron system for atoms,

molecules, or solids [1]. This is a reﬂection of not only a physical existence

but also possibly a mathematical reality. The usual equation which is being

used to determine the orbitals is the Hartree − Fock equation [2, 3]. The

rest of endeavor to remedy the approximation resulting from a replacement

of the whole many-body wavefunction by a single determinant used in the

HF scheme is called the correlation issue. This is a most diﬃcult problem

and constitutes the major activity of researches for the quantum chemistry

community in the last 50 years [4]. According to the energy scale principle we

described in paper [5], the Hartree − Fock scheme should be a good approxi-

mation when the single determinant wavefunction dominates and there is no

any signiﬁcant mixing with the nearby conﬁgurations. This is typically the

case when we compute the energetics for molecules with a stable geometric

structure. The subsequent perturbation correction for the correlation such

as MPPT is also proved to be powerful [6]. However, there are the situations

when the conﬁguration mixing is a prominent or dominant phenomenon, and

2

the description with more than one single conﬁguration seems necessary. This

includes the calculation of transition states or excited states, and for open-

shell molecules, etc. The computation based on the Hartree − Fock equation

has shown to be insuﬃcient, and the corresponding perturbation correction

has proved not to be convergent [7, 8, 9]. The MCSCF approaches have

been introduced to investigate this type of nondynamic or static correlation

issue, and they have become one of the most popular approaches for the

study of molecular electron correlation [5, 10, 11, 12]. However, the size of

molecular systems that this type of approaches can address are still limited

because of the diﬃculties in selecting the appropriate conﬁguration states

and in achieving the convergence to the correct state of the interest [12].

Another important and signiﬁcant advance in the ﬁelds of electron correla-

tion is the development of density function theory (DFT ) [13, 14]. Instead

of working with a multi-conﬁgurational framework, it intents to incorporate

the exchange-correlation eﬀect into a single-particle potential formalism. It

has already shown its very usefulness in the study of the electronic structure

for large systems with utilization of relatively smaller computational eﬀorts.

Nevertheless, there exist some serious drawbacks for the method when seen

either from theoretical consideration or from the practical performance in

calculation. One shortcoming is that the theory can only study the ground

state problem, and cannot treat the same eigenstate problem for excited

states within one theoretical framework. Another serious problem is that the

actual form for the exchange-correlation is unknown, or the theory itself gives

no clue for how to approach it. Moreover, the approach fails to or can not do

the accurate computation for the points or situations when the conﬁguration

3

mixing is important [15, 16, 17]. Indeed, it should be a very diﬃcult thing,

intending to replace the intrinsic many-body eﬀects such as static correlation

or conﬁguration mixing with a single-particle formalism.

Recently, we have demonstrated that a general quantum many-body per-

turbation theory can not only be used for understanding the various elec-

tronic phenomena including the nature of chemical bonds but also serve as a

uniﬁed theme for constructing general electronic structure theories and cal-

culation schemes. This also includes the study of important issues of electron

correlation [5]. This pinpoints the direction and paves the way for the fu-

ture investigation.

In this paper, we add another important ingredient to

the ﬁeld of electron correlation or electronic structure theory in general. We

emphasize our investigation on the issue of single particle approximation,

or the atomic or molecular orbitals for the quantum chemistry calculation.

From the perturbation point of view, this corresponds to deﬁning a refer-

ence Hamiltonian [5, 18]. We will show that there exists a strict theoretical

formalism, called the single-particle Green function, which provides a most

general scheme for generating or determining these single-particle states up

to present time. The theory of single-particle Green function has been de-

veloped for a long time and used in many diﬀerent ways but its full physical

meaning or context is not totally understood or appreciated. This paper aims

at a beginning for a systematic investigation of electron correlation based on

the single-particle Green function formalism and within the quantum many-

body perturbation theory [5]. In the next Section, we present its deﬁnitions

and equations in both time and energy domains. In particular, we give an

energy eigenequation that solves the single-particle states. We analyze its

4

intrinsic structure and compare it with other methods. In Section 3, we cal-

culate both the single-particle properties and the total energies for the H2O

molecule using the Hartree − Fock, DFT , and correlated molecular orbital

approaches. In the ﬁnal Section, we analyze and discuss our results for the

calculations and also do the comparison with each other including the corre-

sponding experimental data. We also propose a generic electronic structure

theory and outline the future research.

The wavefunctions |Ψn(N ±1)i and energy levels En(N ±1) are for the N ±1

electronic systems. The functions {φn(~x)} are the ones of single-particle

coordinates, and are called the particle states for those deﬁned by Eq. (6)

(ǫn ≥ µ), and the hole states for those deﬁned by Eq. (7) (ǫn < µ), where

µ is the chemical potential. The corresponding energy ǫn are the electron

aﬃnity or the electron ionization potential, respectively. A very important

feature of these single-particle states {φn(~x)} is that they form a complete

set as shown below,

where the operator Σ(~x, ~x

local and energy dependent. From this equation for the single-particle Green

function and its Lehmann representation (5), we can get an equation that

the single-particle states {φn(~x)} satisfy

(13)

in a more general Dirac notation.

It is called the Dyson equation or the

energy eigenequation for the quasi-particles in the current literature [20, 21,

22, 23]. When we do the comparison with the Hartree − Fock equation or

the Kohn − Sham equation [2, 3, 13], it seems that the self-energy operator

Σ is related to the exchange and correlation eﬀects of an interacting many-

electron system beyond that of the classical Coulomb interaction. Unlike

the Kohn − Sham equation, however, where the explicit analytical potential

for the exchange-correlation potential is unknown, the self-energy operator

has intrinsic structure, and, for example, can be expanded as a perturbation

series as follows,

Σ = Σ(0) + Σ(1) + ... + Σ(n) + ....

(14)

7

They have explicit physical interpretations and therefore can be approached

in a systematic way [20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29]. Another important

feature of Eq. (12) is that the single-particle states are deﬁned for both hole

state (Eq. (6)) and particle states (Eq. (7)), and therefore there exists the

concept of a fundamental excitation in the present formalism. In other words,

we can form the conﬁgurations based on these single particle states. Further-

more, since they constitute a complete set of single-particle states, as shown

in Eq.(8), any N-electron wavefunctions can be expanded as a linear combi-

nation of these conﬁgurations. For these reasons, we can regard the equation

(12) as a most general eigenequation for creating the single-particle states

or the atomic or molecular orbitals at present time. It is the corresponding

one-particle description of an N interacting many-body system [30]. For

clearness and easiness to be understood, we call the single-particle states

determined by Eq.

(12) as the correlated atomic or molecular orbitals in

order to make a distinction from those determined from the Hartree − Fock

equation. Obviously, they will catch the full Hamiltonian (2) more than do

the Hartree − Fock orbitals.

The successfulness for obtaining the most appropriate correlated atomic

or molecular orbitals {φn(~x)} will depend on how well we can obtain the

correct self-energy operator Σ. This will in turn depend on what kind of

wavefunctions or what level of theories we select as the reference or the ini-

tial wavefunction for our construction of Σ since the Eq. (12) is an iterative

equation for determination of {ǫn} and {φn(~x)}. Obviously, there will be dif-

ferent choices for diﬀerent species or for diﬀerent molecular geometries being

studied as have already been demonstrated in many existing quantum chem-

8

istry calculations. Several types of perturbation schemes for the self-energy

operator have already been developed either from solid state physics com-

munity or by quantum chemists [20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29]. These

include the functional derivative method [20, 21, 22, 23], the superoperator

formalism [24, 25, 26, 27], the diagrammatic expansion method [28], and the

equation of motion approach [29].

3 Calculation and Results

In this section, we present the computation of the single-particle properties

and total energies for H2O molecule. We employ the Hartree − Fock method,

DFT , and correlated molecular orbital approach we describe above for the

calculation and do the corresponding comparison.

The geometric parameters for the water molecule are taken from experi-
mental observation which are R(O−H) = 0.957 ˙A, and 6 HOH = 104.5(deg) [31].

For the Hartree − Fock calculation, we use the cc − pVTZ basis set [32]. The

calculated energies for the ﬁrst ten molecular orbitals are listed in the second

column of Table 1. The computed total energy is shown in the Table 2. For

the DFT calculation, we use the same set of basis functions. The exchange-

correlation functional is approximated with the B3LYP scheme [33, 34]. The

result for the ﬁrst ten Kohn − Sham orbital energies is listed in the third

column of the Table 1. The total energy is shown in the Table 2. For the

computation based on the correlated molecular orbitals, we take the second-

9

order approximation for the self-energy operator,

Σij(E) = Σ(1)

ij (E) + Σ(2)

ij (E).

(15)

The detailed forms for the self-energy operator with diﬀerent orders are

dependent upon the reference states chosen [21, 35]. For the closed-shell

molecules, if we pick the Hartree − Fock orbitals as the reference states,

the ﬁrst-order self energy vanishes, and the second-order self-energy is given

by [18]

Σ(2)

ij (E) =

N/2

Xars

hrs|iai (2hja|rsi − haj|rsi)
E + ǫa − ǫr − ǫs

+

hab|iri (2hjr|abi − hrj|abi)
E + ǫr − ǫa − ǫb

N/2

Xabr

(16)

where a, b, ... are the spatial hole states, and r, s, ... are the spatial parti-

cle states. If we choose the Kohn − Sham orbitals as the reference states,

however, the ﬁrst-order self-energy takes the form

Σ(1)

ij (E) = −hi|Vxc|ji −

hia|aji,

(17)

N

Xa

and the second-order self-energy remains the same as that for the case of

the Hartree − Fock orbitals. We solve the eigenequation (12) for the quasi-

particles with the cc − pVTZ basis set. When the Hartree − Fock orbitals

are used as the reference state, the calculated quasienergies for the ﬁrst ten

correlated molecular orbitals are shown in the third column of the Table 1.

The resulting total energy with the single determinant using the ﬁrst ﬁve

doubly-occupied hole states is also listed in the table 2. When the DFT

determinant is employed as the reference state, the corresponding results are

listed in the forth column of table 1 or table 2. All the computations are

done with the Hondo − v99 .6 suite [36].

4 Discussion and Conclusions

In this paper, we present a novel approach for the study of electronic structure

of atoms and molecules related to the single-particle Green function theory.

We argue that the single-particle Green function provides a most general

theoretical framework for generating the atomic or molecular orbitals for the

atoms and molecules. Based on this statement, we have calculated both

the energies of these single-particle states and total energies for the H2O

molecule [37, 38, 39]. For the total energy, a single-determinant wavefunction

composed of hole states only is used for the computation. At the same

time, the calculations are also performed with the Hartree − Fock and DFT

methods.

When compared with the experimental ionization energy or electron aﬃn-

ity for H2O molecule [40], we see that the correlated molecular orbitals with

the Hartree − Fock orbitals as the reference state gives the better results

than the ones from the Hartree − Fock or DFT methods. The total energies

obtained with three diﬀerent methods are also compared to the one obtained

from the experimental observation [31, 37, 38, 39]. The correlated molecular

orbital approach results in the best value. Of course, the calculation can be

further improved by choosing the DFT as a reference wavefunction. We have

the similar conclusion.

Since the work of Heitler and London in the calculation of the electronic

structure for H2 molecule, which is the indication of the beginning of the ﬁeld

of quantum chemistry, it has the history of development for more than eighty

years. However, there is a fundamental issue, i.e., the quality of atomic or

molecular orbitals, which has been neglected for a long time. This paper

11

addresses this ”quality” issue for single-particle states or orbitals in many-

body theory. From the perturbation theory point of view, this corresponds to

a deﬁnition of the reference Hamiltonian, which is crucial in the minimization

of dynamic correlation energy or convergence of perturbation series.

It is

also critical in providing the best single particle properties. Both of the

calculated single-particle properties and total energies have explicit physical

interpretation and are subject to the test from experimental observations [41].

From above analysis, it is obvious that when the concept of correlated

atom or molecular orbital is incorporated into the quantum many-body per-

turbation or coupled cluster theory, it will provide a most powerful quan-

tum many-body approach for the study of electronic structure of atoms or

molecules. On one hand, its single-particle properties have obvious physi-

cal meanings which is in contrast to the case for the DFT . Furthermore, it

can go beyond the single-determinant level and form conﬁgurations. There-

fore, it can study the issues when conﬁguration mixing is important. On the

other hand, when doing the comparison to the traditional quantum many-

body theory based on the Hartree − Fock or MCSCF orbitals, the correlated

orbital method not only has provided a better description of single-particle

properties, but also gives us the better convergence at the conﬁguration level

and therefore provides a more powerful computational scheme. For these

reasons, we could claim that the correlated atomic or molecular approach

will be a most general ab initio correlation method for electron structure cal-

culations. It possesses the advantages and also overcomes their shortcomings

of current DFT and conventional correlation approaches based on the atomic

or molecular orbitals determined from the Hartree − Fock or MCSCF .

12

Of course, it has been a very diﬃcult task for a long time to get the ap-

proximate self-energy operator to the higher orders. However, the intrinsic

structure such as its perturbation series expansion has oﬀered us a possi-

bility instead of an outside model for the approximation. Furthermore, the

further study of this underlying intrinsic structure will tell us more universal

things which might be true even for a many-body theory or system in gen-

eral. Henceforth, the continuing investigation of the higher order self-energy

operators and their relations will be a rewarding research [42].

An interesting point needed to be mentioned is that the self-energy oper-

ator in Eq. (12) does not have to be Hermitian which corresponds to the sit-

uation when ψn(~x) is a real orbital. Here the imaginary case for the operator

is related to the electron dynamics which is left as a future investigation [20]

Finally, if we fully explore the usefulness of the pseudopotential theory,

combined QM /MM approach, or linear scaling algorithms and so forth, the

correlation theory based on the correlated atomic or molecular orbitals will

provide to us a most robust approach for the study of electronic structure

even for large systems [5].

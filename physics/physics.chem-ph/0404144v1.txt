In a recent study by Kornath et al.

[J. Chem. Phys. 118, 6957 (2003)], the Lin clusters
with n = 2, 4 and 8 have been isolated in argon matrices at 15 K and characterized by Raman
spectroscopy. This has prompted us to carry out a theoretical study on such clusters up to n = 10,
using Hartree-Fock theory, plus low-order Møller-Plesset perturbation corrections. To check against
the above study of Kornath et al., as a by-product we have made the same approximations for
n = 6 and 8 as we have for n = 10. This has led us to emphasize trends with n through the Lin
clusters for (i) ground-state energy, (ii) HOMO-LUMO energy gap, (iii) dissociation energy, and (iv)
Hartree-Fock eigenvalue sum. The role of electron correlation in distinguishing between low-lying
isomers is plainly crucial, and will need a combination of experiment and theory to obtain decisive
results such as that of Kornath et al. for Li8. In particular, it is shown that Hartree-Fock theory
plus bond order correlations does account for the experimentally observed symmetry Td symmetry
for Li8.

I. BACKGROUND AND OUTLINE

suggestions for future work are covered in Section V.

Lithium clusters by now have been studied by a variety
of experimental techniques which include electron spin
resonance,
laser induced ﬂuorescence, depletion spec-
troscopy, photoionization, and Raman spectroscopy1.
This Ref. 1 has investigated, in particular, the lithium
clusters Lin, for n = 2, 4 and 8. This has been done
by isolating these clusters in argon matrices at 15 K.
Whereas Kornath et al.1 point out that most of the tech-
niques listed above are diﬃcult to correlate with the clus-
ter geometries, their experimental work was able to de-
termine the geometry of Li4 as a rhombic structure (D2h)
and for Li8 a hypertetrahedral structure (Td) was shown
to be in agreement with their Raman studies.

This experimental work has motivated the present the-
oretical study of Lin clusters. Most attention is focussed
here on n = 10, but we have also included n = 6 and
n = 8. In the latter case, we must mention the previ-
ous theoretical work of Bonacic-Koutecky, Fantucci and
Koutecky2.

The outline of the paper is then as follows.

In Sec-
tion II some general trends of the electronic structure of
Lin clusters are depicted with n ranging from 1 to 10.
We note that Kornath et al.1 studied n = 2, 4, and 8
extensively using high quality techniques. For Li8 our
more modest techniques essentially conﬁrmed the ﬁnd-
ings of Kornath et al.1 for the equilibrium geometry and
the vibrational frequencies. So we focus in Section III
dominantly on Li6. Section IV presents results for Li10.
Finally, discussion of some additional trends, plus some

II. QUANTUM CHEMICALLY PREDICTED
TRENDS IN Lin CLUSTERS FOR n = 1 TO 10

In this Section we present our results of the calcula-
tions made on Lin clusters (n = 2, 4, 6, 8, 10), by using the
Gaussian package (G03 Linux version)3. All the calcula-
tions were performed using the standard self-consistent
ﬁeld Hartree-Fock (HF) theory with the 6-311G∗ basis
set. The correlation energy was obtained using low-order
Møller-Plesset (MP2) corrections4, considering all (va-
lence and core) electrons. For both HF and HF+MP2
level, full geometry optimization and vibrational analy-
sis were performed for all Li clusters.

While Sections III and IV will develop further the sys-
tematic studies we have made especially for n = 6 and
10, with the approximate quantum chemical approach set
out above, this Section will present the general trends
predicted by HF+MP2 theory for n = 1 to 10.

To this end, Fig. 1 depicts the ground-state energy
per atom for increasing n from 1 to 10. No commen-
tary is needed on the results for n = 1 − 4, except to
show as an inset the accepted planar structure of Li4.
The HF energy of this cluster is −29.759 and the lower-
ing by second-order Møller-Plesset perturbation theory
yields −29.859, both in Hartrees (as all energies below,
unless stated otherwise).

As seen in Fig. 1, two structures were found to be
low-lying isomers of Li6, with symmetries D4h and D3h,

FIG. 1: Ground-state energy per atom of Lin clusters, with
n = 1 − 10. Inset: accepted D2h planar structure of Li4.

to consider our detailed results for Li6 and, quite brieﬂy,
also Li8 in Section III immediately below.

and these will be discussed in detail in Section III below.
Likewise, for Li8, Cs and Td structures emerge and again
Section III presents details. Li10 has the lowest MP2
energy per atom of the clusters considered and is the
subject of Section IV.

Again concerning general trends, Fig. 2 shows the vari-
ation of the HOMO-LUMO gap for Lin clusters with the
number of atoms n in the lithium cluster.
It is of in-
terest to note that though the variation is irregular for
n = 4 − 8, the smallest gap is at n = 10. It is relevant
to add here that solid lithium is metallic, with therefore
zero energy gap. Of course the gap at n = 10 is still
∼ 5 eV! It is the trend, not the absolute numbers, which
should be the focus here.

With this relatively brief discussion of trends we turn

with D3h symmetry. Right: Most stable isomer predicted by
HF+MP2, with D4h symmetry, and a dimer-like Li2 structure
perpendicular to the plane.

III. GEOMETRY, ENERGY, AND
VIBRATIONAL FREQUENCIES OF Li6 AND Li8
USING HF+MP2 THEORY

In Ref. 1, a comment was made in their experimental
considerations of a result which ‘may indirectly support
the absence of a Li6 species.’ Motivated by this, we have,
by geometry optimization, ‘converged’ on the geometries
of two low-lying isomers which are depicted in Fig. 3.
The ﬁrst of these is the planar structure (Fig. 3, left),
with HF energy −44.658 and with addition of MP2 is
−44.810. The present HF+MP2 approach, however, pre-
dicts as the isomer we identify as the ground state, the
planar square with a ‘diatomic’ Li2-like species perpen-
dicular to the plane, through the center of gravity. While
this has a (very) slightly higher HF energy than the pla-
nar structure, it lies below that structure energetically
when ‘correlation’ treated at the MP2 level is added, the
results being EHF = −44.655 and with the MP2 correc-
tion −44.824.

Turning quite brieﬂy to Li8, the geometry was settled
as Td from the Raman studies of Ref. 1, whereas as can
be seen from Fig. 1, the Cs symmetry is predicted as
very slightly lower by our present approximation. This is
enough to illustrate the stringent test of many-electron
approximate theories that is aﬀorded by attempts to pre-
dict decisively the ground-state energies of isomers of Lin
clusters. However, the vibrational frequencies of Li8 (Td)
are more in line with the observed values than those of
the Cs structure, which is somewhat encouraging in the
light of the known geometry (Td) of the lowest lying iso-
mer.

We turn next to discuss, with fuller details, the Li10

cluster.

FIG. 4: Low-lying isomers of Li10. Left: Asymmetric isomer.
Right: Symmetric (D2d) isomer. The D2d isomer of Li10 is
characterized by reﬂection symmetry with respect to the plane

rotation symmetry with
respect to the C2 axis. See also5 for calculated properties of
both isomers.

IV. GEOMETRY, ENERGY, AND
VIBRATIONAL FREQUENCIES OF TWO
LOW-LYING ISOMERS OF Li10

We have carried out similar calculations which have led
us to two geometries of Li10 which appear to be serious
candidates for low-lying isomers. The ﬁrst of these is
the very asymmetrical structure shown in Fig. 4 (left).
Here, with an atom, roughly speaking, at the ‘center’
of the cluster, there can, of course, be no symmetrical
arrangement around it.

We have evaluated the total energies, the distance ma-
trix (in ˚A) and the calculated frequencies (in cm−1) of
the geometrical structure shown in Fig. 4 (left)5. The
second structure we found as a low-lying isomer is shown
in Fig. 4 (right)5. This second isomer is characterized
by D2d symmetry, and may be thought as obtained from
the Li8 cluster, by ‘adding’ two more Li atoms (with,
of course, diﬀerent bond lengths and angles), shown in
Fig. 4 (right) in the top-right-hand and bottom-left-hand
positions.

V. DISCUSSION AND SOME FUTURE
DIRECTIONS

Let us begin this discussion of the results presented
above by dealing ﬁrst with further trends, to add to those
reported in Section II.

A. Sum of eigenvalues (Esn) related to total energy
En, for n atom cluster

In Fig. 5 we have plotted for n = 2 to 10 the total
energies En versus the eigenvalue sum Esn from the HF
occupied eigenvalues ǫin, deﬁned by

Esn =

ǫin.

Xoccupied i

FIG. 5: Total energies En versus eigenvalue sum Esn of Lin
(n = 2 − 10). The straight line is Eq. (2)6.

We ﬁnd an approximately linear relation, which is
compared with a theoretical prediction from initially
Thomas-Fermi statistical theory, given by March and
Plaskett6 for neutral atoms:

E =

Es.

The result (2) was found, independently, by Ruedenberg7
from self-consistent ﬁeld results for molecules, and its
foundation in density functional theory was subsequently
discussed by one of us8.

B. Trends in dissociation energy Dn with number
of atoms n in Lin clusters deﬁned as |En − nE1|

As a further trend through the clusters Lin with n go-
ing from 2 to 10, we have collected in Table I results
from our HF+MP2 calculations for the dissociation en-
ergy Dn.

Mucci and March9, in early work, stressed the merit of
Teller’s theorem10, which states that molecules/clusters
do not bind in any wholly local density approximation
(LDA). To avoid confusion with current terminology,
‘wholly LDA’ in Teller’s theorem refers to also treating
the kinetic energy T by the Thomas-Fermi (TF) result

TTF = ck

where ρ(r) denotes
the
molecule/cluster.
If T denotes the correct (single-
particle) kinetic energy at the equilibrium geometry,
Mucci and March9 pointed out that the diﬀerence be-
tween T and TTF was entirely due to electron density
gradients, e.g. ∇ρ, ∇2ρ, etc.

4

HF − T (n)

characterizing Dn/N 2. Therefore, in Fig. 6 we have made
a further plot of Dn/N 2 already given in Table I, versus
|T (n)
TF |, the latter quantity being expected to re-
ﬂect T (n)
vW, albeit approximately. There is a quite clear
correlation from Fig. 6 between D/N 2 and the ‘gradient
diﬀerence’ THF − TTF, substantiating the work reported
in Refs. 9,11,12.

C. Comments on individual clusters and especially
role of electron correlation

In cases when n = 6 and 8, two low-lying isomers have
emerged from our studies using the HF+MP2 approxi-
mation. A strong pointer to the importance of electron
correlation in any quite decisive prediction of the true
ground-state geometry is aﬀorded by the two structures,
considered for Li8, where Kornath et al.1 have experimen-
tally veriﬁed from their Raman studies that the correct
structure is Td. This is indeed predicted to be lower in
energy than Cs in our HF studies, but the situation is
(wrongly!) changed over by treating electron correlation
at MP2 level. However, as noted, HF+MP2 vibrational
frequencies are considerably higher for Td than for Cs,
the latter clearly being in marked disagreement with ex-
periment! On the other hand, a comparison of HF+MP2
energies and HF energy plus bond-order correlation en-
ergy (Sec. V D) shows that indeed inclusion of bond-order
correlation allows to conﬁrm the experimentally observed
Td structure for Li8.

Turning more brieﬂy to Li6, we ﬁnd two low-lying iso-
mers, both with lower energies than either 6 isolated Li
atoms or 3 isolated Li2 molecules. Also stability with re-
spect to isolated Li4 and Li2 components is clear. Again,
however, while D4h lies higher in energy than D3h at the
HF level of approximation, including electron correlation
at order MP2 reverses the ordering. Our conclusion here
then which seems to us ﬁrm is that two low lying isomers
of Li6 are found. However, the energy ordering is not de-
cisive, though our prejudice here is in favor of the MP2
addition, namely D4h symmetry, but that must remain
conjecture until electron correlation is treated by more
reﬁned approaches such as the coupled cluster approxi-
mation. Finally, the largest cluster studied here seems
fairly ‘strongly’ bound, being stable again with respect
to 10 Li atoms, 5 Li2 dimers, and also the isolated ‘frag-
ments’ Li6 + Li4 and Li8 + Li2. None of this must be
taken to mean that our structure for Li10 is the lowest-
lying isomer of this cluster, though that is our prediction
at the HF+MP2 level.

In the light of the importance of electron correlation,
we shall now present some ‘heuristic’ ideas on this sub-
ject, in which appeal will be made to bond-order ver-
sus bond-length relations which we have used earlier for
polyatomic molecules13. We note here that the study of
Kornath et al.1 already includes extensive and careful ab
initio MO calculations with high level of treatment of
electronic correlations.

FIG. 6: Dissociation energy Dn/N 2, where N is the total
number of electrons in cluster for Lin, versus HF kinetic en-
HF minus Thomas-Fermi kinetic energy T (n)
ergy T (n)
TF .

This idea was followed up by Allan et al.11, who showed
that D/N 2, with N the total number of electrons in the
molecule, indeed correlated with the simplest energy con-
structed from ∇ρ, namely the von Weizs¨acker (vW) in-
homogeneity kinetic energy deﬁned by

TvW =

1
8 Z

(∇ρ)2
ρ

dr.

(4)

This is the ﬁrst-order correction due to density gradients
in the diﬀerence T − TTF. Therefore, in Fig. 6 we have
plotted Dn/N 2, already recorded in Table I, versus T (n)
HF −
T (n)
TF (where T (n)
HF at equilibrium from the virial
theorem) for the series Lin, with n again running from 2
to 10.

HF = −E(n)

Subsequently, one of us12 has given the inhomogeneous
electron gas theory of molecular dissociation energies.
This reveals that T 1/6
vW is the crucial variable to use in

One can utilize, for example, the recent study of Alonso
et al.17 to estimate EL(1)
for the Li atom ground state.
Their pairing energy Ess is, for neutral atoms, given in
their Table 2 as −1.28 eV, and hence for the Li10 clus-
ter we estimate (essentially from 10 separate K shells)
the correlation energy in magnitude to be 0.47 Hartree.
The upper curve in Fig. 7 shows this K-shell–like mag-
nitude of Ec for the Lin clusters under consideration.
Of course, the original 2s electrons will form molecular
orbitals where again there is pairing of electrons with an-
tiparallel spins, and we therefore suppose that the upper-
most curve in Fig. 7 will be below the ‘true’ magnitude
of the correlation energy curve.

For comparison with this K shell estimate, we have
plotted the ‘correlation energy’ given by HF+MP2 per-
turbation theory. The circles in Fig. 7 show our results
for Lin (n = 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10). Two low-lying isomers
were considered in the present study of both Li6 and Li8.
The small-dashed curve is proportional to n as in Eq. (6),
whereas the long-dashed curve is linear in n but does not
pass through the origin, in contrast to Eq. (6).

Evidently, while MP2 corrections obviously improve
the HF energies, they yield only ∼ 50 to 60 % the Li cor-
relation energies, the poorest result being for the dimer.
Following the technique reported in Ref. 13, we have
calculated the correlation energies for lithium clusters us-
ing the HF bond orders. Fig. 7 compares our results with
the values obtained from MP2 calculations. In particu-
lar, the experimental correlation energy Eexp

pending on the particular bond i − j. For Li clusters, this

tion energy of Li2 molecule and its value is 0.06157 a.u.
While up to now all binding and correlation energies have

been calculated within HF+MP2, with full geometry op-
timization, the bond order correlation energies discussed
here refer to the optimized geometries within HF.

Table II reports the calculated correlation energies for
Li clusters obtained from MP2 calculations (EMP2
) and
by using Eq. (8) (EBO
), along with the HF energies. As
shown in Table II and in Fig. 7, the calculated correlation
energies from Eq. (8) are higher than the MP2 energies,
giving for each Li cluster a total molecular energy less
than that calculated at HF+MP2 level. Moreover, it
is noteworthy that the diﬀerence EMP2
increases
with increasing number of atoms in the cluster, and that
the correlation energy per electron, ǫc = EBO
c /Z, is about
constant for all clusters, indicating that the total corre-
lation energy is proportional to the total number of elec-
trons in the molecule. In addition, a comparison of the
total HF+MP2 and the HF+BO energies in Table III
shows that, while for n = 6 both models predict the clus-
ter with D4h symmetry to be stabler than the cluster with
D3h symmetry, at variance with the HF result, both for

c

n = 8 and n = 10 only the HF+BO energies do predict
the Td and D2d to be stabler than the Cs and C1, re-
spectively, in agreement with the purely HF results and,
in the case of Li8, in agreement with the experimental
result1.

Fig. 7 shows that the MP2 correlation energy esti-
mated with the 6-311G∗ basis set is systematically much
smaller than the sum of the (1s)2 atomic pair correla-
tion. The referee has pointed out to us that this prob-
ably results from the basic set deﬁciency for the inner
shell correlation.

. The second column lists the symmetry of the cluster. Last three columns list diﬀerences of these
energies between clusters with same n but diﬀerent symmetry (D4h − D3h, for n = 6; Cs − Td, for n = 8; C1 − D2d, for
n = 10). All energies are in Hartree.

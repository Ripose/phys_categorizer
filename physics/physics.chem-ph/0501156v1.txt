Anisotropic Local Stress and Particle Hopping in a Deeply Supercooled Liquid

The origin of the microscopic motions that lead to stress relaxation in deeply supercooled liquid
remains unclear. We show that in such a liquid the stress relaxation is locally anisotropic which can
serve as the driving force for the hopping of the system on its free energy surface. However, not
all hopping are equally eﬀective in relaxing the local stress, suggesting that diﬀusion can decouple
from viscosity even at local level. On the other hand, orientational relaxation is found to be always
coupled to stress relaxation.

Dynamics of supercooled liquid show many fascinating
properties, namely the non-exponentiality in various re-
laxation functions of dynamical variables, like the stress,
density, composition, polarization and orientation[1, 2,
3, 4, 5]. One often observes a very slow power law de-
cay in the intermediate to long times[6]. Although these
have drawn attention of experimentalists and theoreti-
cians and have been extensively studied, many aspects
still remain ill-understood. It is believed that the nature
of the microscopic motion undergoes a drastic change
at a temperature TB (a temperature substantially be-
low the melting temperature, Tm). At the temperature
TB, the continuous hydrodynamic type motion, which is
prevalent at higher temperature changes to discontinu-
ous motion. It is also believed that TB is close to the
temperature where eﬀects of the underlying free energy
landscape on the dynamics are felt for the ﬁrst time[1].
TB is also found to be close to the mode coupling temper-
ature, Tc. This change in the nature of the microscopic
motion is believed to be the origin of the experimentally
observed α-β bifurcation [7] and also the cross-over be-
tween the rotational and translational relaxation times
[8].

Due to the complexity of the problem, computer sim-
ulations have played a key role in augmenting our under-
standing in this area. In particular, simulations allow one
to directly look at the microscopic events. The computer
simulation studies of the stress auto correlation function
in the supercooled liquid could successfully reproduce the
power law behavior of the stress auto-correlation function
(SAF) [3, 4]. However, in the deeply supercooled liquid,
one ﬁnds that within the simulation time, the relaxation,
after an initial decay (typically 10-20%) becomes fully
arrested. The microscopic origin of the subsequent de-
cay is unclear. The computer simulation studies further
show that the orientational and translational hopping of
particles are the only mode present and hence the stress
relaxation can happen only via hopping. However, since
the relaxation time is much much longer (could be of
the order of ms or sec), the computer simulation results,
(which can explore mostly upto nano second regime and
sometimes micro second regime), cannot include the ef-

fects of these hopping. Therefore, one cannot explore the
relationship between hopping and the total stress relax-
ation.

The experiments on the other hand are successful in
showing the decay of the SAF. However, except a re-
cent work using single molecule spectroscopy [9], these
experiments are macroscopic and do not provide enough
information of the microscopic motions in the system.

Majumdar [10] had earlier discussed the importance of
local relaxation modes (of wavelength less than the short
range order) in giving rise to non-exponentiality in the
stress relaxation function. This work discussed relaxation
in terms of relaxation within small regions, surfaces and
also volumes, with progressive lengthening of time scales.
However, in that analysis the basic mechanism of relax-
ation was still assumed to be continuous.

In this Letter we demonstrate for the ﬁrst time that
in the deeply supercooled liquid (where hopping is the
only surviving large amplitude motion), there is a close
relationship between the local stress and the orientational
and translational hopping. The local SAF is anisotropic
and is found to change drastically during the hopping,
thus showing that the local stress and the hopping of a
particle are intimately connected. The anisotropy in the
local stress could be the driving force for hopping. As the
free energy of the system can be expressed in terms of
the position dependent stress in a generalized Ginzburg-
Landau formulation [11], the change of the anisotropic
stress due to hopping should be regarded as the driving
force for the transitions of the system between diﬀerent
minima of the free energy surface. However, not all hop-
pings are eﬀective in relaxing the stress.

Our solvent is represented by binary Lennard-Jones
mixture, which has been extensively studied [1, 12, 13,
14] and is known to be a good glass former, and our
solute probes are prolate ellipsoids. Pressure is kept con-
stant by Andersen’s piston method [15] while in the case
of temperature, a damped oscillator method has been
adopted which keeps temperature constant at each and
every time step [16]. The piston mass involved here is
0.0027(mA/σ4
A) which is regarded as optimum [16, 17].
The interaction between two ellipsoids with arbitrary ori-
entations is assumed to be given by the Gay-Berne (GB)

potential [18],

where ˆu1 ˆu2 are the axial vectors of the ellipsoids 1 and 2.
ˆr is the vector along the intermolecular vector r = r2 −r1,
where r1 and r2 denote the centers of mass of ellipsoids
1 and 2 respectively. σ(ˆr, ˆu1, ˆu2) and ǫ(ˆr, ˆu1, ˆu2) are the
orientation-dependent range and strength parameters re-
spectively. σ and ǫ depend on the aspect ratio κ. The
minor axis of the ellipsoid is equal to the diameter of
the larger solvent and the major axis is 3 times that of
the minor axis. Finally, the interaction between a sphere
and an ellipsoid is accounted for by a modiﬁed GB-LJ

The ellipsoid in binary mixture system with the above
mentioned potential is a well behaved system and it
can also exhibit the experimentally observed anoma-
lous viscosity dependence of the orientational correla-
tion time [19]. Four ellipsoids were placed far from each
other in a binary mixture of 500 particles with num-
ber of ’A’ particles, NA = 400 and number of ’B’ type
particles NB = 100. The reduced temperature is ex-
pressed as, T ∗(=kBT /ǫA), the reduced pressure as, P ∗(=

At P∗ =6, both hopping and continuous motions ex-
ist in the system, thus the stress relaxation could not be
directly correlated with the hopping. At P∗=10, only
microscopic motion that survives is hopping. In a recent
study, we have reported observation of correlated trans-
lational and orientational hopping [20] at this pressure.
After extensive simulations we could ﬁnd only two dif-
ferent kinds of motions. The translational hopping was
either associated with correlated hopping of 5-6 nearest
neighbors or it exhibited a motion in a ring like tunnel.
While it is possible that other types of motion like iso-
lated hopping can exist, we could not ﬁnd them. The
hopping rate was found to be 2 × 107 where both the
type of motions occurred with almost equal frequency.
In the following we focus on the stress relaxation and its
relation vis-a-vis hopping at P∗=10 and T∗=0.8. The
reduced density of the system is 1.41.

In ﬁgure 1 we show two diﬀerent kinds of spatial hop-
ping observed in our simulations. Both the hoppings

are associated with orientational hopping. In the inset
we also plot the orientational time correlation functions
(OCF), before, during and after the hopping. Figure
1(a) shows the trajectory of the ﬁrst tagged ellipsoid and
inset shows its orientational time correlation function,
< P2(ˆui(0)ˆui(t)) > /< P2(ˆui(0)ˆui(0)) >, were P2 is the
second order Legendre polynomial. The hopping takes
place in 20τ and the displacement is 0.5σ. Here the el-
lipsoid hopping is accompanied by hopping of 5-6 of its
nearest neighbors. The OCF decays only during the pe-
riod of hopping.
In ﬁgure 1 (b) the trajectory of the
second tagged ellipsoid and in the inset its orientational
time correlation functions are shown. Note that in this
case the displacement of the particle is large (1.1σ) and
it also takes place over a very long period of time (50 τ ).
Here we ﬁnd that the tagged particle is moving in a ring
like tunnel. Although the orientational correlation func-
tion decays during the hopping, it’s decay is less when
compared to that of the 1st tagged particle.

deeply supercooled liquid have been reported earlier by
other authors, although they did not discuss this large
displacements over a long time for the ring like motion
[21].

In the following part we discuss in details the local
stress relaxation associated with these two diﬀerent kinds
of hoppings. The local stress around the ellipsoid is
obtained by summing over the stress on the ellipsoid
and its nearest neighbors. The stress has six compo-
nents and the stress auto-correlation function is given
by < σij (0)σij (t) >, where i,j=x,y,z.
In case of only
Lennard-Jones ﬂuid, σij = σji, but for particles interact-
ing via GB and GB-LJ potential this is not so.

Figures 2 (a) and (b) show the SAF around the 1st
tagged ellipsoid, before and after the period it is hopping,
respectively. Before the hopping there is an anisotropy
of the stress. The xy and yx components of the stress are
much larger than the others and also their correlations
cease to decay. This anisotropy leads to a hopping of the
ellipsoid, mostly in the z direction. During the hopping
there is a relaxation of the SAF in xy and yx components
and after hopping all the components relax. Note that
the total stress in all the components are also lower.

respectively. Before the hopping there is an anisotropy
of the stress. The yz and zy components of the stress
are much larger than others, and also their correlations
cease to decay. This leads to the hopping of the ellipsoid,
mostly in the x direction. During and after the hopping
there is an exchange of the stress. After the hopping
although the yz component of the stress relaxes and also
the t=0 value of all the components reduces, the SAF
in the xz and zx components cease to decay. Thus, this
kind of motion in a ring like tunnel does not lead to the
relaxation of all the components of the stress.

The orientational correlation function of the 1st tagged
particle relaxes more ( inset of ﬁgure 1 (a)) compared to
that of the 2nd tagged particle (inset of ﬁgure 1(b)) when
computed in the respective intervals where they are hop-
ping. From ﬁgure 2 and 3 we found that the local stress
relaxation takes place when the 1st ellipsoid is hopping
where as when the second ellipsoid is hopping although
there is an exchange of stress between it’s components,
the local SAF does not completely relax. There is a direct
connection between the local stress and the orientational
relaxation functions, implying that rotation and viscosity
are coupled even in a localized region.

Figures 3 (a) and (b) show the SAF around the 2nd
tagged ellipsoid, before and after the period it is hopping,

In order to understand what happens to the surround-
ing of the local region when there is a relaxation of stress

4

due to hopping we have studied the stress auto correla-
tion function of a bigger region of 2 σ around the 1st
ellipsoid.We found there are about 62-67 particles in this
region. Although there is an anisotropy of the compo-
nents of the stress in this larger region, this anisotropy
cannot be correlated with the direction of hopping. Some
of the components of SAF build up immediately after
hopping and in a later time it relaxes. Similar analysis
when done in a even bigger region shows that it takes
longer for the stress of that region to relax and also the
eﬀect of the hopping is less.

In conclusion we demonstrated that the direction of
the hopping of the tagged particle is determined by the
anisotropy in the stress. Anisotropic stress relaxation is
diﬀerent when there is a many-particle hopping and there
is a motion in a ring like tunnel. Although there is an
exchange of stress between the components due to the
particle motion, the stress relaxation is less in a ring like
motion. Interestingly, the eﬀect of hopping is found to
spread over the adjoining region like ripples with the am-
plitude decreasing with increasing distance from the el-
lipsoid. We note that in the case of the second tagged el-

lipsoid (Fig.1b) although it translates more, the stress re-
laxation during its hopping is less. Thus suggesting that
translational motion and viscosity are decoupled even in
a localized region. On the other hand, the orientational
relaxation and also the stress relaxation is more for the
ﬁrst ellipsoid. Thus suggesting that the orientational mo-
tion always remains coupled to viscosity. This is in agree-
ment with the experimental results and in fact provides a
microscopic explanation of the results which are known
for a long time. There can be an apparent connection
between the stress tensor and the momentum circula-
tion. Thus it is possible that the non-decaying SAF im-
plies that momentum circulation exists in a deeply super-
cooled liquid Since the anisotropic stress contributes to
the free energy of the system, a change in the anisotropy
drives the system from one free energy minimum to the
other. When the anisotropy in the stress disappears and
all the SAF relaxes then the system deﬁnitely moves to
a lower free energy minimum.

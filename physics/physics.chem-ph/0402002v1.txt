Abstract

Hydroxyapatite samples were produced by two diﬀerent wet-chemical methods, and
characterized by x-ray diﬀraction, infrared and compression strength measurements.
The x-ray diﬀraction measurements were simulated using the Rietveld method, and
structural data as lattice parameters and average crystallite size were obtained.
The infrared spectra showed the presence of CO2−
ions in all samples, indicating
3
a contamination by these ions. By mixing samples produced by both methods, a
bioceramic was obtained and, after sintering, samples with very high compression
strengths (26–30 MPa) were obtained.

Key words: Hydroxyapatite, x-ray diﬀraction, mechanical properties.

1 Introduction

Calcium hydroxyapatite, Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2 (CaHAp), is the main inorganic
component of hard tissues of the bones of vertebrates. It answers for 60–70%
of the mineral phase in the human bone [1,2,3], and it is a member of the ‘ap-
atite’ family of compounds. Biological apatites, which comprise the mineral
phases of tissues like enamel, dentin and bone, usually have compositions and
crystallinity slightly diﬀerent from the stoichiometric CaHAp. These struc-
tural diﬀerences are responsible for diﬀerent physical and mechanical proper-
ties found for these materials. In the body, they were usually observed to be
carbonate (CO2−
3 ) substituted and calcium deﬁcient [4]. Bone tissue has the
ability to regenerate, forming healthy tissue that grows in the direction of the
damaged tissue in order to repair it. So, if a material with physical and chem-
ical properties similar to the biological bone constituents could be produced,
the growth process of healthy tissue can be accelerated and the recovery time
of the patients can be decreased, for instance. Such materials should also have
porosity and compression strength similar to the tissues they will substitute,
in order to assure biocompatibility. Successful experiments on animals (rats,
rabbits and dogs) led to clinical application of CaHAp bioceramics in humans
over the last two decades. These experiments included the grafting of peri-
odontal defects, post-traumatic long bone defects and augmentation of the
alveolar ridge and maxillofacial skeleton [5,6,7,8,9,10].

To produce synthetic CaHAp with the desired properties, chemical and hy-
drothermal methods can be used [1,11,12]. In general, these methods allow
the production of materials with good crystallinity, physiological stability and
with the morphological characteristics of the hard tissues, but some of the
physical, chemical and mechanical properties of the ﬁnal products usually de-
pend on the speciﬁc method used in the synthesis. In addition, contaminant
phases, such as calcium oxide (CaO) and tricalcium phosphate (α– and β–
TCP) can also be formed during the fabrication of CaHAp. Here, we have
used a combination of two diﬀerent methods to produce CaHAp bioceramics,
which were studied by x-ray diﬀraction (XRD) and infrared (IR) spectroscopy
techniques. In addition their compression strengths were also measured. The
results obtained indicated that the mechanical properties depend on the con-
tent of CO2−
ions incorporated into the CaHAp lattice, which substitute PO3−
3
4
ions, and possibly on the content of Ca2+ ions substituted by Mg2+ and occa-
sionally Na+ ions.

2 Experimental Procedures

2.1 Preparation of the samples

2.1.1 Method A

In the method A the samples (hereafter called A-HAp) were prepared in
the following way: 0.090 mol of (NH4)2HPO4 (Nuclear) and 0.152 mol of
Ca(NO3)2· 4H2O (Nuclear) were completely dissolved in distilled water. Thus,
a NH4OH 25vol% solution is added to the previous solution. The obtained so-
lution is then heated at 65◦C for 90 min under stirring. After that, the beaker
is sealed, and the solution is heated to its boiling point for 2 h. Then, it
is cooled to room temperature and the precipitates were allowed to settle
overnight. Next, they were ﬁltered, washed with distilled water in order to
keep a pH 7 and dried at 60◦C for 4 h. Some amounts of the A-HAp samples
were sintered at 900◦C in an electrically heated box furnace Jung model 0912
for 1 h and they will be called A-HAp-S [13].

2.1.2 Method B

The samples prepared using method B (hereafter called B-HAp) were pro-
duced in the following way: ﬁrst, a solution (hereafter solution B1) was formed
by dissolving 0.182 mol of Ca(NO3)2· 4H2O (Nuclear) and 0.0105 mol of
MgCl2· 6H2O (Reagen) in 500 ml of distilled water. Then, a second solu-
tion (solution B2) was prepared by dissolving 0.387 mol of Na2HPO4· 7H2O
(Nuclear), 1.25 mol of NaOH (Nuclear), 0.357 mol of NaHCO3 (Vetec) and
0.00752 mol of Na4P2O7· 10H2O (Resimap) in 1300 ml of distilled water. Next,
the solutions B1 and B2 were put together in a beaker at room temperature
and a white precipitate is obtained, which is washed until a pH 8 is reached.
Then, the cream was dried at 80◦C for 48 h, and a part of it was also sintered
at 900◦C for 1 h, forming the B-HAp-S samples [14].

2.1.3 Bioceramic Samples

The bioceramic samples (BIO) were prepared by mixing 1 g of A-HAp, 2 g
of B-HAp and 1.8 ml of Na2HPO4· 7H2O 0.2 M, which acts as an accelerator
for the reaction. After that, cylindrical samples of 10 mm height and 5 mm
diameter were prepared with the obtained cream, and they were heat treated
at 50◦C for 2 h. The bioceramic cylinders were also sintered at 900◦C for 1
h (BIO-S). In order to perform compression strength comparisons, cylindrical
samples of A-HAp and B-HAp were made in the same way, and some of them
were also sintered at 900◦C.

2.2 X-ray Measurements

X-ray measurements were collected using a Rigaku power difractometer, Mini-
ﬂex model, working with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 ˚A). XRD measurements
were taken for all samples produced. The patterns obtained are shown in Sec.
3.

2.3 Infrared Measurements

Infrared measurements were performed from 400 to 4000 cm−1 using a FTIR
Perkin-Elmer infrared spectrometer. Spectra were taken for A-HAp, B-HAp,
BIO and BIO-S samples.

2.4 Compression strength measurements

The compression strength measurements were performed in all samples using
a 3M Instron 4444 equipment.

3 Results and Discussion

Figure 1 shows the x-ray pattern for A-HAp and its simulation using the Ri-
etveld reﬁnement procedure [15]. It was indexed to the hexagonal structure
of hydroxyapatite given in JCPDS card 730294. As it can be seen from this
ﬁgure, a good agreement was achieved. The reﬁned lattice parameters ob-
tained were a = 9.4207 ˚A and c = 6.8898 ˚A. From the reﬁnement and using
the Scherrer formula [16], an average crystallite size of 164 ˚A was obtained,
indicating that it is in the nanometric form. No signals of contamination by
β-TCP (tricalcium phosphate) or CaO (calcium oxide) were found in this mea-
surement. After the sintering process, its crystallinity increases, as it can be
seen in ﬁgure 2, which shows the x-ray pattern for the A-HAp-S sample with
its Rietveld reﬁned simulation. Again, there is no contamination by β-TCP or
CaO. The new lattice parameters were a = 9.4236 ˚A and c = 6.8847 ˚A. These
lattice parameters are diﬀerent from those given in the JCPDS card 730294
for hydroxyapatite (a = 9.432 ˚A and c = 6.881 ˚A). These diﬀerences (decrease
in a parameter and increase in c parameter) are usually associated with a con-
tamination of the CaHAp lattice by CO2−
ions [1]. This contamination could
3
be conﬁrmed by the IR measurement performed on the A-HAp sample, shown
in ﬁg. 3.a. In this ﬁgure, the characteristic bands of hydroxyapatite associated

4

with PO3−
ions [17] can be seen around 470, 567, 603, 1035 and 1100 cm−1,
4
and small shoulders can be seen at 967 cm−1, also associated with PO3−
ions,
4
and at 630 and 3575 cm−1, which are assigned to OH− ions [2,17]. The broad
bands around 1639 and 3447 cm−1 are associated with water in the sample
[1]. The contamination by CO2−
ions gives rises to the bands at 870, 1420
and 1465 cm−1, and the small bands around 2030 cm−1 are associated with
CO2 vibrational modes, which was probably absorbed from the air [1,12]. The
presence of CO2−
ions can be attributed to some contamination of the start-
ing reagents and also to the air. Two points should be noted here: ﬁrst, as
biological apatite usually have CO2−
ions, the contamination observed above
3
is not undesirable. Second, in the sintered sample much of water and CO2−
3
ions are expelled from the sample. The average crystallite size of A-HAp-S
increases to 536 ˚A, making it interesting for several biological applications.

or CaO were found. Its simulation obtained from the Rietveld reﬁnement is

also seen in ﬁg. 4, and the reﬁned lattice parameters are a = 9.4023 ˚A and
c = 6.8877 ˚A. There is a large reduction of the lattice parameter a, whereas c
increases, in agreement with the fact that now the samples were prepared using
reagents containing CO2−
for
3
CO2−
ions. This substitution produces better-deﬁned bands associated with
3
CO2−
ions, which can be seen in ﬁg. 3.b around 875, 1418 and 1464 cm−1.
3
This ﬁgure also shows the bands seen in ﬁg. 3.a for A-HAp. The PO3−
and
4
OH− bands are found in the same positions, but the water bands change to
1645 and 3454 cm−1, respectively. Again, there is a small contamination by
CO2 from air. The average crystallite size of this phase is 322 ˚A, almost twice
of the HAp samples, suggesting that the method used in B-HAp preparation
is able to produce samples more suitable for biological applications than the
method used in A-HAp.

Figure 5 shows the x-ray pattern obtained for B-HAp-S and its simulation
obtained using the Rietveld reﬁnement procedure. It is similar to the pattern
shown in ﬁg. 2, and it was also indexed to the hydroxyapatite phase. The

reﬁned lattice parameters obtained were a = 9.4213 ˚A and c = 6.8731 ˚A,
showing an increase in the lattice parameter a and an unexpected large de-
crease in c, which could indicate a larger release of Co2−
ions by this sample.
In addition, it is known that Mg2+ ions can replace Ca2+ ions in the hydroxya-
patite lattice. Since Mg2+ ions are present in the reagents used in method B,
this fact could be also responsible for these changes in the lattice parameters.
The average crystallite size of B-HAp-S is 467 ˚A, a little smaller than that
found for A-HAp-S.

Figure 6 shows the x-ray pattern measured for the BIO-S samples. It is similar
to those seen in ﬁgs. 2 and 5, and corresponds to the hydroxyapatite phase
found in all x-ray patterns above. Its Rietveld simulation is also shown in ﬁg.
6, and the reﬁned lattice parameters are a = 9.4241 ˚A and c = 6.8825 ˚A.
The average crystallite size of BIO-S reaches 561 ˚A, showing that this is the
sample with the highest degree of crystallinity. The IR spectra measured for
these samples before and after the sintering process can be seen in ﬁg. 3.c
and 3.d. Fig. 3.c shows the characteristic bands of hydroxyapatite (the PO3−
4
vibrations at 470, 567, 603, 1036 and 1095 cm−1), well deﬁned CO2−
3 bands
around 873, 1420 and 1460 cm−1, a OH− band as a shoulder of the very broad
band associated to water at 3448 cm−1, besides the water band at 1644 cm−1
and the CO2 band at 2000 cm−1. After the sintering, the water bands are
much reduced, and OH− bands around 633 and 3568 cm−1 are much better
resolved. The CO2−
3 bands about 1420 cm−1 almost disappeared, indicating a
great release of CO2−
3

ions by the sample.

Although the x-ray measurements of the samples have indicated that the hy-
droxyapatite phase is present in all samples, some diﬀerences among them
exist, as can be seen by comparing the lattice parameters and average crystal-
lite sizes obtained, and also the IR spectra seen in ﬁg. 3. However, the most
impressive diﬀerence is veriﬁed in the compression strength measurements
performed on the samples. The cylindrical A-HAp samples have compression
strengths ranging from 2 to 5 MPa. After sintering, these samples (A-HAp-S)

reach compression strengths of 6-9 MPa. The compression strengths of the
cylindrical B-HAp samples are less than 1 MPa, and do not seem to change
after sintering (B-HAp-S). Considering now the cylindrical bioceramic sam-
ples, their compression strengths changes from 1-2 MPa before sintering (BIO)
to 26–30 MPa after sintering (BIO-S), an increase by almost ﬁve times when
compared to the values found for A-HAp-S and by six times when compared
to usual hydroxyapatite values reported in the literature [11,13].

A possible explanation for this fact is that by mixing the samples produced by
the two diﬀerent methods, the contamination by CO2−
3 , Mg2+ and maybe Na+
ions decreased and reached an optimal value, which is lesser than that seen in
the B-HAp and greater than that found in the A-HAp samples alone. Another
possibility is that, although B-HAp and B-HAp-S have those contaminants,
their porosity is too large even after sintering, thus decreasing their compres-
sion strength. The increase in the compression strength of BIO-S makes it
a very good material for biological application in dental and bone implants,
for instance. A deeper investigation about the causes of this behavior is in
progress and will be published elsewhere.

4 Conclusion

From this study we can conclude that

(1) Calcium hydroxyapatite, Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2, was produced by using both
methods described in Sec. 2.1, as conﬁrmed by the Rietveld reﬁnements
performed on the x-ray diﬀraction patterns of all samples. The infrared
spectra agree with this veriﬁcation and show the characteristic bands
of hydroxyapatite. The crystallinity of all samples improves after the
sintering process, as indicated by the increase in the average crystallite

8

sizes.

(2) A-HAp samples have a small contamination formed by CO2−
3

ions, which
is not undesired since biological apatite usually shows about 4% of these
ions in its composition. B-HAp samples, besides a higher contamination
by CO2−
ions, also have Mg2+ and maybe Na+ ions in their composition.
The contamination by CO2−
is also conﬁrmed by the infrared spectra of
3
the samples, which show the CO2−

3 bands.

3

(3) The B-HAp and B-HAp-S samples have a larger porosity than A-HAp
and A-HAp-S samples, as conﬁrmed by the compression strength mea-
surements, which indicate that B-HAp and B-HAp-S are too soft ma-
terials. Although the compression strength of A-HAp-S increases after
the sintering, this value is still low for some dental and bone implant
applications.

(4) The best samples were obtained by mixing the samples produced by the
two methods and submitting them to the sintering process, obtaining
the BIO-S samples. Their compression strengths reach 26–30 MPa, very
suitable for dental and bone implant applications. A possible explanation
for the improvement obtained is that, by mixing the samples produced
by the two methods, the contamination by CO2−
3 and Mg2+ ions reached
optimal values, increasing the mechanical properties of the samples.

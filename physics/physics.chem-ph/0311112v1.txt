Abstract

The ro–vibrational spectra of molecules dissolved in liquid 4He nanodroplets display rotational

structure. Where resolved, this structure has been used to determine a temperature that has been

assumed to equal that of the intrinsic excitations of the helium droplets containing the molecules.

Consideration of the density of states as a function of energy and total angular momentum demon-

strates that there is a small but signiﬁcant bias of the rotor populations that make the temperature

extracted from a ﬁt to its rotational level populations slightly higher than the temperature of the

ripplons of the droplet. This bias grows with both the total angular momentum of the droplet and

with the moment of inertia of the solute molecule.

INTRODUCTION

A hallmark of ro–vibrational spectroscopy of molecules in liquid 4He nanodroplets has

been the observation of rotational structure, as in the gas phase [1, 2]. The distribution

of intensity of transitions in this structure has allowed the determination of the rotational

temperature of these molecules, and it has been assumed that this provides a measure of

the temperature of the droplets themselves [1, 3]. This assumption has been supported

by the close similarity of the temperatures determined for a wide range of molecules and

by the assumption that on the long time scales between pickup of solutes and spectroscopic

interrogation, the entire system will come to equilibrium as the droplets cool by evaporation.

Adriaan Dockter and I have modeled the evaporative cooling of pure and doped helium

nanodroplets using an angular momentum conserving statistical rate model [4]. These cal-

culations have predict that the droplets cool to a temperature close to those inferred from

experiments and previous evaporative cooling calculations, but with a vastly broader dis-

tribution of energy and total angular momentum than for a canonical distribution at the

same temperature. We also found, much to our initial surprise, that while the populations

of the rotational levels of a solvated rotor follow a thermal distribution, the ﬁtted temper-

ature of the rotor populations is higher than that of the droplet itself. While this would

seem to violate a fundamental principle of thermodynamics, as will be demonstrated below,

this divergence of the two temperatures is in fact a consequence of the constraints imposed

by conservation of angular momentum. The temperature of the helium is deﬁned by the

inverse of the derivative of the log of the density of states with respect to energy at ﬁxed

total angular momentum. However, when a rotor is excited to a state with rotor angular

momentum quantum number j, the internal degrees of freedom of the droplet can have an-

gular momentum values between

and J + j, where J is the total angular momentum

quantum number, which is treated as a conserved quantity. Thus the derivatives of the

density of droplet states with respect to J contributes to the rotor population.

STATE DISTRIBUTIONS

At the temperature of helium nanodroplets, 0.38 K, the only intrinsic droplet excitations

are surface ripplon modes [5]. The density of states and other thermodynamic quantities

2

can be written as a function of a reduced energy, ¯E = E/ER where ER = 3.77 kBK/√N
and N is the number of helium atoms in the droplet [5]. We denote the density of states as a
function of reduced energy and total angular momentum as ρRJ ( ¯E, J), and the density states
J (2J + 1)ρRJ ( ¯E, J). Using methods
summed over angular momentum states as ρR( ¯E) =

recently described [6], these can be well approximated by the analytical expressions

if the values a = 2.5088, b = -4.3180, c = 0.8642 and d = -0.3524 are used [7]. Note that

for ﬁxed J, the density is the number of distinct states, i.e. does not include the (2J + 1)

spatial quantization degeneracy of each such state. We deﬁne the ripplon microcanonical
temperature, TR( ¯E), and with ﬁxed total energy and angular momentum, TRJ ( ¯E, J), by

where in both cases, temperature is measured in units of reduced ripplon energy, ER, divided

We now consider a droplet that has a solvated rigid linear rotor, with eﬀective rotational

constant B, given again in units of ER. Let j be the rotational quantum number of the

rotor, JR the rotational quantum number of the ripplons, and J the total rotational quantum
number. The total density of states for ﬁxed values of ¯E, J is given by

A rotor temperature, Tj( ¯E, J) can be deﬁned from a Boltzmann ﬁt to the rotor level pop-

ulations P (j). This latter corresponds to the “droplet temperature” that has been reported

in numerous experiments. This assignment of the rotor temperature to that of entire system,
i.e. that Tj( ¯E, J) = T ( ¯E, J) is natural assumption for a system in microcanonical equilib-
rium, i.e. by equating P (j) to the ratio of density of states. If we ignore angular momentum

conservation and sum over all values of J, then the above identiﬁcation would be exact as
long as the mean energy in the rotor, Tr, if much less than the total energy in the droplet, ¯E,

so that the “heat bath” of ripplon states does not change temperature signiﬁcantly over the
range of signiﬁcantly populated rotor states. Equivalently, we expect Tj( ¯E, J) = T ( ¯E, J) if
that ρR( ¯E) can be approximated by ρR( ¯E

.

Note that if the ﬁnite heat capacity of the droplet heat bath is considered, then we would

Bj(j + 1)/TR( ¯E)

(cid:16)

expect the population in higher rotational levels to fall oﬀ faster than predicted by the

Boltzmann distribution, and thus the eﬀective temperature determined by a ﬁt to the rotor

populations to be lower than the droplet temperature.

When we look at the J conserving ensemble, we must consider the fact that the average

value of JR(JR + 1) equals to J(J + 1)

j(j + 1) for ﬁxed J, j. Thus the population of

−

diﬀerent rotor levels will be inﬂuenced not only by TR, but also by the J dependent factor

in ρRJ , which has the same form as the rotational distribution function of a spherical top

in a canonical ensemble. In order to test the size of the expected bias in the estimate of
T ( ¯E) by Tj, we will examine numerical results for droplet of N = 3 000 and 10 000 helium

atoms, for which ER = 0.069 and 0.0377 K respectively. Based upon our evaporative cooling

calculations [4], we will assume that the droplets cool to a ﬁnal temperature of 0.35 K, but

have a wide range of ﬁnal angular momentum values, J. This condition allows calculation
of an isothermal curve ¯E(J) for each droplet size. We further assume that B = 1 GHz,

which equals 0.70 (1.27) in reduced units for droplets of 3 000 (10 000) helium atoms. This

is the eﬀective B constant for SF6 dissolved in helium, from which the temperature of helium
nanodroplets was ﬁrst measured [1]. It is found that T ( ¯E(J), J) = TRJ ( ¯E(J), J) to better

than 1 % for all values of J over the range from 0–4000.

It is found that the values of

P (j) ﬁt a Boltzmann distribution to high accuracy, so that values of Tr are well deﬁned.

However, over this range of J, we ﬁnd a small be systematic diﬀerence in the values of
between Tj( ¯E(J), J) and T ( ¯E(J), J), as demonstrated in ﬁgure 1. The ratio of Tj( ¯E(J), J)
to T ( ¯E(J), J) is found to be approximately proportional to B−1, i.e. is linearly proportional

4

to the eﬀective rotational moment of inertia of the rotor in helium (including the contribution

due to motion of the helium). As is evident from the ﬁgure, the size of the bias decreases

for larger droplets, though less than linearly with number of helium atoms in the droplet.

The present results demonstrate that for helium droplets with signiﬁcant trapped angular

momentum, the population of rotational levels of rotors will be biased from that predicted

by a Boltzmann distribution at the temperature of either the droplet excitation modes or

the temperature of the entire system. The size of the bias is on the order that should be

detectable by careful measurement of the droplet rotational constant as the temperature of

the pickup gas (and thus the initial collisional angular momentum) is increased. Previous

experiments have reported a range of rotational temperatures, but up to know these do not

appear to have been considered physically signiﬁcant. For example, in a study of the cluster

size dependence of the spectrum of SF6, the temperature was found to be constant to within

statistical noise (0.36

0.40 K) for droplets of more than a few thousand He atoms, but to

−

systematically increase for smaller droplets, down to a value of 0.48(20) K for droplets of a

few hundred He atoms [8]. The authors concluded that the temperature of smaller droplets

was higher, but the present result suggest that another possibility is that the eﬀect they

observed could be, at least in part, due to the bias eﬀect predicted by the present work.

Nauta and Miller found that for the spectrum of HF dimer, the rotational temperature was

0.34(1) K [9], below the excepted droplet temperature of 0.38(2) K. It should be pointed out

that the rotational constant of HF dimer in helium is three times larger than that of SF6, and

that the pickup of two HF molecules should deposit considerably less angular momentum

than the pickup of SF6. It should be noted that the size of the bias is a function only of the

total rotational quantum number, and thus the eﬀect should be essentially unchanged for a

symmetric top or spherical top molecule. For an asymmetric top, this eﬀect should lead to a

failure of the transition intensities to follow that expected for a gas in thermal equilibrium if

this bias eﬀect is ignored. Stimulated by the present analysis, Roger Miller and collaborators

have made an attempt to look in a systematic way at the temperature extracted from ﬁts to

rotor populations for diﬀerent molecules. Unfortunately, the asymmetries of the lineshapes

often observed for the lowest rovibrational transitions lead to model dependent biases in the

ﬁtted rotational temperatures that could not be disentangled from the expected eﬀects [10].

This give yet one more reason for the need to address this problem of lineshapes of ro-

vibrational transitions in helium nanodroples beyond the one previous attempt [11]. That

5

previous work assumed a canonical ensemble of internal states which the recent evaporative

cooling work has now shown to be a poor assumption.

[7] In [6], the integrated density of states was ﬁt to the functional form used here for the density

of states. However, with a slight change in the constants, to the values given here, this form

also accurately ﬁts the density of states for reduced energy greater than

50.

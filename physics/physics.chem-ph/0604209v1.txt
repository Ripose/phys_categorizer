Abstract

Ion transport in biological and synthetic nanochannels is characterized by such phenomena as

ion current ﬂuctuations, rectiﬁcation, and pumping. Recently, it has been shown that the nanofab-

ricated synthetic pores could be considered as analogous to biological channels with respect to their

transport characteristics [1, 2]. The ion current rectiﬁcation is analyzed. Ion transport through

cylindrical nanopores is described by the Smoluchowski equation. The model is considering the

symmetric nanopore with asymmetric charge distribution. In this model, the current rectiﬁcation

in asymmetrically charged nanochannels shows a diode-like shape of I

V characteristic.

It is

−

shown that this feature may be induced by the coupling between the degree of asymmetry and the

depth of internal electric potential well. The role of concentration gradient is discussed.

INTRODUCTION

The role of ion transport through narrow protein channels for living cells has been widely

studied. There are many experimental and theoretical attempts in understanding the ac-

tivity of biological channels at physiological conditions. Among models of cellular electrical

activity the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz (GHK) current equation plays an important role. It is

worth noting that the equation assumes of a constant electric ﬁeld. There are other mod-

els in biophysical literature e.g. barrier models with several free-energy barriers within the

channel [3, 4, 5]. These models are phenomenological, i.e. the potential energy barriers

used in the models often do not correspond to physical properties of the channel. Although

they can give good quantitative descriptions of some experimental data [6], they fail to ﬁt

these data sets which include I

V relations measured in asymmetrical solutions [7]. One

−

of the reasons is that their the electrostatics is modeled incorrectly. On the other hand, the

Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) model, based on the mean ﬁeld approximation, is an alter-

native theory. Apart from its own limitations [8, 9, 10], the 3DPNP model seems to take

into account electrostatics correctly [7]. However, in general, it is not possible to obtain an

exact solution to the Nernst-Planck (NP) equation, coupled to the electric ﬁeld by means of

the Poisson equation. That is why we consider a simpliﬁed system that allows for intuitive

understanding of the underlying mechanism of examined phenomenon.

The intention of the paper is to demonstrate that the asymmetry of the internal physical

ﬁeld also plays a signiﬁcant role in permeation. To prove this conjecture we focus on the

only one source of the asymmetry, viz. the electrostatics. Thus, geometrical eﬀects of the

channel are purposely omitted by choice of the cylindrical structure of the channel. Chemical

structure is not considered, either. Factors such as geometry, chemical structure, etc. may

also be sources of the potential asymmetry. The selectivity ﬁlters seem to be governed by

diﬀerent mechanisms [11], therefore they are not discussed here. We propose a simpliﬁed

continuous model that is able to explain the experimental behavior of interest.

The studies of the synthetic channels, which in several aspects resemble the biological ones

[12, 13], may be helpful in investigating the mechanism of ionic transport. The ionic currents

through these nanochannels exhibit several peculiarities. One of them is the asymmetric

and non-linear shape of current-voltage characteristic both for diﬀerent biological channels

[14, 15, 16] and for asymmetrically shaped synthetic ones [1, 2, 17, 18]. These asymmetries

2

in the I-V characteristics are related, among others, to the nanopumping mechanism [19]

and to the asymmetry of nanodiﬀusion [20, 21].

It is worth mentioning that the role of

spatial/time asymmetry in large number of physical processes was discussed in [22], and that

the experiment has shown that rectiﬁcation occurs for colloidal particles in a microfabricated

channel with a topological ratchet-like polarity [23]. The above-mentioned results point out

that the theoretical explanation of current rectiﬁcation in nanochannels should enclose the

intrinsic asymmetry of channels.

The aim of this work is to stress the role of the asymmetry of potential well inside the

channel in the rectiﬁcation process and in the diode-like shape of I

V dependence.

In

our model the total current I through the channel is driven both by an external and an

internal electrical ﬁeld. We shall investigate the shape of I

V curve for symmetric and

−

−

asymmetric cases of the potential well and for diﬀerent depths of the well. For this purpose

we need the given shape of the potential well inside the channel. Thus, the ﬁrst problem

we shall consider is that of determining the electric potential φint inside the channel due

to prescribed surface density σ. For simplicity, we shall consider a coaxial inﬁnitely long

cylindrical channel and we take the radius R of the cylinder small enough to allow the ions

go only through the channel along z-axis, which implies the lack of electrolytic solution

inside the channel (no screening). If we assume the equilibration in the transverse direction

of the channel [24] we can operate with the z-dependent potential φr=0

int (z) on the z-axis

only. Therefore our problem is reduced from the three-dimensional to the one-dimensional

description. We shall discuss the evolution of the probability density of the ﬁnding an ion

inside the channel, therefore we shall use the 1-D Smoluchowski equation.

The Smoluchowski equation gives the conditional probability that the particle starting

from the point z(t0) reaches the point z at the time t [25, 26]. It describes the diﬀusion of

probability, because the process of diﬀusion is the superposition of Brownian motions of the

molecules of the substance under consideration [26, 27]. In an open state, the measurable

electric current through the biological channels is at the picoampere level which gives about

108 ions per second [28]. Thus one ion passes the channel at the tens of nanosecond and after

108 passages we get the measurable electric current. These estimations enable us to pass

from one-ion description via probability density, i.e. from the Smoluchowski equation to the

continuous description in terms of the electric current density, i.e. to the Smoluchowski-

Nernst-Planck equation.

II. MODEL

The problem which we want to consider is that of electric current ﬂowing through cylin-

drical channel. There is a broad collection of papers in which the cylindrical synthetic

nanotubes [18, 29, 30, 31] and biological cylindrical ionic channels, e.g. gramicidin channel

[32], Class 1 porins [33] are discussed. Let us consider a dielectric membrane (biological

or synthetic) separating two large regions of space that contain some electrolytic solutions.

There is a pore in the membrane (one-dimensional channel of a radius R and a length L,

see Fig. 1) through which the ions can move more or less freely.

FIG. 1: Channel in cartesian coordinates (x, y, z) with the z axis along the axis of the cylinder;

the cylinder has a radius R and a length L; V0, VL are potentials and c0, cL concentrations on the

left and on the right side of the channel, respectively.

The biological ion channels are ion selective [34]. The same feature is displayed in some

synthetic channels [2, 35]. Therefore, for simplicity, we assume that only positive ions can

enter our pore. In Cole’s model [36] of electrical activity in membranes the driving force for

the ions is given by the diﬀerence between the membrane potential U = Vin(0)

−
and the reversal potential, which is the potential at which the current is zero.

Vout(L)

In the

Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz model (GHK model) of ion ﬂux through the channel the simplifying

approximation is made that the potential gradient through the channel is constant [37]. On

the other hand in experiments with synthetic membranes the driving force is caused by

electrodes of potential V+ and V−, located in the electrolyte at macroscopic distances from

the membrane (Fig. 1 in [18]). Thus in both cases we put the related potential in the form:

4

φext(z) = V+ −

Uz/L,

(1)

where U = V+ −
channel aﬀect the local electric ﬁeld. Thus, the related electric potential may be given by a

V− and L is a length of the channel. (In general, ions moving through the

more complicated function. However, if the channel is short or the ionic concentrations on

either side of the membrane are small this approximation seems to be correct [6].)

We consider charged channel with a given shape of internal potential φr=0

int (z) along the
z axis. Therefore, the total electric ﬁeld ~E acting on ions inside the channel is a linear
superposition of the external ~Eext and the internal ~Eint ﬁelds, the latter one induced by

charges on the wall of the channel. The goal of the following analysis is to demonstrate that

the ﬁeld asymmetry is suﬃcient to observe diode-like shape of I

V relation. Let us consider

two shapes of the internal potential φr=0

−
int (z) described below and presented in Fig.2. They

roughly correspond to two types of channels, short biological (Fig. 2a) and long synthetic

ones (Fig. 2b).

FIG. 2: The shape of potential well φint (we use dimensionless coordinate z = z/L and potential

φint = βeφint a) for ǫout = 2ǫ0, ǫint = 80ǫ0, σg = 0, 015 e/nm2, R = 0.004 and g = 0.5 ((1)-line)

and g = 0.25 ((2)-line); b) for ratchet-like shape with φ(L1 = 0) = φ(L2 = 1) = 0, φ(g) =

1 and

−

g = 0.5 ((1)-line) and g = 0.008 ((2)-line).

The ﬁrst potential shape we propose to consider is the potential φint of the form shown

in Fig. 2a. This shape of the potential well, which results from charged residues localized at

z = g, might simulate the situation in short biological [e.g. [33]] and synthetic [31] channels.

To ﬁnd this shape we use the Eq. A.5 (see Appendix) and we put the surface charge density

into the formula (A.7) to be σ(z) = σgδ(z

g). The value of the parameter g gives us the

asymmetry of the function φint.

−

The second shape, which corresponds to continuous charge distribution, is the electro-

static potential φint in the “ratchet-like” shape (Fig. 2b). This case seems to be more

adequate to the long synthetic tubes in which the ratio of length to width goes to 0, thus

the approximation of an inﬁnitely long cylinder works well [18].

III. RESULTS

The kinetic Smoluchowski equation is commonly used in various physical, chemical, etc.,

problems [25]. The equation describes diﬀusion in any physical ﬁeld. Therefore a model

based on this equation can be placed between these two GHK and PNP models (the GHK

equation is the 1D Smoluchowski equation in a constant ﬁeld).

Let us start from the 1D Smoluchowski equation that contain the electrostatic ﬁeld:

where Ez =

φ(z) is the z-component of electric ﬁeld, j(z, t) denotes probability density

current, which describes the ﬂux produced by diﬀusion of cations. They are driven by

∂
∂z

−

the diﬀerence in their probabilities of entering the pore from the left p(0) and from the

right p(L), respectively and by ionic migration caused by diﬀerence in electric potential.

We assume here that the mobility of a particle u fulﬁlls the Nernst-Einstein equation, the

diﬀusion coeﬃcient D = u/β, where β = 1/kBT . The ion mobility µ = ezcu, where e is the

electric charge, and zc is the cation valence.

(we use here the identiﬁcation mentioned in the introduction i.e. one ion passes the channel

at the tens of nanosecond and after 108 passages we get the measurable electric current).

For simplicity we use dimensionless coordinate z = z/L, and potential φ = βeφ. For the

potassium cations zc = 1. Thus, the electric current resulting from mass current is:

Now, we analyze I

V relations for two kinds of potential function φint(z) that are

described in Sec. Model. Let us start from the second case being ratchet-like function of

z. We use the analytic solution for current that is given by Eq. 7 where we put φint(L1 =
10−9 m2/s. The ion current

0) = φint(L2 = 1) = 0, R = R/L = 0.0004, and DK + = 2

through the nanochannel with no gradient of concentration (c0 = c1 = 0.01 M) depends on

both the depth of the potential well and on the degree of asymmetry of internal potential

φint (see Figures 3). For the ﬁxed depth of potential well φ(g) =

9 and diﬀerent values of

g (from 0.5 to 0.00001) we get various degrees of rectiﬁcation. It can be clearly seen that

∗

−

with increasing asymmetry (g

0) the I

V characteristic tends to a diode-like shape

−
(Fig. 3a). However the depth of potential well φ(g) is important as well. For the lower value

of φ(g) =

1 (Fig. 3b) we observe non-linear shape of I

V curve for both g = 0.5 and

−

g = 0.00001. For the asymmetric potential well the I

V characteristic shows asymmetry.

On the other hand, for the higher value of φ(g) =

9 (Fig. 3c) the diﬀerence between

symmetric and asymmetric case is much stronger. In Fig. 3c the I

V curve clearly shows

−

the rectiﬁcation (diode-like shape). The direction of the rectiﬁcation depends on the value

of g i.e. if it changes from 0.5 to 0.00001 or from 0.5 to 0.99999.

For the potential φint showed in Fig. 2a (where R = R/L = 0.004), the values of

line in Fig.4) the diﬀerence between them grows with increasing value of the potential well

In described-above cases we put c0 = c1. However the boundary condition φ(0)

Finally, let us analyze the diﬀerence between the potential well and the potential barrier

inside the channel. The cation that passes the negatively charged channel experiences po-

tential well, in the contrast the anion goes over the potential barrier. We can see that the

direction of the rectiﬁcation is diﬀerent in these two cases (Fig. 6). What is more important,

the current increases with the growth of the depth of the potential well, whereas the growth

of the height of the potential barrier results in dramatic decrease of the current (Fig. 6).

The main point is that these two cases (potential well and barrier) are not fully symmetric.

The contrast between these two cases leads us to the conclusion that the same electric ﬁeld

could cause enhancement of the cation current and inhibition of the anion current therefore

the resulting cation selectivity of the channel. However, it has been shown recently that

the selectivity of ionic channels may originate from physical mechanisms diﬀerent from the

electrostatics interactions, too [11].

IV. COMMENTS AND CONCLUSIONS

We found that the asymmetry of the internal potential φint coupled with the potential well

depth are suﬃcient for the rectiﬁcation observed as a diode-like shape of I

V characteristic.

−

The concentration gradient is not required for that eﬀect. However, in the absence of internal

potential φint(z)), the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz current equation, Eq. 6, gives ohmic curve

I

V if ∆c = 0 and non-ohmic shape if ∆c

= 0 [37]. In the latter case the deviation from

−

ohmic behavior results from the gradient of concentration on both sides of the channel and

is weakly non-linear. In our model, when we put ∆c = 0, the internal potential φint (with

the boundary values φint(0) = φint(1) = 0) is the source of asymmetry, and gives strong

non-linearity of I

V . Note that by varying these two factors the degree of the rectiﬁcation

can be intensiﬁed or diminished.

−

The conclusions are supported by the fact that we solve the Laplace’s equation instead of

the nonlinear Poisson-Boltzmann equation (see Appendix). It allows us to avoid a misleading

intuition that a nonlinear diode-like shape of I

V characteristics is caused by the non-

−

linearity of Poisson-Boltzmann equation. Apart from that, in general, it is not possible to

obtain an exact solution to the Nernst-Planck (NP) equation, coupled to the electric ﬁeld

by means of the Poisson-Boltzmann equation. The purpose of this paper is to show that

a simpliﬁed continuous model that makes use only of the electrical properties of the open

channel may support our intuitive knowledge of examined phenomenon.

Moreover, our understanding of the mechanisms which account for experimental obser-

vations will enable us to design both artiﬁcial biological and synthetic channels with desired

properties. Engineered nanopores may have signiﬁcant applications. The properties of

channels and pores that might be engineered include conductance, ion selectivity, gating

and rectiﬁcation, and inhibition by blockers [38]. This prospective additionally conﬁrms a

need for the theoretical models of nanopores.

The cylinder has a radius R and a height L, the top and bottom surfaces being at z = L

and z = 0. The surface charge density on the side of the cylinder is σ and we assume that is

symmetric about the axis of the cylinder, σ = σ(z). We want to ﬁnd potential at any point

inside the cylinder.

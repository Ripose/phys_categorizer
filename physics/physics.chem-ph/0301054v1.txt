Abstract

We report a new resummation procedure for the partial wave series (PWS)

representation of the scattering amplitude, when a basis set of Legendre poly-

nomials is used for the expansion. The eﬀect of the resummation is to remove

from the PWS the factor (α + β cos θ)−r where θ is the scattering angle, α and

β are constants and r = 1, 2, 3, ... . The resummed scattering amplitude is then

exactly decomposed into the sum of a nearside (N) subamplitude and a farside

(F) subamplitude. We make two applications of the NF resummed theory: to

elastic angular scattering in a strongly absorptive collision and to a state-to-state

diﬀerential cross section for the I + HI → IH + I reaction. In both applications,

we can understand the physical origin of structure in the angular scattering for

suitable choices of α, β and r.

I. INTRODUCTION

The Fuller nearside-farside (NF) theory of elastic angular scattering has been used for

more than 25 years to understand structure in the diﬀerential cross sections of nucleus-nucleus
collisions.1–6 More recently, it has been demonstrated that an extended NF theory is a powerful

tool for analysing structure in the angular scattering of elastic, inelastic and reactive atom-
molecule collisions.7–20

One advantage of NF theory is that the NF decomposition of the partial wave series (PWS) rep-

resentation for the scattering amplitude is exact. However, this exactness is no guarantee that

the NF procedure will always yield a physically meaningful explanation of structure in a diﬀer-

ential cross section. An example is elastic scattering in a strongly absorptive collision.15,16,21 It

has been shown in Refs. 15 and 16 that the failure of the NF method for this type of collision

can be overcome by resumming the PWS before applying the NF decomposition. The eﬀect of

the resummation is to extract from the PWS the factor (1 − cos θ)−r where r = 1, 2, 3, ... and

θ is the scattering angle.15,16

The purpose of this paper is to further develop (and apply) resummation theory for a PWS

which is expanded in a basis set of Legendre polynomials. In order to motivate our development,

we ﬁrst consider in section II a strongly absorptive elastic collision using a simple parameterized

scattering matrix element. We discuss an example where extracting the factor (1 − cos θ)−r

results in physically unrealistic N and F cross sections. We show for this example that the

correct factor to remove from the PWS is (1 + cos θ)−r. These considerations suggest that we

must extend our earlier work15,16 and resum a Legendre PWS in which the more general factor

(α + β cos θ)−r is extracted, where α and β are constants. This is done in section III, where we

also discuss properties of the resummed PWS. We apply our resummation theory in section IV

to analyse structure in the diﬀerential cross section of the state selected chemical reaction20,22

I + HI(vi = 0, ji = 4) → IH(vf = 0, jf = 4) + I

where vi, ji and vf , jf are initial and ﬁnal vibrational and rotational quantum numbers respec-

tively. Our conclusions are in section V.

II. ELASTIC SCATTERING IN A STRONGLY ABSORPTIVE COLLISION

This section reports and discusses PWS, N and F diﬀerential cross sections for a strongly

absorptive elastic collision. In particular, we examine how the N and F cross sections change

when the factor (α + β cos θ)−r, with r = 1, 2, 3, ... is removed from the PWS for two special

cases: (α, β) = (1, −1) and (α, β) = (1, 1).

A. Parameterized scattering matrix element

We use a simple two parameter analytic expression for the scattering matrix element, SJ ,

where J is the total (= orbital for this case) angular momentum quantum number, Λ locates

the absorbing surface in J space and ∆ measures the width of the surface region. The param-

eterization (2.1) has several advantages:15,16,21

• For appropriate values of Λ and ∆, the angular distribution can vary by many orders of

magnitude. This allows a systematic study to be made of the N and F angular scattering for

many values of r = 0, 1, 2, ... .

• Since SJ is real for J = 0, 1, 2, ..., (i.e. a purely absorbing collision) the N and F cross

sections are equal, which simpliﬁes the physical interpretation of the results.

• The analytic expression (2.1) is suﬃciently simple that the semiclassical limit of the PWS

can be worked out.21 This allows the N and F components of the scattering amplitude to be

unambiguously identiﬁed.21

We start with the PWS for the elastic scattering amplitude, f (θ), written in the form

about 34 signiﬁcant digits is necessary to generate the results in Figure 1 using a maximum

cut-oﬀ value of Jmax = 500. It can be seen that the PWS cross section possesses oscillations

over the whole angular range. Semiclassically, these oscillations arise from interference between

the N and F subamplitudes.21 The corresponding semiclassical N and F cross sections are os-

cillation free (not illustrated in Fig. 1, but displayed in Fig. 2a of Ref. 21). Figure 1 shows

that the angular range over which the NF subamplitudes (2.8) provide a physically meaningful

interpretation of the oscillations gets larger as r increases.16 The NF cross sections also con-

verge toward the semiclassical NF cross sections as r increases. The values (α, β) = (1, −1) are

therefore a satisfactory choice in the NF resummed theory. Some additional discussion of the

cross sections in Fig. 1 can be found in Refs. 15, 16 and 21.

J

is

a(0)
J = (2J + 1)(−1)J(SJ − 1),

J = 0, 1, 2, ...

(2.12)

and we again use Λ = 40, ∆ = 5 and (α, β) = (1, −1) in eqns (2.1) - (2.10), (2.12). Figure

2 shows that the PWS angular distribution is now backward peaked. Unfortunately, the NF

cross sections increasingly diverge for θ . 175◦ as r changes from r = 0 to r = 1, 2, 3, i.e. the

NF decomposition no longer provides a physically meaningful interpretation of the oscillations

in the PWS angular distribution for θ . 175◦.

The PWS cross section plotted in Fig. 2 is the reﬂection across θ = π/2 of the PWS curve

in Fig. 1. This property is a consequence of the identity (−1)J PJ (cos θ) = PJ (cos(π − θ)). The

same reﬂection property is also true for the r = 0 NF cross sections because (−1)J QJ (cos θ) =

−QJ (cos(π − θ)). These observations suggest that the correct factor to remove from the PWS

for the NF decomposition to be physically successfull is (1 − cos(π − θ))−r i.e. (1 + cos θ)−r. We

can again use the recurrence obeyed by cos θPJ (cos θ) to resum eqn (2.2) to remove the factor

(1 + cos θ)−r for θ 6= π. We ﬁnd that eqns (2.3), (2.4) and (2.8) are replaced by the following

Figure 3 shows the PWS and NF angular distributions when Λ = 40 and ∆ = 5 are used in

eqns (2.12) - (2.15) for r = 0, 1, 2, and 3 . It can be seen that, in contrast to Fig. 2, the NF

cross sections now provide a physically meaningful interpretation of the oscillations over an

increasingly wider angular range as r increases. In fact, Fig. 3 is just the reﬂection of Fig. 1

across θ = π/2.

The simple examples discussed in this section show that we must extend the resummation

theory developed in Refs. 15 and 16 in order to remove the general factor (α + β cos θ)−r from

III. RESUMMATION OF PARTIAL WAVE SERIES

In this section, we show how to resum a Legendre PWS so as to extract the general factor

(α + β cos θ)−r with r = 1, 2, 3, .... In the following manipulations, α and β can be complex

numbers, although in all our applications α and β are real. We also derive explicit formulae

for the coeﬃcients of the resummed series a(r)

assuming that α + β cos θ 6= 0):

to eqn (3.1) for r = 0.

• α 6= 0, β = 0. This case is trivial in that eqn (3.7) for r = 1, 2, 3, ... immediately reduces

• α = 0, β 6= 0. This case has the possible disadvantage for numerical work that the factor

(β cos θ)−r becomes singular as θ → π/2.

• α 6= 0, β 6= 0. For a given value of r, the denominator, (α + β cos θ)r, and the resummed

coeﬃcient, a(r)

J (α, β), are both homogeneous functions of α and β of degree r. This implies the

resummation theory can be developed in terms of the single parameter γ = α/β.

• The numerical value of f (θ), as given by eqn (3.7), is of course independent of the values

chosen for α, β and r. This allows a valuable check that the resummed coeﬃcients have been

correctly programmed on a computer.

• In our applications in sections II and IV, α and β are always chosen to be real (see also

Ref. 19). In addition, we require the condition α + β cos θ 6= 0 to hold not just at a single

angle, but for all θ ∈ (0, π). This implies the restriction |α| > |β|.

• For (α, β) = (1, −1), Wimp25 has used Wilf-Zeilberg algorithms to study the mathematical

properties of the a(r)

J (1, −1). He concluded that no simple closed form exists for them, i.e. their

evaluation requires the explicit calculations described in section III.B and in Ref. 16.

IV. ANGULAR SCATTERING FOR THE I + HI → IH + I REACTION

We have previously used20 the unresummed r = 0 NF theory to analyse angular scattering

for the state-to-state reaction

I + HI(vi = 0, ji 6 5) → IH(vf = 0, jf 6 5) + I

on the extended London-Eyring-Polanyi-Sato potential energy surface A of Manz and R¨omelt.26

We demonstrated that the r = 0 NF decomposition nearly always provides a physically

clear explanation of the forward, sideward and backward scattering.20 However, in a few cases,

the physical interpretation was obscured by the presence of oscillations in the N and F cross

sections at forward angles.20

An example is shown in Fig. 4 which displays PWS, N and F angular distributions for the

ji = jf = 4 transition at a total energy of E = 29.5 meV, where E = 0 meV corresponds

to the energy of HI(vi = 0, ji = 0). The scattering matrix elements calculated in Ref. 20

were used to generate Fig. 4. They were computed by a quantum method which applies a

Born-Oppenheimer type separation to the motion of the light and heavy atoms (a centrifugal

sudden approximation is also made).22

Note that Fig. 4 uses the reactive scattering angle θR along the abscissa, which is deﬁned

as the angle between the direction of the outgoing IH molecule and the incoming I atom. It is

related to the angle θ employed in section III by θR = π − θ.

The PWS for the reactive scattering amplitude is given by20,22

f (θR) = (2ik)−1

(2J + 1) ˜SJPJ (cos θR)

where ˜SJ = (−1)J SJ . [ n.b. in Refs. 20 and 22, ˜SJ is denoted SJ and in Ref. 22, θR is denoted

θ ]. The corresponding diﬀerential cross section is

(4.1)

(4.2)

In eqns (4.1) and (4.2), we have omitted the subscript vf jf ← vi ji from ˜SJ , f (θR) and I(θR),

as well as the subscript vi ji from k = 20.2 ˚A−1 in order to keep the notation simple, since we

I(θR) = |f (θR)|2

always have vi = 0, ji = 4 and vf = 0, jf = 4 in our calculations. The masses used are 1.008

u for the H atom and 126.9 u for the I atom. N and F resummed subamplitudes and cross

sections can also be deﬁned, which are the same as eqns (3.9) - (3.11) provided the changes

SJ → ˜SJ and θ → θR are made.

Figure 4 shows that the PWS angular distribution is N dominated for θR & 60◦. At smaller
angles, there are high frequency diﬀraction oscillations of period ∆θR ≈ 2.6◦ which arise from

NF interference. However, the N and F cross sections themselves possess oscillations of period

∆θR ≈ 5.2◦. A natural question to ask is: Are these oscillations artefacts of the r = 0 NF

decomposition or are they physically meaningful?

To begin to answer this question, we show in Fig. 5 the r = 1,2, and 3, NF and PWS angular

distributions using (α, β) = (1, −1) in the reactive analogs of eqns (3.9) - (3.11). The large

angle scattering stays N dominated, but in the forward angle region, the N and F cross sections

rapidly grow in magnitude; this growth becomes more pronounced as r increases from r = 1 to

r = 3. Unfortunately this behaviour is meaningless as a physical explanation of the diﬀraction

oscillations (even though the NF decompositions are mathematically exact). The blow up at

small angles can be understood from the identity16

where the sum is interpreted as 0 for r = 0. Equation (4.3) shows that the term 1 / (1−cos θR)s+1

for s = 0,1,2,..., r − 1 will give rise to increasingly divergent NF cross sections at small θR as

r increases, provided the a(s)

0 (1, −1) are not extremely small in magnitude. For the present

example, the values are

a(0)
0 = 0.0561 − 0.323 i

a(1)
0 (1, −1) = 0.103 − 0.648 i

a(2)
0 (1, −1) = 0.186 − 1.299 i

a(3)
0 (1, −1) = 0.334 − 2.601 i

Figure 6 and 7 show plots of Re a(r)

J (1, −1) versus J and Im a(r)

J (1, −1) versus J respectively

for r = 0,1,2 and 3. There is no apparent improvement in the convergence of the partial wave

series for the NF resummed subamplitudes; in fact the magnitudes of the a(r)

J (1, −1) become

In summary, we can say that the NF resummed theory using (α, β) = (1, −1) has not

improved the physical interpretation of the forward angle PWS diﬀraction oscillations - indeed

larger as r increases.

it has made matters worse.

Figure 8 shows plots for r = 1,2 and 3 of N, F and PWS diﬀerential cross sections using

(α, β) = (1.05, 1) in the reactive analogs of eqns (3.9) - (3.11). The N and F cross sections

are now oscillation free at forward angles and provide a clearer physical interpretation of the

diﬀraction oscillations as a NF interference eﬀect than does the r = 0 NF analysis. Figures

9 and 10 plot the real and imaginary parts respectively of a(r)

J (1.05, 1) versus J for r = 0,1,2

and 3. It can be seen that the magnitudes of the a(r)

J (1.05, 1) become smaller at low J as r

increases. For example, at J = 0 we have

a(0)
0 = 0.0561 − 0.323 i

a(1)
0 (1.05, 1) = 0.0123 − 0.0147 i

a(2)
0 (1.05, 1) = 0.00103 − 0.000103 i

a(3)
0 (1.05, 1) = 0.0000190 − 0.0000504 i

Figure 9 and 10 show that, in eﬀect, numerically signiﬁcant terms have been moved away

from low values of J to larger values of J. As discussed in Refs. 15, 16 and 19, this concen-

trating eﬀect, which emphasizes partial waves with J ≫ 1 as r increases, favours a physically
meaningful NF analysis because the Q(±)

J (cos θR) become travelling angular waves in this limit.

In particular, we have for J sin θR ≫ 1

Q(±)

J (cos θR) ∼ [2π(J +

) sin θR]−1/2 exp{±i[(J +

)θR −

π]}

Note that (1.05 + cos θR)−r approximately mimics the shape of I (θR) in that both are backward

peaked. This observation, together with the results discussed in section II, are examples of a

16

rule of thumb19 for choosing (α, β) so as to obtain physically meaningful N and F subamplitudes.

We have also calculated N and F resummed cross sections for some other values of (α, β).

For (α, β) = (1, 1), we obtained similar results to Figs. 8 - 10. One diﬀerence is a blowing up

of the N and F angular distributions at backward angles as r increases, which is similar to,

although less pronounced, than the eﬀect in the forward direction of Fig. 5. For (α, β) = (1.5,

1), our results are similar to those for (α, β) = (1.05, 1).

V. CONCLUSIONS

We have shown how to remove the factor (α + β cos θ)−r with r = 1,2,3... from a Legendre

PWS. We then decomposed the resummed PWS for the scattering amplitude into N and F

subamplitudes. Two applications of this NF resummed theory were reported: to elastic angular

scattering in a strongly absorptive collision and to a state-to-state diﬀerential cross section for

the I + HI → IH + I reaction. In both applications, by making suitable choices for (α, β) and

r, we were able to explain structure in the angular distributions.

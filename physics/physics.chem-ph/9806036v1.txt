OF FREE VOLUME IN COMPLEX LIQUIDS

Abstract. Recent progress on molecular theories of hydration of nonpolar
solutes in aqueous solution has led to new ways of thinking about the old
issue of free volume in liquids. This article surveys the principal new results
with particular attention to general issues of packing in liquids.

1. Introduction

Aqueous solutions of colloidal solutes are preeminent examples of complex
liquids. In such settings, attention is often directed towards the issues of
macromolecular structure, aggregation, and dynamics. However, one as-
pect of these problems is stubbornly associated with the small size scale
of molecules, in particular the small size of a water molecule. That prob-
lem is the molecular understanding and description of hydration eﬀects –
hydrophobic eﬀects – that stabilize membranes, micelles, folded proteins,
and aggregates of such structures. This presentation will focus on that ba-
sic, molecular scale issue underlying aqueous solutions of interest both to
biophysics and material science of colloids.

Because hydrophobic eﬀects are so broadly discussed, it might be sur-
prising to notice that workers on molecular theories of hydrophobic eﬀects
have not achieved good agreement on that molecular theory, at least when
we proceed beyond the primitive stage of the principles of statistical me-
chanics and speciﬁcation of the intermolecular interactions involved. The
empirical fact is that diﬀerent researchers hold diﬀerent opinions on the
correctness of several available theories, each of which agrees with a set of
experimental data at least roughly. A sampling of diﬀerent perspectives is

2

available from the references [1-33]; this collection is not intended to be
complete, however.

Furthermore, the simplest extensions of our experimental information
can spark new debates about our understanding of hydrophobic eﬀects.
A current example, the eﬀect of pressure on hydrophobic stabilization of
folded proteins, is discussed below.

In consequence of such observations, the theory surveyed here was de-
signed for maximal simplicity on the fundamentals of statistical mechanics
and on the physical assumptions applied to the particular problems. The
theory that was developed is relevant to the traditional packing problems
of theories of liquids and we emphasize that connection in the discussion
here.

A central problem for the theory of hydrophobic eﬀects is the old, but
imperfectly solved, theoretical problem of ﬁnding space for a solute in liquid
solvents. As is well recognized, liquids are dense, disordered materials. It is
this combination of attributes that makes these problems diﬃcult. The de-
scription of free volume in hard core model liquids is central to the modern
understanding of the van der Waals equation of state and is basic to such
ordering phase transitions as the hard sphere freezing and the liquid crystal
phase transitions [34]. In the speciﬁc motivating case considered here, the
particular molecular structuring characteristic of liquid water is expected
to be important. So we must preserve the ﬁdelity of the description of the
structure of liquid water, in addition to tackling the problem of packing in
dense, disordered materials.

This lecture develops a new conceptualization of this old problem and
new techniques for predicting the fractional free volume accessible to hard
core molecules in condensed phases. This new approach is based upon an in-
formation theory perspective that has general applicability and was initially
explicitly heuristic. Information was sought on a condensed medium of in-
terest and on that basis a prediction of the fractional free volume accessible
to a hard model solute was made. For some important cases considered so
far, the detail of information required for accurate, interesting predictions
has been surprisingly modest.

2. Free Volume Statistics

Consider the solubility of inert gases in aqueous solutions. The medium is
liquid water and the solute is idealized as a hard object, perfectly repelling
the center (oxygen atom) of each water molecule. For such models the
interaction part of the chemical potential of the solute is obtained as

β∆µ = − ln p0 ,

(1)

with p0 the probability that the hard solute could be inserted into the
system without overlap of van der Waals volume of the solvent; 1/β=kBT.
This is a specialization of Widom’s formula [35, 36]

exp{−β∆µ} = hexp{−β∆U }i0 .

∆U is the change in the solute-solvent interaction potential energy upon
placement of the solute in an arbitrary position in the solvent and the aver-
age indicated by h. . .i0 is over the thermal motion of the solvent unaﬀected
by the solute. The solute is a test particle for this calculation. For the hard
core model being considered, ∆U is either zero or inﬁnity, so the average
sought involves a random variable with value either one or zero; the av-
eraging collects the fraction of solute placements that would be allowed.
If presented with a thermal conﬁguration of a large volume of solvent, we
might estimate these quantities by performing many trial placements of the
solute throughout the solvent and determining the fraction of those trial
placements that would be allowed. This estimates Vf ree/V , the fractional
free volume accessible to the solute. Thus, Eq. (1) is a free volume formula
[37], exact for the model being considered.

The operation of these formulae can be viewed alternatively: Imagine
identifying a molecular scale volume at an arbitrary position in the liquid
system by (1) hypothetical placement of the solute and (2) determination
of those positions of water oxygen atoms that would be excluded due to
solute-solvent interactions. We will call this volume the observation volume.
With such a molecular scale volume deﬁned we could keep track, say during
a simulation calculation, of the probabilities pn that n = 0, 1, . . . oxygen
atom occupants are observed. As the notation suggests, p0 is the probability
that no occupants are observed in the molecular volume.

Our strategy for predicting of p0 will be to model the distribution pn
and to extract the extreme value p0. This is a primitive approach to theo-
ries of β∆µ and solubilities of inert gases water. Both more and less subtle
theoretical works on these topics have been long available. “Less subtle”
here means simulation calculations, techniques more straightforwardly use-
ful than many “more subtle” approaches. The “more subtle” means here
that further statistical quantities have been introduced for spherical solutes
with the intention that they might facilitate more expansive approximate
theories. These include

d1(λ) = −

G(λ) = (

λ is the radius of a center-to-center exclusion sphere. These quantities have
been useful in suggesting physical theories because they have interpreta-
tions that are appreciated physically. d1(λ), is the distribution function of
distances λ from an arbitrary point in the liquid to the nearest solvent cen-
ter. 4πλ2ρG(λ) [Eq. (4)] is, in view of Eq. (1), the derivative with respect to
exclusion radius of the hydration free energy due to intermolecular interac-
tions, in thermal energy units kBT. It gives the compressive force exerted
by the solvent on the hard spherical solute. In addition, 4πλ2ρG(λ)dλ is
the expected number of solvent centers in a shell of radius λ and width dλ
outside a hard sphere that excludes solvent centers from a ball of radius λ.

3. Simulation Results for Liquid Water

Some of the simulation work has determined the quantities of Eqs. (3) and
(4) for molecular liquids represented realistically at the current state-of-
the-art [14, 16]. Thus we know that d1(λ) for liquid water and for liquid n-
hexane are both unimodal with maximum displaced by a distance less than
0.1˚A; the maximum occurs at slightly smaller distances for liquid n-hexane
than for liquid water [14, 16]. This diﬀerence in the most probable cavity
size between liquid n-hexane and liquid water is not large. The diﬀerence in
the most probable cavity size between liquid water and a reference random
medium, with sites of the same radius and distributed randomly at the
water density, is greater than the diﬀerence between n-hexane and water.
So the diﬀerences observed between the two molecular liquids considered
are not purely reﬂections of molecular size and density. This comparison
addresses the idea that the low solubility of inert gases in liquid water
might be due to the small size of the water molecule and the possibility
that “interstitial” cavities would, on this basis, be smaller in water than
in the organic liquid [3, 38]. The fact that these diﬀerences between water
and n-hexane are slight is associated with the fact that the basic units
considered in n-hexane are the methyl and methylene groups. These are
not so diﬀerent in size from a water molecule. It should be noted also that
on a packing fraction basis, typical organic liquids are denser than liquid
water [6].

The notable distinction between the results for liquid water and liquid
n-hexane is that the distribution d1(λ) is narrower for liquid water. This
suggests that the liquid water phase is less ﬂexible than the liquid n-hexane
phase in opening cavities of substantial size.

Simulation calculations have also produced G(λ) for 0< λ <3.0˚A, ap-
proximately. This size range covers the simplest atomic solutes He and Ne
but not much more. This does, however, permit comparison between water
and organic solvents, and it permits comparison of available theories with

5

the simulation data. Thus for the range 2.0˚A< λ <3.0˚A, G(λ) for liquid
water is approximately two-times larger than for n-hexane. Water exerts a
higher compressive force on the surface of an inert solute than do typical
organic liquids; water squeezes-out hydrophobic solutes [39].

The checking of theories against the available simulation data G(λ) for
water has also been revealing [14, 16]. We now know that the predictions
of the scaled particle model [40, 41] are signiﬁcantly below the numerically
exact results for G(λ). The Pratt-Chandler (PC) integral equation theory
[42-44] predicts results for G(λ) that are signiﬁcantly too large. The more
pragmatic revised scaled particle model due to Stillinger [2] typically pre-
dicts G(λ) between those two theories and with some empiricism about
interpolation junctions can describe the available simulation data satisfac-
torily [14, 16]. For sizes λ ≫3.0˚A the available computer simulation data
are less extensive, the theories less convincing, and the checking has been
pursued less vigorously. See, however, the recent results of Reference [45].

4. Information Model

We now return to the theoretical program of predicting p0. What are the
standard theoretical tools for this? The most immediate guiding theory is
the ‘inclusion-exclusion’ development [46] of Eq. (2) [47, 48, 49]:

Figure 2. Virial expansion, notation as in Figure 1. Note that ‘virial’ often connotes
a low density expansion but here we are assuming full knowledge of the medium cor-
relation functions in the absence of the solute; δρ(2)(1, 2) = ρ(2)(1, 2) − ρ(2)(1)ρ(1)(2).
Thus from the perspective of a density expansion this organization shuﬄes the con-
tributions to the virial coeﬃcients. In fact, here contributions are ordered according
to the number of bonds attached to the root point. Successive contributions have a
structure that may be derived from that of familiar cumulants with the formal replace-
ment hnki0 → hn(n − 1) · · · (n − k + 1)i0; then p0 can be formally expressed as he−ni0.
See [52, 53, 54]. Table 1 gives formulae for contributions through 5th order.

Here the random variable n is the number of solvent centers within the ob-
servation volume and, e.g., hni0 is the expected number of centers within the
observation volume. Several important points can be made from Figure 1.
The ﬁrst is that the van der Waals approximation, the primordial free vol-
ume model, is obtained from the ﬁrst two terms shown β∆µ ≈ − ln[1−hni0].
The second point is direct and basic: p0 is naturally expressed in terms of
occupancy moments, indeed binomial moments here. The sum truncates
sharply for cases where a ﬁnite maximum number of particles can be present
in the observation volume. The sum can be of practical value in the van
der Waals case where only the ﬁrst nontrivial term is retained. For large
solute volumes or solvent densities, this sum is not directly useful; we seek
a way to exploit the same information but in a more broadly useful form.

The next most immediate theoretical guidance comes from the virial
expansion depicted in Figure 2. This can be considered a resummation
of the series Figure 1 and is better in the sense that such a truncation
cannot produce a negative probability as truncation of Figure 1 can do.
However, when that trouble is avoided Figure 2 can still be less compact
and truncations can be less accurate. For example, the van der Waals, single
term approximation to Figure 1 can be satisfactory and then Figure 2 with
a single term is likely to be less so.

Ultimately these considerations avoid the issue that we have only limited
information and we want to make the best prediction of p0 that we can.
When the problem is stated this way what to do next is clear: we model
the probabilities pn on an information theory basis. We consider a relative

where ˆpn represents a “default model” chosen heuristically. The moments
that enter into the series Figure 2, obtained from simulations if necessary,
are the information typically used. We then maximize this information en-

where the ζk are Lagrange multipliers to be adjusted so that the proba-

This is suggestive of the calculation of a partition function for a modest-
sized set of states with eﬀective interactions. The interesting questions then
involve the predictions extracted from the pj for properties other than the
given information. In our case, the property of ﬁrst interest is β∆µ.

We can make the comforting observation that use of only hni0 and the
natural default model ˆpj ∝ 1/j! produces the Poisson distribution as ex-
pected; ζ1 = − lnhni0 and β∆µ = hni0 as would be found by retaining only

Figure 3. Convergence of predictions for hydration free energy and information entropy
with numbers of binomial moments employed; ˆpj ∝ 1/j!. The moment information was
obtained from computer simulation of liquid water [58]. λ=3.0˚A. The ﬁlled (open) circles
use the left (right) scale.

Figure 3 shows how this prediction scheme works-out when the solvent
is computer simulated liquid water and the solute is a hard sphere of a size
appropriate for comparison with a Ne atom. The immediate point is that
a model based upon the two moments that might be obtained from experi-
ment, hni0 and hn(n − 1)i0, fortuitously provides the most satisfactory sim-
ple prediction of p0. The Poisson (one moment) model is not satisfactory.
Inclusion of moments higher than the second is not advantageous unless
several higher moments are available. The behavior of the information en-
tropy η suggests that the initial two moments do a good job of describing
the distribution and the subsequent higher moments are ‘uninformative.’

These points are further remarkable because recent analyses [56, 57]
have underscored the fact that Percus-Yevick approximate integral equa-
tions can be derived on the assumption that solvent density ﬂuctuations
are distributed according to a Gaussian probability functional. The results
of the present investigations, including particularly [56-59], give further in-
sight and support to those ideas. The PC approximate integral equation
theory of hydrophobic eﬀects [42], at its inception a Percus-Yevick ana-

h
9

logue, can be given a similar basis [56]. The PC theory is thereby given a
better foundation than was available at its genesis.

Note that present two-moment model is not precisely an assumption of
a Gaussian probability functional for a density ﬁeld. The occupancies here
are required to be nonnegative integers. That this be true of all subvolumes
of the observation volume is an important restriction.

cated order. The ﬁnal row gives the direct result obtained
from simulation [58].

That speciﬁcally binomial moments are involved in the series above
emphasizes the point that the occupancies must be nonnegative integers.
Further perspective on the convergence issue is obtained by examination
of successive contributions to the series Figure 2. Numerical results are
shown in Table 2. The ﬁrst and second order terms make a signiﬁcant
contribution but by themselves are not close to the full answer. The values of
the additional terms do not establish a rapid convergence to the known full
answer. However, we can view the information theory model as a technique
for reorganization of the series.

4.1. ENTROPY CONVERGENCE

When the typical occupation numbers n are large the granularity of the
distribution pn is expected to be less signiﬁcant, at least near the center
of the distribution and when viewed on a coarse enough scale. In such
circumstances the predictions of two-moment information theory models
are not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent than those of the PC theory. It is remarkable
that a simple calculation along these lines gives a convincing explanation of
the puzzling and contentious issue of “entropy convergence” in hydrophobic
hydration [60].

10

The phenomenon to be explained is the following: entropies of transfer
of non-polar molecules from gas phase or a non-polar solvent into water
converge at a temperature of about 400 K to approximately zero entropy
change. Similar behavior was also seen in the microcalorimetry experiments
on unfolding of several globular proteins. This behavior is insensitive to the
particular hydrophobic solute molecule. Since the entropy is a temperature
derivative of a hydration free energy, the convergence temperature identiﬁes
a region where graphs of hydration free energy versus temperature are ex-
tremal, in fact, maximal. Below that region the hydrophobic hydration free
energy increases with temperature but above that region the hydrophobic
hydration free energy decreases as the temperature is raised.

The two-moment information theory model above was applied to this
problem for hard sphere solutes in water with the heuristic modiﬁcation
that a ﬂat default model was used; ˆpj ∝ constant for j≤jmax and zero oth-
erwise. This latter adjustment was found empirically to give slightly better
hydration free energies. The results of the model and simulation calcula-
tions accurately agreed on the temperature dependence of the hydration
free energies. To analyze this agreement the information theory model was
simpliﬁed to a continuous Gaussian distribution that then gives

∆µ ≈

+ ln[2πhδn2i0]

)

(10)

(11)

v is the observation volume and ρsat(T ) is the liquid density along the vapor
saturation curve so that hni0 = ρsat(T )v. hδn2i0 was found to be insensi-
tive to temperature for the relevant conditions. Further, the ﬁrst term of
Eq. (11) is larger than the second. Thus the non-monotonic behavior of the
free energy with temperature and the entropy convergence is a consequence
of the non-monotonic variation of T ρsat(T )2 with temperature. The only
molecular parameter to complicate matters is the volume v and with this
formula v does not aﬀect the entropy convergence temperature [60]. Thus
the temperature of entropy convergence is about the same for a wide family
of solutes.

The physical point is: the entropy convergence phenomenon occurs for
water because of the low and temperature insensitive values of hδn2i0. In
fact, the isothermal compressibility of water at low pressure has a mini-
mum value at T=319 K. That temperature diﬀers substantially from the
observed entropy convergence temperatures but it is not necessary that
these temperatures be approximately equal, just that hδn2i0 be insensitive
to temperature in the region d[T ρsat(T )2]/dT ≈0.

The technical point of Eq. (10) is: this formula is simple and eﬀective
but how it is obtained from the series Figure 2 is not simple. Part of the

11

complication is that two additional twists have been interjected, the ﬂat
default model and the continuous approximation.

4.2. PRESSURE DENATURATION OF PROTEINS

It is a common view, based upon our current understanding, that hydropho-
bic eﬀects provide a nonspeciﬁc, cohesive stabilization of compact protein
structures. However, it has been argued [62] that our current understand-
ing of hydrophobic eﬀects is not consistent with the experimental facts of
pressure denaturation of globular proteins. The information theory model
of the previous section was applied also to study hydration free energies
and potentials of mean force (pmfs) for two and three hydrophobic spheri-
cal solutes in water as a function of pressure [63]. As is well known, those
pmfs exhibit contact and solvent-separated minima corresponding, respec-
tively, to cases where the hydrophobic spheres contact each other or where
a water molecule intervenes. It was found that increasing pressure shifted
the free energy balance of those two cases towards the solvent-separated
circumstance. This suggested an intercalation mechanism for pressure de-
naturation: as the pressure of the liquid is raised, water molecules are forced
into protein structure. A similar point of view can be taken of the formation
of clathrate hydrates at elevated pressures: at low pressure hydrophobic ef-
fects lead to close contacts and to clustering of hydrocarbon gases dissolved
in water. Pressure increases stabilize the crystalline phase that eliminates
close solute contacts. If attention is focused on the hydrocarbon material
this behavior might seem counter-intuitive because the hydrocarbon mate-
rial seems to expand. But the thermodynamic principle is that increasing
pressure stabilizes the phase of lower volume. Therefore, we conclude that
the system may be packed more eﬃciently and have a lower total volume
when water molecules are intercalated into the hydrocarbon clusters. These
topics will surely be the subject of further research.

5. Concluding Comments

Identiﬁcation of some generalizations and future directions for these theo-
ries will provide concluding comments. Firstly, we note that the generaliza-
tion of these ideas to treat continuous, rather than only hard core repulsive,
solute-solvent interactions is known [64].

Secondly, we note the importance in the context of the aqueous solu-
tions of our restriction here to small molecule solutes. It is well recognized
that treatment of larger solutes requires consideration of the multiphasic
character of these solutions on large length scales [2, 58, 63]. For large
enough hard sphere solutes dissolved in water close to phase coexistence,
the possibility that the solvent will pull away from the solute surface re-

12

quires speciﬁc attention. Further subtleties arise when the solute-solvent
interactions are not just repulsive but include attractive interactions too
[65, 66]. These issues will surely be the subject of further research in the
area of hydrophobic eﬀects. It seems likely that an appropriately designed
default model should be able to describe such eﬀects in a physical manner.

Thirdly, we note that these approaches provide some unanticipated an-
swers [64] to questions such as “How is water diﬀerent from hydrocarbon
liquids as a solvent for nonpolar solutes?” The importance of the low and
temperature insensitive values of the isothermal compressibility of liquid
water is noteworthy. However, such answers are not in the format that is
most often intended when such questions are asked. Most often such ques-
tions solicit information about particular patterns of solvent structure in
the neighborhood of a hydrophobic solutes. Some groundwork has been laid
for consideration of those detailed structural issues in a format consistent
with the discussion of this paper [67]. Pursuit of answers about the detailed
structural issues and their relevance to hydrophobic eﬀects will surely be
the subject of future research.

Finally, we note again the relevance of these ideas to the classic problems
of packing in liquids. The importance of these issues is reﬂected in the
signiﬁcance of the hard sphere ﬂuid system to our understanding of liquids.
Hard core model systems may not be directly realistic. But it continues to
surprise that when attention is directed to new physical problems, e.g. the
thermodynamics and structure of glasses or folded proteins, understanding
of basic packing problems is again requested. Such problems surface quite
broadly [66-72]. It would be interesting to see the ordering phase transitions
associated with packing problems, crystallization and liquid crystallization,
analyzed on these bases. An initial step along such lines for the hard sphere
ﬂuid has been taken [75] but more work is deserved.

We hasten to add that the results so far have not superseded previous
theoretical results. But this new approach oﬀers the possibility of better,
more physical understandings of packing problems in the equilibrium sta-
tistical mechanics of non-crystalline materials and the previous theories of
them. This approach has achieved new understanding for the problems of
primitive hydrophobic eﬀects. By exploiting information external to con-
ventional theories, even simulation data, and by proposing a pattern for
utilizing that information, these approaches begin to respond to Ander-
sen’s [76] request for a ‘theory of theories.’

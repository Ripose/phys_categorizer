Abstract

A long-standing controversy concerning the heat of formation of methylen-

imine has been addressed by means of the W2 (Weizmann-2) thermochemical

approach. Our best calculated values, ∆H ◦

f,298(CH2NH)=21.1±0.5 kcal/mol

and ∆H ◦

f,298(CH2NH+

2 )=179.4±0.5 kcal/mol, are in good agreement with the

most recent measurements but carry a much smaller uncertainty. As a by-

product, we obtain the ﬁrst-ever accurate anharmonic force ﬁeld for methylen-

imine: upon consideration of the appropriate resonances, the experimental

gas-phase band origins are all reproduced to better than 10 cm−1. Consid-

eration of the diﬀerence between a fully anharmonic zero-point vibrational

energy and B3LYP/cc-pVTZ harmonic frequencies scaled by 0.985 suggests

I. INTRODUCTION

Methylene imine (methanimine, formaldimine, CH2=NH) is a pyrolysis product of amines

[1] as well as a photolysis product of methylazide [2] and diazomethane [3]. It has obvious

chemical importance as the simplest imine [4], and with its carbon-nitrogen double bond,

methylenimine is a bonding paradigm for numerous nitrogen-containing heterocycles. The

molecule is also of astrophysical interest, having been detected in dark interstellar dust clouds

[5].

The heat of formation of methylenimine (methanimine, formaldimine, CH2=NH), is the

subject of a long-standing controversy in the literature. Experimental values for the heat of

formation (∆H ◦

f ) of this molecule span a range of 10 kcal/mol, and have fairly large experi-

mental uncertainties (about 2 to 3 kcal/mol). The ﬁrst experiment, by DeFrees and Hehre

in 1978, [6] used the bracketing method to evaluate the hydride aﬃnity of HCNH+, and

hence derived ∆H ◦

f,298[CH2=NH]=26.4±3.2 kcal/mol. Ten years later, Grela and Colussi [7]

obtained a value of 25±3 kcal/mol from the deprotonation reaction of CH3NH. A Moscow

group had meanwhile obtained [8] 21±4 kcal/mol by photoionization mass spectrometry of

pyrolysis products of azetidine.

In 1990, Peerboom, Ingemann, Nibbering, and Liebman

(PINL) [9] bracketed the proton aﬃnity (PA) of CH2NH as 204±2 kcal/mol by means of ion

cyclotron resonance: in combination with an earlier determination of the heat of formation

of CH2NH+

2 (177–178 kcal/mol) by Lossing et al. [10] from appearance energy measure-

ments, they obtained ∆H ◦

f,298[CH2=NH]=16.5±2 kcal/mol. Then in 1992, Holmes et al.

[11] determined the ionization potential of the CH2NH radical by means of energy-resolved

electron impact, and derived an upper limit of 22±3 kcal/mol for ∆H ◦

f,298[CH2=NH]: they

propose an ‘evaluated’ ∆H ◦

f,298[CH2=NH]=21±4 kcal/mol, which happens to be identical to

the Moscow group value. Around the same time, Smith, Pople, Curtiss, and Radom (SPCR)

[12] carried out a computational study in which reaction energies for ten reactions involving

CH2NH were computed by means of G2 theory [13]: in combination with experimental data

for the auxiliary species [14], they obtained ∆H ◦

f,298=20.6±2.4 kcal/mol averaged over the

3

ten reactions. Although this is in good agreement with the Holmes et al. experiment, the

error bars are still a far cry from ‘chemical accuracy’ (1 kcal/mol).

Very recently, two of us proposed [15] two new computational thermochemistry methods

known as W1 and W2 (Weizmann-1 and Weizmann-2) theory which, for molecules domi-

nated by dynamical correlation, yield heats of formation to within 0.25 kcal/mol (1 kJ/mol)

accuracy, on average. A subsequent validation study [16] for a much larger data set came to

similar conclusions. Since CH2NH is still small enough for a W2 calculation to be carried

out on fast workstation computers, this would appear to be the tool of choice for resolving

the controversy on its heat of formation for once and for all. This is the primary purpose of

the present paper.

As a by-product, we shall obtain an accurate ab initio anharmonic force ﬁeld for CH2NH.

(For the highest possible accuracy, it is in principle advisable to obtain the molecular zero-

point vibrational energy ZPVE from an anharmonic force ﬁeld rather than from scaled

harmonic frequencies.) Aside from matrix isolation work [2,17], a respectable amount of

high-resolution IR data is available for this molecule. Following early high-resolution work

by Johnson and Lovas [18], Allegrini et al. [19] obtained a high-resolution ν4 by CO laser

Stark spectroscopy. Duxbury and Le Lerre [20] studied the ν5 and ν6 bands by Fourier

transform IR (FTIR) spectroscopy, including an analysis of the Coriolis interaction (along

the c axis) between those modes. The ν7, ν8, and ν9 modes, as well as the strong Coriolis

interactions between them, were studied by Halonen and Duxbury [21], while these same

authors studied ν2 and the (ν3,2ν5) Fermi resonant band pair in a companion paper [22] and

reported ν1 elsewhere [23].

General harmonic force ﬁelds were derived by Jacox and Milligan [17], by Hamada et al.

[24] and by Halonen, Deeley, and Mills [25]: the latter authors also remeasured and rean-

alyzed the (ν7, ν8, ν9) triad. (A microwave substitution structure was obtained by Pearson

and Lovas [26].) To the authors’ knowledge, the only anharmonic force ﬁeld available is

a comparatively low-level (MP2/6-311G**) ab initio calculation by Pouchan and Zaki [27].

Extensive experience has shown (e.g. [28] and references therein) that the CCSD(T) (coupled

4

cluster with all single and double substitutions [29] and a quasiperturbative correction for

connected triple excitations [30]) electron correlation method in conjunction with a basis set

of spdf quality generally yields computed fundamentals within better than 10 cm−1 of the

observed gas-phase values. Thus, obtaining a force ﬁeld of such quality is the secondary

purpose of the present note.

II. COMPUTATIONAL METHODS

Geometry optimizations and vibrational frequency calculations using the B3LYP (Becke

3-parameter-Lee-Yang-Parr [31,32]) density functional method have been carried out using

Gaussian 98 revision A7 [33]. All other calculations were carried out using MOLPRO 98.1

[34], and a driver for the W1/W2 calculations [35] written in MOLPRO’s scripting language,

running on Compaq XP1000 and Compaq ES40 computers in our research group.

W1 and W2 theory are described in detail elsewhere [15,16]. Brieﬂy, both methods involve

separate extrapolations to the inﬁnite-basis limit, using a sequence of Dunning correlation

consistent [36,37] (cc-pVnZ) and augmented correlation consistent [38] (aug-cc-pVnZ) basis

sets, of the SCF, CCSD valence correlation, and (T) valence correlation energies. In addi-

tion, contributions of inner-shell correlation and (Darwin and mass-velocity [39,40]) scalar

relativistic eﬀects are obtained at the CCSD(T) and ACPF (averaged coupled pair functional

[41]) levels with the MTsmall basis set [15]. While the more economical W1 theory uses a

B3LYP/cc-pVTZ reference geometry and extrapolates from aug′-cc-pVnZ (n=D,T,Q) basis

sets, the more expensive (and rigorous) W2 theory employs a CCSD(T)/cc-pVQZ reference

geometry and aug′-cc-pVnZ (n=T,Q,5) basis sets.

(Regular cc-pVnZ basis sets are used

throughout on hydrogen.) In addition, we considered W1h and W2h results, where the ‘h’

(for ’hetero-atom’) indicates that augmented basis sets are only used on group V, VI, and

VII elements and not on group III and IV elements.

The largest basis set CCSD calculations in W2 and W2h theory were carried out using

the direct CCSD implementation [42] of Lindh, Sch¨utz, and Werner as present in MOLPRO

98.1. All energies for the open-shell separated atoms were obtained using the restricted

5

open-shell CCSD(T) energy as deﬁned in Ref. [43].

For comparison, we shall also present data for the isoelectronic C2H4 and N2H2 molecules.

A complete CCSD(T)/cc-pVTZ quartic force ﬁeld for CH2NH was generated in internal

coordinates (four stretches, three bends, two torsions). Internal coordinate geometries were

generated by recursive application of the central diﬀerence formula to the coordinates being

diﬀerentiated, with step sizes of 0.01 ˚A or radian around the minimum energy geometry being

used. Cartesian coordinates for this ‘grande list’ of points were generated using INTDER [44]:

this list of geometries was reduced to a ‘petite list’ of unique points by means of comparison

of sorted distance matrices. Thus, 2241 points in Cs symmetry and 460 additional points

in C1 symmetry are obtained. Since this type of application is a textbook example of an

‘embarrassingly parallel’ [45] computational problem, the energy calculations were carried

out on a 26-node experimental PC-farm at the Department of Particle Physics, Weizmann

Institute of Science. In order to minimize roundoﬀ error in the ﬁnite diﬀerentiation, integral

evaluation cutoﬀs as well as SCF and CCSD convergence criteria were tightened such that the

energies are obtained to essentially machine precision. Quartic contamination was removed

from the quadratic force constants. The ﬁnal internal coordinate force ﬁeld was transformed

to Cartesian coordinates using INTDER, and transformed to normal coordinates as well as

subjected to a standard second-order rovibrational perturbation theory (VIB-PT2) analysis

[46] using SPECTRO [47] and POLYAD [48].

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

A. Anharmonic force ﬁeld

A plethora of resonances exists involving the three XH stretching modes ν1, ν2, ν3 on the

one hand and two-quantum states within the ν4, ν5, ν6 block on the other hand (the modes

involved are the CN stretch, the HNC bend, and the HCH scissoring mode, respectively).

For this reason, we deperturbed the anharmonic constants for all resonances of the type

νx ≈ νy + νz (where x={1,2,3} and y,z={4,5,6}, e.g. ν2 ≈ ν4 + ν6 or ν3 ≈ 2ν5), and set up

6

and diagonalized a 9×9 resonance matrix involving all these states. (Formulas for the various

higher-order resonance matrix elements were taken from Ref. [49].) The resonance matrix

and its eigensolution are given in Table I, while the computed harmonic frequencies and

fundamentals (as well as any bands in resonance with them) are given in Table II, compared

with experiment and with results from the previous lower-level (MP2/6-311G**) calculation

by Pouchan and Zaki [27]. A complete force ﬁeld and sets of spectroscopic constants are

available as supplementary material to the present paper.

First of all, as readily seen from the solution of the 9 × 9 resonance matrix, the ν3 ≈ 2ν5

resonance is so severe that the two perturbed states are basically 50:50 mixtures of the

respective deperturbed states, and that an assignment of an observed band to either ν3 or

2ν5 is somewhat academic. Similar remarks apply to the ν2 ≈ ν4 + ν6 resonance:

in both

cases, the assignments in the table were made based on the ordering of the deperturbed

states. The ν1 ≈ 2ν4 resonance is also quite severe but an unambiguous assignment is still

possible there. (For a system like this, a full nine-dimensional solution by variational methods

[50] or high-order canonical Van Vleck perturbation theory [51] would certainly be helpful:

this is however beyond the scope of the present study since we are primarily interested in

the thermochemistry.)

This being said, agreement between computed and observed vibrational band origins is

basically as good as we can reasonably expect at this level of theory, with all computed-

observed discrepancies lying below 10 cm−1. The very good agreement between the present

band origins and the earlier lower-level results is somewhat fortuitous, given the discrepancies

of up to 50 cm−1 between the two sets of harmonic frequencies. It has been our experience

that MP2 computed anharmonicities for XH stretching modes tend to be seriously overesti-

mated, and the present system forms no exception.

The only experimental equilibrium geometry available from the literature is a microwave

(rs) substitution structure [26]. Agreement between our calculations and the rs geometry

is as good as we can reasonably expect (Table III). The eﬀect of correlating the (1s)-like

inner-shell electrons on the geometry follows expected trends [52] (Table III). (The MTsmall

7

core correlation basis set [15] as used in W1 and W2 theory was employed for this purpose.)

No experimental re or rz geometry is available, but an indirect measure of the quality of

our computed CCSD(T)/MTsmall geometry can be obtained by substituting it in the VIB-

PT2 analysis and comparing the ground-state rotational constants thus obtained with their

precisely known [21] experimental counterparts. Our computed A0=6.54242, B0=1.15615,

C0=0.97936 cm−1 agree to better than 0.1% with the observed values [21] 6.544896(1),

1.1555459(1), and 0.9790851(1) cm−1: given the quadratic dependence of the rotational

constants on the geometry, this in fact suggests an even better agreement between the

underlying computed re geometry and Nature. In order to assist future experimental work

on the protonated species CH2NH+

2 , we have computed its geometry at the same level (Table

cm−1.

Let us ﬁnally turn to the zero-point vibrational energy (ZPVE). Our computed value from

the CCSD(T)/cc-pVTZ quartic force ﬁeld, and including the E0 correction, is 24.69 kcal/mol.

As seen in Table IV, this diﬀers by no more than 0.10 kcal/mol from the zero-point correction

used in W1 theory, i.e. B3LYP/cc-pVTZ harmonic frequencies scaled by 0.985. The same

remark holds true (Table IV) for the isoelectronic molecules C2H4 (diﬀerence +0.04 kcal/mol)

and trans-HNNH (diﬀerence +0.03 kcal/mol), for which large basis set CCSD(T) quartic

force ﬁelds are available from previous work [53,54]. There are certainly situations (e.g.

nonrigid molecules — i.e. those exhibiting low-barrier internal rotations and/or inversions,

or very low frequency modes — or very anharmonic systems such as H +

3 ) where anything

less than an anharmonic force ﬁeld is fundamentally inappropriate for the zero-point energy.

Yet it would appear to be that the immensely less expensive scaled harmonic B3LYP ZPVE

is appropriate even for benchmark work: any situation where accuracy of ±0.1 kcal/mol on

8

the computed atomization energy is essential is presently beyond direct treatment even by

W2 theory.

B. Heat of formation

Total atomization energies (TAEe if zero-point exclusive, TAE0 at 0 K) at the W1, W1h,

W2, and W2h levels for CH2NH, CH2NH+

2 , trans-HNNH, and C2H4 are given in Table IV,

together with a breakdown by components of the results at the highest level of theory (W2).

In the light of our observation above, and in order to achieve consistency among the

species considered (including CH2NH+

2 , for which no anharmonic force ﬁeld is available),

all heats of formation reported in Table IV use the scaled B3LYP ZPVEs rather than their

anharmonic counterparts.

At the highest level of theory, we obtain ∆H ◦

f,298(CH2NH)=21.1 kcal/mol. The W2h

result is essentially identical; the W1 and W1h results are slightly diﬀerent, but still by less

than 0.2 kcal/mol.

In the original W2 paper [15], the mean absolute error for a sample

of some 30 very accurately known total atomization energies was 0.23 kcal/mol; we shall

conservatively take our error bar to be twice that amount, or (after roundoﬀ) ±0.5 kcal/mol.

Our calculation stays below the Holmes et al. upper limit and is in excellent agreement

with both the Holmes et al. evaluated ∆H ◦

f,298and the G2-thermodynamic cycle derived

value of SPCR: of course, our error bar is an order of magnitude smaller than the former

and several times smaller than the latter.

What is the source of the 5 kcal/mol disagreement between these values and the earlier

PINL measurement? In order to shed light upon this question, we calculated the heat of

formation of protonated methylenimine, and hence also the PA of the latter compound. At

the W1 and W2 levels, we ﬁnd PA(CH2NH)=207.8 and 207.5 kcal/mol, respectively: this

is a minor exception to the rule [16] that W1 and W2 theory yield essentially identical

proton aﬃnities. Our W2 PA is 3.5 kcal/mol higher than the bracketed value of 204±2

kcal/mol, but lies within the error bar of the very recent Bouchoux and Salpin [55] value,

206.2±1.5 kcal/mol, obtained by the thermokinetic method. [56] We note that the accuracy

9

of the bracketing is, by its very nature, in turn dependent on the accuracy of the PAs of

the bases involved in the bracketing experiments. For the ﬁve bases used, namely pyrrole,

diisopropyl ether, ammonia, styrene, and diethyl ether, the PA values from the 1988 Lias et

al. compilation [57] employed by PINL diﬀer by up to 2.5 kcal/mol from the more recent

1998 compilation of Hunter and Lias [58].

As for the heat of formation of CH2NH+

2 , our computed W1 and W2 values are 1.0

and 1.4 kcal/mol higher, respectively, than the value of Lossing et al. [10] used by PINL.

Hammerum and Sølling (HS) [59] recently re-evaluated the experimental data of Lossing et

al., using the 298 K enthalpy contributions of Traeger and McLoughlin [60] to convert the

reported threshold energy measurements into heats of formation at 298 K. In this manner,

the value found for methylenimine is 179.7 kcal/mol, in excellent agreement with our W2

calculated result of 179.4±0.5 kcal/mol. HS also calculated the heat of formation of CH2NH+
2

at the G2(MP2) and CBS-Q levels, and found 179.0 and 180.2 kcal/mol, respectively. For

CH2NH, the corresponding values are 20.8 and 22.0 kcal/mol; agreement with our W1 and

W2 values is as good as can reasonably be expected for the G2(MP2) and CBS-Q methods.

W2 is most reliable for molecules that are dominated by dynamical correlation energy.

One index which we found to be very reliable for this purpose is the percentage of the binding

energy that is recovered at the SCF level. For CH2NH this is found to be 70%, which is

closer to C2H4 (77%) and to molecules essentially devoid of nondynamical correlation at

their equilibrium geometry (e.g. water, H2) than to trans-HNNH (52%, comparable to N2)

which is in a regime of moderate nondynamical correlation. For CH2NH+

2 , SCF accounts for

about 63% of the binding energy.

Interestingly, the reaction

is computed to be exergonic by about 9 kcal/mol. At the SCF level, this is even slightly

larger: electron correlation reduces the diﬀerence by about 1.1 kcal/mol. For comparison,

the reaction

is exergonic by 6.7 kcal/mol [61], while

IV. CONCLUSIONS

(2)

(3)

We have calculated benchmark heats of

formation of methylenimine and pro-

tonated methylenimine by means of W2 theory.

Our best

calculated values,

∆H ◦

f,298(CH2NH)=21.1±0.5 kcal/mol and ∆H ◦

f,298(CH2NH+

2 )=179.4±0.5 kcal/mol, are in

good agreement with the most recent measurements but carry a much smaller uncertainty.

As such, they resolve a long-standing experimental controversy.

As for many other systems, the diﬀerence between a fully anharmonic ZPVE (zero-point

vibrational energy) and a simple B3LYP/cc-pVTZ calculation scaled by 0.985 is negligible

for our purposes.

(x, y=4,5,6).

A ﬁrst-ever high-quality quartic force ﬁeld for CH2NH has been made available. Agree-

ment with experimental high-resolution IR data is better than 10 cm−1. Reliable band origins

for the stretching modes require diagonalization of a 9 × 9 resonance polyad involving νx + νy

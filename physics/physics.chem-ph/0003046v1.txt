Abstract

A complete theoretical model of the nuclear spin conversion in 13CH3F in-

duced by intramolecular ortho-para state mixing is proposed. The model

contains parameters determined from the level-crossing spectra of the 13CH3F

spin conversion. This set of parameters includes the ortho-para decoherence

rate, the magnitude of the hyperﬁne spin-spin interaction between the molec-

ular nuclei and the energy gap between the mixed ortho and para states.

These parameters are found to be in a good agreement with their theoretical

estimates.

I. INTRODUCTION

The study of nuclear spin isomers of molecules was started by the discovery of the

ortho and para hydrogen in the late 1920’s [1]. It became clear already in that time that

many other symmetrical molecules should have nuclear spin isomers too. Nevertheless,

their investigation has been postponed by almost 60 years. The reason for this delay was

severe diﬃculties in the enrichment of spin isomers. The situation is improving now (see

the review in Ref. [2]) but yet we are at the very early stage of this research:

in addition

to the well-known spin isomers of H2 only a few molecules have been investigated so far.

Among them, the CH3F nuclear spin isomers occupy a special place being the most studied

and understood.

The conversion of CH3F nuclear spin isomers has been explained [3,4] in the framework

of quantum relaxation [5]. which is based on the intramolecular ortho-para state mixing

and on the interruption of this mixing by collisions. This mechanism of spin conversion has

a few striking features. The nuclear spin states of CH3F appeared to be extremely stable
surviving 109 − 1010 collisions. Each of the collision changes the energy of the molecule
by 10 − 100 cm−1 and shuﬄes the molecular rotational state substantially. Nevertheless,
the model predicts that the spin conversion is governed by tiny intramolecular interactions
having the energy ∼ 10−6 cm−1.

Under these circumstances, the validity of the proposed theoretical model should be

checked with great care. This is especially important because the CH3F case gives us the

ﬁrst evidence of the new mechanism behind the nuclear spin conversion in molecules. Hy-

drogen spin conversion, which is the only other comprehensively studied case, is due to the

completely diﬀerent process based on direct collisional transitions between ortho and para

states of H2.

Presently there is substantial amount of the experimental data on CH3F isomer conver-

sion (see [2] and references therein). Theory and experiment on the CH3F isomer conversion

were compared in a number of papers but these comparisons were never aimed to determine

a complete set of parameters necessary for a quantitative description of the process. The

purpose of the present paper is to construct such self-consistent theoretical model of the

CH3F isomer conversion.

2

II. QUANTUM RELAXATION

The CH3F molecule is a symmetric top having the C3v symmetry. The total spin of the

three hydrogen nuclei in the molecule can be equal to I = 3/2 (ortho isomers), or I = 1/2

(para isomers). The values of the molecular angular momentum projection on the molecular

symmetry axis (K) are speciﬁc for these spin isomers. Only K divisible by 3 are allowed

for the ortho isomers. All other K are allowed for the para isomers. Consequently, the

rotational states of CH3F form two subspaces which are shown in Fig. 1 for the particular

case of the 13CH3F molecules.

Let us brieﬂy recall the physical picture of the CH3F spin conversion by quantum re-

laxation. Suppose that a test molecule was placed initially in the ortho subspace of the

molecular states (Fig. 1). Due to collisions in the bulk the test molecule will undergo fast

rotational relaxation inside the ortho subspace. This running up and down along the ortho

ladder proceeds until the molecule reaches the ortho state m which is mixed with the para
state n by the intramolecular perturbation ˆV . Then, during the free ﬂight just after this
collision, the perturbation ˆV mixes the para state n with the ortho state m. Consequently,

the next collision is able to move the molecule to other para states and thus to localize it

inside the para subspace. Such mechanism of spin isomer conversion was proposed in the

theoretical paper [6].

The quantum relaxation of spin isomers can be quantitatively described in the framework

of the kinetic equation for density matrix [3]. Let us consider ﬁrst a free molecule which is

not subjected to an external ﬁeld. One needs to split the molecular Hamiltonian into two

parts

ˆH = ˆH0 + ¯h ˆV ,

(1)

where the main part of the Hamiltonian, ˆH0, has pure ortho and para states as the eigen-
states; the perturbation ˆV mixes the ortho and para states. In the ﬁrst order perturbation

theory the nuclear spin conversion rate, γ, is given by

(Wp(α′) + Wo(α)) ,

(2)

γ = Xα′∈p,α∈o

2Γα′α|Vα′α|2
Γ2
α′α + ω2

α′α

3

where Γα′α is the decay rate of the oﬀ-diagonal density matrix element ρα′α (α′ ∈ para; α ∈
ortho); ¯hωα′α is the energy gap between the states α′ and α; Wp(α′) and Wo(α) are the

Boltzmann factors of the corresponding states. The parameters Γα′α, Vα′α, and ωα′α are

crucial for the quantitative theoretical description of the 13CH3F spin isomer conversion.

All previous comparisons between the experiment on the CH3F spin conversion and the

theory were performed using “total” rates of conversion which summarize all contributions

to the rate from many ortho-para level pairs. The “total” rate is just a single number and

obviously cannot provide unambiguous determination of all parameters which are present in

the expression (2). One may combine the experimental data on “total” rates with theoretical

calculations of some parameters but it is not easy. In this case one has to perform extensive

calculations of the intramolecular ortho-para state mixing. Even more diﬃcult is to calculate

the decoherence rates Γα′α. Consequently, development of the self-consistent model of the

nuclear spin conversion in which all parameters are unambiguously determined should be

based on a diﬀerent approach.

III. LEVEL–CROSSING RESONANCES

Theoretical model of spin conversion predicts strong dependence of the conversion rate,

γ, on the level spacing ωα′α (see Eq. (2)). This can be used to single out the contribution

to the conversion from each level pair which should substantially simplify the quantitative

comparison between theory and experiment. It was proposed in [7] and performed in [8] to

use the Stark eﬀect for crossing the ortho and para states of CH3F. These crossings result in

sharp increase of the conversion rate γ giving the conversion spectra if electric ﬁeld is varied.

The experimental data [8] are presented in Fig. 2. It is evident that such spectrum contains

much more information than the ”total” conversion rate which is just a single number.

Comparison of the conversion spectrum in Fig. 2 with the theory needs a modiﬁcation of

the model in order to incorporate the Stark eﬀect. Homogeneous electric ﬁeld lifts partially

the degeneracy of the α-states of CH3F (see Appendix). The new states, µ-basis, can be

found in a standard way [9]:

|µ > ≡ |β, ξ > |σF > |σC >; ξ = 0, 1.

(3)

4

Because electric ﬁeld in the experiment is relatively small, it is suﬃcient to consider only

diagonal matrix elements of the Stark perturbation over angular momentum J when calcu-

lating the µ-states. Energy of the µ-states are given by the expression

E(µ) = Ef ree(J, K) + (−1)ξ K|M|

J(J + 1)|dE|,

(4)

where Ef ree(J, K) is the energy of free molecule; d is the molecular permanent electric dipole
moment; E is the electric ﬁeld strength. The new states are still degenerate with respect to
the spin projections σ, σF , and σC, and to the sign of M. An account of the Stark eﬀect

in the spin conversion model is straightforward. Eq. (2) should be rewritten in the µ-basis

with the level energies determined by the Eq. (4).

IV. FITTING OF THE EXPERIMENTAL DATA

Nuclear spin conversion in 13CH3F at zero electric ﬁeld is governed almost completely

by mixing of only two level pairs (J′=11, K′=1)–(J=9, K=3) and (21,1)–(20,3) [4,10]. The

spectrum presented in Fig. 2 is produced by crossings of the M-sublevels of the para (11,1)

and ortho (9,3) states. This pair of states is mixed by the spin-spin interaction between

the molecular nuclei [4]. There is no contribution to the mixing of this level pair from the
spin-rotation interaction because of the selection rule for spin-rotation interaction |∆J| ≤ 1
[11]. This is fortunate because the spin-spin interaction can be calculated rather accurately.

Contrary to that, the spin-rotation interaction in CH3F is known only approximately. For

more details on spin-rotation contribution to the CH3F spin conversion see Refs. [11–15]

The second pair of ortho-para states (21,1)–(20,3), which is also important for the spin

conversion in 13CH3F at zero electric ﬁeld, is mixed by both the spin-spin and spin-rotation

interactions. The magnitude of the latter is presently unknown. Nevertheless,

it does

not complicate the ﬁtting procedure because in the vicinity of the (11,1)–(9,3) resonances

presented in Fig. 2, the (21,1)–(20,3) pair gives very small and almost constant contribution.

Let us ﬁnd out now an analytical expression for modelling the experimental data. We

start by analyzing the contribution to the conversion rate produced by the level pair (11,1)–
(9,3) which will be denoted as γa(E). This contribution can be obtained using the results of
Refs. [4,7]:

Here VM ′M ≡< µ′|V |µ > are the matrix elements of the perturbation ˆV in which only
M-indexes were shown explicitly; (:::) stands for the 3j-symbol; T is the magnitude of the
spin-spin interaction. Note, that the selection rules for the ortho-para state mixing by the
spin-spin interaction result from Eq. (5): |∆K|;|∆J|;|∆M| ≤ 2. In the ﬁtting procedure T
will be considered as an adjustable parameter. In Eq. (5) we have assumed all ΓM ′M being
equal: ΓM ′M ≡ Γ. This property of Γ is the consequence of the spherical symmetry of the
media. The decoherence decay rate Γ is an another unknown parameter which needs to be

determined.

The spacing between the M′ and M states in an electric ﬁled follows directly from the

Eq. (4)

ωM ′M (E) = ω0 +  K′|M′|

J′(J′ + 1) −

J(J + 1)!|dE|,
K|M|

(6)

where ω0 is the gap between the states (J′,K′) and (J,K) at zero electric ﬁeld. We have

considered in Eq. (6) only pairs of states which have ξ′ = ξ. They are the only pairs which

contribute to the spectrum in the electric ﬁeld range of Fig. 2. The level spacing ω0 will

be considered as an adjustable parameter in the ﬁtting. The dipole moment of 13CH3F
in the ground state, which is necessary for the calculation of ωM ′M (E), was determined
very accurately from the laser Stark spectroscopy of 13CH3F and was found equal d =
1.8579 ± 0.0006 D [16].

At zero electric ﬁeld the level pair (21,1)–(20,3) contributes nearly 30% to the total
conversion rate [10]. At electric ﬁelds, where γa(E) has peaks, this contribution is on the
order of 10−2 in comparison with γa(E). The ﬁrst crossing of the pair (21,1)-(20,3) occurs at
≃ 4000 V/cm thus having its peaks far away from the electric ﬁeld range of Fig. 2. In the
electric ﬁeld range of Fig. 2 (1–1200 V/cm) the contribution from the pair (21,1)-(20,3) is

changing by 10% only. Consequently, in the ﬁtting procedure the (21,1)-(20,3) contribution

is assumed to be constant. This quantity will be denoted as γb.

6

To summarize, the function which will be used to model the experimental data is

γ(E) = γa(E) + γb.

(7)

This function contains adjustable parameters T , Γ, ω0, and γb.

The result of the least-square ﬁt is shown in Fig. 2 by solid line. The error of the

individual experimental points in Fig. 2 was estimated as 7%. The values of the parameters

are given in the Table 1, where one standard deviation of statistical error is indicated.

Electric ﬁeld in the Stark cell was determined in experiment [8] by measuring the voltage

applied to the electrodes and assuming the distance between them equal to 4.18 mm, which

is the spacer thickness. It was found out after the experiment [8] was performed that the

thickness of the glue used to attach the Stark electrodes was not negligible. The updated
spacing between the electrodes in the Stark cell is l = 4.22 ± 0.02 mm. Such correction of
the spacing gives 1% systematic decrease of the experimental electric ﬁeld values given in

[8]. This shift is taken into account in Fig. 2.

V. THEORETICAL ESTIMATION OF THE PARAMETERS

Let us compare the parameters obtained in the previous section with their theoretical

estimates. We start from the analysis of the level spacing ω0. The best sets of the ground

state molecular parameters of 13CH3F are given in Ref. [17]. The spacing between the levels

(11,1) and (9,3) is presented in the Table 1 where the set having most accurate molecular

parameter A0 was used. The theoretical value appears to be close to the experimental one

obtained from the spin conversion spectra. The diﬀerence between them is

ω0(exp) − ω0(theor) = 1.0 ± 0.3 MHz,

(8)

which is less than 1% in comparison with ω0 itself.

Next, we calculate the parameter T which characterizes the spin-spin mixing of the level
pair (11,1)–(9,3) in 13CH3F. The spin-spin interaction between the two magnetic dipoles m1

and m2 separated by the distance r has the form [9]:

¯h ˆV12 = P12ˆI(1)ˆI(2) •
•
T (12)
ij = δij − 3ninj ;

T(12) ,

P12 = m1m2/r3I (1)I (2) ,

(9)

7

where ˆI(1) and ˆI(2) are the spin operators of the particles 1 and 2, respectively; n is the unit

vector directed along r; i and j are the Cartesian indexes.

For the spin-spin mixing of the ortho and para states in 13CH3F one has to take into ac-
count the interaction between the three hydrogen nuclei ( ˆVHH), between the three hydrogen
and ﬂuorine nuclei ( ˆVHF ), and between the three hydrogen and carbon nuclei ( ˆHHC). Thus

the total spin-spin interaction responsible for the mixing in 13CH3F is

ˆVSS = ˆVHH + ˆVHF + ˆVHC.

(10)

The complete expressions for all components of ˆVSS can be written by using Eq. (9) for the
spin-spin interaction between two particles. For example, for ˆVHF one has

ˆVHF = PHF Xn

ˆI(n)ˆIF •
•

TnF ; n = 1, 2, 3 .

(11)

Here PHF is the scaling factor analogous to P12 in Eq. (9); n refers to the hydrogen nuclei

in the molecule.

T can be calculated in a way similar to that used previously [4]. It gives

|T |2 = 3|PHHT (12)

2,2 |2 + 2|PHFT 1F

2,2 |2 + 2|PHCT 1C

2,2 |2.

(12)

2,2 is the spherical component of the second rank tensor T1q calculated in the molecular

Here T 1q
system of coordinates. The superscripts 1q indicate the interacting particles: 1 refers to the

hydrogen nucleus H(1) and q refers to the nucleus of H(2), or F, or C.

The calculation of T needs the knowledge of the molecular structure. We used the ground
state structure of 13CH3F determined in [18,19]: rCF = 1.390(1) ˚A, rCH = 1.098(1) ˚A, and
β(F − C − H) = 108.7o(2). The numbers in parentheses represent the error bars in units of
the last digit. By using these parameters one can obtain the value of T which is given in
the Table 1. The diﬀerence between the experimental and theoretical values of T is equal
to

Texp − Ttheor = −5.1 ± 0.5 kHz.

(13)

VI. DISCUSSION

Small diﬀerence between the experimental and theoretical values of ω0 unambigiously

conﬁrms that the mixed ortho-para level pair (9,3)–(11,1) was determined correctly. From

the spectroscopical data [17] one can conclude that there are no other ortho-para level pairs

which can mimic the level spacing ω0 = 130.99 MHz. It is also true if one takes into account

even all ortho-para level pairs ignoring the restrictions imposed by the selection rules for the

ortho-para state mixing.

The diﬀerence between experimental and theoretical values of the level spacing at zero
electric ﬁeld, ω0, is only 1.0 ± 0.3 MHz. The main error in theoretical value of ω0 is caused
by the error in the molecular parameter A0. It gives nearly half of the error indicated in

the Table 1. On the other hand, the J and K dependences of the molecular electric dipole

moment are too small [16] to aﬀect our determination of the theoretical value of ω0. It is

possible that the experimental value of ω0 is aﬀected by the pressure shift, which magnitude

we presently do not know. Further investigations can precise the frequency gap between the

states (9,3) and (11,1).

The diﬀerence between the experimental and theoretical values of T is rather small
(≃7%) but well outside the statistical error. This diﬀerence may originate from our method
of calculating T⊔h⌉≀∇ in which we used the molecular structure (bond lengths and angles)
averaged over ground state molecular vibration. More correct procedure would be to av-
erage an exact expression for T over molecular vibration. This requires rather extensive
calculations.

There are a few contributions to the systematic error of value of T⌉§√. The response
time of the setup used to measure the concentration of ortho molecules (≃ 1 sec) was not
taken into account in the processing of the experimental data. This gives ≃2% systematic
decrease in the value of T⌉§√. Another few percent of the systematic error may appear due
to the procedure employed in [8] to ﬁnd out the conversion rate inside the Stark cell. This

procedure relies on the ratio of the Stark cell volume to the volume outside the electric
ﬁeld. Taking these circumstances into account we can estimate that up to ≃10% diﬀerence
between the experimental and theoretical values of T can be explained by the systematic
errors. Despite this diﬀerence, it is rather safe to conclude that our analysis has proven

9

that the levels (9,3) and (11,1) are indeed mixed by the spin-spin interaction between the

molecular nuclei.

It is impressive that the level-crossing spectrum in the 13CH3F isomer

conversion has allowed to measure the hyperﬁne spin-spin coupling with the statistical error

of 0.5 kHz only.

Comparison between the measured spectrum and the model supports our choice for the

ΓM ′M being independent on M and M′. Independence of this parameter on M is the direct
consequence of the spatial isotropy of the media. The independence on M′ − M is more
intricate. This will be discussed in more detail elsewhere.

The value of Γ obtained from the ﬁtting procedure, Γ = (1.9±0.1)·108 s−1/Torr, appeared
to be close to the level population decay rate 1.0 · 108 s−1/Torr measured in Ref. [20] for
the state (J=5, K=3) of 13CH3F. The factor 2 diﬀerence is not surprising. Γ refers to the

decay rate of the oﬀ-diagonal density matrix element ρµ′µ between the states (11,1) and

(9,3) which should be diﬀerent from the population decay rate. In addition, the rotational

quantum numbers in these two cases are diﬀerent too.

Column designated as γ(0) in the Table 1 gives the rates at zero electric ﬁled. The

“theoretical value” is the magnitude of γ(0) given by the solid line in Fig. 2. The theoretical

value coincides well with the experimental one from Ref. [21]. Finally we would like to

mention that our analysis of the spin conversion spectrum has allowed to disentangle for the

ﬁrst time the contributions to the conversion rate which arise from the mixing of the two

level pairs: (9,3)–(11,1) and (20,3)–(21,1).

VII. CONCLUSIONS

We have performed the ﬁrst quantitative comparison of the level-crossing spectrum of the

nuclear spin conversion in 13CH3F with the theoretical model. This approach has allowed

to single out the contribution to the spin conversion caused by the mixing of one particular

pair of the ortho-para rotational states of the molecule and conﬁrmed unambiguously that

the mechanism of the intramolecular state mixing is the spin-spin interaction between the

molecular nuclei.

All important parameters of the theoretical model which describe the nuclear spin con-

version in 13CH3F due to the spin-spin mixing of the ortho-para level pair (9,3)–(11,1) are

10

determined quantitatively. These parameters are the decoherence rate, Γ, the spin-spin
mixing strength, T , the level spacing, ω0, and the contributions to the conversion rate from
the two level pairs separately (9,3)-(11,1) and (20,3)-(21,1). While the decoherence rate Γ

is diﬃcult to estimate on the basis of independent information, the experimental values for
the spin-spin mixing, T , and the level spacing, ω0, are found to be close to their theoretical
values. These results prove that the nuclear spin conversion in the 13CH3F molecules is

indeed governed by the quantum relaxation.

VIII. APPENDIX

The CH3F quantum states in the ground electronic and vibration state can be classiﬁed as

follows [22–24]. CH3F is a rigid symmetric top but it is more transparant to take molecular

inversion into account and classify the states in D3h symmetry group. First, one has to

introduce an additional (molecular) system of coordinates which has the orientation deﬁned

by the numbered hydrogen nuclei and z–axis directed along the molecular symmetry axis.

Next, one introduces the states

|β > ≡ |J, K, M > |I, σ, K >; K ≥ 0,

(14)

which are invariant under cyclic permutation of the three hydrogen nuclei: P123|β >= |β >.
In Eq. (14), |J, K, M > are the familiar rotational states of symmetric top, which are
characterized by the angular momentum (J), its projection (K) on the z-axis of the molecular

system of coordinates and the projection (M) on the laboratory quantization axis Z. I and σ

are the total spin of the three hydrogen nuclei and its projection on the Z-axis, respectively.
The explicit expression for the spin states |I, σ, K > is given in [22].

11

Permutation of any two hydrogen nuclei in CH3F inverts z-axis of the molecular system of

coordinates. Consequently, the action of such operation (P23, for instance) on the molecular
states reads: P23|β >= |β >, where β ≡ {J,−K, M, I, σ}. Note that the complete set of the
molecular states comprises both β and β sets.

Using the states |β > and |β > one can construct the states which have the proper

symmetry with respect to the permutation of any two hydrogen nuclei:

|β, κ > =

1
√2

[1 + (−1)κP23]|β >; κ = 0, 1.

(15)

The action of the permutation of two hydrogen nuclei on the state |β, κ > is deﬁned by the
rule: P23|β, κ >= (−1)κ|β, κ > and by similar relations for the permutations of the other
two pairs of hydrogen nuclei.

In the next step, one has to take into account the symmetric (|s = 1 >) and antisymmet-
ric (|s = 0 >) inversion states. The action of the permutation of the two hydrogen nuclei
on these states, for example P23, reads

P23|s = 0 > = −|s = 0 >; P23|s = 1 > = |s = 1 > .

(16)

Evidently, the cyclic permutation of the three hydrogen nuclei of the molecule does not

change the inversion states.

The total spin-rotation states of CH3F should be antisymmetric under permutation of

any two hydrogen nuclei, because protons are fermions. Consequently, the only allowed
states of CH3F are |β, κ = s > |s >.

Finally, the description of the CH3F states should be completed by adding the spin states

of ﬂuorine and carbon (13C) nuclei, both having spin equal 1/2:

|α > = |β, κ = s > |s > |σF > |σC >,

(17)

where σF and σC are the Z-projections of the F and 13C nuclei’ spins, respectively.

In

the following, we will denote the states (17) of a free molecule as α-basis. For the rigid
symmetric tops, as CH3F is, the states |α > are degenerate over the quantum numbers s,
M, σ, σF , σC.

FIG. 1. Ortho and para states of 13CH3F in the ground vibrational state. The level energies

were calculated using the molecular parameters from [17]. The (11,1)–(9,3) pair of states is shown

to be mixed by the intramolecular perturbation. The bent lines indicate the rotational relaxation

induced by gas collisions. These collisions do not provide direct ortho-para transitions.

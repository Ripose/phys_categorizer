and Photodissociation of Vinyl Chloride

We demonstrate theoretically and experimentally that the Gouy phase of a focused laser beam
may be used to control the photo-induced reactions of a polyatomic molecule. Quantum mechanical
interference between one- and three-photon excitation of vinyl chloride produces a small phase lag
between the dissociation and ionization channels on the axis of the molecular beam. Away from
the axis, the Gouy phase introduces a much larger phase lag that agrees quantitatively with theory
without any adjustable parameters.

It is an axiom of quantum mechanics that the proba-
bility of an event may be calculated by adding the prob-
ability amplitudes of all independent paths connecting
the initial and ﬁnal states and then taking the modulus
squared of that sum [1]. Because the phases of diﬀer-
ent paths vary with the parameters of the system, the
transition probability displays an oscillatory pattern with
respect to those parameters. Brumer and Shapiro [2] pre-
dicted that, by manipulating the appropriate parameters,
an experimenter could control the outcome of the event.
Their theory has been validated experimentally for nu-
merous systems [3-8].

The most commonly studied control scenario is the
multiphoton excitation of a target by diﬀerent numbers
of photons in each path. Brumer and Shapiro showed
that for the absorption of n photons of frequency ωm
and m photons of frequency ωn, such that nωm = mωn,
the probability of obtaining product S is given by

P S = P S

m + P S

n + 2P S

mn cos(φsp + δS

mn),

(1)

m is the n−photon transition probability, P S

where P S
n is
the m−photon probability, and P S
mn is the amplitude of
the interference term [9]. The interference term is given
explicitly by the integral

mnei(φsp+δS
P S

mn) =

Z

dˆkhg|D(m)|E, S, ˆkihE, S, ˆk|D(n)|gi,

(2)
where |gi is the ground state, |E, S, ˆki is the excited con-
tinuum state, E and ˆk are the energy and momentum
of the excited state, and D(j) is the j-photon transition
dipole operator. The phase of this term consists of a spa-
tial component, φsp, which is a property of the radiation
ﬁeld (contained in D(j)), and a molecular component,
δS
mn, which depends on the electronic structure of the
target [10], [11]. The molecular phase (also known as the
channel phase) may arise, for example, from coupling of
electronic continua, from a resonant state embedded in
the continuum (both contained in |E, S, ˆki) [12], or from
an intermediate resonant state (contained in D(j)) [13].
Because δS
mn is channel-dependent, it is possible to con-
trol the product distribution by manipulating φsp.

The spatial phase itself has three components,

φsp = (mφn − nφm) + (mknz − nkmz)

+ (m − n)η(z),

(3)

where φi is a constant phase of the electric ﬁeld, z is
the axial coordinate of the ﬁeld, ki is the wave number,
η(z) = tan−1(z/zR) is the Gouy phase, and zR is the
Rayleigh range [14]. The ﬁrst term in φsp is proportional
to the diﬀerence between the refractive indices at fre-
quencies ωm and ωn [15]. The second term is usually as-
sumed to vanish because of momentum conservation (al-
though see ref. [16] for a possible counter-example). The
Gouy phase shift in the third term results from the in-
creased phase velocity of a Gaussian beam, as compared
with a plane wave, as it propagates through a focal region
[17], [18], [19]. More generally, it has been shown that
the Gouy phase results from a spread in the transverse
momentum of the focused beam [20]. This phase does
not appear in Brumer and Shapiro’s formulation, pre-
sumably because it is not explicitly channel-dependent.
Chen and Elliott [21] demonstrated that the modulation
of the signal produced by one- and three-photon ioniza-
tion of mercury atoms undergoes a π phase shift as the
probed region passes through the focal point of the laser
beams.
In all previous phase control experiments, the
refractive term (mφn − nφm) was adjusted experimen-
tally to cancel the molecular phase for a selected chan-
nel, thereby enhancing the yield from that channel. Here
we demonstrate that the Gouy phase may be exploited
to control a branching ratio, even in the absence of a
molecular phase.

The system we chose to study is the photodissociation
and photoionization of vinyl chloride (CH2 = CHCl,
V Cl). A potential energy diagram for these reactions
is shown in Fig. 1 [22].
In our study, three 532 nm
photons (at frequency ω1) and one 177 nm photon (at
frequency ω3) are used to excite the molecule to a quasi-
bound 1π, π∗ state. At this energy level, the molecule
can either predissociate to yield Cl + C2H3 fragments
(among others [23]), or it may absorb two additional 532
nm photons and ionize to produce V Cl+.

The experimental method is similar to that used pre-

with the axis of the molecular beam located at a distance
zm from the focal line. Representative modulation curves
are shown in Fig. 3, recorded on the axis of the molec-
ular beam (panel (b)) and at the two extreme positions
(panels (a) and (c)). Repeated (3 to 6) measurements of
these curves obtained on diﬀerent days yielded average
phase lags of 46.3 ± 1.70 at zm = −441.6µm, 4.4 ± 0.80 at
zm = 0, and −43.6 ± 3.30 at zm = +441.6µm, where the
uncertainty is a single standard deviation for all the mea-
surements at each point. The least squares uncertainty
of the ﬁtted value of the phase lag for a single scan is
typically twice the standard deviation of the mean for
multiple measurements at the same point. The phase
lags at all nine axial positions are plotted in Fig. 4.

A qualitative explanation of the spatial dependence of
the phase lag is as follows. Although the Gouy phase
shifts for the two channels are identical at every point
in space, the spatial distributions of the product concen-
trations diﬀer because of their diﬀerent intensity depen-
dences. A spatial average of the interference term over
the entire irradiated volume yields a net phase lag be-
tween the products. A quantitative value of the spatial
phase may be obtained by averaging the interference term
over the axial and radial coordinates of the laser beam.

R
describes the divergence of the beam [14]. We further
assume that m visible and n UV photons are absorbed
in the control step to produce the neutral fragments, and
that l additional visible photons are absorbed to produce
the parent ion. We also assume that the molecular beam
has a rectangular proﬁle of width 2d. The spatial average
of the transition probability is then obtained by inserting

viously [24]. Key elements of the setup are depicted in
Fig. 2. A pulsed nozzle beam of neat V Cl intersects
the laser beams, which are focused by a pair of mirrors,
M1 and M2. The molecular beam has a Gaussian pro-
ﬁle with a FWHM of 397 µm. The oﬀ-axis conﬁguration
of the mirrors produces two astigmatic, elliptical foci,
one perpendicular to the plane deﬁned by the laser and
molecular beam and the other in the plane. All the data
reported here used the in-plane (horizontal) focus. Mir-
ror M2 is mounted on a motorized stage, allowing the
focal point to be translated across the molecular beam
with sub-micron resolution. The frequency of the sec-
ond harmonic of a Nd:YAG laser (532 nm) is tripled in
a mercury oven to produce 177 nm radiation, and the
relative phase of the ﬁelds (φ3 − 3φ1) is varied by passing
the beams through a chamber ﬁlled with hydrogen gas
(not shown). The reaction products are detected with a
time-of-ﬂight mass spectrometer. Additional details will
be provided in a future publication.

Repeated scans of the molecular beam proﬁle were
recorded to determine its peak location, which deﬁnes the
origin of the z-axis. Next, the ion yield vs. H2 pressure
(referred to as the ”modulation curve”) was measured
for V Cl+ and C2H +
3 for nine positions of the laser focus,

The analytical value of φsp is given by the dashed curve
in Fig. 4 for d = 400µm and zR = 64µm. Even bet-
ter agreement with the data is obtained by taking into
account the astigmatism of the laser beam and the Gaus-
sian proﬁle of the molecular beam. A numerical evalu-
ation of φsp is given by the solid curve in Fig. 4, with
no adjustable parameters. The small negative phase lag
calculated for zm = 0 is a residual eﬀect of the second
laser focus. Details of the calculation will be presented

FIG. 4: Phase lag as a function of the distance of the molecu-
lar beam axis from the focal line of the laser. A positive phase
lag corresponds to the parent ion signal leading the fragment.
Error bars for the data points at zm = 0 and ±441.6µm are
the standard deviations of repeated measurements, whereas
the error bars for the other points are derived from the least
squares ﬁts to a single pair of modulation curves. The dashed
line is the analytical result (Eq. (7)) for a circular Gaussian
focus and a rectangular molecular beam proﬁle. The solid
curve is a numerical calculation of the spatial phase, taking
into account the astigmatic focus of the laser beam and the
Gaussian proﬁle of the molecular beam.

The data in Fig. 3 and the quantitative agreement
between experiment and theory in Fig. 4 provide a num-
ber of valuable insights. First, our data demonstrate
that coherent phase modulation of large molecules is ro-
bust. Bersohn et al. [6] previously demonstrated control
of bound-to-bound transitions in polyatomic molecules,
[7], it is shown that phase
but here, and also in ref.
control of reactive transitions in molecules having large
densities of states is achievable with modulation depths
as large as 42%. Second, the excellent agreement be-
tween experiment and theory is obtained only for m = 3,
n = 1, and l = 2. This ﬁnding provides direct evidence
that the C2H +
3 signal is produced by photodissociation
of the neutral molecule at the three-photon level and not

by fragmentation of the parent ion. In other words, we
are controlling the branching between ladder climbing
and ladder switching. (If C2H +
3 was produced by frag-
mentation of the parent ion, the Gouy phase lag would
vanish.) Of course, the branching ratio could also be
controlled by varying the total energy of the of the laser
pulse, but here we have shown that for a ﬁxed set of
laser conditions it is possible to control the branching ra-
tio coherently by varying only the relative phase of the
two laser beams. Third, the positive experimental phase
lag at zm = 0 diﬀers signiﬁcantly (at the 99.9% level)
from the theoretical value of −1.30. We believe that this
phase lag is due to a molecular phase in one or both of
channels at the 3ω1 level. The small value of the phase
lag is comparable in size to that found by Tachiya et al.
for a diﬀrerent molecule [7], but it is unclear at this point
whether larger channel phases might exist closer to the
center of the π, π∗ transition.

It should be noted that the ionic wave function (at the
5ω1 level) does not contribute to the observed phase lag
because the two visible photons that connect the inter-
mediate π, π∗ state to the ionic state are present in the
two interfering paths (ω3 + 2ω1 and 5ω1), so that any
molecular phase that is picked up in one path is exactly
cancelled by one in the other path.

In conclusion, we have shown that the Gouy phase of
a focused laser beam may be used to control the branch-
ing ratio of a photo-induced reaction. This phase, which
was not included in previous formulations of coherent
phase control, adds linearly to the refractive and molec-
ular phases in the interference term. A necessary and
suﬃcient condition for the Gouy phase to serve as a con-
trol parameter is that the product yields have diﬀerent
intensity dependences.

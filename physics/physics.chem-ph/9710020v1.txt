ABSTRACT

The multicanonical ansatz is used to study variations in the energy landscape of a small
peptide, Met-enkephalin, under a change from the ECEPP/2 force ﬁeld to ECEPP/3. Lo-
cal minima with energies up to 5 kcal/mol higher than the global minima are sampled
and classiﬁed according to H-bridges and backbone angles. The distribution and relative
weight for various temperatures of the minima are calculated and compared for the two
force ﬁelds. We demonstrate that while there are small diﬀerences in the energy land-
scape our results at relevant temperatures are robust under changes between ECEPP/2
to ECEPP/3.

Introduction

While there is considerable progress in numerical simulation of peptides and proteins (for

a recent review see, for instance, [1]), prediction of their low temperature conformations

solely from ﬁrst principles remains a formidable task. First, the interactions between

the atoms in the molecules are described by force ﬁelds which depend in part on empir-

ically determined parameters. It is still an open question which of the many force ﬁelds

(AMBER [2], CHARMM [3], ECEPP [4] - [7], ...) is the optimal choice (or if they are

suﬃciently accurate at all). The other mayor problem is common to many important

physical systems. At low temperatures the energy landscape of proteins is characterized

by a multitude of local minima separated by high energy barriers. In simulations based on

classical molecular dynamics or Monte Carlo techniques [8] these barriers can be seldom

crossed. Hence, only small parts of phase space are sampled (in a ﬁnite number of Monte

Carlo sweeps) and physical quantities cannot be calculated accurately. For this reason,

the “native” conformation of a protein (which should correspond to the global minimum

in free energy) is often identiﬁed with the lowest potential energy conﬁguration. In this

approximation entropic contributions are ignored, but it allows application of optimiza-

tion techniques like simulated annealing [10], genetic algorithms [9] or Monte Carlo with

Minimization [11] to tackle the protein folding problem. However, this approximation

may be to crude. Especially for smaller peptides entropic contributions are expected to

be important.

It is not always clear whether the limited quality of numerical results is due to insuﬃ-

cient simulation algorithms or inadequate force ﬁelds. Recent progress in the development

of Monte Carlo techniques may change this situation. Simulations in generalized ensem-

bles promise a much better sampling of the phase space. A numerical comparison of some

of these new algorithms can be found in Ref. [12]. One of its more prominent expo-

nents is the so called multicanonical approach of Berg and co-workers [13] who propose

a weighting scheme which yield to a ﬂat probability distribution in energy. Hence, all

energies have equal weight and an one-dimensional random walk in energy space is car-

ried out (when simulated with local updates) which ensures that the simulation will not

2

get trapped in any local energy minimum. The Boltzmann distributions may be obtained

for a given range of temperatures from one multicanonical simulation by re-weighting the

states [14]. The method was exploited to model ﬁrst-order phase transitions [13, 15] and

spin-glass systems [16, 17, 18]. The prediction of peptide and protein three-dimensional

structures with multicanonical algorithms was ﬁrst addressed in Ref. [19] for Monte Carlo

methods and in Ref. [20] for molecular dynamics. Subsequent works include the study

of coil–globular transitions of a model protein [21], helix-coil transitions of amino acid

homo–oligomers [22] and the conformational sampling of a constrained peptide [23].

In the current article we use the multicanonical technique to compare distribution and

relative weight of the local minima at room temperature and below for the closely related

ECEPP/2 and ECEPP/3 force ﬁeld in the case of the small pentapeptide Met-enkephalin.

ECEPP/3 deviates from the previous ECEPP/2 by slightly diﬀerent parameters due to

improvements in the experimental measurements. We want to study the inﬂuence of

such small changes on the energy landscape and our observed quantities. This should

show us how much numerical simulations are aﬀected by experimental uncertainties in

the parameters of the force ﬁelds.

Methods

Multicanonical Algorithm

Although the multicanonical approach is explained in detail elsewhere (see, for instance

Refs. [16, 24]), we brieﬂy summarize the idea and implementation of the method for

completeness.

Simulations in the canonical ensemble weight each conﬁguration with wB(E, β) = e−βE

and yield the usual Boltzmann probability density distribution of energies:

PB(E, T ) ∝ n(E)e−βE

(1)

where

n(E) is the density of states with energy E, and

β = 1

kB T ; with temperature

T and Boltzmann constant kB.

On the other hand, in the multicanonical approach conﬁgurations with energy E are

3

updated with a weight:

wmu(E) ∝ n−1(E) = e−S(E)

where S(E) is the microcanonical entropy. A uniform distribution of the energy

Pmu(E) = n(E)w(E) = const

is obtained from the simulation with these weight factors.

In this way information is

collected over the whole energy range and from a single simulation one can obtain the

canonical distribution for a wide range of temperatures by the re-weighting techniques:[14]

PB(T, E) ∝ Pmu(E)w−1

mue−βE .

This allows one to calculate any thermodynamic quantity O by

< O >T = Z

dE O(E)PB(T, E)

.

dE PB(T, E)

Z

However, unlike in a canonical simulation the weights wmu(E) are not a priori known

(in fact, knowledge of the exact weights is equivalent with solving the system), and one

needs its estimators for a numerical simulation. One way to obtain these estimators is

the following iterative procedure. Starting with an initial guess w0

mu(E) = e−β0E, i.e.,

performing a canonical simulation at suﬃcient high temperature T0, improved estima-

tors of the multicanonical weights are calculated from histograms P i−1

mu (E) of preceding

simulations by

wi

mu(E) =

wi−1
mu (E)
P i−1(E)

.

For details, see Ref. [22] and [24]. This method for calculating multicanonical weights is

by no means unique and while it is quite general, it has the disadvantage that it requires

a certain number of extra iterations which is not a priori known.

Force-Fields

In ECEPP [4]–[7] the potential energy function Etot is given by the sum of the electrostatic

term EC, 12-6 Lennard-Jones term ELJ , and hydrogen-bond term EHB for all pairs of

Here, rij is the distance between the atoms i and j, and χl is the torsion angle for the

chemical bond l. In ECEPP bond lengths and bond angles (which are hard degrees of free-

dom) are ﬁxed at experimental values and no out-of-plane deformation of peptide bonds

is allowed leaving the dihedral angles φ, ψ, ω and χ as independent variables. The various

parameters (qi, Aij, Bij, Cij, Dij, Ul, and nl) for the energy function were determined by

a combination of a priori calculations and minimization of the potential energies of the

crystal lattices of single amino acids. In the light of more recent experimental ﬁndings the

standard geometry and some energy parameters for prolyl and hydroxyprolyl have been

updated. Together with a re-calculation of partial atomic charges of mainchain atoms

this led to a revision of the ECEPP/2 parameter set to ECEPP/3. In the original formu-

lation of the ECEPP/2 parameter set, the net charges of both the N- and the C-terminal

residues, added up to the desired net charge of the molecule. Now each terminal amino

acid residue carries a total charge of 0/+1/-1 at the N- or C-terminus, respectively. The

correction avoids possible artifacts for systems with terminal groups of diﬀerent types

(e.g. one terminus charged, the other uncharged).

Simulation and Technical Details

To investigate changes in the energy landscape under small variations of the force ﬁeld

we have studied one of the simplest peptides, Met-enkephalin which has the amino acid

sequence Tyr-Gly-Gly-Phe-Met. This peptide is convenient for our purpose, since for the

potential energy function ECEPP/2 the lowest energy conformation is known [11, 25, 26]

5

and local minima with energies not much higher than the global minimum were sampled

and classiﬁed for this molecule by Braun and co-workers.[27] We compare our results

with theirs and calculate in addition the relative weight of the local minima at various

temperatures which is not possible with the method used by Braun et al.

For our simulations the backbone was terminated by a neutral –NH2 group at the

N-terminus and a neutral –COOH group at the C-terminus as in the previous works of

Met-enkephalin. For Met-enkephalin the two versions of ECEPP diﬀer in the point charges

for terminal groups which are listed in Tab. 1. The peptide-bond dihedral angles ω were

ﬁxed at the value 180◦, leaving 19 dihedral angles as independent variables.2 Interactions

of the molecule with solvent molecules were neglected and the dielectric constant ǫ was

set equal to 2. We used the program SMC [28] which was modiﬁed to accommodate the

multicanonical ensemble.

The multicanonical weight factors were determined separately for both ECEPP/2 and

ECEPP/3 by the iterative procedure described above. We needed 100,000 sweeps for

their calculation. One MC sweep updates every dihedral angle of the molecule once.

For each update of an angle a new randomly chosen value out of the interval [−π, π]

was proposed and the new conﬁguration then accepted or rejected by the Metropolis

criteria. All thermodynamic quantities were calculated for ECEPP/2 and ECEPP/3

separately from a production run of 200,000 MC sweeps following additional 10,000 sweeps

for equilibration each. The energy after each sweep was stored for further analysis. In

all cases, each simulation started from a completely random initial conformation (“Hot

Start”), but in the case of ECEPP/2 we also checked our results for shorter runs against

these with initial conﬁguration of the known groundstate (“Cold Start”), and we found

that the results are in agreement with those from random initial conformations. This

suggests that thermal equilibrium has been attained in our simulations. This conjecture

is further supported by Fig. 1, in which we show the timeseries of the energy for both
2We ﬁxed these hard degrees of freedom to reduce the number of variables. It would be more rigorous
to allow for bending of the peptide angles. Similarly, one could argue that the ﬁxed geometry of ECEPP
should be replaced by a ﬂexible one (as in other force ﬁelds), for instance by including Fixman potentials.
However, in this article we are mostly interested in comparing two variants of a force ﬁeld, not in
reproducing experimentally found structures by numerical simulation, which allow us to choose a less
rigorous approach.

production runs. In the course of the simulation, a 1d random walk in the energy between

low energy states and high energy states is performed as one would expect for local updates

from the deﬁnition of the multicanonical ensemble. It is evident that low energy states

which are separated in the timeseries by high energy states (which correspond to high

temperature states) are uncorrelated. The number of such “tunnel” events is therefore a

lower limit for the number of independent low energy states visited in the simulation.

In order to investigate the energy landscape of our peptide we not only stored the

energy of the actual conformation after each MC sweep, but also minimized a copy of

this conformation if its energy was less than a certain limit, 0 kcal/mol. While this limit

is somehow arbitrary, our experience shows that it allows a rough distinction between a

“low temperature region” and a “high temperature region” (it is the expectation value of

Energy at T = 300K where the speciﬁc heat has its maximum). From the minimization

process we receive a local minimum conformation. Conﬁgurations which yield the same

local minima belong to the same valley in the energy landscape and are therefore related

to each other. Since we are mainly interested in local minima not too far away from the

global minimum and to save disc space, we introduced a second limit. Only if the energy

of the minimized conﬁguration was below −6 kcal/mol (≈ 5 kcal/mol above the global

minimum) it was stored for further analysis. In Tab. 2 we summarize the absolute number

of local minima sampled in this way for both variants of the ECEPP force ﬁeld.

While the set of conﬁgurations we received from our production runs are all local

minima, due to limitations of the minimizer (a Newton-Raphson variant) they are not

necessarily the lowest conﬁgurations associated with a certain valley in the energy land-

scape. Each valley is in itself rough and consists of subvalleys separated by energy barriers.

Since we are not interested in the microscopic details of the energy landscape we further

clustered our local minima and identiﬁed each cluster by its member with the lowest en-

ergy. In this way, only a small number (less than 5) of groups remains at the end of our

clustering by which the overwhelming number of local minima is classiﬁed.

We describe now brieﬂy our clustering technique. In a ﬁrst step we sorted all minimized

conformers according to their energy. In a second step, we looked for identical conformers.

Two conformers were regarded as identical if they diﬀer in no angle more than 1◦ (taking

7

symmetries in account) and in their energies less than 0.0001 kcal/mol. For further

clustering, we kept only the non-identical conformations. Their number which is also

shown in Tab. 2 is our estimate for the total number of local minima with energy below

−6 kcal/mol. It is interesting to observe that the number of non-identical conformers

sampled in the multicanonical runs is similar for each choice of force ﬁeld while the

absolute number of sampled local minima varies much more (see Tab. 2).

In a third

step, using all backbone angles, the conformer (from our remaining set of non-identical

local minima conformations) with the lowest energy is compared to all other with higher

energies, according to diﬀerences in their backbone dihedrals. The conformers having all

their angles within 10◦ in comparison with the ﬁrst one, with respect to symmetry, are

put into the same cluster, which is represented by the ﬁrst conformer. This procedure

is repeated for the next conformer with higher energy, which was not counted in the

ﬁrst cluster by comparing its angles with all the other remaining ”free” conformers. In

this way, we are left with 160 clusters for ECEPP/2 and 571 clusters for ECEPP/3. In

the ﬁnal step these clusters were classiﬁed into few groups using similarities in hydrogen

bonding and the signiﬁcant dihedrals, necessary to preserve the characteristic hydrogen

bonds. The ﬁnal groups which should represent the main valleys in the energy landscape

of our peptide are characterized by their lowest-energy conformer.

In Fig. 2a and 2b we display how in the course of our simulations diﬀerent valleys of

the energy landscape (characterized by its corresponding group number) are visited. We

show only that times when the simulation visit one of the 4 (3) most important clusters

for ECEPP/2 (ECEPP/3) and no plot symbol means that the simulation did not visit

one of these valleys. As one can see there are diﬀerent slices in which the multicanonical

simulation moved only inside of a valley separated by jumps between diﬀerent valleys.

Again the number of these slices will give a lower limit on the number of independent low

energy states visited in the simulation.

Results and Discussion

Using the techniques described above we were able for each choice of the force ﬁeld to

classify the large number of local minimum conformations sampled in our multicanonical

8

runs into few groups which represent more than 80% of the sampled local minimum

conformations and which correspond to the important valleys in the energy landscape of

Met-enkephalin.

In Fig. 3a and Fig. 3b the dominant groups for both variants of the

ECEPP force ﬁeld are shown. In addition, we present in Tab. 3 the dihedral angles for

the global minimum conformations obtained by our method. These structures are also

shown in Fig. 4a and Fig. 4b.

The global minimum for ECEPP/3 has characteristic hydrogen bond of the NH-group

of Phe(4) with the carbonyl group of Try(1) resulting in a β -bend between the ﬁrst

and fourth residue. To preserve this hydrogen bond only the backbone angles of Gly(2)

and Gly(3) have to be conserved and therefore one ﬁnds a large number of variants

diﬀering from the global minimum stucture in the other backbone and sidechain dihedrals

in this group (which we call group “1”). The second group (“2”) is characterized by the

local minimum conﬁguration with the second lowest energy in the ECEPP/3 force ﬁeld.

This conﬁguration has two possible hydrogen bonds between N-H and C=O groups of

the Gly(2) and Met(5) residue forming a II’-type β-turn between the second and last

residue. Since more backbone dihedrals have to be conserved to preserve the two hydrogen

bonds the conﬁgurations of this group vary much less than in the case of the previous

group. Despite their diﬀerences (see Figs. 3 and 4) the lowest energy exponent of both

groups diﬀers by only 0.04 kcal/mol in potential energy, so that one can regard the

global minimum of Met-enkephalin in the ECEPP/3 force ﬁeld as degenerated. However,

the electrostatic energy for the ECEPP/3-minimum is raised substantially if ECEPP/2

charges are used for this structure. The total potential energy increases from Etot =

−10.84 kcal/mol (ECEPP/3) to Etot = −9.46 kcal/mol (ECEPP2) while the energy

of the other conﬁguration changes only from Etot = −10.81 kcal/mol (ECEPP/3) to

Etot = −10.72 kcal/mol (ECEPP/2), which is the global minimum of Met-enkephalin in

the ECEPP/2 force ﬁeld [25, 26]. Conﬁgurations of both group “1” and “2” were also

found in our ECEPP/2 simulation.

We remark that our peptide seems to have a much richer spectrum of low energy

local minimum conﬁgurations in the ECEPP/3 force ﬁeld than in the case of ECEPP/2,

but show in Fig. 3b only one more (the other contribute with less than 1% each) group.

9

Conformers of this group (“H”) are characterized by a hydrogen bond between C=O

group of the Tyr(1) and the N-H group of Met(5) residues. Together with the backbone

dihedrals of Gly(2), Gly(3) and Phe(4) this hydrogen bonding resembles that of an α-

helix.

Its lowest energy exponent has a potential energy of −10.56 kcal/mol which is

only 0.25 kcal/mol higher than the groundstate. No such conformation was found in

the ECEPP/2 simulation. In the case of ECEPP/2, two more groups appeared with a

frequency of more than 1% and are shown in Fig. 3a. Both are II’ type β-turns. Group

“a” is characterized by single hydrogen bond between Gly(2) and Met(5). The lowest

energy conformation in this group has a potential energy of −9.74 kcal/mol which make

this group to the one with the second lowest potential energy, separated by ≈ 1 kcal/mol

from the groundstate. Group “b” has its hydrogen bond between Tyr(1) and Phe(4), its

lowest energy exponent has a potential energy of −9.52 kcal/mol). Both groups were also

found in the ECEPP/3 simulation, but with frequencies less than 1% of the non-identical

conformers.

For ECEPP/2 our local minimum conformations resemble those found in previous

work [27] where in diﬀerence to the present work the peptide angles were released. Fixing

these angles therefore seems to be a reasonable approximation. But while our classiﬁcation

of low energy local minima can also be obtained with other methods, the multicanonical

approach allows in addition the estimation of the relative weight of these conformers as

a function of temperature, i.e. entropic contributions can be considered. As an example

we show in Fig. 5a and 5b the relative weight of the dominant groups of conformation for

both ECEPP/2 and ECEPP/3. Note that around 300K the percentage of conﬁgurations

which are in none of our groups (and hence do not belong to the important valleys)

decreases dramatically for both force ﬁelds. At high temperatures coil structures dominate

which show large ﬂexibility and and therefore a broad energy spectrum. On the other

hand, at low temperatures ordered structures are expected which are each conﬁned to

one of the valleys in the energy landscape.

In the case of the ECEPP/2 simulation

the percentage of conﬁgurations of type ‘1’ (the ECEPP/3 groundstate) never exceeded

4%. Conﬁgurations of type ‘2’ (the groundstate for ECEPP/2) are found with much

higher probability, but at room temperature they contribute to only about 30 % of the

10

conformers which conﬁrms older work [19]. For ECEPP/3 we ﬁnd that the probability

of conﬁgurations of type ‘2’ is comparable to that of the ECEPP/2 simulation. At room

temperature they contribute again to around 30% of the conformers. Conformations of

type ‘1’ appear with much higher probability than in the ECEPP/2 simulation, but that of

type ‘2’ are still dominating in the range of shown temperatures. At relevant temperatures

the probability for ﬁnding the ECEPP/2 groundstate (type ‘2’) is twice as high as that

of ﬁnding the ECEPP/3 groundstate (type ‘1’). Of course we expect that at T = 0 K

we will ﬁnd only the ECEPP/3 groundstate (type ‘1’), however the energy diﬀerence

is much too small (about 0.04 kcal/mol) to favor them at ﬁnite temperatures against

type ‘2’ structures. This proofs that at least for small peptides entropic contributions

cannot be neglected. Any pure optimization method (in the potential energy) may lead

to conﬁgurations which are of only limited signiﬁcance at relevant temperatures.

In the ﬁnal plots we like to show how the variations in the force ﬁeld aﬀects two

important thermodynamic quantities. Fig. 6 displays the average energy < E > as a

function of temperature. Again, we observe only little diﬀerences between the ECEPP/2

and ECEPP/3 force ﬁelds for the physical relevant temperature range. Below 400 K these

diﬀerences are within the errorbars, while for higher temperatures the ECEPP/3 energies

are systematically lower by a small amount. Similar results were found for the speciﬁc

heat C(T ) as function of temperature shown in Fig. 7. Here we deﬁne

C( ˆβ) = ˆβ2 < E2 > − < E >2

.

(12)

Neither the position of its maximum nor its shape or heights vary much indicating that

the transition between ordered and disordered states is of the same kind for both variants

of the force ﬁeld. Note that the position of the peak in speciﬁc heat corresponds to

the increase of structures which belong to one of the main groups and the decrease of

conﬁgurations which do not belong to any of the signiﬁcant energy valleys.

Conclusion

We used the multicanonical approach to study variations of the energy landscape of Met-

enkephalin under a change from the ECEPP/2 force ﬁeld to ECEPP/3. In both cases, the

11

low-energy local minima were sampled and classiﬁed into a small number of groups which

correspond to essential valleys of the energy landscape. We studied their distribution and

relative weight at various temperatures. While the energy landscape diﬀers in detail and

specially the global minimum is not the same, our physical results are little aﬀected by

changes between the two force ﬁelds. Our analysis demonstrates that at least for small

peptides it is not suﬃcient to search only for the global minimum in potential energy since

this conformation may be of limited signiﬁcance at room temperature. Our work corrob-

orates the well known fact that small ﬂexible molecules exist at room temperature in an

ensemble of low energy conformations (see for instance Ref. [1] and work cited therein)

whose relative weight has to be determined. Finally, our results show that numerical sim-

ulations of peptides are stable under small changes in the utilized force ﬁelds. Especially

thermodynamic quantities are little changed. This is an important observation since all

force ﬁelds rely on experimentally determined parameters and are therefore known only

within certain errorbars.

FIGURE CAPTIONS:

FIG. 1: Timeseries of potential energy, obtained from a multicanonical simulation of

200,000 MC sweeps, using a) the ECEPP/2 and b) the ECEPP/3 force ﬁeld.

FIG. 2: Timeseries of clusters, obtained from a multicanonical simulation of 200,000 MC

sweeps, using a) the ECEPP/2 and b) the ECEPP/3 force ﬁeld.

FIG. 3: Most frequent low energy conformers for a) ECEPP/2 and b) ECEPP/3. Shown

are also their Zimmermann codes, the frequency with which they appear in the multi-

canonical simulation and the potential energy of their lowest energy exponent Emin.

FIG. 4: Groundstate conﬁgurations of a) ECEPP/2 and b) ECEPP/3. The plots were

drawn using RASMOL.

FIG. 5: Relative weight of the important groups of conﬁgurations in the case of a)

ECEPP/2 and b) ECEPP/3. We have sum up all local minima which do not belong

to one of the mayor groups in “Other”. Likewise “No Minimum” contains all conﬁgu-

rations which could not be minimized to a local minimum with potential energy below

−6 kcal/mol (see text).

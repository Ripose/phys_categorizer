Abstract. Convergence problems in coupled-cluster iterations are discussed, and
a new iteration scheme is proposed. Whereas the Jacobi method inverts only the
diagonal part of the large matrix of equation coeﬃcients, we invert a matrix which also
includes a relatively small number of oﬀ-diagonal coeﬃcients, selected according to the
excitation amplitudes undergoing the largest change in the coupled cluster iteration.
A test case shows that the new IPM (inversion of partial matrix) method gives much
better convergence than the straightforward Jacobi-type scheme or such well-known
convergence aids as the reduced linear equations or direct inversion in iterative subspace
methods.

2

The coupled cluster (CC) method is widely used in electronic structure calculations.
The CC theory has been described in many reviews (see, e.g., [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]), and will
not be presented here. The basic equation for the CC method is the Bloch equation

ΩHΩ = HΩ,

(1)

where H is the Hamiltonian and Ω is the wave operator. The resulting equations have
the general algebraic form

Ai +

N
X
j=1

B(t)ijtj = 0,

i = 1, 2, . . . , N ,

(2)

where tj are the cluster or excitation amplitudes to be determined, N is the number of
the unknown amplitudes, A is a vector and B(t) is a square matrix which in general
depends upon t. For simplicity, we consider the case when B does not depend upon t,

Ai +

N
X
j=1

Bijtj = 0,

i = 1, 2, . . . , N.

(3)

The generalization for the case of B(t) is straightforward (and implemented in the
relativistic CC code employed for the test examples below). The direct solution of
equations (3) using the Gauss elimination method is feasible only for systems with a few
thousand cluster amplitudes at most, whereas problems encountered in our relativistic
CC may involve millions of such amplitudes. A Jacobi-type iterative method is usually
applied to solve these equations. Using the fact that B is normally a diagonally dominant
matrix, the method involves direct inversion of the diagonal part D of B. The system (3)
is rewritten in the form

ti = −(D−1)ii[Ai +

N
X
j=1

(B − D)ijtj],

i = 1, 2, . . . , N

(4)

and is solved iteratively.

The coupled cluster calculations are often beset by convergence diﬃculties. This is
particularly true for multireference CC methods, such as the Fock-space approach [2, 3].
Several methods for improving convergence have been proposed; the most commonly
used are the reduced linear equations (RLE) [6] and direct inversion in the iterative
subspace (DIIS) [7, 8] approaches. These help in some, but not all, cases. Most severe
convergence problems may be traced to the existence of intruder states. While increasing
the model (or P ) space improves the quality of the calculation by including a larger part
of the correlation, it also increases the probability of encountering intruder states and
getting no valid results at all. New methods for improving convergence are therefore
highly desirable. One such method is presented in this Letter.

The problem may be illustrated by an example taken from recent work [9], where
ground and excited state energies of Hg and its ions were calculated by the relativistic
coupled cluster method. The 5d10 ground state of the Hg2+ ion served as the reference
state, and the Fock-space CC scheme was

Hg2+[(0)sector] → Hg+[(1)sector] → Hg[(2)sector],

(5)

with electrons added in the 6s and 6p orbitals, designated as valence particles. While
the calculations in [9] were relativistic, the nonrelativistic notation will be employed
for brevity. The model space in the (1) sector, with one valence particle, consisted
of determinants with 5d106s1 and 5d106p1 conﬁgurations. Adding the 7s, 7p, and 6d
orbitals to the list of valence particles would yield more state energies in the (1) sector,
as well as better description of the 6s16p1 states[9] in the (2) sector, corresponding to
neutral Hg. Unfortunately, adding the 5d107s1, 5d107p1, and 5d106d1 conﬁgurations
to the model space leads to divergence of the CC iterations (4) in the (1) sector.
Analysis shows that the divergence is caused by the 5d96s16p1, 5d96s2 and other intruder
states from the complementary Q space, which are close in energy to certain P states
(5d107p1, 5d106d1, and others). The diagonal elements Bii of the matrix B correspond
to diﬀerences between the total energies of the P and Q determinants connected by the
ti excitations. Some of these elements will be very small in this case, leading to large
elements in D−1. Small changes in t amplitudes on the right hand side of equations (4)
will therefore cause large changes in the amplitudes on the left hand side, leading to
divergence.

We propose to overcome this problem by replacing the D matrix by D′ which
includes, in addition to the diagonal elements of B, those nondiagonal B elements which
are large in comparison with corresponding diagonal elements. The calculation of all B
matrix elements is impractical, and a selection procedure for nondiagonal elements to
be included in D′ is described below. This new matrix is constructed so that its matrix
elements, D′
ij, are equal to or approximate the Bij matrix elements both for i = j and
for i, j ∈ I, where I is some small subset of the amplitudes. The other nondiagonal D′
ij
matrix elements (i 6∈ I or j 6∈ I) are set to zero. The method involves the inversion of
the partial matrix (IPM) D′. A modiﬁed form of the system of equations (4),

ti = −

(D′−1)ik[Ak +

i = 1, 2, . . . , N

is obtained and solved iteratively. Equations (6) can be divided into two sets,

ti = − X
k∈I

(D′−1)ik[Ak +

ti = −(D′−1)ii[Ai +

N
X
j=1

(B − D)ijtj − (D′ − D)iiti],

i 6∈ I, (8)

where the second part is similar to equations (4).

The size of the subset I must be kept small, so that the calculation (the most time-
consuming step), storage and manipulation of the non-zero oﬀ-diagonal D′ elements
remains feasible. Careful selection of the amplitudes to be included in I is therefore
of paramount importance. The algorithm followed here starts with calculating the ti
amplitudes by the standard iteration scheme (4). The amplitudes which have undergone
the largest changes are included in I, the corresponding D′
ij matrix elements are
evaluated, and the ti amplitudes in I are recalculated by equations (7). The dimension

Letter to the Editor

M of the I subset was kept at 1000, which makes the calculation and manipulation of
D′ feasible. Optimal algorithms for determining M, selecting excitations to be included
in I, and calculating the D′ matrix will be studied in the future.

It should be noted that the system (6) is equivalent to the standard equations (4)
in the limit M = 0; in the limit M = N, scheme (6) converges in one iteration, if one
takes D′

i = 1, 2, . . . , N.

Formally, one can always achieve convergence of the iterations (6) by increasing M.
The IPM method proposed here may be combined with other procedures for accelerating
convergence, such as the reduced linear equations [6] and direct inversion in the iterative
subspace [7, 8] methods. This has not been done in the present application, and will
be tried in the future. It should be mentioned that the identiﬁcation of the resulting
high-lying levels may require careful analysis of the t amplitudes, particularly if some
of the latter are large, indicating large contributions of Q conﬁgurations. Finally, it
should be noted that the IPM scheme described above may be regarded as adopting the
Gershgorn-Shavitt Ak perturbation theory approach rather than that of A0 [10].

The diﬀerent iteration schemes were tested for the 33-electron relativistic Fock-
space CC calculation with single and double cluster amplitudes of Hg+ levels in the
(spdf g) basis from [9] in the framework of the Dirac-Coulomb Hamiltonian. Two
model spaces were used, one consisting of determinants with 5d106s1 and 5d106p1
conﬁgurations, the other including in addition the 5d107s1, 5d107p1, and 5d106d1
conﬁgurations. All iterations involved 1:1 damping (the input amplitudes for iteration
n + 1 were taken as the average of input and output amplitudes of iteration n). The
IPM scheme is compared with the standard scheme (4) and with the RLE [6] and DIIS
[7, 8] methods in tables 1 and 2. The RLE and DIIS methods used the output of
the last ﬁve iterations to form the new input vector. All methods led to convergence
for the small model space (table 1). The RLE, DIIS, and IPM schemes were about
equally eﬀective in reducing the number of iterations required. The large model space
(table 2) shows markedly diﬀerent behavior for the diﬀerent methods. Straightforward
iteration by the Jacobi-type method blows up almost immediately; the large excitation
amplitudes may be traced to the intruder states mentioned above. The RLE and DIIS
schemes exhibit better behavior, but could not achieve convergence even after several
hundred iterations. Only the IPM approach proposed in this Letter led to convergence
(in the 29th iteration), showing the potential of the method.

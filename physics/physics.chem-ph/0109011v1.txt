Abstract

Using the reduced density matrix formalism the exciton scattering in light-harvesting

systems of purple bacteria is calculated. The static disorder (ﬂuctuations of the site

energies) as well as the dynamic disorder (dissipation) is taken into account in this

work. Circular aggregates with 18 pigments are studied to model the B850 ring of

bacteriochlorophylls with LH2 complexes. It can be shown that the inﬂuence of dis-

sipation may not be neglected in the simulation of the time-dependent anisotropy

of ﬂuorescence. Also an elliptical deformation of the ring could be essential.

1 Motivation

Highly eﬃcient light collection and excitation transfer to the reaction center

initiates the energy conversion in photosynthesis. This process takes place in

the so-called light-harvesting antenna network. Particularly, the ring subunit

of the peripheral light-harvesting antenna (LH2) [1] of purple bacteria has been

extensively studied [2]. The very symmetric arrangement with short distances

between the pigments gave new impulses to the discussion about coherence

in the exciton transfer and the exciton delocalization in LH2. Both could be

reduced by dynamic and static disorders.

Time-dependent experiments made it possible to study the femtosecond dy-

namics of the energy transfer and relaxation [3]. Kumble and Hochstrasser [4]

have presented a time-domain analysis of the eﬀects of the static disorder upon

the dynamics of optical excitations. The interpretation of time-dependent ex-

periments on the femtosecond time scale requires a theory which incorporates

static and dynamic disorder. The aim of the present paper is to extend the in-

vestigation by Kumble and Hochstrasser taking into account the simultaneous

inﬂuence of static and dynamic disorders after impulse excitation. In addition

we calculate the time-dependent anisotropy of ﬂuorescence not only for the

symmetric but also for elliptically distorted rings.

2 Model

The Hamiltonian

H = H 0

ex + Hph + Hex−ph + Hs + Hel

(1)

describes the transfer of a single exciton with a transfer integral J along the

ideal ring (H 0

ex), the independent heat baths for each chromophore (Hph), the

2

site–diagonal and linear interaction between the exciton and the bath (Hex−ph),

the static disorder (Hs) with Gaussian distribution (standard deviation ∆) and

elliptical distortion of the ideal ring (Hel).

Diagonalization of the Hamiltonian H 0

ex of the ideal ring leads to eigenstates |ki

and eigenenergies Ek = −2 J cos k. For a symmetrical coplanar arrangement

of site transition moments ~µn dipole-allowed transitions populate only the

degenerate k = ±1 levels of the ideal ring. If the ring is elliptically distorted the

eigenenergies of the Hamiltonian H 0

ex + Hel are no longer degenerate as is the

case for the ideal ring. With static disorder of the site energies being present

(∆ 6= 0), the stationary states, i.e. the eigenstates |ai of the Hamiltonian

H 0

ex + Hs, correspond to mixtures of |ki and an excitation will prepare a

superposition of the |ki states.

The dipole strength ~µa of state |ai of the ring with static disorder and the

dipole strength ~µα of state |αi of the ideal one read

~µa =

n~µn,

~µα =

cα
n~µn.

The coeﬃcients cα

n and cl

n are the expansion coeﬃcients of the eigenstates of

the ideal and disordered rings in site representation.

Kumble and Hochstrasser [4] concluded, that in the case of pump pulse exci-

tation the dipole strength is simply redistributed among the exciton levels due

to disorder. So the amplitudes of site excitations and the phase relationships

in the initial state are necessarily identical to that of an equal superposition

of k = ±1 excitons of the ideal ring. Thus, generally, the excitation with a

pump pulse of suﬃciently wide spectral bandwidth will always prepare the

same initial state, irrespective of the actual eigenstates of the real ring. The

nature of this initial state is entirely determined by the selection rules of the

ring without static disorder. The initial condition for the density matrix by

3

pulse excitation with the polarization ~ex is given by (Eq. (1a) in [5]):

ραβ(t = 0; ~ei) =

(~ex · ~µα)(~ex · ~µβ),

3 Anisotropy of ﬂuorescence

Kumble and Hochstrasser [4] calculated the usual time-dependent anisotropy

of ﬂuorescence

where, e.g.,

r(t) =

hSxx(t)i − hSxy(t)i
hSxx(t)i + 2hSxy(t)i

hSxy(t)i = h|

The indices α and l label the eigenstates of the virtual and disordered ring,

respectively. The brackets hi denote the ensemble average and the average over

the direction of the laser pulses with ﬁxed relative directions ~ex and ~ey.

To include the dynamic disorder which contributes to dephasing of the initial

wave packet and promotes thermalization of the dephased populations one has

to work within the exciton density matrix formalism [6] instead of using only

the exciton wave functions

Sxy(t) =

Pxy(ω, t)dω

Pxy(ω, t) = A

4 Density matrix formalism for exciton transfer and relaxation

Provided that the exciton dynamics is not very fast, its coupling to the bath
weak, and except for the initial time-interval t <∼ td (td = dephasing time of

the bath), the adequate equation for a factorized initial state is the Redﬁeld

equation [7,8]:

i

d
dt

1
¯h

ρ(t) =

[H, ρ(t)] + Rρ(t),

The Redﬁeld relaxation superoperator R describes the inﬂuence of the thermal

bath on the dynamics of the exciton.

ˇC´apek applied several diﬀerent ways of obtaining of convolutional and convo-

lutionless dynamical equations for the exciton density matrix in the site basis

[9]. After Markovian approximation they have the following form

i

d
dt

¯h

ρ(t) =

[H, ρ(t)] − δΩρ(t).

We proved [6] the equivalence of the Redﬁeld theory without secular approx-
imation with ˇC´apek’s equations after Markovian approximation.

5 Results

In Kumble and Hochstrasser’s modeling, the anisotropy of ﬂuorescence of the

ring LH2 subunit decreases from 0.7 to 0.3 −0.35 and subsequently establishes

a ﬁnal value of 0.4. Kumble and Hochstrasser concluded that one needs static

disorder of strength ∆ ≈ 0.4 − 0.8J to reach a time decay below 100 fs .

Our results for the time dependence (t = τ ¯h/J) of the anisotropy of ﬂuores-

cence Eq. (4) in the symmetrical ring are shown on Fig. 1 with static dis-

order ∆/J = 0.4. In addition we consider two strengths of dynamic disorder

j0 = 0.2, 0.4 entering the spectral density J(ω) = Θ(ω)j0

ω2
2ω3
c

e−ω/ωc with cut-oﬀ

frequency ωc = 0.2J [10]. Inclusion of dynamic disorder leads to faster decay

of the anisotropy of ﬂuorescence during the initial stage. Smaller strength of

the static disorder ∆/J than predicted by Kumble and Hochstrasser would be

necessary to guarantee the decrease of the anisotropy of ﬂuorescence during

the ﬁrst 100 fs.

It was concluded in Ref. [4] based on measurements by Chachisvilis et al. [11]

that the time decay of the anisotropy of ﬂuorescence during the ﬁrst dozens of

fs is temperature independent in the case of LH2 subunits. Our calculation for

the symmetrical ring show that such result can be obtained only for ∆ > 0.8.

But because the time resolution of the experiments in [11] was not too high

this very restrictive statement about the strength of the static disorder can

only be made with caution. We expect that some temperature dependence can

be seen using experiments with shorter laser pulses.

Recent results obtained by single molecule spectroscopy [12] can only be in-

terpreted [13] admitting the presence of a C2 distortion of the LH2 ring. It

has, up to now, not been concluded whether such C2 distortion of the LH2

ring is present also in samples in vivo.

We have made calculations which take into account the possible C2 distortion

of the ring using the model C by Matsushita et al. [13] of elliptical distortion

of the ring in which the transfer integral J is cosine modulated. Local tran-

sition dipole moments lie tangentially to the ellipse. Our results for the time

dependence of the anisotropy of ﬂuorescence (4) in the elliptically distorted

ring are shown on Fig. 2 with the static disorder ∆/J = 0.4 and the strength

of the dynamic disorder j0 = 0.2 for three values of the elliptical deformation

V2/J = 0.05, 0.1, 0.2.

It is seen, that the inclusion of an elliptical deformation leads to faster decay of

the anisotropy of ﬂuorescence and diminishes the inﬂuence of the dynamic dis-

6

order. Our calculation for the elliptically distorted ring (V2/J = 0.2 [13]) show

that the temperature independent time decay of the anisotropy of ﬂuorescence

during the ﬁrst dozens of fs can be obtained even for ∆ ≈ 0.4 .

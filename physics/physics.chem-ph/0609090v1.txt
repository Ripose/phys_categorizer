Abstract

A new stable pyrrolidine functionalized fullerene derivative, C69H10N2O2, has been synthesized, puriﬁed by high performance liquid
chromatography, and characterized by MALDI mass spectrometry, ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared, 1H
and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance. The magnetic properties of the analogous endohedral species have been studied by both
continuous wave (CW) and pulsed EPR. CW-EPR spectra indicated an anisotropic hyperﬁne interaction and a permanent zero-
ﬁeld-splitting (ZFS). Both CW and pulsed EPR showed the ZFS parameter Def f to be around 17 MHz. Pulsed EPR revealed a
biexponential decay in both T1 and T2, yielding a molecular tumbling correlation time τc of 31.4 ± 2.5 ps.

Key words: Pyrrolidine functionalized fullerene derivative, EPR, Anisotropic hyperﬁne interaction tensor, Zero ﬁeld splitting, Spin lattice

1. Introduction

Fullerenes which encapsulate atomic nitrogen (such as
N@C60) have been shown to contain an electron spin bene-
ﬁting from long relaxation times and narrow linewidths in
electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) (1). Such proper-
ties make N@C60 an attractive candidate building block for
a quantum information processing device (2) and a pow-
erful spin probe for measuring environments such as the
interior of nanotubes (3).

Relaxation in unmodiﬁed N@C60 has been found to
be driven by a vibrational Orbach mechanism (4). If the
fullerene is modiﬁed by a functional group in such a way
as to introduce a zero-ﬁeld-splitting (ZFS), the ﬂuctuation
of this ZFS due to molecular tumbling in liquid solution
provides an additional relaxation pathway characterized
by the magnitude of the ZFS, and the rotational correla-
tion time of the molecule. Thus, by measuring T1 and T2,
respectively the spin-lattice and phase memory relaxation
times, it is possible to probe the molecular dynamics of
fullerene derivatives in solution.

The ﬂuctuating ZFS mechanism is expected to produce
a biexponential decay in both T1 and T2, assuming the
molecule is not in the ‘fast-tumbling’ limit. Such a biexpo-
nential decay was not observed in earlier studies on fullerene
derivatives, reportedly due to limited signal to noise and
a relatively fast rotational correlation time. The eﬀect of
nuclear spins in the solvent may also have complicated the
analysis by adding additional relaxation pathways (5). The
observation of a biexponential decay is simpliﬁed by choos-
ing a bulky functional group, such as pyrrolidine, to slow
down the rotation further.

In this letter, we describe the synthesis of a new
pyrrolidine-functionalized fullerene derivative, C69H10N2O2,
and its analogous endohedral species, N@C69H10N2O2.
The product is puriﬁed by high performance liquid chro-
matography (HPLC), characterized by MALDI mass spec-
trometry, ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis), Fourier transform
infrared (FTIR), 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR) spectroscopies. We measure the ZFS and hyperﬁne
interaction of the electron spin arising from the addition
of the functional group to N@C60 using continuous wave
(CW) EPR. In contrast to previous reports of fullerene
derivatives (6; 7),
including pyrrolidine-functionalized
fullerenes, we observe an anisotropy in the 14N hyperﬁne
interaction in this species. Finally, we use pulsed EPR to

rotational correlation time τc of N@C69H10N2O2 in carbon
disulﬁde solution at room temperature.

N @C69H10N2O2: Method as for C69H10N2O2 using
N@C60/C60 (1/100) as starting material, the reaction was
carried out in the absence of light. The nitrogen EPR sig-
nal intensity of the product mixture is approximately 73%
of the initial signal.

EPR sample preparation: N@C69H10N2O2/C69H10N2O2
(around 7/1000) sample was dissolved in CS2, degassed,
and sealed in quartz EPR tubes (3 mm diameter).

CW EPR measurements were performed on a Mag-
nettech Miniscope MS200 using a 2 G modulation, 270 s
scan time, and 99 scans at room temperature. Spectral
simulation was performed using the EasySpin software
package (8).

Pulsed EPR measurements were performed using an X-
band Brucker Elexsys580e spectrometer. Spin lattice relax-
ation time T1 and spin dephasing time T2 were measured
by an inversion recovery sequence and Hahn echo sequence,

3. Results and Discussion

3.1. Synthesis and Characterization

A nitrobenzene functionalized fullerene, C69H10N2O2,
was synthesized according to the pyrrolidine functional-
ization method (9) (Fig.1). Brieﬂy, p-nitrobenzaldehyde,
N-methylglycine, and C60 were heated under reﬂux in
toluene for 2 h and subsequently puriﬁed by HPLC (Fig.2).
C69H10N2O2 elutes approximately 2 minutes earlier than
C60. Recycling mode HPLC was used to purify the product
to greater than 95%.

MALDI mass spectrometry revealed the expected molec-
ular ion peak at m/z 898.2 and an isotopic distribution pat-
tern in agreement with that calculated. UV-vis spectrum
features at 314 nm and 433 nm are indicative of pyrrolidine
functionalization and consistent with other pyrrolidiniza-
tion compounds (9; 10; 11; 12). Nitro group symmetric and
asymmetric stretching vibrations were observed in FTIR
at 1343 cm−1 and 1522 cm−1. Finally, 1H and 13C NMR
provide conﬁrmation of the structure. Four diﬀerent pro-
ton environments were found in the pyrrolidine ring. The
two proton environments, H-2a and H-2b, were found to be

(cid:13)
(cid:13)
Due to the low concentration of N@C69H10N2O2 within
C69H10N2O2, the spin exchange interaction between diﬀer-
ent molecules can be ignored.

The data is ﬁtted using the spin Hamiltonian:

H0 = ωeSz − ωIIz + ~S ·A·~I + ~S · ~D· ~S,

(1)

where ωe = gµBB0/~ and ωI = gI µN B0/~ are the electron
and 14N nuclear Zeeman frequencies, g and gI are the elec-
tron and nuclear g-factors, µB and µN are the Bohr and
nuclear magnetons, ~ = h/2π, h is Planck’s constant and
B0 is the magnetic ﬁeld applied along z-axis in the labora-
tory frame. A is the hyperﬁne interaction tensor, and ~D is
the ZFS tensor. The ZFS parameters D and E correspond
to the eigenvalues (x, y, z) of D = 3z/2, E = (y − x)/2.

The hyperﬁne coupling in N@C60 is isotropic and ap-
proximately 15.8 MHz — about 50% greater than that of
a free nitrogen atom (14). The fact that the central hyper-
ﬁne line (MI = 0) in the spectrum shows higher intensity
as compared to the two outer hyperﬁne lines (MI = ±1)
indicates that the 14N hyperﬁne coupling is anisotropic.

The spectrum is simulated (red line in Fig. 4) with
ZFS parameters D = 17.0 MHz and E = 0.8 MHz (con-
sistent with reports on other pyrrolidine-functionalized
fullerenes (6)) and hyperﬁne terms Axx = Ayy = 14.2 MHz,
Azz = 18.5 MHz. The functional group induces a dis-
tortion of the fullerene cage, removing the degeneracy
of the encased nitrogen p-orbital, resulting in an asym-
metric electron density distribution. This produces the
ZFS and an anisotropy in the hyperﬁne interaction. The
ZFS is about twice that of the methano-fullerene deriva-
tive N@C61(COOC2H5)2 (7), which is consistent with
the higher symmetry of that molecule compared with
N@C69H10N2O2.

3.3. Pulsed EPR

It has been shown that nuclear spins in the solvent en-
vironment provide a mechanism for electron spin relax-
ation (5). To probe the eﬀects of the functional group on
spin relaxation, it is important to use a solvent in which
there are no naturally abundant nuclear spins, such as car-
bon disulﬁde.

Fig. 5 shows relaxation measurements of T1 and T2 of
N@C69H10N2O2 in CS2 solution at room temperature,
taken using the central (MI =0) hyperﬁne line. In both
cases, the data were not well ﬁtted by purely monoexpo-
nential decay. Both T1 and T2 have two components cor-
responding to the ‘inner’ (MS = +1/2 : −1/2) and ‘outer’
(MS = ±3/2 : ±1/2) transitions in the S = 3/2 multiplet.
The relative amplitudes of the ‘inner’ and ‘outer’ contri-
butions to the total measured echo signal are 2:3. In the
case of an S = 3/2 spin system, a ﬂuctuating ZFS term
will lead to the following relaxation times (4; 15):

stereo diﬀerent and consistent with other pyrrolidinization
compounds (11; 12). Four inequivalent aromatic proton en-
vironments were also observed, one of which was found
to be broad resonance consistent with previously reported
compound (10). The 13C NMR spectrum of compound re-
vealed 50 sp2 and 2 sp3 environments relating to the C60
cage and an additional 3 pyrolidine sp3 and 4 nitrobenzene
sp2 carbon environments as expected.

The endohedral fullerene species N@C69H10N2O2 (Fig.3)
was prepared in an analogous fashion using N@C60/C60
(around 1/100).

The retention time of N@C69H10N2O2 is slightly longer
than that of C69H10N2O2 in the same way that N@C60
elutes more slowly than C60 (13). This was demonstrated
by measuring the EPR spin signal of the two halves of the
pure product eluting from HPLC. The ﬁrst half was found
to be spin silent and the second half spin active.

3.2. Continuous wave EPR

The CW EPR spectrum of N@C69H10N2O2 powder at
room temperature is shown in Fig. 4. Satellite peaks on ei-
ther side of the three principle lines are indicative of a ZFS.

tion correlation time of τc = 31.4 ± 2.5 ps and a ZFS term
Def f = 17.1 ± 0.5 MHz, matching well with that mea-
sured using CW EPR. The correlation time τc is longer
than that of reported fullerene derivatives and three times
that of N@C60 in toluene (7), showing that the bulky func-
tional group slows down the tumbling of the fullerene cage.
The rotation correlation time of a somewhat larger nitroxyl
derivative of C60 in a benzene-ethanol mixture was reported
to be 98 ps (16), measured by EPR of the nitroxyl radi-
cal. This much longer rotational time illustrates the role
of a solvent-solute interaction as an additional factor in
molecular tumbling rates, in which the polar nitroxyl group
plays a likely part. Thus, in molecular dynamics studies
of fullerene derivatives, the use of an endohedral N@C60
spin, rather than a nitroxyl group, as the eﬀective spin la-
bel avoids introducing potentially undesirable interactions
with the solvent.

Molecular tumbling in the presence of an anisotropic hy-
perﬁne interaction (HFI) provides an additional relaxation
mechanism, which can be observed by studying the outer
hyperﬁne lines (MI = ±1). Based on the hyperﬁne tensor
extracted from CW EPR, the contribution to phase relax-
ation from this mechanism is estimated to be of the order
of 100 µs (17; 18).

T2 was measured on the low-ﬁeld (MI = +1) hyperﬁne
line and found to have a biexponential decay, with compo-
nents T2,i=10.2 ± 0.7 µs and T2,o=2.9 ± 0.3 µs. While the
eﬀect on the faster T2,o component falls within experimen-
tal error, the eﬀect on T2,i is clear and consistent with the
additional relaxation mechanism of ﬂuctuating hyperﬁne
anisotropy. The eﬀect of ESEEM on this outer hyperﬁne
line (4) is negligible at these short relaxation times.

The measured T2 was ﬁtted to a biexponential de-
cay, y0 + Aiexp(-2τ /T2,i)+Aoexp(-2τ /T2,o), which pro-
duced two components with decay rates 12.3 ± 0.7 µs and
2.8 ± 0.2 µs, and relative amplitudes (Ai/Ao ≈ 2/3). The
coherence time (T2) of pristine N@C60 in these conditions
is 80 µs. Hence, the results suggest an additional relax-
ation mechanism aﬀecting the ‘inner’ and ‘outer’ rates
diﬀerently, such as that provided by a ﬂuctuating ZFS.

A new pyrrolidine functionalized fullerene derivative,
C69H10N2O2, was synthesized and puriﬁed by HPLC.
The structure was conﬁrmed by MALDI mass spectrom-
etry, UV-vis, FTIR, 1H NMR, and 13C NMR spectro-
scopies. The magnetic properties of the analogous species,
N@C69H10N2O2, were measured both by CW and pulsed
EPR at room temperature. CW EPR spectra indicate
that the functional group introduces a permanent ZFS
D = 17.0 MHz and an anisotropy in the hyperﬁne inter-
action. The presence of a ZFS and hyperﬁne anisotropy
was conﬁrmed by the observation of biexponential decays
in both T1 and T2 measurements using pulsed EPR. The
nitro functional group was found to slow down the molec-
ular tumbling in solution, with a correlation time τc of
31.4 ± 2.5 ps at room temperature, three times that of
N@C60 in toluene.

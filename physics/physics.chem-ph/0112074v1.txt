Enrichment of nuclear spin isomers by

molecular coherent control

Enrichment of nuclear spin isomers of molecules by infrared radiation resonant to

molecular rovibrational transition is considered. Special attention is given to the

enrichment by light-induced crossing of far separated ortho and para states.

INTRODUCTION

Nuclear spin isomers were discovered in the late 1920s when ortho and para H2 were

separated by deep cooling of hydrogen gas [1]. This technique was successful because of

extremely large gap between the ortho and para states in H2. Investigations of heavier

isomers were not possible to perform until recently because of the lack of appropriate

enrichment methods. First separation of heavy molecules (CH3F) was achieved using

the Light-Induce Drift eﬀect [2]. Later, the isomers of H2O [3], H2CO [4], Li2 [5], and

C2H4 [6] were enriched. A few practical applications of spin isomer are already known.

For example, isomers can aﬀect chemical reactions [7, 8], can signiﬁcantly enhance NMR

signals [9, 10], or can be used as spin labels in NMR based techniques.

Further investigations of nuclear spin isomers and progress in their applications need

new enrichment methods. This is rather diﬃcult and challenging task because physical

and chemical properties of spin isomers are almost identical. Recently new approach

to the isomer enrichment based on molecular excitation by strong electromagnetic ﬁeld

was proposed [11, 12, 13, 14]. In this paper we discuss the isomer enrichment based on

the coherent control by strong infrared radiation. We make emphasis on the conditions

necessary for the experimental observation of the phenomenon.

LEVEL SCHEME

The level scheme is shown in Fig. 1. We assume that test molecules have only two

nuclear spin states, ortho and para. This is very often the case, e.g., in CH3F [15, 16]. Each

of the two vibrational states (ground and excited) has one ortho-para level pair mixed

by intramolecular perturbation. Molecules are embedded into a “nonmagnetic” gaseous

environment characterized by zero cross-section for collisional ortho-para transition. The

infrared radiation is resonant to the rovibrational transition m

n of the ortho molecules.

−

The molecular Hamiltonian in our problem consists of four terms,

ˆH = ˆH0 + ¯h ˆHrad + ¯h ˆV + ¯h ˆV ′.

The main part, ˆH0, has the eigen ortho and para states shown in Fig. 1. ¯h ˆHrad describes

the molecular interactions with the external radiation that will be taken in the form of

monochromatic travelling wave,

ˆHrad =

2 ˆG cos(ωLt

kr);

ˆG = E0 ˆd/2¯h,

−

−

where E0; ωL and k are the amplitude, frequency and wave vector of the electromagnetic
wave, respectively; ˆd is the molecular electric dipole moment operator. ˆV and ˆV ′ are the

intramolecular perturbations that mix the ortho and para states in excited and ground

vibrational states, respectively. These perturbations originate from the nuclear spin-spin

and spin-rotation interactions [17, 18, 19, 20].

Suppose that a test molecule is placed initially in the ortho subspace of the ground

vibrational state. Due to collisions the molecule will undergo fast rotational and velocity
relaxation inside the ortho subspace. This will proceed until the molecule jumps to the
state m′, which is mixed with the para state k′ by the intramolecular perturbation ˆV ′ (see

Fig. 1), or to the state n which is mixed with the para state k by the combined action of
the external ﬁeld and intramolecular perturbation ˆV . Admixture of a para state implies

that the next collision can move the molecule to another para states and thus localize it

inside the para subspace. The spin conversion occurs.

The molecular center-of-mass motion aﬀects the process because of the Doppler eﬀect.

Vibrational degree of freedom plays an important role too. After ortho-para transition in

3

upper vibrational state the molecule relaxes to the ground vibrational state. Consequently,
k′ channel. It is essential
back conversion can only occur through the unperturbed m′

−

that conversion through the m

k channel can be substantially aﬀected by electromagnetic

radiation.

−

Quantitative description of the isomer conversion can be done using the perturbation

theory [21]. The zeroth-order theory neglects the intramolecular ortho-para state mixing
by ˆV and ˆV ′ and thus contains no ortho-para conversion.

In this approximation an

external ﬁeld does not aﬀect the population of para states. The populations of ortho

states in the model of strong collisions read,

ρo(e, j, v) = ρo

p(Ω)τevwjf (v) + p(Ω, v)[τetwj + τeδjm]

Here ρo is the total concentration of ortho molecules; e, g designate the excited and ground

vibrational states, respectively; j is the rotational quantum number; wj is the Boltzmann

distribution; f (v) is the Maxwell distribution and v is the molecular center-of-mass ve-

locity. The level populations in Eq. (3) are split into the terms nonequilibrium in j and

v, nonequilibrium only in v, and equilibrium in j and v. The magnitudes of these terms

are proportional to speciﬁc relaxation parameters τ ’s (see Ref. [21] for more details). The

function p(Ω, v) is the excitation probability of molecules with particular velocity v and

ENRICHMENT

The ﬁrst-order theory takes the intramolecular perturbations ˆV and ˆV ′ into account.

In this approximation the spin conversion appears and it can be aﬀected by the radiation.

An external radiation changes the concentration of ortho molecules from the equilibrium

value, ρo(0), to the steady-state value, ρo. Because the total concentration of the test

molecules is conserved, one has steady-state enrichment of para molecules [21],

One can see from Eqs. (8), (9), and (10) that the conversion rate, γ, has two peaks. The

peak at the absorption line center (Ω = 0) appears because the excitation probabilities,

p(Ω) and p(Ω, v), have maximum at Ω = 0. The homogeneous width of this peak is equal

to ΓB that can be very large in molecular systems due to the slow rotational, velocity,

and vibrational relaxations. The peak at Ω =

ω1 is due to the light-induced crossing

−

of m and k states (see Ref. [13, 14, 21]) and appears formally because of the resonant

denominators in the integrands in Eq. (9) and (10). The homogeneous width of the peak

at Ω =

ω1 is equal to Γ1.

−

Coherent control allows to achieve substantial enrichment if the mixing in ground

and vibrationally excited states has the same order of magnitude [21]. On the other

hand, close coincidences between ortho and para states in molecules are rather rare.

Consequently, such close level pairs in excited vibrational state may be absent, or they

cannot be accessible by the available radiation. Below we estimate the enrichment in the

case of large ortho-para gap in excited state, ω

The terms γn(0) and γcoh(0) have the “oﬀ-resonant” nature which manifests itself by the

large ortho-para gap, ω, in the denominators. At large ω, the conversion rate, γ(0), is
determined mainly by γ′

n(0) and the radiation depletes the para molecules,

This is analogous to the enrichment by light-induced population change [11, 12]. Maxi-

mum of β(0) is achieved at suﬃciently strong ﬁeld, ΓB

Depending on the relaxation scheme and the origin of the relaxation “bottle neck”, one

can achieve diﬀerent level of enrichment. In the most favorable situation of fast velocity

and rotational relaxations the enrichment reaches -1/4.

Larger enrichment can be achieved at the level-crossing resonance. The ﬁeld-dependent

rates at the Ω =

values of ω are shown in Fig. 2. The calculations were done using the exact expressions

for the conversion rates, (7)–(10). In this numerical example the following parameters
were used [21], V = 3 kHz, V ′ = 5 kHz, Γ = 2 MHz, ω′ = 130 MHz, kv0 = 30 MHz;
τ1 = 5 MHz−1; τ2 = 1 MHz−1 and all Boltzmann factors equal, wm = wn = wk = wm′ =
wk′ = 10−2.

DISCUSSION

Conditions necessary for the experimental observation of the light-induced enrichment

are not easy to fulﬁl. First of all, the ﬁeld free conversion rate, γf ree, of the molecules

7

under consideration should be low in order to enhance the role of light-induced changes

in the total rate, γ. Note that the rate γf ree should combine all signiﬁcant contributions,

e.g., caused by the molecular collisions with the walls of the gas container. At present,

only in a few rare cases (see the Introduction) the rates γf ree are known.

Next task is to determine the target ortho-para level pair in the excited vibrational

state. For this, one has to know rather accurately the relative positions of ortho and para

states and the intramolecular ortho-para mixing eﬃciency as well.

Perhaps, the most diﬃcult problem is to ﬁnd powerful radiation having right frequency.

The most promising sources of such radiation are the powerful Free Electron Lasers.

Formation and dynamics of an Al(OH)3 precipitation ring is studied by diﬀusing NaOH into a
gel containing AlCl3. Limited feeding of the outer electrolyte (NaOH) is found to yield an intricate
ring-dynamics which involves stopping and reversal of the direction of motion of the precipitation
ring, and evolution into stationary multi-ring structures. A model of the ring-dynamics is developed
by combining a phase separation scenario for the precipitation with the redissolution (complex
formation) of the precipitate in the excess of the outer electrolyte.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Precipitation patterns formed in the wake of moving
reaction fronts have been studied for a long time [1]. Re-
cent interest in these structures stems from possible rel-
evance to engineering mesoscopic and microscopic pat-
terns [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. In contrast to removing material to
construct a structure (top-down processing), controlled
precipitation is suggested as means to generate a pre-
scribed bulk design (bottom-up processing).
In order
to understand how to guide and locate precipitation re-
gions, it is instrumental to investigate cases where, in
addition to precipitation in the reaction zone, redisso-
lution in the wake of the moving front also takes place
[7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. The resulting virtual mo-
tion of a precipitation pulse (or more complicated pat-
tern) is easily visualized and its dynamics can be studied
in detail.

In a usual setup for observing moving precipitation
pulses, the inner electrolyte is distributed homogeneously
in a gel column and the outer electrolyte diﬀuses into
this medium (typical examples of inner/outer electrolyte
pairs are Hg2+/I−, Co2+/NH4OH, Cr3+/OH−). The
precipitate (HgI2, Co(OH)2, Cr(OH)3) forms in the re-
action zone which moves diﬀusively along the column.
In the wake of this front, the excess of the outer elec-
trolyte consumes the precipitate and forms a complex
([HgI4]2−, [Co(NH3)6]2+, [Cr(OH)4]−).
In cases when
the gel, the reagents, and the complex are transparent,
while the precipitate is not, the position of the precipi-
tation pulse (band) is easily monitored.

Our aim here is to study the dynamics of precipitation
pulses in radially symmetric, two-dimensional setup with
limited feeding of the outer electrolyte. From experimen-
tal side, we present a quantitative description of the ra-
dial motion of precipitation pulses with emphasis on the

stopping of the band and on the reversal of the radial
motion with the ensuing multiplication of the precipita-
tion bands. From theoretical side, we generalize the so
called phase separation theory of Liesegang phenomena
[19], and show that the novel aspects of the experiments
(reversal of front motion and the multiplication of bands)
can be described well but problems arise when such de-
tail as the time-evolution of the width of the precipitation
band is considered.

II. EXPERIMENTS

The evolution of the precipitation pulse is observed in

the following reaction scheme [14]:
Al3+(aq) + 3OH−(aq)
Al(OH)3(s) + OH−(aq)

→

→

Al(OH)3(s)
[Al(OH)4]−(aq).

Agarose (Reanal) was dissolved in distilled water to pro-
duce 1% solution. It was continuously stirred and heated
up to 90 oC. The clear solution was mixed with the given
amount of AlCl3*6H20 (Reanal), and this solution was
poured into a Petri dish to obtain a uniformly thick
gel (3.2 mm). After polymerization, a circular hole of
radius R is cut out at the center of the gel, and the
outer electrolyte of ﬁxed concentration (a0 = 2.50M) was
placed into this reservoir. No feeding of the outer elec-
trolyte (usual boundary conditions in many experiments
and simulations) was allowed. The parameters varied in
the experiments were the concentration of the inner elec-
trolyte (b0) and the radius of the reservoir (R). When
changing R, the volume V0 of the outer electrolyte was
changed proportionally to R2.

Shortly after the outer electrolyte is placed into the
reservoir, a white precipitate can be observed at the
gel-reservoir interface. Next, the thin precipitation ring
detaches from the interface (due to redissolution of the
precipitate in the wake of the outward moving reaction
front). The precipitation band is well visible because
both the aluminum chloride and its hydroxo complex are
colorless in contrast to the white precipitate, Al(OH)3.

At early stages, the increase of radius of the pulse rf (t)

is proportional to the square root of time rf (t)
indicating that the front motion is driven by diﬀusion of
the invading electrolyte. Then the front motion slows
down (faster than in case of continuous feeding) and, ﬁ-
nally, the front stops (Figure 1a). The total increase
R depends on the concentrations

FIG. 1: Radius (a) and width (b) of the precipitation ring
plotted as a function of √t with time measured in seconds.
The position of both the leading edge and the back of the ring
are plotted on (a) for various radii (R) of the reservoir where
the outer electrolyte is conﬁned initially.

The width w(t) of the pulse shows a more complicated
behavior (Figure 1b). It increases up to a maximum value
and, as the front signiﬁcantly slows, it starts to decrease.
In this regime, the precipitation stops at the outer edge
of the pattern, the reason being that the limited feeding
cannot maintain the necessary concentration for the for-
mation of the precipitate. Nevertheless, even the limited
feeding is suﬃcient for the complex formation in the wake
of the front, and w decreases.

Similar sequence of events can be observed at ﬁxed
R (ﬁxed amount of the outer electrolyte) when varying
the concentration of the inner electrolyte (Figure 2). The

FIG. 2: The same as on Fig.1 a and b but for various initial
concentration of the inner electrolyte. The radius of the con-
tainer where the outer electrolyte is initially conﬁned is also
kept constant (R = 0.5cm).

eﬀect of concentration of the electrolytes on front velocity
has been studied in previously [7, 12], and it was found
that the velocity of pattern formation is higher at lower
concentration of the inner electrolyte. Here we ﬁnd that
lowering of concentration of the inner electrolyte mainly
aﬀects the temporal evolution of the width. Namely, for
√t behavior can be seen
very low concentrations, w(t)
all the way to the time when the pulse stops. We do not
have an explanation for this. The observation that the
concentration of the precipitate visibly decreases at the
outer edge of the front, however, suggests that a colloidal
re-transformation of the precipitation ring compensates
the complex formation which would otherwise decrease
the width.

∼

An interesting phenomenon can be observed after the
precipitation pulse stops. As shown in Fig.3, a new well-
separated ring emerges inside the stationary pulse.
It
appears that the precipitation front reverses its motion.
Supporting the picture of the reversal of the front is
that a third ring with even smaller radius forms after
a while and, furthermore, the outer rings do not get dis-
solved. This means that the outer electrolyte is conﬁned
to regions with radius smaller than that of the station-

It should be noted that reversal of reaction
front motion (actually several switches in the direction
of the motion) have been seen and discussed previously
[16, 17, 18]. The emphasis of our work is on the motion of
the precipitation pulse which is related to the dynamics
of the reaction front but it is more complex due to the
phase separation and redissolution eﬀects.

III. THE MODEL AND THE SIMULATION
RESULTS

≡
Al3+, respectively, the ﬁrst stage of the
C, yields a reaction product C

In order to model the phenomena described in Sec.II,
let us ﬁrst note that the reactions take place in a gel.
Thus, no convection is present, and the primary dy-
namics is a slow reaction-diﬀusion process. Denoting
the reagents of the outer- and inner-electrolytes by A
OH− and B
process, 3A + B
≡
Al(OH)3. The next step is the formation of precipitate
which will be modeled as phase separation of C into low-
and high-concentration regions of C as described by the
Cahn-Hilliard equation. A similar strategy has been suc-
cessfully employed in the theory of Liesegang phenomena
[19, 20] where the above two steps constitute the whole
pattern formation process. The new element here is that
the outer electrolyte forms a complex with the precipitate
[Al(OH)4]−). The complex formation is
(A + C
responsible for the redissolution of C and, consequently,
for the moving precipitation band. For simplicity, we
shall assume that, once the complex is formed, it ceases
to play any active role in the reactions. This assumption
appears to be justiﬁed in the given experiment.

Here Da, Db are the diﬀusion coeﬃcient of A and B, re-

spectively, k and g are the reaction rate constants, λ is

separation process. The phase separation is governed by
a free energy functional f (c) with two minima in homoge-
neous states corresponding to the equilibrium high- (ch)
0) concentrations of C (which are assumed
and low- (cl ≈
to be the band- and interband-concentrations of C). The
usual form of this functional is the Landau-Ginzburg free
energy with a functional derivative of the following form

where u0, v0, and ¯c are phenomenological parameters
chosen so that the minima of f (c) are at cl and ch, while
w0 governs the scale for the width of the interface be-
tween the regions of cl and ch. The values of these pa-
rameters are not known (note that since the values of cl
and ch, and the width of the interface regions are not
measured, the values of u0, v0, and w0 are not ﬁxed in
the given experiment).

According to the experiments, the outer- (inner-) elec-
trolytes of concentrations a0 (b0) are initially homoge-
neously distributed inside (outside) of a circle of radius
R. Thus, denoting the radial coordinate by r, the initial
conditions to equations (1-3) are as follows

where θ(x) is the step function. The radial symme-
try is not broken during the evolution of the precipita-
tion pattern and, consequently, we can limit the solution
of equations (1-3) to radially symmetric concentration
ﬁelds a(r, t), b(r, t), and c(r, t). The reduction to a one-
dimensional problem greatly simpliﬁes the numerical so-
lution of the equations and even a simple Euler scheme
is suﬃciently fast and stable to obtain the time evolution
of the system.

The diﬃculty lies in the number of phenomenologi-
cal parameters. Setting the concentration scale and the
length-scale by a0 and R, respectively, using a timescale

FIG. 4: Formation of multiple bands after reversal of the reaction front. First panel shows the line-assignment to the outer
(B) and inner (A) electrolytes, and to the precipitate (C). Detailed explanation of the process can be found in the text. The
above ﬁgures were obtained by solving eqs.(1) using the following parameters: a0 = 25, b0 = 0.4, u = 0.15, v = 550, w = 1,
k = 4, g = 0.005, and R = 350.

which yields DA = 1, and making a further simpliﬁca-
tion by assuming DB = DA, one still has ﬁve parameters
(u = λu0, v = λv0, w = λw0, k, g). The values of these
parameters are not known and they can change by sev-
eral orders of magnitudes in various systems. Thus, one
faces the problem of searching for agreement with the ex-
periment in a ﬁve-dimensional parameter space. This is
a highly nontrivial problem, and we began by restricting
our search to qualitative solutions explaining the most
interesting part of the experiment, namely the reversal
of the motion of front and the generation of stationary
bands in the wake of it.

−

−

−

Fig.4 shows the details of dynamics of the reversal
and the formation of multiple bands. As the outer elec-
trolyte A is depleted, the reaction front stops and, as a
result, the outer edge of the precipitate ceases moving
150). Then, due to dissolution, the outer edge
(t = 100
starts to move backward (t = 150
200) and the band
becomes narrower. As the reaction front reverses its mo-
tion, the precipitation takes place behind the outer edge
240). During this stage, a complicated inter-
(t = 200
play of reaction-precipitation-dissolution yields a double
peak band structure. As the reaction front moves in fur-
ther, the inner edge of the band starts to move in as well
250). Now, the concentration of A is still large
(t = 240
enough behind the front to dissolve part of the band, and
a band-splitting takes place (t = 250). As the front moves
in further, the inner band follows it and the A-s are so
much depleted in the wake of the front that they are not
able to dissolve the outer band (t = 250
300). From this
point on, the process is similar to usual Liesegang band
formation [19]: the reaction product of the moving front
phase separates in the wake of the front, and the bands
formed in this way are stable since the dissolution is neg-
ligible due to the depletion of the A-s (t = 300
350).
The band formation stops once the concentration of the
reaction product in the front decreases below a threshold

Once qualitative agreement is found, a quantitative
comparison with the experiments may also be attempted.
E.g. the time-evolution of the radius rf (t) and width w(t)
of the pulse can be calculated and measured in detail. We
did this in a regime where the concentrations of a0 and
b0 are chosen such that the front just driven out, then
stops, and no reverse motion takes place. Fig.5a shows a
set of experimental and theoretical results for time evo-
lution of the front position, rf (t) scaled by the radius of
the initial interface (R). The scaling by R is suggested
by calculating the ﬁnal position of the front [rf (
)] by
ﬁnding the radius of area where the B-s are in suﬃcient
number to consume all the A-s. This calculation suggests
)/R is constant, independent of R. As can be
that rf (
seen from Table 1, the relationship rf (
)/R = constant
is indeed satisﬁed.

On Fig.5a, the radius of the pulse is plotted against
t1/2/R and good collapse is found for both experimen-
tal and theoretical curves for various R-s. This shows
that although the front motion is not simply diﬀusive,
the front dynamics has the scale-invariance of diﬀusive
processes, and the theoretical model captures this as-
pect correctly. Note that the agreement between the
experiment and theory is also excellent. The collapse
is achieved for the experimental ratio of initial concen-
trations (b0/a0 = 0.016) by ﬁnding an appropriate set

of reaction rates and Landau coeﬃcients, and using a
scale factor to relate the experimental and theoretical
timescales (see caption to Fig.5).

·

Problems arise in the quantitative description of the
width of the precipitation zone. As can be seen on Fig.5b,
the agreement between theory and experiment is at most
qualitative. While both widths grow initially and then
show a decreasing trend, there are important diﬀerences.
The theoretical widths are signiﬁcantly larger and, fur-
thermore, they reach their maxima well before the band
stops [t1/2/R
200, see Fig.5a]. This is in contrast to the
experimental widths which increase almost to the end of
the band motion. The narrower experimental widths may
be explained by the uncertainties of what is measured in
the experiment as compared to the theory. The shift of
the maxima, however, is harder to explain. The under-
lying reason may be the simplicity of the Landau free

≈

energy where the u0 and v0 set a constant concentration
of C in the band. Visual observations, however, indicate
that the structure of the band and thus the concentration
in them is changing during the evolution. Consequently,
u0 and v0, and perhaps λ and w0 as well, are functions
of the local concentration of A.

The a-dependence of the free energy is an interesting
problem and the solution may also be relevant for
building a more powerful theory of Liesegang phe-
nomena [21, 22].
Indeed, the explanation of the so
called width-law of Liesegang phenomena is based
on phase-separation scenario with an underlying free
energy. A consequence of this theory is the constancy of
the precipitate concentration in the bands which is not
always seen in experiments [23]. A natural explanation
is again in the generalization of the free energy. At this
point, however, one would need more experimental input
to build a more complicated model. This is outside the
scope of this letter.

IV. FINAL REMARKS

We have investigated a precipitation process where
limited feeding of the invading electrolyte, precipitation,
and a complex-formation process combine to yield a pre-
cipitation pulse with nontrivial motion and with the pos-
sibility of evolution into a multi-band structure. An
explanation for the various phenomena can be found
through the reaction front dynamics governed by the di-
rection of the higher transport ﬂux of electrolytes.
In
contrast to classical setups where the high initial concen-
tration of the outer electrolyte ensures its dominant ﬂux
into inner electrolyte, the limited feeding of the exter-
nal electrolyte produces a reaction-front reversal. As a
consequence, a Liesegang type band-formation is devel-
oped in direction of the source of the external electrolyte.
Presumably, this type of reaction-front reversals under-
lie the explanation of several seemingly revert Liesegang
structures in chemistry and geoscience. The experimen-
tal results have been described using a phase separation
scenario for the precipitation formation and adding the
process of redissolution through complex formation. The
model captures all important features and, we believe,
it may be the basis for understanding rather complex
Liesegang type precipitation patterns.

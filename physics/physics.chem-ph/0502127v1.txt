In this work, the memory equation approach is applied for theoretical study of dynamics of
polar molecular liquids described by the interaction site model. The study includes the tempe-
rature-density(pressure) dependence of the translational diﬀusion coeﬃcients D and orientational
relaxation times τ for inﬁnitely dilute solutions of acetonitrile and methanol in water, and methanol
in acetonitrile. Calculations are performed over the range of temperatures and densities employing
the SPC/E model for water and optimized site-site potentials for acetonitrile and methanol. Despite
an approximate character of the model potentials and closure relation used, the theory is able
to reproduce qualitatively all main features of temperature and density dependences of D and τ
observed in computer and real experiments. In particular, anomalous behavior, i.e. the increase in
mobility with density(pressure), is obtained for D and τ of methanol in water, while acetonitrile in
water or methanol in acetonitrile do not show deviations from the usual. The observed enhancement
in the molecular mobility is interpreted in accordance with the concept by Yamaguchi et al. [J. Chem.
Phys. 119 (2003) 1021], i.e. in terms of two competing origins of friction, which interplay with each
other as density increases: the collisional and dielectric frictions that have tendency, respectively,
to strengthen and weaken with increasing density.

INTRODUCTION

The enhancement of the molecular mobility of polar
molecules in dense dipolar liquids under pressure, called
anomalous molecular mobility, has recently attracted
considerable attention in solution chemistry experiments
and simulations [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. Conventional
continuum-based theories of liquid matter collapsed when
applied for the description of anomalous molecular be-
havior, so that to make theoretical justiﬁcation of the
observed processes is topical from the point of view sta-
tioned on the statistical mechanical approach [10].
In
order to clarify the microscopic structure of water, which
is a typical representative of a liquid with anomalous be-
havior, and its mobility,
it has been studied recently
by Yamaguchi et al. using the memory equation ap-
proach for molecular liquids described by the interaction
site model [11]. The authors concluded, that anomalous
pressure dependence of dynamic properties of water can
be explained by the strong interatomic Coulomb interac-
tion correlated with density ﬂuctuations. In particular,
when the number-density ﬂuctuation in the low wave-
number region decreases with increasing pressure, the
Coulomb coupling between the low wave-number charge-
density ﬂuctuation and hydrodynamic dielectric mode is
reduced. In the case of another polar liquids, like acetoni-
trile, the eﬀect of Coulomb interaction can be blocked by
even more substantial repulsive interaction, which makes

it dissimilar with water. Phrasing it diﬀerently – anoma-
lous molecular mobility strongly depends on the molec-
ular geometry and dominant type of interatomic inter-
action, and more studies is required for better under-
standing of its nature. In this paper we pay attention to
the study of anomalous pressure behavior of polar binary
molecular solutions by considering such popular models
as methanol in water, acetonitrile in water and methanol
in acetonitrile. In particular, we are interested in the den-
sity(pressure) dependence of translational diﬀusion coef-
ﬁcients and reorientation relaxation times of solutes. The
rest of the paper is organized as follows. In section II we
write down equations of motion for site-site intermediate
scattering functions, and give relations for translational
diﬀusion coeﬃcient and reorientation correlation time in
terms of these functions. Equilibrium properties of the
system are obtain using DRISM, and memory kernels are
estimated by the mode-coupling approximation. Set up
for systems under consideration and details of numerical
procedures are described in section III. Obtained results
are discussed in section IV, and conclusions are given in
section V.

II. THEORY

For the description of time-dependent properties of the
system, we will follow the formalism by Hirata and Chong
[12], which is the uniﬁcation of the theory of dynamical
processes in simple liquids based on the Mori approach
[13, 14] and reference interaction site model for molec-
ular liquids [15, 16, 17]. In their formalism, parameters
of shortened description of the system are partial num-

2

ber densities and longitudinal current densities. Then,
of practical interest are elements of the matrix of the
site-site intermediate scattering functions F(k; t) and the
matrix of their self-parts Fs(k; t) deﬁned by

where N is the total number of particles, ρα(k; t) is the
site α number density in reciprocal space, k is the wave-
vector, k =
means complex conjuga-
tion, angular brackets denote appropriate statistical ave-
rage (e.g., canonical Gibbs ensemble average), and suﬃx
“s” stands for “self” and means correlations between two
sites of a same molecule. In the limit of inﬁnite dilution,
which is considered here, the solution density is essen-
tially determined by the solvent. Consecutively, one has
two types of memory equations for the solvent subsys-
tem and one for the solute subsystem (indicated by the
superscript “u”) which are:

u(k) is similar to the one given by equation (4)
tion for J
with the diﬀerence that summation runs over the solute
molecule only.
Initial values of intermediate scattering
functions, that we need to solve memory equations (2),
can be obtained using RISM theory [15, 16, 17]. That
theory predicts static structure of molecular ﬂuids via the
calculation of their site-site pair correlation functions. In
this work, however, in order to have a better descrip-
tion for the dielectric susceptibility of solvent we employ
the formalism of DRISM that uses experimental value of
dielectric constant [19, 20].

Quantities of our interest in this paper are solute’s
translational diﬀusion coeﬃcient D and rank-1 reorien-
tation correlation time τ . Following the derivation pro-
cedure presented in [21], the translational diﬀusion coef-
ﬁcient D is obtained as

Since the dynamics we are interested in corresponds to
the long-time limit, memory kernels for memory equa-
tions can be constructed using the mode-coupling ap-
proximation [23]. In works by Chong et al. [24, 25] the
conventional mode-coupling theory has been extended to
the case of molecular liquids based on the interaction-site
model. It has been shown, however, that the proposed

in orientational motions [26].
In our study we use the
recipe by Yamaguchi and Hirata [26], who suggested a
modiﬁed expression that includes the interaxial coupling.

no experimental values exist. For density and dielectric
constant of acetonitrile at diﬀerent temperatures we used
experimental values indicated in Table I.

III. DETAILS OF THE MODEL SETUP AND
NUMERICAL PROCEDURES

We performed calculations for acetonitrile in water,
methanol in water and methanol in acetonitrile, all in
the case of inﬁnite dilution. As for the structure and the
intermolecular potential of water we employed a model
of the extended simple point charge (SPC/E) [27]. We
also put the Lennard-Jones (LJ) core on the hydrogen
atoms in order to avoid the undesired divergence of the
solution of the DRISM integral equation. The LJ param-
eters of the hydrogen atom, the depth of the well and the
diameter, were chosen to be 0.046 kcal/mol and 0.7 ˚A,
respectively.

In acetonitrile and methanol the methyl group was
considered to be a single interaction site located on the
methyl carbon atom. So that all chemical compounds
consisted of three sites which interact through the pair
potential [28, 29]

Point charges for acetonitrile were chosen to reproduce
electrostatic potential obtained in ab initio calculations
[28].

In calculations for acetonitrile or methanol in water
temperature of the system was varied from 258.15 to
373.15 K, and density of water from 0.9 to 1.2 g/cm3; for
the case of methanol in acetonitrile temperature of the
system was varied from 293.15 to 323.15 K, and density
of acetonitrile from 0.6726 to 0.815 g/cm3. Connection of
the water parameters with thermodynamic pressure can
be established, e.g., using the multi-parametric equation
of state [30] (except for the metastable regions where re-
liable data is lacking).

In the numerical part of this study we calculated ﬁrst
the site-site static structure factor by solving the DRISM
equation using the intermolecular interaction, molecular
shape, temperature and density.
In order to improve
the convergence of the DRISM calculation, we used the
method of the modiﬁed direct inversion in an iterative
space (MDIIS) proposed by Kovalenko et al.
[37]. The
value of the parameter of DRISM theory a has been set to
0.1 ˚A2. From the static site-site structure factor, we cal-
culated the site-site intermediate scattering function us-
ing the site-site memory equation with the mode-coupling
approximation for the memory kernels. The memory
equation has been time-integrated numerically. Time-
development of correlation functions in the k
0 limit
was treated separately by the analytical limiting proce-
dure of theoretical expressions.
In the numerical pro-
cedure, the reciprocal space was linearly discretized as
k = (n + 1
1.
Values of ∆k and Nk are 0.061 ˚A−1 and 29 = 512, respec-
tively. The choice for Nk as the power of two came as the
requirement of the subroutine for the fast Fourier trans-
form, which has been used in DRISM / MDIIS. The dif-
fusion coeﬃcient D was calculated from the asymptotic
slope of the time dependence of the mean square dis-
placement, and the orientational relaxation time τ was
obtained by time-integration of the rotational autocorre-
lation function.

IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

A. Structural properties

When applied to the liquid state, external pressure
induces changes both in its structure and dynamics of
molecules. The anomalous behavior of the molecular mo-
bility with pressure, i.e. dynamics, has been assigned to
the hydrogen bonding properties of the system, which in
its turn can be related to structural properties. The idea
is that the hydrogen bond or hydrogen bonding network
are distorted upon compression, so that the molecule has
less hydrogen bonds at higher pressure, which makes its
translational and rotational motion looser. On the other
hand, extensive compression results in signiﬁcant grow
In fact, the liq-
of repulsive forces between molecules.

peting factors: hydrogen bonding and repulsive interac-
tion, which interfere each other through the intramolec-

we can focus our analysis on some properties related to
the subject. Figs. 1 – 4 show site-site RDF’s for neat wa-
ter, water-methanol, water-acetonitrile and acetonitrile-
methanol inﬁnite dilution solutions, respectively, calcu-
lated by the DRISM/NHC theory for set of densities at
constant temperature. Despite the comparatively big
number of site-site combinations, there are some com-
mon features in the behavior of each individual site-site
RDF, that can be categorized as follows. First, one sees
that there are RDF’s with the ﬁrst peak either remained
almost unchanged, or enhanced with the increase of den-
sity(pressure). Second, there are ﬁrst peaks that are lo-
cated at positions much shorter, than other peaks, and
that all of them subside with density(pressure) a lot. The
former case is a reﬂection of packing eﬀect. It is because
of the result of pressure pushes the next nearest neighbor
toward the central molecule and makes the ﬁrst coordina-
tion shell to be outlined more clearly, which is also con-
ﬁrmed by the drift of majority of peak locations into di-
rection of shorter separations. The eﬀect of pressure also
distorts the preferable mutual orientation of molecules,
which does not favor hydrogen bonds. The latter case

in given previously peak categorization is an example of
such state of things. To be more speciﬁc, ﬁrst peaks in
Figs. 1(b), 2(b) and 2(e), 3(d), and 4(b) all are evidences
of hydrogen bonds in the system, and all of them subside
with the increase of density. There is, however, a diﬀer-
ence in their nature. For methanol in water the hydrogen
bonding is realized in two ways: once when the proton
acceptor is solvent, i.e. water, Fig. 2(b); and once when
the proton acceptor is the solute, i.e. methanol, Fig. 2(e).
In the ﬁrst case the peak amplitude is much lower, than
in the second case, indicating that the ﬁrst type of hy-
drogen bonding may be somewhat weaker. Nevertheless,
due to the fact that both solvent and solute can evident
as both proton donor and acceptor, they are able to make
either hydrogen bond network, as in the case of neat wa-
ter, or hydrogen bond zigzag chains, as in the case of
pure methanol or water-methanol mixture. For acetoni-
trile in water the hydrogen bonding is realized only in one
way: when the nitrogen site of acetonitrile serves as the
proton acceptor, Fig. 3(d). The peak amplitude of that
hydrogen bond is also lower compared to neat water, Fig.
1(b), or water-methanol, Fig. 2(e), but general behavior

g/cm3 for acetonitrile, obtained by the DRISM/HNC theory. In the notations used, ﬁrst site always belongs to acetonitrile,
and second site always belongs to methanol. Arrows show directions of alternations due to an increase in pressure.

of RDF with density(pressure) is essentially the same.
The lack of ability for acetonitrile to serve as the proton
acceptor and donor has far reaching consequences and re-
sults in impossibility to create a hydrogen bond network
neither in pure substance or between water an acetoni-
trile molecules in their mixture. Thus, the solution of
acetonitrile in water represents situation when hydrogen

bonds are realized between both types of molecules, but
hydrogen bond network is possible to establish between
water molecules exclusively. Finally, for methanol in ace-
tonitrile the only hydrogen bond available in the system
is between the nitrogen site of the solvent and hydrogen
site of the solute, Fig. 4(b). Any type of the hydrogen
bond network does not appear in such solution at all.

B. Dynamical properties

Fig. 5 shows the density(pressure) dependence of the
normalized translational diﬀusion coeﬃcient D/D0 and
normalized reorientation relaxation time τ /τ0 for inves-
tigated solutes at various temperatures. Here D0 and
τ0 are translational diﬀusion coeﬃcient and reorienta-
tion relaxation time, respectively, of the solute at the
ambient density for the solvent, which is ρ = 0.997047
g/cm3 for water and ρ = 0.782 g/cm3 for acetonitrile. In
particular, Fig. 5(a) shows that for suﬃciently low tem-
perature the diﬀusion coeﬃcient of methanol in water
ﬁrst increases with density(pressure), and then smoothly
changes its behavior to the normal one, i.e. decreases
with density(pressure). Relatively ﬂat maximum is ob-
served for the density slightly smaller than that at the
ambient condition. At higher temperatures maximum is
not observed. Similar features can be mentioned about
behavior of the diﬀusion coeﬃcient of acetonitrile in wa-
ter, Fig.
5(b). But in this case the increase of the
diﬀusion coeﬃcient at the lowest temperature is very
small and can be monitored only by comparing num-
bers for neighboring density points. The cubic spline
curve, which connects these points, makes this very ﬂat
maximum observed visually. Behavior of the diﬀusion
coeﬃcient at higher temperatures does not deviate from
the normal one, as in the case of methanol in water. Ex-
perimental measurements of diﬀusion coeﬃcients for ace-
tonitrile in water and acetonitrile-D3 (CD3CN) in water,
both at T = 303 K, reported by Nakahara et al.
[2]
testify the same tendency in their density(pressure) be-
havior as obtained from the theory. Figure 5(c) demon-
strates monotonous decrease of the diﬀusion coeﬃcient of
methanol in acetonitrile in the entire range of densities
and at all investigated temperatures. Fig. 5(d) is a typ-
ical example of anomalous density(pressure) dependence
of the reorientation relaxation time. It is clear to see that
it ﬁrst decreases with density(pressure) and then starts
to behave normally, i.e. increases with density(pressure).
The order of decrease smoothly varies from about 40%
at T = 258.15 K to about 3% at T = 298.15 K. At
T = 373.15 K anomaly is not observed, but the increase is
very slow for the quite wide range of densities(pressures).
In the case of acetonitrile in water, Fig. 5(e), normal be-
havior of the reorientation relaxation time is observed
almost entirely except for the lowest temperature, where
τ has very shallow minimum. Finally, Fig. 5(f) demon-
strates monotonous increase of the reorientation relax-
ation time of methanol in acetonitrile in the entire range
of densities and at all investigated temperatures. In such
a way, it can be regarded as a typical example of nor-
mal density(pressure) behavior of τ . Filled triangles and
ﬁlled squares in Fig. 5 are results of MD simulation [9]
at T = 298 K for methanol in water and acetonitrile in
water, respectively, both at the inﬁnite dilution. And
asterisk symbols are experimental measurements [1] at
T = 298.2 K. One can see rather satisfactory correlation
between the results of our computation, MD simulations

and experiment, both qualitatively and quantitatively.
It should be noted, however, that in terms of absolute
values of D and τ agreement with simulation and exper-
imental data is poor.

Theoretical aspects of anomalous molecular mobility
have been considered previously by the example of neat
water [11]. Within the model employed, the authors pro-
posed that the enhancement of the molecular mobility
by compression can be related to the suppression of the
number-density ﬂuctuations in the low-k region (k is the
wave-number), rather than only the breakdown of the
tetrahedral hydrogen-bonding network structure of wa-
ter. The reasoning of this statement coherently follows
from the examination of the behavior of memory func-
tions [11] and is in harmony with the heuristic explana-
tion of the picture [38]. Let us imagine a molecule rotat-
ing in a polar media. The rotational motion will induce
a relaxation process of surrounding molecules in order
to make themselves aligned to the electric ﬁeld produced
by the new orientation of the molecule in concern. The
energy dissipation associated with the relaxation process
is an origin of the friction on the rotational motion, or
the dielectric friction. The larger is the charge density
ﬂuctuation, the greater is the dielectric friction. When
the liquid is compressed by an external pressure, the
mechanism of electrostatic friction on the dielectric re-
laxation is mostly the same except that molecules in the
solution are packed more tightly. Higher packing frac-
tion prevents large number density ﬂuctuations leading
to smaller non-uniformity in the the polarization density
and, as the result, smaller heterogeneity in the charge
density. Then the electrostatic friction on dielectric re-
laxation is smaller and means that the dielectric relax-
ation time becomes shorter. Such an acceleration en-
hances the mobility of molecules in solution through the
dielectric friction mechanism. Spherical shape of the
molecule, or equivalently – spherical shape for the re-
pulsive short-range interaction, favors anomalous molec-
ular mobility. It is because the dominant contribution to
the rotational and therefore dielectric friction is deﬁned
by the type of the interaction and its range, which ex-
plains the diﬀerence in the behavior of nearly spherical
shape molecule of methanol and rod-like shape molecule
of acetonitrile. For methanol the dominant contribution
comes from the long-range Coulomb interaction, while
for acetonitrile from the short-range repulsive one. As
the result, methanol in water exhibits more substantial
anomaly compared to acetonitrile in water. The anoma-
lous behavior is attributed to the strong electrostatic
interaction – the “hydrogen bond”, among the solvent
molecules and those between solute and solvent. The
former causes the decrease in the dielectric relaxation
time with pressure, while the latter induces the coupling
between the dielectric mode of the solvent and the rota-
tion of the solute. The anomaly is largely suppressed for
acetonitrile in water due to enhanced signiﬁcance of the
repulsive core in the molecule. Finally, methanol in ace-
tonitrile does not show any indication of the anomalous

density dependence because of strong collisional friction
on the collective reorientation of the solvent in this case,
so that the dielectric relaxation becomes slower with pres-
sure. Higher density or pressure just magniﬁes the eﬀect
of the repulsive core upon rotation and because of that –
the collisional friction.

V. SUMMARY

In present paper we have calculated the density de-
pendence of the translational diﬀusion coeﬃcients and
rank-1 reorientation relaxation times for acetonitrile and

methanol in water, and methanol in acetonitrile at var-
ious temperatures. Calculations have been performed
using the site-site memory equation with the mode-
coupling approximation for memory kernels, and the
DRISM/HNC for static properties. For simplicity of
theoretical and computational procedures solutions have
been considered in the limit of inﬁnite dilution. Calcu-
lated quantities have been obtained to behave anoma-
lously with density(pressure) for methanol in water. In
particular, translational diﬀusion coeﬃcient D may in-
crease for a while with density at low temperature (super-
cooled region), and reorientation relaxation time τ may
decrease with density to form a minimum in the vicin-

ity of ambient condition density for water in the quite
wide range of temperatures. Similar computations for
acetonitrile in water show tiny anomaly in the behavior
of D and τ only at the lowest (supercooled region) tem-
perature, while for other regions there is no deviation
from the usual behavior. And for methanol in acetoni-
trile there is no deviation in the entire region of inves-
tigated densities and temperatures. This picture is con-
sistent with results of experimental observation and MD
simulation, also quantitative agreement is not as good as

qualitative. The physical origin of the anomalous density
dependence of molecular mobility is interpreted in terms
of two competing origins of friction, which interplay with
each other as density increases: the collisional and dielec-
tric frictions which, respectively, strengthen and weaken
with increasing density. Presented results are ﬁrst in sci-
entiﬁc literature to realize anomalous molecular mobility
of polar solute in water by means of the statistical me-
chanical theory.

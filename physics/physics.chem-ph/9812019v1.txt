As part of a general study of the time-dependent local density approximation

(TDLDA), we here report calculations of optical activity of chiral molecules.

The theory automatically satisﬁes sum rules and the Kramers-Kronig rela-

tion between circular dichroism and optical rotatory power. We ﬁnd that

the theory describes the measured circular dichroism of the lowest states in

methyloxirane with an accuracy of about a factor of two. In the chiral fullerene

C76 the TDLDA provides a consistent description of the optical absorption

spectrum, the circular dichroism spectrum, and the optical rotatory power,

except for an overall shift of the theoretical spectrum.

I. INTRODUCTION

The time-dependent local density approximation (TDLDA) as well as the time-dependent

Hartree-Fock theory has been applied to the optical absorption of atomic and molecular

systems with considerable success [1-14]. Here we want to see how well the TDLDA method

does on a more subtle aspect of the optical response, the optical activity of chiral molecules.

Calculation of circular dichroism and especially optical rotatory power is more challenging

because the operators that must be evaluated are more sensitive to the approximations on

the wave function than the electric dipole in the usual form e~r. Nevertheless, we anticipate

that TDLDA may be a useful theory because the operators are still of the form of single-

electron operators. The TDLDA is derived by optimizing a wave function constructed from

(time-dependent) single-particle wave functions, so its domain of validity is the one-particle

observables.

In our implementation of TDLDA [8], we represent the electron wave function on a uni-

form spatial grid. The real-time evolution of the wave function is directly calculated and

the response functions are calculated by the time-frequency Fourier transformation. The

method respects sum rules and the Kramers-Kronig relation between the circular dichroism

and optical rotatory power. Since the grid representation is bias-free with respect to elec-

tromagnetic gauge, it is not subject to the gauge diﬃculties encountered when the space of

the wave function is constructed from an atomic orbital representation.

Optical activity has been a challenging problem for computational chemistry, but there

has been considerable progress in recent years. For example, Carnell et al. [15] present a good

description of the circular dichroism of excited states of R-methyloxirane using a standard

Gaussian representation of the wave function. The optical rotatory power is a much more

diﬃcult observable, since the whole spectrum contributes. Only very recently have ab initio

calculations been reported for this property [16,17].

After presenting our calculational method, we report our exploratory study on optical

activities of two chiral molecules: R-methyloxirane, a simple 10-atom molecule with known

2

chiroptical properties up to the ﬁrst few excited states [15,18,19], and C76, a fullerene with

very large optical rotatory power and signiﬁcant circular dichroism in the visible and UV

[20].

As is seen below, the optical rotatory power is proportional to the real part of β(E), and the

B. Real-time TDLDA

We ﬁrst rewrite the above strength functions as time integrations. We employ the

time dependent wave function Ψ(t) = exp[−iHt/¯h]Ψ(0) with the initial wave function at

t = 0 given by Ψ(0) = exp[ik

i zi]Φ0, where k is a small wave number.

In the linear

response, the time-dependent polarizability is proportional to the dipole matrix element,

z(t) = hΨ(t)|

i zi|Ψ(t)i. The frequency dependent polarizability in z direction is then

obtained as the time-frequency Fourier transformation of z(t),

R(E) of eq.(7) is the sum over three directions, R = Rx + Ry + Rz.

In the time-dependent local density approximation, the time-dependent wave function

Ψ(t) is approximated by a single Slater determinant. We prepare the initial single electron

orbitals as ψi(0) = exp[ikz]φi where φi is the static Kohn-Sham orbitals in the ground state.

The ψi(t) follows the time-dependent Kohn-Sham equation,

ment may be evaluated as z(t) =

ihψi|z|ψii and the similar expression for Lz(t). The

strength functions are then evaluated with eqs.(12) and (14).

C. Sum rules

According to the TRK sum rule, the integral of S(E) is equal to the number of active

electrons N. This sum rule is respected by the TDLDA. It also appears in the short time

behavior of z(t) as

It is known that R(n) for n ≤ 4 vanishes identically in the exact dynamics [22,24–26]. The

vanishing of R(0) in the time-dependent Hartree-Fock theory was ﬁrst noticed in [27]. The

short time behavior of L(t) = Lx(t) + Ly(t) + Lz(t) is related to R(n) as

Here we note that L(t) is an even function of t as seen in eq.(13). Since R(n) = 0 for n ≤ 4,

we see that L(t) behaves as t6 for small time. Li(t)(i = x, y, z) behave as t2 at small t and

the cancelation up to t4 order occurs after summing up three directions. In the TDLDA

dynamics, we conﬁrmed that at least t0 and t2 coeﬃcients of L(t), namely R(0) and R(2),

vanish identically.

D. Numerical detail

The TDLDA uses the same Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian as is used in ordinary static LDA

calculations. As is common in condensed matter theory, we use pseudopotentials that in-

clude the eﬀects of K-shell electrons rather than include these electrons explicitly. The

pseudopotentials are calculated by the prescriptions of ref. [28] and [29]. We employ the

simple exchange-correlation term proposed in ref. [30,31]. There are improved terms now in

use [33,32], but it was not deemed important for our application.

6

There are many numerical methods to solve the equations of TDLDA. Ours uses a

Cartesian coordinate space mesh to represent the electron wave functions, and the time

evolution is calculated directly [8,9,34]. There are only four important numerical parameters

in this approach: the mesh spacing, the number of mesh points, the time step in the time

integration algorithm, and the total length of time that is integrated. We have previously

found that the carbon molecules can be well treated using a mesh spacing of 0.3 ˚A [9,34].

We ﬁnd 0.25 ˚A is necessary for methyloxirane to represent accurately the orbitals around

oxygen. We take the spatial volume to be a sphere of radius 8 ˚A both for methyloxirane

and C76 presented below. The total number of mesh points, deﬁning the size of the vector

space, is about 4πR3/(3∆x3) ∼ 80, 000(140, 000) for mesh size of 0.3 ˚A(0.25 ˚A).

The algorithm for the time evolution is quite stable as long as the time step ∆t satisﬁes

∆t < ¯h/|H|, where |H| is the maximum eigenvalue of the Hamiltonian. This is mainly

dependent on the mesh size. For ∆x = 0.3 ˚A, we ﬁnd that ∆t = 0.002¯h/eV is adequate.

We integrate the equation of motion for a length of time T = 60¯h/eV for C76 (50¯h/eV for

methyloxirane). Then individual states can be resolved if their energy separation satisﬁes

∆E > 2π¯h/T ∼ 0.1eV.

Our numerical implementation, grid representation of the wave function and the time-

frequency Fourier transformation for the response calculation, has several advantages over

the usual approach using basis functions centered at the ions. They include:

(1) The full spectrum of wide energy region may be calculated at once and it respects sum

rules. The non-locality of the pseudopotential may cause violation of the sum rule, but the

eﬀect is small in the present systems.

(2)Since the circular dichroism R(E) and the optical rotatory power, real part of β(E), are

calculated as Fourier transformation of single function L(t), the Kramers-Kronig relation is

automatically satisﬁed.

(3)The gauge independence of the results is satisﬁed to high accuracy. Employing the

commutation relation [H,

~∇i, there is alternative expressions for optical

transitions with gradient operator instead of coordinate. For the rotational strength, for

The strength function with this expression may be calculable with initial wave function

ψi(0) = exp[id∇z]φi with small displacement parameter d. Since the grid representation of

wave function does not have any preference on the gauge condition, our method gives almost

identical results for the coordinate and gradient expressions of dipole matrix elements.

III. R-METHYLOXIRANE

The geometry of R-methyloxirane is shown in Fig. 1. We use the same nuclear distances

as in ref. [15]. We show in Fig. 2 the results of the static calculation for the orbital energies.

We ﬁnd a LUMO 6.0 eV above the HOMO, and a triplet of unoccupied states 0.5 eV higher.

In our calculation the lowest unoccupied orbitals have an diﬀuse, Rydberg-like character, s-

wave for the lower and p-wave for the upper, as in previous calculations [15,35]. The HOMO

is localized in the vicinity of the oxygen atom, and the measured absorption strength seen

at 7.1 and 7.7 eV is attributed to the excitation of a HOMO electron to the diﬀuse states. In

the TDLDA, the excitation energy comes out close to the orbital diﬀerence energies, except

for strongly collective states. Indeed we ﬁnd in the TDLDA calculation that the excitations

are within 0.1 eV of the HOMO-LUMO energy and the energy diﬀerence for the next state

above the LUMO. This is one eV less than the experimental values. It is known that the

LDA energy functional that we use is subject to overbind excitations close to the ionization

threshold. There are improved energy functions that rectify this problem [36], but for this

work we judged the error not important.

The next property we examine is related to the electric dipole matrix element, namely

the oscillator strength f associated with the transition. The optical absorption strength is

shown in Fig. 3. The total strength up to 100 eV excitation is f=22.4, which is 93% of the

sum rule for the 24 active electrons. Notice the lowest two peaks, centered at 6.0 and 6.5

8

eV. These are the states we are interested in. Their oscillator strengths are given in Table

I. We see that the states are both weak, less than a tenth of a unit. The eﬀect of the time-

dependent treatment is to lower the strengths by 30-50%. This is the well-known screening

eﬀect associated with virtual transitions of more deeply bound orbitals. We ﬁnd that the

computed transition strengths are within a factor of two of the measured ones. Typically,

the TDLDA does somewhat better than this, but most of the experience has been with

transitions carrying at least a tenth of a unit of oscillator strength. The original theoretical

calculation gave very poor transition strengths [18], oﬀ by more than an order of magnitude.

Unfortunately, the more recent study [15] did not include theoretical transition strengths.

We numerically conﬁrmed that our method gives almost identical results with coordinate

and gradient expressions of dipole matrix elements, as we noticed in the previous section.

However, exceptionally, the oscillator strength of the very weak features discussed above

suﬀer substantial dependence on the expression. With gradient formula for the transition

matrix elements, strengths of both ﬁrst and second transitions are larger by about factor

two than the coordinate expression. Since the gradient formula emphasizes high-momentum

components more heavily, we think the results with coordinate matrix elements may be more

reliable for low transitions, and we quote them in Table I.

We now turn to the chiroptical response. Fig. 4 shows the short-time behavior of Lx(t)

and the sum of the three Cartesian components L(t) =

i Li(t). An initial perturbation

of k = 0.001 ˚A−1 is employed. To within numerical precision, Lx(t) (solid line) grows with

P

time as t2, as discussed below eq.(18). The same is true for the other two components, Ly

and Lz. This shows that the numerical algorithm respects the ﬁrst sum rule. The combined

response, L(t) (dashed lines) shows an extreme cancelation at short times, as required by

the additional sum rules. However our numerical accuracy does not allow us to determine

the order of the power behavior. The evolution of L(t) for larger times is shown in Fig. 5.

Physically, the TDLDA breaks down at long times because of coupling to other degrees of

freedom. A typical width associates with such couplings is of the order of a tenth of an eV,

implying that the responses damp out on a time scale of T ≈ 10¯h/eV. We note that the

9

TDLDA algorithm itself is very stable, and allows us to integrate to much larger times and

obtain very sharp theoretical spectra.

We next show the Fourier transform of the chiroptical response. The circular dichro-

ism spectrum calculated with eq. (14) is shown in Fig. 6. Here we have integrated L to

T = 50¯h/eV, including a ﬁlter function in the integration to smooth the peaks. One can see

that the s- and the p-transitions are clearly resolved, although the three p-transitions are not

resolved from each other (as is the experimental case). The s-transition has a negative circu-

lar dichroism and the p-transition a positive one. Integrating over the peaks, the strengths

of the two peaks are -0.0014 and +0.0014 ˚A3-eV, respectively. The strengths are commonly

quoted in cgs units; the conversion factor is 1 eV-˚A3 = 1.609 ×10−36 erg-cm3. The values in

cgs units are given in Table I, compared to experiment and previous calculations. We ﬁnd

the signs are correctly given, but the values are somewhat too high, by a factor of 2 or 3.

The calculation of ref. [15] gave a result within the experimental range for the p-multiplet

but too small (by a factor of 2) for the s-transition. Thus we ﬁnd that the TDLDA has a

somewhat poorer accuracy in this case.

Next we consider the optical rotatory power. It could be calculated as the real part of the

Fourier transformation eq.(14). In practice, however, we found the calculation employing

Kramers-Kronig relation to the rotational strength function,

Reβ(E) =

gives more accurate result especially at the energy below the lowest transition. The mea-

surement is available at sodium D-line, 2.1 eV, [α]D = +14.65◦ [35] which gives β = +0.0017

˚A4. The calculated value at low energy is very sensitive to the number of states included in

the sum. Fig.6 shows the calculated value as a function of a cutoﬀ energy, upper bound in

the integration in eq.(20). The value taking only the contribution of the lowest transition

is -0.06. Including more states produces values that ﬂuctuate in sign and magnitude within

that range. Including all states below 100 eV gives a cancelation by a factor of 60 to yield

a value β = −0.001 ˚A4. This has the opposite sign but the same order of magnitude as the

10

measured β. Clearly, to get high relative accuracy with such a strong cancelation is more

demanding than our TDLDA can provide.

IV. C76

Remarkably, it is possible to separate the chiral partners of the double-helical fullerene

C76 using stereospeciﬁc chemistry [20]. The molecule shows a huge optical rotatory power,

[α]D = −4000◦, and a complex circular dichroism spectrum between 2 and 4 eV excitation

[20]. There has been reported only semi-empirical quantum chemistry calculation for the

optical activity of this molecule [37].

We ﬁrst remark on the geometry of the molecule, which has a chiral D2 symmetry [38].

The accepted geometry is depicted in ref. [20]; it may be understood as follows. We start

with C60, in which all carbons on pentagons. Group the pentagons into triangles and divide

the fullerene in half keeping two adjacent triangles of pentagons intact in each half. The

“peel” of six pentagons already has a chiral geometry dependent on the relative orientation

of its two triangles of pentagons. The C76 is constructed by adding 16 carbon atoms between

the split halves of the C60. The added carbon atoms lie entirely on hexagons which form

a complete band around the fullerene. The inserted band has the geometry of an (8,2)

chiral buckytube. The result is then the chiral C76. Our calculations are performed on a

right-handed C76, in the sense that the band of hexagons corresponds to a right-handed

buckytube. This is the same convention as used in ref. [38], their Fig. 3d.

The C76 has 152 occupied spatial orbitals. We show the orbitals near the Fermi level in

Fig. 8. The HOMO-LUMO gap is only 0.9 eV, and there are many transition in the optical

region. In Fig. 9 we show the optical absorption strength function for the range 0-50 eV.

Smoothing is made with the width of 0.2 eV in the Fourier transformation. A concentration

of strength is apparent at 6 eV excitation; there is a similar peak in graphite and C60 which is

associated with π − π∗ transitions. The strong, broad peak centered near 20 eV is associated

with σ − σ∗ transitions and is also present in C60 [34]. The feature at 13 eV is not present in

11

C60 , however. In the next ﬁgure, Fig. 10, we show a magniﬁed view of the absorption at low

energy. We also compare the TDLDA strength with the single-electron strength, smoothed

also by convolution with a Breit-Wigner function of width Γ = 0.2 eV. The TDLDA has a

strong inﬂuence on the strength distribution, decreasing the total strength in the low energy

region and concentrating in the 6 eV peak. The experimental absorption strength [38] (with

arbitrary normalization) is shown as the dashed line. It agrees with the TDLDA quite well.

We next examine the circular dichroism spectrum. Fig. 11 shows the rotatory strength

function between 0 and 50 eV. Like the case of methyloxirane, it is irregular without any large

scale structures. Its integral is zero to an accuracy of 0.001 eV-˚A3. The low energy region is

shown in Fig. 12. Here one sees qualitative similarities between theory and experiment [20].

The theoretical sharp negative peak at 1.8 eV corresponds to an experimental peak at 2.2

eV. Shifting the higher spectra by that amount (0.6 eV), one sees a correspondence between

the next positive and negative excursions. We note that a similar shift in the excitation

energy was also seen in the optical absorption of C60 between the measurement and the

TDLDA calculation [34].

Our theoretical optical rotatory power is plotted in Fig. 13. The situation here is dif-

ferent from the methyloxirane, in that rotatory power is large in a region where there are

allowed transitions. The measured optical rotatory power, [α]D = −4000◦ at 2.1 eV [20]

corresponding to β = −7.3 ˚A4, is shown as the star. It does not agree with theory, but we

should remember that the spectrum needs to be shifted by 0.6 eV to reproduce the circular

dichroism. Adjusting the theoretical spectrum upward by that amount, we ﬁnd that it is

consistent in sign and order of magnitude with the measurement. Since the optical rotatory

power in the region of allowed transitions changes rapidly as excitation energy, a measure-

ment of the energy dependence would be very desirable, and would allow a more rigorous

comparison with the theory.

V. CONCLUDING REMARKS

We have presented an application of the time-dependent local density approximation

to the optical activities of chiral molecules. Our method is based on the uniform grid

representation of the wave function, real-time solution of the time-dependent Kohn-Sham

equation, and the time-frequency Fourier transformation to obtain the response functions. In

this way we can calculate the optical absorption, circular dichroism, and the optical rotatory

power over a wide energy region, respecting sum rules and Kramers-Kronig relation.

We applied our method to two molecules, methyloxirane and C76. For lowest two tran-

sitions of methyloxirane, the TDLDA reproduces the absorption and rotational strength in

the accuracy within factor two. The qualitative feature of the circular dichroism spectrum of

C76 is also reproduced rather well. However, the optical rotatory power is found to be a very

sensitive function with strong cancelation. Even though we obtained rotational strength of

full spectral region, it is still diﬃcult to make quantitative prediction of optical rotatory

power at low energies in our present approach.

Abstract

We give a framework for molecular multiphoton excitation process induced by

an optimally designed electric ﬁeld. The molecule is initially prepared in a coherent su-

perposition state of two of its eigenfunctions. The relative phase of the two superposed

eigenfunctions has been shown to control the optimally designed electric ﬁeld which trig-

gers the multiphoton excitation in the molecule. This brings forth ﬂexibility in designing

the optimal ﬁeld in the laboratory by suitably tuning the molecular phase and hence by

choosing the most favorable interfering routes that the system follows to reach the target.

We follow the quantum ﬂuid dynamical formulation for designing the electric ﬁeld with

application to HBr molecule.

I. INTRODUCTION

Finding ways to control the quantum phenomena is, arguably, the essence

of chemical and physical processes. Advancement in generating tailored light pulses has

made it possible to steer matter towards a speciﬁc goal, namely, to control its future [1–7].

It is now well established that light shaping is an eﬃcient way of controlling quantum

systems and thus, for example, chemical reactions. Recent days have suggested a variety of

control schemes and their implementations in the laboratory [8–14] based on the coherent

nature of the laser radiation.

Coherent control (CC) scheme accesses the broad range of quantum interference

eﬀect through the relative phase of the light waves and/or the relative phase of the

molecular eigenfunctions as has been theoretically demonstrated by Brumer and Shapiro

[5,6] and experimentally realized by others [14]. A somewhat diﬀerent control scheme

uses the rapid progress in ultrashort laser pulse technology, e.g.

, Tannor et al [2,15]

suggested a “pump-dump” technique, which has been realized experimentally by several

2

groups [16,17]. These techniques deliver control through a limited number of parameters,

viz., the optical phase, the molecular phase and the time delay between pump and dump

laser pulses.

In the general ﬁeld of controlling dynamics these parameters are not suﬃcient and

it was Rabitz et. al [18] who ﬁrst proposed in their optimal control theory (OCT) that the

electric ﬁeld of the laser pulse should be treated as parameter and be speciﬁcally designed

both temporally and spectrally. Theoretically, OCT creates a nonstationary state of one’s

choice, by optimally designing the control ﬁeld. The control ﬁeld couples the system with

itself in a way that as the system evolves, its motion is modiﬁed by the inﬂuence of the

ﬁeld along its path, and the optimal control ﬁeld provides the maximum overlap of the

time-evolved state with the state of one’s choice. Although there have been progress in

the pulse-shaping technology, it still remains a huge task ahead to design such ﬁeld in the

laboratory.

In this paper, we present a theoretical treatment of the OCT which introduces the

parameter, molecular phase, mostly used in the CC scheme. This prepares the molecule

in a coherent superposition state comprising of two molecular eigenfunctions, prior to its

being submitted to the control ﬁeld. The molecular phase is shown to be an experimental

parameter which can take a whole range of values for designing the control ﬁeld. We orga-

nize this paper as follows : section 2 describes the preparation of the initial superposition

state comprising of two vibrational eigenfunctions of the ground electronic state of HBr

molecule. This can be accomplished by non-resonant two-photon interaction between the

molecule in the ground state and two laser electric ﬁelds. The relative phase of the laser

ﬁelds deﬁnes the molecular phase of the eigenfunctions forming the superposition. Section

3 brieﬂy presents OCT within the framework of quantum ﬂuid dynamics (QFD), called

OCT-QFD method, for desiging an electric ﬁeld to meet a speciﬁc objective. The details

of the OCT-QFD have been published before [19,20]. Section 4 applies the OCT-QFD

for the manipulation of the multiphoton excitation of HBr molecule subject to the design

of an optimal control ﬁeld. Section 5 concludes the paper.

II. MOLECULAR COHERENCE AND SUPERPOSITION STATE

Here we showed one possible way to prepare the superposition state of HBr. The approach

is based on a nonresonant two-photon transition phenomena whereby the molecule intially

in the eigenstate |ν1J1M1 > transfers population to the eigenstate |ν2J2M2 > through the

intermediate states. Here |νJM > refers to the ro-vibrational eigenfunction correspond-

ing to an electronic state, where ν is the vibrational quantum number, J the rotational

quantum number and M the projection of J onto the internuclear axis in the laboratory

coordinate. Let us consider the superposition where both |ν1J1M1 > and |ν2J2M2 >

belong to the same electronic state, viz., the ground state 1Σ+ of HBr molecule. The

two-photon excitation is assumed take place by the laser ﬁeld given by

E(t) = ˆηE(0)f (t)cosωLt(1 + cosφL)

where

f (t) = e−

( t−t0

(2)

with t0 being the switch-on time of the pulse, τ being related to the full width at half

maximum(FWFM) as F W HM = 2τ
and E(0)

q

the maximum amplitude of the laser electric ﬁeld. The electric ﬁeld polarization

−ln(1/2), ωL the central frequency of the pulse

vector ˆη is considered along z direction in the laboratory coordinate. This ﬁeld can be

obtained by the superposition of two identical laser pulses with relative phase φL. The

superposition state is thus given by

Ψs(t) = c1(t)|ν1J1M1 > e−

iω1t + c2(t)|ν2J2M2 > e−

iω2t

(3)

At t = −∞ |c1|2 = 1 and at time t |c1(t)|2 = 1 − |c2(t)|2. In the above equation ωi = Ei

where Ei is the energy of the |νiJiMi > eigenstate. For two-photon interaction, applying

the second order time-dependent perturbation theory we obtain

J2 = J1 (or J2 = J1 + 2). The vibrational quantum numbers for the superposition can be

either ν2 = ν1 or ν2 6= ν1. Note that the assumption of the perturbation theory implies

that |c2(t)|2 cannot exceed ≡ 0.2 which, in other words, restricts the power of the pump

laser [23]. Notice that the molecular phase deﬁned as φM = tan−

(c2)
(c2), where ℜ and ℑ
refer to the real and the imaginary parts respectively, depends mainly on φL, ω1 and ω2.

1( ℑ

The factor (ΓI + Γ2)/2 or (ΓI + Γ1)/2 in the exponent of equations 4 and 5 respectively,

have the least contribution to the molecular phase since they are neglible compared to

ω2I = ω2 − ωI or ωI1 = ωI − ω1 respectively. Thus one can vary φM in the laboratory by

varying φL, ω1 and ω2.

III. OCT-QFD METHOD

In optimal control theory an objective functional, corresponding to a speciﬁc dynamics of

one’s choice, is minimized with respect to the electric ﬁeld by solving the time-dependent

Schroedinger (TDSE) equation. Consider a general target expectation value deﬁned as

ΘT =

Θρ(x, T )dx

T

Z
o

(9)

where Θ is an observable operator and ρ(x, T ) = Ψ∗(x, T )Ψ(x, T ) with Ψ(x, t) being the

complex wave function at the target time t=T. This wave function Ψ(x, t) obeys the

TDSE

moment.

(10)

where V typically conﬁnes the particle in a locale and Vext is the control taken here as

−µ(x)Ec(t) with Ec(t) being the control electric ﬁeld to be designed and µ(x) the dipole

The goal is to steer ΘT as close as possible to a desired value Θd. The active spatial

control interval is taken as xl < x < xr over the time 0 < t < T that the control process

occurs. We now desire to minimize the cost functional Jcost = Jtarget + Jf ield, where Jtarget

Jtarget =

The minimization of Jcost with respect to Ec(t) must be subjected to the satisfaction of the

equations of motion for Ψ(x, t) in Eq.(10), which can be transformed into two equations,

viz., the continuity equation

2ρ1/2
ρ1/2 =

Deﬁning the quantum current as

j(x, t) = −

one readily obtains the equation of motion for j as

j = −v(∇ · j) − (j · ∇)v −

(16)

Thus within the QFD formulation, we need to minimize Jcost with respect to Ec(t) subject

to the satisfaction of the equations of motion for ρ and j given by Eqs.(13) and (16)

respectively.

We may fulﬁll this constraint by introducing the unconstrained cost functional as

An optimal solution satisﬁes δ ¯J = 0, which is assured by setting each of the functional

(25)

The equations (18) and (19) for λ2 and λ1 respectively ressemble that of ρ and j with the

only diﬀerence being the extra source terms S1 and S2. The source terms depend on ρ

and j. vλ in the above equations is the ’velocity’ associated with the Lagrange’s multiplier
and is given as vλ = λ1

λ2 . There are now two diﬀerent quantum potential terms, one of
which is a function of ρ(x, t) and the other is a function of λ2(x, t). In this formalism

the evolution of λ1(x, t) takes place by Vq(λ2) as well as the diﬀerence of the two types

of quantum potential. In obtaining the above equations we have standardly assumed no

variation of either ρ(x, 0) or j(x,0). Thus, we start from the initial value of ρ(x, 0) and

j(x,0) to solve Eqs.(13) and (16). Eqs.(18) and (19) can be solved for λ2(x, t) and λ1(x, t)

by integrating backward from time T using λ1(x, T ) and λ2(x, T ) given in Eqs.(24) and

(25) respectively. The equations (13), (16), (18) and (19) are non-linear thereby calling

for iteration to solve(see ref. [24] and [25] for details). Finally the desired control electric

ﬁeld is given from Eq.(20) as

4 APPLICATION TO HBR MOLECULE

The OCT-QFD has been applied for manipulating the multiphoton excitation process of

HBr molecule whose initial density ρ(x, 0) is given by

ρ(x, 0) = |c1|2ρ1(x, 0) + |c2|2ρ2(x, 0) + 4|c1||c2|cosφM ρ12(x, 0)

(27)

where c1 and c2 have been obtained following section 2. In Eq.(27) ρi(x, 0) = |ψi(x, 0)|2

and the ρ12(x, 0) = ψ1(x, 0)ψ2(x, 0) where ψi(x, 0) corresponds to the |νiJjMi > eigenstate

with x being the internuclear distant. Although the perturbation theory permits |c2|2 ≤

9

0.2 there could be other non-perturbative methods resulting |c2|2 > 0.2. Thus, in the

results below whenever we consider |c2|2 > 0.2 we assume the existence of some non-

perturbative methods. A whole range of φM can be attempted to follow the diﬀerent

interfering routes to reach to the target state by suitably modifying the control ﬁeld

Ec(t).

Equation (4) for c2 shows that we need the ro-vibrational eigenfunctions in the ground and

the excited electronic states. These have been evaluated by solving the time independent

Schr¨odinger equation using the Fourier Grid Hamiltonian(FGH) method [26]. The ground

and the excited electronic potentail energies have been taken from the ref. [27]. Figure

1 shows c2 for the superposition c1|000 > e−

iE1t/¯h + c2|100 > e−

iE2t/¯h where E1 and E2

are the energies of the eigenstates |000 > and |100 > respectively. This gives |c2|2 = 0.2,

|c1|2 = 0.8 and φM = 0.25 radian after the laser ﬁelds disappear. For any superposition

one can choose a whole range of values for φM for a given |c1|2 and |c2|2 by choosing

diﬀerent values of φL. This φM , ω1, ω2, |c1| and |c2| have been used as parameters for

designing the control ﬁeld for the occurrence of a speciﬁc dynamical change in the molecule

corresponding to the target operator Θ = x, where x represents the average distant along

the internclear axis. Other kinds of target operator can also be considered in the present

QFD-OCT following some modiﬁcations of the control equations (see ref. [20]). In the

results shown below the spatial range of the calculation was 0 ≤ x(a.u.) ≤ 14 and the

time interval was 0 ≤ t ≤ T with T=5000 a.u. The total number of the spatial mesh

points taken was 52 which gives δx = 0.27 a.u. whereas the total number of time steps

was 2000 which gives δt = 2.5 a.u. The weight ωe is taken 0.5 and ωx 500 and the desired

target value Θd = 3.2 a.u.

Figures 2,3,4 and 5 show the results for the optimal control ﬁeld and the dynamics in-

volved. Notice that the desired target, i.e., Θd = 3.2 a.u.

is the same for alll the cases

(Figs. 3, 4(b) and 5((b),(d))) although the paths through which the dynamics occur to

reach the desired target were diﬀerent. Basically, the phenomena that causes the ex-

pectation value of x to change in time is the multi-photon excitation of the molecule

induced by the control ﬁeld along a selective path. If we assume that the control ﬁeld

10

strengths are low enough for the perturbation theory to be valid, which is indeed true

in the present results(e.g., Emax ≈ 0.3 a.u.(Fig.2(c)) corresponding to maximum inten-

sity ≈ 1014W att/cm2 and Emin ≈ 0.06 a.u.(Fig.5(c)) corresponding to ≈ 1013W att/cm2

intensity) we ﬁnd that the time evolved wave function under the control ﬁeld is

(28)

(29)

Ψ(t) = Ψs(t) +

cj(t)ψje−

iωj t

Xj

where the summation j occurs over all the possible states excited by the optimal ﬁeld

starting from the superposition state. In the above equation cj(t) depends on c1 and c2

as cj(t) = c1f1(t) + c2f2(t), e.g., in the ﬁrst order perturbation theory fi, is given as

fi = −

t

1
¯h

dji Z

0

ei(ωji−

i(Γj +Γi)/2)t′

E(t′)dt′

where E(t) is the optimal control ﬁeld. Thus, the density at any time after the control

ﬁeld is on is given by ρ(x, t) = ρni(x, t) + ρin(x, t) where “in” referes to the interference

term and “ni” to the non-interference term. Similarly the target expectation has both

non-interference and interference terms in it, i.e., < x > (t) =< x >ni (t)+ < x >in (t).

This readily gives the optimal control ﬁeld E(t) = Eni(t) + Ein(t) The non-interference

terms associated with ρni(x, t), < x >ni (t) or Eni(t) have two parts, one relates to |c1|2

and the other to |c2|2 whereas the interference terms depend on |c1|, |c2| and φM .

Thus, one actually controls the dynamics of the multiphoton excitation process subject to

the suitable designing of an optimal electric ﬁeld which itself can be controlled by varying

the parameters, viz., φM , |c1|, |c2|, ω1 and ω2. This has been depicted through the ﬁgures

2 to 5. The dynamics by the control ﬁeld, take place through three routes : (a) route that

ends up at ψj (Eq.(28)) from |ν1J1M1 >, the probability of which is proportional to |c1|2,

(b) route that ends up at ψj from |ν2J2M2 >, the probability of which is proportional to

|c2|2 and (c) the route that end up at ψj through the interference between the routes (a)

and (b), the probability of which is proportional to |c1||c2|sinφM or |c1||c2|cosφM . Thus

the molecular phase can cause certain excitations by the control ﬁeld during the process

of its designing, which are not present in the absence of the superposition state.

Figure 2 shows the control ﬁelds corresponding to four diﬀerent values of φM for the

superposition |000 > +|100 >. These ﬁelds excite several vibrational excited states(not

11

shown here) in the process of achieving the target state, i.e., a state with Θd = 3.0 a.u.

The peak value of the strongest ﬁeld (Fig.2c) is ≈ 0.2 a.u. (corresponding intensity is

≈ 1014W att/cm2) which can be readily attained in the laboratory. However, the pulse

shape presents a chalange to the present-day laser shaping technology. A detailed char-

acterization of the optimal ﬁeld can however, be made by Fourier transforming the ﬁelds.

Fig. 3 shows the average distance < x > as a function of time, the corresponding control

ﬁelds are shown in Fig.2. Notice that the molecular phase, φM changes the course of

the dynamics of excitation as evidenced by the behaviour of the the expectation value of

< x > and the corresponding optimal control ﬁelds.

Figure 4 shows the optimal electric ﬁeld and the corresponding expectation value of x for

the superposition |000 > +|200 >. This result can be compared to that of Figs. 2a and

3a for the superposition |000 > +|100 >. Figure 5 on the otherhand, shows < x > (t)

and the corresponding optimal ﬁeld for diﬀerent values of |c2|2 for the superposition

|000 > +|100 >.

IV. CONCLUSION

This paper presents the optimal design of the electric ﬁeld by using the QFD formulation.

Molecular coherence has been introduced in such design of the electric ﬁeld, by creating

a nonstationary superposition state comprising of two vibrational eigenfunctions of HBr

molecule in its ground electronic conﬁguration, prior to its submission to the electric

ﬁeld to be designed. The molecular coherence is created by allowing the molecule to

interact with a superposed laser ﬁeld. We showed that the molecular phase φM can be

experimentally varied and used as a parameter to modify the optimal electric ﬁeld so as

to manipulate certain dynamical change in the molecule. Applications to the multiphoton

excitation of HBr molecule, described by the expectation value of x, show that control

range is extensive. The results show that pulses with diﬀerent structures result in diﬀerent

excitation processes since they follow diﬀerent interfering routes, and the interference

routes are controlled by the molecular phase. One can indeed optimize other quantity

12

with some constraints in it so as to follow only one out of several interference routes.

The extent to which molecular coherence (and hence, the quantum interference) enters

into the optimal results of the elctric ﬁeld is central to the understanding of the control of

the excitation. At present we found a variety of results. In several cases such interference

was indispensable in producing the optimal results, often necessitaing the involvement

of large numbers of interferring routes to the excited states. Although the multiphoton

excitation phenomena are not so suitably described by the operator x, this is the ﬁrst

case study where we combined the coherent control method with the optimal control

method. Other multiphoton excitation processes, with suitable operators, are currently

under investigation.

Note that one could use the standard control equations based on the TDSE, however, re-

cent studies [20,24,?,?] show that the QFD equations require lesser number of spatial grid

points than the TDSE when solved numerically which apparently enhances the eﬃciency

and the numerical saving of the QFD-OCT. This enhancement is attributed mainly to

the relatively slow varying nature of the hydrodynamical variables, compared to the wave

function, in the spatial coordinate. It may be mentioned that for other target operators

the TDSE based control equations may be easier to handel than the QFD based equations

however, in the present study the chosen operator is such that QFD based equations are

more easy to solve.

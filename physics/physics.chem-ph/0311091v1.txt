A methodology is developed for building semiempirical exchange-correlation functionals for large
molecules. The method uses molecular similarity by assuming that data collected for a molecular
subsystem in various environments, such as for an aldehyde functional group in diﬀerent molecules
and electrostatic ﬁelds, contains the information needed to describe it in other similar environments.
The method uses a data set of highly accurate calculations on a molecular subsystem to map
the subsystem two-electron density onto its one-electron density. The two-electron density, and
therefore the exchange-correlation functional, of a large molecule is approximated from the predicted
two-electron densities of overlapping molecular subsystems. The method is demonstrated on two
simple model systems: full inclusion of correlation on minimal-basis hydrogen chains and MP2 on
substituted aldehydes.

Canonical ab initio electronic structure methods provide highly accurate electronic structures for small systems of
O(10) atoms. However, the computational eﬀort of these methods scales poorly with system size, requiring up to
exponential scaling for the exact, fully-correlated solution in a given basis set. There has been much progress over
the last several years in developing ab initio methods that can accurately treat electron correlation with reduced
computational eﬀort [1, 2, 3]. While these methods are useful, their computational expense still precludes their
application to large systems such as proteins.

Semiempirical electronic structure theories [4, 5] provide a route to modeling systems that are too large for ab
initio treatment. Here we develop accurate semiempirical methods for treating electron correlation. These methods
construct the electronic structures of large systems by (i) extracting information from rich data sets of ab initio
calculations on small systems, and (ii) combining this information using the assumptions of nearsightedness and
molecular similarity.

Nearsightedness, as put forth in Ref. [6], is the principle that a many-electron system’s local electronic structure
about a point r is largely determined by the eﬀective potential for points r′ near r. Molecular similarity is simply the
idea that molecular subsystems (-CH3, -OH, etc.) behave roughly the same way in diﬀerent molecules. The assumption
of nearsightedness can be implemented in any theory (semiempirical or ab initio) that represents electronic structure in
terms of local information, such as electron densities [7, 8, 9] or correlations between localized orbitals [3, 10, 11]. The
assumption of molecular similarity is at the heart of chemistry, and underlies the atom- or functional-group-speciﬁc
parameters of semiempirical theories.

We implement a nearsighted treatment of electron correlation by representing electronic structure in terms of one-
and two-electron densities. A system’s one- and two-electron density matrices 1D, 2D are obtained from its normalized
N -electron wavefunction |Φi as

in second quantization with one-electron basis functions {|ai}. The electron density in real space is the diagonal of
the one-electron density matrix: 1D(r) ≡ hΦ| a†
rar |Φi [12]. 1D and 2D provide a complete description of a system
whose Hamiltonian contains only one- and two-body interactions [13].

The two-electron density 2D obtained from |Φi can be expressed as a cumulant expansion [14, 15]

where the three terms on the right-hand side of Eq. 3 are denoted Coulomb, exchange, and correlation contributions
to 2D and the connected pair density 2∆ cannot be written as a simple function of 1D.

The Coulomb and exchange contributions to 2D in Eq. 3 are well-approximated at the Hartree and Hartree-Fock
levels of theory, respectively. However, accurate ab initio treatment of the connected pair density 2∆ requires expensive
high-level methods. Nearsightedness suggests that a large system’s 2∆ can be assembled, as described in Ref. [6] and
schematized in Fig. 1, by (i) partitioning the system into O(N ) overlapping subsystems, (ii) independently evaluating
each subsystem 2∆, and (iii) assembling the subsystem results into a 2∆ for the entire system. The resulting system
2∆(r, r′) is accurate for length scales |r − r′| up to the order of subsystem size. This non-variational method for
assembling 2∆ is similar in spirit to localized coupled-cluster [3, 16, 17, 18] and divide-and-conquer theories [7, 8, 9].
Our “localized reduced density matrix” (LRDM) approach [19] assembles 2∆ from ab initio subsystem calculations
in an atomic orbital basis set [20].

The LRDM method schematized in Fig. 1 provides a route to implementing semiempirical, molecular-similarity
based approximations for 2∆. We use highly accurate ab initio calculations to construct databases of a molecular
subsystem’s 2∆ in diﬀerent environments. The information in these databases can be “mined” to parametrize func-
tionals that return the subsystem’s 2∆ as a function of simple characteristics of the subsystem and its environment
(e.g. subsystem geometry, subsystem 1D, environment multipole moments). The predicted 2∆ for all of a molecule’s
subsystems are combined as in LRDM to give a semiempirical approximation for 2∆ of the entire system.

In the current work, we parametrize functionals that predict subsystem 2∆ or 2DXC as a function of subsystem
one-electron density 1D. (We will use 2D[1D] as a generic term for functionals that return a molecular subsystem’s
2∆ or 2DXC as a functional of its 1D.) The functionals are used as correlation or exchange-correlation functionals in
density functional theory, as described below. The proposed method may also be useful for density matrix functional
theory [21].

Density functional theory (DFT) is a formally exact method for treating a system of N interacting electrons in
terms of the one-electron density of a system of noninteracting electrons [13, 22, 23]. The electron-electron interaction

3

energy is treated as the sum of a mean-ﬁeld Coulomb term and an exchange-correlation correction EXC , such that
the electrons move in a one-electron potential corrected by vXC (r) = δ(EXC )/δ(1D(r)). DFT is implemented by
approximating vXC as a functional of electron density: vXC = vXC [1D]. The exchange-correlation energy EXC may

2DX + 2∆
be obtained as the trace over the exchange-correlation two-electron density: EXC =
ac. Thus,
(cid:1)
P
a system’s exchange-correlation functional vXC [1D] or its correlation component vcorr[1D] can be obtained from the
ﬁrst derivative of the system’s 2DXC [1D] or 2∆[1D] functional, respectively (see Eq. 5).

We ﬁt subsystem 2∆[1D] and 2DXC[1D] functionals to a truncated Taylor expansion and use principle component
analysis of the training set densities in the atomic orbital basis. For example, matrix elements of a functional of the
connected pair density 2∆[1D] are ﬁt as

The system vcorr[1D] functional is obtained by overlaying subsystem contributions as in LRDM (Fig. 1). These are
the lowest-order approximation for 2D[1D] functionals, and we expect that more sophisticated functional forms can
give more accurate results.

Our DFT correlation functionals diﬀer considerably from the standard DFT functionals LDA [23, 25] and GGA [26],
that model vXC [1D] as that of a homogeneous electron gas. Other authors have developed both semiempirical [27, 28]
and subsystem-based [29, 30] vXC [1D] functionals, but to our knowledge the current method is unique in combining
the assumption of molecular similarity with a nearsighted approximation for the two-electron density.

The remainder of this paper details demonstrations of the method. We use GAMESS for all ab initio calcula-
tions [31]. We begin by demonstrating 2D[1D] functionals with a dimerized chain of ten minimal-basis hydrogen atoms
(H-H)5. This system is small enough that the functionals can be compared to exact (FCI) solutions. RHF+FCI/STO-
3G calculations were performed on 300 systems. Each system had a random geometry, and was placed in a random
ﬁeld of point charges [32]. The exact 1D and 2D were partitioned into four overlapping (H-H)2 subsystems as in
Fig. 1. One-third of the systems were chosen at random to be the training set, with the remainder being the testing
set [33]. The training set data were used to train a 2∆[1D] and a 2DXC [1D] functional for (H-H)2, using Eq. (4) [34].
Figure 2 and Table I show predicted energies for (H-H)5 systems, obtained by using the above functionals to predict
2D of the (H-H)2 subsystems and combining the predictions as in LRDM. Table I also includes results from the
1D
individual (H-H)2 subsystem functionals.
of the exact solution. Results quoted as using 1DDF T use the 1D obtained from using the 2∆[1D] functionals
as the correlation-energy functional (Eq. 5) in DFT with exact exchange. Both 1DEXACT and 1DDF T exhibit
high correlation between exact and predicted Ecorr, but there is a small systematic error in the DFT results. The
semiempirical functionals sometimes return Ecorr (and total energy) below the exact energy, as anticipated for a
nonvariational method.

In Fig. 2 and Table I, results quoted as using 1DEXACT use the

As a point of comparison, Fig. 2 and Table I also show correlation energies obtained with a standard approximate
method, RHF+MP2. The mean absolute Ecorr error from RHF+MP2 is greater than 200 mH, compared to the
less than 10 mH error from our 2D[1D] functionals. RHF+MP2 also underestimates the variation in the correlation
energy across this data set, obtaining a line of slope 0.19 in the plot of predicted versus exact correlation energies, as
compared to the slope near one obtained from our 2D[1D] functionals.

The results obtained here are encouraging. A single 2D[1D] functional, ﬁtted to reproduce 2D components, suﬃced
to describe both energies and energy derivatives for all four of the (H-H)2 subsystems, in a wide range of molecular
geometries and electrostatic environments.

To aid transferability between basis sets, subsystem 2D[1D] functionals can be deﬁned from the electron density
1D(r) = hΦ| a†
rar |Φi evaluated on a Cartesian-space grid. For proof-of-principle purposes, we used the data in Fig. 2
to construct real-space 2∆[1D] for a small number of points (36 2∆(r1, r2) ﬁt to quadratic functions of 17 1D(r)) in

4

an (H-H)2 subsystem. Again, data from one-third of the (H-H)5 systems was used to train the functional. R2 values
between real and predicted 2∆(r1, r2) for (H-H)5 were 0.99 for the training set and 0.97 for the testing set.

We next consider correlation and exchange-correlation functionals for a more realistic subsystem, the aldehyde
(HOC) subsystem of HOC-CH2-X molecules [35]. Since exact solutions for this system are not computationally
feasible, 2D[1D] functionals were ﬁtted to RHF+MP2/6-31G calculations [35]. We generated two data sets of
HOC-CH2-X in random distributions of point charges, denoted “simple” and “augmented” and with subsituents
X=H and X={H,O−} [36]. 2D[1D] functionals were ﬁtted to both simple and augmented data sets, using half the
data as training set [37]. The functionals were tested on their respective (simple or augmented) data sets. Functionals
were tested for their ability to reproduce the subsystem correlation or exchange-correlation energy, deﬁned as e.g.
Ecorr =

hac|bdi 2∆bd

ac ; {abcd} ∈ HOC.

We also generated an “extrapolated” test data set consisting of HOC-CH2-X molecules without electrostatic per-
2 , -NH+
turbations and with X = -CH3, -CFH2, -CF3, -CN, -CCH, -CHO, -COCl, -NO2, -OH, -OCH3, -O−, -CO−
3 ,
-F, -Cl, -Li, -Na. The degree of extrapolation can be quantiﬁed by calculating the average fraction of 1D that lies
along the principle components included in the semiempirical functionals of Eq. (4). The average fraction is always
greater than 0.97 for training and testing data sets. It is signiﬁcantly lower for the extrapolated data, 0.80 (0.87) for
the functionals parametrized from the simple (augmented) training set.

The results in Table II show that the aldehyde 2D[1D] functionals provide a good description of both training and
testing data. The quality of the extrapolation varies among the diﬀerent molecules. Table II includes extrapolation
results for four representative HOC-CH2-X, showing that (a) the eﬀects of some X groups (CN) are well-described
by all of the 2D[1D] functionals, (b) some X groups (O−, NH+
3 ) are described better by the augmented functionals,
and (c) a few X groups (OH) are described equally poorly by all of the functionals, indicating that they require more
sophisticated 2D[1D] functionals and/or a diﬀerent training set.

We tested 2∆[1D] and 2DXC[1D] functionals for the aldehyde group in molecules without a “buﬀer” between the
aldehyde and the perturbing substituent, HOC-X. Functionals were ﬁtted as above to data on point-charge-perturbed
HOC-H. The functionals gave reasonable predictions for the point-charge-perturbed HOC-H data (average Ecorr and
EXC errors of 8.8 and 87 mH, respectively, for the testing set) but signiﬁcantly worse extrapolation results. This is
likely due to the spatial proximity of ﬁtted (HOC) and perturbing (X) subsystems.

This paper explores an approach for constructing semiempirical theories that include accurate electron-electron
correlations. Comparison with exact results for a small model system and approximate (MP2) results for a more
realistic system suggests the feasibility of the approach. The results are especially encouraging given the simple,
low-order data ﬁtting methods employed. The present approach has the potential to complement ab initio treatments
of correlation, particularly for accurate calculations on large, modular systems such as proteins.

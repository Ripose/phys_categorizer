Abstract

An algebraic model in terms of a local harmonic boson realization was recently

proposed to study molecular vibrational spectra [Zhong-Qi Ma et al., Phys.

Rev. A 53, 2173 (1996)]. Because of the local nature of the bosons the model

has to deal with spurious degrees of freedom. An approach to eliminate the

latter from both the Hamiltonian and the basis was suggested. We show that

this procedure does not remove all spurious components from the Hamiltonian

and leads to a restricted set of interactions. We then propose a scheme in

which the physical Hamiltonian can be systematically constructed up to any

order without the need of imposing conditions on its matrix elements.

In

addition, we show that this scheme corresponds to the harmonic limit of a

symmetry adapted algebraic approach based on U (2) algebras.

I. INTRODUCTION

In a recent paper [1], Zhong-Qi Ma et al. proposed a model to describe the vibrational

spectra of tetrahedral molecules and applied it to the methane molecule. The authors assign

to each of the ten interatomic bonds a set of bosonic operators

which satisfy the standard boson commutation relations

The ﬁrst four operators (i = 1, . . . , 4) are chosen to correspond to the C-H bonds (stretching

vibrations), while the last six (i = 5, . . . , 10) represent the H-H bonds (bending vibrations).

The Hamiltonian is then expanded in terms of these operators. For methane they proposed

the following

Td invariant Hamiltonian

ˆH = ˆH1 + ˆH2s + ˆH2b ,

where ˆH1 is a one-body contribution

however, is not obvious when the Hamiltonian is written in the form of Eq. (2)–(4). In [1] the

authors proceed by identifying the spurious states as those containing the fully symmetric,

one-quantum bending state ψ(A1; 100000) as a factor. With a combination of projection

and coupling techniques and an orthogonalization procedure, the physical space up to three

quanta is generated. Next it is shown that the physical Hamiltonian does not couple the

spurious states with the physical states as long as the conditions

λ5 = 0 ,

Xb = 0 ,

(5)

are imposed on the Hamiltonian of Eq. (2). Although these conditions indeed lead to

the correct results, they are too restrictive and, furthermore, do not remove all spurious

interactions.

II. SPURIOUS INTERACTIONS

In this section, we show that the condition of Eq. (5) is not suﬃcient to remove all

spurious interactions from the Hamiltonian. We deﬁne a new set of harmonic bosons with

well deﬁned tensorial properties under the tetrahedral

Td group by projecting the local boson

operators. For the stretching modes we have

with Γ = A1, F2 and for the bending modes

with Γ = A1, E, F2, and similar expressions for the annihilation operators. The coeﬃcients

and βΓ,γ

are the same as those appearing in the projected wave functions of Eq. (3.1-2)

(6)

(7)

in [1].

In the framework of this alternative scheme, both the Hamiltonian and the basis

states are constructed by repeated coupling of these normal bosons. In this way, we obtain

automatically an orthonormal symmetry adapted basis with a well deﬁned number of quanta

in each one of the fundamental vibrational modes. For example, with the usual notation

for the normal modes of methane (ν1, ν2, ν3, ν4), we ﬁnd for two quanta the following basis

Here (. . .)Γ indicates coupling of two quanta to symmetry Γ. These basis states are orthog-

onal, since they correspond to eigenfunctions associated with diﬀerent eigenvalues of the

number operators

This symmetry adapted procedure provides a method to remove the spurious interactions

from the Hamiltonian as well as the spurious states from the basis. It consists in deleting the

tensors which are associated with the spurious bending mode, b†A1 and bA1, in the construction

of physical operators and basis states. This allows an exact elimination of the spurious states

without the need to impose additional conditions on matrix elements.

The Hamiltonian of Eq. (2) does include spurious interactions. This can be seen by

rewriting ˆH in terms of the normal bosons of Eqs. (6) and (7). For the one-body Hamiltonian

of Eq. (3) we ﬁnd

ˆH1 = (ǫs + 3λ1) ˆnA1s + (ǫs −

There are two terms that contain the spurious A1 bending mode. This shows that, in

order to remove the spurious interactions from ˆH1, the condition λ5 = 0 of Eq. (5) is not

suﬃcient. In the present symmetry adapted analysis we ﬁnd two conditions: λ5 = 0 and

ǫb + 5λ2 + λ3 = 0 . We remark that, since the expectation value of ˆnA1b in the physical basis

vanishes, the omission of the second condition has no further consequences.

A similar analysis can be carried out for the interactions in ˆH2s and ˆH2b. The opera-

tors in Eq. (4) represent strong local interactions, and their representation in terms of the

normal operators of Eqs. (6) and (7) acquire a complicated form which involves operators

that transfer quanta between diﬀerent modes. The Hamiltonian ˆH2s only depends on the

stretching modes and hence does not contain spurious interactions. However, the bending

contribution ˆH2b contains terms that transfer quanta between spurious and physical states.

This can be seen by calculating its matrix elements in the basis states with A1 symmetry

that have two quanta in the bending vibrations

with Γ = A1, E and F2, respectively. The states with Γ = E, F2 belong to the physical basis

of Eq. (8), whereas the state with Γ = A1 is spurious. In this basis the matrix elements of

ˆH2b are

The nonvanishing matrix elements in the ﬁrst column and the ﬁrst row show that ˆH2b con-

tains terms which involve the spurious A1 bending mode. For this reason the parameter

Xb in Eq. (4) must vanish in order to remove the spurious contributions from the Hamilto-

nian, in agreement with the result obtained in [1]. However, this condition also removes the

physical part of ˆH2b that couples the states with Γ = E and F2.

(12)

In summary, in this section we have shown that in order to remove the spurious interac-

tions from the Hamiltonian of [1] three conditions have to be fulﬁlled

λ5 = 0 ,

Xb = 0 ,

ǫb + 5λ2 + λ3 = 0 .

(13)

In the calculation of the vibrational spectrum of methane presented in [2], no stretching-

bending interactions were included (Xb = 0). The spurious components in the Hamiltonian

were removed by requiring that its expectation value in the spurious state with one quantum

in the A1 bending mode vanishes. This method only leads to exact results in the harmonic

limit in which it reduces to the last condition of Eq. (13).

An additional comment concerns the basis used in [1]. The basis functions in general

do not carry the quantum numbers that correspond to the number of quanta in each of the

normal vibrational modes. This represents a serious disadvantage in the process of identify-

ing the calculated energies with the experimental ones, which traditionally are reported in

terms of these labels. This problem was overcome in [2] by constucting the physical basis

by means of the

Td Clebsch-Gordan coeﬃcients. We note, however, that in Eq. (3.12) of [2]

the normalization factor

was missing. When this factor is included, the coupling procedure provides an orthonormal

symmetry-adapted basis for the physical space with the desired labels (ν1, ν2, ν3, ν4).

III. SYMMETRY ADAPTED APPROACH

At this point we would like to mention that recently the U(2) model used in [2] has

been further developed [3–6] by elaborating a tensorial formalism analogous to the one

where µ =

Td invariant Hamiltonian is constructed by repeated couplings of these tensors to a total
symmetry A1. For example, the interactions that are at most quadratic in the generators

and conserve the total number of quanta are given by

Here Γ = A1, F2 for stretching vibrations (x = s) and Γ = E, F2 for bending vibrations

which corresponds to the interactions appearing in Eq. (10), with the exception of the spu-

rious interaction which, by construction, does not arise in this approach [6]. The symmetry

adapted basis states are constructed as in [2], but now taking into account the appropriate

normalization coeﬃcients of Eq. (14). The application of this model to the vibrational spec-

trum of methane yields a ﬁt which is an order of magnitude more accurate than those of [1]

and [2].

IV. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

Summarizing, we have analyzed the boson realization model presented by Zhong-Qi Ma

et al. in [1] and found the following results:

(i) The approach presented in [1] does not remove all spurious interactions from the

Hamiltonian. Moreover, the condition Xb = 0 eliminates, in addition to spurious interac-

tions, also some physical interaction terms.

(ii) Although the method proposed to remove the spurious states gives the correct results,

it becomes increasingly diﬃcult to apply when additional higher order interactions have to

be included in the Hamiltonian.

(iii) In general, the basis in which the Hamiltonian is diagonalized does not carry the

quantum numbers associated to the number of quanta in each fundamental vibrational

mode. This problem can be solved either by using the

Td Clebsch-Gordan coeﬃcients or by

diagonalizing the number operators of Eq. (9).

(iv) The formulation in terms of tensor operators provides a natural way to eliminate

the spurious interactions from the Hamiltonian. Besides, we have shown that the approach

of [1] corresponds to the harmonic limit of a more general method based on coupled U(2)

algebras [3–6].

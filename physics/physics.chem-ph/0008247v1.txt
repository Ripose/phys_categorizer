Abstract

A quantum ﬂuid dynamic(QFD) control formulation is presented for optimally

manipulating atomic and molecular systems. In QFD the control quantum system is ex-

pressed in terms of the probability density ρ and the quantum current j. This choice of

variables is motivated by the generally expected slowly varying spatial-temporal depen-

dence of the ﬂuid dynamical variables. The QFD approach is illustrated for manipulation

of the ground electronic state dynamics of HCl induced by an external electric ﬁeld.

I. INTRODUCTION

Manipulating the outcome of quantum dynamics phenomena by a properly tailored

external control is a topic of increasing activity [1-15]. Problems where the external con-

trol is electromagnetic have received the most attention, although other applications arise

as well. Various implementations of quantum control have been experimentally realized

[16-25]. A variety of control strategies have been suggested, and optimal control the-

ory(OCT) provides the most general framework for acheiving ﬁeld designs. Such designs

will generally require further reﬁnement in the laboratory through learning techniques to

overcome design uncertainities [17-20]. A basic diﬃculty in attaining the control designs

is the computational eﬀort called for in solving the time-dependent Schroedinger equa-

tion, often repeatedly in an iterative fashion. This paper introduces the quantum ﬂuid

dynamic(QFD) control formulation to simplify this task. Calculations have shown [28,

29] that QFD is capable of being much more eﬃcient than conventional methods(e.g.,

FFT propagation), and this savings should carry over to the control design task. This

paper will show how OCT can be combined with QFD.

The theoretical basis for dynamic control [2-13] is to create non-stationary states of

one’s choice, by optimally designing the control ﬁeld. Typically, the problem is posed as

seeking an optimal ﬁeld to drive a quantum wave packet to a desired target at a chosen

2

time t=T. In the traditional approach [3-10] to quantum optimal control an objective
design functional ¯J is deﬁned, which depends on the system wave function, a wave function

like Lagrange multiplier, and the external ﬁeld. Minimization of the objective functional

leads to the identiﬁcation of external ﬁeld(s) capable of delivering a speciﬁc outcome.

This process requires solving for the complex oscillatory wave function and the similarly

behaved Lagrange multiplier, and due care is needed for their proper representation in a

suitable basis for capturing their behaviour. Often the rapidly varying spatio-temporal

behaviour of these functions necesitates the use of many unknowns in the basis.

This paper explores an alternative formulation for OCT to design the electric ﬁeld.

The formulation is based on the ﬂuid dynamic view point of quantum mechanics [26-

29], which by-passes the typically oscillatory nature of the wave function to exploit the

generally smooth behaviour of the real density and the quantum current variables. Recent

illustrations have demonstrated the smooth spatial and temporal nature of the variables

and the ability to discretize them on a relatively small number of grid points [28, 29].

As background in section 2 we give a brief summary of the QFD formulation of quantum

mechanics. Section 3 presents OCT within the framework of QFD for designing an electric

ﬁeld to meet a speciﬁc objective. Section 4 applies the OCT-QFD formulation for the

manipulation of HCl. Section 5 concludes the paper.

II. QUANTUM FLUID DYNAMICS

The treatment below considers a single particle of reduced mass m, but

the QFD formulation has an immediate extension to many particles. The time-dependent

Schr¨odinger equation is given by

[−

¯h2
2m

∇2 + V + Vext]Ψ(x, t) = i¯h

∂
∂t

Ψ(x, t)

(1)

where V typically conﬁnes the particle in a locale and Vext is the control taken here as

−µ(x) · E(t) with E(t) being the electric ﬁeld and µ(x) the dipole moment. Substituting

Ψ(x, t) = A(x, t)eiS(x,t)/¯h, where A and S are real functions, into Eq.(1) and separating

3

the real and imaginary parts one easily obtains two equations. The imaginary part yields

the continuity equation

∂ρ
∂t

+ ∇ · (ρv) = 0

and the real part the following equation for the phase S

∂S
∂t

+

∇S · ∇S

2m

+ Vef f = 0

(2)

(3)

where Vef f = V + Vext + Vq with Vq = − ¯h2
2m
and v= ∇S
m .

∇2ρ1/2
ρ1/2 = − ¯h2

2m[∇2lnρ1/2 + (∇lnρ1/2)2], ρ = |Ψ|2

Equation (3) has the form of the classical Hamilton-Jacobi equation with an extra

’quantum potential’ term Vq. This equation can be transformed into one for the evolution

of the velocity vector v by taking the gradient to give

∂
∂t

v = −(v · ∇)v −

1
m

∇(Vef f )

(4)

Deﬁning the quantum current as

j(x, t) = −

¯h
m

Im[Ψ∗(x, t)∇Ψ(x, t)] = ρ(x, t)v(x, t),

one readily obtains the equation of motion for j by substitution of ∂ρ

∂t and ∂

∂t v from Eqs.(2)

and (4) as

∂
∂t

j = −v(∇ · j) − (j · ∇)v −

ρ
m

∇Vef f

(5)

Eqs.(2) and (3) or (2) and (5) describe the motion of a quantum particle within the QFD

formulation of quantum mechanics. The motion of a quantum particle is governed by

the current vector j and the density ρ in Eqs.(2) and (5). Although the QFD equations

resemble those of classical ﬂuid dynamics, their quantum identity prevails due to the

presence of the potential Vq which has no classical analogue. Equivalently, the QFD

equations may be viewed as those of a “classical” ﬂuid with a highly non-linear constitutive

law prescribed by Vef f . Various Eulerian or Lagrangian means can be exploited to solve

the QFD equations [28,29], and available ﬂuid dynamics codes may be adopted to treat

4

these equations [30]. The essential simplifying feature of the QFD equations is that ρ

and j or ρ and S are often slowly varying, which is evident from quantum dynamics

calculations [28,29], thereby permitting relatively coarse gridding. Despite the non-linear

nature of the QFD equations, the general smoothness of ρ and j observed lead to signiﬁcant

computational savings [28,29].

III. CONTROL EXPRESSED WITHIN QUANTUM FLUID

DYNAMICS

Quantum OCT seeks the design of an external ﬁeld to fulﬁll a particular dynamical

objective. This section will provide the working equations for OCT-QFD to design an

optimal electric ﬁeld that drives a quantum wave packet to a desired objective at the

target time t=T. The OCT-QFD formulation could be expressed in the usual way in

terms of the Schr¨odinger equation where QFD would only act as a solution procedure.

Here we will present a general approach by writing OCT directly in terms of QFD. As

an example the control of a non-rotating diatomic molecule will be used as a simple

illustration of the concepts. The treatment of a fully general target expectation value

ΘT =< Ψ(T )|Θ|Ψ(T ) > may be considered with QFD, but here we will only treat the

common case where the operator Θ(x) is only position x dependent. Then the goal is to

steer ΘT

ΘT = Z xr

xl

Θ(x)ρ(x, T )dx

(6)

as close as possible to the desired value Θd.

The active spatial control interval is taken as xl ≤ x ≤ xr over the time 0 ≤ t ≤ T that

the control process occurs. We desire to minimize the cost functional Jcost = Jtarget +Jf ield

where Jtarget and Jf ield are given by

Jtarget =

1
2

ωx(ΘT − Θd)2

and

Jf ield =

1
2

ωe Z T

0

E2(t)dt

(7)

with ωe and ωx being the positive weights balancing the signiﬁcance of the two terms.

The second term represents the penalty due to the ﬂuence of the external ﬁeld. The

5

minimization of Jcost with respect to E(t) must be subject to the satisfaction of the

equations of motion for ρ and j in Eqs.(2) and (5). We may fulﬁll this constraint by

introducing the unconstrained cost functional as

0 Z xr

¯J = Jcost − Z T

where λ1(x, t) and λ2(x, t) are Lagrange’s multiplier functions.

An optimal solution satisﬁes δ ¯J = 0, which is assured by setting each of the functional

derivatives with respect to λ1, λ2, ρ, j and E to zero. The ﬁrst two, i.e., the functional

derivatives with respect to λ1 and λ2 regenerate the QFD equations in Eq.(2) and (5).

(16)

Several other constraint expressions can be obtained by using equivalent forms of the

continuity and dynamical equations. The form presented above is used in the subsequent

numerical calculations. An alternative form in multi-dimensions symmetric between the

QFD and Lagrange multiplier functions is presented in the Appendix.

The equations (9) and (10) for λ2 and λ1 respectively ressemble that of ρ and j with

the only diﬀerence being the extra source terms S1 and S2. The source terms depend on ρ

and j. vλ in the above equations is the ’velocity’ associated with the Lagrange’s multiplier
and is given as vλ = λ1
λ2

. There are now two diﬀerent quantum potential terms, one of

which is a function of ρ(x, t) and the other is a function of λ2(x, t). In this formalism

the evolution of λ1(x, t) takes place by Vq(λ2) as well as the diﬀerence of the two types

of quantum potential. In obtaining the above equations we have standardly assumed no

variation of either ρ(x, 0) or j(x,0). Thus, we start from the initial value of ρ(x, 0) and

j(x,0) to solve Eqs.(2) and (5). Eqs.(9) and (10) can be solved for λ2(x, t) and λ1(x, t)

by integrating backward from time T using λ1(x, T ) and λ2(x, T ) given in Eqs.(15) and

(16) respectively. The equations (2), (5), (9) and (10) are non-linear thereby calling for

iteration to solve(cf., the algorithm in Section 4). Finally the desired control electric ﬁeld

is given from Eq.(11) as

4 APPLICATION TO HCL

The OCT-QFD formulation will be applied to manipulating the vibrational motion of

HCl on the ground electronic state. The initial density ρ(x, 0) = |Ψ(x)|2 was obtained

from solving for the vibrational state from the equation

HCl molecule and V (x) is the truncated polynomial presented by Olgilvie [33]

entering the potential function are a1 = 0.961914, a2 = −1.362999, a3 = 0.86675, a4 =

−0.49804, a5 = 0.1727, a6 = 0.2687, a7 = −1.977, a8 = 2.78, a9 = 4.89, b1 = 0.169695

and A = −4.85 × 10−2. Since Ψ(x) is a stationary real function we have zero initial ﬂux

j(x,0)=0. The initial ρ(x, 0) is nearly a Gaussian packet centered around xe. The dipole

function for HCl is given by [34]

µ(x) = c1[g(x) + c2g2(x) + c3g3(x)]

(20)

where g(x) = 1 − tanh(β(x − xd)) and the parameters are c1 = 0.279, c2 = −0.905,

c3 = 1.029, β = 0.687 and xd = 2.555. The following steps were carried out for imple-

mentation of the present OCT-QFD algorithm :

Step 1: Make an initial guess for the electric ﬁeld E(t), which was zero in the

present calculations.

Step 2:

Solve the coupled equations, viz., Eq.(2) and (5) for ρ(x, t) and

j(x,t) respectively starting from ρ(x, 0) and j(x,0). The solution was

8

achieved here by using the Flux-corrected transport(FCT) algorithm

[35] modiﬁed for the purpose of solving the QFD equations [28]. In

doing so, we adopt the Eulerian numerical scheme.

Step 3: Evaluate the ﬁnal value for λ1(x, T ) given by Eq.(15) and set

λ2(x, T )=0 by Eq.(16).

Step 4:

Solve Eqs.(9) and (10) for λ2(x, t) and λ1(x, t), respectively, by back-

ward propagation using the same method as in step 2. Equations

(9) and (10) have source terms which depend on ρ(x, t) and j(x,t)

calculated from step 2.

Step 5: Calculate the diﬀerence between the left and right sides of Eq.(16)

for use in the conjugate gradient method [36] and calculate Jcost from

Eq.(7).

Step 6:

Iterate steps 2 to step 6 until acceptable convergence is met.

The spatial range of the calculation was 0 ≤ x ≤ 12 a.u., and the time interval was

0 ≤ t ≤ T with T=2000 a.u. The total number of spatial mesh points is 64 which gives

∆x = 0.1875 a.u. Similarly, the total number of time steps was 2048, which corresponds

to ∆t = 0.9765 a.u. No special eﬀort was made to optimize the grid points, as the purpose

here is to demonstrate the QFD-OCT formulation. The weight ωe in Eq.(7) was taken as
2, and ωx = 1000. The target operator was Θ = x and Θd = 3.0a.u..

1

Figure 1 shows the control ﬁeld in atomic units. The slightly non-zero values of the

ﬁeld at the beginning and end could be arrested by placing additional costs if desired.

This pulse excites several vibrational states(not shown here) mainly by a sequence of

single quantum transitions. Figure 2 shows the average distance < x > as a function of

time. The desired control value of < x >=3.0 a.u. at T is obtained through oscillatory

motion of the packet. The packet is distorted in shape(not shown) while approximately

retaining its original variance during the evolution. During the optimization process the

total integrated probability density remained at unity up to a deviation of 10−5. The

iteration algorithm takes 10 steps to achieve the results shown here at 2 CPU mins. on

9

an IRIX Silicon Graphics Machine(Release 6.1). Within numerical precision the results

were the same as obtained by solving the original Schr¨odinger equation.

5. CONCLUSION

This paper presents a new QFD based approach for carrying out the optimal design of

control ﬁelds with an illustration for the maniputation of the HCl molecule. Our previous

work [28] shows the typical smooth and monotonic behaviour of the ﬂuid dynamical

variables, viz., S and v as opposed to the typical oscillations in the wave functions where

the hamiltonian was time independent. In the present case where the system is driven

with an optimal time-dependent external ﬁeld we have calculated the spatial dependence

of j, ρ, S and Ψ at t=T shown in Fig.3. The ﬂuid dynamical variables(Fig.3 curves (a),

(b) and (c)) used in the present method are relatively slowly varying spatial functions

compared to the wave function(Fig.3, curve(d)) which apparently enhances the eﬃciency

and the numerical saving of the present approach to controlling dynamics.

Although the illustration was for one dimension the QFD technique is directly extend-

able to higher dimensions, and a QFD wave packet calculation in four dimension has

already been performed [28]. The alternating direction method can eﬀectively be used

with QFD for high dimensions. Comparison with FFT propagation has been performed

for two dimensional systems [29], showing that QFD is capable of providing a considerable

increase in eﬃciency(i.e., by a factor of 10 or more). Regardless of the dimension, the key

advantage of OCT-QFD arises from the expected smooth nature of QFD variables. A spe-

cial circumstance will arise if the control “exactly” leads to a bound state with nodes that

fully separates one spatial region from another. In practice placing a lower limit on the

density of the order of the machine precision overcomes such diﬃculties. Future studies

need to explore the full capabilities of the computational savings aﬀorded by OCT-QFD.

The ﬁrst two formulas in A.9 are equivalent to the Schr¨odinger equation. They can

be transformed into various QFD forms in terms of ρ, v and j as in Eqs.(2) to (5) in

the main text. The third and fourth equations in A.9 are the basic equations for the

Lagrange multiplier functions. They are in the same ﬂux conservation form as the QFD

equations. Indeed, the third equation multiplied by λ1 can be rearranged in the form of

mass conservation for Λ1 = λ2

1 as

λ1λ2(∇2A/A − ∇2λ2/λ2)]

The above derivation also can be obtained starting with the usual Schr¨odinger equation

and its complex conjugate. Following this approach the cost functional below assures that

the external ﬁeld is real

With the substitution Ψ = Aexp(iS), the cost functional reduces to the one in Eq.(A.8)

with λ = λ1 + iλ2.

Abstract

In studies of interfaces with dynamic chemical composition, bulk and interfacial quantities are often
coupled via surface conservation laws of excess surface quantities. While this approach is easily justiﬁed
for microscopically sharp interfaces, its applicability in the context of microscopically diﬀuse interfaces
is less theoretically well-established. Furthermore, surface conservation laws (and interfacial models
in general) are often derived phenomenologically rather than systematically.
In this article, we ﬁrst
provide a mathematically rigorous justiﬁcation for surface conservation laws at diﬀuse interfaces based
on an asymptotic analysis of transport processes in the boundary layer and derive general formulae for
the surface and normal ﬂuxes that appear in surface conservation laws. Next, we use non-equilibrium
thermodynamics to formulate surface conservation laws in terms of chemical potentials and provide
a method for systematically deriving the structure of the interfacial layer. Finally, we derive surface
conservation laws for a few examples from diﬀusive and electrochemical transport.

Keywords: surface conservation laws; transport theory; interface structure; asymptotic analysis

Introduction

It is well-known that the chemical composition of an interface plays an important role in its dynamics
(both its motion and the evolution of its chemical composition). A few interesting and important examples
include the eﬀect of surfactants on surface tension [1, 2, 3], the charging dynamics of electrochemical double
layers [4, 5, 6, 7, 8], electrokinetic phenomena [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20] and soap ﬁlm
dynamics [21, 22]. Unfortunately, theoretical modeling of the interaction between chemical composition
and interfacial dynamics can be quite challenging because it involves coupling dynamics at the macroscopic
scale away from the interface with a microscopic model for the interfacial region. Sometimes it may not
even be clear which microscopic model is appropriate for a particular problem. Many successful approaches
based on the notion of an excess surface concentration [23, 24] have been developed and applied to a wide-
range of problems. While this approach is well-founded for microscopically sharp interfaces, the theoretical

foundations for this methodology in the context of microscopically diﬀuse interfaces (especially for dynamic
interfaces) do not appear to have been thoroughly explored.

For microscopically diﬀuse interfaces (i.e., interfaces where the chemical composition smoothly varies
across the interface), the notion of a surface excess concentration and dynamics of surface excess quantities
can be rigorously justiﬁed via asymptotic analysis. In this article, we present a general procedure for deriving
surface conservation laws (including derivation of the structure of the interfacial layer) that couple dynamics
in the bulk with dynamics of the interfacial region and demonstrate the application of our formulation to
example problems in diﬀusive and electrochemical transport. Our results are only valid in “sharp interface”
limit (i.e., when the distance over which the volume density of the diﬀuse species varies is small relative to
macroscopic length scales of the problem). Fortunately, this limit is the only one that is physically meaningful
– if an interface is too diﬀuse, it may not be appropriate to treat it as an interface in the ﬁrst place.

Previous work involving surface conservation laws focuses primarily on deriving the appropriate surface
In contrast, our derivation is much
conservation law in the context of speciﬁc problems [10, 4, 5, 6, 7].
more general and applicable to a wide range of transport problems. We only require that, near the surface,
the ﬂux for the transport process scales in the same manner as a linear combination of gradients of ﬁeld
variables. Fortunately, these types of ﬂuxes are very common in transport theory [25]. We emphasize that the
formulation of surface conservation laws we present is not based on ad-hoc physical arguments; rather, they
are a direct consequence of the asymptotic analysis. Moreover, the generality of our formulation allows us to
derive surface conservation laws for nonlinear transport processes when the bulk is far from equilibrium (e.g.,
electrochemical transport of around metallic particles at large applied ﬁelds) and for systems with complex
interfacial structure. To the authors’ knowledge, surface conservation laws for these types of problems have
not been previously derived.

1.1 Dimensionless Formulation of Equations

To facilitate the mathematical analysis presented in this article, it is convenient to examine all equations in
nondimensional form. To avoid confusion when reintroducing dimensions, let us take a moment to ﬁx the
physical scales used in the nondimensionalization process. At the macroscopic scale, the spatial coordinates,
(X, Y, Z), are scaled by the the characteristic size of the system, L. At the microscopic scale, the tangential,
(x, y), and normal, z, spatial coordinates are scaled by L and δ, respectively, where δ is the characteristic
thickness of the interfacial layer. Time, t, is scaled by the bulk diﬀusion time scale, τ = L2/D. Concen-
trations, ci, are nondimensionalized by taking the reference concentration to be the maximum physically
realizable concentration, cmax. Bulk, Fi, and surface ﬂuxes, Ji, are scaled using cmaxL/τ and cmaxL2/τ ,
respectively. The electric potential, φ, is scaled by the thermal voltage kBT /e, where kB is Boltzmann’s
constant and e is the absolute charge of an electron. Finally, all thermodynamic energy variables (e.g., U
and F ), and entropy, S, are scaled using kBT (the thermal energy) and kB, respectively. The dimensional
form of any of the equations in the remainder of this article can be obtained by ﬁrst replacing each dimen-
sionless variable with its associated dimensional variable divided by the appropriate characteristic scale and
then multiplying the entire equation by an appropriate physical scale to restore units to the equation1. For
instance, if the dimensionless concentration, c, appears in a dimensionless equation, it should be replaced by
C/cmax when re-dimensionalizing the equation.

2 Excess Surface Concentrations

When studying chemically active interfaces, the state of the interface is commonly described at macroscopic
Intuitively, excess surface

concentrations are deﬁned as the amount of material per unit area of surface after the material in the “bulk”
has been removed from the interfacial region. However, this deﬁnition is physically and mathematically
ambiguous – in the region near the interface, how is one to distinguish between material that is part of the
bulk and material that is part of the interface? The ambiguity of this deﬁnition was recognized long ago by
Gibbs [26, 27, 28] and is typically dealt with by arbitrarily selecting a concentration, C∗, at some point within
the interface (when viewed at a microscopic length scale) to be the reference “bulk” concentration [23, 24, 29].
Any deviation of the concentration near the interface from C∗ is treated as a contribution to the excess surface
concentration. In terms of this reference concentration, the excess surface concentration is deﬁned as the
integral of (C

C∗) over the thickness of the interface.

While somewhat inelegant from a theoretical perspective, this formulation of excess surface concentration
has been used quite successfully for studying interfaces of equilibrium systems. For systems in thermal
equilibrium, the excess surface concentrations can be related to other thermodynamic variables, such as
bulk concentrations and other excess surface concentrations via adsorption isotherms [30, 1, 23, 24, 31].
However, when the dynamics of surface species is important (e.g., fast adsorption-desorption kinetics, non-
negligible surface-diﬀusion), isotherm models need to be replaced by surface conservation laws for the excess
surface concentrations which provide dynamic coupling between bulk concentrations and excess surface
concentrations:

Here Γ, Js and Jn are the surface excess concentration, the surface ﬂux and the normal ﬂux,
∇s denotes a
surface derivative, and the sign on the normal ﬂux is chosen to be positive when the ﬂux is into the boundary
layer (see Figure 1). In this situation, the thermodynamic deﬁnition of excess surface concentrations becomes
unsatisfactory because all of the variables in (1) depend on implicitly on the choice of C∗ whose governing

concentration Γ and the surface ﬂuxes Js are deﬁned only on the interface itself.

Fortunately, for many problems, there is a natural way to deﬁne C∗ in terms of bulk concentrations
(which almost always have relatively straightforward governing equations). Deﬁne C∗ to be the limit of the
corresponding bulk concentration, C(x), as x approaches the interface. Unlike thermodynamic deﬁnitions
of the excess concentration which are deﬁned in terms of a reference concentration chosen at microscopic
length scales and suﬀer from the diﬃculty of relating that reference concentration to macroscopic variables,
the choice of C∗ just described is directly related to macroscopic variables because it is explicitly deﬁned in
terms of those variables. Note that C∗ is not necessarily a constant; it may still be a function of position
along the surface of the interface.

3 Surface Conservation Laws

Equation (1) seems physically intuitive: the time rate of change in the surface concentration results from
a combination of surface diﬀusion and ﬂux from the bulk. However, it is important to remember that the
equation describes the evolution of excess concentrations, not absolute concentrations. Thus, Js and Jn must
be carefully deﬁned so that they contribute solely to changes in the excess concentration, not to changes in
reference concentration C∗.

For microscopically sharp interfaces, such as the monolayer interfaces that arise in problems involving
surfactants at liquid-gas interfaces [1, 2, 3] or the compact layer in electrochemical systems [30, 24], Js and
Jn are very simply deﬁned because the bulk truly extends all the way to the interface. As a result, the excess
surface concentration is the amount of material per unit surface area that resides precisely on the interface.
In other words, the excess surface concentration is the absolute surface concentration. Thus, the surface
can truly be thought of as a distinct phase, and a conservation law argument based on a balance of ﬂuxes
into a “control volume” on the interface is mathematically valid. As a result, Jn is the ﬂux of bulk material
normal to the surface and Js is the ﬂux within the surface itself driven by transport processes intrinsic to
the interface (e.g., surface diﬀusion in an lipid bilayer).

That surface conservation laws hold for microscopically sharp interfaces is not surprising. What is
interesting is that Js and Jn can be deﬁned in such a way that surface conservation laws also hold for
microscopically diﬀuse interfaces (see Figure 2). For instance, in their studies of the evolution of surface

represents the outer “edge” of the boundary layer, which is not at a mathematically
well-deﬁned location. Note that in addition to the ﬂuxes within the boundary
layer, it is possible for the interface to possess ﬂuxes that physically reside on the
microscopic interface itself. For some systems, these “microscopic” surface ﬂuxes
may provide a signiﬁcant contribution to the total surface ﬂux in the boundary
layer.

excess concentrations of electrolyte around colloid particles [10, 4, 5], Dukhin, Deryagin, and Shilov made
use of surface conservation laws for excess ion concentration to couple ion transport in the bulk to the
behavior of the electrical double layer. A key observation about microscopically diﬀuse interfaces is that
surface transport within the boundary layer near the interface is driven by the same transport processes that
occur in the bulk. In contrast, at microscopically sharp interfaces, surface transport could potentially be
completely diﬀerent from bulk transport because the underlying physical processes driving surface transport
(which are related to the speciﬁc nature of the interface) might be fundamentally diﬀerent.

Unfortunately, the derivation of surface conservation laws for microscopically sharp interfaces is not valid
for diﬀuse interfaces because the notion of a surface “control volume” is no longer well-deﬁned. The main
problem is the lack of a distinct separation between the bulk and the interfacial region. Rather, there is a
thin region near the interface over which concentrations vary rapidly. Intuitively, what we would like to do
is deﬁne surface quantities by directly integrating over the boundary layer. This procedure, however, must
be carried out carefully in order to obtain physically meaningful results. The basic idea in deriving surface
conservation laws, which we shall elaborate on in the next section, is that all integrations over the boundary
layer should involve only excess quantities; integration of absolute quantities leads to divergent results.

Before deriving the general form for Js and Jn involved in surface conservation laws for microscopically
diﬀuse interfaces, we mention that (1) neglects contributions due to motion and deformation of the interface
(e.g., terms involving convection in the normal direction and surface dilation [11, 32, 33]). Since our analysis
sheds no new insight for these terms, we shall ignore them to simplify the discussion.

3.1 Derivation of Equation (1) for Microscopically Diﬀuse Interfaces

To derive the form of the ﬂuxes for surface conservation laws at microscopically diﬀuse interfaces, our goal
is to identify the appropriate deﬁnitions for Js and Jn (in terms of macroscopic variables) that will allow us
to write surface conservation laws of the form (1). We begin by writing the conservation laws that govern

the time evolution of a chemical species in the bulk:

F,

−∇ ·

where c is the concentration and F is the ﬂux. For our derivation, we assume that there is no ﬂux of
material through the interface3 itself so that ∂F/∂n = 0 and that the spatial coordinates in (2) have
been nondimensionalized using a characteristic macroscopic length scale. In these units, the thickness of
the boundary layer over which c varies rapidly is O(ǫ), where ǫ
δ/L is the ratio of the interfacial and
macroscopic length scales.

using (2) for the outer equations and deriving the inner equations by appropriately rescaling the spatial
coordinates.
In this discussion, we shall distinguish inner and outer variables by using the hat (ˆ) and
bar accents (¯), respectively. Also, we shall use (X, Y, Z) (upper case variables) and (x, y, z) (lower case
variables) to represent the outer and inner spatial coordinates, respectively. Since the focus will be on the
region immediately neighboring the surface, we shall take (x, y) to be Cartesian coordinates tangential to
the interface and z to the coordinate normal to the interface.

Rescaling (2) using the inner coordinates (x, y, ǫz) = (X, Y, Z), we ﬁnd that the governing equations in

the boundary layer are

ˆFs −
where the subscripts s and n indicate tangential and normal components of the ﬂux and divergence operator,
respectively. Note that in (3), we have implicitly assumed that in changing to the inner coordinates, the
normal derivative of the normal ﬂux ˆFn picks up a factor of 1/ǫ because

This relationship between the inner and outer normal ﬂuxes is a direct consequence of our requirement that,
near the interface, F scales in the same manner as a linear combination of gradients of macroscopic ﬁeld
variables:

ˆFn(x, y, z) = ǫ ¯Fn(X, Y, Z).

F =

where fi are arbitrary functions of c1, c2, . . . , cn. For ﬂuxes of the form (5), the factor of ǫ in (4) arises
from the fact that the ﬂux itself involves derivatives of space. We emphasize, however, that for our general
analysis, we only require that ﬂuxes satisfy (4) without regard for the origin of this relationship.

In deriving (1), the intuitive idea of just integrating (3) from z = 0 to z =

is inadequate because it
leads to divergent integrals which are physically and mathematically meaningless. The key idea to keep in
mind when asymptotically integrating over boundary layers is that only excess concentrations are integrable,
absolute concentrations are not.

Using this basic principle, we can systematically derive (1) by starting with the excess (volume) concen-

The problem with the intuitive approach is that it makes the mistake of equating the asymptotic limit
. Realizing this subtle distinction (which is safe to neglect for many
ǫ
asymptotic analyses), we can reformulate the integration over the boundary layer as the limit of a sequence
of integrals over ﬁnite intervals, which tends to the entire half-space [0,
0. In choosing the domain
of integration, we want to be sure to capture the entire boundary layer so that the notion of the total
surface excess concentration is physically meaningful. In addition, we want the region of integration at the

We can simultaneously achieve both of these goals by taking the region of integration at the macroscopic
length scale (i.e., where Z is the variable in the normal direction) to be [0, α] where α = O(ǫp) with 0 < p < 1.
Since the width of the boundary layer is O(ǫ), this choice of α ensures that the integration region completely
covers the boundary layer but tends to 0 in the asymptotic limit.

It is worth mentioning that the presence of the ǫ in the time dependent term and the surface ﬂux term
in (14) indicates that the relative importance of these terms relative to bulk transport (i.e., the normal ﬂux
term) may depend on the choice of time-scales and the magnitude of surface transport. This observation is
elaborated upon in the examples discussed below.

where the Lij are mobility coeﬃcients4 that relate the drift velocity of species i to the gradient of the chemical

must vanish.

coeﬃcients are constant in the normal direction and slowly varying in the tangential direction. Equation
(21) has the following physical interpretation: in the sharp interface limit (i.e., ǫ
0), the interfacial layer
is always in quasi-equilibrium at the bulk diﬀusion time scale, τ = L2/D. It is important to note that at
faster time scales, which may be appropriate for systems with external forcing, this result may break down
because the time derivative term could balance the normal ﬂux term when (3) is rescaled to the faster time

It is worth mentioning that the surface transport term (the term involving the surface divergence) does not
always contribute to the leading order surface conservation law. Whether the surface transport term must be
retained at leading order depends on the magnitudes of Γi (which depends implicitly on bulk ﬁeld variables)
and the tangential component of bulk chemical potential gradients. Interestingly, when the surface transport
term is signiﬁcant, the surface conservation law depends explicitly on the small parameter ǫ (through Γi).

4.1 Theoretical Derivation of Interfacial Structure

While surface conservation laws may be derived by substituting arbitrary models for the structure of the
boundary layer into (15), (16), (17), the quasi-equilibrium nature of the interfacial layer allows us to the-
oretically derive the boundary layer structure from the chemical potential using (22). Starting with a free
energy for the system that incorporates the physical eﬀects we wish to include, chemical potentials may be
easily computed as the functional derivatives of the free energy with respect to the concentrations of the
individual species5:

µi = δF/δci,

(25)

where F is the total free energy of the system. Thus, formulating the transport equations in terms of chemical
potentials yields a systematic method for deriving boundary layer structure and surface conservation laws
directly from fundamental physical principles without resorting to ad-hoc models for the interfacial layer.
We shall demonstrate this general approach for several example problems in the next few sections.

5 Applications to Neutral Solutes

In this section, we present surface conservation laws for neutral solutions. Because we have formulated surface
conservation laws in terms of chemical potentials, derivation of the integrated ﬂuxes for these systems is a
straightforward application of the formulae in Section 4. For simplicity, we shall assume that ﬂuid ﬂow is
absent.

5.1 Dilute Solutions

For dilute solutions of a single neutral species, we can write the free energy, F , for the system as

F = U

T S =

cΦ + c (log c

1) dx,

−

Z

−

where U , T , and S are the internal energy, the absolute temperature (scaled to 1 in dimensionless units),
and entropy of the system, respectively, c is the concentration of solute, and Φ is the energy of interaction
between solute particles and the surface (per unit concentration of solute particles). Note that the free energy
density per unit concentration of solute in (26) is determined up to an arbitrary additive constant, which
we take to be
kT in dimensional form) to simplify the expression for the chemical potential (derived
below). The interaction energy, Φ(z), between solute particles and the surface extends over a distance ǫ
(typically a few molecular diameters) and can account for hydrophobic interactions, polarization eﬀects, etc.
Φ(z) essentially gives the aﬃnity of the solute particles for the surface. Note that in the dilute solution
approximation, solute particles do not directly interact with each other or with solvent particles.

(31)

As we showed in Section 4, in the interfacial layer, ˆµ is equal to µ∗ in the normal direction, which leads to
a Boltzmann distribution for the concentration:

We can rewrite this expression in terms of the bulk concentration just outside of the interfacial layer by
observing that c∗ = eµ
from asymptotic matching and the fact that the solute surface interaction decays
far away from the surface. Thus, we ﬁnd that

∗

ˆc(z) = exp (µ∗

Φ(z)) .

−

ˆc(z) = c∗e−Φ(z).

Note that this is exactly the boundary layer proﬁle obtained by Anderson et al. using the assumption that
the interfacial layer is in equilibrium [37].

The surface excess concentration of solute, Γ, is the integral of the excess concentration over the boundary

layer:

After the integral in this expression has been explicitly evaluated, the surface conservation law for dilute
solutions of neutral solutes is derived by substituting the surface excess concentration (30) and the chemical
potential (27) into (24), which leads to the following transport equation for the surface excess concentration:

where L is the nondimensional mobility coeﬃcient for solute particles. It is interesting to observe that the
driving force for surface transport and the source term for transport between the bulk and interfacial regions
depend only on the concentration in the bulk. This result is generally true for transport problems where
ﬂuid ﬂow is negligible.

5.2 Concentrated Solutions

For concentrated solutions of a single neutral species, the size of the individual solute particles cannot be
neglected and steric eﬀects must be accounted for. Concentrated solution theory provides a model which
qualitatively accounts for these eﬀects. Bulk solutions are considered concentrated when the dimensionless
parameter ν = a3cmax, which represents the bulk volume fraction of solute, is not small. In this case, we
must use concentrated solution theory to describe bulk transport. However, even when ν
1, concentrated
solution theory may be necessary if the surface interaction energy, Φ, is strong enough to condense particles
near the surface. As for dilute solutions, we begin by writing the free energy for the system using ideal
solution theory [38]:

≪

F = U

T S =

cΦ + [c log c + (1

c) log (1

c)] dx,

(32)

−

−

−

where the last term in F accounts for then entropy of the solvent (i.e., steric eﬀects) and we have assumed
that solute and solvent molecules have the same size. Taking the functional derivative of this expression, we
ﬁnd that the chemical potential for concentrated solutions is given by

µ = log

+ Φ.

(33)

c

(cid:18)

c

(cid:19)

−

11

Note that unlike dilute solutions, there is a maximum concentration for the solute that arises from the sharp
increase in the chemical potential at high solute concentrations (low solvent concentrations) caused by the
solvent’s entropic contribution to the free energy.

As before, we can derive the concentration proﬁle of solute atoms by using the fact that, within the

interfacial layer, the chemical potential is constant in the direction normal to the surface:

ˆc(z) = exp (µ∗

Φ(z)) [1 + exp (µ∗

Φ(z))]−1 .

−

−

(34)

For concentrated solutions, the simple Boltzmann distribution for the quasi-equilibrium concentration proﬁle
in the normal direction is replaced by a Fermi-Dirac-like distribution with a maximum concentration of 1
(cmax = 1/a3 in dimensional form). Note that expression of ˆc(z) in terms of the bulk concentration, c∗,
outside of the interfacial layer does not lead to a signiﬁcant simpliﬁcation of (34). The surface excess
concentration is found by integrating (34) over the interfacial layer.

To derive the surface conservation law for concentrated neutral solutions, we substitute (33) and the
expression for the surface excess concentration into the general formula for the surface conservation law in
terms of chemical potentials (24).

6 Application to Electrolytes

In electrochemical systems, the solute particles are electrically charged, so transport processes are aﬀected
by electric ﬁelds (both self-generated and externally applied). When modeling electrochemical systems, it is
common to model transport in the bulk separately from the response of the double layer at surfaces. Surface
conservation laws justify and generalize the usual phenomenological approaches for coupling bulk and double
layer dynamics. In this section, we discuss surface conservation laws for dilute and concentrated electrolyte
solutions. As we shall see, the key diﬀerence between these two cases is the microscopic model that must be
used to describe the electrical double layer.

For electrolytes, transport is driven by gradients in the electrochemical potential, so the nondimension-

alized conservation laws for ionic species are given by

∂ci
∂t

=

∇ ·

µi + civ) ,

(ci∇
where ci are the concentration of ion i, µi is the electrochemical potential for species i, v is the ﬂuid velocity,
and we have assumed that all of the ions have the same diﬀusivity [31]. Note that the ﬂux in this equation
is just a special case of (18) where Lij is an identity matrix6. While ﬂuid ﬂow plays an important role in
many systems of current interest (e.g., electrokinetic microﬂuidic pumps and mixers [13, 14, 19, 20]), we
shall neglect it to keep the following discussion simple. In this situation, the surface conservation law (24)
becomes

(35)

(Γi∇sµ∗
i )
Before considering ion transport in various special cases, we mention that for electrochemical systems,
the small parameter ǫ is the ratio of the Debye screening length, λD, to the characteristic system size. In
this article, the Debye length will be deﬁned by

where ǫs is the dielectric constant for the electrolyte and Co is the average concentration of neutral salt.
Alternative choices for the Debye length typically diﬀer from this deﬁnition by an O(1) multiplicative con-
stant.

6.1 Dilute Electrolytes

The free energy for general dilute electrolyte solutions is similar to the free energy for dilute neutral solutions:

In this expression, the ﬁrst term in the integrand is the entropic contribution from the solute particles, the
second term accounts for the interaction energy between the charged particles and the electric potential, and
the last term is the energy of the electric ﬁeld. Note that ǫ is deﬁned to be consistent with the deﬁnition in
(37).

Taking the functional derivative of the free energy with respect to ci, we ﬁnd that the electrochemical

potential of the i-th ionic species takes the simple form

Using (39) for the electrochemical potential, (35) reduces to the commonly used Nernst-Planck equations [30,
39]:

For the case of a symmetric, binary electrolyte, (41) leads to the commonly used Gouy-Chapman-Stern
(GCS) model for the double layer [30, 23, 31, 40]. It is well known that the GCS model can be theoretically
justiﬁed by noting that the double layer is always in quasi-equilibrium in the sharp interface limit [41].
However, the quasi-equilibrium structure of the double layer is not at all surprising in light of our discussion
in Section 4 – it follows directly from the fact that the electrical double layer is a sharp interfacial layer.

For symmetric, binary electrolytes, we can derive explicit expressions for the excess surface concentrations.

In this case, the excess concentration of each of the two ionic species is given by

+ + c∗

where c∗ = (c∗
−)/2 is the average concentration in the bulk and z+ is the charge number for the positive
ion. Following [42], this quantity is straightforward to integrate by changing the variable of integration in
(15) to ˆψ and using the fact that

expression for Γ± in (36), the surface conservation law for symmetric, binary electrolytes is fully speciﬁed
in terms of bulk ﬁeld variables and boundary conditions, and the structure of the boundary layer has been
completely integrated out.

Because the charge density and neutral salt concentration are both important components of the response
of an electrochemical system, it is interesting to derive surface conservation laws for these quantities [8, 42].
Toward this end, we deﬁne ǫq and ǫw to be the surface charge density and surface excess neutral salt
concentration, respectively7:

ǫq =

equations written in terms of these ﬁeld variables.

6.2 Concentrated Electrolytes

Following Iglic and Kralj-Iglic [43, 44] and Borukhov et al. [45, 46, 47], we can write a free energy that

(49)

As for concentrated neutral solutions, steric eﬀects are included by adding a contribution from the solvent
entropy (second term in integrand) and we have assumed that the molecules of all species present in the
system (including solvent molecules) are of the same size. It is important to mention that using (49) as the
free energy is only one way of including steric eﬀects. There are more sophisticated (and accurate) theories
involving statistical density functional theory [48, 49, 50, 51]. Unfortunately, these theories are generally more
cumbersome to analyze and often require advanced numerical methods in order to gain physical insight [52].

14

Next, we derive electrochemical potentials for the i-th ionic species following Kilic et al. [53] by taking

the functional derivative of the free energy with respect to the i-th concentration:

µi = log

+ ziφ.

Notice that, unlike dilute electrolytes, the transport of diﬀerent ionic species are directly coupled via the last
term in the ﬂux.

Following our previous procedure, we can derive the concentration proﬁle of each ionic species within the
double layer by using the fact that each of the µi must be constant in the normal direction. This observation
leads to a linear system of equations for the ionic concentrations, which is easily solved to yield

As for concentrated neutral solutions, the concentration proﬁles have a Fermi-Dirac-like form.

A little further progress can be made for the special case of symmetric, binary electrolytes. The excess

Unfortunately, integration of these excess concentrations for the concentrated electrolyte model does not
yield a particularly simple expression for the surface excess concentration [52]:

Combining this expression for the surface excess concentration and the electrochemical potential for concen-

6.3 Dominant Terms in Electrochemical Surface Conservation Laws

In general, the relative importance of the terms in a set of surface conservation laws (written in any form) may
depend on the choice of time scales and the magnitude of surface transport. In the context of electrochemical
transport, we ﬁnd that the boundary conditions applied in many theoretical studies are merely the leading

15

(50)

(51)

(52)

(53)

(54)

order form (in diﬀerent asymptotic and physical regimes) of the surface conservation laws derived in the
previous section. For instance, in induced charge electro-osmosis problems in dilute solutions at weak applied
electric ﬁelds [19, 20], ǫq and ǫw remains O(ǫ) quantities. Thus, compared to the normal ﬂux term, the
surface ﬂux term is negligible and the time-dependent term is only important at short times, t = O(ǫ). In
this situation, the double layer charging equation (47) becomes [20, 19]:

where σ = c∗ is the bulk conductivity of the solution and time has been rescaled using ˜t = t/ǫ so that the
dynamics are on the RC time scale [20, 8, 19]. At t = O(1) time scales, only the normal ﬂux remains an
O(1) quantity, so we are left with a “insulator” boundary condition for the electric potential:

∂q
∂˜t

= σ

∂φ
∂n

,

σ

∂φ
∂n

= 0.

(55)

(56)

At higher applied ﬁelds or for highly charged particles [4, 6, 7, 5], the dilute solution electrolyte model
leads to surface excess concentrations as large as O(1/ǫ) for some of the ionic species in the double layer. As
a result, surface currents becomes important and evolution of ionic concentrations within the double layer
occurs on an O(1) time scale. In this situation, no terms in (36) are negligible, so we must retain all terms
in (47) and (48).

7 Summary

In this article, we have presented a general formulation and derivation of surface conservation laws at
microscopically diﬀuse interfaces. Because surface conservation laws form the crucial connection between
bulk and interfacial dynamics, it is important to know that they are theoretically well-founded. Our work
ﬁlls this apparent void in the literature and provides a solid theoretical foundation based on techniques
from asymptotic analysis. Our analysis has also led to explicit formulae for the surface and normal ﬂuxes
involved in surface conservation laws.
In addition to formulae for arbitrary interfacial models, we have
presented a formulation of surface conservation laws for the important class of interfacial models derived
using the principles of non-equilibrium thermodynamics. This formulation provides a method for developing
interfacial models in a systematic and physically sound manner. Finally, we have demonstrated the derivation
of surface conservation laws in the speciﬁc contexts of diﬀusive and electrochemical transport. We emphasize,
however, that surface conservation laws are very general and apply to a wide-range transport processes. The
basic approach is to ﬁrst specify (or derive) a model for the interfacial layer and then to compute the surface
excess concentrations and surface ﬂux using the general formulae presented in this article.

Notes

1Note that diﬀerential operators will also need their units restored.
2cmax = 1/a3, where a3 is the characteristic volume of each solute/solvent particle.
3This assumption may be relaxed in situations where there are processes intrinsic to the interface (e.g., chemical reactions).
4In dimensional form, mobility coeﬃcients are related to diﬀusion coeﬃcients via the Einstein relation: Dij = kT Lij. With

our choice of energy scale, the dimensionless Einstein relation is Dij = Lij.

5This expression for the chemical potential implicitly assumes that the system is locally in thermal equilibrium. Given
this assumption, it is easy relate (25) to the deﬁnition from equilibrium thermodynamics by recognizing that the functional
derivative of the total free energy with respect to concentration is merely the partial derivative of the free energy density with
respect to concentration, which yields the local chemical potential of the system at each point in space.

6In dimensional form, Lij would be a scalar multiple of the identity matrix.
7The factor of 1/2 in the deﬁnition of q is present for mathematical convenience. The total surface charge density is 2ǫq.

Abstract

We present a detailed study of the eﬀects of the initial distribution on the kinetic evolution of the
irreversible reaction A + B → 0 in one dimension. Our analytic as well as numerical work is based on
a reaction-diﬀusion model of this reaction. We focus on the role of initial density ﬂuctuations in the
creation of the macroscopic patterns that lead to the well-known kinetic anomalies in this system. In
particular, we discuss the role of the long wavelength components of the initial ﬂuctuations in determining
the long-time behavior of the system. We note that the frequently studied random initial distribution is
but one of a variety of possible distributions leading to interesting anomalous behavior. Our discussion
includes an initial distribution with correlated A − B pairs and one in which the initial distribution forms
a fractal pattern. The former is an example of a distribution whose long wavelength components are
suppressed, while the latter exempliﬁes one whose long wavelength components are enhanced, relative to
those of the random distribution,

Introduction

Diﬀusion-limited reactions in low-dimensional geometries are well known to exhibit “anomalous” kinetics
diﬀerent from those predicted by the standard law of mass action [Ovchinnikov & Zeldovich, 1978; Toussaint
& Wilzcek, 1983; Kang & Redner, 1984; Kopelman, 1988; Burlatskii et al., 1989]. An example of anomalous
kinetics is exhibited by the diﬀusion-limited irreversible reaction A + B
0. If the distribution of each
reactant is spatially homogeneous, the rate laws for the global reactant densities ρA(t) and ρB(t) are ˙ρA =
ρ(0) then the densities
˙ρB =
Kρ2. In integrated
of the two species are equal at all times, ρA(t) = ρB(t)
form ρ−1(t) = ρ(0)−1 + Kt; at long times ρ
(Kt)−1. We call this behavior “classical.” However, the
actual asymptotic rate law in an inﬁnite volume in dimensions d < 4 for an initially random distribution of
Kρ(1+4/d) [Ovchinnikov & Zeldovich, 1978; Toussaint & Wilzcek, 1983; Kang &
reactants is instead ˙ρ =
Redner, 1984; Kopelman, 1988; Burlatskii et al., 1989]. The associated asymptotic time dependence of the
density is then ρ

The physical origin of the “anomalies” is in general clearly understood. The usual law of mass action
assumes a spatially homogeneous mixture of reactants; however, in low dimensions diﬀusion is not an eﬃcient
mixing mechanism and may be incapable of smoothing out reactant concentration ﬂuctuations that are
created, for example, by nonhomogeneous initial conditions, by external reactant sources if the system is
open, or by the reaction itself.

Consider the A + B

0 reaction starting from an initially random distribution of A and B. Such
a distribution exhibits local density ﬂuctuations, that is, certain regions of the system are relatively rich

in species A while others are relatively rich in species B. By “eﬃcient” mixing we mean mixing that is
rapid relative to the local reaction rate. Thus, if eﬃcient mixing (by whatever mechanism) occurs, such
local ﬂuctuations are rapidly suppressed. If mixing is not eﬃcient as, for example, in a diﬀusion-limited
reaction in low dimensions, then the reaction will cause the local minority species to be eliminated extremely
rapidly by the local majority species, and diﬀusion is not able to homogenize the system. There follows an
evolution of regions in which essentially only one or the other of the species is present, and any attempt of
the minority species to diﬀuse into this region leads to its rapid disappearance by reaction. The reaction then
only takes place at the interfaces of aggregates of diﬀerent species. As time proceeds (and the concentrations
of reactants decrease), the regions in space that are occupied by reactants of essentially only one species
grow in size, and the total interface area at which the reaction can occur decreases. This leads to ever more
eﬀective spatial segregation of the species and an associated slowing down of the reaction relative to its rate
in a homogeneous mixture. The system goes through a hierarchy of anomalous kinetic behaviors [Argyrakis
et al., 1993; Lindenberg et al., 1996] to arrive asymptotically at the so-called Zeldovich regime [Ovchinnikov
& Zeldovich, 1978; Burlatskii et al., 1989] characterized by the time dependence ρ

t−d/4 for d < 4.

This discussion punctuates three interesting features of these irreversible diﬀusion-limited reactions in
constrained (low dimensional) geometries. One is that the initial distribution determines the evolution of the
system for all time: the future of the reaction is imprinted in the spatial distribution at one given (“initial”)
moment. A second is the fact that it is necessary to start with disorder in order to produce an ordered state
at a later time: the formation of ever larger aggregates of a single species is a direct consequence of initial
ﬂuctuations that are not homogenized. A third is the realization that a random distribution is but one of
many possible initial distributions, and it is certainly not the most easily realized in practice. The historical
focus on the random distribution has perhaps obscured the fact that other initial distributions lead to other
t−d/4 in
behaviors, some “less anomalous” and others even “more anomalous” than the Zeldovich law ρ
their deviation from classical kinetics. It is this last point that we focus on in this paper.

∼

It is reasonable to expect that the suppression or enhancement of initial density ﬂuctuations will aﬀect
0 system. In particular, an
the kinetic progression and change even the asymptotic behavior of the A + B
initial distribution that is more homogeneous or mixed than a random one is expected to lead to behavior
closer to classical; conversely, an initial distribution in which ﬂuctuations are more prominent is expected
to lead to greater deviations from the law of mass action. Our work expands on previous concern with
this problem by a number of authors [Vitukhnovsky et al., 1988; Abramson et al., 1994; Abramson, 1995;
Lindenberg et al., 1994, 1996; Sancho et al., 1996].

A “mixing mechanism” that we must mention at the outset because it necessarily aﬀects the numerical
simulations that parallel our theoretical analysis (and because it occurs in physical systems) is provided
by the boundaries of a ﬁnite system of volume V = Ld, where L is the linear dimension of the system.
Regardless of the precise nature of the boundaries (reﬂective, periodic), segregation of species is in any case
limited by the ﬁnite size of the system. With periodic boundaries a reactant “perceives” this ﬁnite size at a
time [Lindenberg et al., 1996]

In Sec. 2 we summarize the model and our general theoretical framework. In Sec. 3 we study various
initial conditions and present for each case our theoretical and numerical results. A summary of conclusions
is presented in Sec. 4.

2 Theoretical Framework

We base our analysis on the reaction-diﬀusion equations utilized in many theoretical studies of this problem.
It is important to point out that our numerical results are also based on these same equations. This diﬀers

1The numerical factors in (1) arise from the ﬁrst non-zero eigenvalue of the diﬀusion equation. The time to cross a distance
L on average in a diﬀusion process would lead to the estimate tf ∼ L2/6D. In other words, this is only meant as an order-of-
magnitude estimate.

from the more usual, more microscopic, approach of simulating the system as a lattice gas in which the
reactants are random walkers and in which the reaction is an annihilation that occurs with certainty or with
some probability when reactants step on the same lattice site. Simulations at this level of detail require large
computer capabilities and long times to reach asymptotic behaviors [Argyrakis et al., 1993; Lindenberg et
al., 1994, 1996]. Reaction-diﬀusion equations represent mesoscopic approximations to this more microscopic
picture; such approximations can therefore only provide a theoretical backdrop over spatial and temporal
ranges that are not too detailed and for densities that are not too low. The results of direct numerical solution
of the reaction-diﬀusion equations are of course constrained in the same way as are the equations themselves.
On the other hand, such solutions, being more mesoscopic from the outset, require less computational
intensity and length to cover the hierarchies of behaviors and to achieve asymptotic behaviors. Although
this approach of course provides no information on the limits of validity of reaction-diﬀusion models, they
do provide a simpler and less costly backdrop against which to check the theoretical analysis of the model.
The reaction-diﬀusion equations for the local densities ρA(~x, t) and ρB(~x, t) of the two species are:

so that the densities of both species remain equal forever. D is the diﬀusion coeﬃcient, which we assume
to be the same for both species, K is the local reaction rate constant, and V is the system volume. Note
that we are using the same symbol, K, for the local rate coeﬃcient as we did for the global rate coeﬃcient.
When the global rate law is classical, the two are in fact the same; when it is not, the global rate is in
any case not quadratic in the global density and the “rate coeﬃcient” in a quadratic rate law is then not
even a constant. We vary the values of the parameters in our analysis, but recognize that (in appropriate
dimensionless units) a diﬀusion-limited reaction occurs if D/K

reaction requires K

reaction becomes reaction- rather than diﬀusion-limited

→ ∞

A few comments concerning notation are useful at this point. The local densities ρi(~x, t) evolve from
initial conﬁgurations ρi(~x, 0). In some cases these initial conﬁgurations are chosen from a distribution of
diﬀerent conﬁgurations (e.g., a random distribution) and it might be appropriate to perform an average
over the initial distribution [Lindenberg et al., 1996]. In other cases the initial conﬁguration may be a very
speciﬁc one, e.g. as in the study of the evolution of fronts [Koo & Kopelman, 1991]. We denote an average
of a quantity f (~x, t) over the initial distribution by a bracket:
. If we are dealing with a speciﬁc
f (~x, t)
i
initial conﬁguration then the initial distribution is a delta function and a quantity “averaged over the initial
distribution” is simply the same as the unaveraged quantity,

= f (~x, t).

h

Global quantities such as the global density are related to local ones by the volume average indicated in
Eq. (3). We also use a single bracket notation to denote an average over volume. The use of a single bracket
to denote one or the other or both averages should not create confusion since the context makes it clear
what averages have been taken. In any case, a dependence only on the time indicates that a volume average
has been performed, f (t) =

f (~x, t)
i
h

The ﬁrst impetus toward ﬁnding the global density from the reaction-diﬀusion equation might be to
average Eq. (2) over initial distribution and volume so as to obtain an equation for the rate of change of the
global density. However, this of course introduces a two-density average on the right hand side:

for the two-density product and again perform an average, which introduces a three-density term. In many
problems it is possible to truncate such a hierarchy and thereby close the set of equations. Such closure
is not possible here because it would miss the many-body nature of the problem:
indeed, the evolution
of macroscopic structures in these systems would seem to indicate that no “ﬁnite body approximation” is
appropriate, and that one needs to capture at least some aspects of the many-body eﬀects to all orders to
obtain a reasonable approximation.

h

We note that classical behavior is captured by Eq. (4) only if the average of the product can be broken
into the product of the averages,
. This separation is in general not correct and, in
ρBi
particular, not when there is species segregation. Indeed, if the species are strictly segregated then the right
hand side is zero because it is not possible to ﬁnd A and B at the same location, and thus the rate of change
of the global densities vanishes, as it should. If there is some species overlap, then the decay rate does not
vanish but is slow (slower than classical). If the species are randomly or homogeneously distributed, then
the average of the product does reduce to the product of the averages and the kinetics are classical, with a
consequent inverse time decay of the global densities.

A number of procedures have been introduced to deal with the many-body aspects of the problem
[Vitukhnovsky et al., 1988; Burlatskii et al., 1989].
In our analytic studies we follow [Vitukhnovsky et
al., 1988; [Lindenberg et al., 1988, 1990; Sokolov & Blumen, 1991; Sancho et al., 1996] by introducing the
diﬀerence and sum variables,

The diﬀerence variable γ(~x, t) captures the variations and ﬂuctuations in the spatial distribution of the
species. If the system is thoroughly mixed, this variable is everywhere small; if the species are segregated,
then the variable is positive in regions where A predominates and negative where B predominates; its
variability contains information on the sizes of such regions.
If the species were oppositely charged, for
example, then this variable would represent the local net charge. Fortunately, Eq. (6) is a simple linear
diﬀusion equation and can be solved exactly [Vitukhnovsky et al., 1988 Lindenberg et al., 1996] (and it is
through this exact solution that one captures important many-body eﬀects to all orders):

We return to the diﬀerence variable momentarily.

Consider next Eq. (7) for the sum variable. This variable is the density without consideration of species
identity, and it is in general expected to be a smoother function than the diﬀerence variable. Let us average
Eq. (7) over the volume and over the initial distribution of reactants:

The entire subsequent analysis of the kinetic behavior of the average global density ρ(t)
on this equation, and, in particular, on the behavior of the function

ρ(~x, t)

is based

(which one knows exactly), and on the relation between
and ρ(t). We shall call G(t) the segre-
gation function, since the diﬀerence variable (and consequently this function) vanishes for a homogeneous
distribution.

As we demonstrate explicitly below, the decay of G(t) with time (through diﬀusion) is not simply of a
ﬁxed inverse power form over the entire history of the process. Furthermore, in general there is no simple
relation that holds for the entire progression of the reaction between the average of the square of the local
density and the average density itself. Consequently, there is no exact kinetic description of the system
in terms of only the global density:
indeed, Eq. (11) is again but the ﬁrst member of an inﬁnite moment
hierarchy. Nevertheless, one attempts to extract a kinetic description from Eq. (11), at least approximately,
recognizing that in any case a single kinetic description does not hold for all times. It has therefore become
common practice to speak of kinetic behaviors that are valid over some substantial time range, and crossovers
from one type of behavior to another. If the “crossover” regimes are short compared to the regimes where one
type of behavior persists, one can then characterize the system in terms of a sequence of kinetic behaviors and
transitions between these behaviors. Such a description turns out to be possible in many cases. Toward this
purpose, in [Lindenberg et al., 1996] we presented an extensive discussion concerning the relation between
the average of the square of the density,

In any case, the balance of the three terms in Eq. (11) determines the behavior of the global density. A
general point that we return to subsequently in the context of particular cases can already be made here:
the presence of the “driver” G(t) =
causes deviations from classical behavior; as already mentioned,
a homogeneous distribution of reactants at time t is associated with a vanishing G(t) and with classical
kinetics.

G(t) is essentially determined by the behavior of the structure function for k < ka. In other words, the long-
time behavior of the segregation function deﬁned by the diﬀerence variable is dictated by the long-wavelength
components of the initial distribution (and also note that this behavior is entirely determined by diﬀusion
and is not inﬂuenced by the reaction). In this paper we consider a variety of initial conditions characterized
by diﬀerent forms of the structure function. Familiar cases include the random initial distribution in an
inﬁnite volume, for which S(~k) = const for k > 0, and a random initial distribution of A

Note that α may be positive or negative (or zero). If α is suﬃciently large (indicating a drastic cutoﬀ of
d, then G(t) decays more rapidly than t−2 and it
the long wavelength components), speciﬁcally if α > 4
rapidly ceases to play a role in the kinetics. The behavior then becomes classical [Vitukhnovsky et al., 1988;
Sancho et al., 1996]. Conversely, any initial distribution that emphasizes the long wavelength components
in the density diﬀerence leads to a slower decay of the “driver” (α < 0) and hence to greater deviations
from classical behavior. We present examples of both cases. Note that it would in any case at this point be
premature to conclude from Eq. (19) that ρ(t) decays as t−(α+d)/4 – at the very least, the moment relation
(14) must be established ﬁrst.

−

Ultimately we are constrained by the ﬁnite systems in which our numerical work is carried out; this
means that eventually G(t) vanishes exponentially, reﬂecting the fact that there are no contributions to it
whose wavelengths are longer than the size of the system.

The results of our analysis of the reaction-diﬀusion equations will be compared with the numerical
integration of Eq. (2). This integration is carried out by discretizing the volume V = L into N cells of
size ∆x (L = N ∆x) and time into intervals ∆t. The Laplace operator is represented in the standard
symmetrical form with respect to the mesh size ∆x, and the time integration follows a standard ﬁrst order
Euler algorithm. Note that adjustment of the discretization parameters ∆x and ∆t can alternatively be
accomplished by adjusting the parameters D, K, and N . We always set K
D in order to be in the
diﬀusion-limited regime for a meaningful interval of time, but otherwise set these parameters so as to be
able to clearly illustrate the behaviors under consideration. Throughout we set ∆x = 1, and ∆t = 0.01
except for early time calculations where on occasion we use smaller values of ∆t for the ﬁrst few hundred
integration steps. Initially an amount ρ0 of reactant A is placed in some cells and not in others, according to
N cells, then the

initial global density is ρinit = nρ0/N . Note that the maximum initial density possible is then ρmax = ρ0,
which occurs if every cell is initially occupied by both reactants. An average over diﬀerent initial conditions
is taken if necessary.

3 A Variety of Initial Conditions

The initial pattern of ﬂuctuations determines for all time the form of the driver G(t) in Eq. (11) with (12).
We establish below through speciﬁc examples that this driver decays more slowly (rapidly) when the long
wavelength components of the initial diﬀerence ﬂuctuations are enhanced (suppressed), and that the kinetics
of the A + B
0 reaction are more anomalous, i.e., further from classical behavior, when the driver decays
more slowly. When the decay of G(t) is more rapid than t−2 then its contribution becomes irrelevant and
the rate law approaches the classical form.

→

In this section we present the kinetic progressions for the A + B

0 reaction for a number of initial
conditions. The case of the random initial condition has been extensively studied in the literature and
is reviewed here in detail because it serves as a benchmark for the discussion of other initial conditions
[Argyrakis et al., 1993; Lindenberg et al., 1996]. This review allows us to establish some limitations imposed
by the reaction-diﬀusion approach [Lindenberg et al., 1996]. We then present an example of an initial
condition in which long wavelength components of the density diﬀerence ﬂuctuations are enhanced relative
to those of a random distribution. This initial condition, in the form of a fractal pattern, leads to more
pronounced deviations from classical behavior. We also present an example of an initial distribution whose
long wavelength components are more constrained than the random, namely, the case of correlated pairs
[Lindenberg et al., 1994, 1996, Sancho et al., 1996].

→

3.1 Random initial distribution

The random initial distribution of reactants has been the most thoroughly studied, even though it is diﬃcult
to implement in practice. Nevertheless, it is important because it is the distribution that was ﬁrst used
to quantify the fact that diﬀusion in low dimensions is not an eﬀective mixing mechanism.
It was the
distribution that clearly showed that initial (microscopic) ﬂuctuations are a necessary element to achieve
(macroscopic) segregated patterns, that is, that initial inhomogeneities, with no further explicit separating
mechanism or interactions other than the reaction itself, lead to macroscopic species segregation in low
dimensions [Ovchinnikov & Zeldovich, 1978; Toussaint & Wilzcek, 1983; Kang & Redner, 1984; Kopelman,
1988; Burlatskii et al., 1989].

We have argued elsewhere [Argyrakis et al., 1993; Lindenberg et al., 1996] that at extremely early times
the kinetics of the system is classical, that is, that with a random distribution of reactants the global density
Kρ2(t). We also noted that this behavior in low dimensions persists
obeys the classical rate law dρ(t)/dt =
only for a time of order K −1; on this time scale the distribution already begins to deviate from the random
distribution because of the reaction of physically contiguous A and B molecules. Because here we compare
our analytic results with those obtained numerically according to the discretization scheme described earlier,
we are constrained from consideration of initial concentration ﬂuctuations on a spatial scale smaller than ∆x.
In our discretized reaction-diﬀusion approach A and B densities that coexist within one cell are consumed
on the time scale K −1, and each cell is, after a time K −1, either empty or occupied essentially only by A or
only by B [Sancho et al., 1996].

−

Beyond this very early time behavior, the results that we detail below are captured in Fig. 1. We ﬁrst
describe the expected behavior and then compare it to that seen in the ﬁgure. As noted earlier, an initially
random distribution in an inﬁnite volume is characterized by the structure function S(~k) = const for k > 0.
In our discretized integrations over a ﬁnite volume, a random distribution is characterized by a constant
−1
structure function only in the range kL < k < k0, where k
0 = ∆x is the limit imposed by the discretization
and kL is the limit imposed by the ﬁnite system size. It follows from Eq. (16) that for times t > t0, where

the segregation function G(t) decays as t−d/2 [cf. Eq. (19)]; in fact, exact integration of Eq. (16) leads to
(we return to ﬁnite volume eﬀects in a moment)

where Q is a constant proportional to the initial density.

Figure 1: Decay of the global density in one dimension from an initially random distribution of reactants.

The consequent behavior of the global density predicted by Eq. (11) then depends on the relation between
the average of the square of the density and the global density itself. We have noted that for a random
distribution Eq. (13) holds. This relation is nearly satisﬁed for a nearly random distribution; that is, at
early times before the reactant distribution deviates too much from randomness the contribution linear in
the density dominates and the rate law is of the form

This decay is characteristic of the presence of a “depletion zone” around each reactant (and, for the same
reasons, is also characteristic for the A + A

Deviations from randomness and, in particular, spatial segregation of reactants, begin to set in very

behavior reﬂects the well-known segregation of the species – even as the densities decrease, the sizes of the

in this segregated regime indicates that the spatial distribution of the reactants within the single-species
aggregates is not random. If it were random, a relation such as (13) (with slightly modiﬁed coeﬃcients)

Figure 1 shows the evolution of the global density for a one-dimensional system with a random initial
distribution of cells containing A and a random initial distribution of cells containing B. We generate each of
these distributions separately but with the same number of occupied cells for each species, and then simply
superpose them. This produces some “premixed” cells whose density decays very rapidly [Sancho et al.,
1996]. Extensive premixing is avoided by starting with a relatively low initial density. We calculate the
resulting evolution for two diﬀerent values of the diﬀusion coeﬃcient. Figure 1(a) is for a larger diﬀusion
coeﬃcient than Fig. 1(b). In both, the Zeldovich decay regime is clearly seen over a considerable portion of
the ﬁgure – the numerical integration results run parallel to the t−1/4 lines. The earliest time depletion zone
behavior that precedes the Zeldovich regime, where ρ(t) is expected to decay as t−1/2, is more apparent in
the system with the smaller diﬀusion coeﬃcient. We have shown elsewhere that the transition from depletion
zone behavior, t−1/2, to Zeldovich behavior, t−1/4, occurs at a time ts inversely proportional to the diﬀusion
coeﬃcient. The rapid decrease in the density due to the onset of ﬁnite size eﬀects is clearly visible in both
cases. For the larger diﬀusion coeﬃcient (more rapid mixing) the onset of the classical regime is seen clearly,
as indicated by the fact that the density decay curve in (a) runs parallel to the t−1 line. The time of the run
in Fig. 1(b) is not suﬃciently long to see this classical regime clearly. Note that, as expected, the ﬁnite size
eﬀects set in later for the system with the smaller diﬀusion coeﬃcient.

density and also in the diﬀerence variable, while in a homogeneous distribution these ﬂuctuations have been
smoothed out – indeed, this is what is meant by “homogeneous.” For a random distribution the average
of the square of the diﬀerence variable is linear in the average density,
= ρmaxρ, and the average
of the square of the sum variable also has such a linear contribution, cf. Eq. (13) [Argyrakis et al., 1993;

3.2 A detour

The above description of the evolution of the reaction-diﬀusion system from an initial random distribution of
reactants predicts the behavior of the global density in various kinetic regimes, Eq. (23) followed by Eq. (25)

9

followed by Eq. (27), and in some cases predicts the approximate time around which a transition from one
kinetic behavior to another takes place. However, we are not easily able to predict the actual crossover
behavior itself. Thus, for example, we know when ﬁnite size eﬀects set in, and we can reason that the global
density will drop sharply around that time, but we have not predicted the functional form of the drop.

Some insights can be obtained by pausing at this point to analyze the behavior of the diﬀerent terms in
the reaction-diﬀusion equation itself in some detail. This “generic” examination will help us understand not
only the case of random initial conditions but also the behavior of the system with other initial conditions.

Figure 2: Decay of the global density in one dimension from point sources. N = 64, D = 2.0, K = 10, and
the initial source cells are separated by 31 empty cells. The straight line is t−1.

The analysis is facilitated by considering the evolution of the global density from the following initial
condition (more easily achievable than the random): A is initially placed in a single cell centered at xA and
nowhere else, and B is initially placed in a diﬀerent single cell centered at xB and nowhere else. In our
(one-dimensional) numerical implementation of a system with N = 64 cells we place these two cells as far
from one another as possible, i.e., there are 31 empty cells between the two initially occupied cells. The
resulting evolution is shown in Fig. 2. The global density essentially does not decay at all until A’s and B’s
on average encounter one another. In this numerical implementation the time for these encounters is roughly
the same as the time at which ﬁnite size eﬀects set in. There is an abrupt decrease in the density and the
system then settles into classical behavior, as indicated by the straight t−1 line. This system is fairly trivial
but oﬀers an opportunity to make a number of observations about the various terms in the reaction-diﬀusion
equation.

On the other hand, the global density is constant in this time regime, so that there is no simple moment
relation between
and the global density. The leading contributions of Eqs. (28) and (29) cancel as they
do in the random case, but the diﬀerence between them is now exponentially small. Here this in itself says
nothing about the decay of the global density, since this diﬀerence is not related in any simple way to the
global density. Information about the global density is obtained only when we explicitly balance ˙ρ(t) against
this very small diﬀerence.

(cid:11)

In our numerical example the time tm when reactants encounter one another on average is of the same
order as the time tf . At around this time the segregation function G(t) drops abruptly. So does the global
density, which then settles to the classical decay law (Kt)−1. When this happens, the segregation function
becomes irrelevant, the moment relation Eq. (14) becomes applicable as diﬀusion homogenizes the system,
and the principal balance in Eq. (11) is between ˙ρ(t) and the ﬁrst term on the right, that is, Eq. (11) reduces
to the classical rate law.

This description together with that of the random initial condition case permits us to reach some generic
conclusions about the behavior of the diﬀerent contributions to Eq. (11). Figure 3 is a schematic (not to
any particular scale) of the evolution of these diﬀerent contributions in low dimensions. First consider the
(solid curve). It typically begins by decaying according to a power law,
segregation function G(t) =
more slowly than t−2, with perhaps a transition from one slow power decay to another. At some time,
at the latest the time tf when ﬁnite system size eﬀects set in, the segregation function drops abruptly
(exponentially) as the system becomes homogenized. Next consider the average of the square of the density,
ρ2
(dashed curve). It is larger than the segregation function but decays to leading order in the same fashion
(cid:10)
before time tf . These two contributions are the leading terms in Eq. (11) and therefore balance one another.
The diﬀerence between them decays more rapidly than either term, so in this regime ˙ρ(t) (which balances
this diﬀerence and is sketched as a dot-dashed curve) decays rapidly as well and is negligible in the leading
balance. The square of the global density, ρ2(t), is also sketched (dotted curve). It is generally smaller than
the other two contributions, but approaches
(for diﬀerent reasons in diﬀerent cases). As it does so, the
G1/2(t), and this relation must of
global density itself is determined by the leading balance, that is, ρ(t)
course be consistent with the balance between ˙ρ and the diﬀerence between the leading terms. During the
crossover time when G(t) drops abruptly the system homogenizes, and ˙ρ catches up with ρ2, which by then
is essentially equal to

. G(t) then becomes irrelevant and the kinetics is classical.
(cid:11)
This generic sequence describes every initial condition that we have dealt with here and elsewhere [Ar-

slopes associated with a variety of anomalous kinetics (that is, decays of the global density that are slower
than the classical t−1) before ﬁnite size eﬀects set in. These anomalous kinetics arise from (indeed, require)
initial density ﬂuctuations and show a range of behavior depending on the distribution of these ﬂuctuations.
The random initial condition is but one example, and in one dimension is associated with decays of the global
density of the form t−1/2 followed by t−1/4. In the examples to follow we deal with the “more anomalous
case” of a fractal initial distribution leading to a slower decay than that of the random case, and with a “less
anomalous” case of initially correlated pairs leading to a decay closer to the classical.

3.3 Fractal initial distribution

Consider next an initial condition in which the long wavelength components of the diﬀerence variable are
emphasized relative to the random initial distribution, leading us to expect a greater deviation from classical
behavior [Provata et al., 1996].

Our initial distribution is generated as follows: the number N of cells in a row is chosen to be a power
of 3, N = 3n. We divide N by 3, thereby generating N/3 domains (each containing many cells). One of
the three domains, chosen at random from among the three, remains empty and is discarded from further
consideration. The other two domains are each subdivided into three subdomains, and one of each group
of three subdomains again remains empty and is set aside, while the other two are again subdivided. The
process continues in this way until the selected domains are as small as possible, that is, of size ∆x. An
initial density ρ0 of one of the reactants is placed in each of the selected elementary cells. The process is

12

this
repeated for the second reactant, and these two distributions are superimposed. In the limit N
leads to a fractal geometry of occupied cells of dimension Df = ln 2/ ln 3 = 0.63 [Vicsek, 1992]. The variable
γ is also characterized by the same initial fractal dimension, and the structure function for small k behaves
as a power law with an exponent given by the fractal dimension,

−Df

(30)

∼
Note that the exponent is negative, i.e., the long wavelength components are enhanced relative to those of a
random intitial distribution.

Consider now the sequence of behaviors that might be expected with this initial condition. Since there
may be some premixed cells, there will be a rapid decay of density in these cells on a time scale K −1. Once
this is over, we expect a lull in the activity since aside from the premixed cells, occupied cells are in general
quite separate. Indeed, if the fractal dimension is too high (e.g. if instead of subdividing into 3 parts at each
generation we subdivided into m portions with m fairly large) then there are many premixed cells and much
of the reactant disappears during the very early time regime. The quiescent period then dominates the time
evolution because there is little reactant left and it takes a very long time for reactants to ﬁnd one another
(somewhat like our point source example).

During the quiescent period the distribution is rather segregated but the sum variable is becoming
spatially homogenized through diﬀusion; hence one expects the moment relation (14) to apply. The diﬀerence
variable, on the other hand, is determined by the initial fractal pattern and leads to the segregation function
determined by Eq. (30). The rate is then of the form

For d = 1 (and, indeed, for d < 4 + Df ) the dominant terms are those on the right hand side, and the global
density thus decays as

Note that this decay is even slower than the Zeldovich behavior. This decay continues until ﬁnite size eﬀects
and the subsequent behavior described earlier take over.

In Fig. 4 we show the results of the numerical integration of the reaction-diﬀusion equations and the
prediction (32). It should also be noted that our initial patterns are not “ideal” fractals because we stop
the subdivision at a ﬁnite cell size. Our systems have N = 81, so we only go through four generations of
subdivisions. Nevertheless, the predicted results are clearly apparent in the ﬁgures. In Fig. 4(a) we see the
slow decay of the form t−0.092 expected for an initial distribution of fractal dimension Df = 0.63, followed by
the abrupt decrease in the global density associated with ﬁnite system size eﬀects and the eventual approach
to classical behavior. Figure 4(b) is for a smaller diﬀusion coeﬃcient – the slow decay continues for a longer
time, ﬁnite system size eﬀects set in later, and the time scale is not suﬃciently long to see the eventual
appearance of classical behavior.

3.4 Initially correlated pairs

−

A generic example of a constrained initial distribution of reactants in which the long wavelength components
of the initial density diﬀerence are diminished through built-in correlations is that in which randomly oriented
A
B pairs of particles separated by a ﬁxed distance c are initially distributed randomly in the system.
Subsequent to this initial constrained placement, each particle moves freely. Lindenberg et al. [Lindenberg
et al., 1994, 1996; Sancho et al., 1996] have studied in detail the kinetic progression for the A + B
0
reaction with this initial distribution. In our discretized reaction-diﬀusion picture we translate this into the
initial random placement of pairs of cells with centers separated by a distance λ (c = λ∆x), one cell of each
pair containing only species A and the other only species B (whether or not we allow initial occupancy of a
cell by diﬀerent species arising from diﬀerent pairs is immaterial - it only changes the very early transient,
as we have noted above).

In order to describe the ensuing kinetic regimes, we must distinguish two cases depending on the relation
between the time ts and the time tc. Recall from our discussion of the random initial condition that ts is the
crossover time at which the relation between the second and ﬁrst moment of an initially random distribution
ts then
changes from the form Eq. (13) to Eq. (14), that is, for the segregation process to begin. If tc ≤
segregation never sets in because initially correlated pairs of cells react (in a “burst”) before segregation
can begin. We have discussed this case in detail in [Lindenberg et al., 1994, 1996] and will not present this
particular case here. If tc > ts then up to time tc the system evolves as would a random distribution, with an
t−1/4 Zeldovich evolution during which segregated
early ρ
regions grow in size. These two regimes are described by Eqs. (22) and (24) respectively. However, at around
time tc the kinetic behavior changes because the second term in Eq. (33) becomes important: as t increases
well beyond tc, instead of Eq. (24) we now have for d < 2 a rate law of the form

We have explained the origin of this behavior (note that this decay, although anomalous, is faster than that
of an A + A reaction): the distance λ eﬀectively sets a limit on the sizes of the segregated aggregates. The
initial correlations in eﬀect homogenize the system by constraining the ﬂuctuations of wavelength greater
than λ. The relatively rapid decay Eq. (35) occurs because after time tc the single species aggregates actually
begin to shrink. It is this shrinkage that is reﬂected in the more rapid decay.

Eventually system size eﬀects enter the picture, Eq. (33) can no longer be used, and G(t) decays, as

always, exponentially. The kinetic evolution beyond this point is classical.

4 Conclusions

→

We have presented a study of the eﬀects of initial distributions on the behavior of the irreversible reaction
A+B
0 under stoichiometric conditions, mainly in one dimension (d = 1). Our work is based on a reaction-
diﬀusion model, and we include detailed discussions of the behavior of each term in the reaction-diﬀusion
equations. We have focused on the eﬀects of the initial pattern of ﬂuctuations of the density diﬀerence and
have stressed that this pattern determines the evolution of the system for all time. In particular, the long-
wavelength components of the initial diﬀerence distribution determine the asymptotic decay of the reactant
densities. Thus, this system constitutes a temporal “mirror” that for all time reﬂects the instantaneous
initial spatial pattern.

An initially random distribution of reactants leads to well-known and amply studied segregation of species
and the associated slowing of the reaction. In an inﬁnite system the asymptotic decay of the reactants in this
t−d/4 = t−1/4, which is distinctly diﬀerent from the classical
case is described by the “Zeldovich law” ρ
Initial distributions that limit the long wavelength components of
law-of-mass-action behavior ρ
the diﬀerence ﬂuctuations lead to constraints on the macroscopic segregation eﬀects and to rate laws closer
to the classical. We reviewed a particular example of such an initial distribution, namely, one containing
initially correlated A
B pairs. On the other hand, initial distributions that enhance the long wavelength
components lead to even greater deviations from the law of mass action. For instance, an initial fractal
diﬀerence pattern of dimension Df leads to the very slow decay ρ

t−(d−Df )/4.

−

We have emphasized the fact, also well known, that no single exponent characterizes the density decay
for all time, even in an inﬁnite system. Instead, we have indicated that it is often possible to characterize
the decay by a single exponent for a considerable length of time (compared to the other time scales in the
problem as determined by the reaction rate coeﬃcient and the diﬀusion coeﬃcient), followed by a crossover
of relatively short duration that leads to another exponent for a considerable time span, etc. The sort of
analysis presented here is only appropriate when these time scale separations are possible.

∼

Our numerical work is based on a direct integration of the reaction-diﬀusion equations and is, in all cases,
subject to the long wavelength constraints imposed by a ﬁnite system size. Thus, although the anomalous
decays indicated above might be expected to persist forever for irreversible diﬀusion-limited reactions in
inﬁnite systems, in the present work we do not emphasize the idealized asymptotic behavior. Instead, we
include a discussion of the behavior beyond the time tf at which ﬁnite system size eﬀects become apparent.
The reaction-diﬀusion model predicts classical behavior at long times. We should note that although in the
paper we discuss averages over initial distributions, the numerical results presented in our ﬁgures are all
for single realizations of these distributions. Further averaging over initial distributions did not modify the
outcomes.

It would be interesting to observe in detail not only the time evolution of the reactant densities but also
the spatial patterns associated with this evolution for the diﬀerent initial distributions that we have studied.
We plan to do so in the future.

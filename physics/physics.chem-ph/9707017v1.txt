Abstract

We consider the Langevin dynamics of a Gaussian test polymer chain

coupled with a surrounding matrix which can undergo the glass tran-

sition. The Martin-Siggia-Rose generating functional method and the

nonpertubative Hartree approximation are used to derive the general-

ized Rouse equation for the test chain. It is shown that the interaction

of the test chain with the surrounding matrix renormalizes the bare

friction and the spring constants of the test chain in such a way that

the memory function as well as the bending dependent elastic modulus

appear. We ﬁnd that below the glass transition temperature TG of the

matrix the Rouse modes of the test chain can be frozen and moreover

the freezing temperatures (or the ergodicity-nonergodicity transition

temperature) Tc(p) depends from the Rouse mode index p.

I. INTRODUCTION

It is wellknown that for relatively short polymer chains the standard Rouse

model can describe the dynamics of a melt reasonably well [1,2]. On the contrary,

for chain length N exceeding a critical length, the entanglement length Ne, the

behavior is usually described by the reptation model [1]. Here we restrict ourselves

to chain lengths N < Ne, i.e. the entangled polymer dynamics will be beyond of

our consideration.

The reason why in a dense melt the Rouse model provides so well dynamical

description for short chains is connected with a screening of the long-range hydro-

dynamic as well as the excluded volume interactions. As a result the ﬂuctuations

of the chain variables are Gaussian. But there are further essential questions: How

does the bare monomeric friction coeﬃcient ξ0 and the entropic elastic modulus ε

(which are simple input parameters of the standard Rouse model) change due to the

interactions of the test chain and the surrounding matix? Why does such a simple

model work so well for describing short chain melts? Obviously, the corresponding

answers cannot be given by the Rouse model, which describes only the dynamics of

connected Gaussian springs without further interactions.

On the other hand, at relatively low temperatures close to the glass transition

of the surrounding matrix the deviations from the standard Rouse behavior will

be deﬁnitely more pronounced. For example, Monte Carlo (MC) studies of the

bond ﬂuctuation model at low temperatures (but still above the temperature region

where possibly the glass transition mode coupling theory [3] applies) show that the

Rouse modes remain well-deﬁned eigenmodes of the polymer chains and the chains

2

retain their Gaussian properties [4]. Nevertheless, the relaxation of the Rouse modes

displays a stretched exponential behavior rather than a pure exponential. It could

even be expected that at temperatures below the glass transition temperature of

the matrix TG the Rouse modes are frozen out. In these temperature regimes the

interactions between monomers take a signiﬁcant role and determine the physical

picture of the dynamics as will be shown below.

The generalized Rouse equation (GRE), which can be used for the investigation

of the problems mentioned above, has been derived by using projection formalism

methods and mode coupling approximations (MCA) [5–7]. As a result of projection

operator formalism the time evolution of the test chain is expressed in terms of a

frequency matrix, which is local in time, and a memory function contribution due

to the inter-chain forces exerted on the test chain segments. With the assumption

that the frequency matrix term has the same form as in the standard Rouse model

(linear elasticity with the entropic modulus ε = 3kbT /l2) all inﬂuence of the matrix

chains reduce to the memory function contribution [5–7].

The projection operator methods appears to be exact but rather formal, and to

derive explicit results further approximations have to be made, which can be hardly

controlled often. Therefore it is instructive to use another alternative theoretical

method to derive the GRE. Recently, a non-pertubative variational method which is

equivalent to a selfconsistent Hartree approximation was used for the investigation

of the dynamics of manifolds [8] and sine-Gordon model [9] in a random media.

As a starting point the authors employed the standard Martin-Siggia-Rose (MSR)

functional integral technique [10,11]. Here we follow this approach to derive a GRE

and study the dynamics of a test polymer chain in a glass forming matrix.

3

The paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we give a general MSR-functional

integral formulation for a test chain in a polymer (or non-polymer) matrix. Under

the assumption that the ﬂuctuations of the test chain are Gaussian the Hartree-

type approximation is applied and a GRE is ﬁnally derived. The case when the

ﬂuctuation dissipation theorem (FDT) and the time homogenity are violated is also

shortly considered. In section 3 on the basis of the GRE some static and dynamical

properties of the test chain are discussed. In particular the theory of the test chain

ergodicity breaking (freezing) in a glassy matrix is formulated. Section 4 gives some

summary and general discussion. The appendices are devoted to some technical

details of the Hartree-type approximation.

II. GENERALIZED ROUSE EQUATION (GRE)

A. MSR-functional integral approach

Let us consider a polymer test chain with conﬁgurations characterized by the

vector function R(s, t) with s numerating the segments of the chain, 0 ≤ s ≤ N,

and time t. The test polymer chain moves in the melt of the other polymers (matrix)

which positions in space are speciﬁed by the vector functions r(p)(s, t), where the

index p = 1, 2, ..., M numerates the diﬀerent chains of the matrix. The test chain

is expected to have Gaussian statistics due to the screening of the self-interactions

in a melt [1]. We consider the simultaneous dynamical evolution of the R(s, t) and

r(p)(s, t) variables assuming that the interaction between matrix and test chain is

weak.

The Langevin equations for the full set of variables {R(s, t), r(1)(s, t), . . . , r(M )(s, t)}

In the spirit of the mode coupling approximation (MCA) [3,6] the force between

the test chain and the matrix should be expressed as a bilinear product of the two

subsystems densities. In order to assure this we expand the inﬂuence functional (8

the second order. This leads to

A1 [r, ˆr] of the matrix. In eq. (9) the term (t′ ⇔ t) is the same like the previous one

but with permutated time arguments. The terms which are linear with respect to Fj

vanishes because of the homogenity of the system. In the Appendix A we show that

because of causality the correlator hΠl(r, t)Πj(r′, t′)i1 equals zero [10–12]. Taking

this into account and performing the spatial Fourier transformation the expression

for GF (7) takes the form

of the matrix are naturally deﬁned. Going beyond the LRT-approximation would

bring us multi-point correlation and response functions.

We should stress that in contrast to the matrix with a quenched disorder which was

considered in [8,9] in our case the matrix has its own intrinsic dynamical evolution

which is considered as given. For example, for the glass forming matrix, which is

our prime interest here, the correlation and response functions are assumed to be

governed by the G¨otze mode-coupling equations [3].

B. The Hartree approximation

The Hartree approximation (which is actually equivalent to the Feynman varia-

tional principle) was recently used for the replica ﬁeld theory of random manifolds

[13] as well as for the dynamics of manifolds [8] and sine-Gordon model [9] in a

random media.

8

In the Hartree approximation the real MSR-action is replaced by a Gaussian

action in such a way that all terms which include more than two ﬁelds Rj(s, t) or/and

ˆRj(s, t) are written in all possible ways as products of pairs of Rj(s, t) or/and ˆRj(s, t),

coupled to selfconsistent averages of the remaining ﬁelds. As a result the Hartree-

action is a Gaussian functional with coeﬃcients, which could be represented in

terms of correlation and response functions. After these straightforward calculations

(details can be found in the Appendix B) the GF (12) takes the form

Hartree-type GF (15).

Up to now we considered the general oﬀ-equilibrium dynamics with the only restric-

tion of causality [10–12]. We now assume that for very large time moments t and

t′, where the diﬀerence t − t′ is ﬁnite so that t−t′

t → 0, time homogenity and the

ﬂuctuation-dissipation theorem (FDT) holds. This implies

As a result we have obtained basically the same GRE as in the papers [5–7] but

with one additional elastic term. This term (see the 2-nd term in eq. (27)) is mainly

inversely proportional to the temperature and is, in contrast to the ﬁrst term, of

an energetic nature. The two factors of kV (k) quantify the forces exerted by a

pair of surrounding segments on the test chain segments s and s′, whereas the

Sst(k) and Fst(k; s, s′) factors quantify the static correlations between the segments

of surrounding and test chain segments, respectively.

In [5–7] only the entropic

11

elastic part was taken into account. The memory function (26) has the same form

as in [5–7] and the relationship (28) is assured as soon as the FDT (22) and (23) is

fullﬁlled.

C. Generalized Rouse equations for the oﬀ-equilibrium dynamics

In this subsection we give GRE’s for the more general case when the time ho-

mogenity (stationarity) and the FDT do not hold [14].

By employing the standard way [8] one can derive two coupled equations of motion

for correlators C(s, s′; t, t′) and response functions G(s, s′; t, t′)

In the stationary case all correlators and response functions in eq. (29-32) only

depend from the diﬀerences of time moments, t − t′. If we assume again that FDT

(in the integrals over t

Of course, eq. (33) could be obtained immediately from eq. (25) by multiplying both

sides with Rj(s′, 0), averaging and taking into account that because of causality

hF (s, t)R(s′, 0)i = 0 at t > 0. We will use the GRE eq.(33), where the functions Γ

and Ω are given by eqs. (26, 27), in the next section for the investigation of the test

chain ergodicity breaking (freezing).

III. SOME STATICAL AND DYNAMICAL PROPERTIES OF THE TEST

CHAIN

The new features of the GRE (33) relative to the standard Rouse equation are

that it contains the integral convolution with respect to the s−variable in the fric-

tional term as well as in the elastic term. The frictional term is also non-local in

time. All these things together should change the statical and dynamical behaviour

of the Gaussian test chain in comparison to the ideal chain.

We also should stress that the GRE is substantially nonlinear because the memory

function (26) depends from the test chain correlator C(s, s′; t) in such a way that

a positive feedback obviously exists. That is the reason why one could expect that

eq. (33) shows an ergodicity breaking in the spirit of G¨otze’s glass transition theory

[3].

As usual it is convenient to introduce the standard Rouse mode variables [1]:

As a result all Rouse mode variables relax independently. The conclusion that the

Rouse modes are still ”good eigenmodes” even in the melt is supported by Monte-

Carlo [4] and molecular-dynamic [15] simulations.

For cases where the assumption of diagonality [38,39,40] cannot be justiﬁed, the

Rouse modes do not decouple and one have to go back to eq. (33). In the Rouse

A. Static properties

As we have already discussed in sec.II.B the interaction with the surrounding

segments renormalizes the elastic properties of the Rouse chain so that the test

chains elastic susceptibility is given by eq. (43). The additional elastic term in GRE

leads to the renormalized static normal modes correlator

Cst(p) =

T
2NΩ(p)

(49)

(50)

Explicit evaluation of the Ω(p) can be done if we use for the static correlator Fst(k; p)

and we have chosen l−1 as a cutting parameter. It is evident from the previous eqs.

(50a, 50b) that at small p

• the elastic modulus gains an energetic component which, in contrast to the

entropic part ε, increase with the cooling of the system,

• initially absolutely ﬂexible chains acquires a stiﬀness because of terms of order

p4 and higher.

16

At large p the elastic behaviour reduces to the standard Rouse one, as it is expected.

In Fig.1 is shown the result of a numerical calculation of the static correlator (49).

The Fourier component of the potential is taken, as it is customary e.g.

in the

theory of neutron scattering [16], in the form of a pseudo potential approximation,

V (k) = γσ3, where γ and σ have dimensions of molecular energy and distance,

respectively. The static structure factor Sst(k) is chosen in the form of the Percus-

Yevick’s simple liquid model [17]. One can see that for N = 500 the small Rouse

mode index limit (50a) starts at p

N ≤ 3 · 10−3 whereas the opposit limit (50b) is

fullﬁlled at p

N ≥ 10−1. Because the correlator Cst(p) depends mainly from p/N,

for relatively short test chains the high mode index limit (50b) is shifted into the

window of calculations (see Fig.1 for N=20).

At least qualitatively this deviation from the standard Rouse behaviour have been

seen by Kremer and Grest in their MD-simulations (see Fig.3 in [15]).

B. The test chain ergodicity breaking in a glass forming

matrix

First we consider the case p 6= 0.

In the nonergodic state the Rouse mode

correlation functions can be represented as

Ψ(p, t) ≡

= Ψreg(p, t) + g(p)

(53)

C(p, t)
Cst(p)

where the non-ergodicity parameter

g(p) ≡ lim
t→∞

Ψ(p, t)

(54)

was introduced and Ψreg(p, t → ∞) = 0.

17

For the correlation function of the glassy matrix we can use the standard result

of the glass transition theory [3]

φ(k, t) ≡

= f c(k) + h(k)∆1/2

(55)

S(k, t)
Sst(k)

a

τ∆
t (cid:19)

(cid:18)

where the proximity parameter ∆ ≡ (TG − T )/TG is deﬁned and TG is the temper-

ature of the matrix ergodicity breaking (G¨otze temperature). In eq. (55) f c(k) is

the non-ergodicity parameter of the matrix, τ∆ ∝ ∆−1/2a is the characteristic time

scale, a is the characteristic exponent, 0 < a < 1/2 and h(k) is some amplitude.

In order to derive the equation for g(p) let us take the limit t → ∞ in eq. (41)

keeping in mind the deﬁnitions (54) and (55). Very close to the test chain ergodicity

breaking temperature Tc(p), g(p) goes to zero (A-type transition [3]) and we can

expand the exponential function in eq. (42) up to the ﬁrst order with respect to

g(p). The solution of the resulting equation has the simple form

g(p) = 1 −

6Ω(p)2
d3k
(2π)3 k4|V (k)|2Sst(k)f c(k)

The critical temperature Tc(p) is determined by the equation

R

The numerical solution of eq. (57) is given in Fig.2.

It is obviously that if the

entropic part of Ω(p) dominates, the critical temperature is given by

g(p, T = Tc) = 0

Tc(p) ∝

2

.

N
πp !

 

Fig.2 really shows that this law (58) is well satisﬁed due to the fact that the critical

temperatures Tc(p) are quite high. But for low temperatures the energetic con-

tribution in Ω(p) is enhanced which leads to a deviation from this simple (N/p)2-

dependence.

Now we consider the case for p = 0. The equation (45) for the velocity of the center

Fig.3 shows the results of numerical calculations of Tc(p = 0) and Tc(p = 1) as

functions of N. One can see that in the reasonable range of parameters Tc(p = 0) >

Tc(p = 1). As a result one can say that on cooling of a test chain in a glassy matrix

the mode p = 0 is the ﬁrst to be freezed. On the subsequent cooling the modes

p = 1, 2, . . . , N are freezed successively,

TG > Tc(p = 0) > Tc(p = 1) > Tc(p = 2) > . . . Tc(p = N).

(73)

It is apparent that the system studied here is a nontrivial polymeric generalization

of the model introduced by Sj¨ogren [20]. This model was used for the investigation

of the β-peak in the spectrum of glass forming systems [21].

IV. DISCUSSION

In this paper we have derived a GRE for a test polymer chain in a polymer (or

non-polymer) matrix which has its own intrinsic dynamics, e.g. the glassy dynam-

ics [3]. We have used here the MSR-functional integral technique which could be

considered as an alternative to the projection operator formalism [6]. One of the

diﬃculties in this formalism is the necessity of dealing with the projected dynamic,

which is diﬃcult to handle with explicitly. On the contrary in MSR-technique the

dynamic of slow variables is well deﬁned and several approximations which one have

to employ could be justiﬁed.

In the interaction of the test chain with the surrounding matrix only two-point

correlation and response functions are involved.

In terms of MCA [6] this obvi-

ously corresponds to the projection of the generalized forces only onto the bilinear

variables: product of test chain density and matrix density.

21

To handle with the action in the GF of the test chain we used the Hartree-type

approximation (i.e., equivalent to the Feynman variational principle) [8,9,13], which

is reasonable when the ﬂuctuations of the test chain are Gaussian. In the case of a

polymer melt (high densitiy) this is indeed the case due to the screening eﬀects for

the excluded volume [1].

The use of the Hartree-type makes the problem that we deal with analytically

amenable and results in the GRE’s for the case when the FDT holds as well as for

the case when FDT does not hold. In this paper we have restricted ourselves to the

ﬁrst case and have shown that the interaction with the matrix renormalizes not only

the friction coeﬃcient (which makes the chain non-Markovian) but also the elastic

modulus (which changes the static correlator). The form of the static correlator for

the Rouse mode variables is qualitatively supported by MD-simulations [15].

As regards the dynamical behaviour, we have shown that the test chain in a glassy

matrix (with the matrix glass transition temperature TG) undergoes the ergodicity

breaking transition at a temperature Tc(p) ≤ TG. The critical temperature Tc(p)

could be parametrized with the Rouse mode index p and is a decreasing function of

p.

We have considered only the A-type transition which is assured by the bilinear

term in the expansion of eq. (42).

It seems reasonable that keeping the whole

exponential function in eq. (42) might lead to a B-type transition also. The results

also essentially would change if the oﬀ-diagonal elements in the matrix (36) can not

be neglected (see eq. (48)). In this case only one ideal transition temperature Tc

would be possible. The general theory of a A-type transition was discussed in [23].

This picture of freezing here should not be mixed with a diﬀerent one, the un-

22

derlying glass transition by itself (e.g. the glass transition of the matrix at T = TG).

According to the present view of this phenomenon [3], the spontaneous arrest of the

density ﬂuctuations is driven by those of the microscopic lengthscale k0, where k0

is the wave vector which corresponds to the structure factor’s main maximum. The

freezing of these ﬂuctuations then arrests the others through the mode coupling.

Such multi-point cumulant response functions (MRF) were considered in [12]. The

causality condition for these functions asserts that the time argument of at least one

r-variable should be the latest one, otherwise this MRF equals zero. Because of the

23

same reason self-loops of response functions vanish [10,11]. MRF’s which consists

only of ˆr-variables also vanish.

In the case (A1) all time arguments of the r-variables are equal to the corresponding

time arguments of ˆr-variables and as a result the MRF in eq. (A1) vanishes.

where the last equation comes from the fact that the response function G(t, t′) ∝

Θ(t − t′) and G(t′, t) ∝ Θ(t′ − t).

The 3-rd term in the exponent eq. (12) can be handled in the same way. The

response function for the isotropic matrix has the form

Pj(k, t) = −

where P (k, t) is the longitudinal part of the matrix response function. Then the

Hartree approximation of the 3-rd term in the exponent (12) takes the form

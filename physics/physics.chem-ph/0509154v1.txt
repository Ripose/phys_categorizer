Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) and Surface-Enhanced Fluorescence (SEF) are stud-
ied within the framework of modiﬁed Spontaneous Emission (SE), and similarities and diﬀerences
are highlighted. This description sheds new light into several aspects of the SERS electromagnetic
enhancement. In addition, combined with the optical reciprocity theorem it also provides a rigorous
justiﬁcation of a generalized version of the widely used SERS enhancement factor proportional to
the fourth power of the ﬁeld (|E|4). We show, in addition, that this approach also applies to the
calculation of Surface-Enhanced Fluorescence cross-sections thus presenting both phenomena SERS
and SEF within a uniﬁed framework.

INTRODUCTION

The emission properties of a dipole are aﬀected by its
environment. This fact was ﬁrst pointed out by Purcell
[1] and has since then been demonstrated experimentally
in a wide range of experimental situations; for example
for excited Eu3+ ions in front of a plane metallic surface,
as in the original observation by Drexhage [2], or for Ryd-
berg atoms in an optical cavity [3]. This eﬀect can be par-
ticularly strong in close proximity of metallic structures
[4, 5, 6]. It is evident in the modiﬁcation (quenching or
enhancement) of spontaneous emission (SE) rates [7]. Al-
though this eﬀect has been assumed for some time to lead
to a strong quenching of the ﬂuorescence, instances of en-
hanced ﬂuorescence have been reported more recently for
dyes [8], and even for quantum dots [9], so-called Surface-
Enhanced Fluorescence (SEF) or Metal-Enhanced Fluo-
rescence (MEF). Such enhancements have been known
for some time and are even more spectacular in Sur-
face Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) [10]. SERS
has regained interest lately following the observation of
single molecules [11, 12], and possible applications in bi-
ology/analytical chemistry [13, 14] and nano-plasmonics
[15]. SERS enhancement factors as large as 1015 have
been reported and are believed to be mainly electromag-
netic (EM) in origin, although the detailed mechanism is
still debated. It is widely accepted that localized surface
plasmon resonances give rise to places with large local
ﬁeld enhancement factors |ELoc/E0|; so-called hot-spots.
In most cases the SERS signal is assumed to be propor-
tional to the power of 4 of this factor [14, 16, 17]: a power
of two accounting for the excitation part, and a power of

two for the emission. This assumption, although widely
used in particular to explain the enhancements required
for single molecule SERS, has never been rigourously jus-
tiﬁed, as we shall show in the forthcoming discussion.

Numerous theoretical studies have concentrated on the
modiﬁcation of SE rates inside dielectric materials, per-
fect or absorbing, and close to boundaries with dielectrics
or metals. Optical cavities, and similarly photonic crys-
tals, can also strongly enhance, suppress, or redirect the
SE ﬁeld of an atom [3]. Most available results in the lit-
erature relate to SE rates in simple geometries such as
plane boundaries, spheres, or ellipsoids. Only recently,
methods have been proposed for SE rates in more com-
plex nano-structures [18]. Scattering processes (elastic or
inelastic) by an atom are in many ways similar to spon-
taneous emission. Excluding stimulated processes, the
scattering of a photon by an atom involves the ‘sponta-
neous’ creation of a photon in a mode where no photon
existed before. One therefore expects a modiﬁcation of
the scattering cross-section in a similar way as SE rates
are modiﬁed by the environment. The diﬀerence between
these two processes only lies in the initial state, to wit:
excited atom with no photon for SE, or atom in ground
state with one incident photon for the case of scattering.
Fluorescence is also in many respects similar to scatter-
ing. The crucial diﬀerence is that scattering is instanta-
neous while ﬂuorescence is a stepwise process involving
absorption, energy relaxation, and spontaneous emission.
It is one of the purposes of this paper to highlight the
similarities, and discuss the diﬀerences between SE, SEF,
and SERS for atoms or molecules in close proximity of
metal surfaces. These aspects have been discussed in re-
views, in the past [4, 5, 6] and more recently [8], but usu-
ally focusing on one speciﬁc process. The emphasis will
be put, therefore, on the relationships between these pro-
cesses presenting them under one single framework in a
more modern context. In particular, the various methods
for calculating SE rates and cross sections, some of them

common and others more novel, are described in detail.
The description is kept as simple as possible to empha-
size the physical aspects. For this reason, we constrain
our description to classical electrodynamics with a local
dielectric function. We also use isotropic polarizabilities
whenever necessary to avoid complicated tensorial nota-
tions. The results are illustrated by simple examples of
emitters close to a silver sphere. The main advantage is
that it does not rely on any approximation for the so-
lution of the electromagnetic problem, since analytic ex-
pressions (not discussed here) can be obtained from Mie
theory [19]. These choices do not aﬀect the generality of
the results and the methods described here can be used
for complex geometries provided that a suitable method
–usually numerical– is available to solve the electromag-
netic problem.

Finally, particular emphasis will also be given to the
EM enhancements in SERS. We derive a general for-
mula for the SERS cross sections in the framework of
modiﬁed SE rates. It highlights the importance of non-
radiative vs.
radiative enhancements and also empha-
sizes the strong similarities between SERS enhancement
and enhanced SE which, by the same token, requires to
reconsider the origin of the ﬂuorescence quenching un-
der SERS conditions. In addition, the optical reciprocity
theorem [20] is used to show that these results are con-
sistent with a generalized version of the commonly used
|E|4 factor in SERS, with certain (generally overlooked)
limitations.

The paper is organized as follows: in Sec. II, we discuss
modiﬁed SE rates and the various ways of calculating
them. In particular, we highlight the use of the optical
reciprocity theorem as a method for calculating SE rates,
a technique that has not received the attention it should
deserve. The modiﬁcation of the quantum yield of a ﬂu-
orophore is also discussed. In Sec. III, we apply these ar-
guments to the determination of SERS cross-section. We
use the reciprocity theorem to derive a generalized ver-
sion of the common |E|4 enhancement factor, and show
a simple example where this factor would lead to erro-
neous results. Similar arguments are applied to obtain a
simple description of SEF. It is shown that ﬂuorescence
quenching or enhancement are usually both possible, de-
pending on the relative contribution of two competing
mechanisms, namely: absorption cross-section enhance-
ment and non-radiative quenching. Finally in Sec. IV,
we discuss the diﬀerences and similarities between SE
rates and SERS cross sections. Some common aspects
of SERS, such as ﬂuorescence quenching or the presence
of an inelastic continuum, and other outstanding issues
(such as vibrational pumping) are revisited within this
new approach.

II. MODIFIED SPONTANEOUS EMISSION

Spontaneous emission is an intrinsically quantum ef-
fect, where a dipolar atomic transition couples to the

2

vacuum state of the electromagnetic ﬁeld. This coupling
can only occur with the quantized electromagnetic ﬁeld,
where the vacuum state has a zero-point energy and ex-
hibit quantum ﬂuctuations. However, because of the dif-
ﬁculties in the quantization of the ﬁeld in complex struc-
tures, the modiﬁcation of SE rates is most often studied
within a semi-classical model of an oscillating electro-
magnetic dipole [4]. This leads to results in agreement
(in most cases) with experiments and with the full quan-
tum mechanical treatment when possible. Several com-
plementary techniques can also be used; the ﬁrst of which
considers the self-reaction ﬁeld and is closest to the quan-
tum treatment (and can be shown to be formally equiv-
alent in most cases). The latter enables the derivation
of a decay rate but does not distinguish between radia-
tive and non-radiative processes. To avoid this problem,
one can use a second technique based on the Poynting
vector, which emphasizes energy conservation. We re-
view here the derivation and main results of these two
methods. We then describe a third approach, which has
hardly been used in the past, but will be important in
connection with the SERS cross sections.

SI units are used throughout the paper. Results from
these three approaches are illustrated by considering a
dipolar emitter at a short distance d = 1 or 2 nm from
the surface of a silver sphere.
Standard Mie theory
[19, 21, 22] was used to derive these results, and the
environment is assumed to be vaccuum (ǫr = 1). The
(local) wavelength-dependent relative dielectric function
of silver was approximated by:

ǫ(λ) = ǫ∞ −

where ǫ∞ = 4, λp = 141 nm, Γ = 17000 nm. These
parameters provide the best Drude ﬁt for the real optical
properties of Ag.

A. Spontaneous Emission and self-reaction

Within the classical treatment, SE can be seen as an ef-
fect of the self-reaction, i.e. the electromagnetic ﬁeld ESR
created at the dipole position by itself, either directly or
through its interaction with the environment (reﬂected
ﬁeld). We consider a dipole d = ded, oscillating at a fre-
quency ω (an e−iωt dependence is assumed for the ﬁelds).
The self-reaction ﬁeld can be written as ESR = G(ω)d,
where G(ω) can be viewed as the self-reaction Green’s
tensor, obtained by solving Maxwell’s equation with the
appropriate boundary conditions.

The SE rate can then be calculated from [18, 23]

Γ =

d2Im(edG(ω)ed),

which can be derived from quantum arguments [23]. The
parameter d should be taken to be the dipole moment
qu = |−e hb| r · ed |ai|2 between excited
of the transition d2

(|bi) and ground state (|ai). However, Γ can be evaluated
using Eq. 2 from the classical calculation of the Green’s
tensor [23]. For example, for an atom in free space, it
can be shown [24] that G0(ω) = G0(ω)1, with

which leads to the usual spontaneous emission lifetime:

Im(G0(ω)) =

ω3
6πǫ0c3 ,

Γ0 =

ω3
0d2
qu
3πǫ0¯hc3 .

(3)

(4)

The reason why the classical self-reaction Green’s tensor
G(ω) can be used to determine Γ is that it is intricately
linked to the vacuum ﬂuctuations through the quantum
ﬂuctuation-dissipation theorem [23].

In the presence of boundaries, in particular close to
metallic surfaces, the self-reaction ﬁeld and therefore the
SE rate can be strongly modiﬁed. One can then write
G = G0 + Gr, where Gr corresponds to the self-reaction
due to the ﬁeld reﬂected by the boundaries at the dipole
position. This can be calculated by solving Maxwell’s
equation for the dipole emission in the presence of bound-
aries. The SE rate enhancement factor is then derived
from Eq. (2) and reads

MTot(ω) =

= 1 +

Γ
Γ0

Im(edGr(ω)ed)
Im(G0(ω))

,

(5)

where Im(G0(ω)) is given by Eq. (3).

It is important to stress that MTot here corresponds
to the modiﬁcation of the total decay rate of the emitter.
MTot can also be rewritten as PTot/P0, where P0 is the
power emitted in free space, and PTot is the total power
extracted from the dipole in the presence of the metal. In
most situations, especially with metals, only a fraction,
PRad, of this power is radiated in the far-ﬁeld, while the
remainder, PNR, is absorbed by the environment. In most
measurements, only the radiative enhancement is mea-
sured: PRad/P0. However, the emitter does experience a
total decay rate enhancement given by MTot. This can
in principle only be observed directly in a time-resolved
experiment [7]. Moreover, a large value of MTot does not
necessarily imply a large radiative enhancement, in par-
ticular in the presence of absorbing media such as metals
[7, 18, 23]. The main inconvenience of the approach de-
scribed above is therefore that it does not lead to any
information about the radiative properties.

B. The Poynting vector approach

Another possible semi-classical approach is to directly
calculate the power PTot extracted from a classical dipole
dcl and deduce

MTot(ω) =

PTot(ω)
P0(ω)

The surfaces CTot and CRad are used to evaluate PTot and
PRad within the Poynting vector approach. In the top-right
corner we depict the radiation ﬁeld and its components, which
will play a role for the formulation of the optical reciprocity
theorem. See the text for further details.

cl/(12πǫ0c3) is known from classical

electrodynamics [25]. PTot can be estimated by solv-
ing Maxwell’s equations for the dipole in the presence
of the boundaries and then integrating the ﬂux of the
Poynting vector, S, through a closed surface outside the
dipolar source [4, 18, 22]. Let us consider a dipolar emit-
ter (in vacuum) located close (but not inside) to one or
several ﬁnite size metallic objects. The situation is de-
picted schematically in Fig. 1. We can draw a surface
around the emitter, CTot, small enough to enclose no
absorbing media, and calculate the ﬂux of the Poynting
vector, PTot, through this surface. Because of energy con-
servation (no absorption inside this surface), PTot must
be equal to the power extracted from the dipole by the
EM ﬁeld PTot = −0.5 × Re(iωd∗ · E). From this ex-
pression and using the deﬁnition of G and the value for
P0, one sees that Eq.
(6) is exactly equivalent to Eq.
(5) obtained from the self-reaction approach. The two
approaches are therefore fully consistent owing to energy
conservation (when the dipole is assumed to be located in
a non-absorbing medium). Note that the self-reaction ap-
proach, thanks to its direct link with the quantum treat-

ment, can be used to calculate the absolute decay rate,
Γ or Γ0, as in Eq. (4). The Poynting vector approach,
however, only yields the relative decay rate (enhancement
factor), Γ/Γ0. This is not a limitation here, since we are
interested precisely in this decay rate enhancement.

Besides, the Poynting vector approach also yields ad-
ditional information, namely: the non-radiative decay,
the radiated power, and its angular dependence (radia-
tion pattern) [4, 18]. In the situation of Fig. 1, where
the dipole environment is bounded, one can enclose the
emitter and all absorbing media in a large sphere, CRad,
and calculate the power outﬂow on this surface, which
corresponds to the power radiated by the source in the
far-ﬁeld, PRad. Moreover, if this surface is suﬃciently
far from any objects and sources, such that the lines
of the Poynting vector are approximately radial (radi-
ation ﬁeld), then one can also obtain dPrad/dΩ(θ, φ) =
r2Re(S · er), i.e the power radiated per unit solid angle,
and deduce the angular radiation pattern. Finally, from
the solution of the EM ﬁeld inside the absorbing media,
it is also possible to calculate the total absorbed power,
PNR, which corresponds to non-radiative losses. Alter-
natively, one can also use energy conservation, which en-
sures that PTot = PRad + PNR, to obtain the absorbed
power from the other two magnitudes.

This technique therefore enables us to calculate the
radiative enhancement MRad = PRad/P0, and the radia-
tive eﬃciency ηRad = PRad/PTot. These two quantities
can also be deﬁned and calculated as a function of angle
(θ, φ). It is interesting to note that a large radiative en-
hancement can coexist with a small radiative eﬃciency,
and vice-versa, depending on the weight of non-radiative
processes. What is measured in experiments is usually
either the radiative SE enhancement MRad, or the angle
dependent radiative enhancement MRad(θ, φ). The to-
tal SE rate enhancement or decay rate MTot (radiative+
non-radiative) can only be measured in time-resolved ex-
periments.

C. Some simple examples

The problem of an emitter close to a metal sur-
face has been studied extensively in the simple case
of a plane surface with various degrees of reﬁnement
[4, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30]. Few studies have, however, fo-
cused on the regime of small distances between emitter
and metal (a few nanometers). In principle, the non-local
description of the dielectric function fails at such small
distances. However, because of the diﬃculties of solving
the non-local EM problem in complex structures, it is
useful to consider the local problem to obtain qualitative
and semi-quantitative results. Close to a plane, MTot
can be very large, for example of the order of 106 at the
Surface Plasmon (SP) resonance (Re(ǫr) ≈ −1) of no-
ble metals. However, the radiative enhancement is then
(at best) of order∼1, sometimes much smaller. Most of
the energy is therefore emitted into non-radiative modes,

trates the inﬂuence of surface plasmon resonances. The peak
in MRad red-shifts with increasing a and corresponds to the
surface plasmon resonance of the sphere, which is geometry-
dependent. Note also that enhancements are larger at reso-
nance for the smallest spheres. The peak in MTot does not
change with a and remains at 315 nm. This corresponds to
the condition Re(ǫ) ≈ −1 and is the intrinsic surface plas-
mon resonance of a plane silver surface. As can be seen in
the plots, this resonance is strongly non-radiative, while the
sphere resonance is radiative in essence.

and is eventually dissipated in the metal. These modes
have been shown to correspond to non-radiative Surface
Plasmon Waves (SPW). Although this identiﬁcation re-
quires a non-local treatment, the study of the relative
contribution of radiative vs non-radiative decays is al-
ready contained in the local approximation; this is pre-
cisely what is important for the study of processes such
as SE, SEF, and SERS. These studies on plane metallic
surfaces are the origin of the common belief that ﬂuores-
cence is always quenched close to metals. We will show
here that more complex metallic structures, in particu-
lar nano-particles, can lead to enhancements with a large
radiative component.

To understand this, we show in Fig. 2 the wavelength
dependence of MTot and MRad for a dipole perpendicu-
lar to the surface of a silver (Ag) sphere. The results are
shown for three sizes of spheres with radii a = 15, 25,
and 40 nm, respectively; typical for colloidal Ag. Vary-
ing the radius enables to understand the role of the main
dipolar surface plasmon resonance of the sphere, which
red-shifts from about 350 to 380 nm as the size increases.
MRad clearly exhibits maxima at the SP resonances. On

the opposite, MTot remains virtually unchanged for all
sizes, peaking at 315 nm (Re(ǫr) ≈ −1), corresponding
to the intrinsic SP resonance of a plane Ag surface. This
can be understood simply: the sphere SP resonance is
radiative, and leads to a larger MRad when the dipole
couples to it eﬃciently. This resonance is strongly geom-
etry dependent, and is red-shifted for larger objects, or
for coupled objects such as two closely-spaced spheres.
However, the intrinsic Ag SP resonance at 315 nm is al-
ways strongly non-radiative. It is related to the strong
reﬂected ﬁeld created by the dipole image. This is inde-
pendent of geometry because the surface is approximately
a plane when viewed from the dipole at very short dis-
tances. The intensity of the reﬂected ﬁeld is however
strongly dependent on the distance d of the dipole from
the surface, and decreases as d−3. This interpretation
is further conﬁrmed in Fig. 3 where the results for two
distances, d = 1 and 2 nm, are compared. The expected
dependence of MTot with distance is clearly observed,
while MRad remains virtually unchanged. This reﬂects
the fact that MTot is dominated by the dipole image re-
ﬂected ﬁeld (strongly distance dependent), while MRad
depends primarily on how well the dipole emission cou-
ples to the radiative SP resonance of the sphere. This
coupling is not strongly sensitive to distance, but should
however be sensitive to the dipole orientation. This is
also illustrated in Fig. 3 where perpendicular and paral-
lel dipoles are compared.

Finally, we can also identify from Figs. 2 and 3 the sit-
uations where the radiative enhancement is the largest.
First, dipoles perpendicular to the surface present larger
enhancements than those parallel to it. Moreover, as
already pointed out, MRad is maximum at the SP res-
onance of the sphere, which is size-dependent. At this
maximum, MRad is largest for the smallest sphere, with
values of ≈ 1100 for a = 15 nm, down to ≈ 470 for
a = 25 nm and ≈ 120 for a = 40 nm. For a given radius,
MRad varies little with d, down to ≈ 380 for d = 2 nm,
or ≈ 210 for d = 5 nm (for a = 25 nm). However, be-
cause MTot decreases strongly, the radiative eﬃciency
ηRad = MRad/MTot increases dramatically, from η ≈ 0.06
for d = 1 nm to η ≈ 0.5 for d = 5 nm.

The previous discussion about metal spheres can be
generalized to more complex structures. However, to
be quantitative, the solution of the EM problem usu-
ally requires some approximations or the use of numerical
methods, which are outside the scope of this paper. It
is expected that suitable structures could lead to radia-
tive enhancements much larger than those for a sphere.
For example, in a recent study [18], numerical methods
and the Poynting vector approach were applied to closely
spaced gold nano-particles. Values of MRad up to 2 × 105
were calculated for a dipole placed at a junction between
two nano-particles. Here we are sacriﬁcing examples with
larger enhancements for the convenience of having an an-
alytic solution to the problem through Mie theory.

a distance d = 1 or 2 nm. The total rate enhancements are
strongly increased as the dipole gets closer to the surface,
while the radiative enhancements do not change much. These
plots were obtained using an extension of Mie theory, follow-
ing Ref.
[22]. MRad is obtained from the Poynting vector
approach, and MTot from the self-reaction approach. See the
text for further details.

D. Using the Reciprocity Theorem

The

require

two previous approaches

to solve
Maxwell’s equations for the dipolar singularity in the
presence of boundaries, either numerically or analytically.
This can present some problems. Analytically, the dipo-
lar singularity can signiﬁcantly complicate the problem
(for example for a dipole near a sphere [22]). Numerically,
singularities are not always straightforward to introduce.
An additional inconvenience is that the problem needs to
be solved for each dipolar position and orientation that
one wants to study. We introduce here a third approach,
based on the optical reciprocity theorem, which can cir-
cumvent some of these problems. The optical reciprocity
theorem (ORT) states [20] that the ﬁeld E created at a
given point M by a dipole d (at point O) is related to the
ﬁeld E2 at O created by a dipole d2 at M according to
d · E2 = d2 · E. The validity is very general, and in par-
ticular in the presence of absorbing dielectrics or metals
(assuming a local dielectric function). We show here that
this enables to derive the far-ﬁeld properties of the emit-
ter in a given direction from the solution of two Plane
Wave Excitation (PWE) problems, without any source
singularities.

We consider our dipole d at O in Fig. 1, and focus
on its far-ﬁeld emission at a distance R in direction er
deﬁned by angles (θ, φ). The radiation ﬁeld is trans-
verse (no radial component) and can be decomposed into
two components, Eθ and Eφ, along unit vectors eθ and
eφ. The Poynting vector is S = (ǫ0c/2)|E|2er. To ap-
ply the ORT, we consider ﬁrst the problem of a dipole
d2 = d0eθ situated in M. The ORT yields d0Eθ = d · E2,
where E2 is the ﬁeld created by d2 at O. For suﬃ-
ciently large R, the ﬁeld of this dipole in the region of
interest can be approximated by a plane wave propagat-
ing along −er, polarized along eθ, and with amplitude
EP = k2d0 exp(ikR)/(4πǫ0R). We can now choose d0 so
that EP = E0. The problem therefore reduces to solv-
ing Maxwell’s equation for excitation with a plane wave
polarized along eθ, propagating along −er, and of am-
plitude E0. We denote EPW−θ the ﬁeld at O for this
plane wave problem and the ORT then yields for the θ
component of the radiation ﬁeld of d at M:

Eθ =

k2eikR
4πǫ0R|E0|

d · EPW−θ,

(7)

A similar expression is obtained for Eφ, but note that
it requires the solution of a diﬀerent PWE problem with
polarization along eφ. The time-averaged power radiated
per unit solid angle is then

. (9)

It is easy to verify that the above expression is fully con-
sistent with that of an isolated dipole in free-space, yield-
ing the same expression as from a standard approach [25].
We can therefore write the angle-dependent radiative en-
hancement as

MRad(θ, φ) =

|ed · EPW−θ|2
|E0|2

|ed · EPW−φ|2
|E0|2

(10)

where EPW−θ and EPW−φ can be obtained from the
solution of two diﬀerent PWE problems. The impor-
tant result to highlight here is that the radiative property
in a given direction of a dipole in a complex environ-
ment can be obtained by modelling two PWE problems,
without a dipolar singularity. Eq. (10) shows that the
far-ﬁeld emission of a dipole in a given direction is in
some way related to the local ﬁeld enhancement factor
MLoc = |E|2/|E0|2 for PWE from this direction. This
will be the basis for a the generalization of the |E|4 SERS
enhancement in the next section.

We illustrate the use of the ORT approach in Fig. 4.
The angle dependent radiative enhancement in direction
−ez is calculated for dipoles located at point A (see in-
set) with 3 diﬀerent orientations. The results are com-
pared to calculations of the local ﬁeld enhancement fac-
tor MLoc = |E|2/|E0|2 for PWE along ez. Local ﬁeld

and radiative enhancements are nearly identical for a
perpendicular dipole, but clearly diﬀer for other orien-
tations. This highlights the diﬃculties of using purely a
local ﬁeld enhancement approach to the problem of radia-
tive enhancement. The two approaches can be reconciled
by the application of the ORT as given in Eq. (10).
We conclude this section with a few remarks:

• In principle, it is also possible within this approach
to obtain the total radiative enhancement MRad by
integrating MRad(θ, φ). However, it is often not
practical and the Poynting vector approach is usu-
ally better suited for this.

• This approach, contrary to the previous two, yields
no information on the total decay enhancement
MTot or decay to non-radiative modes.

• This approach has hardly been used in the past
[31], but is actually well suited to many experi-
mental situations where only radiative properties
are of interest and where detection is performed in
only one direction. We shall come back to it when
discussing SERS cross sections.

• We would like to stress that the ORT as stated
above does not have, to our knowledge, any direct
physical meaning. Its expression, d · E2 = d2 · E,
looks like a statement about interaction energies
between the two dipoles. However, one would need
the complex conjugates of the ﬁelds (or the dipoles)
to be able to translate this in a statement about the
interaction energy of each dipole with the ﬁeld of
the other. The demonstration of the ORT [20] does
not involve, in fact, the interaction energy. More-
over, the ORT considers the solution of two inde-
pendent problems with a single dipole and not the
problem of the two dipoles at the same time, thus
avoiding mutual self-reactions. For these reasons,
the ORT has to be viewed as mathematical sym-
metry relation embedded in Maxwell’s equations,
which relates the ﬁeld solution of two independent
electromagnetic problems.

E. Quantum yield of a ﬂuorophore

Many applications make use of ﬂuorophores, some-
times in complex environments. There are two impor-
tant characteristics of a ﬂuorophore: its absorption cross-
section and its quantum yield, both of which can be mod-
iﬁed by the environment. Using the previous arguments,
we focus here on the modiﬁed quantum yield. The ab-
sorption cross-section will be discussed later in the con-
text of Surface-Enhanced Fluorescence (SEF).

The ﬂuorescence quantum yield is the proportion of the
population of excited electrons that decay radiatively to
the ground state, hence producing a detectable photon.
It is related to the radiative decay rate ΓRad, but other

FIG. 4: Example of calculations using the ORT approach for
a silver sphere of radius a = 25 nm and a dipole situated at
d = 1 nm from the surface at point A or B (see inset). The
radiative enhancement MRad for a perpendicular dipole and
the local ﬁeld enhancement |E|2/|E0|2 at A and B are shown
for comparison. The angle dependent radiative enhancement
is calculated for the backscattering direction (along −k) for
a dipole at A aligned along either ex (perpendicular), or ez
or ey (parallel). This requires to calculate the ﬁeld at A for
two plane wave problems, with polarization along x and y.
For the perpendicular dipole, M BS
Rad is indistinguishable from
MLoc(A) and MRad. For other dipole orientations, it is clear
that M BS

Rad can be very diﬀerent from MLoc.

(non-radiative) decay paths can exist in a molecule, even
in free-space. This intrinsic decay is characterized by a
rate Γint
NR. For an excited electron, there is competition
between these two mechanisms. In free-space, we assume
ΓRad = Γ0 and the quantum yields is then

Q0 =

Γ0
Γ0 + Γint
NR

Close to a metal surface, there are two eﬀects that will
aﬀect the quantum yield: (i) the radiative decay rate
ΓRad is modiﬁed by a factor MRad, and (ii) there is an
additional non-radiative path corresponding to emission
into dissipative modes in the metal, with rate ΓNR =
(MTot − MRad)Γ0. We can rewrite the modiﬁed quantum
yield as:

where

Using the notations of the previous section and the ex-
pression for Q0, this can be expressed as

At short distances from the metal surface (< 10 nm),
MTot is typically much larger than 1. For a typical ﬂuo-
rophore with a reasonable quantum yield, MTot will com-
pletely dominate the expression in the denominator. The
modiﬁed quantum yield becomes entirely governed by the
interaction with the metal, and all ﬂuorophores should
therefore exhibit the same quantum yield. This aspect
will be discussed further in the context of SEF.

III. SERS CROSS-SECTIONS

A. Scattering processes

Scattering processes (elastic or inelastic) are, in many
ways, similar to SE. Excluding stimulation, the scatter-
ing involves the ‘spontaneous’ creation of a photon in a
mode that was empty. One expects a modiﬁcation of
the scattering cross-section in a similar way as SE rates
are modiﬁed by the environment. As pointed out in the
introduction, the diﬀerence between these two processes
lies in the initial state: (i) excited atom with no photon
for SE and (ii) ground state with one incident photon
for scattering. In the classical description of scattering,
one can formally distinguish between excitation and re-
emission (even though scattering is intrinsically one sin-
gle process). Using the concept of polarizability, α, (for
example Raman or Rayleigh polarizabilities), the excita-
tion part is described by the creation of an induced dipole
d = αELoc, where ELoc is the electric ﬁeld at the scat-
terer position. The re-emission problem of this dipole d
can then be treated using the same tools as that devel-
oped in Sec. II.

interpretation of

the enhancement

There is, however, a fundamental diﬀerence in the
physical
factors.
MTot = PTot/P0 characterizes the ability for the envi-
ronment to extract energy from the dipole, as compared
to free-space. For SE, this corresponds to a modiﬁcation
in the total decay rate of the emitter. For scattering,
because the process (excitation+re-emission) is instanta-
neous, this corresponds to a modiﬁcation of the cross-
section. We deﬁne here the total scattering cross-section
as

σTot = PTot/S0,

S0 = ǫ0c|E0|2/2

σRad =

PRad
S0

,

(14)

(15)

(16)

is the incident ﬂux of the excitation wave (power per unit
area), and PTot is the total power extracted from the
induced dipole, as in Sec. II. The standard deﬁnition of
scattering cross-section [25] corresponds to the radiative
scattering cross-section:

and similarly, the diﬀerential radiative scattering cross-
section:

dσRad
dΩ

(θ, φ) =

PRad(θ, φ)
S0

.

(17)

We emphasize here the importance of distinguishing be-
tween σRad and σTot. The diﬀerence is similar to the situ-
ation in SE between total and radiative decay rates. σRad
corresponds to the radiated scattered ﬁeld which can be
measured experimentally in the far-ﬁeld. σTot includes
σRad, but in addition accounts for non-radiative scatter-
ing events. These events are not observable in the far-
ﬁeld, but they are indeed experienced by the scatterer.
For Raman scattering, it corresponds therefore to the cre-
ation of a phonon, and to the emission of a Stokes shifted
photon, even if this photon is then absorbed by the envi-
ronment and not detectable in the far ﬁeld. This will be
important later when discussing vibrational pumping in
SERS. This a similar situation as in modiﬁed SE, where
an increase in the total decay can be experienced by the
emitter (and measured in time-resolved measurements),
despite the fact that only radiative enhancement is mea-
sured in the far-ﬁeld.

In Raman scattering, the scatterer is excited at a fre-
quency ωL, but the induced dipole oscillates at a diﬀerent
frequency ωR. The diﬀerence in energy corresponds to
the creation (Stokes process) or destruction (Anti-Stokes
process) of a phonon (or vibration). The previous ar-
guments can be easily adapted to the presence of two
diﬀerent frequencies, one for excitation (ωL), and one for
re-emission (ωR). This enables us to address speciﬁcally
in the following the SERS-EM enhancement in the con-
text of SE.

B. Local ﬁeld enhancement factor

In the presence of a dielectric or metallic environment,
the ﬁeld ELoc at the scatterer position is usually diﬀer-
ent to the incident ﬁeld E0. Under certain conditions, in
particular close to metallic surfaces, it is well known that
the local ﬁeld intensity at the surface can be much larger
than that of the incident ﬁeld, leading to a local ﬁeld en-
hancement factor MLoc(ωL). This factor is present for all
linear optical processes, such as absorption or scattering.
For Raman scattering, it is related to the excitation of
the Raman dipole and will depend on the exact Raman
tensor of the probe. We only consider here two simple
and common cases. For an isotropic Raman tensor, the
induced Raman dipole is simply d = αE, and

MLoc = |ELoc|2/|E0|2, .
(18)
For a uni-axial tensor, with a ﬁxed axis along ed, the
induced dipole is then d = α(ed · E)ed and
MLoc = |ed · ELoc|2/|ed · E0|2.

(19)

This enhancement has been studied for many geome-
tries using various approximations. Large values of MLoc

8

are associated with localized surface plasmon resonances
at certain wavelengths. They are also typically highly
localized, i.e at the junction of two closely spaced nano-
particles. We showed in Sec.
II D that these res-
onances are closely related to the radiative SP reso-
nances observed for MRad. MLoc can be estimated to
be ∼ 100 − 1000 at the surface of an Ag colloid at the
plasmon resonance energy. Larger values (105 − 106)
have been predicted at the junction of two particles, or
at sharp corners. For interacting particles the collective
resonance is also red-shifted.

C. SE approach to SERS cross sections

SERS corresponds to Raman scattering in close prox-
imity to metallic surfaces, in particular, silver (Ag) and
gold (Au). Under the right conditions, a large enhance-
ment is observed in the Raman signal, with apparent
cross-sections being as large as 1015 times larger than the
normal cross-section. The local ﬁeld enhancement factor
MLoc can be as large as 105 − 106, but such values are
still too small to explain the large reported SERS cross
sections. The problem is that MLoc describes well the en-
hancement associated with the excitation of the molecule,
but not the re-emission process. The most common
assumption in SERS is that σ ∝ MLoc(ωL)MLoc(ωR),
where MLoc(ωR) is used to model the enhancement as-
sociated with re-emission. This is the so-called |E|4-
enhancement and enables to explain easily values up to
1012. However, this approach has not been carefully jus-
tiﬁed to the best of our knowledge. A few old studies use
a proper description of the dipolar emission in the vicin-
ity of metal surfaces, but analytical results are possible
only for a single (very small) spheres, where a relation
of the type MLoc(ωL)MLoc(ωR) is obtained [32, 33]. The
ﬁrst factor corresponds to excitation while the second
comes from the ﬁeld emitted by the dipole and scattered
by the sphere. The optical reciprocity theorem has been
cited as a possible general justiﬁcation of this factor [17]
without further details.

The treatment of SERS in the framework of modiﬁed
SE modiﬁcation in fact shows that the SERS radiative
cross-section enhancement should be derived from Eq.
(16):

σSERS
Rad
σ0

= MLoc(ωL)MRad(ωR)

(20)

This seems in stark contrast with the standard |E|4 ap-
proach. The diﬀerence stems in the second (re-emission)
term: MRad(ωR), instead of MLoc(ωR), which can be cal-
culated using the tools of Sec. II. These two terms have a
priori nothing in common. . The only relation is through
the orientation of the Raman dipole, which is determined
by the excitation and can aﬀect the value of MRad(ωR).
However, we will now show using the optical reciprocity
theorem that the two approaches can be equivalent under
certain conditions. This enables, accordingly, a rigorous

justiﬁcation of the |E|4 factor and deﬁnes precisely its
conditions of validity.

D. Generalization of the |E|4 factor

In Sec.

II D, we used the ORT to give an alter-
native expression for the radiative enhancement. The
angle-dependent radiative enhancement MRad(θ, φ) was
derived from the solution of two plane wave excitation
(PWE) problems. The expression obtained in Eq. (10)
resembles that of MLoc in Eq.
(19), and is the basis
for the justiﬁcation and generalization of the |E|4 factor.
However, because it applies to angle-dependent radiative
enhancement, an integration is required for the total ra-
diative enhancement and would lead to:

σSERS
Rad
σ0

= MLoc(ωL) ×

|ed · EPW−θ(ωR)|2
|E0|2

+

|ed · EPW−φ(ωR)|2
|E0|2

(cid:21)

Z (cid:20)

dΩ, (21)

where ed is the orientation of the Raman dipole deﬁned
by the Raman tensor and the local ﬁeld polarization.
This expression, although fairly general, has usually no
interest in practise because of its complexity. It would
indeed require to solve PWE problems for plane waves
incident from all possible directions (θ, φ).

However, in most experimental situations, the SERS
signal is detected in the far ﬁeld in only one given direc-
tion (θd, φd). The excitation and detection directions de-
pend on the speciﬁc scattering conﬁguration and usually
correspond to a small solid angle deﬁned by the numerical
aperture of the collecting optics. The physical quantity
relevant to the problem is therefore the diﬀerential radia-
tive SERS cross-section in the detection direction, σd
Rad.
Using Eq.
(10), the SERS enhancement factor in this
direction is then given by

σd
Rad
σd
0

= MLoc(ωL)MRad(θd, φd, ωR)

(22)

For simplicity, we will focus on the most common SERS
setup, namely the back-scattering (BS) conﬁguration,
where excitation and detection are along the same direc-
tion, say (Oz). We also assume that the incident wave is
a plane wave polarized along (Ox). As before, the use of
the ORT requires to ﬁnd the solution of two plane wave
problems, with polarization along (Ox) and (Oy). We
denote EPX and EPY the electric ﬁelds at the scatterer
position for the solution of these two problems. We can
then write the BS radiative SERS enhancement factor as
|ed · EPX(ωR)|2
|E0|2

(cid:21)
(23)
which has some similarities with the conventional |E|4
factor. However, the standard |E|4 factor, which would
be here proportional to |EPX(ωL)|2|EPX(ωR)|2, in fact

|ed · EPY(ωR)|2
|E0|2

= MLoc(ωL)

σBS
Rad
σBS
0

+

(cid:20)

,

9

(24)

(25)

requires the solution of only one plane wave problem,
with polarization along (Ox). Since PWE problems along
(Ox) and (Oy) are two independent EM problems, one
concludes that there must be some information missing
in the |E|4 approach, which is therefore at best an ap-
proximation.

The exact form of this expression can be further simpli-
ﬁed by considering speciﬁc Raman tensors for the probe.
For an isotropic Raman tensor, we have d = αEPX(ωL)
leading to

σBS
Rad
σBS
0

=

|EPX(ωL)|2|EPX(ωR)|2
|E0|4
|EPX(ωL) · EPY(ωR)|2
|E0|4

+

For the common case of a uniaxial Raman tensor, the
induced Raman dipole is d = α(EPX · ed)ed, where ed
is ﬁxed by the orientation of the molecule. The SERS
enhancement is then

σBS
Rad
σBS
0

=

+

|ed · EPX(ωL)|2|ed · EPX(ωR)|2
|ed · E0|2|E0|2
|ed · EPX(ωL)|2|ed · EPY(ωR)|2
|ed · E0|2|E0|2

From the derivation of Eq. (10), one actually sees that
the ﬁrst term in the above expressions corresponds to de-
tection with a polarizer along (Ox), parallel to excitation,
while the second is that for a polarizer along (Oy), per-
pendicular to excitation. The ﬁrst term is equal to the
conventional |E|4 factor. We conclude that this factor
can be exact, for example if all the following conditions
are met: (i) plane wave excitation, (ii) back-scattering
conﬁguration, (iii) polarized detection parallel to excita-
tion, (iv) isotropic or uniaxial Raman tensor. The reason
for the ﬁrst condition is actually quite natural. An emit-
ting dipole cannot distinguish the type of excitation be-
ing used. Therefore, the re-emission part is always iden-
tical, say for plane waves or Gaussian beams. However,
the local ﬁeld enhancement can change from one type of
excitation to another, and the |E|4 approach cannot be
true for both. If condition (iii) is not met, for example
for non-polarized detection, the |E|4 factor should be in
most cases a good approximation, at least for the order
of magnitude of the enhancement. However, to study
depolarization eﬀects, the standard |E|4 factor is not ad-
equate and the full treatment given above is necessary.
Similarly, for other scattering conﬁgurations, for exam-
ple at 90 degrees, the standard |E|4 can lead to erroneous
conclusions. This emphasizes one important conclusion
of this study often overlooked in the past: accurate SERS
enhancement calculations are only possible if the Raman
tensor of the probe and the scattering conﬁguration are
clearly speciﬁed.

E. SERS depolarization ratios and the |E|4 factor

One clear illustration of the failure of the |E|4 fac-
tor is in the calculation of SERS depolarization ratios.
We here focus on the simplest canonical example of a
metallic silver sphere covered by a continuous distribu-
tion of probe molecules on its surface. Simple analytical
expressions could be obtained in the electrostatics ap-
proximation, but we give here exact results, calculated
using Mie theory [19, 21]. Two situations are considered:
(i) molecules with an isotropic Raman tensor, and (ii)
molecules with a uni-axial Raman tensor.
In the sec-
ond case, the axis needs to be speciﬁed, and we assume
that for each molecule it is ﬁxed and perpendicular to
surface of the sphere (this corresponds to a ﬁxed adsorp-
tion geometry). Choosing the back-scattering geometry
along direction (Oz), excitation is polarized along (Ox)
and detected with polarizer along (Ox) (parallel) or (Oy)
(perpendicular). The parallel and perpendicular intensi-
ties are evaluated by integrating the intensities on the
sphere surface, to account for the contribution from all
molecules. According to the previous section, the depo-
larization ratio R = I⊥/Ik for the isotropic case is given
by:

RORT =

|EPX(ωL) · EPY(ωR)|2
|EPX(ωL)|2|EPX(ωR)|2 .

(26)

R
R

Using the conventional |E|4 factor, combined with stan-
dard techniques of depolarization scattering, one would
obtain:

|EPX(ωL)|2|ey · EPX(ωR)|2
|EPX(ωL)|2|ex · EPX(ωR)|2 .

RE4 =

R
R

For the perpendicular uniaxial case, these relations are:

RORT =

|EPX(ωL) · er|2|EPY(ωR) · er|2
|EPX(ωL) · er|2|EPX(ωR) · er|2 ,

R

and

RE4 =

R

|EPX(ωL) · er|2|EPX(ωR) · er|2|ey · er|2
|EPX(ωL) · er|2|EPX(ωR) · er|2|ex · er|2 . (29)

For simplicity, we also make the common assumption
of a negligible Raman shift: ωL ≈ ωR. Despite the ap-
parent similarities between the ORT and |E|4 expres-
sions, they are actually very diﬀerent. Note in partic-
ular the diﬀerence in the numerators. In the ﬁrst case,
one needs to solve a second PWE problem with polar-
ization along (Oy) to obtain EPY, while in the second,
one PWE problem is suﬃcient and the solution is sim-
ply projected onto ey. This conceptual diﬀerence leads
to drastically diﬀerent predictions, as shown in Fig. 5,
where the two models are plotted as a function of wave-
length. In the uniaxial case, the |E|4 approach predicts a
constant (wavelength independent) ratio of 1/5, whereas
a ratio of 1/3 is predicted from the ORT approach. For

of wavelength for a continuous distribution of probe molecules
on the surface of a silver sphere of radius a = 25 nm. Two
Raman tensors are considered:

with the main axis perpendicular to the sphere surface (⊥).
This clearly illustrates the failure of the |E|4 approximation
under certain conditions.

the isotropic tensor, the behavior at the surface plasmon
resonance of the sphere is simply the opposite. The stan-
dard |E|4 approach predicts a ratio increasing to ≈ 0.7,
while the generalized approach predicts a decrease close
to 0. Such discrepancies are also likely for depolarization
ratios calculations in more complex geometries; a subject
which will be explored in further detail in a forthcoming
publication.

F.

Image dipole enhancement

Before discussing these results any further, we would
like to mention an additional enhancement mechanism,
which we have neglected in the previous considerations,
namely: the image dipole enhancement. This does not
apply to SE, but is present for many other processes, in
particular absorption and scattering. This mechanism
has been discussed in the past [34, 35, 36], but has since
then been overlooked. It actually appears naturally when
considering SERS in the framework of modiﬁed sponta-
neous emission. For SE, the self-reaction ﬁeld modiﬁes
the ability of the dipole to radiate energy. Although the
‘re-emission’ enhancement in SERS follows the physics
of modiﬁed SE we have to consider an additional ingre-
dient:
in SE the dipole is already in an ‘excited’ state
with a ﬁxed dipole amplitude, whereas for scattering,
the dipole is constantly driven by an external ﬁeld. A
constant source of energy is then readily available from
the laser. The self-reaction ﬁeld can therefore, in addi-
tion, oppose or amplify the dipole amplitude (ﬁxed by
the dipole moment in SE). This leads to the concept of

eﬀective polarizability. We assume in this section for sim-
plicity that the molecular polarizability and self-reaction
tensor Gr are isotropic. The dipole is driven by both the
external and reﬂected ﬁelds, which leads to a modiﬁed
polarizability of the form [34, 35, 36]

αm = α0 (1 − α0Gr)−1 ,

(30)

-2

10

which in turn leads to an additional enhancement (or
quenching) factor

MIm(ω) =

|αm|2
|α0|2 =

1
|1 − α0(ω)Gr(ω)|2 .

(31)

-3

10

For a dipole near a metallic plane, the self-reaction ﬁeld
in the electrostatics approximation corresponds to the
ﬁeld created by an image dipole and we have

Gr ≈

1
8πǫ0d3

ǫr − 1
ǫr + 1

,

(32)

for a dipole perpendicular to the surface (half of this
result for a parallel dipole). MIm can therefore be called
the image dipole enhancement factor. This factor now
involves both the real and imaginary part of Gr.

The same eﬀect applies to SERS through the eﬀec-
tive Raman polarizability. This has been studied in the
past [34, 35, 36] and leads in the ﬁrst approximation to
an additional enhancement MIm(ωL)MIm(ωR). The im-
age dipole enhancement factors had been proposed in the
past to explain SERS enhancements [34, 35, 36] but were
then thought to be too small and have not been since then
part of the main discussions in the ﬁeld. One reason is
that it has so far been studied mainly for plane metallic
surfaces. In Sec. II C, we have shown that for a sphere
or more complex structures, radiative enhancements can
be large and form a substantial part of MTot. From Eq.
(5), this means that Gr must be strongly aﬀected by
the radiative SP resonances. The common electrostatic
approximation of the image dipole then fails, and it is
possible that image dipole enhancement factors become
non-negligible under these conditions. This factor could
then play a decisive role in explaining the role of the po-
larizability of the probe in the total scattering cross sec-
tion and, in particular, the fact that dyes are the most
eﬀective SERS probes in general.

G. Comparison with Surface Enhanced
Fluorescence

In many cases, the emission from ﬂuorophores very
close to metal surfaces is strongly quenched by large
non-radiative energy transfer. However, several recent
experiments have evidenced ﬂuorescence enhancements,
for example close to Ag or Au surfaces [8, 9]. There still
seems to be some debate about the origin of this enhance-
ment and the exact conditions under which it takes place.
Many of the arguments and tools developed so far can ac-
tually be adapted to the study of Surface Enhanced Flu-
orescence (SEF), and shed light onto this problem. This

uated at a distance d = 1 or 2 nm from a silver sphere of

Q0 is assumed to be 1, but the results are insensitive to Q0
unless it is extremely small. (a) Modiﬁed quantum yield (see
Sec. II E). This is in principle not directly observable in SEF,
because local ﬁeld enhancements also play an important role
during excitation of the ﬂuorophore.

quenching and not enhancement. (c) Inﬂuence of a and d on
the ﬂuorencence enhancement. Enhancements are observed
at the surface plasmon resonance of the sphere. Largest en-
hancements are observed for the smallest sphere and for a
dipole slightly away from the surface. Note that for compar-
ison with most experiments, it is necessary to integrate the
ﬂuorescence intensity from all points on the surface of the
sphere.

is also relevant to the problem of ﬂuorescence quenching
under SERS conditions.

but diﬀerent situations where either the ﬁrst or second
terms in Eq. (34) dominates with respect to the other.

Fluorescence is very similar to scattering; it involves
absorption of a photon, followed by emission. The same
enhancement mechanisms as that derived for SERS are
therefore expected. The absorption should be subject to
the local ﬁeld enhancements, and the emission is simply
SE and should follow the same enhancements. The image
dipole enhancement should also be present for absorp-
tion, but we neglect this aspect here for simplicity. The
crucial diﬀerence is that SERS is instantaneous while ﬂu-
orescence is a multi-step process. This means that both
enhancements (local ﬁeld and SE type) contribute to the
SERS cross-section. For ﬂuorescence, the local ﬁeld en-
hancement does also lead to a modiﬁcation of the absorp-
tion cross-section, but the SE-type enhancements only
lead to modiﬁcation of the decay rates (radiative and
non-radiative). To put it diﬀerently, once a photon is ab-
sorbed and excites an electron in ﬂuorescence, enhance-
ments cannot lead to more energy being extracted from
this electron, but only to energy being extracted faster.
To be more speciﬁc, we consider a ﬂuorophore as in
Sec. II E, with an absorption cross-section k0, a radiative
rate Γ0, and a quantum yield Q0. We neglect here the
shift between excitation and ﬂuorescence energies. Under
a given excitation, the photon ﬂux is n0 ∝ |E0|2 and the
power radiated by ﬂuorescence in free-space is (in number
of photons per unit time):

P Fluo
0

= k0n0Q0

(33)

We have assumed here that the power is small enough
to avoid saturation eﬀects in the excited state. In this
expression, k0n0 is the number of photons absorbed per
unit time. For each excited electron, the probability of
being emitted radiatively is simply Q0. If the ﬂuorophore
is now close to a metal surface, we can use the same
expression, with the modiﬁed quantum yield Q given
by Eq. (13). The absorption rate is also modiﬁed be-
cause the ﬁeld intensity at the ﬂuorophore position is now
MLoc|E0|2. The ﬂuorescence enhancement (or quench-
ing) is then:

These aspects are illustrated in Fig. 6, for the case
of a silver sphere, where various cases of dipole orien-
tation, sphere radius, and distance from the surface are
considered. These plots show that the conditions for ﬂuo-
rescence enhancements depend on many parameters, and
are in general not trivial to determine. There are however
a few general observations:

• The region of ﬂuorescence enhancement is rel-
atively small compared to that of ﬂuorescence
quenching. It requires an eﬃcient coupling to the
radiative SP resonance of the sphere. This point
had already been emphasized in Ref. [8].

• The largest enhancement can in principle be ob-
tained for the smallest sphere radii (see Fig. 6(c)).
This is the opposite conclusion to that reached in
Ref. [8], based on the idea that scattering is more
dominant compared to absorption for the largest
sphere. This re-emphasizes the fact that these ef-
fects are not simple and require a careful consider-
ation of all enhancement and quenching factors.

• Increasing slightly the distance d between emit-
ter and surface in general leads to higher ﬂuores-
cence enhancements. This is because the local ﬁeld
enhancement does not change much at short dis-
tances, while non-radiative decay decreases sharply
with d. For dyes adsorbed on the surface, varying
d is not straightforward. However, for ﬂuorescing
quantum dots, d should depend on the size of the
quantum dot, and a careful tuning could possibly
lead to large ﬂuorescence enhancements [9].

IV. DISCUSSION

In view of the previous description of SERS within
the framework of modiﬁed spontaneous emission, we can
summarize the electromagnetic enhancement of the ra-
diative SERS cross section as

P SEF
P Fluo
0

= MLoc

MRad
MTot + Q−1

0 − 1

(34)

σSERS
Rad
σ0

= MIm(ωL)MLoc(ωL)MRad(ωR)MIm(ωR),

(35)

Moreover, in many cases, Q−1
0 − 1 can be neglected.
This expression clearly identiﬁes the sources of enhance-
ment or quenching. There are in fact two competing
mechanisms: (i) the ﬁrst term, the local ﬁeld enhance-
ment MLoc, which in most situations of interest is larger
or much larger than 1, and leads to enhanced ﬂuores-
cence, and (ii) the second term which is the radiative
eﬃciency of the emitter in electromagnetic interaction
with the metal. This term is smaller (and sometimes
much smaller) than 1 and corresponds to quenching.
Quenching and enhancement of ﬂuorescence are therefore
two sides of the same problem. The various reports on
quenching and enhancement of ﬂuorescence are nothing

where MIm is given by Eq. (31), MLoc is given by Eq.
(18) (or Eq. (19) depending on the Raman tensor), MRad
is given by Eq. (10) (for detection along a speciﬁc direc-
tion), and with all the expressions evaluated at at either
the laser (ωL) or the Raman (Stokes or Anti-Stokes) fre-
quencies (ωR).

The ﬁrst two terms relate to the excitation part, while
the last two to re-emission. Moreover, MRad is related to
MLoc for plane wave excitation using the ORT, in a way
deﬁned in the previous sections. We conclude this study
by discussing brieﬂy a few aspects of this expression that
have been, in our opinion, not fully accounted for in the
past.

A.

Image dipole enhancement factors

A detailed discussion of this factor requires a full pa-
per in itself. Our numerical simulations (not shown here)
indicate that this factor contributes to a ∼ 103 enhance-
ment at most. It is however important that this factor is
the only one in Eq. (35) that involves the linear polariz-
ability of the molecule. It can therefore be the natural ori-
gin for a number of characteristics in SERS. The fact that
only dyes exhibit the largest SERS cross section (having
large optical polarizabilities in the visible) comes as a
natural consequence here. We only mention brieﬂy too
that this factor can explain the apparent resonance pro-
ﬁle observed in many SERS experiments [15, 37] and can
be of additional importance in Surface Enhanced Reso-
nant Raman Scattering (SERRS).

B. Fluorescence quenching and the SERS
continuum

We consider here the common case of a dye under
SERS conditions. It is well known that ﬂuorescence is
strongly quenched when large SERS signals are observed.
This should in principle be derived naturally within our
framework. However, we have seen that SERS and SEF
are in fact subject to the same local ﬁeld enhancement
factor and one could therefore expect the two to be cor-
In fact, combining Eqs. (20) and (34) we see
related.
that the SERS and SEF enhancement factors are di-
rectly related through MSERS = MTotMSEF. In a typ-
ical SERS situation, MTot can be very large, say 105,
and SERS enhancements are therefore much larger than
ﬂuorescence enhancements. This factor is still however
much too small to oﬀset the intrinsic larger eﬃciencies
of ﬂuorescence processes as compared to Raman, which
typically diﬀer by factors of ∼ 1010 − 1015. We would
therefore expect ﬂuorescence to be enhanced less than
Raman but still remain strong compared to Raman un-
der SERS conditions.

To understand this apparent paradox we need to re-
examine the situation of SEF under conditions of very
high enhancement, where the total decay rate MTotΓ0
is many orders of magnitude larger than usual. When
decay rates become comparable or smaller than the typ-
ical energy relaxation times, then the electron dynamics
in the relaxation pathways is strongly modiﬁed. Very
close to a noble metal surface MTot can be ∼ 105 or
higher. For a typical SE lifetime of a few ns, the mod-
iﬁed lifetime would only be of the order of a few tens
of fs or less, i.e much shorter than typical energy relax-
ation times in molecules. In this model, this would imply
that absorbed photons do not have time to relax and are
emitted at the frequency they were absorbed. Standard
ﬂuorescence would therefore be quenched and appears as
an increase in Rayleigh scattering. Indeed, such enhance-
ments have been reported under SERS conditions, but it
is diﬃcult to test whether they are true Rayleigh scat-

13

tering or strongly modiﬁed ﬂuorescence. Pushing this
argument further, for the shortest decay times, the un-
certainty principle would also imply that energy is not
well deﬁned in the intermediate levels of the relaxation
path with a typical spread of 1600 cm−1 for times of
10 fs. The whole process would qualitatively result in a
very broad emission from all possible intermediate vir-
tual states. We propose that this could be the origin of
the strongly debated SERS continuum, which is observed
in many SERS experiments. A proper treatment of such
extreme conditions however requires a full quantum me-
chanical study of absorption-relaxation-emission similar
to that of Ref. [17].

C. Non-radiative eﬀects in SERS

Finally, this approach also highlights the importance
of non-radiative eﬀects in SERS. In ﬂuorescence, non-
radiative eﬀects manifest themselves as a reduced quan-
tum yield, because of the competition between radiative
and non-radiative decays. In SERS, because scattering
is instantaneous, there is not such a competition, and
radiative and non-radiative emission can occur indepen-
denly of each other. Similarly to SE, we can deﬁne a total
(radiative+non-radiative) SERS cross-section (we ignore
here MIm).

σSERS
Tot
σ0

= MLoc(ωL)MTot(ωR)

(36)

Under SERS conditions, this cross-section can be much
larger than the observable radiative SERS cross-section,
as given in Eqs. (20), (22), or (35). The diﬀerence cor-
responds to Raman processes resulting in emission of a
Raman photon in the non-radiative modes of the metal.
These Raman photons are obviously non-observable in
the far-ﬁeld, but they do corresponds to a real Raman
event, and therefore to the creation or destruction of a vi-
bration in the molecule. This total SERS cross-section is
therefore the one that is relevant when studying phonon
population dynamics,
in particular eﬀects such as vi-
brational pumping [38, 39]. This could make the much
debated hypothesis of vibrational pumping more likely,
since the cross-section for phonon pumping could actu-
ally be much larger than that inferred for the radiative
SERS cross-sections in the far-ﬁeld.

D. Conclusion

In closing, we have presented a consistent formula-
tion of cross-section enhancements in SERS and ﬂuo-
rescence within the framework of modiﬁed spontaneous
emission. The local ﬁeld enhancements, and the compe-
tition between radiative and non-radiative decays have
been shown to have diﬀerent consequences for ﬂuores-
cence and for scattering. This description provides a rel-
atively simple way of designing and modelling metallic

nano-structures for speciﬁc applications, either in SEF,
or in SERS. The model also highlights the shortcom-
ings of the usual |E|4-proportionality in the SERS cross
section, often assumed in the literature, and provides a
direct recipe for its calculation based on classical elec-
tromagnetic theory, self-reaction eﬀects, and the optical
reciprocity theorem. This approach could explain some

of the longstanding puzzles in SERS like the presence of
a SERS continuum, the increase in Rayleigh scattering
simultaneous with SERS, and the peculiar ability of dyes
to be very eﬃcient probes. Full details of calculations
using this EM SERS cross section with applications to
other more complex and relevant geometries will be re-
ported elsewhere.

Abstract

Theories of solvation free energies often involve electrostatic potentials at the

position of a solute charge. Simulation calculations that apply cutoﬀs and

periodic boundary conditions based on molecular centers result in center-

dependent contributions to electrostatic energies due to a systematic sorting

of charges in radial shells. This sorting of charges induces a surface-charge

density at the cutoﬀ sphere or simulation-box boundary that depends on the

choice of molecular centers. We identify a simple solution that gives correct,

center-independent results, namely the radial integration of charge densities.

Our conclusions are illustrated for a Lennard-Jones solute in water. The

present results can aﬀect the parameterization of force ﬁelds.

Accurate simulation calculations of free energies of solvation require a careful treat-

ment of long-range electrostatic interactions. Recent computational and theoretical work

on single-ion free energies1 has converged upon a common set of ideas that are, however,

discussed in slightly diﬀerent ways, i.e., Gaussian ﬂuctuations of electrostatic potentials,2

second-order perturbation theory,3 or linear-response theory.4,5 These approaches require

the calculation of electrostatic potentials at atom positions on a solute molecule at frac-

tional charge states (e.g., uncharged or fully charged). However, a lack of consensus on how

electrostatic potentials should be evaluated means that calculated partial contributions to

single-ion free energies are often not fully comparable. Diﬀerences arise because of a common

practice of evaluating electrostatic interactions considering whole molecules. This can lead

to spurious dependences on the choice of the center of a molecule. Similar issues arose in

calculations of the electrostatic potential diﬀerence of the water-vapor interface: seemingly

identical calculations of electrostatic potentials can produce diﬀerent ﬁnal results.6

Discrepancies in calculated electrostatic potentials were noted recently by ˚Aqvist and

Hansson.5 The present paper resolves the diﬃculties noted there. We will focus on the

calculation of electrostatic potentials at the position of a solute molecule in a polar ﬂuid,

discussing the eﬀects of diﬀerent methods of summing charge interactions. This leads us to a

simple, center independent, and feasible recipe used to analyze electrostatic potentials, both

in ﬁnite and inﬁnite systems, namely spherical integration of charge densities. To illustrate

our general results, we will show data for Lennard-Jones (LJ) solutes in water.

Two diﬀerent center dependences will be considered (see Figure 1). The ﬁrst is associated

with the center of the solvent molecule denoted by M used to bin electrostatic interactions be-

tween solvent molecules and the solute molecule. The second center dependence to consider

is the dependence on the solvent center P that might be used in implementing minimum-

image periodic boundary conditions (PBC’s) by translating a whole solvent molecule into

the primary simulation box. These two centers M and P would often coincide but they need

not. The eﬀects considered are distinct.

For molecule-based summation, the electrostatic potential at the center of a spherical

2

LJ solute molecule depends strongly on the choice of the center M of a water molecule

that deﬁnes into which shell it belongs. Shown in Figure 2 are curves φM (r) of potential

contributions of water molecules with their center M within a radius r of the solute molecule,

h. . .i denotes a canonical ensemble average over a system of N SPC water molecules7 with

oxygen and hydrogen positions ri,O, ri,H1 and ri,H2, respectively (ri,O = |ri,O|, etc.); and one

uncharged LJ solute atom at position rS = 0 with SPC-water LJ parameters. δ(r) is the

Dirac delta function. qO and qH are the charges on the oxygen and hydrogen sites of SPC

water (−0.82e and 0.41e, respectively). ri,M is the center of water molecule i, deﬁned as

ri,M = wri,O + (1 − w)(ri,H1 + ri,H2)/2. The atom positions ri,O, ri,H1 and ri,H2 are shifted

molecule-based under PBC’s. (That is, the center P=M is mapped into the simulation box,

leaving the molecule intact so that individual atoms can actually be outside the simulation

box.) For weights w = 1 and 0, the center position ri,M coincides with the oxygen position

and the hydrogen bisector, respectively.

The molecule-based potential deﬁned in eq 1 contrasts with the charge-based potential

ρq(r) is the radially averaged charge density. In eq 2b, PBC’s for the positions of charges

i,O, rs

i,H1 and rs

i,H2 are applied on the basis of atoms rather than molecules.

Each of the φM (r) curves in Figure 2 for diﬀerent centers M reaches a plateau value

after 0.6 to 0.8 nm distance from the solute. However, the plateau values diﬀer not only in

magnitude but also in sign for diﬀerent choices of M, whereas identical choices of M give

agreement between simulations under PBC’s and using clusters with 256 and 1024 water

molecules. The diﬀerences are caused by the M-dependent sorting of molecules, even for

3

identical conﬁgurations (positions and orientations) of the solvent molecules. If the center

M is close to the oxygen atom, the ﬁrst layer of molecules considered in the integration

in eq 1 predominantly includes water molecules with the oxygen atoms facing the solute.

Correspondingly, φM (r) starts out negative as negative contributions of the oxygen atoms

dominate. On the other hand, if the center M is close to the hydrogen atoms, the ﬁrst

layer of molecules considered in the integration will predominantly have the hydrogen atoms

facing the solute (see Figure 1, middle). As a consequence, φM (r) starts out positive and

also reaches a positive plateau value. Results for centers M between the oxygen and the

hydrogen bisector fall between the two curves.

For a ﬁnite sample, the diﬀerent curves all converge to the same value when all contribu-

tions have been summed up (Figure 2, middle and bottom). Convergence is therefore reached

only after crossing the interface to the exterior, so that surface-potential contributions are

included. For the cluster simulations of Figure 2 (middle and bottom), the potential crosses

a liquid-vacuum interface.

Similar problems arise with molecule-based cutoﬀs (or residue-based cutoﬀs for macro-

molecules). For instance, if the distance to the oxygen atom of a water molecule is used to

determine whether a particle interacts with that water molecule, a characteristic surface-

charge density is induced at the cutoﬀ sphere. The oxygen density seen by the solute is

essentially a step function. The hydrogen density is reduced just inside the cutoﬀ and

nonzero just beyond the cutoﬀ, resulting in a net negative charge density just inside the

cutoﬀ sphere and a net positive charge density just outside. This eﬀective surface-dipole

density strongly aﬀects the potential at the site of the particle. That eﬀect is independent

of the cutoﬀ length, as the surface area and charge-dipole interaction vary with the square

and the inverse square of the cutoﬀ length, respectively.

When whole molecules are shifted under PBC’s this leads to another level of ill-deﬁnition

of electrostatic potentials. Shifting molecules as a whole means that PBC’s are applied based

on a center P with coordinates ri,P = uri,O + (1 − u)(ri,H1 + ri,H2)/2 with weight u. If that

center P coincides with the center M of the φM integration, then the plateau in φM (r)

4

reached after the ﬁrst layer of water molecules remains essentially unchanged when reaching

the box boundary. However, if P and M do not coincide, φM (r) crosses over from the M

curve to the P curve when the box boundary is reached. This can be seen in Figure 2 (top)

where the φM (r) curve for M equal to O (w = 1, u = 0) crosses over to the hydrogen-bisector

curve (w = 0, u = 0) when the hydrogen-bisector is used for PBC’s (P=HH). Clearly, this

is an unphysical behavior associated with summing electrostatic interactions and applying

PBC’s on the basis of molecules.

How can we eliminate these diﬃculties of calculating electrostatic potentials in computer

simulations? The unphysical false plateaus observed for φM (r) in Figure 2 stem from asso-

ciating partial charges with molecular centers. By choosing a center M, the water molecules

were systematically sorted for analysis. For a ﬁnite system, integration to inﬁnity is re-

quired to get the correct result. And that result will then contain troublesome and undesired

surface-potential contributions. Under PBC’s, that integration cannot be performed easily,

as is manifest from the dependence of the limiting value of the potential on the choice of

the molecular center P upon which PBC’s are applied.

However, if we alternatively integrate over charge densities ρq(r) rather than sum over

molecules, we will obtain a well-deﬁned result for the potential that coincides with taking

the limit of an inﬁnite system before extending the integral to inﬁnity. The charge-based

potential φq(r) is deﬁned in eq 2a. For a ﬁnite system, eqs 1 and 2 will give identical results

if the integration volume covers the whole system (extending beyond the interface to the

container, vacuum etc.). However, unlike eq 1 the potential φq(r) deﬁned in eq 2a will reach

a plateau beyond the correlation length of the charge correlation ρq(r) independent of an

arbitrary choice of the center M of a molecule. (As shown in Figure 2, that plateau is reached

within about 1 nm from the neutral LJ solute. Larger correlation lengths were observed for

a charged solute.9)

These issues would be largely irrelevant with conventional Ewald treatment of electro-

static potentials, where the simulation box is replicated periodically in space. However,

center dependences can arise with modiﬁcations of the standard Ewald approach. The

5

electrostatic potentials of periodic images can be summed up using the Ewald potential

ϕE(r).9,10 ϕE(r) is the periodic solution of Poisson’s equation ∆ϕE(r) = −4π[δ(r) − 1/V ]

for a unit point charge and a homogeneous background in the unit cell V . The equivalents

of the electrostatic potentials φM (r) and φq(r) deﬁned in eqs 1 and 2a for periodic systems

are then

Again, minimum-image PBC’s for ri,α and rs

i,α are applied on the basis of molecular centers

P and individual atoms, respectively. Figure 3 shows that the charge-based Ewald potential

and 1/r curves φE

q (r) and φq(r) converge but that the molecule-based curve φE

M (r) for

periodic systems also converges to φE

q (r) rather than φM (r). This is expected because the

Ewald potential is fully periodic.

Physical modiﬁcation of the Ewald potential sacriﬁce this periodicity. The Ewald poten-

tial is the limit of performing the lattice sum with the growing lattice embedded in a sphere

cut out of a medium with inﬁnite dielectric constant ǫ′ = ∞ (tin-foil boundary conditions).

Total potential energies without the eﬀect of that dielectric background ǫ′ = ∞ require sub-

traction of a term proportional to the square of the net dipole moment M of the simulation

box.11 Expressed as an eﬀective potential, we can subtract a term 2πr2/3V from ϕE(r):

ϕE,ǫ′=1(r) = ϕE(r) − 2πr2/3V . This destroys the periodicity. Use of the modiﬁed potential

ϕE,ǫ′=1(r) in eq 3a forces φE

M (r) to converge to φM (r), as shown in Figure 3. However, the

result for the potential φE

M (r) at the solute site then again depends on the particular choice

of the molecular center P upon which PBC’s are applied. Clearly, to reproduce the non-

physical eﬀects of integrating the potential using 1/r with molecule-based sorting requires

subtraction of a non-periodic term from the Ewald potential and application of the potential

outside the “universe,” i.e., the simulation box.

It must be noted that subtracting the r2 term from the Ewald potential has little eﬀect

if the integration is based on charges (Figure 3). However, applying the r2 modiﬁcation by

6

molecules rather than atoms leads to large diﬀerences in the potential. The charge-based

potential (eq 3a) with P=O molecular-based shifting of the r2 term has a value diﬀerent in

sign from the charge-based curves shown in Figure 3.12 We also emphasize that changing

the dielectric background to a ﬁnite value ǫ′ < ∞ in the Ewald sum should not aﬀect the

charging of an ion at the center of the box. The dipolar ﬁeld induced by a background

ǫ′ beyond a spherical cavity around r = 0 is proportional to r · M which is zero at the

position r = 0 of the uncharged particle. When a point multipole is charged from zero, that

contribution is also zero because of averaging over all orientations.

The results of this paper explain the diﬀerences in the sign of the electrostatic potential

at the position of an uncharged LJ particle in water between ˚Aqvist and Hansson5 (M=O

based sorting, 1/r: negative potential), Rick and Berne12 (charge-based sorting; Ewald

and r2 modiﬁcation with P=O based shifting: negative potential) and Pratt at al.3 as

well as Hummer et al.9 (charge based sorting; Ewald, 1/r and a generalized reaction-ﬁeld

interaction: positive potential). The best current value for that potential is positive.

In

that context a re-examination of several results regarding free energies of charged species

might be worthwhile. For instance, free energies of anions were found to be less negative in

Ref. 13 than in Ref. 9 but more negative for cations. That can be explained if molecule-based

summation has been used in Ref. 13 using a center M at or close to the oxygen atom of

water. The present results also aﬀect the parameterization of force ﬁelds involving charged

species. Finally, we emphasize that the errors induced by molecule-based summation are

independent of the cutoﬀ length for suﬃciently large cutoﬀs. If the induced surface-charge

distribution were symmetrically distributed on a spherical shell then it follows from Gauss’s

law that the correction to the induced electrostatic potential inside the spherical shell would

be a constant. In that case, the contributions of M-dependent sorting would cancel each

other for an overall neutral, polar solute but not for a solute with a net charge.

Our results suggest that these issues are primarily matters of analysis of conﬁgurational

simulation data. A variety of methods may be used to obtain the conﬁgurational data. The

center dependences considered here are introduced by the analysis of electrostatic poten-

7

tials and are often larger than the secondary diﬀerences in the conﬁgurational data due to

variations in their production.

The following general recipe for electrostatic-potential calculations emerges: (1) Elec-

trostatic interactions should be integrated based on charge densities rather than individual

molecules to give correct results for atoms and molecules carrying point charges or spatially

extended charge distributions. For molecule-based summation, the calculated potentials

φ(r) level out nicely but the plateau values depend on the arbitrary choice of molecular

centers. (2) In simulations using PBC’s, all charges should be mapped into the simulation

box. Molecule-based PBC’s result in center-dependent surface-charge densities.

(3) Un-

der PBC’s, Ewald summation provides an accurate way of summing up all interactions,

minimizing ﬁnite-size eﬀects.

Note added in proof. Ashbaugh and Wood14 come to similar conclusions regard-

ing molecule-center dependences of electrostatic potentials in their comparison of Ewald

summation9 and cutoﬀ calculations.15 In particular, these authors also ﬁnd the potential to

be positive for a neutral LJ solute in water.

respectively) and enriched just outside.

FIG. 2. Integrated electrostatic potentials at the position of an uncharged LJ solute in SPC

140 000 Monte-Carlo passes of a system with 255 SPC water molecules and one LJ solute with

SPC-water LJ parameters (using Ewald summation; see Ref. 8 for simulation details). M and P

denote the centers of sorting and applying PBC’s, respectively, where O is the oxygen and HH the

hydrogen-bisector position. The middle and bottom panel show the results of averaging over 100 000

and 300 000 Monte-Carlo passes of clusters of 256 and 1024 SPC water molecules, respectively, and

one LJ particle at the center, again with SPC-water LJ parameters. In the cluster simulations,

electrostatic interactions were calculated using 1/r Coulomb interactions without cutoﬀ. The

asymptotic value of charge-based integration using the Ewald potential is shown for reference.

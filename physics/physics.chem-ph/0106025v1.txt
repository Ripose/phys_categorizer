We present results of wavepacket simulations of scattering of an oriented methane molecule from
a ﬂat surface including all nine internal vibrations. At a translational energy up to 96 kJ/mol we
ﬁnd that the scattering is almost completely elastic. Vibrational excitations when the molecule hits
the surface and the corresponding deformation depend on generic features of the potential energy
surface. In particular, our simulation indicate that for methane to dissociate the interaction of the
molecule with the surface should lead to an elongated equilibrium C–H bond length close to the
surface.

I. INTRODUCTION

The dissociation of methane on transition metals is an important reaction in catalysis.

It is the rate limiting
step in steam reforming to produce syngas.1 It is also prototypical for C–H activation in other processes. A large
number of molecular beam experiments in which the dissociation energy was measured as a function of translational
energy2–18 as well as various bulb gas experiments19–24 have already been done on this system. These experiments
have contributed much to our understanding of the mechanism of the dissociation. However, our knowledge is still
small compared to what we know about a well-studied reaction as H2 dissociation.

Some years ago we performed a multi-conﬁgurational time-dependent Hartree (MCTDH) study of CH4 dissoci-
ation on Ni(111)25 with a potential energy surface (PES) based on our earlier density functional theory (DFT)
calculations.26–30 We included the distance of the methane molecule to the surface, a C–H distance, and the orienta-
tion of methane as coordinates. Other wavepacket simulations focused on (some of) these coordinates in combination
with lattice motion on several metals.31–34 Other theoretical studies on this system used DFT calculations35–37 too
and classical stochastic trajectory simulations.38,39

None of the wavepacket simulations published so far have looked at the role of the internal vibrations of methane.
It was observed experimentally that vibrationally hot CH4 dissociates more readily than cold CH4, with the energy in
the internal vibrations being about as eﬀective as the translational energy in inducing dissociation.2,3,5,8,10 However, a
more detailed assessment of the importance of the internal vibrations could not be made, because of the large number
of internal vibrations. A recent DFT calculation also showed that the transition state for CH4 dissociation on Ni(111)
involves considerable internal excitation of the molecule.35 In this paper we report on wavepacket simulations that
we have done to determine which and to what extent internal vibrations are important for the dissociation. We are
not able yet to simulate the dissociation including all internal vibrations. Instead we have simulated the scattering of
methane, for which all internal vibrations can be included. By looking at vibrational excitations and the deformation
of the molecule when it hits the surface we can derive information that is relevant for the dissociation. We have used
PESs that have been developed with Ni(111) in mind, but our results should hold for other surfaces as well.

We have again used the MCTDH method for the wavepacket simulations, because it can deal with a large number
of degrees of freedom and with large grids.40,41 This method has been applied successfully to gas phase reactions and
reactions at surfaces.42–53

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. We start with a brief description of the MCTDH method. Then the
various PESs that we have used are derived. (A harmonic intramolecular PES is adapted to include anharmonicities
in the C–H distance, the decrease of the C–H bond energy due to interactions with the surface, and the increase of
the C–H bond length also due to interactions with the surface.) The results of the simulations are presented and
discussed next. We focus on excitation probabilities and deformation of the molecule when it hits the surface. The
implications for the dissociation are discussed separately. We end with a summary and some general conclusions.

A. The MCTDH Method

We give here a short overview of the MCTDH approximation for completeness. More details can be found in
Refs. 40 and 41. The exact wave-function of a D-dimensional system, is approximated by an expression of the form

ΨMCTDH(q1, . . . , qD; t) =

cn1...nD (t) ψ(1)

n1 (q1; t) . . . ψ(D)

nD (qD; t).

Xn1...nD

From this expression, it is possible to obtain the equations of motion for the one-dimensional functions ψ(i)
ni (qi; t) and
for the correlation coeﬃcients cn1...nD (t). Without loss of generality we can choose the ψ(i)
ni ’s to be natural single-
particle states.41 They insure that we obtain the best approximation to the exact Ψ(q1, . . . , qD; t) for a ﬁxed number
of conﬁgurations; i.e., they minimize the expression h∆|∆i where

∆ = Ψ − ΨMCTDH,

and where Ψ is the exact wave-function. The natural single-particle functions are eigenstates of the reduced density
operators.

used the variable-order variable-step Adams method, as implemented in the NAG library.54 This method gave good
convergence for all described simulations. For the hardest simulation the method needed 195027 calculations of the
time derivatives for 35000 atomic units simulation time, which took around two days CPU-time on an 166 MHz.
SUN Ultra SPARC. The singularities in Eqs. (5), (6), and (10) have been treated numerically by the regularization
procedure described in Ref. 41.

The natural single-particle states have some small advantages over other possible choices of single-particle states.
The most important one is that one can directly see from h ˜ψ(i)
n i how well ΨMCTDH approximates the exact wave-
function. How much a natural single-particle functions contributes to the wave-function is given by the eigenvalue ν(i)
n
of the reduced density matrix. In an approximate MCTDH simulation h ˜ψ(i)
n i is an approximation for this exact
eigenvalue. The natural single-particle functions are also convenient for interpreting the results of a simulations.

B. The Potential Energy Surfaces

The PESs we used can all be written as

where Vintra is the intramolecular PES and Vsurf is the interaction with the surface. For the Vintra we looked at four
diﬀerent types of PESs.

Vtotal = Vintra + Vsurf ,

(11)

Vintra = Vharm =

The ﬁrst one is completely harmonic. We have used normal mode coordinates for the internal vibrations, because
these are coupled only very weakly. In the harmonic approximation this coupling is even absent so that we can write
Vintra as

the summation is over the internal vibrations, Xi’s are mass-weighted displacement coordinates and ki are mass-
(see Table I for deﬁnitions and values); (X1 is the mass-weighted overall translation
weighted force constants.
along the surface normal).55 The force constants have been obtained by ﬁtting them on the experimental vibrational
frequencies of CH4 and CD4.56,57

We have assumed that the interaction with the surface is only through the hydrogen atoms that point towards the

surface. We take the z-axis as the surface normal. In this case the surface PES is given by

Vsurf =

NH

e−αzi,

A
NH

Xi=1
where NH is the number of hydrogens that points towards the surface, α=1.0726 atomic units and A=6.4127 Hartree.
These parameters are chosen to give the same repulsion as the PES that has been used in an MCTDH wavepacket
simulation of CH4 dissociation.25

If we write Vsurf in terms of normal mode coordinates, then we obtain for one hydrogen pointing towards the surface

Vsurf = Ae−α1X1 e−α2X2 e−α3X3 e−α4X4 ,

where A as above, and α’s as given in Table II. X2, X3 and X4 correspond all to a1 modes of the C3v symmetry.
There is no coupling between the modes X5 to X10 in the Vsurf part of the PES, which are all e modes of the C3v
symmetry. Fig. 1(a) shows a contour plot of the cross-section of the total harmonic PES with one hydrogen pointing
towards the surface in the translational mode X1 and the ν3 asymmetrical stretch mode X4.

For two hydrogens we obtain

2. An anharmonic intramolecular potential

X2, X3 and X4 corresponds to a1 modes in the C3v symmetry. Because these last six coordinates correspond to
degenerate e modes of the C3v symmetry, the β parameters are not unique.

Even though we do not try to describe the dissociation of methane in this paper, we do want to determine which
internal vibration might be important for this dissociation. The PES should at least allow the molecule to partially
distort as when dissociating. The harmonic PES does not do this. A number of changes have therefor been made.
The ﬁrst is that we have describe the C–H bond by a Morse PES.

VMorse = De

where De = 0.1828 Hartree (the dissociation energy of methane in the gas-phase) and ∆ri the change in bond length
from the equilibrium distance. γ was calculated by equating the second derivatives along one bond of the harmonic
and the Morse PES. If we transform Eq. (17) back into normal mode coordinates, we obtain

VMorse = De

Xi=1 h

with De as above. γ’s are given in Tables III and IV. Note that, although we have only changed the PES of the bond
lengths, the ν4 umbrella modes are also aﬀected. This is because these modes are not only bending, but also contain
some changes of bond length.

The new intramolecular PES now becomes

Vintra = Vharm + VMorse − Vcorr,

where Vharm is as given in Eq. (12) and Vcorr is the quadratic part of VMorse, which is already in Vharm. Fig. 1(b) shows
a contour plot of the cross-section of this total anharmonic PES with one hydrogen pointing towards the surface in
the translational mode X1 and the ν3 asymmetrical stretch mode X4. (We would like to point out that there are,
of course, various anharmonic PESs for methane in the literature. There are two reasons why we haven’t use them.
First, these PESs are not in appropriate form to use then with the MCTDH method.40,41 Second, these PESs are
generally quite complicated. We prefer to keep it as simple as possible, because at this moment we’re only interested
in qualitative eﬀects.)

3. Intramolecular potential with weakening C–H bonds

When the methane molecule approach the surface the overlap of substrate orbitals and anti-bonding orbitals of the
molecule weakens the C–H bonds. We want to include this eﬀect for the C–H bonds of the hydrogens pointing towards
the surface. We have redeﬁned the VMorse given in Eq. (18) and also replace it in Eq. (19). A sigmoidal function is
used to switch from the gas phase C–H bond to a bond close to the surface. We have used the following, somewhat
arbitrary, approximations. (i) The point of inﬂection should be at a reasonable distance from the surface. It is set to
the turnaround point for a rigid methane molecule with translation energy 93.2 kJ/mol plus twice the fall-oﬀ distance

4

of the interaction with the surface. (ii) The depth of the PES of the C–H bond is 480 kJ/mol in the gas phase, but
only 93.2 kJ/mol near the surface. The value 93.2 kJ/mol corresponds to the height of the activation barrier used in
our dissociation.25 (iii) The exponential factor is the same as for the interaction with the surface.
If we transform to normal-mode coordinates for the particular orientations, we then obtain

for the interacting bonds pointing towards the surface. α1 is as given in Table II, γ’s are given in Tables III and IV,
Ω = 1.942 · 10−1 and ω = 7.197. Fig. 1(c) shows a contour plot of the cross-section of this total anharmonic PES with
weakening C–H bond for the orientation with one hydrogen pointing towards the surface in the translational mode
X1 and the ν3 asymmetrical stretch mode X4.

4. Intramolecular potential with elongation of the C–H bond

A weakened bond generally has not only a reduced bond strength, but also an increased bond length. We include
the eﬀect of the elongation of the C–H bond length of the hydrogens that point towards the surface due to interactions
with the surface. We have redeﬁned the VMorse given in Eq. (18) and also replace it in Eq. (19) for this type of PES.
We have used the following approximations: (i) The transition state, as determined by Refs. 27,28, has a C–H bond
that is 0.54 ˚A longer than normal. This elongation should occur at the turn around point for a rigid methane molecule
with a translation energy of 93.2 kJ/mol. (ii) The exponential factor is again the same as for the interaction with the
surface.

If we transform to normal-mode coordinates for the particular orientations, then we obtain

Vshift = De

,

(22)

where α1 is as given in Table II, γ’s are given in Tables III and IV. For orientation with one hydrogen towards the
surface we obtain; S1 = 2.942 · 102 and S2 = S3 = S4 = 0, with two hydrogens; S1 = S2 = 0 and S3 = S4 = 1.698 · 102,
and with three hydrogens; S1 = 0 and S2 = S3 = S4 = 2.942 · 102. Fig. 1(d) shows a contour plot of the cross-section
of this total anharmonic PES with elongation of the C–H bond for the orientation with one hydrogen pointing towards
the surface in the translational mode X1 and the ν3 asymmetrical stretch mode X4, and Fig. 2 shows a contour plot
of a cross-section in the translational X1 and the ν1 symmetrical stretch mode X2 in the three diﬀerent orientations.
Finally we like to note that the monotonic behaviour of all PES types in the translational mode does not contradict
with the fact that the dissociative adsorption of methane is activated. The activation barrier for dissociative adsorption
in the translational mode is situated in a region with very high excitations of the stretch modes, which we do not
reach in these simulations.

C. Initial States

All initial states in the simulations start with the vibrational ground state. The initial translational part ψ(tr) is

represented by a Gaussian wave-packet,

ψ(tr)(X1) = (2πσ2)

−1/4 exp

(X1 − X0)2
4σ2

−

(cid:20)

+ iP1X1(cid:21)

,

(23)

where σ is the width of the wave-packet (we used σ = 320.248 atomic units), X0 is the initial position (we used
X0 = 11σ, which is far enough from the surface to observe no repulsion) and P1 is the initial momentum. We
performed simulations in the energy range of 32 to 96 kJ/mol. We here present only the results of 96 kJ/mol
(equivalent to P1 = 0.2704 atomic units), because they showed the most obvious excitation probabilities for VMorse.

5

We used seven natural single-particle states, 512 grid points and a grid-length of 15σ for the translational coordinate.
With this grid-width we can perform simulation with a translational energy up to 144 kJ/mol.

Gauss-Hermite discrete-variable representations (DVR)58 were used to represent the wavepackets of the vibrational
modes. We used for all simulations 5 DVR points for the ν2 bending modes and 8 DVR points for the ν4 umbrella, ν3
asymmetrical stretch, and ν1 symmetrical stretch mode for an numerical exact integration, except for the simulations
with Vshift, where we used 16 DVR points for the ν1 symmetrical stretch mode, because of the change in the equilibrium
position.

We did the simulation with one hydrogen pointing towards the surface in eight dimensions, because the ν2 bending
modes X5 and X6 do not couple with the other modes. We needed four natural single-particle states for modes X2,
X3 and X4, and just one for the others. So the number of conﬁgurations was 71 · 43 · 14 = 448. The simulation with
two hydrogens pointing towards the surface was performed in nine dimensions. One of the ν2 bending mode (X6)
does not couple with the other modes, but for the other mode X5 we needed four natural single-particle states. The
number of conﬁgurations was 71 · 44 · 14 = 1792, because we needed the same number of natural single-particle states
as mentioned above for the other modes. We needed ten dimensions to perform the simulation with three hydrogens
pointing towards the surface. We used here one natural single-particle state for the modes X5 to X10 and four natural
single-particle states for X2 to X4, which gave us 71 · 43 · 16 = 448 conﬁgurations.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

We found that the scattering is predominantly elastic. The elastic scattering probability is larger than 0.99 for all
orientations and PESs at a translational energy of 96 kJ/mol, except for the PES with Vshift and three hydrogens
pointing towards the surface for which it is 0.956. This agrees with the observation that the translation-vibration
coupling is generally small.59

If we would have wanted to determine the role of the internal vibrations from the scattering probabilities, we would
have to do quite accurate simulations. We have opted instead to look at the molecule when it hits the surface, which
enables us to obtain good results with much less costly simulations.

A. Excitation Probabilities

The surface PES has C3v (with one or three hydrogens towards the surface) or C2v symmetry (with two hydrogens
towards the surface). If we expand this PES in a Taylor-series of internal vibrations, we see that the linear terms
contain only those vibrations that transform as a1 in C3v, respectively, C2v. These are therefore easier to excite than
others; We did not ﬁnd any appreciable excitation of e modes of C3v and the a2, b1, and b2 modes of C2v.

We will not present results of the simulations with the harmonic PES, because they give almost the same excitation
probabilities as the PES with VMorse. The maximum excitation probabilities at the surface for the PES with VMorse
are given in Table V. We have observed the highest excitations for this PES in the ν4 umbrella and ν2 bending modes
in the orientation with two hydrogens, and for the ν4 umbrella mode in the orientation with three hydrogens pointing
towards the surface. The excitation probabilities for the ν1 and ν3 stretch modes at this orientations are a factor of
magnitude lower.

We have observed higher excitation probabilities for the ν1 and ν3 stretch modes in the one hydrogen orientation.
The excitation probability of the ν4 umbrella mode is here lower then for the other orientations, but still in the same
order as the stretch modes for this orientation. This can be explained by the values of the α’s of Vsurf (see Table
II) and the force constants of Vharm (see Table I), because Vharm is approximately VMorse for the ground state. The
force constants of Vintra for the ν1 symmetrical stretch stretch and ν3 asymmetrical stretch are of the same order, but
the α parameter in Vsurf in the orientation with one hydrogen pointing towards the surface for the ν3 asymmetrical
stretch is around twice as large as for the ν1 symmetrical stretch, which explains why ν3 is more excited as ν1. The
surface repulsion on the ν4 umbrella mode is even three times lower then on the ν1 symmetrical stretch mode, but the
force constant is also much lower. It results in a little more excitation of the ν4 umbrella then in the ν1 symmetrical
stretch.

For the orientation with two hydrogens pointing towards the surface the repulsion on the vibrational modes is for
all modes in the same order (ν2 bending a little higher), so the diﬀerence in excitation probabilities correlate here
primarily with the force constants. The force constants of the ν2 bending and ν4 umbrella modes are of the same
order, as are those of ν1 and ν3. The stretch force constants are higher, however, so that the excitation probabilities
are lower. The repulsion on the ν4 umbrella mode is the largest in the orientation with three hydrogens pointing

6

towards the surface. The force constants is lower for this modes then for the ν1 and ν3 stretch modes, so the primary
excitation is seen in the ν4 umbrella mode.

For the orientation with three hydrogens pointing towards the surface the repulsion on the ν4 umbrella mode is
the highest in combination with a low force constant, so this mode has a much higher excitation probability than the
ν1 and ν3 stretch modes. Another interesting detail is that the α3 parameter is higher for the orientation with two
than with three hydrogens pointing toward the surface, but the excitation probabilities for the ν4 umbrella in this
orientations are equal. This is caused by a coupling between the excitation of the ν2 bending and the ν4 umbrella
mode in the orientation with two hydrogens pointing towards the surface.

We observed with Vweak (see Table V) that all excitation probabilities become much higher than with VMorse, except
for the ν4 umbrella mode with two hydrogens towards the surface, which stays almost the same. It is caused by the
fact that, although the ν1 symmetrical stretch and ν3 asymmetrical stretch contribute almost completely to VMorse,
the ν4 umbrella does so just for a small part. The ν4 umbrella contributes primarily, and the ν2 bending completely,
to the harmonic terms of intramolecular PES Vintra. Vweak gives only a lowering in the VMorse terms of Vintra, so
we should expect primarily an higher excitation probability in the ν1 and ν3 stretch modes. This will also cause a
higher excitation probability of the other modes, because the turn-around point will be some what later, which give
eﬀectively more repulsion on the other modes.

We also observed that for both stretches the excitation probabilities shows the following trend; three hydrogens
< two hydrogens < one hydrogen pointing towards the surface. For one hydrogen pointing towards the surface the
excitation probability of the ν3 asymmetrical stretch is around twice that of the ν1 symmetrical stretch, they are
almost equal for two hydrogens, and for three hydrogens the ν1 is twice the ν3 stretch. Some of these trends can also
be found for the PES with VMorse, but are not always that obvious. They follow the same trends as the α parameters
of Vsurf in Table II.

Vshift (see Table V) gives also higher excitation probabilities for almost all modes than VMorse, but for the ν2 bending
mode in the two hydrogens pointing towards the surface orientation it became lower. This means that the repulsion
of the surface is here caused for a large part by the Vshift terms (see Eq. (22)), where the ν2 bending modes don’t
contribute. It is also in agreement with the fact that we have observed the excitation maximum earlier, so the Vsurf
repulsion on the ν2 bending modes will be lower. Fig. 1 shows that the repulsion for the PES with Vshift is stronger
than for the other three PESs.

The excitations in the ν1 and ν3 stretch modes are extremely high with Vshift, because they contribute strongly
to the C–H bond elongation. The trend in the excitation probabilities of the ν1 symmetrical stretch mode is caused
by the number of bonds pointing towards the surface, because the γi2 parameters are for all bonds and orientations
the same, so only the strength of the coupling with the shift-factor dominates. This eﬀect is illustrated in Fig. 2.
We didn’t observe this trend in the ν3 asymmetrical stretch mode, because there is also diﬀerence between the γi4
parameters as can be seen in Table III and IV.

B. Structure Deformation

If we put the methane molecule far from the surface, then all PESs are identical. For this situation we calculated a
bond distance of 1.165 ˚A and bond angle of 109.5 degrees in the ground state. The results of the maximum structure
deformations are shown in the Table VI. Fig. 3 shows the names of the bonds and angles for the three orientations.
We observed that the PESs with VMorse and Vweak give again the same trends, but that for the PES with Vweak
these trends are much stronger. This is in agreement with the observations discussed for the excitation probabilities
above. The deformations for the PES with Vshift are dominated by the change of the bond distances for the bonds
which are pointing towards the surface. These bonds become longer for all orientations in the same order. So there
is no orientational eﬀect and this will be probably caused completely by the Vshift terms (see Eq. (22)).

For the orientation with one hydrogen pointing towards the surface (see Table VI), we observed that the bond
pointing towards the surface becomes shorter, as expected, for the PES with VMorse and even more with Vweak. This
is caused by the repulsion of the Vsurf terms, which works in the direction of the bond axes. We observed also some
small bond angle deformation. This is probably a secondary eﬀect of the change in the bond distance and correlates to
excitation of the ν4 umbrella mode. Remarkably, for Vshift the bond length increases. Clearly the eﬀect of the change
in equilibrium bond length is more eﬀective than the repulsion with the surface. The shift eﬀect may be somewhat
too large, but the observed change (0.232 ˚A) is much lower than the shift of the equilibrium (0.54 ˚A) on which we
ﬁtted Vshift.

We also observed for all orientations with Vshift an earlier turn-around point, which is in agreement with the earlier
observed excitation maximum. This is caused by the extra repulsion contribution in the Vshift terms and by the longer

7

bond length; a longer bond gives a higher repulsion for the same position of the center of mass. Fig. 1 shows this
eﬀect in the ν3 asymmetrical stretch mode.

The orientation with two hydrogens pointing towards the surface (see Table VI) gives also shorter bond distances
for the bonds pointing towards the surface for the PESs with VMorse and Vweak, although very little in comparison
to the one hydrogen orientation. We expected this, because just half of the repulsion is now in the direction of the
bonds. The other half is perpendicular on the C–H bonds and this makes the bond angle larger. The bond angles
between the bonds pointing towards the surface show a quite large deformation. This was already expected from the
excitation of the ν2 bending and ν4 umbrella modes.

We also observed that a smaller bond length of the bonds pointing towards the surface correlates with a larger
bond angle of the angles between the bonds pointing towards the surface and a higher excitation probability of the
ν2 bending mode. This can be explained as follows. When the bonds become shorter the center of mass can come
closer to the surface. Because of this there will be more repulsion on the ν2 bending mode, which will cause a larger
bond angle deformation.

Most of the deformations of the other bond angles can be explained as an indirect eﬀect of the deformation of this
bond angle, but the deformation of the angle between the bonds pointing away from the surface which was seen at
the PES with Vshift must be caused by the excitation of the ν4 umbrella mode.

We observed almost no change in bond length for the PESs with VMorse and Vweak at the three hydrogens towards
the surface orientation (see Table VI). Almost all energy is absorbed by the ν4 umbrella mode, so this gives quite
large bond angle deformations. The bond angle deformation is larger for the PES with Vweak than with VMorse PES;
in agreement with higher excitation probability for the PES with Vweak. The PES with Vshift has around the same
excitation probabilities for the ν4 umbrella mode as the PES with Vweak, but the bond angle deformation is the same
as for the PES with VMorse. This may be caused by the higher excitations of the ν1 and ν3 stretch modes and the
longer bonds pointing towards the surface at the PES with Vshift, which can make it harder to deform the bond angles.

C. Dissociation models

Several dissociation mechanisms for direct methane dissociation on transition metals have been suggested. All
proposals can be related to two main ideas. One of them is the breaking of a single C–H bond in the initial collision.5,31
This model is most suggested in literature and also all wavepacket simulations have focussed on the eﬀects of this
model.25,31–34 The other mechanism is often called “splats” and suggests that the critical requirement for methane
dissociation is angular deformation of methane which allows a Ni–C bond to form.5 Even though we did not try to
describe the dissociation itself, we would like to discuss the implication of our simulation for the dissociation.

The “splats” model seems easiest to discuss. Angular deformation is related to the ν2 bending and the ν4 umbrella
mode. The excitation probabilities in Table V seem to indicate that these modes are easy to excite, and that angular
deformation should be large. These excitation probabilities are misleading, however. Table VI shows that, although
the excitation probabilities depend on the PES, the changes in the bond angles do not. Moreover, these changes are
quite small. They are largest for the orientation with two hydrogen atoms pointing towards to surface, for which they
are about 8 degrees at most. This seems much too small to enable the formation of a Ni–C bond. A previous estimate
of the bond angle deformation gave an energy of 68.1 kJ/mol to get three hydrogens and the carbon in one plane.
This correspond to a bond angle of 120 degrees.5 We ﬁnd with three hydrogens pointing towards the surface that the
bond angle only changes to about 112 degrees at the higher energy of 96 kJ/mol. The reason for this diﬀerence is that
for the older estimate it was assumed that all translational energy can be used to deform the bond angle, whereas
Tables V and VI clearly show that this is not correct.

The excitation probabilities for the stretch modes depend strongly on the orientation of the molecule and on the
PES. For the PESs without a change of the equilibrium bond length the excitation probabilities are only appreciably
with one hydrogen pointing towards the surface. This is, however, not a favourable orientation for the dissociation.
Moreover, Table VI shows that in those cases the repulsion with the surface shortens the C–H bond. The same
holds for the orientation with two hydrogens pointing towards the surface, although to a lesser extent, whereas
the bond length changes hardly at all with three hydrogens pointing towards the surface. This indicates that the
intramolecular PES needs the bond elongation to overcome the repulsion of the surface that shortens the C–H bond,
and to get dissociation. This agrees completely with electronic structure calculations that yield a late barrier for
dissociation with a very elongated C–H bond.26,35 The large excitation probabilities for the PES with the elongated
equilibrium bond length should not be over-interpreted, however. They are to be expected even if the molecule stays
in its (shifted) vibrational ground state. More telling is that for this PES we do ﬁnd at least some inelastic scattering.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

We have done wavepacket simulations on the scattering of methane from a ﬂat Ni(111) model surface with a ﬁxed
orientation with one, two, or three hydrogens pointing towards the surface. We used the MCTDH method and four
diﬀerent model PESs for each orientation. We used a translational energy of up to 96 kJ/mol and all internal vibrations
in the ground state. The scattering was in all cases predominantly elastic.

When the molecule hits the surface, we always observe vibrational excitations of the ν4 umbrella and ν2 bending
modes, especially in the orientations with two or three hydrogens pointing towards the surface. This is due to a
favorable coupling that originates from the repulsive interaction with the surface, and the low excitation energies.
Deformations of the molecule are predominantly in the bond angles. The changes in the bond angles are, however,
too small to allow for the formation of a Ni–C bond, as suggested in the “splats” model of methane dissociation.

Appreciable excitations of the ν1 and ν3 stretch modes when methane hits the surface are only observed when one
hydrogen atom points towards the surface, or when the intramolecular PES has an elongated equilibrium C–H bond
length close to the surface. The repulsion of the surface shortens the C–H bond. This can only be overcome when the
intramolecular PES incorporates the eﬀect of a longer equilibrium C–H bond length caused by overlap of occupied
surface orbitals with the antibonding orbitals of methane. This agrees with quantum chemical calculations, which
show a late barrier for dissociation.

The simulations with these model PESs show that the internal vibrations play an important role in the dissociation
mechanism. Excitation probabilities when the molecule hits the surface show how the translational energy is converted
into vibrational energy and it is distributed over the internal modes. These probabilities vary strongly with the PES.
As only few internal vibrations contribute to the dissociation, it is important to obtain more information on the real
PES for this system.

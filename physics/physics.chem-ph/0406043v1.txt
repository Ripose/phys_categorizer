(Dated: December 31, 2013)

We present a model intended for rapid sampling of ground and excited state potential energy
surfaces for ﬁrst-row transition metal active sites. The method is computationally inexpensive and
is suited for dynamics simulations where (1) adiabatic states are required ”on-the-ﬂy” and (2) the
primary source of the electronic coupling between the diabatic states is the perturbative spin-orbit
interaction among the 3d electrons. The model Hamiltonian we develop is a variant of the Anderson
impurity model and achieves eﬃciency through a physically motivated basis set reduction based on
the large value of the d-d Coulomb interaction Ud and a L´anczos matrix diagonalization routine
to solve for eigenvalues. The model parameters are constrained by ﬁts to the partial density of
states (PDOS) obtained from ab initio density functional theory calculations. For a particular
application of our model we focus on electron-transfer occuring between cobalt ions solvated by
ammonium, incorporating conﬁguration interaction between multiplet states for both metal ions.
We demonstrate the capability of the method to eﬃciently calculate adiabatic potential energy
surfaces and the electronic coupling factor we have calculated compares well to previous calculations
and experiment.

I.

INTRODUCTION

First-row transition metals (TM) complexed with or-
ganic ligands play key roles in biology and aqueous chem-
istry. Ligand exchange and electron transfer are po-
tentially rate-limiting processes that must be consid-
ered in industrial or bio-remedial chemistry [1]. Ligand
binding at the iron porphyrin active sites of heme pro-
teins are fundamental for oxygen transport and aerobic
metabolism [2]. Many of these reactions involve non-
radiative transitions between diﬀerent spin states and
require spin-orbit coupling. This interaction occurs pri-
marily on the TM atom due to the localized nature of the
3d valence electrons and most quantum chemistry codes
do not incorporate the small (∼0.05-0.1 eV) energy-scale
coupling.

In general, treatment of open-shell TM atoms is dif-
ﬁcult and many of the standard density-functional the-
ory (DFT) model chemistries such as the local density
or gradient-corrected approximations (LDA and GGA,
respectively) are known to give erroneous qualitative re-
sults in some cases [3]. The primary source of these prob-
lems are non-dynamical correlations associated with the
near-degeneracy of conﬁgurations with the Hartree-Fock
single-Slater determinant groundstate [4]. In fact, it is
clear that in the vicinity of the transition state of a charge
transfer complex such non-dynamical correlations may
be very important, much as they are in chemical bond
breaking. One may incorporate these eﬀects by higher-
order corrections such as Moller-Plesset perturbation the-
ory (MP2,MP4) or conﬁguration interaction (CI) meth-
ods such as complete active space self-consistent ﬁeld
(CASSCF), or, especially for non-dynamical correlations,
multireference conﬁguration interaction approaches[5],

but these methods are computationally prohibitive for
TM molecules containing ∼50 atoms. In many cases the
CI must be limited to single excitations, which may be
insuﬃcient[6].

While the addition of some amount of non-local ex-
change used in the hybrid Hartree-Fock/DFT methods
such as B3LYP seems to capture some of the multi-
determinantal character of TM systems [7, 8, 9], the min-
imal local Gaussian basis sets required for quantitative
accuracy are very large and the sampling required for
dynamics and the calculation of excited states is not yet
aﬀordable for most processors.

In this paper we introduce an eﬀective semi-empirical
model Hamiltonian that is well-suited for (∼50-100
atoms) TM molecules.
The problematic aspect of
strongly correlated TM systems, the (d-d Coulomb inter-
action), leads to a physically-motivated reduction of the
many-body basis set required by limiting the number of
dn conﬁgurations that must be considered. We develop
a variant of the Anderson Impurity Model (AIM), which
has had some success in describing spectra and energet-
ics of TM solid-state systems [10]. We then describe our
method of solving for the groundstate of this model us-
ing the variational ansatz for the groundstate wavefunc-
tion of Gunnarsson and Sch¨onhammer [11] and Varma
and Yafet [12]. The AIM reduces the multiple-degrees
of freedom of this problem to a small number of one-
electron and Coulomb input parameters. We show how
these parameters can be constrained and, in some cases,
directly extracted from ab initio DFT calculations. We
have done this using the SIESTA [13] code. The tensor
product basis formed from the TM 3d and ligand orbitals
results in a very large eigenvalue problem. We solve for
ground and excited states with an eﬃcient L´anczos diag-

onalization routine. This model, which is similar to the
angular-overlap model of Gerloch and co-workers [14],
diﬀers in both the physically-motivated truncation of the
basis set and also in the method of parameterization. We
seek here to identify the microscopic origin of model pa-
rameters that describe the electronic structure, such as
the d-d Coulomb repulsion and the ligand-ﬁeld splitting,
rather than focusing on structural sensitivities [15]

We now develop the model in detail and apply it to the
electron transfer reaction between Co(N H3)2+
6(aq) [Co(II)]
and Co(N H3)3+
6(aq) [Co(III)] molecules in solution, which
has been extensively investigated by ab initio electronic
structure methods [16, 17, 18].

II. THE MODEL

The TM molecules we wish to investigate are typi-
cally composed of a single 3d TM atom bound to one
or more ligands. We express the model Hamiltonian in
2nd-quantized notation using the 3d atomic orbitals of
the TM atom and the molecular orbital eigenstates of
the ligands. We have recently applied a similar model
to the study of the electronic structure of cobalt valence
tautomers [19].

The electron correlation eﬀects that we wish to incor-
porate into our model result from the localized character
of the atomic 3d-orbitals on the TM atom. The ligand
molecular orbitals will tend to be more delocalized over
several atomic sites. A set of localized atomic levels hy-
bridized to a reservoir of more extended electronic states
is well-described by an Anderson Impurity Model. We
may write down a variant of this model, speciﬁc for TM
molecules:

where ǫLi are the on-site energies for the redox-active

fermion creation operators for the ligand molecular or-
bitals. The operator d†
γσ creates an electron in the TM
3d-orbital with Oh symmetry label γ = xy, yz, xz, 3z2 −
r2, x2 − y2 and σ spin. Vγi are the hopping matrix ele-
ment between the Co 3d-orbitals and the ligand states.
We also include the 3d spin-orbit (s.o.) in its ﬁrst-order

2

perturbative form. The inclusion of the TM s.o. is signif-
icant for processes that involve changes in the total spin
of the electrons in the 3d shell.

Given the large changes in reorganization energy that
can accompany these processes, we need to couple our
model, which deals only with the valence electronic sec-
tor, to a relevant reaction coordinate, such as bond length
change. This is especially vital for biomolecules where
function is modulated by structural changes [20]. The
simplest way to couple the TM molecule to the environ-
ment is via the terms in Eqn.(4): The term gγxd†
γσdγσ
provides a (Holstein) linear coupling of the d-level charge
occupancy of the TM atom and the reaction coordinate,
the change in metal-ligand bond distance, x. At low-
est order, the potential energy surfaces are harmonic and
so we can add an energy term that is parabolic in x:
(1/2)Kx2. The linear coupling and the parabolic energy
term can both be obtained from a gradient expansion of
the hybridization about the M-L bond length minimum
[21]:

we estimate by taking the ﬁrst derivative of the ap-
propriate Slater-Koster integral [22], using a distance-

where x0 is the equilibrium bond length. This expres-
sion should be valid for small displacements away from
x0 and weak coupling between the TM d-electrons and
changes in M-L bond length. From a simple harmonic
oscillator model K is related to the single-active metal-
K/M where M is the
ligand stretching mode ω by ω =
reduced mass which may be approximated by the total
mass of all six NH3 ligands. To obtain K we refer to
experimental metal-ligand vibrational data [24].

We now show how we apply this model to a particular
system, the self-exchange electron-transfer in the cobalt
hexaammines, Co(N H3)2+/3+
6(aq)

.

III. ELECTRON-TRANSFER IN Co(N H3)2+/3+
6(aq)

A. Experimental and Theoretical Review

We would like to examine how eﬀects arising from
strong correlations manifest in the general problem of
electron transfer between solvated 1st-row transition
metal ions that are mediated by a ligand bridge. In par-
ticular, we focus on the electron self-exchange rate in

the cobalt hexaammine system Co(N H3)2+/3+
6(aq)
given by the following reaction:

, which is

Co(N H3)2+

6(aq) + Co(N H3)3+

6(aq)

ket⇋

Co(N H3)3+

6(aq) + Co(N H3)2+

6(aq)

(4)

and the reasons why ket is two orders of magnitude larger
than predicted. Experimental measurements of the rate
(ket ∼10−6-10−5 M−1s−1) [25] deem the reaction adi-
abatic, i.e. where the electron transmission coeﬃcient
κ ≈ 1, while previous theoretical eﬀorts (ket ∼10−8
M−1s−1) yield κel << 1 [26]. Electronic structure eﬀects
can be important for ET between small TM complexes in
solution (which we deﬁne to be the metal ion and the six
coordinating ligands of the ﬁrst solvation shell) that are
in contact with each other. In the case of the hexaam-
mines, the salient feature appears to be a ”spin barrier”,
(ﬁrst pointed out by Orgel [27]). During the course of
the transfer process, each cobalt ion must change its spin
by ∆S = 3/2. Strictly speaking, ket should be zero, but
various schemes have been proposed to show why the rate
is, in fact, almost adiabatic.

6

The model for the electron-transfer process is usually
treated as two cobalt ions (one Co(II) valence, the other
Co(III)) that are each surrounded by their primary solva-
tion shells which consist of six octahedrally-coordinated
NH3 groups. The ET between the Co(NH3)2+/3+
com-
plexes is generally believed to be an outer-sphere pro-
cess, so the ligands act as a bridge that the tunnelling
electron delocalizes over during the reaction. The redox-
active orbitals of the ammine ligands are the highest
occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs) of the ammines
which have σ symmetry and hybridize strongly with the
cobalt eg orbitals [28]. The strong σ-donating ability of
the ammine ligand has been conﬁrmed by NMR stud-
ies which observe the kinetic stability of this complex
through the rate of water exchange of Co(NH3)2+/3+
.
This rate for Co(NH3)2+/3+
is a factor of ∼106 slower
6
than for Co(H2O)2+/3+
[1].

6

The ET reaction can be reduced to a unimolecular pro-
cess by consideration of the encounter complex, which
is formed by the van der Waals contact of the two pri-
mary coordination shells of the metal ions. This can
be done in a variety of orientations [29]. The two most
commonly considered are the (1) apex-to-apex, which in-
volves contact along the C4 axis, and is the most opti-
mal bridge since the 1s orbitals of the hydrogen atoms
of the two ammines in close-contact show large mixing,
and (2) face-to-face, which has two faces perpendicular
to the C3 body-diagonal. The ammine contact is proba-
bly not as good here but there are 6 ammines in contact
instead of 2. For calculation of ket and HDA, some aver-
aging over diﬀerent orientations should be done to give a
more realistic estimates of these quantities. We do not do
that here, only focusing on the most optimal geometry,
apex-to-apex. Given this ﬁxed geometry, we investigate
electronic structure eﬀects.

FIG. 1: Lowest energy conﬁgurations and excited states for
Co2+ and Co3+ valences. These are the relevant electronic
states for the self-exchange electron transfer reaction between
cobalt atoms in Co(NH3)2+/3+
. The question mark for the
Co2+ excited state refers to an estimate by Buhks, et al. at
the equlibrium conﬁguration.

6

Buhks et al.

[26] ﬁrst noted that the groundstate-
to-groundstate electron-transfer between the low-spin
Co(III) ion (3d6)(1A1) and the high-spin Co(II) ion
(3d7)(4T1) is spin-forbidden and the reaction must pro-
ceed through the S = 1/2 2E excited state for Co(II) or
the S = 1 3T1 and 3T2 of Co(III). They also showed that
there is a non-zero s.o. coupling matrix element between
these ground and excited states, so the groundstates
are not single-determinant but show small admixture to
these excited states. Thermal population of these excited
conﬁgurations is an open issue [16, 17, 18]. The vertical
energy separation between 1A1 and 3T1 for Co(III) is
very large (∼14,000 cm−1) and well-established by ex-
periment. On the other hand, the separation between
4T1 and 2E for Co(II) has been estimated from semi-
empirical INDO/CI calculations to be 3000-9000 cm−1
[16]. While the existence of low-spin Co(III) has been
experimentally veriﬁed, no such conﬁrmation exists for
high-spin Co(II). Thus, appreciable population of the 2E
may yet be a viable possibility. Also, it should be noted
that these values have been estimated for the equilibrium
conﬁguration. The relevant values for the energy separa-
tion should be made at the transition state, where they
will be signiﬁcantly reduced. This discussion is summa-
rized in Fig.(1).

Other theoretical work, most notably by Newton [28]
and Sutin [30], who used ab initio self-consistent ﬁeld,
spin-restricted Hartree-Fock to calculate the electronic
coupling matrix element HDA, assumed 2E as the Co(II)
groundstate. Newton obtained a value of 940 cm−1 for
the spin-allowed electron transfer. He then used a reduc-
tion factor of 2 X 10−2 to account for the 2nd-order spin-
orbit coupling, obtaining a value of 20 cm−1 for the 4T1
to 1A1 process which corresponds to a κ ≃ 4.0 X 10−3.

Furthermore, Newton considered diﬀerent orientations
for the encounter complex, such as apex-to-apex, edge-
to-edge, and face-to-face, which will alter hybridization-
matrix elements and diﬀer in the number of bridging lig-
ands (2, 4, 6, respectively).

Newton, in a more recent paper [18], calculated the
relative energies of 4T1 and 2E electronic conﬁgura-
tions of Co(II) and the 1A1, 3T1 of Co(III) using un-
restricted Hartree-Fock (UHF) and second-order Møller-
Plesset (UMP2). He recalculated HDA and κ for the
apex-to-apex geometry using these semi-empirical CI
methods that take into account electron correlations at
the level of 2nd-order Brillouin-Wigner perturbation the-
ory. For the groundstate pathway, 4T1/1A1 →1A1/4T1
he obtains a values (HDA = 9.5 cm−1, κ = 1.2 X 10−3)
which are optimal in the sense that the 3z2 − r2 - NH3
σ-HOMO hybridization can only decrease in other ge-
ometries. He estimates the eﬀect of orientational aver-
aging by taking into account a multiplicative factor 0.1;
¯κel ∼0.1(κel)apex−to−apex so ¯κel ∼10−4, still falling 2 or-
ders of magnitude short of explaining the observed re-
sults.

B. Many-Electron Basis Set

We use the model Hamiltonian of Eqn.(1), which in-
volves use of an ansatz for the groundstate wavefunc-
tion with the coeﬃcients to be determined variation-
ally. The wavefunction is composed of the lowest-lying
single-determinants in the many-electron Hilbert space,
where the truncation of the space is dictated by energet-
ics. Our problem therefore reduces to diagonalizing the
model Hamiltonian in a restricted Hilbert space. We ﬁrst
considered the two nominal valences for each cobalt hex-
ammine reactant. In each case the most signiﬁcant states
are the high-spin and low-spin state, the spin-orbit ex-
cited states, and states that couple by hole transport to
the bridging NH3 HOMO. For Co(NH3)2+
6 we use the
groundstate 4T1, which is the three-fold degenerate hs-
3d7. The spin-orbit state is, as stated above, ls-3d7. Each
of the manifolds couples to respective hole-transfer states
which are labeled by Oh irreps of the 3d electron sector
3A2, 1A1, 1E, 3T1, and 3T2 of the 3d8 conﬁguration on
the cobalt atom. Due to suppression of d9 occupancy by
Ud, we restrict the Hilbert space to the one-hole sector
on the ligands. The states we retain as our basis gives a
total of 65 states.
For Co(NH3)3+

6 , we consider the following 3d6 states:
The experimentally observed groundstate conﬁguration
1A1, and the states that couples via spin-orbit coupling
3T1, 3T2. We would like to observe the suppression of the
d8 conﬁguration, so we include many more hole-transfer
states for this calculation. For the 3d7L states we have
2E and 4T1. We also include the two-hole states (3d8L2)
3A2, 1A1, 1E, 3T1, and 3T2, where the hole-degeneracies
are fully taken into account, giving us 376 states. For
the case of both the 2+ and 3+ valences, we assume the

4

truncation of the basis set is justiﬁed by the suppression
of all other dn conﬁgurations by Ud and all other spin
states by the Hund’s rule exchange interaction Jd.

The basis sets and the quantum weight distribution for
Co(NH3)2+
are shown in Fig.(6). The
6
next section discusses how parameters were obtained for
our model.

and Co(NH3)3+

C. Determination of model parameters

Most of our model parameters are extracted from sin-
gle complex calculations with the fully ab initio code
SIESTA [13] based on density functional theory (DFT).
Before discussing the procedure in detail, we brieﬂy want
to introduce this code. Nevertheless we want to stress
that our way of determining the parameters is quite gen-
eral and independent of the code one uses as long as it
has certain features such as a local atomic basis set and
the projected density of states (PDOS).

In running SIESTA we used Troullier-Martins norm-
in the Kleinman-
conserving pseudo potentials [31]
Bylander form [32].
For cobalt, we included spin-
polarization and non-linear core corrections [33] to ac-
count for a spin-dependent exchange splitting and cor-
relation eﬀects between core and valence electrons, re-
spectively. Relativistic eﬀects are included for the core
electrons in the usual scalar-relativistic approximation
(mass-velocity and Darwin terms) and by averaging over
spin-orbit coupling terms, while no spin-orbit coupling
is included for the 4s and 3d valence electrons. Hence
spin stays a good quantum number. SIESTA uses a lo-
cal basis set of pseudo atomic orbitals (PAO) of multiple
ζ-type. The ﬁrst-ζ orbitals are produced by the method
by Sankey and Niklewski [34], while the higher-ζ orbitals
are obtained from the split valence method well known
from quantum chemistry. Polarization orbitals can also
be included. We used a double-ζ basis set with polariza-
tion orbitals (DZP), as well as the generalized gradient
approximation (GGA) in the version by Perdew, Burke
and Ernzerhof [35] for the exchange-correlation energy
functional. As for the single complex calculations the
structures were optimized with the conjugate gradient
method untill the forces on each atom were below a tol-
erance of 0.01eV /˚A.

We ﬁrst discuss the estimation of the following param-
eters, the d-d Coulomb repulsion Ud, Hund’s coupling
Jd, bare (undressed) d-orbital energy level ǫd, the ligand
energy level ǫL, the ligand-ﬁeld (purily due to electro-
statics) ∆o, and 10Dq which contains contributions from
both electrostatics and hybridization. In order to get a
physical picture of the single complex problem we show
the PDOS (DOS projected on atomic 4s, 3 t2g and 3 eg)
of Co(III) in ﬁgure 2 as well as Co(II, spin-up) in ﬁgure
3 and Co(II, spin-down) in ﬁgure 4. All states below the
Fermi energy ǫF (set to zero) are occupied. One can im-
mediately see the 10Dq energy gap between t2g and the
anti-bonding ˜e∗
g orbitals due to the approximately octra-

hedral symmetry. The π-symmetric t2g orbitals hardly
hybridize with the σ-symmetric HOMO of N H3 while
the σ-symmetric eg orbitals form bonding ˜eg and anti-
bonding ˜e∗
g molecular orbitals (MOs). For further clariﬁ-
cation this is schematically illustrated in ﬁgure 5. As for
Co(II) the non-vanishing total spin (S=3/2) introduces
spin-dependent MOs due to Hund’s coupling, and the
partly occupied t2g orbitals split probably due to rhom-
bic distortions. Interestingly, the eg weights are of simi-
lar magnitude in the bonding ˜eg and the antibonding ˜e∗
g
MOs. This indicates the near degeneracy of the eg and
ligand energy level ǫd (HOMO of N H3). In the case of
Co(II, spin-up) [see Fig. 3] they are exactly degenerate
which provides the ligand energy level ǫ2+
g + ˜eg)
immidiately. The t2g and 10Dq energies of Co(II/III) can
be read oﬀ the PDOS, too. In the case of Co(II) we use
the weighted average of the t2g peaks. The remaining
parameters are estimated as follows.

L = 0.5(˜e∗

In order to get the ligand energy level ǫ3+

L of Co(III)
we use a simple two-level approximation to describe the
mixing of the Co-NH3 levels. In matrix form this is

eg V
V ǫL (cid:19)

,

(cid:18)

(5)

where V is the hybridization between the Co eg levels
and the ammine level ǫL. Setting the two eigenvalues
of Eq. (5) equal to ˜eg and ˜e∗
g and also constraining the
coeﬃcients of the eigenvectors by the weights from the
PDOS in ﬁgure 2, we obtain ǫ3+
L (as well as V and eg).
The Coulomb parameters were obtained from a crude
mapping assumed between the Kohn-Sham energies ob-
tained from the GGA calculation and a mean-ﬁeld calcu-
lation, where we make use of the single-particle energies
of the Co t2g levels

where ǫd is the bare energy (without any electron-electron
interaction), Ndσ are the number of 3d electrons with spin
σ, Nd is the total number of d-electrons, and ∆0 is the
Madelung (point-charge) contribution to the ligand ﬁeld.
We can write down three equations of this kind, one for
Co(III) (spin-independent) and two for Co(II) (one for
spin-up and another one for spin-down), and can solve
for the three unknowns ǫd, Ud, and Jd. The required
parameter ∆o can be otained as follows.

Since we know the t2g energies from the PDOS we need
to know the eg energies in order to determine the electro-
static contribution ∆o = eg − t2g for Co(II) and Co(III).
These can be extracted in a straightforward way by look-
ing sharply at ﬁgure 5 which summarizes all the involved
quantities. From the center ¯ǫ = 0.5(˜eg + ˜e∗
g) of the bond-
ing ˜eg and anti-bonding ˜e∗
g MOs and the knowledge of
the ligand energy level ǫL we otain eg = ¯ǫ + (¯ǫ − ǫL). The
resulting point charge contributions to the total ligand-
ﬁeld 10Dq are small, ∆2+
o = 0.1eV .

o = 1.1eV and ∆3+

5

This is because DFT seems to be biased towards form-
ing rather extended MOs due to an improper treatment
of the on-site repulsion among d electrons leading to the
well-known deﬁciency of over-binding [7].
It does not
seem to be surprising that ∆2+
since due to a
0.2˚A shorter Co-N bond length in the case of Co(III) the
hybridization is even larger than for Co(II). Within DFT
the 10Dq of Co(III) is mainly due to hybridization.

o > ∆3+
o

The ability of an electron to transfer from one cobalt
ion to the other relies on the hybridization between the
HOMO’s on the two bridging ligands, which is estimated
from the splitting of the HOMO peaks of a two 2 ammine
calculation. The ammines are in the apex-to-apex orien-
tation. The splitting of the HOMO corresponds to 2tinter
where we deﬁne tinter to be the inter complex NH3-NH3
hopping integral. A similar procedure was applied to ob-
tain the intra complex NH3-NH3 hopping integral tintra
between ammines of the same complex allowing holes to
delocalize among the ligands. The Co − N H3 hybridiza-
tion V was determined by computing the expectation val-
ues < x2 − y2/z2|H|HOM O > for Co(II) and Co(III) us-
ing the HOMO wavefunction from a single ammine and
the Hamiltonian matrix of a single complex calculation.
Contributions to the hybridization from direct overlap
of non-orthogonal d and HOMO wavefunctions were ne-
glected.

Finally, we determine the phonon-coupling constant g
and the spring constant K as already outlined in section
II. According to Eq. (3) g depends on the Slater-Koster
parameter ηpdσ.
It is determined by setting Vpdσ = V
from the DFT method. As for K we use the experimental
Co-ligand stretching frequencies, 357cm−1 for Co(II) and
494cm−1 for Co(III) [36].

The parameters are summarized in Table I. Therefore
we can write down an eﬀective Hamiltonian that includes
only these frontier orbitals: the set of Co 3d orbitals
and the NH3 HOMO states. We use the Hamiltonian of
Eq.(1) as the eﬀective Hamiltonian for each of the sin-
gle cobalt hexaammine complexes, the 2+ and 3+ nom-
inal valences. The d-electron parameters ǫd, Ud, Jd, the
ligand-ﬁeld splitting 10Dq, etc. all refer to the cobalt 3d
electrons, while the ligand label L refers to the ammine
HOMO. We would like to solve for the groundstates of
Co(NH3)2+/3+

within this model.

IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

A. Quantum weights of single complexes

The model Hamiltonian we constructed is diagonalized
on the many-electron basis we have described using the
set of parameters presented in Table I. We show the re-
sults in Fig.(6).

For Co(NH3)2+

6 , there is 71.5% in the hs-3d7 (4T1)
state and 28.1% in the corresponding 3d8L2 where an
electron has transferred from the NH3 HOMO to the eg
shell of the Co atom. This weight is actually distributed

with ∼5% on each of the six coordinated ammine lig-
ands. This distribution of quantum weight is due to the
NH3-NH3 hybridization we included on our model. One
may picture the hole as delocalized or smeared over the
ﬁrst solvation shell. The fact that only a small fraction of
the hole resides on any one ligand has important implica-
tions for the charge-transfer process and we will discuss
this later. The remainder of the quantum weight resides
in the ls-3d7 (2E), which is small since it mixes into the
groundstate by the weak spin-orbit coupling. The verti-
cal energy separation E(2E−4T1) is 1.18 eV (9513 cm−1),
which is in good agreement with ab initio calculations.

experiment (∼1.7 eV) for the set of parameters. A pa-
rameter that we have some freedom with is the ligand-
ﬁeld splitting 10Dq. The lack of constraint on 10Dq
emerges from the model not taking proper account of
all of the contributions to the ligand-ﬁeld energy split-
ting. 10Dq is composed of the point-charge ligand-ﬁeld
∆0 and a contribution due to the hybridization of the
cobalt and ligand orbitals. While the model does take
into account the most important hybridization between
the eg and ammine HOMO, it does not actually form
bonding/anti-bonding pairs since the 3d electron sector

FIG. 6: Many-body groundstates of Co(NH3)3+
and
Co(NH3)2+
6 . The quantum weights are the squared expan-
sion coeﬃcients of the groundstate eigenvector | αi |2 on the
restricted Hilbert space. The red arrows indicate states that
would couple through the bridge Hamiltonian. The blue ar-
rows show coupling through the spin-orbit term. There are
65 basis states for Co(NH3)2+

6 and 376 for Co(NH3)3+
6 .

6

of our basis set is represented in the atomic orbital basis,
i.e. the eg levels are just the atomic orbitals, so in the
current treatment we cannot accurately predict the hy-
bridization contribution. Therefore, we treat the ligand-
ﬁeld splitting as a free-parameter in our model. While
the 10Dq value seems to work well for Co(NH3)2+
it does
not reproduce the correct vertical energy separation be-
tween low-spin and S = 1 3d6, so by increasing it by 1
eV to 3.55 eV, we recover the vertical energy from ex-
periment. The eﬀect on the weights is to shift ∼5% from
ls-3d7 to ls-3d6, as would be expected.

6

We now need to determine if and how the eﬀects of cor-
relation between the d electrons manifest in this system.
For Co(NH3)3+
6 , the hole seems nearly fully delocalized
between the ﬁrst coordination sphere of ammines and the
cobalt 3d shell with 51% in the ls-3d6 (1A1) conﬁguration

7

and 42% in the ls-3d7L states. This weight is divided up
with ∼7% per state with a hole localized in one of the six
NH3 HOMO’s. At ﬁrst glance, the physical picture ap-
pears to be very much like the screening cloud associated
with the Kondo eﬀect.
In the case of cerium materi-
als, the hole left behind from an electron hopping from
the conduction band to the 4f impurity delocalizes over
the entire continuum of conduction states, dynamically
screening the local moment and leading to the formation
of the singlet bound state.

We cannot say if the appreciable hole-weight delocal-
ized over the ligands is due to mixed valence state or
not. Both the ls-3d6(1A1) and ls-3d7(2E) states possess
ﬁlled diamagnetic t2g shells, so the Hund’s rule exchange
contribution to the d-d Coulomb interaction is equal in
each case. Since we only have two conﬁgurations, we may
shift the Fermi level to correspond with the ls-3d7, there-
fore we do not have to refer to Ud. From this perspec-
tive, the delocalization of the hole between metal 3d and
the ammine orbital looks simply like the consequence of
single-particle covalency. This interpretation is also con-
sistent with the composition of molecular orbitals from
our ab initio calculations which show nearly equal con-
tributions from metal and ligand orbitals in the (eg-σ)
bonding/anti-bonding pair.

However, there does seem to be an analogy between
the d6, d7L, and d8L2 conﬁgurations of Co(NH3)3+
and
6
the conﬁgurations f 0, f 1L, and f 2L2 of the mixed va-
lence rare-earth compounds such as CeO2 and metallic
α-Ce, where mixed valence has been established. In both
the transition metal and lanthanide cases these multiple
conﬁgurations mix into the groundstate because of their
near-degeneracy. In both cases there is also large sup-
pression of the two ligand-hole states due to the Hubbard-
U Coulomb repulsion of electrons on the localized im-

and the ligand hole L can form an exciton-like bound-
state that preserves the symmetry of the diamagnetic f 0
state, i.e. a spin-singlet state with no orbital moment.
In Co(NH3)3+
6 , we would have a similar energy lowering
associated with freezing out the 2-fold orbital degeneracy
of the eg shell and the spin-degree of freedom, antiferro-
magnetically coupled to the hole delocalized over the six
NH3 HOMO levels.

Such a state usually forms if the singly-occupied con-
ﬁguration is slightly lower in energy than the empty
level. This requirement is not satisﬁed in Co(NH3)3+
6
since the diamagnetic 3d6 state is stabilized by 1.6 eV
with respect to the ls-3d7 conﬁguration. However, the
hybridization between the eg and ammine HOMO’s are
large enough (∼2-3 eV) to mitigate this energy gap. In
CeO2 the partial occupancy of the 4f -level is observed
to be ∼0.6, consistent with the lattice volumes that are
somewhat shorter than expected for Ce3+ compounds. In
Co(NH3)3+
6 , if this type of partial occupancy exists (∼0.5
from our model calculation), experimentalists should ob-
serve bond lengths that are somewhere intermediate be-
and Co(NH3)3+
tween those expected for Co(NH3)2+
6 .

For Co(NH3)2+

6 , as stated above, the values for the
single-particle Co 3d and ammine HOMO energies are
such that there is almost complete resonance, and molec-
ular orbitals are constructed with ∼50% of each type of
orbital. We observe in our calculated result the eﬀect of
the large Ud in suppressing the 3d8 weight so the admix-
ture is now on the order of ∼70% of the hole is localized
in the d shell, while ∼30% is delocalized over the am-
mine ligands. This suppression of 3d8 conﬁgurations is
expected. The question is what consequence do these ef-
fects have on the electron transfer matrix element HDA.

6 and Co(NH3)3+
6

We performed calculations of the groundstates for the
single Co(NH3)2+
complexes. We would
now like to use the basis sets of both of these complexes to
form an encounter complex that represents the reactants
in the electron-transfer process.

We connect the single 2+/3+ complexes in the apex-
to-apex orientation through a bridge composed of am-
mines from each molecule, which gives us the Hamilto-
nian

H = h1 + h2 − t

(c†

LAσcRAσ + h.c.)

(7)

Xσ

Both h1 and h2 refer to the identical model Hamilto-
nian for each single complex given by Eqn.(1). The third
term describes hole tunneling through the ligand bridge
composed of the two ammines in close contact. The cre-
ation operator c†
LAσ refers to the creation of a σ-spin hole
on the left NH3 ligand (belonging to Co(NH3)3+
6 ) and
c†
RAσ is the corresponding operator for the right ammine
(belonging to Co(NH3)2+
6 ). The hopping integral t can
be estimated by noting that 2t is approximately the en-
ergy splitting between the bonding/anti-bonding orbitals
formed from the HOMO of each of the two bridging NH3,
oriented by close contact of the hydrogen atoms of each
ammine. We must now solve for the groundstate using
the appropriate basis set. We construct this by taking
a tensor product of our basis sets for Co(NH3)2+
and
6
Co(NH3)3+
6 . The basis set is doubled to account for ex-
changing Co(NH3)2+
6 and Co(NH3)3+
in space. There is
6
then another multiplication by two in order to treat the
Hermitian matrix in order to use diagonalization routines
suited for real, symmetric matrices [37]. So the basis set
is then of rank

N = 376 × 65 × 2 × 2 = 97760.

(8)

Given that most routines scale as ∼ N 3, where N is the
dimensionality of the Hilbert space, conventional rou-
tines, even on very fast machines (∼4 GHz micropro-
cessor) would make single-point calculations very time-
consuming. Given that we would like to sample the 2D
groundstate energy surface as a function of the breathing

tion needed to accurately determine the transition state,
we need very eﬃcient matrix diagonalizer. Plotting this
potential energy surface is a computationally intensive
problem.

The solution was to implement a L´anczos matrix-
diagonalization routine, which scales as order N [38] since
it involves only matrix-vector multiplication for sparse
matrices. The L´anczos algorithm converts a large N × N
matrix into a tridiagonal m × m matrix (m ≤ M ).
It
uses a three-term recurrence relationship which requires
one trial groundstate vector to start the sequence. The
eigenvectors tend to become parallel during iteration of
the procedure. Since we are not interested in them for
this application, a costly (∼ N 3) reorthogonalization step
does not have to be implemented.

the hexaammine cobalt complex. The donor surface
D for the ET corresponds to the encounter complex
Co(NH3)3+

the parabola in the upper left corner. The acceptor
surface A is that of Co(NH3)2+
5 (NH3)-(H3N)Co(NH3)3+
5
and is the lower right parabola in Fig.(7). The transition
state is the cusp feature at x=0.44˚A and corresponds to a
narrowly-avoided crossing between the D and A diabatic
surfaces. The electronic coupling opens a gap equal to
2| HDA | between D and A at the crossing point, where
HDA is the electronic coupling factor.

The general method of extracting HDA is as follows:
We ﬁnd the TS by plotting the energy along the diag-
onal x in Fig.(7) with high resolution. The TS is the
saddlepoint at x=0.44˚A. We then read oﬀ the diﬀerence
between the ﬁrst excited and ground states. HDA is half
of this diﬀerence.

On the other hand, one can exploit that HDA is also a
groundstate property. Instead of calculating the exicted
state, one can obtain it from calculating the energy dif-
ference between the groundstate adiabatic surface eval-
ulated at the TS and the avoided crossing between the
diabatic D and A surfaces that results when the bridge
hopping integral t is turned oﬀ.

In Fig.(10) we plot a cross-section of PES from Fig.(9)
along the reaction coordinate d = xL-xR in the region
of the TS. The energy splittings (2| HDA |) between the
groundstate E0 and ﬁrst excited state E1 at the TS (0˚A)
is ≃2 cm−1. The splitting between E1 and E2 at d=-
2.8×10−4˚A has a similar value. The splittings between
E0 and E1 and also E1 and E2 originate from lifting of
the degeneracy of the components of the 4T1 irreducible
representation of Co(II) by the spin-orbit coupling.

Our result (∼2 cm−1) is smaller than Newton’s calcu-
lation of HDA, which gave 9.5 cm−1 from ab initio calcu-

9

lations. We have essentially reproduced this calculation
from our simpler model. What the reduction of | HDA |
implies is that the correlation eﬀects we have observed in
the single complexes of cobalt hexaammine do not seem
to enhance the ET rate. The reason is that we still rely on
states that couple through the spin-orbit coupling, most
noticeably ls-3d7(2E) for the Co(NH3)2+
complex. The
6
quantum weight of this state in the groundstate is not
increased by the correlation-induced suppresion of 3d8
occupancy. In fact, this suppression tends to reduce the
magnitude of HDA. The arrows in Fig.(2) indicate that

V. CONCLUSIONS

We have introduced a variant of the Anderson Im-
purity Model that is appropriate for describing the va-
lence electronic structure of TM molecules. We have
coupled this model to a metal-ligand stretching mode.
We have applied this model to investigate the eﬀect of
strong correlations among the cobalt 3d electrons on the
self-exchange electron transfer rate in the cobalt hexam-
mines Co(NH3)2+/3+

.

6

We have constrained the model parameters by using
the results of ab initio density functional theory cal-
culations and experimental stretching frequencies. The
single-particle hybridizations VdL were extracted directly
and the Coulomb parameters (ǫd,Ud,Jd) were obtained
from mapping to a mean-ﬁeld solution of our model. Us-
ing these parameters, we found the groundstates of both
2+ and 3+ nominal valences. For the Co(NH3)3+
state
6
we ﬁnd strong conﬁgurational admixture between the 3d6
and 3d7L states. The hole L is fully delocalized between
the cobalt atom and the ﬁrst coordination sphere of am-
mines. While this resembles the screening cloud and par-
tial occupancy of the impurity level seen in mixed valent
compounds like CeO2, the large 3d7L weight could simply
be a purely single-particle eﬀect since the delocalization
is consistent with the equal metal and ligand orbital com-
position of molecular orbitals near the Fermi level from
the DFT calculation. For Co(NH3)2+
there is an obvious
6
signature of the eﬀect of large Ud, with a suppression of
∼20% of the quantum weight on 3d8L2 states.

We couple the complexes together by a bridging Hamil-
tonian to form the encounter complex and generate a
basis set by using the tensor product of the single hex-
aammine basis states. This gives a very large eigenvalue
problem (N ≃105) that is solved using L´anczos meth-
ods. The groundstate energy surface is plotted, resolving
the two minima of the electron transfer process. We are
able to extract the electronic coupling HDA as the energy
lowering at the transition state, relative to the diabatic
surfaces. What we found is that conﬁgurational admix-
ture does not enhance HDA and we get a result ∼4 cm−1,
that is within a factor of 5 of Newton’s original calcula-

10

tion.

6

It appears that the disparity of two orders of mag-
nitude in the self-exchange electron transfer rate of
Co(NH3)2+/3+
cannot be explained on the basis of the
electronic structure of a single complex. One aspect that
has been completely ignored in this calculation are sol-
vation eﬀects beyond the ﬁrst coordination shell. While
one would expect, in the gas phase, that the single, sym-
metric breathing coordinate would be an excellent ap-
proximation to the breathing coordinate, solvent eﬀects
could signiﬁcantly change the heigth of the barrier by
adding anharmonicity to the potential wells. This could
contribute to the adiabatic nature of the reaction.

Another possible source of enhancement for the ET
rate could be through dynamical eﬀects. The dynami-
cal prefactor depends on the details of how the system
crosses and recrosses the thermal barrier. The presence
of the low-lying spin-orbit states that are separated from
the groundstate by very small (∼1 cm−1) energies could
give the vibronic wavepacket multiple channels for reach-
ing the other minimum. This is a possibility that can be
explored with our model, which provides fast ”on-the-
ﬂy” sampling of the correct electronic structure. Excited
state calculations of the bimetallic TM active site involv-
ing open-shell states, coupled by the TM atom spin-orbit
interaction, would be very diﬃcult to do with state-of-
the-art quantum chemistry codes.

our calculation and Newton’s UMP2 calculationi[18] the
electron correlation eﬀects actually reduce the transition
rate. Within our variational state treatment the reason
is clear: Coulombic blocking eﬀects eliminate a class of
determinants which can facilitate charge transfer. It will
be interesting to explore the eﬀects of correlations upon
the intermediate spin manifold of states.

The method proposed in this paper could be applied
to other TM systems such as the active sites in metallo-
proteins. More elaborate ways of coupling the electronic
sector to the protein structure will have to be devised
but the eﬃciency and simplicity of our method might be
very useful in identifying transition state conﬁgurations.

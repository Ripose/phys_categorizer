A new measure of the crystal-ﬁeld strength, complementary to the conventional one, is deﬁned.
k Bk0|av, k = 2, 4, 6, of the crystal-(ligand)-ﬁeld
HCF parametrizations, i.e. on the axial CF parameters modules averaged over all
reference frame orientations. They turn out to be equal to
|HCF|av, respectively. While
H
the traditional measure is established on the parametrization modules or on the second moment of
the CF energy levels, the introduced scale employs rather the ﬁrst moment of the energy modules
and has better resolving power. The new scale is able to diﬀerentiate the strength of various
iso-modular parametrizations according to the classes of rotationally equivalent parametrizations.
Using both the compatible CF strength measures one may draw more accurate conclusions about
the Stark levels arrays and particularly their total splitting magnitudes.

Solid state experimentalists, especially spectroscopists, still need a reliable scale quantitatively char-
acterizing the eﬀect of crystal-ﬁeld interaction, i.e. deﬁning the so-called crystal-ﬁeld strength. Such a
parameter could directly verify and compare various parametrizations of the crystal-ﬁeld Hamiltonian
HCF, which may come from diﬀerent ﬁttings experimental data when the orientations of reference
frames associated with these parametrizations are unknown in the majority of cases.
Although such a conventional scale for measuring the strength of the crystal-ﬁeld has been already
introduced over twenty years ago [1,2], in some cases it seems to be insuﬃciently precise. It employs the

Both the parameters Sk and S themselves are not a direct measure of the real magnitude of
the initial state splitting, since the crystal-ﬁeld eﬀect depends also on the properties of an object
(a paramagnetic ion) upon which the
HCF
perturbation reﬂects the symmetry of the electron density distribution of the central ion open-shell.
For instance, an S-type ion like Gd3+ feels no crystal ﬁeld (in the ﬁrst order of perturbation) no
matter how strong is the surrounding ﬁeld.

The eﬀect of splitting can be most simply expressed by the so-called second moments σ2

HCF which distinguish the whole classes of the rotationally equivalent

the CF sublevels within the initial state upon switching on the
HCF) perturbation. In fact,
the second moment is easily represented by the scalar crystal-ﬁeld strength parameters, either Sk or S
(k)
(section 2). However, although the eﬀective
CF multipoles (for k = 2, 4, 6) contribute to the energy
of individual Stark levels independently (as an algebraic sum), the simple linear relations between σ2

k (or S2) are always fulﬁlled. As it is proved these relations strongly conﬁne both the

Moreover the actual crystal ﬁeld splittings ∆E can be additionally restricted (section 5). Naturally,
HCF parametrizations correspond to the same crystal-ﬁeld strengths Sk and S.

However, apart from the modules Mk and M , there exist also other rotational invariants of the
or
HCF parameterizations, in
other words the parameterizations referring to the same real crystal-ﬁeld potential, but expressed in
variously oriented reference frame. Interestingly, the new invariants turn out to be the average values

of the axial parameter modulus

HCF obtained after the averaging over all orientations of the reference frame, i.e. over the solid angle

CF|av and
the modulus of their sum are just equal to
The new scale of the crystal-ﬁeld strength based on the above invariants is in principle consistent
with the conventional one but it reveals more resolving power. Applying the new measure to the
iso-modular parametrizations may lead to diﬀerent strength parameters what is exempliﬁed below
for several cases (section 5). The introduced more subtle strength gradation established rather on
the ﬁrst moment of the sublevel energy modules gives, comparing to the second moment, additional
HCFs, including the magnitude of
information about the Stark levels array for various iso-modular

2. Conventional deﬁnition of the crystal-ﬁeld strength parameter

The comparison and scaling of the crystal-ﬁeld impact can be based upon the two types of scalar
quantities, Mk and/or M , since both of them are rotationally invariant. A scalar crystal-ﬁeld strength
parameter of this kind was given ﬁrstly by Auzel and Malta [1,2] as (in original notation):

They can be compared with each other only after proper recalculation. Since both these quantities are
independent of the assumed axis system they allow to check whether the original CFP data sets and
the transformed ones are compatible. The strengths Sk or S enable also a broad comparison of CFP
data sets when the axis systems have not been explicitly deﬁned, and undoubtedly they play a central
role in the CF theory. What is also important and useful they are linked to the second moment of the

which is here of order of n = 2J + 1. All its coeﬃcients and roots must be real what follows obvi-
ously from the
HCF hermiticity. Interestingly, some characteristics of the sublevels spectrum may be
described in terms of the elementary algebra. Firstly, as the energy center of gravity of the initial

The problem becomes more complex for the global crystal-ﬁeld strength S (Eq.2), since then the
components S2
2 (Eq.4). This is why there is
i
no straightforward proportionality between σ2 and S2 in this case. Nevertheless σ is a positively
HCF 2k-poles into σ2
deﬁned quadratic form of Sk and, in consequence, the inputs of particular
cannot compensate themselves. The condition that σ2 is constant for various iso-modular
HCF does
not exclude, however, a possible diﬀerentiation of the CF sublevels sequence and structure, as well
as the initial state total splitting. In fact, σ and S could be correlated similarly as σk and Sk in the
C (k)
were equal for all k. Nevertheless, the second moment
previous case, only if the elements

and Malta [2] made an attempt to average the σ2 quadratic form by bringing down its respective
1/3
2 in the k-space to a sphere of the same volume
ellipsoid
i
and having a radius equal to the geometric mean of the three ellipsoid axes. In practice, unfortunately,
this elegant approach does not always lead to acceptable results. In the literature the overall eﬀect
of the crystal-ﬁeld interaction is often characterized by a quantitative comparison of the crystal-ﬁeld
strength [17-20]. Additionally, a systematic correlation between the free ion parameters and the CF
strength is observed, namely increase of the crystal-ﬁeld interaction results in the reduction of the
free-ion parameters [17]. The CF strength increases in the RE series with decreasing ionic radius of
the RE3+ host cation [19]. The physical meaning of the CF strength scalar parameter is also supported
by the fact that it rises with pressure applied to a sample [21,22]. The CF strength parameter has
also been used to compare the root mean square error obtained for crystal ﬁelds of diﬀerent strength.
However, its use in such a case is restricted only to comparisons of the identical site symmetries
[10,23]. Furthermore, within the approximation to the second order in the crystal-ﬁeld, the shift in
the center of gravity of a particular 2S+1LJ state due to J-mixing eﬀects is a simple linear function of
the S2
k or S can be extended to deﬁne the quantities Ck and CG [13] as
normalized ”scalar products” of any two compared parametrizations. These quantities represent the
”angles” between the two considered parametrizations and are a convenient measure of the closeness,
i.e. the correlation of any two CFPs sets.

Contrary to the conventional CF strengths Sk and S (Eqs 1,2), which are constant for all the iso-

modular parametrizations, the new strengths S′k and S′ calculated for the constant modulus (and
modules) change their magnitudes within certain ranges discussed in the next section. To compare

0.447, 0.333 and 0.277 for k = 2, 4 and 6, respectively. This compatibility is demonstrated in the next
section, where a thorough discussion of the relation between both the CF strength scales is provided,

On the other hand, the allowed spans of the ∆

(k) for a ﬁx Mk, i.e. σk are known. In the light
(k), and corresponding to them
of the above mapping it turns out that not all of these values ∆
splitting schemes, can actually occur. Namely, depending on the initial state quantum number J and
the multipole’s rank k some speciﬁed limitations of the ∆E(k) are observed (Tables 4, 5 and 6). They
are listed brieﬂy below.

For l = 1 (p-electron) and k = 2 the full nominal range of the ∆

For l = 3 (f -electron) and the value of k = 2 ∆E(2) weakly depends on S′2, varying in all its range

merely from 0.600M2 to 0.608M2, i.e. somewhat below the ∆

Next, for l = 3 and k = 4, the possible ∆E(4) varies within the range from 0.358M4 to 0.482M4,

(Table 6).

The conventional scales Sk or S with the associated second moments of the CF levels, σk or σ, do
not distinguish the iso-modular
HCF parametrizations, which, however, can be diﬀerentiated
by an another scale – the spherically averaged S′k =
|HCF|av. It is proved that
the S′k variation ranges for all the iso-modular parametrizations are limited and lie slightly below
the relevant Sk magnitudes. The span of these ranges amounts to 5, 10 and 20% of their values
for k = 2, 4 and 6, respectively. There exists a direct mapping of S′k ranges into the total splitting
∆E(k) ranges and
|av intervals, which may be interpreted more clearly for the initial states with
low degeneration. Such mapping allows to estimate the total splittings ∆E(k) or ∆E to be expected
(k) or ∆
and characterize their spectrum. It is shown that not all the nominally admitted total ∆
E
splittings determined by the modules Mk or M , i.e. the second moments σk or σ, can actually occur.
This essentially conﬁnes the set of the allowed splitting schemes.

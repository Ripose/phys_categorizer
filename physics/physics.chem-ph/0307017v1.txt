Abstract

We use ab initio molecular dynamics as a basis for quasi-chemical theory evaluation of the free

energy of water near conventional liquid thermodynamic states. The PW91, PBE, and revised

PBE (rPBE) functionals are employed. The oxygen radial density distribution, gOO(r), using the

rPBE functional is in reasonable agreement with current experiments, whereas the PW91 and PBE

functionals predict a more structured gOO(r). The diﬀusion coeﬃcient with the rPBE functional

is in reasonable accord with experiments. Using a maximum entropy procedure, we obtain x0

from the coordination number distribution xn for oxygen atoms having n neighbors. Likewise,

we obtain p0 from pn, the probability of observing cavities of speciﬁed radius containing n water

molecules. The probability x0 is a measure of the local chemical interactions and is central to the

quasi-chemical theory of solutions. The probability p0, central to the theory of liquids, is a measure

of the free energy required to open cavities of deﬁned sizes in the solvent. Using these values and a

reasonable model for electrostatic and dispersion eﬀects, the hydration free energy of water in water

at 314 K is calculated to be −5.1 kcal/mole with the rPBE functional, in encouraging agreement

with the experimental value of −6.1 kcal/mole.

INTRODUCTION

On the basis of its active participation in numerous chemical processes, water should

be regarded as an exceptionally chemical liquid. Water is also the most important liquid

from the standpoint of understanding life processes; the water molecule is in fact the most

important bio-molecule. For such reasons, the molecular theory of aqueous solutions is

a distinct category of the study of solutions. Higher detail is required for a satisfactory

molecular understanding than for non-aqueous solutions, and much of that further molecular

detail is unavoidably chemical in nature. Here we report an initial evaluation of the free

energy of liquid water using quasi-chemical theory [1, 2] and ab initio molecular dynamics

(AIMD). In addition to the physical conclusions that can be based upon the observations

from the physically motivated quasi-chemical theory, the present results should also serve

as benchmarks for the burgeoning eﬀorts applying AIMD to aqueous solutions.

The extant literature oﬀers several papers on AIMD simulation of water (see [3, 4, 5], and

references therein). Some of these simulations, for example [3, 4], used the Car-Parrinello

method, whereas others, for example [5] used a Born-Oppenheimer ab initio molecular dy-

namics procedure. Our own past research eﬀorts [6, 7, 8, 9] has focused on understanding

ion-water systems and chemical reactions in aqueous systems using both the statistical me-

chanical quasi-chemical theory of solutions and a Born-Oppenheimer AIMD approach. These

works invariably diﬀer in methodological detail but have in common severe limitations of

time and length scales that are treated. There is indeed a wide-spread, but undocumented,

view that the AIMD calculations typically describe unsatisfactorily ‘glassy’ water at con-

ventional liquid thermodynamic state points. Thus, independent benchmark eﬀorts should

be zealously encouraged.

In all of the early AIMD works that considered pure water, the questions have largely

centered on understanding the structure and bonding in liquid water (for example, [3, 4,

5]). Quantities often considered are the radial density distribution and the self-diﬀusion

coeﬃcient of liquid water. Though important, these are primitive quantities, and even

so comparisons amongst available results have been inconsistent. Diﬀerent groups appear

to use somewhat diﬀerent analysis procedures, not always documented, and even among

groups using the same procedure there are quantitative diﬀerences in gOO(r)’s, the oxygen-

oxygen radial distribution.

Izvekov and Voth[4] noted this point and helpfully explored

2

the relevant details that went into their calculation of the gOO(r) and oxygen mean-squared

displacement. Quantitative comparisons of properties such as self-diﬀusion coeﬃcients could

be more instructive.

We are unaware of a previous attempt to obtain an entropic thermodynamic property

such as the chemical potential on the basis of information from AIMD simulations on water.

This is ironic because the unusual beauty of water as a molecular ﬂuid is founded on its

peculiar temperature behavior. The phase behavior of water on the surface of the Earth

has been well documented; for example, the equilibrium densities of the liquid and vapor

phases along the saturation curve are known to a far greater percision than, for instance,

the height of the ﬁrst peak in the gOO(r). Chemical potentials (Gibbs free energies per mole

for a one-component system) provide a more basic description of that phase equilibrium.

These free energies are interesting in their own right, as a characterization of the molecular

interactions, and they play a critical role in aqueous phase chemical reactions. The obvious

reason that they haven’t been evaluated from AIMD work before is that they are less trivial

to calculate. An important motivation of the present work is that molecular theory, the

quasi-chemical approach, has progressed to the state that sensible estimates of chemical

potentials can now be obtained from AIMD calculations.

In this paper, we calculate the Gibbs free energy of water on the basis of AIMD simu-

lations. To our knowledge this is the ﬁrst such attempt. To achieve this, we interpret the

results of the AIMD simulation within the framework of the statistical mechanical quasi-

chemical theory of solutions. We ﬁrst sketch this theory and then discuss its applications to

the present case.

II. QUASI-CHEMICAL THEORY

The quasi-chemical theory is founded on describing the solute-solvent interaction by par-

titioning the system into a inner sphere region and an outer sphere region [1, 2]. This

partitioning permits treatment of the chemically important interactions within the inner-

sphere in detail while exploiting a simpler model to describe the interaction of inner sphere

material with the rest of the system. A variational check is available to conﬁrm the appro-

priateness of the partitioning [7], and we will reconsider this point below on the basis of the

present data.

Consider a distinguished water molecule, and deﬁne a inner sphere or bonding region or

observation volume proximal to that chosen water molecule. Here that bonding region is

deﬁned simply as a ball centered on the oxygen atom of the H2O molecule, and diﬀerent

values of the radius of the ball will be considered. The excess chemical potential, the

hydration free energy, of the distinguished molecule can be written as:

µex = RT ln x0 − RT ln

e−∆U/RT χ

DD

EE0

(1)

Here χ is the indicator function for the event that the inner shell region is unoccupied. The

second term of this equation is the outer-sphere contribution to the excess chemical potential.

hh. . .ii0 is the decoupled averaging associated with the potential distribution theorem [2].

Thus the outer sphere contribution would provide the hydration free energy for the case

that the interactions of the distinguished molecule were altered to prohibit any occupancy

of the deﬁned inner shell by any solvent molecule.

The probability that the observation volume centered on a distinguished water molecule

has n occupants is xn. x0 corresponds to the case when this observation volume is empty.

The interactions of the distinguished water molecule with the rest of the solution are fully

involved. In contrast, the outer sphere contribution would provide the excess chemical po-

tential (hydration free energy) for the deﬁned case that the distinguished water molecule

was forbidden inner shell partners. We will estimate that contribution on the basis of a

van der Waals model: a cavity free energy -RT ln p0 plus mean-ﬁeld estimates of contri-

butions from longer ranged interactions. Our strategy here is to estimate x0 and p0 from

the AIMD results and then to model the remaining outer sphere eﬀects, using distinct but

generally available information.

For a given choice of the observation volume, direct observation of x0 from AIMD sim-

ulation would be ambitious. Less ambitious is to infer x0 from AIMD simulation results

for moments that constrain the distribution xn. Robust estimates of the moments hni and
hn2i can be obtained from AIMD simulations. Utilizing a default distribution {ˆxn}, we then

consider a model incorporating Lagrange multipliers λj

− ln

ˆxn (cid:21)

(cid:20)

in which the λj are adjusted to conform to the constraints of the available moments. Such an

information theory procedure has been used before to model hydrophobic hydration [10, 11]

and also the case of Na+ hydration [7].

Determination of the Lagrange multiplers might be accomplished by a Newton-Raphson

procedure (for instance, [12]). Alternatively, the solution can be obtained by minimizing

Operationally we ﬁnd that Eq. 3 leads to a rapid solution. (This point was made before

[12], but note also the obvious typographical error in Eq. 19 there.)

The outer sphere contributions will be partitioned into packing eﬀects, electrostatic, and

dispersion interactions. For a deﬁned observation volume of radius R, the packing contri-

bution was obtained as follows. 10000 points were placed randomly in the simulation box

per conﬁguration, and the population of water molecules in the deﬁned volume calculated.

These give the quantities pn. p0 was then readily obtained by the information theory pro-

cedure. −kT ln p0 directly gives the packing contribution. (This is readily seen from Eq. 1;

see also Eq. 1 in [13].)

The electrostatic eﬀects were modeled with a dielectric continuum approach [14], using a

spherical cavity of radius R. The SPC/E[15] charge set was used for the water molecule in

the center of the cavity. For the dispersion contribution, we assume that the solute-solvent

(outside the observation volume) interaction is of the form C/r6 and that the distribution

of water outside the observation volume is uniform. Thus the dispersion contribution is
−4πρC/(3R3), where for the SPC/E water model, 4πρC/3 is 87.3 kcal/mole ˚A3.

III. SIMULATION METHODOLOGY

The ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations were carried out with the VASP

[16, 17] simulation program using a generalized gradient approximation, PW91, [18, 19] to

5

the electron density functional theory. The core-valence interactions were described using

the projector augmented-wave (PAW) method [20, 21]. The system is 32 water molecules
contained in a cubic box of length 9.8656 ˚A. The 32 molecule system was extracted from

a well-equilibrated classical molecular dynamics simulation of SPC/E [15] water molecules.

This was further energy minimized and then equilibrated (at 300 K) by periodic velocity

scaling using the SPC/E potential for more than 20 ps. The hydrogen atoms were replaced

by deuterium atoms in the ab initio simulation; hence our ab initio simulation corresponds

to classical statistical mechanics of D2O.

The system obtained classically was ﬁrst quenched. After a short (less than a ps) ve-

locity scaling run, we removed the thermostat. At this stage the input temperature was

about 328 K. This system was equilibrated in the NVE ensemble for 10.4 ps. The pro-

duction run comprised a further 4.4 ps of NVE simulation. This run will be referred to

as PW91, corresponding to the functional used. The mean temperature in the production

phase was 334 ±22 K. A 1 fs timestep was used for integrating the equations of motions. For

the electronic structure calculation, convergence was accepted when the energy diﬀerence
between successive self-consistent iterations fell below 10−6 eV. (The default, and usually
recommended, convergence in VASP is 10−4 eV.)

From the terminal state of the PW91 run, two separate runs were initiated. One employed

the PBE [22] functional and a timestep of 0.5 fs. The other simulation employed the revised

PBE functional (rPBE) [23] and a timestep of 1.0 fs. The PBE run lasted about 6.3 ps, of

which the last 3.6 ps comprised the production phase. The rPBE run lasted 7.6 ps of which

the last 3.4 ps comprised the production phase. The mean temperature in the PBE run was

337 ± 21 K, and for the rPBE run it was 314 ± 21 K.

IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

A. Structure and Dynamics

Fig. 1 shows the density distribution obtained in this study. Also shown is the experi-

mental result by Hura and Head-Gordon [24]. Consistent with experiments, the ﬁrst shell

around the distinguished water has four (4) water molecules. This contrasts with classical

water models where typically between 4 to 6 water molecules are found in the ﬁrst shell. In

The current best experimental study using the Advanced Light Source [24] experiment (ALS) is

337 K, and the rPBE run is at a temperature of 314 K. The experiments are at 300 K.

comparison to the experiments, both the PW91 and PBE simulations indicate structuring

of the ﬂuid, whereas the rPBE simulation predicts a less structured ﬂuid. (Note also the

diﬀerences in temperature between the experiments and the simulations). Nuclear quantum

eﬀects will likely soften the computed structures as was suggested by Kuharski and Rossky

[25].

To estimate the eﬀect of timestep, we further propagated the rPBE run for another

4.4 ps with a timestep of 0.5 ps. Initial velocities were assigned to give a temperature of

300 K. The mean temperature in the last 1.5 ps of this run was 298±20 K. The gOO(r)

for this run is indistinguishable from the gOO(r) for rPBE shown in Fig. 1. Although we

expect the gOO(r) to be a bit more structured, the uncertainty in the temperature is large

enough, a consequence of small sample size, that it is not surprising that the structures are

very similar (within the statistical uncertainties). (Note that for a classical model using

two temperatures diﬀering by 20 K and involving a long simulation time does indicate a

softening of the structure at higher temperatures, as expected.)

Comparison with other ab initio simulations of liquid water serves to benchmark those

results. In Table I we collect results on the radial density distribution and diﬀusion coeﬃ-

cient of several earlier studies. The prevailing non-uniform agreement of simulations results

is apparent. A graphical comparison of the density distribution using solely the BLYP func-

tional is provided in Fig. 2, which again emphasizes the non-uniform agreement in earlier

simulations using the same methodology.

The deep ﬁrst minima in the gOO(r) seen in some of our simulations is similar to those seen

in the more modern simulations studies in [28] (Fig. 2) and [5]. Beyond this the comparison

is very non-uniform as illustrated by Fig. 2 and Table I. As noted by Izvekov and Voth

[4] one reason for the discrepancy is likely the diﬀerent analysis procedures used, not all of

which have been documented.

A further point suggested by Fig. 2 and Table I is the need to evaluate the sensitivity of

the results from CPMD simulations to the choice of µ. Indeed, Tangney and Scandolo[29]

have emphasized “the necessity for checking the dependence of results of CP simulations on

the value of the ﬁctitious mass parameter µ.” Those researchers proved that “the ﬁctitous

inertia also causes the slow component of the electronic dynamics to exchange momentum

and energy with the ions, yielding a departure of the CP forces on the ions from the BO

ones for large values of µ”. In other words, a large µ leads to a bias in the force from the

Hellmann-Feynman force. A similar conclusion was also independently reached by Iyengar et

al.

[30]. They showed that for mass values as low as 364 a.u. a systematic bias results.

They obtained stable dynamics for mass values around 182 a.u. in their studies [30].

As indicated in the Introduction, a matter of concern in AIMD simulations is whether

these simulation results are ‘glassy’ compared to water in its liquid phase. Fig. 3 shows the

mean-square displacement of the oxygen atoms. After a transient of about 0.5 ps, purely

diﬀusive behavior is suggested especially clearly for the rPBE simulation. For the PW91

simulation one can still extract a “diﬀusion” coeﬃcient from the linear regime, but its value

9

is less clear. Corresponding to the slight structuring of the PBE simulation over the PW91

simulation, a diﬀusive behavior is less apparent.

dotted line is the straight line ﬁt to the linear diﬀusive regime.

The computed diﬀusion coeﬃcient is 0.2 ˚A2/ps at 314 K for the rPBE run. D2O experi-

10

mental results are available for various temperatures between 274 K to 318 K [31], based on
which we estimate a diﬀusion coeﬃcient of 0.27 ˚A2/ps at 314. Including nuclear quantum

eﬀects is expected to increase the calculated diﬀusion coeﬃcient. Our calculated diﬀusion

coeﬃcient is reasonable, considering the fact that we have only limited statistics. Feller et al.

[32] have suggested much longer simulation times to obtain statistically satisfying diﬀusion

coeﬃcients.

From Figs. 1 and 3, the PW91 simulation has less ﬂuidity than the rPBE run. The PBE

run is even less ﬂuid than the rPBE run. It does appears that the PBE simulation (and

possibly the PW91 run) is leading to glassy-dynamics at around 330 K.

B. Water hydration free energy

Quasi-chemical theory provides a framework to compute the hydration free energy from

AIMD simulations (Section II). The results below are for the rPBE run, unless otherwise

noted. We compute {xn} for various radii of the observation volume. The ﬁrst minima
of gOO(r) is around 3.3 ˚A (Fig. 1) and this suggests an inner sphere radius. In Fig. 4 the

11

{xn} distribution is shown for this particular case. As already mentioned, the wings of the

distribution are diﬃcult to access; in fact only seven distinct occupancies are observed. But

the mean and the second moment seem reliable, the maxent model, Eq. 2, is consistent

with the direct observations, and thus the model is probably more sensible as a proposed

distribution than the direct observations solely. The distribution {pn} for a cavity of size
3.3 ˚A is shown in Fig. 5.

A similar procedure can be carried out for observation volumes of diﬀerent sizes. Of
particular interest to us are the sizes 3.0 to 3.4 ˚A that bracket the minima in the gOO(r)

(Fig. 1). Fig. 6 shows the hydration free energy for cavity sizes in this regime. Here

the electrostatic plus dispersion contribution to the outer-sphere term is obtained using the

simpliﬁed model discussed in Section II. In Fig. 6 the minimum for µex is obtained for R =3.3
˚A. This is consistent with the expectations from the gOO(r) (Fig. 1). It has been argued

before [7] that an optimal inner sphere deﬁnition can be identiﬁed by the insensitivity of the

net free energy to the variations of the inner sphere region. This is based upon the idea that

in the absence of further approximations that net free energy should be independent of the

deﬁnition of inner sphere. When insensitivity is observed despite inevitable approximations

12

it is possible for those approximations to be jointly satisfactory. Fig. 6 conﬁrms this point.

FIG. 6: Cluster-variation of the hydration free energy of water. The open circles give the chemical

contribution, RT ln x0. The open squares give the packing contribution, −RT ln p0. The open

triangles give the sum of outer-sphere electrostatic and dispersion contributions. The net free

energy is shown by solid line.

Using the values for x0 and p0 for a cavity of size 3.3 ˚A, the sum of the chemical

(−9.5 kcal/mole) and packing contributions (8.1 kcal/mole) is −1.4 kcal/mole. From scaled

particle theory [33], at 314 K and under saturation conditions, a value of around 6 kcal/mole

is expected for the packing contribution. Our computed value is a bit higher because the

density is a bit higher than that corresponding to saturation conditions at 314 K. Likewise

our chemical contribution is expected to be a bit lower (more negative) than that expected

at 314 K under saturation conditions. But since these eﬀects go in opposite directions, they

tend to balance out.

For a classical water model, Paliwal and Paulaitis (personal communication) have com-

puted the sum of chemical and packing eﬀects without recourse to the information theory

approach, but relying on about 50 ns of simulation instead. Our IT ﬁts to their data (Astha-

giri et al., unpublished observation) yields −kT ln x0 within 0.5 kcal/mole of their simulated

13

value. For a cavity of size 3.4 ˚A, Paliwal and Paulaitis obtain −0.9 kcal/mole for the chemi-

cal (−7.8 kcal/mole) plus packing (6.9 kcal/mole) eﬀect, whereas we obtain −0.7 kcal/mole

for the same sized cavity. As indicated above, our chemical contributions are somewhat

more negative (Fig. 6) and the packing contributions are somewhat more positive (Fig. 6)

than the values obtained by Paliwal and Paulaitis. The distinguishing aspect here is not in

the agreement for the net sum, especially considering our slightly higher temperature (and

hence a higher density) than their simulations at 298 K. The distinguishing aspect here is:

the inner-sphere chemical eﬀects very nearly balance the outer-sphere packing eﬀects.

For the outer-sphere electrostatic and dispersion contribution, Paliwal and Paulaitis have

explicitly evaluated the second term of Eq. 1 using their classical model. Their computed

sum is about 2.5 kcal/mole more negative than that obtained by our simpliﬁed model.

Thus a more rigorous computation is expected to yield a hydration free energy around

−7.5 kcal/mole. In either case, the computed hydration free energy is within a kcal/mole of

the experimental value.

A similar analysis for the results from the PW91 and PBE functionals gives a hydra-

tion free energy of −12.3 kcal/mole and −14 kcal/mole, respectively. These are in sub-

stantial disagreement with the experimental value. The principal reason is the follow-

ing. The chemical contributions for the PW91 and PBE runs are −16.5 kcal/mole and

−18.2 kcal/mole, respectively. These are substantially more negative than the chemical

contribution of −9.5 kcal/mole obtained with the rPBE functional. This substantially more

negative chemical contribution is clearly reﬂected in the greater structure (Fig. 1) seen for

simulations with these functionals.

Considering the atomization energy of an isolated water molecule provides some insights

into why the revised PBE (rPBE) functional better describes liquid water than PW91 or

PBE. The experimental value of the atomization energy is 232 kcal/mole [22, 23]. The PW91

and PBE functionals predict [22] 235 kcal/mole and 234 kcal/mole, respectively. The rPBE

functional predicts[23] 227 kcal/mole. Thus the rPBE functional is substantially weakening

the intra-molecular bonds in water and this clearly lies at the heart of why this functional

softens the gOO(r) of liquid water and why PBE and PW91 sharpen the structure. The

same physical eﬀect likely also leads to a drop in the temperature for the rPBE functional.

Likewise the BLYP functional yields an atomization energy around 230 kcal/mole. Once

again it is the weakening of intra-molecular bonds that likely leads to this functional softening

14

the structure of liquid water in comparison to the PW91 and PBE functionals. Note a caveat

when comparison between our PW91/PBE results is being made with earlier results with

BLYP. The BLYP results were from CPMD simulations, and as already indicated, published

results from diﬀerent groups [3, 4, 27, 28] do not agree between themselves.

The above comparison of functionals also highlights a conundrum in simulating chemistry

with AIMD. Perdew and coworkers have noted the “procrustean” [34] feature of rPBE that

it weakens the intra-molecular bonds in an isolated water molecule. The same situation

applies to BLYP. Although this helps describe liquid water better, it could come at the price

of describing local chemical eﬀects realistically. This is of immense concern when studying

chemical reactions in liquid water in which water itself is a participant. Such a case arises in

the study of an excess proton or proton-hole [8] in liquid water. Both the PW91 and PBE

functionals under-estimate the proton aﬃnity of HO− by 2 kcal/mole, whereas the BLYP

functional under-estimates this value by about 5 kcal/mole. The rPBE functional is also

expected to substantially under-estimate this proton aﬃnity. Resolution of this conundrum

will have to await a next level of development of electronic density functionals.

V. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper we obtain the hydration free energy of water using ab initio molecular

dynamics simulation in conjuction with the quasi-chemical theory of solutions. Our approach

requires determination of a coordination number distribution {xn}, the fraction of molecules

with n inner shell neighbors. The quantity x0, of fundamental signiﬁcance in the quasi-

chemical theory, is obtained by a maximum entropy approach. The outer sphere packing

contribution was calculated by calculating p0, where p0 is the probability of observing zero

(0) water molecules in a deﬁned volume. The quasi-chemical theory identiﬁed an inner
sphere radius of 3.3 ˚A where the resulting free energy is insensitive to slight adjustments of

that inner sphere region. This is physically consistent with radius of the ﬁrst minimum in

gOO(r). The chemical and packing contributions provide nearly cancelling contributions to

the hydration of water, the net sum being −1.4 kcal/mole. Including outer-sphere dispersion

and electrostatic eﬀects yields a ﬁnal value of −5.1 kcal/mole in reasonable agreement with

the experimental value of −6.1 kcal/mole at 314 K. An important physical conclusion is

that the quasi-chemical approach [1, 2] provides a natural description of the statistical

15

thermodynamics of liquid water. In this analysis, competition between inner shell chemical

contributions and packing contributions associated with the outer shell term are decisive.

Cases in which there is a sustantial skew in either quantity lead to estimates of the hydration

free energy substantially diﬀerent from experiments.

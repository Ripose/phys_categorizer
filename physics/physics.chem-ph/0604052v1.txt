Based on a system-reservoir model, where the reservoir is driven by an external stationary, Gaus-
sian noise with arbitrary decaying correlation function, we study the escape rate from a metastable
state in the energy diﬀusion regime. For the open system we derive the Fokker-Planck equation
in the energy space and subsequently calculate the generalized non-Markovian escape rate from
a metastable well in the energy diﬀusion domain. By considering the dynamics in a model cubic
potential we show that the results obtained from numerical simulation are in good agreement with
the theoretical prediction. It has been also shown numerically that the well known turnover feature
can be restored from our model.

INTRODUCTION

Ever since Kramers proposed his seminal work [1] for
chemical reaction in terms of the theory of Brownian
motion in phase space, the model and its several vari-
ants remain ubiquitous in many areas of natural sciences.
Through the years it has been a subject of several the-
oretical [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] and experimental [9, 10, 11]
investigations for understanding the nature of activated
rate processes. In the majority of these treatments, one is
essentially concerned with a thermally equilibrated bath,
which simulates the reaction coordinate to cross the acti-
vation energy barrier. The inherent noise of the medium
is of internal origin, which implies that the dissipative
force which the system experiences in course of its mo-
tion in the medium and the stochastic force acting on
the system as a result of the random impact from the
constituents of the medium arises from a common mech-
anism. From a microscopic point of view, the system-
reservoir Hamiltonian description [12, 13] suggests that
the coupling of the system and the reservoir coordinates
determines both the noise and the dissipative terms in
the Langevin equation describing the motion of the sys-
tem and therefore these two entities get related through
a ﬂuctuation-dissipation relation [14], which is the char-
acteristics of a thermodynamically closed system in con-
trast to the systems driven by external noise [15, 16].
However, when the reservoir is modulated by an external
noise, it is likely that it induces ﬂuctuations in the polar-
ization of the reservoir. These ﬂuctuations in turn may
drive the system in addition to the usual internal noise
of the reservoir. Since the ﬂuctuations of the reservoir

partment of Physics, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State Uni-
versity, Blacksburg, VA 24061-0435, USA

crucially depends on the response function; one can en-
visage a connection between the dissipation of the system
and the response function of the reservoir due to external
noise, from a microscopic standpoint [17]. At this point
it is important to mention that, a direct driving of the
system coordinate breaks the ﬂuctuation-dissipation re-
lation and can generate biased directed motion that can
be seen in ratchets and molecular motors [18]. On the
other hand bath modulation by an external noise agency
preserves the ﬂuctuation dissipation relation, as a result
of which well known Kramers’ turnover feature can be
restored.

In many cases involving chemical systems the Marko-
vian representation of the Langevin equation is not valid.
In the Markovian description the time scale associated
with the motion of the thermal bath is much shorter than
any relevant molecular time scale. This assumption is
practically never realized in cases where the system co-
ordinate is a molecular vibrational coordinate, because
the correlation time associated with the thermal bath is
usually much longer than a typical molecular vibrational
period. This observation is of no consequence for the
escape rate in the strong and moderate friction cases,
where the particle is considered to be essentially in ther-
mal equilibrium within the well and where the dynamics
takes place only near the barrier top. Non-Markovian ef-
fects may be important also for barrier crossing dynam-
ics, however, this depends on the relation between the
barrier frequency (renormalized by the presence of the
friction) and the friction coeﬃcient. But in the low fric-
tion limit, where the well dynamics is important, energy
accumulation becomes the rate determining step. Fur-
thermore, reactions occurring under the nonequilibrium
situation, the well dynamics becomes crucial and become
dominant in the low friction regime. Obviously the well
dynamics is governed by energy accumulation and relax-

the low friction, there are several treatments that deal
such situation, among which Zwanzig [19], using the as-
sumption that reservoir is always in thermal equilibrium,

2

developed a procedure for reducing the classical Hamil-
ton’s equations of motion for a one dimensional particle
interacting with a non-Markovian heat bath. The escape
of a particle from a potential well has been treated us-
ing a generalized Langevin equation in the low friction
limit by Carmeli and Nitzan (CN)[20]. Thereafter the
detailed classical analysis reveals that the rate is signif-
icantly modiﬁed by memory eﬀects when compared to
corresponding Kramers’ theory.

While nonequilibrium, nonthermal systems have also
been investigated phenomenologically by a number of
workers in several contexts [16, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25], these
treatments concern mainly with direct driving of the sys-
tem by an external noise or a time dependent ﬁeld, e.g.,
for examining the role of color noise in stationary proba-
bilities [21], properties of nonlinear systems [22], nature
of crossover [23], eﬀect of monochromatic noise [24], to
study the chemical reaction dynamics in an anisotropic
solvents [25]. In the present paper we consider a system-
reservoir model where the reservoir is modulated by an
external noise. Our object here is to explore the role of
reservoir response on the system dynamics and to calcu-
late the generalized escape rate from a metastable state
for a nonequilibrium open system in the energy diﬀusion
regime.

A number of diﬀerent situations depicting the modu-
lation of the bath may be of physically relevant. Though
the dynamics of a Brownian particle in a uniform solvent
is well-known, it is less clear when the response of the
solvent be time dependent, as in the case of the dynam-
ical properties of a suspension in a liquid crystal when
projected on to an anisotropic stochastic equations of
motion, or in the diﬀusion and reaction in supercriti-
cal liquids and growth in living polymerization [25, 26].
Also the space dependent friction may be realized from
the presence of a stochastic potential in the Langevin
equation [27]. As another example, we consider a sim-
ple unimolecular conversion from A
B, say an isomer-
ization reaction. The reaction can be carried out in a
photochemically active solvent under the inﬂuence the
external ﬂuctuating light intensity. Since the ﬂuctuation
in the light intensity results in the ﬂuctuations in the po-
larization of the solvent molecules, the eﬀective reaction
ﬁeld around the reactant system gets modiﬁed [28]. In
passing we mention that the escape rate in the energy
diﬀusion regime is just not a theoretical issue today but
has been a subject of experimental investigation over the
last two decades [11].

The outlay of the paper is as follows.

In section II
we discuss a system-reservoir model where the latter is
modulated by an external noise and establish an impor-
tant connection between the dissipation of the system
and the response function of the reservoir due to the ex-
ternal noise. The stochastic motion in energy space and
Fokker-Planck equation has been constructed in section
III. We solve the problem of energy diﬀusion controlled
rate processes in section IV. An explicit example with a
cubic potential is worked out to illustrate the theory in

section V. The paper is concluded in section VI.

II. THE MODEL: HEAT BATH MODULATED
BY EXTERNAL NOISE

We consider a classical particle of mass M bilinearly
coupled to a heat bath consisting of N harmonic oscilla-
tors driven by an external noise. The total Hamiltonian
of such a composite system can be written as [12, 13]

In the above equation, x and p are the co-ordinate and
momentum of the system particle, respectively and V (x)
is the potential energy of the system.
(qi,pi) are the
variables for the i-th oscillator having frequency ωi and
mass mi. gi is the coupling constant for system-bath
interaction. Hint is the interaction term between the
heat bath and the external noise, ǫ(t) with the following
form

Hint =

κiqiǫ(t).

The type of interaction we have considered between the
heat bath and the external noise, Hint
is commonly
known as the dipole interaction [29]. In Eq.(2.2) κi de-
notes the strength of interaction. We consider ǫ(t) to be
a stationary, Gaussian noise processes with zero mean

The form of Eq.(2.4) therefore suggests that the system
is driven by two forcing functions f (t) and π(t). The
initial conditions of the bath oscillators for a ﬁxed choice
of the initial condition of the system degrees of freedom
determines f (t). To deﬁne the statistical properties of
f (t), we assume that the initial distribution is one in
which the bath is equilibrated at t = 0 in the presence of
the system but in the absence of the external noise agency
such that

Now, at t = 0+, the external noise agency is switched
on and the bath is modulated by ǫ(t). The system is
governed by Eq.(2.4), where apart from the internal noise
f (t), another ﬂuctuating force π(t) appears, that depends
on the external noise ǫ(t). Therefore, one can deﬁne an
eﬀective noise ξ(t)[= f (t) + π(t)] whose correlation is

density of the bath frequencies, the coupling of the sys-
tem with the bath, the coupling of the bath with the ex-
ternal noise, and the external noise itself. Equation (2.7)
is the reminiscent of the familiar linear relation between
the polarization and the external ﬁeld, where π and ǫ
play the role of the former and the latter, respectively.
ϕ(t) can then be interpreted as a response function of the
reservoir due to external noise ǫ(t). The very structure
of π(t) suggests that this forcing function, although orig-
inating from an external force, is diﬀerent from a direct
driving force acting on the system. The distinction lies at
the very nature of the bath characteristics (rather than
system characteristics) as reﬂected in the relations (2.7)
and (2.8).

In order to obtain a ﬁnite result in the continuum limit,
the coupling functions gi = g(ω) and κi = κ(ω) are cho-
sen [30] as g(ω) = g0/√τcω and κ(ω) = κ0ω√τc. Conse-
quently γ(t) and ϕ(t) reduce to the following forms:

γ(t) =

dωD(ω) cos ωt

(2.10)

and

ϕ(t) = g0κ0

dωD(ω)ω sin ωt,

(2.11)

where g0 and κ0 are constants and 1/τc is the cutoﬀ fre-
quency of the oscillator (τc may be characterized as the
correlation time of the bath [15] and for τc →
0 we obtain
δ-correlated noise process). D(ω) is the density of modes
of the heat bath which is assumed to be a Lorentzian

cannot be proved unless the structure of ϕ(t) is explicitly
given. However, as we shall see in section V and in the
following discussion that it is a valid assumption (see,
Eqs.(2.15-2.17) and (5.5)) for a particular choice of the
coupling coeﬃcients g(ω) and κ(ω) (see Eqs.(2.10) and
(2.11)) and for a stationary external noise processes (see
Eq.(5.1)). It should be emphasized that the above rela-
tion (2.9) is not a ﬂuctuation-dissipation relation due to
the appearance of the external noise intensity. Rather it
serves as a thermodynamic consistency condition.

Let us now digress a little bit about π(t). The statisti-
cal properties of π(t) are determined by the normal-mode

ϕ(t) = (g0κ0/τc) exp(

t/τc).

Equation (2.14) is an important content of the present
model. This expresses how the dissipative kernel γ(t) de-
pends on the response function ϕ(t) of the medium due
to external noise ǫ(t) [see Eq.(2.7)]. Such a relation for
the open system can be anticipated in view of the fact
that both the dissipation and the response function cru-
cially depend on the properties of the reservoir especially

4

on its density of modes and its coupling to the system
and the external noise source.

This equation shows how the heat bath dresses the exter-
nal noise. Though the external noise is a delta-correlated,
the system encounters it as an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck nose
with the same correlation time as the internal noise
but with an intensity depending on the couplings and
the external noise strength. On the other hand, if the

tency relation (2.9) in the Fourier domain. Without loos-

ing generality we thus will use the general form (3.1-3.2)
to derive the Fokker-Planck equation until we use explicit
form of ǫ(t). Conventionally low-friction regime assumes
1/τc, where γ is the friction aris-
the relation γ
ing due to interaction with the heat bath, evaluated in
the Markovian limit. τc is the correlation time of the
noise due to heat bath and ω is the linearized system
frequency, such relation was also considered by Kramers
in the low-friction regime as well as for the white noise
case. But in this paper we are concerned not only low-
friction regime but also with non-Markovian eﬀect due
to bath. In this context we consider the following time

∆φt(τ ) = φ(t + τ )
calling that τ is the coarse-grained time scale over which
the probability distribution function evolves, whereas τc
is the correlation time, which due to low damping is much
smaller than τ . The low value of γ prompts us to take
1/γ as the largest time scale for the entire problem. How-
ever, the reciprocal of the frequency of oscillation, i.e.,
1/ω, is the smallest time scale. Our task is now to cal-

pendix D of CN [20]), the action variable. For a system
only coupled to a heat bath, i.e., for no external driving,
D(E) reduces to the expression derived by CN [20].

The classical treatment of memory eﬀects in the energy

For an external color noise driven heat bath Λ(ω0) (see

We then numerically solve the Langevin equation (2.4)
using the second order stochastic Heun algorithm [38, 39].
To ensure the stability of our simulation we have used
1. The
a small time step ∆t = 0.001 with ∆t/τR ≪
numerical rate has been deﬁned as the inverse of the mean
ﬁrst passage time [40, 41]. The mean ﬁrst passage time
have been calculated by averaging over 5000 trajectories.
The value of the other parameters used are given in the
caption of Figs.(1) and (2).

In his dynamical theory of chemical reactions Kramers
identiﬁed two distinct regimes of stationary nonequilib-
rium states in terms of dissipation constant (γ). The es-
sential result of Kramers theory is that the rate varies lin-
early in weak dissipation regime (characterized of diﬀu-
sion of energy) and inversely in the intermediate to strong
damping regime (spatial diﬀusion limited regime). That
is, in between the two regimes the rate constant as a func-
tion of dissipation constant exhibits a bell-shaped curve
known as Kramers turnover [4, 5]. In the traditional sys-
tem reservoir model the dissipation and the ﬂuctuation,
both originating from a common source, the reservoir, are
connected through the ﬂuctuation-dissipation relation. A
typical signature of this relation can be seen through the
turnover phenomenon in Kramers’ dynamics. Whereas
for a thermodynamic open system where the heat bath
is modulated by an external noise, both the dissipation
and the response function depend on the properties of
the reservoir, mainly on its density of modes and its
coupling to the system and the external noise source.
By virtue of this connection between the dissipation and
the external noise source, Eq.(2.9) plays the typical role
of the thermodynamic consistency relation, an analogue
of the ﬂuctuation-dissipation relation for thermodynamic
closed system, for which one can expect turnover like fea-
ture in Kramers’ dynamics (for the open system). So, for
the external color noise driven bath we ﬁrst wanted to
check whether Kramers’ turnover feature can be restored
from our model. In Fig. 1 we have plotted the rate con-
stant, k obtained from Langevin simulation, for a wide
range of damping constant, g2
0 for diﬀerent values of ex-
ternal noise correlation time, τe. The ﬁgure shows usual
Kramers’ turnover of the rate constant with variation of
the damping constant. The shift of the maxima occurs as
the external noise correlation time varies, a typical eﬀect
of the bath modulation.

Next we compared the theoretical result (4.17) with the
numerical simulation data. In Fig. 2 we have plotted the
rate constant, k against the damping constant, g2
0 in the
weak damping domain (0.001 6 g2
0 6 0.01) for diﬀerent
values of the external noise correlation time, τe. What
we observe is that the agreement between the theoretical
prediction and numerical simulation is quite satisfactory.

state Kramers’ escape rate from a metastable well in the
low friction regime. The main conclusions of the present
work are the following:

(i) Since the reservoir is driven by the external noise
and the dissipative properties of the system depend on
the reservoir, we have established a simple relation be-
tween the dissipation and the response function of the
medium due to external noise. This relation is impor-
tant for identifying the eﬀective temperature of the heat
bath characterizing the stationary state of the thermo-
dynamically open system.

(ii) We then followed the dynamics of the open sys-
tem in the energy space and derived the corresponding
Fokker-Planck equation with diﬀusion coeﬃcient contain-
ing the eﬀective temperature like quantity which is an
open system analogue of kBT . Following the standard
approach we then derived the generalized non-Markovian
Kramers’ escape rate from a metastable well in the en-
ergy diﬀusion regime.

(iii) From the point of view of the realistic situation
we considered the special case where the internal noise
is white and the external noise is colored and have cal-
culated the escape rate for a model cubic potential. We
have shown that the theoretical prediction agrees reason-
ably well with numerical simulation. In addition to that
we have also shown that our model recovers the turnover
feature of the Kramers’ dynamics when the external noise
modulates the reservoir.

(iv) Finally, as shown in the present work one can eas-
ily tune the external noise parameters from outside which
can be used to study the eﬀect of several kinds of noise
properties, e.g., long tail gaussian noise [7], in Kramers’
dynamics. Another suitable candidate for studying the
escape rate dynamics can be irreversibly driven environ-
ments [42, 43]. In our future communication we would
like to pursue such theoretical analysis.

Abstract

We present a new method, the analytical rebridging scheme, for Monte Carlo

simulation of proline-containing, cyclic peptides. The cis/trans isomerization

is accommodated by allowing for two states of the amide bond. We apply

our method to ﬁve peptides that have been previously characterized by NMR

methods. Our simulations achieve eﬀective equilibration and agree well with

experimental data in all cases. We discuss the importance of eﬀective equi-

libration and the role of bond ﬂexibility and solvent eﬀects on the predicted

equilibrium properties.

I. INTRODUCTION

One modern approach to therapeutics is to identify and block the molecular interactions

responsible for disease. Within this context, combinatorial peptide screening experiments

play an important role in the discovery of inhibitors. Libraries of peptides are used to

discover the crucial molecular structure, or pharmacophore, that can block eﬀectively the

aberrant binding event. Cyclic peptides are preferred for this purpose since they display

higher binding aﬃnities due to their reduced conformational entropy in solution.1,2 The

cyclic scaﬀolds and templates derived from combinatorial cyclic peptide studies have been

used to assemble various spatially-deﬁned functional groups, and highly active analogs have
been synthesized in this way.2–4 A classic example is the blocking of the molecular event

responsible for blood platelet aggregation by peptides of the form CRGDxxxC, CxxxRGDC,

and CxxxKGDC.5 Organic analogs of these RGD peptides have been synthesized, and several

companies are pursuing therapeutic applications in clinical trials.

The ability of a peptide molecule to bind selectively to a receptor depends on its structural

and conformational properties, which are in turn determined by its constituent amino acids.

As the only natural secondary amino acid, proline plays a particular role in peptide and

protein structural biology as a turn-promoting unit.6 Although most amide bonds in native

peptides and proteins are in the trans state, a signiﬁcant fraction (6%) of the X-Proline

amide bonds are in the cis state.6 In some proteins7 and cyclic peptides,8 prolyl cis/trans

isomerization has been detected in solution. This isomerization event is frequently a rate-

limiting step in protein folding. The free energy barrier for the cis/trans isomerization of

typical X-Pro amide bonds is about 19 Kcal/mol.9 While isomerization of non-prolyl amide

bonds is rare, the energy barrier to isomerization is similar.10

Conventional molecular simulations cannot follow the natural cis/trans isomerization

dynamics, since the typical equilibration time is in the range of 10 to 100 s.11 Monte Carlo

simulations have been successful only in the case where isomerization is experimentally

known to occur. In such cases, an isomerization reaction coordinate can be deﬁned, and

2

special techniques such as umbrella sampling can be applied. Conventional molecular dy-

namics for cyclic peptides, even in the absence of cis/trans isomerization, turns out to be

non-ergodic as well, failing to sample the multiple solution conformations during the ac-

cessible simulation time. The diﬃculties arise from the cyclic constraints that, along with

the intrinsic high energy barriers, isolate the accessible conformations to several separated

regions in phase space. Monte Carlo methods, however, do not require the system to follow

the natural trajectory. Therefore, larger and unphysical moves can be performed to over-

come these energy barriers. A numerical peptide rebridging method, inspired by the alkane

rebridging method12 and conﬁgurational bias Monte Carlo (CBMC) method,13,14 has been

successfully applied to the simulation of non-proline-containing, cyclic peptides.15 Parallel

tempering was shown to be a key factor in the eﬃciency of equilibration. Proline poses some

geometrical complexity in the rebridging approach, however, and has not yet been treated.

Here we present a new Monte Carlo method, the analytical rebridging scheme, that is

suitable for equilibration of proline-containing, cyclic peptides. Our analytical method was

inspired by the solution for a related inverse kinematics problem in robotic control.16 The

method can accommodate any rigid unit geometry. The rebridging method is not restricted

to peptides and can be readily applied to other molecules. The cis/trans isomerization is

naturally incorporated in the method by allowing for two states of the amide bond. As an

added beneﬁt, we ﬁnd the analytical approach to be at least ten times more computationally

eﬃcient than the previous numerical method,15 even in the simplest, non-proline-containing

cases. The analytical rebridging method and other components of our simulation method-

ology are described in Section II. We apply our method to ﬁve cyclic peptides that have

previously been characterized by NMR methods in Section III. We show that our method

can eﬀectively equilibrate these molecules, yielding conformations consistent with the NMR

analyses. We discuss the results in Section IV and conclude in Section V.

II. SIMULATION METHODS

3

A. Analytical Peptide Rebridging

Our equilibration scheme involves three types of moves: rebridging moves, SLA moves for

side chains, and swapping moves. The rebridging move is described below and in Sec. II B.

We describe the SLA move in Sec. II C and the swapping move in Sec. II D.

In our system, bond lengths and bond angles are kept at their equilibrium value. We

focus on sampling the biologically-relevant, torsional degrees of freedom. With this simpli-

ﬁcation, a molecule is comprised of a set of rigid units.17 The rebridging scheme can easily

be generalized to accommodate ﬂexible bond angles and bond lengths.

A peptide rebridging move causes a local conformational change within the molecule,

leaving the rest of the molecule ﬁxed. Consider the segment of a peptide backbone shown

in Fig. 1. The angles φ0 and φ7 are rotated, causing the rigid units between 0 and 6 to

change. The range of rotation is within ±∆φmax. These two rotations break the connectivity

of the molecule. We then ﬁnd all the solutions that re-insert the backbone units in a

valid way between rigid units 1 to 6. Our peptide rebridging scheme features an analytical

solution of the geometrical problem arising from the reconnection of the backbone units, a

problem previously solved in a numerical way.15,17 The side chains are rigidly rotated for

each of the solutions. For rebridging moves, the solutions for both the new and the old

conﬁgurations are needed so as to satisfy detailed balance. The analytical solution involves

the reduction of twenty linear equations to an 8×8 determinant equation of one torsional

angle. The determinant equation is equivalent to a polynomial of degree sixteen. Therefore,

the maximum number of new geometrical solutions is strictly limited to 16, a bound that is

obeyed in previous simulations using the numerical rebridging method.18 The determinant

equation is reformulated as an eigenvalue problem16 and solved using the QR algorithm.19

The details of the analytical rebridging method are described in Appendix A.

Following the WJ biasing,15 one of the solutions is picked with a probability proportional

to J(n)exp(−βU(n)), the product of the Jacobian and the Boltzmann factor of the solution.

The Jacobian accounts for the correction to the non-uniform distribution generated by re-

4

bridging moves. An explicit form for the Jacobian is given in Appendix A of ref. 15. The

attempted move is accepted with the probability

acc(o → n) = min

1,

W(n)
W(o) !

,

 

(1)

where W(n) and W(o) are the normalization (Rosenbluth) factors for the new and old solu-

tions, respectively.

B. The cis/trans Isomerization

For each amide bond that we wish to allow to isomerize, we assign two discrete states

to the corresponding rigid unit. As shown in Fig. 2, the amide unit takes the torsional

values of ω = 0◦ or ω = 180◦ in the cis and trans conformations, respectively. The partition

function includes a summation over both states. Because of the sum over states, solutions

corresponding to all the possible cis/trans states between unit 0 and unit 6 are included

in the calculation of the Rosenbluth factor. The same approach can be applied to both

non-prolyl and prolyl amide bonds.

C. Side Groups

The chemical functionality of peptides lies mostly in the side chains. Eﬃcient equili-

bration for the side chains, therefore, is very important. The semi-look-ahead (SLA) move,

based on CBMC methods, has been shown to equilibrate eﬀectively long and bulky chains.15

We use the SLA method as the method for equilibrating side chains and end groups in this

work. A SLA move proceeds by regrowing a randomly selected side chain, unit by unit,

beginning from the bond that connects the backbone to the side chain. The reverse move

is performed so as to satisfy detailed balance. The Jacobian for each solution is unity. The

attempted move is accepted with the probability

acc(o → n) = min

1,

W(n)
W(o) !

,

 

5

(2)

where W(n) and W(o) are the normalization (Rosenbluth) factors for the new and old ge-

ometries, respectively.

D. Parallel Tempering

Parallel tempering was ﬁrst proposed for the study of glassy systems with large free
energy barriers.20 It has since been successfully applied to a variety of systems.21–25 This

method achieves rigorously correct canonical sampling, and it signiﬁcantly reduces the equi-

libration time in a simulation. Instead of simulating a single system, we consider in parallel

tempering a larger ensemble with n systems, each equilibrated at a distinct temperature

Ti, i = 1, . . . , n. The system with the lowest temperature is the one of our interest; the

higher temperature systems are added to aid in the equilibration of the system of interest.

In addition to the normal Monte Carlo moves performed in each system, swapping moves are

proposed that exchange the conﬁgurations between two systems i and j = i + 1, 1 ≤ i < n.

A swapping move is accepted with the probability

acc[(i, j) → (j, i)] = min[1, exp(−∆β∆U)] ,

(3)

where ∆β and ∆U are the diﬀerence of the reciprocal temperatures and energies, respectively.

The higher temperature systems are included solely to help the lowest temperature system to

escape from local energy minima via the swapping moves. To achieve eﬃcient sampling, the

highest temperature should be such that no signiﬁcant free energy barriers are observed. So

that the swapping moves are accepted with a reasonable probability, the energy histograms

of systems adjacent in the temperature ladder should overlap.

III. COMPARISON WITH EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

We perform simulations on ﬁve distinct cyclic peptides that have been previously charac-

terized by NMR methods. We focus on the backbone structure of proline-containing, cyclic

peptides that exhibit cis/trans isomerization. Molecular interactions are described by the

6

AMBER force ﬁeld with explicit atoms.26 Aqueous solvent eﬀects are estimated by simple

dielectric theory.27 Five or six systems were used in the parallel tempering for each simula-

tion, with the highest temperatures ranging from 105 K to 107 K. The lowest temperature

system in each case is 298 K. For the ﬁrst three peptides, cis/trans isomerization is allowed

in prolyl amide bonds only. For the last two peptides, isomerization of all amide bonds is

allowed. The simulations take 5-8 CPU hours for the ﬁrst three peptides and 15-20 CPU

hours for the last two peptides. All the simulations were performed on an Intel Pentium II

450 MHz Linux workstation. Rapid equilibration is achieved for all peptides. The results

are presented below:

1. c(Pro-Phe-D-Trp-Lys-Thr-Phe). This analog of somatostatin displays high activity

in inhibiting the release of a growth hormone.4,28 Analysis of the NMR spectrum in

D2O solution indicated a unique backbone conformation.28 The prolyl amide bond at

Phe-Pro adopted a cis conformation. In our simulation, we ﬁnd an essentially unique

conformation, possessing the same amide bond cis/trans sequence. A representative

conformation for this molecule is shown in Fig. 3.

2. c(Phe-Phe-Aib-Leu-Pro). This pentapeptide contains the Pro-Phe-Phe sequence that

has been proposed to be responsible for the cytoprotective ability of antamanide and

cyclolinopeptides.29,30 NMR analysis indicated that the peptide is conformationally

non-homogeneous at room temperature. Two predominant cis/trans isomers for the

Leu-Pro amide bond were identiﬁed in acetonitrile at 240 K.30 Our simulation led to

two inter-converting conformers in the simulation, as shown in Fig. 4. The cis and

trans conformers occur with probability 58% and 42%, respectively.

3. c(Gly-Glu(OBzl)-Pro-Phe-Leu-Pro) This cyclic hexapeptide was synthesized for use as

a possible chiral site for enantiomeric separation.31 NMR studies in dimethyl sulfoxide

(DMSO) reported two isomers, one having two cis prolyl bonds, and the other having

all-trans bonds. We ﬁnd only the 2-cis conformer in simulation, as shown in Fig. 5.

All the torsional angles ﬂuctuate around mean values, except that the amide group

7

between Pro and Gly ﬂips between two opposite orientations. The all-trans conformer

was found at higher temperatures.

4. c(Pro-Ala-Pro-Ala-Ala). This cyclic peptide has been designed to serve as a rigid

structural template. An unique conformation with two cis prolyl amide bonds in

DMSO solution was found, according to NMR analysis.32 The backbone consists of two

intertwined type-VIb β turns, centered about the two prolyl amide bonds respectively.

We ﬁnd the same unique conformation. The torsional angles are close to the values

derived from restrained molecular dynamics.32 Figure 6 depicts the geometry of this

molecule.

5. Tentoxin, c(MeAla-Leu-MePhe[(Z)△]-Gly). This tetrapeptide selectively induces

chlorosis in the seedlings of plants. Although tentoxin lacks proline, its two methylated

amide bonds were found to adopt the cis conformation in a nearly saturated aqueous

solution.33 The other two non-methylated amide bonds adopt the trans conformation.

The observation of this cis-trans-cis-trans sequence of the backbone, along with other

experimental data, led to a proposed boat-like conformation, with the two cis bonds

located on the same side of the mean plane. In our simulation, we ﬁnd the same amide

bond sequence and boat-like conformation as in the experimental structure. The con-

formation is shown in Fig. 7. All the carbonyl groups lie in the same side of the mean

plane, which implies that we have found the the third major (conformer C, 8%) of

the four conformers found at 268 K in ref. 33. The four conformers diﬀer only in the

orientation of the two non-methylated amide groups. The other three conformers were

found at higher temperatures.

By analyzing the energy trajectories and conformational data, we ﬁnd that all the pep-

tides are eﬀectively equilibrated with relatively few Monte Carlo steps. For example, we

IV. DISCUSSION

8

ﬁnd that the cis/trans equilibrium for molecule 2 was attained within the ﬁrst 10% of the

simulation time. Parallel tempering is crucial for this inter-conversion, since the molecule

essentially does not isomerize in a single, room-temperature, canonical simulation.

For molecule 1, the NMR-based conformational study indicated a type-II’β turn in the

Phe-D-Trp-Lys-Thr region. This turn is characterized by the hydrogen bond between the

C=O of Phe and the N-H of Thr. In our simulation, The C=O of Phe and the N-H of Thr

are close to each other, but are not in precise alignment. Such disorder is expected at ﬁnite

temperature.

Bond angle inﬂexibility may inﬂuence the predicted equilibrium properties of these

highly-strained molecules. We have investigated the dependence on bond angles by changing

the angle between Cα-C and N-Cα in the amide bond on molecule 2 from 6◦ to 0◦. The

predicted cis/trans equilibrium shifts from 42% trans to 14% trans, which is a non-trivial,

although energetically small, eﬀect. We suspect, therefore, that the absence of the all-trans

conformer of molecule 3 in our simulation may be due partly to inﬂexibility of the bond

angles. We used a rigid proline ring, with a φPro = −75◦. This constraint suppresses the

small ﬂuctuations that occur in the proline ring. In exceptional-constrained, cyclic peptides,

φPro can take on other values. For example, φPro ≃ −50◦ has been observed for some unusual

prolines in the trans state.32 Fluctuations in the proline ring may, therefore, be important

in some exceptionally-strained systems.

Although experimental conformational analysis of molecule 3 in water was not performed,

NMR analysis in CHCl3 indicated a minor conformer in addition to the two major ones found

in DMSO solution.31 It is clear, then, that solvent eﬀects play a role in the equilibrium

of molecule 3. Note that the dielectric constants are εCHCl3 = 4.8,34 εDMSO = 45,35 and

εH2O = 78.34 The low-dielectric CHCl3 favored the all-trans conformer. Water, with a high

dielectric constant, may favor the 2-cis conformer, which is what we observe in simulation.

Indeed, upon reducing the dielectric constant in our implicit solvent model, we ﬁnd a small

amount of the all-trans state. However, the detailed structure of the solvent molecules

around the peptide is likely to be important, and a more accurate description of solvent is

9

likely necessary to account fully for the solvent eﬀects.

Tentoxin in water at 268 K was experimentally found to aggregate in a way that sug-

gested micellar organization. The critical micelle concentration (CMC) was estimated to be

roughly 35 µM.33 Conformations observed at concentrations above the CMC may diﬀer from

that of the dilute-limit, monomeric form. In fact, of all four conformers found in ref. 33, only

conformer C yielded chemical shifts for the δ and γ protons of Leucine close to that expected

for a monomeric form. The other two major conformers, A and B, displayed strong shielding

eﬀects. The shielding constants for the minor conformer D were not reported. These shield-

ing eﬀects were explained by an aggregated structure of these two conformers. Since the

concentration of conformer C (250µM) is still well above the critical micelle concentration,

it is not entirely clear why the chemical shifts for conformer C were relatively unaﬀected by

potential aggregation.33 Nonetheless, the experimental data suggests that conformer C may

be either in monomeric form or in an environment similar to aqueous solution. This gives

one possible explanation for the absence of conformers A and B in our simulation, since

these conformers are certainly not in monomeric form.

V. CONCLUSION

We presented a new method, the analytical rebridging scheme, for the simulation of

chemically-diverse, chain-like molecules. The method naturally accommodates cis/trans

isomerizations. Our rebridging scheme, combined with parallel tempering and biased Monte

Carlo, is very successful at equilibration of proline-containing, cyclic peptides. Our method

is not limited to cyclic peptides and can simulate any chain-like molecule. We compared our

simulations with experimental data on ﬁve cyclic peptides and found the predicted confor-

mations to be reasonably accurate. We were able to sample multiple, relevant conformations

separated by high energy barriers, a feat not possible with conventional molecular dynam-

ics. The numerical quality of our predictions, while not limited by sampling issues, may be

limited by our choice of a simple forceﬁeld. Nonetheless, our method can be easily extended

10

to accommodate ﬂexible bond angles and bond lengths. In addition, solvent eﬀects may be

represented more accurately by better implicit solvent models.36,37

The methods described here are powerful enough and general enough to inﬂuence the

preferred approach to simulating biological systems. For example, our method should be a

valuable tool for the ﬁtting of new potential parameters for biological systems. New sim-

ulation methods for long alkanes have made possible the optimization of force ﬁelds that

signiﬁcantly reduce the discrepancies between simulation and experiment.38,39 The same ap-

proach should lead to improved forceﬁelds for biological systems. In addition, we expect that

our peptide rebridging scheme, combined with parallel tempering, should replace high tem-

perature molecular dynamics and is readily suitable for use in NMR-based conformational

analyses of biomolecules.

APPENDIX A: ANALYTICAL METHOD FOR SOLUTION OF THE

REBRIDGING PROBLEM

Our analytical method was inspired by the inverse kinematics problem of six-revolute

manipulators, which is important for automatic control of robotic arms. This problem has

been proved to have at most sixteen solutions in the general case.40 Lee and Liang reduced

the problem to a polynomial of one variable of degree sixteen.41,42 The polynomial is derived

by equating an 8×8 matrix to zero, each element being a quadratic polynomial. A diﬀerent

closed form was obtained later by Raghavan and Roth.43 An excellent review of this subject

is given by Manocha and Canny.16 In the following, we apply the symbolic formulation of

Lee and Liang to reduce our peptide rebridging problem to an eigenvalue problem.

The 6-revolute inverse kinematics can be formulated as an equivalent closed, 7-revolute

mechanism,42 as shown in Fig. 8. The closed loop consists of seven joints with oﬀsets

S1, S2, . . . , S7 and of seven links with lengths of a1, a2, . . . , a7. For a given backbone frag-

ment to be rebridged, the corresponding closed loop is uniquely determined by calculating

the link-joint intersections. We ﬁrst draw the seven joint lines that are parallel to the incom-

ing bonds of the seven rigid units. The links are deﬁned as the shortest line segments that

connect consecutive joint lines. Therefore, each link is perpendicular to the two adjacent

joint lines. We denote the unit axes of the joint Si and the link ai by ˆui and ˆai, respec-

tively. The joint rotation angles φ1, . . . , φ7 are the torsional angles measured around the

joints; they are equal to the corresponding biological torsional angles plus constant oﬀsets.

The joint rotation angle φ7 and other parameters are determined by the given backbone

geometry, and we need to calculate only the six unknown joint rotation angles.

The idea is to ﬁnd an over-constrained set of twenty equations that are linear in x6 ≡

tan φ6/2 and the sines of cosines of φ1, φ2, φ4, and φ5. These equations are obtained by

equating scalar and vector products of the loop axes in both directions of the loop. For

instance, we equate ˆu3 · ˆu6(φ4, φ5) = ˆu6 · ˆu3(φ1, φ2) in the ﬁrst equation (see below). These

equations were ﬁrst derived using a recursive notation.42 We deﬁne the chain vector Rα, β

12

as the vector summation of the consecutive joints and links from unit α to unit β. The

summation always goes in the direction of units 1, 2, . . ., 7. The indices α and β can take

one of two forms: i denotes either starting from or ending at Si, and i’ denotes either starting

from or ending at ai. The index β can be less than α, and this indicates wrapping around

the closed loop. For example,

R6′, 2 = a6ˆa6 + S7ˆu7 + a7ˆa1 + S1ˆu1 + a1ˆa1 + S2ˆu2

Ri′, i = 0 .

(A1)

The twenty equations are listed below. The left-hand side of each equation is a linear

function of cos φ1, sin φ1, cos φ2, sin φ2, and x6. The right-hand side of each equation is a

linear function of cos φ4, sin φ4, cos φ5, sin φ5, and x6:

14

in eq. (A2) and used to express B as functions of φ1, φ2, and x6. This is accomplished by

deﬁning As as the corresponding 16 × 16 sub-matrix of A and multiplying both sides of

these sixteen equations by the inverse of As to obtain

B = As

−1Psx6 + As

−1Qs .

(A5)

Here Ps and Qs are the corresponding sub-matrices of P and Q. We ﬁnd that special

geometries, such as vanishing lengths of links, may render some choices for As singular. The

linear dependence is identiﬁed by singular value decomposition19 and avoided by choosing

16 linearly-independent equations. The expression for B is inserted into the other four

unused equations to yield four equations that are linear functions of x6 and the sines and

cosines of φ1 and φ2. Replacing the sines and cosines of φ1 and φ2 with x1 ≡ tan φ1/2 and

x2 ≡ tan φ2/2, these four equations can be expressed as

(aix2

2 + bix2 + ci)x6 + (dix2

2 + eix2 + fi) = 0,

i = 1, . . . , 4,

(A6)

where ai, bi, . . ., and fi are quadratic in x1. Multiplying eq. (A6) by x2 gives four additional

equations, which together with eq. (A6) can be used to set up a linear set of equations:

0 0 a1 b1 c1 d1 e1 f1
0 0 a2 b2 c2 d2 e2 f2
0 0 a3 b3 c3 d3 e3 f3
0 0 a4 b4 c4 d4 e4 f4
a1 d1 b1 c1 0 e1 f1 0
a2 d2 b2 c2 0 e2 f2 0
a3 d3 b3 c3 0 e3 f3 0
a4 d4 b4 c4 0 e4 f4 0

= 0 .

(A7)

Here 0 is an 8 × 1 null vector. Solutions are found by equating to zero the corresponding

determinant of the 8 × 8 matrix, which can be expanded to a polynomial of degree sixteen in

x1. The determinant equation is best solved by reformulating it as an eigenvalue problem.

This is achieved by rewriting eq. (A7) as

A0 + A1x1 + A2x1
(cid:12)
(cid:12)
(cid:12)

(cid:12)
(cid:12)
(cid:12)

2

= 0 ,

(A8)

where A0, A1, and A2 are 8 × 8 numerical matrices. Note that in the crankshaft case, A0,

A1, and A2 are identically zero, and so any solution for x1 is possible.18 The roots of the

determinant equation are the eigenvalues of the matrix16

15

I
0
−1A1 #
−1A0 −A2

"

,

where 0 and I are 8 × 8 null and identity matrices, respectively. The matrix is ﬁrst reduced

to an upper Hessenberg matrix and then solved by the QR algorithm19 to obtain x1. Occa-

sionally the matrix A2 may be almost singular. This occurs when one of the roots is φ1 ≈ π.

This singularity can be avoided by the transformation

(A9)

(A10)

x1 =

t1x1 + t2
t3x1 + t4

,

where t1, t2, t3, and t4 are random numbers uniformly distributed in [-1,1]. Solutions for

x1 are substituted into eq. (A7) to calculate x2 and x6. These values are substituted back

to eq. (A5) to calculate φ4 and φ5. The angle φ3 is not needed for our purpose; it can be

determined by calculating the positions of a2 and a3 from the other torsional angles.

Structure and dynamics of the interface between a binary hard-sphere crystal of
NaCl type and its coexisting binary ﬂuid

(Dated: January 16, 2014)

Molecular dynamics simulations are performed to study the [100] and [111] orientations of the
crystal-melt interface between an ordered two-component hard sphere with a NaCl structure and its
coexisting binary hard-sphere ﬂuid. The diameter ratio of the two types of hard spheres making up
the mixture is taken to be α = 0.414. This work complements our earlier interface simulations [J.
Chem. Phys. 116, 3410] for the same diameter ratio at lower pressures where the smaller component
is immiscible in the solid and the ﬂuid mixture coexists with a pure FCC crystal of large particles.
Density proﬁles and diﬀusion coeﬃcient proﬁles are presented for the AB interfacial system. We
ﬁnd that for this system, the transition from crystal-like to ﬂuid-like behavior of both the density
and diﬀusion constant proﬁles occurs over a narrower region than that seen in our previous studies
[J. Chem. Phys. 116, 3410] of the FCC/binary ﬂuid system. But similar to what was found in the
FCC/binary ﬂuid interface the transition region for the large particle diﬀusion constant is shifted
about 1.0σA toward the ﬂuid phase relative to that for the small particles.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The kinetics of crystal growth and nucleation from the
melt is highly dependent upon the structure, dynam-
ics and thermodynamics of the crystal-melt interface1.
Given the diﬃculties in obtaining unambiguous infor-
mation from experiments, most of what is currently
known about the microscopic phenomenology of such in-
terfaces is obtained via computer simulation2. Although
most simulation studies have focused on single compo-
nent systems3,4,5,6,7,8,9, there has been recent interest in
multicomponent interfaces10,11,12,13. All of these stud-
ies have involved crystal phases that are either disor-
dered or pure face-centered cubic (FCC) lattices. In this
work we present results for the structure and dynamics
of the interface between an ordered two-component hard-
sphere crystal with a sodium chloride (NaCl) structure
and a binary hard-sphere ﬂuid. Such a system can be
viewed either as as a prototype to understand the inter-
face between inter-metallic compounds and their coex-
isting ﬂuid phases or as a model two-component colloidal
dispersion.

The hard-sphere interaction was chosen for this study
since it is an important reference model for the study of
simple liquids14 and liquid mixtures15. This is especially
true with regard to phenomena associated with the freez-
ing transition. For example, it has been recently shown
that the interfacial free energy of close-packed metals can
be described with quantitative accuracy using a hard-
sphere model16. In addition, recent phase boundary cal-
culations have shown that binary hard spheres form a
wide range of crystal structures depending on the ratio,
α = σB/σA, of the diameter of the small spheres (labeled

B), σB to that of the larger spheres (labeled A), σA.
A substitutionally disordered FCC crystal is the stable
phase for 1.0 > α > 0.85 17 while for α < 0.85, only or-
dered crystal structures are seen to be stable, including
AB, AB2 and AB13 structures18,19,20,21,22. A detailed
study of the disordered FCC crystal/melt interface for
α = 0.9 has been recently reported11.

In this work, we examine two-component hard-sphere
mixtures with a considerably larger size asymmetry of
α = 0.414. This size ratio is signiﬁcant in the theory of
binary alloys in that it is the largest asymmetry in which
the small spheres can be accommodated in the intersti-
tials of a densest close-packed crystal of larger spheres.
The phase diagram for this value of α has been deter-
mined as a function of pressure and mole fraction using
MC and MD simulations by Trizac and coworkers18 and
is reproduced in Fig. 1. At low pressures, the binary
ﬂuid coexists with a pure FCC crystal of large spheres,
whereas at higher pressures (above 50kT /σ3
A) the coex-
isting solid phase is an ordered 1:1 crystal of the sodium
chloride (NaCl) type. Earlier cell theory calculations
also predicted the stability of the NaCl at this diameter
ratio19. Other AB structures such as the CsCl and the
zinc blende have been shown to be unstable at this di-
ameter ratios19,22. Throughout the text we will be using
AB to also refer to the NaCl structure.

A detailed study of the low pressure pure FCC/binary
ﬂuid system has been recently reported12. In that work,
the coexistence between the crystal and an approxi-
mately 1:1 binary mixture was examined, correspond-
ing to a pressure of 20.1kT /σ3
A, which is approximately
twice the coexistence pressure (11.55kT /σ) of the pure
single component system. As the pressure is increased
the mole fraction of large spheres in the ﬂuid phase, X f
A,
decreases, and at a pressure of about 50kT /σ3
A the ﬂuid
coexists with an AB crystal of NaCl type (see Fig. 1). In
this work, we examine in detail the microscopic structure

2

and the total number density, ρ. The total volume occu-
pied by the hard spheres relative to the volume available
to the system is given by the packing fraction,

η =

πσ3
A
6

ρ[xA + (1 − xA)α3],

(2)

where ρ = ρA + ρB = N/V is the total density, xA is
the mole fraction of the larger species, and α = σB/σA
is the diameter ratio.

The procedures for interface construction and equili-
bration of binary interfaces employed in this study are
similar to those used in our earlier work12 on the low-
pressure coexistence in this system (single component
FCC (xA = 1)/binary ﬂuid mixture). Since the gen-
eral interface preparation process is described at length
in that work, only those details speciﬁc to the current
system are described here. The interested reader is en-
couraged to consult reference12 for a more complete de-
scription.

To construct an interface, ﬂuid and crystal blocks are
prepared separately using the calculated coexistence con-
ditions. At a pressure of 53 kT /σ3
A, we independently de-
termined the packing fractions of the coexisting crystal
and ﬂuid to be ηc = 0.683 and ηf = 0.490, respectively
In the preparation of a ﬂuid block, it is a usual prac-
tice to initially position particles in a lattice at a den-
sity lower than coexistence. As the system is allowed to
equilibrate the lattice melts, giving a ﬂuid conﬁguration,
which is then compressed to the coexistence density. For
the system under study here this procedure is not feasi-
ble since the size asymmetry (α = 0.414) and the mole
fraction of small particles (X f
B = 0.903) in the ﬂuid sys-
tem are both large.
(It should be noted that for this
value of α the large sphere volume is over 14 times that
of the small particle.) To construct the ﬂuid phase we
began with an FCC lattice of small particles at a number
density equal to the desired total number density of the
ﬂuid mixture. A number of particles, corresponding to
the target mole fraction of large spheres, are then chosen
at random from this lattice. A molecular dynamics run
is started from this initial conﬁguration and the diame-
ter of randomly chosen particles is periodically increased
until the correct large sphere diameter is attained. The
amount of increase in the diameter at each stage depends
on the maximum increase that is possible without cre-
ating particle overlap. The preparation of the crystal is
straightforward as the small particles easily inserted into
the interstitial sites of the large sphere FCC lattice.

After equilibration of separate crystal and ﬂuid sys-
tems, they are placed in contact within the simulation
box. Due to the periodic boundary conditions, two in-
terfaces are formed. Note that packing fraction used in
the preparation of the initial ﬂuid block is slightly dif-
ferent from the predicted ηf because a gap of 1σA is
placed between the crystal and ﬂuid blocks to avoid any
initial overlap that may occur when the two blocks are

and dynamics of the interface between the high pressure
AB crystal and its melt. To do this, we have chosen
a point in the phase diagram with X f
A = 0.097 . At
this mole fraction, the ﬂuid coexists with the NaCl crys-
tal at a pressure of 53kT /σ3
A. Details of the simulation
methodology and interface equilibration procedure are
outlined in the next section followed by presentation of
the results of the study in Section III and concluding
remarks in section IV.

II. SIMULATION DETAILS

Molecular-dynamics simulations are performed on a
two-component system of hard spheres of diﬀering di-
ameters, σA and σB, with σA < σB (Type A particles
are assumed to be the larger spheres). The interaction
potential between two spheres is deﬁned by the following
pairwise interaction potential

φij (r) =

r ≤ σij
r > σij

,

(1)

where i, j ∈ {A, B}, r is the distance between the cen-
ters of the two interacting spheres, and σij = (σi + σj)/2
is the distance of closest possible approach between two
spheres with diameter σi and σj, respectively. The sys-
tem is completely deﬁned by specifying the diameter ra-
tio α ≡ σB/σA, the mole fraction of large particles, xA

combined. The ﬂuid particles are then allowed to move
while the large particles are ﬁxed so the initial gaps are
then ﬁlled with the ﬂuid particles. The initial ﬂuid pack-
ing fraction is adjusted until an unstressed bulk crystal
is obtained when the two blocks are combined and equi-
librated

In this study, we examine both the [100] and [111]
orientations of this NaCl crystal/binary ﬂuid interface.
For reference, we deﬁne the z-axis to be perpendicular
to the interfacial plane. Periodic boundary conditions
are applied in x, y, and z directions. The length in the
z-direction, Lz, is a sum of lengths of the two separate
blocks in the z-direction and the 2σA-gap initially left
between the two blocks. The total number of particles
used are 22,032 and 22,752 for the [100] and [111] ori-
entations, respectively. The details of the system sizes
used are summarized in Table II. As the systems stud-
ied are large, we have implemented the cell method tech-
nique23 to eﬃciently carry out the molecular-dynamics
simulations23. Equilibration was done for about 4 × 105
collisions per particle(cpp). During sampling, the run
was divided into blocks of 2600 cpp each. The sampling
run was over a length of 30 blocks, but since each block
gives two independent measures of interfacial properties
when the system is properly folded at the center of the
crystal, the results reported are averages taken over 60
samples.

In the course of such simulations the position of the
interfacial plane can shift due to Brownian motion or
due to melting or freezing of the crystal. To prevent
such motion from artiﬁcially broadening the interfacial
proﬁles it is necessary to monitor the position of the in-
terfacial plane during the sampling runs. The standard
measure of interfacial position for a planar interface is
the Gibbs dividing surface1 deﬁned for a multicompo-
nent system as the value of z where the surfaces excess
number of “solvent” particles is zero. However, accurate
calculation of the Gibbs dividing surface requires rela-
tively long simulation runs and is then unsuitable for a
method of monitoring the time dependence of interfacial
position. In our previous studies7,12, we ﬁnd that a more
suitable measure can be obtained from measurement of
orientational order parameter proﬁle as a function of z.
The orientational order parameter is deﬁned as follows

qn(z) =

cos [nθxy(i, j, k)]

,

(3)

+

1
Nz

*

Xi,j,k

3

where n = 4 for the [100] orientation and n = 6 for
the [111], i, j and k are nearest neighbor large particles,
θxy(i, j, k) is the bond angle formed by i, j and k pro-
jected on the x, y plane, and Nz is the total number of
particles that form bond angles. The average is taken
over the number of angles found between z − ∆z/2 and
z + ∆z/2, where ∆z is equal to the layer spacing of the
bulk crystal.

We show in Fig. 2 the order parameters, q4 and q6,
of the two particle types for the [100] (upper panel) and
[111] (lower panel) orientations. As expected q4 (q6) is
small in the [111] ([100]) interface where 6-fold (4-fold)
symmetry dominates. We deﬁne the interfacial position
relative to the midpoint of the orientational order pro-
ﬁle for the large particles. That is, z = 0 in all of the
z−dependent proﬁles presented in this study is deﬁned
as the point at which the orientational order parameter
has decayed halfway from its crystal to ﬂuid value. This
order parameter is suitable as a measure of interfacial po-
sition since it is smoothly monotonically decreasing and
can be calculated accurately for very short runs. The pa-
rameter proﬁles of the small particles are not smoothly
varying because at the interfacial region, some number
of small particles cluster together to occupy large parti-
cle vacancies at the interfacial region (as will be seen in
the density plots presented in the next section) disrupt-
ing the smooth transition from crystal-like to ﬂuid-like
value of the orientational order parameter.

Analysis of the interfacial position as a function of
time shows that during the equilibration run the crystal
exhibits some initial growth, but quickly stabilizes before
the averaging runs are begun. Brownian motion of the

III. SIMULATION RESULTS FOR THE [100]
AND [111] INTERFACES

A. Structure: Density proﬁles and contour plots

The structural variation of the system across the in-
terface is determined by calculating the density proﬁle
for each particle type.

ρi(z) =

<Ni(z)>
LxLy∆z

(4)

where i denotes a particle type, ∆z is 1/25 of the crystal
layer spacing, <Ni(z)> is the average number of particles
of type i in the region between z − ∆z/2 and z + ∆z/2.
The density proﬁles of the two particle types are shown
in Fig. 3(a) and (b) for the [100] and [111] orientations,
respectively. As expected for an NaCl-type lattice, the
small and large particle peaks are in phase in [100] and
exactly out of phase in [111]. This is similar to the reg-
istry of particle density peaks found at the interfacial
region of the lower pressure pure FCC/binary ﬂuid sys-
tem12 . Due to the higher pressures in this study, the
crystal peaks are much sharper than those seen in the
lower pressure binary system12 or in the single compo-
nent interface7. The small side peaks in the NaCl den-
sity are due to the ﬁlling of large particle vacancies in the

lattice structure with several smaller particles - as dis-
cussed below. In order to reveal any change in the lattice
spacing through the interface and to index the interfacial
planes for later use, vertical dotted lines separated by the
bulk crystal lattice spacing were added to Fig. 3. Labels
a to i in the [100] proﬁle marks some layers whose cross-
sectional density distributions have been determined and
will be discussed later. For both orientations, there is no
discernible change in the lattice spacing as the interface
is traversed from crystal to ﬂuid, in contrast to what was
seen in our previous studies where the crystal was either
a pure or disordered FCC lattice7,11,12. In those studies
there was a signiﬁcant increase in the lattice spacing in
the [100] orientation as the ﬂuid side of the interface was
approached.

The oscillations in the ﬁne scale density proﬁles shown
in Fig. 3 make it diﬃcult to see the overall trend in bulk
density, so we have processed these proﬁles using a Finite
Impulse Response ﬁlter7,24 to reveal the non-oscillatory
component of the density variation. The resulting ﬁl-
tered density proﬁles are shown in Fig. 4. The 10-90
width of these bulk density proﬁles provides a measure
of the interfacial width. (The 10-90 width of a mono-
tonically varying interfacial proﬁle is the distance over
which the proﬁle changes from 10% to 90% of the higher
of two coexisting bulk values, relative to the lower bulk
value.) The 10-90 width derived from the large particle
density proﬁle of the [100] orientation [see Fig. 4(a)] is
2.6σA, corresponding to the region between z = −2.2σA
to z = 0.4σA. For the small particles the 10-90 width
is smaller at 2.3σA and the 10-90 region (z = −1.7σA
to z = 0.6σA) is shifted slightly toward the ﬂuid, rela-
tive to the 10-90 region of the large spheres. Combining
these two regions, the interfacial region of the [100] ori-

i is in the bulk ﬂuid and b to h are interfacial regions.
The decrease in density peak height of the large (Type
A) spheres in Fig. 3 starting at layer b is initially due
to the presence of lattice vacancies as shown in Fig. 5.
Small particle vacancies also start to appear in layer b of
Fig. 6. We also ﬁnd by comparing Figs. 3 and 5 for layers
c and d that the side peaks appearing at these layers are
due to the accumulation of small particles in the large
sphere vacancies. The structure of this vacancy ﬁlling is
interesting in that the large particle is typically replaced

entation deﬁned by the densities has a width of 2.8σA.
The total interfacial width deﬁned for the densities for
the [111] orientation (2.9σA) is not signiﬁcantly diﬀer-
ent than that for [100]. The interfacial widths of the
large particle density proﬁles are identical to those found
in our earlier lower pressure FCC/binary ﬂuid interface
study12 for the same diameter ratio, but narrower than
the 3.3σ widths found in the single component system7.
In contrast, the small particle interfacial widths found
here are much smaller than those found in the lower pres-
sure study, where they were found to be about 3.3σA. As
a consequence, the overall interface for the NaCl/ﬂuid is
slightly narrower than the lower pressure pure FCC/ﬂuid
interface.

To get a detailed understanding of the structural
transition across the interface between the two coexist-
ing phases, we have determined the cross-sectional den-
sity distributions within layers parallel to the interfacial
plane. For each layer, the 2-D density distribution is
deﬁned as

ρz
i (x, y) =

<N z
i (x, y)>
∆x∆y∆z

(5)

where i denotes a particle type, ∆x = ∆y = 0.12σA, ∆z
is the crystal layer spacing, which is 0.74σA for [100].
The average number of particles of type i in the volume
given by ∆x∆y∆z is < N z
i (x, y) >. In Figs. 5 and 6 are
density contour plots of the [100] interface for the large
and small particles, respectively. Layers a to i are as la-
beled in Fig. 3(a), where a is deep into the bulk crystal,

by 6 small particles (although a small number of vacan-
cies ﬁlled with 5 or 7 small spheres do occur) with little
disturbance to the surrounding lattice. This can be seen
in Fig. 7 where a snapshot of one of these ﬁlled vacancies
in layer c is shown. A uniform 2-D density distribution
begins to develop in layer G for both particle types indi-
cating that, although the z−dependent density proﬁles
still has some oscillations in this region, the structure is
that of an inhomogeneous ﬂuid at a wall.

z + ρsolvent

Of particular interest to materials scientists is the de-
gree of interfacial segregation - the preferential adsorp-
tion (or desorption) of one component (usually the “so-
lute”) at the interface. This quantity is deﬁned relative
to the Gibbs dividing surface. The Gibbs dividing sur-
face of a planar interface is deﬁned1 as the plane along
the z−axis giving a vanishing surface excess solvent par-
ticle number, Γsolvent, deﬁned in the equation
N solvent/A = ρsolvent

(Lz − z) + Γsolvent
(6)
where N solvent the total number of solvent particles
spheres, A is the area of the interface, ρsolvent
and
ρsolvent
are the bulk densities, z is the location of the
L
interface assuming the length of the simulation box runs
from 0 to Lz. Deﬁning the small particles as the ’sol-
vent’, we ﬁnd that the Gibbs dividing surfaces are at
z = −0.49σA and z = −0.93σA relative to the position
calculated from the large particle order parameter for
the [100] and [111] orientations, respectively. Surface
excess of the ’solute’ particles, ΓA was found to be neg-
ligible, indicating the absence of interfacial segregation,
a result that is consistent for other crystal/melt systems
that have been investigated7,9,12.

B. Transport: Diﬀusion coeﬃcient proﬁles

Inhomogeneities in the transport properties within
the interfacial region can be examined by calculating

twice the layer spacing in [111].

bulk ﬂuid value for the large particles in the lower pres-
sure FCC/binary ﬂuid system is 0.012(kT σ2
A/m)1/2 and
A/m)1/2. Since
that for the small particles is 0.050(kT σ2
the AB/ﬂuid system has a higher pressure and larger
ﬂuid packing fraction, the bulk ﬂuid diﬀusion coeﬃcient
values are lower: 0.008(kT σ2
A/m)1/2 for the large parti-
cles and 0.029(kT σ2
A/m)1/2 for the small particles. The
diﬀerence in magnitude between the small and large par-
ticle diﬀusion constants makes it diﬃcult to compare
the two diﬀusion proﬁles. For a clearer comparison in
Fig. 8(b) we plot the data in Fig.8(a) normalized rela-
tive to the bulk ﬂuid values. Traversing the system from
ﬂuid to crystal, we ﬁnd a region of width greater than
1σA where the small particles have nonzero diﬀusion co-
eﬃcient while the large particles have have eﬀectively
zero diﬀusion. Both high- and low-pressure systems ex-
hibit this shift in the change from crystal-like to ﬂuid-like
motion of the two particle types.

As was done for structural transition, we can also de-
ﬁne the extent of dynamical transition by determining
the 10-90 region from diﬀusion coeﬃcient proﬁles. From
the diﬀusion coeﬃcient proﬁle of the large particles this
region starts from z = −0.7σA up to z = 1.3σA, result-
ing to a width equal to 2.0σA and centered at z = 0.3σA.
The small particles deﬁne an interfacial region that starts
from z = −2.2σA and ends at z = 0.6σA. These bound-
aries give a width of 2.8σA, which is 40% greater than
the width from diﬀusion of the large particles. Also, the
midpoint is shifted by 1.1σA to the ﬂuid side relative to
the midpoint of the region deﬁned by the large particles.

interfaces7,12 the regions deﬁned each of the indi-
vidual density and diﬀusion coeﬃcient proﬁles do not
all coincide, so we take a union of these 10-90 regions
to deﬁne the full interfacial region. Taking into account
all proﬁles, the NaCl/binary ﬂuid hard-sphere interface
studied here has an overall 10-90 width of 3.5σA,
corresponding to layers c to g in Fig. 3. As perhaps
expected for the higher pressure system, this interfacial
region is narrower than the one found for lower pressure
FCC/binary ﬂuid interface12, which was found to be
4.8σA. To summarize all of the proﬁle data for quick
inspection we show in Fig. 9 all order parameters
proﬁles, normalized such that we have all values equal
to unity in the bulk crystal and zero in the bulk ﬂuid for
the [100] interface. Except for diﬀerences in the overall
interfacial width, this plot is qualitatively quite similar
to the corresponding plot for our earlier low-pressure
FCC/binary ﬂuid simulations in that the transition of
densities for both particle types and the diﬀusion of
the small particles is observed over approximately the
same region, while the transition for the large particle
diﬀusion is shifted by about 1σA (1.3σA in the earlier
study). Another notable feature in this plot is that the

IV. SUMMARY

Using molecular-dynamics simulation, we have inves-
tigated the structure and dynamics of the [100] and [111]
crystal-melt interfaces of the AB(NaCl)/binary ﬂuid sys-
tem for a two-component hard-sphere system in which
the ratio of small to large particle diameter is α = 0.414.
This system was at a pressure of 53kT /σ3
A that is at the
lower range of the NaCl crystal/ﬂuid coexistence region.
These simulations complement our earlier work12 on the
pure FCC/binary ﬂuid interface found in this same sys-
tem at lower pressure (20.1kT /σ3
A). We ﬁnd that the
higher pressure AB/binary-ﬂuid interface has a narrower
interfacial region of 3.5σA compared to the lower pres-
sure FCC/binary ﬂuid system at the same diameter ra-
tio, which had an interfacial region of width 4.8σA. In
addition, the crystal side of the higher pressure binary in-
terface exhibited much higher vacancy defect concentra-
tions than either the low pressure binary system or the
single-component interface7. In the interfacial region, all
vacancies in the large particle lattice were found, with lit-
tle distortion in the surrounding lattice, to be ﬁlled with
an average of 6 small particles. Similar to what was
seen in the lower pressure FCC/binary ﬂuid interface,
the transition regions for both density proﬁles and the
small particle diﬀusion constant are approximately coin-
cident whereas the diﬀusion proﬁle for the large particles
is shifted relative to the others by about 1σA toward the
liquid side of the interface.

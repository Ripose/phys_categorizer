Abstract

A theoretical model of hyperﬁne spectra of nuclear spin conversion of molec-
ular isomers has been developed. The model takes into account the nu-
clear spin-spin and spin-rotation interactions, as well as the saturation of in-
tramolecular mixing of molecular ortho and para states. The model has been
applied to hyperﬁne spectra of nuclear spin conversion in 13CH3F molecules
subjected to an external electric ﬁeld. Conditions under which the hyperﬁne
structure in the spectra can be resolved have been determined.

I. INTRODUCTION

Recently, much attention has been devoted to the investigation of the level-crossing
resonances in the spin isomer conversion (conversion spectra) in CH3F [1–7]. The goal was
to test the mechanism of the ortho-para conversion in this molecule. The importance of
these eﬀorts is clear. CH3F is the ﬁrst and until now the only polyatomic molecule in which
a spin conversion mechanism was identiﬁed. On the other hand, one may expect a similar
conversion mechanism in other symmetrical molecules too.

The essence of the isomer conversion spectra consists of the following. An external
homogeneous electric ﬁeld splits the molecular states. At some electric ﬁeld the ortho and
para states of the molecule cross which, speeds up the rate of conversion. Scanning of the
electric ﬁeld gives the ﬁeld dependence of conversion rate which is the conversion spectrum.
Measurements of the conversion spectra are presently performed at room temperature.

The usefulness of the conversion spectra should not be limited to the investigation of the
conversion itself. In fact, this is a new physical eﬀect which can ﬁnd various applications. For
example, it was proposed [3] to measure with the help of the conversion spectra characteris-
tics of molecular spin-rotation interaction which are hardly accessible by ordinary methods.
Many of these applications require a deeper understanding of the phenomenon. Up to now,
only the rotational structure in the conversion spectra resulting from M-splitting of molec-
ular states has been considered. This is suﬃcient for the conversion spectra of ∼1 MHz
resolution. Higher resolution needs an account of the hyperﬁne structures in the conversion
spectra, which has not been done before. In this paper we perform such an analysis and
determine the conditions at which these hyperﬁne structures can be observed. We check
also an accuracy of the simpliﬁed approach to the conversion spectra in which hyperﬁne
splitting of molecular states is neglected. The calculations are done for 13CH3F because for
this molecule the rotational structure in the conversion spectra was experimentally observed
recently [5]. The spectral resolution achieved already in [5] was better than 6 MHz. It makes
the 13CH3F molecule the best candidate for the observation of the hyperﬁne structures in
the conversion spectra.

II. QUANTUM RELAXATION OF SPIN ISOMERS

Ordinary gaseous relaxation processes are insensitive to a tiny hyperﬁne splitting of
molecular states. This is a consequence of the fact that the kinetic energy of colliding
particles is much larger than the hyperﬁne level splitting. For the nuclear spin conversion in
molecules the situation can be diﬀerent if the conversion is induced by intramolecular state
mixing and collisional interruption of this mixing (we will refer to this process as quantum
relaxation [8]) which is rather sensitive to the ortho-para level splitting.

The CH3F molecules exist in the form of two nuclear spin isomers [9]. The total spin
of the three hydrogen nuclei in the molecule can have the magnitude either I = 3/2 (ortho
isomers), or I = 1/2 (para isomers). Angular momentum projections (K) on the molecular
symmetry axis divisible by 3 are allowed only for ortho isomers. For para isomers all other K
values are allowed. Consequently, the quantum states of the CH3F molecule are divided into

2

two subspaces which are schematically shown in Fig. 1. Qualitatively, CH3F spin conversion
by quantum relaxation can be described as follows. Suppose that at the beginning of the
process a test molecule is placed into the ortho subspace. Due to collisions with surrounding
gas particles, which cannot change the spin state of the molecule, the test molecule starts
to perform fast migration along rotational states inside the ortho subspace. This running
up and down along the ladder of the ortho states continues until the molecule jumps into
the state m which is mixed by an intramolecular perturbation ˆV with the energetically close
para state n. During the free ﬂight after this collision, para state n will be admixed with the
ortho state m. Consequently, the next collision can transfer the molecule into other para
states and thus localize it inside the para subspace. More details on quantum relaxation of
nuclear spin isomers can be found in Refs. [10–12].

Quantum relaxation of nuclear spin isomers of molecules can be quantitatively described
in the framework of the density matrix formalism. The result of this description is the
following [12]. One has to divide the molecular Hamiltonian into two parts

ˆH = ˆH0 + ˆV ,

(1)

where the main part of the Hamiltonian, ˆH0, has pure ortho and para states as the eigen-
states, and ˆV is a small perturbation which mixes the ortho and para states. In the Ref. [12]
the hyperﬁne contribution to the term ˆH0 was neglected and it was assumed that the
molecule is not subjected to an external ﬁeld.

Suppose that at the instant t = 0 a nonequilibrium concentration of, e.g., ortho molecules,
δρo(0), was created. the solution of the problem gives an exponential isomer conversion:
δρo(t) = δρo(0)e−γt, with the rate

γ = Xα∈o,α′ ∈p

2Γ | Vαα′ |2
Γ2 + ω2

αα′

(Wα + Wα′) .

Here Γ is the collisional decay rate of the oﬀ-diagonal density matrix elements,

(∂ραα′/∂t)coll = −Γραα′; α ∈ ortho, α′ ∈ para,

(2)

(3)

assumed to be the same for all ortho-para level pairs; ωαα′ is the gap between the states
|α > and |α′ >; Wα and Wα′ are the Boltzmann factors. Solution (2) was obtained under
the assumption that collisions do not transfer molecules directly from ortho to para states,
i.e., the cross-section σ(ortho|para) = 0. The validity of this assumption has been discussed
in detail in the review [13].
At low gas pressure, when Γ ≪ ω, the conversion rate is proportional to Γ, thus being
proportional to the gas pressure.
In this limiting case, the pressure dependence of the
conversion rate is quite similar to ordinary gaseous relaxation which is linear in pressure
too. On the other hand, in this pressure limit the conversion rate is sensitive to the ortho-
para level splitting (note ω in the denominator of (2)) thus having a distinctive signature,
unusual for gaseous relaxation processes. This strong dependence on ω is at the heart of the
level-crossing eﬀect at the spin isomer conversion.

III. STARK LEVEL SPLITTING

Calculation of the ortho-para state mixing is rather complicated, especially if one has
to account for both the Stark and hyperﬁne level splitting. In this case special care should
be taken about proper symmetrization of states and their transformation under these per-
turbations. Let us consider ﬁrst the quantum states of the free molecule and ignore the
hyperﬁne perturbation. Spin-rotational states in the ground electronic and vibrational state
of CH3F can be constructed as follows [14,15]. To determine the molecular position in space,
one introduces a system of coordinates (xyz) ﬁxed in the molecule (Fig. 2). By combining
rotational and nuclear spin states, one introduces the states |β > which are invariant under
cyclic permutation of the three hydrogen nuclei

|β > ≡ |J, K, M > |I, σ, K >;

|β > ≡ |J,−K, M > |I, σ,−K >; K ≥ 0,

(4)

where |J, K, M > are the quantum states of symmetric top characterized by the angular
momentum (J), its projection (K) on the z axis of the molecular system of coordinates and
the angular momentum projection (M) on the quantization Z axis of the laboratory system
of coordinates. I and σ are the total spin of the three hydrogen nuclei and its projection
on the Z axis, respectively. The explicit expressions for the spin states |I, σ, K > are given
in [14]. These expressions specify the allowed K-quantum numbers for the ortho and para
spin isomers as was explained in Section II.

Permutation of any two hydrogen nuclei in CH3F inverts the z axis of the molecular
system of coordinates. Such permutations, e.g., the permutation P23, acts on the state |β >
as P23|β >= (−1)J|β >. Because the states |β > are invariant under cyclic permutation of
the three hydrogen nuclei, a similar result is valid for the other two permutations of hydrogen
pairs: P12 and P31.

States |β > and |β > generate a two-dimensional representation of the molecular sym-

metry group. Spin-rotation states, which generate one-dimensional representations are

|β, κ > ≡

1
√2

[(−1)κ + P23]|β >;

κ = 0, 1.

(5)

From this deﬁnition it is easy to conclude that the symmetry of states |β, κ > is determined
by the rule: P23|β, κ >= (−1)κ|β, κ > and by similar relations for the permutations of the
other two pairs of protons.
Further, one has to take into account the molecular inversion states. Let us designate
the antisymmetric and symmetric inversion states of the molecule as |s = 0 > and |s = 1 >,
respectively. Permutation of two protons, e.g., P23, acts on the inversion states as [15]

P23|s = 0 > = −|s = 0 >; P23|s = 1 > = |s = 1 > .

(6)

The total quantum states of CH3F have to be antisymmetric under the permutation
of any two hydrogen nuclei because protons are fermions. Consequently, the only allowed
molecular states are |β, κ = s > |s >.

4

The last step is to account for the spin states of the ﬂuorine and carbon (13C) nuclei,

both having spin 1/2. Finally, the molecular states are

|αs > ≡ |β, κ = s > |s > |σF > |σC >,

(7)

where σF and σC denote, respectively, the projections of the ﬂuorine and carbon nuclear spins
on the laboratory quantization Z axis. The states (7) of the free molecule will be denoted
as the α-basis. For rigid symmetric tops, like CH3F is, the states |αs > are degenerate in
the quantum numbers M, σ, σF , σC and s.
An external electric ﬁeld due to the Stark perturbation, ˆVSt = −ˆdE, mixes the states
having |∆s| = 1 and |∆J| ≤ 1. In the following, we will consider relatively weak electric
ﬁelds which produce Stark splitting much smaller than the J-splitting. Consequently, the
Stark mixing of states having |∆J| = 1 can be neglected and one has to solve the Schr¨odinger
equation for the doubly degenerate states |α0 >; |α1 >. In a standard way [9], one can ﬁnd
the energy of the new states,

E(β, ξ) = Ef ree(J, K) + (−1)ξ K|M|

J(J + 1)

dE; ξ = 0, 1,

(8)

where Ef ree(J, K) is the energy of a free molecule; d is the so-called permanent electric
dipole moment of the molecule; E is the electric ﬁeld strength; ξ is the quantum number of
the new molecular states which are

|β, ξ >=

1

2 "(−1)ξ M

|M||s = 0 > (1 + P23) + |s = 1 > (1 − P23)#|β > .

(9)

The magnitude of the electric dipole moment, d, is determined by the molecular spatial and
electronic structure [14]

Similar to the case of a free molecule, one has to take into account the spin states of
ﬂuorine |σF > and carbon |σC > nuclei which remain intact by Stark perturbation. Finally,
the states of the CH3F molecule subjected to an external electric ﬁeld are

|µ > ≡ |β, ξ > |σF > |σC > .

(10)

The manifold of these states will be denoted as the µ-basis. The Stark eﬀect partially lifts
the degeneracy of the α-states. But the µ-states remain degenerate in sign of M, and in
quantum numbers σ, σF and σC.

IV. HYPERFINE LEVEL SPLITTING

In accordance with the general rules, the molecular Hamiltonian, ˆH, which contains now

the hyperﬁne and Stark perturbations, can be expressed in the µ-representation as

ˆH = Xµ1 Xµ2 |µ2 >< µ2| ˆH|µ1 >< µ1| ≡ ˆH(o) + ˆH(p) + ˆV ,

(11)

5

where the sums run over the complete set of states. We recall that the operatorP |µ >< µ| is

the identity operator if the summation includes all states of the complete set. Eq.(11) shows
how the molecular Hamiltonian can be split into three operators: ˆH(o) and ˆH(p) which have
only diagonal matrix elements in the ortho and para subspaces, respectively, and operator
ˆV , which has only matrix elements oﬀ-diagonal in the ortho and para quantum numbers.

When considering the combined level splitting by the three perturbations: Stark eﬀect,
hyperﬁne spin-rotation and spin-spin perturbations it is helpful to start with the Stark eﬀect.
Taking into account the Stark eﬀect is not diﬃcult because Stark perturbation does not mix
the ortho and para states of a free molecule. In fact, transformation from the α-basis of a
free molecule to the µ-basis gives the level splitting by the Stark eﬀect.

A. Spin-rotation interaction

The next perturbation to be considered is the spin-rotation coupling which is due to
the interaction of nuclear spins with the intramolecular magnetic ﬁeld induced by molecular
rotation. The spin-rotation interaction Hamiltonian is given by the operator [14,16]

¯h ˆHSR = −Xk

ˆI(k) • C(k) • ˆJ ≡ ¯hXk

ˆH (k)
SR ,

(12)

where ˆI(k) and C(k) are, respectively, the spin operator and the spin-rotation tensor for the
k-th nucleus; ˆJ is the molecular angular momentum operator and k denotes all nuclei in the
molecule. The magnitude of the spin-rotation tensor C depends on the molecular spatial
structure and motion of the molecular electrons [14].

Spin-rotation interaction is of the order 10 − 100 kHz which is much smaller than the
energy gaps between the states having diﬀerent J and K (> 102 GHz), and is much smaller
than the Stark splitting of states diﬀerent in |M| and ξ (> 10 MHz). Consequently, only
matrix elements of ˆHSR diagonal in quantum numbers J, K, M, ξ and I are important
for the calculation of the spin-rotation splitting of states [17]. Because the operator ˆHSR is
a scalar, the only non-zero matrix elements will be the elements diagonal also in the spin
projections σ, σF and σC. Explicit expressions for these matrix elements can be found in
[16]. For example, the diagonal matrix elements for the spin-rotation interaction of the
ﬂuorine nucleus are

MσF "cF

α +

K 2

J(J + 1)

(cF
β − cF

α )# ,

(13)

α and cF

where constants cF
β are the diagonal elements of the tensor CF , calculated in the
molecular system of coordinates. The spin-rotation tensor of ﬂuorine and hydrogen nuclei
are given in [16]. The tensor CC for the carbon nucleus is absent in [16]. We will use for its
estimation the relation: CC=CF mC/mF , where mC and mF are the magnetic moments of
13C and F nuclei, respectively.

One can conclude, that the spin-rotation splitting of states appears to be rather simple
in the µ-basis because this perturbation only shifts the states but does not mix them. As
an example, the spin-rotation splitting of the state (J=9, K=3, M=9) is shown in Fig. 3b.

B. Spin-spin interaction

Nuclear spin-spin interaction in molecules is composed of dipole-dipole interaction of
pairs of nuclei. The spin-spin interaction Hamiltonian for the two magnetic dipoles m1 and
m2 separated by the distance r has the form [9]

¯h ˆH12 = P12ˆI(1)ˆI(2) •
T (12)
ij = δij − 3ninj ;

• T(12) ;

P12 = m1m2/r3I (1)I (2) ,

(14)

where ˆI(1) and ˆI(2) are the spin operators of the particles 1 and 2, respectively; n is the unit
vector directed along r; i and j are the Cartesian indices.

The total spin-spin interaction in 13CH3F ( ˆHSS) consists of the interactions between the
three hydrogen nuclei ( ˆHHH), hydrogen - ﬂuorine nuclei ( ˆHHF ), hydrogen - carbon nuclei
( ˆHHC), and ﬂuorine - carbon nuclei ( ˆHF C). Consequently, the total spin-spin Hamiltonian
in 13CH3F is

ˆHSS = ˆHHH + ˆHHF + ˆHHC + ˆHF C.

(15)

Explicit expressions for all these terms can be written on the basis of Eq.(14) for one pair of
nuclei. For example, for the spin-spin interaction between the three hydrogen and ﬂuorine
nuclei one has

¯h ˆHHF = PHF Xn

ˆI(n)ˆIF •

• TnF ; n = 1, 2, 3 .

(16)

Here the sum runs over all hydrogen nuclei in the molecule. Complete deﬁnition of the
spin-spin interaction requires knowledge of the dimensional factors P (see Eq.(14)) and the
spatial structure of the molecule. These data can be found in Refs. [12,18].

Without hyperﬁne interactions, quantum states of the molecule subjected to an external
electric ﬁeld form the µ-basis. The intramolecular spin-spin perturbation ˆHSS has non-zero
matrix elements diagonal and oﬀ-diagonal in quantum numbers J, K, M, σ, σF , and σC.
The J, K-splitting of states is much larger than the spin-spin splitting which is on the order
of 10 − 100 kHz. Therefore, one can neglect the matrix elements of ˆHSS oﬀ-diagonal in J
and K.
Under our conditions the Stark splitting of states diﬀerent in |M| is much larger than the
spin-spin interaction. Thus, only the matrix elements of ˆHSS diagonal in M are important if
|M| > 1 because of the selection rule |∆M| ≤ 2 for the spin-spin interaction. Oﬀ-diagonal in
M matrix elements of ˆHSS are important only for the states having |M| = 1. This particular
case will be considered elsewhere. One can conclude, that the spin-spin perturbation of µ-
states is determined by the matrix elements of ˆHSS diagonal in quantum numbers J, K, M,
ξ, I and in the values of the sum σ + σF + σC.

To summarize, the hyperﬁne structure of molecular states in our case is determined by
the hyperﬁne Hamiltonian ˆHSR + ˆHSS spanned by the states diﬀerent only in the projections
of nuclear spins σ, σF , and σC. There are 4 × 2 × 2 = 16 such states for ortho molecules:

7

| βortho, ξ >| σF >| σC >,

and 2 × 2 × 2 = 8 states for para molecules:

| βparaξ >| σF >| σC > .

(17)

(18)

Matrix elements of ˆHSR are give by Eq. (13). Calculation of the matrix elements of all
terms of ˆHSS can be done in a way similar to that explained in the Appendix. After all
necessary matrix elements of ˆHSR and ˆHSS are determined one can ﬁnd the eigenstates and
eigenvalues of the operator ˆHSR + ˆHSS. This will give the hyperﬁne level splitting of the
molecular states under joint action of the spin-spin and spin-rotation interactions. In the
case of ortho states one has to diagonalize the 16x16 matrix. For the para states one has
to diagonalize the 8x8 matrix. Ortho and para quantum states of the molecule which take
into account the Stark eﬀect and both types of hyperﬁne interactions will be designated as
the τ -basis. As an example, splitting of the ortho state J=9, K=3, M=9 by the spin-spin
and spin-rotation interactions is shown in Fig. 3c. These calculations were done numerically.
One can see from these data that the hyperﬁne interaction lifts completely degeneracy of
the nuclear spin states.

V. CONVERSION SPECTRA

A. Rotational structure in the conversion spectra

For the calculation of the conversion spectra it is important to know the positions of
ortho and para states in 13CH3F. The nuclear spin conversion in 13CH3F is dominated by
mixing of the two level pairs: (J=9, K=3)–(J ′=11, K ′=1) and (20,3)–(21,1) [12,19]. Of
these two level pairs the former has the smaller energy gap (130 MHz) and contributes
nearly 65% to the conversion rate of a free molecule. The states (11,1)–(9,3) are mixed by
the spin-spin interaction only [12]. The spin-rotation interaction does not mix this pair of
states because of the selection rule for the spin-rotation interaction |∆J| ≤ 1 [20].
To describe the rotational structure in the conversion spectra [1] one has to include the
Stark perturbation ˆVSt = −ˆdE into the ˆH0 term of the splitting (1). As a result, an equation
similar to Eq.(2) is obtained but in the µ-basis which accounts for the Stark eﬀect. Note
that the modeling of the oﬀ-diagonal elements of the collision integral (3) will also have
the same form in the µ-basis. Further, one needs to know the matrix elements of the spin-
spin perturbation which mixes ortho and para states of 13CH3F. From the total spin-spin
perturbation (15) only the part, ˆV = ˆHHH + ˆHHF + ˆHHC, produces the ortho-para state
mixing. The matrix elements Vµ′µ in the µ-basis can be calculated using the matrix elements
of ˆV in the α-basis [12] and the relation between these two bases given in Section III.

An overview of the rotational structure in conversion spectra of 13CH3F is shown in
Fig. 4. The spectrum was calculated using Γ = 1.75 · 107 s−1 which corresponds to the gas
pressure 0.1 Torr. (Here and below we use the decoherence rate 1.75 · 108 s−1/Torr [5]). For
such a value of Γ the hyperﬁne structure of molecular states is not important because the

8

line broadening is much larger than the hyperﬁne splitting. At lower pressures the hyperﬁne
level splitting does play an important role, as is shown in the next Section.

B. Hyperﬁne spectra

To calculate the hyperﬁne spectra of spin conversion one has to include both the Stark
terms and the hyperﬁne terms into the operators ˆH(o) and ˆH(p) (see Eq.(11)). This will
result in transformation of the µ-basis of molecular states to the τ -basis. Matrix elements of
the perturbation ˆV between ortho and para states should be calculated in the τ -basis also.
The calculations were done by using the matrix elements of ˆV in the α-basis from [12] and
the matrix which transforms the α-basis to the τ -basis.

The new expression for the conversion rate obtained in this way, which is exactly Eq.(2)
with τ indices instead of α indices, needs further modiﬁcation. The point is that hyperﬁne
structure in the spin conversion spectra can be revealed only at rather low pressures. The
gas pressure should be low enough to make the decoherence rate Γ smaller than the hyperﬁne
splitting. The latter is estimated to be of the order of V . Consequently, the condition Γ <
∼ V
should be fulﬁlled.
As was shown in [8], calculation of the spin conversion rate in ﬁrst order perturbation
theory is not valid if Γ <
∼ V . This is a consequence of the level population saturation by
intramolecular ortho-para states mixing. The saturation eﬀect can be accounted for by using
the new expression for the conversion rate

γ = Xτ ′∈p,τ ∈o

2Γτ ′τ|Vτ ′τ|2
τ ′τ + 4 Γτ ′ τ

Γ2
τ ′τ + ω2

ν |Vτ ′τ|2

(Wτ ′ + Wτ ) ,

(19)

where ν is the rotational relaxation rate which was assumed equal for ortho and para isomers.
Expression (19) is a straightforward generalization of the result [8], where the theory was
developed for the mixing of only one pair of ortho and para states.

As is clear from Eq. (19), the saturation eﬀect is most important for “strong resonances”,
which have large values of the mixing matrix elements Vτ ′τ . As an example of the saturation
eﬀect at work, we show the hyperﬁne structure of the strongest peak in the spectrum of Fig. 4
which results from the crossing of magnetic sublevels M ′=11 and M=9. This hyperﬁne
spectrum is given in Fig. 5. Calculation of the spectrum was performed for the gas pressure
0.1 mTorr, and the ratio Γ/ν = 10. From the spectrum of Fig. 5 one concludes that the
saturation eﬀect can produce substantial broadening of the spectral lines. Consequently,
the hyperﬁne structure in Fig. 5 remains unresolved. Decreasing the gas pressure does not
result in a decrease in the width of the lines.

Nevertheless, well-resolved hyperﬁne spectra of spin conversion can be obtained if one
chooses “weak resonances” having small magnitude of Vτ ′τ . As an example, the hyperﬁne
structure produced by the “weak crossing” of the M ′=7 and M=9 states is shown in Fig. 6.
One can see that in this case the hyperﬁne structure is well resolved. Decreasing the gas
pressure makes the lines even more narrow.

9

It is interesting to understand the accuracy of the simpliﬁed approach to the conversion
spectra in which hyperﬁne splitting of molecular states is not taken into account. In Fig. 7 we
show the pressure dependence of the amplitude of the “strong resonance” (9,3,9)–(11,1,11)
calculated using the simpliﬁed and the present model. One can see that a 10% diﬀerence
in the two amplitudes already appears at 5 mTorr. At the pressure 1 mTorr, the present
model gives one-third the value of the old model.

VI. CONCLUSIONS

A theoretical model of hyperﬁne spectra of nuclear spin conversion has been developed.
Calculations have been performed for the conversion of spin isomers of 13CH3F molecules
subjected to an external electric ﬁeld. The spin-rotation and the spin-spin intramolecular
interactions were taken into account in the calculations.

It has been shown that the hyperﬁne structure of spin conversion spectra can be sub-
stantially distorted by the saturation eﬀect. In the case of “strong resonances” this eﬀect
hides the hyperﬁne structure of the spectra completely. It had been proposed to observe the
hyperﬁne spectra by using “weak resonances” which have small ortho-para matrix elements.
Such weak resonances have been found for the 13CH3F molecules and hyperﬁne spectra for
them have been calculated.

Calculations performed in the present paper have revealed the conditions at which ex-
perimental observation of the hyperﬁne spectra of nuclear spin conversion can be performed.
These conditions include the choice of suitable level crossings and gas pressure. The pressure
at which the hyperﬁne structure of the spectra is resolved appeared to be rather low. This
implies strong limitations to the experimental setup, viz., molecular collisions with the walls
should contribute to the decoherence rate Γ not much more than collisions in the bulk. The
latter should be on the order of 104 s−1 only.

The theoretical model proposed in this paper is rather general.

It can be applied to
molecules having various symmetries without changing its essence. Another possible exten-
sion of the model can be related to the use of the Zeeman eﬀect for the level splitting instead
of the Stark eﬀect considered in the paper.

As an example, we give here the calculation of the matrix elements of ˆHHF . First, let us

express the ˆHHF through the spherical tensors [9]:

HF is the spin-spin operator of the interaction between ﬂuorine and the n-th hydrogen
nuclei; n = 1, 2, 3 denotes the hydrogen nuclei; < . . .| . . . > stands for the Clebsch-Gordan
coeﬃcient.
Calculations of the matrix elements of ˆHHF can be substantially simpliﬁed if one takes
into account that the matrix elements < µ1| ˆH (n)
HF|µ2 > are equal for all n. This can be proven
by applying to these matrix elements the cyclic permutation, P123, of the three equivalent
protons. Taking this simpliﬁcation into account one has
< µ1| ˆHHF|µ2 > = 3 < µ1| ˆH (1)

FIG. 1. Schematic of the ortho and para states of the CH3F molecule. It is assumed that only
one pair of ortho and para states (m− n) is mixed by an intramolecular perturbation ˆV . The bent
lines indicate transitions induced by collisions with gas particles. These collisions do not produce
direct transitions between molecular ortho and para states.

FIG. 2. Orientation of the molecular system of coordinates. It has its origin in the molecular
centre of mass and is oriented by the numbered hydrogen nuclei in such a way that the xy plane
is parallel to the hydrogen plane, the x axis is directed to the H1 atom and the y axis is between
the H1 and H2 atoms. The z axis is directed along the molecular symmetry axis.

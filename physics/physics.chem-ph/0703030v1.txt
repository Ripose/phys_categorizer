Are electron-hole excitations responsible for the R−4 dependence of excitation energy
transfer (NSET) to a nanoparticle?

We study the distance dependence of the rate of electronic excitation energy transfer from a
dye molecule to a metal nanoparticle. Using the spherical jellium model, we evaluate the rates
corresponding to the excitation of l = 1, 2, and 3 modes of the nanoparticle for the case of random
but static averaging over all the orientations of the nanoparticle. Our calculation takes into account
both the electron-hole pair and the collective modes of excitations of the nanoparticle. The rate

follows the conventional R

are observed at shorter distances. The actual rates are found to be higher than the asymptotic R
rates at shorter distances and have an R

rate to energy transfer to plasmons or e-h pair excitations of the nanoparticle.

tional dynamics of biopolymers in the 10-100 ˚A range.
The rate of non-radiative damping of dye molecules near
quencher molecules is found to vary as R−6, where R
is the distance between the donor and the acceptor.
In FRET, energy is transferred from a donor molecule
to an acceptor molecule via the dipole-dipole interac-
tion. The matrix element for interaction is given by
VDA ∝ |¯µD ||¯µA|
where ¯µD and ¯µA are the transition
dipole moment vectors of donor and acceptor. There-
fore, the rate of energy transfer, which is proportional
to the square of the interaction matrix element varies
as R−6. The F¨orster expression for the rate is given
by knr = kr
where kr is the radiative rate and
R0 is the F¨orster radius, which can be expressed as an
overlap integral between the donor emission and acceptor

However, there are reports of deviations from the con-
ventional FRET behaviour in the literature. Two possi-
ble reasons for this are the breakdown of point dipole ap-
proximation, especially for systems with extended tran-
sition densities like polymers5 and the incomplete ori-
entational averaging within the lifetime of the excited
state6. Currently, there has been lot of interest in using
nanoparticles7 as quenching agents due to their tunable
optical properties8. Recently, there have been very inter-

esting observations on nanoparticle surface energy trans-
fer (NSET)9,10 between ﬂuorescein and 1.4 nm diameter
gold nanoparticle, which are kept at ﬁxed distances apart
using double stranded DNA as the spacer. They report
an R−4 dependence of the rate on the distance. Such a
dependence is of great interest as it would more than dou-
ble the range of distances that can be measured. Persson
and Lang (PL)11 had long ago studied the dissipation of
vibrational energy of an oscillating dipole held at a dis-
tance d above the surface of a semi-inﬁnite metal. In this
case, the energy is transferred to electron-hole pair exci-
tations in the metal, which form a continuum, having
all possible energies from zero to inﬁnity. For an exci-
tation energy ω, their density of states is proportional
to ω. PL found the distance dependence to be ∼ d−4
(see also12,13). Following this, it is suggested9,10 that
the observed distance dependence in NSET is due to the
excitation of e-h pairs in the nanoparticle. Further, in
support of this, the authors9,10 point out that plasmonic
absorptions have not been observed for a gold nanopar-
ticle of diameter 1.4 nm. However, unlike a semi-inﬁnite
metal, a nanoparticle of such a small size, does not have
a continuum of possible excitations. The excitations are
discrete (see the excitation spectrum given in Fig. 2 of
this article). In view of this, it would be very interesting
to study the distance dependence of NSET theoretically.

There have been attempts to explain the R−4 depen-
dence for the case of nanoparticle14,15,16. However, these
papers focus on energy transfer to the plasmons of the
nanoparticle and ﬁnd a predominantly R−6 dependence.
e-h pair excitations are not accounted for. To the best of
our knowledge, there are no reports of theoretical calcula-
tions which take plasmons as well as e-h excitations of the
nanoparticle into account. Therefore, we have calculated
the rate of transfer of electronic excitation from an ex-
cited ﬂuorescein molecule to a 1.4 nm nanoparticle, tak-
ing both the e-h pair excitations as well as the plasmonic
excitations of the nanoparticle into account. We model
the nanoparticle within the jellium model17, and use
time dependent local density approximation (TDLDA)
to calculate the excitations of the nanoparticle. This ap-
proach accounts for both e-h pair and plasmon excita-

tions. Within this framework, we do not get an R−4
dependence of the rate that is experimentally observed.
Therefore, in our opinion, this very interesting experi-
mental observation is, as it stands, unexplained. Per-
haps, it may be due to other factors, like transfer through
the DNA, or the asphericity of the nanoparticle. These
are being currently investigated. It is also to be noted
that the distances between the donor and the acceptor in
the NSET experiment are much greater than the dimen-
sions of the donor and acceptor, making it unlikely that
the breakdown of point dipole approximation is respon-
sible for the R−4 dependence.

II. MODEL FOR THE NANOPARTICLE

We use the spherical jellium model for the nanopar-
ticle which provides a model system for investigating
the response of the conduction electrons in small metal
particles18,19.
In this model, the positive ions of the
metal cluster are replaced by a uniform sphere of pos-
itive charge and the density functional formalism within
the linear response approximation is used to calculate the
response of the cluster to the time dependent external po-
tential. Two kinds of excitations are possible for a metal
cluster namely, single particle excitations and plasmonic
excitations.
In a single particle excitation, an electron
is excited from an occupied level to an unoccupied level
and these are the electron-hole pair excitations. Plas-

3

(1)

(2)

monic excitations are the collective oscillations involving
many electrons, wherein the electronic charge density os-
cillates as a whole against the positive background.
We denote the Hamiltonian of the nanoparticle as H0.
The molecule is treated within a single particle model,
where an electron which was sitting in an orbital φg
has been excited to an orbital φe. De-excitation of the
molecule, may be thought of as a time dependent poten-
tial acting on the nanoparticle, given by

In the above, ω is the frequency of the transition. Thus
the total Hamiltonian can be written as:

One can carry out an expansion of the electrostatic po-

Thus the perturbation acting on the nanoparticle is a
combination of multipole ﬁelds of the form rlY ∗
l,m(Ω) for
various values of l and m. The case of such perturba-
tions acting on nanospheres of jellium is well studied in
the literature21. For a spherically symmetric closed-shell
system22, the perturbation rlY ∗
l,m(Ω) can only lead to the
excitation of the lmth mode in the nanoparticle.

the nanoparticle have the same symmetry as the pertur-

IV. CALCULATIONS

We have optimized the geometry of ﬂuorescein, us-
ing the Gaussian03 program, within the DFT approxi-
mation (B3LYP-6-31G*). The HOMO (φg) and LUMO
(φe) were taken from the calculation for the optimised
geometry. These orbitals were then used to evaluate the
matrix elements Ml,m numerically for all m with l upto

(Φl

3. Note that l = 1 corresponds to the oscillation of the
electrons in the nanoparticle that has the shape of a p-
orbital, l = 2 that of a d-orbital and l = 3 that of an
f-orbital. We assumed an Au cluster of 90 atoms which
corresponds to a 1.4 nm gold nanoparticle and performed
the jellium model calculation to evaluate Π0
ext, ω) and
ΠRP A
ext, ω). We have taken rs = 3 atomic units
l
(au). The broadening parameter Γ, which determines
the width of the single particle peaks was taken to be
0.01 eV . The rate was calculated using Eq. (13), for the
case of static but random averaging over all the orienta-
tions of the nanoparticle. Thus, we have evaluated the
rate of energy transfer from the ﬂuorescein molecule to
the 1.4 nm gold nanoparticle as a function of distance.

V. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The rate of energy transfer depends on the values of
the two terms Ml,m and Sl(ω). The ﬁrst one represents
the perturbing potential acting on the nanoparticle due
to the charge density of the dye molecule and the second
one is the response of the nanoparticle to the perturba-
tion. We have evaluated Sl(ω) for l = 1, 2 and 3 modes of
excitations of the nanoparticle, for both the single parti-
cle and the RPA response using the JELLYRPA program
of Bertsch19. Plots of Sl(ω) calculated using the single
particle and RPA approaches is shown in Figs. 2, 3 and
4 for l = 1, 2 and 3 modes respectively. The RPA plots
clearly show peaks corresponding to e-h pair excitations,
collective surface plasmon and bulk plasmon excitations.
The numerous narrow spikes at lower energies correspond
to e-h pair excitations. The peak around ω/ωB ≃ 0.5 is
the remnant of the surface plasmon and the one around
ω/ωB ≃ 1.2 corresponds to the bulk plasmon. Note that
the frequency of a surface plasmon mode24 is related to
that of the bulk plasmon mode as ωS = ωB
2l+1 . The
surface plasmon mode is slightly red shifted while the
bulk plasmon mode is slightly blue shifted. The shifts are
consistent with previous jellium model calculations18,21.
The quantities of interest to us, in the calculation of the
rate of energy transfer to the nanoparticle are Sl(ω) for
l = 1, 2 and 3, with ω having the value of emission energy
of the dye particle. The Sl(ω) are given in Table 1.
After evaluating Ml,m numerically for all m with l upto
3, we evaluated the rates of transfer corresponding to the
l = 1 , 2 and 3 modes of excitation of the nanoparticle,
both for the single particle as well as the RPA response

l

and the results are shown in Fig. 5 and Fig. 6. Note
that our calculations are not valid if the nanoparticle
penetrates into the charge density of the dye molecule.
Moreover, in such a case, overlap eﬀects dominate and
one has to think of the Dexter mechanism and evalu-
ate the exchange integral. The rates for l = 1, 2 and 3
modes vary with distance as R−6, R−8 and R−10 as may
be seen from the slopes in Fig. 5. Then, we evaluated
the total rate of transfer, again for single particle as well
as RPA response. Asymptotically, at large distances, it
is only the l = 1 mode that is important and this leads
to the conventional ∼ R−6 limit for the total rate. But,
at shorter distances, l = 2 and 3 modes gain importance
leading to deviations from R−6 behaviour at shorter dis-
tances. To make this clearer, we ﬁtted the long distance
rate with c
R6 and used the result to calculate the short
distance rate. The resultant rate is shown in Fig. 7,
along with the actual rate. The actual rates are found to
be higher and have an R−n dependence with n > 6. This
is due to the fact that l = 2 and 3 modes become impor-
tant at lower distances. Note that the deviations are not
such as to give an R−4 dependence. It is also of interest
to note that the R dependence is governed by |Ml,m|2
and not by Sl(ω). Use of a diﬀerent set of values of rs,
or ω would not change the R dependence. Therefore, we
conclude that excitation of plasmons or e-h pairs cannot
lead to the observed experimental data.

VI. CONCLUSIONS

5

We have adopted the spherical jellium model to eval-
uate both the independent particle and the collective re-
sponse of the conduction electrons of the nanoparticle to
the external perturbation provided by the charge density
of the dye molecule. We have evaluated the rates of non-
radiative energy transfer leading to the excitation of l =
1, 2 and 3 modes of the nanoparticle. The rates for these
modes vary with distance as R−6, R−8 and R−10 respec-
tively. The total rate asymptotically follows the F¨orster
dependence at large distances. But, at shorter distances,
rate is found to have an R−n dependence with n > 6.
This essentially is due to the fact that l = 2 and 3 modes
become important at shorter distances. The experimen-
tally observed R−4 dependence cannot be explained by
considering the excitation of plasmons or e-h pairs of the
nanoparticle.

Path-integral Monte-Carlo simulations for electronic dynamics on molecular chains:
I. Sequential hopping and super exchange

(Dated: Date: February 2, 2008)

An improved real-time quantum Monte Carlo procedure is presented and applied to describe
the electronic transfer dynamics along molecular chains. The model consists of discrete electronic
sites coupled to a thermal environment which is integrated out exactly within the path integral
formulation. The approach is numerically exact and its results reduce to known analytical ﬁndings
(Marcus theory, golden rule) in proper limits. Special attention is paid to the role of superexchange
and sequential hopping at lower temperatures in symmetric donor-bridge-acceptor systems.
In
contrast to previous approximate studies, superexchange turns out to play a signiﬁcant role only for
extremely high lying bridges where the transfer is basically frozen or for extremely low temperatures
where for weaker dissipation a description in terms of rate constants is no longer feasible. For bridges
with increasing length an algebraic decrease of the yield is found for short as well as for longer bridges.
The approach can be extended to electronic systems with more complicated topologies including
impurities and in presence of external time dependent forces.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Electron transfer (ET) processes are one of the funda-
mental phenomena in complex molecular systems [1], the
most prominent one being the primary step of photosyn-
thesis [2, 3]. In the last decade or so much theoretical
and experimental eﬀorts have been focused on bridged
molecular systems where the transfer from a donor to an
acceptor is mediated by a molecular structure connecting
them [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. Particular attention has been paid
to DNA complexes with to some extent still controversial
results [10]. Of foremost importance are donor-bridge-
acceptor (DBA) systems in the strongly rising ﬁeld of
molecular electronics [11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. Based on ad-
vanced methods of synthetic chemistry, nowadays, bridge
units with speciﬁc chemical and physical properties can
be produced and linked to donor/acceptor species or con-
tacted with metal leads and thus integrated into electrical
circuits.

Since the pioneering work of Marcus and Jortner
[1, 2, 3] the inﬂuence of residual vibronic modes and a
solvent environment on the ET is known to be extremely
crucial. In fact, the presence of a dissipative surround-
ing is the prerequisite for a directed (irreversible) trans-
port across DBA complexes meaning that bath param-
eters such as temperature and spectral densities have a
sensitive impact [16, 17]. Accordingly, basically two dis-
tinct transport channels have been identiﬁed. For high
lying and short bridges quantum mechanical tunneling
gives rise to a superexchange mechanism associated with
a characteristic exponentially decreasing yield with in-
creasing bridge length. If the bridge is suﬃciently long,
however, sequential transfer processes (hopping) domi-
nate based on thermal activation. Theoretically the com-
petition between these channels has been investigated

∗email: lothar.muehlbacher@physik.uni-freiburg.de

based on Redﬁeld theory and simple system+reservoir
models in Ref. [4] and more recently in Refs. [5, 6, 8]. In
these studies the mentioned exponential length depen-
dence as well as an algebraic decrease of the transfer rate
in case of a sequential mechanism has been found empir-
ically. This latter behavior has been also derived explic-
itly from a more rigorous formulation in Ref. [9]. In most
of these previous studies symmetric DBA systems were
considered with degenerate donor/acceptor and degener-
ate bridge states since they already display the essential
features and make the analysis particularly transparent.
Additional simplifying assumptions about the nature of
the thermal bath coupled to the ET have been invoked to
obtain explicit results since, as for most dissipative quan-
tum systems [18], a numerical description is extremely
demanding.

Indeed, it has been one of the major challenges in re-
cent years in physics and chemistry to develop eﬃcient
algorithms to get access to a detailed analysis of these
systems. As shown ﬁrst by Feynman and Vernon [19]
and in the 1980s by Caldeira and Leggett [20], the path
integral representation is particularly suited as a starting
point. Namely, for Gaussian bath ﬂuctuations the envi-
ronmental degrees of freedom can be eliminated exactly
leading to the reduced system dynamics. In contrast to
perturbative approaches as e.g. Redﬁeld theory this for-
mulation has the merit of being applicable down to zero
temperature, to adiabatic bath modes, and strong fric-
tion. A direct numerical evaluation of the correspond-
ing path integral expression for the density matrix is not
possible though. The reason for that are the interac-
tions, non-local in time, among forward and backward
paths generated by the bath degrees of freedom. Typi-
cally, the range of these interactions grows with ¯hβ. An
eﬃcient numerical approach that relies on a ﬁnite inter-
action range for suﬃciently high temperatures has been
developed by Makri and co-workers [21] and applied to a
variety of systems meanwhile.

Presently, the only numerically exact approach is given

by path integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) simulations [22]. It
has been successfully applied to the spin-boson system to
study e.g. the inﬂuence of nonequilibrium initial bath dis-
tributions [23], the role of vibronic and electronic coher-
ences [23, 24], and electronic transfer rates in large ranges
of parameter space [25]. For a DBA system with one in-
termediate electronic site (three-state system) which can
be seen as simple model for the primary charge separa-
tion of photosynthesis PIMC results could describe most
of the experimental key features [26]. One fundamental
problem of the PIMC, though, is intimately connected
with the constitutive role of interferences in quantum me-
chanical systems. Known as the dynamical sign problem
[22], it turns out that the number of sample paths needed
to achieve a suﬃcient signal-to-noise ratio increases ex-
ponentially with the simulated system time. To partially
circumvent this drawback various techniques have been
introduced and shown to stabilize the simulations con-
siderably [26, 27, 28, 29, 31].

The goal of this paper is twofold: On the one hand
the challenge is to present a PIMC approach applicable
to larger discrete systems and longer simulation times in
order to lay the basis to treat bridge systems with more
electronic sites, a complicated topology including impuri-
ties, and/or in presence of external periodic driving. On
the other hand, motivated by the above mentioned works
on symmetric bridges, our intention is to investigate the
role of the superexchange and the sequential mechanisms
in ET within a complete system+reservoir model and
with a numerically exact approach. This way, we avoid
simplifying assumptions about the bath, the system-bath
coupling, or the structure of the bath along the molecular
bridge. Accordingly, our results can directly be compared
with analytical rate expressions derived within Marcus
theory [18], golden rule approaches [32], or cluster ex-
pansion methods [33]. Surprisingly, such an analysis of
numerical results within the context of the available the-
oretical ﬁndings is still missing.

nearest neighbor coupling ∆.

II. THEORY

A. Dynamics of the dissipative d-level system

We investigate the dynamics of a single electron mov-
ing on a chain of d = 2S + 1 discrete sites, labeled by
a discrete variable −S ≤ s ≤ S with spacing 1, sep-
arated by equal distances a but arbitrary energies ¯hǫs
(see Fig. 1). Electronic motion is facilitated through
tunneling between sites s and s′, with a real tunneling
amplitude ∆s,s′ . The electronic coordinate can then be
expressed as

where −S ≤ s(t) ≤ S. The position operator thus is
equivalent to the spin S operator

q(t) = a · s(t) ,

aSz|si = as|si ,

with |si denoting the (orthonormal) localized electronic
states. In terms of electron transfer, |−Si and |Si repre-
sent the donor and acceptor, respectively, while the other
states are referred to as the bridge states.

The free d-level system (dLS) Hamiltonian can then be

written as

HdLS = ¯hEz − ¯hSx ,

where Ez describes the energetic distribution of the elec-
tronic sites according to

Ez|si = ǫs|si ,

while Sx governs the tunneling,

The paper is organized as follows: We start in Sec. II
by deﬁning the system and the bath and introducing its
path integral representation. In Sec. III the connection to
the description in terms of Master equations is revealed
and known results for the electronic transfer rates are dis-
cussed. Then, in Sec. IV the PIMC used and developed
in this paper is presented, which leads to a substantial
improvement in eﬃciency compared to previous PIMC
schemes. Only this allows us to study in Sec. V ﬁrst
the three-state system and then complexes with longer
bridges in detail, particularly with very good signal to
noise ratio and larger times. A Conclusion contains our
main results and some remarks about subsequent work.

Sx =

∆s,s′ ( |sihs′| + |s′ihs| ) .

(5)

Of particular importance is the case of nearest neighbor
tunneling only with

Sx|si = ∆s−1,s|s − 1i + ∆s,s+1|s + 1i
for −S < s < S ,

Sx|−Si = ∆−S,−S+1|−S + 1i ,
Sx|Si = ∆S,S+1|S − 1i .

(6)

We already note here that the propagation of the free
d-level system is most conveniently performed not in the

site representation used above, but rather in the eigen-
state representation of HdLS (for details see Sec. IV).
This is completely equivalent to the transformation be-
tween (localized) Wannier states and delocalized molec-
ular orbitals (Bloch states) in inﬁnite tight binding lat-
tices. The site representation is particularly suited, how-
ever, to include the interaction with solvent and vibronic
degrees of freedom which later on will be integrated out.
For this purpose, we embed the dLS in a system-plus-
reservoir model, leading to the total Hamiltonian [18]

The residual degrees of freedom are thus modeled by an
inﬁnite collection of harmonic oscillators, HB, which bi-
linearly couple to the position of the electron (HI ). The
so-called counterterm quadratic in the dLS position op-
erator aSz, which reduces to a physically irrelevant con-
stant for S = 1/2, prevents a renormalization of the elec-
tronic energy levels by the oscillator bath [18]. As dis-
cussed in detail in Refs. [16, 17, 18, 32] this provides a
reasonably accurate description of reality for the great
majority of ET systems. It turns out that for the elec-
tronic dynamics the environmental parameters enter via
the spectral density

which eﬀectively becomes a continuous function of ω for

where β = 1/kBT . For S = 1/2, Eq. (7) represents
the celebrated spin-boson (SB) model, with numerous
applications in solid-state physics [18]. In the special case
of a constant nearest coupling, i.e. ∆s,s′ = δs′−s,1∆ for all
s, s′, the described compound reduces to a generalization
of the SB model, as it in fact then resembles a “spin-
S-boson model” [18].
In the following, we repeatedly
will take advantage of the striking similarity. To make
connection to (classical) two-state ET theory, we also
mention the classical reorganization energy ¯hΛcl of the
Marcus theory [2, 3],

corresponding to an initial density matrix

(12)

with the electron held ﬁxed in state |sii and the bath nor-
malization ZB = Tr{e−βHB } assuring the full system’s
density matrix to be normalized for all times. For a trans-
fer process across the entire chain one typically prepares
the electron initially in the donor state, i.e. |sii = |−Si
[4, 8]. Above, µ is the dipole moment of the electron,
and E denotes the dynamical polarization of the bath
[18], which is equilibrated with respect to the initial po-
sition of the electron. By comparing with Eq. (7), we see
α cαXα. As pointed out in Ref. [25], this
that µE = a
“standard preparation” often used in ET experiments is
P
especially suitable for a theoretical description of thermal
transfer rates.

The present formulation can easily be extended in or-
der to describe the impact of an external time dependent
driving force. This as well as abandoning the restriction
to nearest neighbor coupling will be the subject of a sub-
sequent paper.

B. Path integral representation

The path integral representation provides a formally
exact expression for the dynamics of the electronic pop-
ulation and is thus the starting point for a numerically
exact Monte-Carlo (MC) scheme. The standard proce-
dure is then to eliminate the bath degrees of freedom to
arrive at the reduced dynamics. This can be done ex-
actly due to the harmonic nature of the bath. As shown
in Ref. [18], one thus obtains for Eq. (11)

Here the path integration runs over closed paths ˜s(˜t)
starting at ˜s(0) = si and propagating along the real-time
contour ˜t ∈ 0 → t → 0, which connect the forward and
backward paths s(t′) and s′(t′), respectively. Further-
more, SdLS[s] denotes the total action of the free dLS,
and the inﬂuence of the traced-out bath is encoded in
the Feynman-Vernon inﬂuence functional Φ[s] [19].

The inﬂuence functional introduces long-ranged nonlo-
cal interactions among the dLS paths so that in general
an explicit evaluation of the remaining path integral in
Eq. (13) is possible only numerically. Before we explain
the details of the PIMC scheme in Sec. IV, however, we
focus in the next Section on the description of the popu-
lation dynamics in terms of Master equations with associ-
ated transition rates. Corresponding results will provide
the appropriate tools in order to analyze and understand
the MC data.

III. POPULATION DYNAMICS

A. Master equations

As has been derived in Ref. [33], the dynamics of the
population for a spin-S-boson system can be cast exactly
into the form of a retarded non-local (in time) Master
equation

4

with time dependent transition rates ˜Γs,sk (t) the Laplace
transforms of which are given by appropriate cluster func-
tions. Provided the dissipative inﬂuence is suﬃciently
strong or temperature suﬃciently high, the electronic dy-
namics (16) can be simpliﬁed to a conventional Master
equation. In essence, one invokes a coarse graining pro-
cedure in time so that after some initial transient motion,
i.e. for t > τtrans, the population dynamics obeys

˙Psf ,si(t) =

Γs,si Ps,si (t) .

(17)

Xs=−S

Here, the nearest neighbor transition rates Γs,s±1 are
related to sequential hopping processes, while Γ−S,S
describes direct transfer from donor to acceptor with-
out any real populations in the bridge states (superex-
change).

In the case studied here in more detail, namely, de-
generate donor and acceptor energies (ǫ−S = ǫS = 0),
degenerate bridge energies (ǫ−S+1 = . . . = ǫS−1 = ǫ),
and nearest neighbor tunneling with ∆s,s′ = δs′−s,1∆,
the number of independent rates shrinks considerably.
Eq. (17) becomes particularly simple in case of purely
sequential transport where it can be written as

Here, P = (PD, PB1, . . . , PBb, PA) where PD (PA) refers
to the donor (acceptor) population P−S (PS) and PBi
to the population Pi−S of the b = d − 2 bridge states.
The rate constants ΓDB (ΓBD) govern the sequential
forward (backward) transport between donor and ﬁrst
bridge state, ΓAB (ΓAD) the sequential forward (back-
ward) transport between acceptor and last bridge state,
and ΓB the sequential transport on the bridge. Coher-
ent transport (superexchange) would be accounted for
by additional rate contributions in the upper and lower
triangular of A.

According to Eq. (18) the populations Ps(t) re-

ﬂect multi-exponential dynamics, with the corresponding
rates given by the eigenvalues of the rate matrix A. The
approach to equilibrium happens to be on the relaxation
time scale τR which is the inverse of the smallest of these
eigenvalues ΓR. Forward and backward rates in A are

B. Sequential and superexchange rate expressions

ΓSCL,GR =

ΓAB = ΓDB. The equilibrium occupation probabili-
ties are Boltzmann distributed with respect to an eﬀec-
tive electronic parameter ˜ǫ(β) which, for strong damping
and/or higher temperatures, converges with the physical
bias ǫ [34]. It is then straightforward to calculate Ps(t)
from Eq. (18) or the more general expression (17) which
in the appropriate parameter range gives an accurate de-
scription of the exact dynamics for times t larger than
some transient time scale ttrans. The corresponding ex-
pressions for d = 3 are given in App. B.

Hence, once MC data for the populations are gener-
ated, the associated rate constants are obtained by ﬁtting
the electronic dynamics obtained from Eqs. (18) and (19)
to the numerical data. At suﬃciently low temperatures,
however, coherent oscillations govern the population dy-
namics over a long period of time and the transfer can no
longer be characterized by time independent decay rates.
Outside this range information about the impact of su-
perexchange can be extracted by comparing ﬁts to the
sequential (18) and the complete model (17).

As already noted, basically two transport channels
have been found in previous studies on bridge mediated
ET, namely, a sequential channel and a superexchange
channel. The latter one is expected to dominate for high
lying and suﬃciently short bridges, whereas in other cases
the former one prevails. Here we brieﬂy collect available
analytical results for the transitions rates, particularly
for symmetric DBA systems (degenerate donor and ac-
ceptor energies, degenerate bridge states), to analyze our
PIMC results accordingly (see Sec. V).

In the classical limit ¯hβωc ≪ 1 the sequential forward

rate is given by the well known Marcus result [3]

ΓDB,Marcus =

(21)
with the activation free energy barrier F ∗(ǫ) = ¯h(ǫ +
Λcl)2/(4Λcl) where ǫ = ǫB − ǫA is the energy gap between
bridge and donor (acceptor). As long as a rate descrip-
tion is valid at all, this expression is applicable from the
weak adiabatic domain (ωc < ∆), where it eventually
becomes independent of ∆, to the nonadiabatic range
(ωc ≫ ∆). Recently, for adiabatic to moderate nona-
diabatic environments an extension of this rate expres-
sion to lower temperatures where quantum ﬂuctuations
and nuclear tunneling come into play has been derived in
Ref. [35].

In the quantum domain ¯hβωc >

∼ 1 and for small tun-
neling amplitudes ∆ ≪ ωc (nonadiabatic range) transfer
rates are calculated perturbatively by invoking Fermi’s
golden rule. For the sequential forward rate the result is

with the damping kernel Q(t) speciﬁed in Eq. (34). The
golden rule rate expression reduces for high temperatures
to the nonadiabatic limit of the Marcus formula (21) and
captures nuclear tunneling at low T . Within a pertur-
bative treatment in powers of ∆2n, superexchange rates
appear as higher order contributions n = 2, 3, 4, . . .. In
case of a three-state system with ǫD = ǫA, Γ−1,1 is ob-
tained in leading order n = 2 as [33]

Even for this more involved expression simpliﬁcations
arise in certain limits.
In the high temperature range

IV. SIMULATION METHOD

As already addressed, the time evolution of a dissipa-
tive quantum system can in general not be evaluated an-
alytically. In the past the PIMC method has been proven
as a very promising approach to obtain numerically ex-
act results even in regions of parameter space where other
approximative methods fail. In particular, in recent ex-
periments on molecular wires contacted with metal junc-
tions [36] low temperature measurements down to 30K
have been performed which necessitates the inclusion of
strong quantum eﬀects also in the environment.

For this purpose we turn to the path integral repre-
sentation (13) and employ a discretization described in

detail in Refs. [25, 26]. For the forward and backward
paths the time axis is sliced via q uniformly spaced points
with discretization steps τ = t/q. The path integral in
Eq. (13) then becomes

Q(0) = 0 with ˙Q(0) = iΛcl. Explicitly it is gained from
Eq. (9) to read

In the sequel we consider a spectral density of the form

J(ω) = 2παωe−ω/ωc ,

which is equivalent to ohmic damping with a cut-oﬀ fre-
quency ωc. In this case Q(t) can be calculated analyti-
cally and one obtains

which can be easily computed numerically once the dLS’s
parameters are speciﬁed. Another advantage of this for-
mulation is that it can be immediately applied to all
quantum systems which can be mapped eﬀectively onto
a dLS, e.g. by a proper reduction of its Hilbert space.

To arrive at a discretized form of the inﬂuence func-

tional (14), the sum and diﬀerence coordinates

η(t′) ≡ s(t′) + s′(t′) ,

ξ(t) ≡ s(t′) − s′(t′)

(31)

are introduced, which read η(t′) = ηj (ξ(t′) = ξj ) for
t′ ∈ [(j−1)τ −τ /2, (j−1)τ +τ /2] in their discretized form.
The sum paths are also considered as “quasi-classical”,
while the diﬀerence paths capture quantum ﬂuctuations
[18, 26]. Equation (14) ﬁnally can be written as

Φ[si, η, ξ] = i

with Ω = 1 + 1/(¯hβωc) and the Gamma function Γ(z).

Equations (26), (27) and (32) constitute a discretized
form of the populations (11) and thus provide a starting
point for PIMC simulations. Unfortunately, this method
is handicapped by the dynamical sign problem [22]. It
originates from quantum interferences between diﬀerent
system paths {sj}, causing a small signal-to-noise ra-
tio of the stochastic averaging procedure: The exponen-
tial increase of the paths’ conﬁguration space with the
maximum real time under study results in an exponen-
tial decrease of the signal-to-noise ratio. Various proce-
dures to mitigate the sign problem have been proposed
in the past, like maximum entropy methods [27], ﬁlter
techniques [28, 29] or the multilevel blocking approach
[25, 31]. Here we employ a ﬁlter technique optimized for
dissipative spin systems as suggested by Egger and Mak
[26] which exploits the special symmetries of the inﬂuence
functional.

The backbone of this approach is the observation that
the absence of a self-energy like term for the quasi-
classical paths {ηj} in Eq. (32) allows to express the
summation over the latter as a series of q − 1 matrix
multiplications. This usually requires drastically less
computational eﬀort than performing the correspond-
ing sums in Eq. (26) and thus can be carried out ex-
It reduces the degrees of freedom from the

Here, the sum over the {ηj≤q} has been written as a
product over the q matrices ˆK (j), where the ﬁrst (last)
of them is only a row (column) vector due to η1 ≡ 2si
(ηq+1 ≡ 2sf ). This matrix product can be performed
explicitely such that only the sum over the quantum
variables {ξj}2≤j≤q has to be evaluated by PIMC sim-
ulations. The resulting mitigation of the sign problem
allows for numerically stable simulations which consume
signiﬁcantly less CPU time than corresponding ones eval-
uating the standard expression (26). Moreover, another
considerable speedup can be gained by optimizing the
MC weight with respect to the dissipative regime (see
App. A).

We note in passing that the above described ap-
proach also resembles the multilevel blocking strategy
[30]: On the ﬁrst level, the harmonic bath degrees of
freedom are integrated out, while on the second level the
quasi-classical coordinates get eliminated; the addend in
Eq. (38) then corresponds to the respective level-2 bonds.
It furthermore seems noteworthy that, while here we
only present results for electronic systems with constant
nearest-neighbor coupling, ∆s,s′ = δs′−s,1∆, the above
outlined approach is suitable for arbitrary electronic sys-
tems as long as they can be described by a ﬁnite Hilbert
space. Corresponding applications will be shown in a
subsequent paper.

V. NUMERICAL RESULTS

Next we present results for a symmetric donor-bridge-
acceptor (DBA) system (degenerate donor and acceptor
energies, degenerate bridge states with energy gap ¯hǫ be-
tween bridge and donor/acceptor) with constant nearest
neighbor coupling obtained from PIMC simulations as

7

described above. Albeit its simplicity this model cap-
tures essential features of bridge mediated ET and can
serve as a basis for more elaborate studies. In part, this
work was motivated by former theoretical approaches on
symmetric DBA systems [4, 8, 9] which, however, re-
lied on simpler system+reservoir models and/or approx-
imate numerical methods. In particular, in contrast to
these latter, the formulation (7) takes the dynamics of
the vibronic structure of the DBA compound fully into
account. Further, the MC approach is not plagued by
the limitations of Redﬁeld theory, but rather applies also
to low temperatures, slower bath modes, and stronger
dissipation. Hence, it reproduces in the proper limits the
known analytical ﬁndings speciﬁed in Sec. III B.

Clearly, the ET process considered here eventually
leads to thermal equilibration of the electronic sites. Due
to the relation between relaxation rates and conductances
in stationary non-equilibrium [14], our results give also
insight, at least qualitatively, into ET through metal-
molecule-metal junctions. In fact, to get quantitative re-
sults, the present approach can in principle be extended
to the latter case by eliminating the electronic states in
the metal contacts as an additional bath. Corresponding
work is in progress.

The superexchange mechanism is a truly quantum me-
chanical coherence phenomenon. Thus, in order to inves-
tigate this scenario in more detail within the MC ap-
proach, we choose parameters such that for lower tem-
peratures the population dynamics exhibits coherent os-
cillations, while for slightly higher T , with a bath that
is still quantum mechanically, a rate description is ap-
plicable. We take a damping coeﬃcient α = 1/4 well
below the coherent-incoherent transition α = 1/2 [18]
and a moderate cut-oﬀ frequency ωc/∆ = 5 so that adi-
abatic eﬀects are expected to show up. Note that the
cutoﬀ frequency ωc also deﬁnes the maximum of the spec-
tral density distribution (35), such that even frequencies
somewhat larger than ωc contribute. The classical reor-
ganization energy follows as Λcl = 2αωc = 2.5∆. Ac-
cordingly, we expect superexchange, if important, to be
particularly pronounced.

To conﬁrm the proper choice of the above parameters
and to ﬁx the temperature range where a description
in terms of rate constants applies, we start by present-
ing results for the equilibrium bridge population P ∞
B of
a three-state system at a ﬁxed bridge energy ǫ/∆ = 5
for varying temperature. As can be seen by comparing
P ∞
B obtained from imaginary-time MC simulations with
a simple Boltzmann distribution, i.e. 1/[2 exp(βǫ)+1], de-
viations occur for ¯hβ∆ > 0.3 related to the strong inﬂu-
ence of quantum delocalization (see Fig. 2). This triggers
the tendency of coherent oscillations in the population
dynamics which becomes especially obvious for an ener-
getically degenerated bridge (see Fig. 3). Damped oscil-
lations are clearly observable in the intermediate state for
¯hβ∆ > 0.3. These results verify that (i) with the above
choice of parameters electronic coherent eﬀects are cru-
cial and (ii) that the ET dynamics can be captured by

transfer rates for ¯hβ∆ < 0.3. With respect to the bath, a
typical temperature ¯hβ∆ = 0.1 corresponds at the max-
imum ωmax = ωc of the spectral density to ¯hβωmax = 0.5
so that a high temperature approximation does not ap-
ply. The simulations have been performed for system
times long enough and suﬃcient stochastical accuracy to
allow for studying details of the dynamics even close to
the approach of equilibrium.

Having ﬁxed the proper range of parameters, we now
turn to a detailed analysis of the population dynam-
ics. First, we consider a three-state system with varying
bridge energy 0 ≤ ǫ/∆ ≤ 20 and at a ﬁxed tempera-
ture ¯hβ∆ = 0.1 (Fig. 4). For bridges with ǫ/∆ ≤ 7.5
the intermediate state approaches thermal equilibrium
within the simulation period. Interestingly, a bridge en-
ergy ǫ/∆ = 2.5 leads to an increase of the acceptor popu-
lation almost as fast as for the degenerate case ǫ/∆ = 0.
This is due to the fact that for the former bridge the equi-
librium population P ∞
A is larger while the bridge is still
not high enough to considerably reduce the donor-bridge
rate ΓDB. The population dynamics for this system can
now be analyzed with the full (17) and the sequential (18)
model to extract the rate constants for times t > ttrans.
The rate constants were then obtained by repeating this
procedure for successively increasing ttrans such that the
corresponding rates eventually saturate at plateau val-
ues. The latter are depicted in Fig. 5 where also the
nonadiabatic classical Marcus (21) and the golden rule
(22) results are shown. The numerical results basically
follow the latter ones with minor deviations that can be
attributed to adiabatic eﬀects (e.g. recrossing phenom-
ena) not included in the golden rule rate expression. Se-
quential rates are extracted for all three electronic states
where those obtained from the donor and acceptor co-
incide while rates extracted from the bridge exceed the

former by about 5-10%. This deviation signals a short-
coming of Eqs. (18) and (19) in this parameter regime.
In fact, the reduction of Eq. (16) to Eq. (17) is in a strict
sense only justiﬁed in the strongly damped regime. The
impact of superexchange, however, is very weak and its
corresponding rates are smaller by two orders of magni-
tude. Accordingly, the sequence of superexchange rates
for various ttrans obtained from the ﬁtting procedure de-
scribed above does not saturate but rather strongly ﬂuc-
tuates such that a quantitative description is out of range.
This behavior can be understood from the analyti-
cal rate expressions. Namely, upon closer inspection
of Eqs. (24) and (21) one derives that in the classical
regime ΓSCL,GR dominates against the sequential trans-
fer ΓDB,Marcus whenever ¯hβǫ ≫ 1 and ǫ ≫ Λcl such that

(39)

This veriﬁes the expected and well-known fact that for
a classical bath the superexchange mechanism prevails
whenever thermal activation from D to B is suppressed.
For a quantum bath, however, the situation is more
restrictive. From Eq. (23) one estimates ΓSQM,GR ∝
∆4/(ωcǫ2) for ¯hβωc > 1 (and α of order 1) such that
for ﬁxed temperature ¯hβ∆ < 0.5 superexchange trans-
port prevails only for extremely high bridge energies,
i.e. ǫ/∆ > 40, where the transfer is essentially frozen
on the time scale accessible in MC simulations and in
realistic experiments. With electronic couplings of the
order of 100 cm−1 [4, 8], the above condition requires at
T ≃ 150 K bridge energies of the order of ǫ ≈ 5000 cm−1
leading to typical transfer times of the order of 30 µs.
Having in mind that our primary focus is to identify re-
gions where one of the transfer channels, sequential or
superexchange, dominates, superexchange turns out to

be negligible in Fig. 4.

At least as a minor eﬀect we ﬁnd superexchange in
the ET dynamics shown in Fig. 4 for ǫ/∆ ≥ 5. We
thus performed simulations for ﬁxed bridge energy, but
varying temperature 0.05 ≤ ¯hβ∆ ≤ 0.5, see Fig. 6.
As already mentioned, for ¯hβ∆ > 0.3 a rate descrip-
tion is questionable as the bridge population shows signs
of coherent oscillations. Sequential rates are extracted
according to the above scheme from donor and accep-
tor as well (cf. Fig. 7). The results are in qualitative
agreement with the golden rule description with devi-
ations between donor and acceptor rates appearing in
the low temperature range where quantum coherences
exist. All numerical rates are below the nonadiabtic val-
ues, again due to adiabatic eﬀects in the bath dynam-
ics. Superexchange cannot be found. This is under-
stood from the above discussion: For ﬁxed ǫ the ana-
lytical superexchange rate exceeds the golden rule one
only in the temperature range ¯hβ∆ ≫ 2 ln(ǫ/∆)/(ǫ/∆)
corresponding to low temperatures ¯hβ∆ ≫ 0.6 where,
as seen above, for weaker dissipation (α < 1/2) a rate
description is in a strict sense no longer feasible. The sit-
uation changes when donor and acceptor are biased with
an energy gap ǫDA = ǫD − ǫA > 0. Then, based on the
generalization of Eq. (23) for ǫDA 6= 0 [33] one can show
for a high lying intermediate state that superexchange
exceeds sequential transport already at higher tempera-
tures ¯hβ∆ ≫ 2ln(ǫ/∆)/[(ǫDA + ǫ)/∆]. In fact, for biased
ET systems indications of superexchange have already
been seen in previous MC simulations for three-state sys-
tems [26].

Let us now turn to longer bridges with b = d − 2 > 1.
The stability of the MC procedure allows to extract rate
constants for systems up to b = 10. In Fig. 8 results for
b = 1 up to b = 10 bridge states are displayed. Appar-
ently, the donor dynamics basically saturates for b > 2
on the time scale of the simulations meaning that the
donor decay depends on the bridge length only at very
large times and then only slightly. This amounts to the
fact that the equilibrium populations decrease only al-
gebraically with b.
In contrast, the time evolution of
the acceptor and its closest bridge states are strongly af-
fected by the varying bridge length. The numerical data
can be very precisely reproduced by a sequential trans-
fer model according to Eq. (18) where due to symme-
try and detailed balance only two ﬁt parameters enter,
namely the forward rate from the donor ΓDB and the
bridge rate ΓB. It turns out that by ﬁxing these param-
eters at ΓDB = 0.284 and ΓB = 0.348 all populations
independent of the bridge length can be described, thus
verifying that the transport is more or less completely
sequential. The nonadiabatic golden rule formula (22)
predicts a little bit higher values ΓDB,GR = 0.297 and
ΓB,GR = 0.37 in agreement with our ﬁndings for the
three-state system. Our main focus lies on the behavior
of the smallest eigenvalue of the rate matrix A, i.e. the
relaxation rate ΓR, as the bridge length b increases. Since
an analytical diagonalization of A for arbitrary b is not

In Ref. [9] it was found that µr/µd = b. Since ΓDB is
independent of the bridge length, the ratio µd can be
inferred from the mean ﬁrst passage time of a particle
diﬀusing across a one-dimensional wire [37]. This scales
like b2 so that µd = 1/(ν b2) where ν is a constant. Based
on these results two scenarios for ΓR(b) can be distin-
guished. For short and moderate long bridges with b
suﬃciently smaller than 1/ν (µd > 1), Eq. (40) gives rise
to Γ(b) ≈ ΓDB 2/(1+b), while for longer bridges b ≫ 1/ν
(µd ≪ 1) the approximation ΓR(b) ≈ ΓDB 2/(ν b2) ap-
plies. In the ﬁrst case the bottleneck of the transfer pro-
cess is the donor-bridge activation encoded in ΓDB, in

(open diamonds). The solid line resembles Eq. (42). The
rates in the inset correspond to the golden rule rate (22).

the latter one the rate is limited by the diﬀusive motion
along the entire bridge described by Γd. An eﬀective for-
mula comprising these limiting cases is given by

ΓR(b) ≈ ΓDB

1 + b + ν b2 .

(42)

Indeed, the numerical data shown in Fig. 9 are quan-
titatively captured by the result (42) with ν = 0.159.
Due to this excellent agreement between sequential trans-
fer model and the PIMC data on the one hand and be-
tween the corresponding relaxation rates and the expres-
sion (40) on the other hand, we extracted the relaxation
rate from the full rate matrix A for bridges with up to
b = 100 and conﬁrmed the validity of Eq. (40).

A functional behavior of the form ΓR(b) ∝ 1/b has been
noted empirically already in Ref. [8], derived theoretically
in Ref. [9] (in a slightly diﬀerent model though), and
observed experimentally in a variety of molecular sys-
tems [7, 11, 14]. In lead-molecule-lead junctions it gives
rise to Ohm’s law in the current voltage characteristics.
Our above ﬁndings indicate that, at least in symmetric
DBA systems, this behavior is characteristic for situa-
tions where ΓDB is suﬃciently smaller than the bridge
diﬀusion rate. However, a changeover to Γ(b) ∝ 1/b2
should be observable for very long bridges.

VI. CONCLUSIONS

Electron transfer processes across molecular chains
have gained much interest in recent years, particularly in
the context of molecular electronics. Motivated by previ-
ous studies, in this paper the electronic dynamics across
symmetric donor-bridge-acceptor systems has been an-
alyzed based on a numerically exact treatment of the
corresponding dissipative quantum system within a real-
time MC scheme.

12

Upon improving existing ﬁlter techniques we have been
able to achieve accurate data for the population dynam-
ics even for times where equilibration sets in or has al-
ready been established, and for an increasing number of
electronic bridge states. This opens the door to consider
a variety of electronic site topologies as well as the im-
pact of external time dependent ﬁelds. Eventually, by a
proper reduction of the Hilbert space also the reduced dy-
namics of continuous degrees of freedom with a discrete
energy spectrum of the bare system are now accessible.
Corresponding work in this direction is in progress.

Physically, the main issue has been the role of superex-
change and sequential transport in symmetric DBA com-
pounds. Here, results based on Redﬁeld theory and sim-
pliﬁed system-bath couplings indicated diﬀerent regimes
for the length dependence of net transfer across the
bridge comprising an exponential and an algebraic fall-
oﬀ, respectively. The numerical MC data have been an-
alyzed by exploiting the fact that (i) the ET dynamics
can in the range of parameters considered be mapped
onto Master equations with time independent transition
rates and (ii) the path integral formulation reproduces
the known analytical ﬁndings for these rates in certain
limits. For the DBA compound the parameters were cho-
sen to guarantee strong quantum eﬀects, i.e. moderate
dissipation, suﬃciently low temperatures, and a broad
distribution of bath modes.

The conclusion of the numerical results together with
the analytical ﬁndings is that in a symmetric DBA sys-
tem (degenerate donor and acceptor energy) even for
weaker dissipation superexchange can be expected to
dominate only for classical or nearly classical bath. For
quantum mechanical baths as they have been studied
here,
it does not play a signiﬁcant role for ET pro-
cesses that can be captured by time independent trans-
port rates. Particularly, in contrast to earlier studies
we found no dominant role of the superexchange mech-
anism neither for relatively high lying bridges, nor for
lower temperatures or more bridge sites. For quantum
baths it requires extremely high lying bridge states with
essentially frozen dynamics or temperatures that are so
low that coherences give rise to oscillating population
dynamics associated with a breakdown of a conventional
rate description. Experimentally, a clear observation of a
changeover from tunneling to hopping dominated trans-
fer in molecular chains has not been found yet, a fact,
that may to some extent be attributed to the scenario
we have revealed. The results reported in Ref. [7] show
some indications but not a direct proof though, since the
energetic landscape of the molecular structures changes
with their length. By varying the number of bridge sites
an algebraic decrease of the relaxation rate could be con-
ﬁrmed for shorter as well as longer bridges. Based on a
reduced DBA model we ﬁnd a changeover from a range
where the donor-bridge activation limits the transfer to a
domain where the nondirectional diﬀusive motion along
the wire is decisive. Previous simulations on biased three-
state systems suggest in accordance with the analytical

results that an energy gap between donor and acceptor
(in addition to the energy gap between the bridge and
donor/acceptor) stimulates the occurrence of superex-
change.

which essentially neglect all dissipative eﬀects. Although
MC runs utilizing ˜wMC exhibit somewhat poorer statis-
tics than those using wMC, the switching from complex
to real-valued matrices which furthermore, unlike the
ˆK (j), can be calculated and stored before executing the
MC moves results in a signiﬁcant speedup of the simula-
tions. In fact, for the parameters investigated here, using
Eq. (A5) over (A4) could reduce the computational costs
by a factor of roughly four. Note that the restriction
of the use of ˜wMC to the weakly damped regime does
not really impose a severe limitation since for suﬃciently
strong dissipation the overall sign problem will be weak
enough to be tackled by any conventional PIMC scheme.

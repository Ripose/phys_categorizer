ABSTRACT

For a particular case of three-body scattering in 2 dimensions, we demonstrate an-
alytically that the behaviour of the adiabatic potential is diﬀerent from that of the
hyperspherical coupling matrix elements, thereby leading to a phase shift that tends
to zero, as the energy goes to zero, instead of to a constant. We consider two parti-
cles interacting with binary repulsive step potentials, one acting as a spectator, and
solve analytically for the adiabatic eigenvalues and eigenvectors, for all values of ρ. We
are thereby able to obtain the leading terms in the long range behaviour of the eﬀec-
tive potentials, and conﬁrm its inverse logarithmic nature, suggested from a previous
numerical study.

Introduction

In a previous paper[1], the authors show how, starting from hyperspherical harmonic
expansions, they obtained adiabatic potentials, suitable for the calculations of three-
body phase shifts at low energies. The calculations were for 3 particles in a plane,
subject to ﬁnite repulsive core interactions.

The calculations were meant to establish a method which would lead to the eval-
uation, at low temperature, of a third fugacity coeﬃcient in Statistical Mechanics.
The latter task was subsequently carried out by Jei Zhen and one of the authors[2].
In both investigations, it was important to consider diﬀerent cases, corresponding to
the distinct representations of the permutation group and diﬀerent physical situations,
with either the 3 particles interacting or simply two of them interacting, with the third
acting as a spectator.

Absolutely crucial, in these investigations, is the large-ρ behaviour of the adiabatic
potentials. The nature of the long “tail” of the adiabatic potential determines how
the correspondent eigenphase shift behaves, as the energy tends to zero. Thus, our
most signiﬁcant result was that for the 3 most important types of the phase shifts,
associated with the cases of 0Γ1g, 0Γ2g and δ, the adiabatic potentials (the adiabatic
eigenvalue minus a centrifugal term) behave as 1/(ρ2lnρ), for large values of ρ, instead
of the 1/ρ2 of the hyperspherical potential matrix elements. This then implies that
the phase shifts, instead of tending to constants as the energy goes to zero, behave as
1/(ln q)2, and therefore go to zero! (The variables ρ and q are, respectively, the hyper
radius and the reduced wave number.)

Though, in our old paper, our basic material was numerical, we were able never-
theless to propose “heuristic” formulae, to characterize the asymptotic behaviour of
the 3 types of eigenpotentials, of the remodeling that takes place to yield a diﬀerent
scattering from the one expected from the solution of a ﬁnite number of hyperspherical
equations.

In this paper, we present analytical results, where we show that in one of the
three cases mentioned above, the case δ, we succeeded in calculating analytically the
adiabatic eigenvectors and eigenvalues for all the values of ρ, and therefore also in the
asymptotic region.

While this calculation involves a case where only two of the particles interact,
while the 3rd particle acts as a spectator, it is well to note that in the hyperspherical
coordinate system the two-body interaction is long ranged (in ρ) and also that in
the full hyperspherical calculations of the other cases, we only need, using symmetry
and enforcing a restriction on the quantum numbers, to take into account the matrix
element of one of the pair potentials.

Here, then, our calculations allow us to re-examine our previous results, and conﬁrm
and extend the asymptotic form (and coeﬃcients) that can be used to characterize the
long range behaviour of the adiabatic potentials.

For a system of three equal mass particles in two dimensions, we deﬁne the Jacobi
coordinates

and

~ξ =

~r3) ,

which allows us to separate, in the Hamiltonian, the center of mass coordinates from
those associated with the internal motion.

Kilpatrick and Larsen[3] then introduce hyperspherical coordinates, associated with
the moment of inertia ellipsoid, of the 3 particles, which allows them to disentangle
permutations from rotations and obtain harmonics which are pure representations of
both the permutation and the rotation group. Taking the z axis normal to the plane
of the masses, we write for the cartesian components of the Jacobi coordinates

ηx = ρ(cos ϑ cos ϕ cos ψ + sin ϑ sin ϕ sin ψ),
sin ϑ sin ϕ cos ψ),
ηy = ρ(cos ϑ cos ϕ sin ψ
ξx = ρ(cos ϑ sin ϕ cos ψ
sin ϑ cos ϕ sin ψ),
ξy = ρ(cos ϑ sin ϕ sin ψ + sin ϑ cos ϕ cos ψ),

For our model, the particles interact via a binary step potential

V (rij) =

where the height V0, and the range, σ, are both ﬁnite.

The adiabatic eigenfunctions Bl are then deﬁned as satisfying

Bl = λl(ρ)Bl ,

where V (ρ, Ω) is either the sum of the binary potentials or, simply one of the binary
potentials, say V (r12), expressed as a function of ρ and the angles. The index l stands
for the set of quantum numbers which characterize and index the particular class of
solutions. λl(ρ) is the eigenvalue, which upon subtraction of a “centrifugal” type term
yields the eﬀective potential, of concern to us later on.

The eigenfunctions may now be used to expand the wavefunctions of the physical

systems:

Ψ =

Bl′(ρ, Ω)φl′(ρ) ,

where the amplitudes φl(ρ) are the solutions of the coupled equations:

Xl′ Z

The adiabatic eigenfunctions can themselves be expanded in hyperspherical har-
monics and this is how a large set of them were calculated in the papers quoted earlier.
The symmetries of the hyperspherical harmonic basis are, of course, reﬂected in the
solutions of the adiabatic eigenvectors. For the fully symmetric Hamiltonian, the set
of solutions divides into nine separate subsets[2], each requiring calculations involving
combinations of matrix elements of only one of the binary potentials, but with restric-
tions on the quantum numbers of the unsymmetrized harmonics involved. In the case
of two interacting particles, with a third as a spectator, we ﬁnd an additional four
subsets.

The numerical approach was then, for each ρ, to evaluate a large potential ma-
trix, with the appropriate harmonic basis, add to this the (diagonal) “centrifugal”
contribution arising from the angular part of the kinetic energy (the angular part of
the Laplacian in the Hamiltonian) and diagonalize to obtain the required adiabatic
eigenvalues. The number of harmonics, needed for numerical convergence, increases
as a function of ρ, but it was our fortunate experience to ﬁnd that it was possible
to evaluate correctly the eigenvalues, that we sought, for values of ρ large enough
that the behaviour of λl(ρ) could be described by asymptotic forms. We were able to
characterize them, and this gave us the values of λl(ρ) for all the larger values of ρ.

Dual Polar Set of Coordinates

The Harmonic Basis

In this part of the paper we wish, exclusively, to consider the case of two particles
interacting together, the third acting as a spectator. As we shall show, we are then
able to obtain exact adiabatic solutions.

Our reasoning is as follows. When the third particle does not interact with the
other two, this must imply that the motion of the pair (1,2), and therefore its angular
momentum, is unaﬀected by the motion of the third particle. In a parallel fashion, the
motion of the third particle, and its angular momentum about the center of mass of
the particles (1,2), must be a constant as well. If we choose our coordinates carefully,
the angular behaviour of two of the angles should “factor” out and, for a given ρ, only
one variable should be involved in a key diﬀerential equation.

We note that in the KL coordinates, the distances between particles involve two of
the angles, for example r2
12 equals ρ2(1 + cos 2ϑ cos 2ϕ). To get around this, we choose
an angle to give us the ratio of the length of the 2 Jacobi vectors, and then polar
coordinates for each of them. Thus, we represent Ω by (θ1, θ2, φ), where η = ρ cos φ,
ξ = ρ sin φ and ηx = η cos θ1, ηy = η sin θ1, ξx = ξ cos θ2, ξy = ξ sin θ2. The ranges of
these angles are

Comparison of the Adiabatic Eigenvalues

When the numerical work was done (using the KL basis), lists were made of the appro-
priate harmonics needed to form the matrices (potential and centrifugal) which, when
added and diagonalized, yield the adiabatic eigenvalues. We now need to identify these
eigenvalues and compare them with those obtained by the new method. This is not
trivial, but an immediate remark can be made.

First of all, the angular momentum λ is a good quantum number, with

λ = l1 + l2 .

(23)

This follows from the fact that l1 speciﬁes the angular momentum of the 1-2 pair and
l2 speciﬁes the angular momentum of the third particle relative to the center of mass
of the ﬁrst two. Thus their sum deﬁnes the total inplane angular momentum. Hence,
for example, when λ = 0 we can have all pairs l1 and l2 with l1 =
l2. If l1 = l2 = 0,
this then provides a single eigenvalue for each choice of N = 2 l, l = 0, 1, 2, . . . .

−

Another indicator is wether n is even or odd, which is very signiﬁcant in the drawing
up of the lists, associated with the symmetries of the harmonics. Proceeding, then, we
compare values of the eﬀective potential, deﬁned by

(24)

where we subtract from each eigenvalue the value of the centrifugal term that would
correspond to it, if the binary potential were allowed to go to zero. These have been
extensively tabulated by Zhen[5].

Table 1 compares the results in the simplest case, N = 0, where we demonstrate
the convergence of the trucated matrix method with the result obtained directly, for a
sample value of ρ = 5 and Λ∗ = 10. (Λ∗ = (h2/mV0σ2)1/2)

the eﬀective potential, obtained from eigenvalues of the truncated matrix, are chosen

Asymptotic Behaviour

The matching of logarithmic derivatives provides a means of obtaining information
about the asymptotic behaviour of the eigenvalues, and hence the eﬀective potentials,
as the hyper-radius, ρ, gets large. There is however a particular diﬃculty in ﬁnding
this behaviour. It is that it is not simply a case of looking at the limiting behaviour of
2F1(a, b; c; ǫ) and 2F1(a, b; c; 1
0, because the expressions corresponding to
a and b both depend on ρ.

Thus, the conclusions previously obtained by assuming this form of asymptotic be-

Conclusion

It is now clear that the extensive numerical calculations of Zhen [5], using the truncated
matrix approach, provided good estimates of the eigenvalues, the eﬀective potentials,
and the 2 + 1 phase shifts of the third cluster. The results are consistent for the entire
range of values of ρ, taking into consideration the requirement for larger Nmax at larger
values of ρ.

We were also able to demonstrate the all important logarithmic behaviour in the
asymptotic form of some of the eﬀective potentials. This insures that the corresponding
phase shifts (dominant at low energies) go to zero, as the wave number goes to zero.
For the other 2 + 1 phase shifts, characterized by other group classiﬁcations of the
harmonics, we can demonstrate by explicit calculations that both the asymptotic form
of the eﬀective potentials and the phase shifts go to zero in a stronger manner.

We would love to obtain similar asymptotic expressions for the eﬀective potentials
of the fully interacting problem. If we were able to do this, it would simplify enormously
the cluster calculations, as well as increase its accuracy.

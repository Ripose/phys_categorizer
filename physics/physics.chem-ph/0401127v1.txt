We present a general expression for the association rate for partially diﬀusion-controlled reactions
between spherical molecules with an asymmetric reactive patch on each surface. Reaction can occur
only if the two patches are in contact and properly aligned to within speciﬁed angular tolerances.
This extends and generalizes previous approaches that considered only axially symmetric patches;
the earlier solutions are shown to be limiting cases of our general expression. Previous numeri-
cal results on the rate of protein–protein association with high steric speciﬁcity are in very good
agreement with the value computed from our analytic expression. Using the new expression, we
investigate the inﬂuence of orientational constraints on the rate constant. We ﬁnd that for angular
constraints of ∼ 5o–15o, a typical range for example in the case of protein–protein interactions, the
reaction rate is about 2 to 3 orders of magnitude higher than expected from a simple geometric
model.

INTRODUCTION

The association of two macromolecules, in particular
the formation of protein–protein complexes, is an ubiq-
uitous process in biology.
In the simplest case of the
associating species being modeled as uniformly reactive
spheres, the diﬀusion-controlled association rate is given
by the classic Smoluchowski result [1], kDC = 4πDR,
where D is the relative translational diﬀusion constant
and R denotes the sum of the radii of the molecules.
Typically, however, successful complex formation hinges
on the proper relative orientation of the reactants, which
can be represented by molecules carrying reactive surface
patches that have to come into contact with high steric
speciﬁcity for the reaction to occur.

The simple approach of multiplying the Smoluchowski
rate constant for uniformly reactive molecules by the
probability that in a random encounter the two molecules
are properly oriented (“geometric rate”) yields rate con-
stants that are commonly several orders of magnitude
lower than the observed values. Some authors attributed
this puzzling behavior to the presence of long-range at-
tractive interactions between the molecules that not only
generally speed up the rate of encounter of the molecules
but also help “guide” the molecules into conﬁgurations
close to the proper mutual orientation.

In addition to this approach, various attempts have
been made to quantitatively elucidate the inﬂuence of
orientational constraints and rotational diﬀusion on the
association rate constant. Among the earliest studies,
ˇSolc and Stockmayer derived a formal solution [2] of the
association rate constant of spherical molecules with ax-
ially symmetric distributions of reactivity and presented
numerical results [3] for the simpliﬁed case of one of
the molecules being uniformly reactive. Schmitz and
Schurr [4]
investigated both analytically and numeri-
cally the problem of the reaction between mobile ori-
entable spheres, carrying single, axially symmetric reac-
tive patches on their surface, with localized hemispheri-
cal sites on a plane. Shoup et al. [5] introduced a gen-
erally applicably approximative treatment that allowed
simpliﬁcation of the complex formal solutions of ˇSolc and
Stockmayer [3] and Schmitz and Schurr [4] to closed an-
alytical expressions; this approximation was also used
by Zhou [6] in deriving an expression for the association
rate when each molecule bears an axially symmetric re-
active patch. All these approaches showed that, because
of relative angular reorientations caused by translational
and rotational diﬀusion, the reduction in association rate
brought about by orientational constraints is signiﬁcantly
less than suggested by the reduction in the probability for
a properly oriented encounter.

The previous analytical treatments, however, impose
only (at most) axially symmetric orientational con-
straints, whereas no analytical treatment has been pre-
sented thus far for the general case of asymmetric reactive
patches (as in the important case of sterically highly spe-
ciﬁc protein–protein interactions), where the precise rela-
tive orientation of the binding partners has to be speciﬁed
and appropriately constrained.

The only numerical estimates for the association rate
constant for this general case stem from Brownian
Dynamics simulations, as for example performed by
Northrup and Erickson [9], who consider diﬀusional as-
sociation of spherical molecules, each bearing a reactive
patch composed of four contact points in a square ar-
rangement on a plane tangential to the surface of the
molecules; reaction is then assumed to occur if three of
the four contact points are correctly matched and within
a speciﬁed maximum distance. The rate constants are
again found to be about 2 orders of magnitude higher
than expected from a simple geometric argument, but as
the approach is not analytical, the result is not readily
generalizable.

In the following, we present a general expression for
the partially diﬀusion-controlled rate constant kDC for
two spherical molecules with fully asymmetric binding
patches. The theoretical derivation is given in Sec. II.
Various aspects of our general expression are investi-
gated in Sec. III, where we demonstrate that previous
approaches are, as expected, limiting cases of our general
treatment (Sec. III A), discuss the dependence of the rate
constant on orientational constraints (Section III B), and
compare numerical values obtained from our expression
with the result of a Brownian Dynamics simulation by
Northrup and Erickson [9] (Sec. III C).

II. THEORY

A. Model and coordinate system

Our model for bimolecular association (see Fig. 1) con-
sists of two spherical molecules with radii R1 and R2,
respectively, whose relative distance and angular orien-
tation change by translational and rotational diﬀusion
with diﬀusion constants D = Dtrans
and
Drot
2 . The center of sphere 1 coincides with the origin of
a ﬁxed-space coordinate system {x, y, z}. The position of
the center of sphere 2 is speciﬁed by the center-to-center
vector r whose spherical coordinates with respect to the
ﬁxed-space coordinate system are given by (r, θ, φ).

Each sphere carries a body-ﬁxed coordinate system,
denoted by {x1, y1, z1} and {x2, y2, z2}, respectively, with
the axes z1 and z2 pointing along r when the two spheres
are perfectly aligned (and hence z1 and z2 can be thought
of pointing at the “center” of the reactive patch). The
orientation of these body-ﬁxed coordinate systems with
respect to the ﬁxed-space coordinate system {x, y, z} is
parametrized by sets of Euler angles Ψ1 = (φ1, θ1, χ1)
and Ψ2 = (φ2, θ2, χ2). The angles φi and θi, i = 1, 2, are
the usual azimuthal and polar coordinates of the zi axis,
whereas χi measures the angle from the line of nodes, de-
ﬁned to be the intersection of the xy and the xiyi planes,
to the yi axis. The set (r, θ, φ, Ψ1, Ψ2) comprises the ab-
solute coordinates of the system.

For a convenient formulation of the reaction condi-
tion, we additionally introduce a relative coordinate sys-

tem {xrel, yrel, zrel}. The zrel axis coincides with the
center-to-center vector r, whereas the xrel axis lies in the
plane spanned by r and the z axis of the ﬁxed-space
coordinate system {x, y, z}. The Euler angles ΨA =
(φA, θA, χA) and ΨB = (φB, θB, χB) specify the orien-
tation of the body-ﬁxed coordinate systems {x1, y1, z1}
and {x2, y2, z2} with respect to the coordinate system
{xrel, yrel, zrel}.

B. Reaction condition

To fully specify the position and orientation of two
rigid bodies, nine variables are required, for instance,
as introduced through our absolute coordinate system,
(r, θ, φ, Ψ1, Ψ2). However, for the expression of our re-
action condition, only ﬁve variables, describing the dis-
tance between the two spheres and their relative orienta-
tion, are needed (see Fig. 2). First, the center-to-center
distance is parametrized by r. The diﬀerences in the
orientation of the two spheres can be fully captured by
the diﬀerences in the Euler angles ΨA = (φA, θA, χA)
and ΨB = (φB, θB, χB), namely, δθ = |θA − θB|, δφ =
|φA − φB|, and δχ = |χA − χB|. Finally, we need a
measure for the extent to which the reactive patches on
the spheres are aligned with the center-to-center vector
r, which can be represented by the sum of the polar an-
gles θA + θB. To facilitate the subsequent calculations,
we replace the conditions on |θA − θB| and θA + θB with

FIG. 2: The axes and angles relevant to the reaction condi-
tion, Eqs. (1). The angles θA and θB measure how close the
center of each reactive patch (coninciding with the body-ﬁxed
axes z1 and z2, respectively) is to the center-to-center vector
r. The angles δφ and δχ denote relative torsion angles of the
two body-ﬁxed coordinate systems (x1, y1, z1) and (x2, y2, z2).
To facilitate the visualization of these two angles, the origin
of the x1 and y1 axes (belonging to the coordinate system of
sphere 1) has been shifted such as to coincide with the origin
of the coordinate system of sphere 2. Our reaction condition,
Eqs. (1), requires near-optimal alignment, i.e., all angles θA,
θB, δφ, and δχ must be below given limits.

C. Derivation of the rate constant expression

To derive an expression for the association rate con-
stant, we determine the concentration c(r, θ, φ, Ψ1, Ψ2)
of spheres 2 as solution of the steady-state translational–
rotational diﬀusion equation in the absolute coordi-
nate system {r, θ, φ, Ψ1, Ψ2} introduced in the preceding

is the Laplace operator acting on the center-to-center vec-
tor r, expressed in the spherical coordinates (r, θ, φ), and
the δsi, s = x, y, z and i = 1, 2, denote an inﬁnitesimal
rotation of sphere i about its body-ﬁxed si axis. Equa-
tion (2) can be viewed as composed of three individual
diﬀusional contributions, namely, the diﬀusional motion
of the center of mass of sphere 2 relative to sphere 1 and
the rotational diﬀusion of each sphere.

As in quantum mechanics, we can deﬁne angular mo-
mentum operators ˆJsi = −i~∂/∂δsi as generators of in-
ﬁnitesimal rotations of the spheres about their body-ﬁxed
axes, and can hence rewrite Eq. (2) as

2. Uniform reactivity

If we assume that one sphere is uniformly reactive and
the other has an axially symmetric patch (that is, δφ0 =

B. Numerical evaluation

In the following, we shall assume the reaction to be
fully diﬀusion-controlled (κ → ∞), and take the radii of
the two spheres to be identical, R1 = R2. Instead of plot-
ting the absolute value of the association rate constant
kDC, we introduce the dimensionless relative association
rate constant k∗
DC = kDC/4πDR, which is the ratio of
the orientation-constrained rate constant to the Smolu-
chowski rate constant for two uniformly reactive spheres.
The full dependence of the relative association rate
constant on θ0
B, δφ0, and δχ0 is not easy to display
in a single plot. For simplicity, we set all four param-
eters equal, and in Fig. 3 plot the relative association
rate constant k∗
DC computed from Eq. (20) as a func-
tion of a single parameter (referred to Φ0 in the follow-
ing). For comparison, we also show the relative asso-
ciation rate expected from a purely probabilistic argu-
ment (geometric rate), given by the fraction of angular
orientational space over which the reaction can occur,
a0/(4π × 8π2 × 8π2) = Φ0(1 − cos Φ0)2/4π2.

A, θ0

It is evident from Fig. 3 that the diﬀerence between the
rate constant k∗
DC and the geometric rate gets more strik-
ing as the angular constraint Φ0 becomes more stringent.
For instance, in the important case of sterically highly
speciﬁc protein–protein interactions where Φ0 will typ-
ically range between 5o and 15o, the geometric rate is
about 2 to 3 orders of magnitude too low, as compared
with the association rate computed from Eq. (20).

C. Comparison against Brownian dynamics
simulations

In the Brownian dynamics simulations by Northrup
and Erickson [9], protein molecules are modeled as hard
spheres of R = 18 ˚A diﬀusing in water (η ≃ 8.9 ×
10−4 Ns/m2) at T = 298 K; no forces are assumed to
act between the molecules. The translational and rota-
tional diﬀusion constants are computed from the Stokes–
Einstein relations Dtrans = kBT /6πηR and Drot =
kBT /8πηR3, respectively.

Instead of angular constraints, the model uses a
contact-based reaction condition. A set of four distinctly
numbered contact points is mounted on each sphere in
a 17 ˚A × 17 ˚A square arrangement on a plane tangen-
tial to the surface of the sphere. Reaction is assumed
to occur when at least three of the four contact points
are correctly matched and within a maximum distance of
2 ˚A.

angles θ0
B, δφ0, and δχ0 (as deﬁned in our model,
see Sec. II) that correspond to this contact-based reac-
tion condition. Clearly, there will be a multiplicity of
sets of these angles for which the contact-based reaction
criterion is met. To reduce the search space in a reason-
able way, we looked for geometric conﬁgurations where
all four angles were equal, θ0
B = δφ0 = δχ0, and
found that the contact-based reaction condition can be
well represented by an angular constraint of θ0
B =
δφ0 = δχ0 = 6.7o.

A = θ0

A = θ0

With these angular constraints, numerical evaluation
of Eq. (20) with the parameters speciﬁed above and
κ → ∞ gives kDC = 1.04 × 105 M−1 s−1, which is in very
good agreement with the value obtained from the Brow-
nian dynamics simulation by Northrup and Erickson [9],
kDC = 1 × 105 M−1 s−1.

IV. SUMMARY

We have presented a general expression for the
diﬀusion-controlled association rate of two molecules
where reaction can occur solely if speciﬁed constraints on
the mutual orientation are fulﬁlled. Our solution goes far
beyond previous treatments in the ability to impose very
general, asymmetric orientational constraints, as needed
for instance in a proper description of the sterically highly
speciﬁc association of two proteins.

Since our expression for the rate constant, Eq. (20),
was derived under the assumption of no forces acting
between the two molecules, a comparison of measured
association rates with their theoretical values calculated
from Eq. (20) should reveal the extent to which long-
range interactions contribute to the rate of intermolecular
association. Such an investigation would be of particular
interest in the case of the association of proteins with
small ligands and other proteins.

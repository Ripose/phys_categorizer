Abstract

We study a dynamical model of a rod-like particle surrounded by a cloud of smaller particles

of the same charge and we show that, in the presence of a low-frequency alternating electric ﬁeld,

the rod displays the same type of anomalous orientation (perpendicular to the ﬁeld) that was

recently observed in laboratory colloids. This indicates that the anomalous orientation is due to

the collective dynamics of the colloidal particles, and does not require electro-osmotic eﬀects. We

also conﬁrm the experimental observation that for higher ﬁeld frequencies the standard orientation

(parallel to the ﬁeld) prevails. In the simulations, these changes are abrupt enough to resemble a

phase transition.

An important feature of many colloidal particles is that they are electrically charged,

due to surface eﬀects involving their interaction with the solvent or with an electrolyte

[1, 2]. The long-range nature of electrostatic interactions generates interesting collective

or “electrokinetic” eﬀects that resemble in many ways the complex phenomena that are

familiar in plasma physics. In particular, colloidal dynamics can be very sensitive to applied

external electric ﬁelds. For example, it is known [3, 4] that at high concentrations rodlike

colloids display ﬁeld-induced anomalous (negative) optical birefringence. This implies that

the rods align perpendicular to the external ﬁeld, whereas at lower densities they assume

the more intuitive alignment parallel to it. This phenomenon of anomalous orientation has

been the object of some theoretical studies [4, 5, 6], but remains basically unexplained. Its

importance has been recently underscored by some new experimental work [7], which studied

how dilute suspensions of charged rod-like colloids (“primary particles,” or PP) respond to a

low external electric ﬁeld in the presence of smaller spherical charged particles (“secondary

particles,” or SP). Once again, the ﬁeld-induced orientation of the rod-like colloids was

investigated by measuring the optical birefringence of the solution and extracting the Kerr

constant as a function of the frequency of the ﬁeld. The key result was that, when the SP are

present, even in dilute solutions the PP align perpendicular to the ﬁeld as long as the forcing

frequency is lower that a certain threshold. This is a surprising result, especially because

this “anomalous” orientation seems to be universal [7] in mixtures of this type, suggesting

that there is a general physical mechanism in need of theoretical explanation.

Here we make the case that this phenomenon does reﬂect a basic and universal dy-

namical eﬀect, by showing how the anomalous orientation arises already in a very simple

two-dimensional model, in which a single one-dimensional rod with charges at both ends

interacts with a cloud of point charges. All the charges in question are taken to have the

same sign; the whole system is driven by an alternating electric ﬁeld and is placed in a box

with periodic boundary conditions. Obviously, such a simpliﬁed model cannot be expected

to yield quantitatively accurate predictions of the behavior of laboratory colloids. On the

other hand, it is precisely the simplicity of the model that makes it signiﬁcant that we obtain

the anomalous orientation that has been observed experimentally [7]. This suggests that the

eﬀect under consideration is quite fundamental and independent of the detailed structure of

the colloids. In fact, the sophisticated electro-osmotic phenomena [8] that take place around

real colloids are completely absent from our model. Hence, these eﬀects are shown not to

2

play an essential role in changing the orientation, since the collective dynamics alone of the

rod and the particles are able to do it. Our simulations suggest the following scenario: due

to the relative motion induced by the ﬁeld, when the bar is not perpendicular to the ﬁeld

the charges at its two ends compress and decompress asymmetrically the cloud of SP. Such

asymmetry in the density of the SP generates a collective torque that tends to push the bar

toward the perpendicular alignment until the symmetry is restored. This mechanism, how-

ever, is eﬀective only if the frequency of the ﬁeld is low enough, because if the bar oscillates

too quickly the SP cannot organize collectively in a torque-producing conﬁguration, and

the system enters a regime in which the bar adopts the more familiar orientation along the

ﬁeld. Interestingly, the transition from the ”anomalous” to the ”regular” orientation is quite

abrupt, so much so that it is reminiscent of a ﬁrst-order phase transition. The orientation is

fairly independent of the polarizability of the bar and the amplitude of the ﬁeld. However,

the aspect ratio of the container appears to be important.

DYNAMICAL MODEL

We introduce a two-dimensional molecular-dynamics-type model of a colloidal suspension

containing a rod-like colloid and multiple (identical) point particles. The Hamiltonian for

where (X, P ) are the canonical coordinates of the center of mass of the bar, (xi, pi) are the

coordinates of the i-th secondary particle for i = 1, . . . , n and θ is the angle between the bar

and the x-axis; R1 ≡ X + Lν and R2 ≡ X − Lν with ν ≡ (cos θ, sin θ) are the positions of

the ends of the bar, which has length 2L; j is the unit vector in the direction of the external

ﬁeld. The mass and charge of each SP are m and q; the bar carries two masses M/2 and

two charges Q1, Q2 concentrated at each end. F , Ω are the amplitude and frequency of the

forcing ﬁeld.

We introduce dimensionless variables by measuring space, time, masses and charges in

units of L, Ω−1, m and q, respectively. The equations of motion become

Clearly, α is the ratio squared of the period of oscillation of the ﬁeld divided by the time

scale over which the electrostatic repulsion between two SP’s is able to move them across

the length of the bar. Hence, α measures the coupling between secondary particles. As for

f , it is the ratio squared of the period of oscillation of the ﬁeld divided by the time scale

over which the ﬁeld itself moves a SP across the length of the bar; thus f is a dimensionless

measure of the ﬁeld strength. Without loss of generality, we choose m = q = L = 1, so that
α = Ω−2, f = F Ω−2.

One can add some simple enhancements to this model that make it somewhat more

realistic. First of all, we will take into account the eﬀects of polarization by replacing the
ﬁxed charges ˜Qk, k = 1, 2, in Eqs. (2) with the functions

˜Qk(θ, t) = Q

1 + (−1)kǫ(θ)F cos t

(cid:2)

(cid:3)

where 0 ≤ ǫ(θ) ≤ 1 is an angle-dependent polarizability coeﬃcient. Also, we will add to
the right-hand sides of Eqs. (2) three Langevin terms −γ1 ˙X, −γ2 ˙xi and −γ3 ˙θ in order

to have a crude model of the frictional eﬀects of the solvent. One could also simulate the

screening eﬀect of an electrolyte by replacing the Coulomb potential with a Yukawa potential

4

φ(r) = e−κr/r where κ is the inverse Debye length [1]. Here, however, we will consider

exclusively the Coulomb case κ = 0 (no electrolyte), modiﬁed only by a short-range cut-oﬀ

for both physical reasons and numerical convenience.

In practice, the life-span of numerical solutions to Eqs. (2) is seriously limited by the fact

that the SP’s impart a slow (for N ≫ 1) net drift to the center of mass of the bar. When

the bar hits the box’s wall, calculations with periodic boundary conditions get disrupted

because the bar gets “broken,” and one endpoint moved to the opposite side of the box.

Reﬂecting boundary conditions, on the other hand, interfere heavily with the rotation of

the bar and make it hard to observe the inﬂuence of the SP’s and of the external ﬁeld. For

the sake of simplicity, it is convenient to assume that the motion of X is determined only

by the ﬁeld and not by the SP’s; this allows us to focus on the crucial coupling between

the rotational degree of freedom of the bar and the secondary particles. If we drop the ﬁrst

term on the right-hand side in the equation for X(t), we can choose the solution

where (X0, Y0) is the center of the box, substitute it into the other equations in (2) and solve

them numerically.

NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS

The equations we just introduced were solved numerically for n = 50 SP’s in a box with

periodic boundary conditions. Typical parameters that roughly reﬂect the physical charge

and mass ratios are obtained by choosing Q = N = 10. Since our numerical experiments

show that the preferred orientation of the bar is not very sensitive to changes in either the

frictional eﬀects or the polarizability of the bar itself, we also ﬁx γ1 = γ2 = γ3 = 0.05 and

set ǫ(θ) ≡ 0.2 (neglecting the angular dependence of the polarizability). Thus, we are left

with the two parameters α and f – or, equivalently, Ω and F .

The overall dependence of the bar’s orientation on Ω and F is shown in Fig. (1a). We

characterize the orientation via the reference angle θr (the angle θ mapped onto the ﬁrst

quadrant), which is intuitively more transparent than he usual P2(θ) Legendre polynomial;

the horizontal position is π/4 (P2 = 0.25), which is the same value that one would get if the

orientation of the bar were just a uniformly distributed random variable. Interestingly, the

parameter plane is divided in three well-deﬁned regions, with fairly sharp boundaries, where

each one of these three behaviors (regular, anomalous and random orientation) is prevalent.

For ln F . 0 the choice of orientation is essentially independent of F and depends only on

Ω. At higher frequencies the bar aligns with the external ﬁeld, but if ln Ω . 4 the preferred

orientation changes to orthogonal to the ﬁeld. At even lower frequencies, however, the

external ﬁeld is not able to orient the bar at all and the angle appears to change randomly.

Note that increasing the frequency further (ln Ω & 6) results in the bar moving away from a

clear vertical orientation (orange region). Dynamically speaking, this is the high-frequency

regime where the ﬁeld polarity changes too rapidly and the bar is minimally aﬀected by

both the ﬁeld and the SP’s. In this regime, as clearly seen from Fig. (1b), the bar remains

ﬁxed at the initial orientation. Finally, for ln F & 1 only the “regular”and ”random” cases

arise. We also tested that in the absence of any SP one gets only the vertical orientation

(red), as expected.

In order to gain some insight into the particle dynamics associated with the regular and

the anomalous orientation, in Fig. (2) we consider two representative cases and show the

time-evolution of θ (in units of π) over 20 cycles of the ﬁeld. In each case, the parameters

considered lie deep in the respective phases in F -Ω space and the dynamics quickly settle

the bar into the appropriate alignment. The diﬀerence in the distribution of the SP in the

two cases is striking. In the regular (vertical orientation) case the particles are essentially

conﬁned to the regions along the perimeter of the cell, and especially in the corners. This is in

contrast to the anomalous case where the particles inhabit a much larger fraction of the box

and are only excluded from two narrow regions immediately surrounding the (large) charges

on the bar. Thus, in the high-frequency case the rapid motion of the bar has a cavitating

eﬀect, which leads the SP to generate a very ﬂat-bottomed eﬀective potential well; hence,

the orientation of the bar is principally determined by the external ﬁeld as if in a vacuum.

By contrast, in the low-frequency case the cloud of SP ﬁlls a larger space, contracting and

expanding in synchrony with the bar’s oscillations. As a result, the vertical gradient in the

cloud’s density produces a net torque on the bar, and the energetically favored conﬁguration

is the one in which the PP is kept horizontal by the SP’s eﬀective potential, which prevails

on the external potential in orienting of the rod. The fact that the SP are clustered closer

to the bar for anomalous orientation provides insight into the relative energetics of the two

conﬁgurations. The decreased mean spacing between each of the SP and the bar means that

this conﬁguration is a more energetic and, in a dynamical sense, unstable one. Finally, in

the random phase neither the external ﬁeld nor the pressure of the cloud is dominant. It

is possible that this regime is governed by single SP proximity events rather than collective

behavior.

The simulations shown so far have been for a rectangular (3 : 5) box, so one wonders how

the phase diagram in F -Ω changes when the aspect ratio is square (4 : 4). As seen from

Fig. (3), the anomalous phase vanishes, while the phase boundaries are still visible. This sug-

8

gests that the distribution of SP no longer generates adequate screening for the anomalous

orientation to be attained. The question of why the rectangular case should be reﬂective of

what happens in the experiments is obviously beyond the scope of our simpliﬁed single-bar

model. We speculate that, in laboratory systems, the interactions among multiple PP in

solution favor a mutual alignment of the bars in a lattice structure with spacing consistent

with a rectangular cell. We further speculate that such a putative statistical bias towards

”staggering” of the bars may depend only weakly on the concentration of the PP; in fact,

the experiments [7] show that PP concentration does not aﬀect the anomalous orientation

signiﬁcantly. These conjectures will be the object of future investigations. Finally, as sug-

gested earlier, the sharp boundaries between the orientation regions in F -Ω space suggest a

three-phase diagram akin to what has been seen, for example, in disordered spin systems [9].

There are two distinct ordered phases, corresponding to the normal and anomalous orien-

tation of the rod-like colloid, and a disordered or “glassy” phase corresponding to random

orientation. Our dynamical model makes clear the competing inﬂuences (frustration) inher-

ent in the system, and this analogy may prove useful in explaining features like re-entrancy

visible in the phase diagrams.

A problem of inducing a required sign of chirality in a racemic mixture of enantiomers of a
chiral molecule is analyzed. As an example, a racemic mixture (vapor) of left- and right-handed
enantiomers of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) molecule is considered.
It is shown that biharmonic
Raman excitation of the splitted due to the left-right conversion internal rotation levels can be
eﬀectively used for inducing optical activity in the initially racemic vapor of H2O2 molecules. An
experiment to study this photoinduced optical rotation is discussed.

I. INTRODUCTION

Chiral speciﬁcity of the bioorganic world is one of the most intriguing phenomenon of Nature [1–4]. It is often
thought to reﬂect mirror breaking responsible for a life with a given ‘sign of chirality’, in the absence of any evidence
of ‘mirror-antipode’ life [5–8]. Physical origins of this symmetry breaking are not completely understood yet. Along
with spontaneous symmetry breaking studies, understanding that optical methods, speciﬁcally methods of nonlinear
optics [9], could be used not just to monitor, but also to control chiral symmetry of molecules seems to be of great
importance.

In this paper we investigate a possibility of excitation of the chiral-asymmetric states of the hydrogen peroxide
molecule (H2O2) driven by a laser pulse parameters of which (duration and laser ﬁeld intensity) ﬁt special requirements
discussed in the paper. Hydrogen peroxide molecule (Fig. 1a) is a simplest chiral molecule geometry of which is non-
invariant with respect to the coordinate inversion transformation (X, Y, Z)

(X, Y,

Z).

When this transformation is applied the mirror-image of the molecule cannot be mapped with the original with the
help of any rotation transformation because the torsional angles of the molecule
θ2) are not equivalent.
When we select between left- or right-handed frame, a choice of the direction of the vector nO from one atom to
another allows us then to assign a deﬁnite sign to the torsional angle ∠HOOH. An equilibrium value of the torsional
120◦ [10–13], where
angle in the gas phase in accordance with theoretical calculations and experimental data is θ
positive sign corresponds to the shown in Fig. 1a so-called d-state (right-handed enantiomer) and negative—to the
l-state (left-handed enantiomer).

A rough understanding of the eﬀect of photoinduced switching between left- and right-handed enantiomers of
H2O2 molecule may be obtained as follows. This molecule has a characteristic double well torsional potential shape.
Existence of the mirror symmetry of the minima of the torsional potential leads to the splitting of energy states as a
result of tunneling through the lower barrier. The resulting eigen states being presented with the even and odd wave
functions ψS, ψA (tunneling through the higher barrier and the corresponding additional splitting are negligible [13]).
Relatively large splitting value ∆E0 = 11.4 cm−1 corresponds to the absence of stationary chiral-asymmetric states,
which actually oscillate with the frequency ω0 = E0/~ between the stationary states ψS, ψA until the symmetric
equilibrium is reached. As a result, one can manipulate the chiral properties of H2O2 molecule inducing tunneling
between d- and l-enantiomers and therefore the eﬀect of photoinduced optical rotation has an oscillating character.
By contrast, for the case of heavier molecules tunneling time between diﬀerent enantiomers of which may be inﬁnitely
large and initially produced chiral asymmetric state is stable.
The Hamiltonian of molecule–laser ﬁeld interaction ˆHI =

dkE(rk) displays a qualitative diﬀerence in dipole
E(r0)) proton contributions are
(HD) and quadrupole (HQ) approximations. In dipole approximation (at E(rk)
E(r0)) they are substracted. As a result, HD

In this paper we discuss the conditions under which the eﬀect of photo-induced chirality can be studied experimen-
tally by registering the corresponding photoinduced optical activity in a racemic mixture of left- and right-handed
enantiomers of the H2O2 molecule, which shows no optical activity otherwise.

A rough estimate of the order of magnitude of the discussed eﬀect can be made within the model of one-photon
excitation. The criterion of alignment of the molecules dipole moments along Z axis for 100% of the molecules in a
solution under the action of dc electric ﬁeld with the magnitude E can be written as EeaH
kT (aH is the O–H bond
106 V/cm. If we do not require that 100%
length, e is the proton charge), which at the room temperature gives E
of the molecules in the solution are to be aligned, we can then use relatively moderate ﬁeld intensities and therefore
achieve a smaller degree of alignment κ = EeaH/kT , which however may be enough to determine experimentally
optical activity in the initially racemic solution.

In the frequency region of electronic susceptibility, the eﬀect can be estimated to the lowest order under the
suggestion that κ represents the part of molecules aligned strictly along the ﬁeld, whereas the rest of the molecules
do not contribute to the eﬀect. Then the upper estimate can be obtained by multiplying the typical speciﬁc rotation
dm for the media with strong optical activity by the small parameter κ, which gives us

using dc electric ﬁeld for aligning the molecules.

II. H2O2 MOLECULE’S DYNAMICS IN ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELD

2

A. Reduced model of free molecule’s dynamics

To describe free molecule’s dynamics driven by the laser ﬁeld we shall start with the mathematical description of
free molecule’s dynamics. For this it seems helpful to reduce the total molecular Hamiltonian using the fact that
proton to oxygen mass ratio is a small one. Then the protons’ dynamics can be treated adiabatically with respect
to the oxygen coordinates so that the dynamics of oxygen nuclei can be calculated by averaging over direction of the
unit vector nO = (sin ϑ cos ϕ, sin ϑ sin ϕ, cos ϑ) along the O–O bond. Averaging along Z-coordinate (Fig. 1a) should
be performed then only for protons rotation about the O–O bond, which potential depends only on the torsion angle
θ = θ2

θ1.

Under these conditions, the molecular Hamiltonian in a reduced model, which includes both the free molecule’s

−

rotation about the O–O bond and torsional oscillations, takes the form:

where ˜θ = (θ1 + θ2)/2, mH is the proton mass and V (θ) is the torsional potential. For simplicity, we neglect the
vibrations of the valence angles ∠HOO.

Initial molecule’s position, which can be referred to as the mean angle ˜θ, includes, in addition to the above mentioned
uncertainty in direction nO, an uncertainty due to the molecule’s rotation about this direction, which corresponds to
the third rotational degree of freedom plus to the two angles that determine the direction of nO. Corresponding to
(n + 1/2) cm−1 calculated from (3), (4)
the free rotation about O–O bond transition frequencies ωn→n+1 = 7.84
are four times smaller than the corresponding frequencies of internal rotation, which are determined by the torsional
potential V (θ).

B. Photoexcitation of molecule’s rotational degrees of freedom

In this section we will discuss a model of molecule–laser ﬁeld interaction with an accent placed on the photoexcitation
of molecule’s rotational degrees of freedom. Let us consider H2O2 molecule interacting with the laser ﬁeld E(t) =
E1u1(t) cos(ω1t + ϕ1) with the pulse envelope u1(t) and frequency ω1
ωn→n+1, so that we can neglect the quantum
speciﬁcity of the excitation. The following classical equation governs then the rotational dynamics of the molecule:

≫

where J is the molecule’s moment of inertia.

In zero’th order with respect to the angle deviation for the acting force in the right side of the equation and in the

case of not too short laser pulses (τ1

1/ω1) the angle response ∆˜θ at the frequency ω1 takes the form:

This angle deviation causes the modulation of the quadrupole Hamiltonian at the frequency ω1, which in its turn causes
the internal rotation of the molecule and therefore leads to the partial aligning of the molecule. The latter reveals
In particular, in case the O–O bond directs
in modiﬁcation of the quadrupole Hamiltonian rotational symmetry.
along Z axis, i.e. ϑ = 0, and the laser ﬁeld E1 shines along Y axis, the rotational symmetry leads to a homogeneous
distribution versus angle ˜θ, dependence on which in the quadrupole moment is given by sin ˜θ. Molecule’s orientation
reveals then in the angle response, which can be extracted from Eq. (5) in the form

where I1 is the E1 ﬁeld intensity in W/cm2 and the angle is given in radians. This estimate goes to 1 only for the
ﬁeld strengths larger than atomic ones.

Torsional oscillations dynamics describing by the Hamiltonian ˆHθ is essentially quantum one due to the relatively
small proton to oxygen mass ratio. This leads to the tunneling between the d and l local minima of the torsional
potential (Fig. 1b) and therefore to two energy-splitted superposition eigen states ψS, ψA with equally represented
d- and l-conﬁgurations.
In addition, it determines the non-rigidity of molecule’s geometry due to the quantum
uncertainty of the wave functions versus torsional angle. Torsional potential of H2O2 molecule and its eigen energies
have been extensively explored by ab initio calculations and respective ﬁtting to the experimental spectra. The
torsional potential and corresponding energy levels structure taken for our calculations from [13] are shown in Fig.
1b. With this potential, an estimate for the local states uncertainty on torsional angle, which is based on expression
for the ﬂuctuations in vacuum state of a harmonic oscillator, gives σθ ≈

where e1,2 are the corresponding unit direction vectors of the protons bonds, e is the laser ﬁeld polarization vector

center of frame. Its displacement causes an additional contribution to the dipole Hamiltonian, which is however small
and can be neglected as it displays the same qualitative interaction properties as the main term. In our calculations we
therefore choose the center of frame as it is shown in Fig. 1a in order to simplify the Hamiltonian. The corresponding

When non-zero value δH is taken into account, analytical expressions for the above listed coeﬃcients derived with
the use of computer algebra are bulky, so that we list them here for a speciﬁc case of δH = 0, i.e., for the case when
the proton bonds are orthogonal to the bond O–O. The corresponding error is then not larger than
10% due to the
small value of δH ≈

For the simpliﬁed analysis of both molecule’s rotation about axis O–O and torsional oscillations, the numerical
values of the torsional potential V (θ) are essential. The corresponding numbers for the energy splitting, which we
adopted from [13], are as follows: ∆E0 = 11.44 cm−1, ∆E1 = 116.34 cm−1, ∆E2 = 206.57 cm−1. For n
1 they
exceed the frequencies of free molecule rotation. Therefore, the transitions between the eigen states of the torsional
Hamiltonian ˆHθ can be described in terms of classical coordinate ˜θ.

III. PHOTOINDUCED INTERNAL ROTATION IN H2O2 MOLECULE

This section presents a discussion on photoinduced excitation of internal conversion in H2O2 between left- and

right-handed enantiomers.

Torsional potential of H2O2 molecule has a characteristic double-well shape (Fig. 1b) minima of which correspond
to the left- and right-handed enantiomers and are mirror-symmetrically spaced. As a result, the eigenstates of the
torsional Hamiltonian split due to the tunneling through the potential energy barrier separating the two wells. It
seems reasonable to assume that the splitting of the eigen states of the torsional Hamiltonian ˆHθ, or internal rotation
frequencies, signiﬁcantly exceed the rotation frequencies of a free molecule. Under this assumption, resonant laser
excitation of the internal rotation transition causes negligibly small deviations in molecule’s orientation angles ϑ, ϕ
and a small deviation of the rotation angle ˜θ. Therefore, the symmetric, ψS, and antisymmetric, ψA, states of the
torsional potential can be excited into a coherent superposition CAψA + CSψS. The transition energy between S- and
A-states, ∆En, can be estimated as

where ∆V and ∆θ are the characteristic values of the height and width of the potential barrier (Fig. 1b).

In case of resonant excitation with the frequency ω0 = ∆En/~ only resonant matrix elements in the Hamiltonians
(10) remain essential and, therefore, torsional dynamics of the molecule can be essentially reduced to that one of the
two-level system.

Let us now examine, for the case of linear polarization (eX = 1, eY = 0)1, the 2

2-matrix of the one-photon
interaction Hamiltonian ˆHL of the total one-photon interaction Hamiltonian ˆHI = ˆHD + ˆHQ, where with the help of

Here, in addition to the transformation (19), free precession with the laser ﬁeld frequency is also taken into account
(by contrast, the latter is regularly applied in the interaction representation [15] and RWA to the operators of physical
variables). In (20) the terms with ˆσ1, ˆσ2 represent the contribution of coherent superposition of the states ψS, ψA.
In particular, for the lower initial state, which corresponds to w = 1 at ωLt + ˜ϕL = π/2, excitation of the system by
1/√2 in (19b), transfers the initial
π/2-pulse, for which Φ =

This averaging can be done with the use of standard superoperator calculation technique [16]. Performing averaging
for the resulting excitation (20) of the initially incoherent state just over the sign of the parameter Q, which depends
on the angle ˜θ of the mean proton bonds orientation along axis X that is accounted in (20) by factor sin Φ, we receive
the following structure of the density matrix:

ˆρt = ( ˆI

This means that in the absence of molecules orientation over angle ˜θ the density matrix is transformed incoherently,
i.e., diagonal matrices preserve the diagonal form. Therefore, after such kind of transformation the symmetry of each
pure component S or A does not change so that the square modulus of the wave function preserves mirror symmetry
with respect to the transformation θ
θ. As a result, we can conclude that averaging over the Θ angles cancels
the eﬀect.

→ −

How can we cope with this? An answer is that to broke the mirror symmetry the molecules should be spatially
aligned during the excitation. In the section below we will examine the excitation of preliminary aligned molecules.

A. Excitation of preliminary aligned molecules

Let us assume that we were able spatially align the molecules in an ensemble. This can be done either by applying
strong dc electric ﬁeld (see Introduction) or by a laser pulse (sections 2, 4). If the molecules are spatially aligned, an
inhomogeneity in the distribution of angle ˜θ takes place and, therefore, excitation of incoherent states will contain
a coherent component corresponding to the excitation of chiral states, i.e., the ones diﬀerent from ψA and ψS. It is
desirable to be able to characterize the eﬀect of excitation by a simple characteristic. Let us determine the scalar
property of the degree of chirality as the average value

Two-photon Raman excitation (pump and probe laser beams) is used for driving the tunneling transition between left- and
right-handed enantiomers. One of the driving system laser beams (pump) is also used for partial aligning of the molecules in
the interaction region. Eﬀect of induced optical rotation manifests itself at the probe beam frequency ω2 and could be measured
experimentally using polarization analyzer in the direction of pump beam.

IV. AN EXPERIMENTAL SCHEME FOR REGISTRATION OF PHOTOINDUCED OPTICAL
ROTATION IN H2O2 VAPOR

In this section we discuss an experiment for registration of photoinduced optical rotation in a racemic vapor of

H2O2 molecules.

First, we should select an eﬀective two-level system we will work with. It seems reasonable to use for this purpose
the S–A-transition of the ﬁrst excited internal rotation level (n = 1) of the H2O2 torsional potential. Its wavelength
86 µm and ω12 = 116.34 cm−1, respectively. The latter essentially exceeds the corresponding
and frequency are λ
frequency of 11.44 cm−1 for the ground internal rotation level (n = 0).

≃

For manipulations with the working transition we should transfer into it some population. This can be done using
two-photon Raman excitation with two lasers frequency oﬀset of which is equal to the transition frequency of the
S–S-transition between ground and ﬁrst excited internal rotation levels (n = 0
n = 1). As far as only dipole
→
transitions are used in this excitation process, it seems possible to almost saturate the transition in the active volume
1 for the initial population value.
and, therefore, for further calculations we can simply use an estimate value of nS ∼
Due to the oscillating character of the eﬀect, the degree of chirality will also oscillate. Therefore, it seems most
consistent to use in experiment two laser ﬁelds (Fig. 2b). One of them, at the frequency ω1, will serve as the pump
ﬁeld, while another one with the frequency ω2 will be the probe, with the frequency diﬀerence ω1
ω2 = ω12 in
resonance with the tunneling transition. The eﬀect of photoinduced optical rotation can be registered then with the
use of two crossed polarizers, so that the registered polarization in the direction perpendicular to the probe ﬁeld
polarization manifests the eﬀect of photoinduced optical rotation in a racemic vapor.

−

In this scheme, the probe ﬁeld is used also for aligning the molecules, acting by analogy with the aligning eﬀect in
the presence of strong dc electric ﬁeld that is discussed in Sec. I. In accordance with Eq. (6) the probe ﬁeld aﬀects the
torsional angle, which thus oscillates with the probe ﬁeld frequency ω2. As a result, the quadrupole Hamiltonian of
the interaction with the pump ﬁeld with the frequency ω1 at the frequency ω2 and polarization vector directed along
X axis receives, in accordance with Eq. (15), a contribution at the resonance frequency ω12:

At this point, an additional dependence of cos(θ/2) on the torsional angle is to be included into the matrix element
(16), which is equivalent to the substitution sin(θ/2)
(sin θ)/2. The resulting matrix element is also non-zero
and additional time dependence of cos(ω1t + ϕ1) corresponds to the substitution of the incident laser frequency

where laser pulses duration τp is given in seconds and intensities I1, I2 of the pump and probe laser ﬁelds are in

the action of π/2-pulse with the pulse duration of
1 ns. The mean proportional intensity of the pump and probe
pulses is calculated then as I0 = 104/τp ∼

on the assumption that the order of magnitude of speciﬁc rotation is characterized by additional small parameter

tunneling transition. Therefore, the propagation eﬀects at this frequency are relatively small and can be neglected.

An experimental setup for the discussed above two-photon Raman excitation of the tunneling transition in the H2O2
vapor is shown in Fig. 2b. The eﬀect of photoinduced optical rotation in the racemic vapor of equally distributed
enantiomers of H2O2 molecule can be registered at each of the two frequencies ω1,2 of the pump and probe beams.
Averaging over molecules orientation reveals only in the uncertainty of the Rabi frequency, due to its angle dependence
cos2 ˜θ. This, however, does not change the eﬀect by order of magnitude in contrast to the method of electrostatic
orientation. To avoid interference of the probe ﬁeld with the frequency ω2 with the registered at the same frequency
eﬀect in the pump ﬁeld, the beams could be slightly crossed in the sample at the angle small enough not to aﬀect the
ﬁeld distribution in the active region.

V. CONCLUSIONS

In conclusion, an attempt was made to answer a question: How methods of nonlinear optics can be used to
induce a required sign of chirality in a racemic mixture of enantiomers of a chiral molecule? We consider a racemic
mixture of left- and right-handed enantiomers of hydrogen peroxide molecule. Torsional potential of this molecule
has a characteristic double-well shape minima of which correspond to the left- and right-handed enantiomers and are
mirror-symmetrically spaced. As a result, a splitting of eigenstates of the torsional Hamiltonian arises from tunneling
through the potential energy barrier separating the two wells. For H2O2 molecule this tunneling splitting is 11.4 cm-1
and 116.34 cm-1 for the internal rotation ground and ﬁrst excited states, respectively, so that the the molecule shows
rapid oscillations between left- and right-handed enantiomers. In a vapor or in a solution situation is complicated due
to the averaging over ensemble.

Analysis of molecule-electromagnetic ﬁeld interaction shows that dipole interaction does not contribute to the left-
right conversion process (this interaction we can use for orientation of dipole moments of molecules in the mixture),
but the quadrupole interaction, which leads to the excitation of coherent precession between left- and right-handed
enantiomers’ states. This gives us a tool for controlling the chiral symmetry of the molecule. We show that biharmonic
Raman excitation of the splitted internal rotation levels can be eﬀectively used for inducing optical activity in an
initially racemic mixture of left- and right-handed enantiomers of H2O2 molecules. An experiment to study this
photoinduced optical rotation in H2O2 vapor is proposed.

2This intensity is about the intensity of the photoionization threshold for H2O2 molecules and therefore we should keep in
experiment the intensities of the pump and probe beams on the level much less than this intensity. One can easily ﬁt this
condition by shortening the pulse duration (which cannot be made still much shorter than the internal conversion characteristic
time) or by increasing the sensitivity of measuring the rotation angles. For example, for the π/20-pulses, sensitivity of about
′′

−2 cm the required intensities are I0/100 ∼ 1011 W/cm2.

and interaction length of about L ∼ 10

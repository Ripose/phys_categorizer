Threshold and high-frequency behavior of dipole-bound anion
photodetachment

V. E. Chernov and Boris A. Zon∗
Voronezh State University,394693, Russia, Voronezh, University Sq.,1

An explicit analytic description is given for dipole-bound anion (DBA) as an excess electron bound
to the molecular neutral due to its dipole moment. The calculated DBA photodetachment cross-
section displays ∝ ω−2
behavior for large ω, in complete accordance with the experimental data
[Bailey et al., J. Chem. Phys 104, 6976 (1996)]. At the threshold the photodetachment cross-section
displays the Gailitis–Damburg oscillations.

PACS numbers: 33.80.Eh, 33.15.Ry

Considerable attention is payed presently to so-
called dipole-bound anions (DBA), i. e. molecular
negative ions in which the excess electron is bound
to the molecular neutral (MN) due to its dipole mo-
ment [1]. Such structures play important role in var-
ious physical, chemical and biological processes [2].
As early as in 1947 Fermi and Teller [3] in their
analysis of meson capture by hydrogen atoms noted
that a ﬁxed point dipole d > 1.625 D can bind
an electron to an inﬁnitely large number of bound
states. A number of subsequent studies taking into
account the ﬁnite dipole eﬀects [4], presence of a
short-range repulsive core potential [5], rotational
excitation [6], polarization and quadrupolar interac-
tion (see Ref. [7] and references wherein) yield the
minimum dipole moment 2–2.5 D required to form
DBAs of common molecules [1, 8].

DBAs for experimental studies are created mainly
by free electron attachment under high pressure noz-
zle expansion conditions [9, 10, 11, 12] and by charge
transfer from Rydberg atoms [8, 13]. The created
DBAs are investigated, e. g., by photoelectron spec-
troscopy [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14].

Large-scale ab initio calculations (see,

for in-
stance, [12, 15, 16, 17] and references therein) of
DBA structure studied the eﬀects of correlation, or-
bital relaxation, dispersion and charge-transfer in-
teraction. However, despite the increasing accu-
racy of such many-electron calculations, simpliﬁed
one-electron local model potentials still have been
proving their eﬃciency and suitability for large-scale
computer simulations, as well as more analytical the-
ories ([18] and references wherein).

In this Letter we use simple model which consid-
ers DBA as an electron moving in a point dipole
potential. The developed below simple analytic the-
ory allows to explain some features of frequency-
dependent DBA photodetachment. While the most
of experimental photoelectron spectra are recorded
at a constant photon frequency ω, the Reference [14]

negative ions [20], and can be easily explained using
the proposed analytical technique. Our model also
predicts oscillatory behavior of the cross-section near
the threshold. Such oscillations were predicted for

ω−7/2 in atoms [19] and

electron scattered on hydrogen atom [21] and two-
photon photodetachment of hydrogen anion with ex-
citation of the residual atom [22]. The oscillations
(as well as the linear Stark eﬀect) are due to constant
dipole moment of excited states of nonrelativistic hy-
drogen atom. Similar oscillations for electron scat-
tering on polar molecules are discussed in [23].

We consider the MN to be a symmetric top whose
rotational state is determined by its angular momen-
tum j with the projection jζ onto the molecule-ﬁxed
ζ-axis directed along the MN dipole moment d which
is considered to be a point one. We also assume that
MN remains in one of its vibrational states. The
Hamiltonian of the excess electron moving in the
ﬁeld of the rotating MN is

The solution of Schr¨odinger equation with the
Hamiltonan (1) can be found as a sum over the chan-
nels corresponding to diﬀerent MN states:

Ψ =

Rj(r)Φj ,

Xj

(2)

where the angular functions Φj depend on ϑ, ϕ
and on the MN coordinates. There are two limit-
ing cases when the Schr¨odinger equation with the
Hamiltonian (1) is separable. The ﬁrst case, Born–
Oppenheimer approximation (BOA), takes place
when the MN rotation is slow compared to the elec-
tron motion. Quantitatively, the diﬀerence between
the energy levels of the MN states with neighbor-
ing j values in BOA is small compared with the
diﬀerence between the excess electron levels. The
opposite limiting case, inverse Born–Oppenheimer
approximation (IBOA) is fulﬁlled when the electron
motion can be considered to be slow compared to the
MN rotation. Thus in IBOA only one term remains

in (2) corresponding to the conserving MN angular
moment j; such wavefunctions were used in rotation-
ally adiabatic theory of rotational autodetachment
of DBA [24].

The procedure of the separation of variables is
given in detail in [25, 26] (BOA) and [27] (IBOA). In
both cases the expression (2) is eﬀectively reduced
to a single-channel radial function multiplied by the
appropriate angular function. The latter has more
simple form in BOA case, so all the following results
(which are not sensitive to the angular dependence
of the electron wavefunction) will be formulated for
BOA case.

in [25, 26] for application to Rydberg states in po-
lar molecules. The functions

an unique case in quantum mechanics (excluding

of bound states of an electron in a macroscopic po-

Of course, this continuous spectrum of bound
states is interesting only from the mathematical
point of view, and connected with the fact that the
Sturm–Liouville problem (4) has a singularity at r =
0. Physically, one should regularize the point dipole
potential at small r. It can be achieved, for instance,
by considering the MN as an extended dipole [4],
taking into account some short-range repulsive core
potential [5, 18]. We use the simplest regularization
model of the nonpenetrating core. The boundary
condition in this model reads as Rκρ(r0) = 0 at
some characteristic value of the MN radius r0. For

sion (7) should be applied carefully to low-excited

hypergeometric functions. Depending on the rela-
tive energy of the MN rotation (i. e., BOA or IBOA),
the parameters s and ρ′ (s′) depend on the dipole
moment as well as on λ, η and the MN rotational

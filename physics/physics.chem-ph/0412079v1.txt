Arrow diagrams (AD) method (L. Kantorovih and B. Zapol, J. Chem. Phys. 96, 8420 (1992); ibid,

8427) provides a onvenient means of systemati alulation of arbitrary matrix elements, hΨ|

AD theorem suggested previously (L. Kantorovih, Int. J. Quant. Chem. 76, 511 (2000)) to deal with

this problem is reexamined in this paper using a simple Hartree-Fok problem of a one-dimensional ring of

in(cid:28)nite size whih is found to be analytially solvable. We (cid:28)nd that orretions to the linked AD theorem

are neessary in a general ase of a (cid:28)nite overlap between di(cid:27)erent eletroni groups. A general method of

onstruting these orretions in a form of a power series expansion with respet to overlap is suggested. It

is illustrated on the ring model system.

Introdution

For a wide range of quantum-mehanial systems, the entire eletroni system an onveniently be split into

a set of eletron groups (EG) suh as ore and valene eletrons in moleules or rystals, eletrons on atoms

or ions in atomi or ioni solids, ore and bond eletrons in strongly ovalent materials, et. [1, 2, 3℄. Similar

partitioning ideas an also be applied to separate eletrons in a luster and environment regions to derive a

partiular embedding potential for the quantum luster [3, 4, 5℄. Provided that the partition sheme applied

to the given system is physially (or hemially) appropriate, one an assume that eletrons (cid:28)xed to the given

group spend most of their time at this group. Therefore, to a good approximation, the wavefuntion of the whole

system onsisting of eletroni groups I an be represented as an antisymmetrised produt of wavefuntions
ΦI (XI ) of every individual group:

where M is the total number of EG's. Here the I -th group is assoiated with NI eletrons whih oordinates
are olleted into a set XI = (x1, . . . xNI ). Note that the single eletron oordinates x = (r, σ) inlude the spin
oordinate σ as well. The antisymmetrisation operator is de(cid:28)ned via

1 aording to the parity of
P . It is assumed here that the group funtions ΦI (XI ) are already individually antisymmetri.

Earlier attempts (see, e.g.

[6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12℄) to simplify the expansion and assoiate eah term with

a transparent diagram have been generalised in Refs.

[13, 14℄ where the Arrow Diagrams (AD) theory was

developed. Firstly, by exploiting a double-oset deomposition of the group SN , many terms in the expansion

were found to be idential and the orresponding rules to number all distint terms were worked out in a

general ase. Seondly, eah distint term in the expansion was given a well-de(cid:28)ned piture (arrow diagram)

whih allowed to onstrut simple rules to assoiate an analytial expression with any of the AD's. The theory

was formulated in a very general way for arbitrary number of eletron groups and expliit AD expansions were

onstruted for redued density matries (RDM) [1, 2℄ of orders one and two (RDM-1 and RDM-2). These

enable one to alulate matrix elements of arbitrary symmetrial one- and two-partile operators and are thus

su(cid:30)ient in most ases relevant to quantum hemistry of moleules and solids (generalisation to higher order

RDM's is umbersome but straightforward).

In general, the suess of this tehnique depends ruially on the value of the overlap between di(cid:27)erent group

funtions ΦI (XI ) and thus their loalisation in ertain regions of spae (also known as struture elements [3℄).

This is beause greater loalisation of the group funtions results in better onvergene of the AD expansion,

i.e. smaller number of terms in the expansion are to be retained. That is why the hoie of eletroni groups

and appropriate regions of their loalisation [15, 16℄ is so important for this method to work.

Although the AD theory formulated in [13, 14℄ is appliable to any system onsisting of arbitrary number of

overlapping eletron groups, one an not diretly use it to desribe an extended (in partiular, in(cid:28)nite) system.

expansions ontain very many terms; in fat, the number of terms is in(cid:28)nite in the ase of an in(cid:28)nite system

arising from the matrix element h
b

(e.g. a solid).

b

It was argued in [17℄ that the normalisation integral S tends to in(cid:28)nity with the number of eletroni groups
M . This assertion made it possible to prove the so-alled linked AD theorem [17℄. It states that the observable

in whih only linked (onneted) ADs are retained (subsript (cid:16)(cid:17)), and the normalisation integral should be

dropped altogether. This expression is very attrative as it allows one to onsider a single AD expansion for

b

b

b

arbitrary matrix elements of operators.

It is the main ob jetive of this paper to show that the linked AD theorem is orret only approximately.

When the overlap between di(cid:27)erent group funtions beomes larger, orretions are to be introdued. We show

this by (cid:28)rst onsidering in detail a simple (cid:16)toy(cid:17) model of a 1D ring for whih the exat analytial solution is

possible. This allows us to investigate in detail the limiting behaviour of the AD expansion for this system when

the number of groups in the ring tends to in(cid:28)nity. Then, we suggest a general method of alulating the mean

values, Eq. (3), in a form of orretions to the linked AD theorem.

The paper is organised as follows.

In the subsequent setion we shall brie(cid:29)y review the AD theory and

introdue the linked AD theorem for the normalisation integral and RDM-1. The onsideration of higher order

RDM's is analogous. In setion 3, we onsider in detail the toy model and obtain an exat expression for RDM-1

in the limit of an in(cid:28)nite ring size. This exat results will then be ompared with that obtained using the linked

2

AD theorem. A systemati way of onstruting orretions to the linked AD theorem is then suggested in

setion 4.

2 The Arrow Diagrams theory

First we onsider a symmetri group SNI . Its elements permute eletroni oordinates belonging only to the I -th
SNM of SN . Any element
group. Joining together all suh groups we obtain a subgroup S0 = SN1 ∪
of S0 only interhanges eletroni oordinates within the groups, i.e. performs only intra-group permutations.

SN2 ∪ · · · ∪

The algebrai foundation of the AD theory is based on the double oset (DC) deomposition of the omplete

symmetri group SN with respet to S0 , whih enables to single out all inequivalent intergroup permutations
PqT [13℄:

b

b

SN =

µqT S0

PqT S0

1
N0

qT
X

b

Here the sum runs over all distint types, q , of operations for intergroup permutations as well as all distint
ways, T , of labelling atual groups (EG's) involved in it, and N0 = N1!N2!
NM ! is a numerial fator.
PqT is a DC generator, whih, involves only inter-group permutations and, in general, an be onstruted as a

· · · · · ·

produt of some primitive yles eah involving no more than one eletron from eah group.

Eah suh a yle is represented as a direted losed loop onneting all groups involved in it. Thus,

in general, eah permutation

PqT an be drawn as an arrow diagram ontaining a olletion of losed direted

loops. These loops may pass through the given group several times (depending on the number of eletrons of the

group whih are involved in the permutation

b

PqT ). If the groups involved in the diagram annot be separated

without destroying the direted loops, the AD is alled linked or onneted.

If, however, this separation is

possible than the diagram is alled non-linked or disonneted and it an be represented as a olletion of linked

parts. The deomposition oe(cid:30)ients µqT an be alulated merely by ounting arrows entering and leaving

b

eah group in the AD.

By writing the antisymmetriser

A of Eq. (2) using the DC generators, it is possible to obtain the diagram

expansion of the normalisation integral [14℄:

where Λ = N0/N ! and Φ =
terms of diagrams idential to those for the permutation group SN of Eq. (4). The matrix elements

Q

are represented as a produt of RDM's of eletroni groups involved in the permutation

E
PqT integrated over
orresponding eletroni oordinates. If eah of the group funtions ΦI is given as a sum of Slater determinants

D

with moleular orbitals expanded via some atomi orbitals (AO) basis set, then the matrix elements

are eventually expressed as a sum of produts of simple overlap integrals between the AO's of di(cid:27)erent eletroni

groups (see,.e.g. Ref. [17℄). It is important to note here that a total ontribution of a non-linked AD is exatly

equal to the produt of ontributions assoiated with eah of its linked parts [14℄.

For the following, it is onvenient to sort out all the terms in the diagrammati expansion by the number of

groups involved in the AD's. Getting rid of the ommon fator Λ, we an write:

where SK(A1, A2,

K di(cid:27)erent groups with the partiular labelling A1, A2, . . . , AK . The unity in equation above orresponds to

· · ·

the trivial permutation.

For onveniene, the expansion in Eq. (6) will be referred to as the normalisation-integral expansion. In

priniple, in this expansion all groups of the entire system partiipate. It is also found onvenient to introdue

a derivative ob jet,

S(T ), whih is obtained from the above expansion by retaining all the AD's whih are

e

A1, . . . , AK
assoiated only with the groups from a (cid:28)nite manifold T =
{
} (i.e. ontaining groups with labels
A1, . . . , AK ). If T omprises the whole system, we arrive at
S of Eq. (6). We shall also introdue a manifold
[T ], i.e. an arti(cid:28)ial system whih is obtained by (cid:16)removing(cid:17) from the entire system all groups omprising the
S[T ] when onvenient) is obtained from Eq. (6) by
set T . Then,
S([T ]) is obtained
retaining only AD's in whih any of the groups belonging to T is not present; in other words,
S by assuming that in any of the AD's all the overlap integrals involving groups from the manifold T are
S[T ] when the manifold T is empty. We

S([T ]) (we shall also use a simpler notation

from

shall oasionally also use the notation

expliitly whih partiular groups are exluded.

The unnormalised RDM-1 of the whole system,

e

Z

an also be written as a matrix element of a ertain symmetrial one-partile operator [1, 2, 14℄. Therefore, as

in the ase of the normalisation integral, by inserting the AD expansion for the operator

A, one obtains the
orresponding AD expansion for the RDM-1 [14℄. It an be onstruted by onsidering the AD expansion of S
and then modifying eah diagram by plaing a small open irle, representing the variables (x, x′), in either of

b

the three following ways: (i) on a group not involved in the diagram; (ii) on a group involved in the diagram,

and, (cid:28)nally, (iii) on an arrow. Thus, eah AD in the S expansion serves as a referene in building up the AD

expansion for the RDM-1. Sine the ontribution of any diagram, onsisting of non-linked parts, is equal to

the produt of ontributions orresponding to eah of the parts, it an be shown [17℄ that, in general, the AD

expansion of the RDM-1 an be represented as

ρ(x; x′) =

where ρt

using the partiular group labelling A1, A2,

neessarily a linked (onneted) AD. One an see from the above equation that eah AD with an open irle,

onstruted from groups T =

(i.e. AD's without the irle),

A1, . . . , AK
{
S[A1, . . . , AK] =

S[T ], onstruted using the rest of the system [T ].

The RDM-1 introdued by Eq. (7) is not normalised to the total number of eletrons in the system sine the

AD expansions, eah ontaining a very large (in(cid:28)nite) number of terms for a large (in(cid:28)nite) system. Thus, it

e
the open irle, ρt

follows from the last passage in Eq. (9), that the true RDM-1 is represented as a sum of all linked AD's with

x; x′), multiplied by numerial pre-fators, f[A1,...,AK ] . The alulation of the

pre-fators poses the main problem in applying the AD theory to in(cid:28)nite or even large system (for small systems

all AD's an be aounted for expliitly and thus ρ an easily be alulated, at least in priniple).

It was argued in [17℄ that in the limit of an in(cid:28)nite system the pre-fators f[T ] tend exatly to unity for any

hoie of the groups T =

A1, . . . , AK

a single AD expansion ontaining only AD's with the open irle whih, as was mentioned earlier, are all linked

{

}. As a result, it was argued that the true RDM-1 an be represented as

AD's. The main argument put forward to prove this so-alled 'linked-AD theorem' was that any

(and, in partiular,

S ) tends to in(cid:28)nity when the number of eletroni groups M tends to in(cid:28)nity.
e

The main ob jetive of this paper is to show that the situation is more subtle. Although the argument about

the limiting behaviour of

the next setion by onsidering an exatly solvable 'toy' model,

e

S[T ] put forward in [17℄ may seem quite plausible, in some ases, as will be shown in
S[T ] may have a zero limit. The main reason

S[A1, . . . , AK]

for this is that ontributions of di(cid:27)erent AD's in the expansion have alternating signs, the point overlooked

previously. As a result, the pre-fators f[T ] do not neessarily tend to unity, but may take a di(cid:27)erent value

e

e

depending on the given system.

Let us onsider a ring of M equally spaed one-eletron groups as shown in Fig. 1 (a ). Eah group is desribed
by a single real s-type normalised wavefuntion ψi(x) (i = 1, 2, . . . , M ) loalised around the group entre. All
groups are idential, i.e. every loalised funtion ψi(x) an be obtained by a orresponding translation of the
neighbouring funtion. Note that N = M for this model and the ring wavefuntion of Eq.

}. Hene, this theory should be equivalent

to the Hartree-Fok (HF) method.

We assume that only neighbouring funtions overlap. Due to the symmetry of the model, only one parameter,

3.1 Finite ring: method based on the inverse of the overlap matrix

It is (cid:28)rst instrutive to perform the alulation using a method whih is ompletely independent of the AD

theory. This is indeed possible sine an expression for the RDM-1 of any HF system an be written expliitly

via orbitals and their overlap matrix [1℄. Taking into aount that only overlap between nearest neighbours

exists, we obtain for the ring eletron density (the diagonal elements of the RDM-1):

Owing to the symmetry of the above introdued determinants, it is possible to derive the following reurrene

The (cid:28)rst one is obtained by opening the determinant of the matrix (12) along its (cid:28)rst row (or olumn), while

the seond relation is obtained in the same way from Eq. (14). Combined with the obvious 'initial' expressions

Note the alternating sign in every next term in the expressions above. Also, in agreement with [17℄, one an see

that numerial pre-fators in eah term grow with inrease of N .

It is now straightforward to investigate the limiting behaviour of these quantities when the number of groups

tends to in(cid:28)nity (the N
→ ∞ limit). We (cid:28)nd, using a simple numerial alulation, that both of them tend
to zero with inrease of N for any value of σ < 0.5 (it will be lear later on that the limit does not exist for
σ

0.5). Sine both GChain

and GRing

orrespond to the normalisation integrals for the two systems, one

N

N

≥

an see that this limiting behaviour is quite di(cid:27)erent from what should have been expeted from the analysis

performed in Ref. [17℄. This is explained by the fat that both limN→∞ GRing

N

and limN→∞ GChain

N

are given

by in(cid:28)nite series with alternating terms. The limiting behaviour of eah of the series is not straightforward in

spite of the fat that the pre-fators to eah term σn

(n = 2, 3, . . .) tend to in(cid:28)nity when N

→ ∞.

In order to alulate the RDM-1 (11), one also need the orresponding elements of the inverse of the overlap

matrix. Using the expliit struture of the matrix S given in Eq. (12), one obtains:

3.2 Finite ring: method based on the AD theory

We shall show in this setion that the same expressions as derived in the previous subsetion an also be obtained

using a muh simpler algebra of the AD theory.

To this end, we (cid:28)rst onsider the normalisation integral

of the ring. Sine all groups ontain

a single eletron and only nearest groups have non-zero overlap, the AD expansion ontains essentially only

bubble-like AD's between two adjaent groups (inluding all non-linked AD's onstruted out of them) and two

AD's onneting al l groups (a N -vertex polygon) with opposite diretion of arrows, as depited in Fig. 2. An
AD expansion for the GChain
1 and N are missing, and (ii) it does not ontain the two polygon diagrams. Reall that there is no (cid:16)onnetion(cid:17)
between the groups 1 and N in the hain.

N

looks similarly. There are two di(cid:27)erenes: (i) bubble AD's ontaining the groups

An AD expansion for the eletron density an also be written expliitly as shown in Fig. 3. It ontains three

terms. The (cid:28)rst term is assoiated with an open irle AD, assoiated with, say, group i, multiplied by all bubble
AD's (shown in the square brakets) whih are onstruted out of the rest N
1, i + 1, . . . , N .
The ontribution of the open irle ρ(◦)

GChain

N −1
to sum over all values of i (all positions of the open irle). Hene, the (cid:28)rst term ontributes GChain
N −1

(and are the same for eah i), sine they represent all AD's for a hain with N

i,i+1 = (

−

and multiplying by a fator of two sine eah AD aepts two diretions of the arrows.

Summing all three ontributions, we arrive at the following expression for the unnormalised eletron density:

Dividing this expression by GRing

N , one obtains the normalised eletron density ρ(x), whih, as an easily be

seen, appears to be idential to that of Eq. (23) obtained in the previous setion using Slater determinants.

To (cid:28)nish the proof of the equivalene of the two methods, we only need to re-derive the reurrene relations

(15) and (16) using exlusively the AD theory.

Consider (cid:28)rst the expansion for GChain

N

bubble-ontaining terms in Fig. 2). Reall that the hain is broken between groups 1 and N . Let us (cid:16)(cid:28)x(cid:17) group
1. Then, GChain

an be written as the sum of two ontributions: (i) due to all diagrams involving group 1

N

whih ontains only zero, one, two, et. bubble diagrams (see the

and (ii) due to the rest of them whih do not involve it. The (cid:28)rst ontribution is simply a single bubble AD

, times all the bubble AD's made of all the other groups, i.e. the whole

Eq. (15) is proven in a similar way. Again, we (cid:28)rst (cid:16)(cid:28)x(cid:17) group 1. Then, the sum of all AD's shown in Fig.

2 is equal to the sum of three ontributions: (i) GChain
N −1 due to all AD's whih do not involve group 1; (ii) all
the bubble AD's involving it, given by 2
N −2 analogously to the ase of the hain disussed above (the
fator of two arises due to the fat that one an onstrut two bubble AD's with group 1, namely those involving

In(cid:28)nite ring

Our task now is to alulate the pre-fators (in the round brakets) in the expression for the density of Eq.

(23). To do this, it was found onvenient to introdue the following quantity:

Using expliit expressions for the GChain

not very large overlap. This restrition is a onsequene of the nearest-neighbour approximation adopted in our

toy model. Note in passing that PN > 0 for any N .

Hene, χN of Eq. (29) has a zero limit and disappears in the ratios (27) and (28). Consequently, ξN

0 too

(see Eq. (31)), so that the third term in the right hand side of Eq. (23) also does not ontribute when the limit

of an in(cid:28)nite ring is taken.

Finally, ombining all ontributions, we obtain the following exat result for the in(cid:28)nite ring:

The above obtained expression for the normalised density an be ompared diretly with the general formula

(9). Aording to the linked-AD theorem [17℄, both pre-fators are equal to unity for any σ . We see, however,
that is not the ase in general. The atual pre-fators f[i] and f[i,i+1] are plotted in Figs. 4 and 5, respetively,
for the whole range of the overlap integral σ by solid lines.

One an learly see that for 0

σ

≤

(cid:22)

0.3, i.e.

for the small and intermediate overlap, both pre-fators

are approximately equal to unity, whih is the value predited by the linked-AD theorem. However, when the

σ < 0.5, both pre-fators shoot up to in(cid:28)nity.
overlap between neighbouring group funtions is larger, 0.3
Note that the singularity at σ = 0.5 is somewhat arti(cid:28)ial and is removed if the nearest-neighbour approximation

≺

for the overlap is lifted.

Thus, we onlude, that the linked-AD theorem works well in the region of not very large overlap, i.e. when

the group funtions are su(cid:30)iently loalised. If the overlap is large, then orretions to the linked-AD theorem

are neessary. A general method for building up suh orretions will be suggested in the next setion.

4 Corretions to the linked-AD theorem

The idea of the method to be proposed in this setion is based on the power series expansion for the pre-fators.

In order to illustrate the general method, it is instrutive to onsider (cid:28)rst a simple example of the familiar 1D

toy model.

4.1 Series expansion for the 1D toy model

Let us onsider the 1D toy model (an in(cid:28)nite ring) for whih the exat solution is known. Fix group 1. Then,

the normalisation integral for the whole ring,

S , an be onstruted as a sum of three terms: (i) all AD's of the
S[1], where T = [1] orresponds to the ring with group 1 (cid:16)removed(cid:17), i.e. this group does not

rest of the system,

have any overlap with its neighbours; (ii) a bubble AD between groups 1 and 2 (ontributing −

S[1, 2] (as usual, [1, 2] denotes the system in whih groups

e

by all possible bubble AD's due to all other groups,

σ2

) multiplied

1 and 2 are removed), and similarly (iii) a bubble AD between group 1 and the last group in the ring (the

e

e

other neighbour of group 1) times all the bubble AD's of the rest of the system. The last two ontributions

are idential. Note that we do not onsider the polygon here as we know (setion 3.3) that in the limit of an

S =

S[1]

2σ2

S[1, 2]. Dividing both sides of

in(cid:28)nite system its ontribution vanishes. Thus, one an write:

this equation by

S , we obtain an equation onneting pre-fators:
e
2σ2f[1,2]

1 = f[1] −

e

−

e

e

Repeating the above proedure for the system [1] and (cid:28)xing group 2, we similarly obtain:
σ2

−
S[1, 2, 3], where [1, 2, 3] denotes a system in whih groups 1, 2 and 3 are removed. In fat, the above equation
S , we obtain another relationship

S[1] =

S[1, 2]

e

e

also follows from the reurrene relation (16). Dividing the last equation by

Continuing this proedure, one an write an in(cid:28)nite series of relationships in whih every time a new pre-fator

e

between pre-fators:

appears, for instane:

Next, we assume that the pre-fators are well-de(cid:28)ned funtions of the overlap, σ . Hene, they all an be

expanded in a power series:

f[1] = f[1,2] −

σ2f[1,2,3]

e

f[1,2] = f[1,2,3] −

σ2f[1,2,3,4]

f[1,2,3] = f[1,2,3,4] −

σ2f[1,2,3,4,5]

where T is either 1 or 1, 2 or 1, 2, 3 and so on. Note that the expansion starts from the unity for any [T ] sine
f[T ] = 1 for zero overlap (σ = 0). Substituting these expansions into Eqs. (36)-(39), one an reursively reover
the expansion oe(cid:30)ients up to a ertain order by omparing terms of the same power of σ . Indeed, it follows
from Eq. (36) that a[1]
1 = 0,
≥
a[1,2]
2 = a[1]
3. Similarly, we obtain from Eq. (38) that:
a[1,2,3]

reursive relationships, new oe(cid:30)ients an be obtained, e.g. a[1,2]
4 = 6, a[1]
3 = 0, a[1]
5 = 0,
a[1]
6 = 20. Using Eq. (39) enables alulation of more oe(cid:30)ients. This way we obtain the (cid:28)rst several terms in

2 = 2 and a[1]

f[1,2] = 1 + 3σ2 + 10σ4 + 35σ6 + . . .

(41)

(42)

It an easily be seen by expanding in a power series the exat expressions (34) and (35) for the pre-fators, that

the above expansions are indeed orret. To obtain more terms in the expansion by using this method, one has

to onsider higher order pre-fators. The expansions for f[1] and f[1,2] obtained above are ompared with the

exat expressions of Eqs. (34) and (35), respetively, in Figs. 4 and 5. One an see that in both ases reasonable

approximations to the exat values of the pre-fators are obtained using the power series expansion in the ases

of small and intermediate overlap. It is also apparent that one has to go to higher orders in the expansions

when the overlap is muh larger. In partiular, the power series expansions do not show sharp inrease of the

pre-fators loser to the ritial overlap σ = 1
2 .

4.2 General method

The idea of the series expansion method of the previous subsetion an atually be generalised for an ar-

bitrary system ontaining groups with any numbers of eletrons, i.e.

for the most general wavefuntion of

Eq. (1). Indeed, what is needed is a way to onnet the pre-fator f[T ] =
T =
iated with a smal ler set [T ′] = [T
∆T =

∆T ] = [T + ∆T ]. The set T ′

The orresponding relationship between the two pre-fators an be obtained as follows. Consider the sum

S[T ] for the subsystem [T ]. From all of

of all possible AD's whih make up the entire normalisation integral

them we separate out those whih are related to the set [T + ∆T ]:

The (cid:28)rst term in the right hand side ontains all the AD's that an be onstruted out of the groups of the set

S(∆T ). These should be multiplied by all AD's onstruted out of the rest of the groups, i.e. by
∆T , given by
all groups from the manifold [T + ∆T ]. The seond term ontains all the AD's whih are formed by the groups
belonging to both sets ∆T and [T + ∆T ]. Indeed, the double sum piks up subsets T1 and T2 from the manifolds
of groups ∆T and [T + ∆T ], respetively. The sum of all possible AD's onstruted using every group from T1
and T2 is denoted
D(T1T2) may ontain non-linked diagrams as well; however, in

It is seen that f[T ] is represented as a linear ombination of pre-fators orresponding to smal ler systems: if

T is the number of groups in the manifold T , then we an write that ℵ[T ] >

ℵ[T +∆T ] >

ℵ

is a generalisation of any of the Eqs. (36) - (39) written above for the toy model.

Equations like the one written above allow one to obtain the neessary series expansion in the general ase.

To this end, we attah to every diagram a fator σn
with the power n being the order of the AD, i.e. the number
of arrows it ontains. The expansion we obtain will be with respet to σ that will be set to unity at the end of

the alulation. Note that this method does not take into aount an additional fator, whih is relevant in the

atual alulation, that the ontributions of the AD's also depend on the distanes between di(cid:27)erent groups. In

the method we propose an expansion with respet to overlap integrals will be obtained.

To illustrate how the method works, we shall obtain a few (cid:28)rst terms in the expansion for f[A] , f[A,B] and
∅ (empty) and ∆T = A in Eq. (44):

S(A) = 1, we start, similarly to setion 4.1, with T =

The expression for the pre-fator f[A] was obtained up to the 5-th order with respet to overlap. Expansions
for f[AB] and f[ABC] are obtained up to the fourth order with respet to overlap using the same equations

AD's (with the open irle) whih are also of some order with respet to the overlap, third and seond order

expansions are needed for f[AB] and f[ABC] , respetively, if the same order expression for the RDM-1 is to be

It is seen that in all orders the (cid:28)rst-order term vanishes, i.e. a[T ]

1 = 0.

Note that the hoie of manifolds T and ∆T is somewhat arbitrary. Any hoie results in the same expansions.

However, the method outlined above is, in our view, the simplest one whih leads to a systemati derivation of

the expansion oe(cid:30)ients for the pre-fators of inreasingly higher orders.

5 Conlusions

In this paper we have re-examined the (cid:16)linked-AD theorem(cid:17) of Ref.

[17℄ formulated for extended (in(cid:28)nite)

systems ontaining a very large number of eletroni groups. For example, in the ase of the eletron density,

the theorem states that the pre-fators, f[T ] , to the linked AD's with an open irle (involving groups of the
set T ) are all equal to unity. By analysing in detail an exatly solvable system (1D Hartree-Fok ring with a

single eletron in eah group and the nearest neighbours non-zero overlap), we (cid:28)nd, however, that this theorem

is only approximately valid when the group wavefuntions are strongly loalised. When this is not the ase, so

that the overlap between neighbouring groups is signi(cid:28)ant, orretions to the theorem have to be applied and

the pre-fators may strongly deviate from the value of unity.

To obtain suh orretions, a general method based on the expansion of the pre-fators in power series with

respet to overlap between di(cid:27)erent groups, has been suggested. To illustrate the method, we have obtained in

detail the orretions for the (cid:28)rst three pre-fators in the expression for the RDM-1, namely: (i) f[A] (assoiated
with the irle AD); (ii) f[AB] (a bubble AD with an open irle on an arrow) and (iii) f[ABC] (a triangle AD

with an open irle on an arrow), as shown in Fig. 10. Other pre-fators an be obtained along the same lines.

Note that expressions for the pre-fators do not depend on the partiular type (topology q , see setion 2) of
the AD with an open irle; they only depend on the partiular groups (the set T ) involved in the diagram.

Due to this, the same pre-fators will appear in the expansion of the RDM-2 as well. Several (cid:28)rst terms in the

expansion of the latter are shown in Fig. 11. The (cid:28)lled and open blak irles designate the variables (x, x′)
and (y, y′) of the RDM-2 ρ (x, y

x′, y′) , respetively (see [17, 14℄ for more details).

Therefore, an energy expression up to arbitrary order with respet to overlap an (cid:28)nally be obtained taking

into aount the desribed orretions to the linked-AD theorem. It is di(cid:27)erent from that presented previously

17

[17℄ only by the appearane of the pre-fators, so that we do not show it here in detail.

It is relevant to note that an expansion of the eletron density with respet to the overlap in the Hartree-Fok

ase (with no eletron orrelation within groups inluded) is well known [1℄. It is obtained from Eq. (11) by

representing the overlap matrix S as S = 1 + ∆ and then expanding S−1 = (1 + ∆)
matrix ∆; the latter ontains only overlap between di(cid:27)erent groups and zeros along the diagonal. The method

with respet to the

−1

developed in this paper in setion 4.2 generalises this expansion method to the ase when group funtions are

linear ombinations of Slater determinants, i.e. when intra-group orrelation e(cid:27)ets are aounted for in eah

group. However, it is also known (see, e.g. [18℄) that the overlap expansion of the eletron density in the HF

ase diverges if the overlap between groups is signi(cid:28)ant (more expliitly, if there is at least one eigenvalue of

∆ whih is larger than unity). Therefore, our method should also have some limitations on its onvergene and

must be applied with are.

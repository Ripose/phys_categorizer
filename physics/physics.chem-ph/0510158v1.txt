Classic simulations are used to study interlayer structure, swelling curves, and stability of Ca-
montmorillonite hydrates. For this purpose, N PzzT and µPzzT ensembles are sampled for ground
level and given burial conditions. For ground level conditions, a double layer hydrate having 15.0 ˚A
of basal spacing is the predominant state for relative vapor pressures (p/p0) ranging in 0.6-1.0. A
triple hydrate counting on 17.9 ˚A of interlaminar distance was also found stable for p/p0=1.0. For
low vapor pressures, the system may produce a less hydrated but still double layer state with 13.5 ˚A
or even a single layer hydrate with 12.2 ˚A of interlaminar distance. This depends on the established
initial conditions. On the other hand, the eﬀect of burial conditions is two sided. It was found that
it enhances dehydration for all vapor pressures except for saturation, where swelling is promoted.

INTRODUCTION

Clay minerals are negatively charged layer type alumi-
nosilicates kept together by cations. Since they consti-
tute a great portion of soils and sedimentary rocks, their
study impacts on podology, geology, geochemistry and
ecology. Clays such as smectite group1 have the ability
of absorbing water among clay sheets (interlayer spaces),
in some cases producing a remarkable expansion of the
mineral. This expansion is ﬁrstly crystalline (few water
layers), and an osmotic regime is archived for higher wa-
ter interlaminar contents2. The study of ions interacting
with hydrated clay minerals is of particular interest, as
they rule the swelling capacity of a given clay.

In engineered settings, clay mineral swelling is a critical
factor in problems such as borehole stability in petroleum
extraction, and in the liner and buﬀer stability in the con-
tainment of hazardous waste in geoenvironmental tech-
nology. One way to stabilize the shale is by reducing
the swelling capacity of the clay by means of replacing
sodium ions with divalent calcium ones through cation
exchange methods1,3,4,5. Literature reports indicate that
clays containing exchangeable calcium ions swell not as
much as sodium clays, which are known to swell up to
form water clay dispersions1,5,6,7. This makes calcium
chloride solutions the preferred internal phase of most oil-
based drilling ﬂuids. Additionally, calcium ions control
water activity. This determines the osmotic movement of
water between the drilling ﬂuid and the formation, which
may reduce the clay swelling when it is correctly handled.
Thus, a detailed knowledge of the stability of the Ca-clay
hydrates under diﬀerent water activities is a key for an
appropriate mud design.

As well as other Ca-montmorillonite simulation
studies8,9, this work deals with the microscopic mech-
anisms underlaying Ca-montmorillonite swelling, but fo-
cussing on the stability of the diﬀerent hydrates in con-
tact with several reservoirs. These reservoirs diﬀer in
temperature, pressure, and composition (water activity).
In order to ﬁx these variables, the µPzzT ensemble is

sampled, where µ refers to the water chemical potential
of the reservoir. Since it is related to the relative partial
water vapor pressure, plots of interlaminar distances and
number of water molecules against it are constructed. For
ground level conditions (P= 1 atm and T= 298K), these
plots are directly accessed by experiments, making the
comparison easy. Since good agreement was found, we
expect the model to predict the behavior of the system
for other non easily implementable experimental condi-
tions. That is, for a given average burial depth. Hence,
we studied the behavior of the model under P= 600 atm
and T= 394K, i. e., for 4 km of depth assuming average
gradients of 30 K/km and 150 atm/km. We expect these
data to be useful for developing drilling strategies.

This article is organized as follows.

In Sec. II, we
brieﬂy describe the models and the methodology em-
ployed for performing the simulations. The results are
shown in Sec. III. Finally, Sec. IV summarizes the main
results and extracts some conclusions.

II. METHODOLOGY

A. The model

×

A montmorillonite clay simulation supercell was con-
structed by a 4
2 replication of the cell given by Skip-
per et al.10. The only diﬀerence is that in our model
the octahedral oxygen sites have a charge of -1.52e,
and their corresponding hydrogen sites have a charge of
0.52e. This is for a better accordance with the TIP4P
model11, which was employed for modelling water12. A
Wyoming type montmorillonite was obtained by isomor-
phous substitutions of trivalent Al atoms of the octa-
hedral sites by divalent Mg atoms, and tetravalent Si
of the tetrahedral sites by trivalent Al atoms. The re-
18.28 ˚A
sulting layer counts on dimensions of 21.12
in the (x, y) plane and a thickness of 6.56 ˚A. Water
molecules were randomly distributed in the interlaminar
spaces. The negative charge of the clay framework was

The corresponding Lennard-Jones parameters for dif-
ferent species are given in Table I. Parameters for Si were
taken from Marry et al.14, and parameters for Al and Mg
were assumed to be equal to those of Si.

The Ca-O and Ca-H interactions are based on the ones
proposed by Bounds15, since they produce Ca-TIP4P ra-
dial distribution functions in agreement with available
experimental data and close to hybrid quantum mechan-
ics/ molecular mechanics (QM/MM) results. That is,
the Ca-O radial distribution function peaks at 2.54 ˚A
leading to a ﬁrst shell oxygen coordination number of
9.3, while the experimental results are close to 2,46 ˚A16
and a wide range of coordination numbers turn into 6.0-
10.016,17,18,19. On the other hand, hybrid QM/MM sim-
ulations performed at DFT level (LANL2DZ basis sets)
lead to 2.51 ˚A of Ca-O distance and a coordination num-
ber of 8.120. The pair potential reads

Since it is crucial for the hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC)
simulations to keep the energy ﬂuctuations as low as pos-
sible in order to enlarge the acceptation rate21, it is con-
venient to avoid employing relatively long range pair po-
r−4, if no Ewald treat-
tential contributions, such as
ment is applied on them. Thus, we reﬁtted to equation

. We observed that by
r−4 term, the acceptance rate enlarges
avoiding the
more than three times for a small (inner) time step of
10−4 ps, this being the typical value. To check the
8
reliability of this Bound based Ca-water potential, N P T
simulations with 216 water molecules, a calcium cation,
and two chloride anions were performed. From the ra-
dial distribution functions we observed that the ﬁrst and
second oxygen shells are situated at 2.53 and 4.43 ˚A re-
spectively, while for Ca-H they are at 3.05 and 5.05 ˚A.
The coordination number for the ﬁrst oxygen coordina-
tion shell is 8.75. These values are in agreement with
experimental data and are casually closer than Bound’s
potential results to those obtained by Schwenk et al.20
Additionally, results also compare well with those re-
ported by D. G. Bounds15. Therefore, expression 5 seems
suitable for describing the Ca-TIP4P interactions.

Periodic boundary conditions were imposed on the
three space directions. The electrostatic interactions
r−1 are computed using the Ewald summation method,
∼
and a spherical cutoﬀ equal to half the smallest box side
is set for the short range interactions. Standard correc-
tions for the short range interactions were considered22.

B. Simulations

Our simulation methodology is based on previous
work23 thus it is not discussed in detail here. The sim-
ulations were performed employing a HMC method21,23.
A reversible multiple time scale algorithm24 is employed
as discretization scheme. The long time step is set up
to 8 times the short time step, and the short time step
is chosen to obtain an average acceptance probability of
0.721. To keep time correlations as low as possible, a new
conﬁguration is generated each 10 integration steps. The
probability to accept this new conﬁguration is

For sampling in the N PzzT ensemble the stress normal

The µPzzT ensemble is sampled by simply perform-
ing particle movements,
insertions and deletions, and
box changes as in typical N V T , µV T , and N PzzT
samplings23. Water insertions and deletions were per-
formed by Rosenbluth sampling23,26. Diﬀerent types
of movements are called just like explained elsewhere23.
This algorithm provides a good way of sampling this kind
of systems, since only one run is necessary to obtain the
equilibrium state at reservoir conditions. This contrasts
with the more frequently used µV T sampling, that leads
to similar information after a large number of simula-
tion runs8,25,26,27,28.
It should be also mentioned that
in typical x-ray experiments the ambient vapor pressure,
the total pressure, and the temperature are controlled,
but not the water content of the interlaminar space or
the interlaminar distance. These are exactly the same
variables that are setup in a µPzzT simulation, which
consequently allows for a fair comparison. On the other
hand, N PzzT and µV T ensembles may force the system
to pass trough equilibrium states that are not produced
in real experiments. This is the case of water contents
equivalent to 55 water molecules per interlaminar space
or interlaminar distances of 13 ˚A for sodium montmoril-
lonite, since they do not correspond to a single or to a

double water hydrate. Nevertheless, one may artiﬁcially
produce these states by simply ﬁxing N or V in N PzzT or
µV T sampling. Measuring the water chemical potential
for the ﬁrst case29, or the pressure for the second25, large
values of chemical potential and pressure are obtained.
In fact, these variables show oscillations when obtained
as a function of N or V , indicating that several equilib-
rium states are possible25,29. These measurements also
suggest the existence of energetic barriers that separates
the single, double, and triple layer hydrates. Since in
µPzzT sampling the interlaminar distance and the num-
ber of water molecules are free variables, these states
are simply avoided, splitting the phase space in two (or
more) regions. For these cases, two (or more) diﬀerent
equilibrium states appear, which are accessed by han-
dling initial conditions. This way, hysteresis cycles are
naturally obtained.

III. RESULTS

The swelling curve obtained for ground level condi-
tions, i. e. P=1 atm and T=298 K, is shown in ﬁgure
1. Here, each data point is obtained by performing a
N PzzT simulation and hence, by ﬁxing the number of wa-
ter molecules. This ﬁgure also includes the data reported
by Ch´avez-P´aez et al.25 and by Greathouse and Storm9.
As can be seen, our data compare very well with those of
Ch´avez-P´aez et al. Since methodologies and models are
similar this is something expected. Larger diﬀerences are
seen between our data and those reported by Greathouse
and Storm, who employed the Lennard-Jones type Ca-O
potential given by Aquist30. These diﬀerences point out
to a general weakness associated with the use of classi-
cal force ﬁelds, which may be overcome by employing ab
initio molecular dynamics simulations. This was success-
fully done by Boek et al.31

Systems counting on 40, 60, 90 and 120 water
molecules (wm) per interlaminar space produce 12.0,
13.4, 15.0, and 17.9 ˚A of interlaminar distance. The
ﬁrst one corresponds to a single water layer forma-
tion. The last two are frequently observed in experi-
ments and should correspond to double and triple water
layer hydrates, while the interlaminar distance of 13.4
˚A is sometimes obtained experimentally for small vapor
pressures32,33,34. The corresponding oxygen, hydrogen,
and calcium proﬁles are shown in ﬁgure 2. Oxygen peaks
of this ﬁgure make clear that the structures correspond to
a single water layer hydrate, to two double layer hydrates,
and to a three layer hydrate, from left to right. It also
shows that the double layers structures diﬀer on their hy-
drogen and calcium proﬁles. These calcium proﬁles pass
from two double peaks located close to the clay layers,
suggesting the formation of diﬀerent types of inner-sphere
complexes, to a structure having a very important middle
peak, indicating the formation of outer-sphere complexes.
This tendency for calcium ions to detach from the surface
with increasing water content agree with the predictions
of Greathouse and Storm9.

To conﬁrm the presence of inner and outer-sphere com-
plexes some snapshots were analyzed. From them ﬁgure
3 was built, where only those water molecules having Ca-
O distances smaller than 3.0 ˚A are shown. Two inner-
sphere complexes are seen, 3 a) and b), and an outer-
sphere complex, 3 c). The complex shown in ﬁgure 3
a) has no tetrahedral substitution involved, whereas in
ﬁgure 3 b) the calcium ion is attached to a tetrahedral
substitution. As can be seen, two oxygens coordinate
with the ion for the ﬁrst case, and the three surrounding
the aluminium atom in the second. In both cases, 6 wm
complete the inner sphere shell.
In addition, distances
from clay oxygens are much smaller when the tetrahe-
dral substitution is involved. These diﬀerent coordina-
tion distances explain the calcium double peaks seen in
ﬁgure 2 b). On the other hand, 8 wm form the inner
sphere shell in case of outer-sphere complexes, in agree-
ment with simulations9 and experimental evidence35. For
double layer hydrates, these complexes are situated close
to the interlayer midplane, leading to Ca-O distances for
clay oxygens in the range of 4.3-5.0 ˚A (these distances
are not highlighted in the ﬁgure).
It should be noted
that they are similar to the Ca-O distances found for the
water second shell that surrounds calcium in bulk water.
Hence, this may enhance the double layer stability.

In order to build swelling curves as a function of the
water vapor pressure of a reservoir in contact with the
system, the µPzzT ensemble was sampled. The rela-
tionship between the chemical potential and the vapor
pressure is βµ = βµ0 + ln(p/p0), where p0 is the vapor
pressure at equilibrium with liquid water whose chemi-
cal potential is µ0, and p is the vapor pressure. For the
TIP4P model, 1 atm, and 298 K, we employed βµ0= -
17.423,25.
In case of 600 atm and 394 K the employed
value is -13.423.

A sampling example from the µPzzT ensemble is shown

guide to the eye.

respectively.

in ﬁgure 4. Here, the interlaminar distance, the wa-
ter amount of each interlaminar space, and the average
amount of water are plotted against the simulation step.
For this particular case the simulation was started from
an almost dehydrated state in contact with a reservoir
having p=0.8p0, and for ground level conditions.
It is
seen how water molecules enter the system thickening
the interlaminar distance. It is also noticed that once the
system yields some of the interlaminar structures shown
in ﬁgure 2, it shows certain resistance to swell to another
state. For example, the resistance at 12.4 ˚A, correspond-
ing to a single water layer hydrate, is overcome once the
simulation has spent close to 8000 steps. Immediately af-
ter overcoming this resistance, the interlaminar distance
jumps from 12.4 to 13.5 ˚A. This means that the interlam-
inar space rearranges from the single water layer shown
in ﬁgure 2 a) to the double water layer corresponding
to ﬁgure 2 b). Clearly, this rearrangement implies over-
coming a sort of collective potential barrier. Something
similar happens with the transition from the double layer
hydrate at 13.5 ˚A towards the structure shown in ﬁgure
2 c), although the rearrangement seems to be gradual.
Here, most ions leave the surface to locate close to the
interlaminar midplane. Finally, the system yields a sta-
ble state close to 15.0 ˚A (stable at least for the ﬁnite
number of considered steps, but conﬁrmed by other runs
having starting conﬁgurations closer to this ﬁnal state).

We consider that the resistances found for rearrang-
ing the interlaminar structures point to local free energy
minima, and their relative depths under the given con-
ditions should be directly related to the number of steps
the simulation spends on them. However, due to the
stochastic character of this number, several runs should

be performed to obtain some reliable averages.

The swelling curves for ground level conditions are
shown in ﬁgure 5. To generate them, four starting con-
ﬁgurations were considered. These are: an almost dehy-
drated state having 10 wm and 12.0 ˚A of interlaminar
space, 60 wm - 15.0 ˚A, 90 wm - 16.0 ˚A, and 120 wm -
18.5 ˚A of interlaminar space. These conﬁgurations pro-
duce single, double, and triple layer hydrates in a few

simulation steps.
with these states, both, water content and interlaminar
distance just ﬂuctuate around certain mean values. On
the contrary, if vapor pressure is not consistent with the
hydrate, this is destabilized, producing another number
of water layers. This is the case shown in ﬁgure 4. Lim-
iting cases are the dehydrated state (no water molecules
remain in the system) and the fully hydrated state (where
the simulation leads to an ever increasing number of wa-
ter molecules).

≥

As expected, independently of the initial conditions,
the simulations for p = 0 yield the dehydrated state,
counting on an interlaminar distance of 9.9 ˚A, in agree-
ment with the N PzzT results. On the other hand, and
also no mattering what the established initial conditions
are, for p
0.6p0 a double layer hydrate is always ob-
tained, except for a saturated vapor pressure where a
triple layer hydrate is also possible. The structure of this
double layer hydrate is consistent with that shown in ﬁg-
ure 2 c). It has a water content close to 87 wm and an
interlaminar space about 15.0 ˚A. On the other hand, the
triple layer hydrate structure looks like that shown in ﬁg-
ure 2 d) and has 17.9 ˚A of interlaminar space and close
to 119 wm.

For vapor pressures ranging in 0.1 - 0.4p0, things are
more complicated. Here, two equilibrium states were ob-

served for p=0.4, 0.2, and 0.1p0. These are: two diﬀerent
double layer hydrates for p=0.4p0; and a single and a dou-
ble layer hydrates for p=0.2 and 0.1p0. These two double
layer hydrates are those shown in ﬁgure 2 b) and c). As
already mentioned, they diﬀer on their water content and
on their water-ion structure. The single hydrate shows
interlaminar distances close to 12.2 ˚A. This hydrate was
found stable just in the range of 0.1 - 0.2p0, and the dou-
ble layer hydrate with the smallest interlaminar distance
is stable for p = 0.1 - 0.4p0. This completes the de-
scription for the swelling of Ca-montmorillonite hydrates,
showing two closed hysteresis loops for small water vapor
pressures.

The obtained data are in good agreement with experi-
mental results. In order to clearly see it, ﬁgure 5 includes
the experimental data obtained by Hendricks et al.33,
Tamura et al.36 and Mooney et al.32. Here, not only the
interlaminar distances for the single, double, and triple
hydrates are reasonably matched but also their relative
vapor pressure range. For example, the experimental
basal spacing distances for the single layer hydrate range
in 11.9-12.5 ˚A; 15.0-15.2 ˚A are the values reported for
the double layer hydrate; and 17.7-18.1 ˚A are those re-
ported for the triple hydrate32,36,37. Moreover, they even
seem to support the interlaminar distances obtained for
the double layer hydrate shown in ﬁgure 2 b). Therefore,
values that range in 12.8-13.8 ˚A for small water vapor
pressures32,33,34 may correspond to our double layer of
60 wm per interlaminar space.

The number of water molecules contained in the sys-
tem also match the data given by Mooney et al.32.
We should mention here that for converting their data
it
from water content to number of water molecules,
was assumed that 96 wm correspond to 300 mg H2O/g
clay9,12,38. The data plotted in ﬁgure 5 under the label
Mooney et al. were obtained this way. As can be seen,
the agreement is remarkable.

The swelling curve obtained for burial conditions and
by means of N PzzT sampling is shown in ﬁgure 6. We
also include the one obtained for ground conditions, for
comparison. It is seen that for small water contents, both
curves almost coincide. As water content increases, the
curve obtained for burial conditions produces larger in-
terlaminar spaces. Another eﬀect is that the ﬁrst plateau
shortens, and a double layer formation is observed for wa-
ter contents as low as 50 wm. Here, the ﬁrst double layer
plateau ranges in 50-60 wm, and there seems to be a sec-
ond in the range 70-80 wm. This plateau displacement
is due to the large eﬀective volume the water molecules
occupy for burial depth, being just a consequence of the
larger temperature29.

The structures of the systems that correspond to the
diﬀerent plateaus are similar to those already shown in
ﬁgure 2. The main diﬀerence is that proﬁle peaks widen
and shorten due to higher thermal energy. This was also
observed by means of experiments39. Something similar
happens with the Ca-O radial distribution functions, al-
though the ﬁrst shell coordination numbers remain quite

the same.

Figure 7 shows the swelling curves obtained for burial
conditions. Just like ﬁgure 5, the water amount is not
ﬁxed since sampling was performed in the µPzzT ensem-
ble. Therefore, in general, several diﬀerent equilibrium
states appear as a function of the imposed reservoir’s
vapor pressure, which are accessed by handling initial
conditions. Figure 7 also includes the results for ground
level conditions with dotted lines, for an easier compari-
son. To begin with, let us focus on the data obtained by
starting from an almost dehydrated state. As expected,
the full dehydration is only obtained for p=0. This has a
very similar interlaminar distance than the one obtained
for ground level conditions. For 0.1p0
0.3p0, the
single water hydrate is yielded. This contrasts with the
vapor pressure range obtained for the single hydrate at
ground level conditions, which is shorter. This suggests
that dehydration is favored for burial conditions. This
hydrate counts on an interlaminar distance similar to
that obtained for ground level conditions, although with
a smaller water content. Again, this points towards the
larger eﬀective volume occupied by water molecules at
higher temperatures.
It is also seen that for a vapor
pressure of p=0.4p0, the system produces a double layer
hydrate having 13.3 ˚A of interlaminar distance and 58
wm. This signatures the end of the single water layer
domain.

The results for an initial condition of 60 wm and 15.0 ˚A
of interlaminar distance are as follows. For p = 0.1-0.2p0
the double layer hydrate is destabilized and a single layer
hydrate is produced. In the range 0.3p0
0.6p0, this
initial condition leads to a double layer hydrate similar to
that shown in ﬁgure 2 b). This state has an interlaminar
distance close to 13.3 ˚A and a water content of 58 wm.
Our data indicate that for p = 0.4 and 0.6 p0 it turns into
the only stable state. Hence, for p = 0.6 p0 the structure

FIG. 7: Interlaminar distance and number of water molecules
per interlaminar space as a function of the vapor pressure for
burial conditions. Symbols (cid:3), ◦ and △ correspond to initial
conditions of 10 wm - 12.0 ˚A, 60 wm - 15.0 ˚A, and 90 wm -
16.0 ˚A of interlaminar distance, respectively.

2 c) obtained under ground level conditions is also desta-
bilized in favor of the structure 2 b). All this points to a
dehydration process occurring at burial depths as well.

The initial condition of 90 wm and 16.0 ˚A of interlam-
inar distance produces the double layer hydrate having
15.0 ˚A of interlaminar distance only for p = 0.8p0. For
a saturated vapor pressure the hydrate becomes unsta-
ble and a full hydration is observed. On the other hand,
it dehydrates for p = 0.6p0. Therefore, it seems that
burial conditions favor dehydration for all vapor pres-
sures except for saturation, that, on the contrary, pro-
motes swelling.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

Ca-montmorillonite hydrates were studied by means of
N PzzT and µPzzT simulations. Interlaminar structures
and swelling curves for a ﬁxed amount of water were ana-
lyzed by N PzzT sampling, whereas the µPzzT ensemble
was used to build swelling curves as a function of the
reservoir relative vapor pressure. Both ground level and
burial conditions were considered.

Results indicate that under ground level conditions
four interlayer structures are possible. For small rela-
tive vapor pressures, a single or a double layer hydrate

7

with a low water content are obtained, counting on 12.2
and 13.4 ˚A of interlaminar distance, respectively. For
larger relative vapor pressures, a double hydrate with a
higher water content and 15.0 ˚A of interlaminar distance
is obtained. Finally, a three layer hydrate with 17.9 ˚A of
interlaminar distance was detected for water vapor sat-
uration. All these data well agree with experimental re-
sults.

It was observed that the more hydrated the system
becomes, more ions fully hydrate to form outer-sphere
complexes. In other words, inner-sphere complexes are

mentioned that these outer-sphere complexes in double
layer hydrates present part of their second water shell
substituted by oxygen atoms of the two adjacent clay
layers. This aids to counterbalance the expanding pres-
sure the water molecules exert on the clay sheets. On the
other hand, calcium ion lowers the interlaminar space wa-
ter activity, favoring the entrance of water thus producing
denser systems. This causes higher expanding pressures
to deal with. Hence, it was not a priory clear if calcium
ions were going to produce stable hydrates under all en-
vironments.

Burial conditions enhance dehydration for all vapor
pressures except for saturation. This last case was found
to provoke swelling. We should mentioned that a real
reservoir with a saturated vapor pressure is not likely to
occur, since there are always dissociated electrolytes that
lower water activity. Thus, one can not expect this ex-
treme case to happen in a real reservoir. For example,
Wang et al.40 were able to relate the dehydration tem-
perature of montmorillonite in calcium solutions with its
water activity, ﬁnding that relatively small quantities of
calcium chloride produce a large enough drop of the vapor
pressure to considerably lower dehydration temperature.
In fact, this explains the extensive use of calcium chloride
as the internal phase of oil-based drilling ﬂuids. From ﬁg-
ure 7, it is concluded that a drop of vapor pressure not
only prevents swelling but also favors dehydration, in-
deed. Therefore, we consider that the most important
role of calcium ion as swelling inhibitor is just to lower
the water activity of the reservoir in contact with the
montmorillonite hydrate system.

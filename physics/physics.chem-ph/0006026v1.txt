Abstract

An ‘ab initio’ molecular dynamics simulation of a Na+ ion in aqueous solution
is presented and discussed. The calculation treats a Na+ ion and 32 water
molecules with periodic boundary conditions on a cubic volume determined
by an estimate of zero partial molar volume for this solute in water at normal
density and at a temperature of 344 ± 24 K. Analysis of the last half of the 12
ps trajectory shows 4.6 water molecules occupying the inner hydration shell
of the Na+ ion on average, with 5 being the most probable occupancy. The
self-diﬀusion coeﬃcient observed for the Na+ is 1.0×10−5 cm2/s. The quasi-
chemical theory of solutions provides the framework for two more calculations.
First a complementary calculation, based on electronic structure results for
ion-water clusters hydrated by a dielectric continuum model of the solution,
predicts an average hydration shell occupancy of 4.0. This underestimate can
be attributed to the harmonic approximation of interactions within the clus-
ters and to the approximate treatment with the dielectric continuum model
of extra-cluster contributions to the free energy of solvation. Finally, an in-
formation theory ﬁt of the simulation data leads to an an absolute hydration
free energy estimate of -80 kcal/mol.

1. Introduction

Solvation of simple ions in aqueous solution is not yet fully understood despite its funda-
mental importance to chemical and biological processes. For example, disagreement persists
regarding the hydration number of the Na+ ion in liquid water. A pertinent problem of
current interest centers on the selectivity of biological ion channels; it seems clear that the
selective transport of K+ relative to Na+ ions in potassium channels [1–3] depends on details
of the ion hydration that might diﬀer for K+ relative to Na+.

Experimental eﬀorts to deﬁne the hydration structure of Na+(aq) using diﬀraction [4,5]
and spectroscopic [6] methods produce a hydration number ranging between four and six
[7]. Simulations have obtained a range of values, but most predict six water molecules in the
inner hydration sphere of the Na+ ion [8–19]. An ‘ab initio’ molecular dynamics simulation
produced ﬁve inner shell water molecules neighboring Na+(aq) [20].

An important limitation of theoretical studies of ion hydration concerns the suﬃciency of
model force ﬁelds used in classical statistical mechanical calculations. In the most custom-
ary approaches, interatomic force ﬁelds used in theories or simulations derive from empirical
ﬁts of a parameterized model to a variety of experimental data.
‘Ab initio’ molecular dy-
namics avoids this intermediate modeling step by approximate solution of the electronic
Schroedinger equation for each conﬁguration of the nuclei [21,22]. This technique thus goes
signiﬁcantly beyond conventional simulations regarding the accuracy of the force ﬁelds. It
also augments theories built more directly on electronic structure studies of ion-water com-
plexes by adopting approximate descriptions of the solution environment of those complexes
[23–28].

Relative to conventional simulations, ‘ab initio’ molecular dynamics simulations also
have some important limitations due to the high computational demand. Applications of
the method have been restricted to small systems simulated for short times. For example, an
‘ab initio’ molecular dynamics study [20] of the Na+(aq) ion comparable to the present work
obtained a thermal trajectory lasting 3 ps after minimal thermal aging. The present work,
though still limited to relatively small systems, pushes such calculations to longer times that
might permit more precise determination for Na+(aq) of primitive hydration properties. The
analysis here utilizes the last half of a 12 ps thermal trajectory. The quasi-chemical theory
+ complexes assist in this
[23–27] and separate electronic structure calculations on Na(H2O)n
analysis.

2. Methods

The system consisted of one Na+ ion and 32 water molecules in a cubic box with edge
9.86518 ˚A and periodic boundary conditions. The dimensions of the box correspond to a
water density of 1 g/cm3 and zero partial molar volume for the solute. Initial conditions
were obtained as in an earlier ‘ab initio’ molecular dynamics simulation on Li+(aq) [23].
+ complex was
In that earlier work, an optimized structure for the inner sphere Li(H2O)6
equilibrated with 26 water molecules under conventional simulation conditions for liquid
water, utilizing a current model force ﬁeld and assuming a partial molar volume of zero. In
the present calculation, the same pre-equilibrated system was used as an initial conﬁguration
for the ‘ab initio’ molecular dynamics except that an optimized structure for the inner
+ complex replaced the hexa-coordinated Li+ structure. Constant pressure

or constant water activity simulations, deﬁned by intensive rather than extensive variables,
probably would produce a more useful characterization of the solvent thermodynamic state
for these small systems, but those alternatives are currently impractical.

Molecular dynamics calculations based upon a gradient-corrected electron density func-
tional description of the electronic structure and interatomic forces were carried out on this
Na+(aq) system utilizing the VASP program [29]. The ions were represented by ultrasoft
pseudopotentials [30] and a kinetic energy cutoﬀ of 31.5 Rydberg limited the plane wave
basis expansions of the valence electronic wave functions. The equations of motion were
integrated in time steps of 1 fs, which is small enough to sample the lowest vibrational
frequency of water. A thermostat constrained the system temperature to 300 K during the
ﬁrst 4.3 ps of simulation time. After removing the thermostat, the temperature rose slightly
and then leveled oﬀ by 6 ps to an average of 344 ± 24 K. During the simulation, the initial
n=6 hydration structure relaxed into n=4 and n=5 alternatives, such as those shown in
Fig. 1. All analyses reported here rely on the trajectory generated subsequent to the 6 ps
of aging with the system at a temperature elevated from room temperature.

3. Results

The ion-oxygen radial distribution function is shown in Fig. 2. The ﬁrst maximum occurs
at a radius of 2.35 ˚A from the Na+ ion and the minimum at radius 3.12 ˚A demarcates the
boundary of the ﬁrst and innermost hydration shell. An average of hni=4.6 water molecules
occupy the inner hydration shell. Fig. 3 tracks the instantaneous number of water oxygen
atoms found within the ﬁrst hydration shell of the Na+, deﬁned by radius r≤3.12 ˚A for
the upper panel. The fractions x4 and x5 of four-coordinate and ﬁve-coordinate hydration
structures, respectively, constitute x4=40% and x5=56% of the last 6 ps of the simulation.
Structures in which the Na+ ion acquires six innershell water molecules occur with a 4%
frequency, while structures with three and seven innershell water molecules occur less than
1% of the time. Analysis of the mean-square displacement of the Na+ ion (Fig. 4) produces
a self-diﬀusion constant of 1.0×10−5 cm2/s, which agrees reasonably well with experimental
results [31].

These results correspond coarsely with an ‘ab initio’ molecular dynamics calculation on
this system carried-out independently [20]. The most probable inner shell occupancy found
there was also ﬁve, but the probabilities of n=4 and n=6 were reversed from what we ﬁnd
here. This diﬀerence may be associated with the lower temperature used in Ref [20].

With the present data, we attempted to determine x0, the unobserved fraction of zero-
coordinate hydration structures, using a maximum entropy ﬁtting procedure [32,33]. The
motivation for this arises from the quasi-chemical theory of solutions, according to which x0
contributes to µex
N a+, the excess chemical potential or absolute hydration free energy of the
ion in liquid water [27],

Here the inner shell is deﬁned by specifying a function bNa+j that is equal to one (1) when sol-
vent molecule j is inside the deﬁned inner shell and zero (0) otherwise; ∆U is the interaction
energy of the solvent with the solute Na+ that is treated as a test particle, β −1=kBT, and

3

the subscript zero associated with h. . .i0 indicates a test particle average [27]. The second
term on the right-hand side of Eq. (1) is the excess chemical potential of the solute lacking
inner shell solvent molecules whereas the ﬁrst term is the free energy of allowing solvent
molecules to occupy the inner shell. The validity of Eq. (1) has been established elsewhere
[27]. The ﬁrst term on the right of Eq. 1 is referred to as the chemical contribution and the
second term is the outer sphere contribution to the excess chemical potential.

The utility of this quasi-chemical formulation is the suggestion [32] of more detailed
study of the xn, the fractions of n-coordinate hydration structures found in solution, on the
basis of the equilibria forming inner shell complexes of diﬀerent aggregation number:

the normalized xn can be expressed as

The ρσ are the number densities and, in particular, ρH2O is the molecule number density
of liquid water. If the medium external to the clusters is neglected, the equilibrium ratios,
(0), can be obtained from electronic structure calculations on the complexes,
denoted as Kn
assuming the harmonic approximation for the thermal motion of the atoms. Finally uti-
lization of a dielectric continuum approximation for the outer sphere contributions to the
chemical potential gives a natural, though approximate, quasi-chemical model [23–28].

For the present problem, the quasi-chemical model was implemented following precisely
the procedures of the earlier study of Li+(aq) [23], except that the sodium ion cavity radius
for the dielectric model calculation was assigned as RN a+=3.1 ˚A, the distance of the ﬁrst
minimum of the radial distribution function of Fig. 2. The temperature and density used
were 344 K and 1.0 g/cm3 and the value of the bulk dielectric constant was 65.3 [34].

Results of the calculations are summarized in Fig. 5. The electronic structure results
are consonant with those found previously for the Li+ ion. The n=4 inner sphere gas-phase
complex has the lowest free energy. Outer sphere placements are obtained for additional
water molecules in the minimum energy structures of larger clusters. Nevertheless, attention
is here restricted to inner sphere structures. The mean occupation number predicted by this
quasi-chemical model is hni = 4.0; the computed absolute hydration free energy of the Na+
ion under these conditions is -103 kcal/mol, not including any repulsive force (packing)
contributions. An experimental value for Na+ ion in liquid water at room temperature is
-87 kcal/mol [35].

The populations obtained from the quasi-chemical model, ˆxn, can serve as a default model
for a maximum entropy inference of xn using the observed ‘ab initio’ molecular dynamics
data [32]. As outlined above, there is particular interest in estimating the fraction of non-
occupied hydration structures, x0, because of its relationship in quasi-chemical theory to the
absolute hydration free energy of the ion. In this approach we model

for j = 0, 1, 2, . . . .

The results of this inference were problematical and it is clear that more data and theory
will be required to make this a useful technique for extending data from ‘ab initio’ molecular
dynamics simulations. Fig. 6 gives a record of qualitatively reasonable results obtained.

One diﬃculty is that the ‘ab initio’ molecular dynamics observes a nonzero x7. Uti-
lizing the electronic structure methods, we found no minimum energy inner-sphere hepta-
coordinated clusters; see also Ref. [36]. Furthermore, the observed x7 is likely to be relatively
less accurate and it is furthest away from the n=0 element that is desired. Therefore, in the
ﬁrst ﬁtting attempt, we excluded n=7 conﬁgurations of the ‘ab initio’ molecular dynamics
and renormalized the probabilities xn and moments obtained for n<7. As the upper panel in
Fig. 6 shows, this simple maximum entropy model is qualitatively satisfactory although not
quantitatively convincing. The chemical contribution suggested by Fig. 6 is approximately
-68 kcal/mol. Using the Born formula, q2(1 − 1/ǫ)/2R with R=3.1 ˚A, to estimate the outer
sphere contributions represented by the last term in Eq. 1, then the net absolute hydration
free energy falls in the neighborhood of -120 kcal/mol. Since experimental values for the
absolute hydration free energy at room temperature center around -90 kcal/mol, this com-
parison shows that the present free energy results are not to be interpreted quantitatively,
but rather as indicative of the present state of the theory.

The packing contributions that have been neglected here may be much more substantial
than has been assumed and, more generally, the outer sphere contributions require more
speciﬁc consideration. Better default models should help and it is natural to think of using
conventional simulation results with model force ﬁelds for default models ˆxn. Order-of-
magnitude increases in the sizes of the simulated system and in the simulation time would
help, but are unlikely in the near future.

In a second attempt to ﬁt the simulation data, we used all the probabilities observed
in the simulation, including x7. Since the quasi-chemical results produced too narrow a
distribution, we substituted the broader ideal gas or Gibbs distribution for the default
model, ˆxn ∝ 1/n!. The results, illustrated in the middle panel of Fig. 6, show an improved
ﬁt. Here the chemical contribution to the free energy is -28 kcal/mol, yielding a net absolute
hydration free energy of -81 kcal/mol when the same Born formula is used to estimate the
outer sphere contributions.

A more speciﬁc identiﬁcation of the diﬃculty with the maximum entropy modeling is
associated with diﬀerent behavior of the xn results for n≤4 and for n≥5. Previous ‘ab initio’
molecular dynamics on K+(aq) similarly hints that the innermost four water molecules have
a special status [36]. The radial distribution function of Fig. 2, somewhat better resolved
than heretofore, is relevant to this issue. It is clear that Fig. 2 doesn’t rule out the possibility
of two populations of water molecules within r<3.1 ˚A, although it doesn’t speciﬁcally suggest
that possibility either.

We can achieve a more faithful ﬁt of the data following these ideas even in the regret-
table absence of further theory and simulation speciﬁc to this problem. This better ﬁtting

5

requires, however, more aggressive hypotheses motivated by the following points. Firstly,
the electronic structure calculations on clusters failed to ﬁnd a stable n=7 cluster despite
the fact that an n=7 component was seen in the ‘ab initio’ molecular dynamics. This intro-
duced some ambiguity in the ﬁrst ﬁtting. Secondly, naive ﬁtting of the available xn suggest
diﬀerent simple forms for the n≤4 and for n≥5 ranges. Together, these points suggest that
more restrictive deﬁnitions of inner sphere geometries might be helpful for these chemically
motivated approaches. Thirdly, as the second ﬁtting showed, maximum entropy modeling is
more eﬀective when the default model is broader than the observed distribution. In view of
these points, we tried a ﬁnal ﬁt in which we ﬁrst reduced the radius deﬁning the inner sphere
to R=2.68 ˚A, for which <n> is close to 4 (see bottom panel of Fig. 2). This produced a new
set of data points from the molecular dynamics simulation. distribution. Additionally, we
again abandoned the cluster harmonic default model and adopted the broader Gibbs default
model. The results, shown in the lowest panel of Fig. 6, suggest ln x0 ≈ -25, which translates
to -17 kcal/mol as a chemical contribution. If we again use the Born approximation for the
outer sphere contribution, this time with R=2.68 ˚A, we obtain an absolute hydration free
energy estimate of -78 kcal/mol.

4. Conclusions

The ‘ab initio’ molecular dynamics simulation predicts the most probable occupancy
of the inner shell of Na+(aq) to be 5 and the mean occupancy to be 4.6 water molecules
at inﬁnite dilution, T=344 K, and a nominal water density of 1 g/cm3. The simulation
produces both a satisfactory Na-O radial distribution function and self-diﬀusion coeﬃcient
for Na+, but these satisfactory results required more care with thermalization and averaging
time than is most common with these demanding calculations.

The complementary calculation framed in terms of quasi-chemical theory and based on
electronic structure results for ion-water clusters, interacting harmonically and solvated in
a dielectric continuum, underestimates the average and most probable inner shell water
molecule occupancy for Na+ in liquid water. Maximum entropy ﬁtting of the inner shell
occupancy distribution shows that the ion-water cluster results yield a distribution signiﬁ-
cantly narrower than that obtained from the simulations. For this reason, inference of the
absolute hydration free energy of Na+(aq) based on the cluster electronic structure results
and utilizing information gleaned from the ‘ab initio’ molecular dynamics failed; a variety of
theoretical issues, such as anharmonicity in the small clusters and reﬁnement of a solution
model, require further consideration.

Abandonment of the cluster electronic structure results in favor of a broader default
model improved the ﬁt of the simulation data. In an even more aggressive ﬁtting scheme,
new data was gathered from the simulation using a more restrictive deﬁnition of the inner
hydration shell that allowed an occupation of just 4 water molecules on average and the ﬁt
again proceeded with the broader default model. Both of these ﬁts produced a satisfactory
prediction of -80 kcal/mol for the absolute hydration free energy of Na+ in liquid water at
a temperature elevated from room temperature.

We acknowledge helpful discussions of many related issues with Gerhard Hummer and
Joel Kress. This work was supported by the US Department of Energy under contract

of inner shell water neighbors at T=344 K and ρH2O=1 g/cm3. The lowest results (open
diamonds) show quasi-chemical approximate values for the liquid, labelled according to the
quasi-chemical interpretation. This graph indicates that the n=4 inner sphere structure is
most probable under these conditions. The radius used for the Na+ ion here is 3.1 ˚A, though
a substantial reduction of this value produced only a minor change in the inferred absolute
hydration free energy; otherwise the procedure is the same as in previous reports [23,27]. The
absolute hydration free energy predicted here is -103 kcal/mol. The results marked ∆G(0)
(ﬁlled circles) are the free energies predicted for the reaction Na+ + n H2O in an ideal gas at
p = 1 atm ≡ p0 and T=344 K. The minimum value is at n=4. The middle graph (crosses)
add to the ideal gas results the ‘replacement’ contribution −nRT ln [RTρH2O/p0] = −n ∗ 5.03
kcal/mol with T=344 K, and ρH2O =1 g/cm3.

Figure 6. Results for the inference of x0 from ‘ab initio’ molecular dynamics information.
The solid points represent the information measured from the molecular dynamics simula-
tion, the dotted lines refer to the default models, and the solid lines show the ﬁt achieved by
the information theory approach. In the top panel, the observed inner hydration occupancy
x7 was excluded and the quasi-chemical default model moments used were hni=4.633 and
hn(n − 1)/2ii=8.577. In the middle panel, all xn observed in the simulation were included,
and a Gibbs default model was used along with the same moments as above. The bottom
panel shows the results of more aggressive ﬁtting using the restrictive inner sphere radius
of R=2.68 ˚A and the moments hni=4.046, and hn(n − 1)/2ii=6.393 with the Gibbs default
model.

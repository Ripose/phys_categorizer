Abstract

Extensive ab initio calibration calculations combined with extrapolations to-

wards the inﬁnite-basis limit lead to a ground-state dissociation energy of

Be2, De=944±25 cm−1, substantially higher than the accepted experimental

value, and conﬁrming recent theoretical ﬁndings. Our best computed spectro-

scopic observables (expt. values in parameters) are G(1)−G(0)=223.7 (223.8),

G(2) − G(1)=173.8 (169±3), G(3) − G(2)=125.4 (122±3), and B0=0.6086

(0.609) cm−1; revised spectroscopic constants are proposed. Multireference

calculations based on a full valence CAS(4/8) reference space suﬀer from

an unbalanced description of angular correlation; for the utmost accuracy,

the (3s, 3p) orbitals should be added to the reference space. The quality of

computed coupled cluster results depends crucially on the description of con-

nected triple excitations; the CC5SD(T) method yields unusually good results

because of an error compensation.

I. INTRODUCTION

Despite the small size of the beryllium dimer, Be2, a correct computational description

of its X 1Σ+ ground state has long been considered as one of the most challenging problems

in quantum chemistry. [1] Intuitively one would expect a purely repulsive potential between

two closed-shell singlet atoms — or perhaps a shallow van der Waals-like minimum — and

1

in fact the Hartree-Fock potential is purely repulsive. However, the small (2s) − (2p) gap

in atomic beryllium complicates the picture, and when angular correlation is admitted, a

tightly bound molecule is in fact found due to an avoided crossing between (2s)2 + (2s)2 and

(2s)1(2pz)1 + (2s)1(2pz)1 curves. As a result, the wave function is strongly biconﬁgurational,

and in fact an active space of at least four orbitals (the abovementioned plus (2s)1(2pz)1 +

(2s)2 and (2s)2 + (2s)1(2pz)1) is required to obtain a qualitatively correct potential curve [2].

The Hartree-Fock limit potential is purely repulsive, and early coupled cluster with all

double excitations (CCD) calculations [3] found only a shallow van der Waals-like minimum.

Multireference conﬁguration interaction studies [4,5] on the other hand predicted a tightly

bound minimum, as did (with a highly exaggerated binding energy) a pioneering density

functional study [6]. These conclusions were corroborated in 1983 by a valence FCI (full

conﬁguration interaction) study [7], and in the next year, Bondybey and English [8] re-

ported the ﬁrst experimental observation. Bondybey [9] subsequently reported Re=2.45 ˚A

and the ﬁrst four vibrational quanta 223.2, 169.7, 122.5, and 79 cm−1; assuming a Morse

potential, he suggested a dissociation energy of 790±30 cm−1. Petersson and Shirley (PS)

[10], following ab initio calculations of their own, re-analyzed the experimental data in terms

of a Morse+1/R6 potential and suggested an upward revision to De=839±10 cm−1. Recent

high-level calculations suggest even higher binding energies: for instance, St¨arck and Meyer

[11] (SM), using MRCI (multireference conﬁguration interaction) and a core polarization

potential (CPP) found De=893 cm−1 as well as re=2.4485 ˚A, while MR-AQCC (multirefer-

ence averaged quadratic coupled cluster [12]) calculations by F¨usti-Moln´ar and Szalay [13]

(FS) established De=864 cm−1 as a lower bound. Røeggen and Alml¨of (RA) [1] carried out

extensive calibration calculations with an extended geminal model and gave 841±18 cm−1

as their best estimated binding energy. Evangelisti et al. (EBG) [14] carried out valence-

only FCI calculations in a [6s5p3d2f 1g] basis set, and concluded that inner-shell correlation

must contribute substantially to the binding energy since their value (an exact valence-only

solution within this large basis set) was still appreciably removed from experiment. This

conclusion was conﬁrmed by an all-electron FCI in a small [9s2p1d] basis set (which still

2

involved in excess of 109 determinants) [15].

Part of the uncertainty in the best theoretical values resides in the fact that the basis

sets used, while quite large, are still ﬁnite. Convergence of angular correlation is known

to be excruciatingly slow, with an asymptotic expansion in terms of the maximum angular

momentum l that starts at l−4 for contributions of individual angular momenta and at l−3 for

overall l-truncation error [16]. Recently l-extrapolations have been proposed [17,18] which

permitted the calculation of total atomization energies of small polyatomic molecules with

mean absolute errors as low as 0.12 kcal/mol. Among other applications, this method made

possible a deﬁnitive re-evaluation [19] of the heat of vaporization of boron from a calibration

In the present work, we apply this method to the dissociation energy of Be2. It will be

shown that the valence-only basis set limit is in fact as large as 875±10 cm−1, and the overall

quality calculation on BF3.

De as large as 945±20 cm−1.

II. METHODS

The multireference and FCI calculations, as well as those using the CCSD(T) [20] coupled

cluster method, were carried out using a prerelease version of MOLPRO97 1 running on an

SGI Origin 2000 minisupercomputer at the Weizmann Institute of Science. Calculations with

other coupled cluster methods were carried out using ACES II2 running on a DEC Alpha

Most basis sets used belong to the correlation consistent polarized valence n-tuple zeta

(cc-pVnZ) family of Dunning [21]. The cc-pVDZ, cc-pVTZ, cc-pVQZ and cc-pV5Z basis

sets are [3s2p1d], [4s3p2d1f ], [5s4p3d2f 1g], and [6s5p4d3f 2g1h] contractions, respectively,

of (9s4p1d), (11s5p2s1d), (12s6p3d2f 1g), and (14s8p4d3f 2g1h) primitive sets. For assessing

inner-shell correlation eﬀects, we used the core correlation basis set of Martin and Taylor

[22]: MTvtz and MTvqz denote completely uncontracted cc-pVTZ and cc-pVQZ basis sets,

respectively, augmented with one tight p, three tight d, and two tight f functions with

exponents derived by successively multiplying the highest exponent already in the basis set

with a factor of three. The MTv5z basis set is obtained similarly, but in addition has a single

tight g function as well.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

A. Valence electron contribution

For the cc-pVDZ, cc-pVTZ, and cc-pVQZ basis sets, valence-only FCI calculations could

be carried out. The results at the reference geometry R = 2.45 ˚A are given in Table 1.

By comparison with CCD, CCSD [23], and CCSDT [24] results in the same basis sets

(CCSDTQ being equivalent to FCI for this case), we can partition the valence binding energy

into contributions from connected single, double, triple, and quadruple excitations as well

as investigate their basis set convergence. As previously noted by Sosa et al. [25] in small

basis sets, no covalent binding is seen at the CCSD level; they found CCSDT-1{a,b} and

CCSDT-2 to display only a shallow ripple, while CCSDT-4 slightly exaggerates the potential

well and full CCSDT is slightly above the FCI result. These conclusions are conﬁrmed here;

moreover, as the basis set is increased, the CCSDT results closely track the FCI ones, which

in this case implies that the contribution of connected quadruples to the binding converges

very rapidly to an estimated basis set limit of 85 cm−1. By contrast, the contribution of

connected triples is actually substantially larger than the atomization energy itself, and is

apparently not yet converged with the cc-pVQZ basis set.

Our attempts to carry out a CCSDT/cc-pV5Z calculation with the available computer in-

frastructure met with failure. CCSD(T) calculations are an obvious alternative, but are seen

in Table 1 to on the one hand underestimate the importance of connected triple excitations,

and on the other hand to display considerable basis set dependence in the diﬀerence with

full CCSDT (hence making it a poor candidate for extrapolation). The diﬀerence between

CCSD(T) and CCSDT starts at ﬁfth order in perturbation theory; in the method alterna-

tively known as CCSD+T(CCSD)* [26] and, in Bartlett’s recent notation [27], CC5SD(T),

the missing E5T T term is included quasiperturbatively at a computational expense scaling as

occn5
n3

virt. As seen in Table 1, CC5SD(T) slightly overestimates the connected triple excita-

tions contribution but does so in a highly systematic manner, the diﬀerence being constant

between 38 and 40 cm−1. Because of an error compensation with neglect of connected

quadruple excitations, it is actually the one single-reference method short of full CI that

we ﬁnd to be closest to the exact solution. In short, it is the ideal candidate for basis set

extrapolation.

The CCSD+TQ(CCSD)* or CC5SD(TQ) method, which includes the leading contribu-

tion of connected quadruple excitations in a similar fashion, appears to seriously overestimate

it, and we have not considered it further.

Basis set superposition error for the valence electrons was considered using the standard

counterpoise (CP) correction [28]. In the present case, it drops from 36 cm−1 (cc-pVDZ) over

24 (cc-pVTZ) to 6 cm−1 for the cc-pVQZ basis set, and a paltry 3.5 cm−1 for the cc-pV5Z

basis set.

From the FCI/cc-pV{D,T,Q}Z results, we may attempt extrapolation, either from the

uncorrected De values (assuming that the extrapolation will absorb BSSE which strictly

vanishes at the basis set limit) or after subtracting the counterpoise correction in each case.

5

With a variable-α 3-parameter correction, this leads to basis set limits of 841 and 859 cm−1,

respectively. Using the simple A + B/l3 formula [29] on just the ﬁnal two results, we obtain

values of 863 (raw) and 870 (CP-corrected) cm−1.

It can rightly be argued that the cc-pVDZ basis set is really too small to be involved

in this type of extrapolation, and that a cc-pV5Z result is essential for this purpose. This

requires us to estimate an FCI/cc-pV5Z result from the additivity approximation Method/cc-

pV5Z+FCI/cc-pVQZ−Method/cc-pVQZ. With Method=CC5SD(T), we obtain De(FCI/cc-

pV5Z)≈818.2 cm−1; 3-point extrapolation yields 881 cm−1 for the raw, and 872 cm−1 for the

CP-corrected, results as the basis set limit. Using the simple A + B/l3 formula, we obtain

the alternative results 857 and 873 cm−1, respectively. The fact that the two extrapolations

yield essentially the same result for the CP-corrected values, as well as that they are in very

close agreement with the results with the smaller basis sets, is very satisfying.

It could likewise be argued that in fact the SCF and correlation contributions should be

handled separately [18], with an exponential or (l + 1/2)−5 formula for the SCF contribution

and an A + B/(l + 1/2)α or A + B/l3 formula for the correlation contribution alone. We

then ﬁnd that the SCF contribution, with the cc-pV5Z basis set, lies within 3 cm−1 of the

numerical HF limit; after adding in the basis set limits for the correlation contribution, we

obtain, after counterpoise correction, 869 cm−1 with the 3-point and 871 cm−1 with the

2-point formula.

One further objection would be to the use of even a high-level single-reference method

for a problem that is intrinsically multireference in character. We have therefore considered

MRCI (multireference conﬁguration interaction) augmented with the multireference David-

son correction [30], MRACPF [31] (multireference averaged coupled pair functional), and

MRAQCC [12] (multireference averaged quadruples coupled cluster) methods with a variety

of active spaces. A 4/4 active space appears to be unsatisfactory for our purposes; hence

we have considered full-valence CAS(4/8)-ACPF (averaged coupled pair functional [31]) and

CAS(4/8)-AQCC as alternatives. Except for the cc-pVDZ basis set, both methods seem to

track the FCI results quite closely, with CAS(4/8)-ACPF accidentally coinciding with the

6

FCI results. Again applying the same additivity approximation as above, we obtain esti-

mated FCI/cc-pV5Z results from these calculations of 821.5 and 819.6 cm−1, especially the

latter quite close to the CC5SD(T) derived value.

Interestingly, the CAS(4/8)-ACPF wave function contains a fairly large number of exter-

nal excitations with fairly high amplitudes, most of them involving excitation into (3p)-type

Rydberg orbitals. Inspection of the atomic wave function for Be atom revealed that excita-

tions into the fairly low-lying (3p) orbitals have amplitudes as large as 0.09 (for each of three

symmetry-equivalent components); since in addition the (3s) orbital is below the (3p) or-

bital in energy and there appears to be no clear separation between (3s)- and (3pz)-derived

σ orbitals, this suggests a (4/16) active space which spans all molecular orbitals derived

from atomic (2s, 2p, 3s, 3p) orbitals. External excitations now carry so little weight in the

wave function that CAS(4/16)-MRCI+Dav, CAS(4/16)-ACPF and CAS(4/16)-AQCC yield

essentially identical results. Arbitrarily selecting the CAS(4/16)-ACPF result for extrapola-

tion, we obtain a best estimate of 821.5 cm−1 for the FCI/cc-pV5Z De. After counterpoise

correction, the CAS(4/16)-ACPF derived value leads to a basis set limit value of 885.6 cm−1

with the 3-point and 861.4 cm−1 with the 2-point formula. Taking the average of the latter

two values and the CC5SD(T) derived ones, we ﬁnally propose 872±15 cm−1 as our best

estimate for the valence-only De.

As a ﬁnal remark, let it be noted that the extrapolations in all cases bridge an area of no

more than 50–70 cm−1; by substituting l = 6 in the extrapolation fomulas, we can estimate

that calculations with the next large basis set, cc-pV6Z (i.e. [7s6p5d4f3g2h1i]), would only

recover about 20–25 cm−1 of that total.

B. Inner-shell contribution

By taking the diﬀerence between their computed MRCI results with and without the

core polarization potential, SM found that inner-shell correlation would add 0.38 mEh, or 83

cm−1, to the atomization energy. RA computed a contribution of (1s) correlation (almost

7

exclusively core-valence correlation) of 0.40654 mEh, or 89.2 cm−1.

Our results for the eﬀect of inner-shell correlation are collected in Table 2. Using the

MTvtz, MTvqz, and MTv5z basis sets in succession at the CAS(4/16)-ACPF level. we ﬁnd

contributions of inner-shell correlation to the binding energy of 82.1, 80.6, and 77.8 cm−1.

BSSE contributions to the core-correlation contribution (taken as the diﬀerence between

all-electron and valence-only BSSEs in the same basis set) are 3.8, 2.9, and 1.5 cm−1, re-

spectively, such that the counterpoise-corrected values of 78.3, 77.7, and 76.3 cm−1 appear

to be quite handsomely converged.

For comparison, the counterpoise-corrected CCSD(T) results are 75.0, 73.1, and 70.9

cm−1, while a CC5SD(T)/MTvtz calculation yielded 63.3 cm−1 without counterpoise cor-

rection. CAS(4/4)-ACPF and CAS(4/8)-ACPF calculation actually yielded small negative

inner-shell correlation contributions which are clearly an artifact of the reference space.

We also note that the counterpoise-corrected all-electron CAS(4/16)-ACPF/cc-pV5Z De

of 882.4 kcal/mol is already higher than the FS number, and in fact near the SM value.

Indeed, since this level of electron correlation appears to systematically underestimate the

valence binding energy by 15–16 cm−1 compared to FCI (see Table 1), we can establish 900

cm−1 as a lower limit to De.

Adding the best inner-shell correlation energy contribution of 76.2 cm−1 to our best

valence binding energy, we obtain a best estimate for the all-electron binding energy of

948±20 cm−1, where the increased error bar reﬂects the added uncertainty in the inner-shell

contribution.

The eﬀect of scalar relativistic eﬀects was gauged from Darwin and mass-velocity terms

obtained from CAS(4/16)-ACPF/MTvqz calculations by perturbation theory [32]. At −4.0

cm−1, it is essentially negligible.

Combining our best estimates for valence, inner-shell, and relativistic contributions, we

ﬁnally obtain a best estimate for De(Be2) of 944 ±25 cm−1, which suggests that the PS value
for De may need to be revised upward by as much as 100 cm−1.

8

C. Potential curve

Computed bond distances re, harmonic frequencies ωe, and the ﬁrst three anharmonicities

ωexe, ωeye, and ωeze are collected in Table 3. They were obtained by a Dunham analysis

on eighth-order polynomials ﬁtted to some 25 computed energies at bond distances spaced

around the putative minimum with distances of 0.02 ˚A.

While good ﬁts could be obtained to the CCSD(T) and CC5SD(T) results, attempts

to ﬁt CAS(4/8)-{MRCI,ACPF,AQCC} curves in the same manner met with failure. No

such problem was encountered with results based on a smaller CAS(4/4) reference wave

function: investigation of the CASSCF energies revealed that while the CAS(4/4) curve is

bound, the CAS(4/8) curve is purely repulsive in the region sampled. Further investigation

revealed that with increasing r, amplitudes for excitations into (3p) derived Rydberg orbitals

progressive take on pathological dimensions (as large as 0.35): under such circumstances,

the noisy character of the CAS(4/8)-ACPF potential curves should not come as a surprise.

As expected, expanding the reference space to CAS(4/16) eliminates the problem, as well

as restores a bound CASSCF potential curve. Apparently the (2p) and (3p) orbitals are

close enough in importance that a balanced reference space requires that they either be both

included or both excluded.

From comparing CAS(4/16)-ACPF/cc-pVTZ and FCI/cc-pVTZ spectroscopic constants,

it is obvious that the former treatment is indeed very close to an exact solution and the

method of choice for 1-particle basis set calibration. CC5SD(T) yields surprisingly good re

and ωe values (in fact agreeing more closely with FCI than CCSDT) but strongly overesti-

mates the anharmonicity of the curve. Performance of CCSD(T) is fairly poor, although the

quality of the results is still amazing considering the pathological character of the molecule.

Extension of the basis set to cc-pVQZ has a very signiﬁcant eﬀect on the spectroscopic

constants, with re being shortened by 0.026 ˚A and ωe going up by 16 cm−1. Further extension

to cc-pV5Z has a much milder eﬀect, and suggests that convergence is being approached for

the molecular properties. A + B/l3 extrapolation suggests that further basis set extension

9

may aﬀect re by a further −0.003 ˚A and increase ωe by another +2 cm−1.

Ideally, we would have liked to present all-electron CAS(4/16)-ACPF/MTv5z curves

in order to include inner-shell correlation. Since however a single point in such a curve

took more than a day of CPU time on an SGI Origin 2000, we have not pursued this

option further, and have instead contented ourselves with considering the diﬀerence between

CCSD(T)/MTv5z curves with and without constraining the (1s)-like orbitals to be doubly

occupied. Our results suggest that inner-shell correlation reduces re by 0.03 ˚A and increases

ωe by 14 cm−1. The spectroscopic constants given as ‘best estimate’ are obtained by adding

these contributions to the extrapolated CAS(4/16)-ACPF/cc-pV∞Z results, as well as the

small diﬀerence between FCI/cc-pVTZ and CAS(4/16)-ACPF/cc-pVTZ.

Obviously, given the highly anharmonic nature of the potential surface, a Dunham-type

perturbation theory analysis is not appropriate. Like in our recent calibration study on

the ﬁrst-row diatomic hydrides, we have transformed our 8th-order Dunham expansion and

computed dissociation energy to a variable-beta Morse (VBM) potential [33]

Vc = De (cid:16)1 − exp[−z(1 + b1z + b2z2 + . . . + b6z6)](cid:17)

2

(1)

in which z ≡ β(r − re)/re and the parameters bn and β are obtained by derivative matching

as discussed in detail in Ref. [34]. The one-dimensional Schr¨odinger equation was then

integrated using the algorithm of Balint-Kurti et al. [35], on a grid of 256 points over the

interval [0.2re, 3re].

The results for the ﬁrst four vibrational quanta are given in Table IV. We have considered

three potentials. The ﬁrst two are the uncorrected FCI/cc-pVTZ and CAS(4/16)-ACPF/cc-

pV5Z potentials; the third one was obtained by substituting our best estimate De and re,

and adjusting β such that the best estimate ωe is matched. (The bn remain unchanged from

the CAS(4/16)-ACPF/cc-pV5Z values.) What this latter approaches in eﬀect assumes is

that the shape of the CAS(4/16)-ACPF/cc-pV5Z curve is fundamentally sound.

As expected, the unadjusted FCI/cc-pVTZ potential seriously underestimates the ﬁrst

three vibrational quanta because of the strong dependence of De, ωe, and re on the basis set

10

and the inclusion of inner-shell correlation. CAS(4/16)-ACPF/cc-pV5Z does so to a much

lesser extent. Our ‘best estimate’ potential, however, reproduces the fundamental (the only

transition known with some precision) essentially exactly, and is in good agreement with

experiment for the next two quanta. Since the VBM form of the potential does not take

into account long-distance behavior and the fourth quantum lies at 80% of the dissociation

energy, it is not surprising that the fourth quantum is seriously overestimated.

Finally, let us turn to the spectroscopic constants derived from our best potential (Table

5). Our best ωe is in perfect agreement with SM but substantially lower than the Bondybey

value. Our best ωexe is substantially smaller than both the Bondybey and SM values:

however, both of the latter were determined phenomenologically as [G(2) − 2G(1) − G(0)]/2

and therefore include contributions from higher-order anharmonicities. If we compute the

same quantity, we obtain perfect agreement with the SM value. While our rotation-vibration

coupling constant αe is in very good agreement with the SM calculations, it is substantially

larger than the Bondybey value. However, it should be noted that the Be2 potential is

so anharmonic that the series Bn = Be − αe(n + 1/2) + γe(n + 1/2)2 + δe(n + 1/2)3 + . . .

cannot be truncated after the linear term; from our best computed spectroscopic constants,

we obtain B0=0.6086 cm−1, in perfect agreement with Bondybey’s value of 0.609 cm−1 for

this observable quantity. In short, we argue that our computed re = 2.440 ˚A is more reliable

than the Bondybey value of 2.450 ˚A.

As a ﬁnal note, we point out that this revised reference geometry (re=2.440 ˚A) would not

have aﬀected our calculation of De materially, since the energy diﬀerence between R =2.44

and R = 2.45 ˚A with our best potential only amounts to 0.4 cm−1.

From an exhaustive basis set convergence study on the dissociation energy of the ground-

state Be2, we ﬁnd that the accepted experimental value needs to be revised upward to a best

estimate of 944 ±25 cm−1.

Individual contributions to this value include a valence-only

IV. CONCLUSIONS

11

FCI basis set limit of 872±15 cm−1, an inner-shell contribution of 76±10 cm−1, and rela-

tivistic corrections as small as −4 cm−1. The performance of single-reference methods for

this molecule is crucially dependent on their treatment of connected triple excitations; while

CCSD(T) underestimates binding in this molecule, the CC5SD(T) method performs surpris-

ingly well at a fraction of the cost of full CCSDT. The contribution of connected quadruple

excitations is small (80 cm−1) and fairly insensitive to the basis set. Accurate multireference

calculations require an active space which treats angular (2p,3p) correlation in a balanced

way; a full-valence CAS(4/8) reference does not satisfy this criterion. For the utmost accu-

racy, a CAS(4/16) reference including the (3s, 3p) orbitals is required, while for less accurate

work a CAS(4/4) reference is recommended. Our best computed spectroscopic observables

(expt. values in parameters) are G(1) − G(0)=223.7 (223.8), G(2) − G(1)=173.8 (169±3),

G(3) − G(2)=125.4 (122±3), and B0=0.6086 (0.609) cm−1. Our best computed spectro-

scopic constants represent substantial revisions from the experimentally derived values; in

particular, the bond length is 0.01 ˚A shorter than the accepted experimental value.

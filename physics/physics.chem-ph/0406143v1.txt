Atoms Hg and Pb and their compounds.

A way to account eﬃciently for the contribution from the correlations of valence and core elec-
trons in the framework of the Generalized Relativistic Eﬀective Core Potential (GRECP) method is
suggested. The “correlated” GRECPs (CGRECPs) are generated for the Hg and Pb atoms. Only
correlations for valence twelve and four electrons, correspondingly, should be treated explicitly in the
following calculations with these CGRECPs whereas innermore (core) electrons are excluded from
CGRECP calculations. Results of test atomic calculations with the correlated and conventional
GRECP versions are compared with the corresponding all-electron Dirac-Coulomb results. Com-
parative CGRECP and GRECP calculations of the ground state for the PbO molecule are carried
out.

INTRODUCTION.

Precise calculations of electronic structure of molecules are required in various ﬁelds of both basic research and
practical applications. To attain high accuracy, correlations not only for valence but also for core electrons often have
to be taken into account. It is demonstrated in papers [1, 2] for Hg and Pb that neglecting the correlations between
core and valence electrons (and higher order core-valence contributions accounting also for correlations between core
electrons) leads to signiﬁcant errors in calculating transition energies already between lowest-lying states. Let us call
below such correlations as “core correlations” for brevity. Unfortunately, the computational eﬀorts very fast grow with
increasing the number of correlated electrons if the two-electron correlation operator is explicitly used. Therefore, the
approximate methods which allow one to treat the core correlations by a simpliﬁed way are of practical interest.

The Relativistic Eﬀective Core Potential (RECP) method is widely used for calculations of molecules containing
heavy atoms [3] because it reduces drastically the computational cost at the integral generation, SCF and integral
transformation stages as compared to the all-electron four-component approach. It is demonstrated both theoretically
and computationally in our papers [1, 2, 4, 5, 6] that the RECP method can be used as a very accurate approximation
not only for SCF calculations but for subsequent correlated calculations as well. In a series of papers [4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11],
it is proposed to split a correlated calculation of a molecule containing heavy atoms into two computationally tractable
consequent calculations, in valence (molecular RECP calculation) and core (one-center restoration in cores) regions.
In the two-step calculation, the computational eﬀorts in correlating core and valence electrons will be roughly summed,
whereas the number of conﬁgurations in conventional Conﬁguration Interaction (CI) calculations grows as the product
of the core and valence excitations when they are treated simultaniously in an one-step calculation. In the present
paper, a method of accounting for the contribution from the core correlations with the help of the Generalized RECP
(GRECP) operator is suggested.

SCHEME OF “CORRELATED” GRECP GENERATION.

The GRECP method [4, 12] was chosen to take into account eﬀectively the contribution from the core correlations
because it allows one to reproduce very accurately electronic structure in the valence region whereas the inherent
limitations of radially-local RECPs in accuracy [4, 13] can be substantially stronger than the eﬀect of accounting for
the core correlations. To treat the core correlations (before their incorporating into GRECP), we have chosen the Fock
Space Relativistic Coupled Cluster method with Single and Double cluster amplitudes (FS RCC-SD) [14, 15] because it
has essential theoretical and computational advantages. This method is size-consistent that is, in particular, important
for the compounds of heavy elements having large number of core electrons. The ideology of the FS RCC method,
in which the part of correlations from lower sectors is “frozen” in the higher Fock space sectors, is especially suitable
for incorporation of the most important correlations of them into GRECP. Neglecting the higher cluster amplitudes
seems us reasonable because the core correlations give relatively small corrections to the properties determined mainly
by the valence electrons. At last, the atomic FS RCC-SD code [14, 15] is very eﬃcient because it fully exploits the
spherical symmetry of atoms.

The main steps of the scheme of generation of the GRECP which accounts for the core correlations (to which we

will further refer as to the “correlated” GRECP or CGRECP) are following:

1. For a considered atom, a set of occupied spinors is derived from an all-electron Dirac-Fock calculation [16] for
some closed shell state which is energetically close to the states which are of primary interest in calculations with
the constructed CGRECP. The unoccupied spinors are obtained with the help of some procedure for a basis set
generation (e.g., see [1, 2]). The Fock matrix and two-electron integrals are calculated in this basis set with all-
electron Dirac-Coulomb or Dirac-Coulomb-Breit Hamiltonian.

2. Two equivalent FS RCC-SD calculations are carried out with the same model spaces and schemes of calculation in
the Fock space, see [1, 2] for details of such calculations. Only valence electrons are correlated in calculation (V),
whereas both the valence and core electrons are correlated in calculation (A). The model space spinors should contain
the spinors, for which the GRECP components will be then constructed at step 5. We start from the above closed
shell state. Then, we add electrons to (or remove from) the model space spinors. As a result of the FS RCC-SD
calculations, a set of the single (ta
ij ) cluster amplitudes and ionization potentials (em) or electron
aﬃnities (ev) is obtained. The m and v indices run over the model space spinors occupied and unoccupied in the
starting closed shell state, correspondingly. The i, j indices in the cluster amplitudes run over the spinors occupied
in the above closed shell state and, additionally, include the v indices. The a, b indices in the cluster amplitudes run
over the spinors unoccupied in the above closed shell state and, additionally, include the m indices. If the correlations
with the electron in state i are not considered (e.g., in calculation (V)), we put the corresponding ta
ji and tab

cluster amplitudes to zero.

where φprev is the spinors obtained at the previous iteration. The derived spinors are then orthonormalized by the
Schmidt procedure. The Fock matrix and two-electron integrals are calculated in the obtained basis set. We use
∆em and ∆ev to modify the diagonal Fock matrix elements (Fmm and Fvv) only for calculation (V )

Fmm(V ) = F prev

where F prev(V ) is the Fock matrix derived at the previous iteration. We put the nondiagonal Fock matrix elements
for calculation (V) to zero. Then, we go to step 2.

5. The spinors and the corresponding Fock matrix elements from calculation (V) are used as the original spinors and
their one-electron energies at the CGRECP generation step employing the procedure of the GRECP generation
described in details in [4, 17, 18].

The generated CGRECP can be considered as basis-set-independent in practice if a large enough basis set is
generated at step 1.
It means that the errors due to incompleteness of the above basis set (distinctions in the
results obtained with the CGRECPs generated with diﬀerent basis sets at step 1) are expected to be signiﬁcantly
less important than the errors due to other limitations of the considered CGRECP approximation. Of course, a large
enough basis set should be used for calculations with the CGRECP when estimating its errors.

ATOMIC CALCULATIONS.

Correlation structure of the Hg and Pb atoms was studied precisely in papers [1, 2]. It can be seen from [1] that at
least 34 external electrons of Hg should be correlated if consistent agreement with experimental one-electron excitation
energies within 200 cm−1 is desired for low-lying states. Then, it was shown in [5] that the triple cluster amplitudes
for 12 external electrons of the mercury atom and 13 electrons of the mercury hydride molecule are required to obtain

3

accurate results. Moreover, the dipole-type polarization of the 5d shell of Hg is not negligible when considering
a chemical bond formation. This type of the polarization can not be taken into account in atomic calculations
with the codes employing the advantages of the spherical symmetry. Therefore, we describe the correlations with
the 4f, 5s, 5p shells of Hg by means of the CGRECP whereas the correlations for the 5d, 6s, 6p shells should be
taken into account explicitly in the following calculations with this CGRECP. For Pb, we include the correlations
with the 4s, 4p, 4d, 4f, 5s, 5p, 5d shells into the CGRECP. It is in agreement with chemical intuition that Hg is a
transition metal whereas the 5d shell in Pb is not so active chemically.
It should be noted that the core-valence
partitioning used for incorporating the correlation eﬀects into CGRECP diﬀers from the innercore-outercore-valence
partitioning [4, 12] used for GRECP generation. Therefore, those shells whose correlations were taken into account
at the CGRECP generation stage must be “frozen” in the following CGRECP calculations. The states used in
3/25d6
the FS RCC-SD calculations at step 2 of the CGRECP generation (“generator states”) are 5d4
5/2,
3/25d5
5d4
3/2 for Pb.
To check accuracy of the generated CGRECPs, we have carried out comparative RCC and Conﬁguration Interaction
(CI) calculations with the GRECP and CGRECP, in which the correlations were explicitly considered only for the
valence electrons. The obtained results are presented in tables I and II and they are also compared with the results
of the corresponding calculations (carried out by us earlier [1, 2]) employing all-electron Dirac-Coulomb Hamiltonian,
in which the correlations were taken into account for both the valence and core electrons. The contributions from the
core correlations to energies of transitions with excitation or ionization of a single electron are up to 1100 cm−1 for Hg
and 1000 cm−1 for Pb. One can also see that the CGRECPs allow one to reproduce the results of the corresponding
Dirac-Coulomb calculations with accuracy better than 310 cm−1 for Hg and 390 cm−1 for Pb that is on the level of
“chemical accuracy”. Similar precision can be expected in calculations of (at least) vertical excitation energies for
their compounds.

MOLECULAR CALCULATIONS.

Molecule PbO is of interest in connection with both ongoing and planned experiments on search for the electric
dipole moment of the electron on the excited a(1) [19] or B(1) [20] states. In particular, calculation [11] of the eﬀective
electric ﬁeld, Wd, seen by an unpaired electron is necessary for interpretation of the experimental results. Calculation
of spectroscopic properties can be useful to search for some better populating scheme of the working state. The aim
of the present calculations is to check accuracy and reliability of the CGRECP version used by us on the example of
the ground state of PbO where highly accurate and reliable experimental data are available.

We carried out 10-electron Spin-Orbit Direct CI (10e-SODCI) [21, 22] calculations of the potential curve for the
ground state of the PbO molecule (see [6, 23, 24] for the details of such calculations). The calculations were carried
out for 17 internuclear distances from 2.8 a.u. to 4.4 a.u. with interval of 0.1 a.u. Molecular spectroscopic constants
were calculated by the Dunham method in the Born-Oppenheimer approximation using the DUNHAM-SPECTR code
[25]. The core of the Pb atom was simulated with the help of the previous GRECP version from [18] and with the
CGRECP version generated in the present work. 22 electrons are explicitly considered in calculations with both the
GRECP and CGRECP (one should remember that the 5s, 5p, 5d pseudospinors of Pb must be “frozen” in calculations
with the CGRECP). In the present GRECP and CGRECP calculations of PbO, the 5s, 5p, 5d pseudospinors of Pb
were frozen with the help of the level-shift technique [4, 6]. No relativistic eﬀects were accounted for oxigen and,
besides, its 1s shell was frozen in the PbO calculations. Thus, only 4 electrons of Pb and 6 electrons of O were
explicitly correlated. The same basis set was used for the GRECP and CGRECP calculations. The obtained results
are presented in table III. One can see that both results are in reasonably good agreement with the experimental
data. Probably, the core correlations do not contribute signiﬁcantly to the calculated properties in this particular
case. Nevertheless, the error of the CGRECP results with respect to the experimental data is down to two times
lower than in the GRECP case (e.g., for the equilibrium distance Re). More precise calculations (with larger number
of reference conﬁgurations, lower selection threshold, for larger number of internuclear distances) are in progress.

atoms the model is build in a (3N − 3)-dimensional sub-
space, since for each x, y or z coordinates the dimension
parallel to the vector (1, 1, 1, ...) contains conformations
that are obtained by translation along the axis.

2) The scaling symmetry: the points lying on a half-
line starting at the origin result from multiplying the
coordinates of a given 3D conformation by an arbitrary
positive factor. It reﬂects the fact that the unit length
in our system can be arbitrarily deﬁned.

The model however fails to incorporate the all im-
portant rotation symmetry, this is due to the fact that
combinatorial approaches like ours apply mostly to lin-
ear systems. This greatly complicates the embbeding of
3D conformations.

To circumvent this problem, the approach we explore
in the present communication is how conformations can
be embedded in CS starting from its elementary building
blocks, and the most elementary component 3D struc-
ture is a simplex2. Many structural patterns in molecu-
lar systems can be decomposed into simplexes [3].

As we shall see below embedding in CS just a simplex
is not simple, but this approach leads us to study a set of
combinatorial structures that oﬀer, beyond the embed-
ding problem, the interesting possibility of encoding the
dynamical states of a molecular system.

Abstract— A combinatorial model of molecular
conformational space that was previously devel-
opped [1], had the drawback that structures could
not be properly embedded beacause it lacked ex-
plicit rotational symmetry. The problem can be
circumvented by sorting the elementary 3D com-
ponents of a molecular system into a ﬁnite set of
classes that can be separately embedded. This
also opens up the possibility of encoding the dy-
namical states into a graph structure.

Keywords— Molecular conformational space,
hyperplane arrangement, face lattice, molecular
dynamics

I. Introduction

In a previous paper [1] it was presented a combinato-
rial model of molecular confomational space (thereafter
refered as CS), it was shown that it could be described
with a fair degree of accuracy by a central arrangement of
hyperplanes1 that partitions the space into a set of cells.
The arrangement was deﬁned such that, for a molecule
of N atoms, the 3-dimensional (3D) conformations in
a cell all have the same dominance sign vector:
for a
given vector p ǫ RN there is an associated dominance sign
vector D(p) = (d12, d13, ..., dp−2,p, dp−1,p) whose compo-
nents are deﬁned as follows

+ pi < pj
pi = pj
0
− pi > pj

dij = 




1 ≤ i < j ≤ N

(1)

There is a set of three dominance sign vectors per 3D
conformation one for each coordinate: the partition is
actually a product of three partitions [1].

A central concept for the combinatorial study of an
hyperplane arrangement is the face lattice poset [2]: the
cells in the induced decomposition of R3N −3 ordered by
inclusion.
It is this hierarchical structure that enables
us to manage the sheer complexity of CS since with the
simple codes (1) we can encompass from broad regions
down to single cells.

The model takes into account two basic symmetries

of CS:

ented as to make the graph acyclic. If we assume that v1 lies above

the plane of the ﬁgure, it corresponds to a right-handed simplex.

1) The translation symmetry: for a molecule with N

From the simplex of Fig. 1 we deﬁne the following

1the term central means that all the hyperplanes pass through the origin.
2A three-dimensional polytope with four vertices.

set of vectors and their associated central planes:

eij = vi − vj, E 0

ij(x) = {x ǫ R3 : eij.x = 0}

(2)

for 1 ≤ i < j ≤ 4. These six planes generate a partition
of 3D space into 24 cells [4] (see Fig. 2): each plane
divides the space into positive and negative hemispaces
and a zero space in between

E +
ij (x) = {x ǫ R3 : eij.x > 0} and
−
ij (x) = {x ǫ R3 : eij.x < 0}
E

(3)

a 3D cell results from the intersection of six hemispaces,
thus it can be unambiguously characterized by the signs
of these six hemispaces (Fig. 2).

It is easy to see that the dominance sign vectors for
an arbitrary 3D-reference system centered at the origin
can be obtained from this partition: consider for instance
the z-axis and suppose that z.e12 > 0, this means that z
is in a cell where the e12 component of the sign vector is
+, which in turn implies that v1z > v2z.

Thus the dominance sign vector for each coordinate
will be the sign vector of the cell that contains its positive
semi-axis.

Fig. 2. Tope graph of the partition (2), each node corresponds to
a 3D cell and the edges represent the planes separating the cells.

For each node the corresponding sign vector is annotated on the

right.

Lower dimensional cells occur for vectors that lie in
one or more of the planes Eij, in that case the correspond-
ing components of the sign vector are zero.

The 1-dimensional (1D) cells are rays starting at the

origin and running parallel to the vectors

f123 = e12 ∧ e23, f124 = e12 ∧ e24, f134 = e13 ∧ e34,
f234 = e23 ∧ e34, f12,34 = e12 ∧ e34, f13,24 = e13 ∧ e24,
f14,23 = e14 ∧ e23

(4)

the ﬁrst four are the vectors perpendicular to the faces
of the simplex, the last three are perpendicular to pairs
of non-adjacent edges. As in (2) they have a set of asso-
ciated central planes

The zeros in the matrix correspond to the planes that
intersect the corresponding 1D cell, this means that the
cells encoded by f123 and f12,34, for instance, are sour-
rounded by six and four 3D cells respectively.

The zeros in the sign vector of lower dimensional cells
can be seen as a sort of wildcard: they match the sign
vectors of all the adjacent cells. The converse is also true:
a sign vector from a 3D cell can be obtained by adding
up the sign vectors from the adjacent lower dimensional
cells [4]. As an example, for the lower left cell of Fig. 2
we have (−−−+++) = (−00++0)+(−−00++)+(−−
−000) = −SIGN (f134) + SIGN (f14,23) − SIGN (f234).

There is still another set of sign vectors that will be
most useful in characterizing the geometric properties of
simplexes: these are the signs of the scalar products of
the vectors (2) and (4) between them.

Let us assume that we have a particular right-handed

simplex whose set of signs is

III. Embedding a simplex

The set of sign vectors (7a) refers mostly to the angles
between adjacent edges while (7b) are mostly related to
dihedral angles between contiguous faces: +, 0 and −
are for acute, right and obtuse angles respectively. Thus
(7) gives us a rough outline of the geometry of a simplex,
and allows a classiﬁcation of simplexes.

Next we are going to proceed to embed our simplex
in CS for the particular case where the z-axis runs par-
alell to f123. The reason for this special choice will be
explained below.

Fig. 3. View from above of F 0
123, the plane appears divided in a
number of sectors, separating sectors are rays running along vectors

whose denomination appears at the outer extreme, vector names
bearing a ′ are projections: x′ = x − f123(x.f123)/kf123k. Rays or-
thogonal to vectors e′
ij always correspond to intersections with the
planes E 0
ij. In the inner layer each sector harbors its corresponding
sign vector, in the outer layer are the sign vectors corresponding to

the 1D cells. Sign vectors should be read in the outward direction.

The x and y axis are depicted in a random position.

From Fig. 3 we can see that F 0

123 has been parti-
tioned into 24 cells, which are delimited by lines along
the projections of vectors eij and from the intersections
ij (2): thus each projected e′
with planes E 0
ij vector is per-
pendicular to the intersection of the corresponding E 0
ij
and it divides the plane into two signed moities as in (2)
and (3), so the sign vector associated with each cell in
Fig. 3 becomes obvious, by construction they are the
dominance sign vectors associated to a coordinate axis
that is in the cell.
Also by construction, the sixth cell
after/before the one under consideration is orthogonal to
it. Thus by rotating the x and y axis around z in Fig. 3

we can scan the complete set of dominance sign vectors
that arise for this particular situation. Before proceeding
further let us explain how Fig. 3 can be obtained from
(6) and (7).

By construction, see Fig. 1 and (4), e12, e13 and e23
are in circular counter-clockwise order, with the last two
vectors in the negative hemispaces of e12 (7a) and f124
(6). For the remaining projections:

e′
14) e14 lies above F 0

123 (6), by (7b) the same is true
of f134 and f14,23, as e14 is contained in the plane per-
pendicular to these vectors e′
14 will be located inside the
sector determined by e13 and e23.

e′
24) e24 is above F 0

123 (6) as well as f124 and f234
(7b), using the same argument as above e14 will be lo-
cated inside the sector determined by -e12 and e23.

e′
34) e34 lies in the − − −+ sector relative to e12, e13
′.

e23 and e24 (7a), this squeezes e′

34 between E

Fig. 4. Tope graph of the partition (4) showing the sign vectors
of 1D cells. As in Fig. 2 the graph is planar, sign vectors of 3D

cells can be obtained by adding the sign vectors around each node.

Notice that the columns in (6), or their centrally symmetric sign
vectors, all correspond to sign vectors above.

The circular order of the projected vectors in Fig. 3
can be obtained from the signs of the ﬁrst row in (7b):
one can see from Fig. 3 that the shortest path between
e12 and e′
34 runs clokwise, while the shortest path from
e23 to e′
34 runs counterclockwise. This is simply
due to the fact that e23, e24 and e34, for instance, are
contained in F 0
234 and the angle between e23 and e34 can
not exceed 2π, thus their circular order in the projection
depends on wether f234 lies above or below F 0

24 and e′

123.

To obtain the sign vector encoding the circular order
in the plane perpendicular to a vector in general posi-
tion, it suﬃces to look wether the given vector is in the

positive or negative hemispace relative to the planes (5).
Thus the central arrangement generated by (4) parti-
tions the space in 32 cells that are represented by the
tope graph of Fig.4.

This settles the problem of the circular ordering of
the projected vectors which is completely determined by
(6).

Last but not least, it is indispensable for the correct
simultaneous allocation of the x and y dominance sign
vectors, to determine the relative positions in the circu-
lar ordering between the e′
ijs and the intersections of the
E 0
ijs.

As this is not a linear problem in some cases it can
only be partially resolved by (7). Ambiguities can arise
when building a projection, for instance: if in the exam-
ple of Fig. 3 e′
24 and the intersection of E 0
34 both fell in
the same sector. In that case we would have to split the
diagram into two alternative ones.

V. The enumeration of minimal vectors

In the diagram from Fig. 3 the dominance sign vector

associated with the {x, y, z} reference frame is

((+ − − − −+), (+ + − − −−), (00 + 0 + +)),

one can notice that it is squeezed between

((+ − − − −+), (+ + 0 − −−), (00 + 0 + +)) and
((+ − − − −+), (+0 − − − −), (00 + 0 + +)).

The importance of this diagram is that it enumer-
ates all the lower dimensional 2D cells associated with
the sign vector (00 + 0 + +), and since the rows of (6)
are all the 1D cells in the partition constructing a dia-
gram like the one in Fig. 3 for every row in (6) allows
us to enumerate all the minimal vectors in our system
(those bearing a maximum number of zeros), all other
sign vectors being combinations of them.

VI. The general embedding problem

In molecular dynamics simulations atoms are rep-
resented by pointlike structures surrounded by a force
ﬁeld, thus any four atoms in a molecular structure can
form a simplex.
If an order relation has been deﬁned
between the atoms of the system, then vectors (2) and
(5) can be deﬁned too for every simplex with the node
numbers of Fig. 1 representing the order of the atoms.

Some of the vectors (2) and (5) are shared between
simplexes through common edges and faces, as a conse-
quence orienting a simplex restricts the range of avail-

able orientations in the other simplexes. Embedding a
3D conformation in CS can be done with this simple
algorithm:

1) take a set of connected simplexes3 such that every
pair of atoms in the structure is at least in one simplex,
2) choose a simplex with a non empty set of available

sign vectors, otherwise terminate the procedure,

3) select one orientation and restrict the available ori-
entations in the other simplexes to the ones compatible
with this choice. Repeat step 2.

VII. Conclusion

The two main results of this communication are
1) simplexes can be put into a number of discrete
classes, not taking into account handedness we have: 258
and 816 sets for (7a) and (7b) respectively, with both
combined we have a total of 3936 classes.

2) these classes are related to cells in CS, thus relat-
ing the binary sets (7) in a molecular conformation to
3D coordinates.

Embedding just one 3D conformation is not an inter-
esting issue, what really matters is embedding the vol-
ume occupied by a molecular system.

Beyond the embedding problem the results above of-
fer the possibility of building a structure encoding the
dynamical states of a molecule. This can be seen by an-
alyzing the dynamical activity of all simplexes in a typ-
ical molecular dynamics simulation like the one studied
in [5], we ﬁnd that

1) 90% of the simplexes evolve within less than 20

classes,

2) 0.4% remain in a single class for the duration of
the simulation, form a connected set and comprise 95%
of the dominance relations (1),

3) the most dynamically active simplex spans a range

of 171 classes, slightly less than 2% of the total.

A connected set of simplexes can obviously be rep-
resented by a graph, where each node can be split into
a number of classes (7): its dynamical states. The con-
nectivity between the sets (7) is an issue than has not
been explored in this paper, but its determination will al-
low the connexion between dynamical states in adjacent
nodes thus generating the derived graph of the molecular
system dynamical states.

This graph is a subject for further research.

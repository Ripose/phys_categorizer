Abstract

We propose a method, based on a Generalized Heisenberg Algebra
(GHA), to reproduce the anharmonic spectrum of diatomic molecules.
The theoretical spectrum generated by GHA allows us to ﬁt the ex-
perimental data and to obtain the dissociation energy for the carbon
monoxide molecule. Our outcomes are more accurate than the stan-
dard models used to study molecular vibrations, namely the Morse
and the q-oscillator models and comparable to the perturbed Morse
model proposed by Huﬀaker [1], for the ﬁrst experimental levels. The
dissociation energy obtained here is more accurate than all previous
models.

Keywords: molecular vibrational spectrum; Heisenberg algebra; quantum-
group.

1 Introduction

Vibrational spectroscopy has a fundamental role in molecular physics and its
applications extend to other ﬁelds like astronomy [2], biology [3] and earth
and environmental sciences [4]. Vibrational molecular analysis provides im-
portant informations on the structure of the molecules. Recently, the de-
velopment of the powerful experimental techniques which allow the study of
highly excited vibrational states [5, 6]. In Born-Oppenheimer approximation,
electronic, rotational and vibrational quantum states [3] can be considered
separately and molecular vibrations can are approximately described by the
harmonic oscillator [7]. However, this model fails to describe the highest
molecular vibrational modes and consequently to provide the correct disso-
ciation energies. One of the ﬁrst models that introduce a correction in the
harmonic term, was proposed by Morse [8]. In the Morse model the harmonic
potential is replaced, in the Schroedinger Equation (SE), by the the so-called
Morse potential. This model can be solved analytically and reproduces faith-
fully the experimental vibrational levels of diatomic molecules, providing a
spectrum with an upper bound. In order to obtain better ﬁttings with the
experimental data, several ab initio methods, based on the use of Morse-like,
Kratzer-like or modiﬁed versions of these or other potential functions have
been used to study molecular systems [9, 10, 11, 12]. There is also several ab
initio and algebraic methods to calculate dissociation energies [13, 14].

Despite the ab initio methods being able to obtain good approximations
for spectra of many molecules, some authors have pointed out some limita-
tions to these. Angelova et al. [15], note that the Morse potential contains
just quadratic corrections and one needs to use the empirical Dunham expan-
sion to ﬁt the highest vibrational energies. Iachello and Levine [16], remark
that the solution of the SE is very diﬃcult in the case of two- and three- di-
mensions and, at this point, algebraic methods could bring some advantage.
Problems related to the dissociation energy estimation and an algebraic en-
ergy method to calculate it, were described by Sun et al.[17]. Besides the
facts above mentioned, there are some molecules whose potentials deviate
strongly from Morse-like potentials [18].

The algebraic approach to study molecular vibrational and rotational
spectra was pioneered by F. Iachello [19]. The method has been proved useful
for calculating accurately highly excited vibrational levels and describing the
whole spectrum of complex molecules, while maintaining its simplicity, in
cases where the use of ab initio methods are not feasible in practice [20,

2

21]. The method has been used to study the rotational and the vibrational
spectrum of molecules [5, 22]. A brief review of the Lie algebraic method in
molecular and other systems can be seen in reference [23].

Deformed Heisenberg Algebras (or q-oscillators) have attracted consider-
able attention since they have been proposed [26, 24, 25], due both to math-
ematical interest and to their possible physical applications [27] (see ref. [28]
for a review). They are non-trivial generalizations of the Heisenberg Alge-
bra having as generators ladder operators and the number operator. These
algebras are characterized by the deformation parameter q. It is interesting
to notice that for some set of values of the q-deformation parameter, namely
0 < q < 1, the energy spectrum associated with the Deformed Heisenberg
Algebras presents an upper bound, a situation which is similar to the typical
spectrum of a composite particle [29]. This property suggests that Deformed
Heisenberg Algebras might be a useful tool to investigate the spectrum of
composite particles. Diatomic molecules are an important example of com-
posite particles. Thus, deformed algebra approach has been used to study
the molecular spectrum of the diatomic molecules [15, 30, 31, 32] as an al-
ternative method to the usual ab initio approaches. Within this formalism
q-oscillators are used as a model of anharmonic oscillators, whose spectrum
is similar to the molecular vibrational spectrum. Advantages of this method
are that it has few parameters, analytical expressions and ﬁts well the ﬁrst
experimental levels. However, as it will become clear later, the model does
not provide the correct dissociation energy for the CO molecule, for example,
i.e, it fails to ﬁt the highest vibrational levels.

Possible physical interpretations of the q-oscillator algebras, have been
discussed in many works. For example, in molecular physics, the potential
associated to the q-oscillator was studied by several authors [33, 34, 35]. In
many-body theory, a possible interpretation of the q parameter was given by
Sviratcheva et al. [36].

Recently, a Generalized Heisenberg Algebra (GHA), where the commuta-
tion relations among the operators depend on a characteristic function of the
generalized number operator, has been proposed [26]. If the characteristic
function is linear, with slope q2, the algebra correspond to the q-oscillator
algebra. In the present work we introduce and implement a nonlinear GHA
which is able to describe typical features of the vibrational molecular spec-
trum of the carbon monoxide molecule. The spectrum generated by this
nonlinear GHA (nl-GHA) allows us to ﬁt the 20 ﬁrst vibrational transitions
and to obtain the correct dissociation energy for the CO molecule, providing

3

better global results than the methods above mentioned.

The paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we discuss the solution
of the Schroedinger Equation (SE) with Morse potential . In section 3 we
introduce the GHA method. In section 4 we apply our GHA model to the
CO molecule. Finally, section 5 is devoted to discussions and conclusions.

2 Morse Potential for Diatomic Molecules:

Vibrational Levels

Let us now turn our attention to one of the most familiar quantum descrip-
tion of diatomic molecules. For low energy levels, the molecular potential can
be approximated by the harmonic potential, whereas for high energy this ap-
proximation breaks down. In fact, the higher vibrational transitions exhibits
a certain degree of anharmonicity. Thus, to take into account anharmonic
terms and rotational eﬀects, nonlinear terms must be introduced besides the
harmonic one in the energy expression [3]:

Eν,J =

= Yl,m (cid:18)

ν +

Xl,m

l

2 (cid:19)

[J(J + 1)]m ,

(1)

where ν and J are the vibrational and the rotational quantum numbers,
respectively. The above expression was obtained by Dunhan, using the WKB
method [1].

An analytical solution for the SE, which corresponds to the second order
truncation of the equation (1) with J0 = 0, was obtained by Morse [8] using
the so-called Morse potential (see Figure 1):

V (r) = De−2a(r−r0) − 2De−a(r−r0),

(2)

where a is a characteristic constant of each molecule, r is the nuclear distance,
r0 is the equilibrium position and D is the dissociation energy. The solution
of the SE for this potential gives the following expression for the vibrational
energy

ǫn = −D + hω[(ν +

) − χe(ν +

)2], (ν = 0, 1, 2, ...,

),

where χe is a positive constant called the anharmonicity coeﬃcient, ω is the
fundamental frequency, ν is the vibrational quantum number and k = 1
> 1.

The anharmonicity coeﬃcient is related to the dissociation energy:

χe =

hω

.

The energy levels obtained agree reasonably well with experimental data
for many molecules [3]. The maximum allowed value for n in equation (3) is
such that the SE solution remains ﬁnite. One can also show that this value
is given by

1
2χe
Hence, there is maximum energy value ǫνmax beyond which the system is not
bounded.

.

In order to improve the Morse results, several perturbative methods,
based on the Morse or other analytical or numerical potential, have been
proposed. Huﬀaker [1], used a perturbed Morse model to calculate the ﬁrst
terms of the Dunhan expansion (1) for the CO molecule. He used a potential
given by following expression:

V (r) = Ve[(1 − e−aq)2 + b4(1 − e−aq)4.
+b5(1 − e−aq)5 + . . .)]

Using 28 spectral lines of the CO molecule [37], he calculated 8 parameters of
the potential curve given by equation (6). This model is good when compared
with the model obtained via RKR method by Mantz et al. [37]. If one ignore
the rotational degree of freedom (l = 0), model has 7 parameters.

3 The Generalized Heisenberg Algebra

In [26] Curado e Rego-Monteiro proposed an algebra called GHA which is
generated by three operators J0, A and A†, satisfying the following relations:

(6)

(7)
(8)
(9)

(cid:2)
where † is the Hermitian conjugate, (A†)† = A, J †
0 = J0 and f (J0) is an
analytical function of J0, called the characteristic function. Assuming the

(cid:3)

J0 A† = A† f (J0),
A J0 = f (J0) A,

A, A†

= f (J0) − J0,

existence of a vacuum state represented by |0i (A|0i ≡ 0), it can be shown
that

J0 |m − 1i = f m−1(ǫ0) |m − 1i, m = 1, 2...,
A† |m − 1i = Mm−1 |mi,

A |mi = Mm−1 |m − 1i,

where M 2
m−1 = f m(ǫ0) − ǫ0, ǫ0 is the lowest J0 eigenvalue and f m(ǫ0) is the
m-th iteration of the function f . This algebra describes a class of Heisenberg-
like algebras of quantum systems, having energy eigenvalues given by

ǫn = f (ǫn−1),

where ǫn and ǫn−1 are two successive eigenvalues and are related with the
energy for the system [38]. Therefore, the J0 eigenvalues can be obtained
iteratively and they can be upper bounded or not, depending on the chrac-
teristic function, the values of the function parameters and the initial value
ǫ0. For each kind of function, the values of teh parameters and the initial
values determine the existence or not of the ﬁxed points, ǫ⋆ = f (ǫ⋆) [39], and
their stability. As a consequence, diﬀerent spectra are obtained for diﬀerent
functions and the eigenvalues behavior can be analyzed using dynamical sys-
tems techniques. For the linear case, f (J0) = q J0 + s, the equations (7-9)
become

(cid:3)

= (q − 1) J0 + s,

where [a, b]q ≡ ab − q ba is the q-commutation of the operators a and b.
Equations (14-16) describe the one-parameter GHA studied in [26] and can
be mapped into the q-oscillator algebra. If q = 1, the standard Heisenberg
algebra is recovered.

A graphical analysis of the functions f (ǫ) = qǫ + s and y = ǫ is shown
in Figure 2. The intersection between the two lines is identiﬁed as the ﬁxed
point of the recurrence equation ǫn = qǫn−1 + s. The most interesting cases
are obtained for 0 < q < 1 and ǫ0 < s
1−q , as under these conditions the energy
spectrum has an upper bound ǫ∗ = s
1−q .

6

This behavior is similar to the energy spectrum of bounded systems,
for instance diatomic molecules, and Dq ≡ ǫ∗ − ǫ0 can be related to the
dissociation energy of the system. This interesting result enable us to perform
a phenomenological investigation of bounded systems, such as a diatomic
molecule, via GHA. This approach have been performed by several authors
[28, 15].

4 GHA and Vibrational Molecular Spectrum

4.1 Linear case - (q-oscillator)

We will now study the spectrum generated by the linear GHA mentioned
above, which correspond to the q-oscillator algebra. To study the vibra-
tional spectrum of diatomic molecules via GHA formalism, we use a result
developed in [39, 40]. Let us start with the general Hamiltonian

H = ~ω(c1AA† + c2A†A + c3),

where A and A† obey the relations (7-9) and c1, c2 and c3 are real numbers.
Choosing c1 = c2 = 1 and c3 = 0, and using the equations (10-12) we get [39]

Therefore, for the linear case f (J0) = qJ0 + s (q < 1) we have:

H = ~ω (f (J0) + J0 − 2ǫ0) .

H = ~ω ((q + 1)J0 + s − 2ǫ0) .

Applying the Hamiltonian (19) on the eigenstate |νi of J0 (with ~ = 1), we
obtain H|νi = Eν|νi, where the energy eigenvalues are given by

Eν = ω[(q + 1)f ν(ǫ0) + s − 2ǫ0],

where f ν(ǫ0) = qνǫ0 + s qν −1

q−1 . After some algebra we obtain

Eν = ω

(cid:1)

with Lq = 1+q
q1/2

1−q − ǫ0) = 2(ǫ∗ − ǫ0).
The maximum energy (ν → ∞) for this system is given by E∞ = ωMq =

q1/2 (ǫ0 − ǫ∗) and Mq = 2( s

ǫ0 − s
1−q
(cid:16)

= 1+q

(cid:17)

2ω(ǫ∗ − ǫ0), and the dissociation energy (E∞ − E0) is then

(17)

(18)

(19)

(20)

(21)

(22)

Dq = ω(1 + q)(ǫ∗ − ǫ0).

7

The q−parameter can be interpreted as being related to the anharmonic-

ity constant, χe = − 1

2 τ , where q = eτ [35].

We will now apply the above results to the carbon monoxide molecule
spectrum and compare it with both experimental data and the spectra ob-
tained by (...trhoug) using the Morse, the perturbed Morse and the q-oscillator
models. We used the data provided by the HITRAN database [41] and chose
the lines in which the molecules are in the electronic fundamental state. Also,
we selected the lines whose rotational quantum numbers are zero. Thus, there
remained the spectral lines which represent the ﬁrst 21 pure vibrational tran-
sitions of the CO molecule.

In order to ﬁt the parameters (q and ǫ0) to the experimental data, note
that the logarithm of the diﬀerence between two successive levels of the
equation (21), as a function of ν, is a straight line with slope ln q. Taking the
logarithm of the diﬀerence between two successive data points, we obtain the
value of q by evaluating the slope of the curve after a linear regression. The
ﬁtted parameters are shown in table (1). The linear GHA spectrum agrees
well with the experimental data (see table (3) and ﬁgure (3)) mainly in the
case of the 20 ﬁrst vibrational transitions. However, the D value calculated
by equation (22) deviate strongly from the experimental value as can be
seen in table (2). This means that, although the q-oscillator relative errors
(∆E =
) are smaller than the relatives error obtained by Morse
(cid:12)
model, for most of the 20 ﬁrst vibrational transition (ﬁgure (3)), the approach
(cid:12)
(cid:12)
based on the q-oscillator is not able to ﬁt higher frequency vibrational levels.

4.2 Nonlinear case

As we seen above, the linear GHA (i.e. the q-oscillator), is a good model
only for the ﬁrst levels. In order to ﬁt the energy levels and to obtain the
correct dissociation energy we were led to use a nonlinear functional f (x) in
GHA (7-9). We found that by using the functional

f (x) = p x4 + q x + 1,

(23)

it is possible to obtain a good ﬁt with the experimental data and the correct
dissociation energy. Due its nonlinearity, the spectrum generated by this
nonlinear GHA does not have an analytical closed expression like equation
(21). In this case the spectrum can only be calculated numerically.

8

For the sake of simplicity, we start from the Hamiltonian

H = ~w(A†A + ǫ0) = ~wJ0,

(24)

which is derived from Hamiltonian (17) with c1 = 0, c2 = 1 and c3 = ǫ0.
Replacing f (J0) given by equation (23) in relations (7-9) and applying H on
the eigenstates of J0 (with ~ = 1) we obtain
Eν = wf ν(ǫ0),

(25)

where f ν = ǫν is given by:

ǫn+1 = pǫ4

n + qǫn + 1.

(26)

(27)

We use the values generated by equation (25) with f ν(ǫ0) given by equation
(26) in order to ﬁt the q, p and ǫ0 parameters with the experimental data.
The dissociation energy is given by

DGHA = E∞ − E0 = w(ǫ∗ − ǫ0),

where ǫ∗ is the stable ﬁxed point of the recurrence equation (26).

The ﬁtted parameters are shown in table (1). The dissociation energy
are shown in table (2). In table (3) we compare the energy levels obtained
with the diﬀerent models referred in this work with experimental data. The
relative errors are shown in the ﬁgure (3). We can see that the nonlin-
ear GHA with the functional (23) provides better ﬁttings with experimental
data than both q-oscillator and Morse models and it is comparable to the
Huﬀaker model [1]. Furthermore, nonlinear GHA provides a more accurate
dissociation energy when compared with that obtained in all other methods.
This results show that our model is a good method of obtaining the higher
anharmonic energy levels of the CO molecule.

As the p parameter is very small (table (1)), if ǫ0 is also small, the ﬁrst it-
erations of the equation (26) are dominated by the linear term. The nonlinear
term becomes relevant as the number of iterations increase. The diﬀerence
between two successive energy levels decreases up to zero as the function
(26) is iterated. Because the p parameter is negative, the diﬀerence between
two successive energy levels tends to zero. Thus, the nonlinear term ﬂats the
energy curve faster than in the pure linear and the perturbed Morse cases
but slightly slower than the Morse Model, as we can see in the ﬁgure (4).

We would like to stress that besides these accurate ﬁttings, the nonlinear
GHA give us an extremely simple way to estimate higher transitions of the
CO. We should just iterate equation (26) up to the required level.

5 Conclusion and Perspectives

In this work we have proposed a method based on GHA to reproduce the
vibrational molecular spectrum of diatomic molecules. For the CO molecule,
we have shown that the previous method based on the q-oscillator algebra
(linear GHA) reproduce the vibrational molecular spectrum for the 20 ﬁrst
vibrational transitions of the CO molecule, but it does not provide the correct
dissociation energy, i.e., this model fails when describing higher vibrational
levels. Using a nonlinear functional (4 − th order) in the GHA we were able
to ﬁt the experimental energy levels and to calculate the dissociation energy
for the CO molecule with good accuracy. For this molecule the nonlinear
GHA has provided better global results than the usual Morse and perturbed
Morse models, and q-oscillator model. This work shows that GHA can be
used as a phenomenological simple tool to study composite particles.

GHA produces diﬀerent spectra for diﬀerent characteristic functions. The
GHA spectrum could be related to deformations in harmonic potential. In-
deed, this algebra could reproduce a variety of spectra once we are able to
ﬁnd the appropriate characteristic function. Consequently, this algebra could
be used to study other molecules, simply choosing the appropriate charac-
teristic function. In an even more general fashion, de Souza et al. [42] have
constructed a more general structure that depends on two functional. This
new algebraic structure can reproduce a even greater variety of the spectrum
behavior, allowing us to work with two quantum numbers.

We have introduced a new method which is a generalization of former al-
gebraic methods. The method was tested for the CO molecule and was able
to ﬁt accurately the experimental data of the 20 ﬁrst transitions, to predict
the unknown levels, and to calculate the correct dissociation energy. The
results obtained in this work motivate us to explore deeper the relation be-
tween the GHA and molecular systems. This investigations may include: 1)
the study of the relation between the functional parameters and the molec-
ular parameters; 2) the investigation of the potential curve underling the
GHA; 3) the account of electronic and rotational states.

Figure 4: Normalized and shifted energy spectrum generated by the Morse
(⋆), q-oscillator ((cid:3)) and nonlinear GHA (·) models, perturbe Morse (⋄) and

ation energy value. We can see that the dissociation energy of the nonlinear
GHA lies on the experimental dissociation energy (dashed curve) while the
q-oscillator and Morse spectrum are respectively above and below dissocia-
tion energy line. Inset ﬁgure shows in detail the Morse and the nonlinear
GHA energy curves close to dissociation energy line. Note that the Morse
curve ﬂats before reaching the experimental dissociation energy while the

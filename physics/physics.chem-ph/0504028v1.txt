We apply non-local density functional formalism to describe an equilibrium distribution of the
water-like ﬂuid in the asymmetric nanoscale junction presenting an atomic force microscope (AFM)
tip dwelling above an arbitrary surface. The hydrogen bonding dominating in intermolecular at-
traction is modeled as a square well potential with two adjustable parameters (energy and length)
characterizing well’s depth and width. A water meniscus formed inside nanoscale junction is explic-
itly described for diﬀerent humidity. Furthermore, we suggest a simple approach using polymolecular
adsorption isotherms for the evaluation of an energetic parameter characterizing ﬂuid (water) attrac-
tion to substrate. This model can be easily generalized for more complex geometries and eﬀective
intermolecular potentials. Our study establishes a framework for the density functional description
of ﬂuid with orientational anisotropy induced by the non-uniform external electric ﬁeld.

INTRODUCTION

An equilibrium behavior of a ﬂuid near geometrically
nonuniform solid surfaces exhibits various peculiarities
related to conﬁnement and spatially varying external po-
tentials. A quantitative understanding of water conden-
sation phenomena in proximity of nano-asperities un-
der ambient humidity is important for diﬀerent areas
of research including scanning probe microscopy (SPM),
nano-patterning, adhesion and friction at macro- and
nanoscale. Speciﬁcally, the formation of liquid ﬁlms and
bridges near an asperity of sub-micro- or nano-scale cur-
vature needs to be adequately described.

An importance of the water condensation phenomenon
from ambient atmosphere into nanoscale junction formed
by AFM tip dwelling above surface has been recognized
in a number of works.1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 The formation of
the water meniscus aﬀects strongly the force-distance
measurements and AFM imaging resolution,1,2 provides
nanoscale electrochemical cell for SPM oxidation of semi-
conductors and metals,3,4 serves as ink transport chan-
nel for dip-pen nanolithography5,6 and plays an essential
role in AFM-assisted electrostatic nanolithography (AF-
MEN) of thin polymeric ﬁlms.7,8,9,10

Direct experimental observations of meniscus forma-
tion in the AFM tip - surface junction are complicated
due to nanometer-scale size of the region of interest.
There are no optical tools available for this purpose due
to the wavelength limitation.
Indirect estimations of
the meniscus’s size can be made using SPM oxidation,3
noncontact AFM imaging11,12 and substrate’s dissolu-
tion in water.13 Several theoretical estimations of the
meniscus size and shape based on the macroscopic Kelvin
equation14,15 and molecular level grand canonical Monte
Carlo simulations16,17,18 have been performed. A macro-
scopic phenomenological approach based on the modiﬁ-
cations of the Kelvin equation has been suggested to de-
scribe water attracted to biased AFM tip.12 The model
misses molecular level understanding, and is not appli-

cable for the systems conﬁned to the several molecular
diameters19,20 typical for AFM tip-substrate separation.
Arguably, the approaches based on the Kelvin equation
do not take into account strongly adsorbed layers, and
neglect the density oscillations near conﬁning surfaces.20
There is no molecular-level model describing the eﬀects
of external electric ﬁeld to the best of our knowledge.

The goal of this work is to develop a versatile de-
scription of the water condensation in proximity of a
nanoscale asperity and investigate the inﬂuence of spa-
tially non-uniform external electric ﬁeld, with a focus
on AFM nanolithography. Here we concern with the
case of isotropic ﬂuid conﬁned in asymmetric nanojunc-
tion in the absence of the electric ﬁeld to develop a ba-
sic framework for the case of ﬁeld-induced orientational
anisotropy.

Typical molecular approaches, applicable to the prob-
lem of our interest, include computer simulations of the
Monte Carlo21 and molecular dynamics22 types, and a
density functional theory (DFT).23,24 A grand canonical
Monte Carlo simulation of water condensation in the con-
text of the dip-pen nanolithography has been reported in
a series of works by Jang et.al.16,17,18 including clariﬁ-
cation of ﬂuctuations inﬂuence on the meniscus width.
The eﬀects of relative humidity, AFM tip curvative, tip
and substrate wetting properties on the meniscus size and
capillary force have been studied.

Unlike other studies, our study concerns with DFT ap-
proach to model real systems in which the ﬂuctuations
of meniscus’s width, as established in,16 are not signiﬁ-
cant. A mean ﬁeld character of the DFT is appropriate
since the ﬂuid is considered far from the critical point.
Menisci instabilities related to the tip-substrate distance
variations dependent on the AFM lever thermal ﬂuctu-
ations, and on other factors could be described in the
framework of DFT formulation, however, it will be the
subject of a separate study focused on the speciﬁcs of
AFM-assisted nanolithography.

Another reason for DFT choice with respect to Monte

Carlo technique is the convenience of generalization to
the case of the electric ﬁeld induced anisotropy. The
Monte Carlo simulations with additional orientational
degrees of freedom would require special cautions to avoid
local minima and to ensure proper sampling of the com-
plete conﬁgurational space, along with increased com-
putational time, especially in the cases of the low ac-
ceptance rates for the regions ﬁlled with a dense liquid.
Molecular dynamics seems to be less convenient as well,
because of the variable number of particles dictated by
the grand canonical type of the problem, and low densi-
ties in the vapor phase potentially providing insuﬃcient
number of collisions for proper statistical averaging. Ad-
ditionally, formulation of the analytical expressions, pos-
sible in the framework of DFT, is highly desirable. Fi-
nally, another advantage of DFT is a consistency in map-
ping of the 3D geometry into the quasi-2D description.
This avoids errors in quantitative prediction of the solva-
tion forces, present in the case of 2D lattice Monte Carlo
simulation.17

The paper is organized as follows. Section II is en-
titled ”Model and Methodology”. The ﬁrst part of the
section describes the model including non-local density
functional formulation and speciﬁcs of ﬂuid, while the
second part outlines the computational issues related to
the form of the integral equation for density distribu-
tion. We discuss multidimensional integrals handling,
and describe the iterative procedure developed. The Sec-
tion III A concerns with elucidation of the model parame-
ters of the ﬂuid from the bulk behavior. The Section III B
presents the results of calculations. The meniscus’s size
and its variation with respect to the relative humidity
and wall separation are discussed. The Section III C ad-
dresses determination of the ﬂuid-wall interaction param-
eters to link the model’s calculations to particular mate-
rial systems. The procedure is based on the polymolec-
ular adsorption isotherms. The Section IV presents the
summary.

II. MODEL AND METHODOLOGY

A. Model description

The nano-scale junction consists of planar surface and
spherical asperity of the radius R, separated from the
surface at the distance t (Fig. 1). The choice of the
cylindrical coordinate system is related to the azimuthal
symmetry. The ﬂuid is nonuniformly distributed in the
junction.

The purpose of the equilibrium DFT applied to the
inhomogeneous ﬂuid is to ﬁnd the spatial distribution for
the number density of molecules, ρ (~r), by minimizing the
grand potential Ω, presented as a functional of ρ (~r) for
the grand canonical (T, V, µ) ensemble23,24:

sisting of a planar surface and a spherical asperity with cur-
vature radius R, separated by the distance t. The ﬂuid is
nonuniformly distributed in the junction. The model resem-
bles AFM tip dwelling above a sample surface.

The intrinsic Helmholtz free energy functional, F [ρ (~r)],
incorporates the properties of ﬂuid. In general case, the
functional depends on the external potential Vext (~r) if
the intermolecular forces and/or intramolecular degrees
of freedom are aﬀected by the external ﬁeld. However, we
defer this discussion to the second part of the study, and
consider F [ρ (~r)] invariant with respect to Vext (~r). The
external potential describes the solid surfaces in contact
with ﬂuid, and induces inhomogeneiety in the system.
The chemical potential µ is related to the ambient hu-
midity.

The Helmholtz free energy functional F [ρ (~r)] can be

presented as

F [ρ (~r)] = Fid [ρ (~r)] + ∆Frep [ρ (~r)] + ∆Fattr [ρ (~r)] , (2)

where Fid [ρ (~r)] corresponds to the ideal system without
intermolecular interactions, and the other two terms de-
scribe additional intermolecular repulsion and attraction,
respectively. The ideal part of the Helmholtz free energy
functional is given explicitly by

hard sphere systems, the choice of the generalized van der
Waals model is justiﬁed in the systems with strong inter-
molecular attraction,26 which is the case of our interest.
In the framework of the mean ﬁeld approximation, the

free energy functional can be written as:

Φattr (~r) is a square well potential characterized by two
eﬀective parameters such as the depth (ǫ), and the width
(d) of the well. This choice is related to the fact that
in water, the short-range hydrogen bonding dominates
the longer-range dipole-dipole and higher order interac-
tions. Similar forms of attractive potentials were used
before.28,29

The iterative method used to solve nonlinear integral
Eq. (10) deserves special description. Simple successive
approximation procedure normally fails for the equations
similar to (10) even for one-dimensional problems as the
computation diverges after the few iterations.26,27 Sev-
eral approaches were used to overcome this diﬃculty for
the one-dimensional case. Tarazona27 used the mixing
of the new and previous iterative values with a space-
dependent mixing function. While this approach ﬁxes
divergence, it requires a careful selection of the mixing
function through trial end error, and converges slowly.
Vanderlick et.al.26 used a uniform discretization of the
domain and converted an integral equation into the sys-
tem of nonlinear algebraic equations. This works well for
one-dimensional problems, but is subjective to the choice
of the discretization method.

In our model, the spatial domain for which Eq. (10) has
to be solved is two dimensional and asymmetric, which
requires a general approach. Below we suggest an iter-
ative scheme conceptually similar to Newton’s iterative
method for the systems of algebraic equations. The gen-
eral form of Eq. (10) can be written as:

ln ρ + Φ (ρ) = B,

(13)

where Φ (ρ) has a complicated dependence with respect
to ρ. The iterative scheme is set up in the form

Here ρ(k) is an approximation for ρ (r, z) obtained at kth
iteration. The integral terms appearing in Φ and its
derivative are calculated simultaneously. The equation
to be solved at mth iteration has the following form:

(cid:17) (cid:18)

The density of water under critical point conditions, ρc,
results in σ = 2.8˚A, which is commonly taken as a hard
sphere diameter of water molecule.29 Separation of the
parameters ǫ and d in the second group is not necessary
as they are always grouped together in this form.

The second consideration for the bulk ﬂuid deals with
liquid-vapor coexistence at the temperature T = 300 K.
Two coexistence equations are derived assuming the
chemical potential and pressure equal for both phases.
The chemical potential is given by Eq. (17), and the pres-
sure is presented as a function of number density, P (ρ),
using the expression for the grand canonical potential, Ω,

FIG. 2: Water condensation between planar surface and

area corresponds to the formation of liquid meniscus. No liq-
uid bridge is formed for given Hr when t reaches ordinate
of the open circle. The parameters of ﬂuid interaction with
conﬁning walls are ǫsǫ−1 = 1 and ασ = 2.

B. Liquid meniscus condensation in the nanoscale
junction

The ﬂuid density distribution was calculated, using the
methodology above, in the geometry illustrated in Fig. 1,
for diﬀerent values of relative humidity Hr and separa-
tion between conﬁning walls t, at T = 300 K.
It was
found that for certain values of Hr and t, the ﬂuid tends
to condense in the region near r = 0, forming a liquid
meniscus that connects the conﬁning surfaces. The ten-
dency for liquid meniscus condensation increases with Hr
and diminishes with the growth of t. The region in Hr

−
coordinates, corresponding to the meniscus formation, is
depicted in Fig. 2.

Fig. 3 presents typical density proﬁles: σ3ρ as a func-
tion of the axial coordinate zσ−1, for diﬀerent radial po-
sitions r. The density proﬁle for a given r is mainly
determined by the separation between the walls at that
point, providing that the ﬂuid-wall interaction parame-
ters are ﬁxed. Inside the meniscus, the density is higher
near the walls and exhibits maxima in-between (Fig. 3).
Signiﬁcant density redistribution occurs near the menis-
cus boundary. For the longer radial distances, the liquid
wets conﬁning surfaces according to the speciﬁed values
of ǫs and α.

An essential question is how to deﬁne the size of liquid
meniscus based on the computed ﬂuid density distribu-
tion, or what factors deﬁne liquid/vapor boundary for a
smooth density distribution in the asymmetric geometry.
The answer can be found should we specify the phenom-
ena of interest and its description based on the dimen-
sions of the liquid bridge. The description of the charge
transport in nanoscale junction and calculation of the
forces exerted by ﬂuid on the conﬁning walls may require

the density proﬁles plotted in Fig. 3. The spaces on the
plot ﬁlled with dots correspond to the regions (domain
discretization points) for which the ﬂuid density exceeds
the threshold value ρth deﬁned above.

Fig. 5 illustrates the variation of the meniscus’s size
with respect to the relative humidity Hr. Again, the
spaces on the plots ﬁlled with dots correspond to the re-
gions for which the ﬂuid density exceeds ρth. The menis-
cus boundary shifts to larger values of r as humidity
grows.

Fig. 6 shows similar plots for the variable separation t
between the walls. The meniscus narrows (as can be seen
for tσ−1 = 2
3) and eventually disappears (tσ−1 = 3.5)
−
as t increases.

ﬂuid density exceeds the threshold value of σ3ρth = 0.16.
Other relevant parameters are: t = 3σ, ǫsǫ−1 = 1 and ασ = 2.
Curvature radius of the asperity is R = 36σ.

C. Fluid - wall interaction parameters: An
Estimation

The parameters, ǫs and α (Eq. (11)) characterizing the
energy of the ﬂuid interaction with solid surfaces (ǫs),
and the spatial range (α) of the corresponding poten-
tial, must be estimated for speciﬁc surfaces to apply the
results of the calculations to real physical systems. We
suggest using the polymolecular adsorption isotherms for
this purpose since the data of water adsorption is more
abundant than those related to other measurements.

The number of molecules adsorbed per surface area of
σ2 (integrated or Gibbs adsorption) with respect to the
relative humidity Hr for T = 300K is presented in Fig. 7.
A singularity is observed (not shown in the ﬁgure) as the
humidity (Hr) approaches 100%, consistent with thermo-
dynamical requirement.31 The isotherms exhibit typical
step-like structure (ǫsǫ−1
1) for the intermediate hu-
∼
midity values, similar to the results of calculations based
on three-dimensional Ono-Kondo lattice model32 and ex-
perimental data for multilayer adsorption of water.33 The
parameter ǫs for speciﬁc surface of interest may thus be
evaluated by ﬁtting the adsorption isotherm.

The above considerations imply both geometric and
energetic uniformity of the surface.
The geomet-
ric one means the average surface roughness is much
smaller than the separation distance (t) between sur-
faces. The latter assumption can be adapted to ener-
getically nonuniform surfaces by taking the eﬀective (av-
erage) value of ǫs and requiring that the radial region of
interest is large enough to sample most of the adsorp-
tion energy distribution. Additionally, it is assumed that
no signiﬁcant dissociation of water occurs on the surface,
and adsorption is reversible.

IV. SUMMARY

A spatial distribution of the water-like ﬂuid in the
asymmetric nanoscale junction formed in proximity of
a nanoscale asperity has been studied using an approach
based on non-local density functional theory. The ap-
proach presents a closed set of procedures modeling the
ﬂuid resembling water. The computational part of the
approach is adapted for asymmetric geometry of the
model comprising two solid surfaces. The basic frame-
work for the density functional description of the case
with electric ﬁeld induced anisotropy in the ﬂuid has been
developed. The route for quantitative predictions on the
water meniscus formation near atomic force microscope
tip dwelling above a sample surface is one of the impor-
tant applications of the developed methodology.

Our results suggest further development of the model-
ing in three directions. The ﬁrst direction would be a self-

8

consistent description for electrically charged or biased
asperity comprising electric ﬁeld and ﬂuid density distri-
butions. The second direction would be the calculation
of forces acting on the nano-asperity based on the density
functional formalism, which would have applications in
the context of AFM-assisted nanolithography. The third
direction would concentrate on the study of dynamical
phenomena at the nano-asperity including the kinetics of
capillary condensation under highly nonuniform external
potentials.

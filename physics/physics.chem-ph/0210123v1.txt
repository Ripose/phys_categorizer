Abstract

We present a density-functional theory based molecular-dynamics study of the struc-
tural, dynamical, and electronic properties of liquid methanol under ambient condi-
tions. The calculated radial distribution functions involving the oxygen and hydroxyl
hydrogen show a pronounced hydrogen bonding and compare well with recent neu-
tron diﬀraction data, except for an underestimate of the oxygen-oxygen correlation.
We observe that, in line with infrared spectroscopic data, the hydroxyl stretching
mode is signiﬁcantly red-shifted in the liquid. A substantial enhancement of the
dipole moment is accompanied by signiﬁcant ﬂuctuations due to thermal motion.
Our results provide valuable data for improvement of empirical potentials.

1. Introduction

Liquid methanol is of fundamental interest in natural sciences and of signiﬁ-
cant importance in technical and industrial applications. The liquid phase of
the simplest alcohol is widely studied, both experimentally and theoretically.
Among the alcohols, methanol is the closest analog to water. The character-
istic hydroxyl group allows methanol to form hydrogen bonds that dominate
the structural and dynamical behavior of the liquid phase. The methyl group
does not participate in the hydrogen bonding and constitutes the distinction
with water. This diﬀerence is apparent in the microscopic structure of the liq-
uid, with water having a tetrahedral-like coordination, whereas for methanol
experiments and molecular simulation suggest a local structure consisting of
chains, rings, or small clusters.

The precise quantiﬁcation of the microscopic structural and dynamical pic-
ture of liquid methanol has been a long-time subject in both experimental

and molecular simulation studies. Recently, a series of state-of-the-art stud-
ies have been reported. Among these are the neutron diﬀraction (ND) ex-
periments of Refs. [1,2]. Simulation studies include work based on empirical
force-ﬁelds[3,4], mixed empirical and ab-initio interactions[5,6], and a full ab
initio molecular dynamics study[7]. The recent ND experiments have provided
a detailed microscopic picture of the structure of liquid methanol, including
the pair distribution functions among all atoms. Yet, some of these atom-
atom distribution functions are still subject to some uncertainty as they are
obtained indirectly.

Molecular simulation provides a complementary approach to study the mi-
croscopic behavior of liquids. Most molecular simulations studies of liquid
methanol are based on empirical force ﬁelds potentials that are designed to
reproduce a selection of experimental data. Obviously, molecular simulations
based on these potentials do not provide a picture completely independent
from experiment. Moreover, the reliability of the results at conditions that are
signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from those where the potential was designed for, may
be questionable. Density functional theory (DFT) based molecular dynamics
(MD) simulation, such as the Car-Parrinello molecular dynamics method[8],
where the interactions are calculated by accurate electronic structure calcu-
lations provides a route to overcome these limitations. This has been demon-
strated in studies of liquid water[9,10,11] and aqueous solvation[12,13,14]. Im-
portant advantages of DFT-MD over force-ﬁeld MD are that it intrinsically
incorporates polarization, that it accounts for the intra-molecular motion and
therefore allows for a direct comparison with spectroscopy of intra-molecular
vibrations, and that it yields detailed information on the electronic properties,
such as the energy levels of electronic states and the charge distribution. In a
broader chemical perspective it is important to note that DFT-MD is capable
of the study of chemical reactions in solution, where force-ﬁeld MD would fail
completely as it cannot account for the change in chemical bonding.

Here, we report a DFT-MD study of liquid methanol that addresses the liquid
structure, the inter- and intra-molecular dynamics, and the electronic charge
distribution.

2. Methods and Validation

Electronic structure calculations are performed using the Kohn-Sham formu-
lation of DFT. We employed the gradient-corrected BLYP functional[15,16].
The choice for the BLYP functional was guided by its good description of the
structure and dynamics of water[10] where hydrogen bonds are, as in liquid
methanol, the dominant interactions. Furthermore, it has been shown that
DFT-BLYP gives a proper description of solvation of methanol in water[13].

2

The DFT-based MD simulations are performed with the Car-Parrinello method
[8,17] using the CPMD package[18]. Semi-local norm-conserving Martins-Troullier
pseudopotentials[19] are used to restrict the number of electronic states to
those of the valence electrons. The pseudopotential cut-oﬀ radii were taken
0.50, 1.11 and 1.23 a.u, for H, O, and C, respectively. The electronic states
are expanded in a plane-wave basis with a cut-oﬀ of 70 Ry yielding energies
and geometries converged within 0.01 ˚A and 1 kJ/mol, respectively. Vibra-
tional frequencies are converged within 1 %, except for C-O and O-H stretch
modes that are underestimated by 3 % and 5 % compared to the basis-set
limit values[13].

To validate our computational approach we compared results for the gas-phase
monomer and hydrogen-bonded dimer against state-of-the-art atomic-orbital
DFT calculations obtained with ADF[20], 1 and against the B3LYP and MP2
calculations of Ref. [21]. The CPMD-BLYP calculations were performed using
a cubic box with an edge of 12.9 ˚A, with the interactions among the periodic
images eliminated by a screening technique[17]. Results for geometry and com-
plexation energy of the dimer are given in Fig. 1 and Table 1. Deviations among
CPMD and ADF are 1 kJ/mol for the complexation energy, smaller than
0.01 ˚A for the intra-molecular bonds, and smaller than 0.02 ˚A for the hydro-
gen bond. This indicates a state-of-the-art accuracy for the numerical methods
employed in CPMD. Compared to the MP2 and B3LYP results, the BLYP
bond lengths are slightly longer, with deviations up to 0.03 and 0.05 ˚A for
the intra- and inter-molecular bond lengths, respectively. Diﬀerences among
BLYP, B3LYP and MP2 complexation energies are within acceptable limits,
with the BLYP energies smaller by 2-4 kJ/mole. The deviations are similar
to the comparison between BLYP[10] and MP2 2 for the water dimer and the
water-methanol dimer[23,13]. We obtained a zero-Kelvin association enthalpy
∆H 0(0) of 10.6 kJ/mol using the B3LYP zero-point energy of Ref. [21]. This
is in reasonable agreement with the experimental value of 13.2(4) kJ/mol.
The calculated hydrogen bond length (rO...O = 2.94 ˚A, rH...O = 1.95 ˚A) is
in good agreement with the experimental values of rO...O = 2.98(2)˚A and
rH...O = 1.96(2) ˚A of Refs. [24] and [25], respectively.

Current gradient corrected functionals such as BLYP do not account for dis-
persion forces. For methanol this could be important as attraction to the
methyl group is fully due to the dispersion force. To estimate the eﬀect of the
absence of the dispersion we computed the BLYP binding energy of two dimer
conﬁgurations that are sensitive to this: one with methyl groups approaching
(M-M) and the other with the methyl and hydroxyl group approaching each

other (M-OH). State-of-the art MP2 calculations[26], that incorporate to a
good approximation the dispersion force, serves as a reference. The dimer
conﬁgurations were taken from Ref. [26] and chosen such that the carbon-
carbon (M-M dimer) and carbon-oxygen (M-OH dimer) distances were close
to the peak position of their atom-atom distribution function in the liquid
state. 3 The comparison yields for the M-M dimer values of 2.3 kJ/mol and
−2.0 kJ/mol for BLYP and MP2, respectively. For the M-OH dimer these
values are −1.2 kJ/mol and −4.9 kJ/mol, respectively. The too repulsive na-
ture of the BLYP interaction is consistent with DFT calculations of dispersion
dominated systems[27,28]. However, although by far not insigniﬁcant, the mag-
nitude of the deviation is much smaller than the hydrogen-bond interaction
and of the same order of magnitude as the error in the latter. It can therefore
be argued that for a study of liquid methanol on the accuracy level of BLYP,
neglecting the dispersion interaction is acceptable.

In Ref. [13] we have shown that for the gas-phase monomer CPMD-BLYP
vibrational frequencies are in excellent agreement with ADF results and, com-
pared to experiment, underestimate allmost all modes by ≈ 10%, a known
feature of the BLYP functional.

Overall, we conclude that our level theory is satisfactory in comparison with
experimental and other theoretical gas-phase data.

3. Liquid

3.1 Structure

Liquid methanol was modeled by 32 molecules in a periodic cubic box with
an edge of 12.9 ˚A, reproducing the experimental density of 0.791 g/cm3 at
293 K[29]. The temperature was ﬁxed at 293 K using the Nos´e-Hoover ther-
mostat [30]. The ﬁctitious mass associated with the plane-wave coeﬃcients is
chosen at 900 a.u., which allowed for a time step in the numerical integration of
the equations-of-motion of 0.145 fs. The system was equilibrated for 1 ps from
an initial conﬁguration obtained from a force-ﬁeld simulation. Subsequently,
we gathered statistical averages from a 6 ps trajectory.

In Fig. 2 we have plotted the most characteristic atom-atom radial distribution
functions (RDFs), i.e. the hydrogen bonding O-O, O-HO, and HO-HO RDF and

the C-O RDF. For comparison we also plotted results of recent ND results[1]
and the peak positions obtained using Haugney’s empirical potential[3], the
latter being considered one of the most accurate empirical force ﬁelds to date.

The pronounced structure in the ﬁrst three RDFs are a clear indication of the
presence of hydrogen bonds. Comparison with the experimental data shows
that the positions of the ﬁrst peaks match within the statistical error for the
O-O and O-HO RDFs and is slightly smaller (≈ 0.1 ˚A) for the HO-HO RDF.
The height of the ﬁrst peak is in good agreement for the O-HO and HO-HO
RDFs, that both can be determined accurately from the ND data. However,
the O-O RDF shows a calculated ﬁrst peak height that is signiﬁcantly lower
than the experimental result. Given the small system of 32 molecules in our
simulation, the discrepancy could well be a system-size eﬀect. On the other
hand, the indirect way by which the the O-O RDF is extracted from ND data
could yield an overestimate of the O-O correlation. Comparison with force
ﬁeld results[3], that yield signiﬁcant higher peak values for the O-O and O-
HO RDFs, suggests that the Haugney potential overestimates the hydrogen
bonding structure in the liquid, in line with the observation of Ref. [1].

The number of H-bonds as calculated by integrating the O-HO and O-O RDFs
up to the ﬁrst minimum, and using the geometrical criterion of Ref. [3], yields
values of 1.9, 2.0, and 1.6, respectively. This is in good agreement with the
experimental ND results of Ref. [1] yielding 1.8 and 1.9 obtained by integrating
the O-HO and O-O RDFs. Applying the geometrical criterion to the Haugney
force-ﬁeld simulation[3] yields a slightly higher value of 1.9.

The hydrogen bonding in the liquid phase is accompanied by an elongation of
the OHO bond of 0.15 ˚A. A direct comparison with the experimental results
for this change in the geometry of the methanol molecule is rather diﬃcult
due to the large spread in the reported values. However, similar change in the
geometry is observed in the DFT-MD study of liquid methanol reported in
Ref. [7] and in ab initio studies of small methanol clusters[21].

The calculated C-O RDF is in reasonable agreement with the ND results, with
the overall shape well reproduced but the ﬁrst peak clearly less pronounced
than in the ND result. This is consistent with the, in the previous section
found, underestimation of the BLYP binding energy of the M-O dimer with
a C-O distance at the RDF peak position. This is due to the absence of
the dispersion interaction in BLYP. However, the absence of the dispersion
interaction clearly does not lead to a completely distorted C-O positional
correlation. The comparison of the calculated C-C RDF with the ND result
(not plotted) is very similar.

3.2 Dynamics

The time scale of the present simulation (6 ps) allows for an analysis of the
short-time dynamics of liquid methanol. Figure 3 shows the power spectrum of
the velocity auto correlation function (VACF) of the hydroxyl hydrogen. For
comparison we have also plotted the calculated 200 K monomer spectrum of
Ref. [13]. The three distinct peaks correspond to the OH stretch (3100 cm−1),
C-O-H bend (1600 cm−1), and the CO stretch (1000 cm−1). The broad feature
below 1000 cm−1 indicates the librational-translational (500 cm−1) modes of
the methanol molecules. Compared to the gas phase, the liquid OH stretch
mode has red-shifted by approximately 200 cm−1 and broadened consider-
ably. On the other hand, the C-O-H bending is blue-shifted by approximately
70 cm−1. The observed shifts and broadening are characteristic for hydro-
gen bonded liquids and also observed in the spectrum of water or hydrated
methanol. The calculated shifts compare reasonably well with experimental
infrared spectra[31] that yield values of −354 cm−1 and +78 cm−1 for the O-
H stretch and C-O-H bend. The calculated positions and shifts of the modes
match within statistical errors with those of methanol in aqueous solution[13]
determined using the same computational approach. This indicates that the
intra-molecular dynamics of methanol is aﬀected in a similar way by an aque-
ous environment and a methanol environment.

The diﬀusion constant D is a key measure of the collective dynamics. In view
of the limited length of the calculated trajectory we can only provide a rough
estimate. From the mean square displacement of the oxygen atoms we obtained
D = 2.0 ± 0.6 × 10−9 m2/s, in reasonable agreement with the experimental
value of 2.42 ± 0.05 × 10−9 m2/s [32].

3.3 Electronic properties

As the electronic structure is an intrinsic part of a CPMD simulation, detailed
information on the electronic charge distribution is obtained. To quantify the
charge distribution we used the method of maximally localized Wannier func-
tions that transforms the Kohn-Sham orbitals into Wannier functions whose
centers (WFC) can be assigned with a chemical meaning such as being asso-
ciated with an electron bonding- or lone-pair (LP)[33].

We calculated the positions of the WFCs for the monomer, the dimer, and 6
independent conﬁgurations of the liquid simulation. Table 2 lists the (average)
distances of the WFCs associated with the oxygen electrons. Most notably is
the small but signiﬁcant shift of 0.024 ˚A for the OH bond WFC towards the
oxygen atom when going from the monomer to the liquid. At the same time,

6

one of the LP WFCs shifts away from the oxygen by 0.023 ˚A. These changes
should be considered a manifestation of the hydrogen bonding and the induced
polarization among the dipolar methanol molecules in the liquid state.

To quantify the change in the charge distribution in a single number we cal-
culated the molecular dipole moment assuming the electronic charge to be
distributed as point charges located on the WFCs. For liquid water it has
been shown that such a partitioning of the charges over the molecules yields
a unique assignment of the WFCs over distinct molecules[11]. From Table 3,
that lists the values for the monomer, dimer, and liquid, we observe a sig-
niﬁcant enhancement of the dipole moment going from the monomer via the
dimer to the liquid. A comparable liquid-state value of 2.39 D has been ob-
served in a coupled empirical and ab initio MP2 study[5]. Note that the value
of the dipole moment is somewhat larger than in the Haugney[3] (2.33 D) or
AMBER[34] (2.2 D) force ﬁeld. A second important feature of the electronic
charge distribution in the liquid is its ﬂuctuating character due to the ther-
mally driven conﬁgurational changes. In Fig. 4 we have plotted the calculated
distribution of the dipole moments in the liquid phase. It shows that there is
a signiﬁcant variation ranging from 1.7 D to 3.5 D.

Conclusions

We have demonstrated that ab initio MD is a valuable approach to study
the structural, dynamical, and electronic properties of liquid methanol. The
calculated pair distribution functions involving the hydroxyl hydrogens corre-
late well with recent state-of-the-art neutron diﬀraction experiments of Soper
and co-workers. It conﬁrms their ﬁnding that one of the benchmark empiri-
cal potentials overestimates the hydrogen bonding structure. The calculated
oxygen-oxygen radial distribution function shows signiﬁcantly less structure
than the experimental neutron diﬀraction results. Currently we are studying
a larger simulation sample to see whether this is due to the small system size
in the present calculation. It could also be a result from an inaccuracy in the
experimental result that is obtained in an indirect way. Results for the dimer
binding energies and the oxygen-carbon RDF suggest that the absence of the
dispersion interaction is notable but has no major impact. Comparing the vi-
brational spectra of the liquid phase against that of the gas phase monomer
shows a signiﬁcant red shift of the O-H stretch accompanied by a smaller blue
shift of the C-O-H bend mode, in reasonable agreement with experimental
observations with the O-H shift somewhat underestimated in our calculation.
We quantiﬁed the electronic charge distribution using a Wannier function de-
composition. A small but measurable shift of the positions of the Wannier
function centers when going from the gas-phase to the liquid is accompanied
by a substantial enhancement of the dipole moment. Moreover we have found

7

that in the liquid the dipole moment ﬂuctuates signiﬁcantly with variations
up to half the average magnitude. The latter suggest that the assumption
made in empirical potentials using a ﬁxed dipole moment is a strong simpliﬁ-
cation. The present results may be considered valuable data for improvement
of empirical potentials for the study of liquid methanol.

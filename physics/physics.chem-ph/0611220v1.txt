We report quantum-mechanical close-coupling calculations for rotational state resolved
cross sections for p-H2+HD collisions. The low temperature limit of p-H2+HD is investi-
gated, which is of signiﬁcant astrophysical interest in regard to the cooling of primordial
gas and the interstellar media. Sharp resonances have been reproduced in the cross sec-
tions of some transition states at very low kinetic energies, Ekin ∼ 10−5 eV.

1. Introduction

Energy transfer collisions between H2 and HD molecules, where H is hydrogen and D
is deuterium, is of fundamental importance for the astrochemistry of the early Universe
and the interstellar medium [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]. HD represents the
second most abundant primordial molecule after H2 and plays a signiﬁcant role in the
cooling of the primordial gas. The abundance of deuterium is low relative to hydrogen
(D/H≈ 10−5), however the HD/H2 ratio can be enhanced by an approximate factor of
102 due to chemical fractionation [ 4, 6].

It has been shown, that in the framework of the standard cosmological model the radi-
ation temperature is higher than the matter temperature and molecules become a heating
source for the gas. At higher temperatures H2 molecules dominate the heating, however
HD molecules dominate the kinetic process at lower temperatures. In addition, the HD
molecule is especially important due to its permanent dipole moment and lower rota-
tional constant, which makes the molecule to be an eﬃcient coolant at low temperatures:
T . 100K [ 13]. When H2 molecules are ineﬃcient HD become important in cooling the
primordial gas and the interstellar medium. This ability of HD makes these molecules to
be very attractive.

Therefore knowledge of the ro-vibrational excitation and de-excitation thermal rate
constants in the molecular H2+HD low energy collisions is of fundamental importance
in understanding and modeling the energy balance within primordial gas. However, to
accurately model the thermal balance and kinetics of such systems one needs accurate
state-to-state cross-sections and rate constants kvjv′j′(T ).

Experimental measurement of quantum state resolved cross sections and rate coeﬃ-
cients is a very diﬃcult technical problem. On the other hand, accurate theoretical data
require precise potential energy surfaces and reliable dynamical treatment of the collision

processes. The ﬁrst attempt to construct a realistic full-dimensional ab initio PES for
the H2-H2 system was done in works [ 14, 15], and the potential was widely used in a
variety of methods and computation techniques. Currently the deuterium chemistry of
the eraly Universe has been extensively studied by many researchers. Here we would like
to mention works [ 7, 8] and [ 3], where the authors carried out quantum-mechanical
state-resolved calculations for low and very low temperatures down to 10 K [ 3], however
using of the old and modifyed H2-H2 surface [ 14].

Nontheless the importance of the H2+HD in the astrophysical problems makes it vital
to carry out new calculations for the system with recently published PES [ 16]. This is
done here in. Moreover, with the current calculations we extend our recent experience for
H2+H2 at low and very low kinetic energies [ 17, 18].

As was mentioned above a new extensive study of the hydrogen-hydrogen surface has
been recently reported by Boothroyd et al. [ 16], where the potential energies have been
represented at 48180 geometries respectively with a large basis set at the multireference
conﬁguration interaction level. In this work we provide the ﬁrst calculations describing
collisions of rotationally excited H2 and HD molecules using the BMKP PES

p-H2(j2) + HD(j1) → p-H2(j′

2) + HD(j′

The scattering cross sections are calculated using a non reactive quantum-mechanical
close-coupling approach. In the next section we will brieﬂy outline the method and present
results for the cross sections for rotational de-excitation of HD in low energy collisions
with p-H2. We compare our results with some previous investigations. Conclusions are
presented in Section 3.

2. Method and Results

In this section we provide a brief outline of the quantum-mechanical close-coupling
approach used in our calculations. The basis for this methodology was developed in work
[ 19]. The HD and H2 molecules are treated as linear rigid rotors. For the considered range
of kinetic energies of astrophysical interest and for practical astrophysical estimations the
rotor model is considered to be adequate for p-H2+HD collisions [ 8].

The 4-atomic H2-HD system is shown in Fig. 1. It can be described by six independent
variables: R1 and R2 are interatomic distances in each hydrogen molecule, Θ1 and Θ2
are polar angles, Φ2 is torsional angle and R3 is intermolecule distance. Let us introduce
M12 = (m1 + m2)(m3 + m4)/(m1 + m2 + m3 + m4) and µ1(2) = m1(3)m2(4)/(m1(3) + m2(4)),
where the ﬁrst one is a reduced mass of the pair of two-atomic molecules 12 and 34 and the
second ones are reduced masses in hydrogen molecules. As we mentioned, the hydrogen
molecules are treated as linear rigid rotors, that is distances R1 = 0.7631 a.u. in H2 and
R2 = 0.7668 a.u. in HD are ﬁxed in this model. We provide a numerical solution for the
Schr¨odinger equation for a 12 + 34 collision in the center of the mass frame.

The cross sections for rotational excitation and relaxation phenomena can be obtained

directly from the S-matrix. In particular, the cross sections for excitation from j1j2 → j′
summed over the ﬁnal m′

The kinetic energy is ǫ = E − B1j1(j1 + 1) − B2j2(j2 + 1). Here E is the total energy in the
system, B1 = 60.8 cm−1 and B2 = 44.7 cm−1 are the rotation constants of the colliding
HD and H2 molecules respectively, J is total angular momenta of the 4-atomic system,
α ≡ (j1j2j12L), where j1 + j2 = j12 and j12 + L = J, kαα′ = 2M12(E + Eα − Eα′)1/2 is the
channel wavenumber and Eα(α′) are rotational channel energies.

We apply the hybrid modiﬁed log-derivative-Airy propagator in the general purpose
scattering program MOLSCAT [ 20] to solve a set of coupled second order diﬀerential

We have tested other propagator schemes included in the MOLSCAT code. It was found,
that other propagators can also produce quite stable results.

The log-derivative matrix is propagated to large R-intermolecular distances, since all
experimentally observable quantum information about the collision is contained in the
asymptotic behaviour of functions U JM

where kαα′ = 2M12(E + Eα − Eα′)1/2 is the channel wavenumber, Eα(α′) are rotational
channel energies and E is the total energy in the 1234 system. The method was used for
each partial wave until a converged cross section was obtained. It was veriﬁed that the
results are converged with respect to the number of partial waves as well as the matching
radius, Rmax, for all channels included in our calculations.

The new BMKP PES [ 16], which is used in these calculations, is a global six-dimensional
potential energy surface for two hydrogen molecules. It was especially constructed to rep-
resent the whole interaction region of the chemical reaction dynamics of the four-atomic
system and to provide an accurate as possible van der Waals well. In the six-dimensional
conformation space of the four atomic system the conical intersection forms a complicated
three-dimensional hypersurface.

Because the BMKP PES [ 16] uses cartesian coordinates to compute the distances
between four atoms, we needed to devise a fortran program, which converts spherical
coordinates used in the close coupling method [ 20] to the corresponding cartesian coor-
dinates and computes the distances between the four atoms followed by calculations of
interatomic interaction forces.

The four atomic system is shown in Fig. 1. Let us introduce the Jacobi coordinates
{ ~R1, ~R2, ~R3} and the radius-vectors of all four atoms in the space-ﬁxed coordinate system

OXY Z: {~r1, ~r2, ~r3, ~r4}. We apply the following procedure: ~R3 is directed along OZ axis,
the center of mass of the HD molecule is brought into coincidence with the center of
OXY Z, and the top of the ~R3 is directed to center of mass of H2, as shown in Fig.
1. Now it is apparent, that ~R3 = {R3, Θ3 = 0, Φ3 = 0}, ~R1 = ~r1 − ~r2, ~R2 = ~r4 − ~r3,
and ~r1 = α ~R1 and ~r2 = (1 − α) ~R1, where α = m2/(m1 + m2). Next, without the loss of
generality, we can adopt the OXY Z system in such a way, that the HD interatomic vector
~R1 lies on the XOZ plane. Then the angle variables of ~R1 and ~R2 are: ˆR1 = {Θ1, Φ1 = π}
and ˆR2 = {Θ2, Φ2} respectively.

Now one can see, that the cartesian coordinates of the atoms of the HD molecule are:
~r1 = {x1 = αR1 sin Θ1, y1 = 0, z1 = αR1 cos Θ1}, ~r2 = {x2 = (1 − α)R1 sin Θ1, y2 =
0, z2 = −(1 − α)R1 cos Θ1}, and in turn for the H2 molecule we have: ~r3 = {x3 =
−(1 − β)R2 sin Θ2 cos Φ, y3 = −(1 − β)R2 sin Θ2 sin Φ, z3 = R3 − (1 − β)R2 cos Θ2} and
~r4 = {x4 = βR2 sin Θ2 cos Φ, y4 = βR2 sin Θ2 sin Φ, z4 = R3 + βR2 cos Θ2}, because ~r3 =
~R3 − (1 − β) ~R2 and ~r4 = ~R3 + β ~R2, where β = m4/(m3 + m4). In such a manner the
cartesian and the Jacobi coordinates are represented together for the four-atomic system
H2+HD.

Before our production calculations we carried out a large number of test calculations
to insure the convergence of the results with respect to all parameters that enter into the
propagation of the Schr¨odinger equation. The same calculations were also done in our
previous works [ 17, 18] for the o-/p-H2+H2 collisions, which involved the intermolecular
distance R, the total angular momentum J of the four atomic system, the number of
rotational levels to be included in the close coupling expansion Nlvl, and others (see the
MOLSCAT manual [ 20]).

We reached convergence for the integral cross sections, σ(j′

2; j1j2, ǫ), in all considered
collisions. For example, for R we used from Rmin = 1 ˚A to Rmax = 22 ˚A, we also applied
a few diﬀerent propagators included in the MOLSCAT program. We obtained convergent
results in all cases.

Below we present our calculations for the state-resolved cross sections σ(j′

2; j1j2)(ǫ)
in the collision (1). Fig. 2 shows our data for the (j1 = 1, j2 = 0) → (j′
2 = 0)
and (j1 = 2, j2 = 0) → (j′
2 = 0) quantum transitions together with the results of
Schaefer’s work [ 3], which applied a modiﬁed version of Schwenke’s potential [ 14] and
diﬀerent dynamical quantum-mechanical approach. As can be seen for these transition
states the agreement between the two diﬀerent calculations is excellent. We reproduced
sharp resonances in the low velocity region, which are very important in cooling of the
astrophysical media. In addition to Fig. 2 we separately show the cross section for only
(j1 = 1, j2 = 0) → (j′
2 = 0) transition states in Fig. 3. This graph can be directly
compared with the corresponding cross section from the Schaefer work [ 3], please refer
to ﬁgure 6 of that paper [ 3]. One can see, that even small peculiarities at around 250
m/s and 450 m/s of the cross section behaviour are reproduced in details.

2 = 0) and (j1 = 1, j2 = 2) → (j′

In the Fig. 4 we present the energy dependence of the cross sections for the (j1 = 2, j2 =
0) → (j′
2 = 2) quantum-mechanical transition
states. For the last transition we obtain very good agreement with the corresponding
results of work [ 3]. However, in the upper graph of Fig. 4 one can see rather large
diﬀerences in the low velocity region. Our calculations revealed, that the disagreement
ranges up to about 100 %.

1 = 0, j′

Finally, signiﬁcant diﬀerences are found in the cross sections from the higher values of
the transition states. Fig. 5 presents our results again together with Schaefer’s data from
[ 3] for (j1 = 1, j2 = 2) → (j′
2 = 0) and
(j1 = 1, j2 = 2) → (j′
2 = 0). In this case the disagreement ranges up to one order of
magnitude.

2 = 0), (j1 = 1, j2 = 2) → (j′

1 = 2, j′

1 = 1, j′

1 = j′

Also, as can be seen from the graphs we calculated few new resonances for each of these
transitions at a velocity of about 1200 m/s. The biggest value of these resonances is in the
cross section (j1 = 1, j2 = 2) → (j′
2 = 0). We show this separately in more detail
in Fig. 6. The value of the resonance is relatively large and it also might be applicable in
important astrophysical processes, such as collisional cooling.

1 = 2, j′

Through this analysis we can now conclude, that the new global BMKP PES can
reproduce general behaviour of all considered cross sections in the p-H2+HD collision.
For the lower quantum states we obtained suﬃcient agreement with previous calculations.
However, for transition states from higher values, for example, (j1 = 2, j2 = 0) the BMKP
PES provides rather low cross sections relatively to the corresponding results of work [ 3].

3. Conclusion

In this letter the state-to-state close-coupling quantum-mechanical calculations for rota-
tional excitation and deexcitation cross sections of the p-H2+HD collision are presented.
The linear rigid rotor model for the H2 and HD molecules is applied. The global and
newest BMKP surface for the H2-H2 system has been appropriately adopted for the cur-
rent p-H2+HD collisions. A test of convergence and the results for cross sections with the
BMKP PES are obtained for a wide range of kinetic velocities including very low values
down to 10 m/s.

Our results revealed, that for low quantum transition states the BMKP surface provides
cross sections very close to those obtained in previous works [ 3, 7], where the authors
adopted Schwenke’s old H2-H2 PES [ 14]. However, for some higher quantum states we
found signiﬁcant disagreements with previous results [ 3] (see Fig. 5). Additionally, in our
calculations some new resonances are found in the 1300±100 m/s region for transition
states from j2 = 2 and j1 = 1. It was found, that for the speciﬁc transition (j2 = 2, j1 =
1) → (j2 = 2, j1 = 0) the value of the resonance is relatively large in the cross section, and
it may even stronger inﬂuence, for example, the cooling processes in primodial gas and
interstellar media. Further detailed calculations for higher quantum transition state cross
2(T ) for o-/p-H2+HD collisions
sections and corresponding thermal rate constants kj1j2→j′
at low and very low kinetic energies are in progress in our group.

1j′

In conclusion, we would like to point out here, that the ultralow energy sector (T .
1 µK) is of crucial importance now in connection with the recently achieved molecular
Bose-Einstein condensates [ 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26]. Therefore, it should also be inter-
esting and useful to apply the current time-independent, quantum-mechanical approach
to investigate isotope eﬀects in molecular hydrogen collisions at such ultralow energies.
Further, the methodology could be used to carry out new calculations for the important
ultralow collisions considered in the works [ 27, 28, 29], as well as check the conclusions of
the recent work [ 30] involving scattering properties of weakly bound dimers of fermionic
atoms.

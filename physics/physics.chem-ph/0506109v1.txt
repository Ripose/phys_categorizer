Abstract

The State–Speciﬁc Kohn–Sham Density Functional Theory [arXiv:physics/0506037] is used to

derive the Kohn-Sham exchange-correlation potential vxc and exchange-correlation functional Exc

as explicit functionals of vs and ϕ1, where vs is the local, one-body potential from the Kohn–Sham

equations, and ϕ1 is the spinless one-particle density matrix from the Kohn–Sham noninteract-

ing state, say |ϕ1i. In other words, |ϕ1i is the ground state eigenfunction of the noninteracting

Schr¨odinger equation with the one-body potential vs. For simplicity, we only consider noninter-

acting states that are closed-shell states and interacting states that are nondegenerate, singlet

ground-states.

INTRODUCTION

The Kohn-Sham version of density functional theory plays a major role in both quantum

chemistry and condensed matter physics [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. Unfortunately, the exchange-

correlation functional Exc is an unknown, implicit functional, and there is no systematic

method to improve approximations. Recently we have derived a generalization of the Kohn–

Sham approach in which the correlation energy Eco is assumed to be an explicit functional

of v and ρ1, where v is the external potential from the interacting target-state, and ρ1 is the

spinless one-particle density matrix from the noninteracting states [8, 9]. In this approach,

errors from Coulomb self-interactions do not occur, nor the need to introduce functionals

deﬁned by a constraint search. Furthermore, the exchange energy Ex is treated as in Hartree–

Fock theory, as an explicit functional of ρ1. Below, we use this approach to derive the Kohn-

Sham exchange-correlation potential vxc and exchange-correlation functional Exc as explicit

functionals of vs and ϕ1, where vs is the local, one-body potential from the Kohn–Sham

equations, and ϕ1 is the one-particle density matrix from the Kohn–Sham noninteracting

state, say |ϕ1i. In other words, |ϕ1i is the ground state eigenfunction of the noninteracting

Schr¨odinger equation with the one-body potential vs.

II. STATE-SPECIFIC KOHN–SHAM DENSITY FUNCTIONAL THEORY

In state-speciﬁc Kohn–Sham density functional theory [8, 9], we use an energy functional

Ev[ρ1] that is assumed to be an explicit functional of the external potential v and the spinless

one-particle density matrix ρ1, where ρ1 comes from a closed-shell determinantal state, say

|ρ1i; this energy functional is given by

Ev[ρ1] =

h ˜Ψvρ1| ˆHv| ˜Ψvρ1i
h ˜Ψvρ1| ˜Ψvρ1i

,

where the trial wave function ˜Ψvρ1 generates the exact, or target, wave function, say Ψn,

under the following conditions:

| ˜Ψv̺1i = |Ψni; ̺1 −→ n, n −→ N, v,

where n is the electron density of Ψn, and Ψn is the ground state singlet eigenfunction of
ˆHv. The right side notation of Eq. (2) indicates that ̺1 is a spin-less one particle density

matrix that delivers the density n; according to the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem [1, 2, 10],

n also determines the external potential v, and n determines the number of electrons N.

Using Eqs. (1) and (2), we have

Ev[̺1] = En, ̺1 −→ n, n −→ N, v.

Here, En is the exact electronic energy of the target state:

ˆHv|Ψni = En|Ψni; n −→ N, v.

and the correlation-energy functional is

Eco[ρ1, v] =

− hρ1| ˆT |ρ1i +

− hρ1| ˆVee|ρ1i.

(12)

h ˜Ψvρ1| ˆT | ˜Ψvρ1i
h ˜Ψvρ1| ˜Ψvρ1i

h ˜Ψvρ1| ˆVee| ˜Ψvρ1i
h ˜Ψvρ1| ˜Ψvρ1i

Furthermore, ˜ρc is the correlation density of the trial wave function, i.e, we have

˜ρc(r) =

h ˜Ψvρ1|ˆΓ(r)| ˜Ψvρ1i
h ˜Ψvρ1| ˜Ψvρ1i

− ρs(r) = ˜n − ρs(r), ˜Ψvρ1 −→ ˜n, ρ1 −→ ρs,

(13)

and ˆΓ is the density operator; ˜n is the density of ˜Ψvρ1; ρs is the density of ρ1. Since ˜ρc(r) is

a functional of v and ρ1, we can also write ˜ρc[ρ1, v](r).

A determinantal state with the density matrix ̺1 satisﬁes the following noninteracting

Schr¨odinger equation:

Our energy functionals Ev are implicit functionals of the noninteracting density ρs. Hence,

any one-particle density-matrix that yields the interacting density minimizes our energy

functional, i.e., we have

Assuming n is a noninteracting v-representable density, there exist a noninteracting state,

say |ϕ1i, that has n as its density:

n(r) = ϕ1(r, r),

and this determinant—assuming it is a closed-shell determinant—is the ground-state solution

and vs is a local potential. Therefore, the canonical occupied orbitals from |ϕ1i satisfy the

where, with no loss of generality, we have required vs to be deﬁned by

(cid:0)

(cid:1)

vs = v + vn

J + vxc.

Using the approach by Sala and G¨orling [11], but permitting the orbitals to be complex,

it is readily demonstrated that vxc is given by

vxc(r) =

dr1 [2w(r1, r)ϕ1(r, r1) − ϕ1(r, r1)

(28)

and these operators appear in the exact Fock operator ˆF̺1, given by Eq. (15). By substituting

vxc repeatedly on the right side, we can obtain an expansion for vxc:

vxc(r) =

[2w(r1, r)ϕ1(r, r1) − ϕ1(r, r1)ϕ1(r2, r)w(r1, r2)

where in this relation it is understood that there are integrations over the dummy variables

r1, r2 and r3. The leading term of Eq. (29) is the Slater potential [12, 13, 14]; this term

5

also appears within the Krieger–Li–Iafrate (KLI) approximation of the optimized potential

method [14, 15, 16, 17].

The orbitals φw satisfying Eq. (25) are the Kohn–Sham orbitals [18]; |ϕ1i is the Kohn–
Sham noninteracting state. However, ˆf diﬀers from the Kohn–Sham operator, since, in
addition to depending explicitly on ϕ1, instead of n, ˆf depends explicitly on the external
potential v from the interacting Hamiltonian ˆHv. Furthermore, the external-correlation
operator ˆvρ1

ec does not appear in Kohn–Sham formalism. And, unlike the original Kohn–Sham

approach [18], the N-representability problem does not arise, nor the need to introduce a

constraint-search deﬁnition [19, 20, 21, 22] to avoid this problem.

III. THE KOHN–SHAM EXCHANGE–CORRELATION POTENTIAL

According to Eqs. (28), (18), and (19), ˆwρ1 is a functional of ρ1 and v, indicating that we

can, symbolically speaking, represent Eq. (29) by

vxc(r) = vxc[ϕ1, v](r), ϕ1 −→ n −→ v.

(30)

In other words, vxc is also a functional of v and ϕ1, where ϕ1 determines n, and n deter-

mines v.

Note that ϕ1 and v from Eq. (30) are not independent. Since, for a given v, the one-

particle density matrix ϕ1 which determines vxc from Eq. (30), and then gives vs from

(26), must also be the one-particle density matrix ϕ1 from the noninteracting state |ϕ1i

that satisﬁes Eq. (23). However, for a given ϕ1 or vs, we can also think of v as a dependent
variable to be determined. In that case, we choose vs, construct ˆf using Eq. (24), and obtain

the one-particle density matrix, say ϕ1, that satisﬁes Eq. (23). The external potential v is

then a simultaneous solution of Eqs. (26) and (30).

Substituting Eq. (30) into Eq. (26), gives

v = vs − vn

J − vxc[ϕ1, v], N, vs −→ ϕ1 −→ n −→ N, v, vs,

(31)

where the notation on the right side indicates that N and vs determine ϕ1, as indicated by

Eqs. (23) and (24); also, ϕ1 determines n; n determines N, v, and vs.

By substituting v on the right side of Eq. (31) repeatedly, as in Eq. (29), we can remove

it, giving, symbolically speaking,

v = v[ϕ1, vs],

6

(32)

Hence, this relation gives the external potential v from the interacting system Ψn, for n −→

v, as a functional of the local potential vs and the one-particle density matrix ϕ1 from the

noninteracting state |ϕ1i, where |ϕ1i is an eigenfunction of the noninteracting Hamiltonian

given by Eq. (23), and this noninteracting Hamiltonian is deﬁned by the local potential

vs, as indicated by Eq. (24). Furthermore, the noninteracting state |ϕ1i shares the same

density with Ψn; |ϕ1i is the Kohn-Sham determinantal state when n is noninteracting v-

representable.

Since there is a one-to-one correspondence between local potentials vs and noninteracting

ground states |ϕ1i [1], Eq. (32) can be written as

(33)

(34)

(35)

v = v[ϕ1, vs], vs ←→ ϕ1,

where the right side indicates the one-to-one correspondence.

Substituting Eq. (33) into Eq. (30) gives

vxc = vxc[ϕ1, vs], vs ←→ ϕ1.

Denoting vKS

xc the Kohn–Sham exchange-correlation potential [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 18], at least

for non-interacting v-representable densities, we have

vKS
xc [n] = vxc[ϕ1, vs], n −→ ϕ1, vs, vs ←→ ϕ1.

In order to obtain the density functional on the left side of Eq. (35), we need the function-

als ϕ1[n] and vs[n]. According the to Hohenberg-Kohn theorem [1, 2, 10], for noninteracting

v-representable densities, these functionals exist. For other densities, however, these expres-

sions must be generalized by, for example, using some modiﬁed constraint search deﬁnition,

or, perhaps, by an approach that permits vs to be nonlocal.

IV. THE KOHN–SHAM CORRELATION–ENERGY FUNCTIONAL AND EX-

CHANGE CORRELATION FUNCTIONAL

Using the notation form Eq. (4), the universal functional from the Hohenberg-Kohn

theorem [1, 2, 10], can be written as

F [n] = hΨn|

|Ψni; n −→ N, v.

(36)

ˆT + ˆVee
(cid:16)

(cid:17)

7

where Ψn is a singlet, ground state wave function. Previously we have shown that the

correlation energy from many body perturbation theory [23, 24, 25] can be written as an

explicit functional of v and ρ1 [26]. In a similar manner, but using less restrictive energy

denominators, the universal functionals F can be shown to be an explicit functional of v

and ρ1 [27], where this functional does not implicitly depend on ρ1, i.e., any |ρ1i that has

considerable overlap with |Ψni can be used as a reference state. So, we can write

F [n] = F [v, ρ1], n −→ v, n, ρ1 −→ N.

(37)

For noninteracting v-representable densities n, we can use Eq. (32), giving

F [n] = F [ϕ1, vs, ρ1], n −→ ϕ1, vs, vs ←→ ϕ1, ρ1 −→ N.

(38)

Setting ρ1 = ϕ1, we get

F [n] = F [ϕ1, vs], n −→ ϕ1, vs, vs ←→ ϕ1.

(39)

Hence, assuming the existence of the explicit functional, given by Eq. (37), Eq. (39) gives

this functional as an explicit functional of vs and ϕ1, where vs is the local, one-body potential

from the Kohn–Sham equations, and ϕ1 is the spinless one-particle density matrix from the

Kohn–Sham noninteracting state |ϕ1i.

Using Eq. (39), the exchange-correlation functional from the Kohn-Sham formalism [18]

EKS

xc [n] = F [ϕ1, vs] − EJ [n] − hϕ1| ˆT |ϕ1i, n −→ ϕ1, vs.

It is well know that the Kohn–Sham exchange functional is given by [2, 22]

EKS

x [n] = Ex[ϕ1], n −→ ϕ1.

Hence, the Kohn–Sham correlation-energy functional is

Eco[n]KS = F [ϕ1, vs] − hϕ1| ˆT |ϕ1i − hϕ1| ˆVee|ϕ1i,

is

where

(40)

(41)

(42)

(43)

hϕ1| ˆVee|ϕ1i = EJ [n] + Ex[ϕ1].

APPENDIX A: THE KOHN–SHAM CORRELATION-ENERGY FUNCTIONAL

FROM STATE–SPECIFIC KOHN–SHAM DENSITY FUNCTIONAL THEORY

Consider the energy functional Ev[ρ1, v′] that is obtained by permitting the external
potential from the trial wave function, say v′, to diﬀer from the one from the Hamiltonian
ˆHv; generalizing Eq. (1) in this way, we have

Ev[ρ1, v′] =

h ˜Ψv′ρ1| ˆHv| ˜Ψv′ρ1i
h ˜Ψv′ρ1| ˜Ψv′ρ1i

.

and Eqs. (2), (3), and (9) become

| ˜Ψv′̺1i = |Ψni; v′ = v, ̺1 −→ n, n −→ N, v,

Ev[̺1, v] = En.

Ev[ρ1, v′] = E1[ρ1, v] + Eco[ρ1, v′] +

dr v(r)˜ρc[ρ1, v′](r),

where we have explicitly mentioned the dependence of ˜ρc on ρ1 and v′, and the energy

through the ﬁrst order, E1, is given by

Auto-correlation Function Analysis of Scattered
Light Intensity at Diﬀerent Scattering Angles

Yong Sun∗

February 2, 2008

Abstract

In this work, the eﬀects of the scattering angle on the nonexponential-
ity of the normalized time auto-correlation function of the scattered light
intensity g(2) (τ ) are investigated using dilute Poly(N -isopropylacrylamide)
microgel and standard polystyrene latex samples in dispersion respec-
tively. The results show that the inﬂuences of the scattering angle on
the deviation between an exponentiality and g(2) (τ ) are small. With the
assistance of the simulated data of g(2) (τ ), the eﬀects of the particle size
distribution and scattering angle on the deviation between an exponen-
tiality and g(2) (τ ) are explored. The analysis reveals that the nonexpo-
nentiality of g(2) (τ ) is determined by the particle size distribution and
scattering angle. In general, the inﬂuences of the particle size distribution
are small on the nonexponentiality of g(2) (τ ) and very large on the initial
slope of the logarithm of g(2) (τ ) and the eﬀects of the scattering angle are
determined by the particle size distribution and mean particle size. Under
some conditions, the deviation between an exponentiality and g(2) (τ ) is
greatly inﬂuenced by the scattering angle. The values of the apparent
hydrodynamic radius are also determined by the particle size distribu-
tion and scattering angle. The apparent hydrodynamic radius and its
distribution obtained using the cumulants method are diﬀerent from the
hydrodynamic radius and its distribution.

1 INTRODUCTION

Light scattering is a widely used technique to measure the properties of particles
in colloidal dispersion systems. One of the main applications of the dynamic
light scattering (DLS) technique is to measure the sizes of spherical particles
in liquid suspension. The standard method of cumulants [1–4] has been used
to measure the hydrodynamic radius, or more strictly apparent hydrodynamic
radius Rh,app [5] of particles from the normalized time auto-correlation function
of the scattered light intensity g(2) (τ ) with the assistance of the Einstein-Stokes
relation, where τ is the delay time. In order to obtain the eﬀective diﬀusion

coeﬃcient [6] or the apparent hydrodynamic radius [5] to detect small poly-
dispersities for large particles, DLS technique is endeavored to use at diﬀerent
scattering angles.

In the previous work [7–9], the particle size information included in the static
and dynamic light scattering data and the inﬂuences of particle size distribu-
tion on the deviation between an exponentiality and g(2) (τ ) at a scattering
angle of 30o have been explored. The particle size distributions obtained using
diﬀerent techniques have been compared. In this work, the eﬀects of the scat-
tering angle on the nonexponentiality of g(2) (τ ) are investigated using dilute
Poly(N -isopropylacrylamide) microgel and standard polystyrene latex samples
in dispersion respectively. The results show that the eﬀects of the scattering
angle on the deviation between an exponentiality and g(2) (τ ) are small. Since
the method of cumulants measures the particle size distribution from the non-
exponentiality of g(2) (τ ) at a single scattering angle, the simulated data were
thus used to explore the eﬀects of the particle size distribution on the diﬀer-
ence between them at diﬀerent scattering angles. The analysis reveals that the
deviation between an exponentiality and g(2) (τ ) is determined by the particle
size distribution and scattering angle. In general, the inﬂuences of the particle
size distribution are small on the nonexponentiality of g(2) (τ ) and very large
on the initial slope of the logarithm of g(2) (τ ) and the eﬀects of the scattering
angle are determined by the particle size distribution and mean particle size.
Under some conditions, the deviations between an exponentiality and g(2) (τ )
are greatly inﬂuenced by the scattering angle. The values of the apparent hy-
drodynamic radius are also determined by the particle size distribution and
scattering angle. The apparent hydrodynamic radius and its distribution ob-
tained using the cumulants method are diﬀerent from the hydrodynamic radius
and its distribution.

3 EXPERIMENT

The SLS and DLS data were measured using the instrument built by ALV-
Laser Vertriebsgesellschaft m.b.H (Langen, Germany). It utilizes an ALV-5000
Multiple Tau Digital Correlator and a JDS Uniphase 1145P He-Ne laser to
provide a 23 mW vertically polarized laser at wavelength of 632.8 nm.

In this work, two kinds of samples were used. One is PNIPAM submicron
spheres and the other is standard polystyrene latex spheres. The samples used
in this work have been detailed before [7]. The four PNIPAM microgel samples

3

PNIPAM-0, PNIPAM-1, PNIPAM-2 and PNIPAM-5 were named according to
the molar ratios nB/nN of cross-linker N, N ′-methylenebisacrylamide over N -
isopropylacrylamide. The sulfate polystyrene latex with a normalized mean
radius of 33.5 nm and surfactant-free sulfate polystyrene latex of 55 nm were
named Latex-1 and Latex-2 respectively.

4 DATA ANALYSIS

In this section, the nonexponentiality of g(2) (τ ) is investigated using the stan-
dard polystyrene latex and PNIPAM samples at diﬀerent scattering angles.

4.1 Small particles

For small particles, the standard DLS technique can be used at any given scat-
tering angle. For narrow particle size distributions, the eﬀects of the form factor
can be neglected, the particle size information obtained at diﬀerent scattering
angles should be the same. The particle sizes and distributions of the stan-
dard polystyrene latex samples Latex-1 and Latex-2 provided by the supplier
are small and narrow respectively. The deviation between an exponentiality
and g(2) (τ ) are investigated at a temperature of 298.5 K and scattering angles
30o, 40o, 50o, 60o, 70o, 80o, 90o, 100o, 120o, 130o, 140o and 150o, respectively.
g(2) (τ )
The logarithm of the DLS data ln
was plotted as a function of
the delay time τ , respectively. The results for Latex-1 and Latex-2 measured
at scattering angles 30o, 60o, 90o, 120o and 150o are shown in Figs. 1a and 1b
respectively. Figure 1 shows clearly the nonexponentiality of g(2) (τ ) at a given
scattering angle investigated is small. The values of apparent hydrodynamic
radius obtained at diﬀerent scattering angles almost are equal. For Latex-1 and
Latex-2, the values are about 37.27 nm and 64.5 nm respectively.

(cid:1)

For PNIPAM samples at high temperatures, the particle sizes and distribu-
tions obtained using the SLS technique are small and narrow. The nonexponen-
tiality of g(2) (τ ) for PNIPAM samples at hight temperatures are investigated as
the standard polystyrene latex samples Latex-1 and Latex-2 at a temperature
of 298.5 K. The results for PNIPAM-1 and PNIPAM-2 at about a temperature
of 312.6 K and scattering angles 30o, 60o, 90o, 120o and 150o are shown in
Figs. 2a and 2b respectively. Figure 2 shows clearly the nonexponentiality of
g(2) (τ ) at a given scattering angle investigated is small. The values of apparent
hydrodynamic radius obtained at diﬀerent scattering angles almost are equal.
For PNIPAM-1 and PAIPAM-2, the values are about 137.8 nm and 136.5 nm
respectively.

4.2 Large particles

For large particles, since most of scattering light is cancelled due to the light
interference in the vicinity of the scattered intensity minimum and the scattered

4

intensity at large scattering angles is inﬂuenced by the reﬂected light, the infor-
mation included in DLS data is complex. In order to avoid the considerations
for the situations, the nonexponentiality of g(2) (τ ) is investigated at small scat-
tering angles before the emergence of the scattered intensity minimum. For the
samples PNIPAM-1 and PANIPAM-2 at a temperature of 302.2 K, the scat-
tered intensity minimums emerge at about the scattering angles 85o and 97o
respectively, the deviations between an exponentiality and g(2) (τ ) are explored
before the scattering angle 75o. The logarithm of the DLS data ln
1
was plotted as a function of the delay time τ . The results for PNIPAM-1 and
(cid:1)
PNIPAM-2 at scattering angles 30o, 50o and 70o are shown in Figs. 3a and 3b
respectively. Figure 3 shows clearly the nonexponentiality of g(2) (τ ) at a given
scattering angle investigated is small. The values of apparent hydrodynamic
radius are a function of the scattering angle. For PNIPAM-1 the values are
about 320 nm to 310 nm and for PNIPAM-2 the values are from 300 nm to 295
nm during scattering angle range from 30o to 70o.

5 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Because the distributions of the PNIPAM submicron and standard polystyrene
latex samples are narrow and the expected values of the DLS data calculated
based on the commercial and static particle size information are consistent with
the experimental data [7, 8], the DLS simulated data were used in order to
explore the eﬀects of particle size distribution on the deviation between an ex-
ponentiality and g(2) (τ ) and the initial slope of the logarithm of g(2) (τ ) at
diﬀerent scattering angles in detail. The method that produces the DLS simu-
lated data has been detailed before [7]. In this work, the number distribution
of particle sizes is still chosen as a Gaussian distribution

found that the uncertainties in parameters decrease and

as the delay time range is increased. From Eq. 6, the relative width of the
apparent hydrodynamic radius distribution is about 0.16. This value is equal
to that of the relative width of the apparent hydrodynamic radius distribution
obtained at a scattering angle of 30o [9] and diﬀerent from the relative width of

The ﬁt results for other particle size distributions also have been analyzed.
The simulated data were produced using the same temperature T , viscosity of
the solvent η0, wavelength of laser light λ, mean static radius
, constant a
and refractive index of the water ns. The standard deviations and scattering
angles θ were set to 3 nm, 5 nm, 15 nm, 20 nm and 25 nm and 60o, 90o,
120o and 150o, respectively. Since the standard method of cumulants obtains
the distribution of apparent hydrodynamic radius from the deviation between
an exponentiality and g(2) (τ ) at a single scattering angle, the simulated data
were used to investigated the eﬀects of the particle size distributions on the
nonexponentiality of g(2) (τ ) at diﬀerent scattering angles. The logarithm of the
simulated data produced without noises and errors was plotted as a function of
the delay time τ . All results for the standard deviations 3 nm, 10 nm, 20 nm,
25 nm and mean static radius 50 nm are shown in Fig. 5a for a scattering angle
of 90o and in Fig. 5b for a scattering angle of 150o. Figure 5 shows the eﬀects of
the standard deviation are small on the nonexponentiality of g(2) (τ ) and large
on the initial slope of the logarithm of g(2) (τ )
at scattering angles 90o and
150o.

The results in Table 2 show that the value of the apparent hydrodynamic ra-
dius is greatly inﬂuenced by the particle size distribution. The part of apparent
hydrodynamic radius represents the eﬀects of particle size distributions. The
wider the particle size distribution, the larger the value of the apparent hydro-
dynamic radius. The consistency between the value calculated from Eq. 7 and
the result obtained using the ﬁrst cumulant also shows the deviations between
the exponentiality and g(2) (τ ) at scattering angles 90o and 150o respectively
are small even for very wide distribution like the relative width distribution
50%. The diﬀerence between the results obtained using the ﬁrst and ﬁrst two
cumulants is inﬂuenced by the particle size distribution. For narrow distribu-
tions, they are almost equal. For a wide distribution like 50%, the diﬀerence
is less than 5%. The relative width of apparent hydrodynamic radius obtained
from the deviation between an exponentiality and g(2) (τ ) is about 24% at a
scattering angle of 90o and 27% at a scattering angle of 150o for the simulated
data produced using the relative width of hydrodynamic radius 50%.

Comparing the results of apparent hydrodynamic radius obtained at scatter-
ing angles 30o [9], 90o and 150o, for narrow particle size distributions the values
of apparent hydrodynamic radius almost do not depend on the scattering angle
and for wide particle size distributions the values are a function of the scatter-
ing angle. However, for any situation of the simulated data produced using the
mean static radius 50 nm, the deviations between an exponentiality and g(2) (τ )
are small. In order to explore the question further, the new simulated data were
produced using the same temperature T , viscosity of the solvent η0, wavelength
of laser light λ and refractive index of the water ns. The mean static radius

The simulated data were thus used to explore the nonexponentiality of

of apparent hydrodynamic radius represents the eﬀects of particle size distri-
butions. The wider the particle size distribution, the larger the value of the
apparent hydrodynamic radius. The consistency between the value calculated
from Eq. 7 and the result obtained using the ﬁrst cumulant also shows the de-
viations between the exponentiality and g(2) (τ ) at a scattering angle of 90o are
small even for very wide distribution like the relative width distribution 40%,

lated data produced using the relative width of hydrodynamic radius 50% at a
scattering angle of 30o and 26% at a scattering angle of 90o. Meanwhile, accord-
ing to Eq. 1, the apparent hydrodynamic radius obtained using the cumulants
method is a function of the scattering angle. In order to investigate the eﬀects
of the scattering angle on the apparent hydrodynamic radius, the initial slopes
of g(2) (τ ) at diﬀerent scattering angles were divided by the square of the scat-
tering vectors respectively. The results for the simulated data produced based

7a shows the values of the apparent hydrodynamic radius do not depend on
the scattering angle for the simulated data produced based on the mean static
radius 50 nm with the standard deviations 3 nm and 10 nm, and are a function
of the scattering angle for the simulated data obtained using the mean static
radius 50 nm and standard deviation 25 nm. Figure 7b shows the values of
the apparent hydrodynamic radius do not depend on the scattering angle for
the simulated data obtained using the mean static radius 120 nm and standard
deviation 8nm and are a function of the scattering angle for the simulated data
produced based on the mean static radius 120 nm and standard deviation 24
nm. Figure 7b also reveals that the value obtained from the simulated data
produced using the mean static radius 120 nm and standard deviations 24 nm
at a scattering angle of 150o is equal to that obtained from the simulated data
produced based on the mean static radius 120 nm and standard deviations 8
nm and the nonexponentiality of the DLS data produced using the mean static
radius 120 nm and standard deviation 60 nm is very large at a scattering angle
of 150o.

In order to investigate further the eﬀects of the scattering angle on the
nonexponentiality of the DLS data produced using the static radius 120 nm and
standard deviation 60 nm at scattering angles 30o, 60o, 90o, 120o and 150o, the
plots of ln
as a function of the delay time τ are shown in Fig.

Figure 8 reveals the eﬀects of the scattering angle on the nonexponential-
ity of the DLS data are large. At scattering angles 30o and 60o, the plots
of ln
as a function of the delay time τ are consistent with
the lines respectively and at scattering angles 90o, 120o and 150o, the plots of
(cid:1)
as a function of the delay time τ deviate clearly from the
ln
lines respectively. According to Eq. 1, two terms P (q, Rs) and exp
include the parameter of the scattering angle. In order to investigate the ef-
(cid:1)
fects of the form factor on the deviation between an exponentiality and g(2) (τ )
, P (q, Rs) was set to 1. The simulated data were produced again at scatter-
ing angles 30o, 60o, 90o, 120o and 150o. ln
was plotted as a
function of the delay time τ , respectively. The results are shown in Fig. 9. Com-
paring Fig. 8 with Fig. 9, the nonexponentiality of the DLS data is inﬂuenced
obviously by P (q, Rs).

Table 4: Values of Rh,app obtained at diﬀerent scattering angles for the simulated
data produced based on the mean static radius 50 nm and diﬀerent standard
deviations using the intensity-weighted average diﬀusion coeﬃcient.

order to eliminate the eﬀects of the scattering angle, the value of apparent hy-
drodynamic radius can be obtained by approximating the scattering angle 0.
The calculated values obtained using intensity-weighted average diﬀusion co-
eﬃcient [6] were used to study this question in order to discuss simply. The
apparent hydrodynamic radius is calculated using the following equation

Rh,app =

R6
sP (q, Rs) G (Rs) dRs
sP (q, Rs) G (Rs) /RhdRs

.

R6

The values calculated using Eq. 9 are listed in Table 4 for the simulated data
produced based on the mean static radius 50 nm and diﬀerent standard devi-
ations at scattering angles 0, 30o, 60o, 90o and 120o, respectively. The results
show the values of apparent hydrodynamic radius are a function of the scatter-
ing angle and particle size distribution. Although the eﬀects of the scattering
angle are eliminated at a scattering angle of 0, the values of apparent hydro-
dynamic radius still are determined by the particle size distribution. Because
the distribution of apparent hydrodynamic radius is obtained from the nonex-
ponentiality of g(2) (τ ) related to the exponentiality of the average decay rate at
a single scattering angle, the apparent hydrodynamic radius and its distribution
obtained at a scattering angle of 0 are diﬀerent from the hydrodynamic radius
and its distribution.

6 CONCLUSION

The nonexponentiality of g(2) (τ ) is determined by the particle size distribution
and scattering angle. In general, the eﬀects of the particle size distribution are
small on the deviation between an exponentiality and g(2) (τ ) and very large on
the initial slope of the logarithm of g(2) (τ ) and the eﬀects of the scattering angle
are determined by the particle size distribution and mean particle size. Under
some conditions, the nonexponentiality of g(2) (τ ) is greatly inﬂuenced by the
scattering angle. The values of the apparent hydrodynamic radius are a function

of the particle size distribution and scattering angle. The wider the particle size
distribution, the larger the value of the apparent hydrodynamic radius. The
apparent hydrodynamic radius and its distribution obtained using the cumulants
method are diﬀerent from the hydrodynamic radius and its distribution.

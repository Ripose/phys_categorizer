Conformal mapping has been applied mostly to harmonic functions, i.e. solu-
tions of Laplace’s equation. In this paper, it is noted that some other equations
are also conformally invariant and thus equally well suited for conformal map-
ping in two dimensions. In physics, these include steady states of various nonlin-
ear diﬀusion equations, the advection-diﬀusion equations for potential ﬂows, and
the Nernst-Planck equations for electrochemical transport in quasi-neutral or sup-
porting electrolytes. Exact solutions for complicated geometries are obtained by
conformal mapping to simple geometries in the usual way. Novel examples include
nonlinear advection-diﬀusion layers around absorbing objects and concentration
polarizations in electrochemical cells. Although some of these results could be ob-
tained by other methods (e.g. Boussinesq’s streamline coordinates), the present
approach is based on a simple unifying principle with more general applicability. It
reveals a basic geometrical equivalence of similarity solutions for a broad class of
transport processes and paves the way for new applications of conformal mapping,
e.g. to non-Laplacian fractal growth.

Introduction

Complex analysis is one of the most beautiful subjects in mathematics, and, in spite
of involving imaginary numbers, it has remarkable relevance for ‘real’ applications.
One of its most useful techniques is conformal mapping, which transforms planar
domains according to analytic functions, w = f (z), with f ′(z)
= 0. Geometrically,
f ′(z)
and a
such mappings induce upon the plane a uniform, local stretching by
|
|
local rotation by arg f ′(z). This ‘ampli-twist’ interpretation of the derivative im-
plies conformality, the preservation of angles between intersecting curves (Needham
1997).

The classical application of conformal mapping is to solve Laplace’s equation,

i.e. to determine harmonic functions, in complicated planar domains by mapping
to simple domains (Needham 1997; Churchill & Brown 1990; Carrier et. al 1983;
Henrici 1986; Trefethen 1986; Batchelor 1967). The method relies on the confor-
mal invariance of Eq. (1.1), which remains the same after a conformal change of
variables. Before the advent of computers, important analytical solutions were thus
obtained for electric ﬁelds in capacitors, thermal ﬂuxes around pipes, inviscid ﬂows
past airfoils, etc. (Needham 1997; Churchill & Brown 1990; Batchelor 1967). To-
day, conformal mapping is still used extensively in numerical methods (Henrici
1986; Trefethen 1986).

Currently in physics, a veritable renaissance in conformal mapping is centering
around ‘Laplacian-growth’ phenomena, in which a free boundary moves in propor-
tion to (some power of) the normal derivative of a harmonic function. Continuous
problems of this type include viscous ﬁngering, where the pressure is harmonic
(Bensimon et al. 1986; Saﬀman 1986), and solidiﬁcation from a supercooled melt,
where the temperature is harmonic in some approximations (Kessler et al. 1988;
Cummings et al. 1999). Such problems can be elegantly formulated in terms of
time-dependent conformal maps, which generate the moving boundary from its ini-
tial position. This idea was ﬁrst developed in 1945 in the Russian literature by
Polubarinova-Kochina and Galin (Howison 1992), with recent interest in physics
stimulated by Shraiman & Bensimon (1984) focusing on the subtle issues of pat-
tern selection and ﬁnite-time singularities (Saﬀman & Taylor 1958; Howison 1986;
Tanveer 1987; Dai et al. 1991; Ben Amar 1991; Howison 1992; Tanveer 1993; Ben
Amar & Brener 1996; Ben Amar & Poir´e 1999; Feigenbaum et al. 2001).

Stochastic problems of a similar type include diﬀusion-limited aggregation (DLA)
(Witten & Sander 1981) and dielectric breakdown (Niemeyer et al. 1984). Recently,
Hastings & Levitov (1998) proposed an analogous method to describe DLA using
iterated conformal maps, which has stimulated a ﬂurry of activity applying confor-
mal mapping to Laplacian fractal-growth phenomena (Davidovitch et al. 1999, 2000;
Barra et al. 2002a, 2002b; Stepanov & Levitov 2001; Hastings 2001; Somfai et al.
1999; Ball & Somfai 2002). One of our motivations here is to extend such powerful
analytical methods to other growth phenomena limited by non-Laplacian transport,
inspired by recent work on dendritic solidiﬁcation in a ﬂowing melt (Cummings et
al. 1999) and quasi-static brittle fracture (Barra et al. 2002b).

Compared to the vast literature on conformal mapping for Laplace’s equation,
the technique has scarcely been applied to any other equations. The diﬃculty with
non-harmonic functions is illustrated by Helmholtz’s equation,

which arises in transient diﬀusion and electromagnetic radiation (Morse & Feshbach
1953). After conformal mapping, w = f (z), it acquires a cumbersome, non-constant
coeﬃcient (the Jacobian of the map),

which arises in two-dimensional viscous ﬂows (Batchelor 1967) and elasticity (Muskhe-

(1.5)

In this special case, conformal mapping is commonly used (e.g. Chan et al. 1997;
Crowdy 1999, 2002; Barra et al. 2002b) because solutions can be expressed in terms
of analytic functions in Goursat form (Muskhelishvili 1953). Nevertheless, given the
singular ease of applying conformal mapping to Laplace’s equation, it is natural to
ask whether any other equations share its conformal invariance, which is widely
believed to be unique.

In this paper, we show that certain systems of nonlinear equations, with non-
harmonic solutions, are also conformally invariant. In section 2, we give a simple
proof of this fact and some of its consequences. In section 3, we discuss applica-
tions to nonlinear diﬀusion phenomena and show that single conformally invari-
ant equations can always be reduced to Laplace’s equation (which is not true for
coupled systems). In section 4, we apply conformal mapping to linear and non-
linear advection-diﬀusion in a potential ﬂow, which is equivalent to Boussinesq’s
streamline coordinates in a special case (Boussinesq 1905). In section 5, we apply
conformal mapping to nonlinear electrochemical transport, apparently for the ﬁrst
time. Finally, in section 6, we summarize and brieﬂy discuss further applications to
non-Laplacian growth phenomena.

2. Mathematical Theory

(a) Conformal Mapping without Laplace’s Equation?

The standard application of conformal mapping is based on the following two

facts:

1. Any harmonic function, φ, in a singly connected planar domain, Ωw, is the
real part of a analytic function, Φ, the ‘complex potential’ (which is unique
up to an additive constant): φ = Re Φ(w).

2. Since analyticity is preserved under composition, harmonicity is preserved
under conformal mapping, so φ = Re Φ(f (z)) is harmonic in Ωz = f −1(Ωw).

Presented like this, it seems that conformal mapping is closely tied to harmonic
functions, but Fact 2 simply expresses the conformal invariance of Laplace’s equa-
tion: A solution, φ(w), is the same in any mapped coordinate system, φ(f (z)). Fact
1, a special relation between harmonic functions and analytic functions, is not really
needed. If another equation were also conformally invariant, then its non-harmonic
solutions, φ(w, w), would be preserved under conformal mapping in the same way,
φ(f (z), f (z)). (See Fig. 1.)

(b) Transformations of Diﬀerential Operators

In order to seek such non-Laplacian invariant equations, we review the transfor-
mation properties of some basic diﬀerential operators. Following Argand and Gauss,
it is convenient to represent two-dimensional vectors, a = ax ˆx + ay ˆy, as complex

The complex gradient has the essential property that
is analytic, in which case,

f = 2f ′ (Needham 1997). Since a

Under a conformal mapping, w = f (z), the gradient transforms as,

This basic fact, combining the ampli-twist property and the chain rule, makes it
easy to transform diﬀerential operators (Needham 1997). The Laplacian transforms
as,

laws, Eq. (2.5) and Eq. (2.6), are surely well known, but it seems that some gen-

applications.

(c) Conformally Invariant Equations

The identities (2.5) and (2.6) imply the conformal invariance of any system of

equations of the general form,

where the coeﬃcients ai(φ) and aij (φ) may be nonlinear functions of the unknowns,
φ = (φ1, φ2, . . . , φN ), but not of the independent variables or any derivatives of the
unknowns. Thus we arrive at our main result:
Theorem 2.1. (Conformal Mapping Theorem.) Let φ (w, w) satisfy Eq. (2.7)
in a domain Ωw and w = f (z) be a conformal mapping from Ωz to Ωw. Then
φ(f (z), f (z)) satisﬁes Eq. (2.7) in Ωz.

Conformal mapping is most useful when the boundary conditions are also invari-

respectively, where bi(φ) and bij(φ) are nonlinear functions of the unknowns, αi

obvious, so we focus brieﬂy on the latter.

It is convenient to locally transform a vector ﬁeld, F , along a given contour
as, ˜F = t F , so that Re ˜F and Im ˜F are the projections onto the unit tangent,

(e) Gradient-Driven Flux Densities

Generalizing ∇φ for Laplacian problems, we deﬁne a ‘ﬂux density’ for solutions

of Eq. (2.7) to be any quasi-linear combination of gradients,

Fi =

dient apply more generally to any ﬂux density,

These basic identities imply a curious geometrical equivalence between solutions to
diﬀerent conformally invariant systems:

Theorem 2.2. (Equivalence Theorem.) Let φ(1) and φ(2) satisfy equations of the
form (2.7) with corresponding ﬂux densities, F (1) and F (2), of the form (2.9). If

An important corollary pertains to ‘similarity solutions’ of Eqs. (2.7) and (2.8) in
which certain variables
involved in a ﬂux density depend on only one Cartesian

coordinate, say Re w, after conformal mapping,

φi}

φi = Gi(Re f (z)).

(2.11)

(Our examples below are mostly of this type.) Such special solutions share the
same ﬂux lines (level curves of Im f (z)) and iso-potentials (level curves of Re f (z))
in any geometry attainable by conformal mapping. They also share the same spatial
distribution of ﬂux density on an iso-potential, although the magnitudes generally
diﬀer.

(f ) Flux Integrals

An important physical quantity is the total normal ﬂux through a contour,
Nu (C), sometimes called the “Nusselt number”. For any contour, C, we deﬁne a
complex total ﬂux,

I(C) =

˜F

=

dz
|

|

ZC

ZC

F dz,

(2.12)

such that Re I(C) is the integrated tangential ﬂux and Im I(C) = Nu (C). From
Eq. (2.10) and dw = f ′dz, we conclude, I(Cz) = I(Cw). Therefore, ﬂux integrals
can be calculated in any convenient geometry, which has useful applications.

For example, if ˜Fw is constant on a contour Cw = f (Cz), then for any conformal
mapping, we have, I(Cz) = I(Cw) = ℓ(Cw) ˜Fw, where ℓ(Cw) is simply the length of
Cw. In the case of gradient ﬂuxes for harmonic functions, this is the basis for the
method of iterated conformal maps for DLA, in which the ‘harmonic measure’ for
random growth events on a fractal cluster is replaced by a uniform probability mea-
sure on the unit circle (Hastings & Levitov 1998). More generally, a non-harmonic
probability measure for fractal growth can be constructed for any ﬂux law of the
form (2.9) for ﬁelds satisfying Eq. (2.7).

3. Physical Applications to Diﬀusion Phenomena

arise in physics from steady conservation laws,

for gradient-driven ﬂux densities, Eq. (2.9), with algebraic or zero-ﬂux (ˆn

where Di(ci) is a nonlinear diﬀusivity, ui is an irrotational vector ﬁeld causing
advection, and φ is a (possibly non-harmonic) potential. This class of transport
processes includes steady nonlinear advection-diﬀusion in potential ﬂows, as well
as various case of ion transport in electrochemical cells.

Before discussing these cases of coupled dependent variables below, it is instruc-
tive to consider nonlinear diﬀusion in only one variable. The most general equation
of the type (2.7) for one variable is,

This equation arises in the Stefan problem of dendritic solidiﬁcation, where c is the
dimensionless temperature of a supercooled melt and a(c) is Ivantsov’s function,
which implicitly determines the position of the liquid-solid interface via a(c) = 1
(Ivantsov 1947). In two dimensions, Bedia & Ben Amar (1994) prove the confor-
mal invariance of Eq. (3.3) and then study similarity solutions, c(ξ, η) = G(η), by
conformal mapping, w = ξ + iη, to a plane of parallel ﬂux lines,

a(c) ∇2c =

a(G) G′′ = (G′)2,

where an ordinary diﬀerential equation is solved.

More generally, reversing these steps, it is straight-forward to show that any
monotonic solution of Eq. (3.4) produces a nonlinear transformation, c = G(φ),
from Eq. (3.3) to Laplace’s equation (1.1), which implies conformal invariance.
There are several famous examples. For steady concentration-dependent diﬀusion,

it is Kirchhoﬀ’s transformation (Kirchhoﬀ 1894; Crank 1975),

In summary, the general solutions to Equation (3.3) are simply nonlinear func-
tions of harmonic functions, so, in the case of one variable, our theorems can be
easily understood in terms of standard conformal mapping. For two or more coupled
variables, however, this is no longer true, except for special similarity solutions (as
described above). The following sections discuss some truly non-Laplacian physical
problems.

4. Advection-Diﬀusion

(a) Steady Advection-Diﬀusion in a Potential Flow

Consider the steady diﬀusion of particles or heat passively advected in a po-
tential ﬂow (Leal 1992; Redner 2001), also allowing for a nonlinear concentration-
dependent diﬀusivity. For a characteristic length, L, speed, U , concentration, C,
and diﬀusivity, D(C), the dimensionless, conformally invariant equations are

∇2φ = 0

and Pe ∇φ

∇c = ∇

(4.1)

·

·

where φ is the velocity potential (scaled to U L), c is the concentration (scaled to
C), b(c) is the dimensionless diﬀusivity, and Pe = U L/D is the P´eclet number. The
latter equation is a steady conservation law for the dimensionless ﬂux density,

F = Pe c ∇φ

b(c) ∇c

−

(4.2)

(scaled to DC/L). For b(c) = 1, these classical equations have been studied re-
cently, e.g. in the contexts of tracer dispersion in porous media (Koplik et al. 1994,
1995), vorticity diﬀusion in strained wakes (Eames & Bush 1999; Hunt & Eames
2002), thermal diﬀusion (Morega & Behan 1994; Sen & Yang 2000), and dendritic
solidiﬁcation in ﬂowing melts (Kornev & Mukhamadullina 1994; Cummings et al.
1999).

(b) A Class of Similarity Solutions

We begin by reviewing the derivation of a well known similarity solution in the
upper half plane, w = ξ + iη (η > 0), which we can then map to other geometries.
As shown in the top left panel of Fig. 2, we consider a straining velocity ﬁeld,

φ = Re Φ, Φ = w2,

u = Φ′ = 2w = 2ξ

2iη,

(4.3)

−

which advects a concentrated ﬂuid, c(ξ,
) = 1, toward an absorbing wall on the
∞
real axis, c(ξ, 0) = 0. Since the η-component of the velocity (toward the wall) is
independent of ξ, as are the boundary conditions, the concentration depends only
on η. The scaling function,

c(ξ, η; Pe ) = S(√Pe η) = S(˜η),

satisﬁes the ordinary boundary-value problem,

which is straightforward to solve, at least numerically, for any physical choice of
b(S). In the presence of advection (Pe > 0), Kirchoﬀ’s transformation, Eq. (3.6),
unfortunately does not remove the nonlinearity in Eqs. (4.1) and (4.5).

For a linear diﬀusivity, b(S) = 1, Equation (4.5) has a simple, analytical solution

(e.g. Cummings et al. 1999),

S(˜η) = erf (˜η).

(4.6)

If extended to the entire w-plane, where two ﬂuids of diﬀerent concentrations ﬂow
towards each other, this is equivalent to Burgers’ solution for a stationary vor-
tex sheet under uniform strain (Burgers 1948). In that case, (φξ, φη, c) is a three-
dimensional velocity ﬁeld satisfying the Navier-Stokes equations, and Pe is the
Reynolds number. Inserting a boundary, such as the stationary wall on the real
axis, is not consistent with Burgers’ solution, however, because the no-slip condition
cannot be satisﬁed. The wall is crucial for conformal mapping to other geometries
because it enables us to hide singularities in the lower half plane.

From the solution to Eq. (4.5), for every conformal map to the upper half plane,

w = f (z), we obtain another similarity solution,

φ = Re f (z)2

and

which describes the nonlinear advection-diﬀusion layer in a potential ﬂow of con-
centrated ﬂuid past the ‘leading edge’ of an absorbing object. Upstream of the
stagnation point, f −1(0), the layer’s width is O(1/√Pe ), consistent with simple
scaling arguments (Leal 1992). For a linear diﬀusivity, Eq. (4.6), examples of six
diﬀerent conformal mappings in Eq. (4.7) are shown in Fig. 2 and discussed in detail
below, but ﬁrst we consider some general features of this class of solutions.

(c) Equivalence of Flux Lines with Linear Diﬀusion

The ﬂux density for the class of similarity solutions in Eq. (4.7) is easily calcu-
lated in the w-plane and then mapped to the z-plane using Eq. (2.10). The result
is

where the ﬁrst term describes advection and the second, diﬀusion. The lines of
advective and diﬀusive ﬂux, which are level curves of Im f (z)2 (streamlines) and
Re f (z), respectively, are independent of Pe and b(c), as required by the Equivalence
Theorem. In particular, the diﬀusive ﬂux lines have the same shape for any ﬂow
speed or nonlinear diﬀusivity as in the case of simple linear diﬀusion (Pe = 0,
b(c) = 1), where c

Although this gives further insight into the mathematical structure of Eq. (4.1), it
does not provide a basis for conformal mapping because the coordinate transforma-
tion in Eq. (4.11) is not analytic. Moreover, determining the boundary conditions
on H for a given boundary-value problem (4.1) requires knowing the solution (φ, c)
in advance. For example, on a surface where the concentration is speciﬁed, the un-
known ﬂux would also be required. These diﬃculties underscore the fact that the
solutions of Eq. (4.1) are fundamentally non-harmonic, even with a linear diﬀusivity.
On the absorbing surface, Im f (z) = 0, the ﬂux density is purely diﬀusive and
in the normal direction. Its spatial distribution is determined geometrically via the
conformal mapping,

on Im f (z) = 0,

(4.12)

and only its magnitude depends on Pe . (For a linear diﬀusivity, we have S′(0) =
2/√π.) As explained above, this special property of similarity solutions is predicted
by the Equivalence Theorem, not only for advection-diﬀusion in a potential ﬂow,
but also for any other conformally invariant process (e.g. electrochemical transport).
What appears to be the ﬁrst and only result of this kind is due to Koplik et
al. (1994, 1995) in the context of tracer dispersion by linear advection-diﬀusion
in porous media. For the special case of potential ﬂow from a dipole source to
an equipotential absorbing sink, they prove that the spatial distribution of surface
ﬂux (related to the distribution of collected tracer) is independent of Pe . In that
class of problems the ﬂuxes due to advection and diﬀusion are always parallel. The
present analysis shows that the same conclusion holds for all similarity solutions
to Eq. (4.1), even if (i) the two ﬂuxes are not parallel or (ii) the diﬀusivity is a
nonlinear function of the concentration.

In proving their equivalence theorem, Koplik et al. (1994, 1995) transform the

(4.13)

where Φ = φ + iψ is the complex potential, φ, the velocity potential, and ψ, the
streamfunction. The physical interpretation of Eq. (4.13) is that advection (the
left-hand side) is directed along streamlines, while diﬀusion (the right-hand side)
is also perpendicular to the streamlines, along isopotential lines. In high-Reynolds-
number ﬂuid mechanics, this is a well known trick due to Boussinesq (1905) still
used today, e.g. to describe the advection-diﬀusion of vorticity (e.g. Hunt & Eames
2002). Streamline coordinates are also used in Maksimov’s method for dendritic
solidiﬁcation from a ﬂowing melt (Kornev & Mukhamadullina 1994; Cummings et
al. 1999). Because Boussinesq’s transformation involves interchanging indepedent
and dependent variables, it can also be viewed as a hodographic transformation
(Whitham 1974; Ben Amar & Poir´e 1999).

Boussinesq’s transformation can be viewed as a conformal mapping of the steady,
linear advection-diﬀusion problem to a plane where the ﬂow is uniform. Any ob-
stacles in the ﬂow are mapped to line segments (branch cuts of the inverse map)
parallel to the streamlines. For the class of solutions, Eq. (4.7), streamline coordi-
nates correspond to the conformal map, f (z) = √z, to the upper half plane from
a plane of uniform ﬂow past a semi-inﬁnite, absorbing ﬂat plate on the positive
real axis (the branch cut), as shown in the top right panel of Fig. 2. In streamline
coordinates, therefore, we have the boundary-value problem,

which Carrier et al. (1983) solve using the Weiner-Hopf technique. In unpublished
lecture notes, H. P. Greenspan solves Eq. (4.14) more easily by introducing parabolic
coordinates, motivated by experience with magnetohyodrodyanmic ﬂows in the
same geometry (Greenspan & Carrier 1959; Greenspan 1961), which results in the
similarity solution (4.6),

ξ = x2

y2,

η = 2xy,

c(x, y) = erf (√Pe η).

(4.15)

−

As explained above, the reason why the similarity ansatz works only becomes clear
after conformal mapping to non-streamline coordinates in the upper half plane.
(See also Cummings et al. 1999.)

As this example illustrates, streamline coordinates are not always the most
convenient choice, so it is useful to exploit the possibility of conformal mapping
to other planes, for both linear and nonlinear advection-diﬀusion. For similarity
solutions, it is much easier to work in a plane where the diﬀusive ﬂux lines, rather
than the streamlines, are parallel. Streamline coordinates are also not the best
choice in advection-diﬀusion free boundary problems because stagnation points are
associated with branch-point singularities. For ﬂows toward inﬁnite dendrites, it is
easier to determine the evolving conformal map from a half plane (Cummings et
al. 1999). For ﬂows past ﬁnite growing objects, it is more convenient to map from
the exterior of the unit circle and expand the map in a Laurent series (Shraiman &
Bensimon 1984; Hastings & Levitov 1998).

wall (rotated by π/2) is always recovered close to the stagnation point, f −1(0).

Another choice, f (z) = zπ/(2π−β), describes a wedge of opening angle, β, as
shown in the middle right panel of Fig. 2 for β = π/2 (after a rotation by π/4).
The half plate (β = 0) and the wall (β = π) discussed above are special cases. The

ﬁnite absorbing strip, which is equivalent to solving Wijngaarden’s transcendental
integral equation (Cummings et al. 1999). This important family of solutions and
its application to free-boundary problems will be described elsewhere.

(a) Dilute Solution Theory

Steady conservation laws (3.1) for gradient-driven ﬂuxes of the form (3.2) also
commonly arise in electrochemical systems described by the Nernst-Planck equa-
tions (Newman 1991). In this section, we review the complete steady-state equations
and boundary conditions, discuss some common approximations which produce con-
formal invariance, and give some simple, exact solutions. This appears to be the ﬁrst

application of conformal mapping to non-Laplacian electrochemical transport. In
certain approximations discussed below, the new technique could be useful in mod-
eling biological and micro-electrochemical systems, where steady states are easily
attained due to short diﬀusion lengths.

In dilute-solution theory, the ionic concentrations,

, and the elec-
trostatic potential, φ, satisfy Eqs. (3.1) and (3.2), where the ‘advection’ velocities,

are due to migration in the electric ﬁeld (E =

species. The Einstein-Smoluchowski relation, µi = Di/kT , relates the mobility to
the diﬀusivity, Di, Boltzmann’s constant, k, and the temperature, T . The potential

The complete system of nonlinear equations (5.3)–(5.4) and boundary conditions
(5.9)–(5.10) are quite complicated, so the theory of electrochemical systems involves
a hierarchy of approximations (Newman 1991). In the simplest approximation, the
‘primary current distribution’, the potential satisﬁes Laplace’s equation, and the
ionic concentrations are constants. This can be justiﬁed as the linear response of a
homogeneous electrolyte to a small applied voltage or current, where Ohm’s Law
holds, J = (
E. It is further assumed that each electrode is an
equipotential surface, e.g. given by the Nernst equation (5.8), which is the limit
1). With these assumptions,
of Eq. (5.6) for ‘fast’ reactions (k+ ≫
the potential is simply that of an electrical capacitor, i.e. harmonic with Dirichlet
boundary conditions, so standard conformal mapping techniques from electrostatics
can be applied (Churchill & Brown 1990; Needham 1997). Indeed, the primary
current distribution has been calculated in this way for many electrode geometries
in two dimensions (e.g. Moulton 1905; Hine 1956; Newman 1991). All physical
eﬀects beyond Ohm’s Law, however, are believed to break conformal invariance, so
it seems conformal mapping has not been applied to any more realistic models.

The ‘secondary current distribution’ also assumes a harmonic potential and con-
stant concentrations, but with kinetic boundary conditions, (5.6)–(5.7). In this case,
conformal mapping could be of some use. One would need to transform Eq. (5.6) us-
ing Eq. (2.10), which introduces a spatially varying coeﬃcient
in the boundary
condition, but one would still solve Laplace’s equation.

A more serious complication is to go beyond Ohm’s law and allow the con-

insight here is that the steady mass-conservation equations (5.3) are conformally in-
variant, for any number of ions. The Poisson equation, Eq. (5.4), is not conformally
invariant, but it turns out that invariance is restored into the usual approximation
of either a supporting electrolyte or a quasi-neutral electrolyte. This allows con-
formal mapping to be applied trivially in the limits of fast reactions and small
Stern-layer capacitance (Dirichlet boundary conditions) and with relatively minor
complications for the general boundary conditions, Eq. (5.9) and (5.10).

(c) Concentration of an Active Species in a Supporting Electrolyte

When a large number of inert ‘supporting’ ions are present, charge screening is
enhanced, and it is typically assumed that the potential satisﬁes Laplace’s equation.
This can be justiﬁed outside diﬀuse-charge boundary layers (see below), where
the other ions are roughly uniform in concentration and neutral overall. In this
approximation, the concentration, c1 = c+, of a current-carrying species of charge
z+ obeys Eq. (5.3) with a harmonic potential. The resulting equations,

∇2φ = 0 and

z+∇c+ ·

∇φ = ∇2c+,

(5.11)

are equivalent to those of linear advection-diﬀusion in a potential ﬂow, Eq. (4.1)
with b(c) = 1, where the ‘ﬂuid velocity’ is the electric ﬁeld and the ‘P´eclet number’
is z+. In this case, the analog of Boussinesq’s transformation would be a mapping
to electric-ﬁeld coordinates.

and iso-concentration lines are mutually orthogonal circles, as in the case of linear
diﬀusion, c+ = ef (z), although nonlinearity enhances concentration gradients near
the cathode (the inner circle). More generally, for two equipotential, equiconcen-
tration electrodes in any geometry, the spatial distribution of current along each
electrode with a supporting electrolyte is the same as in the primary current distri-
bution. This is essentially the theorem of Koplik, Redner, and Hinch (1994, 1995) for
advection-diﬀusion discussed above. The special equivalence breaks down, however,
for three or more electrodes (or more general boundary conditions).

expansions (Newman 1965) all the way up to the limiting current (Smyrl & Newman
1967) and beyond (Shtilman & Rubinstein 1979). The eﬀect of the diﬀuse-charge
layers can be incorporated into eﬀective boundary conditions on the bulk, which
still have the form of Eq. (5.6), although the Butler-Volmer equation (5.7) acquires
a ‘Frumkin correction’ (which is modiﬁed somewhat if λs > 0). This is actually
the most common perspective in electrochemistry, where the diﬀuse-charge layer is
incorporated with the Stern layer into a single ‘double layer’ (Newman 1991), and
the comments above about boundary conditions still apply.

With the conformally invariant equations

(5.3) and (5.14), the potential is
generally not harmonic (Newman 1991). Instead, it is implicitly determined by
J = 0. The deviation from a harmonic potential with the
charge conservation, ∇

currents.

same as in the primary current distribution, but not for more than two electrodes
or more than two ionic species.

6. Conclusion

We have observed that certain systems of nonlinear equations involving ‘dot prod-
ucts of two gradients’ are conformally invariant. This has allowed us to extend the
classical technique of conformal mapping to some non-harmonic functions of phys-
ical interest. A class of examples in transport theory includes steady conservation
laws for gradient-driven ﬂuxes.

For one variable, the most general equation in our class (with some well known
examples in nonlinear diﬀusion) can always be reduced to Laplace’s equation. For
two or more variables, however, the solutions to our equations are not simply re-
lated to harmonic functions, aside from special similarity solutions. By identifying
a broad class of equations with the same basic property of conformal invariance,
we reveal a geometrical equivalence among diﬀerent physical transport problems in
two dimensions, whose ﬂux lines and iso-concentration lines have universal shapes.
This gives physical signiﬁcance to the property of conformal invariance.

For two variables, there is one example in our class, linear advection-diﬀusion
in a potential ﬂow, to which conformal mapping has been applied extensively. In
this case, our method is equivalent to Boussinesq’s streamline coordinates, but
somewhat more general. A nonlinear diﬀusivity is also allowed, and the mapping
need not be to a plane of uniform ﬂow (parallel streamlines). In a series of exam-
ples, we consider ﬂows past absorbing leading edges mapped to a plane of parallel
diﬀusive-ﬂux lines (and curved streamlines). With these results, we generalize a
recent equivalence theorem of Koplik, Redner, and Hinch (1994, 1995).

Our class also contains standard limits of the Nernst-Planck equations for a
supporting electrolyte and a quasi-neutral electrolyte. In electrochemistry, confor-
mal mapping has been applied only to harmonic functions, so we present some new
results. For example, we ﬁnd that Ohm’s Law gives the correct spatial distribu-
tion of current on any pair of equipotential electrodes in two dimensions, even if
the transport is nonlinear and non-Laplacian (but conformally invariant), although
this is not true for three or more electrodes. We also calculate the concentration
polarization near the edges of two semi-inﬁnite, parallel-plate electrodes.

Although it is beyond the scope of this paper to do so, our results allow confor-
mal mapping to be applied to free boundary problems with non-Laplacian trans-
port equations. In particular, the Polubarinova-Galin (or Shraiman-Bensimon 1984)
equation for continuous Laplacian growth (Howison 1992) and the Hastings-Levitov
method of iterated conformal maps for stochastic Laplacian growth (Hastings &
Levitov 1998) can be extended to any conformally invariant transport (ongoing
work with J. Choi and B. Davidovitch). In this way, for example, one can analyze
fractal growth by advection-diﬀusion in a background potential ﬂow, a problem
which would otherwise appear to be intractable, even numerically.

The author would like to thank J. Choi for the beautiful, color ﬁgures; A. Ajdari,

a junior faculty leave; and ESPCI for hospitality and support through the Paris
Sciences Chair.

Multiple (real) solutions of the CC equations (corresponding to the CCD, ACP and ACPQ meth-
ods) are studied for the PPP model of [10]annulene, C10H10. The long-range electrostatic inter-
actions are represented either by the Mataga–Nishimoto potential, or Pople’s R−1 potential. The
multiple solutions are obtained in a quasi-random manner, by generating a pool of starting ampli-
tudes and applying a standard CC iterative procedure combined with Pulay’s DIIS method. Several
unexpected features of these solutions are uncovered, including the switching between two CCD
solutions when moving between the weakly and strongly correlated regime of the PPP model with
Pople’s potential.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The coupled-cluster (CC) method [1] is one of the ba-
sic tools for studying the electronic-correlation eﬀects in
many-electron systems. Due to their nonlinearity, the CC
equations may have multiple solutions; this problem was
ﬁrst analyzed by ˇZivkovi´c and Monkhorst [2]. Recently,
Kowalski and Jankowski
[3] applied to the CC equa-
tions a new powerful mathematical tool—the homotopy
(continuation) method [4]. By using this tool they were
able to ﬁnd the complete sets of solutions for the CCD
and the CCSD equations corresponding to some four-
electron four-orbital systems, known as the H4 and P4
models. Very recently, Podeszwa et al. [5] used the homo-
topy method in a study of multiple solutions to the CCD
equations for the Pariser-Parr-Pople (PPP) model [6, 7]
of benzene (6 electrons, 6 orbitals). The available data
on the CC multiple-solution problem is still very limited.
The purpose of this paper is to get some insight into
the multiple solutions of the CCD equations (as well as
the equations of some modiﬁed CCD methods) for the
PPP model of [10]annulene (10 electrons, 10 orbitals),
a system which is already too big to be treated by the
homotopy method.

Benzene and [10]annulene are the ﬁrst two members
of the family of cyclic polyenes (annulenes) CM HM ,
where M = 4m0 + 2, m0 = 1, 2, . . . , and the assumed
point-symmetry group is DMh. The problem of elec-
tronic correlations in annulenes, which may serve as
prototypes of one-dimensional metal, have been thor-
oughly studied within the PPP model by Paldus and
co-workers [8, 9, 10]. Due to the high symmetry of an-
nulenes, the contributions from the single excitations are
absent in the PPP model, and the CCSD method re-
duces to the CCD one. Paldus et al. discovered and doc-
umented the breakdown of the CCD method for these
systems. They also showed that this breakdown may
be attributed to the neglect in the CCD method the
terms providing the coupling between the D and Q exci-
tations. Paldus et al. devised an approximate coupled-
pair method, called ACPQ [8, 9], in which these coupling
terms (approximately) canceled certain quadratic terms
in the CCD equations. Unlike the CCD method, the
ACPQ method, and a related ACP-D45 method (ACP in

short) introduced earlier [11], were shown to perform well
for the annulenes, being convergent and giving the corre-
lation energies close to the full conﬁguration-interaction
(FCI) results. However, a recent CC study [12] of annu-
lenes, taking into account the double (D), triple (T), and
quadruple (Q) excitations in the CC operator, showed
that even the CCDTQ method breaks down for these
systems when the correlation eﬀects become suﬃciently
strong. Moreover, the ACP and ACPQ methods were
shown to fail for very large annulenes [13]. Thus, the
annulenes remain a challenging problem for the many-
electron theories.

II. FINDING MULTIPLE SOLUTIONS OF CCD,
ACP, AND ACPQ EQUATIONS FOR
[10]ANNULENE

In the CCD method, the CC operator corresponding
to the double excitations depends on some linear param-
eters, hereafter referred to as the t2 amplitudes. The
CCD equations comprise a set of quadratic equations for
the unknown t2 amplitudes. In the nonorthogonally spin-
adapted formalism (see, e.g., Ref. 14), the number of t2
amplitudes is equal to K = nonu(nonu + 1)/2, where
no and nu is the number of occupied and unoccupied
orbitals, respectively (no symmetry other then the spin
one is assumed). According to the B´ezout theorem, such
a set of quadratic equations may have up to 2K solu-
tions, a truly astronomical number in most applications.
Therefore, ﬁnding the complete set of CCD solutions
may be attempted only when the number of t2 ampli-
tudes is very small (e.g., due to the spatial symmetry of
the many-electron system).
In the homotopy study of
the H4 model [3] (corresponding to 6 spin- and spatial-
symmetry–adapted t2 amplitudes), the complete set of
CCD solutions numbered 12, which is distinctly smaller
than the B´ezout limit (64). On the other hand, the ap-
plication of the homotopy method to the PPP model of
benzene [5] (having 8 t2 amplitudes adapted to spin, spa-
tial, and time-reversal symmetry) has brought in some
quite disturbing ﬁndings: not only the total number of
solutions (230) approached the theoretical limit (256),
but some solutions led to the correlation energies much

2

more negative than that of the “standard” CCD solu-
tion (which approximate the ground-state FCI solution);
in addition all the “nonstandard” solutions were hardly
similar to the FCI ones.

In the PPP model of [10]annulene, the CCD equa-
tions adapted to spin, spatial, and time-reversal sym-
metry correspond to 29 t2 amplitudes. The ACP and
ACPQ equations are obtained by neglecting (ACP and
ACPQ) and modifying (ACPQ) some of the quadratic
terms in the CCD equations, see, e.g., Ref. 13. In the
present paper we use the PPP model of annulenes de-
scribed in Ref. 12 and follow the notation used there: β
(≤ 0) eV is the resonance integral of the PPP model,
and γ(R) is a potential describing the long-range elec-
trostatic interactions. We shall report the results ob-
tained for two variants of the PPP model: the PPP-MN
model, employing the Mataga-Nishimoto potential [15]
(γ(R) = e2[R+e2(γ0)−1]−1), with γ0 = 10.84 eV, and the
PPP-P model, using Pople’s potential [7] (γ(R) = e2/R
for R 6= 0), with γ0 = 14.25878 eV (e is the elementary
charge).

If the CCD results for benzene [5] may be extrapolated,
the CCD (and ACP and ACPQ) equations for [10]annu-
lene may have more than 108 solutions; that makes the
application of the homotopy method hopeless in this case.
On the other hand, it was found in Ref. 5 that some of
the real CCD solutions for benzene were stable within
their close neighborhoods: such a solution (subject to
the numerical rounding errors) led to a convergent iter-
ation process when the direct-inversion-of-the-iterative-
subspace (DIIS) method [16] was used. Thus, one may
expect that the DIIS method is able to trace various so-
lutions, if only the starting points are suitably chosen.

A standard method of solving the CCD equations is
based on the iterative procedure represented in Eq. (14)
of Ref. 5. By starting from the t2 amplitudes equal
to zero, one recovers in the ﬁrst iteration the t(1)
am-
2
plitudes corresponding to the ﬁrst order of the Møller-
Plesset (MP) perturbation theory; in the subsequent it-
erations higher-order MP contributions are added. Such
an iteration procedure, if convergent, furnishes the stan-
dard CCD solution corresponding (as it is often a priori
assumed) to the ground state of the system. The CCD
electronic-correlation energy is then calculated as a cer-
tain linear function of the converged t2 amplitudes (the
t(1)
amplitudes correspond to the second-order MP cor-
2
relation energy and will be, after Ref. 12, referred to as
the MP2 amplitudes). The above treatment applies also
to the ACP and ACPQ equations. In annulenes one may
also use a kind of analytical-continuation procedure to
ﬁnd the standard solution for those values of parame-
ter β for which the standard procedure (starting from
the MP2 amplitudes) does not converge: one uses as the
starting point the converged t2 amplitudes found for the
suﬃciently close β value.

The multiple solutions of the CCD, ACP, and ACPQ
equations presented in this paper were found in a quasi-
random manner, by generating a pool of the initial t2

amplitudes and then applying the DIIS procedure. The
starting pool included the results of several hundred con-
verged CCD, ACP, and ACPQ calculations obtained for
diﬀerent β values and for diﬀerent forms of function γ(R)
(these sets of t2 amplitudes indeed looked random). Most
of the calculations starting from this quasi-random am-
plitudes either diverge, or converge to the standard so-
lution, but in some cases a new solution is obtained.
Certainly, this is not a very eﬃcient method of ﬁnding
the multiple solutions, but since a single CCD calcula-
tion for [10]annulene usually takes only several seconds,
a lot of data may be generated that way. We have found
that the strongly correlated regime (β > −1.5 eV) is
rich in multiple solutions, while in the weakly correlated
regime (β < −3.0 eV) practically only the standard so-
lution could be reached that way. Therefore, we per-
formed calculations for several values of β from interval
(−1.0 eV, 0 eV). These results were then extended as
far as possible by a careful application of our analytical-
continuation procedure. The obtained results are not
supposed to provide the complete set of real solutions
for [10]annulene. Nevertheless, they provide a rather in-
triguing glimpse at the “tip of the iceberg” of the multiple
solution problem for this system. Let us note that the
multiple solutions of the ACP and ACPQ equations have
never been studied before.

III. RESULTS

In Figs. 1–3 we present the electronic-correlation ener-
gies corresponding to the multiple solutions of the CCD,
ACP, and ACPQ equations, respectively. These results
are obtained within the PPP-MN model for −5.0 eV ≤
β < 0 eV, each solution is represented by a continuous
line. The line endpoints (not touching the graph’s bound-
aries) indicate the limiting β values corresponding to our
analytical-continuation procedure. It is seen that some of
the new solutions exist for a very broad range of β, while
some can be continued only within a very narrow inter-
val. The ground-state FCI correlation energies, shown
as the broken line, are provided for a reference. The so-
lution line that approaches the FCI line in the weakly
correlated regime corresponds to the standard solution
discussed in the previous papers [8, 12].

The CCD results in Fig. 1 are rather simple: The
standard-solution line is the only extending for all the
β values.
(When the standard iteration procedure is
combined with the DIIS technique, the standard CCD
solution for [10]annulene can be obtained for all nega-
tive values of β, as shown previously by Paldus et al. [8]
by using the Newton-Raphson method.) In the strongly
correlated regime (β > −1.5 eV), the standard CCD solu-
tion provides a rather poor approximation to the ground
state, and the corresponding correlation energy falls well
below the FCI line. Other solutions have the energies
higher than the FCI result, some of them may represent
excited states. Most of them can be found only in the

proximity of β = 0, where the quasidegeneracy eﬀects
are the strongest.

The ACP and ACPQ results (Figs. 2 and 3 respec-
tively) display a diﬀerent and more complicated behav-
ior. Unlike the CCD standard solution, the ACP and
ACPQ standard solutions stay close to the FCI line also
in the strongly correlated regime (although the corre-

sponding t2 amplitudes show increasing deviations from
the FCI t2 amplitudes as β → 0 [12]). The ACP and
ACPQ standard solutions can be found for β < 0 by
applying the standard iteration procedure starting from
the MP2 amplitudes [12]. Quite a few nonstandard so-
lutions have been found, some of them extending for
the whole range of β. Quite unusual is the presence
of the solution lines lying below the standard-solution

line (the “underground” lines). Such exotic solutions
have been observed in the study of benzene [5]; however,
they were unstable in the DIIS iterative procedure (could
be found only by the homotopy method). The “under-
ground” solutions obviously have no physical meaning,
and it is a little disturbing that they may appear while
iteratively solving the ACP or ACPQ equations. One
of the ACPQ “underground-solution” lines is especially
peculiar: it starts with the lowest energy for β = 0 and
rises quite steeply with the decreasing β, crossing sev-
eral solution lines, including the standard-solution line
(apparently there is no “non-crossing rule” for diﬀerent
solution lines).

Quite intriguing are the solutions of the CCD equations
corresponding to the PPP-P model, displayed in Fig. 4
together with the ground-state FCI results. We were
able to ﬁnd only two solutions, hereafter referred to as
CCD1 (the standard solution) and CCD2 (the nonstan-
dard one). Despite the use of the extensive quasi-random
search, the CCD iterations invariably led to CCD1 or
CCD2 (these solutions were so strong attractors that the
iterations rarely diverged). In contrast to the CCD re-
sults for the PPP-MN model, the iterations starting di-
rectly from the MP2 amplitudes converge to the CCD1
solution in the weakly correlated regime, while in the
strongly correlated regime the CCD2 solution is obtained.
In Fig. 4 we mark by the squares the endpoints of the
respective direct-convergence domains. One may thus
obtain the CCD1 and CCD2 solutions in a determinis-
tic way, by starting the calculations within these regions.
Moreover, by applying our analytical-continuation proce-
dure, we are able to extend a given solution line outside
its domain of (direct) convergence.

The CCD1-solution line resembles closely the line cor-
responding to the standard CCD solution for the PPP-
MN model, see Fig. 1, while the CCD2 line has no coun-
terpart in that ﬁgure. The CCD1 and CCD2 lines cross
for β = −1.17479 eV, in the vicinity of the FCI-solution
line. In Table I we present the CCD1, CCD2, MP2 and
FCI correlation energies calculated for three representa-
tive β values, including the intersection coordinate. In
addition, we show there the values of parameters θ and η
which provide a measure of similarity between the vector
of t2 amplitudes corresponding to a given solution and
the vector of t2 amplitudes extracted from the linear co-

eﬃcients of the ground-state FCI wavefunction: θ is the
angle between the vectors, and η is the ratio of the vector
lengths (for details, see Ref. 12).

From Fig. 4 and Table I a consistent picture emerges:
The CCD1 solution provides an acceptable approxima-
tion to the ground-state FCI solution up to the vicin-
ity of the CCD1/CCD2 crossing; then, in the strongly-
correlated region, it deteriorates and hardly deserves the
name of the standard solution. The CCD2 solution, on
the other hand, starts as the “underground” in the weak
correlation regime (bearing no resemblance to the FCI so-
lution), but it improves in the strongly-correlated regime,
and, ﬁnally, becomes a slightly better (but still poor)
approximation to the FCI solution (the CCD2 correla-
tion energies are surprisingly similar to the FCI ones in
the strongly correlated regime). Thus, it looks as CCD1
and CCD2 swap their roles as the standard and “un-
derground” solutions. The behavior of the MP2 results
agrees with the observed convergence pattern for itera-
tions starting from the MP2 amplitudes. Interestingly,
if one performed a CCD study of the PPP-P model of
[10]annulene by applying a standard iteration procedure
(starting with the MP2 amplitudes) at some representa-
tive β values (say, −5.0, −2.5, −1.5, and −0.5 eV), the
conspicuous switch between the CCD1 and CCD2 solu-
tions would have been passed unnoticed. By looking at
the CCD correlation energies alone, one would then pro-
claimed a very good performance of the CCD method up
to very small β values, contrary to the results found by
Paldus et al. [8] for the PPP-MN model.

The study of the ACP and ACPQ equations in the
PPP-P model brings in some additional unexpected ﬁnd-
ings: the standard ACP solution cannot be found for β
between −0.80 and −0.4 eV, while the standard ACPQ
solution encounters problems already for β > −2.53 eV.
Apparently, in the strongly correlated regime of the PPP-
P model both methods become unstable.

Our search of the multiple real solutions of the CCD,
ACP, and ACPQ equations has brought several unex-
pected ﬁndings: (i) while solving the CC equations by
iterations, one may arrive at an “underground” solution,
(ii) in the PPP model, the character of multiple solutions
is sensitive to the form of the long-range potential (the
γ function), (iii) diﬀerent solutions may play the role of
the standard solution when the strength of the electronic-

correlation eﬀects is varied (this may apply to the changes
in molecular geometry, e.g., to the bond breaking). In
it seems that the problem of multiple solu-
conclusion:
tions of the CC equations deserves still more attention.
Some variants of our random-search approach may be

tried also on larger many-electron systems.

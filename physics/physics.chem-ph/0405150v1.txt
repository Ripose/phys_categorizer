Abstrat

A result from Dodd and Gibbs[1℄ for the seond virial oe(cid:30)ient of partiles in 1 dimension,

sub jet to delta-funtion interations, has been obtained by diret integration of the wave fun-

tions. It is shown that this result an be obtained from a phase shift formalism, if one also inludes

the ontribution of osillating terms. The result is important in work to follow, for the third virial

oe(cid:30)ient, for whih a similar formalism is being developed. We examine a number of (cid:28)ne points

in the quantum mehanial formalisms.

Introdution

The quantum mehanial formulation of virial oe(cid:30)ients, or the alulation of orretions to lassial

results, ontinues to be of onern. We note, for example, the fairly reent artile by Hussien and Yahia

[2℄, on the quantum orretions to the lassial fourth virial oe(cid:30)ient for square well potentials. Our

e(cid:27)orts are, instead, direted to the ontinuing development of a fully quantum mehanial formalism,

appliable to the higher virials, and espeially useful at low temperatures.

We reall that, many years ago, Dodd and Gibbs[1℄ were able to evaluate the seond and third

virial of idential partiles in one dimension, sub jet to repulsive delta funtion interations. To do

this, they introdued a omplete set of energy eigenfuntions in the traes, and then integrated to

obtain answers in terms of single and two-dimensional integrals.

Their original aim, as is lear from their paper and from Gibbs' thesis, was to obtain a formalism

in terms of the S-matrix, following the formalism of Dashen, Ma and Bernstein[3℄, in an e(cid:27)ort to

obtain the virials in terms of sattering quantities. This was not possible, as the authors determined

that the `formal limiting proesses are not valid for the singular amplitudes of this system'.

An alternative formalism, proposed by Larsen and Masheroni[4℄, aimed at expressing the higher

virials in terms of eigenphase shifts and bound state energies, and, if neessary, other on-shell prop-

erties, in a hyperspherial harmoni formalism. Under some onstraints, one is then able to reover

the lassial results for the 3rd virial, through a semi-lassial approximation[5℄. Low temperature

alulations have been arried out for repulsive potentials in 2 dimensions[6℄, and a more sophistiated

formalism, involving a hyperspherial adiabati basis, has been presented[7℄,

Our aim, in this and subsequent papers, is to use the exellent results of Dodd and Gibbs to on(cid:28)rm

our virial formalism for the seond and third virials, for this partiular dimension and interation, for

whih we have analytial and numerial results[8, 9, 10℄. More spei(cid:28)ally, in this short note, we will

show that, for the seond virial, the result of Dodd and Gibbs an be rewritten as an integral, over

the energy, of a Boltzmann fator together with the phase shift - the usual seond virial type of result

- plus that of an extra `osillating' type of term, partiular to the ontribution of even parity wave

funtions in one dimension. This situation is understood[11℄, though not neessarily widely, and we

disuss it for this partiular ase and in greater generality.

The Seond Virial Coe(cid:30)ient

Following ref. [7℄, in this setion we present the main steps leading us from the grand partition funtion

to the expression of the seond virial oe(cid:30)ient in terms of the asymptoti properties of the system.

Instead of using the Ursell expansion, we simply take, diretly, the logarithm of the grand partition

funtion.

The latter an be written as

Q =

znT r

βHn

The fugaity z equals exp (µ/kT ); β = 1/kT , where µ, k and T are the Gibbs' funtion per partile,
Boltzmann's onstant and the temperature, respetively. Hn and Tn are the n-partile Hamiltonian

indies ℓ and m. The integration over −→r is arried out over the redued range (half ) of −→ω , sine

this then yields all of the on(cid:28)gurations of the symmetrial wave funtions. These wave funtions are

A method, that has been used to evaluate the integral over k , is to put the system in a box of
volume V (see, for instane, ref. [4℄). The energies will then be disrete, haraterized by an index n,
and the eigenfuntions will be normalized so that their integral over the r gives 1. For large volumes,

we an again proeed from the sum to an integral in whih, to estimate the density of states

An integration by parts an hange the integral to involve the phase shifts diretly.

Osillatory Terms

The passage from the sum, in the box approximation, to the integral, in the ontinuum situation,

is usually perfetly justi(cid:28)ed. The orretion terms are negligible, exept under some very spei(cid:28)

irumstanes, as we shall see.

To investigate this, we follow a method[12℄ devised for the seond virial oe(cid:30)ient for anisotropi

interations, where it beomes impossible, in a box, to simultaneously satisfy a ommon boundary

ondition for all the amplitudes (belonging to di(cid:27)erent orbital angular momenta) of any given eigen-

funtion. It beame useful then, and elegant, to diretly evaluate the integral of the square of the

wave funtions that already appears (8) in our formulation for the symmetri ase. To do so requires

a simple 'Green's funtion trik'.

The Shrödinger equation for the radial wave funtion orresponding to k is

We note that our expression for the wave funtion is ompletely symmetri in all of our variables!

We have the hoie of either integrating over half of the x spae and the omplete k spae, or over
the omplete x spae and half of the k spae. We hoose to do the latter. For k positive, we (cid:28)rst
integrate, over x > 0, the square of the wave funtion. We an do this by using our Green's funtion

`trik' as we have done previously for 3 dimensions, but sine we know the expliit form of the wave

funtion in terms of its phase shift, it is tempting to evaluate the integral diretly!

Equivalene of the Results of Dodd and Gibbs.

In this setion we show that our formalism, and (23), gives us an equivalent result for the di(cid:27)erene

in the fugaity oe(cid:30)ients, to that obtained in ref.

[1℄. While the former was derived diretly from

the partition funtion and is expressed in terms of asymptoti quantities, the latter was derived using

the usual luster expansion [14℄ and is expressed in terms of integrals.

The derivative of the phase shift reads

dδ
dk

=

g
k2 + g 2

and, therefore, the integral of the phase shift term in Eq. (23) is

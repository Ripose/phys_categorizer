Abstract

−

We present analytical and numerical results for models of electrodeposition of ZnO
ﬁlms with organic additives, with a special focus on the growth of hybrid ﬁlms with
eosin Y. First we propose a rate equation model which assumes that the additives
form branches with an exposed part above the ZnO deposit. The branches grow
with larger rate than the pure ﬁlm, and it is assumed that the rate of production of
ZnO near them is proportional to the height exposed to the solution. This accounts
ions from the reduction of dissolved oxygen near those
for the generation of OH
branches and the reactions with Zn2+ ions to form ZnO molecules. The steady state
solution of this model shows both species growing with the rate of the branches,
and qualitatively explains their catalytic eﬀect. Subsequently, we propose a more
realistic statistical model which represents the basic features of the formation of
the hybrid deposits from Zn2+ ions, a hydroxide precursor and eosin in solution.
It avoids the description of the role of several species, such as the Zn2+ ions, by
using simple probabilistic rules for the reactions of eosin and oxygen, and takes
into account diﬀusion from solution along the same lines of the diﬀusion-limited
aggregation models. The catalytic eﬀect is represented by the preferencial produc-
tion of OH
ions near eosin branches, which form ZnO species. Simulations of the
model were performed with concentrations in solution corresponding to the typical
experimental values. It is shown that an improvement of the growth rate is possible
only with a rather large diﬀusion coeﬃcient of eosin in solution compared to that of
hydroxide precursors, which qualitatively agrees with experimental ﬁndings. In the
cases where a series of neighboring eosin clusters competitively grow,the increase in
the growth rate and the high eosin loading observed in the simulated deposits also
agree qualitatively with electrodeposition experiments.

1 Introduction

The growth of thin ﬁlms from solutions has emerged as an eﬃcient, low tem-
perature, versatile preparation route which can be used at large scale for the
production of high quality materials [1]. One of the interests of these methods
is the possibility of adding foreign soluble compounds to the deposition bath
and modulating ﬁlm properties by playing with the interactions which arise
between the growing ﬁlm and these compounds. Among the additives, organic
ones are of utmost interest since many of them have been shown to act as
templating agents and/or crystal growth directing agents, and in many cases
as functionalizing agents for the deposits.

These eﬀects are well-documented in the case of zinc oxide. This inorganic
compound has attracted much attention due to a broad range of potential high
technology applications such as surface acoustic wave ﬁlter [2], light emitting
diodes [3], lasers [4], varistors [5], gas sensors [6] and solar cells [7]. ZnO can
be prepared as a thin ﬁlm by chemical deposition methods [8,9] or by elec-
trodeposition [10,11,12,13,14,15]. The dramatic eﬀects of organic additives on
ﬁlm structures and morphologies have been reported with both deposition
routes. For instance, in the presence of citrate, chemically deposited ZnO are
formed of stacked nanoplates assembled in a biomimetic manner [9]. However
the most impressive morphological changes have been observed in electrode-
posited zinc oxide. In the presence of sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS), the for-
mation of lamellar nanostructures has been shown [16,17]. The SDS can be
removed from the ﬁlm and highly porous thin ﬁlms are released [17]. Diﬀerent
dyes, such as eosin Y (EY) [18,19,20,21], ﬂuorescein (FL) [22], Tetrasulfonated
phthalocyanines (TSPc) [23,24,25,26] and riboﬂavin (RI) [27], have also been
shown to incorporate in the ﬁlm and to give rise to nanostructures. These
organic dyes contain negatively charged functions (carboxylate (EY, FL), sul-
fonate (TSPc) or phosphonate (RI) groups) which allow their direct binding
to the oxide crystal surface during the synthesis.

In many cases, it has also been shown that the organic component presents
catalytic properties for the deposition reactions. For instance, the ﬁrst step

The catalytic eﬀect has been observed in O2 reduction with EY [20], TSPc
[26], SDS [17], whereas EY has also been shown to catalyze the H2O2 reduction
[19].

However, while the eﬀects of additives in ﬁlm shaping are widely illustrated
in experimental works, particularly that of the organic ones, the exact role of
these compounds in the growth process remains to be clariﬁed in most cases.
The aim of the present work is to ﬁll this gap by proposing kinetic and statis-
tical models for zinc oxide electrodeposition in the presence of EY in solution,
which focus on a small number of basic features of those processes. The start-
ing point for this modeling is a series of experimental results, some of them
also observed in deposition with diﬀerent organic additives [17]. The singular
morphology of the zinc oxide ﬁlms prepared in the presence of EY, which has
been detailed elsewhere [20,21], shows large round shaped single crystals of
zinc oxide ﬁlled with self-assembled dye aggregates, as shown in Fig. 1. The
deposition potential must be suﬃciently negative for EY to be reduced upon
the deposition process. It is observed that the dye can be almost completely
removed by a soft chemical treatment [29,30] which reveals a network of in-
terconnected mesopores. They are connected to the surface and can be ﬁlled
with a solution. This network, formed during the synthesis from aggregated
dye molecules, acts as a template for the growth of ZnO.

Here, we will ﬁrstly introduce a simple rate equation model which explains
some features of a cooperative growth of a ZnO ﬁlm and additive aggregates.
This model is particularly useful for understanding the role of additive concen-
trations and diﬀusion coeﬃcients in the catalytic eﬀects. It will be discussed in

3

Sec. II. Subsequently, we will present a statistical model which represents the
main microscopic features of those processes by probabilistic rules of diﬀusion
and aggregation of some chemical species in solution and in the deposit. The
role of diﬀusion coeﬃcients and the calculated growth rates are in qualitative
agreement with experimental ﬁndings, as well as the structures of ZnO and
EY deposits. This stastitical model will be presented in Sec. III and the results
presented in Sec. IV. Finally, in Sec. V we summarize our results and present
our conclusions.

2 Rate equation model

This model aims at explaining basic kinetic features of the growth of ZnO
with organic additives with drastic simpliﬁcations of the ﬁlm structure.

First we assume that pure ZnO growth takes place with rate r0 (in nanometers
per second), due to reactions of type (4) near the ﬁlm surface. If the average
volume occupied by one molecule is V , then r0/V is the growth rate per unit
area in that case. Even in the presence of the additives, the roughness of the
ZnO ﬁlm surface will be neglected.

When the additive is present, we assume that it forms straight structures
which grow from the electrode, as shown in Fig. 2. The total number of linear
branches of the additive is N0, which depends on the nucleation of the additive
at the electrode surface in the beginning of the growth process. Each branch
is assumed to grow with rate rA if it is not covered by the ZnO deposit
(rA > r0), so that the height of each branch increases as H = rAt. rA is
expected to increase with the concentration ρA and the diﬀusion coeﬃcient
DA of the additive in solution, but the exact dependence on those quantities
will not be important at this point.

−

In order to represent the catalytic eﬀect of the additive, we assume that an
excess of OH
is produced near the eosin braches, which leads to the produc-
tion of ZnO at those regions. The rate of production of ZnO is expected to be
proportional to the length of those branches which is exposed above the ﬁlm
surface, (H
h) (see Fig. 2), where h is the ZnO ﬁlm height. Consequently,
the total rate of production of ZnO molecules near the additive branches is
h), where k is a reaction constant. A constant reaction rate in this
N0k (H
model accounts for the assumption that the oxygen reduction reaction is not
under diﬀusion control. Also, it is assumed that the ZnO molecules immedi-
ately precipitate and aggregate to the ﬂat ﬁlm surface, leaving the branches
uncovered.

Under these conditions, if the area of the ﬁlm is A, then the number of ZnO

Here, the ﬁrst contribution in the right hand side comes from the reactions

It gives a constant growth rate rA for the deposit at long times, with 1/a being
the characteristic time of decay. It means that the ﬁlm growth rate attains
the same growth rate of the branches in the steady state: while the rate of
production of ZnO near the ﬁlm surface is r0 < rA, the exposed height of the
branches attains a suﬃciently high value H
to produce an excess
of ZnO molecules in their neighborhood. However, the diﬀerence H
h is
rAt in the long time limit, so that the
much smaller than the ﬁlm height h
≈
growth rate of the deposit (rA) does not depend on N0, which is determined
by the nucleation process. This nontrivial result comes from the fact, as N0
increases, the steady state regime is more rapidly attained (1/a decreases),
with a smaller exposed height of the branches.

h = rA−r0

Now let us consider the eﬀect of the additive concentration in solution, ρA,
assuming that its diﬀusion coeﬃcient is constant (constant temperature con-
ditions). Since r0 only represents the reactions occurring near the ﬁlm surface,
it is expected to be constant as ρA increases. On the other hand, the growth
rate of the branches, rA, is some monotonically increasing function of rA(ρA).
For low concentrations, rA is small, consequently the branches will be covered
by ZnO. Quantitatively, this is the case where rA (ρA) < r0, which implies
ρA < ρc, where ρc is a critical concentration of additive such that rA (ρc) = r0.
For higher concentrations, we have rA > r0 and the above solution of the rate
equation model is valid.

The dependence of the growth rate on the additive concentration is qualita-
tively shown in Fig. 3, with the simple assumption that rA linearly increases
with ρA, as a signature of a ﬁrst order reaction in the growth of EY. This
result is in qualitative agreement with the ﬁndings of Ref. [19] for ZnO/EY

5

electrodeposition with an hydrogen peroxide oxygen precursor, where a signif-
icant increase of growth rate was observed only for EY concentrations above
2µM. However, no well-deﬁned plateau in the growth rate is observed in elec-
trodeposition with molecular oxygen precursor [31], but an increase in the
growth rate even for small additive concentrations. This is probably due to
nucleation features that are not properly represented in the present simpliﬁed
model.

For very high concentrations of additives, there will be deviations from the
behavior shown in Fig. 3. Since the concentration of oxygen precursor is ﬁnite,
its diﬀusion limits the current towards the electrode, thus it is expected that
the growth rate will eventually saturate.

The main parameters of the rate equation model are the growth rates rA
and r0, which depend on several parameters, such as concentrations of oxygen
precursors and additives in solution, zinc ions concentration and the respective
diﬀusion coeﬃcients. However, the model leads to two important conclusions.
First, in order that the catalytic eﬀect is observed, it is necessary that rA > r0,
consequently the concentration and the diﬀusion coeﬃcient of the additive in
solution must be combined in a suitable way to fullﬁll this condition. Secondly,
if the additive branches are able to grow above the ﬁlm surface, then the ﬁlm
1/a in
growth rate is the same of those branches in the stationary state (t
Eq. 7), independently of the rate of pure ZnO ﬁlms growth. These conclusions
will guide the simulation work on the microscopic model.

3 Microscopic model

Now we present a more complete model for the electrodeposition of ZnO
with organic additives, in which the physical properties of diﬀerent species
in solution and in the deposit are taken into account. This is particularly
important to understand the role of diﬀusion coeﬃcients and to predict the
structure of the deposit, as well as to perform quantitative comparisons with
experimental data. At the latter point, we will basically refer to ZnO/EY
ﬁlms data available, thus the presentation of the model will be inspired by
this growth process.

We will consider a lattice model with two species executing random walks
in solution and two species forming a deposit grown above a ﬂat electrode.
All lengths will be given in lattice units. Due to the relative complexity of
this model, it will be solved by simulation. A two-dimensional version will be
discussed, which we expect to capture the main features of the real process,
at the same time of being amenable for computation.

The species in the solution, O and E, represent the hydroxide precursor (O2
or H2O2) and eosin Y, respectively. Their diﬀerent sizes, as shown in Fig. 4a,
qualitatively account for the diﬀerent masses and radius. Their auto-diﬀusion
coeﬃcients are DO and DE, i. e. each O (E) in solution executes DO (DE)
random movements of unit size per unit time. These rates set the time scale
of our model.

The deposit will be formed by two aggregated species, named ZA and EA,
representing respectively the ZnO and the eosin Y molecules in the ﬁlm, as
shown in Fig. 4b. For simplicity, their sizes are the same as those of the species
in solution.

Although the zinc and hidroxide ions play an essential role in the reactions
leading to the formation of ZnO (Eqs. 1, 2 and 4), they will not be explicitely
represented in our model. Instead, their eﬀects will be described by probabil-
ities of removing O particles from the solution and producing new aggregated
particles, thus avoiding the complications of the explicit representation of the
above mentioned reactions. Following this reasoning, the growth process is
EA, which can
represented by the simpliﬁed reactions O
take place with given probabilities and under conditions that are related to
the neighborhood of the particles in solution.

ZA and E

→

The growth process begins with a ﬂat electrode (a line of length L) and a
solution with concentrations ρO and ρE of O and E particles, respectively.

EA) occurs when that particle
The aggregation of an E particle (reaction E
has a nearest neighbor of a previously aggregated EA (Fig. 5a) or when it has
a nearest neighbor site belonging to the electrode (the initial substrate). The
new EA particle permanently sticks at the position where it is formed. The
contact of E particles with ZA sites never generates EA particles, which is a
key hypothesis for explaining the formation of continuous ﬁbers of eosin Y in
the ﬁlms.

→

→

The reaction O
ZA occurs upon contact of a particle O with ZA or EA.
When the O particle has a neighbor site ZA or a neighbor site belonging to the
electrode (initial substrate), the reaction occurs with probability p, otherwise
the O particle remains in the solution. When the O particle has a neighboring
EA, that reaction occurs with probability 1. These rules are illustrated in Fig.
5b.

Contrary to the EA particles, ZA particles are allowed to precipitate and dif-
fuse on the ﬁlm surface after their formation. In order to represent the main
features expected for this process and save computational time, a simple diﬀu-
sion mechanism will be mimicked immediately after the ZA particle is created:
it precipitates to the topmost empty site of its current column, searches for the
point with the highest number of nearest neighbors ZA whithin a certain ra-

7

dius R (deﬁned below), and permanently sticks at that point. These processes
are illustrated in Fig. 5c.

The above stochastic rules are motivated by some experimental features of
the ZnO/EY ﬁlms growth. The rules for formation of EA particles represent
the initial nucleation of EY at the electrode and the subsequent formation
of EY clusters upon reduction of the molecules that reach the ﬁlm surface.
Since EA is not formed upon contact of E with ZA, there will be no isolated
EA particle in the ZA matrix, which accounts for the fact that almost all
EY can be removed from the hybrid ﬁlms [29,30]. As regards the formation
of ZA particles, the higher probability of occurrence after contact of O with
EA follows from the assumption that oxygen precursors reduction is enhanced
near the eosin clusters, which facilitates the formation of ZnO in those regions.

For the diﬀusion of a ZA particle on the ZnO ﬁlm surface after its formation,
we consider a surface diﬀusion coeﬃcient DA, which gives a radius for searching
the ﬁnal aggregation position as R = √DAτ , where τ is the current average
time for one layer deposition. This time is updated during the simulation,
while DA is kept ﬁxed. The condition to choose the ﬁnal aggregation point
follows the same ideas of the Wolf-Villain model for thin ﬁlm deposition [32],
and are reasonable for formation of a crystalline structure due to the trend of
increasing the binding energy.

The height of the solution above the ﬁlm surface is kept constant during the
simulation of the growth process. New particles (O or E) are left at random
positions of the top layer of the solution immediately after an aggregation
event (rections E
ZA), in order to maintain constant concentra-
tions. This height was 300 lattice units in our simulations. The diﬀusion layer
near the ﬁlm surface, in which concentrations of O and E were reduced, was of
order of 100 lattice units or less. These conditions are reasonable to represent
experiments in which a rotating disk electrode was used, thus avoiding the
growth of the diﬀusion layer and the subsequent decrease of the growth rate.

EA, O

→

→

We recall that the rules for aggregation of E particles are the same of the
original diﬀusion-limited aggregation (DLA) model of Witten and Sander [33],
in which growth took place from a single seed. Extensions to the case of an
initial ﬂat surface were also considered by several authors [34,35,36,37], but in
the present model the cooperative growth with the ZA layer plays a remarkable
role, as will be shown below.

4 Results for the microscopic model

In all simulations presented here, we considered DO = 1, and in most cases
the lattice lenghts are L = 512 and the diﬀusion coeﬃcient of aggregated ZA
is DA = 0.005. Some data for L = 2048 were also collected in order to search
for possible ﬁnite-size eﬀects, mainly when the thickest deposits were grown.
In experiments, the maximum ratio of concentrations of eosin and hydroxide
precursor in solution is in the range 10−3
10−2, thus in this model we worked
−
with ratios between 0 (no eosin) and 10−2.

The results of the rate equation model of Sec. II suggest that the growth rate
rA of the additive (eosin) is proportional to ρEDE, while the growth rate of the
pure ZnO deposit, r0, is proportional to pρODO. In the following simulation
results, the model parameters will be tuned in the light of these relations and
the conclusions of the model of Sec. II, which predicted the beneﬁcial eﬀect of
the additive branches when rA > r0.

and ρE = 5
electrode surface, but they are rapidly covered by the ZA layer. Subsequently,
there is no possibility for uptaking other eosin molecules in the ﬁlm, then the
ﬁnal growth rate is determined by ZA aggregation. The accumulation of a
large density of O particles near the ﬁlm surface in Fig. 6 is justiﬁed by the
small aggregation probability p and the reduced eﬀective diﬀusivity near this
boundary.

Subsequently, we assumed that E particles had a signiﬁcantly large diﬀusion
coeﬃcient, DE = 1, which is equal to the coeﬃcient of Z. In Figs. 7a, 7b and 7c,
10−2,
we show the time evolution of a region of a deposit grown with ρO = 2
10−4 and p = 10−3. Although many EA particles attach to the elec-
ρE = 2
trode in the beginning of the process, they frequently become covered by ZA
particles after some time, even with a small probability of O-ZA aggregation.
However, the growth process is improved when clusters of EA particles suc-
ceed to grow (one of these clusters is shown in Figs. 7a-7c). When compared
to the case without E particles, the average height of the deposit increases
more than twice near those clusters, for the same time of growth.

×

These features are closer to the experimental ones for ZnO/EY ﬁlms, but
the average distance between the surviving branches is large, which leads to

9

a very large surface roughness at long lengthscales. This roughness rapidly
increases in time due to the very diﬀerent growth rates of diﬀerent regions of
the deposit: mounds growing with large rates are separated by long valleys
which slowly grow. Again, we also tested smaller concentrations of ρO, but
keeping the relative concentration between E and O ﬁxed (10−2). The growth
of EA branches are even more diﬃcult in these cases, for the same values of p.
Larger values of p, such as p = 10−2, eventually produce surface features like
those shown in Fig. 7, but the distance between the growing mounds is still
larger.

Now we consider the case DE = 2, in which small concentrations of E particles
are able to improve the growth process with the creation of a large number of
nucleation centers in the eletrode, the formation of a large number of branches
and a competition between them as the deposit grows, as well as a much
smaller surface roughness. The formation of an eosin interconnected network
inside the ZnO matrix is in agreement with main features of the nanostructure
observed experimentally.

×

10−3, ρE = 5

Fig. 8 illustrates the beginning of the growth of a region of a deposit with
10−5, DA = 0.05 and p = 0.25. The average height
ρO = 5
×
106 (Fig. 8c) is nearly 3 times larger than the height of the ﬁlm
for t = 3
grown without E particles during the same time, and the eosin loadings in
the deposits (ratio between number of EA particles and ZA particles) of Figs.
8a-8c increase from 0.64% to 0.85%. Simulation at longer times show sthat
these quantities attain diﬀerent steady state values, so that the features of
Fig. 8 may be interpreted as typical of the initial growth process.

One interesting point revealed in Fig. 8 is the competition between the growing
EA clusters. The central cluster of Figs. 8a and 8b grew slower than the
neighboring ones and, consequently, was covered by particles ZA in Fig. 8c,
while the larger surviving clusters created more branches.

×

107 with the same
In Fig. 9 we show a region of a deposit grown until t = 2
parameters of those in Fig. 8, except that DA = 0.01. The surface roughness
is larger in this case due to the inhomogeneous growth of EA branches and
smaller diﬀusion coeﬃcient of aggregated particles. However, other quantities
are not much diﬀerent from those obtained with DA = 0.05, such as the growth
rate at steady state conditions, which is nearly 3.3 times larger than the rate
of ﬁlm grown without E particles. It clearly shows the catalytic eﬀect of the
eosin clusters. Another important quantity is the EA loading in the ﬁlm, which
is nearly 2%. This is a high value compared to the relative concentration of
1% in solution.

Here it is interesting to point out that the conﬁgurations of EA branches are
similar to those encountered in a model of diﬀusion-controlled deposition by

10

Burlatsky et al [37], whose growth mechanisms are the same adopted for the
E particles in our model. However, while the screening process of the larger
clusters was the only reason for small clusters to stop growing in their model,
here this eﬀect is enhanced by the deposition of ZA particles, which may
eventually cover an EA cluster and suppress its growth (see e. g. Fig. 8c).

The above results show that a realistic description of the growth of ZnO/EY
ﬁlms must take into account a remarkably large diﬀusion coeﬃcient for eosin
in solution. This was indeed observed experimentally with the help of Levich
plots: the diﬀusion coeﬃcient of O2 and EY were 3.4
×
10−5cm2s−1, respectively, in the classical deposition condition of the ﬁlms,
that is at 70oC and in chloride medium [19]. This gives a ratio 2.4 between
diﬀusion coeﬃcients, while the ratio between the masses of EY and O2 is
near 20. Although the experimental data suggests the use ofDO/DE
2.4 in
our model, we believe that a quantitative comparison with those data would
require the analysis of wider ranges of the statistical parameters and a detailed
description of processes such as the nucleation of eosin centers at the electrode
and surface diﬀusion.

10−5cm2s−1 and 1.4

The order of magnitude of the growth rate increase in the ﬁlms of Figs. 8 and
9, when compared to the ﬁlms without EA particles, is also consistent with
experiments: a factor 3 was obtained in Ref. [19], with hydrogen peroxide as
the oxygen precursor, when ρE/ρO = 10−3, while a factor 5.5 was obtained
in Ref. [31], with molecular oxygen precursor, when ρE/ρO = 10−2. Moreover,
the high eosin loading of 2.1% was observed in the latter experiments [31],
which also agrees with the predictions of our model.

Finally, we recall that the rules of the model were proposed so that all EA
branches are connected to the electrode - see the images in Figs. 7, 8 and 9.
At long times, it is also observed that most EA particles belong to some of
the branches which are exposed above the ﬁlm surface - see Figs. 8 and 9.
Accordingly, a small fraction of EA particles is hidden in the deposit. This
also agrees with the experimental ﬁnding that eosin can be almost completely
removed by a soft chemical treatment of the hybrid ﬁlms [29,30].

5 Conclusion

We proposed a rate equation model and a microscopic statistical model to rep-
resent some features of ZnO electrodeposition with organic additives, mainly
focusing the application to electrodeposition with eosin Y.

The rate equation model assumes the formation of branches of the additive
which are extended above the ﬁlm surface, and is useful to understand the

11

basic features of the growth process. Under conditions that the branches grow
faster than the pure ZnO deposit, it was shown that both structures grow
with the growth rate of the former.

With the statistical model, we were able to reproduce several qualitative fea-
tures of the electrodeposition of ZnO/EY ﬁlms by assuming that it may be
viewed as a diﬀusion-limited aggregation process with an interplay between
diﬀerent chemical species in solution and a catalytic eﬀect of the eosin clusters
for the formation of ZnO. Among the predictions of the model, it is important
to mention: 1) the requirement of particularly large diﬀusion coeﬃcients of EY
in solution, so that it is able to improve the growth process with small concen-
trations, which is in qualitative agreement with experiments; 2) the formation
of branches of EY connected to the surface and ﬁlling the ﬁlm structure with-
out signiﬁcant large scale inhomogeneities; 3) the increase in relative growth
rates and the high EY loadings, which also agree with experimental results.
Consequently, we believe that this model incorporated most of the basic fea-
tures of the ZnO electrodeposition with EY, and may be extended in order to
provide quantitatively good results or to represent related growth processes.

We present photoabsorption oscillator strengths for C3H6 molecules with emphasis on the diﬀerence between
isomers, cyclopropane and propylene. We use an iterative numerical method based on the time-dependent local
density approximation with continuum, which we have recently developed. The oscillator strengths for the two
isomers diﬀer at photon energies above their ionization thresholds. The magnitude and the shape of the oscillator
strength distribution are in good agreement with recent experiments. The diﬀerences between the isomers arise
from diﬀerence in symmetry of electronic states and diﬀerent behaviors of continuum excitations.

1. Introduction

The photoabsorption and photoionization cross
sections of molecules are of signiﬁcant interest in
many ﬁelds of both fundamental and applied sci-
ences. The oscillator strength distribution char-
acterizing the optical response is the most impor-
tant quantity in understanding the interaction of
photon with electrons in atoms, molecules, and
matters. The oscillator strength distribution in
the whole spectral region has been extensively
studied with the advanced synchrotron radiation
and the high resolution electron energy loss spec-
troscopy [1,2]. In order to see how the oscillator
strength changes with varying molecular struc-
tures, it is useful to study isomer molecules. Since
the isomers consist of the same kind and the same
number of atoms, we expect similarity of the os-
cillator strengths at high photon energies. This
is because the molecular structure has little in-
ﬂuence on the excitation of inner core electrons.
However, the valence photoabsorption may diﬀer
according to the diﬀerence of electronic states be-
tween the isomers. In fact, Koizumi et al. have
observed a prominent distinction for the cross sec-
tions of simple hydrocarbon isomers, C3H6 (cy-
clopropane and propylene), at photon energies of

10 − 20 eV [3]. The photoabsorption and pho-
toionization data of cyclopropane in this energy
region were later improved by a measurement
with metallic thin ﬁlm windows [4]. These works
clearly show that the oscillator strengths have dif-
ferent peaks and shoulders depending on the iso-
mers in a continuous spectral region above the
ionization potentials (IPs).

Theoretical investigation for the isomer eﬀect
of C3H6 has been demanded for a long time,
however, none has been reported so far. This is
due to diﬃculties in treatment of the electronic
continuum in a non-spherical multicenter poten-
tial. There are several methods which are able
to take into account correlations among valence
electrons in the continuum [5,6,7,8,9]. Neverthe-
less, some of them are not suitable for calculat-
ing detailed structures of the spectra, and some
are diﬃcult to be applied to large molecules. We
have recently developed an alternative theoreti-
cal method for this purpose [10]. The method
is based on the time-dependent local-density ap-
proximation (TDLDA) in a grid representation of
the three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate, and
utilizes the Green’s function to take account of
the continuum boundary condition. We use it-
erative methods to solve linear algebraic equa-
tions for construction of the dynamical screen-
ing ﬁeld above the ﬁrst IP. The theoretical back-

2

ground of our method is similar to the one of
Ref. [5] in which the authors used a single-center
expansion technique. However, the application
was limited to small axially symmetric molecules,
because of diﬃculties in the single-center expan-
sion. Our method is based on direct calculation
of the self-consistent screening potential in the
three-dimensional grid representation, which does
not rely on the expansion and requires no spatial
symmetry.

In the present Letter, we report the valence
photoabsorption of the C3H6 isomers studied
with the continuum TDLDA method in Ref. [10],
and would like to show the power of the method.
Then, we give an interpretation of the continuous
spectra and elucidate origins of the isomer eﬀects.

2. Theory and computational method

Optical response of molecules is characterized
by the oscillator strength, denoted as df /dω in
the followings, which is given by

where the transition density δnν is related to the
Fourier component of a time-dependent exter-
nal dipole perturbation in ν-direction, Vν (ω) =
rν , through a complex susceptibility (δnν (ω) =
χ(ω)Vν (ω)).

The TDLDA describes a spin-independent N -
electron system in terms of the time-dependent
Kohn-Sham equations. Correlations among elec-
trons are taken into account through deforma-
tions of the self-consistent Kohn-Sham potential.
Linearizing the Kohn-Sham potential with re-
spect to the transition density, we obtain

Here, φi’s are the ground-state Kohn-Sham or-
bitals and G is the Green’s function for an elec-
tron in the static Kohn-Sham potential. In order
to properly treat the electronic continuum, the
outgoing boundary condition must be imposed on
G. Construction of the Green’s function is easily
done for a rotationally invariant potential V0(r),
using the partial wave expansion [11]. Thus, we
split the Kohn-Sham potential into two parts,
a long-range spherical part, V0(r), and a short-
range deformed part, ˜V (r) = VKS(r) − V0(r).
First, we construct the Green’s function, G0, for
the spherical potential V0, then, G can be ob-
tained from an identity

G = G0 + G0 ˜V G.

(4)

We solve Eqs. (2), (3), and (4) simultaneously
in the uniform grid representation of the three-
dimensional real space. Equations (2) and (4)
are linear algebraic equations with respect to δn
and G, respectively, for which an iterative method
provides an eﬃcient algorithm for the numeri-
cal procedure. We adopt the generalized con-
jugate residual method for these non-hermitian
problems. We would like to refer the reader to
Ref. [10] for detailed discussion of the methodol-
ogy and the theoretical background.

The exchange-correlation potential

is a sum
of the local density part given by Ref.
[13],
µ(PZ)[ρ], and the gradient correction of Ref. [14],
µ(LB)[ρ, ∇ρ], which will be abbreviated to LB po-
tential. This gradient correction is constructed so
as to reproduce the correct Coulomb asymptotic
behavior of the potential (−e2/r) and to describe
the Rydberg states. It was also pointed out that
the LB potential is necessary to reproduce the ex-
citation energies of high-lying bound states in the
TDLDA [15]. In our previous work [10], we have
also found for simple molecules that the TDLDA
with the LB potential reasonably accounts for res-
onances embedded in the continuum.

3. Results and discussion

3.1. Ground-state properties

We ﬁx the geometry of nuclei optimized for
the ground state. This is based on a semiem-
pirical method known as PM3 [12]. We only
treat valence electrons in the TDLDA calculation.
Thus, we use the norm-conserving pseudopoten-
tial [16] with a separable approximation [17] for
the electron-ion potentials. The coordinate space
is discretized in a square mesh of 0.3 ˚A and we
adopt all the grid points inside a sphere of 6 ˚A
radius. This results in a model space of 33,401
grid points.

First, we calculate the ground state of cyclo-
propane and propylene by solving the Kohn-Sham
equations with the exchange-correlation potential
of µ(PZ) + µ(LB). The LB potential µ(LB) contains
a parameter β [14], and we adjust this value to
make eigenvalues of the highest occupied molecu-
lar orbitals (HOMO) coincide with the empirical
vertical IPs (10.54 eV for cyclopropane [18] and
9.91 eV for propylene [19]). The occupied va-
lence orbitals in the ground state calculated with
β = 0.015 are listed in Table 1. The HOMO
eigenvalues are well reproduced for both isomers.
Propylene has a geometry of the Cs point group
while cyclopropane has the D3h group. Although

these isomers possess equal number of valence
electrons (eighteen valence electrons), the elec-
tron conﬁguration of cyclopropane is more degen-
erate in energy because of the higher symmetry.

3.2. Photoabsorption oscillator strength

Now we calculate the photoresponse of the iso-
mers. We use complex frequencies, ω + iΓ/2 with
Γ = 0.5 eV. The Γ plays a role of a smoothing pa-
rameter to make the energy resolution ﬁnite. This
also helps a convergence of the numerical itera-
tion procedure [10]. In Figs. 1 and 2 respectively,
we show the calculated photoabsorption oscillator
strength, df /dω, for cyclopropane and propylene
in a frequency (photon energy) range of 8−50 eV.
The calculations have been done with a frequency
mesh of ∆ω = 0.25 eV for a region of 8 ≤ ω ≤ 20
eV, and with ∆ω = 0.5 eV for the rest of fre-
quencies. The oscillator strength distributions of
the isomers are nearly identical at ω & 22 eV.
This energy roughly corresponds to the ioniza-
tion energy of the lowest-lying σ orbital. The
df /dω monotonically decreases as the frequency
increases but has a large tail at high frequency.
This behavior of the high-frequency tail in df /dω
is one of the characteristics of the electronic ex-
citations in the continuum, which was also found
in our previous studies of simple molecules [10].

4

The molecular structure has a little inﬂuence on
the electronic continuum in this energy region
(ω & 22 eV).

In contrast, in the frequency region below 22
eV, diﬀerent structures are observed among the
isomers. The df /dω of propylene shows a single
broad peak at ω = 13 ∼ 18 eV with small wig-
gles. On the other hand, distinctive three peaks
at ω = 11.8, 13.5, and 15.7 eV, are found in cy-
clopropane. This diﬀerence exactly matches the
experimental ﬁndings of the isomer eﬀect (the
thin solid line in Fig. 1 (a)). The energy posi-
tions of calculated peaks are lower than the ex-
perimental ones by about 1.5 eV. This is also
true for propylene in Fig. 2 (a),
in which the
broad peak is shifted to lower energy by 1.5 eV
compared to the experiment. We would like to
if we treat the electrons as re-
mention that,
sponding independently to the external dipole
ﬁeld, we cannot reproduce the main feature of
the oscillator strength distributions. We call this
approximation “independent-particle approxima-
tion (IPA)”, which corresponds to neglecting the
induced screening potential, the second term in
the bracket in Eq. (2). In Figs. 1 (a) and 2 (a),
the IPA calculations are shown by dashed lines.
The Thomas-Kuhn-Reiche (TRK) sum rule
tells us the integrated oscillator strength f (∞) =
18 in our calculations, since we only treat valence
electrons in C3H6. In Table 2, partial sum values
of the oscillator strengths are listed and compared
to the experiment. Again, the IPA calculation
cannot account for the data, while the TDLDA in
the continuum well agrees with the experiment.
Calculated total sum values for 8 < ω < 60 eV
are 16.2 for cyclopropane and 15.8 for propylene.
These values correspond to about 90 % of the
TRK sum rule for valence electrons.

3.3. Origin of the diﬀerence in photoab-

sorption between the isomers

We would like to discuss details of resonance
peaks and an origin of the diﬀerent behaviors be-
tween the isomers. First, let us compare the IPA
results for the two isomers (See dashed lines in
Figs. 1 (a) and 2 (a)).
In the energy region of
10 − 20 eV, although the bulk structure is similar,
cyclopropane shows a sharper main peak at 11.5

eV and an additional peak at 13 eV. This may
be due to higher-fold degeneracies in electronic
eigenstates in cyclopropane. These peak struc-
tures in cyclopropane remain after inclusion of
the dynamical screening eﬀects, while, for propy-
lene, the strong peak at 12 eV seen in the IPA
is diminished. Next, we shall examine this diﬀer-
ence in the dynamical screening eﬀects.

For this purpose, it is useful to calculate a par-
tial oscillator strength [11,10] which corresponds
to a contribution of each occupied orbital to the
total oscillator strength. We display the partial
df /dω in the energy range of 10 − 25 eV in Figs. 1
(b) and 2 (b). One can see that the major contri-
butions to df /dω come from bound-to-continuum
excitations of electrons near the Fermi level; the
HOMO (3e′)4 and the second HOMO (1e′′)4 in
case of cyclopropane, and the second (10a′)2, the
third (9a′)2 and the fourth HOMO (1a′′)2 for
propylene.

1)2 and (1a′′

The sharp peaks at 11.8 eV and 13.5 eV in cy-
clopropane originate from bound-to-bound tran-
sitions of (3a′
2 )2 electrons. These reso-
nances are also seen in the IPA calculation. Then,
the electron-electron correlation brings out coher-
ent contributions of bound-to-continuum excita-
tions of (3e′)4 and (1e′′)4 electrons. The width of
the resonances becomes slightly larger than that
of the IPA, because of the autoionization process.
The peak at 15.7 eV is also produced by coherent
excitations of (2e′)4 (bound-to-bound) and (3e′)4
(bound-to-continuum) electrons. We only see a
shoulder around 15.5 eV in the IPA calculation,
however, the dynamical eﬀect enhances the peak.
In the case of propylene, we ﬁnd several small
peaks of bound-to-bound excitations in the par-
tial df /dω in Fig. 2 (b). However, the bound-to-

continuum excitations, which mostly contribute
to the broad resonance in 13 − 18 eV, behave
rather independently, and do not produce coher-
ent enhancement of those peaks. As a result,
the small peaks in the bound-to-bound transi-
tions are mostly smeared out in the total oscil-
lator strength.

We think that this diﬀerence in the contin-
uum response could be attributed to the diﬀer-
ence in strength of bound-to-bound transitions.
The df /dω of propylene shows a typical behavior
of the dynamical screening eﬀects. Namely, the
oscillator strengths (and the peak at 12 eV) in
the IPA calculation are signiﬁcantly weakened by
the induced screening ﬁeld in Eq. (2). Conversely,
those at energies above 16 eV are enhanced. This
is because the real part of the dynamical polariz-
ability changes its sign at ω ≈ 16 eV, then the
screening ﬁeld changes into the “anti-screening
In the case of cyclo-
ﬁeld” at higher energies.
propane, the situation is slightly more compli-
cated. Generally speaking, the real part of the
dynamical polarizability changes its sign from
positive to negative at bound resonances. Since
the degeneracies of electronic orbitals are higher
in cyclopropane, the bound-to-bound transitions
have large oscillator strengths. Then, there ap-
pears a reminiscence of bound resonance in the
continuum region. The screening ﬁeld suddenly
drops down at energies corresponding to bound-
to-bound transitions. This provides eﬀective anti-
screening eﬀects to cause the peak structures in
the bound-to-continuum transitions.

Finally, we would like to comment on depen-
dence of our results upon the parameter β in the
LB potential µ(LB). A choice of this parame-
ter is rather arbitrary, since the value of β does

not change the Coulomb asymptotic behavior. In
fact, if we adopt β = 0.05, the value proposed by
the original paper [14], we obtain better agree-
ment to the photoabsorption spectra for both the
isomers. In the case of using β = 0.05, the Kohn-
Sham eigenvalues for occupied orbitals in cyclo-
propane are indicated as values in brackets in Ta-
ble 1. A binding energy of each orbital becomes
deeper by 1.3 − 1.5 eV, though spacings between
the orbitals almost stay constant. The calcu-
lated oscillator strength distribution is shown in
Fig. 3 for cyclopropane. The disagreement on the
peak positions are removed in the calculation. A
bound peak at 10 eV is also well reproduced in
the calculation. This peak consists of the exci-
tations of (3e′)4 and (1e′′)4 electrons. These ex-
citations have an almost identical energy when
we use β = 0.05, while the excitation of (1e′′)4
electrons is shifted to lower energy by 1 eV when
using β = 0.015. Except for the bound peak at
10 eV, the characteristic features of the oscilla-
tor strength distribution are not changed, and we
maintain the interpretation given above.

The oscillator strength distributions of C3H6
isomer molecules are studied with the TDLDA
in the continuum utilizing the three-dimensional
Cartesian coordinate representation. The calcu-
lation shows good agreement with experiments.
The oscillator strength in the energy region above
22 eV is almost identical among the isomers, how-
ever, diﬀerent peaks appear below that. This iso-
mer eﬀect is analysed by calculating the partial
oscillator strength of each occupied orbital.
In
addition to the diﬀerence in properties of bound
electronic orbitals, it turns out that bound-to-
continuum excitations of electrons near the Fermi
level behave diﬀerently between the isomers. The
bound-to-bound transitions in cyclopropane pos-
sess large strengths, and the bound-to-continuum
transitions exhibit coherent peak structures be-
cause of the anti-screening eﬀects. On the other
hand, in propylene, the bound-to-bound transi-
tions are too weak to produce the anti-screening
peaks for the continuum excitations. Although
the molecular structure directly has minor inﬂu-
ence on the continuum, the diﬀerence in bound-
to-bound transitions leads to variation in the dy-
namical screening eﬀects to change the continuum
excitations.

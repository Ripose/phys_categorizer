Abstract

From large basis set coupled cluster calculations and a minor empirical ad-

justment, an anharmonic force ﬁeld for silane has been derived that is con-

sistently of spectroscopic quality (±1 cm−1 on vibrational fundamentals) for

all isotopomers of silane studied. Inner-shell polarization functions have an

appreciable eﬀect on computed properties and even on anharmonic correc-

tions. From large basis set coupled cluster calculations and extrapolations

to the inﬁnite-basis set limit, we obtain TAE0=303.80±0.18 kcal/mol, which

includes an anharmonic zero-point energy (19.59 kcal/mol), inner-shell corre-

lation (−0.36 kcal/mol), scalar relativistic corrections (−0.70 kcal/mol), and

atomic spin-orbit corrections (−0.43 kcal/mol). In combination with the re-

cently revised ∆H ◦

f,0[Si(g)], we obtain ∆H ◦

f,0[SiH4(g)]=9.9±0.4 kcal/mol, in

I. INTRODUCTION

The spectroscopy and thermochemistry of the silane (SiH4) molecule have aroused in-

terest from a number of perspectives. Its importance as a precursor for the chemical vapor

deposition (CVD) of silicon layers has been discussed at length by Allen and Schaefer [1],

who also review early theoretical work on the molecule.

The spectroscopy of the tetrahedral group IV hydrides AH4 (A=C, Si, Ge, Sn, Pb) has

been extensively studied. For a review of early work on AH4 (A=Si, Ge, Sn) the reader is

referred to Ref. [2].

A complete bibliography on experimental work on methane and its isotopomers would

be beyond the scope of this work (see Refs. [3,4] for detailed references): we do note that an

accurate ab initio force ﬁeld was computed [3] by a team involving two of us. Based on this

force ﬁeld, a number of theoretical spectroscopic studies of the excited vibrational states of

CH4 were recently studied: we note in particular a full-dimenstional variational study by

Carter et al. [4], a low-order perturbation theoretical/resonance polyad study by Venuti et

al. [5], and a high-order canonical Van Vleck perturbation theory study by Wang and Sibert

[6]. We also note an accurate anharmonic force ﬁeld on the isoelectronic NH+

4 molecule by

two of us. [7]

The infrared spectrum of silane, SiH4, was ﬁrst studied in 1935 by Steward and Nielsen

[8] and a set of fundamental frequencies for the most abundant isotopomer was ﬁrst obtained

in 1942 by Nielsen and coworkers. [9]

The isotopomers of SiH4 have been the subject of considerable high-resolution experi-

mental work; for instance, we note [10,11] for 28SiH4, 29SiH4, 30SiH4, [12–14] for 28SiH3D,

[15,16] for 28SiHD3, and [17,18] for 28SiD4. The molecule is of considerable astrophysical

interest, having been detected spectroscopically in the atmospheres of Jupiter and Saturn

[19] and in the interstellar gas cloud surrounding the carbon star IRC+10 216 [20]

2

Until most recently, only fairly low-resolution data [21] were available for SiH2D2; as

the present paper was being prepared for publication, a high-resolution study [22] of the

{ν3, ν4, ν5, ν7, ν9} Coriolis resonance polyad appeared, in which assignments were facilitated

by mixed basis set CCSD(T) and MP2 calculations of the quartic force ﬁeld.

One of the interesting features of the infrared spectra of silane is their pronounced local-

mode character (e.g. [23]), leading to complex resonance polyads. The strongly ‘local’ char-

acter also inspired a study of the SiH4 spectrum up to seven quanta using algebraic methods

[24].

In the present work, we shall report a high-quality quartic force ﬁeld that is of constant

quality for all the isotopomers of silane. A theoretical spectroscopy study by Wang and

Sibert [25] is currently in progress on excited states and vibrational resonance polyads of

SiH4 and isotopomers, using high-order (6th and 8th) canonical Van Vleck perturbation

theory [26] and the force ﬁeld reported in the present work.

Since this can be done at very little additional computational expense, we shall also

report a benchmark atomization energy and heat of formation of SiH4. The thermodynamic

properties of silane are linked to a controversy concerning the heat of vaporization of silicon,

which is of fundamental importance to computational chemists since it is required every

time one attempts to directly compute the heat of formation of any silicon compound, be

it ab initio or semiempirically. ∆H ◦

f,0[Si(g)] is given in the JANAF tables [27] as 106.6±1.9

kcal/mol. Desai [28] reviewed the available data and recommended the JANAF value, but

with a reduced uncertainty of ±1.0 kcal/mol. Recently, Grev and Schaefer (GS) [29] found

that their ab initio calculation of the TAE of SiH4, despite basis set incompleteness, was

actually larger than the value derived from the experimental heats of formation of Si(g),

H(g), and SiH4(g). They concluded that the heat of vaporization of silicon should be revised

upwards to ∆H ◦

f,0[Si(g)]=108.07(50) kcal/mol, a suggestion supported by Ochterski et al.

[30]. Very recently, however, Collins and Grev (CG) [31] considered the scalar relativistic

contribution to the binding energy of silane using relativistic coupled cluster techniques

within the Douglas-Kroll [32] (no-pair) approximation, and found a contribution of -0.67

3

kcal/mol. This would suggest a downward revision of the GS value of ∆H ◦

f,0[Si(g)] to 107.4

kcal/mol, which is in excellent agreement with a recent redetermination by Martin and Taylor

[33] of 107.15±0.39 kcal/mol. (This latter value was derived by combining a benchmark ab

initio calculation of the total atomization energy of tetraﬂuorosilane, TAE0[SiF4], with a

very precise ﬂuorine bomb calorimetric measurement [34] of ∆H ◦

f [SiF4(g)].)

In addition, it was pointed out [29,31] that the JANAF value of ∆H ◦

f,0[SiH4(g)]=10.5±0.5

kcal/mol is in fact the Gunn and Green [35] value of 9.5±0.5 kcal/mol increased by a correc-

tion [36] of +1 kcal/mol for the phase transition Si(amorphous)→Si(cr). (Gunn and Green

considered this correction to be an artifact of the method of preparation and ignored it.)

Clearly, a calibration calculation of TAE0[SiH4] might be desirable, and is the secondary

purpose of the present study. Accurate thermochemical parameters of SiH4 (and other

silicon compounds) are of practical importance for the thermodynamic and kinetic modeling

of such processes as laser-induced chemical vapor deposition of silicon ﬁlms from silane [37],

the chemical vapor deposition of tungsten contacts for ULSI (ultralarge scale integrated

circuit) chips by SiH4 reduction of WF6 (e.g. [38]) and the generation of SiOxNy ﬁlms by

low-pressure chemical vapor deposition from mixtures of SiH4 with N2O and/or NH3 [39]

(e.g. as antireﬂective coatings [40] and for ultrathin capacitors [41]). (We also mention in

passing the use of silane compounds in dentistry [42].)

While GS’s work was deﬁnitely state of the art in its time, the attainable accuracy for

this type of compound may well have gone up an order of magnitude in the seven years

since it was published: in a recent systematic study [43] of total atomization energies of a

variety of ﬁrst-and second-row molecules for which they are precisely known, procedures like

the ones used in the present work achieved a mean absolute error of 0.23 kcal/mol, which

dropped to 0.18 kcal/mol if only systems well described by a single reference determinant

(as is the case with SiH4) were considered. In order to ascertain the utmost accuracy for

hydrides, a zero-point energy including anharmonic corrections was found to be desirable

[43]: this is obtained as a by-product of the accurate anharmonic force ﬁeld which is the

primary subject of the present contribution.

II. COMPUTATIONAL METHODS

All electronic structure calculations were carried out using MOLPRO 97 [44] running on

DEC Alpha and SGI Origin computers at the Weizmann Institute of Science.

The CCSD(T) [coupled cluster with all single and double substitutions (CCSD) [45] sup-

plemented with a quasiperturbative estimate of the contribution of connected triple excita-

tions [46]] method, as implemented in MOLPRO [47], was used throughout for the electronic

structure calculations on SiH4. For the Si(3P ) atom, we employed the deﬁnition of Ref. [48]

for the open-shell CCSD(T) energy.

The calculations including only valence correlation employed the standard Dunning cc-

pVnZ (correlation consistent valence n-tuple zeta [49]) basis sets on hydrogen and two dif-

ferent variants of the cc-pVnZ or aug-cc-pVnZ (augmented cc-pVnZ [50,51]) basis sets on

Si. The ﬁrst variant, cc-pVnZ+1, was used in the force ﬁeld calculations, and includes an

additional high-exponent d function [52] to accommodate the greater part of the inner-shell

polarization eﬀect, which is known to be important for both energetic and geometric prop-

erties of second-row molecules. [52,53] The second variant, aug-cc-pVnZ+2d1f [53], includes

two high-exponent d functions and a high-exponent f function, with exponents determined

by successively multiplying the highest exponent already present for that angular momentum

by a factor of 2.5. Such a set should give [53] an exhaustive account of the energetic eﬀects

of inner-shell polarization.

Calculations including inner-shell correlation (not to be confused with inner-shell po-

larization, which is an SCF-level eﬀect) were carried out using the Martin-Taylor [54] core

correlation basis set. Relativistic eﬀects were determined with the same basis set and as

ACPF (averaged coupled pair functional [55]) expectation values of the ﬁrst-order Darwin

and mass-velocity operators [56,57].

Optimizations were carried out by univariate polynomial interpolation. Force constants in

symmetry coordinates were determined by recursive application of the central ﬁnite diﬀerence

formula: the symmetry coordinates are deﬁned in the same way as in previous studies [3,7]

5

on the isovalent CH4 and NH+

4 molecules. The vibrational analyses were performed using a

modiﬁed version of the SPECTRO program [58,59] running on an IBM RS6000 workstation

at NASA Ames and the DEC Alpha at the Weizmann institute. The alignment conventions

for the anharmonic constants of a spherical top follow the work of Hecht [60] and general

formulae for these constants were taken from the paper by Hodgkinson et al. [61]. Similar

to previous work [3,62] on the spherical tops Be4 and CH4, the accuracy of the various

spectroscopic constants was veriﬁed by applying opposite mass perturbations of ±0.00001

a.m.u. to two of the hydrogen atoms, then repeating the analysis in the asymmetric top

formalism.

Finally, the reported zero-point energies include the E0 term [63] (which is the polyatomic

equivalent of the a0 Dunham coeﬃcient in diatomics).

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

A. Vibrational frequencies and anharmonic force ﬁeld

An overview of the basis set convergence of the computed bond distance, harmonic fre-

quencies, and vibrational anharmonic corrections is given in Table 1.

The eﬀect of adding inner-shell polarization functions to the cc-pVTZ basis set is modest

but signiﬁcant (0.006 ˚A) on the bond distance: the Si–H stretching frequencies, however,

are aﬀected by 20–25 cm−1. The bending frequencies are not seriously aﬀected: somewhat

surprising are the fairly strong eﬀects on the vibrational anharmonicities (including, to a

lesser extent, the bending frequencies). The overall behavior is in contrast to previous

observations [53] for SO2 in which the inner-polarization eﬀects on lower-order properties

like geometry and harmonic frequencies are very noticeable but those on anharmonicities

next to nonexistent, but is consistent with the very strong basis set sensitivity noted for the

ﬁrst three anharmonic corrections of the ﬁrst-row diatomic hydrides by Martin [64].

Likewise, a rather strong sensitivity with respect to basis set improvement from VDZ+1

over VTZ+1 to VQZ+1 is seen for the Si–H stretching frequencies and all the anharmonic-

6

ities, even as the harmonic bending frequencies appear to be close to converged with the

VTZ+1 basis set. It appears that in general, basis set sensitivity of anharmonicities of A–H

stretches is much more pronounced than that of A–B stretches.

The eﬀect of inner-shell correlation, while nontrivial for the purpose of accurate calcu-

lations, is quite a bit more modest than that of inner-shell polarization (as measured by

comparing the cc-pVTZ and cc-pVTZ+1 results), and in fact is not dissimilar to what one

would expect for a ﬁrst-row molecule (e.g. CH4 [3]).

We will now consider computed fundamentals for the various isotopomers of silane with

our best force ﬁeld, CCSD(T)/cc-pVQZ+1. All relevant data are collected in Table 2.

For 28SiH4, 29SiH4, and 30SiH4, agreement between the computed and observed funda-

mentals can only be described as excellent, with a mean absolute deviation of 2.5 cm−1.

Agreement for the completely deuterated isotopomer 28SiD4 is even better, with a mean

absolute deviation of 1.9 cm−1. For the 28SiH3D isotopomer, agreement is likewise excellent,

with a mean absolute deviation of 2.1 cm−1. It would appear that the force ﬁeld is certainly

of good enough quality to permit assignments for the less well known isotopomers.

For 28SiHD3, the only precisely known bands are the Si–H stretch, ν1=2187.2070(10)

cm−1 [15], and the ν5 degenerate bend, 850.680823(10) cm−1 [16]. Meal and Wilson [21],

in their 1956 low-resolution study, assigned absorptions at 1573, 1598, and 683 cm−1 to ν2,

ν4, and ν6, respectively. Our calculations conﬁrm this assignment and are on average within

about 2 cm−1 of all the above bands. ν3 was not observed by Meal and Wilson, and these

authors speculated that it coincide with the 683 cm−1 (ν6) peak. Our own calculations pre-

dict a splitting of about 5.7 cm−1 between ν3 and ν6; B3LYP/VTZ+1 [65] infrared intensity

calculations suggest that both bands should be observable. Inspection of the relevant spec-

trum (Fig. 3 in Ref. [21]) revealed that, at the resolution aﬀorded by the equipment used,

meaningful resolution between ν3 and ν6 becomes essentially impossible, especially given

contamination (noted by Meal and Wilson) from a SiH2D2 impurity with ν4=682.5 cm−1.

Until most recently, the only available information for SiH2D2 was the Meal and Wilson

work. Our calculations, like those of R¨otger et al. [22], unambiguously suggest assignment of

7

the 1601 and 1587 cm−1 bands to ν2 and ν6, respectively, rather than the opposite assignment

proposed by Meal and Wilson. We note that ν6 is in a very close Fermi resonance with ν5 +ν9

(the unperturbed levels being only about 10 cm−1 apart), despite the fairly small interaction

constant k569=-20.88 cm−1. Our calculations conﬁrm the assignments for all other bands

aside from ν1 and ν8, which are calculated to be within 1 cm−1 of each other such that a

meaningful decision on whether or not to exchange ν1 and ν8 is impossible. The Meal-Wilson

empirical force ﬁeld value of 844 cm−1 for ν5 (which they were unable to observe) agrees well

with our calculation as well as with the high-resolution value [22] of 842.38121(9) cm−1.

Of the very recent measurements by R¨otger et al. [22], all ﬁve bands in the Coriolis

pentad (ν3, ν4, ν5, ν7, and ν9) are in excellent agreement with the present calculation (mean

absolute deviation 1.1 cm−1).

Among the sources of residual error in the quartic force ﬁeld, neglect of inner-shell corre-

lation and imperfections to CCSD(T) appear to be the potentially largest. As seen in Table

1, inclusion of core correlation increases harmonic frequencies by as much as 7 cm−1 in this

case. The eﬀect of correlation beyond CCSD(T) was seen to work in the opposite direction

for the ﬁrst-row diatomic hydrides [64]; in the present work, we have compared FCI/VDZ+1

and CCSD(T)/VDZ+1 harmonic frequencies for the SiH diatomic in the X 2Π and a 4Σ−

states, and found a reduction in ωe of 4 and 10 cm−1, respectively. (The FCI–CCSD(T)

diﬀerence for ωe was found in Ref. [64] to converge very rapidly with the basis set.) Since

FCI frequency calculations in a reasonable-sized basis set for SiH4 are simply not a realistic

option, we have taken another track.

We have assumed that the computed CCSD(T)/VQZ+1 force ﬁeld is fundamentally

sound, and that any residual error would mostly aﬀect the equilibrium bond distance and the

diagonal quadratic force constants. We have then taken our quartic force ﬁeld in symmetry

coordinates, substituted the computed CCSD(T)/MTcore bond distance (which agrees to

four decimal places with the best experimental value), and have iteratively reﬁned the four

diagonal quadratic force constants such that the four experimental fundamentals of 28SiH4

are exactly reproduced by our calculation. The ﬁnal adjusted force ﬁeld is given in Table 3

8

and is available in machine-readable format from the corresponding author.

As seen in Table 2, our computed fundamentals for the other isotopomers with the ad-

justed force ﬁeld are in essentially perfect agreement with experiment where accurate values

are available. Discrepancies arise for some modes of SiH2D2, SiHD3, and SiD4 where only

low-resolution data are available. Particularly the discrepancy for ν2 of SiD4 is completely

out of character: the experimental diﬃculties involved in its determination [17] suggest that

perhaps the experimental value may be in error. (A discrepancy of 1.2 cm−1 for ν2 in SiH3D

is halved upon accounting for a Fermi resonance 2ν8 ≈ ν2.) We hope that our computed

force ﬁeld will stimulate further spectroscopic work on SiH4 and may serve as a basis for

studies employing more sophisticated vibrational treatments, such as the variational tech-

niques variational techniques very recently applied to methane [4] or high-order canonical

Van Vleck perturbation theory. As noted in the Introduction, a study of the latter type is

already in progress. [25]

B. Geometry

At the CCSD(T)/MTcore level, we compute a bond distance of 1.4734 ˚A, which we

know from experience [66,67] should be very close to the true value. Ohno, Matsuura,

Endo, and Hirota (OMEH1) [68] estimate an experimental re bond distance of 1.4741 ˚A

without supplying an error bar; in a subsequent study (OMEH2) [69], the same authors, using

two diﬀerent methods, obtain 1.4734(10) ˚A (“method I”) and 1.4707(6) ˚A (“method II”),

respectively, where uncertainties in parentheses are three standard deviations. The deviation

between the (diatomic approximation) “method II” value and our present calculation is more

than an order of magnitude greater than usual for this level of ab initio theory, while the

“method I” value agrees to four decimal places with our calculation. (Normally, because

of neglect of correlation eﬀects beyond CCSD(T) which have the tendency [64] to lengthen

bonds by 0.0002–0.0006 ˚A, we expect our computed bond distance to be slightly short, rather

than too long.) The computed bond distance of R¨otger et al., 1.4735 ˚A at the CCSD(T)[all

9

electron] level in a mixed basis set which does not contain any core correlation functions, is

likewise in excellent agreement with the OMEH2 “method I” value.

C. Atomization energy of SiH4

Using a 3-point geometric extrapolation A+B.C −n from the SCF/AVnZ+2d1f (n=T,Q,5)

atomization energies, we ﬁnd an SCF limit component of the total atomization energy of

259.83 kcal/mol, only marginally diﬀerent from the directly computed SCF/AV5Z+2d1f

value of 259.82 kcal/mol and only 0.05 kcal/mol larger than the GS result.

The CCSD valence correlation component was extrapolated using the 2-point formula

[70] A + B/n3 from AVnZ+2d1f (n=Q,5) results; thus we obtain a CCSD limit of 64.26

kcal/mol, which is 0.8 kcal/mol larger than the largest basis set value (63.45 kcal/mol)

and 1.4 kcal/mol larger than the largest basis set value of GS (62.86 kcal/mol). Using the

alternative 3-point extrapolation [71] A + B/(l + 1/2)C from AVnZ+2d1f (n=T,Q,5) we

obtain a somewhat smaller basis set limit of 63.92 kcal/mol; however, as discussed in Ref.

[43], this procedure appears to systematically underestimate basis set limits and was found

[72] to yield excellent agreement with experiment largely due to an error compensation with

neglect of scalar relativistic eﬀects.

At 0.81 kcal/mol, the extrapolated basis set limit contribution of connected triple exci-

tations is quite modest, and diﬀers by only 0.02 kcal/mol from the largest basis set value

of 0.79 kcal/mol. In fact, it is largely immaterial whether the extrapolation is done from

AVnZ+2d1f (n=T,Q) or from AVnZ+2d1f (n=Q,5), and we obtain essentially the same re-

sult for the (T) contribution as GS (0.82 kcal/mol). This is an illustration of the fact [73]

that connected triple excitations generally converge more rapidly with basis set than the

CCSD correlation energy.

Adding up the two basis set limit values, we ﬁnd a valence correlation component to TAE

of 65.05 kcal/mol; given the essentially purely single-reference character of the SiH4 wave

function there is little doubt that the CCSD(T) limit is very close to the full CI limit as well.

10

As noted by GS, the contribution of inner-shell correlation of SiH4 is negative: we ﬁnd

-0.365 kcal/mol compared to their -0.31 kcal/mol. The spin-orbit contribution is trivially ob-

tained from the Si(3P ) atomic ﬁne structure [74] as -0.43 kcal/mol, while our computed scalar

relativistic contribution, -0.70 kcal/mol, is essentially identical to the CG value. Finally, we

obtain TAEe=323.39 kcal/mol.

The anharmonic zero-point vibrational energy (ZPVE) from our best force ﬁeld (includ-

ing E0) is 19.59 kcal/mol. This is very close to the value of 19.69 kcal/mol obtained by GS

as an average of estimated fundamentals and CISD/TZ2P harmonic frequencies: the com-

putational eﬀort involved in improving this estimate by a mere 0.1 kcal/mol would therefore

have been hard to justify if the anharmonic force ﬁeld would not have been required for an-

other purpose. Also, from past experience [75], we know that such good agreement between

rigorous anharmonic ZPVEs and estimates cannot be taken for granted for hydrides.

Our best TAEe and ZPVE ﬁnally lead to TAE0=303.80 kcal/mol, to which we attach an

error bar of about 0.18 kcal/mol based on previous experience [43]. This should be compared

with the GS largest basis set result of 303.03 kcal/mol (or 302.36 kcal/mol after applying the

CG scalar relativistic contributions) or the value derived from JANAF heats of formation of

Si(g), H(g), and SiH4(g), 302.62 kcal/mol.

If we consider alternative values for ∆H ◦

f,0[Si(g)] of 108.1±0.5 kcal/mol (GS), 107.4±0.5

kcal/mol (applying CG to the latter value), or 107.15±0.38 kcal/mol (Martin & Taylor

[33]), we would obtain from our calculation ∆H ◦

f,0[SiH4(g)] values of 10.8±0.5, 10.1±0.5, and

9.9±0.4 kcal/mol, respectively. Only the ﬁrst of these values cannot be reconciled with Gunn

and Green; the very similar values derived from the Collins-Grev-Schaefer and Martin-Taylor

∆H ◦

f,0[Si(g)] agree to within accumulated error bars with both the JANAF and Gunn-Green

values for the heat of formation of silane. While our best value of 9.9±0.4 kcal/mol at

ﬁrst sight slightly favors the Gunn-Green value (in which the Si(cr)→Si(amorph) transition

enthalpy [36] was considered an artifact of the manner of preparation), the diﬀerence is “too

close to call”. We contend that our calculated value is more reliable than either experiment.

11

IV. CONCLUSIONS

From accurate ab initio calculations and a minor empirical adjustment, a quartic force

ﬁeld for silane has been derived that is consistently of spectroscopic quality (±1 cm−1 on

vibrational fundamentals) for all isotopomers of silane studied here (28SiH4, 29SiH4, 30SiH4,

28SiH3D, 28SiH2D2, 28SiHD3, and 28SiD4). As in previous studies on second-row molecules,

we found that inner-shell polarization functions have an appreciable eﬀect on computed

properties, and for hydrides this apparently includes the vibrational anharmonicities.

From large basis set coupled cluster calculations and extrapolations to the inﬁnite-basis

set limit, we obtain TAE0=303.80±0.18 kcal/mol, which includes an anharmonic zero-

point energy (19.59 kcal/mol),

inner-shell correlation (−0.36 kcal/mol), scalar relativis-

tic corrections (−0.70 kcal/mol), and atomic spin-orbit corrections (−0.43 kcal/mol).

In

combination with the recently revised ∆H ◦

f,0[Si(g)], 107.15±0.39 kcal/mol [33], we obtain

∆H ◦

f,0[SiH4(g)]=9.9±0.4 kcal/mol, intermediate between the JANAF and Gunn-Green val-

ues of 10.5±0.5 and 9.5±0.5 kcal/mol, respectively.

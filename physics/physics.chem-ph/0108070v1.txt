Abstract

Coupling and decoupling of chemical reactions are explored

through a modiﬁed heat balance equation. Reaction enthalpies

are found to play crucial role; the sign of their product for a pair

of consecutive chemical reactions determine whether they couple

or not. The possibility of a coupling-uncoupling transition for

such reactions is thus introduced for the ﬁrst time. The present

work resolves a paradox concerning negative eﬃciency of coupled

consecutive chemical reactions. Enthalpy is also shown to be a

”constant of motion” along the reaction coordinate as long as the

mass action ratio varies little with temperature. The present anal-

ysis puts the observed diﬀerence between calorimetric and van’t

Hoﬀ enthalpies on a quantitative basis. A case study is presented

with a third order reaction where the enthalpic criterion is useful

in selecting the more probable of the alternative mechanisms.

I. INTRODUCTION

The present work extends an earlier attempt [1] to generalize the conven-

tional phenomenology [2–4] for describing thermodynamics of chemical reac-

tions. The conventional approach, though based on the limiting assumption of

near equilibrium, was applied to complex processes [5] successfully. Coupling

of chemical reactions, however was treated [4] using a rather special example

of a cyclic reaction system. For non-cyclic e.g. consecutive reaction schemes,

the Onsager matrix is shown to be diagonal, ruling out phenomenological cou-

pling. Conventional chemical wisdom, on the other hand, assumes a set of

reactions to be coupled provided they have common intermediate(s). More

importantly, the eﬃciency of coupling can be shown to be always negative for

coupling schemes treated in the traditional way, whether in linear or n non-

linear domain. This renders the description of coupling itself as invalid in the

established format. We show, on the contrary, how minor modiﬁcations in the

balance equations lead to alteration in the deﬁnition of macroscopic ﬂuxes and

forces in chemical reaction systems [6,7] permitting coupling. The reactions

may now be coupled if enthalpy change in each is non-vanishing. Also, en-

thalpy remains a ”constant of motion” along reaction coordinate provided the

mass action ratio has a small variation with temperature. The recent debate

on diﬀerence between van’t Hoﬀ and calorimetric enthalpies [8] are put on a

more quantitative basis with our approach. A case study with a third order

reaction having two possible mechanisms shows that our approach correctly

identiﬁes the more probable pathway.

II. THE BALANCE EQUATION REVISITED

Let us brieﬂy recall the phenomenological equations for chemical coupling

widely used in chemical literature. [4,7] For a set of reactions ρ(= 1, ....r) in a

ﬁxed volume, the rates of change of entropy, concentration etc. are given by

∂sv/∂t = −∇.Js + σ

∂ci/∂t = −∇.Ji + X
ρ

νiρvρ

∂qv/∂t = −∇.Jq + X
ρ

vρ∆Hρ

T dsv = dqv − X
i

µidci

(1)

(2)

(3)

(4)

Here, sv, Js are the density and ﬂux terms for entropy, ci, Ji those for the ith

chemical species and qv, Jq those for heat. νiρ is the stoichiometric coeﬃcient

of the ith species in the ρth chemical reaction for which the velocity is vρ. σ

is the entropy production term. While ∆Hρ is the enthalpy change of the ρth

chemical reaction, the corresponding Gibbs free energy change, ∆Gρ, is given

by the law of mass action as

∆Gρ = −RT ln(v+

ρ /v

−
ρ )

(5)

where v+

ρ and v−

ρ are the forward and reverse reaction velocities of the ρth

recation, and vρ = v+

ρ − v−

ρ . From eqs. (1) - (4), equating non-gradient parts,

σ = Jq.∇(1/T ) − X

Ji.∇(µi/T ) + X
ρ

vρ(∆Hρ − X
i

µiνiρ)/T

For an isothermal chemical reaction system in a well-stirred (or homoge-

neous) medium we get,

σ = X
ρ

vρ∆Sρ

from ∆Gρ = ∆Hρ − T ∆Sρ and the second law. Note that the rate of entropy

production is obtained as a stoichiometric sum of entropy changes of reaction

steps, without invoking any assumption of linearity of processes.

Our eq. (7) can be compared with the standard one for σ found in chemical

literature, [4,7] viz.

Following standard phenomenological notations,

Linearising eq. (5), and using vρ = v+

(10)

where δρρ

′ is the Kronecker delta. Such a diagonal nature of L makes coupling

between two diﬀerent reactions impossible. Please note that coupling between

cyclic reactions can still emerge in this treatment, Onsager’s example [4] being

the most famous one.

This impossibility does not occur in our treatment since unlike eq. (8), eq.

III. PHENOMENOLOGICAL VS. CHEMICAL COUPLING

Coupling of chemical reactions, while gaining in popularity over the past

few decades, have received little attention from theoreticians. The major con-

tributors have been Prigogine and his coworkers [4,9]. Perhaps, the importance

of coupled reactions is felt nowhere more than in treatments of biochemical

cycles [10]. Glycolytic or the basic bioenergetic cycle (oxidative phosphoryla-

tion) are examples of intricate coupling of consecutive and cyclic reactions [5].

Yet, quantitative expression of reaction coupling is absent in existing literature

in these ﬁelds.

According to Prigogine [4], a pair of reactions with aﬃnities Ai and Aj and

velocities vi and vj can couple if signs of Aivj and Ajvj are diﬀerent. This

means that one reaction must drive another for the two reactions to couple.

Based on this idea, Rottenberg [5] deﬁned eﬃciency of coupling as

where the subscripts 1 and 2 denote the driven and the driving reactions re-

η = −A1v1/A2v2

5

spectively. However, Hill [11] pointed out that

A × v ≥ 0

for individual reactions. Thus eﬃciency of coupling is negative and coupling of

consecutive reactions at least is ruled out. This poses a far stronger challenge

to the conventional theory describing coupling, as an objection to the problem

posed by diagonal nature of the Onsager matrix, as shown in eq. (10), could

be that the treatment there is strictly linear. Although Hill’s derivation is

consistent with eq. (5), his conjecture that coupling of chemical reactions is

only possible via common intermediates and has no phenomenological meaning

otherwise, is hardly acceptable. In fact, Hill never sought to explain why a

consecutive reaction pair always has a negative eﬃciency. The lacuna was in

not appreciating a more fundamental problem, viz. the nature of the driving

force behind reaction coupling. This impasse has been resolved by the present

work, where the key steps in this regard were modiﬁcation of eq. (8) to (7),

and of eq. (9) to (11). From eq. (11) it is clear that in our theory the eﬃciency

of coupling need not be always negative. Also, the Onsager matrix Lρρ

′ is not

necessarily diagonal. It can thus be used as a proper measure of the coupling

strength between two reactions. The general approach is not only useful in

resolving the paradox stated earlier, it also provides a simple thermodynamic

criterion for coupling in simple reaction systems. For example, if the enthalpy

of any reaction step ρ is zero, that reaction can not couple with any other

reaction step ρ

as Lρρ

′ again becomes diagonal.

IV. GIBBS RELATION ALONG REACTION TRAJECTORY: ∆HCAL

VS ∆HV H

This is an interface between kinetics and thermodynamics of reaction pro-

cesses [4]. For a reaction system the free energy change of the ρth reaction

away from equilibrium can be expressed by

∆Gρ = ∆G0

ρ + RT lnKρ

(12)

where the mass action ratio Kρ is given by

Writing the entropy change along the ρth reaction as a stoichiometric sum of

molal entropies, Si

Kρ = Y
j

cνiρ
j

∆Sρ = X
i

νiρSi

(13)

(14)

From the relation ∆Sρ = −∂∆Gρ/∂T , eq. (12) and ∆Gρ = ∆Hρ − T ∆Sρ,

∆Sρ = ∆S0

ρ − RlnKρ − R(∂lnKρ/∂lnT )

(15)

A simple consequence of eq. (15) is,

7

∆Hρ = ∆H 0

ρ − RT (∂lnKρ/∂lnT )

(16)

Let us identify the two ∆H terms appearing in eq. (16) clearly. At equilib-

rium, eq. (16) becomes

∆H eq

ρ = ∆H 0

ρ − RT [∂lnKρ/∂lnT ]eq

(17)

If the second term on RHS becomes very small, we are left with

∆Hρ ≃ ∆H 0
ρ

(18)

Eq.

(18) may be stated as follows:

the enthalpy remains approximately a

constant of motion along the reaction co-ordinate for any reaction (the van’t

Hoﬀ approximation). Note that where it is not so, i.e. where ∆Hρ depends

on the reaction coordinate and may even change its sign from ∆H 0

ρ , a pair of

coupled reactions may become decoupled or vice versa, as the coupling depends

on sign of the product of the enthalpies of the respective reactions. A coupling-

uncoupling transition is therefore possible for such a set of chemical reactions.

Much further work is needed in this area.

∆H eq

ρ is clearly the experimentally measured enthalpy change in a reaction

viz. ∆Hcal, which is conventionally measured at equilibrium (or near equi-

librium) conditions. But the ﬁrst term on RHS of eq. (16) or (17) can be

identiﬁed with the van’t Hoﬀ enthalpy of the reaction viz. ∆HvH , deﬁned as

8

∆HvH = ∆H 0

ρ = RT (∂lnKeq/∂lnT )

(19)

Based on this discussion and the last two equations, we can write

∆Hcal = ∆HvH − RT [∂lnKρ/∂lnT ]eq

(20)

There is a large and growing body of evidence [8,12–19] (including some un-

published work [20]) of discrepancy between ∆Hcal and ∆HvH . There is also

an awareness of the importance of the ratio of these two values, especially in

interpreting biocalorimetric data [21]. While for simple chemical reactions the

ratio is close to unity, for reactions involving macromolecules e.g.

in protein

folding, there is clear departure of the ratio from unity.

In biochemical lit-

erature, [19,21] the numerical value of the ratio (which may vary from 0.5 to

more than 4 [13], say) is taken to provide a measure of cooperativity of the

biochemical reaction (e.g.

folding). Our analysis gives a clear insight into

the diﬀerence between the two enthalpy values. The origin of this diﬀerence

stems from the diﬀerence in temperature dependence of equilibrium and non-

equilibrium mass action ratios. Let us also recall that such diﬀerence between

equilibrium and non-equilibrium values are accepted naturally for Gibbs free

energy, for example, and the diﬀerence considered in terms of a mass action

ratio.

We realize that further simpliﬁcation of eq. (20) may be diﬃcult. Instead,

we use certain experimental data to show that the mass action ratio, Kρ, may

have a scaling dependence on the experimental temperature. Holtzer [12] es-

timates that the diﬀerence between the calorimetric and van’t Hoﬀ enthalpies

9

may be of the order of 45 calories per stoichiometric unit for simple chemical

reactions. From eq. (20), this leads to

∂lnKρ/∂lnT ≃ −45/(300 × 1.98) = −0.075

(21)

at room temperature (3000 K). We immediately obtain

Kρ ≃ const × T −α

(22)

where α ≃ 0.075 for simple chemical reactions.

V. COUPLING COEFFICIENTS IN TWO STEP REACTION -

KINETIC APPROXIMATION

Using the dissipation eq. (7), we may express the phenomenological rela-

tion of a pair of reactions by

∆S2 = R21v1 + R22v2

where v1 and v2 are velocities of the two reactions and Rij are the coupling

terms. The pre-equilibrium condition [22] is given by

∆G1 −→ 0

and

v1 −→ 0

(23)

If we use the approximate linear relation in such cases

10

∆S1 = R11v1 + R12v2 ≃ R12v2

(24)

∆G1 ≃ 0 implies ∆H1 ≃ T ∆S1. Using the arguments of eq. (24), the entropy

change in the ﬁrst reaction is given as

Using eq. (24), eq. (25) assumes the form

∆S1 ≃ ∆H 0

1 /T

∆H 0

1 = R

12v2

′

(25)

(26)

′

where R

12 = T R12. The approximate form of the dissipation equation can be

expressed as

σ = ∆S1v1 + ∆S2v2 ≃ ∆S2v2 ≥ 0

(27)

As v2, velocity of the rate-determining step, is positive both for positive and

negative coupling, the pre-equilibrium approximation should satisfy

∆S2 ≥ 0

(28)

Eqs.

(25) - (28) express the nature of thermodynamic coupling that may

11

exist for kinetic schemes satisfying the pre-equilibrium condition. Eq. (26)

implies that velocity of the rate determining step will be proportional to the

enthalpy change in the pre-equilibrium step. It may be interesting to note that

for positive coupling, the pre-equilibrium step must be endothermic and vice

versa. If on the other hand the coupling is negative the relation ∆H 0

1 ≤ 0 must

be satisﬁed. The negative coupling implies that one of the reactions among

the pair has a negative dissipative component and is therefore driven by the

other.

VI. A CASE STUDY WITH IN A SIMPLE REACTION

Let us consider a typical chemical reaction

Using reported molar enthalpy values [23] the overall ∆H0 of this reaction

is approximately 27.02 Kcal/mole. The standard mechanism (henceforth re-

ferred to as mechanism I) cited [24] is the following one:

2NO + O2 → 2NO2

2NO = N2O2

N2O2 + O2 → 2NO2

12

This mechanism is able to explain the accepted rate law for the overall reaction

viz.

as also the negative sign of the activation energy of the overall reaction. [25]

Recently, [26] an alternative mechanism (referred to as mechanism II), has

been proposed, namely

Rate = k[NO]2[O2]

NO + O2 = OONO

OONO + NO → 2NO2

which agrees with the rate law given above. According to Plambeck, [26] spec-

troscopic evidence admits of simultaneous existence of both these mechanisms

in the overall reaction, although concentration of OONO may be larger than

N2O2. Both the intermediates are short lived species, and although there is

speculation about the structure of N2O2, [27] nothing is known about OONO.

We performed ab-initio calculations on N2O2 and OONO. The GAMESS

software package [28] was used with the ccpVTZ basis set, [29] augmented by a

d and diﬀuse s, p type polarization functions. We present only thermochemical

data in Kcal/mol (for ∆H 0 or ∆G0) or cal/mol-K (for ∆S0). Subscripts 1 and

2 represent the two steps in the overall reaction. Along with standard data

[23–27] our results are (with an estimated error limit of ±10 percent)

For mechanism I:

∆S0

1 = -40.68 cal/mol-K

∆S0

2 = 5.93 cal/mol-K

∆H 0

1 = -30.2 Kcal/mol

∆H 0

2 = 3.18 Kcal/mol

∆G0

1 = -17.9 Kcal/mol

∆G0

2 = 1.4 Kcal/mol

13

Corresponding values for Mechanism II are

∆S0

1 = -34.34 cal/mol-K

∆S0

2 = -0.39 cal/mol-k

∆H 0

1 = -11.60 Kcal/mol

∆H 0

2 = -15 Kcal/mol

∆G0

1 = -1.29 Kcal/mol

∆G0

2 = -15.29 Kcal/mol

It is clear that in both the mechanisms the enthalpy change in the pre-

equilibrium step has a negative sign. Eq.

(26) implies that one reaction

must drive the other. From eq. (28) it follows that for both the mechanisms,

∆S2 = ∆S0

2 − RlnK2 > 0, where K2 is the mass action ratio for the second

step of the reaction. Therefore,

for Mechanism I

∆S0

2 ≥ Rln[NO2]2/([N2O2][O2])

(29)

and for Mechanism II

∆S0

2 ≥ Rln[NO2]2/([NO]2[OONO])

(30)

If the intermediate concentration is small, ∆S0

2 must be greater than a pos-

itive quantity. This need not be the case if the intermediate has a higher

concentration, since then the right hand side of inequality (30) shifts towards

more negative value. Incidentally, the ﬁrst mechanism has a positive ∆S0

2 . In

the second mechanism ∆S0

2 has a value approaching zero. In this case, (30)

14

can hold good provided the intermediate concentration has a higher value. As

pointed out by Plambeck, [26] both the mechanisms are known to exist, but

higher concentration is seen for OONO. The observation is thus in accordance

with the thermodynamic arguments presented above.

VII. CONCLUDING REMARKS

The present paper shows that coupling of chemical reactions should not

be described in vague qualitative terms e.g. existence of common chemical

intermediates. A pair of reactions remain decoupled as long as the product of

their reaction enthalpies is non-negative. Coupling can only occur if they have

enthalpies of opposite signs. An interesting corollary is that the same pair of

reactions can undergo a transition from coupled to decoupled state (or vice

versa), provided the mass action ratio of one or both the reactions change ap-

preciably with progress of the reaction(s). An important modiﬁcation brought

forward by the present work is that the rate of internal entropy change near

equilibrium is a weighted sum of the entropies (and not free energies or chem-

ical aﬃnities, as the form in which it is usually expressed) of the participating

reactions. The observed deviation of calorimetric (measured) enthalpy from

the van’t Hoﬀ value for a reaction has also been explained, the origin of which

is shown to be in the diﬀerence in the temperature dependence of equilibrium

and non-equilibrium mass action ratios. For a class of simple chemical reac-

tions, where the deviation is small, the enthalpy remains a constant of motion

along the reaction coordinate. Finally, our treatment is shown to identify the

more probable of alternate pathways for a typical third order chemical reac-

tion.

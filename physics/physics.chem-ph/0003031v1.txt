Abstract

The isotope eﬀect in the scattering of methane is studied by wavepacket simu-
lations of oriented CH4 and CD4 molecules from a ﬂat surface including all nine
internal vibrations. At a translational energy up to 96 kJ/mol we ﬁnd that the
scattering is still predominantly elastic, but less so for CD4. Energy distribution
analysis of the kinetic energy per mode and the potential energy surface terms,
when the molecule hits the surface, are used in combination with vibrational exci-
tations and the corresponding deformation. They indicate that the orientation with
three bonds pointing towards the surface is mostly responsible for the isotope eﬀect
in the methane dissociation.

1 Introduction

The dissociation of methane on transition metals is an important reaction in
catalysis. It is the rate limiting step in steam reforming to produce syngas.[1]
It is also prototypical for C–H activation in other processes. A large number of
molecular beam experiments in which the dissociation energy was measured as
a function of translational energy have already been done on this system.[2–
22] These experiments have contributed much to our understanding of the
mechanism of the dissociation. Some of them observed that vibrationally hot
CH4 dissociates more readily than cold CH4, with the energy in the inter-
nal vibrations being about as eﬀective as the translational energy in inducing
dissociation.[2–8] A more detailed assessment of the importance of the inter-
nal vibrations could not be made, because of the large number of internal

vibrations. A recent molecular beam experiment with laser excitation of the
ν3 mode succeeded in measuring a dramatical enhancement of the dissociation
on a Ni(100) surface, but it is still much too low to account for the vibrational
activation observed in previous studies and indicates that other vibrationally
excited modes contribute signiﬁcantly to the reactivity of thermal samples.[22]

Wavepacket simulations are being used more and more to study the dynamics
of this kind of molecule surface reactions. The published wavepacket simula-
tions on the methane dissociation reaction on transition metals have treated
the methane molecule always as a diatomic up to now.[23–27] Besides the C–H
bond and molecule surface distance, a combination of other coordinates were
included, like (multiple) rotations and some lattice motion. None of them
have looked at the role of the internal vibrations. Various theoretical stud-
ies have obtained reaction pathways and barriers for dissociation by DFT
calculations,[28–37] but they cannot explain the role of the vibrational modes
in the reaction dynamics either.

A nice way to study reaction dynamics is the use of isotopes. The most re-
cent wavepacket simulation on the dissociation probability of CH4 and CD4
showed a semiquantitative agreement with the molecular beam experiments of
Ref.[5], except for the isotope eﬀect and the extracted vibrational eﬃcacy.[27]
The molecular beam study with laser excitation of the ν3 asymmetrical stretch
mode shows that the incorrect vibrational eﬃcacy is caused by the assump-
tions in the ﬁt procedure that both stretch modes behaves identical.[22] One of
the possible explanation of the incorrect isotope eﬀect can be the role played
by the non-included intramolecular vibrations.

In a previous paper we reported on wavepacket simulations that we have done
to determine which and to what extent internal vibrations are important for
the dissociation of CH4.[38] We were not able yet to simulate the dissocia-
tion including all internal vibrations. Instead we simulated the scattering of
methane, for which all internal vibrations can be included, and used the results
to deduce consequences for the dissociation. We used model potential energy
surfaces (PESs) that have been developed with Ni(111) in mind, but our re-
sults should hold for other surfaces as well. At a translational energy up to 96
kJ/mol we found that the scattering is almost completely elastic. Vibrational
excitations when the molecule hits the surface and the corresponding deforma-
tion depend on generic features of the potential energy surface. In particular,
our simulations indicate that for methane to dissociate the interaction of the
molecule with the surface should lead to an elongated equilibrium C–H bond
length close to the surface.

We have been using the multiconﬁgurational time-dependent Hartree (MCTDH)
method for our wavepacket simulation, because it can deal with a large num-
ber of degrees of freedom and with large grids.[39,40] This method has been

2

applied successfully to gas phase reactions and reactions at surfaces.[41–60]

In this paper we report wavepacket simulations of CD4 scattering including
all internal vibrations for ﬁxed orientations, performed on the same model
PESs as in our previous paper.[38] Translational motion parallel to the sur-
face and all rotational motion was neglected. No degrees of freedom of the
surface were included. Experiments show that coupling with these degrees of
freedom is dependent on the metal surface. For example, the observed surface
temperature eﬀect are small on Ni[5], but quite large on Pt[7]. As we are only
interested in the role of internal vibrations, we have not included degrees of
freedom of the surface to keep the simulations as simple as possible. We will
discuss the vibrational excitation and the deformation of the CD4 molecule
when it hits the surface and compare it with CH4. Later on we will look at the
energy distribution of the kinetic energy per mode and the potential energy
in some terms of the PES with the elongated equilibrium bond length close
to the surface for both isotopes. The transfer of translational kinetic energy
towards vibrational kinetic energy gives an indication about the dissociation
probability, since vibrational kinetic energy helps in overcoming the dissoci-
ation barrier. It gives a better idea too about which modes are essential to
include in a more accurate wavepacket simulation of methane dissociation.
After that we will discuss the implications of this for the dissociation and give
a summary with some general conclusions.

2 Computational details

2.1 The Potential Energy Surfaces

We used for the scattering of CD4 the same model PESs as we did for CH4.
Since we expressed the PES in mass-weighted coordinated the parameters in
the PESs for CD4 diﬀers from CH4. We will now give an overview of our
model PESs and the corresponding parameters for CD4. The parameters of
CH4 for these PESs were already given in Ref. [38], where also more detailed
information about our assumptions and contour plots of some cross-section of
the model PESs can be found.

The PESs we used can all be written as

Vtotal = Vintra + Vsurf ,

(1)

where Vintra is the intramolecular PES and Vsurf is the repulsive interaction
with the surface. For the Vintra we looked at four diﬀerent types of PESs. The

3

Vintra include also for two types changes in the intramolecular potential due to
interactions with the surface.

2.1.1 A harmonic potential

The ﬁrst one is completely harmonic. We have used normal mode coordinates
for the internal vibrations, because these are coupled only very weakly. In the
harmonic approximation this coupling is even absent so that we can write
Vintra as

Vintra = Vharm =

1
2

10

Xi=2

kiX 2
i ,

(2)

the summation is over the internal vibrations, Xi’s are mass-weighted displace-
ment coordinates and ki are mass-weighted force constants. (see Table 1 for
deﬁnitions and values); (X1 is the mass-weighted overall translation along the
surface normal).[61] The force constants have been obtained by ﬁtting them
on the experimental vibrational frequencies of CH4 and CD4.[62,63]

We have assumed that the repulsive interaction with the surface is only through
the deuterium atoms that point towards the surface. We take the z-axis as the
surface normal. In this case the surface PES is given by

Vsurf =

A
ND

ND

Xi=1

e−αzi,

(3)

where ND is the number of deuteriums that points towards the surface, α=1.0726
atomic units and A=6.4127 Hartree. These parameters are chosen to give the
same repulsion as the PES that has been used in an MCTDH wavepacket
simulation of CH4 dissociation.[26]

If we write Vsurf in terms of normal mode coordinates, then we obtain for one
deuterium pointing towards the surface

Vsurf = Ae−α1X1e−α2X2e−α3X3e−α4X4,

(4)

where A as above, and α’s as given in Table 2. X2, X3 and X4 correspond all
to a1 modes of the C3v symmetry (see Fig. 1). There is no coupling between
the modes X5 to X10 in the Vsurf part of the PES, which are all e modes of
the C3v symmetry.

For two deuteriums we obtain

b2 modes of C2v. X6 corresponds to the a2 mode of C2v and has no coupling
with the other modes in Vsurf.

corresponds to a1 modes in the C3v symmetry (see Fig. 1). Because these last
six coordinates correspond to degenerate e modes of the C3v symmetry, the β
parameters are not unique.

2.1.2 An anharmonic intramolecular potential

Even though we do not try to describe the dissociation of methane in this
and our previous paper, we do want to determine which internal vibration
might be important for this dissociation. The PES should at least allow the
molecule to partially distort as when dissociating. The harmonic PES does
not do this. A number of changes have therefor been made. The ﬁrst is that
we have describe the C–D bond by a Morse PES.

VMorse = De

Xi=1h1 − e−γ∆rii2

,

(7)

where De = 0.1828 Hartree (the dissociation energy of methane in the gas-
phase) and ∆ri the change in bond length from the equilibrium distance.
γ was calculated by equating the second derivatives along one bond of the
harmonic and the Morse PES. If we transform Eq. (7) back into normal mode
coordinates, we obtain

VMorse = De

Xi=1h1 − eγi2X2eγi3X3eγi4X4eγi7X7eγi8X8eγi9X9eγi,10X10i2

,

with De as above. γ’s are given in Tables 3 and 4. Note that, although we have
only changed the PES of the bond lengths, the ν4 umbrella modes are also
aﬀected. This is because these modes are not only bending, but also contain
some changes of bond length.

The new intramolecular PES now becomes

Vintra = Vharm + VMorse − Vcorr,

(9)

where Vharm is as given in Eq. (2) and Vcorr is the quadratic part of VMorse,
which is already in Vharm.

2.1.3 Intramolecular potential with weakening C–D bonds

When the methane molecule approach the surface the overlap of substrate
orbitals and anti-bonding orbitals of the molecule weakens the C–D bonds.
We want to include this eﬀect for the C–D bonds of the deuteriums pointing
towards the surface. We have redeﬁned the VMorse given in Eq. (8) and also
replace it in Eq. (9). A sigmoidal function is used to switch from the gas
phase C–D bond to a bond close to the surface. We have used the following,
somewhat arbitrary, approximations. (i) The point of inﬂection should be at
a reasonable distance from the surface. It is set to the turnaround point for
a rigid methane molecule with translation energy 93.2 kJ/mol plus twice the
fall-oﬀ distance of the interaction with the surface. (ii) The depth of the PES
of the C–D bond is 480 kJ/mol in the gas phase, but only 93.2 kJ/mol near
the surface. The value 93.2 kJ/mol corresponds to the height of the activation
barrier used in our dissociation.[26] (iii) The exponential factor is the same as
for the interaction with the surface.

If we transform to normal-mode coordinates for the particular orientations,
we then obtain

Vweak = De

Xi=1

Wih1 − eγi2X2eγi3X3eγi4X4eγi7X7eγi8X8eγi9X9eγi,10X10i2

where Wi = 1 for non-interacting bonds and

Wi =

1 + Ωe−α1X1+ω
1 + e−α1X1+ω

(11)

for the interacting bonds pointing towards the surface. α1 is as given in Table
2, γ’s are given in Tables 3 and 4, Ω = 1.942 · 10−1 and ω = 7.197.

2.1.4 Intramolecular potential with elongation of the C–D bonds

A weakened bond generally has not only a reduced bond strength, but also an
increased bond length. We include the eﬀect of the elongation of the C–D bond
length of the deuteriums that point towards the surface due to interactions
with the surface. We have redeﬁned the VMorse given in Eq. (8) and also replace
it in Eq. (9) for this type of PES. We have used the following approximations:
(i) The transition state, as determined by Ref. [30] and [64], has a C–H bond
that is 0.54 ˚A longer than normal. This elongation should occur at the turn
around point for a rigid methane molecule with a translation energy of 93.2
kJ/mol. (ii) The exponential factor is again the same as for the interaction
with the surface.

If we transform to normal-mode coordinates for the particular orientations,
then we obtain

Vshift = De

4

Xi=1h1 − eγi2X2eγi3X3eγi4X4eγi7X7eγi8X8eγi9X9eγi,10X10 exp[Sie−α1X1]i2

,(12)

where α1 is as given in Table 2, γ’s are given in Tables 3 and 4. For orientation
with one deuterium towards the surface we obtain; S1 = 2.942 · 102 and S2 =
S3 = S4 = 0, with two deuteriums; S1 = S2 = 0 and S3 = S4 = 1.698 · 102,
and with three deuteriums; S1 = 0 and S2 = S3 = S4 = 2.942 · 102.

2.2 Initial States

The exact wave-function of a D-dimensional system, is expressed in the MCTDH
approximation by the form

ΨMCTDH(q1, . . . , qD; t) = Xn1...nD

cn1...nD (t) ψ(1)

n1 (q1; t) . . . ψ(D)

nD (qD; t).

(13)

All initial states in the simulations start with the vibrational ground state.
The initial translational part ψ(tr) is represented by a Gaussian wave-packet,

ψ(tr)(X1) = (2πσ2)−1/4 exp"−

(X1 − X0)2

4σ2

+ iP1X1# ,

(14)

where σ is the width of the wave-packet (we used σ = 320.248 atomic units),
X0 is the initial position (we used X0 = 11σ, which is far enough from the
surface to observe no repulsion) and P1 is the initial momentum. Since we
used mass-weighted coordinates the Gaussian wavepacket are identical for CD4
and CH4. We performed simulations in the energy range of 32 to 96 kJ/mol.

7

We here present only the results of 96 kJ/mol (equivalent to P1 = −0.2704
atomic units), because they showed the most obvious excitation probabilities
for VMorse. We used seven natural single-particle states, 512 grid points and a
grid-length of 15σ for the translational coordinate. With this grid-width we
can perform simulation with a translational energy up to 144 kJ/mol.

Gauss-Hermite discrete-variable representations (DVR)[65] were used to rep-
resent the wavepackets of the vibrational modes. We used for all simulations of
CD4 the same number of DVR points as for CH4, which was 5 DVR points for
the ν2 bending modes and 8 DVR points for the ν4 umbrella, ν3 asymmetrical
stretch, and ν1 symmetrical stretch mode for an numerical exact integration,
except for the simulations with Vshift, where we used 16 DVR points for the ν1
symmetrical stretch mode, because of the change in the equilibrium position.

Also the same conﬁgurational basis was used for both isotopes. We did the
simulation with one bond pointing towards the surface in eight dimensions,
because the ν2 bending modes X5 and X6 do not couple with the other modes.
We needed four natural single-particle states for modes X2, X3 and X4, and
just one for the others. So the number of conﬁgurations was 71 · 43 · 14 = 448.
The simulation with two bonds pointing towards the surface was performed in
nine dimensions. One of the ν2 bending mode (X6) does not couple with the
other modes, but for the other mode X5 we needed four natural single-particle
states. The number of conﬁgurations was 71 · 44 · 14 = 1792, because we needed
the same number of natural single-particle states as mentioned above for the
other modes. We needed ten dimensions to perform the simulation with three
bonds pointing towards the surface. We used here one natural single-particle
state for the modes X5 to X10 and four natural single-particle states for X2
to X4, which gave us 71 · 43 · 16 = 448 conﬁgurations.

3 Results and Discussion

3.1 Excitation probabilities and structure deformation of CD4

The scattering probabilities for CD4 are predominantly elastic, as we also
found in our previous simulations of CH4 scattering.[38] The elastic scattering
probability is larger than 0.99 for all orientation of the PESs with VMorse and
Vweak at a translational energy of 96 kJ/mol. For the PES with Vshift we observe
an elastic scattering probability of 0.981 for the orientation with one, 0.955
with two and 0.892 with three deuteriums pointing towards the surface. This is
lower than we have found for CH4, which is 0.956 for the orientation with three
hydrogens pointing towards the surface and larger than 0.99 for the others.
The higher inelastic scattering probabilities of CD4 was expected, because the

8

force constants ki of CD4 are decreased up to 50% with respect to those of
CH4 and the translational surface repulsion fall-oﬀ diﬀers only little.

When we look at the excitation probabilities at the surface for the PES with
VMorse and Vweak, then we observe generally an increase for CD4 compared with
CH4, except for the ν4 umbrella mode in the orientation with two bond point-
ing towards the surface. Relevant diﬀerences in the structure deformations are
observed only in the bond angles, which are increased for CD4 in the orienta-
tions with one and three bonds pointing towards the surface. The bond angle
deformation of the angle between the bonds pointing towards the surface in
the orientation with two bonds pointing towards the surface is decreased for
CD4. We observe again that the PES with Vweak gives larger structure defor-
mations than the PES with VMorse, but the diﬀerences are smaller for CD4
than CH4.

For the PES with Vshift we do not observe this eﬀect on the bond angle defor-
mation. The bond angle deformation for the orientation with two and three
deuteriums pointing towards the surface is the same as for CH4 and it is just
0.1◦ less for the bond angle at the surface side in the orientation with one deu-
terium pointing towards the surface. The excitation probabilities (see Table 5)
for the ν2 bending and ν4 umbrella modes become higher for all orientations
for CD4, which is necessary for getting the same bond angle deformations as
CH4.

The changes in the bond distances for the orientations with one and two
bonds pointing towards the surface is for CD4 almost the same as for CH4.
For the orientation with three bonds pointing towards the surface, we found
that the maximum bond lengthening of the bonds on the surface side was
0.032 ˚A less for CD4 than CH4. We also found that the bond shortening of the
bond pointing away from the surface is 0.010 ˚A more for CD4. These are only
minimal diﬀerences, which also only suggest that the bond deformation for
CD4 has been inﬂuenced slightly more by the ν3 asymmetrical stretch mode
than the ν1 symmetrical stretch mode. The observed excitation probabilities
for these modes do not contradict this, but are not reliable enough for hard
conclusions because of their high magnitude. It is also not clear, beside of this
problem, what they really represent. Is the excitation caused by a diﬀerent
equilibrium position of the PES at the surface in a mode or is it caused by
extra energy in this mode? To answer these questions we decided to do an
energy distribution analysis during the scattering for both isotopes.

9

3.2 Energy distribution in CH4 and CD4

The energy distribution analysis is performed by calculating the expectation
values of the important term of the Hamiltonian H for the wave-function Ψ(t)
at a certain time t during the scattering of CD4 and CH4 for all presented
orientations in this and our previous paper.[38] We will present here only the
results of the PES with Vshift, because it is the only model PES for which the
energy distribution analysis is relevant for the discussion of the dissociation
hypotheses later on.

We can obtain good information about the energy distribution per mode by
looking at the kinetic energy expectation values hΨ(t)|Tj|Ψ(t)i per mode j
(see Table 6), because the kinetic energy operators Tj have no cross terms like
the PESs have. When we discuss the kinetic energy of a mode we normally
refer to the a1 mode of the C3v or C2v symmetry, because in these modes we
have observed the highest excitation probabilities and the change in kinetic
energy in the other modes is generally small.

By looking at the expectation values of some terms of the PES hΨ(t)|Vterm|Ψ(t)i
(see Table 7), we obtain information about how the kinetics of the scattering
is driven by the PES. The Vsurf PES [see Eqs. (4), (5) and (6)] is the surface
hydrogen/deuterium repulsion for a given orientation. Vharm(ν2) and Vharm(ν4)
[see Eq. (2)] are the pure harmonic terms of the intramolecular PES of the
a1 modes in the C3v and C2v symmetry corresponding to a ν2 bending and ν4
umbrella modes, respectively. The pure harmonic correction terms of Vcorr [see
Eq. (9)] are included in them. Vbond(Rup) and Vbond(Rdown) are the potential
energy in a single C–H or C–D bond pointing respectively towards and away
from the surface, and they give the expectation value of one bond term of Vshift
[see Eq. (12)]. All given expectation values are the maximum deviation of the
initial values, which eﬀectively means the values at the moment the molecule
hits the surface.

The largest changes in expectation values are, of course, in the kinetic energy
of the translational mode. The translational kinetic energy does not become
zero as we should expect in classical dynamics. The loss of translational kinetic
energy is primary absorbed by the Vsurf terms of the PESs. The expectation
values of the Vsurf terms show the ability of the hydrogens or deuteriums to
come close to the metal surface, since in real space their exponential fall-oﬀs
are the same for both isotopes. For a rigid molecule the sum of the translational
kinetic energy and Vsurf should be constant, so all deviations of this sum have
to be found back in the intramolecular kinetic energy and other PES terms.

We observe that both the minimum in the translational kinetic energy and
the maximum in the Vsurf terms were higher for CH4 than CD4, so we have to

10

ﬁnd more increase in energy in the intramolecular modes and PES terms for
CD4 than CH4. We indeed do so and that can be one of the reasons we found
higher inelastic scatter probabilities for CD4 for the PES with Vshift .

For the orientations with one and two bonds pointing towards the surface we
observe a large increase of the kinetic energy in the ν3 asymmetrical stretch
mode. If we compare this with the excitation probabilities, we ﬁnd that the
kinetic energy analysis gives indeed a diﬀerent view on the dynamics. For the
orientation with two bond pointing towards the surface we have found for both
isotopes very high excitation probabilities in the ν1 and ν3 stretch modes. We
know now from the kinetic energy distribution that for the ν1 symmetrical
stretch mode the high excitation probability is caused by the change of the
equilibrium position of the ν1 mode in the PES and that for the ν3 stretch
mode probably the PES also has become narrower.

For the orientation with three bonds pointing towards the surface we also
obtain an large increase of the kinetic energy of the ν3 asymmetrical stretch
mode, but we also ﬁnd an even larger increase in the kinetic energy of the
ν1 symmetrical stretch mode. The total kinetic energy was extremely large,
because the kinetic energy of the translational mode becomes also much larger
than for the other orientations. Because of this the Vsurf terms had to be around
twice as low as for the other orientations.

All Vbond(Rup) terms become lower compared to the initial value, especially in
the orientation with two bond pointing towards the surface. In the orientation
with one bond pointing towards the surface, the Vbond(Rdown) term became
higher. This is caused by the repulsion of Vsurf in the direction of the bond.
The increase of this PES term value is higher for CD4 than CH4.

In the orientation with three bond pointing towards the surface we also observe
a higher Vbond(Rdown) value, with also the highest increase for CD4. In relation
with the somewhat shorter bond distance for the Rdown of CD4 compared with
CH4, which was also a bit lower compared with the other orientations, we
know now that the hydrogens and especially the deuterium have problems in
following the minimum energy path of the PES with Vshift during the scattering
dynamics. This leads to higher kinetic energy in the vibrational modes, which
results in more inelastic scattering.

The Vharm(ν2) term increases in respect to the initial value, but not as much
as the increase of the Vharm(ν4) is for the orientation with two bonds pointing
towards the surface. The values of Vharm(ν4) for CD4 are even higher than for
CH4. We observe also a larger increase of the kinetic energy in the ν4 umbrella
mode for CD4 than for CH4. So although there is somewhat more energy
transfer to the vibrational modes for CD4 than CH4, this extra vibrational
energy is absorbed especially in the ν4 umbrella mode of CD4.

11

3.3 Dissociation hypotheses

We like now to discuss some possible implications of the scattering simulation
for the isotope eﬀect on the dissociation of methane. In our previous paper we
have already drawn some conclusions about the possible reaction mechanism
and which potential type would be necessary for dissociation.[38] We found the
direct breaking of a single C–H bond in the initial collision more reasonable
than the splats model with single bond breaking after an intermediary Ni–C
bond formation as suggested by Ref. [4], because the bond angle deformations
seems to small to allow a Ni–C to form. From the simulations with CD4
we can draw the same conclusions. The PES with Vshift gives the same angle
deformations for both isotopes, which is not suﬃcient for the splats model. The
other potentials give higher bond angle deformations for the orientation with
three deuteriums pointing towards the surface. If the Ni–C bond formation
would go along this reaction path, then the dissociation of CD4 should be even
more preferable than CH4, which is not the case. So we only have to discuss
the implication of the scattering simulation for the dissociation probabilities
of CH4 and CD4 for a direct breaking of a single bond reaction mechanism.
This reaction mechanism can be inﬂuenced by what we will call a direct or an
indirect eﬀect.

A direct eﬀects is the expected changes in the dissociation probability between
CH4 and CD4 for a given orientation. Since we expect that we need for disso-
ciation a PES with an elongation of the bonds pointing towards the surface,
we only have to look at the isotope eﬀect in the simulation for the PES with
Vshift for diﬀerent orientations to discuss some direct eﬀect. It is clear from our
simulations that the bond lengthening of CD4 is smaller than CH4 for the ori-
entation with three bonds pointing towards the surface. If this orientation has
a high contribution to the dissociation of methane, then this can be the rea-
son of the higher dissociation probability of CH4. In this case our simulations
also explain why Ref.[27] did not observe a high enough isotope eﬀect in the
dissociation probability of their simulation with CH4 and CD4 modelled by a
diatomic, because we do not observe a change in bond lengthening between
the isotopes for the orientation with one bond pointing towards the surface.

The orientation with three bonds pointing towards the surface is also the
orientation with the highest increase of the total vibrational kinetic energy
for the PES with Vshift, because the energy distribution analysis shows besides
an high increase of the kinetic energy in the ν3 asymmetrical stretch mode
also an high increase in the ν1 symmetrical stretch mode. Since vibrational
kinetic energy can be used eﬀectively to overcome the dissociation barrier, the
orientation with three bonds indicates to be a more preferable orientation for
dissociation. Moreover the relative diﬀerence in kinetic energy between both
isotopes is for the ν1 stretch mode larger than for the ν3 stretch mode. If the

12

kinetic energy in the ν1 stretch mode contributes signiﬁcantly to overcoming
the dissociation barrier, then it is another explanation for the low isotope
eﬀect in Ref.[27].

An indirect eﬀect is the expected changes in the dissociation probability be-
tween CH4 and CD4 through changes in the orientations distribution caused
by the isotope eﬀect in the vibrational modes. This can be the case if the
favourable orientation for dissociation is not near the orientation with three
bonds pointing towards the surface, but more in a region where one or two
bonds pointing towards the surface. These orientations do not show a large
diﬀerence in deformation for the PES with Vshift. We can not draw immediate
conclusion about the indirect eﬀect from our simulations, since we did not
include rotational motion, but our simulation show that an indirect isotope
eﬀect can exist. For the PES with VMorse in the orientation with three bonds
pointing towards the surface, we observe that CD4 is able to come closer to the
surface than CH4. So this rotational orientation should be more preferable for
CD4 than for CH4. On the other hand, if the PES is in this orientation more
like Vshift the dissociation probability in other orientation can be decreased for
CD4 through higher probability in inelastic scattering channels.

So for both eﬀects the behaviour of the orientation with three bonds point-
ing towards the surface seems to be essential for a reasonable description of
the dissociation mechanism of methane. A wavepacket simulation of methane
scattering including one or more rotational degrees of freedom and the vibra-
tional stretch modes will be a good starting model to study the direct and
indirect eﬀects, since most of the kinetic energy changes are observed in the
stretch modes and so the bending and umbrella modes are only relevant with
accurate PESs. Eventually dissociation paths can be introduced in the PES
along one or more bonds.

Beside of our descriptions of the possible isotopes eﬀect for the dissociation
extracted of the scatter simulations we have to keep in mind that also a tunnel-
ing mechanism can be highly responsible for the higher observed isotope eﬀect
in the experiment and that a diﬀerent dissociation barrier in the simulations
can enhance this eﬀect of tunneling.

4 Conclusions

The scattering is in all cases predominantly elastic. However, the observed in-
elastic scattering is higher for CD4 compared with previous simulation on CH4
for the PES with an elongated equilibrium bond length close to the surface.
When the molecule hits the surface, we observe in general a higher vibra-
tional excitation for CD4 than CH4. The PES with an elongated equilibrium

13

bond length close to the surface gives for both isotopes almost the same defor-
mations, although we observe a somewhat smaller bond lengthening for CD4
in the orientation with three bonds pointing towards the surface. The other
model PESs show diﬀerences in the bond angle deformations and in the distri-
bution of the excitation probabilities of CD4 and CH4, especially for the PES
with only an anharmonic intramolecular potential.

Energy distribution analysis contributes new information on the scattering
dynamics. A higher transfer of translational energy towards vibrational kinetic
energy at the surface results in higher inelastic scattering. The highest increase
of vibrational kinetic energy is found in the ν3 asymmetrical stretch modes for
all orientations and also in the ν1 symmetrical stretch mode for the orientation
with three bonds pointing towards the surface, when the PES has an elongated
equilibrium bond length close to the surface.

Our simulations give an indication that the isotope eﬀect in the methane
dissociation is caused mostly by the diﬀerence in the scattering behaviour of
the molecule in the orientation with three bonds pointing towards the surface.
At least multiple vibrational stretch modes should be included for a reasonable
description of isotope eﬀect in the methane dissociation reaction.

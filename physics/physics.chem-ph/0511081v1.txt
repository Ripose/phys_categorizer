N PzzT and µPzzT simulations of K-montmorillonite hydrates were performed employing hybrid
Monte Carlo simulations. Two condition sets were studied, P=1 atm and T= 300 K (ground level
conditions), and P=600 atm and T= 394 K; this last condition mimics a burial depth close to 4
km. For these conditions, swelling curves as a function of the reservoir water vapor pressure were
built. We found the single layer K-montmorillonite hydrate stable for high vapor pressures for both,
burial and ground level conditions. A simple explanation for this high stability is given.

INTRODUCTION

Clays are layer type aluminosilicate minerals, existent
everywhere in nature and industry, hence the importance
of a detailed understanding of their physics and chem-
istry. They are used as building materials, ceramics, and
catalysts; they are employed in cosmetics, as rheological
modiﬁers for paints, and in technological processes such
us oil well drilling. In this last application, the control of
their stability is a key for drilling success. During it, the
use of water based muds induce destabilization of shale
and clay formations that would disintegrate, or heave,
upon contact with water.

One way to maintain stability of shales during the
drilling process is by addition of potassium salts to
drilling muds. This helps to avoid ﬂuid loss and wa-
ter inﬁltration. These kind of muds, that contain potas-
sium ions dissolved in the water phase, are widely used
for drilling water-sensitive shales, specially hard, brittle
shales. Potassium cations in these systems replace ions
such as sodium found in most shales to produce less hy-
drated clays with signiﬁcantly reduced swelling potential.
These ions also help to hold the cuttings together, min-
imizing their dispersion into ﬁner particles. From all of
the previous facts, a good understanding of the role of
potassium in the swelling clays such as montmorillonite
is mandatory, in particular at basin conditions of hard
experimental implementation.

Besides the experimental studies, computer simula-
tions are essential components of research on clay-water-
cation systems1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13. These simulations
give microscopic insights that are diﬃcult to access ex-
perimentally. There are, however, not many computa-
tional studies on the swelling of montmorillonite hydrates
for potassium interlayer cations14,15,16,17,18,19,20. In ad-
dition, excluding Hensen et al.7,17 and Tambach et al.20
works, these papers report solely N PzzT and N V T sim-
ulations, where the number of water molecules per in-
terlaminar space is someway arbitrarily ﬁxed, and hence,
they do not show the whole picture of swelling. A good
example of this is that hysteresis is naturally predicted by
sampling in an open ensemble4,7,21, without the need of
measuring properties such as water chemical potential9,

immersion energies13, or swelling free energies12,22. Fi-
nally, this paper focuses on the stability of the diﬀerent
hydrates in contact with several reservoirs, which diﬀer
in temperature, pressure, and water activity.

The importance of potassium as swelling inhibitor of
clays and the above mentioned reasons motivated us to
study the microscopic mechanisms underlying the behav-
ior of K-montmorillonite hydrates at equilibrium with
diﬀerent reservoirs. We performed simulations of these
systems in the N PzzT and µPzzT ensembles, considering
explicitly two clay layers in the simulation box to avoid
ﬁnite size eﬀects. The simulations were carried out for
two condition sets. One at ground level, with P= 1 atm
and T= 298K, and the other one with P= 600 atm and
T= 394K, which corresponds to an average burial depth
close to 4 km.

The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we brieﬂy
describe the models and the methodology employed for
performing the simulations. The results are shown in
Sec. III. Finally, Sec. IV discusses the main results and
extracts some conclusions.

2 layer of Wyoming type montmorillonite clay
was built up by replication of the unit cell given by Skip-
per et al.23. This layer has Lx = 21.12 ˚A, Ly = 18.28
˚A and Lz = 6.56 ˚A dimensions. The Wyoming type
montmorillonite was obtained by isomorphous substitu-
tions of trivalent Al atoms of the octahedral sites by
divalent Mg atoms, and tetravalent Si by trivalent Al
atoms. The unit cell formula of this clay is given by

fects were avoided by considering two layers in the simu-
lation box4. Periodic boundary conditions were imposed
on the three space directions. The initial conﬁguration
consists of water molecules randomly placed in the in-
terlaminar spaces, and six potassium ions distributed in
the interlayer midplanes. These counterions balance the
negative charge of the clay framework keeping the system

On the other hand, the K-H2O interactions and those
between the oxygens of the clay and potassium ions are
based on the ones proposed by Bounds26. Bounds poten-
tial is chosen since, while simple, it produces K-TIP4P
radial distribution functions in agreement with available
experimental data and close to those obtained by hybrid
quantum mechanics/ molecular mechanics (QM/MM)
simulations, which naturally account for the many body
contributions to the potential27. That is, the K-O radial
distribution function peaks at 2.86 ˚A leading to a ﬁrst
shell oxygen coordination number of 7.6, while high ac-
curacy QM/MM simulations performed at density func-
tional theory level (LANL2DZ basis set) give 2.81 ˚A
of K-O distance and 8.3 of coordination number. Ex-
perimental results give K-O distances between 2.7 and
3.1 ˚A and coordination numbers in the wide range of
4-828,29. He ﬁtted the following pair potential for the
K-H2O dispersion-repulsion contribution obtained from

intersite potential, although somewhat more complicated
than the Lennard-Jones type, produces a much better
match to the ab-initio data26. This is clearly seen if one
tries to ﬁt equation (4) with a Lennard-Jones type po-
tential. In fact, parameters shown in table I for potas-
sium were obtained by this way, yielding a not very good
match although reproducing the depth and position of
the pair-potential minimum. We observed that the dis-
crepancies are very pronounced at short distances, where
the Lennard-Jones potential shows a much harder be-
havior. This explains why Boek et al.
found a very
large dehydrated interlaminar space when they employed
a Lennard-Jones type pair potential for K-O14. Natu-
rally, they overcome this diﬃculty by employing the pair
potential proposed by Bounds26.

Nevertheless, since it is crucial for the hybrid Monte
Carlo simulations to keep the energy ﬂuctuations as low
as possible in order to enlarge the acceptation rate30, it is
convenient to avoid employing relatively long range pair
r−4, if no Ewald treat-
potential contributions such as
ment is applied on them. Hence, we reﬁtted to equation

term the acceptance rate enlarges more than three times
for a small (inner) time step of 0.8 fs. In general, both
functions yield similar values of the K-H2O potential en-
ergy. Minima are located practically at the same dis-
tance although the depth of the ﬁtted function is 5%
larger. For larger distances this diﬀerence decreases. To
check the obtained interaction potential, a N P T simula-
tion containing 216 water molecules, a potassium cation,
and a chloride anion was performed at P =1 atm and
T=293 K. The corresponding K-O and K-H radial distri-
bution functions, g(r), and coordination numbers, n(r),
were studied. These functions were observed to be very
similar to those reported by Bounds26. That is, the K-O
and K-H main peaks are located at 2.83 and 3.29 ˚A re-
spectively, which compare well with their corresponding
values of 2.86 and 3.32 ˚A26. The coordination number for

∼

the g(r) minimum was found at 7.7 ˚A, in agreement with
his value of 7.6 ˚A26. Moreover, all these values are even
closer to the results obtained by QM/MM simulations27.
Hence, expression 5 seems to be suitable for our purposes.
Finally, we should mention that electrostatic contribu-
r−1, were treated trough the implementation of
tions,
the Ewald summation formalism. Here the convergence
factor was ﬁxed to 5.6/Lmin, where Lmin is the mini-
mum simulation box side. There were set ﬁve reciprocal
lattice vectors for the directions along the shortest sides
and six vectors for the direction along the largest side31.
The dispersion-repulsion contributions were corrected us-
ing the standard methods for homogeneous ﬂuids32 and
a spherical cutoﬀ of Lmin/2 was imposed.

B. Simulations

Simulations were performed employing the hybrid
Monte Carlo (HMC) method21,30. This technique allows
making global moves while keeping a high average ac-
ceptance probability. Global moves are done as follows
from molecular dynamics (MD), i. e., by assigning ve-
locities and by using a particular scheme for integrat-
ing the Newton’s equations of motion. Velocities are as-
signed randomly from a Gaussian distribution in corre-
spondence with the imposed temperature, and in such
a way that total momentum equals zero for both inter-
laminar spaces. To fulﬁll detail balance condition, the
discretization scheme must be time reversible and area
preserving30.
In particular, we employed the multiple
time scale algorithm given by Tuckerman and Berne33.
This algorithm has the property of splitting the forces
into short and long range. The Lennard-Jones contribu-
tion plus the real part of the electrostatic forces are set
as short range and the reciprocal space contribution of
the electrostatic forces is set as long range. To decrease
time correlations a new conﬁguration is generated each
10 integration steps. The probability to accept this new
conﬁguration is given by

P = min

β∆

{

)
}

H

(6)

H

where ∆
is the diﬀerence between the new and previ-
ous conﬁguration Hamiltonians, and β is the inverse of
the thermal energy. The long time step is set to 8 times
the short time step, and the short time step is chosen to
obtain an average acceptance probability of 0.730. This
way, we obtained short time steps close to 1.0 and 0.5
f s for systems containing 10 and 100 water molecules
per interlaminar space, respectively. As can be seen, the
time step shortens with increasing the system size, since
energy ﬂuctuations enlarge. This is why HMC is not very
eﬃcient for systems counting on a large number of mov-
able sites. This is not our case, since few ions and water
molecules are the only contributors to energy ﬂuctua-
tions. This makes HMC a reasonable choice. In fact, the
time steps we are obtaining are similar to those usually
employed for typical MD calculations5,11,20,25.

For sampling in the N PzzT ensemble, after a trial
change of particles’ positions, a box change is attempted
in such a way that the stress normal to the surface of
the clays, Pzz, is kept constant. For this purpose, box
ﬂuctuations are allowed only in the z-direction and the
probability for accepting the new box conﬁguration is
given by

P = min

Here, ∆

the volume change, N is the total number of molecules,
and Vn and Vo are the new and old box volumes,

For sampling in an open ensemble, the possibility of
insertions and deletions of water molecules has to be con-
sidered. Water insertions and deletions were performed
by Rosenbluth sampling17,21. The µPzzT ensemble21 was
used to obtain the equilibrium states when the system is
in contact with a reservoir at certain temperature, pres-
sure and water chemical potential. For this purpose, the
algorithm must sample the probability density of ﬁnding
the system in a particular conﬁguration, i. e.

µPzzT

Hence, particle movements, insertions, deletions, and box
changes must be done as in a typical N V T , µV T and
N PzzT sampling34. In particular, after trying a change
of particles’ positions, we performed tries of inserting-
deleting water molecules. This is done by randomly call-
ing both possible trials in such a way that calls are equally
probable. Since accepting insertions or deletions are rare,
we repeat this step 10 times or until any insertion or
deletion is accepted. In case of refusing the 10 insertion-
deletion trials, we performed a box trial move35. In this
way, the system rapidly evolves to an equilibrium state.
For some conditions, however, two free energy local min-
ima appear, which are accessed by handling initial con-
ditions.

III. RESULTS

Results are presented in two subsections. These are
Sampling in the N PzzT ensemble and Sampling in the
µPzzT ensemble. Each part presents the results for
ground level conditions, i. e., T = 298 K and P = 1 atm;
and for 4 km of burial depth, i. e., T = 394 K and P =
600 atm, assuming average gradients of 30 K/km and 150
atm/km.

FIG. 1:
water molecules per interlaminar space.

Interlaminar distance as a function of the number of

function of the number of water molecules obtained by
N PzzT simulations. This curve starts from a dehydrated
state having a interlaminar distance of 10.4 ˚A, which is
somewhat larger than the experimental value of 10.1 ˚A36.
For a small number of water molecules, the system reach
interlaminar distances above 11 ˚A, which slightly increase
with increasing the number of water molecules produc-
ing a plateau. This plateau shows interlaminar distances
in the range 11.3 – 12.3 ˚A, which are clearly lower than
those produced by Na-montmorillonite4,9. This might
be seen as something unexpected, since potassium ions
are much larger than sodium ions. As we comment
ahead, this is due to the diﬀerent interlayer structures
that sodium and potassium ions generate. For 60 water
molecules per interlaminar space, there is a jump from a
single water layer to a double water layer, which yields
an interlaminar distance of 13.9 ˚A. For larger amounts
of water the system increases almost linearly, producing
a very small step when jumping from a double to a triple
water layer structure.

Our ﬁndings are similar to those reported by Boek
et al.14. We included them in ﬁgure 1 to make easy the
comparison. It is seen that trends are practically equal.
This indicates that diﬀerences in models and methods
are not very important. Nevertheless, they always obtain
slightly smaller interlaminar distances for a given number
of water molecules. This diﬀerence is always lower than
2%, except for the dehydrated state and the points close
to 100 water molecules, where diﬀerences close to 5% are
observed. Since in our case the jump from a single to
a double layer is obtained for a lower amount of inter-
laminar water, the points that correspond to 55-60 water
molecules also show a larger diﬀerence. Anyway, diﬀer-
ences seem reasonable taking into account the diﬀerences
in pair potential deﬁnitions, box sizes, and methodolo-
gies.

containing 40 water molecules per interlaminar space is
shown in ﬁgure 2. A high and narrow oxygen peak at
the interlaminar midplane, three hydrogen peaks, one
coinciding with the oxygen peak and the other two sym-
metrically situated at both sides, and a single potas-
sium ion peak, also at the interlaminar midplane, are ob-
served. Most of these results agree with others previously
reported14,16,17. It should be noted that this structure
contrasts with that one of the Na-montmorillonite single
layer hydrate. In this case, sodium ions are distributed
at the sides of the oxygen peaks, closer to the clay sheets,
some of them being strongly attached to the clay surface
and so, forming inner-sphere surface complexes15. This
makes water molecules to cluster in two layers joined at
the interlaminar midplane, producing an oxygen double
peak21,37. Naturally, this eﬀect widens the interlaminar
space, despite of the smaller size of sodium ion.

The radial distribution functions and coordination
numbers for K-O sites were also studied. Main g(r) peaks
are situated at 2.77, 2.90, and 2.83 ˚A for water, clay, and
total oxygen sites, respectively. Although they are close
to the one observed for bulk potassium water solution,
a contraction is seen for the K-O water distance as a
consequence of conﬁnement. On the other hand, the rel-
atively large K-O clay distance is due to the distribution
of the potassium ions around the midplane of the inter-
layer space. The coordination numbers for the ﬁrst shell
of oxygen atoms are 5.1, 5.0, and 10.1 for water, clay,
and total oxygen sites, respectively. The clay and total
coordination numbers are somewhat inﬂated due to the
smaller separation of the O-O sites of the clay. This ex-
plains why the total coordination number is larger than
the one found for bulk. It should be noted the large con-
tribution of the clay to the total coordination number.
This suggests that potassium ions are interacting with

both clay sheets at the same time. In addition, the large
K-O clay distance may be indicating that potassium ions
are directly contributing to attract both layers toward
the midplane, and hence holding the sheets close to one
another.

All the already pointed features are illustrated in ﬁg-
ure 3. For instance, it is observed that potassium ions
are practically centered on the interlayer midplane with
an approximate average of 5 water molecules surrounding
each ion. It is also possible to see how ions tend to sepa-
rate from each other, and that one of them is always close
to a tetrahedral aluminum (these sites are not highlighted
in the ﬁgure). Moreover, it is shown that there are no
water molecules interposed between the potassium ions
and the clay sheets. Hence, potassium ions are behaving
as inner-sphere complexes, but simultaneously with both
clay layers. To see this even clearer, ﬁgure 4 was built
by rotating and zooming in ﬁgure 3. Here, a potassium
ion and its inner water shell are shown. As can be seen,
only 5 water molecules surround the ion that coordinates
with two oxygen atoms from each clay. For this particu-
lar case, are also seen average K-O distances of 2.81 and
3.04 ˚A for water and clay, respectively.

As mentioned before, for 60 water molecules a dou-
ble layer hydrate is formed. This double layer hydrate
becomes fully developed for 80 water molecules, where

an interlayer distance close to 15.0 ˚A is observed. For
this system, the oxygen, hydrogen, and potassium pro-
ﬁles are shown in ﬁgure 5. Here, the two oxygen peaks
are a signature of the double water layer structure. For
each oxygen peak a potassium peak and two hydrogen
peaks are found. The potassium peak is found almost
coinciding with the oxygen peak, but slightly displaced
at the side closer to the clay sheet. This suggests the for-
mation of inner-sphere complexes. On the other hand,
a small hydrogen peak is found at the side closer to the
clay sheet, and a larger one closer to the interlaminar

midplane. Hence, the third hydrogen peak found for the
one layer case is missing here.

For this conﬁguration, main g(r) peaks are located at
2.83, 2.75, and 2.79 ˚A for water, clay, and total oxygen
sites, respectively. Hence, the K-O distance for water is
not contracted anymore, but equal to the bulk water K-
O distance. On the contrary, the K-O distance for the
clay decreased 0.17 ˚A. Moreover, this distance is found
to be almost constant for systems having more than 60
water molecules, strongly suggesting that this is the nat-
ural average K-O distance for a potassium ion attached
to the siloxane surface. Hence, the distance found for
the single layer hydrate would be elongated as a result
of the pressure the water molecules produce on the clay
surfaces. The corresponding coordination numbers are
6.8, 2.8, and 9.6 for water, clay, and total oxygen sites,
respectively. As can be seen, the coordination number
for the clay is much lower than the value found for the
single layer hydrate. This means that potassium ions are
coordinated to only one clay layer for the double layer hy-
drate. Finally, and as expected, K-O water coordination
numbers increase with the number of water molecules,
whereas K-O clay and K-O total coordination numbers
decrease. A snapshot of this two layer hydrate is shown
in ﬁgure 6. We should mention that the structure of the
inner-sphere complexes we found in this case are very
similar to those already reported by Sposito et al.19 (not
shown here).

For burial conditions the interlaminar distance in-
creases for a given number of water molecules per inter-
laminar space. This is shown in ﬁgure 7, where it shows
the interlaminar distance as a function of the number
of water molecules for burial and for ground level con-
ditions. This increment is more pronounced for large
amounts of water. This is an expected behavior since
water molecules occupy larger eﬀective volumes at burial
conditions9. Consequently, proﬁles turn less sharp, i. e.,
peaks broad and shorten, as it is shown in ﬁgure 8.
This was seen experimentally by Skipper et al., although
for a Na-montmorillonite system38. On the other hand,
trends for both the ground and burial data are very sim-
ilar, i. e., jumps are found at equal numbers of water

Sampling in this ensemble allows the system to reach

We employed the expression βµ = βµ0 + ln(p/p0), where

whereas the solid line is the average. Initial conditions were
16 ˚A and 60 water molecules per interlaminar space. Estab-
lished conditions were T=298 K, P=1 atm, and p/po=0.4.

pressure. For the TIP4P water model with T =298 K
and P =1 atm, we employed βµ0=-17.4. This value was
obtained by N P T simulations of bulk TIP4P water21
and using the Rosenbluth sampling method explained
elsewhere17,34.
It is in good agreement with the value
reported by Ch´avez-P´aez et al.4, and it is 2.5% larger
than the one reported by Tambach et al.20. For T =394
K and P =600 atm, βµ0=-13.4 was obtained21.

The evolution of the interlaminar distance and num-
ber of water molecules for ground level conditions and
for p/po=0.4 is shown in ﬁgure 9. Here, the initial condi-
tions were 16 ˚A for the interlaminar distance and 60 wa-
ter molecules per interlaminar space. It is observed that
the system reaches approximately 65 water molecules and
14.3 ˚A of interlaminar distance at the initial simulation
steps. This happens so fast since the system is initially
very far from equilibrium. Immediately after, the system
starts slowly loosing water molecules and decreasing its
interlaminar distance on its way toward equilibrium. It
is observed that, once the system reaches 13.5 ˚A of in-
terlaminar space, it quickly falls down to 12.2 ˚A, loosing
many water molecules during the process. This is a sig-
nature of the transition from a double layer hydrate to
a single layer hydrate. The amount of water that sig-
nals the transition goes from 55 to 45 molecules. This
agrees with the N PzzT results, where a single to a dou-
ble layer transition is observed in the range of 40 - 60
water molecules and 12.2 - 14.3 ˚A. After the transition,
it is observed that the system takes several steps to ﬁnally
reach equilibrium at approximately 40000 steps. In this
case, sampling was performed in the step range of 40000
- 70000. For this particular run 12.0 ˚A of interlaminar
space and 39.3 water molecules were obtained.

Many runs were performed in order to build up ﬁg-

≤

ure 10. Here it is seen the interlaminar distance and
number of water molecules at equilibrium with reservoirs
having diﬀerent water vapor pressures and for ground
level conditions. For zero vapor pressure, no matter what
the established initial conditions, the system is forced to
eliminate all of its water content, and so, the dehydrated
state is yielded. This has 10.40 ˚A of interlaminar space,
as was found in the preceding section. For increasing
the vapor pressure, the system starts to uptake water
molecules from the reservoir producing larger interlam-
inar distances. Nevertheless, the ﬁrst water layer satu-
rates for vapor pressures over 0.2p0 and so, a plateau is
generated. Again, this single layer hydrate is produced
for p/p0

0.4 for all initial conditions.

For higher vapor pressures, however, at least two equi-
librium states are yielded. That is, depending on the
established initial conditions, the system may produce
a double or a single layer hydrate. Hence, the topmost
lines of both plots of ﬁgure 10 correspond to an initial
conﬁguration of 60 water molecules and the others to an
initial conﬁguration of 10 water molecules. These two
equilibrium states are stable up to water vapor satu-
ration, producing an open hysteresis cycle. The single
layer state yields interlaminar distances ranging in 11.82
- 12.06 ˚A and amounts of water in the range of 30.1 - 41.8
molecules. The double layer state produces interlaminar
distances in the range 14.91 - 15.16 ˚A and numbers of wa-
ter molecules ranging in 76.7 - 80.6. These data contrast
with those obtained for Na-montmorillonite21.
In this
case, both initial conditions predict only a single layer hy-
0.2. In addition, this single layer hydrate
drate for p/p0
yields values of the interlaminar distance in the range
of 12.34 - 12.73 ˚A, having 34.6-47.5 water molecules21.
Therefore, it becomes evident the K-montmorillonite ten-

≤

dency to produce single layer hydrates even for relatively
high vapor pressures, and the small interlaminar distance
and amounts of water it yields. On the other hand, the
double layer plateaus for potassium and sodium do not
behave very diﬀerently for high vapor pressures.

We should also compare our results with the experi-
mental data obtained by B´erend et al.39, Calvet36, and
Sato et al.40. For this purpose, these data are also in-
cluded in ﬁgure 10. It should be pointed out that these
data are direct measurements of interlaminar distances
against the relative vapor pressure. This contrasts with
the experimental data presented in ﬁgure 1, which were
obtained by combining diﬀerent experimental techniques
and introducing some assumptions. Here, B´erend et al.’s
data were obtained as the evolution of the interlaminar
distance for a dehydration process, by starting from a
double or a single layer hydrate. Similarly, Calvet present
his data by starting from a double or a single layer hy-
drate, but for a hydration process. Sato et al.’s data are
also obtained by hydration.

The best agreement between our simulations and ex-
periments is produced when comparing with the data of
B´erend et al.39 We highlight the double layer hydrate for-
mation for the range of relative vapor pressures of 0.6 -
1.0; the single layer hydrate which keeps stable even for
saturated vapor pressures; the very good agreement for
the basal space for the single layer hydrate; and the rel-
ative good agreement for the double layer hydrate inter-
laminar distance, close to 15.5 ˚A. Calvet’s data also are
in general agreement with our simulations. He observed
a very stable single layer hydrate, with interlaminar dis-
tances ranging in 11.8-12.5 ˚A. Nevertheless, he obtained
a very unstable double layer hydrate. Only for relative
vapor pressures of 0.9 - 1.0 this hydrate was observed. Its
interlaminar distance is in the range of 15.2-16.0 ˚A. Sato
et al.’s data also lead to similar interlaminar distances for
the single and double layer hydrate. Finally, the single
layer hydrate interlaminar distances also well agree with
data reported by Brindley and Brown41. For 0.32, 0.52,
and 0.79p0 of vapor pressure they reported 11.9, 11.9 and
12.1 ˚A, respectively.

On the other hand, the most important discrepancy
with experiments is that they obtained interlaminar dis-
tances close to 10.0 ˚A for the dehydrated state, which
seems to be stable up to a relative vapor pressure rang-
ing from 0.1 to 0.3. We think that if we were capable of
reproducing the correct dehydrated distance, i. e. 10.0 in-
stead of 10.4 ˚A, this state would probably become stable
for small vapor pressures, as they found.

Experimentalists agree that for relative vapor pres-
sures ranging in 0.0 - 0.4, a mixture of the dehydrated
state and the single layer hydrate coexist, i. e. there is
interstratiﬁcation. Similarly, they observed the coexis-
tence of double and single layer hydrates, for high rel-
ative vapor pressures. In fact, Calvet refers to his own
data as “apparent distances”; B´erend et al. conclude that
all montmorillonites (they studied Li, Na, K, Rb and Cs-
montmorillonites) form interstratiﬁed hydrates; and Sato

et al. observed several “nonintegral basal reﬂections”,
which are interpreted as “random or segregated-type in-
terstratiﬁcation of collapsed and expanded layers”. An
example is the 13.81 ˚A of interlaminar distance he ob-
tained for the relative vapor pressure of 0.9. This point
does not match either a single or a double hydrate in-
terlaminar distance, as it is clearly seen in ﬁgure 10. It
is important to mention that the general belief is that
interstratiﬁcation occurs due to chemical heterogeneities
of the clay layers. It was already proven by simulations
that changes on the positions of the clay substitutions
produce diﬀerent interlaminar distances (although dif-
ferences are not very pronounced)3. Hence, these het-
erogeneities surely lead to quasihomogeneous states, and
probably, to interstratiﬁed ones. On the other hand, a
perfect system like ours shows the double and the sin-
gle layer hydrates to be stable for identical conditions.
Hence, we do not see any reason for this not to occur in
a real system. In other words, we think that this is an-
other source of interstratiﬁcation, which arises just as a
consequence of the inherent thermodynamics of the per-
fect system. In fact, similar conclusions are deduced by
Tambach et al.22.

Table II shows the main peak positions and the ﬁrst
shell coordination numbers for the systems equilibrated
at diﬀerent relative vapor pressures, and for a single and
a double water layer conﬁgurations. This was done to
prove that the shifts of the water and clay peaks men-
tioned in the preceding section are indeed signiﬁcant over
a wide range of vapor pressures. As can be seen for the
single layer hydrate, the K-O water clay position is prac-
tically constant and equal to the one found from the
N PzzT sampling. Also the double layer pw is close to
the value found in the previous section, i. e., similar to
the K-O bulk water position. On the other hand, pc in-
creases for increasing the relative water pressure, reach-
ing a plateau for p/p0
0.3. The plateau value is close
to 2.89 ˚A, which is also similar to the value found in
the preceding section. The decrease of this distance with
p/p0 is a consequence of the decrease of the interlaminar
distance with it. For the double layer conﬁguration it is

also conﬁrmed a value close to 2.76 ˚A. Hence, the shifts
of these peaks are relevant, and not just casual values
obtained for some particular conditions. From table II it
is seen that the values for the coordination numbers also
agree with those presented in the previous section.

To evaluate the eﬀect of the burial depth on the K-
montmorillonite swelling curves, ﬁgure 11 was built for
T =394 K and P =600 atm. Additionally, results for
ground level conditions were included to make the com-
parison easy. As can be seen, for initial conditions of 10
water molecules and a small interlaminar space, the inter-
laminar distance is slightly smaller than those obtained
for ground level conditions. This combines with the fact
that water molecules occupy a larger eﬀective volume for
burial conditions and so, the number of water molecules
decreases.
In other words, the single layer hydrate of
K-montmorillonite dehydrates under burial conditions.
Furthermore, this single layer hydrate is stable even for
a saturated water vapor pressure. Again, this contrasts
with the results we obtained for Na-montmorillonite21,
where the single layer hydrate was found to be unsta-
ble for large water activities. Moreover, for p/p0 = 1.0,
the K-montmorillonite single layer hydrate yields 12.07
˚A of interlaminar space and 40.4 water molecules, which
seems to be far from the transition range of 45 to 55
water molecules previously found.

The double layer hydrate behaves diﬀerently. That
is, it keeps constant its water content and it slightly in-
creases its interlaminar distance. As found for ground
level conditions, it collapses forming the single layer hy-
drate for p/p0 < 0.6. On the other hand, for a satu-
rated vapor pressure the system monotonically increases

last case we stopped the simulations when reaching 180
water molecules, and thus, we assumed that the system
entered the osmotic regime.

In summary, these results indicate that once formed
the K-montmorillonite single water hydrate will not be
destabilized neither at ground level conditions nor at
burial depths.
In addition, if the reservoir vapor pres-
sure fells down 0.4p0 the single water hydrate will form.

Single and double layer hydrates of K-montmorillonite
were studied by means of N PzzT and µPzzT simulations.
For that purpose a hybrid Monte Carlo scheme was em-
ployed. Most results from the N PzzT sampling just con-
ﬁrm those previously reported elsewhere14,15,17,18,19, sug-
gesting that diﬀerences in models and methods are not
very important.

We found diﬀerent clay-water-ion complexes for the
single water hydrate. They consist of an average of 5
water molecules surrounding a potassium ion that ad-
ditionally coordinates with two oxygen atoms of each
closest clay layer. These potassium ions are placed at
the interlayer midplane and so, distances between them
and the oxygens of the clay are slightly larger than those
observed for the double layer hydrate. It should be men-
tioned that these midplane ions were reported by pre-
vious works as forming outer-sphere complexes14,16. In
fact, Chang et al.16 found that these midplane ions have
a relatively large mobility, since potassium ions neither
strongly coordinate to water molecules nor strongly inter-
act with the clay surfaces. This is, indeed, characteristic
of an outer-sphere complex. This explains why they call
them in this way. Nonetheless, the inner-sphere deﬁnition
given elsewhere15 says literally “The surface complex is
inner-sphere if the cation is bound directly to a cluster of
surface oxygen ions, with no water molecules interposed”.
Accordingly, our midplane potassium ions form inner-
sphere complexes but simultaneously with both clay lay-
ers. Nevertheless, we expect them to have a diﬀusivity
similar to that reported by Chang et al.15. This is a clear
diﬀerence between this kind of inner-sphere complex and
the typical inner-sphere complex, where ions are strongly
coordinated to one of the surfaces15. This simultaneous
coordination of potassium ions with oxygen atoms of the
two adjacent clay layers plus their relatively large coordi-
nation distances, suggests to us that these complexes are
attracting the clay layers toward the interlayer midplane,
aiding to keep them together.

Although the previous ﬁnding seems to explain the sta-
bility of the single layer hydrate found experimentally,
we should also reproduce computationally this behavior.
Hence, µPzzT simulations were carried out. This en-
semble lets interchange water with a given reservoir and
volume ﬂuctuations. So, for any given water vapor pres-
sure of the reservoir, an average amount of water and an
average interlaminar distance are found. However, two
diﬀerent equilibrium states may be produced, pointing
to the formation of free energy local minima20, which are
accessed by handling initial conditions. This produces

hysteresis loops20. We found that for initial conditions
close to the dehydrated state, a single water layer is al-
ways obtained for any non zero vapor pressure, signatur-
ing its high stability. The amount of water of this single
layer slightly increases as the vapor pressure increases.
This was obtained for ground level and burial conditions.
The interlaminar distance for the ground level state is al-
ways close to 12.0 ˚A. The number of water molecules was
found to be close to 38 for ground level conditions and
about 36 for burial conditions. This is due to the larger
eﬀective volume the water molecules occupy at higher
temperatures.

On the other hand, the stability of the double layer hy-
drate diﬀers from that one of the single layer. For both
conditions studied, it was seen that the double layer col-
lapses to form the single layer for vapor pressures under
0.4p0. In addition, this double layer was found to be un-
stable for burial depth and for saturated vapor pressures,
producing a hydrated state in the osmotic regime.

We should point out that these results agree with those
of Boek et al.14. In their ﬁgure 3 is shown the potential
energy of the interlayer water as a function of the num-
ber of water molecules. It can be seen that the potassium
curve is very diﬀerent than the sodium and lithium ones
only for small amounts of water (it shows much higher
energy values, even well above the water bulk reference).
This supports our ﬁnding of an extremely stable single
water hydrate. Nevertheless, they claim that potassium
is a good swelling inhibitor due to its ability to migrate
and bind to the clay surfaces for large amounts of water.
Hence, the negatively charged surface becomes screened,
making its inherent repulsion less eﬀective. We agree
that this mechanism explains the relatively high stabil-
ity of double layer hydrates, and even explains the stabil-
ity of K-montmorillonite hydrates in the osmotic regime.
Nevertheless, it cannot explain the remarkable stability
of the single layer hydrate, since at least a double layer is

10

needed to obtain the binding between ions and surfaces.
This fact makes us think that midplane potassium ions
are playing an important role in the stability of single
layer hydrates.

Despite of thinking that the potassium simultaneously
binding to adjacent layers is the key to the single layer
hydrate stability, we do not think it is the only factor.
Lowest interaction energy for the pair K-TIP4P water is
close to -20 kcal, which is higher than that for Na-TIP4P
of approximately -25 kcal. This means that potassium
ion does not strongly interact with water and therefore,
it easily loses water from its coordination shell. In other
words, the water chemical potential of the interlayer is
not very negative. That is, water may be more comfort-
able in bulk than in the interlayer, surrounding the ions.
As mentioned by Sposito et al.19, potassium ions show a
kind of “hydrophobic character”, in the sense that they
tend to interact with water molecules not only through
their positive charge but also through solvent cage for-
mation. Consequently, some of the water oxygen atoms
may be easily exchanged by oxygen atoms from the clay
surface.

Finally, for drilling purposes and based on our results,
it seems to not be enough to add potassium to the mud in
order to guarantee the single layer water formation and,
in this way, avoid swelling. One should simultaneously
decrease the mud water activity to safely produce the
single layer state. Once obtained, the clay will not swell
at all.

We develop a quasi-chemical theory for the study of packing thermodynamics in dense liquids.
The situation of hard-core interactions is addressed by considering the binding of solvent molecules
to a precisely deﬁned ‘cavity’ in order to assess the probability that the ‘cavity’ is entirely evacuated.
The primitive quasi-chemical approximation corresponds to a extension of the Poisson distribution
used as a default model in an information theory approach. This primitive quasi-chemical theory is in
good qualitative agreement with the observations for the hard sphere ﬂuid of occupancy distributions
that are central to quasi-chemical theories but begins to be quantitatively erroneous for the equation
of state in the dense liquid regime of ρd3 >0.6. How the quasi-chemical approach can be iterated to
treat correlation eﬀects is addressed. Consideration of neglected correlation eﬀects leads to a simple
model for the form of those contributions neglected by the primitive quasi-chemical approximation.
These considerations, supported by simulation observations, identify a ‘break away’ phenomena
that requires special thermodynamic consideration for the zero (0) occupancy case as distinct from
the rest of the distribution. A empirical treatment leads to a one parameter model occupancy
distribution that accurately ﬁts the hard sphere equation of state and observed distributions.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The quasi-chemical theory[1, 2, 3] is a fresh attack on
the molecular statistical thermodynamic theory of liq-
uids. It is intended to be speciﬁcally appropriate in de-
scribing liquids of genuinely chemical interest. But, in
view of its generality, the quasi-chemical theory must be
developed and tested for its description of the paradig-
matic hard sphere ﬂuid. In addition to the conceptual
point, these developments are expected to be helpful in
subsequent applications of the quasi-chemical theory to
real solutions.

The foundational virtues of the hard sphere ﬂuid for
the theory of liquids are widely recognized[4] and the
interest in this system continues to evolve[5, 6, 7, 8]. Re-
cent developments of the theory of hydrophobic eﬀects[3,
9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20],
in ad-
dition the related quasi-chemical theory, have empha-
sized again the signiﬁcance of packing issues in a re-
alistic molecular description of complex liquids. This
paper studies the hard sphere ﬂuid and develops de-
fault models with utility in recent information theory
approaches[3, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21].

A compact derivation requires several preliminary re-
sults, including brief speciﬁcations of the potential dis-
tribution theorem, of the expression of chemical equi-
librium, and of the quasi-chemical formulation. Addi-
tionally, the notation here is not elsewhere standardized
because these ideas are unconventional. The plan of the
paper is thus to collect the necessary preliminary results
in Appendix A so that the conceptual argument needn’t

be interrupted. Then we derive the new equation of state
format, learn what we can by comparison of the primitive
quasi-chemical approximation with Monte Carlo simula-
tion results, study correlation contributions to propose
an improved equation of state format, and ﬁnally exam-
ine how this improved format works.

Interestingly, though the some of these basic consider-
ations are regarded as ‘preliminary,’ Eqs. 2 or 4, and the
formal identiﬁcation of the equibrium ratio Eq. A4, have
been given before and have wide generality.

II. A QUASI-CHEMICAL VIEW OF THE
SOLVATION FREE ENERGY OF HARD CORE
SOLUTES

The preliminary results of Appendix A permit an
attack on the solvation thermodynamics of hard core
species built upon a simple device. Let’s consider a so-
lute A that doesn’t interact with the solvent S molecules
at all. We will consider formation of ASn complexes and
Fig. 1 depicts such a cluster. The interaction contribu-
tion β∆µA is zero and the quasi-chemical Eq. A5 ex-

taken as deﬁning a physically interesting molecule pair

negative of the excess chemical potential for the hard
core solute deﬁned by bAj. This is an example of the well
known relation for hard core solutes ln p0 = −β∆µHC
with ‘HC’ denoting ‘hard core’[3, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14,
15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]. This observation sheds light on the
compensation of inner and outer sphere contributions to
the quasi-chemical Eq. A5 but is not surprising. We then
consider ‘chemical’ equilibria for binding of S molecules
to the A molecule. Of course, there is no interaction be-
tween the A molecule and the solvent molecules. The
binding is just the occupancy by a solvent molecules of
the ‘cavity’ deﬁned by bAj. Combining these considera-

ering the hard disk (2d) and hard sphere ﬂuids (3d). Ta-

cases. The predicted distributions xn for two densities
are in Figs. 2 and 3. Equation of state results β∆µ(ρ) for
these systems predicted by this primitive quasi-chemical
theory are shown in Figs. 4 and 5. The primitive quasi-
chemical approximation is remarkably successfully in all
qualitative respects, particularly in view of its simplic-
ity. In particular, the predicted occupancy distributions
such as shown in Fig. 3 are remarkably faithful to the
data. Nevertheless, the equation of state predictions be-
gin progressively to incur serious quantitative errors at
liquid densities ρd3 > 0.6, (Fig. 5).

IV. TEST OF THE EQUILIBRIUM RATIOS

mechanism, we can focus on testing ideal populations

A point of view here is that the geometric weighting

Iterating the Quasi-Chemical Analysis

theoretical approximation for the equilibrium ratios given

This last equation is signiﬁcant particularly because it
suggests that a principal consequence of correlations can
be a uniform reweighting of all coeﬃcients m≥1. Strik-
ingly, that is exactly the suggestion of Fig. 6.

We can use this insight to push the argument further:
the fact that the primitive quasi-chemical populations
for m≥1 are correct relative to each other means that
0 are nearly exponentially de-
the quantities
pendent on m. For, in the ﬁrst place, when the density
is high, almost all the population is in the center of the
distribution, and the Lagrange multipliers are negligibly
aﬀect by the relative reweighting of the m=0 term. Then
the alteration of the original geometric weighting is liter-
ally irrelevant. In the second place, when the density is
suﬃciently low, these correlation factors are nearly unity
anyway. So we can accurately write

x0 ‘breaks away’ from the rest of the distribution and
requires individual consideration when the density is high
enough that x0 is suﬃciently small due to correlation
eﬀects. Nevertheless

A(ρS) ≈

ζ − 1
ζ0 − 1

,

(12)

where ζ0 is the primitive quasi-chemical approximate
value. Thus, when the primitive quasi-chemical approxi-
mation is suﬃciently accurate, the diﬃculty of evaluating
the corrections should be much reduced.

Though it would be interesting to calculate correlation
corrections on the basis of Eq. 7 and Appendix C, a sim-
pler, empirical approach suﬃces for our present purposes.
This is because the discrepancies seen in Fig. 5 are sub-
stantial but not problematic and, therefore, the required
A(ρS) is simple. In particular, the form

conforms accurately to the Carnahan-Starling equation

obtained by ﬁtting on the basis of the Eq. 12 to minimize
the discrepancy with the Carnahan-Starling equation of
state.

Our ﬁrst goal was to work-out how the quasi-chemical
theory, a fresh attack on the the statistical thermody-
namic theory of liquids, applies to the paradigmatic hard
sphere ﬂuid. The second goal was to work-out theoret-
ical approximation procedures that might assist in de-
scribing dense liquids of non-spherical species. The new
fundamental results here apply generally to ‘hard core’
molecular models. The primitive quasi-chemical approx-
imation, the procedure for iterating the quasi-chemical
analysis, and the recognition of the ‘break away’ phe-
nomenon of Fig. 6 are likely to be helpful in understand-
ing packing in dense molecular liquids, beyond the hard
sphere ﬂuid. For the hard sphere system speciﬁcally, we
have obtained a simple occupancy model, Eq 13, that is
likely to be helpful in a variety of other situations.

One situation is the description of packing restrictions
when the quasi-chemical theory is used to treat genuinely
chemical interactions, for example in the study of hydra-
tion of atomic ions in water[24, 25]. The issue of ‘context
hydrophobicity’ associated with many molecular solutes,
including molecular ions, in water can also be addressed
on the basis of quasi-chemical calculations and the devel-
opments here.

Another situation of current interest is the theory
of primitive hydrophobic eﬀects that has recently been
reborn[3, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20].
An historical view has been that the initial issue of hy-
drophobic eﬀects was the hydration structures and ther-
modynamics following from volume exclusion by non-
polar molecules in liquid water. The balance of at-
tractive forces that might produce drying phenomena
was a secondary concern, except that ‘drying’ was al-
ways present in the scaled particle models[26]. With the
convincing clariﬁcation of the ﬁrst of these problems[3,
9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20], the is-
sue of drying phenomena has been now taken up more
enthusiastically[3, 27, 28]. In this context, we note that
the striking success of the two-moment information mod-
els and the Pratt-Chandler theory[3, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14,
15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 29] is due, in part, to a fortuitous
balance of a ‘gaussian’ approximation in the theory[18]
and a compensating disregard for drying possibilities[30];
both of these compensating approximations are expected
to be benign for small molecule solutes[39]. One ingredi-
ent in a better understanding of this situation is a careful
solution to the case where drying phenomena are entirely
absent. That ingredient is better in hand with the results
above.

APPENDIX A: PRELIMINARY RESULTS

1. Potential Distribution Theorem

The potential distribution theorem[1, 2, 14, 31] may

be expressed as

ρσ =

e−β∆U

0 zσ (qσ/V )

(A1)

(cid:10)(cid:10)

(cid:11)(cid:11)
where ρσ is the density of molecules of type σ (the ‘so-
lute’ under consideration), zσ = exp(βµσ) is the absolute
activity of that species, qσ is the single molecule partition
function for that species, and V is the volume. The dou-
ble brackets hh. . .ii0 indicate the average over the thermal
motion of the solute and the solvent under the conditions
of no interaction between them, and the averaged quan-
tity is the Boltzmann factor of those interactions. The
average indicated here is the ratio of the activity of an
isolated solute, ρσV /qσ, divided by the absolute activity,
zσ, of the actual solute. Thus

βµσ = ln

trivial calculations on many-body systems.

This should be compared to the textbook result for ideal
gas systems[32]. That comparison shows that the sin-
gle molecule partition functions are multiplicatively aug-
mented by the test particle averages[40]. But otherwise
the structure of this important result is unchanged. The
conclusion here is that the equilibrium ratios are well-
deﬁned objects though formal to the extent that non-
trivial computational eﬀort would be required to evaluate
them on the basis of molecular information.

The quasi-chemical develop starts from consideration
of a distinguished molecule in the solution and seeks to
evaluate the chemical potential on the basis of events
occurring within a deﬁned ‘inner sphere.’ For a species of
type A, that deﬁnition is codiﬁed by specifying a function
bAj that is equal to one (1) when solution molecule j is
inside the deﬁned region and zero (0) otherwise. Our
starting point can be [2]

where x0 is the fraction of A solute species with zero (0)

quasi-chemical (or cluster-variation) approximations of
Guggenheim [33], Bethe [34], and Kikuchi [35].

This approach should have greatest utility where the
chemical balances of Eq. A7 are dominated by inner
sphere chemistry that can be captured with computa-
tions on clusters. Such chemical interactions are often
much larger than the outer sphere contribution, the right-
most term of Eq. A5.

But that outer sphere contribution remains and can’t
be neglected forever. An interesting example based
on simulation of liquid water was discussed recently[3].
There the x0 was estimated from molecular dynamics re-
sults and the remainder, the outer-sphere contributions
to β∆µ, were positive, suggesting domination of those
outer-sphere contributions by the packing constraints
studied here. A principal goal of the present work is the
development of a reasonable approach for describing the
packing issues necessary for treating those outer sphere
contributions.

Reiss and Merry[36] analyzed population relations
analogous to Eq. A9 but with activities appearing in the
place of densities and with coeﬃcients, here the equilib-
rium ratios Kn, appropriately diﬀerent. The additional
formal point here is the replacement of the activity by
the density that permits the identiﬁcation of the Kn in
Eq. 2, and then further permits consideration of the mean
ﬁeld treatment Eq. 3 on the basis of an information the-
(0) will be used. At this stage,
ory constraint when Kn
the quasi-chemical approximation achieves a particularly
primitive character and deviates from the goal of bound-
ing these thermodnamic quantities that was pursued by
Reiss and Merry[36].

spatial integral over the volume of the A-ball, a sphere
of radius 1. The indicated integrand is thus 3n dimen-
sional. The integrand is zero (0) if |ri − rj| < 1 (overlap)
for any (ij) and one (1) otherwise. Thus the integral can
be estimated by sampling n-point uniform placments in
the A-ball and scoring the fraction of such placements
that are free from overlaps between the n unit diameter
S-spheres. This approach fails for n larger than those pre-
sented in Table I. But larger clusters were not observed
in our simulation of the ﬂuid, so our approach should be
regarded as satisfactory.

The analogous two dimensional procedure was used for

the hard disk results.

The SS excluded volume, the integrand, is the same as

the average over the structures of the isolated AS′

non-trivial denominator that appears in Eq. C1.

Operationally, the calculation can be much as in Ap-

fully enclose any conformation of the cluster.

APPENDIX D: CALCULATION OF xn FOR THE
HARD SPHERE FLUID

The probability that there are n − 1 points in a sphere
of radius r, xn−1(r), can be obtained from the distri-

8

bution, 4πρSr2Dn(r), of the distance r to the nth near-
est neighbor of an arbitrary point. The probability that
there are no more than n − 1 molecules in the void is
equal to the probability that the nth nearest neighbor is
at least r away from the void center

and large, a speciﬁc point in the simulation volume was
chosen, and the sampling probability was reweighted

is based upon the idea that D(0)
/3 is
the function[37] appropriate for a random distribution
of spheres. This idea attempts to make the observed
distribution of the distance to the nearest particle more
nearly uniform. The constant C was included to avoid an
unbounded weighting function. The denominator of Eq.
D2 is just a normalizing factor on the distribution. The
denominator of Eq. D2 merely provides a normalizing
factor.

Isobaric-isotermal ensembles of 108 and 256 hard
spheres were suﬃcient. The Carnahan-Starling equation
was used to ﬁnd the βp needed for a hard sphere simu-
lation at each speciﬁc density.

[38] This point has a twist for the non-profound one dimen-
sional problem: This primitive quasi-chemical approxi-
mation is exact for the one dimensional ‘hard plate’ sys-
tem. But as a distribution without evaluation of the mean
ﬁeld factors, this distribution is an exceedingly weak the-
ory. Evaluation of the mean ﬁeld produces the exact an-
swer because the number of statistical possibilities is only

9

2. The situation for the continuum analog, the Poisson
distribution, is diﬀerent. It is not accurate as a distribu-
tion and the same information theory interpretation still
gives an incorrect result for the one dimensional hard
plate system.

[39] Another factor is that the dimensionless densities rele-
vant for the ﬁrst hydrophobic applications aren’t as large
as the most diﬃcult cases considered here.

[40] A more conventional view of these results is that the con-
centrations are multiplicatively augmented by the test
particle averages and that serves to identify activity co-
eﬃcients. That point of view has no special utility here.

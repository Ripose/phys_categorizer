Abstract

Using an approach based on many body perturbation theory, the correlation energy Eco is

expressed as an explicit functional of ρ1, v, and vs, where ρ1 is the one-particle density matrix

from the noninteracting, or reference, state; v is the external potential from the interacting, or

target, state; vs is the external potential from the noninteracting state. In other words we have

Eco[ρ1, v, vs]. Anther possibility is the following explicit functional: Eco[ρ1, vco, vs], where vco

is the (kernel of the) correlation potential from the noninteracting Hamiltonian. The method

can, in principle, be used to compute Eco in a very accurate and eﬃcient manner, since, like

the Kohn–Sham approach, there are no excited orbitals to consider. However, unlike the Kohn–

Sham approach, Eco is a known, explicit functional that can be approximated in a systematic

manner. For simplicity, we only consider noninteracting closed-shell states and target states that

are nondegenerate, singlet ground-states; so, in that case, ρ1 denotes the spin-less one-particle

density matrix.

INTRODUCTION

The Kohn-Sham version of density functional theory has been very successful in electronic

structure theory for quantum chemistry and condensed matter physics [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7].

Unlike pure density functional approaches, the Kohn–Sham method uses a set of occupied

orbitals from a noninteracting state, where this determinantal state shares its electronic

density ρ with the target, or interacting, state. In the Kohn–Sham approach, the kinetic

energy (through the) ﬁrst order is not an explicit functional of ρ, but, instead, this functional

depends on the one-particle density matrix ρ1 from the noninteracting, determinantal state.

The Kohn-Sham approach requires as input the exchange-correlation functional Exc—or

equivalently the exchange Ex and correlation energies Eco—where Exc is required to be

an explicit functional of ρ. Unfortunately, Exc is an unknown functional, and there is no

systematic method to improve approximations.

High levels of approximations can be obtained by wave function methods [8, 9, 10, 11],

including the coupled cluster method, many-body perturbation theory, and conﬁguration in-

teraction. Often, however, these methods are much less eﬃcient than the Kohn Sham density

functional approaches, where typically, wave function methods consider a large number of

2-electron molecular integrals depending on both occupied and excited orbitals, and these

integrals must be computed and utilized in calculation that involve large atomic orbital basis

sets.

In order to improve the eﬃciency of these methods, especially in regards to their scaling

with molecular size, perturbative methods have been developed based on localized molecular

orbitals [12, 13, 14, 15, 16]. An alternative approach, pioneered by H¨aser and Alml¨of [17],

uses a Laplace transform to remove the energy denominators in perturbation theory, yielding

approaches involving correlation energy expression that depend explicitly on the atomic

orbital basis set [18]. This method has also been used with the coupled cluster theory [19].

Below we introduce an approach that has features of both wave function methods and

Kohn–Sham density functional theory. The approach is based on many body perturbation

theory [8, 9, 10, 20], where the correlation energy Eco is expressed as an explicit functional

of ρ1, v, and vs, where ρ1 is the one-particle density matrix from the noninteracting, or

reference, state; v is the external potential from the interacting state; vs is the external

potential from the noninteracting state. In other words we have Eco[ρ1, v, vs]. This method

2

can, in principle, be used to compute Eco in a very accurate and eﬃcient manner, since, like

the Kohn–Sham approach, there are no excited orbitals to consider. However, unlike the

Kohn–Sham approach, Eco is a known, explicit functional that can be approximated in a

systematic manner. Like the wave function methods mentioned above, the proposed method

removes the energy denominators by using Laplace transforms, as well as other techniques

to obtain the correlation energy as an explicit functional of ρ1, v, and vs. For simplicity,

we only consider noninteracting closed-shell states and target states that are nondegenerate,

singlet ground-states; so, in that case, ρ1 denotes the spin-less one-particle density matrix.

Recently we have derived a generalization of the Kohn–Sham approach in which the

correlation energy Eco is assumed to be an explicit functional of v and ρ1, where v is the

external potential from the interacting target-state, and ρ1 is one-particle density matrix

from the noninteracting states [21, 22, 23, 24]. In a similar Brueckner-orbital method, called

reference-state one-particle density matrix theory [25, 26, 27], Eco is also assumed to be

an explicit functional of v and ρ1. In both of these approach, errors from Coulomb self-

interactions do not occur, nor the need to introduce functionals deﬁned by a constraint

search. By utilizing the method presented here, these explicit correlation-energy functionals

can be obtained [28].

II. THE NONINTERACTING STATE

A determinantal state is a wave function that is an eigenfunction of a noninteracting
Hamiltonian, say ˆHN vs, where ˆHN vs has no electron-electron interaction terms. These non-
interacting Hamiltonian ˆHN vs are completely speciﬁed by the number of electrons N and
the kernel of an external operator, say ˆvs. Explicitly we have

where

ˆHvs =

ˆFvs(ri),

N

i=1
X

ˆFvs = − 1

2 ∇2 + ˆvs,

and the nonlocal operator ˆvs—which we require to be a spin-free operator—is deﬁned by its

kernel vs, i.e., we have

(1)

(2)

(3)

ˆvsχ(r1) =

dr2 vs(r1, r2)χ(r2).

Using second quantization, our noninteracting Hamiltonian, given by Eq. (1), becomes

where the spin-adapted excitation operator is given by

ˆHvs =

(i| ˆFvs|j) ˆEij,

ij

ˆEij =

and the one-electrons integrals are spin-free and are written in chemist’s notation [10]; these

integrals use a spatial orbital say, say {χ}; this set has the following form:

where the spatial and spin coordinates, r and ω, can be denoted collectively by x, e.g.,

ψiσ(r, ω) = χi(r)σ(ω); σ = α, β,

ψiσ(x) = ψiσ(r, ω).

It is well known that there is a one-to-one mapping between determinantal states and

their one-particle density matrices [2, 29], say γ. For a closed-shell state we have

γ(x1, x2) =

χx(r1)σ(ω1) χ∗

x(r2)σ∗(ω2) =

χx(r1)χ∗

x(r2)δω1ω2,

(8)

and the spin-less one-particle density-matrix is

ρ1(r1, r2) =

γ(r1, ω, r2, ω) = 2

χx(r1)χ∗

x(r2),

(9)

X

Xx∈{χo}

where the sum is over the occupied orbitals from Eq. (6); this set of orbitals is denoted by

{χo}. Comparing Eqs. (8) and (9) yields

γ(x1, x2) =

ρ1(r1, r2)δω1ω2.

(10)

Since our closed-shell determinantal states are determined by ρ1, henceforth these kets are

denoted by |ρ1i.

Using Eq. (4) and the determinantal state |ρ1i, our eigenvalue problem can be written as

ˆHvs|ρ1i = 2

ǫw

|ρ1i = E0|ρ1i,

(11)

 

Xw∈{χo}

!

where a set of occupied orbitals {χo} is deﬁned by the lowest N eigenstates of ˆFvs,

ˆFvsχw = ǫwχw, χw ∈ {χo} −→ ρ1,

and the right side indicates that these orbitals, from the set {χo}, determine ρ1. The
unoccupied, or virtual, orbital set {χu} are also obtained from ˆFvs:

ˆFvsχr = ǫrχr, χr ∈ {χu} −→ ρ1,

where these orbitals also determine ρ1, since, for a complete set of orbitals, the unoccupied

set determine the occupied set; two set of orbitals that diﬀer by a unitary transformation

are considered equivalent.

While there is no restriction placed upon vs, normally it contains the external potential
v from an interacting state |ΨN vi, the Coulomb potential ˆJ, and an additional term, the

exchange-correlation potential ˆvxc, that we also permit to depend on the one-particle density

matrix:

ˆvs = v + ˆJρs + ˆvρ1

xc = v + ˆJρs + ˆKρ1 + ˆvρ1
co ,

and the latter expression deﬁnes the correlation potential ˆvρ1
Coulomb potential ˆJ , given by

co as ˆK + ˆvρ1

co ; furthermore, the

ˆJρs(r1) =

r−1
12 ρs(r2)dr2,

Z

Xw∈{χo}

and we use Eq. (9); the right side of this equation indicates that ρs is determined by ρ1.

The non-local operator ˆvxc can be identiﬁed as the exchange-correlation operator. If |ρ1i

is the Kohn-Sham noninteracting state, this operator is local and it implicitly depends only

on ρs, the density from |ρ1i and the interacting state |ΨN vi. For Brueckner orbital theory

[25, 30], this operator is nonlocal and may depend on the external potential v. For Hartree–

Fock theory, the correlation portion of ˆvxc is absent; so, in that case, ˆvρ1
operator, say ˆK, where the kernel of this operator is

xc is just the exchange

For latter use, we note that the Fock operator is given by

III. THE INTERACTING STATE

Now consider an interacting system of electrons. The electronic energy EN v for an eigen-

state of an interacting Hamiltonian is determined by the number of electrons N and the

one-body external potential v. This must be the case, since the non-relativistic, electronic

Hamiltonian is entirely speciﬁed by N and v:

by

EN v =

hΨN v|ΨN vi

,

are unique functionals of N and v.

can be expressed by

Using a second quantization approach, the Hamiltonian does not depend on N, and it

IV. MANY BODY PERTURBATION THEORY

Using many body perturbation theory [8, 9, 10, 20], we partition our Hamiltonian into

the zeroth order part, ˆHvs and a perturbation V :

ˆHv = ˆHvs + Vρ1,

(23)

where we choose ˆHvs from Eq. (4) as our zeroth-order Hamiltonian. Using Eqs. (2) and (21),
we have

Vρ1 =

(ij|kl) ˆEijkl +

(i|v|j) ˆEij −

(i|vs|j) ˆEij.

The energy through the ﬁrst order—the zeroth-order energy plus the 1st order—for many

body perturbation theory is independent of the zeroth-order Hamiltonian. This energy

functional, given by

E1[ρ1, v] = hρ1|Hv|ρ1i,

depends on the two functions: the external potential v and the one-particle density matrix

ρ1. Explicitly, this functional is given by

where the correlation potential is deﬁned by Eq. (14), i.e.,

and E0, E1, ˆJ, and ˆK are given by Eqs. (11), (26), (15), and (17), respectively; the brackets

{· · · }ρ1 indicate that the excitation operator is in normal ordered form with respect to the

vacuum state |ρ1i. In addition, subtracting Eq. (18) from (2) and using Eq. (31), we have

Eq. (29) is the most convenient expression for V1. However, we can also substitute Eq. (31)

into Eq. (29) yielding individual diagrams from the perturbation expansion that depend

(27)

(28)

(29)

(30)

(31)

(32)

(33)

explicitly on v and vs. Substituting Eq. (32) into Eq. (29) separates V1 into the zerorth-
order part ˆF and the Fock operator part ˆF , where { ˆF }ρ1 is the one-body portion of the

Hamiltonian [26]. While the individual terms from the perturbation expansion can depend
on vs or ˆF , as mentioned below, the correlation energy Eco, unless truncated, cannot depend
on vs or ˆF .

In many-body perturbation theory, the electronic energy is given by an order-by-order

expansion

E = E0 + E1 + E2 + E3 + · · · ,

where the energy through the ﬁrst order is

E1 = E0 + E1,

and the correlation energy Eco includes everything beyond the ﬁrst order:

Eco = E − E1 = E2 + E3 + · · · .

As mentioned previously, the electronic energy E is determined by v and N, while E1 is

an explicit functional of v and ρ1. Hence, the correlation energy, given by (Eco = E − E1), is

determined by v, ρ1, and N, or just v and ρ1, since ρ1 determines N. Therefore, at least for

the ground state, the correlation energy is an implicit functional of v and ρ1, i.e, Eco[v, ρ1].

We now demonstrate that the individual perturbation terms, or diagrams, can be written

as explicit functional of v, vs and ρ1.

Generally speaking, perturbation theory expresses Eco as a functional of the occupied and

unoccupied orbitals from |ρ1i, the orbitals energies {ǫ}, and the one-body portion or the
co , (v − vs + ˆJρs + ˆKρ1), or ( ˆF − ˆF)), as indicated
perturbation V1, which, in our case is −ˆvρ1
in Eqs. (29), (31), and (32). The correlation-energy diagrams, however, do not depend on

the constant portion of the perturbation Vc; the two-body part V2 is universal, since this

operator is the same for all electronic systems.

Consider for the second-order (correction to the) energy, given by

E2 = E2u + E2d + E2x,

(36)

where the Goldstone diagrams for these terms are given by the ﬁrst three entries of Fig. 1,

respectively. For the ﬁrst term, we have

One way to handle these terms is by using a basis set expansion for δ, as in Eq. (50),

The 2d subscript indicates that E2d correspond to a second order “direct” diagram. The

second-order exchange term E2x, from Eq. (36), is represented by the third diagram of Fig. 1.

This diagram can be evaluated in a similar way as the direct one E2d, giving

Note that the E2d and E2x do not explicitly depend on the external potential v.

In Fig. 1, the dummy indices that are used are denoted in the diagrams. For example,

the ﬁrst diagram has z1 for the ﬁrst vertex and r2 for the second index, where these choices

are indicated by 1 and 2 in the ﬁgure. In order to evaluate this diagram and obtain Eq. (48)

coρ1 ; the hole line from vertex 1 to 2 gives a factor of 1

directly, we start at the bottom vertex and go backwards: The bottom vertex gives a factor
of −˜vvsz1
−ˆvρ1

2 ρ1(r1, r2); the top vertex gives
2κρ1(r2, r1). Furthermore, there is an
additional factor of two for the loop, since the spin state is conserved on an orientated

co (r2); the particle line from vertex 2 to 1 gives 1

path [9]. Similarly, the second two diagrams from the ﬁgure can be evaluated to give

Eqs. (58) and (60), where in both diagrams, the lower interactions, with dummy indices r1,
r2 and t12, yield the operator (˜rˆvs
12)−1. For the second diagam in the ﬁgure, the direct one
E2d, we have the following factors: a 1
2, since the diagram is symmetric, a factor of 2 × 2 for
the two loops, and a factor of 1
2 for the two ρ1 terms and two κ terms. Putting
2 = 1
2 × 2 × 2 × 1
Now consider the fourth diagram in Fig. 1, where for convenience we denote this third

Comparing the right side of this expression with the the fourth diagram in the ﬁgure, or with

Eq. (61), we see that the two lowest interactions, with the following two matrix elements:

(rw|sx) and (wy|xz), are directly related to the energy exponential factors: (ǫw −ǫr +ǫx −ǫs)

and (ǫy − ǫw + ǫz − ǫx). Therefore, multiplying Eq. (63) by these two matrix elements gives

one—the integration limit is from 0 to ∞. ii) For other interactions, the integration limit is
from ti to ∞, if the interaction above it is ˜vvszi
if the interaction above it is (˜rˆvs

and sign factors as well as a factor of two for each loop corresponding to a sum over each

spin state, α and β [9].

arbitrary (arb) fourth order diagram by Earb. Using the rules above we get

Hence, using the above rules for all diagram, and Eqs. (31) and (51)—for ˆvρ1

co and κρ1—
yields the correlation energy Eco as an explicit functional ρ1, v, and vs. i.e, Eco[ρ1, v, vs]. The
other two choices are Eco as an explicit functional ρ1, v, and ˆvρ1
co , or, using Eq. (32), Eco as
an explicit functional ρ1, v, and ˆFρ1. i.e, Eco[ρ1, v, ˆFρ1], where the v dependence arises from
the Fock operator ˆFρ1, using Eq. (18).

It is well known the the correlation energy cannot depend on the zeroth order Hamiltonian
ˆFρ1. Therefore, while the expansion Eco[ρ1, v, ˆFρ1] has individual diagrams that explicitly
depend of ˆFρ1, the entire series does not. Certain inﬁnite-order partial summations also yield

results that are independent of a zeroth order Hamiltonian. For example, if all diagrams

are included that correspond to a coupled cluster calculation, the ﬁnal approximation of Eco
does not depend on the zeroth order Hamiltonian ˆFρ1, that is, we have the following implicit

functional: Eco[ρ1, v].

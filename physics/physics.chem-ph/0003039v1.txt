Abstract

A benchmark study has been carried out on the ground-state potential curve

of the hydroxyl anion, OH−, including detailed calibration of both the 1-

particle and n-particle basis sets. The CCSD(T) basis set limit overestimates

ωe by about 10 cm−1, which is only remedied by inclusion of connected quadru-

ple excitations in the coupled cluster expansion — or, equivalently, the inclu-

sion of the 2π orbitals in the active space of a multireference calculation.

Upon inclusion of scalar relativistic eﬀects (-3 cm−1 on ωe), a potential curve

of spectroscopic quality (sub-cm−1 accuracy) is obtained. Our best computed

EA(OH), 1.828 eV, agrees to three decimal places with the best available ex-

perimental value. Our best computed dissociation energies, D0(OH−)=4.7796

eV and D0(OH)=4.4124 eV, suggest that the experimental D0(OH)=4.392 eV

may possibly be about 0.02 eV too low.

I. INTRODUCTION

Molecular anions play an important role in the chemistry of the interstellar medium [1],

of carbon stars [2], and the Earth’s ionosphere [3]. As pointed out in Ref. [4], the presence of

1

anions in the interstellar medium may have profound consequences for our understanding of

the interstellar processing of the biogenic elements (see e.g. Ref. [5] and references therein).

Yet as judged from the number of entries in the compilations of Huber and Herzberg [6]

(for diatomics) and of Jacox [7] (for polyatomics), high- or even medium-resolution spec-

troscopic data for anions are relatively scarce compared to the amount of data available for

neutral or even cationic species:

in the 1992 review of Hirota [8] on spectroscopy of ions,

only 13 molecular anions were listed in Table VII, compared to 4 1/2 pages worth of entries

for cations. (Early reviews of anion spectroscopy are found in Refs. [9,10], while ab initio

studies of structure and spectroscopy of anions were reviewed fairly recently by Botschwina

and coworkers [11].) Some of the reasons for this paucity are discussed in the introductions

to Refs. [12,4].

One such species is the hydroxyl anion, OH−. By means of velocity modulation spec-

troscopy [13], high-resolution fundamentals were obtained [14,15] for three isotopomers,

namely 16OH−, 16OD−, and 18OH−; in addition, some pure rotational transitions have been

observed [16]. Lineberger and coworkers [17] earlier obtained some rotational data in the

course of an electron photodetachment study, and obtained precise electron aﬃnities (EAs)

of 14741.03(17) and 14723.92(30) cm−1, respectively, for OH and OD. Very recently, the

same group re-measured [18] EA(OH) and obtained essentially the same value but with a

higher precision, 14741.02(3) cm−1.

The spectroscopic constants of OH− were previously the subject of ab initio studies,

notably by Werner et al. [19] using multireference conﬁguration interaction (MRCI) methods,

and recently by Lee and Dateo (LD) [12] using coupled cluster theory with basis sets as large

as [7s6p5d4f 3g2h/6s5p4d3f 2g].

The LD paper is particularly relevant here. The CCSD(T) (coupled cluster with all

single and double substitutions [20] and a quasiperturbative treatment for triple excitations

[21]) method, in combination with basis sets of at least spdf g quality and including an

account for inner-shell correlation, can routinely predict vibrational band origins of small

polyatomic molecules with a mean absolute error on the order of a few cm−1 (e.g.

for

2

C2H2 [22], SO2 [23]). Yet while LD found very good agreement between their computed

CCSD(T)/[6s5p4d3f2g/5s4p3d2f] spectroscopic constants and available experimental data,

consideration of further basis set expansion and of inner-shell correlation eﬀects leads to a

predicted fundamental ν at the CCSD(T) basis set limit of 3566.2±1 cm−1, about 11 cm−1

higher than the experimental results [14] of 3555.6057(22) cm−1, where the uncertainty in

parentheses represents two standard deviations.

In a recent benchmark study [24] on the ground-state potential curves of the ﬁrst-row

diatomic hydrides using both CCSD(T) and FCI (full conﬁguration interaction) methods, the

author found that CCSD(T) has a systematic tendency to overestimate harmonic frequencies

of A–H stretching frequencies by on the order of 6 cm−1. Even so, the discrepancy seen by

LD is a bit out of the ordinary, and the question arises as to what level of theory is required

to obtain ‘the right result for the right reason’ in this case.

In the present work, we shall show that the discrepancy between the CCSD(T) basis

set limit and Nature is mostly due to two factors: (a) neglect of the eﬀect of connected

quadruple excitations, and (b) neglect of scalar relativistic eﬀects. When these are properly

accounted for, the available vibrational transitions can be reproduced to within a fraction of

a cm−1 from the computed potential curve. In the context of the present Special Issue, this

will also serve as an illustrative example of the type of accuracy that can be achieved for

small systems with the present state of the art. Predicted band origins for higher vibrational

levels (and ‘hot bands’) may assist future experimental work on this system. Finally, as

by-products of our analysis, we will show that the electron aﬃnity of OH can be reproduced

to very high accuracy, and tentatively propose a slight upward revision of the dissociation

energy of neutral hydroxyl radical, OH.

II. COMPUTATIONAL METHODS

The coupled cluster, multireference averaged coupled pair functional (ACPF) [25], and

full CI calculations were carried out using MOLPRO 98.1 [26] running on DEC/Compaq Al-

pha workstations in our laboratory, and on the SGI Origin 2000 of the Faculty of Chemistry.

3

Full CCSDT (coupled cluster theory with all connected single, double and triple excitations

[27]) and CCSD(TQ) (CCSD with quasiperturbative corrections for triple and quadruple ex-

citations [28]) calculations were carried out using ACES II [29] on a DEC Alpha workstation.

Correlation consistent basis sets due to Dunning and coworkers [30,31] were used through-

out. Since the system under consideration is anionic, the regular cc-pVnZ (correlation consis-

tent polarized valence n-tuple zeta, or VnZ for short) basis sets will be inadequate. We have

considered both the aug-cc-pVnZ (augmented correlation consistent, or AVnZ for short) basis

sets [32] in which one low-exponent function of each angular momentum is added to both the

oxygen and hydrogen basis sets, as well as the aug′-cc-pVnZ basis sets [33] in which the ad-

dition is not made to the hydrogen basis set. In addition we consider both uncontracted ver-

sions of the same basis sets (denoted by the suﬃx ”uc”) and the aug-cc-pCVnZ basis sets [34]

(ACVnZ) which include added core-valence correlation functions. The largest basis sets con-

sidered in this work, aug-cc-pV6Z and aug-cc-pCV5Z, are of [8s7p6d5f4g3h2i/7s6p5d4f3g2h]

and [11s10p8d6f4g2h/6s5p4d3f2g] quality, respectively.

The multireference ACPF calculations were carried out from a CASSCF (complete ac-

tive space SCF) reference wave function with an active space consisting of the valence

(2σ)(3σ)(1π)(4σ) orbitals as well as the (2π) Rydberg orbitals: this is denoted CAS(8/7)-

ACPF (i,e, 8 electrons in 7 orbitals). While the inclusion of the (2π) orbitals is essential (see

below), the inclusion of the (5σ) Rydberg orbital (i.e., CAS(8/8)-ACPF) was considered and

found to aﬀect computed properties negligibly. In addition, some exploratory CAS-AQCC

(averaged quadratic coupled cluster [35]) calculations were also carried out.

Scalar relativistic eﬀects were computed as expectation values of the one-electron Darwin

and mass-velocity operators [36,37] for the ACPF wave functions.

The energy was evaluated at 21 points around re, with a spacing of 0.01 ˚A. (All energies

were converged to 10−12 hartree, or wherever possible to 10−13 hartree.) A polynomial

in (r − re)/re of degree 8 or 9 (the latter if an F-test revealed an acceptable statistical

signiﬁcance for the nonic term) was ﬁtted to the energies. Using the procedure detailed in

Ref. [24], the Dunham series [38] thus obtained was transformed by derivative matching into

4

a variable-beta Morse (VBM) potential [39]

Vc = De (cid:16)1 − exp[−z(1 + b1z + b2z2 + . . . + b6z6)](cid:17)2

(1)

in which z ≡ β(r − re)/re, De is the (computed or observed) dissociation energy, and β is

an adjustable parameter related to that in the Morse function. Analysis of this function

was then carried out in two diﬀerent manners: (a) analytic diﬀerentiation with respect to

(r − re)/re up to the 12th derivative followed by a 12th-order Dunham analysis using an

adaptation of the ACET program of Ogilvie [40]; and (b) numerical integration of the one-

dimensional Schr¨odinger equation using the algorithm of Balint-Kurti et al. [41], on a grid of

512 points over the interval 0.5a0—5a0. As expected, diﬀerences between vibrational energies

obtained using both methods are negligible up to the seventh vibrational quantum, and still

no larger than 0.4 cm−1 for the tenth vibrational quantum.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

A. n-particle calibration

The largest basis set in which we were able to obtain a full CI potential curve was cc-

pVDZ+sp(O), which means the standard cc-pVDZ basis set with the diﬀuse s and p function

from aug-cc-pVDZ added to oxygen. A comparison of computed properties for OH− with

diﬀerent electron correlation methods is given in Table I, while their errors in the total energy

relative to full CI are plotted in Figure 1.

It is immediately seen that CCSD(T) exaggerates the curvature of the potential surface,

overestimating ωe by 10 cm−1.

In addition, it underestimates the bond length by about

0.0006 ˚A. These are slightly more pronounced variations on trends previously seen [24] for

the OH radical.

The problem does not reside in CCSD(T)’s quasiperturbative treatment of triple excita-

tions: performing a full CCSDT calculation instead lowers ωe by only 1.7 cm−1 and lengthens

the bond by less than 0.0001 ˚A. Quasiperturbative inclusion of connected quadruple excita-

tions, however, using the CCSD(TQ) method, lowers ωe by 8.5 cm−1 relative to CCSD(T),

5

and slightly lengthens the bond, by 0.00025 ˚A. (Essentially the same result was obtained by

means of the CCSD+TQ* method [42], which diﬀers from CCSD(TQ) in a small sixth-order

term E6T T .) No CCSDT(Q) code was available to the author: approximating the CCSDT(Q)

energy by the expression E[CCSDT (Q)] ≈ E[CCSDT ]+E[CCSD(T Q)]−E[CC5SD(T )] =

E[CCSDT ] + E5QQ + E5QT , we obtain a potential curve in fairly good agreement with full

CI.

What is the source of the importance of connected quadruple excitations in this case?

Analysis of the FCI wave function reveals prominent contributions to the wave function

from (1π)4(2π)0 → (1π)2(2π)2 double excitations; while the (2π) orbitals are LUMO+2

and LUMO+3 rather than LUMO, a large portion of them sits in the same spatial region

as the occupied (1π) orbitals. In any proper multireference treatment, the aforementioned

excitations would be in the zero-order wave function: obviously, the space of all double

excitations therefrom would also entail quadruple excitations with respect to the Hartree-

Fock reference, including a connected component.

Since the basis set sizes for which we can hope to perform CCSDT(Q) or similar calcu-

lations on this system are quite limited, we considered multireference methods, speciﬁcally

ACPF from a [(2σ)(3σ)(4σ)(1π)(2π)]8 reference space (denoted ACPF(8/7) further on). As

might be expected, the computed properties are in very close agreement with FCI, except

for ωe being 1.5 cm−1 too high. AQCC(8/7) does not appear to represent a further improve-

ment, and adding the (5σ) orbital to the ACPF reference space (i.e. ACPF(8/8)) aﬀects

properties only marginally.

B. 1-particle basis set calibration

All relevant results are collected in Table II. Basis set convergence in this system was

previously studied in some detail by LD at the CCSD(T) level. Among other things, they

noted that ωe still changes by 4 cm−1 upon expanding the basis set from aug-cc-pVQZ to aug-

cc-pV5Z. They suggested that ωe then should be converged to about 1 cm−1; this statement

6

is corroborated by the CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pV6Z results.

Since the negative charge resides almost exclusively on the oxygen, the temptation exists

to use aug′-cc-pVnZ basis sets, i.e. to apply aug-cc-pVnZ only to the oxygen atom but use

a regular cc-pVnZ basis set on hydrogen. For n=T, this results in fact in a diﬀerence of 10

cm−1 on ωe, but the gap narrows as n increases. Yet extrapolation suggests convergence of

the computed fundamental to a value about 1 cm−1 higher than the aug-cc-pVnZ curve.

For the AVnZ and A’VnZ basis sets (n=T,Q), the CAS(8/7)-ACPF approach systemat-

ically lowers harmonic frequencies by about 8 cm−1 compared to CCSD(T); for the funda-

mental the diﬀerence is even slightly larger (9.5 cm−1). Interestingly, this diﬀerence decreases

for n=5.

It was noted previously [24] that the higher anharmonicity constants exhibit rather

greater basis set dependence than one might reasonably have expected, and that this sensi-

tivity is greatly reduced if uncontracted basis sets are employed (which have greater radial

ﬂexibility). The same phenomenon is seen here.

In agreement with previous observations by LD, inner-shell correlation reduces the bond

lengthen slightly, and increases ωe by 5–6 cm−1. This occurs both at the CCSD(T) and the

CAS(8/7)-ACPF levels.

C. Additional corrections and best estimate

At our highest level of theory so far, namely CAS(8/7)-ACPF(all)/ACV5Z, ν is pre-

dicted to be 3559.3 cm−1, still several cm−1 higher than experiment. The eﬀects of fur-

ther basis set improvement can be gauged from the diﬀerence between CCSD(T)/AV6Z and

CCSD(T)/AV5Z results: one notices an increase of +1.0 cm−1 in ωe and a decrease of 0.00006

˚A in re. We also performed some calculations with a doubly augmented cc-pV5Z basis set

(i.e. d-AV5Z), and found the results to be essentially indistinguishable from those with the

singly augmented basis set. Residual imperfections in the electron correlation method can be

gauged from the CAS(8/7)-ACPF − FCI diﬀerence with our smallest basis set, and appear

to consist principally of a contraction of re by 0.00004 ˚A and a decrease in ωe by 1.5 cm−1.

7

Adding the two sets of diﬀerences to obtain a ‘best nonrelativistic’ set of spectroscopic con-

stants, we obtain ν=3558.6 cm−1, still 3 cm−1 above experiment. In both cases, changes in

the anharmonicity constants from the best directly computed results are essentially nil.

Scalar relativistic corrections were computed at the CAS(8/7)-ACPF level with and

without the (1s)-like electrons correlated, and with a variety of basis sets. All re-

sults are fairly consistent with those obtained at the highest level considered, CAS(8/7)-

ACPF(all)/ACVQZ, namely an expansion of re by about 0.0001 ˚A and — most importantly

for our purposes — a decrease of ωe by about 3 cm−1. Eﬀects on the anharmonicity constants

are essentially nonexistent.

Upon adding these corrections to our best nonrelativistic spectroscopic constants, we

obtain our ﬁnal best estimates. These lead to ν=3555.44 cm−1 for 16OH−, in excellent

agreement with the experimental result [14] 3555.6057(22) cm−1. The discrepancy between

computed (3544.30 cm−1) and observed [14] (3544.4551(28) cm−1) values for 18OH− is quite

similar. For 16OD−, we obtain ν=2625.31 cm−1, which agrees to better than 0.1 cm−1 with

the experimental value [15] 2625.332(3) cm−1. Our computed bond length is slightly shorter

than the observed one [14] for OH−, but within the error bar of that for OD− [15].

If

we assume an inverse mass dependence for the experimental diabatic bond distance and

extrapolate to inﬁnite mass, we obtain an experimentally derived Born-Oppenheimer bond

distance of 0.96416(16) cm−1, in perfect agreement with our calculations.

While until recently it was generally assumed that scalar relativistic corrections are not

important for ﬁrst-and second-row systems, it has now been shown repeatedly (e.g. [43–45])

that for kJ/mol accuracy on computed bonding energies, scalar relativistic corrections are

indispensable. Very recently, Csaszar et al. [46] considered the eﬀect of scalar relativistic

corrections on the ab initio water surface, and found corrections on the same order of mag-

nitude as seen for the hydroxyl anion here. Finally, Bauschlicher [47] compared ﬁrst-order

Darwin and mass-velocity corrections to energetics (for single-reference ACPF wave func-

tions) with more rigorous relativistic methods (speciﬁcally, Douglas-Kroll [48]), and found

that for ﬁrst-and second-row systems, the two approaches yield essentially identical results,

8

lending additional credence to the results of both Csaszar et al. and from the present work.

(The same author found [49] more signiﬁcant deviations for third-row main group systems.)

Is the relativistic eﬀect seen here in OH− unique to it, or does it occur in the neutral ﬁrst-

row diatomic hydrides as well? Some results obtained for BH, CH, NH, OH, and HF in their

respective ground states, and using the same method as for OH−, are collected in Table III.

In general, ωe is slightly lowered, and re very slightly stretched — these tendencies becoming

more pronounced as one moves from left to right in the Periodic Table. The eﬀect for OH−

appears to be stronger than for the isoelectronic neutral hydride HF, and deﬁnitely compared

to neutral OH. The excellent agreement (±1 cm−1 on vibrational quanta) previously seen

[24] for the ﬁrst-row diatomic hydrides between experiment and CCSD(T)/ACV5Z potential

curves with an FCI correction is at least in part due to a cancellation between the eﬀects of

further basis set extension on the one hand, and scalar relativistic eﬀects (neglected in Ref.

[24]) on the other hand. The shape of the relativistic contribution to the potential curve is

easily understood qualitatively: on average, electrons are somewhat further away from the

nucleus in a molecule than in the separated atoms (hence the scalar relativistic contribution

to the total energy will be slightly smaller in absolute value at re than in the dissociation

limit): as one approaches the united atom limit, however, the contribution will obviously

increase again. The ﬁnal result is a slight reduction in both the dissociation energy and on

ωe.

In order to assist future experimental studies on OH− and its isomers, predicted vibra-

tional quanta G(n) −G(n −1) are given in Table V for various isotopic species, together with

some key spectroscopic constants. The VBM parameters of the potential are given in Table

IV. The VBM expansion generally converges quite rapidly [39] and, as found previously for

OH, parameters b5 and b6 are found to be statistically not signiﬁcant and were omitted.

The VBM expansion requires the insertion of a dissociation energy: we have opted, rather

than an experimental value, to use our best calculated value (see next paragraph).

Agreement between computed and observed fundamental frequencies speaks for itself, as

does that between computed and observed rotational constants. At ﬁrst sight agreement

9

for the rotation-vibration coupling constants αe is somewhat disappointing. However, for

16OH− and 18OH−, the experimentally derived ‘αe’ actually corresponds to B1 − B0, i.e. to

αe − 2γe + . . .. If we compare the observed B1 − B0 with the computed αe − 2γe instead,

excellent agreement is found. In the case of 16OD−, the experimentally derived αe given is

actually extrapolated from neutral 16OD: again, agreement between computed and observed

B1 − B0 is rather more satisfying.

We also note that our calculations validate the conclusion by Lee and Dateo that the

experimentally derived ωe and ωexe for 16OH should be revised upward.

D. Dissociation energies of OH and OH−; electron aﬃnity of OH

This was obtained in the following manner, which is a variant on W2 theory [44]: (a) the

CASSCF(8/7) dissociation energy using ACVTZ, ACVQZ, and ACV5Z basis sets was ex-

trapolated geometrically using the geometric formula A + B/C n ﬁrst proposed by Feller [50];

(b) the dynamical correlation component (deﬁned at CAS(8/7)-ACPF(all) − CASSCF(8/7))

of the dissociation energy was extrapolated to inﬁnite maximum angular momentum in the

basis set, l → ∞ from the ACVQZ (l=4) and ACV5Z (l=5) results using the formula

[51] A + B/l3; (c) the scalar relativistic contribution obtained at the CAS(8/7)-ACPF level

was added to the total, as was the spin-orbit splitting [52] for O−(2P ). Our ﬁnal result,

D0=4.7796 eV, is about 0.02 eV higher than the experimental one [6]; interestingly enough,

the same is true for the OH radical (computed D0=4.4124 eV, observed 4.392 eV). In com-

bination with either the experimental electron aﬃnity of oxygen atom, EA(O)=1.461122(3)

eV [53] or the best computed EA(O)=1.46075 eV [54], this leads to electron aﬃnities of

OH, EA(OH)=1.8283 eV and 1.8280 eV, respectively, which agree to three decimal places

with the experimental value [18] 1.827611(4) eV. We note that the experimental De(OH−)

is derived from De(OH)+EA(OH)−EA(O), and that a previous calibration study on the

atomization energies of the ﬁrst-row hydrides [55] suggested that the experimental De(OH)

may be too low. While a systematic error in the electronic structure treatment that cancels

almost exactly between OH and OH− cannot entirely be ruled out, the excellent agreement

10

obtained for the electron aﬃnity does lend support to the computed De values.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

We have been able to obtain a fully ab initio radial function of spectroscopic quality for the

hydroxyl anion. In order to obtain accurate results for this system, inclusion of connected

quadruple excitations (in a coupled cluster expansion) is imperative, as is an account for

scalar relativistic eﬀects. Basis set expansion eﬀects beyond spdf gh take a distant third

place in importance. While consideration of connected quadruple excitation eﬀects and of

basis set expansion eﬀects beyond spdf gh would at present be prohibitively expensive for

studies of larger anions, no such impediment would appear to exist for inclusion of the scalar

relativistic eﬀects (at least for one-electron Darwin and mass-velocity terms).

Our best computed EA(OH), 1.828 eV, agrees to three decimal places with the best

available experimental value. Our best computed dissociation energies, D0(OH−)=4.7796

eV and D0(OH)=4.4124 eV, suggest that the experimental D0(OH)=4.392 eV (from which

the experimental D0(OH−) was derived by a thermodynamic cycle) may possibly be about

0.02 eV too low.

One of the purposes of the paper by Lee and Dateo [12] was to point out to the scientiﬁc

community, and in particular the experimental community, that state-of-the art ab initio

methods now have the capability to predict the spectroscopic constants of molecular anions

with suﬃcient reliability to permit assignment of a congested spectrum from an uncontrolled

environment — such as an astronomical observation — on the basis of the theoretical calcu-

lations alone. The present work would appear to support this assertion beyond any doubt.

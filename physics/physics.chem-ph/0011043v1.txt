Abstract

It is predicted that nuclear spin conversion in molecules can be eﬃciently con-

trolled by strong laser radiation resonant to rovibrational molecular transition.

The phenomenon can be used for substantial enrichment of spin isomers, or

for detection of very weak (10 − 100 Hz) interactions in molecules.

I. INTRODUCTION

Many symmetrical molecules exist in Nature only in the form of nuclear spin isomers

[1]. These isomers diﬀer by symmetry of nuclear spin wave function and, consequently, by

symmetry of molecular spatial wave function. Relaxation between diﬀerent spin states (spin

conversion) is extremely slow process if it is compared with other gas kinetic rates, e.g.,

vibrational relaxation. It makes nuclear spin isomers unique objects with many potential

applications.

It was shown in a recent paper [2] that external radiation can inﬂuence conversion of spin

isomers both through level populations and through optically induced coherences. Purpose of

the paper [2] was to investigate main features of the coherent control of isomer enrichment

and conversion.

In order to achieve the goal, the process was considered in a simplest

arrangement in which microwave radiation excited molecular rotational transition.

In the present paper we will consider the process in more complicated arrangement which

promises signiﬁcantly better control of spin conversion. One outcome of this high eﬃciency

is that the coherent control in new arrangement can be used for detection of very weak

(10 − 100 Hz) interactions in molecules.

II. EQUATION OF CHANGE

First, we give qualitative picture of the process. Let us assume that a test molecule

has two nuclear spin states, ortho and para, and that there is a laser radiation resonant to

the rovibrational transition, m − n, in the ortho subspace, Fig. 1. The low state n is not

mixed with para states, but the upper state m is mixed by the intramolecular perturbation
In addition, there is the ortho-para level pair, m′ − k′, in the
ˆV with the para state k.
ground vibrational state mixed by another intramolecular perturbation ˆV ′. We assume that

collisions of the test molecules cannot alter their spin state. This arrangement corresponds

to the general formulation of quantum relaxation in which one has collisionally isolated

subspaces of states mixed together by internal perturbation [3]. Suppose that the molecule

is placed initially in the ortho subspace of the ground vibrational state. Due to collisions

the test molecule will undergo fast rotational relaxation inside the ortho subspace. This
will proceed until molecule jumps to the state m′, which is directly mixed with the para

2

state k′, or to the state n which is mixed by combined action of the external ﬁeld and
intramolecular perturbation ˆV with the para state k. Admixture of a para state implies

that the next collision can move the molecule to another para states and thus localize it

inside the para subspace. It is clear that resonant radiation can signiﬁcantly modify the spin

conversion. One knows from the literature on resonant interaction of strong laser radiation

with matter (see, e.g., [4,5]) that radiation can change population of states, split states and

create coherences in the system. All these can aﬀect the mixing of ortho and para states

and thus the spin conversion process.

Quantitative description of the problem can be performed with the help of kinetic equa-

tion for density matrix, ˆρ. The molecular Hamiltonian consists of four terms,

The main part, ˆH0, has the eigen ortho and para states shown in Fig. 1. ¯h ˆG describes the

molecular interactions with the external radiation,

ˆH = ˆH0 + ¯h ˆG + ¯h ˆV + ¯h ˆV ′.

ˆG = −(E0 ˆd/¯h) cos ωLt,

where E0 and ωL are the amplitude and frequency of the electromagnetic wave; ˆd is the

operator of the molecular electric dipole moment. We have neglected molecular motion in
the operator ˆG in order to simplify the theory.

In the representation of the eigen states of ˆH0 kinetic equation reads,

dˆρ/dt = (dˆρ/dt)coll − i[ ˆG + ˆV + ˆV ′, ˆρ],

where (dˆρ/dt)coll is the collision integral. Further, collisions in our system will be described

by the model standard in the theory of molecular interaction with laser radiation. The

oﬀ-diagonal elements of (dˆρ/dt)coll will be assumed to have only decay terms,

(dρj,j′/dt)coll = −Γρjj′;

j 6= j′.

Here, j and j′ indicate rovibrational states of the molecule. These states are assumed to

have no degeneracy. The decoherence rates were taken equal for all oﬀ-diagonal elements of

collision integral. Diagonal terms of the collision integral will be described in the framework

of the strong collision model.

Our goal is to determine time dependence of the total concentration of molecules in one

spin state. For example, for the total concentration of ortho molecules, ρo, one can get from

Eq. (3) the following equation of change,

dρo/dt = 2Re i(ρmkVkm + ρm′k′V ′

k′m′).

In fact, this result is valid for any model of collision integral, as long as collisions do not

alter the molecular spin state which implies,

j(dρjj/dt)coll = 0, if j ∈ ortho, or j ∈ para.

P
One has to make a few simpliﬁcations in order to ﬁnd the oﬀ-diagonal density matrix
elements, ρmk and ρm′k′. We assume ˆV and ˆV ′ being small and consider zero and ﬁrst order

terms of the density matrix,

ˆρ = ˆρ(0) + ˆρ(1).

We start with zero order perturbation theory. ρ(0) is determined by the kinetic equation,

dˆρ(0)/dt = (dˆρ(0)/dt)coll − i[ ˆG, ˆρ(0)].

In zero order perturbation theory, para molecules are at equilibrium,

p (g, j) = (n − ρ(0)
ρ(0)

o )w(j);

ρ(0)
p (e, j) = 0,

where n is the total concentration of the test molecules; w(j) is the Boltzmann distribution

over rotational states. We will assume the same function w(j) for each of four vibrational

states. We have neglected in Eq. (8) vibrational resonance exchange between ortho and

para molecules which would populate the upper vibrational state of para molecules. It was

taken into account also that ortho-para exchange is on many orders of magnitude slower

than vibrational and rotational relaxations.

Equations for stationary level populations of ortho molecules are obtained from Eqs. (4)

and (7). Thus one has,

(νV + νR)ρ(0)

o (e, j) = νRw(j)ρ(0)

o (e) + ρ(0)

rates for diﬀerent degrees of freedom makes the model of strong collisions more accurate.
Eqs. (9) correspond to rotational wave approximation. Matrix element of ˆG is given by

Gmn = −Ge−iΩt; G ≡ E0dmn/2¯h,

(10)

where Ω = ωL − ωmn is the radiation frequency detuning from the absorption line center,

ωmn; the line over symbol indicate a time-independent factor. Rabi frequency, G, is assumed

to be real.

Solution of Eqs. (9) has no diﬃculty. Concentration of ortho molecules in excited vibra-

tional state, ρ(0)(e), and in the state m which one needs for further calculations read,

In zero order perturbation theory, one neglects perturbations ˆV and ˆV ′. It implies that

there are no coherences between ortho and para states, ρ(0)

mk = 0; ρ(0)

m′k′ = 0. Consequently,

one has,

dρo/dt = 2Re i(ρ(1)

instead of Eq. (5). Note, that the spin conversion appears in the second order approximation.

The ﬁrst order correction to the density matrix, ρ(1), is determined by the equation,

New parameters, ω1 and ω2, can be interpreted as the gaps between the two components,

|m1 > and |m2 >, of the ortho state |m >, split by the optical ﬁeld, and the para state |k >.

The ortho state, |m2 >, crosses the para state, |k >, at Ω = −ω(1 − G2/ω2), see Fig. 2.

The splitting of states by resonant laser radiation is well-known phenomenon in nonlinear

spectroscopy [4,5].

Using Eq. (17) one can present equation of change in the ﬁnal form,

dρo/dt = nγ′

op − ρoγ;

γ ≡ γ′

(19)

In writing this equation we have neglected in the right-hand side of Eq. (17) small diﬀerence

between ρ(0)

and the total concentration of ortho molecules, ρo. In Eq. (19) the following

partial conversion rates have been introduced. The ﬁeld independent rates,

appears because of depletion of the ground vibrational state of ortho molecules by optical
excitation, Index n in γ′

n comes from “noncoherent”, i.e., induced by level populations.

Another term of similar “noncoherent” origin appears due to the level population, ρ(0)

o (m),

in Eq. (17),

And ﬁnally the “coherent” term, γcoh, originated from ρ(0)

Solution to Eq. (19) can be presented as,

ρo = ρo + (ρo(0) − ρo) exp(−γt);

ρo = nγ′

op/γ.

Here γ is the equilibration rate in the system in the presence of external ﬁeld; ρo is the

stationary concentration of ortho molecules. Without an external radiation (at the instant

t = 0), the equilibrium concentration of para molecules is equal to,

if the Boltzmann factors are assumed to be equal, w(k′) = w(m′). This implies γ′

(see Eq. (20)), the laser ﬁeld produces a stationary enrichment of para molecules,

One can see from this equation that external ﬁeld changes concentration of para isomers if

γ 6= γf ree.

We assume in further analysis the following parameters, ω = 100 MHz, ω′ = 130 MHz,
m′k′ = 5 kHz, Γ = 2 · 108 s−1/Torr and the Boltzmann factors of the states m′, k′, m,
V ′
and k all equal 10−2. This set of parameters gives the ﬁeld free conversion rate, γf ree =
10−2 s−1/Torr, which coincides with the conversion rate in 13CH3F. Nuclear spin conversion

in these molecules is governed by quantum relaxation (see the review [6]). The rotational

and vibrational relaxation rates will be taken equal, νR = 0.1Γ and νV = 0.01Γ, respectively.

First, we consider relatively low optical ﬁelds, thus small G. In this case one has two

peaks in enrichment at frequencies Ω ≃ −ω and Ω = 0, see Fig. 3. The data shown in this

7

ﬁgure correspond to Vmk = 3 kHz, and Γ = 2 MHz. The peak at Ω = 0 appears because

the excitation probability, p, has maximum at this frequency. Amplitude of this peak is

determined mainly by the rate γn. As G grows, the amplitude of the peak 2 reaches the
value γn/γf ree ∼ (V ω′/2V ′ω)2 which constitutes ≃ 15%. The peak at Ω = 0 in isomer

enrichment was predicted in [7] by considering only the level population eﬀects.

Peak at Ω ≃ −ω appears because the ortho state |m2 > crosses the para state |k > at

this frequency of the external ﬁeld (see Fig. 2). This peak is determined mainly by γcoh.

When G increases its amplitude grows to much bigger values than the amplitude of the peak

at Ω = 0. At resonant frequency Ω ≃ −ω the rate γcoh is enhanced by large factor (ω/Γ)2.

This explains much larger enrichment at Ω ≃ −ω. Note, that large enrichment occurs only

if the excitation probability at this frequency, p(−ω), is not very low.

The data shown in Fig. 4 correspond to strong optical ﬁeld, G = 50 MHz, and three

values of Vmk. Γ was taken equal 2 MHz. One can see, that strong optical ﬁeld is able

to convert almost all molecules to the para state if Vmk ≃ Vm′k′. Thus relatively weak

(3 kHz) coupling in upper state is able to produce macroscopic eﬀect, viz., almost complete

enrichment of spin isomers. It is of fundamental importance, that even for much weaker

coupling in upper state, enrichment is still signiﬁcant. For example, if the perturbation in

upper state, Vmk = 30 Hz, one has the enrichment, β ≃ 1%. Enrichment at this level can

easily be measured. It is important that the enrichment peak at Ω ≃ −ω is narrow (the

width ≃ Γ) and thus can be distinguished from much wider structures (the width ≃ ΓB)

induced by population eﬀects.

the conversion rate in relative units,

Equilibration rate in the system is given by γ, see Eq. (24). It is convenient to characterize

γrel = γ/γf ree − 1,

(27)

Conversion rate, like enrichment, has two peaks in its frequency dependence at low G. If

Rabi frequency, G, is large and the ortho-para couplings in upper and low states have the

same order of magnitude, conversion can be signiﬁcantly enhanced (Fig. 4, upper panel).

Again, this enhancement appears because of the crossing of ortho and para states in upper

vibrational state by external ﬁeld.

IV. DISCUSSION

The phenomenon considered in the paper is based on the level splitting produced by

resonant electromagnetic radiation. Sometimes, this splitting is called in optics the dynamic

Stark eﬀect. The essence of the eﬀect can be understood as follows. Mixing of ortho and
para states depends on magnitude of the perturbation ˆV but also on the ortho-para level

gap. Optical ﬁeld splits the molecular state and thus change the gaps between the ortho and

para states. Conversion rate is signiﬁcantly enhanced when the ortho and para states cross.

Similar enhancement occurs when ortho and para states are crossed by ordinary Stark eﬀect

in an external DC electric ﬁeld [8].

In the same way, one can understand high sensitivity of the phenomenon to weak ortho-

para couplings in excited state. Equilibrium concentrations of ortho and para molecules are

achieved when one has the ortho-to-para ﬂux in excited state equal to the back ﬂux in the

ground vibrational state. Back ﬂux is slow because it is determined by the non-degenerate

ortho-para level pair. On the other hand, the ﬂux in excited state can be signiﬁcantly

enhanced by proper choice of radiation parameters which allows to cross the ortho and para

states in upper vibrational state.

High eﬃciency of the proposed enrichment method can be used to detect weak pertur-

bations in excited vibrational state. First of all, it can be the hyperﬁne perturbations of

the same origin and similar magnitude as the perturbations in the ground vibrational state.

We have seen that hyperﬁne coupling of the order of ∼ 103 Hz is able to convert almost

all molecules in one spin state. One can also detect much weaker interactions in molecules.

In this case one should select the ortho-para level pair in excited vibrational state which is

not mixed by “ordinary” hyperﬁne interactions in order to avoid the weak interaction to be

hidden by stronger, ordinary hyperﬁne interactions. An interesting case is the crossings of

states having opposite parity. Mixing of such ortho and para states can be performed only

by spin-dependent, parity-odd interactions which are not observed in molecules yet.

We have performed analysis of the spin isomer enrichment and conversion governed by

molecular rovibrational excitation. This analysis was done using a few simpliﬁcations. We

have neglected the Doppler broadening of the absorbing transition, degeneracy of molecular

states, and resonant vibrational exchange between excited and unexcited molecules. These

simpliﬁcations are not crucial for the existence of the phenomenon. More detailed analysis

will be done elsewhere.

We have shown that coherent control of nuclear spin conversion in molecules can be

eﬃciently performed by strong radiation resonant to rovibrational molecular transition. A

possible applications of this phenomenon is the enrichment of molecular spin isomers. An-

other application is the detection of very weak (10−100 Hz) interactions in molecules, which

can be, e.g., parity-odd interactions.

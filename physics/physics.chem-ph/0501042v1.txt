Abstract

We present a theoretical study of wetting phenomena and interactions between liquid–vapor
interfaces based on the density functional theory. The focus is mostly on the impact of long-range
van der Waals interactions both within the ﬂuid and between the ﬂuid and substrate. For the
latter, we consider two models – hard wall and soft wall approximations – diﬀering by the role
of steric eﬀects and leading to a qualitatively diﬀerent character of phase transitions. We compute
numerically the disjoining and conjoining potentials (which are important dynamically for spreading,
spinodal dewetting, and coarsening in thin ﬁlms, as well as resolution of interfacial singularities),
and loci of intermediate and complete wetting transitions as functions of the Hamaker constant and
temperature. We ﬁnd that taking into account short-range interactions is essential for the description
of wetting transitions in the soft wall limit. We derive an analytical form of the disjoining potential
and analyze it in the context of the complete, frustrated and partial wetting.

Introduction

Recent studies of dynamic behavior of thin ﬂuid ﬁlms and three-phase contact lines showed the crucial
role of precursor layers in contact line dynamics and droplet interaction in the course of spinodal dewet-
ting and coarsening [1, 2, 3]. While the role of precursor layers in wetting and spreading phenomena
had been discussed for a long time [4], only recently it was realized that the motion of contact lines is
strongly inﬂuenced by the precursor layers even when the ﬂuid is not completely wetting [1, 5].

Intermediate wetting transitions leading to the formation of mesoscopic ﬂuid layers, as distinct from
complete wetting when a macroscopic layer is formed, were discovered long time ago [6, 7, 8, 9], and
observed recently experimentally on solid [10] and liquid [11, 12, 13, 14, 15] substrates. Both complete
and intermediate wetting transitions are assumed to incorporate both short and long-range interactions.
However, a well formulated theoretical study which justiﬁes the individual impact of such interactions
is still missing, though it is recognized as a prime theoretical subject of interest in view of recent
experimental observations and their partial agreement with available phenomenological models [16].

The mesoscopic dynamic diﬀuse interface theory [1, 2] uses the wide separation between the width
of mesoscopic layers and the scale of hydrodynamic motion to reduce the hydrodynamic equations to
a generalized Cahn–Hilliard equation where the disjoining potential of the ﬂuid layer [17] serves as
the driving force of the ﬂuid motion along the ﬁlm. A similar approach applied to a mesoscopic layer
separating two identical bulk ﬂuid phases can be used for the description of coalescence dynamics, and
has been recently discussed in connection to resolving an interfacial singularity in viscous ﬂow [18].

The cited works used model expressions for the disjoining potential obtained in the sharp interface
approximation, while emphasizing the essential role of the diﬀuse character of the vapor-liquid inter-
face (known already to van der Waals [19]) for resolving the interfacial singularities. The dynamic
importance of the disjoining potential in mesoscopic layers necessitates, however, precise computation
linking it to molecular interactions in the ﬂuid and between the ﬂuid and substrate. The adequate
tool for these computations is density functional theory (DFT) [20]; further reduction to a local (van

1

der Waals–Landau–Cahn) theory through small gradient expansion is invalid when the interaction is
long-range (i.e. has a power decay [21]). Numerical DFT computations were carried out in the con-
text of phenomenological phase transition studies [6, 22] without emphasis on computation of disjoining
potential.

In this communication, we explore this problem anew using the simplest long-range interaction po-
tential, which allows for a direct link between the wetting properties and thermodynamics of a van der
Waals ﬂuid. We pay special attention to the character of interactions in the vicinity of the substrate,
distinguishing between “hard wall” and “soft wall” limits. The ﬁrst version used in earlier computa-
tions [22] exaggerates steric density depletion near the substrate, and the opposite limit may be more
relevant for rough solid interfaces, as well as for ﬁlms on liquid substrates. The character of wetting
transitions interactions, as well as properties of the precursor layer, are very much diﬀerent in both lim-
its. It is found that the analysis in the soft wall approximation based solely on van der Waals disagrees
with results of recent experiments on binary ﬂuid systems [11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. We included therefore a
weak dependence on short-range interactions; the expression for the disjoining potential modiﬁed in this
way was found to be in a good qualitative agreement with the experiment.

2 Density functional equations

Our starting point is the free energy functional written in the density functional approximation [23] as

F =

ρ(r)f [ρ(r)] d3r +

ρ(r) d3r

U (r′)[ρ(r + r′) − ρ(r)] d3r′,

(1)

Z

1
2

Z

Zr′>d

where f (ρ) is free energy per particle of a homogeneous ﬂuid and U (r′) is an isotropic pair interaction
kernel with a short-scale cut-oﬀ d. The functional (1) is written in the form [24] separating the contri-
bution of density inhomogeneities, expressed by the last term vanishing in a homogeneous ﬂuid, but is
equivalent to an alternative form used in earlier works [21].

The chemical potential µ = δF /δρ enters the respective Euler–Lagrange equation obtained by min-
ρ d3r, which deﬁnes the equilibrium

imizing the grand ensemble thermodynamic potential Φ = F − µ
density distribution ρ(r):

R

g(ρ) − µ +

U (r′)[ρ(r + r′) − ρ(r)] d3r′ = 0,

Zr′>d

where g(ρ) = d[ρf (ρ)]/dρ. The function F (ρ) = ρ[f (ρ) − µ] should have two minima ρ± corresponding
to two stable uniform equilibrium states of higher and lower density (liquid and vapor).

A simple example of long-range potential is the modiﬁed Lennard–Jones potential with hard-core

repulsion:

where d is the nominal hard-core molecular diameter. The interaction kernel U (r) gives the free energy
density of a homogeneous van der Waals ﬂuid [24]

an integration variable the squared distance q = r2 = ξ2 + z2, where ξ is radial distance in the lateral
plane. Taking note that the lower integration limit for q is q0 = z2 at |z| > d, q0 = d2 at |z| ≤ d, we

An example of a density proﬁle obtained by solving numerically Eq. (10) is shown in Fig. 1. The
density tail asymptotics can be estimated by considering a location far removed from the interface
placed at the origin [|z| ≫ 1 in the dimensionless units of Eq. (10)] where a sharp interface limit can be
ρ/ρ ∼ 1/|z|3 ≪ 1 . Inserting this in (11)
implemented. The density is presented as ρ = ρ±0 +
and linearizing around ρ = ρ±0 , we see that the densities inside the integral are well approximated in the
leading order by the two limiting constants, which is equivalent to the sharp interface limit. For example,
for the vapor tail at z > 0, |z| ≫ 1 we have ρ(z) = ρ−0 and ρ(z + ζ) = ρ+
0 for ζ > |z|, ρ(z + ζ) = ρ−0 for
ζ < |z|. Thus, we obtain

This is in good agreement to the numerical solution, as seen in the inset of Fig. 1. One can check
a posteriori using this expression that the contribution to the integral of neighboring locations with
|ζ| = O(1) is of a higher order ∝ |z|−

5 and therefore can be neglected.

Interacting ﬂuid-vapor interfaces

If two ﬂat ﬂuid-vapor interfaces are in close proximity, the equilibrium chemical potential and surface
tension become dependent on their mutual separation h. This phenomenon is relevant for processes of
topology change, e.g. droplet coalescence. The corrections due to proximity of interfaces in the case when
a gas layer separates two identical semi-inﬁnite bulk liquids can be obtained by ﬁnding a homoclinic
solution of Eq. (10) satisfying the asymptotic conditions ρ(±∞) = ρ+. A stationary solution of such
kind exists at certain values of µ shifted downwards from the Maxwell construction level µ0. The shift
∆µc = µ0 − µ corresponds to the conjoining potential expressing the interaction of two identical ﬂat
interfaces.

asymptotic form (12) depicted by the dashed line.

A rough but qualitatively correct approximation can be obtained by computing molecular interactions
between two sharp interfaces [18]. The shift of chemical potential necessary to keep two interfaces
separated by a distance h in the state of equilibrium is determined in this approximation by the decrement
of the integral in Eq. (10) due to replacing gas by liquid at z > h. For the purpose of a qualitative
estimate, the sharp-interface computation valid at h ≫ 1 can be extended also to small separations,
(h ≤ 1) to ﬁnd [18]

Equilibrium of a layer between two interfaces is unstable; the instability is, however, very weak when
separation of interfaces is large compared to the molecular scale. Localized small perturbations decay
under these conditions due to surface tension, and a large disturbance is needed to create a critical
nucleus initiating the topology change.



A precise dependence is obtained by solving numerically Eq. (10). The solution is found by ﬁxing
some trial value of µ and solving Eq. (10) iteratively to ﬁnd a stationary proﬁle ρ(z) at this value. The

The computation results for β = 9 are shown by dots in Fig. 2. The curve ∆µc(h) expressing this
dependence well ﬁts the computational results shifted by a certain value h⋆, equal to ≈ 1.39 in this
particular computation. A shift is necessary because, while the separation in Eq. (13) can be formally
arbitrarily small, no stationary solution of Eq. (10) can exist below a certain value of h which corresponds
to a critical size required for nucleation of a critical 1D “bubble”. The applied shift equals to the width
of this “bubble” computed according to Eq. (14).

In the following, we shall consider a ﬂat interface parallel to the substrate surface z = 0, and
suppose that liquid-substrate interactions are also of the van der Waals type with a modiﬁed constant

The ﬁrst term contains the same local part as in Eq. (7) complemented by the liquid-substrate interaction
energy. The latter is computed by integrating the attracting part of the ﬂuid-ﬂuid and ﬂuid-substrate
interaction energy laterally as in Eq. (8) and represents the shift of energy compared to the unbounded
ﬂuid. The term ρ(z)/2 compensates lost ﬂuid-ﬂuid interactions in the substrate domain which are
included in the homogeneous part f (ρ).

Computation of the function ψl(z) depends on steric constraints imposed upon ﬂuid molecules in the

vicinity of the substrate. We consider two limiting cases:

(i) Soft wall approximation (SWA) which allows for ﬂuid molecules to penetrate up to the surface of

the substrate.

(ii) Hard wall approximation (HWA) which imposes steric constraints preventing the centers of ﬂuid
molecules from approaching the substrate at distances shorter than the hard-core cutoﬀ d.

To be deﬁnite, we place the origin of the coordinate system on the centerline of the ﬁrst row of the

substrate atoms. In the soft wall approximation, the computation yields

The equilibrium chemical potential is shifted from the Maxwell construction, µ = µ0 in the proximity

4.2 Equilibrium solutions

The sign of χ distinguishes a perfectly wetting ﬂuid at χ > 0 and a “nonwetting” ﬂuid forming a
ﬁnite contact angle at χ < 0.
In the latter case, there are two branches of equilibrium solutions of
Eq. (19) parametrized by the disjoining potential ∆µd. The stable branch with small h is characterized
by a monotonic density proﬁle and corresponds to the vapor phase thickening to a relatively dense
adsorbate or precursor layer near the substrate. The unstable branch with larger h is characterized
by a non-monotonic density proﬁle and corresponds to a liquid layer with a slightly depleted density
near the substrate. Instability is characteristic to any layer of a nonwetting ﬂuid, but it is very weak
when separation of the vapor-liquid and liquid-substrate interfaces is large compared to the molecular
scale. The contact angle can be expressed through the disjoining potential for the case |χ| ≪ 1 when a

where h = h0 is the precursor layer thickness deﬁned by the condition µ(h0) = µ0 or ∆µd(h0) = 0.

Figures 5(a) and 6(a) present typical equilibrium curves ∆µd(h), respectively, for the SWA and HWA.
Examples of the corresponding density proﬁles are shown in Fig. 5(b) and 6(b). All solutions exhibit a
3 tail at large h, in agreement to calculations performed in the sharp interface approximation
∆µd ∼ h−
[24]. Oscillatory density tails cannot appear in our model, unlike more sophisticated nonlocal DFT
computations [25]. Although the curves ∆µd(h) are qualitatively similar to those obtained in the sharp
interface approximation [24], the quantitative distinctions strongly inﬂuence the character of the wetting
transition, as will be emphasized in the following.

4.3 Comparison between HWA and SWA

Investigating numerically the two above substrate-liquid interaction models we can distinguish between
two main diﬀerences in the interaction properties: the emergence of “microscopic” solutions, identiﬁed
with nanoscale precursor layers and transition to layers of mesoscopic or macroscopic thickness. The
three classes of ﬁlms correspond, respectively to h ∼ O(1), h ∼ O(10), h > O(102) (measured on the
molecular scale d).

4.3.1 Precursor layer

Stable equilibrium solutions with a ﬁnite thickness h = h0, which correspond to a microscopic precursor
layer, exist at the liquid-vapor equilibrium chemical potential µ = µ0. An example of the dependence of
the dimensionless precursor layer thickness on the inverse temperature β is shown in Fig. 7(a). One can
see a strong diﬀerence between SWA and HWA results. In the HWA computation, the value of h0 at
the chosen value of the Hamaker constant is much less than unity, unless near the critical temperature
β = βc ≃ 3.37, so that one can speak of a dilute adsorption layer rather than of a proper precursor.
This diﬀerence stems from an eﬀective increase of the absolute value of the Hamaker constant due to
the presence of a dilute layer of steric origin present in HWA.

On the other hand, by ﬁxing the value of β and varying χ, one ﬁnds that a precursor layer may exist
only above a critical value χ > χ−c , as shown in Fig. 7(b). When the layer thickness is deﬁned by the
integral expression (21), this transition loses a qualitative character, and the value χ−c can be deﬁned as a
point where ∆µd(h0) = 0 [see Fig. 8(a)]. This happens at χ = χ−c (β) = −(1 − ρ−/ρ+), so that the lower

limit is identical for both models (see Fig. 9). According to the integral formula, negative values are
possible, and may appear when ﬂuid-substrate interactions are so weak that the ﬂuid is nonwetting even
at vapor densities. Moreover, at χ slightly above χ−c , the topology of the curves ∆µd(h) for the HWA
model changes: the curve becomes discontinuous, and the microscopic and macroscopic branches of the
curve separate, as seen in Fig. 8(a). The discontinuity is explained by the absence of the vapor-ﬂuid
coexistence above some critical value of the chemical potential as shown in the inset of Fig. 8(a). The
sequence of density proﬁles in the vicinity of χ = χ−c is shown in Fig. 8(b).

4.3.2 Wetting transitions
A precursor ﬁlm exists within the interval χ−c < χ < χ+
c . The latter limit corresponds to the wetting
transition, as presented in Fig. 7(b). One can see a qualitative diﬀerence between the SWA and the
HWA models. For SWA, the precursor thickness grows continuously as χ increases, and diverges at
χ = χ+
c = 0, indicating a second-order transition to complete wetting. For HWA, the precursor layer
approaches a ﬁnite thickness at ﬁnite χ = χ+
c , indicating a ﬁrst order transition to wetting. The locus
of the wetting transition χ = χ+

c (β) is determined by numerical computation (see Fig. 9).

The two limiting cases of SWA and HWA correspond to compliant (ﬂuid or rough solid) or molecularly
smooth solid substrates, respectively. Recently the transitions of both kind (ﬁrst and second order) were
found in experiments on liquid substrates [15, 26]. The quantitative disagreement between the SWA
results discussed here and in the later experiments is due to the absence of short range interactions in
our computations. A more complete picture of wetting transitions in SWA arises when, in addition to
long-range interactions, short-range forces between the ﬂuid molecules and the substrate are taken into
account [15, 16]. While concentrating in the following on short-range interactions in SWA, we refer the
reader to Ref. [22] which describes the impact of short-range interactions in HWA.

4.4 Short-range interactions in SWA

Computation of repulsive short-range interactions in the soft wall approximation takes into account polar
interactions. In the simplest description, the interaction kernel for short-range forces has an exponential
decay [27, 28]:

where λ > 0. Some other forms can be also used here [29]. Unlike the computation of ψl, no cutoﬀ is
required, and the lower integration limit is q0 = (z − ζ)2. This yields

The derived analytical form of the disjoining potential (26) is presented in Fig. 10. A comparison with
direct numerical integration of (25) shows a good agreement already at h < O(10) values.

A qualitative nature of wetting transitions can be captured via a simple analysis of the disjoining
potential (26) at the equilibrium chemical potential µ = µ0 and thus ∆µd = 0. We distinguish between
three characteristic types of behavior which are attributed to the three corresponding wetting regions:

10

Complete wetting - there is a single diverging solution (h → ∞) at χ > 0, ∆µd = 0, which corre-

sponds to a macroscopic layer.

Frustrated complete wetting - three solutions exist for χ > 0, two of which are ﬁnite and the third
one is diverging. The two ﬁnite solutions have distinct scales, molecular (“microscopic”) and
mesoscopic.

Partial wetting - two solutions exist for χ < 0, where one is ﬁnite on a molecular scale and the other

one diverges.

The separating boundary between the partial and frustrated complete wetting depends solely on the
sign change of the Hamaker constant, χ. The transition from frustrated to complete wetting occurs at
a certain critical value of η = ηc when the maximum of the curve ∆µd(h) crosses zero; this happens at
a critical thickness h = hc deﬁned as

∆µd(hc) = 0,

= 0,

< 0 .

The dependence ∆µd(h) at η = ηc is shown by the upper curve in Fig. 11. This corresponds to a
discontinuous (ﬁrst order) intermediate wetting transition from microscopic to mesocopic ﬁlms. The
lower curve with an inﬂection point in Fig. 11 corresponds to a continuous (second order) intermediate
wetting transition, which is observed at a certain shifted value of chemical potential ∆µd < 0.

Figure 12 summarizes these three transitions in the χ − η plane. The critical point χ = η = 0 marks
the critical end point [26] and corresponds to the sign change of the Hamaker constant; all three above
wetting regions converge at the critical end point. Changing the inverse temperature β (for constant
values of η) does not change this picture in a qualitative way.

according to Eq. 26. The lower line (η = 0.00344) corresponds to the continuous intermediate wetting
transition. The upper line (η = ηc = 0.00407) corresponds to onset of the frustrated complete wetting.
The solid/dashed lines represent stable/unstable solutions, respectively. The Parameters: β = 9 and

5 Discussion

In the current study we have presented an analysis of wetting phenomena and interactions between liquid-
vapor interfaces at microscopic, mesoscopic and macroscopic distances based on the density functional
theory (DFT). The study is centered on computation of disjoining and conjoining potentials (which are
important for dynamic computations). Focusing on the role of long-range van der Walls interactions,
we considered two models – hard wall and soft wall approximations – diﬀering by the role of steric
eﬀects. The distinct models lead to a qualitatively diﬀerent character of wetting transitions. A ﬁrst
order transition from partial to complete wetting occurs in the hard wall model only, turning to a second
order transition in the soft wall model.

at the equilibrium chemical potential ∆µd = 0. The dashed line depicts the continuous intermediate
wetting transition at ∆µd < 0.

To capture a more realistic description of wetting transitions, we included a weak dependence on
short-range polar interactions. Analytical derivation of the disjoining potential was carried out exploiting
the sharp interface approximation, which showed a good agreement with a direct numerical solution of
DFT Euler-Lagrange integral equations. We ﬁnd that the qualitative nature of the sequence of wetting
transitions stems from a competition between short- and long-scale interactions, best seen in the (χ, η)
1 or short-range decay range λ have
parametric plane, while all other parameters, like temperature β−
only a quantitative eﬀect. The role of repulsive short-range interactions is analogous to steric eﬀects,
which are emphasized in the hard wall approximation. Thus, the presented simple model reproduces
all major types of wetting transitions (between partial to complete/frustrating wetting and thin/thick
precursor in coexistence with bulk ﬂuid) of [14, 15, 16, 26] as summarized in Fig. 12.

Abstract
Theoretical model of the coherent control of nuclear spin isomers by microwave radiation has
been developed. Model accounts the M -degeneracy of molecular states and molecular center-of-
mass motion. The model has been applied to the 13CH3F molecules. Microwave radiation excites
the para state (J=11,K=1) which is mixed by the nuclear spin-spin interaction with the ortho state
(9,3). Dependencies of the isomer enrichment and conversion rates on the radiation frequency have
been calculated. Both spectra consist of two resonances situated at the centers of allowed and
forbidden (by nuclear spin) transitions in the molecule. Larger enrichment, up to 7%, can be
produced by strong radiation resonant to the forbidden transition. The spin conversion rate can
be increased by 2 orders of magnitude at this resonance.

INTRODUCTION

Nuclear spin isomers of symmetrical molecules are fascinating objects [1]. Their properties
are determined by nuclei’ spins deeply hidden in the molecule. Most known are the hydrogen
isomers that demonstrate anomalous stability, 1 year at ambient temperature and pressure
[2]. Latest results on hydrogen isomers can be found in [3, 4] and references therein. Many
other molecules have spin isomers too. But so far their physical properties remain almost
unknown. This makes investigations of spin isomers fundamentally important. Spin isomers
have also practical applications, e.g., as spin labels, in isomer selective chemical reactions
[5, 6], or in isomer enhanced NMR technique [7, 8]. These applications are developed solely
with hydrogen isomers. Extension to other molecules needs eﬃcient methods of isomer
enrichment. For a long time enrichment of only hydrogen isomers was possible. Recently a
few separation methods for polyatomic molecules have been developed (see the review [9])
that has advanced the ﬁeld signiﬁcantly. Further progress needs new enrichment methods.
New approach to the problem of isomer enrichment is based on the use of strong elec-
tromagnetic radiation. There are two modiﬁcations of the method. In the ﬁrst one [10, 11]
(earlier discussion of the radiation eﬀects see in [12]), radiation populates speciﬁc states of
one spin isomer situated in the vicinity of states of other isomer that consequently results
in the enrichment. In the second method [13], enrichment appears due to combined action
of population transfer, dynamical shift of molecular levels and light induced coherence. The
latter method (coherent control of spin isomers) promises to be more eﬃcient. To avoid
any confusion, we note that the light-induced enrichment resulting from stimulating con-
version of spin species diﬀers radically from the previously known separation methods, e.g.,
light-induced drift method which separates physically the isomers [9].

There are no proofs yet that light-induced enrichment of spin isomers is feasible. We
are aware of only one attempt to verify the proposals. It was done by microwave excita-
tion of rotational transition in CH3F. The experiment did not give a positive result. At
the time when this experiment was performed, only a qualitative theoretical model of the
light-induced enrichment was available [10]. Presently, the understanding of the underly-
ing physics has been improved substantially. In view of further experiments in this area it
is desirable to examine the microwave induced enrichment of CH3F spin isomers in more
detail. This is the goal of the present paper. Existing theoretical models of coherent con-
trol cannot be used for quantitative analysis directly because of their lacking to account the
M-degeneracy of molecular states. Account of such degeneracy is another goal of this paper.

II. QUALITATIVE PICTURE AND KINETIC EQUATION

Previous analysis has shown that signiﬁcant enrichment can be obtained if radiation
interacts with the states having large diﬀerence in populations. In this context, microwave
excitation is not the best option but it has some advantages also. Theoretical description
is simpler for pure rotational excitation. The levels positions are better known for ground
vibrational states. From the experimental side, it is easier to ﬁnd a radiation having proper
frequency because of better frequency tunability of microwave sources.

We start with brief qualitative description of the phenomenon. CH3F has two types of
states, ortho and para, shown in Fig. 1. The data in this ﬁgure correspond to the 13CH3F
molecule and have been calculated using the molecular parameters from [14]. Spin isomers
of CH3F are distinguished by the total spin of the three hydrogen nuclei, I = 3/2 for

2

ortho and I = 1/2 for para isomers. For ortho isomers only rotational quantum numbers
K = 0, 3, 6.. are allowed (K is the projection of molecular angular momentum, J, on the
molecular symmetry axis.) For para molecules only K = 1, 2, 4, 5... are allowed [1].

−

There are two close pairs of ortho and para states in the ground vibrational state of
13CH3F that are signiﬁcantly mixed by the intramolecular perturbation, ˆV , and that are
important for the ortho-para conversion in the molecule. For a qualitative description, let
us take into account only one of these pairs, m
n, and assume that there is no external
radiation yet. Suppose that the test molecule is placed into the ortho subspace. Due to the
rotational relaxation caused by collisions, the molecule starts to shuttle up and down along
the ladder of rotational states. Nonmagnetic collisions do not change the nuclear spin state
directly, i.e., the relevant cross-section is zero, σ(ortho
para) = 0. This shuttling along the
|
rotational states inside the ortho subspace continues until the molecule jumps to the state
m. During the free ﬂight after that collision the intramolecular perturbation, ˆV , admixes
the para states n to the ortho state m. Consequently, the next collision has a probability
(usually very small) to transfer the molecule to other para states. This localizes the molecule
inside the para subspace and the spin conversion occurs. This is the mechanism of radiation
free nuclear spin conversion induced by the intramolecular state mixing [15] (see also [16]).
n in the
para subspace, mixing of the states is aﬀected by the radiation which allows to control
the ortho-para conversion. Inﬂuence of a radiation comes through the three major eﬀects,
level shift (dynamical Stark eﬀect, well-known in nonlinear laser spectroscopy [17, 18]), level
population change, and light-induced coherence. In general, these three components cannot
be separated and work together.

In case of a strong microwave radiation applied to the molecular transition q

−

In order to consider a real molecule, the above simpliﬁed picture has to be developed
further. One has to account the molecular center-of-mass motion. Although the intramolec-
ular mixing does not depend on molecular velocity, the radiation-molecular interaction does.
Consequently, the ortho-para state mixing in coherent control depends on molecular velocity
too.

Another complication comes from the degeneracy of molecular states. Even for the sim-
plest case of pure radiation polarization (linear or circular) there are many excitation chan-
nels each having its own absorption coeﬃcient and saturation parameter. These channels
diﬀer by M-quantum number, projection of J on the laboratory axis of quantization. It is
important also to keep in mind that there are other degeneracies of states. Each state of
13CH3F in Fig. 1 is determined by the set of rotational quantum numbers (J, K, M), total
spin of three hydrogen, I, its projections on the laboratory z-axis, σ, and z-projects of spins
of carbon and ﬂuorine nuclei, both having spin 1/2. The energy of rotational states of CH3F
depends only on J and K quantum numbers, if tiny hyperﬁne contribution to the level
energy is neglected. We end the qualitative picture by summarizing important parameters
of 13CH3F in Table 1.

Quantitative analysis of the isomer coherent control will be performed using kinetic equa-

tion for the density matrix, ˆρ. The molecular Hamiltonian reads,

ˆH =

(¯h2/2m0)

r + ˆH0 + ¯h ˆG + ¯h ˆV .

(1)

Here the ﬁrst term is the Hamiltonian of the molecular center-of-mass motion with m0 being
the molecular mass. The main part of the molecular internal Hamiltonian, ˆH0, has the eigen
ortho and para states shown in Fig. 1. ¯h ˆG describes the molecular interactions with the

where E0, ωL and k are the amplitude, frequency and wave vector of the electromagnetic
radiation, respectively; ˆd is the operator of the molecular electric dipole moment. ˆV is the
intramolecular perturbation that mixes the ortho and para states in 13CH3F. The mixing of
n pair (J=9,K=3–11,1) is performed by the spin-spin interaction between the molecular
m
nuclei [16, 19], The pair m′
n′ (20,3–21,1) is mixed by the spin-spin and spin-rotation inter-
actions [16, 20, 21, 22]. Account of the level degeneracy for the light-molecular interaction
is a diﬃcult problem, in general. It is most simple for the case of pure polarization, linear
or circular. We will consider the electromagnetic radiation having linear polarization.

In the representation of the eigen states of ˆH0 (α-states) and classical description of the

molecular center-of-mass motion, kinetic equation reads [17],

Here S is the collision integral; v is the molecular center-of-mass velocity. Spontaneous
decay is not included in this equation because it is negligible for rotational transitions in

In Eq. (8), two relaxation rates were introduced, rotational relaxation (νr) that does not
aﬀect molecular velocity and translational relaxation (νt) that equilibrates velocity but do
not change rotational state. Note that the rotational relaxation is accompanied in our model
by the relaxation in M quantum numbers. Note also, that the collisions in the model do not
change the molecular spin state. The introduction of diﬀerent relaxation rates for diﬀerent
degrees of freedom makes the model of strong collisions more accurate and ﬂexible. It allows
to adjust the model to the particular experimental conditions. Because of its simplicity
model of strong collisions is often used in laser physics and nonlinear spectroscopy, see, e.g.,
[17, 24, 25]. Numerical values for the collisional parameters Γ, νr, and νt will be determined
later.

where Rlow = limS→0 R is the Foigt proﬁle of the absorption line. If Γ
kv0 the absorption
line is Lorentzian having the width equal Γ. Experimental data on χ(Ω) for the rotational
transition 11, 1
12, 1 can be used to determine the value of Γ. Equally, broadening
of any other rotational transition can be used because in our collision model (6) one has
the same Γ for all oﬀ-diagonal density matrix elements. There are experimental results on
the broadening of the ortho-para transition (9,3)–(11,1) obtained from the level-crossing
resonances in 13CH3F nuclear spin conversion. This experiment gave the value Γ/P =
108 s−1/Torr [27, 28] that will be used in the present calculations. The last unknown
1.9
parameter, rotational relaxation, νr, can be determined, e.g., from the power saturation of
the absorption coeﬃcient. This information is not available and we assume νr = Γ. This is
reasonable, because the pressure broadening in molecules is determined mainly by the level
population quenching, although this estimation for νr is probably too high.

·

J + 1, K

We can now demonstrate the model at work by considering the microwave absorption by
13CH3F. Absorption spectrum is determined by the selection rules J
K. The
spectrum consists of groups of lines nearly equally separated by 50 GHz. Inside each group
the lines, diﬀerent in K, are rather dense. Spectrum near the line 11, 1
12, 1 is shown in
Fig. 2. The two spectra correspond to low radiation intensity and to S = 100 mW/cm2 and
the gas pressure equal 30 mTorr in both cases.
Saturation intensity for the line 11, 1

12, 1 is equal to 43 W/cm2 (M = 11) and
6.8 W/cm2 (M = 0) at the gas pressure 1 Torr. Ssat is proportional to the pressure squared,
6 mW/cm2. An example of the absorption coeﬃcient saturation
thus at 30 mTorr, Ssat ≃
is given in Fig. 3. Because the Doppler width of the transition is small, kv0 = 0.74 MHz,
low ﬁeld absorption in the line center depends weakly on CH3F pressure if P >
100 mTorr.
∼
Another example of the saturation eﬀect is shown in Fig. 4. Here the relative level population
ρp(q)]/ρp∆w is given as a function of radiation intensity. One can see that
diﬀerence [ρp(n)
radiation having S = 100 mW/cm2 decreases the level population diﬀerence signiﬁcantly.

i[G, ρ′′]

i[V, ρ′].

Ortho-para conversion is determined by the terms ρ′′
mn because zero order matrix
elements oﬀ-diagonal in nuclear spins vanish (see Eq. (4)). Radiation does not aﬀect the
levels m′ and n′. Consequently, the matrix element ρ′′

V. CONVERSION RATES

Solutions for ρ′′

m′n′ and ρ′′

Interpretation of the introduced conversion rates can be considered as follows. Strong
resonant radiation splits the molecular states, change the levels populations and introduce
coherences in the molecule. The ﬁeld dependent part of γpo can be considered as due to the
ω1. The ﬁrst term of γn is
radiation induced level crossing. This term has resonance at Ω =
due to the population eﬀect. It has the resonance at Ω = 0 where the excitation probability
has maximum. The second part of γn is due to the population change and level-crossing.
ω1. The coherent contribution, γc, has also
It has two resonances, at Ω = 0 and at Ω =
resonances at these two frequencies.

−

The two peaks in the conversion rate spectra have rather distinctive features. The ﬁrst
one, at Ω = 0, is quite similar to the radiation free conversion rate, e.g., γ′
po (Eq. (30)). In
our case ω
Γ and the amplitudes of the peaks at Ω = 0 are proportional to Γ, thus to
the gas pressure. In the limit ω
Γ, contributions to the conversion rate provided by these
terms are similar to the ordinary gas kinetic processes which are proportional to the gas
pressure also.

≫

≫

The resonances at Ω = ω1 have completely diﬀerent signature that would result from a
ﬁeld free conversion pattern of a degenerate ortho-para level pair. In this case the conversion
rate has 1/Γ dependence, see, e.g., Eq. (30).
It allows us to refer to the resonances at
Ω = ω1 as produced by the crossing the ortho and para levels and resulting from the applied
ω1, let us estimate
electromagnetic ﬁeld. To reveal this property of the resonances at Ω =

the integrand in Eq. (35) has sharp resonance at v = 0. One can substitute f (v) by f (0) in
1/kv0. Thus, the conversion is produced through the degenerate
Eq. (35) and obtain, I

It would be useful to compare the results of the present model with the qualitative model
[10]. This comparison cannot be made directly because in [10] rovibrational excitation of
CH3F was considered. But one can apply the idea of light-induced enrichment solely through
the level population change and make the comparison. In the present notations, the ﬁeld
eﬀect from the level population change is given by the ﬁrst term in Eq. (32),

It gives larger amplitude for the peak at Ω = 0 than the present model.
In the present
model one has partial cancellation of peaks at Ω = 0, see the ﬁrst terms in the expressions
for γn and γc. Because of the assumption, Γ = νr, made in the collision model we have two
times smaller peak at Ω = 0 in the present model. The cancellation is less signiﬁcant if Γ is
larger in comparison with νr.

Calculation of the rates γpo, γn, and γc needs the matrix elements Vmn. Mixing of the
states m and n is performed by the intramolecular spin-spin interaction between the nuclei
of 13CH3F. Dependence of Vmn on nuclear spin variables is accounted easily by summation
because other factors in Eqs. (31)-(33) do not depend on nuclear spins. Then, the only
remaining degeneracy is in M-quantum numbers. This quantity reads,

than at 100 mTorr. There is also peak at Ω = 0 having “negative amplitude” but it is too

despite the rates γpo and γop have rather large ﬁeld dependent parts (see Fig. (5)), they alone
would not produce an enrichment. It can be understood because these ﬁeld dependent parts
are due to the mixing of states shifted by radiation but having equilibrium populations (see
Eq. (31)). Conversion through the mixing of equilibrium populated states does not aﬀect the
ortho-to-para ratio. Examples of the enrichment β(Ω) are given in Fig. 6. At the pressure

The simpliﬁed model that accounts only the radiation-induced level population change
predicts a factor two higher peak at Ω = 0 than the present model. As was discussed above,
in the present model one has partial cancellation of contributions originated from the rates
γn and γc which results in a smaller enrichment. Another signiﬁcant diﬀerence between these
models is that the simpliﬁed model does not predict an enrichment at Ω =

ω1.

Broadening of the two peaks in enrichment is very distinctive and is similar to the peaks

of conversion rate, although there is some diﬀerence. The enrichment peak at Ω =
is broader than the peak of γ because of large γpo and γop at resonant frequency in the
denominator of Eq. (40).

VII. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

We have developed a model of spin isomer coherent control that accounts for the molec-
ular level degeneracy in magnetic quantum numbers. This degeneracy together with the
account of molecular center-of-mass motion allow now to apply the model to real molecules,
having actual level structure and ortho-para mixing Hamiltonian. The developed model was
used to analyse the microwave induced enrichment of spin isomers in 13CH3F. Spectrum of
ω1 being two orders of
the conversion rate consists of two peaks with the peak at Ω =
magnitude higher than the peak at Ω = 0.

30 mTorr at room temperature and radiation intensity S = 100 mW/cm2. Amplitude of the
peak at Ω = 0 is 4 times smaller. Cooling the gas to 200 K would increase enrichment to
5% because of the increase of the level population diﬀerence. At higher radiation intensity
7% if T = 200 K.
For the practical implementation of the microwave enrichment, the use of the peak at

Enrichment obtained by microwave excitation of 13CH3F at reasonable experimental con-
ditions is not large,
3%. On the other hand, there are some applications where such
enrichment could be signiﬁcant, e.g., in spin isomer enhanced NMR technique [7, 8]. Note
that for the standard 200 MHz NMR the diﬀerence in Boltzmann factors between Zeeman
10−5. If even a fraction of
states, which determines the amplitude of NMR signal, is only 3
the 3% isomer enrichment would be transported to the Zeeman level populations it would
enhance the NMR signal signiﬁcantly.

·

Apart from any possible applications of microwave enrichment, which is by far too early
to discuss now, observation of the microwave enrichment would have prove-of-principle im-
portance for the coherent control of spin isomers.
It is interesting to note also that the
ω1 would demonstrate an example of enhanced access to weak
isomer enrichment at Ω =
processes in molecules through the isomer enrichment [30]. Suppose, one would like to
ω1 directly. At the conditions considered in the paper,
measure the absorption at Ω =
10−6 cm−1 which is rather diﬃcult to measure. This value has to be compared
χ(
with the 3% enrichment in the coherent control which should not be diﬃcult to measure.

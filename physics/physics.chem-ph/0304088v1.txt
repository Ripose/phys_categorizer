Eﬀect of diﬀerent choices of the Boltzmannized ﬂux operator on thermal exchange
and recombination reactions

Koichi Saito∗

(Dated: November 2, 2013)

The rate constants for recombination and exchange reactions are calculated using the ﬂux corre-
lation approach with a general form of the Boltzmannized ﬂux operator, which can simultaneously
describe the Kubo and traditional half-split forms. First, we consider an exactly solvable model, i.e.,
the free particle case, in terms of a new scaling function. Next, as a non-trivial case, we study the
recombination and exchange reactions at very high pressure. Since the rate constant is calculated
by Laplace transform of the ﬂux correlation function, the result depends on how the Boltzmannized
ﬂux operator is chosen. We ﬁnd that a choice of the ﬂux operator aﬀects the rate constant consid-
erably. For the recombination reaction, the ratio of the rate constant in the half-split form to that
in the Kubo form approaches zero in the high pressure limit.

INTRODUCTION

To study a chemical reaction at the most detailed level, it is necessary to treat the action of the time evolution
i ˆHt) ( ˆH is the Hamiltonian of the system), † onto a (given) initial wave function or density matrix,
operator, exp(
which is a function of total energy E and total angular momentum J. Such quantum scattering calculations have
actually been studied for simple chemical reactions.1 A time-dependent scattering formalism based on the S-matrix
Kohn variational approach2 or a coupled channel method in hyperspherical coordinates3 has usually been used to
evaluate the quantum reactive scattering cross sections. The number of open vibration-rotation channels, however,
increases very rapidly as thermally accessible collision energy becomes high. Therefore, at high energy the exact
quantum state-to-state calculations would not be feasible even for a simple reaction. Furthermore, if it is only the
rate constant that is desired, such a complete calculation for all state-to-state information is not economical.

A totally diﬀerent approach for treating chemical reactions is that based on a correlation between quantum ﬂux
In the early 60’s, Yamamoto4 ﬁrst formulated an exact expression
operators in the statistical thermodynamics.
for the rate constant as an application of the general statistical mechanical theory of irreversible process, which
was established by Kubo et al.5,6 and Mori.7 (See also Ref.8.) Independently, Miller et al.9,10,11 have developed a
method for the rate constant using a time integral of the ﬂux-ﬂux autocorrelation function, which is also exact in
the limit that the dynamics is extended to t
. The feasibility of this approach depends on how to evaluate the
time evolution operator for the system, and the correlation is usually calculated using the Feynman path integral
technique.12,13 Although this method is powerful and convenient to obtain the rate constant, the direct application to
large, complicated systems is still diﬃcult because of the notorious sign problem.14,15 One approach to improve this
situation is a ﬁltering or smoothing technique16 such as the stationary-phase Monte Carlo.17 Recently, semiclassical
(SC) approaches, implemented via the initial-value representation (SC-IVR), have received a rebirth of interest. (Van
Vleck18 ﬁrst discussed a drastic approximation based on the semiclassical picture.) A number of studies19,20,21 have
been carried out along SC-IVR and have demonstrated the capability of these approaches to describe various quantum
eﬀects in chemical reactions.

As mentioned above, there are two diﬀerent ways to calculate the rate constant for chemical reactions, i.e., the
Yamamoto approach, in which the Kubo form of the ﬂux operator is used, and the Miller approach, in which the
traditional half-split form is chosen. The two approaches can provide the same result to the rate constant because
it is given in terms of the integral of the ﬂux-ﬂux correlation function with respect to time.9,11 However, the shapes
of the correlation functions calculated by the two approaches are quite diﬀerent from each other. Therefore, for
the recombination and exchange reactions (like Eqs.(3) and (4)) the rate constants in the two approaches could be
diﬀerent, because they are given by Laplace transforms of the ﬂux-ﬂux correlation functions.29 The purpose of this
paper is to demonstrate the eﬀect of diﬀerent choices of the Boltzmannized ﬂux operator on the rate constants for
recombination and exchange reactions.

First, we summarize the correlation function method brieﬂy in Sec.II. The expressions of the correlation functions
in the Yamamoto and Miller approaches can be uniﬁed using a general form of the Boltzmannized ﬂux operator. The
diﬀerence between the two approaches is discussed explicitly. The rate constants for recombination and exchange
processes are also studied. In Sec.III, we consider an exactly solvable model, i.e., the free particle case, in terms of
a new scaling function. In Sec.IV, as a non-trivial case, we study the recombination and exchange reactions at very
high pressure. Finally, the summary and conclusion are given in Sec.V.

II. FLUX-FLUX CORRELATION APPROACH TO RATE CONSTANTS

The quantum mechanically exact expression for a thermal rate constant k(T ) can be written in terms of the ﬂux

correlation function9‡

where Q0(T ) is the reactant partition function per unit volume and Cs(r; t) is the ﬂux-side correlation function deﬁned
by

k(T ) = Q0(T )−1 lim
t→∞

Cs(r; t),

Cs(r; t) = tr[e−β ˆH ˆF (r) ˆ
P

].

ˆF (r) = i[ ˆH, h(ˆs)]s=r,

Here, ˆF (r) is the bare ﬂux operator given by

with h the Heaviside step function and s the reaction coordinate – see Fig.1. h(s) takes the value of 0(1) in the
reactant (product) side of the dividing point r. In Eq.(6), ˆ
P
= ei ˆHth(ˆp)e−i ˆHt,

is the projection operator deﬁned by

(8)

ˆ
P

with ˆp the momentum operator.

For the rate constant, two diﬀerent approaches have been proposed so far: one is the Yamamoto approach,4 which
is based on the linear response theory (or the so-called Kubo formula),5,6 and the other is the ﬂux-ﬂux autocorrelation
function method developed by Miller et al.9,10,11 In the Miller approach, Eq.(6) are modiﬁed by following two useful
facts: the ﬁrst one is made by noting that ˆ
, and the
P
second is to replace h(ˆp) by h(ˆs) in Eq.(8), which is also correct in the limit t
. By virtue of these modiﬁcations,
the ﬂux-side correlation function in the Miller approach can be rewritten as

and ˆH commute each other (i.e., [ ˆ

Because the rate constants for recombination and exchange processes are calculated by the Laplace transforms
of the correlation functions, it is clear that the evaluated results depend on κ, that is, the shape of the correlation
function aﬀects the rate constants.29 Of course, the integral of the correlation function with respect to time itself does
not depend on κ.

III. SOLVABLE MODEL – FREE PARTICLE CASE

In this section and the next section, we calculate the rate constants for recombination and exchange reactions using
the Feynman path integral technique.12,13 A huge calculation is usually required to obtain the exact matrix elements of
propagators for a realistic system. Furthermore, it is necessary to take some approximations and numerical techniques
to perform it.17,19,20,21,30,31,32 Because the aim of this paper is to show how the rate constant for recombination or
exchange reaction depends on κ (i.e., a choice of the Boltzmannized ﬂux operator), it would be more intuitive and
useful to ﬁrst consider a simple system rather than a complicated case. We here study an analytically solvable model,
i.e., the free particle case in one-dimension, and discuss a non-trivial case in the next section.

If no potential acts on the system (see Fig.3), the propagator in the coordinate representation is easily calculated

by the path integral.12 The ﬂux-ﬂux correlation function Eq.(20) then gives

IV. RATE CONSTANTS AT HIGH PRESSURE LIMIT

As a non-trivial example, we consider the rate constants for recombination and exchange reactions at very high
pressure. As we have seen in the previous section, it is very notable that at short time (or small x) the correlation
function (or the scaling function) in the Yamamoto approach is quite diﬀerent from the other case (κ
= 1). The
rate constant is calculated by the Laplace transform of the correlation function (see Eqs.(21) and (22)), in which the
integrand involves the factor exp(
ηt) and η is proportional to pressure. Thus, at suﬃciently high pressure the rate
constant may be determined by the correlation function at short time (t <
∼

For a short time, the paths which must be considered in evaluating a potential V never move very far from the
initial position. Thus, to a ﬁrst approximation, we can expand the potential V around the average of the initial (s)

In a typical chemical reaction, the interatomic distance and forces usually range over one or two angstroms, and
hence one can expect that the change of the potential is small while the motion of the order of 1˚A has been achieved.

Since the correction due to the potential in Eq.(47) is common to the correlation function for arbitrary κ, the ratio
of the (rr)-rate constant for arbitrary κ to that in the Yamamoto approach (κ = 1) is again given by the ratio for
the free particle case: Rκ

negligibly small.) In Fig.8, we show the ratio Rκ

reduced considerably, which implies that at very high pressure the (rr)-rate constant for κ

that in the Yamamoto approach.

Eq.(48) may not work well for large κ because the peak of the scaling function at x = 0 becomes sharp near κ = 1
(see Fig.4). In the present calculation, we ﬁnd that the (rr)-rate constant in the Yamamoto approach is considerably

V. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION

8

The exact quantum mechanical expression for thermal reaction rates can be formulated by the linear response
theory,5,6,7 which Yamamoto ﬁrst discussed in the early 60’s.4 Later, Miller et al.9,10,11 have independently proposed
a more convenient way, i.e., the ﬂux-ﬂux autocorrelation function method, to perform numerical computations. The
Miller approach can provide the exact rate constant in the limit that the dynamics of the system is extended to
. Using a general form of the Boltzmannized ﬂux operator, we have uniﬁed the two approaches and studied the
t
rate constants for thermal exchange and recombination reactions. Because they are calculated by Laplace transforms
of the ﬂux-ﬂux correlation functions, the result depends on how to choose the Boltzmannized ﬂux operator.

→ ∞

In this paper, we have ﬁrst considered a solvable model, i.e., the free particle case, to demonstrate the dependence
of the rate constant on κ intuitively. To study it, we have introduced a new scaling function and investigated its
properties in detail. As a non-trivial case, we have discussed the (rr)-rate constant at very high pressure. Because
under such conditions the reaction rate is determined by a propagator at short time, the ratio of the rate constant
in the partial-split form of the Boltzmannized ﬂux operator to that in the Yamamoto approach can be described
in terms of the scaling function for the free particle case. We have found that the rate constant for recombination
= 1. In particular, the (rr)-rate constant in
reaction in the Yamamoto approach is larger than that in the case of κ
the Yamamoto approach is about twice as large as that in the Miller approach at α

10.

In conclusion, the partial-split form of the Boltzmannized ﬂux operator is certainly an economical and powerful tool
to perform numerical calculations for thermal rate constants of realistic reactions. However, for the recombination
reaction it may underestimate the rate constant compared with the result calculated by the linear response theory.
The diﬀerence could be seen if the experiments for recombination reactions could be performed under the conditions
of very high pressure.

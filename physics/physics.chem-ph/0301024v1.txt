Abstract

Be2+(aq) hydrolysis can to lead to the formation of multi-beryllium clusters, but
the thermodynamics of this process has not been resolved theoretically. We study
the hydration state of an isolated Be2+ ion using both the quasi-chemical theory of
solutions and ab initio molecular dynamics. These studies conﬁrm that Be2+(aq) is
tetra-hydrated. The quasi-chemical approach is then applied to then the deproto-
+. The calculated pKa of 3.8 is in good
nation of Be(H2O)4
agreement with the experimentally suggested value around 3.5. The calculated en-
ergetics for the formation of [Be · OH · Be]3+ are then obtained in fair agreement
with experiments.

1 Introduction

Beryllium metal has properties that make it technologically very attractive[1],
but these advantages are severely counterbalanced by the high toxicity of
inhaled beryllium dust, which causes chronic beryllium disease in a subset of
exposed individuals [2]. The etiology of this autoimmune disease [3] is poorly
understood, but the ﬁnal disease state is characterized by lung failure.

Aqueous beryllium chemistry is also incompletely understood. Experiments
suggest that beryllium mediated hydrolysis of water leads to the formation of
multi-beryllium clusters [1,4]. This same mechanism is likely involved in the
dissolution of Be2+(aq) and of importance in environmental clean-up strate-
gies. Such mechanisms likely underlie deposition of beryllium in biomaterials,

and thus perhaps in the development of chronic beryllium disease. Thus a
molecular understanding of Be2+(aq) and formation of multi-beryllium species
would provide a foundation for addressing these issues of wide importance.
This letter takes an initial theoretical step in understanding the aggrega-
tion/disaggregation of beryllium clusters in water.

Early electronic structure calculations on beryllium hydration were performed
on small clusters [5,6] and some attempted to include the second hydration
shell in terms of the reaction ﬁeld approach [7] or explicitly [8]. Molecular
dynamics simulation [9] showed that assuming pair-wise intermolecular in-
teractions lead a hydration number was six (6) whereas including three-body
eﬀects brought the hydration number down to four (4) consistent with solution
X-ray diﬀraction experiments.

Be2+ hydration has also been considered within the Car-Parrinello approach
[10,11,12]. There a hexa-hydrate cluster quickly dissociated to give a tetra-
hydrate structure [10]. The ab initio molecular dynamics approach for a Be2+
atom in a box of 31 water molecules also showed that the ion was tetra-
hydrated [12]. That work also suggested an eﬀect of the second hydration
2+
shell water molecules on some of the bond lengths for the central Be(H2O)4
structure, noted further below.

Those earlier works have addressed important issues about Be2+ solvation,
but the thermodynamical aspect of solvation has not been considered specif-
ically. We address the solvation thermodynamics by employing two distinct

2

theoretical approaches. We study the solvation structure of Be2+ using ab
initio molecular dynamics methods and conﬁrm a stable tetra-coordination.
The quasi-chemical theory of solutions then provides a further analysis why
the tetra-hydrate is the most stable species. This approach has been used be-
fore to address Fe3+(aq) speciation [13], and the hydration of H+ [14], HO−
[15], Li+ [16], and Na+ [17] ions. As mentioned above, beryllium solution
chemistry holds the particular challenge of the formation of multi-beryllium
2+ deprotonation and on formation
clusters. The present studies on Be(H2O)4
of [Be · OH · Be]3+ provide ﬁrst steps in describing that aggregation process on
a molecular basis, as suggested by Fig. 1.

2 Ab initio molecular dynamics

The ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations were performed with
the VASP program [18,19]. The simulation system comprises 32 water molecules
and one Be2+ ion. The box length was set to 9.71 ˚A based on the experimental
partial molar volume of Be in water [20]. Vanderbilt ultrasoft pseudopotentials
[21,22] were used to describe the core-valence interactions for all the atoms.
The valence orbitals were expanded in plane waves with a kinetic energy cut-
oﬀ of 29.1 Ry. All the hydrogen atoms were replaced by deuterium and an
integration timestep of 0.5 fs was chosen.

The initial conﬁguration was obtained by placing a Be2+ ion in a bath of
water molecules. That conﬁguration was energy minimized before initiating
the AIMD simulations. At the end of the classical energy minimization, the
Be2+ ion was found to be penta-hydrated (based on R(BeO) ≤ 2.5 ˚A). In an
exploratory AIMD run (data not reported), the initial conﬁguration for the
AIMD simulation was obtained from a classical molecular dynamics simula-
tion. In that case the ion was hexa-hydrated, but it too quickly reverted to
the tetra-hydrated form.

In the ﬁrst 1.0 ps of the AIMD simulation the temperature was maintained
at 300 K by scaling the velocities. After this initial phase, a microcanonical
(NVE) ensemble simulation was performed for about 2.5 ps.

Within the ﬁrst 160 fs of the ca. 3.5 ps of the AIMD simulation, the coordina-
tion number changed to four (4) and stayed so for the rest of the simulation.
The energy in the NVE simulation was -472.25±0.08 (2σ) eV, suggesting good
energy conservation. The mean temperature was 316.2±21.6 K.

Fig. 2 shows the oxygen(water) radial distribution around the beryllium ion.

shell has a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the OH bond length of the inner shell water
molecule. In the present case, we do ﬁnd a slight lengthening of the OH bond
in the inner-shell water, but the statistical uncertainties here and in the earlier
study [12], suggest that the diﬀerence between the inner-shell and outer-shell
water is subtle. The increase in the HOH angle for the inner shell water is
similar to the earlier study [12] and is in line with the values obtained for an
2+ cluster. Also notice that the oxygen atoms in the inner-
isolated Be(H2O)4
shell are nearly tetrahedrally distributed around the central Be2+ ion, but that
structure does ﬂuctuate somewhat.

3 Quasi-chemical Theory

In the quasi-chemical theory [23], the region around the solute of interest is
partitioned into inner and outer shell domains. In the present study, the inner
shell, where chemical eﬀects are important, is treated quantum mechanically.
The outer shell contributions have been assessed using a dielectric continuum
model. In principle, a variational check of this partition is available (see [17]).

Hydration state of Be2+: The inner shell reactions pertinent to Be2+ hy-
dration are:

Be2+ + nH2O ⇀↽ Be(H2O)n

2+

The free energy change for these reactions were calculated using the Gaussian
programs [24]. The Be · (H2O)n
2+ (n = 0. . .6) clusters were geometry optimized
in the gas phase using the B3LYP hybrid density functional[25] and the 6-
31+G(d,p) basis set. Frequency calculations conﬁrmed a true minimum, and
the zero point energies were computed at the same level of theory. Single point
energies were calculated using the 6-311+G(2d,p) basis set. A purely inner-
shell n = 5 cluster could not be obtained; the optimization gave structures
with four (4) inner and one (1) outer sphere water molecule. For n = 6 both a
purely inner-shell conﬁguration, and a structure with four (4) inner and two
(2) outer shell water molecules were obtained. The quasi-chemical theory here
utilizes only the inner-shell structure.

For estimating the outer shell electrostatic contribution, the ChelpG method
[26] was used to obtain partial atomic charges. Then with the radii set de-
veloped by Stefanovich et al.[27], surface tessera were generated [28], and the
solvation free energies of the clusters were calculated using a dielectric contin-
uum model [29]. With this information and the binding free energies for the
chemical reactions, a primitive quasi-chemical approximation to the excess
chemical potential of Be2+(aq) in water is:

tion number of the most stable inner shell cluster, and β = 1/kBT. The den-
sity factor ρH2O appearing in eq. 1 reﬂects the actual density of liquid wa-
ter and its eﬀect is accounted for by including a replacement contribution of
−nkBT ln(1354). A detailed statement on standard states and this replacement
contribution can be found in Grabowski et al. [14].

From ﬁgure 3 it is clear that the tetra-aquo cation is the most stable form in
solution. This is also consistent with the predictions of the AIMD simulations.
As ﬁg. 3 indicates, neglecting solvation eﬀects would have forced us to conclude
that both the tetra- and hexa-hydrates should be observed. However, it is the
substantial unfavorable solvation of the hexa-hydrate that precludes its pres-
ence in the solvent. The calculated solvation free energy of -567.7 kcal/mole is
in the right range and is in good agreement with the value (-574.6 kcal/mole)
cited in [20]. Solvation free energy values for these highly charged species may
have signiﬁcant uncertainties, and the agreement here should not mask the real
diﬃculties facing ion-solvation thermodynamics. The agreement in inner-shell
hydration number between AIMD simulations and quasi-chemical calculations
is, however, a non-trivial result.

In table 2 some of the energies relevant to the n = 4 case above is collected in
addition to other free energy values that we will use in analyzing the pKa of
the tetra-aquo cluster.

quires us to know the hydration free energy of the proton, estimates of which
have large uncertainties [14]. Alternatively, using a reference reaction such as
the dissociation of water can obviate the need for knowing the proton hydra-
tion free energy. Thus consider

Be(H2O)4

2+ + HO− ⇀↽ BeOH(H2O)3

+ + H2O

Knowing the energetics of eq. 4 permits calculation of the pKa of the tetra-
aquo cation, according to

Ka = K × (Kw/ [H2O]) .

Here K is the equilibrium ratio of eq. 4 with all concentration units the same,
Kw = [HO−] [H+] the standard ion product for water; here pKw = 15.7 [30].
An added advantage of using a reference reaction as above is that some can-
cellation of errors can be encouraged.

The excess chemical potential of HO−(aq) in reaction 4 above is also ob-
tained within the quasi-chemical approach and with the tri-hydrated quasi-
component [15]. The computed value of -105 kcal/mole is in good agreement
with recently reported values [31].

If all standard concentrations are 1 M, then using the values in table 2 the
free energy change for reaction 4 is -18.5 kcal/mole. Eq. 5 then yields pKa ≈
3.8.

By ﬁtting experimental free energy changes for the case of low total Be2+
2+ exists in appreciable amounts
concentration [1,4], it is found that Be(H2O)4
only below a pH of 3.5. The present calculated pKa is in excellant agreement
with these observations. This value of pKa has the standard interpretation
+ is above a thousand times more
that the deprotonated complex BeOH(H2O)3
2+ at neutral pH. That a spontaneous deprotonation
probable than Be(H2O)4
is not observed in our simulations is reﬂective of the limited simulation time
and the possibility of this process being activated. Nevertheless, when an OH−
was introduced into the AIMD simulation by extraction of a proton distant
from the beryllium ion, ligand exchange by proton shuﬄing was accomplished
in less than a ps.

Formation of [Be · OH · Be]3+: The [Be · OH · Be]3+ cluster is one of the
many clusters that beryllium forms [1], but it is the simplest. Other clus-
ters could be constructed with this unit. Thus understanding the formation
thermodynamics of this cluster is of ﬁrst interest.

The solvation free energy of the complex [Be · OH · Be]3+ is obtained from the
following reaction.

Be · OH · Be3+ + 6H2O ⇀↽ Be · OH · Be · (H2O)6

3+

(6)

Here is is assumed that each of the originally tetra-hydrated Be2+ loses one
water and gains a HO− to form the complex (ﬁg. 1). Using eq. 1 for the present
case, the quasi-chemical estimate of the solvation free energy of [Be·OH·Be]3+
is obtained as -834.5 kcal/mole.

With this solvation free energy estimate, we can enquire about the thermody-
namics of the complexation reaction below.

2Be2+ + HO− ⇀↽ [Be · OH · Be]3+

(7)

The change in the excess chemical potential for the reaction is 405.9 kcal/mole,
whereas the ideal contribution i.e., for an the ideal gas at 1 atm pressure,
is -424.2 kcal/mole for this change. This gives the net free energy change
of -18.3 kcal/mole not accounting for standard concentration. Converting to
the standard concentration of 1 M adjusts this by −2 · RT ln 24.46 to the
calculated free energy change of -22.1 kcal/mole.

An experimental value for the complexation reaction is -14.4 kcal/mole[1,4].
The calculated energetics are in the right range, but the agreement is only fair.
Note also that a small diﬀerence between large numbers is being computed;
thus even minor errors will tend to get ampliﬁed. A physical conclusion is that
the hydration contribution is more 20 times larger than the net standard free
energy change for this reaction; neglecting hydration eﬀects would lead to a

8

qualitatively incorrect result. Below we consider ways to improve upon these
initial estimates.

4 Concluding Discussions

The quasi-chemical approach leads to free energies that are in reasonable
agreement with available experimental estimates. But this agreement should
not obscure the severe approximations that have been made in applying the
theory to practical calculations. For divalent cations, it is unclear if purely a
inner-shell complex would provide adequate accuracy of solvation free energy
estimate. There are potentially two possible avenues for improvement which
we indicate below.

First, the outer-sphere hydration contributions can be obtained using classical
molecular mechanics approaches instead of the dielectric continuum model
used above. Such an approach is now being undertaken for water clusters on
monovalent cations (Asthagiri, et al. in preparation) and this can likely be
used for Be(H2O)4

2+ as well.

Second, it is possible to expand the chemical potential of the tetra-aqua cation
in terms of its own inner-shell (i.e. the Be2+ cation’s 2nd shell). This seems par-
ticularly natural here because the inner shell structures are physically deﬁnite
(ﬁg. 2). The hydration contribution of those 2nd shell structures could be ob-
tained using a dielectric continuum model. Also it is possible to apply a lower
level of quantum chemical approximation to describe the coupling of the 1st
and 2nd shells. Then with an improved estimate for the solvation free energy
of the tetra-aqua cation, one could obtain a better estimate for the solva-
tion free energy of Be2+. This approach is the iterated quasi-chemical scheme
and a variant has been successfully applied to hard-sphere ﬂuids [32]. In the
present case, however, this approach would be daunting for many reasons. (A)
Obtaining statistically representative 2nd-shell complexes in the gas-phase is
diﬃcult. (B) The rigid-rotor harmonic oscillator approximation is dubious for
applications to such clusters. (C) Applying the quasi-chemical theory to such
large clusters demands consideration of packing eﬀects. This latter issue is
actively under study at present (Ashbaugh and Pratt, in preparation).

The neglect of packing aspect is certainly one the reason underlying the
merely fair agreement for the [Be · OH · Be]3+ thermochemistry. It is also likely
that anharmonic eﬀects are non-negligible for clusters such as Be2OH3+ and
3+. But despite these substantial limitations, it is heartening to
Be2OH(H2O)6
obtain the qualitatively correct trends. In our pKa calculations, however, by
arranging the equation to have similarly sized species on both sides of the
equality we were able to mitigate these uncertainties.

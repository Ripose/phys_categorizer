Abstract

While the theory of chemical bonding has advanced rapidly as
more and more details of the quantum mechanical problem have been
taken into account, surprisingly little eﬀort has gone into the devel-
opement of intuitive models to interpret the results obtained by more
sophisticated means.
This article introduces an approach to chemical bonding, which should
give a better connection between basic quantum mechanics and the
covalent pair bond, focussing on the fact that, while the size of atoms
and therefore the bond length are determined by an equilibrium be-
tween Coulomb attraction and the quantum incompressibility of the
electrons, the energy of the bond is largely given by the electron ki-
netic energy term. This is well established in solid state physics, where
the tight binding parameters for a large class of materials can be de-
rived from the free electron dispersion relation. However, a similar
argument can be made for small molecules if the electron density of
the molecule is roughly similar to the atomic densities. It is shown
that such an approach yields not only the energy of the bond but
also a bonding potential as a function of bond length, which allows an
estimate of vibrational frequencies for the molecule.

1 Introduction

The theory of electronic structure is usually introduced quite diﬀerently to
chemists (for example [1]) and to physisists (for example [2]). While the for-
mer begin with energetic considerations in small molecules, the latter tend
to focus on dynamics and solid state systems. Yet, the nature of the bonds
is quite similar in solids and in molecules, and a lot can be learned by exam-
ining common features.
In 1979, Froyen and Harrison [3] showed, that the parameters for the LCAO
or tight binding approach to the band structure of tetrahedrally bound solids
such as Diamond, Silicon and Germanium can be derived from a comparison
with free electrons. Consequently, the matrix elements of the bonding over-
lap depend only on the kinetic energy. The potential energy enters through
the separation of the atomic energy levels and through the bond length, both
of which are features of the atomic wavefunction.
It is therefore possible to explain bonding between atoms using only the con-
tribution of the kinetic energy to the bond formation, while the Coulomb
energy is responsible for tightly binding the electrons to the atoms. This
qualitative diﬀerence between the formation of atomic orbitals and that of
molecular bonds is crucial for understanding the physics of the chemical bond.

2 Properties of the Atomic System

Electrons are fermions. They obey the Pauli principle and therefore resist
compression even if we neglect the Coulomb repulsion. In fact, for high den-
sities, the Pauli principle turns out to be a stronger force of repulsion than
the Coulomb forces. Since two electrons in the same Volume of space need to
have diﬀerent momentum, the average kinetic energy increases with electron
density. The correct quantitative expression can be derived using only the
rule that, in a phase space volume of h3, there is room for no more than 2
electrons:

EP auli =

h2
2m

ρ2/3

(1)

where m is the electron mass and ρ is the electron density.
This term, which increases with decreasing distance as r−2, prevents the
Coulomb attraction, which increases only with r−1, from pulling the electrons
into the atomic nuclei. Note that electron-electron repulsion simply weakens
the net eﬀect of the attraction of the positive charge. Since the power law is
the same, however, the total eﬀect of the Coulomb forces is similar, whether
we look at the many particle problem or just at a hydrogen atom.

In the atom, the electrons are compressed by the coulomb attraction until the
repulsion caused by the Pauli principle compensates this force. The length
scale at which this happens is, of course, the atomic length scale of the Bohr
radius a0.

To get an idea of the preassure which the Pauli principle creates in an atom,
one can divide the Pauli Energy corresponding to one electron per atomic
volume by this same Volume. Using a Volume of 4/3πa3
0, the result is ap-
proximately 1010P a or 100000 times atmospheric preassure. To get an idea
of how ”solid” the atom actually is, we can estimate the compressibility of
the atom by taking the volume derivative of the sum of Pauli and Coulomb
energy. Not surprisingly, the result is equivalent to simply dividing by the
Volume. We therefore arrive at a compressibility of χ = 10−10P a−1. This is
exactly the order of magnitude found in the elastic constants of solid materi-
10−11P a−1. Most liquids
als, from lead at 0.6
have compressibilities which are 5 to 20 times lower, water being at the lower
end, having a compressibility of 0.5
×
This is well in tune with the quite intuitive picture of solids consisting of
densly packed atoms. However, while it is quite suﬃcient to invoke the Pauli
preassure to explain what keeps matter apart and why a hard sphere model
is quite an adequate picture for the atom despite the notion of emptyness
associated with the assumed ”sizes” of electrons and nuclei, we need to have
a closer look at the electronic system in order to understand the forces that
hold atoms together.

3 Unpaired electrons

Since electrons are particles with spin 1/2 and can therefore occupy two spin
states for every real space state, the Pauli preassure seems to act seperately
on two types of electrons. If the electron gas were continuous and did not
consist of quantized particles, the spin up density would thus always equal
the spin down density, and all matter would be paramagnetic. Indeed, this
type of paramagnetism exists in some metals and is consequently known as
Pauli paramagnetism [2].
However, since there are a discrete number of electrons in a discrete number
of states, it may happen that n degenerate states are ﬁlled with less than
2n electrons. In this case, the Pauli preassure is insensitive to the distribu-
tion of the electrons. Indeed, if all unpaired electrons align their spins, the
Pauli principle keeps them spatially separate, reducing the electron-electron
Coulomb repulsion, while electrons with opposite spins would overlap more
strongly, even if in separate real space states. This energy is the spin exchange
energy calculated in Hartree-Fock theory. If we have a high degeneracy of
states partially ﬁlled, we therefore have a ground state with all unpaired spins
parallel. This is the reason for both Hund‘s ﬁrst rule and for ferromagnetism.
Energetically, the unpaired electrons are always somewhat unstable, as are
all systems with a degenerate ground state, since any small perturbation will
remove the degeneracy and break the symmetry of the system by forming
new geometric patterns. In surface science, this tendency for forming bonds
is often referred to as Jahn-Teller instabitity [4]. Although the change in ge-
ometry is not as impressive in the liquid or gas phase, the reactivity of atoms
with partially ﬁlled shells is a consequence of an instability of the same type.
The eﬀect which causes the perturbation when another similar atom ap-
proaches is not, however, the electric ﬁeld, although van-der-Waals forces
will be present. Instead, homopolar bond formation is largely the eﬀect of
kinetic energy, as the nearly free electron bands in solid state physics, which
are found even in non-metallic systems, suggest. We will therefore neglect
van-der-Waals forces and determine the eﬀect of kinetic energy only.
This can also be justiﬁed by examining the Hamiltonian of the two atom
system:

ˆH = ˆT + ˆV1 + ˆV2 + ˆVel−el

(4)

4

ˆT is the kinetic energy of the electrons, ˆV1/2 is the potential of the respec-
tive atom, and ˆVel−el is the electron-electron interaction. Considering, that
due to a negligible overlap of the electron distribution the Coulomb energies,
including electron-electron interactions, act almost exclusively on wavefunc-
tions localized at the respective atoms, this Hamiltonian may be seperated
into atomic Hamiltonians, each acting only on one of the atoms:

ˆH1 = ˆT + ˆV1 + ˆVel−el,1

(5)

ˆT

(7)

(6)

ˆH2 = ˆT + ˆV2 + ˆVel−el,2
ˆH = ˆH1 + ˆH2 −
Of course, we have thus neglected all electron-electron interactions between
electrons located at diﬀerent atoms, as well as interactions between the
atomic nucleus and electrons at the other nucleus. For well separated atoms,
the net eﬀect of these interactions are the van-der-Waals forces we have there-
fore neglected. We have further neglected the energy necessary to ionize the
atoms. This is possible, because the homopolar bonds have a symmetric
charge distribution. In polar bonds, this term must be considered in more
detail.
Note, that the kinetic energy term responsible for the bond formation is gen-
erated because the kinetic energy is included in both atomic Hamiltonians,
and must therefore be subtracted once from the total. This indicates the
fact, that the kinetic energy is not localized at one of the atoms, but causes
a delocalization connecting the two atoms.

ferent atoms,

4 Bonding and anti-bonding states

Asuming the electronic wavefunctions ψ1 and ψ2 to remain unchanged, we
can now calculate the energies of the bonding and anti-bonding states by cal-
culating the expectation values of the kinetic energy for the possible linear
combinations. Assuming a homopolar bond, the bonding and anti-bonding
states should be the sum and the diﬀerence of the atomic wavefunctions,
which are automatically orthogonal, if the atomic wavefunctions are normal-
ized states.

As the unpaired electrons approach each other, they can redistribute into
the two bonding and two anti-bonding levels. If they pair up in the bonding
level, a pair bond is formed.
Although these real space integrals already describe the eﬀect of wavefunction
overlap on the kinetic energy completely, it is quite revealing to take a look
at the same equations in k space by fourier transforming the whole integral,
which represents a convolution of two gradients.
In k space, this changes
into the integral of the product of the wavefunctions multiplied by k2 and a
cosine which represents the eﬀect of the real space separation:

(13)

If ψ1 = ψ2, the kinetic energy contributions of the overlapping wavefunctions
can be written in an even more compact form:

±
cos(kd)))d3k

R

(15)

In this case, the kinetic energy distribution is therefore modiﬁed by a factor of
cos(kd) at each point in k space. If the width of the impulse distribution
1
±
of the wavefunctions, that is, the width in k space of ψ∗ψ, is roughly equal
to π/d, then the contributions with the highest k2 values at the edge of the
distribution are suppressed by a multiplication with values close to 0 for the
bonding state. The kinetic energy of the bond is therefore at a minimum.
If the k space width of the atomic wavefunctions is much larger than π/d,
the rapid oscillations of the cosine make all overlap contributions cancel (as
they should, since the atoms are far apart in real space now).
If the k
space width is much smaller than π/d, all parts of the k-space distribution
contribute equally and the bonding state is again equivalent to the atomic
wavefunction. [5]
The k space distribution of the atomic wavefunction therefore deﬁnes a bond
length of roughly π divided by its width in k-space, at which the average
wavelength of the electron is in resonance with the bond length. Since the
k-space width is connected with the real space width by the uncertainty
relation, this bond length is roughly equal to the sum of the atomic radii,
so the covalent bond is actually strongest when the atoms just about touch
each other.
To understand the signiﬁcance of this result, it should be remembered, that
the potential energy eﬀects only enter the picture indirectly, by forming the
atomic wavefunctions. The formation of the chemical bond can then be
explained entirely by the change of kinetic energy when unpaired electrons
begin to tunnel resonantly between the atoms. While the total electron

7

density in real space changes only little, the kinetic energy distribution looses
a major part of its high energy contributions.

5 A quantitative example: Gaussian wave-

functions

As an analytically solvable example, Gaussian wavefunctions oﬀer a good
insight into the formation of bonds by kinetic energy resonance. The most
simple bond is a symmetric combination of s-type states:

Since the Fouriertransform of the Gaussian is again a Gaussian, it is easily
possible to determine all features of the resulting bond between two unpaired
electrons in such atomic states.

Note that the factor of three is a consequence of the three spatial dimen-

Gaussian wavefunctions, we could as well examine only the one dimensional
problem. However, we shall include the constant energy contributions for the
sake of completeness.

Figure 1 shows the energy and the k-space distribution of the bonding state
as a function of d and ﬁgure 2 shows the same for the anti-bonding state.
We can now determine the bond length, as well as the harmonic part of
the potential around it. This should allow an estimate of typical molecular
vibrations.
The minimum of the bonding potential is at d = 3.2σ. This corresponds very
well with the estimate given in the previous section, that the bond length
should be roughly equal to π divided by the width of the distribution in
k-space. The standard deviation of the k-space distribution is 1/2σ, so 1/σ
is a good measure of its width.
Around the minimum at d = 3.2σ, the bonding potential may be written as

The total energy is then given by Z times this potential, where Z is the
number of electrons in the bond. From this potential, the following relations

bonding energy and the elastic constant. Data for the elastic constant was
taken from [6] and all other data from [1]. The table also shows the σ values
that would correspond to the respective bond properties if the wavefunctions
were simple Gaussians. Although there are strong deviations even between
diﬀerent properties of the same molecule, the order of magnitude is repro-
duced even for this simple model.
To simulate a directional bond, we can calculate the bonding potential for

Note, that the separation between the two atoms, d, need not be along the
x axis.
It is possible to calculate the potential for the additive and the

This equation describes a potential with two minima along the x axis, at

of a ppσ bond, since there is rotational symmetry around the x-axis. In the

The bond is therefore softer against shear forces than against compression by
a factor of about 2.5. This example shows how the geometrical structure of
molecules and their vibrations can be described using only the kinetic energy
and the symmetry of atomic wavefunctions. Of course, a more comprehen-
sive description of molecules or crystals would require the full calculation of
matrix elements between all the atomic wavefunctions involved, using more
realistic wavefunctions than the Gaussians presented here.

6 The ionic contribution: extending the model

to polar bonds

The kinetic energy only dominates the homopolar bond. In the case of het-
eropolar bonds, there will be an energy diﬀerence between the electronic
states at atom A and at atom B, which pulls the electron towards the more
electronegative one.
In a very simpleminded tight binding approach, this
eﬀect may be included as a site dependensd energy in a tight binding ap-
EB = 2D, the two by two matrix of the polar bond is
proach. With EA −
then given by

T+ D
D T− !

 

(32)

T± is the kinetic energy of the bonding and anti-bonding states. For large
separations d, this is an unrealistic approach, however, since it neglects the
energy needed to ionize the atoms and therefore predicts complete ionization
as d approaches inﬁnity, not including the Coulomb attraction.
The other extreme is to assume fully polarized atoms. In this case, a term
representing the Pauli repulsion is necessary to keep the ions apart. This
may be done by adding the bonding and anti-bonding energies for the ﬁlled
outer shells of the ions.
To combine covalent and ionic eﬀects into a model of the polar bond, it is
necessary to consider a total of three possible electronic conﬁgurations: state
1, with both electrons at atom A, state 2 with one electron at each atom,
and state 3 with both electrons at atom B. Note that this corresponds to a

For VA = +D and VB =
However, by including the ionization energy in the VA/B, we can now correct
the result for large d. For very large d, VA/B is equal to the total ionization
energies VA/B(
) required to remove an electron from one atom and add it
to the other. V then follows the Coulomb law until the atoms come quite
close, when the atomic wavefunctions start to penetrate each other. At very
small distances, the diﬀerence in energy is given by the energy level diﬀerence
EB). The transition from the
of the atomic wavefunctions, D = 1/2(EA −

The length dA/B deﬁnes the length scale at which the transition between
covalent and polar bonding occurs. Since this length is largely determined
by the atomic size, it is typically close to the bond length. Still, the eﬀect of
VA/B(
) can often be ignored, since the eﬀects of the energy level diﬀerence
and the covalent bond combined tend to be stronger at atomic separations
equal to the bond length.

7 Conclusions

While many textbook explanations of chemical bonds try to visualize the
bond only in its spacial distribution, misleadingly suggesting that the source
of the bond energy could be the slight increase in electron density between
the atoms, the approach presented here clearly identiﬁes the kinetic energy
In the

spirit of the tight binding approximation, one can consider the atomic con-
ﬁnement of the electrons as much stronger than the interatomic interactions,
and thereby arrive at a bonding potential by simply calculating the expecta-
tion values of the kinetic energy for electron pairs evenly distributed between
the atoms. This type of bonding potential, which uses only the unchanged
atomic wavefunction and the fundamental kinetic energy term of free elec-
trons, not only gives the right order of magnitude for the bond energy, but
also reproduces the spatial potential of the bond, with realistic results for
bond length and bond elasticity.
Although a quantitatively accurate calculation may only be achieved by in-
cluding a more detailed description of polar eﬀects than discussed here, it
should be pointed out once more, that purely kinetic matrix elements do
give highly accurate results in semiconductors and other simple crystals.
Furthermore, the free electron behaviour of electrons in metals and the rela-
tion between covalent and metallic bonds may be understood better in the
light of these considerations. In fact, the major diﬀerence between the two
type of bonds is not the mechanism of bonding itself, but rather concerns
the fact that metallic bonds are not directed as are bonds involving p type
wavefunctions. Instead they couple equally well to all neighbours, resulting
in the strong delocalization of electrons which makes metals conductors and
in the relatively high plasticity compared with the brittle covalent bonds of
e.g. semiconductors.
In this manner, it is possible to ﬁnd numerous connections between the very
fundamental laws of quantum physics and the chemical and physical proper-
ties of the world surrouinding us. Indeed, it is an important fact to remember
as technology advances, that science not only tells us how to do things, but
also, why things are as they are, even though this often teaches us more
about limitations than about possibilities. Even the best artiﬁcial materials
will not be orders of magnitudes removed from the typical properties dictated
by constants such as ¯h and e, just as no signal will ever travel faster than
the speed of light. However, knowledge of our limitations may often proof
more important than know-how, and in this sense, simpliﬁed models as the
one presented here can proof to be extremely useful.

Table 1 shows the properties of some biatomic molecules, together with the
value of σ which would reproduce this property using Gaussian wavefunc-
tions.

Figure 1:

Figure 1a) shows the change in kinetic energy as a function of bond length
for the bonding state. The interatomic distance d is given in units of 2σ and
the energy diﬀerence from the unbound state is given in units of ¯h/4mσ2.
Figure 1b) shows the corresponding k-space distributions
plot. the momentum ¯hk is given in units of ¯h/σ.
The minimum in bond energy occurs when the k-space distribution is most
narrow, just before the side maxima appear.

Figure 2:

Figure 2a) shows the change in kinetic energy for the anti-bonding state. all
units are as in Figure 1.
For the anti-bonding state, the k-space distribution shows two peaks at small
distances d. It is therefore much wider than the bonding state distribution.
As d increases, it narrows, even though side maxima appear.

Figure 3:

Figure 3 shows the bonding potential of the ppσ bond calculated for the p
symmetry Gaussian wavefunctions in the xy plane. The unit of length is 2σ.

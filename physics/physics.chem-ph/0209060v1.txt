We investigate the inﬂuence of external laser excitations on the average current through bridged
molecules. For the computation of the current, we use a numerically very eﬃcient formalism that
is based on the Floquet solutions of the time-dependent molecule Hamiltonian. It is found that the
current as a function of the laser frequency exhibits characteristic peaks originating from resonant
excitations of electrons to bridge levels which are unoccupied in the absence of the radiation. The
electrical current through the molecule can exhibit a drastic enhancement by several orders of
magnitude.

INTRODUCTION

In a seminal work,1 Aviram and Ratner proposed almost thirty years ago to build elements of electronic circuits
— in their case a rectiﬁer — with single molecules. In the present days their vision starts to become reality and
the experimental and theoretical study of such systems enjoys a vivid activity.2,3,4 Recent experimental progress has
enabled reproducible measurements5,6 of weak tunneling currents through molecules which are coupled by chemisorbed
thiol groups to the gold surface of external leads. A necessary ingredient for future technological applications will be
the possibility to control the tunneling current through the molecule.

Typical energy scales in molecules are in the optical and the infrared regime, where basically all of the today’s
lasers operate. Hence, lasers represent a natural possibility to control atoms or molecules and also currents through
them. It is for example possible to induce by the laser ﬁeld an oscillating current in the molecule which under certain
asymmetry conditions is rectiﬁed by the molecule resulting in a directed electron transport even in the absence of any
applied voltage.7,8 Another theoretically predicted eﬀect is the current suppression by the laser ﬁeld9 which oﬀers the
possibility to control and switch the electron transport by light. Since the considered frequencies lie below typical
plasma frequencies of metals, the laser light will be reﬂected at the metal surface, i.e. it does not penetrate the leads.
Consequently, we do not expect major changes of the leads’ bulk properties — in particular each lead remains close
to equilibrium. Thus, to a good approximation, it is suﬃcient to consider the inﬂuence of the driving solely in the
molecule Hamiltonian. In addition, the energy of infrared light quanta is by far smaller than the work function of a
common metal, which is of the order of 5 eV. This prevents the generation of a photo current, which otherwise would
dominate the eﬀects discussed below.

Recent theoretical descriptions of the molecular conductivity in non-driven situations are based on a scattering
approach,10,11 or assume that the underlying transport mechanism is an electron transfer reaction from the donor
to the acceptor site and that the conductivity can be derived from the corresponding reaction rates.3 It has been
demonstrated that both approaches yield essentially identical results in a large parameter regime.12 Within a high-
temperature limit, the electron transport on the wire can be described by inelastic hopping events.13,14

Atoms and molecules in strong oscillating ﬁelds have been widely studied within a Floquet formalism.15,16 This
suggests utilizing the tools that have been acquired in that area, thus, developing a transport formalism that combines
Floquet theory for a driven molecule with the many-particle description of transport through a system that is coupled
to ideal leads.7,8,9 Such an approach is devised much in the spirit of the Floquet-Markov theory17,18 for driven
dissipative quantum systems.

II. FLOQUET TREATMENT OF THE ELECTRON TRANSPORT

The entire system of the wire in the laser-ﬁeld, the leads, and the molecule-lead coupling as sketched in Figure 1 is

A. Perturbation theory

While the leads and the wire, including the driving, will be treated exactly, we take the wire-lead Hamiltonian as a
perturbation into account. Starting from the Liouville-von Neumann equation i¯h ˙̺(t) = [H(t), ̺(t)] together with the
factorizing initial condition ̺(t0) = ̺wire(t0)
̺leads,eq, we derive by standard techniques an approximate equation of
motion for the total density operator ̺(t). This is most conveniently achieved in the interaction picture with respect
to the uncoupled dynamics where the Liouville-von Neumann equation reads

we are mainly interested in the behavior of the molecule and not in the details of the lead-wire coupling, we assume
that the conduction band width of the leads is much larger than all remaining relevant energy scales. Consequently,
we approximate in the so-called wide-band limit the functions ΓL/R(ǫ) by the constant values ΓL/R. After some

can be reduced to a single “Brillouin zone”
ǫ < ¯hΩ/2. In turn, all physical quantities that are computed
within a Floquet formalism are independent of the choice of a speciﬁc class member. Thus, a consistent description

follows from the mutual orthogonality and the completeness of the Floquet states at equal times.16,22 Note that the
right-hand side of Eq. (21) becomes t-independent after the summation. The operators cα(t) are constructed in such
a way that the time-dependences of the interaction picture operators ˜cα(t

crucial for the further analysis. Indeed, one can easily verify the relation

The Fourier decomposition in the last line is possible because all Rαβ(t) are expectation values of a linear, dissipative,
periodically driven system and therefore share in the long-time limit the time-periodicity of the driving ﬁeld. In the
subspace of a single electron, Rαβ reduces to the density matrix in the basis of the Floquet states which has been
used to describe dissipative driven quantum systems in Refs. 16,18,23,24,25,26.

The next step towards the stationary current is to ﬁnd the Fourier coeﬃcients Rαβ,k at asymptotic times. To this
end, we derive from the equation of motion (10) a master equation for Rαβ(t). Since all coeﬃcients of this master
equation, as well as its asymptotic solution, are
-periodic, we can split it into its Fourier components. Finally, we
obtain for the Rαβ,k the inhomogeneous set of equations

For a consistent Floquet description, the current formula together with the master equation must obey class invariance.
Indeed, the simultaneous transformation with (18) of both the master equation (29) and the current formula (26)
amounts to a mere shift of summation indices and, thus, leaves the current as a physical quantity unchanged.

For the typical parameter values used below, a large number of sidebands contributes signiﬁcantly to the Fourier
decomposition of the Floquet modes
. Numerical convergence for the solution of the master equation (29),
Φα(t)
i
|
however, is already obtained by just using a few sidebands for the decomposition of Rαβ(t). This keeps the numerical
eﬀort relatively small and justiﬁes a posteriori the use of the Floquet representation (21). Yet we are able to treat
the problem beyond the rotating-wave-approximation.

C. Time-averaged current through the molecular wire

Equation (25) implies that the current IL(t) obeys the time-periodicity of the driving ﬁeld. Since we consider here
excitations by a laser ﬁeld, the corresponding driving frequency lies in the optical or infrared spectral range. In an
experiment one will thus only be able to measure the time-average of the current. For the net current entering through
the left contact it is given by

Total charge conservation of the original wire-lead Hamiltonian (1) of course requires that the charge on the wire
can only change by current ﬂow, amounting to the continuity equation ˙Qwire(t) = IL(t) + IR(t). Since asymptotically,
˙Qwire(t)
the charge on the wire obeys at most the periodic time-dependence of the driving ﬁeld, the time-average of
must vanish in the long-time limit. From the continuity equation one then ﬁnds that ¯IL + ¯IR = 0, and we can
introduce the time-averaged current

This continuity equation can be obtained directly from the average current formula (30) together with the master
equation (29), as has been explicitly shown in Ref. 8.

III. LASER-ENHANCED CURRENT

A. Bridged molecular wire

As a working model we consider a molecule consisting of a donor and an acceptor site and N

2 sites in between
(cf. Fig. 1). Each of the N sites is coupled to its nearest neighbors by a hopping matrix elements ∆. The laser ﬁeld
renders each level oscillating in time with a position-dependent amplitude. Thus, the corresponding time-dependent
wire Hamiltonian reads

donor and the acceptor orbitals are assumed to be at the level of the chemical potentials of the attached leads,

In all numerical studies, we will use a symmetric coupling, ΓL = ΓR = Γ. The hopping matrix element ∆ serves
as the energy unit; in a realistic wire molecule, ∆ is of the order 0.1 eV. Thus, our chosen wire-lead hopping rate

B. Average current at resonant excitations

Let us ﬁrst discuss the static problem in the absence of the ﬁeld, i.e. for A = 0. In the present case where the
coupling between two neighboring sites is much weaker than the bridge energy, ∆

the driving ﬁeld, these bridge states mediate the super-exchange between the donor and the acceptor. This yields an

This behavior changes signiﬁcantly when a driving ﬁeld with a frequency Ω

EB/¯h is switched on. Then the
resonant bridge levels merge with the donor and the acceptor state to form a Floquet state. This opens a direct
channel for the transport resulting in an enhancement of the electron current as depicted in Figure 2 where we plot
the current ampliﬁcation, deﬁned as the ratio of the time-averaged current to the current in the absence of the laser,
η = ¯I/I0: In a wire with N = 8 sites, one ﬁnds peaks in the current when the driving frequency matches the energy
diﬀerence between the donor/acceptor doublet and one of the N
2 = 6 bridge levels. The applied voltage is always
chosen so small that the bridge levels lie below the chemical potentials of the leads. The ampliﬁcation, can assume
many orders of magnitude, cf. Figure 2. Generally, the response of a system to a weak resonant driving scales with the
damping and the driving amplitude. Figure 3 demonstrates this behavior for the peaks of the electrical current. The
peak heights at the maxima of the time-averaged current are found proportional to A2/Γ. A further scaling behavior is
found for the current peaks as a function of the wire length: The average current no longer exhibits the exponentially
decaying length dependence that has been found for bridged super-exchange. By contrast, it emerges proportional to

that it suggests a common envelope function. Put diﬀerently, the current is essentially inversely proportional to the
length as in the case of Ohmic conductance.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

We have presented a detailed derivation of the Floquet transport formalism which has been applied in Refs. 7,8,9.
The analysis of a bridged molecular wire revealed that resonant excitations from the levels that connect the molecule
to the external leads to bridge levels yield peaks in the current as a function of the driving frequency. In a regime
with weak driving and weak electron-lead coupling, ∆
Γ, A, the peak heights scale with the coupling strength,
≫
the driving amplitude, and the wire length. The laser irradiation induces a large current enhancement of several
orders of magnitude. The observation of these resonances could serve as an experimental starting point for the more
challenging attempt of measuring quantum ratchet eﬀects7,8 or current switching by laser ﬁelds.9

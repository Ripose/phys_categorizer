SPIN-LATTICE RELAXATION IN ZERO-MAGNETIC FIELD
INDUSED BY MOLECULAR REORIENTATIONS
M.I.Mazhitov, Yu.A.Serebrennikov

The stochastic Liouville method is used to analyze the general problem
of spin-lattice relaxation in zero-ﬁeld for molecules undergoing Markovian
reorientations.

I. Introduction
The resolution advantage of zero-ﬁeld (ZF) studies for orientationatty dis-
ordered materials is well known.
In particular, the novel-pulsed ZF NMR
and NQR technique [I,2] oﬀers an excellent approach to this problem since
it removes the orientational anisotropy which produces the broad high-ﬁeld
line shapes in solids. In ZF NMR and NOR the signal comes from longitu-
dinal nuclear magnetization, i.e. the rank-I statisiical tensor. Time-domain
ZF signals have also been observed using the method of perturbed angu-
lar correlations of γ-ray cascades [3]. From such experiments it is possible
to extract information concerning the zero-ﬁeld spin-lattice relaxation (ZF
SLR) of rank ≥ 2 statistical tensors. The corresponding response function
depends on the rates and microscopic details (in the slow-motional regime)
of molecular reorientations which modulate the antisotropic part of the spin
Hamiltonian.

Mathematical techniques have recently been developed which make anal-
yses of ZF NMR spectra in the complete tumbling regime feasible [4-6]. Our
purpose here is to extend this theory. We present a general formalism which
enables us to compute the response function of statistical tensors of arbitrary
rank-k irrespective of the models used to describe the Markovian molecular
reorientations. A compact expression for the correspondtng spectral function
is obtained, which is valid for the complete tumbling regime. To illustrate the
use of the theory we calculate the rank−2 perturbation coeﬃcient of γ-ray
cascades arising from the quadrupole interaction of a spin−1 nucleus with an
axially symmetric electric ﬁeld gradient. All the calculations in this paper are
conﬁned to situations that are macroscopically isotropic. There is continuity
with the formalism of the preceding articles [4-6] and intermediate results

derived there are assumed to have been looked at by the reader.

2. Theory
In ZF the spin Hamiltonian for the problem is

ˆH(Ω) =

(−1)p ˆF2pD2

q−p(Ω)A2q

q,p
X

Here ˆF2p is the p-component of a second-rank spin tensor operator in the
laboratory frame. A2q are components of a ZF splitting tenser expressed
in the molecular coordinate system(the principal axis frame) and D2
q−p(Ω)
are the Wigner rotation matrices describing the transformation between the
two frames. The explicit form of ˆF2p and A2q will depend on the type of
interaction.

For suﬃciently large molecules in dense media the stochastic reorienta-
tional process may be assumed to be Markovian. It then follows that an ap-
propriate ensemble average spin density operator ˆρ(Ω, t) obeys the stochastic
Liouville equation (SLE) [7,8]

∂ ˆρ(Ω, t)
∂t

= −iH x ˆρ(Ω, t) +

ˆˆLΩ ˆρ(Ω, t)

ˆˆLΩ is the stationary Markovian operator
where H x ˆρ = [ ˆH, ˆρ], ¯h = 1 and
describing the tumbling process. Eq.(2) must be solved with the initial con-
dition

ˆρ(Ω, 0) = φ(Ω)ˆρ(Ω) =

ˆρ(0)
8π2

which takes into account the fact that for isotropic systems there is an equi-
librium distribution of molecular orientations φ(Ω) = 1
8π2

The status of the spin ensemble can be discussed in terms of statistical

tensors ρ(kp)(i.e. state multipole moments )

where the coeﬃcient ρ(kp)(Ω, t) and the irreducible polarization operator ˆTkp(I)
[9] are given by

ˆρ(Ω, t) =

Here C Im

and spectral functions, Gkp(t) and ˜Gkp(s), are obtained as averages over the

where ˆD(Ω) is the ﬁnite rotation operator. Following refs. [4,10], we multiply
both sides of eq.(2) by ˆD(Ω) on the left and by (−1)p ˆD+(Ω)Dk
q−p(Ω) on the
right. In isotropic systems this procedure allows integration over Ω in the
general form as reported in ref. [10]. Through a straightforward extension of
the derivation described in ref. [10] we obtain a compact diﬀerential kinetic

Formally eq. (9) is similar to the impact equation which describes gas-phase
relaxation. Reorientations may be classiﬁed as either ”weak” or ”strong” de-
pending on the angular jump, with its size set by the function f (Ω). The new
formulation of the problem allows a solution irrespective of this circumstance
in the general form.

From that purpose let us re-express ˆσ(kp)

from the rest of the vector X and the problem reduces to the inversion of the

3. Discussion
In the fast motional limit, DQτθ2 ≪ 1 , taking into account (26)-(28) to

second order in perturbation theory, we have

G(kp)(s) = (s + λk)−1ρ(kp)(0), G(kp)(t) = exp[−λkt)ρ(kp)(0)

Eq.
[5](eq.(24)) which describes the
ZF NMR spectral function [1,2]. Ordinary NMR coils can only detect rank-1
tensors. However, by experimental observaiion of γ-ray cascades, it is possible
to extract information concerning the relaxation of k ≥ 2 statistical tensors.
In particular, the measurer anisotropy [3, 11, 12] is proportional to Gk0(t).
Sometimes it is convenient to observe the average correlation of all decays:

Gk0(∞) = τ −1

8π2 and τθ2 = τθ4 = τ . In contrast, τ −1

The spectral function (30) depends on τθ2 and τθ4. In the ”strong collision”
model f (Ω) = 1
θn = n(n + 1)Dr under
Debye orientational diﬀusion with coeﬃcient Dr. Thus in the slow tumbling
regime the precise form of the angular correlation depends on dynamical
details of the motion.

It is interesting to compare our exact result (30) with the approximate an-
alytical solution of the problem which has been obtained by Linden-Bell [12].
It is easy to see (by Laplace transformation of thc corresponding expressions
for G20(t) which have been given in ref.[12] that in the fast motional regime
our results coincide. However, her approximation is not suﬃcient to obtain
good quantitative agreement wich eq. (30) in the slow-motional limit, when
DQτθ2 ≃ 1.

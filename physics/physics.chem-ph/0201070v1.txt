(Dated: July 24, 2013)

We have used Monte-Carlo methods and analytical techniques to investigate the inﬂuence of the
characteristic parameters, such as pipe length, diﬀusion, adsorption, desorption and reaction rate
constants on the steady-state properties of Single-File Systems with a reaction. We looked at cases
when all the sites are reactive and when only some of them are reactive. Comparisons between
Mean-Field predictions and Monte Carlo simulations for the occupancy proﬁles and reactivity are
made. Substantial diﬀerences between Mean-Field and the simulations are found when rates of
diﬀusion are high. Mean-Field results only include Single-File behavior by changing the diﬀusion
rate constant, but it eﬀectively allows passing of particles. Reactivity converges to a limit value
if more reactive sites are added: sites in the middle of the system have little or no eﬀect on the
kinetics. Occupancy proﬁles show approximately exponential behavior from the ends to the middle
of the system.

INTRODUCTION

Molecular sieves are crystalline materials with open
framework structures. Of the almost two billion pounds
of molecular sieves produced in the last decade, 1.4 billion
pounds were used in detergents, 160 millions pounds as
catalysts and about 70 millions pounds as adsorbents or
desiccants. [1]

Zeolites represent a large fraction of known molecular
sieves. These are all aluminosilicates with well-deﬁned
pore structures. In these crystalline materials, the metal
atoms (classically, silicon or aluminum) are surrounded
by four oxygen anions to form an approximate tetrahe-
dron. These tetrahedra then stack in regular arrays such
that channels and cages are formed. The possible ways
for the stacking to occur is virtually unlimited, and hun-
dreds of unique structures are known. [2]

The channels (or pores) of zeolites generally have cross
section somewhat larger than a benzene molecule. Some
zeolites have one-dimensional channels parallel to one an-
other and no connecting cages large enough for guest
molecules to cross from one channel to the next. The
one-dimensional nature leads to extraordinary eﬀects on
the kinetic properties of these materials. Molecules move
in a concerted fashion, as they are unable to pass each
other in the channels. These structures are modeled
by one-dimensional systems called Single-File Systems
where particles are not able to pass each other. A par-

ticle can only move to an adjacent site if that site is not
occupied.

This process of Single-File diﬀusion has diﬀerent char-
acteristics than ordinary diﬀusion which aﬀects the na-
ture of both transport and conversion by chemical re-
actions. For Single-File diﬀusion, the mean-square dis-
placement of a particular particle is proportional to the
square-root of time

where F is the Single-File mobility. [3] This is in contrast
to normal diﬀusion, where mean-square displacement is
directly proportional to time. A variety of approaches
have been used to describe the movement of the particles
in Single-File Systems, most of them concentrated on the
role of the Single-File diﬀusion process.

Molecular Dynamic(MD) studies of diﬀusion in zeo-
lites have become increasingly popular with the advent of
powerful computers and improved algorithms. In a MD
simulation the movement is calculated by computing all
forces exerted upon the individual particles. MD results
have been found to match experimental observations of
Single-File diﬀusion for systems with one type of molecule
without conversion and with very short pores. [4, 5, 6, 7]
Because a molecule can move to the right or to the left
neighboring site only if this site is free, MD simulations
under heavy load circumstances require a high computa-
tional eﬀort for particles that hardly move. However, the
level of detail provided by MD simulations is not always
necessary.

Thus, deterministic models are used also but they
are mainly focused on dynamic and steady-state infor-
mation of short pore systems.
[8, 9, 10] Several re-
searchers [11, 12, 13] used a stochastic approach, i.e.,
Dynamic Monte Carlo(DMC), to determine the proper-
ties of Single-File Systems.
In DMC reactions can be
included. The rates of the reactions determine the prob-
ability with which diﬀerent conﬁgurations are generated
and how fast (at what moment in time) new conﬁgura-
tions are generated. The most severe limitation of the

DMC method arises when the reaction types in a model
can be partitioned into 2 classes with vastly diﬀerent re-
action rates. In this case, extremly large amounts of com-
puter time are required to simulate a reasonable number
of chemical reactions. However, in general the system
can be simulated for much longer times than with MD.
All the previous references put the emphasis on the
transport properties of adsorbed molecules as the impor-
tant factor in separation and reaction processes that take
place within zeolites and other shape-selective microp-
orous catalysts. R¨odenbeck and K¨arger [9] solved numer-
ically the principal dependence of steady-state properties
such as concentration proﬁles and the residence time dis-
tribution of the particles, on the system parameters for
suﬃciently short pores. In multiple papers, Auerbach et
al. [14, 15] used Dynamic Monte Carlo to show diﬀerent
predictions about Single-File transport and direct mea-
surements of intercage hopping ion strongly adsorbing
quest-zeolite systems. Saravanan and Auerbach [16, 17]
studied a lattice model of self-diﬀusion in nanopores, to
explore the inﬂuence of loading, temperature and adsor-
bate coupling on benzene self-diﬀusion in Na-X and Na-Y
zeolites. They applied Mean-Field(MF) approximation
for a wide set of parameters, and derived an analyti-
cal diﬀusion theory to calculate diﬀusion coeﬃcients for
various loadings at ﬁxed temperature, denoted as ”diﬀu-
sion isotherms”. They found that diﬀusion isotherms can
be segregated into subcritical and supercritical regimes,
depending upon the system temperature relative to the
critical temperature of the conﬁned ﬂuid. Supercriti-
cal systems exhibit three characteristic loading depen-
dencies of diﬀusion depending on the degree of degen-
eracy of the lattice while the subcritical diﬀusion sys-
tems are dominated by cluster formation. Coppens and
Bell [18, 19, 20] studied the inﬂuence of occupancy and
pore network topology on tracer and transport diﬀusion
in zeolites. They found that diﬀusion in zeolites strongly
depends on the pore network topology and on the types
and fractions of the diﬀerent adsorption sites. MF cal-
culations can quickly estimate the diﬀusivity, although
large deviations from the DMC values occur when long-
time correlations are present at higher occupancies, when
the site distribution is strongly heterogeneous and the
connectivity of the network low.

Few researchers included also reactivity in Single-File
Systems. Tsikoyannis and Wei [8] considered a reac-
tive one-dimensional system with all the sites reactive
in order to get more information about the reactivity
and selectivity in one-dimensional systems. They used a
Markov pure jump processes approach to model zeolitic
diﬀusion and reaction as a sequence of elementary jump
events taking place in a ﬁnite periodic lattice. Monte
Carlo and approximate analytical solutions to the de-
rived Master Equation were developed to examine the
eﬀect of intracrystalline occupancy on the macroscopic
diﬀusional behavior of the system. One conclusion was
that better results using analytical approach can be ob-
tained compared to DMC simulation results by including

more correlations between neighboring sites in regions of
the systems with high occupancy gradients and less cor-
relations in regions with low and no occupancy gradients.
Starting from Wei [8] results about correlations in Single-
File Systems, Okino and Snurr [10] used a deterministic
model where each site was assumed to have equal activ-
ity towards reaction. Doublet approximation was found
to overpredict the occupancy of the sites and the increas-
ing mobility raised the concentration of reactants in the
pore.

Using DMC simulations we have observed that even for
inﬁnitely fast diﬀusion, we still have Single-File eﬀects in
the system. Instead of focusing on diﬀusion at diﬀerent
occupancies of the system, we therefore concentrate in
this paper on the reactivity of the system, studying the
reactivity of the system for diﬀerent sets of kinetic pa-
rameters, the length of the pipe and the distribution of
the reactive sites. We analyse the situations when MF
gives good results and when MF results deviate strongly
from the DMC simulations. We investigate the eﬀect of
the various model assumptions made about diﬀusion, ad-
sorption/desorption, and reaction on the overall behav-
ior of the system. We look at the total loading, loading
with diﬀerent components, generation of reaction prod-
ucts and occupancies of individual sites as a function of
the various parameters of a Single-File System.

In section II we specify our mathematical model for
diﬀusion and reaction in zeolites together with the theo-
retical background for the analytical and simulation re-
sults. In section III A we present the various results for
the simpliﬁed model without conversion. In section III B
we use MF theory to solve the Master Equation govern-
ing the system behavior for the case when all the sites
have the same activity towards conversion. Similarly the
results obtained using DMC simulations are presented in
section III B 2 and are compared with MF results. We
pay special attention to the inﬁnitely fast diﬀusion case
and to the inﬂuence of the length of the pipe on the over-
all behavior of the system. In section III C we analyze
again the MF and simulation results but for the case
when only some of the sites are reactive. The inﬂuence
of the position and number of reactive sites on the reac-
tivity and site occupancy of the system is outlined. The
last section summarizes our main conclusions.

II. THEORY

In this section we will give the theoretical background
for our analytical and simulation results. First we will
specify our model and then we will show that the deﬁned
system obeys a Master Equation. [21] We will simulate
the system governed by this Master Equation using DMC
simulations. The rate equations used for the derivation
of the analytical results are outlined.

A. The Model

B. Master Equation

Because we are interested in reaction of molecules in
Single-File Systems, we call the system we are modelling,
Single-File System with conversion. We model a Single-
File System by a one-dimensional array of sites, each
possibly occupied by a single adsorbate. The sites are
numbered 1, 2, . . . , S. An adsorbate can only move if
an adjacent site is unoccupied. The sites could be reac-
tive or unreactive and we note with Nreac the number of
reactive sites. A reactive site is the only place where a
reaction may take place.

We consider two types of adsorbates, A and B,
in
our model and we denote with X the site occupation
of a site, X=(
, A, B), which stands for an empty
∗
site, a site occupied by A, or a site occupied by a B,
respectively. The sites at the ends of the system are
labeled with m, and the reactive sites are labeled with
r (see ﬁgure 1). We restrict ourselves to the following
mono and bi-molecular transitions.

a) Adsorption and desorption

Reaction kinetics is described by a stochastic process.
Every reaction has a microscopic rate constant associated
with it that is the probability per unit time that the
reaction occurs. Stochastic models of physical systems
can be modelled by a Master Equation. [21]

By α, β, we will indicate a particular conﬁguration of
the system i.e., a particular way to distribute adsorbates
over all the sites. Pα(t) will indicate the probability of
ﬁnding the system in conﬁguration α at time t and Wαβ is
the rate constant of the reaction changing conﬁguration
β to conﬁguration α.

The probability of the system being in conﬁguration
α at time t + dt can be expressed as the sum of two
terms. The ﬁrst term is the probability to ﬁnd the sys-
tem already in conﬁguration α at time t multiplied by
the probability to stay in this conﬁguration during dt.
The second term is the probability to ﬁnd the system in
some other conﬁguration β at time t multiplied by the
probability to go from β to α during dt.

Adsorption and desorption take place only at the
two marginal sites i.e., the left and rightmost sites at
the ends of the system.

to vacant nearest neighbor sites.

The initial state of the system is all that all sites are
empty (no particles in the pipe). In this paper we will
only look at steady-state properties and not to the time
dependence of the system properties starting with no par-
ticles.

C. Dynamic Monte Carlo

Master Equation analytically, DMC methods allow us to

over time. We simplify the notation of the Master Equa-
tion by deﬁning a matrix W containing the rate constants
Wαβ, and a diagonal matrix R by Rαβ
γ Wγβ, if
α = β, and 0 otherwise. If we put the probabilities of
the conﬁgurations Pα in a vector P, we can write the

Suppose at t = 0 the system is in conﬁguration α
with probability Pα(0). The probability that, at time
in conﬁguration α is given by
t, the system is still
Qαα(t)Pα(0) = exp(
Rααt)Pα(0). This shows that the
ﬁrst term represents the contribution to the probabilities
when no reaction takes place up to time t. The ma-
trix W determines how the probabilities change when
a reaction takes place. The second term represents the
contribution to the probabilities when no reaction takes
place between times 0 and t′, some reaction takes place at
time t′, and then no reaction takes place between t′ and t.
The subsequent terms represent contributions when two,
three, four, etc. reactions take place. The idea of the

DMC method is not to compute probabilities Pα(t) ex-
plicitly, but to start with some particular conﬁguration,
representative for the initial state of the experiment one
wants to simulate, and then generate a sequence of other
conﬁgurations with the correct probability. The method
generates a time t′ when the ﬁrst reaction occurs accord-
ing to the probability distribution 1
Rααt]. At
time t′ a reaction takes place such that a new conﬁgura-
tion α′ is generated by picking it out of all possible new
conﬁgurations β with a probability proportional to Wα′α.
At this point we can proceed by repeating the previous
steps, drawing again a time for a new reaction and a new
conﬁguration.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

A. No conversion

(7)

We mention in this section various results for the sys-
tem without conversion. These results can be derived
analytically. The derivations are not diﬃcult, so for com-
pleteness we give them in the appendix. We will use the
results when we deal with the system with conversion.

In a Single-File System without conversion, the rele-
vant processes to describe are adsorption, desorption and
diﬀusion. So, Wαβ is given by

Wαβ = Wads∆(ads)

αβ + Wdes∆(des)

αβ + Wdiﬀ ∆(diﬀ)

αβ

,

(8)

where ∆(rx)
αβ equals 1 if a reaction of type “rx” can trans-
form the system from β to α, and equals 0 otherwise.
Wads, Wdes, Wdiﬀ are the rate constants of adsorption,
desorption and diﬀusion respectively.

If we substitute expression (8) into the Master Equa-

tion (2), we get

Using this expression we can show that when the sys-
tem is in steady state then the probability of ﬁnding the
system in a certain conﬁguration depends only on the
number of particles in the system.

Pα = q

Nα

(10)

where Nα is the number of particles in conﬁguration α.

The expression for q(N ) is:

q(N ) =

Wdes + Wads (cid:21)
Note that diﬀusion has here no eﬀect on steady-state
properties.

To determine how the parameters of the system inﬂu-
ence the kinetics of the system, we are interested in the
correlation in the occupancy between neighboring sites.
We look at one site occupancy and at two sites occupan-
the probability that an A is at
cies. We denote by
the probability to have an A
site n and with
at site n and one at site n + 1.

An

One and two-site probabilities can be derived from the
fact that all conﬁgurations with the same number of par-
ticles have equal probability and the expressions for q(N ).
We ﬁnd

h

=

Wads
Wads + Wdes (cid:21)

(cid:20)

,

(15)

Note that this probability does not depend on the site,
all sites have equal probability to be occupied and that
there is no correlation between the occupation of neigh-
boring sites. Again diﬀusion doesn’t inﬂuence these prop-
erties. Note also that these expressions are the same as
for a model in which particles are allowed to pass each
other.

B. All sites reactive

We look ﬁrst at the situation with all sites reac-
tive:
i.e., conversion of an A into a B particle can
take place at any site including the marginal sites. For
simplicity we consider WdesA=WdesB=Wdes, and also
WdiﬀA=WdiﬀB=Wdiﬀ. We will be looking at the total
loading (Q), the total loading of A’s (QA), the total load-
ing of B’s (QB), the number of B’s produced per unit time
(Bprod), and how the distribution of A’s and B’s varies
An
from site to site (

Note that the total loading of the pipe for the model
with conversion is the same as for the model without
conversion

).

and

Q =

Wads + Wdes

(16)

The loadings and the production of B’s can easily be
derived from the probabilities
so we ﬁrst
focus on them. For a non-marginal site we can write

(A,diﬀ) is the rate of diﬀusion of A from and
where Rn
(rx) is the rate of conversion of A to
to site n, and Rn
B on site n. The conversion takes place at one site and
is therefore easier to handle than the diﬀusion. Using
equation (4) we have

We have used here the probability for a site to be vacant
that we have determined for the case without conversion.
We note that these equations are identical to the MF
equations of a system in which the particles can move
independently with a rate constant for diﬀusion equal
to Wdiﬀ Wdes/(Wdes + Wads). This means that the MF
does not really model the non-passing that characterizes
a Single-File System.

where a=a(x, t) is the probability distribution of A’s (a
similar deﬁnition holds for b), and D=Wdiﬀd2, with d the
distance between neighboring sites(see appendix). These
are the equations that are normally used to describe dif-
fusion in Single-File Systems. [19, 22, 23, 24] As this
equation is derived from the MF equations, it has the
same drawback; i.e., the Single-File behavior is only in-
corporated by the reduction of the diﬀusion, but it does
eﬀectively allow for passing of particles. This shows up
as so-called counter diﬀusion of A’s and B’s. [22, 23, 24]
We see that equations (25) are linear and we can solve
them at least numerically. We think however that it is
worthwhile to use an analytical approach. We consider

The quadratic equation yields two solutions x1 and x2

∆ , we ﬁnd ∆ =

The coeﬃcient a is to be determined from the equa-
tions for the marginal sites in the set of equations(25).
In the left side of the system n is small and (S + 1
n) is
large. Because x1 < 1 we can neglect the second term in
n. This means that the prob-
x1
equation (21) and
ability of ﬁnding an A at site in the left-hand-side of the
system is an exponentially decreasing function of the site
e− n
1/ln(x1)
index. If we write
for the characteristic length of the decrease. The loga-
rithm makes this length only a slowly varying function
of the rate constants(see ﬁgure 2). When Wdiﬀ becomes
larger, α approaches 0, x1 approaches 1 and ∆ diverges.
Note that this is a MF result. We will see that in the
simulations ∆ remains ﬁnite. Also when the conversion
is slow more A’s are found away from the marginal sites.
The second factor in the expression for α equals the re-
ciprocal of a site being vacant. Low loading leads to a
smaller α than high loading. Because of the vacancies
the A’s can penetrate farther into the system before be-
ing converted. For slow conversion or fast diﬀusion α is
small and ∆ can be approximated by

crease the productivity of the system, we consider for the
comparisons of the results a system size S = 30. We have
considered separately the sets of parameters in Table I.
The sets of parameters from a) to e) are for the cases
of low loading and from f) to j) for the high loading. The
parameters in the table describe the following situations:
a) and f) for very slow reaction and slow diﬀusion; b) and
g) for slow reaction and slow diﬀusion; c) and h) for slow
reaction and fast diﬀusion; d) and i) for fast reaction and

TABLE II: Simulation and MF results for QA and Bprod for
all the sets of parameters

slow diﬀusion; e) and j) for fast reaction and fast diﬀu-
sion.

We can see from Table II that the simulation and MF
results match for all the cases except the cases when we
have low reaction rates and fast diﬀusion for both low
and high loading. In these cases MF overestimates the
amount of A’s in the pipe, and consequently overesti-
mates the B production.
In ﬁgure 4 we have the site
occupancy with A and B both from the simulations and
MF. We again see that the MF and the simulation re-
sults agree reasonably well, except for low reaction rates
and fast diﬀusion. MF overestimates the characteristic
length ∆ and allows A’s to penetrate farther into the
pipe than in the simulations. The reason for this is that
MF describes the fact that the particles cannot pass each
other by reducing the diﬀusion, but this eﬀectively does
allow for passing. The larger ∆ in MF means also a
larger QA. As a consequence the B production in MF is
larger and, because these B’s have to be able to leave the
pipe via desorption, the probabilities
are
BS
h
i
larger in MF. The probabilities
are there-
A1i
h
fore smaller, which means that the MF curves and the
simulation curves in ﬁgure cross each other, as can actu-
ally be seen. The behavior of the system at high loading
and at low loading is about the same, except that ∆ is
smaller at high loading.
One might expect that the larger the number of reactive
sites the more B’s will be produced in the pipe. From the
simulations we see that the amount of B’s produced per
unit time by all reactive sites goes to a limit value when
the number of reactive sites is increased. In ﬁgure 5, the
marked line represents the B production as a function
on the length of the pipe and the dashed line the B pro-
duction according to MF. For short pipe lengths, the B
production from both MF and simulations increase lin-
early with S, while for higher lengths it converges to a
limiting value. The limiting value is higher for MF. This
could be seen also from the Table II. According to MF
there are more B produced in the pipe.

For the case Wads → ∞
Bprod =

we have

(37)

From the simulations (see ﬁgure 3) we see that for high
adsorption rates, Bprod converges to a point and the
corresponding value is equal to the analytical value for
the case adsorption is inﬁnitely fast. The reason for
this is that all the sites are occupied, diﬀusion is com-
pletely suppressed, and only the marginal sites play a
role. The expression above can be seen as a factor 2
for the two marginal sites, the probability that an A at
the marginal sites is converted to a B before it desorbs
Wrx/Wrx + Wdes, and the rate constant for desorption
Wdes.

The accuracy of the simulation results for QA and
Bprod can be derived by looking at the total loading Q in
Table II. For the total loading Q, the simulation results
can be compared with the values of the exact expression
(12). We remark that the largest deviation from the ex-
act analytical results is 0.04, so the relative errors are
around 0.02%.

The diﬀerences between MF and the simulations be-
. Because
comes especially clear in the limit Wdiﬀ → ∞
this limit makes the system homogeneous in MF we get

QB =

Wads
Wads + Wdes

Wrx
Wrx + Wdes

,

QA =

Wads
Wads + Wdes

Wdes
Wrx + Wdes

.

(38)

(39)

The ﬁrst factor in these expressions is the probability
that a site is occupied. The second factor indicates if the
particle is converted to a B or not before it desorbs. The
simulations show that the system should not be homoge-
neous at all (see ﬁgure 6). The B production increases
linearly with S only for the case of inﬁnitely-fast diﬀu-
sion, otherwise it converges to a limiting value.

C. Only some of the sites reactive

We consider now the situation that not all the sites
are reactive, and that these reactive sites can be either
uniformly distributed inside the pipe or distributed in
compact blocks. We will show that the number of reac-
tive sites doesn’t change qualitatively the properties of
the system. QA, QB and number of B produced for a
variable number of reactive sites are compared with the
previous results.

FIG. 6: Analytical and simulation results for site occupancy of a system when parameters are: S = Nreac = 30, Wads=0.8,

all the sites are reactive. We introduce an extra coef-
ﬁcient ∆n in the MF equations to the reaction term.
∆n = 1 if n is a reactive site and ∆n = 0 if it is not
a reactive site. The steady-state equations are identical
to equations (25), except that Wrx should be replaced
by Wrx∆n. The resulting set of equations is linear again
and it should be possible to solve them numerically. In
fact only the probabilities for the marginal and reactive
sites have to be solved numerically. For the other sites
the probabilities can be obtained by simple linear inter-
polation. That this is correct can be seen because those
sites only have the diﬀusion term. We can also remove
the probabilities for the B’s, because we have from the
model without conversion that

The resulting equations for the reactive sites have the
same form as equation (25) for the non-marginal sites.
We expect therefore that we get an exponential decrease
of
on the reactive sites when we move from the
marginal sites to the center of the pipe, and a linear de-
pendence on n between the unreactive sites.

Simulation results

The number of reactive sites is considered to vary from
1 to 50% and the reactive sites are distributed either in
blocks situated near the marginal sites, in the middle of
the pipe, or homogeneously distributed in the pipe. We
will ﬁrst compare the MF results with the MC simula-
tion results for diﬀerent sets of parameters and then we
look at the dependence of B production and total load-
ing QA on the number and position of reactive sites. For
the comparison between MF and MC results we consider
the system size S = 30 and the number of reactive sites
Nreac = 10. The sets of parameters used for the speciﬁc
situations to be studied are the same as the sets used in
the case with all the sites reactive in the previous section.
We can see from the Tables III and IV that when the
reactive sites are homogeneously distributed or situated
as a block in the middle of the pipe, there are signiﬁcant
diﬀerences between MF results and MC results. When
the reactive sites form blocks near the marginal sites, the
results are almost the same as when all sites are reactive:
the MC and the MF results diﬀer if we have fast diﬀusion
and slow reaction. The sites in the center of the pipe are
not relevant when the sites at the ends of the pipe are
reactive. When the reactive sites are situated only in the
middle of the pipe, we have deviations for all the sets of
parameters. They are very prominent for the case when
we have high loading, fast diﬀusion and fast reaction.
MF strongly underestimates A’s for all non-reactive sites,
but we have also important deviations for high loading in
the cases with fast diﬀusion-slow reaction, slow diﬀusion-
fast reaction, and slow diﬀusion-slow reaction. This is
happening because for high loading, the end sites will

always be occupied by a particle A and the B’s will not
be able to get out of the pipe. In MF particles eﬀectively
can pass each other, so B particles are then able to get out
of the pipe. Even for the case of low loading we still have
deviations from MF for fast diﬀusion and fast reaction.
In this case MF overestimates A’s for nonreactive sites.
For fast diﬀusion and slow reaction, MF underestimates
A’s for nonreactive sites and for slow diﬀusion and slow
reaction MF overestimates B’s for the reactive sites in
the middle.

look very
diﬀerent when the reactive sites form a block in the mid-
dle of the pipe. The MF results show, as predicted, a
linear behavior at the nonreactive sites. The MC results
show, however, a nonlinear behavior in the form of S-like
curves. At the reactive sites the behavior is similar to
the situation with all sites reactive with the MC results
showing a more rapid approach to the value at the mid-
dle of the pipe than MF, i.e., smaller ∆. The values at
the marginal sites can diﬀer between MC and MF quite
a lot. This reﬂects the diﬀerence in Bprod mentioned be-
fore: a diﬀerent Bprod must be accompanied by a diﬀerent
B desorption at steady-state. As we have already seen
from the case when all the sites were reactive, Bprod very
rapidly approaches the limiting value when the pipe is
made longer (see ﬁgure 5). Similarly when we start with
few reactive sites and, instead of increasing the length of
the pipe, we increase the number of reactive sites. The
loading QB is already almost the same as the value with
all sites reactive when only about 10% of all sites are re-
active provided there are reactive sites at or very near
the marginal sites. If the reactive sites are moved away
from the ends of the pipe, then the loading QB and the
B production decreases.

SUMMARY

We have used analytical and simulation techniques to

study the reactivity in Single-File Systems.

The MF results show that MF models Single-File be-
havior by changing the diﬀusion rate constant, but it
eﬀectively does allow passing of particles.

When all the sites are reactive, the simulation and MF
results are very similar for all the parameters, except
for the case when we have low reaction rates and fast
diﬀusion. In these cases MF overestimates the amount of
A’s in the pipe. The amount of B produced per unit time
by all reactive sites goes to a limit value when the number
of reactive sites is increased. For high adsorption rates,
Bprod converges to a point and the corresponding value

TABLE IV: Simulation and MF results for Bprod for all the sets of parameters in the cases of homogeneous distribution of the
reactive sites, blocks of reactive sites in the middle of the pipe and near the marginal sites (S = 30, Nreac = 10)

is equal to the analytical value for the case adsorption is
inﬁnitely fast. The sites in the middle of the pipe have
no eﬀect on the B production. The diﬀerences between
MF and the simulations becomes especially clear in the
.
limit Wdiﬀ → ∞

When only some of the sites are reactive, there are sig-
niﬁcant diﬀerences between MF and MC results when the
reactive sites are homogeneously distributed or situated
as a block in the middle of the pipe. When the reactive
sites form blocks near the marginal sites, the results are
almost the same as when all sites are reactive: The MC
and the MF results diﬀer only when we have fast diﬀu-
sion and slow reaction. The sites in the center of the pipe
are not relevant when the sites at the ends of the pipe
are reactive. When the reactive sites are situated in the
middle of the pipe, we have deviations for all the sets of
parameters. They are very prominent for the case when
we have high loading, fast diﬀusion and fast reaction. MF
strongly underestimates A’s for all non-reactive sites, but
we have also important deviations for high loading in the
cases with fast diﬀusion-slow reaction, slow diﬀusion-fast
reaction, slow diﬀusion-slow reaction. The MF results
show a linear behavior at the nonreactive sites. The MC
results show, however, a nonlinear behavior in the form
of S-like curves. The loading QB is already almost the
same as the value with all sites reactive when only about

10% of all sites are reactive provided there are reactive
sites at or very near the marginal sites. If the reactive
sites are moved away from the ends of the pipe, then the
loading QB and the B production decreases.

We have used Monte-Carlo methods and analytial tehniques to investigate the in(cid:13)uene of the

harateristi parameters, suh as pipe length, di(cid:11)usion, adsorption, desorption and reation rate

onstants on the steady-state properties of Single-File Systems with a reation. We looked at ases

when all the sites are reative and when only some of them are reative. Comparisons between

Mean-Field preditions and Monte Carlo simulations for the oupany pro(cid:12)les and reativity are

made. Substantial di(cid:11)erenes between Mean-Field and the simulations are found when rates of

di(cid:11)usion are high. Mean-Field results only inlude Single-File behavior by hanging the di(cid:11)usion

rate onstant, but it e(cid:11)etively allows passing of partiles. Reativity onverges to a limit value

if more reative sites are added: sites in the middle of the system have little or no e(cid:11)et on the

kinetis. Oupany pro(cid:12)les show approximately exponential behavior from the ends to the middle

of the system.

Abstract

A new theoretical formalism for the optimal quantum control has been presented.

The approach stems from the consideration of describing the time-dependent quantum

systems in terms of the real physical observables, viz., the probability density ρ(x, t)

and the quantum current j(x,t) which is well documented in the Bohm’s hydrodynamical

formulation of quantum mechanics. The approach has been applied for manipulating the

vibrational motion of HBr in its ground electronic state under an external electric ﬁeld.

1 Introduction

Manipulating the outcome of a chemical dynamics by properly tailoring an external

ﬁeld has been one of the active ﬁeld of research in the recent days [1-14]. Problems where

the external ﬁeld is an electromagnetic ﬁeld have received the most attention [2-14], al-

though other applications may arise as well. Theoretically, there are two basic paradigms

for such control : a static control scheme [13,14] and a dynamic control scheme [2-12]. In

the static scheme [13,14] one uses two or more cw light ﬁelds(optical coherence) and the

superposition of two or more eigenstates(molecular coherence) to cause interference be-

tween diﬀerent plausible pathways to a ﬁnal quantum state, and the outcome is controlled

by tailoring diﬀerent parameters of the optical and molecular coherences. Whereas the

dynamic scheme [2-12] creates non-stationary states of one’s choice, by optimally design-

ing the electric ﬁeld. This comes under the domain of the optimal control theory [15], a

mathematical tool commonly used in the engineering ﬁelds. A basic diﬃculty in attaining

the control designs is the computational eﬀort called for in solving the time-dependent

Schroedinger equation, often repeatedly in an iterative fashion over an extended spatial

region.

In this paper, we introduce a new formulation aiming at reducing the eﬀort for the

quantum optimal control(QOC). Our recent work [16,17] has shown that the Bohmian

quantum hydrodynamics(BQH) is capable of being much more eﬃcient than the conven-

tional method(e.g., FFT propagation) and this should carry over to the optimal control

task. This paper will show how the BQH can be utilized in the QOC. The formulation is

based on the hydrodynamic description of the quantum mechanics emerging mainly from

the work of David Bohm [18,19] where the dynamics is described by two equations, viz.,

the equation of motion for the probability density, ρ(r, t) and that for the quantum current,
j(r,t) which are deﬁned as ρ(r, t) = Ψ∗(r, t)Ψ(r, t) and j(r, t) = 1
m Im[Ψ∗∇Ψ − Ψ∇Ψ∗],

Ψ being the complex wave function in the time dependent Schroedinger equation(TDSE)

and Im refers to the imaginary value. Thus one by-passes the explicit use of the time

dependent Schroedinger equation(TDSE) and hence the typically oscillatory nature of

3

the complex wave ﬁnction. This seems beniﬁciary at the ﬁrst place because (i) one deals

with the real quantum mechanical variables, and (ii) density and quantum current posses

a smooth spatial variation as opposed to the wave function. Recent illustrations [16,17]

have demonstrated the smooth spatial and temporal nature of the variables and the abil-

ity to discretize them on a relatively small number of grid points. In pursuing the paper

we maintain the following layout. In section 2 we give a brief account of the BQH. In

section 3 we provide the QOC formulation based on the BQH. In section 4 we apply the

method for manipulating the vibrational motion of HBr molecule in its ground electronic

state. Section 5 concludes the paper.

2 Bhomian Quantum Hydrodynamics

Despite its extraordinary success, quantum mechanics has since its inception

some seventy years ago, been plagued by conceptual diﬃculties. According to orthodox

quantum theory, the complete description of a system of particles is provided by its wave

function Ψ which obeys the time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation.

According to Bohm [18], the complete description of a quantum system is
provided by its wave function Ψ(q, t), q ∈ R3, and its conﬁguration Q ∈ R3 where Q is

the position of the particle. The wave function, which evolves according to Schr¨odinger’s

equation(Eq.(1)) choreographs the motion of the particle which evolves according to the

equation

Equations (1) and (2) give a complete speciﬁcation of the quantum theory

describing the behaviour of any observables or their eﬀects of measurement. Note that

Bohm’s formulation incorporates Schr¨odinger’s equation into a rational theory, describing

the motion of particles, merely by adding a single equation, the guiding equation(Eq.(2)).

In so doing it provides a precise role for the wave function in sharp contrast with its rather

obscure status in orthodox quantum theory. The additional equation(Eq.(2)) emerges in

an almost inevitable manner. Bell’s preference is to observe that the probability current
jΨ and the probability density ρ = Ψ∗Ψ would classically be related by j = ρv obviously

suggests that

Bohm, in his seminal hidden-variable paper wrote the wave function Ψ in the
polar form Ψ = ReiS/¯h where S is real and R ≥ 0, and then rewrote the schr¨odingers’s

equation in terms of these new variables, obtaining a pair of coupled evolution equations,

the continuity equation for ρ = R2 as

which suggests that ρ be interpreted as a probability density, and a modiﬁed Hamilton-

Jacobi equation for S,

Eq.(6) diﬀers from the classical Hamilton-Jacobi equation only by the appearence

of an extra term, the quantum potential Vq. Similar to the classical Hamilton-Jacobi

which is equivalent to Eq.(4). This is precisely what would have been obtained classically

if the particles were acted upon by the force generated by quantum potential in addition

to the usual forces. Although an interpretation in classical terms is beautufully laid down

in the above equations, one should keep in mind that in so doing, the linear Schr¨odinger

equation is transformed into a highly nonlinear equations(eqs.(5) and (6)). By taking the

gradient on both sides of Eq.(6) we obtain

v = −(v.∇)v − v × (∇ × v) −

ρ(q, t)v(q, t) and using the equation ∇ × v = 0 we readily obtain the expression for the

motion of the quantum current as

j = −v(∇.j) − (j.∇)v −

∇(V + Vq)

(10)

Eqs.(5), (6), (9) and (10) describe the motion of a quantum particle in the

hydrodynamical representation of TDSE. However, the many-particle description of the

BQH can be found elsewhere [24]. It may be noted that density alone cannot suﬃciently

describe a quantum system, one requires both density and the quantum current for the

purpose. As is evident, the motion of a quantum particle is governed by the quantum

current vector j unlike the TDSE where the time propagator eiHt has the key role for the

particle’s motion. The diﬃculties arising out of the evaluation of the exponential of an

operator in more than one dimension is completely bypassed in the HDE. Although the

hydrodynamical equations resemble the classical ﬂuid dynamical equations, the quantum

identity is prevailed because of the fact that the quantum current evolves with respect to

a potential Vq which has no classical analogue [19]. It should be be noted that the term

Vq was inherrently present in the expression to stabilize the hydrodynamical approach

to the TDSE. The numerical instability in the hydrodynamical approach to the TDSE

without the presence of Vq term may be related to the “shock” formation in the classical

hydrodynamics(cf. Navier Stokes equation) without some ﬁctitious smoothing potential.

6

In the numerical solution we shall work with the equations governing the motion of den-

sity(Eq.(5)) and the quantum current(Eq.(10)). The motivations of considering the above

equations lie in the fact that (i) density ρ and quantum current J are uniquely deﬁned for

a given potential in many-body system whereas the phase S can be multivalued(S=S±

nπ, n=even) and (ii) they are quantum mechanical observables. The equations 5 and 6

suggest that one can obtain density and the quantum current directly for t > 0 provided,

the values were known at t = 0. Thus, the scheme by-passes the evaluation of the wave

function during the the occurrence of the dynamics. However, at t=0, one has to solve

the time-independent Schr¨odinger equation for the wave function and calculate ρ(q, 0)

and j(q, 0).

3 Quantum Optimal Control and Bhomian Quantum

Hydrodynamics

Quantum optimal control theory seeks the design of an external ﬁeld to fulﬁll

a particular objective. This section will provide the rigorous mathematical formulation

of the hydrodynamic method to design an optimal time dependent ﬁeld that drives a

quantum wave packet to a desired objective at the target time t=T. For this purpose,

consider a general target expectation value deﬁned as ΘT =

T
0 Θρ(x, T )dx, where Θ is an
R

observable operator and ρ(x, T ) is the probability density which obeys the hydrodynamical

equations, viz., Eqs.(5) and (10). The goal is to steer ΘT as close as possible to a desired

value Θd. We deﬁne a quadratic cost functional as

Jq =

ωa(ΘT − Θd)2

1
2

Minimization of Jq amounts to the equalization of ΘT to Θd. However, ρ in the above

equation must obey the hydrodynamical equations, viz., Eqs.(5) and (10). Thus, we have

to fulﬁll this constraint whereby we obtain the unconstrained cost functional as

¯J = Jq −

where Vext(t) represents the external potential due to the interaction between the particle

and the electric ﬁeld, E(t) to be designed.

Thus, in the above equations, we have introduced two Lagrange’s multipliers

λ1(x, t) and λ2(x, t). There exists another constraint involving the total energy in the

ﬁeld which must be imposed on the optimization procedure. This constraint takes the

form

λ2(x, t) and E(t), all of which are real, unlike in the conventional method [6-8]. In the

above equations capital J is for cost functional and small j is for quantum current. The

Note that the above expression for ΘT restricts the operator Θ being only

a multiplicative operator, for example, the distant ˆx which we have used in the sub-

sequent numerical calculations. However, other forms of operator can also be consid-

ered in the BQH-QOC formulation with the diﬀerent constraint expressions, e.g., if Θ is

the momentum operator(ˆp) we would require the constraint equations (5) and (9) since

pT = m

The equations for λ1 and λ2 ressemble to that of ρ and j with only diﬀerence

being the extra source terms S1 and S2. The source terms depend on ρ and j. vλ in

the above equations is the velocity associated with the Lagrange’s multiplier and is given

as vλ = λ1

λ2 and Vq(λ2) is given by Vq(λ2) = − ¯h
2µ

. Notice that Eqs.(17) and (18)

are the equations of motion for the probability density and the quantum current density

respectively obtained in section 2. Whereas Eqs.(24) and (25) are the equations of motion

for the two Lagrange’s multipliers λ2 and λ1 respectively.

It should be noted that in

obtaining the above equations(see Appendix-A) we have assumed no variation on either

ρ(x, 0) or j(x,0). Thus, we start from an initial(t=0) ρ(x, 0) and j(x,0) to solve Eqs.(17)

and (18) for ρ(x, t) and j(x,t) respectively. Equations (24) and (25) can be solved for

λ1(x, t) and λ2(x, t) provided a starting value λ1(x, ts) and λ2(x, ts) were known. These

have been obtained from Eqs.(21) and (22) respectively as

λ1(x, ts) = ωa[ΘT − Θd]x and λ2(x, ts) = 0

(28)

where ts = T , the ﬁnal time. Thus, one has to perform backward propagation for solving

both the equations of motion involving λ1(x, t) and λ2(x, t). Having calculated ρ(x, t),

j(x,t), λ1(x, t) and λ2(x, t) as described above, one has to carry out an optimization of the

10

quadratic cost functional(Eq.(11)) with respect to the electric ﬁeld E(t) which, according

to Eq.(23), takes the form

4 Application to HBr Molecule

We have said in the preceeding section that we needed the initial density ρ(x, 0)

and the quantum current j(x,0) in the presnt method. These have been evaluated by
+ state
solving the time independent Schroedinger equation for HBr molecule in the 1

where the the potential energy is assumed Morse type of the form [20]

Having obtained ρ(x, 0) and j(x,0) we carry out the control by the present method.

Followings are the necessary steps for the computer implementation of the present method

calculation.

Step 1: Make an initial guess for the electric ﬁeld E(t), which is zero in our

Step 2:

Solve the coupled equations, viz., Eq.(17) and (18) for ρ(x, t) and

j(x,t) respectively starting from ρ(x, 0) and j(x,0). The solution is

done by using the Flux-corrected transport(FCT) algorithm [21] mod-

iﬁed by us for the purpose of solving the quantum hydrodynamical

equations [16,17]. In doing so, we adopt the Eulerian scheme

Step 3: Evaluate the ﬁnal values for λ1(x, T ) and λ2(x, T ) given by Eq.(28).

11

Step 4: Use λ1(x, T ) and λ2(x, T ) for solving Eqs.(24) and (25) for λ1(x, t)

and λ2(x, t) respectively. This is done by backward propagation, by

putting dt=-dt(see ref.16). We follow the same method as in step

2 for solving these equations. It should be noted that Eqs.(24) and

(25) have source terms which depend on ρ(x, t) and j(x,t) calculated

in step 2.

Step 5: Calculate the quadratic cost functional given by Eq.(11).

Step 6: Optimize the function in Eq.(11) with respect to the electric ﬁeld,

E(t) given by Eq. (29). Here we use the conjugate direction search

method [22] for the optimization.

Step 7:

Iterate step 2 to step 6 until a convergence criterion is satisﬁed.

The external potential is of the form Vext(x, t) = −µ(x)E(t), where µ(x) is
the dipole function for HBr and is given by [23] µ(x) = A0 + A1(x − xe) + A2(x − xe)2

where A0 = 0.788, A1 = 0.315 and A2 = 0.575. In our calculation the range of spatial

dimension is 0 ≤ x ≤ 12 a.u., that of time is 0 ≤ t ≤ 2000 a.u. Total number of spatial

mesh points is 60 which gives ∆x = 0.2 a.u. Similarly, total number of time steps is 2000,

which corresponds to ∆t = 1.0 a.u. ωe in Eq.(27) is taken as 0.5, and ωa as 1000. The

target operator is Θ = x and Θd = 3.0 a.u. and 3.5 a.u.

Figure 1 shows the electric ﬁelds corresponding to two diﬀerent values of

Θd viz., 3.0(solid lines) and 3.5(dotted lines). These pulses excite several vibrational

states(not shown here) mainly by a sequence of single quantum transitions. The peak
value of the ﬁeld is ≈ 0.08a.u.(corresponding intensity is ≈ 1014W cm−2) for Θd = 3.5a.u.
and ≈ 0.02a.u.(corresponding intensity is ≈ 1013W cm−2) for Θd = 3.0a.u.. The detail

characterization of the optimal ﬁeld can however, be made by Fourier transforming the

ﬁeld. Fig.2 shows the average distance < x > as a function of time. Notice the desired

control of < x >= 3.0 and 3.5 a.u. at T=2000 a.u.

is obtained through the oscillatory

motion of the packed induced by the optimal electric pulse(Fig.1). Figure 3 shows the

initial and ﬁnal densities for the two values of Θd. The packet is distorted in shape while

12

approximately retaining its original variance during the evolution. During the optimiza-

tion process the total integrated probability density remained at unity up to a deviation
of 10−7. The number of iterations in the optimization to achieve the results is 5 and it

takes only 3 minutes(real) on a IRIX IP30 machine with R4400 6.0 CPU. As a test for the

acceptability of the present method we have carried on the following experiment : The

electric ﬁelds(Fig.1) so obtained have been pluged into the TDSE and then solved for the

wave function. The results for the density and the expectation value of < x > resemble

accurately to that given in Fig.2.

5. Conclusion

In the present paper we have presented a new scheme for carrying out the optimal

design based on BQH. We have derived the control equations to obtain a time dependent

external ﬁeld with an illustration for the manipulation of the vibrational motion of HBr
+ state. The working dynamical variables in the BQH , viz., ρ(Fig.3),

molecule in the 1

j, λ1 and λ2 are relatively slowly varying spatial functions(Fig. 4) compared to the wave

P

function(ﬁg.4, curve a) which apparently enhances the eﬃciency and the numerical saving

of the BQH-QOC method for controlling dynamics.

Although the illustration of our new method has been made in one spatial

dimension, the approach is general and is directly extendable to higher dimensions and

a wave packet dynamics in four dynamics has already been performed [16] within our

method. The use of the alternating direction implicit(ADI) [16,17] in the present method

makes the quantum control calculation much easier compared to the conventional method,

especially for the multidimensional problem. In the conventional optimal control theory,

the role of the complex Lagrange’s multiplier is to provide feedback[6] for designing the

electric ﬁeld and guide the dynamics to an acceptable solution. The BQH-QOC method,

on the other hand, introduces two such Lagrange’s multipliers, λ1 and λ2 both of which

are real variables. The ﬁrst Lagrange’s multiplier λ1, which corresponds to the quantum

current j(cf. Eq.(18) and (25)) has however, no direct role to provide feedback for designing

13

the electric ﬁeld(Eq.(29)) and only guides the dynamics in conjunction with the second

Lagrange’s multiplier λ2.

It may be worth mentioning that since the quadratic cost

functional(Eq.(11)) is a functional of density, the Lagrange’s multiplier λ2(equivalent to

the density ρ, cf. Eq.(17) and (24)) enters into the expression for the optimal electric

ﬁeld(Eq. (29)). However, cases where one desires to manipulate the quantum ﬂux(which

is directly related to the quantum current j) by constructing a quadratic cost functional

dependent on j, the Lagrange’s multiplier λ1 will appear explicitly into the expression for

the external ﬁeld.

It should be pointed out that the present method could prove hard in cases

where the dynamics may lead to the creation of the nodes in the density proﬁle since the

quantum potential appearing in the constraint equation blows up in the occurence of such

an event. However, such occurence of nodes can be countered by ﬁxing a lower limit to the

density of the order of the machine precision. This in other words means that one never

encounters an absolute nodal point where the density is exactly zero. Future studies

need to explore the other area of control within the BQH-QOC method, for example,

controlling the quantum ﬂux.

Now, we have δV = 0 and δVext can be written as δVext = −δ(µ(x)E(t)) = −µ(x)δE(t) −

E(t)δµ(x). Since µ(x) is kept ﬁxed, we get δVext = −µ(x)δE(t). Jq in the above equation

Where xr and xl are the right and left ends of the one dimensional grid, and

F (x)|xr

xl = F (xr) − F (xl) where F (x) is any function. The ﬁrst and the second terms in
Eq.(A.12) are the contributions due to the change in the quantum potential at the two

ends of the boundary only. Since, we take a large grid, ρ at the two ends of the grid

are very small and can be assumed constant. This leads to Vq(xr, t) and Vq(xl, t) being

17

very high constant values at any time and hence δVq(xr, t) = δVq(xl, t) = 0. With the

same argument we can also neglect the contributions due to the terms 3rd, 4th and 5th.
Combining all the terms we obtain the full variation in ¯J as

This expression has 26 terms. Out of which, 5-th and 8-th terms can be dropped

because we do not vary the initial density and quantum current. Again, 10-th, 11-th,

13-th, 14-th, 16-th and 17-th terms can also be dropped with the assumption that ρ(x, t)
and j(x,t) are very small at the boundary. Thus, the actual full variation in ¯J becomes

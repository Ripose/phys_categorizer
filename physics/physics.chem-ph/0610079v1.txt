New ab initio potential energy surfaces for the 2Π ground electronic state of the Ar–SH complex are
presented, calculated at the RCCSD(T)/aug-cc-pV5Z level. Weakly bound rotation-vibration levels
are calculated using coupled-channel methods that properly account for the coupling between the
two electronic states. The resulting wavefunctions are analysed and a new adiabatic approximation
including spin-orbit coupling is proposed. The ground-state wavefunctions are combined with those
obtained for the excited 2Σ+ state [Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 6, 5463 (2004)] to produce transition
dipole moments. Modelling the transition intensities as a combination of these dipole moments and
calculated lifetime values [J. Chem. Phys. 109, 170 (1998)] leads to a good representation of the
experimental ﬂuorescence excitation spectrum [J. Chem. Phys. 98, 4301 (1993)].

I.

INTRODUCTION

Van der Waals complexes containing open-shell species
are of great current interest.
In particular, complexes
containing atoms or molecules with orbital angular mo-
mentum necessarily involve multiple electronic states.1,2
They provide a test-bed for studying electronically non-
adiabatic eﬀects, which are important in the theory
of reaction dynamics.3,4,5 In addition, the observation
of pre-reactive Van der Waals complexes trapped in
bound levels6,7,8,9,10 can shed light on intermolecular
forces in the entrance and exit channels of chemical
reactions.11,12,13,14 The form of these shallow,
long-
range wells can be important in determining reaction
outcomes15,16 and transition-state geometries.17,18

In this paper, we consider the complex consisting of
an open-shell SH radical and an Ar atom. New ab ini-
tio potential energy surfaces (PESs) for the X 2Π state
are presented, and used in calculations of the bound
rotation-vibration levels. We discuss the possibility of
employing an approximate approach in the bound-state
calculations, using a single adiabatic PES rather than
the two surfaces used in the standard method.1 Finally,
the bound-state energies and wavefunctions are used to
simulate the vibrationally resolved electronic spectrum.
The Ar–SH cluster was ﬁrst detected experimentally
by Miller and co-workers19 using laser-induced ﬂuores-
cence excitation spectroscopy. Subsequently this group
developed empirical potential energy surfaces for the
complex, for both the A state20 and the X state,21 by
ﬁtting model functions to reproduce laser-induced ﬂuo-
rescence (LIF) results. The region of the A state PES
corresponding to the Ar–S-H conﬁguration (Jacobi an-
gles between ∼ 90 and 180 degrees) was determined only

approximately, because the ﬂuorescence experiments did
not probe this zone. More recently, Hirst et al.22 have
presented a PES for the A state based on ab-initio cal-
culations at the RCCSD(T) level with the aug-cc-pV5Z
basis set. This surface was used to predict bound vibra-
tional levels in the Ar–S-H conﬁguration22 which have
not, to our knowledge, been observed in experiment so
far. A possible reason why these levels have eluded de-
tection is discussed in section IV of this paper.

Sumiyoshi et al.23 have recorded high-resolution spec-
tra for Ar–SH in the ground electronic state us-
ing Fourier-transform microwave (FTMW) spectroscopy.
These authors also produced PESs for the X state based
on ﬁtting a function to reproduce their experimental
results,23 and these surfaces were later improved with
the aid of some ab initio results.24 Most recently, re-
sults from microwave-millimeter-wave double-resonance
spectroscopy25 were employed to determine new three-
dimensional PESs for the X state.26

The family of weakly bound clusters containing a rare
gas atom and either the OH or SH radical have been
reviewed by Carter et al.27 in 2000 and by Heaven28 in
2005.

The structure of the present paper is as follows.
In
Section II we present new PESs for Ar–SH (2Π) based
entirely on ab initio calculations at the RCCSD(T) level
with an aug-cc-pV5Z basis set.
In Section III we de-
scribe bound rotation-vibration level calculations using
these surfaces. We also investigate the wavefunctions and
introduce a new adiabatic approximation for the bound
states, including spin-orbit coupling. In Section IV the
results are combined with those of a previous study of
the A 2Σ+ state, in order to produce a high-quality sim-
ulation of the vibrationally resolved electronic spectrum.

II. POTENTIAL ENERGY SURFACES

The geometry of the complex is speciﬁed in terms of
body-ﬁxed Jacobi coordinates r, R and θ. R is the length
of the vector R which links the center of mass of the
SH fragment to the Ar nucleus. The vector r links the
its modulus r is the SH
S nucleus to the H nucleus:
bond length. The angle between R and r is θ, so that
θ = 0 corresponds to a linear Ar–H-S conﬁguration. For
this work the bond length r was held constant at the
experimentally determined equilibrium value of 1.3409
˚A,29 which is justiﬁed because the vibrational motion of
the diatom is very weakly coupled to the relatively low-
frequency Van der Waals modes of interest.

Energies were calculated for a regular grid of ge-
ometry points using the MOLPRO quantum chemistry
program.30 These points are at every distance R from
3.25 ˚A to 5.5 ˚A in steps of 0.25 ˚A and for every angle θ
from 0◦ to 180◦ in steps of 15◦. This gives a total of 130
points. We used the RCCSD(T) method (restricted cou-
pled cluster with single, double and non-iterative triple
excitations)31,32 with the aug-cc-pV5Z basis set.33,34,35
The counterpoise procedure of Boys and Bernardi36 was
used to correct for basis set superposition error (BSSE).
This is the same level of theory and basis set as were
used in recent calculations of the PES for the A-state of
Ar–SH.22

Two potential surfaces were obtained from the ab ini-
tio calculations. These correspond to two adiabatic elec-
tronic states: one symmetric (A′) and one antisymmetric
(A′′) with respect to reﬂection in the plane of the nuclei.
The two states are degenerate at linear geometries but
nondegenerate at nonlinear geometries: the splitting is
an example of the Renner-Teller eﬀect. The interaction
energies for each state were interpolated using a 2D spline
function, and contour plots of the resulting surfaces are
shown in Fig. 1. The A′ and A′′ surfaces result from
the electronic Hamiltonian without spin-orbit coupling:
a discussion of surfaces including spin-orbit coupling is
presented in section IV.

The adiabatic surfaces (adiabats) are qualitatively sim-
ilar to those reported for He–SH and Ne–SH complexes.37
The latter were calculated at the RCCSD(T) level, using
the smaller aug-cc-pVTZ basis set, but with an additional
set of bond functions, and counterpoise correction. A
comparison of the positions and energies of the minima
on the Ar–SH surfaces presented here with those for X-
state He–SH and Ne–SH is given in Table I. For all the
A′′ surfaces there is a global minimum in the linear X–
S-H conﬁguration (where X is He, Ne or Ar) and a local
minimum in the linear X–H-S conﬁguration. The X–H-S
conﬁgurations are saddle points on the A′ surfaces, which
have shallow local minima at θ = 180◦ and global min-
ima at nonlinear conﬁgurations. The A′ global minima
are deeper than those on the A′′ surfaces, because in the
A′ state the SH π hole is directed towards the Ar atom,
resulting in reduced repulsion. The global minima for the
A′ state occur at angles θ that increase with the atomic

ima are deeper for clusters containing heavier (and more
polarizable) rare gas atoms.

In order to perform dynamical calculations on Ar–SH,
we need to evaluate the matrix elements of the poten-
tial between electronic states labelled with an angular
momentum quantum number λ. For this purpose it is
convenient to re-express the potential energy surfaces as

are quite similar to those recently presented by Sumiyoshi

results, with starting values for the potential parameters
obtained from ab initio calculations (RCCSD(T)/aug-cc-
pVTZ). The form of our sum potential is also qualita-
tively similar to those recently presented for Ne–SH and
Kr–SH by Suma et al.38

III. BOUND-STATE CALCULATIONS

A. Coupled channel calculations

The bound states of a complex such as Ar–SH (X 2Π)
involve both potential energy surfaces.
In the present
work we use a coupled-channel approach to calculate the
bound states. In a body-ﬁxed axis system the Hamilto-
nian operator is

The monomer basis functions are labelled by Hund’s case
(a) quantum numbers λ and σ, the projections of the elec-
tronic orbital and spin angular momentum along the SH
axis, and ω = λ+σ.52 λ, σ and ω are all signed quantities.
The D functions are Wigner rotation matrices.39 The
ﬁrst D function describes the rotation of the monomer
with respect to body-ﬁxed axes, with angular momen-
tum quantum number j (including electronic orbital and
spin angular momentum) and projection P along the in-
termolecular vector R. The second D function describes
the rotation of the complex as a whole, with total angular
momentum J and projections M and P onto space-ﬁxed
and body-ﬁxed axes respectively. The angles (β, α) de-
scribe the orientation of the R vector in space.

The monomer Hamiltonian used here for SH(X 2Π) is40

Hmon = b(ˆj − ˆl − ˆs)2 + Hso,

(4)

where the rotational constant b is 9.465 cm−1.29 For sim-
plicity the spin-orbit Hamiltonian Hso is taken to be in-
dependent of R and θ and equal to aλσ, with a = −378.5

The potential matrix elements are independent of J and
diagonal in P . Nevertheless, in a full treatment the wave-
functions of the complex are linear combinations of func-
tions with diﬀerent values of P , because the operator
( ˆJ − ˆ)2 in Eq. 1 has matrix elements oﬀ-diagonal in P
(∆P = ±1). However, the full wavefunctions are eigen-
functions of the parity operator: symmetrized basis func-
tions may be constructed by taking even and odd linear
combinations of ΦJM

jP ;λσ and ΦJM

j−P ;−λ−σ.

In the present work, the coupled equations are solved
using the BOUND program of Hutson.41 The wavefunc-
tion log-derivative matrix is propagated outwards from a
boundary point at short range (Rmin) and inwards from
a boundary point at long range (Rmax) to a matching
point (Rmid) in the classically allowed region. If E is an
eigenvalue of the Hamiltonian, the determinant of the dif-
ference between the two log-derivative matrices at Rmid
is zero.42,43 The BOUND program locates eigenvalues
by searching for zeroes of the lowest eigenvalue of the
matching determinant,43 using bisection followed by the
secant method. In the present work we use Rmin = 3.0 ˚A,
Rmax = 9.5 ˚A, Rmid = 4.2 ˚A and a log-derivative sector
size of 0.02 ˚A. The basis set includes all SH functions up
to jmax = 15/2 in both spin-orbit manifolds.

The energies obtained from full close-coupling calcula-
tions for the lowest few J = 3/2 levels of Ar–SH (actu-
ally carried out in the equivalent space-ﬁxed basis set1)
are shown in Table II. These levels all correlate with SH
2Π3/2, j = 3/2 and are labelled with the projection quan-
tum number P and Van der Waals stretching quantum
number n. We use the convention that levels in which

P and ω for the dominant basis functions have the same
sign are labelled with positive P and those where they
have diﬀerent sign are labelled with negative P .1 In or-
der of increasing energy, the lowest four levels for Ar–SH
have P = +3/2, +1/2, −3/2, −1/2, in contrast to Ar–
OH where the order is +3/2, +1/2, −1/2, −3/2.1,44 The
diﬀerence is due to the anisotropy of the sum potential
V0(R, θ): the ratio V20/V10 is larger for Ar–SH.

The close-coupling results may be compared with
the microwave experiments of Sumiyoshi et al. ,23 who
obtained a rotational constant Beﬀ = 1569.66 MHz
(0.05236 cm−1) and parity doubling constant qJ =
0.32873 MHz (1.10 × 10−5 cm−1) for the ground state
(P = +3/2). These correspond to a J = 3/2 − 5/2 sep-
aration of 0.262 cm−1 and a J = 3/2 parity splitting of
6.6×10−5 cm−1, which compare with calculated values of
0.263 cm−1 and 3.5 × 10−5 cm−1 respectively. The very
good agreement for the rotational spacing suggests that
the equilibrium distance of our ab initio potential is quite
accurate. The diﬀerence of almost a factor of 2 in the par-
ity splitting is less satisfactory, but Dubernet et al.45 have
shown that such terms involve complicated combinations
of high-order terms involving the diﬀerence potential,
spin uncoupling and Coriolis perturbations. Small dif-
ferences between the energies of excited states can have
a large eﬀect on the parity splitting. Sumiyoshi et al.25
have very recently measured microwave–millimetre-wave
double-resonance spectra of the P = +1/2 ← +3/2 band
of Ar–SH. The centre of gravity of the parity components
of the J = 3/2 ← 1/2 line is 81.8 GHz (2.73 cm−1). The
corresponding calculated quantity from our potential is
4.805 cm−1. In addition, the measured parity splitting
for the J = 3/2, P = +1/2 level is about 5300 MHz
(0.177 cm−1), which compares with 0.144 cm−1 from our
calculations. An interesting possibility for future work
would be to adjust the ab initio potential to improve the
ﬁt to the spectroscopic parameters using the morphing

procedure of Meuwly and Hutson.46

B. Wavefunctions

The full wavefunctions (Eq. 2) contain contributions
from all possible values of P and ω and are not separable
between the body-ﬁxed angles (θ, φ) and the space-ﬁxed
In
angles (β, α). This makes them hard to visualize.

addition, since the mixings depend on the total angu-
lar momentum J, they are not convenient for calculating
band intensities. We therefore introduce two approxi-
mations to simplify the description of the wavefunctions
for this purpose. First, we introduce the helicity decou-
pling approximation, where matrix elements of ( ˆJ − ˆ)2
oﬀ-diagonal in P are neglected. Secondly, we neglect ma-
trix elements of Hmon oﬀ-diagonal in σ (spin-uncoupling
terms). The coupled equations then simplify to

Since all matrix elements oﬀ-diagonal in P and σ have
been neglected, states with quantum numbers (P, ω) and
(−P, −ω) are uncoupled and it is not necessary to take
combinations of deﬁnite total parity. However, states
with (P, ω) and (−P, ω) or (P, −ω) have diﬀerent poten-
tial energies and are nondegenerate.

The energy levels obtained from helicity decoupling
calculations for Ar–SH are included in Table II. The
approximation is accurate to about 0.2 cm−1 for n = 0
and 1, but is less reliable for higher states. In particu-
lar, the region between −60 and −40 cm−1 contains both
j = 3/2, n = 2 and j = 5/2, n = 0 levels. In the pres-
ence of the resulting near-degeneracies, the terms that
are omitted in the approximate Hamiltonian can cause
quite signiﬁcant level shifts.

In the helicity decoupling approximation, P is a good
quantum number. However, ω is not because V2 mixes
levels with ∆λ = ±2 (but ∆σ = 0) and thus mixes ω =
+3/2 with −1/2 and ω = +1/2 with −3/2. However,
in the absence of terms oﬀ-diagonal in σ the two sets are
not mixed with one another. Each wavefunction thus has
only two components corresponding to diﬀerent values of
ω. The wavefunctions may be written

We have adapted the BOUND program41 to calcu-
late wavefunctions for this case by back-substituting into
the log-derivative propagation equations, as described
for the closed-shell (single surface) case by Thornley
and Hutson.47 Examples of the resulting wavefunctions
χJ
P n;ω(R, θ) are shown in Fig. 3. It may be seen that the
components for diﬀerent values of ω have quite diﬀerent
radial and angular distributions.

The Ar–SH wavefunctions are qualitatively similar to
those for Ne–SH obtained by Cybulski et al.37 Since the
potential anisotropy for Ar–SH is only a few tens of cm−1
in the well region, there is only weak mixing of SH ro-
tational functions with diﬀerent values of j. For this
reason the wavefunctions are dominated by the functions
d3/2
P ω (θ), as described by Dubernet and Hutson1 for the
case of Ar–OH. The d functions are shown, for example,
in Fig. 7 of ref. 1 and the angular parts of the wavefunc-
tions of Fig. 3 follow them quite closely.

C. Adiabatic approximations

In a basis set of Hund’s case (a) functions with signed
values of λ = ±1 and σ = ±1/2, we can deﬁne new adia-
batic surfaces (adiabats) including spin-orbit coupling as
eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian matrix at each value of R
and θ,

where again the spin-orbit Hamiltonian is taken to be
simply aλσ. This clearly factorizes into two equivalent
2 × 2 matrices, one containing ω = +3/2 and −1/2 and
the other containing ω = +1/2 and −3/2. The resulting
adiabats may be designated V+(R, θ) and V−(R, θ) with

where ϕω = ϕλϕσ. The adiabats for Ar–SH are shown
in Fig. 4. Since for Ar–SH V2(R, θ) is small compared to
a in the well region, the lower adiabat is always predom-
inantly ω = ±3/2 in character and the upper adiabat
is always predominantly ω = ∓1/2 in character. The
corresponding mixing angle αad is 0 at θ = 0 and 180◦
(where V2(R, θ) = 0) and less than 20◦ at other angles for
R > 3.5 ˚A. A contour plot of the mixing angle is shown
in Fig. 5.

A further consequence of the large spin-orbit coupling
constant is that both adiabats resemble the sum potential
V0(R, θ) much more than the A′ and A′′ potentials. The
spin-orbit coupling has in eﬀect quenched the splitting
between the A′ and A” states. This explains why there
is no tendency for the wavefunctions shown in Fig. 3 to
“fall into” the non-linear minimum of the A′ state.

The existence of adiabats including spin-orbit coupling
suggests a Born-Oppenheimer separation in which the
total wavefunctions are written approximately as

ΨiP n ≈ R−1ψi(R, θ)χiP n(R, θ),

(15)

where ψi is one of the functions of Eq. 14 and χin(R, θ)
is a solution of an eﬀective Schr¨odinger equation of the

However, the appropriate angular operator Hrot to use in
such a calculation is hard to deﬁne. The reduced rotation

This contains singularities at θ = 0 and/or 180◦ that de-
pend on the values of P and ω. However, there is no
single value of ω that is appropriate at all conﬁgurations.
The simplest approach is to replace ω in Eq. 17 with the
value that is appropriate at θ = 0 and 180◦ and solve
Eq. 16 in a basis set of d functions for each value of P .
This is equivalent to solving the coupled equations using
a basis set containing only functions with a single value
of ω. The results obtained with this approximation are
included in Table II: it may be seen that it gives energies

that are generally slightly too low (compared to the helic-
ity decoupling results), by 0.05 to 0.15 cm−1. A slightly
better but signiﬁcantly more complicated approximation
would be to replace ω with hωi and ω2 with hω2i in Eq.
17 to give an improved eﬀective potential.

One approach that is clearly not appropriate is to
carry out a bound-state calculation on a single adiabat
V±(R, θ) assuming that the SH molecule behaves as a
closed-shell rigid rotor. Such a calculation would give
substantially incorrect energies and wavefunctions.

It is in fact true that no wavefunction of the form (15)
can have the correct behavior near both linear geometries.
To see this, consider an alternative deﬁnition of the mix-
ing angle that can be obtained from a single wavefunction

angle is derived from the adiabats and is deﬁned in Eq. 14.

This quantity is plotted for n = 0 and all four P values
corresponding to j = 3/2 in Fig. 6. The mixing angles
for P = +3/2 and P = +1/2 bear some similarity to
αad(R, θ) (Fig. 5) at small θ, but tend to 90◦ instead
of zero at θ = 180◦. Conversely, the mixing angles for
P = −3/2 and P = −1/2 tend to 90◦ at θ = 0. This
is easy to explain in terms of the reduced rotation ma-
trices that appear in Eq. 12. For example, the functions
dj
±3/2,±3/2(θ) all behave as cos3(θ/2) as θ → 180◦, while
the functions dj
∓1/2,±3/2(θ) behave as cos(θ/2). This cor-
3/2,n → 90◦
responds to tan αJ
in that limit. The point here is that the component of
the P = +3/2 wavefunction on the ω = −1/2 surface
goes to zero more slowly than that on the ω = +3/2
surface as θ → 180◦. Fig. 5 shows that the coupled-
channel wavefunctions (10) for P = +3/2 and +1/2 are
predominantly in the ω = −1/2 state near θ = 180◦,
which corresponds to the upper adiabat rather than the
lower one. The P = −3/2 and −1/2 wavefunctions show
similar behavior around θ = 0. This is not the behavior
implied by Eq. 15.

IV. ELECTRONIC SPECTRUM CALCULATION

A. Transition wavenumbers

In order to calculate the line positions in the vibra-
tionally resolved A 2Σ+ ← X 2Π electronic spectrum,
we require the bound-state energies for the excited elec-
tronic state, as well as those for the ground state. For

angle αad (thick black line) with angles obtained from wave-
functions correlating with j = 3/2, ω = +3/2 for P = +3/2

(black). The mixing angles are shown as cuts through the
corresponding surfaces taken at R = 3.9 ˚A.

the A 2Σ+ state we make use of the recent PES presented
by Hirst et al.22 This surface has a global minimum of
−742.5 cm−1 at the linear Ar–H-S conformation (θ = 0◦),
and a secondary minimum of −673.7 cm−1 for linear Ar–
S-H (θ = 180◦). The two minima are separated by a
barrier more than 600 cm−1 high and the lowest-energy
vibrational levels are localised within one or other of the
two wells.

The bound states of this PES have been analysed
previously22 and only a brief discussion is given here.
Bound-state energies were calculated as eigenvalues of
the spin-free triatomic Hamiltonian in Jacobi coordi-
nates. Discrete variable representations (DVRs) were
employed for both the intermolecular distance R and the
angle θ. For R, 120 sinc-DVR functions48 were used, with
DVR points ranging from 2.5 ˚A to 8.5 ˚A. For θ, a 64-point
DVR based on Legendre polynomials was used. With this
basis set, the bound levels of interest were converged to at
least seven signiﬁcant ﬁgures. The resulting levels are la-
beled by quantum numbers (vSH, bK, n), where vSH and n
are quantum numbers for the SH stretch and the atom–
diatom stretch respectively. K is the projection of the
total angular momentum of the diatom, neglecting spin,
onto the body-ﬁxed z-axis, and b is the number of nodes
in the intermolecular angle θ. The resulting energies for
levels with total angular momentum N = 0 (neglecting
spin) are in precise agreement with previous results.22 To

facilitate the calculation of band intensities, for N = 1
the helicity decoupled approximation was employed, in
which the Coriolis terms coupling diﬀerent K-levels are
ignored. The helicity-decoupled energies are within 0.5
cm−1 of the full close-coupled results.22

For the purpose of calculating transition frequencies,
the asymptotic separation of the potentials is taken to be
the experimental excitation energy from the v = 0, j =
3/2 level of the 2Π3/2 state to the lowest v = 0, j = 1/2
level of the 2Σ+ state of isolated SH, which is 30832.68
cm−1.49 All transitions of the complex were assumed to
originate from the P = +3/2 level of Ar–SH (2Π). The
lowest-energy transition frequency for the complex is cal-
culated to be 30488.5 cm−1, which is 31.5 cm−1 greater
than the experimental value of 30457 cm−1.20 This agree-
ment is reasonable, considering the level of theory used
in the calculation of the potentials.

B. Transition dipole moments

Calculations of spectroscopic intensities require tran-
tot, where

sition dipole moments µif

tot = hi|µel|fi .

(19)

The integrals involve the initial (i) and ﬁnal (f) wave-
functions as determined from bound-state calculations.
In this work we evaluated transition dipoles over internal
coordinates (R, θ), neglecting overall rotation. This gives
transition dipoles that correspond to band intensities be-
tween intermolecular vibrational states. The electronic
dipole moment, µel, is in general a parametric function
of the nuclear coordinates.
In the body-ﬁxed frame it
may be expanded in terms of reduced rotation matrices,

In this work it is

assumed that µel consists purely of contributions from
the SH monomer, so that only j = 1 contributes in Eq.
20 and the coeﬃcients µ∆λ
el,j are independent of R. Since
we are dealing with a perpendicular transition in SH,
∆λ = ±1. The transition dipoles were calculated as one-
dimensional Gaussian quadratures in θ, then integrated
over R.

C.

Intensities and lifetime factors

The signals in a pulsed-laser ﬂuorescence excitation ex-
periment decay exponentially following each pulse, with
a lifetime equal to that of the excited state being probed.
Intensities are typically measured as the area under the
decay curve, and so the experimental intensities are pro-
portional to the lifetime of the excited state. Ar–SH is

9

somewhat unusual in the large range of lifetimes exhib-
ited by diﬀerent vibrational levels in the A state.
It
is known that the presence of the Ar atom blocks the
electronic predissociation of the SH radical, leading to a
greatly increased lifetime of up to 600 ns for low-lying
bound levels, compared to ∼ 1 ns for the uncomplexed
species.20,50 However, the actual lifetime depends on the
degree of vibrational excitation, and lifetimes speciﬁc to
particular levels have been calculated by McCoy.50

The top panel of Fig. 7 shows a spectrum calculated
directly from the squares of transition dipoles, while the
center panel shows a spectrum in which the intensities
have been multiplied by McCoy’s lifetime values. Clearly
this is possible only for levels for which lifetime data exist,
and transitions to other levels are omitted in the center
panel (i.e., it is assumed that their lifetimes are small).
Also shown is an experimental spectrum from Ref. 20.
The spacings between the peaks in the calculated Ar–SH
spectrum are consistently ∼ 5% smaller than in experi-
ment. It is clear that the intensity distributions are sig-
niﬁcantly diﬀerent in the two calculated spectra, and that
the one that includes lifetime factors gives considerably
better agreement with experiment. The agreement in
intensities is quite good, especially considering that the
experimental spectrum was most likely not normalised
for dye laser power.51 From our results it seems likely
that the small peak at ∼ 30810 cm−1 in the experimental
spectrum can be assigned to the transition to (0, 00, 6).
Even without the lifetime weighting, transitions to lev-
els localized in the θ = 180◦ well of the A state, which
are labelled with + symbols in Fig. 7, are weak in the
simulated spectrum. This arises because of poor overlap
with the P = +3/2 ground-state wavefunction (which is
concentrated around θ = 0). In addition, it is likely that
such levels have short lifetimes close to that of uncom-
plexed SH22 and so will have even lower intensities in the
ﬂuorescence excitation spectrum. These levels have not
been observed experimentally to our knowledge.

V. SUMMARY

We have obtained new ab initio potential energy sur-
faces for the Ar–SH complex in its ground 2Π electronic
state and used them to calculate bound-state energies
and wavefunctions using coupled-channel methods. We
have also described a new adiabatic approximation that
includes spin-orbit coupling and can be used to calculate
bound states on a single potential energy surface. How-
ever, the adiabatic wavefunctions fail to reproduce some
features of the true wavefunctions. We have used our re-
sults to simulate the vibrationally resolved laser-induced
ﬂuorescence excitation spectrum of Ar–SH, with intensi-
ties modelled using calculated transition dipole moments
and calculated lifetimes. The inclusion of the lifetime
factor is important to obtain satisfactory agreement with
the experimental intensities.

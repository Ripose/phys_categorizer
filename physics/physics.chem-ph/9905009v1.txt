This paper presents an analysis of the motion of an impurity ion in a nanometer scale
He cluster.
Due to induction forces, ions are strongly localized near the center of the cluster, with a root
mean squared thermal displacements of only a few ˚A. The trapping potential is found to be nearly
harmonic, with a frequency of 2.3(1.0) GHz for a positive (negative) ion in a He cluster of radius
5 nm. The anharmonicity is small and positive (energy increases slightly faster than linear with
quantum number). It is suggested that by using frequency sweep microwave radiation, it should be
possible to drive the ion center of mass motion up to high quantum numbers, allowing the study of
the critical velocity as a function of cluster size.

I. INTRODUCTION

The last few years have seen dramatic advances in the
spectroscopy of atoms and molecules attached to large He
clusters [1]. These clusters provide a unique environment
for a spectroscopy which combines many of the attractive
features of both high resolution gas phase spectroscopy
and traditional matrix spectroscopy [2]. These include
the ability to obtain rotationally resolved spectra of even
very large molecules [3], and the ability to form and sta-
bilize extremely fragile species [4], including high spin
states of molecules.

Despite rapid progress, many fundamental questions
remain about spectroscopy in this environment. One
important topic that has received little attention is the
dynamics of the center of mass motion of an impurity
in a 4He cluster [5]. A recent experiment reported by
Grebenev, Toennies, and Vilesov [6] has convincingly
demonstrated that these clusters are superﬂuid. Thus
we expect that an impurity, like in bulk superﬂuid He,
should be able to move with little or no friction as long
as its velocity stays below a ‘critical velocity’ which is
found to be on the order of 30 m/s for motion of positive
ions in bulk superﬂuid 4He [7,8]. Doped He clusters pro-
vide an attractive system to study the size dependence
of superﬂuid hydrodynamics.

There have been several theoretical studies reported
that consider the motion of an electron bound to the
surface of He or other dielectric clusters [9–14]. Most of
these have only considered the electrostatic potential for
the ion outside of the cluster, and solved for the quantum
levels of the electron, including determining the minimum
size for a cluster to bound an electron. The only excep-
tions in the open literature known to the authors is the
work of Antoniewicz et al. [10,11] that presents the elec-
trostatic potential inside the cluster, but the potential
given in that work is in error by a factor of two, and a
paper by Northby, Kim and Jiang [15] that presents an
approximate potential, similar to that given in section 2
below, but without any derivation. The exact electro-

static expressions have been given in the Ph.D. thesis of
Ballester [16] and Kim [17].

This paper will present a realistic potential for the mo-
tion of an ion in a He cluster, based upon the electrostatic
potential produced by the dielectric response of the He
to the ion. Similar response is partly responsible for the
trapping potential of an ion beneath a He–vapor inter-
face that was exploited by Poitrenaud and Williams [18]
to determine the eﬀective mass of positive and negative
charge carriers in bulk He. This paper will then propose
experiments that can be viewed as the natural extension
of this earlier work on bulk He. In addition to allowing
the determination of the size dependence of the eﬀective
mass of ions, it should also allow for the study of the
eﬀective size dependence of critical velocity of ion in the
cluster.

In a following paper, the motion of a neutral impu-
rity atom or molecule will be considered, and an eﬀective
Hamiltonian for its motion, including both long range po-
tential and hydrodynamic contributions, will be derived.
The potential localizes the neutral impurity near the cen-
ter of the cluster, though much more weakly than for the
case of an ion which has much stronger long range in-
teractions with the He, falling as r−4 versus r−6. In the
case of molecules, there is a coupling of the rotation and
the center of mass motion which leads to a broadening
mechanism in the rotational or ro–vibrational spectrum.

II. POTENTIAL FOR AN ION IN A HE
DROPLET

A large fraction of the studies of impurities in He clus-
ters have exploited mass spectrometry [19–21]. The mi-
gration of the charge in a cluster (which is most likely
initially localized on a He atom) will be inﬂuenced by
the eﬀective potential of such a charge [22]. By electro-
statics, the charge will be most stable at the center of
the cluster, furthest from the polarization charge that
will develop on the cluster surface, due to the dielectric

1

constant of He. The purpose of this section is to derive
an expression for this potential and explore some of its
predicted consequences. This potential does not include
the energy of solvation of the He around the impurity.

Assume that we have an ion of unit charge, e, at a ra-
dius a from the center of droplet, and pick the coordinate
system such that the z axis is along the displacement of
the ion from the center.
In order to calculate the en-
ergy, we can sum up the ion induced dipole interaction
of the ion with the ‘missing’ He that would be ‘outside’
the droplet. This makes the ‘zero’ of energy an ion in an
inﬁnite bulk of liquid He, and also avoids the diﬃculties
with the nearby He atoms which are strongly bound to
the ion.

Let r(θ) be the distance from the ion to the droplet
surface at a polar angle θ measured from the ion. Basic
trigonometry gives:

R2 = (a + r cos(θ))2 + r2 sin(θ)2 = a2 + r2 + 2ra cos(θ)

from which we can derive:

r(θ) =

R2 − a2 sin(θ)2 − a cos(θ)

The ﬁeld from a charge is given by:

E(r) =

4 π ǫ r2

This leads to an energy diﬀerence from the bulk:

where ρ is the number density of He (0.0218 ˚A

In this paper, we will consistently use y for the reduced or
fractional radius of the impurity ion or molecule. Using
the relationships between the polarizablity, the electric
susceptibility χ, and the relative dielectric constant ǫr:
ρα = ǫ0χ for χ ≪ 1, χ = ǫr − 1, and ǫ = ǫrǫ0 [25], we
can write this as:

∆E =

e2
4πǫ0R

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

ǫr − 1
2ǫ2
r

F0(a/R)

As the ion approaches the surface of the cluster (i. e. y →
1), the ﬁrst term in the expression for F0(y) dominates. It
is easily shown that for ǫr ≈ 1 and as y → 1, the potential
becomes the same as the ‘image charge’ potential for an
ion approaching a planar He–vacuum interface from the
Helium side [18]. For liquid He at 3 K, ǫr = 1.05646 [26].
If we take R = 5 nm (which corresponds to ∼ 11, 500 He
atoms), the prefactor in the equation for ∆E/hc = 62
cm−1. If we compare the energy of an ion at the center
of the cluster, y = 0, with one near the edge y = 0.90, we
get a wavenumber diﬀerence of 151 cm−1, which is very
large compared to kb Tc/hc = 0.26 cm−1 for a 4He clus-
ter at Tc = 0.38 K. Spectroscopic studies of a number
of impurities have demonstrated that He clusters main-
tain themselves, by evaporation, at a temperature close
to this value [27,3], as had previously been predicted [23].
This potential means that an ion will be strongly pushed
towards the center of the cluster. Once in the center of
the cluster, the thermal motion should produce a Gaus-
sian distribution with RMS displacement of only 0.5 nm.
This can be compared to the size of the ‘snowball’ of
frozen He around a positive ion, which is known to have
a radius of ≈ 0.6 nm [28]. Electrons in He form a ‘bub-
ble’ with a radius of ≈ 1.7 nm [28]. The mechanism and
thus time scale for equilibration of an impurity center of
mass motion with the internal motion of the He cluster
is presently unknown, but most likely involves exchange
of energy and angular momentum with quantized sur-
face capillary waves, known as ripplons, as these are the
only He cluster modes thermally excited at this temper-
ature [23].

This treatment of the eﬀective potential for an ionic
impurity leaves out the interaction between the induced
moments created by the charge. As long as one works
in linear response theory, and one can treat the He as a
continuum, then these eﬀects can be included by a clas-
sical electrostatic calculation, which are presented in an
appendix. Because the relative dielectric constant, ǫr, is
so close to one for liquid He, this more exact treatment is
in excellent agreement with the more approximate treat-
ment given above. This supports not only the neglect of
three body eﬀects for the present case of an ionic impu-
rity, but also for the neutral impurities to be considered
in a latter paper.

A. Proposed Experiments

Let us consider an ion in a He cluster of R = 5. Taylor
expansion of the potential (Eq. 19) around the center of
the cluster gives a harmonic force constant of

R2 = 6.5 · 10−5 N (9)

If we assume an eﬀective mass of 45 times the mass
of 4He, which was found in bulk He for positive ion
mobility [18], we get an eﬀective vibrational frequency

ν = 2.3 GHz. The dimensionless length corresponding to
this vibration is 1.6 ˚A. The vibrational transition mo-
ment for the n = 0 → 1 transition is µ01 = 5.2 Debye.
The zero point level corresponds to a root mean squared
(RMS) velocity of 3.8 ms−1. It will require 90 quanta of
vibration to reach a velocity of 30m s−1, which is near the
critical value for the onset of dissipation in bulk super-
ﬂuid He [7,8]. Vibration around the center has a positive
anharmonicity with x = 6.4 · 10−4. This implies that
the 89 → 90 vibrational transition will be blue shifted
by ≈ 11%. Even for this high level of excitation, the
classical turning point for the vibration is ≈ 1.5 nm, and
thus the ion will remain localized close to the center of
the cluster, and thus away from the surface, where the
approximations made in this paper are expected to break
down.

This suggests the following experiment to measure the
cluster size dependence of the critical velocity. For ion
motion with a peak classical value below the critical ve-
locity, one expects little damping of the vibrational mo-
tion. Thus, excitation of the vibrational transition should
have little or no observable eﬀects. However, once the vi-
brational velocity of the ion exceeds the critical velocity,
the motion will become strongly damped and the cluster
will continue to absorb energy from a microwave ﬁeld.
This will lead to evaporation of He atoms which can be
detected by a mass selected and mass analyzed beam. By
chirping the microwave frequency, one can exploit the an-
harmonicity to produce an almost pure number state of
the motion, at least before damping becomes important,
with the level of excitation determined by end point of
the chirp. It is easily veriﬁed that due to the large tran-
sition dipole moments, only modest microwave power is
required to drive the ion up to high levels of excitation.
The motion of positive ions in bulk He is associated with
vortex rings, which have the curious property that their
velocity is inversely proportional to their energy [7]. The
eﬀect of conﬁning the ion in a nanoscale He cluster could
dramatically alter the dynamics of ion motion.

Even below the critical velocity, one may expect some
coupling between the motion of the ionic impurity and
the internal degrees of freedom of the He cluster, par-
ticularly the surface ripplons, which are low frequency
motions. Using the methods described in the paper that
follows this one, on the potential of a neutral impurity
in a large He cluster, it is possible to estimate the size of
the coupling of the ionic motion to the ripplons. These
couplings will be expected to cause perturbations of the
frequency of center of mass motion of the ion as a function
of excitation level and/or cluster size, as the ion motion
and ripplons pass through resonance conditions. It is eas-
ily seen that the lowest order in the interaction energy
between the ion displacement, a, and a displacement of
a ripplon of angular momentum L, S(L), is proportional
to:

Hripplon,ion ≈

This and higher order coupling terms will allow energy to
ﬂow from the ion motion to the ripplons. Energy in the
ripplons, in turn, can lead to evaporation and observable
reduction in the size of a mass selected cluster. Such
experiments could provide the ﬁrst measurements of the
excitation levels of nanometer scale He clusters.

Another potential experiment is to examine the reso-
nances of electrons in He clusters. Such solvated elec-
trons are metastable, and the electrons will eventually
be expelled from the cluster [29]. Kim, Yurgenson and
Northby [30] have observed by spontaneous and infrared
induced electron detachments from large He clusters sev-
eral milliseconds after formation. The stability of such
charged clusters to electric ﬁelds demonstrates that the
electrons are in bubble states of the He cluster, not at-
tached as surface states [31]. Excitation of the center
of mass motion of these ‘bubble states’ should result in a
dramatic increase in the rate of electron evaporation from
the cluster. The potential for the negatively charged bub-
ble should be the same as for a positive ion, as long as the
center of the bubble is further from the surface than its
radius, ≈ 1.7 nm. The primary diﬀerence of the bubble
compared to the positive ion is that the eﬀective mass
is ≈ 243 times the mass of 4He [32], which means that
for a 5 nm cluster, the harmonic vibrational frequency
is ≈ 1 GHz. Since the Harmonic vibrational frequency
is proportional to the inverse square root of the cluster
radius, it should be possible to selectively neutralize all
clusters below a certain size by sweeping the microwave
ﬁeld from a certain frequency to higher values. By us-
ing microwave double resonance experiments, it should
be possible to determine the homogeneous width of the
resonance, and thus any drag that the electron bubble
inside the cluster may experience.

III. SUMMARY

This paper has developed the potential that governs
the motion of an ion inside a nm scale He cluster. This
motion is determined by long range electrostatic interac-
tions, and thus can be calculated without having to deal
with the much more diﬃcult problem of the energetics of
solvation of the ion in liquid He. It is found that despite
the small dielectric constant of He, the potential is very
eﬀective at driving the impurity ion into the center of
the cluster. In thermal equilibrium, RMS displacements
of only a few ˚A are expected.

After ionization by electron impact, the He ion under-
goes a ‘random walk’ due to charge exchange with other
He atoms until it becomes localized as a He+
2 core which
is then solvated [33]. The electrostatic potential derived
here will strongly bias this ‘random walk’, given the low
temperatures of the clusters [22]. Such a bias could be
expected to eﬀect the dynamics following ionization, in-
cluding the probability of charge exchange with an im-
purity, which will also likely be localized near the center

of the cluster.

The trapping potential of an ion is found to be highly
harmonic, with a frequency in the low microwave region,
and having very large transition dipole moments. Exper-
iments are suggested that would exploit these resonances,
and the ability to drive the ion up to high quantum states
by an adiabatically sweep microwave pulse.

APPENDIX: EXACT ELECTROSTATIC
TREATMENT FOR ION IN HE CLUSTER

In this appendix, the classical electrostatic energy that
determines the motion of an ion inside a He cluster will be
derived, modeling the He cluster as a dielectric sphere.
Given the errors in the previous open literature, it is
important that the expressions given below be justiﬁed.
Further, comparison of the exact and approximate energy
expression given by Eq. 8 is important since it allows for
an estimate to be made of the approximations used in
the companion paper for the energy of neutral impurities
in He, where a treatment including many body eﬀects is
not practical.

Outside of the cluster, we must satisfy Laplaces equa-
tion and we must have only terms which go to zero at
inﬁnity. Thus:

Vo(r, θ) =

Bnr−(n+1)Pn(cos θ)

(11)

∞

n=0
X

Inside the cluster, we have a ﬁeld due to a point charge
(screened by the dielectric) plus ﬁelds due to surface
charges. The ﬁeld of the later must also satisfy Laplaces
equation, but with positive powers:

We can determine An and Bn by satisfying the bound-
ary conditions Vo(R, θ) = Vi(R, θ) and ǫoEo,r = ǫEi,r.
For these equations to hold for all θ, the respective co-
eﬃcients of each Pn must be equal. This leads to the
following expressions:

We can now calculate the electrostatic energy by using

where ρ(x) = eδ(~x − ~a) is the free charge density. Since
our reference energy is that of a point charge in an inﬁnite

potential. This gives:

This potential is exactly one half that previously reported
by Antoniewicz et al. [10,11]. These authors reference a
classic text [34] for their expression, but unfortunately,
the present authors could not locate a copy of this book.
In the limit that ǫr → 1, Eq. 19 agrees exactly with the
Taylor expansion of the expression given above (Eq. 5)
for the energy obtained by ‘adding up’ the ion–induced
dipole energy contributions. Since this earlier expression
correctly gives the correct planer ‘image charge’ poten-
tial as y → 1, it cannot be in error by a factor of two,
and thus the error must lie with the expression given
by Antoniewicz, Ballester et al. The Ph.D. thesis of
Ballester [16] gives the correct power series expression
without the factor of two error. The correct expression
was also given in the Ph.D. thesis of Kim [17], who cor-
rected some other minor errors in Ballester’s expressions.
For the case of He clusters, if the ﬁnal sum is dropped
in Eq. 19, the resulting approximation is in error by at
most few percent over the range 0 < y < 0.9. In this same
range of y, Eq. 8 agrees with Eq. 19 even better, with
error of less than 1%. Thus the fractional error of the
approximate treatment that neglects many body eﬀects

4

is considerably smaller than might have been predicted
a priori, ≈ (ǫr − 1).

The power series expansion for W (Eq. 19) is com-
putationally useful for small y values (say ≤ 0.5), but
convergence slows dramatically as y → 1, since the real
solution diverges in that limit. By reference to the form
of the correct solution in the limit of ǫr ≈ 1 (Eq. 5), it is
possible to subtract out the power series of the divergent
parts of the solution. The resulting expression is:

W =

In this form, the fact that W goes exactly into Eq. 5 in
the limit ǫr → 1 is transparent. Further, the last sum is
convergent, even at y = 1, though the convergence is slow
there. However, in the region of slow convergence, the
sum makes a negligible contribution to the total energy.
Further, if the sum is truncated at the n = N − 1 term,
the remainder of the sum can be approximated by an

Ballester [16] suggests using the method known as

series. Kim [17] derived a similar closed form expression
for the interaction energy by a diﬀerent method.

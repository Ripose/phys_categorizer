Abstract

When developing and assessing density functional theory methods, a ﬁnite basis set is usually

employed. In most cases, however, the issue of basis set dependency is neglected. Here, we assess

several basis sets and functionals. In addition, the dependency of the semiempirical ﬁts to a given

basis set for a generalised gradient approximation and a hybrid functional is investigated. The

resulting functionals are then tested for other basis sets, evaluating their errors and transferability.

INTRODUCTION

In the past years, Density Functional Theory (DFT) has become a very im-

portant approach for computational quantum chemistry.

The Kohn-Sham imple-

mentation of DFT critically depends on the quality of

the exchange-correlation

functional

for

its

success.

Recently, various

second-generation functionals

(such

as PBE[1],mPW91[2],VSXC[3], PBE0[4],PKZB[5],HCTH/93 and B97-1[6],HCTH/120[7],

HCTH/407[8], OPTX[9],B972[10],τ -HCTH and its hybrid[11],mPW1K[12],B97[13], and

B98[14]) have been developed. These add to the numerous functionals that are already

available and commonly used in standard program packages (such as B88X[15], B3P91 and

B3LYP[16],VWN[17],P86[18],LYP[19],P91X[20], and P91c[21]). All of the functionals were

developed from a wide variety of considerations, with most of them focused on the exchange-

correlation hole and employing diﬀerent philosophies in their approximations.

Usually, after deciding upon the mathematical form of the functional, its parameters

have to be obtained. The latter is a diﬃcult process where diﬀerent routes can be followed.

Some of these functionals only use parameters that were determined by considering known

boundary conditions that the functional or density should obey, and for properties of certain

idealised systems like the uniform electron gas [1, 2, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21]; hence their parameters

are mainly determined by physical properties. The majority of commonly used functionals

have been determined by ﬁtting at least one of their parameters to atomic or molecular

data. A number of the latter functionals have been generated using numerical DFT (i.e.

basis set-free) methods [13, 14, 15, 16] in their ﬁts (although they in principle introduce

numerical noise), but most of the functionals have been ﬁt to molecular sets with limited

basis sets, usually of triple-zeta[3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11] or even double-zeta[12] quality.

Many DFT users are thus overwhelmed by the sheer number of functionals and possibil-

ities that can be used, whereas with ab initio methods, the choices are clearly deﬁned and

mainly determined by a trade-oﬀ between rigor and computational cost. Very often because

of sheer user inertia, ﬁrst-generation functionals are applied rather than the more accurate

second-generation functionals. Generally, a basis set of double- or triple-zeta quality is ap-

plied. Meanwhile, systematic studies on the dependency of the basis set and functionals

remain sparse [22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28]. In addition, it is not a priori clear that basis sets

optimised for wavefunction ab initio methods are the most optimal choice of DFT. Recently,

2

new basis sets especially optimised for DFT [29, 30, 31, 32] have been proposed. However,

we have to keep in mind that in these cases the basis sets have been optimised for speciﬁc

functionals, like BLYP[29, 30] or the Local Spin Density Approximation (LSDA) [31, 32],

further adding to the confusion. In sum, we have a plethora of functionals developed for

speciﬁc basis sets and additionally, a variety of basis sets developed for speciﬁc functionals.

In the former case, the question arises which basis sets can and should be used for developing

new functionals, and which basis set should then be employed when applying them. This

is a major consideration in functional development, since the question remains: with which

basis set the error of the basis set becomes comparable to that of the functional? Even if

part of the basis set error is absorbed into the parameters of the functional, the question

remains of how transferable such a functional will be to other basis sets- be they further

from, or nearer to the inﬁnite basis set limit.

In this contribution, we will evaluate and compare various functionals using basis sets of

double-zeta sp to quadruple-zeta spdfg quality. In addition, we will ﬁt a functional, in this

case the Hamprecht-Cohen-Tozer-Handy (HCTH) functional [6], to slightly modiﬁed G2-

1[33] and G3 sets of molecules[34]. These sets are denoted as the 147 [7] and 407 Sets [35].

All these ﬁts will be carried out for several basis sets of double-zeta, triple- and quadruple-

zeta quality. The same ﬁtting procedure was employed for the functional [6, 7, 8, 36] using

the TZ2P basis set.

HCTH is a post-local spin density approximation (post- LSDA) functional, meaning that

it factorises the LSDA functional forms (FLSDA), which can be found elsewhere [37]:

The three summations correspond to errors of the energies, gradients and exchange-

correlation potentials of each molecule, respectively. In all cases, K-S denotes the calculated

property; hence we have the energy diﬀerence between the exact and calculated energy in

the ﬁrst sum. In the second sum the exact gradients (at equilibrium geometry) should be

zero.

In the ﬁnal term, we ﬁt to the exchange-correlation potentials determined by the

Zhao-Morrison-Parr method [38] from high-level ab initio densities, which are shifted by a

constant k because of the eﬀects of the quantum-mechanical integer discontinuity. All these

contributions need to be weighted by appropriate weights w, which have been determined

and reported in previous papers [8]. The weights w consist of several factorised weights

making contributions for each molecule in order to ensure a balanced functional.

In the next section, we will reﬁt the HCTH generalised gradient approximation (GGA)

functional to numerous basis sets.

In addition, we will assess the performance of these

functionals with basis sets other than those used for the parameterisation.

In the third

section we will apply the same procedure to hybrid functionals, focusing on the amount of

exact exchange needed for those functionals depending on the basis set. In the last section,

we will assess several functionals with two triple-zeta basis sets (namely, TZ2P[39] and

cc-pVTZ[40, 41]).

II. GGA FUNCTIONALS AND BASIS SETS

For all calculations, we used the Cadpac suite of programs [42], using a standard ’high’

grid for the density functional calculations.

In the basis set evaluation, we used the 3-

21G[43, 44], 6-31G[45, 46], 6-311G[47, 48] (the latter two with various combinations of

diﬀuse and polarisation functions), DZP, TZ2P[39], DFO[32], cc-pVDZ, aug-cc-pVDZ, cc-

pVTZ, aug-cc-pVTZ and cc-pVQZ basis sets[40, 41]. Some of the basis sets speciﬁcally

constructed for density functionals discussed in the introduction are not available (yet) for

second-row atoms [29, 30, 31] and thus could not be used.

4

In Table I, we compare the performance of the functionals with the basis set with which

they were ﬁt. HCTH/147@3-21G, for example, denotes an HCTH functional ﬁtted to the

147 set with a 3-21G basis set. The ﬁrst column contains the RMS energy error of the

functional for the atomisation and dissociation energies, electron aﬃnities, proton aﬃnities,

and ionisation potentials in the 147 Set. The second column displays the sum of all the

gradients calculated at the equilibrium geometry in atomic units. The gradients have been

shown to correlate with the accuracy of the bond distances and angles obtained[8, 11]. The

third column is the square of all the errors in the exchange-correlation potential contribu-

tions. All three errors are actually ﬁtted according to equation 4. In the fourth column, we

evaluate Q, which is the sum of all three weighted errors with uniform weights rather than

Ω:

Since all three contributions are important and the GGA functionals have been ﬁt to a value

similar to Q, it is probably the most important diagnostic. Nevertheless, as only the ﬁrst

two sums are directly apparent from the energy calculations, we also evaluate Q1, which

excludes the potential:

We have to bear in mind that both the “exact” exchange-correlation potentials and densities

were calculated using the TZ2P basis set. This, however, does not necessarily imply that

the HCTH/147@TZ2P functional has a distinct advantage when we ﬁt to these quantities

since basis set convergence with angular momentum is much slower in ab initio methods

than for density functionals. Nevertheless, the density calculations using the Brueckner

Doubles method include core correlation. This might suggest that the TZ2P basis set has a

slight advantage over the other basis sets when ﬁtting it to ZMP potentials that have been

obtained from BD densities[49]. Unlike the cc-pVTZ and 6-311G basis sets, the TZ2P basis

set is of triple-zeta quality in the inner-shell orbitals.

Ignoring for the moment the Pople basis sets that just diﬀer in the polarisation component

on the hydrogen, the following ordering of HCTH/147@ in Q is observed:

5

TZ2P < 6-311+G(3df,2pd) ≈ 6-311+G(3d,2p) ≈ aug-cc-pVTZ ≈ cc-pVQZ ≈ 6-

311+G(2d,2p) < cc-pVTZ < 6-311G(2d,p) ≪ DFO2

All basis sets are ordered by their errors (unlike Table I), with < and ≪ corresponding

to a diﬀerence of more than 5% or 20% between the functionals, respectively. From Table

I, the HCTH/147@TZ2P functional clearly yields the best overall results. The Pople large

basis sets also exhibit surprisingly low errors, although some polarisation and diﬀuse func-

tions are needed to achieve this performance. Interestingly, Dunning’s correlation consistent

basis sets, which were optimised at the CISD level, show high errors despite having more

basis functions. Even at the quadruple-zeta level, this “basis set functional” yields higher

errors than both HCTH/147@TZ2P and HCTH/147@6-311+G(3d,2p). HCTH/147@DFO2,

whose basis set was developed speciﬁcally for density functionals, shows an extraordinarily

poor performance, probably due to built-in constraint of DFO2 that the diﬀerent angular

momentum functions share the same exponents.

When excluding the potentials at the triple-zeta level, Q changes to Q1, and the ordering

of HCTH/147@basis set becomes:

6-311+G(3df,2pd) ≈ 6-311+G(3d,2p) < cc-pVQZ ≈ TZ2P ≈ 6-311+G(2d,2p) < aug-cc-

pVTZ ≈ cc-pVTZ < 6-311G(2d,p) ≪ DFO2

Here, the HCTH/147@TZ2P functional exhibits a somewhat higher error compared to

the HCTH/147@6-311+G(3d,2p) functionals for Q1, yet still has an error comparable to

the only quadruple-zeta basis set tested, HCTH/147@cc-pVQZ. The latter basis sets yield

only slightly lower errors than when ﬁtting to a TZ2P basis. For the double-zeta quality

basis sets, the energies and gradients have much larger error contributions to Q than the

potentials, hence the exclusion of the latter has no impact on the ordering in the HCTH/147@

functionals:

6-31+G(2d,p) < 6-31+G** < DFO1 ≈ 6-31G(2d,p) < aug-cc-pVDZ < 6-31G** < 6-31G*

< DZP ≪ cc-pVDZ <<< 6-31G <<< 3-21G

As for the double-zeta basis sets, the unpolarised basis sets are clearly not very useful

for the purpose. HCTH/147@DFO1 and the functionals ﬁtted to the Pople basis sets yield

the lowest errors. The former should not be surprising as it was developed speciﬁcally for

DFT whereas the Pople basis sets were developed for Hartree-Fock. Nevertheless, with

the exception of the HCTH/147@6-31+G(2d,p) functional, the double-zeta “basis set func-

tionals” yield much higher errors than those obtained by the triple-zeta quality basis sets.

6

Hence, if computationally feasible, basis sets of triple-zeta quality are preferable over basis

sets of double-zeta quality when doing calculations employing DFT. Overall, and consistent

with earlier observations made by Jensen [30], Dunning’s basis sets do not seem to be an

optimal choice for density functional calculations. On the other hand, diﬀuse functions are

more important with the Pople basis sets, in that they provide a signiﬁcant error reduc-

tion. A detailed analysis of the results shows that predominantly the total atom energies,

atomisation energies and electron aﬃnities of anions are aﬀected, with the error for the

latter increasing by more than a factor of two when omitting diﬀuse functions. In compar-

ison, with the HCTH/147@cc-pVTZ functional the error of the atomisation energies and

ionisation potentials of the anions decreases by less than 20% when diﬀuse functions are

included in the basis set. This is a general indication that despite their limited usefulness

for DFT, Dunning’s basis sets are more “balanced” than the 6-31 family of basis sets with

respect to diﬀuse functions. The HCTH/147@TZ2P functional yields a similar error as the

HCTH/147@cc-pVTZ basis set for the anions, suggesting that diﬀuse functions might reduce

its error further. Changing the basis functions on the hydrogen atom, as has been suggested

in a prior assessment of diﬀerent density functionals [50, 51], worsened the performance of

the HCTH/147@TZ2P “basis set functional” in all tests.

Having obtained a number of functionals, comparing their coeﬃcients in Table II yields

further insight. Here, only the HCTH/147@3-21G functional obtained from ﬁtting to

the split-valence 3-21G basis set diﬀers blatantly from the other functionals. Both the

HCTH/147@DZP and HCTH/147@aug-cc-pVDZ functionals have large zeroth-order like-

spin correlation coeﬃcients (cCσσ,0) probably thus compensating for the basis set error. Note

that this coeﬃcient also increases when going to larger molecules [8]. The HCTH/147@6-

31+G** coeﬃcients are closer to the ones obtained by the triple-zeta basis sets than the other

double-zeta quality “basis set functionals”, conﬁrming its lower basis set error. No clear con-

clusions on this eﬀect can be made with the triple- and quadruple-zeta functionals, since both

the HCTH/147@TZ2P (including the potential) and HCTH/147@6-311+G(3d,2p) function-

als yield the lowest errors and not the HCTH/147@cc-pVQZ functional. The latter basis set

has supposedly the lowest basis set error compared to the basis set limit [30]. The exchange

coeﬃcients (cXσ,n with m going from 0 to 4) of all the functionals at this level of basis set

quality seem to be similar for the diﬀerent functionals reported in Table II. In contrast, the

correlation parameters exhibit a wider variation upon switching between the ﬁtting sets with

7

93, 147 or 407 systems [8]. The eﬀect of the diﬀuse functions on the basis set going from the

HCTH/147@cc-pVTZ to the HCTH/147@aug-cc-pVTZ functional is not as signiﬁcant as

the change between the diﬀerent “basis set functionals” of triple-zeta quality. Nevertheless,

the coeﬃcients still diﬀer by a signiﬁcant amount, suggesting that convergence towards the

basis set limit has not been achieved. However, if similar basis set errors are absorbed into

the parameterisation of functionals ﬁtted to diﬀerent triple and quadruple-zeta basis sets,

the functionals are expected to be fairly transferable. In addition, the functional error is

only very slightly inﬂuenced by changing some of the functionals coeﬃcients. We have to

note that using functionals with quadruple-zeta quality or higher is not useful, since the

basis set error is probably about a magnitude lower than the functional error itself.

In Tables III to VI we investigate the transferability of the “basis set functionals” in

more detail. Here, all the new functionals developed are evaluated with the 6-31+G**,

aug-cc-pVDZ, 6-311+G(3d,2p) and TZ2P basis sets. The results for the 6-31+G** basis

for selected functionals that are listed in Table I are shown in Table III. As expected, the

HCTH/147@3-21G and HCTH/147@6-31G functionals are clearly insuﬃcient to describe the

properties investigated. Reasonably low errors are obtained with all functionals being ﬁt to

the 6-31G* basis set or larger. Interestingly, in the case of the 6-31+G** basis set, only the

HCTH/147@DZP and HCTH/147@aug-cc-pVDZ functionals show Q1 errors below 40 a.u.,

aﬀected mainly by the gradient error contribution. In comparison (Table I), the functional

optimised for this basis set has a Q1 value of 32.5 a.u.. For all the triple-zeta quality function-

als, the RMS energy error is lower, but the gradients (geometries) counterbalance this eﬀect.

All of these “basis set functionals”, with the exception of HCTH/147@6-311+G(3df,3pd)
and HCTH/147@aug-cc-pVTZ, give very similar Q1 errors, with RMS energy errors of 6.7 ±

0.3 kcal/mol and a gradient error around 3.6 a.u.. Overall, the triple-zeta and quadruple-zeta

quality functionals vary by at most 20% in both errors.

The evaluation of the functionals with the aug-cc-pVDZ basis set yields similar results

(Table IV). Of course, the overall error Q1 is higher, as is evident from the larger er-

ror obtained by the HCTH/147@aug-cc-pVDZ functional compared to the HCTH/147@6-

31+G** functional displayed in Table I. The gradient errors are especially aﬀected.

Only the double-zeta quality “basis set functionals” yield errors that can be com-

pared to the Q1 value of 42.4 a.u. obtained with the HCTH/147@aug-cc-pVDZ func-

tional (Table I). Here, the HCTH/147@6-311+G(3d,2p), HCTH/147@6-311+G(3df,2pd),

8

HCTH/147@TZ2P, HCTH/147@aug-cc-pVTZ and HCTH/147@cc-pVQZ functionals again

yield higher errors, mainly because of the gradient (and partly due to the energy) contribu-

tions to the error Q1. Thus, the functionals ﬁt to the double-zeta quality basis sets give the

lowest errors when applied to other basis sets of double-zeta quality.

If we evaluate the functionals with triple-zeta quality basis sets, we observe, as expected,

that their errors are a lot closer to the lowest error possible obtained by the basis sets to which

the functionals were ﬁt. When using the 6-311+G(3d,2p) basis set, the double-zeta “basis

set functionals” yield the lowest gradient errors, although again this is only achieved when

including diﬀuse diﬀuse functions. As for the other entire basis set evaluations in Tables III to

VI, the double-zeta basis sets give a much lower error for the gradients, but not for the energy.

This is an interesting phenomenon; the same observation was made in a diﬀerent context[52]

when GGA functionals were developed solely for the description of accurate structures and

frequencies[53]. Hence, it is probably a lot harder to develop a single functional for both

accurate geometries and energies rather than one for each individual property. However,

the former approach of separating the calculations can lead to other problems, namely that

energetic properties will be calculated at non-equilibrium structures. The HCTH/147@cc-

pVQZ, HCTH/147@cc-pVTZ and HCTH/147@aug-cc-pVTZ functionals again yield higher

errors than the other functionals developed with a triple-zeta quality basis set. Noteworthy is

the low error of the HCTH/147@TZ2P functional when applied to the 6-311+G(3d,2p) basis

set, resulting in a Q1 value of 15.5 compared to the minimum value of 15.0 a.u. obtained

by the HCTH/147@6-311+G(3d,2p) functional. This is even lower than the error of the

HCTH/147@6-311+G(3df,2pd) functional obtained with the 6-311+G(3d,2p) basis set. This

emphasises the transferability of the functionals that have been ﬁtted to the higher basis sets,

since the variance is less than 10% on Q1 and on the RMS energy error and the gradient

errors (with the exception of the HCTH/147@cc-pVTZ and HCTH/147@6-311+G(2d,p)

functionals for the RMS energy error). A number of the functionals parameterised for the

triple-zeta basis sets yield a lower error when evaluating Q1 with the 6-311+G(3d,2p) basis

set rather than for the basis set to which they were ﬁt (compare to Table I). This indicates

that a large amount of the remaining basis set errors absorbed into these functionals is of a

similar magnitude.

In Table VI, the performance of the diﬀerent “basis set functionals” with the TZ2P basis

set is shown. All errors are slightly larger (by about 10%), but the trends are again the same.

9

The HCTH/147@DZP basis set functional now gives a lower error than the HCTH/147@6-

31+G** functional, but only by a small margin. Again, the functionals ﬁtted to Dunning’s

basis sets of double-zeta quality yield larger errors than the other functionals ﬁtted to basis

sets of double-zeta quality. Among the triple-zeta level “basis set functionals”, the errors

vary by only 10%, supporting the observations made for the 6-311+G(3d,2p) basis set. When

evaluating the HCTH/147@3-21G and HCTH/147@6-31G functionals in Tables IV to VI,

the former functional has a lower gradient error. Hence, polarisation functions are essential

when calculating geometries, reducing the gradient errors by a factor of two and more.

In summary, the triple-zeta “basis set functionals” are transferable between each other,

indicating that when ﬁtting using basis sets of this quality, the basis set error absorbed in

the parameterisation does not play a role. The variance of 10% or less when evaluating one

functional ﬁt with a certain basis set with a diﬀerent one is probably not important. This

has further implications in the use of density functionals. Since the errors do not change

signiﬁcantly when going to higher basis sets, the triple-zeta basis set level is likely to be

suﬃcient for use in density functional calculations. With still larger basis sets, the basis set

truncation error will “drown in the noise” that is the inherent error of the functional itself.

In general, Dunning’s correlation-consistent basis sets developed for correlated ab initio

methods yield higher errors than the various Pople basis sets or TZ2P. When we investigated

this behaviour in more detail, we found that the inclusion of core-valence basis functions

[54, 55] only lowers the RMS energy error by 0.1 kcal/mol.

Inclusion of an additional

tight d-function[56], which has been shown to be important for second-row elements[57],

reduces this error by a further 0.3 kcal/mol. Furthermore, these contributions lower the

sum of the gradient error by another 0.1 a.u.

If we assume that the same contributions

were added to the HCTH/147@aug-cc-pVTZ functionals results, we would probably arrive

at a Q value close to the lowest value obtained. Thus, although several enhancements

for correlation-consistent basis sets could be introduced, extensive complements of higher-

angular momentum functions, in particular, do not appear to be necessary. Out of all basis

sets tested, the HCTH functional ﬁt to the 6-311+G(3df,2pd) basis set gives the lowest

energies and gradients errors, and the HCTH functional ﬁt to the TZ2P basis set yields the

lowest errors for the quantity Q, which includes energies, gradients and potential points. We

believe that this is due to correlation eﬀects described by the exchange-correlation potential

in the core that cannot be adequately described by the 6-311+G basis sets.

10

III. HYBRID FUNCTIONALS AND BASIS SETS

The method applied in the last section to the GGA functionals is now used for hybrid

functionals to assess the diﬀerent basis sets. There is, however, one complication: the

varying amount of exact Hartree-Fock exchange. Here, we ﬁtted hybrid functionals to the

6-31+G**, aug-cc-pVDZ, 6-311+G(3d,2p), TZ2P and aug-cc-pVTZ basis sets, using the

abovementioned procedure. While the inclusion of the exchange-correlation potential points

into the ﬁts for hybrid functionals is possible[10], it is not clear if the overall performance of

these functionals is generally better[58], as we will also see in the ﬁnal section. Therefore,

we restrict ourselves to ﬁtting to gradients and energies only (similar to the determination

of Q1 in the last section, see Eqn. 6). All functionals were again ﬁt to the 147 systems, but

with m=2 in the power series in Eqn. 2. This cut-oﬀ in the power series expansion yields

the B97-1 form rather than the HCTH form. Here, 9 linear coeﬃcients are ﬁt instead of the

15 in the GGA. The amount of exact exchange was varied over a range from 0% to 50% in

order to determine the minimum.

Before discussing the outcome of the results of the hybrid functionals, it is worth com-

paring the values at 0% Hartree-Fock exchange to the functionals obtained in the previous

section. The diﬀerence between them is the ﬁt to exchange-correlation potentials, which will

raise the Q1 error for the GGA functionals in contrast to the “hybrid” functional at 0%. Of

course, another discrepancy is the diﬀerent number of coeﬃcients. The newly obtained GGA

functionals are displayed in Table VII, and can be compared (with the diﬀerences mentioned)

to those in Table I. For the TZ2P, 6-31+G** and aug-cc-pVDZ basis sets, the higher-order

coeﬃcients seem to change very little (see table I). While the energy error increases going

from m=2 to m=4, the gradient error decreases, with Q1 close to the errors when ﬁtting only

to gradients and energies with m=2. This has been previously reported[13, 50] and has led

to the conclusion that it is unnecessary to include orders higher than 2 in the power series.

Here, mainly the error in the potential is aﬀected as an additional calculation with the TZ2P

basis set and the variable Q shows. In this case, Q for the HCTH/147 with m=4 form yields

37 a.u., compared to 51 a.u. for the B97-1/147 form with m=2, hence the overall Q value

is raised by 40%. Comparing Tables I and VII, we realise that not only is the functional

somwehat dependent on the basis set for which it was parameterised, but also the basis set

dependence itself is dependent on the class of functional used.

11

Let us now return to the hybrid functionals. Since the error of the resulting functional

also correlates slightly with the starting guess used, the points will not necessarily ﬁt a

curve. Unlike the GGA functionals where we can determine the starting guess by ﬁtting

to exchange-correlation points, with hybrid functionals the initial coeﬃcients are, at best,

educated guesses. Thus, we sometimes had to ﬁt a curve through the points, and in Figure

1, the RMS energy error is plotted as a function of amount of exact exchange for various

functionals. This plot shows a disturbing property of hybrid functionals: the amount of exact

exchange in the functional depends on the basis set for which it is ﬁt. All hybrid density

functionals known have their exchange coeﬃcient ﬁt to a speciﬁc basis set (or are using

numerical DFT), hence the variation of the exact exchange, in the range of 15% to 25% might

well be due to basis set eﬀects. In the case of the tested functionals, the optimised exact

exchange-fractions for all three triple-zeta basis sets (obtaining B97-1/147@6-311+G(3d,2p),

B97-1/147@TZ2P and B97-1/147@aug-cc-pVTZ) hover around 18%. However, ﬁtting to a

double-zeta basis set (B97-1/147@6-31+G** and B97-1/147@aug-cc-pVDZ) yields minima

located around 28%.

In Figure 2, the value of Q1 is displayed, exhibiting generally the

same behaviour as the energy in Figure 1. Since this is the value used in the ﬁt (with more

sophisticated weights), it is more informative, albeit more abstract. Here, the diﬀerences

between the basis sets, which were already exhibited with the GGA functionals, can be seen

again. While the B97-1/147@6-31+G** and the B97-1/147@aug-cc-pVDZ functionals show

similar minima in the energies, with the B97-1/147@6-31+G** curve shifted a bit towards

lower values. Still, the gradient error when ﬁtting to the 6-31+G** basis is much lower than

with the aug-cc-pVDZ basis set. Similar behaviour is observed for the basis sets of triple-

zeta quality. Only when the gradients are included does the B97-1/147@TZ2P functional

yield a lower error for its minimum than B97-1/147@aug-cc-pVTZ, with the values obtained

by the B97-1/147@6-311+G(3d,2p) functional marginally lower still. Detailed results of the

minima are given in Table VII displaying the lowest energy points calculated. The minima

obtained when ﬁtting a separate curve through the points are at 29 and 28% for the B97-

1/147@6-311+G** and B97-1/147@aug-cc-pVDZ “basis set functionals”, and the minima

for the B97-1/147@6-311+G(3d,2p), B97-1/147@TZ2P and B97-1/147@aug-cc-pVTZ “basis

set functionals” are at 16, 17 and 17%, respectively.

IV. ASSESSMENT OF DENSITY FUNCTIONALS

In this section we assess several density functionals with two basis sets: cc-pVTZ and

TZ2P. The former basis set has been used in the construction of VSXC[3], and the latter in

the parameterisation of the HCTH-type functionals[6, 7, 8, 10, 11]. For this evaluation, we

use the large 407 Set[35], again comparing RMS energy, gradient and Q1 errors. A similar

comparison for most of the functionals evaluated has been done before, using the TZ2P basis

set and the much smaller sets of 93 and 147 molecules. Thus, we can assess if the results

will remain transferable between the G2-1 and G3 sets[50]. Table VIII shows all results

obtained.

• The simplest density functional method, LSDA in its VWN parameterisation, is al-

ready a vast improvement over the Hartree-Fock method. The LSDA geometries are

surprisingly accurate, even more so when comparing the gradient error to a vast num-

ber of GGA and meta-GGA functionals.

• For molecular systems, PKZB yields no clear improvement over PBE, although it was

developed as an improvement over PBE including a semi-empirical ﬁt and an extra

variable, the kinetic energy density τ . Both functionals give RMS energy errors close

to 20 kcal/mol.

In addition, we would expect geometry errors similar to the ones

obtained by the LSDA method. We would discourage the use of these functionals for

the calculation of both thermochemical data and geometries.

• mPW1K is a hybrid functional with a large percentage of exact exchange, developed

for accurate reproduction of reaction barriers, reducing the error of B3LYP for this

property by about 50%[65]. However, its performance for minimum geometries and

energetics of stable molecules is the worst of all hybrid functionals tested and even

standard GGA’s yield lower errors.

• PW91PW91, the original GGA proposed by Perdew, yields slightly lower errors than

PBE, that largely come from the evaluation of the gradients.

• When replacing the PW91 exchange functional with mPW91, the RMS energy error

is reduced, yet the gradient error increases.

13

• The BP86 GGA functional, albeit an improvement over these methods, still gives a Q1

error almost three times larger than the best functionals available. The RMS energy

error is lowered by 5 kcal/mol when using the cc-pVTZ basis set instead of TZ2P; the

gradient error however increases.

• BLYP is one of the more accurate functionals, but generally overestimates bond dis-

tances, and its gradient error is extremely large. This leads to RMS errors in bond

lengths that are almost twice as high as for hybrid functionals[8]. Nevertheless, it

is still one of the commonly used functionals, very often employed when calculat-

ing hydrogen bonds[59] or in Car-Parrinello Molecular Dynamics simulations of liquid

water[60]. Its RMS and gradient errors both increase when using the cc-pVTZ basis

set.

In contrast to the smaller sets, the BLYP functional now clearly outperforms

BP86 for the 407 set, whereas this was not the case for the 93 set[50].

• The BPW91 functional uses Becke’s exchange functional in combination with PW91

correlation, and yields lower errors than the PW91 and mPW91 exchange functionals

for the properties tested. Here, the functional gives a performance similar to BLYP,

perhaps slightly better. Again, its gradient error is higher for the cc-pVTZ basis set.

• PBE0 does not yield better energy predictions

than the GGA functionals

mPW91PW91, BPW91 and BLYP. Interestingly, its gradient error is lower than the

one obtained for the most commonly used functional B3LYP, thus we would expect a

pretty accurate description of geometries and higher-order properties.

• OLYP[61] is a clear improvement over BLYP for atomisation energies and reactions,

and even more so for molecular structures[62, 63]. Its overall errors are almost compa-

rable to those of the hybrid functionals, much better than BLYP and BPW91. Here,

an improved exchange functional OPTX is used instead of Becke’s exchange functional.

However, its performance in hydrogen bonds is not as good as BLYP.[64]

• B98 does exactly the opposite of PBE0: We would expect its geometries to be further

away from the equilibrium than B3LYP, but its energy error is slightly decreased. In

the overall Q1 evaluation, the error is very similar to the one obtained by the older

B3LYP.

14

• The B3LYP functional is probably the most widely used hybrid functional, and every

new functional is compared to its accuracy. The RMS error for the 407 Set is close

to 10 kcal/mol, which is considerably large compared to a “chemical accuracy” of 2

kcal/mol. The gradient error is again slightly increased for the cc-pVTZ basis set

compared to TZ2P.

• B97-2 is a reparameterisation of B97-1 including the ZMP potential points into the

ﬁt of the exchange-correlation functional. Hence, we can expect its energy error to be

worse than B97-1, since the ﬁt to an extra quantity usually worsens the performance

to the energies. However, its advantages over B97-1 still have to be established since

even its gradient error is larger.

• The performance of VSXC for the 407 set is very similar to B3LYP. This contrasts

with the bad performance of VSXC for the smaller 93 Set where it returned an error

barely lower than the BLYP functional[50]. Fitted to the cc-pVTZ basis set, it is the

only functional yielding similar errors for both basis sets.

• All HCTH functionals give errors which diﬀer in Q1 by less than 3% for the TZ2P

basis set and less than 8% for the cc-pVTZ basis set. These functionals, while they are

pure GGA functionals, yield errors that can be compared to hybrid functionals like

B3LYP for both the TZ2P and cc-pVTZ basis sets. Here, the additional value added

to the functional by reparameterising it to 147 or 407 systems is not obvious, although

the HCTH/407 functional outperforms the other parameterisations in the RMS energy

error. The Q1 value of HCTH/407 is the worst for the HCTH functionals with the

cc-pVTZ basis set. The justiﬁcation for the reparameterisation, making HCTH/407

a better functional than HCTH/93 or HCTH/147, will become only visible when

considering hydrogen bonds or inorganic molecules[52, 59] where error cancellation

plays an important role. Generally, this error cancellation cannot be expected in DFT

methods. In some post-Hartree-Fock methods like MP2 it is inherent, and hence the

reparameterisation of the functionals remains important to recapture such eﬀects.

• B97-1 is probably the best choice when it comes to using density functional hybrid

calculations, since it is already well tested and its calculated structures are similar

to those obtained by B3LYP (or even slightly better), and it outperforms B3LYP by

15

about a third in Q1 when predicting energetic properties.

• τ -HCTH is for both basis sets an improvement over the HCTH functional showing that

the inclusion of the kinetic energy density can lower the error further. Unfortunately,

it lacks the performance of the HCTH/407 functional for weak interactions[11, 36].

• The τ -HCTH hybrid, when additionally including exact exchange, clearly yields the

lowest Q1 value of all methods tested. Its error for the TZ2P basis set is 50% lower

than the one obtained by B3LYP in addition to yielding a lower gradient error and

structures[11] than B3LYP.

Summarising the results in table VIII, by ranking all GGA functionals based on their Q1

value, we get the following order (taking into account that some functionals have been ﬁt to

one of the basis sets):

< BP86 < PW91PW91 < PBE

HCTH/147 ≈ HCTH/93 ≈ HCTH/407 < OLYP < BPW91 < BLYP < mPW91PW91

For the meta-GGA’s and hybrid functionals, the ordering is:
τ -HCTH hybrid < B97-1 < τ -HCTH < VSXC ≈ B97-2 ≈ B3LYP ≈ B98 < PBE0 ≪

mPW1K < PKZB

Although RMS errors can give a lot of insight, the maximum errors are also considered

important.

In light of this, we have examined in Table IX the number of molecules in

the 407 set for each functional that have large RMS energy errors (over 15 kcal/mol). As

we have discussed in the basis set evaluation, the cc-pVTZ basis set generally exhibits

more outliers (molecules with atypically large errors) than the TZ2P basis set. The results

are very similar to the ones obtained in Table VIII, and compared to B3LYP, the best

available functional (the τ -HCTH hybrid) cuts the number of outliers in half, yielding a

considerable improvement. With regard to the accuracy of density functional theory with

all the evaluations which are done with the 407 Set, the RMS error of the functionals

ranges between 6 (τ -HCTH hybrid) and 21 kcal/mol (PBE), with the most commonly used

hybrid functional B3LYP yielding an error around 10 kcal/mol. The mean error of these

functionals is between 3.8 kcal and 15.6 kcal mol, with B3LYP yielding 6.2 kcal/mol. This

can be compared to empirical correction methods like G3[34], which yield errors around 1

kcal/mol for the G3 set that, however, does not include some of the molecules with the

largest errors in our 407 set. Extrapolation methods like W2 [66] give mean errors around

16

0.5 kcal/mol for a considerably smaller set similar to our 147 Set. Full MP2 yielded an RMS

error of about 20 kcal/mol for the 407 Set using the TZ2P basis set. This generally places

the accuracy of DFT between raw perturbation theory results and coupled-cluster theory

when calculating ground state energies.

V. CONCLUSIONS

From the above, we can make a number of observations concerning the use of DFT

functionals and the basis sets used with them. All results regarding the basis sets are

obtained by ﬁtting functionals to basis sets, and then evaluating their errors, thus the results

are independent of the functional parameterisation. For most of the properties investigated,

including energies and gradients, the Pople basis sets can be recommended. Dunning’s

basis sets, ﬁt to CISD, give considerably higher errors despite having a larger number of

basis functions. Although it yields a higher error than the 6-311+G(3df,2pd) basis set for

energies and gradients, the TZ2P basis set still gives the lowest overall error for the GGA

functionals when including the ZMP exchange-correlation potentials into the ﬁt. The basis

set error, which might still be signiﬁcant at the triple-zeta level, shows that the functionals

obtained by ﬁtting to one basis set are transferable to other basis sets. Hence, it is probably

not important to reach the basis set limit when developing new density functionals, since

the overall DFT error is considerably larger. Basis sets developed for DFT methods might

alleviate this problem, but the problem remains as to which functional to use for their

development. The same analysis for hybrid density functionals shows that the amount

of exact exchange obtained is dependent on the basis set itself. Whereas basis sets of

double-zeta quality yielded minima around 28%, the triple-zeta basis sets evaluated had their

minima around 18%. Concerning the diﬀerence between the hybrid “basis set functionals”,

the same conclusions as for the GGA functionals can be drawn. The same trends are also

visible when evaluating several other published functionals to a large test set. We can

deduce that several hybrid functionals, such as B97-1 and the τ -HCTH hybrid functional

render errors which are signiﬁcantly lower than the ones obtained by B3LYP. As a pure GGA

functional, the HCTH functional types give errors comparable to B3LYP for the investigated

properties.

Nevertheless, the accuracy of modern density functional theory cannot be compared to

17

that of ab initio extrapolation methods. The best functional tested yields an RMS energy

error as large as 6.3 kcal/mol for a large set of molecules, which is still far away from the

desired “chemical accuracy” of 1-2 kcal/mol.

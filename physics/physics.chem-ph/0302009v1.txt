We present a new method to extract distance and orientation dependent potentials between amino
acid side chains using a database of protein structures and the standard Boltzmann device. The
importance of orientation dependent interactions is ﬁrst established by computing orientational or-
der parameters for proteins with α-helical and β-sheet architecture. Extraction of the anisotropic
interactions requires deﬁning local reference frames for each amino acid that uniquely determine
the coordinates of the neighboring residues. Using the local reference frames and histograms of the
radial and angular correlation functions for a standard set of non-homologue protein structures, we
construct the anisotropic pair potentials. The performance of the orientation dependent potentials
was studied using a large database of decoy proteins. The results demonstrate that the new dis-
tance and orientation dependent residue-residue potentials present a signiﬁcantly improved ability
to recognize native folds from a set of native and decoy protein structures.

INTRODUCTION

A major goal of proteomics is to determine structures
of proteins rapidly. It is impractical to obtain very high
resolution structures on a genome wide scale. Further-
more, for processing biological functions it is important
to characterize the dynamics and thermodynamics of a
network of proteins. From a computational perspective,
it is currently impossible to realize these goals using all-
atom molecular dynamics simulations1,2. Thus, there
is an urgent need to develop coarse-grained, yet reli-
able, models for protein structures. Construction of such
models requires the determination of interaction poten-
tials between amino acid residues. The wealth of struc-
tural data on a number of proteins in the Protein Data
Bank (PDB)3 has been a source for obtaining interaction
potentials4,5,6.

The idea of using the frequencies of amino acid pairing
to determine potential interaction parameters was ﬁrst
proposed by Tanaka and Scheraga7. With the exception
of a few studies8, most of the “knowledge-based” poten-
tials have been obtained solely in terms of residue-residue
contacts. Sippl8 and others have introduced an explicit
distance dependence in the database-derived mean force
potentials using the Boltzmann formula. This method,
known as the “Boltzmann device”, assumes that the
known protein structures from the PDB correspond to
classical equilibrium states. The side chain - side chain
(SC-SC) potentials can be related to distance-dependent
probability densities f (r) by the relation

U ij(r) = −kT ln

(1)

f ij(r)
fref (r)

(cid:20)

(cid:21)

where f ij(r) is the probability density for a side chain of

type i to be separated by a distance r from a side chain
of type j, and the choice of the reference probability den-
sity fref (r) is very important9,10. Sippl10 suggests that
r can be the distance between two atoms or some other
structural parameter such as dihedral angles. Other sta-
tistical potentials developed subsequently using this ap-
proach have interpreted f (r) as the distance-dependent
probability density.

In recent years, a number of studies have evaluated
the goodness of statistical potentials based on pairwise
additive interactions between residues9,11,12,13,14,15,16,17.
These studies have concluded that pairwise additive po-
tentials, dependent only on the radial distance between
residues, are inadequate for structure prediction. One of
the major drawbacks of using contact potentials or po-
tentials that only depend on the radial distance is that
the relative orientation between the amino acids, which
plays a role in the packing of the protein interior, is not
taken into account. To account for the dense interior of
the folded states of proteins it is crucial to optimize the
relative orientation of the participating side chains18. It
is the purpose of this paper to examine the relevance of
interaction potentials between amino acids that include
the orientational dependence.

By analyzing the angular distribution of side chains
around amino acids, Bahar and Jernigan19 showed that
some residue pairs have speciﬁc coordination states with
much higher probabilities than those expected from ran-
dom distributions. Another indication that the relative
residue-residue orientations are important is the recent
success of the united-residue force ﬁeld (UNRES) devel-
oped by Scheraga and coworkers20,21,22. The SC-SC in-
teractions of the UNRES potentials are parameterized
as van der Waals potentials with a pair-speciﬁc angular
dependence included in the well depth. The UNRES po-

tentials employ a generalized Gay-Berne potential23,24,25
that assumes that the interacting sites are ellipsoids of
revolution placed at the center of mass of the side chains.
Although the relative side chain orientations are de-
scribed in a simpliﬁed manner, the success of the UN-
RES potentials demonstrates the importance of includ-
ing orientational dependence in the side chain interaction
potential.

This idea is also supported by recent studies of protein
side chain packing26 which found that current potentials
can accommodate more than one rotamer for 95% of side
chain positions. These studies suggest that interaction
potentials that can discriminate between a large number
of competing rotamer states are required.

The main goals of this paper are (a) to extract statis-
tical information about the relative residue-residue ori-
entations and distances in proteins using the available
high resolution PDB structures and (b) to investigate
the utility of the orientational information in enhancing
the ability of distance dependent potentials to identify
native protein folds. These goals can contribute to a
better understanding of the speciﬁc residue packing of
native protein structures. Motivated by the above men-
tioned results of Jernigan et al.19 and Scheraga et al.20,
we approached the ﬁrst goal by deﬁning local reference
frames (LRFs) that permit a more precise, quantitative
description of the relative orientation of a given pair of
side chains. The new LRFs are related more closely to
the three-dimensional conﬁguration of the individual side
chains, rather than to their relative position with respect
to the backbone or to the neighboring residues. We could
extract thus novel radial and angular dependent inter-
residue statistical potentials that reﬂect the speciﬁc dis-
tributions of distances and relative SC-SC orientations as
observed in native structures of real proteins. In order to
address our second goal we tested the eﬃcacy of the new
potentials by using a large database of incorrect models
of real proteins27,28, known as decoys. These decoys are
computer-generated models of protein structures, speciﬁ-
cally designed for being used in evaluating the capacity of
various potential functions to distinguish the native-like
conformations from non-native ones.

Before presenting our methods and the results that
we obtained, a few clariﬁcations are necessary. First, a
complete set of potentials for coarse-grained protein fold-
ing simulations should take into account interactions be-
tween side chains, interactions between side chains and
peptide groups29, and energetics dependent on torsional
angles that deﬁne the backbone structure20,21,22. We
only investigate the speciﬁc features of SC-SC interac-
tions, as has been done before in studies of statistical
potentials that are only contact or distance dependent.
Secondly, we constructed our own corresponding set of
distance-dependent potentials rather than employing po-

tentials constructed by other authors.
we minimized the possibility that a better parameter
ﬁtting, speciﬁc computational implementation, or other
technical aspects could aﬀect our results. Finally, as in

dard, reproducible approach, by employing the set of
non-homologous proteins that was used by Scheraga et
al.20,21,22 for similar purposes.

II. METHODS

The relative residue-residue orientations are thought to
be directly related to the nature of the forces that shape
the speciﬁc three-dimensional structures of proteins19,20.
However, a quantitative approach to the statistical ex-
traction of these orientational information from high res-
olution structures is still needed. The necessity of in-
cluding orientation dependent interactions is established
in section II A by computing correlation functions that
probe orientational order in the PDB structures.
It is
shown that, for a given native state topology, the orien-
tational packing of side chains may be decomposed into
a linear combination of simple cluster geometries. How-
ever, the use of simple orientational order parameters is
not suﬃcient for discriminating between basic protein
architectures such as α-helix or β-sheet. As such, we are
motivated to use more detailed quantitative descriptions
of relative residue orientations. In order to achieve this
goal, in section II B we introduce deﬁnitions of amino acid
dependent local reference frames (LRFs) that permit a
standard description of the relative SC-SC orientations.
A method for extracting the radial and angular depen-
dent pair distribution functions is presented in section
II C, emphasizing the limits imposed on the statistical
analysis by the accuracy of the available experimental
database of protein structures.

A. Measures of Orientational Order. The
Dependence of Anisotropy on Native State Topology

The speciﬁcity of SC-SC contacts suggests that the rel-
ative residue orientations should play a signiﬁcant role in
determining packing in proteins. This idea, supported
by the study of Bahar and Jernigan19, builds up on the
more general theme of how side chains pack in the native
states of proteins18,26. The observation that the interior
of protein structures is densely packed31,32,33 raises the
question if one can use a simple crystal lattice descrip-
tion (e.g. sc, bcc, etc.) for the side chain packing. While
there are many qualitative descriptions of residue pack-
ing, they are mainly based on the notion that hydropho-
bic interactions are responsible for globular shapes30 and
that speciﬁc polar interactions and hydrogen bonding
are important stabilizing factors. Because these stud-
ies do not address quantitatively the issue of relative side
chain orientations, we used orientational order parame-
ters (OOPs)34 to asses their importance.

The Orientational Order Parameters (OOPs) were

introduced34 to analyze the internal structure of liquids
and glasses and have been used as reaction coordinates
for studying the structure of a nucleating system35,36,37.
The OOPs are deﬁned in terms of “bonds” that connect
a central particle to its neighbors. For each “bond”, one
can compute the corresponding values of the spherical
harmonic functions Ylm(θ, φ) that can be used as local
order parameters

Qlm(r) ≡ Ylm(θ(r), φ(r)) .

(2)

where r is the position vector of the central particle and
θ(r) and φ(r) are the polar and azimuthal angles of vector
r with respect to any reference frame (see, e.g.35). To
make the Qlm values representative for describing the
orientational order of an entire system of particles, the
global orientational parameters are deﬁned as

¯Qlm ≡

Qlm(ri)

where Nb is the total number of bonds in the system.

Both Qlm and ¯Qlm depend on the choice of local ref-
erence frame in which the Ylm values are calculated.

bonds of a particle. The orientational order parameters
Ql and Wl, together with the reduced order parameter
ˆWl have speciﬁc values for a number of simple cluster
geometries such as face-centered-cubic (fcc), hexagonal
close-packed (hcp), body-centered-cubic (bcc), simple cu-
bic (sc) and icosahedral (icos). If only the spherical term
(l = 0) dominates, then it is clear that orientational po-
tentials are not expected to be important. The emergence
of non-zero values of Ql and Wl not only signify that side
chain orientations are important in dense packing but
may also point to the nature of orientational ordering.

All the low-order values (l ≤ 10) of the parameters
Ql, Wl and ˆWl are sensitive to the structural details that

are speciﬁc to the simple cluster geometries mentioned
above34,35. However, for practical reasons, monitoring
the values of Q4, Q6, ˆW4 and ˆW6 suﬃces to discriminate
between the diﬀerent cluster geometries36,37. The values
of these four OOPs (Fig. 1a) serve as a reference to
which the values computed using PDB structures can be
compared. Due to scale diﬀerences between Ql and ˆWl,
the values of ˆW4 and ˆW6 were multiplied by 10.

We calculated the Q4, Q6, ˆW4 and ˆW6 parameters
(shown in Fig. 1b) for three sets of 50 proteins from
the same family with α-helical and β-strand architectures

lected homologue structures to maximize the possibility

of ﬁnding OOPs that have diﬀerent, characteristic values
for diﬀerent protein architectures.
If similar OOP val-
ues were obtained for the homologue sets of hemoglobins
(Hb) and myoglobins (Mb), yet diﬀerent from the ones
measured for immunoglobulins (Ig), it would be a strong
indication that the OOPs are a sensitive measure of pro-
tein architecture. As shown next, this is not the case
and, therefore, the more detailed investigation of the rel-
ative orientations of side chains is necessary. The three
rows in Fig. 1b correspond to averages calculated: (a)
for all the types of side chains (top), (b) only for ﬁve
highly hydrophobic side chains (middle), and (c) for ﬁve
hydrophilic residues (bottom). The hydrophobic side
chains considered were Ile, Leu, Val, Phe and Met, while
the polar residues were Asn, Gln, Ser, Thr and His. In
Fig. 1b, the columns correspond to the three sets of pro-
teins that were analyzed. The ﬁrst set had ﬁfty diﬀer-
ent immunoglobulin structures with β-sheet architecture
(left), the second set consisted of ﬁfty hemoglobins with
α-helical structures (middle) and, ﬁnally, the third set
comprised ﬁfty diﬀerent myoglobin structures which also
have α-helical architecture (right).

While the computation of Ql and ˆWl

in liquids is
straight forward, for their correct calculation in proteins
one needs to consider the following points: (1) The size
of the protein must be large enough to obtain meaningful
average values. Because helices or β-sheets do not have
“interior” points, the notion of packing itself is meaning-
ful only for tertiary structures. Hence, the proteins must
contain enough tertiary “structure”18; (2) A meaningful
cut-oﬀ distance must be selected in the identiﬁcation of
near neighbors for a given side chain. The three protein
data sets used in this study are suﬃciently large that
Ql and ˆWl can be easily computed to assess the degree
of anisotropy in the relative residue-residue orientations.
We used a neighbor “cut-oﬀ” distance that is 1.2 times
the value of the position of the ﬁrst peak in the radial
distribution function for each structure. This deﬁnition
ensured that all the side chains in the ﬁrst coordination
shell were counted as neighbors34.
In the calculations
presented here the centers of the residues were taken to
be the geometric centers of the heavy atoms in the side
chains.

Comparison of the results in Fig. 1a and Fig. 1b shows
that a simple “standard” crystallographic type of order
is absent in proteins. This shows that the interior of pro-
teins does not have a simple point group symmetry. We
calculated the values of the correlation coeﬃcients be-
tween the OOPs presented in Fig. 1b and the ones in
Fig. 1a. These calculations show that a simple “stan-
dard” crystallographic type of order is absent in pro-
teins. The interior of proteins does not have a simple
point group symmetry, which would have permitted the
development of a simple, quantitative description of side
chains packing. In Fig. 2 are shown the correlation co-
eﬃcients between the theoretical OOPs values (Fig. 1a)
and the OOPs (Fig. 1b) calculated for the three sets of
proteins with α-helical and β-strand structures (Table I)
. The absolute magnitudes of the correlation coeﬃcients
are not very meaningful when comparing small data sets,
but their relative values can give us a quantitative indica-
tion if the order parameter values are closer to one type
of cluster geometry (e.g. fcc) than to another (e.g. icos).
The results are shown in Fig. 2a by averaging:(a) over
all the residue types (top, all ), (b) over the ﬁve most
hydrophobic residues (middle, H ) and (c) over the ﬁve
most strongly polar side chain types (bottom, P ). Please
note that the all data represents averages computed over
all 20 amino acids, while the H and P sets correspond to
only 5 amino acids each. Therefore, the results for the all
set are not necessarily averages of the corresponding H
and P values. The three curves in each ﬁgure correspond
to correlation coeﬃcients calculated for the immunoglob-
ulins with β-sheet architecture (circles), for the set of
hemoglobins with α-helical structures (squares), and for
the α-helical myoglobins (triangles). A diﬀerent plot of
the same correlation coeﬃcients is also shown in Fig. 2b
for the values calculated for: (a) the set of immunoglobu-
lins (top, β), (b) the set of hemoglobins (middle, α1), and
(c) the set of myoglobins (bottom, α2). The three curves

gles).

The analysis of the results in Fig. 2 leads to the fol-
lowing conclusions: (1) There is no clear trend towards
a single geometry associated to side chain packing. Nev-
ertheless, we observe signiﬁcant values for Q4 and Q6
that suggests that high order orientational correlations
characteristic of fcc, bcc, or icosahedral (icos) clusters
(or a combination of these) are observed in proteins with
α-helical and β-sheet architecture. (2) While there are
strong correlations indicating an icosahedral packing of
residues (most evident for polar residues in Fig. 2a, bot-
tom), we also ﬁnd signiﬁcant contributions from the other
types of cluster geometries. For example, for both β-
strand (Fig. 2b top) and α-helical (Fig. 2b middle) archi-
tectures, both the hcp and sc geometries make signiﬁcant
contributions. This is in accord with the observations of
Bagci et al.38 who showed that there is a general uniform
distribution of residues in proteins, two-thirds being ap-
proximately fcc packed and one-third occupying random
positions. We also observed high correlations between
the fcc packing and the orientational order of both hy-
drophobic and strongly polar residues in some α-helical
molecular structures like in myoglobins (Fig. 2a middle
and bottom and Fig. 2b bottom), but there is also a
high correlation for the icosahedral character of packing
in those cases. (3) There is a strong similarity in the dis-
tribution of OOPs between the β-sheet immunoglobulin
structures and the α-helical hemoglobins (Fig. 2b). How-
ever, there is considerable diﬀerence in the orientational
order between the two α-helical proteins (hemoglobins
and myoglobins). This suggests that even within a given
fold there can be variations in the precise orientational
registry of the side chains. Similarly, it appears that
proteins with vastly diﬀerent architecture can have sim-
ilar orientational order. A more detailed investigation
of orientational order in a large data set of proteins is
warranted.

The results presented here show that the bond-
orientational order parameters are useful quantitative
tools in investigating the orientational order of side
chains in proteins. They also demonstrate that, for a
given native state topology, the orientational packing of
side chains may be decomposed into a linear combination
of simple cluster geometries. The importance of orienta-
tional degrees of freedom in the packing of side chains re-
inforces the need for deciphering anisotropic inter-residue
potentials from PDB structures. A method to extract
such potentials is described next.

the positions of the Cα and Cβ atoms and the local Ox axis
is deﬁned by the positions of the Cβ and Cγ atoms.

protein side chains in order to build a quantitative de-
scription of their relative orientations. The deﬁnition of
LRFs for SC-SC interactions is illustrated in Fig. 3. The
local Oz axis is deﬁned by the positions of the Cα and
Cβ atoms. The local Ox axis is deﬁned by the positions
of the Cβ and Cγ atoms. The right handed nature of the
LRFs determines automatically the direction of the Oy
axis if Ox and Oz are known. Once the local axes are
deﬁned, the polar angles θ and φ and the inter-residue
distances r can be used as internal degrees of freedom
that describe the relative residue-residue orientations as
shown in Fig. 3. These deﬁnitions are altered for the
following special cases: (1) Gly does not have Cβ and
the local Oz axis is deﬁned by the bisector of the angle
deﬁned by N i, Ci
α and Ci, (2) both Gly and Ala do not
have Cγ and the local Ox axis is deﬁned as parallel to
the direction deﬁned by the backbone atoms N i and Ci,
(3) for Cys and Ser the corresponding coordinates of the
S and O atoms are substituted for the coordinates of the
missing Cγ, and (4) the coordinates of the midpoint be-
tween the two Cγ atoms are used to deﬁne the direction
of the Ox axis for Ile and Val. For each amino acid the
interaction center (Si) is deﬁned as the center of mass
of the heavy atoms in the side chain with the exception
of Gly for which the position of Si coincides with Cα.

Ile-Arg, Arg-Ile and Arg-Arg interactions. The probability
amplitudes correspond to the scale shown in the scale bar, in

units of 10
the highly hydrophilic (Arg) residue are chosen to investigate
if hydropathic properties are reﬂected in maps. Sample local
reference frames (LRFs) for Ile and Arg are also depicted.
The origins of the LRFs are placed in the centers of mass of
the heavy atoms in the respective side-chains.

Sample LRFs for Ile and Val are also shown in Fig. 4.

C. Finding the structure-derived potentials

From the deﬁnition of the LRFs, it follows that the
SC-SC interaction potentials depend on ﬁve independent
parameters that deﬁne the relative positions of two dis-
tant side-chains i and j: rij , φij , θij, φji and θji. We
assume that these are the only geometrical factors that
inﬂuence the two-body interactions between two residues
i and j (|j − i| ≥ 4). One more independent parameter
(a torsional angle around rij ) can be used for a complete
description of the relative orientations of the two residues
in three dimensions, but it is not employed in this work
because its inﬂuence is expected to be important only
for short range interactions. Accounting for this sixth
angular parameter would also increase dramatically the
statistical requirements for the protein database that is
analyzed. Assuming pairwise interactions, the distance
and orientation dependent potential for the residue pair

ij is

U ij = U ij

DO(rij , φij , θij, φji, θji)

(7)

We further assume that U ij

DO can be decomposed as

U ij
DO(rij , φij , θij, φji, θji) = U ij

DO(rij , φij , θij)

+U ji

DO(rji, φji, θji) (8)
We use the UDO notation for the statistical poten-
tials that are both distance and orientation dependent,
and the UD notation for potentials that depend solely on
inter-residue distances. The assumption in Eq. 8 on the
separability of potentials is not always valid. For a sys-
tem of interacting side chain pairs, described by a Boltz-
mann equilibrium, Eq. 8 is consistent, however, with the
probabilistic relation

P ij
total(rij , φij , θij, φji, θji) = P ij(rij , φij , θij)

×P ji(rji, φji, θji) (9)

where P ij
total(rij , φij, θij , φji, θji) is the probability to ﬁnd
a pair of interacting side chains i and j separated by a
distance rij = rji between their interaction centers, and
with relative orientations given by the set of (φij , θij) an-
gles in the LRFi frame, and by the set of (φji, θji) angles
in the LRFj frame (see Fig. 3). Eq. 8 implies, there-
fore, that the relative orientations of the local reference
frames LRFi and LRFj of two interacting side chains i
and j do not depend on each other. As suggested by
previous studies10,19,30, this type of independence could
be expected for side chains that are separated by a large
enough number of peptide bonds along the backbone.
This assumption is reasonable in our analysis because
only side chains that are separated by at least ﬁve peptide
bonds along the protein backbone are considered. This
corresponds to residues that are found on a “topological
level” k ≥ 58. Besides this constraint, for simplicity, we
are also considering (as in30) that the SC-SC interactions
are independent on sequence separation (i.e. for k ≥ 5,
all side chains are on the same topological level).

1. The Boltzmann Device

The Boltzmann device assumes that the known pro-
tein structures from protein databases (such as PDB)
correspond to classical equilibrium states. The SC-SC
potentials can therefore be related to position probabil-
ity densities f (r) (see Eq. 1), where r can be the radial
distance or the angle between the side-chains10. In many
studies, f (r) can be replaced by the normalized pair dis-
tribution functions g(r) such that

U ij

D (r) = −kT ln

gij(r)
gref (r)

(cid:20)

(cid:21)

(10)

for the distributions depending only on distances. We
adopt a more general treatment that deﬁnes
P ij(r, φ, θ)
Pref (r, φ, θ)

DO(r, φ, θ) = −kT ln

U ij

(11)

(cid:20)

(cid:21)

7

for the distance and orientation-dependent distributions.
To be consistent with previous studies, we consider the
reference pair distribution functions Pref to be the cor-
responding radial or angular pair distributions that are
obtained through an analysis of all twenty residue types.
A database of non homologous proteins can be used to
estimate the pair distributions and to extract amino acid
speciﬁc interaction potentials that are consistent with a
large set of protein structures.

An important issue that appears when using probabil-
ity density functions with the Boltzmann device for con-
structing statistical potentials is “the problem of small
data sets”. As noted by Sippl8, dividing the SC-SC pair
frequencies by both side chain type and distance inter-
vals results in situations when the available data is too
small for conventional statistical procedures. This prob-
lem was solved by Sippl by proposing a “sparse data
correction” formula that builds the correct probability
densities as linear combinations between the measured
data and the reference, total probability densities ob-
tained by averaging over all twenty SC types. For the
general, orientation-dependent probability densities the
sparse data correction can be written as

P ij

corr(r, φ, θ) =

Pref (r, φ, θ)

1
1 + m′σ
m′σ
1 + m′σ

+

P ij(r, φ, θ)

(12)

where P ij are the actual probability densities obtained
from the database for the ij pair of side chains, P ij
corr
are the corrected probabilities, and Pref is the reference
probability density. A modiﬁcation introduced by the
orientational dependence in our case is that the num-
ber of measurements m becomes m′ = m/sin(θk), as k
equiangular intervals are used for the θ angle. This is
necessary for accounting for the azimuthal dependence
of volume elements in spherical coordinates. The σ pa-
rameter is a constant that controls how many actual mea-
surements m′ must be observed so that both the actual
probabilities and the reference would have equal weights.
As in other studies, we used the value σ = 1/508,27,30.

2. Residue-Residue Interaction Probability Maps

Using our proposed deﬁnitions of residue-speciﬁc lo-
cal reference frames (introduced in section II B) and the
histogram extraction procedure (described in detail in
Appendix ), we constructed radial and orientational SC-
SC interaction probability maps. All the combinations
of side chain types were investigated. From the normal-
ized angular histograms, the resulting probability den-
sity maps for residue-residue interactions were calculated.
For purpose of illustration, the data shown in all the
probability density maps presented in this paper were
obtained by averaging over the entire distance range
for which the radial and angular histograms were con-
structed (2˚A to 26˚A), as explained above.

FIG. 5: Orientational probability density maps for all-all,
H-all, LH-all and P-all interactions. Here “all”, “H”, “LH”,
and “P” are virtual residues. The “all” type is obtained by
averaging over all the observed SC-SC orientations. “H” is ob-
tained by averaging over the ﬁve highly hydrophobic amino
acids (Ile, Val, Leu, Phe, Met), “LH” corresponds to the av-
erage of eight less hydrophobic residues (Ala, Gly, Cys, Trp,
Tyr, Pro, Thr, Ser), and “P” is obtained by averaging over
seven highly hydrophilic amino acids (His, Glu, Asn, Gln,
Asp, Lys and Arg)39,40. The hydropathic properties and ef-
fects due to the ﬁnite size of proteins are clearly reﬂected in
these maps. The probability amplitudes correspond to the
bar scale shown, with units of 10

−3.

The orientational probability maps for interactions be-
tween Ile (one of the most hydrophobic residues) and Arg
(highly hydrophilic) are shown in Fig. 4 together with a
schematic representation of their associated LRFs. The
LRFs in Fig. 4 are shown in the proximity of the Cα,
to illustrate the computational process of constructing
them for actual structures. However, for calculations the
LRFs are translated such that their origin corresponds
to the geometrical center of the heavy atoms in the side
chains (i.e.
the interaction centers Si). The orienta-
tional anisotropy is stronger around Arg than around Ile
(Fig. 4), which is possibly due to the relatively longer
Arg side chain. Lys, another strong hydrophilic residue,
presents a relative orientational interaction probability
map similar to Arg but with an even stronger anisotropic
character. The similarity between the Ile-Ile and Ile-Arg
maps and between the Arg-Ile and Arg-Arg is largely a
reﬂection of the fact that the statistical data collected
here does not depend on the relative orientation of the
second side chain (SCj) in the reference system of the
ﬁrst SC (LRFi). This ﬁnding may be a consequence of
the assumptions behind Eq. 9.

The most noticeable diﬀerence between the maps cal-
culated in the LRFs of Ile and Arg is that the relative
amplitudes of the interaction probabilities at the “poles”
are reversed. In other words, the most preferred interac-
tion loci for Ile is around its “north pole” (i.e. towards
the positive Oz axis, away from the local backbone) while
for Arg is in the proximity of its “south pole”. To investi-
gate if this feature is due to the hydrophobic/hydrophilic

8

character, we computed average orientational interaction
probability maps for three groups of residues: (a) ﬁve
highly hydrophobic (H) residues Ile, Val, Leu, Phe, Met,
(b) eight less hydrophobic (LH) residues Ala, Gly, Cys,
Trp, Tyr, Pro, Thr, Ser, and (c) seven highly hydrophilic
(P ) residues His, Glu, Asn, Gln, Asp, Lys and Arg.
This classiﬁcation was suggested by various hydropathy
scales39,40. The computed average maps are presented
in Fig. 5 together with the maps for the average virtual
residue “all”.

The “all-all” map shows that, for any residue there is a
slightly higher probability to ﬁnd more residues along the
attached negative Oz axis in their respective LRFs than
in the “northern hemisphere”. The deﬁnition of the LRFs
was made such that the positive Oz direction points away
from the nearest backbone atoms. Due to the ﬁnite size
and the relatively compact three-dimensional shapes of
most proteins analyzed here, we do expect to ﬁnd less
residues in that direction for higher SC-SC distances and,
therefore, at larger distances from the backbone. How-
ever, the “H-all” map (Fig. 5) shows that the highly hy-
drophobic amino acids present the reverse situation: a
higher average probability to ﬁnd other residues at the
“north pole” of their side chains. This arises because such
residues are mostly found in the “interior” of proteins,
“protected” from water. The same arguments apply to
the observation that, on average, the highly hydrophilic
residues have preferential coordination loci shown on the
“P-all” map in the proximity of their “south pole”, as it
is expected that their positive Oz axis points more of-
ten toward the water molecules. It is reassuring that the
average over the less hydrophobic residues, shown in the
“LH-all” map of Fig. 5, does not reﬂect the existence of
signiﬁcant orientational preferences.

III. RESULTS: HOW IMPORTANT IS THE
INFORMATION ON RELATIVE
RESIDUE-RESIDUE ORIENTATIONS?

We performed tests using the distance and orientation
dependent statistical potentials (UDO) as scoring func-
tions and we assessed their performance on a standard
database of decoys developed by Samudrala and Levitt28.
The results are compared with respect to the perfor-
mance of potentials dependent solely on distance (UD).
Similar decoy tests have been shown to be useful in ana-
lyzing the ability of various potential schemes to correctly
recognize the native state17,41. There are two main as-
pects that need to be taken into consideration when using
decoy protein structures for tests: (1) The energy of the
native state should be as low as possible, and (2) The
decoy structure that has the lowest root mean square Cα
distance (RMSD) from the native state should also have
a low energy17,41,42. For studying these aspects from a
quantitative point of view, we use the Z-score for both
the energy (ZE) and the RMSD deviations of the decoy
structures (ZRMSD). The deﬁnition of these two types

of Z-scores is illustrated in Fig. 6 where the distance-
dependent energies (UD) that we computed for the set of
654 decoys of Calbindin (3icb), is plotted as a function
of the Cα RMSD, calculated with respect to the native
state. The Z-score of a statistical quantity x is

Z =

x − x
σ

(13)

where σ is the standard deviation and x is the mean of
the distribution of x values. In our case, we use x both
as the energy and the RMSD of the set of decoys.
In
all cases, a good scoring function will lead to a nega-
tive Z-score. In Fig. 6, we show the radial energy term
computed using our method for the Calbidin decoy set
(3icb in28). The high similarity between this plot and
the energies depicted in Fig. 1 of Samudrala and Levitt28
conﬁrms that the present radial potentials are essentially
the same as those used by other groups. In this ﬁgure,
the circle shows the position of the native state and the
diamond shows the position of the decoy structure that
has the lowest energy. For a potential (or scoring func-
tion) that is eﬃcient in discriminating the native state
of a protein from a set of decoys it is expected that (1)
the native state (circle) corresponds to the lowest inter-
action energy, and (2) the decoy with the lowest energy
(diamond) should have as small an RMSD as possible.
Both criteria are important and we ﬁnd that both the
ZE and ZRMSD scores deﬁned here are useful, quantita-
tive measures of the performance of the potential energy
function. These Z-scores are proportional to the distance
of the corresponding parameter of interest (depicted in
Fig. 6 as interrupted lines) from the mean values of their
distributions (solid lines), in units of standard deviations

σ.

Due to the large number and diversity of decoy sets
that are employed in this paper, we do not repeat the
speciﬁc description of the methods used for generating
each decoy set and of their names (e.g. “single”,“lmds”,
“ﬁsa”, etc.). That information is provided by the “De-
coys ‘R’ Us” database (http://dd.stanford.edu) and by
the corresponding publications28. Details are provided
for the decoys that are relevant to the results obtained
for our tests.

In Fig. 7 are compared total statistical potential val-
ues obtained for distance-only dependent potentials (UD,
squares), and for distance and orientation dependent po-
tentials (UDO, circles) for decoy structures in the “single”
sets (“misfold” and “pdb error”) of the “Decoys ‘R’ Us”
database28.

The “misfold” set contains, for each native protein,
an alternative structure generated by placing the same
sequences on diﬀerent folds with the same number of
residues (e.g. the “1bp2on2paz” notation means that the
“1bp2” sequence has been placed on the “2paz” fold28).
The incorrect structures in the “pdb error” set are exper-
imental structures that have been substantially re-reﬁned
or found to contain errors. The points united by dotted
lines (ﬁlled symbols) correspond to incorrect structures,
while the continuous lines (open symbols) join scores ob-
tained for correct states (i.e. “native” for the “misfold”
set, and “latest” for the “pdb error” set). The arrow in
Fig. 7 emphasizes the case where the UD score fails to
identify the native state, while UDO succeeds. Overall,
the “single” decoy sets proved to be relative easy tests for
both the UD and UDO scores. The orientation dependent
UDO scores consistently result in better (i.e. smaller) val-
ues for the correct protein structures in all cases studied.
In all the tests performed, some of the decoy sets that
were not appropriate for analysis were eliminated. For
example, non-standard side chains were present in the
decoys or in the native structures, for which no UDO po-
tentials were constructed. Another reason for eliminating
a few structures was the absence of enough heavy atom
coordinates in some of their large side chains. This pre-
vented the construction of LRFs for those side chain and,
therefore, the correct estimation of their UDO potentials.
Much more challenging decoy tests than the ones pre-
sented above for the “single” decoys can be performed
using the “multiple” decoy sets from the “Decoys ‘R’ Us”
database28. The main goal of these tests is to identify the
native structure from a set of many (i.e. tens, hundreds,
or even thousands) of decoys. We discuss next the re-
sults of these tests using the ZE and Cα RMSD Z-scores
deﬁned as shown in Fig. 6. From the “multiple” decoy
sets available in the “Decoys ‘R’ Us” database, the “lat-
tice” set was eliminated from the analysis presented here
because the new UDO statistical potentials used in this
paper were constructed using a training set of real, non-
homologous protein structures. The speciﬁc constraints
imposed by the tetrahedral lattice topology on side chain
conformations for the “lattice” decoys aﬀect more nega-

FIG. 7: Results of tests on the “single” decoy sets28 that consist of pairs of correct (i.e. native) and incorrect structures.
The plot compares the total statistical potential values obtained for distance-only dependent potentials (UD, squares), and for
distance and orientation dependent potentials (UDO, circles). The points united by dotted lines (ﬁlled symbols) correspond to
incorrect structures, while the continuous lines join scores obtained for correct states (open symbols). The arrow emphasizes
a case where the UD score fails to identify the native state, while UDO succeeds. These types of tests, concerned with
discriminating the native state from a single decoy, are relatively easy and both the UD and UDO scores succeed to identify the

tively the performance of the UDO potentials than the
performance of the distance-only dependent scores, UD.
In Fig. 8 are shown energy (ZE) and Cα RMSD Z-
scores (ZRMSD) calculated for the multiple decoy sets
“lmds”, “ﬁsa casp3”, “ﬁsa” and “4state”28. Z-scores cal-
culated for the distance-only dependent statistical po-
tentials UD (dark bars) and for the new UDO potential
(white bars) values are compared. In Fig. 8, and in all
the subsequent ﬁgures presenting Z-scores, more nega-
tive values are better, and the cases in which UDO gives
better results than using UD are emphasized using ar-
rows. It is observed that in a large number of cases the
inclusion of orientational information improves the per-
formance of both ZE and ZRMSD scores. An especially
interesting case is the one of the “lmds” set in which
all-atom distance dependent scores were shown to per-
form poorly28,43.
In this case, when both the ZE and
ZRMSD Z-scores are considered, the new distance- and
orientation-dependent potentials UDO performed much
better than the distance-only dependent UD in a major-
ity of cases.

In Figs. 9-11 are shown the corresponding results for
the “hg structal”, “ig structal hires” and “ig structal”
decoy sets of the “Decoys ‘R’ Us” database. For the

“hg structal” decoy sets of globins,
improvements are
observed in about a third of the test cases. However,
for both the “ig structal hires” and “ig structal” decoy
sets of immunoglobulins, more than 70% of tests present
an improvement in the performance the energy Z-scores
when UDO potentials are employed (ZE(UDO)).

The results for all the sets of “multiple” decoy tests
are summarized in Table II. As mentioned above,
particularly strong improvements are observed when
using UDO for the “lmds” set,
for which distance-
dependent scoring functions were reported before to have
a weak performance28,43. The very good energy Z-scores
(ZE(UDO) < ZE(UD) for more than 70% of the de-
coy sets) that were obtained for the large decoy sets of
immunoglobulins (“ig structal” and “ig structal hires”)
suggest that considering the orientational dependence
(UDO) in the cases of proteins with a signiﬁcant β-sheet
architecture it is more important than for proteins that
are mainly α-helical (e.g. the “hg structal” sets). At the
same time, the fact that UDO improves both Z-scores in
about a third of the “hg structal” decoy tests, could be
explained by the globular shape of these predominantly
α-helical structures. These results agree to the rather
intuitive observation that details about the relative side

FIG. 8: The energy (ZE) and Cα RMSD Z-scores (ZRM SD) calculated for the multiple decoy sets “lmds”, “ﬁsa casp3”, “ﬁsa”
and “4state”28. The numbers in brackets represent the number of decoys in each set, including the native structure. Z-scores
calculated using statistical potentials dependent only on distance UD (dark bars) and distance and orientation dependent
potentials (UDO, white) are compared. More negative Z-scores are better, and the cases in which UDO gives better results
than using UD are emphasized by the arrows on the left. When both ZE and ZRM SD Z-scores are considered, the inclusion of
orientational information improves the performance in a majority of cases.

chain orientations could play a more signiﬁcant role in
compact, globular proteins than in proteins with rela-
tively extended chains. Overall, it is shown that, for a
majority of test cases, the ZE and the ZRMSD Z-scores
are improved by including the relative SC-SC orienta-
tions in the structure analysis. This demonstrates that
the performance of the statistical potentials in discrim-
inating the native state is signiﬁcantly enhanced by the
inclusion of orientation dependent information.

The results of the Z-score calculations for the de-
coy sets analyzed in this paper show that there are
cases where the more detailed, distance- and orientation-
dependent potentials (UDO) do not provide a better per-
formance in discriminating the native state as compared
to using simple distance-dependent potentials (UDO).
Since both the UDO and UD potentials employed here
were extracted from the same protein database and for
the same number of radial bins, it is expected that the
UDO values, while more detailed, are at the same time
more prone to statistical errors than the UD potentials.
The sparse data correction procedure ensures that rea-
sonable values are employed for situations when little or
no speciﬁc statistical data on relative residue-residue dis-
tances and orientations is available. However, this pro-
cedure alone can only ensure that realistic, accurate sta-

structures employed here (and in20) for extracting the

FIG. 9: Energy (ZE) and Cα RMSD Z-scores (ZRM SD) calculated for the multiple decoy sets “hg structal”28. The numbers
in brackets represent the number of decoys in each set, including the native structure. Z-scores calculated using statistical
potentials dependent only on distance (UD, dark bars) and distance and orientation dependent potentials (UDO, white bars)
are compared. More negative Z-scores are better. The cases in which UDO gives better results than using UD are emphasized
by the arrows on the left.

residues are also factors that could inﬂuence the relative
performance of the UDO and UD potentials. A useful
quantitative parameter that is directly related to the type
of protein architecture is the contact order (CO)44,45,46
of a protein structure. The CO deﬁnition employed here
is

CO =

∆Si,j

(14)

1
Nc

Nc

<i,j>
X

where Nc is the total number of contacts and ∆Si,j is
the sequence separation, in residues, between contacting
residues i and j. Two residues are considered to be in
contact when |i − j| > 1 and any of the heavy atoms
of residue i is within 3.75 ˚A of any of the heavy atoms
of residue j47. When the CO is small the protein struc-
ture presents mostly local contacts (i.e. |i − j| < 6), and
when CO is larger, the contacts are nonlocal44,46. As
shown in Fig. 12a we observed an inverse proportional-
ity between the CO values calculated for all the native
states of the decoys analyzed in this paper and the frac-
tion of local contacts for various protein architectures.
Based on this observation, we investigated the relative
performance of the UDO and UD potentials as a func-
tion of CO values (Fig. 12b) and sequence length (Fig.

12c). In Figs. 12b and 12c is shown the dependence of
the diﬀerence ∆ZE = ZE(UDO) − ZE(UD) for the en-
ergy Z-scores on contact order values (CO) and sequence
length of the native state (N). Negative ∆ZE values cor-
respond to better performing scores for the distance- and
orientation-dependent potentials (UDO). The lines rep-
resent linear ﬁts. While the trends are not very strong, it
is observed that, for the energy Z-scores the novel UDO
statistical potentials perform better then the UD poten-
tials for longer proteins, presenting large contact orders,
such as the β-sheet structures from the “ig structal” and
“ig structal hires” sets.
It is observed that the inclu-
sion of the information on relative SC-SC orientations
makes the current version of the UDO statistical poten-
tials more useful than UD for relatively large, globular
proteins (N > 100 residues), with a signiﬁcant content
of β-sheet structure and nonlocal contacts. At the same
time, it is also observed that even for relatively short
(N < 100 residues) and α-helical proteins (low CO val-
ues), both the ZE and ZRMSD-scores can be improved
when using UDO potentials but for a smaller number of
cases. These results suggest that details about side chain
- backbone interactions should be included in statistical
potentials for short or α-helical proteins with a high con-
tent of local contacts.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

Our results demonstrate that it is possible to im-
prove the performance of energy based scoring functions
by using statistical information extracted from the rela-
tive residue-residue orientations. Calculations of orien-
tational order parameters for investigating the residue
packing in proteins showed that architecture dependent
packing is best described by a linear combination of sim-
ple cluster geometries (fcc, icos, hcp and bcc). This result
reinforces the need for extracting orientation dependent
potentials using PDB structures. We have deﬁned a novel
local reference system for each residue for quantitatively
describing the relative three-dimensional orientations in
a manner that is independent of the neighboring amino
acids. Arguments based on experimental resolution of
protein structures were used to derive the optimal bin
size employed for collecting statistical data with both
angular and distance dependence. The orientational in-
formation has both common and complementary signif-
icance as compared to the information that can be ex-
tracted from the relative residue-residue distances alone.
The tests that we performed on a standard data base of
artiﬁcially generated decoy structures suggest that this
complementarity can be very important for a large class

of protein structures. The novel distance and orientation
dependent statistical potentials were shown to present
an enhanced ability to recognize native-like protein folds,
especially for larger structures with high contact orders
immunoglobulins). They should ﬁnd use in con-
(e.g.
structing the next generation of coarse grained oﬀ-lattice
protein simulations. These new potentials could also be
instrumental in developing more eﬃcient computational
methods for structure prediction on much larger scales
than it is currently possible, addressing one of the ma-
jor goals of proteomics. To achieve this it will be impor-
tant to also include the relative orientations between side
chains and the protein backbone29.

APPENDIX: HISTOGRAM EXTRACTION

Previous studies suggest that only protein structures
that are determined with a resolution of 2˚A or better
should be used in the computation of gij(r)20 from pro-
tein databases3. A resolution of 2˚A for protein struc-
tures that are determined by X-ray crystallography corre-
sponds to an accuracy of +/- 0.2˚A in atomic positions49.
The 2˚A resolution is often good enough to accurately
assign hydrogen bonds and to allow for a limited inter-
pretation of solvent structure.

The high resolution structural data are binned for the
construction of either radial or orientation dependent
pair distributions gij (r) and gij(φ, θ).
It is important,
therefore, to identify the minimal radial and angular bin
sizes that ensure a certain high level of conﬁdence that
the information has been analyzed correctly and that no
important artifacts due to the limitations of the exper-
imental methods have been overlooked.
In building a
statistical distribution, the data that is collected from
protein structures3 consists of inter-atomic distances. We

expect that such data has an accuracy of dR = +/−0.4˚A.
For the radial dependence of the data, let the bin size
be L. In the process of assigning a certain pair distance to
a certain bin, if that value is exactly at the bin boundary,
we have a probability of correct assignment Pca = 0.5.
On the other hand, if the value is exactly in the mid-
dle of the bin, this probability is maximum (if L ≥ 2dR
than Pca = 1). We estimate that the probability of cor-
rect radial assignment depends on the bin size L and the
accuracy dR as

P (L, dR) = 2/L

Pca(x, dR)dx

(A.1)

L/2

Z

This estimate is based on the assumption that the prob-
ability of correct assignment to a certain bin of a certain
pair distance value is directly proportional to the diﬀer-
ence x between that value and the nearest bin boundary,
or that Pca(x, dR) = a + bx. Using the above assumed
conditions for the values of Pca at the bin middle and on
the boundary, we ﬁnd that

Pca(x, dR) = (1 + x/dR)/2 if x < dR
Pca(x, dR) = 1 if x ≥ dR

FIG. 12: (a) The dependence of the percent of local contacts (LC) on the contact order (CO) of the native structures for all
the decoy sets analyzed in this paper. (b) The diﬀerence ∆ZE = ZE(UDO) − ZE(UD) for the energy Z-scores plotted versus
the CO of the native state for each decoy set. (c) ∆ZE plotted versus the number of residues (N) for each decoy set. Negative
∆ZE values correspond to better performing scores for the distance- and orientation-dependent potentials (UDO). The lines,
representing linear ﬁts of ∆ZE, are shown for emphasizing the trends.

Therefore, for the average probability of correct assign-
ment we ﬁnd that

P (L, dR) = 1 −

if L ≥ 2 dR and

P (L, dR) = 0.5 +

if L < 2 dR.

From this result we can infer that for dR = 0.4˚A, if we
choose a radial bin size L = 0.5˚A, the conﬁdence of cor-
rect bin assignment is about 65.6%.
In this work we
employ a radial bin width of L = 1.2˚A. This bin width is
at least twice larger than the values employed by other
authors. However, it ensures that we have a conﬁdence
level of at least 83.3% that the radial bin assignment is
correct.50

Similar considerations are used for studying the an-
gular orientation pair distributions. Consider the polar
coordinate system and the division of the θ and φ values.
We assume that we have N bins in θ and 2N bins in
φ. The solid angle corresponding to one angular bin is
dΩ = 2π/N 2. This solid angle is proportional to the ra-
tio between the area element that insures a certain high
value for the conﬁdence level of correct assignment, and
the square of the corresponding minimum pair distance
(radius) at which we expect that conﬁdence level. Let us
require a conﬁdence level of 80% at a distance of 5˚A. At
larger distances the conﬁdence level will be higher, but it
will decrease at closer ranges. Since dΩ ≈ L2/(R + dR)2,
and L = 1.2˚A, R = 5.0˚A and dR = 0.4˚A, we have
dΩ ≈ 0.222 = 2π/N 2. This reasoning leads us to em-

ploy the nearest even value of N = 12 for the number
of bins that divide the angular interval for θ. Previous
studies19 used a smaller value (N = 3).

The use of a larger radial bin size (1.2˚A vs. 0.5˚A)
than previously suggested, is needed to ensure a high
conﬁdence level (at least 83.3%) of correct radial bin as-
signment. Here, we employ twenty radial distance bins
with L = 1.2˚A for distances starting at 2˚A. When we
collect statistical data on the relative 3-dimensional ori-
entation of pairs of residues, we obtain a similarly high

conﬁdence level by using N = 12 for θ and N = 24 for φ.
All the calculations presented in this section are based
on the assumption that all protein structures analyzed
have a resolution of 2˚A or better. If proteins of diﬀer-
ent structural resolution are analyzed, the optimal bin
size can be estimated accordingly. These arguments as-
sure that optimal radial and angular bin sizes (i.e. values
that are small enough to provide a good resolution, yet
large enough to correspond to a high statistical conﬁ-
dence level) are employed.

Abstract

For closed-shell systems, the local density approximation (LDA) and the LYP, BLYP, and B3LYP

functionals are shown to be compatible with reference-state one-particle density-matrix theory,

where this recently introduced formalism is based on Brueckner-orbital theory and an energy

functional that includes exact exchange and a non-universal correlation-energy functional. The

method is demonstrated to reduce to a density functional theory when the exchange-correlation

energy-functional has a simpliﬁed form, i.e., its integrand contains only the coordinates of two

electron, say r1 and r2, and it has a Dirac delta function δ(r1 − r2) as a factor. Since Brueckner

and Hartree–Fock orbitals are often very similar, any local exchange functional that works well

with Hartree–Fock theory is a reasonable approximation with reference-state one-particle density-

matrix theory. The LDA approximation is also a reasonable approximation. However, the Colle–

Salvetti correlation-energy functional, and the LYP variant, are not ideal for the method, since

these are universal functionals. Nevertheless, they appear to provide reasonable approximations.

The B3LYP functional is derived using a linear combination of two functionals: One is the BLYP

functional; the other uses exact exchange and a correlation-energy functional from the LDA.

INTRODUCTION

The Kohn-Sham version of density functional theory (DFT) plays a major role in both

quantum chemistry and condensed matter physics [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. The local density

approximation (LDA) [8] has been widely used for the solid state, while for molecules, the

most successful functional, a hybrid one [9, 10, 11, 12], is known as B3LYP [9, 13], where this

functional contains three parameters, two correlation-energy functionals, the Dirac-exchange

functional with the a correction, and exact exchange. The LYP correlation-energy functional

[14] – a key component of B3LYP – is derived from the Colle–Salvetti correlation-energy

functional [15].

Recently, a density-matrix formalism was developed called reference-state one-particle

density-matrix theory [16, 17]. This method employs generalized Hartree–Fock equations

containing the exact exchange-potential and a nonlocal correlation-potential, where these

equations are obtained using the Brillouin-Brueckner condition (for non-variational energy

functionals) or functional minimization (for variational functionals). The method uses en-

ergy functionals that yield the target-state energy when the reference state – or its cor-

responding one-particle density-matrix – is constructed from Brueckner orbitals. Unlike

traditional DFT approaches, the v-representable problem does not appear in the method,

nor the need to introduce functionals deﬁned by a constrained search. The correlation-

energy functionals in the method are non-universal, in the sense that they depend on the

external potential. Nevertheless, model systems can still be used to derive universal energy-

functionals. For example, the Colle–Salvetti functional was shown to be compatible with

the method as well as a one-particle-density-matrix variant of the LDA. In addition, using

time-independent many-body perturbation theory [18, 19], diagrammatic expansions were

given for the non-variational correlation-energy functionals that are expressed in terms of

orbitals and orbital energies. When restrictions are placed on the orbital energies, the in-

dividual diagrams are shown to explicitly depend on the one-particle density-matrix of the

reference state (and the external potential).

Below we demonstrate that for systems that can be treated with a simpliﬁed exchange-

correlation energy-functional – leading to a local exchange-correlation potential – the

reference-state one-particle density-matrix formalism reduces to a density functional for-

malism, where the density that appears within the method is the one from the reference

2

state, and not the target state. This approach diﬀers in this way and in others from the

formalism by Lindgren and Salomonson [20], where their method is a generalization of the

Hartree–Fock Kohn–Sham approach [21] and yields orbitals that are believed to be very

similar to Brueckner orbitals.

The DFT functionals derived from a uniform electron gas are also shown to be compatible

with the reference-state one-particle density-matrix theory, where this compatibility appears

because the density of the target state for a uniform electron gas is the same as the density

of the reference state and, also, the plane-wave states are Brueckner orbitals. In additional,

functionals that approximates the exact exchange-energy can also be used, since the exact

exchange-functional for Brueckner orbital theory, Hartree–Fock theory, and DFT are the

same. Furthermore, functionals derived using the one-particle density-matrix of the reference

state are compatible, assuming the errors due to the external potential are small – if the

functional is a universal one. Using these observations, the LDA, and the BLYP and B3LYP

functionals are shown to be compatible with the reference-state one-particle density-matrix

formalism. This puts these functionals within an alternative DFT approach that avoids, for

the most part, existence theorems and constraint searches.

II. REFERENCE–STATE ONE–PARTICLE DENSITY–MATRIX THEORY

We seek an eigenfunction |Ψi on the time-independent Hamiltonian operator:

H =

[i|(− 1

where the integrals are written using chemist’s notation [22]:

X

and the spatial and spin coordinates, r and ω, are denoted collectively by x. The eigenfunc-

tion of interest, or target state |Ψi, yields the electronic energy E:

Consider a single-determinantal reference-state, say |Φi, where this state is a ﬁrst-order

approximation of the target state; the ﬁrst-order energy is

(1)

(2)

(3)

(4)

E =

hΨ|H|Ψi
hΨ|Ψi

.

E1[Φ] = hΦ|H|Φi.

Adding and subtracting E1[Φ] on the left side of Eq. (3), gives

E = E1 + (E − E1) = E1[Φ] + Eco[Φ],

where this Eq. deﬁnes the correlation energy Eco[Φ] as (E − E1).

There is a one-to-one correspondence between determinant states and their one-particle

density-matrices [2, 23], where these density-matrices γ are given by [24, 25, 26, 27, 28]

γ(x, x′) =

ψw(x)ψ∗

w(x′); γ ←→ |Φi,

Xw∈{ψo→Φ}

and the notation on the right-hand-side indicates the one-to-one correspondence; further-

more, the sum over w includes only the occupied orbitals of the reference state |Φi: This

orbital set is denoted by {ψo → Φ}; the unoccupied set is denoted by {ψu → Φ}. Un-

less stated otherwise, two sets of occupied or unoccupied orbitals that diﬀer by a unitary

transformation are considered equivalent.

Because of the one-to-one correspondence mentioned above, any functional that depends

on the reference state |Φi can be transformed into one that depends on the one-particle

density-matrix γ. For example, by requiring the external potential v(r) to be a spin-free

operator, the ﬁrst-order energy can be written as

E1[γ] =

− 1

2∇2

r γ(x, x′)

=xdx +

v(r)γ(x, x) dx + EJ[γ] + Ex[γ],

and, henceforth, an integration over x implies an integration over r and a summation over ω.

Let the Fock operator be denoted ˆFγ; the functional derivative of the ﬁrst-order energy

E1[γ] gives the kernel of this operator [2]:

δEx[γ]
δγ(x2, x1)

(11)

and this function is the kernel of the exchange operator, denoted by ˆvγ
x.

Minimizing the functional E1[γ], subject to the constraint that the one-particle density-

matrix comes from a single-determinantal state, yields E1[˜τ ], where ˜τ is the one-particle
density-matrix of the Hartree–Fock reference-state | ˜Θi:

˜τ (x, x′) =

ψw(x)ψ∗

w(x′),

(12)

Xw∈{ψo→ ˜Θ}

and this density-matrix satisﬁes the following condition:

hψr| ˆF˜τ |ψwi = 0; ψw ∈ {ψo → ˜τ }, ψr ∈ {ψu → ˜τ },

(13a)

and the right-hand-side notation indicates that ψw is a member of the set of occupied orbital
that determines ˜τ (and | ˜Θi); ψr is unoccupied. The operator form of this Eq. is

(cid:0)
where the identity operator ˆ1, using a Hartree–Fock basis set, is given by

ˆF˜τ ˜τ = 0,

ˆ1 =

|ψwihψw| +

|ψrihψr|.

Xw∈{ψo→˜τ }

Xr∈{ψu→˜τ }

A unique set of occupied and unoccupied orbitals is obtained by requiring the occupied

and unoccupied blocks of ˆF˜τ to be diagonal:

ˆF˜τ ψ˜τ

w(x) = ε˜τ

w(x), ψ˜τ

w ∈ {ψo → ˜τ },

{ψ˜τ

The orbitals sets that satisfy Eqs. (13) and (15) are denoted by {ψ˜τ
u ← ˜τ , ˆF˜τ }, indicating that they are uniquely determined by ˜τ and ˆF˜τ .
Substituting Eq. (10) into Eqs. (15) gives the canonical Hartree–Fock Eqs:

B. Variational Brueckner orbital theory

Brueckner orbital theory [20, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43] is

a generalization of Hartree–Fock theory that utilizes a single-determinantal state that has

the maximum overlap with the target state [44, 45]. We now review a variant of Brueckner

orbital theory that is used to derive the reference-state one-particle density-matrix theory

[17].

In this previous work, we introduced four trial wavefunctions – say |Ψ(η)

Φ i, where (η =
I, II, III, and IV) – that are deﬁned with respect to a single-determinantal reference-state

|Φi. The ﬁrst trial-wavefunction |Ψ(I)

Φ i is simply the target state of interest, |Ψi, with the

single excitations removed:

where the projector for the singly-excited states is

and the singly-excited state are

raw|Φi; ψw ∈ {ψo → Φ}, ψr ∈ {ψu → Φ}.

The P Φ

11 subspace is completely determined by |Φi; P Φ

11 is also invariant to a unitary trans-

formation of occupied, or virtual, orbitals [36].

The second trial-wavefunction |Ψ(II)

by an exponential ansatz: (|Ψi = eSΦ|Φi), where |Ψ(II)

excitation amplitudes SΦ

Φ i is deﬁned with respect to the target state expressed
Φ i is generated by removing the single-

The third trial-wavefunction |Ψ(III)

Φ i can be generated by its wave-operator:

that can be expressed in an exponential form: ( ˆΩΦ = e ˆSΦ|Φi), where ˆSΦ can be written as
a sum n-body excitations, with the exclusion of a one-body operator:

The wave operator ˆΩΦ is as a solution to the coupled cluster equations [18, 19, 46, 47, 48,

49, 50, 51, 52, 53] with the single excitation portion removed:

(cid:17)

where only the open (op) and connected (cn) portions enter into the relation. This expression

deﬁnes the trial functional |Ψ(III)

Φ i using Eq. (21).

The fourth trial wavefunctions |Ψ(IV)

Φ i is not considered here, except to mention that it is
obtained by solving the conﬁguration-interaction equations [19, 22, 54] in an approximate

way, i.e., by neglecting the single-excitation portion.

(P Φ

All of the trial states |Ψ(η)

Φ i share the property that they contain no single excitations. i.e.,
Φ i = 0), and they generate the target state |Ψi when their reference state satisﬁes
(|Φi = |Θi), where |Θi is the determinantal state constructed from occupied Bruckner

11|Ψ(η)

orbitals. In other words, we have

|Ψ(η)

Θ i = |Ψi.

Because of the one-to-one correspondence mentioned above, the trial wavefunctions de-

pend on the one-particle density-matrix; so we can write |Ψ(η)

γ i. Using this notation, we can

deﬁne variational energy-functionals that depend on the one-particle density-matrix:

(23)

(25)

¯Eη[γ] =

hΨ(η)

γ |H|Ψ(η)
γ i
hΨ(η)

= E1[γ] + ¯E (η)

co [γ],

where the last relation deﬁnes the correlation-energy functionals ¯E (η)

co [γ] as ( ¯Eη[γ] − E1[γ]).

Substituting Eq. (7) into Eqs. (5) and (25) gives the following:

co [γ].

¯E (η)

(27a)

(27b)

We now generalize many of the Hartree–Fock relations from the previous subsection
simply by replacing E1[γ] with ¯Eη[γ] and the Fock operator ˆFγ with generalized, or exact,
Fock operators, ˆζ (η)
γ .

The functional derivative of our energy functionals yield two-body functions that serve

as the kernels of the exact Fock operators:

12 γ(x1, x2),

where the last relation uses Eqs. (27b) and (11).

We now require the target state to be a ground state; using the variation theorem and
Eq. (24), the minimizing of the functionals ¯Eη[γ] – subject to the constraint that the one-

particle density-matrix comes from a single-determinantal state – yields

and from Eqs. (26) and (27) we have

E = ¯Eη[τ ],

Eco[τ ] = ¯E (η)

co [τ ],

Exc[τ ] = ¯E (η)

xc [τ ],

where τ is the one-particle density-matrix of the Brueckner reference-state |Θi:

τ (x, x′) =

w(x′),

Xw∈{ψo→Θ}

and the Brueckner orbitals satisfy the following equivalent conditions:

where these orbitals do not depend of η – any trial wavefunction gives the same results.

III. CLOSED-SHELL CASE

Our interest here is in cases where the Hamiltonian is spin-free – it contains no spin

coordinates – and the target state |Ψi is a ground-state singlet that is well described by a

closed-shell reference-state |Φi. In these cases – and many others – it is appropriate to use

a set of spatially restricted orbitals, given by

ψjσ(x) = χj(r)σ(ω); σ = α, β,

(37)

so that |Φi is determined by a set of doubly-occupied spatial orbitals, denoted by {χo→ Φ},

where this set also determines the virtual set, denoted by {χu→ Φ}. Two sets of orbitals

that diﬀer by a unitary transformation are, again, considered equivalent.

By deﬁnition, the spinless, one-particle density-matrix is given by [2, 28]

ρ1(r1, r2) =

γ(r1, ω; r2, ω),

ω
X

and from Eqs. (37) and (6) with (w = xσ) we have

ρ1(r1, r2) = 2

χx(r1)χ∗

x(r2); ρ1 ←→ |Φi.

Xx∈{χo→Φ}

By using the restricted orbitals deﬁned by Eq. (37), it is easily demonstrated that the one-

particle density-matrix γ is determined by the spinless one, as indicated by the following

relation:

γ(x1, x2) =

ρ1(r1, r2)δω1ω2.

Hence, any functional of γ now becomes a functional of ρ1. In particular, for a spin-free

Hamiltonian, the spin-variable summations are easily performed, yielding explicit functionals

(38)

of ρ1. For example, the electronic energy and our energy-functionals, Eqs. (5) and (25), can

¯Eη[ρ1] = E1[ρ1] + ¯E (η)

B. Brueckner orbital theory

We now generalize many of the Hartree–Fock relations from the previous subsection

simply by replacing the exchange operator ˆvγ

x with the exchange-correlation operator ˆν γη
xc .

For the closed shell case under consideration, it can be easily demonstrated that the

kernels of the exchange-correlation operators are given by [55]

xc (x1, x2) = ν ρ1η
ν γη

xc (r1, r2)δω1,ω2.

Therefore, for an arbitrary function, say φ, we have

xc φ(x1) = ˆν ρ1η
ˆν γη

xc φ(x1),

where ν γη

xc (x1, x2) and ν ρ1η

xc (r1, r2) serve as the kernels of ˆν γη

xc and ˆν ρ1η

xc , respectively.

Using Eqs. (60) and (40), the kernel of the exact Fock operators, Eq. (28), can be written

γ (x1, x2) = δω1ω2ζ (η)

IV. APPROXIMATIONS

The target state |Ψi can be generated from a reference state |Φi by its wave-operator ΩΦ:

|Ψi = ΩΦ|Φi = |ΨΦi + |ΨΦ,Θi,

(72)

where we have partitioned the target state into two terms:

|ΨΦi and |ΨΦ,Θi. Consider

the diagrammatic perturbation-expansion for ΩΦ|Φi, |ΨΦ,Θi is then deﬁned as the sum of

all diagrammatic terms from the perturbation expansion that must vanish for any external

potential when the reference state is the Brueckner one:

|ΨΘ,Θi = 0.

(73)

Hence, |ΨΦi is a trial wavefunction that fulﬁlls all of the requirements of the ones considered

in Sec. II B; furthermore, by our deﬁnition, |ΨΦi is the best trial wavefunction, since it

contains no extra terms that must vanish when (|Φi = |Θi).

Consider a system with an external potential, say v′, where its correlation energy Eco

is known when the reference state is the Brueckner one with a corresponding one-particle

density-matrix of τ ′; using Eq. (31) we have

Eco[τ ′, v′] = ¯Eco[τ ′, v′],

(74)

13

where the correlation-energy functional from |ΨΦi is denoted by ¯Eco and we have indicated

that these functionals depend on the external potential. Hence, a reasonable approximation
for ¯Eco at other potentials v and one-particle density-matrices γ is given by

(75)

(76)

(77)

(78)

Now consider the four trial wavefunctions which can also be obtained using a wave oper-

ator:

¯Eco[γ, v] = Eco[τ ′, v′](τ ′=γ,v′=v).

|Ψ(η)

Φ i = Ω(η)

Φ |Φi,

where from the previous notation we have (Ω(III)

Φ = ˜ΩΦ). Consider the ﬁrst two cases:
(η = I and II), where the wave-operators expansion are easily obtained by considering Lind-

gren’s formalism [18, 51, 56]. By examining this expansion, it is readily seen that the trial
wavefunctions contain terms, say |Ψ(η)

Φ,Θi, that, by necessity, vanish when (|Φi = |Θi):

Hence, even though the approximation (75) is reasonable for (η = I and II):

|Ψ(η)

Φ i = |Ψ(η)

Φ i + |Ψ(η)

Φ,Θi.

¯E (η)

co [γ, v] = Eco[τ ′, v′](τ ′=γ,v′=v),

it neglects the contribution to ¯E (η)

co arising from |Ψ(η)

Φ,Θi.

The wave operator diagrams for (η = III) are more complicated to describe and are given

elsewhere [55]. However, it is obvious from the previous work [17] that the term |Ψ(III)

Φ,Θi is
considerably smaller in magnitude than for (η = I and II), suggesting that the approximation

(78) is reasonable, where this type of approximation was considered previously [17]. It is

quite possible that |Ψ(III)

Φ,Θi is zero, so, in that case (|Ψ(III)
presumed to be true [17], but it was not discussed in detail.

Φ i = |ΨΦi), this was previously

The wave-operator diagrams for (η = IV) contain unlinked terms and will not be consid-

ered, except to mention that |Ψ(IV)

Φ,Θi is nonzero.

A. Local Density Approximation

The correlation energy of an electron gas – denoted by E (gas)

– is given by the correlation

co

energy Eco for a system where the external potential v is constant. Since the orbitals for an

14

electron gas are Brueckner, and using Eq. (31), we have

E (gas)
co

[τg] = Eco[τg, v] = ¯E (η)

co [τg, v], v = const,

(79)

where τg is the one-particle density-matrix that is from the Brueckner reference-state of an

electron gas, say |Θgi, where the Brueckner orbitals, deﬁning |Θgi, are given by plane waves

when periodic boundary conditions are imposed; furthermore, the correlation energy Eco is

unchanged if v is changed by a constant amount; E (gas)

[τg] does not depend on v. (A constant

co

shift in v does, however, shift the ﬁrst-order energy E1.)

The electron-gas approximation for the third correlation-energy functional utilizes this

functional, and it is given by [17]:

¯E (III)

co [γ] ≈ E (gas)

co

[τg](τg =γ),

and this approximation is a special case of Eq. (78), where there are no terms involving
an external potential. (We can also use this approximation for ¯Eco deﬁned in the previous

subsection.)

For spatially restricted orbitals, given by Eq. (37), the above Eq. becomes

¯E (III)

co [ρ1] ≈ E (gas)

co

[̺1g](̺1g =ρ1),

where ̺1g is the spin-less, one-particle density-matrix of the Brueckner reference-state for

an electron gas:

τg(x1, x2) =

̺1g(r1, r2)δω1ω2.

For a uniform electron gas, Eq. (82) is denoted by

τug(x1, x2) =

̺1ug(r1, r2)δω1ω2,

1
2

1
2

and the density that is from the Brueckner, one-particle reference-state of a uniform electron

gas, say |Θugi, is given by

and this density is constant, i.e., it does not depend on r; furthermore, we have

where nug is the density from the target state, say |Ψugi, of a uniform electron gas:

(80)

(81)

(82)

(83)

(84)

(85)

(86)

̺ug(r) = ̺1ug(r, r),

̺ug = nug,

|Ψ(η)

Θugi = |Ψugi,

15

where we have used Eq. (24).

The correlation energy E (ug)

co of a uniform electron gas depends on the constant density

nug; it is given by the following relation:

where ǫug

co is the correlation-energy per particle and N is the number of particles. Using

Eq. (85) gives

co (nug) = Nǫug
E (ug)

co(nug),

co (̺ug) = Nǫug
E (ug)

co(̺ug).

Following Kohn and Sham [8], but using Eq. (88) instead of (87), we construct the following

functional for an electron gas:

E (gas)
co

[̺g] ≈

̺g(r)ǫug

co(̺g) dr.

Z

This functional can be expressed as one that appears to depend upon the one-particle

density-matrix:

E (gas)
co

[̺1g] ≈

̺1g(r2, r1)δ(r1 − r2)ǫug

co(̺1g(r2, r1)) dr1 dr2,

Z Z

where (̺1g(r, r) = ̺g(r)). Substituting the above expression into Eq. (81) gives

¯E (III)

co [ρ1] ≈

ρ1(r2, r1)δ(r1 − r2)ǫug

co(ρ1(r2, r1)) dr1 dr2.

Z Z
The correlation potential ˆν ρ1η

co is deﬁned by its kernel, given by Eq. (70). Because of the

δ(r1−r2) factor, ˆν ρ1III

co

is a local operator when using the above expressions for ¯E (III)

co ; explicitly,

using the results from Appendix A, we have the following approximate expressions:

¯E (III)

co [ρ1] ≈ Eug

co [ρ] =

ρ(r)ǫug

co(ρ) dr,

ˆν ρ1III
co (r) ≈ ν ug

co(r) =

δEug
co [ρ]
δρ(r)

where, for future reference, these approximations are denoted by Eug

co and ν ug
co.

Using the exchange-energy formula by Dirac for a uniform electron gas, the exchange

portion can be treated in an identical manner as the correlation; this approach yields the

following local exchange-operator and exchange energy:

where Eug

is the corresponding ex-

change potential. The above four expressions are identical to the ones for the LDA of DFT,

except that – in the current approach – ρ is not required to be the density of an exact

wavefunction |Ψi; ρ is only required to be the density of a reference state |Φi, and this is

assured to be the case.

B. The Becke exchange correction

For closed-shell systems that are well described by a single determinant, it is well known
that the Bruckner and Hartree–Fock reference-states, |Θi and | ˜Θi, are usually very simi-

lar. Hence, in these cases, the spinless, one-particle density-matrices from the Brueckner

reference-state, ̺1, is similar to the one from the Hartree–Fock reference state, ˜̺1. There-

fore, an approximate exchange-functional Ex[ρ1] that depends on the density of the reference

state, i.e.,

by

Ex[ρ1] ≈ ˜Ex[ρ],

and is an accurate approximation with the Hartree–Fock approach, is also a reasonable

approximation for the current approach. Of particular interest is the exchange functional

obtained by Becke [57] – where this functional is an approximation of the Hartree–Fock

exchange with empirical parameters ﬁt to atomic systems; explicitly, this functional is given

˜Ex[ρ] = Eug

x [ρ] + ∆E B88

x

[ρ],

where ∆E B88

x

is the Becke exchange correction to the uniform electron-gas term, Eug

x . Since

this correction term contains a gradient dependence, the general form of the functional can

be written using the following integral relation:

By using Eqs. (96) and (97) and the following identity:

˜Ex[ρ] =

Gx(ρ, ∇ρ) dr.

Z

∇1ρ(r1) = [(∇1 + ∇2)ρ1(r2, r1)]r2=r1

we obtain the following approximation:

Ex[ρ1] ≈ Eug

x [ρ] + ∆E B88

Z Z

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

Using this expression for the exchange energy, the exchange potential is local; using the

result from Appendix A and the deﬁnition for vug

ˆvρ1
x (r) ≈ vug

x (r) + vB88

x (r) =

(100)

where this expression deﬁnes vB88

x (r).

C. The LYP Functional

Consider the approximation given by Eq. (78), where (η = III), and the correlation energy

Eco – which is also a functional – is taken to be the one from the helium atom:

¯E (III)

co [γ, v] = Eco[τhe, vhe](τhe=γ, vhe=v),

(101)

where τhe is the Brueckner, one-particle, density-matrix for the helium atom, and vhe is the

external potential for this system. Furthermore, since the Brueckner density-matrix τhe is

approximately equal to the Hartree–Fock one, say ˜τhe, we can write

E (III)

co [γ, v] ≈ Eco[˜τhe, vhe](˜τhe=γ, vhe=v).

(102)

The dominant portion of the correlation energy comes from the electron-repulsion contri-

bution. The portion arising from the external potential is smaller; since v is a one-body

operator, this term is probably treated well as part of the ﬁrst-order energy E1. Therefore,

neglecting to make the substitution for the potential, i.e., (vhe = v), should only yield a

small error:

E (III)

co [γ] ≈ Eco[˜τhe, vhe](˜τhe=γ).

A well known approximation for Eco[˜τhe, vhe] – that is valid for other systems also – is given

by Colle and Salvetti functional [14, 15]:

The above two relations suggest the following approximation:

While this is probably a reasonable approximation, we do have some reservations about it.

In particular, a universal functional is used to approximate one that depends on the external

Eco[˜τhe, vhe] ≈ E cs

co[˜τhe].

E (III)

co [γ] ≈ E cs

co[˜τhe](˜τhe=γ).

(103)

(104)

(105)

potential. This violates, at least, the spirit of the method. We would therefore prefer to use

the approximation given by Eq. (101) or (102). Unfortunately, however, no such functionals

are available. Therefore, let us proceed.

For a closed-shell system, Eq. (105) becomes

¯E (III)

co [ρ1] ≈ Ecs

co[ρ1] = E cs

co[˜̺1he](˜̺1he=ρ1),

(106)

where ˜̺1he is the Hartree–Fock spin-less one-particle density-matrix for the helium atom, and,

for future reference, this approximations is denoted by Ecs

co[ρ1] is
derived by Lee, Parr, and Yang [14] that is equivalent to the one derived by Colle–Salvetti;

co[ρ1]. An expression for Ecs

it has the following form:

Ecs

co[ρ1] =

Gco

1ρ1(r1, r1),

∇1∇2ρ1(r2, r1)

Z

(cid:16)

and using this Eq. and the previous one, we have

(cid:17)

(108)

When the functional derivative is taken to determine the kernel of the correlation potential
co (r1, r2) – as deﬁned by Eq. (70) – and ¯E (III)
ν ρ1III
δ(r2 − r1) term survives; the correlation potential ˆν ρ1III

is approximated by the above relation, the

is a local operator. Denoting this

co

co

approximation by ν CS

co (r), we have

ˆν ρ1III
co (r) ≈ ν CS

co (r).

(109)

Using the exchange potential given by Eq. (100) – or any other local exchange potential

– and the above local correlation operator, the exchange-correlation potential ˆν ρ1η

xc – given

by Eq. (71) – is also local. Therefore, the reference-state |Φi obtained from the following

because of the one-to-one correspondence between one-particle density-matrices and non-

interacting states, all one-particle density-matrices generated from the SCF procedure are
determined by their density, i.e., ρ1(ρ). And since for an SCF computation, these are the
only one-particle density-matrices that are required, we can write

Because of the general form of Ecs

co[ρ1] given by Eq. (107) we need only an expression for
(∇1∇2ρ1(r2, r1))r2=r1. Following Lee, Parr, and Yang, we use the following approximation:

co (r) ≈ ν LYP

co (r) =

δElyp

co [ρ]
δρ(r)

.

(120)

Using these two approximations for Elyp

co (r) yields an identical approach as the
co [ρ] and ˆν ρ1III
LYP method. If, in addition, the Becke exchange functional, given by Eq. (100), is used,

the method is equivalent to the one known as BLYP.

D. The B3LYP Functional

Using Eq. (43b), and the uniform-electron-gas approximation for the correlation-energy

functional, Eq. (92), we obtain an approximate exchange-correlation functional, given by

¯E (III)

xc [ρ1] ≈ Ex[ρ1] + Eug

co [ρ].

(121)

(122)

An alternative approximation is given by the BLYP functional that uses Eqs. (100) and

(119):

¯E (III)

xc [ρ1] ≈ Eug

x [ρ] + ∆E B88

If both of these approximations are reasonable, then so is a linear combination of of the two:

x [ρ] + ∆E B88

x

co [ρ]

where the semi-empirical parameter b is at our disposal. Using the approximation for Eug

By choosing (b = 0.80), (α = 0.90), (β = 1.01), (γ = (1 − βb)(1 − b)−1 = 0.95) we get the

same exchange-correlation energy functional as the one employed in the B3LYP approach.

In particular, we have (b = 1 − a0), (bα = ax), and (bβ = ac), where a0, ax, and ac, are 0.20,

0.72, and 0.81, respectively.

APPENDIX A: DERIVATION OF SOME IDENTITIES

Consider the following density functional:

and a corresponding potential, given by [2, 7, 61]

Ei[ρ] =

Gi(ρ) dr,

Z

vi(r) =

δEi[ρ]
δρ(r)

=

∂Gi(ρ)
∂ρ(r)

.

If the integrand Gi(ρ) does not contain gradient terms, we can express the density functional

as one that appears to depends on the spin-less one-particle density-matrix:

Ei[ρ] = Ei[ρ1] =

δ(r1 − r2)Gi(ρ1) dr1 dr2,

Z Z

and its corresponding operator, denoted by ˆvi, is deﬁned by its kernel, given by

vi(r1, r2) =

= δ(r1 − r2)

δEi[ρ1]
δρ1(r2, r1)

∂Gi(ρ1)
∂ρ1(r2, r1)

.

Operating with ˆvi upon an arbitrary function, φ, and using Eqs. (A2) and (A4), we obtain

the following:

ˆviφ(r1) =

vi(r1, r2)φ(r2) dr2 =

δ(r1 − r2)

Z

=

∂Gi (ρ1(r1, r1))
∂ρ1(r1, r1)

Z
φ(r1) =

∂Gi (ρ(r1))
∂ρ(r1)

∂Gi (ρ1(r2, r1))
∂ρ1(r2, r1)

φ(r2) dr2

φ(r1) = vi(r1)φ(r1).

(A5)

Hence, the potential and operator are identical:

ˆvi = vi(r).

Now let the energy functional have a gradient dependence:

where its corresponding potential is given by [2, 7, 61]

Ei[ρ] =

Gi(ρ, ∇ρ) dr,

vi(r) =

δEi[ρ]

=

∂Gi(ρ)
∂ρ(r)

−

dr

·

∂Gi(ρ)
∂∇ρ(r)

.

Using the identity (99), we can express the density functional as a one-particle density-matrix

functional:

Ei[ρ] = Ei[ρ1] =

δ(r1 − r2)Gi

ρ1(r2, r1), (∇1 + ∇2) ρ1(r2, r1)

dr1 dr2,

and its corresponding operator, denoted by ˆvi, is deﬁned by its kernel, given by

vi(r1, r2) =

given by

d

∂Gi(ρ1)
∂∇1ρ1(r2, r1)

=

(A11)

(cid:19)r2=r1

we obtain the following:

ˆviφ(r1) =

vi(r1, r2)φ(r2) dr2

δ(r1 − r2)

∂Gi(ρ1)
∂ρ1(r2, r1)

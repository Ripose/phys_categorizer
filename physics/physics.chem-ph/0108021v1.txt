Abstract. The correlation calculation of the electronic structure of PbH is
carried out with the Generalized Relativistic Eﬀective Core Potential (GRECP) and
MultiReference single- and Double-excitation Conﬁguration Interaction (MRD-CI)
methods. The 22-electron GRECP for Pb is used and the outer core 5s, 5p and
5d pseudospinors are frozen using the level-shift technique, so only ﬁve external
electrons of PbH are correlated. A new conﬁguration selection scheme with respect
to the relativistic multireference states is employed in the framework of the MRD-CI
method. The [6,4,3,2] correlation spin-orbit basis set is optimized in the coupled cluster
calculations on the Pb atom using a recently proposed procedure, in which functions
in the spin-orbital basis set are generated from calculations of diﬀerent ionic states of
the Pb atom and those functions are considered optimal which provide the stationary
point for some energy functional. Spectroscopic constants for the two lowest-lying
electronic states of PbH (2Π1/2,2 Π3/2) are found to be in good agreement with the
experimental data.

GRECP/MRD-CI calculation of PbH

1. Introduction

The Relativistic Eﬀective Core Potential (RECP) method has been widely used in recent
years in the correlation calculations of molecules with heavy and super-heavy atoms (see
e.g. [1]). This method allows one to treat explicitly only those electrons which play the
most important role in the making of chemical bonds, while interactions with the core
electrons and relativistic eﬀects are described with the help of some eﬀective one-electron
operator (usually semi-local) in the Hamiltonian. Depending on the desired or reachable
level of accuracy, one can choose an eﬀective Hamiltonian which provides the minimal
computational eﬀort for the given accuracy. Accordingly, the accuracy of the method
used for treating correlations and that of the RECP method should be consistent. From
that point of view, the PbH molecule is of considerable interest as a testing system.
In calculations on the Pb atom [2], a comparable level of accuracy for the Generalized
RECP (GRECP) and correlation calculation methods was observed. PbH is a weakly
bound system so the accuracy of the correlation calculation on the molecule can be
expected to be close to the accuracy of the correlation calculation on the Pb atom.

The GRECP method [3] developed in PNPI allows one to attain a level of accuracy
which is better than 200 cm−1 for transition energies in correlation calculations of
diﬀerent heavy atoms and their ions [2, 4]. Our recent calculations [5] also show that
the MRD-CI method with an improved selection scheme and properly chosen basis set
enables one to reach a level of accuracy for molecular calculations involving heavy atoms
which is comparable to the accuracy of the GRECP calculations for transition energies
between electronic terms in those atoms.

It can also be noted that from valence CI calculations and subsequent calculations
by the Relativistic Coupled Cluster method with Single and Double excitations (RCC-
SD) with the same number of the correlated electrons, one can easily calculate
contributions to the total energy from higher-order cluster amplitudes ﬁrst of all in order
to account for nondynamic correlation eﬀects in the valence region. That information
can be used in subsequent calculations by the RCC-SD method with an increased
number of correlated electrons to give a signiﬁcant improvement in the accuracy for
the description of correlation structure of the system of interest [2].

2. Methods

A detailed description of the methods used in the present calculations can be found
elsewhere [3, 5, 6]. Here we give only brief description and speciﬁcs of each method.

The GRECP operator contains non-local terms with the projectors on outer-
core pseudospinors, together with the radially-local terms common for other RECPs.
The addition of non-local terms is connected with a distinction between the eﬀective
potentials for outer-core and valence electrons.
It should be noted that one-electron
integral calculations with GRECPs are only slightly more time-consuming than with
ordinary radially-local RECPs, but this time is negligible in comparison with the time

needed for two-electron integral calculations.

In the MRD-CI method [6] only those Spin (and Space Symmetry) Adapted
Functions (SAFs) are included in the CI calculation which provide the values of the
second-order perturbation theory corrections to the energy

∆EI =

| < ΦI |H|Ψ0 > |2
EI − E0

which are greater than some threshold T0.
In the above equation, Ψ0 is some
multireference function and {ΦI} are the trial SAFs. As, in particular, was shown
in [5] for systems with large Spin-Orbit (SO) interaction, it is preferable to choose Ψ0 as
an eigenvector of some Hamiltonian including SO terms. The perturbation corrections
[6] for the T =0 threshold to the total state energies are applied after the ﬁnal SO-CI
calculations and Davidson corrections [7] are calculated for each term.

3. Basis set

To generate and optimize basis set for heavy atoms we mainly followed the procedure
described in detail in [2, 4]. The main features of that procedure are:

1. A number of the trial one-electron basis functions is generated in Dirac-Fock or
Hartree-Fock calculations of diﬀerent ionic states of the atom of interest with the
frozen core orbitals. In our case, two-component Hartree-Fock calculations with the
spin-averaged part of the GRECP (Averaged GRECP or AGREP) were carried out.
As a result, one-electron functions with the same n and l quantum numbers become
degenerate. Core orbitals are obtained from the AGREP/SCF calculations of the
Pb2+ ion (5s,p,d and 6s orbitals in the case of a 22-electron GRECP). Then SCF
calulations are performed with a diﬀerent number of electrons in the frozen-core
orbitals and an electron occupying some valence orbital (e.g. 6p).

2. The correlation calculation is performed with each generated function included
in the basis set. We carried out RCC-SD calculations of ﬁve lowest-lying
states of the Pb atom with the 6s2 6p2 leading conﬁguration (see [2] for more
computational details). In these calculations the j-dependent part of the GRECP
(Eﬀective Generalized Spin-Orbit Potential or EGSOP) is included in the eﬀective
Hamiltonian together with AGREP. Thus, eﬀects caused by the SO interaction are
taken into account on the basis set of many-electron spin-orbital functions. It is
clear that for the adequate description of the correlation eﬀects the number of stored
nonidentical two-electron integrals on the spin-orbital basis set is substantially
smaller than that on the spinor basis set. Therefore, calculations on the spin-orbital
basis sets can be more eﬃcient if correlation is more important than spin-orbit
interaction as it usually takes place for valence electrons.

3. The value of some energy functional is calculated using the correlation energies
obtained in the previous calculations. If the change of this functional (as compared
to the value of the functional obtained in the previous step) for some function

GRECP/MRD-CI calculation of PbH

is maximal in comparison with the cases of using other generated functions and
exceeds a given threshold, that function is added to the correlation basis set.
Otherwise, we neglect the function and the procedure starts from step 1 for an
orbital with other n and l quantum numbers.

4. Results

We have carried out three series of MRD-CI calculations for the four states going to
the two lowest dissociation limits of the PbH molecule. Five external electrons are
correlated and the 5s1/2, 5p1/2,3/2 and 5d3/2,5/2 pseudospinors are frozen from the two-
component GRECP/SCF calculation of the ground state of the Pb2+ ion (conﬁguration
6s2
1/2). At the ﬁrst run, a few of the lowest-energy conﬁguration functions in irreducible
representations of the nonrelativistic symmetry group were taken for each electronic term
at each point of the potential curves as the initial approximation for Ψ0 (i.e. reference
conﬁgurations). For the next two runs, those conﬁgurations are chosen as the reference
conﬁgurations which give the largest absolute values of CI coeﬃcients, CI, at the
previous run. The number of the reference conﬁgurations is selected using “CNFSORT”
code [8] such that their total contribution to the wavefunction (C 2
I ) is
approximately equal to 96% at the second run and to 98% at the third run for each of
the considered states and internuclear distances of the PbH molecule (for more details,
see paper by Mosyagin et al. from the same volume and paper [5]).

As “MRD-CI” program package only allows the use of symmetry group D2h and
lower orders, all calculations have been performed in the relativistic double group
symmetry C2v. Molecular spin-orbitals are obtained from SCF calculations performed
by program module “SCF” in “MOLCAS” package [10]. The correlation spin-orbital
basis set for Pb [6,4,3,2] generated in the way described above and basis set from [11]
reduced to [3,2,1] for H are used. We estimate Basis Set Superposition Error (BSSE) by
calculating the Pb atom in the molecular basis set, i.e. with “ghost” H atom at diﬀerent
distances. In our calculations the BSSE does not exceed 70 cm−1. The following formula
is used for the T =0 energy correction:

ET =0 ≃ ET =Tk − λ X

∆EI ,

∆EI <Tk

(2)

where ET =Tk and ET =0 are the total state energies calculated for the Tk and
zero thresholds, ∆EI is the energy lowering for the unselected SAFs estimated by
equation (1). The λ constant is determined from calculations with two diﬀerent
thresholds, T1 and T2:

ET =T1 − λ X

∆EI = ET =T2 − λ X

∆EI .

(3)

∆EI <T1

∆EI <T2

When applying the perturbation energy correction, the value of λ never exceeds 3
with the thresholds from 0.5µH to 0.03µH. Potential curves for the four lowest-lying
electronic states are presented on Figure 1. Molecular spectroscopic constants were

calculated by the Dunham method in the Born-Oppenheimer approximation using the
DUNHAM-SPECTR code [9].

Spectroscopic constants for the two lowest-lying molecular electronic terms are given
in Table 1. The next two electronic levels can not be characterized in the same way, as
can be seen from Figure 1.

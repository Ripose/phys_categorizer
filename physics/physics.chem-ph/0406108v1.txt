A model describing the relationship between the ortho–positronium lifetime and the volume of
a void, located in a synthetic zeolite, is analyzed. Our idea, which allows us to take into account
the eﬀects of temperature, comprises the introduction of a non–hermitian term in the Hamiltonian,
which accounts for the annihilation of the ortho–positronium. The predictions of the present model
are also confronted against an already known experimental result.

Key words: Positronium lifetime, polymers

I.

INTRODUCTION

In the context of polymer research one of the most
interesting issues is connected with the relationship be-
tween molecular relaxation and free–volume properties
[1]. Experimentally several techniques have been already
developed in order to determine the size of these voids
in polymers, for instance, small–angle X ray diﬀraction
[2], neutron diﬀraction [3], or positron annihilation spec-
troscopy [4], in which the positron or positronium play
the role of a probe, and the lifetimes of these systems are
monitored.

The current experimental results give evidence that
the positron and positronium are localized in the pre–
existing free–volumes in polymers [5], and in consequence
one could relate the size of the free–volume region with
the detected lifetime [6].

The use of positron or positronium lifetimes to deter-
mine the size of voids faces severe diﬃculties [1], which
leave only the possibility of employing approximated a-
pproaches to determine the correlation between lifetime
and free–volume. Clearly this is an indirect method, and
in consequence we need a model to link the measured pa-
rameter with the required variable. Usually this require-
ment has been satisﬁed employing the so called standard
model [7]. Nevertheless it must be underlined that, as al-
ready noted [7], this model embraces several deﬁciencies.
In the present work it will be assumed that the positro-
nium is located in a spherical wall, but, in order to avoid
one of the existing drawbacks (to wit, that the matrix
electrons form a layer of homogeneous density and thick-
ness), we will not only consider a ﬁnite wall, but also we
will introduce a non–hermitian term in the Hamiltonian,
which accounts then for the annihilation of the positro-
nium due to its interaction with the polymer. In this way
the atomic structure of the polymer is taken into account
in a more realistic manner, though, of course, the descrip-
tion of this interaction can be improved. Additionally we

may consider not only the ground state of the particle (as
happens in the standard model), but also excited states,
in other words, our model does not necessarily imply a
low temperature.

Our ﬁnal result will be the radius of the void in the
form of a polynomial, in which the coeﬃcients will be
related to variables that could be detected in an expe-
riment, see (9) below, where the radius of the void, R,
does deﬁne indeed a polynomial, in which the coeﬃcients
are functions of parameters that are under control in an
experiment, for instance, τ (lifetime), m (mass of the
particle), etc.

II. NON–HERMITIAN POTENTIALS

As usual in the standard model, we treat the ortho–
positronium as a single particle, and refer its wave func-
tion with respect to its center of mass. As mentioned
above, we analyze the relationship between the ortho–
positronium lifetime and a spherical free–volume region
with the introduction of a non–hermitian term in the po-
tential associated with the barrier. Hence we have that
the potential to consider reads

V (r) = 0, r < R,

V (r) = V0 + iγ, r ≥ R.

(1)

(2)

Here γ ≤ 0 and V0 ≥ 0. Comparing with the stan-
dard model [7] we may see that in our case we do not
assume a certain thickness ∆R associated with the layer
deﬁned by the matrix electrons. At this point it is note-
worthy to mention that this assumption of the standard
model is used also to calculate the wave function in such
a way that the corresponding Schr¨odinger equation has
the same form inside the hole and in the region inside the

polymer deﬁned by R ≤ r ≤ R + ∆R [7], a questionable
fact, since this requirement neglects the potential in the
aforementioned region. Our approach does not need this
kind of approximation.

We may fathom deeper the introduction of the imagi-
nary term in the potential noting that in the standard
[1]) a homogeneous electron
model (see, for instance,
layer with a thickness ∆R must be introduced.
Inside
this layer takes place the annihilation process, in other
words, it is a relevant parameter of the model. Clearly,
∆R is an empirical variable, and though in the present
model we have, at this level, also an empirical parame-
ter, namely, γ, there are some important diﬀerences be-
tween the two aforementioned approaches that must be
underlined. Indeed, for instance, in the standard model
(see ﬁgure 1 of [1]) the wave function of the positronium
(which is, strictly, valid only inside the hole) is extrap-
olated to the electron layer.
It is readily seen that in
this case the distortion of the wave function due to the
presence of the layer is not taken into account. In addi-
tion, since quantization emerges from the introduction of
boundary conditions, it is also clear that the thickness of
the layer, in the standard model, does not impinge upon
the quantization of some of the variables of the positro-
nium, i.e., the energy.

In our proposal the rate of annihilation is considered
as an empirical parameter, γ, (this statement can be un-
derstood better remembering that in the probability con-
servation equation γ plays the role of a sink, see (6) be-
low), and hence we do not need to extrapolate the wave
function to any region not contained in the hole (there-
fore we do not change the quantization of the energy, for
instance). In other words, we reduce, compared to the
standard model, the number of assumptions.

Additionally, the condition of an inﬁnite potential ba-
rrier is not imposed, as is usual in some previous a-
pproaches [1, 7]. The presence of the matrix of electrons
is considered with introduction of the extra term, the
non–hermitian contribution in the potential energy, and
it will play the role of a sink for our particles.

Performing the usual procedure we have that the radial
part of the wave function has two diﬀerent expressions in
terms of spherical Bessel functions

yl(r) = Ajl(ρ), r < R,

yl(r) = Bjl(˜ρ) + Cηl(˜ρ), r ≥ R.

Here we have that ρ =

2mEl

~2 r, and ˜ρ =

2m(El−V0−iγ)
~2

r.

q

Quantization of energy appears when we consider the
q
continuity conditions upon these two expressions, and
also upon their logarithmic derivatives on the surface r =
R. Clearly, it is possible to consider the case in which the
involved particle is in an excited state (l 6= 0). In other

(3)

words, this approach allows us to consider the possibility
of taking into account, at least partially, the eﬀects of
temperature.

If l = 0, then the energy reads (approximately)

E0 = V0 +

~4Ω2
4m2R4

r

− γ2.

The parameter Ω, a consequence of the continuity con-
ditions, is equal to 5.15. Clearly we may express the mi-
croscopic parameter γ as a function of E0, R, and V0.

III. ORTHO–POSITRONIUM LIFETIME AND
FREE–VOLUME RADIUS

At this point a link between lifetime and the solutions
to the Schr¨odinger is needed, here we assume that the
measured lifetime comprises two diﬀerent terms:

1) The time that a particle, with energy E0 and mass
m, needs to travel a distance equal to the radius of the
free–volume region.

2) The decay time of an ortho–positronium located in-

side the polymer.

Concerning these two contributions to the lifetime it
has to be mentioned that in the ﬁrst part we have a
semiclassical approach, which means that several condi-
tions have to be fulﬁlled in order to obtain a good a-
pproximation, for instance, the de Broglie wavelength of
the particle, λc = ~
p , has to be smaller than the radius,
i.e., λc < R.

The second part of the present model considers the
fact that the annihilation process takes place inside the
polymer at a distance from the surface r = R, which is
negligible compared with R.

If we consider the continuity equation at any point

inside the polymer we ﬁnd that

Here ˆρ denotes the probability density associated with
the ortho–positronium and J the corresponding proba-
bility current. At a ﬁxed point inside the material we
have that

ˆρ = exp (

(6)

(7)

This last expression (f (~r) is a function of the posi-
tion) clearly shows that γ is related to the decay of the
ortho–positronium when it is not in the void, and in con-
sequence we may link it with second part of our assump-
tion. In this way we ﬁnd that it renders a contribution
to the lifetime that goes (approximately) like τ2 = − ~
2γ .

Hence the lifetime is given by

At this point it is noteworthy to comment that we
have assumed, from square one, that the positronium is
always localized inside the void. In other words, we do
not consider a modiﬁcation of a situation in which the
positronium may escape from the hole, a case already
studied [10].

It is readily seen that a theoretical prediction requires
a deeper knowledge of the electron layer, to wit, the value
of V0. It is also clear that the evaluation of this parameter
lies outside the realm of the present approach. Neverthe-
less, in order to have an idea of the possibilities of the
present model let us now assume that V0 has an order
of magnitude similar to the contribution of one atom to
the internal energy of a solid (within the Einstein model
[? ]) in the limit in which the temperature of the solid
is much higher than the characteristic Einstein tempera-
ture. Therefore

V0 = κT.

(13)

The introduction now of T ∼ 300K, in the case of the
lifetime of an α–cage, of the so–called MS–4A zeolite [8],
the one reads τ ∼ 5.9ns, renders

It is readily seen that in our last expression, if we seek
to obtain information concerning the size of the void,
then we must know the terms which are available in an
experiment. In some cases [9] the annihilation rate inside
the electron layer is an experimental result, in our case
this means that we may know the value of γ. Bearing
this in mind we may cast (5) and (8) as a polynomial
equation for the radius

The experimental value for this case reads [8]

R = 0.42nm.

R = 0.57nm.

In other words, our model provides a radius that has
the same order of magnitude than the experimental mea-
surement.

This last expression embodies the main result in the
present work. In order to resort to (9) as a model link-
ing the lifetime and void size we require, in addition, the
value of γ and V0. As previously mentioned, in some ma-
terials the annihilation rate inside the electron layer is
known. Forsooth, in the case of positronium the annihi-
lation rate inside the electron layer is the spin–averaged

V. CONCLUSIONS

The case of an ortho–positronium immersed in a sphe-
rically symmetric potential wall, in which the potential
barrier contains a non–hermitian term, has been consi-
dered as a model to obtain a correlation between lifetime
and free–volume regions in some polymers.

This approach allows us to take into account the eﬀects
of temperature, i.e., we may consider in expressions (3)
and (4) the case l 6= 0, a fact that implies that the particle
is not in its ground state. Indeed, let us now suppose that

In the standard model this energy diﬀerence [8] reads
∆E = 3 ~2
mR2 , in other words, our prediction is 13/3 times
larger than the one stemming from the standard model.
Clearly, one of the mayor objections to the standard
model, spherical symmetry, is here also present, and, as
it has already been pointed out [7], even ellipsoidal sy-
mmetry is unlikely to represent the real situation. Ne-
vertheless, the simple case that we have considered here
allows us to obtain analytical results (we do not have
to resort to molecular dynamics simulations in order to
improve the standard model [7]).

Additionally we avoid a second drawback of the stan-
dard model, closely related to the presence of a layer
of homogeneous density, and thickness ∆R, deﬁned by
the matrix electrons.
Indeed, the introduction of this
layer entails also an additional condition, to wit, the wave
function inside the layer is taken from the solution that

emerges inside the spherical hole [1, 7], a situation that
can not be correct. In our case, we do not need introduce
this assumption.

The eﬀects of the polymer are taken into account
with the introduction of γ, a microscopic parameter that
can be straightforwardly connected with an experimen-
tal output [9], and with V0. Resorting to a very rough
assumption, expression (13), has rendered an order of
magnitude for the radius of the void that matches with
the experimental readout. Of course, a more precise pre-
diction demands a more physical value for V0 (than the
one here employed), nevertheless (14) and (15) show that
the present model could be a useful one.

To conclude, it is already a known result [12] that the
holes show a signiﬁcant asphericity. Hence, a further case
in the context of the present work is related to the po-
ssibility of improving the standard model trying to gene-
ralize the present approach to situations lacking spherical
symmetry, for instance, considering ﬁrst ellipsoids, as in
[1], and introducing non–hermitian terms in the potential
energy. Though, as [1] clearly shows, we must resort to
numerical methods.

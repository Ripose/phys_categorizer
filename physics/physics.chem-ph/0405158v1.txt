A new density functional theory (DFT) exchange-correlation functional for the exploration of

reaction mechanisms is proposed. This new functional, denoted BMK (Boese-Martin for Kinetics),

has an accuracy in the 2 kcal/mol range for transition state barriers but, unlike previous attempts

at such a functional, this improved accuracy does not come at the expense of equilibrium properties.

This makes it a general-purpose functional whose domain of applicability has been extended to

transition states, rather than a specialized functional for kinetics. The improvement in BMK rests

on the inclusion of the kinetic energy density together with a large value of the exact exchange

mixing coeﬃcient. For this functional, the kinetic energy density appears to correct ‘back’ the

excess exact exchange mixing for ground-state properties, possibly simulating variable exchange.

I.

INTRODUCTION

In the last decade, density functional theory (DFT) has probably become the number

one applied computational chemistry tool. Most exchange-correlation functionals currently

used[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] — including the exceedingly popular Becke 3-parameter-Lee-Yang-Parr

(B3LYP) hybrid functional [6, 7] — have been developed more than ten years ago. Yet these

ﬁrst-generation functionals exhibit a number of chemically important weaknesses.

A number of second-generation functionals have been proposed as successors in recent

years, such as PBE (Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof[8]), mPW91 (modiﬁed Perdew-Wang 1991[9]),

VSXC (Van Voorhis-Scuseria exchange-correlation[10]), PBE0 (PBE with 25% exact ex-

change added[11]), PKZB (Perdew-Kurth-Zupan-Blaha[12]), B97 (Becke 1997[13]), B97-1

(Becke 1997 variant 1[14]), B97-2 (Becke 1997 variant 2[19]), the HCTH (Hamprecht-Cohen-

Tozer-Handy) family[14, 15, 16], OPTX/OPTC (optimized exchange/correlation[17, 18]),

τ -HCTH and its hybrid[20], TPSS (Tao-Perdew-Staroverov-Scuseria[21]), and B98 (Becke

1998 [22]). Two important avenues that have been pursued in this direction are: (a) inclu-

sion of new variables explicitly dependent on the Kohn-Sham orbitals, such as the kinetic

energy density τ ; (b) treatment of DFT as a parametrized ‘semi-ab initio’ method[23].

In particular, the most commonly used hybrid functionals all involve parametrization

against experimental data to some extent: For instance, the mixing parameters in B3LYP

were ﬁtted against the binding energies of the molecules in the G2-1 set[24]. Becke’s subse-

quent 1997 functional[13] involves a power series expansion in the reduced density gradient,

parameters of which were ﬁtted against the binding energies, ionization potentials, and pro-

ton aﬃnities in the G2-1 set plus some additional data. An expansion of order m requires

3m + 4 parameters:

for m = 4 and higher the ﬁt became unphysical, and even m = 3

appeared to exhibit signs of over-ﬁtting. Erring on the side of caution, Becke chose m = 2,

involving 10 parameters.

The issue of over-ﬁtting may be substantially alleviated by (a) admitting high-level ab ini-

tio data to the ‘training set’; (b) considering data other than energetics, such as gradients at

the equilibrium geometry (a convenient metric for geometry errors) and numerical exchange-

correlation potentials extracted from high-level ab initio electron densities by means of the

Zhao-Morrison-Parr[25] procedure. Tozer and Handy[26, 27, 28] followed this route, with

only moderate success, as their functional form was ‘poorly chosen’[28]. Greater success

2

was achieved by applying this more elaborate reﬁnement procedure to Becke’s functional

form, yielding the original HCTH/93 (Hamprecht-Cohen-Tozer-Handy[14, 29]) functional.

Besides this m = 4 ‘pure DFT’ functional, a reparametrization of Becke’s hybrid functional

(denoted B97-1) was obtained as a by-product.

The general performance of HCTH/93 was markedly superior to ﬁrst-generation GGA

(generalized gradient approximation) functionals such as BLYP (Becke-Lee-Yang-Parr[3, 6]).

However, it did not measure up to expectations for weakly bound systems[30, 31]; in general,

the absence of anions in the training set meant that the functional was not adequately

parametrized for the outer regions of the electron density. In an attempt to remedy this

problem and generally increase the versatility of the functional, it was reparametrized[15, 16]

to ever larger sets of data including anions and weakly bound systems, culminating in the

HCTH/407 functional[16]. The numerals in the notation refer to the number of chemical

systems used in the training set.

Attempts to include additional variables such as the kinetic energy density τ into the

functional have been reviewed in the introduction to Ref.[20]. This latter paper represents

an attempt to enhance HCTH with τ -dependent terms. One intriguing question here is the

actual role played by the kinetic energy density. Becke has argued[32] that local density func-

tionals that include the kinetic energy density τ can simulate delocalized exchange and thus,

inclusion of τ will improve generalized gradient functionals. Van Voorhis and Scuseria[10]

presented evidence that such a form might be capable of simulating exact exchange. Boese

and Handy[20] have similar experience, but conjectured that τ does not merely simulate

exact exchange, but rather variable exact exchange[20].

This brings us to the subject of this paper. One well-known deﬁciency (see e.g.[33,

34]) of most existing exchange-correlation functionals is their poor performance for reaction

barrier heights: These are often signiﬁcantly underestimated, and it is indeed not unusual

for DFT not to ﬁnd a barrier at all. Durant[33] noted that BH&HLYP (Becke half-and-

half exchange with LYP correlation[35]), a hybrid functional with 50% exact exchange,

was the exception to the rule in that it predicted transition state geometries and barriers

reasonably well, despite being inferior to B3LYP (20% exact exchange) for thermochemical

properties. Later, Truhlar and coworkers[36] and Kang and Musgrave[37] both proposed

reparametrizations of existing functionals (modiﬁed Perdew-Wang[9] in the former, B3LYP

without Becke exchange in the latter case) for barrier heights: both functionals involve

3

a very high fraction of exact exchange, 42.7% in the case of mPW1K (modiﬁed Perdew-

Wang for kinetics[36]), 55.7% in the case of KMLYP (Kang-Musgrave-Lee-Yang-Parr[37]).

For both functionals, the improved performance for reaction barrier heights comes at the

expense of seriously degraded performance for ground-state properties: in particular, errors

in atomization energies and geometries exceed those for more conventional hybrid functionals

with exact exchange in the 15–25% range by a factor of two to three[38]. In the case of

KMLYP, an empirical G2-style ‘high level correction’ was proposed, but this is strictly a

stop-gap solution as it will not aﬀect properties other than equilibrium energetics.

For researchers involved in the computational study of reaction mechanisms (such as our

own group, see e.g.[39, 40]) the present situation is very frustrating — especially when a

plethora of competing multi-step pathways is to be considered[39] — as no single functional

can be relied upon to get both relative stabilities and barrier heights right.

One possible route to such a functional might be variable exact exchange. If the kinetic

energy density were truly capable of simulating variable exact exchange, however, then a

ﬁxed-exact exchange functional with τ -dependent terms might aﬀord a computationally

much simpler solution. In the present paper, we will show that this is indeed the case, and

shall propose a new general-purpose exchange-correlation functional to be known as BMK

(Boese-Martin for kinetics).

Before discussing the development of the new functional, however, we would like to men-

tion a couple of alternative approaches to tackling the aforementioned problem of transition

states. These are connected to attempts by various groups at creating ‘third-generation

functionals’. None of these functionals are currently accurate enough to replace any of the

second-generation functionals.

Self-interaction-free or -corrected functionals constitute the ﬁrst possibility. Here, an ad-

ditional orbital-dependent correction is introduced[41], causing the energy to lose invariance

to rotations of occupied orbitals. Solving these equations self-consistently is both time-

consuming and diﬃcult[42]. Furthermore, no gradients or higher derivatives with respect to

the geometry are available, which greatly reduces their usefulness in practical applications.

The second novel approach is to use functionals with so-called local exact exchange. How-

ever, such functionals either perform much less well when describing ground-state properties

than the known functionals[43], or have various diﬃculties describing spin splittings[44].

II. COMPUTATIONAL DETAILS

In order to obtain additional reference data beyond those in the HCTH/407 data set[16],

the W1 and W2 (Weizmann-1 and -2) computational thermochemistry protocols[45, 46] were

applied. Basically these methods represent approximations to the CCSD(T) inﬁnite basis

set limit: They generate average errors for total atomization energies (TAEs) in the kJ/mol

range, and should therefore deﬁnitely be accurate enough for our purpose. The calculations

were carried out by means of the MOLPRO2002 electronic structure package[47] and a driver

script written in Perl[48].

The parametrization of the functional itself was carried out using a collection of ad hoc

programs and scripts written by one of us (ADB): modiﬁed versions of both CADPAC[49]

and Gaussian 03[50] were used as DFT engines.

Both are ﬁnite basis set DFT codes. The HCTH family of functionals was parametrized

using a triple-zeta plus double polarization (TZ2P) basis set. We discovered early on in

the present study that this basis set is insuﬃciently saturated for our purposes: we indeed

found that in the case of the HCTH and τ -HCTH functionals, some basis set superposition

error has been absorbed into the functional. On the dependence of DFT parametrization

on the basis set used, see Ref.[38]. After some convergence studies, we decided on the

following combination of basis sets: Jensen aug-pc2 (augmented polarization consistent-2)

basis set[51] for {H,C,N,O,F}, TZ3Pf+diﬀuse (triple-zeta plus triple polarization plus dif-

fuse, including an additional high-exponent d function as known to be required for many

second-row compounds[52]) for {B, Al, Si, P, S, Cl}, the Wachters-Hay basis set[53] for

ﬁrst-row transition metals augmented with 2f 1g polarization functions taken from the Ap-

pendix to Ref.[54], the SDB-aug-cc-pVTZ basis set[54] for third- and fourth-row main group

elements, and the 6-311+G(3df) basis set[55] for remaining elements. We are conﬁdent that

this combination of basis sets is suﬃciently close to the Kohn-Sham basis set limit for our

purposes.

III. TOWARDS A NEW FUNCTIONAL

We shall try to develop a functional with the following design goals:

• Mean absolute error below 2 kcal/mol for reaction barrier heights;

5

• Smallest mean absolute error possible for atomization energies, geometry and harmonic

frequencies of ground-state molecules;

• No separation between exchange and correlation functionals, in light of error cancel-

lation between the two terms;

• A mathematically ‘simple’ functional in order to facilitate insight;

• A power series expansion, yielding the maximum number of adjustable parameters

(usually on the order of 10-20);

• A functional that obeys some of the more simple scaling conditions and furthermore

is capable of modeling the exchange hole[22, 56];

• As diverse and balanced a parametrization set as possible, including transition metal

(TM) complexes and hydrogen-bonded systems.

We will consider two diﬀerent functional forms, one the hybrid HCTH[14] form (of which

B97[13] and B97-1[14] are special cases), the other the hybrid τ -HCTH form. The exchange-

correlation energy (with a as the mixing coeﬃcient) is deﬁned as:

and the kinetic energy density τ is deﬁned as:

For the B97 form, EX,n−l will be zero. The B97-1 functional[14] has 12 linear coeﬃcients with

the sum over M in equations 3, 11, and 13 going to M=2. The τ -HCTH hybrid functional[20]

had 16 linear coeﬃcients with the sum over M in equations 3, 7, 11, and 13 going to M=3.

In both cases, the sum was truncated when no appreciable further improvement was seen

from the inclusion of higher-order terms. The main improvement in the τ -HCTH hybrid

functional obviously came from the higher order terms which included the kinetic energy

density.

In a ﬁrst ‘numerical experiment’, we varied the amount of Hartree-Fock exchange (the

variable a in equation 1) in each of these functionals in small increments between 0 and

50 %, and ‘self-consistently’ re-reﬁned all other parameters to the HCTH/147 dataset[16]

which is similar to the G2-2 dataset of Pople and coworkers[24, 57, 58]. The RMS errors

7

for both ‘meta-functionals’, as a function of the percentage of Hartree-Fock exchange, are

plotted in Figure 1.

We can make the following observations. First of all, both curves exhibit minima in the

20% range, consistent with experience. Second, the improvement aﬀorded by the kinetic

energy density terms is not nearly as large as one might have expected. Third, the main

diﬀerence occurs far away from the minimum: the ‘meta-functional’ including τ deteriorates

much less rapidly than the one without, both as exact exchange is reduced to zero and as it

is cranked up into the 50% region.

It may be instructive to consider the evolution of the parameters — particularly the

zeroth-order linear coeﬃcients of equations 3–14 which contribute most to the energy — as

a function of ‘exact exchange’ admixture. All these coeﬃcients, save the second non-local

one, will be unity for the uniform electron gas. For the B97-like form, the zeroth-order

exchange-coeﬃcient cXσ,l,0 varies from 1.1 (at 0% HF exchange) to about 0.4 (at 50% HF

exchange). For the τ -HCTH-like form, at 50% exact exchange mixing, this coeﬃcient stands

at 0.5, or 1.2 higher than without the terms including the kinetic energy density. As we would

have expected, the cXσ,n−l,0 coeﬃcient changes from near-zero (0.001) at 0% HF exchange

to -0.38 at 50% HF exchange. Hence, the terms including the kinetic energy become much

larger, apparently ‘correcting back’ the exact exchange mixing. Furthermore, the zeroth-

order correlation coeﬃcients are aﬀected a lot by adding exact exchange: For example,

cCσσ,0 actually becomes negative. For the B97 form, these coeﬃcients change from 0.4 to

-2.8. The τ -HCTH form, however, behaves completely diﬀerently, with cXσσ,0 remaining

around 0.4. For the B97 form, this eﬀect is cancelled by the cXαβ,0 coeﬃcient, going from

0.5 to 1.8. Again, the τ -HCTH form functionals coeﬃcient does barely change from 0.7

to 0.9. As a conclusion, we note that the terms depending on the kinetic energy density

have to be responsible for the relatively shallow ‘τ -including’ curve in Figure 1. Moreover,

changes in the coeﬃcients are by and large limited to the exchange part, while for the τ -free

(B97) form, both exchange and correlation coeﬃcients are quite sensitive to variation in the

amount of Hartree-Fock exchange. Thus, in short, introduction of Equations 4 and 5 into

the functional makes it capable of correcting back for excess exact exchange.

This immediately begs the question whether this property of the τ -HCTH hybrid form

also applies to reaction barrier heights and transition state geometries. Furthermore, what

would be the behavior of the various terms and parameters as a function of the percentage

8

of Hartree-Fock exchange?

For this purpose, we included such transition states into our ‘training’ or ‘ﬁtting’ set. At

this stage, we employed the set of reactions proposed by Truhlar and coworkers[59] for which

accurate experimentally derived barrier heights (including tunneling and other quantum

corrections) are available. To this we added two identity SN 2 reactions for which accurate

barriers were previous determined by W2 theory[60]. For Truhlar’s reactions, we performed

W1 and W2 reference calculations at the QCISD/MG3 geometries given in the Supporting

Information to Ref.[59]. Results are summarized in Table I. Overall, the agreement between

theory and the values derived from experiment is quite good: any discrepancies would be

primarily due to post-CCSD(T) correlation eﬀects, or uncertainty in the measurements or

quantum corrections. The transition states of the reactions H2 + F and OH + Cl exhibit

severe nondynamical correlation, and CCSD(T) data would not be very meaningful. In the

case of the H2 + F reaction, we prefer to use the barrier of 2.31 kcal/mol obtained by K´allay

et al.[61] in the set, and in the case of the OH + Cl reaction, we ended up employing the

experimental value of 9.8 kcal/mol. Altogether 44 barriers (22 forward and 22 reverse) are

reported in Table I, although obviously, a method that would get both the forward barrier

and the reaction energy right would automatically give the right answer for the reverse

barrier — so either the reverse barrier height or the reaction energy would be redundant

data. For determining the functional, we included these 22 forward reaction barrier heights

plus the reaction barriers of Cl + CH3Cl → Cl + CH3Cl and F + CH3F → F + CH3F.

Since only some of the molecules in Table I were included in the HCTH/147 set, we only

use 14 of the 19 reaction energies in the small set. These were augmented with nine reaction

energies[62] that were used by Sch¨utz et al. to assess local correlation methods[63].

If we were to exclusively consider errors in atomization energies, it is at least in principle

possible that just a particular type of bond is poorly described, and the error statistics

obtained are not representative for reactions involving formation and/or breaking of other

bond types. Adding reaction energies to the training set at least allows us to verify that the

various molecules involved at least yield correct energetics relative to their molecular ‘next

of kin’. Furthermore, typical DFT studies are probably more likely to focus on reaction

energies than on atomization energies.

The original HCTH/147 set[15] was thus enlarged by 22 reaction barrier heights, 23 reac-

tion energies, the dissociation energy of the NH3 and (H2O)(NH3) dimers, and some potential

9

energy points of the NH3 dimer surface[64]. The latter two properties were given low weights,

while the reaction energies were assigned ten times the weight for the atomization energies,

thus taking into account that said reaction energies are an order of magnitude smaller than

typical atomization energies multiplied by the molecularity (number of molecules involved)

of the reaction.

Once again, all parameters were ‘self-consistently’ reﬁtted for every value of the exact

exchange coeﬃcient, and this analysis was repeated for various relative weights assigned to

the barrier heights in the ‘penalty function’. For the τ -free form, proﬁles of the RMS errors

for all energetics other than barrier heights are plotted in Figure 2 (every curve representing a

diﬀerent weight factor for the barrier heights), while the corresponding proﬁles for the barrier

heights themselves can be found in Figure 3. With a zero weight for the transition states,

the expected single minimum around 20% Hartree-Fock exchange is obtained. However, as

soon as the barriers are even given a unit weight, a second minimum appears around 40%.

As the weight for the transition states is increased, both minima persist at least through

WTS = 50. Note that the curves are not perfectly smooth since the ﬁnal parameters are

somewhat dependent on the initial parametrization chosen.

For a functional to be useful for transition states, barriers have to be predicted quite

accurately — especially for reactions with low barriers which might otherwise be spuriously

rendered barrierless. A 2 kcal/mol RMS target accuracy would, according to Figure 3,

require WTS = 50. Using this relative weight, we have plotted RMS error proﬁles for both

barrier heights and other energetic properties as a function of the percentage of Hartree-Fock

exchange in Figure 4, for both the τ -free and the τ -including forms. Parameter optimizations

for the latter took the ﬁnal parameters for the former as initial guesses.

Note that the minimum around 20% for the non-barrier height energetics is now very

shallow, and that both functional forms exhibit a deeper second minimum around 40%. For

the barrier heights, there only appears to be a single minimum, at 42% to be precise[65].

This value was retained for the ﬁnal functionals.

The B97-1 like τ -less form was frozen at this stage, and will henceforth be denoted B97-K

(Becke-97 for ‘kinetics’).

The τ -dependent form was then subjected to its ﬁnal reﬁnement. On the one hand, we

expanded the ‘training set’ to an enlarged version of the HCTH/407 set[16], encompassing

464 energetic properties and 4008 Cartesian gradient components. This set includes nearly

10

the full G3-99 set of molecules[66] minus some very large organic systems, plus several dis-

sociation energies of hydrogen-bonded complexes and stationary points on the ammonia

dimer potential surface taken from Ref.[64], and several ligand dissociation energies of tran-

sition metal complexes — in addition to the reaction barriers heights already discussed. On

the other hand, we replaced TZ2P by the large basis set described in the Computational

Methods section. Full details of all the data are available in the Supplementary Material[67].

The ﬁnal functional thus obtained is denoted BMK (from the present authors’ initials and

the K of ‘kinetics’). The parameters of both B97-K and BMK are given in Table II. Some

of their values are somewhat surprising if we consider the coeﬃcients of these functionals

when no barrier heights are included, as discussed above. We will ﬁrst discuss the GGA

(B97) functional form. With a larger fraction of exact exchange, the zero-order correlation

coeﬃcients cCσσ,0 and cCαβ,0 will ‘try to correct back’ the large amount of exchange mixing,

together with a smaller local exchange coeﬃcient cXσ,local,0. Introducing transition states into

the ﬁt to obtain B97-K will reverse this eﬀect, since this large amount of exact exchange is

needed.

The τ -HCTH form, however, behaves the opposite way. Here, with a larger fraction of

exact exchange, the non-local exchange coeﬃcients can now ‘correct back’ the exchange,

yielding positive correlation coeﬃcients cCσσ,0 and cCαβ,0.

When introducing the transition states into the set to obtain BMK, these non-local

coeﬃcients are now needed for something else, and the zero-order correlation and exchange

coeﬃcients look similar to the B97 functional with a larger fraction of exact exchange.

While having a small eﬀect on the other coeﬃcients at the minimum in Figure 1 (see Table

II of reference [20] for comparison), the kinetic energy density has a very large eﬀect as

soon as the amount of exact exchange is not around 15-25%. This explains the previously

reported observation that functionals employing the kinetic energy density are capable of

simulating exact exchange.

It also implies that with large values of the exact exchange

mixing coeﬃcient, the beneﬁts derived from incorporating the kinetic energy density and

similar variables into DFT functionals will be even larger.

We shall now ﬁnally assess the new functionals for a variety of properties, in particular

as to how they measure up compared to other functionals designed either speciﬁcally for

barrier heights or for equilibrium energetics.

IV. ASSESSMENT OF DENSITY FUNCTIONALS

As our ﬁnal parametrization set of 464 systems is larger and arguably more diverse

than any previously used, we shall use it for comparison with other functionals as well.

We have considered (a) the GGA functionals BP86 (Becke exchange[3] with Perdew 1986

correlation[4]), BLYP[3, 6], HCTH/407[16], and PBE (Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof[8]); (b) the

meta-GGA functionals τ -HCTH[20] and VSXC[10]; (c) the hybrid functionals B3LYP[6,

7], B97-1[14], B97-2[68], PBE0[8, 11], τ -HCTH hybrid[20], KMLYP[37] and mPW1K[36].

We employed the same large spdf basis set for the assessment as was used for the ﬁnal

parametrization cycles of BMK. Summary error statistics for all functionals, broken down

by type of molecule or property, are presented in Table III.

For the non-hybrid functionals, the results of the previous investigations with the TZ2P

and cc-pVTZ basis sets[38] are corroborated: For all molecules, the τ -HCTH functional

yields the lowest errors, followed by the HCTH/407 and VSXC functionals. Particularly

BP86 and PBE yield very large errors when considering geometries and atomization energies.

Interestingly, this pattern is not necessarily carried over from the TAEs to the reaction

energies:

for instance, VSXC has half the RMS error for atomization energies of BLYP

but both functionals perform similarly (somewhat poorly) for reaction energies. As to the

geometry gradient errors which correlate with geometry errors, see also Refs.[16, 20], the

best performance appears to be put in by those functionals that perform best for TAEs (i.e.

the meta-GGAs and HCTH/407).

HCTH/407 and both meta-GGA functionals in fact are overall competitive with the

very popular B3LYP hybrid functional, in turn surpassed by B97-1 and B97-2. Interestingly

(although perhaps fortuitously), all hybrid functionals perform worse than the (meta-)GGAs

for transition metal ligation energies, although this problem is greatly mitigated in τ -HCTH

hybrid. For our dataset, the best hybrid functionals (B97-1 and B97-2) overall represent an

improvement over (meta-)GGAs for TAEs, but not signiﬁcantly so for ionization potentials

and electron aﬃnities. As expected, the transition-state optimized mPW1K and KMLYP

functionals perform rather poorly for the thermochemical properties, although this would

be mitigated somewhat in the case of KMLYP by applying their recommended ‘high-level’

additive correction. For geometric parameters, the RMS error of mPW1K is twice, and that

of KMLYP thrice, that of other functionals.

Interestingly, mPW1K performs reasonably

12

well for the reaction energies.

Our B97-K functional fares better than mPW1K, with errors for equilibrium energetics

generally in between mPW1K and B97-1, and errors for geometries comparable to B3LYP or

τ -HCTH hybrid (cut in half compared to mPW1K). But it is for BMK that performance is

particularly pleasing: its performance for most energetic properties is comparable to the best

hybrid general-purpose functionals, despite its high percentage of Hartree-Fock exchange.

Indeed, for transition metal complexes it has the second best performance of all hybrid

functionals, after τ -HCTH hybrid. For geometries, its RMS error is somewhat deteriorated

compared to B97-1 or to its closest kin, τ -HCTH hybrid, but still much less so than that of

mPW1K or KMLYP. The performance of BMK for TAEs of neutral molecules is especially

pleasing. Error statistics for ionization potentials and electron aﬃnities are comparable

to B3LYP. Overall, BMK can hold its own with general-purpose hybrid functionals for

equilibrium energetics and geometries.

Interestingly, the improvements previously reported[20] for the τ -HCTH hybrid functional

compared to B97-1 now vanish because of the larger basis set (compared to TZ2P used in

the earlier work). This suggests again that some basis set incompleteness error may have

been absorbed in the parametrization of the HCTH family[69].

For reaction barrier heights, the general-purpose hybrid functionals represent an improve-

ment over all (meta-)GGAs except perhaps τ -HCTH. Yet they are clearly trumped by the

transition state-optimized functionals, three of which (mPW1K, B97-K, and BMK) have

errors around 2 kcal/mol.

Histograms of the errors for the BMK and B97-K functional, as well as for B3LYP

and mPW1K, are given in Figures S–1 through S–4 in the Electronic Supplement to this

paper[70]. The error distributions can be ﬁtted rather well (correlation coeﬃcients R ranging

from 0.98 for B97-K to 0.993 for BMK) by a normal distribution A exp(−(x−µ)2/2σ2), which

has been displayed in each graph together with its mean µ and standard deviation σ. We

can see that we did not merely remedy an additive bias (with µ shifting from -4.1 kcal/mol

for mPW1K to -0.6 kcal/mol for BMK), but that the error distribution was narrowed by a

factor of two (from σ=6.7 kcal/mol for mPW1K to 3.3 kcal/mol for BMK), and that BMK

indeed compares favorably to B3LYP (µ=-1.4, σ=4.3 kcal/mol) in both regards. In contrast,

B97-K only represents a minor improvement (µ=-3.9, σ=6.4 kcal/mol) over mPW1K.

Overall, BMK turns in a very strong performance in Table III, with energy errors in

13

close proximity to hybrid functionals that employ a much smaller fraction of exact exchange

(15-25%). The gradient and thus geometry errors are somewhat larger, and probably in the

range of a good meta-GGA or GGA functional such as HCTH/407.

Another important indication of the reliability of the functionals are frequency calcula-

tions. These are especially important in order to ﬁnd out if a functional has been ‘overﬁtted’.

In this instance, the gradients would become quite small and achieve a small gradient er-

ror for the wrong reason: The gradients at any geometry would be small, even if far away

from equilibrium. This would result in a ﬂat potential energy surface and thus in too low

frequencies[71]. In order to ensure a balanced evaluation set (including organic molecules)

and reliable data, we have mainly used CCSD(T)/cc-pVQZ, CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVQZ, and

CCSD(T)/ANO4321 harmonic frequencies from the literature (we may assume that these

values are quite accurate because of known error cancellation[72] between core-correlation

and post-CCSD(T) correlation eﬀects)[73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85].

Using these reference values, we included the following molecules: C2H2, C2H4, C6H6, CCl2,

CF2, CF4, CH2NH, CH4, CO, CO2, F2, FCCH, H2, H2CO, H2O, H2SiO, HCN, HF, cis-

HSiOH, trans-HSiOH, N2, cis-N2H2, iso-N2H2, trans-N2H2, N2O, NH3, SiH4, SiF4, SO2,

SO3, and s-tetrazine. This makes for a total of 202 distinct harmonic frequencies: all

computed values are given in the Supplementary Material[67], while mean signed, mean

absolute, and RMS errors over the whole set are displayed in Table IV. We investigated

the performance of the BP86, BLYP, HCTH/407 and PBE GGA functionals, together with

B3LYP, B97-1, B97-2, PBE0, KMLYP, mPW1K, B97-K and BMK. For technical reasons,

the BMK frequencies have been calculated by numerical diﬀerentiation of gradients. For the

harmonic frequencies investigated, GGA functionals generally underestimate, and hybrid

functionals with large fractions of exact exchange overestimate, the coupled-cluster values.

Among the GGA functionals, HCTH/407 clearly yields the lowest errors, underestimating

the frequencies by an average 30 cm−1. There is little diﬀerence between the hybrid func-

tionals B3LYP, B97-1, B97-2 and PBE0, with an improvement of 17% by B97-1 compared

to B3LYP. Our investigations[85] indicate that this improvement for B97-1 largely derives

from organic molecules, which are described even better than with B3LYP. Generally, the

geometry gradient errors in Table III seem to transfer rather well into frequency errors for

these functionals, with B97-K and BMK yielding errors comparable to a functional like

HCTH/407. Again, KMLYP and mPW1K yield frequency errors as bad or even worse than

14

GGA functionals.

Hydrogen bonded complexes serve as another commonly used test for density functionals.

Ab initio calculations on such systems converge quite rapidly with the electron correlation

treatment (thanks to the long-range character of the interaction studied) but very slowly

with the basis set[86], both with and without counterpoise[87] corrections. Since the use of

extrapolation schemes almost eliminates the basis set superposition errors for atomization

energies[88] and hydrogen-bonded complexes such as the ammonia dimer[64], it is safe to

assume that use of standard W2 theory[45] will suﬃce. Further touchstones for hydrogen-

bonded complexes include the lengths of the hydrogen-bonds and hydrogen-bonded shifts

calculated using CCSD(T)/aug’-cc-pVTZ. The harmonic frequency shifts are obtained at

the MP2/aug’-cc-pVTZ level. We have computed reference values for nine hydrogen bonded

complexes which were also used in a previous study[30], in addition to the ammonia dimer.

All these values (Table V), with the exception of the MP2 frequency shifts (for which

we would expect a deviation of about 15%), should be very accurate.

In Table VI, the

MP2 methods tested, counterpoise corrections are generally on the order of about 0.5-

2.0 kJ/mol, which is sometimes still quite large relative to the interaction energies being

considered. For the reference W2 values, all residual basis set superposition error (BSSE) is

likely to have been eliminated. Thus, we would expect the mean error to change by +2-3%,

so that the mean percentual error of MP2 in Table V will be approximately zero, and the

functionals underestimating the interaction energy (like HCTH/407 and B3LYP) will become

more accurate. All the computed values can be found in the supplementary material[67].

Generally, it is believed that MP2 renders much more accurate results than density functional

theory for hydrogen-bonded systems. Overall, the consistency of results of MP2 is only

matched by one functional, surprisingly B97-K. The errors of this functional are low for all

tested properties, from the dissociation energy to the frequency shift of the hydrogen bond.

BMK, on the other hand, renders a mediocre performance, which looks quite similar to the

B97-2 functional. Concerning the dissociation energies, HCTH/407 is the only functional

giving an RMS % error of less than 10. Only the hydrogen bond distance itself is consistently

overestimated by about 4%. The same is true for B97-1: For all properties investigated it

15

yields low errors, except for the geometry shift. Generally, hybrid functionals are more

accurate than GGA functionals (with HCTH/407 yielding particularly good dissociation

energies and BLYP hydrogen bond lengths), which are in turn much more accurate than

the other two ‘kinetics’ functionals investigated. mPW1K shows the behavior we would

expect from the HF method, i.e., underestimating the interaction energy, the hydrogen and

frequency shifts by about 40%, and overestimating the bond length. KMLYP on the other

hand shows some behavior normally associated with a functional ﬁt to the uniform electron

gas, such as LSDA: The interaction energy and the shifts are overestimated and the bond

length underestimated. Overall, the new functionals show much improved performance for

hydrogen bonded complexes, with B97-K, surprisingly, clearly yields the lowest error of all

functionals tested.

Finally, we will consider performance of BMK and other functionals for transition states

outside our training set. Unlike for the latter, all transition states will be optimized with

the functional and basis set used. The results are presented in detail in Table S-1 in the

Electronic Supplement[70]: summary error statistics can be found in Table VII. The source

of the reference values was indicated in the second column of Table S-1. Entries 1–24 are the

reactions from the training set. The remainder are a large subset of the reactions considered

by Kang and Musgrave in the KMLYP paper[37], and ﬁnally the reactions from the recent

paper of Houk and coworkers[89] on pericyclic reactions like ring closings, hydrogen shifts

and Diels-Alder reactions. For this class of reactions, Houk and coworkers found average

errors ranging from 1.7 to 3.2 kcal/mol for several hybrid functionals. It should be noted

that the average uncertainty of the experimental values is itself 0.7 kcal/mol, casting some

doubt on the validity of overly detailed comparisons for these systems. In one case (the ring

closing of 1,3-butadiene to cyclobutene), the 0.2 kcal/mol stated uncertainty appears to be

somewhat optimistic: our computed W1 barrier deviates by 1.8 kcal/mol changing by at

most 0.1 kcal/mol when computed at diﬀerent calculated reference geometries, despite the

absence of signiﬁcant nondynamical correlation. The other reactions we investigated were

the hydrogen shifts of 1,3-cyclopentadiene and 1,3 pentadiene, again with the result that

the experimental values might have larger deviations than their given uncertainties: For

the former we found a diﬀerence of 2.2 kcal/mol (which is close to their CBS-GB3 number

reported), compared to the stated uncertainty of 0.5 kcal/mol. For the latter, the W1 result

is somewhat closer to experiment with a deviation of 0.7 kcal/mol, the reported uncertainty

16

being 0.5 kcal/mol. In all three cases, the experimental barriers are lower than our computed

values.

In addition, the experimental numbers of Kang and Musgrave (marked with footnote

symbol a) deviate signiﬁcantly from the ones reported by Truhlar and co-workers for reactions

19–24. This casts some doubt on the accuracy of the former: However, since we do not have

any other data available for many reactions, we will still use this set for comparison.

In Table S-1, we have tested mPW1K, KMLYP, B3LYP, B97-1, and B97-2 together with

the two newly obtained density functionals and the spdf basis set combination described

in the Computational Methods section. We will refrain from the use of small basis sets

in order to calculate transition states, in order not to blur our comparison with additional

error sources such as BSSE and basis set incompleteness eﬀects on reference geometries.

During pre-optimizations, we in fact found that in some diﬃcult cases, we were unable to

locate a transition state with a basis set like 6-31+G*. Overall, the functionals developed

for transition states show a strong performance throughout for the barriers. The B97-1 and

B3LYP functionals yield very inconsistent results: While some reaction barriers are actually

overestimated, many transition states cannot be found at all, lie below the reactants in

energy (albeit above the entry channel long distance complex: examples were previously

reported for SN 2 reactions[9, 60]), or are underestimated by up to 10 kcal/mol (e.g. for the

transition state of the CH3F + H → CH3 + HF reaction, # 63). For most reactions, B97-1

does even worse than B3LYP, usually underestimating barriers by an additional kcal/mol.

It is somewhat peculiar that the forward reactions of the type AH + H → A + H2 show a

lower error for B97-1 (reactions 9–15, 36, 38, 39, 53, 63–65, and 70) than for B3LYP, with

the opposite eﬀect seen for the reverse reactions of this type (reactions 6, 7, 19, 20, and 49).

B97-2 usually predicts somewhat higher barriers than B97-1.

We will now turn to the summary error statistics in Table VII. Compared to Table III

— where we calculated single-point energies at the QCISD geometries — the RMS errors of

all functionals are minimized further. The BMK functional yields the lowest mean absolute

error of 1.1 kcal/mol, showing a similar performance to B97-K and mPW1K. KMLYP yields

results between the functionals which have 20% (B3LYP, B97-1) exact exchange and the ones

having around 42% (BMK, B97-K, and mPW1K). While B97-2 represents an improvement

over B97-1 (as noted in Ref.[90]), performance for barrier heights is still clearly inferior to

BMK, as well as to B97-K and mPW1K. (B97-2 and KMLYP are somewhat more closely

17

matched.)

For the fourth set of Houk and co-workers in Table VII, we reported error statistics to

either ten (25–34) or eight (25–32) reactions because of the discrepancies of the various

computed values among each other and with experiment for reactions 33–35, particularly

the last one. For this set, B97-1 is the only functional that underestimates the transition

barriers on average and shows the lowest RMS error. The RMS errors of BMK and mPW1K

are worse by about 0.7 kcal/mol, followed by B3LYP, B97-K and KMLYP.

Finally, the results obtained for our training set (reactions 1–24 in Table S-1) are further

validated by comparing to Kang and Musgrave’s experimental numbers and their CBS-

APNO calculations. Here, KMLYP yields errors comparable to the other functionals de-

veloped for transition states, probably because they used this set for determining their

functional. Again, B3LYP and B97-1 show poor performance, B97-2 less so. As Kang and

Musgrave have already reported, G2 also yields very large errors, overestimating the exper-

imental numbers by an average of 3 kcal/mol. For transition states, G2 seems to be less

accurate than the functionals tested. This should not surprise the reader, considering the

heavy reliance on low-order perturbation theory — which often has problems with transi-

tion states because of its hypersensitivity to nondynamical correlation eﬀects — in the G2

method.

Summarizing this section, without the two new functionals one is in a dilemma about

whether to compromise on the accuracy of equilibrium energetics (with transition-state

biased functionals like mPW1K and KMLYP, compare Tables III, IV and VI with Tables

VII and S-1) or on that of barrier heights (with traditional general-purpose functionals).

B97-K and in particular BMK allow users to ‘have their cake and eat it too’. In fact, overall

performance of BMK for all properties considered here is such that it can legitimately be

considered a general-purpose functional, albeit with its applicability extended to transition

states.

V. CONCLUSIONS

Prior to this work, all exchange-correlation functionals that consistently perform reliably

for transition states and barrier heights (such as BH&HLYP, mPW1K and KMLYP) achieve

this feat at the expense of seriously degraded performance for all other properties. We have

18

developed two new exchange-correlation functionals suitable for transition states, the hy-

brid GGA functional B97-K (Becke-97 for kinetics) and the hybrid meta-GGA functional

BMK (Boese-Martin for kinetics). These functionals, especially BMK, were parametrized

against very large and diverse training sets. Both functionals achieve performance similar

to mPW1K for transition states. However, B97-K and especially BMK perform much more

reliably for more general properties than those earlier specialized functionals. Overall per-

formance of B97-K is intermediate between mPW1K and the very reliable B97-1 functional

(except for perhaps fortuitously excellent performance for hydrogen bonds); the BMK func-

tional actually outperforms B3LYP for most properties and is competitive with the best

currently available functionals for equilibrium energetics.

Its performance for geometries

and vibrational frequencies is somewhat less good than B3LYP but markedly superior to all

available specialized functionals for transition states. Unlike these latter, BMK can actually

be considered a reliable general-purpose functional whose capabilities have been expanded

to cover transition states.

To computational chemists engaged in mechanistic studies, BMK oﬀers a single functional

capable of describing all aspects of the potential surface (energetics, kinetics, structures,...)

Initial experiments for electrical properties (to be reported on in a future paper) yield promis-

ing results as well, in part because self-interaction error issues are less acute for functionals

with high percentages of Hartree-Fock exchange.

The surprisingly good performance of BMK appears to hinge on the combination of

a high percentage of Hartree-Fock exchange with terms dependent on the kinetic energy

density. The latter appears to aﬀord a ‘back-correction’ for excessive Hartree-Fock exchange

in systems where it is undesirable, and in eﬀect to simulate variable exact exchange to some

extent. Some evidence exists that the same properties of BMK make it more suitable for

describing transition metal complexes than other hybrid functionals. These observations

should shed some light on the problem of developing both more accurate and more widely

applicable functionals than currently available.

In sum, we believe we have added a very useful tool to the computational chemist’s

toolbox.

Note added in revision

A referee drew our attention to a recent paper by Zhao et al.[91] in which a successor

to mPW1K, denoted BB1K (Becke-Becke 1-parameter for kinetics) was proposed. This

functional combines the Becke 1988 GGA exchange functional[3] with Hartree-Fock exchange

and Becke’s 1995 meta-GGA correlation functional[92]. The percentage of Hartree-Fock

exchange is empirically adjusted to minimize the RMS error over a small dataset of nine

barrier heights, the optimum value turning out to be 42% like in the present BMK functional.

Clearly, this functional was not as broadly and comprehensively parametrized as BMK or

even B97-K. Furthermore, Becke himself[13] states: ”The functional of Part IV [i.e., Ref.[92]]

is problematic in very weakly bound systems... and is therefore not recommended. This

will be corrected in future publications.” In summary, we have reason to believe that the

present BMK functional will be considerably more reliable and widely applicable than the

one proposed in Ref.[91].

Abstract

A benchmark ab initio and density functional (DFT) study has been carried

out on the electron aﬃnities of the ﬁrst- and second- row atoms. The ab initio

study involves basis sets of spdf gh and spdf ghi quality, extrapolations to the

1-particle basis set limit, and a combination of the CCSD(T), CCSDT, and

full CI electron correlation methods. Scalar relativistic and spin-orbit coupling

eﬀects were taken into account. On average, the best ab initio results agree to

better than 0.001 eV with the most recent experimental results. Correcting

for imperfections in the CCSD(T) method improves the mean absolute error

by an order of magnitude, while for accurate results on the second-row atoms

inclusion of relativistic corrections is essential. The latter are signiﬁcantly

overestimated at the SCF level; for accurate spin-orbit splitting constants of

second-row atoms inclusion of (2s,2p) correlation is essential. In the DFT cal-

culations it is found that results for the 1st-row atoms are very sensitive to the

exchange functional, while those for second-row atoms are rather more sensi-

1

tive to the correlation functional. While the LYP correlation functional works

best for ﬁrst-row atoms, its PW91 counterpart appears to be preferable for

second-row atoms. Among “pure DFT” (nonhybrid) functionals, G96PW91

(Gill 1996 exchange combined with Perdew-Wang 1991 correlation) puts in

the best overall performance, actually slightly better than the popular hybrid

B3LYP functional. B3PW91 outperforms B3LYP, while the recently pro-

posed 1-parameter hybrid functionals such as B1LYP seem clearly superior

to B3LYP and B3PW91 for ﬁrst-row atoms. The best results overall are ob-

tained with the 1-parameter hybrid modiﬁed Perdew-Wang (mPW1) exchange

functionals of Adamo and Barone [J. Chem. Phys. 108, 664 (1998)], with

mPW1LYp yielding the best results for ﬁrst-row, and mPW1PW91 for second-

row atoms. Indications exist that a hybrid of the type a mPW1LYP+ (1 − a)

mPW1PW91 yields better results than either of the constituent functionals.

I. INTRODUCTION

The electron aﬃnity (EA) of a system is the energy required for the reaction

A− → A + e−

(1)

Electron aﬃnities have traditionally been regarded as one of the hardest atomic or molec-

ular properties to reproduce in an ab initio quantum mechanical calculation. For starters,

they involve a change in the number of valence electrons correlated in the system, and hence

are very taxing tests for any electron correlation method. In addition, they involve a pro-

nounced change in the spatial extent of the wave function, making them very demanding in

terms of the basis set as well.

The electron aﬃnities of the ﬁrst-and second-row atoms have often been used as bench-

marks [1–16] for high-level electronic structure methods since (a) many of them are known

experimentally to very high precision (e.g. [17]); (b) no such complications as geometry relax-

2

ation are involved; and (c) the computational demands required are still relatively modest.

Until recently, three of the ﬁrst-and second-row atomic electron aﬃnities were imprecisely

known experimentally (B, Al, and Si): this situation was changed very recently by high-

precision measurements in recent experiments for B [18], Al [19,20], and Si [21].

Density functional theory [22–24] allows a cost-eﬀective introduction of electron cor-

relation via the Kohn-Sham method [25] and the use of exchange-correlation functionals.

However, since the systematic extension of these functionals towards the exact solution of

the Schr¨odinger equations is not possible hitherto, calculated results have to be compared

with ab initio wave function calculations or experiment in order to judge their reliability

and quality. In recent years, many studies have evolved testing the performance of density

functional methods in the calculation of atomic and molecular properties. One of these

properties which can be used to critically test the available exchange-correlation functionals

are electron aﬃnities.

DFT electron aﬃnities have already been obtained by a number of groups. Pople et al.

investigated the performance of the B-LYP exchange correlation functional in the calculation

of atomization energies, ionization energies, electron aﬃnities and proton aﬃnities using the

6-31G(d), 6-31+G(d), 6-311+G(2df,p) and 6-311+G(3df,2p) basis sets [26]. In a test on the

molecules of the well-known G2 thermochemical data set [27], a mean absolute deviation

from experiment of 0.137 eV for the electron aﬃnities (25 molecules) was found for the

largest basis set. In a previous contribution [28], two of us have studied ionization potentials

and electron aﬃnities using the hybrid functionals B3LYP and B3PW91 and Dunning’s

correlation consistent basis sets [29]. For the largest basis set studied (i.e. the AVTZ basis),

a mean absolute deviation from experiment of 0.13 eV for both of these functionals was found

in the calculation of electron aﬃnities for the G2 set of molecules. Schaefer and coworkers

have studied electron aﬃnities for a variety of systems: sulphur ﬂuorides [30], phosphorus

ﬂuorides [31], monochlorine ﬂuorides [32] and silicon ﬂuorides [33]. Galbraith and Schaefer

[34] also evaluated the electron aﬃnities for F and F2 using a number of exchange-correlation

3

functionals and the AVDZ, AVTZ, AVQZ and AV5Z basis sets. Moreover, they studied the

atomic electron aﬃnities for the ﬁrst row elements, 12 ﬁrst row diatomic and 15 ﬁrst row

triatomic molecules using 6 diﬀerent functional, amongst which some hybrid functionals [35].

It was found that for their series of tested molecules, the BLYP functional provided the best

agreement with experiment, the overall absolute error being 0.21 eV. For the B3LYP, BP86

and BHLYP functionals, the absolute error lies around 0.3 eV, whereas the B3P86 and LDA

errors are around 0.7 eV. Recently, Curtiss et al [36] studied the performance of density

functional methods in the calculation of ionization energies and electron aﬃnities on the so-

called G2 ion test set, which consists of the 63 atoms and molecules whose ionization energies

and electron aﬃnities were included in the original G2 test set, supplemented with 83 atoms

and molecules. Thus, they determined the performance of the seven exchange correlation

functionals in the calculation of 58 electron aﬃties. It was conclude that for this set and

the 6-311+(3df,2p) basis set, the mean absolute deviations were 0.697 eV (LDA), 0,113 eV

(BLYP), 0.121 eV (BPW91), 0.193 eV (BP86), 0.131 eV (B3LYP), 0.145 eV (B3PW91) and

0.596 eV (B3P86).

The purpose of the present work is twofold. First of all, we will try to establish whether

present-day state-of-the-art wavefunction based methods will consistently yield ‘the right

result for the right reason’. As a by-product, we will obtain basis set limit values for the

nonrelativistic, clamped-nuclei electron aﬃnities, which will serve for the second purpose.

This involves the testing of the performance and basis set dependence of diﬀerent exchange-

correlation density functionals in the calculation of these electron aﬃnities.

II. COMPUTATIONAL METHODS

A. Density functional calculations

Density functional calculations were performed using Gaussian 94 [37] running on the

Cray J916/8-1024 of the Brussels Free Universities Computer Centre, and Gaussian 98 [38]

4

running on the SGI Origin 2000 of the Faculty of Chemistry at the Weizmann Institute of

Science.

In order to account for possible errors in the numerical integration due to the diﬀuseness

of the charge density, in particular of course for the anions, and the high angular momentum

in the basis set, a ﬁne grid of 590 angular Lebedev nodes and 99 radial nodes was used and

tightened convergence criteria for the Kohn-Sham equations were speciﬁed, such that the

tabulated results for the electron aﬃnities can be considered precise to 10−4 eV.

A wide variety of exchange-correlation functionals Exc was considered. Among the “pure

DFT” functionals, these are the following:

• The Local Density Approximation (LDA), which actually uses Slater’s expression for

exchange (S) [39] and Vosko, Wilk and Nusair’s expression for the correlation energy

of the uniform electron gas [40], parametrized using Ceperley and Alder’s quantum

Monte-Carlo results [41];

• The gradient corrected B-LYP,B-P86 and B-PW91 functionals, which are combinations

of Becke’s 1988 (B88, or simply B) gradient-corrected exchange functional [42] with

correlation functionals due to Lee, Yang, and Parr (LYP) [43], Perdew (P86) [44], and

Perdew and Wang (PW91) [45], respectively;

• The combination of the PW91 correlation functional with the exchange functional

proposed in the same paper [45], a combination usually denoted by the acronym GGA91

for Generalized Gradient Approximation-1991

• Combinations of the LYP and PW91 correlation functionals with the 1996 exchange

functional proposed by Gill [46], denoted G96LYP and G96PW91, respectively

Among “hybrid” functionals (i.e. those having a nonzero coeﬃcient for the true Hartree-

Fock exchange EHF

x

) we have considered the following:

• The popular B3LYP [47,48] functional, which takes the form

5

Exc = ax0ELDA

x

+ (1 − ax0)EHF

x + ax1∆EB88

x + (1 − ac)ELDA

c

+ acELY P

c

(2)

in which the three constants ax0 = 0.80, ax1 = 0.72, ac = 0.81 were originally empir-

ically determined by Becke [47] using the P86 correlation functional, and the imple-

mentation in the Gaussian series of programs [48] uses the VWN functional 3 [40] for

ELDA
c

rather than the VWN functional 5 employed by Becke [47]

• the B3PW91 functional, which has the same form as the B3LYP functional except that

EP W 91
c

is used instead of ELY P

c

• a number of the new one-parameter hybrid functionals proposed by Adamo and Barone

Exc = a0EHF

x + (1 − a0)(ELDA

x

+ ∆EGC

x

) + Ec

(3)

in which ∆EGC

x

is some gradient correction to the exchange functional (e.g. B88, PW91,

G96), and Ec represents any suitable correlation functional. From an analysis [49] based

on perturbation theory, a0 takes the nonempirical value 1/4. In the present paper, we

have considered B1LYP and B1PW91 [50] (i.e. the 1-parameter analogs of B3LYP and

B3PW91), as well as the newer LG1LYP functional [51] which uses the Lacks-Gordon

[52] expression for EGC

x

and the mPW1LYP and mPW1PW91 functionals [53], in

which the nonlocal exchange is given by a modiﬁcation of EP W 91

for better treatment

x

of long-range interactions (the small density, large gradient regime).

B. Ab initio calculations

The CCSDT (coupled cluster with all single, double, and triple excitations [54]) calcula-

tions were carried out using ACES II [55] running on a DEC Alpha 500/500 workstation at

the Weizmann Institute of Science; all other ab initio calculations reported in this work were

carried out using MOLPRO 98.1 [56] running on a Silicon Graphics Octane workstation at

the Weizmann Institute.

6

The valence calculations were carried out using the augmented correlation-consistent

valence n-tuple

zeta (aug-cc-pVnZ, or AVnZ for

short) basis

sets of Dunning

and coworkers

[8].

The contracted sizes

for

the various AVnZ basis

sets

for

[second-row/ﬁrst-row/hydrogen] atoms are as follows: AVDZ [5s4p2d/4s3p2d/3s2p],

AVTZ [6s5p3d2f/5s4p3d2f/4s3p2d], AVQZ [7s6p4d3f2g/6s5p4d3f2g/5s4p3d2f], AV5Z

[8s7p5d4f3g2h/7s6p5d4f3g2h/6s5p4d3f2g];

in addition, for ﬁrst-row and hydrogen atoms

only, we considered AV6Z [8s7p6d5f4g3h2i/7s6p5d4f3g2h].

Except where indicated otherwise, ROHF (restricted open-shell Hartree-Fock) reference

wave functions were used throughout.

The SCF component of the total energy was extrapolated using a geometric expression

[57] of the type A + B/C n applied to AVnZ energies with n=Q, 5, 6 for ﬁrst-row atoms and

n=T, Q, 5 for second-row atoms. The CCSD(T) (coupled cluster with all single and double

excitations and a quasiperturbative treatment of connected triple excitations [58–60]) valence

correlation energy was extrapolated using both the 3-parameter expression A + B/(n+1/2)α

proposed by one of us [61] and the two-parameter expression A+ B/n3 proposed by Helgaker

and coworkers [62]: both expressions are based on the known asymptotic convergence be-

havior [63,64] of pair correlation energies as a function of the maximum angular momentum

present in the basis set.

Imperfections in the treatment of connected triple excitations are corrected for by means

of CCSDT calculations in the AVQZ basis set. Finally, the eﬀect of connected quadruple

and higher excitations is approximated by full conﬁguration interaction (FCI) in the largest

basis set where this is feasible with the Knowles-Handy [65] determinantal code. For B and

Al, this is AVQZ; for C and Si, AVTZ; for the other elements AVDZ.

The eﬀect of inner-shell correlation was determined as the diﬀerence between valence-

only and all-electron CCSD(T) calculations using the Martin-Taylor [66,67] family of core-

correlation basis sets. The MTavqz basis set corresponds to a completely uncontracted

AVQZ basis set augmented with 1p3d2f high-exponent functions of which the exponents are

7

obtained by successively multiplying the largest exponent already present in that angular

momentum with a factor of 3.0. The MTav5z basis set was similarly obtained from the AV5Z

basis set but with 1p3d2f 1g high-exponent functions added.

Scalar relativistic eﬀects were approximated by the ﬁrst-order perturbation correction

[68,69] of the Darwin and mass-velocity (DMV) terms. For technical reasons, these calcula-

tions were carried at at the ACPF (averaged coupled pair functional [70]) level. Since great

ﬂexibility in the s and p functions is essential for this type of eﬀect, we employed the MTavqz

basis set throughout for this contribution.

Spin-orbit coupling constants were evaluated at the CASSCF-CI level using the spdf part

of the MTav5z basis set. (For a recent review of the methodology involved, see Ref. [71].)

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

A summary of our computed results and their diﬀerent components is presented in Table

I together with the experimental results, while a selection of previously computed literature

values is presented in Table II.

A. First-row atoms

An indication for the error introduced by our use of ﬁnite basis sets and extrapolations

can be obtained from our results for the EA of hydrogen atom, for which the computed

results represent exact solutions within the respective ﬁnite basis sets.

The three-point geometric extrapolation for the SCF component adds only about 0.0001

eV to the largest-basis set (AV6Z) result. The 2-point Halkier extrapolation, however, still

adds some 0.0041 eV to the ﬁnal result. The latter, 0.75416 eV, agrees excellently with

the most precise measurement, 0.754195(19) eV [17]; the somewhat higher observed value

for deuterium, 0.754593(74) ev [17], suggests that deviations from the Born-Oppenheimer

approximation (not considered in the present work) may account for 0.0002–0.0004 eV; hence

8

this is probably a more realistic assessment of the residual error in our calculation than the

diﬀerence of 0.00004 eV between computed and observed EAs. The only term other than SCF

and valence correlation which contributes to our computed result is an essentially negligible

(4×10−5 eV) contribution of Darwin and mass-velocity (DMV) eﬀects.

The electron aﬃnity of the boron atom, imprecisely known for a long time, was very

recently redetermined to high accuracy by Scheer et al. [18] as 0.279723(25) eV, in perfect

agreement with a very recent relativistic coupled cluster calculation by Eliav et al. [6] in

an exceedingly large [35s26p20d14f 9g6h4i] basis set, as well as the numerical relativistic

MCSCF calculation by Fischer et al. [7]. Our present best calculated result, 0.27858 eV,

meets the 0.001 eV accuracy target using no larger basis sets than [8s7p6d5f 4g3h2i]. Again,

the basis set extrapolation beyond AV6Z amounts to essentially nil for the SCF contribution

but 0.004 eV for the valence correlation energy. The n-particle space calibration, in this case,

was carried out at the FCI/AVQZ level, and amounts to no less than 0.0191 eV — about

three-quarters of which consists of imperfections in the treatment of connected triples. As

a more extreme case of a general trend, the results reﬂect imbalance between the quality of

the CCSD(T) treatment for neutral and anion — in this case close to exact for B but rather

less so for B−. Inner-shell correlation increases EA by 0.0043 eV, while DMV eﬀects reduce

EA by 0.0013 eV and spin-orbit eﬀects by another 0.0006 eV.

Our best calculation for carbon, 1.26298 eV, agrees to within experimental uncertainty

with the experimental value 1.2629(3) eV. The amounts bridged by the extrapolation parallel

those found for H and B. n-particle calibration accounts for 0.013 eV, split about 2:1 between

imperfections in the treatment of connected triples and eﬀects of connected higher excita-

tions. Spin-orbit and scalar relativistic eﬀects lower the EA by 0.003 eV each. Inner-shell

correlation has the highest contribution of the ﬁrst-row atoms, 0.007 eV.

Nitrogen atom has no bound anion. For oxygen, our best calculation is within 0.0005

eV of the very precisely known experimental value. In this case, extrapolation even from

the AV6Z basis set contributes a solid 0.016 eV to the ﬁnal result — it should be noted

9

that the valence correlation component of EA is almost three times larger in absolute value

than that in C. While the spin-orbit contributions largely compensate between neutral and

anion (reﬂected in the fairly small EA contribution of -0.002 eV), the DMV contribution

is relatively important at -0.006 eV (as expected). The n-particle correction, at 0.012 eV,

largely consists of eﬀects of connected quadruple and higher excitations — the diﬀerence

between CCSDT and CCSD(T) only amounts to about 0.002 eV.

The EA for F has traditionally been known as one of the very hardest quantities to

reproduce from a theoretical calculation. Our calculated value is 0.004 eV higher than the

experimental result — which is still close to 0.1% accuracy relatively speaking. The basis

set extrapolation covers similar amounts as in O, while both the spin-orbit (-0.016 eV)

and DMV (-0.009 eV) contributions are quite sizable. Inner-shell correlation contributes a

similar amount as in B. The main uncertain factor in our calculation is the deceptively small

n-particle calibration contribution of 0.0006 eV, which is actually the result of a cancellation

between imperfections in the CCSD(T) treatment of connected triple excitations (-0.009 eV)

on the one hand, and the eﬀect of connected higher excitations (+0.010 eV) on the other

hand. Unfortunately the largest basis set in which we could carry out FCI calculations was

AVDZ, but we expect the FCI-CCSDT diﬀerence to converge as fast as in the case of B or

C. The considerable basis set variation of the CCSDT-CCSD(T) diﬀerences as well as the

clear downward trend, progressing from +0.003 eV (AVDZ) over -0.006 eV (AVTZ) to -0.009

eV (AVQZ) strongly suggests that this diﬀerence would be substantially larger near the n-

particle basis set limit. If we assume an A+ B/l3 extrapolation for this diﬀerence (equivalent

to carrying out a valence correlation extrapolation on CCSDT rather than CCSD(T) values

for this case) we obtain a further lowering by 0.002 eV, bringing the calculated EA down to

3.4031 eV, within 0.002 eV of the experimental value of 3.401190(4) eV.

Of previously computed results for F, Gutsev et al. (CCSDT/AV5Z, 3.395 eV) and Cur-

tiss et al. (G3 theory, 3.400 eV) are both in excellent agreement with experiment. However,

the former includes neither spin-orbit nor DMV contributions, and their inclusion would

10

reduce the result to 3.370 eV. The G3 value does include spin-orbit terms (experimentally

derived) but not DMV, and would be reduced to 3.391 eV upon inclusion of the latter.

B. Second-row atoms

The previously rather imprecisely known [17] EA of aluminum was very recently redeter-

mined. Calabrese et al. [19] obtained 0.44094(66) eV, while Scheer et al. [20] obtained the

more precise, and substantially lower value 0.43283(5) eV. Our own calculations agree to four

ﬁgures with this latter value. Extrapolation of the valence correlation contribution beyond

AV5Z accounts for only 0.0036 eV, while inclusion of inner-shell correlation lowers EA by

0.016 eV, almost perfectly cancelling the increase of 0.015 eV from n-particle correction. As

in isovalent B, imperfections in the treatment of connected triples in CCSD(T) make up the

bulk of that eﬀect. Spin-orbit coupling and scalar relativistic eﬀects weigh in at -0.0038 and

-0.0054 eV, respectively.

The EA of Si was very recently revised to 1.38946(6) eV by Thogersen et al. [21]. Our own

calculation comes within 0.001 eV of that value. With a substantial spin-orbit splitting in

Si(3P ) and none at all in Si−(4S), we ﬁnd the spin-orbit contribution to EA to be the second-

largest of the atoms surveyed, -0.018 eV, while scalar relativistic eﬀects are less substantial

at -0.008 eV. Basis set extrapolation bridges 0.006 eV in this case; inner-shell correlation is

less prominent than in Al but still aﬀects the result by -0.010 eV, which interestingly again

nearly cancels the n-particle calibration correction. The latter is about evenly split between

imperfections in the treatment of connected triple excitations and the eﬀects of connected

quadruple and higher excitations.

In the ﬁnal three atoms, basis set convergence appears to be particularly slow, as wit-

nessed by the fact that extrapolations from AVQZ and AV5Z results cover 0.023, 0.026, and

0.030 eV, respectively, for P, S, and Cl. When using AV5Z and AV6Z results for Cl, some

0.017 eV is still bridged. Under these circumstances, it is not surprising that accuracy would

be somewhat lower; and indeed, our computed results for P, S, and Cl are too low by about

11

0.002 eV on average.

Given how diﬀuse particularly the P anion is (the isovalent N anion is not even bound),

one might wonder whether even the AVnZ basis sets are suﬃciently saturated in the anion

region. In an attempt to establish this, we have carried out calculations for P, S, and Cl

using dAVnZ (doubly-augmented VnZ) basis sets, in which the additional set of diﬀuse

functions was generated simply by multiplying the lowest exponents already present by

0.25. Particularly for P, but less so for S and Cl, there is a nontrivial diﬀerence between

AVQZ/AV5Z and dAVQZ/dAV5Z extrapolated limits: 0.0021 eV for P, and 0.0011 eV for

S and Cl. This leads to revised values that are in perfect agreement with experiment for P

and S, while the revised result for Cl is only 0.0015 eV too low.

Aside from these speciﬁc remarks, we can make some general observations.

First of all, the mean absolute deviation between our best computed ab initio values and

the most recent experimental values is only 0.0009 eV, with the largest individual error,

0.0018 eV, seen for P. To the best of our knowledge (see Table II), this level of accuracy is

unprecedented in the literature for this property.

The inclusion of corrections for imperfections in the CCSD(T) method is absolutely

indispensable for this level of accuracy: neglecting them raises the mean absolute error by

more than an order of magnitude, to 0.009 eV. This contribution, as noted above, is generally

dominated by corrections for imperfections in the treatment of connected triple excitations,

i.e. the diﬀerence between CCSD(T) and CCSDT.

The contribution of inner-shell correlation stabilizes the anion over the neutral in the

ﬁrst-row atoms:

in absolute value, it goes through a maximum for C although in relative

terms, it monotonically decreases in importance from left to right in the periodic table. For

second-row atoms, core correlation stabilizes the neutral over the anion, and monotonically

decreases from left to right in the Periodic Table.

As expected, the contribution of scalar relativistic (Darwin and mass-velocity, DMV)

eﬀects mounts from left to right within each row, and is more important for the second row

12

than for the ﬁrst row. As seen in Table III, our relativistic contributions follow the same

trends as those obtained in the numerical SCF calculations of Garc´ıa de la Vega [72] and of

Koga et al. [73], particularly the consistent favoring of the more compact neutral atom over

the more diﬀuse anion. However, in absolute value our ACPF/MTav5z calculated DMV con-

tributions are systematically smaller than the numerical HF results; the diﬀerence increases

from left to right in the Periodic Table and becomes fairly substantial for F and Cl. As

is readily seen by comparing SCF/MTav5z and ACPF/MTav5z results, this mostly reﬂects

the eﬀect of electron correlation on the correction, which one would intuitively expect to

decrease the eﬀect of a one-electron property that is most important for the inner-shell elec-

trons. Comparison of MTavqz and MTav5z results reveals that our computed contributions

are converged in terms of the basis set to ≤ 5 × 10−5 eV at the ACPF level and ≤ 10−5 eV

at the SCF level. The small diﬀerence between the present SCF level contributions and the

numerical HF results reﬂects the inclusion of some additional scalar relativistic eﬀects in the

latter, particularly the two-electron Darwin term which we did not consider. Evidently their

importance, at the Hartree-Fock level, mounts from −0.00004 eV for B or −0.0001 eV for Al

to about −0.0008–9 eV for F and Cl. It is not a priori clear how electron correlation would

aﬀect these contributions, although a reduction in importance would seem plausible.

The spin-orbit contributions likewise mount from left to right and from top to bottom

in the Periodic Table; however, because such systems as C−, Si−, and P do not exhibit any

ﬁrst-order spin-orbit splitting, the contributions to EA at ﬁrst sight seem more erratic.

To the accuracy relevant here, it hardly appears to matter whether the observed or the

best computed ﬁne structures are used for calculating the spin-orbit contribution. As seen in

Table IV, the computed values are clearly near convergence with respect to the basis set. For

the ﬁrst-row atoms, the CASSCF values are quite close to experiment but this holds much

less true for the second-row atoms. Inclusion of external valence correlation usually seems

to lower the computed values and bring them away from experiment, while the inclusion of

(2s, 2p) correlation for the second-row atoms leads to a dramatic improvement in the quality

13

of the results. Inclusion of correlation from the deep-lying (1s) orbitals has little eﬀect on

the second-row results, as expected, but for ﬁrst-row atoms a somewhat greater contribution

is seen.

Of the previous calculations summarized in Table II, the one systematic study that most

closely reproduces our present benchmark values are the very recent benchmark calculations

of Gdanitz [1], which were carried out using a variant of the multireference ACPF [70] method

involving explicit interelectronic distances, MRACPF-r12 [74]. (In fact, since the author of

Ref. [1] was apparently unaware of the revised EA of B, his accuracy for B is better than

claimed in Ref. [1].) Nevertheless, even using this elaborate method, the errors in the O

and F electron aﬃnities obtained in that work [1] are still an order of magnitude larger than

those in the present work. Part of the discrepancy is due to the reliance, for relativistic

corrections, on the numerical Hartree-Fock values of Garc´ıa de la Vega [72], which we have

seen above to be an overestimate for the scalar relativistic contribution.

C. Density functional results

Computed DFT electron aﬃnities are compared with the best nonrelativistic ab initio

values in Table V, while basis set convergence in the DFT results is depicted in Table VI for

two representative DFT functionals, one “pure”, the other hybrid.

As seen in Table VI, basis set convergence for the DFT results is quite rapid. Convergence

is essentially achieved from AVTZ basis sets onwards, and extrapolations of any kind would

add little to the quality of the results. In the remainder of our discussion, we will therefore

employ the unextrapolated results with the largest basis set, AV5Z.

The most striking feature about Table V is that performance with many of the functionals

is qualitatively diﬀerent for ﬁrst-row and second-row atoms. As could be expected, the worst

performance is put in by LDA, with a global mean absolute deviation of 0.377 eV; however,

the results for this functional are substantially better for second-row than for ﬁrst-row atoms,

the performance being almost as good as for the BP86 functional. Upon closer inspection

14

(as exempliﬁed by comparison of the BPW91, B3PW91, and G96PW91 results), it seems

that the results for the ﬁrst row (aside from hydrogen) are quite sensitive to the nature of

the exchange functional, while this is much less the case for the second-row atoms, where the

results are rather dominated by the correlation functional. The performance of many of the

exchange-correlation functionals however for the simplest of systems, i.e. the hydrogen atom,

leaves a lot to be desired. Considering ﬁrst the “pure DFT” (nonhydrid) exchange-correlation

functionals as a group, it appears that the PW91 correlation functional performs somewhat

better than its LYP counterpart, particularly for the second row. For exchange B88 works

somewhat better than PW91 for the ﬁrst row, although there seems to be little to choose

between them for the second row. The 1996 Gill exchange functional however appears to be

markedly superior to both of them, the diﬀerences again being most conspicuous for the ﬁrst

row. Compared to G96LYP, the diﬀerent correlation functional in G96PW91 cuts the error

for the second row in half even as the overall performance for the ﬁrst row is comparable

to that of B3LYP. Overall G96PW91 emerges as the best “pure DFT” functional for the

criterion used here, with a mean absolute error of 0.11 eV for atomic electron aﬃnities (only

0.06 eV in the second row). The contention that the PW91 correlation functional is best

used in conjunction with the PW91 exchange functional does not appear to be borne out by

the present results.

Turning now to the hybrid functionals, we note that the popular B3LYP functional in

fact performs slightly less well than G96PW91. Performance for B3PW91 is in fact markedly

better than that of B3LYP, and the best of all the pre-1996 functionals considered. In line

with the general observation that the ﬁrst-row EAs appear to be much more sensitive to

the exchange part of the functional than their second-row counterparts, the admixture of

Hartree-Fock exchange also has the largest eﬀect for the ﬁrst row.

Interestingly, the 1-parameter B1LYP represents a dramatic improvement over the 3-

parameter B3LYP for ﬁrst-row atoms.

In fact, its performance for the ﬁrst-row electron

aﬃnities is not dissimilar from some of the ab initio calibration studies in the past. Per-

15

formance for the second row is marred by a particularly poor result for Si. LG1LYP yields

marginally better results than B1LYP for the second-row atoms, but slightly worse ones (on

average) for the ﬁrst row. The mPW1LYP functional, on the other hand, exhibits a slight

performance improvement over B1LYP for both ﬁrst-and second-row atoms: residual errors

for the ﬁrst row are down to +0.02 eV (H), +0.05 eV (B), -0.06 eV (C), +0.03 eV (O), and

-0.11 eV (F). Again the weakest performance for the second row is put in for Si (-0.21 eV).

Interestingly enough, substitution of the PW91 correlation functional leads to a serious

deterioration of results for the ﬁrst-row atoms: this is perhaps to some extent related to the

fact that the LYP correlation functional was itself based on a ﬁt [75] to estimated correlation

energies for the ﬁrst-row atoms. The mPW1PW91 functional, on the other hand, yields very

good results for the second-row atoms, with residual errors of -0.10 eV (Al), +0.04 eV (Si),

+0.07 eV (P), -0.01 eV (S), and -0.08 eV (Cl).

The fact that mPW1LYP seems to put in the best performance for the ﬁrst row and

mPW1PW91 for the second row naturally leads to the suggestion that perhaps a hybrid of

the two correlation functionals may lead to the best results overall. If we were to assume

that the Kohn-Sham orbitals do not diﬀer greatly between the mPW1LYP and mPW1PW91

approaches, then the “optimum hybrid” could be determined by minimizing the mean ab-

solute error of a linear combination aEAmPW1LYP + (1 − a)EAmPW1PW91 in terms of a. This

procedure shows some similarity with the “empirical density functionals” recently proposed

by Pople and coworkers [76] As it happens, we ﬁnd the ‘optimum’ value of a to be 0.669,

or almost exactly 2/3. This yields an overall mean absolute error of 0.07 eV, of which 0.05

eV for ﬁrst-row atoms and 0.08 eV for second-row atoms. Individual errors are: H -0.02, B

+0.10, C +0.01, O +0.00, F -0.13, Al -0.04, Si -0.13, P +0.08, S -0.02, and Cl -0.12 eV — in

fact the value for O accidentally agrees with the ab initio value to four ﬁgures. The present

results can be considered as very promising for the accurate calculation of electron aﬃnities

of large molecular systems.

16

IV. CONCLUSIONS

We have carried out ab initio calibration calculations of the electron aﬃnities of the ﬁrst-

and second-row atoms. Our calculations include extrapolations to the inﬁnite-basis limit

as well as corrections for scalar relativistic and spin-orbit eﬀects. Our best ab initio values

agree with the most recent experimental values to within better than 0.001 eV on average.

Neglect of correlation eﬀects beyond CCSD(T) causes an increase in the mean absolute error

by an order of magnitude. Inner-shell correlation is most important for the early second-

row elements, while scalar relativistic eﬀects are quite important for the later second-row

elements. Neglect of electron correlation eﬀects on the scalar relativistic contributions leads

to signiﬁcant overestimates, while inclusion of subvalence correlation is essential for accurate

spin-orbit splitting constants for the second-row elements.

The DFT results are essentially converged with respect to extension of the basis set at

the AVTZ level. The performance of DFT methods for the 1st-row atoms is very strongly

dependendent on the quality of the exchange functional, while this is not the case for second-

row atoms where the correlation functional appears to be rather more important. While the

LYP correlation functional works best for ﬁrst-row atoms, its PW91 counterpart appears to

be preferable for second-row atoms. Among “pure DFT” (nonhybrid) functionals, G96PW91

(Gill 1996 exchange combinated with Perdew-Wang 1991 correlation) puts in the best overall

performance, actually slightly better than the popular hybrid B3LYP functional. B3PW91

outperforms B3LYP, while the recently proposed 1-parameter hybrid functionals such as

B1LYP appear to be clearly superior to B3LYP and B3PW91 for ﬁrst-row atoms. mPW1LYP

puts in the overall best performance for ﬁrst-row atoms, while mPW1PW91 yields the best

results for second-row atoms. The best overall performance appears to be aﬀorded by an

empirical superposition of these functionals, (2/3)mPW1LYP + (1/3)mPW1PW91.

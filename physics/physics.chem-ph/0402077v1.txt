Abstract

Using a representation of multichannel quantum defect theory in terms of a quan-
tum Poincar´e map for bound Rydberg molecules, we apply Jung’s scattering map to
derive a generalized quantum map, that includes the continuum. We show, that this
representation not only simpliﬁes the understanding of the method, but moreover
produces considerable numerical advantages. Finally we show under what circum-
stances the usual semi-classical approximations yield satisfactory results. In partic-
ular we see that singularities that cause problems in semi-classics are irrelevant to
the quantum map.

away from the remaining ionic core. These states form electronic series which
converge towards the ionization limit of the molecule.

−

The starting point of the quantum analysis of such states was the Quantum
Defect Theory (see e.g. the review article by Seaton [1]), established ﬁrst for
atoms. It was shown that, due to the non zero spatial extension of the ionic
core, the levels near the ionization limit follow the hydrogenic Rydberg law
Ry/(n+ d)2, with only a constant (or nearly so) shift d of the principal
En =
quantum number n, entitled Quantum Defect. Quantum Defect Theory was
extended to a Multichannel Quantum Defect Theory (MQDT), for the case
that there are several series which converge to nearby states of the ion, and
interact strongly. It was shown that MQDT gives a uniﬁed theory of bound
states, autoionizing states and electron-ion scattering cross sections. This the-
ory depends only on a small number of parameters, basically one quantum
defect per interacting series. Practically, all is solved with matrices whose size
is the number of series, while “brute force” methods would in principle try
to diagonalize a matrix which contains an inﬁnite number of levels for each
series.

This theory was extended to molecules by Fano [2,3]. There are always many
interacting series corresponding to the rotational states of the ionic core. In-
deed the slow velocity of the core rotation leads to a splitting of the rotational
states of the core which is of the same order of magnitude as the splitting
between high lying electronic Rydberg states. The novelty were the implica-
tions of the anisotropy of the core. The eﬀect of this anisotropy on the ionic
potential decays faster with distance r than the point charge 1/r Coulomb po-
tential, at least as 1/r2 or 1/r3. Fano showed that the key point of the analysis
is the existence of a cut oﬀ distance r0. Below this distance the motion of the
outer electron is tightly bound to the direction of the ionic core, above it the
two become independent. Many detailed studies have followed on moderately
excited Rydberg states of molecules, see e.g. reviews in refs. [4,5].

A novelty resulting from the studies of very high lying states of molecular Ry-
dberg series was the experimental observation of “clear zones” in such inter-
acting series. It was soon understood that this so called “stroboscopic eﬀect”
corresponds to resonances between the period of rotation of the core and the
period of the outer electron orbit [6,7]. In order to study the relationship of
this phenomenon with classical and quantum chaos, the classical limit of the
MQDT theory was established [8]. A Poincar´e surface of section was intro-
duced, whose coordinates correspond to parameters of the molecular system
when the electron leaves the sphere of radius r0. The studies showed that the
“stroboscopic eﬀect” corresponds to a periodic reestablishment of a nearly
integrable phase space structure at each resonance, while the classical phase
space is completely chaotic in between.

The impetus for the present study was given by papers of Bogomolny where he
introduces a semi-classical method for the quantization of a classical Poincar´e
surface of section Map (PM) [9,10,11], and some other follow up papers, e.g.
[12]. The original semi-classical method is not unique and is prone to singular-
ity problems, thereby raising the question about its relationship with a true
quantization. We followed exactly the opposite route, starting from a purely
quantum method (MQDT), establishing its classical limit, and at last studying
Poincar´e surfaces of sections. Our system is ideal for the study of this problem
because we know in advance the correct result. Furthermore our system has an
unusual and non trivial geometry, the phase space being a sphere. For bound
systems, a preliminary report of the interpretation of MQDT as a Quantum
Poincar´e Map (QPM) was provided in ref. [13]. However, the relationship with
the theory of Bogomolny was only a formal analogy of the ﬁnal quantum and
semi-classical formulae used to compute the levels. In this paper we study and
compare step by step classical, semi-classical and quantum descriptions of the
same system.

Another important property of the MQDT is, that it describes bound and
ionized states in a uniﬁed way. Hence, we may use it to study the quantization
of the so called Jung Scattering Map (JSM) for ionized states [14]. Indeed
Jung proposed to send back ionizing trajectories onto the molecule in a well
prescribed way, in order to obtain a of compactiﬁcation of the phase space for
above threshold states. The role of the JSM in this context, has been touched
upon previously to elucidate certain properties of the S-matrix [15]. In the
light of the reinterpretation of MQDT as a QPM for bound systems it seems
very attractive to attempt a comprehensive description, which extends the
advantages outlined in ref. [13] to include both scattering, bound states and
resonances.

The purpose of this paper is to present a classical map which combines the PM
for the part of the phase space corresponding to negative energies of the excited
electron with the JSM for the positive energy region, and then to interpret
MQDT as the quantization of the resulting symplectic map. This will provide
basically two advantages. On one hand a conceptual advantage, as the method
and its approximation can be formulated in the context of a classical map
and its subsequent quantization. In particular, we will see that phase space
representations of wavefunctions for open channels quantize on trajectories of
the JSM in the same way as bound states and ionization resonances quantize
on trajectories of the PM. On the other hand on a more practical level, the
dynamics is shown to be semi-separable [12,16] which permits a decomposition
into separable steps, and suggests to choose a surface of section such that it
separates these steps. Consequently, the QPM for half an evolution step of the
system contains the relevant information, and its diagonalization will permit
to ﬁnd eigenvalues, eigenvectors, the level dynamics, etc in a simpliﬁed way.
This will be particularly useful when dealing with near degenerate levels or

3

resonances which occur frequently and cause considerable diﬃculties in the
conventional approach [13,17].

In the next section we shall develop the generalized classical PM, which in-
cludes the JSM for the particular conditions of a Rydberg molecule. In the
third section we shall present the main result of this paper. MQDT for bound
states and open systems will be formulated as a generalized QPM. In both
these sections attention will be given to relaxing the common approxima-
tion to keep the absolute value of the electron angular momentum ﬁxed. In
section four we shall discuss applications and show numerical examples that
demonstrate the practical advantages of this method and may also give some
new insight in situations of quantum chaotic scattering. These examples will
exclusively be given within the approximation of ﬁxed absolute value of the
electron angular momentum, mainly to show nice two dimensional plots of
surfaces of section. As the QPM was originally proposed in a semi-classical
approximation [9,10,11], we shall in section 5 compare the approximate results
of semi-classics to the ones of the ”exact” QPM. We shall see that singularities
causing problems in semi-classics are absent in the QPM. Therefore the QPM
can be used to test regularization procedures for semi-classics.

2 Generalized classical Poincar´e map for Rydberg molecules

2.1 Principle

−

A Rydberg molecule is composed of an ionic positively charged molecular
core and an outer electron. It is speciﬁcally given the name “Rydberg” when
one considers states just below or above the ionization threshold, where the
outer electron performs large excursions far away from the core. This situa-
tion allows to deﬁne a distance r0 which separates the potential felt by the
outer electron into a long range Coulomb part, and a short range or collision
part. In the long range part, the outer electron only feels the spherically sym-
1/r Coulomb potential of the core (we use throughout the “atomic
metric
units” (a.u.) e = ~ = m = 1). Its motion is comparatively slow because one
considers states near the ionization limit, but it can be either bound or un-
bound. The electron moves along a Kepler orbit whose plane and axis are ﬁxed
in the laboratory frame. Meanwhile, the ionic core rotates freely around its
angular momentum N. In the collision area the electron feels the lower sym-
1/r2) or
metry, faster decreasing, part of the potential of the core (dipolar (
1/r3) for a diatomic molecule) and it is strongly accelerated.
quadrupolar (
This strong acceleration leads to a short range collision motion, which is ap-
proximately the same for a total energy slightly below or above the ionization
threshold, since the diﬀerence between the corresponding velocities is negligi-

Fig. 1.
(a) The outer electron follows a Kepler orbit, ﬁxed in space, for large
distances r > r0 and changes the Kepler orbit for r < r0 by interaction with the
short range part of the ionic core potential. (b) When the electron ionizes the Jung’s
recipe is to feed back the electron which escapes to inﬁnity by doing a step backwards
in time without collision with the core (i.e. a pure Kepler hyperbola with reverted
velocity), and then re launch the electron towards the molecule along the resulting
asymptotic trajectory for the next collision.

ble compared to the velocity produced by the acceleration. This is basically
the reason why in quantum mechanics MQDT treats bound and unbound
states in a uniﬁed way. During the collision there is exchange both of angular
momentum and energy between the electron and the core. The exchange of
angular momentum implies a change of the plane of the Kepler orbit, since the
angular momentum of the electron L is perpendicular to its plane (Fig. 1(a)).
The exchange of energy leads to a variation of the eccentricity of the orbit,
and may turn it into an ionizing trajectory. In this case the Jung’s recipe [14]
is to feed back the electron which escapes to inﬁnity by doing a step back-
wards in time without collision with the core (i.e. a pure Coulomb step with
reverted velocity), and then re launch the electron towards the molecule along
the resulting asymptotic trajectory (Fig. 1(b)). By doing this, one obtains
trajectories which cross inﬁnitely many times the r = r0 sphere. Poincar´e sur-
faces of section are described by a set of parameters of the molecular system
at those instants where the electron crosses outwards the sphere. To deﬁne
these parameters (several sets are possible) we ﬁrst need to deﬁne precisely
the reference frames and count the number of independent parameters for the
determination of the dimension of this Poincar´e surface of section.

2.2 Reference frames

In this work, we will use three reference frames, the laboratory frame and
two molecular reference frames, entitled “quantum” and “classical” reference
frames. They are shown in Fig. 2.

frame. Obtained from the laboratory frame with a rotation of Euler angles ϕM , θM ,

frame. It is obtained from the “quantum” by a rotation around ˆM which brings the
OXC axis along the angular momentum N of the core. This frame is physically the
most signiﬁcant, and all other ﬁgures of this paper are drawn with this convention.

(a) Laboratory frame. Due to the global rotational invariance which entails
conservation of the total angular momentum J, we can select, without
loss of generality, its Oz axis along the total angular momentum J. The
other two axis are arbitrary (but ﬁxed). In this frame the axis ˆM of the
core has (varying) polar angles θM and φM .

(b) “Quantum” molecular reference frame. It is obtained by a rotation of the
laboratory frame by the Euler angles θM , ϕM , 0 (as common in quantum
mechanics [18] we use the y convention for the Euler angles [19, Appendix
B]). We entitled it “quantum” because it is the frame used in the quan-
tum theory of molecules. The third Euler angle is arbitrary for a diatomic
molecule, and is sometimes selected as π/2 [20] for normalization reasons,
which do not concern us here. Therefore, we prefer to stick to the con-
ventions of the ﬁrst paper by Fano [2]. We restrict to the diatomic case
for simplicity, a third Euler angle would be necessary for a polyatomic
core. In this frame J lies in the “vertical” plane OXQYQ. The angular
momentum of the core N for a diatomic molecule is perpendicular to the
core axis ˆM, because the moment of inertia of the core around it is zero.
It is thus in the “horizontal” plane OXQYQ.

(c) “Classical” molecular reference frame. This frame is obtained from the
“quantum” frame by a rotation around OZQ = OZC such that the new
OXC axis is along N. As will become obvious below, from the physical
point of view this frame is the most appropriate for the visualization of
the results. As in previous publications [8,13,15,17,21] we will use it in
all ﬁgures of this paper.

Formulas to go from one reference frame to the others are obtained from simple
geometric arguments based on the previous remarks, and are established in
Appendix A.

2.3 Count of parameters and the dimension of the Poincar´e surface of section

The conﬁguration space is described by ﬁve coordinates in the laboratory
frame. Two angles θM , ϕM describe the position of the axis of the diatomic
ionic core (a third would be necessary for a polyatomic core). Two angles
θe, ϕe and a radial distance r describe the position of the electron. Thus con-
ﬁguration space has a dimension of ﬁve and phase space has a dimension of
ten. Conservation of the total angular momentum J reduces the dimension of
phase space by 4, two for the Poisson commuting actions Jz and J 2, and two
for the associated angles. The ﬁrst angle can be selected as the polar angle
ϕJ associated with Jz, that is the angle of the projection of J onto the lab-
oratory plane Oxy, which is constant (with our choice of the laboratory axis
it is in fact undetermined but this is of no importance). The second can be
a global rotation angle around J associated to J 2, which is cyclic (but not

7

action
constant): see e.g. the analogous reduction to the
angle system for the pure Kepler problem in [19, Chap. 10-7]. Consequently,
the dimension of the reduced phase space in the general case is six, and a
Poincar´e surface of section has dimension four.

{

The introduction of the auxiliary approximation that the modulus L of the
angular momentum L of the electron is conserved during the collision re-
duces the dimension of the phase space by two (L2 and the associated angle),
and thus the Poincar´e surface of section has dimension two, which enables
graphical representations. This approximation was used in our previous works
[8,13,15,17,21], and is valid in the experimental works which motivated the
theoretical study [6,7]. The reason for its validity is that the splitting between
diﬀerent electronic L2 levels produced by the spherically symmetric part of the
potential of the core is much larger than the splitting between sub levels of
L2, produced by its anisotropic part. In the experiments, L takes low values,
restricted to 0. . . 2 by a two steps laser excitation. Here, however we want to
study the semi classical limit, where the angular momenta take large values.
There are two possibilties to increase angular momenta. First we can increase
them without changing other molecular parameters. This is experimentally
possible since the application of R.F. ﬁelds [22] or of combined electric and
magnetic ﬁelds [23] in atomic Rydberg states enable to climb the L ladder
up to circular orbits. In this case the constant L approximation breaks down
for higher L. A study of the consequences for this case has been performed in
ref. [24]. However, this is not what we aim at, since it implies a complete change
of the physics of the problem at hand. We want to gain insight into the physics
of the experimental works in refs. [6,7], by establishing its semi-classical limit.
Mathematically this amounts to letting ~
0 while keeping all classical pa-
rameters constant. Practically, since ~ is a constant of nature (taken as 1 in
atomic units), this requires the increase of all classical parameters while keep-
ing constant their dimensionless ratios. For example, decreasing ~ by a factor
of m implies to multiplication of all momenta by m, angular L, J, N, and
principal, n. The Kepler period Te of the orbital motion of the electron, which
is proportional to n3 is thus multiplied by m3, the period TN of the rotational
motion of the core which is proportional to I/N (where I is the moment of
inertia of the core) must be multiplied by the same factor, so that I scales as
m4. Similarly, one must scale the ratio between the geometric size of the core
and the De Broglie wavelength, keeping constant the core’s shape parameters
(ratio anisotropic / isotropic). This maintains constant the ratio of the clas-
sical periods associated with L, due to the isotropic part of the short range
ˆM, due to the torque produced by the anisotropic
potential, and with Λ = L
part of this short range potential. This maintains the validity of the approx-
imation of constant L. Of course this needs proportionally larger molecules,
more diﬃcult experimentally to deal with, but not completely out of reach
since recent experimental studies have found Rydberg states on molecules as
large as Benzene Argon complexes [25], Diazacyclooctane (DABCO) and bis

→

(benzene) chromium (BBC) [26].

Thus, for practical reasons, we shall continue to use the constant L approxi-
mation in many formulae and all pictures presented in this article. Yet we shall
show, especially in the present and the next sections, that these restrictions
are not essential for the interpretation of MQDT as a QPM, and how formulae
can be generalized.

Finally notice that in ref. [21], we started with only seven parameters. The
three missing parameters were the three angles associated to the three con-
served momenta J 2, Jz and L2. This is legitimate in classical mechanics since
they can be computed afterwards by a mere quadrature. For the compari-
son between classical and quantum mechanics, which is the main purpose of
this work, this is natural since these angles are totally undetermined due to
Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle for well deﬁned values of the corresponding
momenta.

2.4 Parameterizations of the Poincar´e surface of section

We ﬁrst discuss the case of constant L. For a proper parameterization of a
two dimensional Poincar´e surface of section, we need two conjugated param-
eters, a momentum and an angle. We will not use the most obvious angles
θe, ϕe of the electron and their conjugated momenta, but angles associated
with angular momenta LZQ of the electron and N of the core because in the
quantum MQDT description of the molecule, these momenta enter naturally
as (approximate) quantum numbers for the limiting cases [2]. There are diﬀer-
ent choices, depending on whether we work in the molecular or the laboratory
frame.

(1) “Quantum” molecular frame. We use the projection Λ = LZQ = L

ˆM
of the electron angular momentum onto the core axis, and the angle
ϕQ
L , the azimuthal angle of the projection of L into the horizontal plane
OXQYQ, conjugated like the j1, w1 pair in [19, eq. 10-139]. This choice
of parameters implies that the Poincar´e surface of section is a sphere
on which every point is deﬁned by θQ
L , i.e. the
direction of L in the molecular frame.

L = arccos(Λ/L) and ϕQ

·

(2) Laboratory frame. We use the modulus N of the angular momentum of
the core (not one of its projection onto laboratory frame). Intuitively,
the associated angle is the angle of rotation ϕN of the molecular core ˆM
around the direction of N, and the only possible reference for this angle is
given by the direction of the total angular momentum J. A proof of this
intuition, namely a precise deﬁnition of this angle, formulae relating the
pairs
, and the proof that this transformation

and

is canonical is given in Appendix A.1.

(3) “Classical” molecular frame. We use LZC = LZQ (the two Z axis coincide),
and ϕC
L , the angle referred to N in the “horizontal” plane (Fig. 2(c)). No-
tice that this pair is not conjugated, as discussed in section 5.1. The
consequence is that the Poincar´e map does not conserve the area of the
sphere with these coordinates, a small eﬀect for the choice of parameters
we have used in this paper. We stick nevertheless to this choice for graph-
ical representations, because it gives more intuitive physical pictures as
shown below.

Notice that with this choice of parameters, the direction of the plane of the
Kepler orbit is well determined in the molecular frame, since it is perpendicular
to L, and its eccentricity is well determined by L and the electron energy Ee,
but that the direction of its main axis in this plane, i.e. the Laplace-Runge-
Lenz vector A [19], is not. As explained in ref. [8], the reason for this is that
no component of A , which deﬁnes this major axis, commutes with L2 which
is kept ﬁxed. Our counting of parameters implies that the direction of A is
not an independent parameter.

Introducing the approximation that L is a constant has as a consequence that
the information about the main axis direction is hidden in the angle associated
to L2. Then, the choice of action angle variables corresponds to that typically
used in the pure bound Kepler problem in celestial mechanics [19]. The actions
are j1 = Lz, j2 = L and j3 =
1/2Ee (i.e. “principal quantum number”).
The associated angles are the “longitude of the ascending node” Ω (= ϕL+π/2
with our notations), the “argument of the perihelion” ω, which is the direction
of the main axis in the orbital plane (or the direction of A in this plane) we are
looking for, and the “mean anomaly” which is proportional to time. Thus, the
angle of the main axis of the ellipse, which is constant for pure Kepler motion,
i.e. for Rydberg molecules when the electron is far away from the core, but
varies during the collision, is part of the map only, if the approximation L2
constant is omitted.

2.5 Description of the classical Poincar´e map

We now brieﬂy describe the PM, both in the laboratory and in the molecular
frame. The dynamics is composed of two independent consecutive steps:

(i) collision step: when r

r0 the electron feels the short range anisotropic
part of the potential. We suppose that this step is very short, so that the
core axis remains ﬁxed (impulse approximation). It is thus best described
in the molecular frame. Due to the cylindrical symmetry of this potential
ˆM of L onto the core axis ˆM is conserved. With
the projection Λ = L

≪

π

−

the auxiliary approximation that L2 is constant, this amounts to the
collision being described by a precession of L around ˆM by an angle
δϕL. Furthermore the invariance of the potential under reﬂection with
respect to any plane containing ˆM implies that δϕL is odd with respect
θL. The simplest choice is δϕL = K cos θL, which deﬁnes
to θL →
the strength K of the interaction. Notice that this θL dependant rotation
about the OZ molecular axis is a twist, not a global rotation of the sphere,
implying that the dynamics generated by the map can be chaotic [27,28].
Since L has changed, at least in direction if we make the approximation
L2 constant, due to the the conservation of total angular momentum
J = L + N, N changes both in direction and in magnitude. This has far
reaching consequences. The change of the magnitude entails a change of
the rotational energy of the core EN = BN 2 (2B is the reciprocal of the
core moment of inertia I according to usual spectroscopic notation [29]).
Consequently, due to the conservation of the total energy E the electron’s
energy Ee = E
EN also changes. If Ee becomes positive the molecule
ionizes, if it remains negative the resulting changes of Te and TN will
change the parameters of the next Coulomb step. While the “quantum”
molecular reference frame is ﬁxed during the collision, in the “classical”
molecular reference frame, its OXC axis, which is chosen along N, will
change (Fig. 2(c)). This produces an additional phaseshift δϕ′
L, which
was called frame recoil in ref. [8] where explicit formulae are given. It
can also be computed from eq. (A.3) of Appendix A.1, which gives the
angular position of N in the ﬁxed “quantum” molecular frame, by taking
the diﬀerence of positions before and after the δϕL kick.

−

(ii) Coulomb (or free rotation) step: when r

r0 the electron only feels
1/r part of the potential. It moves on a Ke-
the spherically symmetric
pler orbit. Its angular momentum L and its Laplace-Runge-Lenz vector
A are constant in the laboratory Oxyz reference frame. Meanwhile the
molecular core rotates at constant speed around its angular momentum
N which is perpendicular to its axis ˆM. When seen in the “classical”
molecular frame, with OZ along ˆM and OXC along N (Fig. 2(c)), L
(and A) seem to rotate the opposite way (clockwise) around OXC. The
2πTe/TN , i.e. the ratio of the periods of
total angle of rotation is δβ =

2Ee)3/2
the electron orbit and of the core rotation. We have Te = 2π(
a.u. and TN = 2π/2BN a.u..

−

The crucial point of this model is the exchange of energy between the electron
and the core during the collision step. If we neglected it the model would coin-
cide with with a “kicked spin” model [30,31], which cannot lead to ionization.

For the free rotation step we prefer to visualize the results in the “classical”
molecular frame. Indeed in the “quantum” molecular frame the free rotation
is about a direction of N in the molecular OXQYQ plane (see Fig. 2(b)), which
varies from step to step. We will visualize ionization on the Poincar´e sphere in

11

the “classical” frame by noting that positive electron energies Ee correspond
to points where the total energy E is greater than the rotational energy EN .
Using J2 = (L + N)2, this leads to the inequality

(cid:19)

This condition only depends on the angle α between L and N and accordingly
the positive electron energy region corresponds to a cap around the positive
N axis, which is ﬁxed in this frame (Fig. 2(c)). If we relax the condition L2
constant, we have a four dimensional PM and formulae for the collision and
the recoil are modiﬁed, but eq. (1) remains valid.

Practically, there are two possibilities to compute the classical PM. In all our
previous works, we considered it entirely in the “classical” molecular reference
frame, by computing in turn free rotation, collision δϕL, frame recoil, new
values of N, EN , TN , Ee, Te and plotting the results in the “classical” reference
frame by using equations given in Appendix A.1. In the present work we
alternate between laboratory frame and “quantum” reference frame, in a way
summarized in the ﬁrst three columns of table 1 (the last two will be ﬁlled
below in sections 3 and 5). We choose this more complex, and thus slower,
procedure, because as outlined in section 5, the coordinates in the “classical”
reference frame are not canonically conjugate. This is of no harm for purely
classical computations, but forbids the semi-classical analysis. Of course we
have checked that both representations give the same results.

Finally we will describe how to construct the combined Poincar´e–Jung scatter-
ing map. The JSM is deﬁned such that the electron which escapes to inﬁnity
is fed back by doing a step backwards in time without collision with the core
(i.e. a pure Coulomb step with reverted velocity), and then re launching the
electron towards the molecule along the resulting asymptotic trajectory for
the next collision (Fig. 1(b)). Notice that L and A are constant in the lab-
oratory frame during such a pure Coulomb step. For the L2 constant case
this amounts to starting from the same point on the Poincar´e sphere in the
molecular frame if Ee > 0 after a collision, i.e. to skip the three ﬁrst steps
in Table 1. Indeed the rotation of the core is neglected during the impulse
collision step, and during journeys to and from inﬁnity of the electron these
rotations cancel since they are made for r > r0, where the short range poten-
tial is negligible. In the general case the “argument of the perihelion” ω is also
conserved. The proper JSM is a map from ionized to ionized states, the PM
a map from bound to bound states, but there is obviously no technical prob-
lem to iterate a combined map from unbound to bound states and vice versa
by selecting the JSM recipe to feed back ionizing trajectories. This seemingly
strange feed back was suggested and discussed in ref. [14]. We shall show that
it is indeed a good representation of the results in quantum mechanics under
semi-classical conditions.

3 MQDT as a generalized quantum Poincar´e map

3.1 The usual MQDT theory

MQDT for molecules is a well established, time honored theory [2,3,4,5]. We
will outline here only what is needed for our purposes. The theory closely
parallels the preceding classical ideas, which originated from the classical limit
of MQDT, but which were implicitly present in Fano’s seminal paper [2], albeit
with a fully quantum way of writing down the theory. Wave functions have
diﬀerent forms for r . r0 and r & r0 and they are matched at r = r0. Going
from r = 0 to r =

we have

∞

(i) Collision step: r . r0. The electron’s motion is rigidly coupled to the
molecular axis ˆM. Its speed exceeds by far the speed of the motions
of the nuclei of the molecular ion and the Born-Oppenheimer factoriza-
tion of the molecular wave function applies (Hund’s case (b) coupling
type according to molecular spectroscopy nomenclature[29]). Due to the
ˆM of the
cylindrical symmetry of the potential the projection Λ = L
electron’s angular momentum onto the molecular axis ˆM is a constant of
the motion, whereas the squared angular momentum N2 of the molecular
ion rotation does not have a deﬁnite value. We may or may not have a
deﬁnite value of L2 depending on the use of the auxiliary approximation

L2 = const. The angular part of the wave function is thus an eigen-

function of Λ (in addition to J and MJ ) denoted by X (J,Λ)
[2], where (θ′
e) are the angular coordinates of the Rydberg electron in
the “quantum” molecular reference frame OXQYQZQ deﬁned in Fig. 2(b)
and Appendix A. For r
r0, i.e. outside of the molecular core, where
the potential is approximately pure Coulomb, the radial part of the Ry-
dberg electron wave function is a linear combination of two independent
Coulomb functions. We choose the one regular at r = 0, s(Ee, r), as well
as one irregular at r = 0, c(Ee, r), suitably selected for its asymptotic
properties when r
[1]. The normalized total wave function reads [2]
as

(2)
This implicitely deﬁnes the “quantum defects” µΛ. Notice that Ee de-
pends on Λ. If the subsidiary approximation L2 constant is not used, the
X’s are not eigenstates of L2, but can be developed in such a basis, im-
plying a summation over L and an extra label L on the µ’s and the Ee’s.
The quantum defects can in principle be computed by ab initio electronic
molecular calculations between r = 0 and r = r0, but we will take them
here as semi empirical parameters, as is frequently done. We will assume
that they are independent of energy, in a restricted range above or below
zero electron energy. This is justiﬁed by the fact that in the inner region
the change of the total energy is negligible as compared to the electron
kinetic energy in the Coulomb well. The wave function in the collision
region should not depend signiﬁcantly on such small variations of the
total energy. For large distances there is a diﬀerence, leading to bound
or unbound states. We will neglect reﬁnements used in actual molecular
calculations to compute levels with somewhat lower principal quantum
numbers, for which one allows quantum defects to vary slowly with Ee.
(ii) Coulomb step: r & r0. The electron is coupled to the isotropic part of the
Coulomb potential only, and cannot exchange angular momentum with
the core. The core angular momentum N and the electron angular mo-
mentum L are thus separately conserved, as is J = L + N. The angular
(θe, ϕe, ˆM) corresponds to the coupling
part of the wave function Φ(L,J,N )
by a Clebsch-Gordan coeﬃcient of an electron wave function labeled by L
and of a molecular core wave function labeled by N (Hund’s case (d) cou-
pling type according to molecular spectroscopy nomenclature[29]). Here
(θe, ϕe) are the electron coordinates in the laboratory reference frame
Oxyz. The radial part of the wave function of the Rydberg electron is
again a linear combination of regular and irregular Coulomb wave func-
tions. The total wave function reads

MJ

ΨN (θe, ϕe, ˆM; r) = Φ(L,J,N )

For r

In a closed channel, for the motion to be bounded, the exponentially increasing
part of the Coulomb wave function must be zero, which implies that the radial

Comparing this result with the equation for the T (En) matrix deﬁned by
Bogomolny [9,10,11] was essential for the interpretation of MQDT as a QPM
in ref. [13]. We will examine this relation more closely in the next sections.

For scattering systems we have to go a little further, because we have to search
for the phase shifts at any energy rather than for eigenvalues and eigenfunc-
tions. For this situation we shall derive another useful form of these equations.
Remember that in this case vectors and matrices in eqs. (24,25) depend on the
channel number ℓ and that the BN (ℓ) are identical to the eigenvectors TN ℓ of
the S matrix. We are looking for a set of equations written for open channels
only, whereas eq. (24) is written for all channels, open and closed. For this
purpose we write eq. (25) in bloc diagonal form, splitting the N channels into
open channels indexed by o and closed channels indexed by c. This is possible
for elements indexed by the asymptotic quantum number N, e.g. ˆ
ˆ
t, not for

3.3 Computational advantages

The usual MQDT (sec. 3.1) uses the equation det ˆ
= 0 (eq. 16) which can be
S
rewritten as a polynomial in tan(πτℓ) whose degree equals the number of open
channels. Each root gives a well deﬁned τ because, according to eq. (11), the
eigenphases of the ˆS matrix can take values between 0 and 1 (or -0.5 and 0.5)
only. Depending on the choice of the total energy there are the possibilities
that all channels are closed (there is then only one value of the set
) or
open. In the last case one obtains as obvious solutions the values τℓ = µΛ (see
(eq. 16). This shows that the µΛ are exactly the usual collision phase shifts
when the energy is high enough for all channels to be open. In the general case
equation ( 16) is not solved by a diagonalization algorithm. The usual way to
ﬁnd a solution is

AΛ}

{

•

All channels closed: No τℓ. All matrix elements depend on energy E through
the νN . One varies E and locates the zeros of the determinant by a root
searching algorithm.

19

•

Some channels closed, some open. One ﬁxes a given value of E and searches
the values of τℓ for which the determinant vanishes. The search may be done
by computing the determinant and varying τℓ like in the preceding case, or
by writing the polynomial in tan τℓ and computing its roots. In any case it
is a root searching algorithm.

As explained in ref. [13], where illuminating ﬁgures are given, the practical
problem with such a standard approach is that when zeros are very close
the determinant crosses twice or more often the zero line at extremely close
values, and nearly tangent to the zero line. This makes it very diﬃcult to
avoid the missing of some pairs of zeroes. Moreover, in such a situation it is
very diﬃcult to recover the wavefunctions individually as they switch between
nearly orthogonal states for a very small change of E or τℓ. This situation
is quite common in the case of a nearly integrable phase space, where there
are systematic near degeneracies associated to the lack of level repulsion due
to approximately conserved quantum numbers. The problem of missing levels
becomes particularly severe for the high values of angular momenta we use to
study the semi classical limit.

In our QPM formulation (sec. 3.2) for bound systems the relevant practical
aspect [13] was that we could diagonalize the unitary matrix ˆ
by standard
E
techniques. Then the equation is solved by a search of zeros of the eigenphases,
which move monotonously as a function of energy. Though it still requires a
root searching algorithm, it is much more eﬃcient for near degenerate lev-
els than the standard MQDT equation det ˆ
= 0 and may be accelerated
S
by linear interpolation. In the case of approximate double degeneracies, the
diagonalization algorithm always reliably provides a good pair of orthogonal
wavefunctions.

t ˆ
E

Similarly in the ionized case the computation of the S matrix with eqs. (33,34)
is reduced to a standard diagonalization of a complex symmetric matrix (for
any real energy), with an auxiliary inversion of a matrix in the closed channel
space. The components of the resulting wave function on the open channels
(Bo(ℓ)
Toℓ) are obtained by the diagonalization and the components on
the closed channels are then deduced with eq. (28). An other way to use this
equation is to look for the zeros of the matrix to invert in the complex energy
plane, which gives poles of the ˆS matrix. We will use both techniques in the
next sections.

4 Comparison between classical and quantum evolution on the sur-

face of section

4.1 Principles

One of the basic tools we use to study properties of our molecular system is to
compare the PM with Husimi [33] or Wigner [34] plots of eigenfunctions, as
well as the time evolution of such quantum distributions in phase space with
that of a swarm of classical trajectories. In such plots we represent the angular
part of the wave function, ignoring its radial part. In other words we represent
both the classical and the quantum evolution on the surface of section, thus
relating the PM and the QPM.

First we recall that we can perform the comparison of such objects in two
diﬀerent frames, the molecular or Born-Oppenheimer frame and the labora-
tory frame. The molecular frame wave functions have coeﬃcients labeled by
Λ, the laboratory frame wave functions have coeﬃcients labeled by N. The
coeﬃcients of a given wave function in those two reference frames are related
by eq. (22). According to eq. (17) the matrix ˆ
which performs the transfor-
C
mation is composed of the matrix ˆU , which transforms between the molecular
and the laboratory frames and of phase shifts in the two frames. We will ex-
plain the meaning of these phase shifts at the end of this section. Note that,
according to [35, eq. (A2.1)], the asymptotic value of ˆU for large angular mo-
menta reduces to a rotation of π/2 around OY . ˆU thus basically performs a
rotation between two orthogonal polar axis ˆM and N. We shall focus on four
key points in an electron orbit: perigee, apogee, and the two crossings of the
surface of the sphere of radius r0, the border between the free motion and the
collision region. For hyperbolic motion the apogee does not exist. Wave func-
tions for all these four points are naturally contained in the MQDT. Perigee
coeﬃcients are the AΛ introduced in eq. (6). They are naturally expressed in
the laboratory frame. In the case where all channels are bound, apogee co-
t introduced in
eﬃcients are the components BN of the eigenvector
eqs. (21,22). They are naturally expressed in the laboratory frame, but may
be expressed in the molecular frame by multiplication with the matrix ˆU t. The
coeﬃcients at the crossing of the sphere of radius r0 before and after collision
are the angular parts of incoming ϕ−(r) and outgoing ϕ+(r) in eq. (10). They
are deﬁned for unbound motion, but the basis for the validity of MQDT is that
at r0 the inner part of the wave function is approximately the same for bound
and unbound motion. So even for bound motion one can speak of “inﬁnitely
far from the core” motion at r0. This was a key point for the derivation of the
classical limit of MQDT in ref. [8]. The incoming and outgoing angular parts
are naturally deﬁned in the laboratory frame, but inserting eq. (9) into eq. (6)
we see that they are respectively eiπ ˆµAΛ and e−iπ ˆµAΛ in the molecular frame.

As written this is the determinant of a matrix in the molecular frame. It rep-
resents a QPM between perigee and perigee, and the associated eigenfunctions
are the
. These are the angular part of the perigee wave function. They
depend on the energy E and (if there are open channels) on the phase shift
τℓ which cause the determinant to vanish. The second line of this equation
reads, from right to left: apply half a collision (eiπ ˆµ), rotate the axis from OZ
to OX by ˆU , apply half a free rotation (eiπˆν), you are at the apogee. Then
apply half a free rotation, rotate from OX to OZ, apply half a collision and
you are back to the perigee.

One may cyclically interchange the matrices in the product entering the de-
terminant. Then eigenfunctions of the associated matrix are transformed ac-
cordingly. Moving the matrices step by step one place from left to right this
gives ﬁrst the QPM for the outgoing wave,
in the molecular frame,
then the same QPM in the laboratory frame, next the QPM between apogee
and apogee in the laboratory frame etc. This provides the explanation for the
phase shifts included in eq. (22): going from AΛ to BN involves not only a
change of the basis, but also half a collision, and half a free rotation.

4.2 All channels closed

That this is the correct interpretation is illustrated in Fig. 3, where we com-
pare the time evolution of a (quantum mechanical) Husimi distribution and
a corresponding classical swarm of trajectories for a bound system. The pa-
rameters correspond to a mean energy for which Te/TN = 1/3, so that a
free rotation is 1/3 of a turn, and a strong coupling K =
3.98765 π giving a
−
OZ poles (and zero
strong stretch around OZ, nearly
two full turns at the
±
at the equator). The remaining parameters are chosen as L = 40, J = 200,
2B = 2.5 10−12 a.u.. The angular momenta are large as compared to those
accessible in current molecular experiments, especially L which usually is lim-
ited to the range 0-2 in two step laser excitations. They correspond to semi
classical scaling of the experimental situation [6,7], as explained in section 2.3.

is then expanded in this eigenbasis. The time evolution results by applying
exp(iEit) to the Ai
Λ. Notice that it is applied only to the angular part, not to
the radial part of the wave functions. But for integer times, which correspond
to a full orbit because we express energies in terms of a mean ν, the radial
part is the same, so the corresponding radial overlap is one. This procedure
is consistent with the QPM point of view. What we neglect in doing so, is
the spreading with time of the radial wave packet. This is consistent with
a semi classical picture. For a full quantum computation we would need to
choose a radial distribution f (r) peaked around the corresponding radius r,
perigee, apogee, r0, and to develop this initial state, angular and radial part,
in an eigenbasis. The initial quantum distribution is the Husimi distribution
state. The corresponding classical distribution is a circle around OZ
of a
with radius given by cos θL = L/
L(L + 1). In Fig. 3 the top pair (a) equally
corresponds to incoming, perigee and outgoing waves because the collision is
a rotation around OZ and the distribution is rotationally invariant around
this axis. The next pair (b) is the apogee. Quantum mechanically we cannot
compute it from the previous distribution because we can compute only the
evolution with an integral number of turns. It is thus obtained by a rotation
of the initial distribution around OX by 1/6 of a turn. But then everything
is computed from the four initial distributions by applying the above method.

One sees perfectly the evolution: 1/6 of a turn around OX (c), half stretch
around OZ (d), half stretch along OZ (e), 1/6 of a turn around OX (f) etc.
The quantum distribution follows perfectly the classical one in such short
times. For longer times they begin to diﬀer due to the ﬁnite value of ~.

4.3 First Channel Open

YYYYYYYYY

Fig. 4. First channel opening. Classical PM. Since Poincar´e maps have a symmetry
C2 around OX, only half the sphere is needed. We use a stereographic projection
from +OZ of the lower part of the sphere. The open part is a small cap near the
+OX axis. Large black squares at its border are ionizing trajectories.

To begin with, we select an energy just above the ﬁrst threshold. As for the
rest of this section we select L = 50, J = 100, 2B = 10−10 a.u., so N varies
between 50 and 150. As compared to the bound case, the ratio L/J has been
increased from 1/5 to 1/2 to increase the transfer of energy between electron
and core. The PM is given in Fig. 4. The ionization region corresponds to a
very small white cap around the +OX axis. The large black squares at its
border are the points of ionization of some trajectories.

The value of the phase shift τ of the S matrix as a function of energy is shown
in Fig. 5: for each energy there is only one open channel, thus one value of τ .

The Husimi plot of the wave function at the ﬁrst channel opening (see Fig. 6(a))
is located in the open part of the sphere. Resonances for nearly bound states
appear as increments of τ by one. The widths of the resonances vary widely.
The physical reason for this is easily displayed by Husimi plots for the reso-
nances observed in Fig. 5. The very broad resonance which spans all of Fig. 5
is seen to be localized in the chaotic region, overlapping widely with the open
part of the sphere: Fig. 6(b). We see three other resonances of decreasing

part, as shown in Fig. 6(c)-(e). Note that these resonances live on the border
of an integrable island, and are thus of similar type as states computed in
ref. [36]. The state 6(f) is even narrower as it lives on or around an integrable
island within this chaotic zone. It is seen as a one point glitch in Fig. 5. In
addition there are much narrower resonances which cannot be found easily
by the previous method. They are localized on or beyond the large regular
region in the middle of the sphere, and have exceedingly small width, due to
an exponentially small overlap of the Husimi function with the open part of
the sphere.

Using the traditional method which looks for a zero value of a determinant we
have been able to locate them by the following trick. We can set artiﬁcially
a lower than zero threshold for ionization both in classical and in quantum
mechanics: this would correspond to the existence of a long range screening
potential, which might be due to stray electric ﬁelds or a space charge. In
the classical simulation, this corresponds to considering an electron which
after collision has an electronic energy higher than a given negative threshold
Ethresh as ionized and not returning. In quantum mechanics, since the only
diﬀerence between open and closed channels is the replacement of νN by
τ ,
this corresponds to performing this replacement for a ﬁnite value of νN , which
corresponds to this Ethresh. We have selected such a case: see the negative
energy for opening of the ﬁrst channel in Fig. 5. If we do not apply this trick,
the whole sphere is closed for the same value of the parameters. We can thus

use MQDT for closed channels to compute energies and eigenfunctions of all
channels. We select by inspection the wave functions quantized in the regular
regions and run the open channel MQDT with a very small step to locate the
resonances. Thus, we have been able to locate resonances of widths 2 10−21 and
1.5 10−29 a.u. located respectively in the regular regions near the equator and
the bottom of the sphere, and also a resonance of intermediate width 1 10−27

we have checked that the Husimi plots for the closed level and the resonance

But this situation is quite unsatisfactory in the general case of truly posi-
tive energy, where we cannot use this trick to locate such narrow resonances.
Fortunately the method of locating the poles of the ˆS matrix in the complex
plane indicated at the end of section 3 is much more powerful. We can use
the contour integration to locate the resonances by dichotomy in the complex
plane, and ﬁnally use a root searching algorithm to compute them accurately
once they have been approximately located. To check this method we have

the system is in the bound chaotic part it diﬀuses slowly towards the back
or the front of the sphere. This diﬀusion mechanism was studied carefully in
ref. [21]. When it ionizes, the JSM generates a set of one bounce events, tracing
a semi circle around OZ in the open region, until it enters the bound region
at the end of the semi circle and starts anew to diﬀuse. Due to the small value
of µ the number of steps needed to complete the semi circle is very large. The
trajectory thus behaves like one injected very close to a parabolic manifold.

Quantum mechanically Fig. 8 displays the phase shifts for the eigenchannels.
There are 23 channels open at this energy. We readily see that it displays a
set of resonances.

Some Husimi plots of the eigenfunctions of the open channels are displayed in
Fig. 9(a-c). They follow closely the trajectories of the JSM. In a previous letter
we noted [15], that parabolic manifolds in a JSM may lead to eigenstates of
the S matrix localized near this manifold (see also below). As we mentioned
above the semicircles behave quite similarly, and as we do ﬁnd states local-
ized near these semi circles this again proves the applicability of the JSM to
the description of the ionizing part of the spectrum in a semiclassical limit.
Fig. 9(d) displays the Husimi plot of the ﬁrst resonance seen in Fig. 8. It
is quantized along the border of the regions of bound and unbound motion,
yielding a large overlap with the open part resulting in a large width of the
resonance. All resonances seen in Fig. 8 have similar Husimi plots. Functions
lying further from the open channels would again correspond to extremely
narrow resonances, which cannot easily be seen in the eigenphases with the

4.4.2 Strong coupling

Choosing as coupling strength µ50 = 9.81 the open part slightly greater than
half a sphere. Fig. 10(a) shows the combined PM + JSM. Except for the ﬁxed
points described below all points of this combined PM + JSM pertain to a
single trajectory. Due to the large value of the coupling this trajectory jumps
randomly in and out of the bounded part within a few steps. The combined
map is chaotic everywhere in this part. Fig. 11 displays the phase shifts. One
sees a lot of avoided crossings between the phase curves, signaling a chaotic
situation. A typical Husimi plot of an arbitrary wave function is shown in
Fig. 10(b).

The important ﬁxed points of this map (apart from isolated unstable ﬁxed
points embedded in the chaotic sea) are

(i) the

OX axis in the bound part (PM) surrounded by a very small island
of stability, too small with the present value of ~ to capture a single
quantum state.

(ii) the

OZ axis in the open part surrounded by a larger regular island of
the JSM. These are ﬁxed points because the collision induces a rotation
around OZ, entirely embedded in the open part (JSM).

In particular the parabolic manifold is embedded in the chaotic sea. A nearly
horizontal curve may be observed in the middle of Fig. 11. It corresponds to
the ﬁxed points of this parabolic manifold in the equatorial plane as shown
by Fig. 10(c)(see also ref. [15]). For e.g. the stadium billiard, such manifolds
of ﬁxed points embedded in a chaotic sea have signiﬁcant quantum eﬀects.
There they give rise to the so called bouncing ball states which in turn lead
to deviations of the spectral ﬂuctuation properties in the eigenvalue spectrum
from the random matrix results [37]. We expect similar quantum eﬀects of
the parabolic manifolds on statistical properties of the eigenphases of the
scattering matrix. When considering eigenphases of the scattering matrix as
a function of the energy E or the coupling strength µL, we ﬁnd eigenphases
OZ poles, surrounded
which merely change. The other ﬁxed point near the

It corresponds to a horizontal line near τ =

avoided crossings. It nevertheless traps a quantum state as seen in Fig. 10(d).

where, as in the remainder of this section, we use the notations of the review
paper of W.H. Miller [38]. In particular the i and the signs in the argument of
the square root function take care of the Maslov index.

We ﬁrst notice that the simple minded way of using this equation, computing
S =
pdq using the formulae obtained in the previous classical part of this
paper and the previous ones does not work, because our “classical” molecular
reference frame is a moving frame, implying that LZC is not conjugate to ϕC
L .
Indeed consider ﬁrst the collision step. The change of orientation of L in this

R

31

frame entails, by conservation of angular momentum, a change of the orien-
tation of N, and thus of the orientation of this frame, by an angle called δϕ′
L
in section 2 and ϕQ
N in Appendix A.1. This extra rotation of the frame im-
plies that LZC is no longer the generator of rotations of ϕC
L around the OZC
axis. For the collision step this problem can be solved by using the “quan-
tum” molecular reference frame, which is ﬁxed, since the collision is taken
as instantaneous, and that this frame is obtained from the laboratory frame
by a rotation with ﬁxed Euler angles ϕM , θM , 0 (see Appendix A). That this
analysis is correct is shown by noting that the transformation produced by the
collision in the “quantum” reference frame δϕQ
L is canonical (the
exterior diﬀerential product dLZQ ∧
L is conserved), while the corresponding
for the “classical” frame quantities is not. Moreover the transformation from
the “quantum” to the “classical” molecular reference frame is not canonical as
shown in Appendix A.1, where we have computed the momentum conjugate to
ϕC
L , such that this transformation becomes canonical (eq. A.7). Nevertheless,
since our goal is physical evidence we prefer to stick to our previous practice of
using LZC , ϕC
L . The only drawback of using non canonical coordinates is that
the map is not area preserving on the sphere, a minor eﬀect for L/J = 1/5 or
1/2 as chosen in this paper.

L = K cos θQ

dϕQ

For the collision step we thus can solve this problem by using the “quantum”
molecular frame, but the problem reappears for the Coulomb step, where this
frame is also moving. We could compute everything in the laboratory frame,
but it is more meaningful to use the “quantum” molecular frame for the col-
lision step, the laboratory frame for the Coulomb step, and two semiclassical
formulae for the change between these coordinate frames. This procedure fol-
lows closely the purely quantum formulation, giving a semiclassical approx-
imation for each of the steps which enter in the discussion of section 3, as
shown in Table 1. It provides direct evidence that MQDT indeed is the exact
quantization of the Bogomolny formulation, in particular that eqs. (26, 35) are
the exact counterpart of the semi classical eq. (1.20) of ref. [10], remembering
that ˆ
E

describes half a turn, while T describes a full turn.

As Poincar´e section we select in coordinate space the intersection at radius
r0 with outgoing trajectories, i.e. an “after collision” Poincar´e map. We thus
write:

T = U cU QLU f U LQ

(37)

where from right to left the U i’s indicate the unitary semiclassical operators
for the transformation from the “quantum” molecular reference frame to the
laboratory frame, free motion in the laboratory frame, back to the “quantum”
molecular frame and collision in the “quantum” frame. All these operators are
built with F2 / F3 kind of generating functions, i.e. they are of the form

where I ′ is the momentum conjugate to the coordinate ϕ′ and the resulting
integral is evaluated with the stationary phase approximation. This generat-
ing function is of type F3 as it is a function of the old momentum I ′ and
the new coordinate ϕ. An auxiliary Fourier transform is used to go from old
to old momentum I ′. Evaluating the inner dI ′ integral by the
coordinate ϕ
stationary phase approximation amounts to computing an F1 type generating
function, and inverting the order of the Fourier transform and of the F integral
amounts to deﬁning an F2 generating function. Note that we have deﬁned by
this double integral a U operator which goes from coordinate ϕ′ to coordinate
ϕ representation, while the F3 integral on its own gives an operator from the
old momentum I ′ to the new coordinate ϕ. Hence, we can compute eq. (37) by
performing four integrations instead of eight by alternating between the co-
ordinate and the momentum representations. We can compute with the same
procedure a momentum coordinate TΛΛ′ matrix by simply introducing two
Fourier Transforms to the left and the right of the operator T . As momenta
are quantized TΛΛ′ depends on discrete variables, while T (ϕ, ϕ′) is a function
of continuous arguments If there are no singularities all these possibilities give
the same result. We shall use them freely in order to obtain generating func-
tions which we can compute analytically and we shall see in section 5.3 that
this choice oﬀers possibilities to circumvent singularity problems.

5.2 Computations

{

LZQ, ϕQ

First notice that the conjugate pair of coordinates in the “quantum” molecular
frame is the known
pair. The momentum in the laboratory frame
is the modulus N of N. Intuitively the conjugate angle is the angle ϕN of
rotation of the core axis ˆM around N, referred to a reference axis which only
can be J. Explicit formulae for computing the transformation are given in
to
Appendix A.2, where we also show that the transformation from
N, ϕN }
is indeed canonical, justifying our intuition concerning the deﬁnition

of ϕN .

The computation of the F3 generating functions for the collision and the free
rotation steps follows the same scheme. In both cases the momentum is con-
served, while the angle is increased by an amount which is a function of the
corresponding momentum I only δϕ = f (I), respectively δϕQ

a function of N only for a given total energy E. Using the equations deﬁning

The computation of the F2 or F3(LZQ, ϕN ) is more tricky. First, whether it is
a F2 or F3 generating function depends on which is the original and the new
frame, and we need both transformations. To go in the opposite direction we
use the unitarity of the operator U. We start with the following formula which
expresses N as a function of the independent variables:

equals the sum of the coeﬃcients of LZQ in the ﬁrst and third terms of eq. (42)

We do not need to evaluate all intermediate integrals by stationary phase to
obtain the amplitudes. Indeed, it was shown in ref. [38] that the formula for
the amplitude given in eq.(36) is a direct consequence of the action being a F1
generating function of a canonical transformation between the initial and the
ﬁnal states. We thus only need to compute the second derivative of S with re-
spect to ϕQ
. For this we use the derivatives of S with respect to initial
variables L′

various steps, and general calculus formulae for second derivatives of inverse
functions. We have checked that these amplitudes obey the relationship,

the existence of divergences of the amplitudes. Fig. 12 plots the amplitudes
of T as a function of the initial position on the Poincar´e sphere, which was
used as a ﬁrst step to compute them. The black lines of maxima are actually
divergences. They are at diﬀerent positions for the two representations.

The physical meaning of these divergences is the existence of focus singulari-
ties. We discuss the ϕ representation ﬁrst, by referring to Fig. 13(a). Various
trajectories starting from the same coordinate point with diﬀerent momenta

of the image in (b), common especially to chaotic situations, is the cause of the
focus singularity: see text.

The problem of singularities is common in any semi classical analysis. Their
solution, usually called “regularization” follow two main routes. The ﬁrst, com-
mon in physics textbooks, is to revert to a full quantum computation near the
singular point, and to match the results with the semi classical computation
distant from it. Notice that the MQDT analysis is such a fully quantum so-

36

lution. The second, common in some mathematical works, is to notice that
we can circumvent the problem by changing from coordinate to momentum
representation through a Fourier transform. The singularity is a result of a
projection from phase space onto coordinate space; there are no singularties
in phase space itself. The back bending in Fig. 13(b) which is tangent to a
meridian of the sphere is not tangent, at this point, to a parallel. The starting
points in Fig. 12 which project onto the same ϕ′ project to diﬀerent L′
Z. The
lines of singularities exist in both representations in Fig. 12, but they appear
at diﬀerent points. So one can compute the points of the map by diﬀerent
routes, a possibility rooted on the possible choice at each U step in the com-
putation of T (eq. (37)) to select the ϕ or LZ representation, both in the initial
and the ﬁnal state. The only remaining problem is the fact that both lines of
OZ poles. To solve it we would have to use a more
singularities share the
general change of canonical coordinates on the sphere, a rotation which can
change the position of the poles. We do not attempt to do this in the present
paper.

6 Conclusion

We have formulated the multichannel quantum defect theory for Rydberg
molecules as the quantization of a classical symplectic map composed of a
standard surface of section for negative electron energies and a Jung scatter-
ing map for positive ones. This formulation elucidates MQDT from an entirely
diﬀerent point of view. Simultaneously we have shown it to provide consider-
able computational advantages.

The method was applied in the context of a simpliﬁed model, where only one
rotational degree of freedom for the molecule was taken into account. Simulta-
neously, the absolute value of the electron angular momentum was ﬁxed. This
approximation allows for a two dimensional surface of section, and simpliﬁed
calculations, but is not essential to the representation of MQDT as a quantum
Poincar´e map. These applications demonstrate the simpliﬁcations achieved.
Finally we establish the relation to Bogomolny’s [9,10,11] semi classical for-
mulation of the quantum Poincar´e map. Considering caustics we can clearly
see the basic diﬀerence between the exact and the semi-classical map.

A Reference Frames

We use three reference frames, the laboratory reference frame Oxyz, and
two molecular reference frames, called “Classical” OXCYCZC and “Quantum”
OXQYQZQ molecular reference frames.

In purely classical computations the “Classical” right handed molecular refer-
ence frame is deﬁned in such a way that OZC lies along the inter nuclear axis
ˆM of the molecular ionic core, and OXC lies along its angular momentum N.
This is adequate because the two steps of the dynamics, namely the collision
and the free rotation, are rotations about theses itwo axes. We always use it to
display our results, as the physical content is most obvious within this frame.

However, this is not the molecular reference frame selected in usual deﬁnitions
of quantum wave functions. There the molecular frame OXQYQZQ is deﬁned
as the one deduced from the laboratory frame Oxyz by a rotation of three
Euler angles (with the conventions of [18]). The ﬁrst two are well deﬁned,
namely ϕM , θM , the polar angles of ˆM. The third is arbitrary for a diatomic
molecule, since it corresponds to a rotation around the molecular axis. It is
given an arbitrary value 0 or π/2, depending on authors; we will select 0 as in
[2].

Both reference frames share the same OZ = ˆM axis, but have diﬀerent OX

38

axes. The classical OXC = N axis is not well deﬁned in quantum mechanics,
since N is a momentum conjugate to the angles ϕM , and θM , which are the
variables deﬁning the rotational molecular wave function in eqs. (2–3). Thus
the classical reference frame deﬁnes the usual quantum wave functions only
in the semi classical limit. But conversely, the quantum reference frame is
also well deﬁned in classical mechanics. So, if we want to compare classical
and quantum results, we do the quantum calculations in the usual quantum
reference frame, and then plot the resulting Wigner or Husimi distributions
in the classical reference frame, by applying the well deﬁned classical rotation
which brings the quantum reference frame onto the classical one.

We shall now compute the formulae which connect these three frames. They
are based on the fact that we can compute the position of J and N in
OXQYQZQ once we know the position of L in this frame, using simple geomet-
rical relations: see Fig. 2(b). We ﬁrst need to deﬁne precisely the laboratory
reference frame. Since everything is invariant with respect to a rotation of
the whole space, we may choose the Oz axis along J (Fig. 2(a)). Quantum
state. Conversely,
mechanically this amounts to studying the
once we know the position of J in the molecular frame, we know the position
of the Oz axis of the laboratory frame in OXQYQZQ, but there is no way
to locate the Ox and the Oy in this molecular frame. This is a consequence
of the rotational invariance of the problem. The corresponding angle ϕM is
conjugate to Jz, and is one of the variables we have eliminated when reducing
the dimension of phase space from 10 to 4 (or 6 if L is not kept constant).

The position of J in OXQYQZQ is a simple consequence of our choice of 0 as
the third Euler angle of the rotation which brings the laboratory frame Oxyz
onto the “Quantum” molecular reference frame OXQYQZQ. These three Euler
angles are ϕM , θM , and 0. The ﬁrst Euler rotation of the angle ϕM keeps J =
Oz ﬁxed and brings Oy onto OYQ. The second Euler rotation around OYQ by
an angle θM brings Oz onto OZQ. Conversely the position of J in the molecular

A.1 Transformations between “Classical” and “Quantum” molecular frames

Let us compute N in OXQYQZQ. For a diatomic molecule, the momentum
N is perpendicular to the inter nuclear axis ˆM, since the moment of inertia
around the inter nuclear axis is zero. Thus N is in the OXQYQ plane. We then
write N = J

Thus the “quantum” molecular reference frame angles for L are related to
their corresponding “classical” reference frame value via:

The reverse is not obtained by simply inverting this relation. We rather express
the relation J = N + L in the “classical” reference frame, where we know that
N is along OXC.

A.2 Transformation between “Quantum” molecular reference frame and lab-

The canonical momentum and angle in the “quantum” molecular reference
frame are LZQ and ϕQ
L . The canonical momentum and angle in the laboratory
frame (for the reduced phase space) are N and its conjugate angle ϕN , to
be deﬁned, and not to be confused with ϕQ
N (eq. A.3), which is the angle
of N in the plane OXQYQ. We ﬁrst express N as a function of “quantum”
molecular coordinates (eq. (1) was with “classical” molecular coordinates).

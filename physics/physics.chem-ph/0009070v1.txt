Abstract

Theoretical model of the nuclear spin conversion in formaldehyde (H2CO)

has been developed. The conversion is governed by the intramolecular spin-

rotation mixing of molecular ortho and para states. The rate of conversion
has been found equal γ/P = 1.4 · 10−4 s−1/Torr. Temperature dependence of
the spin conversion has been predicted to be weak in the wide temperature

range T = 200 − 900 K.

I. INTRODUCTION

It is well known that many symmetrical molecules exist in nature only in the form of

nuclear spin isomers [1]. The spin isomers demonstrate anomalous stability. For example,

the ortho and para isomers of H2 survive almost 1 year at 1 atm and room temperature [2].

Existence of spin isomers is well-understood in the framework of the spin-statistics relation

in quantum mechanics. On the other hand, the dynamical part of the problem, viz., the

isomer stability, their conversion rates and responsible conversion mechanisms are less clear.

This is because experimental data on spin isomers are rare due to substantial diﬃculties in

preparation of enriched spin isomer samples. Thus each new experimental result in this ﬁeld

deserves close attention.

In this paper we perform theoretical analysis of the nuclear spin conversion in formalde-

hyde (H2CO). This process was considered theoretically previously [3]. But it is worthwhile

to perform new analysis in order to account new important information. First, the formalde-

hyde spin conversion was recently investigated experimentally and the gas phase conversion

rate was measured for the ﬁrst time [4]. Second, formaldehyde molecular structure and

molecular spectroscopic parameters have been determined very accurately [5–7]. Third,

simple theoretical model of nuclear spin conversion in asymmetric tops was developed and

tested by the spin conversion in ethylene [8]. All these circumstances allow to advance

signiﬁcantly theory of the spin conversion in formaldehyde.

II. DIRECT AND INDIRECT CONVERSION MECHANISMS

There are two main mechanisms known for the gas phase spin conversion in molecules.

The ﬁrst one, direct, consists in the following.

In the course of collision inhomogeneous

magnetic ﬁeld produced by collision partner induces direct transitions in the test molecule

between spin states. This mechanism is responsible for the hydrogen isomer conversion by

paramagnetic O2 [9]. It is important for us that the hydrogen conversion induced by O2 (the
rate is equal to 8 · 10−6 s−1/Torr [2]) appears to be much slower than the spin conversion in
formaldehyde [4],

γexp/P = (1.1 ± 0.3) · 10−3 s−1/Torr.

Note that we refer here to the formaldehyde ortho-para equilibration rate. In notations of

[4] this rate is equal to k1 + k2, where k1 and k2 are the ortho-to-para and para-to-ortho

conversion rates, respectively.

Hydrogen is an exceptional molecule due to its anomalously large ortho-para level spacing

and high symmetry. It is more appropriate for the present discussion to consider the direct

mechanism in polyatomic molecules. The isomer conversion in CH3F induced by O2 was

investigated theoretically and experimentally in [10,11]. It was found that this mechanism
provides the conversion rate on the order of 10−4 − 10−5 s−1/Torr. These rates refer to the
collisions with paramagnetic O2 which have magnetic moment close to Bohr magneton, µB.

An experimental arrangement in [4] corresponds to “nonmagnetic” collision partner having

a magnetic moment on the order of nuclear magneton, µn, thus by 103 times smaller. The

conversion rate by direct mechanism depends on magnetic moment as µ2 [10]. It implies that

the conversion by direct process is too slow to be taken into account for the formaldehyde

conversion. In fact, the authors [4] had arrived at the same conclusion.

Second mechanism is applicable to molecules in which diﬀerent spin states can be quan-

tum mechanically mixed by weak intramolecular perturbation. Mixing and interruption of

this mixing by collisions with the surrounding particles result in the isomer conversion. We

will refer to this mechanism as quantum relaxation. Quantum relaxation can provide sig-

niﬁcantly faster conversion than direct process does for nonmagnetic particles. It can be

illustrated by a few examples in which quantum relaxation was established to be a leading

process. The most studied case is the spin conversion in 13CH3F (for the review see [12]).
The conversion rate in this molecule was determined as (12.2 ± 0.6) · 10−3 s−1/Torr. The
conversion rate in ethylene (13CCH4) is equal to (5.2 ± 0.8) · 10−4 s−1/Torr [13].
In this
molecule too the quantum relaxation is the leading process [8]. Thus one can conclude that

for the spin conversion in formaldehyde quantum relaxation is an appropriate mechanism.

The formaldehyde molecules have two nuclear spin isomers, ortho (total spin of the two

hydrogen nuclei, I = 1) and para (I = 0). Each rotational state of the molecule can belong

only to ortho, or to para isomers. Thus the molecular states are divided into two subspaces

as it is shown in Fig. 1. Simple physical picture of spin conversion by quantum relaxation is

given elsewhere, e.g., [12]. Quantitative description of the process can be performed in the

framework of the density matrix formalism. The result of this description is as follows [14].

One has to split the molecular Hamiltonian into two parts,

ˆH = ˆH0 + ˆV ,

(2)

where the main part of the Hamiltonian, ˆH0, has pure ortho and para states as the eigen-
states; the perturbation ˆV mixes the ortho and para states. If at initial instant the nonequi-

librium concentration of, say, ortho molecules, δρo(t = 0), was created, the system will relax

then exponentially, δρo(t) = δρo(0)e−γt, with the rate

γ = Xa∈o,a′∈p

2ΓF (a|a′)
Γ2 + ω2
aa′

(Wo(α) + Wp(α′)) ; F (a|a′) ≡ Xν∈o,ν ′∈p |Vαα′|2.

(3)

where Γ is the decay rate of the oﬀ-diagonal density matrix element ραα′ (α ∈ ortho; α′ ∈
para) assumed here to be equal for all ortho-para level pairs; ωaa′ is the gap between the

states a and a′; Wo(α) and Wp(α′) are the Boltzmann factors of the corresponding states.
The sets of quantum numbers α ≡ {a, ν} and α′ ≡ {a′, ν′} consist of the degenerate quantum
numbers ν, ν′ and the quantum numbers a, a′ which determine the energy of the states. In

Eq. (3) and further the ortho states will be denoted by unprimed characters, but para states

by primed characters. For the following it is convenient to introduce the strength of mixing,
F (a|a′). In the deﬁnition of F (a|a′) in Eq. (3) the summation is made over all degenerate
states.

The general model (3) was tested comprehensively by conversion in symmetric tops

(13CH3F, 12CH3F) and asymmetric top, 13CCH4. It was proven that the ortho-para mixing

is performed in these molecules by intramolecular hyperﬁne interactions. Thus, the spin

isomer conversion gives an alternative access to very weak intramolecular forces which was

investigated previously by high resolution spectroscopy, e.g., Laser Stark Spectroscopy [15]

and Microwave Fourier Transform Spectroscopy [16].

To avoid confusion we stress that γ from Eq. (3) gives the equilibration rate in the

system if one would measure the concentration of ortho (or para) molecules. The authors [4]

introduced the ortho-to-para (k1) and para-to-ortho (k2) rates which are equal, respectively,
to the ﬁrst and second terms in the expression (3) for γ. Thus γ ≡ k1 + k2. Relation between
the formaldehyde ortho and para partition functions (see below) explains the equality k2 =

3k1 [4].

III. ROTATIONAL STATES OF FORMALDEHYDE

The formaldehyde molecule is a prolate, nearly symmetric top having symmetry group

C2v. The characters of the group operations and its irreducible representations are given in

the Table 1. The molecular structure and orientation of the molecular system of coordinates

are given in Fig. 2. The formaldehyde is a planar molecule having the following parameters
in the ground state rCH = 1.1003 ± 0.0005 ˚A, rCO = 1.2031 ± 0.0005 ˚A, and αHCO =
121.62 ± 0.05o [6].

Rotational states of formaldehyde in the ground electronic and vibrational state can be

determined with high accuracy using the octic order Hamiltonian of Watson [17,5,7],

(4)

where J, Jx, Jy, and Jz are the molecular angular momentum operator and its projections on

the molecular axes. The B, C, and A are the parameters of a rigid top which characterize the

rotation around x, y, and z molecular axes, respectively (see Fig. 2). The rest of parameters

account for the centrifugal distortion eﬀects [17]. In Eq. (4) the notation was used

Fn ≡ J n

z (J 2

x − J 2

y ) + (J 2

x − J 2

y )J n
z .

(5)

We left in the Hamiltonian (4) only those terms for which molecular parameters in [5] were

not set to zero.

It is convenient to diagonalise the Hamiltonian (4) in the Wang basis [1],

|α, p > =

|α0, p > =

1

√2 h|α > +(−1)J+K+p|α >i ; 0 < K ≤ J,
1 + (−1)J+p

|α0 >; K = 0.

2

(6)

Here p = 0, 1; |α > are the symmetric-top rotational states; the sets of quantum numbers
are α ≡ {J, K, M}; |α >≡ {J,−K, M}; α0 ≡ {J, K = 0, M} where J, K, and M are the
quantum numbers of angular momentum and its projection on the molecular symmetry axis

and on the laboratory quantization axis, respectively. Depending on the parity of J, K and

5

p, the states (6) generate 4 diﬀerent irreducible representations of the molecular symmetry

group C2v, as it is explained in the Table 1. In the following we will need the reduction of
the matrix elements of full symmetric operator ˆV in the basis |α, p > to the matrix elements
of symmetric-top states |α >. This reduction reads

< α, p|V |α′, p′ > = δp,p′h< α|V |α′ > +(−1)J ′+p′
< α, p|V |α′
< α|V |α′

1 + (−1)J ′+p′

< α|V |α′ >i ; K ′ > 0,
0 >; K ′ = 0.

0, p > = δp,p′

√2

(7)

The molecular Hamiltonian, ˆH0, is full symmetric (symmetry A1). Consequently, the

matrix elements between the states of diﬀerent symmetry disappear. Thus diagonalization of

the total Hamiltonian in the basis of (6) is reduced to the diagonalization of four independent

submatrices, each for the states of particular symmetry. The rotational states of asymmetric

top can be expanded over the basis states (6),

|β, p >= XK

AK|α, p >,

(8)

where AK stands for the expansion coeﬃcients. The summation variable, K, is shown

explicitly in (8), although AK depends on other quantum numbers as well. All coeﬃcients

in the expansion (8) are real numbers because the Hamiltonian (4) is symmetric in the basis
|α, p >.

Complete description of the asymmetric-top quantum state needs indication of all expan-

sion coeﬃcients, AK, from (8) which is not practical. There are a few schemes for abbreviate

notations, see, e.g., [18]. We will use here the notations which are somewhat better adopted

to the consideration of the spin isomer problem in asymmetric tops [8]. We will designate

the rotational states of asymmetric top by indicating p, J and prescribing the allowed K

values to the eigen states keeping both in ascending order. For example, the eigen state

having p = 0, J = 20, the allowed K in the expansion (8) equal K = 0, 2, 4 . . .20 and being
the third in ascending order will be designated by (p = 0, J = 20, K = 4). Note the
diﬀerence between the two characters K and K. It gives unambiguous notation of rotational
states for each of the four species A1, A2 (K-even) and B1, B2 (K-odd). This classiﬁcation
becomes exact for a prolate symmetric top for which K = K.

Calculation of the level energies and wave functions of molecular quantum states were

performed in the paper numerically. Accuracy of these calculations can be estimated by

6

comparing with the experimental rotational spectra in the ground state of formaldehyde [5].

This comparison shows that the accuracy of the calculations for most rotational states is in
the range of 10 − 100 kHz. This should be suﬃcient for the investigation of the spin isomer
conversion in formaldehyde.

The two equivalent hydrogen nuclei in H2CO have spin 1/2. It implies that the total

wave function (product of spin and spatial wave functions) is of symmetry B1. Spin states

of the two hydrogen nuclei can be either triplet (ortho, I = 1, symmetry A1), or singlet

(para, I = 0, symmetry B1).

In order to have the total wave function of symmetry B1,

the ortho molecules should have the spatial wave function of symmetry B1, but the para

molecules should have the spatial wave function of symmetry A1. Consequently, in the

ground electronic and vibrational state the rotational states A1 and B1 are only positive

(even in parity), but the states A2 and B2 are only negative (odd in parity).

The ortho states of the formaldehyde molecule can be presented as

|µ >= |β, p > |I = 1, σ >; K − odd.

(9)

where σ is the projection of the nuclear spin I on the laboratory quantization axis. The

para states can be presented as

|µ′ >= |β′, p′ > |I ′ = 0 >; K′ − even.

(10)

The Boltzmann factors Wo(α) and Wp(α′) in Eq. (3) determine the population of the

states α and α′ in the ortho and para families,

ρα = ρoWo(α); ρα′ = ρpWp(α′),

(11)

where ρo and ρp are the total densities of ortho and para molecules, respectively. The

partition functions for ortho and para molecules at room temperature (T=300 K) are found

to be equal to

Zortho = 2.16 · 103; Zpara = 721.

(12)

In the calculation of these partition functions the energies of the rotational states were

determined numerically using the Hamiltonian (4). The degeneracy over M, σ, as well as

the restrictions imposed by the quantum statistics were taken into account.

IV. MIXING OF THE ORTHO AND PARA STATES

There are two known intramolecular perturbations able to mix ortho and para states

in polyatomic molecules. The ﬁrst one is the spin-spin interaction between the molecular

nuclei. This interaction has simple form in formaldehyde and can be expressed as [1]

ˆVSS = P12ˆI(1)ˆI(2) •
Tij = δij − 3δi,xδj,x ; P12 = µ2

• T ;

p/r3I (1)I (2)h ,

(13)

where ˆI(1) and ˆI(2) are the spin operators of the hydrogen nuclei 1 and 2; µp is magnetic
moment of proton; i and j are the Cartesian indices. The second rank tensor ˆI(1)ˆI(2) acts

on spin variables. The second rank tensor T represents a spatial part of the spin-spin

interaction. One can deduce from the angular momentum algebra that all matrix elements
of the perturbation ˆVSS between ortho and para states of formaldehyde are vanishing. This

is because one cannot draw a triangle having the sides 2, 1, and 0, which are the rank of the
tensor ˆI(1)ˆI(2), the total spin of ortho, and para states, respectively.

The second intramolecular perturbation which should be considered is the spin-rotation

coupling between spins of hydrogen nuclei and molecular rotation. The spin-rotation cou-

pling can be presented in general as [19,18,20]

ˆVSR ≡ Xn

ˆV (n)
SR =

1

2  Xn

ˆI(n) • C(n) • ˆJ + h.c.! ; n = 1, 2.

(14)

Here C is the spin-rotation tensor; ˆJ is the angular momentum operator. Index n in (14)

refers only to the hydrogen nuclei because we are interested now in the perturbation able to

mix ortho and para states.

Calculation of the spin-rotational tensor, C, is a complicated problem. Further, a few

simpliﬁcations will be made. First, we neglect small contribution to the tensor C due to the

electric ﬁelds at the position of protons [21]. The remaining part of the tensor C originates

from the magnetic ﬁelds produced by the electrical currents in the molecule. One can split

the tensor C into two terms,

C = eC + nC,

(15)

where eC and nC are due to the electron and nuclear currents in the molecule, respectively.

The electron part, eC, appears as an average over electron state, which has nonzero value

8

only in the second order perturbation theory. Its calculation needs the knowledge of electron

excited states and thus is rather diﬃcult to perform. On the other hand, the nuclear part,

nC, has nonzero value for the ground electron state and can be easily estimated. In the
following we will neglect the electron part, eC, and will use the estimation C≃ nC. This
can be considered as an upper limit for C because molecular electrons are following the

rotation of nuclear frame and thus compensate partially the magnetic ﬁeld produced by

nuclei.

The spin-rotation tensor nC can be presented (in Hz) as [21]

C(n) = Xk6=n

bk [(rk • Rk)1 − rkRk] • B;

bk = 2µpqk/c¯hR3

k ,

(16)

where Rk is the radial vector from the proton H(n) to the charge k; rk is the radial from the

center of mass to the particle k; qk are the nuclei’ charges; B is the inverse matrix of inertia

moment. B is a diagonal matrix having the elements Bxx = 68.0 GHz, Byy = 77.67 GHz,

and Bzz = 563.9 GHz. Index k runs here over all nuclei in the molecule except the proton

n.

SR|µ′ >=< µ|V (2)

Using the symmetry operation C2 one can prove the equality of the two matrix elements,
SR|µ′ >. Thus for the evaluation of the spin-rotation coupling in
SR|µ′ >. We write

< µ|V (1)
formaldehyde it is suﬃcient to calculate one matrix element, e.g., < µ|V (1)
this matrix element using an expansion over symmetric-top states (8),

(17)

This expression and (7) reduce the calculation of the spin-rotation matrix elements of asym-

metric tops to the calculation of symmetric-top matrix elements. Solution for the latter can

be found in [22,20,23], which allows to express the strength of mixing in formaldehyde by
ˆVSR as

The selection rules for the ortho-para mixing by spin-rotation perturbation in formalde-

hyde read

Parity of K′ and K is opposite.

∆p = 0;

|∆J| ≤ 1.

(21)

V. CONVERSION RATES

For the calculations of the isomer conversion rate one needs the value of the ortho-para

decoherence rate, Γ, see Eq. (3). Experimental determination of this parameter can be based

on the level-crossing resonances in spin conversion. Such measurements were performed so
far only for the 13CH3F spin conversion and gave Γ/P ≃ 2 · 108 s−1/Torr (see the discussion
in [12]). Estimation of Γ can be done using the pressure line broadening data. For polar
molecules the line broadening is on the order of ∼ 108 s−1/Torr. Further, we will assume
the decoherence rate being equal to

Γ/P = 1 · 108 s−1/Torr.

(22)

The same value of Γ was used in [4].

It is clear from Eq. (3) that only close ortho-para level pairs can contribute signiﬁcantly

to the spin conversion. Formaldehyde is a light molecule having large level spacing. The

10

average density of levels in the range 0 − 1000 cm−1 is low, 1 level per each 5 cm−1. As was
pointed out already in [3], there are regular and “accidental” ortho-para resonances. An
example of regular resonances (p = 0, J,K = 1) − (p′ = 0, J,K′ = 0) is shown in Fig. 3. The
ortho-para gaps in this sequence of states goes rapidly down as ∼ exp(−0.23J). Analogous
phenomenon of collapsing ortho and para states exists also in ethylene where decrease of

gaps is even faster [8].

Calculated spin conversion rates are given in the Table 2. The total conversion rate
combines contributions from all ortho-para level pair having J up to 40 and |ω| < 40 GHz.
Thus the spin conversion rate in formaldehyde is

γ/P = 1.4 · 10−4 s−1/Torr.

(23)

One can conclude from the data presented in Table 2 that the close sequence of states

from Fig. 3 does not contribute signiﬁcantly to the conversion. The same eﬀect was found in

the ethylene conversion [8]. Another observation from the Table 2 is that there are no close

ortho-para level pairs in formaldehyde which can be mixed by the spin-rotation coupling.

The most important ortho-para level pair which contributes more than 50% to the total rate
is the pair (1,18,2)–(1,17,3). It has the energy gap ≃ 6 GHz. The expansion coeﬃcients,
AK, for these states are presented in Fig. 4. One can see from these data that the wave

functions of these states are rather close to the symmetric-top case which would have just

one term in the expansion (8).

VI. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

Calculated value of the conversion rate in formaldehyde was found to be almost 10 times

smaller than the experimental one [4]. There are two main uncertainties in the present

calculations which both can be deﬁned more accurately by future experiments. The ﬁrst

uncertainty comes from the decoherence rate, Γ. This parameter can be determined by

careful study of the pressure broadening of rotational lines in the formaldehyde ground

state. The second uncertainty originates from poor knowledge of the spin-rotation coupling

in formaldehyde. The spin-rotation coupling in H2CO can be investigated using high res-

olution spectroscopy methods, e.g., Laser Stark Spectroscopy [15] and Microwave Fourier

11

Transform Spectroscopy [16] which were proven to be eﬃcient for the investigation of hy-

perﬁne interactions in molecules.

In general, it is diﬃcult to verify the mechanism of spin conversion in formaldehyde by

comparing single values of the theoretical and experimental conversion rates, which depends

in theory on a number of parameters and in experiment can be resulted from a few eﬀects,

e.g., chemical reactions. It is more appropriate to compare the dependencies predicted by

the theory with the experimental dependencies. First, the model predicts rather strong

dependence of the conversion rate on the type of buﬀer gas. By varying the collision partner

one can change the decoherence rate, Γ, by nearly one order of magnitude. In the same

proportion the spin conversion rate should be changed if conversion is governed by quantum

relaxation. It is alarming that the authors [4] observed very small change of γ by adding

the argon gas up to the pressure of 760 Torr.

Another experimental veriﬁcation of the conversion mechanism could be the investigation

of temperature dependence. The theoretical temperature dependence of the spin conversion

rate in formaldehyde is shown in the Fig. 5. The calculation were done under an assumption

that the decoherence rate, Γ, is temperature independent. Such assumption is supported

by the slow temperature dependence of Γ observed in the case of spin conversion in 13CH3F

[12]. The theoretical model predicts rather weak inﬂuence of the gas temperature on the
formaldehyde conversion rate, γ, in the wide range of temperatures, T = 200 − 900 K.

In conclusion, we have developed theoretical model of the spin conversion in formalde-

hyde. Although this model has the same basic concepts as the model developed in [3], the

key parameters of the new model are more precise. First of all, it refers to the molecular

level energies and the wave functions.

We have analysed the relation between the theoretical model of the formaldehyde spin

conversion and the experiment [4]. The theoretical model in its present form gives 10 times

smaller conversion rate than the rate measured in [4]. Two types of experiments have been

proposed which can help to resolve the puzzle.

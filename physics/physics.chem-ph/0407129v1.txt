Abstract

Conductive organic polymers can be formulated with polymers that in-

corporate ﬁne dispersed metallic particles. In this work, we present a general

model for ferrogels which are chemically cross-linked polymer networks swollen

with a ferroﬂuid. Our aim is to study the eﬀect of the shape and/or material

(conductivity) anisotropy on the eﬀective electrical conductivity of the ferro-

gel in the presence of an external magnetic ﬁeld. Our theory can reproduce

the known results, and provides a link between the particle property and ori-

entation distribution and the eﬀective electrical conductivity. To this end, we

ﬁnd that material (conductivity) anisotropies are more important to yield a

high eﬀective electrical conductivity than shape anisotropies, while magnetic

ﬁelds can oﬀer a correction.

I. INTRODUCTION

Conductive polymers [1] have received much attention due to its extensive industrial

applications (for a review, see Ref. [2]), such as in nonlinear optical waveguides, vapor-phase

detectors, twisted nematic liquid crystal displays, and so on. In fact, the conductive organic

polymers [1] can be formulated with polymers that incorporate conductive additives such

as carbon black [2] or ﬁne dispersed metallic particles [3]. This is because the presence

of certain additives in the polymer can enhance the eﬀective electrical conductivity.

In

particular, recently organic polymer composites ﬁlled with conductive metallic particles

received much attention in scientiﬁc research [4–6]. For such polymer composites, their

electrical characteristic are close to that of metals, whereas the mechanical property and

processing method are typical for plastics [3–6]. The eﬀective electrical conductivity of

metal-polymer composite should depend on the conductivity of particles, the particle shape,

the volume fraction of particles, and the spatial orientation or alignment of particles in the

composite.

Ferrogels [7–10] are a new class of magneto-controlled elastic materials, which are chem-

ically cross-linked polymer networks swollen with a ferroﬂuid. A ferroﬂuid [11] is a colloidal

dispersion of monodomain ferromagnetic particles.

In the ferrogel, the ﬁnely distributed

magnetic particles are located in the swelling liquid and attached to the ﬂexible network

chains by adhesive forces. In the absence of an applied ﬁeld the magnetic moments are ran-

domly oriented, and thus the gel has no net magnetization. If an external ﬁeld is applied,

the magnetic moments tend to align with the ﬁeld, thus yielding a bulk magnetic moment.

In case of ordinary ﬁeld strengths, the tendency of the dipole moments to align with the

applied ﬁeld is partially overcome by thermal agitation. As the strength of ﬁeld increases, all

the particles eventually align their moments along the direction of the ﬁeld, and as a result,

the magnetization saturates. If the ﬁeld is turned oﬀ, the magnetic dipole moments quickly

randomize and thus the bulk magnetization is again reduced to zero. In a zero magnetic

ﬁeld a ferrogel presents a mechanical behavior very close to that of a swollen network ﬁlled

2

with non-magnetic colloidal particles. In uniform magnetic ﬁelds a ferrogel experiences no

net force, and hence no macroscopic shape changes and motion are observed. Ferrogels have

much application ranging from soft actuators, micromanipulators, and artiﬁcial muscles [7],

to cancer therapy [8] or as an apparatus for immunoblotting [9].

Anisotropy is a common phenomenon in most materials, and it can be an intrinsic mate-

rial property or induced by the application of ﬁelds. Also, in real applications, the shape of

particles may deviate from a perfect spherical shape during fabrication. In ferrogels, due to

the anisotropic particle shape and/or conductivity of the ferromagnetic particles, the speciﬁc

spatial orientation of the particles can be realized by using an external magnetic ﬁeld. Thus,

the electric properties of ferrogels can be controlled by reorientation of the particles in an

applied magnetic ﬁeld.

In this paper, we shall focus on an anisotropic ferrogel in which both the particle shape

and conductivity possess a tensorial form. Our aim is to study the eﬀects of the shape

and/or material (conductivity) anisotropy on the eﬀective electrical conductivity of the fer-

rogel, by taking into account the spatial orientation of the particles, which can be aﬀected

by the external magnetic ﬁeld. To this end, we ﬁnd both the shape anisotropy and the

external magnetic ﬁeld can cause the eﬀective electrical conductivity to increase. Further-

more, the material (conductivity) anisotropy can increase the eﬀective electrical conductivity

signiﬁcantly.

This paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we put forth a general model for a ferrogel

containing ellipsoidal ferromagnetic particles with anisotropic conductivity. In Sec. III, we

numerically calculate two cases, namely, spherical particles with anisotropic conductivity,

and spheroidal particles with isotropic conductivity, in an attempt to focus on the inﬂuence

of the shape and material anisotropy, respectively. This paper ends with a discussion and

conclusion in Sec. IV.

II. A GENERAL MODEL FOR ELLIPSOIDAL PARTICLES WITH

ANISOTROPIC CONDUCTIVITIES

Let us start by considering an ellipsoidal particle with depolarization factors Lx, Ly, Lz

along x, y, z axes, respectively. Namely, the depolarization factor has a tensor form

The three components satisfy a sum rule, Lx + Ly + Lz = 1 [12]. In the case of crystalline

anisotropic, the conductivity of the particle has a tensor form as

The particles are embedded in a host with a scalar conductivity σ2. In this paper, the

principle axes of

σ1 are assumed to be parallel to the geometric axes of the ellipsoidal

↔

particle. The orientation of the conductivity tensor

σ1 diﬀers from inclusion to inclusion,

such that

σ1 is transformed to

↔

in a common coordinate system, where

ν denotes the rotation matrix of a particle. For the

↔

volume average of the ﬁeld of the whole system hEi , one has [13]

phE1i + (1 − p)hELi = hEi,

where p stands for the volume fraction of particles, and hEi is equal to the applied ﬁeld E0

under appropriate boundary conditions [14]. Here h· · ·i denotes the volume average of · · · .

hELi represents the volume average of the Lorentz ﬁeld (namely, local ﬁeld in the vicinity

of the particles) which includes the contribution from the dipole moments of all the other

4

particles, and hE1i represents the volume average of the local ﬁeld inside the particles. Thus,

we can rewrite Eq. (4) as [13,14]

phE1i + (1 − p)hELi = E0,

Solving the electrostatic equation ∇2Φ1 = 0 (Φ1 denotes the electrical potential inside the

particles), we obtain hE1i such that [13]

Eq. (11) is a nontrivial equation, which can reproduce many other known results. For

instance, setting Lx = Ly 6= Lz and σ11 = σ22 = σ33, and seeing the particles randomly

oriented in a host, σe11 obtained from Eq. (11) is identical to Eq. (14) of Ref. [15]. In this case,

if the metallic particles are subjected to an external magnetic ﬁeld (i.e., no longer randomly

oriented), σe11(= σe22) and σe33 predicted by Eq. (11) are identical to Eqs. (3) and (4) of

Ref. [16], respectively. Finally, for spherical particles (namely, Lx = Ly = Lz) with a scalar

conductivity (i.e., σ11 = σ22 = σ33), Eq. (11) can produce the expression for the well-known

Maxwell Garnett theory [17,18], namely

σe = σ2 +

3pσ2(σ1 − σ2)
3σ2 + (1 − p)(σ1 − σ2)

.

III. NUMERICAL RESULTS

We are now in a position to do some numerical calculations. We shall discuss two cases:

(Case I) Spherical particle with tensorial conductivity; (Case II) Ellipsoidal particle with

scalar conductivity. In doing so, we can focus on the eﬀect of shape or material (conductivity)

anisotropies, respectively.

h˜↔
ρi can be obtained as [19]

To start, we have to derive the expression for h˜↔

ρi. For Lx = Ly 6= Lz and σ11 = σ22 6= σ33,

ρ11 + (ρ33 − ρ11)ζ

where ζ = hcos2 θi, with θ being the polar orientation angel of a particle, 0 ≤ θ ≤ π/2. Since

the orientation of the ferromagnetic particles in ferrogels can be aﬀected by the external

magnetic ﬁeld, there is ζ = 1 − 2L(α)/α [16]. Here L(α) denotes the Langevin function

and α = mH/kBT the Langevin parameter, where m represents the magnetic moment of

a particle, and H the magnetic ﬁeld, kB the Boltzmann constant, and T the temperature.

6

For the sake of convenience, α will be used to denote the magnetic ﬁeld in the following

numerical calculations. In a word, ζ contains the information of the spatial orientation of

the particles in the host. In particular, the zero ﬁeld (α = 0) yields ζ → 1/3 naturally due

to the random orientation of the particles. As α > 0, ζ deviates from 1/3 accordingly. In

other words, the speciﬁc spatial orientation of the particles in the ferrogel can be achieved

by adjusting the external magnetic ﬁeld.

A. Case I: Spherical particles with anisotropic conductivity

In this case, there are Lx = Ly = Lz = 1/3 and σ11 = σ22 6= σ33. In Fig. 1, we display

the eﬀective electrical conductivity versus the Langevin parameter for diﬀerent conductivity

ratio t (= σ33/σ11). In fact, t represents the degree of anisotropy of conductivity. We ﬁnd

increasing the Langevin parameter α causes σe11 to decrease, see Fig. 1(a)-(b). In contrast,

in Fig. 1(c)-(d), as α increases, σe33 increases ﬁrst, and decreases after a peak. In particular,

at α = 2.4 there is always a peak for log10[σe33/σ2].
10±4, the corresponding peak values are 10.92, 6.92, and 2.92, respectively. In other words,

In detail, for t = 10±12, 10±8, and

an optimal magnetic ﬁeld exists which leads to a maximum conductivity σe33. It is worth
noting that both t = 10−N and t = 10N (N is a number) can predict the same σe11 or

σe33 concerned, see Fig. 1(b) and (d). This behavior keeps unchanged up to N = 19 or

so. Moreover, larger N and hence a stronger conductivity anisotropy can lead to a higher

eﬀective electrical conductivity σe11 or σe33.

B. Case II: Ellipsoidal particles with isotropic conductivity

For this case, Lx = Ly 6= Lz, and σ11 = σ22 = σ33. Fig. 2 shows the eﬀective electrical

conductivity against the Langevin parameter α for diﬀerent depolarization factor Lz. For

prolate spheroidal particles (Lz < 1/3), smaller Lz can lead to higher σe11 or σe33, see Fig. 2.

In contrast, for oblate spheroidal particles (Lz > 1/3), larger Lz can yield higher σe11 or

lower σe33. Also, for the prolate spheroidal cases, increasing the magnetic ﬁeld causes σe11

7

(or σe33) to decrease (or increase). However, for the oblate spheroidal cases, as the magnetic

ﬁeld increases, σe11 increases, but σe33 decreases. In a word, the stronger shape anisotropy

(namely, how Lz deviates from 1/3) can yield a higher eﬀective electrical conductivity.

From Cases I and II, it is concluded that material (conductivity) anisotropies are more im-

portant to yield higher eﬀective electrical conductivities of ferrogels than shape anisotropies,

while magnetic ﬁelds can oﬀer a correction.

In addition, we also discussed the eﬀect of the volume fraction of particles (no ﬁgures

shown here).

It is shown that increasing the volume fraction of particles can cause the

eﬀective electrical conductivity to increase accordingly. This result is the same as that

obtained by Xue [20].

IV. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

Here some comments are in order. In this paper, we have presented a general model for

a ferrogel in which both the particle shape and conductivity have a tensorial form, in an

attempt to study the eﬀect of the shape and/or material (conductivity) anisotropy on the

eﬀective electrical conductivity of the ferrogel, by taking into account the spatial orientation

of the particles in the presence of an external magnetic ﬁeld. Our theory reproduced several

known results, and provides a link between the particle property and orientation distribution

and the eﬀective electrical conductivity of ferrogels.

For water, the minerals like sodium chloride are often dissolved in it, thus making it have

a conductivity. More importantly, as one tries to make pure water by gradually removing

electrolytes, its conductivity gradually decreases indeed. However, if all electrolytes are

removed, its conductivity is still nonzero. The reason is that an inﬁnitesimal part of the

molecules of water–only about one in 500 million–is ionized as hydrogen ions (H+) and

hydroxide ions (OH−). Theoretically, at this point, the conductivity becomes 5.48×10−6 S/m

at 25 oC. In contrast, the conductivity of polymers could be ∼ 10−15 S/m. For the ferrogel

discussed in this paper, we see the ferromagnetic particles to be embedded in the host

8

medium which is composed of polymers as well as water.

Since the structure and magnetization property of a polydisperse ferrogel can diﬀer from

that of a monodisperse system [21–23]. It is instructive to extend the present work to poly-

disperse case, so that one could investigate the polydisperse eﬀect on the eﬀective electrical

conductivity of polydisperse ferrogels.

In this work, we derived an anisotropic Maxwell-Garnett formula [Eq. (11)], which is non-

symmetrical and may thus be suitable for low concentrations. For a higher concentration of

particles, we can derive an alternative anisotropic Bruggeman formula (see Appendix), which

is symmetrical. Similar results should be obtained by means of the anisotropic Bruggeman

formula. However, the Bruggeman formula can predict a percolation threshold.

It is also interesting to see what happens if one extend the present model to investigate the

electro-optical eﬀects [19], nonlinearity enhancement [24], ﬁgure of merit [24], and nonlinear

ac responses [25–27] of ferrogels due to the presence of the (weak) nonlinearity inside the

metallic particles. In doing so, the particle reorientation arising from external magnetic ﬁelds

is expected to play a role as well. In addition, due to the analogy of the mathematical form

between conductivities and dielectric constants of composite materials, it is straightforward

to apply the present theory to the eﬀective dielectric constant of ferrogels.

To sum up, based on our general model, it was shown that material (conductivity)

anisotropies are more important to produce a high eﬀective electrical conductivity of ferrogels

than shape anisotropies, while magnetic ﬁelds can oﬀer a correction due to the change in

orientation distributions of particles.

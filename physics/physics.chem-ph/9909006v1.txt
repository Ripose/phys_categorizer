I. INTRODUCTION

Density functional theory (DFT) within the Kohn-Sham (KS) single-particle formalism
has now been established as a standard tool for the study of inhomogeneous quantum many-
electron systems. [1–3] The local density approximation (LDA) and generalized gradient
approximation (GGA) are successful in describing the ground state properties of various
systems. On the other hand, their eigenvalue spectra are known to be far from the reality,
and it has been assumed that KS orbital eigenvalues are auxiliary quantities without any
physical meaning except the highest occupied one. [3] However, it is clear that DFT is also
a legitimate route to the study of excited state properties via perturbation theory [4] or
time-dependent DFT. [5,6] Especially, G¨orling has recently formulated a KS formalism for
excited states based on DFT perturbation theory and demonstrated that the KS eigenvalue
diﬀerence is a well-deﬁned zeroth order approximation to excitation energies. [7] This has
been also explicitly conﬁrmed for several atoms by accurate quantum Monte-Carlo (QMC)
calculations. [8,9]

It appears that - at least for localized systems - the unrealistic description of eigenvalue
spectra is mainly due to the deﬁciencies of the conventional approximations for the exchange-
correlation energy functional such as the LDA or GGA rather than the KS scheme itself.
The origin of these deﬁciencies is now more or less understood from the investigations of
the exact properties of the KS exchange-correlation potential V KS
xc which the LDA or GGA
does not satisfy: (i) V KS
for ﬁnite systems, [10,11] (ii) the eigenvalue
of the highest occupied single particle states is the negative of the ionization energy, [10,12]
(iii) V KS
xc (r) exhibits an integer discontinuity upon
the addition of an electron. [13,14] However, it has been recognized that approximations to
the local KS potential obtained from the orbital dependent exact exchange energy functional
through the so-called optimized eﬀective potential (OEP) method [15,16] closely observe
these conditions. [17,18]

xc (r) is self-interaction free, and (iv) V KS

In spite of these good features, the implementation of the OEP method is very com-
plicated and its computational cost is excessively high. Only spherical atoms, [16,17,19]
jellium surfaces, [20] jellium spheres, [21] and periodic solids with a small unit cell [22] have
been extensively studied, and there exists no investigation of molecular systems with the
OEP method. However, about a decade ago, Krieger, Li, and Iafrate (KLI) proposed an
approximation scheme to the OEP, and have shown that the KLI potential with the exact
exchange-only energy functional (KLI-x) satisﬁes the above mentioned properties (i)-(iv)
of V KS
, and accurately reproduces the OEP-x results for spherical atoms. [18] Within the
xc
KLI-x approximation, the workload in constructing the potential is signiﬁcantly reduced,
but this method is still relatively complicated compared with the LDA or GGA and studies
are therefore limited. Atomic systems have been originally investigated by KLI, [18] and
more recently by Grabo et al. [23] Bylander and Kleinman studied semiconductors with the
KLI potential. [24] Although molecules are a very good testing ground of any functional
approximation, only some diatomic molecules have been investigated by Grabo et al. [23]

In this article, we report a study of several closed shell diatomic and polyatomic molecules
within the KLI scheme. The questions we address are the performance of the KLI approxi-
mation to the OEP with the exact exchange-only functional (KLI-x) and supplemented by
LDA and Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof GGA [25] correlation energy functionals (KLI-x+LDA-c

2

and KLI-x+GGA-c) for both structural properties and eigenvalue spectra. The comparison
with and qualitative diﬀerences from the LDA/GGA and the Hartree-Fock (HF) method
will be emphasized. In addition, since we incorporate the exact exchange, we can examine
the accuracy of the LDA and GGA correlation energy functionals. The underlying com-
putational algorithm is the three-dimensional (3D) ﬁnite-diﬀerence pseudopotential method
[26,27] and, to our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst 3D KLI investigation of molecular systems.

The organization of the paper is as follows. In Sec. II, the formulation of KLI is reviewed
and the diﬀerences of the KLI-x from the HF method will be emphasized. The implementa-
tion of KLI-x into our molecular code and its test results are described. In Sec. III, results
and discussions for several molecules will be presented for both structural properties and
eigenvalue spectra. Especially, comparisons between the KLI-x and the LDA/GGA or HF
method are made, and physical origins of these diﬀerences will be discussed. In Sec. IV, we
conclude the paper by summarizing our work and future prospects.

σNσ is the HF orbital energy expression evaluated with the KS (rather than HF)

At this point, we would like to emphasize that the KLI-x KS scheme yields a local
potential, while the HF method gives a nonlocal exchange potential. It is well known that
the HF method gives eigenfunctions and eigenvalues for the unoccupied orbitals which are
inappropriate for describing actual excited states, because HF unoccupied orbitals do not
have self-interaction corrections. [29] This point will be further emphasized and discussed in
Sec. III B with speciﬁc examples.

B. Computational Methods

All the calculations in this work are based on the ﬁnite-diﬀerence pseudopotential scheme
[26] which we have previously applied to the study of neutral and charged water clusters. [27]
In this formulation, quantities such as KS orbitals, densities, and potentials are expressed
on grids in a rectangular simulation box, and the Laplacians or gradients are evaluated
by higher-order ﬁnite-diﬀerence expressions. The most computationally demanding step

gate gradient method using a higher-order (typically 13 points along each direction) ﬁnite-
diﬀerence method. Conjugate gradient relaxation steps have been performed until the error
is decreased to below 10−3. For the preconditioning, a smoothing type

is more appropriate, which should be understandable considering that the KLI-x potential

To assess the accuracy of our 3D KLI-x implementation, we considered atoms and com-
pared LDA and KLI-x results with those from an accurate 1D radial atomic code. One test
was for an Appelbaum-Hamann type local pseudopotential [33] modiﬁed to bind 5 electrons

This choice was made to reconcile the limitations of the 3D code that it can deal with
only smooth pseudopotentials and the 1D code that it can only produce accurate results for
spherical atoms because of the central ﬁeld approximation. Using a grid spacing h = 0.4
a.u., simulation cell length L = 32 a.u., and ﬁnite-diﬀerence order 13, we obtained agreement
10−3 a.u./atom for both LDA and KLI-x total energies. For the

in the next section (C, N, and O), we generated LDA pseudopotentials with the method of
Troullier and Martins [35] and compared LDA total energies and eigenvalues from the two
codes. With h = 0.25 a.u., the 3D code reproduced the 1D atomic total energy with an
accuracy of

10−3 a.u./atom which is suﬃcient for our purpose.

Before closing this section, we would like to comment on the issues involved with the use
of pseudopotentials. Although the rigorous and consistent procedure would be to employ
pseudopotentials generated within the same functional approximations, we used LDA gener-
ated pseudopotentials to carry out all other functional calculations for two reasons. First, we
believe this procedure will not change the qualitative picture, since structural and electronic

properties are rather insensitive on the nature of the exchange-correlation energy functional
that is used for the small 1s cores of the ﬁrst-row atoms considered here. [36] Second, we
note ambiguities associated with pseudopotential generation procedures. For example, we
observed a small but sharp peak at the atomic center in the PBE GGA pseudopoential,
which caused a serious convergence problem. [32] Moreover, in the KLI-x pseudopotential
generation, there is an intrinsic problem of slow decaying tails due to the nonlocal nature of
the exact exchange functional that somewhat inﬂuences the results. [24,37] These anoma-
lous behaviors can be only alleviated by some post-processings which introduce additional
arbitrariness in pseudopotenials. [24,32]

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

A. Structural properties

We ﬁrst examine the structural properties of H2, CO, N2, H2O, and CH4 given in
Table I and Table II. The binding energies EB, equilibrium bond lengths re, and vibrational
frequencies ωe of the diatomic molecules were determined from the total energy versus bond-
length curves by ﬁtting to the ﬁve parameter (De, re, ωe, a, and b) Hulburt-Hirschfelder
function, [38,39]

V (r) = De [(1

(19)

where x = r
re and re and De are the equilibrium distance and bonding energy, using
the simulated annealing method. [40] The geometries of the polyatomic molecules have been
optimized by employing Hellmann-Feynman quantum forces. A grid spacing h = 0.25 a.u.
has been used for all the molecular calculations. For the calculation of binding energies, the
energies of each pseudoatom and molecules have been calculated by the same method and
with the same h. We expect this procedure will result in a systematic cancellation of errors,
and in addition we may treat the atom without central ﬁeld approximation.

Our LDA and GGA results are essentially a reproduction of previous studies. [41–43]
The LDA consistently overestimates the stability of the molecules and the GGA typically
cures this tendency of overestimation to a large extent. The HF approximation on the
other hand substantially underestimates the binding energy. [39,44] Bond lengths calculated
by the LDA are usually overestimated and one obtains corresponding underestimations of
vibrational frequencies for the diatomic molecules. The HF method gives the opposite
behavior. The KLI-x approximation typically gives similar results as HF for the structural
properties which are mostly determined by the total energy functional. [44] It is well known
that the HF method gives the wrong sign of the dipole moment of CO, and the LDA corrects
this. Again, the KLI-x calculation yields the wrong sign of the dipole moment of CO in
agreement with the HF method. The diﬀerence between magnitudes of the KLI-x and HF
dipole moment of CO results from the fact that the HF value has been evaluated at the
experimental bond length. Our KLI-x calculation at the experimental bond length gave

0.275 Debye.

−

The addition of an LDA or GGA correlation energy functional to the exact exchange
energy gives mixed results: Binding energies are increased, hence improved the KLI-x values,

7

but bond lengths are decreased and become worse. So, we can conclude that the two
correlation functional approximations do not give systematic improvements over the exact
exchange energy functional, which indicates that these approximations are not accurate
descriptions of correlation eﬀects in molecules.

B. KS Eigenvalues and Excitations

In Fig. 1, we compare the LDA-xc and KLI-x potentials of H2 to reemphasize the
diﬀerent nature of the exchange(-correlation) potentials from the two methods. While the
1/r
LDA-xc potential decays exponentially, the KLI-x potential reproduces the correct
asymptotic behavior, and this causes marked diﬀerences in the eigenvalue spectra. This
1/r decay property lets the high-lying KS unoccupied eigenvalues correctly approach a
−
Rydberg series, and is also important for other properties that are sensitive to the outer
part of the charge density, such as polarizabilities.

−

Eigenvalues of the highest occupied orbitals of the molecules considered in the previous
section at their equilibrium geometries (Tables I and II) are listed in Table III. Compared
with the LDA or GGA, the KLI-x values agree very well with experimental ionization po-

approximation to the ionization potential via Koopman’s theorem due to the fact that omis-
sion of correlation tends to be cancelled by the neglect of relaxation in the “frozen orbital”
approximation. [44] On the other hand, in the exact DFT, the highest occupied orbital
eigenvalue equals the ionization potential without any relaxation correction [10,12] as we
typically see in our KLI-x calculations, hence, in principle DFT should yield highest occu-
pied orbital eigenvalues in better agreement with experimental ionization potentials than
HF. However, in the usual LDA or GGA, the highest occupied eigenvalues are in serious
errors due to the wrong decay property of exchange-correlation potential exempliﬁed in Fig.
1. The errors are about 0.2 a.u. for the molecules we have studied as shown in Table III.
On the other hand, due to Eq. (17), KLI-x should give highest occupied orbital eigenvalues
in good agreement with experimental ionization potentials when HF values also agree with
experimental ionization potential. The addition of LDA or GGA correlation potentials to
the KLI-x potential usually lowers KLI-x highest occupied orbital eigenvalues, but this leads
to too large ionization potentials.

Among the molecules examined in this work, N2 is a particularly interesting case which
shows the advantage and disadvantage of the KLI-x scheme at the same time. First, note
that the HF results are in qualitative disagreement with experiment: it puts the 1πu state
higher than 3σg state as the highest occupied orbital in contrast to the experimental data.
This incorrect ordering of the ﬁrst two ionization potentials is a well-known example of the
breakdown of the HF picture and indicates a large eﬀect of correlation upon the orbitals in
N2. [44] On the other hand note that KLI-x gives the correct ordering of the two orbitals,
which implies that the local nature of the KLI-x potential can make a diﬀerence even for the
occupied-orbital eigenvalue spectrum. The fact that the LDA also gives the correct ordering
(although the value is worse than the KLI-x one due to the above-mentioned reasons) shows
that there are cases where the local potential in the KS scheme is superior to the nonlocal
is equal to ǫHF ′
HF potential. The highest occupied state in the KLI-x scheme ǫKLI−x

[according to Eq. (17)] which results in the biggest KLI-x error among the molecules studied

since this also has the largest HF error. Better quantitative agreement with experiment can
be obtained by incorporating the correlations, e.g. through many-body perturbation type
approach. [44]

In addition to the eigenvalues of the highest occupied orbitals, we have also examined
eigenvalue diﬀerences between the highest occupied and the lowest unoccupied orbitals,
which are compared with experimental lowest triplet and singlet vertical excitation energies
in Table IV. First, we point out that the HF calculations give positive orbital energies for
all the virtual orbitals in the molecules considered here. [39,44] This is because unoccupied
orbitals in HF do not really correspond to excited states of the system, in which the excited
state electron would have been removed from one of the lower states and acted on by N
1
remaining electrons, [29] but rather the bound states (if any) of the singly-charged negative
ion, in which the extra electron sees the ﬁeld due to other N electrons. [39] To make this
argument more explicit, we follow Slater [45] and rewrite Eqs. (9) and (10) (now using the

P
On the other hand, in DFT, as mentioned in Sec. I, diﬀerences of KS eigenvalues are well-
deﬁned approximations for excitation energies. [7] Umrigar et al. have conﬁrmed that this
is the case for several atomic systems by showing that the exact KS eigenvalue diﬀerences
obtained from KS potentials derived from accurate QMC densities almost always lie between
the triplet and singlet experimental excitation energies. [8] They further claimed that this
is because of the fact that, in addition to the well known exact properties of V KS
(Sec. I),
V KS
not only up to 1/r but up to
xc
order 1/r4 inclusive. However, in the LDA or GGA, no bound unoccupied state exists in
many cases, due to the shallow nature of the corresponding exchange-correlation potentials.
We can expect that the KLI-x is a much better approximation than the LDA/GGA, since
1/r behavior. Our KLI-x results
it satisﬁes Eq.
indeed always give negative virtual orbital eigenvalues for the studied molecules and also
show good agreement with experimental values. The single exception is H2O in which the
diﬀerence between the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied orbital eigenvalues is bigger
0.07 a.u. Further detailed

Assuming that the diﬀerences between the HF and OEP-x orbitals are negligible, we can
see that HF orbital eigenvalue diﬀerences are much bigger than OEP-x values, because the

IV. CONCLUSIONS

In this work, we have studied structural and excitation properties of small molecules
using the KLI approximation to the OEP with the exact exchange energy functional only
(KLI-x) and augmented by LDA and GGA correlation functionals. For structural properties,
the KLI-x gave comparable results to those of the HF method. For excitation properties,
the KLI-x results in good eigenvalue spectra for both the highest occupied and unoccupied
orbitals, since it has the correct asymptotic large r behavior of V KS
unlike the LDA or
GGA. Especially, we ﬁnd that unoccupied orbital eigenvalues are better described by KLI-x
than by HF, which illustrates the advantage of the KS scheme in general.

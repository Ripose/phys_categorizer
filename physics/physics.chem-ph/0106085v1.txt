Two-photon absorption (TPA) spectra of push-pull chromophores are described in terms of a
two-state model accounting for electron-vibration coupling. Vibrations have two main eﬀects in
TPA spectra. The most obvious one is the appearance of a vibrational structure in the spectrum;
in this respect we ﬁnd large Herzberg-Teller contributions. The second eﬀect was not recognized so
far: vibrational states contribute a new channel to TPA process, that shows up with a blue-shift
and a distortion of the spectrum. Vibrational-channel contributions to other NLO responses are
shortly discussed.

I. INTRODUCTION

The large non-linear optical (NLO) responses that characterize π-conjugated materials make them good candidates
for innovative applications. Among other properties, large two-photon absorption (TPA) cross-sections are promis-
ing for diﬀerent applications, ranging from optical storage to biological optical imaging1. As a consequence, both
experimental and theoretical work2–7 have received strong impetus and several interesting strategies have been pro-
posed to improve NLO responses in general8,9 and TPA cross-section in particular1,10. A presently highly debated
topic concerns the importance of vibrational contributions to NLO responses of organic materials11–14. The cou-
pling of electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom (e-ph coupling) is very important in conjugated molecules and
polymers15 and is expected to originate large eﬀects in systems with intrinsically non-linear behavior16–18. General
agreement is presently emerging about the importance of vibronic contributions to static NLO responses in conjugated
materials11,12,16–18. This can be easily understood: the static applied electric ﬁelds aﬀect the electronic properties
of the chromophore by aﬀecting its π-electron distribution. Due to e-ph coupling, the applied ﬁelds then also act
on the vibrational states by displacing nuclei, and this in turn reﬂects on the electronic distribution, in a feedback
mechanism that ampliﬁes non-linearity16.

The situation is much more complex at optical frequencies. A fairly common statement is that nuclei are too
massive to respond at optical frequencies, so that their contribution to NLO responses is irrelevant.
In a recent
paper13, negligible vibrational contributions to non-resonant NLO responses have been demonstrated. Whereas for
actual molecules with electronic excitation energies of the order of 1-2 eV and vibrational energies of about 0.1-0.2 eV
it is diﬃcult to ﬁnd out a frequency range far enough from both electronic and vibrational resonances as to safely apply
the approximations in Ref.13, one indeed does not expect really large eﬀects of e-ph coupling in truly non-resonant NLO
responses14. As far as resonant processes are concerned, however, the above statement does not apply. Quite obviously
it leads to erroneous conclusions if applied to incoherent measurements, i.e. to experiments where a ‘prepared’ state
is allowed to relax for some time before further processing. Just as an example, we have already proved large and
non-trivial eﬀects of the coupling between electronic and slow degrees of freedom in time-resolved ﬂuorescence19 and
femtosecond hole-burning spectra20 of push-pull chromophores. But also in coherent resonant experiments (one- and
two-photon absorption being simple examples) e-ph coupling is important. Just as in one-photon absorption (OPA)
spectra, also in non-linear spectra e-ph coupling is responsible for structured, vibronically resolved band-shapes.
Large eﬀects of e-ph coupling have been recognized within the Condon approximation in TPA spectra of push-pull
chromophores2, and, within the same approximation, TPA, third harmonic generation (THG) and non-degenerate
four-wave mixing spectra of the conjugated polymer polydiacetylene have been shown to be non-trivially aﬀected by
e-ph coupling15. Recent ab initio calculations of TPA spectra of a few conjugated molecules5,6 showed sizable and, in

some cases even large, Herzberg-Teller (HT) corrections, demonstrating once more the non-trivial role of e-ph coupling
in conjugated systems.

The eﬀects of e-ph coupling in NLO spectra calculated within the Condon and HT approximations are important
and have to be included in any reliable spectral simulation. However they are not dissimilar in principle from standard
eﬀects in linear absorption spectra. In fact, within Condon and HT schemes, e-ph coupling only leads to a partitioning
of the oscillator strength of a given electronic transition into several vibronic states, or occasionally (within HT) to
a borrowing of intensity from an allowed transition to a forbidden one. Of course the spectral consequences of
these well-known phenomena will be more and more complex and important the higher is the order of non-linearity,
and the larger is the number of coupled electronic states involved in the process15. But in non-linear spectra e-ph
coupling can have much more peculiar eﬀects with no counterpart in linear absorption.
In conjugated materials
e-ph coupling is responsible for the appearance in infrared and/or Raman spectra of vibrational bands with large
(sometimes really huge) intensities11,15,21. Then there are vibrational states, to mean states within the ground state
vibrational manifold, that have large transition dipole moments and/or transition (Raman) polarizabilities. These
states, if properly included in sum over states (SOS) expressions of NLO susceptibilities, provide an important purely
vibrational channel to NLO responses, that adds to the standard electronic channel. Vibrational channel contributions
to resonant NLO processes have not been recognized so far: here we demonstrate they can strongly aﬀect the spectral
properties of π-conjugated systems.

In the next Section we will concentrate on TPA spectra of push-pull chromophores described in terms of the simplest
relevant model, the DA dimer with Holstein coupling16. Within this model we are able to calculate numerically exact
TPA spectra. We can then discuss the reliability of Condon and HT approximation schemes. We ﬁnd sizable HT
corrections to TPA spectra even for systems whose OPA spectra are well reproduced within the Condon approxima-
tion. Even more importantly, we demonstrate large contributions of the vibrational channel to TPA spectra. These
contributions become dominant in the cyanine limit.
In the discussion Section we extend the treatment to other
non-linear techniques and shortly address the behavior of diﬀerent π-conjugated systems.

II. TPA SPECTRA OF THE DA DIMER WITH HOLSTEIN COUPLING

where Q and P are the coordinate and momentum for a harmonic vibration with frequency ωv; σz and σx are the
Pauli spin operators; 2z0 is the energy gap at Q = 0; ˆρ = (1

Hamiltonian assigns the two non-interacting (√2t = 0) states two harmonic potential energy surfaces (PES), as shown
in Fig. 1a. Following Mulliken, we assume orthogonal basis states and neglect all dipole moment matrix elements but
, so that the dipole moment operator can be written as: ˆµ = µ0 ˆρ16.
µ0 =
i

When the interaction is switched on (without loss of generality we set √2t = 1) the two states mix, and, in the
adiabatic approximation, the ground and excited state PES, shown in Fig. 1b, are easily obtained by diagonalizing
the relevant two-dimensional matrix as a function of Q. As a consequence of e-ph coupling, i.e. of the relative
displacement of the PES in Fig. 1a, the energy gap between the two basis states varies with Q, so that the amount
of mixing between the two states, measured by ρ =
) and excited
G
, also depends on Q. Then, both the ground (
ˆρ
i
|
i
h
) wavefunctions depend on Q, and analytical expressions for the Q-dependent properties (energies, dipole

moments, etc.) are easily obtained. In particular the energies of both states show a non-parabolic dependence on
Q, i.e. the two corresponding PES are anharmonic (Fig. 1b). This anharmonicity induced by e-ph coupling has
large eﬀects on static NLO responses22, where high order Q-derivatives of the ground state PES are involved. It also
strongly aﬀects incoherent spectral measurements where the system tests large regions of the ground and/or excited
state PES23. On the opposite, anharmonicity is not expected to show up in vertical processes22 like OPA or TPA.

In any case, the analytical expressions for the ground and excited state PES allow for an exact solution of the
corresponding vibrational problems. A detailed description of the adiabatic solution of the Hamiltonian in Eq. (1) is
deferred to a subsequent publication24. Basically, chosen a harmonic phonon basis to describe the vibrational problem
on either surfaces, the corresponding Hamiltonian matrices are easily written down by expanding the relevant electronic
energies in powers of Q. Numerically exact vibrational eigenstates are then obtained provided that both the phonon
basis and the Q-expansion are truncated at a suﬃciently high order as to get convergence on the evaluated properties.

on the relevant exact anharmonic vibrational eigenstates. For the calculations presented in this paper, we chose
to describe the vibrational problem in either the ground or excited state PES on the basis of the eigenstates of a
harmonic oscillator with frequency ωv, centered at the minimum of the ground state PES. With this choice we found
that
20 basis states and a similar number of terms in the Q-expansion of the electronic energies and/or dipole
moments are more than enough to get convergence. We underline that the adiabatic approximation we adopt in the
present treatment is very useful since it allows for a clear separation between states in the G- and E- manifolds, and
then to distinguish between vibrational and vibronic excitations. The two kinds of states are completely mixed up in
a truly non-adiabatic system. In any case, as far as the results presented in this paper are concerned, the reliability of
the adiabatic approximation has been conﬁrmed by the comparison with exact non-adiabatic results, obtained along
the lines presented in Ref.22.

push-pull chromophores, a typical value for √2t is
read in eV. We present results obtained for three diﬀerent z0 values, to model chromophores with a very low polarity
(z0 = 0.95, ρ = 0.2), with intermediate polarity (z0 = 0.66, ρ = 0.35) and just in the cyanine limit (z0 = 0.50,
ρ = 0.5). We notice that the properties of the system are symmetric with respect to the substitution ρ
ρ. The
upper panels in Fig. 2 report one-photon absorption (OPA) spectra: exact spectra (continuous lines) are compared
to those obtained in the Condon (dotted lines) and HT (dashed lines) approximation schemes. Both Condon and HT
schemes work within the harmonic approximation, and we calculate Condon and HT spectra in the best harmonic
approximation22 for the ground and excited state PES, i.e. by truncating the expansion of the corresponding potential
energies, around the ground state equilibrium position, up to the second order in Q. In the Condon approximation,
the expansion of µCT (Q) is truncated at the zeroth order (constant) term, whereas in the HT approximation the
linear term in the expansion of the numerator of χ(1) is also accounted for. As it turns out from Fig. 2, both Condon
and HT approximations are fairly good for OPA spectra. The minor deviations of HT from Condon spectra are
irrelevant in the fairly broad spectra usually observed for polar chromophores in solution. Quite predictably, the
harmonic approximation works well to describe vertical electronic processes22, and HT (and higher order) corrections
to Condon spectra turn out small for allowed transitions.

Even accounting for just the electronic channel to TPA absorption, we can already stress the importance of a proper
modeling of e-ph coupling in TPA spectra. If e-ph coupling is not accounted for, both OPA and TPA spectra have a
single Lorentzian shape, and are exactly superimposed if the TPA frequency scale is expanded by a factor of 2 with
respect to the OPA scale. At the Condon level, the situation is not very diﬀerent: e-ph coupling originates structured
bands in both OPA and TPA spectra, but with similar shape, so that the two spectra are essentially superimposable
as in the absence of coupling. An obvious deviation is observed at ρ = 0.5, where, in the harmonic approximation,
2ρ in the dimer model. At variance
the TPA spectrum exactly vanishes due to the factor µE −
with OPA spectra, however, HT corrections are very important in TPA, at least for not too neutral molecules. For
ρ = 0.35, the HT spectrum in the central panel of Fig.2 has a qualitatively diﬀerent shape from the Condon spectrum,
with the 0-1 line acquiring intensity at the expense of the 0-0 line. Apart from the pathological ρ = 0.5 case, the HT
approach oﬀers a good approximation to the electronic channel contribution to TPA, conﬁrming the reliability of the
harmonic approximation to describe vertical electronic processes22.

Up to now we have only considered the electronic channel contribution to TPA process, where e-ph coupling mainly
contributes in deﬁning vibronically structured band-proﬁles. We already got a fairly impressive result: the Condon
approximation to TPA spectra is in general inadequate, even in cases where it works well for OPA spectra. However
in TPA spectra, and more generally in non-linear spectra, vibrations have a much more important role than simply
structuring the observed band-shapes. They in fact open a vibrational channel to non-linear processes. The lower
panels in Fig. 2 show the total TPA spectrum, obtained from the imaginary part of χT P A in Eq. (3), by allowing m
and n indices to run on both vibrational and vibronic excitations. The comparison between continuous lines in the
middle and lowest panels in Fig.2 clearly demonstrates the importance of the vibrational channel to TPA process,
with sizable eﬀects on the absorption frequency, on the band-shape as well as on the total intensity. Overall, the
vibrational channel increases the intensity of higher vibronic replicas at the expense of the lowest replicas, with eﬀects
that are most important at ρ
0.4. This implies a blue-shift of the TPA spectrum if compared with the rescaled
OPA spectrum. In the extreme case of ρ = 0.5, the blue-shift amounts to a vibrational spacing. Intensity eﬀects are
negligible for ρ
0.2, but at ρ = 0.35 the vibrational channel ampliﬁes TPA response by a 1.2 factor, that becomes
∼
a factor of 4 in the ρ = 0.5 case.

III. DISCUSSION

Vibrational channel contributions to TPA process arise from terms in Eq. (3) where m or n, or both m and n run on

appears, where v is one of the vibrational states in the G-manifold. The square of this term measures the absorption
intensity of the v-th vibrational state. Since the fundamental vibration has by far the largest IR intensity22, the
vibrational channel to TPA is dominated by it. A ﬁrst approximation to χvib

The solution of the two-state model in the adiabatic approximation allows for reliable estimates of the relative
magnitude of electronic and vibrational contributions to TPA spectra and even more importantly oﬀers a natural
understanding of the physical origin of the diﬀerent contributions. An obvious drawback of the two-state model is
however the impossibility to account for the role of highly excited states. Of course, extending the sums in Eq. (3) to
excited states (E′) higher than the lowest one (E) opens additional channels to the TPA process. These E′-channel
contributions to TPA have m or n or both m and n in Eq. (3) running over vibronic states pertaining to the E′-

0.2 eV, in fairly good agreement with previous estimates on a similar
dye (coumarin 102)19. Based on these data, the vibrational and E′-channel contributions to TPA spectra turn out of
the same order of magnitude. In view of the fairly low polarity of coumarin 153 and of its fairly high ωCT frequency,
we believe that for most push-pull chromophores the vibrational channel contribution to TPA spectra is larger than
E′-channel contributions. In fact, preliminary ZINDO calculations on a few chromophores conﬁrm that, at least for
chromophores with intermediate polarity (ρ
0.7), the vibrational contributions to TPA spectra are important
and cannot be disregarded with respect to E′-channel contributions. Reﬁned models for NLO responses accounting
for plenty of excited states are bound to fail if no proper account is given for the contributions of vibrational states.
Besides TPA spectra, other NLO responses can be aﬀected by the vibrational channel. Fig. 3 shows the amplitude
ωCT /3, for three diﬀerent ρ values. Continuous lines
of the third harmonic generation (THG) signal in the region ω
refer to the total response, obtained by allowing the triple sums in χT HG = χ(3)(
3ω; ω, ω, ω) to run on both vibronic
and vibrational excitations. Dashed lines instead account for the electronic channel to THG, obtained by summing
only on vibronic states. The vibrational channel strongly aﬀects THG response, with largest eﬀects at ρ
0.3, where
the response is ampliﬁed by a factor
2 in the shown spectral region. Calculations are performed using the complete
expression for χT HG, but, in the portion of the spectrum shown in the ﬁgure, the terms with a resonating denominator
are clearly dominant, so that we can approximate χT HG as follows:

but the importance of Raman modes is suggested by the observation of the maximum vibrational contribution to
0.3, where the non-resonant Raman intensity maximizes for the DA dimer model29.
THG just at ρ
Having rationalized the vibrational channel contributions to TPA and THG spectra of the DA dimer model in
terms of IR and non-resonant Raman intensity of coupled vibrations, we can shortly extend our discussion to diﬀerent
systems. In conjugated polymers the coupled vibrations are not IR active, whereas they have huge (non-resonant)
Raman intensities11,15. Then we expect no contribution from the vibrational channel in TPA spectra of pristine
polymers, whereas the vibrational contributions to THG spectra can be important. A detailed description of NLO
properties of polymers is diﬃcult, in view of their fairly crowded excitation spectra. Preliminary results on a simple
relevant model, the self-dimer with Peierls coupling30, conﬁrm large vibrational channel contributions to THG spectra,
and negligible contributions to TPA spectra. Of course large vibrational contributions to TPA spectra can be expected
for doped or photoexcited polymer samples, based on the very large IR intensities associated with charged solitonic
or polaronic defects15,21.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

In conjugated molecules and polymers e-ph coupling is very eﬀective. It shows up with largely anharmonic PES,
that, in conjugated polymers, often show more than a single minimum31 to signal the Peierls instability. A second
fairly ubiquitous consequence of e-ph coupling is the large nuclear displacement upon electronic excitation, with
well apparent eﬀects in absorption and resonant Raman spectra9,15,19,26,29.
In systems with large e-ph coupling,
static electric ﬁelds can draw nuclei out of equilibrium, and this is the basic reason why e-ph coupling is so eﬀective
in amplifying static NLO responses via anharmonic contributions22. Fields at optical frequencies are too fast to
displace nuclei, but in incoherent measurements nuclei are allowed to relax for a while following the application of the
preparation pulses: once more e-ph coupling is important in deﬁning the shape of the involved PES20,23. Electron-
phonon coupling largely aﬀects vibrational spectra, with a softening of the relevant modes and a large increase of
infrared and/or Raman intensities. Therefore in SOS expressions for the susceptibilities, vibrational states can give
large contributions. For static susceptibilities this contribution indeed accounts for the anharmonicity of the ground
state PES22,24.

As far as resonant processes are concerned, the importance of the vibrational contributions has not been fully
appreciated so far. Here we have analyzed TPA spectra of the DA dimer model — the simplest model relevant to
push-pull chromophores — and proved that the vibrational contribution is very important in deﬁning the shape,
frequency and intensity of the signal. Including vibrational degrees of freedom has two major eﬀects in TPA spectra,
and more generally in resonant NLO processes. The ﬁrst, fairly obvious, eﬀect is the appearance of a vibronic structure
in TPA spectra. This eﬀect was already recognized2,6,9,15; here we prove the validity of the harmonic approximation
in this context, but the inadequacy of the Condon approximation. Speciﬁcally, HT corrections to TPA spectra are
important even in cases when OPA spectra are well reproduced within the Condon approximation. The second eﬀect
of vibrations is more interesting and has not been recognized so far. Vibrational states in the ground state manifold
in fact contribute a new and important channel to TPA process. The vibrational channel contribution shows up
with a blue-shift of the TPA spectrum with respect to the rescaled OPA spectrum and with a large distortion of the
TPA band-shape. These contributions are related to simple spectroscopic observables as inferred from vibrational
and linear absorption spectra. This immediately leads to safe predictions about other systems. As a matter of fact,
vibrational channel contributions to TPA spectra are related to the IR intensity of coupled modes, so that they are
expected to be negligible in any polymer (but possibly dominant in doped and/or photoexcited polymers). THG
spectra instead have contributions from Raman modes, so that large eﬀects of e-ph coupling are expected in THG
spectra of conjugated polymers.

The behavior of conjugated materials can only be understood by properly accounting for e-ph coupling, that aﬀects
in diﬀerent ways and for diﬀerent reasons the spectral properties of these systems. Common beliefs based on the
behavior of other systems where e-ph coupling is not so eﬀective, and/or extrapolated from our knowledge of their
linear spectroscopic behavior need to be carefully reconsidered. A joint experimental and theoretical eﬀort is needed
to extract the correct physics out of these fascinating materials.

Abstract

Department of Physics and JILA, University of Colorado, Boulder, Colorado 80309-0440

In the context of damage to DNA by low-energy electrons, we carry out calculations of electron

scattering from tetrahydrofuran and phosphoric acid, models of the subunits in the DNA backbone,

as a ﬁrst step in simulating the electron capture process that occurs in the cell. In the case of

tetrahydrofuran, we also compare with previous theoretical and experimental data. A comparison

of the shape of the resonant structures to virtual orbitals is also performed to gain insight into the

systematic connections with electron scattering from similar molecules and dissociative electron

attachment experiments.

INTRODUCTION

In the past few years, a growing literature has emerged, concerning the damage to nucleic

acids by low energy electrons1,2,3,4 produced by ionizing radiation. The process follows the

creation of thousands of low energy electrons, stripped oﬀ from molecules in the cell either

directly by the radiation or else by its ﬁrst products, highly energetic primary electrons, that

can cause electron-impact ionization. It has been shown that a majority of the secondary

electrons have an energy distribution between 0 and 20 eV.5 If the electron energy is higher

than the ionization threshold for DNA (between 7.85 and 9.4 eV, as measured for the DNA

bases6), then the nucleic acid can be ionized and damage produced through the subsequent

rearrangement and dissociation of the cation.7 If the electron energy is lower, though, damage

can still be generated through a negative anion-mediated mechanism, which starts with the

capture of the electron in a molecular resonance, followed by a transfer of energy and electron

density towards a weak bond that subsequently ruptures. Beyond this generally accepted

framework, there are many controversial issues. These issues concern the location of the

initial capture site,1 the dynamics of the metastable anion generated by electron capture and

the identiﬁcation of the ﬁnal bond that ruptures.2,8 The ﬁrst question is generally answered

saying that since the DNA bases have extended conjugated systems, they also have many

unoccupied π∗ orbitals, which in turn will give rise to low energy shape resonances.

In a previous article, we have explored the resonances that arise in electron scattering

from each of the RNA and DNA bases.9 In the present study, we analyze the behavior of the

other subunits in the macromolecule, with the aim of investigating the electron interaction

with the moieties that constitute the sugar-phosphate backbone, and verify whether they

could play a role in the electron capture stage of the process, In any case, it has been shown10

2

that low energy electrons can damage the DNA sugar, deoxyribose (2-deoxy-D-ribose), and

this interaction could be important in the cell environment. To model the sugar, we use

tetrahydrofuran (THF, whose formula is C4H8O), which is similar to deoxyribose, except

that the latter has -OH groups attached to the C1 and C3 and a CH2OH side chain attached

to the C4 (the latter two substituents are linked to a phosphate group in the DNA molecule,

while the former is linked to a base), they are substituted here by hydrogens. We use THF

instead of deoxyribose because in DNA the OH groups are fundamentally modiﬁed by the

phosphate and base that are attached to it (in fact the one attached to the C1 disappears

altogether), so we think that the solution would be either to consider a whole nucleotide or

use THF which mimics only the ring structure, which is less aﬀected by the rest. Another

reason for this choice is that a recent study on dissociative electron attachment (DEA) from

all the DNA components11 has measured the average gas-phase DEA cross section from the

bases as being very similar to the cross section per base for supercoiled DNA measured in

Ref. 12. This implies the DEA cross section for the sugar and phosphate groups to be much

smaller, which is what happens in the case of THF, but not for a hydroxy-substituted THF,

for which the DEA cross section is larger than for the bases. This suggests that THF could

be a better molecule to model the sugar moiety in DNA. The structures of these compounds

are represented schematically in Figs. 1, 2. In practice, the DNA backbone can be thought

of approximately as constituted by THF molecules to which the bases are attached, linked

together by phosphate groups.

For the phosphate there are no previous results available for comparison, but for THF

recently there have been both new experimental13,14 and theoretical15 results, with which we

will compare our calculations. We will also attempt a comparison of the resonant wavefunc-

tions to virtual orbitals from a Hartree-Fock calculation, in order to gain some more insights

3

into the capture process and its possible consequences on the anion evolution. The conclu-

sions suggested by this analysis lead us to draw a possible link between our calculations and

experimental data on dissociative electron attachment .

II. THEORY

Electron scattering from a polyatomic molecule is intrinsically a many-body problem

that can, under the so-called static-exchange approximation,16 be reduced to a one electron

problem. The static-exchange approximation amounts to including only the ground state

of the target in the close coupling expansion of the wave function, and it is essentially the

equivalent of the Hartree-Fock approximation for continuum states.17 A detailed description

of our method can be found in Refs. 9,18,19, therefore here we will just sketch the main

points of the treatment.

To solve this one electron problem,18 we use the R-matrix method which starts by par-

titioning space into two zones: a short range zone where all the channels are coupled and

the scattering problem can in principle be treated in all its many body complexity, and an

outer zone (external to the target electron density) in which the escaping electron only sees

the eﬀect of the target molecule as a multipole expansion of its electrostatic potential. In

its eigenchannel form, the R-matrix method can be formulated as a variational principle20

for the normal logarithmic derivative (-b) of the wavefunction on the reaction zone surface:

b ≡ −∂log (rΨ)

= 2

∂r

RV Ψ∗(E − ˆH − ˆL)ΨdV
RV Ψ∗δ(r − r0)ΨdV

(1)

where ˆL is the Bloch operator, needed to make the Hamiltonian ˆH Hermitian and ro is

the boundary between the internal and external regions. It is possible, after expanding the

4

internal region wavefunction in a suitable basis set, to recast the solution of Eq. 1 as an

eigenvalue problem:

Γ ~C = 2(EO − H − L) ~C = Λ ~Cb,

(2)

where O is a matrix of volume overlap between the basis functions, while Λ is an overlap of

the basis functions on the surface of the internal zone,20 essentially the denominator of Eq.

1, and H, L are the matrix representations of the operators in Eq. 1. Through basis set

partitioning we shift the computational burden to the solution of a large linear system. As

a basis set we use ﬁnite elements21 in all three spherical coordinates, in this way we have

large but sparse matrices that are amenable for solution with fast sparse solvers.19,22

To simplify further the description of our system we have to deal with the nonlocality

inherent in the potential. To do this we use a local density approximation for the exchange

potential, which reduces it to a functional only of the local density:

where kF is the local Fermi momentum:

Vex(~r) = − 2
π

kF F (kF , E),

kF (~r) = [3π2ρ(~r)]1/3

(3)

(4)

and F is a functional of the energy and the local density ρ(~r) (through the local Fermi

momentum). The functional form we use for F is called the Hara exchange.23 It has been

extensively employed in continuum state calculations, and it is energy-dependent. The

local exchange approximation, widely used also in density functional (DFT) calculations,24

has proven itself to give qualitatively correct results,16,18 while being suﬃciently simple to

5

implement computationally that it permits an exploration of complex molecular species.

A polarization-correlation potential is added to this. The long range part of this potential

is a simple multipole expansion, of which we retain only the induced dipole polarization term:

Vpol = − α0
2r4

(5)

where α0 is the totally symmetric component of the polarizability tensor, and it can be

calculated ab initio using electronic structure codes. Exploratory tests suggest that the

anisotropic polarizability and the electron-quadrupole interaction are much less important.

For example the anisotropic part of the polarizability, when introduced generates a maximum

diﬀerence of 0.01 rad in the phase shifts, which in turn translates in a variation of the cross

section values of roughly 1%.

In the volume where the electronic density of the target is not negligible, this potential

is nonlocal. The polarization-correlation interaction can be approximated again as a local

potential, diﬀerent forms of which have been suggested in the literature. The one we use

is based on DFT (speciﬁcally on the LYP potential of Ref. 25) and it has yielded reliable

results in the work of Gianturco and coworkers.26 This form makes use of the electron density,

its gradient and Laplacian, which have to be calculated for each target molecule. The short

and long range potentials are matched unambiguously (continuously but with discontinuous

derivatives) at the innermost crossing point, whose radius is dependent on the angles. The

matching is unambiguous in the sense that there are two crossing points between the inner

and outer potential for each angle, and we always choose the innermost, since the other is

far in the region where the electron density of the molecule is very small. Choosing the

outermost crossing has proven to give unphysical results27 in many cases. In recent years,

6

better density functionals have been devised that give the quantities of interest more directly,

without the need for an additional polarization contribution, and they have been recently

used in connection with time-dependent DFT to calculate scattering observables.28

Since the molecules considered in this work possess dipole moments, we take dipole

interaction eﬀects into account in the manner described in Ref. 9. Recently we discovered

a mistake in our dipole matching code that led to an overestimation of the cross sections

in Fig. 3 of Ref. 9 of about 10% at very low energy, decreasing and becoming negligible

beyond about 10 eV, but its eﬀects on the other results in that work are negligible. The

quadrupole ﬁelds can potentially be signiﬁcant as well, but they are roughly half of the

dipole ﬁeld at the box boundary; accordingly, we did not include quadrupole interactions

outside the box, since their eﬀect was found to be small when analyzed using an R-matrix

propagation technique.29,30 The nonspherical part of the polarizability tensor is quite small

as well, roughly one fourth of the spherical part, and from previous calculations we have

seen how such values have only a minimal inﬂuence on the ﬁnal results; this too has been

neglected here.

For molecules with dipole moments the ﬁxed-nuclei scattering cross sections are formally

inﬁnite. This divergence can be readily eliminated by considering rotations of the molecule,

as a Born closure expansion.31 We have not implemented this here, as in our previous work

on the DNA bases, because this level of detail is not our present interest. Moreover, the

dipole moments here are also less than half what they were for the DNA and RNA bases, so

the correction will be even less important here. Therefore the cross sections we show should

be understood to include only up to a maximum electronic orbital angular momentum

lmax = 10, with all the higher partial waves omitted. We stress as well that since our model

does not include excited states of the target molecule, when the electron energy is above

7

any excitation or the ionization threshold (the latter is at roughly 9.8 eV for both molecules

in this study, but since our model is approximate we can expect that this will be shifted

upward by a few eV), the electron molecule compound will have many more channels to

decay into, with the result that the higher energy resonances will be modiﬁed by these new

interactions.

All the target quantities are calculated at the Hartree-Fock level using a 6-31G** basis

set, and the target equilibrium geometries have been optimized at the same level of theory.

The remaining details of the calculations are very similar to those reported in Ref. 9,

including the convergence criteria. The dimension of the matrices is roughly 200000 by

200000, and our convergence studies show that increasing the number of sectors by 30%

lowers the position of the resonances by about 0.1 eV in THF. These calculations are very

cumbersome, and for the level of accuracy we are aiming for here this convergence criterion

seems adequate. For details on the treatment of the integrals and of the nuclear Coulomb

singularities we refer the reader to our previous publications, speciﬁcally Sec. IIE of Ref. 18

and Sec. IID of Ref. 9.

III. RESULTS: THF

In Fig. 3 our results are compared to the low-resolution experimental data of Zecca et

al.13 and the theoretical results of Bouchiha et al.,15 obtained like ours without performing

a Born closure to consider the eﬀect of the dipole ﬁeld on the higher partial waves. We also

plot the data in the form of a time-delay,9 to make the resonance position and width more

evident. The total time-delay is the sum of the eigenvalues of the hermitian matrix

Q = iS

dS†
dE

,

8

(6)

where S is the scattering matrix. In Fig. 3 we also plot the resonant channels, particular

eigenvalues of the time-delay matrix that are larger than the others and show a Lorentzian

behavior that sets them apart from the rest. We rescaled the total time-delay by dividing

it by a factor, to show more easily everything in the same graph.

The order of magnitude of our cross section is not diﬀerent from the results of Ref. 15

calculated without Born closure. Since our calculations do not include excited states of the

target, we will not be able to detect core-excited resonances (present instead in the calcu-

lations of Ref. 15). Also comparing with total cross sections we will be missing rotational

and vibrational excitations and the electronically inelastic channels, therefore elastic cross

sections should be lower than experimental total cross sections, this does not happen in our

case, and it is partly due to the approximate nature of our model. With respect to exper-

iment, the comparison is diﬃcult due to the eﬀect of higher partial waves (with l > 10).

The Born correction has been calculated in Ref. 15, and the cross section becomes higher

than experiment, we would expect a similar eﬀect for our data. Due to the low resolution,

the experimental results below 5 eV are (in the words of the authors) to be considered only

indicative. The resonant structure that appears around 9.3 eV in our results looks simi-

lar to the analogous experimental feature, also taking into account that our model usually

predicts resonances about 1.5-2 eV higher than their experimental position, as veriﬁed for

the DNA bases9 and also for molecules like carbon dioxide, benzene and SF6,32 because of

the approximations adopted. This is due mostly to the adoption of a local exchange model,

since for example, in a system like CO2

33,34 this approximation causes a resonance shift

of around 2 eV or so for model static-exchange, compared to all-electron static-exchange

calculations, that is not possible to compensate with the polarization-correlation potential,

which indeed shifts the resonance by a similar amount for this molecule (1.5 eV compared to

9

2 eV) with respect to correct polarization. Also the model polarization is approximate, but

the model exchange constitutes the largest error in our calculations. Indeed, if we perform

a purely static-exchange calculation (see Fig. 3) the position of the resonance (maximum

of the time-delay) is at 11.9eV, 2.6 eV higher than the result including polarization, and

it is composed of three overlapping resonances. For what we said above about the shifts

generated by the model potential with respect to exact exchange, this resonance should be

around 10 eV in an all-electron calculation, therefore probably visible in the calculations of

Ref. 15 that go up to 10 eV in energy. When polarization-correlation is added this value

should fall below 10eV, and thus be clearly visible in the data of Ref. 15.

From the fact that our resonances are shifted too high in energy one might have thought

that the widths would turn out to be larger than the experimental ones. We have veriﬁed

in the past for many systems9,32 that our calculated widths are comparable to their correct

values.

No resonance was found in this energy range in the other published theoretical study.15

Through a Lorentzian ﬁt, we predict a width of about 2.5 eV for this resonance. At the

static-exchange level, the resonance has a larger width, of about 3.1 eV. A higher energy

resonance is found at 16.2 eV and it is even broader (about 3.0 eV). The partial wave

contributions are mainly l = 4 (with a contribution of 70%) for the lower energy resonance

and for the higher energy resonance l = 5 (50%) and l = 3 (30%, as can be seen in Tab.

I). The partial wave decomposition will depend somewhat on what center in chosen as the

expansion. We always perform the decomposition around the center of mass of the molecule,

which seems a reasonable choice.

To understand better the reason for the diﬀerence between our results and the ones in

Ref. 15 and to make sure that our results are consistent with other known results, we have

10

ﬁrst of all performed a time-delay analysis20,35 of our scattering data, shown on the bottom

of Fig. 3. This has allowed us to establish the presence of three superimposed resonances,

two of which peak at 9 eV (with one sensibly more intense than the other) while the third

peaks around 10eV, and its intensity falls between the other two. Due to the large width of

these resonances, the weakest of the channels in Fig. 3 has a time-delay eigenvalue which is

not much larger than the nonresonant eigenvalues.

An existing calculation for cyclopropane36 (C3H6) shows that this cycloalkane has a cross

section with a similar resonant structure at 6 eV. It is superimposed on a broader resonance

at higher energy and other nonresonant contributions that give a very wide plateau, although

in this case the ﬁrst feature is not a composite resonance. The symmetry of the cyclopropane

resonance in Ref. 36 is even with respect to the plane of the three carbon atoms, and the

same occurs in THF, in the sense that although this compound is not planar, our resonance

structures do not change sign above and below the ring bonds. It is plausible then that due to

its larger frame and density of virtual orbitals, THF is able to support more quasi-degenerate

resonant states at a similar energy.

Since there are no other existing experimental data on THF, we have performed calcu-

lations for cyclopentane (C5H10), which is very similar to THF except that here the oxygen

atom is substituted with a -CH2- group. For this molecule, experimental data37 shows a

broad shape resonance at 8eV. The similarity of the two molecules suggests that many fea-

tures of the cross section will be analogous. The results are compared to THF in Fig. 4.

The cross section closely resembles that of THF, with a triple resonance superimposed on a

broad higher energy resonance centered around 16 eV, which produces a wide plateau. The

electron scattering cross sections for alkanes and cycloalkanes of diﬀerent sizes have very

similar behaviors,37,38 namely the same resonant structures and a magnitude dependent on

11

the number of carbon atoms. Our evidence thus suggests that THF, being very similar to

a cycloalkane, shares these common features, as suggested also in Ref. 13. Also the cross

section for cyclopentane is, in our calculations, larger than in THF, a trend that seems to

be conﬁrmed by the experimental data.13,38 The cyclopentane cross section peak is roughly

50 ˚A2 which is very close to the experimental value37 for the total cross section. Recent and

as yet unpublished theoretical calculations,39 performed on a THF molecule distorted to

achieve a planar geometry for the furanose ring, show results similar to ours, with a double

shape resonance in a similar energy range.

As in Ref. 9 we attempt to correlate the spatial shape of the resonant wavefunction with

the Hartree-Fock virtual orbitals obtained with a small (6-31G**) basis set. In this case the

analysis is complicated by the fact that the molecules are not planar, so a projection on a two-

dimensional surface would not pass through all the nuclei and, since the resonance is wide,

diﬀerent contributions mix and overlap. However, we have established that the resonant

wavefunction at its peak resembles closely a virtual orbital with energy of 7 eV (orbital

23). At higher energy (around 10.5 eV, when the second resonant contribution becomes

dominant), the resonance spatial structure appears similar to an orbital of 11 eV of energy

(orbital 31). We show this in Fig. 5. Since there is a great degree of resonance overlap,

the relationship of the resonant wavefunctions to the virtual orbitals we show becomes even

clearer when observing the other virtual orbitals, which are actually very diﬀerent from our

wavefunctions.

Recently, DEA cross sections have been measured11 for all the DNA subunits. These

cross sections display two prominent resonances at 6 and 8 eV, of width around 1 eV each

for THF, which could correlate with the calculated shape resonance, although clearly much

complicated vibrational dynamics happens between electron capture and dissociation that

12

we do not take into account here, and in the results of Ref. 15 there are electronically

inelastic resonances in this energy region which could lead to similar outcomes in DEA.

Several electron-energy-loss (EEL) studies of THF40,41 and cyclopentane42 have been

performed, and some attempts have been made at assigning the resonances, also in relation to

the position of the excited states from absorption spectroscopy. In Ref. 41 a gas-phase EEL

peak for THF at 6.6 eV is assigned as a core-excited resonance with a parent ion of Rydberg

character, centered on the oxygen atom, whereas a similar experimental peak in cyclopentane

in Ref. 42 is assigned as a shape resonance, on the basis of a molecular orbital argument,

with the electron wavefunction distributed around the whole ring. Our calculations seem

to agree with this second assignment, for two reasons: ﬁrst, the resonance is very similar

in character in THF and cyclopentane (see Fig. 4), and therefore it seems implausible

that it derives from excitations on the oxygen; second, the resonant wavefunctions in Fig.

5 are found to be delocalized over the entire ring as had been speculated in Ref. 42 for

cyclopentane. At higher energies core-excited contributions are most likely predominant, as

was suggested in Ref. 40.

It is diﬃcult to attempt a prediction of what the evolution of the resonances found

in elastic scattering could be, when the nuclear dynamics is included. At present this

is computationally prohibitive, but a ﬁrst analysis can be attempted by inspecting our

calculated results. From the spatial structures of the resonant wavefunctions it seems likely

that the resonances could initiate a break-up of the ring, because of the presence of many

nodal surfaces cutting through the ring bonds. For example, the experimental DEA cross

sections for deoxyribose in Ref. 10 exhibit a peak at around 6 eV for production of the

anion C3H5O−

3 , which could be generated by a resonant structure that shows a node cutting

through the ring from C3 to C1, similar to the top left plot in Fig. 5, given that deoxyribose

13

has side groups attached to C4 and C3 that could lead to production of the aforementioned

anion.

IV. RESULTS: H3PO4

In the case of phosphoric acid there are no available theoretical or experimental data to

compare with, and consequently our analysis of the results will be somewhat more limited.

The cross sections show two prominent resonances, one at 9.1 eV and the other at 15.8 eV,

with respective widths 2.0 eV and 1.5 eV. The main partial wave contributions are l = 4

and l = 3 at 40% and 30% respectively for both resonances, as stated in Tab. I. At low

energies there is a sharp rise in cross section due to the dipole moment. Cross section and

total time delay are illustrated in Fig. 6. It is diﬃcult to say why the second resonance is

narrower than the ﬁrst, since this is somewhat counterintuitive. We will limit ourselves to

pointing out that in a complicated polyatomic molecule, shape resonance widths depend not

only on the total energy, but also the size of the probability density near the escape regions

in the multidimensional potential. It is possible, therefore, that a higher-energy resonance

could be narrower than one at lower energy. Resonances broader at lower energy than the

higher energy ones can be seen, for example, in C60 fullerene.26,43

In Ref. 11 the DEA cross section has been measured for trimethylphosphate (PO4(CH3)3),

and it displays a very wide and prominent resonant structure at 7.5 eV, to which our 9.1

eV resonance could correlate. No branching ratio has been measured for this compound.

The structure of phosphoric acid presents three identical -OH groups and therefore the

resonances will show structures with a similar probability for the scattering electron to end

up in each of these groups, making for complicated spatial proﬁles, which in the end are

not very illuminating. For these reasons we will not attempt here an analysis of the spatial

14

structure of the resonances.

As in THF, the shape resonances are quite broad, so the anions will be relatively short

lived, and probably they will autoionize back (possibly with vibrational excitation) before

having the possibility to lead to a breakup or energy transfer to another DNA subunit.

However, the presence of water, a structural component in biological DNA, can act to

stabilize the anions, and probably will signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the lifetimes of these resonances

in the cell nucleus, since the backbone is in closer contact with the water and the surrounding

environment, compared to the bases that lie inside the double helix and are presumably

somewhat less aﬀected by the presence of the solvent.

V. CONCLUSIONS

We have calculated electron scattering cross sections from molecules that closely resemble

the DNA sugar-phosphate backbone components, namely tetrahydrofuran and phosphoric

acid, as a ﬁrst step to model the DNA radiation damage caused by low energy electrons.

Since our model is approximate, resonance shifts of around 2 eV higher than experiment are

usually observed. In THF we ﬁnd a very broad resonance, which agrees (within the limits of

our model) with recent experimental data, but not with one recent theoretical calculation.

Also for phosphoric acid we ﬁnd shape resonances. In both cases the resonances are quite

broad and high in energy and are not expected to play a major role, compared to those of

the nitrogenous bases, in electron capture leading to damage in DNA. For THF we have

also attempted to correlate the resonant structures with recent DEA experiments and to

electron scattering experiments from other related molecules.

that show the similarities between these compounds. The hydrogen atoms that ﬁll the carbon

valences are not shown. The ring conformation we have used in the calculations is not planar but

puckered, as indicated in Fig. 1 for THF, therefore the C2 carbon is below the plane and C3 above,

here they are indicated both above for ease of drawing.

FIG. 3: Partial elastic electron scattering cross sections from THF (solid line), the dot-dashed

line represents the static-exchange results. Calculations involve partial waves up to l=10 and

the dipole physics outside the R-matrix box is included exactly for those partial waves. Top:

cross section comparison with theoretical (dotted)15 and experimental (dashed)13 results, the open

squares are the actual experimental data points. Bottom: time-delay plot to highlight the presence

of resonances. The full curve is the total time delay, while the numbered curves correspond to the

few highest eigenvalues that exhibit resonant behavior. The total time delay was rescaled to show

all curves on the same graph more easily.

FIG. 4: Unconverged ﬁxed nuclei elastic cross sections for electron scattering by THF and cy-

clopentane. The two molecular structures are similar (THF has an oxygen atom instead of a -CH2-

group) and so are their electron scattering cross sections. Cyclopentane has essentially zero dipole

moment, therefore the low energy part of its cross section does not rise the way it does in THF.

FIG. 5: (Color online) Left: Time delay eigenfunctions for THF on resonance at 9eV (top, where

the widely-spaced dotted curve (labeled ”2”) in Fig. 3 is dominant) and 10.5eV (bottom, where

instead the dashed curve (labeled ”1”) in Fig. 3 dominates). A slice of the three dimensional

eigenfunctions is shown, on the plane that contains OC1C4, while C3 is above the plane and C2

below. The red contours identify positive areas and the blue negative areas of the real part of the

wavefunction. Right: virtual orbitals for energies around 7 (top) and 11 eV (bottom) from HF at

the 6-31G** level. The full lines identify positive areas and the broken lines negative areas. The

correspondence between the two top plots and the two bottom plots is very pronounced, allowing

to identify the two main contributions to the resonance. Although the molecule is not planar this

projection is much easier to read than the three dimensional structures.

again involve partial waves up to l=10 and the dipole physics outside the R-matrix box is included

exactly for those partial waves. Two broad resonances are present, at 8.9 and 15.7 eV, the cross

section is smaller than in the DNA bases and comparable to THF.

The role of vibrational excitation of a single mode in the scattering of methane is studied by
wave packet simulations of oriented CH4 and CD4 molecules from a ﬂat surface. All nine internal
vibrations are included. In the translational energy range from 32 up to 128 kJ/mol we ﬁnd that
initial vibrational excitations enhance the transfer of translational energy towards vibrational energy
and increase the accessibility of the entrance channel for dissociation. Our simulations predict that
initial vibrational excitations of the asymmetrical stretch (ν3) and especially the symmetrical stretch
(ν1) modes will give the highest enhancement of the dissociation probability of methane.

The dissociative adsorption of methane on transition metals is an important reaction in catalysis; it is the rate
limiting step in steam reforming to produce syngas, and it is prototypical for catalytic C–H activation. Although
the reaction mechanism has been studied intensively, it is not been fully understood yet. A number of molecular
beam experiments in which the dissociation energy was measured as a function of translational energy have observed
that vibrationally hot CH4 dissociates more readily than cold CH4, with the energy in the internal vibrations being
about as eﬀective as the translational energy in inducing dissociation.1–7 Two independent bulb gas experiment with
laser excitation of the ν3 asymmetrical stretch and 2ν4 umbrella modes on the Rh(111) surface,8 and laser excitation
of the ν3 and 2ν3 modes on thin ﬁlms of rhodium9 did not reveal any noticeable enhancement in the reactivity of
CH4. A recent molecular beam experiment with laser excitation of the ν3 mode did succeed in measuring a strong
enhancement of the dissociation on a Ni(100) surface. However, this enhancement was still much too low to account for
the vibrational activation observed in previous studies and indicated that other vibrationally excited modes contribute
signiﬁcantly to the reactivity of thermal samples.10

Wave packet simulations of the methane dissociation reaction on transition metals have treated the methane
molecule always as a diatomic up to now.11–16 Apart from one C–H bond (a pseudo ν3 stretch mode) and the
molecule surface distance, either (multiple) rotations or some lattice motion were included. None of them have looked
at the role of the other internal vibrations, so there is no model that describes which vibrationally excited mode might
be responsible for the experimental observed vibrational activation. In previous papers we have reported on wave
packet simulations to determine which and to what extent internal vibrations are important for the dissociation of CH4
in the vibrational ground state,17 and the isotope eﬀect of CD4.18 We were not able yet to simulate the dissociation
including all internal vibrations. Instead we simulated the scattering of methane, for which all internal vibrations can
be included, and used the results to deduce consequences for the dissociation. These simulations indicate that for
methane to dissociate the interaction of the molecule with the surface should lead to an elongated equilibrium C–H
bond length close to the surface. In this letter we report on new wave packet simulations of the role of vibrational
excitations for the scattering of CH4 and CD4 molecules with all nine internal vibrations. The dynamical features of
these simulations give new insight into the initial steps of the dissociation process. The conventional explanation is
that vibrations help dissociation by adding energy needed to overcome the dissociation barrier. We ﬁnd that two other
new explanations play also a role. One of them is the enhanced transfer of translational energy into the dissociation
channel by initial vibrational excitations. The other more important explanation is the increased accessibility of the
entrance channel for dissociation.

We have used the multi-conﬁgurational time-dependent Hartree (MCTDH) method for our wave packet
simulation.19,20 This method can deal with a large number of degrees of freedom and with large grids. (See Ref. 21
for a recent review.) Initial translational energy has been chosen in the range of 32 to 128 kJ/mol. The initial state
has been written as a product state of ten functions; one for the normally incident translational coordinate, and one
for each internal vibration. All vibrations were taken to be in the ground state except one which was put in the ﬁrst
excited state. The orientation of the CH4/CD4 was ﬁxed, and the vibrationally excited state had a1 symmetry in
the symmetry group of the molecule plus surface (C3v when one or three H/D atoms point towards the surface, and
C2v when two point towards the surface.) The potential-energy surface is characterised by an elongation of the C–H
bonds when the molecule approaches the surfaces, no surface corrugation, and a molecule-surface part appropriate
for Ni(111). It has been shown to give reasonable results, and is described in Refs. 17 and 18. These articles give also
the computational details about the conﬁgurational basis and number of grid points, and contain illustrations of the
orientations and the important vibrational modes.

We can obtain a good idea about the overall activation of a mode by looking at the kinetic energy expectation

1

values hΨ(t)|Tj|Ψ(t)i for each mode j. During the scattering process the change in the translational kinetic energy is
the largest. It is plotted in Fig. 1 as a function of time for CH4 in the orientation with three bond pointing towards
the surface with an initial kinetic energy of 96 kJ/mol and diﬀerent initial vibrational states. When the molecule
approaches the surface the kinetic energy falls down to a minimum value. This minimum value varies only slightly
with the initial vibrational states of the molecule. The total loss of translational kinetic energy varies substantially,
however. The initial translational kinetic energy is not conserved. This means that the vibrational excitation enhances
inelastic scattering. Especially an excitation of the ν1 symmetrical stretch and to a lesser extend the ν3 asymmetrical
stretch mode result in an increased transfer of kinetic energy towards the intramolecular vibrational energy. The
inelastic scatter component (the initial minus the ﬁnal translational energy) for both isotopes in the orientation
with three bonds pointing towards the surface, shows the following trend for the initial vibrational excitations of
the modes; ν1 > ν3 > ν4 > ground state. CH4 scatters more inelastic than CD4 over the whole calculated range
of translational kinetic energies, if the molecule has an initial excitation of the ν3 stretch mode. CH4 scatters also
more inelastically than CD4 in the ν1 symmetrical stretch mode at higher energies , but at lower energies it scatters
slightly less inelastically. For the molecules with the non-excited state or an excitation in the ν4 umbrella mode CD4
has a higher inelastic scattering component than CH4. At an initial translational kinetic energy of 128 kJ/mol the
excitation of the ν4 umbrella mode results in a strong enhancement of the inelastic scattering component. For CD4
the inelastic scattering component for the initial excited ν4 umbrella mode can become even larger than for the initial
excited ν3 stretch mode. For the orientation with two bonds pointing towards the surface we observe the same trends
for the relation between the inelastic scatter components and the excited initial vibrational modes, but the inelastic
scatter component are less than half of the values for the orientation with three bonds pointing towards the surface.
Also the excitation of the ν3 asymmetrical stretch modes results now in a higher inelastic scattering component for
CD4 than for CH4. Excitation of the ν2 bending mode gives a little higher inelastic scatter component than the
vibrational ground state. For the orientation with one bond pointing towards the surface we observe an even lower
inelastic scattering component. At an initial kinetic energy of 128 kJ/mol we ﬁnd that both the ν1 and ν3 stretch
modes have on inelastic component of around 6.5 kJ/mol for CD4 and 4.0 kJ/mol for CH4. At an initial translational
energy of 32 kJ/mol we observe for both isotopes in all orientations a very small increase of translational kinetic
energy for the vibrational excited molecule, which means that there is a net transfer from intramolecular vibrational
energy through the surface repulsion into the translational coordinate.

There seem to be two groups of vibrations with diﬀerent qualitative behavior with respect to (de)excitation when
the molecule hits the surface. The ﬁrst group, let’s call it the “stretch” group, consist of the ν3 asymmetric stretch
in any orientation and the ν1 symmetric stretch in the orientation with three hydrogen/deuterium atoms pointing
to the surface. The second, let’s call it the “bending” group, consists of all bending vibrations and the ν1 in other
orientations. When the molecule is initially in the vibrational ground state the kinetic energy in the vibrations
increases, reaches a maximum at the turn-around point, and then drops back almost to the initial level except for a
small contribution due to the inelastic scattering component. The vibrations within a group have very similar amounts
of kinetic energy, but the “stretch” group has clearly a larger inelastic component than the “bending” group, and also
the kinetic energy at the turn-around point is larger. When the molecule has initially an excitation of a vibration
of the “stretch” group then the kinetic energy of that vibration increases, reaches a maximum at the turn-around
point, and drops to a level lower than it was initially. For an excitation of a vibration of the “bending” group there
is no maximum, but its kinetic energy simply drops to a lower level. We see that in all cases there is not only a
transfer of energy from the translation to vibrations, but also an energy ﬂow from the initially excited vibration to
other vibrations. However, the total energy of the vibrational kinetic energy and the intramolecular potential energy
increases, because it has to absorb the inelastic scattering component.

Figure 2 shows the (repulsive) interaction with the surface during the scattering process of CH4 at an initial kinetic
energy of 96 kJ/mol and diﬀerent initial vibrational excitations for the orientation with three hydrogens pointing
towards the surface. Since this is a repulsive term with a exponential fall-oﬀ changes in the repulsion indicate the
motion of the part of the wave packet closest to the surface. At the beginning of the simulation the curves are almost
linear in a logarithmic plot, because the repulsion hardly changes the velocity of the molecule. After some time the
molecule enters into a region with a higher surface repulsion and the slopes of the curves drop. This results in a
maximum at the turn-around point, where most of the initial translational kinetic energy is transfered into potential
energy of the surface repulsion. For a classical simulation it would have meant no translational kinetic energy, but
it corresponds with the minimum kinetic energy for our wave packet simulations. Past the maximum, a part of the
wave packet will accelerate away from the surface, and the slope becomes negative. The expectation value of the
translational kinetic energy (see Fig.1) increases at the same time. The slope of the curves in Fig. 2 becomes less
negative towards the end of the simulation, although the expectation value of the translational kinetic energy in this
time region is almost constant. The reason for this is that a part of the wave packet with less translational kinetic
energy is still in a region close to the surface. We see also that the height of the plateaus for the diﬀerent initial
vibrational excitations is again in the order; ν1 > ν3 > ν4 > ground state. This again indicates that a larger part of

2

the wave packet is inelastically scattered when ν1 is excited than when ν3 is excited, etc.

At lower initial translational kinetic energies the plateaus have a lower position and the main gap exist between the
plateaus of the ν1 and ν3 stretch modes and the lower positioned plateaus of the ν4 umbrella and the ground state.
At an initial translational kinetic energies of 128 kJ/mol the positions of the plateaus are higher and the diﬀerences
between the initial vibrational excitations are also smaller. The plateau of the ν3 stretch mode is even around the
same position as the ν4 umbrella mode for CD4 in the orientation with three bonds pointing towards the surface at
this initial energy. The orientation with two bonds pointing towards the surface shows the same trends. The plateaus
of the initial excited ν2 bending mode are located slightly above the ground state for both isotopes. For the orientation
with one bond pointing towards the surface the relative positions of the plateaus of the diﬀerent initial excitations
are the same as at low energies in the orientation with three bonds pointing towards the surface.

Even though we did not try to describe the dissociation itself, the scattering simulation do yield indications for
the role of vibrational excitations on the dissociation of methane, and compare these with experimental observations.
The dissociation of methane occurs over a late barrier, because it is enhanced by vibrational energy.22 Conventionally,
the role of vibrational excitation on the enhancement of dissociation probability was discussed as an eﬀect of the
availability of the extra (vibrational kinetic) energy for overcoming the dissociation barrier. Our simulations show
that such a process might play a role, but they show also that two other processes occur through vibrational excitation.
Firstly, an initial vibrational excitation increases translational kinetic energy transfer towards the intramolecular
vibrational energy. The simulations show that this inelastic scatter component can be seen in an large enhancement of
the vibrational kinetic energy in the stretch modes at the turn-around point. This increase is larger for higher initial
translational kinetic energy and is most eﬀective in the orientation with three bonds pointing towards the surface. If
the dissociation of methane occurs primarily in this orientation, then we would expect, based on the total available
vibrational energy after hitting the surface, that excitation of the ν1 symmetrical stretch mode is the most eﬀective
for enhancing the dissociation probability. The ν3 asymmetrical stretch mode appears to be less so. An explanation of
the enhanced inelastic scatter compound by vibrational excitation is that through excitation the bonds are weakened,
which will ease excitation in the initial non-excited modes. Other excitations than the ν2, ν3, or ν4 with a1 symmetry
for a particular orientation can possibly result in higher energy transfers, but we think that the diﬀerence with ν1
(which has always a1 symmetry) would be still large.

Secondly, the accessibility of the dissociation channel enhances also the dissociation probability. We have concluded
previously that our potential mimics reasonably the entrance channel for dissociation.17 In this letter we ﬁnd that a
part of the wave packet has a longer residence time at the surface. It is this part of the wave packet that accesses the
dissociation channel, and it is also this part that is able to come near to the transition state for dissociation. From
Figs. 1 and 2 we conclude that the ν1 stretch mode will enhance the dissociation probability the most. The enhanced
accessibility by vibrational excitation is explained by the spread of the wave packet along a C–H bond, which gives a
higher probability for the system to be atop the dissociation barrier.

The molecular beam experiment with excitations of the ν3 asymmetrical stretch mode of CH4 of Ref. 10 shows that
a single excitation of the ν3 asymmetrical stretch mode enhances dissociation, but the measured reactivity of the ν3
stretch mode is too low to account for the total vibrational activation observed in the molecular beam study of Ref. 5.
It means that excitation of another mode than the ν3 stretch will be more eﬀective for dissociation. Our simulations
show that indeed excitation of ν3 stretch will enhance dissociation, but predict that excitation of the ν1 symmetrical
stretch mode will be more eﬀective if the dissociation occurs primary in the orientation with multiple bonds pointing
towards the surface. The contribution of the ν1 symmetrical stretch mode cannot be measured directly, because it
has no infra-red activity. However, the contribution of the ν1 mode can be estimated using a molecular beam study
as follows. The contribution of the ν3 stretch has already been determined.10 Similarly the contribution of the ν4
umbrella mode can be determined. The contribution of the ν2 bending can be estimated from our simulations to be
somewhat lower than the ν4 umbrella contribution. The total contribution of all vibrations is known from Ref. 5, and a
simple subtraction will give us then the contribution of the ν1 stretch. At high translational energies the accessibility
of the dissociation channel for molecules with an excited ν4 umbrella mode is near to that of the molecules with
excited stretch modes, and for CD4 the inelastic scattering is also enhanced. So the excitation of the ν4 umbrella
mode can still contribute signiﬁcantly to the vibrational activation, because it has also higher Boltzmann population
in the molecular beam than the stretch modes.

This research has been ﬁnancially supported by the Council for Chemical Sciences of the Netherlands Organization

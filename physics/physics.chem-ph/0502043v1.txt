Abstract

We prove the bijectivity of the constraints of normalization and of the Fermi-Coulomb hole charge

sum rule at each electron position for approximate wave functions. This bijectivity is surprising

in light of the fact that normalization depends upon the probability of ﬁnding an electron at some

position, whereas the Fermi-Coulomb hole sum rule depends on the probability of two electrons

staying apart because of correlations due to the Pauli exclusion principle and Coulomb repulsion.

We further demonstrate the bijectivity of these sum rules by example.

Sum rules play an important role in physics, and there are many ways in which they

are employed. Within the realm of electronic structure theory, for example, accurate

properties of a system may be determined by the use of an approximate potential whose

parameters are adjusted so as to ensure the satisfaction of a sum rule. Metal surface

properties such as the surface energy and work function are obtained by application of

the Theophilou-Budd-Vannimenus sum rule [1] which relates the value of the electrostatic

potential at the surface to the known bulk properties of the metal. The parameters in a

model eﬀective potential at a metal surface are then adjusted [2] so as to satisfy this sum

rule. Another manner in which sum rules have proved to be signiﬁcant is in the context

of Kohn-Sham density functional theory (KS-DFT) [3], a local eﬀective potential theory

of electronic structure that is extensively employed in atomic, molecular, and condensed

matter physics. In KS-DFT, all the many-body eﬀects are incorporated in the ‘exchange-

correlation’ energy functional of the ground state density. Since this functional is unknown,

it must be approximated. A successful approach [4] to the construction of approximate

‘exchange-correlation’ energy functionals, and of their derivatives which represent the local

eﬀective potential in the theory, is the requirement of satisfaction of various scaling laws [5]

together with those of sum rules on the Fermi and Coulomb hole charge distributions [6].

In the recently developed Quantal density functional theory (Q-DFT) [6], the local eﬀective

potential is described instead in terms of the system wave function. Thus, one method for

the construction of the local eﬀective potential in Q-DFT is to employ an approximate wave

function that is a functional of some functions [7]. These latter functions are determined

such that the wave function functional satisﬁes various constraints such as normalization,

the Fermi-Coulomb or Coulomb hole sum rules, or reproduces a physical observable of

interest such as the density, diamagnetic susceptibility, nuclear magnetic constant, etc.[7].

The satisfaction of a particular sum rule by an approximate potential, or an ‘exchange-

correlation’ energy functional, or a wave function functional, however, does not necessarily

imply the satisfaction of other sum rules.

In this paper we describe a counter intuitive

bijective relationship between the sum rules of normalization and that of the Fermi-Coulomb

or Coulomb hole charge. The satisfaction of either one of the sum rules by an approximate

wave function ensures the satisfaction of the other. This bijectivity is counter intuitive

because the constraints of normalization and of the Fermi-Coulomb hole depend on

2

distinctly diﬀerent quantum-mechanical probabilities. The bijectivity is also of importance

from a practical numerical perspective. The proof and demonstration of the bijectivity of

these sum rules constitutes the paper.

To understand why this bijectivity is so counter to intuition, let us consider the physics

underlying the two properties of an electronic system that these sum rules depend upon.

For a system of N electrons, the constraint of normalization on an approximate wave

function Ψ(X) requires that

Ψ(X)∗Ψ(X)dX = 1,

Z

where X = x1, ..., xN ; dX = dx1, ..., dxN ; x = r, s with r and s being the spatial and spin

coordinates of an electron. (Atomic units e = ¯h = m = 1 are assumed.) Equivalently, this

sum rule may be written in terms of the electronic density ρ(r). The density ρ(r) is N times

the probability of an electron being at r :

ρ(r) = N

Ψ∗(rσ, XN −1)Ψ(rσ, XN −1)dXN −1,

Z

Xi

where dXN −1 = dx2, ..., dxN . The normalization sum rule then becomes

ρ(r)dr = N.

Z

The density ρ(r) is a static or local charge distribution. By this is meant that its

structure remains unchanged as a function of electron position r. Integration of this charge

distribution—the normalization sum rule—then gives the number N of electrons. Thus,

normalization is a statement as to the number of electrons in the system.

The deﬁnition of the Fermi-Coulomb hole charge distribution ρxc(rr′) derives from that
of the pair-correlation density g(rr′). The pair-correlation density is the density at r′ for an

electron at r. The density at r′ diﬀers from that at r because of electron correlations due to

the Pauli exclusion principle and Coulomb repulsion. Thus, the pair density is deﬁned as

Its total charge, for each electron position r, is therefore

g(rr′)dr′ = N

Z

−

The pair-correlation density g(rr′) is a dynamic or nonlocal charge distribution in that

its structure changes as a function of electron position for nonuniform electron density

systems. If there were no electron correlations, the density at r′ would be ρ(r′). Hence, the

pair-correlation density is the density at r′ plus the reduction in density at r′ due to the

electron correlations. The reduction in density about an electron which occurs as a result

of the Pauli exclusion principle and Coulomb repulsion is the Fermi-Coulomb hole charge

ρxc(rr′). Thus, the Fermi-Coulomb hole is deﬁned as

ρxc(rr′) = g(rr′)

ρ(r′).

−

The Fermi-Coulomb hole ρxc(rr′) about an electron is also a dynamic or nonlocal charge

distribution. For nonuniform electron gas systems, its structure is diﬀerent for each electron

position. Since each electron digs a hole in the inhomogeneous sea of electrons equal in charge

to that of a proton, it follows that the total charge of the Fermi-Coulomb hole surrounding

an electron, for each electron position r, is

This is the Fermi-Coulomb hole sum rule.

ρxc(rr′)dr′ =

−

The deﬁnition of the Coulomb hole ρc(rr′), which is the reduction in density at r′ for an
electron at r′ because of Coulomb repulsion, in turn derives from that of the Fermi-Coulomb

ρxc(rr′) and Fermi ρx(rr′) holes. The Fermi hole is the reduction in density at r′ for an

electron at r that occurs due to the Pauli exclusion principle. The Fermi hole is deﬁned via

in Eq. (5), and the Slater determinant is normalized, the total charge of the Fermi hole, for

each electron position r, is also that of a proton:

The Coulomb hole is then deﬁned as the diﬀerence between the Fermi-Coulomb and Fermi

holes:

This is the Coulomb hole sum rule.

Both the normalization and the Fermi-Coulomb or Coulomb hole constraints are charge

conservation sum rules. However, their physical origin, and therefore the charge conserved

in each case,

is diﬀerent. That these distinctly diﬀerent charge conservation rules are

intrinsically linked bijectively constitutes the theorem we prove.

Theorem: The normalization and Fermi-Coulomb or Coulomb hole sum rules are bijec-

tive. Satisfaction of the normalization sum rule by an approximate wave function implies the

automatic satisfaction of the Fermi-Coulomb or Coulomb hole sum rules for each electron

position. Conversely, the satisfaction of the Fermi-Coulomb or Coulomb hole sum rules for

each electron position by an approximate wave function implies the normalization of that

wave function:

Proof : (a)The proof of the arrow to the right in Eq. (13) is as follows. Let us assume

an approximate wave function that is normalized. Then, integration of Eq.(6) over r′ using

the normalization constraint of Eq.(3) leads directly to the Fermi-Coulomb hole sum rule

5

of Eq.(7).

(b) For the arrow to the left, consider an approximate wave function that satisﬁes the

Fermi-Coulomb hole sum rule Eq.(7) for each electron position r. The sum rule Eq.(5) on

the pair-correlation density g(rr′) follows from its deﬁnition Eq.(4) which is independent

of whether or not the wave function is normalized. Thus, since both the sum rules on the

Fermi-Coulomb hole and the pair-correlation density are satisﬁed, then on integration of

Eq.(6) over r′, normalization of the wave function is ensured.

(c) Consider an approximate wave function from which one constructs a Fermi-Coulomb hole

for each electron position r. For a normalizd Slater determinant Φ
{

ϕi}

, next deﬁne a Fermi

hole ρx(rr′) which then satisﬁes the Fermi hole sum rule of Eq.(10). If the satisfaction of the

Coulomb hole sum rule is now ensured, then this guarantees the satisfaction of the Fermi-

Coulomb hole sum rule, which as shown in (b), ensures that the wave function is normalized.

Recall that normalization depends upon the probability of ﬁnding an electron at

some position. On the other hand, the Fermi-Coulomb and Coulomb hole sum rules

depend on the reduction in probability of two electrons approaching each other. The

fact that satisfaction of the integral condition of either one of these probabilities means

the satisfaction on the integral condition of the other is not obvious, and therefore surprising.

We next demonstrate the bijectivity of Eq. (13) by application to the ground state of the

Helium atom. The nonrelativistic Hamiltonian of the atom is

where r1, r2 are the coordinates of the two electrons, r12 is the distance between them,

be easily demonstrated by assuming an approximate wave function ψ with parameters

since the Fermi-Coulomb hole sum rule must be satisﬁed at each electron position. It is,

however, possible to demonstrate the bijectivity by assuming the wave function to be a

functional of a set of functions χ: ψ = ψ[χ] instead of simply a function. The functions

χ are determined so as to satisfy the normalization or Fermi-Coulomb hole sum rules as

described in Ref.7.

[7]

For the left to right equivalence, we choose the wave function functional to be of the form

ψ[χ] = Φ(α, s)[1

f (χ; s, u)],

−

(15)

withΦ[α, s] = (α3/π)e−αs, f (s, u) = e−qu(1 + qu)[1

χ(q; s, u)(1 + u/2)], where α and

−

q are variational parameters, s = r1 + r2, u = r12. The function χ = χ2 of [7], with

the energy minimized values of the parameters being α = 1.6629, q = 0.17049. This

wave function is normalized to unity, the function χ being determined as a solution to

a quadratic equation. We further assume, as in local eﬀective potential energy theory,

that the Fermi hole ρx(rr′) =

ρ(r′)/2. The corresponding Coulomb holes ρc(rr′) are

plotted in Figs. 1 and 2 for electron positions at r = 0, 0.566, 0.8, 1.0 (a.u.) together with

the exact Coulomb hole [8]. (The electron is on the z axis corresponding to θ = 0. The

cross section through the Coulomb hole plotted corresponds to θ′ = 0 with respect to the

electron-nucleus direction. The graph for r′ < 0 corresponds to the structure for θ′ = π and

r′ > 0.) The two Coulomb holes, though similar are inequivalent. Integration of both the ex-

act and approximate Coulomb holes for each electron position leads to a total charge of zero.

For the right to left equivalence of Eq. (13), we choose a diﬀerent wave function functional

of the Coulomb hole sum rule requires the solution of a nonlinear integral Fredholm

equation of the ﬁrst kind for the determination of the function χ(R). We have solved [9]

the linearized version of this integral equation for χ(R). The satisfaction of the Coulomb

hole sum rule for typical electron positions for q = 1 is given in Table I. (We do not

plot the corresponding Coulomb holes as they are very similar to those of Figs. 1 and

2.) The wave function functional of Eq. (16) thus determined satisﬁes the normalization

constraint to the same degree of accuracy as that of the sum rule given in Table I. Hence,

the bijectivity of the normalization and Coulomb hole sum rules is demonstrated by example.

electron positions at (c)r = 0.8 (a.u.), and (d) r = 1.0 (a.u.). .

In conclusion, we have proved the bijectivity of the normalization and Fermi-Coulomb or

Coulomb hole sum rules for approximate wave functions. The bijectivity is also signiﬁcant

from a numerical perspective because it is much easier to normalize a wave function than to

ensure the satisfaction of the Fermi-Coulomb or Coulomb hole sum rules for each electron

position. As shown by the examples, the determination of a wave function functional via

normalization requires the solution of a quadratic equation, whereas that determined via

satisfaction of the Coulomb hole sum rule requires the solution of an integral equation. On

the other hand we note that the wave function functionals, as determined by satisfaction of

the diﬀerent sum rules, are diﬀerent. Hence, the Fermi-Coulomb and Coulomb holes, and

therefore how the electrons are correlated, will be diﬀerent depending upon which sum rule

is satisﬁed. It is unclear as to whether a better representation of the electron correlations

is achieved by satisfaction of the normalization sum rule or that of the Fermi-Coulomb

9

hole. Finally, the bijectivity explains the results of our analysis [11] of the Colle-Salvetti

wave function functional [12]. This wave function, which constitutes the basis for the most

extensively used correlation energy functional in the literature, is of the same form as that

of Eq.

(16) except that χ(R) = √πβ/(1 + √πβ), β = q[ρHF (R)]1/3.

In analyzing this

wave function we had noted that it was neither normalized nor did it satisfy the Coulomb

hole sum rule. These facts are consistent with the bijectivity theorem proved above. The

lack of satisfaction of either one of the constraints ensures the lack of satisfaction of the other.

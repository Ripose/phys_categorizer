(Dated: February 2, 2008)

Highly excited vibrational states of an isolated molecule encode the vibrational energy ﬂow path-
ways in the molecule. Recent studies have had spectacular success in understanding the nature of
the excited states mainly due to the extensive studies of the classical phase space structures and
their bifurcations. Such detailed classical-quantum correspondence studies are presently limited to
two or quasi two dimensional systems. One of the main reasons for such a constraint has to do
with the problem of visualization of relevant objects like surface of sections and Wigner or Husimi
distributions associated with an eigenstate. This necessiates various alternative techniques which
are more algebraic than geometric in nature. In this work we introduce one such method based on
parametric variation of the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian. It is shown that the level velocities are
correlated with the phase space nature of the corresponding eigenstates. A semiclassical expression
for the level velocities of a single resonance Hamiltonian is derived which provides theoretical sup-
port for the correlation. We use the level velocities to dynamically assign the highly excited states
of a model spectroscopic Hamiltonian in the mixed phase space regime. The eﬀect of bifurcations
on the level velocities is brieﬂy discussed using a recently proposed spectroscopic Hamiltonian for
the HCP molecule.

INTRODUCTION

Determining the nature of the highly excited rovibra-
tional states is important in the context of unraveling the
intramolecular vibrational energy redistribution (IVR)
pathways in molecules1,2,3,4,5,6,7. At high energies the
usual rigid rotor-harmonic oscillator descriptions are in-
adequate due to the breakdown of the normal mode ap-
proximation. The various normal modes get coupled
leading to complicated spectra and patterns. The under-
lying classical phase space usually has a mixed character
i.e., regular regions interspersed with the chaotic regions.
The mixed nature of the phase space gives rise to a va-
riety of phenomena, classical8 and quantum9, which in
turn lead to complex spectral patterns in terms of the
intensities and splittings.

Much of the recent work10,11,12,13,14,15,16 on small poly-
atomic molecules has clearly shown that the underlying
classical dynamics plays a signiﬁcant role in determining
In particular,
the nature of the highly excited states.
the various classical phase space structures like periodic
orbits, resonance zones and eﬀects like bifurcations16,17
leave their imprints on the eigenstates and hence provide
important clues to IVR. Almost all of the work has been
constrained to atmost two degrees of freedom systems.
One of the main reasons for such a constraint have to do
with the fact that visualizing the classical phase space
structures, for that matter even the quantum states, is
quite involved for systems with more than two degrees
of freedom. Moreover, determining the relevant periodic
orbits18 and higher dimensional objects like resonant 2-
tori becomes diﬃcult as the number of degrees of free-

dom increases. It is obvious that studying IVR in large
molecules from such useful classical-quantum correspon-
dence viewpoints would require one to come up with di-
mensionality independent techniques. Although not the
focus of the present work, it is important to note that
novel dynamical phenomena like Arnol’d diﬀusion19 and
complex instability20 arise in systems with dimensional-
ity greater than two. It remains to be seen wether such
eﬀects have important consequences for the classical-
quantum correspondence studies of highly excited states
and hence IVR.

In principle, once the detailed phase space structure
is at hand, the required information can be extracted
by correlating with a phase space representation of the
quantum states, like the Husimi21 or the Wigner22 distri-
butions. However, given that a detailed classical phase
space study of even three degree of freedom systems is
sparse23,24,25,26,27 suggests that the straightforward ap-
proach is far from easy. Ideally one would like a method
that yields the required information in a basis indepen-
dent fashion without the need to explicitly determine the
classical periodic orbits, to visualize the surface of sec-
tions and then comparing to the relevant phase space
distributions. The search for such a method, if it exists,
seems to be rather diﬃcult at the present moment. In
this work we attempt to provide a ﬁrst step towards such
an important yet diﬃcult goal.

The above mentioned factors clearly indicate that one
needs algebraic measures that would unambigously pro-
vide the information on the nature of the eigenstates.
To this end certain measures, time dependent and inde-
pendent, have been proposed in the literature. For in-
stance, inverse participation ratios28 (IPR) or dilution
factors can yield information about the nature of the
localization of the eigenstates. However IPR is a ba-
sis dependent quantity and cannot provide information
about the invariant classical structures relevant to the

eigenstate.
It is possible to extract useful information
by computing the IPR in diﬀerent basis which are opti-
mal and physically motivated5,29. An explicit expression
for the probability distribution of the IPR has been de-
rived very recently30. From a time-dependent point of
view valuable information can be obtained by comput-
ing various survival probabilities5,31,32. Insights regard-
ing the nature of the underlying classical phase space
have emerged from establishing the existence of corre-
lated intermediate timescale dynamics for rovibrational
Hamiltonians5,31. The role played by the various classical
structures in determining the nature of the survival prob-
abilities is well known33. Recently34 it has been proposed
that a dip in the level spacings is a characteristic spectral
pattern indicative of a seperatrix in the underlying clas-
sical phase space. This is an important observation for
ﬁtting the experimental spectrum with eﬀective Hamil-
tonians since seperatrices are indicative of qualitatively
diﬀerent dynamical behaviours coexisting in the system.
On the other hand, when the system Hamiltonian
is known, a number of authors have focused atten-
tion on parametric variation of the eigenvalues of the
system35,36,37. In particular, plots of the energy eigen-
values versus a perturbation parameter show very spe-
ciﬁc patterns for resonant systems36,37.
It is also well
known38,39,40 that the parametric variation of the eigen-
values of a system can be mapped onto a classical Hamil-
tonian system with the eigenvalues corresponding to the
positions of a set of ﬁctitious particles and the parame-
ter playing the role of a psuedotime. Within this map-
ping the slopes of the energy curves correspond to level
velocities40. Thus one associates a level velocity with
every eigenstate of the system. Signiﬁcant progress has
been made in studying the statistical properties of the
level velocities41 and the accelarations42 (curvatures). In
analogy with the random matrix theory (RMT) results
for eigenvalue statistics, the level velocity and curvatures
exhibit universal behaviours in the RMT limit40. For ex-
ample, in RMT the level velocities are found to be gaus-
sian distributed and a relation43 has been established be-
tween the IPR distribution and the level velocity distribu-
tion. Accordingly, deviations from the RMT limit result
in nonuniversal distributions signifying localization of the
eigenstates44,45,46,47. The preceeding discussion suggests
that it might be useful to explore the possibility of us-
ing the level velocities to understand the highly excited
states of an isolated molecule.

The purpose of this paper is to show that the level
velocity of an eigenstate is strongly correlated with the
phase space nature of the eigenstate. It will be demon-
strated that the magnitude and relative signs of the level
velocities give a direct indication of the important clas-
sical structures that inﬂuence the corresponding eigen-
states. Theoretical arguments for the correlation and nu-
merical support are provided in the next section for clas-
sically integrable, single resonance systems.
In section
III the level velocity “spectrum” of a nonintegrable, mul-
tiresonant system is studied. Combined with an earlier

2

work on the ﬁngerprints of resonances on the eigenlevel
dynamics it is possible to have an approximate dynam-
ical assignment of the eigenstates when the underlying
phase space is mixed. We conclude with a discussion of
the major advantages and disadvantages of our approach
and brieﬂy discuss the eﬀects of bifurcation on the level
velocities.

II. THEORETICAL BACKGROUND

In this section we introduce the level velocity spectrum
and provide arguments for the observed correlation be-
tween level velocities and the phase space nature of the
corresponding eigenstates. The arguments presented in
this section are strictly applicable only to single resonant
Hamiltonians. Nevertheless, we expect the arguments to
be valid for the multiresonant systems exhibiting mixed
phase space dynamics.

Consider the following n : m resonant Hamiltonian:

with Nj = (nj + 1/2) and (aj, a†

destruction and creation operators for the jth mode. The
eigenvalues and eigenstates of the Hamiltonian are de-
noted by E(τ ) and |α(τ )i respectively. The form of the
diagonal part of
H(τ ) is not restricted to the choice made
above and can include higher order anharmonicities as
well. The form of the Hamiltonian is that of an eﬀec-
tive or spectroscopic Hamiltonian and
H0 corresponds to
the Dunham expansion. Deﬁning the polyad operator48

the above expression for ˙xα(τ ; P ) is strongly reminiscient
of the Wigner function22. To make the correspondence
explicit the level velocity is written as:

1. The average of the level velocities for states belong-
ing to a given polyad P vanishes irrespective of the
coupling strength τ . This can be easily seen since

This fact gives rise to the “fan-like” structures in
the energy correlation diagram10,37 with the varia-
tion parameter being τ .

2. The level velocities exhibit

linear parametric
motion37 beyond a certain critical
coupling
strength τc. The critical coupling can be approxi-
mately determined via a Chirikov64 analysis. It has
been argued previously37 that the asymptotic ve-
locities for a 1 : 1 state |P ; νi are given by (P − 2ν).
In general, one does not expect the resonant cou-
pling strength in a molecule, to be close to τc. Con-
sequently the velocities, except for states localized
at or near the center of the resonance zone, do show
nonlinear parametric variation. However, as an ex-
ample we mention that the fermi resonance cou-
pling strength in the spectroscopic eﬀective Hamil-
tonian of the CHF3 molecule does come close to
the critical value49. For a general n : m reso-
nant Hamiltonian it was conjectured37, and numer-
ically conﬁrmed, that the velocity of the state |P ; 0i
scales with the polyad as P (m+n)/2.

It is clear that through the velocity one is studying the
response of the eigenstate to a speciﬁc perturbation. It is
not surprising that states localized in or near the speciﬁc
resonance zone would have the largest response. That
the response is strongly correlated to the phase space na-
ture of the eigenstate is interesting and we now provide
plausible reasons for such an observation. We note that
there has been an earlier work wherein similar correla-
tions were observed50.

ﬁcients. From a classical-quantum correspondence per-
spective it would be ideal to have a semiclassical expres-
sion for ˙xα(τ ; P ). The shifted overlap like structure in

Note that the Wigner function is the Weyl symbol of
the density operator. Although the system is two dimen-
sional it is suﬃcient to focus on an eﬀective one dimen-
sional Hamiltonian due to the existence of the polyad.
Thus (I, φ) are action-angle variables pertinent to the
classical limit of the reduced zeroth order Hamiltonian
(cf. appendix).
In particular, all of the expressions in
this section are for a given polyad P . This already sug-
gests the role played by classical phase space structures
since it is known54 that for integrable systems the Wigner
function condenses onto the invariant torus correspond-
ing to the eigenstate.

where Pc is the classical analog of P and the leading order
¯h term of Vnm(I/¯h−m/2; P ) is denoted by V (I; Pc). The
above semiclassical expression emphasizes the fact that
ﬁxed points of the classical Hamiltonian i.e., ˙I = 0 play
an important role in the level velocities. Moreover for a
single resonant Hamiltonian the phase term in the level
velocity expression is ±1 depending on the nature of the
ﬁxed point. Thus, relative signs of the level velocities
are important.
In the appendix further insight is pro-
vided on the polyad scaling of the velocities at such ﬁxed
points by a classical analysis of the function V (I; Pc).
Based on the above analysis it is expected that the level
velocities will be large in magnitude for states localized
around the various ﬁxed points. A similar expression for
the level velocity can be derived55 independently start-
ing from the Eq. (6) and following an approach based on
psuedodiﬀerential equations56.

To provide support for the theoretical arguments pre-
sented above consider an eﬀective 2-mode Hamiltonian
V1:1 which is 1 : 1 resonant with the pa-

and τ = 0.01. In order to determine the phase space na-
ture of the various eigenstates the Husimi distributions
are computed. Although one could compute the Wigner
functions associated with the states the Husimi functions
are preferred due to their smooth nature57.

In Fig. (1) we show the level velocities for the states
belonging to polyad P = 8. The three states which lie
inside the 1 : 1 resonance zone are indicated by the label
ν. It is easy to see that the coupling is below the critical
threshold since the velocity of the |8; 0i state is less than
the asymptotic value of 8. In Fig. (2) the Husimis as-
sociated with the states are shown superimposed on the
appropriate Poincar´e surface of sections. For the sake of
clarity only the contours with the maximum values are
shown. The state |8; 0i is localized on the stable periodic

ceeds to the states with higher ν the Husimi maximum
moves out of the island center and for the state |8; 2i
eventually localizes on the unstable periodic orbit i.e.,
around the seperatrix. It is important to note that the
state |8; 0i has a large positive velocity and the state |8; 2i
has a large negative velocity. This observation is consis-
tent with the results of the theoretical analysis. The rest
of the states in P = 8 are either local modes or distorted
local modes as evident from the Husimis in Fig. (2).

In order to further check the correlation between level
velocities and the phase space nature of the correspond-
ing states the velocities and Husimis are computed for
an integrable 2 : 1 system
V2:1 with the
coupling strength τ = 0.01. The level velocities for the
states belonging to the 2 : 1 polyad P = 14 are shown in
Fig. (3). Again it is clear that the coupling is below the
critical coupling and the level velocities show a charac-
teristic pattern. The state |14; 0i is expected to localize
around the 2 : 1 stable periodic orbit whereas the state
|14; 3i should be localized around the unstable periodic
orbit. The husimis shown in Fig. (4) essentially conﬁrm
the expectations. In both the integrable cases, for cou-
pling strengths near or above the critical value, the level
velocities are large positive for the state in the center of
the resonance island and equally large but negative for
the seperatrix state. Thus the relative signs of the level
velocities are crucial and provide information on the ﬁxed
points that dictate the phase space nature of the eigen-
states. The absolute sign is clearly unimportant since
a change in the sign of the coupling would interchange
the signs of the velocities. In addition the state localized
about the stable periodic orbit exhibits linear parametric
motion and the velocity is closer to the classical value,

The results of this section clearly indicate that the level
velocities associated with the eigenstates are correlated to
the structures in the classical phase space. In the follow-
ing sections additional numerical examples are provided
which highlight the correlation and the potential for us-
ing the level velocities to assign highly excited states of

III. APPLICATION TO NONINTEGRABLE
SYSTEMS

The states of single resonant Hamiltonians studied in
the previous section can be assigned in various ways.
Complications due to bifurcations can be sorted out15,17
with a detailed study of the classical-quantum correspon-
dence for the system. However with the addition of an-
other independent resonance the polyad constant of the
motion is destroyed and assignments of the states be-
comes a nontrivial task. The underlying classical phase
space can exhibit a rich variety of dynamics ranging from
the near-integrable to the mixed to full chaos. An im-
portant observation that has emerged from the various
studies10,12,13,14,15,16 is that classical phase space struc-
tures can form the basis for a dynamical assignment of
the various eigenstates of the system. The advantage of
such a dynamical assignment is that it is based on invari-
ant structures and directly reﬂects the relevant molecular
motions in some energy range of interest. More impor-
tantly, such dynamical assignments are possible over the
entire range of the phase space dynamics. For instance,
a completely chaotic phase space at the outset seems
to preclude any meaningful assignment of the states.
Even for such hard chaotic systems it is wellknown that
the eigenstates can be localized due to various quantum
and classical eﬀects58,60,61,62,63. A prime example is the
scarring58 of the eigenstates by the periodic orbits which
has been studied in great detail59 over the years. In this
case the relevant periodic orbits provide an avenue to

dynamically assign the eigenstates.

From the perspective of studying IVR in isolated
molecules a key observation is that the underlying phase
space overwhelmingly belongs to the class of mixed dy-
namics. The fact that the eﬀective spectroscopic Hamil-
tonians used to gain insights into IVR have the struc-
ture of a hierarchical local random matrix5 is largely re-
sponsible for the mixed nature of the phase space. Dy-
namical assignment of the highly excited eigenstates in
such mixed phase space regimes is important and highly
relevant. A signiﬁcant bottleneck to such a classical-
quantum correspondence based approach arises for sys-
tems with dimensionality greater than two. Any dynam-
ical assignment of the eigenstates necessarily involves
ﬁnding the important classical structures in the phase
space and correlating them with the eigenstates or some
phase space representation of the eigenstates. Already
for a three degree of freedom system the Poincar´e sur-
face of section24 is four dimensional and so is the com-
puted Wigner or Husimi distribution of the eigenstates.
This leads to diﬀculties in visually correlating the states
with appropriate classical objects. One way to overcome
this problem is to have algebraic measures and in this re-
gard the results of the previous section suggest the level
velocities as one possible candidate.

In order to assess the utility of the level velocities in
providing a dynamical assignment of the eigenstates a
model two resonance eﬀective Hamiltonian
H0 +
V2:1 is chosen. The parameters of the ze-
τ11
roth order Hamiltonian are as given in the previous sec-
tion. The resonant coupling strengths are chosen to be
τ11 = τ21 = 0.01. The Hamiltonian is nonintegrable and
the energy range [8, 9] is chosen as an example since the
phase space exhibits mixed dynamics. The level veloc-
ities ˙xα(τ11) and ˙xα(τ21) are computed for some of the
eigenstates in the selected energy range. Note that in the
nonintegrable case the velocities can be expressed as:

where σE is the variance of the velocities and h ˙xαi is the
average of the level velocities. This is done since the ve-
locities scale diﬀerently with the polyad P and we would
like to compare the two velocities for a given eigenstate.
The scaled velocities are dimensionless, zero centered and
have unit variance.

In Fig. (5) we show the scaled level velocity spectrum
for selected eigenstates in the energy range [8, 9]. In Ta-

that a low value signiﬁes extensive mixing in the basis of

and hence nonresonant. The scaled velocities
˙xα(τ21) are both very small indicating the local nature
of these states. Note also that the IPRs are close to one
e
in every basis for these set of states. As an example, the
husimi of state 94 superimposed on the surface of section
is shown in Fig. (6a). The zeroth order quantum numbers
(n1, n2) are good quantum numbers for the local mode
states. In Table I such states are denoted by ’l’.

e

B. Distorted local mode states

As suggested by the name the distorted local mode
states (69,71,91) are states that are lying close to either
one of the resonance zones. Thus the husimi distribution
of such states are distorted but topologically nonreso-
nant. One such example is shown in Fig. (6b) for the
state 71. The level velocities clearly indicate the partic-
ular resonance zone to which the states are in proximity.
This is precisely the reason that the state 71 is labeled as
’dl11’. The IPR values are also high and essentially agree
with the assignments from the level velocity spectrum.
The zeroth order quantum numbers are not so good a la-
bel for these distorted states. It is also possible to think
of these states as a kind of ’borderline’ states and hence
a slight increase in the appropriate resonance coupling
strength will render them resonant.

FIG. 6: Husimis for selected states superimposed on the cor-
responding surface of sections. See the text for details.

C. Resonant states

˙xα(τ11) and comparitively negligible

The resonant states (68,70,75,77,80,85,86,88,96,98,99)
show up in the velocity spectrum in Fig. (5) as states
with large positive or negative velocities. In accordance
with our discussions in the previous sections these states
are localized in one or the other resonance zone. More-
over states with large positive velocity are expected to
be localized about the corresponding stable periodic or-
bit. On the other hand states with large negative veloci-
ties are expected to be localized about the corresponding
seperatrix region. For example state 85 has a large pos-
˙xα(τ21). Con-
itive
sequently this state is anticipated to be localized exclu-
sively in the 1 : 1 resonance zone and the Husimi distri-
bution to be localized about the 1 : 1 resonance island in
the underlying phase space. That this is indeed the case
is conﬁrmed in Fig. (6e). Thus state 85 is labeled by ’s’
indicating localization about the stable periodic orbit. In
Table I we have also appended a label P11 suggesting that
the particular 1 : 1 polyad P11 is almost a good quantum
number to assign the state. Similarly state 96 is local-
ized about the 2 : 1 island according to the level velocities
and Fig. (6g) supports the assignment. An approximate
polyad P21 is also attached to this state.

e

e

In order to complete the assignment the approximate
polyads P11 and P21 need to be determined. To this end it
is useful to examine the partial level velocities ˙xα(τ ; P ) as
a function of P for the corresponding states. P is chosen
appropriately for the particular resonance. Thus, P =
n1+n2 for the 1 : 1 resonance and P = 2n1+n2 for the 2 :
1 resonance. It is important to note that this information
is obtained enroute to computing the level velocity of a
state and does not require a seperate computation. In

Fig. (7e,g) the partial velocities are shown for states 85
and 96 respectively. It is clear from the ﬁgure that P11 =
10 and P21 = 14. A similar analysis can be done on all
the states and as an example the partial velocities are
shown in Fig. (7a) for the state 94. One can immediately
assign this local mode state as (n1, n2) = (0, 15)

Once the resonant states with large positive velocities
have been assigned the rest of the resonant states can
be easily assigned as shown in Table I. Two important
properties of the level velocities guide the assignments.
The ﬁrst property is that for positive coupling constants
the states localized about the stable periodic orbits with
some approximate polyad P are energetically higher than
the states localized about the unstable periodic orbits be-
longing to P . Exceptions can occur due to bifurcations
and this is discussed in the following section. Secondly,
velocity of states with some approximate P scale diﬀer-
ently with P for the 1 : 1 and the 2 : 1 resonances. Thus
states belonging to the 2 : 1 resonance are seperated more
as compared to the states belonging to the 1 : 1 reso-
nance. A Chirikov64 like estimate is also an indicator of
the number of states bound by the resonance. Moreover,
studying the partial velocities helps in conﬁrming the as-
signments. In Figs. (6c,f) we show the Husimi distribu-
tions for the states 77 and 70 respectively. The Husimis
are localized in the chaotic regions corresponding to the
integrable limit seperatricies and lend support to the as-
signments in Table I where the label ’u’ is used to denote
such states.

avoided crossing between states 103 and 104 as a function of

work for τ11 = τ21 = 0.01.

D. Mixed states

There are a few states (74,93,100,103) which cannot
be assigned in a straightforward fashion. As an example
state 74 according to the IPR values should be predom-
inantly a 2 : 1 resonant state. However the level veloc-
ities show the opposite trend. In Fig. (6h) we show the
Husimi for state 74 superimposed on the surface of sec-
tion. It is clear that the state is delocalized over both the
chaotic as well as the regular regions of the phase space
as compared to the other states in Fig. (6). The Husimi,
however, is peaked in the 2 : 1 regions of the phase space
in agreement with the IPR values. These observations
are symptomatic of avoided crossings since at an avoided
crossing regular and chaotic states can mix. Indeed on
examining the variation of the eigenvalues with the 2 : 1
coupling parameter τ21, shown in Fig. (8a), it is seen
that the state 74 is involved in an avoided crossing with
the regular state 75. The important observation is that

the state 74 is located close to the center of the avoided
crossing. This explains the low value for the velocity
˙xα(τ21) and the apparent diﬃculty in the assignment of
the state 74. The partial velocities for the state 74 shown
e
in Fig. (7h) clearly demonstrate the delocalized nature of
the state. The assignment of the state 93 is complicated
due to similar reasons. The states 100 and 101 are also
close to being involved in an avoided crossing.
In this
case the velocities can be used to provide a nominal as-
signment.

On the other hand states 103 and 104 are again close
to being involved in an avoided crossing as shown in
Fig. (8b). Note that the parameter being varied in
Fig. (8b) is the 1 : 1 coupling strength τ11. The husimi
distribution for the state 103 is shown in Fig. (6i) and
looks topologically very much like the case in Fig. (6d)
except for the peak in the 2 : 1 region. Again the level
velocities can be used to nominally assign the state 103
as a 1 : 1 state belonging to the polyad P11 + 1. Thus the
mixed states arising in this energy range are primarily
due to two state avoided crossings.

IV. DISCUSSION AND SUMMARY

The main focus of the present work is to come up with
techniques which would allow a dynamical assignment of
highly excited states of multiresonant, multidimensional
(> 2) Hamiltonians. It is well known that an intimate
knowledge of the various classical phase space structures
is the ﬁrst important step towards such dynamical as-
signments. However obtaining a detailed picture, akin to
the two dimensional systems, of the phase space struc-
ture for systems with three or larger degrees of freedom
is diﬀcult. In this paper we have argued that the phase
space nature of an eigenstate is encoded in the manner
that it responds to variation of speciﬁc parameters of
the Hamiltonian. In other words, the level velocity as-
sociated with an eigenstate is strongly correlated to the
phase space nature of the eigenstate. Theoretical argu-
ments for the observed correlation have been provided for
single resonant systems. In a way the current work be-
gins to provide a basis for understanding and utilizing the
usual energy correlation diagrams. We have shown the
utility of the level velocities in a dynamical assignment
of the highly excited states of a 2-mode multiresonant
Hamiltonian. It is important to point out here that our
approach does not require explicit determination of the
periodic orbits for the system. It is equally relevant to
mention that the level velocity approach is independent
of the dimensionality of the system and is manifestly ba-
sis invariant. Thus the current work is a ﬁrst step in
coming up with algebraic measures facilitating the study
of the classical-quantum correspondence for multidimen-
sional systems.

The method proposed in this paper for the dynamical
assignment of highly excited states, however, has a few
weakpoints. Firstly, it is quite possible for the level ve-

locity of a particular eigenstate to be close to zero. For
example, for coupling strengths near the critical value,
the 1 : 1 state |6; 3i will exhibit zero velocity. Assign-
ing such states solely on the basis of level velocities will
be problematic. Secondly, as demonstrated in the last
section, states involved in an avoided crossing can pose
problems for the assignment as well. This is not surpris-
ing since such states are diﬃcult to assign by any of the
existing methods. Nevertheless, taking linear combina-
tions of the two states and assigning the demixed states
is one possible solution. In both instances it is still pos-
sible to gain insights into the states by examining other
measures like the IPRs in conjunction with the level ve-
locities.

One of the important issues that we have not addressed
has to do with the eﬀect of the various bifurcations15,16,17

explicitly shown the important role played by the ﬁxed
points in the classical phase space as far as the level ve-
locities are concerned. Bifurcations24,51 are associated
with creation or destruction of ﬁxed points and hence
signal qualitative change in the dynamics. Thus, it is
clear that the level velocities would be quite sensitive
to bifurcations. Work is in progress in our group to
study the ﬁngerprints of bifurcations on the level ve-
locity spectrum in a sytematic fashion. However, we
conclude this paper by showing some preliminary work
on the HCP molecule in order to gauge the utility of
the level velocities. We have chosen HCP as an exam-

ple due to the fact that the system has been investi-
gated experimentally65 and thoroughly studied from the
classical-quantum perspective15,16. The eﬀective spec-
troscopic Hamiltonian66 for HCP involves a 1 : 2 Fermi
resonant coupling between the bend and the CP stretch.
Thus there exists a polyad67 P = v2 + 2v3 with v2 and
v3 refering to the bend and the CP stretch modes re-
spectively. The states can be assigned in terms of the
vibrational angular momentum, the number of quanta in
the CH stretch (v1), and the polyad P . Further for ev-
ery given P there are P/2 + 1 levels indexed by i = 0
at the top of the polyad and i = P/2 at the bottom of
It has been established66 that for v1 = 0
the polyad.
and up to P = 14 the states evolve smoothly from be-
ing pure CP stretch at the bottom of the polyads to be-
ing approximately pure bend at the top of the polyads.
However starting at P = 18 a new family of states,
called isomerization states, come into existence due to
a saddle node bifurcation of the periodic orbits. Above
P = 22 the isomerization states are almost pure bend
and closely follow the minimum energy path leading from
HCP to CPH15. Keeping this information in mind in
Fig. (9) we show the unscaled level velocity spectrum cor-
responding to polyads P = 14, 18, 22, and 32 for the HCP
molecule. It is crucial to note that for the eﬀective spec-
troscopic Hamiltonian ﬁt the Fermi resonant coupling is
negative66. We thus anticipate a large negative velocity
for the state localized around the stable periodic orbit. It
is also known that for low polyad values there are two sta-
ble periodic orbits denoted by [r] and [B]. The velocity
spectrum for P = 14 shown in Fig. (9a) clearly indicates
that the i = 0 state is localized around the [B] periodic
orbit. From our theoretical analysis and the appendix we
expect the state associated with the [r] periodic orbit to
have a very small velocity which is conﬁrmed in Fig. (9a)
for state i = 7. The velocity spectrum suggests that most
of the states are resonant and indeed the classical esti-
mate (−28.51) (cf. Eq. (27b)) for the velocity of the state
i = 0 is very close to the computed value (−26.36). In
Fig. (9b) the velocity spectrum is shown for P = 18. For
this case we clearly see a pertubation in the spectrum in
the positive velocity region and the resulting isomeriza-
tion state is labeled as I. The negative velocity region
is unperturbed. The perturbation is quite prominent in
Figs. (9c,d) corresponding to the P = 22 and the P = 32
cases. In every case the velocity of the [B] state is close
to the classical estimate. Given that the negative portion
of the velocity spectrum is unperturbed we conclude that
the bifurcation is creating a stable periodic orbit (SN )
and an unstable periodic orbit (SN ) at ψ = π/2 in the
reduced phase space. Thus the isomerization states form
a sequence from being localized about the SN periodic
orbit to the SN periodic orbit. In this instance as the
saddle node bifurcation creates the stable/unstable pair
at the same angle ψ = π/2 the level velocities for states
localized about both the periodic orbits are expected to
be large positive. The caricature of the phase space just
described agrees well with the earlier studies16,66. It is

10

clear that the level velocity spectrum is correlated with
the phase space structure and capable of detecting non-
trivial changes in the phase space due to the bifurcations.
This work is a ﬁrst step towards developing tools
suitable for studying classical-quantum correspondence
in multidimensional systems. The systems studied in
this paper are certainly encouraging and warrant fur-
ther study of the level velocities and diﬀerent measures
based on the level velocities. One such sensitive measure
has been proposed recently47 which correlates the level
velocities with the eigenstate resolved spectrum of the
molecule in order to gain insights into the IVR process.
Currently we are exploring the utility of the level veloc-
ities in assigning the states of three degree of freedom
multiresonant Hamiltonians which are eﬀectively two di-
mensional due to the existence of a superpolyad num-
ber. Spectroscopic Hamiltonians have been determined
for many such eﬀectively two dimensional systems like
H2O68, CHBrClF69, and DCO70. Preliminary studies71
on such systems indicate that the level velocity spectrum
is well suited for the purpose of dynamical assignment of
the eigenstates. Studies are also underway of true three
degree of freedom systems in order to test the approach
and for insights into the highly excited states of such
systems from the classical- quantum correspondence per-
spectives.

Appendix: Classical insight into the level velocities

In this appendix we provide a classical argument for
the scaling of the level velocities with the polyad P for a
general single resonance Hamiltonian.

The n : m resonant Hamiltonian corresponding to the

classical limit of the quantum Hamiltonian is:

H(I, θ) = H0(I) + 2τ I m/2

cos(mθ1 − nθ2)

ating function

with

V (I; Pc) = I m/2

(cid:17)

(cid:16)

(22)

The action Pc is a constant of the motion since the
Hamiltonian is ignorable in the angle conjugate to Pc.
Pc = n/mI1 + I2 is the classical analog of the polyad
number.

The ﬁxed points in the (I, φ) plane correspond to pe-
riodic orbits in the full phase space. Using ˙I = 0 = ˙φ
we obtain the ﬁxed points as ¯φ = 0, ±π/m. The solution
¯I = 0 is discarded since it is unphysical and the other
root of ¯I is of no interest here since that corresponds to
all the excitation in the ﬁrst mode. Using the value of
the angle φ at the ﬁxed points the corresponding actions
are obtained by a solution to the algebraic equation:

∂H0
∂I

± 2τ g(I; Pc) = 0

(23)

where

g(I; Pc) =

dV (I; Pc)
dI

(24)

This nonlinear equation is solved numerically to obtain
the periodic orbits of the system.

In this appendix, however, attention is focused on the

analysis of the function

v(I, φ; Pc) =

= 2V (I; Pc) cos mφ

(25)

∂H
∂τ

which occurs in the semiclassical approximation Eq. (14)
for the quantum level velocities. Interest in this function
arises from exploring the maximum and minimum values
that this function can take at the ﬁxed points in the (I, φ)

11

space. Inspecting the I and φ derivative of v(I, φ; Pc)

∂
∂φ
∂
∂I

v(I, φ; Pc) = −2mV (I; Pc) sin mφ

(26a)

v(I, φ; Pc) = 2g(I; Pc) cos mφ

(26b)

it is clear that the critical points in the φ variable
are identical with those of the ﬁxed points.
The
critical points arising from the I variable are ¯I =
0, (m/n)Pc, m2Pc/n(m + n).
Note that demanding
g(I; Pc) = 0 is tantamount to being on the center of the
resonance line and hence the stable periodic orbit. The
ﬁrst two critical values give rise to zero velocities and cor-
respond to the “edge” states in a given polyad multiplet.
The third critical point gives rise to the velocities:

v( ¯I (3), 0; Pc) = −v( ¯I (3), π/m; Pc)

= 2

(1 + µ)n+m (cid:21)

(27a)

P (m+n)/2

c

(27b)

where, µ = n/m. From the above one immediately sees
that the classical object takes the same absolute value at
the stable and unstable ﬁxed points. Moreover, the clas-
sical analog exhibits the identical scaling with the polyad
Pc as seen in exact quantum studies done previously. In
fact it is seen in the quantum studies that the resonant
eigenstate |P ; νi with ν = 0 i.e., state localized on the
stable ﬁxed point shows very good agreement with the
above classical estimate.

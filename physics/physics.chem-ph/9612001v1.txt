Abstract

We apply the time-dependent local density approximation (TDLDA) to cal-

culate dipole excitations in small carbon molecules. Linear chains are found to

have a strong low-frequency mode which varies with chain size as the classical

resonance of a conducting needle; here the theory agrees well with observation

on Cn molecules in the range n = 3

15. The lowest collective transition in

−
rings occurs at about twice the frequency, which may also be understood in

simple terms. TDLDA also explains a weak transition found in even-n chains

at the frequency of the HOMO-LUMO gap.

I. INTRODUCTION

The time-dependent local density approximation (TDLDA) has been shown to be a

reliable tool to calculate strong transitions in the optical response of metallic clusters [1] as

well as fullerines [2]. In this work we examine light carbon molecules, which have a rather

complex structural evolution as a function of the number of atoms [3]. Small molecules are

linear, and at higher n rings are favored. For intermediate n values, rings are more favored

at even n and linear chains at odd n.

Part of the interest in this problem comes from astrophysics, the question of the com-

position of interstellar matter. Absorption bands are seen which may be due to carbon

molecules, but speciﬁc identiﬁcation of species remains controversial [4,5].

We shall show that the linear chains and rings have a systematic behavior, much of which

can be understood in terms of a classical polarizability. Section 2 presents the TDLDA

results, and the interpretation follows in Section 3.

II. TDLDA

The optical response of the light chains C3−5 and C7 has been calculated with the

conﬁguration-interaction method of quantum chemistry [6,7], but this brute-force technique

is impractical in large molecules. We are interested in the strength distribution of the strong

transitions, and the TDLDA is well-suited for this purpose. There are many numerical tech-

niques for applying the TDLDA theory [8,9]. We favor a coordinate space method, with

which we have studied clusters of up to 150 atoms [10]. The important numerical parame-

ters are the mesh size, ∆x, the number of mesh points M, the time step ∆t, and the total

length of time integration T . These parameters are given in the ﬁgure captions. With the

numerics under control, the electronic calculation is speciﬁed by the electron Hamiltonian

and the positions of the ionic cores. We consider only the 4 valence electrons in carbon,

and take their interaction with the ionic core according to the pseudopotential prescrip-

2

tions [11,12]. The electron-electron interaction in the local density approximation has an

exchange-correlation energy from ref. [13].

In principle the geometry should be determined by minimizing the ground state energy.

However, our interest is in electronic structure, and we therefore take geometries from outside

rather than calculating ab initio.

Before calculating the carbon molecules, we ﬁrst looked at the benzene spectrum, as a

further check on the method. The experimental optical response of benzene [14] is shown

in Fig. 1a), compared with the TDLDA in Fig. 1b). The large broad feature peaked at

18 eV in the spectrum is associated with the σ electrons. The narrower peak at 6.9 eV is

the collective resonance of the π electrons, and the TDLDA reproduces its energy to within

a few percent. The measured strength of the peak [15], including the right-hand shoulder

up to 8.3 eV (but not the left-hand shoulder) is f=0.9. TDLDA predicts f=1.1, which we

consider satisfactory agreement.

We now turn to the pure carbon molecules. For simplicity, we ﬁxed the nearest neighbor

distance of the carbon atoms at 1.28 ˚A. This is the average LDA equilibrium distance for large

circular rings or long chains. The dipole moment of the excited molecule was ﬁrst calculated

in real-time TDLDA, and the strength function is obtained by Fourier transforming. The

response of a typical case, C7, is shown in Fig. 2. The upper curve shows the integrated

transition strength for an electric ﬁeld along the axis of the chain, and the lower curve

shows the perpendicular response. The longitudinal response has a strong excitation at 5.2

eV. Of the total strength of f = 28, about 1/3 is in this excitation. The perpendicular

response has no corresponding strong excitation below 10 eV. The small wiggles in the

calculated response are artifacts of the truncation in the Fourier transformation. The total

sum rule (f = 4n, four valence electrons per carbon atom), is satisﬁed to within 10% by the

calculation, the deviation due to the nonlocality of the carbon pseudopotential. Our results

for all the molecules we examined are given in Table I.

The systematics of the frequency of the longitudinal mode in linear chains is shown in

Fig. 3 The boxes are experimental points for odd n from ref. [16]. We see rather good

3

agreement. C5 has been calculated by the CI method of quantum chemistry [7], and the

predicted strong transition is in the same region, at 6.8 eV. The curve in Fig. 3 is a classical

parameterization, given by eq. (1) below. This will be discussed in the next section.

Ref. [16] also reported weaker transitions in odd-n chains at lower energy. The authors

in ref. [17,18] observe transitions in heavier even-n molecules which fall within the same

systematics as the weak odd-n transitions. We believe that the even-n transitions may be

associated with the single-particle excitation spectrum. The single-particle response, or free

response, of C10 is shown in Fig. 4. There are two transitions at about 2 eV, roughly

half the frequency of the collective excitation. The interaction pushes one state up to the

collective frequency, and transfers almost all the strength to it. The lower state remains at

about the same frequency and is too weak to be seen in the TDLDA real-time response.

The systematics of the low transition, compared to the free response, is shown in Fig. 5.

No states are reported for even-n chains at the position we predict for the strong tran-

sitions. We are conﬁdent that the strength is there, but perhaps it is fragmented by the

higher level density in the even n and thus not readily identiﬁed.

We have also made a study of some ring conﬁgurations. Although calculated ring struc-

tures may have some distortion [19], we assume for simplicity circular rings in all cases. The

ring response for in-plane excitation shows a single peak below below 10 eV, at a resolution

of 0.5 eV. The excitation energies are shown in Fig. 6. Thus, the ring is predicted to have

an excitation energy about twice that of the chain conﬁguration.

These are our main results;

in the next section we oﬀer an interpretation based on

classical physics and sum rules.

III. INTERPRETATION

Our basis for interpreting the behavior will be the estimate for the frequency of a collec-

tive excitation [20],

ω2 =

2
¯h

mα

where N is the number of active electrons and α is the polarizability. The number of active

electrons N is given by the total oscillator strength associated with the transition. For

the linear carbon chains, N should be just the number of π electrons; the σ electrons only

contribute to the response at higher frequency. This simple picture can be assessed by

comparing with the oscillator strength associated with the free response of the molecules.

These numbers are given in Table I, which also shows that the oscillator strength of the

collective TDLDA excitation is very nearly the same as the free electron oscillator strength

for the HOMO-LUMO transition. Let us take as an example the molecule C7.

In the

free electron picture, the excitation is a pure particle-hole state with energy given by the

diﬀerence in single-particle energies. The oscillator strength associated with that transition

is 10.2 form Table I. In the collective excitation, the transition strength is 9.8, only a few

percent lower than in the free particle response. These numbers should be compared with

the number of π electrons. Filling the molecular orbitals in the usual way, the number for

odd-n chains is N = 2n

2, equal to 12 for C7. Thus taking N to be the total number of

−

valence electrons overestimates the strength by about 20%. This implies that that amount

of strength goes out of the valence manifold of states.

A longitudinal electric ﬁeld in a linear carbon chain excites π electrons only within the

π manifold of states, but the ﬁeld makes π

σ and π

δ transitions as well if the chain

→
is curved. Thus not all of the sum rule will be in the π manifold for the ring conﬁgurations.

→

A simple geometric estimate gives a reduction factor of 1/2. Again, we check how well this

simple picture works by comparing with the oscillator strength associated with the single-

particle response. For rings, the number of π electrons is given by N = 2n. Taking as an

example the 10-atom ring, the number of π electrons is 10, to be compared with f = 9.8

from Table I. Evidently the good agreement must be do to compensating factors in the

negect of transitions to states outside the π manifold.

We now turn to the polarizability α. Our basic physical assumption leading to eq. (9)

below, is that the chain of atoms is a perfect conductor. Then the electrons will move in

an external ﬁeld to keep the total electric ﬁeld along the chain zero. This gives an implicit

A similar functional dependence is found for plasmon s in inﬁnitely long one-dimensional

wires, as a function of longitudinal wavenumber q [21,22]. The polarizability of an ellipsoidal

conductor can be calculated analytically [23]. Combining this with the relation between N

and the plasmon frequency ω0, one obtains the following formula for the frequency of the

This has been applied to the longitudinal mode in fullerines [8]. Its asymptotic behavior

is given by eq. (11) above. As was shown in Fig. 3, eq. (9) gives a very good ﬁt to the

energies of the longitudinal excitation in the linear chains.

We ﬁnally discuss the relative frequencies of the modes in chains and rings. This requires

estimating the integrals in eq. (5) and (6) more accurately. For deﬁniteness, let us assume

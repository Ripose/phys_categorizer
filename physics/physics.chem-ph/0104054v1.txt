A soliton model for proton conductivity in Langmuir ﬁlms is presented. The model
contains three real scalar ﬁelds describing the hydrogen involved in the conduction, the hy-
drophilic head of the Langmuir ﬁlm, and the water. Soliton solutions that describe proton
motion along the hydrogen bonds are found. Under compression of the ﬁlm, the distance
between the minima of the proton potential and the strength of the hydrogen bonds be-
tween the ﬁlm molecule and the water are changed. Such changes increase the probability
of soliton creation. The model presented allows proton conductivity data in Langmuir ﬁlms
to be explained.

Research on the characterization of Langmuir ﬁlms has led to the identiﬁcation of a critical packing density,
below which some properties of the system change signiﬁcantly [1–7]. In particular, measurements of lateral
conductance in Langmuir ﬁlms suggested the authors of Ref. [8,9] to postulate the conductance arises from
proton transfer via the presence of hydrogen bonds in the ﬁlm network. The likelihood of this assumption
is supported by the fact that in most of such ﬁlms there is no room for ionic or electronic conduction.

There are few theoretical eﬀorts to understand the mechanisms behind such protonic conductance; see
Ref. [10] and references therein. In Ref. [10] the issue is addressed via a simple unidimensional mechanism
for proton transfer in the hydrogen bonds.
In this model, the two oxygen atoms involved in the proton
transfer are treated equivalently. This is an approximation, because one oxygen belongs to a water molecule,
and the other to a hydrophilic headgroup.

In the present work another model is proposed based on the soliton models of Refs. [11–13]. The model of
Ref. [11] deals with proton conduction in quasi-unidimensional networks that arise due to hydrogen bonds.
This model corresponds to a two-component chain, the proton subchain and the heavy nuclei subchain
connected by the hydrogen bonds. It describes two real scalar ﬁelds, φ = φ(x, t) and χ = χ(x, t), in two-
dimensional space-time. These ﬁelds correspond to the lighter (φ) and heavier (χ) subchains, respectively.
The interactions between the two sublattices is described by the potential U = U (φ, χ), a functional of the
two ﬁelds.

A related problem to the two-component chain is the diatomic one, which is modeled in Ref. [12]. The
model introduces a derivative coupling between the two elements that form the diatomic chain. This model
was further investigated in Ref. [13], where ideas of [11,12,14] are combined to incorporate the derivative
coupling between the lighter and heavier subchains of the two-component model. It was used to investigate
hydrogen-bonded systems. The model describes quasi-unidimensional systems that can be represented by
repetitions of the basic entity X − H · · ·, where H and X represent the proton and the heavy nuclei, and

− and · · · the covalent and the hydrogen bond, respectively. The simplest example is water [11], where X
stands for OH. We can think of one-component and two-component models, but the two-component model
is more realistic, because the network is visualized as a diatomic chain, composed of two sublattices, the
lighter sublattice describing the protons, and the heavier sublattice the heavier component of the system.
Langmuir ﬁlms are spread and compressed on an aqueous subphase (substrate in our case), and we recall
that the experimental measurements in such ﬁlms are in general done at room temperature. The ﬁlm is
considered an isolated system, having no interference from the water substrate. The water substrate only
provides hydration water that participates in the H-bond network. In the model, we do not have to assusme
any speciﬁc crystaline structure for the hydrated water.

The main goal of the present work is to oﬀer a new model to understand the proton conductivity problem
in Langmuir ﬁlms. This model appears through the hydrogen bonds that connect the hydrophilic head of the
ﬁlm molecules to the water, leading to a mechanism that allows the presence of solitons, that drive the proton
motion in the network. To do this, we ﬁrst extend the model of Ref. [13] to the case of a three-component
chain, which seems to be more appropriate to the investigation of such ﬁlms. The three-component network
in the Langmuir ﬁlms can be schematically represented by repetitions of X − H · · · Y − H · · ·. It is composed
of protons and the X and Y groups that represent OH and the amphiphilic molecule that characterizes the
ﬁlm, respectively. They are spatially represented in Fig. 1 in the case of the aliphatic acid.

We justify a three-component model for such system recalling that even when one neglects the tail con-
tribution to the motion of the head, it is much heavier than the water counterpart. The proton subchain is
much lighter than the other two subchains, so we consider the lighter sublattice coupled with each one of
the two other sublattices. We assume the two heavier sublattices do not interact with one another by any
other mechanism. That is, the ﬁlm molecules only interaction with the water is via the hydrogen bonds.

Our model uses three real scalar ﬁelds φ, χ, and ψ, in bidimensional space-time. φ = φ(x, t) describes
translational motion of protons, and χ = χ(x, t) and ψ = ψ(x, t) the motion of OH groups and amphiphilic
molecule subchains, respectively. We use standard notation, with xα = (t, x), xα = (t, −x), and ¯h = c = 1.

The parameters µ1, µ2, and ν1, ν2 are real and positive, and U = U (φ, χ, ψ) is the potential. Here we consider
the protons as unit mass particles, so the parameters µ1 and µ2 can represent the mass ratio between the
OH group and the hydrogen, and the amphiphilic molecule and the hydrogen. The other two parameters
ν1 and ν2 describe the derivative coupling between the proton and water and the proton and amphiphilic
molecule, respectively.

In Ref. [13] the derivative coupling between the two heavier subchains was considered in the two-component
model there studied. In the present work we are considering the three-component model just introduced,
and no coupling between the two heavier subchains is taken into account, since they seem to couple mainly
through the hydrogen bonds. We follow this reasoning and neglect further couplings between the χ and ψ
ﬁelds in the potential. Also the complexity of the problem can be reduced by assuming the heavier subchains
contribute insigniﬁcantly to the potential, at least when compared to the lighter subchain. Therefore, in this
approximation U = U (φ) depends only on the mobility of the proton ﬁeld, which yields to

where A is a real and positive dimensionless parameter, λ is also real and has dimension length−1. U (φ) has
minima located at ¯φ± = ± A and the barrier height λ2 A4/2. Since the parameter A gives the minima of the
potential, it is directly related to the distance between neighbor oxygens in the ﬁlm network. This allows
the presence of two degenerate ground states, one with all the protons at the position A, and the other with
the protons at −A. These two states can be represented by repetitions of the basic entities

The presence of two degenerate minima allows the appearance of solitons, which are extended solutions with
ﬁnite energy that connect the two degenerate ground states.

To investigate the presence of soliton solutions, we notice that in the present model the ﬁrst-order equation

(16) becomes

It is solved to give the kink solutions

(cid:1)

(cid:0)
Here ¯x stands for λx, and is dimensionless. The parameters A and B determine the energy (4/3)A3 B−1,
and the width l ∼ B/A of the soliton solutions. A is related to the distance between neighbor oxygens in
the H-bond network. It is an important parameter because under compression, conductivity and surface
potential of the ﬁlm change signiﬁcantly when the critical area per head group limit is reached [1–7]. B is
an eﬀective parameter, that depends on the fundamental parameters µ1, µ2, ν1, ν2 in a speciﬁc way, imposed
by the ﬁeld-theoretical model here considered. Although our model is microscopic, we can think of B as a
phenomenological parameter, used to infer the width and the energy of the soliton solutions. The soliton
solutions spring in responce to nonlinear eﬀects, and describe proton mobility in the network. The above
solutions show that protons migrate from A to −A, but this migration takes several units in the chain
network, given in accordance with the width l ∼ B/A of the solution. The main characteristics of the
solution is illustrated in Fig. 2, where the soliton and the asymptotic values in the chain network is depicted.
Evidently, under the presence of an external electric ﬁeld the soliton may move, giving rise to a steady current
along the direction dictated by the external electric ﬁeld. The picture is similar to that in the original work
on solitons in hydrogen-bonded network [11].

We consider a spatial arrangement of the molecules as in Ref. [10]. As the ﬁlm is compressed, the area
per amphiphilic unit reaches a critical limit, in which the distance between two consecutive COOH groups
is around 7 ˚A; see Fig. 1. At this point, the oxygens from the OH and ﬁlm head groups are about 2.4
˚A apart. The hydrogen bonds get stronger, bridging the water to the ﬁlm head tightly, which forms the
network that allows the proton conduction. Experimental data shows that the conductivity increases with
decreasing of ﬁlm area. This aspect can be incorporated in the model if we assume the energy of the kink
decreases with area per amphiphilic molecule. We do this by requiring the parameter A to decrease with
the distance between the head groups.

FIG. 2. Schematic view of the soliton solution, showing the corresponding amplitude A and width l ∼ B/A. We
also depict the asymptotic spots in the chain network, to illustrate that the soliton is localized in a ﬁnite region,
involving several units of the hydrogen-bonded chain.

1 /µ1 − ν2

When A decreases, the parameters ν1 and ν2 that control the derivative coupling should increase, because
when the head of the amphiphilic molecule gets closer to the water molecule, the derivative coupling should
become more eﬀective. Since B is given by B = 1 − ν2
2 /µ2, for increasing ν1 and ν2, it should
consequently decrease. Although we do not know the exact way B decreases, we can compare it with A.
We can consider, for instance, the simplest possibility in which the ratio A/B remains constant. This
approximation introduces two important consequences: i) the soliton width depends on A/B, so it should
not depend on the ﬁlm compression; ii) the energy of the soliton depends on A3/B, so it should only
depend on A2. With this assumption, our model predicts that the energy of the soliton should vary at
the rate E/E0 = A2/A2
0, for some reference value A0. As the energy is reduced, the probability of soliton
creation is increased, yielding a higher proton conductivity in agreement with the experimental results. In
summary, the formalism presented here allows proton conductivity data in Langmuir ﬁlms to be explained.
Because the physical grounds have been established, one can now extend the soliton model to treat the data
quantitatively, which will be the subject of our further investigation. In addition, the framework may be
applied to proton conductance in more involved systems such as cell membranes, where proton conductance

is believed to play an important role [1]. Also it may be useful in the attempts to investigate eﬀects from
alcohols on lateral conductance [26].

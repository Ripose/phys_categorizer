Ab initio calculations including electron correlation are still extremely costly except for the smallest
atoms and molecules. Therefore, our purpose in the present study is to employ a bond-order cor-
relation approach to obtain, via equilibrium molecular energies, molecular dissociation energies and
heats of formation for some 20 molecules containing C, H, and O atoms, with a maximum number
of electrons around 40. Finally, basis set choice is shown to be important in the proposed procedure
to include electron correlation eﬀects in determining thermodynamic properties. With the optimum
choice of basis set, the average percentage error for some 20 molecules is approximately 20% for heats
of formation. For molecular dissociation energies the average error is much smaller: ∼ 0.4%.

Keywords: Molecular equilibrium energies; Molecular dissociation energies; Molecular heats of
formation.

1 Introduction

In the last few years, much eﬀort has been devoted to the development of theoretical techniques for
the calculation of fundamental thermodynamical quantities related to molecular formation. These
quantities include the molecular heat of formation, ∆H, the variation of entropy, ∆S, and the
variation of free energy, ∆G, as well as other physical quantities related to them, such as the molecular
dissociation energy D0, and the equilibrium constants of the chemical reactions.

The available theoretical techniques to extract such quantities are especially helpful whenever the
experimental results, albeit accurate, are aﬀected by uncertainties, due to the diﬃculty of obtaining
pure samples of a given compound. Therefore, eﬃcient and accurate theoretical methods are required
to compute thermodynamical quantities.

In particular, the Gx methods (x = 1, 2, 3) have been recently developed to this purpose [1].
These techniques are based on the combination of several ab initio molecular energy calculations,
using various basis sets, and including correlation eﬀects within the framework of Møller-Plesset (MP)
theory [2], at MP2 and MP4 levels of approximation. However, one of the main drawbacks of the
Gx methods is their computational complexity. Indeed, even for the energy calculation of molecules
of relatively small size, both computation time and memory occupancy are quite expensive [3]. As
a consequence, the application of this class of methods is eﬀectively limited by the system size.
Therefore, it is of considerable interest to investigate alternative theoretical techniques to calculate
useful thermodynamical quantities for the formation of molecules, which require less computational
resources, while maintaining a good level of accuracy.

In this context, Cremer et al. [5,6] have demonstrated that it is possible to extract the Schr¨odinger
energy of a molecule, ES, i.e. the energy corresponding to the exact solution of the Schr¨odinger
equation for a given molecule, from the experimental values of some observable quantities, such as
the molecular heat of formation and the molecular vibrational frequencies. Inversely, any theoretical
model able to closely reproduce the molecular Schr¨odinger energies, is also expected to yield molecular
heats of formation ∆H close to the experimental ones.

c

By deﬁnition, the diﬀerence between the molecular Schr¨odinger energy ES and the molecular
energy obtained from a calculation at Hartree-Fock (HF) level is the ‘experimental’ correlation energy,
Eexp
. For this reason, in Ref. [7] we developed a semi-empirical method to calculate a theoretical
c
(the bond-order correlation energy, or BOCE) to the correlation energy Eexp
estimate Etheo
based on
the molecular bond-order matrix. Within the framework of the Lewis model [8], which describes the
bond between atoms in a molecule as the sum of localized electron pairs, this ‘theoretical’ correlation
energy Etheo
is calculated as the sum of the correlation energies of each atom, and the contribution
due to the binding energy of each bond. The latter is in turn evaluated in terms of the product
between the molecular bond-order matrix and some empirical parameters (see also Ref. [9] for more
details). Since the BOCE method relies on a relatively simple transformation of the matrix of the
molecular orbital coeﬃcients, it turns out that it is a rather fast and accurate technique, as compared
to the Gx methods.

The BOCE technique has been applied to calculate molecular properties, such as the molecular
energy Etheo
, the ionization potentials, and the electron aﬃnities of closed and open shell molecules
containing C, H, and O atoms [7], and recently it has been extended to closed and open shell molecules
containing Si, H, F, and Cl [9]. In view of the previous satisfactory results for these molecular classes,
in this paper we apply the BOCE method to the calculation of other molecular properties such as the
molecular heat of formation and the molecular dissociation energies of several molecules containing
C, H, and O. Since the bond-order matrix depends on the basis set used in the HF calculation, we
compare the results within the G2 model with our BOCE results obtained using diﬀerent basis sets.

2 Method

The starting point of the BOCE method is the experimental correlation energy, Eexp
. This is deﬁned
as the diﬀerence between the Schr¨odinger molecular energy ES and the Hartree-Fock energy, EHF,

c

Eexp

c = ES − EHF.

(1)

In Eq. (1), EHF is the energy from an ideal Hartree-Fock calculation, requiring an inﬁnite basis set.
It should be emphasized that, in any practical calculation, EHF includes errors due to the particular

choice of basis set in the HF calculation. These errors can be made arbitrarily low, by choosing a
suﬃciently large basis set.

In analogy to Eq. (1), one can deﬁne a ‘theoretical’ correlation energy Etheo

, as the diﬀerence
between the molecular energy Etheo obtained within a theoretical model at higher level than HF
(below, the superscript ‘theo’ will alternatively refer to Gx or BOCE), and the HF molecular energy:

c

c

= Etheo − EHF.

Following the molecular dissociation scheme, reported in Ref. [9],

AB −→ A + B + binding energy,

both experimental and theoretical correlation energies can be partitioned into sums of atomic and
bond contributions,

where the sums run over all atoms and pairs of atoms in the molecule, respectively, and both exper-
imental and theoretical atomic correlation energies are deﬁned as in Eqs. (1) and (2), respectively.

As assumed in Refs. [7, 9], within the BOCE method (theo = BOCE) we identify the theoretical

energy of a single atom with its Schr¨odinger energy,

Therefore, the atomic theoretical correlation energies will be equal to the experimental ones:

On the other hand, the bond contribution within the BOCE method is described as an analytical
function of the bond order PAB between atoms A and B, as obtained within the HF calculation.
Therefore, to lowest order in PAB , one has [7, 9]

ES (A) = EBOCE(A).

The bonding parameters aAB in the second term of Eq. (8) can be obtained from the experimental

each of them contained ni times, we can rewrite the second term of Eq. (8) as

aAB PAB = n1aAB PAB + n2aAC PAC + . . . + nM aW Z PW Z ,

where it has been assumed that the bond-order of each pair is approximately the same for each pair
of the same kind in the molecule. In this sense, the parameter aAB is the binding correlation energy
per bond A − B.

The procedure starts with the calculation of the parameter aHH obtained from the experimental

Following an analogous procedure, the parameters aCC, aCO, aOO, and aOH have been obtained
starting from the experimental correlation energies of C2H6, (CH3)2O, H2O2, and H2O, respectively
(see Table 1).

In concluding this section, let us brieﬂy recall the deﬁnition of the thermodynamical quantities
which will be calculated in the next section, viz. the molecular dissociation energy and the molecular
heat of formation.

2.1 Deﬁnition of some relevant thermodynamic quantities

The experimental molecular dissociation energy is deﬁned as

Dexp

0 =

ES(A) − ES + EZP E,

(12)

where ES(A) is the Schr¨odinger energy of atom A in the molecule, ES is the total Schr¨odinger energy
of the molecule, and EZP E is the vibrational Zero Point Energy, which is calculated from the values
of the molecular vibrational frequencies. In view of Eq. (5), within the BOCE approximation one
has for the molecular dissociation energy:

DBOCE

0

=

ES(A) − EBOCE + EZP E .

(13)

Therefore, the diﬀerence between the experimental and calculated dissociation energies can be ex-
pressed as

In other words, only the diﬀerence between bonding BOCE and experimental energies contributes

Finally, following Cremer et al. [5, 6], the experimental molecular heat of formation is related to

ES by

∆H exp = (H298 K − H0 K) −

ES (A) − ES + EZP E

!

A

= (H298 K − H0 K) − Dexp

and therefore the BOCE molecular heat of formation is related to EBOCE by

∆H BOCE = (H298 K − H0 K) −

ES(A) − EBOCE + EZP E

 

A
X

!

= (H298 K − H0 K) − DBOCE

.

In the above equations, H298 K − H0 K is the variation of molecular enthalpy from 298 K to 0 K,
and can be evaluated according to standard thermodynamical formulas [10]. Therefore, subtracting
Eqs. (15) and (16), one obtains

∆H exp − ∆H BOCE = DBOCE

0

− Dexp
0

.

We recall that the above derivation holds in the BOCE approximation, where ES = EBOCE, for
atoms. In general, for other methods, such as the G2 method, one has ES 6= EG2, and Eqs. (13) and
(14) become:

DG2

0 =

EG2(A) − EG2 + EZP E,

and

Dexp

0 − DG2

0 =

[ES(A) − EG2(A)] + (ES − EG2),

respectively, whereas Eq. (17) holds also for the G2 method, i.e.

The procedures involved in all Gx calculations (x = 1, 2, 3) are quite similar, and have been described
in the original works by Curtiss et al. [1]. With respect to the calculation of the molecular heats of
formation, the results of the Gx methods show that, in some classes of compounds, the G3 method
is more accurate, while for other classes of compounds the G2 or the G1 methods seem to be more
accurate than the G3. We have chosen to compare the molecular heats of formation calculated within
the BOCE approximation with those obtained with the G2 method.

In all calculations involving the BOCE method, we have used the basis sets 3-21G, 6-311G,
6-31G∗∗, 6-311G∗∗, and 6-311G++∗∗, and in the calculation of the bond-order matrix we have
employed L¨owdin’s deﬁnition [11] for all the latter basis sets. Our results for the bond parameters aAB
for the diﬀerent chosen basis sets are reported in Tab. 1, while our results for the bonding correlation
energies, EBOCE(AB) are reported in Tab. 2, for all pairs AB between H, C, and O. It may be
seen that the variations in the bond parameters from one basis set to another are closely correlated

with those in the bonding correlation energies for the same bond and between the same basis sets.
This is in agreement with the procedure outlined in the previous section [see e.g. Eq. (11)], in view
of the minor dependence of aAB on the bond-order matrix element PAB than on the experimental
molecular correlation energy Eexp

3.1 Molecular energies

Tab. 3 lists the set of 23 molecules, containing C, O, and H, considered in this work. For these
molecules, Tab. 4 reports the experimental values of the Schr¨odinger energies, the total molecular
energy (including correlation) within the G2 model, EG2, and the total molecular energy (again,
including correlation) within the BOCE approximation, EBOCE = EBOCE
+EHF. The latter depends
on the particular basis set chosen for the HF calculation, as described above.

It may be seen that the diﬀerence |EG2 − ES| ranges between ≈ 140 and 535 mhartree, whereas
|EBOCE − ES| is always below ≈ 25 mhartree, for all the basis sets considered. Our ﬁrst conclusion
is therefore that, with respect to the Schr¨odinger result, the BOCE approximation is more accurate
than the G2 method for the 23 molecules in our data set. While it is tempting to assume that
this conclusion will remain true for the entire G2 data set, this is not decisive based solely on our
present study. In particular, from Tab. 4, the best BOCE results correspond to the 6-311G basis
set. This is due to a competition of various eﬀects. First of all, the HF contribution to the total
energy EBOCE = EBOCE
+ EHF clearly decreases on increasing the size of the basis set, owing
to the variational nature of the HF calculation. Therefore, one invariably ﬁnds that EHF decreases
along the series 3-21G → 6-311G++∗∗. On the other hand, following Eq. (4b), and decomposing
the correlation energy EBOCE
into atomic and binding contributions, one ﬁnds that the atomic
(respectively, binding) contributions for the various basis sets are minimum (respectively, maximum)
for the 6-311G basis set. This is probably due to the nature of the 6-311G basis set (and of the 6-3xx
basis set family, in general), usually employed to optimize the energies of the single atoms.

c

c

As a result of the compensation of these various contributions, the use of the 6-311G basis set
within the BOCE method yields the best agreement with the Schr¨odinger energy. This is especially
important, in view of the dependence of the dissociation energies D0 on ES .

In concluding this subsection on the molecular energies, let us discuss the dependence of the bond
order for a given bond on the basis set employed. The average values of the bond order PAB for
the bonds C–H, C–C, O–H, C–O appearing in the molecules listed in Tab. 3 have been reported
in Tab. 5 for the various basis sets. (The bond O–O has not been included, since there is only one
molecule in Tab. 3 involving such bond.) One can see that, in bonds involving H and C atoms, the
bond order variation along the series of basis sets considered here is below 4%, whereas in bonds
involving the oxygen atom, the bond order variation ranges from ≈ 18% (C–O) to ≈ 27% (O–H).
This is in agreement with the study of Sannigrahi [12], where a more pronounced dependence of the
bond-order and of the valency on the basis set is found for all compounds containing electronegative
centers (such as O, F, Cl). For calculations concerning these compounds, Sannigrahi [12] therefore
recommends the use of double-zeta basis sets, and of polarization and diﬀuse functions in the case
of highly ionic and/or negatively charged species.

3.2 Dissociation energy and molecular heat of formation

In Tab. 6 we report the experimental and theoretical molecular dissociation energies D0 for the set
of molecules listed in Tab. 3. In particular, Tab. 6 compares the theoretical values obtained within
the G2 method (second column) and the BOCE approximation, for the ﬁve basis sets considered
above. Analogously, Tab. 7 reports the experimental and theoretical molecular heats of formation
∆H for the same molecules, models, and basis sets.

In the case of the theoretical dissociation energy calculated within the G2 method, DG2

0 , we ﬁnd
an average percentage diﬀerence with respect to the experimental value of ≈ 0.2 % (corresponding to
≈ 1.5 kcal). For the same quantity calculated within the BOCE approximation, we ﬁnd an average
percentage diﬀerence with respect to the experimental value of ≈ 0.4 − 0.8 % (corresponding to
≈ 2.4 − 5.9 kcal), depending on the basis set employed (Tab. 6). Analogously, for the molecular
heats of formation (Tab. 7), on the average we ﬁnd |∆H G2 − ∆H exp| ≈ 8.2 % (corresponding to
≈ 1.5 kcal), and |∆H BOCE − ∆H exp| ≈ 21.4 − 58.5 % (corresponding to ≈ 2.4 − 5.9 kcal). (Such
larger values of the average percentage errors are justiﬁed by the smaller values of the experimental

July 26, 2013

7

molecular heats of formation, than the experimental molecular dissociation energies.) In both cases,
the best agreement within the BOCE approximation is obtained for the 6-311G basis set, as it was
the case for the molecular energies.

Therefore, we may conclude that, while the G2 method yields in general more accurate estimates
of the molecular dissociation energies and the heats of formation, the BOCE approximation aﬀords
theoretical estimates of the above quantities of comparable accuracy, but now requiring much less
computational eﬀort. Within the BOCE approximation, moreover, the best agreement with the ex-
perimental results is obtained for the 6-311G basis set. As observed for the molecular energies, this
is a result of the competition of the various atomic and binding contributions to the correlation ener-
gies (and therefore to the other thermodynamical quantities considered in this work). In particular,
within the BOCE approximation, the binding contribution to the total correlation energy is relatively
larger than the atomic contribution, and it can be therefore directly related to the bond-order value.
While it is agreed that the use of modest basis sets reduce the computing time required to obtain
chemical accuracy relative to the Gx methods, it is appropriate, at this point, to expand on our
reasoning as to why the 6-311G basis set gives better results than the somewhat larger basis sets
we have also worked with. For such, still quite restricted, basis sets, there is rather non-uniform
‘convergence’. We oﬀer, as an explanation of such non-uniformity, that the better results obtained
with the 6-311G basis set rest on a somewhat delicate interplay between diﬀuse s-like (+) and
polarization d-like (∗) functions on the one hand, and functions corresponding to valence electrons
on the other. As a consequence, in the larger basis sets considered here, the total bond-order of each
atom is overestimated with respect to the 6-311G basis set. The latter point about bond-order can be
illustrated with reference to Table 5. If we neglect the 3-21G basis set recorded there, then with just
two exceptions (the C–C bond with the 6-311G∗∗ basis set and the C–H bond with the 6-311G++∗∗
basis set), the bond orders are smallest for the 6-311G set. Speciﬁcally then, the advantage among
these small basis sets lies with the 6-311G basis set in that its diﬀuse and polarization functions
increase, in the ﬁnal bond-order matrix, the total number of electrons in each atom contributing to
the bond.

A ﬁner analysis of the various terms contributing to the molecular dissociation energies and heats
of formation reveals that the very good agreement of the G2 method with the experimental results is
due to a partial compensation of the two competing contributions for Dexp
0 and ∆H exp−∆H G2
in the right hand sides of Eqs. (19) and (20), respectively. Indeed, one ﬁnds EG2 − ES ≈ 74.356 −
A[EG2(A) − ES(A)] ≈ 74.169 − 222.507 kcal, for the various molecules of
229.413 kcal, while
Tab. 3, with diﬀerences between the two quantities ranging between −3.0 kcal and 6.9 kcal (Fig. 1).
Therefore, in some way, within the G2 method the errors on the molecular part are compensated by
the atomic part, i.e. the binding energy is very close to the Schr¨odinger value.

0 −DG2

P

On the contrary, within the BOCE method [cf. Eqs. (14) and (17)], the diﬀerence between exper-
imental and calculated molecular dissociation energies and heats of formation depends only on the
diﬀerence between the Schr¨odinger and the BOCE molecular energy, given the assumption that the
BOCE atomic energies are equal to the Schr¨odinger counterparts, Eq. (5). Therefore, even though
the BOCE molecular energy is very close to the Schr¨odinger value, such a small diﬀerence (in kcal)
cannot be compensated by the atomic contribution.

4 Conclusions and directions for future work

We have compared and contrasted the Gx method (especially with x = 2) and the BOCE approxi-
mation for estimating (a) molecular energies, (b) molecular dissociation energies, and (c) molecular
heats of formation for some 20 molecules containing C, H, and O atoms. Although the G2 method
usually yields better agreement with the experimental results, we ﬁnd that the accuracy of the the-
oretical estimates of the above observable quantities within the BOCE approximation is comparable
to that of the G2 calculations, but now with a remarkable saving in terms of computational com-
plexity. With respect to previous studies [7, 9], all BOCE parameters have been calculated on single
model molecules, rather than averaging over several molecules. Therefore, each BOCE parameter
aAB reﬂects the nature of the particular bond A − B, irrespective of its chemical surroundings. In
other words, we ﬁnd that the BOCE method is rather robust with respect to the inclusion of further
than binary correlation terms. Moreover, we have extensively analyzed the dependence of the BOCE
results on the basis set chosen for the underlying HF calculation.

Owing to the much reduced computational eﬀort required in a BOCE calculation, we plan to
apply the latter method to the evaluation of molecular properties of larger molecules, where Gx

methods are expected to require presently prohibitive resources. It is also intended, in the light of
the excellent results for molecular dissociation energies, to study for such a set of larger molecules
the relation between the ﬁndings of the BOCE approximation and Teller’s theorem [13], which states
that molecules do not bind in a fully local density approximation (LDA), i.e. including kinetic energy
density in LDA. Mucci and March [14] proposed to make a merit out of Teller’s theorem, by relating
dissociation energy to molecular electron density gradients [15, 16]. However, electron correlation in
the separated atoms seems important also in respect to heats of formation [see Eqs. (19) and (20)
above], and this will also require further exploration.

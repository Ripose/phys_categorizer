Solutions of trans−polyisoprene in cyclohexane are investigated in atomistic detail at diﬀerent compositions
at two diﬀerent temperatures. We investigate the inﬂuence of polymer concentration on the dynamics of the
solvent molecules and the structure of the solvation shell. The double bonds along the polymer backbone are
preferentially approached by the solvent molecules. The mobility of cyclohexane molecules decreases with in-
creasing polymer concentration at ambient conditions. The reorientation of molecules becomes more anisotropic
with concentration as the polymer hinders the reorientation of the molecular plane. At elevated temperatures
the inﬂuence of the polymer is weaker and the reorientation of the solvent is more isotropic. Additionally, a
fast and eﬃcient way to set up atomistic simulations is shown in detail in which the initial simulations increase
in length and in the simulation time-step. The excess energy from initial overlaps is removed by resetting the
velocities at regular intervals.

Introduction

Polymeric solutions are important for the understanding of technologically important applications of polymers.
Therefore they have been in the focus of molecular simulations over the recent decade. Many studies have been
performed to investigate generic characteristics of polymer solutions by means of simple bead-spring models [1,2].
However, to investigate the behavior of a system on the local scale, fully atomistic simulations will be required.
Several authors have dealt with atomistically detailed descriptions of polymer solutions [3–6]. But, there are
only few studies how the polymer inﬂuences the solvent dynamics [7, 8]. Especially, the region of low weight
fraction of polymer has not yet been studied. This contribution focuses on the liquid structure and dynamics of
small solvent molecules in the neighborhood of oligomer chains in dilute solution. We use as an example trans-
polyisoprene dissolved in cyclohexane. Cyclohexane is a rather spherical organic molecule and experimentally
known to be a good solvent for polyisoprene [9, 10]. Polyisoprene by itself is one of the most commonly used
polymers. Its natural form, cautschuk, is highly abundant in nature and for technological purposes, synthetic
variations are easily industrially polymerised from isoprene. Still, the solutions of such important materials are
not yet completely understood from a microscopic viewpoint.

2 Details of the System

Systems containing one or two 15-mers (C75H122) of trans-polyisoprene (PI) are simulated in a solution consisting
of 250 or 500 molecules of cyclohexane (C6H12). An overview over all the systems is given in Table 1, also the
resulting densities in the simulations are shown in that ﬁgure. Details of the self-developed forceﬁelds are found
in ref. [11] for trans-polyisoprene and refs. [12, 13] for cyclohexane. The polyisoprene forceﬁeld is in contrast
to the original version enhanced with torsions for the methyl groups with a strength of 3.3 kJ/mol per atom
(9.9 kJ/mol per methyl group). The cyclohexane forceﬁeld is augmented with torsion potentials for all the C−C
bonds. Each of them has a strength of 10 kJ/mol in order to prevent random ﬂipping between conﬁgurations.
The cyclohexane molecule can occur in the so-called chair or boat conﬁguration. They are distinguished if the
connection between C1 and C4 intersects the plane deﬁned by the other carbons (chair) or not (boat). All

simulations and analyses are performed using the YASP molecular dynamics package [14]. No charges are used
throughout the simulations.
Both forceﬁelds have been proven useful in recent simulations. The polyisoprene forceﬁeld was used to investigate
the dynamics of oligomer melts [11] whereas the cyclohexane model was used in simulations of pure cyclohexane
and its mixtures with cyclohexene at ambient conditions [13].

3 How to set up and equilibrate an atomistic simulation

In atomistic simulations, the way a system is initially set up and equilibrated is crucial. Thus, we describe the
equilibration procedure for our systems in detail. For system 1 (one polymer chain solvated by 250 cyclohexanes)
the 250 cyclohexane molecules were put onto a regular fcc lattice in a cubic box of 4 nm side-length corresponding
to a density of ρ = 545.8kg/m3. An N V E simulation with a very short timestep of 10−3 fs was started. The
timestep was increased from 10−3 fs to 1 fs in three steps; in each step it was multiplied by a factor of 10. Each
simulation was run for 1000 steps at constant volume and energy. The velocities of the particles were reset
from a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution corresponding to 300 K before each run. The polyisoprene molecule
was inserted at random, and the pre-equilibration procedure restarted. This time the initial timestep was set
to 10−6 fs and the steps were increased by factors of 100, only the last two increases were by factors of 10.
The initial polyisoprene conformation was taken from the C75 chains of the melt system 3 of ref. [11]. In the
rare case that one of the short simulations failed because of a non-convergence of the SHAKE algorithm [15] an
additional reset of the velocities was applied.
This method of pre-equilibration is very fast for a fully atomistic system. It avoids the use of unphysical soft-
core simulations. By resetting the velocities to the desired temperature periodically, the system moves very
eﬃciently away from its initial high energy. One can randomly insert the solute if the density is low and the
timestep suﬃciently short. The very short simulations at short timesteps have the additional advantage that
not too much energy is transferred to internal degrees of freedom which would lead to longer simulations in
later equilibration stages.
After the simulation was running stable under N V E conditions at a timestep of 1 fs, the Weak-Coupling
themostat [16] was switched on. 10 ps later the isotropic Weak-Coupling constant pressure routine was switched
on to compress the system to the correct density. The compressibility was set to the experimental value of
1.12 GPa−1 of pure cyclohexane [17]. Coupling times for pressure and temperature were τT = 0.2 ps and
τp = 2.0 ps respectively. The ﬁrst constant pressure run, however, started with ∆t = 0.1 fs and τp = 200 ps. A
stepwise increase of the timestep and decrease of the coupling times was performed until the simulations under
production conditions were possible (τT = 0.2 ps, τp = 2.0 ps, ∆t = 2fs).
A second system was produced the same way but independently with another 15-mer from the melt simulations.
These two systems were merged to form the systems with two polymers. The system with only 250 cyclohexane
molecules and 2 polymers was produced by taking out every second cyclohexane and letting the system relax
to the correct density in an N pT simulation.
After proper relaxation at the correct timestep using temperature and pressure coupling, the production runs
were started. The relaxation lasted longer than the correlation time for the end-to-end length of the polymer
to lose the memory of the melt structure. The production runs lasted up to 5 ns. The reorientation correlation
time of the chains was around 2 ns. Conﬁgurations were saved every 1000 steps (i.e. 2 ps). The simulations
were performed at ambient conditions (T = 300K, p = 101.3kPa) and at T = 413K, p = 101.3kPa. The higher
temperature was chosen for consistency with simulations of solutions of polyisoprene in toluene [3] although
cyclohexane and toluene are gases at that temperature in nature. This vaporization transition is not reproduced
by the force-ﬁeld. The cutoﬀ for the Lennard-Jones interaction was set to 0.9nm and for the neighbor list [18]
to 1.0nm. The neighbor-list was updated every 10 timesteps and the total momentum of the box was reset to

added torsions in the forceﬁeld in comparison to ref. [13].

4 Statics and Dynamics of Cyclohexane solvating Polyisoprene

In this section the carbons along the polymer chain are referred to in the following way: C1 is the non-methyl
end of the monomer. C2 and C3 are connected by the double bond. C2 is connected to C1, C4 is the methyl
carbon, and C5 is between C3 and C1 (cf. Fig. 1).
The ﬁrst question we want to address is the way the cyclohexane molecules solvate polyisoprene. Therefore we
investigate the number of cyclohexane carbons close to the ﬁve distinct carbons along the chain. We do not
distinguish between diﬀerent concentrations here. To avoid end eﬀects, the end monomers are excluded from
the calculation. The resulting radial distribution functions are shown in Figure 2.
The main diﬀerence between the two temperatures is that for T = 300 K the neighbor peak is a double peak
for some of the carbons. The two sub-peaks are about 0.07 nm apart. This structure does not persist at the
elevated temperature. The overall height of the peaks is, however, unchanged. This indicates that the number
of cyclohexanes solvating a monomer is not temperature dependent. The arrangement of the solvent molecules,
however, is. C4 which is the side group, can come into closest contact with the solvent visible at the shoulder at

Table 2: Motion of cyclohexane in the presence of polyisoprene. The error of the diﬀusion coeﬃcients was
estimated by the anisotropy of the mean-squared displacements. The errors of the reorientation times were
estimated by the scatter of the times of the diﬀerent vectors. The upper half of the table corresponds to
T=300 K, the lower half to T=413 K. The x − y notation means that the system contains x polymer chains and
y solvent molecules. The diﬀerences between the 1 − 250 and the 2 − 500 system can be used as an estimate of
the simulation error or ﬁnite size eﬀects as both these systems are at the same concentration. These eﬀects are
on the order of less than 5%.

r ≈ 0.4 nm. It was also seen in the melt investigations that this carbon is most exposed [11]. All carbons exhibit
a peak at the ﬁrst solvation shell at r ≈ 0.55 − 0.6 nm. A second (r ≈ 1.1 nm) and third (r ≈ 1.55 nm) solvation
shell are visible. The ﬁrst peak is strongest for the two double bonded carbons. They are not very strongly
shielded by hydrogens and are therefore rather easily accessible. This is in contrast to the melt simulations
where the lacking mobility of these carbons prevented a close approach to neighboring chains [11]. As the
mobility of the solvent is much higher than that of the polymer, the diﬀerences in mobility of the polymer
atoms is not important. At the higher temperature, the second and third solvation shell are slightly shifted to
larger distances. The third solvation shell is rather broad.
The cyclohexane diﬀusion is found to be completely isotropic and the molecules have diﬀused several times
their gyration radius. The diﬀusion coeﬃcient is measured by ﬁtting the mean-squared displacement of the
center-of-mass of the cyclohexane molecules to h~r 2i = 6Dt. The results are found in Table 2. The diﬀusion
coeﬃcient for pure cyclohexane in this model is found to be 0.78 × 10−5 cm2/s at T = 300K. The value of
0.89 × 10−5 cm2/s reported in reference [13] is about 15% higher. This is probably due to the missing internal
torsions in that work which make it easier for the molecule to squeeze through small voids. The diﬀusivity of
cyclohexane decreases with increasing polymer concentration. The polymer molecules can be viewed as obstacles
for the solvent. This decrease is opposite to the pronounced increase of cyclohexane mobility in the presence of
the smaller cyclohexene [13]. We can thus conclude that the mobility of cyclohexane depends strongly on the
size and concentration of the molecules with which it is mixed.
Pure cyclohexane reorients faster in the plane deﬁned by the carbon ring than the plane ﬂips. To investigate
the reorientation behavior in the presence of the polymer, we measure the two principal reorientation times of
an oblate molecule, i.e. τk measures the reorientation of vectors connecting carbons across the ring, whereas
τ⊥ is the characteristic time for rotating the axis normal to the plane. This axis is deﬁned in the simulations
as cross-product of two C−C vectors across the ring. The former measures the reorientation of the molecule
in its plane, whereas the latter measures the reorientation of the plane.
In an earlier study, we found that
pure cyclohexane, as well as cyclohexane in a mixture with cyclohexene, reorients faster in-plane than the plane
reorients [13]. This is expected for a dense liquid; in the gas-phase, one expects this order to be reversed due
to the moments of inertia. The reorientation times presented in Table 2 were derived by an exponential ﬁt to
the ﬁrst 25 ps of the correlation function at T = 300K (10 ps for T = 413 K). These ﬁts reproduced the curves
very accurately. The reorientation times are measured as correlation times of the ﬁrst Legendre polynomial
P1(t) = h~u(t)~u(0)i. The resolution and accuracy is better than for P2(t) as the corresponding times are longer.
~u(t) is the unit vector we are monitoring. We ﬁnd signs for Debye rotation T1 = 3T2, however, as T2 is very
short this cannot be completely decided. The cyclohexane model used in this work is slightly more anisotropic
than its predecessor without internal torsions. The in-plane reorientation is exactly the same as in the old
model [13]. The reorientation of the plane is about 10% slower as in the model lacking internal torsions.
The in-plane reorientation time is practically unaﬀected by the concentration of the polymer except for pure
cyclohexane, whereas the reorientation of the plane becomes slower with increasing concentration. As the in-
plane reorientation does not need any other molecule to make room for the transition to occur, the opposite is

the case for the plane-ﬂip. Therefore the polymers act as obstacles to the molecules in their neighborhood and
make their dynamics more anisotropic as concentration increases. Pure cyclohexane appears to be a diﬀerent
case as it is rather strongly anisotropic; this manifests itself in a clearly faster in-plane reorientation than all
the other cases. This suggests that the in-plane reorientation of the molecules close to the polymer is hindered
by the chain. This eﬀect is similar in strength for all concentrations.
At the elevated temperature, the reorientation times are clearly shorter. The anisotropy at this temperature
becomes weaker, and in the range of concentrations here, it does not depend systematically on polymer content.
Assuming an Arrhenius behavior, we can estimate activation energies for the diﬀerent rotations and the diﬀusion;
they are shown in Figure 3. Note that the activation energies for the diﬀusion are divided by a factor of two.
These activation energies are on the order of Eact = 10 kJ/mol for the rotations and on the order of 20 KJ/mol
for the diﬀusion and are only weakly dependent on concentration. We see that the in-plane reorientation is
stronger temperature dependent than the plane ﬂip. At very high temperatures an inversion of the reorientation
order may therefore be expected in line with the moments of inertia. This explains the seemingly contradictory
ﬁnding that the plane-ﬂip is found to be slower in the simulated range but has the smaller activation energy.
This is due to the stronger temperature dependence of the in-plane reorientation.
The increasing anisotropy of reorientation with concentration has been reported for two other systems at
higher concentrations. It has been found for water as solvent of polyvinylacohol [8] and benzene as solvent
of polystyrene [7].
The diﬀusion is much stronger temperature dependent than both the rotations. This can be understood by the
fact that for a molecule to diﬀuse the neighborhood has to give way in a much stronger fashion, i.e. the whole
neighborhood has to rearrange whereas for rotation the particle can in principle stay in place.

5 Conclusion

Altogether, we showed that the increasing polymer concentration has a decelerating eﬀect on the dynamics of
the cyclohexane solvent molecules. The polymer chains are obstacles to the cyclohexane motion and make their
reorientation more anisotropic. Additionally we see, in comparison with the model lacking internal torsions,
that even for molecules as small and rigid as cyclohexane internal torsion potentials have an eﬀect on the overall
dynamics.
The simulations presented here were additionally used as starting points for coarse-graining simulations with

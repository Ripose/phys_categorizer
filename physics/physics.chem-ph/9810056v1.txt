Abstract

By means of density, dielectric spectroscopy and sound velocity measurements we
perform a systematic study on the polyoxyethylene C12E6 nonionic surfactant so-
lutions as a function of temperature and concentration. Both density and sound
velocity data, at about 34◦C, coincide with the value obtained for pure water.
Above this temperature the density is lower than the water density whereas below
it is greater, the opposite happens for the compressibility. Combining results from
these diﬀerent techniques we tempt a very detailed description of the evolution of
the micellar interfacial properties with temperature. It is well known that nonionic
surfactant solutions dehydrate, growing temperature. Our results indicate that this
process is associated with a continuous change in the polymer conformation and in
the local density of the micellar interface.

1 Introduction

The thermodynamic properties of the polyoxyethylene nonionic amphiphile
(CiEj : CiH2i+1 − [O − CH2 − CH2]jOH) water mixtures are characterised by
a very delicate balance between competitive forces; small temperature varia-
tions can change the overall equilibrium condition of the solution [1]. These
mixtures present a temperature dependence of the aggregate dimension [2], a
lower consolutum temperature and a very ﬂat coexisting region, various liquid
crystal phases [3] . These properties often resemble each other for the diﬀerent
i, j monomeric species using speciﬁc rescaling parameters ([2], [4]). Changes

in the hydration state of the micellar aggregates are considered the driving
mechanism for micellar growth [4] and phase separation, both in these surfac-
tant solutions [6] as well as in pure EOj(O − CH2 − CH2)j-water mixtures
[7]. Clearly the volume per monomer is directly related to the degree of hy-
dration, i.e. diﬀerent monomeric volumes stabilise diﬀerent micellar shape and
size distribution function. Since the oil core cannot easily change its density
and it is hydrophobic, the variations of the degree of hydration and then of the
monomeric volume are mainly due to the properties of the EO-water mixtures
at the micellar interface. This point of view naturally divides the solution into
three subregions: the oil core, with overall properties similar to an oil bulk
phase, the interfacial EO-water mixture and the bulk water phase. The three
regions are weighted by the relative volume fraction.

Experimental techniques which can contrast the three diﬀerent regions of the
amphiphilic solutions are useful to determine the thermodynamic properties
of the interface as a function of temperature and surfactant concentration. To
this end we utilised density measurements (oil bulk phase ∼ 0.75g/cm3; water
bulk phase ∼ 0.99g/cm3; EO-water mixture ranging from 0.998g/cm3 and
1.10g/cm3 at 25◦C); sound velocity (oil bulk phase ∼ 1297m/s ; water bulk
phase ∼ 1450m/s; EO-water mixture ranging from 1500m/s and 1600m/s at
25◦C) and dielectric constant data (oil bulk phase ∼ 2; water bulk phase ∼ 80;
EO-water mixture ranging from 30 and 60 at 25◦C). All these techniques are
linear in the volume fraction of the relative three components, but related
to diﬀerent properties of EO-water phase. The density depends on the mass
concentration at the interface; the dielectric costant on the local polarizability,
related to the molecular connectivity of the EO-water solution; the sound
velocity is related to the elastic properties of the interfacial mixture.

2 Material and Methods

The sample analyzed (C12E6) was purchased from Nikko Chemicals and was
diluted without further puriﬁcation. The concentration of the diﬀerent wa-
ter solutions were stated by weighing. Density measurements were performed
with PAAR Digital Density Meter DMA60 in combination with remote cell
DMA 602, that can provide an accuracy up to ±1.5 · 10−6g/cm3, according
to the oscillating sample tube method. The external cell was thermostated by
Heto DBT 6 Thermostat and Heto CB8-30e Cooling Bath that guarantees a
temperature stability within 0.05◦C. A variable path-length cell was used for
the ultrasonic measurements. The cell content is about 30ml of solution. Two
matched 5 MHz fundamental crystals were used, along with a quartz delay
line, in a pulsed-sound mode. The temperature of the sample was controlled
by a water thermostat regulated within ±0.1K. The sound velocity (c) was
obtained by acoustically overlapping pulses under variable-path conditions to

The measurements were performed, at 5 and 45 MHz, the accuracy of the

over the whole frequency range.

3 Data Analysis

Some interesting indications are obtained from the density of the pure liquid
surfactant. The results for C12E5, C12E6, C12E7 and C12E8 are reported in
ﬁgure 1, for comparison the pure PEO, the water and the bulk dodecane
densities are reported too. The observed experimental values for the diﬀerent
C12Ej are between the oil and the PEO density, C12E8 is closer to the PEO
density whereas C12E5 has a lower density, closer to the data of the oil phase.
The lines trough the data represent best ﬁt obtained combining the density
of the bulk phases, namely dodecane and EO polymers [9], weighted with the
relative volume fraction:

and compare with the one of dodecane, EO polymer and water.

The ﬁtting parameters, namely the density of the EO phase and the one of the
oil core, practically coincide with the experimental one observed in the two
bulk phases. Besides, if at the density of C12E5 we add ideally the contribution
of n EO unit, i.e. in eq. 1 we change only the volume fraction since we add
to the total volume and to the head group volume the contribution of n EO
units, the experimental density of the C12E5+n is obtained.

Similar analysis can be applied on the adiabatic compressibility deﬁned as
[10]:

where ρ is the density, c the sound velocity, P the pressure and V the volume.
In Fig. 2 are presented the results from pure C12E6 with the one of the EO
polymer and of the dodecane. In this case too the compressibility of the pure
surfactant can be written as a linear combination of the one of the polymeric
phase and one of the oil phase; computing the derivative of eq. 1 the adiabatic
compressibility of the pure surfactant results:

where the undersigned volume are the molar volume of the pure surfactant,
of the oil phase and of the EO phase respectively. The ﬁtting parameters give
values with few percent variation from the one of the relative bulk phases of
the EO polymer and dodecane (βh and βt). These results indicate that even at
100% surfactant concentration still two segregate phases are present: the oil
and the polymer. The oil phase is hydrophobic then it will not change compo-
sition by adding water. The EO-water interfacial region match the interaction
of the oil phase with the bulk water, minimizing the osmotic contribution.
Then in the analysis of the experimental results on the C12E6-water solutions,
we consider the oil phases equivalent to a bulk dodecane phase at the same
temperature. For what concerns the water phase we can use the bulk water
properties at the same temperature if the C12E6-water solutions are diluted.
Under this basis we attribute the variation of the properties of the solution
to variation of the EO-water phase, for examples EO conformation, degree of
hydration etc.

In Fig. 3 a schematic view of a cross section of a spherical or cylindrical micelle
is reported. In our model of nonionic micellar solutions the oil core volume (A)
is obtained from the bulk oil phase density. The partial molar volume of the

5

bulk water (C) is known. On the other hand the interfacial volume of the head
group termination (B) can greatly vary. Depending on the polymer conforma-
tion, the polymer molarity in the B region change and diﬀerent ammount of
water are needed to ﬁll it up to the right density. All our experimental quanti-
ties depend linearly on the hydrated volume per monomer Vh of the polymeric
terminations at the micellar interface. No univocal indication can be obtained
about this volume from other experiments. Then in our analysis we extract
from the experimental results of C12E6-water solutions the interfacial density,
adiabatic compressibility and dielectric constant as a function of the param-
eter Vh and of the temperature. In particular for what concerns density we
obtain the interfacial values starting from an equation for the solution density
given by:

where ρw, φw and ρs, φs indicate the density and the volume fraction rispec-
tively of the water and the surfactants. ρs represents the density of the micelle
and, if we deﬁne ρh, φh and ρt, φt the density and the volume fraction respec-
tively of the interface and the oil core, we can write

ρ = φwρw + φsρs .

ρs = φtρt + φhρh .

Deﬁning Mw, Vw and Ms, Vs the mass and the volume of respectively a water
and a surfactant molecule, Ns the number of surfactant molecules and N h
w the
number of water molecule per polar head in the interface, then by deﬁnition
we have:

ρw =

Mw
Vw

Ms + N h

ρs =

φw =

φs =

Using these equations ρh is given by:

ρh = ρ +

Vt(ρ − ρt) +

To eliminate the dependence from the unknown N h
dition for the interfacial density:

(P M)h
(P M)w (cid:19)

Vw(ρ − ρw)

(10)

(cid:21))

The last equation represents the density ρh of the micellar interface parametrized
on its volume Vh.

For the adiabatic compressibility the previous model gives an equation

βV = βwV w[1 − xs(1 + N h

w)] + xs[βtV t + βhV h]

(11)

where xs is the mole fraction of the surfactant in solution, βi are the adiabatic
compressibilities and the V i the relative molar volumes of the three compo-
nents in the solution. N w
h , as before, represents the number of hydrated water
molecules.

The iterative use of of mixtures equation for dielectric costant, ﬁrst on the
surfactant-water solutions, then on the micella treated as a two component
solution (the oil phase and the EO-water phase), gives an expression for the
interfacial dielectric constant that parametrically depend on the volume Vh of
the head region (see [11] for details).

4 Experimental results

The density measurements are reported in Fig. 4 as a function of temperature
for diﬀerent concentrations, from 2 to 28 weight% (w%). For comparison the
water density and the pure surfactant density are reported too as a continuous
lines. At low temperature the solution densities are higher than the water den-
sity whereas at high temperature are lower for all the measured concentrations.
The crossing temperature is at about 34◦C. Similar results are observed with
the adiabatic compressibility (see Fig. 5), there exist a crossing temperature,
again at about 34◦C, where the solution compressibility collapse at the same
values for all the investigated concentrations (from 2 to 50 w%). It is interest-
ing to notice that there are no ideal combination of pure surfactant and pure
water density or compressibility which can give the experimental C12E6-water
values. It means that the interfacial region, composed by EO terminations and
water molecules, strongly modulate the overall solution density and compress-
ibility. The excess density and excess compressibility, with respect to an ideal
solution of surfactant and water, are reported in Fig. 7 and Fig. 6 respectively.
The density results concern dilute surfactant solution (2 w%), in this case two

Fig. 8. Comparison of the interfacial density at 5 and 50◦C, obtained as a func-
tion of the interfacial volume, is compared with the experimental dependence on
concentration of EO-water solutions at diﬀerent temperatures.
diﬀerent regimes can be observed above and below about 20◦C. At this tem-
perature is generally indicated the presence of the sphere to rod transition in
C12E6-water solutions [12], from a theoretical point of view the area per polar
head corrispondently strongly reduces [4]. Again this evidence supports the
role of the interface in this shape transition. For compressibility the available
concentrations are too high to present any sphere to rod transition [13].

5 Discussion and Conclusions

From density and compressibility it appears that the liquid phase of pure
C12E6 is characterized by two separated region: the oil and the EO phases; in
this case the EO region exactly resemble the pure EO polymer liquid phase.
Our results of density and compressibility at the micellar interface are param-
eterized with the interfacial volume, it means that we have a set of diﬀerent
value for the interfacial properties which depend on the local EO molarity. In
a similar manner as in the pure surfactant case, we can compare the density
dependence on the EO molarity at the micellar interface with the density of
EO- water solutions as a function of the EO molar concentrations. The results
are reported in Fig. 8. It is evident that there could exist many solutions for
the interface compatible with diﬀerent conditions of the reference mixture, a
priori all of them could be accepted. A similar procedure could not be per-
formed in the case of compressibility since the quantities N h
w, i.e. the number
of the hydrated water molecules per monomer, is not easily eliminated in eq.

11 as for density (see eq. 8 and 10). An independent determination of the vol-
ume Vh has been obtained comparing the interfacial dielectric constant with
the one of EO-water solutions. Since the dielectric constant is related to the
local polarizability, which mainly depends on the degree of connectivity of the
hydrogen bond network, then the Vh obtained with this technique represent
reliable value. Accordingly we used such Vh values in order to ﬁx from the
density the number of hydrated water molecules. Using this number in the eq.
11 for the solution compressibility we can get explicit values for the interfacial
compressibility. As a results we obtained values with are higher than those in
EO-water solutions, and are very sensitive to the variation of the hydration
number. It is interesting to notice that the coincidence of the ρ and β behavior
as a function of temperature, i.e. the existence of a common temperature at
which both the quantity are independent on concentration, could be indicative
of a condition at which the second Virial coeﬃcient reduce to zero. The shape
change in nonionic micellar solution, from the sphere to rod, is evident on the
excess density where two diﬀerent regimes are present above and below the
transition temperature. These two regimes, in our model, reﬂect two diﬀerent
conformation and degree of hydration of the micellar interface. The change of
the interfacial properties with temperature is then a complex combination of
change in the EO conformation and of the degree of hydration and cannot be
reduced to excluded area per polar [4].

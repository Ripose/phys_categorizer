ABSTRACT:
General theorem describing a relation between diagonal of one-electron den-
sity matrix and a certain class of many-electron ensembles of determinant states
is proved. As a corollary to this theorem a constructive proof of suﬃciency of
Coleman’s representability conditions is obtained. It is shown that there exist rig-
orous schemes for construction of energy of many-electron system as functionals
of one-electron density.

Key words:

representability problem; density matrices; electron correla-

tion.

Introduction
In density functional theory (DFT) approaches it is accepted that the
electronic energy of many electron systems (at least for the ground state)
can be presented as a functional of the ﬁrst order density, or, in other words,
In this connection the
of the diagonal of the ﬁrst order density matrix.
following question seems to be pertinent: Are there rigorous schemes, that
do not involve approximations and hypothesis of any kind, for construction
of electronic energy as a functional of the ﬁrst order density ? In present
paper we make an attempt to answer this question.

The second question closely related to the ﬁrst one may be formulated as:
Is it possible to consider electronic energy of many-electron system for some
ﬁxed basis as a function of occupation numbers ? Recently orbital occupancy
(OO) approach developing this idea for DFT type functionals was formulated
[1-4]. In present paper we show how energy expressions involving diagonal el-
ements of the ﬁrst order density matrix may be rigorously constructed. Such
energy expressions may be used only in non-gradient optimization schemes
since these expressions are not diﬀerentiable in classic sense.

Basic Deﬁnitions

For a ﬁxed basis set of n orthonormal spin-orbitals the corresponding
ﬁnite-dimensional Fock space FN is spanned by determinants |Li where L
runs over all subsets of the spin-orbital index set N. Its p-electron sector
FN,p is spanned by determinants |Li with |L| = p. Basis determinants will
be labelled by subsets and all sign conventions connected with their repre-
sentation as the Grassman product of ordered spin-orbitals will be included
in the deﬁnition of the creation-annihilation operators.
The set of q-electron density operators is deﬁned as

EN,q = {tq ∈ FN,q ⊗ F ∗

N,q : t†

q = tq & tq ≥ 0 & T r(tq) = 1}

p-representable if there exists p-electron density operator tp ∈ EN,p such that

This deﬁnition is correct because the contraction operator possesses the prop-
erty

The set d(EN,p) is called the standard (unit) simplex of the operator space

of all p-element subsets of the index set N determines a face of Tn,p and its

complementary part generates the opposite face. In particular, there are
p
hyperfaces opposite to the corresponding vertices.

Weak representability problem may be formulated as the problem of de-
scription of the polyhedron WN,p,q with arbitrary admissible n, p, and q.
Since, by deﬁnition, density operators are Hermitean, this polyhedron may
be conveniently embedded into the real Euclidean space RN,q of the dimen-
with its canonical basis vectors eK labelled by q-element subsets of
sion
N. With such an embedding the tensor products of the fermion creation-
annihilation operators involved in the expression (3) should be replaced by

imposes the following restrictions on the admissible values of parameter µL0:

If µL0 6= 0 then we arrive at non-trivial representation of diagonal λ(0) as a

Deﬁnition 3. Sequence (L0, L1, . . . , Li, . . .) of p-element subsets of N is
called λ-admissible if for each i = 0, 1, . . . subset Li satisﬁes the condition
(23).

Theorem 2. For any vector λ(0) ∈ WN,p,1 the residual vector in iteration

formula (21) vanishes after a ﬁnite number of steps.

Proof. First let us note that the number of nonzero components of
representable residual vector λ(k) can not be less than p.
If this number
is equal to p then λ(k) just coincides with the vertex wp↓1(Lk) where Lk =

i∗

Ind(λ(k)), and the residual vector λ(k+1) vanishes. Let us suppose that the
number of nonzero components of λ(k) is greater than p. From Eqs.(15),
(17), and (19) it readily follows that there exists index i∗ ∈ Ind(λ(k)) such
that λ(k+1)
is necessarily equal either to zero or to 1
p. To complete the proof

it is suﬃcient to show that if λ(k)

Corollary 3. λ-admissible sequence (L0, L1, . . . , Lkλ) generated recur-
rently on the base of the iteration formula (21) includes pairwise distinct

It is to be noted that Theorem 2 is just a speciﬁcation of the fundamental
theorem by Carath´eodory [11]:

Theorem 3. Let X ⊂ Rn. Then any vector x ∈ Conv(X) may be
presented as a convex combination of no more than n + 1 vectors from X.
Modern proof of this result may be found in [12].

From Corollary 3 if follows that any mapping λ → sλ where sλ is a λ-
admissible sequence compatible with the iteration formula (21) determines
some global section (right inverse) π1↑p of the contraction operator 1
p!cp−1
that is the mapping from WN,p,1 to TN,p such that

for any λ ∈ WN,p,1. As it is seen from Eq.(22), sections constructed on the
base of the recurrence relation (21) are not linear and even not diﬀerentiable
in classic sense.

The most ambitious task arising in the frameworks of the approach out-
lined is to try to develop eﬃcient methods for direct optimization of energy
as a function of diagonal of the ﬁrst order density matrix. General scheme
embracing the whole class of such methods may be described as follows.
1. Some section(s) of the contraction operator should be chosen.
2. Using available section, it is possible of associate with some trial diag-
onal λ ensemble of p-electron determinant states and to determine squares
of the CI coeﬃcients:

|CLi|2 =

(see Eq.(24)).

3. Construct average energy

4. Minimize the function

to determine optimal diagonal and its expansion via vertices wp↓1(L).

There are no serious problems in implementation of steps 2-4 of this
scheme and the only complicated step is reasonable selection of mapping(s)
π1↑p (note that in general several diﬀerent sections may be employed in the
course of the energy optimization). It is rather diﬃcult to estimate a priori
the quality of some chosen concrete section π1↑p. There are two readily
coming to mind general algorithms to construct such sections. Both of them
involve full sorting of p-electron subsets of the spin-orbital index set.

1. Maximization of parameter (22) on each iteration: On the k-th step

current Lk may be determined from the condition

µLk = max

In this case it is not necessary to take into account Eq.(23) explicitly.

This section is probably optimal from formal mathematical viewpoint
but has no physical idea behind it. Computer experiments show that in
restoration process of such type high order excitations from the HF state
contribute mostly. Even if exact FCI occupancies for the ground state are
chosen, the restoration produces ensemble of determinant states that involves
HF determinant and excited determinants that practically do not interact
with the HF one.

2. Energy minimization: On the k-th iteration among subsets satisfying
the condition (23) it is chosen the subset Lk such that the lowest eigenvalue
of p-electron Hamiltonian in the basis {|L0 >, |L1 >, . . . , |Lk >} is minimal.
This is undoubtedly the best possible section of the contraction operator.
Unfortunately, the use of this section for the energy minimization is of no
sense because it is equivalent to a certain CI scheme that can be described
as follows.

1. First it is necessary to ﬁx the maximal number mdet of determinants

in wave function expansion and put k = 0;

2. Put k = k + 1;
3. Sort all determinants diﬀerent from the already chosen and select the
one that corresponds to the lowest eigenvalue of the Hamiltonian in the basis
of k determinants {|L1 >, |L2 >, . . . , |Lk >}. If k < mdet, return to step 2.
Finally in a certain sense optimal basis involving not greater than mdet
determinants will be obtained. This scheme is based on the well-known
bracketing theorem of matrix algebra (see, e.g.,[13]) and is used in quantum
chemistry for years in diﬀerent modiﬁcations to select initial determinant
space for multi-reference CI calculations [14, 15]. In our opinion this scheme
is interesting in its own right as a self-suﬃcient one when a relatively small
number of leading determinants should be constructed from active orbitals
with close orbital energies (the case that occurs extensively in transition
metal complexes) because

(1) CI spaces of huge dimensions can be eﬃciently handled and disk

memory usage is minimal;

(2) Calculations can be easily restarted;
(3) Algorithms are trivially parallelized and if, say, PC clusters are used,

data transfer via local net is minimal;

(4) It is easy to handle both single excited state and a group of successive

states.

For the restoration purpose the above scheme can be considered as a

8

certain benchmark one because it gives the best possible occupancies and
energy that can be obtained on the basis of the restoration routine described
by Theorem 2.

Conclusion
General theorem establishing a connection between diagonal of the ﬁrst
order density matrix and a certain set of many-electron wave functions is
proved.
It is shown that rigorous energy expression involving only one-
electron density becomes well-deﬁned as soon as a certain right inverse of
the contraction operator is chosen. For a ﬁxed representable diagonal of the
ﬁrst order density matrix there exist quite a number of ways to restore p-
electron determinant ensembles that are contracted to the diagonal under
consideration. Each such way is in fact a path of a rather complicated graph
with its vertices labelled by admissible (in sense of deﬁnition 3) p-element
spin-orbital index sets. The main problem arising in implementation of op-
timization schemes based on such energy expressions is the lack of general
simple algorithms for selection of admissible paths for restoration of wave
functions from one-electron densities. Such algorithms, besides requirement
being simple, should generate paths close in a certain sense to ones obtained
by the benchmark calculations based on the bracketing theorem. Search for
such algorithms is in progress now. Note in conclusion that the recurrence
formula (21) can be easily generalized to treat densities of higher order and
the only obstacle here is the lack of the complete set of inequalities for ana-
lytic description of the polyhedron WN,p,q in the case q > 1.

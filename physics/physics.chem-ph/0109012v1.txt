Abstract

Electron injection from an adsorbed molecule to the substrate (heterogeneous elec-

tron transfer) is studied. One reaction coordinate is used to model this process. The

surface phonons and/or the electron-hole pairs together with the internal degrees

of freedom of the adsorbed molecule as well as possibly a liquid surrounding the

molecule provide a dissipative environment, which may lead to dephasing, relax-

ation, and sometimes excitation of the relevant system. In the process studied the

adsorbed molecule is excited by a light pulse. This is followed by an electron transfer

from the excited donor state to the quasi-continuum of the substrate. It is assumed

that the substrate is a semiconductor. The eﬀects of dissipation on electron injection

are investigated.

1 Introduction

In recent years electron transfer (ET) between molecular adsorbates and semi-

conductor nanomaterials and surfaces has been subject of much research [1].

The injection of an electron into the conduction band is a prototype reaction

for a lot of electrochemical and photoelectrochemical interfacial processes such

as photography, solar energy conversion, quantum dot devices, etc. [1]. Inter-

facial ET between discrete molecular levels and a conducting surface is the

simplest of all surface reactions: it involves only the exchange of an electron,

and so no bonds are broken [2].

The ultrafast nature of the charge injection from adsorbed molecules to the

conduction band of semiconductor surfaces was shown in recent experiments

[3–5]. The theoretical description of such experiments demands an adequate

treatment of the ET dynamics to be able to describe short time-scale phenom-

ena such as coherences. This can be done within the reduced density matrix

(RDM) description used in the present contribution.

Recently [6,7] the electron injection from a chromophore to a semiconductor

conduction band was described using the time-dependent Schr¨odinger equa-

tion, thus neglecting relaxation processes. The neglect of relaxation processes

was motivated by the experimental ﬁnding that injected electrons relax only

within 150 fs in the perylene-TiO2 system. Here we include relaxation to be

able to treat a larger class of experiments where, for example, the adsorbed

molecule is surrounded by a liquid environment, and longer times.

2 Theory

In the RDM theory the full system is divided into a relevant system part and

a heat bath. Therefore the total Hamiltonian consists of three terms – the

system part HS, the bath part HB, and the system-bath interaction HSB:

H = HS + HB + HSB.

(1)

The RDM ρ is obtained from the density matrix of the full system by tracing

out the degrees of freedom of the environment. This reduction together with

a second-order perturbative treatment of HSB and the Markov approximation

leads to the Redﬁeld equation [8–11]:

˙ρ = −i[HS, ρ] + Rρ = Lρ.

In this equation R denotes the Redﬁeld tensor. If one assumes bilinear system-

bath coupling with system part K and bath part Φ

HSB = KΦ

one can take advantage of the following decomposition [12,11]:

˙ρ = −i [HS, ρ] + [Λρ, K] + [K, ρΛ†].

The Λ operator can be written in the form

Λ =

dτ hΦ(τ )Φ(0)iK I(−τ )

∞

Z
0

where K I(−τ ) = e−iHtKeiHt is the operator K in the interaction representa-

tion.

The system bath interaction is taken to be linear in the reaction coordinate

as well as in the bath coordinates. Neither the rotating wave nor the secular

approximation have been invoked. The so-called diabatic damping approxi-

mation which has numerical advantages [13] is not used because it could lead

to wrong results in the present system studied [14,15].

In the following we direct our attention to ET between an excited molecular

state and a conduction band. The Hamiltonian modeling this system consists

of the ground and one excited state of the molecule and a quasi-continuum

describing the conduction band together with one vibrational coordinate

H =

Ha|φaihφa| +

(Vke|φkihφe| + H.c.) .

Here a can be equal to g for the ground state, e for the excited state, and k for

the quasi-continuum. As in Ref. [6] we choose the frequency of the vibrational

mode to be ¯hωvib = 0.1 eV. The coupling between the excited state and the

continuum states is assumed to be constant: Vek = 0.1 eV. A box-shaped

uniform density of states is used. Instead of modeling the excitation from

the ground state explicitly we assume a δ-pulse. The excited state potential

energy surface is shifted 0.1 ˚A along the reaction coordinate with respect to

the ground state potential energy surface. This results in an initial vibrational

wave packet on the excited state with signiﬁcant population in the lowest 4 - 5

vibrational states. The shift between the excited state energy surface and the

continuum parabola is 0.2 ˚A. The thermal bath is characterized by its spectral

density J(ω) =

m γmδ(ω − ωm). Because all system oscillators have the same

frequency the coupling to the bath can be given by one parameter γ1 in the

P

diabatic damping approximation. Denoting the eﬀective mass of the harmonic

oscillator by M the strength of the damping is chosen as γ1π/(Mωvib) =

0.1 eV.

To be able to study the eﬀects of dissipation we do not model the quasi-

continuum with such a large number of electronic states as in Ref. [6]. In

that work a band of width 2 eV was described using an energy diﬀerence

of 2.5 meV leading to 801 electronic surfaces. These calculations are already

demanding using wave packet propagation but almost impossible using direct

density matrix propagation. For doing such a large system one would have to

use the Monte Carlo wave function scheme [16,17]. We use a much simpler

model and describe only that part of the conduction band which really takes

part in the injection process. The total width of the conduction band may be

signiﬁcantly larger. In the following, a band of width 0.75 eV is treated with

31 electronic surfaces. In each of these electronic states ﬁve vibrational states

are taken into account. We are aware that this is only a minimal model but

hope that it catches the eﬀects of dissipation on the electron injection process.

3 Results

Here we look at two diﬀerent populations arising in the process of electron

injection. The time-dependent population of the electronic states in the con-

duction band is calculated as the sum over the vibrational levels of each elec-

tronic surface P (k, t) =

ν Pk,ν(t). As a second quantity we look at the time-

dependent population of the vibrational levels of the excited molecular state

P

Pe(ν, t). These two probability distributions give some hints on the eﬀect of

dissipation.

Figure 1 shows the electronic population for the quasi-continuum, i.e. the

probability distribution of the injected electron, versus the energy of the con-

duction band. As described above, the four lowest vibrational states are pop-

ulated signiﬁcantly at t = 0. The structure arising in the upper panel of Fig. 1

was already explained by Ramakrishna et al. [6]. It can be estimated using

the golden rule. The electronic probabilities in the quasi-continuum are given

as

P (k, t) ≈

Pµ

(i)|hχlµ|χkνi|2δ(E0 + µ¯hωvib − E − ν¯hωvib)

(7)

Xµ,ν

where Pµ

(i) is the initial vibronic distribution in the excited state and |χlµi

and |χkνi are the vibronic parts of the wave packet in the excited and quasi-

continuum states, respectively. The energy E0 denotes the middle of the band.

Turning on dissipation two eﬀects can be seen. First, the vibrational popula-

tions in the excited state of the molecule no longer only decay into the quasi-

continuum states but also relax within the excited state (see Fig. 2). Second,

the vibrational populations also relax within the quasi-continuum states. The

recurrences back into the excited state become much smaller. Only those parts

of the wave packet which are still high enough in energy can go back to the

molecule.

In summary, we extended the work by Ramakrishna, Willig, and May [6] by

including relaxation processes into the description of electron injection into the

conduction band of a semiconductor. This will, at least, become important for

modeling electron injection in the presence of a ﬂuid surrounding the attached

molecule.

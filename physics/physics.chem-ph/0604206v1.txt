Abstract

The correlation energies of the helium isoelectronic sequence and of Hooke’s atom

isoelectronic sequence have been evaluated using an assortment of local, gradient and

meta-gradient density functionals. The results are compared with the exact correlation

energies, showing that while several of the more recent density functionals reproduce

the exact correlation energies of the helium isoelectronic sequence rather closely, none

is satisfactory for Hooke’s atom isoelectronic sequence. It is argued that the uniformly

acceptable results for the helium sequence can be explained through simple scaling

arguments that do not hold for Hooke’s atom sequence, so that the latter system

provides a more sensitive testing ground for approximate density functionals. This

state of aﬀairs calls for further eﬀort towards formulating correlation-energy density

functionals that would be truly universal at least for spherically-symmetric two-fermion

systems.

1 Introduction

Density functional theory (dft) can be implemented in a variety of ways, all of which have

their roots in the pre-Hohenberg-Kohn era. A fully consistent implementation requires the

formulation of density functionals for the kinetic energy as well as for the exchange and

correlation energies, none of which can be expressed in terms of the one-particle density

in a straightforward way. The Kohn-Sham formulation depends on the construction of a

local one-body potential that incorporates the eﬀect of interelectronic repulsion, giving rise

to a ground state density that coincides with that derived from the solution of the exact

many-body hamiltonian. Finally, an approximate approach, based on the fact that the

Hartree-Fock density is fairly close to the exact one, proposes that the exact ground state

energy be evaluated by adding to the Hartree-Fock energy a correlation energy, calculated

in terms of the Hartree-Fock density by means of an appropriate density functional.

Since the ultimate correlation-energy density functional, whose existence is guaranteed

by the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem, remains elusive, the development and testing of ever im-

proved density functionals keeps being vigorously pursued. For an extensive recent study see

Kurth, Perdew and Blaha [1]. In this vein, Chakravorty et al. [2] and Jarzecki and Davidson

[3] compared the exact and dft correlation energies across the helium (and other) atomic iso-

electronic sequences. In the former article the exact correlation energy for the ground state

of the helium isoelectronic sequence (as well as for all other atomic isoelectronic sequences

with up to 18 electrons) is compared with the values obtained using six density functionals

(i.e., LYP [4], CS [5], VWN-SPP [6], PZ [7], B88 [8], LC [9] — the acronyms will be explained

below). Of these, only the LYP correlation energies are uniformly close to the exact values

over the range of nuclear charges examined. B88 grows to become twice as large as the exact

correlation energy, and all the others seem to diverge for large Z. The latter article extends

this study, considering P86 [10], LYP [4] (again), and PW91 [11] as well as various combi-

nations of these with exchange functionals. While, as noted above, the correlation energy

obtained with the LYP functional (evaluated for the Hartree-Fock density) follows the exact

correlation energy rather closely, this is not the case if the same functional is combined with

3

Becke’s exchange functional. On the other hand, the combination BP86 (Becke’s exchange

with the P86 correlation functional) exhibits a rather close agreement with the exact corre-

lation energies for the helium isoelectronic sequence. The overall conclusion of these authors

is “all DFT functionals, [...] reveal problems in descriptions of the energy as a function of

nuclear charge” [3]. Correlation energies were also evaluated by Umrigar and Gonze [12] for

several members of the helium isoelectronic sequence, in terms of both local and GGA-type

density functionals.

The high Z limit of the helium (and other) isoelectronic sequences within dft was carefully

examined by Whittingham and Burke [13], who pointed out that some correlation-energy

functionals do not scale correctly to the high-density limit. In particular, the local-density

approximation diverges logarithmically at large Z, and the Perdew-Wang (PW91) functional

[11] fails as well. They note that PBE [14] was designed to correct for this failure.

The over-estimate of atomic correlation energies by local density approximations based

on the homogeneous electron gas has been analyzed by Tong [15], who attributed it to

the continuous excitation spectrum of the latter, inﬁnitely extending, system, that allows

for a “soft” response to the internuclear repulsion. A modiﬁcation of the local density

approximation, in which an energy gap is introduced, was recently studied by Rey and Savin

[16]. Their results suggest that the inhomogeneity needs to be introduced more explicitly.

An analysis of the properties that correlation-energy density functionals should satisfy in

order to present a valid behavior along isoelectronic sequences was presented by Staroverov et

al. [17], who, as Whittingham and Burke [13], studied the high Z limit of some two-electron

atomic ions. Furthermore, an interesting methodological discussion of the construction of

density functionals was recently presented by Perdew et al.

[18]. These authors make a

strong case for nonempirical functionals and speciﬁcally recommend the PBE [14] and the

TPSS [19] functionals.

Hooke’s atom consists of two “electrons” that repel one another like ordinary electrons

but are bound to the “nucleus” via harmonic potentials. Its separability, in center-of-mass

and relative coordinates, was pointed out by Kestner and Sinanoglu [20], and the fact that

4

for certain values of the force constant it is analytically solvable was noted by Kais et al.

[21] and, more systematically, by Taut [22]. Several studies for Hooke’s atom have been per-

formed, aimed at deriving exact density functionals or Kohn-Sham type exchange-correlation

potentials [23-25], most notably by Burke et al. [26-30] and Ludena et al. [31]. However, a

systematic study over a broad range of force constants has not been presented, to the best

of our knowledge, with the exception of the local-density calculations that were carried out

by Huang and Umrigar [32].

In the present paper we examine an assortment of correlation-energy density functionals

proposed over the last seventy(!) years. Virtually each one of them had been tested for the

helium atom, and most of them had been tested for a range of atomic ions isoelectronic with

helium. Needless to say, many of them have been applied, with varying degrees of success,

to the study of heavier atoms as well as molecules, surfaces and solids, and share the credit

for the immense impact of dft in all these areas.

The Hohenberg-Kohn theorem implies that the ground-state correlation energy is a uni-

versal functional of the ground state density. The examination of the extent to which the

commonly used correlation-energy density functionals satisfy this property is the principal

aim of the present paper. This is carried out by considering the performance of the presently

selected set of correlation energy density functionals for Hooke’s atom isoelectronic sequence.

Since these density functionals were originally developed for Coulombic (atomic and molec-

ular) systems, their performance for Hooke’s atom provides a severe test of their universal

validity. Moreover, Hooke’s atom remains bound over the whole range, 0 < k <

, of the

∞

force constant. This fact allows correlation to be examined not only in the high k (weak

correlation) limit but also in the low k (strong correlation) limit. The latter limit is not

available for atomic systems, that become unbound below a certain critical nuclear charge.

This property of Hooke’s atom isoelectronic sequence is elaborated upon below.

Another model system with similar properties is that of a two interacting particles con-

ﬁned to a spherical volume. Here, the radius of the sphere provides a parameter that, upon

variation, can be used to change the system from the low correlation to the strong correla-

5

tion limit. This system was recently studied in detail by Jung et al. [33] who also compared

the exact exchange and correlation energies with those obtained by some few approximate

functionals. Thus, the combined results of their and our study provide detailed insight into

the accuracies of currently applied approximate density functionals and, consequently, may

be used in improving those.

Ultimately, the physical reason behind the existence of correlation eﬀects is the electron-

electron interactions. Thus, the total correlation energy can be written in terms of a double-

integral over two position coordinates, involving the exact and the Hartree-Fock ﬁrst and

second order reduced density matrices,

(1)

(2)

Ec =

ρ(~r1)ρ(~r2)˜ǫc(~r1, ~r2)d3~r1d3~r2,

Z Z

where ˜ǫc(~r1, ~r2) is a unique correlation-energy density in a six-dimensional (~r1, ~r2) space. On

the other hand, in density functional theory it is common practice to write the correlation

energy as

Ec =

ρ(~r)ǫc(~r)d3~r.

Z

The transformation from Eq. (1) to Eq. (2) is not unique. Therefore, diﬀerent approximate

expressions for ǫc(~r) may look very diﬀerent but nevertheless give very close total correlation

energies Ec [34]. Thus, since the approximate correlation-energy functionals most often are

given in terms of approximate forms for ǫc(~r), it is not possible to compare those directly

and thereby obtain information on their performance.

Instead, only the total correlation energy is of physical relevance. Therefore, by consid-

ering the total correlation energy for continuous classes of systems detailed information on

the performance of approximate density functionals can be obtained, that ultimately can be

used in assessing their performance as well as in improving them. The helium isoelectronic

sequence provides such a class of systems, as also is the case for Hooke’s atom sequence.

However, as brieﬂy pointed out above and as we shall demonstrate more carefully below,

the former sequence is less general than what initially may be assumed, making it less in-

formative for studies of approximate energy functionals. On the other hand, as we shall

6

also demonstrate, Hooke’s atoms provide a class of systems for which the members are “less

similar” than is the case for the helium sequence, making a detailed study of this sequence

highly relevant.

We ﬁnally add that correlation energy is deﬁned diﬀerently in wave function methods

and in density functional theory. Since the numerical diﬀerences are not large and not will

aﬀect any of the conclusions of the present work, we shall not discuss this distinction further.

requires consultation of ref. [19], [35], [14], and [11].

We note that this classiﬁcation is closely related to the common classiﬁcation into local

density approximations (LDAs), generalized-gradient approximations (GGAs) and meta-

GGAs. However, by restricting the classiﬁcation according to the behavior for a spherical

two-electron system, for a given functional we sometimes arrive at an expression that belongs

to a lower class, in the classiﬁcation speciﬁed above, than the general case. Our classiﬁcation

here applies to this reduced expression.

Both as an additional check of the computations and to gain further insight into the

behavior of the various density functionals considered, we examine the weak correlation limit

3.1 Wigner’s functional

the functional [38]

(5)

In the weak-correlation limit (i.e., when either Z

or k

) Wigner’s correla-

tion energy for a two-electron system becomes

0.113, which is roughly twice

as large as the corresponding (rather similar) limiting values of the helium and Hooke’s

atom isoelectronic sequences. A closer examination yields EW

6 Performance of the various density functionals

The Hartree-Fock densities were evaluated for both the helium and Hooke’s isoelectronic

sequences, using the procedure described in ref. [49]. These densities were used to compute

the correlation energies in terms of the various density functionals speciﬁed above. The

results are presented in Tables 1-6, where comparisons with previous pertinent results are

documented, as well as in Figures 1-8. When comparing the diﬀerent results it is important

to pay attention to the ranges of the correlation energy scales in the diﬀerent Figures. Thus,

Fig. 1, presenting the 0OA correlation energies for the helium isoelectronic sequence, has a

range ﬁve times as large as Fig. 2 (crude 1OA), whose range is three times as large as that

of Fig. 3 (better 1OA). The 2OA results, presented in Fig. 4, do not improve on the best

1OA results in Fig. 3. The overall trend is similar for Hooke’s atom isoelectronic sequence,

but much less pronounced. Thus, the range of Fig. 5 (0OA) is twice that of Fig. 6 (crude

1OA), where the range of deviations of the dft correlation energies from the exact values is

only a factor of 1.5 broader than that in Fig. 7 (better 1OA). Again, the 2OA correlation

energies do not improve on the best 1OA results.

The four 0OA functionals presented in Fig. 1 for the helium isoelectronic sequence fail

to provide an adequate estimate of the correlation energy. Only BR provides the correct

correlation energy for the helium atom, because it had been calibrated to do so. Wigner’s

is the only 0OA-type functional providing a mild dependence on the nuclear charge (Z),

that mimics the exact correlation energy, though it is more than twice as large.

In fact,

the Wigner and BR correlation-energy functionals are the only local density functionals

considered, that yield ﬁnite correlation energies for Z

. Needless to say, since PW is

→ ∞

the deﬁnitive LDA limit, its failings should be taken as a genuine assessment of this level of

approximation. That other 0OA-type correlation energies are in closer agreement with the

exact results should be interpreted as fortuitous. It is regrettable that a “ﬁrst-principles”

benchmark 1OA correlation energy density cannot be speciﬁed in a similar way, or has not

so far been proposed. For Hooke’s atom all zero order approximations considered, presented

in Fig. 5, are roughly equally poor. At intermediate values of the force constant the ordering

18

of the various approximations relative to the exact correlation energy is similar to that for

the helium isoelectronic sequence.

The ﬁrst-order functionals were split into two classes according to their behavior for the

helium isoelectronic sequence. The more poorly behaved functionals, P86, OP and Becke,

are presented in Fig. 2. They exhibit a strong dependence on the nuclear charge. The ﬁve

functionals presented in Fig. 3 all have a reasonable slope, only mildly steeper than that

of the exact correlation energy. Both PBE and Becke have been parameterized to yield

the exact correlation energy for the helium atom. For Hooke’s atom isoelectronic sequence

most 1OA results, except P86, cluster together, being roughly twice as large as the exact

correlation energy. We note that TPSS and FT97 are remarkably close to one another; so are

PBE and PKZB. Neither pair remains close for the helium isoelectronic sequence. Rather,

PBE and TPSS behave similarly; so do FT97 and PKZB, even more closely but further away

from the exact correlation energy. These contradictory patterns serve as a warning against

assigning excessive signiﬁcance to limited scope examination of the comparative performance

of diﬀerent density functionals.

The three second-order approximations considered are presented, for the helium isoelec-

tronic sequence, in Fig. 4. LYP has the overall most satisfactory behavior, although for

Z < 6 CS is in closer agreement with the exact correlation energies. For Hooke’s sequence

(cf. Fig. 8), none of the second-order approximations provides a good agreement with the

exact correlation energies. LYP and CS, which are conceptually related, are remarkably close

to one another, along Hooke’s atom isoelectronic sequence; however, this is not true for the

helium isoelectronic sequence.

As already pointed out, Hooke’s atom isoelectronic sequence allows the examination of

the weak binding (high correlation) limit, k

0. The computed correlation energies for the

range of lower force constants suggest that

although, in both cases, the correlation energies are considerably higher than the exact

correlation energies, even for the lowest force constants considered. These results may be

taken to suggest that at very low force constants the local density approximation becomes

exact, since the density is spread out and its gradient becomes negligibly low. A similar
behavior is observed for the ratios EF T 97

deliberately built into any of these approximations. It is, therefore, noteworthy that it holds

to the extent that it does.

Our study clearly suggests that the approximate density functionals in general perform

better for the helium sequence than for Hooke’s atoms. In order to understand this behavior

we show in Fig. 9 scaled electron densities, i.e., ρ/c3, as well as dρ

of x = c

0.06649 for Hooke’s atoms.

A number of observations can be made from the ﬁgure. First, the curves for the He

sequence are all remarkably similar, except for the region r

0, where the cusp problem

becomes visible, in particular for the second-order derivative. An analogous similarity is not

found for Hooke’s atoms. The curves corresponding to the highest values of k are indeed very

close to the expected k

limit, but the range of k is broad enough to allow signiﬁcant

→ ∞

deviations from this limiting behavior.

It follows that the He sequence does not provide

a useful testing ground for exploring approximate density functionals, as long as it is not

−

→

extended with further test systems.

Second, the electron density is more conﬁned in space for the He sequence than for

Hooke’s atoms. For the former, the cusp problem may be important since the region for

r

→

0 is one of a large energy density although its volume is vanishing. A similar region

does not exist for Hooke’s atoms, i.e., for those systems the electron density is not maximized

in a region of diverging potential. This suggests a further reason for using Hooke’s atoms

as model systems for studying properties of electron densities in regions where the potential

20

stays ﬁnite. This is exactly what is relevant when developing approximate density functionals

aimed at describing the properties of chemical bonds.

7 Conclusions

A word is appropriate about the choice of density functionals investigated. We did try to

be fairly exhaustive. Some functionals were included primarily to respect the pioneers, most

notably Wigner, although we have not made justice to contributions by Pines [50], Gell-

Mann and Brueckner [51], Hedin [52], and many others. We did exclude a couple of recent

functionals either because the correlation energies they provide for helium were judged to

be poor, because no result was available to verify our implementation, or because they were

considerably harder to implement.

In the cases excluded we did not have a compelling

reason to expect a particularly good performance for the helium sequence, let alone Hooke’s

sequence. We may have excluded highly worth-while functionals by oversight or ignorance,

for which we apologize.

It has already been noted by several authors that most density functionals fail to yield an

adequate dependence of the correlation energy on the nuclear charge, Z, along isoelectronic

sequences. However, some, such as PBE, TPSS, CS and LYP are not too bad. None of

that is true for Hooke’s sequence, suggesting that the ultimate aim of developing a universal

density functional has not yet been attained, not even for spherically-symmetric two-fermion

systems. By analysing the electron densities for the two classes of systems, we found that

the He sequence does not provide a suﬃciently general class of systems for assessing or

improving the quality of density functionals, whereas this is to a larger extent the case for

Hooke’s atom isoelectronic sequence. A feasible approach to improving the universality of

correlation energy density functionals could be to examine their reparametrization, allowing

for a dependence on the one-body potential. Since this potential is uniquely determined by

the ground-state Hartree-Fock density, this approach is still consistent with the Hohenberg-

Kohn framework of dft.

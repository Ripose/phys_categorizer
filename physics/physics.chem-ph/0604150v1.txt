A general method for computing kinetic isotope eﬀects is described. The method uses
the quantum-instanton approximation and is based on the thermodynamic integration
with respect to the mass of the isotopes and on the path-integral Monte-Carlo evalua-
tion of relevant thermodynamic quantities. The central ingredients of the method are
the Monte-Carlo estimators for the logarithmic derivatives of the partition function and
the delta–delta correlation function. Several alternative estimators for these quantities
are described here and their merits are compared on the benchmark hydrogen-exchange
reaction, H+H2 →H2+H on the Truhlar–Kuppermann potential energy surface. Finally,
a qualitative discussion of issues arising in many-dimensional systems is provided.

1 Introduction

Measurement and theoretical predictions of kinetic isotope eﬀects belong among
the main tools of chemical kinetics. Kinetic isotope eﬀect (KIE) is deﬁned as the
ratio kA/kB of rate constants for two isotopomers A and B. Isotopomers A and
B are two chemical species diﬀering only by replacing a group of atoms in chemi-
cal species A by their isotopes in species B. Recently, observation of anomalously
large KIEs has helped prove importance of quantum eﬀects in enzymatic reactions
at physiological (i.e. surprisingly high) temperatures [1]. This and similar results
have changed our understanding of enzymatic catalysis and spurred an active ex-
perimental and theoretical research in the last several years.

Since the early days of chemical kinetics, KIEs have been predominantly de-
scribed from the perspective of the transition-state theory (TST) [2,3]. This theory
is intrinsically classical, although various quantum “corrections” have been incor-
porated in it over time. These include corrections due to the zero-point-energy
eﬀects, high-temperature Wigner tunneling correction [2, 3], and various semiclas-
sical approximations for treating the tunneling at low temperatures [4–6]. On the
other end of the spectrum are exact quantum-mechanical methods for computing
rate constants and KIEs [7], but in general these are not feasible for systems with
many degrees of freedom. One therefore resorts to various approximations that
make a computation practicable but are less severe than the TST. Among these
belongs a variety of quantum transition-state theories [8–10], the most recent of
which is the quantum instanton (QI) approximation [11], motivated by an earlier
semiclassical instanton model [4]. In this contribution, we describe a method [12],

based on the QI approximation, for computing KIEs directly, rather than via com-
puting the rate constants for the two isotopomers ﬁrst. Because of the ultimate goal
of applying a similar method to enzymatic reactions, the method is implemented
using a general path-integral approach that scales favorably with the number of
degrees of freedom. Several alternative estimators for relevant quantities have been
developed [12, 13] and their relative merits are compared in this contribution on
the benchmark hydrogen atom–diatom exchange reaction.

2 Quantum instanton approximation for the kinetic isotope eﬀects

The quantum-instanton approximation for the rate constant was introduced in
Ref. [11]. A simpler alternative derivation [14] described in detail in Ref. [12], starts
with the Miller–Schwartz–Tromp formula [15] for the thermal rate constant k,

k Qr =

dt Cﬀ (t) .

∞

0
Z

Here Qr is the reactant partition function (per unit volume for bimolecular reac-
tions) and Cﬀ (t) is the symmetrized ﬂux–ﬂux correlation function,

Cﬀ (t) = tr

e−β ˆH/2 ˆFae−β ˆH/2ei ˆHt/~ ˆFbe−i ˆHt/~

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

with Hamiltonian operator ˆH and ﬂux operator ˆFγ denoting the ﬂux through the
dividing surface γ = a, b. Quantum instanton expression follows by multiplying and
dividing the integrand of Eq.(1) by the “delta–delta” correlation function Cdd(t)
deﬁned below in Eq. (5), assuming that Cﬀ (t)/Cdd(t) varies slowly compared with
Cdd(t), and applying the steepest descent approximation to the resulting integral.
Assuming further that the stationary-phase point is at t = 0, we obtain the QI
thermal rate constant,

Here ∆H is a speciﬁc type of energy variance [16],

and the delta–delta correlation function Cdd(t) is deﬁned [12, 16] as

Cdd(t) = tr

e−β ˆH/2 ˆ∆ae−β ˆH/2ei ˆHt/~ ˆ∆be−i ˆHt/~
(cid:16)

(cid:17)

.

The generalized delta operator ˆ∆ will be deﬁned below in Eq. (22).

In applying the QI approximation to the KIEs, it is useful to consider a con-
tinuous change of the isotope mass. If the two isotopomers are A and B, a real
parameter λ

[0, 1] can be deﬁned such that

∈

mi(λ) = mA,i(1

λ) + mB,iλ ,

Quantum instanton evaluation of the kinetic isotope eﬀects

where mA,i and mB,i are the masses of the ith atom in the isotopomers A and B,
respectively. Within the QI approximation (3), the KIE can be expressed as

KIEQI =

kQI(0)
kQI(1)

=

Qr(1)
Qr(0) ×

∆H(1)
∆H(0) ×

Cdd(0)
Cdd(1) ×

Cﬀ (0)/Cdd(0)
Cﬀ (1)/Cdd(1)

,

(6)

where the argument denotes the value of λ and for simplicity the time argument
of the correlation functions has been omitted since it is always t = 0 in the QI
approximation. Also, for convenience, both numerator and denominator have been
divided by Cdd(λ).

Four types of quantities must be evaluated in order to compute the KIEs from
Eq. (6): the ratio of the partition functions Qr(1)/Qr(0), the ratio of the delta
correlation functions Cdd(1)/Cdd(0), and the energy variance ∆H(λ) and the “ve-
locity” factor Cﬀ (λ)/Cdd(λ) for λ = 0 and 1. The last two quantities are in the
form of thermodynamic averages (for a given λ) and therefore can be directly com-
puted by Metropolis Monte-Carlo techniques; the relevant estimators have been
derived in Refs. [16, 17]. The most general forms are listed in Ref. [12]. The ﬁrst
two quantities cannot be evaluated directly since they are ratios of quantities for
two diﬀerent values of λ.

An elegant solution exists, however. Here is where considering a continuous iso-
tope change (using a parameter λ) becomes useful: instead of computing the ratios
directly, we use the thermodynamic integration idea [18], applied to the parameter
λ (i.e., to the masses of the isotopes instead to the usual inverse temperature β).
We can express the two ratios as an exponential of the integrals of logarithmic
derivatives,

Since the logarithmic derivatives can be expanded as

they are normalized quantities (thermodynamic averages) which can be directly
computed by the Metropolis algorithm. We can compute ratios of both the reactant
partition functions and the delta–delta correlation functions at λ = 0 and 1, by
computing the values of the corresponding logarithmic derivatives for enough values
λ between 0 and 1, and then by integrating over λ and exponentiating, according
to Eqs. (7) and (8).

In fact, in a cruder version of the QI method, called the simplest quantum
instanton (SQI) approximation [11], the ratios of the partition and delta–delta
correlation functions are all we need, since within that approximation, the kinetic
isotope eﬀect is just

The relevant estimators for the logarithmic derivatives have been derived in
Refs. [12, 13]. In Ref. [12], thermodynamic estimators have been derived that dif-
ferentiate the kinetic part of the action; in Ref. [13], virial estimators have been
derived that diﬀerentiate the potential part of the action. In both cases, the deriva-
tions have been done for general systems with N atoms in d dimensions, even for
cases with unbound degrees of freedom (such as the center-of-mass motion).
In
the next section, we present a simpliﬁed derivation of these estimators for a single
particle in a one-dimensional external potential. This choice signiﬁcantly simpliﬁes
notation, but preserves the main ingredients of the many-dimensional derivation.

3 Estimators for the logarithmic derivatives of Qr and Cdd

Below we derive three types of estimators for the logarithmic derivatives of both
Qr and Cdd. We refer to the three types of estimators as thermodynamic, virial, and
generalized virial because of their resemblance to corresponding thermodynamic
[19], virial [20], and generalized virial [21] estimators for the kinetic energy.

3.1 Partition function

Let us consider a single particle of mass m in a one-dimensional potential V (r).
Since we have only one mass m, we do not need to deﬁne an additional parameter
λ: we can just take m itself to be the parameter for the thermodynamic integration.
The PI representation of the partition function is

Above are three estimators for the logarithmic derivative: the ﬁrst one suitable if
the MC simulation is done in mass-scaled coordinates x, the other two for original
Cartesian coordinates r. The ﬁrst two suggest evaluation of the derivative numeri-
cally, by ﬁnite diﬀerences, which will be in fact, more eﬃcient in many dimensional
systems than the analytical third expression that requires the knowledge of the
gradient of the potential. Only for systems with few degrees of freedom and avail-
able gradient of the potential, the third expression may be preferable. The trick of
using numerical derivatives with respect to a single parameter was originally used
by Predescu for computing heat capacities [22] and higher temporal derivatives
of the ﬂux–ﬂux correlation function [23] where the parameters were the inverse
temperature and the imaginary time, respectively.

The simplest virial estimators (15) have one shortcoming compared to the ther-
modynamic estimators, namely, they only work in bound systems. This can be
immediately seen by considering a free particle with V (r) = 0. This shortcoming
can be remedied if the rescaling is done only after subtracting an arbitrarily chosen

and in general, we can replace r(P ) in all three forms (19) of the estimator by rc.
Since the number of slices P appears explicitly only in the denominator of the
generalized virial estimator (19) or (20), the statistical error should be independent
of P for a ﬁxed number of Monte-Carlo samples. On the other hand, P appears
explicitly in the numerator of the thermodynamic estimator (12), so the error is
expected to grow with P . This will be conﬁrmed in the numerical example in
Section 4.

3.2 Delta−delta correlation function

The derivation for Cdd is similar. However, due to the constraints to the two
dividing surfaces, a new term appears in the estimator. The PI representation of

The generalization to more-dimensional systems is fairly straightforward. Only
in the case of the simple virial estimator (15) or (27), care must be taken to ac-
count for the unbound (free) degrees of freedom by appropriately rescaling the
corresponding volume. For instance, for bimolecular reactions, the potential in the
reactant region is independent of the center-of-mass-coordinate and the relative
coordinate of the two molecules. For details, see Ref. [13].

In Ref. [12], the QI procedure for evaluating KIEs was successfully tested on sev-
eral problems of increasing complexity: the one-dimensional Eckart barrier and the

isotopic variants of both the collinear and the three-dimensional hydrogen-exchange
H2+H. The results for the KIE = k(H+H2)/k(D+D2) as a func-
reaction H+H2 →
tion of the inverse temperature 1/T for both collinear and three-dimensional ver-
sions of the reaction are also shown here in Fig. 1. The ﬁgure compares the exact
quantum-mechanical result [12, 24] with the results of the QI, SQI, and TST ap-
proximations. The three-dimensional version also shows the result of the canonical
variational TST with semiclassical tunneling correction (CVT) [25]. In general, the
results of the QI approximation are very good: the error is smaller than 10% for
temperatures 250 to 600 K. For lower temperatures, the larger error is due to us-
ing a single dividing surface: results can be improved by considering two separate
dividing surfaces. At high temperatures, the error is due to classical recrossing
and cannot be corrected within the QI approximation. For further details of the
calculation see Ref. [12].

(a) the collinear version, (b) the three-dimensional version.

Three types of estimators for the logarithmic derivative of Qr, given in Eqs. (12),
(15), and (20), are compared in Fig. 2. This calculation is for the collinear version of
the KIE = k(H+H2)/k(D+D2) at 300 K. The calculation was done with 10 walkers
and a ﬁxed number 105 Monte-Carlo moves for all P . The left part of the ﬁgure
shows the convergence of the partition-function ratio Qr(1)/Qr(0) as a function of
the number of slices P . The ratio was computed via the thermodynamic integration

used. The right panel shows the P -dependence of the relative error of Qr(1)/Qr(0).
As expected, for large P , the error of the generalized virial estimator (20) is almost
independent of P . On the other hand the error of the thermodynamic estimator (12)
grows with P . Even for small P , the generalized virial estimator is superior. Finally,
we can see the importance of subtracting the centroid motion before rescaling in Eq.
(17) by comparing errors of the simple (15) and generalized (20) virial estimators.
The diﬀerence is due to the fact that we have two free degrees of freedom in the
reactant region of the collinear bimolecular reaction. Similar conclusions (not shown
here) can be obtained for the ratio Cdd(1)/Cdd(0), except that the error of the
generalized virial estimator has a weak dependence on P arising from the additional

5 Conclusion

Judging from the numerical results in the previous section, the QI approach
for computing kinetic isotope eﬀects is very promising. The procedure is quite
general: multi-dimensional estimators for all relevant quantities are presented in
Refs. [12, 13]. Although the path-integral approach has been chosen because of
its favorable scaling with the number of degrees of freedom, the computations for
many-dimensional systems are still diﬃcult.

One obstacle is the diﬃculty of eﬃcient sampling of a many-dimensional conﬁg-
uration space. With proper estimators, we may decrease statistical and systematic
discretization errors, but it is diﬃcult to avoid systematic errors due to long corre-
lations. For this reason, it may be eﬃcient to use a diﬀerent number of imaginary
time slices [26] for diﬀerent degrees of freedom, which is a generalization of more
crude mixed quantum-classical methods.

Another obstacle to obtaining a good match between theory and experiment
is the potential energy surface for the reaction. While more accurate ab initio
potentials are computationally very expensive, the much faster molecular-mechanics
force ﬁelds are often too crude. In Ref. [13], in which the QI method is used to
compute the KIE for the isomerization of cis-pentadiene, two approaches are taken:
in one, an empirical valence bond (EVB) potential is formed from the equilibrium
potentials for reactants and products; in the other, a more accurate but also a more-
expensive semi-empirical potential is used. Because of the computational expense
already for this system with 39 degrees of freedom, it appear that due to their
better accuracy such semi-empirical potentials will be the potentials of choice for
intermediate-size systems, and the EVB potentials based on molecular-mechanical
force ﬁelds the potentials of choice for truly many-dimensional systems.

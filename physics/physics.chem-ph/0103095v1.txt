Abstract

We present a variational basis-set calculational scheme for elastic scat-

tering of positronium atom by helium atom in S wave and apply it to the

calculation of the scattering length. Highly correlated trial functions with ap-

propriate symmetry are used in this calculation. We report numerical result

for the scattering length in atomic unit: (1.0

0.1)a0. This corresponds to a

zero-energy elastic cross section of (4.0

I. INTRODUCTION

Recent successful measurements of ortho positronium (Ps) scattering cross sections by

H2, N2, He, Ne, Ar, C4H10, and C5H12 [1–7] have spurred renewed theoretical activity in this

subject [8–13]. Of these, the Ps-He system is of special interest as it is the simplest system

in which there are experimental results for total cross section [2–4] and pickoﬀ quenching

rate [5,14]. The experimental results for partial and diﬀerential cross sections for this system

should be available soon [1]. A complete understanding of this system is necessary before a

venture to more complex targets.

The pioneering calculations in this system using the static exchange approximation were

performed by Barker and Bransden [15,16] and by Fraser and Kraidy [17,18]. There have

also been R-matrix [8], close-coupling (CC) [11,12] and model-potential [19] calculations for

Ps-He scattering. More recently, there has been successful calculation of Ps scattering by H

[20], He [21–23], Ne [23], Ar [23], and H2 [24] using a regularized model exchange potential

in a coupled-channel formulation.

However, there is considerable discrepancy among the diﬀerent theoretical Ps-He cross

sections at zero energy which we discuss below. The static-exchange calculation by Sarkar

and Ghosh [11], and by Blackwood et al. [8] yielded 14.38πa2

0 (at 0.068 eV), and 14.58πa2
0

(at 0 eV), respectively, for the elastic cross section. The inclusion of more states of Ps in

the CC [12] and R-matrix [8] calculations does not change these results substantially. The

pioneering static-exchange calculations by Barker and Bransden [15] yielded 13.04 πa2

0 and

by Fraser [16] yielded 14.2πa2

0 for zero-energy Ps-He cross section. These results are in good

agreement with each other. However, the model potential calculation by Drachman and

Houston [19] yielded 7.73πa2

0 and by this author [22] yielded 3.34πa2

0 for the zero-energy Ps-

He cross section. So there is considerable discrepancy in the results of diﬀerent theoretical

calculation of low-energy Ps-He elastic scattering.

On the experimental front, there have been conﬂicting results for the low-energy Ps-He

elastic cross section by Nagashima et al. [4], who measured a cross section of (13

4)πa2
0

±

2

at 0.15 eV, by Coleman et al. [6], who reported 9πa2

0 at 0 eV, by Canter et al. [5], who

found 8.47πa2

0 at 0 eV, and by Skalsey et al. [3], who measured (2.6

0.5)πa2

0 at 0.9 eV. It

±

is unlikely that these ﬁndings could be consistent with each other.

The results for the total cross section of Ps scattering obtained from the coupled-channel

calculation employing the model potential [21–23] are in agreement with experiments of Refs.

[1–3] at low energies. For Ps-He, this model, while agrees [21–23] with the experimental

total cross sections [1,3] in the energy range 0 to 70 eV, reproduces [25] successfully the

experimental pickoﬀ quenching rate [5,14]. All other calculations could not reproduce the

general trend of cross sections of Ps-He scattering in the energy range 0 to 70 eV and

yielded a much too small quenching rate at thermal energies [15,17,25]. However, the very

low-energy elastic cross sections of the model-potential calculation [21–23] are at variance

with the experiments of Refs. [4–6].

Pointing at the discrepancy above among diﬀerent theoretical and experimental studies,

Blackwood et al. [8] called for a “fully ﬂedged calculation” to resolve the situation. Here

we present a variational basis-set calculational scheme for low-energy Ps-He scattering in

S wave below the lowest Ps-excitation threshold at 5.1 eV. Using this method we report

numerical result for the scattering length of Ps-He using a one parameter uncorrelated He

ground-state wave function [26].

We present the formulation for the variational basis-set calculation in Sec. II, the nu-

merical result for Ps-He scattering length in Sec. III and a summary in Sec. IV.

II. FORMULATION

Because of the existence of three identical fermions (electrons) in the Ps-He system, one

needs to antisymmetrize the full wave function. The position vectors of the electrons

r1

−

of Ps, and r2 and r3 of He

and positron (x) measured with respect to (w.r.t.) the massive

−

alpha particle at the origin are shown in Fig. 1. In this conﬁguration the wave function for

elastic scattering in the electronic doublet state of Ps-He is taken as

3

ψ1

k(1, 2, 3) = φ(2, 3)η(1)Fk(1, 2, 3)χ(1, 2, 3)

where k is the incident Ps momentum and

χ(1, 2, 3) = α(1)

[α(2)β(3)

β(2)α(3)],

1
√2

×

−

represents the doublet wave function of Ps-He and where α denotes spin up state and β down

and η(1) denotes the Ps wave function of electron 1. The He ground state wave function

φ(2, 3) and the scattering function Fk(1, 2, 3) are symmetric under the exchange of electrons

2 and 3. The spin function χ(1, 2, 3) is antisymmetric under the same exchange. The full

antisymmetrization operator for the three electrons is (1

P12 −

−

P13)(1

P23) where Pij

−

is an operator for exchange in both space and spin of electrons i and j. As the scattering

wave function (1) above is already antisymmetrized with respect to electrons 2 and 3, the

operator (1

P23) in the antisymmetrizer is redundant and the relevant antisymmetrizer in

P13). Hence, the fully antisymmetric state ψA

The full Ps-He Hamiltonian H can be broken in the convenient form as follows: H =

H1 + V1 where H1 includes the full kinetic energy and intracluster interaction of He and

Ps for the arrangement shown in Fig. 1 and V1 is the sum of the intercluster interaction

Eqs. (12) and (13) are also valid in partial-wave form.

In the present S-wave calculation, the basis functions are taken in the following form

fm(r2, r3, ρ1, s1) = ϕ(r3)gm(r2, ρ1, s1),

gm(r2, ρ1, s1) = ϕ(r2)η(ρ1)e−δmr2−αmρ1−βms1−γm(ρ2+r12)−µm(x+r1) sin(ks1)

,

ks1

where δm, αm, βm, γm, and µm are nonlinear variational parameters. The ground-state wave

function of the He atom is taken to be φ(r2, r3) = ϕ(r2)ϕ(r3) with ϕ(r) = λ3/2 exp(

λr)/√π

−

and λ = 1.6875 [26] and η(ρ) = exp(

0.5ρ)/√8π represent the Ps(1s) wave function. For

−

elastic scattering the direct Born amplitude is zero and the exchange correlation dominates

scattering. To be consistent with this, the direct terms in the form factors

i
are zero with the above choice of correlations in the basis functions via

h

fm|A1V1|

k

and

φ1
k

h

|A1V1|

fni

γm and µm. This property follows as the above function is invariant w.r.t. the interchange

of x and r1 whereas the remaining part of the integrand in the direct terms changes sign

under this transformation.

In Ps-He elastic scattering the electron 2 of He is the active

electron undergoing exchange with the electron 1 of Ps whereas the electron 3 of He is a

passive spectator. In this calculation we include in Eq. (15) correlation between electrons

6

1 and 2. Consequently, we deal with integrals in three vector variables – r1, r2 and x. If we

also include correlation involving electron 3 we shall have to deal with integration in four

vector variables, which is beyond the scope of the present study. However, we believe that a

meaningful calculation can be performed only with correlation between the active electrons

1 and 2. Hence, to avoid complication we ignore correlation involving electron 3, which is

expected to lead to correction over the present study.

III. NUMERICAL RESULT

We tested the convergence of the integrals by varying the number of integration points

in the x, s1 and s2 integrals in Eqs. (28) and (30) and the u integral in Eq. (29). The

x integration was relatively easy and 20 Gauss-Legendre quadrature points appropriately

distributed between 0 and 16 were enough for convergence. In the evaluation of integrals

of type (29) 40 Gauss-Legendre quadrature points were suﬃcient for adequate convergence.

The convergence in the numerical integration over s1 and s2 was achieved with 300 Gauss-

Legendre quadrature points between 0 and 12. The maximum value of l in the sum in Eqs.

(28) and (30), L, is taken to be 7 which is suﬃcient for obtaining the convergence with the

partial-wave expansions (23)

(27).

−

We ﬁnd that a judicial choice of the parameters in Eq. (15) is needed for convergence.

The present method does not provide a bound on the result. Consequently, the method

could lead to a wrong scattering length if an inappropriate (incomplete) basis set is chosen.

After some experimentation we ﬁnd that for good convergence the nonlinear parameters

δn and αn should be taken to have both positive and negative values and βn should have

9

progressively increasing values till about 1.5. If no care is taken in choosing the parame-

ters a large number of functions could be necessary for obtaining convergence. The results

In Table I we show the convergence pattern of the present calculation w.r.t. the number of

partial waves L and basis functions N used in the calculation. The convergence is satisfactory

considering that we are dealing with a complicated ﬁve-body problem. However, as the

present calculation does not produce a bound on the result, the convergence is not monotonic

10

with increasing N. The ﬁnal result of the present calculation is that for N = 14 and L = 7:

a = 1.02 au. Although it is diﬃcult to provide a quantitative measure of convergence, from

the ﬂuctuation of this result for large N and L we believe the error in our result to be less

than 10%, so that the ﬁnal Ps-He scattering length is taken as a = (1.0

0.1) au. The

±

results for large N and L reported in Table I all lie in this domain.

The maximum number of functions (N = 14) used in this calculation is also pretty

small, compared to those used in diﬀerent Kohn-type variational calculations for electron-

hydrogen (N = 56) [30], positron-hydrogen (N

286) [31], and positron-helium (N

[32] scattering. Because of the explicit appearance of the Green’s function, the present

basis-set approach is similar to the Schwinger variational method. Using the Schwinger

method, convergent results for electron-hydrogen [33] and positron-hydrogen [34] scattering

have been obtained with a relatively small basis set (N

10). These suggest a more rapid

∼

convergence in these problems with a Schwinger-type method.

IV. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION

To summarize, we have formulated a basis-set calculational scheme for S-wave Ps-He

elastic scattering below the lowest inelastic threshold using a variational expression for the

transition matrix. We illustrate the method numerically by calculating the scattering length

in the electronic doublet state: a = (1.0

0.1) au. This corresponds to a zero-energy

cross section of (4.0

0.8)πa2

0 in reasonable agreement with a model calculation by this

author (3.34πa2

[(2.6

±

This calculation as well as our previous studies of Ps-He scattering using a model exchange

potential [21,23] possibly consolidate the experimental result of Skalsey et al. However, these

low-energy Ps-He elastic scattering cross sections are in disagreement with other experiments

by Nagashima et al.

As the eﬀective interaction for elastic scattering between Ps and He is repulsive in nature,

a smaller scattering length as obtained in this study and in Refs. [21,22] would imply a weaker

eﬀective Ps-He interaction. This would allow the Ps atom to come closer to He and would

lead [25] to a large pickoﬀ quenching rate and a large 1Zeﬀ (
experiment [5,14]. The conventional close-coupling [12], R-matrix [8] and static-exchange

∼

[11,15–17] models yielded a much too large scattering length corresponding to a stronger

repulsion between Ps and He. Consequently, these models led to a much too small 1Zeﬀ
0.04) [15–17,25] in disagreement with experiment [5,14]. This is addressed in detail in
(

∼
Ref. [25] where we established a correlation between the diﬀerent scattering lengths and the

corresponding 1Zeﬀ. This correlation suggests that a small Ps-He scattering length as in
this work is consistent with the large experimental 1Zeﬀ.

Although we have used a simple wave function for He in this complex ﬁve-body calcula-

tion we do not believe that the use of a more reﬁned He wave function would substantially

change our ﬁndings and conclusions. However, independent calculations and accurate ex-

periments at low energies are welcome for a satisfactory resolution of this controversy.

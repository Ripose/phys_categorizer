(Dated: February 2, 2008)

The quasi-independent curvilinear coordinate approximation (QUICCA) method [K. N´emeth and
M. Challacombe, J. Chem. Phys. 121, 2877, (2004)] is extended to the optimization of crystal
structures. We demonstrate that QUICCA is valid under periodic boundary conditions, enabling
simultaneous relaxation of the lattice and atomic coordinates, as illustrated by tight optimization of
polyethylene, hexagonal boron-nitride, a (10,0) carbon-nanotube, hexagonal ice, quartz and sulfur
at the Γ-point RPBE/STO-3G level of theory.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Internal coordinates, involving bond stretches, angle
bends, torsions and out of plane bends, etc. are now rou-
tinely used in the optimization of molecular structures
by most standard quantum chemistry programs. Inter-
nal coordinates are advantageous for geometry optimiza-
tion as they exhibit a reduced harmonic and anharmonic
vibrational coupling1,2,3,4. This eﬀect allows for larger
steps during optimization, reducing the number of steps
by 7-10 times for small to medium sized molecules, rela-
tive to Cartesian conjugate gradient schemes5.

Recently, Kudin, Scuseria and Schlegel (KSS)6 and
Andzelm, King-Smith and Fitzgerald (AKF)7 reported
the ﬁrst crystal structure optimizations using internal
coordinates. These authors proposed new ways of build-
ing Wilson’s B matrix8 under periodic boundary con-
ditions. The B-matrix (and its higher order gener-
alizations), deﬁnes the transformation between energy
derivatives in Cartesian coordinates and those in internal
coordinates8,9. The scheme presented by KSS allows the
simultaneous relaxation of atomic positions and lattice
parameters, while the method developed by AKF allows
relaxation of atomic positions with a ﬁxed lattice.

More recently still, Buˇcko, Hafner and ´Angy´an (BHA)5
presented a more “democratic” formulation of Wilson’s B
matrix for crystals, realizing that changes in periodic in-
ternal coordinates may have non-vanishing contributions
to the lattice. The BHA deﬁnition of the B-matrix will
be used throughout this paper.

In the present article, we extend our recently developed
optimization algorithm, the Quasi Independent Curvilin-
ear Coordinate Approach (QUICCA)10 to the condensed
phase. QUICCA is based on the idea that optimization
can be carried out in an uncoupled internal coordinate
representation, with coupling eﬀects accounted for im-
plicitly through a weighted ﬁt. So far, QUICCA has
been simple to implement, robust and eﬃcient for iso-
lated molecules, with a computational cost that scales
linearly with system size. However, nothing is yet known
about the applicability of QUICCA for crystals. In crys-
tals, coupling may be very diﬀerent from that encoun-

tered in isolated molecules, and there may be signiﬁcant
eﬀects from changes in the lattice. If QUICCA also works
well for crystals, then it presents a viable oﬀshoot of gra-
dient only algorithms for the large scale optimization of
atomistic systems.

In the following, we ﬁrst review the construction of
Wilson’s B matrix for crystals (Sec. II A), and then in
Sec. III we go over the QUICCA algorithm and discuss
its implementation for periodic systems. In Sec. IV, re-
sults of test calculations ranging over a broad class of
crystalline systems are presented. We discuss these re-
sults in Sec. V, and then go on to present our conclusions
in Sec. VI.

II. METHODOLOGY

A. Wilson’s B matrix for crystals

In this section we brieﬂy review the BHA approach to
construction of the periodic B-matrix, with a somewhat
simpliﬁed notation. A more detailed discussion can be
found in Ref. [5] and a background gained from Wilson’s
book, Ref. [8].

The independent geometrical variables of a crystal are
the fractional coordinates ~fk, and the lattice vectors ~hl.
The absolute Cartesian position of the k-th atom, ~rk, is
related to the corresponding fractional coordinates by

~rk = h ~fk,

(1)

where h = {~h1 : ~h2 : ~h3} is the matrix of (coloumn wise)
Cartesian lattice vectors.

The periodic B-matrix is naturally coloumn blocked,
with a fractional coordinate block Bf
Ni×3Na, and a lat-
tice coordinate block Bh
Ni×9. The full B-matrix is then
B = (cid:0)
(cid:1), a Ni × (3Na + 9) matrix with Ni the
number of internal coordinates and Na the number of
atoms. Elements of Bf involve total derivatives of inter-
nal coordinates with respect to fractionals,

Bf : Bh

~bik =

dφi
d ~fk

,

k = 1, Na ,

(2)

where φi is the i-th internal coordinate and the B-matrix
elements are atom-blocked as the three-vector ~bik. Only
the atoms k that determine internal coordinate i are non-
zero, making Bf extremely sparse. Conventional ele-
ments of Wilson’s B-matrix, ∂φi
∂~rk , are related to these
total derivatives by the chain rule:

~bik =

dφi
d ~fk

=

∂φi
∂~rk

h.

(3)

Likewise, elements of Bh are

~bil =

dφi
dhl

= X
m∈ni

∂φi
∂~rm

fml,

l = 1, 3

(4)

where fml is the l-th component of the fractional coordi-
nate corresponding to atom m, and the summation goes
over the set ni of all atoms that determine φi, i.e.
in
case of torsions and out of plane bendings, there are four
atoms in this set. From Eq. (4), it is clear that change in
the lattice has the potential to change each internal co-
ordinate, through the fractionals and depending on sym-
metry, so that in general we can expect Bh to be dense.
Also, note that fml can be greater then 1 if atom m is
not in the central cell.

B.

Internal Coordinate Transformations

With the B-matrix properly deﬁned, transformation
of Cartesian coordinates, lattice vectors and their corre-
sponding gradients into internal coordinates remains. As
in the case of the B-matrix, the Cartesian gradients are
partitioned into a fractional component,

~g f
k =

dE
d ~fk

=

∂E
∂~rk

h,

k = 1, Na ,

(5)

and a lattice component, ~gh, with 9 entries involving the
total derivatives dE
; the emphasis underscores the fact
d~hl
that some programs produce partial derivatives with re-
spect to lattice vectors, and this subtly must be taken
into account (e.g. see Eq. (9) in Ref. [5]).

With this blocking structure, gradients in internal co-

ordinates are then deﬁned implicitly by the equation

~g i

Bf : Bh
(cid:0)

(cid:1) = (cid:0)~g f : ~g h

(cid:1) ,

(6)

which may be solved in linear scaling CPU time, through
Cholesky factorization of the matrix BtB that enters
the left-handed pseudo-inverse, followed by forward and
backward substitution, as described in Ref. [11]. Lin-
ear scaling factorization of BtB may be achieved, as
the upper left-hand 3Na × 3Na block is hyper-sparse,
leading also to a hyper-sparse elimination tree and
sparse Cholesky factors, similar to the case of isolated
molecules11. Note however that the factorization of
BBt, involved in construction of a right-handed pseudo-
inverse, has the dense 9 × Ni row uppermost and the

2

dense Ni×9 coloumn foremost, leading to dense Cholesky
factors. Thus, the left- and right-handed approach are
not equivalent for internal coordinate transformations of
large crystal systems, as they are in the case of gas phase
molecules, when using sparse linear algebra to achieve a
reduced computational cost.

Once predictions are made for improved values of in-
ternal coordinates, based on the internal coordinates and
their gradients, new Cartesian coordinates are calcu-
lated via an iterative back-transformation as described in
Ref. [10], which also scales linearly with the system-size.
At each step of the iterative back-transformation, frac-
tional coordinates and lattice vectors are updated and
the corresponding atomic Cartesian coordinates are com-
puted. From these, updated values of the internal coordi-
nates are found, and the next iteration is started. Besides
these minor details, the back-transformation is the same
as that used for isolated molecules.

drogen bond coordinate in hexagonal ice, starting from the
crystal structure12. Numbers label QUICCA optimization
steps, and the star shows the predicted minimum given by
a weighted line ﬁt (dashed line) of the previous 6 points.

A. The QUICCA algorithm for crystals

Details of the QUasi-Independent Curvilinear Coordi-
nate Approximation (QUICCA) for geometry optimiza-
tion of isolated molecules have been given in Ref. [10].
Here we provide a brief overview of the method.

QUICCA is based on the trends shown by internal co-
ordinate gradients during geometry optimization. See
Fig. 1 for example. These trends can be exploited by
a weighted curve ﬁt for each internal coordinate gradi-
ent, allowing an independent, one-dimensional extrapo-

lation to zero. The predicted minima for each internal
coordinate collectively determines one optimization step.
This method works surprisingly well, but only when the
weights are chosen to account for coupling eﬀects; when
coupling is strong, the weights should be small and vica
versa. Also, the ﬁtting process has an important averag-
ing eﬀect on coupling that contributes to the success of
QUICCA.

The only diﬀerence in our current implementation of
QUICCA, relative to that described in Ref. [10], is that
merging the connectivities from recent optimization steps
is no longer carried out. Omitting this connectivity
merger does not change the results for Baker’s test suite
as given in Ref. [10], and does not appear to diminish the
overall eﬀectiveness of QUICCA.

B. The periodic internal coordinate system

In setting up a periodic internal coordinate system, it
is ﬁrst important to consider the situation where, during
optimization, atoms wrapping across cell boundaries lead
to large (unphysical) jumps in bond lengths, angles, etc.
This situation is avoided here by employing a minimum
image criterion to generate a set of Cartesian coordinates
consistent with a ﬁxed reference geometry.

Also, because internal coordinates span cell bound-
aries, it is convenient to work with a 3 × 3 × 3 supercell,
including the central cell surrounded by its 27 nearest
neighbors. Even though a smaller replica of 8 cells, with
lattice indices between 0 and 1 contains all necessary lo-
cal internal coordinates, we prefer to employ the larger
supercell, to avoid fragmentation of bonds etc at the cell
boundaries. Then, all internal coordinates are identiﬁed
in the supercell by means of a recognition algorithm, just
as for isolated molecules. Finally, internal coordinates
are discarded that do not involve at least one atom in
the central cell.

This procedure produces symmetry equivalent inter-
nal coordinates, among those internal coordinates that
cross cell boundaries.
In the present implementation
these equivalent coordinates are not ﬁltered out, since
their presence has no major eﬀect on the optimization;
the equivalent coordinates result in exactly the same line
ﬁt and same predicted minima.

It is worth noting that an appropriate internal coor-
dinate recognition scheme is extremely important to the
success of internal coordinate optimization. Here, we are
using a still experimental algorithm, which we hope to
describe in a forthcoming paper.

C. Treatment of constraints

In the treatment of constraints, we distinguish between
soft and hard constraints. Soft constraints approach their
target value as the optimization proceeds, reaching it at
convergence. Most internal coordinate constraints are of

3

the soft type in our implementation. The application of
soft constraints is particularly useful in situations where
it is diﬃcult to construct corresponding Cartesian coor-
dinates that satisfy the constrained values. Hard con-
straints are set to their required value at the beginning
and keep their value during the optimization. Cartesian
and lattice constraints are hard constraints in the current
implementation.

Our method of treating hard constraints is similar to
Baker’s projection scheme13; columns of the B-matrix
corresponding to hard constraints are simply zeroed.
This zeroing reﬂects the simple fact that a constrained
Cartesian coordinate or lattice parameter may not vary
any internal coordinate. Note, that if the lattice parame-
ters a, b, c, α, β and γ are constrained, Bh must be trans-
formed from a lattice-vector representation into a lattice-
parameter representation by using the generalized inverse
of the lattice-parameter Jacobian. This transformation
results in 6 columns corresponding to the 6 lattice param-
eters. After zeroing the relevant columns, this portion
of the Bh matrix is transformed back into the original
Ni × 9 representation. In addition, this approach guar-
antees that during the iterative back-transformation no
displacements occur for constrained coordinates or pa-
rameters.

In both cases,

it is necessary to project out the
constraint-space component of the Cartesian gradients,
so that the internal coordinate gradients remain consis-
tent with the constrained internal coordinates. As recom-
mended by Pulay4, this is accomplished via projection;

~g ′ = P~g ,

(7)

where P is the puriﬁcation projector that ﬁlters out the
constraint-space. For Cartesian variables, this together
the aforementioned zeroing of Bf is suﬃcient to enforce a
hard constraint. For constrained internal coordinate vari-
ables though, this projection is not entirely suﬃcient, as
there are further contaminants that can arise in the left-
handed pseudo-inverse transformation to internal coor-
dinates. These contaminants can be rigorously removed
by introducing a further projection in the transformation
step, as suggested by Baker13. However, toward conver-
gence these contaminants disappear, and in practice, we
ﬁnd good performance without introducing an additional
puriﬁcation step. And so, Eq. (7) is the only puriﬁcation
used in the current implementation, for both hard and
soft constraints.

While puriﬁcation of the gradients is suﬃcient for the
already satisﬁed hard constraints, the soft internal co-
ordinate constraints must be imposed at each geome-
try step. This is accomplished through setting the con-
strained and optimized internal coordinates, followed by
iterative back transformation to Cartesian coordinates.
This procedure ﬁnds a closest ﬁt that satisﬁes the modi-
ﬁed internal coordinate system, as described in Refs. [4]
and [11,14].

D.

Implementation

Crystal QUICCA has been implemented in the Mon-
doSCF suite of linear scaling quantum chemistry codes15,
using FORTRAN-95 and sparse (non-atom-blocked) lin-
ear algebra. Total energies are computed using existing
fast methods (TRS416, ONX17, QCTC and HiCu18), and
the corresponding lattice forces (total derivatives) are
calculated analytically, with related methods that will
be described eventually. Full linear scaling algorithms
have been used throughout.

These linear scaling algorithms deliver Γ-point ener-
gies and forces only. For the Hartree-Fock (HF) model,
this corresponds to the minimum image criterion (HF-
MIC)17. For small unit cells, these Γ-point eﬀects typ-
ically lead to diﬀerent values for symmetry equivalent
bond and lattice parameters. These eﬀects decay rapidly
with system size, and are typically less severe for pure
DFT than for HF-MIC.

While not always the most eﬃcient option, backtrack-
ing has been used in all calculations. Backtracking pro-
ceeds by reducing the steplength by halves, for up to
three cycles. After that, QUICCA accepts the higher
energy and carries on.

In all calculations, the TIGHT numerical thresholding
scheme17 has been used, targeting a relative error of 1D-8
in the total energy and an absolute error of 1D-4 in the
forces. A single convergence criterion is used. That cri-
terion is that the maximum magnitude of both atomic
and lattice vector gradients is less than 5D-4 au at con-
vergence.

Atomic units are used throughout.

We have developed a periodic test suite in the spirit
of Baker’s gas phase set19.
The periodic test set
includes 6 diﬀerent systems: Polyethylene, hexago-
nal boron-nitride, a (10,0)carbon-nanotube, hexagonal
ice12, quartz20 and sulfur21. Most of these structures
were taken either from the Inorganic Crystal Structures
Database (ICSD)22 or from Cambridge Crystallographic
Data Center23 and the translationally unique positions
generated with Mercury24. Details of the geometries used
are given in Appendix A.

Full, simultaneous relaxation of both the lattice and
atomic positions have been carried out by means of crys-
tal QUICCA, described above, in the Γ-point approxi-
mation at the RPBE/STO-3G level of theory.

Table I shows the number of optimization steps and
the optimal energy for each system. While the ﬁrst four
test systems converged quickly, quartz and sulfur took
substantially longer to reach the optimum. In the case of
quartz, there is a very large (unphysical) deformation,
wherein four membered rings are formed during opti-
mization, due perhaps to a combination of a minimal
basis and Γ-point eﬀects. The optimized structure of
quartz is shown in Fig. 2. In the sulfur crystal, S8 rings
interact via a Van der Waals like interaction, which has
a very ﬂat potential, making this a challenging test case.

tal optimization by several groups. Kudin, Scuseria and
Schlegel6 implemented an early internal coordinate opti-
mization scheme in the GAUSSIAN programs, and ap-
plied it to the optimization of RPBE/3-21G urea with
internal coordinate constraints. At about the same time,
Civalleri et. al25 implemented a Cartesian conjugate gra-
dient scheme in the CRYSTAL program, and carried out
careful studies examining the eﬀects of k-space sampling
and integral tolerances on ﬁxed lattice optimization of
RHF/STO-3G urea.

Here, we make direct contact with these works, Refs.[6,
25]. However, because the linear scaling methods used
by MondoSCF are Γ-point only, we employ a 2 × 2 × 2
supercell, so that we may make approximate numerical
comparison with the k-space methods. This 2 × 2 × 2
supercell involves 16 urea molecules, C1 (no) symmetry,
128 atoms in total, and more than 850 redundant inter-
nal coordinates; the number of internal coordinates used

by QUICCA ﬂuctuates slightly during optimization. For
comparison, the work of Civalleri et. al25 makes use of
P ¯421m symmetry, involving just 8 variables in the ﬁxed
lattice optimization of urea. In their relaxation of urea,
Kudin, Scuseria and Schlegel6 employed a 4 molecule cell
with S4 symmetry, with optimization of the lattice and
atomic centers, but all dihedral angles constrained, in-
volving 204 redundant internal coordinates.

Convergence of the RPBE/3-21G MondoSCF calcu-
lations are shown in Fig. 9, in which a full relaxation of
lattice and atomic centers has been performed, together
with the energy diﬀerence from Ref. [6]. The GAUS-
SIAN values for this calculation, involving constrained
dihedrals, are -447.6501595 and -447.6632120 for the
beginning and ending values of the total energy. These
(and subsequent) values have been normalized to total
energy per 2 urea molecules. The corresponding Mon-
doSCF values are -447.648312 and -447.661578. The

doSCF, they are -442.069473 and -442.084671. The
energy diﬀerences are -.01523 and -.01520 for CRYS-
TAL and MondoSCF, respectively. The CRYSTAL
optimization converged in 15 steps, while QUICCA took
19 steps.

V. DISCUSSION

Overall, the behavior of QUICCA for crystal systems
is similar to that of gas phase systems. For a well be-
haved system like ice, convergence is rapid and mono-
tone. For systems undergoing large rearrangements, such
as the quartz system, QUICCA takes many more steps,
but still maintains monotone convergence. For both ill-
conditioned (ﬂoppy) gas phase and crystal systems, such
as sulfur, convergence is slower, with steps that some-
times raise the energy, even with 3-step backtracking.

Large amplitude motions can lead to rapid changes in
curvature of the potential energy surface. In this case,
the QUICCA algorithm may oﬀer advantages relative to
strategies based on BFGS-like updates, which are history
laden. This is because QUICCA employs a weighting

scheme that takes large moves into account and that can
identify recently introduced trends in just a few steps.

The problems encountered with ﬂoppy systems are by
no means unique to QUICCA, but plague most gradient
only internal coordinate schemes. Also, as with other
schemes, we have found the performance of QUICCA to
be sensitive to the quality of the internal coordinate sys-
tem. It is our opinion that the diﬃculties encountered
with many ﬂoppy systems could be overcome with a bet-
ter choice of internal coordinate system.

For ﬂoppy systems, the ability to resolve small energy
diﬀerences with limited precision (due to linear scaling
algorithms) can also be problematic. In particular, with
the TIGHT option, MondoSCF tries to deliver a relative
precision of 8 digits in the total energy, and 4 digits of
absolute precision in forces. For sulfur, achieving atomic
forces below 5D-4 corresponds to an energy diﬀerence
of 1D-5, demanding a relative precision in the total en-
ergy of 1D-10. Exceeding the limits of the TIGHT energy
threshold can be seen clearly in Fig. 5, wherein the en-
ergy has jumps below 1D-4. The observant reader will
also notice that the 21st data point is missing from Fig. 9.
This data point was removed because it was 1D-4 below
the converged value of the total energy, -3581.2926, con-
fusing the log-linear plot. These ﬂuctuations are at the
targeted energy resolution, and are likely due to changes
in the adaptive HiCu grid for numerical integration of the
exchange-correlation17. Nevertheless, reliable structural
information can still be obtained, as absolute precision
in the forces is retained with increasing system size, al-
lowing gradient following algorithms such as QUICCA to
still ﬁnd a geometry which satisﬁes the force convergence
criteria.

For the urea calculations, very good agreement was
found between the MondoSCF calculations and the
CRYSTAL results, in accordance with our previous ex-
perience for both pure DFT17 and RHF-MIC models18.
Slightly less satisfactory agreement was found between
the MondoSCF and GAUSSIAN calculations, which
was probably due to the diﬀerences in constraint. In both
cases, the QUICCA calculations took more steps; 4 more
than CRYSTAL, and 11 more than GAUSSIAN. It
should be pointed out though, that the MondoSCF cal-
culations involved a substantially more complicated po-
tential energy surface: Firstly, the Γ-point surface lacks
the symmetry provided by k-space sampling. Secondly,
the 2 × 2 × 2 calculation has many more degrees of free-
dom, and in particular, lower frequency modes due to the
larger cell.

VI. CONCLUSIONS

We have implemented the Buˇcko, Hafner and ´Angy´an5
deﬁnition of periodic internal coordinates in conjunction
with the QUICCA algorithm, and demonstrated eﬃcient,
full relaxation of systems with one, two and three di-
In general, we have found that
mensional periodicity.
QUICCA performs with an eﬃciency comparable to that
of similarly posed gas phase problems, and speculate that
further enhancement may be achieved through an im-
proved choice of internal coordinates.

We have argued that linear scaling internal coordi-
nate transformations for crystal systems can be achieved
with a left-handed pseudo-inverse, as the dense rows and
columns of the periodic BtB matrix determine just the
last few pivots of the corresponding Cholesky factor.

We have carried out supercell calculations using a full
compliment of linear scaling algorithms, including sparse
linear algebra, fast force and matrix builds and found
good agreement with k-space methods, involving a mod-
est number of optimization cycles. Thus, in addition to
further demonstrating the stability of our linear scaling
algorithms, we have established QUICCA as a reliable
tool for large scale optimization problems in the con-
densed phase.

In conclusion, QUICCA is a new gradient only ap-
proach to internal coordinate optimization that is robust
and generally applicable, both to gas-phase molecules
and systems of one, two and three dimensional periodic-
ity. It allows for ﬂexible optimization protocols, involv-
ing simultaneous relaxation of lattice and atom centers,
constrained lattice with relaxation of atom centers, con-
strained atom centers with optimization of the lattice,
admixtures of the above with constrained internal coor-
dinates, etc. QUICCA is conceptually simple and easy
to implement. Perhaps most importantly though, it is a
new approach to gradient only internal coordinate opti-
mization, oﬀering a number of opportunities for further
development.

Ice Hexagonal ice is the most important natural
occurrence of ice. Its structure has been taken from the
literature12. Since the literature provides two equilibrium
position for each hydrogen atom, due to the tunneling of
hydrogens in ice, our starting structure is taken as the
average of these two positions for each hydrogen atom,
and is given in Table IV.

Abstract

Notwithstanding the long and distinguished history of studies of vibra-
tional energy relaxation, exactly how it is that high frequency vibrations man-
age to relax in a liquid remains somewhat of a mystery. Both experimental
and theoretical approaches seem to say that there is a natural frequency range
associated with intermolecular motion in liquids, typically spanning no more
than a few hundred cm−1. Landau–Teller–like theories explain rather easily
how a solvent can absorb any vibrational energy within this “band”, but how
is it that molecules can rid themselves of superﬂuous vibrational energies sig-
niﬁcantly in excess of these values? In this paper we develop a theory for such
processes based on the idea that the crucial liquid motions are those that most
rapidly modulate the force on the vibrating coordinate — and that by far the
most important of these motions are those involving what we have called the
mutual nearest neighbors of the vibrating solute. Speciﬁcally, we suggest that
whenever there is a single solvent molecule suﬃciently close to the solute that
the solvent and solute are each other’s nearest neighbors, then the instanta-
neous scattering dynamics of the solute–solvent pair alone suﬃces to explain
the high frequency relaxation. This highly reduced version of the dynam-
ics has implications for some of the previous theoretical formulations of this
problem. Previous instantaneous–normal–mode theories allowed us to under-
stand the origin of a band of liquid frequencies, and even had some success in
predicting relaxation within this band, but lacking a sensible picture of the
eﬀects of liquid anharmonicity on dynamics, were completely unable to treat
higher frequency relaxation. When instantaneous–normal–mode dynamics is
used to evaluate the instantaneous pair theory, though, we end up with a mul-
tiphonon picture of the relaxation which is in excellent agreement with the
exact high-frequency dynamics — suggesting that the critical anharmonicity
behind the relaxation is not in the complex, underlying liquid dynamics, but
in the relatively easy–to–understand nonlinear solute–solvent coupling. There
are implications, as well, for the Independent-Binary-Collision (IBC) theory
of vibrational relaxation in liquids. The success of the instantaneous–pair ap-
proach certainly provides a measure of justiﬁcation for the IBC model’s focus
on few–body dynamics. However, the pair theory neither needs nor supports
the basic IBC factoring of relaxation rates into many–body and few–body dy-
namical components — into collision rates and relaxation rates per collision.
Rather, our results favor taking an instantaneous perspective: the relaxation
rate is indeed exercise in few–body dynamics, but a diﬀerent exercise for each
instantaneous liquid conﬁguration. The many–body features therefore appear
only in the guise of a purely equilibrium problem, that of ﬁnding the liklihood
of particularly eﬀective solvent arrangements around the solute. All of these
results are tested numerically on model diatomic solutes dissolved in atomic
ﬂuids (including the experimentally and theoretically interesting case of I2
dissolved in Xe). The instantaneous pair theory leads to results in quantita-

2

tive agreement with those obtained from far more laborious exact molecular
dynamics simulations.

I. INTRODUCTION

The most crucial step in a solution–phase chemical reaction is almost always a thermal
activation; improbable as it may be, the solvent must ﬁnd some avenue for concentrating
enough of its kinetic energy within the vibrations of the reactants to allow the reaction to
proceed.1,2 A similar challenge can be posed later on in the process; the ability of the resulting
products to return any excess vibrational energy back to the solvent is often critical to the
outcome of the reaction.1,3 Beyond these issues however, there is a conceptual importance
to understanding such vibrational energy transfers that goes to the heart of how one thinks
about the dynamical role of a solvent. If the entire solvent-solute system is regarded as a
“super molecule” (as might be appropriate for solid-state vibrational relaxation), then the
question is how a V–V relaxation occurs — that is, which vibrations of the system as a
whole (which phonons) can serve as repositories for the solute’s vibrational energy.4–7 If, on
the other hand, we consider the solute to be buﬀeted by occasional collisions with individual
solvent molecules, a very natural perspective for the gas phase, what we need to understand
is a V–T process.8 So how is it that we should think about vibrational energy relaxation in
liquids?9–22

A formal answer to this question arises quite simply from a Fermi’s Golden Rule evalu-
ation of the relaxation rate.23 Within the apparently quite broad reach of low–order time–
dependent perturbation theory, the rate at which vibrational energy relaxes from a given
solute mode, T −1
, is proportional to the Fourier component of the autocorrelation function
of the force on that mode at the mode’s own frequency, ω0.24 For a diatomic molecule of
reduced mass µ, for example, the classical vibrational energy relaxation rate is predicted to
obey the Landau–Teller formula,14

solvent that would occur were the mode itself held motionless.

Leaving aside such issues as whether a purely classical treatment of the solvent can
adequately represent the inﬂuence on what is frequently a rather quantum mechanical vi-
bration,25 it seems clear that this approach can usually be counted on to give a numerically
accurate rendition of classical vibrational energy relaxation.13 More than that, though, it
provides a conceptually suggestive rendition because it ﬁts so nicely into the broader con-
text of relaxation in liquids. Within a Generalized Langevin representation of the problem,
the function η(t) can be interpreted as an approximation to the solvent-induced friction felt
by a vibrating coordinate — and since the exact friction can sometimes be determined by
simulation, it has been possible both to check and to understand the formalism’s accuracy.12

4

Still, the fact that numerical success does not necessarily translate into conceptual insight
becomes clear once we try to get at the central V–V vs. V–T dichotomy.
It has long
been appreciated that any frequency–domain friction ˆη(ω) can be regarded as having its
origin in the dynamics of a dense set of harmonic oscillators, oscillators whose frequencies
span the frequency range of the friction and which are coupled linearly to the coordinate
of interest.26,27 The fact that liquid frictions interpreted in this fashion typically have a
spectrum spanning a few hundred cm−1 could thus be taken as evidence that there is indeed
something resembling a phonon band of this width in liquids. It is then but a short step
to suggest that any vibrational relaxation of modes with frequencies lying within this band
ought to be considered as occuring via a resonant V–V transfer.

This argument is actually rather weak as it stands. These harmonic oscillators could,
in fact, be little more than mathematical constructs lacking any microscopic, molecular
foundation. What gives the argument a bit more substance is that recent work has shown
that it is possible to associate these oscillators with the instantaneous normal modes of the
solutions, oscillators which really are speciﬁc, well–deﬁned molecular motions.28–35 Indeed,
perhaps it is fair to say that the basic success of such instantaneous–normal–mode (INM)
approaches in predicting most of the essential behavior of the vibrational friction lends a
certain amount of credibility to what would otherwise be fanciful attempts to take liquid
phonon pictures literally in theories of vibrational relaxation.36

There is, however, a major problem and it is this problem that forms the topic of this
paper. Once the vibration to be relaxed lies outside the putative band of the liquid, any
theory with nothing but linear forces and harmonic oscillators will predict that energy relax-
ation is completely forbidden.37 Yet, what we might call the high frequency modes of solutes
(those with frequencies higher than the Debye frequency in the solid–state parlance) really
do relax, albeit very slowly.9,17,38 It is worth noting that the Landau–Teller formula itself
has no diﬃculty with this phenomenon; it simply ascribes the relaxation to the presence of
small but ﬁnite high–frequency Fourier components of the force autocorrelation function.14
The conceptual diﬃculty is that we have independent evidence about the intrinsic band-
width of intermolecular vibrations in a liquid, both from theoretical predictions, such as
instantaneous–normal–mode analysis39–41 and Fourier representations of simulated velocity
autocorrelation functions42 and from experimental results, such as those from far infrared,
Rayleigh and Optical Kerr eﬀect spectra.43,44 None of these estimates give any evidence that
the band for simple liquids extends signiﬁcantly beyond a few hundred cm−1. A much more
likely scenario than one that would require every simple liquid to have the kinds of 500–2000
cm−1 intermolecular vibrations necessary for simple V–V processes is that high frequency
vibrational energy relaxation is a strongly anharmonic event — and it is this anharmonicity
we need to understand.

Having made this point, though, there is an interesting distinction we can make. The
relaxation of impurity molecules in crystals can often be modeled as a multiphonon process,
one in which the essential harmonicity of the vibrations (and hence the very idea of phonons)
is respected, but in which the nonlinearity of the coupling forces allows for V-V transfer to
overtones of the crystal’s intrinsic frequencies.5–7,45,46 In systems as inherently anharmonic
as liquids, however, we could easily imagine that the basic idea of independent harmonic
excitations could be the ﬁrst casualty.47–49 Thus, without further work, it is far from clear
which of these two kinds of anharmonicity — the nonlinearity of the forces being driven

5

by the liquid’s dynamics or that of the actual dynamics itself — ought to be more critical
to high–frequency relaxation in liquids. In particular, we are still left with the question of
whether the V–V paradigm for resonant energy transfer is going to be any better than a
V–T based perspective would be.

Complicating this issue is the fact that there is some evidence on the side of molecular
translation being the primary sink for vibrational energy. That is, there is some support
for a collisional model for vibrational relaxation. While it is admittedly far from intuitive
how discrete, uncorrelated collisions could ever occur in a dense a medium as a liquid,
the so–called Isolated–Binary Collision (IBC) model50,51 has been remarkably successful in
rationalizing the thermodynamic state dependence of vibrational population relaxation rates
based on just such a picture.52,53,55 The notion behind this model is that these rates should
factor into a purely few–body scattering piece specifying the rate of energy transfer per
collision, and a liquid–state piece quantifying the rate at which the solvent collides with the
solute. The fact that the concept (and thus the rate) of collisions is ill–deﬁned in liquids is
certainly vexing,54–56 but it is hardly out of the question that some other, more sophisticated
analysis of the collision concept might ﬁnd that the V–T motif is still a dominant mechanism
for relaxation.

The approach we shall take in this paper to getting at these issues is to begin with
the standard perturbative (Landau–Teller) expression in terms of the force autocorrelation
function, Eqs.
(1.1)–(1.3), but then ask from precisely where we should expect the ma-
jor high frequency components of the correlation function to arise. For any instantaneous
conﬁguration of the liquid, this analysis will immediately lead us to look at the short–time
scattering dynamics of the solute and a single crucial solvent partner. Previous work on
vibrational relaxation has shown that whenever there is a solvent molecule that is nearer
to the solute than any other solvent molecule is to either member of the solute–solvent
pair — that is, whenever there is a mutual–nearest–neighbor solute–solvent pair — then
the high-frequency solvent eﬀects are dominated by the pair, at least within the liquid’s
band.31 We will show how this observation can be exploited more generally, transcending
the limitations to dynamics within the band. Not surprisingly, our theoretical prediction
for the relaxation rate will then separate into a straightforward few–body dynamical calcu-
lation and a residual many–body problem, just as with IBC theory. However, unlike the
IBC approach, the liquid–state portion of our theory will turn out to rest on a simple, well–
deﬁned, purely equilibrium question. Moreover, our development will make it clear how we
can make connections between this V–T theory and the harmonic instantaneous dynamics
of instantaneous–normal–modes, and thereby connect with the V–V energy transfer ideas
which seem to work so well within the solvent band.

The remainder of the paper will be organized as follows: Section II will present our
basic theory, an expression for the full force autocorrelation function of the system in terms
of a correlation function for single degree of freedom, one whose equations of motion we
proceed to derive. Section III then explores the connection to the instantaneous–normal–
mode perspective, showing how we can view the new theory as a natural generalization of
INM ideas. Section IV provides some numerical examples of how and how well the various
approaches work, and we conclude in Sec. V with some general comments on what we are
now in a position to say about the questions posed in this Introduction.

II. INSTANTANEOUS PAIR THEORY FOR THE VIBRATIONAL FRICTION

A. Solute–Solvent Coupling versus Solute–Solvent Dynamics

While the central quantity of interest in vibrational relaxation is the force autocorrelation
function of Eq. (1.3), it is convenient to look instead at a mathematically equivalent function,
the “force–velocity” autocorrelation function,57,58

The main reason we bother with this conversion is that this alternative version will suggest
a natural division within our problem. As one might have expected, there will always be
contributions from the relative solute–solvent velocities — the intrinsic dynamics of the prob-
lem — but there will be also be separate features dependent directly on the solute–solvent
distances — and it is these that will be most pertinent to the solute–solvent coupling.32
Indeed, one of the key aspects of our subsequent development will be the realization that
these two kinds of information actually play substantially diﬀerent roles in determining the
high–frequency behavior.

We can begin to see how this division occurs by looking at the problem of evaluating
a general correlation function of the form of Eq. (2.1) when F is any speciﬁcally solute-
centered quantity. That is, suppose we look at a correlation function of the form of Eq.
(2.1) with the function F given by a sum of solute-solvent pair “potentials”,

with the tagged solute labeled as particle 0, the remaining solvent denoted by j = 1, . . . , N
and the interparticle distances given by r0j ≡ |

(2.3)

(2.4)

This general function w(r), something we have referred to elsewhere as the “spectroscopic
probe potential”,32 could very well be the force on some portion of the solute (as it is in
vibrational relaxation), but for the purposes of this argument it could also be the change in
the solute-solvent potential energies when the solute is promoted from one electronic state
to another (the situation in time-dependent ﬂuorescence studies of solvation).40

If we substitute Eq. (2.4) into Eq. (2.1), we ﬁnd that the velocity form of the correlation

function consists of two kinds of terms,

GF (t) =

w′[r0j(t)] w′[r0j(0)] ˙r0j(t) ˙r0j(0)

(2.5)

a binary piece, the ﬁrst term, which considers only the dynamics caused by the motion
of a single solvent at a time, and a ternary piece, the second term, which involves the
simultaneous motion of two diﬀerent solvents.

These two parts will not contribute equally, for reasons we shall come to presently, but
the essential ingredients of the correlation function are already visible. When we evaluate
any of the terms at time t = 0,

w′[r0j(0)] w′[r0k(0)] ˙r0j(0) ˙r0k(0)

,

(2.6)

we notice that the contribution factors rigorously into a static part involving the coupling,
w′(r), and a dynamical part involving the velocity,
˙r. This separation suggests, though,
that this same conceptual distinction between coupling and dynamics ought to continue
to operate at short times — and therefore at high frequencies — despite the fact that
the expression no longer factors. But, once we make such a distinction, we can simplify
our expressions dramatically. For one thing, at the highest frequencies we should expect
coupling to be far more inﬂuential than dynamics in determining the correlation function.
With typical intermolecular potentials and forces, the sharply varying repulsive parts allow
for tremendous variation in the coupling (and therefore enormous values of w′(r)) just from
small changes in internuclear distances. The velocities, by contrast, never become all that
large in magnitude, guided as they are by the equilibrium Boltzmann distribution.

We can make this same point a bit more quantitatively. If we assume that the t = 0

factorization holds, at least roughly, then each term in GF (t) can be written

8

Tjk(t) =

w′[r0j(t)] w′[r0k(0)] ˙r0j(t) ˙r0k(0)

where ˆV (ω) and ˆC(ω) are the cosine transforms of the single–solvent velocity and coupling

(2.7)

Hence, we see again that the high–frequency dependence of our friction spectrum results
almost entirely from the high-frequency behavior of the coupling.

This argument can be taken still further. The dynamic range of the coupling is so large
that we might expect it to be dominated by the very largest contributions. No more than a
few of the closest solvents should therefore play much of a role. Indeed, we might venture
that only the single largest contribution, from the single most strongly coupled solvent is
important,31,32

GF (t) =

w′[r0j(t)] w′[r0j(0)] ˙r0j(t) ˙r0j(0)

(2.8)

What we suggest here is that this latter idea is virtually exact; that the high-frequency
dynamics of a solute-centered correlation function stems almost entirely from the binary
dynamics of a single solute-solvent pair — and all we need do is compute the nonlinear,
anharmonic dynamics of this pair for each instantaneous liquid conﬁguration.

There are actually a number of kinds of evidence supporting our analysis. An immediate
consequence of our argument is that the binary terms in Eq. (2.5) ought to be signiﬁcantly
larger than the ternary terms at short times. Indeed, exact molecular dynamics simulations
have established the overwhelming predominance of the binary contributions to the GF (t)
vibrational relaxation correlation functions.32 Interestingly, one ﬁnds the predicted strong
preferences for the (presumably) less collective binary part even when the relaxation takes
place in dipolar solvents, liquids whose intermolecular forces are suﬃciently long–ranged that
the friction η(t) itself ends up with major contributions from ternary terms.14,32 The reasons
for this diﬀerence between binary and ternary are clear from a short–time perspective. At
equilibrium (t = 0), the force–velocity version of the vibrational friction is rigorously binary,
because, as we can see from Eq.
(2.6), the velocities of diﬀerent solvent molecules are
rigorously independent. The actual equilibrium friction, by contrast, does not even start
out as binary at t = 0; the equilibrium structure of the liquid builds in correlations that
have nothing to do with the subsequent dynamical evolution. But even away from t = 0, the
wide range of values possible for the couplings serves to explain the observation. The sheer
unlikelihood of having two diﬀerent solvents so similar in their distance from the solute that

9

they end up making comparable contributions will also prevent much of a ternary presence
in the answer.

We can see somewhat more direct evidence of the two-particle character of the essential
dynamics by looking in the frequency domain with the aid of INM theory. INM theories
cannot addresss any of the truly high-frequency dynamics, but if we conﬁne ourselves to
the highest frequencies inside the INM band, we invariably ﬁnd that the vibrational friction
spectrum (ρvib(ω) = (2/π) ˆGF (ω)) is given quantitatively by the portion arising from the
motion of the solute and the single largest contributing solvent.31,32 Moreover, as with the
molecular dynamics studies, these ﬁndings seems to be completely independent of how oth-
erwise collective the solvent motion is. The question we are left with, therefore, is whether
the nature of the relaxation really does change qualitatively as we cross the band edge. It
does not seem all that far fetched for this same two–particle scenario that works so well just
inside the band to apply at higher frequencies as well.

B. The High-Frequency Parts of the Vibrational Relaxation Correlation Function

To make our subsequent development more concrete, suppose we specialize to the familiar
case of a diatomic solute dissolved in an atomic liquid. Taking the atoms of the diatomic
to be labeled as 1 and 2 (with masses m1 and m2), and indexing the atoms of the solvent
by j = 3, . . . , N, we ﬁnd that if the potential energy of interaction between the solute and
the solvent can be written in terms of site-site pair potentials

V =

[u1(r1j) + u2(r2j)] ,

Xj>2

then the force acting on the diatomic’s bond is given by

Let us now consider what the highest frequency parts of the force–velocity correlation
function, Eq. (2.1), would look like for such a force. Generalizing our arguments in the
previous section, we would expect that the dominant contribution would come (at most) from
the two solvent atoms, call them a and b, nearest the two solute sites 1 and 2 (respectively).60
Furthermore, given the rapid variation of the site-site potentials u1,2(r) in the region of
interest, we might also expect the terms involving the second derivative u′′(r) to be far more
important than those involving the ﬁrst derivative u′(r). Hence we should be able to express
the correlation function as just

with cos θAj(t)
since it requires that we know no more than the dynamics of 4 degrees of freedom, it already
represents a major simpliﬁcation over the full many–body problem. We can make one last
simpliﬁcation, however. The variation of the cos θAj(t) angular factors is also guaranteed
to be far smaller than that of the u′′(r) factors at short times, if only because of the small
dynamic range of the cosine function (

high–frequency behavior it therefore suﬃces to approximate the cosine by its t = 0 value.

with respect to the two solute sites.

C. Mutual–Nearest–Neighbor Dynamics

Of course, since we are in a liquid, the exact dynamics of even this small a number of
degrees of freedom is still intimately connected with the dynamics of the remainder. Were we
unable to achieve any reduction of this dynamics comparable to the simpliﬁcation we found
for the correlation function, there would thus be little practical advantage to our formalism.
Fortunately, the same kinds of analysis we have been pursuing also reveal a wonderful
dynamical separability: the important solvents end up being dynamically decoupled from
the rest of the solvent as well.

This basic notion of dynamical separability is illustrated by looking at the time evolution
of a mutual–nearest–neighbor pair of atoms in an atomic liquid.31,49 The equations of motion
for any two atoms a and b, with masses ma and mb, are

provided all the atoms interact by pair potentials u(r). But, if these two particular atoms
form a mutual–nearest–neighbor pair, then u′(rab) will be signiﬁcantly larger than any of
the other forces aﬀecting the pair. Hence, to within a high level of accuracy, the relative
acceleration will be given by

Equation (2.14) is intriguing, but it is not as simple as it may appear; the evolution
ab is controlled by other forces besides u′(rab) (and
of the centrifugal acceleration term rabΩ2
thus by the motion of other atoms besides a and b). However it is fairly easy to see that this
term too is almost always going to be negligible compared to the intra–pair force. We can
estimate its size by using the equipartion theorem to get the mean–square angular velocity61

ab). If we take the pair potential to be of the Lennard–Jones form,
u(r) = 4ǫ[(σ/r)12
(σ/r)6], and we then make the (very) conservative estimate that a
typical intra–pair distance rab = σ, we ﬁnd that a typical value of the centrifugal force is
(kBT /ǫ)(ǫ/σ), whereas a typical intermolecular force is 24(ǫ/σ). Hence under any liquid–
state conditions, indeed at anything other than the most extreme supercritical conditions,
we can safely neglect such centrifugal contributions.62 The dynamics of a mutual–nearest–
neighbor pair of atoms is therefore well described by a simple, purely radial, equation of
motion:

even in a dense liquid.

This same argument can easily be adapted to the vibrational relaxation example we
considered in the last section. If only one atom (say number 1) of our diatomic solute forms
a mutual nearest neighbor pair with a solvent atom (solvent a), then the equations of motion
for the critical solvent atom and for Rcm, the position of the diatomic’s center of mass, are
given accurately by63

As we did before, we can now turn to the non–radial terms. The second, solute–solvent
centrifugal, term in Eq. (2.18) can be discarded for precisely the same reasons we just went
through; on the average this term is far smaller than the radial force u′
1(r1a). The third
term seems to present a new case, inasmuch as it arises directly from the rotational motion
of the diatomic solute. Yet, we can argue that it too should be small. Barring pathological
situations, the interatomic separation and the reduced mass for the diatomic should be
comparable to those of a solute–atom/solvent–atom mutual–near–neighbor pair. We should
therefore expect similar results for the centrifugal terms

predict that, except for very rare liquid conﬁgurations, one of the two tagged solvent atoms
will be far more important than the other in determining the force along the bond. We
therefore expect that we should never have to do more than solve an equation of the form
of Eq. (2.19) for the most important solvent/solute–site pair.

D. Putting the Pieces Together

Because all we need to know for a given liquid conﬁguration is the location of the critical
solvent closest to one end of the solute or the other, our working formula for the vibrational
relaxation correlation function is simply,

for any homonuclear diatomic dissolved in an atomic liquid. Here r is the distance between
the special solvent and the nearest solute atom, gmnn(r; ˆr12) is the probability density of r,
what we shall call the solute’s mutual–nearest–neighbor distribution function, and θ(0) is
the initial orientation of the solvent/solute–atom pair relative to the bond direction, ˆr12.
The necessary dynamics launched from that conﬁguration, r(t), is then prescribed by the
equation of motion

which is the equilibrium probability density for ﬁnding a solvent atom that is both a mutual
nearest neighbor and is displaced by r from one end of the solute (ρ being the solvent
number density). In the event that both solute sites are members of mnn pairs,60 the primed
summation selects the site, A, whose partner is closest. Consistent with this deﬁntion, by
the brackets with subscript r, we mean just the equilibrium average over initial velocities v
in Eqs. (2.21) and (2.22), carried out at ﬁxed r.

The ultimate test of our approach, of course, will be its numerical accuracy in reproducing
the true high–frequency vibrational friction, but even in advance of such tests it is worth
looking at the internal consistency of the theory. Supposing for the moment that our basic
idea is correct — that one or two critical solvents dominate the instantaneous friction — we
still have to remember that the rest of the liquid continues to evolve while the critical solvent
is moving. Is it even obvious that the particular solvent that makes up the initial mnn pair
with the solute remains an mnn pair throughout the relevant time window? As we shall
see, for Xe liquid the high–frequency part of the friction is largely determined by dynamics
occuring at times less than 300 fs. A typical speed for the mnn distance is (kBT /µuv)1/2,
so at a temperature of 280 K, a diatomic such as I2 dissolved in Xe could have its mnn
distance change by about 0.5 ˚A during this time. However, the mnn distribution itself has
a full width at half maximum that is typically of this same order in dense Xe.64 It therefore
seems quite plausible that the identity of the mnn partner could be preserved long enough
for the theory to operate successfully.

III. INSTANTANEOUS NORMAL MODES AND INSTANTANEOUS–PAIR
THEORY

The ease with which we can perform calculations with Eqs.

(2.21) and (2.22) aside,
we have not really ﬁnished our task; there is still a conceptual gulf we need to cross. Our

14

theory for high–frequency vibrational population relaxation, does not, in itself, resolve the
central conﬂict between V–V and V–T pictures of the relaxation. On the one hand, the
instantaneous–pair theory certainly seems to suggest that high–frequency vibrations are
converted into the liquid’s translational degrees of freedom. Indeed, the whole motivation
for separating out the contributions of a single solvent is that the special solvent highest on
the repulsive wall of the intermolecular potential completely overshadows any other solvent
— and the fact that this sharply repulsive portion of intermolecular potentials is largely
what comes into play in the evaluation of the equations of motion means that the dynam-
ics is a case study in classical scattering rather than an example of bound-state motion.
In short, the relevant dynamics seems to resemble translation more than intermolecular
vibrations. By the same token, however, it is diﬃcult to reconcile this stance with the
noteable success of resonant–vibrational–energy–transfer models for frequencies within the
liquid’s band,30,32 especially given the observations that there are binary features within
the instantaneous–normal–mode band.31,32 It would not be impossible for the mechanism of
vibrational relaxation to switch as we go from one frequency regime to another, but such
a pronounced dichotomy would be especially problematic in the immediate vicinity of the
band edge.

One way to think about this dilemma is to ask what would happen if we tried to con-
struct an instantaneous–normal–mode treatment assuming that all of the assumptions of
the instantaneous–pair theory were, in fact, correct. That is, suppose we assume that the
vibrational–friction correlation really is given by the instantaneous-pair approximation of
(2.21) and that the dynamics really ought to be that prescribed by the matching
Eq.
instantaneous–pair approximation of Eq. (2.22). Rather than solving Eq. (2.22) exactly,
an INM theory would make an instantaneous harmonic estimate for the time evolution: the
displacement from the initial pair separation would be written as65

However, besides just assuming that the dynamics was harmonic, the traditional, lin-
earized version of INM theory would go one, key, step further. The evolution of the coupling
force, here u′(r), would be linearized in the mode coordinate57

u′[r(t)]

(3.2)

This step is what leads to the appealing form of both INM linearized solvation theory and
the INM theory for vibrational friction.28–33,40 The appearance of what have been called the
INM inﬂuence spectra stems from this very step. But it should be clear from our analysis of
instantaneous–pair theory that this step is strongly suspect under the very conditions that
lead to high-frequency relaxation. If the intermolecular potential is really sharply varying,
then that is the last place where one should attempt a low–order expansion.

We could raise the same kinds of doubts about the harmonic dynamics of Eq. (3.1),
but suppose, for the moment, we pursue just the issue of nonlinearity in the coupling. How
would the nonlinearity alone make itself felt? We can present this question more generally if

15

we return to a general solute–centered correlation function introduced in Sec. II A. Within
the framework of the instantaneous–pair assumptions, the correlation function we need to
evaluate is of the form

where w(r) is some spectroscopic probe potential which may, but need not, be related to
u(r), the pair potential governing the dynamics.

Were we to linearize w(r) the same way that we did the force in Eq. (3.2), Eq. (3.1)
would allow us to write the correlation function as the cosine transform of an inﬂuence
spectrum, ρ(ω), a standard INM outcome.

Hn(x) = (2x)n plus lower powers in x,66 it is easy to show that each Vn integral is a polyno-
mial form in cos ω0t and sin ω0t, and that the leading (highest order) term is proportional
to cosn ω0t = cos nω0t + lower order harmonics of ω0. In other words, each successive term
brings in successively higher–order overtones of the fundamental INM band of the liquid.
The instantaneous pair theory with INM dynamics is thus a genuine multi–phonon theory
of high-frequency vibrational relaxation in liquids — as long as the proper respect is paid
to the nonlinearity of the coupling.36,67

We should hasten to point out that a literal term by term evaluation of this sum is
not necessarily going to be of any great computational help. For one thing,
it is not
straightforward to write the n–th order equivalent of the (one–phonon) inﬂuence spec-
(3.5). Since Vn not only has terms of the form cos nω0t, but can include
trum, Eq.
cos (n
2)ω0t, . . . , and cos ω0t terms as well, the ﬁnal n–phonon spectrum
could have contributions from Vn, Vn+1, and all of the higher–order integrals. A more fun-
damental way of making this same point is to remember that there is no real reason to
expect that any low–order truncation of the multi–phonon series will adequately describe
the relaxation process. A more realistic approach to the problem might require us to sum
the series to inﬁnite order, at least in some approximate fashion.

theory.

IV. NUMERICAL RESULTS

A. Numerical Methods and Models

In this section we numerically evaluate the vibrational friction felt by a rigid homonuclear
diatomic molecule dissolved in an atomic liquid. The atoms of the solvent are taken to
interact with each other and with the two atoms of the solute through Lennard–Jones pair
potentials

though the solvent atom–solvent atom (vv) and solute atom–solvent atom (uv) Lennard–
Jones parameters can diﬀer, as can the masses of the solute and solvent atoms (mu and mv,
respectively). While the eﬀect of the solvent on the intramolecular vibration is the whole

point of these calculations, for the purposes of computing the friction, the solute atoms can
be regarded as being separated by a ﬁxed distance req.

For purposes of deﬁniteness, we regard our solvent as ﬂuid Xe (σvv = 4.1 ˚A, ǫvv =
222 K, mv = 131.3 amu).69 The two speciﬁc solution models we consider are the standard
Tuckerman and Berne model,12,13 in which the two solute atoms are regarded as identical to
the solvent atoms,

σuv = σvv , ǫuv = ǫvv , mu = mv , req = 1.25σvv ,

and the model used by Brown, Harris, and Tully,70

σuv = 3.94 ˚A, ǫuv = 324 K, mu = 126.9 amu, req = 2.67 ˚A .

This latter model was explored largely in response to experimental studies by Paige, Russell
and Harris of the relaxation of highly vibrationally–excited I2 dissolved in Xe.53

Our theoretical predictions were constructed so as to rely solely on the equilibrium prop-
erties of the solutions being studied. We were therefore able to obtain the information we
needed by using standard canonical–ensemble Monte Carlo simulations71 with 106 solvent
atoms and an immobile diatomic solute. All of these simulations employed periodic bound-
ary conditions and had their maximum–move distances adjusted to achieve a 50% acceptance
rate for the Metropolis attempted moves. Ensemble averages were then computed by sam-
pling ﬂuid conﬁgurations every Nt such attempts, with Nt chosen so as to ensure minimal
conﬁguration–conﬁguration correlation in the force along the diatomic’s bond. The actual
values of Nt ranged from a low of 2000 for dense gases to as high as 5000 for high–density
ﬂuids. When exact dynamical results were needed to give us something with which we could
compare, we carried out full molecular dynamics simulations on the same rigid–diatomic–
plus–106–solvent system, now allowing the diatomic to translate and rotate. Speciﬁcally,
classical trajectories of length τLJ [τLJ = (mvvσ2
vv/ǫvv)1/2 = 3.47ps] were computed start-
ing from each of 105 (uncorrelated) Monte–Carlo generated conﬁgurations using the Rattle
version of the velocity–Verlet integrator72 with a time step of 0.001 τLJ . The initial velocities
for these trajectories were selected from the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution.73

Results for the pair theories were obtained in much the same way as the exact molec-
ular dynamics, but the requisite trajectories involved only the motion of one–dimensional
solute–solvent distances r(t). The outcome for the full instantaneous–pair theory could
therefore calculated by using a simple velocity–Verlet integration starting from the Monte–
Carlo generated liquid–state conﬁgurations.72,74 Averaging over the initial velocities was then
(40kBT /µuv)1/2, appropriately
accomplished by using 40 velocities equally spaced between
weighting by the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution. The computation with the alternative
pair theory, the corresponding nonlinear–INM approach, was even easier, since it only needed
the analytical dynamics of Eq. (3.1), though it too required numerical averaging over the
initial velocities.

All cosine transforms were performed using standard FFT methods.75

We begin our exploration by looking at the vibrational friction felt in the Tuckerman and
Berne model of a diatomic solute dissolved in a high density supercritical ﬂuid. As one can

B. Basic Results

19

see from the bottom panel of Fig. 1, our earlier linearized–INM theory (the long–dashed line)
does a reasonably credible job of reproducing the shape of the exact–molecular–dynamics–
derived friction (the solid line) within the band of the liquid. However once we venture
beyond the band edge (upper panel) the discrepancy between the two becomes painfully
obvious. By contrast, the full instantaneous pair theory (the short–dashed line) provides
a virtually quantitative match to the exact results at these higher frequencies. Apparently
combining a nonlinear treatment of the solvent coupling with an anharmonic approach to
the solvent dynamics amply suﬃces to capture the missing high–frequency response of the
solvent — and it does so despite our omission of all but an inﬁnitesmal fraction of the solvent
dynamics. The relatively poor performance of the same instantaneous–pair theory within
the solvent band (lower panel) continues to remind us, at the same time, that an accurate
treatment of the low–frequency regime requires a proper inclusion of the more collective
aspects of the solvent’s motion.

These same points are made more explicitly by using Eq. (1.1) to compute the actual
vibrational energy relaxation rates from the friction. As we can see from Table I, the
instantaneous–pair theory precisely mimics the two–orders–of–magnitude drop in relaxation
rate that transpires once we go from vibrations in the middle of the liquid’s band to those
100 cm−1 outside the band. Yet, within the band, the rate predicted by this theory is
consistently too small, just what we might have surmised would happen if we were leaving
out the dynamical channels for relaxation provided by many–body motions. Linearized INM
theory, on the other hand, behaves in a perfectly complementary fashion. It gives sensible
relaxation rates within the band, but can do no better than trace out the precipitous decay
of the band edge once we start to leave the band.

Our next question, clearly, is whether the success of the full pair theory means that a
harmonic approach to the solvent dynamics suddenly becomes inappropriate at high fre-
quencies. Looking again at the high–frequency friction, Fig. 2, we ﬁnd that if retain the
exact nonlinearity in Eq.
(2.21), but use instantaneous–normal–modes to prescribe the
mutual–nearest–neighbor–pair dynamics, Eq. (3.1), the resulting friction spectrum is still
virtually quantitative in its agreement with the exact molecular dynamics. As we might
have anticipated from the multiphonon discussion in the last Section, having nonlinear cou-
pling allows even harmonic dynamics to span a realistic frequency range. What we might
not have predicted, however, was that the coupling was so much more important than the
anharmonicity that incorporating the nonlinearity of the coupling was all one needed to do
to recover accurate vibrational relaxation rates.76

The level of similarity between these two pair theories is actually even greater than it
might appear on the scale of Fig. 2. One of the more dramatic ﬁndings of the studies of
vibrational relaxation in the solid state is that once the amount of energy transferred gets
large enough, relaxation rates tend to obey an exponential gap law.5,6,45,46 That is, the rates
depend on the frequency of the solute vibration ω roughly as

where ωchar is some characteristic phonon frequency of the solid. There is a long history
to these kinds of exponential relations for a variety of diﬀerent kinds of energy transfer
processes,77 but the particular application to solids is well known to follow directly from

20

a multiphonon picture of the relaxation: steepest–descent evaluation of the relaxation rate
predicts the rate to be exponential in the number of phonons excited.

What happens in liquids?17,38 A logarithmic plot of the relaxation rate, Fig. 3, shows that
the decline in the molecular–dynamics–computed rate with solute frequency is indeed close
to exponential, a trend reproduced exceptionally well by the instantaneous pair theory. In
fact, given the numerical diﬃculties inherent in extracting the high–frequency components
of a molecular–dynamics trajectory,38 we might venture to suggest that the pair theory
results are actually the more reliable of the two at high frequencies.74,78 Interestingly, the
exponential line that the two curves seem to follow is

actually requires a little qualiﬁcation. Our formula for t0 expresses it as a function of α0,
which, itself is a function of the initial mnn distance r(0). However we can evaluate an
average α0 a priori by using the α0 values of Eq. (3.11) for the solute–solvent Lennard–
Jones potential averaged over the equilibrium distribution of initial mnn distances, Eq.
(2.23). The resulting α0 is what is used to generate the t0 for the long–dashed line in the
ﬁgure.79

Of course, coming back to the solid–state analogy, we could regard an exponential gap law
coming out of nonlinear INM predictions as completely consistent with our multiphonon–like
interpretation of the INM theory. In fact, it is not hard to show that our simple analytical
results of Eqs. (3.14), (3.15), and (3.17) do predict the same exponential decay as the full
instantaneous pair theory (Fig. 3, bottom panel). Apparently, even with this intrinsically
vibrational picture of the solvent dynamics embedded in the calculation, the agreement
between the pair theories with harmonic and anharmonic dynamics is robust enough to
span a number of decades of solvent response.

It is revealing to think in some detail about this remarkable agreement between the
full instantaneous pair theory and its nonlinear–coupling/harmonic–dynamics analogue. A
closer inspection of the two theories in the time domain, Fig. 4, emphasizes the apparently
fundamental diﬀerences between the two views of the dynamics.
If we restrict ourselves
to a single initial liquid conﬁguration, as the ﬁgure does, we see that the harmonic curve
reﬂects the oscillatory character of bound–state motion, whereas the lack of periodicity
in the full (anharmonic) result is consistent with what the pair dynamics really is — a
scattering process. So why should such disparate views lead to the same results? The
answer is suggested by the third curve in Fig. 4, which also assumes harmonic dynamics but
truncates the coupling at linear order, precisely the sort of theory we would conﬁgurationally
average to arrive at Eqs. (3.4) and (3.5). It is evident that neither of the two harmonic
curves provides all that faithful a rendering of the anharmonic dynamics, but what stands
out is that the nonlinear coupling allows for a much more accurate reconstruction of the
correlation function at short times, reproducing not only the initial decay of the exact
correlation function, but also its one oscillation.80

It certainly makes sense that the highest frequency behavior of the friction depends
critically on the shortest time dynamics, but we can say a little more than that. Obviously,
to get the correct high–frequency Fourier transform of GF (t), it is important that we know
its behavior everywhere it changes rapidly — which includes both the initial fall–oﬀ and

21

the subsequent rebound we just referred to. Equally important, though, is the fact that
when these single–conﬁguration correlation functions are averaged, the spurious oscillatory
behavior of the harmonic picture that we see at longer times, which seems to portray solvent
molecules as colliding with the solute over and over again, dephases away to nothing. Thus,
at least within the time window provided by the rapid decay of the mnn bond–force–velocity
correlation, vibrational motion can indeed manage to look identical to single scattering
events. To put it another way, for our own limited purposes of computing vibrational
population relaxation rates, we can evidently continue to regard the essential liquid dynamics
as intermolecular vibrations, both at high and at low frequencies.

C. Thermodynamic State Dependence and the Application to I2 in Xe

We close our discussion with a look at a more experimentally oriented calculation, that for
the vibrational population relaxation of the ﬁrst vibrationally–excited state of I2 dissolved
in ﬂuid Xe at 280 K.17,53

To begin with, we should note that from xenon’s perspective, the I2 vibrational fre-
quency of (ω/2πc) = 211 cm−1 actually qualiﬁes as a rather high frequency. As is clear
from Fig. 5, this frequency lies well outside the INM band of Xe liquid (and even further
outside the band of lower density Xe). It therefore confronts us with precisely the issues we
have been discussing. Another interesting feature of this example, though, is that at this
temperature, Xe can be taken from dense liquid, through the liquid–gas coexistence region,
into a rariﬁed gas. We can therefore examine a range of dynamical possibilities within this
one example. The only additional step we need to take is to provide some way to compute
the relaxation rates within the coexistence region using data taken only from single–phase,
constant temperature and volume, simulations.

To meet this last requirement, we assume that the rate at which a solute relaxes vibra-
tionally, T −1, is far faster than the rate at which it moves between liquid and gaseous regions.
Under these conditions, the experimentally measured relaxation rate should be simply the
weighted sum

T −1 = xliq

T −1
(cid:16)

(cid:17)

liq

+ xgas

T −1

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

where (T −1)liq and (T −1)gas are the relaxation rates calculated along the coexistence line
in the liquid and gaseous phases, respectively, and xliq and xgas are the respective mole
fractions of the two phases at the given temperature and total number density ρ. These
mole fractions, in turn, are derived from the lever rule

(4.3)

(4.4)

xliq = 1

,

and the values of ρliq and ρgas, the individual densities of the liquid and gas phases.

Accordingly, if we use the full instantaneous pair theory to evaluate the relaxation rates
in the liquid and the gas, and we allow Eqs. (4.3) and (4.4) to interpolate between the
liquid (1.7 g/mL) and gaseous (0.44 g/mL) coexistence densities,81 we ﬁnd that we can
follow the vibrational lifetime of I2 over a wide range in solvent density (Fig. 6). The
general behavior shown here, that vibrational lifetimes decrease monotonically with density,

22

is hardly surprising, but a number of features of this graph are worthy of some attention. For
one thing, we note that the simple pair theory predicts lifetimes that are essentially identical
to those computed by the elaborate molecular dynamics simulations of Brown, Harris, and
Tully, at least at the two densities that those authors were able to study.70 However, the
computational simplicity of the pair theory makes it straighforward for us to trace the
overall trends with thermodynamic state as well. The basic increase in relaxation rate that
we see with density (a 16–fold increase over the same interval where the density increases
by roughly a factor of 6) is something that one would have expected based in independent–
binary–collision (IBC) models.52,53,55 Those models, though, would attribute the increase to
a hypothetical growth in the “collision rate”. In the instantaneous–pair theory, by contrast,
the solvent density inﬂuences only the equilibrium probability of having a given mutual–
nearest–neighbor pair distance; higher densities translating into smaller average distances.
The subsequent dynamics — and therefore the relaxation rate for that mnn distance —
is controlled solely by the temperature, which sets the initial velocity distribution of the
solute–solvent pair, but which we hold ﬁxed throughout the calculation here.

The similar experimental consequences of the two diﬀerent theoretical models make it
diﬃcult to distinguish them just by measuring relaxation rates versus density. We empha-
size, however, the IBC model’s reliance on an ill–deﬁned collision–radius parameter,52,53,55
something the more microscopically deﬁned instantaneous–pair theory has no need for. In
all fairness, we should also point out that both models lead to results that are extraordinarily
sensitive to the precise shape of the repulsive wall of the solvent–solute potential. Indeed, the
potentials employed here (and by Brown et al)70 predict relaxation rates diﬀering by about
a factor of 5 from the experimental estimates.17 That the likely origin of this discrepancy
does lie in the intermolecular potentials is supported by our ﬁnding that small changes in
the repulsive portion of the potential can shift our relaxation times by as much as an order
of magnitude. This sensitivity implies that we could tune our results to be more in accord
with the experimental data,17 but since such curve ﬁtting is not particularly germane to the
issues at hand, we will leave the matter here.

V. CONCLUDING REMARKS

The overriding goal of this paper was not really to ﬁnd out how quickly dissolved
molecules can get rid of large quantities of vibrational energy, but to learn how we should
visualize such processes in molecular detail. To that end we deliberately phrased the issues
in terms of somewhat oversimpliﬁed caricatures. Genuine molecular motion in liquids is nei-
ther the simple vibrations of crystals nor the occasionally interrupted ballistic motion found
in gases. What we envisioned, though, was that keeping these two limiting cases in mind
would serve to frame the possibilities. Even if the literal truth ended up being somewhere in
the middle, we presumed that we would still be able to say whether molecules tended to lose
vibrational energy by ﬁnding a matching vibration–like motion somewhere in the solvent
(a more–or–less V–V event) or whether it was better to regard relaxing solutes as simply
adding generic translational kinetic energy to the solvent (mostly a V–T process).

Much to our surprise, the real situation turned out to be far more narrowly deﬁned than
we anticipated.
In eﬀect, we found that the structural disorder of liquids conspires with
the short–ranged, rapidly–varying character of repulsive intermolecular forces to prescribe

23

a remarkably speciﬁc route for vibrational relaxation. The key to our understanding of this
speciﬁcity was the idea of taking an instantaneous perspective: of looking at each liquid
conﬁguration and asking what the subsequent time evolution ought to be for short time
intervals. The sharply varying character of the largest magnitude intermolecular forces tells
us that out of all of the solvent molecules that could participate in the relaxation at a given
instant, only the very nearest solvent should play a signiﬁcant role in determining the high–
frequency component of the solute–solvent coupling. This observation is central because it
means that we only need to ascertain the dynamics of the solute and the special solvent.
What is both more important and more unexpected though, are two realizations stemming
from the basic properties of liquids: ﬁrst, when the liquid structure is such as to have the
special solvent molecule closer to the solute than to any other molecule in the solution (i.e.,
when the solute and the special solvent molecule are a mutual–nearest–neighbor–pair), then
the pair motions themselves will dynamically decouple from those of the rest of the system;
second, that these particular liquid–disorder–induced situations are precisely the critical
ones dominating the high–frequency relaxation dynamics. For the kinds of intermolecular
distances and potentials typically found in liquids, then, we see that the crucial dynamics is
simply that of a two–body scattering process.

Basic to all of this discussion is our assumption that the critical portion of the time
evolution takes place at short times. In part, this assumption is valid because of our concern
about high frequencies,51 but equally, it stems from the short (few hundred fs) decay times
characteristic of the force–autocorrelation function which serves to determine the vibrational
friction. Of course, this time scale, as well, has its origin in the same fundamental ideas
that we have been discussing. The harsh repulsive forces lead to a rapid decorrelation of the
molecular trajectories and the average over the structural disorder of the liquid washes out
any longer–time correlations that might remain.

The presence of this short time scale was important to us not only in that it let us
formulate our theory, but in its implications for the choice between V–V and V–T mecha-
nisms. The fact that the dynamics has a scattering ﬂavor is certainly more reminiscent of
the gas phase than the solid state, but what we discovered was that for times this short,
the distinctions simply evaporate. There is no discernable diﬀerence between the high–
frequency vibrational friction evaluated as a scattering problem and the friction evaluated
with instantaneous–harmonic — vibration–like — bound–state motion. As long as the cou-
pling is suﬃciently nonlinear, harmonics of the fundamental vibration can evidently play
the precise role occupied by more impulsive kinematics. The short answer to our basic
question is therefore that we can always think of solute as resonantly transfering energy to
vibrational motions of the solvent; to the instantaneous normal modes for solute energies
within the band of the liquid and to overtones of those modes for higher energies. This last
interpretation is obviously not unique, but it has the conceptual advantage of allowing us
to think of the progression from lower to higher vibrational energies as a gradual evolution
in the kinds of dynamics the liquid has to bring to bear on the relaxation.

This continued success of harmonic perspectives on liquid dynamics actually sends yet
another message by highlighting one of the issues we raised in the Introduction. It is hardly
disputable that understanding anharmonicity is vital to understanding liquid dynamics, but
the distinctions between the diﬀerent ﬂavors of anharmoncity have signiﬁcant consequences.
If we needed to be able to model the detailed breakdown of the harmonic–mode picture of the

24

underlying dynamics in order to treat vibrational relaxation, we would have had a daunting
task in front of us. Indeed, before we launched this work, this worrisome prospect was a
legitimate concern; over the long times that it actually takes a molecule to rid itself of its
vibrational energy, individual instantaneous normal modes completely lose any semblance
of their original identities.49 What we have discovered, though, is that the primary issue
in high-frequency behavior is the nonlinearity of the coupling being driven by the liquid
dynamics, not the nonlinearity of the dynamics per se — and that this much more limited
variety of anharmonicity is not all that diﬃcult to understand.

This same kind of distinction is actually a rather familiar one to spectroscopists. Early on
in the history of infrared and Raman spectra, distinctions were drawn between “mechanical”
and “electrical” anharmonicities in the vibrational spectra of individual molecules.82 More
recently, however, the issue has been the focus of considerable attention in the context of
trying to understanding ﬁfth–order nonresonant Raman spectra of liquids as a whole.48,83–89
Purely harmonic systems would give rigorously zero signal in these experiments, so the very
existence of a measurable signal is evidence of anharmonicity. But as Okumura and Tan-
imura were quick to point out,48,84 the same signals could arise equally well from fundamental
liquid–dynamical anharmonicities or from nonlinearities in the polarizability dependence on
normal modes (violations of the Placzek approximation).86 Just as we found here, the con-
tribution of derivatives beyond the ﬁrst for a spectroscopic probe potential (whether it be
a force on a bond or a many–body polarizability) can be quite eﬀective in extending the
ways a liquid can respond to a probe.
In fact, in perfect analogy to what we saw here,
the polarizability nonlinearities can apparently be a much larger determinant of the spectra
than the underlying liquid anharmonicities.90

Curiously, the results of this paper seem as if they can also be taken as supporting
the independent–binary–collision model of vibrational relaxation. The centrality of solute–
solvent pairs in the process was, if anything, put on ﬁrmer microscopic ground by our results.
However, there are some key distinctions between IBC theory and what we have presented
here. The most important of these is where the equilibrium considerations stop and where the
dynamical concerns take over. Within IBC theory the existence, the precise deﬁnition, and, a
fortiori, the rate of collisions all rely heavily on the liquid–state setting. Only the collision–
induced vibrational relaxation itself is thought to be independent of the medium.11,50–55
With our instantaneous–pair model, though, the sole role of the many–body environment is
to prescribe the equilibrium distribution of special (mutual–nearest–neighbor) solute–solvent
pairs. These pair distances form the initial conﬁgurations for the dynamical calculation, but
all of this subsequent dynamics, including the distribution of initial pair velocities, are purely
few–body in character. We should emphasize that these distinctions are not merely technical.
The arbitrariness of IBC theory results from the diﬃcult task it has of solving enough of
the nonequilibrium statistical mechanics of the solution to extract a cleanly separable pair
motion from the remaining background. Lacking a deﬁnitive solution, IBC applications are
compelled to adopt ad hoc deﬁnitions of collisions, postulating such criteria as minimum
collision radii.52,53 By contrast, the crisp separation with instantaneous pair ideas between
many–body equilibrium information and few–body dynamics, not only removes any need
for guesswork, it might even allow for future quantum mechanical treatments of vibrational
relaxation based on the relative ease with which we can do two–body quantum scattering
calculations.91

25

There are some other directions the instantaneous pair theory should be extended in
as well. All of the numerical examples explored here were based on the rather limited
possibilities presented by a diatomic solute dissolved in an atomic solvent. The easiest
generalization of this work to polyatomic solutes and solvents would probably have us focus
on mutual nearest neighbor pairs between individual solute sites and solvent sites. However
the success of such an approach is far from assured; sites within a molecule are always
going to be strongly correlated. Thus in spite of the strongly binary character already
seen in INM vibrational friction spectra with molecular solvents,32 a fully general version
of instantaneous–pair theory remains to be demonstrated. The potential applicability to
understanding how solvents mediate the vibrational energy relaxation of complex multi–
mode polyatomics, in particular, presents a natural extension we ﬁnd especially intriguing.

24 The most accurate results are usually obtained by taking ω0 to be the solution–phase
value of the vibrational frequency rather than the isolated–molecule value, technically, a
renormalized perturbation theory result.

25 Typically (though not always) we expect the solute’s vibrations to behave quantum me-
chanically while the solvent acts largely classically. Quantum corrections computed from
semiclassical pictures of this sort have been explored in some depth in the literature.

29

Within some semiclassical models, the resulting quantum mechanical relaxation rates are
proportional to (or even equal to) the fully classical result, despite the rather high values

36 In two speculative but interesting papers, the authors described some of the results one
might someday obtain for the vibrational relaxation of polyatomic molecules in liquids if
instantaneous normal modes could actually function as solid–state–like phonons. Although
they presented no evidence for their supposition at the time, we show in this paper that
their suggestion that one can get multiple-phonon contributions to liquid–state relaxation
is, in fact, a correct one. V. M. Kenkre, A. Tokmakoﬀ, and M. D. Fayer, J. Chem. Phys.

37 The theorem is that (within this model) a solute oscillator of frequency ω cannot release its
energy directly to the solvent unless there are solvent oscillators of frequency ω. However,
we should point out that polyatomic molecules often relax by transferring a signiﬁcant
fraction of their excess vibrational quanta to one or more intramolecular modes of lower
frequency, leaving only a lesser amount of vibrational energy to be absorbed by the solvent.
See, for example, X. Hong, S. Chen, D. D. Dlott, J. Phys. Chem. 99, 9102 (1995) and Refs.
36 and 16. Nonetheless, even this smaller quantity of energy will often be well beyond the
putative band edge of the solvent.

59 In writing the friction in this fashion we have neglected a term proportional to δ(ω).
60 In our examples, two diﬀerent solvent atoms are mutual nearest neigbors of the two solute
atoms in about 30 percent of the liquid conﬁgurations. Most of the conﬁgurations, about
50 percent, have only a single solvent as a mutual nearest neighbor; the remainder are
such that the solute has no solvents as mutual nearest neighbors.

62 Typical liquid–state values for the temperature fall between the triple point and the critical
point, 0.7 < kBT /ǫ < 1.4. Typical mutual-nearest-neighbor distances rab are actually on
the order of 0.93σ in a Lennard–Jones liquid (see, for example, Ref. 31), which would imply
an even larger value of the intermolecular force than we used in our estimate. Indeed, the
fact that this small a change in the intermolecular distance leads to a value of the force 3.5
times larger is itself a good illustration why both the coupling and dynamics are dominated
by the solvent atoms nearest to the solute atoms.

63 It is worth pointing out that in deriving the Eq. (2.17), we did not need to assume that
the intermolecular force was larger than the intramolecular force; the intramolecular forces
operating on the two solute sites are necessarily equal and opposite and therefore make
no net contribution to the center–of–mass motion.

64 For I2 dissolved in Xe, 0.5˚A = 0.1σuv, whereas for a dense Lennard–Jones liquid, the full
width at half maximum of the mutual–nearest–neighbor distribution is about 0.09σ.

67 The concept of a liquid–state analog to the multiphonon processes seen in solids was also

discussed recently by Egorov and Berne (Ref. 25).

68 The analogous resummation for solid–state multiphonon vibrational relaxation is well
known. See Refs. 6 and 46. However we believe the results given here present microscopic
evidence that high frequency vibrational relaxation in liquids can be interpreted in a mul-
tiphonon language. Indeed, our INM results are somewhat diﬀerent from the expressions
that appear in the solid–state literature, not so much because of the quantum mechanical
character of the literature derivations (which give results identical in form to those from a
classical derivation), but because of the INM approach’s explicit inclusion of anharmonic-
ity in the distribution of initial conditions.

69 Our LJ parameters for xenon are identical to those used in the simulations of Brown,

Harris and Tully, Ref. 70.

74 In order to facilitate comparisons, the integrator and the time step employed here were
the same as that for the full molecular dynamics simulation, velocity–Verlet and 0.001τLJ,
respectively. However since the instantaneous–pair theory requires only a one–dimensional
trajectory, it would have been computationally trivial to use a higher order integrator and
a far smaller time step had we needed more reliable high–frequency information.

75 All Fourier transforms were performed using the FFT algorithm cosft, from W. H. Press,

(Cambridge University, London, 1994).

77 The theoretical origins of exponential gap laws governing single–collision vibrational exci-
tations are reviewed in M. S. Child, Molecular Collision Theory (Academic Press, London,
1974), Chaps. 7 and 8. For an example of a similar gap law for rotational excitation, see
J. C. Polanyi and K. B. Woodall, J. Chem. Phys. 56, 1563 (1972).

78 Inasmuch as we were careful to use the same molecular dynamics integrators and the same
size time steps with the pair–theory and with the full molecular dynamics calculation, the
pair theory’s superior numerical stability in Figs. 1 and 2 is striking. We attribute the
diﬀerence to the much higher level of velocity averaging possible with the pair theory.
79 The values of α0 turn out to be surprisingly constant, suggesting that even a Lennard–
Jones potential looks remarkably exponential insofar as high–frequency dynamics goes.
Over the full width at half maximum of the mutual–nearest–neighbor distribution for
this thermodynamic state (r/σ = 0.89 – 0.96), the value of α0 σ = 17.2
0.3 for the
Lennard–Jones potentials used here.

with inertial (constant force) dynamics (not shown) instead of harmonic dynamics, sum

rules would still generate the correct initial t2 decay for us, but the trajectories would soon
wander oﬀ into regions of impossibly high potential energy, leaving us with nonsensical
correlation functions.

FIG. 1. The vibrational friction felt by a vibrating diatomic molecule dissolved in a super-
critical atomic liquid. Shown here are a number of diﬀerent calculations for the real part of the
frequency–domain vibrational friction of the Tuckerman–Berne model system (under the standard
model conditions of reduced density ρσ3
vv = 1.05 and reduced temperature kBT /ǫvv = 2.5) in units
appropriate to a Xe solvent. The lower panel is the friction relevant to diatomic whose vibrational
frequency falls within the expected bandwidth of the solvent; the upper panel portrays the friction
for frequencies above the band edge. (Note the rather diﬀerent scales used in the two panels.)
In both panels, the rough solid line results from an exact molecular dynamics calculation of the
bond–force autocorrelation function, the long dashed line (visible only in the lower left hand corner
in the upper panel) shows the analogous predictions from linearized instantaneous–normal–mode
theory, and the short dashed line gives the analogous predictions from full instantaneous–pair
theory.

FIG. 2. The vibrational friction felt by a high-frequency vibrating diatomic molecule dissolved
in a supercritical atomic liquid. As in the upper panel of Fig. 1, the calculations are performed for
the standard Tuckerman–Berne model system (under the same thermodynamic conditions) with Xe
as the solvent, and the solid and short-dashed lines show the full–molecular–dynamics and the full
instantaneous–pair theory results, respectively. Here, however, the long–dashed line represents the
outcome of the nonlinearly–coupled instantaneous–normal–mode version of the pair theory. Both
pair theories interpret the relaxation as a few–body event in which only the initial conditions are
prescribed by the ﬂuid. They diﬀer in that the full instantaneous–pair–theory uses the anharmonic
dynamics of the key atoms to drive the evolution of the nonlinear solute–solvent coupling, whereas
the INM equivalent assumes harmonic dynamics drives this coupling. In contrast to both of these
treatments, the linear INM theory of Fig. 1 limits itself to linear coupling.

FIG. 3. The vibrational friction felt by a high–frequency vibrating diatomic molecule dissolved
in supercritical atomic Xe. In the upper panel, the instantaneous–pair (short dashes) and molec-
ular dynamics (solid line) results from Fig. 2 are replotted here on a semilog scale to emphasize
the near exponential–gap–law behavior. The lower panel compares the instantaneous–pair theory
of the upper panel to the analytical results, Eqs. (3.14), (3.15), and (3.17), where to generate
t0 we have used the value of α0 found by averaging over initial mnn distances. For the super-
critical ﬂuid, this average α0 is 17.2 σ−1
Xe = 4.2 ˚A−1, which yields a characteristic timescale,
t0 = 0.042 τLJ = 146f s. Numerical noise clearly makes it diﬃcult to follow the exact molecular
dynamics results over more than a limited frequency interval.
It is only by going beyond this
interval, however, that the small deviations from strictly exponential behavior begin to manifest
themselves in the form of a slight downward curvature to the predictions of the pair theories.

FIG. 4. The bond–force–velocity autocorrelation function for the standard Tuckerman–Berne
model system evaluated at a single initial liquid conﬁguration for three diﬀerent pair theories.
Shown here is a normalized version of the instantaneous correlation function appearing in Eq.
(2.21), < u′′[r(t)] u′′[r(0)] cos2 θ0 ˙r(t) ˙r(0) >r0, with the initial displacement between the key solute
and solvent atoms held ﬁxed at r0 =
= 0.95σuv and θ0 = 0. As in Figs. 1–3, the reduced
temperature kBT /ǫvv = 2.5. The solid and dotted lines both make use of the manifestly nonlinear
solute–solvent Lennard–Jones potential u(r) in evaluating u′′(r), but they take the time evolution
to be given by the anharmonic dynamics of Eq. (2.22) and the harmonic dynamics of Eq. (3.1)
respectively. The long dashed curve results from the corresponding linear INM theory: that is, from
employing both the harmonic dynamics and the linear coupling assumption u′′[r(t)]
u′′[r(0)].
For Xe, a time interval of 0.1 τLJ corresponds to about 350 fs.

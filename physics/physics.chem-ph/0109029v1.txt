The recent theoretical and experimental activities in positronium (Ps) scattering by atoms and
molecules are reviewed with special emphasis at low energies. We critically compare the results of
diﬀerent groups − theoretical and experimental. The theoretical approaches considered include the
R-matrix and close-coupling methods applied to Ps-H, Ps-He, and Ps-Li scattering, and a coupled-
channel approach with a nonlocal model-potential for Ps scattering by H, He, H2, Ne, Ar, Li, Na,
K, Rb, Cs, and Ps and for pickoﬀ quenching in Ps-He scattering. Results for scattering lengths,
partial, total and diﬀerential cross sections as well as resonance and binding energies in diﬀerent
systems are discussed.

I. INTRODUCTION

Due to the technical advancement in the preparation
of the ortho positronium (Ps) beam, precise experimen-
tal results for the total cross section of Ps scattering by
diﬀerent atomic and molecular targets are now available
[1–5]. Among recent experiments there have been mea-
surements of total cross section by Laricchia’s group for
energies up to 100 eV for H2, He, and Ar [1–3]. Gi-
dley’s group provided results for low-energy (∼ 1 eV)
elastic cross section for Ps scattering by H2, N2, He, Ar,
Ne, isobutane, and neopentane [4]. They also studied the
collisional quenching rate of ortho Ps at diﬀerent temper-
atures for these targets as well as for ethane and methane
[6]. Nagashima et al. provided cross section for Ps-He
scattering at 0.15 eV [5]. Hyodo provided new results for
quenching rate on diﬀerent targets at this workshop [7].
Among the older experiments there are results for zero-
energy Ps-He cross section and pickoﬀ quenching [8–11]
as well as low-energy cross-section of Ps scattering by no-
ble gases [12]. There are several comprehensive reviews
on this subject [13–16].

On the theoretical front, after the pioneering study of
Ps-H scattering by Massey and Mohr in 1954 [17] us-
ing the ﬁrst Born approximation with Oppenheimer ex-
change [18], there have been studies of Ps-H and Ps-He
scattering using the static exchange approximation, re-
spectively, by Fraser [19–22], and by Bransden [23,24]
and their collaborators in the decades of 1960 and 1970.
Drachman and Houston performed model calculations of
Ps-H [25,26] and Ps-He [27] scattering in the decade of
1970. There are also accurate calculations of resonance
[28–32] and binding energies [33–41] of Ps-H.

Extensive theoretical eﬀorts on Ps-H and Ps-He scat-
tering started in the decade of 1990 with the coupled
channel R-matrix and close-coupling (CC) approaches
by Walters [15,42,43] and Ghosh [44–53] and their col-
laborators. More recently, there has been successful cal-
culation of Ps scattering by H, He, Ne, Ar, Li, Na, K,
Cs, Rb, H2 and Ps using a model exchange potential
in a coupled-channel formalism by Biswas and this au-

thor [54–61]. This latter study produced, in addition to
cross sections, results for resonance and binding energies
of diﬀerent Ps-atom systems [62–64] as well as for pick-
oﬀ quenching rate of the interaction of ortho Ps with He
[65].

Of the diﬀerent Ps-atom systems, Ps-He is the most
studied system both theoretically and experimentally
and hence deserves special attention in addition to the
most fundamental Ps-H system on which there are some
accurate results for PsH binding [33–41] and resonance
energies [28–31]. However, there is considerable discrep-
ancy among the diﬀerent theoretical Ps-He cross sections
at zero energy.

On the experimental front, there have been conﬂict-
ing results for the low-energy Ps-He elastic cross section
by Nagashima et al. [5], who measured a cross section
of (13 ± 4)πa2
0 at 0.15 eV, by Coleman et al. [12], who
0 at 0 eV, by Canter et al. [8], who found
reported 9πa2
8.47πa2
0 at 0 eV, and by Skalsey et al. [4], who measured
(2.6 ± 0.5)πa2
0 at 0.9 eV. It is unlikely that all these ﬁnd-
ings could be consistent with each other.

The results for the total cross section of Ps-He scatter-
ing obtained from the coupled-channel calculation em-
ploying the model exchange potential
[56–58] are in
agreement with experiments of Refs. [1–4] at low energies
as well as with a variational scattering length [66]. This
model, while agrees [56–58] with the experimental total
cross sections [1,4] in the energy range 0 to 70 eV, repro-
duces [65] successfully the experimental pickoﬀ quenching
rate [8–11]. All other calculations could not reproduce
the general trend of cross sections of Ps-He scattering in
this energy range and yielded a much too small quench-
ing rate at low energies [23,21,65]. However, the very
low-energy elastic cross sections of the model-potential
calculation [56–58] are at variance with the experiments
of Refs. [5,8,12].

In the Ps-H system there are no experimental results of
scattering. However, there are theoretical calculations on
Ps-H binding [33–39] and resonance [28–31] energies and
scattering lengths [67]. These should be considered as
guidelines for testing the coupled-channel calculations us-

1

ing the R-matrix, CC, and model-potential approaches.
Of these only the model-potential calculation could pro-
vide nearly converged results for the binding and reso-
nance energies of PsH.

Of the three coupled-channel methods only the model-
potential approach has seen further successful applica-
tions in Ps scattering by Ne, Ar [58], Li [62], Na, K
[63], Rb, Cs [64], H2 [59–61], and Ps [68]. There has
been proposals [69,70] of Bose-Einstein condensation us-
ing spin-polarized ortho Ps atoms and a prior knowledge
of Ps-Ps scattering length is of advantage. For Ne and
Ar the low-energy results for elastic cross section are in
agreement with recent experiment [58], whereas for the
alkali-metal atoms new low-energy resonances have been
predicted. For Ps scattering by H2, good agreement with
experimental total cross section has been obtained at low
to medium energies [59,60].

II. MODEL-POTENTIAL APPROACH

The theory for the study of Ps scattering by R-matrix
[15] and CC [44,45] approaches has appeared in the liter-
ature and we refer the interested readers to appropri-
ate places. Here we only outline the model-potential
approach for Ps-H scattering [55]. The modiﬁcations
for more complex targets are straightforward and can
be found elsewhere [57,58]. The following Lippmann-

However, it can be varied slightly from unity to get a pre-
cise ﬁt to a low-energy observable. After a partial-wave
projection the coupled-channel scattering equations (2.1)
are solved by the method of matrix inversion.

III. NUMERICAL RESULTS

A. Ps-H System

There are no experimental results for this system. Ps-
H scattering has been studied with the static-exchange
model by Fraser [19,20], with the pseudo-state R-matrix
approach by McAlinden et al [43], with the CC approach
by Ghosh and collaborators [44–47], using a model-
potential by Drachman and Houston [25,26], and ﬁnally
by the coupled-channel model potential approach by
Biswas and this author [54,55]. In addition to these scat-
tering calculations there exist variational calculations for
PsH binding energy [33–39] and Ps-H scattering lengths
[67,73]. There are calculations for PsH resonance ener-
gies and width in diﬀerent partial waves at low energies
using the complex-coordinate rotation method [28–32].

The most accurate result for PsH binding (= 1.064661
eV) seems to be due to Frolov and Smith, Jr. [38]. Rel-
ativistic eﬀects on PsH has also been studied [41] where
a binding energy of 1.06404168 eV has been predicted.
Schrader et al. conﬁrmed the existence of PsH experi-
mentally [40]. The S-wave resonances in the Ps-H sys-
tem were studied by Drachman [32] and by Yan and Ho
[28,37]. The most accurate results for 2S and 3S energies
(width) are 4.0058 ± 0.0005 eV (0.0952 ± 0.0011 eV) and
4.9479±0.0014 eV (0.0585±0.0027 eV) [28], respectively.
The P- and D-wave resonances for this system were also
studied by Drachman [32] and by Yan and Ho [29,30].
The most accurate values for the 2P and 3P resonance
energies (widths) are 4.2850 ± .0014 eV (0.0435 ± 0.0027

eV) and 5.0540 ± 0.0027 eV (0.0585 ± 0.0054 eV) [29],
respectively; that for the 3D wave is 4.710 ± 0.0027 eV
(0.0925 ± 0.0054 eV) [30]. Ho and Yan [31] also studied
resonances in higher partial waves.

In the absence of experiments on Ps-H scattering, the
above accurate results could be used as critical tests
for the diﬀerent coupled-channel calculations. Camp-
bell et al. [43] performed a 22-pseudo-Ps-state R-matrix
calculation and predicted the following resonance ener-
gies (widths) in S, P and D waves, respectively: 4.55 eV
(0.084 eV), 4.88 eV (0.058 eV), and 5.28 eV (0.47 eV).
Compared to the resonances of Ho and Yan [28–30] the
agreement is fair. The PsH binding energy of Campbell
et al. [43] (0.634 eV) show similar convergence when com-
pared with the accurate results 1.064661 eV [38]. Their
singlet and triplet scattering lengths as = 5.20a0 and
at = 2.45a0 is only in qualitative agreement with varia-
tional results: as = (3.49 ± 0, 20)a0 [67] and 4.3a0 [73]
and at = (2.46 ± 0, 10)a0 [67] and 2.2a0 [73], respectively.
Walters et al. presented new results for Ps-H scattering
at this workshop in a (14 × 14) channel model contain-
ing 14 Ps states and 14 H states [74]. This preliminary
calculation shows that their elastic cross sections are sub-
stantially reduced and the scattering lengths are in better
agreement with variational results.

The CC calculations by Ghosh and collaborators
[44,45,47] also exhibit slow convergence. No resonance or
bound states have been reported by them. This makes
the critical comparison diﬃcult. Their singlet scattering
lengths calculated with diﬀerent basis states are always
greater than 5.20a0 of Campbell et al. [43] which demon-
strates only fair agreement with the variational results
[67,73]. However, they have recently emphasized the im-
portance of including the hydrogen states in a coupled-
channel calculation [47].

With an appropriate choice of the parameter C(=
0.784) in Eq.
(2.5) using a ﬁve-state coupled-channel
model Biswas and this author obtained 4.01 eV, 1.067 eV,
3.72a0 for the singlet Ps-H resonance and binding ener-
gies and scattering length [54,55], in better agreement
with the corresponding variational results: 4.0058 eV
[28], 1.064661 eV [38], and 3.49a0 [67], respectively. The
agreement with the variational singlet scattering length
of Ref. [73] is only fair. They fould that for obtaining
good convergence of resonance and binding energies the
inclusion of couple of hydrogen states in the expansion
scheme was essential. They also calculated total, par-
tial and diﬀerential cross sections at diﬀerent energies
[54,55]. The P-wave resonance of this model [55] at 5.08
eV agrees poorly with the calculation of Yan and Ho
[29]. However, this shows a correlated behavior among
the low-energy observables in the singlet S wave, which
is expected for an attractive eﬀective Ps-H interaction
of short-range. For an approximately ﬁxed range of the
eﬀective Ps-H interaction, using the classic idea of the
eﬀective-range expansion, the low-energy Ps-H problem
is expected to be determined by a single parameter – the
strength of interaction. This means that once this pa-

rameter is adjusted to ﬁt an observable of the low-energy
S-wave singlet Ps-H system, a satisfactory description of
other low-energy observables follows. As in the Ps-H sys-
tem there are no experimental results, we next consider
the problems of Ps-He and Ps-H2 scattering where the
above wisdom is turned to good advantage by ﬁtting a
low-energy data, e.g., the scattering cross section. Con-
sequently, the model presents a faithful representation of
Ps-He and Ps-H2 scattering at low and medium energies.

B. Ps-He System

There are no known resonance and bound state in the
Ps-He system. The variational results for the scattering
length are (1.0±0.1)a0 and 1.61a0 corresponding to zero-
energy cross sections of (4.0 ± 0.8)πa2
0 [66] and 10.4πa2
0
[73], respectively.

0 and by Fraser [24] yielded 14.2πa2

The static-exchange model by Sarkar and Ghosh [48],
and by Blackwood et al. [42] yielded 14.38πa2
0 (at 0.068
eV), and 14.58πa2
0 (at 0 eV), respectively, for the zero-
energy cross section. The inclusion of more states of Ps
in the CC [49] and R-matrix [42] calculations does not
change these results substantially. The static-exchange
calculations by Barker and Bransden [23] yielded 13.04
πa2
0 for zero-energy
Ps-He cross section. The 22-pseudo-Ps-state calculation
by McAlinden et al. yielded 13.193πa2
0. These results
are in good agreement with each other. However, in a re-
cent study Ghosh and collaborators [50,51] have argued
the importance of including excited He states in a CC
calculation. By including a couple of excited states of
He, they obtained a substantial reduction in the zero-
energy Ps-He cross section to 7.40 πa2
0 in good agree-
ment with a model potential calculation by Drachman
and Houston [27] which yielded 7.73πa2
0. The coupled-
channel model-potential calculation by this author [57]
yielded 3.34πa2
0 calculated with the parameter C = 0.84
for the zero-energy Ps-He cross section in agreement with
a variational result (4.0 ± 0.8)πa2
0 [66] and in total dis-
agreement with another 10.4πa2

0 [73].

Now we present a discussion of the results for Ps-He
total cross sections of the CC [49–51], R-matrix [42] and
model-potential [56,57] approaches shown in ﬁgure 1. In
the CC and model-potential approaches the Born cross
sections for Ps ionization and higher excitation of the
atom(s) are added to the result of the solution of the dy-
namical equation. In the 22-pseudo-state R-matrix ap-
proach the Ps excitation and ionization cross sections
are obtained from the solution of the dynamical equa-
tion. In ﬁgure 1 we also plot the diﬀerent experimental
cross sections [1,4,5,8,12] as well as diﬀerent zero-energy
theoretical [25,66,73] cross sections. Of the experimen-
tal cross sections, the total cross sections of Garner et
al [1,2] and Skalsey et al [4] can be accommodated in a
smooth graph. Once that is done it is diﬃcult to accom-
modate other experimental results in the same graph.

3

The model-potential cross section [56,57] is the only one
which is in agreement with the results of Garner et al [1,2]
and Skalsey et al [4] in the energy range 0 − 50 eV. The
22-pseudo-state R-matrix cross section [42] is in agree-
ment with the cross section of Nagashima et al [5] at low
energies. The CC cross section without He states [49] is
also in agreement with the cross section of Nagashima et
al at low energies. However, the CC cross section after in-
cluding few He states [50,51] is signiﬁcantly reduced and
is in agreement with the theoretical model calculation
of Ref. [25] and experimental cross sections of Coleman
et al [12] and Canter et al [8] at low energies. Of the
CC [49–51], R-matrix [42] and model-potential [56,57]
total cross sections the R-matrix result is unique in not
possessing a peak beyond the inelastic thresholds. The
combined experimental results of Refs. 1,3 exhibit such a
peak in the total cross section. To resolve the confusion
in the low-energy cross section of we consider below the
pickoﬀ quenching rate in Ps-He scattering.

As the eﬀective interaction for elastic scattering be-
tween Ps and He is repulsive in nature, a smaller scat-
tering length as obtained in in Refs. [56,57] would im-
ply a weaker eﬀective Ps-He interaction. The scattering
length of the R-matrix [42] and CC approaches with-
out He states [49] is 1.90 a.u., model-potential coupled-
channel approach [57] is 0.91 a.u., the CC approach with
few He states [50,51] is 1.36 a.u., and a model calculation
by Houston and Drachman [27] is 1.39 a.u. A small scat-
tering length as in the model-potential coupled-channel
approach [57] would imply a weaker ortho Ps-He interac-
tion and consequently, would allow the ortho Ps atom to
come closer to He which would lead [65] to a large pickoﬀ
quenching rate and a large 1Zeﬀ (∼ 0.11) in agreement
with experiment [7–11] as shown in ﬁgure 2, where we
plot 1Zeﬀ of diﬀerent theoretical approaches and com-
pare with experiment. The static-exchange model leads
to large low-energy cross sections and hence a much too
small 1Zeﬀ [23,24,21,65]. The CC [49] and R-matrix [42]
models also yield a much too large scattering length cor-
responding to a stronger repulsion between Ps and He.
Consequently, these models should lead to a much too
small 1Zeﬀ (∼ 0.04) in disagreement with experiment
[7–10]. This is addressed in detail in Ref. [65] where a
correlation between the diﬀerent scattering lengths and
the corresponding 1Zeﬀ is established. This correlation
suggests that a small Ps-He scattering length as obtained
in the model-potential [56,57] and variational [66] ap-
proaches is consistent with the large experimental 1Zeﬀ.

C. Ps-H2 System

The eﬀective Ps-H2 interaction is also repulsive in na-
ture and there are no known resonances in this system.
There are two theoretical calculations of cross section:
one using the Born-Oppenheimer approximation by Comi
et al [75], and the other using coupled-channel calcula-

4

tion with model potential [59,60]. The two experimental
results for total cross section in this case are due to Gar-
ner et al [1,2] and Skalsey et al [4] which can be combined
in a smooth curve, as can be found from ﬁgure 3. The
low-energy cross sections of Comi et al [75] are orders
of magnitude larger than experiment. The theoretical
total cross sections of Refs. [59,60] agree well with exper-
iment in the low- to medium-energy region for energies
less than 20 eV. In addition to the Ps(1s,2s,2p) excita-
tions included in the coupled-channel approach [59,60],
ionization and higher excitations of Ps and some excita-
u and b3Σ+
tions of H2 (B1Σ+
u states) [61] are included in
Refs. [59,60] using the ﬁrst Born approximation.

D. Ps-Ne and Ps-Ar Systems

The only dynamical calculation including exchange in-
teraction in these systems is the static-exchange calcu-
lation using the model potential [58]. The relevant ex-
perimental cross sections are reported by Zafar et al [3],
Skalsey et al [4], and Coleman et al [12]. In this case the
theoretical scattering length for Ps-Ar is 1.65 a.u., and
for Ps-Ne is 1.41 a.u. The approximate experimental
scattering length obtained by Coleman et al [12] for both
systems is 1.5 a.u. in reasonable agreement with theory.
The theoretical cross sections at low energies (0 to 5 eV)
are in good agreement with the low-energy experiment of
Skalsey et al [4].

E. Ps-alkali-metal Atom Systems

In Ps-alkali-metal atom systems so far there are no
experiments. The CC method has been applied in the
static-exchange [52] and two-Li-state models [53] for the
Ps-Li system. There has also been a CC calculation by
the Calcutta group reported at this workshop [76]. The
coupled-channel approach with model exchange potential
using Ps(1s,2s,2p) states has been applied successfully for
Ps-Li [62], Ps-Na, Ps-K [63], Ps-Rb, and Ps-Cs [64] scat-
tering. The CC calculation of Refs. [52,53] did not report
results for PsLi binding and resonances. The most inter-
esting aspects of the model potential calculation is the
prediction for resonance and binding energies in all the
Ps-alkali-metal atom systems as well as the cross sections.
In all cases resonances were reported in singlet S, P and
D waves near the lowest inelastic threshold. The bind-
ing energies of these model calculations are in agreement
with other theoretical calculations [77,78]. As no other
calculations or experiments are available for Ps scatter-
ing by these systems, we do not present a discussion of
these results here and refer the interested readers to ap-
propriate places.

F. Ps-Ps system

The model-potential [68] and the CC approaches [79]
have been used in the three-Ps-state model for this sys-
tem. There has also been elastic scattering results using
a variational method [73]. In the overall singlet state the
calculated scattering lengths are 7.46a0 [68], 5.85a0 [79],
and 8.4a0 [73] and those for spin-polarized ortho Ps ortho
Ps system are 1.56a0, −49.43a0, and 2.95a0, respectively.
The results of Refs. [73,68] are in reasonable agreement
with each other. The calculation of Ref. [79] has pro-
duced a scattering length of wrong sign corresponding to
an attraction between two spin-polarized ortho Ps atoms.
The model potential calculation is unique in predicting
resonances in the overall singlet channel in S and P waves
at 3.35 eV and 5.05 eV of widths 0.02 eV and 0.04 eV,
respectively [68]. Both the model-potential and the vari-
ational methods yield the correct result for Ps-Ps binding
[38,73,68]: 0.44 eV. The CC calculation underbinds the
Ps-Ps system by a factor of 2 and leads to a Ps-Ps binding
of 0.22 eV.

IV. SUMMARY AND FUTURE PERSPECTIVE

The experiments of Ps scattering by diﬀerent atoms
and molecules [1–5,8,12,6] have initiated a new era of
theoretical calculations of Ps scattering using R-matrix
[42,43], CC [44–49] and model exchange potential [54–59]
approaches in a coupled-channel framework. Of these,
the model potential approach has been the most success-
ful in a proper description of scattering in leading to total
cross sections of Ps scattering, specially at low energies,
in diﬀerent systems (Ps-H, Ps-He, Ps-Ne, Ps-Ar, and Ps-
H2) in better agreement with experiment and variational
calculations compared to the two other approaches. This
approach has also led to a better description of binding
and resonance energies in Ps-H, and Ps-alkali-metal atom
systems.

Much remains to be done in both theoretical and ex-
perimental fronts. More exact calculations of low-energy
elastic scattering are welcome. Experimentally, there are
only results of total cross sections. The data for partial,
diﬀerential, and ionization cross sections of Ps-He, and
Ps-H2 would help in the comparison of diﬀerent calcu-
lations and will clearly reveal which of the theoretical
approaches are providing a better description of Ps scat-
tering. It would be better to concentrate at low energies
below the lowest inelastic threshold, specially for Ps-He,
Ps-H2, Ps-Ne, Ps-Ar, and diﬀerent Ps-alkali-metal atom
systems. Precise measurements of Ps-He and Ps-H2 elas-
tic cross sections would provide a critical test for theo-
retical approaches. It would be also interesting to verify
if the prominent resonances in Ps-alkali-metal atom sys-
tems in Refs. [63,64] can be observed experimentally from
a measurement of cross section at low energies. Finally,
one should be prepared to undertake the challenging the-

oretical study of pickoﬀ quenching rates of ortho Ps in-
teraction with diﬀerent targets. The experimentalists are
far ahead in this topic [6,7]. There is enough homework
to be done till the next workshop.

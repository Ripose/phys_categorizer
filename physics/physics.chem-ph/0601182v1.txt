(Dated: February 2, 2008)

Coherent anti-Stokes Raman spectra (CARS) were obtained for CO2 in a positive column discharge. The
intensities of the Raman transitions to the ν1/2ν2 Fermi dyad decrease signiﬁcantly when the discharge is turned
on because of equalization of the lower and upper state populations by electron impact excitation, in a manner
similar to saturation. The strength of the 1285 cm−1 transition is observed to decrease by a factor of 20 greater
than the 1388 cm−1 line due to a quantum interference decreasing the vibrational relaxation rate of the upper
state of the 1285 cm−1 transition. This interference is veriﬁed by measurements of the decay rates from the
state. Experiments ruling out Stark effects and polarization effects are described. Supporting the observed rapid
vibrational excitation by electrons, a strong hot band transition 2000 ← 0220 at 1425.61 cm−1 was observed.
These observations are compared with recent measurements of the Raman spectra of CO2 heated in a ﬂame.

INTRODUCTION

ally independent simple harmonic oscillators of mass 1, to,

CO2 has been studied since the earliest days of both in-
frared and Raman spectroscopy. Rasetti wrote about the Ra-
man effect in gases [1] and selection rules in the Raman effect
[2] in 1929. He had noticed, in particular, that the Raman lines
observed in CO2 were quite different than expected, with two
lines instead of a single line. Fermi [3] described the origin
of these strong Q-branch lines which now bear his name in
1931. Discussions about quantum interference in transitions
between the states of CO2 waited until much later. Zhu et al.
[4], for example, wrote about quantum interference in the ex-
citation rates in 1991. Quantum interference effects are also
observable in relaxation and are the subject of this work.

II. THEORY

A. Anharmonicity in CO2

The Q-branches in CO2 at 1285 cm−1 and 1388 cm−1 are
the components of the Fermi dyad, a feature due to an “ac-
cidental” near degeneracy of one quanta of energy in sym-
metric stretch, ν1, with two quanta of energy in bend, 2ν2
[3]. Because these two frequencies are so close to each other
(δ = 7.87 cm−1 [5]) the states
strongly
perturb each other.

and

As Herzberg [6] shows, anharmonicities change the total
energy of a polyatomic molecule from the sum of 3N mutu-

where ηi are the normal coordinates of the motions. Thus, the
total energy is no longer the sum of independent (even though
anharmonic) oscillators.

In CO2 some of the coefﬁcients αijk and βijkl are equal
to zero because the potential energy must be unchanged for
all symmetry operations of the molecule’s point group, D∞h.
Additionally, symmetry operations allow the antisymmetric
normal coordinates to occur in Eqn. 1 only in even powers.
Of the ten unique cubic terms, then, only α111, α122, and α133
are non-zero and the cubic terms of the potential energy are,

α111η 3

1 + α122η1(η 2

2a + η 2

2b) + α133η1η 2
3 .

(2)

α122 is the term that generates the anharmonic coupling be-
tween ν1 and 2ν2 that gives the Fermi resonance.

Note that in Raman spectroscopy, the signal is proportional,
among other things, to the derivative of the polarizability with
respect to position at the equilibrium distance. Because of
this, the symmetric stretch normal mode (ν1) produces a Ra-
man signal, while bend (ν2) and assymetric stretch (ν3) are
Raman inactive.

B. Fermi Splitting in CO2

As Herzberg [6] also shows, in Fermi resonance the two
vibrational levels that have nearly the same energy in zero ap-
proximation (in CO2 ν1 and 2ν2) “repel” each other: one is
shifted up and the other is shifted down so that the separation
of the two levels is much greater than expected. In addition, a

mixing of the eigenfunctions of the two states occurs. The de-
viation of the energy levels from what is expected, as well as
the mixing of the eigenfunctions, become greater as the sepa-
ration of the zero approximation energies becomes smaller.

In addition to depending inversely on the separation of the
zero approximation energies, the magnitude of the repulsion
depends on the value of the corresponding matrix element
Wni of the perturbation function W :

Wni =

n W ψ 0∗

n and ψ 0

where W is essentially given by the anharmonic (cubic, quar-
tic, etc.) terms of the potential energy discussed in §II A and
ψ 0
i are the zero approximation eigenfunctions of the
two levels. Note that since W has the full symmetry of the
molecule, as mentioned above, ψ 0
i must both have
the same symmetry type in order for the integral in (3) to be
non-zero. This means that only vibrational levels of the same
symmetry can perturb each other. This can be seen in the en-
ergy level diagram, Fig. 1, where 1000 and 0200, both being
g, are involved in a Fermi resonance while 0220, being ∆g,

C. Notation Conventions

One of the problems in working with CO2 is the confu-
sion engendered by the profusion of state naming and nota-
tion conventions. Adel and Dennison [7] used the notation
(v1, v2, v3, ℓ), where ℓ is the vibrational angular momentum.
ℓ, v3). Amat and Pim-
Herzberg [6] used the notation (v1, v2
bert [8] used notation similar to Herzberg’s but introduced
the idea of using 1 and 2 as ranking indices to denote the
higher and lower-energy peaks of a Fermi dyad. Schr¨otter
and Brandm¨uller in Finsterh¨olzl et al. [9] used the notation of
Amat and Pimbert, but explicitly labeled states with the rank-
ing index. They, for example, labeled the 1388 cm−1 peak as
(1000)I and the 1285 cm−1 peak as (1000)II. They also la-
beled the 1410 hotband as (1110)I − (0110) and the 1265 hot-
band as (1110)II−(0110), keeping for the hotbands some indi-
cation of which levels are involved. Rothman and Young used
notation similar to that of Schr¨otter and Brandm¨uller in their
HITRAN (high resolution transmission) molecular absorp-
tion database intended for atmospheric physicists, but wrote
everything out on a single line suitable for a computerized
database [10]. In their notation, the 1388 cm−1 line is 10001
and the 1285 cm−1 line is 10002.

All this confusion is somewhat ameliorated by the “Rosetta
Stone” of notation in Rothman and Young’s 1981 paper on
carbon dioxide [11], reproduced below in Table I.

FIG. 1: Energy Levels of CO2. Energies of levels marked with an asterisk are uncertain. Strongest Raman transitions are marked by heavy
dotted lines.

As one progresses from Herzberg’s notation to the HI-
TRAN notation, it becomes increasingly difﬁcult to know
which exact levels are involved and the states involved in the
transition become hidden.

The vibrational energy levels of CO2 are shown in Fig. 1.
In this ﬁgure, the strongest Raman transitions of CO2 in the
wavenumber range examined are marked by heavy dotted
lines. Herzberg’s notation is used on the left to show the loca-
tions of where the states would be if they were not perturbed
by Fermi resonance. Some of the energy levels of these lines,
marked by asterisks, were given in Herzberg [6] but were not
given in any of the other references examined. Herzberg’s
(old) values of the energies did not make any sense consider-
ing Fermi resonance and the (new and more precise) observed
levels, which are plotted on the right according to Rothman’s
values [13] and marked with HITRAN notation, so the values
of these levels were manually adjusted to be more reasonable.
Note that in Fig. 1, the non-Fermi resonance inﬂuenced levels
of 0220, 0330, and 0440 are not plotted on the right side for
clarity.

III. EXPERIMENTAL APPARATUS AND CONDITIONS

The experimental setup used for this work, described previ-
ously in the literature [14], is shown in Fig. 2. The spectrom-
eter consists of a neodymium-YAG laser (using the second
harmonic output at λ = 532 nm), a tunable dye laser pumped
by part of the output of the YAG laser, optics to overlap both
spatially and temporally the remainder of the YAG laser’s out-
put (which is represented by the box labeled “Pump Laser” in
Fig. 2) with the output of the dye laser inside the sample vol-
ume, and optics to detect the newly created CARS beam com-
ing from the sample cell. A quartz block in a squeezing mech-
anism is used as a variable wave-plate (VWP) to adjust the po-
larization of the incident YAG beam. Fig. 2 also shows optics
and electronics for detection of Raman induced Kerr-effect
signals, which were used previously [14]. For this experiment,
the “pick-off” prism (P2 in Fig. 2), the double monochroma-
tor, and the photomultiplier tube (PMT) were added to detect
the coherent anti-Stokes Raman spectroscopy (CARS) signal.

necks down to an inner diameter of 0.375′′ over its central
16 inches. The smaller cross-section conﬁnes the glow dis-
charge and yields a higher current density. The ends of the in-
ner glass tube are open for mounting to stainless steel support
blocks at each end. The outer glass tube forms a water-cooling
jacket which cools not only the region of the discharge, but
also beyond the electrodes.

When running, the cell provides a long positive column
glow discharge which extends four to ﬁve inches on both sides
of the focus of the YAG and dye laser beams so the region
probed by the most intense portions of the focused laser beams
is within the positive column. At a current of 100 mA, the cur-
rent density is 1400 A/m2 (0.14 A/cm2).

IV. RESULTS

As can be seen in Fig. 4 and 5, both peaks of the Fermi
dyad drop when the discharge is turned on. Surprisingly, the
1285 cm−1 line drops much more than the 1388 cm−1 line.
This was true over broad ranges of both pressures and dis-
charge currents.

A. Drop of Both Fermi Dyad Peaks

The drop of both peaks when the discharge is turned on is
expected because the gas in the discharge is hotter and less
dense than the gas with no discharge. It is also vibrationally
heated, leading to the depletion of the ground state. In their
report of spontaneous Raman investigations of the pure rota-
tional lines in CO2 Barrett et al. [15] stated the intensity of
the lines with their discharge on (run at 10 mA and a pressure
of 40 Torr) was about 1
5 the intensity with the discharge off.
They calculated the temperature of their discharge (from the
strongest pure rotational line) to be 730 K.

In this experiment, such a measurement is not possible. The
temperature can be estimated, however, by calculating the rel-
ative signal strength of the 1285 cm−1 and 1388 cm−1 peaks
to the 1265 cm−1 and 1410 cm−1 hotband peaks as a func-
tion of temperature and then matching the ratio with what is
observed.

The population of a speciﬁc state is given by,

Ni = N

kT

gi e− Ei
Qv(T )

,

(8)

where, N is the total number of atoms, Ni, gi, and Ei are the
population, degeneracy factor, and the energy of the ith state
and Qv(T ) is the vibrational partition function.

The CARS signal is proportional to the square of the differ-
ence between two states, (∆N12)2, so the ratio of the intensity
of the ground state peaks to that of the hotband peaks is given
by,

The ratio of the summed areas of the 1285 cm−1 and
1388 cm−1 ground state peaks (7393) to the summed areas of
the 1265 cm−1 and 1410 cm−1 hotband peaks (172) is 42.983.
(Note that the baseline was manually placed for each peak to
compensate for the dispersive parts of the lineshapes.) Solv-
ing Eqn. 9 iteratively for T gives a discharge-on temperature
of 373 K (quite a bit lower than Barrett’s 730 K). Note that
this analysis assumes that the mechanisms exciting a molecule
from the ground state to one of the hotbands are in thermal
equilibrium with the mechanisms de-exciting from the hot-
band to the ground state. As will be shown in §IV C, this is an
invalid assumption.

Nevertheless, this increased temperature would be expected
to reduce the density and cause a drop of signal strength by
a factor of 1.60 but there is an additional contribution from
depletion of the ground state by vibrational heating. To cal-
culate this contribution, it is necessary to use Eqns. 8 and 9 to
calculate the exact ground state and excited state populations
for the discharge-off and discharge-on temperatures of 295 K
and 373 K. Since the exponentials in Qv rapidly become very
small only a limited number of terms are needed. This anal-
ysis uses the states shown in Fig. 1, all of which are below
3000 cm−1. The calculation shows the ground state popula-
tion decreasing from 92% of the molecules with the discharge

5

off to 67% of the molecules with the discharge on and 25%
of the molecules being shifted from the ground state to higher
states. Including the density factor with the vibrational heat-
ing, the 1285 cm−1 and 1388 cm−1 peaks should drop by a
factor of 1.9.

Since the 1285 cm−1 and 1388 cm−1 peaks decrease by
more than a factor of 19, much more than Barrett’s factor of
5, there is an additional source of decrease in (∆N12)2.

One of the possibilities is that the ground state is being
depopulated because the CO2 is being converted to other
molecules. Barrett, for example, considered that the drop in
signal might be due to the CO2 molecules being converted
+. He estimated the concentration of these ions in
to CO2
the discharge to be about 3 × 1011 ions/cm3, an insigniﬁ-
cant concentration compared to his gas density of 1018/cm3.
Mass spectrometric measurements of discharges have found
+, but the total concentrations were low
other ions, such as O2
[16, 17, 18, 19, 20]. This would also rule out large concentra-
tions of dissociation products.

B. Greater Drop of 1285 cm−1 Peak

In considering the greater drop of the 1285 cm−1 peak
(10002) than the 1388 cm−1 peak (10001), it must kept in
mind that the magnitude of the CARS signal depends upon
the square of the difference in population of the upper and
lower states. To have one peak drop more than the other, then,
the ratio of the differences in populations must be affected.
This suggests four possibilities:

• The transition rate is altered or the degeneracy of the

• Raman saturation of upper levels,

• The discharge saturates the ﬁnal state of the 1285 cm−1

transition, or,

perturbed states.

• The discharge changes the relaxation rates from the un-

Since both 10001 and 10002 begin in the ground state, it
is possible that the transition rate to 10002 is altered or the
near-degeneracy of the states 1000 and 0200 is changed. Such,
however, would require a shift of the wavenumber of the peaks
and none was observed (within a resolution of 0.2 cm−1)
when the discharge was turned on. No change in the ratio
of intensities of 10001 and 10002 was also observed when the
electric ﬁeld was applied without a discharge.

If the molecule is illuminated by strong enough laser
beams, the transition could be saturated with equal popula-
tions in the upper and lower states. To test this, the YAG laser
intensity was varied by an order of magnitude. No signiﬁcant
change in the ratio of intensities of 10001 and 10002 was ob-
served.

The third possibility is not as easily addressed as the ﬁrst
two. If the discharge saturates the population of 10002, its in-
tensity will be decreased relative to 10001. This would require

an electron excitation rate of |ψli in Eqn. 7 greater than that of
|ψui. Zhu et al. [4], however, observed exactly the opposite.
Their experimental setup was completely different than the
one used in this work and they worked at a much lower pres-
sure (27.5 milliTorr).

They produced translationally hot electrons, e−*, by multi-

photon ionization of iodine with an ArF laser at 193 nm:

I2 + n~ω(193nm) → I2

+ + e−* .

These translationally hot electrons then collided with CO2
molecules causing rotational and vibrational excitation of the
10001 and 10002 states. By tuning their diode laser, operat-
ing at (λ ≈ 4.3µm), they could probe speciﬁc rotational lines
of the CO2 molecules by absorption in the strongly allowed
ν3 (anti-symmetric stretch) infrared band using the transitions
1000 → 1001 and 0200 → 0201. They concluded that the
upper state, |ψui is signiﬁcantly more populated by electron
scattering than the lower state, |ψli, by a factor of 9.1 to 12.7,
depending on the particular J state examined.

are
nearly equal, Zhu’s results follow from these probabilities.
(cid:12)
The minus sign in the equation for |ψli then causes a “quan-
(cid:12)
tum interference” in its electron excitation rate, causing the
upper state of |ψli to have a lower population than the upper
state of |ψui. This is in contrast to the present observations
where |ψli’s weaker signal implies a higher population in its
upper state. Since one would expect that a change in popula-
tion that affects the infrared signal in one way would not affect
the CARS signal in another, there must be a difference in the
experiments to cause different results.

The difference is that Zhu et al. used “hot” electrons, a sig-
niﬁcant fraction of which had energies around 3 eV, while our
experiment produces mean electron energies on the order of
0.1 eV. Their higher energy electrons opened up an excitation
channel that was unavailable to the lower energy electrons of
this experiment.

Counting as separate the unperturbed states making up |ψli
and |ψui, there are four paths of excitation from the ground
state to |ψli and |ψui. As shown in Fig. 7, there are two direct
paths marked with the circled “1”,

0000 → 1000
0000 → 0200 ,

and two indirect paths marked with the circled “2”,

0000 → 0110 → 1000
0000 → 0110 → 0200 .

The single quantum, direct excitation of 1000 from 0000 oc-
curs most readily in the discharge. Mazevet et al. [21] showed

−. CO2

The double quantum, direct excitation of 0200 from 0000
−, which
is through the intermediate state of CO2
can have a lifetime as long as 90 µs in the gas phase [22],
has a bond angle of 134.9° [23]), so the bend vibration is
−. The potential
strongly excited through the decay of CO2
− are, however, roughly 3 eV higher
energy curves of CO2
than those of CO2 [24, 25], so this excitation channel was
open to Zhu et al. but closed in the present experiment.

Both indirect paths go through the singly excited bend state
0110 as an intermediate. Its excitation energy of 667 cm−1
(0.083 eV) is matched to the average electron energy in the
discharge. The second half of the ﬁrst indirect path, 0000 →
0110 → 1000, is a two quantum transition — it requires a
change of v1 from zero to one and a simultaneous change of
v2 from one to zero — whose probability is therefore low.
The second half of the second indirect path, 0000 → 0110 →
0200, is a single quantum transition and requires nearly the
same energy as the ﬁrst half of the indirect paths. It thus has a
high probability and is the route for excitation of 0200 in this
experiment.

The difference between the results seen by Zhu et al.’s ex-
periment and the present one is that Zhu et al. had direct ex-
citations from the ground state, 0000, to the ﬁnal state, |ψli
or |ψui, through two coherent channels, one exciting 1000
and the other exciting 0200. Because these two channels can
occur coherently during a single electron excitation process,
they saw interference between them and thus a lower exci-
tation probability for the production of |ψli. The present
experiment, using “cool” electrons, in contrast, has direct
excitation 0000 → 1000, but indirect, two-step excitation
0000 → 0110 → 0200. Since these two processes are inco-
herent there is no interference and the excitation probabilities
of |ψli and |ψui are similar, leading to the conclusion that the
discharge could not have preferentially saturated one of the
observed states.

The fourth and remaining possibility for explaining this re-
sult is that the discharge changes the relaxation rates from the
unperturbed states. Here the minus sign of |ψli in Eqn. 7 does

explain what was seen.
If turning on the discharge causes
the transition rates for the unperturbed states, 1000 and 0200,
to become more equal, the quantum interference engendered
by the minus sign in Eqn. 7 will cause |ψli to have a much
smaller relaxation rate to the lower levels, 0110 and 0000,
than |ψui. (It can readily be seen that the relaxation rates can
be different between discharge on and discharge off because
when the discharge is off, relaxation occurs by spontaneous
emission and inelastic collisions with molecules and the walls
(collision induced emission). When the discharge is turned
on, relaxation additionally occurs by inelastic and superelas-
tic collisions with free electrons and ion and electron charge
( ~E ﬁeld) induced emission.)

The signiﬁcant drop of the 1285 cm−1 peak can thus be
explained by the discharge causing changes in the relaxation
rates from the unperturbed states and saturating the state |ψli.
Note that the majority of observed drop of the 1388 cm−1 line
could also be due to the state |ψui being partially saturated by
the discharge.

To test this hypothesis, the change of 1285 cm−1 and
1388 cm−1 CARS signals as a function of time after the dis-
charge was turned off was measured for pressures between 0.8
to 4 Torr. These data are graphed in Fig. 8 and 9.

FIG. 8: Rise of 1285 cm−1 signal of CO2 with turn-off of discharge.

For a pressure of 1.6 Torr, for example, the 1388 cm−1
signal increased as an exponential with a time constant τ ≈
2.0 ± 0.3 s. The increase in signal is due to both the decrease
of population in |ψui and the repopulation of the ground state
from other levels by collisions. This vibrational relaxation
time for repopulating the ground state decreases with increas-
ing pressure as expected.

Under the same conditions, the growth of the 1285 cm−1
signal due to |ψli exhibits a double-exponential behavior
whose shorter time constant is consistent with the repopula-
tion of the ground state. These data are re-plotted in Fig. 10
with the curve ﬁt. The results of this analysis are consistent
with the model of quantum interference altering the vibra-
tional relaxation rate from |ψli compared with that from |ψui.
Others have measured relaxation rates from CO2 states
their results are not applicable to this experiment.

selectively excited the molecules with a doubled-YAG/dye
laser setup similar to the one used in the present work —
though theirs achieved narrow-band dye operation with an ar-
gon laser pumped CW dye oscillator. They measured the vi-
brational relaxation rate versus pressure from the 1388 cm−1
peak. Since the 1388 cm−1 peak is very narrow the rotational
lines blend at low pressures (0.006 amagat, 5 Torr). Because
of this, they excited all of the rotational lines, which lead
to achieving rotational equilibrium more rapidly and mak-
ing the vibrational relaxation more efﬁcient. They were able
to resolve the 1285 cm−1 Q-branch and used that to mea-
sure the rotational relaxation rate versus pressure from that
state. Unfortunately, they do not give the vibrational relax-
ation rate from the 1285 cm−1 peak and do not give any
results for CO2 in a discharge. Dang et al. [27] measured

the relaxation times of CO2 vibrational levels in a discharge.
They disturbed the discharge-on equilibrium with a CO2 laser
pulse and then watched as that equilibrium was re-established
with the discharge remaining on. In this experiment, in con-
trast, the discharge-on relaxation rates are compared with the
discharge-off relaxation rates and a change in the rates when
the discharge is turned on is what causes the 1285 cm−1 peak
to drop more than the 1388 cm−1 peak.

C. Visibility of Saturation of |ψli in Spectra

If, as posited in the previous section, the 1285 cm−1 signal
drops more than the 1388 cm−1 signal because its lower re-
laxation rate causes a saturation of the upper level of the tran-
sition, that saturated upper level should then be the lower level
of hotband transitions that appear when the discharge is turned
on. The possible transitions out of both the 1285 cm−1 and
1388 cm−1 states with energies similar to those of the present
investigation are shown in Table II. Of the ten candidates,

six are within the 1245 cm−1 to 1430 cm−1 range exam-
ined experimentally. Of these six, the three from 1285 cm−1
should be stronger than the three from 1388 cm−1. In addi-
tion, two of the transitions (12201 ← 10001 at 1372.54 cm−1
and 12202 ←10002 at 1299.61 cm−1) involve the change of
only the number of quanta of the bend vibration, ν2. As men-
tioned in §II A, the ν2 vibration is Raman inactive and so,
absent any concomitant change in the symmetric stretch (ν1)
quantum number or Fermi mixing, should not be visible at all.
The baselines of many discharge-on spectra were examined
for evidence of lines at these wavenumbers. Of the six candi-
dates, 1299.61 cm−1, 1385.73 cm−1, and 1408.95 cm−1 sug-
gest the possibilities of lines.

The spectrum examined previously for computation of the
temperature of the discharge (Fig. 6) is reproduced in Fig. 11
with an arrow pointing at the possible line at 1299.61 cm−1,
heavily inﬂuenced by noise. Its weakness is not surprising in
view of the Raman inactivity of the transition.

Fig. 12 shows the region of the 1388 cm−1 Q-branch with
the solid arrow pointing at the possible line at 1385.73 cm−1.
The weakness of this line is surprising given the degree of
saturation expected for the upper state of the 1285 cm−1 Q-
branch, |ψli, though it could be explained by a small Raman

the cross-products between a line and its neighbors and be-
tween a line and the background inherent in the |χ (3)|2 probed
by CARS destructively interfere and reduce the strength of the
line.

Fig. 13 shows a comparison of the no discharge and
100 mA discharge spectra of 11101 ← 01101 hotband at
1409.476 cm−1. Note that the discharge on peak is broader
and is less symmetric than the discharge off peak, being
shaded to the lower energy side, where the 20001 ← 10001
hotband would be.
In contrast to the amplitude of the
1385 cm−1 line just discussed, here there is no question that
the cross-products in the |χ (3)|2 change the shape and place-
ment of the lines. This effect could be avoided by using
RIKES instead of CARS. Since this line arises from the up-
per state of the 1388 cm−1 Q-branch, |ψui, its weakness is
expected.

charge was on, there were repeatable, clearly resolvable lines
at 1366, 1424, and 1426 cm−1. These lines are marked in
Fig. 12 with hollow arrows. From Rothman’s data [13], the
1366 cm−1 line is due to the transition 10011 ← 00011, the
1424 cm−1 line to 21101 ← 11101, and the 1426 cm−1 line
to 12201 ← 02201, where 02201 is the two quanta bend
vibrational state with two quanta of vibrational angular mo-
mentum that is not involved in Fermi resonance with 10001.
Though hotband transitions directly from the saturated 10001
and 10002 states are not observed, the strong hotband from
02201 only 50 cm−1 away suggests large populations of all
three levels. This validates the saturation model.

Note that in Fig. 12, the amplitude of the line at 1424 cm−1
(which originates from the 02201 state at 1335.15 cm−1) is
greater than that of the line at 1410 cm−1 (which originates
from the 01101 state at 667.3799 cm−1), whereas a Boltzman
distribution at 373 K would require the opposite. This indi-
cates that the gas temperature calculated in §IV A from the ra-
tio of the populations is incorrect, that the vibrational energy
of the molecules is not in thermal equilibrium with the tem-
perature of the gas but is more on the order of the temperature
of the electrons, which for energies of 0.1 – 0.2 eV is roughly
1000 – 2000 K. This is not surprising because the molecules
are excited to upper levels by electron impact while they are
de-excited back to the ground state by collisions with other
molecules. In fact, with separate processes, one would be sur-
prised if the excitation and de-excitation rates were equal and

thermal equilibrium were achieved.

In contrast to the very selective population of upper lev-
els by electron impact evident in low pressure spectra, spectra
taken at higher pressures show a much more thermal distribu-
tion. In Fig. 14, the intensities of the excited state lines show
a monotonic decrease in strength, exactly what one would ex-
pect from a Boltzman distribution and similar to what has been
shown previously for work in ﬂames [28] and in furnaces [29];
the quantum interference in the 1285 and 1388 cm−1 lines is
still apparent.

Quantum interference is present in other transitions of CO2
as well. Table II shows that a line at 1511 cm−1 due to the
transition 20001 ← 10002 should be observed. Since this
transition is due to an increase of the Raman-active symmet-
ric stretch quantum number, one would expect it to be quite
visible. Experimentally, however, this line is not seen, even in
spectra at 40 Torr. In this case, the level 20001 is composed
of the states 2000 + 1200 + 0400 and the level 10002 is com-
posed of the states 1000 − 0200. Here excitation by the path
1200 ← 0200 (with the minus sign) interferes with excitation
by the path 2000 ← 1000 and the total excitation probability
vanishes. It is also interesting to note that the 1409 cm−1 hot-
band, perhaps seen only as a broadening in Fig. 13, is more
distinct as a separate peak in Fig. 14.

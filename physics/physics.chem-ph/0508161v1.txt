It is generally believed that the old quantum theory, as presented by Niels Bohr in 1913, fails
when applied to few electron systems, such as the H2 molecule. Here we ﬁnd new solutions within
the Bohr theory that describe the potential energy curve for the lowest singlet and triplet states of
H2 about as well as the early wave mechanical treatment of Heitler and London. We also develop a
new interpolation scheme which substantially improves the agreement with the exact ground state
potential curve of H2 and provides a good description of more complicated molecules such as LiH,
Li2, BeH and He2.

The Bohr model [1] for a one-electron atom played a
major historical role and still oﬀers pedagogical appeal.
However, when applied to the simple H2 molecule, the
“old quantum theory” proved unsatisfactory [2, 3]. Here
we show that a simple extension of the original Bohr
model describes the potential energy curves E(R) for the
lowest singlet and triplet states about as well as the ﬁrst
wave mechanical treatment due to Heitler and London
[4].

We ﬁnd the Bohr model of H2 admits other solutions
than the symmetric one he considered (pictured in Fig.
1) [5]. These provide a fairly good description of the
ground state E(R) (curve 2 in Fig. 3) at large as well as
small internuclear spacing R, in contrast with the result
of Bohr (curve 1 in Fig. 3).

Clearly the Bohr picture of a molecule goes wrong at
large R. Any realistic model must show the ground state
potential energy function dissociating to H+H. Sommer-
feld, in his seminal book [3], provided an apt assessment:
“We shall now describe a little more fully the model that
Bohr has suggested for the constitution of the hydrogen
molecule H2, although, nowadays, we can take only a
historical interest in it.” After some discussion he asks:
“But is it correct?” To which he answers: “Only a short
while ago, even while this book was in its ﬁrst edition,
we were inclined to accept it”. And later he concludes:
“Thus the true model of the H2 molecule is still unknown.
It will hardly be as symmetrically built as the model ex-
hibited in Fig. 22”. His Fig. 22 is the same as our
symmetric conﬁguration in Fig. 3.

It is somewhat ironic that the Bohr picture of the
molecule never caught on. As with the Bohr atomic pic-
ture, it contains valuable insight, and can provide a good
analytical description of molecular behavior. Sommer-
feld even sensed that the symmetric conﬁguration was
suspect. In Fig. 3 we present a simple continuation of
the line of thought that Bohr was following which is in-
deed asymmetric and provides a good quantitative pic-
ture of H2 at small and large R. We next outline Bohr’s
insightful picture and our extensions.

Figure 2 displays the Bohr model

for a hydrogen
molecule, in which two nuclei with charges Z|e| are sep-
arated by a ﬁxed distance R (adiabatic approximation)
and the two electrons move in the space between them.
The model assumes that the electrons move with con-
stant speed on circular trajectories of radii ρ1 = ρ2 = ρ.
The circle centers lie on the molecule axis z at the coor-
dinates z1 = ±z2 = z. The separation between the elec-
trons is constant. The net force on each electron consists
of three contributions: attractive interaction between an
electron and the two nuclei, the Coulomb repulsion be-
tween electrons, and the centrifugal force on the electron.
We proceed by writing the energy function E = T + V ,
where the kinetic energy T = p2
2/2m for electrons
1 and 2 can be obtained from the quantization condition
that the circumference is equal to the integer number n
of the electron de Broglie wavelengths 2πρ = nh/p, so
that we have T = p2/2m = n2¯h2/2mρ2. All distances we
express in terms the Bohr length a0 = ¯h2/me2, where m
is the electron mass, and take e2/a0 as a unit of energy.

Possible electron conﬁgurations correspond to extrema

g , and the lowest triplet state, 3Σ+

In Fig. 3 (lower panel) we plot E(R) for the four Bohr
model conﬁgurations (solid curves), together with “ex-
act” results (dots) obtained from extensive variational
wave mechanical calculations for the singlet ground state
1Σ+
u [7]. In the model,
the three conﬁgurations 1, 2, 3 with the electrons on op-
posite sides of the internuclear axis (φ = π) are seen to
correspond to singlet states, whereas the other solution
4 with the electrons on the same side (φ = 0) corre-
sponds to the triplet state. At small internuclear dis-
tances, the symmetric conﬁguration 1 originally consid-
ered by Bohr agrees well with the “exact” ground state
quantum energy; at larger R, however, this conﬁguration

climbs far above the ground state and ultimately disso-
ciates to the doubly ionized limit, 2H++2e. In contrast,
the solution for the asymmetric conﬁguration 2 appears
only for R > 1.20 and in the large R limit dissociates to
two H atoms. The solution for asymmetric conﬁguration
3 exists only for R > 1.68 and climbs steeply to dissoci-
ate to an ion pair, H++H−. The asymmetric solution 4
exists for all R and corresponds throughout to repulsive
interaction of two H atoms.

The simplistic Bohr model provides surprisingly accu-
rate energies for the ground singlet state at large and
small
internuclear distances and for the triplet state
over the full range of R. Also, the model predicts the

(bottom) in H2 molecule. The nuclei Z are ﬁxed at a distance
R apart. The two electrons rotate about the internuclear axis
z with coordinates ρ1, z1 and ρ2, z2 respectively; the dihedral
angle φ between the (ρ1, z1) and (ρ2, z2) planes remains con-
stant at either φ = π or φ = 0. The sketch corresponds to
conﬁguration 2 of Fig. 3, with φ = π.

ground state is bound with an equilibrium separation
Re ≈ 1.10 and gives the binding energy as EB ≈ 0.100
a.u.= 2.73 eV. The Heitler-London calculation, obtained
from a two-term variational function, obtained Re = 1.51
and EB = 3.14 eV [4], whereas the “exact” results are
Re = 1.401 and EB = 4.745 eV [7, 9]. For the triplet
state, as seen in Fig. 3, the Bohr model gives remark-
ably close agreement with the “exact” potential curve
and is in fact much better than the Heitler-London re-
sult (which, e.g., is 30% high at R = 2). One should
mention that in 1913, Bohr found only the symmetric
conﬁguration solution, which fails drastically to describe
the ground state dissociation limit. Although a variety of
modiﬁcations were later considered [2, 10], to our knowl-
edge the other three solutions of the simplest model have
never been discussed in the literature. One should cer-
tainly pay tribute to Bohr’s planetary model proposed
long before the development of quantum mechanics. It
is somewhat ironic that the Bohr model can be derived
from quantum mechanics in the limit of large dimensions
[11].

We conclude this ﬁrst portion of our paper with a quick
sketch of the way the calculations are carried out in order
to emphasize how simple the present analysis is, as com-
pared to the many particle Schr¨odinger equation. For ex-
ample, for the conﬁguration 2, with z1 = −z2 = z, φ = π,
the extremum equations ∂E/∂z = 0 and ∂E/∂ρ = 0 read

which are seen to be equivalent to Newton’s second law
applied to the motion of each electron. Eq. (3) speciﬁes
that the total Coulomb force on the electron along the
z−axis is equal to zero; Eq. (4) speciﬁes that the pro-
jection of the Coulomb force toward the molecular axis
equals the centrifugal force. At any ﬁxed internuclear
distance R, these algebraic equations determine the con-
stant values of ρ and z that describe the electron tra-

jectories. Substituting these values back into Eq.

FIG. 5: Ground state E(R) of H2 molecule calculated within
the interpotated Bohr model (solid line) and the “exact” en-
ergy (dots) [8]. Insert shows E(R) with no 1/R term. Curves
1 and 2 are obtained based on the quantization relative to
the molecular axis (small R) and the nearest nuclei (large R)
respectively. Dashed line is the interpolation between two
regions.

in Fig. 3, this yields a quite accurate description of the
H2 ground state E(R) at small R, but becomes less accu-
rate at larger internuclear separation. An improvement
emerges from the following observation. At large R each
electron in H2 feels only the nearest nuclear charge. Ac-
cordingly, as R → ∞, we have two weakly interacting,
neutral H atoms. Therefore, at large R quantization of
the momentum relative to the nearest nuclei, rather than
to the molecular axis yields a better description of the
physics. This leads to the following expression for the
energy of the H2 molecule

For n1 = n2 = 1 and R > 2.8 the expression (6) has
a local minimum for the asymmetric conﬁguration 2 of
Fig. 3. We plot the corresponding E(R) without the 1/R
term in the insert of Fig. 5 (curve 2). At R < 2.8 the
local minimum disappears and electrons collapse into the
opposite nuclei. At small R we apply the quantization
condition relative to the molecular axis which yields the
curve 1 in Fig. 5. To ﬁnd E(R) at intermediate sep-
aration we smoothly connect the two regions by a third
order polynomial (dashed line). Addition of the 1/R term
yields the ﬁnal potential curve, plotted in Fig. 5. This
simple interpolated Bohr model provides good agreement
with the “exact” potential curve over the full range of R.
Next we consider the Li2 molecule. If we neglect inner
shell electrons of Li then the Li2 molecule becomes similar
to an excited state of H2 with n1 = n2 = n = 2 in Eq. (6).

yields E(R). Similar force equations describe the other
extremum conﬁgurations.

The simple Bohr model is also useful in describing
more complicated diatomic molecules. For N electrons
the model reduces to ﬁnding conﬁgurations that deliver
extrema of the energy

E =

+ V (r1, r2, ..., rN , R),

In such a formulation of the model there is no need to
specify electron trajectories and also incorporate non-
stationary electron motion. One can obtain the energy
function (5) from dimensional scaling analysis of the
Schr¨odinger equation in large-D limit [11]. This provides
a link between the old (Bohr-Sommerfeld) and the new
(Heisenberg-Schr¨odinger) quantum mechanics.

Next we discuss the ground state potential curve of
HeH. To incorporate the Pauli exclusion principle one
can use a prescription based on the sequential ﬁlling of
the electron levels. In the case of HeH the three electrons
cannot occupy the same lowest level of HeH++. There-
fore, for the conﬁguration with n1 = n2 = n3 = 1, the
true ground state energy corresponds to a saddle point
rather than to a global minimum. Such a conﬁguration
is pictured in Fig. 4 (insert). In order to obtain the cor-
rect dissociation limit we assign the helium nucleus an
eﬀective charge Z eﬀ
He = 1.954. Fig. 4 shows the ground
state potential curve of HeH in the Bohr model (solid
curve) and the “exact” result (dots) obtained from ex-
tensive variational wave mechanical calculations [8]. The
Bohr model gives remarkably close agreement with the
“exact” potential energy curve.

We have found a simple means to improve signiﬁcantly
the Bohr model results for bound electronic states. The
original model assumes quantization of the electron an-
gular momentum relative to the molecular axis. As seen

Hence, the ground state potential curve of Li2 can be
obtained from the ground state E(R) of H2 using the
following relation

(cid:2)
The result is shown in Fig. 6 (solid line). For Li2 the Bohr
model gives the binding energy EB = 1.10 eV which is
very close to the “exact” value of EB = 1.05 eV.

(cid:3)

As an example of application of the extended Bohr
model to other diatomic molecules, we discuss the ground
state E(R) of LiH. The Li atom contains three electrons
two of which ﬁll the inner shell. Only the outer electron
with the principal quantum number n = 2 is important
in formation of the molecular bond. Applying a similar
approach to that used to obtain Fig. 5, we ﬁnd E(R) for
LiH as shown in Fig. 7 (solid line), while dots are the
“exact” numerical answer. This simple extension of the
Bohr model provides a good quantitative description of
the LiH potential curve. In this treatment, the essential
diﬀerence from H2 arises simply because in LiH the n = 2
electron from Li is much more weakly bound than the n =
1 electron from H, with the result that for LiH the binding
energy is twofold less than for H2 and the equilibrium
separation roughly twice as large. As seen in Fig. 8,
the same procedure also gives a good potential curve for
BeH, a relatively complex ﬁve electron system.

FIG. 8: Ground state energy E(R) of BeH molecule calcu-
lated within the interpotated Bohr model (solid line) and the
“exact” energy (dots). Insert shows the electron conﬁguration
at large R; only outer shell Be electrons are displayed.

Finally we show how our very simple analysis yields
very accurate potential curve for the He2 molecule. We
apply the Bohr model with momentum quantization rel-
ative to the nearest nuclei and assume the electron con-
ﬁguration as shown in the insert of Fig. 9. Then the
problem reduces to ﬁnding minimum of the following en-

Minimization of this simple expression at ﬁxed R leads

The curve essentially passes through the “exact” dots
over the full range of R.

In conclusion, we ﬁnd a simple extension of the Bohr
molecular model which gives a clear physical picture of
how electrons create chemical bonding. At the same
time, the description is surprisingly accurate providing
good potential energy curves for relatively complex many
body systems.

that Bohr and his students were not aware of the other

Bohr says in his hand written notes [6]: “The model pro-
posed for H2 seems to be the only possible equilibrium
ﬁguration of 2 kerns and 2 electrons (looking apart from
two separate atoms), in which the kerns are at rest”. Fur-
thermore, Sommerfeld [3] was clearly unaware of the key

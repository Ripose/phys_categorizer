Abstract

Various models leading to predictions of negative capacitance, C, are
brieﬂy reviewed. Their relation to the nature of electric control is dis-
cussed. We reconﬁrm that the calculated double layer capacitance can
be negative under σ-control - an artiﬁcial construct that requires uniform
distribution of the electrode surface charge density, σ. For instance, It is
shown that the combined relaxation of the ionic and electronic contribu-
tions can result in C < 0 even for the local statistical ionic models with
strictly positive diﬀuse layer capacitance.
In reality, however, only the
total charge q (or the average surface charge density σ) can be experi-
mentally ﬁxed in isolated cell studies (q-control). For those σ where C
becomes negative under σ-control, the transition to q-control (i.e. relaxing
the lateral change density distribution, ﬁxing its mean value to σ) leads to
instability of the uniform distribution and a transition to a non-uniform
phase. As an illustration, a ”membrane capacitor” model is discussed.
This exactly solvable model, allowing for both uniform and inhomoge-
neous relaxation of the electrical double layer, helps to demonstrate both
the onset and some important features of the instability. Possibilities for
further development are discussed brieﬂy.

1 Introduction

The question of the admissible sign of the diﬀerential capacitance at charged
interfaces and its relation to thermodynamic stability has a long and dramatic
history. It emerged in early 1970s with the so called Cooper-Harrison catastro-
phe [?], an apparent prediction of C < 0 for ”dipolar capacitors”- lattices of
reorientable dipoles between conductive plates. Soon thereafter, similar anoma-
lies were predicted for some ionic double layer models [?, ?]. In the mid-1980s

1

interest in this problem was renewed due to predictions of C < 0 for microscopic
”relaxing gap capacitor” (RGC) models (see [?, ?, ?, ?] and references therein)
which accounted for the metal electron contributions and the corresponding re-
laxation of the ”electronic plate” of the interfacial capacitor with charging. It
is accepted that C must be strictly positive for open ”φ-controlled” systems,
where the electric cell is connected to a source of controllable voltage [?]. How-
ever, it was shown that C < 0 is possible as a stable state of an isolated RGC if
electric control is maintained by a macroscopically uniformly distributed sur-
face charge density σ, so called σ-control (see [?, ?, ?] for review). Prior to this
discovery, an attempt had been made to prove, on general statistical-mechanical
grounds, that for an equilibrium σ-controlled system C must be strictly posi-
tive [?]. Somewhat later improved analysis
[?, ?, ?, ?, ?] showed the model
[?] does not forbid negative C values. For both ionic and ”relaxing gap capaci-
tor” models, which together cover a very wide range of interfacial phenomena,
the equilibrium capacitance under σ-control can be negative. This is true for
both the ”compact layer” capacitance and the total double layer capacitance,
including the ”diﬀuse” layer contributions [?, ?].

Here we show, that though acceptable for σ-control, which implies a uniform
charge density on the ”electrode,” negative EDL capacitance is not possible for
a real isolated system, where uniformity of σ is not enforceable and only the
total electrode charge can be ﬁxed. In other words, we show that in σ domains
where C is negative under σ-control, the system is unstable with respect to
transition to an inhomogeneous state with nonuniform lateral distributions of
the electrode charge density and of mobile electrolyte ions. To demonstrate this
anomaly, we discuss a transparent ”membrane capacitor” model, which exhibits
a C < 0 domain presuming uniformity (an elastic slab with plane surfaces and
uniform surface charge) while becoming unstable in this domain if non-uniform
surface charge distributions and membrane deformations are considered.

This result addresses questions raised recently [?, ?] with respect to the
meaning and physical reality of C < 0 for the isolated capacitor. Our analysis
suggests that a model demonstrating this anomaly under σ-control can be used
to study transition to an inhomogeneous interfacial state under q-control.

2 Control of electriﬁed interfaces - theory and

experiment

1. Experimental study of the electrical double layer (EDL) at electrochemical in-
terfaces is usually conducted under ”potential” (φ-) control, where electrodes are
connected to a voltage source. Changing the applied voltage in increments ∆φ
leads to corresponding changes of the electrode charge, ∆q. Similarly, controlled
modulation of the voltage, φ = φ(t), results in charge modulation measurable
by impedance techniques. Connection to a potentiostat, required to maintain
φ-control, results in an open system, which is treated by grand canonical meth-
ods.

2

The diﬀerential capacitance (per unit area) is then deﬁned by the derivative

where the average surface charge density is σ = q/A and A is the the surface
area of the electrode. The form of Eq. 1 is a typical response function

Cφ = ∂φσ

κF = ∂F X

(1)

(2)

where F is the external parameter (”force”) and X the conjugate intensive
variable.

2. The electrical properties of interfaces can equally well be studied by
controlling the electrode charge, q. In q-control the measured quantity is the
corresponding potential φ. Charge can be regulated by connecting the electrodes
to a battery for brief periods of time ∆t, measuring the current j, with the charge
increments found by ∆q = j∆t. With q ﬁxed, the resultant φ is measured in an
isolated system, i.e. a canonical ensemble.

The corresponding response function, analogous to Eqs. 1 and 2 is the

inverse diﬀerential capacitance

C−1

q = ∂σφ.
Obviously, q-control is a synonym for σ-control: ﬁxing the total charge q is equiv-
alent to ﬁxing the average surface charge density σ. The thermodynamic poten-
tials of the expanded (φ-controlled ) system, Aφ,and the isolated (q-controlled)
system, Aq, are related by the Legendre transformation,

(3)

Aφ(σ, φ) = Aq(σ) − qφ.

(4)

3. Most calculations of the electric double layer (EDL) assume the electrode,
often described as a charged ﬂat wall, has a uniform, ﬁxed charge density. This
is eﬀectively σ-control, which is generally not equivalent to q- (or σ-) control.
The terms are interchangeable only if the equilibrium surface charge density
if σ = σ = const. A
is uniform on a scale exceeding atomic dimensions, i.e.
counter-example is one where the optimized local charge density is non-uniform
in the electrode plane, σ = σ(rs) 6= σ (rs is the radius vector in the electrode
plane), reminiscent of ”charge density wave” states in electron plasma. In prac-
tice there is no way to control the local charge density; in isolated systems only
the total charge can be constrained externally. σ-control is a purely theoretical
construct; its predictions must be tested to determine if a uniform surface charge
density and its corollary, a laterally-uniform ionic distribution correspond to a
real equilibrium state.

3 Admissible sign of the diﬀerential capacitance

3.1 φ-control: the open system

General thermodynamic [?] and statistical-mechanical [?] treatments of elec-
triﬁed interfaces show that, under φ-control, diﬀerential capacitance must be

3

strictly positive. In our view attempts to circumvent this restriction [?, ?, ?]
have been based on misinterpretations of the nature of potential control [?, ?].
Near a critical voltage φcr, deﬁned by C−1(φcr) = 0, the system becomes un-
stable. The transition to a new state is accompanied by charge ﬂow from the
potentiostat to the electrodes, a sort of electrical ”breakdown” (see [?, ?, ?]
for more details), which would be a unique path to phase transformation as-
suming lateral uniformity. However, as discussed below, the transition can also
involve formation of a laterally non-uniform phase accompanied by nonuniform
redistribution of the electrode charge density σ(ρ).

As the requirement that Cφ > 0 is now generally accepted, we turn to
treating isolated systems. The sense of the upcoming discussion is already
implicit, once having recognized that the ﬁrst of these instabilities is forbidden
by the very deﬁnition of ”q-control” since, once q is ﬁxed, electric contact with
the potentiostat must be interrupted. Can C be negative under this constraint?
As the admissible sign of C in isolated systems has almost always been analyzed
in σ-control terms, we ﬁrst consider this case and postpone discussion of the
more general q-control.

3.2 σ-control in the isolated system

3.2.1 Primitive models of electrolytes

Interest in the admissible sign of C in the theory of the diﬀusive layer was
stimulated by work of Blum, Lebowitz and Henderson [?]. They tried to provide
a rigorous restriction on the sign of C for ”primitive ionic models:” charged hard
ions in a uniform dielectric medium between two rigid, uniformly charged walls.
The corresponding Hamiltonian is quite generally [?]

H(σ, {R}) =

− σf ({R}) + H

({R})

(5)

′

σ2d
2εε0

where {R} refers to a particular conﬁguration of the system (charge coordi-
nates, dipolar orientations, etc.). The ﬁrst term describes direct interaction
between the charged walls, with d the inter-wall distance. σf ({R}) accounts
for interaction between the electrolyte and the electrode ﬁeld (the physical sig-
niﬁcance of f will be clear shortly) and H ′ is a σ independent interaction energy.
The potential drop between the charged plates is

from redistribution of free (ionic) charges shielding the applied ﬁeld, and from
repositioning of the bound charges ( the reorientation of molecular dipoles).

For Hamiltonians of the type of Eq. 5 the capacitance satisﬁes the general

condition [?]

C−1 =

−

A
kT

(< f 2 > − < f >2),

leading to a simple and self-evident result:

(7)

(8)

C−1 ≤

d
εε0

.

Eq. 8 simply means that redistribution of free charges and molecular polar-
ization induced by the electric ﬁeld in the electrolyte reduce the potential drop
between the electrodes and increase the capacitance C, a condition that places
no constraints on the sign of C under σ-control. One should note here that if
the distance d >> λD, the characteristic Debye length in the electrolyte, then
the total inverse capacitance of the cell splits into two independent double layer
contributions belonging to two ”electrodes:”

C−1 = C−1

1 + C−1
2 .

If the sign of the total cell capacitance C is unrestricted under σ-control, this is
even more true for the individual double layer contributions, C1 and C2.

Eq. 7 (Eq. 24 of [?]) was derived in a study of a ”dipolar capacitor”
(”DC”), a lattice of point dipoles embedded between the plates of a parallel-
plate capacitor, a model often used for analyzing a compact layer at metal-
solvent interfaces. For the DC

is the potential drop corresponding to an arbitrary conﬁguration of the molec-
ular dipoles with Pz the average surface density of the dipole moment in the
lattice and pi,z the projection of the individual dipole moment normal to the
surface of the lattice.

If interaction between the charged walls (the ﬁrst contribution to the Hamil-
tonian, Eq. 5) were properly included in the Hamiltonian of the primitive ionic
model [?], it would also lead to Eq. 7 (see p. 68 of [?]) with

f = fion = −

where qi
is the charge of i-th ion and zi its distance from the charged wall po-
sitioned at z = 0. Eq. 7 and its analogs have been repeatedly derived and
discussed [?, ?, ?]; they hold for any model in which the electrodes are treated
as hard charged walls with distinctly separate regions occupied by electrode and
electrolyte. With these restrictions the interaction between the electrode and
qizi
the electrolyte can quite generally be described by a contribution ∼ σ

5

P

where the summation includes both the mobile ionic and the molecular multi-
pole charges [?]. Such constraints clearly exclude ”polarizable” models, those
explicitly treating molecular electronic polarizability, electron density penetra-
tion into regions occupied by electrolyte, etc.

3.2.2 Relaxing gap capacitors (RGC)

Immobility of the charged ”plates” in primitive models does not account for
another important phenomenon, possible displacement of the ”electronic plate”
of interfacial capacitors and of the equilibrium positions of the electrolyte species
in contact with the electrode, in response to charging [?, ?, ?, ?]. These eﬀects
are eﬀectively illustrated by the ”relaxing gap capacitor” metaphor, which
emphasizes the dependence of the eﬀective gap d on charging. The potential
drop can be quite generally represented as

φ =

σd(σ)

1
εε0
where d(σ) is the eﬀective separation between the ”plates” of the capacitor
associated with the ”centers of mass” of two microscopic charge distributions
(see [?, ?, ?] for review). We assume a uniform dielectric background ε between
the plates, in the volume occupied by free charges. For models using a non-
uniform background, typical of uniﬁed models used to account for both the
”inner” (or Helmholtz) and the diﬀuse layers [?], the expression is more complex
and must also account for the distributions of the bound (polarization) charges.
However, these details are not essential; they are omitted here.

(9)

For the electrode-electrolyte interface the eﬀective separation is

d(σ) = zi(σ) − zi,e(σ)

(10)

where

zi,e =

with z the coordinate normal to the electrode surface. The inverse diﬀerential
capacitance for the RGC is

(

C)−1 = (σd(σ))′

σ = d(σ) + σd(σ)′
σ.

(11)

Dependence of d on σ, a general feature of practically all double layer models,
implies that C is dependent on σ (or on the applied voltage). The ”plate”
displacement that contributes to the variation of d not only reﬂects a shift of
charge density proﬁles, but is more a consequence of shape variation [?]. Quite
typically, there is always a σ range in which charging decreases the eﬀective
gap. Elastic compression of the lipid membrane by electric stress [?, ?, ?] and
response of the Gouy-Chapman-Stern (GCS) diﬀuse layer to charging [?] are
two representative examples.

6

In a range of σ where the eﬀective gap contracts with charging, d

(σ) < 0

′

and Cσ can be negative if

∆σ · d − σ · ∆d < 0.

(12)

This inequality means that a potential increase due to a change of σ is over-
whelmed by its decrease due to gap contraction. A number of electromechanical
and microscopic models [?, ?, ?, ?] show that negative capacitance (NC) under
σ-control is compatible with system stability. For instance, for every ﬁxed σ
(including the domain where C < 0) the equilibrium gap of the elastic capacitor
is deﬁned by a stable balance between elastic and electrostatic forces. Similarly,
density functional minimization led to a NC at metal-electrolyte interfaces due
to relaxation of the ”electronic plate” of the capacitor [?, ?, ?].

Previous work [?, ?] showed that accounting for ”electronic plate” relaxation
in combination with traditional GCS and similar models typically leads to neg-
ative C domains even though the GCS model itself (as with any other ”local”
statistical model where ionic concentrations are local functions of the potential)
does not lead to such anomalies [?], a point further demonstrated in the Ap-
pendix. Thus, while we agree that ﬁnding C < 0 under σ-control must be both
common and important for ionic models of electrolytes [?], it is not a necessary
condition for the appearance of this anomaly. If other relaxation mechanisms
are taken in account a NC domain may arise even if the ionic contribution is
positive.

3.2.3 Possible capacitance anomalies for local σ-controlled statistical

models with interfacial relaxation

Consider a conventional two-layer model of the double layer, with a Helmholtz
layer accounting for the ﬁnite ion-electrode distance of closest approach, a, and
the diﬀuse layer accounting for the electrolyte’s ionic charge distribution [?, ?].
Its inverse capacitance is

C−1(σ) = C−1

H (σ) + C−1

D (σ)

(13)

Here

H (σ) = ∂σφH
D (σ) = ∂σφD
with φH and φD the potential drops in the Helmholtz and diﬀuse layers respec-
tively. We now treat ”local statistical” diﬀuse layer models.

(14)

C−1
C−1

These simple models describe the ionic density ρi at a distance z from the

electrode as a function of the local potential ϕ(z):

The classic example is the Poisson-Boltzman-Gouy-Chapman (PBGC) model of
symmetric electrolytes

(15)

(16)

ρi = ρi[ϕ(z)]

ρi = qn0 cos h[−βqϕ(z)]

7

with n0 the bulk concentration of cations or anions. For the slightly more com-
plex model treating ”ionic saturation,” ﬁnite ion size driven entropic restriction
on local ionic concentration, which can be especially signiﬁcant in solid elec-
trolytes, the ionic density is

ρi(z) = qn0 [

exp[−βϕ]
1 − Θ1 + Θ1 exp[−βϕ]

−

exp[βϕ]
1 − Θ2 + Θ2 exp[−βϕ]

(17)

where Θ1,2 = n0/N1,2 and N1,2 are maximal possible concentrations for the
cations and anions respectively. Concentration limitations reﬂect ﬁnite ionic
size and, for solid electrolytes, the limitations on the number of possible ionic
defect sites in the crystal lattice.

The one-dimensional contact model is illustrated in Fig. 1.

We use a two-layer dielectric model of the interface

is the eﬀective gap of the Helmholtz layer. As a result, in direct analogy with
Eq. 11,

C−1

H (σ) =

εH ε0

[a − ze(σ) − σ ∂σ ze]

(21)

The signiﬁcance of Eq. 19 is that dH (σ) depends on σ via displacement
of the ”electronic plate” ze of the equivalent interfacial capacitor during the
charging process. This eﬀectively turns CH into a ”relaxing gap capacitor”
[?, ?, ?]. The σ-dependence of the position of the equivalent electronic plate
has been studied using a density functional approach for various models of
the ionic charge distribution near the electrode, from the Raleigh picture [?]
where the ionic charge density is localized in one or two monolayers nearest
the electrode, to the ”external ﬁeld” limit, where countercharges are located far
from the electrode [?, ?, ?] ). The diﬀuse layer distribution is generally bounded
by these limits; ze(σ) is always well approximated by the cubic polynomial

which shows that CD is always positive and ﬁnite for any ﬁnite σ. Thus local

statistical models don’t satisfy the criteria suggested by [?]. We now show that
charging induced relaxation of the ”electron plate” (see Eqs. 22 and 23) can
lead to a negative total capacitance even if the diﬀusive contribution is strictly
positive. In the spirit of σ-control we express φD and CD solely in terms of σ.
Corresponding relations were discussed for various local ionic models in [?, ?].

This picture clearly demonstrates how the relaxing gap capacitor is related
to the GC diﬀuse layer. In both models charging contracts the eﬀective gap.
However, the rate of contraction in the PBGC model is insuﬃcient for the
formation of a peak in φ(Σ) (curve 2), observed in the elastic capacitor (curve
4) and associated with the C < 0 domain. This follows directly from a general
property of all local models, that C is positive at all surface charge densities, σ.
By considering the solid electrolyte, AgCl, for which the compact layer elec-
tronic properties have been studied in [?, ?], we show that a compact layer can
lead to a negative total (diﬀuse + compact) layer capacitance. The temperature
dependence of the parameters ε and c0 are given by [?]. At 4000C, c0 ∼ 43 mM
and ε ∼ 3 so that LD ∼ 2.7 ˚A and σ0 ∼ 0.55 µC/cm2. Combining Eqs. 23 and

(31)

According to the commonly held view, the contribution of the compact layer
eﬀectively increases the eﬀective gap, thus increasing the total inverse capaci-
tance. However, the appearance of a domain where C < 0 implies that C−1can
be reduced suﬃciently to become negative. Therefore , one expects that if local
model diﬀuse layer contribution is strictly positive, this should be even more
pronounced in presence of the compact layer. The following d

The traditional model (line 1) includes the diﬀuse layer, Eq. 28, in series
with the ﬁxed compact layer contribution calculated in the ”perfect conductor”
model. This ignores diﬀuseness of the electronic distribution and its relaxation
in the compact layer, in eﬀect assuming

C−1

H =

Naturally this capacitance is positive at all σ. Accounting for electronic re-
laxation in the compact layer dramatically aﬀects behavior. The parameters
xe(o), s, p and r (Eqs 22 and 23) were calculated by [?, ?] for Au/AgX con-
tacts.

The corresponding C is shown for AgCl (line 2). Electronic relaxation leads
to a pronounced capacitance asymmetry and steep growth in the cathodic range
of charges, both eﬀects observed experimentally [?, ?]. It yields a vertical C
asymptote separating C > 0 (σ > σcr) and C < 0 (not shown) domains. This
result is general, and unaﬀected by variation of εH (typically from 2 to 5),
εv (from 3 to 10) or electronic parameters reﬂecting diﬀerent approximations
to the electronic density functional [?, ?, ?]. The appearance of a negative
capacitance domain is similar to phenomena arising from the compact layer
at metal-solvent interfaces [?] Thus, C < 0 may occur under σ−control even
for local diﬀuse layer models if the metal electrode modeled realistically. Put
diﬀerently, a C < 0 domain may arise even for local ionic models with strictly
positive diﬀuse layer contributions, if additional electronic (and possibly other)
mechanisms for interfacial relaxation are considered.

3.3 q-control in the isolated system

As discussed, σ-control is an artiﬁcial construct. Nevertheless, charges are nor-
mally distributed uniformly in the plane of the electrode and the charge q nat-
urally yields a uniform charge density σ, in which case σ- and q-control are
identical. However, it is possible that under special conditions a non-uniform
distribution of charge in the electrode plane becomes energetically preferable.
Under these conditions the σ-control metaphor implies that artiﬁcial restraints
(forces) were applied to the surface charges to enforce uniformity of σ. Elimina-
tion of these artiﬁcial restraints would result in transition to an inhomogeneous
state. We will show this and its relation to the sign of the capacitance by
considering an undulating membrane capacitor, an exactly solvable model that
contains many features common to real EDLs, which is thus generally useful for
discussing double layer behavior under critical conditions.

For a membrane capacitor under potential control the onset of instability
results from the steep increase of the electrostatic force ∼ φ2/h2 where φ is
the applied potential and h is the membrane thickness. This arises because
the system is open: as h decreases, thinning leads to charge transfer between a
battery and the plates of the capacitor required to maintain the ﬁxed value of the
potential drop φ ∼ σh = const. Mathematically, charge transfer is controlled by
the term −qφ relating the thermodynamic potentials of the open and isolated
capacitor (Eq. 4). Thus, both the charge density and the attractive force
increase unrestrainedly as the plates approach one another. At a critical voltage,
no increase of the elastic repulsive force can compensate for the catastrophic
increase of the electrostatic attraction, leading to the potential-driven instability
ﬁrst noted by Crowley [?].

11

In an isolated system this pathway to instability is forbidden. When isolated,
the total plate charge is ﬁxed and uniform system thinning cannot increase the
attractive force, which remains constant, ∼ σ2. Instability can only result from
nonuniform redistribution of the charge density in the plane of the membrane
capacitor with an associated inhomogeneity in h. Thus we are led to consider
the possible lateral instability of an isolated ﬂexible membrane capacitor. For
φ-control we solved this problem for electrolyte charge distributions that satisfy
the Poisson-Boltzmann equation [?]. Here we consider a simpliﬁed example, a
capacitor in contact with a ”perfect conductor,” i.e. εsolvent = ∞, so that the
membrane surfaces are isopotentials, a reliable approximation even for dilute
electrolytes [?].

Consider the parallel-plate membrane capacitor with its midplane at z = 0
and an unperturbed thickness (when q = 0) equal to h0. Charging the membrane
to charge density σ yields an electrostatic pressure which gives rise to membrane
compression. Introducing the thinning coeﬃcient α = h/h0, with h the thickness
of the compressed membrane, the total energy of the uniform slab is

W0 = Wd,0 + We,0 where Wd,0 =

the two terms are the harmonic approximation to the deformation (stretching-

ing modulus and the index ”0” refers to a uniformly deformed membrane. The
equilibrium membrane thickness h(σ) = h0α(σ) is found from the condition

the meaning of σcr. It is the charge density where the diﬀerential capacitance
Cσ becomes inﬁnite; Cσ is negative for |σ| > σcr. The corresponding membrane
thickness is

h(σcr) =

at σ = σcr the membrane has thinned by ∼ 33% , a value typical of ”relaxing
gap” capacitor models [?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?]. The membrane is stable relative to
virtual uniform compression (thinning) under σ-control (i.e. assuming a uniform
surface charge density) for all σ including the range where C < 0. This is
veriﬁed from Eq. 32:

We now focus on the energy change, ∆W , for an isolated membrane capacitor
in response to a small charge increment, ∆σ, assuming σ-control. Using the
relation

we ﬁnd:

σσW (σ) = C−1(σ)
∂2

∆W = φ(σ)∆σ +

C−1(σ) (∆σ)2.

This equation has important consequences. First virtually separate the mem-
brane capacitor into equal patches I and II, each of area A/2 and permit the
charge ∆q = A∆σ/2 to ﬂow from I to II. For simplicity neglect boundary ef-
fects and assume each charge density is uniform (σ1 = σ − ∆σ and σ2 = σ + ∆σ)
and that the patches deform independently, i.e. two membrane capacitors are
in parallel, and not elastically coupled. Since the potential is constant in the
plane of the membrane, we ﬁnd from Eq. 38 that the total energy change is

∆W12 =

∆W1 +

∆W2 =

C−1 (∆σ)2.

Thus ∆W12 is negative if C < 0 for the chosen σ. Put diﬀerently, C < 0 pro-
vides a driving force leading to a nonuniform charge distribution and membrane
deformation if the artiﬁcial σ-control restrictions are relaxed.

The energy penalty results from the continuous transition between the prop-
erties of the two membrane patches and can be described as a linear interfacial
tension. It is proportional to the length of the border between them and, for
large A, is negligible relative to ∆W12, Eq. 39. Thus this charge density re-
distribution and the corresponding non-uniform deformation of the membrane
is possible energetically for those charge densities that lead to a C < 0 domain
assuming σ-control. The appearance of C < 0 in treatments that presume a
uniform charge density indicates the system is unstable . This result is similar
to the thermodynamic arguments of Nikitas [?] who considered equilibrium
conditions between two separate surface phases. We will now show that the

13

prediction of negative capacitance under σ-control also implies that there is the
possibility of forming an inhomogeneous phase under q-control.. In our virtual
experiment we assumed the charge density is uniform in each patch. Releasing
this restriction provides other pathways for transition to a non-uniform state.
Consider, for example, membrane stability relative to symmetric undulations,
the harmonic variation of membrane thickness:

h(x) = h + 2 u cos(kx),

where u is the amplitude of the undulation of the membrane surfaces; the cor-
responding ”left” and ”right” interfaces are described by the equations

zr,l(x) = ± z0(x) where z0(x) = h/2 + u cos(kx).

This problem has been discussed previously for φ-controlled systems (see [?, ?, ?]
and references therein). We treat a q-control environment by ﬁxing the average
charge density q = σA instead of the membrane potential φ.

Some aspects of the solution procedure should be stressed.
(1) Unlike under φ-control, under q-control the transmembrane potential
drop V is not ﬁxed by the external source (battery, potentiostat). However, the
conductive surfaces are still equipotentials and the potential φq is constant on
the membrane plane.

(2) The value of φq depends on both the original charge density σ of the
unperturbed membrane and the parameters u and k, characterizing the undu-
lations.

(3) φq is then determined as follows:

(a) The solution for a ﬁxed but arbitrary φ determines the poten-
tial v(x, z) within the membrane [?] (see also discussion in [?] and references
therein).

(b) The equation 4πσ(x) = ε∇nv(x, z0(x)) determines the local charge

density σ(x), where ∇n is the normal derivative taken at the interface z0(x).

(c) The total interfacial charge

the interface with a weighting factor, 1/
membrane stretching associated with undulations.

q(V ), is found by integrating σ(x) over
1 − [∂xz0(x)]2, that accounts for the

with h = h(σ) = h0α(σ). The externally ﬁxed potential φ in the equations
for φ-control can now be replaced by φq, which completes the solution of the
problem for q-control.

is the undulatory contribution. The onset of instability is determined by com-
petition between the decrease of the electrostatic energy, Eq. 43, and the cor-
responding increase in membrane deformation energy averaged in XY-plane,
Wd,u. For simplicity, we consider small k (the long- wavelength limit) kh << 1.
Similar to [?] where a slightly diﬀerent form of Wd,0, Eq. 32, was used, we can
represent Wd,u as

Wd,u ∼

Higher order terms in (kh)2 arise from surface tension and bending contributions
to the elastic energy and are neglected. They are analogs to the non-uniform
interfacial contributions of the previous example. In the same limit Eq. 43 can
be represented as

The uniform distribution becomes unstable when

Wu = Wd,u + W q

e,u ≤ 0.

Substituting Eqs. 43 and 33 we ﬁnd the condition of instability:

which is equivalent to

| σ| ≥ σ

cr,

C−1

q ≤ 0.

Our thought experiment presumed that the conditions for σ-control , i.e. unifor-
mity of σ, could be arbitrarily relaxed anywhere within the negative C domain.
In reality there is no way to enforce uniformity when the system is unstable;
thus the distribution spontaneously becomes inhomogeneous at the edge of this
domain with critical point σ = σcr, where

C−1
q

(σcr) = 0;

(46)

the transition actually occurs a bit earlier, at a point roughly determined by a
Maxwell construction [?].

We have analyzed a simpliﬁed model corresponding to a concentrated elec-
trolyte (Debye length λD → 0). Further analysis based on our previous work
shows that Eq. 46 also determines the onset of instability for ﬁnite λD [?]. This
result is valuable on its own. As already indicated the Poisson-Boltzmann ap-
proximation and other local statistical models do not predict NC (see [?, ?] and
references therein). Eqs. 11 and 12 show that for these models the rate of gap
contraction with charging, d′(σ), is always less than 1/|σ| and thus Cσ is always
positive. Consequently, this class of models would not satisfy the criteria sug-
gested in [?] linking model quality to the appearance of a Cσ < 0 domain. Our
results indicate that adding another relaxation mechanism immediately leads
to the appearance of a Cσ < 0 domain and instability. This and our earlier
discussion of the electronic models illustrates that anomalies are more typical
than expected based on purely ionic models with immobile charged plates.

In previous analysis [?] we considered two elastically coupled membrane
capacitors, with the extra term in the deformational energy ∼ α (u1 − u2)2
accounting for the non-uniformity penalty (diﬀerential thinning of the patches).
Depending on the coupling constant α, this system could exhibit a C < 0
domain before transition to a nonuniform state. Our present discussion implies
such a picture is unrealistic. In terms of the ﬁrst model, the constant α must
be proportional to the width of the transition region relative to the area of
the patches A and thus can become inﬁnitesimal if A is suﬃciently large. In
addition, as shown in the second example, the non-uniformity contributions
become insigniﬁcant at small k which provides a reasonable pathway for the
onset of instability.

Finally, we reiterate the major diﬀerence between q- and φ-control for the on-
set of instability. Under φ-control (an open system connected to a potentiostat)
stability is lost simultaneously for both uniform deformation and undulations
[?, ?]. In contrast, a q-controlled (isolated) system is always stable with respect
to uniform deformation (see Eq. 37 and the corresponding discussion) and only
loses stability in transiting to a nonuniform state. An important consequence is
that in a φ-driven transition the original and ﬁnal phases correspond to diﬀer-
ent values of q while under q-control only the local charge density can change
provided its average value is ﬁxed.

4 Perspectives for further study

It is by now well established that the capacitance can be negative for uniformly
charged surfaces under the artiﬁcial conditions of σ-control. Many statisti-
cal ionic models have demonstrated this anomaly (see [?, ?, ?] and references
therein). While in the 1980s many would have viewed such predictions as model
faults, the most recent view [?, ?] represents a dramatic change of mind, and it
is even suggested that the prediction of C < 0 must be considered as a criterion
validating an ionic model [?] rather than an imperfection. We do not disagree.
In fact, it accords with our observation [?, ?, ?, ?] that such predictions are
typical of models jointly accounting for various contributions (electronic, ionic,

16

etc.) to the charging induced relaxation of the eﬀective gap of the interfacial
capacitor.

What is the physical signiﬁcance of such predictions? Our analysis indicates
that they imply an instability with respect to a transition to an inhomogeneous
state. To analyze the consequences, the artiﬁcial assumption of a uniform sur-
face charge distribution must be dropped, given that in a real metallic electrodes
the electrons are free to move and thus surface charge density can become, at
least in principle, laterally non-uniform. This non-uniformity can be even more
pronounced in soft media such as lipid bilayers. The value of the models pre-
dicting this anomaly, emphasized in [?], is even greater since they are candidates
for analyzing such instability.

We must re-emphasize that in our usage the terms ”instability” and ”tran-
sition” are not related to real interfacial critical phenomena. While the phase
transition actually occurs before Cσ becomes negative, we permit the system
to enter this domain by artiﬁcially maintaining σ-control. Relaxing the uni-
formity constraint at any σ within the C < 0 domain leads immediately to
a transition to an inhomogeneous state of ﬁxed q, q = σA. Although the ini-
tial (σ-controlled) state is artiﬁcial, the ﬁnal stable inhomogeneous phase (if
it exists) is real since the equilibrium state is unique. Thus, our approach is
useful for testing and developing statistical models that describe both uniform
(C > 0) and inhomogeneous (regions with C < 0 under σ-control) phases.

Predicting instability does not necessarily imply that the model describes
the formation of a new stable inhomogeneous phase. As the transition can
be accompanied by a substantial local increase of the charge density and a
corresponding local increase of the ionic density in the EDL, a model must
have a stabilization mechanism that interrupts the propagation of instability.
This would permit formation of new stable phase before the condition of ”ideal
polarizability” is broken and interfacial charge transfer occurs. Ionic size and
correlation eﬀects in the electrolyte must be important here.

Although the condition C < 0, obtained for a primitive ionic model of the
EDL, can be an important factor leading to instability, it is not a necessary
condition. Even with ionic models that by themselves do not lead to instability
(such as GCS model) the addition of other mechanisms of relaxation, such as
a displacement of the ”electronic plate” of the interfacial capacitor, can lead to
Cσ < 0 and thus trigger the instability [?, ?]. In other words, this anomaly
should be even more commonplace than is implied by ionic model studies.

Another important question is a comparison of phase transitions predicted
for the open and the isolated systems. While in the ﬁrst case the transition can
be accompanied by charging the electrodes, in the second case the lateral varia-
tion of charge keeps the total charge ﬁxed. Finally, the inherent inhomogeneity
(roughness) of an electrode surface (especially with respect to solid electrodes)
must be considered. The inﬂuence of the roughness on the equilibrium proper-
ties of EDL is well established [?], and its possible eﬀect on the surface phase
transition can also be a promising ﬁeld for further research.

General introduction

This thesis describes the scattering dynamics of methane from tran-
sition metals. The dynamics is studied by wave packet (quantum
dynamics) and classical (Newtonian) trajectory simulations. Al-
though the dissociation of methane is not studied itself, I try to
deduce consequences for the dissociation from the scattering sim-
ulations. I give a general introduction in this chapter with a de-
scription of theoretical research in general, and explain the chemi-
cal theories which are used nowadays. Next I discuss catalysis and
how my research is related to this. I end with an overview of the
next chapters.

1.1 Theory in action

This dissertation describes theoretical chemical research on the scattering of
methane from transition metal surfaces. I try to deduce from the scattering
consequences for the dissociation of methane, which is important for catalysis.
I will explain in this introduction: What is theoretical research supposed to
do? What kind of chemical theories are in use? What can be the relevance of
my research for catalysis? And ﬁnally: What can be found in the rest of this
book?

The core business of theoretical research is a mixture of speculation, cal-
culation, model building, and approximation.∗ There are diﬀerent levels of
speculation, which you normally can ﬁnd back if words like hypotheses and
assumption are used. Simple speculation can be for example that there are

I follow here Chapter 12 of Ref. [?], which you can read for a more extended discussion

on theoretical research.

CHAPTER 1. GENERAL INTRODUCTION

particles, and these particles have interactions with each other. More complex
speculation occurs if the interaction is expressed by a mathematical equation,
which is called then a theory. The theory has some parameters, which can be
later on ﬁlled in for a speciﬁc experiment. The parameters can be ﬁtted on
the experiment, obtained from other theories, or just guessed for a lucky shot.
At that moment we are already busy with calculations. If the parameters are
ﬁlled in or the mathematical equations are combined, we apply the general
theory into a speciﬁc model. Sometimes the model is too complex for drawing
simple conclusions from it, or it is very hard or even impossible to solve all the
equations (calculation) within a reasonable amount of time. Approximation
is then a way to overcome such a problem. Approximation contains also a
bit of speculation itself. We assume that the subset of the model will be able
to describe the experiment (at less in part) the same as the original model.
The subset of the original is an model itself on which the same tricks can be
applied later on.

Most experimentalists do use theory for the interpretations of their exper-
iments. For some problems the developed theory or the system under study
will become so complex or the model so big, that calculation can only be per-
formed if one only focus on theory. My research is an example of this. A lot
of approximation have been done to obtain models, which are small enough
to be calculated on a computer. I need to know something about computer
programming and numerical methods, before I can put them into a computer.
I also have to compare the results of my calculated approximated models with
the available experiments. I have to look for agreement, and speculate how
we can overcome the disagreements between the models and experiments. Of
course my models are not build totally from scratch, but are developed from
established chemical theories.

1.2 Chemical theory

Chemistry studies things we normally denote with substance, matter, material,
and chemicals. It is not only interested in the matter itself, but also how it can
be changed in something else. We all know a lot of this matter, because we use
at lot of it on a daily basis. We cook, eat, do the dishes, wash our clothes, clue
our ﬁngers, and making ﬁre for heating. Still there are some things we let over
to specialists. The chemists are specialists in (change of) matter. Chemist
make use of theoretical concepts for the description of chemical phenomena. I
will give an small and global overview of the three most important theoretical
concepts; Thermodynamics, kinetics, and molecular dynamics.

1.2. CHEMICAL THEORY

1.2.1 Thermodynamics and kinetics

Thermodynamics is a very well established chemical theory. It is a spin oﬀ
from the developments on the steam engine at the end of the 18th century, to
which its name still refer. Thermodynamics stands for how heat is transfered
into work [?]. The theory itself is not about dynamics at all, but deals with
thermostatic phenomena. Thermodynamics describes equilibrium conditions.
In thermodynamics everything is related to diﬀerent kinds of energy. A
chemical reaction is thermodynamical possible (runs on its own), if the energy
of the products is lower then the energy of the reactants. Such an reaction is
then called exothermic, because the loss of energy from the reactants to the
products is given back as heat. If the products have a higher energy than the
reactants, then the chemical reaction is called endothermic. An endothermic
reaction cannot run independently, but it needs a side reaction that delivers
the heat necessary for the reaction.

If a reaction is thermodynamical possible (exothermic), then a reaction
does not have to occur at all. Thermodynamics does not say anything about
the time-scale of a reaction. The time-scale is left over to chemical kinetics,
which studies the rate of the reaction as a function of concentration, pressure,
and temperature. The reaction rate r can be linear dependent of the concen-
tration c (or pressure) of the reactants in a simple case. This can be written
as

where k is the rate constant. The rate constant can be expressed by the
Arrhenius rate law

r = k c,

k = A e−Ea/RT ,

(1.1)

(1.2)

where A is the prefactor, Ea is the activation energy, R is the gas constant, and
T the temperature. The activation energy can be seen as a barrier which needs
to be overcome to let the reaction occur. This barrier is sketched in Figure 1.1
for an exothermic reaction. We can see now that we ﬁrst need energy to
overcome the barrier before the reaction can occur, although the energy of
the products is lower then the energy of the reactants. Thermal energy can
be used to overcome the barrier. Raising the temperature increases the rate
of the reaction, while a higher activation energy decreases it. The backward
reaction from product to reactant is also possible, but the activation energy
EP ) is higher than for the forward reaction
for the backward reaction (EB −
ER). The consequence of this is that the rate constant of the forward
(EB −
reaction is larger than the rate constant of the backward reaction, which means
that the concentration of the product is higher than of the reactants at the

time the thermodynamics equilibrium is reached.

A conversion from reactants to products does not always occur in one step,
but can consist out of multiple steps.
In such a case we have to overcome
multiple barriers. The reactants are then converted into an intermediate, and
the intermediate into other intermediates or ﬁnally into the products. The
reaction step with the highest barrier is the rate limiting step, because it is
the bottle neck for the overall reaction rate.

1.2.2 Molecular dynamics

Nowadays the world is full of molecules. However, this was not always the
case. Of course there was an atomic world-view suggested by Democritus,
and the corpuscles of Boyle went in the direction of molecules, but they were
not very useful at their time. Thermodynamics and kinetics works very well
without any notion of molecules. The real victory of the atoms and molecules
is established at the beginning of the twentieth century. Beside that (chemist
assume that) there are small particles like molecule, we also take for granted
that they move and do interact with each other. The kinetic energy of the
random motion of particles is now associated with the temperature.

e, and nuclei
called an atom. Electrons have always an electron charge of
can have charges of +e to more than +100e. The mass of an electron is much
lower than the mass of a nucleus. The mass of the nucleus increases with the
charge of the nucleus, but there can exist nuclei with diﬀerent masses while
their charge is the same. These nuclei are called isotopes.

−

Negative and positive charged particle have an attractive interaction with
each other. Two negative or positive charged particles have a repulsive inter-
action. If the nuclei are in a certain position from each other with in between
them some electrons, and the total attraction is larger than the total repul-
sion, then the result is a stable molecule. The spatial arrangement of a stable
molecule, which is normally called the molecular structure, is responsible for
the physical and chemical properties of a substance. The structure of a stable
molecule has a lower energy than other spatial arrangements near that struc-
ture. We are talking about isomers, if two molecule have the same number of
electrons and types of nuclei, but the nuclei are arranged diﬀerent in space.

Within the molecular world-view a chemical reaction is a spatial rearrange-
ment of nuclei and electrons over a period of time, which gives molecules with
a diﬀerent structure (the products) than the original molecules (the reactants).
This rearrangement is possible, because the nuclei have kinetic energy that can
be used to overcome a barrier of potential energy between diﬀerent molecular
structures. We do not only have to know the height of the barrier, but we are
also interested how we can use the kinetic energy to overcome this. We do
so by studying the dynamics of nuclei during the reaction. We do not have
to look at the rearrangement of the electrons, because they rearrange much
faster than nuclei. Three things are important for the reaction dynamics; The
initial momentums and positions of the nuclei, and the potential energy for
each spatial arrangement of the nuclei. If we know these, then we can calculate
for every time the positions of the nuclei with a dynamical theory.

There are at least three dynamical theories, which are all useful for a spe-
ciﬁc set of natural phenomena. Classical dynamics is very useful for describing
the fall of an apple out of a tree. Quantum dynamics needs to be used for
very small particles like electrons. For spaceships traveling near the speed of
light we apply relativistic dynamics. Molecules have properties such as trans-
lational and rotational motion, which can be described sometimes as accurate
with classical and as with quantum dynamics. Quantum dynamics is better
in treating vibrational motion, but it has the draw back that is harder to
calculate with. In this thesis I use both classical and quantum dynamics for

simulating the scattering of methane on transition metal surfaces. (We use
normally the term wave packet dynamics for quantum dynamics applied on
molecular motion.)

1.3 Catalysis

A catalyst is a chemical, which can change the rate of a reaction step without
ending up in a reaction product. This means that it changes the kinetics of a
reaction and not the thermodynamics. A catalyst can be used for changing the
reactivity or the selectivity of a reaction. Reactivity means that the reaction
rate of a reaction is enhanced, and by so that the reactants are converged faster
into the products. However, there is not always only one reaction possible if we
start with a set of reactants. This can result in a bunch of products. We have
not always equal interest in all products. If we are not interested in a product
at all, then we call it even waste. We can try to avoid this undesired product
by increasing the reaction rate of the reactions to the desired products more
than the reaction rate of the reactions to the waste or less desired products.
In this case we make use of the selectivity of a catalysts.

Catalysis is the name of the science that studies catalysts. Catalysis has
many technological aspects, because the output of the research has to beneﬁt
us. The main goal is to let make catalysts better. The main question is: What
is the optimal catalyst for a given reaction? Chemistry is not the only science
that plays a role in answering this question. Of course we can search for an
optimum between reactivity and selectivity. The found optimum catalyst is
not always the most economic favourable catalysts. The optimum catalyst
in terms of reactivity and selectivity is unfortunately most of the time also
the most expensive, so a cheaper but less selective or reactive catalyst can
give more proﬁt. Another chemical and economical problem is the stability of
the catalyst. After a certain time a catalyst is not anymore as reactive and
selective as at the time it was placed in the reactor. This can be caused by
thermal instability or poisoning of the catalyst. The consequence of this is
that the original catalyst has to be replaced in the reactor by a new one. This
can be very costly, because one has to buy a new catalyst and the reactor
cannot be used during the replacement of the catalyst.

Catalysts can be divided into two classes: Homogeneous and heterogeneous
catalysts. Homogeneous catalysts are in the same phase as the reactants, and
has the advantage that they are well-dispersed and well-mixed with the reac-
tants. They are also in general more complex, and by so more selective than
heterogeneous catalysts. Examples of homogeneous catalyst are the enzymes

1.4. OVERVIEW OF THIS THESIS

in living creatures, and organo-metallic complexes used for polymerisation re-
actions. A disadvantage of homogeneous catalyst is that the products are hard
to separate from the catalyst.

Heterogeneous catalysts are in a diﬀerent phase than the reactants and
products. Normally this means that the catalyst is solid and the reactants are
gaseous or liquid. The reaction takes place at the interphase between the cat-
alyst and reactant phase. Heterogenous catalysts are widely used in industry
for the conversion of bulk chemicals. Examples of industrial heterogeneous
catalysts are zeolites and transition metal clusters deposited on micro-porous
carrier materials.

The last example is important for steam (H2O) reforming of methane
(CH4) for the production of syngas (CO + H2). Syngas can be used as build-
ing blocks for the productions of various organic molecules. The rate limiting
step in the steam reforming of methane is the breaking of an C–H bond [?]. It
is very diﬃcult to study this reaction step on its own in an industrial catalyst.
Therefore we have to look for model systems which make it possible to do so.
Surface science has given us such a model. The metal clusters are modeled
by a metal surface with a well-deﬁned topology. The metal surface can be
placed in a box and deposited on a gas mixture. If the box is under ultra high
vacuum (UHV), then it is also possible to study reactions at the interphase
with spectroscopic techniques. One can also shoot molecules with a speciﬁc
velocity at the surface with a gun called molecular beam. Over the last decades
a lot of new phenomena have been created with these molecular beams, which
have never been seen before. I did not work with molecular beams, but I have
tried to make some dynamical models for describing the observations with
molecular beams of methane on metal surfaces. So at the end my research
might contribute a very little bit to a better understanding of the working
of a heterogeneous industrial catalyst.
If you like to see any relevance of
my research with daily live issues, then you can ﬁnd it through this small
connection. I leave the judgement to you.

1.4 Overview of this thesis

This thesis describes simulations of methane scattering on a nickel metal sur-
face. Although the dissociation of methane is not studied, I try to deduce
from the scattering simulations implication for the dissociation and to relate
them with the available molecular beam studies. Therefore, I will give an
overview of the experimental and theoretical studies on methane dissociation
on transition-metal surfaces in Chapter 2 ﬁrst.

CHAPTER 1. GENERAL INTRODUCTION

Chapter 3 gives an introduction and the computational details of our wave
packet simulations discussed in Chapters 4, 5, and 6. It describes four model
potential energy surfaces (PESs) for the scattering of oriented of CH4 and
CD4 from a ﬂat surface on which we performed our wave packet simulations. I
also gives a short survey of the multi-conﬁgurational time-dependent Hartree
(MCTDH) method, which we have used for our wave packet propagation,
because it can deal with a large number of degrees of freedom and with large
grids [?].

The scattering of CH4 in the vibrational groundstate on the model PESs
is presented in Chapter 4. At a translational energy up to 96 kJ/mol we ﬁnd
that the scattering of almost completely elastic. Therefore, we used vibrational
excitations when the molecule hits the surface and the corresponding deforma-
tion for the analysis of the scattering. From these we deduce consequences for
the dissociation mechanism, and ﬁnd that for methane to dissociate the inter-
action of the molecule with the surface should lead to an elongated equilibrium
C–H bond length close to the surface.

The isotope eﬀect is described in Chapter 5 by comparing the scattering of
CD4 with CH4. First, we look again at the scattering, excitation probabilities
when the molecule hits the surface, and the corresponding deformations. The
scattering is still predominantly elastic, but less so for CD4. Second, we do
an energy distribution analysis of the kinetic energy per mode and the PES
terms when the molecule hits the surface. They indicate that the orientation
with three bonds pointing towards the surface is mostly responsible for the
isotope eﬀect in methane dissociation.

Chapter 6 presents the role of vibrational excitation of a single mode in the
scattering of CH4 and CD4. Energy distribution analysis shows that initial
vibrational excitations enhance the transfer of translational energy towards
vibrational energy and increase the accessibility of the entrance channel for
dissociation. The simulations predict that initial vibrational excitations of the
asymmetrical stretch (ν3) and especially the symmetrical stretch (ν1) modes
will give the highest enhancement of the dissociation probability of methane.

In Chapter 7 I study the full rotational vibrational scattering of a non-
rigid CH4 molecule on a Ni(111) surface with classical (Newtonian) trajectory
calculations. Energy dissipation and scattering angles have been studied as
a function of the translational kinetic energy, the incidence angle, the (rota-
tional) nozzle temperature, and the surface temperature. Scattering angles are
somewhat below the incidence angles of 30◦, 45◦, and 60◦ at a translational
energy of 96 kJ/mol. Energy loss is primarily from the normal component of
the translational energy and transfered for somewhat more than half to the

I will end this thesis with some concluding remarks, and suggestion for

further research in Chapter 8.

The dissociation of methane

I will give in this chapter an overview of the experimental and the-
oretical studies on methane dissociation on transition-metal sur-
faces. The dissociation of methane on transition metals occurs
in general through a direct dissociation mechanism. Vibrational
energy is overall about as eﬃcient in enhancing dissociation as
translational energy, which suggests a late reaction barrier.

2.1 General theory of surface catalytic dissociation

I will now give an overview of the experimental and theoretical literature of
methane dissociation on surfaces. Before we enter into details, I will discuss
the catalytic activity of metal surfaces in general qualitative terms. Let us
assume therefore a diatomic molecule A–B, which we want to dissociate by an
catalytic metal surface. The overall reaction will be:

A–B (gas)

A (ads.) + B (ads.)

(2.1)

→

In this reaction equation we only see the initial reactant (molecule A–B) and
the ﬁnal products (A and B atoms adsorbed on the metal surface). We are
interested in the mechanism of this catalytic reaction: What is the nature of
the interaction of the reactant with the surface during the reaction? Of course
there are a lot of mechanisms imaginable, but they can all be classiﬁed in two
types of mechanism. One of these mechanisms is the so called direct activated
process, where the molecule will dissociate directly at the moment that the
molecule approaches the surface. The A–B bond will be activated by energy

The other mechanism is an indirect process, which is also called a trapping
mediated process. The molecule has to adsorb at the surface ﬁrst, before it
can dissociate. The indirect reaction can be written as:

The diﬀerences between both mechanisms can be explained theoretically on
the basis of the interaction potentials of the surface with the molecule and its
dissociation products. Figure 2.1 a) shows the potential energy of the molecule
AB and its dissociation products A and B as a function of the distant to the
surface. The molecule AB has far away from the surface a much lower energy
than the dissociation product A and B. It is therefore hard to dissociate for
the molecule AB in the gas phase. If the molecule comes close to the surface,
then its energy will go up. The energy of the dissociation product A and B
drops towards the surface. The dissociate product A and B are even lower
in energy at the point were the line of AB crosses the line of A + B.∗ The
energy diﬀerence between the gas phase energy of the molecule and the energy
of the crossing point is smaller than the diﬀerence between the molecule and
dissociation products in the gas phase. The surface is now a catalyst, because
it makes the dissociation easier. The molecule needs translational energy to
run up against the surface repulsion and reach the crossing point. This is the
picture of a direct dissociation mechanism, because the dissociation occurs
directly at the collision with the surface.

Figure 2.1 b) shows again the potential energy of the molecule AB and its
dissociation products A and B as a function of the distant to the surface. The
energy diﬀerence in the gas phase is still large, so dissociation is hard. The
main diﬀerence with Figure 2.1 a) is that the interaction of the molecule AB
with the surface is changed. There is a well in the potential near the surface.
Because of this it is possible for the molecule AB to adsorb at the surface.
Translational energy is not needed to do so. The molecule can now reach the
crossing point with use of the available kinetic energy at the surface, when it
is adsorbed at the surface. The dissociation occurs then through a indirect
trapping mediated process. It is still possible to see a direct dissociation mech-
anism within the potential energy scheme of Figure 2.1 b), if the translational

dimensional schematic plots of Figure 2.1, because it also dependent of other coordinates
like the bond length.

2.2. EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES

13

energy of the molecule AB is high and it will be able to reach the crossing
point without absorbing ﬁrst.

It is now clear how we can experimentally distinguish a direct and indirect
dissociation mechanism. The dissociation probability of a direct mechanism
is primary dependent on the translational energy of the molecules in the gas
phase, and by so on the gas temperature. An indirect mechanism is on the
other hand primary dependent on the surface temperature.

Another point of interest is the role of the internal vibrations. Sometimes
the dissociation probability is enhanced by both vibrational and translational
energy. We need a potential, which is dependent of two dimensions to explain
how this is possible. Figure 2.2 shows two possible contour plots of potentials
which are dependent of the distance between the molecule and the surface,
and the bond length within the molecule. The diﬀerence between the two
plots is the location of the reaction barrier. Figure 2.2 a) shows a potential
with a so called early barrier. The reaction barrier can be accessed by mov-
ing the molecule towards the surface. For a potential with a late barrier as
sketched in Figure 2.2 b) a movement of the molecule towards the surface is
not enough. The bond need also be lengthened to before the reaction bar-
rier can be reached. For a potential with an early barrier only translational
energy is needed to overcome the barrier. For a potential with a late barrier
also vibrational energy is needed. Vibrational energy can be available initial
by vibrational excitations, or generated during the reaction by transferring
translational energy to vibrational energy.

The real interaction potential is even more complex than I sketched here.
It is also dependent of the translational coordinates parallel to the surface and
the orientation of the molecule. For a polyatomic molecule such as methane
it becomes even more complicates, because the potential is then dependent of
multiple vibrational modes.

2.2 Experimental studies

The dissociation mechanism on transition metal have been studied by either
bulb gas or molecular beam experiments. A bulb gas experiment is performed
by placing a metal surface in reactor and exposing it to a methane gas (mix-
ture) with a certain pressure and temperature. The surface is placed in a ultra
high vacuum chamber at molecular beam studies. The velocity and rovibra-
tional temperature of the molecules in the beam can be varied by changing
the gas mixture and temperature of the nozzle. Table 2.1 shows that one can
get more direct detailed information from molecular beam than from bulb gas

experiments. It is possible with the use of lasers to study the role of rotational
en vibrational excitation in more detail, which can be later on compared with
the outcome of molecular dynamics simulations. I will give here a now small
survey of all experimental studies. A more extended review can be read in
Ref. [?].

2.2.1 Bulb gas

One of the ﬁrst surface science studies of the methane dissociation was under
bulb gas condition on a tungsten surface [?]. A large kinetic isotope eﬀect
was observed for CH4 in comparison with CD4. In a second article also the
dissociative chemisorption of CH3D, CH2D2, and CHD3 were reported [?].
The apparent activation energies were discussed in terms of tunneling of hy-
drogen through a potential barrier, vibrational excitation, and the lifetime of
undissociated methane on the surface. Around the same time, it was reported
that the dissociation on rhodium surfaces can be enhanced by raising only
gas temperature of methane [?]. A large kinetic isotope eﬀect was observed
again, and this was attributed to the dominant role of vibrational activation.
Nevertheless two independent bulb gas experiment with laser excitation of the
ν3 asymmetrical stretch and 2ν4 umbrella modes on the Rh(111) surface, [?]
and laser excitation of the ν3 and 2ν3 modes on thin ﬁlms of rhodium [?] have
not revealed any noticeable enhancement in the reactivity of CH4.

Many years later, new thermal activation studies on rhodium by raising
independently the gas temperature and the surface temperature observed that
the dissociation increases in all cases with the surface temperature [?, ?]. It
was suggested therefore that both a direct and an (indirect) trapping medi-
ated mechanism plays a role. The diﬀerences in activation energies between
CH4 and CD4 were again explained in terms of internal vibrational excita-
tions. A measurement of the kinetic isotope eﬀect on W(211) [?] initiated a
debate, whether this experiment could be [?,?] or could not be [?,?] described

2.2. EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES

17

by a tunneling mechanism. An article about thermal activation experiment
under isothermal conditions reported a kinetic isotope eﬀect of a factor 20
on Ni(100), whereas none was observed on Ni(110) [?]. However, Ref. [?, ?]
found under the same conditions an activation energy twice as high for CH4 on
Ni(100) as Ref [?]. A direct reaction mechanism has been found on Ni(111) [?]
and Pt(110) [?], which contrasts reported trapping mediated mechanism on
Ni(100) [?]. On Ir(111) both mechanisms have been reported for 13CH4 and
CD4 [?].

2.2.2 Molecular beam

A large number of molecular beam experiments in which the dissociation en-
ergy was measured as a function of translational energy have already been
done on many diﬀerent surfaces. The ﬁrst experiments were performed on
W(110) and show that the sticking probability increases exponentially with
the normal component of the incident translational energy [?, ?]. This is in
agreement with a direct dissociation mechanism, and is observed by all later
molecular beam experiments (at the higher incident translational energies).
It was also observed that vibrationally hot CH4 dissociates more readily than
cold CH4, with the energy in the internal vibrations being about as eﬀective
as the translational energy in inducing dissociation, which have been con-
ﬁrmed by studies on other surfaces: Ni(111) [?, ?], Ni(100) [?, ?], Pt(111) [?],
Pt(110) [?, ?], and Ru(0001) [?]. There has been also measured a substan-
tial kinetic isotope eﬀect for CD4 compared with CH4 on W(110), which have
been reported also on Ir(110) [?, ?, ?], Ni(100) [?], and Pt(111) [?]. This in-
dicates again that the internal vibrational do play an important role in the
dissociation mechanism. A more detailed assessment of the importance of the
internal vibrations could not be made, because of the large number of internal
vibrations. However, two models about the role of the internal coordinates
have been suggested in relation with the experiments on Ni(111). By making
use of EELS vibrational spectroscopy it is demonstrated that the initial step
in the dissociation is the breaking of a single CH bond and the formation of
adsorbed CH3 and H fragments [?, ?, ?]. One of the suggestions is the direct
activation of the C–H bond, and another the so-called splats model [?]. The
splats model suggests that the critical requirement for methane dissociation is
angular deformation of methane which allows a Ni–C bond to form before a
C–H bond breaks. In the splats model the increased transfer of translational
kinetic energy to the bending and umbrella vibrational energy is responsible
for the strong dependency on normal incident translational energy. This has
been tested by inert gas atoms induced chemisorption [?, ?, ?]. Later studies

18

CHAPTER 2. THE DISSOCIATION OF METHANE

on Ni(100) have related the enhancement of dissociation probability by nozzle
temperature to the excitation of a general vibrational stretch mode [?].

A molecular beam experiment with laser excitation of the ν3 mode suc-
ceeded in measuring a dramatical enhancement of the dissociation on a
Ni(100), which was still, however, much too low to account for the vibra-
tional activation observed in previous studies. This indicates that other vi-
brationally excited modes contribute signiﬁcantly to the reactivity of thermal
samples [?, ?]. It has been shown also that the laser excitation of the ν3 mode
can be used to deposit carbon on a sub-micrometer scale [?]. Later on, the
eﬀect of rotational excitation in combination with the ν3 vibrational mode was
studied, which indicated that rotational excitation does not alter reactivity by
more than a factor two [?]. Very recently the eﬀect of a 2ν3 excitation on
the methane dissociation probability on Pt(111) has been measured [?]. They
ﬁnd that 72 kJ/mol of vibrational energy in the excited CH4 is approximately
equivalent to at least 30 kJ/mol normal translational energy.

Although one does not expect strong surface temperature eﬀects on the
sticking probability for a direct dissociation mechanism, it has been reported
anyway for some metal surfaces.
It has been noticed for the ﬁrst time by
Ref. [?] on Pt(111), but it was not observed by Ref. [?]. Later on surface
temperature eﬀects were observed on Ir(110) [?, ?], Ir(111) [?], and Pt(110)
[?, ?] at the lower incident translational energies.

There are further more some other molecular beam experiments, which
studies the eﬀect of adsorbate coverage on the dissociation probability; oxygen
on Pt(111) [?], Pd(110) [?], and Pt(110) [?]; and the eﬀect of surface alloying
coverage; Au on Ni(111) [?], Co on Cu(111) [?, ?], and K on Ni(100) and
Ni(111) [?]. The dissociation probability of methane was also compared with
higher alkanes [?, ?, ?, ?, ?].

Summarizing, we can say that the current opinion about methane dissoci-
ation on transition metals based on the beam molecular studies is as follow:
The dissociation is dominated by a direct dissociation mechanism, because it is
strongly dependent on translational energy. A trapping mediated mechanism
can also play a role on some metals at low translational energies, because
the dissociation probability is sometimes enhanced by the surface tempera-
ture. Vibrational excitation also enhances strongly the dissociation probabil-
ity, which suggest a late barrier for dissociation. State resolved information has
only been reported for the ν3 asymmetrical stretch mode. This mode enhances
the dissociation probability, but another mode is possibly more reactive.

The scattering of methane has also been studied with molecular beams on
Ag(111) [?, ?], Pt(111) [?, ?, ?, ?], and Cu(111) [?] surfaces. It was reported

2.3. THEORETICAL STUDIES

19

in Refs. [?, ?] that the scattering angles are in some cases anomalous with the
outcome of the classical Hard cube model (HCM) described in Ref. [?]. We
will show in Chapter 7 that the assumption of the HCM model are too crude
for describing the processes obtained from our simulation. The time of ﬂight
experiments show that there is almost no vibrational excitation during the
scattering [?, ?].

2.3 Theoretical studies

There are multiple ways to study a chemical reaction. One can simulate a
model of the dynamics, or use transition state theory. For both methods it is
necessary to obtain an idea of the interaction between particles in the system.
Information of an interaction is theoretically expressed as the potential. The
potential can be calculated empirical from ﬁtting experimental data (dissoci-
ation energies, spectra, etc.) or from electronic structure calculation. If we
want information about the thermodynamic properties of the system, then we
only have to calculate the potential energies of the reactant and the products.
Reaction rates can be obtain with transition state theory. This means
that we calculate the minimum energy path between reactants and products,
which will give us the energy of the transition state. Transition state theory
gives us only thermally average dissociation probabilities, which is useful if
we have to deal with trapping mediated dissociation mechanism. The main
assumption of transition state theory is that the available thermal energy will
be distributed equally over all modes. This is not the case for molecular
beam studies on a direct dissociation of methane on transition metal surfaces.
The energy can be distributed unequally over translational, rotational, and
vibrational modes. So it is not in thermal equilibrium. The best way to study
theoretically in detail the contribution of kinetic energy available in speciﬁc
modes to the reaction probability from the molecular beam experiments, is
with molecular dynamics simulations. For an accurate molecular dynamics
simulation we do not only need to know the minimum energy path, but also
the potential energy of other possible paths (in other directions). The reaction
path does not necessary have to be the minimum energy path, but can occur
also over a higher barrier which is better accessible with the available kinetic
energy. Non reactive paths are only important for calculating the reaction
probability. This means that we need to calculate for more points the potential
energy. We can construct with these points a potential energy surface (PES)
in multiple dimensions. The number of points we can calculate is limited
by the availability of computer resources. The number of points increases

20

CHAPTER 2. THE DISSOCIATION OF METHANE

dramatically with the dimensionality of the dynamical system. Computer
resources limits also the dimensionality and the time-scale of the dynamics
simulation itself.

2.3.1 Electronic structure calculations

A convenient way of performing electronic structure calculations involving
metal atoms is by using density functional theory (DFT). Full conﬁgurational
interaction (CI) are too hard to perform, since the metal atoms in the surface
model consist of too many electrons. The surface can be either modeled as a
cluster of a few metal atoms or as a periodic slab consisting of a few layers of
metal atoms.

The ﬁrst electronic structure calculations of methane dissociation were self
consisted ﬁeld (SCF) calculations on Ni(111) and substitutional Fe/Ni(111)
clusters [?, ?]. We performed in our group DFT calculation on Ni and Co
clusters [?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?]. Others have done the same on various clusters of Ru,
Os, Rh, Ir, Pd, Pt, Cu, Ag, and Au [?, ?, ?, ?].

DFT calculations on periodic slabs have studied the methane dissociation
reaction on pure and gold-alloyed Ni(111) [?], Ni(100) and Ni(111) with pread-
sorbed potassium [?,?], Ru(0001) [?,?], and Ir(111) [?] surfaces. The obtained
transition state for CH4 dissociation on Ni(111) involves considerable internal
excitation of the molecule [?]. The breaking of the C–H bond occurs prefer-
entially on top of a Ni atom, with a dissociation barrier of about 100 kJ/mol.
The reaction coordinate is mainly a C–H stretch.

There is also calculated a PES for the methyl radical and methane in
interaction with nickel surfaces based on the embedded diatomics-in-molecules
(EDIM) formalism, which involves mixing the semi-empirical diatomics-in-
molecules (DIM) valence bond method for the covalent part of the system
with the embedded atom method (EAM) for the metal [?].

2.3.2 Dynamics simulations

Wave packet simulations are being used more and more to study the dynamics
of molecule surface reactions. A lot of progress have been made over the decade
especially for the reaction of H2 on metal surfaces [?, ?]. It is very interesting
to simulate the dynamics of the dissociation, because of the direct dissociation
mechanism, and the role of the internal vibrations. The published wave packet
simulations on the methane dissociation reaction on transition metals have
treated the methane molecule always as a diatomic up to now [?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?].
Besides the C–H bond and molecule surface distance, a combination of other

REFERENCES

21

coordinates were included, like (multiple) rotations and some lattice motion.
None of them have looked at the role of the other internal vibrations.

The ﬁrst model included the C–H bond, the molecule surface distance,
and a dynamic surface. It has been used for comparison of molecular beam
experiments of the dissociation of methane on Pt(111) [?,?,?], and Ni(100) [?].
The second included a rotational degree of freedom, but left out the dynamical
surface for a study on Ni(111) [?]. Both models found that the dissociation
occurs via a tunneling mechanism.

The most recent wave packet simulation on the dissociation probability of
CH4 and CD4 on Ni(100) used both a dynamic surface and rotational freedom.
It showed a semiquantitative agreement between the theoretical results and
the experiments of Ref. [?], except for the isotope eﬀect and the extracted
vibrational eﬃcacy [?]. One of the possible explanation of the incorrect isotope
eﬀect can be the role played by the non-included intramolecular vibrations.

Finally, I like to mention that there have also been performed some classical

stochastic trajectory simulations [?, ?].

Wave packet simulations

We have used the multi-conﬁgurational time-dependent Hartree
(MCTDH) method for our wave packet simulations, because it can
deal with a large number of degrees of freedom and with large grids.
We have developed four eﬃcient model potentials for this method
for studying the full vibrational scattering of oriented methane on a
ﬂat surface. We have described the MCTDH method and the model
potentials for the simulations discussed in the next three chapters.

3.1

Introduction

Every wave packet simulation consist of three parts. First we have to deﬁne
the potential energy surface (PES) and generate an intial state (wave packet)
of the system. Secondly we have to propagate the wave packet during a certain
time. Finally we have to analyse the ﬁnal and intermediate states of the wave
packets.

A general problem of computer simulations is that the size and simula-
tion time of the system under study is limited by the available computational
resources. Wave packet simulations are mainly limited by the number of di-
mensions, because the total number of grid point for the numerical integration
scales with the product of the number of grid points per dimension. This means
that we have to keep the system small (typically 6 dimensions or less) or we
have to use a computational trick. We did both. We reduced the dimension-
ality to ten by leaving out three rotional and two translational coordinates of
methane. The computational trick is that we used an approximation method
for our wave packet propagation for which the total number of grid points
scales with the sum of the number of grid points per dimension.

CHAPTER 3. WAVE PACKET SIMULATIONS

The published wave packet simulations on the methane dissociation re-
action on transition metals have treated the methane molecule always as a
diatomic up to now [?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?]. Besides the C–H bond and molecule sur-
face distance, a combination of other coordinates were included, like (multiple)
rotations and some lattice motion. None of them have looked at the role of
the other internal vibrations.

We are not able yet to simulate the dissociation including all internal vi-
brations. Instead we have simulated the scattering of methane, for which all
internal vibrations can be included. We deduce the consequences for the dis-
sociation at of them. In this chapter I will give the theoretical background
and computational details of our wave packet simulations of the scattering of
ﬁxed oriented methane on a ﬂat surface described in the Chapters 4, 5, and
6.
I describe our wave packet propagation method ﬁrst. Then the various
potential energy surfaces (PESs) that we have used are derived. (A harmonic
intramolecular PES is adapted to include anharmonicities in the C–H/D dis-
tance, the decrease of C–H/D bond energy due to interactions with the sur-
face, and the increase of C–H/D bond length also due to interactions with the
surface.) I end with a description of the initial states.

3.2 The MCTDH Method

The multi-conﬁgurational time-dependent Hartree (MCTDH) method is an
approximation method, which has like every approximation method advan-
tages and disadvantages. Its main advantages are that it can be several or-
ders of magnitude faster than conventional methods, and it requires a very
small amount of memory. It is especially very usefull if it has to deal with
large number of degrees of freedom and with large grids. The main dis-
advantage is that the MCTDH method requires the Hamiltonian to be ex-
panded as a sum of products of one-particle operators. Normally the kinetic
energy is already in the right form. The potential is often only in such a
form when considering model problems. So most of the time it is necessary
to transform a potential to MCTDH. Since the computation time grows lin-
early with the number of Hamiltonian terms, the MCTDH method can be-
come slow, if an accurate transformation requires a lot of potential terms.
Another drawback of this is that the MCTDH method is only fast if the
time dependent wavepacket can be expanded into a small product basis set.
The MCTDH method has been applied successfully to gas phase reactions
and reactions at surfaces, and further method development is still going on
[?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?].

3.2. THE MCTDH METHOD

29

It has been reviewed recently in Ref. [?].

We give here a short overview of the MCTDH formalism for completeness.
More details can be found in Refs. [?] and [?]. The exact wave-function of a
D-dimensional system, is approximated by an expression of the form

ΨMCTDH(q1, . . . , qD; t) =

cn1...nD (t) ψ(1)

n1 (q1; t) . . . ψ(D)

nD (qD; t).

(3.1)

n1...nD
X

From this expression, it is possible to obtain the equations of motion for
the one-dimensional functions ψ(i)
ni (qi; t) and for the correlation coeﬃcients
cn1...nD (t). Without loss of generality we can choose the ψ(i)
ni ’s to be natural
single-particle states [?]. They insure that we obtain the best approximation
to the exact Ψ(q1, . . . , qD; t) for a ﬁxed number of conﬁgurations; i.e., they
minimize the expression

where

and where Ψ is the exact wave-function. The natural single-particle functions
are eigenstates of the reduced density operators.

The equations of motions for the natural single-particle states can be obtained
by diﬀerentiation of the eigenvalue equation:

Equations (3.5) and (3.10) are a particular form of the more general equations
obtained from a time-dependent variational principle [?]. They conserve the
norm of the wave-function and the mean energy of a time-independent Hamil-
tonian. The resulting system of ﬁrst-order diﬀerential equations, has to be
solved with a general-purpose integrator. We used the variable-order variable-
step Adams method, as implemented in the NAG library [?]. This method
gave good convergence for all described simulations. The singularities in Eqs.
(3.5), (3.6), and (3.10) have been treated numerically by the regularization
procedure described in Ref. [?].

The natural single-particle states have some small advantages over other
possible choices of single-particle states. The most important one is that one
˜ψ(i)
can directly see from
how well ΨMCTDH approximates the exact

wave-function. How much a natural single-particle functions contributes to
the wave-function is given by the eigenvalue ν(i)

3.3 Potential energy surfaces

The PESs we used for our wavepacket simulations (as described in Chapters 4,
5, and 6) can all be written as

Vtotal = Vintra + Vsurf ,

(3.11)

where Vintra is the intramolecular PES and Vsurf is the repulsive interaction
with the surface. For the Vintra we looked at four diﬀerent types of PESs. Two
of the four diﬀerent PESs include changes in the intramolecular potential due
to interactions with the surface in Vintra.

the summation is over the internal vibrations, Xi’s are mass-weighted displace-
ment coordinates and ki are mass-weighted force constants. (see Table 3.1 for
deﬁnitions and values); (X1 is the mass-weighted overall translation along the
surface normal) [?]. The force constants have been obtained by ﬁtting them
on the experimental vibrational frequencies of CH4 and CD4 [?, ?].

We have assumed that the repulsive interaction with the surface is only
through the hydrogen or deuterium atoms that point towards the surface. We
take the z-axis as the surface normal. In this case the surface PES is given by

Vsurf =

Xi=1

(3.13)

where NH is the number of hydrogens or deuteriums that points towards the
surface, α=1.0726 atomic units and A=6.4127 Hartree. These parameters are
chosen to give the same repulsion as the PES that has been used in an MCTDH
wavepacket simulation of CH4 dissociation [?].

3.3.2 An anharmonic intramolecular potential

Even though we do not try to describe the dissociation of methane in this
paper, we do want to determine which internal vibration might be important
for this dissociation. The PES should at least allow the molecule to partially
distort as when dissociating. The harmonic PES does not do this. A number
of changes have therefor been made. The ﬁrst is that we have describe the
C–H/D bond by a Morse PES.

although we have only changed the PES of the bond lengths, the ν4 umbrella
modes are also aﬀected. This is because these modes are not only bending,
but also contain some changes of bond length.

where Vharm is as given in Eq. (3.12) and Vcorr is the quadratic part of VMorse,
which is already in Vharm. Figure 3.2(b) shows a contour plot of the cross-
section of this total anharmonic PES with one hydrogen pointing towards the
surface in the translational mode X1 and the ν3 asymmetrical stretch mode
X4. (We would like to point out that there are, of course, various anharmonic
PESs for methane in the literature. There are two reasons why we haven’t
use them. First, these PESs are not in appropriate form to use then with the
MCTDH method [?, ?]. Second, these PESs are generally quite complicated.
We prefer to keep it as simple as possible, because at this moment we’re only
interested in qualitative eﬀects.)

3.3.3 Intramolecular potential with weakening bonds

When the methane molecule approach the surface the overlap of substrate
orbitals and anti-bonding orbitals of the molecule weakens the C–H bonds.
We want to include this eﬀect for the C–H bonds of the hydrogens pointing
towards the surface. We have redeﬁned the VMorse given in Eq. (3.18) and also
replace it in Eq. (3.19). A sigmoidal function is used to switch from the gas
phase C–H bond to a bond close to the surface. We have used the following,
somewhat arbitrary, approximations. (i) The point of inﬂection should be at
a reasonable distance from the surface. It is set to the turnaround point for
a rigid methane molecule with translation energy 93.2 kJ/mol plus twice the
fall-oﬀ distance of the interaction with the surface. (ii) The depth of the PES
of the C–H bond is 480 kJ/mol in the gas phase, but only 93.2 kJ/mol near
the surface. The value 93.2 kJ/mol corresponds to the height of the activation
barrier used in our dissociation [?]. (iii) The exponential factor is the same as
for the interaction with the surface.

If we transform to normal-mode coordinates for the particular orientations,

CHAPTER 3. WAVE PACKET SIMULATIONS

3.3.4 Intramolecular potential with elongation of the bond

A weakened bond generally has not only a reduced bond strength, but also an
increased bond length. We include the eﬀect of the elongation of the C–H/D
bond length of the hydrogens or deuteriums that point towards the surface
due to interactions with the surface. We have redeﬁned the VMorse given in
Eq. (3.18) and also replace it in Eq. (3.19) for this type of PES. We have
used the following approximations: (i) The transition state, as determined
by Refs. [?, ?], has a C–H bond that is 0.54 ˚A longer than normal. This
elongation should occur at the turn around point for a rigid methane molecule
with a translation energy of 93.2 kJ/mol. (ii) The exponential factor is again
the same as for the interaction with the surface.

If we transform to normal-mode coordinates for the particular orientations,

then we obtain

X4, and Fig. 3.3 shows a contour plot of a cross-section in the translational X1
and the ν1 symmetrical stretch mode X2 in the three diﬀerent orientations.

·

·

Finally we like to note that the monotonic behaviour of all PES types in
the translational mode does not contradict with the fact that the dissociative
adsorption of methane is activated. The activation barrier for dissociative
adsorption in the translational mode is situated in a region with very high
excitations of the stretch modes, which we do not reach in these simulations.

where σ is the width of the wave-packet (we used σ = 320.248 atomic units),
X0 is the initial position (we used X0 = 11σ, which is far enough from the
surface to observe no repulsion) and P1 is the initial momentum. We performed
simulations in the energy range of 32 to 96 kJ/mol. We present in Chapters 4
and 5 only the results of 96 kJ/mol (equivalent to P1 = 0.2704 atomic units),
because they showed the most obvious excitation probabilities for VMorse. We
used seven natural single-particle states, 512 grid points and a grid-length of
15σ for the translational coordinate. With this grid-width we can perform
simulation with a translational energy up to 144 kJ/mol.

Gauss-Hermite discrete-variable representations (DVR) [?] were used to
represent the wavepackets of the vibrational modes. We used for all simu-
lations 5 DVR points for the ν2 bending modes and 8 DVR points for the
ν4 umbrella, ν3 asymmetrical stretch, and ν1 symmetrical stretch mode for
an numerical exact integration, except for the simulations with Vshift, where
we used 16 DVR points for the ν1 symmetrical stretch mode, because of the
change in the equilibrium position.

We did the simulation with one hydrogen pointing towards the surface in
eight dimensions, because the ν2 bending modes X5 and X6 do not couple
with the other modes. We needed four natural single-particle states for modes
X2, X3 and X4, and just one for the others. So the number of conﬁgurations
was 71
14 = 448. The simulation with two hydrogens pointing towards
the surface was performed in nine dimensions. One of the ν2 bending mode
(X6) does not couple with the other modes, but for the other mode X5 we
needed four natural single-particle states. The number of conﬁgurations was
71
14 = 1792, because we needed the same number of natural single-particle
states as mentioned above for the other modes. We needed ten dimensions to
perform the simulation with three hydrogens pointing towards the surface. We
used here one natural single-particle state for the modes X5 to X10 and four
natural single-particle states for X2 to X4, which gave us 71
16 = 448
conﬁgurations.

Vibrational scattering of
methane

We present results of wavepacket simulations of scattering of an
oriented methane molecule from a ﬂat surface including all nine
internal vibrations. At a translational energy up to 96 kJ/mol we
ﬁnd that the scattering is almost completely elastic. Vibrational
excitations when the molecule hits the surface and the correspond-
ing deformation depend on generic features of the potential energy
surface. In particular, our simulation indicate that for methane to
dissociate the interaction of the molecule with the surface should
lead to an elongated equilibrium C–H bond length close to the sur-
face.∗

4.1

Introduction

At the time I started my research, our group had just performed a multi-
conﬁgurational time-dependent Hartree (MCTDH) study of CH4 dissociation
on Ni(111) [?] with a potential energy surface (PES) based on earlier density
functional theory (DFT) calculations within the group [?, ?, ?, ?, ?]. The sim-
ulations included the distance of the methane molecule to the surface, a C–H
distance, and the orientation of methane as coordinates. Previous wavepacket
simulations focused on the molecule-surface and C–H distance too, and com-
bination it with lattice motion on several metals [?, ?, ?]. When I ﬁnished the
simulations described in this chapter, a wave packet simulation of methane

CHAPTER 4. VIBRATIONAL SCATTERING OF METHANE

dissociation on a Ni(111) atop site including all these coordinates [?]. None
of the wavepacket simulations published so far have looked at the role of the
internal vibrations of methane. It was observed experimentally at the time
that vibrationally hot CH4 dissociates more readily than cold CH4, with the
energy in the internal vibrations being about as eﬀective as the translational
energy in inducing dissociation [?, ?, ?, ?, ?]. However, a more detailed assess-
ment of the importance of the internal vibrations could not be made, because
of the large number of internal vibrations. A DFT calculation at that time
also showed that the transition state for CH4 dissociation on Ni(111) involves
considerable internal excitation of the molecule [?].

In this chapter we report on wavepacket simulations that we have done to
determine which and to what extent internal vibrations are important for the
dissociation of methane on transition-metals. We are not able yet to simulate
the dissociation including all internal vibrations. Instead we have simulated
the scattering of methane, for which all internal vibrations can be included. By
looking at vibrational excitations and the deformation of the molecule when it
hits the surface we can derive information that is relevant for the dissociation.
We have used model PESs that have been developed with Ni(111) in mind,
but our results should hold for other surfaces as well. The various model
PESs we have derived are described in Section 3.3 of this thesis. A harmonic
intramolecular PES [Vintra, see Eq.(3.12)] is adapted to include anharmonicities
in the C–H distance [VMorse, see Eq.(3.18)], the decrease of the C–H bond
energy due to interactions with the surface [Vweak, see Eq.(3.20)], and the
increase of the C–H bond length also due to interactions with the surface [Vshift,
see Eq.(3.22)]. We have used the multi-conﬁgurational time-dependent Hartree
(MCTDH) method for our wave packet simulation [?,?]. This method can deal
with a large number of degrees of freedom and with large grids. (See Ref. [?] for
a recent review, or Section 3.2 of this thesis for a survey.) Initial translational
energy has been chosen in the range of 32 to 96 kJ/mol. We present only
the results of the simualtions at 96 kJ/mol here (equivalent to P1 =
0.2704
mass-weighted atomic units), because they showed the most obvious excitation
probabilties for VMorse. The initial state has been written as a product state
of ten functions; one for the normally incident translational coordinate, and
one for each internal vibration. All vibrations were taken to be in the ground
state. Grid methods, number of points, and the conﬁgurational basis have
been described in Section 3.4. The results of the simulations are presented
and discussed next. We focus on excitation probabilities and deformation of
the molecule when it hits the surface. The implications for the dissociation are
discussed separately. We end with a summary and some general conclusions.

4.2. SCATTER PROBABILITIES

4.2 Scatter Probabilities

We found that the scattering is predominantly elastic. The elastic scattering
probability is larger than 0.99 for all orientations and PESs at a translational
energy of 96 kJ/mol, except for the PES with Vshift and three hydrogens point-
ing towards the surface for which it is 0.956. This agrees with the observation
that the translation-vibration coupling is generally small [?].

If we would have wanted to determine the role of the internal vibrations
from the scattering probabilities, we would have to do quite accurate simula-
tions. We have opted instead to look at the molecule when it hits the surface,
which enables us to obtain good results with much less costly simulations.

4.3 Excitation Probabilities

The surface PES has C3v (with one or three hydrogens towards the surface)
or C2v symmetry (with two hydrogens towards the surface).
If we expand
this PES in a Taylor-series of internal vibrations, we see that the linear terms
contain only those vibrations that transform as a1 in C3v, respectively, C2v.
These are therefore easier to excite than others; We did not ﬁnd any appre-
ciable excitation of e modes of C3v and the a2, b1, and b2 modes of C2v.

We will not present results of the simulations with the harmonic PES,
because they give almost the same excitation probabilities as the PES with
VMorse. The maximum excitation probabilities at the surface for the PES with
VMorse are given in Table 4.1. We have observed the highest excitations for
this PES in the ν4 umbrella and ν2 bending modes in the orientation with
two hydrogens, and for the ν4 umbrella mode in the orientation with three
hydrogens pointing towards the surface. The excitation probabilities for the
ν1 and ν3 stretch modes at this orientations are a factor of magnitude lower.
We have observed higher excitation probabilities for the ν1 and ν3 stretch
modes in the one hydrogen orientation. The excitation probability of the ν4
umbrella mode is here lower then for the other orientations, but still in the
same order as the stretch modes for this orientation. This can be explained by
the values of the α’s of Vsurf [see Table 3.2] and the force constants of Vharm [see
Table 3.1], because Vharm is approximately VMorse for the ground state. The
force constants of Vintra for the ν1 symmetrical stretch and ν3 asymmetrical
stretch are of the same order, but the α parameter in Vsurf in the orientation
with one hydrogen pointing towards the surface for the ν3 asymmetrical stretch
is around twice as large as for the ν1 symmetrical stretch, which explains why
ν3 is more excited as ν1. The surface repulsion on the ν4 umbrella mode is

umbrella then in the ν1 symmetrical stretch.

For the orientation with two hydrogens pointing towards the surface the
repulsion on the vibrational modes is for all modes in the same order (ν2
bending a little higher), so the diﬀerence in excitation probabilities correlate
here primarily with the force constants. The force constants of the ν2 bending
and ν4 umbrella modes are of the same order, as are those of ν1 and ν3. The
stretch force constants are higher, however, so that the excitation probabilities
are lower. The repulsion on the ν4 umbrella mode is the largest in the orien-
tation with three hydrogens pointing towards the surface. The force constants
is lower for this modes then for the ν1 and ν3 stretch modes, so the primary
excitation is seen in the ν4 umbrella mode.

For the orientation with three hydrogens pointing towards the surface the
repulsion on the ν4 umbrella mode is the highest in combination with a low
force constant, so this mode has a much higher excitation probability than the
ν1 and ν3 stretch modes. Another interesting detail is that the α3 parameter
is higher for the orientation with two than with three hydrogens pointing

4.3. EXCITATION PROBABILITIES

toward the surface, but the excitation probabilities for the ν4 umbrella in this
orientations are equal. This is caused by a coupling between the excitation of
the ν2 bending and the ν4 umbrella mode in the orientation with two hydrogens
pointing towards the surface.

We observed with Vweak [see Table 4.1] that all excitation probabilities
become much higher than with VMorse, except for the ν4 umbrella mode with
two hydrogens towards the surface, which stays almost the same. It is caused
by the fact that, although the ν1 symmetrical stretch and ν3 asymmetrical
stretch contribute almost completely to VMorse, the ν4 umbrella does so just
for a small part. The ν4 umbrella contributes primarily, and the ν2 bending
completely, to the harmonic terms of intramolecular PES Vintra. Vweak gives
only a lowering in the VMorse terms of Vintra, so we should expect primarily an
higher excitation probability in the ν1 and ν3 stretch modes. This will also
cause a higher excitation probability of the other modes, because the turn-
around point will be some what later, which give eﬀectively more repulsion on
the other modes.

We also observed that for both stretches the excitation probabilities shows
the following trend; three hydrogens < two hydrogens < one hydrogen point-
ing towards the surface. For one hydrogen pointing towards the surface the
excitation probability of the ν3 asymmetrical stretch is around twice that of
the ν1 symmetrical stretch, they are almost equal for two hydrogens, and for
three hydrogens the ν1 is twice the ν3 stretch. Some of these trends can also
be found for the PES with VMorse, but are not always that obvious. They
follow the same trends as the α parameters of Vsurf in Table 3.2.

Vshift [see Table 4.1] gives also higher excitation probabilities for almost
all modes than VMorse, but for the ν2 bending mode in the two hydrogens
pointing towards the surface orientation it became lower. This means that
the repulsion of the surface is here caused for a large part by the Vshift terms
[see Eq. (3.22)], where the ν2 bending modes don’t contribute. It is also in
agreement with the fact that we have observed the excitation maximum earlier,
so the Vsurf repulsion on the ν2 bending modes will be lower. Fig. 3.2 shows
that the repulsion for the PES with Vshift is stronger than for the other three
PESs.

The excitations in the ν1 and ν3 stretch modes are extremely high with
Vshift, because they contribute strongly to the C–H bond elongation. The
trend in the excitation probabilities of the ν1 symmetrical stretch mode is
caused by the number of bonds pointing towards the surface, because the γi2
parameters are for all bonds and orientations the same, so only the strength
of the coupling with the shift-factor dominates. This eﬀect is illustrated in

because there is also diﬀerence between the γi4 parameters as can be seen in
Table 3.4 and 3.5.

4.4 Structure Deformation

If we put the methane molecule far from the surface, then all PESs are iden-
tical. For this situation we calculated a bond distance of 1.165 ˚A and bond
angle of 109.5 degrees in the ground state. The results of the maximum struc-
ture deformations are shown in the Table 4.2. Figure 4.1 shows the names of
the bonds and angles for the three orientations.

We observed that the PESs with VMorse and Vweak give again the same
trends, but that for the PES with Vweak these trends are much stronger. This
is in agreement with the observations discussed for the excitation probabilities
above. The deformations for the PES with Vshift are dominated by the change
of the bond distances for the bonds which are pointing towards the surface.
These bonds become longer for all orientations in the same order. So there

CHAPTER 4. VIBRATIONAL SCATTERING OF METHANE

is no orientational eﬀect and this will be probably caused completely by the
Vshift terms [see Eq. (3.22)].

For the orientation with one hydrogen pointing towards the surface [see
Table 4.2], we observed that the bond pointing towards the surface becomes
shorter, as expected, for the PES with VMorse and even more with Vweak. This
is caused by the repulsion of the Vsurf terms, which works in the direction of
the bond axes. We observed also some small bond angle deformation. This is
probably a secondary eﬀect of the change in the bond distance and correlates
to excitation of the ν4 umbrella mode. Remarkably, for Vshift the bond length
increases. Clearly the eﬀect of the change in equilibrium bond length is more
eﬀective than the repulsion with the surface. The shift eﬀect may be somewhat
too large, but the observed change (0.232 ˚A) is much lower than the shift of
the equilibrium (0.54 ˚A) on which we ﬁtted Vshift.

We also observed for all orientations with Vshift an earlier turn-around
point, which is in agreement with the earlier observed excitation maximum.
This is caused by the extra repulsion contribution in the Vshift terms and by
the longer bond length; a longer bond gives a higher repulsion for the same
position of the center of mass. Fig. 3.2 shows this eﬀect in the ν3 asymmetrical
stretch mode.

The orientation with two hydrogens pointing towards the surface [see Ta-
ble 4.2] gives also shorter bond distances for the bonds pointing towards the
surface for the PESs with VMorse and Vweak, although very little in comparison
to the one hydrogen orientation. We expected this, because just half of the
repulsion is now in the direction of the bonds. The other half is perpendicular
on the C–H bonds and this makes the bond angle larger. The bond angles
between the bonds pointing towards the surface show a quite large deforma-
tion. This was already expected from the excitation of the ν2 bending and ν4
umbrella modes.

We also observed that a smaller bond length of the bonds pointing towards
the surface correlates with a larger bond angle of the angles between the bonds
pointing towards the surface and a higher excitation probability of the ν2
bending mode. This can be explained as follows. When the bonds become
shorter the center of mass can come closer to the surface. Because of this there
will be more repulsion on the ν2 bending mode, which will cause a larger bond
angle deformation.

Most of the deformations of the other bond angles can be explained as an
indirect eﬀect of the deformation of this bond angle, but the deformation of
the angle between the bonds pointing away from the surface which was seen
at the PES with Vshift must be caused by the excitation of the ν4 umbrella

4.5. DISSOCIATION MODELS

mode.

We observed almost no change in bond length for the PESs with VMorse
and Vweak at the three hydrogens towards the surface orientation [see Table
4.2]. Almost all energy is absorbed by the ν4 umbrella mode, so this gives
quite large bond angle deformations. The bond angle deformation is larger for
the PES with Vweak than with VMorse PES; in agreement with higher excitation
probability for the PES with Vweak. The PES with Vshift has around the same
excitation probabilities for the ν4 umbrella mode as the PES with Vweak, but
the bond angle deformation is the same as for the PES with VMorse. This may
be caused by the higher excitations of the ν1 and ν3 stretch modes and the
longer bonds pointing towards the surface at the PES with Vshift, which can
make it harder to deform the bond angles.

4.5 Dissociation models

Several dissociation mechanisms for direct methane dissociation on transition
metals have been suggested. All proposals can be related to two main ideas.
One of them is the breaking of a single C–H bond in the initial collision. [?, ?]
This model is most suggested in literature and also all wavepacket simulations
have focussed on the eﬀects of this model. [?, ?, ?, ?, ?] The other mechanism
is often called “splats” and suggests that the critical requirement for methane
dissociation is angular deformation of methane which allows a Ni–C bond to
form. [?] Even though we did not try to describe the dissociation itself, we
would like to discuss the implication of our simulation for the dissociation.

The “splats” model seems easiest to discuss. Angular deformation is re-
lated to the ν2 bending and the ν4 umbrella mode. The excitation probabilities
in Table 4.1 seem to indicate that these modes are easy to excite, and that
angular deformation should be large. These excitation probabilities are mis-
leading, however. Table 4.2 shows that, although the excitation probabilities
depend on the PES, the changes in the bond angles do not. Moreover, these
changes are quite small. They are largest for the orientation with two hydro-
gen atoms pointing towards to surface, for which they are about 8 degrees at
most. This seems much too small to enable the formation of a Ni–C bond. A
previous estimate of the bond angle deformation gave an energy of 68.1 kJ/mol
to get three hydrogens and the carbon in one plane. This correspond to a bond
angle of 120 degrees. [?] We ﬁnd with three hydrogens pointing towards the
surface that the bond angle only changes to about 112 degrees at the higher
energy of 96 kJ/mol. The reason for this diﬀerence is that for the older esti-
mate it was assumed that all translational energy can be used to deform the

54

CHAPTER 4. VIBRATIONAL SCATTERING OF METHANE

bond angle, whereas Tables 4.1 and 4.2 clearly show that this is not correct.
The excitation probabilities for the stretch modes depend strongly on the
orientation of the molecule and on the PES. For the PESs without a change
of the equilibrium bond length the excitation probabilities are only apprecia-
bly with one hydrogen pointing towards the surface. This is, however, not a
favourable orientation for the dissociation. Moreover, Table 4.2 shows that in
those cases the repulsion with the surface shortens the C–H bond. The same
holds for the orientation with two hydrogens pointing towards the surface,
although to a lesser extent, whereas the bond length changes hardly at all
with three hydrogens pointing towards the surface. This indicates that the
intramolecular PES needs the bond elongation to overcome the repulsion of
the surface that shortens the C–H bond, and to get dissociation. This agrees
completely with electronic structure calculations that yield a late barrier for
dissociation with a very elongated C–H bond. [?,?] The large excitation proba-
bilities for the PES with the elongated equilibrium bond length should not be
over-interpreted, however. They are to be expected even if the molecule stays
in its (shifted) vibrational ground state. More telling is that for this PES we
do ﬁnd at least some inelastic scattering.

4.6 Conclusions

We have done wavepacket simulations on the scattering of methane from a
ﬂat Ni(111) model surface with a ﬁxed orientation with one, two, or three hy-
drogens pointing towards the surface. We used the MCTDH method and four
diﬀerent model PESs for each orientation. We used a translational energy of
up to 96 kJ/mol and all internal vibrations in the ground state. The scattering
was in all cases predominantly elastic.

When the molecule hits the surface, we always observe vibrational excita-
tions of the ν4 umbrella and ν2 bending modes, especially in the orientations
with two or three hydrogens pointing towards the surface. This is due to
a favorable coupling that originates from the repulsive interaction with the
surface, and the low excitation energies. Deformations of the molecule are
predominantly in the bond angles. The changes in the bond angles are, how-
ever, too small to allow for the formation of a Ni–C bond, as suggested in the
“splats” model of methane dissociation.

Appreciable excitations of the ν1 and ν3 stretch modes when methane hits
the surface are only observed when one hydrogen atom points towards the
surface, or when the intramolecular PES has an elongated equilibrium C–
H bond length close to the surface. The repulsion of the surface shortens

REFERENCES

55

the C–H bond. This can only be overcome when the intramolecular PES
incorporates the eﬀect of a longer equilibrium C–H bond length caused by
overlap of occupied surface orbitals with the antibonding orbitals of methane.
This agrees with quantum chemical calculations, which show a late barrier for
dissociation.

The simulations with these model PESs show that the internal vibrations
play an important role in the dissociation mechanism. Excitation probabili-
ties when the molecule hits the surface show how the translational energy is
converted into vibrational energy and it is distributed over the internal modes.
These probabilities vary strongly with the PES. As only few internal vibra-
tions contribute to the dissociation, it is important to obtain more information
on the real PES for this system.

The isotope eﬀect

The isotope eﬀect in the scattering of methane is studied by wave
packet simulations of oriented CH4 and CD4 molecules from a ﬂat
surface including all nine internal vibrations. At a translational
energy up to 96 kJ/mol we ﬁnd that the scattering is still predomi-
nantly elastic, but less so for CD4. Energy distribution analysis of
the kinetic energy per mode and the potential energy surface terms,
when the molecule hits the surface, are used in combination with
vibrational excitations and the corresponding deformation. They
indicate that the orientation with three bonds pointing towards the
surface is mostly responsible for the isotope eﬀect in the methane
dissociation.∗

Introduction

A nice way to study reaction dynamics is the use of isotopes. The most
recent wave packet simulation on the dissociation probability of CH4 and CD4
showed a semiquantitative agreement with the molecular beam experiments of
Ref. [?], except for the isotope eﬀect and the extracted vibrational eﬃcacy [?].
The molecular beam study with laser excitation of the ν3 asymmetrical stretch
mode shows that the incorrect vibrational eﬃcacy is caused by the assumptions
in the ﬁt procedure that both stretch modes behaves indentical [?]. One of
the possible explanation of the incorrect isotope eﬀect can be the role played
by the non-included intramolecular vibrations.

CHAPTER 5. THE ISOTOPE EFFECT

In this chapter we report wave packet simulations of CD4 scattering in-
cluding all internal vibrations for ﬁxed orientations, performed on the same
model PESs as in the previous chapter for CH4, which have been described in
Section 3.3. A harmonic intramolecular PES [Vintra, see Eq.(3.12)] is adapted
to include anharmonicities in the C–H distance [VMorse, see Eq.(3.18)], the
decrease of the C–H bond energy due to interactions with the surface [Vweak,
see Eq.(3.20)], and the increase of the C–H bond length also due to interac-
tions with the surface [Vshift, see Eq.(3.22)]. We have used the multi-conﬁ-
gurational time-dependent Hartree (MCTDH) method for our wave packet
simulation [?, ?]. This method can deal with a large number of degrees of
freedom and with large grids. (See Ref. [?] for a recent review, or Section 3.2
of this thesis for a survey.) Initial translational energy has been chosen in
the range of 32 to 96 kJ/mol. We present only the results of the simualtions
at 96 kJ/mol here (equivalent to P1 =
0.2704 mass-weighted atomic units),
because they showed the most obvious excitation probabilties for VMorse. The
initial state has been written as a product state of ten functions; one for the
normally incident translational coordinate, and one for each internal vibration.
All vibrations were taken to be in the ground state. Grid methods, number of
points, and the conﬁgurational basis have been described in Section 3.4.

−

We will discuss the vibrational excitation and the deformation of the CD4
molecule when it hits the surface and compare it with CH4. Later on we will
look at the energy distribution of the kinetic energy per mode and the poten-
tial energy in some terms of our model PESs for both isotopes. The transfer of
translational kinetic energy towards vibrational kinetic energy gives an indica-
tion about the dissociation probability, since vibrational kinetic energy helps
in overcoming the dissociation barrier. It gives a better idea too about which
modes are essential to include in a more accurate wave packet simulation of
methane dissociation. After that we will discuss the implications of this for
the dissociation and give a summary with some general conclusions.

5.2 Excitation probabilities and structure deforma-

tion of CD4

The scattering probabilities for CD4 are predominantly elastic, as we also
found in our previous simulations of CH4 scattering.
(See Chapter 4 and
Ref. [?]) The elastic scattering probability is larger than 0.99 for all orientation
of the PESs with VMorse and Vweak at a translational energy of 96 kJ/mol. For
the PES with Vshift we observe an elastic scattering probability of 0.981 for the
orientation with one, 0.955 with two and 0.892 with three deuteriums pointing

5.2. EXCITATIONS AND STRUCTURE DEFORMATION

59

towards the surface. This is lower than we have found for CH4, which is 0.956
for the orientation with three hydrogens pointing towards the surface and
larger than 0.99 for the others. The higher inelastic scattering probabilities
of CD4 was expected, because the force constants ki of CD4 are decreased up
to 50% with respect to those of CH4 and the translational surface repulsion
fall-oﬀ diﬀers only little.

Since the inelastic scattering probabilities are generally small, we have
opted to look at the molecule when it hits the surface. Excitation probabil-
ities and structure deformation enable us to get good results with much less
costly simulations. The surface PES has C3v (with one or three bonds towards
the surface) or C2v symmetry (with two bonds towards the surface). If we ex-
pand this PES in a Taylor-series of internal vibrations, we see that the linear
terms contain only those vibrations that transform as a1 in C3v, respectively,
C2v. These are therefore easier to excite than others; We have not ﬁnd any
appreciable excitation of e modes of C3v and the a2, b1, and b2 modes of C2v.
We did not present results of the simulations with the harmonic PES,
because they give almost the same excitation probabilities as the PES with
VMorse. When we compare the excitation probabilities of CD4 in Table 5.1
with CH4 in Table 4.1 (see also Ref. [?]), we see that most of the modes
at the diﬀerent orientations give also a higher excitation probability similar
to the scattering probability. We also see that some modes give a lower or
equal excitation probability than for CH4 scattering. This is caused by the
fact that the force constants ki, the surface repulsion parameters αi and βi,
and the γi,j Morse bond-potential values changed relatively to each other. As
a consequence of that some modes are more preferred for absorbing energy,
which leaves less energy for others. So the isotope eﬀect gives besides a general
higher excitation probability also a diﬀerent excitation probability distribution
over the modes. We will now discuss this in more detail for the three diﬀerent
orientations and model PESs in combination with the structure deformation.

For the PESs with VMorse and Vweak we ﬁnd that the excitation probabilities
of the ν3 stretch for CD4 stays almost the same for all orientations compared
to CH4, except for the orientation with one deuterium pointing towards the
surface with the Vweak PES for which it becomes 0.054 higher (see Table 5.1).
In orientation with C3v symmetry most of the extra excitation is absorbed
by the ν4 umbrella mode. Remarkable is that for the orientation with two
deuteriums pointing towards the surface excitation probabilities of this mode
become lower than for the CH4 scattering. Even the excitation probability for
the Vweak PES of this mode is lower than for the VMorse PES, while normally
this excitation is preferred for the PES with VMorse. One of the reasons is that

for this orientation most of the extra excitation probability is taken by the
ν2 bending mode. We also see that there is a higher excitation probability in
ν1 symmetrical stretch mode for these PESs in all orientations. If we observe
an extra excitation probability for a mode then this is relatively more for the
PES with VMorse than with Vweak.

As a consequence of the extra excitation in the ν4 umbrella mode in the
orientations with C3v symmetry we observe also more bond angle deformation
for these PESs (see Table 5.2). It is also remarkable that the diﬀerence between
the bond angle deformation between the PES with VMorse and Vweak in the
orientation with three deuterium pointing towards the surface is much smaller
than we saw for CH4 scattering. So the weakening of the bond strength is less
eﬀective for CD4 than CH4.

We also see this eﬀect in the orientation with two deuteriums pointing
towards the surface. The bond angle deformation of the angle between the
C–D bond pointing towards the surface has also become lower than we had
observed for CH4. The loss of excitation of the ν4 umbrella mode is not
recovered by the extra excitation of the ν2 bending mode. On the other
hand, as a consequence of this, the angle between the C–D bonds pointing

away from the surface becomes more deformed, because excitation of the ν4
umbrella mode decreases this bond angle and the ν2 bending mode increases
it.

The bond distances for all orientations and the PESs with VMorse and Vweak
are generally somewhat lower for CD4 than CH4, but this in the same order as
we get for the gas phase bond distance (0.004 ˚A). So the isotope eﬀect primary
eﬀects the bond angle deformation for these PES types.

For the PES with Vshift we do not observe this eﬀect on the bond angle
deformation. The bond angle deformation for the orientation with two and
three deuteriums pointing towards the surface is the same as for CH4 and it is
just 0.1◦ less for the bond angle at the surface side in the orientation with one
deuterium pointing towards the surface. The excitation probabilities for the
ν2 bending and ν4 umbrella modes become higher for all orientations for CD4,
which is necessary for getting the same bond angle deformations as CH4.

The changes in the bond distances for the orientations with one and two
bonds pointing towards the surface is for CD4 almost the same as for CH4. For
the orientation with three bonds pointing towards the surface, we found that
the maximum bond lengthening of the bonds on the surface side was 0.032

CHAPTER 5. THE ISOTOPE EFFECT

˚A less for CD4 than CH4. We also found that the bond shortening of the
bond pointing away from the surface is 0.010 ˚A more for CD4. These are only
minimal diﬀerences, which also only suggest that the bond deformation for
CD4 has been inﬂuenced slightly more by the ν3 asymmetrical stretch mode
than the ν1 symmetrical stretch mode. The observed excitation probabilities
for these modes do not contradict this, but are not reliable enough for hard
conclusions because of their high magnitude. It is also not clear, beside of this
problem, what they really represent. Is the excitation caused by a diﬀerent
equilibrium position of the PES at the surface in a mode or is caused by extra
energy in this mode? To answer these questions we decided to do an energy
distribution analysis during the scattering for both isotopes.

5.3 Energy distribution in CH4 and CD4

For an analysis of the isotope eﬀect in the scattering of methane in more detail
and to be able to discuss some possible implications of this for the dissociation
probabilities of both isotopes, we did an analysis of the energy distribution
during the scattering of CD4 and CH4 for all presented orientations and po-
tentials in Section 3.3. (See also Refs. [?, ?]).

We do this by calculating the expectation values of the important term of
the Hamiltonian H [see Eq. (3.8)] for the wave-function Ψ(t) at a certain time
t. We can obtain good information about the energy distribution per mode
per mode j
by looking at the kinetic energy expectation values
(see Tables 5.3 and 5.4), because the kinetic energy operators hj have no cross
terms like the PESs have. When we discuss the kinetic energy of a mode we
normally refer to the a1 mode of the C3v or C2v symmetry, because in these
modes we have observed the highest excitation probabilities and the change
in kinetic energy in the other modes is generally small.

the kinetics of the scattering is driven by the PES. The Vsurf PES [see Eqs.

monic terms of the intramolecular PES of the a1 modes in the C3v and C2v
symmetry corresponding to a ν2 bending and ν4 umbrella modes, respectively.
The pure harmonic correction terms of Vcorr [see Eq. (3.19)] are included in
them. Vbond(Rup) and Vbond(Rdown) are the potential energy in a single C–H
or C–D bond pointing respectively towards and away from the surface, and we
give the expectation value of one bond term of VMorse [see Eq. (3.18)], Vweak

[see Eq. (3.20)] or Vshift [see Eq. (3.22)]. All given expectation values are the
maximum deviation of the initial values, which eﬀectively means the values at
the moment the molecule hits the surface.

The largest changes in expectation values are, of course, in the kinetic
energy of the translational mode. The translational kinetic energy does not
become zero as we should expect in classical dynamics. The loss of trans-
lational kinetic energy is primary absorbed by the Vsurf terms of the PESs.
The expectation values of the Vsurf terms show the ability of the hydrogens or
deuteriums to come close to the metal surface, since in real space their expo-
nential fall-oﬀs are the same for both isotopes. For a rigid molecule the sum of
the translational kinetic energy and Vsurf should be constant, so all deviations
of this sum have to be found back in the intramolecular kinetic energy and
other PES terms.

The minimum expectation values of the translational kinetic energy for a
given orientation and PES is always larger for CH4 than CD4. We observe
that for the PES with VMorse and Vweak the expectation value of Vsurf is higher
for CD4 than CH4, so it is easier for the deuterium to come close to the

surface then for the hydrogens. This is the other way around for the PES with
Vshift. So we ﬁnd with Vshift CH4 has both a higher Vsurf and kinetic energy
expectation value than CD4.

We see for CD4 with the VMorse PES in all orientations about the same
translational energy. For CH4 this is only true for the orientation with one
and two hydrogens pointing towards the surface, because we found in the
orientation with three hydrogens pointing towards the surface the translational
energy at the surface is twice that in the other orientations. This is the largest
diﬀerence we have found between the isotopes. We observe for all modes a
little more kinetic vibrational energy than in the groundstate for both isotopes,
but in the ν1 stretch term the extra kinetic energy is twice as high for CH4
as CD4. The absolute value of the Vharm(ν4) PES term of CD4 has become
even higher than CH4 in the orientation with three bonds pointing towards
the surface. This explains the 1.2 degrees higher bond angle deformation of
CD4 in this orientation.

For the orientations with one and two bonds pointing towards the surface
we observe slightly more kinetic energy in the vibrational modes and the har-

monic PES terms become higher. In the orientation with one bond pointing
towards the surface we observe a higher value for the Vbond(Rdown) PES term.
This is of course caused by the repulsion of Vsurf , which also lead to a shorter
bond distance and because of that to higher contribution of the repulsion term
of VMorse.

The PES with Vweak shows for both isotopes an upward trend in kinetic
energy in the translational mode and the surface repulsion Vsurf terms with the
number bonds pointing towards the surface. Although the sum of these values
for the orientation with one bond pointing towards the surface are still lower
than the value of the initial translational energy, the kinetic energy in the
stretch modes becomes lower. This is also observed in the e modes in the C3v
symmetry, and b1 and b2 modes in the C2v symmetry of the ν3 asymmetrical
stretch modes. It is caused by the ﬂattening of the bond potential close to the
surface. The Vbond(Rdown) and Vharm(ν4) terms have to compensate this lost
of energy by increasing more than with the PES with VMorse. The increase for
CD4 in these terms is higher than for CH4. The value of the Vharm(ν4) became

even the highest for CD4.

For the orientations with two and three bonds pointing towards the surface
we observe that the sum of the translational kinetic energy and Vsurf terms
become higher than the initial kinetic energy . This is compensated by a loss
of vibrational kinetic energy in all stretch modes and a lost of the Vbond(Rdown)
terms of the PES. The Vharm(ν2) and Vharm(ν4) become higher or stay around
the same value compared with the PES with VMorse. In the orientation with
two bonds pointing towards the surface we also observe a higher value for the
Vbond(Rup) term for both isotopes.

Since we found for the PES with Vshift both the translational kinetic energy
and the Vsurf terms were higher for CH4 than CD4, we have to ﬁnd more
increase in energy in the intramolecular modes and PES terms for CD4 than
CH4. We indeed do so and that can be one of the reasons we found higher
inelastic scatter probabilities for CD4 with this type of model PES.

For the orientations with one and two bonds pointing towards the surface
we observe a large increase of the kinetic energy in the ν3 asymmetrical stretch

5.3. ENERGY DISTRIBUTION IN CH4 AND CD4

67

mode. The translational kinetic energy becomes much higher than with the
other model PESs for these orientations, especially in the orientation with one
bond pointing towards the surface.
If we compare this with the excitation
probabilities, we ﬁnd that the kinetic energy analysis gives indeed a diﬀerent
view on the dynamics. For the orientation with two bond pointing towards the
surface we have found for both isotopes very high excitation probabilities in the
ν1 and ν3 stretch modes. We know now from the kinetic energy distribution
that for the ν1 symmetrical stretch mode the high excitation probability is
caused by the change of the equilibrium position of the ν1 mode in the PES
and that for the ν3 stretch mode probably the PES also has become narrower.
For the orientation with three bonds pointing towards the surface we also
obtain an large increase of the kinetic energy of the ν3 asymmetrical stretch
mode, but we also ﬁnd an even larger increase in the kinetic energy of the ν1
symmetrical stretch mode. The total kinetic energy was extremely large, be-
cause the kinetic energy of the translational mode becomes also much larger
than for the other orientations. Because of this the Vsurf terms had to be
around twice as low as for the other orientations. This means that it is un-
favourable to get the hydrogens and deuterium close to the surface in this
orientation with this PES type.

All Vbond(Rup) terms of the PES with Vshift become lower compared to the
initial value, especially in the orientation with two bond pointing towards the
surface. In the orientation with one bond pointing towards the surface, the
Vbond(Rdown) term became higher. Again this is caused by the repulsion of
Vsurf in the direction of the bond. For CH4 however it stays lower than the
values for the other model PESs. The increase of this PES term value is higher
for CD4 and we can ﬁnd it above the value of the PES with VMorse, but still
much lower than for the PES with Vweak.

In the orientation with three bond pointing towards the surface we also
observe a higher Vbond(Rdown) value, with also the highest increase for CD4.
In relation with the somewhat shorter bond distance for the Rdown for CD4
compared with CH4, which was also a bit lower compared with the other
orientations, we know now that the hydrogens and especially the deuterium
have problems in following the minimum energy path of the PES with Vshift
during the scattering dynamics. This leads to higher kinetic energy in the
vibrational modes, which results in more inelastic scattering.

The Vharm(ν2) term of the PESs with Vshift increases in respect to the
initial value, but not as much as with the other PES types. The increase of
the Vharm(ν4) is for the orientation with one bond pointing towards the surface
in between the values of the other PES types. In the other orientations it is

68

CHAPTER 5. THE ISOTOPE EFFECT

higher, especially in the orientation with two hydrogens pointing towards the
surface. The values for the CD4 isotopes are also higher than for CH4. We
observe also a larger increase of the kinetic energy in the ν4 umbrella mode
for CD4 than for CH4.

5.4 Dissociation hypotheses

We like now to discuss some possible implications of the scattering simulation
for the isotope eﬀect on the dissociation of methane. In Chapter 4 we have
already drawn some conclusions about the possible reaction mechanism and
which potential type would be necessary for dissociation. (See also Ref. [?]).
We found the direct breaking of a single C–H bond in the initial collision more
reasonable than the splats model with single bond breaking after an interme-
diary Ni–C bond formation as suggested by Ref. [?], because the bond angle
deformations seems to small to allow a Ni–C to form. From the simulations
with CD4 we can draw the same conclusions. The PES with Vshift gives the
same angle deformations for both isotopes, which is not suﬃcient for the splats
model. The other potentials give higher bond angle deformations for orien-
tation with three deuteriums pointing towards the surface. If the Ni–C bond
formation would go along this reaction path, then the dissociation of CD4
should be even more preferable than CH4, which is not the case. So we only
have to discuss the implication of the scattering simulation for the dissociation
probabilities of CH4 and CD4 for a direct breaking of a single bond reaction
mechanism. This reaction mechanism can be inﬂuenced by what we will call
a direct or an indirect eﬀect.

A direct eﬀects is the expected changes in the dissociation probability
between CH4 and CD4 for a given orientation. Since we expect that we need
for dissociation a PES with an elongation of the bonds pointing towards the
surface, we only have to look at the isotope eﬀect in the simulation for the
PES with Vshift for diﬀerent orientations to discuss some direct eﬀect. It is
clear from our simulations that the bond lengthening of CD4 is smaller than
CH4 for the orientation with three bonds pointing towards the surface.
If
this orientation has a high contribution to the dissociation of methane, then
this can be the reason of the higher dissociation probability of CH4. In this
case our simulations also explain why Ref. [?] did not observe a high enough
isotope eﬀect in the dissociation probability of their simulation with CH4 and
CD4 modelled by a diatomic, because we do not observe a change in bond
lengthening between the isotopes for the orientation with one bond pointing
towards the surface.

5.4. DISSOCIATION HYPOTHESES

69

The orientation with three bonds pointing towards the surface is also the
orientation with the highest increase of the total vibrational kinetic energy for
the PES with Vshift, because the energy distribution analysis shows besides
an high increase of the kinetic energy in the ν3 asymmetrical stretch mode
also an high increase in the ν1 symmetrical stretch mode. Since vibrational
kinetic energy can be used eﬀectively to overcome the dissociation barrier, the
orientation with three bonds indicates to be a more preferable orientation for
dissociation. Moreover the relative diﬀerence in kinetic energy between both
isotopes is for the ν1 stretch mode larger than for the ν3 stretch mode. If the
kinetic energy in the ν1 stretch mode contributes signiﬁcantly to overcoming
the dissociation barrier, then it is another explanation for the low isotope
eﬀect in Ref. [?].

An indirect eﬀect is the expected changes in the dissociation probability
between CH4 and CD4 through changes in the orientations distribution caused
by the isotope eﬀect in the vibrational modes. This can be the case if the
favourable orientation for dissociation is not near the orientation with three
bonds pointing towards the surface, but more in a region where one or two
bonds pointing towards the surface. These orientations do not show a large
diﬀerence in deformation for the PES with Vshift. We can not draw immediate
conclusion about the indirect eﬀect from our simulations, since we did not
include rotational motion, but our simulation show that an indirect isotope
eﬀect can exist. For the PES with VMorse in the orientation with three bonds
pointing towards the surface, we observe that CD4 is able to come closer to the
surface than CH4. So this rotational orientation should be more preferable for
CD4 than for CH4. On the other hand, if the PES is in this orientation more
like Vshift the dissociation probability in other orientation can be decreased for
CD4 through higher probability in inelastic scattering channels.

So for both eﬀects the behaviour of the orientation with three bonds point-
ing towards the surface seems to be essential for a reasonable description of
the dissociation mechanism of methane. A wave packet simulation of methane
scattering including one or more rotational degrees of freedom and the vibra-
tional stretch modes will be a good starting model to study the direct and
indirect eﬀects, since most of the kinetic energy changes are observed in the
stretch modes and so the bending and umbrella modes are only relevant with
accurate PESs. Eventually dissociation paths can be introduced in the PES
along one or more bonds.

Beside of our descriptions of the possible isotopes eﬀect for the dissocia-
tion extracted of the scatter simulations we have to keep in mind that also
a tunneling mechanism can be highly responsible for the higher observed iso-

70

CHAPTER 5. THE ISOTOPE EFFECT

tope eﬀect in the experiment and that a diﬀerent dissociation barrier in the
simulations can enhance this eﬀect of tunneling.

5.5 Conclusions

We have performed wave packet simulations on the scattering of CD4 from a
ﬂat surface with a ﬁxed orientation with one, two, or three hydrogens point-
ing towards the surface. We used the MCTDH method and three diﬀerent
model PESs for each orientation. We used a translational energy of up to 96
kJ/mol and all internal vibrations in the groundstate. The scattering was in
all cases predominantly elastic. However, the observed inelastic scattering of
CD4 compared with simulation on CH4 is higher for the PES with an elongated
equilibrium bond length close to the surface.

When the molecule hits the surface, we observed in general a higher vibra-
tional excitation for CD4 than CH4. The PES with an elongated equilibrium
bond length close to the surface gives for both isotopes almost the same defor-
mations, although we observe a somewhat smaller bond lengthening for CD4
in the orientation with three bonds pointing towards the surface. The other
model PESs show diﬀerences in the bond angle deformations and in the distri-
bution of the excitation probabilities of CD4 and CH4, especially for the PES
with only an anharmonic intramolecular potential.

Energy distribution analysis proofs observations and hypotheses obtained
from excitation probabilities and structure deformation, and contributes new
information on the scattering dynamics. A high increase of vibrational kinetic
energy results in higher inelastic scattering. The highest increase of vibrational
kinetic energy is found in the ν3 asymmetrical stretch modes for all orientations
and in the ν1 symmetrical stretch mode for the orientation with three bonds
pointing towards the surface, when the PES has an elongated equilibrium bond
length close to the surface.

Our simulations give an indications that the isotope eﬀect in the methane
dissociation is caused mostly by the diﬀerence in the scattering behaviour of
the molecule in the orientation with three bonds pointing towards the surface.
At least multiple vibrational stretch modes should be included for a reasonable
description of isotope eﬀect in the methane dissociation reaction.

CHAPTER 5. THE ISOTOPE EFFECT

The role of vibrational
excitations

The role of vibrational excitation of a single mode in the scattering
of methane is studied by wave packet simulations of oriented CH4
and CD4 molecules from a ﬂat surface. All nine internal vibra-
tions are included. In the translational energy range from 32 up
to 128 kJ/mol we ﬁnd that initial vibrational excitations enhance
the transfer of translational energy towards vibrational energy and
increase the accessibility of the entrance channel for dissociation.
Our simulations predict that initial vibrational excitations of the
asymmetrical stretch (ν3) and especially the symmetrical stretch
(ν1) modes will give the highest enhancement of the dissociation
probability of methane. ∗

Introduction

The dissociative adsorption of methane on transition metals is an important
reaction in catalysis; it is the rate limiting step in steam reforming to pro-
duce syngas, and it is prototypical for catalytic C–H activation. Although the
reaction mechanism has been studied intensively, it is not been fully under-
stood yet. A number of molecular beam experiments in which the dissociation
probability was measured as a function of translational energy have observed
that vibrationally hot CH4 dissociates more readily than cold CH4, with the
energy in the internal vibrations being about as eﬀective as the translational

energy in inducing dissociation [?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?]. Two independent bulb gas
experiment with laser excitation of the ν3 asymmetrical stretch and 2ν4 um-
brella modes on the Rh(111) surface [?], and laser excitation of the ν3 and 2ν3
modes on thin ﬁlms of rhodium [?] did not reveal any noticeable enhancement
in the reactivity of CH4. A recent molecular beam experiment with laser ex-
citation of the ν3 mode did succeed in measuring a strong enhancement of the
dissociation on a Ni(100) surface. However, this enhancement was still much
too low to account for the vibrational activation observed in previous studies
and indicated that other vibrationally excited modes contribute signiﬁcantly
to the reactivity of thermal samples [?].

Wave packet simulations of the methane dissociation reaction on transition
metals have treated the methane molecule always as a diatomic molecule up
to now [?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?]. Apart from one C–H bond (a pseudo-ν3 stretch mode)
and the molecule surface distance, either (multiple) rotations or some lattice
motion were included. None of them have looked at the role of the other
internal vibrations, so there is no model that describes which vibrationally
excited mode might be responsible for the experimental observed vibrational
activation. In previous chapters we have reported on wave packet simulations
to determine which and to what extent internal vibrations are important for
the dissociation of CH4 in the vibrational ground state (Chapter 4, see also
Ref. [?]), and the isotope eﬀect of CD4 (Chapter 5, see also Ref. [?]). We
were not able yet to simulate the dissociation including all internal vibra-
tions. Instead we simulated the scattering of methane, for which all internal
vibrations can be included, and used the results to deduce consequences for
the dissociation. These simulations indicate that for methane to dissociate
the interaction of the molecule with the surface should lead to an elongated
equilibrium C–H bond length close to the surface. In this chapter we report
on new wave packet simulations of the role of vibrational excitations for the
scattering of CH4 and CD4 molecules with all nine internal vibrations. The
dynamical features of these simulations give new insight into the initial steps
of the dissociation process. The conventional explanation is that vibrations
help dissociation by adding energy needed to overcome the dissociation bar-
rier. We ﬁnd that two other new explanations play also a role. One of them is
the enhanced transfer of translational energy into the dissociation channel by
initial vibrational excitations. The other more important explanation is the
increased accessibility of the entrance channel for dissociation.

We have used the multi-conﬁgurational time-dependent Hartree (MCTDH)
method for our wave packet simulation [?, ?]. This method can deal with a
large number of degrees of freedom and with large grids. (See Ref. [?] for a

energy has been chosen in the range of 32 to 128 kJ/mol. The initial state
has been written as a product state of ten functions; one for the normally
incident translational coordinate, and one for each internal vibration. All
vibrations were taken to be in the ground state except one that was put
in the ﬁrst excited state. The orientation of the CH4/CD4 was ﬁxed, and
the vibrationally excited state had a1 symmetry in the symmetry group of
the molecule plus surface (C3v when one or three H/D atoms point towards
the surface, and C2v when two point towards the surface.) The potential-
energy surface is characterised by an elongation of the C–H bonds when the
molecule approaches the surfaces [Vshift, see Eq.(3.22)], no surface corrugation,

The computational details about the conﬁgurational basis and number of grid
points are discussed in Section 3.4. Figure 4.1 illustrates the orientations and

We can obtain a good idea about the overall activation of a mode by looking
for each mode j. Dur-
at the kinetic energy expectation values
ing the scattering process the change in the translational kinetic energy is the
largest. It is plotted in Fig. 6.1 as a function of time for CH4 in the orientation
with three bonds pointing towards the surface with an initial kinetic energy
of 96 kJ/mol and diﬀerent initial vibrational states. When the molecule ap-
proaches the surface the kinetic energy falls down to a minimum value. This
minimum value varies only slightly with the initial vibrational states of the
molecule.

The total loss of translational kinetic energy varies substantially, however.
The initial translational kinetic energy is not conserved. This means that the
vibrational excitation enhances inelastic scattering. Especially an excitation
of the ν1 symmetrical stretch mode and to a lesser extent the ν3 asymmetrical
stretch mode results in an increased transfer of kinetic energy towards the
intramolecular vibrational energy. The inelastic scatter component (the initial
minus the ﬁnal translational energy) for both isotopes in the orientation with
three bonds pointing towards the surface, shows the following trend for the
initial vibrational excitations of the modes; ν1 > ν3 > ν4 > ground state.
CH4 scatters more inelastically than CD4 over the whole calculated range of

ν3 stretch mode. CH4 scatters also more inelastically than CD4 in the ν1
symmetrical stretch mode at higher energies , but at lower energies it scatters
slightly less inelastically. For the molecules with the non-excited state or
an excitation in the ν4 umbrella mode CD4 has a higher inelastic scattering
component than CH4. At an initial translational kinetic energy of 128 kJ/mol
the excitation of the ν4 umbrella mode results in a strong enhancement of the
inelastic scattering component. For CD4 the inelastic scattering component
for the initial excited ν4 umbrella mode can become even larger than that for
the initial excited ν3 stretch mode.

For the orientation with two bonds pointing towards the surface we observe
the same trends for the relation between the inelastic scatter components
and the excited initial vibrational modes, but the inelastic scatter component
are less than half of the values for the orientation with three bonds pointing
towards the surface. Also the excitation of the ν3 asymmetrical stretch modes
results now in a higher inelastic scattering component for CD4 than for CH4.
Excitation of the ν2 bending mode gives a slightly higher inelastic scatter
component than the vibrational ground state.

For the orientation with one bond pointing towards the surface we observe
an even lower inelastic scattering component. At an initial kinetic energy of

Figure 6.2: Vibrational kinetic energy in the ν1 symmetrical stretch mode versus
time for a CH4 molecule with three bonds pointing towards the surface. The initial
translational kinetic energy is 96 kJ/mol.

128 kJ/mol we ﬁnd that both the ν1 and ν3 stretch modes have an inelastic
component of around 6.5 kJ/mol for CD4 and 4.0 kJ/mol for CH4.

At an initial translational energy of 32 kJ/mol we observe for both isotopes
in all orientations a very small increase of translational kinetic energy for
the vibrational excited molecule, which means that there is a net transfer
from intramolecular vibrational energy through the surface repulsion into the
translational coordinate.

6.2.2 Vibrational kinetic energy

There seem to be two groups of vibrations with diﬀerent qualitative behavior
with respect to (de)excitation when the molecule hits the surface. The ﬁrst
group, which we call the “stretch” group, consists of the ν3 asymmetric stretch
mode in any orientation and the ν1 symmetric stretch mode in the orientation
with three hydrogen/deuterium atoms pointing to the surface. Figures 6.2 and
6.3 show the vibrational kinetic energy in the ν1 and ν3 stretch modes respec-
tively versus time for CH4 in the orientation with three bonds to the surface.
The second, called the “bending” group, consists of all bending vibrations and
the ν1 in other orientations. Figure 6.4 shows the vibrational kinetic energy
in the ν4 umbrella mode versus time for the same orientation of CH4.

Figure 6.3: Vibrational kinetic energy in the ν3 asymmetrical stretch mode versus
time for a CH4 molecule with three bonds pointing towards the surface. The initial
translational kinetic energy is 96 kJ/mol.

When the molecule is initially in the vibrational ground state the kinetic
energy in the vibrations increases, reaches a maximum at the turn-around
point, and then drops back almost to the initial level except for a small con-
tribution due to the inelastic scattering component. The vibrations within a
group have very similar amounts of kinetic energy, but the “stretch” group
has clearly a larger inelastic component than the “bending” group, and also
the kinetic energy at the turn-around point is larger. When the molecule has
initially an excitation of a vibration of the “stretch” group then the kinetic en-
ergy of that vibration increases, reaches a maximum at the turn-around point,
and drops to a level lower than it was initially. For an excitation of a vibration
of the “bending” group there is no maximum, but its kinetic energy simply
drops to a lower level. We see that in all cases there is not only a transfer of
energy from the translation to vibrations, but also an energy ﬂow from the
initially excited vibration to other vibrations. However, the total energy of the
vibrational kinetic energy and the intramolecular potential energy increases,
because it has to absorb the inelastic scattering component.

6.2.3 Potential energy of the surface repulsion term

Figure 6.5 shows the (repulsive) interaction with the surface during the scat-
tering process of CH4 at an initial kinetic energy of 96 kJ/mol and diﬀerent
initial vibrational excitations for the orientation with three hydrogens pointing
towards the surface. Since this is a repulsive term with a exponential fall-oﬀ
changes in the repulsion indicate the motion of the part of the wave packet
closest to the surface. At the beginning of the simulation the curves are almost
linear in a logarithmic plot, because the repulsion hardly changes the velocity
of the molecule. After some time the molecule enters into a region with a
higher surface repulsion and the slopes of the curves drop. This results in
a maximum at the turn-around point, where most of the initial translational
kinetic energy is transferred into potential energy of the surface repulsion. For
a classical simulation it would have meant no translational kinetic energy, but
it corresponds with the minimum kinetic energy for our wave packet simu-
lations. Past the maximum, a part of the wave packet will accelerate away
from the surface, and the slope becomes negative. The expectation value of
the translational kinetic energy (see Fig.6.1) increases at the same time. The
slope of the curves in Fig. 6.5 becomes less negative towards the end of the
simulation, although the expectation value of the translational kinetic energy

in this time region is almost constant. The reason for this is that a part of
the wave packet with less translational kinetic energy is still in a region close
to the surface. We see also that the height of the plateaus for the diﬀerent
initial vibrational excitations is again in the order; ν1 > ν3 > ν4 > ground
state. This again indicates that a larger part of the wave packet is inelastically
scattered when ν1 is excited than when ν3 is excited, etc.

At lower initial translational kinetic energies the plateaus have a lower po-
sition and the main gap exists between the plateaus of the ν1 and ν3 stretch
modes and the lower positioned plateaus of the ν4 umbrella mode and the
ground state. At an initial translational kinetic energy of 128 kJ/mol the
positions of the plateaus are higher and the diﬀerences between the initial
vibrational excitations are also smaller. The plateau of the ν3 stretch mode
is even around the same position as the ν4 umbrella mode for CD4 in the
orientation with three bonds pointing towards the surface at this initial en-
ergy. The orientation with two bonds pointing towards the surface shows the
same trends. The plateaus of the initial excited ν2 bending mode are located
slightly above the ground state for both isotopes. For the orientation with one
bond pointing towards the surface the relative positions of the plateaus of the
diﬀerent initial excitations are the same as at low energies in the orientation
with three bonds pointing towards the surface.

6.3. DISSOCIATION HYPOTHESES

81

6.3 Dissociation hypotheses

Even though we did not try to describe the dissociation itself, the scattering
simulation do yield indications for the role of vibrational excitations on the dis-
sociation of methane, and we compare these with experimental observations.
The dissociation of methane occurs over a late barrier, because it is enhanced
by vibrational energy [?]. Conventionally, the role of vibrational excitation
on the enhancement of dissociation probability was discussed as an eﬀect of
the availability of the extra (vibrational kinetic) energy for overcoming the
dissociation barrier. Our simulations show that such a process might play a
role, but they show also that two other processes occur through vibrational
excitation.

Firstly, an initial vibrational excitation increases translational kinetic en-
ergy transfer towards the intramolecular vibrational energy. The simulations
show that this inelastic scatter component can be seen in an large enhance-
ment of the vibrational kinetic energy in the stretch modes at the turn-around
point. This increase is larger for higher initial translational kinetic energy and
is most eﬀective in the orientation with three bonds pointing towards the sur-
face. If the dissociation of methane occurs primarily in this orientation, then
we would expect, based on the total available vibrational energy after hitting
the surface, that excitation of the ν1 symmetrical stretch mode is the most ef-
fective for enhancing the dissociation probability. The ν3 asymmetrical stretch
mode appears to be less so. An explanation of the enhanced inelastic scatter
compound by vibrational excitation is that through excitation the bonds are
weakened, which will ease excitation in the initial non-excited modes. Excita-
tions other than the ν2, ν3, or ν4 with a1 symmetry for a particular orientation
can possibly result in higher energy transfers, but we think that the diﬀerence
with ν1 (which has always a1 symmetry) would be still large.

Second, the accessibility of the dissociation channel also enhances the dis-
sociation probability. We have concluded in Chapter 4 (and Ref. [?]) that
our potential mimics reasonably the entrance channel for dissociation. In this
chapter we ﬁnd that a part of the wave packet has a longer residence time at
the surface. It is this part of the wave packet that accesses the dissociation
channel, and it is also this part that is able to come close to the transition state
for dissociation. From Figs. 6.1 and 6.5 we conclude that the ν1 stretch mode
will enhance the dissociation probability the most. The enhanced accessibility
by vibrational excitation is explained by the spread of the wave packet along
a C–H bond, which gives a higher probability for the system to be atop the
dissociation barrier.

The molecular beam experiment with excitations of the ν3 asymmetrical

82

CHAPTER 6. THE ROLE OF VIBRATIONAL EXCITATIONS

stretch mode of CH4 of Ref. [?] shows that a single excitation of the ν3 asym-
metrical stretch mode enhances dissociation, but the measured reactivity of
the ν3 stretch mode is too low to account for the total vibrational activation
observed in the molecular beam study of Ref. [?]. It means that excitation
of a mode other than the ν3 stretch mode will be more eﬀective for dissoci-
ation. Our simulations show that indeed excitation of the ν3 stretch mode
will enhance dissociation, but predict that excitation of the ν1 symmetrical
stretch mode will be more eﬀective if the dissociation occurs primary in the
orientation with multiple bonds pointing towards the surface. The contribu-
tion of the ν1 symmetrical stretch mode cannot be measured directly, because
it has no infra-red activity. However, the contribution of the ν1 mode can be
estimated using a molecular beam study as follows. The contribution of the
ν3 stretch mode has already been determined [?]. Similarly the contribution
of the ν4 umbrella mode can be determined. The contribution of the ν2 bend-
ing can be estimated from our simulations to be somewhat lower than the
ν4 umbrella contribution. The total contribution of all vibrations is known
from Ref. [?], and a simple subtraction will give us then the contribution of
the ν1 stretch mode. At high translational energies the accessibility of the
dissociation channel for molecules with an excited ν4 umbrella mode is close
to that of the molecules with excited stretch modes, and for CD4 the inelastic
scattering is also enhanced. So the excitation of the ν4 umbrella mode can
still contribute signiﬁcantly to the vibrational activation, because it also has
higher Boltzmann population in the molecular beam than the stretch modes.

6.4 Conclusions

We have performed wavepacket simulation of the scattering of ﬁxed oriented,
vibrationally excited CH4 and CD4 from a ﬂat surface. We used initial transla-
tional energies in the range of 32 to 128 kJ/mol. A single vibrational excitation
was put in one of the vibrational modes with a1 symmetry in the symmetry
group of the molecule plus surface, while the other vibrational modes were
kept in the groundstate. The potential-energy surface is characterised by an
elongation of the C–H bonds when the molecule approaches the surfaces, and
a molecule-surface part appropriate for Ni(111).

We ﬁnd that initial vibrational excitations enhance the transfer of transla-
tional energy towards vibrational energy and increase the accessibility of the
entrance channel for dissociation, which means an increase of inelastic scat-
tering. The largest eﬀects are observed in the orientation with three bonds
pointing to the surface. Our simulations predict that initial vibrational excita-

Classical trajectory
simulations

We present classical trajectory calculations of the rotational vibra-
tional scattering of a non-rigid methane molecule from a Ni(111)
surface. Energy dissipation and scattering angles have been stud-
ied as a function of the translational kinetic energy, the incidence
angle, the (rotational) nozzle temperature, and the surface temper-
ature. Scattering angles are somewhat towards the surface for the
incidence angles of 30◦, 45◦, and 60◦ at a translational energy of
96 kJ/mol. Energy loss is primarily from the normal component of
the translational energy. It is transfered for somewhat more than
half to the surface and the rest is transfered mostly to rotational
motion. The spread in the change of translational energy has a
basis in the spread of the transfer to rotational energy, and can be
enhanced by raising of the surface temperature through the transfer
process to the surface motion.∗

all internal vibrations. Instead we simulated the scattering of methane in ﬁxed
orientations, for which all internal vibrations can be included, and used the re-
sults to deduce consequences for the dissociation. These simulations indicate
that to dissociate methane the interaction of the molecule with the surface
should lead to an elongated equilibrium C–H bond length close to the surface,
and that the scattering was almost elastic. In Chapter 6 we reported on wave
packet simulations of the role of vibrational excitations for the scattering of
CH4 and CD4 (see also Ref. [?]). We predicted that initial vibrational excita-
tions of the asymmetrical stretch (ν3) but especially the symmetrical stretch
(ν1) modes will give the highest enhancement of the dissociation probability of
methane. Although we have performed these wave packet simulations in ten
dimensions, we still had to neglect two translational and three rotational co-
ordinates of the methane molecule and we did not account for surface motion
and corrugation. It is nowadays still hard to include all these features into
a wave packet simulation, therefore we decided to study these with classical
trajectory simulations.

In this chapter we will present full classical trajectory simulations of
methane from a Ni(111) surface. We have especially interest in the eﬀect
of the molecular rotations and surface motion, which we study as a function
of the nozzle and surface temperature. The methane molecule is ﬂexible and
able to vibrate. We do not include vibrational kinetic energy at the beginning
of the simulation, because a study of vibrational excitation due to the nozzle
temperature needs a special semi-classical treatment. Besides its relevance
for the dissociation reaction of methane on transition metals, our scattering
simulation can also be of interest as a reference model for the interpretation of
methane scattering itself, which have been studied with molecular beams on
Ag(111) [?, ?], Pt(111) [?, ?, ?, ?], and Cu(111) surfaces [?]. It was reported in
Refs. [?,?] that the scattering angles are in some cases in disagreement with the
outcome of the classical Hard Cube Model (HCM) described in Ref. [?]. We
will show in this article that the assumptions of this HCM model are too crude
for describing the processes obtained from our simulation. The time-of-ﬂight
experiments show that there is almost no vibrational excitation during the
scattering [?, ?], which is in agreement with our current classical simulations
and our wave packet simulations discussed in the previous Chapters 4 and 5.

The rest of this chapter is organized as follows. We start with a description
of our model potential, and an explanation of the simulation conditions. The
results and discussion are presented next. We start with the scattering angles,

and relate them to the energy dissipation processes. Next we will compare
our simulation with other experiments and theoretical models. We end with
a summary and some general conclusions.

7.2 Computational details

We have used classical molecular dynamics for simulating the scattering of
methane from a Ni(111) surface. The methane molecule was modelled as
a ﬂexible molecule. The forces on the carbon, hydrogen, and Ni atoms are
given by the gradient of the model potential energy surface described below.
The ﬁrst-order ordinary diﬀerential equations for the Newtonian equations
of motion of the Cartesian coordinates were solved with use of a variable-
order, variable-step Adams method [?]. We have simulated at translational
energies of 24, 48, 72, and 96 kJ/mol at normal incidence, and at 96 kJ/mol
for incidence angles of 30◦, 45◦, and 60◦ with the surface normal. The surface
temperature and (rotational) nozzle temperature for a certain simulation were
taken independently between 200 and 800 K.

7.2.1 Potential energy surface

The model potential energy surface used for the classical dynamics is derived
from one of our model potentials with elongated C–H bond lengths towards the
surface, previously used for wave packet simulation of the vibrational scatter-
ing of ﬁxed oriented methane on a ﬂat surface [see Eq. 3.22 in Section 3.3, and
also Refs. [?] and [?]]. In this original potential there is one part responsible for
the repulsive interaction between the surface and the hydrogens, and another
part for the intramolecular interaction between carbon and hydrogens.

We have rewritten the repulsive part [see Eq. 3.13] in pair potential terms
between top layer surface Ni atoms and hydrogens in such a way that the
surface integral over all these Ni atoms give the same overall exponential fall-
oﬀ as the original repulsive PES term for a methane molecule far away from
the surface in an orientation with three bonds pointing towards the surface.
The repulsive pair interaction term Vrep between hydrogen i and Ni atom j at
the surface is then given by

Vrep =

A e−αZij

(7.1)

where Zij is the distance between hydrogen atom i and Ni atom j.

CHAPTER 7. CLASSICAL TRAJECTORY SIMULATIONS

The intramolecular potential part is split up in bond, bond angle, and
cross potential energy terms. The single C–H bond energy is given by a Morse
function with bond lengthening towards the surface

where De is the dissociation energy of methane in the gas phase, and Ri is
the length of the C–H bond i. Dissociation is not possible at the surface with
this potential term, but the entrance channel for dissociation is mimicked by
an elongation of the equilibrium bond length Req when the distance between
the hydrogen atom and the Ni atoms in the top layer of the surface become
shorter. This is achieved by

Req = R0 + S

e−αZij

where R0 is the equilibrium C–H bond length in the gas phase. The bond
elongation factor S was chosen in such a way that the elongation is 0.054 nm
at the classical turning point of 93.2 kJ/mol incidence translational energy for
a rigid methane molecule, when the molecule approach a surface Ni atom atop
with one bond pointing towards the surface. The single angle energy is given
by the harmonic expression

Vangle = kθ (θij −

θ0)2,

where θij is the angle between C–H bond i and j, and θ0 the equilibrium bond
angle. Furthermore, there are some cross-term potentials between bonds and
angles. The interaction between two bonds are given by

The interaction between a bond angle and the bond angle on the other side is
given by

by ﬁtting the second derivatives of these terms on the experimental vibrational
frequencies of CH4 and CD4 in the gas phase [?, ?].

7.2.2 Simulation model

The surface is modelled by a slab consisting of four layers of eight times eight
Ni atoms. Periodic boundary conditions have been used in the lateral direction
for the Ni-Ni interactions. The methane molecule has interactions with the
sixty-four Ni atoms in the top layer of the slab. The surface temperature is set
according to the following procedure. The Ni atoms are placed in equilibrium
positions and are given random velocities out of a Maxwell-Boltzmann distri-
bution with twice the surface temperature. The velocities are corrected such

90

CHAPTER 7. CLASSICAL TRAJECTORY SIMULATIONS

that the total momentum of all surface atoms is zero in all directions, which
ﬁxes the surface in space. Next the surface is allowed to relax for 350 fs. We
do the following ten times iteratively. If at the end of previous relaxation the
total kinetic energy is above or below the given surface temperature, then all
velocities are scaled down or up with a factor of √1.1 respectively. Afterwards
a new relaxation simulation is performed. The end of each relaxation run is
used as the begin condition of the surface for the actual scattering simulation.
The initial perpendicular carbon position was chosen 180 nm above the
equilibrium z-position of the top layer atoms and was given randomly paral-
lel (x, y) positions within the central surface unit cell of the simulation slab
for the normal incidence simulations. The methane was placed in a random
orientation with the bonds and angles of the methane in the minimum of the
gas phase potential. The initial rotational angular momentum was generated
randomly from a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution for the given nozzle temper-
ature for all three rotation axis separately. No vibrational kinetic energy was
given initially. Initial translational velocity was given to all methane atoms
according to the translational energy. The simulations under an angle were
given parallel momentum in the [110] direction. The parallel positions have
been translated according to the parallel velocities in such a way that the ﬁrst
collision occurs one unit cell before the central unit cell of the simulation box.
We tested other directions, but did not see any diﬀerences for the scattering.
Each scattering simulation consisted of 2500 trajectories with a simulation
time of 1500 fs each. We calculated the (change of) translational, total kinetic,
rotational and vibrational kinetic, intramolecular potential, and total energy of
the methane molecule; and the scattering angles at the end of each trajectory.
We calculated for them the averages and standard deviations, which gives the
spread for the set of trajectories, and correlations coeﬃcients from which we
can abstract information about the energy transfer processes.

7.3 Results and discussion

We will now present and discuss the results of our simulations. We begin
with the scattering angle distribution. Next we will explain this in terms
of the energy dissipation processes. Finally we will compare our simulation
with previous theoretical and experimental scattering studies, and discuss the
possible eﬀects on the dissociation of methane on transition metal surfaces.

7.3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

91

7.3.1 Scattering angles

Figure 7.1 shows the scattering angle distribution for diﬀerent incidence angles
with a initial total translational energy of 96 kJ/mol at nozzle and surface tem-
peratures of both 200 and 800 K. The scatter angle is calculated from the ratio
between the normal and the total parallel momentum of the whole methane
molecule. We observe that most of the trajectories scatter some degrees to-
wards the surface from the specular. This means that there is relatively more
parallel momentum than normal momentum at the end of the simulation com-
pared with the initial ratio. This ratio change is almost completely caused by
a decrease of normal momentum.

The higher nozzle and surface temperatures have almost no inﬂuence on
the peak position of the distribution, but give a broader distribution. The
standard deviation in the scattering angle distribution goes up from 2.7◦, 2.4◦,
and 2.2◦ at 200K to 4.4◦, 3.8◦, and 3.4◦ at 800K for incidence angles of 30◦,
45◦, and 60◦ respectively. This means that the angular width is very narrow,
because the full width at half maximum (FWHM) are usually larger than
20◦. [?] (The FWHM is approximately somewhat more than twice the standard
deviation.) The broadening is caused almost completely by raising the surface
temperature, and has again primarily an eﬀect on the spread of the normal
momentum of the molecule. This indicates that the scattering of methane
from Ni(111) is dominated by a thermal roughening process.

We do not observe an average out-of-plane diﬀraction for the non normal
incidence simulations, but we do see some small out-of-plane broadening. The
standard deviations in the out-of-plane angle were 0.9◦, 1.8◦, 3.4◦ at a surface
temperature of 200K, and 1.7◦, 3.3◦, and 6.0◦ at 800K for incidence angles
of 30◦, 45◦, and 60◦ with the surface normal. Raising the (rotational) nozzle
temperature has hardly any eﬀect on the out-of-plane broadening.

7.3.2 Energy dissipation processes

Translational energy

Figure 7.2 shows the average energy change of some energy components of
the methane molecule between the end and the begin of the trajectories as a
function of the initial total translational energy. The incoming angle for all is
0◦ (normal incidence), and both the nozzle and surface are initially 400K. If
we plot the normal incidence translational energy component of the simulation
at 96 kJ/mol for the diﬀerent incidence angles, then we see a similar relation.
This means that there is normal translational energy scaling for the scattering
process in general, except for some small diﬀerences discussed later on.

94

CHAPTER 7. CLASSICAL TRAJECTORY SIMULATIONS

Most of the initial energy of methane is available as translational energy,
so it cannot be surprising that we see here the highest energy loss. The trans-
lational energy loss takes a higher percentage of the initial translational energy
at higher initial translational energies. Since almost all of the momentum loss
is in the normal direction, we also see that the loss of translational energy can
be found back in the normal component of the translational energy for the
non-normal incidence simulations.

The average change of the total energy of the methane molecule is less neg-
ative than the average change in translational energy, which means that there
is a net transfer of the initial methane energy towards the surface during the
scattering. This is somewhat more than half of the loss of translational energy.
The percentage of transfered energy to the surface related to the normal inci-
dence translational energy is also enhanced at higher incidence energies. There
is somewhat more translational energy loss, and energy transfer towards the
surface for the larger scattering angles, than occurs at the comparable normal
translational energy at normal incidence. This is caused probably by inter-
actions with more surface atoms, when the molecule scatters under an larger
angle with the surface normal.

In Fig. 7.2 we also plotted the average change of methane potential energy
and the change of rotational and vibrational kinetic energy of methane. We
observe that there is extremely little energy transfer towards the potential
energy, and a lot of energy transfer towards rotational and vibrational kinetic
energy. Vibrational motion gives an increase of both potential and kinetic
energy. Rotational motion gives only an increase in kinetic energy. So this
means that there is almost no vibrational inelastic scattering, and very much
rotational inelastic scattering.

Figure 7.3 shows the standard deviations in the energy change of some en-
ergy components of methane versus the initial translational energy at normal
incidence for a nozzle and surface temperature of 200K. (The temperature ef-
fects will be discussed below.) The standard deviations in the energy changes
are quite large compared to the average values. The standard deviations in
the change of the methane translational energy and in the change of methane
rotational and vibrational kinetic energy increase more than the standard de-
viation in the change of methane total energy, when the initial translational
energy is increased. We ﬁnd again an identical relation if we plot the stan-
dard deviations versus the initial normal energy component of the scattering
at diﬀerent incidence angles. The standard deviations are much smaller in the
parallel than in the normal component of the translational energy, so again
only the normal component of the translational energy is important. Although

the standard deviations in the translational energy is smaller at larger inci-
dence angles than at smaller incidence angles, we see in Fig. 7.1 that the
spread in the angle distribution is almost the same. This is caused by the fact
that at large angles deviations in the normal direction has more eﬀect on the
deviation in the angle than at smaller angles with the normal.

Surface temperature

An increase of surface temperature gives a small reduction of average trans-
lational energy loss (around 5 % from 200K to 800K at 96 kJ/mol normal
incidence). This is the reason why we do not observe a large shift of the peak
position of the scattering angle distribution. However, an increase of surface
temperature does have a larger eﬀect on the average energy transfer to the
surface, but this is in part compensated through a decrease of energy transfer
to rotational energy.

Figure 7.4 shows the standard deviations in the energy change of the trans-
lational energy, the methane total energy, and the methane rotational and vi-
brational kinetic energy as a function of the surface temperature. We observe
that the standard deviation in the change of rotational and vibrational kinetic

energy hardly changes at increasing surface temperature. At a low surface
temperature it is much higher than the standard deviation in the change of
the methane total energy. So the baseline broadening of translational energy
is caused by the transfer of translational to rotational motion. The stan-
dard deviation in the change of the methane total energy increases much at
higher surface temperature. This results also in an increase of the standard
deviation in the change of translational energy, which means that the surface
temperature inﬂuences the energy transfer process between translational and
surface motion. The spread in the change of translational energy is related to
the spread in the scattering angle distributions. It is now clear that the ob-
served broadening of the scattering angle distribution with increasing surface
temperature is really caused by a thermal roughening process.

Nozzle temperature

Figure 7.5 shows the dependency of the standard deviations for the diﬀerent
energy changes on the nozzle temperature. From this ﬁgure it is clear that the
nozzle temperature has relative little inﬂuence on the standard deviations in
the diﬀerent energy changes. Therefore we observe almost no peak broadening

in the scattering angle distribution due to the nozzle temperature. The nozzle
temperature has also no inﬂuence on the average change of rotational and
vibrational kinetic energy, which means that this part of the energy transfer
process is driven primarily by normal incidence translational energy.

We have to keep in mind that we only studied the rotational heating by
the nozzle temperature, and that we did not take vibrational excitation by
nozzle heating into account. From our wave packet simulations in Chapter 5
we know that vibrational excitations can contribute to a strong enhancement
of vibrational inelastic scattering (see also Ref. [?]). So the actual eﬀect of
raising the nozzle temperature can be diﬀerent than sketched here.

7.3.3 Comparison with other studies

Scattering angles and the Hard Cube Model

The angular dependence of scattered intensity for a ﬁxed total scattering angle
has only been measured at Pt(111) [?,?]. The measurement has been compared
with the predictions of the Hard Cube Model (HCM) as described in Ref. [?].
There seems to be more or less agreement for low translational energies under

98

CHAPTER 7. CLASSICAL TRAJECTORY SIMULATIONS

an angle around 45◦ with the surface, but is anomalous at a translational
energy of 55 kJ/mol. The anomalous behaviour has been explained by altering
the inelastic collision dynamics through intermediate methyl fragments.

Although our simulations are for Ni(111) instead of Pt(111) and we calcu-
late real angular distributions, we will show now that the HCM is insuﬃcient
for describing the processes involved with the scattering of methane in our
simulation. The HCM neglects the energy transfer to rotational excitations,
and overestimates the energy transfer to the surface. This is not surprising,
because the HCM is constructed as a simple classical model for the scattering
of gas atoms from a solid surface. The basic assumptions are that (1) the
interaction of the gas atom with a surface atom is represented by an impul-
sive force of repulsion, (2) the gas-surface intermolecular potential is uniform
in the plane of the surface, (3) the surface is represented by a set of inde-
pendent particles conﬁned by square well potentials, (4) the surface particles
have a Maxwellian velocity distribution [?]. Assumption 1 excludes inelastic
rotational scattering, because the gas particle is an atom without moment of
inertia. So the HCM misses a large part of inelastic scattering. However,
it still predicts scattering angles much more below the incidence angles than
we found from our simulation. For example: The HCM predicts an average
scattering angle with the surface normal of 64◦ from Ni(111), at an incidence
angle of 45◦ at a surface temperature four times lower than the gas temper-
ature. This is much more than for Pt(111), because the mass ratio between
the gas particle and the surface atom is higher for Ni(111). There are several
explanations for this error. First, the assumption 3 is unreasonable for atomic
surfaces with low atom weight, because the surface atoms are strongly bound
to each other. This means that eﬀectively the surface has a higher mass than
assumed [?]. Second, there is no one-on-one interaction between surface atom
and methane molecule, but multiple hydrogen atoms interacting with diﬀerent
Ni atoms. Third, the methane molecule is not rigid in contrast to assumption
1. We have followed the energy distribution during the simulation for some
trajectories and ﬁnd that the methane molecule adsorbs initial rotational and
translational energy as vibrational energy in its bonds and bond angles when
close the surface, which is returned after the methane moves away from it.

It would be nice to test our model with molecular beam experiment of the
scattering angles on surfaces with relatively low atom weight, which also try
to look at rotational inelastic scattering.

7.3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

99

Wave packet simulations

Let us now compare the full classical dynamics with our ﬁxed oriented wave
packet simulations as discussed in the previous chapters (see also Refs. [?,
?, ?]), because this was initial the reason to perform the classical dynamics
simulations. Again we observe very little vibrational inelastic scattering. This
is in agreement with the observations in the time-of-ﬂight experiments on
Pt(111) [?, ?].

Since we used our wave packet simulations to deduce consequences for the
dissociation of methane, we have to wonder whether the observed inelastic
scattering in our classical simulations changes the picture of the dissociation
in our previous publications. Therefore we have to look at what happens at
the surface. We did so by following some trajectories in time.

We ﬁnd approximately the same energy rearrangements for the classical
simulations as discussed for the wave packet simulations for the vibrational
groundstate in Chapters 4 and 5 (see also Refs. [?] and [?]). Again most of
the normal translational energy is transfered to the potential energy terms of
the surface repulsion [see Eq. 7.1]. This repulsive potential energy was only
given back to translational energy in the wave packet simulations, because
the orientations and surface were ﬁxed. For the classical trajectory simula-
tions presented in this article, the repulsive potential energy is transfered to
translational, rotational, and surface energy through the inherent force of the
repulsive energy terms. We observe almost no energy transfers to translational
energy parallel to the surface, so exclusion of these translational coordinates
in the wave packet simulations do not eﬀect our deduction on the dissociation.
The energy transfers to the rotational and surface energy during the collision
make it harder for the molecule to approach the surface. This will have a
quantitative eﬀect on the eﬀective bond lengthening near the surface, but not
a qualitative.

The remaining problem deals with the eﬀect of rotational motion on the
dissociation probability and steering. Our ﬁrst intension was to look for the
favourable orientation at the surface, but from following some trajectories it is
clear that steering does not seem to occur. There is always some rotational mo-
tion, and the molecule leaves the surface often with another hydrogen pointing
towards to surface than when it approaches the surface. This indicates that
multiple bonds have a chance to dissociate during one collision. However, it
will be very speculative to draw more conclusion on the dissociation of methane
based on the scattering in these classical trajectory simulations. Classical tra-
jectory simulation with an extension of our potentials with an exit channel for
dissociation can possibly learn us more.

CHAPTER 7. CLASSICAL TRAJECTORY SIMULATIONS

7.4 Conclusions

We have performed classical dynamics simulations of the rotational vibrational
scattering of non-rigid methane from a corrugated Ni(111) surface. Energy dis-
sipation and scattering angles have been studied as a function of the transla-
tional kinetic energy, the incidence angle, the (rotational) nozzle temperature,
and the surface temperature.

We ﬁnd the peak of the scattering angle distribution somewhat below the
incidence angle of 30◦, 45◦, and 60◦ at a translational energy of 96 kJ/mol.
This is caused by an average energy loss in the normal component of the
translational energy. An increase of initial normal translational energy gives an
enhancement of inelastic scattering. The energy loss is transfered for somewhat
more than half to the surface and the rest mostly to rotational motion. The
vibrational scattering is almost completely elastic.

The broadening of the scattering angle distribution is mainly caused by the
energy transfer process of translational energy to rotational energy. Heating
of the nozzle temperature gives no peak broadening. Heating of the surface
temperature gives an extra peak broadening through thermal roughening of
the surface.

The Hard Cube Model seems to be insuﬃcient for describing the scatter-
ing angles of methane from Ni(111), if we compare its assumptions with the
processes found in our simulations.

CHAPTER 7. CLASSICAL TRAJECTORY SIMULATIONS

Chapter 8

Concluding remarks

I will give an overview and brief discussion of the research described
in this thesis, and make some suggestion for further research.

8.1

Introduction

This thesis is mainly a research article collection.
I have tried to keep the
contains of the separate articles as close as possible to the originals, when it
deals with the results and discussion sections and put the overlap between
some articles, dealing with methods and potentials, in a separate chapter. By
doing so, I have left the research within the history of time. Over the years our
thoughts have been changed by new experimental and theoretical studies. I
will give therefore now a point by point overview of the phenomena discussed
within diﬀerent chapters, and give some suggestions for further research on
the dissociation of methane on transition metal surfaces based on our ﬁndings
and recent new developments.

8.2 Scattering

We have performed scattering simulation of methane scattering on a Ni(111)
surface with wave packet and classical trajectory dynamics.

We have been using the multiconﬁgurational time-dependent Hartree
(MCTDH) method for our wave packet simulation, because it can deal with
a large number of degrees of freedom and with large grids. We used four dif-
ferent PESs for ﬁxed molecular orientations with one, two, and three bonds
pointing towards the surface, which are described in Chapter 3. (A harmonic

103

104

CHAPTER 8. CONCLUDING REMARKS

intramolecular PES is adapted to include anharmonicities in the C–H/D dis-
tance, the decrease of C–H/D bond energy due to interactions with the ﬂat
surface, and the increase of C–H/D bond length also due to interactions with
the ﬂat surface.) We used in Chapters 4 and 5 a translational energy of up to
96 kJ/mol normal incidence and all internal vibrations in the ground state. We
did not include parallel translational and rotational coordinates in our model.
The scattering was in all cases predominantly elastic. However, the observed
inelastic scattering of CD4 compared with simulation on CH4 is higher for
the PES with an elongated equilibrium bond length close to the surface. Our
wave packet simulations in Chapter 6 showed that vibrational excitation of a
single mode enhanced inelastic scattering with transfer of translational energy
to vibrational energy, especially for the stretch modes in the orientation with
three bonds pointing towards the surface.

We have performed classical dynamics simulations of the rotational vi-
brational scattering of non-rigid methane from a corrugated Ni(111) surface,
which is described in Chapter 7. Energy dissipation and scattering angles have
been studied as a function of the translational kinetic energy, the incidence
angle, the (rotational) nozzle temperature, and the surface temperature. We
ﬁnd the peak of the scattering angle distribution somewhat towards the sur-
face for the incidence angle of 30◦, 45◦, and 60◦ at a translational energy of
96 kJ/mol. This is caused by an average energy loss in the normal component
of the translational energy. An increase of initial normal translational energy
gives an enhancement of inelastic scattering. The energy loss is transfered
for somewhat more than half to the surface and the rest mostly to rotational
motion. The vibrational scattering is almost completely elastic, which is in
agreement with the wave packet simulations in the vibrational ground state.
The broadening of the scattering angle distribution is mainly caused by the
energy transfer process of translational energy to rotational energy. Heating
of the nozzle temperature gives no peak broadening. Heating of the surface
temperature gives an extra peak broadening through thermal roughening of
the surface.

8.3 Dissociation

The dissociative adsorption of methane on transition metals is an important
reaction in catalysis; it is the rate limiting step in steam reforming to produce
syngas, and it is prototypical for catalytic C–H activation. Therefore the disso-
ciation is of high interest for many surface scientists. I gave an overview of the
experimental and theoretical studies upon methane dissociation on transition-

8.3. DISSOCIATION

105

metal surfaces in Chapter 2. Molecular beam experiments in which the dis-
sociation probability was measured as a function of translational energy have
observed that the dissociation probability is enhanced by the normal incidence
component of the incidence translational energy. This suggests that the re-
action occurs primarily through a direct dissociation mechanism at least for
high translational kinetic energies. Some experiments have also observed that
vibrationally hot CH4 dissociates more readily than cold CH4, with the energy
in the internal vibrations being about as eﬀective as the translational energy
in inducing dissociation. A molecular beam experiment with laser excitation
of the ν3 mode did succeed in measuring a strong enhancement of the disso-
ciation on a Ni(100) surface. However, this enhancement was still much too
low to account for the vibrational activation observed in previous studies and
indicated that other vibrationally excited modes contribute signiﬁcantly to the
reactivity of thermal samples.

It is very interesting to simulate the dynamics of the dissociation, because
of the direct dissociation mechanism, and the role of the internal vibrations.
Wave packet simulations of the methane dissociation reaction on transition
metals have treated the methane molecule always as a diatomic up to now.
Apart from one C–H bond (a pseudo ν3 stretch mode) and the molecule sur-
face distance, either (multiple) rotations or some lattice motion were included.
None of these studies have looked at the role of the other internal vibrations,
so there is no model that describes which vibrationally excited mode might be
responsible for the experimental observed vibrational activation. We were not
able yet to simulate the dissociation including all internal vibrations with wave
packet dynamics. Instead we have deduced from our scattering simulations
consequences for the dissociation. We did so by looking at vibrational exci-
tation, the structure deformation, and the energy distribution of the methane
molecule, when it hits the surface.

8.3.1 Reaction mechanism and paths

When the molecule hits the surface, we always observe vibrational excitations
of the ν4 umbrella and ν2 bending modes for the CH4 molecule in Chapter 4,
especially in the orientations with two or three hydrogens pointing towards the
surface. This is due to a favorable coupling that originates from the repulsive
interaction with the surface, and the low excitation energies. Deformations of
the molecule are predominantly in the bond angles. The changes in the bond
angles are, however, too small to allow for the formation of a Ni–C bond, as
suggested in the “splats” model of methane dissociation [?].

Appreciable excitations of the ν1 and ν3 stretch modes when methane hits

106

CHAPTER 8. CONCLUDING REMARKS

the surface are only observed when one hydrogen atom points towards the
surface, or when the intramolecular PES has an elongated equilibrium C–
H bond length close to the surface. The repulsion of the surface shortens
the C–H bond. This can only be overcome when the intramolecular PES
incorporates the eﬀect of a longer equilibrium C–H bond length caused by
overlap of occupied surface orbitals with the antibonding orbitals of methane.
This agrees with quantum chemical calculations, which show a late barrier for
dissociation.

8.3.2 The isotope eﬀect

A nice way to study reaction dynamics is the use of isotopes. The most
recent wave packet simulation on the dissociation probability of CH4 and CD4
showed a semiquantitative agreement with the molecular beam experiments of
Ref. [?], except for the isotope eﬀect and the extracted vibrational eﬃcacy [?].
Therefore we started a study on the scattering of CD4, which is described in
Chapter 5.

When the molecule hits the surface, we observed in general a higher vibra-
tional excitation for CD4 than CH4. The PES with an elongated equilibrium
bond length close to the surface gives for both isotopes almost the same defor-
mations, although we observe a somewhat smaller bond lengthening for CD4
in the orientation with three bonds pointing towards the surface. The other
model PESs show diﬀerences in the bond angle deformations and in the distri-
bution of the excitation probabilities of CD4 and CH4, especially for the PES
with only an anharmonic intramolecular potential.

Energy distribution analysis proofs observations and hypotheses obtained
from excitation probabilities and structure deformation, and contributes new
information on the scattering dynamics. A high increase of vibrational kinetic
energy results in higher inelastic scattering. The highest increase of vibrational
kinetic energy is found in the ν3 asymmetrical stretch modes for all orientations
and in the ν1 symmetrical stretch mode for the orientation with three bonds
pointing towards the surface, when the PES has an elongated equilibrium bond
length close to the surface.

8.3.3 The role of vibrational excitation

In Chapter 6 we discuss the eﬀect of vibrational excitation on the dissociation.
We used initial translational energies in the range of 32 to 128 kJ/mol. A
single vibrational excitation was put in one of the vibrational modes with
a1 symmetry in the symmetry group of the molecule plus surface, while the

8.4. FURTHER RESEARCH

107

other vibrational modes were kept in the ground state. The potential-energy
surface is characterised by an elongation of the C–H bonds when the molecule
approaches the surfaces, and a molecule-surface part appropriate for Ni(111).
We ﬁnd that initial vibrational excitations enhance the transfer of translational
energy towards vibrational energy and increase the accessibility of the entrance
channel for dissociation, which means an increase of inelastic scattering. The
largest eﬀects are observed in the orientation with three bonds pointing to
the surface. Our simulations predict that initial vibrational excitations of the
asymmetrical stretch (ν3) and especially the symmetrical stretch (ν1) modes
will give the highest enhancement of the dissociation probability of methane.
A recent four-dimensional wave packet simulations of the O(3P) + CH4 →
OH + CH3 reaction, also ﬁnds also that the symmetric stretch vibration of CH4
is more eﬃcient in promoting the reaction than the asymmetric stretch [?]. It
shows also that models that only consider a local C–H stretching of CH4 are
not appropriate to make comparisons in which the asymmetric stretch mode
is selectively excited.

8.4 Further research

The simulations with our diﬀerent model PESs show that the internal vi-
brations play an important role in the dissociation mechanism. Excitation
probabilities when the molecule hits the surface show how the translational
energy is converted into vibrational energy and it is distributed over the in-
ternal modes. These probabilities vary strongly with the PES. As only few
internal vibrations contribute to the dissociation, it is important to obtain
more information on the real PES for this system. One way of obtaining an
more accurate potential is by doing electronic structure calculations. Since we
have to deal with the interaction with a metallic surface, only DFT calcula-
tion seem to be a reasonable option. It will be still very hard to calculate a
full 15 dimensional potential. Therefore a reduced dimensional PES should be
constructed.

Our wave packet simulations give an indications that the isotope eﬀect in
the methane dissociation is caused mostly by the diﬀerence in the scattering
behaviour of the molecule in the orientation with three bonds pointing towards
the surface. At least multiple vibrational stretch modes should be included for
a reasonable description of isotope eﬀect in the methane dissociation reaction.
Also our wave packet simulations of vibrational excited methane suggests that
both the asymmetrical stretch (ν3) and the symmetrical stretch (ν1) modes
should be included. Our classical trajectory simulations shows that parallel

108

CHAPTER 8. CONCLUDING REMARKS

translational is relatively unimportant, and that rotational energy plays an
important role for at least the scattering channel.
It also shows that it is
possible that multiple bonds interact with the surface.

Very important for our understanding of the methane dissociation on tran-
sition metal surfaces will be the progress made by molecular beam experiments
with state selective excitations with lasers. It can be interesting if this tech-
nique is combined with the use of diﬀerent isotopomers of methane. This will
give us also an idea, which reduced dimensional models for our simulations
should be tried.
I think especially the CHD3 molecule will be a good iso-
topomer to study further, because we can approximate that the dissociation
occurs only along the C–H bond in our dynamics simulations while we include
multiple vibrational stretch modes.

Summary

The dissociation of methane on transition metals is an important reaction in
catalysis. It is the rate limiting step in steam reforming to produce syngas.
Molecular beam experiments have shown that the energy in the internal vibra-
tions are about as eﬀective as the translational energy in inducing dissociation.
The published wave packet simulations on the methane dissociation re-
action on transition metals have treated the methane molecule always as a
diatomic up to now. Besides the C–H bond and molecule surface distance, a
combination of other coordinates were included, like (multiple) rotations and
some lattice motion. None of them have looked at the role of the internal
vibrations. We were not able yet to simulate the dissociation including all
internal vibrations. Instead we simulated the scattering of methane in ﬁxed
orientations, for which all internal vibrations can be included, and used the
results to deduce consequences for the dissociation.

We have been using the multi-conﬁgurational time-dependent Hartree
(MCTDH) method for our wave packet simulation, because it can deal with
a large number of degrees of freedom and with large grids. We have started
with a study on diﬀerent model potential energy surfaces (PESs) that have
been developed with Ni(111) in mind. We found that the scattering of CH4
is almost completely elastic for all model PESs. Vibrational excitations when
the molecule hits the surface and the corresponding deformation show that for
methane to dissociate the interaction of the molecule with the surface should
lead to an elongated equilibrium C–H bond length close to the surface.

We studied the isotope eﬀects with CD4 in the same way, and found an
elastic scattering somewhat less than for CH4. Energy distribution analysis
at the surface of the expectation values of the kinetic energy operators and
terms potential energy terms gives enhanced insight in the scattering process.
Our simulations give an indications that the isotope eﬀect in the methane
dissociation is caused mostly by the diﬀerence in the scattering behaviour of
the molecule in the orientation with three bonds pointing towards the surface.
Next we looked at the role of single vibrational excitations at the diﬀerent

SUMMARY

orientations. A high increase of vibrational kinetic energy results in higher
inelastic scattering. The highest increase of vibrational kinetic energy and
of the accessibility of the entrance channel for dissociation are found for the
ν3 asymmetrical stretch mode, and especially for the ν1 symmetrical stretch
mode. This indicates that the ν1 will give the highest enhancement of the
dissociation probability.

We ended with classical trajectory calculations of the rotational vibrational
scattering of a non-rigid methane molecule from a Ni(111) surface. Energy
dissipation and scattering angles have been studied as a function of the trans-
lational kinetic energy, the incident angle, the (rotational) nozzle temperature,
and the surface temperature. Scattering angles are somewhat towards the sur-
face for the incidence angles of 30◦, 45◦, and 60◦ at a translational energy of
96 kJ/mol. Energy loss is primarily from the normal component of the trans-
lational energy and transfered for somewhat more than half to the surface and
the rest mostly to rotational motion.

Samenvatting

De dissociatie van methaan is een katalytisch interessante reactie. Het is de
snelheidsbepalende stap voor de vorming van synthese-gas. Experimenten met
moleculaire bundels op ´e´enkristallen van overgangsmetalen hebben aangetoond
dat het een directe dissociatie betreft, die zowel door translationele als door
vibrationele energie bevorderd wordt.

In het verleden heeft men geprobeerd de dynamica van de dissociatie te
simuleren met golfpakketmethoden door methaan te beschouwen als een twee-
atomig molecuul. Hoewel hiermee enkele tendensen beschreven kunnen wor-
den, kunnen met deze simulaties de rol van andere vibraties dan de asym-
metrische strekvibratie in de reactiedynamica niet bestudeerd worden. Het is
echter nog steeds lastig om de dissociatiereactie in hogere dimensies te beschri-
jven met behulp van golfpakketmethoden. In plaats daarvan is gekeken naar
de verstrooiing van methaan met een speciﬁeke ori¨entatie, waarbij wel alle
vibraties kunnen worden meegenomen, en hieruit informatie te winnen over
de dissocatiereactie.

Voor de golfpakket-simulaties is gebruik gemaakt van de multi-conﬁgu-
rational time-dependent Hartree (MCTDH) methode, omdat deze methode
zeer geschikt is voor systemen met een hoge dimensie en grote roosters. Be-
gonnen werd met de bestudering van verschillende modelpotentialen voor de
verstrooiing aan Ni(111). Hierbij werd als eerste gekeken naar de verstrooi-
ingswaarschijnlijkheden van CH4. Het bleek dat de verstrooiing bijna volledig
elastisch is voor de bestudeerde potentialen. Daarom is ook gekeken naar de
excitatiewaarschijnlijkheden en de verwachtingswaarden van de structuurde-
formaties bij het oppervlak. De potentiaal met een verlenging van de even-
wichtsbindingslengte bij het oppervlak bleek als enige geschikt om de ingang
van het reactiekanaal te beschrijven.

Om het isotoop-eﬀect te bestuderen is vervolgens weer gekeken naar de
excitaties en deformaties bij het oppervlak voor CD4. De verstrooiing was
weer bijna volledig elastisch, maar minder dan voor CH4. Om beter inzicht
te verkrijgen in de verschillen tussen de verstrooiings-processen van beide iso-

111

112

SAMENVATTING

topomeren werd ook de energiedistributie bij het oppervlak bestudeerd door
de verwachtingswaarden van de kinetische operatoren en de belangrijkste ter-
men van de potentiaal te berekenen. Het is gebleken dat bij een ori¨entatie met
drie bindingen gericht naar het oppervlak een groter isotoop-eﬀect mag worden
verwacht dan bij andere ori¨entaties. Dit verklaart ook waarom de simulaties
met een twee-atomig methaanmodel een kleiner isotoop-eﬀect geven dan ex-
perimenteel gevonden is.

Vervolgens is er gekeken naar het eﬀect van een enkelvoudige exci-
tatie van de verschillende vibrationele modes bij verschillende ori¨entaties.
Waargenomen werd dat de inelastische verstrooiing hierdoor toeneemt en meer
overdracht van translationele energie naar vibrationele energie plaatsvindt.
Ook blijkt het eenvoudiger te worden om het ingangskanaal van dissociatie
binnen te gaan. Beide eﬀecten zijn het grootst voor de ν3 asymmetrische en
vooral de ν1 symmetrische strekmodes in de ori¨entatie met drie bindingen naar
het oppervlak gericht. Excitatie van de ν1 symmetrische strekmode brengt
hierdoor waarschijnlijk een grotere toename van dissociatiewaarschijnlijkheid
teweeg dan de overige modes.

Afsluitend zijn er klassieke dynamica simulaties gedaan aan de verstrooiing
van methaan op een Ni(111) oppervlak, waarbij de dimensionaliteit van het
model kan worden verhoogd. Hierbij is gekeken naar de eﬀecten van trans-
lationele energie, de rotationele nozzle temperatuur, en de temperatuur van
het oppervlak voor het energie-overdrachtprocessen en de verstrooiingshoeken.
De verstrooiingshoeken zijn enkele graden gericht naar het oppervlak voor de
inkomende hoeken van 30◦, 45◦, en 60◦ bij een translationele energie van 96
kJ/mol. Energie-verlies is er voornamelijk in de normaal component van de
translationele energie en wordt overgedragen voor iets meer dan de helft aan
het oppervlak en voor de rest aan rotatiebeweging.

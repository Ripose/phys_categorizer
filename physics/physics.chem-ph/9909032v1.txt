Accurate quartic anharmonic force ﬁelds for CF4 and SiF4 have been calculated using
the CCSD(T) method and basis sets of spdf quality. Based on the ab initio force ﬁeld
with a minor empirical adjustment, the vibrational energy levels of these two molecules and
their isotopomers are calculated by means of high order Canonical Van Vleck Perturbation
Theory(CVPT) based on curvilinear coordinates. The calculated energies agree very well
with the experimental data. The full quadratic force ﬁeld of CF4 is further reﬁned to the
experimental data. The symmetrization of the Cartesian basis for any combination bands
of Td group molecules is discussed using the circular promotion operator for the doubly
degenerate modes, together with tabulated vector coupling coeﬃcients. The extraction of
the spectroscopic constants from our second order transformed Hamiltonian in curvilinear
coordinates is discussed, and compared to a similar procedure in rectilinear coordinates.

I. INTRODUCTION

Carbon tetraﬂuoride (also know as Freon-14) and tetraﬂuorosilane are molecules of wide ranging industrial,
environmental, and economical interest. While the use of carbon tetraﬂuoride is being phased out together
with that of other CFCs, it has a number of other important industrial and technological applications.1
These include use as an isolator and extinguisher gas in high-voltage applications, and as an etching gas
in the semiconductor industry.1 The formation of CF4. . . O2 adducts was considered as a model system for
the use of liquid perﬂuorochemicals in artiﬁcial blood.2 Tetraﬂuorosilane, SiF4, is a precursor (e.g. by glow
discharge in SiF4-H2 mixtures) of amorphous Si-F-H semiconductors,1 as well as for plasma deposition of
low-dielectric Si-O-F thin solid ﬁlms.3 It is the main by-product of beam etching of both semiconductors with
ﬂuorine, and silicon dioxide with ﬂuorocarbons.4 In addition to being used to monitor the above processes
[see e.g. Ref. 5], SiF4 has been proposed6 as a remote volcano monitoring probe, since its presence can
be measured using open-path FT-IR spectroscopy of ν3(SiF4). Finally, the isotopic separation of 30Si (in
30SiF4) by infrared multi-photon dissociation (IRMPD) of natural-abundance Si2F6 using CO2 lasers has
been reported on a preparative scale.7

A key step for elucidating these processes is to understand the equilibrium structure, spectroscopy and
energetics of these molecules. For these reasons the vibrational spectroscopy of the above molecules has
been the subject of several theoretical and experimental studies. It is also the subject of the present paper
in which we apply a combination of an accurate ab initio electronic structure treatment and a high-order
CVPT treatment of the vibrational problem to the CF4 and SiF4 molecules.

Early gas-phase spectroscopic measurements of the CF4 molecule8,9 have been reviewed and supplemented
by Jones, Kennedy, and Ekberg (JKE).10 Earlier, Jeannotte et al.11 obtained spectra in liquid argon solution,
which as expected diﬀer considerably from the JKE results due to solvent shifts. Early high-resolution work
on the molecule was stimulated by the announcement12 of mid-infrared CF4 lasing based on the ν2 + ν4 →
ν2
transition. Esherick et al.13 determined ν1 to high resolution by inverse Raman spectroscopy. High-resolution

Raman spectroscopy of ν2 was carried out by Lolck,14 and of 2ν2 and ν1 by Tabyaoui et al.15 The ν2 + ν4
combination band was measured to high accuracy by Patterson et al.16 and by Poussigue et al.17 The ν4 band
was studied extensively by Jones et al.,9 by Tarrago et al.,18 and by McDowell et al.,19 the latter of whom
determined ν4 for all three isotopic species with Doppler-limited resolution. Doppler-limited measurements
of the 2v1 + ν4 combination band were published by two diﬀerent groups.20,21 A Fermi type 1 interaction
exists between 2ν4 and ν3;22 detailed analyses of the ν3 and 2ν3
23 and of the ν3/2ν4 polyad24 have been
carried out.

The spectroscopic studies of CF4 have been accompanied by several theoretical (spectroscopic) inves-
tigations. Harmonic valence force ﬁelds were ﬁrst derived by by Duncan and Mills25 and by Chalmers
and McKean.26 Jeannotte et al.27 ﬁtted a harmonic potential, supplemented by diagonal cubic and quartic
stretching force constants only, to their earlier11 liquid argon solution measurements. Brodersen28 obtained
a cubic force ﬁeld from experimental rotation-vibration data. A quartic force ﬁeld is said to be partly reﬁned
to rovibrational levels below 1400 cm−1, but detailed information about the ﬁtting is unavailable so far.29
At higher energies, Boujut et al.30 consider local and normal mode behavior in the ν3 and ν4 ladders of
tetrahedral XY4 and octahedral XY6 molecules, with CF4 being considered among the former.
In their
analysis they employ data from Ref. 24 as computerized into the STDS data bank.31 The nν3 ladder has
also been found to be a good testing ground for comparing experiment and theory. Using their results of
high-resolution proton energy loss spectroscopy, Maring et al.,32 review earlier data for ν3, 2ν3, and 3ν3.
They also summarize earlier unpublished data by Heenan33 who derived two sets of Hecht34-type anharmonic
constants (to be denoted Heenan I and Heenan II in the remainder of the paper) from ﬁtting Urey-Bradley
type force ﬁelds to the Jeannotte11 and JKE data, respectively. Maring et al. propose some alterations
based on their measurements, including an apparently exceptionally large value for X33 =

9.1 cm−1.

Early work on the spectroscopy of SiF4 has been reviewed by McDowell et al.,35 who note that research
on the molecule was stimulated by the fact that the ν3 fundamental overlaps the P branch of the 9400 nm
band of the CO2 laser. McDowell and coworkers reported a partial set of anharmonicity constants as well. In
recent theoretical work, the low lying vibrational spectrum of SiF4 has been modeled36,37 using an algebraic
approach.38

Patterson and Pine39 determined B0=0.13676(3) cm−1, whence r0=1.55982(17) ˚A35. In later work, Takami
and Kuze40 and later J¨orissen et al.41 substantially revised B0 upward (to 0.137780439(92) cm−1, consistent
with a substantially shorter r0=1.55404 ˚A). As this paper was being ﬁnalized, we received a preprint by
Demaison et al.42, in which re=1.5524(8) is derived from a combination of ab initio and experimental results.
In the present paper we re-investigate the spectroscopy of these molecules using a combination of accurate
ab initio anharmonic force ﬁelds and advanced techniques for solving the vibrational Schr¨odinger equation.
In an earlier electronic structure study, Martin and Taylor43 revised the heat of vaporization of silicon (which,
among other things, is required for any ab initio or semiempirical calculation of the heat of formation of
any silicon compound) from a benchmark ab initio calculation on SiF4 from a very precise ﬂuorine bomb
calorimetric measurement44 of the heat of formation of SiF4(g) and a benchmark ab initio calculation43 of the
total atomization energy of said molecule. In this paper, the focus is restricted to the molecular vibrations.
In part, we were motivated to study these molecules due to the success of a recent study in which, an ab
initio quartic force ﬁeld for methane45 obtained using large basis sets and coupled cluster methods served as
the starting point for several spectral reﬁnement studies using variational methods,46 low-order perturbation
theory,47 and high-order canonical Van Vleck perturbation theory (CVPT).48 In general, we ﬁnd that only
the quadratic force constants and perhaps the geometry needs to be reﬁned, and most of the remainder of
the force ﬁeld can be constrained to the ab initio values.

II. AB INITIO ANHARMONIC FORCE FIELD

All electronic structure calculations were carried out using MOLPRO 9749 running on an SGI Origin 2000

minisupercomputer at the Weizmann Institute of Science.

Electronic correlation was treated at the CCSD(T) level [coupled cluster with all single and double sub-
stitutions (CCSD)50 supplemented with a quasiperturbative estimate of the contribution of connected triple
excitations51] method, using the implementation thereof in MOLPRO.52 This method is known53 to yield
correlation energies that are very close to the exact basis set correlation energy (i.e. the full conﬁguration
interaction result in the same basis set) as long as correlation is predominantly dynamical in character. As
pointed out previously,43 correlation in SiF4 is essentially purely dynamical in character, and the same holds
T1 diagnostic54 (a measure for the importance of nondynamical
true for CF4. For the record, values for the

2

correlation) are only 0.0118 for SiF4 and 0.0119 for CF4, respectively. (In all calculations reported here, only
valence electrons were correlated.)

Geometry optimizations were carried out by univariate polynomial interpolation. At the reference geome-
try, a quartic force ﬁeld in curvilinear symmetry coordinates was determined by recursive application of the
central ﬁnite diﬀerence formula with step size 0.01 ˚A or radian. (Quartic contamination was removed from
the quadratic force constants.) The symmetry coordinates are the same as those used in the previous study
on CH4.45

The resulting curvilinear internal coordinate force ﬁeld was then transformed to rectilinear normal coor-
dinates, then a standard second-order rovibrational perturbation theory55 was carried out by means of the
SPECTRO program.56,57 The alignment conventions for the anharmonic constants of a spherical top follow
the work of Hecht34 and general formulae for these constants were taken from the paper by Hodgkinson et
al..58 (See Section III.B for a discussion about the deﬁnition of the ν2 normal coordinates.) The implementa-
tion in SPECTRO was slightly modiﬁed to allow deperturbing for an arbitrary number of Fermi resonances,59
and a simple routine implementing Hecht’s34 energy level formulas up to four vibrational quanta was added.
Similar procedure has also been implemented in the curvilinear formalism, and the relationship between
the two formalism will be discussed in Section III.B. As in past work (e.g. Ref. 45), correct alignment was
veriﬁed by slightly (0.00001 a.m.u.) perturbing the masses of two atoms, then repeating the analysis in the
asymmetric top formalism.

Given the n3N 4 scaling (with n the number of electrons correlated and N the number of basis functions) of
CPU time for a CCSD(T) calculation, the large number of valence electrons correlated (n=32) imposes certain
restrictions on the size of the basis set for a complete quartic force ﬁeld. We settled on the standard Dunning
cc-pVTZ (correlation consistent polarized valence triple zeta) basis set60,61 (150 contracted Gaussian-type
functions, CGTFs) for CF4, while for SiF4, we opted for the cc-pVTZ+1 basis set (159 CGTFs), where
the suﬃx ”+1” denotes the addition of a single high-exponent d function on second-row elements62 to
accommodate inner polarization eﬀects. The latter has been repeatedly shown to be essential for accurate
computed properties of second-row molecules with polar bonds,62–64 and the addition of a mere ﬁve functions
to the basis set increases CPU time insigniﬁcantly for our purposes. It should be pointed out that even with
these relatively compact basis sets, the evaluation of each force ﬁeld took the equivalent of six weeks of CPU
time on the SGI Origin.

For purposes of validation, we in addition calculated geometries and harmonic frequencies at the CCSD(T)
level with a number of other basis sets. For CF4, we considered the (diﬀuse-function) augmented cc-pVTZ
basis set aug-cc-pVTZ of Kendall et al.65 (230 CGTFs), while for SiF4, we considered both the standard
cc-pVTZ basis set (154 CGTFs) and the aug-cc-pVTZ+1 basis set (239 CGTFs), in which the ”+1” suﬃx
again denotes the addition of an inner-polarization d function. The results are collected in Tables I and II.
For CF4, the main deﬁciency appears to be that the asymmetric stretching frequency ω3 is seriously over-
estimated. This is a known problem for polar bonds, particularly those involving ﬂuorine .66–68 Increasing
the basis set size to cc-pVQZ (275 CGTFs) or even cc-pV5Z (455 CGTFs) as a rule does not remedy this
problem66,68 — and given the N 4 scaling behavior would increase CPU time requirements by one and two or-
ders of magnitude, respectively, and would therefore be essentially impossible. The use of anion basis set (i.e.
aug-cc-pVnZ) on at least the electronegative atoms themselves generally leads to a dramatic improvement in
basis set convergence,66–68 and here too we see that CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVTZ frequencies for CF4 are much
closer to the ﬁnal adjusted values than the CCSD(T)/cc-pVTZ values. While in HF, this sensitivity extends
to the anharmonicities,68 in heavy-atom systems like FNO and ClNO67 the anharmonicities are generally
unaﬀected by this change. We have therefore chosen not to calculate the entire anharmonic force ﬁeld at the
CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVTZ level, which would have increased CPU time requirements approximately ﬁvefold.
Interestingly, the eﬀect of adding the anion functions is much less pronounced for SiF4 than it is for CF4.
The eﬀect of adding the inner polarization function is fairly pronounced on the bond distance (a decrease
of almost 0.01 ˚A), but eﬀects on the harmonic frequencies are fairly minor. Here too, we judged that the
CCSD(T)/cc-pVTZ+1 level represented the best compromise between accuracy and computational cost for
the entire anharmonic force ﬁeld.

Purely ab initio calculation of the geometry and the harmonic part of the potential would presumably be
feasible as far as basis set convergence and inner-shell correlation corrections are concerned, but we know
from experience68 that imperfections in the CCSD(T) method might still account for (usually positive) errors
of several cm−1 in the frequencies. Full conﬁguration interaction calculations are out of the question for this
system, and hence we have followed a diﬀerent track similar to previous work on silane,69 and reﬁned the
‘raw’ CCSD(T)/cc-pVTZ and CCSD(T)/cc-pVTZ+1 force ﬁelds in the following way.

(1) Using standard second-order rovibrational perturbation theory, the four vibrational fundamentals for
the most abundant isotopomer were obtained, together with the equilibrium and ground-state rotational

3

constants Be and B0, respectively. Hence (as re

Be/B0) the computed r0 was obtained.

(2) Using the internal coordinate force ﬁeld given above, the four diagonal quadratic force constants and
re were then iteratively adjusted such that the fundamentals and r0 obtained by second-order rovibrational
perturbation theory coincide with the experimental values to the precision given. (F47 and all cubic and
quartic force constants were held at their ab initio computed values.) This process converged after three
iterations, and the ﬁnal force ﬁelds are given in Table III. This force ﬁeld was then used as input for the
higher-order vibrational analysis.

p

As can be seen in Tables I and II, the adjustment only entails relatively minor changes in the geometry
and harmonic frequencies. In addition, overall agreement between the available experimental energy levels
and the values computed using standard second-order perturbation theory is such that we conclude that
the CCSD(T)/VTZ(+1) quartic force ﬁelds are of suﬃcient quality for our purposes. (Since the computed
energy levels are essentially identical to those obtained by means of second-order CVPT if no resonances are
accounted for, the reader is referred to Tables VI and VIII and the relevant sections below for details.)

Concerning the equilibrium geometries, we note that our ﬁnal re values for CF4 and SiF4 agree with
the experimentally derived values of Brodersen28 and Demaison et al.,42 respectively, to within their stated
uncertainties.

III. CALCULATION OF VIBRATION ENERGY LEVELS

In this and the following two sections, in order to assess the accuracy of the ab initio force ﬁeld, the
vibrational energy levels of CF4 and SiF4 are calculated using high order canonical Van Vleck perturbation
theory(CVPT) and compared to the experimental data. The calculation is similar to that which has been
recently applied to the methane and its isotopomers. Details about this calculation can be found in Ref. 48,
and only the major procedures will be summarized here.

Firstly the exact J = 0 vibrational Hamiltonian including the pseudo-potential V ′ term70 is expanded
in terms of the curvilinear normal coordinates based on the Morse coordinates for the stretch and angle
extension coordinates for the bend. The redundancy relation between the six bond angles is properly taken
into account in the expansion. As in the case of methane and its isotopomers,48 the kinetic energy operators
are expanded to fourth order, even though CVPT is carried out to a higher order. We choose this scheme
because the kinetic contributions of order higher than four are believed to be small, and the number of terms
rapidly increases with the order of the expansion. The quartic potential which is already in expanded form
is used throughout this work. It contributes to the CVPT up to the second order. It is re-expressed in the
coordinates described above so that the new expansion of the potential agrees with the original potential up
to quartic terms.

The expanded Hamiltonian is separated in the form

Hv = H (0) + λH (1) + λ2H (2) +

+ λnH (n),

· · ·

where λ is the perturbation parameter. A succession of canonical transformations of the form

Kv = exp
{

iλn[S(n), ]

exp
{

iλ2[S(2), ]
}

exp
{

iλ[S(1), ]
}

} · · ·

are then applied to the Hamiltonian of Eq. (1), where the S(n) are chosen such that the matrix representation
of Kv is block diagonal through order n.71,72 The blocks are characterized by one or more polyad quantum
numbers

(1)

(2)

(3)

Nt =

mivi,

Xi

where the integers mi deﬁne the block. These integers are chosen such that the resonance interactions are
not perturbatively decoupled. Details regarding the choice of the polyad quantum numbers will be discussed
later with respect to speciﬁc molecules.

Two points, regarding our analysis of this Hamiltonian are now considered in more detail. First, in order to
obtain and analyze the eigenvalues of the individual blocks we diagonalize each block in a symmetrized basis
to reduce the matrix size and to help assign the calculated levels. Second, the transformed (eﬀective) Hamil-
tonian of Eq. (2) at second order is particularly interesting as its coeﬃcients are the quartic anharmonicity
constants and resonance constants, which have been conventionally used by spectroscopists to highlight the
features of the vibrational spectra. In the following two subsections we discuss the basis symmetrization and
extraction of spectroscopic constants as they have not been given in our previous work.48

A. Symmetrization in the Cartesian basis for the Td point group

There are generally two ways of choosing basis functions for the doubly and triply degenerated normal
modes for the Td group molecules. The ﬁrst choice (angular momentum basis) are eigenfunctions of the
vibrational angular momenta. The second choice (Cartesian basis) is the products of harmonic oscillator
functions including diﬀerent Cartesian components of the degenerate vibrations. In the angular momentum
basis, the oﬀ-diagonal terms are the spherical tensor operators deﬁned by Hecht34 and their matrix elements
are calculated using the Wigner-Eckart theorem. However it is more diﬃcult to treat vibrational resonances
in the angular momentum basis, and therefore the alternative Cartesian basis is more often used. Another
advantage of the Cartesian basis is that the matrix elements are readily calculated since they all reduce to
one-dimensional harmonic oscillator matrix elements. For both basis, the symmetrization is nonobvious and
we are going to discuss the symmetrization in the Cartesian basis below.

ducible representations of the Td point group: A1, A2, E, F1 and F2. Various equivalent approaches can be
used, such as the projection operator technique,47,73 and the promotion operator technique with tabulated
vector coupling coeﬃcients.74,75 The vector coupling coeﬃcients (also called Clebsch-Gordan coeﬃcients)

and

First of all, the overtone of the E (ν2) and F2 (ν3 and ν4 ) normal modes are symmetrized separately.
For the symmetrization of the overtone of the E normal modes, the promotion operators technique with
tabulated vector coupling coeﬃcients has been used in Ref. 75. The method is summarized as follows. The
promotion operators with (Ea, Eb) symmetry are the familiar creation operators which act on the basis by

Taking the promotion operators to belong to (Ea, Eb) symmetries, the symmetry of the resultant promoted
basis function can be identiﬁed according to the vector coupling coeﬃcients. Starting from the v=1 basis
function, one can derive all the symmetrized basis functions until v reaches a given number similar to
climbing a v ladder. A computer code is desirable if one wants to symmetrize a high overtone. One problem
is that spurious states with the same symmetry may arise if the promotion operator acts on every basis,
and they are not orthogonal. For example, with promotion operators acting on the full 3ν2 symmetrized
basis (A1 + A2 + E), three nonorthogonal E states are obtained while only two are allowed for 4ν2. These
spurious states are removed by using the Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization technique. The ﬁnal orthogonal
symmetrized basis is not unique, but all possible solutions lead to symmetrized Hamiltonian matrix blocks.
An alternative method, which yields unique symmetrization coeﬃcients, is obtainedby ﬁnding the exact
decomposition of the angular momentum basis function into the Cartesian basis wavefunction.Once this is
done, the symmetrization is trivial as the angular momentum basis function is readily symmetrized according
to the value of l modulo 3. This task seems quite complicated since the angular momentum basis functions are
basically the associated Laguerre polynomials and the Cartesian basis functions are essentially products of
two Hermite polynomials.78,79 In fact, this complication can be circumvented by using the circular promotion
operators deﬁned by80

where l = 3p. There is only A1 symmetry if l is zero. Pak et al.81 have also discussed a similar scheme to
transform the angular momentum basis functions to the real cosine and sine form, which are members of
the irreducible representation of the D3h group. It should be noted that the above results can be applied to
other analogous doubly degenerated modes such as the E mode in the C3v group and the Eg mode in the Oh
group. The above procedure can be easily implemented by a computer code. Results up to v = 8 are listed
in Table IV, which are obtained from a code in the Maple82 computer algebra language. These results may
be useful for other applications. A fortran code is also written for the same purpose and is to be combined
with the symmetrization of the F2 normal mode to form a general symmetrization package.

Now we turn to the symmetrization of the overtone of the F2 normal mode. This can also be achieved
using the promotion operators together with the vector coupling coeﬃcients. However there exist general
rules on how a given overtone is symmetrized without resorting to promotion of lower states. These general
rules can be derived using the projection operator methods. Roughly speaking, one obtains AE symmetry
when the three Cartesian quantum numbers are all even or odd, and F symmetry when they are mixed even
and odd. Detailed symmetrization coeﬃcients have been given in Table 2 of Ref. 30 for the overtone of the
triply degenerated modes (F1 and F2 modes of Td group) of Oh and Td group.

Finally given the fact that the E overtone and F2 overtone have been symmetrized separately, the com-
bination bands in the form (n1n2n3n4) can be symmetrized using the vector coupling coeﬃcients, as has
been demonstrated in Ref. 75. In this process, no spurious states arise as the basis functions joining the
product are from diﬀerent normal modes. All the above steps have been implemented as a Fortran code
which writes to a ﬁle the symmetrization coeﬃcients for all the combination bands in a polyad with a given
polyad number. This is highly desirable since one may encounter completely diﬀerent polyad numbers such
as those for CH4, CF4 and SiF4. These symmetrization coeﬃcients are further used in constructing the
polyad block matrix of the transformed Hamiltonian.

It is interesting to compare with the basis symmetrization for the Td group in the algebraic model.83–85 A
key diﬀerence is that the basis functions symmetrized there are products of ten functions based on the ten

6

internal coordinates. Due to the redundancy between the six bond-angle coordinates considerable eﬀort was
required to remove the so-called spurious states.83,84 Their symmetrization procedure is basically the same
as the promotion operator technique with tabulated vector coupling coeﬃcients.74,75 Lemus and Frank83
have also tabulated and derived part of the vector coupling coeﬃcients in the Td group, unaware of an earlier
full tabulation.77,76

B. Extraction of spectroscopic constants

The spectroscopic constants we want to extract from our second order transformed Hamiltonian are
speciﬁcally the quartic anharmonicity constants Xij, Gij , the tensor constants Tij and Sij and the cubic
Ki,jk and quartic resonance constants Ki,jkl and Kij,kl. The quartic anharmonicity constants Xij and Gij
have their usual deﬁnitions. The tensor constants were deﬁned by Hecht34 as coeﬃcients of spherical tensor
operators which cause splittings of the same symmetry components of the overtone and combination bands of
spherical top molecules. This procedure has been used in earlier work on the acetylene molecule,86 however
the procedure used was not described. More importantly, the procedure has not been applied to molecules
of Td symmetry which present a special challenge. For these reasons we describe the procedure in full detail
here.

The apparent diﬃculty of the extraction is that our CVPT results for the transformed Hamiltonian are
expressed as expansions of creation-annihilation operators in normal form71,72 — the creation operators are
put before the annihilation operators. These expansion terms need to be rearranged to obtain the traditional
spectroscopic Hamiltonian. A simple example based on second order perturbation theory serves to illustrate
this point. At second order the normal form expansion includes contributions, such as (a†
1)2(a1)2 = ˆn1(ˆn1−
1),
a†
1a1 = ˆn1 plus a constant. It is found that by rearranging the normal form terms as powers of ( ˆn1 + 1
2 ),
all the linear contributions to second order of perturbation theory cancel, leaving the Hamiltonian in the
standard spectroscopic form where only quadratic terms such as ( ˆn1 + 1
2 )2 contribute. With either choice of
expansion the leading term will have the same coeﬃcient which is X11.

A similar problem has been studied by Hodgkinson et al.58 who have suggested the same idea of extracting
spectroscopic constants from the second order transformed Hamiltonian, although the Hamiltonian discussed
there is in rectilinear normal coordinates and the creation-annihilation operators are not rearranged to normal
form. Furthermore, the extraction of constants related with doubly and triply degenerated modes requires one
more step than the above simple example of X11. For example, the tensor constants T23 and anharmonicity
constants X23 are determined simultaneously by

Coef(ˆn2a ˆn2z) = X23 + 8T23
8T23
Coef(ˆn2b ˆn2z) = X23 −

(12)

where Coef(ˆo) denotes coeﬃcient of operator ˆo, and ˆn2a ˆn2z and ˆn2bˆn2z are the leading terms in the normal
form Hamiltonian. These formulae are readily obtained by rewriting the O23 operator which was deﬁned by
Hecht [Eq. (8) of Ref. 34] as an operator whose coeﬃcients are T23. Such formulae for all the anharmonicity
and tensor constants have been given in Table 5 of Ref. 58.

Here one has to take care of a convention problem regarding the deﬁnition of normal/symmetry coordinates
for the ν2 (E) mode of a tetrahedral molecule. We notice that Jahn deﬁned the symmetry coordinate
(Q2a, Q2b) on page 472 of Ref. 87 (See Fig. 1 of Ref. 88 for the numbering of the four peripheral atoms).
His deﬁnition and the vector coupling coeﬃcients for the E mode coupling other modes (Table II of Ref. 89)
were adopted by Hecht in Ref. 34. Unfortunately the symmetry coordinates (S2a, S2b) for the ν2 mode we
and many other researchers90,45,75,47 adopted are those of Mills.91,90 After some manipulations, it is found
that the two deﬁnitions are related such that Q2a =
S2b, Q2b = S2a. If one uses Mills’ deﬁnition, all the
−
Hecht formulae regarding the ν2 mode should be modiﬁed according to the above relationship. The only
signiﬁcant change occurs with the O23 operator for which a minus sign needs to be attached to Hecht’s
deﬁnition. Only after this correction is considered, can the Table 5 of Hodgkinson et al. be reconciled with
Hecht’s deﬁnition. Eq. (12) is a pertinent example. Finally, it is noted that the vector coupling coeﬃcients
tabulated by Tababe and Sugano77 and Griﬃth76 agree with Mills’ deﬁnition of the symmetry coordinates
of ν2.

The extraction of the resonance constants is straightforward in the creation-annihilation form since they
are usually deﬁned in this form. One just needs to take care of constructing the correctly symmetrized
Hamiltonian terms for the resonance. To this end, several equivalent approaches can be used. Other than
the method by Hecht34,92 for constructing the correctly symmetrized potential tensor operators, we choose

(18)

to follow an elegant and more general approach by Halonen75 who used the tabulated vector coupling
coeﬃcients to construct the correctly symmetrized Hamiltonian terms from any combination of operators
such as coordinates, momenta and creation-annihilation operators. Methane has a variety of cubic and
quartic resonances due to its approximate 2:1 ratio of the stretch and bend frequency. Halonen has given for
the ﬁrst time all the correctly symmetrized Darling-Dennison type quartic resonance terms in Ref. 75 using
the vector coupling methods. The resonance constants encountered in CF4 and SiF4 are limited compared
to methane. Up to second order resonance, they are (See also Eqs. (19) – (21) and (23) – (25))

for SiF4. The quartic resonance with coeﬃcient K1,222 is of a new type. We shall show how it is derived
to illustrate the vector coupling method. The goal is to construct the totally symmetric (A1 symmetry)
quartic terms from one creation operator (a†
1) with A1 symmetry and two annihilation operators (a2a, a2b)
with E symmetry. Apparently there is only one such term. First the Ea/Eb symmetry quadratic terms are
constructed from products of (a2a, a2b) and themselves as follows

Then the A1 symmetry cubic terms are constructed from products of (a2a, a2b) and the two terms of Eq. (17)
as follows

Finally the A1 symmetry quartic term is obtained as product of a†
1 and terms of Eq. (18) plus the Hermite
conjugate of the product. The coeﬃcient of the ﬁnal resonance term in Eq. (16) has been redeﬁned for
convenience.

An interesting point is that the anharmonicity and tensor constants extracted using the method above agree
exactly with standard second-order perturbation theory in rectilinear normal coordinates as implemented
in SPECTRO, provided that the same force ﬁeld is used and no resonances are considered. This seems to
be a surprise, since the reported CVPT results are based on curvilinear coordinates. McCoy and Sibert93
have explained this as follows. When using dimensionless normal coordinates the perturbation parameter
in the expansion of Eq. (1) can be taken as ¯h1/2. Here terms of order n in Eq. (1) are of order ¯h(2+n)/2.
This is true regardless of using rectilinear or curvilinear normal coordinates. Since both sets have identical
zero-order Hamiltonians, the energies have to be identical order by order. If one uses perturbation theory
to transform to block-diagonal Hamiltonian, which is subsequently diagonalized, the above argument breaks
down, and notable diﬀerences have been found.94,95 In this work, a multi-resonance Hamiltonian has been
considered for CF4 and SiF4. Therefore the spectroscopic constants are extracted from the second order
CVPT transformed Hamiltonian, and some of them are diﬀerent from those obtained using SPECTRO with
resonances deperturbed. More details regarding this point are given with respect to CF4 and SiF4 molecules
in the following section.

The choice of the polyad quantum numbers for CF4 is based on the following considerations. The harmonic
frequencies as calculated from the ab initio force ﬁelds (ω1 = 921.57 cm−1, ω2 = 439.91 cm−1, ω3 = 1303.01
cm−1, ω4 = 637.89 cm−1) suggest that three independent resonances are possible:

The frequency diﬀerences between the above pairs are only 42 cm−1, 27 cm−1 and 17 cm−1, respectively.
Since these small diﬀerences will go into the denominator of the expression of S(n), they will possibly lead
to divergence of the perturbation theory when the coupling strength between the two pair states are not
negligible. In practice we found that all the three resonances ought to be considered by keeping them in
the Kv to ensure good convergence when the perturbation theory is carried up to the sixth order. It should
be noted that the resonance in Eq.
(21) is actually a fourth order resonance, because the symmetry is
unmatched between 3ν2 and ν3 at second order. Due to the three independent resonances, only one good
quantum number remains, which should be orthogonal to the three resonance vectors (1,
2)
and (0,

3, 1, 0). It is then easy to ﬁnd the remaining good quantum number to be

which will be used in the perturbation calculations reported below.

In Table VI, we collected all the reliable experimental band origins of the three isotopes. There are 14
high resolution data (with resolution better than 0.01 cm−1). All the other data with typical 0.1 and 1 cm−1
resolution are from the work of Jones et al..10 There are some other low-resolution data compiled in Ref. 10,
which we found to be unreliable and were discarded. The calculated energy levels based on the adjusted ab
initio force ﬁeld of Table III agree well with the observations. We then further reﬁned all ﬁve quadratic force
constants to the observed levels with uncertainty for each level determined by the experimental precision,
using a fast convergent second order least squares method where the Hessian is approximated as products
of ﬁrst derivatives.96 The reﬁned constants are given in Table V and the comparison of experimental and
calculated energy levels is given in Table VI. The RMSD (root mean squares deviations) based on the reﬁned
potential is 0.179, 0.083 and 0.083 cm−1 at second, fourth and sixth order CVPT, respectively, whereas the
corresponding RMSD based on the ab initio potential in Table III is 0.095, 0.190 and 0.186 cm−1. This shows
that the ab initio potential is a rather good as an initial potential for the ﬁtting. The following remarks can
be made by examining the calculated results in Table VI.

(1) The CVPT calculation converges very well. The energy level changes typically on the order of 0.1 cm−1
by comparing the fourth and sixth order results. This contrasts with the case of CH4 where the bending
overtone (4ν4) varies by about three wavenumbers at the eighth order.48 Therefore the fourth order CVPT
is used for the ﬁtting. The contribution due to the V ′ terms is small. For example, the largest contribution
to the fundamentals is 0.057 cm−1 for (0001;F2) band of 12CF4 using sixth order CVPT.

(2) For 12CF4, the resonance ω3 ≈

2ω4 is the most pronounced. Even the (0010;F2) fundamental has 7
% admixture from (0002;F2). The resonance ω1 ≈
ω3 can
be ignored. The above remarks also apply for the 13CF4 whereas all the three resonances seem to be less
pronounced for 14CF4.

2ω2 is less pronounced and the resonance 3ω2 ≈

2ω4 means that previous treatment for the ν3 ladder states where

only the ν3 overtones are considered are inadequate .23,30,32

The pronounced resonance between ω3 ≈
(3) The calculations for the three (0020) bands using either the ab initio or ﬁtted force ﬁeld cannot
reproduce well the observations which were obtained through a rovibrational analysis of the isolated (0020)
bands.23 We cannot fully understand these discrepancies. But it is clear that the (0020) band is in Fermi
resonance with the (0012) and (0004) bands, although the major perturbant (0012) is a little farther away.
For example, the three (0012;F2) bands are respectively at 2536.50 cm−1, 2541.66 cm−1, and 2544.45 cm−1.
We have also noted that near the experimental (0020;F2) band origins (2561.91 cm−1), there is a band
calculated to be 2561.04 cm−1 with 82%(0302;F2) and 14%(0310;F2). However it is very unlikely that this
band should be as strong as the (0020;F2) band. Further theoretical and experimental work on this band
system appears to be desirable.

Finally, the vibrational spectroscopic constants for all the isotopes of CF4 and SiF4 obtained from the
second order transformed CVPT Hamiltonian (curvilinear formalism) are given in Table VII. With these con-
stants one can reproduce the second order CVPT calculation by constructing the block diagonal Hamilonian
matrices. The corresponding constants in the rectilinear formalism, where diﬀerent, are given in footnotes
to said table. The diﬀerences (for the Fermi resonance constants and for such anharmonic constants as are
aﬀected by the Fermi interactions) illustrate the points made in the previous section.

Discrepancies between the presently computed anharmonicity constants and the empirically derived sets
of Heenan33 mostly reﬂect the limitations of the latter in terms of available data. There is no indication

(26)

The diﬀerences between the above pairs are only 27 cm−1, 27 cm−1, and 11 cm−1, respectively. Again all
three resonances ought to be considered to ensure good convergence when the perturbation theory is carried
up to sixth order. It should be noted that the resonance in Eq. (24) is actually a third order resonance,
because the symmetry is unmatched between ν1 + ν2 (F2) and ν3 (E) at ﬁrst order. Following the approach
of the previous section the good quantum number, to be used in the perturbative calculations, is found to
be

N = 6v1 + 2v2 + 8v3 + 3v4

which we are going to use in the perturbation calculations reported below.

The sixteen observed band centers from Ref. 35 and the values of the second, fourth and sixth order CVPT

calculations are given in Table VIII. The following remarks can be made by examining Table VIII.

(1) The calculated values converges to a few hundredths of a wavenumber by comparing the fourth and
sixth order results. The convergence is better than in the case of CF4. The contribution due to the V ′ terms
is small. For example, the largest contribution to the fundamentals is 0.0016 cm−1 for (0001;F2) band of
28SiF4 using sixth order CVPT. This is smaller than that of the 12CF4 since SiF4 is heavier.

νi values in Tables I and II).

(2) The agreement between calculation and experiment is rather good with a RMSD of 0.59, 0.74 and
0.73 cm−1 at second, fourth and sixth order CVPT, respectively. It should be noted that the slightly better
agreement at the second order is fortuitous as the second order results still do not converge. On the whole,
the CVPT results are remarkable in spite of the fact that the CVPT calculation uses the ab initio force ﬁeld
where only four diagonal quadratic force constants were optimized to the four experimental fundamentals.
The success of the perturbation calculation is mainly due to the small anharmonicity for this relatively
heavy-atom molecule (cfr. the ωi −
(3) In Table VIII our calculations are compared with those of the U (2) algebraic model.36 Although the
U (2) algebraic model yields a similar RMSD (0.79 cm−1), nine parameters were employed to ﬁt the sixteen
vibrational data. A ﬁt of similar quality is also reported by the same authors37 using a boson realization
model. However, in both models the polyad number N = v1 + v2 + v3 + v4 is used and the Fermi resonance
ω1 ≈
2ω4 is most prominent. The other two
resonances are also considered to ensure good convergence at sixth order. To neglect these two resonances
will considerably reduce the size of the matrix associated with a given value of the quantum number, so that
high overtone states can be relatively easier to calculate. The lack of strong resonance in ν3 and its overtone
ensures that the isolated treatment of the ν3 overtone is a good approximation.39 Patterson and Pine has
done such a calculation, and ﬁnd the Cartesian basis is much inferior to the angular momentum basis due
to the near degeneracy of the Cartesian basis. This near degeneracy is speciﬁc to SiF4 since the relation
G33 = 8T33 is nearly satisﬁed.39 However, as far as the calculation of the vibrational energy is concerned,
both basis sets can be used.

(4) It can be seen from Table VIII that the resonance ω1 ≈

2ω4 is considered in neither.

The partial set of empirically derived anharmonicity constants (Table VII) of McDowell et al.35 agrees
fairly well with our computed values, while their derived harmonic frequencies agree to within their stated
uncertainty with our own best values.

VI. CONCLUSIONS

The anharmonic vibrational spectra of the all-heavy atom spherical tops CF4 and SiF4 have been treated
by the combination of an accurate ab initio anharmonic force ﬁeld and high-order canonical Van Vleck
perturbation theory (CVPT).

The anharmonic part of the potential energy surface is evidently very well described at the CCSD(T)/cc-
pVTZ level for CF4, and at the CCSD(T)/cc-pVTZ+1 level for SiF4, where the ‘+1’ notation refers to
the addition of a high-exponent d function on second-row atoms. The harmonic frequencies of CF4 exhibit
substantial errors at the CCSD(T)/cc-pVTZ level, which disappear upon addition of diﬀuse functions to the
basis set.

The force ﬁeld is subsequently slightly reﬁned by adjusting the equilibrium geometry and the diagonal
quadratic force constants (in this case, ﬁve parameters) such that a standard second-order rovibrational
perturbation theoretical treatment reproduces the experimental fundamentals and ground-state rotational
constants of the molecules. The adjustments involved are fairly minor.

These force ﬁelds were then used as input for CVPT calculations up to sixth order inclusive. While
agreement with experiment is fortuitously quite good at second order in CVPT, consistent convergence to
0.1 cm−1 in the energy level is only achieved at sixth order. However, the truncation error at second order
is much less signiﬁcant than in the case of hydride systems like CH4 and SiH4.

RMS deviation (RMSD) between computed (sixth order CVPT) and observed energy levels with the
adjusted ab initio potentials is 0.19 cm−1 for CF4 and 0.73 cm−1 for SiF4, the latter to some extent reﬂecting
the lesser accuracy of the experimental data. In the case of CF4, improvement with experiment could be
somewhat further improved (to RMSD=0.08 cm−1) by re-adjusting both diagonal and oﬀ-diagonal quadratic
force constants to the complete set of experimental vibrational level information. Experimentation with
reﬁnement of additional force ﬁeld parameters yielded no further improvement.

This shows that an isolated ν3 overtone ladder model is inadequate. For SiF4, three resonances, Eqs. (19)–
(21), were considered, of which only one (ω1 ≈
An improved approach for symmetrizing combination bands in the Cartesian basis for the Td group is
proposed. We also demonstrate how anharmonic spectroscopic constants Xij , Gij, Tij, Sij can be extracted
from the second-order CVPT transformed Hamiltonian (in curvilinear internal coordinates) for Td molecules.
In the absence of resonances, the results are identical to those obtained by standard second-order perturbation
theory in rectilinear normal coordinates. Diﬀerences occur when the constants are being deperturbed for
Fermi resonances. Accurate sets of quartic spectroscopic constants for the isotomomers of CF4 and SiF4 are
obtained. Agreement with previously published empirically derived sets of anharmonicity constants is fairly
good for SiF4, but less satisfactory for CF4.

In order to stimulate further research on these molecules, sixth-order CVPT energy level predictions up to
polyad number N = 24 for {12,13,14}CF4 and {28,29,30}SiF4 have been made available on the World Wide Web
at the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) http://theochem.weizmann.ac.il/web/papers/cf4sif4.html.

59 This is fairly trivially done by taking apart the compound fractions in Eq.(3.20) of Ref. 58, then inserting a test that
skips the appropriate one among the four aﬀected terms if the respective denominator corresponds to the resonant
interaction. Alternatively, the reciprocal denominators may be precomputed and stored in a 3-dimensional array,
and any that correspond to resonant interactions set to zero before the actual spectroscopy routines are entered,
similar to J. M. L. Martin and P. R. Taylor, Spectrochim. Acta A 53, 1039 (1997).

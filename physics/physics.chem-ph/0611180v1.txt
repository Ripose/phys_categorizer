Abstract

The derivative discontinuity of the exchange-correlation functional of density-functio-
nal theory is cast as the diﬀerence of two types of electron aﬃnities. We approx-
imately evaluate this diﬀerence via ordinary Kohn-Sham calculations, obtaining
estimates of the discontinuity for light atoms and for polyacetylene oligomers. The
discontinuity is found to be quite large (typically several eV), and signiﬁcantly and
consistently improves the agreement of the calculated fundamental energy gap with
the experimental gaps. For atoms, the error of the HOMO-LUMO gap is reduced
in this way by more than one order of magnitude.

Key words: density-functional theory, energy gap, derivative discontinuity,
polymers

From spectroscopy to transport, there is hardly any property of a quantum
many-particle system that does not in some way depend on whether there is a
gap in the energy spectrum, and what the size of this gap is. The fundamental
gap is a ground-state property of a many-body system, deﬁned as Eg = [E(N −
1) − E(N)] − [E(N) − E(N + 1)], where E(N − 1) − E(N) is the energy change
upon removing the N’th particle from the N particle system, E(N)−E(N +1)
that upon removing the N + 1st particle from the N + 1 particle system, and
the E(N) are total ground-state energies. In a noninteracting system this
deﬁnition reduces to the HOMO-LUMO gap between single-particle levels. In
solids, the particle-removal energies are related to the chemical potential, and

for ﬁnite systems they are given by the ionization energy and electron aﬃnity,
respectively.

Density-functional theory (DFT) [1,2] provides, in addition to the ground-
state density and related quantities, also a set of single-particle eigenvalues,
the so-called Kohn-Sham (KS) spectrum. The diﬀerence between the energy
of the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied of these single-particle levels
is the KS HOMO-LUMO gap in ﬁnite systems, or the KS bandstructure gap
in extended solids. It is well known that neither the KS nor the Hartree-Fock
HOMO-LUMO gap correspond to the experimental gap, the former typically
being too small and the latter too large.

Generally, one can write Eg = EKS
g + ∆xc, which deﬁnes ∆xc as the diﬀerence
between the exact fundamental gap and the exact KS HOMO-LUMO gap. In
open systems, all three quantities in this deﬁnition are related to derivative
discontinuities of universal density functionals [3,4,5]. The fundamental gap is
the derivative discontinuity of the total energy

In these equations η stands for an inﬁnitesimal variation of the system’s par-
ticle number. Equation (3) shows that ∆xc is a system-dependent shift of the
xc potential vxc(r) as it passes from the electron-poor to the electron-rich side
of integer N.

Theses three relations are useless to calculate gaps from most currently avail-
able approximate density functionals, which typically have no discontinu-
ities. For two of the three quantities above, alternative ways of calculation,
more useful in practice, are widely known. Total energies are calculated eas-
ily from DFT, so that one can employ the deﬁnition of ionization energy
I = E(N − 1) − E(N) and electron aﬃnity A = E(N) − E(N + 1) to calculate

Single-particle energies are obtained from the KS equation, as a byproduct of
calculating the total energies, and yield the KS HOMO-LUMO gap

EKS

g = ǫN +1(N) − ǫN (N),

where ǫM (N) denotes the M’th eigenvalue of the N-electron system. The
third term, the xc discontinuity ∆xc, has resisted all attempts of describing
it directly by common density functionals, such as LDA and GGA, which are
continuous as a function of N and thus have no xc discontinuity. Indirect
calculation of ∆xc by subtracting (5) from (4) requires separate self-consistent
calculations for the N, N −1 and N +1-particle systems, and involves numerical
diﬀerences of numbers that individually are much larger than ∆xc. For both
of these reasons this becomes impractical for larger systems. In practice, the
contribution of ∆xc to the gap is hard to estimate.

In atomic physics and quantum chemistry, the importance of a nonzero deriva-
tive discontinuity ∆xc for chemical hardness is well known [2,6]. Neglect of
∆xc has also been shown to lead to large errors in the calculation of Rydberg
excitations [7,8], charge-transfer processes and transport [9,10], and the ion-
ization probability of atoms exposed to strong electromagnetic ﬁelds [11]. In
semiconductors, approximate energy gaps calculated in DFT often drastically
underestimate the experimental gap [13,14]. In Mott insulators particular, the
entire gap is due to ∆xc [3,12]. Recently it was pointed out that a similar dis-
continuity problem can also appear in the spin-DFT calculation of spin gaps
in materials relevant for spintronics [15]. The question whether the neglect
of ∆xc or the error in EKS,approx
is responsible for the underestimate of the
band gap in solids is considered in a standard textbook in the ﬁeld to be ‘of
tremendous practical importance’ [1], and the calculation of ∆xc is ranked in
a recent monograph as ‘certainly one of the major outstanding problems in
contemporary DFT’ [16], but no general answer is known.

In the present paper we draw attention to an alternative representation of ∆xc,
which casts it not as a derivative discontinuity but as a diﬀerence of single-
particle eigenvalues, similar to the KS gap. We point out that this relation
provides a simple physical interpretation of the elusive xc discontinuity, and
use it to estimate xc discontinuities of light atoms. The resulting correction

xc substantially improves agreement with experimental fundamental gaps,
reducing the error by more than a factor of 10. To show that the proposed
scheme remains viable for more complex systems, we also present data on
trans-polyacetylene (tPAC).

The basic formula follows from the fact that I and A can be calculated in DFT
not only from ground-state energies, but also from single-particle eigenvalues,
according to I = −ǫN (N) and A = −ǫN +1(N + 1) (the analogue of Koopmans’
theorem in DFT) [1,17]. By using these relations and the deﬁnition of EKS
one ﬁnds, upon combining Eqs. (4) and (5) [18],

g

Eg = ǫN +1(N) − ǫN (N) + ∆xc = ǫN +1(N + 1) − ǫN (N),

which implies

∆xc = ǫN +1(N + 1) − ǫN +1(N) = AKS − A.

In the last step we used the fact that the aﬃnity of the KS system, AKS, is sim-
ply the negative of the energy of the lowest unoccupied orbital. The extreme
right-hand-side of Eq. (7) provides an intuitive interpretation of the disconti-
nuity: in an interacting system, the electrons repell, hence the energy cost of
removing the outermost electron from the negative species (which is measured
by the electron aﬃnity) is reduced, A < AKS, and a positive ∆xc results. In the
following, we exploit Eq. (7) to calculate ∆xc for atoms and semiconducting
polymers. This procedure requires only two self-consistent calculations, and
obtains ∆xc as a diﬀerence of two numbers of size much closer to ∆xc itself
than E(N).

If the right-hand side of Eq. (7) could be calculated exactly, this procedure
would determine the exact xc discontinuity. An estimate of ∆xc is thus ob-
tained by using in (7) the KS eigenvalues obtained in two approximate KS
calculations, one for the neutral species, the other for the anion. Note that
Eq. (7) casts ∆xc as a diﬀerence of two aﬃnities, and while each normally is
predicted wrongly by common functionals (e.g., due to self-interaction errors),
one may expect a large degree of error cancellation between both, leading to
much better values for the diﬀerence than for each aﬃnity individually. We

call this calculation an estimate, and not an approximation, to stress that it
exploits an error cancellation that is hard to quantify a priori. However, we
ﬁnd that this estimate yields results that are in quantitative agreement with
independent alternative calculations and with experiment.

Tables 1 and 2 compare, for 16 light atoms, the experimental gap, the KS
HOMO-LUMO gap, and the DFT gap, deﬁned as the sum of the KS gap and
the estimated xc discontinuity. The KS calculations were performed with the
GAUSSIAN 98 [19] program, and selected results were conﬁrmed by calcula-
tions with GAUSSIAN 03 and GAMESS. The inﬂuence of the choice of the xc
functional and of the basis set on the value of ∆xc will be explored in a sepa-
rate publication. Here, we use the B88-LYP functional and the 6 − 311G(d, p)
basis set. The tables show that the error of the KS gap is signiﬁcantly and
consistently reduced by adding the estimated xc discontinuity to the KS gap,
dropping by more than an order of magnitude — from 7.67eV to 0.606eV
— over the data set in Tables 1 and 2. This large drop, together with the
fact that the improvement is systematic (obtained not only on average, but in
every individual case), strongly suggests that (7) is a reliable and useful way
of obtaining the discontinuity.

Speciﬁcally for the Be atom, we can further compare with independent the-
oretical expectations, because the discontinuity of this atom has previously
been estimated by Jones and Gunnarsson (JG) [20] from numerically exact
KS eigenvalues, obtained earlier by Pedroza and Almbladh [21] from CI densi-
ties and inversion of the KS equation. Our value ∆Be

Figure 1 is a plot of the data in the tables, revealing that ∆xc roughly fol-

for atoms with one electron outside a closed shell, such as Li and Na. The

for systems one electron short of a closed shell, as is seen comparing F with

Ne or Cl with Ar. We interpret this by means of Eq. (7) as a consequence
of the fact that ∆xc is related to two aﬃnities, which involve negative species
with one additional electron, leading to a closed shell for F − and Cl−.

To investigate the applicability of the proposed procedure to more complex
systems, for which CI calculations are out of question, we show in Fig. 2 the
xc discontinuity of tPAC. Figure 2 shows that for small oligomers the size of
the discontinuity is comparable to that observed in atoms. For medium sized
chains, the discontinuity is reduced, and the resulting corrected gap is in the
range 1.5 − 3.5eV , depending on the number of monomers. Calculated gaps
of isolated tPAC chains (see Refs. [23,24] and references therein) range from
1.6eV to 6.1eV . Clearly, our estimate of the corrected gap in isolated ﬁnite
chains is consistent with this range, whereas the uncorrected KS gap is not. On
increasing the monomer number M, our estimates of ∆xc and Eg extrapolate
to 0 approximately as 1/M. This tendency is consistent with experiments for
small oligomers [22], but not with the possibly nonzero gap of an inﬁnite chain.
Clearly, as M → ∞ the small energy change upon adding a single electron
gradually becomes numerically inperceptible, and our estimate should not
necessarily be trusted for large extended systems. A more detailed analysis of
the gap structure of tPAC, a variety of methodological variations of our basic
procedure, and further work on atoms and polymers, will be presented in a
future publication.

In summary, we have cast the derivative discontinuity of DFT as a diﬀerence
of two aﬃnities, Eq. (7), and used approximate calculations of these to obtain
estimates for the discontinuity in light atoms and in a series of polyacetylene

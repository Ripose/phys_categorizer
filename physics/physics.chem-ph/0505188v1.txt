Comment on “Silver nanoparticle array structures that produce remarkably narrow
plasmon lineshapes” [J. Chem. Phys. 120, 10871 (2004)]

(Dated: February 2, 2008)

Recently, Zou, Janel and Schatz (referred to as ZJS
below) have described remarkably narrow plasmon reso-
nances in linear arrays of silver nanospheres [1]. Without
questioning the novelty and signiﬁcance of these results,
I would like to point out that the above-referenced paper
contains two incorrect statements.

The ﬁrst statement is about my previous work.
Namely, ZJS write that in a previous study [2] I have con-
sidered “. . . inﬁnite one-dimensional (1D) arrays in the
quasistatic approximation”. In fact, there was no qua-
sistatic approximation made in Ref. [2]. The approxima-
tion that was made was the dipole approximation. These
two approximations are distinctly diﬀerent. For example,
even in the electrostatic limit, the dipole approximation
is grossly inaccurate for two touching conducting spheres
excited by a constant external electric ﬁeld parallel to
the axis connecting the spheres’ centers [3]. On the other
hand, electromagnetic interaction of small impurities in
a crystal or of dye molecules in large molecular aggre-
gates [4] can not be understood within the quasistatics,
although the dipole approximation may be very accurate
in this case.

Perhaps, the source of confusion is that in Section 2.1
of Ref. [2] I wrote “The object under investigation is a
linear inﬁnite chain with step a consisting of point-like
dipole units (monomers). . . ”. Also, in the introduction
of Ref. [2], I have suggested that the physical system to
which the considered model is applicable is a molecular
aggregate. Later, in Section 5, I have considered a par-
ticular example in which the polarizability of a dipole,
α, was given by the quasistatic polarizability of a small
sphere with the appropriate radiative correction. How-
ever, the theoretical formalism of Ref. [2] did not put any
restrictions on α. And, regardless of the form of α, the
interaction of dipoles was described with full account of
retardation eﬀects.

In fact, ZJS also work in the dipole approximation, al-
though they validate their results by comparison with a
more general T-matrix solutions. The situation is some-
what more complicated, however, because ZJS use, in ad-
dition, an approximation proposed by Doyle in 1989 [5]
in the context of eﬀective-medium theory of the so-called
extended Maxwell-Garnett composites, i.e., composites
in which inclusions are not small compared to the wave-
length. More speciﬁcally, Doyle has studied electromag-
netic properties of a homogeneous host with randomly
distributed spherical inclusions. The essence of the ap-
proximation is to consider only dipole-dipole interactions
of the inclusions but to assign them dynamic dipole po-
larizability α. The latter is given by formula (2) below; it

is deﬁned as the linear coeﬃcient between the amplitude
of incident plane wave and the total dipole moment of
polarizable sphere of arbitrary size (assuming, the sphere
is isolated) and, in that sense, is exact. It can be seen
that the Doyle’s approach only concerns the choice of α
within the dipole approximation. Thus, it is fully consis-
tent with the general formalism developed in Ref. [2].

It should be noted that the accuracy and limits of ap-
plicability of the Doyle’s approximation have not been
systematically investigated.
In one critical study of
extended Maxwell-Garnett composites [6] Ruppin has
shown that the Doyle’s approximation is consistent with
the asymptotes obtained in the limit of small volume frac-
tion of inclusions, and, in that limit, allows one to con-
sider inclusions with size parameters of at least x
0.5.
Thus, the Doyle’s approximation can be useful for moder-
ate size parameters. However, if the spherical inclusions
are in close proximity of each other, the secondary scat-
tered waves incident upon each of them are no longer
plane waves. But the dynamic polarizability used by
Doyle is exact only with respect to incident plane waves.
Besides, coupling of higher multipole modes excited in
spherical inclusions can become signiﬁcant. Therefore, it
is quite obvious that the use of Doyle’a approximation
does not ﬁx, in principle, the deﬁciencies of the dipole
approximation.

The second statement concerns the possibility of
cancellation of the imaginary part of denominator in the
αS) (Eq. 5, or, in a more
expression P = αE0/(1
speciﬁc form, Eq. (7) of Ref. [1]). This is discussed on
p. 10874 of Ref. [1]. ZJS consider the case when the in-
cident wave vector is perpendicular to a linear chain of
polarizable dipoles with the period D. The polarization
of the incident wave is also perpendicular to the chain.
It is stated that the resonance width, which is related
in Ref. [1] to the imaginary part of the denominator of
8π3A/D3, where
the above equation, vanishes when γ
γ and A are parameters which specify the polarizabil-
ity of an isolated sphere. Namely, ZJS use the formula
α =
ωp + iγ), where ω is frequency of inci-
dent radiation, ωp is the surface plasmon frequency, and
γ - the relaxation parameter. Assuming that the result
8π3/D3, which is given in Ref. [1] for λ slightly
ImS =
larger than the interparticle distance D, is correct, one
immediately can see that the cancellation takes place ex-
actly at γ = 8π3A/D3. For smaller values of γ, the imag-
inary part of the denominator becomes, in fact, negative.
Such result clearly contradicts conservation of energy and
is unphysical. It was obtained in Ref. [1] due to several
mistakes which are discussed below.

Given the speciﬁc form α =
ωp + iγ), this ex-
pression diﬀers from Eq. (7) of Ref. [1] only by dividing
the numerator and denominator by the real constant A.
The quantity S here is the “dipole sum” - an eigenvalue
of the electromagnetic state of the dipole chain which is
excited by incident radiation. The imaginary part of the
denominator of (1) deﬁnes total relaxation.

Note that Im(1/α) can contain two contributions
which correspond to absorptive and radiative relaxation.
Both are strictly negative. On the other hand, imagi-
nary part of S has nothing to do with absorptive losses,
since S does not depend on material properties. Thus,
ImS can only inﬂuence radiative relaxation and can be
either positive or negative. In the ﬁrst case, the radia-
tive relaxation is increased compared to that of an iso-
lated sphere, while in the latter case it is reduced.
It
is important to note that 1/α and S satisfy the follow-
2k3/3 [7, 8] and
ing general inequalities: Im(1/α)
2k3/3 [9], where k = 2π/λ is the wavenumber.
ImS
Both inequalities follow from the very general considera-
tion of energy conservation. At the very least, they show
that the imaginary part of the denominator of Eq. (1)
can not become negative. The radiative relaxation is
2k3/3 (this possibility is discussed
canceled if ImS =
2k3/3, total relax-
below). If, in addition, Im(1/α) =
ation is equal to zero. Physically, this can not happen
due to small absorption which is always present even in
highly transparent materials, deviations from the dipole
approximation, etc.

16π3/3D3 and ImS

Let us re-write the above inequalities for λ

which is the situation considered in Ref. [1]. We obtain
16π3/3D3. The re-

sult adduced in Ref. [1], namely, ImS =
clearly contradicts the second inequality. This is due
to two reasons. First, it is incorrect that the far-ﬁeld
term Pj6=i(k2eikrij /rij ) dominates the dipole sum S for
D, as is stated in Ref. [1]. This would be only
λ
true for the real part of S. Second, even if only the far
ﬁeld term is used in the calculation of S, the result ad-
duced in Ref. [1] is oﬀ by the factor of 2. The correct
contribution to ImS which comes from the far-zone term
λ)]4π3/D3. The contribution which comes
is [sgn(D
from the intermediate-zone term is 2π3/3D3. The con-
tribution from the near-zone term is zero. Thus, we have
10π3/3D3 for D < λ and ImS = 14π3/3D3
ImS =

Next, we discuss the inequality Im(1/α)

2k3/3.
This inequality ensures that the dipole contribution to
the absorption cross section of a particle is not nega-
tive. It must hold even for nonabsorbing particles and,
in particular, for γ = 0.
In the case of a small parti-
cle, this inequality is satisﬁed if one uses the quasistatic
polarizability with the inclusion of the radiative reac-
tion correction: α = α(QS)/(1
2ik3α(QS)/3). Here
α is the polarizability with the radiative correction and
α(QS) = R3(ǫ
1)/(ǫ+ 2) is the quasistatic polarizability,
R being the sphere radius. The importance of the radia-
tive correction is discussed, for example, in Ref. [7], and
the authors of Ref. [1] are also aware of it (see Ref. [10],
Eqs. 16-18). The expression α =
ωp+iγ) used in
Ref. [1] does not contain the radiative correction. There-
fore, its use (together with an incorrect expression for S)
leads to unphysical results in the limit γ
0, such as the
total cancellation of relaxation or negative relaxation. It
should be also noted that the dynamic expression for α
which ZJS used in numerical simulations (according to
the Doyle’s approximation) also satisﬁes the above in-
equality. Indeed, if we take

The expansion beyond the third order contains only even
powers of k and it can be veriﬁed that each term in the
expansion is non-positive. The exact equality Im(1/α) =
2k3/3 takes place only for non-absorbing materials with

−
Imǫ = 0 (which do not occur in nature).

Finally, we discuss the possibility of exact cancellation
of the radiative relaxation. Note that (i) only the radia-
tive part of relaxation can be zero, (ii) the total relaxation
is always nonzero due to nonzero absorption, but can be-
come, in principle, arbitrarily small, and (iii) such can-
cellation can not take place in the geometry considered in
Ref. [1]. Generally, there can be two reasons for cancella-
tion of the radiative relaxation. The ﬁrst is symmetry [9].
Within the dipole approximation, the cancellation takes
place when the symmetry of a particular excitation mode
is such that dipole radiation is forbidden. A non-zero ra-
diative relaxation can still result from higher-multipole

radiation, similarly to non-zero decay rates of excited
atomic states whose decay is dipole-forbidden. The sec-
ond reason is when photon emission is prohibited by con-
servation laws, such as the light cone condition [11]. In
a linear chain of dipole-polarizable particles the cancel-

lation of radiative relaxation can take place when the
incident wave vector is parallel to the chain. However,
the radiative relaxation is always nonzero for normal in-
cidence.

1 Algebraic model

Recently, a symmetry-adapted version of the vibron model has been developed [1-
4]. The aim of this work is to present the description of all stretching and bending
vibrations of the methane molecule in the framework of such a model.

In the present algebraic approach a U(2) algebra is associated with each relevant
interatomic interaction. For the CH4 molecule we have four U(2) algebras correspond-
ing to the C-H interactions and six more representing the H-H couplings. The assign-
ments and the choice of the Cartesian coordinate system are the same as in []. The
molecular dynamical group is then given by the product U1(2) ⊗ . . . ⊗ U10(2), where
each Ui(2) algebra (i = 1, . . . , 10) is generated by the set { ˆGi} ≡ { ˆNi, ˆJ+,i, ˆJ−,i, ˆJ0,i},
which satisﬁes the commutation relations

[ ˆJ0,i, ˆJ±,i] = ± ˆJ±,i ,

[ ˆJ+,i, ˆJ−,i] = 2 ˆJ0,i ,

[ ˆNi, ˆJµ,i] = 0 ,

(1)

with µ = ±, 0. The labeling is such that i = 1, . . . , 4 correspond to the C-H couplings
while the other values of i are associated with H-H interactions []. Here ˆNi is the
i-th boson number operator. All physical operators are expressed in terms of the
generators { ˆGi}, and hence commute with the number operators ˆNi. Since ~J 2
i =
ˆNi( ˆNi + 2)/4 we can make the identiﬁcation ji = Ni/2. The eigenvalues of ˆJ0,i are
restricted to mi ≥ 0 and can have the values mi = Ni/2, (Ni − 2)/2, . . . , 1/2 or
0 for Ni odd or even, respectively []. The local basis states for each oscillator are
usually written as |Ni, vii, where vi = (Ni − 2mi)/2 = 0, 1, . . . [Ni/2] denotes the
number of oscillator quanta in the i-th oscillator. For the CH4 molecule there are
two diﬀerent boson numbers, Ns for the C-H couplings and Nb for the H-H couplings,
which correspond to the stretching and bending modes, respectively.

The symmetry of methane is taken into account by projecting the local operators
{ ˆGi}, which act on bond i, on the irreducible representations Γ of the tetrahedral

1

group Td. For the ˆJµ,i generators of Eq. (1) we obtain the Td tensors

ˆT Γx
µ,γ =

αΓx
γ,i

ˆJµ,i ,

i=1

where γ denotes the component of Γ, and the label x refers to stretching (s) or
bending (b). The explicit expressions for the tensors are similar to the one phonon
wave functions expansions given in []. The algebraic Hamiltonian is constructed by
repeated couplings of these tensors to a total symmetry A1.

The methane molecule has nine vibrational degrees of freedom. Four of them
correspond to the fundamental stretching modes (A1 ⊕ F2) and the other ﬁve to the
fundamental bending modes (E ⊕ F2) []. The projected tensors of Eq. (2) correspond
to ten degrees of freedom, four of which (A1 ⊕ F2) are related to stretching modes
A1,b
and six (A1 ⊕ E ⊕ F2) to the bendings. Consequently we can identify the tensor ˆT
µ,1
as the operator associated to a spurious mode. This identiﬁcation makes it possible
to eliminate the spurious states exactly. This can be achieved by (i) constructing the
physical Hamiltonian by simply ignoring the ˆT
tensor in the coupling procedure,
and (ii) diagonalizing this Hamiltonian in a symmetry-adapted basis from which the
spurious mode has been removed following the procedure of [].

A1,b
µ,1

According to the above procedure, we construct the Td invariant interactions that

are at most quadratic in the generators and conserve the total number of quanta

Here Γ = A1, F2 for the stretching vibrations x = s and Γ = E, F2 for the bending
vibrations x = b. In addition to Eq. (3), there are two stretching-bending interactions
which will not be considered at the moment.

The zeroth order vibrational Hamiltonian is then written as

ˆH0 = ω1 ˆHA1,s + ω2 ˆHEb + ω3 ˆHF2,s + ω4 ˆHF2,b
+α2 ˆVEb + α3 ˆVF2,s + α4 ˆVF2,b .

Γ( ˆHΓs + ˆVΓs)
The interaction ˆVA1,s has not been included since the combination
corresponds to the constant Ns + 2. A similar situation is present for the bending
interactions, but in this case the interaction ˆVA1,b has already been excluded in order
to remove the spurious A1 bending mode. The subscripts of the parameters corre-
spond to the (ν1, νl2
4 ) labeling of a set of basis states for the vibrational levels
of CH4. Here ν1, ν2, ν3 and ν4 denote the number of quanta in the A1,s, Eb, F2,s and
F2,b modes, respectively. The labels li are related to the vibrational angular momen-
tum associated with degenerate vibrations []. In the harmonic limit the interactions

of Eqs. (3) and (4) attain a particularly simple form, which can be directly related
to conﬁguration space interactions [1-4]. The ˆHΓx terms represent the anharmonic
counterpart of the harmonic interactions, while the ˆVΓx terms are purely anharmonic
contributions which vanish in the harmonic limit.

The zeroth order Hamiltonian of Eq. (4) is not suﬃcient to obtain a high-quality
ﬁt of the vibrations of methane. Several other physically meaningful interaction are
essential for such a ﬁt. For the study of the vibrational excitations of methane we
use the Td invariant Hamiltonian

The Xij terms are quadratic in the operators ˆHΓx and hence represent anharmonic
vibrational interactions. The gij terms are related to the vibrational angular momenta
associated with the degenerate vibrations [1-3].

In the harmonic limit the expectation value of the diagonal terms in Eq. (5) leads

to the familiar Dunham expansion [].

Here di is the degeneracy of the vibration. The tij terms in Eq. (5) give rise to further
splittings of the vibrational levels (ν1, ν2, ν3, ν4) into its possible sublevels []. Their
explicit expressions are given in ref. [2].

2 Results

The Hamiltonian of Eq. (5) involves 23 interaction strengths and the two boson
numbers, Ns and Nb. The vibron number associated with the stretching vibrations
is determined from the spectroscopic constants ωe and xeωe for the CH molecule to
be Ns = 43 []. The vibron number for the bending vibrations, which are far more
harmonic than the stretching vibrations, is taken to be Nb = 150. We have carried
out a least-square ﬁt to the vibrational spectrum of methane including 44 energies.
We ﬁnd an overall ﬁt to the observed levels with a r.m.s. deviation which is an order
of magnitude better than in previous studies. While the r.m.s. deviations of [] and []
are 12.16 and 11.61 cm−1 for 19 energies, we ﬁnd a r.m.s. of 1.16 cm−1 for 44 energies.

The values of the ﬁtted parameters as well as all predicted levels up to V = 3 are
given in ref. [1].

The α3 term is completely anharmonic in origin and has no counterpart in the
harmonic limit. In order to address the importance of this term in Eq. (5) we have
carried out another calculation without this term. With one less interaction term
the r.m.s. deviation increases from 1.16 to 4.48 cm−1. This shows the importance of
the term proportional to α3 to obtain an accurate description of the anharmonicities
that are present in the data. The absence of the α3 term in the second calculation
can only partially be compensated by the anharmonicity constants Xij [].

3 Conclusions

In summary, in this work we present the description of vibrational excitations of
methane in a symmetry-adapted algebraic model. We ﬁnd an overall ﬁt to the 44
observed levels with a r.m.s. deviation of 1.16 cm−1, which can be considered of
spectroscopic quality. We pointed out that the VF2,s term in combination with the
anharmonic eﬀects in the other interation terms plays a crucial role in obtaining a ﬁt
of this quality. Purely anharmonic terms of this sort arise naturally in the symmetry-
adapted algebraic model, but vanish in the harmonic limit. Physically, these con-
tributions arise from the anharmonic character of the interatomic interactions, and
seem to play an important role when dealing with molecular anharmonicities.

These studies suggest that the symmetry-adapted algebraic model provides a nu-
merically eﬃcient tool to study molecular vibrations with high precision. The main
diﬀerence with other algebraic methods is the use of symmetry-adapted tensors in
the construction of the Hamiltonian. In this approach, the interactions can be con-
structed in a systematic way, each term has a direct physical interpretation, and
spurious modes can be eliminated exactly.

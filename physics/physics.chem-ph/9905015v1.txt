Abstract

The symmetrized contribution of E-type spin-rotation interaction to conver-

sion between spin modiﬁcations of E- and A1-types in molecules with C3v-

symmetry is considered. Using the high-J descending of collisional broad-

ening for accidental rotational resonances between these spin modiﬁcations,

it was possible to co-ordinate the theoretical description of the conversion

with (updated) experimental data for two carbon-substituted isotopes of ﬂu-

oromethane. As a result, both E-type spin-rotation constants are obtained.

They are roughly one and a half times more than the corresponding constants

for (deutero)methane.

I. INTRODUCTION

The purpose of the present work is to compare the theoretical description of spin-

modiﬁcation (or, diﬀerently, spin-isomer) conversion [1,2] with updated experimental data

for two carbon-substituted isotopes of ﬂuoromethane [3–5]. The main diﬃculties on this

way are conditioned, ﬁrstly, by the lack of data about E-type1 spin-rotation constants of

this molecule and, secondly, by the insuﬃciently reliable data about values and collisional

broadenings of conversional accidental resonances of rotational levels of its spin modiﬁca-

tions. Resigning oneself to the latter, we attempt to extract at least preliminary information

on this constants by reversing the problem on the conversional contribution of spin-rotation

interaction. It is useful to compare the obtained constants for ﬂuoromethane with the known

ones for methane presenting them in the similarly orientated molecule-ﬁxed frames.

In the beginning, it is necessary to make two corrections.2 The consideration of spin-

modiﬁcation conversion for C3v-symmetry molecules in [2] explores the spin-rotation Hamil-

tonian form of limited applicability. Being widely encountered in papers and books (see,

e.g., [7,8]), this form is non-Hermitian for nonspherical tops of nonlinear molecules. It is nec-

essary to use the standard symmetrizing procedure [9] in order to come to Hermitian form

of the Hamiltonian. The second correction deals with the contribution of Thomas precession

to the spin-rotation constants [10]. As the most important consequence, the components of

these tensorial constants even in R-forms (7) may have asymmetry, i.e., transposed matrices

RRRς⊤

= RRRς for oﬀ-axial nuclei. The number of independent components of R-form (10) may

grow up to ﬁve, i.e., two of A1-type and three (but not two as in [2]) of E-type.

The two carbon-substituted isotopes of ﬂuoromethane (12,13CH3F) in the room-temp-

erature gaseous phase have essentially diﬀerent rates of mutual conversion of para- and

ortho-modiﬁcation. According to [3–5,11], the updated pressure-normalized rates of spin-

It may be compared with the P -normalized collisional broadening (halfwidth) of rotational

13γ(P ) = 1942(95) µHz/Torr.

where

ΓJ ′K ′/JK = (ΓJ ′K ′ + ΓJK)/2.

(3)

According to [12], we have

Γ(P )
5,3/4,3 = 15.2(8) MHz/Torr.

The theoretical estimates of nuclear spin-spin contribution to γ(P ) were obtained in [1]

assuming the same broadening for all the conversional transitions. These estimates make up

7% of (1) for 12CH3F and 43% of (2) for 13CH3F. But this simple assumption leads to an

incompatibility between (1) and (2), if, following [2], one attempts to add the spin-rotation

contribution to the spin-spin one. The rejection of the last high-J para-ortho resonance

standing out against the rest for 12CH3F might be a possible way out of this situation. The

reason for that has been found in [13].

It turned out that the collisional broadening of

rotational lines is decreased with increasing J. As a result, the contribution of the high-J

resonance is eﬀectively suppressed and the indicated incompatibility is eliminated.

It make sense to collect together all spin-rotation constants of ﬂuoromethane and

(deutero)methane. Further, comparing them, we can make the deﬁnite conclusion on signs

of the E-type constants for ﬂuoromethane.

3In this paper all the rates (or frequencies) are angular but measured in Hz = 2π s−1.

II. SYMMETRIZED FORM OF SPIN-ROTATION HAMILTONIAN

The spin-rotation interaction appears as a consequence of action of a local magnetic ﬁeld

ˆBς on the magnetic moment ˆµς

I is
the nuclear g-factor, µN is the nuclear magneton, and ˆI ς is the nuclear spin undimensioned
by Planck’s constant ~. The intramolecular ﬁeld ˆBς is conditioned by rotation of nuclear

ˆI ς of nucleus labelled by ς. Here µς

where ˆBς = ˆJ

CCCς is spin-rotation tensor. The energy (as well as CCCς) is measured in frequency units. The

CCCς/µς

convenient unit of measurement for CCCς usually is kHz. In molecule-ﬁx frame4 the components

of CCCς are constant but [ ˆJi, ˆI ς

the case of the SO3 group, we have [κ] = 2κ +1. Just this form of spin-rotation Hamiltonian

is used in analitical calculations (cp. with [2]). It is necessary to note directly now, that the

non-commutation of ˆJi and ˆI ς

j has a little signiﬁcance at high J. We shall see this situation

does take place for ﬂuoromethane.

III. ISOTOPICALLY INDEPENDENT SPIN-ROTATION CONSTANTS

In order that the spin-rotation constants do not change with isotopical substitutions, it

is convenient to use their modiﬁed R-form, i.e., let

CCCς = gς
I

˜BBB

RRRς.

·

Here ˜BBB = 2BBB = ~III−1, i.e. proportional to the inverse tensor of inertia moment localized (as

well as ˆJ ) in inertia center. The factor ~ is chosen for ˜BBB to have frequency dimensions as

well as CCCς. The tensor BBB is deﬁned by rotational spectrum of molecule (16). Choosing the

molecule-ﬁx frame with its z-axis along the axis of molecular symmetry (C

F) we obtain

the diagonal

For isotopes 12,13CH3F we have transverse components 12 ˜B⊥ = 51.1(1) GHz and 13 ˜B⊥ =

49.7(1) GHz, both longitudinal ones 12,13 ˜Bz = 310.7(1) GHz. The non-dimensional tensor
RRRς is only deﬁned by electric charge distribution. It is one and the same for all the isotopes

of molecule in their invariable geometry. Another attractive property of RRRς is much greater

symmetry in comparison with CCCς, i.e., we may have RRRς

atom, i.e. the diﬀerence of nuclear magnetic shielding for

nucleus ς by forming the molecule from free atoms. Thus, it is convenient to measure

R-constants in ppb = 10−9, i.e. parts per billion, as well as σ-constants in ppm = 10−6.

Some (most likely small) asymmetry of tensor RRRς may be for oﬀ-axial spins by taking

into account the Thomas correction dependent on motion of spinning nuclei [10]. We are

going to neglect this asymmetry for ﬂuoromethane, having in view of the zero asymmetric

part and small contribution of the Thomas correction in the symmetric one [16] for methane

used here as a sample.

Now let us devide, as in [2], all the nuclei ς into axial (vertical) v = F, C and oﬀ-axial

(horizontal) h = H1, H2, H3. The use of the C3v-symmetry group for oﬀ-axial nucleus H1

drift method [17], we can breakdown the equilibrium. Owing to the mutual conversion,

the non-equilibrium populations decay. This decay is described with one exponent, i.e.,

δρI H(t) = δρI H(0)e−γt and

I H δρI H(t) = 0. Let us consider now the expression for the

VI. COMPARISON OF SPIN-ROTATION CONSTANTS OF FLUOROMETHANE

AND (DEUTERO)METHANE

Here the conversional spin-rotation constants of ﬂuoromethane are found for the ﬁrst

time. To compare them with known respective constants of methane (or deuteromethane),

we must equally orientate both molecules so that F of CH3F corresponds to H4 of CH3H

(or D of CH3D). The spin-rotation constants of CH4 are usually cited in the following form

VII. CONCLUSION

Summing up, we notice the following. Unlike [2], the symmetrized spin-rotation contribu-

tion to nuclear spin-modiﬁcation conversion in C3v-symmetry molecules has been produced.

But the symmetrization is important only for low J.

Both conversional spin-rotation constants RHE

⊥ and RHE

(+)z obtained here for ﬂuorometh-

ane are roughly one and half times more than the respective constants of (deutero)meth-

ane. This diﬀerence in reality is slightly less even because to estimate the conversional

rate we have taken into account only the most sharp accidental resonances, i.e. the most

coupled rotational levels of nuclear spin modiﬁcations. There is a more complete set7 of

these resonances with J

80 in [11].

≤

The degree of asymmetry for spin-rotation tensor RRRh still remains unclear. The asym-

metry of RRRh is absent for methane because of suﬃciently high Td-symmetry. But we have
only supposed the antisymmetric term RRRh

(−) to be zero for ﬂuoromethane.

The constant RHE

⊥ in contrast to both RHE

(±)z manifests itself in spectra as hyperﬁne

doubling of rotational levels with K = 1 [27,7]. One can ﬁnd it, e.g., using the magnetoﬁeld

spectrum of nonlinear-optical resonance [2]. More promising alternative way of ﬁnding

all the three conversional spin-rotation constants was described by authors of [28]. They

had suggested to measure the nuclear spin conversion of ﬂuoromethane in the presence of

electric ﬁeld. The Stark-induced crossings of rotational levels would allow to disentangle the

conversional spin-rotation and spin-spin contributions. The spin-spin contribution can be

used as a scale to measure the spin-rotation one in this method. The last circumstance is

especially attractive since it allows to remove the problems connected with the broadening

of accidental resonances.

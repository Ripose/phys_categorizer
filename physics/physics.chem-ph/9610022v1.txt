II. INTRODUCTION

Stockmayer ﬂuids1 have long been studied as models
for ﬂuids with permanent dipoles, such as water, ammo-
nia, or methyl chloride. Thermodynamic properties for
these ﬂuids have been calculated by theory and simu-
lations. Attempts have been made to model real dipo-
lar ﬂuids by ﬁtting potential parameters of Stockmayer
ﬂuids. Rowlinson2 ﬁtted experimental second virial co-
eﬃcients to theoretically calculated ones to ﬁnd Stock-
mayer potential parameters ǫ, σ, and
for some dipo-
lar ﬂuids. Van Leeuwen3 ﬁtted experimental coexistence
curves to results from computer simulations. Agreement
between the Stockmayer potential parameters calculated
from second virial coeﬃcients and phase coexistence data
is only qualitative. One of the reasons why the agreement
is not quantitative is that ﬁtting of the second virial co-
eﬃcient gives the parameters for the ﬂuid at the limit of
zero density while ﬁtting of the coexistence curve gives
the parameters for the dense ﬂuid. The interaction of
dipolar molecules can signiﬁcantly change depending on
the density or temperature due to the redistribution of
electron density within a molecule in response to changes
in the molecular environment (electrostatic induction ef-
fect). It is essential to account for this eﬀect when phase
coexistence properties of dipolar ﬂuids are calculated be-
cause electrostatic induction is much stronger in the liq-
uid phase than in the gas phase, and molecular interac-
tions cannot be accurately modeled by the same (non-

polarizable) model and parameters for both phases. One
way to include the electrostatic induction eﬀect on a
model of polar ﬂuids is to introduce polarizability.

Wertheim4 has studied the eﬀect of polarizability on
thermodynamic properties by using a graph-theoretical
approach. His renormalization perturbation theory5 was
then extended to mixtures by Venkatasubramanian et
al.6. Patey et al.7 performed Monte Carlo simulations
to test the free energy calculation by Wertheim’s theory
for hard spheres with moderately large reduced dipoles
m∗
/√kT d3 = 1.0 (where m0 is the perma-
0|

nent dipole moment) and reduced mean polarizabilities
of α∗ = α/d3 = 0.03, 0.06, 0.1 (where k is Boltzmann
constant, T is the absolute temperature, d is the hard
sphere diameter and α is polarizability). Venkatasubra-
manian et al. compared theoretically calculated coexis-
tence properties with experiment6 for Stockmayer ﬂuids

1.0 and
with reduced dipoles of

|
reduced polarizabilities of α∗ = α/σ3
0.06 (ǫ and
σ are the Lennard-Jones parameters). The results of
these studies agree reasonably well with Wertheim’s the-
ory. Vesely8 performed molecular dynamics simulations
of polarizable Stockmayer ﬂuids and calculated the eﬀect
of polarizability on thermodynamic properties such as in-
ternal energy or pressure. Smit et al.9 and van Leeuwen
et al.10 performed Gibbs ensemble Monte Carlo simula-
tions of coexistence properties for non-polarizable Stock-
mayer ﬂuids. However, simulation studies of the coex-
istence properties of polarizable Stockmayer ﬂuids have
not been previously published to our knowledge.

In this paper, we present results from Grand Canoni-
cal Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations of Stockmayer ﬂu-
ids with and without polarizability for the vapor- liq-
uid phase coexistence properties. The results are com-
pared to the renormalization perturbation theory by
Wertheim5,6. We study the models with reduced dipoles
of
= 1.0 and 2.0 and reduced polarizabilities of
α∗ =0.00, 0.03, and 0.06. Examples of estimates of the
= 1.84 and α∗ =0.08
parameters for real ﬂuids are
= 1.03 and α∗ =0.06 for methyl
for water2 and
chloride6. Since applications of the histogram reweight-
ing method to phase coexistence of ﬂuids have only re-
cently started appearing16, we begin this paper by dis-
cussing the principle of the method and issues related
to its practical application to predict phase coexistence
curves at temperatures signiﬁcantly below the critical
point.

III. GCMC HISTOGRAM REWEIGHTING
METHOD

Determination of phase coexistence by Monte Carlo
simulation requires either implicit or explicit calculation
of the free energy of a system. The Gibbs ensemble
method11 is used for determination of phase equilibrium
by implicitly minimizing the total free energy of the sys-
tem, which is separated into two phases. Non-Boltzmann
sampling methods (such as thermodynamic scaling)12,13
and the test particle insertion method14 are among the
methods for explicit calculation of free energy of the sys-
tem. Ferrenberg and Swendsen15 proposed the use of the
distribution of energy and density calculated in grand
canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations. We refer
to this method as “the histogram reweighting method.”
The method has rarely been applied to continuous-space
ﬂuids, with the exception of a recent study by Wilding
for the Lennard-Jones ﬂuid16. We chose the histogram
reweighting method for this study because we found it to
be computationally more eﬃcient than the other avail-
able methods for our systems.

One of

the attractive features of the histogram
reweighting method is that it can be used to construct
the grand canonical partition function, which in turn can
be used to obtain all thermodynamic properties, includ-
ing the free energy or coexistence properties. Moreover,
a single simulation at a given chemical potential µ and
temperature T can give the thermodynamic properties at
a range of µ′ and T ′, by virtue of the scaling properties
in the variables (see section on ”Theoretical Basis” be-
low). In calculating coexistence properties, it is not nec-
essary to observe phase coexistence in a single GCMC
simulation, since they are calculated by analyzing the
grand canonical partition function constructed by com-
bining the histograms. GCMC simulation is appropriate
for calculating thermodynamic properties for a range of
densities for molecular ﬂuids, because it does not require
computationally expensive volume changes. The polar-
izable Stockmayer potential does not scale simply with
volume.

A. Theoretical Basis

The basic concept behind the histogram reweighting
method of Ferrenberg and Swendsen15 for GCMC simu-
lations is reviewed here. The grand canonical partition
function of a system with chemical potential µ, volume
V , and temperature T is written as

Ξ(µ, V, T ) =

exp[(N βµ)

βUN ]Ω(N, V, UN ) (1)

X
N

X
UN

−

where Ω(N, V, UN ) is the number of microstates for num-
ber of particles N , volume V and energy UN ; the nota-
tion UN emphasizes that the energy level depends on the
number of particles. We deﬁne the chemical potential µ
by

βµ = ln z

(2)

where z is the activity. β is the inverse temperature
(β = 1/kT ) , where k is Boltzmann’s constant. The

X

and

UN

denotes the summation over all energy levels for

each N . We perform GCMC simulations by Norman and
Filinov’s method17 and store the number of observations
of particular N and UN in a two dimensional histogram
fµ,V,T (N, UN ), which is related to the components of the
grand canonical partition function, with a simulation-
speciﬁc constant C, by

fµ,V,T (N, UN )

seen from these equations, once we know the components
of the grand canonical partition function fµ,V,T (N, UN )
at a thermodynamic state (µ, V , T ), we can construct
a grand canonical partition function at a diﬀerent ther-
modynamic state (µ′, V , T ′) by reweighting each com-
ponent with exp[N (β′µ′
β)UN ]. Then, we
βµ)
can calculate the thermodynamic properties at the new
state (µ′, V , T ′) by averaging a thermodynamic variable
with the reweighted components of the grand canonical
partition function. Therefore, once we have a two dimen-
sional histogram fµ,V,T (N, UN ) from a GCMC simulation
at a state (µ, V , T ), any thermodynamic property at any
state (µ′, V , T ′). The constant C, which is unknown, but
can be determined as described below, is unimportant in
averaging a property X as in equation 6 because it can-
cels out in the numerator and the denominator.

B. Determination of phase coexistence

In the grand canonical ensemble at a sub-critical tem-
perature, the vapor-liquid coexistence can be determined
by ﬁnding the chemical potential that gives the same
pressure for both phases. We deﬁne the pressure P at
a thermodynamic state (µ, V , T ) by

Pµ,V,T =

ln Ξ(µ, V, T )

(7)

If a histogram is made for a thermodynamic state (µ, V ,
T ), the pressure at (µ′, V , T ′) is calculated by

where equations 5 and 7 are used. At a subcritical tem-
perature, the pressure of each phase is thus calculated ex-
cept for the constant C. The chemical potential µ′ that
gives the same pressure for both phases is then found,
and the phase coexistence thus determined. When it is
necessary to calculate the absolute value of the partition
function, the simulation speciﬁc constant C needs to be
determined by a diﬀerent means. In this study, the ab-
solute value of the constant C is ﬁxed by calculating the
pressure in the original simulation using the virial theo-
rem

and equating that with the pressure calculated by equa-
tion 8.

C. Combining Results of Several Simulations

Calculation of the thermodynamic properties at vapor-
liquid coexistence requires the histogram over a wide
range of N and UN . However,
it is diﬃcult to get
fµ,V,T (N, UN ) with good statistical accuracy over a wide
range of N and UN from one simulation. In the method
by Norman and Filinov17 or in any Metropolis scheme18,
the conﬁgurations relevant to the given thermodynamic
state (µ, V , T ) are preferentially sampled and those rele-
vant to other states are not sampled well. Therefore, we
perform several simulations at diﬀerent thermodynamic
states and combine the information to construct the his-
togram fµ,V,T (N, UN ), which is then given with good ac-
curacy over a wide range of N and UN .
In the initial
attempts to sample a wide range of N and UN , we per-
form GCMC simulations at a temperature slightly above
the critical point with various chemical potentials. The
details are described in section 5.

Combining two simulation results is done by ﬁxing the
ratio of the simulation speciﬁc constants C for two sim-
ulations at diﬀerent thermodynamic states (denoted by
subscripts 1 and 2) by imposing

at the same N and T : if the original simulations are per-
formed at diﬀerent temperatures, one or both histograms
need to be reweighted so that the two histograms are
compared at the same temperature.
It is necessary to
choose N and T for which the relevant conﬁgurations
are sampled by both simulations. For convenience, we
choose T as the average of the temperatures for the two
original simulations and N as the number of particles at
which the density distributions at temperature T overlap
most. A more sophisticated way of combining multiple
simulation results, utilizing information for a range of N
instead of one N , has been proposed by Ferrenberg and
Swendsen19. The simpler method described above was
found to be satisfactory for our systems.

D. Comparison to the Gibbs Ensemble method

Both the GCMC histogram reweighting method and
the Gibbs ensemble method11 can be used to obtain the
coexistence properties of a system such as the polariz-
able Stockmayer ﬂuid of the present study. At ﬁrst sight,
it would seem that the Gibbs ensemble method is sim-
pler to implement, as it requires only a single simula-
tion per temperature at which coexistence is to be deter-
mined, rather than the series of simulations required by

3

the GCMC histogram method. To determine the com-
plete phase diagram at a series of temperatures both
methods require several simulations. However, we have
found that statistical uncertainties for the coexistence
properties from the GCMC method seem to be signiﬁ-
cantly smaller than for a Gibbs-ensemble determination
of the phase behavior for comparable amounts of compu-
tational time expenditure. This statement is supported
by the small statistical uncertainties of the coexistence
properties calculated in Tables III and IV, which would
have required prohibitively long Gibbs ensemble calcula-
tions.

IV. MODEL

A molecule of a Stockmayer ﬂuid is a Lennard-Jones
interaction site with an embedded point dipole at the
center of the molecule. For polarizable models, polariz-
ability is introduced also at the center of the molecule7,8.
Assuming that the induced dipole moment is linearly de-
pendent on the local electric ﬁeld at the center of the
molecule, the total dipole moment of molecule i is writ-
ten as

mi = m0,i + α

Ei,

·

where mi is the total dipole moment, m0,i is the perma-
nent dipole moment, Ei is the local electric ﬁeld at the
center of the molecule, and α is the polarizability tensor.
The local electric ﬁeld is calculated as20

Ei =

T ij

mj,

·

X
j6=i

where T ij is the dipole tensor for molecules i and j. If
the vector connecting the centers of molecules i and j
is written as rij and the unit tensor as I ij, the dipole
tensor is deﬁned as

T ij =

3rijrij

The total interaction of a Stockmayer ﬂuid is U = ULJ +
Udp , where

rij =

(11)

(12)

(13)

In these equations, ULJ and Udp denote the Lennard-
Jones interaction and the dipole-dipole interaction, re-
spectively. ǫ and σ are the Lennard-Jones parameters.
Since the total dipole mement of each molecule depends
on the dipole moments of other molecules, the energy
is calculated by an iterative procedure. Details of the
iterative procedure are discussed in the next section.

V. SIMULATION DETAILS

Throughout this study, data are presented in the re-
duced units, denoted by the superscript (*). The units
of energy and length are reduced by the Lennard-Jones
parameters ǫ and σ, respectively. Reduced temperature
is T ∗ = kT /ǫ. Dipole moment (m) and polarizabil-
ity (α) are reduced by the Lennard-Jones parameters as
m∗ = m/√ǫσ3 and α∗ = α/σ3. We study Stockmayer
ﬂuids with permanent dipole moments
= 1.0 and
2.0 and isotropic polarizabilities α∗ = 0.00, 0.03, and
0.06.

In GCMC simulations, at each Monte Carlo step, a
new microstate is generated by a displacement, rotation,
and creation or destruction of a molecule. The state thus
generated is probabilistically accepted so that the limit-
ing distribution of generated microstates obeys the grand
canonical ensemble. We use 10% of the Monte Carlo
moves for displacement, 10% for rotation, 40% for cre-
ation, and 40% for destruction. In the energy calculation
of polarizable models, the total interaction of the system
is calculated by an iterative procedure7,8,21 described be-
low.

The initial values of properties for a conﬁguration are
indicated by (0), and the estimates for those properties at
the k-th iteration by (k). When a molecule is either dis-
placed, rotated, created or destroyed, the initial estimate
of the electric ﬁeld at the center of molecule i is

Ei(1) =

Then, the ﬁrst estimate of the total dipole mement of
molecule i is

respectively. This procedure is repeated until Udp(k) is
converged so that
<

0.0001 for two consecutive iterations. Typically, the num-
ber of iterations required for this criterion at each Monte
Carlo move turns out to be 3 to 4 for polarizability of
α∗ = 0.03 and 3 to 6 for α∗ = 0.06 (see tables 1 and 2).
The initial value of dipole moment of molecule i(mi(0))
at each Monte Carlo step is chosen to be the dipole
moment before the move, except for a newly inserted
molecule for which the dipole moment is chosen to be the
same as the permanent dipole moment. The dipole points
to a random direction for a newly inserted molecule. In
order to minimize the size eﬀect for the dipole-dipole in-
teraction, we use the Ewald sum with 256 vectors for
the reciprocal space terms22 for the model with
=
1.0 and α∗ = 0.00, and 514 vectors for the other models
that we study. Approximate overall cpu-time per Monte
Carlo step for the polarizable models is 2 times slower for
α∗ = 0.03 and 2.4 times slower for α∗ = 0.06 than the
cpu-time for α∗ = 0.00 by our code designed for polar-
izable models with the Ewald sum. Simulations of non-
polarizable models by our code for polarizable models
are, in turn, approximately 4 times slower than those by
our code speciﬁcally designed for non-polarizable mod-
els, because the energy calculation of polarizable models
requires the calculation of the local electric ﬁeld of each
molecule.

When two polarizable molecules approach unphysically
close to each other during simulation, the electrostatic
attraction increases faster than the repulsive part of the
Lennard-Jones potential due to the increasing magnitude
of the total dipoles and eventually the two molecules
overlap21.
In order to avoid this eﬀect, we set a satu-
ration point of the total dipole equal to twice the mag-
nitude of the permanent dipole. This treatment seems
to be reasonable because the average of the total dipole
moment is far smaller than twice the magnitude of the
permanent dipole in each of the simulations we performed
(see tables 1 and 2). For the Lennard-Jones interaction,
the potential is cut oﬀ at half of the simulation box length
and the standard long range correction is applied23.

During the simulations, the number of observations of
a given number of particles and energy is counted and
the two dimensional histogram fµ,V,T (N, UN ) is made.
The grid of the histogram for energy is chosen to be 0.01
in the reduced unit. The two dimensional histograms of
the number of particles and the energy are analyzed to
obtain coexistence properties for a range of temperature
by the method described in section 2.

In most simulations, the volume is chosen to be
V ∗=216. For simulations of low densities, the volume
is chosen to be V ∗=2160 so that the simulation box can
accommodate a large enough number of particles to mea-
sure a density diﬀerence as small as ∆ρ∗ = ∆[1/V ∗]
≃
In combining the histograms of simulations of

diﬀerent volumes, we rescale the histogram for V ∗=2160
to that for V ∗=216 assuming

Ω(N, V, T ) = Ω(kN, kV, T )

k ,

(21)

or, in terms of the component of the histogram,

fµ,V,T (N, UN ) = fµ,kV,T (kN, UkN )

(22)

1
k

which is a reasonable assumption away from the criti-
cal point, since the logarithms of the microcanonical and
canonical partition functions are extensive properties of
the system.

To ﬁx the simulation speciﬁc constant C, we use the
pressure calculated by the virial theorem in one of the
simulations in the gas phase. The derivative of energy in
terms of volume is calculated by an approximation,

dU
dV ≃

U (V + δV )
δV

−

U (V )

.

(23)

The δV is chosen to be about 3% of the volume V . The
energy U (V +δV ) is calculated every time a Monte Carlo
move is accepted.

For each model, we ﬁrst estimate the approximate loca-
tion of the critical point by looking up literature values
for similar models9,10 and by performing several short
test simulations. Then, we perform a series of GCMC
simulations at a temperature slightly above the critical
temperature for various chemical potentials to sample a
wide range of density. The reasons why we choose a tem-
perature slightly above the critical temperature are that
large density ﬂuctuations near the critical point make it
easier to sample a wide range of density in a single sim-
ulation and that for subcritical temperatures the system
tends to ﬂuctuate infrequently between the gas and liquid
densities, making sampling of both phases diﬃcult.

formed GCMC simulations with various chemical poten-
tials (µ∗ =

interest. The mean densities calculated from these simu-
lations are shown in ﬁgure 1 by circles. The coexistence
properties for a range of temperatures (T ∗ = 1.0

for this example) are calculated from these simulation
results.

In order to make sure that the simulations are sam-
pling the conﬁgurations relevant to the phase equilibrium
properties, we performed a new series of simulations with
temperatures and chemical potentials that are near the
corresponding properties at phase coexistence for tem-
peratures lower than the temperature for the ﬁrst simula-
tions (T ∗=1.0, 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3). The chemical potentials
for these simulations are chosen to be the values at co-
existence estimated from the ﬁrst simulation results for
each temperature. The mean densities calculated from
the new series of GCMC simulations are shown in ﬁgure
1 by squares.

The histograms obtained from the new series of sim-
ulations (below the critical point) and four of the ﬁrst
simulations (near the critical point) were analyzed to

5

calculate the phase coexistence properties. The distribu-
tions of density from the histograms used for analysis are
shown in ﬁgure 2 and the conditions of the simulations
are listed in table 1. The ﬁtting of the calculated coexis-
tence densities to the law of rectilinear diameters and a
scaling law, assuming that dipolar ﬂuids obey the Ising
exponent (β = 0.326), is shown in ﬁgure 1 by dashed
line. We performed ﬁve sets of simulations and analy-
ses. The length of each GCMC simulation was 1 million
Monte Carlo steps. The averages and the error-bars were
calculated from the ﬁve sets of data. For error-bars, we
use the square root of the variance of mean. Thus cal-
culated error-bars are not, in a strict sense, statistical
errors because there are several sources of statistical er-
rors that propagate to the ﬁnal results: for example, the
thermodynamic states of interest here are not sampled an
exactly equal number of times in the simulations. How-
ever, they are still good estimates of the reliability of the
simulations and the data analysis.

As we can see in ﬁgure 1, the mean densities of the
second series of simulations (squares) agree well with
the ﬁnal results (dashed line). Since the chemical po-
tentials in the second series of simulations are based
on the estimates from the ﬁrst simulations (circles), it
turns out that the estimates of coexistence densities from
the ﬁrst simulations are fairly accurate, considering that
all the simulations were performed at one temperature
(T ∗ = 1.5).

VI. RESULTS

The magnitude of the average total dipole moment and
the number of iterations necessary for the convergence of
the energy calculation, with the criterion given in the pre-
vious section, are listed for polarizable models along with
the conditions used for the original GCMC simulations

for energy calculation turns out to be 3 to 6, depending
on the models and the thermodynamic states. The cal-
culated magnitude of the induced dipole is larger for the

two peaks start to overlap. The results are shown in
ﬁgures 4 to 9, and tables 3, 4 and 5. The critical temper-
ature increases for the models of higher dipole moment
and higher polarizability. The heat of vaporization is cal-
culated from the results of internal energy, pressure, and
density at coexistence.

We estimate the approximate values of the inﬁnite-
system critical temperature and density by ﬁtting the
simulation results to the law of rectilinear diameters and
a scaling law, assuming that dipolar ﬂuids obey the Ising
exponent (β = 0.326). Finite-size scaling methods16 can
be used to locate the critical point with a much higher
accuracy than the present study, but require a series of
simulations for diﬀerent system sizes. The critical tem-
perature increases as the polarizability increases for both

= 1.0 and 2.0) that we studied (see table
dipoles (

5). The eﬀect of polarizability on the critical density is
not pronounced. Our results seem to indicate a slight
increase in the critical density at higher polarizabilities,
but the diﬀerences are comparable to the statistical un-
certainties of the calculations.

The calculated coexistence density, pressure, and heat
of vaporization are compared with the renormalization
perturbation theory by Wertheim ﬁgures 4 to 9. For the
theoretical calculation, we follow the prescription given
by Venkatasubramanian et al.6 and use the equation of
state by Johnson et al.24 and the coeﬃcients of the pair
and triplet correlation functions calculated by Flytzani-
Stephanopoulos et al.25 and Gubbins and Twu26 for the
Lennard-Jones reference ﬂuid. The agreement between
simulation and theory is relatively good for
= 1.0,
but poor for
= 2.0. Statistical uncertainties of the
results are quite small, conﬁrming the computational ad-
vantages of the histogram reweighting method.

VII. CONCLUSIONS

We have calculated the phase coexistence properties
of polarizable and non-polarizable Stockmayer ﬂuids by
the GCMC histogram reweighting method.
In the his-
togram reweighting method, the grand canonical parti-
tion function of the system is constructed, from which
any thermodynamic property can be derived by statisti-
cal thermodynamic analysis. Since the thermodynamic
state for the grand canonical partition function can be
continuously changed by “reweighting” the histograms,
thermodynamic properties at thermodynamic states that
are diﬀerent from the thermodynamic state of the original
simulation can be calculated. The statistical uncertain-
ties of the calculated results are small, conﬁrming the
computational advantages of the histogram reweighting
method over existing methods (such as Gibbs ensemble
Monte Carlo11).

Our results for the coexistence properties were com-
pared to Wertheim’s renormalization perturbation the-
ory. Diﬀerences between theoretical and simulation re-

FIG. 1. Temperature and mean density of example GCMC
simulations. The initial simulations are performed to cover a
wide range of density at a temperature slightly higher than
the estimated critical point (T ∗

tials of µ∗=-7.00, -6.00, -5.00, -4.20, -4.00, -3.90, -3.72, -3.00,
-2.00, and -1.00 (circles, from left to right). The second series
of simulations are performed at temperatures and chemical
potentials for phase coexistence (squares, see also table 1),
as calculated from the initial simulations. Dashed line is the
ﬁtting of the coexistence curve to the results from the second
series of simulations.

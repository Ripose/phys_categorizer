The ground and excited state properties of small helium clusters, 4HeN , con-
taining nanoscale (∼3–10 ˚A) planar aromatic molecules have been studied
with quantum Monte Carlo methods. Ground state structures and energies
are obtained from importance-sampled, rigid-body diﬀusion Monte Carlo.
Excited state energies due to helium vibrational motion are evaluated us-
ing the projection operator, imaginary time spectral evolution technique. We
examine the adsorption of N helium atoms (N ≤ 24) on a series of planar
aromatic molecules (benzene, naphthalene, anthracene, tetracene, phthalo-
cyanine). The ﬁrst layer of helium atoms is well-localized on the molecule
surface, and we ﬁnd well-deﬁned localized excitations due to in-plane vibra-
tional motion of helium on the molecule surface. We discuss the implications
of these conﬁned excitations for the molecule spectroscopy.

INTRODUCTION

The utility of He II as a gentle, quantum matrix for the high-resolution
spectroscopic study of impurity molecules is now well-established. 1 Accom-
panying these recent developments in experimental methodology is an in-
terest in examining the spectroscopy of large, planar aromatic molecules
(PAM) in helium. These PAMs can be viewed as nanoscale precursors to
bulk graphite surfaces, whose size and geometry can be systematically tuned.
The experiments have examined the electronic spectra of the molecules, and
can be divided into two general classes: a) those involving small numbers of
helium atoms (N ≤ 17) around the impurity molecule, and b) those where
the PAM is embedded in a large helium droplet (N ∼ 10000).

P. Huang, H. D. Whitley, and K. B. Whaley

The electronic spectra of PAMs in helium exhibit features not found for
the corresponding bare molecules. These new features are presumably due
to the presence of helium on the molecule surface, but a more speciﬁc under-
standing of their origins does not yet exist. In the absorption experiments,
sharp excitations have been observed at ∼ 3 − 30 K above the electronic ori-
gin, which have been qualitatively attributed to the localized vibrations of
helium atoms adsorbed on the molecule surface. 2,3,4 This energy range also
encompasses the band of states (phonon wings) associated with collective
compressional excitations of the cluster interior, 5 and in the large cluster
experiments these localized excitations appear as additional structure su-
perimposed on the phonon wing sidebands.

For the electronic spectra of a number of diﬀerent PAMs (tetracene,
Mg-phthalocyanine, and various indole derivatives) in large He droplets, the
peak associated with the electronic origin (zero-phonon line) also exhibits
additional structure, with splittings on the order of ∼ 1.5 K. 6,7 These split-
tings are not observed in the small cluster experiments, 3 and their physical
origins are not completely understood at this point. One possibility is that
they are due to the excitation of low-energy modes involving the collective
motion of helium atoms on the molecule surface. Theoretical calculations for
the HeN -benzene cluster suggest that individual helium atoms are strongly
localized on the molecule surface. 8,9 As we discuss further below, this is a
general feature which we ﬁnd for a number of other PAMs, so another pos-
sible explanation is that these splittings do not arise from elastic transitions
at all, but are instead due to inhomogeneities in the local helium environ-
ment around the molecule. Recent emission experiments have also revealed
additional features not previously seen in absorption. For a number of other
PAMs (phthalocyanine, Mg-phthalocyanine, pentacene), when an electronic
and vibrational mode in the impurity molecule are simultaneously excited,
the resulting emission spectrum as the molecule relaxes to the ground state
is similar to that for absorption, except each line is split into two peaks that
are separated by ∼ 14.8 K. 10 This suggests that the helium dynamics after
electronic excitation are more complicated than previously thought.

In this work, we present the results of quantum Monte Carlo calculations
for small numbers of helium atoms (N ≤ 24) around various PAMs. The
strength and anisotropy of the molecule-helium interaction gives rise to a
strongly localized layer of helium atoms on the molecule surface in the cluster
ground states. This localization has important consequences for the excited
states, 9 and we report some preliminary results for excitations due to the
vibrational motion of helium atoms in this ﬁrst monolayer. We propose
that the strong ground state localization implies similar conﬁnement of the
excited state, which may consequently aﬀect the dynamics of energy transfer.

2. THEORY AND METHODS

The Hamiltonian for the 4HeN -PAM cluster consists of the rigid-body
kinetic energy for the PAM, the translational kinetic energy for the N 4He
atoms, and the total potential energy ˆV . This ˆV is taken as a sum over
two-body helium-helium 11 and helium-PAM interactions, where the helium-
PAM interaction VI is a sum of atom-atom Lennard-Jones pair potentials in
the principal axis frame of the molecule:

The sum over α = C, H, N runs over the individual atoms of the molecule
situated at the position rα, and Lennard-Jones parameters ǫα, σα were taken
from Vidali et al. 12 The potentials evaluated in this manner are qualitatively
similar. Each of the potentials for the linear PAMs exhibits minima near
the center of the aromatic rings. The global minima in the potential of
each molecule occur at ∼ 2.7 ˚A above and below the molecule surface. The
potential for tetracene at this distance from the molecule surface is shown
in Figure 1c.

Ground state properties are obtained using diﬀusion Monte Carlo (DMC)
methods, in particular the importance-sampled rigid body diﬀusion Monte
Carlo algorithm. 13 The trial functions used here are products of two-body
factors,

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Ground state helium density distributions for 4He4-naphthalene, 4He6-
anthracene, 4He8-tetracene, and 4He24-phthalocyanine were obtained using
the quantum Monte Carlo methods described above. The number of 4He
atoms around each of the PAMs studied here corresponds to full coverage
of both sides of the nanosubstrate surface. In all cases, the global density
maxima occur at a distance of z ∼ 2.9 − 3.2 ˚A above and below the molecule
plane. Figures 1a, 1b, 1d, and 2a show cuts of the local helium density at
this distance, along a plane parallel to the molecule surface. It is apparent
that the local helium densities consist of well-separated peaks, each corre-
sponding to a single 4He atom. For the linear PAMs, each individual 4He
atom is approximately situated above a six-membered carbon ring. For ph-

thalocyanine, we ﬁnd that this surface can support up to 12 4He atoms on
each side. At full coverage, this 2D layer of 4He on phthalocyanine consists
of four 4He atoms grouped near the center of the molecule, surrounded by
an outer ring of eight 4He atoms.

Previous work with the 4HeN -benzene system (N = 1, 2, 3, 14) has re-
vealed similar ground state features. 9 The benzene system can be viewed as
the simplest 4HeN -PAM system, serving as a building block for models of
more complicated one- and two-dimensional nanosubstrates. In that study,
not only were the ground states observed to be strongly localized, but the ex-
cited states also exhibited localized character. That is, excitations due to the
localized vibrational motion of 4He on the benzene surface were found, with
energies of up to ∼ 23 K above the ground state. We propose here that these
excited state features exist generally for larger 4He-PAM systems, and that
they are a result of the strong localization of the helium ground state den-
sity distribution. Figure 2b shows the spectral density function [Eq. (4)] for
4He8-tetracene, evaluated using the POITSE methodology discussed above.
For a choice of ˆa† = x and x2, where the x-direction is taken to be along the
long axis of the molecule, we ﬁnd excitations at 6.3, 9.9, 20.8 K above the
ground state. These states correspond to the collective vibrational motion of
the 4He atoms moving on the molecule surface along the x-direction. Work
is currently in progress to extend these calculations to larger N , in order
to ascertain whether the collective character of these excitations persists as

additional atoms are added around the molecule.

A helium excitation conﬁned on the molecule surface would have impor-
tant consequences for spectroscopy, particularly for the dynamics of energy
dissipation. Typically, the molecule is excited from the electronic ground
state S0 to an electronic excited state S1. For a weakly interacting small
molecule in a vibrationally excited state of S1, this excess vibrational energy
is transferred to the local helium environment. It is generally assumed that
this energy is rapidly carried away from the molecule due to the large ther-
mal conductivity of He II. 14 In a helium droplet, this energy is dissipated
as helium atoms boil oﬀ the surface of the droplet, and so the relaxation
back to S0 derives primarily from the ground vibrational state of S1. On the
other hand, if the excess vibrational energy of the molecule is transferred
to the helium and trapped near the surface of the molecule, the resulting
local helium environment could be very diﬀerent from that of the ground
vibrational state and would then correspond to a metastable state. These
two situations could give rise to two distinct S1 surfaces, resulting in a split
emission spectrum similar to that observed by Lehnig and Slenczka. 10 Calcu-
lation of the local helium density for the S1 state, which requires a currently
unknown interaction potential, would facilitate a more detailed analysis.

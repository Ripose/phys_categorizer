Abstract

A new approach is described to the evaluation of the S -matrix in three-dimensional atom-diatom

reactive quantum scattering theory. The theory is developed based on natural collision coordinates

where progress along the reaction coordinate can be viewed as fulﬁlling the same role as time in a

time-dependent formulation. By writing the full wavefunction in coupled-channel form it is proved

that the 3D quantum reactive scattering problem can be treated in the same way as an inelastic

single-arrangement problem. In particularly, two types of coupled-channel representations, which

are reduced to two diﬀerent systems of coupled ﬁrst order ordinary diﬀerential equations describing

the inelastic scattering, are used. The ﬁrst system of coupled diﬀerential equations is constructed

on a set of points (grid) of the coordinate reaction curve after solution of many 1D Schr¨odinger

problems in the directions normal to the reaction coordinate. The second expression for inelastic

scattering is found using exactly solvable nonstationary 1D Schr¨odinger equation (etalon equation

method), which is introduced for describing the localization properties of the full wavefunction along

the curve of coordinate reaction. In this case we avoid a large amount of computation involved

in solving the 1D Schr¨odinger problem along the reaction coordinate by using a slightly diﬃcult

initial conditions for the inelastic scattering equations.

In both cases by solving the system of

coupled ﬁrst order ordinary diﬀerential equations, the full wavefunction and all S -matrix elements

are obtained simultaneously without further calculations. Our analysis shows that the methods we

have developed constitute the simplest algorithms for computing the reactive scattering S -matrices.

INTRODUCTION

Accurate quantum dynamics approaches have made an immense impact on the theory

of elementary atom-molecule collisions [1, 2, 3]. Recent advances in accurate quantum

mechanical calculations on simple few atom systems have demonstrated the possibility of

obtaining detailed information concerning chemical reactions from ﬁrst principles [4, 5, 6].

Tremendous progress has occurred in developing and applying both time-independent and

time-dependent quantum dynamics approaches the last few years.

At present there are three common approaches used in the quantum reactive scattering

ﬁeld:

1. The hyperspherical coordinate methods [7, 8],

2. The variational methods based on the simultaneous use of mass-scaled Jacobi coordi-

nates in each of the chemical arrangements involved [9, 10, 11] and

3. Wavepacket methods [12, 13] (many references can be found in the review [14]).

Both time-dependent and time-independent approaches have been successfully applied to

three- and four-atom reactions. For detailed information at low energy the time-independent

hyperspherical coordinate approach has proven the most useful [4, 15]. The time-dependent

wavepacket method has also proved to be very useful, particularly for photodissociation

and laser-molecule interaction problems. To go beyond four-atom systems, the Multi-

Conﬁgurational Time-Dependent Hartree method has been applied in full-dimensionality

to calculate thermal rate constants for the H + CH4 [16] and O + CH4 [17] reactions.

Despite the successful applications to polyatomic systems mentioned above, general ap-

plications still appear to be extremely diﬃcult. Quantum mechanics is nonlocal in character

and numerical eﬀorts to solve the Schr¨odinger equation increase exponentially with the

number of degrees of freedom. State resolved accurate quantum dynamical calculations are

presently limited to at most seven-dimensional problems [16]. Thus, the development of new

conceptual approaches permitting improved computational algorithms for accurate quantum

simulations is of great interest.

Earlier natural collision coordinates NCC allowing an analytical investigation of chemical

reactivity in collinear collisions were introduced by Marcus [18] and further explored by Light

3

[19, 20]. Light and coworkers [21, 22] generalized the NCC approach to three-dimensional

atom-diatom reactive scattering and on this basis they studied H + H2 system and its

isotopomers in 3D for total angular momentum J = 0 [23]. Related developments have

been the formulation and later use of the reaction-path hamiltonian formalism by Miller,

Handy and Adams [24] and the reaction path and reaction volume approaches advocated

by Billing [25, 26, 27, 28].

Due to diﬃculties in applying the NCC approach, attention turned to other coordinate

systems. Nevertheless, it seems to us that the primary idea of NCC, namely to simplify 3D

quantum reactive scattering calculations, can be realized. Particularly, one of the authors
has shown that for collinear three-body collisions, it is possible to constructed the S-matrix

exactly, in simple form using the approach [29, 30]. Seven reactive systems, N2 + N, N2 +

O, O2 + O, Li + FH, O2 + N etc have been studied successfully within this framework [31].

The aim of the current article is to generalize our previous collinear NCC quantum

scattering approach to a full three dimensional treatment.

A. The coordinate systems

We denote the masses of the particles by mA, mB and mC and the coordinates of the

particles are denoted by the column vectors rA, rB and rC describing their positions relative

to an origin ﬁxed in the laboratory system. The initial 9D problem can be reduced to a 6D

one by elimination of the center-of-mass coordinates.
Below we consider the reaction A + (BC)n →

For this reaction reactant and product Jacobi coordinates are illustrated in Fig.1. The

following equations deﬁne the Jacobi coordinates Rα and rα (note that index α corresponds

to (in) or reactant asymptotic channel):

Note that here and in the following we omit the α channel index for simplicity. In Eq.

(4) µ is the reduced mass deﬁned in Eq. (3), Pq is the moment vector conjugate to q, in the

body-ﬁxed system and θ is the angle between vectors q0 and q1 (see FIG. 1 and FIG. 2).

An alternative coordinate system (q0, q1, q2) is illustrated in FIG. 2. Either of the coordinate

systems (q0, q1, q2) and (q0, q1, θ) can be used to describe the motion of body-ﬁxed system in

the plane of the vectors (q0, q1) and they will be called intrinsic coordinates. The interaction

potential between all atoms depends only on the intrinsic coordinates.

The coordinates (q3, q4, q5) are taken to be the Euler angles Ω(

ζ1, ζ2, ζ3), which orient

≡

the three-body system in the space-ﬁxed frame (see for example refs. [13], [33] and [34]).

The optimal coordinate systems for reactants and products are diﬀerent [9, 35]. This

fact creates certain mathematical and computational complexities in the investigation of

the reactive scattering problem. One way to proceed is to turn to a special type of curvi-

linear coordinates which continuously leads from reactant channel to product channel. The

possibility of introducing the coordinate system which is simultaneously suitable for descrip-

tion of (in) and (out) asymptotic states was ﬁrst time discussed in the work [36]. At last

corrected version for collinear collision was presented in the work [18] and named natural

collision coordinate (NCC) system.

θ is a Jacobi scattering angle. The point

O′ is a center of mass diatom (AB) and θ′ is correspondingly Jacobi scattering angle which is used

in (out) channel.

In order to deﬁne the NCC appropriately, we connect the (in) and (out) asymptotic
ℑif . The curve depends on two parameters, one of which can be
chosen arbitrary and the other is system dependent. As progress along the curve represent

channels by a smooth curve

the passage from reactant to product during this it will be called reaction coordinate [18, 19].

chosen to make the curve pass close to the saddle point of the reaction. The constant b

depends on the mass of particles and is given by expression b = cotϕ =

new-formed diatom (AB) stops. The rotation of diatom (AB) is described by angle θ′ (see

FIG 2) which in the reactant region is limited to 0 but beginning from strong interaction

region up to (out) asymptotic channel obviously can have any value.

The coordinate u describes the translational motion of three-body system between re-

The signed distance from the curve

ℑif in the plane (q0,q1) is given by v. Note that the
Jacobi angle θ is not included in the deﬁnition of the curve. We can organize the one-to-

one mapping between coordinate systems (q0, q1, θ) and (u, v, θ) in only some subspace of

internal 3D conﬁguration space. It should be emphasized that above mentioned subspace

process is localized. This condition can be fulﬁlled if the coordinate reaction curve

must include a part of 3D space, in which the probability current of reactive scattering
ℑif is
correctly determined for a conﬁguration of reactive collision with the minimal energy surface

(see FIG. 3). It is obvious that in this case the condition of one-to-one mapping between

coordinate systems for any conﬁguration of reactive collision can be automatically satisﬁed.

After satisfying aforementioned condition it is easy to write transformations between set

of coordinates (q0, q1) and (u, v) [37]:

ℑif in such way that the region of self-crossing of coordinate lines (the black color regions)
moves far away from the region of localization of the probability current of reactive process for

In this case the correct description of

process of collision for any conﬁguration is ensured. The NCC coordinate is a locally orthogonal

3D coordinate system, which is attached to the curve

These properties ensure that the full wavefunction can be conditionally (locally) factorized.

So, we deﬁned NCC system for investigation of 3D reactive quantum scattering which for

Schr¨odinger equation (17) is in a form which is suitable for further investigation by the
coupled channels method. This will be done in section III. C after the S-matrix has been

deﬁned in Section III. B.

B. Deﬁnition of S-matrix in term of reaction coordinate

In the standard scattering theory the main problem is the construction of the scattering
S -matrix, holding the transition amplitudes. Let us discuss the exact representation for the
S-matrix in terms of overlap between stationary wavefunctions (see for example [38, 39]).

In the body-ﬁxed NCC system we can write the following general formal expression:

Φ(+)J

njK (uα, vα, θα) =

n′j ′K ′ ← nj K Φ(−)J

n′j ′K ′(uβ, vβ, θβ),

where Φ(+)J

njK (uα, vα, θα) and Φ(−)J

n′j ′K ′(uβ, vβ, θβ) are the total stationary wavefunctions in cor-

states, n and j are vibration and rotation quantum numbers, SJ

n′j ′K ′ ← njK are an complex

matrix elements.

In the expression (29) Sn′j ′K ′ ← njK maybe interpreted as a general form for the reactive S-
matrix elements. Evidently from deﬁnition of the S-matrix elements (29) the integration over

E

coordinate u is absent, however it is easy to understand that in the (out) asymptotic region

the full phase is cancelled out and thus Sn′j ′K ′ ← njK -matrix elements become independent

from coordinate u.

Now the diﬀerential reactive state-to-state cross section may be simply constructed with

the help of matrix elements SJ

n′j ′K ← njK(E) (see particularly works [1, 13, 42]):

The total integral reactive cross section for reaction from a particular initial state to all

So, we have obtained a new representation (29) for the scattering S-matrix, where the
ℑif , plays a role much as usually time
does in standard quantum scattering theory. The reaction coordinate u could thus be viewed

coordinate u, which varies along the reaction curve

as an intrinsic time of the scattering.

C. Coupled-channel expression for full wavefunction and S-matrix elements

Remembering that along u the system is in translational motion, while along v and θ the

motion is localized we employ the time-independent coupled-channel (CC) approach.

It is convenient to write down the intrinsic full wavefunction in the following form (see

for example [37]):

Φ(+)J

K ′̺ (u, v, θ) =

G(+)J

¯n¯jK ′ ̺(u)Ξ¯n(¯j)(v; u)Θ¯jK ′(θ),

̺ = (njK),

(33)

X¯n¯j

and necessitate the wavefunction (33) to satisfy to initial conditions (20). Note that it is

standard way to obtain close coupled equations for scattering (or translational) function
G(+)J

¯n¯jK ′̺(u).
The vibrational part of the wavefunction Ξn(j)(u, v) forms an orthonormal basis in the

variable v for each ﬁxed value of u and satisﬁes the equation:

Uef f (u, v).

(35)

Recall, that U(u, v, θ)

In some situations it is useful to approximate U (u, v) such that Eq. (34) can be analyti-

Now we turn to the derivation of S-matrix elements using the representation for the full

wavefunction (33).

As it is known the full wavefunction of three-body system is determined by the set of three

quantum numbers (n, j, K). If we want to describe the full wavefunction of body system

with the help of representation (33) it is necessary to demand the asymptotic condition:

asymptotic wavefunction Φ(in)J

→ −∞

njK (u, v, θ) (see formula (20) ).

The S-matrix elements are obtained after substituting (33) into the expression (30):

The expression for S -matrix elements in the (45) can be simpliﬁed, if we take as basis

So, we have now shown that the initial quantum scattering problem can be exactly

reduced to the standard set of N coupled second order diﬀerential equations (38)-(39) in

a single variable u (where N is the number of channels or coupled equations). For the

solution of this system of equation it is useful to represent it to the form (41). The matrix

equation (41) has 2N linearly independent solutions. There are several standard ways in

which this set of equations may be solved [3, 43, 45, 46]. The 2N independent solutions are

then combined to give N solutions which obey the asymptotic conditions as set out in Eqs.

(44). The process of combining the independent solutions to satisfy the boundary conditions
automatically yields the S-matrix elements.

D. Etalon equation method, full wavefunction and S-matrix elements

During the development of the algorithm for numerical simulation based on aforemen-

tioned theoretical approach it is necessary to recover the scattering matrix equation (41)-(43)

on the grid. The grid is formed along the reaction coordinate curve, which connects (in)

and (out) scattering channels. The problem is that at each point of the grid one has to
solve Mi = ni ×
integration to ﬁnd the form of the matrix equation (41) on the grid. This procedure re-

ji number of one-dimensional quantum problem and by further numerical

quires huge amount of computer resource and undergoes the accumulation of computation

errors. Besides matrix equation (41) in this case will be given as a numerical array, which is

extremely inconvenient for numerical simulation with changing integration scale. In order

to overcome this diﬃculty one can use the exactly solvable model for vibration states in

18

the total wavefunction coupled-channel expression. This allows getting analytical form for

one-dimensional matrix equation of reactive scattering.

So, for full wavefunction can be written another coupled-channel representation:

So, we found a new analytical expression for the S -matrix elements of reactive scatter-

ing (62) with the help of exactly solvable etalon equation (49) and we will call it etalon

equation method. Obviously this method is favorable for numerical simulation. Particularly
computation of S -matrix elements (62) in this case is relatively simple too.

IV. CONCLUSION

The introduction of natural collision coordinates by Marcus [18] was intended to simplify

quantum reactive scattering calculations.

In spite of signiﬁcant eﬀorts [19, 20, 21] the

application of this method to 3D reactive scattering has encountered considerable diﬃculties,

and as a consequence the investigations in this direction ceased in 1988 (see for example

report [3]). In particular, the following two problems can be indicated:

1. For an atom-diatom arrangement reaction A + BC in 3D, at every conserved total

angular momentum J, the vibrational coordinate v (see Fig. 3) becomes a 2D (ro-

vibrational) surface in the 3D intrinsic space which speciﬁes the size and the shape

of three-atom triangle. It is signiﬁcant that this surface has extremely complicated

the metric properties and can be investigated with the help of diﬃcult numerical

calculations [22].

2. The third arrangement reaction AC +B (see schema 1) must also be included in the 3D

computation schema. However, this leads to problems in the understanding of trans-

22

lational reaction coordinate idea. Moreover, technical diﬃculties arise by matching

surfaces between the three arrangement channels.

Nevertheless the mentioned diﬃculties either can be overcame in the intrinsic 3D space or

they do not play an essential role in the framework of this consideration.

Hence, if we deﬁne three diﬀerent curves of the reaction coordinate

ℑif analogously to
(5) by the way they connect diﬀerent asymptotic subspaces ( diﬀerent reactant and product

channels) one can describe all the scattering channels (see schema 1). From the other side,

by deﬁning this curve and correspondingly NCC system carefully on the case of collinear

collision all possible conﬁguration of reactive scattering may be described.

In recent articles [29, 30, 31], one of the authors together with colleagues have analyzed

in detail the diﬃculties arising in the formulation of quantum scattering theory in NCC

system.

In particular, it was shown for the case of a collinear scattering process in NCC system

that a procedure similar to that described above for the 3D case could eﬀectively yield the
exact S-matrix.

In this article the quantum reactive scattering theory in curvilinear reaction coordinates

has been generalized to the 3D case.

We have started with Schr¨odinger equation of thee-body system in Jacobi coordinates

(10). Using the coordinate transformation given in Eqs.

(5)-(8) this equation has been

transformed into the NCC system. The reaction coordinate u (or τ ) may be considered as a

chronological parameter in the theory (i.e. intrinsic time), and plays a role analogous to that

of time in standard time-dependent scattering theory. Representing the full wavefunction

of three-body system by standard coupled-channel form (33) the initial 3D multi-channel

quantum scattering problem (17) with correspondingly initial and border conditions (20)

may be reduced to an inelastic single-arrangement problem Eq. (38)-(39) or (41)-(43). As

a result of this reducing after the solution of system of Eq. (41)-(43) on a set of points u
ℑif (grid) the full wavefunction and all transition S-matrix

of curve of reaction coordinate
elements are found simultaneously (see expression for S-matrix elements (47)).

Another direction of investigation of Schr¨odinger Eq. (17) is the representation of solu-

tion for full wavefunction of three-body system in the coupled-channel form (48) combined

with the exact solvable etalon equation method (see Eqs.

(49)-(50)). Recall that etalon

equation describes the localization properties of full wavefunction along the curve of reac-

23

tion coordinate

ℑif . This method reduces the 3D quantum multichannel scattering problem
to inelastic 1D single-arrangement problem too. Still, the initial conditions for the system

of diﬀerential equations (60) in this case are a little bit complicated and can be found by

the solution of linear algebraic equations system (58)-(59).

Note that this is an important theoretical result, which seems to very useful for numerical

calculations. Remind that in traditional approached the 1D scattering problem Eq. (34)-

(35) is constructed after very grate volume of grid computations of 1D Schr¨odinger problem

along the reaction coordinate.

The main theoretical advantage is that the wavefunction and all the body-ﬁxed S-matrix

elements are determined from the solution of standard coupled diﬀerential equations in only
one variable u (the scattering coordinate) simultaneously. The body-ﬁxed S-matrix is used

to determine all the diﬀerential and integral state-to-state reactive scattering cross sections

of the system (see formulas (30) and (31) ).

It is obviously that on the basis of developed S -matrix representations the maximally-

possible eﬀective parallel algorithms for direct numerical simulation of 3D reactive quantum

scattering problem may be elaborated. Particularly numerical solution of both systems of

inelastic scattering equations (39) or (41)-(43) and (60) can be realized with the help of the
R-matrix propagation method simultaneously yields the full wavefunction and all S -matrix

elements without further calculations.

Finally, we would like to note that the usage of NCC system in quantum multichannel

scattering theory will permit to carry out similar type reduction for any amount of atoms.

This will essentially simplify the calculation.

APPENDIX A: MASS-SCALED DISTANCES BETWEEN THREE-BODY

For right introducing of NCC system it is necessary that curve of reaction coordinate
ℑif in the plan of (q0, q1) connect two equilibrium distances of diatoms of (in) and (out)
asymptotic channels. Let us consider the distant between A and B particles in the (in)

Jacobi coordinates (see FIG 1.):

where b = ρλ2 = cot ϕ, and q2 is mass-scaled distance between A and B particles. Now we

can investigate the asymptotic behavior of mass-scaled distance q2. From Eq. (A2) with

In order to do this, ﬁrst we calculate the non-diagonal terms. Using (5) and (6), as well as

the fact that x0 and x1 are orthogonal, one can obtain from (B1) the following expression:

Both these solutions are connected with each other by Bogoliubov [55] linear transformations:

Coeﬃcients C1 and C2 are easily calculated, using of properties of hypergeometric functions:

Recall that similar to (D4), the following expression may be written for the solution σout(τ ):

Now taking into account (D4), (D5)and (D6) for coeﬃcient C1 and C2 we obtain:

Finally from (D7) we can ﬁnd the normalization expression:

2 = 1.

So, taking into account (D3) and (D7), we get the exact solution of Eq. (51), which we must

use for future analytical computations, in the form (D4).

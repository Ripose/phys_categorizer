Abstract. A previously proposed computational procedure for constructing a set
of nonorthogonal strongly localised one-electron molecular orbitals (O. Danyliv, L.
Kantorovich - Phys. Rev. B, 2004, to be published) is applied to a perfect α-
quartz crystal characterised by an intermediate type of chemical bonding. The orbitals
are constructed by applying various localisation methods to canonical Hartree-Fock
orbitals calculated for a succession of ﬁnite molecular clusters of increased size with
appropriate boundary conditions. The calculated orbitals span the same occupied
Fock space as the canonical HF solutions, but have an advantage of reﬂecting the true
chemical nature of the bonding in the system. The applicability of several localisation
techniques as well as of a number of possible choices of localisation regions (structure
elements) are discussed for this system in detail.

Strongly localised molecular orbitals

1. Introduction

A quantum cluster embedding [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] has become a powerful computational
tool in electronic structure theory of extended systems, such as large biological molecules
[7, 1, 8, 9, 2], surface defects and adsorption on crystal surfaces [10, 11, 12] or points
defects in the bulk of crystalline [13, 14] or amorphous [15] systems. The embedding
methods originate from a model in which a single local perturbation is considered in the
direct space of the entire system inside of a ﬁnite quantum molecular cluster in great
detail, whereas a more approximate method is used to account for the rest of the system
surrounding the cluster.

A rather general embedding method is presently being developed in our laboratory.
The central idea of our method is based on the exact partitioning of the entire system
electron density into two components, one localised within the cluster and the other -
outside it, i.e in the environment. Construction of overlapping (not orthogonal) strongly
localised molecular orbitals (LMO’s) as building blocks of the entire system is crucial
for this technique. The LMO’s are designed to represent the true electronic density of
reference systems (such as e.g. 3D ideal perfect crystals or 2D periodic crystal surfaces)
and are constructed to have transparent chemical meaning, e.g. to represent ions in the
case of ionic systems and covalent bonds in covalently bound systems. Although we are
not yet concerned in this study with biological systems which do not possess periodicity,
we note that most of the ideas of our method can also be applied to these systems as
well.

A convenient and simple method for calculating the LMO’s for 3D periodic systems
(e.g. perfect crystals) was recently suggested in [16]. This method is based on ﬁnding
appropriate linear combinations of the canonical Hartree-Fock (HF) solutions for a
sequence of ﬁnite molecular clusters of increased size. The linear combinations are
chosen in such a way as to optimise special localising functionals constructed to obtain
orbitals localised within certain regions (e.g. bonds, atoms, ions, etc.). There may be
several diﬀerent regions in every unit cell of the crystal.

The method was successfully applied in [16] to two cases of extreme ionic (MgO
In both cases four LMO’s were found in
crystal) and covalent (Si crystal) bonding.
every unit cell. In the former case every unit cell is composed of a single region which
is associated with an oxygen ion; the region contains eight electrons and is described
by four mutually orthogonal LMO’s. In the latter case (the Si crystal) every unit cell
is represented by four neighbouring regions. Each region is associated with a pair of
nearest Si atoms, contains 2 electrons and is described by a single double occupied LMO.
The four regions belonging to the same unit cell have one common Si atom at the centre
of a tetrahedron and other four Si atoms form its vertices. The four LMO’s within the
same cell do overlap and thus are not orthogonal.

The main purpose of this paper is to check if our method [16] can be extended to
systems which have more complicated types of chemical bonding. This is invaluable for
the future development of our embedding method towards describing insulating crystals

with arbitrary type of bonding. Therefore, we here consider in detail the α-quartz
(SiO2) crystal, which may be thought of as a prototype system with an intermediate
(ionic-covalent) type of chemical bonding. Essentially two main questions are addressed
here with respect to the localisation of the calculated LMO’s: (i) the choice of regions
and (ii) the choice of localisation methods (i.e. the localisation functionals).

The plan of the paper is the following.

In the next section the main ideas of
our method are brieﬂy described (for the full discussion, see [16]). Three localisation
methods are introduced (one of them was not used in our previous study [16]) alongside
with a choice of three localisation criteria. Application of our method to the α-quartz
crystal is considered in Section 3. Brief conclusions are given in Section 4.

2. Localisation procedure

2.1. General approach

Let us assume that we know an occupied canonical set of one-electron molecular orbitals,
{ϕc
i(r)}, for a perfect 3D periodic crystal. These orbitals may be obtained as eigenvectors
of the appropriate Hartree-Fock (HF) problem using e.g. the CRYSTAL code [17] which
employs directly the periodic symmetry. In our method, however, we consider instead
a specially designed set of ﬁnite clusters of increased size and ﬁnd the HF solutions
for them using one of the available quantum chemistry packages. It was demonstrated
in [16] that this approach is equivalent to using a periodic-crystal electronic structure
approach as far as the LMO’s are concerned, provided that large enough molecular
clusters are used.

The canonical molecular orbitals (CMO’s) are orthogonal and span the entire
occupied Fock space. They are not localised in space, and have a non-zero contribution
on atoms of every unit cell in the crystal.
In practice, when the cluster method is
employed, they span the entire cluster. In other words, the CMO’s are assumed to be
given as a linear combination of the atomic orbitals, χµ(r), centred on all atoms of the
cluster in question:

ϕc

i(r) =

C c

µiχµ(r)

Xµ

(1)

e

In order to describe the crystal as a set of overlapping (non-orthogonal) localised
ϕa(r)}, which span the same occupied Fock space, one has to obtain
functions, {
appropriate linear combinations of the original canonical set {ϕc
i(r)}. In order to do
ϕa(r)
this, it is ﬁrst necessary to identify regions of space where each of the functions
has to be localised. Although any (non-singular) linear combination of the canonical
set will give the same electron density ρ(r), we adopt here a strategy based on the
chemistry of the system in question. Namely, the choice of the localisation regions
in the ﬁrst instance is based on the expected type of the chemical bonding in the
system, e.g. atoms/ions in the cases of atomic/ionic systems, two nearest atoms in
the case of covalent bonding, etc. A more complicated choice is anticipated in the

e

Strongly localised molecular orbitals

cases of intermediate bonding as will be demonstrated in Section 3. Several diﬀerent
nonequivalent regions may be necessary to represent a crystal unit cell which can then
be periodically translated to reproduce the whole inﬁnite crystal. Note that several
localised orbitals may be associated with each region. For instance, in the case of the
Si crystal one needs four localised regions associated with four bonds; each bond is
represented by a single double occupied localised orbital and all four bonds have one
common Si atom in the centre of the tetrahedron.

Once the localised regions are identiﬁed, it is necessary to ﬁnd linear combination

of the CMO’s which are localised in each of the regions,

In general, any localisation procedure is equivalent to some transformation U of
the CMO’s. To ﬁnd the necessary transformation for, say, region A, an optimisation
(minimisation or maximisation) problem is formulated for some speciﬁc localising

paper.

Note, that LMO’s associated with diﬀerent regions will not be orthogonal in this
method. This is because they are obtained from diﬀerent localising functionals which
strongly depend on the region in question, so that LMO’s from diﬀerent regions are

Using a physical argument, each region is associated with a certain even number
of electrons 2n. Therefore, if ΩA is minimised, we choose the ﬁrst n eigenvectors of the

Strongly localised molecular orbitals

problem (4); if, however, ΩA is maximised, the last n solutions are adopted. By collecting
LMO’s from all regions in the unit cell and then translating those over the whole crystal
it should be possible to span the whole occupied Fock space and thus construct the total
electron density (3). The larger the ﬁnite cluster used while calculating the canonical
orbitals, the closer the Fock space will be reproduced by the LMO’s.

To summarise, we ﬁrst suggest a possible set of localisation regions in the unit
cell and then consider a set of ﬁnite molecular clusters (with appropriate boundary
conditions) which have all these regions in their central part. Then, we obtain the
occupied canonical HF orbitals for each of the clusters using a standard quantum-
chemistry package. Out of all the clusters considered, a cluster is chosen for which
the electron density is well converged in its central part. Next, using a localisation
functional, canonical occupied HF orbitals of the chosen cluster are transformed into
LMO’s. The procedure is repeated for several localisation functionals and in each case
localisation criteria are applied. Then, if necessary, a diﬀerent choice of localisation
regions is made, and the whole procedure is repeated. As will be seen in Section 3, in
the case of the SiO2 crystal, three diﬀerent sets of regions can be suggested; however,
the same set of clusters will be used to calculate the LMO’s in each case.

2.2. Localising functionals

diagonal electron “density” associated with region A,

where the summation is performed over all n LMO’s of region A. Note that for
convenience of the ﬁnal equations we have omitted a factor of two above as it is
unimportant for the eigenproblem (4) to be solved. Therefore, the functionals can
be represented in the following general form:

2.2.1. Mulliken’s net population (method M)
In this method the localisation region A
is speciﬁed by a selection of AO’s (e.g. on one or two particular atoms in the unit cell).
Then, the net atomic Mulliken’s [20] population produced by the LMO’s in the selected
region is maximised [21, 19, 16]. In this case

where Sµν is the overlap integral between two AO’s χµ and χν. The summation here
is performed over AO’s which are centred in the chosen region A. This way one can
make the LMO’s to have a maximum contribution from the speciﬁed AO’s in region A.
Sometimes a diﬀerent choice of AO’s centred on the same atoms may lead to physically
identical localisation; however, this is not the case in general [16]. This method will be
referred to as method M.

2.2.2. Mulliken’s gross population (method G) If,
instead, the Mulliken’s gross
population on the atoms belonging to region A is maximised, one arrives into the Pipek-
Mezey localisation scheme [22, 19]. In this case the expression for ΩA

The ﬁrst summation here is performed over AO’s which are centred in the chosen region

as method G.

2.2.3. The projection on the atomic subspace (method P) The Roby’s population
maximisation [23] gives LMO’s for which the projection on the subspace spanned by
the basis orbitals centred within the selected region A is a maximum, or is at least

Here the ﬁrst double summation is performed over all AO’s of the system. Note that
ΩA projects any orbital into a subspace spanned by the AO’s
the idempotent operator
associated with region A only. Therefore, by choosing particular AO’s (and thus the
b
region) one ensures the maximum overlap of the LMO’s with them. It is seen that this
method, which will be referred to as method P, although diﬀerent in implementation, is
very similar in spirit to the previous two methods.

2.3. Localisation criteria

An application of the various schemes described above results in LMO’s which are
localised in the 3D space diﬀerently. It is therefore useful to have simple criteria which
can identify the degree of their localisation. Note that each of the localisation methods of
the previous subsection corresponds to a particular linear combination of the canonical
orbitals and thus will result in exactly the same electron density (3) provided, of course,
that a suﬃciently large cluster has been used in the LMO’s calculation. We assume in
this section that this is always the case.

Three methods will be used to assess the localisation of calculated LMO’s [16].

2.3.1. Localisation index The ﬁrst method was proposed by Pipek and Mezey [22] and
is based on the calculation of the so-called localisation index :

where the ﬁrst summation is run over all atoms B of the entire system. Here the quantity
in the square brackets is similar to the diagonal part of the localisation operator matrix
(9) calculated on real localised orbitals. Qualitatively, the localisation index gives the
ϕa(r) is predominantly localised. Therefore for
number of atoms on which the orbital
the ionic type of bonding one would expect da ∼ 1 and for a valence LMO describing a
covalent bonding da ∼ 2.

e

2.3.2. Eigenvalues of the overlap matrix Alternatively, the overlap between LMO’s
also gives an important information about their localisation. That is why as the second
criterion we shall consider the maximum eigenvalue of the overlap matrix. Note that
for periodic structures it is more convenient to use the Fourier transformation of the
overlap matrix [24]:

Sab(k) =

h

ϕa(r) |

XL

e

ϕb(r − L) i eikL
e

ϕa(r) and

ϕb(r) are LMO’s in the zero (central)
where k is a point in the Brillouin zone,
elementary unit cell and L is the lattice translation vector. Note, that if any of the
eigenvalues, λ(k), of the overlap matrix S = kSab(k)k is found to be larger than 2, it is
impossible to obtain the total crystal density in this basis by expanding the inverse of
the overlap matrix in Eq. (3) in powers of the overlap (the L¨owdin’s method, see [24]
for a detailed discussion). Therefore, the existence of large eigenvalues of the matrix S
corresponds to a weak localisation of the LMO’s.

e

e

2.3.3. Gap in eigenvalues of the localisation problem The eigenvalues λa of the secular
problem (4) can also be used to indicate the degree of localisation [16]. Indeed, if the
localisation functional ΩA used is appropriate, then (i) the chosen n solutions would
have close eigenvalues λa which correspond to their similar localisation in region A,

Strongly localised molecular orbitals

8

and (ii) the gap ∆λ in the eigenvalues λa between the chosen n and other solutions
is considerable, i.e. the other solutions will correspond to much worse localisation in
region A (cf. [25]). Therefore, in order to check the localisation of the LMO’s, we shall
also use the parameter ∆λ.

One may assume that better localisation will give larger gap value ∆λ. In principle,
if the given region and the right number of LMO’s n, associated with it, were chosen
correctly, one should expect some gap ∆λ in the eigenvalues λa.

3. SiO2 bulk

α-quartz (SiO2) crystal has a hexagonal Bravais lattice and corresponds to the D4
3
(P 3121, No. 152) space group symmetry [26, 27]. The equilibrium crystal structure
has been found using the Density Functional Theory, plane wave basis set, periodic
boundary conditions and the method of ultrasoft pseudopotentials as implemented in
the VASP code [28, 29, 30]. The calculation was carefully converged with respect to the k
point sampling and the plane wave cut-oﬀ. The lattice found is speciﬁed by elementary
2 , √3
2 , 0) and a3 = c(0, 0, 1) with a=4.913 ˚A
translations a1 = a(0, −1, 0), a2 = a( 1
and c=5.4046 ˚A. Each cell contains nine atoms distributed over three SiO2 molecules.
Three 3a positions (the local symmetry C2) are occupied by Si atoms, the position of
the ﬁrst Si atom is given by the fractional coordinates (−u, −u, 1
3 ) with u=0.4697; six
oxygen atoms occupy a general position 6c which can be generated from the fractional
coordinates (x, y, z) using x=0.4135, y=0.2669 and z=0.1191. The tetrahedron of
oxygen atoms with a silicon atom in its centre is almost regular with slightly diﬀerent
Si-O distances of R(Si1-O)=1.613 ˚A and R(Si2-O)=1.604 ˚A. The whole 3D crystal
units connected together at the Si atoms as
structure can be constructed from Si 1
shown schematically in Fig. 1(a). Four such units have a common Si atom at the centre
of a tetrahedron, six complete inequivalent units (positioned diﬀerently in space) form
an elementary cell. Note that this is similar to the Si crystal structure where the whole
crystal can be composed of Si 1

units [16].

Because of such an arrangement of atoms in the α-quartz crystal, it is reasonable
to assume that every unit Si 1
forms one independent region. However, as will
be shown in the following, one can alternatively consider two or three regions made
out of each unit as well. Therefore, in choosing a set of ﬁnite clusters, we ensured
unit was in the centre of each of the quantum clusters. Three
that the whole Si 1
clusters were considered: Si2O7, Si8O25 and Si40O103, containing 9, 33 and 143 atoms,
respectively. The smallest and middle size clusters used are shown in Fig. 1. To create
proper termination of the clusters at their boundary, we implemented special boundary
conditions suggested in [15]. In particular, we surrounded clusters by pseudoatoms Si*
which are directly connected to the cluster O atoms. Each Si* pseudoatom is made of
“classical (3/4-th) and “quantum” (1/4-th) parts. The “classical” part is represented by
the electrostatic potential due to a +1.8e point charge (which is a 3/4-th of the eﬀective
charge on a Si atom in the lattice), e being the elementary charge. The “quantum” part

Strongly localised molecular orbitals

9

of the Si* pseudoatom consists of a central repulsive electronic potential V (r) (added to
mimic the screening of the Si core by the valence electrons) and a single valence electron.
The parameters of the potential and the basis set for the pseudoatoms were optimised
to get proper eﬀective charges on Si and O atoms and to eliminate the contribution
of the Si* electron at the top of the valence and the bottom of the conduction bands.
Note that the described boundary conditions were found to be crucial only for the
smallest cluster; for other two clusters simpler boundary conditions (e.g. termination
by hydrogen atoms) were also tried and found to give practically identical results for the
LMO’s and thus will not be discussed further. To simulate the Madelung ﬁeld, clusters
were surrounded by an array of nearly 2.5 × 104 point charges, containing +2.4e charges
to mimic Si atoms and -1.2e charges for oxygens.

To simplify the initial HF calculations required to check the convergence of the
electron density with the cluster size and generate all occupied canonical molecular
orbitals, only valence (3s23p2 on Si and 2s22p4 on O) electrons were considered explicitly
by using for both species the coreless HF pseudopotentials (CHF) with LP-31G basis
set from Ref. [31]. The calculations were made with the use of the Gamess-UK package
[32].

Fig. 2 shows the convergence of the HF electron density with the size of the cluster
along the Si1-O direction. We carefully checked, by plotting the densities along other
directions and by making 2D plots, that this direction is representative for assessing
the convergence in this system. The deep minimum in the density at the oxygen atom
is due to the pseudopotential method used. One can see that the diﬀerence between
curves for the middle sized and the largest clusters is negligible. This suggests that the
middle sized cluster Si8O25 is perfectly suﬃcient for our purposes and thus was used in
all the calculations described below.

OSi 1

As has been mentioned above, the elementary “brick” we can build the system from
shown in the centre of each of the clusters in Fig.1 as a Si1-O-Si2
is the unit Si 1
molecule. Each such unit should be assigned 8 electrons in total: 6 electrons come from
the O atom and by 1 electron from each of the two Si atoms. Note that each Si atom
contributes to four diﬀerent units which contain this Si atom. This simple analysis
allows us to suggest at least three possible choices (models) for the localisation regions:

(i) Each unit Si 1

4

4

OSi 1

containing 8 electrons is considered as a single region; therefore,
to obtain the corresponding four (double occupied) LMO’s, one has to choose all
AO’s centred on the atoms Si1, Si2 and O in the centre of the cluster when applying
any of the localising functionals discussed above. Note that all four LMO’s obtained
using this partition method will be orthonormal as eigenvectors of the same secular
problem (4).

(ii) Each pair of atoms Si1-O and Si2-O can be considered as a separate region, i.e.
; four electrons
there will be two regions in total to describe every unit Si 1
distributed over two (double occupied) LMO’s will be associated in this case with
each of the two regions. Two LMO’s associated with either of the two regions will

be mutually orthogonal; however, the LMO’s belonging to diﬀerent regions will
have a non-zero overlap.

(iii) Finally, each unit can be split into three diﬀerent regions: (i) the ﬁrst region,
containing two electrons and described by a single LMO, is constructed to describe
a covalent bond Si1-O; this can be achieved by enforcing localisation on 2p AO’s of
the O atom and all AO’s of the Si1 atom; (ii) the second region is formed similarly
to describe the Si2-O bond; (iii) ﬁnally, the remaining four electrons are attached
to the third region which is localised predominantly on the O atom giving rise to
two more (double occupied) LMO’s; in this case the 2s AO’s centred on the O atom

direction. The convergence is obvious: the curves for the middle sized and the largest
clusters are indistinguishable.

can be used to inforce localisation. Thus, in this case there will be three sets of the
LMO’s: two orthogonal LMO’s belonging to the O region and other two LMO’s
belonging to the “bond” regions; the latter two LMO’s have a non-zero overlap
with any other LMO.

For each choice of the localisation regions described above (which will be referred to
as regions models hereafter), we can apply either of the three localisation methods of
Section 2 to calculate the LMO’s using the obtained occupied canonical orbitals of
the middle cluster. When solving the secular problem (4), the contributions of the
boundary pseudoatoms Si* were removed from the canonical orbitals which then were
renormalised. Using the obtained LMO’s, one should appropriately translate and rotate
them in order to obtain all LMO’s comprising the whole primitive cell. (For instance,
there will be six sets with four LMO’s in each in the primitive cell for model 1.) By
applying lattice translations to all the LMO’s associated with the primitive cell, the
whole inﬁnite crystal is reproduced. It is then possible to calculate the total electron
density ρ(r) of the whole crystal using Eq. (3). The necessary lattice summations are
handled exactly by converting into the k space [24]. These calculations have been done
for all nine cases (three localisation methods versus three choices of the localisation
regions). The calculated ρ(r) matched exactly the original HF density in the central
part of the cluster in all cases indicating that a very good degree of localisation was
achieved in each case. As an example, a 2D contour plot of the total valence electron
density in the plane of the molecule Si1-O-Si2 calculated using LMO’s obtained by
method M in model 1 is shown in Fig. 3. The cross-section of this plot corresponds to
a solid line (the middle cluster) in Fig. 2. One can see that a considerable amount of
the charge is concentrated around oxygen atoms.

Figure 3. The total electron valence density ρ(r) in the Si1-O-Si2 plane by combining
the contributions of LMO’s (method M, model 1) across the inﬁnite crystal. The
density was calculated using the method [24] based on Eq. (3).

The partial region densities, ρA(r) = σA(r, r) (see Eq. (5)), corresponding to each
of the regions and generated from the LMO’s calculated using method M, are shown in
Fig. 4 as closed 3D surfaces of constant density. The value of the density is chosen in
such a way so that 90% of the region electron charge be contained inside every surface.
In the case of model 1 (the upper panel) only one density is shown; in the case of model
2 (the middle panel) two densities are shown simultaneously, while in the third case
(model 3, the bottom panel), all three partial densities are presented. One can see that
in the cases of models 2 and 3 the LMO’s belonging to neighbouring regions strongly
overlap. As was mentioned before, the LMO’s belonging to diﬀerent regions for these
two models are not orthogonal. At the same time, the overall shapes of the density for
each of the region models are very similar demonstrating a clear aggregation around the
unit in agreement with the total density shown in
O atom in the middle of the Si 1
Fig. 3.

A comparison of the LMO’s calculated using three localisation methods is presented
in Fig. 5 for region model 1. In this ﬁgure, the partial densities ρA(r) are shown in
each case along the Si1-O direction through the Si 1
It is clear that the
partial density obtained from LMO’s calculated using method M are found slightly
more localised, whereas the localisation obtained using method P is slightly worse than
given by the two others. Still, the diﬀerence between the densities is extremely small so
that we can conclude at this point that all three techniques perform practically equally
well (at least for the system under discussion).

The picture becomes more complicated, however, at least at the ﬁrst sight, when
the localisation criteria of Section 2.3 are applied in each of the nine cases as shown
in Table 1. Three rows in this table correspond to the three diﬀerent region models;

chosen to enclose 90% of the total electron charge associated with the region. The
localisation method M was used in each case.

in each case there are four LMO’s in total which are occupied by eight electrons of

the elementary Si 1
diﬀerent localisation methods used, and each of the localisation criteria is shown for
every method.

The ﬁst criterion (the localisation index da) is slightly above one in most cases, and
is smaller than two in all nine cases. This means that the LMO’s are mostly localised
on a single atom with some contribution coming from the nearest atoms. However,
the maximum eigenvalues of the overlap matrix were found to be below two only for
the region model 1 and localisation methods M and G; in the cases of models 2 and
3 eigenvalues around three were found indicating worse localisation. Finally, the gap
between the eigenvalues of the secular problem of Eq. (4), ∆λ, was found to be too
small for the region models 2 and 3, whereas in the case of model 1 and for all three
localisation methods the gap is considerable, especially for methods M and G. This
means that the choice of the regions in models 2 and 3 is somewhat artiﬁcial which is

not surprising because of a very strong overlap between LMO’s corresponding to the
neighbouring regions in these two models.

It follows from this analysis that the model 1, in which the whole elementary
is considered as one region, results in the best localisation of the LMO’s,

especially if methods M and G are used.

In spite of subtle diﬀerences in the applied localisation criteria which seem to favour
the model 1 and the methods M and G, we stress that very good localisation of the
LMO’s was obtained in all cases. This conclusion is also supported by an observation
that LMO’s generated within diﬀerent models (choices of the regions) span the same
Fock space. To make such a conclusion, we calculated the projection of the LMO’s of
models 2 and 3 on the space spanned by the four orthogonal LMO’s obtained in model
1 and then subtracted the projection from the original orbitals. The calculated residual
parts were found negligible in all cases. Note, that this conclusion is not obvious because
each LMO depends on all AO’s of the entire cluster.

4. Conclusions

In this paper we have calculated strongly localised molecular orbitals (LMO’s) for the
SiO2 crystal (α-quartz) using the method developed earlier [16]. The starting point for
the choice of the localisation regions was an observation that the whole crystal can be
, containing an
reproduced by rotating and translating a single elementary unit Si 1
O atom and quarters of the two Si atoms which the O atom is directly connected to.
Three localisation methods were applied and three models for choosing the localisation
regions were tried in each case: (1) the whole unit was considered as one region; (2)
the unit was split into two and (3) three regions. Although in all cases well localised

the whole unit was chosen as a single region, is preferable.

The LMO’s produced in models 2 and 3 were found very close to a linear

the nearest regions belonging to the same elementary unit, they appeared to have a
signiﬁcant overlap with each other. On the other hand, the LMO’s belonging to diﬀerent
units (in either of the models) do not overlap strongly which is conﬁrmed by various
localisation criteria applied in this work and by the corresponding plots of the partial
densities.

Since our previous calculations reported in [16] were done for the extreme cases of
ionic (MgO) and covalent (Si) bonding, it follows from the results of the present study
that our method is also applicable to the crystals with intermediate types of chemical
bonding.

Note that we did not consider in this study localisation method E [16] based on
the energy minimisation of the structure element corresponding to the chosen region.
This is because it was found in [16] that the orbitals obtained by this method for the Si
crystal were not suﬃciently localised.

Although the LMO’s reported in this work may be useful to characterise the
chemical bonding in the given crystal, they are needed for the embedding method which
is under development. Diﬀerent possibilities in choosing localisation regions open up
various ways in terminating the quantum cluster when considering, e.g. a point defect

in the crystal bulk or an adsorbed species on the crystal surface. This variety of options
may be extremely useful in applications to keep the size of the cluster as small as
possible. If, for instance, one would like to terminate the cluster with Si atoms, then
either of the region models can be used (model 1 would probably be more convenient
as the orbitals within each region are orthonormal). However, if a termination with
oxygens is required, then region models 2 or 3 may prove to be more useful. In practice,
a combination of terminations may be preferable, when both Si and O atoms are used
at the boundary. In those cases all three models for choosing localisation regions may
be employed.

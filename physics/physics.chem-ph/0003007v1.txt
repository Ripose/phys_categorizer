Performance of Discrete Heat Engines and Heat Pumps in Finite

Time.

Tova Feldmann and Ronnie Kosloﬀ

Abstract

The performance in ﬁnite time of a discrete heat engine with internal friction

is analyzed. The working ﬂuid of the engine is composed of an ensemble

of noninteracting two level systems. External work is applied by changing

the external ﬁeld and thus the internal energy levels. The friction induces

a minimal cycle time. The power output of the engine is optimized with

respect to time allocation between the contact time with the hot and cold

baths as well as the adiabats. The engine’s performance is also optimized

with respect to the external ﬁelds. By reversing the cycle of operation a

heat pump is constructed. The performance of the engine as a heat pump is

also optimized. By varying the time allocation between the adiabats and the

contact time with the reservoir a universal behavior can be identiﬁed. The

optimal performance of the engine when the cold bath is approaching absolute

zero is studied. It is found that the optimal cooling rate converges linearly to

zero when the temperature approaches absolute zero.

I. INTRODUCTION

Analysis of heat engines has been a major source of thermodynamic insight. The second

law of thermodynamics resulted from Carnot’s study of the reversible heat engine [1]. Study

of the endo-reversible Newtonian engine [2] began the ﬁeld of ﬁnite time thermodynamics

1

[3–6]. Analysis of a virtual heat engine by Szilard led to the connection between thermo-

dynamics and information theory [7,8]. Recently this connection has been extended to the

regime of quantum computation [9].

Quantum models of heat engines show a remarkable similarity to engines obeying macro-

scopic dynamics. The Carnot eﬃciency is a well established limit for the eﬃciency of lasers

as well as other quantum engines [10–14]. Moreover, even the irreversible operation of quan-

tum engines with ﬁnite power output has many similarities to macroscopic endo-reversible

engines [15–19].

It is this line of thought that serves as a motivation for a detailed analysis of a discrete

four stroke quantum engine. In a previous study [20], the same model served to ﬁnd the

limits of the ﬁnite time performance of such an engine but with the emphasis on power

optimization. In that study the working medium was composed of discrete level systems

with the dynamics governed by a master equation. The purpose was to gain insight into

the optimal engine’s performance with respect to time allocation when external parameters

such as: the applied ﬁelds, the bath temperatures and the relaxation rates were ﬁxed.

The present analysis emphasizes the reverse operation of the heat engine as a heat pump.

For an adequate description of this mode of operation inner friction has to be a consideration.

Without it the model is deﬁcient with respect to optimizing the cooling power. Another

addition is the optimization of the external ﬁelds. This is a common practice when cold

temperatures are approached. With the addition of these two attributes, the four stroke

quantum model is analyzed both as a heat engine and as a refrigerator.

Inner friction is found to have a profound inﬂuence on performance of the refrigerator.

A direct consequence of the friction is a lower bound on the cycle time. This lower bound

excludes the non-realistic global optimization solutions found for frictionless cases [20] where

the cooling power can be optimized beyond bounds. This observation, has led to the sug-

gestion of replacing the optimization of the cooling power by the optimization of the cooling

eﬃciency per unit time [21–24]. Including friction is therefore essential for more realistic

models of heat engines and refrigerators with the natural optimization goal becomes either

2

the power output or the cooling power. The source of friction is not considered explicitly

in the present model. Physically friction is the result of non-adiabatic phenomena which

are the result of the rapid change in the energy level structure of the system. For example

friction can be caused by the missalignement of the external ﬁelds with the internal polariza-

tion of the working medium. For a more explicit description of the friction the interactions

between the individual particles composing the working ﬂuid have to be considered. The

present model is a microscopic analogue of the Ericsson refrigeration cycle [25] where the

working ﬂuid consists of magnetic salts. The advantage of the microscopic model is that

the use of the phenomenological heat transfer laws can be avoided [16]. The results of the

present model are compared to a recent analysis of macroscopic chillers [27]. In that study,

a universal modeling was demonstrated. It is found that the discrete quantum version of

heat pumps has behavior similar to that of macroscopic chillers.

There is a growing interest in the topic of cooling atoms and molecules to temperatures

very close to absolute zero [28]. Most of the analysis of the cooling schemes employed are

based on quantum dynamical models. New insight can be gained by employing a thermo-

dynamic perspective.

In particular the temperatures achieved are so low that the third

law of thermodynamics has to be considered. The discrete level heat pump can serve as

a model to study the third law limitations. The ﬁnite time perspective of the third law is

a statement on the asymptotic rate of cooling as the absolute temperature is approached.

These restrictions are imposed on the optimal cooling rate. The behavior of the optimal

cooling rate as the absolute temperature is approached is a third law upper bound on the

cooling rate. The main ﬁnding of this paper is that the optimal cooling rate converges to

zero linearly with temperature, and the entropy production reaches a constant when the

cold bath temperature approaches absolute zero.

II. BASIC ASSUMPTIONS AND FORMAL BACKGROUND FOR THE HEAT

ENGINE AND THE HEAT PUMP

Heat engines and heat pumps are characterized by three attributes: the working medium,

the cycle of operation, and the dynamics which govern the cycle. Heat baths by deﬁnition

are large enough so that their temperatures is constant during the cycle of operation. The

heat engine and the heat pump are constructed from the same components and diﬀer only

by their cycle of operation.

A. The Working Medium

The working medium consists of an ideal ensemble of many non-interacting discrete level

systems. Speciﬁcally, the analysis is carried out on two-level systems (TLS) but an ensemble

of harmonic oscillators [20] would lead to equivalent results.

The TLS systems are envisioned as spin-1/2 systems. The lack of spin-spin interactions

enables the description of the energy exchange between the working medium and the sur-

roundings in terms of a single TLS. The state of the system is then deﬁned by the average

occupation probabilities P+ and P− corresponding to the energies 1

2 ω and − 1
the energy gap between the two levels. The average energy per spin is given by

2 ω, where ω is

E = P+ ·(cid:18)1

2

ω(cid:19) + P− ·(cid:18)−

1
2

ω(cid:19)

The polarization, S, is deﬁned by

S =

1
2

(P+ − P−)

,

(2.1)

(2.2)

and thus the energy can be written as E = ωS. Energy change of the working medium can

occur either by population transfer from one level to the other (changing S) or by changing

the energy gap between the two levels (changing ω). Hence

dE = Sdω + ωdS .

(2.3)

4

Population transfer is the microscopic realization of heat exchange. The energy change due

to external ﬁeld variation is associated with work. Eq. (2.3) is therefore the ﬁrst law of

thermodynamics:

DW ≡ Sdω ; DQ ≡ ωdS .

Finally, for TLS the internal temperature, T ′, is always deﬁned via the relation

S = −

1
2

tanh(cid:18) ω

2kBT ′(cid:19) .

Note that the polarization S is negative as long as the temperature is positive.

(2.4)

(2.5)

B. The Cycle of Operation

1. Heat engines cycle

The cycle of operation is analyzed in terms of the polarization and frequency (S, ω). A

schematic display is shown in Fig.(1) for a constant total cycle time, τ . The present engine

is an irreversible four stroke engine [20] resembling the Stirling cycle, with the addition of

internal friction. The direction of motion along the cycle is chosen such that net positive

work is produced.

FIG. 1. The heat engine with friction in the ω ,S plane. Th is the hot bath temperature. τh is

the time allocation when in contact with the hot bath. Tc and τc represent the temperature and

time allocation for the cold bath. τa represents the time allocation for compression (ﬁeld change

from ωb to ωa) and τb for expansion. The area A,B, C1, D1 is the positive work done by the

system, while the areas C, C1, S1, S3, and D1, D, S4, S2 represent the negative work done by the

system.

The four branches of the engine will be now brieﬂy described.

On the ﬁrst branch, A → B, the working medium is coupled to the hot bath of temper-
ature Th for period τh, while the energy gap is kept ﬁxed at the value ωb. The conditions

are such that the internal temperature of the medium is lower than Th.

In this branch,

the polarization is changing from the initial polarization S2 to the polarization S1. The

inequality to be fulﬁlled is therefore:

S1 < −

1
2

tanh(cid:18) ωb

2kBTh(cid:19) .

(2.6)

Since ω is kept ﬁxed, no work is done and the only energy transfer is the heat ωb(S1 − S2)
absorbed by the working medium.

In the second branch, B → C the working medium is decoupled from the hot bath for a
period τa, and the energy gap is varied linearly in time, from ωb to ωa. In this branch work is

done to overcome the inner friction which develops heat, causing the polarization to increase

from S1 to S3 (Cf. Fig. 1). The change of the internal temperature is the result of two

opposite contributes. First lowering the energy gap leads to a lower inner temperature for

6

w
w
w
constant polarization S. Second increase in polarization due to friction, leads to an increase

of the inner temperature for ﬁxed ω. The inner temperature T ′ at point C might therefore

be lower or higher than the initial temperature at point B.

The third branch C → D, is similar to the ﬁrst. The working medium is now coupled to
a cold bath at temperature Tc for time τc. The polarization changes on this branch from S3

to the polarization S4. For the cycle to close, S4 should be lower than S2. At the end of the

cycle the internal temperature of the working medium should be higher than the cold bath

temperature, T ′ > Tc, leading to:

S4 > −

1
2

tanh(cid:18) ωa

2kBTc(cid:19) .

Since S4 < S1 (Fig. 1), it follows from Eq. ( 2.6) and Eq.( 2.7), that:

Tc(cid:19) > (cid:18) ωb
(cid:18) ωa
Th(cid:19)

Inequality (2.8) is equivalent to the Carnot eﬃciency bound, from Eq. (2.8) one gets:

1 − (cid:18)ωa

ωb(cid:19) < 1 − (cid:18) Tc

Th(cid:19) = ηCarnot

(2.7)

(2.8)

(2.9)

The present model is a quantum analogue of the Stirling engine which also has Carnot’s

eﬃciency as an upper bound.

The polarization S changes uni-directionally along the ’adiabats’ due to the increase of

the excited level population as a result of the heat developed in the working ﬂuid when work

is done against friction, irrespective of the direction of the ﬁeld change.

The fourth branch D → A, closes the cycle and is similar to the second. The working
medium is decoupled from the cold bath. In a period τb the energy gap is changing back to

its original value, ωb. The polarization increases from S4 to the original value S2.

The cycle of operation resembles the Ericsson refrigeration cycle [25]. The diﬀerences

are in the dynamics of the microscopic working ﬂuid which are described in subsection II C.

The work and heat transfer for the heat pump is summarized in Table II.

The four branches for the heat pump become:

In the ﬁrst branch, D → C, the working medium is coupled to the cold bath of tem-
perature Tc for time τc, while the energy gap is kept ﬁxed at the value ωa. The conditions

are such that the internal temperature of the medium is lower than Tc during τc. Along

this branch, the polarization changes from the initial polarization S1 to the polarization S2.

Since ω is kept ﬁxed, no work is done and the only energy transfer is the heat ωa(S2 − S1)
absorbed by the working medium. On this branch:

S2 < −

1
2

tanh(cid:18) ωa

2kBTc(cid:19) .

(2.10)

In the second branch, C → B the working medium is decoupled from the cold bath, and
the energy gap is varied. In the frictionless case the polarization S2 is constant (Left of Fig.

2). The only energy exchange is the work done on the system ( Table II). When friction is

added the polarization is changing from S2 to S3 in a period τa. The energy gap changes

from ωa to ωb (Right of Fig. 2), according to a linear law.

In addition to work, heat is

developing as a result of the inner friction ( Table II).

The third branch B → A, is similar to the ﬁrst. The working medium is coupled to the
hot bath at temperature Th, for time τh, keeping the energy gap ωb ﬁxed. In this branch the

polarization changes from S2 to S1 in the frictionless case, and from S3 to S4 when friction

is added. The constraint is that the internal temperature of the working medium should be

higher than the hot bath temperature during the time τh, T ′ > Th, leading to the inequality

(Fig. 2),

S1 > S4 > −

1
2

tanh(cid:18) ωb

2kBTh(cid:19) .

(2.11)

therefore S2 > S1. From Eqs. (2.10) and (2.11), the condition for the interrelation between

the bath temperatures and the ﬁeld values becomes:

9

Tc(cid:19) < (cid:18) ωb
(cid:18)ωa
Th(cid:19)

(2.12)

which is just the opposite inequality of the heat engine, (Eq. 2.8). In the heat pump work is

done on the working ﬂuid and since no useful work is done Carnot’s bound is not violated.

The fourth branch A → D, closes the cycle and is similar to the second. The working
medium is decoupled from the cold bath, and the energy gap changes back, during a period

τb to its original value, ωb.

The results are summarized in Table II.

C. Dynamics of the working medium

The dynamics of the system along the heat exchange branches is represented by changes

in the level population of the two-level-system. This is a reduced description in which

the dynamical response of the bath is cast in kinetic terms [18]. Since the dynamics has

been described previously [20] only a brief summary of the main points is presented here,

emphasizing the diﬀerences in the energy exchanges on the ’adiabats’.

1. The dynamics of the heat exchange branches

The dynamics of the population at the two levels, P+ and P−, are described via a master

equation

dP+

dt = −k↓P+ + k↑P−
dt = k↓P+ − k↑P−

dP−

,

(2.13)




where k↓ and k↑ are the transition rates from the upper to the lower level and vice versa.

The explicit form of these coeﬃcients depend on the nature of the bath and the system bath

coupling interactions. The thermodynamics partition between system and bath is consistent

with a weak coupling assumption [18]. Temperature enters through detailed balance. The

equation of motion for the polarization S obtained from Eq. (2.13) becomes:

2kBT(cid:19)

(2.14)

(2.15)

(2.16)

where Seq is the corresponding equilibrium polarization. It should be noticed that in a TLS

there is a one to one correspondence between temperature and polarization thus internal

temperature is well deﬁned even for non-equilibrium situations.

11

The general solution of Eq (2.14) is,

S(t) = Seq + (S(0) − Seq)e−Γt

.

where S(0) is the polarization at the beginning of the branch.

From Eqs. (2.14) and (2.16) the rate of heat change becomes:

˙Q = ω ˙S

See also [16].

For convenience, new time variables are deﬁned:

(2.17)

(2.18)

x = e−Γcτc

, y = e−Γhτh

(2.19)

These expressions represent a nonlinear mapping of the time allocated to the hot and cold

branches by the heat conductivity Γ. As a result, the time allocation and the heat conduc-

tivity parameter become dependent on each other.

Figure 1 and 2 show that the friction induces an asymmetry between the time allocated

to the hot and cold branches since more heat has to be dissipated on the cold branch.

2. The dynamics on the ’adiabats’

The external ﬁeld ω and its rate of change ˙ω are control parameters of the engine. For

simplicity it is assumed that the ﬁeld changes linearly with time:

ω(t) = ˙ωt + ω(0)

(2.20)

Rapid change in the ﬁeld causes non-adiabatic behavior which to lowest order is propor-

tional to the rate of change ˙ω. In this context non-adiabatic is understood in its quantum

mechanical meaning. Any realistic assumption beyond the ideal non-interacting TLS will

lead to such non-adiabatic behavior. It is therefore assumed that the phenomena can be

described by a friction coeﬃcient σ which forces a constant speed polarization change ˙S:

12

t′(cid:19)2
˙S = (cid:18)σ

(2.21)

where t′ is the time allocated to the corresponding ’adiabat’. Therefore, the polarization as

a function of time becomes:

t′(cid:19)2
S(t) = S(0) + (cid:18)σ

t

(2.22)

where t ≥ 0 , t ≤ t′. A modeling assumption of internally dissipative friction, similar to
Eq.(2.21), was also made by Gordon and Huleihil ( [26]). Friction does not operate on the

heat-exchange branches, there is no nonadiabtic eﬀect since the ﬁelds ωa and ωb are constant

in time. The irreversibilities on those branches are due to the transition rates (Γ) of the

master equation.

From Fig.(1), Eq. (2.4), and Eq. (2.22) the polarization, for the B → C branch of the

heat engine becomes:

SC = S3 = S1 +   σ2

τa ! .

The work done on this branch is:

WBC = Z τa

0

DW = Z τa

0

S ˙ωdt = (ωa − ωb) S1 +

1

2  σ2

τa!!

(2.23)

(2.24)

The heat generated on this branch in the working ﬂuid, which is the work against the friction,

becomes:

QBC = Z τa

0

DQ = Z τa

0

ω ˙Sdt =

σ2(ωa + ωb)

2τa

(2.25)

This work is dependent on the friction coeﬃcient and inversely on the time allocated to the

’adiabats’. The computation for the other branches of the heat engine and heat pump are

similar.

3. Explicit expressions for the polarizations imposed by the closing of the cycle.

By forcing the cycle to close, the four corners of the cycle observed in Fig. 1 are linked.

Applying Eq. (2.17) leads to the equations:

13

S1 = S2y + Seq

h (1 − y)

S3 = S1 + σ2
τa

S4 = S3x + Seq

c (1 − x)

S2 = S4 + σ2
τb

The solutions for S1, S2 and S1 − S2 are
c + ∆Seq(1−y) + σ2yG(x)
c + ∆Seqx(1−y) + σ2G(x)

S1 = Seq

S2 = Seq

(1−xy)

(1−xy)

h − ∆Seqy(1−x) − σ2yG(x)
h − ∆Seq(1−x) − σ2G(x)

and

where

S1 − S2 = (∆Seq)F (x, y) −

σ2(1 − y)G(x)

(1 − xy)

(2.26)

(2.27)

(2.28)

F (x, y) =

(1 − x)(1 − y)

(1 − xy)

, ∆Seq = (Seq

h − Seq
c )

, G(x) = (x/τa + 1/τb)

The constraint that the cycle must close leads to conditions on the polarizations S1 and S2

and on the minimum cycle time τc,min. Eqs. (2.27) shows that both S1 and S2 are bounded

by Seq

h and Seq

c . The minimum cycle time is obtained when the polarizations coincide with

the hot bath polarization: S1=S2=Seq

h . In this case, τh=0, and from Eqs. (2.19) and (2.28)

the minimum time allocation on the cold bath τc,min is computed,

or

xmax =

(Seq
h − Seq
(Seq
h − Seq

c ) − σ2/τb
c ) + σ2/τa

τc,min = − 1/Γc lg

(Seq
h − Seq
(Seq
h − Seq

c ) − σ2/τb
c ) + σ2/τa

(2.29)

(2.30)

From this expression for τc,min the lower bound for the overall cycle time, is obtained (The

left of Fig. 3) :

τ ≥ τmin = τc,min + τa + τb

(2.31)

14

When the minimum cycle time Eq. (2.30) diverges, the cycle cannot be closed. This condi-

tion imposes an upper bound on the friction coeﬃcient σ

or

σ ≤ σup = q τb(Seq

h − Seq
c ).

τb > τb,min =

σ2
h − Seq
c )

(Seq

.

(2.32)

(2.33)

Closing of the cycle imposes similar constraints on the minimal cycle time under friction

for the heat pump. The value of the polarization diﬀerence S2 − S1 using the notation of
Fig. 2 becomes:

S2 − S1 = (Seq

2 − Seq

1 )F (x, y) −

σ2(1 − x)(y/τa + 1/τb)

(1 − xy)

(2.34)

The minimum cycle time is calculated in the limit when τc=0, leading to S2=S1=Seq

2 . From

Eqs. (2.19) and (2.34) the minimum time allocation on the hot branch τh,min is computed:

ymax =

2 − Seq
(Seq
(Seq
2 − Seq

1 ) − σ2/τb
1 ) + σ2/τa

τh,min = − 1/Γh lg

2 − Seq
(Seq
(Seq
2 − Seq

1 ) − σ2/τb
1 ) + σ2/τa

,

(2.35)

(2.36)

where Seq
2

is point F and Seq
1

is point E on Fig. 2. Using τh,min the lower bound for the

overall cycle time, is computed

τ ≥ τmin = τh,min + τa + τb

(2.37)

Closing the cycle imposes a minimum cycle time for both the heat engine and the heat pump,

which is a monotonically increasing function of the friction coeﬃcient σ. The divergence of

τmin imposes a maximum value for the friction coeﬃcient σ.

D. Finite Time Analysis

1. Quantities to be Optimized.

The primary variable to be optimized is the power of the heat engine and the heat-ﬂow

extracted from the cold reservoir of the heat pump. For a preset cycle time, optimization

of the power is equivalent to optimization of the total work, while optimization of heat ﬂow

is equivalent to the optimization of the heat absorbed. The entropy production will also be

analyzed.

The total work of the engine, is the sum of the work on each branch: Cf. (Table I and

Fig. 1):

Wcyle1 = I DW = − (WAB + WBC + WCD + WDA)

which becomes:

Wcyle1 = (ωb − ωa)(S1 − S2) − σ2ωa(1/τa + 1/τb)

(2.38)

(2.39)

The negative sign is due to the convention of positive W when work is done on the system.
Analyzing Eq. (2.39), the work is partitioned into three positive and negative areas. The

positive area (left rotation)

Wp = (ωb − ωa)(S1 − S2)

(2.40)

is deﬁned by the points A, B, C 1, D1 in Fig. 1. The two negative areas (right rotation)

Wn = σ2ωa(1/τa) + σ2ωa(1/τb)

(2.41)

are deﬁned by the points C, C 1, S1, S3 and D1, D, S4, S2 in Fig. 1.

The cycle which achieves the minimum cycle time τ = τc,min, produces zero positive work
Wp = 0. The corners A and B coincide at E, and C 1 coincides with D1. The negative work
of Eq. (2.41), is deﬁned by the corners C, D, S4, S3 and is ’cut’ by the Seq
h line (Cf. the right

of Fig. 4). The cycle has negative total work, meaning that work is done on the working

ﬂuid against friction. When τ increases beyond τc,min , S1 diverts from S2, becoming lower

16

than Seq
h

(Cf.Eq. (2.27)). At a certain point, the work done against friction is exactly

balanced by the useful work of the engine. The minimum time in which this balance is

achieved is designated τ0. Its value which can be deduced from Eq. (2.39) is worked out in

appendix B.

The minimum cycle time τmin is compared to τ0, the minimum time needed to obtain

positive power shown in the right of Fig. 3 as a function of the friction σ. Both functions

increase with friction, but τ0 diverges at a much lower friction parameter. Above this

friction parameter no useful work can be obtained from the engine. The divergence of τmin

corresponds to a larger friction value where the cycle cannot be closed.

When the total time allocation is suﬃcient, i.e. τ > τ0, work is done on the environment,

and S1 starts to increase. For long cycle times S1 will approach Seq

h , while S2 will approach

Seq

c . The constant negative area will become negligible in comparison to the positive area (

The emergence of positive power P is shown in Fig. 4. For a ﬁxed cycle time the

optimization of work is equivalent to the optimization of power.

The ﬁrst two cycles have a cycle time shorter than τ0, and therefore do not produce

useful work. For cycle 3, τ > τ0 and positive work is obtained when the time allocation on

the cold bath is suﬃcient τc ≥ 0.08.

(2) The heat-ﬂow(QF )
The heat-ﬂow, QF , extracted from the cold reservoir is:

QF = ωa(S2 − S1)/τ

(2.44)

Due to the dependence of QF only on S2-S1, the cycle is similar to the cycle of the heat

engine.

(3) The entropy production (∆Su).
The entropy production of the universe, ∆Su, is concentrated on the boundaries with

19

the baths since, for a closed cycle, the entropy of the working ﬂuid is constant. The compu-

tational details for both the heat engine and the heat pump are shown in appendix C. The

entropy production and the power have a reciprocal relation (See Fig. 12). For example,

the entropy production increases with σ, while the power decreases.

(4) Eﬃciency.

The eﬃciency of the heat engine is the ratio of useful work to the heat extracted from

the hot bath.

allocation, cycle time, and bath temperatures.

2. Optimization

The performance of both the heat engine and the heat pump can be optimized with

respect to:

• (a) The overall time period τ of the cycle, and its allocation between the hot and cold

branches.

• (b) The overall optimal time allocation between all branches. (This optimization is

performed only for the heat pump.)

• (c) The external ﬁelds, (ωa, ωb).

(a) Optimization with respect to time allocation.

The optimization of time allocation is carried out with the constant ﬁelds ωa and ωb.

The Lagrangian for the work output becomes:

L(x, y, λ) = Wcycle + λ(cid:18)τ +

1
Γc

ln(x) +

1
Γh

ln(y) − τa − τb(cid:19) ,

(2.50)

where λ is a Lagrange multiplier. Equating the partial derivatives of L(x, y, λ) with respect
to x and y to zero, the following condition for the optimal time allocation becomes:

Γc x ((1 − y)2(Seq
Γh y ((1 − x)2(Seq

h − Seq
h − Seq

c ) + σ2(1 − y)(1/τa + y/τb)) =
c ) − σ2(1 − x)(x/τa + 1/τb))

(2.51)

When σ = 0, the previous frictionless result is retrieved. (Optimizing the entropy pro-

duction ∆Su leads to an identical time allocation to Eq. (2.51)).

Eq. (2.51) can also be written in the following way:

Γc x ((1 − y)(1 − y xmax)) = Γh y ((1 − x)(xmax − x))

(2.52)

where xmax was deﬁned in Eq. (2.29). The result is dependent on the time allocations of

the ’adiabats’, through the dependence of xmax.

For the special case when Γc = Γh, the relation between the time allocations in contact

with the hot and cold baths becomes:

21

x = xmax y

(2.53)

For the frictionless case, this result coincides with the former frictionless onex = y, meaning

that equal time is allocated to contact with the cold and hot reservoirs. When friction is

added this symmetry is broken, Eq. (2.53), to compensate for the additional heat generated

by friction the time allocated to the cold branch, becomes larger than the time on the hot

branch.

The Lagrangian for the heat-ﬂow, QF , extracted from the cold reservoir is deﬁned in
parallel to the Lagrangian for the total work. Substituting Γh for Γc, x for y and vice versa,

also ymax for xmax, where ymax was deﬁned in Eq. (2.35), one gets the optimal time allocation

for the heat pump.

Optimization of power with respect to time allocation as a function of the cycle time, τ

for diﬀerent friction coeﬃcients is shown in Fig. 6 (Left), together with the corresponding

heat-ﬂow (Middle) and the corresponding entropy production (Right). The left part shows

that in the frictionless case the power obtains its maximum at zero cycle time with the value

consistent with Eq. (2.58). When friction is introduced, the maximum power decreases and

is shifted to longer cycle times. The ﬁgure also shows, that for short times the work done

by the system is negative, and as the friction coeﬃcient σ increases, the boundary between

positive and negative power shifts to longer cycle times. In the Middle of Fig. 6, the heat-

ﬂow corresponding to the optimal power on the left is shown. The shapes of the power and

heat ﬂow curves are similar. The heat-ﬂow values are always positive and larger than the

corresponding power values. The entropy production (Right) shows that unlike the power

curves the friction changes signiﬁcantly the shape of the curves. The entropy production

rate for the case with friction sharply decreases. The parallel graphs for the heat pump are

similar.

curves from plot 3 to plot 7 are: 0.002, 0.005, 0.007 0.0135, 0.02 accordingly.

(b) Time allocation optimization between all branches of the refrigerator

Further optimization of the performance of the heat pump is possible by relaxing the

assumption of constant time on the ’adiabats’. First the time allocation between the two

’adiabats’ is optimized, when τa + τb = δ, where δ is a constant. Finally the time allocation

between the ’adiabats’ and the heat exchange branches, is optimized. These results are

compared to the recent analysis of Gordon et. all. [27].

From Eqs.

(2.44) and (2.34) with constant time allocations along the heat exchange

branches one gets for the cooling power:

QF = A0 − A1(

y
τa

+

1

(δ − τa)

)

,

(2.54)

where A0 and A1 are constant functions of the parameters of the system. And on δ, a double

inequality is imposed τ > δ > the larger of [ (τ − τh,min); τb,min], see Eq. (2.33).
The optimal τa depends only on y and on δ. The optimal value of τa,opt becomes:

τa,opt = δ−y + √y
1 − y

23

(2.55)

t
t
t
D
Further optimization by changing the the value of δ, changes the cycle time τ . This

optimization step is done by numerical iteration. Typically the sum of the ﬁnal optimal

values of τa and τb is about twice their value before, and their ratio is about 0.7 of the value

which was chosen initially.

The next step is to study the time allocation between the ’adiabats’ and the heat exchange

branches when all other controls of the heat pump have optimal values. These controls

include also the external ﬁelds of optimization which are described later.

For comparison with Gordon et. all. [27], the results of optimization are plotted in the

1/QF ,1/η plane for a ﬁxed cycle time τ . The following example demonstrates the method
followed: First an optimal starting value for QF was found which determines the time
allocation control parameters, τc = 0.44221, τh = 0.31779, τa = 0.0084, τb = 0.0116 with

a total cycle time of τ = 0.78. Under such conditions QF,max = 2.9158 (1/QF,max = 0.34296).
Changing the time allocation between the ’adiabats’ and the heat exchange branches

changes the balance between optimal cooling power and eﬃciency. Denoting the sum τc+τh

by τch, the ratio τh/τc by rhc, the sum τa + τb by τab, the ratio τa/τb by rab, time is transfered

from τch by small steps to τab, while keeping the the ratios rhc and rab constant. For each

step the corresponding 1/QF and 1/η, are calculated as in Fig. 7. The relation between
the reciprocal eﬃciency and the reciprocal cooling power shows the tradeoﬀ between losses

due to friction and losses due to heat transfer. Following the curve in Fig. 7, starting from

point A where the cooling power is optimal, resources represented by time allocation are

transferred from the heat exchange branches to the ’adiabats’, reducing the friction losses.

At point B an optimum is reached for the eﬃciency. This point has been found by Gordon

et. al. to be the universal operating choice for commercial chillers. Point B represents the

optimal compromise between maximum eﬃciency and cooling power.

shows the neighborhood of point A.

Point A is located at the maximum cooling power. If more time is allocated to the heat

exchange branches both 1/QF and 1/η will continue to increase as seen in the insert of Fig.
7.

(c) Optimization with respect to the ﬁelds.

The values of the ﬁelds ωa and ωb are control parameters of the engine.

In a spin

system these ﬁelds are equivalent to the value of the external magnetic ﬁeld applied on the

system. They directly inﬂuence the energy spacing of the TLS. The work function Wcycle,
or equivalently the power (P) is optimized with respect to the ﬁelds, subject to the Carnot
constraint:

ωa
Tc ≥

Th

25

(2.56)

Optimal power is obtained by equating independently to zero the partial derivatives of

Wcycle, or of P = Wcycle/τ by varying ωa and ωb. In addition the optimal solutions have
to fulﬁll the inequality constraints in Eq. (2.56). As a result two transcendental equations

in ωa and ωb are obtained which are solved numerically.

The two equations are:

(1 − y xmax)

(ωb − ωa)

(∆Seq + σ2/τa) cosh2(cid:16) ωa
(ωb − ωa) (∆Seq + σ2/τa) cosh2(cid:16) ωb

1−x

(4 kB Th)

(2.57)

Where ∆Seq= Seq

h - Seq

c as deﬁned in Eq. (2.28). Examining Eq. (2.57), and ﬁxing the

friction σ, it is found that ∆Seq is an extensive function of order zero (intensive ) with

respect to the quartet of variables ωa, Tc, ωb, Th. This means that scaling these parameters

simultaneously will not change ∆Seq. Also xmax, and cosh2(cid:16) ω

2kB T(cid:17) are extensive (order

zero). The work function however, is extensive with order one (Eqs. (2.42) and (2.43)).

This property will be exploited in paragraph III.

The optimization of power with respect to the ﬁelds is shown in Fig. 8 for the frictionless

engine, as a function of the ﬁelds with ﬁxed time allocation. A global maximum can be

identiﬁed.

The heat pump optimization of QF with respect to the ﬁelds is diﬀerent and therefore

will be presented in Section III.

The analysis for the optimization with respect to the ﬁelds for the entropy production
∆Su, is presented in appendix C. The optimal solution without friction(σ = 0) leads to
∆Su
min = 0. When σ 6= 0, the minimum value of ∆Su is diﬀerent from zero, and is achieved
on the boundary of the region.

E. Global Optimization of the Heat Engine

Global optimization of the power means searching for the optimimum with respect to

the control parameters cycle time, time allocation and the ﬁelds. An iterative procedure is

used.

The procedure is initiated by setting the optimal time allocation from the corresponding

Lagrangian, with σ = 0. The power becomes a product of two functions, one depending only

on time the other only on the ﬁelds, and therefore, the ﬁelds can be changed independently of

time. The optimal ﬁelds for the above time allocation are then sought. For the frictionless

case, the overall time on the adiabats tends to zero. The optimal ﬁeld values become

independent of time. The value P = 107.501 is the short time limit in accordance with the
equation:

P −→ (ωb − ωa)(Seq

h − Seq

c )(ΓcΓh)/(qΓc +qΓh)2

(2.58)

These ﬁelds are inserted into the expression with friction σ 6= 0, and the new optimal
times and ﬁelds are computed. The iteration converges after two to three steps, as indicated

by Table III for σ = 0.005. Notice that the location of the optimum is not very sensitive to

the friction parameter.

III. ASYMPTOTIC PROPERTIES OF THE HEAT PUMP WHEN THE COLD

BATH TEMPERATURE APPROACHES ABSOLUTE ZERO.

The goal is to obtain an asymptotic upper bound on the cooling power when the heat

pump is operating close to absolute zero temperature. This requires optimizing the perfor-

mance of the heat pump with respect to all control parameters.

A. Optimization of the heat-ﬂow QF with respect to the ﬁelds and to the cooling

power upper bound.

The heat-ﬂow,QF extracted from the cold reservoir now becomes the subject of interest:

QF = ωa(S2 − S1)/τ

or from Eq. (2.34),

QF = (ωa/τ ) (Seq

2 − Seq

1 )F (x, y) −

σ2(1 − x)(y/τa + 1/τb)

(1 − xy)

!

(3.1)

(3.2)

No global maximum for the QF with respect to the ﬁelds is found. The derivative of QF

with respect to ωb becomes:

∂QF
∂ωb

=

F (x, y) ωa

1

τ

4 kB Th cosh2

ωb

2 kB Th

≥ 0

(3.3)

leading to the result that QF is monotonic in ωb. Under such conditions, ωb is set, and the
optimum with respect to ωa is sought for. The derivative of QF with respect to ωa becomes:

∂QF
∂ωa

= (Seq

σ2

(1 − y)

(y/τa + 1/τb) − ωa

4 kB Tc cosh2

(3.4)

Introducing from Eq. (3.4) the optimal value of (Seq

2 − Seq

1 ) − σ2

(1−y) (y/τa + 1/τb), into Eq.

(3.2), leads to the optimal cooling rate:

Due to its extensivity, the ratio ωa

becomes a constant, while both ωa and Tc can

approach zero.

From Eq.(3.5), an upper-bound for the cooling rate QF is obtained:

Qoptimum

F

≤

F (x, y)
4 kB τ

Tc (cid:19)2
(cid:18) ωa

(3.6)

From Eqs. (3.6), when Tc approaches zero, the cooling rate vanishes, at least linearly with

temperature. This is a third law statement which shows that absolute zero cannot be reached

since the rate of cooling vanishes as absolute zero is approached.

B. The asymptotic relation between the internal and external temperature on the

cold branch

When the bath temperature tends to zero, the internal working ﬂuid temperature has to

follow. This becomes a linear relationship between T ′ and Tc as Tc tends to zero.

Calculating the polarization at the end of the contact with the cold bath S2:

S2 = Seq

2 −

(Seq

2 − Seq

1 )x(1 − y) − σ2x(1/τb + y/τa)

(1 − xy)

(3.7)

Assuming the relation Th = ρ Tc as Tc tends to zero, the exponents can be expanded to the

ﬁrst order to give:

S2 =

Tc
ωa

1 − xymax + (ωa/ωb)ρx(ymax − y)

(1 − xy)
Also, S2 deﬁnes the internal temperature T ′ through the relation: S2 = − 1
Expanding the hyperbolic tangent, one gets:

(1 − xy)

+ 1/2 −

x(σ2/τa)(ymax − y)

(3.8)

2 tanh(cid:16) ωa

2kBT ′(cid:17) .

T ′ = Tc

1 − xymax + ρ(ωa/ωb)x(ymax − y)

(1 − xy)

−

xωa(σ2/τa)(ymax − y)

(1 − xy)

(3.9)

proving that Tc and T ′ both tend asymptotically to zero. It should be noted that the term

independent of Tc depends on ωa, which also tends to zero as Tc tends to zero ( (Eq. 3.6).
Eq. (3.6) also shows that Qoptimum

*Tc is a quadratic function of ωa, Cf. Fig. 9.

F

30

Eq. (3.6) represents an upper-bound to the rate of cooling. In order to determine how

closely this limit be approached, a strategy of cooling must be devised, which re-optimizes

the cooling power during the changing conditions when Tc approaches zero.

C. Optimal cooling strategy

The goal is to follow an optimal cooling strategy, which exploits the properties of the

equations and achieves the upper-bound for the rate of cooling, QF .

The properties of the equations employed are;

• i: The derivative with respect to ωa of QF ( Eq. (3.4)), is extensive of order zero in

the ’quartet’ (ωa, ωb, Tc, Th).

• ii: For ∂QF

∂ωa

the extensivity holds also for the ’doublets’ (ωb , Th) or (ωa , Tc). Scaling

these variables by the same number, leaves Eq. (3.4) equal to zero, and the value of
Qoptimum

does not change.

F

• iii: In spite of QF being monotonic in ωb, Qoptimum

F

is independent of ωb (and of Th),

therefore QF saturates as ωb is increased.

From property (i) it follows, that once an optimal ’quartet’(ωa, ωb, Tc, Th) is created, it

is possible to cool optimally with a set of quartets, which are scaled by a decreasing set

rn < 1, limn→∞ rn = 0. For this set the limit of the ratio ωa
Tc

is a non zero constant.

Therefore in Eq. (3.5) ωa and TC are optimal leading to:

Qoptimum

F

=

F (x, y)

Tc,optimal!2
4 kB τoptimal   ωa,optimal

Tc,optimal

cosh2

ωa,optimal

2 kB Tc,optimal

(3.10)

In general, the hot bath temperature is constant, and the property (ii) is used to scale

back the value of the optimal Th to the bath temperature. As a result, the optimal high

ﬁeld is also scaled.

Property (iii) will be exploited by changing only ωb in the optimal quartets and checking

for saturation. See Fig. 13 and the dashed curves of Fig. 9. Summarizing, for every ’quartet’

31

the upper-bound in Eq. (3.6) can be reached. The details of the cooling strategy can be

found in Appendix E

ωb = 150, 120, 100, 70, 55, 40, 10, 2, 0.4, 0.04. The other constant parameter values are: σ = 0.005,

Γc = 1, Γh = 2. (dashed line): ﬁxing ωb = 3000 for every point. The other parameters are the

same as the solid line. Right: The optimal heat-ﬂows multiplied by the corresponding Tc as a

function of ωa. The optimal time is constant for the chosen parameters; τoptimal = 0.885 for the

solid curves, and 0.825 for the dashed curves.

Fig. 10 shows that the cooling strategy ( Tables V and VI ) can approach the upper

bound leading to a linear relation of the optimal cooling power with temperature. With

respect to the ﬁelds the optimal strategy leads to a decrease of the ﬁeld ωa which is in

contact with the cold bath. This causes the internal temperature of the TLS T’ to be lower

than the cold bath temperature Tc. On the hot side the optimal solution requires as large

an energy separation as possible ωa → ∞ but this eﬀect saturates.

The linear relation of the cooling rate with Tc leads to a constant asymptotic entropy

production as can be seen in the right of Fig. 10 ( Cf. Appendix C).

IV. CONCLUSION

The detailed study of the four stroke discrete heat engine with internal friction serves

as a source of insight on the performance of refrigerators at temperatures which are very

close to absolute zero. The next step is to ﬁnd out if the behavior of the speciﬁc heat

pump described in the study can be generalized. A comparison with other systems studied

indicates that the conclusions drawn from the model are generic. As a heat engine the model

shows the generic behavior of maximum power as a function of control parameters found

in ﬁnite time thermodynamics [3–6]. This is despite the fact that the heat transfer laws

in the microscopic model of the working ﬂuid are diﬀerent from the macroscopic laws such

as the Newtonian heat transfer law [16]. When operated as a heat pump with friction, the

present model shows the universal behavior observed for commercial chillers [27] caused by

33

D
a tradeoﬀ between allocating resources to the ’adiabats’ or to the heat exchange branches.

Another question is whether the linear scaling of the optimal cooling power at low cold

bath temperatures is a universal phenomenon. For low temperatures the results of the

present model can be extended to a working ﬂuid consisting of an ensemble of harmonic

oscillators or any N-level systems. This is because at the limit of absolute zero only the two

lowest energy levels are relevant. When examined, other models with diﬀerent operating

cycles show an identical behavior. For example the continuous model of a quantum heat

engine [18] based on reversing the operation of a laser shows this linear scaling phenomena.

Another example is the Ericsson refrigeration cycle Cf. Eq. (23) in the study of Chen et al

[25] which shows the same asymptotic linear relationship.

A point of concern is the dependence of the heat transfer laws on temperature when

absolute zero is approached. The kinetic parameters k↓ and k↑ represent an individual

coupling of the two-level-system to the bath. Considering coeﬃcients derived from gas

phase collisions they settle to a constant asymptotic value as the temperature is lowered

[29]. The reason is that the slow approach velocity is compensated by the increase in the

thermal De-Broglie wavelength.

There has been an ongoing interest in the meaning of the third law of thermodynamics

[30–36]. The issue at stake has been:

is the third law an independent postulate or it is a

consequence of the second law and the vanishing of the heat capacity. This study presents

a dynamical interpretation of the third law. The absolute temperature cannot be reached

because the maximum rate of cooling vanishes linearly at least with temperature.

APPENDIX A: ANALYSIS FOR THE ’MOVING’ CYCLES.

Insight into the origin of the behavior of the ’moving’ cycles is seen in Fig. 11, where the

polarizations S1, S2 are shown as monotonically decreasing functions of the time allocation

on the cold bath. However, the envelope of S1 for maximal power, namely for maximal S1-S2

is worth noticing.

It is a decreasing function for short cycle times, achieves a minimum

at τ0, and starts to increase for τ > τ0. Thus it is responsible for shifting the cycles to

smaller polarization for short cycle times, and for the change of that trend for larger cycle

times. The envelope of S2 for maximal S1-S2 is also a monotonically decreasing function of

τc, or equivalently of τ , supporting the increase of S1-S2. The ﬁgure also shows, that for a

short time allocation both S1 and S2 are close to the equilibrium polarization Seq

h , When not

enough time is allocated on the hot bath both the polarizations S1 and S2 approach Seq

APPENDIX B: THE COMPUTATION OF τ0

The computation of τ0 Eq. (2.39) is not suﬃcient since it gives only the relation be-

tween the times spent on the cold and hot branches for zero work. The natural addi-

tional requirement is to seek for the optimal allocations, τc,0 and τh,0 using Eq.

(2.52):

τ0 = τc,0 + τh,0 + τa + τb

Denoting by x0 and y0 the corresponding x and y values deﬁned in Eq.

(2.19), the

following two equations for x0 and y0 are obtained:

y0 =

(xmax − x0) − R
(xmax − x0) − Rx0

and

Γc x0 ((1 − y0)(1 − y0 xmax)) = Γh y0 ((1 − x0)(xmax − x0))

Where R is deﬁned as:

R =

cold branch for the ﬁxed values of ωa = 1794, ωb = 4238, Tc = 500, Th = 2500, Γc = 1, Γh = 2 and

τ = 0.1. Middle: The corresponding cycles. Right: The corresponding powers. Seven cases are

shown. Case ’00’ is the frictionless case, when the times spent on the ’adiabats’, are zero, case ’01’

is the frictionless case, when the times spent on the ’adiabats’, τa and τb are diﬀerent from zero and

equal: 0.01. The other ﬁve cases are with increasing friction, when also τa = τb = 0.01, whereas

the diﬀerent friction coeﬃcients σ are: for plot 1: σ = 0.003, for plot 2: σ = 0.004,

for plot 3:

σ = 0.005, for plot 4: σ = 0.006 and for plot 5: σ = 0.007.

The reciprocal behavior of the entropy production and the power is clear from Fig. 12.

One also observes, that for the given cycle time the ’free’ time for the cycles with increasing

σ becomes more restricted. This follows from the dependence of τc,min on σ. See also Fig.(

right side of Fig. 10.

The optimization with respect to time allocation has the same result as for the heat

engine. Therefore, only optimization with respect to the ﬁelds are presented;

Equating to zero the derivatives with respect to x an y of the entropy production, one

gets two similar equation to the total work derivatives:

corresponding corners, D,C,B1,A1, B,B1,S2,S3 and A1,A,S4,S1.

APPENDIX E: THE OPTIMAL COOLING STRATEGY CLOSE TO THE

ABSOLUTE ZERO TEMPERATURE

The ﬁrst step in the cooling strategy is to create the ﬁrst optimal quartet;

• (0) The systems external parameters σ, τa, τb, Γc and Γh are set.

39

• (1) A decreasing set of ωb is chosen.

• (2) A constant ratio (ρ) for Th/Tc, is chosen which is the ratio of the initial bath

temperatures.

• (3) For the above chosen values, the optimal values of ωa, Tc, τ , and its optimal
allocations between the branches to give maximal QF are found for each ωb in the set

in (1) , by solving numerically the following additional equation to Eq. (3.4), with the

condition that Th = ρ·Tc:

(E1)

The above strategy causes the decrease of Th together with the Tc. Nevertheless according

to (ii) above, the doublet ωb and Th can be rescaled to increase Th back to its original value.

The solid curves of Fig. 9 are optimal in the in the above described sense. Increasing only

the value of ωb in the optimal quartet according to point (iii), leads to larger values of the

cooling rate, but eventually the increase of QF will slow down and saturate. See Fig. 13
and the dashed curves of Fig. 9.

Fig. 13 represents the saturation phenomenon on ωb. Three points from Fig. 9 are

chosen, and all parameters are ﬁxed, except ωb, which is allowed to increase.

starting with ωb = 100, for circles; Th = 23.59905, Tc = 4.71981,

ωa = 4.37247,

starting with ωb = 55. The common parameters for all three ﬁgures are:

τa = τb = 0.01, σ = 0.005, Γc = 1, Γh = 2. Right: The optimal heat-ﬂows as a function of

τmax, the time at which the optimum is achieved. The ﬁxed parameter values are the same, as on

the left. We note, that the optimal time is becoming constant only at saturation.

In order to approach the upper-bound for QF in Eq. (3.6), a decreasing set of ωa / Tc is

created, achieved in an optimal way:

First step: After having an optimal ’quartet’, Tc and Th, are ﬁxed. Then, by lowering

ωb, one ﬁnds the corresponding optimal ωa values. This procedure is checked globally, by

also iterating the time allocations. The results of a typical example are shown in Table V.

Second step: Using again the property of extensivity, the cooling will be achieved by

multiplying the rows of Table V by a decreasing sequence, e.g. by 2−n for the n-th row.

Table VI describes the cooling strategy, checking also the non-divergence of the entropy

production both for the frictionless case and the case with friction. The results are also

summarized in Fig. 10.

Abstract

It can be fruitful to view two-component physical systems of attractive

monomers, A and B, “chemically” in terms of a reaction A + B ⇀↽ C, where

C = AB is an associated pair or complex. We show how to construct free en-

ergies in the three-component or chemical picture which, under mass-action

equilibration, exactly reproduce any given two-component or “physical” ther-

modynamics. Order-by-order matching conditions and closed-form chemical

representations reveal the freedom available to modify the A-C, B-C, and

C-C interactions and to adjust the association constant. The theory (in the

simpler one-component, i.e., A

B, case) is illustrated by treating a van der

Introduction and background

The clustering of atoms and molecules in equilibrium is a nearly ubiquitous experimen-

tal phenomenon, occurring even among neutral, symmetric atoms like argon [1,2]. Not

surprisingly, then, theoretical investigation of chemical association has remained a basic

topic in physical chemistry since the work of Dolezalek [3] early this century. Advances

in microscopically-based statistical mechanical descriptions include those of Hill [4] and

Wertheim [5]. Of greater interest here, however, are the more practical “thermodynamic”

approximations, such as those of Heidemann and Prausnitz [6], who proposed a closed-form

analytical approximation embodying all cluster sizes, and of Ebeling [7,8] whose approach for

electrolytes matched exactly known virial coeﬃcients. More recent treatments are discussed

by Anderko [9] and Economou and Donohue [10].

The present discussion is limited to chemical formulations describing only “pairing”

and employing a single association constant K(T )

K2(T ). In the context of electrolyte

≡

theory — which serves to illustrate general characteristics of chemical approximations — the

importance of dipolar pairing was ﬁrst stressed by Bjerrum [11], and has proved crucial [12]

in describing the critical region of the “restricted primitive model” [13,14]. In electrolytes, as

in other systems, one expects cluster-inducing attractions to dominate at low temperatures,

T : loosely speaking, clustering descriptions attempt to represent the partial “saturation” of

such interactions, insofar as clustered particles are supposed to be in close contact.

The theoretical description of the temperature variation of association presents serious

challenges and entails basic restrictions on the form of the association constant [12–15]. As

T rises and excluded-volume eﬀects dominate the thermodynamics, one expects heuristically

the degree of clustering to drop and eventually to vanish at high T . However, with Lee [12]

we have recently shown that electrolyte pairing theories with association constants, K(T ),

which vanish at high T yield negative speciﬁc heats and so violate thermodynamic convexity

requirements (resting on the Second Law of Thermodynamics [16]) for signiﬁcant regimes of

temperature and density, ρ. Moreover, the underlying mechanism [12,15] proves not speciﬁc

to electrolyte theories. On the other hand, acceptable forms, like the simple expression

2

K(T )

K∞eT0/T , do not vanish at high T ; but the resulting ﬁnite value, K = K∞ when

, then imposes some residual pairing even when repulsive forces totally dominate.

≡

T

→ ∞

Chemical descriptions employing appropriate expressions for K(T ) are, therefore, forced to

accommodate pairing even for hard-core particles at inﬁnite temperature!

A pairing description of hard-core particles, in addition to seeming rather unphysical,

is not easy to accomplish accurately. Consider a model of attractive, spherical monomers,

A and B, with hard-core repulsions. A fairly good “physical” equation of state for the

monomers when T

is provided by the Carnahan-Starling (CS) theory and its extensions

→ ∞

[17,18]. However, once C = AB pairs are also considered to be present in mass-action

equilibrium at high T , as implied by K∞ = K(T

) > 0, no comparably accurate

→ ∞

chemical hard-core descriptions seem available. (See [15] for further details.)

These considerations lead to the basic question addressed here: “How can one incorporate

into an associative or chemical framework as much of the exact thermodynamics as is reliably

known, in a tractable way that does not violate thermodynamic convexity requirements?”

In particular, one wants to maintain the accuracy of the monomeric repulsive-core physics

without violating thermodynamic principles; but also desires to incorporate known virial

or high-T expansions.

In all cases, one hopes to beneﬁt at low temperatures from the

associative, chemical description which, at least at lower densities, becomes increasingly

realistic. (See, e.g., [14].)

In pursuit of these goals, we have studied systems consisting of two distinct monomeric

species, A and B, which are assumed to interact via short-ranged or van der Waals, but not

necessarily pairwise-additive, forces. Such systems are approached in two ways: (i) via a

“direct,” “monomeric,” or “physical” picture, in which the thermodynamics are given solely

in terms of the temperature, T , and the two monomeric number densities ρa and ρb; and (ii)

in terms of an “associative,” “pairing,” or “chemical” picture where the thermodynamics

are speciﬁed using three densities, namely, ρa and ρb for the “free species,” and ρc for

the associated pairs, “complexes,” or “two-particle clusters,” C, along with a mass action

3

law relating the equilibrium densities corresponding to the reaction A + B ⇀↽ C. Most of

the principles developed will apply also to ionic ﬂuids; the analysis simpliﬁes in the one-

component case where A

B and C = A2 [15].

≡

We show how to match the chemical and physical descriptions explicitly and ex-

actly. More concretely, given a “physical” Helmholtz free energy density ¯f (T ; ρa, ρb)

≡
A(T ; ρa, ρb)/kBT V for a monomeric system of volume V , we demonstrate how to construct

−
a chemical three-component free energy density, ¯f+(T ; ρa, ρb, ρc), which — when minimized

with respect to the adjustable pair density, ρc, for a given association constant, K(T ) — pre-

cisely reproduces the thermodynamics implied by ¯f . To express this fundamental matching

criterion analytically, let ρeq

ρc(T ; ρa, ρb) denote the equilibrium pair density determined

c ≡

via the appropriate mass-action law [i.e., by matching chemical potentials or minimizing

A+(T ; ρa, ρb, ρc)]: then the desired relation is

¯f+(T ; ρa, ρb, ρeq

c ) = ¯f (T ; ρa + ρeq

c , ρb + ρeq

c ).

(1)

Although the concept of this precise equivalence is not new (see, e.g., [4,7,8,19,20]) we are

unaware of any similar explicit and exact results for chemical pictures employing only pairs.

One might feel that if the physical thermodynamics are already known, seeking an equiv-

alent pairing description is of purely academic interest and of little practical use (beyond

surmounting the high-temperature diﬃculties discussed above). Our primary hope, however,

is that the analytical prescriptions discovered may be used as tools and guides for incor-

porating information that is known exactly or reliably (for example, in terms of some well

understood reference system) into approximate associative thermodynamic descriptions. In-

deed, we are applying the methods to studying the restricted primitive model of electrolytes

and its extensions [21].

2. Physical and chemical thermodynamics

The “physical” thermodynamics are given solely in terms of the monomer densities ρa

and ρb which, for clarity, we call u and v, respectively, so that the overall monomer density

4

is just ρ = u + v. The free energy density in d spatial dimensions can then be written

¯f(T ; u, v) = u[1

ln (Λd

au)] + v[1

ln (Λd

bv)]

F (T ; u, v),

−

−

−

(2)

where we suppose that the excess free-energy density, F , embodies the “true thermodynam-

ics” which the chemical picture must match. As usual, Λa(T ) and Λb(T ) denote the standard

thermal de Broglie wavelengths. For the most part, the temperature dependences will not

be displayed since the basic manipulations will be performed at ﬁxed T .

In the “chemical” or associative picture,

the overall monomer density is now

ρ = u + v + 2w, where w

ρc is the pair or cluster density. Correspondingly, we intro-

≡

duce the augmented or chemical (reduced) Helmholtz free-energy density via

¯f+(T ; u, v, w) = u[1

ln (Λd

au)] + v[1

ln (Λd

bv)] + w

where, to ensure consistency with the classical momentum integrals in the direct partition

function, we suppose Λc = √ΛaΛb [14]. Notice that the association constant, K(T ), appears

here in the role of the internal partition function of an AB

C pair [13,14,22]; for the

≡

present purposes, however, K(T ) may be supposed arbitrary.

Now, the excess chemical free-energy density may be decomposed according to

¯f Ex
+ (u, v, w) =

F (u, v)

uvE(u, v)

wD(u, v, w),

−

−

−

where the ﬁrst term,

F (u, v), represents just the physical-picture excess free energy which

−

must be recovered in the absence of association, i.e., when w

0. Then, the “aug-

ρc →

≡

mented monomer-interaction function,” E(u, v), represents the modiﬁcations to the A-B

interactions inherent in the association process [4]. Finally, the “cluster-interaction func-

tion,” D(u, v, w), embodies the cluster-monomer, A-C and B-C, and cluster-cluster, C-C,

interactions that must be introduced.

The condition of chemical equilibrium under the reaction A + B ⇀↽ C follows in standard

fashion [by equating the chemical potentials or by minimizing

¯f+(T ; u, v, w)] leading to the

Of course, (5) represents a highly nonlinear equation which is normally quite intractable.

3. Matching via virial expansions

The free energies for both the physical and chemical pictures may be expanded in powers

of monomer and pair densities which permits the establishment of order-by-order matching

conditions. (Compare with [19].) One may iteratively solve the mass action relation (5)

to obtain the solution w = weq(u, v) formally to any desired order. An expansion of the

fundamental matching relation (1) solely in terms of u and v may then be obtained by the

substitution w

weq. The nth order matching conditions result from equating coeﬃcients

⇒

of uqvn−q (for all permissible q) in the expansion (1).

Letting Flm, Elm, and Dlmk represent the coeﬃcients of ulvm in F and uvE, and of

ulvmwk in wD, respectively [see (4)], we ﬁnd, for the two lowest orders,

n = 2 :

n = 3 :

E11 = K,

E21 + KD101 = 1

2 K 2 + K(2F20 + F11),

E12 + KD011 = 1

2 K 2 + K(2F02 + F11).

The higher-order relations for both the two- and single-component (A

B) cases have a

≡

completely analogous structure and have been obtained explicitly up to n = 5 [15].

These relations reveal physically signiﬁcant features of the chemical picture. The lowest

order relation (7) — which is implicit, if not more-or-less explicit in much previous work,

e.g. [4,7,14,19,22,23] — admits no adjustable parameters, assuming K is speciﬁed. Since K

must be positive, it implies that the chemical A-B second virial coeﬃcient (the coeﬃcient

6

of uv in p/kBT ) B110 = F11 + E11, increases relative to its “bare” value, B11 = F11, in the

physical picture. In other words, the original A-B interactions must become more repulsive

in the chemical picture.

In next order the relations reveal the freedom implicit in the formulation: thus in (8),

only the combination (E21 + KD101) is constrained to match the physically speciﬁed, lower-

order terms on the right-hand side. Consequently, the A-C monomer-cluster interaction,

which is “encoded” in the second virial coeﬃcient D101, can be chosen arbitrarily; likewise,

the B-C interaction.

In nth order on ﬁnds [15], similarly, that one may choose all the

cluster interaction coeﬃcients Dlmk (and hence the C-C interactions, the A-B-C three-body

coupling, etc.) arbitrarily by ﬁxing the corresponding modiﬁcations of the bare monomer

interactions as embodied in the n

1 coeﬃcients Elm with l, m

1, l + m = n [15].

4. Exact closed-form chemical formulation

The latitude discovered in the chemical formulations may, it transpires, be exploited to

construct exact, closed-form chemical representations for arbitrary physical thermodynam-

ics. In particular, the solution of the intractable mass-action relation (5) may be side-stepped

at a comparatively small cost in ﬂexibility [15]. To this end, let us focus on the excess chem-

ical potential diﬀerence, M(u, v, w), given by (6). If the mass-action equation (5) had been

solved for w = weq(u, v) — given the interaction functions F, E, and D in (4) — one could

explicitly ﬁnd M as a function only of u and v. This suggests that we may choose, at our

discretion, a “solved” chemical potential diﬀerence function M0(u, v) [which then represents

the exact equilbrium value of M(u, v, w)] and impose the constraint

(∂u + ∂v) [F (u, v) + uvE(u, v) + wD(u, v, w)]eq −

∂w [wD(u, v, w)]eq = M0(u, v).

(10)

Here we adopt ∂x ≡
weq(u, v) after diﬀerentiation. But weq may now be obtained trivially: by comparing (10) to

∂/∂x and use the subscript “eq” to indicate that one must set w =

(5) and (6), one sees that the mass-action law has, indeed, been solved in closed form giving

just

7

weq(u, v)

Kuv exp [M0(u, v)].

≡

(11)

Now the implications of the constraint (10) are not so obvious; however, it is linear in

M0, F, E, and D and, consequently, one ﬁnds [15] that much freedom remains explicitly

available. In particular, it proves convenient to specify the cluster-interaction function, D,

by choosing the “component functions,” D1 and D2, in the form

D(u, v, w) = D0(u, v)D1(u, v, w) + D2(u, v, w).

(12)

Physically reasonable and eﬀective choices for D1 and D2 are discussed below. The remaining

“coeﬃcient” D0(u, v), and the augmented monomer interaction function, E(u, v), can then

be expressed simply in terms of F, M0, D1, and D2: see the Appendix.

Once D0(u, v) and E(u, v) are calculated via the straightforward prescription in the

Appendix, the exact chemical description is complete: minimizing the free energy (3) with

respect to w (i.e., ρc) should now precisely reproduce the original thermodynamics embodied

in F (u, v), the physical free energy.

5. Faithfulness of the exact representations

Although the closed-form solutions for the chemical free energies constructed in the

previous section are formally exact, one can ask: “Do they actually work?” To answer

this question, consider, for simplicity, a one-component system (A

B) undergoing the

≡

reaction 2A ⇀↽ C (although similar considerations apply to the A + B ⇀↽ C system). Given

a chemical free energy, ¯f+(u, w), the task of ﬁnding equilibrium solutions ueq(ρ) and weq(ρ)

for a ﬁxed overall monomer density ρ = u + 2w, can be phrased as seeking the minimum

chemical free energy at ﬁxed ρ. Now the exact chemical formulation in Sec. 4 guarantees

that the mass-action law (5) is satisﬁed (with v

u); but that ensures only that ¯f+(u, w)

has an extremum on the required locus w = Ku2eM0(u) [see (11)].

It is not guaranteed,

however, that this extremum is a free-energy minimum, let alone the global minimum, as

essential for a sensible chemical description.

≡

8

Thus one may ﬁnd that not every representation is “faithful” — i.e., exactly reproduces

the original, physical thermodynamics — for all temperatures and densities. One may expect

that the desired physical solution will be the global free-energy minimum (for arbitrary D1

and D2, say) when the densities ρ, w, u (and v) are suﬃciently small; but failures can,

indeed, arise at higher densities for inadequate choices of D.

To illustrate this, consider a one-dimensional ﬂuid of hard rods of length b for which the

physical “excluded-volume” excess free energy is

F EV(u) =

u ln (1

bu).

−

−

(13)

(See, e.g., [14].) To obtain an exact chemical picture with the choice of association constant,

say, K = b, one may try ﬁrst the “minimal representation” generated by the simplest

choice, namely, M0 = 0, D1 = 1, and D2 = 0 in (11) and (12), with D0(u) then determined

by the one-component versions of (A1)-(A7) [15]. Numerical and analytical investigations

reveal, however, that this “minimal” chemical picture remains faithful only up to ρ∗

ρb =

≡

0.26 [15]: for larger densities the global chemical free-energy minimum becomes

ρ/ρmax ≃
totally unphysical!

Nevertheless, we have found that the situation can be easily remedied by using physical

intuition to select a cluster interaction function D1 that reﬂects the hard-core aspects of the

A-C and C-C interactions that one would reasonably expect. Thus, in parallel to (13), the

“excluded-volume” speciﬁcation

HC :

wD1 =

(u + w) ln (1

buu

bww) + u ln (1

buu),

(14)

−

−

−

−

along with D2 = M0 = 0 (as previously) proves very eﬀective. Explicitly, the natural choice

bu = b, bw = 2b is found, by numerical examination, to yield faithful representations up to

ρ∗ > 0.98 for assignments of association constants, K, ranging from 10−4b up to 104b.

Furthermore, fully comparable results are obtained for (d = 1)-dimensional hard-rod

A+B mixtures and, in d = 3 dimensions, for the corresponding Carnahan-Starling [17,18]

hard-sphere “physical” thermodynamics (regarded as exact) [15]. To test and illustrate the

theory further we consider systems with attractive interactions.

6. Application to a van der Waals ﬂuid

The van der Waals (vdW) equation gives a surprisingly good semiquantitative description

of gas-liquid criticality in simple one-component real ﬂuids which, furthermore, is exact in

an appropriate inﬁnite-range limit [24]. The corresponding excess free energy is

F (T, ρ) =

ρ ln (1

bρ)

−

−

−

b(ε/kBT )ρ2,

(15)

with b, ε > 0 so that convenient reduced units are ρ∗ = bρ and T ∗ = kBT /ε. The Boyle
temperature, TB, and critical parameters are then T ∗

B = 1, T ∗

3. See Fig. 1 for

27, ρ∗

c = 8

c = 1

the coexistence curve.

The assignment of an appropriate association constant now calls for some study [15].

The choice K vdW(T ) = b exp (1/T ∗) matches the temperature dependence of the vdW sec-

ond virial coeﬃcient at high T — compare with (7) and Refs. [7,8,12–14,22] — and also

satisﬁes convexity criteria needed (in approximate representations) to avoid the Second-Law

violations referred to above [12,15]. It has been adopted for the tests reported here.

Chemical representations of the vdW thermodynamics (15) can be assessed in terms of

faithfulness boundaries, or loci: for every temperature, T , there will be a density, say ρ0(T ),

up to which a given representation is faithful. As reported for the hard-core models, the

minimal formulation (M0 = D2 = 0, D1 = 1) fares poorly: see plot (a) in Fig. 1. The

results are strongly temperature-dependent below T ∗

0.4 and the critical point lies well

≃

outside the faithful domain!

If one uses the temperature-independent “excluded-volume”

cluster-interaction function D1 that that accounts for A-C and C-C repulsions and proved

so successful for hard rods — namely, (14) with bu = 1

2bw = b — one certainly improves the

behavior at high T ∗: see Fig. 1, plot (b); but below T ∗

B little is gained.

To obtain better results for low T ∗, it is reasonable to introduce attractive (i.e., negative)

terms into D. Embodying these for convenience only in D2(u, v, w), we found that the

natural form in which K(T ) regulates the strength of the attractions, namely,

HCK : wD2(u, w) =

(d21uw + d22w2)K(T ).

(16)

−

10

proves successful. As evident from plot (c) in Fig. 1, imposing only A-C or monomer-

cluster interactions, via the choice d21 = 2, d22 = 0, betters the pure HC representation

signiﬁcantly.

Increasing the A-C coeﬃcient to d21 = 3 yields faithfulness for the full set

of tested temperatures in the range 0.05

and densities 0.01

0.99. The

T ∗ <

≤

∞

ρ∗

≤

≤

simple choice d21 = d22 = 1 with both A-C and C-C attractions also proves faithful for

the entire test set. This last formulation is probably a reasonable starting point for the

chemical description of any model with a choice of association constant that does justice to

the monomer attractions at low T [15].

7. Concluding remarks

The exact chemical representations presented above permit — for the ﬁrst time — pre-

cise thermodynamic characterization of the interactions which must arise in an associative,

A + B ⇀↽ C description of a system of A and B monomers. While monomer-monomer inter-

actions are modiﬁed repulsively (since “paired” conﬁgurations are not permitted ) success-

ful, i.e., faithful, chemical prescriptions explicitly incorporate both repulsive and attractive

monomer-pair and pair-pair interactions. The use of just one representative or dominant

type of cluster (i.e., pairs) clearly aﬀects the nature of the required interactions: the pairs

must, in eﬀect, stand in for clusters of all sizes and, at higher densities, may therefore be

viewed as “renormalized,” “dressed,” or “solvated” as discussed in [15]. Except at low den-

sities, therefore, pairs cannot act simply as literal two-body objects if the true “physical” or

monomeric thermodynamics are to be accurately described.

We hope that the exact chemical formulations will prove useful in developing improved

associative approximations for systems with attractive forces. The explicit chemical repre-

sentations found for hard-core reference systems should be of direct use in combination with

existing associative approximations for attractions. Enforcing the matching relations of Sec.

3, moreover, might further reﬁne such theories. On a slightly diﬀerent tack — starting from

scratch and drawing solely on the “thermodynamic” conception of pairs presented here —

11

a worthwhile minimal approximation scheme might combine (i) an exact chemical formu-

lation for a reference thermodynamics with (ii) known, low-order virial coeﬃcients as the

only further input. But regardless of the success of particular formulations, knowledge of

the exact chemical expressions for simple attractive systems — which reproduce the known

thermodynamics of, say, one-dimensional models or a van der Waals ﬂuid — may usefully

inform the construction of approximate chemical free energies for less tractable systems.

Applications to electrolyte models are underway [21].

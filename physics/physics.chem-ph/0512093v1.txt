Rotational transitions in molecular hydrogen collisions are computed. The two most recently
developed potential energy surfaces for the H2−H2 system are used from the following works:
1) A.I. Boothroyd, P.G. Martin, W.J. Keogh, M.J. Peterson, J. Chem. Phys., 116 (2002) 666,
ibid. 112, 4465. Cross
and 2) P. Diep, J.K. Johnson, J. Chem. Phys., 113 (2000) 3480;
sections for rotational transitions 00→20, 22, 40, 42, 44 and corresponding rate coeﬃcients are
calculated using a quantum-mechanical approach. Results are compared for a wide range of
kinetic temperatures 300 K ≤ T ≤ 3000 K.

1. INTRODUCTION

The interaction and collision properties of hydrogen molecules, and hydrogen molecular iso-
topes has been of great theoretical and experimental interest for many years [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,
9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24]. Because of the low number of electrons
in the H2−H2 system this is one of the few four-center systems for which the potential energy
surface (PES) can be developed with very high precision. Therefore H2+H2 is a benchmark col-
lision used for testing several dynamic methods such as: semiclassical [ 17], quantum-mechanical
[ 19] or wave packet [ 20] studies. The system may also be useful in improving our understanding
of fundamental processes in few-body molecular dynamics. Additionally, the H2+H2 elastic and
inelastic collisions are of interest in combustion, spacecraft modeling and in clean renewable
energy. Hydrogen gas, in particular, has generated much interest as a energy supplier, see for
example [ 25].

The hydrogen molecule plays an important role in many areas of astrophysics [ 26, 27, 28, 29].
It is the simplest and most abundant molecule in the universe especially in giant molecular
clouds. Energy transfer involving H2 molecules governs the evolution of shock fronts [ 26, 27] and
photodissociation regions (PDRs) in the interstellar medium. Collision-induced energy transfer
between H2 molecules and between H2 and other atoms/molecules is related to an important
astrophysical processes, which is the cooling of primordial gas and shock wave-induced heating in
the interstellar media. To accurately model the thermal balance and kinetics of such important
systems one needs accurate state-to-state rate constants.

It is well known, that experimental measurements of quantum state resolved cross sections
and rates is a very diﬃcult technical problem. On the other hand accurate theoretical data
requires precise PESs and reliable dynamical treatment of the collision processes. The ﬁrst
attempt to construct a realistic full-dimensional ab initio PES for the H2−H2 system was done
in works [ 10, 11], and the potential was widely used in the framework of variaty of methods
and computation techniques.

Because of the immense theoretical and practical beneﬁts associated with the recent hydrogen
fuel issues, the H2−H2 system has been reinvestigated and an accurate interaction potential from
the ﬁrst principles has been developed in work [ 30]. However, in this work the Diep and Johnson
potential energy surface (DJ PES) was extrapolated only for the rigid rotor monomer model
of H2−H2. On the other hand two extensive studies of the H2−H2 PES have been reported
by Boothroyd et al., [ 13, 31]. In these studies the potential energies have been represented at
6101 and 48180 geometries respectively with a large basis set at the multireference conﬁguration
interaction level. The earlier 6101 points were ﬁtted to a six dimensional many-body expansion
form in work [ 14].

In this work we present a comparative study of the global BMKP and DJ PESs for collisions
of rotationally excited H2 molecules. The scattering cross sections and their corresponding rate
coeﬃcients are calculated using a non reactive quantum-mechanical close-coupling approach. In
the next section we will shortly outline the method. Our results and discussion are presented
in Section 3. Conclusions are provided in Section 4. Atomic units (e=me=¯h=1) are used
throughout this work.

2. METHOD

In this section we will brieﬂy present the close-coupling quantum-mechanical approach we
used to calculate our results, speciﬁcally the cross sections and rates in collision of a hydrogen
molecule with another hydrogen molecule. The Schr¨odinger equation for a ab + cd collision in
the center of a mass frame, where ab and cd are linear rigid rotors is

where P ~R is the momentum operator of the kinetic energy of the collision, ~R is the collision
coordinate, M12 is a reduced mass of the pair of two-atomic molecules (rigid rotors in this
model) ab and cd: M12 = (ma + mb)(mc + md)/(ma + mb + mc + md), µ1(2) are reduced masses
of the targets: µ1(2) = ma(c)mb(d)/(ma(c) + mb(d)), ˆr1(2) are the angles of orientation of rotors
ab and cd, respectively, J is total angular momentum quantum number of abcd system and M
is its projection onto the space ﬁxed z axis, V (~r1, ~r2, ~R) is the potential energy surface for the
four atomic system abcd.

The eigenfunctions of the operators Lˆr1(2) in (1) are simple spherical harmonics Yjimi(ˆr). To

general purpose scattering program MOLSCAT [ 32] to solve the coupled radial equations (4).
Additionally, we have tested other propagator schemes included in MOLSCAT. Our calculations
revealed that other propagators can also produce quite stable results.

The log-derivative matrix is propagated to large R-intermolecular distances, since all exper-
imentally observable quantum information about the collision is contained in the asymptotic
behaviour of functions U JM

where kαα′ = 2M12(E + Eα − Eα′)1/2 is the channel wavenumber, Eα(α′) are rotational channel
energies and E is the total energy in the abcd system. The method was used for each partial
wave until a converged cross section was obtained. It was veriﬁed that the results are converged
with respect to the number of partial waves as well as the matching radius, Rmax, for all channels
included in our calculations.

Cross sections for rotational excitation and relaxation phenomena can be obtained directly

We apply the newest PESs from the works [ 30] and [ 31]. The ﬁrst one, DJ PES, is constructed
for the vibrationally averaged rigid monomer model of the H2−H2 system to the complete basis
set limit using coupled-cluster theory with single, double and triple excitations. A four term
spherical harmonics expansion model was chosen to ﬁt the surface. It was demonstrated, that the
calculated PES can reproduce the quadrupole moment to within 0.58 % and the experimental
well depth to within 1 %.

The bond length was ﬁxed at 1.449 a.u. or 0.7668 ˚A. DJ PES is deﬁned by the center-of-mass
intermolecular distance, R, and three angles: θ1 and θ2 are the plane angles and φ12 is the

4

R.A. Sultanov and D. Guster

relative torsional angle. The angular increment for each of the three angles deﬁning the relative
orientation of the dimers was chosen to be 30◦. There are 37 unique conﬁgurations for each
radial separation when the symmetry of the H2−H2 system is considered. In previous works
calculating the potential a much smaller set of angular conﬁgurations designed to represent the
full surface was used. The potential was calculated from only 2.0 to 10.0 ˚A of intermolecular
(center-of-mass) separation with an increment 0.2 ˚A. However, near the potential minimum
which is from 2.7 to 4.5 ˚A the grid spacing is 0.1 ˚A. The functional form of the potential
represents an expansion on Legendre polynomials [ 5].

The second potential, BMKP PES, is a global six-dimensional potential energy surface for two
hydrogen molecules. It was especially constructed to represent the whole interaction region of
the chemical reaction dynamics of the four-atomic system and to provide an accurate as possible
the van der Waals well. The ground state and a few excited-state energies were calculated. The
new potential ﬁts the van der Waals well to an accuracy within about 5% and has an rms error
of 1.43 millihartree relative to the 48180 ab initio energies. For the 39064 ab initio energies that
lie below twice the H2 dissociation energy BMKP PES has an rms error of 0.95 millihartree.
These rms errors are comparable to the estimated error in the ab initio energies themselves. In
the six-dimensional conformation space of the four atomic system the conical intersection forms
a complicated three-dimensional hypersurface. The authors of the work [ 31] mapped out a large
portion of the locus of this conical intersection.

The BMKP PES uses cartesian coordinates to compute distances between four atoms. We
have devised some fortran code, which converts spherical coordinates used in Sec. 2 to the
corresponding cartesian coordinates and computes the distances between the four atoms. In all
our calculations with this potential the bond length was ﬁxed at 1.449 a.u. or 0.7668 ˚A as in
DJ PES.

Now we will present our results for the elastic and inelastic integral cross sections and rate
coeﬃcients for the collision (8). As far as astrophysical applications are concerned, we are
particularly interested in the pure rotational transitions of the H2 molecules.

A large number of test calculations have been done to secure the convergence of the results
with respect to all parameters that enter into the propagation of the Schr¨odinger equation (1).
This includes the intermolecular distance R, the total angular momentum J of the four atomic
system, Nlvl the number of rotational levels to be included in the close coupling expansion and
others (see the MOLSCAT manual [ 32]).

We reached convergence for the integral cross sections, σ(Ekin), in all considered collisions.
In the case of DJ PES the propagation has been done from 2 ˚A to 10 ˚A, since this potential is
deﬁned only for the speciﬁc distances. For the BMKP PES we used rmin = 1 ˚A to rmax = 30
˚A. We also applied a few diﬀerent propagators included in the MOLSCAT program.

Table 1 represents the convergence test results with respect to Jmax, the maximum value of
the total angular momentum, for both the BMKP and DJ PESs. The calculations are limited
to just three values of energy, for the simpler basis set: j1j2=00, 20 and 22, and from lowest
to highest within the considered range of energies. As can be seen the results are stable for
the range of kinetics energies, when Jmax is increased from 80 to 90.
In all our subsequent
production calculations we use Jmax = 80.

It is important to point out here, that for comparison purposes we don’t include the compen-
sating factor of 2 mentioned in [ 9]. However, in Fig. 2 and in our subsequent calculations of
the rate coeﬃcients, kjj′(T ), the factor is included.

In Table 2 we include the results of our test calculations for the various rotational levels j1j2
included in the close coupling expansion.
In these test calculations we used two basis sets:
j1j2=00, 20, 22, 40, 42 with total basis set size Nlvl = 13 and j1j2=00, 20, 22, 40, 42, 44, 60,

transitions and somewhat stable for the highly excited 00→40 transition. Nontheless, for our
production calculations we used the ﬁrst basis set.

The objective of this work is to make reliable quantum-mechanical calculations for diﬀerent
transitions in p-H2+p-H2 collisions and provide a comparative study of the two PESs. The
energy dependence of the state-resolved integral cross sections σj1j2→j′
(Ekin) for the j1 = j2 =
1 = 2, j′
0 → j′
2 = 2 rotational transitions are represented
in Fig. 1 (upper plots) for both the BMKP and DJ PESs respectively. These channels for the
most part inﬂuence the total cross-section of the H2+H2 collision. As can be seen both PESs
provide the same type of the behaviour in the cross section. These results are in basic agreement
with the recent calculations of work [ 20], where the BMKP PES was also applied, but using a
time-dependent quantum-mechanical approach. Our calculation show, that DJ PES generates
higher values for the cross sections, by up to 50%.

lower kinetic energies these transitions are closed by the corresponding energy barriers.

makes the 0 → 4 transition. However the j1 = 0, j2 = 0 → j′
2 = 4 cross section is very
small over the entire energy range considered. The DJ potential energy surface again provides
higher results in the corresponding cross sections. One can note, that for both potentials the

rotational inelasticity is dominated by the 00 → 20 transition.

The integral cross sections for an elastic p-H2+p-H2 collision computed with both PESs are
depicted in Fig. 2. The two cross sections are in reasonable agreement over a wide range of
energies. Again the BMKP PES generates higher values. The diﬀerence becomes even larger
at lower kinetic energies. In the ﬁgure we also provide experimental data from work [ 6]. The
theoretical and the experimental results are in reasonable agreement with each other. This fact
indicates, that the spherical parts of BMKP and DJ PESs are close in shape, which is a very
important attribute for PESs.

The diﬀerences in the cross sections between the two potentials are also reﬂected in the state-
resolved thermal rate constants, as shown in Fig. 3. Again, the BMKP PES underestimates the
rate constant for the 00→ 20 transition, and overestimates those transitions of higher rotational
levels. The near perfect agreement for the 00→ 40 transition is likely accidental. Because of the
highly averaged nature of the rate constant, the diﬀerence is not as conspicuous as in the cross
sections. We have also plotted in the same ﬁgure the rate constants reported previously in work
[ 15], where Schwenke’s PES [ 10] was used.

Finally, our rate constants for 00 → 20, 22, 40 rotational transitions calculated with the DJ
PES at lower temperatures are listed in Table 3 together with the theoretical calculations of
[ 15] and recent experimental results from work [ 23]. As can be seen our rate
Flower et al.
constants k00→20(T ) and k00→22(T ) are close to those of work [ 15]. The experimental results
are higher by about 60% for 50 K and 30 % for 110 K.

4. SUMMARY and CONCLUSIONS

A systematical study of the state-resolved rotational excitation cross sections and rates in
molecular para-/para-hydrogen collisions is completed. A test of convergence and the results
for cross sections and rate coeﬃcients using two diﬀerent potential energy surfaces for the H2−H2
system have been obtained for a wide range of kinetic energies.

Although our calculations revealed, that both PESs can provide the same type of behaviour
in regard to cross sections and rates, there are still signiﬁcant diﬀerences. The DJ potential
overestimates by about 20-40 % the results at even relatively larger kinetic energies. This is
especially true in regard to 00→20 rotational transition, where signiﬁcant diﬀerences at around
300 K are seen in Fig. 3.

Considering the results of these calculations one can conclude that subsequent work is needed
to further improve the H2−H2 PES. Detailed calculations including rotational-vibrational basis
set and comparative analyses using both potentials at low and very low kinetic energies for
o-H2/o-H2 and p-H2/o-H2 excitation-deexcitation collision processes currently are in progress in
our group.

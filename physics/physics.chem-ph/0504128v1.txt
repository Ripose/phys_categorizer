With MgH+ ions as a test case, we investigate to what extent the rotational motion of smaller
polar molecular ions sympathetically cooled into Coulomb crystals in linear Paul traps couples to
the translational motions of the ion ensemble. By comparing results obtained from rotational state-
selective resonance-enhanced photo-dissociation experiments with data from theoretical simulations,
we conclude that the eﬀective rotational temperature exceeds the translational temperature (<
In fact, the
100 mK) by more than two orders of magnitude, indicating a very weak coupling.
experimental results are consistent with the rotational temperature being in thermal equilibrium
with the surrounding environment at ∼300 K.

Molecules which are translationally cold, spatially lo-
calized and internally prepared in speciﬁc states consti-
tute ideal targets for a large variety of investigations, in-
cluding high resolution spectroscopy [1], coherently con-
trolled chemistry [2], state-speciﬁc reaction studies [3, 4]
and molecular internal state control experiments [5].

For atoms such targets have already for years been
available by combining laser cooling techniques with
trapping and, perhaps most spectacularly, been exploited
in quantum logics experiments [6, 7].
It is, however,
extremely diﬃcult to adopt the same techniques for
molecules due to the general lack of closed optical tran-
sitions.
For polar molecules a further complication
arises since the rovibrational degrees of freedom cou-
ple rather eﬃcient to the black body radiation (BBR)
of the surroundings. Recently, various methods that at
least partially approach the ideal situation have, how-
ever, been demonstrated for neutral molecules. These
include photo-association of cold atoms [8], buﬀer gas
cooling of molecules in magnetic traps [9] and decelera-
tion and trapping of dipolar molecules by electrical ﬁelds
[10]. Most recently, even molecular BEC of molecules has
been created [11, 12].

Molecular ions sympathetically cooled [13] through
Coulomb interactions with laser cooled atomic ions in
Penning or RF traps is an alternative route to achieve
a near-ideal experimental situation. Since this method
does not rely on an electric or a magnetic dipole moment
of the molecular ion, it is very generally applicable. So
far, this technique has proven it possible to cool either
single or ensembles of molecular ions into translational
temperatures in the mK-range [14, 15, 16] where they
become part of a Coulomb crystal.

In this Letter, we investigate whether there is a suf-
ﬁcient coupling between the internal degrees of freedom
of polar molecular ions and the external motion of the
ions in a Coulomb crystal to achieve a signiﬁcant sym-
pathetic cooling of the internal states of the molecular
ions. The strategy is to apply two-photon STate-selective

resonance-Enhanced Photo-dissociation (STEP) as a tool
to obtain knowledge of the populations in the various
rotational states and hence determine the eﬀective rota-
tional temperature.

An ensemble of 24MgH+ molecules, which is trans-
lational sympathetically cooled by laser cooled 24Mg+
atomic ions in a linear Paul trap has been chosen as a
test case for many reasons. First, these molecular ions
have previously been found easy to produce and sym-
pathetically cool [15]. Second, the vibrational constant
of 24MgH+ is suﬃciently large that the molecules even
at room temperature will have a 99% vibrational ground
state population, which means that we experimentally
can focus on the rotational degree of freedom. Third,
in order to implement the STEP process it is a great
advantage that precise spectroscopic data are available
for 24MgH+ [17]. Fourth, in order to compare experi-
mental results with theoretical simulations, the 24MgH+
molecule has a suﬃciently simple structure that poten-
tial energy curves and permanent as well as transition
dipole moments can be calculated with good precision
[18, 19]. Finally, the 24MgH+ ion is of atmospheric and
astrophysical interest [20].

In Fig. 1, the energy potential curves of the four lowest
lying spin singlet electronic states of 24MgH+ are shown
together with an indication of states and processes of
relevance to the investigations. The resonant part of the
two-photon STEP process consists of a rotational state-
selective excitation from a state |ν = 0, JiX in the X1Σ
potential to a state |ν′′ = 0, J + 1iA in the A1Σ potential
by a laser ﬁeld ε. The letters in the ket-notation represent
the rotational and vibrational quantum numbers, respec-
tively. From the |ν′′ = 0, J + 1iA state, the molecule can
dissociate nearly exclusively into Mg and H+ via the C
potential curve by absorbing another photon from the ε
ﬁeld. However, with the ﬁeld strengths applied in our ex-
periments, the excited molecule primarily spontaneously
decays back to a vibrational excited state in the electronic
ground state potential X1Σ with a rate ΓE ≈ 3 × 108 s−1.

24MgH+ including various symbols and processes discussed
in the text.

Subsequently, further spontaneous emissions, stimulated
processes due to the coupling to the BBR ﬁeld and tran-
sitions induced by a hypothetical coupling to the external
motion of the ions take place. In Fig. 1, these various
mechanisms are in brief denoted by ΓνJ. Eventually, the
molecule will reach the state |ν = 0, JiX from where it
again can couple strongly to the laser ﬁeld ε.

The experimental setup has previously been described
in Refs. [21, 22]. In short, 24Mg+ ions are produced by
oﬀ-resonance photo-ionization by the pulsed laser ﬁeld ε
indicated in Fig. 1 and trapped in a linear Paul RF trap
[22] situated in a UHV chamber at background pressure
of ∼ 1 × 10−10 torr. The produced 24Mg+ ions are laser-
cooled on the 3s2S1/2-3p2P3/2 transition by two cw laser
beams counter-propagating along the center-axis of the
trap to temperatures below 10 mK where they form a
Coulomb crystal [22]. The two-dimensional projection
images of such crystals are obtained by monitoring the
ﬂuorescence by a CCD camera. A typical projection im-
age of a pure 24Mg+ crystal is shown in Fig. 2(a). The
shape of the real crystal is spheroidal with rotational
symmetry around the dotted line.

The 24MgH+ molecular ions are formed through pho-
tochemical reactions between 24Mg+ ions excited to the
3p2P3/2 state and H2 molecules leaked in the chamber
at partial background pressure of 5 × 10−10 torr for a
few minutes [15]. The produced 24MgH+ molecular ions
are within tens of milliseconds translational sympathet-
ically cooled by the remaining 24Mg+ to a temperature
below 100 mK, and a two-component Coulomb crystal is
formed [15]. As seen in Fig. 2(b), due to dynamical ra-
dial conﬁnement of the ions, the non-ﬂuorescing 24MgH+
molecular ions and the coolant 24Mg+ ions segregate ra-
dially with the lighter mass ions, the 24Mg+ ions, closest
to the rotational symmetry axis [22]. The amount of each
ion species in the crystal can be deduced from the fact
that each species in the trap will have a uniform density

crystal is 1070 µm. (b) A two-component crystal consisting
of ∼ 35% 24Mg+ and ∼ 65% 24MgH+ ions (non-ﬂuorescing).
The crystal is obtained by letting 24Mg+ ions in the crystal in
(a) react with a gas of H2. (c) A nearly pure 24Mg+ crystal

the axis of rotational symmetry.

inversely proportional to its mass and that for crystals
containing two species with a small diﬀerence in mass,
the outer boundary will have a near spheroidal shape
[16, 21, 23]. By determining the volume of the ﬂuorescing
region in Fig. 2(b), we can conclude that this particular
crystal has a relative 24MgH+ content of ∼ 65%.

The laser ﬁeld ε presented in Fig. 1 originates from
a frequency doubled dye laser pumped by a Nd:YAG
laser. The pulse repetition rate is 20 Hz, and the dura-
tion of each pulse is approximately 5 ns. The waist of the
ﬁeld at the trap center is 500 µm, and the peak intensity
was typically of the order of Ipeak ∼ 107 W/cm2, corre-
sponding to a peak power-broadening of the |ν = 0, JiX–
|ν′′ = 0, J + 1iA transitions of ∼ 0.3 cm−1. The spectral
width of each pulse was ∼ 0.25 cm−1, and the center
frequency was calibrated to better than 0.1 cm−1. Dur-
ing the experiments, the center frequency was scanned
0.95 cm−1 at 1 Hz in order to obtain results which are
independent of slow frequency drifts in the laser sys-
tem. The resonance frequencies of the X1Σ(ν = 0, J)–
A1Σ(ν′′ = 0, J + 1) transitions, which are used in our
STEP scheme, are known with a precision of 0.05 cm−1
from Ref. [17].

Before the STEP lasers are applied, the produced
24MgH+ ions are allowed to internally equilibrate for
about one minute, a time long enough to ensure that the
produced molecular ions are in the vibrational ground
state and that any signiﬁcant hypothetical cooling of
the rotational degrees of freedom will be revealed in the
experiments.
In the experiments, crystals like the one
shown in Fig. 2(b) are exposed to the laser pulses while

the normalized amount of 24MgH+ molecular ions are
shown for two STEP experiments where the ε ﬁeld has
been tuned to the resonance of the R-branch transitions
|ν = 0, J = 1iX–|ν′′ = 0, J = 2iA and R(6):
R(1):
|ν = 0, J = 6iX–|ν′′ = 0, J = 7iA, respectively.

In order to derive an estimate for the rotational tem-
perature from the outcome of the STEP experiments,
simulations including various strengths of a hypothetical
sympathetic rotational cooling have been performed. In
the model, this cooling has been accounted for by intro-
ducing an artiﬁcial decay rate from the rotational states J
to J-1 proportional to J. This leads to an eﬀective cooling
rate Γc deﬁned through dErot/dt = −ΓcErot, where Erot
is the average rotational energy. In Fig. 4, the simulated
steady-state rotational temperature of the 24MgH+ ions,
deﬁned as Trot = Erot/kB, is presented as a function of
the cooling rate Γc. In the absence of sympathetic cool-
ing, the rotational distribution is observed to equilibrate
to the temperature of the BBR ﬁeld in the trap region (∼
300 K). It is, however, clear that only a very modest cool-
ing rate Γc (∼ 0.1 s−1) is needed to dramatically change
this situation (see Fig. 4). The steady-state rotational
distributions are the stating points for all simulations of
the photo-dissociating process.

When simulating the time evolution of the photo-
dissociation process, the time scale is broken into two
types of intervals deﬁned by the presence or absence
of the laser pulses. During a laser pulse, the eﬀect of

laser driven transitions between the various rovibrational
states of the X1Σ and A1Σ potential curves is taken
into account by at any time during the pulse assuming
that the various populations are in steady-state with the
instantaneous laser ﬁeld strength and detunings. This
strategy is extremely computational time eﬃcient and in-
troduces only smaller errors. Based on the instantaneous
populations in the A1Σ potential curve, the dissociation
rate via the C1Σ potential curve is determined. During
the laser pulse, spontaneous emission from the populated
A1Σ states to the various rovibrational states of the X1Σ
potential curve is included as well, while rovibrational
transitions within the potential curves are neglected due
to the short time scale of the pulses. Between consec-
utive pulses population redistribution processes among
the rovibrational states in the electronic ground poten-
tial X1Σ are simulated taking into account a hypothetical
sympathetic cooling, spontaneous emissions and interac-
tions with the BBR ﬁeld. Due to the complexity of the
simulations, only the main ideas have been considered
here, but the details will be presented elsewhere Ref. [24].
The ratios between the simulated dissociation rates for
STEP processes via the R(1) and R(6) resonances are
presented in Fig. 5 as a function of the eﬀective rota-
tional temperature obtained by including a certain cool-
ing rate Γc in the calculations. The dissociation rates
have been extracted 10 s after initiation of the photo-
dissociation process where the various populations and
the dissociation rate are simulated to be in steady state
[24]. The chosen dissociation ratio provides a simple ex-
perimental way of distinguishing between low (. 1 K)
and high (& 100 K) rotational temperatures Trot as the
ratio changes drastically for temperatures below ∼ 50 K.

FIG. 5: The ratios between the simulated dissociation rates
for STEP processes via the R(1) and R(6) resonances. The
values of Trot are directly connected to a cooling rate Γc in-
cluded in the simulations (presented in Fig. 4). The curves
represent three diﬀerent peak-intensities of the laser pulses,
whereas the hatched area represents a conservative estimated
range derived from experimental data as those presented in
Fig. 3.

The ratio of dissociation rates is fortunately nearly insen-
sitive to intensity variations. Even a factor of four in the
actual peak intensity does not signiﬁcantly change the
ratio. This indicates that a smaller error in calibration
of the power meter used in the experiments or smaller un-
certainties in the laser beam positioning should not aﬀect
the measured ratio. A conservative estimated interval of
this ratio that is in agreement with a series of experi-
mental data as those presented in Fig. 3 is indicated in
Fig. 5 as the hatched area. From Fig. 5 it is hence
reasonable to conclude that the rotational temperature
of the 24MgH+ ions is higher than 120 K, and likely as
high as room temperature, which is the same rotational
temperature found in storage ring experiments with very
weak coupling between the individual ions [25]. In terms
of the rotational cooling rate Γc, we can correspondingly
conclude that it must be smaller than ∼ 0.1 s−1. Since
the permanent dipole moment of 24MgH+ (3.6 Debye)
is not particularly small, and its rotational frequencies
are not extraordinary, we expect that molecular ions in
Coulomb crystals do not generally become rotationally
cold. Also since the typical trapping potentials of Pen-
ning traps are typically similar to those of RF traps, no
gain with respect to rotational cooling in such traps is
expected.

When experimenting with polar molecular ions at
room temperature, it hence seems necessary to imple-
ment a kind of active rotational cooling in order to
achieve state speciﬁc molecular ion targets [19, 26]. Al-

4

ternatively, one might choose to cool the trap environ-
ment to cryogenic temperatures [27].

In conclusion, with 24MgH+ ions as the test case, we
have proven that the rotational motion of smaller polar
molecular ions sympathetically cooled into a Coulomb
crystal does not become signiﬁcantly cooled, but very
likely stays in nearly thermal equilibrium with the sur-
rounding environment.

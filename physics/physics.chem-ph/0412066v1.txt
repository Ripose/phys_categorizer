Abstract

The present study of small molecules containing silicon has been motivated by (a)
the considerable interest being shown currently in the kinetics and reactivity of such
molecules, and (b) the biotechnological potential of silicon-derivate surfaces as substrates
in the adsorption of, for instance, amino acids and proteins. Therefore, we have studied
by (i) a semi-empirical approach and (ii) an ab initio procedure employing low-order
Møller-Plesset perturbation theory, the molecular correlation energies of some neutral
closed and open shell silicon-containing molecules in the series SiXnYm. Procedure (i)
is shown to have particular merit for the correlation of the ionic members studied in the
above series, while the ab initio procedures employed come into their own for neutral
species.

1 Introduction

In the last twenty years, much work has been carried out in order to calculate the
correlation energy in atoms and molecules. In particular, in atoms, March and Wind
[1] showed how it is possible to recover the main trend of the semi-empirical correla-
tion energies obtained long ago by Clementi [2], using simple arguments based on the
correlation energy density (see also [3]).

Within the framework of Density Functional Theory (DFT), many studies have been
made to develop new correlation energy functionals. These are now available as a result
of the work of Vosko, Wilk and Nusair (VWN) [4], Lee, Yang and Parr (LYP) [5], and
Perdew and Wang (PW) [6], and have all been introduced into some quantum chemistry
packages (gaussian, nwchem, gamess, etc).

In a previous study (hereafter denoted as Paper I) [7], some of the present authors
have introduced a new semi-empirical technique in order to calculate the electron corre-
lation energy in molecules. Essential to this work was the division of the total electron
density of the molecule into parts belonging to speciﬁc nuclei, and a part belonging
solely to the chemical bond and therefore, by using semi-empirical modelling, strictly
correlated with the molecular bond-order (BO). One important conclusion of this work
was that the molecular correlation energy is generally larger, in absolute value, than the
sum of the correlation energies of the separated atoms. It is known from the pioneer-
ing work of Pauling, Mulliken, Coulson and other authors [8, 9, 10], that bond order
and molecular bond length are strongly correlated. In this sense our work is somewhat
[11, 12], where an analytical model of molecular
related to the work of Fulde et al.
correlation energies based on bond lengths was proposed.

In Paper I we developed a parameterization for compounds containing only hydrogen,
oxygen and carbon atoms and the related bonds X–Y (X, Y = C, H, O). The very good
results obtained in the calculation of the correlation energy for some molecules containing
these elements, compared with the experimental values, encouraged us to extend this
approach to second-row elements and in particular to silicon-containing compounds, like
ﬂuorine and chlorine-substituted silylenes, silyl radicals and silanes. It is relevant in this
context to note that Schlegel et al. [13, 14, 15] have calculated the heats of formation of
these compounds by ab initio methods, introducing part of the correlation energy using
the standard Møller-Plesset perturbative expansion technique.

We stress at this point that the kinetics and reactivity of small silicon-containing
molecules are attracting considerable interest, due to the quite diﬀerent reaction mech-
anism of the silicon compounds with respect to the carbon compounds. For example,
pyrolysis of silanes yields silylenes rather than silyl radicals, whereas photolysis produces
silyl radicals [16]. Moreover, silylenes and silyl radicals with various degrees of ﬂuorina-
tion (or chlorination) play an important role in chemical vapor deposition [17, 18, 19].
But the main area of interest of these compounds are the silicon-derivate surfaces which

2

are widely used as substrates in the adsorption process of biological compounds, such
as amino acids, proteins etc, in view of their application in diﬀerent biotechnology areas
such as biomaterials, biosensors, and bioseparation [20].

In this study we have investigated the correlation energies of SiXnYm (X, Y = H,
F, Cl; n + m = 4, 3, 2) compounds using both standard ab initio techniques, at various
levels of approximation, and the bond-order method developed in Paper I. In section 2
we describe brieﬂy the theoretical methods used to estimate the molecular correlation
energy. Møller-Plesset theoretical techniques are summarized in subsection 2.1 while
the Bond-Order Correlation Energy (BOCE) method is described in subsection 2.2.
Section 3 is concerned with the calculated correlation energies of SiXnYm compounds
and the ionization potentials (IP) of some of these molecules together with a comparison
with the experimental values. Our ﬁnal conclusions are recorded in Section 4.

2 Methods

2.1 Ab initio methods
Ab initio molecular orbital Hartree-Fock calculations (HF) were performed with the
gaussian 03 package [21] using the polarization 6-31G∗∗ basis sets. The 6-31G∗∗ basis
contains a set of six d Cartesian functions on each of the heavy atoms, and a set of three
p function on each hydrogen. Equilibrium geometries were obtained by full optimization
using analytical gradient methods [22]. Electron correlation energy was estimated with
Møller-Plesset (MP) perturbation theory [23] up to fourth order (MP4), including all
electrons and considering single, double excitations. Full molecular geometry optimiza-
tion was performed up to third order Møller-Plesset level (MP3). Quadruple excitations
(MP4SQDT) were introduced by ﬁxing the molecular geometry obtained from MP3
calculations. For both HF and MP calculations, restricted Hartree-Fock (RHF) and un-
restricted Hartree-Fock (UHF) methods were applied to closed and open shell systems,
respectively.

We stress, at the outset, that the emphasis of this work is the correlation energy. To
present such results on a large number of Si-containing compounds, we have deliberately
restricted the basis sets used. To extend these is straightforward for the future, should
it be deemed instructive to do so.

2.2 Bond-Order Correlation Energy (BOCE) Method
The ‘experimental’ correlation energy Eexp

is deﬁned as

c

Eexp

c = ES − EHF,

(1)

3

where EHF denotes the (molecular) Hartree-Fock energy and ES is the so-called Schr¨odin-
ger (or “true”) energy. In the case of atoms, the latter is obtained from the sum of the
experimental ionization energies, plus Bethe-Salpeter and relativistic corrections. In the
case of molecules, ES also includes smaller contributions, taking into account for the
other molecular degrees of freedom, such as vibrational and rotational motions. In both
cases, ES can be constructed from available data [24] following the standard procedure
described in Cremer’s papers [25, 26]. By using this procedure and the available ex-
perimental data, we have obtained ES for all molecules in the series SiXnYm (X, Y =
H, F, Cl; n + m = 4, 3, 2). Although Eexp
in Eq. (1) is usually referred to as an ‘ex-
perimental’ correlation energy, it obviously contains some theoretical input through the
Hartree-Fock energy EHF, whose degree of approximation can be controlled by choosing
a suﬃciently large basis set. Moreover, for some molecules, whenever the experimental
data for the heat of formation, or the vibrational molecular frequencies were unavailable,
we have made recourse to available theoretical estimates of these quantities, as indicated
in the table captions. Fig. 1 summarizes the deﬁnitions of the experimental correlation
energies, as well as of other various energies addressed in turn below.

c

Within the bond-order approach [7], the correlation energy can be estimated as

follows. Given the formation reaction of a generic molecule,

A + B −→ C + binding energy,

the molecular energy can be partitioned as

E(C) = E(A) + E(B) − binding energy = E(A) + E(B) + E(AB),

(3)

where E(AB) is the energy due to the A–B bond formation. Then, in general, the
Schr¨odinger energy ES of a polyatomic molecule can be written as

ES = X
A

ES(A) + X
all AB

ES(AB).

Likewise, in the HF approximation, the total molecular energy can be expressed in the
form

EHF = X
A

EHF(A) + X
all AB

EHF(AB).

Subtracting Eq. (5) from Eq. (4), one obtains the theoretical correlation energy as

where we take as known the Schr¨odinger atomic energy from experimental data, as

energy for the atom A in the molecule. This quantity is obtained from Eexp
(A) relative
to an isolated atom A and rescaled taking into account the eﬀective number of non-
bonding electrons of the atom A in the molecule. In particular, if n is the total number
of electrons of A involved in the bonds and Z its atomic number, Eexp
(Ain molecule) is
obtained as

The next step in the present approximation scheme is to consider Etheo

(AB) as
an analytical function of the bond-order PAB between the two atoms A and B of the
molecule. In practice, we have assumed a linear form for Etheo
(AB) as a function of
PAB, namely

c

c

Etheo

(AB) = aABPAB,

where aAB is a parameter which depends on the A–B bond. Moreover, the PAB bond-
order, according to L¨owdin’s deﬁnition [27], can be written as

PAB =

with D = S1/2T S1/2, S being the overlap matrix and T the ﬁrst-order density matrix
obtained from the HF calculation. One then obtains:

The parameters aAB can be obtained from a model system which contains the A–B
bond and for which is it possible to calculate the Schr¨odinger molecular energy ES and
then the experimental correlation energy Eexp
. After obtaining the best values of the
c
aAB parameters for each A–B bond, application of Eq. (8) then permits to calculate
the theoretical correlation energy Etheo
. In Appendix A we report a speciﬁc example to
illustrate the procedure used to obtain the aAB parameters.

3 Results and discussion

3.1 Neutral closed and open shell SiXnYm compounds

In order to calculate the correlation energy of ﬂuorine and chlorine-substituted silylenes
compounds, we have obtained the bond parameter aAB of Eq. (8) using the experi-
mental correlation energy Eexp
of some model molecules and the experimental atomic
correlation energies. In Tab. 1 we report the Schr¨odinger and the HF atomic energies
of the constituent atoms in their fundamental state and the related correlation energies.

c

5

In Tab. 2 we record results for some model systems together with the bond parameter
extracted from Eexp

. All energy values are in Hartrees.

c

In the second column of Tab. 3 we record the Schr¨odinger energy of the SiXnYm
compounds under study, obtained from experimental values of the heat of formation
and of the vibrational frequencies of these molecules [13, 14, 15]. For the compounds for
which no such experimental data were available, the theoretical values of these quantities
were used to calculate the Schr¨odinger energy. Columns 3–6 of Tab. 3 report the total

energy obtained at the HF, MP2, MP3 and MP4SDTQ4 (MP4) levels.
column, the BOCE energy is reported. For the sake of simplicity, Tab. 3 does not
include the molecules employed in the BOCE treatment to calculate the bond-order
parameter aAB. Tab. 4 reports the experimental and the calculated correlation energies
for the same molecules listed in Tab. 3.

From Tab. 3, it is evident that using the ab initio methods, the successive corrections
to the molecular energy are very small. The diﬀerences between the MP2 and MP3
results range in general between 0.02 − 0.04 a.u., while the diﬀerence between the next
successive corrections, MP3 and MP4, is even smaller (0.01 − 0.02 a.u.). For some
molecules (SiHF3, SiHF2, SiF2), the total energy increases on passing from the MP2 to
the MP3 correction. This trend is better evidenced by the correlation energies in Tab. 4.
There, the change in the values of Ec ranges between 0.02 and 0.05 a.u., on going from
the MP2 to the MP4 correction.

The very good agreement of the calculated molecular energy using the BOCE tech-
nique with the Schr¨odinger value appears clearly from the values in Tabs. 3 and 4. The
highly accurate values of the correlation energy obtained from BOCE for all molecules
of the series are conﬁrmed from the calculated percentage error with respect to the ex-
perimental correlation energy, ranging within 0.002 − 4.06 %. On the contrary, ab initio
correlation energies yield very high percentage errors. In Tab. 3, for some molecules, the
calculated correlation energy with the BOCE method gives a value higher than the ex-
perimental one, and the corresponding molecular energy is lower than the Schr¨odinger
energy. The absolute percentage error for these molecules has a value in the range
between 0.002 % and 0.4 %. However, it is important to add some comments here.
The ﬁrst one is that the Schr¨odinger energy is obtained from experimental data and
any experimental measurement is subject to an error that, in general, is about ±5 %.
The second comment, pertaining to the compounds corresponding to a molecular energy
lower than the Schr¨odinger energy, is that one needs to note that in closed shell systems,
such as those considered here, this happens only in two cases, where we have used some
theoretical values (vibrational frequencies, or molecular heat of formation, or both) in
order to determine the Schr¨odinger molecular energy.

The results of Tab. 4 are shown in Fig. 2. From this ﬁgure it can be seen that
the trends of the calculated correlation energies using ab initio methods are close to
the experimental behaviour, but the values are on average 1.5 a.u. higher than the

6

experimental values. Moreover, the increase in the calculated correlation energy on
passing from MP2 to MP4 is negligible and, taking into account that the computational
eﬀort increases considerably from MP2 to MP4, we can conclude that it is not necessary
to make corrections at higher order than MP2. This is conﬁrmed by Fig. 3, where the
absolute percentage error between the experimental and theoretical correlation energies
is almost constant for each compound on passing from MP2 to MP4.

The extent of the agreement between the experimental and the calculated BOCE
correlation energies is shown in Fig. 2 (last panel), where the experimental and the
BOCE curves are almost superimposed and hardly distinguishable. Consequently, as
shown in Fig. 3, the percentage error between the experimental and the calculated
BOCE correlation energies is nearly constant, and varies between 0.002 % and 4.0 %.

3.2

Ionization potentials (IP)

We have also calculated the ionization potentials (IP) of some SiXnYm compounds,
using both ab initio and BOCE methods. These results have then been compared with
the experimental values. Within the so-called ∆SCF procedure, the theoretical values
of IP (in eV) are deﬁned as the diﬀerence between the total energies of the neutral and
the ionized molecule, i.e.

IP = E − E+

(11)

(see also Fig. 1). Table 5 reports the experimental and calculated IP for the molecules
In these calculations, the geometries of both the neutral and the ionic
under study.
species have been optimized.

In the second column of Tab. 5 we record the IP values obtained as the diﬀerence E −
E+, both calculated at HF level (without correlation), while in columns 5, 7, and 9 this
diﬀerence refers to the calculated values at the MP2, MP3, and MP4 levels, respectively.
Finally, column 11 reports the calculated IP values using the BOCE method. Fig. 4
displays the data in Tab. 5.

From Tab. 5 it is clear that the MP corrections, contrary to the case of the neutral
compounds, are important in the IP calculation. In fact, in all compounds of this series
(with the exception of SiH4), the absolute percentage error of the IP at the HF level is
very high (∼ 7 %; see Fig. 5), and the introduction of correlation eﬀects at MP2 level
reduces this error to 3.26 %, on the average. Then the introduction of correlation in the
estimate of IP yields a calculated value closer to the experimental one. The trend of
the next corrections, both at the MP3 and at the MP4 levels, is not constant. For some
compounds of this series, SiH4, SiH2F2, SiHCl3, and SiF4, the percentage error decreases
on passing from MP2 to MP4. On the contrary, for other compounds (SiCl4, SiH3Cl)
the error increases, while for SiHF3 and SiH2Cl2 the best estimate of IP is obtained at
the MP3 level. The average absolute percentage errors for the MP2, MP3, and MP4
corrections are 3.26 %, 3.26 %, and 3.44 %, respectively, thus showing that all these

7

low order MP corrections give almost equivalent approximations of the IP. Coming now
to the BOCE approach, from the absolute percentage errors plotted in Fig. 5 one may
conclude that this method yields more accurate estimates of the IP, on the average, than
the ab initio methods, although the MP methods occasionally produce lower absolute
percentage errors in IP than the BOCE method.

A ﬁnal consideration concerns the calculated diﬀerences, ∆, between the experimen-
tal and calculated IP, reported in Tab. 5. Fig. 1 schematically deﬁnes the experimental
and theoretical correlation energies for both neutral and ionic molecules. According to
Fig. 1, we may then deduce that
IPexp − IPtheo = (Eexp

c − Etheo
In Tab. 5
where a superscript + refers to the same quantity in the ionic molecule.
we record the experimental and theoretical ionization potentials (IP), along with their
diﬀerence, ∆. The fact that the average error in the calculation of the IP is not very
diﬀerent within the MP and BOCE methods, is an indication that there are large can-
cellations between the correlation energies of the neutral and the ionic molecules. In
turn, this means that within the BOCE approach also the correlation energy of the ions
is well approximated by using the same bond parameters aAB, as derived for the same
model molecules.

4 Summary and concluding remarks

The biotechnological possibilities of silicon-containing molecules in substrate layers, plus
much current interest in understanding the quite diﬀerent reaction mechanism of silicon
compounds in comparison with carbon compounds, has motivated us to extend our
earlier work [7] on the latter class to the case of Si.

What seemed to us important in this diﬀerent series of small molecules was to assess
the utility of our earlier semi-empirical use of molecular bond-order to estimate elec-
tron correlation energies in some members of C-containing molecules when applied to
SiXnYm, where X, Y = H, F, Cl, and n + m = 4, 3, 2. In this process, we have found it
valuable to compare and contrast our bond-order approach with some ab initio results
we have obtained using low-order Møller-Plesset perturbation theory. While, by these
two approaches, we record quite a number of useful results for molecular correlation
energies of Si-containing molecules, we wish especially to stress that the semi-empirical
bond-order approach proposed in [7] and applied there to C-containing molecules con-
tinues to be valuable for molecules of the class SiXnYm. It seems particularly useful
when ionicity plays a role, whereas the low-order Møller-Plesset approach comes into its
own for essentially neutral members of this series.

In conclusion, we emphasize the essence of the present approach which is to yield an
impressive empirical correlation for obtaining bond additivity corrections to the energy

8

based on bond orders calculated from a L¨owdin population analysis. In order to present
rather extensive results for a series of Si-containing molecules, we have, in the present
work, accepted the limitations of the small basis set used. However, should it prove
instructive for future purposes, it is a straightforward matter to extend the basis, even
if somewhat time-consuming. Plainly, then, some quantitative changes will occur and
also some speciﬁc technical points can be examined such as the numerical modiﬁcations
in the L¨owdin population analyses, and the parameters obtained from them, due to
changes in the basis set. Another matter deserving attention if eventually larger basis
sets are used concerns speciﬁcally the Si-F bond, which present indications suggest is
somewhat problematic in the calculations, or experiment, or perhaps both.

We are encouraged by the results of the present investigation to attempt a pilot
study of the relevance of our bond-order considerations to the still more diﬃcult area of
the kinetics and reactivity of small Si-containing molecules. We hope to report on this
area, approached via our semi-empirical procedures, at a later date.

A Calculation of the bond-order parameter aSiH

In this Appendix we describe the procedure employed to estimate the bond parameter
aAB in Eq. (8), when AB = SiH. According to Eqs. (3) and (8), the experimental
correlation energy of the SiH4 molecule can be written as

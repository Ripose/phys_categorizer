Abstract

We present a simple numerical procedure for calculating the irrotational hydrodynamic ﬂow in

a helium solvation structure around a spherical solute in linear motion through superﬂuid helium.

The calculation requires only the radial helium density around the impurity as input. From the

resulting irrotational ﬂow, the helium contribution to the eﬀective mass of the solute is calculated.

The results for alkali cations are compared to recent many-body Variational Monte Carlo (VMC)

calculations by M. Buzzacchi, D. E. Galli, and L. Reatto (Phys. Rev. B., 64 094512 (2001)). The

helium contribution to the eﬀective masses calculated by the two methods are 12.9(4.6) versus 9.4

u for Li+, 48.2(5.6) versus 52.1 u for Na+, 69.6(4.8) versus 70.1 u for K+, and 6.4(8.8) versus 6.8 for

Cs+, with the VMC result listed ﬁrst (with one σ statistical error estimate) and the hydrodynamic

result listed second. For the cases of Na+ and K+, the hydrodynamic calculation treated the

ﬁrst helium solvation shell as a rigid solid, as suggested by the VMC calculations; treating the

ﬁrst solvent layer as part of the superﬂuid lead to considerable underestimate, ≈ 50%, of the mass

increase in both cases. In all cases, the agreement of the two results are in within the error estimate

of the VMC calculation, demonstrating the accuracy of hydrodynamic treatment of helium motion

even on the atomic length scale.

The study of atomic ions as microscopic probes of superﬂuidity in helium-4 has a rich

history [1]. Recent progress on both the injection of neutral metal atoms into bulk liquid

helium [2, 3] and the study of doped helium nanodroplets [4] have caused a renewed in-

terest in the dynamical behavior of solutes in this unique quantum liquid. In particular,

concerning the rotational degrees of freedom, here have recently been several papers that

try to provide a microscopic explaination for the observed sizable fractional increase in the

rotational moments of inertia of all but the fastest rotors when dissolved in superﬂuid he-

lium [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. In all of the proposed models, the extra moment of inertia arises

from helium kinetic energy induced by rotation of the molecule, but there is disagreement

about the way this should be calculated, and about the physical description of the helium

motion [11].

A closely related problem is that of the change in the eﬀective translational mass of

a solute in superﬂuid helium, which also arise from helium kinetic energy induced by the

requirement that the helium solvation structure must ‘follow’ a moving impurity.

In the

quantum hydrodynamic model [8, 12], one calculates the classical velocity potential that

describes the irrotational ﬂow which maintains a constant helium solvation structure in the

frame of a moving impurity. By a theorem of Lord Kelvin [8, 13], this irrotational ﬂow will

provide the minimum kinetic energy ﬂow that satisﬁes the equation of continuity. A simple

example is the case of a moving spherical “hole” in the liquid, for which the hydrodynamic

ﬂow is a dipole ﬁeld that carries a kinetic energy equal to one half of that of the liquid mass

displaced by the sphere moving at the velocity of the hole [13]. For the general case of an

inhomogeneous density, Barrera and Baym [14] have presented a solution to the equation

of continuity, based upon a transformation of dipole solution. However, this transformed

solution is not irrotational, and if fact has a continuously varying vorticity, and thus is not

appropriate for ﬂow in a superﬂuid, where vorticity must be quantized.

This paper presents a general numerical scheme for ﬁnding the irrotational solution of

the equation of continuity given a solvation density around a moving spherical solute. The

hydrodynamic equation can be solved by separation of variables, and reduces to one di-

mensional quadrature of the radial homogeneous and inhomogeneous equations, allowing

the mixed boundary conditions to be satisﬁed without need for iteration. In the limit of

inﬁnitesimal solute velocity, the given solution can be shown [12] to provide a variationally

optimized helium ground state wave function, assuming a one-body phase function. As such,

2

it should provide a rigorous lower bound on the true increase in eﬀective mass.

In order to test the quantitative accuracy of this approximation, we have compared the
calculated mass increase for Li+, Na+, K+, and Cs+ with those calculated by Buzzacchi,

Galli, and Reatto [15] using a Variational Monte Carlo (VMC) treatment of the explicit

many-body problem [16, 17]. The input to the hydrodynamic calculations were the helium

radial densities calculated by these same authors using the same method; thus the compar-

ison provides a direct test of the accuracy of the one-particle hydrodynamic treatment on

atomic length scales.

I. CALCULATION METHOD

Consider an atomic solute in superﬂuid He that has a solvation structure with radial

number density ρ(r). We assume that the solute is moving with velocity V (in a direction

we take as the z axis), and that the solvation structure adiabatically moves with the atom.
This generates an irrotational ﬂow in the helium of velocity v = −∇φ, where φ is the

velocity potential, which must satisfy the equation of continuity:

∇(ρ∇φ) =

= −(∇ρ) · (V ˆz)

dρ
dt

(1)

(2)

If we write φ = ˜φ(r) V cos(θ) where r is the distance from the impurity atom and θ is the
angle with the ˆz axis, we ﬁnd that the hydrodynamic equation of continuity is solved if ˜φ

satisﬁes the following radial equation:

At long range from the atom, the density must approach the bulk value, ρe, and ˜φ → A/r2.

On the inner wall of the solvation structure, ri (where the helium density vanishes rapidly),
d ˜φ
dr → −1. The general solution to the inhomogeneous equation 2 can be written as a sum of
any inhomogeneous solution plus any linear combination of the homogeneous solutions. The

homogeneous equation is found by setting the right hand side of Eq. 2 equal to zero. The

inhomogeneous solution that satisﬁes the boundary conditions was found as follows. At large

ro, inhomogeneous and homogeneous solutions were started assuming the asymptotic form.
The value of A = r3

i /2, which is the correct value for the uniform density case, was used

to start the solutions. The two solutions are numerically integrated until r = ri, at which

3

point the derivatives of the homogeneous solution, ˜φh and the inhomogeneous solution, ˜φinh

are used to determine the constant B, equal to:

The inhomogeneous solution satisfying the boundary conditions is:

(cid:17)

(cid:16)

˜φ(r) = ˜φinh(r) + B ˜φh(r)

The hydrodynamic kinetic energy is found by integrating the helium kinetic energy, which

is proportional to V 2. This allows us to deﬁne a hydrodynamic mass, Mh, by

This integral is evaluated from the numerical solution over the domain ri ≤ r ≤ ro. If we

assume that the solution for r > ro is given by the asymptotic form, then this gives an
additional contribution of (8π/3) MHe ρe ˜φ(ro)2 ro to the integral deﬁning Mh. It has been

checked that this deﬁnition of Mh gives the correct value of one half the displaced helium

mass for the case of a hole in helium of uniform density.

It is also possible to use the hydrodynamic equation to transform the integral for the

eﬀective mass to give:

II. APPLICATION TO ALKALI CATIONS

Figure 1 shows the helium solvation densities around Li+, Na+, K+, and Cs+, as cal-

culated by VMC [15] using a trial function of the “shadow function” form. This tech-

nique treats solids, liquids, and solid-liquid mixtures with a single functional form citePed-

eriva94,Duminuco00. It can be noted that the solvation density goes almost to zero between
the ﬁrst and second solvent layers for K+, and is highly structured in the case of Na+. The
VMC calculations ﬁnd that the ﬁrst solvation layer has a highly solid-like order for the Na+
and K+ cases with little to no exchange of these atoms between solvent layers [15, 17]. This

suggests that the ﬁrst solvation layer not be treated as part of the ﬂuid but as a ﬁxed mass

that moves rigidly with the cation, as in the snowball model of Atkins [18]. In contrast, the
VMC ﬁnd substantial mobility between solvation layers for Li+ and Cs+, suggesting that in

these cases that even the highly compacted ﬁrst solvation layer should be treated as part of

the superﬂuid, and thus be treated as part of the hydrodynamic ﬂow.

Table I contains comparisons of the eﬀective mass for each cation calculated using a

hydrodynamic treatment and estimated from the VMC calculations. It is seen that in all

four cases, the agreement of the two estimates is excellent, being within the VMC statistical
error estimate. For the cases of Na+ and K+, the ﬁrst solvation shell, with 10 and 12

helium atoms respectively, was treated as a rigid solid and the hydrodynamic calculations

were begun at the minimum density point between the ﬁrst and second solvent shells. In

both these cases, treating the entire density with the hydrodynamic approach yielded a
substantial underestimate for the translational mass; 21.7 u for Na+ and 36.0 u for K+. The

hydrodynamic calculations are vastly less computationally expensive than the many-body

treatment [19].

It is useful to compare our present results with that of the widely used model of the

cation “snowball” due to Atkins [18]. In this electrostrictive model, the helium is treated

as a continuum dielectric material, whose density is increased near the cation due to the
ion-induced dipole interaction. For a radius less than b, on the order of 5-6 ˚A (whose value

depends upon the helium liquid-solid surface tension assumed but is independent of the

speciﬁc singly charged cation [1]), the helium is predicted to form a solid “snowball” that

moves rigidly with the ion. This snowball contributes a mass of ≈ 150 u to the ion eﬀective

mass [1]. In addition, there is a hydrodynamic contribution to the mass, expected to be

5

on the order of the hard sphere value mHS = 2π

3 b3ρemHe ≈ 40 u. Taking into account the
increased helium density for r slightly larger than b, using the model used by Barrera and
Baym [14] (ρ − ρe = ρeλ(b/r)4 with λ = 0.186), the above hydrodynamic treatment predicts

the hydrodynamic contribution to the mass to be 0.932mHS, which can be compared to

the value 0.97mHS reported by Barrera and Baym [14] for their proposed velocity solution

which is not irrotational. In agreement with the Kelvin minimum energy principle [13], their

solution is higher in kinetic energy and thus predicts a higher mass. Comparision with the

both the VMC and hydrodynamic results show that the eﬀective masses, even for the case

of rigid ﬁrst solvation shells, is considerably less than those predicted by the snowball model

of Atkins.

III. CONCLUSIONS

The present work demonstrates that the hydrodynamic treatment of the linear motion of

a solute through superﬂuid helium predicts the solvent contributions to the eﬀective mass of

the impurity in quantitative agreement with more exact many-body approaches, yet requires

only a trivial additional computational cost once the solvent density has been calculated.
This applies to helium density well inside the predicted 5-6 ˚A radius of the liquid-solid

surface in the “snowball” model of Atkins [18]. However, the highly ordered ﬁrst solvent

layer around some ions must be treated as a solid that rigidly moves with the ion. The

present results compliment our recent hydrodynamic calculations of solvent contributions

to the moments of inertia of molecules solvated in helium, which were found to be in good

agreement with experiment [8]. The present results have been directly compared to higher

levels of theory and thus provide a more critical test of the hydrodynamic model, since

uncertainties in the solute-helium potentials do not enter. We therefore demonstrate that

the hydrodynamic treatment of superﬂuid helium motion can be accurate on the atomic

scale, directly refuting recent criticisms of its use [9].

[19] M. Buzzacchi (private communication) reported that each VMC run to calculate the mass

required approximately four days on a 16 PC Beowulf cluster. In contrast, given the helium

solvation density (which is much less expensive to calculate by Monte Carlo methods than the

excitation energies), the hydrodynamic calculation took on the order of one second.

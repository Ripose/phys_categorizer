Received April 11, The Journal of Theoretical and Computational Chemistry (http://www.worldscinet.com/jtcc/jtcc.shtml).

We review and further develop the recently intro-
duced numerical approach [Phys. Rev. Lett. 86, 5031,
(2001)] for scattering calculations based on a so called
pseudo-time Schr¨odinger equation, which is in turn a modi-
ﬁcation of the damped Chebyshev polynomial expansion
scheme [J. Chem. Phys. 103, 2903, (1995)]. The method
utilizes a special energy-dependent form for the absorb-
ing potential in the time-independent Schr¨odinger equa-
tion, in which the complex energy spectrum is mapped
inside the unit disk Ek → uk, where uk are the eigen-
values of some explicitly known sparse matrix U . Most
importantly for the numerical implementation, all the
physical eigenvalues uk are the extreme eigenvalues of
U (i.e., uk ≈ 1 for resonances and uk = 1 for the bound
states), which allows one to extract these eigenvalues
very eﬃciently by harmonic inversion of a pseudo-time au-
tocorrelation function y(t) = φTU tφ using the ﬁlter diago-
nalization method. The computation of y(t) up to time t =
2T requires only T sparse real matrix-vector multiplica-
tions. We describe and compare diﬀerent schemes, eﬀec-
tively corresponding to diﬀerent choices of the energy-
dependent absorbing potential, and test them numer-
ically by calculating resonances of the HCO molecule.
Our numerical tests suggest an optimal scheme that pro-
vide accurate estimates for most resonance states using
a single autocorrelation function.

Key Words: quantum scattering, absorbing potential,
resonances, pseudo-time Schr¨odinger equation, Cheby-
shev polynomial expansion,
iterative diagonalization,
harmonic inversion, ﬁlter diagonalization method.

Introduction.
In this paper we present a detailed de-
scription and further generalization of the methodology de-

1

veloped in the preceding works [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] for the eﬃcient
numerical solution of the quantum scattering problem as-
sociated with the time-independent Schr¨odinger equation

(Hψ)(r) = Eψ(r).

(1)

Eq. 1 may possess bound states with real energies E
and wavefunctions ψ(r) exponentially localized in space,
and resonance states (Siegert states [6]) having complex
energies with Im E
0. The latter behave like bound
states in some compact subset Ω of the conﬁguration space,
but eventually grow exponentially outside of Ω, due to the
outgoing asymptotic boundary conditions.

≤

The corresponding bound state problem is conceptually
simple and very well understood. The numerical solu-
tion of (1) at dissociation energies is much more diﬃcult
as it requires the solution of a boundary value problem.
One can avoid the latter by the use of a so-called optical
(or absorbing) potential W (r) with Im W (r)
0 (in the
W ∗) is positive semideﬁnite, where ∗ de-
sense that i(W
Ω and
notes conjugate transposition), that vanishes for r
smoothly grows outside Ω. Numerically, this has negligible
eﬀect on the scattering solutions ψ(r) of

−

≤

∈

(Hψ)(r) = (E

W (r))ψ(r)

−

inside Ω, i.e., the physically relevant region, and damps
them outside Ω [7]. In other words, the complex absorb-
ing potential forces the resonance solutions to behave like
bound states everywhere without signiﬁcantly aﬀecting the
energies E. In this framework the physically relevant part
of the system is, therefore, dissipative and satisﬁes (1) only
for r
Ω. Moreover, a general multichannel scattering
problem can be considered with a numerically convenient
form of W (r), independent of the choice of coordinate sys-
tem. The price for these beneﬁts is that the originally
hermitian problem becomes non-hermitian; but it is gen-
erally still complex symmetric.

Unfortunately, for very large systems with high den-
sity of states one may encounter numerical diﬃculties
when trying to diagonalize a large nonhermitian matrix
H ′ = H + W or solve the linear system (E
H ′)φ(E) = ψ
at many values of E using general iterative techniques for
nonhermitian matrices. For instance, the Krylov subspace
algorithms, such as the Lanczos diagonalization procedure,
usually converge well for the extreme eigenvalues of H ′,
while numerical problems may occur for interior complex
eigenvalues of H ′ in the dense spectral regions, requir-
ing more sophisticated schemes. As such a new technique
called PIST was recently introduced by Poirier and Car-
rington [13]. The PIST method is based on a very eﬃcient
preconditioning within a QMR-Lanczos framework for it-
erative diagonalization of large and sparse DVR Hamilto-
nians with complex absorbing potentials. It is also appro-
priate to mention the time-dependent approach based on
solution of the time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation,

φ(t) = e−itH

which is widely used because of its simplicity, and can
also be viewed as a Krylov subspace method with Krylov

generated by the powers of the evolution operator U =

with the weights dk = ψTψkψT

Furthermore, the recently developed Filter Diagonaliza-
tion Method (FDM) [14, 2] (see also refs.
[15, 16] on
other related superresolution methods of spectral analy-
sis) to solve the harmonic inversion problem (7) with the
unknowns
generally leads to an enormous resolu-
tion enhancement, thus signiﬁcantly reducing the required
propagation time, as well as the overall numerical work.
At ﬁrst glance the time-dependent framework seems nearly
optimal as the time correlation functions can be generated
at low cost by various iterative techniques, e.g., the split-
operator method [17]. The diﬃculty, however, arises when
both the density and the number of states are very high,
in which case the time domain data C(t) must be very ac-
curate at very long times in order to provide the adequate
conditions for, e.g., FDM. Unfortunately, this requirement
is very hard to satisfy, as it is diﬃcult to accurately eval-
uate the matrix exponential e−itH
for a non-hermitian
operator H ′ at very large values of t.

Apparently, for a quantum system with Hamiltonian op-
erator that is not explicitly time-dependent, there is noth-
ing special about the time-dependent Schr¨odinger equa-
tion, except that it provides a convenient framework for
both thinking and devising various numerical techniques
to solve the time-independent problem, for example, those
based on processing the time correlation functions. As
such we can consider alternative dynamical schemes hav-
ing the convenient structure of Eqs. 5-7, albeit with a
pseudo-evolution operator U , somehow related to the un-
derlying Hamiltonian H, but whose action on a vector can
be evaluated easily. To this end the analogy between the

−

−
with initial conditions φ(0) = φ, φ(1) = 0, can be writ-
ten in the familiar form (5) with some eﬀective evolution
operator U . The corresponding pseudo-time Schr¨odinger
equation allows one to reap all the beneﬁts of the time-
dependent methods without having to deal with the stan-
dard time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation (4) involving
nonhermitian Hamiltonian;
it only requires the evalua-
tion of a single H-matrix-vector product per time step
and avoids the use of complex arithmetic, even when the
absorbing potential is implemented.

As is well known, a (physical time) autocorrelation func-
tion at time 2t can be computed by solving the time-
dependent Schr¨odinger equation up to time t, since one
can use

C(t) := φTU 2tφ = (U tφ)T(U tφ),

assuming only the complex symmetry of the evolution op-
erator U , which is always easy to achieve, both with ab-
sorbing potential or without. For the Chebyshev autocor-
relation function

y(t) := φTφ(t),

(11)

where the vectors φ(t) are generated by Eq. 8, a factor of
two saving is also well known (see, e.g., the discussion in
ref. [2]):

y(2t + p) = 2φ(t)Tφ(t + p)

y(p)

−

with p = 0, 1. When the damped scheme (9) is imple-
mented, this recipe does not provide the correct autocor-
relation function as deﬁned by Eq. 11. Nevertheless, it was
tried by Li and Guo [4]. The resulting doubled sequence,
when processed by FDM, gave approximately correct reso-
nance energies and widths. In ref. [5] starting with the re-
cursion formula (10) we derived an exact doubling scheme
for the corresponding autocorrelation function (11):

y(2t + p) = φ(t)Tφ(t + p)

φ(t + 1)TD−1φ(t + 1 + p)

−

with p = 0, 1.

We note that the damping operator D in Eq. 9, as well
as in Eq. 10, eﬀectively leads to an energy-dependent com-
plex absorbing potential WE(r), which may have a small
or large real part relative to its imaginary part, depend-
ing on the particular recursion formula and the energy
E. Usually, having too large Re WE(r) is not desirable.
Unfortunately, within the two frameworks one has little
control over this circumstance. In the present paper, we
re-derive and extend the above results by using a more ﬂex-
ible form for the absorbing potential, which can be adapted
easily. The resulting pseudo-time Schr¨odinger equation is
shown to be very convenient for calculating various dy-
namical properties, such as resonance parameters or ma-
trix elements of the Green’s function. The latter is carried

out by generating the pseudo-time cross-correlation func-
tions followed by their inversion. A numerical example
demonstrates the validity of the theory and compares dif-
ferent damping schemes, suggesting an optimal scheme,
that leads to accurate results with minimal computational
eﬀort.

its spectrum between ¯H

without loss of generality that the Hamiltonian matrix is
already shifted and scaled so that

Such a scaling is implemented routinely in the frame-
work of the Chebyshev polynomial expansion. We note
that this typically moves the ground state energy to the
lower edge of the spectrum, E =
1, while the energies
of interest, including the dissociation energies, appear at
the bottom of the spectrum, E
1, as the total spec-
tral range is usually an order of magnitude larger than the
physically relevant spectral range.

of ˆU did not possess the very important property that the
spectral domain of ˆU is the unit disk.

The eigenpairs (uk, ψk) of (17) can be used to evaluate
the physically interesting quantities (e.g., the complex res-
onance energies Ek, scattering amplitudes, etc.). However,
because of the nonlinearity they have somewhat diﬀerent
properties from those of the regular nonhermitian eigen-
value problem, which we now proceed to derive.

where (uk, ψk) is an eigenpair of (17). Since conversely,
any such eigenpair determines an eigenpair of ˆU, the
nonlinear eigenvalue problem (17) has at most 2K dis-
tinct eigenvalues.
If there are 2K distinct eigenvalues
u1, . . . , u2K, the matrix ˆU is diagonalizable, and there is a
basis ˆψ1, . . . , ˆψ2K of eigenvectors of the form (25). There-

RESONANCE CALCULATION BY
HARMONIC INVERSION OF PSEUDO-TIME
CORRELATION FUNCTIONS

The spectral mapping Ek

uk (15) moves all the phys-
→
ically relevant eigenvalues to the vicinity of the unit circle,
i.e., they all become extreme (or nearly extreme for the
resonances) eigenvalues of ˆU . This, in turn, creates very
favorable conditions for computing these eigenvalues iter-
atively using any suitable Krylov subspace method with
the Krylov vectors generated by the powers of ˆU, because
the extreme eigenstates contribute most to the latter. In
the present framework, such a strategy of computing the
bound and resonance state energies, in its most simple and
convenient form, boils down to the harmonic inversion of
pseudo-time correlation functions (40), which due to (43)
satisfy

Thus the nonlinear eigenvalue problem (17) is reduced
to the signal processing problem of ﬁnding the spectral
parameters (uk, dαβk) (k = 1, . . . , 2K) satisfying (46)
for the sequence(s) yαβ(t) computed by (42) and (40).
The simplest procedure then corresponds to considering
a single doubled autocorrelation function yαα(t) with t =
0, . . . , 2T . In exact arithmetic the harmonic inversion of
such a sequence will give the exact results if T > 2K,
thus, using only T
2K of real matrix-vector products.
However, this is impractical as it would formally require
to solve a T
T eigenvalue problem. To reduce the com-
putational burden and to maintain numerical stability the
eigenvalues are extracted very eﬃciently in a small Fourier
subspace by the FDM [14, 2]. If we introduce the unscaled
energy ε = E∆H + ¯H, the required length 2T of the dou-
bled sequence needed to converge an eigenenergy Ek (cf.
Eq. 15) by the FDM will be deﬁned by the locally aver-
aged density of states ρ(ε) for Ek
E and the spectral
range ∆H of the Hamiltonian matrix according to the ap-
proximate relationship [2, 31]

This results in an enormous numerical saving as, tradi-
tionally, the time-dependent approaches require multiple
initial state propagations in order to compute, for example,
the full S-matrix or cumulative reaction probability. How-
ever, the described approach, although formally exact (in
exact arithmetic), is applicable only when the dynamics is
governed solely by narrow resonances: the parameters of
very broad resonances (or poles of the Green’s function)
are generally grossly inaccurate, leading to very unstable
spectral estimation by Eq. 50. A signiﬁcant numerical
saving in cases with broad resonances is, however, achiev-
able if one adapts another strategy in which one (i) prop-

has a potential of reducing the total propagation time T
required for the accurate harmonic inversion by a factor
of L, i.e., preserving the total number of matrix-vector
multiplications, Ntotal = L
T . Unfortunately, to use the
×
doubling trick (45) in this case, the storage requirement to
generate the cross-correlation matrix is increased because
of the need to simultaneously propagate L states rather
than one.

PRACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS: CHOOSING
THE ABSORBING POTENTIAL

The physical observables can generally be computed
from the Green’s function matrix elements at real ener-
gies. For this reason and for the sake of simplicity in the
following analysis we will assume the energy E to be real.
However, essentially the same conclusions hold for com-
plex energies near the real axis, i.e., including the narrow
resonances.

In particular, a positive Re WE reduces the total density

of states ρ(E), while aﬀecting only slightly the resonance
states, and thus, it may accelerate the convergence (cf. Eq.
47). At the same time Re WE may get excessively large
compared to Im WE, for example, near the spectral edge,
E
1, if D0 = 0. It is not absolutely clear without nu-
merical tests how this artifact will aﬀect the results, while
it can be controlled if the matrix D0, which is in principle
unrestricted, is used. Namely, relatively to the total spec-
tral range ∆H (which becomes unity after scaling of H),
the physical energy range is generally only a small part of
the unit disk. Therefore, within this range we can often

In order to avoid negative
Re WE in the physically relevant energy region, it suﬃces
to take E0 higher than the maximum energy of interest.

Clearly, the behavior of the absorbing potential WE
where it starts to turn on has the main eﬀect for the scat-
tering calculations. In fact, as follows from our numerical
tests, the best performance is achieved when both D1

the state vectors. Therefore, it is convenient to use the
real operators γ1 and γ2 deﬁned by

≈

≈

D1 = eγ1, D2 = e−γ2,

(54)

which vanish in Ω and slowly turn on in the absorbing
region, and assume that both γ1 and γ2 are small. By
expanding into the Taylor series up to the second order,
we can rewrite (51) as

Note again that in the computations involving molecu-
lar vibrational spectra the energies of interest are usually
close to the bottom of the spectral range of the scaled
Hamiltonian matrix, E
1. Deﬁning the shifted energy
ε := E + 1 with zero at the bottom of the spectrum and

being a function of the reaction coordinate R, vanishing
in the interaction region, R < RΩ, and smoothly growing

sensitive to ∆H, but generally small.

Thus the diﬀerence between M&T and N&M schemes is
the diﬀerent behavior of Re WE. This diﬀerence may be
eliminated almost completely by manipulating with D0. In
the next section, we examine the eﬀect of this diﬀerence
on the quality of the resonance calculations.

We expect the results to be generally insensitive to a
particular form of WE as long as γ1 and γ2 are suﬃciently
smooth and have suﬃciently large spatial extension. So

In order to obtain the best resonance energy estimates
for given basis set, the common practice is to search for
stationary eigenvalues Ek under variations of the absorb-
ing potential [7, 10, 23]. This is usually done by varying
its amplitude, which here corresponds to the free parame-
ter λ. (One could possibly change instead E0, or treat E0
as a function of λ.) The eigenvalue trajectories Ek(λ) are
then analyzed for stationary points, such as the point of
maximum curvature, which in an ideal case may be a cusp
(see Fig. 2). One way to practically ﬁnd such a point is
to minimize the derivative dEk/dλ. The generation of the
eigenvalue trajectories usually signiﬁcantly increases the

PSEUDO-TIME SCHR ¨ODINGER EQUATION

computational time, while a reasonable accuracy for most
states can be achieved from a single or a few runs using
an a priori established optimal value of λ. Therefore, such
a search is justiﬁed only if a very high accuracy for all
resonances is needed. The cases where eigenvalue trajec-
tory analysis may be necessary include extremely narrow
(shape) resonances.

NUMERICAL EXAMPLE: RESONANCES OF
THE HCO MOLECULE.

In this section we apply the present approach for an ac-
curate computation of the nonrotating HCO resonances.
This system has been used in the past by various groups
as a benchmark problem to test new approaches (see the
comprehensive review [13] and references therein). In par-
ticular, the ﬁrst resonance calculation using FDM was ap-
plied to HCO [24]. We use the potential energy surface
of Keller et al [25], where a resonance calculation was also
performed and the resonances were assigned. Recently,
Poirier & Carrington [13] applied the above mentioned
PIST method to reproduce these results but with a sig-
niﬁcantly higher accuracy and numerical eﬃciency. We
use the latter results as a reference. Although, PIST is a

very eﬃcient alternative to the present technique, in our
study we do not make an adequate comparison of the two
methods as it would require the use of, at least, the same
basis set.

The present choice of the basis is the most primitive
direct-product Jacoby coordinate DVR grid, similar to
that used in ref. [24]. Several basis sets with various grid
sizes and cutoﬀ parameters were tested. The results re-
ported below correspond to a particular single set of pa-
rameters, which, as was veriﬁed empirically, provided ex-
tremely accurate results for the resonances in the energy
region below 9000 cm−1. In order to avoid an extensive
search for optimal basis set parameters, our strategy is
to use a larger and denser grid than may be necessary to
garantee high accuracy. This strategy is justiﬁed by a very
favorable numerical scaling of the present technique with
the basis size.

For RH−CO (the dissociation coordinate) we used 160
sinc-DVR [21] points in the interval [2, 8] a0, contracted
to NR = 40 points by means of the HEG [22] method
using the eigenfunctions of the 1D Hamiltonian deﬁned
by V (R) = minr,θV (Re, r, θ), where V (Re, r, θ) is the 3D
potential of HCO in the Jacoby coocrdinates. For the
rCO coordinate we used 64 sinc-DVR points in the interval
[1.8, 3.5] a0, contracted to Nr = 16 points. For the angu-
lar variable we used Nθ = 46 Gauss-Legendre-quadrature
DVR points. In order to reduce the Hamiltonian spectral
range ∆H we replaced the high values of the potential
by the cutoﬀ value Vcut = 25000 cm−1. This resulted in
∆H = 44654 cm−1. We note, that for the present ap-
proach the quality of the grid basis is measured by ∆H,
which directly aﬀects the convergence (cf. Eq. 47). Since
our basis is very primitive the spectral range is relatively
high. One may argue though that a primitive basis has
the advantage of minimizing the number of adjusting pa-
rameters and leads to a fast matrix-vector multiplication
for given grid size.

Here we report results corresponding to the three dif-
(I) N&M scheme with D0 deﬁned by
ferent schemes:
E0 = 9000 cm−1 (the maximum energy of interest), (II)
N&M scheme with D0 = 0, and (III) M&T scheme with
D0 = 0. (We note that the use of nonzero D0 in the M&T
scheme has almost no eﬀect as Re WE is already very small
in this case.)

For each scheme the damping potential has been taken
in the form (59) with RΩ = 5 a0. For this study we varied
the strength parameter λ in the range [0.0002, 0.6] with a
logarithmic distribution of 22 λ values.

For each λ an autocorrelation function y(t) (t =
0, ..., 2T = 20000) with a random initial vector was gener-
ated using T = 10000 matrix-vector multiplications. Cal-
culation of a single autocorrelation function takes 239 sec
on an Athlon 1.8 GHz pc using the gnu g77 Fortran com-
piler. Because the latter is very ineﬃcient, the reported
timing only gives a rough estimate of the algorithm eﬃ-

ciency. The autocorrelation functions were then inverted
by our quadruple-precision FDM code [26]. For a large
enough value of λ, the FDM results converge for most res-
onance states using T
7000, however, to maintain an
extremely high accuracy, especially for the lowest sharp
10−8 cm−1 and for
resonance
small λ values, we needed T
10000. (The eﬀective den-
≈
sity of states, that includes both the true resonance states
and states representing the continuum, becomes high for
small λ.) Of course, a smaller grid and lower Vcut would
result in a smaller ∆H reducing the needed number of it-
erations accordingly. Also note that because only small
generalized eigenvalue problems are encountered in FDM,
the cpu-time increase due to the use of the quadruple pre-
cision is not essential, while it improves the accuracy and
accelerates the convergence of the extracted eigenvalues
signiﬁcantly, compared to the double precision code. For
the present “toy problem” the harmonic inversion part is
as time-consuming (with quadruple precision) as the cor-
relation function generation, however, the former becomes
relatively negligible for bigger systems.

·

Let Eres
:= Re Ek deﬁne the positions and Γk :=
2 Im Ek, the widths of the resonances. The eigenvalue
−
trajectories Ek(λ) with Γk < 120 cm−1 are plotted in the
complex plane and the most stationary point (see above)
is assumed as the best resonance energy estimate. In Fig.
2 we show the eigenvalue trajectories generated using the
three diﬀerent damping schemes decribed above for two
states (a) with Eres = 3999.2, Γ = 32.8 cm−1 and (b)
10−6 cm−1. Schemes I and III
Eres = 1251.148, Γ = 1.8
result in quite diﬀerent trajectories for most λ values but
have easily identiﬁed stationary points (cusps) for about
the same value λ. These stationary points are very close to
each other. At the same time, scheme II gives more com-
plex trajectories that circle around the resonance position,
but have no well identiﬁed stationary point. Similar pat-
terns are observed for most other states. Note also, that for
some resonances the cusps may not exist, however having
the two types of trajectories helps one to better locate the
complex resonance energy by taking the point where the
trajectories of diﬀerent types approach each other. Fur-
thermore, scheme III generally results in sharpest cusps,
but because it corresponds to a smaller Re WE, it also
requires larger values of T for an accurate harmonic inver-
sion, as smaller Re WE corresponds to higher density of
states. For the same reason scheme II needs the smallest
T .

Surprisingly, for most resonances, the stationary point
in the eigenvalue trajectories are approached for the same
value λopt = 0.08, while only for a few extremely sharp
resonances near the dissociation threshold Edis = 1086
cm−1, the values Ek(λ = 0.08) give poor estimates of the
true complex resonance energies. For these states the op-
timal λ is a monotonically growing function of Eres

There is no simple way to determine the error bounds
other than by comparing the results using diﬀerent pa-
rameters. The accuracy in the positions of the resonances
varies depending mostly on Γk. It also depends in a less
systematic way on the quantum numbers. For narrow res-
1 cm−1 or less) the accuracy in the position
onances (Γk
is of the order of 0.01 cm−1 or better, while for the other
states with Γk < 100 cm−1 it is generally of the order of
0.1 cm−1. We believe, that generally the error in the re-
ported widths is less than 1%, although this may not be
true for some states.

played here as they are less accurate. Our results generally
agree very well with the results of Poirier & Carrington,

although some states are missing in the latter, such as
the broad resonance shown in Fig. 2: missing eigenvalues
are a common drawback of Lanczos based diagonalization
approaches. Note also that for the ﬁrst two sharp reso-
nances, Poirier & Carrington did not report reliable width
estimates.

Even though under the present circumstances a fair
comparison between the present approach and PIST [13]
is not possible (e.g., very diﬀerent basis sets were used in
the two cases), the following remarks seem appropriate.
At least for the HCO case, PIST appeared very eﬃcient
(required relatively few matrix-vector multiplications to
accurately compute the resonances) and relatively small
cpu-time, although the fact that it has more adjusting pa-
rameters than the present technique may be viewed as its
disadvantage. To conclude, the present approach, at least,
for the resonance calculations, appears very reliable, accu-
rate and eﬃcient. It requires a minimal number of adjust-
ing parameters and scales favorably with the size of the
system. The method is quite ﬂexible in the choice of the
damping scheme, but according to our tests an optimal
0.08.
choice corresponds to scheme I (see above) with λ

Eﬃcient and long-lived ﬁeld-free molecular orientation is achieved using only two kicks appro-
priately delayed in time. The understanding of the mechanism rests upon a molecular target state
providing the best eﬃciency versus persistence compromise. An optimal control scheme is referred
to for ﬁxing the free parameters (amplitudes and the time delay between them). The limited number
of kicks, the robustness and the transposability to diﬀerent molecular systems advocate in favor of
the process, when considering its experimental feasibility.

Molecular orientation,

in particular during the free
evolution of the system, has recently been abundantly
discussed in the literature as a process playing an im-
portant part in a variety of laser-molecule control issues,
among which are chemical reactivity [1], nanoscale de-
sign [2, 3], surface processing [4, 5], and attosecond time
scale pulse production [6, 7]. A basic mechanism by
which orientation is achieved involves sudden optical ex-
citation, such as half-cycle pulses (HCP), that impart a
kick to the molecule which orients itself along the polar-
ization vector of the linearly-polarized electromagnetic
ﬁeld (the kick mechanism) [8, 9].

Application of a series of kicks is in fact a gen-
eral control strategy that can enhance molecular align-
ment [10, 11] or even lead to a squeezing of atoms in an
optical lattice [12, 13]. Moreover, alignment by a pair
of pulses has been experimentally achieved [14, 15]. The
generic strategy, as ﬁrst suggested in Ref. [16], rests on
the application of a sudden impulse when a certain ob-
servable reaches a maximum (or minimum), such as the
expectation value of cos θ (which measures orientation, θ
being the angle positioning the molecular axis with re-
spect to the laser polarization) for the control of orienta-
tion.

In this paper we present a diﬀerent approach based on
a target state [17], instead of an observable, which al-
lows to consider not only the eﬃciency of the orientation
(hcos θi), but also its persistence. This stems from the
fact that, when dealing with ﬁeld-free orientation of a
molecule, a compromise between eﬃciency and duration
has to be looked for in the optimization criterion [18].
Although the generic strategy (i.e., kicking when an ob-
servable reaches its maximum value) can be applied also
to reach the target state [19], we show here, that this
strategy is far from optimal, and that two kicks can be
suﬃcient to come within 1% of the target state.

A diatomic molecule illuminated by a moderate ampli-
tude HCP is described within a model of a rigid rotor in-

teracting with the ﬁeld through its permanent dipole (po-
larizability interaction neglected). The time-dependent
Schr¨odinger equation (TDSE) accounting for the time
evolution of the system is (in atomic units)

d
dt

i

(1)

ψ(θ, ϕ; t) = hB ˆJ 2 − ~µ0 · ~ǫE(t)i ψ(θ, ϕ; t),
where the molecule is described by its rotational constant
B and permanent dipole moment ~µ0, and the HCP is
characterized by its amplitude E(t) and unit polarization
vector ~ǫ. ˆJ is the angular momentum operator. The wave
function involves two angular variables: the polar θ and
azimuthal ϕ angles. Due to cylindrical symmetry around
~ǫ, the motion associated with the azimuthal angle ϕ is
completely separated and is not considered hereafter. As
a consequence, the projection quantum number M of ~J
on ~ǫ is ﬁxed. The polar angle θ takes part (apart from the
analytical characterization of ˆJ 2) in the dot product ~µ0 ·~ǫ
in Eq. (1), through its cosine. The short duration τ of
the HCP, as compared to the molecular rotational period
Trot = π/B, is accounted for through a dimensionless
small parameter ε = τ /Trot = τ B/π less than one. A
time scaling is achieved [20, 21] by introducing a variable
s = t/Trot (s ∈ [0, ε] during the HCP pulse), leading to
the following form of the TDSE (1)

ψ(θ, ϕ; s) = hπ ˆJ 2 − E(s) cos θi ψ(θ, ϕ; s),

where E(s) = π µ0

where the small perturbation parameter is the duration
of the pulse ε, provides the wave packet at time s, as a
result of successive applications of two unitary evolution
operators on the initial state ψ(θ, ϕ; s = 0) (taken as a
pure quantum state),

ψ(θ, ϕ; s) ≃ U0(s)Uaψ(θ, ϕ; s = 0),

with A =
0 E(s)ds a dimensionless parameter combin-
ing molecule and ﬁeld characteristics, integrated over the
whole pulse duration. The initial molecular pure quan-
tum state is taken as the isotropic spherical harmonic
YJ=M=0(θ, ϕ). The dynamical picture, which emerges
from Eqs. (3)–(5) for a single HCP, is that a unitary oper-
ator Ua imparts a kick, measured in terms of a strength A
times cos θ, to the molecule in its initial state. This pro-
duces a rotational excitation bringing the molecule from a
completely isotropic angular distribution to a more ori-
ented conﬁguration. The further ﬁeld-free evolution is
monitored by U0(s). In the case where a series of HCPs
is considered, the evolution operators U0(s)Ua have to be
applied for each individual pulse, taking into account the
time delays between each. It is also worthwhile noting
that introducing the dimensionless parameters ε, A and
variable s helps to free oneself from a speciﬁc molecule-
plus-ﬁeld system. Actually, molecular and ﬁeld charac-
teristics are combined in such a way that a large rota-
tional constant B can be overcome by a shorter pulse
duration τ , the relevant condition being ε ≪ 1. Simi-
larly, a small permanent dipole µ0 can be overcome by
a stronger ﬁeld amplitude E, the relevant parameter A
being proportional to the product µ0E/B. As for the
rescaling of time, it gives access to results in terms of a
dimensionless time s that is taken as a fraction of the
rotational period, which again is molecule independent.
A measure of orientation is given by the dynamical

expectation value of cos θ, i.e.,

hcos θi (s) = hψ(θ, ϕ; s)| cos θ |ψ(θ, ϕ; s)i ,

(6)

the optimization of the orientation being in relation with
the maximization (or minimization) of hcos θi (s). We
have recently developed a generic strategy that, when
applied to cos θ taken as an operator, can be summarized
as following [17]:

(i) The physical Hilbert space in which cos θ is acting
is reduced to a ﬁnite subspace H(N ) of dimension N . The
expectation value of the projection of cos θ on this sub-
space is time periodic and can be represented, in the basis
of spherical harmonics, as a ﬁnite N ×N -dimensional ma-
trix with discretized, bounded eigenvectors (as opposed
to cos θ which has a continuous spectrum).

(ii) A target state can be deﬁned as the eigenstate of
the projection of cos θ on H(N ) corresponding to its high-
est (or lowest) eigenvalue. Such a state can be explicitly
calculated, in the basis of spherical harmonics, by diag-
onalizing the corresponding matrix. The full advantage
of the dimensionality reduction remains in the fact that
a smaller N involves a lower rotational excitation that
allows for a longer duration of the orientation after the
pulse is over (see Fig. 1 of Ref. [17]). The most excit-
ing observation is that a target state calculated within

2

a subspace as small (with respect to dimensionality) as
N = 5 already leads to an excellent orientation eﬃciency
of hcos θi ∼ 0.9. In other words, the target state fulﬁlls
the two requirements of the orientation control problem,
and in that respect is far superior to all other intuitive
criteria that have been previously used [18].

(iii) A strategy is proposed to reach this target state
by applying a series of identical short pulses at times
when hcos θi reaches its maximum (or minimum) follow-
ing ﬁeld-free evolution. Consequently, the corresponding
wave function converges to the target state. The robust-
ness of the strategy has been checked against the pulse
strength and the time delays. For completeness, we have
also to mention a similar strategy (leading to similar re-
sults) that consists in applying the pulses every time the
projection of the time-evolved wave packet reaches its
maximal projection on the target state.

From this theory, that can actually be generically
transposed to other control
issues, the recipes that
emerge for a possible control of molecular orientation is
the application of a train of short and identical pulses
with a given total area (within 10 to 15% of accuracy) and
respecting predetermined time delays between successive
pulses (within 10% of accuracy). For typical cases, 10 to
20 pulses with A = 1 are necessary to reach the target
state. But obviously this strategy taken as a whole (with
the values of the time delays, the number of pulses and
their integrated amplitude A) is not unique. However,
it indicates that a train of short, time-delayed pulses
induces a repeated kick mechanism at speciﬁc molecu-
lar response times that improves the eﬃciency and the
duration of orientation. It is precisely this information
that serves here as a basis for a numerical optimal con-
trol scheme conducted using an evolutionary strategy
(ES) [22].

The target state being clearly identiﬁed, the optimiza-
tion aims to maximize the projection of the instanta-
neous wave packet on the target. More precisely, the
wave packet at time s being expanded on the basis of
spherical harmonics YJ,M=0(θ, ϕ) as

ψ(θ, ϕ; s) =

cJ (s)YJ,M=0(θ, ϕ),

(7)

the probability to be maximized is

(s) · ctarget|2 ,

(8)

where c∗(s) ≡ (c∗
1(s), . . . , ) and ctarget is the cor-
responding column vector of the weighting coeﬃcients of
the target state on the same basis of spherical harmonics.
The ES deal as usual with the minimization of a criterion
deﬁned here as

j ≡ 1 − P (si(Pmax)),

(9)

where si(Pmax) is the time for which P reaches a max-
imum during the free evolution over a rotational period

following the radiative interaction. The parameters of
the optimization are the amplitudes (A) and time inter-
vals characterizing a train of kicks that can be produced
by HCPs. The ES is implemented using the Evolving
Objects library (EOlib) [23, 24].

All the calculations that are presented here deal with
a target state in a N = 5-dimensional ﬁnite subspace
H(5)(the maximum allowed rotational excitation Jmax =
4 being the one previously retained as satisfying the
best post-pulse orientation eﬃciency/duration compro-
mise [17]). The wave packet by itself is propagated in
a larger, although ﬁnite, subspace and thus may reach
higher rotational states. The optimal control strategy is
guided by two diﬀerent approaches, depending upon the
parameter space chosen.

A. Time delays as the only parameters. For a
given number of pulses, the only task conferred to the ES
algorithm is the optimal determination of the time delays
between the pulses for a minimization of j [Eq. (9)]. The
pulses are considered identical, with all other parameters
taken such that A = 1. The results for 3 and 4 pulses are
displayed in tables I and II, collecting the values of the
time delays δi between pulses i and i + 1 and their times
of application si, together with the values reached for
P (si(Pmax)) after each successive kick. Are also given the
time intervals δi(cosmax) and δi(Pmax) between the ith
kick and the next maxima of hcos θi (s) and of P (s), re-
spectively, for comparison with the strategies of Ref. [17].
Concerning the three-pulse model of Tab. I, two obser-
vations can be made, showing that the general theory
of Ref. [17], as summarized above, is neither unique nor
optimal. A value of P = 0.8905 is reached using the op-
timal time delays δi, far better than the one that can be
reached by applying the kicks precisely at the maxima of
hcos θi (s), yielding P = 0.5277. The comparison between
δi’s and si and sPi’s shows that the optimal strategy is to
apply the pulses before the maxima of hcos θi (s) or the
minima of P (s). The situation is diﬀerent for the 4-pulse
model, Tab. II, advocating again for the non-uniqueness
of the solution. The second pulse in particular is applied
after a time delay δ2 larger than si or sPi . An excel-

lent value for P is obtained, showing that after 4 pulses
the molecular state that is reached is close to the tar-
get within 2%. But, even more interestingly, the third
and fourth pulses are applied at times very close to one
rotational period (i.e., δ3 = 0.99, δ4 = 0.00) after the
second kick. Due to the periodicity, this amounts to ap-
plying simultaneously three identical pulses after a time
delay δ2 corresponding to the second pulse. Still another
way of analyzing the situation consists in applying a ﬁrst
pulse with an amplitude A1 = 1.0 and after a time de-
lay of δ2 = 0.2388 applying a second pulse of amplitude
A2 = 3.0. Such a strategy has actually been checked and
leads to a ﬁnal projection P = 0.9776, very close to the
one displayed in Tab. II, i.e., P = 0.9787.

We note that a similar result is also obtained with ﬁve
kicks, allowing then to reach P = 0.9928. Better results
are not reached with more kicks as the subsequent ones
have the counter eﬀect of increasing the rotational excita-
tion, and thus of pushing the system outside the Hilbert
space H(5) where the target resides.

B. Time delays and amplitudes as parameters.
Referring again to the strategy of implementing in the
ES what is learned from previous attempts, we extend
the parameter space such as to account for the variation
of both the time delays δi and the amplitudes Ai.
In
addition, we restrict the optimization scheme to a 2-pulse
model, which results into the rather simpliﬁed task for
the ES of providing merely with 3 parameters: A1, A2,
and δ2.

The optimization then yields the strategy of giving a
ﬁrst kick of amplitude A1 = 0.9741, followed by the sec-
ond of amplitude A2 = 3.2930 after a delay δ2 = 0.2419,
allowing to reach P = 0.9886. This conﬁrms the previ-
ous observations: the target state is easily reached using
only two pulses and the intensity of the kicks must be re-
strained so that highly excited rotational states are not
populated. The resulting time evolution of hcos θi is given
in Fig. 1, where the angular ditribution at maximum ori-
entation is also shown. A value of hcos θi = 0.9078 is
reached, slightly greater than that of the target (0.9062).
We point out that, were it ploted on the same graph at
this scale, the target state would be virtually indistin-

setting up the evolutionary strategies.

guishable from the distribution reached.

We have checked the robustness of this strategy by
varying the parameters by 10% of their optimal value.
The smallest value of P obtained is then 0.9689, so the
results remains quite close to the target. Orientation
eﬃciency remains within 2.2%, whereas its duration is
shorten by at most 9%.

In conclusion, using evolutionary strategies, we found
the optimal way to kick a molecule with short HCPs in
order to reach a target state corresponding to an oriented
molecule. The solution turns out to be very eﬃcient, al-
lowing to reach the target state (within 1%) with only
two pulses, instead of the approximately 15 pulses of the
previous mathematically built (but not unique) strategy
of Ref. [17] for the same system. This advocates for great
experimental feasibility and, even more importantly, it
points out the broad interest of the overall methodology.
As has been already shown, the mathematically clear de-
piction of a quantum target state in a ﬁnite dimensional
subspace can be conducted for a large class of observ-
ables (some examples in comparing systems interacting
with a thermal baths or other dissipative environments
are provided in Ref. [25]). Once the target state is de-
ﬁned, ES can be successfully run with a simple criterion
of maximum projection on the target state referring as a
basic mechanism to a train of kicks. The only parameters
to be optimized are the time delays and amplitudes. A
small number of such kicks, reachable within modest ex-
perimental environment, allow for a remarkably eﬃcient
and persistent control.

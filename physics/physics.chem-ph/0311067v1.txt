Abstract

We are proposing a new computational thermochemistry protocol denoted W3 theory, as a suc-

cessor to W1 and W2 theory proposed earlier [Martin and De Oliveira, J. Chem. Phys. 111, 1843

(1999)]. The new method is both more accurate overall (error statistics for total atomization ener-

gies approximately cut in half) and more robust (particularly towards systems exhibiting signiﬁcant

nondynamical correlation) than W2 theory. The cardinal improvement rests in an approximate

account for post-CCSD(T) correlation eﬀects.

Iterative T3 (connected triple excitations) eﬀects

exhibit a basis set convergence behavior similar to the T3 contribution overall. They almost uni-

versally decrease molecular binding energies. Their inclusion in isolation yields less accurate results

than CCSD(T) nearly across the board: it is only when T4 (connected quadruple excitations) eﬀects

are included that superior performance is achieved. T4 eﬀects systematically increase molecular

binding energies. Their basis set convergence is quite rapid, and even CCSDTQ/cc-pVDZ scaled

by an empirical factor of 1.2532 will yield a quite passable quadruples contribution. The eﬀect

of still higher-order excitations was gauged for a subset of molecules (notably the eight-valence

electron systems): T5 (connected quintuple excitations) contributions reach 0.3 kcal/mol for the

pathologically multireference X 1Σ+

g state of C2 but are quite small for other systems. A variety

of avenues for achieving accuracy beyond that of W3 theory were explored, to no signiﬁcant avail.

W3 thus appears to represent a good compromise between accuracy and computational cost for

those seeking a robust method for computational thermochemistry in the kJ/mol accuracy range

on small systems.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Computational thermochemistry has come of age in recent years[1]. The available tech-

niques represent various trade-oﬀs between accuracy and computational cost.

The “Gaussian-n” (Gn) family of methods[2] ﬁrst brought ‘black box’ thermochemistry

for small molecules in the kcal/mol range: yet errors for individual systems can still exceed

the average over their training sets by as much as an order of magnitude. Gn theory relies

on relatively small basis sets, additivity approximations, and empirical corrections.

Similar remarks apply to the CBS (“complete basis set”) family of methods by Petersson

and coworkers[3], which involve intricate combinations of pair correlation extrapolations and

empirical corrections.

Some years ago, one of us proposed two new computational thermochemistry protocols

named W1 and W2 theory [4, 5] that had the following design goals:

• mean absolute error over various training sets in the kJ/mol range

• worst-case errors in the 1 kcal/mol range, except for truly pathological systems

• completely devoid of empirical parameters

• explicitly including all eﬀects that aﬀect molecular binding energies in at least the

kJ/mol range for ﬁrst-and second-row systems, such as core-valence correlation, scalar

relativistic eﬀects, and ﬁrst-order spin-orbit coupling

• still be eﬃcient enough for application to systems with up to six heavy atoms on a

fast commodity computer

An extensive validation study[6] revealed these goals to be fundamentally met. Recently,

an extension to systems with very small valence-subvalence gaps (such as alkali and alkaline

earth metal compounds) has been proposed[7]. Yet Ref.[6], and our general experience,

revealed two main Achilles’ heels to the method:

1. As the nonrelativistic parts of W1 and W2 theory both represent extrapolations[8, 9]

to the CCSD(T) basis set limit, the methods are intrinsically prone to failure for

systems suﬀering from moderate to strong nondynamical correlation eﬀects

3

2. The scalar relativistic treatment is based on one-electron Darwin and mass-velocity

corrections[10]. While this approach is easily implemented and expected to work well

for ﬁrst-and second-row systems, application of W1 and W2 theory to heavier element

systems will require a more rigorous relativistic treatment such as the Douglas-Kroll-

Hess[11, 12] approximation.

In the present paper, we shall investigate these and some ancillary issues, focusing par-

ticularly on CCSD(T) insuﬃciency. We shall propose a new member of the Wn family

called W3 theory, which should be capable of handling cases where W1 and W2 theory fail.

Furthermore, we will report on some avenues we explored in seeking further improvements

compared to W3 theory.

II. COMPUTATIONAL DETAILS

Electronic structure calculations at the CCSD (coupled cluster with all single and double

substitutions[13]) and CCSD(T) (CCSD with quasiperturbative triple excitations[14, 15])

levels were carried out using MOLPRO 2002.6 [16] running on an Intel/Linux cluster in our

group. Electronic structure calculations at the CCSDT (coupled cluster with all single, dou-

ble, and triple substitutions), CCSDTQ (coupled cluster with all single, double, triple and

quadruple substitutions), CCSDTQ5 (ditto with added connected quintuple substitutions)

and full conﬁguration interaction (FCI) levels were carried out using the generalized CI/CC

code developed by one of us[17, 18, 19]. The latter was interfaced to the atomic orbital

integrals, self-consistent ﬁeld (SCF), and integral transformation parts of the Austin/Mainz

version of ACES II [20] which was also itself employed for some of the CCSDT calculations.

ROHF (restricted open-shell Hartree-Fock) reference determinants were used throughout for

open-shell systems: the deﬁnition of the ROHF-CCSD(T) energy according to Ref.[15] was

employed throughout. All calculations were carried out using the ‘frozen core approxima-

tion’, except those using core-valence correlation basis sets.

Most basis sets employed belong to the correlation consistent family of Dunning and

coworkers[21]. Unless indicated otherwise, we have combined the regular cc-pVXZ (correla-

tion consistent polarized valence X-tuple zeta[22]) basis set on hydrogen with aug-cc-pVXZ

([diﬀuse function] augmented cc-pVXZ[23]) on B–Ne and, on Al–Ar, the aug-cc-pV(X+d)Z

basis sets (aug-cc-pVXZ with additional high-exponent d function) of Dunning, Peterson,

4

and Wilson[24]. For convenience, we will denote this combination by the abbreviation AVXZ

throughout the present paper. The abbreviation PVXZ will refer to the combination of reg-

ular cc-pVXZ basis sets on H and B–Ne with cc-pV(X+d)Z on Al–Ar.

Most core correlation calculations were carried out with the MTsmall (Martin-Taylor

small[4]) basis set, which is a completely uncontracted cc-pVTZ basis set with 2d1f high-

exponent functions added. Additional core correlation calculations were performed using

the cc-pwCVXZ (correlation consistent polarized weighted core-valence X-tuple zeta) basis

sets of Peterson and Dunning[25].

In a slight departure from W2 theory, and for consistency with the other basis sets

used, reference geometries were obtained at the CCSD(T)/cc-pV(Q+d)Z level. Zero-point

vibrational energies (ZPVEs), obtained from experimental or high-level ab initio harmonic

frequencies and anharmonic corrections, were taken from Ref.[4] unless indicated otherwise.

Unless indicated otherwise, extrapolations to the inﬁnite basis set limit for correlation

energies are carried out using the same simple formula[9] employed in W2 theory[4], E(L) =

E∞ + a/L3, where L is the maximum angular momentum represented in the basis set (2 for

AVDZ, 3 for AVTZ, 4 for AVQZ, 5 for AV5Z, and 6 for AV6Z). This formula is based on

the leading term in the partial wave expansion of singlet-coupled pair energies[26]. For the

SCF energy, the same E(L) = E∞ + a/L5 as in W2 theory was employed.

INITIAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

A.

Importance of connected quintuple and higher excitations

Ruden et al.[27] noted that connected quintuple excitations, i.e. CCSDTQ5 - CCSDTQ,

account for up to 0.3 kJ/mol to the dissociation energy of N2 in a cc-pVDZ basis set.

Bartlett and coworkers[28] noted that connected quintuples contribute as much as 1 cm−1

to the harmonic frequency of N2. While explicit inclusion of connected quintuples would be

computationally prohibitive for all but the very smallest systems, we should at least verify

whether and to what extent connected quintuple and higher excitations could become an

issue. We considered (a) the atomic electron aﬃnities (EAs); (b) the dissociation energies

of the eight-valence electron diatomics C2 , BN, BeO and MgO, along with the B2 diatomic.

The largest FCI/AVDZ - CCSDTQ5/AVDZ diﬀerence, 0.07 meV, is found for EA(O);

5

all others are an order of magnitude less, or zero by deﬁnition. We can safely state that

an error of 70 µeV is of no concern to most thermochemical applications, and hence that

connected sextuple and higher excitations can be safely neglected.

For the atomic EAs, the largest CCSDTQ5/AVTZ - CCSDTQ/AVTZ diﬀerences are

found for oxygen (0.87 meV) and nitrogen (0.55 meV). Turning to the eight-valence electron

tireference X 1Σ+

systems, by far the largest contribution there (0.32 kcal/mol) is for the pathologically mul-
g state of the C2 molecule. For the a3Πu state this drops to 0.14 kcal/mol;
for the closed-shell singlet states of BN, BeO, and MgO, we obtain +0.16, -0.11, and -

0.04 kcal/mol, respectively. Finally, connected quintuples contribute +0.08 kcal/mol to the

binding energy of B2 and +0.13 kcal/mol to that of the CN radical.

As the asymptotic CPU time scaling of a CCSDTQ5 calculation is proportional to n5N 7

(with n the number of electrons correlated and N the number of virtual orbitals), a quin-

tuples correction will be unfeasible in all but the very smallest systems. Given that the

resulting error is in the fractional kJ/mol range, we consider its neglect an acceptable price

to pay for extending the applicability range of W3.

B.

Importance of connected quadruple excitations

The importance of connected quadruple excitations, CCSDTQ - CCSDT, as a function of

basis set is displayed in Tables I and II. Ruden et al.[27] previously noted their importance

for a much smaller set of systems.

First of all, connected quadruples systematically increase binding energies as well as

ionization potentials (IPs) and electron aﬃnities (EAs).

Secondly, contributions in systems with signiﬁcant nondynamical correlation eﬀects can

be quite nontrivial. At the extrapolated basis set limit, we ﬁnd contributions of 2.31 and 2.05

kcal/mol, respectively, in the closed-shell singlet states of C2 and BN, and 1.81 kcal/mol for

MgO. With just a PVDZ basis set, we ﬁnd 1.75 kcal/mol for N2O, 1.71 kcal/mol for NO2,

and 3.21 kcal/mol for O3. Clearly, contributions of that magnitude are ignored at one’s

peril.

Thirdly, while basis set convergence is quite rapid, it is not uniform. Convergence in

systems like C2 is deﬁnitely much slower than in, e.g., H2O. The case of C2 is somewhat

special as the zero-order wave function is nearly biconﬁgurational, and connected quadruples

6

relative to the HF-SCF determinant are eﬀectively double excitations with respect to the

dominant doubly excited determinant.

Considering the asymptotic n4N 6 CPU time scaling of a CCSDTQ calculation, it would

be very desirable if it could be carried out in just a PVDZ basis set, perhaps with the use

of a scaling factor determined from the PVDZ/(basis set limit) ratio in a training set of

systems. (We chose the set of all systems in Table II for which we were able to do CCSDTQ

calculations in at least a PVTZ basis set.) This approach would seem to work at least

tolerably well for many systems, but will not be universally applicable. Not only in cases

with a low-lying doubly excited state like C2 will there be a problem, but it can readily be

seen from Table II that the T4 contributions for H2O and HF go through a minimum as a

function of the basis set. (This is the case for the atomic electron aﬃnities of O and F as

well, as well as for the T4 contributions to the atomic correlation energies. We suspect the

issue to be speciﬁc to these small and very highly electronegative elements.)

One reason why correlation consistent basis sets have overwhelmingly supplanted atomic

natural orbital basis sets is the much shorter integral evaluation times for the former[29] and

that they tend to perform comparably for most applications. However, the fractional integral

evaluation time of a CCSDTQ calculation is so ridiculously small that it may make sense

to use the best possible basis set for a given contracted size. We considered the averaged

ANO basis sets of Roos and coworkers[30], and found that the smallest ANO contraction

that yields acceptable results is [4s3p1d] (ANO431 for short). On the one hand, we ﬁnd

the [4s3p1d]/(basis set limit) ratio for the T4 contribution to be much more consistent, and

hence it is much more amenable to scaling. On the other hand, even the four additional basis

functions per nonhydrogen atom (relative to PVDZ) already make the O3 molecule nearly

intractable on our presently available computational hardware. (The CCSDTQ/ANO431

calculation required 436 million determinants, compared to a ‘mere’ 111 million for CCS-

DTQ/PVDZ.)

In an attempt to eliminate the very costly CCSDTQ calculations, we considered various

continued-fraction and Pad´e type approximations proposed by Goodson [31]. Like a previous

study of Feller and coworkers[32], we ﬁnd these approximations to behave too erratically for

practical use, and we have abandoned them.

7

C.

Importance of higher-order connected triple substitutions

Higher-order T3 contributions — as measured by the CCSDT - CCSD(T) diﬀerence —

are tabulated in Table I for atomic ionization potentials and electron aﬃnities, and in Table

III for molecular total atomization energies of our training set.

With a few exceptions (e.g., B2 and CH) the contributions at the basis set limit system-

atically reduce molecular binding energies. Thus, as previously suggested by Bak et al.[33],

the surprisingly good performance of CCSD(T) (and, indeed, of W2 theory) is largely due

to partial error compensation between neglect of T4 and iterative T3 eﬀects.

Basis set convergence is considerably slower than for T4.

In particular, contributions

generally have a positive sign with the PVDZ basis set and change sign as the basis set

is expanded. Considering that the contribution is itself 1–2 orders of magnitude smaller

than the (T) contribution to molecular binding energies, we can probably get away with

E∞ + a/L3 extrapolation[9] from AVDZ and AVTZ basis sets, thus keeping CPU times for
the CCSDT step (asymptotically proportional to n3N 5) within acceptable boundaries.

D.

Improved scalar relativistic correction

In order to achieve greater robustness for heavier element systems, we replaced the scalar

relativistic treatment of W1 and W2 theory — ﬁrst-order Darwin and mass-velocity (DMV)

corrections[10] taken as expectation values from an averaged coupled pair functional[34]

(ACPF) wave function with the ‘Martin-Taylor small’ (MTsmall) basis set[4] — by a more

rigorous one. Speciﬁcally, the scalar relativistic contribution is taken as the diﬀerence be-

tween the second-order Douglas-Kroll-CCSD(T)/aug′-cc-pRVQZ (ARVQZ for short) and

nonrelativistic CCSD(T)/aug′-cc-pVQZ energies, where cc-pRVXZ stands for newly devel-

oped relativistic correlation consistent X-tuple zeta basis sets[35]. (The preﬁx ‘aug′’ de-

notes a basis set augmented with diﬀuse functions on the main group elements but not on

hydrogen[36].) A comparison between this approach and the original DMV-ACPF/MTsmall

treatment can be found in Table IV.

The bottom line is that the ACPF Darwin and mass-velocity approach, while generally

eﬀective for ﬁrst-and second-row systems, can actually cause noticeable errors even for SO2,

and cannot be blindly relied upon for heavier elements.

8

Also, as seen from Table IV, the relativistic correction with the VQZ type basis sets is

basically indistinguishable from the basis set limit.

E.

Improved extrapolation to the inﬁnite-basis valence correlation limit

triplet-coupled (as ET

Klopper[37] proposed separate extrapolations of singlet-coupled (as ES

∞ + aSL−3) and
∞ + aT L−5) pair correlation energies, corresponding to the leading
terms of the partial wave asymptotic expansions for such pairs[26]. The term linear in T1

in the CCSD energy equation (which is nonzero for open-shell CCSD calculations using

semicanonical orbitals, such as done by MOLPRO[38]) is then simply taken as that in the

largest available basis set. Some results can be found in Table V.

When extrapolating from AVQZ and AV5Z basis sets, separate extrapolation system-

atically produces lower basis set limits than joint extrapolation. Diﬀerences are by and

large in the 0.1 kcal/mol range, but reach 0.16–0.18 kcal/mol for HOCl, N2O, and Cl2, 0.2

kcal/mol for CO2 and OCS, and 0.3 kcal/mol for SO2. When extrapolating from AV(5+d)Z

and AV(6+d)Z basis sets, these discrepancies are greatly reduced: this reﬂects the triplet-

coupled pair energies being largely converged, leaving the singlet-coupled pair energies to

dominate convergence behavior. Furthermore, diﬀerences between the {AVQZ,AV5Z} and

{AV5Z,AV6Z} extrapolated limits are appreciable (e.g., 0.3 kcal/mol for Cl2) using joint ex-

trapolation, and much smaller using separate extrapolation — clearly suggesting the latter

to have more desirable convergence properties. On the other hand, using AVTZ and AVQZ

basis sets, the separate extrapolation is clearly performing more poorly than the empirically

damped (exponent 3.22) joint extrapolation used in W1 theory[4].

As the (T) contribution is both smaller to begin with than the CCSD correlation energy

and converges more rapidly with the basis set[39], standard W2w theory extrapolates it

from AVTZ and AVQZ basis sets. (In this manner, the largest basis set calculation in W2w

is just a CCSD calculation and can be carried out using integral-direct algorithms where

necessary[40].) We considered the eﬀect of extrapolating the (T) contribution from larger

AVQZ and AV5Z basis sets (Table V), and found it to be below 0.1 kcal/mol in all cases

and below 0.05 kcal/mol in most species.

As to the SCF component, the eﬀect of extrapolating from AV5Z and AV6Z basis sets

is negligible at our target accuracy level, with the notable exception of SO2 where inner

9

polarization functions are known to be very important[41]. We attempted SCF calculations

in even larger basis sets than aug-cc-pV(6+d)Z (particularly aug-cc-pV6Z+2d1f), and ﬁnd

out best Hartree-Fock limit to be 121.93±0.04 kcal/mol, in between the {AVQZ,AV5Z} and

{AV5Z,AV6Z} extrapolated values.

Finally, we considered basis set superposition error (BSSE). Among the diﬀerent many-

body generalizations[42, 43, 44] of the counterpoise correction[45], we have followed the

’site-site function counterpoise’ deﬁnition of Wells and Wilson[42]. The results are given in

Table VI. We note that valence BSSEs are fairly noticeable for the individual basis sets up

to even the AV6Z level, but are largely annihilated by the extrapolation.

F.

Improved inner-shell correlation contribution

In the original W1/W2 paper, it was established that connected triple excitations are

quite important (relatively speaking) in the core-valence contribution to molecular binding

energies. As a result, CPU times in especially W1 calculations on second-row molecules and

large ﬁrst-row molecules are dominated by the inner-shell correlation step, and we had a

vested interest in keeping the core correlation basis set as small as possible. The smallest

basis set that could reliably reproduce them was found to be what we termed the MTsmall

basis set[4]. As we are ’tightening the screws’ everywhere else, it makes sense to explore the

importance of better core correlation basis sets, especially considering the in any case steep

computational cost of the CCSDTQ valence calculations.

Core-valence correlation contributions with the core-valence weighted[25] aug′-cc-

pwCVTZ and aug′-cc-pwCVQZ basis sets, as well as extrapolations to the inﬁnite-basis

limit, can be found in Table VII. In addition, we considered the eﬀect of basis set super-

position error on the inner shell contribution, following a suggestion by Bauschlicher and

Ricca[46] that it might become quite important for second-row systems.

We found a serious issue with BSSE for SO2 (0.85 kcal/mol with the smaller basis set),

but even here simple a + b/L3 extrapolation basically eliminates the problem.

10

G. Use of Wilson’s second-row basis sets

The original W1 and W2 methods added high-exponent 2d1f sets to second-row basis

sets in order to cope with polarization of the (3s,3p) inner loops[41, 47, 48]. These basis sets

do guarantee saturation of the HF-SCF energy even in extreme cases like SO3 (where inner

polarization contributes 10 kcal/mol to the HF-SCF binding energy even with an aug-cc-

pVQZ basis set[49]). Recently, however, Wilson and coworkers[24] published new so-called

cc-pV(n+d)Z basis sets that are designed to cope with the phenomenon in a consistent way.

As these basis sets only have an extra d function compared to cc-pVnZ, they represent a

potential cost savings of 12 basis functions per second-row atom compared to regular W2

theory. We have considered a minor variant on the latter (which we term W2w theory), in

which aug′-cc-pV(n+d)Z basis sets are used throughout instead of aug′-cc-pVnZ+2d1f. (For

the geometry optimizations, cc-pV(T+d)Z and cc-pV(Q+d)Z are employed instead of their

counterparts.) A comparison with regular W2 theory can be found in the Supplementary

Material[50]: the two methods perform equivalently, and individual discrepancies for second-

row molecules are very small.

IV. DEFINITION OF W3 THEORY; ATTEMPTED DEFINITIONS OF W4 THE-

ORY

introduced:

W3 theory is intended to yield the greatest possible improvement over W2 and W2w

theory at the lowest cost possible. Relative to W2w theory, the following changes are

• the new Douglas-Kroll based scalar relativistic correction was introduced

• the eﬀect of iterative T3 excitations was estimated from the CCSDT–CCSD(T) diﬀer-

ence with cc-pVDZ and cc-pVTZ basis sets, then extrapolated as a + bL−3

• the eﬀect of connected quadruple excitations was estimated as the CCSDTQ-CCSDT

diﬀerence with the cc-pVDZ basis set, scaled by a factor of 1.2532 derived by least-

squares ﬁtting to the best available T4 limits over our training set of molecules

We additionally considered two minor modiﬁcations. In the ﬁrst — denoted W3A theory in

this paper — the T4 contribution is computed at the CCSDTQ/ANO431 level and scaled by

11

1.275 (scale factor obtained in same manner). In the second — denoted W3K theory in this

paper — the CCSD valence correlation extrapolation is carried out separately on ‘singlet’

and ‘triplet’ pair correlation energies, as originally advocated by Klopper[37] (hence the

acronym).

sets

In addition, we considered two attempts at a W4 method, which we will denote here as

W4a and W4b. Relative to W3 theory, the following changes are introduced:

• the higher-order T3 eﬀect is instead extrapolated from cc-pVTZ and cc-pVQZ basis

• in W4a theory, the T4 contribution is computed in the cc-pVTZ basis set and scaled

by 1.13, the scale factor being obtained in the same way as for W3 theory

• in W4b theory, the T4 contribution is instead extrapolated from the CCSDTQ–CCSDT

diﬀerence with cc-pVDZ and cc-pVTZ basis sets

• the inner-shell correlation contribution is extrapolated from CCSD(T)/aug′-cc-

pwCVTZ and CCSD(T)/aug′-cc-pwCVQZ results

• the SCF and valence CCSD contributions are extrapolated from AV5Z and AV6Z basis

set combinations

• the valence (T) contribution from AVQZ and AV5Z basis set combinations

V. PERFORMANCE OF W3 THEORY

We have considered the W2-1 dataset for atomization energies, minus the H2 molecule

(for which W2 and W3 are trivially equivalent) and expanded with the ozone, N2O, and

NO2 molecules. In addition, we have considered subsets of the G2-1 and G2-2 testsets for

ionization potentials and electron aﬃnities. Unless indicated otherwise, experimental data

are the same as those in the W2 validation paper[6]. That is, ionization potentials and

electron aﬃnities were generally taken from the latest edition of the WebBook[51], while

with one exception, atomization energies viz. heats of formation were critically compiled

from a variety of sources in Ref.[6]. (The exception is the CH diatomic radical, for which a

recent exhaustive computational study[52] has shown that the accepted dissociation energy

is too low by 0.16 kcal/mol.)

12

It was previously shown[5] that for W2 theory, the use of anharmonic zero-point energies

noticeably improves the mean absolute error: this will be true a fortiori for W3 theory. All

such ZPVEs were taken from Ref.[4] except for two: ozone (vide infra) and ammonia. For

this latter molecule, a zero-point energy that properly accounts for the umbrella mode has

very recently become available from the work of Halonen and coworkers[53]: the value of

21.165 kcal/mol is slightly smaller than the 21.33 kcal/mol computed from the Martin, Lee,

and Taylor[54] quartic force ﬁeld, used in our previous work.

A.

Ionization potentials

Performance of W2 theory for ionization potentials was quite good already, and this prop-

erty is fairly easy to reproduce computationally in any case. As can be seen in Table VIII,

W3 theory achieves the most signiﬁcant improvements for CN, CH2 and for N2, reﬂecting

diﬀerential static correlation contributions in these systems that W3 is better able to cope

with. Results for CO and CS are likewise almost spot-on. Molecules already treated well

by W2 are likewise treated well by W3. P2 and NH2 display signiﬁcant diﬀerences from

experiment at the W2 as well as W3 levels, suggesting that the experimental values may

be considerably less reliable than their stated uncertainty. The WebBook lists a plethora of

alternate experimental data for these molecules, spanning a wide range.

Performance for the atomic IPs, which are very precisely known experimentally, is quite

satisfying for W3 theory, although performance for second-row elements is clearly inferior

to that for the ﬁrst row. We have considered extrapolations from larger basis sets, post-

CCSD(T) valence correlation contributions extrapolated from the largest basis sets available

(AVTZ and AVQZ), core-valence correlation contributions using larger basis sets,... and

found no signiﬁcant improvement. One eﬀect we are unable to cover are post-CCSD(T)

contributions to the core-valence correlation, which would be much more important for

second-row than for ﬁrst-row atoms as both the core-valence gap is smaller and there are

more subvalence electrons.

In all, we can say that W3 theory ought to reliable to 0.01 eV or better.

13

B. Electron aﬃnities

Electron aﬃnities are notoriously sensitive to the level of theory (e.g.[55]), both in terms

of the basis set (as the spatial extent of the wave function diﬀers greatly between the anion

and the parent neutral species) and of the electron correlation method (as eﬀectively the

number of particles is increased). It is in particular well known that calculating EAs requires

the addition of diﬀuse functions to the basis set[23, 56]. Therefore, unmodiﬁed W3 theory

would fare rather poorly, and we have instead used (diﬀuse function) augmented basis sets

in the T4 and higher-order T3 corrections. (Regular basis sets were still used on hydrogen.)

Sticklers for acronyms might prefer to call this approach ”W3+ theory”.

Not surprisingly (Table IX), W3 theory is seen to represent a signiﬁcant improvement over

W2 theory for this property. W3 results are almost across the board within the experimental

error bar. In fact, our calculations suggest that W3 theory ought to be competitive with all

but the most precise experimental techniques.

C. Molecular total atomization energies

For molecular atomization energies (Table X), the most spectacular improvement is seen

for the ozone molecule. (Both an accurate re-measurement of the heat of formation[57] and

an accurate set of anharmonic spectroscopic constants[58] have been published very recently.

As connected quadruple excitations contribute very signiﬁcantly to the spectroscopic con-

stants of ozone[59], computing an accurate anharmonic zero-point energy in a large basis set

is an arduous task on which we preferred not to embark for this paper.) Ozone was omitted

from the original W2-1 dataset because of its intrinsic multireference character: an error of

3 kcal/mol by a method (W2) that essentially estimates the CCSD(T) limit is not surprising

for a molecule well outside the ’safety envelope’ of CCSD(T). W3 theory, in contrast, puts

in a quite respectable performance, with an error of only 0.38 kcal/mol.

Very satisfying improvements are likewise seen for two other molecules (N2O and NO2)

with moderate and strong nondynamical correlation eﬀects, respectively. The W2 errors of

1.20 and 1.16 kcal/mol[6] are reduced to 0.51 and 0.09 kcal/mol, respectively.

For some diatomic molecules with precisely known experimental atomization energies

and signiﬁcant static correlation, such as F2, O2, NO, and N2, W2 exhibits errors in the 0.5

kcal/mol range, while W3 reproduces their dissociation energies basically spot-on. A similar

improvement is seen for the HNO molecule.

In well-behaved systems where W2 performed very well (HF, H2O), so does W3. It thus

satisﬁes the ’above all, do no harm’ requirement. The mean absolute errors approach the

average uncertainty for the experimental data, 0.15 kcal/mol.

Peculiarly, the most signiﬁcant errors left now are with sulfur systems, particularly SO2

and H2S.

Does W3A represent an improvement? Clearly the errors for systems with highly polar

bonds are noticeably reduced, and overall error statistics come down somewhat. Almost as

important, the mean signed error is reduced to near zero. However, the somewhat marginal

reduction in the overall error statistics does not appear to justify the substantially increased

computational cost (factor of about 4–5, dominated by the T4 step). More fundamentally,

the increase in the number of CCSDTQ amplitudes by about the same factor may easily

make the diﬀerence between a calculation that is just feasible with available hardware and

one that is not. For systems with strongly polar bonds, W3A, if practically feasible, may

serve as an additional check on a W3 prediction.

The added cost of W3K over W3, by contrast, is nil in open-shell cases and quite modest in

closed-shell cases[60]. Table X reveals that W3K represents a marginal overall improvement

over standard W3. However, its performance for second-row systems is markedly superior,

and in this sense it is arguably a more ‘balanced’ method than standard W3. For ﬁrst-row

systems, reduced deviations for systems dominated by dynamical correlation are oﬀset by

increased deviations for systems with multireference character. The choice between W3 and

W3K can be argued either way, and we have simply left the choice open to the user.

VI. PERFORMANCE OF W4A AND W4B THEORY. OUTLOOK FOR FUR-

THER IMPROVEMENTS.

Some of the systems were small enough that we could compute W4a and W4b total atom-

ization energies. A comparison is given in Table XI. First of all, W4a (with its scaling-based

T4 correction) is clearly superior to W4b (with its extrapolation-based T4 correction). The

extrapolation misbehaves in O and F molecules, as the T4 correction appears to go through

a minimum as a function of the basis set for PVTZ. Secondly, despite the formidable added

15

computational cost, overall performance of W4a only represents a marginal improvement

over W3.

suggest themselves:

This begs the question as to what is still missing in W4a and W4b theory. Three factors

(a) T5 eﬀects (vide supra). These will primarily aﬀect systems with strong nondynamical

correlation eﬀects, and at least some of the systems where W4a and W4b ‘cannot make the

grade’ are essentially devoid of these.

(b) nonadiabatic eﬀects. Literature values for DBOC (diagonal Born-Oppenheimer Correc-

tions) are available for some hydrogen-containing systems[61]: SH 0.2 cm−1, i.e. essentially

nil for our purposes; CH2(3B1) +0.05 kcal/mol; CH radical -0.05 kcal/mol; OH radical -0.01

kcal/mol; H2O +0.10 kcal/mol; HF -0.04 kcal/mol. For the all-heavy atom systems we can

safely consider the DBOC to be negligible on the scale of interest to us. Taking DBOCs into

account may thus somewhat improve results for some hydrides.

(c) post-CCSD(T) eﬀects in the core-valence correlation contribution. Explicit calculation

of such eﬀects is an arduous task, but all-electron CCSDT calculations on N2 and B2 suggest

contributions on the order of 0.05–0.10 kcal/mol. (For B2, we additionally found a T4 core-

valence contribution to the dissociation energy of 0.04 kcal/mol.) For second-row molecules,

with smaller core-valence gaps and more subvalence electrons, this contribution is liable to

be more important: this is consistent with our general observation that W3, W4a, and W4b

theory all perform signiﬁcantly better for ﬁrst-row than for second-row systems.

(d) higher-order relativistic eﬀects. Second-order spin-order coupling was found[32] to con-

tribute 2 kcal/mol to the binding energy of I2 and 0.4 kcal/mol to that of Br2; it cannot be

ruled out that the contribution for Cl2 would reach 0.1 kcal/mol. Recently, the Lamb shift

was found[62] to contribute +0.04 and +0.07 kcal/mol, respectively, to the binding energy

of BF3 and AlF3.

(e) ﬁnally, although the total energy depends fairly weakly on geometric displacements

near the equilibrium geometry, the small discrepancies between CCSD(T)/cc-pV(Q+d)Z

and exact bottom-of-the-well reference geometries may cause small errors. This, however,

clearly cannot explain the issues we are having with atomic IPs and EAs.

VII. CONCLUSIONS

We have developed and validated a new computational thermochemistry protocol termed

W3 theory. Compared to the older W2 theory[4], the main improvements are an improved

treatment of scalar relativistic eﬀects, and particularly an approximate account for post-

CCSD(T) correlation eﬀects. The new method is appreciably more costly, but considerably

more robust, than W2 theory, and in particular yields reliable results for systems suﬀering

from signiﬁcant nondynamical correlation eﬀects. It conﬁrms the earlier assertion[6] that

the accuracy of W2 theory is basically limited by that of the CCSD(T) method.

Iterative T3 eﬀects exhibit a basis set convergence behavior similar to the T3 contribution

overall. They almost universally decrease molecular binding energies. Included by them-

selves, they yield less accurate results than CCSD(T) almost across the board:

it is only

when T4 eﬀects are included that superior performance is achieved. T4 eﬀects systematically

increase molecular binding energies. Their basis set convergence is quite rapid, and even

CCSDTQ/cc-pVDZ scaled by 1.2532 will yield a quite passable quadruples contribution.

The eﬀect of still higher-order excitations was gauged for a subset of molecules (notably the

eight-valence electron systems): T5 contributions reach 0.3 kcal/mol for the pathologically

multireference X 1Σ+

g state of C2 but are quite small for other systems.

Over a sample of 30 molecules — including some with severe nondynamical correlation

eﬀects — going from W2 to W3 reduces mean absolute error in total atomization energies

from 0.395 to 0.220 kcal/mol, RMS error from 0.696 to 0.280 kcal/mol, and the two largest

individual errors from {+3.0 (O3), +1.2 (N2O, NO2)} kcal/mol to {-0.78 (SO2), +0.51

kcal/mol (N2O)}.

Various avenues for further enhancing the accuracy of W3 theory were explored, including

more extensive basis sets, BSSE corrections, larger-basis set corrections for T4 and higher-

order T3 eﬀects, and extrapolation of the inner-shell correlation eﬀects to the basis set limit.

Only marginal improvements can be achieved by these costly measures: W3 appears to

be ‘scratching the bottom out of the barrel’. BSSE on molecular binding energies is still

signiﬁcant even with basis sets as large as the AV6Z combination, but is almost entirely

removed by the extrapolation. We speculate that the main obstacle to breaking the 0.1

kcal/mol barrier would be CCSD(T) imperfections in the core-valence correlation energy;

their explicit computation is presently impractical for all but the very smallest systems.

17

Lesser potential error sources include, but are not limited to, post-CCSDTQ valence corre-

lation eﬀects, corrections to the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, higher-order relativistic

eﬀects (second-order spin-orbit coupling, Lamb shift,...) and imperfections in the reference

geometry.

[60] The easiest way to break down the CCSD correlation energyin singlet and triplet pair com-

ponents using an unmodiﬁed copy of MOLPRO, in a closed-shell case, is to forcibly run the

CCSD part as open-shell since the closed-shell CCSD code does not generate pair correla-

tion energies. CPU time requirements will approximately double for the aﬀected parts of the

calculation. The program will report Eαα, Eββ, and Eαβ, from which ES = Eαβ − Eββ and

ET = Eαα + 2Eββ reproduces Klopper’s partitioning[37].

The hydroxide anion plays an essential role in many chemical and biochemical reactions. But
questions of its hydration state and transport in water are currently controversial. Here we address
this situation using the quasi-chemical theory of solutions. The simplest such approach suggests that

INTRODUCTION

A pre-eminent challenge in liquid state physics is the
understanding of aqueous systems and aqueous-phase re-
actions. Water undergoes limited autoprotolysis, which
is enhanced in the presence of highly charged metals such
as Be2+. Beryllium induced autoprotolysis has conse-
quences for the speciation of this metal (in water [1]),
with implications for environmental clean-up strategies,
and in understanding how inhaled beryllium dust leads
to chronic beryllium disease [2]. Foundational to these
issues is to ﬁrst understand HO−(aq) which serves as a
cross-linker in multinuclear beryllium clusters.

The anomolous diﬀusion of the H+(aq) and HO−(aq)
has received extensive scrutiny over the years (for exam-
ple, [3, 4]). These studies all contained nuggets of insight
that remain to this day. Recently, ab initio molecular
dynamics (AIMD) has provided new information on the
solution condition and transport of these species. Over
a similar period of time, the statistical mechanical the-
ory of liquids (especially water) has also become use-
[5, 6]). These
fully more sophisticated (for example,
two approaches can be complementary, but in typical
practice they remain unfortunately disconnected (but see
[7, 8, 9, 10]).

In an initial AIMD study [11, 12], HO−(aq) was ob-
served to be tetra-hydrated during the course of the ∼6 ps
long simulation. This complex had a lifetime of about

2-3 ps. The structure of this complex (HO · [H2O]4

converted to a tri-hydrated (HO · [H2O]3
which the ligating water molecules are arranged roughly
as three corners of a tetrahedron centered on the anion
oxygen, similar to the hydrogen bonding arrangements
in water.

A more recent study [13] reinforces the notion of
− species. The proposed mecha-
a stable HO · [H2O]4
nism for HO−(aq) transport is: ﬁrst the stable (and
− converts to the “active”
hence “inactive”) HO · [H2O]4
− species; then the H-bond between the an-
HO · [H2O]3
ion and one of the ligating water molecules shortens,
thus identifying a transient HO · [H2O]− species; a shared
proton is transferred along that shortened bond, and a
− species is reconstituted with the hydroxide

identity now switched; this “active” HO · [H2O]3
− moiety com-
reverts back to an “inactive” HO · [H2O]4
pleting one transport event. Statistical characterization
has been sketchy. Presumably, as in [12], the lifetime of
− species could be about 2-3 ps, so that
the HO · [H2O]4
in about 60 ps of simulation [13], 20-30 transport events
might be anticipated.

Discussions of a transport mechanism for HO−(aq)
typically focus on Agmon’s[14, 15] extraction of an ac-
tivation energy for hydroxide transport from the temper-
ature dependence of the experimental mobilities. Near
room temperature that empirical parameter is about
3 kcal/mol but increases by roughly a factor of two for
slightly lower temperatures. As a mechanical barrier this
value, about 5-6 kbT, may be low enough to require some
subtlety of interpretation[16]; the observed temperature
sensitivity supports that possibility. But Tuckerman et
al.
[13] estimate the barrier height for their proposed
mechanism as follows: (A) Novoa et al. [17] in a gas-phase
calculation ﬁnd a barrier height of 1.16 kcal/mol for the
−, the ﬁrst
conversion of HO · [H2O]4
shell hydrating water moves to the second shell; [Note
that, in order to be interpreted as a free energy for that
comparison in liquid water, this value must be density de-
pendent to reﬂect the fugacity of water molecule ligands.]
(B) Agmon [15] estimates a value of 0.5 kcal/mol for
shortening of one (1) H-bond pair which they multiply by
three (3) for the three H-bonds to HO− in HO · [H2O]3
−;
(C) then they combine this with 0.34 kcal/mol, a path

− to HO · [H2O]3

integral estimate (involving the entire simulation sys-
tem) for the activation energy for proton transfer be-
tween the two tri-hydrated species transiently involving
HO · [H2O]−. The combined estimate of 3 kcal/mol was
noted to be consistent with the value quoted by Agmon
for his quite diﬀerent mechanism for HO− transport. In
− —
his model, the water molecule hydrating HO · [H2O]3
the second shell water — ﬁrst dissociates, costing about
2.6 kcal/mol. Then one (1) of the O-O bond shortens,
which he estimates to cost 0.5 kcal/mol, and a proton
transfer occurs. Agmon thus gets a combined estimate
of 3.1 kcal/mol.

These target activation energy estimates were based
on bulk property measurements [14] and these empirical
activation energies derived from Arrhenius plots include
solvent inﬂuence. Additionally, the earlier gas-phase
− is more stable
studies have shown that (a) HO · [H2O]3
−, and (b) the barrier for HO · [H2O]3

than HO · [H2O]4
− is 2.5 kcal/mol, nearly 1.3 kcal/mol
to HO · [H2O]4
greater than the barrier for the reverse process. This
is only 0.5 kcal/mol oﬀ the 3 kcal/mol estimate in [13].
The apparent inconsistencies of these various results
were noted recently [18]. Those AIMD studies treated
deuterated NaOD and KOD hydroxide solutions with
concentrations ranging between 1.5 M to 15 M [18, 19].

this distribution was inﬂuenced by the counterion. Yet

[13] was strengthened.

The observed inﬂuence of the cations in those more
recent calculations[18] means that solution condition of
a solitary HO−(aq) is not settled and the original spec-
ulations therefore not resolved. We use two distinct ap-
proaches to address these issues. Both our statistical
mechanical quasi-chemical theory of solutions and pre-
−
liminary AIMD simulations suggest that HO · [H2O]3
is the stable species. The simulations suggest that trans-
port of the hydroxide is similar to the transport of a
proton hole. We suggest how the apparent high “eﬀec-
tive” solvation number of HO− can be resolved without
invoking HO · [H2O]4

II. QUASI-CHEMICAL THEORY

In the quasi-chemical theory [6], the region around the
solute of interest is partitioned into inner and outer shell
domains. Typically the inner shell, where chemical ef-
fects could be important, is treated quantum mechani-
cally. The outer shell contributions can be assessed us-
ing classical force-ﬁelds or dielectric continuum models.
(The theory permits a variational check of this parti-
tion.) In the present study outer shell contributions have
been evaluated with a dielectric continuum model and
the trends conﬁrmed by molecular dynamics calculations
using classical interatomic potentials.

The inner shell reactions are:

HO− + nH2O ⇀↽ HO[H2O]n

[20].

The free energy change for these reactions were cal-
culated using the Gaussian programs
The
− (n = 0. . .4) clusters were geometry opti-
HO · [H2O]n
mized in the gas phase using the B3LYP hybrid density
functional[21] and the 6-31+G(d,p) basis set. Frequency
calculations conﬁrmed a true minimum, and the zero
point energies were computed at the same level of the-
ory. Single point energies were calculated using both the
6-311+G(2d,p) and the aug-cc-pVTZ basis sets. For esti-
mating the outer shell contribution, the ChelpG method
[22] was used to obtain partial atomic charges. Then
with the radii set developed by Stefanovich et al.[23], sur-
face tessera were generated [24], and the solvation free
energies of the clusters were calculated using a dielec-
tric continuum model [25]. With this information and
the binding free energies for the chemical reactions, the
quasi-chemical approximation to the excess chemical po-
tential of HO−(aq) in water can be written as:

requires binding constants in solution phase, a primi-
tive ﬁrst approximation is to use these gas phase quanti-
ties.) The density factor ρH2O appearing in eq. 1 reﬂects
the actual density of liquid water and its eﬀect is ac-
counted for by including a replacement contribution of
−nkbT ln(1354). It is this replacement contribution re-
ﬂecting the availability of water molecule ligands that was
noted earlier as missing from the conventional electronic
energy diﬀerences discussed above. A detailed statement
on standard states and this replacement contribution can
be found in Grabowski et al. [10].

Figure 1 gives the solvation free energy of the hydrox-
ide anion for various hydration states. The excess free
energies were calculated assuming only one particular n
in eq. 1 to better highlight µex vs. n dependency. It is
clear, however, that based on the exponential weight-
ing in Kn that including n = 1, 2, 3 would be indis-
tinguishable from using just n = 3. Clearly including
n = 4 will make no diﬀerence. In order of decreasing sta-

The energetics for the gas-phase hydration reactions,
and the cluster structures, are in reasonable agreement
with results in [27], with diﬀerences attributable to diﬀer-
ences in the basis sets for optimization and energy eval-
uations.

III. AB INITIO MOLECULAR DYNAMICS

The AIMD simulations were carried out with the
VASP [28, 29] simulation program using the generalized
gradient approximation [30, 31] to the electron density
functional theory. Ultrasoft pseudopotentials [32, 33] for
oxygen were used to describe the core-valence interaction,
and the valence orbitals were expanded in plane waves
with a kinetic energy cutoﬀ of 29.1 Ry. The system com-
prises a hydroxide anion in a box of 32 water molecules.
The box size was set to 9.8788 ˚A consistent with the ex-
perimental partial speciﬁc volume of the HO−(aq) [34].
This system was initially thermalized by about 10 ps of
classical molecular dynamics simulation with a temper-
ature of 300 K using velocity scaling. All our AIMD

∼10 ps classical MD (n = 5), followed by ∼1.5 ps of 300 K
velocity scaling AIMD (n = 4), and followed by the above
NVE ensemble simulations. At ∼3.2 ps, random velocities
assigned at 300 K and the NVE run continued. For time ≤
3.2 ps, the total energy was -478.78±0.06 (2σ) eV, and for
time ≥ 3.2 ps, the total energy was -478.99±0.06 (2σ) eV.

⋆

simulations were performed with 1 fs timestep, which is
fairly conservative. This choice is validated by the good
energy conservation during the NVE simulations ﬁg. 2.

In the earlier Car-Parrinello (CP)-AIMD approach
[11, 12, 13, 18, 19], the wave function optimization was
sought using classical dynamics in which the electrons
are assigned a ﬁctitious mass. A recent study [35] of CP-
AIMD suggested “ . . . the necessity for checking the de-
pendence of results of CP simulations on the value of the
ﬁctitious mass parameter” because they found a constant
bias, in proportion to the ﬁctitious electron mass, be-
tween the force based on the Born-Oppenheimer surface
(the Hellmann-Feynman force on the nuclei) and the CP-
Lagrangian derived force. Bear in mind, however, that in
our AIMD simulations the wave functions are converged
for each nuclear position by conjugate gradient methods;
so if the wave function converges at all, it will converge
to the BO-surface. For all but the ﬁrst step, this conver-
gence is achieved in 4 SCF cycles, and in 5-6 cycles for
proton-sharing situations between two HO− groups, but
never more.

Fig. 2 shows that starting from about 1.5 ps of velocity
scaling AIMD simulation and removing the thermostat

−6 kcal/mol suggested by the primitive quasi-chemical
approach, but the ordering is correct. Also clearly n = 2
is predicted to be signiﬁcantly less stable in contrast to
the quasi-chemical prediction. A source of concern in the
analysis in ﬁg. 3 is the lack of suﬃcient statistics, a prob-
lem that vexes AIMD simulations. Further, for n = 4 say,
a range of structures will be represented in the AIMD
simulation, but only the most stable structure is used in
the primitive quasi-chemical approximation. It is possi-
ble to include these other structures but obtaining these
structures in the gas-phase is daunting. The x2 statistic
is artifactual as will be discussed below. Note that quasi-
chemical theory can be formulated in terms of these xn
distributions, but practical applications decidedly suﬀer
from limited statistics in AIMD simulations [9].

IV. CONCLUDING DISCUSSIONS

Two distinct lines of theoretical investigation converge
− species is the more
to a common view: the HO · [H2O]3
stable form. The transport mechanism simply involves
the movement of the hole between two tri-hydrated cen-
ters as idealized in ﬁg. 4. There certainly are second-shell
rearrangements, but not the large scale breaking and re-
forming of hydrogen bonds suggested by Agmon[15]. It
appears that simple distortions of H-bonds are what are
occuring on the timescales of the hole movement. Once
the hole settles into its new place there will certainly be
rearrangements.

The hole-hopping proposal, as discussed by Bernal and
Fowler [3] and H¨uckel [3], as mediating HO− transport
thus appears to be essentially correct. Such hole-hopping
was also considered by Stillinger[5] in his statistical me-
chanical development of proton transfer processes. Criti-
cally, no rate limiting changes in the inner shell hydration
structure of the HO−(aq) mediating transport is noted.
An interesting result from the simulations is the aver-
age O-O distance between the anionic oxygen and the
nearest neighboring oxygen atom: 2.45±0.1(2σ) ˚A in
ﬁg. 2. This distance is surprisingly close to O-O separa-
tion in the gas-phase structure of HO · [H2O]−. This then
suggests that HO · [H2O]− is a prominent sub-grouping
− (n = 3, 4) species. This is the reason
in the HO · [H2O]n
why x1 cannot be unambiguously obtained and underlies
the artifact in x2 noted in discussing ﬁg. 3. Evidently,
this grouping mediates the hole transport as sketched in
ﬁg. 4.

The presence of the HO · [H2O]− sub-grouping could

resolve the high “eﬀective” (not microscopic) hydration
numbers extracted from dielectric dispersion measure-
ments [36]. A ‘super’-grouping of HO · [H2O]−, one in-
volving four (4) or more water molecules rather than
HO− alone, could well be relevent to the time scale of
the measurement. This possibility was also suggested by
− [13, 18, 19] is not a con-
Agmon[15]. Then HO · [H2O]4
sequence necessary to the resolution of experimentally
obtained “eﬀective” hydration numbers.

Experimentalists have explained the spectroscopic fea-
tures in concentrated (≥10 M) alkaline solutions by in-
voking the HO · [H2O]− grouping [37, 38, 39, 40]. It re-
mains to be seen if this holds true at more modest con-
centrations (≤ 2 M). The simulations here also show that
the hydrogen of HO− is not hydrogen bonded for most
of the simulation. Spectroscopists infer the existence of
this “free” OH stretch based on the spike in the Raman
spectrum at ∼3600 cm−1. It is attractive to speculate

5

that the phonon-proton coupling [39] that is thought to
lead to the characteristic IR-spectra also holds the key to
understanding the hole transport rate (a similar situation
holds for excess protons), but fundamentally it appears
that there is no need to postulate new mechanisms for
HO− transport.

Abstract

The estimation of the surface tension of water is theoretically dealt on the basis of
the dipole molecular model. It is known that the experimentally determined surface
tension of freshly exposed surface has a higher value than the nominal value of
73 [mN/m]. We calculated the value corresponding to the fresh surface where the
reorientation of the molecules has not occurred.

Key words: surface energy, surface tension, orientation, dipole moment
PACS: 68.37.-d

1 Introduction

The surface tension of water, γ = 73[mN/m], is considered to be a static
value after the equilibrium of the rearrangement of the molecules at surface is
attained. The structure of surface orientation [1] of water molecules is not yet
well-deﬁned, though the simulations using molecular dynamics [2] have been
studied. This may be one reason that the theoretical calculation of surface
tension of water which explains the static value has not yet been reported.
Theoretical treatments of the surface tension have been done for nonpolar van
der Waals molecules by statistical mechanics, or by using intermolecular forces
involving Hamaker constant on the basis of the Lifshitz theory[3],[4].

These results showed considerably good agreement with experimental values
of nonpolar materials. However, theoretical calculation for the polar molecules
seems to be hampered by the diﬃculty of evaluation of surface orientation.
On the other hand, the surface tension of water is known to have higher
value than the static one for freshly created surface. This has been shown
by the dynamical measurement by the oscillating jet method [5], where a
value of 180[mN/m] is observed immediately after the surface is created, and
gradually lowers to its static value within less than 10[mS] [6]. The higher
value is thought to originate from the freshly exposed water surface where the
molecules are not completely reoriented. We here focused on the calculation of
the unoriented surface tension of water based on the dipole interaction model.
The calculation of the contribution of additional terms of intermolecular forces
are also presented.

The surface energy which is deﬁned as the (positive) energy per area of the
surface, is equivalent to the energy for creation of the surface. The surface
energy originates from the binding energy between molecules. One molecule
inside bulk is surrounded by other molecules. Let us deﬁne the number of such
molecules (number of nearest neighbour) as Ni, and the mean binding energy
W between nearest two molecules. Then the binding energy per one molecule
is

Note that W < 0. On the other hand, the molecule on the surface is surrounded
by less neighbours Ns. Then the binding energy per molecule is

Therefore the molecule on surface has larger energy than that inside bulk.

In the above discussion we considered only the nearest neighbour interaction.
However, we must consider the long range force like Van der Waals and dipole-

dipole interactions. For this purpose, our method for calculating the surface
energy is as follows.

(1) Consider the virtual ﬂat surface in bulk which divide bulk into two pieces.
(2) Calculate the binding energy between two molecules.
(3) Sum up the binding energies for all molecule-pairs across the virtual sur-

face in bulk.

(4) The binding energy obtained above divided by two times surface area

gives the surface energy per area.

We will calculate the surface energy of water by the above procedure in the
following sections. The surface tension γ which we observe is diﬀerent from
the surface energy by entropy term.

γ = u

T s,

−

where u is the surface energy (per area), and s is the entropy density per area.
However, the entropy term is not in consideration here, and we assume it
smaller than the surface energy u. In this sense the surface tension is approx-
imated by surface energy and we compare the experimental value of surface
tension of water to the surface energy which we calculate.

Before starting our program, let us consider the dimensional analysis. The
molecule of water has its own dipole moment.[7]

The molecular density is

µ = 6.471

n = 3.35

By using these two quantities: µ and n, we can have only one quantity which
has dimension of energy density.

By using the coordinates θA, θB, φA, φB represented in the Fig.1,
This energy can be written in the form.

V =

2 cos θA cos θB].

(6)

Note that the energy depends not only on the angle between
two dipole’s orientations but also on the direction and length
between these two dipoles. Therefore the thermal expectation
value of such an energy becomes complicated.

Fig. 1

To obtain the partition function, we further determine the integration measure.
As two angles (θ, φ) specify a point onS2, integration measure can be taken
to be the surface area covering S2 ×

Next we will explain how we can obtain surface energy from this function. Our
purpose is to obtain the interaction energy between molecules that are placed
across the virtual surface. Let us denote U and U ′ as molecules above that
surface, and denote D and D′ as molecules under the surface. This is shown
in Fig.2. Then we need to obtain the thermal expectation value of binding
energy between two bulks divided by the virtual surface.

where, dµU is the integration measure on the orientation of dipole moment
of molecule U. VU U ′
is the interaction energy between dipole moments of
molecules U and U ′. Other notations can be understood in the same way. We
calculate the expectation value of the interaction energy between two dipoles,

one is in U and another one is in D. Then we use the mean ﬁeld approxima-
tion by rewriting unremarked other dipole moments to their mean values. Since
there is no speciﬁc direction and we know that the water has no spontaneous
electric polarisation, we take these values to be zero. This is an important as-

sumption.

Then we have

In a meanwhile we utilise Eq. [9] only for surface molecules like in Fig.3, and
we calculate the surface energy in nearest neighbour approximation. Then the
surface energy Usur is given by nearest neighbour interaction < VAB > as,

where the negative sign is to make the surface energy to be positive. N is the

Fig.4 Usur −
From this result, it seems good agreement with static value of surface tension.
But here we have neglected the eﬀect of surface orientation and other inter-
actions beyond the nearest neighbour approximation. On the other hand, it
is reported that, in experiments using oscillating jet method [5] , the value

α

9

of surface tension is about 180[mJ/m2] just after the creation of new surface
[6]. Its value relaxes to the static value 73[mJ/m2] within less than 10[mS].
This phenomenon is usually explained by the surface orientation. The water
molecules on the surface rotate and to make its surface free energy (surface
tension) minimum during this period. Since we can not take into account the
surface orientation from technical reason, we need to improve the approxima-
tion beyond the nearest-neighbour’s one and to obtain the value 180[mJ/m2]
as the surface tension. This is discussed in the next section.

4 Beyond the Nearest-Neighbour Approximation

As we have seen in the previous section, the form of binding energy is com-
plicated even for one molecule-pair interaction, and it seems quite diﬃcult
to consider the theory beyond the nearest neighbour interactions. Further-
more, since the potential energy between two dipoles has the form of 1/r3,
the sum of the potential energy will diverge logarithmically. Therefore we give
an important hypothesis: we utilise thermal expectation value of dipole-dipole
interaction energy as an elementary potential energy, and to sum up these
energies for all the molecule pairs across the surface (See Fig.6).
From this hypothesis, the potential depends on neither orientations of dipoles,
nor relative direction of dipole pair, i.e., it depends only on the distance of
dipole pair. The function of potential starts from 1/r6, and so we have no
divergence in summing up.

From the previous calculation, we see that the partition function of dipole-
dipole interaction can be expressed by even function of α. This means the ex-
∂lnZ/∂β has the distance
pectation value of interaction energy: < V (r) >=
dependence in the series of 1/r6m(m = 1, 2, 3, . . . ), since α = const.

Second as in Fig.6, we sum up the energy U(L) by changing the position
of molecule A in opposite bulk. This summation is also calculated by using
continuous approximation, i.e. by integration. The distance of two bulks ǫ is
an order of d, and its value is quite critical to the result. So we discuss its
value later. Then we have the “bulk to bulk” surface energy.

(46)

For ǫ = d, this surface energy is smaller than the one in the case of nearest
neighbour approximation, though it should be larger. (compare Eq. [44] with
3.) The reason is the following. Since we have ap-
Eq. [46] by noting n = d−
proximated all the molecules are continuously spread out, the bulk to bulk
distance has increased eﬀectively. This is shown in Fig.7. Each molecule is
spread out continuously in V1 and V2 as shown in (b). For ǫ = d, the mean
distance between two molecules is larger than d. To determine the virtual
bulk-bulk distance ǫ, our consideration follows.

11

Fig.7

We require that the potential 1/d6m as in Fig.7 (a) coincides with the mean
potential < 1/r6m > as in Fig.7 (b), where each molecule is spread out uni-
formly in column V1 and V2 with hight d and basal area d2. Then we can
determine ǫ for each number of m.

(47)

Though it might seem strange that ǫ depends on m, the bulk distance ǫ is vir-
tual mathematical object, and it improves the errors coming from continuous
approximation at short distance. Therefore it can be varied by the parame-
ter of potential form m. Hereafter we rewrite ǫ

appendix 2, in large m limit this condition reduces to

If we compare Eq. [44] with Eq. [46] by using above relation, we see the
coincidence of the series expansion of U BB and U N N at large m. This is not
surprising. For large m, the short range interaction enhanced, and the nearest
neighbour interaction plays a central role in surface energy.

For m = 1, 2 we obtain in appendix 2,

ǫ1 = 0.373d,

ǫ2 = 0.54639d.

the interaction energies for all the molecule-pairs across the virtual surface.

The Fig.8 shows the α dependence of the surface energy.

Our theory gives the surface energy 185[mJ/m2] at normal temperature (300K).
This result well coincides with the experimental value 180[mJ/m2] by using
the oscillating jet method [5], [6]. However, we need to take into account other
interactions. This is done in next section.

5 Additional Other Forces

We still have 3 kind of forces which work between molecules such as, dispersion
force, induced force, and repulsive force (part of Lennard-Jones potential). So
we must include them into our consideration of surface energy.

The dispersion force is essentially quantum mechanical eﬀect.[4]

These values are given as α0/(4πǫ0) = 1.48

The induced force is the interaction between static molecular dipole and the
instantaneous dipole moment due to the ﬂuctuation of electron cloud.[4]

From above calculations, the total surface energy at normal temperature is

Usur = U dipole + U disp + U ind + U rep = 185 + 25 = 210.

(58)

Comparing to the experimental value of surface tension: 180[mJ/m2], the
obtained value is only 17 % larger. [6] So we may conclude that our method
to obtain the surface tension expresses the nature of water.

6 Summary

We have calculated the dipole-dipole interaction energy to higher order by
using statistical mechanics. Then we sum up the energies for all the molecule
pairs across the surface in bulk. In this way we have calculated the surface
energy of water as dipoler liquid. Our treatment is the ﬁrst step for obtaining
the surface energy, though some improvements may be necessary. The ﬁrst
improvement should be done for the rough mean ﬁeld approximation. The
thermal expectation value < VU D > may be aﬀected by other environmental
molecules. This might be done by introducing the eﬀect of dielectric constant
like the Lifschitz theory.

Since we have a translational invariance to the inter facial direction, when we
integrate by ~r1 in column V1, we ﬁx ~r2 in the centre axis in column V2. After
that, the integration of ~r2 is given only in the centre axis direction such as,
integrating from 0 to d and divided by d, and to obtain the mean value.

If we compare Eq. [44] with Eq. [46] using above relation, we see the coin-
cidence of the series expansion of U BB and U N N at large m. This is quite
natural result. Because at large m, only the short range interaction enhanced,
and so the nearest neighbour interaction gives the main eﬀect.

use U N N instead of U BB for m

We show that two-dimensional convection-diﬀusion problems with a radial sink or source at the
origin may be recast as a pure diﬀusion problem in a ﬁctitious space in which the spatial dimension is
continuously-tunable with the P´eclet number. This formulation allows us to probe various diﬀusion-
controlled processes in non-integer dimensions.

Consider a system of non-interacting passive particles
that undergo a combination of diﬀusion and convection
that is driven by a steady velocity ﬁeld v

Suppose that the velocity ﬁeld is inversely proportional
to the radial distance, v = Q
2πr . Such a divergenceless
ﬁeld is natural in two dimensions and is generated by a
point sink (or source) of strength Q in an incompressible
ﬂuid. This ﬂow ﬁeld has the remarkable property that
the convection term can be absorbed into the diﬀusion
operator by an appropriate shift of the spatial dimension.
Indeed, the density satisﬁes

We can thus interpret convection-diﬀusion in two di-
1 as isotropic dif-
mensions with a radial velocity v
fusion in a space with variable eﬀective dimension. The
motivation for developing this connection is that there
are many problems in many-body physics for which the
spatial dimension is an important determining factor in
the phenomenology. In diﬀusion-controlled reactions, for
example, a large body of work has uncovered the gen-
eral feature that when the spatial dimension d exceeds a
critical value dc (that depends on the speciﬁcs of the re-
action), the reaction kinetics has a mean-ﬁeld character,

a situation where any pair of reactants is equally likely
to react. Conversely, when the spatial dimension d < dc,
ﬂuctuation-dominated phenomena arise, such as anoma-
lously slow kinetics and non-trivial spatial organization
of reactants, see, e.g., Refs. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] for a review.
The radial ﬂow system oﬀers a potentially attractive way
to study the full range of behavior between the disparate
mean-ﬁeld and ﬂuctuation-controlled regimes simply by
tuning the ﬂow velocity.

In this work, we therefore exploit the connection be-
tween convection-diﬀusion in two dimensions and pure
diﬀusion in a space with a tunable eﬀective dimension.
By this equivalence we can probe diﬀusion-controlled pro-
cesses in arbitrary dimension by varying the P´eclet num-
ber.
In the next section we emphasize some subtleties
associated with this mapping. In the following sections,
we study simple diﬀusion-controlled reactions in general
dimensions by exploiting the mapping to radial ﬂow in
two dimensions. We ﬁrst consider the inﬂuence of an ab-
sorbing trap on the concentration proﬁle in Sect. III. In
particular, we analyze the minimal separation between
the particles and the trap. In Sect. IV we consider two
simple reactive systems, namely, irreversible coalescence
and irreversible annihilation.

II. SPREADING OF A RING

As a warm-up exercise, we ﬁrst consider the spread of
an initial density proﬁle that is concentrated on a ring of
radius R,

c(r, t = 0) =

1
2πR

δ(r

R).

−

(5)

This example illuminates some pitfalls of the mapping
convection-diﬀusion in two dimensions onto a pure dif-
fusion problem and shows that the size of the ring is
asymptotically relevant only for sink ﬂows.

It is possible to ﬁnd the spread of the initial ring by
solving the convection-diﬀusion equation in two dimen-
sions subject to the initial condition (5). The solution
can be written in terms of Bessel functions in the Laplace
domain or as an inﬁnite series in the time domain. How-
ever, physical insight about the solution is more easily
obtained from its asymptotic behavior. To determine

2

the asymptotics, we make use of the mapping (3) and
express the original problem as a purely diﬀusive system
and then use the well-known scaling solution of the latter
equation to describe the spread from a point mass at the
origin.

There is a subtlety in specifying the initial condition.
The initial two-dimensional ring distribution (5) is nor-
malized to unit “mass”

M(t = 0) =

c(r, t = 0) 2πr dr = 1 .

In the eﬀective d-dimensional space, however, the mass
Meﬀ is diﬀerent,

b = dphys/2 = 1; that is, the asymptotic solution should
read

Here Ωd = 2πd/2/Γ(d/2) is the surface area of unit sphere
in d dimensions. Asymptotically, the concentration pro-
ﬁle should depend on the total eﬀective mass Meﬀ , while
the initial size R should become irrelevant. Thus one
might anticipate that the density approaches

Interestingly, Eq. (7) is correct only for sink ﬂows. An
inconsistency in the ansatz (7) can immediately be seen
by computing the total mass, M(t) =
c(r, t)2πr dr, in
the physical two-dimensional space. Using (7) we obtain

in the long-time limit. Equation (8) looks reasonable for
sink ﬂows—the sink causes particles to disappear which
is reﬂected by the decay of M(t). On the other hand,
for source ﬂows (λ > 0) equation (8) is invalid—the pre-
diction that the total mass diverges as tλ is clearly non-
sensical.

ar, t

To resolve this puzzle, it is useful to recall the deriva-
tion of Eq. (7) to see why it does not apply to source
ﬂows. The fundamental solution (7) may be found by
noting that the diﬀusion equation is invariant under the
a2t. Hence the scaling vari-
transformation r
able η = r2/4Dt remains invariant under this scale trans-
formation, suggesting that the fundamental solution has
bF (η). Then mass conservation
the form c(r, t) = t−
ddr c(r, t) = M = const. yields b = d/2. Finally, by
d/2F (η) into the diﬀusion equa-
substituting c(r, t) = t−

tion and solving the resulting ordinary diﬀerential equa-
tion we ﬁnd F = e−

η and thus recover Eq. (7).

→

→

For the radial ﬂow problem, however, mass conserva-
tion arises in the physical two-dimensional space, rather
than in the eﬀective d-dimensional space. Therefore,

Thus for source ﬂows, the total mass remains constant,

In this case, the system “forgets” the initial conditions.
Conversely, our hand-waving argument is correct for
sink ﬂows as can be veriﬁed by explicit solution of the
full convection-diﬀusion equation [6]. Therefore the total
mass decays according to Eq. (8) and the density is given
by (7), or equivalently

expressions.

III. DISTANCE TO THE CLOSEST PARTICLE

As an illustration of the utility of the equivalence be-
tween convection-diﬀusion in two dimensions and pure
diﬀusion in general dimensions, we examine here the fol-
lowing question: What is the typical distance from the
boundary of the absorbing trap to the closest particle?
Suppose that the trap is a disc of radius R centered at
the origin, so that particles freely diﬀuse for r > R and
get absorbed at r = R. We assume that initial density is
uniform, c
|t=0 = c0. We anticipate that the typical sep-
aration rmin between the trap and the closest surviving
particle exhibits the following behaviors:

For sink ﬂows, rmin is ﬁnite.

For source ﬂows, rmin diverges with time.

•

•

We now conﬁrm these expectations and establish the pre-
cise asymptotic form of the minimal distance rmin by em-
ploying a simple quasi-static approach [7, 8]. The mini-
mal distance can also be found by more formal methods
[9, 10].

For sink ﬂows, the concentration approaches a time-
(r) that is found by solving the
independent proﬁle c
Laplace equation subject to the absorbing boundary con-
dition, c

In the long-time limit, ηmin →

Let us now illustrate our results by considering some

For source ﬂows, the minimal distance grows with time
because particles are driven away from the origin. In us-
ing the connection to pure diﬀusion in a space of dimen-
sion deﬀ , we note that deﬀ < 2 and therefore we can set
the radius of the trap to zero because a diﬀusing parti-
cle is recurrent and will hit a point trap with certainty
if deﬀ < 2. This equivalent problem has the advantage
of being tractable analytically by elementary means. In-
deed, we look for a scaling solution of the form

c(r, t) = c0F (η),

η =

that also satisﬁes

In this case, the particles are driven away from the trap in
an essentially deterministic manner and the above scaling

The case of pure diﬀusion in two dimensions is most
subtle: the density proﬁle remains time-dependent, but
we cannot seek a solution in a scaling form because the
size of the trap cannot be ignored in two dimensions [6].
The divergence of the minimal distance with time is also
particularly delicate in this case, namely [7, 10],

INTERACTING PARTICLE SYSTEMS
WITH A LOCALIZED SOURCE

Consider now the inﬂuence of radial ﬂow on an in-
teracting particle systems. Particularly simple models
of this type are irreversible annihilation or irreversible
coalescence [11, 12, 13, 14]. Suppose that the system
is initially empty and that a localized particle source of
strength J at the origin is turned on at time t = 0. Par-
ticles are emitted at the origin and are advected by the
radial ﬂow ﬁeld. The particles also diﬀuse and react upon
colliding with each other (we set the particle radii equal
to one). These processes may be described by the rate
equation

We now employ the same line of reasoning as that given
in Refs. [11, 14] to determine the particle density. When
the eﬀective dimension suﬃciently large, d > 4, particles
do not “see” each other; i.e., they interact suﬃciently
weakly that far from the source a non-interacting den-

and that ˙r = v, the maximum distance traveled by par-
ticles grows as √t. Thus the total number of particle

The results for source ﬂow are seemingly peculiar; here
one might naively expect that the total density grows
linearly with time because particles are driven away from

the mapping between radial ﬂow in two dimensions to
pure diﬀusion in variable spatial dimension. Consider,
for simplicity, the case of strong source ﬂow, i.e., the
P´eclet number is large. We may then drop the diﬀusion
terms and keep just the dominant convection term. Using
this simpliﬁcation and assuming that the system is in the
steady-state regime, the governing equation (21) becomes

and coalescence. More generally, we may also consider
irreversible mass-conserving aggregation where the reac-
tion of a cluster of mass i with a cluster of mass j leads

to a cluster of mass k = i + j. For aggregation, the fun-
damental quantities are the densities of various particle
species. Let us set the mass of particles that are emit-
ted at the origin to unity. Denote the density of these
monomer particles as c1. Generally let ck be the density
of particles composed of k monomers. We shall seek only
the stationary densities ck(r). These densities satisfy a

was originally made by Smoluchowski; it greatly simpli-
ﬁes the analysis of the inﬁnite system of rate equations
[17] . Furthermore, for diﬀusion-controlled reactions in
two dimensions, the reaction rate depends on the reac-
tant radii in a weak logarithmic fashion [1, 6].)

V. CONCLUDING REMARKS

Allowing the spatial dimension d to be a free parame-
ter and then developing theoretical approaches based on
this parameter (an expansion about a critical dimension,
dimensional regularization, etc.) has proven extremely
fruitful in ﬁeld theory and statistical physics [18, 19].
Thus in many treatments of critical phenomena, non-
integer dimensions arise naturally, but this construction
is generally used as an intermediate step toward the ulti-
mate goal of obtaining information in physically relevant
spatial dimensions, such as d = 1, 2, 3. However, cer-
tain complex problems can be mapped onto simpler ones
that are deﬁned in spaces of a non-integer spatial di-
mension. We demonstrated that such a connection arises
for a class of two-dimensional convection-diﬀusion prob-
lems in which the ﬂow ﬁeld is radial and proportional
to 1/r. It would be exciting to realize these convection-
diﬀusion ﬂows experimentally and hence probe dynami-
cal processes in spaces whose dimension is not necessarily
an integer.

Path integral virial estimator based on the scaling of ﬂuctuation coordinates:
Application to fourth-order propagators

Takeshi Yamamoto∗
Department of Chemistry, Graduate School of Science, Kyoto University, Kyoto 606-8502, Japan

We ﬁrst show that a simple scaling of ﬂuctuation coordinates in discretized path integral results
in the conventional virial estimators such as centroid virial estimator. In contrast to more custom-
ary approaches based on integration by parts, the above scaling procedure has an advantage that
it allows a numerical diﬀerentiation of the potential action with respect to temperature, which to-
tally eliminates the need of higher-order potential derivatives. We exploit this advantage in order to
calculate energy and heat capacity of a hydrogen cluster at low temperature using fourth-order com-
posite propagators together with the virial and double virial estimators. This calculation formally
requires up to third-order potential derivatives, but in practice only up to ﬁrst-order derivatives
suﬃce by virtue of the scaling procedure above.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Imaginary time path integral is among the most robust and widely used techniques for studying quantum statisti-
cal mechanics of many-particle systems.1,2 In real space formulation called discretized path integral, this method
maps a quantum system into replicas of virtual classical systems connected via harmonic springs. This simple
“isomorphism” allows one to calculate structural and thermodynamic properties using Monte Carlo or molecu-
lar dynamics methods.
In practical applications to systems in condensed phase or at low temperature, how-
ever, such calculation becomes far more demanding than the classical counterpart, and thus a number of tech-
niques have been developed to achieve faster convergence, e.g., more eﬃcient sampling of replicas,2,3,4,5 statisti-
cal estimators with lower variance,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16 and more accurate approximations to the exact short-time
propagator.3,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32

Regarding the calculation of internal energy and heat capacity, there are two major estimators, i.e., thermodynamic6
and virial,7 which have their own merits and demerits. The thermodynamic estimator for energy can be obtained
by direct temperature diﬀerentiation of the quantum partition function. The advantage of this estimator is that it
requires no potential derivatives if the primitive approximation is used, while its well-known deﬁciency is that the
statistical variance grows linearly with the number of replicas.9 The virial estimator avoids this diﬃculty by eliminating
ill-behaved terms in the thermodynamic estimator via integration by parts, and as a result its variance becomes only
weakly dependent on the number of replicas.9 But importantly, this gain is obtained at the expense of introducing
ﬁrst-order potential derivatives. The contrast between these two estimators becomes more remarkable when they
are applied to heat capacity; the variance of the double thermodynamic estimator increases quadratically with the
discretization number, while the corresponding double virial estimator requires second-order potential derivatives.13
(We will not consider other mixed estimators in this paper; see Refs. 13 and 16 for their comparison.) On the other
hand, if one employs fourth-order composite propagators such as the Suzuki factorization,17 all the above estimators
require one higher-order potential derivatives (e.g., third-order derivatives for heat capacity using the double virial
estimator). Thus, an attempt to reduce statistical error or to use a more accurate propagator requires increasingly
higher-order potential derivatives.

To remedy this situation, Glaesemann and Fried12,13 proposed a method for reducing the variance of thermody-
namic estimator through a free-particle projection technique, and obtained a low-variance estimator with no potential
derivatives that performs equally well to the centroid virial estimator under favorable conditions. Predescu et al.15
employed a diﬀerent strategy in their random series path integral (generalized form of the Fourier path integral),
in which they scaled the amplitude of the Brownian bridge such that a viriallike estimator naturally arises upon
temperature diﬀerentiation of the partition function. An important point here is that they performed the latter dif-
ferentiation via ﬁnite diﬀerence in order to eliminate the need of higher-order potential derivatives. Jang et al.,23 on
the other hand, avoided the appearance of second-order derivatives in a study on the Suzuki factorization by utilizing
an operator identity as well as the quantum mechanical virial theorem.

In this paper we present a method for evaluating virial estimators in discretized path integral without using higher-
order potential derivatives, which is based on the coordinate scaling idea of Janke and Sauer10 as well as the ﬁnite
diﬀerence method of Predescu et al..15 Speciﬁcally, we ﬁrst show that a simple scaling of ﬂuctuation coordinates
deﬁned in terms of a given reference point gives conventional virial estimators, where diﬀerent choices of the reference
point yields diﬀerent forms of the virial estimator (e.g., centroid virial). The above procedure reverts to the coordinate
scaling by Janke et al. when the reference point is taken to be the coordinate origin. We then evaluate the temperature
diﬀerentiation via ﬁnite diﬀerence in order to bypass the need of higher-order potential derivatives. The present

approach will be illustrated by an energy and heat capacity calculation for a cluster of 22 hydrogen molecules at
6 K using fourth-order composite factorization of the partition function together with the virial and double virial
estimators. This type of calculation requires formally up to third-order potential derivatives if analytical virial
estimators are used, but we are able to obtain essentially the same results using only up to ﬁrst-order derivatives by
virtue of the coordinate scaling and ﬁnite diﬀerence methods mentioned above.

The organization of this paper is as follows: In Sec. II we describe the scaling procedure as well as ﬁnite diﬀerence
In Sec. III, we present the application to a hydrogen cluster and carry out
evaluation of the potential action.
a systematic comparison among various propagators and estimators. We also examine the utility of higher-order
propagators in path integral molecular dynamics. In Sec. IV we conclude by mentioning possible applications of the
present approach for other purposes.

II. PATH INTEGRAL ESTIMATORS FOR ENERGY AND HEAT CAPACITY

A. Conventional estimators

We ﬁrst summarize the conventional thermodynamic6 and virial2,7,8 estimators for subsequent discussions. We
suppose a one-dimensional system with the Hamiltonian, ˆH = ˆT + ˆV = ˆp2/2m + V (ˆx), but the generalization to
multidimensional systems is straightforward. Using the primitive approximation to the canonical density operator,

the partition function at inverse temperature β = 1/kBT can be written as

−ǫ ˆH = e

−ǫ ˆV /2e

−ǫ ˆT e

the above estimator is that its variance grows with P , which occurs due to cancellation of the ﬁrst two terms in the
right-hand side of Eq. (5). This diﬃculty can be avoided by using the relation,

which is obtained via integration by parts. In Eq. (6), x∗ is a given “reference” point and g is a constant that depends
on the deﬁnition of x∗. In this paper we consider three choices of x∗, namely x∗ = 0, xP , and ˜x, where ˜x is the
centroid of the imaginary-time path given by

Noting that the kinetic action in Eq. (3) is a quadratic function of (x1, . . . , xP ) and is thus doubled by the “virial
operator” in the square bracket in Eq. (6), we have the following path integral virial theorem:

For subsequent use we will refer to the above estimator with x∗ = 0, xP , and ˜x as the origin-, bead-, and centroid-
reference virial estimators, respectively. We should emphasize here that the origin-reference virial estimator gives
an incorrect result for unbounded systems2 (e.g., εV vanishes for a free particle) although the bead- and centroid-
reference virial estimators remain valid. The reason for the former is that the integral of ρ(x1, . . . , xP ; β) over the
whole coordinate space is divergent, which invalidates Eq. (6), while in the latter the integration by parts can be
performed in one less dimensions with some coordinate ﬁxed (e.g., xP in the bead-reference virial). Despite these
diﬃculties, the origin-reference virial estimator can be applied to a quantum cluster if the contribution of the center
of mass is properly taken into account.11,14

Heat capacity estimators are obtained in a similar manner and are fully described in Ref. 13. The resulting double
thermodynamic estimator contains no potential derivatives but its variance grows rapidly as P 2. The double virial
estimator, on the other hand, has a favorable variance that is weakly dependent on P but requires second derivatives
of the potential, thus signiﬁcantly increasing computational cost.16

B. Virial estimator via scaling of coordinates

The virial estimator in Eq. (10) can also be obtained by scaling of ﬂuctuation coordinates as mentioned in the

Introduction. This is achieved by ﬁrst considering the partition function at a diﬀerent temperature β′:

where ρ is the same density function as Eq. (3). To eliminate ill-behaved terms in the thermodynamic estimator, we
introduce a new set of variables (x1, . . . , xP ) as

s
for s = 1, . . . , P . x∗ in Eq. (12) is a reference point that has the same meaning as in the previous section, i.e., x∗ = 0,
xP , or ˜x. The Jacobian of this transformation is

Taking the derivative with respect to β′ analytically gives the conventional virial estimator in Eq. (10). Here, we
instead evaluate the derivative via ﬁnite diﬀerence in order to avoid potential derivatives:15,34

(cid:29)

We want to emphasize here that the step size δβ can be taken suﬃciently small such that the estimate of energy and
heat capacity using Eqs. (18) and (20) are practically identical to those obtained with analytical virial estimators.
Our typical choice of δβ is 10−4β, with which we encountered no numerical troubles in the application to a quantum
cluster presented below. In fact, the ﬁnite diﬀerence in this section is intrinsically diﬀerent from, e.g., that for internal
energy,

CV (β) ≃

E(T + δT ) − E(T − δT )
2δT

,

which suﬀers severely from statistical noise when E(T ) is determined stochastically; the smallest value of δT is limited
by the requirement that |E(T + δT ) − E(T − δT )| is much larger than the statistical error in E(T ± δT ), while δβ in
Eqs. (18) and (20) suﬀers from no such conditions other than round-oﬀ errors.

C. Using fourth-order composite propagators

An appealing feature of the ﬁnite-diﬀerence scheme in Sec. II B is that it does not require potential derivatives higher
than those already existing in the approximate partition function. This means that energy and heat capacity can be
calculated with no potential derivatives if the primitive approximation is used, and only up to ﬁrst-order derivatives
are required when the fourth-order composite propagators are employed. The generalized Suzuki factorization17,18,23
and the Takahashi-Imada approximation19 fall into this category. The former approximates the exact short-time
propagator as

ˆ˜V e/3 + O(ǫ5),

where ˜Vm and ˜Ve are eﬀective potentials that involve ﬁrst-order potential derivatives (see Refs. 18 and 23 for more
details). With this factorization the approximate partition function becomes

can also be expressed in the form (24) with ws = 1 and ds = 1/24, although this approximation is not based on a
genuine factorization such as Eq. (22). Virial estimators can be obtained by complete analogy with Sec. II B, and the
only diﬀerence is that an ensemble average is now taken with respect to ρ(4) in Eq. (24), and that R(β′) in Eq. (16)

III. APPLICATION TO (H2)22 CLUSTER AT 6 K

To illustrate the above procedure, we calculated the internal energy and heat capacity of a cluster of 22 hydrogen
molecules at 6 K. The physical model employed is identical to that used in the previous studies.35,36,37 Brieﬂy, the
system potential consists of Lennard-Jones (LJ) pair interactions with ǫLJ = 34.2 K and σLJ = 2.96 ˚A, where the
hydrogen molecules are treated as distinguishable spherical particles with their mass being 2 amu. Since a cluster in
vacuum at any positive temperature is metastable with respect to evaporation, a conﬁning potential of the form,

Vc = ǫLJ

22

i=1 (cid:18)
X

|ri − R|
4σLJ (cid:19)

20

,

is added to the sum of LJ potentials to prevent any molecules from permanently leaving the cluster. In Eq. (30), ri
is the position of particle i while R is the center of mass of the cluster. At this temperature the system is in liquid
phase, and thus no ergodicity problem occurs in the subsequent calculation.

Statistical sampling of imaginary-time paths was performed with Monte Carlo (MC) methods, where one cycle is
deﬁned such that each particle is moved once on average by the staging algorithm.3,4,5 The implementation is the
same as described in Ref. 5. The staging length j (the number of beads that are collectively moved) was determined
by adjusting the acceptance ratio to 50 %, which resulted in j ≈ P/4 regardless of the Trotter number P . In addition
to the staging move, we applied the whole-chain move2 every two cycles to accelerate the statistical convergence. A
single run consisted of 105 cycles for equilibration and 4 × 106 cycles for data accumulation, which took several days
for P = 160 using a Pentium4 3.8 GHz workstation.

Tables I and II summarize the energy and heat capacity thus obtained with various propagators, where the centroid
virial estimator was used throughout based on the ﬁnite-diﬀerence scheme in Sec. II B. Figure 1 illustrates the
systematic convergence of several propagators to the asymptotic limit. From these results we see that the fourth-order
approximations improves remarkably upon the primitive approximation for both internal energy and heat capacity.
For example, the primitive approximation requires P >
∼ 200 to achieve a systematic error less than 0.25 K/molecule
in the internal energy,35,36,37 while the Suzuki approximation with α >
∼ 0.5 reaches that limit with only P = 60, thus
reducing the necessary value of P by a factor of ∼3. This result is also consistent with the ﬁnding of Brualla et al.,29
who calculated the internal energy of liquid 4He at 5.1 K using the Takahashi-Imada approximation and observed
similar acceleration in systematic convergence. The present result is encouraging since higher-order propagators are
known to be less eﬀective for hard-core systems due to the force square terms in Eq. (24).2,23,27

Comparing diﬀerent fourth-order propagators, we see that the Suzuki factorization with α = 1(0) gives the fastest
(slowest) convergence to the asymptotic limit, and also it slightly outperforms the Takahashi-Imada approximation
except for α = 0. This trend is in good agreement with the study by Jang et al. including a one-dimensional stiﬀ
potential model,23 which supports the idea that a larger value of α is more appropriate for hard-core systems when
physical properties are obtained via formal diﬀerentiation of the partition function.

Figure 2 depicts the statistical error in the energy and heat capacity obtained with diﬀerent estimators, where
the Suzuki approximation with α = 0.5 is used throughout. Statistical error in the other propagators are similar to
those in Fig. 2. The ﬁrst point to note is that the thermodynamic estimator has a large variance that grows with P
as expected, and this growth is more pronounced for heat capacity. On the other hand, the statistical error in the

FIG. 2: Statistical error in (a) internal energy (K/molecule) and (b) heat capacity (in unit of kB) as a function of the Trotter
number P . Five diﬀerent energy estimators are used: the thermodynamic estimator, the virial estimator with three choices
of the reference point (origin, bead, and centroid), and the modiﬁed virial estimator in Eq. (31). The virial estimators are
evaluated based on the ﬁnite diﬀerence scheme in Sec. II B. In heat capacity calculations, double thermodynamic and double
virial estimators are used rather than a mixed estimator (Ref. 13). Details of error estimate are given in the caption of Table
I, and errors in the heat capacity (i.e., a biased quantity) were estimated using the prescription given in Ref. 15.

virial estimator depends on the choice of the reference point x∗; the origin-reference virial estimator exhibits quite
large variance whereas the bead- and centroid-reference estimators have small variances that are weakly dependent
on P . Thus, we ﬁnd that it is deﬁnitely better to choose x∗ as xP or ˜x rather than the coordinate origin. The above
observation seems relevant to large statistical errors encountered by Neirotti et al.14 in their Fourier path integral
calculation for the heat capacity of a Ne13 cluster, because the reference point was eﬀectively set to the coordinate
origin due to the application of a virial operator that relates to a uniform scaling of all the atomic coordinates [Eq. (13)
in Ref. 14]. In contrast, Predescu et al.15 obtained a highly converged heat capacity for the same system using random
series path integral, where the reference point was set to the physical coordinates (or a single bead) that deﬁnes the
end points of the Brownian bridge, and an implicit virial operation was performed only for the internal ﬂuctuation
coordinates through temperature diﬀerentiation.

Fourth-order propagators become computationally expensive if directly implemented in path integral molecular
dynamics.5,8 The reason is that in such a method the discretized action is employed as an external potential for the
beads, and thus second-order potential derivatives are required if the fourth-order density in Eq. (24) is used as the
sampling function. This can be avoided simply by excluding the force square terms in Eq. (26) from the sampling
function and treat them as a part of estimators.23 The resulting modiﬁed expression for the internal energy is

This method gives the true expected value of energy as P is increased, but the statistical error becomes larger than
the original scheme in Sec. II C.23 Figure 2 shows statistical error obtained with the above modiﬁed scheme together
with the centroid virial estimator. From this ﬁgure we see that the variance becomes quite large for small values
of P , but it is reduced to a manageable size if P is increased to 40 or larger. Thus, excluding force square terms
from the sampling function seems a viable option in path integral molecular dynamics approach. Another point to
mention is that ρmod in Eq. (33) becomes identical to that for the primitive approximation if the Takahashi-Imada

approximation is used. The result of the latter approximation can therefore be obtained with no extra cost within a
conventional calculation based on the primitive approximation.

Finally, we examine the performance of the Richardson extrapolation.29 The basic idea is to use several results with
diﬀerent values of P and extrapolate them to the inﬁnite P limit. For the present purpose the asymptotic convergence
can be approximated as

fP ≃ f∞ +

A
P δ +

B
P δ+2 ,

where δ is 2 and 4 for the primitive and fourth-order approximations, respectively. In Eq. (34), fP is the internal
energy or heat capacity estimated with a given value of P whereas f∞ is the value corresponding to P = ∞. Our
task is then to solve a linear equation for (f∞, A, B) using three diﬀerent values of (P, fP ).38 Tables III and IV list
the extrapolated values, which show that the primitive approximation with extrapolation performs rather closely to
the fourth-order Suzuki approximation. Therefore, if the convergence is found to be monotonic in P , the Richardson
extrapolation is quite beneﬁcial in accelerating eﬀective convergence with no extra cost. On the other hand, if highly
accurate results are desired without ambiguity, the fourth-order propagator is a method of choice particularly when
the ﬁrst-order potential derivatives are readily available.

IV. CONCLUDING REMARKS

In this paper we have explored the use of coordinate scaling to implement virial estimators without higher-order
potential derivatives, and applied the obtained scheme to fourth-order composite propagators such as the Suzuki
approximation. The present scheme should be useful in ab initio path integral methods where higher-order potential
derivatives are often unavailable or extremely costly. There are other cases where coordinate scaling may ﬁnd some
utility. One such example is the short-time approximation to a quantum dynamical correlation function, CAB(t). In
the simplest case one may approximate it as

CAB(t) = CAB(0) +

¨CAB(0)t2 + · · · ≃ CAB(0) exp

An interesting point here is that the real-time derivatives at t = 0 may be evaluated along the imaginary-time axis
in the complex t plane, which transforms the path integral calculation of ¨CAB(0) into that similar to heat capacity.
Hence, there appear a number of possibilities for diﬀerent estimators, and we may apply the coordinate scaling idea
to generate a low-variance estimator. Such an approach is particularly relevant, e.g., to reaction rate theory based on
the ﬂux–ﬂux correlation function39,40,41,42 and vibrational relaxation based on the force–force correlation function.43
Another possible application is for path integral ground state (or variational path integral) methods,2,44,45 where
several diﬀerent estimators arise and a similar improvement may be achieved via the present procedure.

We present a theoretical study of dielectrophoretic (DEP) crossover spectrum of two polarizable particles
under the action of a nonuniform AC electric ﬁeld. For two approaching particles, the mutual polarization
interaction yields a change in their respective dipole moments, and hence, in the DEP crossover spectrum. The
induced polarization effects are captured by the multiple image method. Using spectral representation theory,
an analytic expression for the DEP force is derived. We ﬁnd that the mutual polarization effects can change the
crossover frequency at which the DEP force changes sign. The results are found to be in agreement with recent
experimental observation and as they go beyond the standard theory, they help to clarify the important question
of the underlying polarization mechanisms.

INTRODUCTION

When a polarizable particle is subjected to an applied elec-
tric ﬁeld, a dipole moment is induced into it. The movement
of colloidal particles in an applied AC electric ﬁeld is called
dielectrophoresis [1]. It is typically used for micromanipula-
tion and separation of biological cellular size particles, and
it has recently been successfully applied to submicron size
particles as well. Speciﬁc applications include diverse prob-
lems in medicine, colloidal science and nanotechnology, e.g.
separation of nanowires [2], viruses [3], latex spheres [4, 5],
DNA [6] and leukemic cells [7], as well as lab-on-a-chip de-
signs [8].

The dielectrophoretic (DEP) force exerted on a particle can
be either attractive or repulsive depending on the polariz-
ability of the particle in comparison to the medium. For a
nonuniform AC electric ﬁeld, the magnitude and the direc-
tion of the DEP force depends on the frequency, changes in
surface charge-density and free charges in the vicinity of the
particle. The frequency at which the DEP force changes its
sign is called the crossover frequency (fCF). Analysis of the
crossover frequency as a function of the host medium conduc-
tivity can be used to characterize the dielectric properties of
particles, and is at present the principal method of DEP anal-
ysis for submicrometer particles [3, 4].

In the dilute limit, i.e, when a small volume fraction of
charged particles are suspended in an aqueous electrolyte so-
lution, one can focus on the DEP spectrum of an individual
particle ignoring the mutual interactions between the particles.
Although the current theory [1] captures some of the essential
physics in the dilute case, it is not adequate [9, 10, 11, 12, 13].
This is due to the fact that even for a single colloidal particle
in an electrolyte, it is not established which mechanisms con-

trol its dielectric properties. If the suspension is not dilute,
the situation becomes even more complicated due to the mu-
tual interactions between the particles. One should also note
that particles may aggregate due to the presence of an exter-
nal ﬁeld, even when the suspension is at the dilute limit under
zero ﬁeld conditions. In this case, the mutual interactions have
to be included in the description.

In this article, we present a theoretical study of the DEP
spectrum of two spherical particles in the presence of a
nonuniform AC electric ﬁeld. We use the multiple image
method [14], which is able to capture the mutual polarization
effects. Using the spectral representation theory [15], we de-
rive an analytic expression for the DEP force and determine
the crossover frequency. Our theoretical analysis shows that
the induced mutual polarization interactions plays an impor-
tant role in DEP spectrum. In a more general framework, our
results demonstrate the importance of correlation effects. This
is analogous to the ﬁndings in charged systems where phe-
nomena such as overcharging, or charge inversion (see e.g.
Refs. [16, 17]), provide spectacular demonstrations of corre-
lation effects.

As our starting point, we consider a pair of interacting
charged colloidal particles dispersed in an electrolyte solution.
When the two particles approach each other, the mutual po-
larization interaction between them leads to changes in their
respective dipole moments [18], and hence also in the DEP
spectrum and crossover frequency. We analyze two cases: 1)
longitudinal ﬁeld (L), in which the ﬁeld is parallel to the line
joining the centers of particles, and 2) transverse ﬁeld (T) in
which the ﬁeld is perpendicular. The former corresponds to
positive dielectrophoresis where a particle is attracted to re-
gions of high ﬁeld and the latter to the opposite case, referred
to as negative dielectrophoresis.

This paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II we present
the formalism and derive analytic expressions for the effec-
tive dipole factors in spectral representation. In Sec. III, we
use the analytical results to numerically solve the crossover
frequency, dispersion strength and DEP spectra under differ-
ent conditions. This is followed by a discussion of the results
in Sec. IV.

II. FORMALISM AND ANALYSIS

First, we consider a single charged spherical particle sus-
pended in an electrolyte and subjected to a nonuniform AC
electric ﬁeld. The DEP force FDEP acting on the particle is
then given by [19]

FDEP =

πǫ2D3Re[b]

where D is particle diameter, ǫ2 the real dielectric constant of
host medium, E the local RMS electric ﬁeld, and Re[b] the
real part of the dipole factor (also called Clausius-Mossotti
factor)

(1)

(2)

Here, ˜ǫ1 and ˜ǫ2 are the complex dielectric constants of the par-
ticle and the host medium, respectively. In order for the two
above equations to be valid in an AC ﬁeld, the dielectric con-
stant must include dependence on the frequency. The complex
frequency dependent dielectric constant is deﬁned as

b =

˜ǫ2

˜ǫ1 + 2˜ǫ2

.

˜ǫ = ǫ +

where ǫ is the real dielectric constant, σ denotes conductivity,
f the frequency of the external ﬁeld, and i

The conductivity of a particle consists of three components:
Its bulk conductivity (σ1bulk), surface effects due to the move-
ment of charge in the diffuse double layer (conductance kd),
and the Stern layer conductance (ks), i.e.,

where u is the surface charge density, Σ molar conductivity
for a given electrolyte, and µr gives the ratio between the ion
mobility in the Stern layer to that in the medium.

For a pair of particles at a separation R suspended in an
electrolyte, we have to consider the multiple image effect. We
consider two spheres in a medium, and apply a uniform elec-
tric ﬁeld E0 = E0 ˆz to the suspension. This induces a dipole
moment into each of the particles. The dipole moments of par-
p10 = ǫ2E0D3b/8),
ticles 1 and 2 are given by p10 and p20(
respectively.

≡

Next, we include the image effects. The dipole moment p10
induces an image dipole p11 into sphere 2, while p11 induces
another image dipole in sphere 1. As a result, multiple images
are formed. Similarly, p20 induces an image p21 into colloid
1. The formation of multiple images leads to an inﬁnite series
of image dipoles.

In the following, we obtain the sum of dipole moments
inside each particle, and derive the desired expressions for
dipole factors. We consider two basic cases: 1) longitudinal
ﬁeld (L), where the ﬁeld is parallel to the line joining the cen-
ters of particles, and 2) transverse ﬁeld (T), where the ﬁeld is
perpendicular to the line joining the centers of particles. Us-
ing the above notation, the effective dipole factors for a pair
are given by [14]

We have to derive the analytic expressions for Re[b∗

Re[b∗

resort to spectral representation theory. It offers the advan-
tage of being able to separate the material parameters (such as
dielectric constant and conductivity) from structural informa-
tion [15] in a natural way.

Let us begin by deﬁning a complex material parameter ˜s =
˜ǫ1/˜ǫ2). Using this, the dipole factor for a pair takes the

III. NUMERICAL RESULTS

The above formalism enables us to study the effects due
to multiple images under different physical conditions and to
compare the theory to experimental results. In the following,
we compare the crossover frequency of an isolated particle to
that of two particles at different separations. We study the ef-
fects due to multiple images by varying medium conductivity,
the ζ-potential, medium viscosity, surface charge density, real
dielectric constant of the particle and molar conductivity. Fi-
nally, we have computed the DEP spectrum and the dispersion
strength.

The common parameters used in all numerical computa-
tions are the following: Temperature T0 = 293 K, dielectric
constant of host medium ǫ2 = 78ǫ0, bulk conductivity of the

Figure 1 shows the DEP crossover frequency as a func-
tion of medium conductivity for an isolated particle and for
two particles at different separations. In agreement with re-
cent experiments [22], we ﬁnd that a peak in the crossover
frequency appears at a certain medium conductivity. The ap-
pearance of a peak is preceded by an increase of fCF upon
increasing medium conductivity and followed by an abrupt
drop [11, 22]. Compared to an isolated particle, the multiple
image effect leads to a red-shift (blue-shift) in fCF in the lon-
gitudinal (transverse) ﬁeld case. Furthermore, for longitudi-
nal (transverse) ﬁeld, the stronger the polarization interaction,
the lower (higher) the crossover frequency. In addition, it is
worth noting that the effect of the multiple images is the op-
posite in the longitudinal and transverse cases. As the ratio
R/D grows, the predicted crossover spectrum approaches to
that of an isolated particle, i.e., at large separations the multi-
ple image interaction becomes negligible.

Motivated by a recent experiment [13], we analyzed the ef-
fect of particle size on the crossover frequency by keeping the

ratio R/D ﬁxed and varying the particle diameter. In agree-
ment with the experiments, we ﬁnd that the location of the
peak is shifted to higher frequencies and higher conductivities
when the diameter of the particle is reduced, see Fig. 2.

Figure 3 displays the effect of the ζ-potential. It has been
experimentally observed by Hughes and Green [11] that de-
creasing the ζ-potential may red-shift the DEP crossover fre-
quency. The system used by them contained many latex beads
suspended in a solution, and hence the multipolar interaction
is expected to play a role. Our results are in qualitative agree-
ment with the above experimental ﬁndings. Furthermore, an
increase in the ζ-potential leads to higher fCF in both the lon-
gitudinal and transverse ﬁeld cases. Similarly, increasing the
real part of the dielectric constant leads to an increase in fCF,
as displayed in Fig. 4. Increasing the viscosity of the medium
(ﬁgure not shown here), however, has exactly the opposite ef-
fect for both the longitudinal and transverse ﬁeld cases.

Figure 5 shows the effect of molar conductivity Σ on
crossover frequency. For small medium conductivities (here,
σ2 < 10−2 S/m), increasing Σ leads to an increase in the
crossover frequency. However, there is a crossover after which

lower values of Σ yield higher fCF. Similar behavior for the
low surface conductivity regime has been observed in exper-
iments [11], but the authors are not aware of any systematic
study of the molar conductivity on fCF. As Fig. 5 shows, the
effect is similar for both longitudinal and transverse ﬁelds.

Figure 6 shows the effect of varying the surface charge
density on the crossover frequency. Variations in the surface
charge density lead to more pronounced effects in the low fre-
quency region, but close to the peak the variations differences
are very small. In addition, the location of the peak is only
weakly dependent on surface charge density. These results
are in agreement with the experimental observations of Green
and Morgan [13].

In Fig. 7, we investigate the real part of the dipole factor,
and thus the DEP force. The ﬁgure shows that the effect due
to multiple image plays an important role at low frequency
region when the particles separation is not large, whereas its
effect is smaller in the high frequency region. In the low fre-
quency region, the DEP force is be enhanced (reduced) due to
the presence of multiple images for longitudinal (transverse)
ﬁeld case. As the particle separation grows, the multiple im-

age effect becomes negligible as expected. We also studied
the effect of particle size on the real part of the dipole factor
and the effect of multiple images increases as the particle size
decreases, and the effect is stronger in the longitudinal ﬁeld
case.

mc and f (T )

Finally, in Fig. 8, we plot the dispersion strengths (∆ǫ(L)
and ∆ǫ(T )
m ) as a function of the characteristic frequencies
(f (L)
mc ), for m = 1 to 100 with different medium con-
ductivities σ2. Here, m is a positive integer, and Fm and sm
are the microstructure parameters of the composite material,
see Eqs. 11-13. Hence, ∆ǫm and fmc are the m-th dispersion
strength and characteristic frequency due to the presence of
multiple images as discussed in Sec. II.

The advantage of using the spectral representation theory
is shown in Fig. 8. Based on Fig. 7, it may appear that
only one dispersion exist. Figure 8 shows, however, that sub-
dispersions with strength ∆ǫm and characteristic frequency
fmc co-exist, and most of them lie close to the main disper-
sion. Thus, the spectral representation theory helps us to gain
more detailed information about the system and it provides a

At a given σ2, for the longitudinal (transverse) ﬁeld case,
increasing m leads to corresponding sub-dispersions in the
characteristic frequency due to the presence of multiple im-
ages. The crossover frequencies fc are 3.49

10−4 S/m), mul-
lower medium conductivity (say, σ2 = 1.0
tiple images have a stronger effect on the DEP spectrum for
the longitudinal ﬁeld case than for the transverse ﬁeld. This
is also apparent in Fig. 7 as well. Moreover, for longitudinal
ﬁeld case the multiple images play a role in the low frequency
range (i.e., smaller than fc). For the transverse ﬁeld the situa-
10−3 S/m
tion is the opposite. At a larger σ2 (say, σ2 = 5.0
10−2 S/m ), the sub-dispersion strengths for
or σ2 = 1.0
the two cases have only a minor difference. These observa-
tions may partly explain the results of Green and Morgan [13]
whose data suggests that there exists a dispersion below the
frequencies predicted by the current theory. The importance
of these observation lies in the fact that they help to clarify
the interesting question of which polarization mechanisms are

IV. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

In this study, we have investigated the crossover spectrum
of two approaching polarizable particles in the presence of
a nonuniform AC electric ﬁeld. When the two particles ap-
proach, the mutual polarization interaction between the par-
ticles leads to changes in the dipole moments of each of the
individual particles, and hence in the DEP crossover spectrum.
This can be interpreted as a correlation effect analogous to the
ones seen in charged systems [16].

For charged particles, there is a coexistence of an elec-
trophoretic and a dielectrophoretic force in the presence of
a nonuniform AC electric ﬁeld. The DEP force always points
toward the region of high ﬁeld gradient.
It does not oscil-
late with the change of direction of the ﬁeld. In contrast, the
electrophoretic force points along the direction of ﬁeld, and
hence is oscillatory under the same conditions. How to sepa-
rate the DEP force from the electrophoretic force is a question

frequency ranges, either the electrophoretic force or the DEP
force dominates, and the transition from one to the other oc-

curs at a frequency ftr, which has been approximately deter-
mined [4]. Here, we have chosen a frequency region where
electrophoretic effects are negligible and the DEP force dom-
inates.
In addition, although we are at ﬁnite temperature,
Brownian motion is not included in our analysis. In experi-
ments Brownian motion is always present and has posed difﬁ-
culties in dielectrophoresis of submicrometer particles. How-
ever, with current techniques it is possible to access also this
range [4, 5].

One of the interesting questions is what happens, when the
volume fraction of the suspension becomes large. It turns out
that it is possible to extend our approach by taking into ac-
count local ﬁeld effects which may modify the DEP crossover
spectrum. Work is in progress to address these questions. In
addition to dielectrophoresis, the extension of the present ap-
proach is also of interest from the point of view of electroro-
tation.

To summarize, using the multiple image method, we have
been able to capture mutual polarization effects of two ap-
proaching particles in an electrolyte. Using spectral represen-
tation theory, we derived an analytic expression for the DEP
force, and using that the crossover frequency was determined.
From the theoretical analysis, we ﬁnd that the mutual polariza-
tion effects can change the crossover frequency substantially.

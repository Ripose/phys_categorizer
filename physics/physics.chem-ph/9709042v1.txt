Free energies of ionic solvation calculated from computer simulations exhibit a strong system size
dependence. We perform a ﬁnite-size analysis based on a dielectric-continuum model with periodic
boundary conditions. That analysis results in an estimate of the Born ion size. Remarkably, the
ﬁnite-size correction applies to systems with only eight water molecules hydrating a sodium ion and
results in an estimate of the Born radius of sodium that agrees with the experimental value.

Calculation of ionic-hydration free energies from computer simulations require great care to avoid artifacts due
to the long-range electrostatic interactions. We have recently shown that Ewald summation1,2 can give results for
single-ion free energies that are essentially system-size independent for as few as about 16 water molecules.3 That has
been achieved by including the self-interactions 0.5q2ξEw of the ion (ξEw ≈ −2.837297/L with L the length of the
cubic box). Ewald summation determines the electrostatic interactions using lattice sums for a periodically replicated
simulation box. This provides a natural description of the electrostatics in the periodic space resulting from the
periodic boundary conditions commonly used in computer simulations. Deviations from the approximate ﬁnite-size
correction3,4 are expected for solvents with ﬁnite dielectric constant ǫ < ∞ (i.e., in the inﬁnite-dilution limit of an
ion in a non-conducting solvent),5,6 and if the ion size is comparable to the dimensions of the simulation box.

The self-interaction of an ion is introduced in the Ewald summation through interactions with the compensating
charge background implicit in the Ewald summation approach and with the periodic images of the ion. A similar
correction has been developed for free energies of polar molecules.4 Figueirido et al.5 used a point ion in a homogeneous
dielectric medium as a model to extend the system-size corrections to solvents with ﬁnite dielectric constants ǫ, ﬁnding
that 0.5q2ξEw(1 − 1/ǫ) should be a good approximation to the ﬁnite-size eﬀects. Here, we further extend Figueirido
et al.’s study5 to ions of ﬁnite size. We show that the ion-size correction is important for small system sizes. We also
show that the analysis of the system-size dependence of ionic free energies leads to the deﬁnition of an ion size in
dielectric media in excellent agreement with the Born radius.7

We approximate the free energy of charging an ion as the sum of the explicit simulation contribution Fsim and a
self-interaction 0.5q2ξEw, as in Ref. 3. To account for further eﬀects of ﬁnite system size, we add the diﬀerence of
charging an ion in an inﬁnite and ﬁnite system, F∞ − FL,

F0 = Fsim +

q2ξEw + (F∞ − FL)

The ﬁnite-size correction F∞ − FL is evaluated for a simpliﬁed model of a point charge q in a spherical cavity with
radius R inside a dielectric continuum with dielectric constant ǫ, as schematically shown in Fig. 1. The ﬁnite system
is formed by an ion in a periodically replicated box of length L, where the box is charge neutral through addition of a
homogeneous background charge with density −q/L3. The inﬁnite system is obtained by taking the limit L → ∞ and
corresponds to the Born model.7 If the model used to calculate F∞ − FL were exact, FL would cancel Fsim + 0.5q2ξEw.
However, the dielectric model is only an approximation to the simulation system with explicit solvent, making the
ﬁnite-size correction only approximate.

The ﬁnite-size correction is the diﬀerence of charging the ion in an inﬁnite (L → ∞) and ﬁnite system,

ξ(ǫ, R, L) is the electrostatic potential minus the bare self-interaction at the position of a unit charge,

We determine the electrostatic potential φ(r) for the dielectric model described above by solving the corresponding
Poisson equation,

We deﬁne potentials φ−(r) and φ+(r) inside and outside the sphere. For R < L/2, the boundary conditions are

The last condition reﬂects the periodicity of the potential and applies analogously for y and z.

To solve this electrostatic problem, we expand φ− and φ+ into a complete set of functions that satisfy Poisson’s
equation Eq. (4) and then choose the expansion coeﬃcients to satisfy the boundary conditions Eq. (5). Such functions
are the kubic-harmonic polynomials Kn introduced by von der Lage and Bethe.8 We deﬁne

For a ﬁnite set of functions K2n up to polynomial order 2n ≤ N , the solution is only approximate. We choose the

with spherical polar coordinates r, ϕ and θ. The last integral extends only over a circular region because this results
in an analytical solution of that integral. Also, the deviations from Eq. (5c) of truncated kubic-harmonic expansions
of the Ewald potential4,9–11 are largest in the corners of the box. Fitting only a circular region therefore produces
smaller distortions of the potential at the center of the box.

Minimizing χ2 with respect to the coeﬃcients b−1, b0, a4, b4 etc. results in a set of linear equations for those
coeﬃcients. Using the computational algebra package REDUCE,12 we solve for the unknown expansion coeﬃcients
for diﬀerent orders N of the kubic-harmonic expansion. We then apply Taylor expansion with respect to 1/ǫ and the
size parameter R/L. This results in an asymptotic expansion of ξ(ǫ, R, L) as

rather than φ(r) → 0 for r → ∞. The familiar Born term 0.5(1 − ǫ−1)/R is thus contained in the normalization
constant C.

The coeﬃcients c0, c2 and c4 are listed in Table I. As the order N of expansion functions increases, the coeﬃcient
c0 converges towards the self-energy of a point charge in a cubic Wigner lattice,15 c0 → LξEw ≈ −2.837297. The
coeﬃcients c2 and c4 appear to converge to values close to zero. The most interesting term in Eq. (8) is the lowest
order correction for the ﬁnite size of an ion, −2π(ǫ − 1)R2/(3ǫL3). Eq. (8) converges to the correct limit for ǫ → ∞,
which can be found independently using the continuity of φ(r) at the dielectric interface |r| = R and the spherical
geometry for ǫ → ∞,

We can now calculate the ﬁnite-size correction to the free energy of an ion with radius R in a dielectric medium

using Eq. (2) and ξ(ǫ, R, L → ∞) = 0 for the particular choice of C [Eq. (9)]. This results in an approximation to the
free energy F0 of charging the ion including ﬁnite-size eﬀects:

(cid:18)
In the limit ǫ → ∞, the ﬁnite-size correction F∞ − FL does not contain terms of order L−1 and L−2. This explains
the success of using Fsim + 0.5q2ξEw alone for the free energy of charging an ion in a conducting11 or highly polar3
environment, without further ﬁnite-size correction that takes the ion size or the dielectric constant of the solvent into
account.

(cid:19)

The validity of the approximate ﬁnite-size correction Eq. (12) is illustrated in Fig. 2 for a sodium ion in water. We
ﬁt the sodium-ion data Fsim for electrostatic free energies calculated from simulations with M = 8 to M = 256 water
molecules3 to Eq. (12) with F0 and R as parameters. For the dielectric constant, ǫ → ∞ is used, but values of ǫ ≈ 80
have little eﬀect on the result. That ﬁt yields F0 = −402.5 ± 1 kJ mol−1 for the electrostatic contribution to the
solvation free energy of sodium. The radius R of the sodium ion is found to be R = 0.18 nm, in excellent agreement
with the eﬀective Born radius 0.180 nm of that ion, as determined by Latimer, Pitzer and Slansky16 or, more recently,
0.188 nm, as compiled by Marcus.17 In the ﬁt, the ion radius R is determined mostly by the data for small system
sizes. Using only the M = 8 and 16 data and ﬁxing F0 at −402.5 kJ mol−1, a ﬁt of R yields 0.159 nm (M = 16),
0.190 nm (M = 8) and 0.184 nm (M = 8 and 16).

The simulation result for the Born radius is 0.172 nm.3 That is, F0 and R are self-consistent assuming an uncertainty
greater than 0.01 nm in R. We can therefore ﬁt the free-energy data with the solvation free energy F0 as the only
parameter by substituting the Born expression F0 ≈ −0.5q2(1 − ǫ−1)/R for R,

That ﬁt yields F0 = −403 ± 1 kJ mol−1 (for ǫ → ∞). These results show that the system-size eﬀects on the hydration
of sodium can be described accurately for M ≥ 8 water molecules by the dielectric continuum model with periodic
boundary conditions shown in Fig. 1. It is remarkable that continuum-electrostatics approximations apply even for
as few as eight water molecules solvating the sodium ion provided the periodic boundary conditions are considered.
Of course, determination of the value of F0 and the Born radius requires further molecular considerations. To treat
solutes with more complicated shapes will require additional computational eﬀort, as was suggested previously.18

In summary, we have found an approximate ﬁnite-size correction for ions in water that takes into account the size
of the ions as well as the dielectric constant of the solvent. These ﬁndings extend the previous work by Hummer
et al.3,4,11 and Figueirido et al.5,13 The results of Refs. 3 and 11 are recovered in the limit of a conducting solvent
(ǫ → ∞) and a point ion R/L → 0. In the limit of a point ion but for a ﬁnite dielectric constant ǫ < ∞, we obtain
the ﬁnite-size correction of Ref. 5. For strongly polar solvents, such as water (ǫ ≈ 80), and typical system sizes of
hundred or more solvent molecules with ions of comparable size, the diﬀerence to the ﬁnite-size correction obtained
previously3,4 for ǫ → ∞ and R/L → 0 will be small (<
∼ 1-2%). We have found that the ﬁnite-size correction derived
in this paper gives qualitatively and quantitatively correct behavior. This ﬁnite-size analysis results in an estimate of
the sodium-ion size that is in agreement with the experimental data.

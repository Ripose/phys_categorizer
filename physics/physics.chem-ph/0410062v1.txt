By splitting the Coulomb interaction into long-range and short-range components, we decompose
the energy of a quantum electronic system into long-range and short-range contributions. We show
that the long-range part of the energy can be eﬃciently calculated by traditional wave function
methods, while the short-range part can be handled by a density functional. The analysis of this
functional with respect to the range of the associated interaction reveals that, in the limit of a very
short-range interaction, the short-range exchange-correlation energy can be expressed as a simple
local functional of the on-top pair density and its ﬁrst derivatives. This provides an explanation for
the accuracy of the local density approximation (LDA) for the short-range functional. Moreover,
this analysis leads also to new simple approximations for the short-range exchange and correlation
energies improving the LDA.

I.

INTRODUCTION

In the Kohn-Sham (KS) approach [1] of density func-
tional theory (DFT) [2] of inhomogeneous electronic sys-
tems, the central quantity is the unknown exchange-
correlation energy functional Exc[n] which encompasses
all the many-body eﬀects. The vast majority of approx-
imations for this functional are based on the original lo-
cal density approximation (LDA) [2], an approximation
that turned out to be more accurate and reliable than
expected and rather diﬃcult to improve in a systematic
way [3].

Actually, it has been realized for long, with the wave-
vector analysis of Exc[n] by Langreth and Perdew [4],
that the LDA describes accurately (but not exactly in
general [5]) short wavelength density ﬂuctuations, but
is inadequate for long wavelength ﬂuctuations. A dual
analysis in real space of the exchange-correlation en-
ergy (see, e.g., Ref. 6) leads to the same conclusion
that the LDA is accurate at small interelectronic dis-
tances but fails at large distances. This observation lead
to the development of the ﬁrst gradient corrected func-
tionals [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12] with the basic objective to
cure the wrong long-range contribution to the exchange-
correlation energy of the LDA.

However, describing accurately the non-local correla-
tion eﬀects arising from the long-range character of the
Coulomb interaction by (semi)local density functional
approximations still seems out of reach. This idea in
mind, it is has been proposed to use a density functional
approximation only for the short-range part of the elec-
tronic energy, and treating the long-range part by more
appropriate many-body methods [13, 14, 15, 16, 17].
This approach was somehow inspired from early calcula-
tions of the correlation energy of the uniform electron gas

based on a separate treatment of long-range and short-
range contributions (see, e.g., Refs. 18, 19, 20).

For atoms and molecules, this approach leads to a rig-
orous method for combining traditional ab initio wave
function calculations with DFT [21, 22], and we recall
now the formalism. The Coulomb electron-electron in-
teraction is decomposed as

ee and external lo-
cal potential ˆV µ =
i vµ(ri) where vµ(r) = vne(r) +
δ ¯F µ[nΨµ ]/δn(r). By virtue of the Hohenberg-Kohn the-
orem [2], vµ(r) is the unique potential (up to an additive
constant) which insures that the ground-state density of
this ﬁctitious system is identical to the ground-state den-
sity of the physical system nΨµ = n.

The short-range functional ¯F µ[n] is further decom-

posed as

chosen for ¯Eµ
xc[n], the wave function Ψµ can be computed
by solving self-consistently Eq. (5) using ab initio wave
function methods like conﬁguration interaction (CI) or
multi-conﬁgurational self-consistency ﬁeld (MCSCF) and
the total energy is calculated according to the last line
of Eq. (4). Notice also that it is possible to separate the

been eﬃciently implemented into the quantum chem-
istry program Dalton, performing the coupling of MC-
SCF wave function calculations with DFT [25]. For a
reasonable long-range/short-range separation and using
only the LDA for ¯Eµ
xc[n], the approach already yields
good results for total energies of atomic and molecular
systems [21, 22, 25]. The purpose of this paper is to ana-
lyzed in further details the two separate needed approx-
imations of the method: the wave function calculation
of Eq. (5) and the short-range exchange-correlation func-
tional ¯Eµ
xc[n]. Accurate calculations have been performed
on a few small atomic systems to assess the approxima-
tions. Concerning the wave function part, we show that
the modiﬁcation of the interaction enables to decrease
the eﬀort, or alternatively increase the accuracy, of a CI-
type calculation. Concerning the functional part, we gain
more insights into the short-range functional and explain
the performance of the LDA by studying the behavior
of ¯Eµ
xc[n] with respect to the interaction parameter µ.
In particular, we show that, when the interaction ¯vµ
ee is
short ranged enough, ¯Eµ
xc[n] can be expressed as a sim-
ple local functional of the on-top pair density and its ﬁrst
derivatives, explaining the accuracy of (semi)local func-
tional approximations. This analysis also enables us to
propose new approximations for ¯Eµ
xc[n] which correct the
LDA in the domain of µ where it fails.

The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we give
two possible choices for the long-range interaction vµ
ee(r).
In Sec. III, technical details concerning the calculations
made on atomic systems are given. In Sec. IV, the impact
of the modiﬁcation of the interaction on the performance
of wave function calculation is investigated. In Sec. V,
we study the behavior of the corresponding short-range
exchange and correlation functionals with respect to the
interaction parameter µ. In Sec. VI, we test the obtained
exact behaviors and compared them with the LDA. In
Sec VII, interpolations for the short-range exchange and
correlation functionals with respect to µ are proposed
and tested. Finally, Sec VIII draws a conclusion of this
work.

Atomic units (a.u.) will be used throughout this work.

The method has been implemented at an experimen-

In a number of previous works [17, 21, 22, 26, 27], a
splitting of the Coulomb interaction based on the error
function has been studied to describe the long-range part
of the electron-electron interaction

This interaction, referred to as the erf interaction, has
also been used by other authors in DFT for various pur-
poses [28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35]. In this work, we
introduce another interaction achieving a sharper sepa-
ration of long-range and short-range interactions by sub-

tracting a Gaussian function from the erf interaction

where the coeﬃcient and the exponent of the Gaussian
have been chosen so that vµ
ee,erfgau(r) and its derivative
with respect to r vanish at r = 0. This modiﬁed in-
teraction is referred to as the erfgau interaction. No-
tice that this partition of Coulomb interaction has al-
ready been proposed by Gill and Adamson [28].
In
another context, Prendergast et al. [36] have also used
a similar form of long-range interaction. For the sake
of completeness, we ﬁnally note that another possible
form of modiﬁed electron-electron interaction based on
the Yukawa potential has also been investigated in the
past [13, 14, 15, 16, 37, 38].

Both interactions (11) and (12) enable to deﬁne a
generalized adiabatic connection [39] between the non-
interacting KS system at µ = 0 where the interac-
tion vanishes vµ=0
(r) = 0, and the physical system at

Notice that, although we have chosen the same no-
tation for convenience, the parameter µ in Eq. (11) is
a priori independent of that of Eq. (12). Actually, in
all the plots of the paper involving the erfgau interac-
tion, we apply a scale factor to the interaction parameter
cµ. The constant c is
of the erfgau interaction: µ
chosen so as to have the same leading term in the dis-
tributional asymptotic expansion of the two interactions
(see Appendix C) which leads to the value

c =
3.375. This also insures that the
leading term in the asymptotic expansion of short-range
Hartree, exchange and correlation energies for large µ is
the same for the two interactions. In Fig. 1, the erf and
erfgau interactions are compared along with the Coulomb
interaction. The scale factor on the parameter of the er-
fgau interaction enables to deﬁne a common “cut-oﬀ ra-
dius” giving the range of the interaction and deﬁned by
1/µ. For
the inverse of the interaction parameter rc ≈
interelectronic distances larger than rc, the two modi-
ﬁed interactions reproduce the long-range Coulomb tail.
Notice that short-range interactions are better removed
with the erfgau interaction.

We ﬁnally note that, for Gaussian basis set calcula-
tions, the evaluation of the two-electron integrals cor-
responding to the erf or erfgau interaction requires only
simple modiﬁcations of standard algorithms for Coulomb
integrals (see Appendix A).

IV. PERFORMANCE OF THE
APPROXIMATIONS FOR THE WAVE
FUNCTION CALCULATION

We now investigate the eﬀect of the modiﬁcation of the
electron-electron interaction on the wave function part of
the calculation. For this purpose, we evaluate the eﬃ-
ciency of approximate resolutions of Eq. (5) as follows.
We ﬁrst construct, for each µ, the Hamiltonian ˆH µ us-
ing an accurate potential vµ and compute accurately its
Ψµ
ground-state energy, Eµ =
, at the MRCISD
h
i
level. We then compute various approximate ground-
state energies, Eµ
ˆH µ
, by using approximate
CI-type wave functions Ψµ
S expanded into linear combi-
nations of all the few Slater determinants generated from
small orbital spaces S. The orbitals used are the natural
orbitals of the Coulombic system calculated at the MR-
CISD level. The accuracy of the approximation for Ψµ
S
can be assessed by looking at the diﬀerence between Eµ

and Eµ

The diﬀerences ∆Eµ

S are plotted along the erf and erf-
gau adiabatic connections in Fig. 2 for the He atom with
the orbital spaces S = 1s, S = 1s2s and S = 1s2s2p.
One sees that, in the Coulombic limit µ
, the re-
duction of the orbital space leads to important errors in
the energy. When µ is decreased, i.e. when the interac-
tion is reduced, the errors due to limited orbital spaces
get smaller and smaller. For instance, at µ = 1, using
only the single-determinant wave function Ψµ
1s, leads to
an error ∆Eµ
1s of less than 0.005 Hartree. The erfgau
interaction generally gives smaller errors than the erf in-
teraction, except near µ = 0 where the non-monotonicity
of the erfgau interaction leads to peculiar behaviors [24].
Anyway, we will not use the erfgau interaction in this
region of very small µ.

The case of the Be atom with the orbital spaces S =
1s2s and S = 1s2s2p is reported in Fig. 3. Because of
the near-degeneracy of the 2s and 2p levels, the inclusion
of 2p conﬁgurations in the wave function is important,
quite independently of the electron-electron interaction.
Indeed, the diﬀerence Eµ
1s2s2p remains large for al-
most all µ’s. On the contrary, the error of the calculation
where the 2p orbitals are included, ∆Eµ
1s2s2p, quickly falls
oﬀ when µ is decreased. Again, for µ = 1 for instance,
the error ∆Eµ
1s2s2p given by the few-determinant CI-type
wave function Ψµ

1s2s2p is less than 0.005 Hartree.

Eµ

Therefore, the modiﬁcation of the interaction enables
to increase the accuracy of CI-type wave function cal-
culations, or equivalently for a ﬁxed target accuracy, de-
crease the eﬀort of the calculation by reducing the orbital
space. The crucial point for this eﬀect to appear is the

V. BEHAVIOR OF SHORT-RANGE

FUNCTIONALS WITH RESPECT TO THE
INTERACTION PARAMETER

tional reduces to the standard exchange-correlation func-
tional of the KS scheme, ¯Eµ=0
xc = Exc, and in the limit
, the short-range functional vanishes, ¯Eµ
µ
= 0.

Near these two limits, the study of the behavior of ¯Eµ

and ¯Eµ
c with respect to µ constitutes an analysis of the
exchange and correlation functionals in term of the range
of the interaction. Indeed, the behavior at µ
0 tells
us how the KS exchange-correlation functional responds
when very long-range interactions are removed from it,

The exchange energy with the erf interaction varies lin-
early in µ near the Kohn-Sham end of the adiabatic con-
nection (see Fig. 4). On the contrary, the exchange en-
ergy with the erfgau interaction varies very slowly like µ5
which implies that the corresponding curve is very ﬂat
near µ = 0 (see Fig. 5). The latter behavior is not unex-
pected for a good long-range/short-range separation. In-
deed, with the erfgau interaction, when µ increases near
µ = 0 only very long-range interaction eﬀects are re-
moved from the functional; they practically do not later
the exchange energy of a ﬁnite system. With the erf
interaction, the long-range/short-range separation is im-
perfect and thus the short-range part of the interaction
is also aﬀected near µ = 0 which is responsible for the
linear behavior of the exchange energy in this case. This
clearly shows that the erfgau interaction realizes a bet-
ter separation of long-range and short-range interactions
than the erf interaction.

Similarly, the expansion for the erfgau interaction is

The correlation energy varies much more slowly than the
exchange energy near the KS end of the adiabatic con-
nection. Therefore, the curve of the correlation energy
with respect to µ is very ﬂat around µ = 0 (see Figs. 6
and 7). Again, this is due to the fact that removing very
long-range interactions from the functional has no eﬀect
in a ﬁnite system. It will be seen in Sec VII that this
makes the correlation energy diﬃcult to interpolate near
µ = 0 from a knowledge of the functional for large µ.

Eq. (27) or (28) shows that the ﬁrst term in the expan-
sion for large µ of the short-range exchange energy is an
exact local functional of the density (or, in general, of
the spin-densities). Therefore, the local density approxi-
mation becomes exact in this limit. An alternative view
of this result can be achieved in the framework of the
wave-vector analysis of the usual KS exchange functional

by considering the short wavelength limit [5]. The next
term of expansion (28) involves the gradient of the den-
and the kinetic energy density τ and is therefore
sity
of the meta-GGA type. The following higher-order terms
involve of course more and more ingredients constructed
from higher-order derivatives of the KS orbitals. Note
that instead of considering these spin-dependent quanti-
ties one can also directly use the on-top exchange pair
density and its derivatives.

By carefully comparing Eq. (27) and Eq. (29), one sees

energies cancel out order by order in the expansion with

respect to µ. As the ﬁrst term (in µ−
expansion of the exchange energy is a local functional of
the density, this cancellation is exactly maintained in the
LDA, i.e. there is no self-interaction error in LDA for
this ﬁrst term. For the next term of the expansion (in
4), the removal of the self-interaction error requires
µ−
the consideration of a meta-GGA functional depending
explicitly on

In the KS scheme,

it has been often argued that
(semi)local approximate exchange functionals actually
mimics near-degeneracy correlation eﬀects (see, e.g.,
Ref. 47).
It is clear from this above discussion that,
for short-range exchange functionals, (semi)local approx-
imations become exact at large µ and therefore do not
fortuitously mimic near-degeneracy correlation anymore.

This result show that for large µ the short-range cor-
relation energy becomes an exact local functional of
the on-top pair density n2(r, r) (and of the density via
n2,c(r, r) = n2(r, r)
n(r)n(r)/2 for closed-shell sys-
tems). This emphasizes the importance of this quantity
for density functional approximations. It is in the same
line of thought of a number of previous studies [48, 49, 50]
stressing the need of including explicitly the on-top pair
density in approximate density functionals.

This last expansion is compared with the exact expan-
sion (28) for the He atom with the erf and erfgau interac-
tions in Figs. 4 and 5, respectively. In these expressions,
an accurate density of the He atom is used. The LDA
for the modiﬁed interactions [17, 24] evaluated with the
same density is also reported, as well as an accurate cal-
culation of the exchange energy along the adiabatic con-
nection [26, 53] (see Sec. III). The LDA expansion (33)
is exact for the ﬁrst term and very close to the exact ex-
pansion (28) with the ﬁrst two terms. Consequently, in
the domain of validity of this expansion (for µ & 2), the
LDA is nearly exact. The success of the LDA for large
µ is therefore due to the exactness of the exchange on-
top pair-density and the good transferability of its ﬁrst
derivatives from the uniform electron gas to the ﬁnite
system. Actually, it can be remarked that the expansion
4 term performs even slightly better
of LDA up to the µ−
than the exact expansion to the same order. Similarly,
the LDA is already very accurate for µ & 1 while achiev-
ing a comparable accuracy from the slowly-improving ex-
pansion (28) of the exact exchange energy would require
a rather long expansion.

abatic connection [26, 53] and the LDA for modiﬁed in-
teractions [17, 24] are also reported. As for the exchange
energy, the ﬁrst terms of the LDA expansion (34) nearly
coincide with the exact expansion. This expansion with
the ﬁrst two terms gives a very accurate approximation
to the exact correlation energy in the region of accuracy
of the full LDA curve (from µ
). From
these results, it is clear that the total on-top pair density
n2(r, r) have good transferability from the uniform elec-
tron gas to the He atom. Actually, this good (while not
exact) transferability seems quite general and has already
been pointed out for several atomic and molecular sys-
tems [50, 54, 55]. This gives an explanation for the suc-
cess of the LDA in treating short-range electron-electron
interactions (large µ). On the contrary, toward the Kohn-
Sham end (µ = 0) of the adiabatic connection, the LDA
transfers spurious long-range correlations from the uni-
form electron gas and therefore poorly extrapolates the
exact correlation energy of the ﬁnite system which does
not contain these long-range correlation eﬀects.

INTERPOLATIONS FOR THE
SHORT-RANGE EXCHANGE AND
CORRELATION FUNCTIONALS

In the previous section, we have shown that the LDA
treats successfully short-range interactions correspond-
ing to large interaction parameters µ but is inaccurate
toward the KS end of the adiabatic connection, i.e. for
small µ. But for µ = 0 a lot of better estimates of the
exchange and correlation energies are available with den-
sity functional approximations of the KS scheme which go

beyond the LDA such as gradient-corrected functionals.
A simple idea for improving the short-range exchange-
correlation energy functional along the adiabatic connec-
tion is therefore to interpolate between an available den-
sity functional approximation (DFA) for µ = 0 and the
µ-dependent LDA for µ
. In the spirit of the usual

DFT approximations, this interpolation will be done lo-
cally, i.e. for the short-range exchange-correlation energy

A. Rational interpolations

A simple possibility is to interpolate ¯εµ

xc(r) along the
adiabatic connection using an estimate at µ = 0 and
the expansions for large µ (and eventually for small µ)
presented in Sec. V. For example, consider the rational
approximant for the short-range exchange energy density

estimated by one of the usual density functional approx-
imations of the KS scheme.

LDA exchange energy for µ
realized in Sec. VI that the LDA works well on a larger
domain of µ than the ﬁrst terms of its asymptotic expan-
sion. In order to take better advantage of the LDA, one
can modify it only in the region of small µ by using infor-
mation from better estimates of the KS exchange energy
at µ = 0. We therefore interpolate locally the short-range
exchange density along the adiabatic connection by

where w(µ) is a weight function acting at small µ only.
More precisely, w(µ) must be a positive function satisfy-
ing w(µ = 0) = 1 so that ¯εµ=0
, having signiﬁcant
values in the region where the LDA fails and with a fast
decay for µ
so as to recover the correct behavior
of ¯εµ,unif
for large µ. For the erf interaction, we found
x
that the local value of µ delimiting the domain where
the LDA is inaccurate is well estimated by 1/rs(r) where
rs(r) is the local Wigner-Seitz radius. We therefore take
werf (µ) = erfc(µrs) where the complementary error func-
tion erfc ensures that the weight function has signiﬁcant
values only for µ < 1/rs. Eq. (40) thus interpolates be-
tween εDFA
at µ = 0 and the LDA at large µ.
For the erfgau interaction, we can used the same weight
function except that now the local value of µ delimiting
the domain where the LDA must be corrected is esti-
mated by µ = c/rs where c =
3.375 is
the scale factor between the erf and erfgau interactions
discussed in Sec. II. We therefore take as weight function
werfgau(µ) = erfc(µrs/c).

tional approximants give an overall reasonable estimate
of the exchange energy along both adiabatic connections
but are actually less accurate that the LDA in the re-
gion of intermediate µ. As already noticed, this reﬂects
the fact that the LDA works well on a larger range of
µ that the ﬁrst terms of its expansion for µ

weighted interpolations make better use of the LDA and
constitutes an improvement over it for all µ’s. Finally,
the approximation of Iikura et al. is nearly identical to
the weighted interpolation for both the erf and erfgau
interactions.

Similar curves for the short-range correlation energy
of the He atom with the erf and erfgau interactions are
shown in Figs. 10 and 11. As for the exchange energy,
the rational approximants constitute an overall correc-
tion to the LDA but not in a systematic way since the
LDA still performs better for intermediate µ. On the
contrary, the weighted interpolations always improve the
LDA. As one can expect, considering exchange and cor-
relation together further improves the results at small µ.
We now discuss the Be atom. The short-range ex-
change energy along the adiabatic connections looks very
similar to that of the He atom and will not be shown.
The short-range correlation energy for which the LDA
has more diﬃculties than for the He case is represented
in Figs. 12 and 13 for the erf and erfgau interactions.
One can see that both the rational approximant and the

The He and Be atoms are simple cases where a
gradient-corrected functional like PBE give a very accu-
rate correlation energy. On the contrary, the Ne6+ atom
constitutes a much more diﬃcult system for (semi)local
functionals because of the presence of strong near-
degeneracy correlation eﬀects due to the proximity of the
2s and 2p levels. The short-range correlation energy of
this system is reported in Figs. 14 and 15 for the erf
and erfgau interactions. The PBE functional of the KS
scheme (µ = 0) strongly underestimates the correlation
energy. One sees that with the rational approximants or
the weighted interpolations, the error is rapidly decreased
when µ is increased, i.e. when long-range interactions are
removed from the functional.

VIII. CONCLUSION

In a quantum electronic system, the long-range/short-
range separation of the Coulomb interaction enables to
rigorously decompose the total energy into long-range
and short-range components which can be calculated by
diﬀerent methods. In particular, a density functional ap-
proximation can be used for the short-range part of the
energy, while the long-range contribution can be treated
by traditional wave function methods. In this work, we
have considered two possible long-range/short-range sep-
aration of the Coulomb interaction: the erf and erfgau
modiﬁed interactions. The erfgau interaction achieves
a better separation than the erf interaction. We have
shown that the use of these modiﬁed interactions facil-
itates wave function calculations. We have also studied
the short-range part of the exchange-correlation func-
tional with respect to the range of the associated inter-
action, and shown that, in the limit of a very short-range

interaction, the exchange contribution to this functional
can be expressed as a local functional of the density and is
therefore exact in the LDA. In the same limit, the correla-
tion contribution can be expressed as a local functional of
the on-top pair density which is generally accurate in the
LDA. However, when the interaction becomes more and
more long-ranged, the LDA is inaccurate. It is neverthe-
less possible to improve the LDA description of the short-
range exchange-correlation functional by making use of
the available gradient-corrected functional of the Kohn-
Sham scheme in the limit of the full Coulomb interac-
tion. We have indeed proposed two kind of interpola-
tions for the short-range exchange-correlation functional
along the erf or erfgau adiabatic connection which im-

12

prove the LDA. In order to extend the interaction range
well treated by functional approximations in a more sys-
tematic way, we are currently investigating gradient cor-
rections for the short-range exchange-correlation func-
tional.

APPENDIX A: MODIFIED TWO-ELECTRON INTEGRALS

In this Appendix, we give details of the evaluation of the two-electron integrals over Gaussian basis sets for the
modiﬁed erf and erfgau interactions. The modiﬁed integrals have been implemented into the Seward program [57]
available in the Molpro package [44] and using the Rys quadrature scheme [58]. For other implementations of two-
electron integrals with modiﬁed interactions, see Refs. 28, 36, 59.

The general form of four-center two-electron integrals is

taking the functional derivatives of the expansions of the
short-range Hartree, exchange and correlation energies
(Eqs. B3, B4 and B9) to obtain the expansion of the

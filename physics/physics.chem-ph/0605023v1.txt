We analyze a decomposition of the Coulomb electron-electron interaction into a long-range and
a short-range part in the framework of density functional theory, deriving some scaling relations
and the corresponding virial theorem. We study the behavior of the local density approximation in
the high-density limit for the long-range and the short-range functionals by carrying out a detailed
analysis of the correlation energy of a uniform electron gas interacting via a long-range only electron-
electron repulsion. Possible deﬁnitions of exchange and correlation energy densities are discussed
and clariﬁed with some examples.

I.

INTRODUCTION

In recent years, there has been a growing interest in ap-
proaches of density functional theory (DFT) [1] based on
a long-range/short-range decomposition of the Coulomb
electron-electron interaction (see, e.g., Refs. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6).
The idea is to use diﬀerent, appropriate approximations
for the long-range and the short-range contributions to
the usual density functionals of the Kohn-Sham (KS)
scheme [7].

In this paper, we

consider one possible

long-
range/short-range decomposition of the Coulombic den-
sity functionals. To gain insight into the introduced long-
range and short-range density functionals, we examine
some scaling relations, the virial theorem and energy den-
sities. The local density approximation (LDA) appropri-
ately deﬁned for these functionals is also analyzed.

The long-range and short-range density functionals
considered in this work are deﬁned as follows (see also
Refs. 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13). The starting point is the
decomposition of the electron-electron Coulomb interac-
tion wee(r) = 1/r as

(1)

ee (r),

ee (r) + wsr,µ

wee(r) = wlr,µ
with the long-range interaction wlr,µ
and the complement short-range part wsr,µ
−
erf(µr)/r. The parameter µ controls the range of the de-
composition. For µ = 0 the long-range interaction van-
ishes, wlr,µ=0
it reduces to the
Coulomb interaction, wlr,µ
(r) = 1/r. The Coulombic

posed as

ine some scaling properties of the long-range and short-
range functionals, and we discuss the high-density limit
of the correlation functionals in LDA. In Sec. III, we de-
rive the virial theorem satisﬁed by the long-range and
short-range functionals.
In Sec. IV, we examine long-
range and short-range energy densities. Sec. V contains
our conclusions.

All the relations derived in this work are more gener-
ally true for an interaction of the form wlr,µ
ee (r) = β(µr)/r
where β is a continuous and diﬀerentiable function satis-
fying β(x

II. SCALING RELATIONS

In this section, we generalize some usual scaling rela-
tions of the Coulombic density functionals [16, 17] (see
also Ref. 18) to the case of the long-range and short-
range density functionals. The scaled wave function of
a N -electron system corresponding to a uniform scaling
of the electron coordinates by the scale factor γ > 0 is
deﬁned by (see, e.g., Refs. 16, 19, 20, 21)

The wave function Ψγ yields the scaled density nγ

nγ(r) = γ3n(γr).

A. Scaling relation for the Hartree and exchange
functionals

It can be easily veriﬁed from Eq. (5) that the long-
range Hartree functional satisﬁes the following scaling
relation

Elr,µγ
H

[nγ] = γElr,µ

H [n].

(14)

The KS determinant associated to the scaled density nγ is
identical to the KS determinant associated to the density
n after uniform scaling of the coordinates

It is interesting to study how the long-range and short-
range LDA functionals behave in the high-density limit,
and to understand whether they can overcome some
of the well-known problems of standard LDA in this
regime (see, e.g., [25]). For the uniform electron gas of
density n, the scaling transformation of Eq. (13) is sim-
1/3 is the
ply written as rs →
Wigner-Seitz radius. The correlation energy per particle
of the Coulombic electron gas diverges in the high-density
limit logarithmically [26]

ing for systems with a non-degenerate ground state [25].
The origin of the divergence of Eq. (26) has been widely
analyzed in terms of the electron-gas pair density, both
[27, 28, 29]),
in real and reciprocal space (see, e.g.,
and, more recently, in terms of the momentum distri-
bution [30].

The investigation of the γ

performances of the
long- and short-range LDA functionals implies the study
of the high-density behavior of the correlation energy of
an electron gas interacting with wlr,µ
ee . Following Refs. 27,
28, we consider for this “long-range” electron gas the
Fourier transform of the pair density, the static structure
factor Slr,µ(k, rs). The correlation energy per particle,

For the Coulomb gas, the random-phase approxima-

0 (see, e.g.,
the exact correlation energy when rs →

of the Coulombic gas (which corresponds to µ =

Eq. (29) gives a static structure factor which behaves like
1/q for small q, thus yielding the logarithmic divergence

The short-range correlation energy per particle of the
uniform electron gas is just the diﬀerence between the
correlation energies of the Coulomb gas and of the “long-

mic term occurs if we rescale µ,

The function h(µ, rs) remains ﬁnite as long as µrs is

LDA performances in the high-density limit by rescaling
1/rs(r), or globally by choosing a µ

rs(r) in the given system. In other words, the rescaled
short-range functional allows to perform a cut-oﬀ of the

eliminate the long-range correlations that occur in an
electron gas but that do not occur in a conﬁned system.

IV. ENERGY DENSITIES

In this section, we examine long-range and short-range
energy densities deﬁned from pair densities or from the
virial theorem. Energy densities are always useful to an-
alyze approximations or derive new approximations (see,
e.g., Refs. 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40).

A. Energy densities from pair densities

In Ref. 41, energy densities for modiﬁed interactions
deﬁned from pair densities have been discussed. We re-
call that an energy density associated to the long-range
exchange energy Elr,µ

can be deﬁned by

x

2 Z

2 Z

where n2,x(r, r12) is the KS exchange pair density. Like-
wise, the corresponding short-range energy density writes

esr,µ
x,pd(r) =

n2,x(r, r12)wsr,µ

ee (r12)dr12.

(46)

The deﬁnition of correlation energy densities from pair
densities requires an integration over an adiabatic con-
nection. For instance, an energy density associated to
the long-range correlation functional Elr,µ
can be writ-
ten as

These energy densities involves two-electron quantities

that can complicate their evaluation.

B. Energy densities from the virial theorem

Long-range and short-range energy densities can be de-
ﬁned from the virial theorem, just as for the Coulom-
bic case (see, e.g., Refs. 34, 38). The virial relation
of Eq. (40) leads indeed to the following long-range ex-
change energy density

C. Results on the He atom

x,pd(r), elr,µ

As a simple illustration, we have calculated for the
He atom the long-range and short-range energy densities
elr,µ
x,vir(r) and esr,µ
x,pd(r), esr,µ
x,vir(r) for µ = 1 a.u.,
as well as the Coulombic energies densities ex,pd(r) =
x,pd(r) + esr,µ
elr,µ
x,vir(r).
For a two-electron system, the exchange pair density and
exchange potentials are directly deducible from the den-
sity. Using an accurate density, accurate exchange energy
densities are thus easily obtained.

Fig. 2 compares the accurate and LDA radial exchange
energy densities as a function of the distance to the nu-
cleus r. One sees that the energy densities deﬁned from
the exchange pair density and from the virial theorem
are qualitatively similar. At small r (r . 0.5 a.u.), the
LDA slightly overestimates the accurate Coulombic en-
ergy densities. At large r (r & 0.5 a.u.), the LDA im-
portantly underestimates the accurate Coulombic energy

both the accurate and LDA exchange holes are centered
at r12 = 0, making the LDA a reasonable approximation.
For r = 1 a.u., the accurate hole is centered near r12 = 1
a.u. while the LDA hole is still centered at r12 = 0,
leading to an important underestimation of the hole.

tant in the long-range energy densities while it is signiﬁ-
cantly reduced in the short-range energy densities. Con-
sequently, the LDA better performs for the short-range
energy densities.

In the case of the energy density deﬁned from the ex-
change pair density, the better performance of the LDA
at small distance r can be easily explained in term of
the spherical average of the exchange hole nx(r, r12) =

We have analyzed a short-range and long-range decom-
position of the Coulomb electron-electron interaction and
we have derived some exact scaling relations for the corre-
sponding density functionals. The study of the LDA ap-
proximation has shown that in the high-density limit the
short-range functional scales to a constant, thus opening
the possibility of ameliorating the performances of the
Coulomb LDA functional in this regime. Possible deﬁni-
tions of energy densities obtained from pair densities and
from the virial theorem have been presented. Results on
the He atom suggest that the LDA approximation can
give accurate short-range exchange energy densities.

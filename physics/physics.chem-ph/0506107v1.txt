We report microscopic calculations of free energies and entropies for intramolecular electron trans-
fer reactions. The calculation algorithm combines the atomistic geometry and charge distribution of
a molecular solute obtained from quantum calculations with the microscopic polarization response
of a polar solvent expressed in terms of its polarization structure factors. The procedure is tested
on a donor-acceptor complex in which ruthenium donor and cobalt acceptor sites are linked by a
four-proline polypeptide. The reorganization energies and reaction energy gaps are calculated as
a function of temperature by using structure factors obtained from our analytical procedure and
from computer simulations. Good agreement between two procedures and with direct computer
simulations of the reorganization energy is achieved. The microscopic algorithm is compared to
the dielectric continuum calculations. We found that the strong dependence of the reorganization
energy on the solvent refractive index predicted by continuum models is not supported by the mi-
croscopic theory. Also, the reorganization and overall solvation entropies are substantially larger in
the microscopic theory compared to continuum models.

INTRODUCTION

Beginning with work of Marcus on electron transfer
(ET) between ions dissolved in polar solvents [1], the
understanding of the dynamics and thermodynamics of
the nuclear polarization coupled to the transferred elec-
tron has been viewed as a key component of ET theo-
ries. The concept of polarization ﬂuctuations as a major
mechanism driving ET has been extended over the sev-
eral decades of research from simple molecular solvents
to a diversity of condensed-phase media of varying com-
plexity. A signiﬁcant part of the present experimental
and theoretical eﬀort is directed toward the understand-
ing of ET in biology, where this process is a key com-
ponent of energy transport chains [2, 3, 4, 5]. Biological
systems pose a major challenge to theoretical and compu-
tational chemistry from at least two viewpoints. First,
the solvent, including bulk and bound water [6], mem-
branes, and parts of the polar and polarizable matrix of
the biopolymer, is highly anisotropic and heterogeneous.
Second, the geometry of what can be separated as a so-
lute is often very complex, including concave regions of
molecular scale occupied by the solvent and regions of
the biopolymer with a signiﬁcant mobility of polar and
ionizable residues.

Dielectric continuum models accommodate the com-
plex solute shape by numerical algorithms solving the
Poisson equation with the boundary conditions deﬁned
by a dielectric cavity [7]. The heterogeneous nature of
the solvent in the vicinity of a redox site can in principle

∗E-mail:dmitrym@asu.edu.
†E-mail:newton@bnl.gov

be included by assigning diﬀerent dielectric constants to
its heterogeneous parts [8]. Two fundamental problems
inevitably arise in this algorithm. The ﬁrst has been
well recognized over the years of its application and is
related to the ambiguity of deﬁning the dielectric cav-
ity for molecular solutes. This problem is often resolved
by proper parameterization of the radii of atomic and
molecular groups of the solute. The second problem is
much less studied. It is related to the fact that collective
polarization ﬂuctuations of molecular dielectrics possess
a ﬁnite correlation length which may be comparable to
the length of concave regions of the solute or some other
characteristic dimensions signiﬁcant for solvation ther-
modynamics. The deﬁnition of the dielectric constant
for polar regions of molecular length is very ambiguous
and, in addition, once the dielectric constant is deﬁned,
it is not clear if the dielectric response can fully develop
on the molecular length scale.

In addition to the problems in implementing the con-
tinuum formalism for molecular solutes there are some
fundamental limitations of the continuum approximation
itself that may limit its applicability to solvation and
electron transfer thermodynamics. On the basic level,
the deﬁnition of the molecular cavity should be re-done
for each particular thermodynamic state of the solvent
[9, 10] and/or electronic state of the solute [11]. This pre-
cludes the use of continuum theories with a given cavity
parametrization to describe derivatives of the solvation
free energy, e.g. entropy and volume of solvation [12]. In
addition, the calculation of the free energy of ET acti-
vation requires a proper separation of nuclear solvation
from the overall solvent response. This problem, actively
studied by formal theories in the past [13, 14, 15, 16],
has been recently addressed by computer simulations
[17, 18, 19]. Computer simulations have indicated that

continuum recipes for the separation of nuclear and elec-
tronic polarization are unreliable, resulting in too strong
a dependence of the solvent reorganization (free) energy
on solvent refractive index. All these limitations call
for an extension of traditional approaches to solvation
and ET thermodynamics that would include microscopic
length-scales of solvent polarization.

Microscopic theories of solvation are not yet suﬃciently
developed to compete eﬃciently with continuum models
in application to solvation of biopolymers. Computer
simulations provide a very detailed picture of the local
solvation structure, but their application to solvation of
large solutes requires very lengthy computations and of-
ten includes approximations that are hard to control. In
particular, the dielectric response is very slowly converg-
ing in simulations and is potentially aﬀected by approx-
imations made to describe the long-range electrostatic
forces. Several simulation protocols in which polariza-
tion response is (partially) integrated out by analytical
techniques have been proposed [20, 21]. Integral equation
theories have been successfully applied to small solutes
[22], but examples of their application to solvation and
reactivity of large solutes are just a few [23]. The formu-
lation of the solvation problem in terms of molecular re-
sponse functions holds signiﬁcant promise, as it combines
the molecular length scale of the polarization response
with a possibility to accommodate an arbitrary shape of
the solute [24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34].
A recent re-formulation of the Gaussian model [28] for
solvation in polar solvents [35, 36] shows a good agree-
ment with simulations of model systems and an abil-
ity to conform with experiment when applied to ET
in biomolecules [37] and charge-transfer complexes [38]
and to solvation dynamics [39]. Testing the algorithm,
referred to as the non-local response function theory
(NRFT), on model systems for which both computer sim-
ulations and experiment exist is critical for future appli-
cations to more complex systems. This is the aim of the
present contribution.

(DSA) complex referred to as complex 1 in the text.

Testing microscopic solvation theories requires com-
parison to computer simulations on model, yet realis-
tic, systems. The current experimental database does
not provide suﬃcient accuracy to test various approxima-
tions entering theoretical algorithms. On the other hand,

computer experiment oﬀers essentially exact (within the
accuracy of simulation protocols) integration of the same
Hamiltonian as the one used in the analytical theory.
Therefore, the present calculations of the ET thermody-
namics are compared to recent very extensive Molecu-
lar Dynamics (MD) simulations [40] of a donor-spacer-
acceptor (DSA) complex consisting of transition-metal
donor (D) and acceptor (A) sites linked by a polyproline
peptide spacer (S) (Fig. 1):

where in the donor bpy=2,2′-bipyridine and bpy′=4′-
methyl-2,2′-bipyridyl. The spacer is a polyproline chain
whose ﬁrst member (the N-terminus) is connected to the
bpy′ carbonyl, and whose fourth member is terminated
Co3+(NH3)5 ac-
by a carboxylate moiety bound to the
ceptor. This system, modeling ET in redox proteins, is
a representative member of a homologous series of DSA
complexes for which ET rates as a function of tempera-
ture have been reported [41]. This complex will be re-
ferred to as complex 1 in the text.

−

The analytical NRFT model is shown to agree excep-
tionally well with MD simulations for complex 1 (Figure
1) in TIP3P water. In order to provide a rigorous com-
parison between simulations and analytical theory, the
set of solute charges employed in the simulations was
also used in the analytical calculations. In addition, the
polarization structure factors of TIP3P water were ob-
tained from separate MD simulations to be used as input
in the analytical theory. Once the accuracy and robust-
ness of the analytical procedures are tested on MD sim-
ulations, the next step is to see if the model is capable
of reﬂecting the behavior of real systems. To this end,
we have developed a parameterization scheme for polar-
ization structure factors applicable to polarizable polar
solvents. Once this is done, the theory can be extended
to calculations at varying thermodynamic conditions of
the solvent (e.g., temperature) and should generate a set
of predictions which can be tested experimentally.

We use the polypeptide DSA to focus on two prob-
lematic areas of dielectric continuum models: depen-
dence of the reorganization energy on the solvent po-
larizability [17, 19] and the entropy of nuclear solva-
tion [12, 29]. For both areas there is a fundamen-
tal, both quantitative and qualitative, disagreement be-
tween microscopic models and continuum calculations.
Unfortunately, no experimental evidence on the depen-
dence of the solvent reorganization energy on solvent re-
fractive index is available in the literature. There is,
on the other hand, a limited number of experimental
[12, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51] and simula-
tion [52] studies on the entropy of reorganization. Most
of the available experimental (laboratory and simulation)
evidence points to a positive reorganization entropy (i.e.,
a negative slope of the reorganization energy vs tempera-
ture) in polar solvents, in agreement with the prediction
of microscopic theory [29] and in disagreement with neg-
ative entropies from continuum calculations [12, 53]. We

are aware, however, of a few measurements performed on
charged donor-acceptor complexes indicating either zero
or negative reorganization entropies [42, 48, 49]. Our
current calculations on complex 1 (Fig. 1) give absolute
values of the reorganization entropy much higher than
continuum calculations. This great discrepancy calls for
additional tests of the theory against experimental data,
which will be a subject of future work.

III. SOLVATION THERMODYNAMICS

Inserting a solute into a molecular solvent results in
solvent perturbation that can roughly be split into two
components with drastically diﬀerent length scales. The
ﬁrst component is due to repulsion of the solvent from
the solute core caused by short-range, but strong re-
pulsive forces. This perturbation creates a local den-
sity proﬁle in the solvent around the solute which may
or may not induce a polarization ﬁeld acting on the so-
lute charges. The electric ﬁeld of solute charges creates
yet another perturbation. The solute electric ﬁeld is suf-
ﬁciently long-ranged to induce the dipolar polarization
P(r) in a quasi-macroscopic region of the solvent around
the solute. Gradients of the solute ﬁeld couple to the
higher-order (quadrupolar, etc.) polarization, but this
interaction is more short-ranged [38, 65, 66, 67].

The dipolar polarization is caused by alignment of the
permanent and induced solvent dipoles along the solute
ﬁeld. This alignment occurs on two quite diﬀerent time
10−12
scales:
s for permanent dipoles. Accordingly, the polarization
ﬁeld splits into a fast relaxing electronic polarization (in-
duced dipoles, Pe) and a much slower nuclear polariza-
tion (permanent dipoles, Pn) [68]. The electronic sol-
vent polarization is always in equilibrium with the chang-
ing distribution of the electronic density in the donor-
acceptor complex. The energy conservation condition of
the Golden Rule formula is thus imposed on the energies
with equilibrated electronic polarization. Therefore, be-
fore being used in the Golden Rule expression, the Hamil-
tonian matrix should be averaged over the fast electronic
component of the dipolar polarization [15, 69]. For the
energy Ei depending on the instantaneous conﬁguration
of the nuclear subsystem one gets

function: as polarization response to an external electric ﬁeld
perturbation (a) and as correlation of polarization ﬂuctua-
tions near the solute hard core from which the polarization
ﬁeld is excluded (b).

A. Formalism

In the linear response approximation (LRA), the sol-
vent polarization P(r) is a linear functional of the per-
turbing electric ﬁeld E0 (vacuum electric ﬁeld of the so-
lute for solvation):

P(r) = χ

E0 =

χ(r, r′)

E0(r′)dr′.

(24)

∗

Z

·

Here, χ(r, r′) is a two-rank tensor describing the non-
local linear response of the solvent to the solute electric
ﬁeld, dot denotes tensor contraction over the common
Cartesian projections. This function is diﬀerent from di-
electric susceptibility appearing in Maxwell’s equations
in two respects. First, χ(r, r′) describes the polarization
response to the ﬁeld of external charges and not to the
total electric ﬁeld E = E0 + EP combining the exter-
nal ﬁeld with the electric ﬁeld EP created by the solvent
polarization (χ corresponds to χ0 of Madden and Kivel-
son [70]). Second, χ(r, r′) is aﬀected by the presence
of the solute and thus χ(r1, r′) is generally not equal to
r′ = r2 −
χ(r2, r′′) even if r1 −
Equation (24) determines the response function in
terms of an external electrostatic perturbation and polar-
ization induced by it (Fig. 2a). An alternative view of the
response function is through the ﬂuctuation-dissipation
theorem which relates the response to the correlation
function of polarization ﬂuctuations in the solute vicinity

r′′.

An important result of the LRA is that this correlation
function does not depend on the long-range electrostatic
ﬁeld of the solute. The ensemble average

equivalent to the ensemble average
i0 in the presence
of a ﬁctitious solute which has the geometry of the real
solute (and therefore the complete repulsion potential)
but no partial charges. This notion provides a conve-
nient route to the calculations of the response function
for complex solutes.
Instead of calculating the polar-
ization in response to a non-trivial ﬁeld E0(r), one can
calculate the correlation of polarization ﬂuctuations in
the presence of a ﬁctitious solute with only the hard re-
pulsive core of the real solute retained. The correlation
function is then calculated with the requirement of zero
polarization within the solute (Fig. 2b)

This is the essence of the approach adopted in the present
formalism, making the response function solely deter-
mined by the molecular structure inherent to the pure

the repulsive core of the solute.

The applicability of the LRA to solvation of large
donor-acceptor complexes common for ET research in
molecular solvents is well supported by existing evidence
from computer simulations [71, 72, 73, 74, 75]. The di-
rect consequence of the LRA are the following relations

The inhomogeneous character of the response functions
is retained after transformation to k-space. The function
χ(k, k′) then depends on two wavevectors in contrast to
the dependence on a single wave-vector for the homoge-
neous dielectric response. The calculation of χ(k, k′) is
still a major challenge for microscopic theories of polar
solvation. Despite some very active research in this area
for the last 80 years since the formulation of the Born
model for solvation of spherical ions [76], no microscopic
solution applicable to solutes of arbitrary shape has been
presented so far. A promising strategy, adopted already
in the Born [76] and Onsager [77] models, is to calculate
the response functions in terms of properties of the pure
solvent. This connection can be achieved by considering
the polarization correlation function in the presence of
the repulsive core of the solute [Eq. (26)].

The exclusion of the polarization ﬁeld from the solute
volume is provided by the Li-Kardar-Chandler approach
[28, 78], in which the trajectories deﬁning the response
function in its path integral representation are restricted
from entering the solute. The result of this procedure
is an integral equation relating χ(k, k′) to the non-local
susceptibility of the pure solvent χs(k) (with a single
k-vector for the homogeneous response) and the shape
of the solute. The equation for the response function
is then equivalent to the Ornstein-Zernike equation for
the solute-solvent correlation function with the Percus-
Yevick closure for the solute-solvent direct correlation
function [28].

No general solution for χ(k, k′) in the Li-Kardar-
Chandler integral equation has been obtained so far.
One can, however, employ analytical properties of the
response functions to obtain the solvation chemical po-
tential [35]

The closed-form result for µ0s exists when the Fourier
transform of the electric ﬁeld ˜E0(k) is known in analyt-
ical functional form. This is not the case for many real
problems, when the distribution of molecular charge is
given from force ﬁelds or quantum calculations and the
Fourier transform of the ﬁeld is calculated numerically.
Unfortunately, the analytical solution is given by the dif-
ference of two large numbers almost canceling each other.
It therefore becomes not very practical in strongly polar
solvents because of accumulation of numerical errors. To
facilitate numerical applications, a mean-ﬁeld solution for
χ(k, k′) was oﬀered in Ref. 36. This solution eliminates
the inhomogeneous character of the response function by

The mean-ﬁeld approximation adopted in deriving

uniform ﬁeld of the solvent within the solute by its spatial
average F0 [Eq. (30)]. The neglect of the gradients of the
ﬁeld induced by the solvent within the solute amounts to
taking the dipolar projection of the solute ﬁeld according
to the following relation:

is the dipolar tensor. The electric ﬁeld F0 is a gener-
alization of the Onsager reaction ﬁeld for the case of
non-spherical solutes with non-dipolar charge distribu-
tion. F0 reduces to the Onsager ﬁeld for spherical dipolar
solutes.

The mean-ﬁeld renormalization of the transverse com-
ponent of the response function in Eq. (30) resolves the
fundamental diﬃculty of microscopic solvation theories
arising from the fact that the short-range repulsive per-
turbation caused by the solute produces a major change

in the polarization response functions compared to those
of the pure solvent. For instance, a direct replacement
of χ(k) with χs(k) in the homogeneous approximation
(see Ref. 79 for discussion) results in divergent behavior
of λs with increasing solvent dipole moment [80]. The
divergence arises from the transverse component of the
response (“transverse catastrophe”) which has to be in-
cluded once the dielectric cavity does not coincide with
an equipotential surface of the solute charge distribution
[81]. In continuum calculations, the divergent behavior
is eliminated by imposing boundary conditions at the di-
electric cavity on the solution of the Poisson equation.

Although the problem with the transverse response
has long been recognized in the literature [80, 81, 82],
many microscopic formulations of solvation thermody-
namics and dynamics have avoided the problem by ne-
glecting the transverse response [26, 83, 84] which is also
neglected in some continuum calculations, e.g. the Gen-
eralized Born approximation [85]. Equations (29)–(33)
provide a general solution of the problem which agrees
well with available simulations of polar solvation [35, 36]
and experiment on solvation dynamics [39]. The formal-
ism is based on the homogeneous solvent susceptibility
as input and, once the susceptibility is deﬁned from com-
puter experiment or liquid-state theories, can be applied
to solvation in an arbitrary isotropic dielectric.

B. Polarization structure factors

The dipole moment at a given molecule j in a polar-
polarizable solvent is a sum of the permanent dipole mj
and the induced dipole pj

µj = mj + pj.

induced by the

reaction ﬁeld (superscript “R”) caused by the dipole mj
itself (Fig. 4):

pj = p0

The reaction ﬁeld caused by the dipole mj relaxes on the
time-scale of translational-rotational motion of molecule
j. Therefore, the induced dipole pR
j , which follows adi-
abatically the reaction ﬁeld, should be attributed [86]
to the slow nuclear polarization of the solvent Pn.
In
contrast, the component p0
j , following adiabatically the
external ﬁeld, is attributed to the the fast solvent polar-
ization Pe. The sum of the permanent dipole mj and the
induced dipole pR
j makes the eﬀective condensed-phase
dipole [87]

m′

j = mj + pR

j = m′ˆej,

(38)

where ˆej is the unit vector along the direction of mj.
The dipole moment m′ in principle depends on the in-
stantaneous conﬁguration of the liquid. However, we will
not consider ﬂuctuations of m′ here and, following self-
consistent models of polarizable liquids [87], will replace
m′ with its statistical average value.

The attribution of the electronic polarization in equi-
librium with the electric ﬁeld of the permanent dipoles
to the nuclear (slow) polarization of the solvent is an
essential part of the Pekar partitioning of the solvent po-
larization into fast and slow components [88, 89]. Other
partitioning schemes have been proposed [90], but they
all lead to the same value of the solvation energy when
correctly implemented [91]. Computer simulation proto-
cols in which the induced polarization is self-consistently
adjusted to the instantaneous nuclear conﬁguration pro-
vide direct access to the slow polarization in Pekar’s deﬁ-
nition [92]. Self-consistent simulations of polarizable sol-
vents are used here to test the analytical procedure em-
ployed for the response functions of the nuclear polariza-
tion (Sec. IV A).

The total dipolar response function of the homoge-
neous solvent is a 2-rank tensor describing correlations
of dipole moments µj:

(40)

It is convenient to factor the response function into the
eﬀective density of dipoles yeﬀ, which is mostly aﬀected
by the magnitude of the solvent dipole, and the struc-
ture factor, which reﬂects dipolar correlations and can
be expressed through angular projections of the pair dis-
tribution function [36]

This limit is the result of the point multipole approxi-

the solvent molecules. In contrast, charge-charge struc-
ture factors deﬁned on interaction-site models of liquids
(Refs. 22, 65, 94). The re-
decay to zero at k
gion of k-values where this distinction becomes important
is, however, insigniﬁcant for the calculation of solvation
thermodynamics (see below). The nuclear and the total
structure factors diﬀer in the range of small k-values and
around the longitudinal peak as a result of the inﬂuence
of the high-frequency dielectric constant of the solvent
(Fig. 5). The eﬀect of ǫ∞ on the longitudinal peak is
insigniﬁcant for the calculation of the reorganization en-
ergy. Therefore, it is the range of small k-values and, in
addition, the dependence of the liquid-state dipole mo-
ment m′ on the solvent polarizability, that ultimately
determine the variation of the solvent reorganization en-
ergy with the solvent high-frequency dielectric constant
ǫ∞ (see below).

nent of the free energy gap. They are deﬁned in terms of

The formalism outlined above is realized in a compu-
tational algorithm sketched in Figure 6. It includes two
branches, one is for the solvent part of the calculation and
another is for the solute part. The two parts are com-
bined together in the integration over the inverted space,
which yields the reorganization energy (λs) and the to-
tal free energy of nuclear plus electronic solvation (∆Gs).
We start with describing the solvent branch followed by
the outline of the solute part.

A. Solvent

The calculation of the structure factors in the sol-
vent branch in Fig. 6 requires a set of experimental in-
put parameters: m (gas-phase dipole moment), α (gas-
phase dipolar polarizability), ǫ∞ (high-frequency dielec-
tric constant), ǫs (static dielectric constant), and σ (ef-
fective hard sphere diameter of the solvent molecules).
The hard sphere diameter is obtained from the exper-
imental compressibility of the solvent by ﬁtting it to
the compressibility found from the generalized van der
Waals (vdW) equation of state [95]. Based on these
parameters, an analytical procedure has been recently
proposed to calculate SL,T (k) [36]. This parameteriza-
tion, called parametrized polarization structure factors

For a ﬂuid of hard sphere molecules, η = (π/6)ρσ3 is
the packing density, equal to the ratio of the volume of
the solvent molecules to the volume of the liquid. In the
MSA, the SL,T (k) are obtained by setting η = 2ξ for
SL(k) and η =
ξ for ST (k) in Eq. (65). Here, ξ is the
MSA polarity parameter which can be related either to
the dipolar density yeﬀ or to the static dielectric constant
ǫs [96].

−

Two problems arise when dealing with the reorganiza-
tion energy calculations using the polarization structure
factors from the MSA. First, one needs a general proce-
dure which would provide the nuclear structure factors
SL,T
n (k) in polarizable solvents in contrast to total struc-
ture factors SL,T (k) given by the MSA solution. Such a
formalism should thus exclude (quantum) ﬂuctuations of
the induced solvent dipoles p0
j which are not included in
the nuclear polarization ﬁeld (Fig. 4). Second, the MSA
does not give a consistent description of the dielectric
properties of polar solvents, i.e. the polarity parameters ξ
calculated from yeﬀ and ǫs are quite diﬀerent. The PPSF
procedure goes around the second problem by consider-
ing yeﬀ and ǫs as two independent input parameters used
to calculate SL,T (k). A convenient way to introduce the
two-parameter scheme is to specify two separate polarity

ﬂuid of 1372 hard spheres with permanent dipole m, diame-
ter σ, polarizability α, and density ρ: (m∗)2 = βm2/σ3 = 1.0,
α∗ = α/σ3 = 0.06, ρσ3 = 0.8. The dielectric properties from
the simulations are: ǫs = 21.4, yeﬀ = 1.57, and yp = 1.54;
ǫ∞ = 1.75 is obtained from the Clausius-Mossotti equation.

Separate deﬁnitions of ξL and ξT in terms of SL(0)
and ST (0) [Eq. (46)] allows us to incorporate contribu-
tions to macroscopic dielectric properties which are not
present in the model of dipolar HS ﬂuids. Speciﬁcally,
the magnitude of parameter yeﬀ, calculated according
to Wertheim’s 1-RPT algorithm [93], deﬁnes the solvent
dipolar strength which strongly aﬀects the dielectric con-
stant. However, ǫs also depends on such factors as sol-
vent quadrupolar moment [87], solvent non-sphericity,
etc. The inﬂuence of these factors is incorporated into
SL,T (0) through the dielectric constant. Similarly, the
polarity parameters ξL
n are calculated from Eq.
(67) with SL,T (0) replaced by SL,T
n (0) taken from Eq.
(47).

n and ξT

Dipolar projections of the structure factors of molecu-
lar liquids modeled by site-site interaction potentials have
been studied previously [94, 98, 99, 100]. The PPSF pro-
cedure has also been tested against MC simulations of
dipolar hard sphere ﬂuids [36]. However, the structure
factors arising from the nuclear polarization as well as
the applicability of the PPSF to non-spherical molecules
with site-site potentials have not been previously tested.
This is the aim of the Monte Carlo (MC) and MD sim-
ulations carried out in this study. The details of the
simulation protocol are given in Appendix A and here
we focus only on the results.

Figure 7 shows the comparison of the transverse and
longitudinal components of the nuclear structure factors
calculated from the PPSF and from MC simulations.
The MC simulations (dashed lines in Fig. 7) have been
performed on a ﬂuid of 1372 polarizable dipolar hard
spheres characterized by dipole moment m, diameter σ,

and isotropic polarizability α ((m∗)2 = βm2/σ3 = 1.0,
α∗ = α/σ3 = 0.06, Appendix A). Since the simulation
protocol generates the induced polarization in equilib-
rium with the nuclear conﬁguration of the solvent [19],
the generated ensamble yields the nuclear polarization in
the Pekar partitioning [88].

ture factors of ambient water. The graphs in the upper and
lower panels are plotted against the same scale of k-values to
indicate that the details of the structure factors beyond ap-
proximately kσ ≃ π are insigniﬁcant for the calculation of the
reorganization energy.

The MSA solution in Eq. (65) was derived for a model
liquid of dipolar hard spheres. The parameterization in-
troduced by the PPSF suggests to use the experimental

11

≃

ǫs to accommodate empirically the features which are not
included in the MSA solution. Two factors, often present
in real polar solvents, molecular quadrupoles and non-
sphericity, are expected to aﬀect signiﬁcantly the form of
the structure factors. Therefore, we have performed MD
simulations for two solvents with well-developed force
ﬁelds, water [101] and acetonitrile [102]. Water is a rela-
tively symmetric molecule with a very large quadrupole
moment Q [103] ((Q∗)2 = βQ2/σ5 = 1.1) among com-
monly used molecular solvents. On the other hand, ace-
tonitrile has a small quadrupole moment ((Q∗)2 = 0.13),
but the molecule is very non-spherical with the aspect ra-
tio
3. Therefore, these two extreme cases may provide
a good test of the ability of the PPSF to incorporate the
complications related to molecular speciﬁcs of the sol-
vents in terms of their macroscopic dielectric constants.
Figure 8 (lower panel) shows the comparison of the
simulation results for TIP3P water to the PPSF. A
slightly wrong positioning of the longitudinal peak may
be related to a diﬀerent hard sphere diameter of TIP3P
water (see Table V in Appendix A) compared to the hard
sphere diameter of water at ambient conditions used in
scaling wavevectors in Figure 8. A downward scaling of
σ by just 5% results in a very good match between calcu-
lated and simulated structure factors. As expected, the
steric eﬀects of packing the solvent molecules in dense
liquids is the main factor determining the position of the
longitudinal peak. This indeed is seen in Fig. 9 for simu-
lations of acetonitrile. The eﬀective hard sphere diameter
obtained from solvent compressibility does not accommo-
date the fact that linear dipoles tend to pack side-to-side
pointing in opposite directions. The longitudinal thus
peak eﬀectively reﬂects a lower molecular diameter. The
preferential opposite orientation of the dipoles leads to
a low Kirkwood factor and the dielectric constant much
lower than one would expect for a dipolar solvent with
such large dipole moment (4.12 D for the force ﬁeld by
Edwards, Madden, and McDonald [102]). As a result,
the transverse structure factor does not change with k as
much as it does for hard sphere dipolar liquids (cf. Figs.
7 and 8 to Fig. 9). As is seen, the PPSF with ǫs from
MD simulations accommodates this feature of the solvent
quite well.

tails of the molecular structure of the polar solvent af-

are insigniﬁcant for the calculation of the reorganiza-
tion energy and the free energy gap. Therefore, the
discrepancies in the position of the longitudinal peak
between the simulations and the PPSF do not notice-
ably aﬀect the results of calculations. This statement
also applies to the range of k-values (k > 2π/ls, where

within the solvent molecule) at which the multipolar ap-
proximation for the charge distribution within the sol-
vent molecules breaks down. The charge-charge struc-

of small k-values aﬀecting the calculation of thermody-
namic properties unless the solute is much smaller than
the solvent.

B. Solute

The solute branch of the calculation algorithm (Fig.
6) consists of the numerical calculation of the Fourier
transform of the electric ﬁeld outside the solute placed in
the vacuum. The direct-space electric ﬁelds in the initial
and ﬁnal states of the solute are given by a superposition
of electric ﬁelds produced by partial charges qi

where the sum runs over M0 partial charges localized on
solute atoms. The ﬁeld E0i(r) is Fourier transformed in
the region Ω accessible to the solvent molecules [Eq. (33)].
The region Ω is generated by assigning vdW radii to all
atoms of the solute and then adding the hard sphere ra-
dius σ/2 of the solvent (σ = 2.87 ˚A for water and 4.14
˚A for acetonitrile). This creates the solvent-accessible
surface (SAS). The deﬁnition of the solute ﬁeld thus re-
quires atomic coordinates and vdW radii of N0 atoms of

12

the solute and M0 partial charges q0k to be used in Eq.
(70) (indicated as x0k, y0k, z0k, q0k in Fig. 6).

The inﬁnite-space Fourier transform of the Coulomb
electric ﬁeld [Eq. (33)] is numerically divergent [36]. This
numerical problem is obviated by splitting the region of
integration into the inner part between the SAS and a
cutoﬀ sphere and the region outside the cutoﬀ sphere.
The Fourier transform within the sphere is calculated
numerically by the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) tech-
nique [108] on a cube with the center at the geometrical

combining the numerical and analytical parts is used to
calculate the longitudinal and transverse components of
the electrostatic energy density in Eqs. (60) and (61).
These components are then used in the k-integrals with
the polarization structure factors (Eqs. (53)–(58); also
see Fig. 6).

V. RESULTS AND COMPARISON TO
EXPERIMENT

A. Solvent reorganization energy

The solvent reorganization energy of complex 1 was
previously obtained from MD simulations of this com-
plex in TIP3P water [40]. The permanent dipole moment
in this force ﬁeld is enhanced from the vacuum dipole of
1.87 D to 2.35 D to account for water polarizability. This
results in a dielectric constant of ǫs = 97.5 from our sim-
ulations, which agrees well with ǫs = 97.0 found in the
literature [109]. Table I lists the results of calculations of
the reorganization energy with structure factors from the
PPSF (column 5) and from MD simulations (column 7).
The density of the solvent in the N V T simulations was
adjusted at each temperature in order to reproduce the
10−4 K−1 of TIP3P water [110].
expansivity αp = 2.96
The temperature derivative of the reorganization energy
thus gives the constant-pressure reorganization entropy

(72)

Overall, there is an exceptionally good agreement be-
tween the reorganization energies calculated by using the
structure factors from PPSF and MD simulations. This
is not surprising in view of the very good agreement be-
tween the two sets of structure factors shown in Fig. 8.
The PPSF result at 298 K, λs = 64.11 kcal/mol, also
compares well with the direct calculation of the reorga-
nization energy from MD simulations, where the value of
60.9 kcal/mol was reported [40]. The electrostatic forces
in those simulations were cut oﬀ at distances greater than
10.1 ˚A. The cutoﬀ is expected to lower the reorganization
energy compared to that of an inﬁnite system. In order
to estimate the eﬀect of the interaction cutoﬀ, we have
calculated the reorganization energy for a ﬁctitious so-
lute with the distance 10.1 ˚A added to the radius of each
atom exposed to the solvent. This contribution amounts
to 7.1 kcal/mol. Column 6 in Table I shows the results
of calculations when the k-dependent polarization struc-
ture factors are replaced by their k = 0 values. The gap
in λs values between columns 5 and 6 thus quantiﬁes the
contribution of the non-local part of solvent response to
the reorganization energy. The last (10) column in Table
I shows the PPSF calculations using parameters of am-
bient water. In these calculations, the gas phase dipole
moment m = 1.87 D is renormalized by the polarizability
eﬀect to give m′ = 2.43 D (Wertheim’s 1-RPT formal-
ism [19, 93]). Despite this renormalization, λs in this

calculations using parameters of TIP3P water. TIP3P
water thus appears to produce stronger solvation than
ambient water.

Table I also presents two components of the solvent re-
organization energy produced by solvent quadrupoles: λq
is the second cumulant of the coupling of the solute elec-
tric ﬁeld gradient to solvent quadrupole moment [38, 67]
whereas λpq is a mixed term arising from correlated ﬂuc-
tuations of dipoles and quadrupoles positioned at diﬀer-
ent solvent molecules [67, 111]. The resulting solvent re-
organization energy is the sum of the dipolar component
λp and two quadrupolar components:

λs = λp + λpq + λq.

(73)

The problem of quadrupolar solvent reorganization
has recently attracted much attention [65, 66, 67, 112]
in connection with new experimental data showing ap-
preciable solvent reorganization in non-dipolar solvents
[113, 114, 115, 116, 117]. However, the components λq
and λpq constitute only a small fraction of the overall
reorganization energy despite a relatively high reduced
quadrupole of water, βQ2/σ5 = 1.1 (cf. to (Q∗)2 = 0.13
of acetonitrile). For the rest of the paper we will therefore
assume

λp.

λs ≃
We note that the value λs = 69.7 kcal/mol calculated for
TIP3P water with the account of water quadrupoles is in
remarkable agreement with λs = 68 kcal/mol obtained
by correcting the simulated values [40] by the ﬁnite-size
cutoﬀ eﬀects.

(74)

The dependence of λs and the reorganization entropy
on ǫ∞ are given in Table II. In these calculations, the

vacuum dipole moment of water, 1.83 D, was held con-
stant along with the total dielectric constant ǫs = 78.0.
The change in ǫ∞ was achieved by varying the polariz-
ability α according to the Clausius-Mossotti equation

ǫ∞ + 2

(75)

where η = (π/6)ρσ3 is the solvent packing fraction.

Two drastically diﬀerent predictions for the eﬀect of
solvent polarizability on λs can be found in the liter-
ature. The classical Marcus two-sphere model [1] pre-
dicts a drop of λs by about a factor of 0.6 when going
from ǫ∞ = 1.0 to ǫ∞ = 1.8. On the other hand, simu-
lations using non-polarizable and polarizable versions of
the water force ﬁeld predict almost no dependence of λs
on solvent polarizability [17, 118]. The actual situation
is in between of the two extremes. The reorganization
energy does drop with increasing ǫ∞, but not as much
as is predicted by continuum models [19]. On the other
hand, the change is suﬃcient to make simulations based
on non-polarizable solvent models unreliable.

dashed lines refer to the numerical solution of the Poisson
equation with the vdW (cont./vdW) and SAS (cont./SAS)
cavities. The diamond and square indicate TIP3P and ambi-
ent water, respectively.

The situation for the dependence of λs on ǫ∞ is illus-
trated in Fig. 10, where continuum results for complex 1
obtained with the DelPhi Poisson-Boltzmann solver [119]
are compared to the calculations within the NRFT. The
dielectric calculations with the vdW dielectric cavity (de-
noted “cont./vdW” in Fig. 10) show a substantial drop of
λs with ǫ∞. The dependence on ǫ∞ is much weaker in the
NRFT (see also Table II). The weak dependence of λs
on ǫ∞ is the result of the cancellation of two competing
factors: the decrease of the longitudinal structure factor
in the range of small k-values with increasing ǫ∞ (Fig. 5)
compensated by an increase in yp due to higher solvent
dipole m′ in more polarizable solvents. We note that this
cancellation is strongly aﬀected by the k-dependence of
the polarization structure factors in the range of small
k-values contributing to the k-integral and cannot be re-
duced to the cancellation of the yp factor in λs [Eqs. (53)
and (57)] with yp in the denominator in Eq. (47), result-
ing in the Pekar factor of continuum electrostatics.

14

≃

n (k)

The continuum limit of the NRFT is obtained when
the dependence on the wavevector k is neglected in the
solvent structure factors and one assumes SL,T (k)
≃
SL,T
SL,T (0) and SL,T
n (0). When this assumption
is incorporated in the microscopic calculations (marked
NRFT/S(0) in Fig. 10), the resultant reorganization en-
ergy gains the strong dependence on ǫ∞ characteristic of
continuum theories. The continuum limit of the micro-
scopic theory corresponds, however, to the dielectric cav-
ity coinciding with the SAS. The corresponding DelPhi
calculation (marked cont./SAS in Fig. 10) indeed goes
parallel with the continuum limit of the NRFT. The dis-
tinction between these two results arises from the mean-
ﬁeld approximation used in the NRFT formulation and
diﬀerent handling of the polarizability eﬀects in the two
formulations (additive in the continuum and non-additive
in the microscopic formulation [92]). Note that the mean-
ﬁeld approximation is more accurate, when compared to
the exact solution of the Li-Kardar-Chandler equation,
in the full microscopic formulation than in its continuum
limit [36]. The exact formulation of the theory, which
does not involve the mean-ﬁeld approximation, gives the
solution of the Poisson equation in its continuum limit.
The numerical values for the reorganization energies
shown in Fig. 10 are given in Table II. The comparison
between the microscopic and continuum calculations is
instructive. At ǫ∞ = 1, λs from the vdW continuum
is much higher than the microscopic calculation, while
λs from the SAS continuum is close to the microscopic
result. With increasing ǫ∞, on the other hand, λs from
the vdW continuum falls down almost to the microscopic
value. The continuum calculation with the vdW cavity
may thus appear in a reasonable accord with microscopic
calculations or experiment due to the mutual cancellation
of errors.

Along with reorganization energies, Table II lists re-
organization entropies Sλ [Eq. (72)]. Note that Sλ ob-
tained from the PPSF calibrated on TIP3P water is in a
reasonable agreement with the corresponding value ob-
tained with the structure factors from MD simulations:
84.1 e.u. and 69.9 e.u., respectively. The dielectric con-
tinuum calculation gives the wrong sign for the entropy
in accord with previous reports [12, 29]. Also the mag-
nitude of Sλ is substantially higher in the microscopic
theory than in the continuum calculation (cf. columns 4
and 6 in Table II).

A similar trend is seen for the reaction free energy gap

(Table III) for which the reaction entropy is deﬁned as

∆Ss =

(∂∆Gs/∂T )P .

−

(76)

Although the sign of ∆Ss is correct in the continuum
calculations, the entropy magnitude is much lower than
in the NRFT, similar to a previous report for a diﬀer-
ent ET system [12], where ∆Ss was experimentally ob-
tained from temperature dependent absorption and emis-
sion charge-transfer bands. Since the analytical theory
seems to be consistent with the computer experiment,
one needs a test against experimental data. Unfortu-

lations of vibrational states should be used for the ET
rate in complex 1. Unfortunately, our calculations pro-
vide only the solvent component of the free energy gap.

coupling entering the Golden Rule ET rate in Eq. (1)
is known with uncertainty [40]. These two parameters
(∆Gg and V12) were varied in ﬁtting the experimental
activation enthalpy ∆H † = 9.5 kcal/mol and the experi-
mental activation entropy ∆S†/kB =

that the experimental quantity is an eﬀective entropy,
including contributions due to the electronic coupling el-

given by electronic structure calculations [40] using the
semiempirical INDO/s model by Zerner and co-workers
[121]. The equilibrium gap obtained from the ﬁt is ap-
preciably more negative than ∆G
25.4 kcal/mol es-
timated from the redox potentials of separate donor and
acceptor sites, based on the high spin ground state of
the Co2+ product (it has been argued [40] that the less
exothermic low spin Co2+ product may be the relevant
one in the experimentally observed process). Neglecting
the vibrational excitations in the analysis (0-0 transition
only) results in a much lower activation enthalpy and a
substantially more negative activation entropy (second
row in Table IV).

The relatively low frequency of metal-ligand vibrations
in transition metal complexes results in a dense manifold
of vibrational levels (Fig. 11) which are partially popu-
lated at room temperature. The change of the vibrational
populations with temperature may result in a contribu-
tion to the overall activation entropy [122]. This, how-
ever, does not happen for complex 1 when λs and ∆Gs
are ﬁxed at their 298 K values. The dashed lines in Fig.
12 show the enthalpy and entropy of activation as a func-
tion of the vibrational frequency at constant temperature
and λv. Increasing the vibrational frequency makes vi-
brational excitations less accessible, but this is seen to
have little eﬀect on the activation entropy and enthalpy.
This situation changes when the temperature depen-
dence of λs and ∆Gs is included in the calculations of the
Arrhenius activation parameters. In this case, the tem-
perature dependence of the ET energy gap results in a
change of the vibrational quantum numbers correspond-
ing to the maximum vibronic contribution. The splitting
of the activation barrier into the entropic and enthalpic
contribution then becomes sensitive to the choice of ωv
(Fig. 12, solid lines). This sensitivity may be important
for the interpretation of experimental data since the cor-
rect deﬁnition of the eﬀective vibrational frequency [Eq.
(15)] increases in importance once the temperature de-

systems after proper parameterization of dielectric cavi-
ties, despite drastic approximations involved. The micro-
scopic NRFT formulation contains dielectric continuum
as its limit, allowing us to address this question. The
continuum limit is obtained by neglecting the spatial cor-
relations between solvent dipoles, i.e. by neglecting the k-
dependence in the polarization response functions. This
implies that polarization structure factors are replaced
by their k = 0 values (Fig. 13). This replacement is not
a good approximation for the transverse structure factor,
which changes quite sharply even for small k-values, but
may be a reasonable approximation for the longitudinal
structure factor, which is relatively ﬂat in the range of
k-values signiﬁcant for solvation thermodynamics. How-
ever, for most charge conﬁgurations, even for the point
dipole [35], the contribution of transverse polarization to
10% in
the solvation free energy is relatively small [36] (
our calculations for complex 1 in water). Therefore, the
inaccurate continuum approximation for the transverse
structure factor does not signiﬁcantly aﬀect the results
of calculations.

The continuum estimates for the polarization structure
factors result in the following inequalities between the
continuum and microscopic longitudinal and transverse
components of the reorganization energy

The sharp change of the transverse structure factor at
small k-values is responsible for a substantial overesti-
mate of the transverse component of solvation by contin-
uum models [35, 36]. This overestimate manifests itself in
solvation dynamics. The transverse polarization dynam-
ics is much slower than the longitudinal polarization dy-
namics [27]. Therefore, continuum models predict bipha-
sic solvation dynamics with an appreciable slow compo-
nent due to transverse polarization relaxation. This slow
component is not observed in computer simulations of
solvation dynamics [123] and it does not show up in the
microscopic calculations reported in Ref. 39.

The relatively ﬂat form of the longitudinal structure
factors at low k-values does not mean that replacing
SL,T (k) by SL,T (0) gives accurate numbers for the sol-
vation free energy and/or the reorganization energy. A
moderate increase of SL(k) in the range of wavevectors
contributing to the k-integral substantially aﬀects the

calculated values of solvation free energies (cf. columns 5
and 6 in Table I). Moreover, the gap between the micro-
scopic and continuum values changes with the solvent di-
electric parameters (see, e.g., Fig. 10). This observation
practically means that there is fundamentally no unique
scheme for deﬁning the dielectric cavity applicable to all
solvent polarities.

The dominance of longitudinal polarization ﬂuctua-
tions in solvation thermodynamics is also responsible for
experimentally observed linear trends of the reorgani-
zation energy with the Pekar factor [50, 124, 125] [Eq.
(48)]. Even at the continuum level, the polarization re-
sponse function for a solute of complex shape is not repre-
sented by the Pekar factor appearing in the longitudinal
projection of the solvent response function [126]. How-
ever, large separation of charges is responsible for the
predominantly longitudinal response of the solvent, and
continuum reorganization energies calculated for complex
1 in polar solvents correlate well with the Pekar factor
(Fig. 14a). If fact, an equally good correlation is seen in
respect to the Lippert-Mataga polarity parameter com-
monly used for solvation of dipoles (Fig. 14b):

The use of a particular parameter does not therefore tell

shown by triangles in Fig. 14. These numbers do not ex-
hibit a linear dependence, although the extent of scatter
is not uncommon for ET experiment. The comparison of
the continuum and microscopic dependence on the sol-
vent polarity does not permit a clear distinction between
the two formulations. Where the distinction becomes
clear is for the reorganization entropy in strongly polar
solvents. Figure 15 shows reorganization entropies Sλ
calculated in continuum (DelPhi [7] Poisson-Bolzmann
solver) and microscopic (NRFT) theories. The contin-
uum calculation reﬂects the temperature variation of the
Pekar factor c0:

In low-polarity solvents, c0 is mostly inﬂuenced by the
static dielectric constant, which has a negative temper-
ature derivative. The continuum reorganization entropy
(closed circles in Fig. 15) is positive and is close to the
microscopic result (open squares in Fig. 15). The contin-
uum estimate of the temperature variation of λs in low-
polarity solvents thus gives a semi-quantitative account
of the experimental observations [51]. In strongly polar
solvents, the temperature derivative of c0 is mostly inﬂu-
enced by the high-frequency dielectric constant, and con-
tinuum Sλ is nagative. In this case, the predictions of the
continuum model signiﬁcantly depart from both the mi-
croscopic calculations and many experimental measure-
ments [12, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 50], showing positive reor-
ganization entropies.

The microscopic calculations presented here show a rel-
atively weak dependence of the reorganization energy on
the solvent high-frequency dielectric constant, in qual-
itative accord with available computer simulation data
[17, 18, 19]. Testing this theoretical prediction experi-
mentally may become problematic because of the narrow
range of ǫ∞ values available for common polar solvents.
We note, however, that the problem of the weak depen-
dence of the reorganization energy on ǫ∞ is related to
the problem of correct sign of the reorganization entropy.
The strong dependence of the continuum reorganization
energy on ǫ∞ is one of major factors shifting the con-
tinuum reorganization entropy to the range of positive
values.

The calculations of the quadrupolar component of
the solvent reorganization energy presented here con-
ﬁrm the conclusion previously reached for Stokes shifts in
coumarin-153 optical dye [127]: quadrupolar solvation is
insigniﬁcant in most commonly used polar solvents, and
the dipolar approximation for the solvent charge distri-
bution is suﬃcient for most practical calculations.

McDonald [102] and the 3-site model of water (TIP3P) by
Jorgensen et al. [101] (Table V). The site-site interaction

We used the Nos´e-Hoover thermostat [129] for the
ACN3 simulations with the relaxation parameter of 0.5
fs. This value ensures good stabilization of the total sys-
tem energy. The energy drift for ACN3 is only about
0.1%. The simulation box was constructed to include
256 ACN3 molecules in a cube with the side length
L = 28.2025 ˚A at T=298 K to reproduce the experi-
mental mass density of acetonitrile, ρM =0.777 g/cm3.
The side length is adjusted at each temperature to ac-
count for temperature expansion with the experimental
volume expansion coeﬃcient αp = 1.38

10−3 K−1.

×

In simulations of TIP3P water, 256 molecules reside in
a cube with the side length of L = 19.7744 ˚A at 298 K.
The system is coupled to the Berendsen [130] thermostat
with the relaxation time of 0.1 fs. The drift in total en-
ergy of about 0.1 % is observed. The liquid mass density
ρM = 0.9896 g/cm3 and the volume expansion coeﬃcient
10−3 K−1 are taken from Ref. 110. The latter
αp = 2.96
value is close to the experimental expansion coeﬃcient of
ambient water, αp = 2.6

The cutoﬀ for short-range LJ interaction is 13 ˚A for
ACN3 and 9 ˚A for TIP3P. For long-range Coulomb inter-
actions, Ewald summation from DL POLY [131] is used
for ACN3 and smoothed particle mesh (SPME) [132]
Ewald is adopted for TIP3P. Ewald summation parame-
ters are the convergence parameter α and the maximum

[86] Diﬀerent partitioning schemes of the solvent polariza-
tion into the fast and slow components can be im-
plemented for solvation thermodynamics calculations
[88, 90, 91]. Although they all give identical results for
the thermodynamics of solvation, they will lead to dif-
ferent predictions regarding the solvation dynamics. The
Pekar partitioning results in slow relaxation of the com-
ponent of induced dipole (pR
j in Eq. (37)) in equilibrium
with the ﬁeld of permanent dipoles in the liquid.

[118] In the simulations of Bader and Berne [17] the charge in-
duced by formaldehyde taken as a solute on each solvent
molecule (corresponding to dipole p0
j in Eq. (37)) was
not subtracted from the overall induced charge. Their
reported reorganization energies correspond, therefore,
to the sum of the reorganization energy due to nuclear
polarization ﬂuctuations, λs, and a reorganization en-
ergy arising from ﬂuctuations of the solute-solvent in-
duction interaction, λind (see, e.g., D. V. Matyushov
and R. Schmid, Mol. Phys. 84, 533 (1995)).

It is shown that the recently observed ∆I = 2 staggering seen in superdeformed nu-
clear bands is also occurring in certain electronically excited rotational bands of diatomic
molecules. In the case of diatomic molecules the eﬀect is attributed to interband interactions
(bandcrossings).

Abstract

I. Introduction
Several staggering eﬀects are known in nuclear spectroscopy [1]:
1) In rotational γ bands of even nuclei the energy levels with odd angular momentum
I (I=3, 5, 7, 9, . . . ) are slightly displaced relatively to the levels with even I (I=2, 4, 6,
8, . . . ), i.e. the odd levels do not lie at the energies predicted by an E(I) = AI(I + 1) ﬁt
to the even levels, but all of them lie systematically above or all of them lie systematically
below the predicted energies [2].

2) In octupole bands of even nuclei the levels with odd I and negative parity (I π=1−, 3−,
5−, 7−, . . . ) are displaced relatively to the levels with even I and positive parity (I π=0+,
2+, 4+, 6+, . . . ) [3].

3) In odd nuclei, rotational bands (with K = 1/2) separate into signature partners, i.e.
the levels with I=3/2, 7/2, 11/2, 15/2, . . . are displaced relatively to the levels with I=1/2,
5/2, 9/2, 13/2, . . . [4].

In all of the above mentioned cases each level with angular momentum I is displaced
relatively to its neighbours with angular momentum I ± 1. The eﬀect is then called ∆I = 1
staggering.

A new kind of staggering (∆I = 2 staggering) has been recently observed [5, 6] in
superdeformed nuclear bands [7, 8, 9]. If ∆I = 2 staggering is present, then, for example,
the levels with I=2, 6, 10, 14, . . . are displaced relatively to the levels with I=0, 4, 8, 12,
. . . , i.e. the level with angular momentum I is displaced relatively to its neighbours with
angular momentum I ± 2.

Although ∆I = 1 staggering of the types mentioned above has been observed in several
nuclei and certainly is an eﬀect larger than the relevant experimental uncertainties, ∆I = 2
staggering has been seen in only a few cases [5, 6, 10, 11] and, in addition, the eﬀect is not
clearly larger than the relevant experimental errors.

There have been by now several theoretical works related to the possible physical origin
of the ∆I = 2 staggering eﬀect [12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18], some of them [19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24]
using symmetry arguments which could be of applicability to other physical systems as well.
On the other hand, rotational spectra of diatomic molecules [25] are known to show great
similarities to nuclear rotational spectra, having in addition the advantage that observed
rotational bands in several diatomic molecules [26, 27, 28, 29] are much longer than the
usual rotational nuclear bands. We have been therefore motivated to make a search for
∆I = 2 staggering in rotational bands of diatomic molecules. The questions to which we
have hoped to provide answers are:

1) Is there ∆I = 2 staggering in rotational bands of diatomic molecules?
2) If there is, what are its possible physical origins?
In Section II of the present work the ∆I = 2 staggering in superdeformed nuclear bands
will be brieﬂy reviewed. Evidence from existing experimental data for ∆I = 2 staggering
in rotational bands of diatomic molecules will be presented in Section III and discussed in
Section IV, while Section V will contain the conclusions drawn.

II. ∆I = 2 staggering in superdeformed nuclear bands

In nuclear physics the experimentally determined quantities are the γ-ray transition
energies between levels diﬀering by two units of angular momentum (∆I = 2). For these
the symbol

E2,γ(I) = E(I + 2) − E(I)

(1)

2

is used, where E(I) denotes the energy of the level with angular momentum I. The deviation
of the γ-ray transition energies from the rigid rotator behavior can be measured by the
quantity [6]

∆E2,γ(I) =

(6E2,γ(I) − 4E2,γ(I − 2) − 4E2,γ(I + 2) + E2,γ(I − 4) + E2,γ(I + 4)).

Using the rigid rotator expression

E(I) = AI(I + 1),

one can easily see that in this case ∆E2,γ(I) vanishes.
rotator expression

In addition the perturbed rigid

E(I) = AI(I + 1) + B(I(I + 1))2,

gives vanishing ∆E2,γ(I). These properties are due to the fact that Eq. (2) is a (normalized)
discrete approximation of the fourth derivative of the function E2,γ(I), i.e. essentially the
ﬁfth derivative of the function E(I).

In superdeformed nuclear bands the angular momentum of the observed states is in
most cases unknown. To avoid this diﬃculty, the quantity ∆E2,γ is usually plotted not
versus the angular momentum I, but versus the angular frequency

which for discrete states takes the approximate form

ω =

dE(I)
dI

,

E(I + 2) − E(I)

ω =

q(I + 2)(I + 3) −

qI(I + 1)

.

ω =

E(I + 2) − E(I)
2

=

E2,γ(I)

.

For large I one can take the Taylor expansions of the square roots in the denominator, thus
obtaining

Examples of superdeformed nuclear bands exhibiting staggering are shown in Figs 1–
2 [5, 6]. We say that ∆I = 2 staggerimg is observed if the quantity ∆E2(I) exhibits
alternating signs with increasing ω (i.e. with increasing I, according to Eq. (7)). The
following observations can be made:

1) The magnitude of ∆E2(I) is of the order of 10−4–10−5 times the size of the gamma

transition energies.

2) The best example of ∆I = 2 staggering is given by the ﬁrst superdeformed band of
149Gd, shown in Fig. 1a. In this case the eﬀect is almost larger than the experimental error.
3) In most cases the ∆I = 2 staggering is smaller than the experimental error (see Figs

1b, 2a, 2b), with the exception of a few points in Fig. 1b.

III. ∆I = 2 staggering in rotational bands of diatomic molecules

In the case of molecules [30] the experimentally determined quantities regard the R
branch ((vlower, I) → (vupper, I + 1)) and the P branch ((vlower, I) → (vupper, I − 1)), where

3

(3)

(4)

(5)

(6)

(7)

vlower is the vibrational quantum number of the initial state, while vupper is the vibrational
quantum number of the ﬁnal state. They are related to transition energies through the
equations [30]

(8)

(9)

(10)

ER(I) − EP (I) = Evupper (I + 1) − Evupper (I − 1) = DE2,vupper (I),

ER(I − 1) − EP (I + 1) = Evlower (I + 1) − Evlower (I − 1) = DE2,vlower (I),

where in general

DE2,v(I) = Ev(I + 1) − Ev(I − 1).

∆I = 2 staggering can then be estimated by using Eq.
DE2,v(I):

(2), with E2,γ(I) replaced by

∆E2,v(I) =

(6DE2,v(I)−4DE2,v(I−2)−4DE2,v(I+2)+DE2,v(I−4)+DE2,v(I+4)). (11)

Results for several rotational bands in diﬀerent electronic and vibrational states of var-
ious diatomic molecules are shown in Figs 3–9. We say that ∆I = 2 staggering is observed
if the quantity ∆E2(I) exhibits alternating signs with increasing I (I is increased by 2 units
each time). The magnitude of ∆E2(I) is usually of the order of 10−3–10−5 times the size
of the interlevel separation energy. Several observations can be made:

1) In all cases shown, the “upper” bands (which happen to be electronically excited)
exhibit (Figs 3, 4, 7-9) ∆I = 2 staggering which is 2 to 3 orders of magnitude larger than
the experimental error, while the corresponding “lower” bands (which, in the cases studied,
correspond to the electronic ground state of each molecule), show (Figs 5, 6) some eﬀect
smaller than the experimental error.

2) There is no uniform dependence of the ∆I = 2 staggering on the angular momentum
I. In some cases of long bands, though, it appears that the pattern is a sequence of points
exhibiting small staggering, interrupted by groups of 6 points each time showing large
staggering. The best examples can be seen in Figs 3a, 3b, 7a, 7b. In Fig. 3a (odd levels
of the v = 1 C1Σ+ band of YD)) the ﬁrst group of points showing appreciable ∆I = 2
staggering appears at I = 13–23, while the second group appears at I = 27–37. In Fig. 3b
(even levels of the v = 1 C1Σ+ band of YD) the ﬁrst group appears at I = 12–22, while
the second group at I = 26–36. In Fig. 7a (odd levels of the v = 0 A6Σ+ band of CrD)
the ﬁrst group appears at I = 15–25, while the second at I = 27–37. Similarly in Fig. 7b
(even levels of the v = 0 A6Σ+ band of CrD) the ﬁrst group appears at I = 14–24, while
the second group at I = 26–36.

3) In all cases shown, the results obtained for the odd levels of a band are in good
agreement with the results obtained for the even levels of the same band. For example, the
regions showing appreciable staggering are approximately the same in both cases (compare
Fig. 3a with Fig. 3b and Fig. 7a with Fig. 7b, already discussed in 2) ). In addition, the
positions of the local staggering maxima in each pair of ﬁgures are closely related. In Fig.
3a, for example, maximum staggering appears at I = 19 and I = 31, while in Fig. 3b the
maxima appear at I = 18 and I = 32.

4) In several cases the ∆I = 2 staggering of a band can be calculated from two diﬀerent
sets of data. For example, Figs 3a, 3b show the ∆I = 2 staggering of the v = 1 C1Σ+
band of YD calculated from the data on the 1–1 C1Σ+–X1Σ+ transitions, while Figs 3c,

4

3d show the staggering of the same band calculated from the data on the 1–2 C1Σ+–X1Σ+
transition. We remark that the results concerning points showing staggering larger than
the experimental error come out completely consistently from the two calculations (region
with I = 13–23 in Figs 3a, 3c; region with I = 12–22 in Figs 3b, 3d), while the results
concerning points exhibiting staggering of the order of the experimental error come out
randomly (in Fig. 3a, for example, I = 11 corresponds to a local minimum, while in Fig.
3c it corresponds to a local maximum). Similar results are seen in the pairs of ﬁgures
(3b, 3d), (4a, 4c), (4b, 4d), (6a, 6c), (6b, 6d), (9a, 9c), (9b, 9d). The best example of
disagreement between staggering pictures of the same band calculated from two diﬀerent
sets of data is oﬀered by Figs 6b, 6d, which concern the v = 2 X1Σ+ band of YD, which
shows staggering of the order of the experimental error.

5) When considering levels of the same band, in some cases the odd levels exhibit larger
staggering than the even levels, while in other cases the opposite is true. In the v = 1 C1Σ+
band of YD, for example, the odd levels (shown in Fig. 3a, corroborated by Fig. 3c) show
staggering larger than that of the even levels (shown in Fig. 3b, corroborated by Fig. 3d),
while in the v = 2 C1Σ+ band of YD the odd levels (shown in Fig. 4a, corroborated by Fig.
4c) exhibit staggering smaller than that of the even levels (shown in Fig. 4b, corroborated
by Fig. 4d).

IV. Discussion

The observations made above can be explained by the assumption that the staggering
observed is due to the presence of one or more bandcrossings [31, 32]. The following points
support this assumption:

1) It is known [33] that bandcrossing occurs in cases in which the interband interaction is
weak. In such cases only the one or two levels closest to the crossing point are aﬀected [34].
However, if one level is inﬂuenced by the crossing, in the corresponding staggering ﬁgure
six points get inﬂuenced. For example, if E(16) is inﬂuenced by the crossing, the quantities
DE2(15) and DE2(17) are inﬂuenced (see Eq. (10) ), so that in the corresponding ﬁgure
the points ∆E2(I) with I = 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21 are inﬂuenced, as seen from Eq. (11).
This fact explains why points showing appreciable staggering appear in groups of 6 at a
time.

2) It is clear that if bandcrossing occurs, large staggering should appear in approximately
the same angular momentum regions of both even levels and odd levels. As we have already
seen, this is indeed the case.

3) It is clear that when two bands cross each other, maximum staggering will appear
at the angular momentum for which the energies of the relevant levels of each band are
approximately equal [34]. If this angular momentum value happens to be odd, then ∆E2(I)
for even values of I in this region (the group of 6 points centered at this I) will show larger
staggering than the ∆E2(I) for odd values of I in the corresponding region, and vice versa.
For example, if the closest approach of two bands occurs for I = 31, then ∆E2(I) for even
values of I in the I = 26–36 region will show larger staggering than ∆E2(I) for odd values
of I in the same region. This is in agreement with the empirical observation that in some
cases the odd levels show larger staggering than the even levels, while in other cases the
opposite holds.

4) The presence of staggering in the “upper” (electronically excited) bands and the lack
of staggering in the “lower” (electronic ground state) bands can be attributed to the fact

5

that the electronically excited bands have several neighbours with which they can interact,
while the bands built on the electronic ground state are relatively isolated, and therefore
no bandcrossings occur in this case. In the case of the CrD molecule, in particular, it is
known [27] that there are many strong Cr atomic lines present, which frequently overlap the
relatively weaker (electronically excited) molecular lines. In addition, Ne atomic lines are
present [27]. Similarly, in the case of the YD molecule the observed spectra are inﬂuenced
by Y and Ne atomic lines [26], while in the case of the CrH molecule there are Ne and Cr
atomic lines inﬂuencing the molecular spectra [28].

5) The fact that consistency between results for the same band calculated from two
diﬀerent sets of data is observed only in the cases in which the staggering is much larger
than the experimental error, corroborates the bandcrossing explanation. The fact that the
results obtained in areas in which the staggering is of the order of the experimantal error,
or even smaller, appear to be random, points towards the absence of any real eﬀect in these
regions.

It should be noticed that bandcrossing has been proposed [35, 36, 37] as a possible
explanation for the appearance of ∆I = 2 staggering eﬀects in normally deformed nuclear
bands [18, 35, 37] and superdeformed nuclear bands [36].

The presence of two subsequent bandcrossings can also provide an explanation for the
eﬀect of mid-band disappearance of ∆I = 2 staggering observed in superdeformed bands
of some Ce isotopes [10]. The eﬀect seen in the Ce isotopes is very similar to the mid-band
disappearance of staggering seen, for example, in Fig. 3a.

V. Conclusion

In conclusion, we have found several examples of ∆I = 2 staggering in electronically
excited bands of diatomic molecules. The details of the observed eﬀect are in agreement with
the assumption that it is due to one or more bandcrossings. In these cases the magnitude
of the eﬀect is clearly larger than the experimental error. In cases in which an eﬀect of the
order of the experimental error appears, we have shown that this is an artifact of the method
used, since diﬀerent sets of data from the same experiment and for the same molecule lead
to diﬀerent staggering results for the same rotational band. The present work emphasizes
the need to ensure in all cases (including staggering candidates in nuclear physics) that the
eﬀect is larger than the experimental error and, in order to make assumptions about any
new symmetry, that it is not due to a series of bandcrossings.

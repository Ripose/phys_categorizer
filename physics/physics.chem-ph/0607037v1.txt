ABSTRACT: Interrelation of the Coleman’s representabilty theory for 1-
density operators and abstract algebraic form of the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem is
studied in detail. Convenient realization of the Hohenberg-Kohn set of classes of
1-electron operators and the Coleman’s set of ensemble representable 1-density
operators is presented. Dependence of the Hohenberg-Kohn class structure on the
boundary properties of the ground state 1-density operator is established and is
illustrated on concrete simple examples. Algorithm of restoration of many electron
determinant ensembles from a given 1-density diagonal is described. Complete
description of the combinatorial structure of Coleman’s polyhedrons is obtained.

Key words: density operators; representability problem; density functional

theory

I. Introduction
In the middle of the twentieth century there appeared two papers that
became contemporary classics and called into being a new branch of quan-
tum chemistry. The ﬁrst paper, dedicated, at ﬁrst glance, to solution of a
very abstract problem of representability of 1-density operators by ensem-
bles of many electron states, was written by Coleman and published in 1963
[1]. One year later, in 1964, Hohenberg and Kohn published their theo-
rem [2] about correspondence between representable densities and external
potentials. From mathematical point of view both results belong to the func-
tional analysis and have close interrelation. Coleman’s theorem gives explicit
analytic description of the set of all ensemble representable 1-density opera-
tors and Hohenberg-Kohn theorem suggests implicit way of parametrization
of representable 1-density functions by certain classes of 1-electron operators
(potentials). Further development of Coleman’s approach was mainly concen-
trated on attempts to get the necessary and suﬃcient conditions of ensemble
representability for density operators of higher order, especially for 2-electron
density operators (see [3, 4] and references therein). It turned out to be a
very complicated mathematical problem and to the best of our knowledge
the constructive analytic description of the set of all representable 2-density

1

operators is still not found. On the contrary, mathematically almost triv-
ial Hohenberg-Kohn statement became a banner of the density functional
community and is considered at present as the foundation of the density
functional theory (DFT) (see, e.g., [5]-[8]).

The present paper is an attempt to give reasonably rigorous analysis
of both the Coleman’s theory and abstract form of the Hohenberg-Kohn
theorem for the case when one-electron sector of the Fock space is of ﬁnite
dimension.

Section II is dedicated to 1-density operators and their properties. Be-
sides formulation of diﬀerent versions of the Coleman’s theorem, a useful
realization of the set of all ensemble representable 1-density operators is
given. Combinatorial structure of Coleman’s polyhedrons is discussed in Ap-
pendix A. In Appendix B an example of constructive description of the set
of 1-density operators representable by pure states may be found.

In Section III general iteration formula for restoration of many electron
determinant ensembles from some ﬁxed representable 1-electron diagonal is
discussed. This formula ﬁrst appeared in our electronic publication [9]. Con-
crete numerical examples of using this formula are given.

In Section IV a very general algebraic formulation of the Hohenberg-
Kohn statement is analyzed. Abstract considerations are accompanying by
concrete examples demonstrating dependence of 1-density diagonal matrix
elements on parametrized classes of 1-electron operators.

II. General Properties of 1-Density Operators

In coordinate representation density operator of the ﬁrst order (1-density

operator) is introduced as the integral operator

ρ : ψ(x) →

ρ(x, x′)ψ(x′)dx′

(1)

acting on the one-electron sector of the Fock space. Here x is a vector of
space-spin variables and ρ(x, x′) is a kernel of the operator (1). This oper-
ator is said to be representable by a pure p−electron state Ψ(x1, . . . , xp)
if its kernel can be obtained by contraction (integration) of the product
Ψ(x, . . . , xp)Ψ∗(x′, . . . , xp) over p − 1 variables:

ρ(x, x′) =

. . .

gives a kernel of the so-called ensemble representable density operator. The
diagonal part ρ(x) = ρ(x, x) of this kernel is called (ensemble) representable
density function and plays fundamental role in the density functional theory.
Directly from deﬁnition three properties of representable 1-density oper-

ators are easily deduced:

(1) ρ† = ρ (Hermiteancy);
(2) ρ ≥ 0 (positive semi-deﬁniteness);
(3) T r ρ = 1.
Density operators satisfying conditions (1)-(3) are not necessarily rep-
resentable. The necessary and suﬃcient conditions of the ensemble repre-
sentability of 1-density operators was found by Coleman [1, 3] and may be
formulated as follows.

Theorem 1 (Coleman). 1-density operator ρ is representable by an ensem-
ble of p−electron states if and only if

(1)
(2)

(3)

ρ† = ρ;
0 ≤ ρ ≤ 1
pI;
T r ρ = 1.

(4)

Here I is the 1-electron identity operator.
Now let us turn to the algebraic version of the representability problem
conﬁning ourselves to the ﬁnite-dimensional case. We suppose that 1-electron
sector of the Fock space FN,1 is spanned by n = |N| orthonormal molecular
spin-orbitals (MSOs) {ψi}i∈N and that standard creation-annihilation opera-
tors are associated with this MSO basis set. The electronic space correspond-
p FN,1
ing to p−electron system is just the pth Grassmann power FN,p =
of the 1-electron space. Following Dirac, we identify the algebra of linear

V

of this space and the space of 1
operators is deﬁned as

(6)

Due to linearity of the contraction operator Eq.(6) is easily generalized to
treat ensembles of p-electron states. The set of all representable by ensembles
of p-electron states 1-density operators will be denoted by the symbol VN,p,1
and will be referred to as Coleman’s set. It is a compact (and, consequently,
closed) convex subset of the aﬃne hyperplane T r ρ = 1 situated in the
operator space FN,1 ⊗ F †
N,1. From Coleman’s theorem it readily follows that
the set VN,p,1 is invariant with respect to transformations u ⊗ u† where u ∈
U(FN,1) is 1-electron unitary operator (the so-called unitary invariance of
the representability problem). In other words, VN,p,1 is a U(FN,1)-space with
respect of 1-electron unitary group action (see, e.g. [13, 14]).

The structure of the set PN,p,1 of 1-density operators representable by
pure p-electron states is more complicated. It is the image of the projective
space P(FN,p) over the p-electron sector of the Fock space with respect to
p!cp−1. Since P(FN,p) is compact and connected space, its
the contraction 1
image with respect to continuous mapping (contraction) is also compact and
connected. In addition, projective spaces do not admit global parametriza-
tions being the simplest examples of the so-called analytic manifolds (see,
e.g., [11, 12]). It may therefore be expected that global parametrization does
not exist also for the set PN,p,1 as a whole.

In non-relativistic quantum chemistry molecular spin-orbitals are pre-
sented as (tensor) products of spatial and spin functions and it is normally
assumed that p-electron states under consideration have a ﬁxed projection
MS of the total spin. 1-electron sector of the Fock space can be decomposed
into a direct sum of its α- and β-subspaces and 1-density operator becomes
a direct sum of α- and β-components. There are two equivalent forms of
the representability conditions in this case. If the total 1-density operator is

written as ρ = ρα ⊕ ρβ then ρ is representable if and only if

If ρ is written as ρ = pα

Here Iσ is the identity operator in σ-subspace of 1-electron space, pσ is the
number of σ-electrons, and σ = α, β. In the second case ρσ ∈ VM,pσ,1 where
M is the orbital index set.

Each 1-density operator is Hermitian and can therefore be diagonalized
and its eigenfunctions (the so-called natural MSOs) constitute a basis of 1-
electron sector of the Fock space and without loss of generality this basis can
be considered to be orthonormal. In Dirac’s notations spectral resolution of
1-density operator ρ is

ρ =

λi|ψiihψi|

i∈N
X

where λi are the so-called natural occupancies. For 1-density operators of
the form of Eq.(9) Coleman’s theorem can be formulated as

Theorem 2 (Coleman). 1-density operator ρ presented as its spectral res-
olution is representable by an ensemble of p-electron states if and only if

In geometric terms for a ﬁxed n-frame ψ = (ψ1, . . . , ψn) (orthonormal

It is clear that for any ﬁxed n-frame ψ the polyhedron Vψ
N,p,1 is homeo-
morphic to the typical (standard) polyhedron VN,p,1 constituted by vectors
(λ1, . . . , λn) ∈ Rn satisfying the Coleman’s conditions (1)-(3) of Theorem 2.
Combinatorial structure of this polyhedron is outlined in Appendix A.

In terms of natural occupancies it is easy to describe the border of the set
VN,p,1: It is constituted by 1-density operators that have at least one natural
occupancy equal to zero or 1/p. For the border of VN,p,1 standard symbol
◦
∂VN,p,1 will be used. Interior part of VN,p,1 will be denoted as
VN,p,1. Note
that the minimal number of non-vanishing natural occupancies is equal to
the number of electrons p and, if it is the case, then all these occupancies are
equal to 1/p (single determinant density operators that can be considered as
vertices of VN,p,1).

Now we can describe two diﬀerent realizations of the set of ensemble rep-
resentable 1-density operators. In the ﬁrst realization n-frame ψ is supposed
to be ﬁxed and any representable density operator is written in the form

where matrix (ρij) satisﬁes conditions (1)-(3) of theorem 1. The set VN,p,1 is
the image of the mapping

r : (λ, u) → uλu†

(14)

(15)

where λ ∈ Vψ
N,p,1 and u is 1-electron unitary transformation. It is easy to
see that this mapping is not injective. In this realization VN,p,1 is a union
of orbits with respect to the unitary group action where for each orbit its
representative, diagonal in the basis ψ, is selected.

In the second realization the set of ensemble representable 1-density op-

erators is considered as a disjoint union (sum) of ﬁbres Vψ

manifold N as its base and the polyhedron VN,p,1 as its typical ﬁbre (see, e.g.,
[11, 12]). In such a realization the set of ensemble representable 1-density
operators is homeomorphic to the Cartesian product N × VN,p,1. 1-electron

The set of 1-density operators representable by pure p-electron states can

also be considered as a disjoint union of ﬁbres

where for each ψ ∈ N the ﬁbre Pψ

N,p,1 is a compact connected subset of Vψ

|ψiihψi|. An

example of explicit description of a ﬁbre Pψ
N,p,1 is given in Appendix B. It is
pertinent to note that implicitly ﬁbre bundles appeared in quantum chemistry
at its infancy in disguise of the so-called multi-conﬁguration self-consistent
ﬁeld (MCSCF) theory. MCSCF ﬁbre bundles have the set N of n-frames as

is possible to deﬁne the diagonal mapping

Deﬁnition 1. Vector λ ∈ Rn is called representable if it can be realized as a
diagonal of 1-density operator with respect to some ﬁxed basis.

It is easy to see that the diagonal mapping (20) commute with the con-
traction operator. This means, in particular, that the diagonal of any repre-
sentable 1-density operator is representable by an ensemble of determinant
states and dψ (VN,p,1) = Vψ
N,p,1. Of course, dψ(ρ) ∈ Vψ
N,p,1 does not imply
ρ ∈ VN,p,1. However, the following statement holds true.

Corollary.

dψ (PN,p,1) = Vψ

N,p,1

(23)

The connection between two aforementioned realizations of the set of the
ensemble representable 1-density operators is established by the following
simple assertion.
Proposition 2. (1) ρ ∈ VN,p,1 if and only if dψ(ρ) ∈ Vψ
ψ;

N,p,1 for any n-frame

(2) ρ ∈ ∂VN,p,1 if and only if there exists n-frame ψ such that dψ(ρ) ∈

(3) ρ ∈

VN,p,1 for any n-frame ψ.

Proof. Statement (1) readily follows from the Coleman’s theorem. As for
statement (2), it is suﬃcient to prove that dψ(ρ) ∈ ∂Vψ
N,p,1 implies ρ ∈ ∂VN,p,1.
Indeed, if ρ ∈ ∂VN,p,1 then in the basis ψ of natural MSOs dψ(ρ) ∈ ∂Vψ
N,p,1.
Let us suppose therefore that dψ(ρ) ∈ ∂Vψ
N,p,1 which means that ρii = 0
or ρii = 1
p in the MSO basis under consideration. If (Uji) is the matrix of
coeﬃcients of transformation from this basis to the basis of 1-density operator
ρ natural MSOs, then we have

ρii =

where λi are natural occupancies. If ρii = 0 then from this equality it follows
that there exists at least one index j such that λj = 0. If ρii = 1
p then this
equality may be recast as

Proposition 2 is not. In other words, the conditions (36) do not necessarily
ﬁlter out p−element subsets selected on the previous steps. This may be used
to construct expansions diﬀerent from the boundary ones. And even more,
it is easy to show that on the base of iteration formula (34) any pre-deﬁned
p-electron ensemble of determinant states may be obtained.

subsets from Ind(λ(0)) in some ﬁxed order R0, R1, . . . , Rkf and step by step
split vertices ﬁrst vp↓1(R0) from λ(0), then vp↓1(R1) from λ(1), etc, selecting
at each step a non-boundary value of parameter µRi. This procedure is
continued till the moment when on some step k the number of remaining

deﬁnes a basis independent linear representation of the set of 1-electron op-

‘1-electron operators acting on p-electron space’. More simple but basis de-
pendent deﬁnition of X(v) may be given in terms of the standard creation-
annihilation operators associated with some orthonormal MSO basis set.
Let H ∈ Hp be some ﬁxed operator over p−electron space and let

(42)

be the projector on the eigenspace W H

relation on the set H1:

1 (v) of operator H+X(v) corresponding
1 (v). Let us introduce the following equivalence

RH(v, v′) ⇔ P H

1 (v) = P H

1 (v′)

(43)

Quotient of H1 modulo the equivalence relation (43) contains classes of equiv-
alent 1-electron operators and the notation QH = H1/RH for the set of such
classes will be used. Class represented by some 1-electron operator v is de-
noted by the standard symbol [v]. The set of scalar operators is a subset of
the zero class [0] not necessarily coinciding with it.

If otherwise is not stated, the quotient topology is supposed to be ﬁxed
on the set QH. It is to be emphasize that the deﬁnition of the set QH in the
case of inﬁnite dimension should be modiﬁed to exclude 1-electron operators
v such that the discrete part of spectrum of the operators H + X(v) is empty.

is injective for any H ∈ Hp.

Proof. It is suﬃcient to prove that [v] 6= [v′] ⇒ iH ([v]) 6= iH ([v′]). Let
us suppose the contrary, that is [v] 6= [v′] but iH([v]) = iH ([v′]) = ρ. Since,
by deﬁnition, [v] 6= [v′] implies W H
1 (v′), it is possible to select
a pair of eigenfunctions Ψ1(v) ∈ W H
1 (v′) such that
Ψ1(v) 6∈ W H
1 (v). Now, following the original arguments
of Hohenberg and Kohn, we take into account that the quadratic functional
associated with any Hermitian operator, reaches its absolute minimum at
vectors belonging to the eigenspace of this operator corresponding to its
lowest eigenvalue. We have two inequalities

1 (v) and Ψ1(v′) ∈ W H

(cid:9)

Let us point out the main diﬀerences between the original Hohenberg-

Kohn statement [2, 10] and theorem 4:

(1) Theorem 4 states that the unique ensemble representable 1-density
operator (not just density) corresponds to a certain class of 1-electron oper-
ators, but not vice versa;

(2) This theorem is valid for arbitrary choice of operator H that can be,

in particular, arbitrary 1-electron, or even zero operator;

(3) It is not presupposed that the mapping iH is continuous (with respect

to the quotient topology on QH and the standard topology on VN,p,1).

Note as well that the statement analogous to that in Theorem 4 holds
true for the set Hq of q−electron operators (q < p) with obvious replacement
of 1
in Eq.(44) by an ensemble representable density operator
q!
p!cp−q
of order q. This generalization, however, is of no particular

interest because the structure of the set VN,p,q of ensemble representable
density operators of order q is unknown for q > 1.

It is easy to show that in general case the image of the mapping (44)
does not coincide with the set VN,p,1 being only its proper subset. Indeed, let
us suppose that the following auspicious conditions hold true (i) classes of
1-electron operators from H1 can be continuously parametrized by free real
parameters t = (t1, t2, . . . , tk) ∈ Rk:

[v(t)] = {aIn + v(t)}a∈R

(45)

(In is 1-electron identity operator), and (ii) the mapping t → P H
1 ([v(t)])
(see Eq.(42)) is continuous (and, consequently, the mapping (44) is also con-
tinuous). Even under such conditions the image of the mapping (44) is an
open subset of the compact set VN,p,1. It is pertinent to note as well that
the mapping (44) is not necessarily continuous for arbitrary H. The simplest
example corresponds to the case H = 0 where the quotient set QH is discrete.
In the ﬁnite dimensional case the operator space H1 admits (in full anal-
ogy with the set of representable 1-density operators, see Section II) at least
two convenient realizations. In the ﬁrst, standard, realization the MSO or-
thonormal basis ψ is supposed to be ﬁxed and the operator space H1 coincides
with the set of all unitary transformed operators that are diagonal in the ba-
sis under consideration. In the second realization a sum (disjoint union) of
ﬁbres isomorphic to the typical ﬁbre Rn is considered:

H1 =

Hψ
1

ψ∈N
G

e

(46)

where Hψ
1 is the set of 1-electron operators diagonal in the basis ψ. It is clear
H1 → H1. Of course, in the
that there exists natural surjective mapping
last realization the same 1-electron operator may appear on diﬀerent ﬁbres
(for example, the 1-electron identity belongs to each ﬁbre). This drawback
it is
is partially compensated by the relative simplicity of
homeomorphic to the Cartesian product the manifold N of all n-frames of
1-electron space (base) and the typical ﬁbre Rn. The set
H1 is called a total
e
space of a (trivial) ﬁbre bundle with the manifold N as its base, Hψ
1 as a
ﬁbre over point ψ, and Rn as the typical ﬁbre.

H1 structure:

In analogy with 1-electron operators, for each n-frame ψ operator H
has basis dependent realization Hψ with respect to the determinant basis

and even in more strong form: since 1-electron term T r[ρv] = T r[dψ(ρ)v]
in average energy involves diagonal of representable 1-density operator, it is
possible to prove that the mapping dψ ◦ ˜iH is injective for any ψ.

Thus, we can formulate the algebraic version of the Hohenberg-Kohn

statement as

Theorem 5. The mapping d ◦ ˜iH = {dψ ◦ ˜iH}ψ∈N is a ﬁbrewise injective
mapping of the ﬁbre bundle

QH into the ﬁbre bundle

(54)

[v(t)]ψ =

aIn +

tj|ψjihψj|

(

)a∈R

20

It is clear that this set of classes Qψ
H is homeomorphic to Rn−1 and each class is
homeomorphic to R. If we suppose that the projector on the ground state of
the operator H + X(v(t)) depends continuously on parameters t1, t2, . . . , tn−1
then the image of the ﬁbre Qψ
H is an open subset in VN,p,1 (or even in PN,p,1
if the lowest eigenvalue of the parametric operator H + X(v(t)) is non-
degenerate for all t). This means that with the class structure deﬁned by
Eq.(54) the image ˜iH(Qψ
H) can not contain 1-density operators from the bor-
der of VN,p,1 (or PN,p,1). All aforementioned arguments are applicable only
if the ground state projector of operator H + X([v]ψ) is continuous (with
respect to the quotient topology on Qψ
H ). And between these two bound-
ary cases there exists a variety of ’intermediate’ ones with more complicated
structure of sets of classes.

Parametrization of the set of classes deﬁned by Eq.(54) is by no means
unique. Sometimes it is convenient, for example, to impose the additional
requirement of orthogonality of the parametric representative of class [v(t)]ψ
to the identity operator (say, with respect to the trace scalar product). It
may be easily done by writing class [v(t)]ψ in the form

n

[v(t)]ψ =

aIn +

(55)

)a∈R

with the additional condition

tj = 0. Concrete examples of diﬀerent

parametrizations will be given later.

Now let us turn to more detailed analysis of the ’diagonal’ version of
the Hohenberg-Kohn statement and consider the mapping dψ ◦ ˜iH : Qψ
H →
Vψ
N,p,1 for some ﬁxed n-frame ψ. It will be supposed that matrix Hψ of p-
electron operator H has non-degenerate ground state. Parametric matrix
Hψ + X
either has non-degenerate ground state for all ﬁnite values
of parameters, or there are points in the parameter space where the ground
state is degenerate, or quasi-degenerate. In strictly degenerate case, due to
Theorem 5, the mapping ˜iH should have discontinuity when going from pure
to averaged 1-density diagonal.

vψ(t)

It should be specially emphasized that the structure of classes from Qψ
H
depends on the properties of representable diagonal dψ(ρ) of 1-density oper-
ator ρ corresponding to the ground state of operator H. In particular, this

(cid:1)

(cid:0)

21

structure is diﬀerent for dψ(ρ) ∈

◦
N,p,1 and dψ(ρ) ∈ ∂Vψ
Vψ

N,p,1. Indeed, let

ρii =

where I ∩ J = ∅. This means (see Appendix A) that dψ(ρ) belongs to the
(I, J)-face of the polyhedron Vψ
N,p,1 of dimension n − |I| − |J| − 1. Ground
state wave function Ψ1 of matrix Hψ corresponds of 1-density operator with
diagonal elements satisfying conditions (56) if it is orthogonal to subspace
spanned by p-electron basis determinants |Ri such that either R ∩ I 6= ∅ or
R ∩ J = ∅, and arbitrary matrix of the form

(i) the parametric term on the right hand side of Eq.(57) is 1-electron

Let us consider an example formally corresponding to 2-electron case:

N = {1, 2, 3, 4} and p = 2.

For a ﬁxed 4-frame ψ = (ψ1, ψ2, ψ3, ψ4) general two-electron wave function

Ψ = aψ1 ∧ ψ2 + bψ1 ∧ ψ3 + cψ1 ∧ ψ4 + dψ2 ∧ ψ3 + eψ2 ∧ ψ4 + f ψ3 ∧ ψ4 (58)

Diagonal of 1-density operator ρ corresponding to this wave function is

dψ(ρ) =

(a2 + b2 + c2, a2 + d2 + e2, b2 + d2 + f 2, c2 + e2 + f 2)

An example of behavior of diagonal elements of 1-density operators along
one of basis directions in the parameter space is displayed on Figs.1. It is
seen that these elements are smooth functions along the selected direction
and that the mapping z → (ρ11(0, 0, z), ρ22(0, 0, z), ρ33(0, 0, z), ρ44(0, 0, z)) is
injective. It may be expected that each representable diagonal corresponds
to the unique set of parameters, and, consequently, to the unique class of

It may be
a union of cells of diﬀerent dimensions as it was in the last two examples,
and use of general parametric classes of the type of Eq.(55) for both interior

sentable diagonal of 1-density operator, corresponding to the ground state

Till now we studied in a certain sense local task of parametrization of
representable diagonals by classes of diagonal 1-electron operators from a
given ﬁbre Hψ
1 . The next very important step is to assemble local results.

27

Since the ﬁbre bundles under consideration are trivial (that is not twisted,
in contrast to, say, the famous M¨obius band), this task, in theory, is not
complicated. Choosing any convenient (local) parametrization of the base
N (dim N = n(n − 1)/2 if the ground number ﬁeld is R), we come to 1-
density diagonals depending on two independent sets of parameters. The
ﬁrst set parametrizes some open subset of the base N and the second set
parametrizes classes of diagonal 1-electron operators.

Now let us consider the case when for each n-frame ψ the structure of
classes of 1-electron operators from Hψ
1 is given by Eq.(55) without explicit
reference to any concrete p-electron operator H. Each ﬁbre Qψ (subscript
H is omitted because of the aforementioned reason) is (n − 1)-dimensional
vector space over R with respect to the operations

[v(t)]ψ + [v(t′)]ψ = [v(t + t′)]ψ, α[v(t)]ψ = [v(αt)]ψ, α ∈ R

(71)

Q together with the vector space structure
and the corresponding ﬁbre bundle
on each ﬁbre is the so-called vector bundle [11]. The following problem seems
to be of primary interest for the DFT theory:

In concluding this section let us discuss in general form the universal
functionals of the DFT theory (see [8, 10] and references therein). Relevant
deﬁnitions and theorems from set-theoretical topology may be found in [17].
Let us suppose that

γ : P(FN,p) → T

(74)

is a continuous surjective mapping of the (projective) space of states on a
Hausdorﬀ topological space T. Being the image of the compact set P(FN,p)

with respect to continuous mapping, T is also compact. Let Rγ be the equiv-
alence relation associated with the mapping γ:

Rγ(x, y) ⇔ γ(x) = γ(y)

The quotient P(FN,p)/Rγ is necessarily Hausdorﬀ and compact space (in quo-
tient topology) and, consequently, the mapping γ admits representation in
the form γ = g ◦π where π is the canonical projection P(FN,p) → P(FN,p)/Rγ
and g is the homeomorphism P(FN,p)/Rγ → T. The average energy
EH = hΨ|H|Ψi is a smooth mapping P(FN,p) → R. Of course, this mapping
is not compatible with the equivalence relation Rγ. But it is possible to
introduce a new mapping

involving derivatives and variations of universal functionals, require certain
care.

Let us suppose that the set PN,p,1 is realized as a ﬁbre bundle (19) and
consider simple example: N = {1, 2, 3, 4} and p = 2 (see Appendix B). In
this case there are three branches of universal functional associated with
three pairs of disjoint subsets: FR,N \R(λ; ψ). If 2-electron operator H (1)
ψ (see
Appendix C) is chosen, then the ground state branch corresponds to the pair
(12, 34) (it is suﬃcient to ﬁnd the ground state 1-density operator and then
perform transformation to the natural MSO basis to see that in this basis
Ψ(1)
1 = 0.944996|12i − 0.327082|34i). Dependence of 3 branches of the the
universal functional on the parameter τ (see Appendix B, Eq.(B.2)) on the
ﬁbre Pψ
N,2,1, corresponding to the ground state natural 4-frame ψ, is displayed
on Fig. 4. In the case under consideration these branches are just segments
of three ellipses.

V. Conclusion

Any ﬁnite dimensional model of quantum mechanics is in a certain sense
incomplete, because it does not include many important relations like com-
mutation relations of canonically conjugate pairs of observables which exist
only in inﬁnite dimension. On the other hand, in the majority of cases molec-
ular calculations are performed in ﬁnite basis sets, and it seems reasonable
to try to ﬁnd out what speciﬁc ﬁnite dimensional features are inherent in
algebraic version of quantum chemistry methods. Thorough analysis of the
algebraic version of the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem for arbitrary selected many
electron operator H shows that

- structure of classes of 1-electron operators that appear in the Hohenberg-
Kohn theorem may be very complicated and may be determined not only
by operator H ground state but also by spectrum of a certain auxiliary
parametric many electron operator; this structure strongly depends on the
properties of the operator H ground state 1-density operator ρ and is diﬀerent
for ρ belonging to the border of the Coleman’s set and to its interior part;

- if ρ belongs to the interior part of the Coleman’s set (all MSO’s are nec-
essarily active) then there exist many electron operators such that the corre-
sponding classes of 1-electron operators are of general form {aIn + v(t)}a∈R;
in this case the Hohenberg-Kohn mapping may parametrize the interior part
of the Coleman’s set but its image can not contain, say, vertices of this set

30

(HF 1-density operators);

operator H;

- the Hohenberg-Kohn mapping is not necessarily continuous for arbitrary

- in ﬁnite dimensional case fundamental role is played not by densities

but by representable diagonals of 1-density operators;

- the set of 1-density operators representable by pure states, in general,
does not admit global parametrization and there may exist several branches
of DFT universal functionals.

General theory developed in this work does not impose any special re-
strictions on many electron operator H. However, in all examples considered
it was assumed that the ground state of this operator is non-degenerate. De-
generate case may introduce additional complications in concrete structure
of classes of 1-electron operators and requires separate investigation.

Appendix A: Combinatorial Structure of Polyhedron VN,p,1

Polyhedron VN,p,1 is situated in the (aﬃne) hyperplane

of the vector space Rn that has the vector

(A.1)

To describe faces of the polyhedron VN,p,1 it is necessary to analyze ’mixed’
families {{ei}i∈I, {a − pej}j∈J, a} with I ∩ J = ∅. Two obvious restrictions

should be imposed on disjoint subsets I and J: 0 ≤ |I| ≤ n − p and 0 ≤
|J| ≤ p. Indeed, if |I| > n − p then the number of non-vanishing components
of vector λ ∈ VN,p,1 is less than p and consequently, ha|λi < 1. If |J| > p
then the number of components of vector λ ∈ VN,p,1 equal to 1
p is greater
than p and, consequently, ha|λi > 1. Direct calculation shows that a family
{{ei}i∈I, {a −pej}j∈J, a} is free if and only if I ∩J = ∅ and |I ∪J| < n. Thus,
faces of the polyhedron VN,p,1 are the sets FI,J of solutions of the systems:

Let I, J be subsets of the index set N, such that I ∩J = ∅, |I ∪J| ≤ n−1,
0 ≤ |I| ≤ n − p, 0 ≤ |J| ≤ p, and let K = N\(I ∪ J). Let us put |I ∪ J| = r
and |J| = p −s. Admissible values of r are 1, 2, . . . , n−1. For ﬁxed value of r
the admissible values of |J| are min{r, p}, min{r, p}−1, . . . , max{0, r−n+p}.
If λ ∈ FI,J then the following equality holds true

This equality can be recast in a more convenient form:

where s = max{p − r, 0}, max{p − r, 0} + 1, . . . , min{p, n − r}. There are
three cases to be analyzed.

(1) s = max{p − r, 0} = 0.
In this case Eq.(A.6) has only trivial solution λk = 0, k ∈ K. The

corresponding face FI,J is just the vertex vp↓1(J) (0-face).

(2) s 6= 0 and |K| ≥ s + 1.
The set of solutions of Eq.(A.6) is non-degenerate Coleman’s polyhedron
VK,s,1 of the dimension |K| − 1 and, consequently, (|K| − 1)-face of the

polyhedron VN,p,1.

{ s

Appendix B: An Example of Geometric Description of the Set

of 1-Density Operators Representable by Pure States

Let us consider general two-electron wave function of the form of Eq.(58)
The corresponding pure state |ΨihΨ| belongs to the projective space P(FN,2).
We conﬁne our consideration to the case when the ground number ﬁeld is R,
and the projective space can be realized as a quotient of the 5-dimensional
unit sphere S5 formed by pairs of diametrically opposite points.

Let us suppose that 1-density matrix (B.1) is diagonal in the basis under con-
sideration. We have the system of 6 polynomial equations with respect to
variables a, b, c, d, e, f that can be easily solved with the aid of MATHEMAT-
ICA built-in Reduce function [15]. For each pair of 2-electron determinants
with disjoint index sets there is a solution

ρ(R, N\R) = τ v2↓1(R) + (1 − τ )v2↓1(N\R)

(B.2)

where R is 2-element subset of the index set N.

Using iteration formula (34) it is possible to construct inﬁnitely many
(for τ 6= 0, 1) 2-electron determinant ensembles contracted in diagonal (B.2).
The corresponding pure states (see Proposition 1), however, give diagonal
1-density operators (over R) only if

N,2,1 over point ψ consists of 1-density
operators of the type of Eq.(B.2). The number of diﬀerent types of such

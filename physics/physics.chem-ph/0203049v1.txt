Non-adiabatic coupling and adiabatic population transfer

We show that a counter-intuitive pulse sequence leads to adiabatic passage between the vibrational
levels of three harmonic potentials through parallel dark states in adiabatic approximation. However,
the adiabatic assumptions break down for very intense pulses and non-adiabatic couplings result in
the population transfer by light-induced potential shaping.

PACS numbers: 33.80.-b, 42.50.-p

Population transfer by shaping light induced potentials
(LIP) is a very robust scheme to transfer vibrational pop-
ulation between diﬀerent electronic potentials in diatomic
molecules [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. One of the main advantages
of the scheme is that the vibrational quantum number
is conserved during the overall process. Since the selec-
tivity of the transfer is guaranteed by a symmetry rule,
the method is not very sensitive to the exact position of
the energy resonance, i.e. to the topological or energetic
features of the potentials involved.

The simplest scenario of population transfer by shap-
ing LIP can be described in terms of three electronic
states (potential curves) sequentially coupled by two
laser pulses, and the vibrational population is driven by
two photon oﬀ resonant absorption. Although there are
several possible scenarios for selective population trans-
fer [1, 7], the ﬁrst scheme proposed, called APLIP, in-
volves a sequence of two very strong (TW/cm2) picosec-
ond pulses applied in counter-intuitive order [5]. The
pulse that couples the intermediate electronic state with
the ﬁnal excited electronic state must precede the pulse
that couples the ground electronic state with the inter-
mediate one. Then the system dynamics follows a char-
acteristic pattern in the vibrational basis representation,
which is illustrated in Fig. 1 for a test system of three
harmonic oscillators with the same force constant. (More
details about the model are presented below.) According
to Fig. 1(a), the overall population on the ground elec-
tronic state is rapidly transferred to the ﬁnal electronic
state, while very few population is temporally excited to
the intermediate electronic state. So, in principal it is
possible to suppose there is a dark state consisting of
the initial and ﬁnal potentials, similar to the population
transfer through the dark state of the three-level system
[8]. Looking into the vibrational populations in detail, it
can be seen that the passage is mediated by substantial
excitation of high energy vibrational levels in both initial
and ﬁnal potentials, Fig.1(b).

The scenario previously considered is very similar to
the well known Stimulated Raman Adiabatic Passage
(STIRAP) scheme [8]. In STIRAP there are three levels
sequentially coupled by two ﬁelds working in counter-

intuitive order. This arrangement of pulses prepares the
system initially in a dark state,
, which is an eigen-
state of the Hamiltonian dressed by the ﬁeld in the adi-
abatic approximation. The dark state correlates at late
and never overlaps with the
3
times with the ﬁnal level

intermediate level. The population is transferred from
1
i
|
to
in a completely similar way to the overall electronic
populations of Fig. 1(a).

Normally, the STIRAP scheme involves nanosecond (or
longer) pulses with intensities in the GW/cm2 (or less).
Therefore it is natural to ask if APLIP is a short time,
strong ﬁeld version of STIRAP (and applied to electronic
states instead of vibrational or atomic levels). Indeed the
requirement of stronger laser ﬁelds can be understood un-

der the general assumptions of STIRAP. Since the adi-
abaticity condition in STIRAP is usually expressed by
1, where Ω is the eﬀective
the pulse area relation, Ωτ
≫
Rabi frequency of the pulses and τ their time widths, any
reduction in the pulse width must imply a correspond-
ing increase in the pulse amplitude. Nevertheless, in this
note we show that the population transfer in APLIP can
not be reduced to the generalized description of STIRAP
in multi-level system.
In order to do so we show that
the natural extension of STIRAP to the three potential
curves scenario in the strong ﬁeld limit predicts a diﬀer-
ent dynamical evolution than the one shown in Fig. 1.

Let us consider in detail the Hamiltonian of the system.
The Hamiltonian for three electronic potentials (Vi(x),
i = 1, 2, 3) coupled by two laser ﬁelds (E1(t) and E2(t)) in
the Born Oppenheimer and rotating wave approximation
(RWA) reads

ω2, ωi being the car-
−
rier frequencies of the lasers), µ12(x) and µ23(x) are
the dipole moments (atomic units are used through-
out).
In this representation the global wave func-
tion of the system is expanded in terms of electronic
wave functions,
, and vibrational wave packets,
, where q is an index representing the collective

electron coordinates and x is the vibrational coordinate.

In order to compare the dynamics of the general sys-
tem with that of STIRAP, we establish a correspondence
N equations of motion (Eq. (3)) and
between the 3
the equations for N 3-level ladder systems, where both
diabatic and adiabatic states are known, corresponding
to that of the STIRAP Hamiltonian. In doing this con-
nection we neglect all the contributions from the con-
tinuum wave functions in all the electronic states. To
simplify the notation we use a model of three symmet-
rically displaced harmonic oscillators (Fig. 2) with the
same force constant (SDHO model), so that the sep-
aration between the minima of the potentials is con-
stant, r(3)

the equilibrium conﬁgurations of the excited potentials
are displaced to larger inter nuclei distances. Further-

Ei(t) = E0S(t), with E0 = 0.08 a.u. and S(t) being a
Gaussian envelope function. Both pulses have the same
envelope function, with width σ = 2.5 ps and they are
time delayed, so that the second pulse precedes in 2.5 ps
the ﬁrst pulse. To obtain the numerical results shown in
Fig. 1 we have numerically integrated the TDSE based on
a grid discretization of the Hamiltonian in Eq. (1) and not
on the discrete basis representation of Eq. (4). Details of
the numerical propagator are given in reference [2].

Equations (9), and (10) separate the molecular contri-
bution (geometrical factors) from the pulse contribution
(depending on the pulse amplitude). However it can be
seen that the APLIP dynamic behavior cannot stem from
these terms. For instance, in the model of symmetri-
cally displaced harmonic oscillators the symmetry of the
12 = p23
system imposes that p12

is indeed the adiabatic state whose evolution reproduces
exactly the STIRAP behavior independently from the
detuning or intensity of the pulses.

Increasing the number of vibrational levels in the ex-
pansion (Eq. (2)) does not introduce any diﬀerent type
of couplings and the same conclusions apply. It is very
simple to generalize the expression for the general 3N -

Hamiltonian of Eq.(1)), in which many of high energy
vibrational levels of the ground and ﬁnal potentials are
considerably populated (Fig. 1(b)). Although the ana-

lytic proof derived in this paper is valid for a speciﬁc
“ideal” system, the SDHO model, of course any small
asymmetry in the model cannot explain the clear dif-
ference in behavior of STIRAP and APLIP. The diﬀer-
ence, therefore, must stem from a diﬀerent source. The
validity of the quasi-adiabatic Hamiltonian rests upon
the adiabatic approximation, that is, the neglect of the

large Ω0 and detuning, the APLIP dynamics shows that
the contribution of these terms cannot be neglected. This
is in agreement with the numerical results obtained for
population transfer by shaping LIPs in more general sce-
narios [3, 6].

Abstract

Recent developments in molecular theories and simulation of ions and po-
lar molecules in water are reviewed. The hydration of imidazole and imida-
zolium solutes is used to exemplify the theoretical issues. The treatment of
long-ranged electrostatic interactions in simulations is discussed extensively.
It is argued that the Ewald approach is an easy way to get correct hydra-
tion free energies in the thermodynamic limit from molecular calculations;
and that molecular simulations with Ewald interactions and periodic bound-
ary conditions can also be more eﬃcient than many common alternatives.
The Ewald treatment permits a conclusive extrapolation to inﬁnite system
size. Accurate results for well-deﬁned models have permitted careful testing
of simple theories of electrostatic hydration free energies, such as dielectric
continuum models. The picture that emerges from such testing is that the
most prominent failings of the simplest theories are associated with solvent
proton conformations that lead to non-gaussian ﬂuctuations of electrostatic
potentials. Thus, the most favorable cases for the second-order perturbation
theories are monoatomic positive ions. For polar and anionic solutes, contin-
uum or gaussian theories are less accurate. The appreciation of the speciﬁc
deﬁciencies of those simple models have led to new concepts, multistate gaus-
sian and quasi-chemical theories, that address the cases for which the simpler
theories fail. It is argued that, relative to direct dielectric continuum treat-
ments, the quasi-chemical theories provide a better theoretical organization
for the computational study of the electronic structure of solution species.

1. Introduction

Water, the most commonly encountered liquid, exerts both chemical and physical inﬂu-
ences on aqueous molecular processes. Hydration eﬀects are often divided into hydrophobic
and hydrophilic categories. Hydrophilic solutes are typically ionic or polar species and may
participate in chemical interactions with the water solvent. Because of the long range of the
electrostatic interactions and their strength relative to kBT , hydrophilic hydration presents
distinctive conceptual and practical issues for understanding and predicting the inﬂuence of
hydration on chemical and biochemical events in water.

A principal and long-standing technical issue is the treatment of inﬁnitely long-ranged
interactions in the context of a sample of ﬁnite size.1 Recent work has helped to resolve this
problem. One algorithmic approach to treatment of long-ranged interactions is the use of
Ewald interactions within the conventional periodic boundary conditions.2 We argue here
that the Ewald approach is an easy way to get correct hydration free energies from molecular
calculations, that is, to achieve well characterized results appropriate to the thermodynamic
limit in which the system size tends to inﬁnity for given densities and temperature. What
is more: molecular simulations with Ewald interactions and periodic boundary conditions
can also be more eﬃcient than rougher approximations that are often employed to compute
hydration free energies for molecularly well-deﬁned problems. We anticipate results below by
noting that we obtain accurate, thermodynamic limiting results for the hydration free energy
of imidazole with as few as 16 water molecules included in the simulation. The price to be
paid for this accuracy and eﬃciency is additional eﬀort in understanding Ewald calculations
from a physical viewpoint and in implementing Ewald interactions,2 its equivalents,3–7 and
alternatives.8–10

The physical issues motivating simulation calculations of this type revolve around dielec-
tric continuum models of hydration of ionic and polar solutes.11 It is natural and common for
a simpliﬁed approximation to provide a conceptual baseline for considering more accurate
theoretical results. But the converse comparison is foremost for this work. The theoretical
eﬀorts over recent years have provided sharper tests of the validity of the continuum ap-
proach than merely: is an empirically correct hydration free energy obtained? Recent work
has clariﬁed that the dielectric models are simple implementations of thermodynamic per-
turbation theory through second-order in electrostatic coupling parameters such as solute
charges;12–14 dielectric models can also be considered a simple implementation of an ansatz
that electrostatic potential ﬂuctuations are distributed according to a gaussian probability
density,15 or they can be considered a simpliﬁed linear response theory.16–18

Second-order perturbation theory was found to be satisfactory for some solutes such as
alkali ions,14 but unsatisfactory for water13,19 and anions.14 In the latter cases, of course, an a
posteriori adjustment of cavity radii could still produce the correct hydration free energies.20
However, the more ambitious molecular theory ties the values of radii parameters to molecu-
lar properties that depend on the thermodynamic state of the system (temperature, pressure,
and composition of the solvent) and to non-electrostatic characteristics of the solute-solvent
interactions. The radii are not separately adjustable when viewed from that deeper level
of molecular theory. However, the radii can be well-deﬁned and are not properties of the
solutes alone but incorporate information about the solvent and thermodynamic state.

For water as a solvent, the case of exclusive concern here, the most prominent failings
of second-order perturbation theory are associated with solvent proton conformations that

3

lead to non-gaussian ﬂuctuations of electrostatic potentials.14,21 Thus, the most favorable
cases for the second-order perturbation theories are classic positive ions.
In such cases,
oxygen-hydrogen bonds of water are oriented away from the ion. Neutral, polar molecules
with speciﬁc hydrogen-bond acceptors are more challenging for these theories, though the
hydration free energies sought are smaller in magnitude than for typical ions. Negative
molecular ions are expected to oﬀer further complications because now the problematic
proton interactions with the solute will be strong. However, we have less experience with
realistic negative ions partly because the molecular models used for simulation are less well
developed than for other cases.

The appreciation of the diﬀerent possibilities for ﬂuctuations has led to new theories
of electrostatic hydration free energies.21 These theories analyze electrostatic distributions
more broadly, still using gaussian models at crucial steps; but now several gaussian distri-
butions are derived from an analysis of the ﬁrst shell environment of the solute. For the
important case of hydration of a water molecule, this extension repairs the breakdown of
a single gaussian theory. Negative ions can still be problematic but the multiple gaussian
approach has also motivated development of quasi-chemical theories22 that are based, in
principle, on full information about the thermal motion of the ﬁrst hydration shell. Though
experience with the quasi-chemical theories is limited,23 we anticipate that they should pro-
vide better descriptions of the hydration free energies, in addition to providing a reasonable
pathway to carry-out solution phase electronic structure calculations on hydrated negative
ions, calculations that would be diﬃcult particularly in the absence of hydration eﬀects.

In the following section, we will ﬁrst introduce the model solute imidazole, which was cho-
sen as a molecular solute to exemplify, combine, and extend aspects of ionic and polar solutes
studied previously.12–14,21,24 Results for imidazole and imidazolium will be used throughout
the manuscript to illustrate the theoretical issues. We will discuss the Ewald treatment of
electrostatic interactions, motivating it in various ways. Subsequently, ﬁnite-size eﬀects will
be studied. The correction for the typically large ﬁnite-size eﬀects is essential for accurate
calculations of solvation free energies of polar and charged solutes. We distinguish between
electrostatic ﬁnite-size eﬀects that are independent of the thermodynamic state and the
characteristics of the solute, and the remaining thermodynamic ﬁnite-size eﬀects. We will
then introduce perturbative methods for calculating solvation free energies that are based
on the approximately gaussian character of the electrostatic potential ﬂuctuations. Non-
gaussian behavior and its accurate treatment using multistate gaussian and quasi-chemical
models will be the focus of the last section.

2. Example: Imidazole and Imidazolium in Water

To illustrate the various issues arising in calculations of solvation free energies of charged
and polar molecules, we present new calculations of the hydration of imidazole and imida-
zolium. We choose this example because recent interest in these problems has focused on
predicting acid-base equilibria of biochemical relevance.25–31 We will calculate the charging
free energies of the protonated imidazolium and the neutral, polar imidazole (Figure 1).
Imidazole in water provides a rich example: the polar imidazole molecule can be protonated
at the N3 position to form a molecular cation, imidazolium. This protonation reaction
has a pKa of about 7.32 It provides a basis for pKa calculations of ionizable residues of
proteins.25–31 Imidazole is the building block of histidine, one of the most active amino

4

acids enzymatically and ubiquitous in the active sites of enzymes that operate at room
temperature and neutral pH.33

The protonation of imidazole has been studied previously using combinations of dielec-
tric, quantum mechanical, and computer simulation methods.34–38 Here, we will focus on the
solvation contribution to the protonation equilibrium and neglect the intramolecular eﬀects
that require a quantum mechanical treatment.

The imidazole/imidazolium system is more complex than the systems we have studied
before using explicit solvent models: mono- and divalent ions,14,21 water in water,13 and
tetramethylammonium.24 The analysis below should also illustrate how the calculation of
solvation free energies using the Ewald method and equilibrium ﬂuctuations of electrostatic
potentials can be extended to proteins, in particular the calculation of pKa’s of amino acids.
Monte Carlo computer simulations of imidazole in water. We studied the sol-
vation of imidazole [Im(p)] and imidazolium [Im(+)] in water using Monte Carlo (MC)
simulations in the canonical ensemble. For the Im(p) and Im(+) molecules, we used the
partial charges and geometry of Topol et al.,36 as compiled in Table I. For water, we used
the SPC/E model.40 The temperature was 298 K. The Ewald method was used for the
long-range electrostatic interactions with a real-space screening factor of η = 5.6/L, where
L is the length of the periodically replicated cubic box. A cutoﬀ of k2 ≤ 38(2π/L)2 was
applied in Fourier space, resulting in 2 × 510 k vectors being considered. A cutoﬀ of L/2
was applied to the Lennard-Jones and real-space electrostatic interactions based on atoms.
The background dielectric constant in the Ewald method was corrected from inﬁnity to 80.41
The partial molar volume of the imidazole was chosen as two times that of bulk water at a
density of 997.07 kg/m3, such that the pressure42 was about one atmosphere.

The Metropolis MC method was used to sample conﬁgurational space in the
simulations.43 The translational and rotational move widths of water were chosen to give
about 40 % acceptance ratios. The solute was allowed to move as well. Simulations started
from random conﬁgurations or conﬁgurations of previous runs with diﬀerent charges, equi-
librated for at least 100,000 and 50,000 MC passes, respectively, where one pass is one
attempted move for each of the particles. Electrostatic potentials at solute atom positions
and binding energies of the solute were calculated after every pass using the Ewald method
in simulations extending over 200,000 MC passes each. Simulations were performed for
the uncharged, half-charged, and fully charged Im(p) and Im(+) in their respective geome-
tries. The equilibrium simulations were performed with 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, and 512 water
molecules to study ﬁnite size eﬀects.

To complete the thermodynamic cycle and check for consistency, two runs of slow growth
thermodynamic integration were used to calculate the free energy of converting the geometry
from the uncharged Im(p) to the uncharged Im(+) conformation within 150,000 MC passes.
Six runs of 200,000 MC passes were used to calculate the free energy of converting the polar
Im(p) into an Im(+) cation, starting from diﬀerent equilibrated conﬁgurations and averaging
three charging and three uncharging runs. The thermodynamic integrations were carried
out with 256 water molecules.

We will discuss the results of these calculations as they come-up in the theoretical narra-
tive. However, before considering more subtle issues we can make a direct comparison of the
average electrostatic potential exerted by the solvent observed during the simulation with
the corresponding predictions of dielectric models. Figures 2 and 3 shows that comparison

for several sets of radii in current use. Such a comparison illustrates the basic issue of sen-
sitivity of thermodynamic results to the radii parameters and whether extant empirically
adjusted radii are transferable to slightly diﬀerent cases.

3. Noteworthy Aspects of the Ewald Treatment of Electrostatic Interactions

Viewed from an historical perspective, the most appropriate treatment of electrostatic

helpful to note some broad, and non-technical, characteristics of Ewald treatments that
might be typically overlooked. We preface these observations by noting that simulation
calculations treat ﬁnite systems. Most commonly, periodic (or Born-von Karman) boundary
conditions47,48 are utilized for the exterior boundary of the ﬁnite system considered. The
theoretical issues engendered by these boundary conditions with ﬁnite-ranged49,50 and long-
ranged interactions are reasonably well understood. Of course, simulation calculations need
not address issues of what is happening outside the simulation cell. We note that it is possible
to compute the Ewald potential – and in more than one way – without consideration of image
charges outside the simulation cell. So intuitive arguments based upon image charges can
be avoided completely.

It is convenient to express the Ewald electrostatic energy of a system of partial charges

In the following, we will separate the Coulomb energy Uel of the solute from the total

The ﬁrst, second, and third sum are the direct interactions with water, the interactions of
charges on the solute with other solute charges, and the self-interactions of solute charges,
respectively.

The Ewald potential ϕ(r) is the solution of the Poisson equation that is peri-
odic with the fundamental period of the simulation cell.14,51,53,55 A periodic solution
of the Poisson equation requires that the surface integral of the electric ﬁeld normal to the
surface of the simulation cell be zero. This means that the material in the simulation cell
must have zero net electric charge. If the physical system of interest is non-neutral, a uni-
form background distribution of charge is included to neutralize the non-zero charge of the
physical system.

Consider an elementary charge. Because the Ewald potential is periodic, we can consider
the Ewald electrostatic potential implied by centering the simulation cell on this elementary
charge. By symmetry the Ewald normal electric ﬁeld is zero on the cell boundary. The
Ewald potential can thus be considered to be that of a cut-oﬀ on the cell boundary – the
cut-oﬀ at the maximum distances achievable – with zero normal derivative analogous to a
shifted-force correction.

The Ewald potential pushes the electrostatic boundary outward as far as
possible but still retains smoothness on the boundary. The minimum image cut-oﬀ
shares with the Ewald treatment the property that the electrostatic potential is not cut-oﬀ in
any region of the simulation volume, the largest volume that must be physically considered.
However, as demonstrated above, the Ewald potential is smooth on that boundary since it is
the periodic solution of the Poisson equation. This is an important technical advantage that
facilitates investigation of system size dependence of computed properties, i.e., the variation
of system properties with variations of the cell boundaries. In those cases where the physical
system of interest is non-neutral it is a helpful point of view that the background charge
density is a simple device that permits smoothness of the computed potential on the system
boundary. We emphasize that the eﬀect of the neutralizing background charge disappears as
the thermodynamic limit is approached, in which the background charge density disappears.

Reaction ﬁeld potentials are Ewald potentials for diﬀerent background
charges. Reaction ﬁeld methods8,9,56,10 are computationally eﬃcient alternatives to Ewald
summation. The eﬀective potentials of the site-site reaction ﬁeld (SSRF) method9 and the
generalized reaction ﬁeld (GRF) method10 can be viewed as Ewald potentials for a non-
homogeneous background charge. The SSRF and GRF potentials are the solutions to the
Poisson equation for a source charge and a compensating background. The background
charge densities in the SSRF and GRF method are that of a homogeneous sphere and a
radially symmetric charge distribution centered around the source charge, respectively. The
SSRF and GRF method have a ﬁnite range because of the radially symmetric background
charge densities that exactly compensate the source charge when the cut-oﬀ distance is
reached.

Comparison of Ewald potentials from simulation of water to electrostatic
potentials in isolated water droplets. It is interesting to make some simple numerical
comparisons between the Ewald potentials that are experienced in simulation of water with
periodic boundary conditions to the corresponding electrostatic potentials in water droplets.
Such a comparison is simpliﬁed if we locate a distinguished solute at the origin of our
Cartesian coordinate system. For a spherical Lennard-Jones solute, Figure 4 shows a typical
variation of the electrostatic potential at the solute center with inclusion of the charge
density in progressively larger spherical volumes of radius R around the solute. Notice the
substantial variation of the electrostatic potential with inclusion of the solvation shells near
the solute. However, after about three shells the net electrostatic potential oscillates about
the Ewald asymptotic value before the ball penetrates the physical interface of the droplet.
Thereafter, the net electrostatic potential displays the eﬀects of the surface polarization of
the droplet as it makes a transition to the very diﬀerent value that characterizes the whole
It is clear in this case that the Ewald potential faithfully captures this interior

potential while avoiding detailed considerations of the droplet interface.

Single ion hydration free energies are well-deﬁned within molecular simu-
lations. Electrostatic potentials can be deﬁned unambiguously as solutions of the Pois-
son equation with speciﬁed charge densities and boundary conditions. Electrostatic poten-
tials are computed throughout simulations of aqueous solutions even if charge densities and
boundary conditions may not be speciﬁed explicitly. If the system of interest is non-neutral,
these issues deserve emphasis because single ion free energies are typically not measured
experimentally.

On a molecular scale, dependences on speciﬁcs of the boundary conditions in the deﬁni-
tion of single ion hydration free energies can be avoided. This is accomplished by spherically
integrating the electrostatic potential over the charge density around a charge site up to
a distance where that potential saturates. Using Ewald interactions corresponds to such a
spherical integration.41,54 Figure 4 shows results for electrostatic potentials obtained using
two diﬀerent choices for the boundary conditions – a solute-water cluster and a periodic
system. The observed agreement is a non-trivial computer experimental observation.

4. System Size Extrapolation

Computer simulations are performed for a ﬁnite system of molecules. In most applica-
tions, the properties of the thermodynamic-limit, inﬁnite system are sought. In Coulombic
systems, pronounced ﬁnite-size eﬀects are ubiquitous due to the long range of the interac-

8

tions. We can separate ﬁnite-size eﬀects in Coulombic systems into two categories: (1) those
caused purely by the long-range electrostatics independent of the thermodynamic state; and
(2) ﬁnite size eﬀects that depend on the thermodynamic state (temperature, pressure, etc.).
The electrostatic ﬁnite-size eﬀects in the Ewald treatment of Coulomb interactions arise
from self-interactions and interactions with the neutralizing background essential for non-
neutral systems under periodic boundary conditions. Electrostatic ﬁnite-size eﬀects can be
treated exactly by including the second and third sum in the electrostatic energy Uel of the
solute eq 6, which account for self-interactions of the solute.13,14,53,59 For an ion of charge q,
the resulting correction to the solvation chemical potential is14,53

µelec = µsim +

(8)

where µsim is the chemical potential for charging the ion from zero charge to net charge
q calculated from the Ewald interactions with the solvent excluding self-interactions (i.e.,
including only the ﬁrst sum in eq 6); µelec includes the self-interactions; and ξ is the ionic
self-term. For a cubic box of length L, we have ξ = limr→0[ϕ(r) − 1/|r| ≈ −2.837297/L.
Electrostatic ﬁnite size corrections for polar molecules are developed in Ref. 13.

Thermodynamic ﬁnite-size eﬀects on the other hand can only be corrected approximately
within a model. For instance, we can use the diﬀerence between a truly inﬁnite version of
a model and its ﬁnite periodic version to correct for thermodynamic ﬁnite size eﬀects,60–62
as schematically shown in Figure 5. For spherical ions, a Born model63 and its periodic
equivalent leads to ﬁnite size corrections that depend on the dielectric constant ǫ of the
solvent, an eﬀective Born radius RB of the ion, and the net charge q of the ion:60,64

where µtherm is the chemical potential for charging that includes the thermodynamic and

Figure 6 illustrates the ﬁnite size eﬀects for the free energies of charging Im(p) and Im(+)
after correction for Ewald self-interactions. Free energies were calculated from sixth-order
integration formulas with corrected means and variances from Table II that include the
electrostatic14 but not the thermodynamic ﬁnite-size correction. The free energy is plotted
as a function of 1/L3 where L is the box length. We ﬁnd that the free energy of charging
the polar Im(p) is independent of the system size within the statistical errors of about 1
kJ/mol for N = 16 to N = 512 water molecules. However, the free energy of charging the
Im(+) cation shows a system size dependence proportional to 1/L3, as would be expected
from our ﬁnite size analysis.60 Rather than using a more realistic shape of the molecule in
the dielectric model of ref 60, we ﬁt the observed free energies to to the spherical Born
model eq 8 with an eﬀective radius RB = 0.207 nm and an inﬁnite dielectric constant which
reproduces the data over the whole range of system sizes of 16 ≤ N ≤ 512 water molecules.
To further illustrate the power of the ﬁnite-size corrections, Figure 7 shows the proba-
bility distributions of electrostatic interaction energies Uel of the imidazolium cation Im(+)
with the N water molecules eq 6. Also shown in Figure 7 are the corresponding gaussian
distributions, which nicely reproduce the calculated histograms of Uel. However, we observe
a strong system size dependence: small systems have narrower distributions of Uel with

9

less negative averages compared to large systems. When we apply the electrostatic and
thermodynamic ﬁnite size corrections for the mean and average, the gaussian distributions
“collapse” to a single distribution corresponding to the limit of an inﬁnite system size. We
for N = 16 water molecules, the average Uel
note that the ﬁnite-size correction is large:
changes by about −370 kJ/mol (250 kBT ).

5. Perturbation Theory

A fundamental view of the thermodynamics due to electrostatic interactions may be ob-
tained from consideration of the distribution p(u; λ = 0) of electrostatic energies u in the
reference charge state λ = 0. The part of the chemical potential due to electrostatic inter-
actions ∆µ(λ), the thermodynamic parameter sought is then expressed by the fundamental
result

Z
Here, β−1 = kBT is the temperature and h. . .iλ=0 denotes a thermal average with the solute
in reference state λ = 0. This formula requires the consideration of the electrostatic potential
even though the electrostatic potential of a phase is an operationally subtle property.58,65
Despite that subtlety, the potential sought is conceptually well-deﬁned as the solution of
Poisson’s equation with speciﬁed charge density and boundary conditions.14,53,58,59,66

Direct use of eq 9 can present diﬃculties. Though p(u) is often substantially gaussian,
the fundamental formula eq 9 is sensitive to the tails of p(u). That limits the applicability
of eq 9 for calculations of even small changes in the charge state λ. In addition, the simple
estimator lnhe−βλuiλ=0 ≈ ln[M −1
i=1 e−βλui] from M energies ui observed in a simulation
is biased and large sample sizes M are required for this bias to be negligible.67

where ǫ is the dielectric constant of the solvent. The matching of the second-order terms
between the cumulant expansion and the continuum formula provides a determination of the
radius R of a spherical ion. The distributions, p(u; λ = 0), required to evaluate the cumulant
averages involve the non-electrostatic interactions, λ=0, between solvent molecules and the
solute. The indicated average thus generally depends upon full characterization of the
solvent. Note that the continuum model neglects the molecular contribution linear in λ.
This linear term contributes to the asymmetry between anion and cation solvation, making
the solvation of anions more favorable for a given ion size.14

(13)

In principle, higher-order cumulants could be used to obtain information about the other
Taylor coeﬃcients. However, as was observed by Smith and van Gunsteren,69 higher-order
cumulants are increasingly diﬃcult to extract from computer simulations of limited duration.
Though direct extension of perturbation theory beyond fourth order has been impractical,
interpolative approximations polynomial in λ have been more successful. For the charging
of water and ions, polynomials of order six and higher were necessary to account for the
simulation data.13,14,71 Thus, perturbation theory was found to be unsatisfactory in such
cases. For atomic14 and molecular ions,24 a kink is typically observed for d∆µ(λ)/dλ as a
function of charge λ at modest values of this parameter when the solvation shell changes
from a cationic to an anionic structure. Additional nonlinearities were observed at high
values of the ionic charge λ.17,75

Table II contains the averages and variances of the electrostatic energies of Im(p) and
Im(+) for system sizes between 16 and 512 water molecules. Errors of one standard deviation
of the mean were estimated by plotting the block error as a function of the number of blocks.
The estimated error reaches a plateau when block values are uncorrelated. From the averages
and variances, we can calculate the chemical potentials of charging using integration formulas
(ijk) exact to various orders that involve i, j, and k derivatives of the free energy with respect
to the coupling parameter at the uncharged, half-charged, and fully charged state:71

Formulas involving higher cumulants and diﬀerent nodes λi are discussed in Ref. 71. The
integration formulas eqs 14a to 14e are exact to order 2, 2, 4, 4, and 6 in a perturbation
expansion, respectively.70,71 Figure 8 shows the free energy diﬀerence between Im(+) and
Im(p) as a function of the integration order for the 512 water molecule system. We ﬁnd that
as the order of the integration formula increases, the free energy diﬀerence converges, with

11

the sixth order formula bracketed by the two fourth-order formulas. The statistical error of
the free energy diﬀerence is about 1.5 kJ/mol. Notice that the discrepancy between the two
second-order results of Figure 8 is signiﬁcant on the scale of the statistical uncertainties.
This emphasizes that the charging free energy is not a quadratic function of the coupling
parameter. Note that the centered second-order formula76 has a smaller systematic error.

Figure 9 illustrates the complete four-node thermodynamic cycle, where λ is a coupling
parameter changing the partial charges on the molecule linearly from state zero to one.
The four nodes of the cycle are the uncharged and charged imidazole and imidazolium. We
ﬁnd that the free energies of charging and conformational changes are consistent within the
statistical errors. Interestingly, the free energy of charging the polar Im(p) to the Im(+)
cation has a maximum for the linear charging path chosen here. This increase reﬂects the
linear terms of eq 12, i.e., increasing the net charge on the imidazole initially costs free
energy.

Dielectric continuum models predict a quadratic proportionality of the free energy of
charging on the linear coupling parameter λ. In a molecular theory, such a quadratic charg-
ing free energy arises when the probability density of electrostatic potential ﬂuctuations
is gaussian. Second-order perturbation theory would then be exact. Figure 10 compares
second-order perturbation theory with the reference sixth-order free energy polynomial cal-
culated from the averages and variances in Table II. We ﬁnd that the perturbation expan-
sions about the charged state (λ = 1) are accurate over a relatively wide range from λ = 1 to
almost λ = 0.2. The expansion about the uncharged state λ = 0 on the other hand breaks
down rapidly at about λ = 0.2.

6. Non-Gaussian Fluctuations

Multistate Gaussian Models. One idea for improvement of dielectric models is based
upon a physical discription of the structure of the ﬁrst hydration shell. It can be viewed from
the perspective of Stillinger-Weber inherent structures or substates.77 These are potential
energy basins of attraction for steepest-descent quenching of ﬁrst hydration shell molecules.
If those ﬁrst hydration shell molecules stayed always in one basin, then a gaussian model
for thermal ﬂuctuations would be reasonable. Empirical radii parameters reﬂect the char-
acteristics of that single basin. However, changing conditions may result in reweighting of
slightly accessible basins or the opening of new basins. The gaussian or dielectric models
may fail to describe these possibilities well. This picture is physically better deﬁned than
the commonly nonspeciﬁc discussions of electrostriction and dielectric saturation.

A corresponding “multistate gaussian model” was developed in ref 21. Attention is di-
rected to the thermal probability distribution of electrostatic potential energies of the solute.
Rather than approximating this distribution as a single gaussian distribution, perhaps with
perturbative corrections, we discriminate hydration structure on the basis of simple pa-
rameters diagnostic of hydration substates. We assume that the probability distribution of
electrostatic potential energies is gaussian for each substate. Therefore the full distribution
is a superposition of gaussian distributions for the various substates.

Thus we attempt to represent the observed complicating features of p(u) by a combination

of simpler states:

p(u) =

wnpn(u) ,

(15)

n
X

12

n wn = 1 and normalized densities pn(u) ≥ 0,

du pn(u) = 1. We
with weights wn ≥ 0,
will seek pn(u)’s of gaussian form, representing the overall system as a linear combination of
gaussian subsystems, each showing linear response to electrostatic interactions. Representing
p(u) by a sum of gaussian densities can give nontrivial results for the chemical potential, as
can be seen by substituting eq 15 into eq 9,

where mn and σn

2 are the mean and variance of the gaussian pn, respectively.
The non-gaussian ﬂuctuations of the electrostatic potential in liquid water are associated
with changes in the conformations of protons that make hydrogen bonds to the solute. If
those ﬂuctuations could be tempered, a gaussian model might become more accurate. Thus,
suitable substate diagnostic parameters are the number of hydrogen bonds made to the
solute.

Explicit calculations have shown that this approach eliminates most of the detailed nu-
merical inaccuracies of the gaussian ﬂuctuation models for hydration of a water molecule
in liquid water.21 The markedly non-gaussian p(u) was accurately represented as the sum
of gaussian distributions implied by this deﬁnition of a hydration substate. We found
wn > 10−3 for 1 ≤ n ≤ 6 with 3.64 being the average number of neighbors and n = 4
the most probable number of neighbors. The calculated change of the chemical potential
upon change of the charge state of a solute water molecule is correct to within 5 %. This is
a remarkable result because ∆µ(λ) is non-quadratic, requiring an eighth-order polynomial
to ﬁt the simulation data for chemical-potential derivatives.13,14,71 This shows that suﬃcient
information can be extracted from the simulation to describe the distribution p(u) helpfully;
and that such an approach can be successful even for perturbations involving changes of the
chemical potential as large as 14 kBT .

Similar behavior can be anticipated for hydration of other neutral, polar solutes such as
the imidazole example studied here. Figure 10 (inset) shows the results of the multistate
gaussian model applied to charging and uncharging the polar imidazole Im(p). Fluctuation
data were collected from a simulation of the uncharged and charged Im(p) in N = 128 water
molecules, extending over 106 MC passes to allow for error estimates. Instead of determining
the overall mean and variance of the electrostatic potential for a second-order perturbation
expansion, we calculate the means and variances for several gaussian distributions from
structures sorted according to the number of hydrogen bonds.
Inspection of the radial
distribution functions of water oxygen and hydrogen around imidazole sites shows one strong
hydrogen bond donor, H1, and one acceptor, N3. As a criterion for the formation of a water-
imidazole hydrogen bond, we used that the distance between the acceptor (nitrogen N3 or
water oxygen) and the donor hydrogen has to be smaller than 0.23 nm. We can then sort
structures according to the numbers of hydrogen bonds accepted and donated by the solute.
With this simple criterion, we ﬁnd that six and two gaussian dustributions contribute to the
expansions about the charged and uncharged state of Im(p), respectively. This multistate
gaussian model greatly improves the quality of the expansions, both about the charged and
uncharged state. The reference free energy is now within the statistical errors of the two
multistate gaussian models over the whole range 0 ≤ λ ≤ 1.

Quasi-chemical theories. Those more diﬃcult anionic cases mentioned above can be
attacked more directly. The local neighborhood is again used to discriminate structural

13

possibilities. But, in addition, the consequences for the hydration free energy of the molecu-
lar interactions within that neighborhood are treated fully. This reserves the longer-ranged
interactions for simple approximations, e.g. with gaussian models.

These theoretical developments arose from recent molecular calculations23 that suggested
how a chemical perspective can be helpful in computing thermodynamic properties of water
3+
and aqueous solutions. That calculation used electronic structure results on the Fe(H2O)6
cluster and simple, physical estimates of further solvation eﬀects. The results were organized
according to the pattern of a simple chemical reaction and a surprisingly accurate evaluation
of the hydration free energy was obtained. Despite this recent motivation, the theories devel-
oped are akin to good approximations of historical and pedagogical importance in the areas
of cooperative phenomena and phase transitions.78 In those areas, similar approximations
are called Guggenheim, quasi-chemical, or Bethe approximations.

These quasi-chemical theories22 are constructed by considering a geometric volume ﬁxed
on the solute molecule and performing a calculation analogous to the evaluation of a grand
canonical partition function for that volume. All the possibilities for occupancy of that
volume by solvent or other solution species must be considered eventually. The ﬁnal result
can be described by reference to simple patterns of chemical equilibria such as:

X q− + nH2O ⇀↽ X(H2O)n

q− .

(17)

The solute of interest is denoted here generically as X q−; a star-type cluster of that solute
with n water (W) molecules is considered as the product. For such a cluster, call it an
M-cluster, we could calculate the equilibrium ratio KM for a dilute gas phase. Note that
n is dimensionless and this observation resolves standard state issues. The factors
KM ρW
denoted by hexp{−β∆u}i0,C, where C indicates either a water molecule or the M-cluster,
carry information about solvation free energy of the species involved. For the species other
than the cluster this is the familiar Widom factor. For the cluster, this factor requires
slight additional restriction but can be verbally deﬁned by saying that it is the average
of the Boltzmann factor for cluster-solution interactions over the thermal motion of the
cluster and solution under the condition that the only interactions between these subsystems
rigidly exclude additional solvent molecules from the cluster volume for the complex. This
restriction enforces a constraint required to preserve simple enumerations that underlie these
results. The theoretical structure is designed so that simple approximations such as dielectric
models might be used for the factors hexp{−β∆u}i0,C. But more detailed techniques might
be applied to the calculation of KM . Finally, we compile

˜KM ≡ KM

hexp{−β∆u}i0,M
[hexp{−β∆u}i0,W ]n .

(18)

Thus, this ˜KM is built on the pattern of the chemical equilibrium eq 17 but without a
‘solvation factor’ for the ‘bare’ solute.

Now consider all possibilities for clusters. A thermodynamic implication of this informa-

tion is:

µXq− = kT ln[ρXq−V /qXq−] − kT ln[p0

˜KM ρW

n].

(19)

XM

14

p0 is the probability that the clustering volume would be observed to be empty in the
equilibrium solution; thus −kT ln p0 is the free energy for formation of a cavity for the
clustering volume in the solution. The sum is over all clusters with zero or more ligands.
The product of the densities involved with each term includes a density factor for each ligand.
This formula makes the conventional separation between the contributions of intermolecular
interactions and the non-interaction (ideal) terms; qXq− is the partition function of the
bare solute in the absence of interactions with any other species and ρXq− is the density of
the solute. As an example, for an atomic ion such as the chloride ion Cl− we would put
qXq− = V /Λ3 with V the volume of the system and Λ the thermal deBroglie wavelength of
the chloride ion. This formula becomes approximate when approximate models are adopted
for p0, for KM , and for the solvation factors. Those quantities depend on deﬁnition of the
clustering volume. But, since the physical problem is independent of those parameters, the
theory should be insensitive to them.

The motivation of this approach is the fact that a substantial but intricate part of the
free energy sought is to be found in KM . The number of possibilities for ligand populations
will be small for molecular scale clustering volumes. So a limited number of terms must be
considered. Because the clusters will be small systems, elaborate computational methods
can be applied to the prediction of the KM , including current electronic structure techniques.
With the complicated chemical interactions separated for individual treatment the remaining
hydration contributions should be simpler and the required theories better controlled.

Equation 19 should be compared with eq 16. One diﬀerence is that eq 19 attempts to
provide the whole hydration free energy, not just that part due to electrostatic interactions.
That explains the presence of p0 in eq 19. Beyond that, the structures of these formulas
are similar. The presence of more than one term in the sum of eq 19 is an expression of
an entropy contribution associated with the possibilities for diﬀerent ligand populations.
Finally, the complete calculation of the KM includes non-gaussian statistical possibilities
not anticipated by eq 16.

7. Conclusions

Recent calculations of the hydration free energy due to electrostatic interactions between
charged and polar solutes in water have obtained high accuracy results for the simple molec-
ular models that are the basis of most simulation calculations.13,14,21,62,79,80 An important
step in securing those high accuracy results has been a careful consideration of treatment
of long-ranged interactions. That work suggests that that the Ewald method is an easy way
to get correct hydration free energies from molecular calculations, that is, to achieve well
characterized results appropriate to the thermodynamic limit in which the system size tends
to inﬁnity for given densities and temperature. Additionally, it suggests that molecular
simulations with Ewald potentials and periodic boundary conditions can have eﬃciencies
comparable to rougher approximations that are often employed to compute hydration free
energies for molecularly well-deﬁned problems.81 And furthermore, this has produced a sim-
ple, eﬀective, and clear understanding of how to extrapolate electrostatic hydration free
energies to the thermodynamic limit; an accurate evaluation of the hydration free energy of
imidazole can be obtained with as few as 16 water molecules included in the simulation.

These high accuracy results for well-deﬁned models permitted careful testing of simple
theories of electrostatic hydration free energies. The simplest theories, dielectric continuum

15

models, have been found to be rough despite the fact that they can always be adjusted to
reproduce an empirical answer given a priori. Such a conclusion has surely been widely
expected. However, the testing has led to new theories, the multistate gaussian and quasi-
chemical theories, that should permit more revealing molecular scale calculations. The
quasi-chemical approaches seem to provide the most natural way to utilize current electronic
structure packages to study electronic structure issues for solution species. This should be
particularly helpful for treatment of basic, molecular anions that are ubiquitous in aqueous
solution chemistry.

Physical conclusions more speciﬁcally are that the most prominent failings of the sim-
plest theories are associated with solvent proton conformations that lead to non-gaussian
ﬂuctuations of electrostatic potentials. Thus, the most favorable cases for the second-order
perturbation theories are monoatomic positive ions. In such cases, oxygen-hydrogen bonds
are oriented away from the ion, placing those protons as far out as possible. Neutral, polar
molecules with speciﬁc hydrogen-bond accepting interactions with the solvent are more dif-
ﬁcult for these theories, though the hydration free energies sought are smaller in magnitude.
Negative molecular ions are expected to oﬀer further complications because now the prob-
lematic proton motions occur close to the solute and the hydration eﬀects will be larger for
anionic species.

Comparison of dielectric models (ordinate) with molecular simulations (ab-
scissa) for the induced electrostatic potentials due to the solvent at the atom centers for
Im(+). Dielectric model results were obtained for several sets of radii in current use: di-
amonds: RC=0.267 nm, RN =0.231 nm;44 large circles: RH(N )=0.1160 nm, RH(C)=0.1710
nm, RC=0.230 nm, RN =0.150 nm;36 small circles: RH=0.1172 nm, RC=0.2096 nm,
RN =0.1738 nm;45 crosses: RH=0.1172 nm, RC=0.1635 nm, RN =0.1738 nm.45 A bound-
ary element method was used for the dielectric model calculations.46 Notice that a radii set
that happens to be qualitatively satisfactory for the cation (diamonds) can be signiﬁcantly
less satisfactory for the slightly diﬀerent circumstance of the neutral polar molecule.

Figure 5. Schematic representation of the thermodynamic ﬁnite-size correction. The ther-
2222222
!!!!!!!
modynamic ﬁnite-size correction {. . .} is the diﬀerence between an inﬁnite Born model and a
Born model under periodic boundary conditions. A spherical ion of charge q and radius RB
is embedded in a medium with a dielectric constant ǫ inside the simulation box. In addition,
the box is ﬁlled with the neutralizing background charge. Periodic boundary conditions are
applied. The corresponding electrostatic potential is determined from the Poisson equation
with appropriate boundary conditions on the box boundary and ion surface.58

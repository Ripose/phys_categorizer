Abstract

In order to resolve a signiﬁcant uncertainty in the heat of vaporization

of silicon — a fundamental parameter in gas-phase thermochemistry —

∆H ◦

f,0[Si(g)] has been determined from a thermochemical cycle involving the

precisely known experimental heats of formation of SiF4(g) and F(g) and a

benchmark calculation of the total atomization energy (TAE0) of SiF4 us-

ing coupled-cluster methods. Basis sets up to [8s7p6d4f 2g1h] on Si and

[7s6p5d4f 3g2h] on F have been employed, and extrapolations for residual

basis set incompleteness applied. The contributions of inner-shell correlation

(−0.08 kcal/mol), scalar relativistic eﬀects (−1.88 kcal/mol), atomic spin-

orbit splitting (−1.97 kcal/mol), and anharmonicity in the zero-point energy

(+0.04 kcal/mol) have all been explicitly accounted for. Our benchmark

TAE0=565.89±0.22 kcal/mol

leads to ∆H ◦

f,0[Si(g)]=107.15±0.38 kcal/mol

(∆H ◦

f,298[Si(g)]=108.19±0.38 kcal/mol):

between the JANAF/CODATA

value of 106.5±1.9 kcal/mol and the revised value proposed by Grev and

1

Schaefer [J. Chem. Phys. 1992, 97, 8389], 108.1±0.5 kcal/mol. The revision

will be relevant for future computational studies on heats of formation of sil-

icon compounds. Among standard computational thermochemistry methods,

G2 and G3 theory exhibit large errors, while CBS-Q performs relatively well

and the very recent W1 theory reproduces the present calibration result to

0.1 kcal/mol.

I. INTRODUCTION

For three of the ﬁrst-and second-row elements, namely Be, B, and Si, the tabulated heats

of formation of the atoms in the gas phase carry experimental uncertainties in excess of 1

kcal/mol. Aside from being propagated into uncertainties for experimental gas-phase ther-

mochemical data for compounds involving these elements, they adversely aﬀect the accuracy

of any directly computed heat of formation — be it ab initio or semiempirical — of any Be,

B, or Si-containing compounds through the identity

∆H ◦

f,T (XkYlZm. . . ) − k∆H ◦

f,T (X) − l∆H ◦

f,T (Y) − m∆H ◦

f,T (Z) − . . .

= ET (XkYlZm. . . ) + RT (1 − k − l − m − . . .) − kET (X) − lET (Y) − mET (Z) − . . .

(1)

Particularly given the importance of boron and silicon compounds, this is a rather unsatis-

factory state of aﬀairs.

Recently we succeeded [1] in reducing the uncertainty for boron by almost an order of

magnitude (from 3 kcal/mol to 0.4 kcal/mol) by means of a benchmark calculation of the

total atomization energy (TAE0) of BF3(g). By combining the latter with the experimen-

tally precisely known [2] heat of formation of BF3, we were able to indirectly obtain the

vaporization enthalphy of boron to high accuracy. It was thus shown that a 1977 experiment

by Storms and Mueller [3], which was considered an outlier by the leading compilation of

thermochemical tables [4], was in fact the correct value.

The heat of formation of Si(g) is given in the JANAF [4] as well as the CODATA [2]

2

tables as 106.5±1.9 kcal/mol. Desai [5] reviewed the available data and recommended the

JANAF/CODATA value, but with a reduced uncertainty of ±1.0 kcal/mol. Recently, Grev

and Schaefer (GS) [6] found that their ab initio calculated TAE[SiH4], despite basis set

incompleteness, was actually larger than the value derived from the experimental heats of

formation of Si(g), H(g), and SiH4(g). They suggested that the heat of vaporization of
f,0[Si(g)]=108.07±0.50 kcal/mol, a suggestion supported

silicon be revised upwards to ∆H ◦

by Ochterski et al. [7].

The calculations by GS neglected relativistic contributions, which were very recently

considered by Collins and Grev (CG) [8]. Using relativistic (Douglas-Kroll [9]) coupled-

cluster methods, these authors found that the TAE of SiH4 contains a relativistic con-

tribution of −0.67 kcal/mol. Combined with the earlier calculations of GS, this yields

∆H ◦

f,0[Si(g)]=107.4±0.5 kcal/mol, within Desai’s reduced error bar. However, as discussed

there [8], the experimental data for silane, SiH4, involve an ambiguity. The JANAF heat

of formation of silane, 10.5±0.5 kcal/mol is in fact the Gunn and Green [10] measurement

of 9.5 kcal/mol increased with a correction [11] of +1 kcal/mol for the phase transition

Si(amorphous)→Si(cr), which was considered an artifact of the method of preparation by

Gunn and Green. If one were to accept their argument, the GS and CG calculations on SiH4

would actually support the original JANAF/CODATA ∆H ◦

f,0[Si(g)].

No such ambiguities exist for tetraﬂuorosilane, SiF4, for which a very accurate experimen-

tal heat of formation has been determined [12] by direct combination of the pure elements

in their respective standard states in a ﬂuorine bomb calorimeter. Johnson’s [12] heat of for-

mation at 298.15 K, −386.18±0.11 kcal/mol, is slightly higher in absolute value and slightly

more precise than the CODATA value of −386.0±0.2 kcal/mol, itself based on an earlier

experiment from the same laboratory [13].

Clearly, if a benchmark quality (preferably ±0.3 kcal/mol or better) TAE[SiF4(g)] could

be calculated, then an unambiguous redetermination of ∆H ◦

f,0[Si(g)] would be possible. Our

previous study on BF3 being at the limit of the then available computational hardware,

3

a similar study on SiF4 — which contains an additional heavy atom and eight additional

valence electrons, leading to an expected increase in CPU time and memory requirements by

a factor of about 3.7 (see below) — could only be completed most recently, and is reported

in the present contribution.

II. METHODS

Most electronic structure calculations reported here were carried out using MOLPRO

97.3 [14] running on SGI Octane and SGI Origin 2000 minisupercomputers at the Weizmann

Institute of Science. The very largest calculation, a full-valence coupled-cluster calculation

involving 620 basis functions, was carried out on the National Partnership for Advanced

Computational Infrastructure CRAY T90 at the San Diego Supercomputer Center.

As in our previous study on BF3, all electron correlation calculations involved in deter-

mining the valence and inner-shell correlation contributions to TAE were carried out using

the CCSD [15] and CCSD(T) [16,17] coupled-cluster methods. (For the energies of the con-

stituent atoms, the deﬁnition of Ref. [17] for the open-shell CCSD(T) energy was employed.)

Both the very low T1 diagnostic [18] of 0.012, and inspection of the largest coupled-cluster

amplitudes, suggest a system essentially totally dominated by dynamical correlation. From

experience it is known [19] that CCSD(T) yields results very close to the exact (full conﬁg-

uration interaction) basis set correlation energy under such circumstances.

Basis set limits for the SCF and valence correlation limits were extrapolated (see below for

details) from calculated results using the (A)VTZ+2d1f, (A)VQZ+2d1f, and (A)V5Z+2d1f

basis sets. For silicon, those basis sets consist of the standard Dunning correlation consistent

[20,21] cc-pVTZ, cc-pVQZ, and cc-pV5Z basis sets augmented with two high-exponent d

and one high-exponent f functions with exponents obtained by progressively multiplying

the highest exponent already present by a factor of 2.5. The addition of such ‘inner shell

polarization functions’ [22] has been shown [22–25] to be essential for smooth basis set

convergence in second-row compounds, particularly those containing highly polar bonds

4

such as SiF4 [26]. (It should be recalled that inner shell polarization is a pure SCF eﬀect

and bears little relationship to inner shell correlation.

In the present case of SiF4, the

contribution of the inner polarization functions to the SCF/(A)VTZ+2d1f TAE was found

to be no less than 9.81 kcal/mol.) For ﬂuorine, the basis sets given correspond to Dunning

(diﬀuse function)-augmented correlation consistent [27] aug-cc-pVTZ, aug-cc-pVQZ, and

aug-cc-pV5Z basis sets — it was shown repeatedly (e.g. [28]) that the use of augmented

basis sets on highly electronegative elements such as F in polar compounds is absolutely

indispensable for accurate binding energies. The ﬁnal basis sets for SiF4 involve 235, 396,

and 620 basis functions, respectively, for (A)VTZ+2d1f, (A)VQZ+2d1f, and (A)V5Z+2d1f.

The geometry of SiF4 was optimized by repeated parabolic interpolation at the

CCSD(T)/cc-pVQZ+1 level, where the suﬃx ‘+1’ stands for the addition of a tight d func-

tion with an exponent [24] of 2.082 on Si. In previous work on H2SiO [25], one of us found

that this recovers essentially all of the inner polarization eﬀect on the molecular geometry.

The bond length thus obtained, re[SiF4]=1.56043 ˚A, was used throughout this work. (For

comparison, the experimental r0=1.5598(2) ˚A [29]; to our knowledge, no experimentally

derive re is available.)

The inner-shell correlation contribution was determined by comparing the computed

binding energies correlating all electrons except Si(1s), and correlating only valence electrons,

using the MTsmall basis set [30]. The latter is a variant of the Martin-Taylor core correlation

basis set [31,32] in which the very tightest p, d, and f functions were deleted at no signiﬁcant

loss in accuracy on the contributions to TAE.

The scalar relativistic contributions were obtained as expectation values of the ﬁrst-order

Darwin and mass-velocity operators [33,34] at the ACPF (averaged coupled-pair functional

[35]) level using the MTsmall basis set. All electrons were correlated in this calculation,

and it should be noted that the MTsmall basis set is completely uncontracted and therefore

ﬂexible enough in the s and p functions for this purpose. For the sake of illustration, this

approach yields −0.67 kcal/mol for SiH4, identical to two decimal places with the more

5

rigorous relativistic coupled-cluster value [8].

The contribution of atomic spin-orbit splitting derived from the experimental atomic ﬁne

structures [36] of Si(3P ) and F(2S) is −1.968 kcal/mol. For comparison, we also carried

out all-electron CASSCF/CI spin-orbit calculations [37] using the spdf part of a completely

uncontracted aug-cc-pV5Z basis set, augmented with a single tight p, three tight d, and

two tight f functions in even-tempered series with ratio 3.0. In this manner, we obtain a

contribution of −1.940 kcal/mol. In short, to the accuracy relevant for this purpose it is

immaterial whether the computed or the experimentally derived value is used.

The zero-point energy was obtained from the experimentally derived harmonic frequen-

cies and anharmonicity constants of McDowell et al. [29]. This leads to a value of 8.029

kcal/mol, whereas one would obtain 8.067 kcal/mol from one-half the sum of the harmonic

frequencies, Pi diωi/2 and 7.975 from one-half the sum of the fundamentals, Pi diνi/2. The

approximation Pi di(ωi + νi)/4, at 8.021 kcal/mol, yields essentially the exact result.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

All relevant data are given in Table 1.

As expected, the SCF contribution of TAE converges quite rapidly. We have shown

previously [38] that the SCF convergence behavior is best described by a geometric extrap-

olation A + B/C n of the type ﬁrst proposed by Feller [39], with extrapolation from the TAE

contributions to be preferred over extrapolation from the constituent total energies. From

the (A)VTZ+2d1f, (A)VQZ+2d1f, and (A)V5Z+2d1f results, i.e. Feller(TQ5), we obtain a

basis set limit of 448.43 kcal/mol, 0.02 kcal/mol more than the SCF/(A)V5Z+2d1f result

itself. An extrapolation from the (A)VDZ+2d, (A)VTZ+2d1f, and (A)VQZ+2d1f basis sets

would have yielded 448.47 kcal/mol, an increment of 0.22 kcal/mol over the (A)VQZ+2d1f

result.

Given the large number of valence electrons, connected triple excitations account for

a rather small part of the binding energy: 9.61 kcal/mol at the CCSD(T)/(A)VQZ+2d1f

6

level, compared to a CCSD valence correlation contribution of 114.85 kcal/mol and an SCF

contribution of 448.25 kcal/mol. Since a CCSD(T)/(A)V5Z+2d1f calculation is beyond the

limits particularly of memory and available CPU time for this system, this suggests an

approach in which only the CCSD valence correlation contribution be obtained from the

largest basis set, while the (T) contribution is obtained from an extrapolation on smaller

basis sets.

Indeed, Martin and de Oliveira (MdO) recently found in a systematic study

[30] on a wide variety of ﬁrst-and second-row molecules that this essentially does not aﬀect

the quality of the results, except when the (T) contribution is a dominant component to

the binding energy. Helgaker and coworkers [40] previously noted the more rapid basis set

convergence behavior of connected triple excitations as compared with the CCSD correlation

energy.

The CCSD/(A)V5Z+2d1f calculation required over 3GB of memory, some 120 GB of disk

space, and 43 hours of real time (81 hours of CPU time) running on 8 CPUs of the NPACI

CRAY T90. (Close to 99% parallellism was achieved in the CCSD code simply by adapting

it to use vendor-supplied parallel BLAS and LAPACK libraries.) To our knowledge, this is

the largest coupled-cluster calculation ever carried out using a conventional algorithm.

We have considered two extrapolation formulas based on the asymptotic behavior of

pair correlation energies [41,42], namely the 3-point extrapolation A + B/(l + 1/2)α due to

Martin, and the 2-point extrapolation A + B/l3 formula due to Helgaker and coworkers [43].

(In both formulas, l stands for the maximum angular momentum present in the basis set.)

MdO found [30] that both formulas tend to predict the same basis set limit if extrapolated

from suﬃciently large basis sets, but that the limits predicted by the A + B/l3 formula

are much more stable with respect to reduction of the sizes of the basis sets used in the

extrapolation. This is at least in part related to the fact that the three-point extrapolation

involves, of necessity, one value with an even smaller l than the two-point extrapolation.

As an illustration, let us consider the BF diatomic which was used to reﬁne the BF3 result

[1]. From the three-point A + B/(l + 1/2)α extrapolation applied to AVnZ (n=3,4,5) valence

7

correlation contributions to De, we obtain 38.35 kcal/mol, compared to 38.76 kcal/mol for

AVnZ (n=4,5,6). In contrast, a A + B/l3 extrapolation applied to AVnZ (n=Q,5) yields

38.78 kcal/mol, just like AVnZ (n=5,6) does; application to AVnZ (n=T,Q) results yields

an overestimate of 39.08 kcal/mol.

In the present case, the A+B/l3 formula predicts a CCSD limit contribution to TAE[SiF4]

of 119.28 kcal/mol from the (A)VQZ+2d1f and (A)V5Z+2d1f results, with the extrapola-

tion accounting for 2.27 kcal/mol of the ﬁnal result. For comparison, extrapolation from

two smaller basis sets, (A)VTZ+2d1f and (A)VQZ+2d1f, yields 119.62 kcal/mol, while the

A + B/(l + 1/2)α formula applied to all three values yields a much smaller value of 118.87

kcal/mol.

The (T) contribution is computed as 9.11 and 9.61 kcal/mol, respectively,

in the

(A)VTZ+2d1f and (A)VQZ+2d1f basis sets: assuming A + B/l3 behavior, this extrapo-

lates to a limit of 9.98 kcal/mol. We thus ﬁnally ﬁnd a basis set limit valence correlation

contribution of 129.26 kcal/mol.

As expected, the Si(2s,2p) and F(1s) inner-shell correlation energy is quite substantial

in absolute terms, accounting for some 28% of the overall correlation energy excluding the

very deep Si(1s) core. As we have seen in the past for second-row molecules, however, the

diﬀerential contribution to TAE nearly cancels, in this case being only +0.08 kcal/mol. This

contribution is deﬁnitely dwarfed by that of scalar relativistic eﬀects, which as we noted we

compute to be −1.88 kcal/mol.

Combining all of the above with the atomic spin-orbit correction noted in the Methods

section, we ﬁnally obtain a “bottom-of-the-well” TAEe of 573.92 kcal/mol; combined with

the experimentally derived ZPE, we obtain TAE0=565.89 kcal/mol.

Combining this with the CODATA heats of formation of F(g) and SiF4(g), we ﬁnally

obtain ∆H ◦

f,0[Si(g)]=107.34 kcal/mol. Using the more recent ∆H ◦

f,0[SiF4(g)] instead, this

value is reduced to 107.15 kcal/mol.

In order to make an assessment of the probable error in these values, we should consider

8

both the uncertainty in the calculated TAE0 and the propagated experimental uncertain-

ties in ∆H ◦

f,0[SiF4(g)] and ∆H ◦

f,0[F(g)]. Using exactly the same method as we have em-

ployed, MdO obtained a mean absolute error of 0.22 kcal/mol for a wide variety of ﬁrst-and

second-row molecules, which dropped as low as 0.16 kcal/mol when some molecules with

signiﬁcant nondynamical correlation eﬀects were eliminated. Erring on the side of caution,

we assign 0.22 kcal/mol as a standard deviation rather than an upper limit to the error.

Given uncertainties of 0.07 and 0.20 kcal/mol in the CODATA heats of formation for F(g)

and SiF4(g), respectively, we obtain 107.34±0.41 kcal/mol for ∆H ◦

f,0[Si(g)]. Employing the

more recent Johnson [12] ∆H ◦

f [SiF4(g)] instead, which has a smaller uncertainty, we propose
f,0[Si(g)]=107.15±0.38 kcal/mol as our ﬁnal estimate. (At 298.15 K, using the CODATA

∆H ◦

H298 − H0 functions, this corresponds to 108.19±0.38 kcal/mol.)

Our ﬁnal estimate is

in fact within the reduced error

limits of Desai

[5],

∆H ◦

f,0[Si(g)]=106.5±1.0 kcal/mol. It agrees to within combined uncertainties with the GS
value after applying CG’s relativistic correction, 107.4±0.5 kcal/mol, which suggests that the

‘spurious’ Si(cr)→Si(amorph) transition enthalpy discussed in the introduction may indeed

have been a fair estimate. In previous calculations [44,45] on SiF4 and SiCl4, respectively,

Bauschlicher and coworkers derived values of 107.5±2 and 107.8±2 kcal/mol, respectively,

in which the error bars are very conservative. In the context of a review article [38] on high-

accuracy theoretical thermochemistry, Martin recently repeated the GS calculation on SiH4

using techniques similar to those employed here, and obtained a TAE0[SiH4(g)] consistent
f,0[Si(g)]=107.55±0.5 kcal/mol if the Si(cr)→Si(amorph) phase transition enthalpy

with ∆H ◦

was indeed included. We conclude that all data support a slight increase in ∆H ◦

f,0[Si(g)] to

the 107.15±0.38 kcal/mol value proposed in the present work.

As a ﬁnal note, we consider the performance of some ‘standard’ theoretical thermochem-

istry methods for this molecule, compared to our benchmark TAEe=573.92±0.22 kcal/mol.

As noted previously [46], G2 theory [47] fails dismally, underestimating TAE0 by 8.2 kcal/mol

even as both spin-orbit splitting and scalar relativistics were neglected, which would together

9

have increased the gap by a further 3.85 kcal/mol. G3 theory [48] represents a substantial

improvement, being 2.2 kcal/mol below our value including spin-orbit corrections: applying

the scalar relativistic correction to their value (or, equivalently, deleting it from our own cal-

culation) would however increase that gap to a still substantial 4.1 kcal/mol. Interestingly,

both CBS-Q and CBS-QB3 [49] predict much higher values, 576.0 and 577.0 kcal/mol, re-

spectively. Neither value includes spin-orbit or relativistic corrections: upon applying them,

we ﬁnd that they underestimate our best result by only −1.8 and −0.8 kcal/mol, respec-

tively. Finally, the W1 theory very recently proposed by Martin and de Oliveira [30] yields

a value of 573.85 kcal/mol, only 0.07 kcal/mol below the present calibration result. (W1

theory includes both scalar relativistic and spin-orbit corrections as standard parts of the

method.)

IV. CONCLUSIONS

From an exhaustive ab initio calibration study on the SiF4 molecule, we obtain a total

atomization energy at 0 K of 565.89±0.22 kcal/mol. This value includes rather substan-

tial scalar relativistic (−1.88 kcal/mol) and atomic spin-orbit (−1.97 kcal/mol) eﬀects, as

well as more minor eﬀects of inner-shell correlation (−0.08 kcal/mol) and anharmonicity in

the zero-point energy (+0.04 kcal/mol). In combination with experimentally very precisely

known heats of formation of F(g) and SiF4(g), we obtain ∆H ◦

f,0[Si(g)]=107.15±0.38 kcal/mol
f,298[Si(g)]=108.19±0.38 kcal/mol). This conﬁrms the suggestion of Grev and Schaefer
[6] that the rather uncertain JANAF/CODATA value of 106.5±1.9 kcal/mol should be re-

(∆H ◦

vised upward, albeit to about 1 kcal/mol lower than their suggested 108.1±0.5 kcal/mol.

The revision will be relevant for future computational studies on heats of formation of sil-

icon compounds. Among standard computational thermochemistry methods, G2 and G3

theory exhibit large errors, while CBS-Q performs relatively well and the very recent W1

theory reproduces the present calibration result to 0.1 kcal/mol.

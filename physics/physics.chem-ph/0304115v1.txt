The eﬀect of three-body interatomic contributions in the equation of state of 4He are investigated.
A recent two-body potential together with the Cohen and Murrell (Chem. Phys. Lett. 260, 371
(1996)) three-body potential are applied to describe bulk helium. The triple-dipole dispersion and
exchange energies are evaluated subjected only to statistical uncertainties. An extension of the
diﬀusion Monte Carlo method is applied in order to compute very small energies diﬀerences. The
results show how the three-body contributions aﬀects the ground-state energy, the equilibrium,
melting and freezing densities.

INTRODUCTION

The unique properties of the helium systems at low temperature have attracted a continuous experimental and
theoretical interest in the investigation of their ground state potential energy.1 In the past, the construction of the
best potentials used semi-empirical methods where some parameters were obtained by ﬁts to experimental data. One
of them, the so called HFDHE2 potential of Aziz and collaborators,2 has allowed the understand of many properties
of helium in the condensed phases.3,4 Despite of small inconsistencies in this potential, it was used during a long time
in these studies. It was attractive to use an eﬀective pair-wise additive potential and avoid considering high-order
interactions among the atoms.

In the last decade, after a bound helium dimer was observed,5,6 great eﬀorts were applied to develop ab initio
methods in the description of He-He potentials.7,8 This approach was very successful; interacting energies calculated
using inﬁnite order symmetry adapted perturbation theory, Green’s function Monte Carlo results and accurate disper-
sion coeﬃcients were ﬁtted to a Tang-Tonnies model9 and produced8 to date the best characterization of the helium
potential energy.10

The use of very accurate two-body potential energies, like those oﬀered by the ab initio potentials, in the investi-
gation of bulk helium, uncovered what was known for a long time: the correct description of many of its properties
requires more general many-body potential. Among the many recent works where this situation was observed, we cite
Refs.[11,12,13].

The ﬁrst attempt to incorporate long range three-body interactions were made by Axilrod-Teller14 and Muto.15
They used third order perturbation theory to calculate the triple-dipole dispersion energy for spherical symmetric
atoms. Eﬀects of three-body exchange of electrons in trimers of helium started 10 years latter by Rosen16 using a
valance bond approach. Since the work of Jansen and collaborators17,18 it is conjectured that three-body exchange
energy is needed to understand the energy diﬀerence between the fcc and hcp crystalline structure. Many developments
occurred in the investigation of nonadditive eﬀects are reviewed in Ref.[19].

It is known that two-body interactions favor the hcp over the fcc structure. The hcp crystalline lattice is about
0,01% more stable than the corresponding fcc structure.20 The two-body interaction potentials of the rare gas in
general are very well known and the residuals errors associated to them can not be responsible for discrepancies
in the calculated ground state energy and in the favored crystalline structure. At low temperatures all rare gas
solids, but helium, crystallizes in a fcc lattice. To overcome these discrepancies higher order interactions need to
be considered. The inclusion of triple-dipole interaction improved the agreement between the experimental and
theoretical values of the ground state energy, but still left the hcp as the more estable structure. The inclusion of
higher order terms in the dispersion energy like dipole-octopole and quadrupole-quadrupole terms did not modify
the theoretical results signiﬁcantly. So far, the proposed higher-order interactions greater than three-body have given
no signiﬁcant contributions to the interatomic potential. In this context it is important to better understand the
three-body exchange interaction and have at the same time reliable ways to compute its associate energy.

As already mentioned, for the helium systems the largest and most well know part of the three-body interatomic
potential is the triple-dipole term of Axilrod-Teller-Muto. The exchange contribution is less known. It is much more
weak than the dispersion energy and might be of importance in the crystallization process. Despite of its importance,
still now, competing calculations might diﬀer by an order of magnitude21 and diﬀerent potentials forms are used for
ﬁtting theoretical results obtained in calculations of the exchange energy.

Quantum Monte Carlo methods, where quantities of interest can be computed subject only to statistical uncer-
tainties, can be very useful in the analysis and understanding of the diﬀerent contributions to the potential energy.
However straightforward use of these methods to compute small energies diﬀerences might not be possible. Results
of independent runs and their associate statistical uncertainties might render a simple energy diﬀerence meaningless.
Perturbation methods used together with quantum Monte Carlo methods still needs extrapolation22 that introduces
further uncertainties.

To be able to compute energies subject only to statistical uncertainties (avoiding extrapolation) is not only a
matter of principle but a necessity in the present case, where we have a delicate balance between energies. A better
understanding of the individual contributions of the three-body interactions are important by themself and moreover
can increase the physical content of the analytical functional forms used to ﬁt their contributions.

In this work, we have applied a recent two-body potential7 together with the three-body potential of Cohen and
Murrell23 to describe properties of bulk 4He. By developing an extension of the diﬀusion Monte Carlo (DMC) method
we are able to compute and analyze the individual contributions of the Coulomb and exchange terms of the three-body
interactions.The eﬀect of these contributions are considered in the equation of state and quantitative results show
how they aﬀect the ground-state energy, the equilibrium, melting and freezing densities.

The paper is organized as follows, in the next section we present the Hamiltonian together with the interacting
potentials used in this work. In Section III we brieﬂy describe one of the standard implementation of the Diﬀusion
Monte Carlo algorithm, then we present an extension of this algorithm. It allows the use of a single set of walkers and
reweighting to compute properties of a system of helium atoms described by diﬀerent interacting potentials. Section
IV contains details of our simulations; the results are presented in Section V. A discussion in Section VI concludes
the work.

The Hamiltonian we use to describe the system of helium atoms is given by

III. THE DIFFUSION MONTE CARLO METHOD

A. The Standard Algorithm

In almost all practical implementations of the diﬀusion Monte Carlo method25,26 we compute quantities of interest
by sampling the probability distribution f0(R) = ψG(R)ψ0(R) that depends on ψ0(R), the true ground state wave
function of the system and on a given guiding function, ψG(R).

A careful version of this method is presented by Umrigar, Nightingale and Runge.27 A slight simpler implementation
2,
could be described as follow. It is convenient to start the calculation with a set of conﬁgurations draw from
|
obtained through the Metropolis algorithm. The distribution f0(R) is sampled after an initial transient, where the
excited states components are ﬁltered. All the sampling is accomplished iteratively through the integral equation

It is correct to write the Green’s function as the product of Eq. (3.1) only up to

(τ 3). This implies that to obtain
exact results, within statistical ﬂuctuations, short times ∆τ must be used in the iterations and an extrapolation to
∆τ

0 performed (see however comments in Section IV). This is the so called short-time approximation.

O

Each conﬁguration undergoes three steps: drift, diﬀusion and branching. Very frequently a single conﬁguration
is called a walker and an iteration of all walkers a generation. For the drift step we need to compute the quantum
velocity vD. In the second step the conﬁguration diﬀuses. This is accomplished by sampling Gd. Accordingly, a walker
in R′ is propagated during a time step ∆τ to its new point R through

R = R′ + χ + D∆τ vD(R′),

where χ are normal deviates of a Gaussian function with variance 2D∆τ and zero mean.

To propagate a walker, we can change all the particle’s coordinates at once or those of a single particle at a time.
In this last case we perform N updates to propagate each walker. To improve26,28 the approximation of the Green’s
function, we only accept moves with probability

and chose ∆τ such that more than 99% of the attempted moves are accepted. This condition imposes detailed balance
on the splited Green’s function and restores this property of the exact Green’s function. Regardless of the time step,
it guarantees also a correct sampling if hypothetically we could use as ψG the exact ground state wavefunction. In
such case, this implementation of the DMC method reduces to a variational Monte Carlo calculation with trial moves
sampled from Gd.

To complete the iteration of Eq. (3.1), we compute Gb considered as a weight for the walker. At the begin of
the simulation, all the walker’s weights are assumed to be equal to one. In order to minimize ﬂuctuations in Gb, an
eﬀective time step is used.26,27 It is given by ∆τef f = ∆τ (∆ρ2
a/∆ρ2), where ∆ρ2 is the mean square displacement of
all proposed moves in the diﬀusion step and ∆ρ2
a is the related quantity when only accepted moves are considered.
Finally the weight w′ of the walker is updated to its new value w according to

w = w′Gb(R, R′).

(3.8)

After propagating all walkers we have a new generation and a sample of the probability distribution f as an
weighted average over the walkers. For reasons of eﬃciency the number of conﬁgurations used in the estimation of
f (R) ﬂuctuates according to the following branching rules. If w is greater than 2, the walker is duplicate and each
one will carry half of its weight. On the other hand if two walkers, Ri and Rj, have weights less than 0.5, only one
survives with a weight given by wi + wj. The decision of which one will survive is made by sampling r = wi/(wi + wj).
That is, we draw a random number ξ and compare it with r. If r is small than ξ we keep conﬁguration Rj, otherwise
Ri is kept. If the weight computed by Eq. (3.8) lies between 0.5 and 2, a single copy of the walker with weight w is
kepted. The values of the weights where the branching is performed certainly could be changed, we only need rules
that neither introduce bias or result in a scheme too ineﬃcient.

The number of walkers is controlled by adjusting the value of ET . This number is kept roughly constant. We have

experienced with both heuristic and automatic changes of ET as given by

where κ is a parameter, tp is the target population and cp the current population. Adjustments in ET was made
about once every 20 generations. For our purposes, the results were equivalent for both methods of changing ET .

ET = E0 + κ ln(tp/cp),

(3.9)

B. The Algorithm with Reweighting

In many situations it is interesting to compute energies diﬀerences resulting from diﬀerent interatomic potentials.
However it is not always possible to simply use results from independent runs to obtain such diﬀerences. If they are
small, statistical ﬂuctuations might well produce errors that are bigger than these diﬀerences themselves, rendering
the result meaningless. It is however possible to modify the DMC method in such a way that the same set of walkers
are used to compute quantities of interest associated to the diﬀerent potentials we want to investigate. The energies
that are obtained are correlated and thus more meaningful diﬀerences can be computed. No approximations are

5

introduced. If the actual interest is on the energies, it is not necessary to use extrapolated estimators either. What
we are proposing is to sample diﬀerent probabilities distributions functions, associated to the diﬀerent interatomic
potentials we want to investigate, by using the same set of walkers with appropriate weights. As just mentioned, the
values of the quantities of interest obtained are correlated and the errors associate with their diﬀerence reduced by
orders of magnitude. We want to call attention to the fact that although our method relay in a set of weights it can
not be related to the forward walking29 or reptation30 methods. Always that we have a generation of equilibrated
walkers, we can compute the quantities of interest without any further propagation. Moreover the weights we have
for a given walker are associate to diﬀerent interatomic potentials.

In our modiﬁed DMC method, to each walker we attach a set of weights, one for each potential we want to consider.
In our implementation of the algorithm we have attached three diﬀerent weights for each walker, one for each of the
three diﬀerent interatomic potentials used. Of course this number in the method is arbitrary. It was chosen because
of the speciﬁc aspects of many-body interactions in the interatomic potential we want to investigate. It would be
possible to use only two weights or any other convenient number of weights.

As in the standard algorithm, the calculations start with a set of walkers draw from

2. Since a single guide
|
function is use, the drift and diﬀusion steps are performed exactly as before. We compute the drift velocity vD,
generate the normal distribution of variates, update R according to Eq. (3.6) and accept it with probability paccept of
Eq. (3.7). In the present algorithm, we sample the three diﬀerent probabilities distributions in which we are interested
by completing the iteration considering three diﬀerent Gb, and updating the weights as follows.

ψG
|

To be speciﬁc let us consider a single walker just propagated to a new conﬁguration R. One of its weights, w(2)
is associate with the local energies E(2)
L (R) computed using only the Aziz two-body potential V2 in the Hamiltonian
of Eq. (2.1). The weight w(2) is updated according to Eq. (3.8) by evaluating Gb of Eq. (3.4) using the local energy
L (R). Another weight of the same walker, w(2D) is calculated with the local energy E(2D)
E(2)
(R) computed with
the Hamiltonian that uses the V2D potential of Eq. (2.2), it includes the triple-dipole contributions to the two-
body potential. The calculation of the new value of w(2D) for this walker proceeds as before. Gb in Eq. (3.4) is
evaluated employing E(2D)
(R) and the update ﬁnished according to Eq. (3.8). The third weight, w(2DJ), is associate
to the interatomic potential that includes also exchange contributions. It is computed by considering E(2DJ)
(R) that
depends on the Hamiltonian that uses the full potential V2DJ of Eq. (2.6). The update of w(2DJ) is performed along
the exact same lines already describe for the other weights. The diﬀerent values of the weights are due only to the
local energy used in their computation, i. e., to the interatomic potential employed. We remember again that the
same conﬁguration is used to compute these three weights.

After propagating all walkers, a new generation will ﬁnally be obtained by using the following branching rules. When
min(w(2), w(2D), w(2DJ)) is large than 2 the walker is duplicated and each one of the copies will carry half of the value
, w(2DJ)
of the weights: (w(2)/2, w(2D)/2, w(2DJ)/2). If two walkers, i and j have weights such that max(w(2)
)
i
and max(w(2)
) are less than 0.3, we consider each one of the weights individually. We draw a single
i + w(k)
random number ξ and make comparisons of ξ with r(2), r(2D) and r(2DJ), where r(k) = w(k)
). Three
w(2)
situations might happen: i) in all the comparisons ξ is smaller than r(k), then we keep walker i with weights
i +
w(2)
and discard walker j; ii) always ξ is greater than r(k), in this case we keep Rj
j
with the same sum of weights as above and discard Ri; iii) one of the comparisons favors a walker diﬀerent from the
other two. For deﬁniteness let say that ξ is smaller than r(2) and greater than r(2D) and r(2DJ). In this case we will
.
keep the two walkers, Ri with weights
}
These new weights are telling us that in fact we have deleted walker i from the calculations with the interatomic
potential that includes three-body interactions and walker j when we are considering only the two-body potential.
This is a bad situation in the sense that we are introducing two walkers in the calculations that will not give anymore
the correlations that we are looking for. Fortunately, if needed, the cases where this situation happens can be
systematically reduced in a simple way. It is enough to decrease the threshold value used to combine walkers (see
Section IV). Finally if one of the weights of a walker lies between 0.3 and 2, a single copy is maintained with weights
(w(2), w(2D), w(2DJ)).

It is useful to use only a single random number in the above comparisons. As expected each one of the calculations
we are performing give exactly, within statistical ﬂuctuations, the results obtained by the standard algorithm. Of
course we could use three diﬀerent random numbers in the comparison, however more frequently we would meet the
unwanted situation described in iii) of the last paragraph.

Periodically, about one every four or ﬁve generations we compute several quantities of interest. Evaluations of the
are readily obtained as weighted averages that include all the walkers Ri of the

Together with these quantities we have also evaluated the energy associate only to the damped triple-dipole term in
the interatomic potential

and the energy associate with the exchange term VJ

As already mentioned the computation of these values are straightforward because we have already estimates of the
exact energies E(k)
m , no extrapolations are needed. Along the runs, averages of these quantities are formed and their
estimates and associate errors obtained.

In the investigation of the properties of bulk helium we impose periodic boundary conditions. The cutoﬀ convention,
the distance beyond which a potential is set to zero, is enforced for all interactions at half of the box size, L/2.
Distances between pairs of particles are computed by the minimum-image convention. When considering three-body
interatomic interactions, the length of the third side of the triangles formed by the particles can not in general be
computed using the minimum-image convention. A modiﬁcation needs to be introduced so that the length of this
side can be computed in a proper way and discarded if greater than L/2. To be speciﬁc let us consider particles i, j
and k. We compute distances rij and rik using the minimum-image convention. The diﬀerence in the x coordinates
of the associated particles are

where the translation vector t is deﬁned as

and [x] is the closest integer to x. If the diﬀerence xjk of the third side is computed as31

it is not hard to see that all possibilities in the simulation box are taken into account and the right value of the
distance can be obtained. If this value is little than L/2 the calculation for this triangle proceeds. For the y and z
coordinates a similar approach is used and then the three-body interaction is computed if all sides for this triangle
are lower than L/2. The calculation continues until all triangles have been considered.

The diﬀusion Monte Carlo calculations started with an initial set of 400 conﬁgurations, previously draw from

2
|
using the Metropolis algorithm. Before accumulating quantities of interest the excited states components of our
ensemble of conﬁgurations are ﬁltered by performing several iterations of Eq. (3.1). This “equilibration” is typically
of the order of 400 generations, and depends on the system density.

All guiding functions were previously optimized by performing variational calculations. Although this is a conve-
nient way of obtaining the values of the parameters, in principle they could be obtained without performating such
calculations. It would be enough to chose parameters values that give the fastest ﬁltering of the excited states of the
initial conﬁgurations.

The time steps ∆τ used in the calculations depends on the density. Their values vary within the range 0.001 to
0.002 (K−1) in order to obtain more than 99% of acceptance of the attempted moves. We also observed that at this
acceptance level, the extrapolation to ∆τ
0 of the energies values were in excellent agreement, within statistical
ﬂuctuations, to the actual values obtained in the calculation itself.

→

The quantities reported in this work were obtained by forming averages with about 500 estimates. Each estimate
was performed after 4 generations. Blocking was used in order to avoid correlations in the calculations of the variances.
The number of walkers during the simulations did not change by more than 10%.

We have considered systems with 108 particles in the solid phase. In the liquid phase we have considered 64 particles.
At ρ0 = 21.86 nm−3 to estimate size eﬀects we have also performed simulations with 108 particles. Tail corrections of
the two-body potential energy were made by assuming a pair distribution function equal to one beyond half the size of
the simulation cell and integrating the potential up to inﬁnity. No tail corrections were performed for the high-order
interactions. For the Axilrod-Teller interaction, the tail correction is less than 7% of its value at ρ0 = 21.86 nm−3
(see next section and Table II). This value is in rough agreement with a previous estimate of this quantity.32 For the
exchange energy the relative tail correction is bigger than the one of the dispersion energy. However it should remain
within the statistical uncertainty of our results (see Tables I and II).

The situation where we have a walkers with one of its weights equal to zero destroys the correlation we want to
construct. If we combine walkers when all their weights is less or equal 0.3, we noticed that the number of walkers
with at least one of weights equal zero does not exceed 2% of their total number. If needed this fraction can be
further and systematically reduced by using a threshold smaller than 0.3 to combine walkers. As we have observed in
our calculations, this is done at expense of a less eﬃcient calculation. We have concluded that the threshold 0.3 for
combination of walkers is perfectly reasonable for our purposes.

V. RESULTS

A. Liquid phase

We conducted several independent runs at four diﬀerent densities ρ of liquid helium, 19.64 nm−3, at the experimental
equilibrium density ρ0 = 21.86 nm−3, 24.01 nm−3 and at 26.23 nm−3. In Table I are shown the total energies obtained
using the two-body potential V2, the V2D potential of Eq.(2.2), the V2 potential plus the Axilrod-Teller term, and the
V2DJ potential of Eq.(2.6), the exchange term added to the V2D potential.

It is important to note that since the energies associated with these potentials are calculated with a single set of
walkers, they are correlated. We can believe that the results show their evolution as more elaborated interacting
potentials are used, despite of the statistical uncertainties in the results.

In Table II we shown very accurate calculations of the Axilrod-Teller and exchange energies at these four densities.
For comparison we show also extrapolated results of perturbative calculations performed using conﬁgurations gen-
erated with the V2 potential. We have plot these results in Figures 1 and 2. The Axilrod-Teller energies calculated
using reweighting are greater than the extrapolated perturbative results. Moreover they do not always agree within
the statistical uncertainty. The triple-dipole interaction gives a positive contribution to the energy of the system and
its value double when we go from the lowest to the highest density.

The energies due to the exchange term in the V2DJ potential when calculated with respect to the total energies
obtained with the V2D potential are on average about 0.0010 K smaller than the extrapolated perturbative results. In
addition there is no agreement within statistical uncertainties between the energies calculated with the reweighting
and perturbative methods at ρ = 19.64 and ρ = 24.01 nm−3. The energies calculated using reweighting are lower
than the extrapolated perturbative results, contrary to what happens with the triple-dipole interaction. The exchange
energy is also positive at all densities examined and increases with it. At the highest density it is approximately 50%
greater than in the lowest one.

B. Solid phase

8

For the solid phase we have considered four densities: 29.34, 32.88, 33.54 and 35.27 nm−3. In Table I are shown the
total energies, obtained with a systems of 108 particles in a fcc structure. Again, we have considered the potentials
V2, V2D and V2DJ . Table II shown our very accurate results of the Axilrod-Teller and exchange contributions to
the potential energy and also extrapolated perturbative results for comparison. The diﬀerence is about the same we
have observed in the liquid phase. For the Axilrod-Teller term they do not agree within the statistical uncertainty
at ρ equal to 32.88 and 35.27 nm−3. In this phase as well, the Axilrod-Teller energies computed by reweighting are
greater than the corresponding extrapolated perturbative results, and they remain positive. They also increase with
the density. At the highest density (35.27 nm−3) it is 60% greater than in the lowest one.

The contribution of the exchange term in the solid region is null or negative and diﬀers signiﬁcantly from the
perturbative results. At the lowest density (29.34 nm−3) the result obtained by reweighting gives a null contribution
while the extrapolated perturbative quantity is positive. In the other densities the exchange energy computed by
reweighting continues to be lower than the corresponding extrapolated perturbative values that are negative. In the
solid phase the relative variation of the exchange energy is greater than the corresponding quantity for the damped
Axilrod-Teller energy.

C. Melting-Freezing Transition

In order to follow the variations of the melting and freezing densities with the interacting potentials, we used a
Maxwell (double-tangent) construction in analytical equations of state for the liquid and crystalline phases. The
equations were determined by ﬁts of our results to functions of the form

E(ρ) = E0 + B(

) + C(

ρ

ρ0

−

).

−
ρ0

(5.1)

This functional form has been extensively used in the literature, including to ﬁt experimental equation of state.33,34
We have ﬁtted equations of state using results from the three diﬀerent potentials, V2, V2D and V2DJ . The ﬁtted
parameters, E0, B, C and ρ0 in the liquid and solid phases are presented in Table III for these potentials. In Fig. 3
we display results for the equations of state for the three potentials.

The freezing and melting densities determined by the Maxwell double tangent construction are listed in Table IV.
Looking at this table, we can follow the changes in the freezing and melting densities as more elaborated interacting
potentials are used. The computed freezing densities diﬀers, about 3% from the experimental value. This diﬀerence
is of about 4% for the melting densities. The calculated freezing densities are below the experimental value, contrary
to the computed melting densities that are above the experimental value.

VI. DISCUSSION

In this work we are able to verify without any approximations how small changes in the interacting potential aﬀects
some of the properties of bulk helium. It was possible to analyze how the Axilrod-Teller and the exchange three-body
contributions to the interatomic potential modify the equation of state of this system. This was accomplished by
using a single set of walkers with reweighting in a DMC calculation. The quantities of interest associate with the
diﬀerent potentials were obtained in a correlated fashion and so despite of the statistical errors their diﬀerence are
meaningful.

The total energies per atom presented in Table I show us that since our two-body potential is very accurate, high
order terms in the description of the atomic interaction are needed. In the same token, as the contributions of the
dispersion energy are much better known than those of the exchange energy, the results suggest that more eﬀorts
would be desirable in developing reliable ways of computing the energies associated to this last kind of interaction.

The results of the Axilrod-Teller triple-dipole dispersion energy and of the three-body exchange energy as a function
of the density reported in Table II, Figures 1 and 2, show qualitative agreement between the two methods we use in
the calculations. However the usual approach of extrapolating perturbative calculations (made with conﬁgurations
generated by the DMC method using a two-body potential) not always can be trusted in giving the right magnitude of
this quantity. In some cases the results do not agree within statistical uncertainty with those obtained using reweight.
This might be due to the simple functions used for extrapolation:
functions of the Jastrow and Jastrow-Nosanov
form, for the liquid and solid phases respectively. As expected, in both liquid and solid phases, the Axilrod-Teller
term gives more important energy contribution to the total energy than the exchange term. Also it is interesting to
note that at the lowest solid density we have considered (29.34 nm−3), the extrapolated perturbative result associated
with the exchange term gives a positive energy contribution whereas the value obtained by reweighting is null.

9

Although the inclusion of the three-body interaction potentials used in this paper do not greatly modiﬁes the melting
and freezing densities, it is important to note that our calculations show that the inclusion of the triple-dipole and
the exchange terms, as proposed by Cohen and Murell,23 are leading the melting and freezing densities to their right
values. All the small diﬀerences we observe in these quantities are within their estimate error (0.2 nm−3). However
since we used a single set of walkers to compute them, we can trust that their relative diﬀerence are signiﬁcant in our
calculations. Other consequence of including many body interactions in the potential can be seen in the calculation of
the equilibrium density (Table III, Eq. (5.1)). For both potentials, V2D and V2DJ , the theoretical computed value of
the equilibrium density becomes almost identical to the experimental value. The equilibrium density obtained using
the full interatomic potential V2DJ diminished 0.3 nm−3 from its value computed with the two-body potential. In the
solid phase, in which the contribution of the exchange energy is greater, the parameter ρ0 decreases 0.75 nm−3 in a
similar comparison.

The inclusion of three-body terms in the interatomic potential improves the agreement between computed and
experimental values of properties like the binding energy, the equilibrium, melting and freezing densities. The results
suggest that more reliable analytical expressions are needed for the calculation of the exchange energy in bulk helium.
We could reach these conclusions by introducting reweighting in a DMC calculation, where a single set of walkers is
used to compute properties associated to diﬀerent potentials. Moreover we are able to calculate the energies associated
to these potentials without extrapolation.

The extension we have proposed to the DMC method might be very useful not only for the helium systems, but
also for other quantum many-body systems where a clue is need to identify the best description between competing
interacting potentials. Even if these potentials diﬀer by very small amounts, the nature of the interactions they
describe can be diﬀerent. A better understanding of these diﬀerences and their relevance will enlarge our knowledge
about the interactions and so about these systems themselves. The questions discussed in this work are not the only
instance where the reweighting technique might be useful. The calculations of small energy contributions of spin-orbit
terms in molecular physics35 might be another situation where this method can help in a better understanding of a
physical system.

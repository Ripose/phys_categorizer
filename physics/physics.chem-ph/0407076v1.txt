We discuss the application of the Discrete Variable Representation to Schr¨odinger problems which
involve singular Hamiltonians. Unlike recent authors who invoke transformations to rid the eigen-
value equation of singularities at the cost of added complexity, we show that an approach based
solely on an orthogonal polynomial basis is adequate, provided the Gauss-Lobatto or Gauss-Radau
quadrature rule is used. This ensures that the mesh contains the singular points and by simply dis-
carding the DVR functions corresponding to those points, all matrix elements become well-behaved,
the boundary conditions are satisﬁed and the calculation is rapidly convergent. The accuracy of the
method is demonstrated by applying it to the hydrogen atom. We emphasize that the method is
equally capable of describing bound states and continuum solutions.

INTRODUCTION

The Discrete Variable Representation (DVR) [1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6] is one of the most eﬀective and widely used meth-
ods for discretizing the Schr¨odinger equation. In its most
elemental form, it has the virtues of maintaining the lo-
cality of operators which are local in space, and the rapid
convergence of a spectral method. In addition, for multi-
dimensional problems it leads to a sparse matrix repre-
sentation of the Hamiltonian, which may be used quite
eﬀectively when coupled to iterative techniques designed
to solve large sets of linear equations or to extract the
lowest eigenvalues of large matrices. A recent variant
of the method, which combines the DVR with a ﬁnite
element method [7], has been used to solve one of the
most intractable problems in atomic scattering theory,
the impact ionization of the hydrogen atom. Lately, the
technique has been combined with the Arnoldi/Lanczos
approach to produce an extremely eﬃcient method for
the solution of the time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation
[8].

The purpose of this note is to correct some misconcep-
tions concerning the application of the method to prob-
lems involving singular potentials. These issues appear
to arise when it is apparent that the boundary condi-
tions satisﬁed by the solution to the Schr¨odinger equa-
tion should not lead to any numerical diﬃculties. A
number of authors [3, 9, 10, 11] have provided ”reme-
dies” to remove the singularities and to transform the
original Schr¨odinger equation in to a more tractable and
rapidly converging form. Unfortunately, these transfor-

mations often destroy the natural symmetry of the orig-
inal equations and lead to more complex algebraic solu-
tion methods than is really necessary. Here we present an
alternative approach, which addresses the problem more
transparently leading to a simpler numerical procedure
with no loss of accuracy. Section II is a summary of the
key elements of the DVR method, and in section III we
present our approach for applying this methodology to
singular Hamiltonians. We end in section IV with a brief
conclusion.

II. DISCRETE VARIABLE REPRESENTATION

Since the DVR has been discussed extensively [1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6] in the literature, we provide only the essentials
here. A DVR exists when there is both a spectral basis
of N functions, φi(x), orthogonal over a range [a,b] with
weightfunction w(x)

Z

w(x)φ∗

n(x)φm(x)dx = δm,n,

(1)

and an associated quadrature rule with N points, xi and
weights, wi which enable a set of coordinate eigenfunc-
tions ui(x) to be deﬁned with the following properties,

ui(x) =

There are two important features to note. First, the coor-
dinate eigenfunctions are deﬁned as continuous functions
of the spectral basis. When this basis is polynomial the
sum in Eq.(3b) can be carried out exactly, and the coor-
dinate eigenfunctions can be expressed as

the Lagrange interpolating functions at the quadrature
points. With either representation, they may be easily
diﬀerentiated analytically. Second, the expansion coeﬃ-
cients, cn, are computed using the quadrature rule. Im-
plicit in using the quadrature rule for the evaluation of
cn is that the result is accurate. This is not guaran-
teed except for certain cases. For example, when φi(x)
is one of the classical orthogonal functions, there is an
associated Gauss quadrature [12] which guarantees that
Eq.(3) is exact when the integrand is a polynomial of
1) or less. There are other examples such
degree (2N
as particle-in-a-box or Fourier functions, which are not
polynomials, but which can be shown to exactly satisfy
Eq.(3) with an appropriately chosen quadrature rule. In
all of these cases there exists a unitary transformation
between the original spectral and coordinate basis. Since
the coordinate functions diagonalize the coordinate op-
erator, any function of the coordinates is also diagonal.
This is very convenient for actual calculations and gives
the DVR calculation many of the desirable properties
of a grid based method with few of the disadvantages.
It should also be noted that matrix elements of the ki-
netic energy operator while not diagonal in the coordi-
nate basis may be evaluated simply and exactly using
the quadrature rule or analytically. Since the kinetic en-
ergy part of the Hamiltonian matrix is a separable sum
over particle and coordinate variables, a product DVR
basis leads to a sparse representation. When the inter-
val [a,b], is inﬁnite or semi-inﬁnite, the weight function,
w(x), insures that the wavefunction will decay properly
at large distances. For ﬁnite intervals, boundary condi-
tions may be enforced by requiring that the wavefunction
or its derivative behave correctly at the left and/or right
boundary.

There is a simple, but quite useful generalization of
Gauss quadratures that will be needed in what follows.

It is possible to specify in advance that some of the
points are ﬁxed. When these points are either or both
of the endpoints of a ﬁnite interval, the quadrature rule
is termed a Gauss-Radau or Gauss-Lobatto quadrature,
respectively. The remaining Gauss points may be de-
termined by a simple modiﬁcation of the original pro-
Since one or two points are now ﬁxed,

the quadrature is of lower accuracy than the full Gauss
quadrature, but the great advantage of being able to sat-
isfy speciﬁc boundary conditions at the endpoints, far
outweighs this disadvantage.

III. SINGULAR HAMILTONIANS

Consider the radial Schr¨odinger equation,

l(l + 1)

2r2 + v(r)

−

E

ψ(r) = 0

(5)

(cid:3)

where we assume that v(r) vanishes for large r and is
singular at the origin. The radial function satisﬁes the
boundary condition ψ(0) = 0, and either exponentially
decays or oscillates for large r. Here we will oﬀer two
alternative approaches to solving Eq.(5) To motivate the
discussion, recall that Baye and Heenen [3] suggest that
for the case of exponentially decaying boundary condi-
tions, one very natural choice for the spectral functions
is,

φn(r) = rl+1 exp(

r/2)L2l+2

n

(r)

where Lα
n(r) are the generalized Laguerre polynomials.
When this basis is used for the coulomb potential, the
results are quite disappointing. The relative error in the
ground state energy with ten basis functions is about
10−3. This appears to be simply related to the choice
5
of r2 exp(
r) as the weight function. While this choice
does result in a set of coordinate functions which satisfy
both boundary conditions, it gives rise to a potential en-
ergy matrix element which does not behave as a polyno-
mial times the weight function. In fact, the integrand has
terms which behave as inverse powers of r. Vincke, Male-
gat and Baye [9] propose a simple procedure to remedy
the problem. They regularize the problem by multiplying
the Schr¨odinger equation by ρ(r), where, ρ(r) is chosen
so that, ρ(r)v(r) = constant as r = 0. Using, for exam-
ple, ρ(r) = r2, leads to a generalized eigenvalue problem
with a modiﬁed kinetic energy matrix based on Laguerre
polynomials with α = 0. Here we suggest a more direct
attack. First, we do not transform the Schr¨odinger equa-
tion. We use the Laguerre polynomials with α = 0, that
is, with a weight function, exp(
r), but choose the points
and weights of the quadrature by the Gauss-Radau rule
with r = 0 as the ﬁxed point. The set of resulting DVR
functions all satisfy the boundary conditions at inﬁnity
and due to the Kronecker delta function property (2b)
all but the ﬁrst DVR function also satisfy the bound-
ary condition at the origin, that is, they lead oﬀ as r.

FIG. 1: Relative error on the ﬁrst ten l = 0 eigenstates of
hydrogen using a Gauss-Laguerre basis with no scaling (h=1).
The points indicate the results obtained using the method
of this paper for N = 20 (•), N = 50 (◮), and N = 100
((cid:4)). The lines represent the relative error obtained using the
regularized Lagrange mesh method of Vincke et. al. [9] for
N = 20 (solid), N = 50 (dots), and N = 100 (dashed).

The ﬁrst basis function is then simply dropped from the
expansion. The resulting matrix elements of the Hamil-
tonian are all exactly integrated by the quadrature rule
and quite well behaved.

We have applied our method to the spectrum of the
hydrogen atom. In Fig. 1 we show the relative error ε,
on the ﬁrst ten eigenstates with l = 0 for various basis set
sizes. For comparison we also plot the results obtained
when using the regularized mesh technique of Vincke et.
al. (with scaling factor h = 1, see [9]). In addition to
its greater simplicity the accuracy of our method is equal
or superior to that of the regularized mesh technique.
Moreover, since all basis functions vanish at the origin,
our method works equally well for ﬁnite values of the
angular momentum, as long as the wavefunction is well
localized within the interval.

A second approach, which works for both the bound
and continuous spectrum, places the system in a large

3

box of radius, r = a. The DVR basis is deﬁned using
the Gauss-Legendre-Lobatto quadrature rule. By ensur-
ing that the two endpoints are part of the quadrature, it
becomes trivial to satisfy the boundary conditions. Drop-
ping the DVR function at the origin, guarantees that the
solution will vanish at r = 0.
If the DVR function at
the last point is dropped, the solution will go to zero at
r = a and simulate exponentially decaying solutions. By
retaining the DVR function at the last point and adding
a Bloch operator,

L =

(7)

to the Hamiltonian, it is possible to deal with non-ﬁxed
node boundary conditions at the right endpoint and sim-
ulate scattering boundary conditions. For long range po-
tentials, such as the coulomb potential, it is necessary to
make sure that the results are not box size dependent.
Stated diﬀerently, one must examine the convergence of
the eigenvalues with respect to basis set and box size.
This is clearly evidenced in Tables I-III where one sees
convergence to eigenvalues of the truncated coulomb po-
tential when the size of the box is too small. By sys-
tematically increasing the box size and the basis, it is
possible to obtain the eigenvalues to arbitrary accuracy.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

Previous researchers have developed DVR techniques
that require special treatment of singular potentials or
non-polynomial based quadratures. Here we have demon-
strated that a judicious use of the orthogonal polyno-
mial approach, using the Gauss-Lobatto quadrature rule,
avoids the need to transform the Schr¨odinger equation
into a form which is numerically less tractable. In addi-
tion, the method is applicable to all types of boundary
conditions and is able to treat the bound and continu-
ous spectrum on equal footing. As a ﬁnal note, using
the ﬁnite element DVR, enables one to treat singulari-
ties or even discontinuities [7] at interior points, if they
are known in advance, by chosing the boundaries of the
elements at those points.

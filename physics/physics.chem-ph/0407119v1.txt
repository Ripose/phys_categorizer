Clusters of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules are modelled using explicit all-atom
potentials using a rigid body approximation. The PAH’s considered range from pyrene (C10H8) to
circumcoronene (C54H18), and clusters containing between 2 and 32 molecules are investigated. In
addition to the usual repulsion-dispersion interactions, electrostatic point-charge interactions are
incorporated, as obtained from density functional theory calculations. The general electrostatic
distribution in neutral or singly charged PAH’s is reproduced well using a ﬂuctuating charges anal-
ysis, which provides an adequate description of the multipolar distribution. Global optimization is
performed using a variety of methods, including basin-hopping and parallel tempering Monte Carlo.
We ﬁnd evidence that stacking the PAH molecules generally yields the most stable motif. A struc-
tural transition between one-dimensional stacks and three-dimensional shapes built from mutiple
stacks is observed at larger sizes, and the threshold for this transition increases with the size of
the monomer. Larger aggregates seem to evolve toward the packing observed for benzene in bulk.
Diﬃculties met in optimizing these clusters are analysed in terms of the strong anisotropy of the
molecules. We also discuss segregation in heterogeneous clusters and vibrational properties in the
context of astrophysical observations.

INTRODUCTION

Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH’s) have been
proposed as the carriers of a family of interstellar aro-
matic infrared bands (AIB’s), observed in many astro-
nomical objects.1,2 The most intense of these bands,
found near 3030, 1610, 1315–1282, 1150 and 885 cm−1
respectively, are observed systematically from diﬀerent
regions of the interstellar medium heated by starlight.
The intensity of these features suggests that PAH’s are
the most abundant complex polyatomic molecules in the
interstellar medium, accounting perhaps for as much
as 20% of all carbon in our galaxy.3 Many laboratory
studies4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14 and quantum chemical calcu-
lations or models15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24 of single PAH
molecules have been performed in the past, but none
has yet provided convincing evidence that single PAH
molecules are actually present in the interstellar medium.
This result is likely due to the speciﬁc nature of the in-
terstellar species, in relation to their formation mech-
anism and further processes such as photodissociation.
Boulanger et al.25 and Bernard et al.26 suggested that
the observed free-ﬂying PAH’s are produced by photoe-
vaporation of larger grains. Cesarsky et al.27 attributed
the presence of an infrared continuum observed in the
reﬂection nebula CED 201 to very small carbonaceous

grains eventually leading to the AIB’s carriers. In recent
work, Rapacioli et al.28 presented strong evidence that
these grains are PAH clusters, and a typical lower size of
400 carbons per cluster was inferred.

Generally speaking, very little is known about
the structure of PAH clusters.
In comparison, as-
semblies of benzene molecules have received much
more attention.29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41 At empir-
ical levels of theory, van de Waal29,30 and the groups
of Stace,31 Bartell36 and Whetten and Easter37,38,39
have investigated assemblies containing up to 13 ben-
zene molecules. These studies showed a marked prefer-
ence for the Wefelmeier growth scheme42 also observed
in argon clusters.43 The (benzene)13 cluster, in particu-
lar, was shown to exhibit very stable icosahedral-based
structures,39 some of which have received experimental
support. At more sophisticated levels, electronic struc-
ture calculations have also been performed by several
authors.33,34,35,40,44 The cationic species (C6H6)+
n have
been investigated experimentally from ion mobility mea-
surements by Rusyniak et al.41 These authors also per-
formed structural optimization using the OPLS force
ﬁeld.45

Naphthalene clusters have been studied by van de
Waal,29 who identiﬁed patterns similar to benzene clus-
ters. More recently, the structure of the naphtha-

lene trimer obtained from experimental studies46 was
shown to agree well with one derived from ab initio
calculations.47

Anthracene clusters containing up to 5 molecules were
investigated theoretically and experimentally by Piuzzi
and coworkers.48 Despite their relatively small size, these
clusters seem to show quite diﬀerent structures, forming
a mainly two-dimensional pattern in which the long axes
of the molecules are aligned, their centers of mass lying in
the same perpendicular plane. Song and coworkers49 re-
ported mass spectrometry measurements for anionic clus-
ters containing up to 16 anthracene molecules.

Heterogeneous clusters made of one or several benzene
molecules and a single naphthalene, anthracene, pery-
lene or tetracene molecule have been studied, sometimes
in the presence of a solvent.50,51 Data for larger PAH
molecules is signiﬁcantly more scarce. The coronene
and circumcoronene dimers were investigated by Miller
and coworkers.52 Aggregates of PAH molecules were as-
sumed by Seahra and Duley53 to form stacks. These
authors used data from graphite to estimate some trans-
lational vibrational modes of stacked PAH’s. However,
this assumption did not employ any atomistic modelling.
Marzec,54 using an extension of the MM2 force ﬁeld55
and semi-empirical quantum mechanical approaches, per-
formed local optimizations of stacked structures contain-
ing up to 6 molecules.
In this study, the stacks were
shown to be stable for PAH’s ranging from dibenzopy-
rene to dicoronene.54 Perlstein56 investigated the transi-
tion from one-dimensional stacks to monolayers and crys-
tal packings of various molecular species, also using the
MM2 classical potential.

While bulk polyaromatic compounds are very diﬃcult
to study experimentally, nearly pure macroscopic sam-
ples of hexabenzocoronene molecules were shown to form
a twinned crystal.57 Crystallization via epitaxial growth
over a graphite surface has also been reported.58 Com-
puter simulations results by Khanna and coworkers59
indicate that large sets of coronene or circumcoronene
molecules do indeed crystallise and melt through a ﬁrst-
order process without exhibiting intermediate liquid crys-
tal behavior. More generally, the bulk phases of PAH
molecules can be expected to show similar phase dia-
grams as the model discotic particles studied by several
authors.60,61,62

Our present interest lies in the size range between the
very small and very large sizes, for aggregates contain-
ing about 1000 carbon atoms. We wish to address the
following questions:

(i) Are the stacks of PAH molecules actually the most

stable form for clusters?

(ii) How large can these stacks be as a function of the

PAH monomer size?

(iii) How does the cluster structure evolve toward the

bulk morphology?

2

In addition to these main concerns, we intend to address
not only clusters of the same PAH molecule, but also
some heterogeneous assemblies, as the experimental sit-
uation we are referring to does not have restrictions on
the variety of PAH’s involved.

Locating the most stable structures of molecular clus-
ters can be quite diﬃcult.63,64,65 For example, water clus-
ters have been found to exhibit a multi-funnel potential
energy surface,63,66,67 where numerous low energy min-
ima exist, but can only be interconnected by long path-
ways. Global optimization is signiﬁcantly harder for rigid
body water clusters than for most atomic clusters with a
comparable number of degrees of freedom.63 PAH clus-
ters, which are made of very anisotropic monomers, rep-
resent a novel challenge for molecular optimization, some-
where in between the diﬃculties associated with atomic
clusters and those of biological molecules.68

In the present work, we have attempted to locate the
stable structures of assemblies of relatively large PAH
molecules ranging from pyrene to circumcoronene. We
combine results from electronic structure calculations
and atomistic modelling to describe the intermolecular
interactions, within a rigid body approximation for the
PAH molecules. Global optimization using the basin-
hopping69,70 and parallel tempering71 Monte Carlo meth-
ods then provide estimates of the most stable isomers, for
clusters containing up to 32 molecules.

The paper is organized as follows. In the next section,
we give the basic description of our model, as well as some
details about the electronic structure calculations and the
optimization procedure. Section III presents our results
for the structures, starting with the dimers. A more de-
tailed analysis is provided in the case of coronene clusters,
and the relative stability of some important structural
motifs is investigated. Sec. III ends with some results for
heterogeneous clusters. In Sec. IV we brieﬂy discuss in-
termolecular vibrational modes. We comment in Section
V on the diﬃculties encountered in our global optimiza-
tion approach and in the robustness of our results with
respect to the quality of the atomistic modelling. Finally,
we summarize and discuss the astrophysical relevance of
our results in Sec. VI.

II. METHODS

Our goal here is to provide good candidates for the
most stable structures of clusters of PAH molecules.
These structures are expected to be relevant at very low
temperatures, where intramolecular vibrations are un-
likely to be excited. This legitimises our main approxi-
mation that the PAH molecules can be treated as rigid
bodies.

range from 2 to 32 depending on the monomer, so we will
be dealing with a rather large number of atoms. Con-
sidering the known diﬃculty of global optimization,68 it
seems obvious that the atomistic modelling should be
limited to a moderate numerical cost—but retaining the
important chemical features. In particular, the multipo-
lar electrostatic description employed in Ref. 48 is not ap-
propriate for an initial survey, although such ideas could
provide useful corrections. Following previous eﬀorts on
benzene clusters by several groups,29,31,36,38,39 we have
chosen to describe the intermolecular potential in PAH
clusters as the result of two contributions:

B. DFT calculations and electrostatic modelling

The molecular geometries and partial charges were ini-
tially determined from electronic structure calculations
on PAH monomers. The molecular geometries were those
determined in tight-binding calculations. The partial
atomic charges were initially determined from electronic
structure calculations using the B3LYP hybrid functional
and the Gaussian03 package.72 Those calculations were
carried out using core pseudopotentials on carbon as de-
termined by Durand and Barthelat,73 and tabulated in
semi-local form by Bouteiller et al.74 The gaussian type
orbital (GTO) basis set used was [4s/4p/1d] contracted
into [31/31/1] on the carbon atoms and [4s/1p] con-
tracted into [31/1] on the hydrogen atoms. The basis
sets are speciﬁed fully in table I.

In addition to the neutral PAH molecules, calculations
were also performed on the singly charged anions and
cations at the neutral geometry. These results allow us
to investigate the relative stability of zwitterionic species.
The extraction of point atomic charges from ab initio
calculations is rather problematic since charges are not
uniquely deﬁned. The well-known Mulliken deﬁnition75

faces the overlap problem and the corresponding results
may depend strongly on the basis set. Other deﬁnitions
of atomic charges can be found, such as the natural bond
orbital (NBO) deﬁnition76 or the Bader deﬁnition,77 in
which the charges are determined from the topology as-
sociated with the density. For the present purpose how-
ever, since the charges are essentially used to extract an
intermolecular potential rather than describing the in-
tramolecular bonding, we choose to compute the charges
which best ﬁts the actual electrostatic potential on the
van der Waals surface associated with each molecule.
This choice is similar to the strategy followed by Piuzzi
and coworkers,48 which provided reasonable results for
the anthracene dimer by consistently reproducing the ab
initio interaction energies for various relative orientations
of the molecules.

The ﬁtted charges were determined here using the
Gaussian03 package for all the species mentioned above.
As expected, the electrostatic potential ﬁtted (EPF)
charges are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from those given by the
Mulliken analysis. They show more continuity from one
PAH to one another, especially in terms of the popula-
tions on hydrogens with respect to carbon atoms. With
the present basis set, the Mulliken analysis often leads to
negative charges on hydrogen atoms, whereas both NBO
and EPF charges for neutral PAH’s are always positive
on hydrogen. Table II illustrates the values obtained for
coronene. The other PAH’s behave similarly, except that
they show larger ﬂuctuations within a given molecule,
especially when the symmetry is lower.

After the charges were determined, a simple electro-
static model was constructed to rationalize the DFT re-
sults. The model is similar to the charge equilibration
scheme of Mortier et al.,78 and also to the ﬂuctuating
charges model of Rapp´e and Goddard.79 Interestingly,
some links between DFT and ﬂuctuating charges poten-
tials have been established.80 Brieﬂy, at a given molecular
geometry the atomic charges {qi} are deﬁned in order to
minimize the global electrostatic energy under the con-

the total charge is constant and equal to Q0. This elec-
trostatic model has only 4 parameters, namely εC − εH,
UC = γCC, UH = γHH, and γCH. These parameters were
optimized to reproduce the partial charges of the neutral
coronene molecule, as obtained from density functional
calculations. We found the charges carried by the atoms
of all other PAH molecules to be very satisfactorily re-
produced by this model, always within 5%, not only for
neutrals, but also for anionic or cationic PAH’s. There-
fore, the complete electrostatic atomistic description is
gathered into the parameters of this simple model, which
read εC − εH = 1.86 eV, UC = 0.98 eV, UH = 1.65 eV,
and γCH = 2.11 eV.
Before going on,

it is important to notice that the
present ﬂuctuating charges model not only accounts for
(ﬁrst-order) Coulombic interactions. The charges ob-
tained are intrinsically the solution of a linear many-body
equation, and the resulting energy incorporates polariza-
tion eﬀects. In addition to providing all the important
electrostatic characteristics of the single molecule, the
ﬂuctuating charges model can be extended to treat an
assembly of PAH molecules. For this purpose, Eq. (2)
must be extended to include interactions between all the
atoms, and the conservation of total charge over each
molecule is achieved through the introduction of a cor-
responding number of Lagrange multipliers.81 In princi-
ple, charge transfer among a limited or complete set of
molecules could also be investigated, but we have not
considered this possibility here.

Allowing charges to ﬂuctuate within a PAH cluster has
a very heavy computational cost, which turned out to
be incompatible with performing large scale optimiza-
tion. We therefore restricted the model to ﬁxed charges.
However, for some of the typical equilibrium structures
we found, we checked that the assembly of several PAH
molecules was consistent with the ﬁxed charges approxi-

4

mation. To do this we computed the average h|qiα −q(0)
iα |i
over all atoms and all molecules from the charges {q(0)
iα } in
the single molecules and their values {qiα} in the relaxed
cluster. For all clusters investigated, the average charge
always remained lower than 0.1%. Obviously, at ﬁnite
temperatures intramolecular vibrations are likely to in-
duce signiﬁcant variations in the eﬀective atomic charges,
and the ﬁxed charges approximation will become less ac-
curate.

C. Global optimization

We attempted to locate good candidates for the global
minima of PAH clusters using several methods. The
basin-hopping (BH), or Monte Carlo plus minimization
method69,70 was used, especially for the smaller clusters.
This unbiased algorithm performs a random walk on the
transformed potential energy surface, which consists only
of the local minima. This walk requires quenches to be
carried out after each molecular displacement. Here, a
displacement means that all molecules are rotated and
translated randomly by some (rather large) amount, at
the same time.

The basin-hopping method was previously used for a
variety of other atomic70,82 and molecular63,83,84 clusters.
However, we found it rather ineﬃcient for moderately
large PAH clusters, for reasons that will be discussed
below. Therefore, we also employed parallel tempering
Monte Carlo71 as an alternative optimization tool. Even
though this method was originally designed for reduc-
ing broken ergodicity in glassy systems, it has since been
used successfully in global optimization problems.85,86 It
essentially consists in performing several MC trajecto-
ries at increasing temperatures, and allowing exchange
moves between adjacent trajectories in addition to the
standard molecular displacements. In practice, we chose
20 temperatures in the range 1 K≤ T ≤80 K. Periodic
quenches from some trajectories were also considered to
provide extra isomers. Finally, many low energy struc-
tures were found by construction from simple motifs, us-
ing the structures obtained from unbiased methods for
guidance.

The interaction between molecules is essentially ad-
ditive within our model. However, due to the strong

numerous previous results for dimers of PAH’s, we ﬁrst
focus on these species as a ﬁrst step toward larger aggre-
gates.

A. Dimers

The D6h coronene molecule provides a convenient ex-
ample of large PAH’s, especially from the computational
point of view. The most stable structures of its dimer are
shown in Fig. 1, (a) and (b). These structures are per-

fect stacks, in the sense that the sixfold axes and molec-
ular planes are parallel. A detailed analysis of the var-
ious contributions to the binding energy shows that the
repulsion-dispersion between carbon atoms dominates.
Therefore it may be energetically favorable to shift the
molecules along some parallel displacement, or to rotate
them around their common sixfold axis. The resulting
structures show an increase in the number of nearest
neighbors, but the parallel displaced geometry is slightly
penalized at its edges due to fewer van der Waals bonds
involving hydrogen atoms.
Interestingly, the perfectly
superimposed stack, Fig 1c, is not a true minimum but
a saddle point for our potential. This result contrasts
with that obtained by Marzec,54 who found the face-to-
face conﬁguration to be the lowest in energy. It should be
noted here that the charges used by this author, obtained
from the MINDO3 and ZINDO1 semi-empirical quantum
mechanical calculations, are signiﬁcantly lower than ours
(always between 10−3 and 10−2). However, even after
removing the electrostatic contribution from our calcula-
tion we still ﬁnd that this conformation is a saddle. This
result may indicate that the simple steepest-descent local
minimization performed in Ref. 54 did not fully converge.
A pair of pyrene molecules also exhibits stacks, as
shown in Fig. 2. The superimposed structure analogous
to (c) of Fig. 1 spontaneously transforms into a twisted
stack where the angle between the long axes is about
30◦. Another stable stack is also found with perpendicu-
lar long axes. This isomer, (b) in Fig. 2, will be denoted

as ‘staggered’ below.

Smaller aromatic molecules also display stable stacked
dimers, even though T-shaped geometries are found com-
petitive for benzene, naphthalene and anthracene.44,48,50
(Benzene)2 is slightly more stable when T-shaped, but
increasing the number of aromatic rings favors stacked
shapes.50 In both (naphthalene)2 and (anthracene)2, the
crossed stacks are marginally preferred to the parallel
displaced stacks.44,48 However, we note that, among T-
shaped conformations, those with parallel long axes show
an enhanced stability.48

The trends seen in the naphthalene and anthracene
dimers are also observed in the present work for
(coronene)2 and (pyrene)2. In the latter case, the paral-
lel displaced isomer leads to structure (a) in Fig. 2 after
minimization. In the circumcoronene dimer, not shown,
the crossed stacked structure is also the most stable, the
parallel displaced stack being 1.7 kJ/mol higher in en-
ergy. Again, the perfectly superimposed dimer is not a
stable minimum.

The favored dimer structure results from a balance be-
tween maximizing the number of weak C–C intermolecu-
lar contacts, and minimizing the Coulomb repulsion be-
tween hydrogen atoms. The gain in repulsion-dispersion
energy is larger than the Coulomb penalty in the crossed
stack relative to the parallel displaced stack. We have
also investigated cohesion in zwitterionic (PAH+PAH−)
stacks. For all the clusters investigated, the crossed
stacks were further stabilized with respect to the parallel-
displaced isomer. In these cases, the Coulomb interaction
becomes strongly attractive instead of being slightly re-
pulsive for the neutral forms.

¿From the DFT calculated vertical ionisation poten-
tials and electron aﬃnities, and the binding energy of
the ion pair, the energy of the zwitterion can be es-
timated relative to the neutrals. The binding energy
was calculated using the same intermolecular potential,
with ﬁxed partial charges corresponding to each partic-
ular ion. This scheme neglects the resonance interaction
PAH+PAH− ⇀↽PAH−PAH+. We ﬁnd the relative zwit-
terion energies ∆E = 4.23, 3.38, and 2.87 eV above the
the neutral minimum for the pyrene, coronene, and OBC
dimers, respectively. These values are similar to the re-
sult reported by Piuzzi et al.
for anthracene trimers of

around 3.5 eV.48

Finally, the distance between molecular planes was
found to lie between 3.56 ˚A for (pyrene)2 and 3.50 ˚A for
(circumcoronene)2. These values compare well with the
data reported by Marzec,54 as well as the experimental
value for crystal packings obtained by Goddard et al. on
HBC.57

B. Coronene clusters

The lowest-energy structures of coronene aggregates
are found to be single stacks as long as the number of
molecules does not exceed eight. In these stacks, the ori-
entations alternate so that adjacent molecules are stag-
gered. Single stacks remain local minima for larger num-
bers of molecules, mainly due to the short-range charac-
ter of the interaction. However, above eight molecules
lower energy structures appear, as illustrated in Fig. 3
for (coronene)10.

6

In comparison, the 6+5+5 triple stack built by adding
a third column to the structure of Fig. 3c in a triangu-
lar fashion is slightly higher in energy. This diﬀerence is
mainly due to the geometrical frustration arising when
trying to alternate the new molecular planes with those
already present.

We attempted to grow the S-shaped structure fur-
ther by adding molecules at the six extremities, but this
proved not to be the optimal route for larger clusters.
There are many ways to put together 4-stacks in order
to generate a (PAH)32 cluster. The four most stable such
conformations are sketched in Fig. 4.

The most stable conformation is shown in Fig. 3a. In
this global minimum the two ‘C’-shaped stacks adopt a
conﬁguration that looks rather like a handshake. The
tilted stacks of Fig. 3c, which we expected to be natural
evolution of the one-dimensional stack, turn out to be
less favorable at this size. The special stability of the
‘handshake’ structure is due to its compactness, while
conserving the primary stack motifs as basic units. Not
surprisingly, other combinations of stacks such as 4+6
or 3+7 are higher in energy than the 5+5 structure of
Fig. 3a.

Among these conformations, three schemes based on
alternating stacks oriented perpendicularly are very close
in energy, independent of the stack sizes. However, four
8-stack, tilted columns with parallel axes provide the
most stable conformation at this size. This structure,
depicted in Fig. 4a, appears as a clear precursor to the
herringbone crystal packing reported by Khanna et al.87
from computer experiments. Even though we did not
carry out a systematic search for minima above 20 PAH
molecules, decreasing the stack size from the (coronene)32
herringbone motif of Fig. 4a remained the most stable
structure down to less than 24 molecules. Below this
size, perpendicular stacks similar to Fig. 4c become the
global minimum. The fully intertwinned structure ex-
empliﬁed in Fig. 4d is only optimal at sizes lower than
20. Therefore, it seems that bulk structure appears in
coronene at about N ∼ 24 molecules.

The appearance of bulk features in the structural prop-
erties of clusters has attracted much attention in the past,
especially in molecular clusters.88,89,90 It was noticed in

particular that more isotropic species such as argon or
nitrogen exhibit the bulk crystalline character at much
larger sizes than anisotropic molecules like CO2.89 The
results for coronene thus seem to conﬁrm this observa-
tion.

C. Stability

The previous results obtained for coronene clusters
generally hold for other PAH molecular units. The rel-
ative stability of single- or multiple-stack structures is
shown in Fig. 5. Pyrene clusters form single stacks, then
‘handshake’ stacks above seven molecules.
In circum-
coronene clusters, the one-dimensional stack remains the
global minimum until 17 molecules are reached. The sin-
gle stacks remain stable longer for larger PAH’s, prob-
ably because this motif is favorable until the length ex-
ceeds the diameter of the molecule itself. From N = 18
and above, circumcoronene clusters favor the herringbone
conformation pictured in Fig. 3c for coronene. This re-
sult again conﬁrms the idea that increasingly anisotropic
molecules show earlier signatures of bulk structure.

FIG. 5: Binding energy of single- and multiple-stack struc-
tures of pyrene, coronene, and circumcoronene assemblies.

The relative stability of stacked conﬁgurations is also
addressed in Fig. 6 where we compare the dissociation
energy of double stack structures (herringbone or ‘hand-
shake’ conformations) into their two stacks with that of
the most weakly bound molecule. The latter molecule
is located at one of the four extremities of the stacks.
Again, we consider pyrene, coronene and circumcoronene
clusters. Obviously, the dissociation energy of a double
stack into two stacks grows approximately linearly with
stack size. Conversely, the binding energy of one single
molecule remains nearly constant, and depends mainly
on the monomer. These trends, evident in Fig. 6, ex-
plain why it becomes more interesting to remove a sin-
gle molecule only after some crossover size, below which
the extra stability of the small stacks dominates. The
crossover sizes, seven for pyrene, nine for coronene and

moval of one molecule versus dissociation between the two
stacks.

17 for circumcoronene, correlate with the change in sta-
bility of double stacks with respect to single stacks. This
result emphasizes that, unlike most weakly bound clus-
ters, monomer dissociation may not always be the lowest
energy dissociation pathway for such species.

D. Demixing in heterogeneous clusters

To date, no speciﬁc PAH has been clearly identiﬁed
as the carrier of the interstellar AIB’s.
In fact, these
bands probably result from the emission of a popula-
tion of several types of PAH molecules,91,92 and we ex-
pect interstellar PAH assemblies to be quite heteroge-
neous. It is therefore important to characterize the ef-
fects of mixing on the most stable conformations. Ta-
ble III shows the relative stability of the various pos-
sible stacks containing two pairs of identical molecules
based on sixfold symmetry. As in homogeneous clus-
ters, we were not able to locate structures more stable
than these perfect stacks. Stack (a), in which the larger
PAH’s occupy interior sites, maximizes the number of
nearest neighbors between carbon atoms and is ener-
getically the most favorable. Similar arguments explain
the ordering of isomers (a–d). As expected, the relative
stability increases with the disparity between the PAH
molecules: the energy of stack (b) is smaller than those of
stack (a) by about 10% for (coronene+circumcoronene)2,
but only 8.7% for (coronene+HBC)2 and 3.4% for
(HBC+circumcoronene)2.

This segregation property also appears for larger clus-
ters. As an example we have investigated the hetero-
geneous assemblies containing 6 large and 4 small PAH
molecules of the coronene, HBC, and circumcoronene
types. The putative global minima we found are all based
on the same structures obtained for the homogeneous
coronene cluster depicted in Fig. 3. For each of these
isomers, the optimal locations of the smaller PAH are at

agreement with the energetic arguments used to explain
the trends in Table III.

In Table IV we compare the relative energies of these
three conformations for the three mixtures. Substituting
the six innermost molecules of the single stack (b) always
yields the optimal structure. This result reﬂects the extra
stability of single stacks of large molecules, as seen pre-
viously. Hence the geometry is essentially determined by
the larger PAH molecule. This observation cannot easily
be generalized to arbitrary numbers or small and large
molecules, and it would be interesting to look further
into the eﬀects of changing composition on the relative
stability of heterogeneous assemblies.

INTERMOLECULAR VIBRATIONS

Our eventual interest lies in interpreting experimental
infrared spectra by identifying the possible PAH assem-
blies responsible. Although the present paper is mainly
devoted to the prediction of structure, we wish to address
here the intermolecular vibrations of the smallest clusters
(dimers), leaving a more general discussion about larger
assemblies and the couplings with intramolecular motion
to future work.

The normal mode frequencies were obtained by double
numerical diﬀerentiation of the potential energy and ap-
propriate mass weighting. The main vibrational modes
are characterized in Table V for all dimers of the same
PAH ranging from pyrene to circumcoronene, as well as
the zwitterionic form of (coronene)2 for comparison. As
expected from the strong anisotropy of the molecular in-
teractions, the vibrational modes can generally be gath-

ered into two separate groups, the bending and breathing
motions being the stiﬀest and the shearing and twisting
motions the softest. The frequency of the breathing mode
grows quite regularly with increasing PAH mass. For the
circumcoronene dimer, this frequency is quite close to
the value generally accepted for graphene layers, namely
f0 = 63.7 cm−1. This result indicates that our atomistic
modelling is physically correct.

The increase of the frequencies for larger PAH’s is a
natural consequence of the increasing strength of the
repulsion-dispersion interactions. Both the repulsive and
attractive parts of the potential increase roughly linearly
with the surface area of the PAH molecules, because they
are both short-ranged. At ﬁrst order, the force constant
scales approximately linearly with the PAH mass, there-
fore the associated frequency remains constant. How-
ever, the attractive part of the potential has a shorter
range than its repulsive part, so it increases somewhat
faster with the mass. Thus the eﬀective force constant
increases slightly more rapidly than linearly with the
mass, in agreement with the observed increase in the fre-
quency. This eﬀect is magniﬁed by the decreasing role of
the Coulomb forces, which become negligible in the limit
of two graphene sheets.

The bending modes generally show similar frequencies
to the breathing mode, and also the same pattern. How-
ever, less symmetrical molecules, such as ovalene or OBC,
have non-degenerate bending modes, resulting in smaller
average values. Both the twisting and shearing modes are
comparatively very soft, reﬂecting the small corrugation
of the molecular planes.

Lastly, the vibrations of the zwitterionic form of the
coronene dimer, chosen as a typical example, display sig-
niﬁcantly stiﬀer modes. In this system, the Coulomb in-
teractions become dominant at long range, which aﬀects
the shearing, and especially the twisting modes.

Larger assemblies of PAH molecules show a greater va-
riety of modes. Stack vibrations have been considered by
Seahra and Duley53 in the one-dimensional approxima-
tion of longitudinal modes only. However, the results ob-

tained in the previous section show that multiple-stack
conformations should become more stable as more and
more PAH molecules are added. This result calls for a
more complete study of vibrational properties, including
the possible inﬂuence of intramolecular motion.

V. DISCUSSION

A. Diﬃculties with optimization

In the original basin-hopping global minimization ap-
proach followed here, all molecules are translated and
rotated simultaneously from their original position be-
fore a new local optimization is carried out. Subsequent
moves are then performed starting from the current lo-
cal minimum in a Markov chain. This approach was not
very eﬃcient for large PAH assemblies and/or extended
individual molecules due to the frequent intersections in-
duced by the large amplitude motions. The parallel tem-
pering strategy, which employs smaller physical moves,
avoids such problems but can be quite slow in converg-
ing toward low energies. In addition the set of tempera-
tures needs to be adjusted for the conﬁgurations to be
communicated to the colder trajectories.
In practice,
we supplemented the parallel tempering MC simulations
with periodic quenches at the trajectory corresponding
to T = 20 K. Several of the most stable structures were
found by seeding the optimizations with a single main
stack and adding the required extra molecules randomly
in space.

The results obtained in the previous section and the
occurrence of small stacks as the main structural motif of
larger assemblies suggest several ways for improving the
basin-hopping technique in order to deal more eﬃciently
with such anisotropic molecules as PAH’s:

(i) Randomly select a single molecule; choose its ori-
entation from among those of the other molecules;
move the molecule randomly in space to a location
where it does not suﬀer any overlap.

(ii) Select several molecules stacked together and move
then simultaneously as a block, so that they do not
overlap with any remaining molecule.

(iii) Follow collective, large amplitude motion with a
rescaling of all distances, such that the minimum
pair distance is at least the PAH size; then choose
random orientations for all molecules.

(iv) Perform local moves that add or remove a single

molecule at the tip of a stack.

The above ideas can be combined into a single Monte
Carlo approach, with appropriate probabilities for each
type of move. They are suited to the speciﬁc case of pro-
late molecules, which pose more signiﬁcant diﬃculties in
numerical simulations than spherical or oblate species.
Such moves obviously constitute a bias to optimization,

but they should improve the performance of the algo-
rithm by guiding it toward the multiple-stack funnels.

B.

Inﬂuence of the potential

The choice of the intermolecular potential is crucial in
predicting the correct physical and chemical properties
of macromolecular assemblies. This is especially true for
smaller molecules, such as benzene, where small changes
in the repulsion-dispersion or electrostatic parameters
can easily lead to the wrong crystal structure.93

We did not ﬁnd signiﬁcant changes in our results on
taking the Lennard-Jones parameters from other sources,
such as the OPLS model of Jorgensen and coworkers.45
However, the same is not true for the electrostatic mul-
tipolar contribution. The NBO charges obtained from
the same DFT calculation on the coronene molecule are
signiﬁcantly larger in magnitude than the EPF charges,
especially on the hydrogens (Table II). The correspond-
ing Coulomb energy is therefore much larger, and be-
comes comparable to the dispersion energy. Such charges
yield very diﬀerent global minima, as illustrated in Fig. 7
for (coronene)13. The disappearance of the handshake
structure, Fig. 7a, reﬂects the much longer range char-
acter of the intermolecular interaction, which somewhat
shields the molecular anisotropy. Here it becomes nec-
essary to clearly distinguish between the anisotropy of
the molecules themselves (the so-called shape anisotropy)
and the eﬀective anisotropy of their intermolecular poten-
tial. Increasing the magnitude of the Coulomb interac-
tion results in a stronger short-range repulsion, which is
ﬁrst manifested in destabilization of the simple stack, ei-
ther crossed or parallel-displaced, for the coronene dimer.
At their new equilibrium distance, the relative orienta-
tion between two molecules is mainly driven by the inter-
action between quadrupoles. For larger PAH molecules,
we expect the partial charges and quadrupole to become
less and less important as the carbon frame gets more
homogeneous. On the contrary, smaller PAH’s should be
even more sensitive to the electrostatic eﬀects. This is
consistent with the equilibrium structures, which favour
the T-shaped motif over parallel stacks.

In larger assemblies,

isotropic interactions favor an
icosahedral growth scheme over stacking. In the struc-
ture displayed in Fig. 7b, the molecular centers of mass
indeed form a distorted icosahedron, similar to what has
been found in (benzene)13 by several authors.29,36,38,39
Such structures are signiﬁcantly easier to locate than
stacked isomers, because the orientational degrees of free-
dom can be neglected in a ﬁrst approach. Here the third
trick suggested in the previous subsection for improving
the basin-hopping algorithm should be eﬃcient.

The Mulliken charges responsible for the icosahedral
minimum are probably much too high and they do not
support stable stacks of coronene PAH’s, which is in dis-
agreement with most previous studies. Conversely, set-
ting the partial charges to zero does not alter the results

very much, thus conﬁrming that stacking is mostly in-
duced by the intrinsic molecular anisotropy.

VI. CONCLUSION

The work reported in this paper was devoted to locat-
ing the global minimum for assemblies of large polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbon molecules. To do this we ﬁrst con-
structed an empirical potential from available data for
the repulsion-dispersion part, as well as from some care-
fully analysed density functional calculations for the elec-
trostatic contribution. These extra ab initio calculations
were mainly motivated by the lack of published data on
the speciﬁc interactions between large PAH molecules. In
an attempt to rationalize the various charge distributions
obtained for the neutral and ionic PAH’s, we adjusted a
simple ﬂuctuating charges model based on four param-
eters. This model, used for reoptimizing the charges of

10

the PAH molecules in the environment of their own sta-
ble assemblies, indicates that the ﬁxed partial charges
approximation is quantitatively correct, at least close to
the equilibrium geometries.

Using a combined set of global optimization tech-
niques, we have shown that clusters of PAH molecules
grow by forming stacks. This optimization process
turned out to be diﬃcult because of the large amplitude
random motions involved. Therefore the putative global
minima we have found might be bettered in future work,
although we expect the trends to be correct. We sug-
gested ways of improving optimization algorithms dealing
with strong shape anisotropy, which could also be useful
for the liquid crystal phases of discotic molecules.60,61,62
Stack formation appears to be mainly driven by the
PAH size, since clusters of benzene and, to some ex-
tent, naphthalene or anthracene, tend to keep some of the
polytetrahedral order known in small atomic clusters.29
However, the one-dimensional growth of the stack is quite
limited, and more close-packed forms become favored af-
ter a certain size, which increases with the PAH diameter.
These new forms are based on smaller stacks, and larger
clusters are also made of the small stack motif. Even-
tually, parallel stacks with alternate orientations of the
molecular plane appear, as the precursor to the herring-
bone crystalline arrangement. We also found that the
electronic structure calculations of the partial charges
had to be performed carefully, since overestimation of
the Coulomb energy wrongly leads to more isotropic in-
teractions, which destabilizes the stacks.

The formation and physico-chemical evolution of
PAH’s is a question of great interest in astrochemistry.
Recently, Rapacioli et al.28 have revealed the chemical
link that exists between PAH molecules and small car-
bonaceous grains. These authors suggested that the
grains might be PAH clusters. The results presented here
can provide guidelines to understand the nature and evo-
lution of such systems in astrophysical environments. We
note that all these results are only based upon energetic
considerations and that entropic criteria have not been
taken into account. Growth could proceed by monomer
addition, but also by the addition of small clusters, pre-
sumably as short stacks. Therefore, the aggregation ki-
netics could also play an important role in the structure
of the ﬁnal aggregate. As we have seen, thermodynam-
ics should favor segregation, since smaller PAH’s are ex-
pected to be located in the outermost parts of the aggre-
gate. Upon addition of one or more extra PAH’s, the re-
arrangements required to reach the true global minimum
involve very high energy barriers, due to the anisotropy
of the molecules and their layered structures. In the in-
terior of molecular clouds the temperature is very low,
which might be an argument against the relevance of
calculations based on thermodynamics only. However,
the large timescales involved in molecular clouds, whose
lifetime is close to ∼106 years, could allow the cluster
to explore many conﬁgurations, eventually reaching low-
lying minima. Another opportunity for rearrangement

11

into these stable conﬁgurations comes from heating by
UV-visible photons originating from stars at the border
It is in such regions that Rapacioli et
of the clouds.
al.28 have reported photophysical data for PAH clusters,
through their mid-IR emission spectrum and photoevap-
oration properties. In these heated regions, we predict
that for mixed clusters the smallest PAH’s are located at
the periphery and are therefore photoevaporated ﬁrst. If
this is the case, the composition of both aggregated and
free interstellar PAH’s is expected to strongly depend on
UV processing.

In this paper we also brieﬂy discussed the intermolec-
ular vibrational modes. Although our results are very
preliminary, they already give an idea of the frequen-
cies expected for such modes. For the stiﬀest modes,
values between 55.6 and 81.3 cm−1 are found. They
could correspond to bands in the astronomical spectra
and can be searched for in the data obtained from the

Long Wavelength Spectrometer, which was on board the
Infrared Space Observatory.94 One diﬃculty is to disen-
tangle these bands from the numerous intense molecular
lines at moderate resolution.95 Hopefully, the PAH clus-
ter features will be revealed by future space missions in
the far-IR to submillimeter range, in particular, the Her-
schel Space Observatory will explore the 16–175 cm−1
range.

In addition to the intermolecular modes obtained from
the present model, the inﬂuence of the cluster structure
on the intramolecular frequencies needs to be quantiﬁed,
and compared to available astronomical spectra.28 In-
vestigating the coupling between inter- and intramolecu-
lar modes requires a more realistic atomistic description,
beyond the rigid-body approximation. Extensions of
the tight-binding Hamiltonian developed by the Parneix
group96 are currently under development.

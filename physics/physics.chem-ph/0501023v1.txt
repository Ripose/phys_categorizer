Accurate interaction energies from perturbation theory based on Kohn-Sham model

(Dated: February 2, 2008)

The density-functional based symmetry-adapted perturbation theory [SAPT(DFT)] has been ap-
plied to the argon, krypton, and benzene dimers. It is shown that—at a small fraction of computa-
tional costs—SAPT(DFT) can provide similar accuracies for the interaction energies as high-level
wave-function based methods with extrapolations to the complete basis set limits. This accuracy is
signiﬁcantly higher than that of any other DFT or DFT-based approaches proposed to date.

The intermolecular forces—sometimes called van der
Waals (vdW) interactions or forces—determine the struc-
ture and properties of most clusters, liquids, and solids.
These forces also govern many life processes, such as the
genetic code replication, protein structure and dynamics,
and enzymatic actions. Thus, the ability to computation-
ally predict van der Waals forces is signiﬁcant for the un-
derstanding of all these systems. However, although the
standard wave-function based electronic structure meth-
ods can in principle be used for such predictions, in prac-
tice these methods are too time consuming to be ap-
plied to most systems of interest in biology, even with
extensive use of the current computers capabilities. The
density-functional theory (DFT) methods are much less
time-consuming, however, the currently existing versions
of DFT fail to describe the dispersion interaction, an im-
portant part of the van der Waals force. This problem is
due to the fact that the dispersion forces result from long-
range correlations between electrons, whereas the current
exchange-correlation potentials model only short-range
correlation eﬀects. Many authors add the asymptotic ex-
pansion of the dispersion energy to the DFT interaction
energies, which inherently includes some double counting
(see Ref. 1 for a discussion of these issues).

Occasionally, for a speciﬁc system, one of the variants
of DFT can give reasonably good predictions of inter-
action energies, at least in some regions of a potential
energy surface. This fact encouraged some authors to
build system-speciﬁc potentials ﬁtted to a number of grid
points on the potential energy surface computed using
a wave-function based method. For example, Boese et
al. [2] optimized an ammonia-speciﬁc potential by ad-
justing some parameters in one of the standard function-
als. Recently, Lilienfeld et al. [3] proposed to use atom-
centered nonlocal eﬀective core potentials with parame-
ters adjusted for speciﬁc systems. These methods do not
oﬀer physically motivated improvement of the density-
functional formalism but rather rely on cancellations of
errors. Also, a number of wave-function calculations are
needed to optimize the parameters in the functionals,
which limits the range of applications to systems that
can be treated with the latter methods (unless the pa-
rameters can be shown to be transferable).

An approach which uses the speciﬁc characteristic of
the dispersion interaction has recently been presented by
Dion et al. [4]. The method was denoted by the authors
as vdW-DF. It adds a nonlocal correlation energy part
to existing functionals. This term models the dispersion
energy utilizing approximate density response functions.
The method predicts interaction energies of the systems
investigated in Ref. 4 qualitatively (to within a factor of
about 1.5, see below).

Another approach to the calculations of interaction
energies for large molecules was developed by Mis-
quitta et al. [5, 6] and independently by Hesselmann
and Jansen [7], following ideas of Williams and Cha-
balowski
[8]. This approach is based on symmetry-
adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) [9], but utilizes
the description of the interacting monomers in terms
of Kohn-Sham (KS) orbitals, orbital energies, and
frequency-dependent density susceptibility (FDDS) func-
tions. The DFT-based SAPT will be called SAPT(DFT).
This method can be shown to be potentially exact for all
major components of the interaction energy (asymptot-
ically for exchange interactions) in the sense that these
components would be exact if the DFT description of the
monomers were exact [5, 6, 10]. Applications to a number
of small dimers have shown that SAPT(DFT) provides
surprisingly accurate results, sometimes more accurate
than the standard SAPT at the currently programmed
level [10, 11].

The regular SAPT method involves expansions in pow-
ers of the intermonomer interaction operator V and
the intramonomer correlation operator W , the so-called
Møller-Plesset (MP) potential. The terms proportional
to powers of W describe the eﬀects of intramonomer
electron correlation on the interaction energy.
Simi-
larly as in the electronic-structure many-body pertur-
bation theory (MBPT) or coupled-cluster (CC) meth-
ods, these terms are expensive to compute, with CPU
times scaling as a high power of system size N —the sev-
enth power if the complete currently programmed set
of SAPT components is included. This scaling is the
same as for MBPT in the fourth order (MP4) or CC
including single, double, and noniterated triple excita-
tions [CCSD(T)]. In SAPT(DFT), no terms of this type

appear, as the intramonomer correlation eﬀects are ac-
counted for by DFT. Therefore, SAPT(DFT) scales as
only N 5, i.e., a SAPT(DFT) calculation is generally or-
ders of magnitude faster than a regular SAPT calculation
at the complete currently programmed level. This com-
putational advantage is further signiﬁcantly increased by
the superior basis set convergence of SAPT(DFT) com-
pared to the wave-function based electron correlation
methods. The latter methods converge slowly due to
the necessity of reproducing the intramonomer electron-
electron cusps by expansions in products of one-electron
functions. Such expansions do not appear in DFT. In
SAPT(DFT), the orbital-product expansions are present
in the expressions for the dispersion energy, however, it
has been shown [10, 11] that this component (similarly
as the SAPT dispersion energy of zeroth order in W )
can be saturated in reasonably small basis sets provided
that “midbond” functions are used, i.e., basis functions
are placed at a point between the two monomers.
It
appears that, in many cases, polarized triple-zeta (TZ)
quality bases give SAPT(DFT) interaction energy com-
ponents converged to a similar number of digits as the
regular SAPT components in polarized quadruple-zeta
(QZ) bases. This results in a diﬀerence in the basis set
size of about a factor of two, a ratio of 24 in computer
time at the MP4 or CCSD(T) level. Our current imple-
mentation of SAPT(DFT) is using an interface to the
time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) part CADPAC [12] to
compute FDDS’s, which is the time-limiting step of the
calculations. An optimized TD-DFT program now un-
der development should decrease time requirements of
this step by at least one order of magnitude. This will
make the largest calculations described here comparable
to the supermolecular DFT calculations in the same ba-
sis. Thus, the SAPT(DFT) method is not prohibitively
expensive, as stated by the authors of Ref. 3, and it
has already been applied to systems containing about
40 atoms and 200 electrons [13].

We present here the ﬁrst application of SAPT(DFT)

to relatively large interacting monomers.
compare with the vdW-DF method, we have chosen the
same systems as investigated in Ref. 4: Ar2, Kr2, and
the benzene dimer. We have used the following Carte-
sian basis sets: aug-cc-pV5Z [14] for Ar2 (with g and
h functions removed due to restrictions of CADPAC),
aug-cc-pVTZ [14] for Kr2, and a polarized double-zeta
size basis with polarization coeﬃcients optimized on dis-
persion energy [15] for benzene.
In all cases, we used
a set of midbond functions consisting of s and p func-
tions with exponents 0.9, 0.3, 0.1, and d and f functions
with exponents 0.6 and 0.2, placed at the center of mass
of each dimer. We used the monomer-centered “plus”
form of basis sets [16] for the argon (including d functions
on the interacting partner) and benzene dimers, and the
full dimer-centered form Kr2. For the benzene dimer, we
considered the parallel “sandwich” conﬁguration, and the

monomer geometry was taken from Ref. 17. We employed
PBE0 [18] DFT functional with the asymptotic correc-
tion [5] for all the systems. In addition, the B97-2 [19]
functional was applied at near minimum geometries for
all dimers and at all points for the argon dimer. Eﬀects
of the third and higher orders in V have been neglected.
In TD-DFT, we have used the standard PBE0 or B97-2
kernels for argon and krypton, and the LDA kernel for
benzene. The use of the LDA kernel provides a consid-
erable speedup of calculations. To check the accuracy of
this approximation, we performed a single-point calcula-
tion using the PBE0 kernel for the benzene dimer. The
error in the dispersion energy was smaller than 1%.

Figure 1 presents the interaction potential for the ar-
gon dimer. The benchmark results are the empirical
potential of Aziz [21] and the CCSD(T) potential with
extrapolation to the complete basis set (CBS) limit by
Patkowski et al. [20]. The two curves are almost indis-
tinguishable, showing the very high level of agreement
between ab initio theory and experiment for this sys-
tem. The SAPT(DFT) calculations are very close to the
benchmarks, within about 2 cm−1 or 2% at the mini-
mum geometry. In contrast, the vdW-DF method gives
a curve which is about 1.6 times too deep, and the min-
imum position is shifted by 0.2 ˚A.

Our results for the krypton dimer are displayed in
Fig. 2. For this system, the benchmark curve is given by
the empirical ﬁt of Dham et al. [22]. The CCSD(T) curve
computed by Slav´ıˇcek et al. [23] represents the best litera-
ture non-relativistic theoretical result and is in fact at the
limit of what the ab initio methods are capable of achiev-
ing at the present time. The SAPT(DFT) curve agrees
with the benchmark slightly better than the CCSD(T)
one, and much better than the curve produced by the
vdW-DF method [4]. The latter curve is about a factor

Finally, the benzene dimer results are presented in

mark available. The best ab initio calculations for a

we will quote the MP2 and ∆CCSD(T) values in paren-
theses. Model II gives −1.62 (−2.85, 1.24) kcal/mol at
3.8 ˚A. The authors computed also an extrapolated inter-
action energy (“Model III”, only at 3.8 ˚A) by perform-
ing a CBS extrapolation at the MP2 level and scaling
the ∆CCSD(T) component, which gave −1.48 (−3.28,
1.80) kcal/mol. Accurate calculations for the benzene
dimer were also performed by Sinnokrot et al. [24], but
only at a single point, R = 3.7 ˚A. These authors com-
puted the MP2 energies in bases up to aug-cc-pVQZ and
∆CCSD(T) in aug-cc-pVDZ, which gives −1.54 (−3.37,
1.83) kcal/mol. If one extrapolates the MP2 TZ-QZ re-
sults of Ref. 24 using the X −3 extrapolation scheme, one
obtains the value of −3.45 kcal/mol, not much diﬀerent
from the best calculated result. Sinnokrot et al. com-
puted the MP2 energy using also the so-called MP2-R12
explicitly correlated basis and their recommended inter-
action energy is −1.81 (−3.64, 1.83) kcal/mol. The fairly
large discrepancy between the extrapolated and MP2-
R12 results could be due to an insuﬃcient convergence
of the resolution of identity applied in the MP2-R12 ap-
proach in the [spdf /spd] bases. Based on these consid-
erations, one has to assume that the uncertainty of the
CCSD(T) curve in Fig. 3 is about ±0.2 kcal/mol.

Figure 3 shows that the agreement of SAPT(DFT)
with the CCSD(T) results is very good, in particular tak-
ing into account the uncertainty of the latter. In fact, in
view of this uncertainty, the SAPT(DFT) results provide
an independent set of the best current estimates of the
exact interaction energies for the benzene dimer. The
vdW-DF curve is deeper by about a factor of 1.4 and the
minimum is shifted by about 0.2 ˚A. Figure 3 includes also
the MP2 results from Ref. 17, the DFT results of Lilien-
feld et al. from Ref. 3, and the MP2 results of Sinnokrot
et al. [24] which were used to calibrate the Lilienfeld et
al. DFT functional. The diﬀerences between the two
MP2 curves are consistent with the sizes of the basis set
eﬀects discussed above. For the benzene dimer, the MP2
level of theory is not adequate and therefore the results of
Lilienfeld et al. [3] are very far from the CCSD(T) bench-
mark. If these authors had chosen to ﬁt their functional

to the CCSD(T) level of theory, the calculations would
have become signiﬁcantly more expensive. This empha-
sizes the fact that the DFT results of Ref. 3 can only be
as accurate as the underlying wave-function based calcu-
lations. Even within the MP2 model, Fig. 3 shows that
the agreement between the DFT and MP2 energies dete-
riorates quickly in the regions farther from the minimum.
It should be emphasized that, in contrast to the su-
permolecular DFT approach, SAPT(DFT) is relatively
insensitive to the choice of the DFT functional. Sev-
eral published papers show that the results given by the
former method with diﬀerent choices of the functionals
can diﬀer by an order of magnitude and can be of the
wrong sign (see, e.g., Refs. 1, 25). The results displayed
in Fig. 1 and in Table I show that the SAPT(DFT) re-
sults computed with PBE0 and B97-2, two functionals
developed using very diﬀerent principles, agree very well,
with discrepancies being of the same magnitude as other
uncertainties of the SAPT(DFT) approach.

An advantage of the SAPT approach is that it gives di-
rectly the physical components of the interaction energy.
In Table II, we present such components for the benzene
dimer and compare with SAPT calculations by Sinnokrot
and Sherrill [26]. We have omitted in this comparison
terms beyond the second order in V computed in Ref 26.
These terms amount to −0.14 kcal/mol. Generally, the
agreement between SAPT(DFT) and SAPT is good tak-
ing into account diﬀerent levels of intramonomer corre-
lation eﬀects, diﬀerent basis sets, and diﬀerent monomer
geometries used.

In summary, we have shown that SAPT(DFT) is capa-
ble to achieve the accuracy of intermolecular interaction
energies similar to that of the CCSD(T)/CBS approach
at a very small fraction of computational costs. This ac-
curacy is much higher than that of the vdW-DF method
of Dion et al. [4]. The SAPT(DFT) method is rigor-
ously valid for all separations between the interacting
molecules. It therefore constitutes the most accurate cur-
rent approach for practical calculations of interactions for
large monomers, containing as many as 20 atoms each.
This development will bring some important biophysi-

cal applications within reach of computational physics
(e.g., interactions involving DNA bases, small polypep-
tides, and sugars).

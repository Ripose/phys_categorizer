We present results of theoretical description and numerical calculation of the dynamics of molec-
ular liquids based on the Reference Interaction Site Model / Mode-Coupling Theory. They
include the temperature-pressure(density) dependence of the translational diﬀusion coeﬃcients
and orientational relaxation times for acetonitrile and methanol in water at inﬁnite dilution.
Anomalous behavior, i.e. the increase in mobility with density, is observed for the orientational
relaxation time of methanol, while acetonitrile does not show any deviations from the usual.
This eﬀect is in qualitative agreement with the recent data of MD simulation and with experi-
mental measurements, which tells us that presented theory is a good candidate to explain such
kind of anomalies from the microscopical point of view and with the connection to the structure
of the molecules.

Theoretical studies of liquid dynamics and relaxation have been dominated during the
past century by the two continuum models which had been established essentially in the
18th century: the electrodynamics and the hydrodynamics [1]. The monumental achieve-
ments made in the ﬁeld of liquid dynamics by the great scientists such as A. Einstein [2],
P. Debye [3], L. Onsager [4, 5] and M. Born [6] are essentially based on the continuum
theories: the dielectric relaxation, the ion mobility and its concentration dependence,
and so on. Such theories represented by the Stokes-Einstein-Debye (SED) law rely on the
boundary conditions as well as phenomenological use of macroscopic constants such as the
viscosity and dielectric constants in order to realize “chemistry” speciﬁc of the problem
in concern. Typical examples of the boundary conditions are the “slip” and “stick” ones
often employed in equations based on the hydrodynamic theory.

Dynamics in solutions has been a central issue in the physical chemistry.
It has been
so because liquid dynamics is an important factor which determines the rate of chemical
processes in solution including chemical reactions and protein folding. A variety of ex-
perimental methods have been devised to observe liquid dynamics, which now cover the
dynamic range from femtoseconds to days.

Introduction

1

The continuum models have played crucial roles in describing physics taking place in
solution with the spatial as well as temporal resolutions which are low enough so that
molecular details of the process can be neglected. There have been gaps between the
phenomenological model and molecular processes. The gaps have been ﬁlled by using
such adjectives as “eﬀective”. For example, the conductivity of a simple ion in aqueous
solutions at inﬁnite dilution depends on their size in entirely opposite manner to what is
predicted from the Stokes law, if one employs the crystal radii as the ion size. In order to
ﬁll the gap between the phenomenological model and the molecular process, people have
invented an “eﬀective” radius or the Stokes radius, and interpreted the phenomenon in
terms of the enhanced Stokes radii due to “hydration”. So called “fractional exponent”,
e.g. [7], often used in the interpretation of the viscosity dependence of a relaxation rate
in liquids is another example which tries to compromise the contradiction between phe-
nomenological models and experiments. If an experimentalist tries to plot a relaxation
rate against viscosity, he will often face serious violation of a law predicted by a phe-
nomenological theory. It has been a common maneuver in such cases to use “fractional”
dependence on viscosity. However, the use of “fractional” dependence does not add any
information to describe molecular process actually taking place in solutions, but just hides
the breakdown of the phenomenological theory. Recent experimental techniques, which
are dramatically improved both in resolution and sensitivity, have demonstrated unam-
biguously breakdown of the phenomenological model. Let us refer to two contributions
which exhibit such breakdown. Nakahara [8] and co-workers have shown that the rota-
tional dynamics of a solute in a variety of solvents does not correlate with the viscosity
of the solvent but rather with speciﬁc interactions between solute and solvent. Terazima
and his coworkers [9] have found that the diﬀusion constant of radical species is roughly a
half of that of their parent molecules, which are about the same size. We suppose no more
words are necessary to convince people what may happen if one tries to describe more
complicated dynamics in solution, e.g., conformational change of protein and chemical
reactions, in terms of the phenomenological models.

Are there, then, any hope for theories of solution dynamics to break through the old
regime established by the great scientists? We say “yes”, if one relies on the two theories in
the statistical mechanics developed in the last century: the generalized Langevin equation
(GLE) [10] and the RISM theory of molecular liquids [11–13]. The generalized Langevin
theory describes the time evolution of few dynamic variables in concern as a function
of the representative point in the phase space. All other variables which are not under
explicit concern are projected onto the dynamic variables of interest with the help of
a projection operator. The projection leads to an equation which looks similar to the
phenomenological Langevin equation containing the frictional force proportional to the
rate of change of the dynamic variables, and the random force, which are related to each
other by a ﬂuctuation-dissipation theorem. If one chooses as the dynamic variables the
density and the conjugated ﬂux of sites or atoms of molecules in liquids, the theory gives
an equation for the dynamic structure factor of atoms, which describes the time evolution
of the site-site density pair correlation functions [14]. Results from the RISM theory, the
site-site static structure factor and the direct correlation functions, are naturally plugged
into GLE in order to evaluate not only the initial condition of the dynamics or the static
structure factor, but also the frictional force as well as the collective frequency which

2

concerns the frequency of the site-site density ﬂuctuation. A crucial development of the
theory is rather conceptual, not mathematical, in the sense that it has provided a new
concept to view dynamics of a molecule in solution, which is quite diﬀerent from the model
traditionally exploited in the ﬁeld. The new model sees the molecular motion in liquid as a
correlated translational motion of atoms: if two atoms in a diatomic molecule are moving
in the same direction, then the molecule as a whole is making a translational motion,
while the molecule should be rotating if its atoms are moving in opposite directions. The
view is diﬀerent from the rotational-translational model traditionally developed based on
the angular coordinates [15–17].

The new theory of liquid dynamics has been successfully applied to a variety of relax-
ation process in solution including the collective excitations in water [18], ion dynamics in
dipolar liquids [19], dynamical Stokes shift [20, 21], pressure dependence of the transport
coeﬃcients [22] as well as dielectric relaxation spectrum in water [23], and so forth. In
the present proceeding, we report our latest study on dynamics of a molecule in solution
at inﬁnite dilution and its temperature and density dependence.

Theory

Equilibrium structure

In this work, we use the dielectrically-consistent reference interaction-site model (or
DRISM for brevity) formalism [24] for the system. The main equation here is the site-site
Ornstein-Zernike equation (SSOZ) written as
ρ˜h(k)ρ
˜χ(k) = [ ˜ω(k) + ˜χ(k)]˜c(k)[ ˜ω(k) + ˜χ(k)] + [ ˜ω(k) + ˜χ(k)]˜c(k)[ρ˜h(k)ρ
˜χ(k)], (1)
where ρ is the diagonal matrix of number density of molecular species, and ˜h(k), ˜c(k)
and ˜ω(k) are the total, direct and intramolecular correlation matrices, respectively, in
the reciprocal space. The matrix ˜χ(k) is determined by the dielectric properties of the
system.

In the case of inﬁnite dilution limit, i.e. when concentration of one species (called a
solute) tends to zero and concentration of other (called a solvent) essentially determines
the total density, the DRISM equation can be decomposed as follows:
˜hvv(k)=[ ˜wv(k) + ˜Dv(k)ρv]˜cvv(k)[ ˜wv(k) + ρv ˜hvv(k)] + ˜Dv(k),
(2a)
˜huv(k)= ˜wu(k)˜cuv(k)[ ˜wv(k) + ρv ˜hvv(k)],
(2b)
˜huu(k)= ˜wu(k)˜cuu(k) ˜wu(k) + ˜wu(k)˜cuv(k)ρv ˜hvu(k),
(2c)
where ˜w(k) = ˜ω(k)ρ−1, ˜D(k) = ρ−1 ˜χ(k)ρ−1, and superscripts “u” and “v” refer to
“solute” and “solvent”, respectively. Equations (2) are solved with the hypernetted chain

The site-site mode-coupling theory

The site-site intermediate scattering function of neat solvent and its self-parts are obtained
by the generalized Langevin equation / modiﬁed mode-coupling theory for molecular liq-
uids as is described in the previous study by Yamaguchi et al. [22]. Generalized Langevin
equations for the neat solvent are given by

Description of the models

We performed explicit calculations for two popular systems, i.e. acetonitrile (CH3CN) in
water and methanol (CH3OH) in water, both in the case of inﬁnite dilution. As for the
structure and the intermolecular potential of water we employed a model of the extended
simple point charge (SPC/E) [29]. We also put the Lennard-Jones (LJ) core on the
hydrogen atoms in order to avoid the undesired divergence of the solution of the RISM
integral equation. The LJ parameters of the hydrogen atom, the depth of the well and
the diameter, are chosen to be 0.046 kcal/mol and 0.7 ˚A, respectively.

In acetonitrile and methanol the methyl group is considered to be a single interaction
site (Me) located on the methyl carbon atom. So that both chemical compounds consist
of three sites interacting through the pair potential [30, 31]

Numerical methods

From the generalized Langevin equation / modiﬁed mode-coupling theory and the DRISM
/HNC integral equation theory, the diﬀusion coeﬃcients and the reorientational relaxation
times of solute molecules in solution can be obtained based solely on the information about
molecular shapes, inertia parameters, intermolecular interaction potentials, temperature
and density. First, we calculated the site-site static structure factor by the DRISM/HNC
equation using the intermolecular interaction, molecular shape, temperature and density.
In order to improve the convergence of the RISM calculation, we used the method of the
modiﬁed direct inversion in an iterative space proposed by Kovalenko et al. [34]. From the
static site-site structure factor, we calculated the site-site intermediate scattering function
using the site-site generalized Langevin equation / modiﬁed mode-coupling theory. The
generalized Langevin equation is time-integrated numerically. The time-development of
the correlation functions in the k
0 limit is separately treated by the analytical limiting
→
procedure of the theoretical expressions. In the numerical procedure, the reciprocal space
is linearly discretized as k = (n + 1
2 )∆k, where n is the integer from 0 to Nk −
1. Values of
∆k and Nk are 0.061 ˚A−1 and 512, respectively. The diﬀusion coeﬃcient D was calculated

7

from the asymptotic slope of the time dependence of the mean square displacement and
the orientational relaxation time τ was analyzed using the rotational autocorrelation
functions.

Results and discussion

Figure 1 shows the density dependence of normalized diﬀusion coeﬃcients D/D0, with D0
being the diﬀusion coeﬃcient at the lowest density, for both acetonitrile (left part) and
methanol (right part) at four temperatures. Corresponding results for the orientational
relaxation time τ are shown in ﬁgure 2.
It has been found that diﬀusion coeﬃcients
of both acetonitrile and methanol at these temperatures decrease monotonically with
increase of density except for methanol at the lowest temperature, where one observes a
typical anomalous behavior: ﬁrst diﬀusion coeﬃcient increases, then decreases again. At
the same time, behavior of orientational relaxation time is diﬀerent for acetonitrile and
methanol at all studied temperatures, except at the highest. One can easily observe that
τ for acetonitrile exhibits the monotonic increase with density and monotonic decrease
of its absolute value with temperature [ﬁgure 2(a)], while τ for methanol at the same
temperatures ﬁrst decreases with density and then increases [ﬁgure 2(c)].
Its absolute
value is also getting smaller with temperature as in the case of acetonitrile. In such a
way, the density dependent orientational relaxation time for dissolved in water methanol
has an absolute minimum somewhere in between 0.9 g/cm3 and 1.1 g/cm3 for water and
the depth of this minimum is seen more clearly at lower temperatures. These tendencies
are observed sharply in ﬁgures 2(b) and 2(d) for acetonitrile and methanol, respectively,
where we plot normalized values of τ as τ /τ0 with τ0 being the orientational relaxation
time at the lowest density. Obtained results are in qualitative agreement with the outco-

The diﬀerence in behavior of acetonitrile and methanol can be made clear from the
point of view of their molecular structure. To begin with, let us remind that the anomalous

Figure 2: Density dependence of the orientational relaxation times for acetonitrile ((cid:4)) and methanol
(N) in water at diﬀerent temperatures.

et.al. [22] based on the facts of an almost spherical repulsive core for water and the strong
short-range intermolecular Coulomb interaction called “hydrogen bonding”. Following
the idea and owing to the models used in present manuscript, one can conclude that since
acetonitrile cannot make the hydrogen bonding and methanol does, this fact may be a
good candidate to serve as a reason or cause of justiﬁcation of the anomalous density
behavior of methanol (or possibly any protic solution) and usual one of acetonitrile (or
possibly any aprotic solution).

Summary

In present work we have calculated the temperature/density dependence of the transla-
tional diﬀusion coeﬃcients and rank-1 orientational relaxation times for acetonitrile and
methanol in water at inﬁnite dilution using the site-site generalized Langevin equation /
modiﬁed mode-coupling theory and the DRISM/HNC theory. Calculations show anoma-
lous density dependence of the orientational relaxation time for methanol in water which
is consistent with the results of experimental observation and MD simulation. On the
other hand, similar computation for acetonitrile does not exhibit deviation from the usual
behavior which is also in agreement with experiment and MD simulation. Such a diﬀer-
ence is explained based on the molecular structure of solvents, in particular their ability
(for methanol) and inability (for acetonitrile) to create hydrogen bonds. More studies will
be required for better understanding of the molecular dynamics in such systems.

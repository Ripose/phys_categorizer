Abstract

Some experimental evidences for methane are produced that the simple transition
from frequency scanning of nonlinear-optical resonances to magnetic one may be
accompanied with transition from sub-Doppler collisionally broadened structure to
sub-collision hyperﬁne one. It is conditioned by nonlinearity of splitting of hyperﬁne
sublevel for molecules in the adiabatically varied magnetic ﬁeld and respectively
breaking the analogy of magnetic and frequency scannings. The exact calculation of
the resonance structure is considered for molecules with only one spin subsystem.
The approximately spin-additive calculation of the structure is given for suﬃciently
fast rotating molecules with greater number of spin subsystems. Within the same
approximation an example of hyperﬁne doubling in the magnetic and electric spectra
of nonlinear-optical resonance is considered for ﬂuoromethane.

1 Introduction

Nonlinear-optical resonance (NOR) is considered here in the intensity of laser
radiation passed through molecular gas cell with low pressure (& 1 mtorr).
The laser frequency ω is tuned in a resonance with the frequency of spectral
line ωmn, corresponding to investigated vibration-rotation transition [m
n . The
requirement to its ﬁxing is practically absent and frequency detuning Ω =
ω

ωmn can be somewhere in limits of Doppler width of this line.

The NOR (or NOR spectrum) can be scanned with laser frequency (NOR/Fr,
i.e. NOR with frequency scanning). However we will take an interest in an
alternative method of NOR scanning by means of varying external ﬁeld while
the laser frequency is invariable. It is supposed, that the resonancely absorbing
gas is located in (spatially homogeneous and slowly 2 varied) magnetic (/M)
or electric (/E) ﬁeld; the latter is meaningful to use only if there is a sublevel
degeneration on parity. In both of the cases, there are two factors, namely,
the crossings of ﬁeld M-sublevels and the processes of their anti-crossings [in
other words, processes of their repulsion, caused by hyperﬁne interactions in
the initial (diagonalizing only ﬁeld interactions) basis of wave functions] take
place, respectively, with unequal and equal ﬁeld projections M of full angular
momentum Fj of a molecule in the hyperﬁne multiplets extracted by light,
(Jj, I ·) with j = m, n [in the parentheses, respectively, rotation angular mo-
mentum of the molecule and spins 3 of all its nuclei are designated] [2]. As a
matter of fact and it will be shown in the given paper, just these two factors
(and without collisional complexities) determine all major characteristics of
a ﬁeld spectrum of NOR. Let us underline the heterogeneity of the factors:
the ﬁrst is connected to diagonal elements of the interactions and the sec-
ond to oﬀ-diagonal ones. Under transition in ﬁnal (diagonalizing the sum of
ﬁeld and hyperﬁne interactions) wave function basis, the account of repulsing
interactions of sublevels brings to that the amplitudes of hyperﬁne compo-
nents of optical (electro-dipole) transition between these multiplets become
ﬁeld-dependent [3, Chap. 2
13]. Owing to the dependence, there are struc-
tures in ﬁeld spectra of NOR, which we shall name “ballast” ones, underlining
the energetic aspect of known process of anti-crossing of magnetic sublevels
[4,5]. With respect to Raman structures connected with crossings of magnetic
sublevels, ballast ones have always opposite sign. They are present only in
nonlinear-optical correction to a transmission of laser radiation and are ab-
sent in its birefringence. The ability of rotational (or, more precisely, vibration-
rotational) subsystem to absorb a laser radiation will increase with hyperﬁne
coupling of ballast spin subsystems. These ballast subsystems, if they are un-
coupled, do not naturally interact with light themselves (from here the term

“ballast”). Coupling (or uncoupling) implies a varying of hyperﬁne constants,
however we reach that by the smooth varying of the external ﬁeld, imposed
on molecule gas, absorbing radiation. In this case, disbalancing of nuclear spin
and rotation subsystems takes place, that can be eﬀectively considered as a
rupture of hyperﬁne couplings, see below (11). The disbalancing is possible
because of usual distinction of Zeeman frequencies of a precession, i.e., when
spin g-factor of any homogeneous nuclear subsystem of a molecule diﬀers from
rotation g-factor of the molecule. This preliminary qualitative picture will be
veriﬁed in the following sections of our paper, and also we shall slightly touch
upon linear Stark eﬀect with its analogous electric spectra.

The NOR with ﬁeld scanning (NOR/Fi, where option /Fi is /M or /E; one of
advantages for given ranking of the letters consists in that the variable part
of the abbreviation appears in the end) can be observed with various orien-
tations of (amplitudely varied) external ﬁeld B(0) with respect to direction of
wave vector k of laser radiation. The parallel or perpendicular orientation is
used and respectively designated by subscript,
after /Fi. The shape of
NOR/Fi spectrum essentially depends from polarization of laser radiation.

From the very beginning of our research, the term “anomalous”, appearing

for methane, implied

its sub-collision property, i.e. a disposition inside collision contour of the res-
onance. It is necessary to take into account, that the constants of hyperﬁne
interactions (HFI) in methane did not exceed its collision constant ν for our
working pressure (& 1 mtorr). The adequate theoretical model of NOR/M
with this unusual property had ﬁnd out only after the computer calculations,
carried out for methane with the exact account of all its HFI.

NOR/Fr allows to look inside of inhomogeneous Doppler contour of a line.
NOR/Fi, as we shall show below, allows to look inside of homogeneous collision
contour of the same line, and we can observe a sub-collision hyperﬁne structure
(HFS) [see below the respective equations (83), (85), and (89)].

Sometimes the ﬁeld spectroscopy can be the real alternative to the frequency
one. It is important, which type of ﬁeld structures is selected. In the meantime
it appears that the ballast HFS of NOR/Fi is more convenient and informa-
tive than Raman one. In this case the ﬁeld spectroscopy can be viewed as
a spectroscopy of intramolecular tops. We consider its variants for molecu-
lar levels without doubling and with doubling on parity. Respectively, our
examples will be the molecules of methane and ﬂuoromethane. For the ﬁrst
molecule all hyperﬁne (spin-rotation) constants can be spectrally determined,
but for the second one they can be only partially determined from the spec-
tra. Here to the aid there come researches of spin conversion in molecules
[6,7,8]. These additional researches open a possibility of the determination of
those hyperﬁne constants, which do not usually completely aﬀect the spectra.

3

The combined solution of these problems allows to receive the complete set of
hyperﬁne spin-rotation constants for molecules of ﬂuoromethane symmetry.

The purpose of this work is the theoretical research of inﬂuence hyperﬁne
(spin-rotation) interactions on NOR/Fi in molecules of methane and ﬂuo-
romethane symmetry. For it we are going:

to analyze the probable reasons of appearance for “anomalous” structures
•
of NOR/M in methane. It is necessary to make a choice between two models,
one of theirs takes into account a HFS, other — a collision structure (it is
exacter, a collision-hyperﬁne one).

to apply the mathematical means that are adequate to the problem, i.e.
•
permitting to simplify the analysis of NOR/Fi caused by a multiplet structure
of resonance levels.

to receive an approximation (i.e. the ﬁrst summands of expansion on a small
•
2) for NOR/Fi in a case, when researched multispin molecule is
parameter J −
in fast rotation states, and to apply the approximation to methane and ﬂuo-
romethane. In the latter case we take into account hyperﬁne parity doubling
for rotation JK-levels with K = 1.

2 Some experimental evidences for a sub-collision structure

of NOR/M

When HFS of levels is absent or can be neglect, in a polarizing nonlinear
sub-Dopppler spectroscopy there is a useful analogy between magnetic and
frequency scanning of NOR. Let us begin from its brief description, see [9].
Let we have molecules in a gas cell and are capable optically to initiate electro-
dipole transitions [m
n between two molecular vibration-rotation levels labelled
with j = m, n and degenerated on magnetic projections MJj of rotation an-
gular momentum with Jj = max(MJj ). We shall connect collision relaxation
constants (level half-width νj and transition one ν) by means of an equation
νm + νn = 2ν; in all our examples it will completely be νj = ν. The gas cell
is located in a varied magnetic ﬁeld B(0) = B(0)uz and through it along the
ﬁeld a bichromatic 4 light wave is propagated. Its electrical component

With Raman scattering of light, when there are two contrarily polarized pho-
tons in the combinative transitions, the considered multilevel system is a set
of three-level subsystems ∨- and ∧-types. These two-photon transitions go

tions between levels and the multipole transitions between sublevels. Therefore
their relaxational constants ν and νj aﬀect NOR together. However for us its
three components [being responsible for eﬀects of population changing (Ben-
nett’s holes), nonlinear interference (NIF) and ﬁeld splitting] are not separated
and are contained in both summands ∨m

Our transition to research of NOR/M in methane molecules had correlated
with a paper [12], where some collision broadening of NOR/M in neon atoms
was researched. From this paper there was a tendency to research some col-
lision properties of these resonances. It allowed us to use the experimental
parameters tuned evidently far from that were used in the detection of HFS
of methane NOR/Fr [13]. In particular, the working pressure in our methane
cell was on an order above and our signal of NOR/M disappeared in noise
with pressure decreasing to their magnitudes. Thus, the subject of our work
was born unexpectedly and undeliberately, in the experiment originally ori-
ented on research of collision properties of methane NOR/M. At that time its
“anomalous” sub-collision structure was found out. NOR/M was observed in
the intensity of linearly polarized infrared (IR) radiation of He-Ne/12CH4 laser
without frequency tuning. This radiation has wave length λ = 3.39 µm and
well hits in the absorption bands of vibration-rotation spectrum of methane
isotopes, namely, 7 [ω3(0
1) P (6)] of 13CH4
[14]. Our in-cavity cell was completely elongated in the solenoidal magnetic
scanner and portionly ﬁlled with methane at pressure P = 1
10 mtorr. The
laser radiation was propagated through the cell along scanner magnetic ﬁeld
B(0). Its amplitude B(0) slowly varied from some chosen level B(0)

angularly impulse modulation of the ﬁeld in the limits between B(0)

with frequency f (
rather small diﬀerence signal Sf (B(0)) = 2
0 )]; here the max-
imum factor 2/π corresponds to rectangular impulse porousness = 2. The
typical record (scan) of this signal (being symmetric with respect to B(0) = 0)
is shown in Fig. 1. S(0) is input radiation intensity. Here the anomalously nar-
row structure clearly emerges from the background represented by wide peak
having frequency analog (2). The uncommonness of the situation is that we
are with pressure P , when collision half-width ν

It is necessary to note, that, except the methane transmission, the sub-collision
structure of NOR/M was recorded in its circular birefringence [20], see below
an expression (84).

First published and unsuccessful 10 attempts [19] to interpret these structures
were based on a model which is taking into account the collision in-summands
in kinetic equations (4) for both resonance levels. It was considered, that
the model of relaxational constants, which are taking into account only the
collision out-summands in the kinetic equations (without in-summands), is
insuﬃcient for the interpretation. The authors of cited paper tried to explain
the narrow structures of NOR/M for linearly polarized radiation by means of
collision changing a velocity of molecules and forming the collision interference
resonance [9]. One more collision model was chosen in [21], where the possibil-
ity of complete intermixing for population of hyperﬁne sublevels by means of
deorientation collisions without velocity modiﬁcation was taken into account.
However, it was gradually found out (see section 5), that the collision model
(as in itself and with the account of HFS) is not capable to describe ade-
quately an observable resonance structure particularly for circularly polarized

It depends on molecular velocity projection vk = v

The statistical and dynamic summands enter in the right side of this equation.
Statistical ones are represented by spontaneous one ˆR(vk, rk, t) and collision
one ˆS(vk, rk, t). Dynamic ones are represented by a commutator with Hamil-
tonian ˆH(rk, t). Here we are going to consider NOR/M for vibration-rotation
transitions of molecules. These transitions usually hit in IR area of frequency
spectrum, where it is possible to do not take ˆR(vk, rk, t) into account com-
pletely. Let us remark only, that the spontaneous structure of NOR/M begins
to be revealed in visible frequency area, when the electronic transitions are
considered, and its analysis will be submitted in paper [22].

and also their ruptures with growth of the magnetic ﬁeld and unbalancing

notice, that HFS of NOR/M can be observed only if some ∆ς
I diﬀers from ∆J .
Just in this case it is possible to speak about a rupture of hyperﬁne connec-
tion of the appropriate nuclear spin with molecular rotation momentum. In
a weak magnetic ﬁeld the precession of total angular momentum takes place
around of the ﬁeld direction. With increasing value of the ﬁeld the preces-
sion nuclear spins and molecular rotation momentum becomes more and more
independent, and they cease to form the conserved total angular momentum.

accordance with selection rules [see (40) and further between (80) and (81)],
the spectral manifestations of four-level diagrams with unequal (both lower
and upper) indices are essentially weakened. The situation is better, when
there is index coincidence only in one pair of lower or upper levels, that gives
the Raman three-level diagrams, respectively, ∨- or ∧-types. Their spectral
manifestations, as “Raman HFS” of the same types, are conditioned by ap-
propriate complex resonance co-factor from the pair disposed in denominator
of expression (65b) (the complexity can be manifested only in the diagrams

coincidences in both upper and lower level pairs give the two-level diagrams of
≬≬≬-types. The collision constants then enter only in a simple nonresonance fac-
tor ν2/νmνn, and all resonance feature are determined with ﬁeld dependence
of real numerator of expression (65b). We have introduced the name “ballast
HFS” for resonance structures of the last type. In the pure state they are
present in the transmission of circularly polarized radiation. Their distinctive
feature is always negative sign with respect to Raman HFS. It is possible to
make certain of it, e.g., using just described expansion of expression (65b)
on components: ≬≬≬ + ∨ + ∧ +✶. It is easy to see, that all the components,
except last one, are positive. For transitions with changing Jj, the last one

can be rejected, as it has the next smallness order J −

i.e., if the radiation is circularly polarized, the total expression (65b) with any
B(0) near resonance, is always less than its wing value, when B(0) is large. The
ﬁrst summand in (66) is always resonance. The residuals are completely or
partially suppressed (in according to whether ν = 0 or not) because of their
nonresonance character connected to anti-crossings of the diagram levels. With
large ν all four summands in sum (66) reproduce the wing.

For multi-spin molecule the resonance for circularly polarized radiation con-
sists of several dips. These dips are manifested, when light interacts with
rotation subsystem and feels that the hyperﬁne coupling of any spin subsys-
tem (as a ballast) take place. Thus, unlike Raman scattering, the gas medium
property to absorb light is increased. The light energy indirectly comes in
nuclear spin subsystems and is spent on ﬂipping nuclear spins of molecule.

An elementary mechanical model, imitating the ballast structure of the spec-
trum, consists of two interacting tops. E.g., let they will be a pencil vertically
clamped in hands and a gramophone plate freely pined upon it. The pencil
here corresponds to rotation subsystem and the plate — to ballast spin one.
The small friction between them corresponds to hyperﬁne coupling (without
precession). Twisting the pencil between hands we shall imitate an inﬂuence
of light to our molecule being capable of its absorption. The frequency of
twisting is analog of a collision frequency ν, restricting the inﬂuence of light.
Comparing these absorption capabilities determined with the low and high
frequencies, it is not diﬃcult to see that it is higher in the ﬁrst case than in
the second one. In the ﬁrst case the pencil and the plate rotate together as
a whole. In the second case the pencil rotates, practically not having time to

26

pull about the pined plate. 29

In other (equivalent) interpretation the ballast structure — the manifestation
of anti-crossings of hyperﬁne magnetic sublevels [5]. For the ﬁrst time this
structure was observed in resonance ﬂuorescence of lithium atoms [4]. As it is
known [9], the structure of ﬁeld spectra in nonlinear transmission of pumping
(47) is analogous 30 to the structure in resonance ﬂuorescence [3]

Here nonlinear cubic susceptibility (55) or diﬀerently fourth rank tensor (50)
of gas medium is contracted twice with e and twice with f , respectively,
the unit polarization vectors of optical pumping (excitation) and resonance
ﬂuorescence; also it is noted, that the multiplet structure of lower level (n) in
resonance ﬂuorescence of upper one (m) is not manifested (and that ensures
the real value of contracted expression). However, the analogy and comparison
are possible only theoretically, as both ordinary and resonance ﬂuorescences
in our IR range are practically unobservable, unlike nonlinear transmission of
pumping.

As an example to the described classiﬁcation we shall represent the results of
in
exact calculations of formula (65b) with use of a computer, for NOR/M
k
radiation transmission of methane isotope 12CH4. In Fig. 5, concerning to a
linearly polarized radiation, the Raman HFS is shown obviously with impurity
of ballast. The purely Raman HFS consists of peaks only and never passes
below than wing level at large B(0). The purely ballast HFS is shown in next
Fig. 6, concerning to circularly polarized radiation. It is practically symmetric
dip, 31 displaced to the right 32 for rightly polarized radiation. 33 The dip for
contrary polarized radiation is obtained by mirror reﬂection with respect to
ordinate axis, i.e. its shift has opposite sign. The shift does not practically
depend on pressure. With increasing ν on an order, from 10 to 100 kHza, the
width on half-depth and the depth of the dip are approximately doubled and
quartered, respectively.

To facilitate a comparison with the above-represented experimental data,
derivatives are shown in Fig. 7, and they appropriate to the previous two
FIGs. Judging by amplitude ratio of narrow and wide structures for linearly
polarized radiation, the experimental curves in Fig. 2 at the left correspond

sis it is convenient to describe an existing small quantity of dip asymmetry
for circularly polarized radiation in the following way. On a curve, represent-

module of amplitude of this derivative is maximum, by means of coordinates

to what circular polarization is considered. The quantity of dip asymmetry
y0/y1|
is now determined as ay = 1
. Judging by Fig. 7, this quantity is
small and also changes its sign at ν
30 kHza. There is a feature observed

in Fig. 7 only with small ν, when the second ﬁeld derivative in the area of
resonance (without wings) begins to have four zero points instead of two ones.
It is possible to estimate the position of the feature, changing the asymmetry
sign, as (28). 34 It is approximately greater by factor of √2 than the dip shift
or otherwise the position of its lower point, see below (88).

Without HFS, according to (2c), the amplitude ratio of peaks at zero ﬁeld is

similar amplitude ratio of peaks at nonzero ﬁelds. We mention in passing that
the approximation, represented in the next section 4, is not suﬃcient for real
deriving of this ratio.

In appendix the classiﬁcation, represented here for HFS of NOR/M, under-
stands on a simple model case, when both level angular momenta and spin are
equal 1/2. Let us note, that the case does not concern directly to the molecules
considered by us, and what is more the case does not concern also to atoms. In
their visible frequency area, instead of HFS an other structure goes out on the
ﬁrst plan, namely, spontaneous one, connected with the induced two-photon
absorption through an intermediate spontaneous decay [22].

Coming back to the formulae (65), we shall note the following. Here we use
only the expression (65b), but the initial expression (65a) can be invariantly
calculated, i.e. without the help of speciﬁc basis of wave functions. Properly

30

using only commutation relations for tensor components of operators included
in it, at ﬁrst the trace
may be calculated, and then time integrals. An-
other alternative calculation way is possible also, permitting to interchange the

From here at once, using the basis (21a), the equation (65b) is obtained.
However it is possible to calculate the expression (69), as well as (65a), without
concretizing the basis set of wave functions. In the given paper we shall not
go into more details of these two ways of calculation.

The model, used by us, has simple and rather reliable basis in itself. What
concerns a comparison with methane experiment, here a discussion can go
only about details. E.g., if someone will interest collision components, their
calculation in the model of strong deorientational collisions is produced below
in section 5. One may assume that the transition to other molecules is more
actual. The main (hyperﬁne) structure of the ﬁeld spectrum of NOR will be
thus involved. E.g., in section 6 the molecule of ﬂuoromethane is considered.

Thus, after passage by linearly polarized radiation of absorbing cell, its ﬁeld
spectrum acquires components, which look as peaks in amplitude measure-
ments. They are conditioned by process of resonance scattering with crossings
of hyperﬁne sublevels in magnetic ﬁeld, when [2q∆J +
q] = 0
(m, n). The greatest amplitude has peak 46 at ﬁeld zero, due to large
with j
number of sublevel crossings. Peaks are grouped in area of nonzero ﬁelds,
where (27), from single crossings in sublevel pairs with
= 2 and
1. For 12CH4 with rather low pressure there are only two such
′j = ˜µH
˜µH
areas located mutually symmetrically from ﬁeld zero. For 13CH4 with similar
pressure these areas of crossings are split on pairs (˜µH, ˜µC); in the beginning
(
2), if we scan from ﬁeld zero (appropriate FIGs.

are omitted). The half-width of these peaks is determined by magnitude ν/2γ
with slightly distinguishing γ-factors varying near γJ . If we direct ν to zero,
when magnetic ﬁeld is non-peak, we shall receive (∨m
0. This
property is unconnected with the approximation, used in (82), and kept in
exact calculation. In Fig. 5, i.e. in amplitude measurements (48), the Raman
peaks is observed on the background of both ballast dips. In any way the res-
onance curve below than wing level could not be lowered without theirs. As
we have already noted, the last ones disappear in phase measurements. When

for all ς, the Raman structure of NOR/M smooths out and we see
single (practically Lorentz) contour with half-width ν/2γJ (see Fig. 1). Its top
is nevertheless sharpened, according to (83). Because of its small amplitude
it is better to observe the cusp in the ﬁeld derivatives of transmission, as in
Fig. 7, or 47 circular birefringence (84), as in [20].

The form of observed ﬁeld spectrum essentially depends on the choice of mu-
tual orientation of varied magnetic and ﬁxed laser ﬁelds and on the polariza-
tion of the latter. The ballast structure from spin subsystem ς is manifested
as sub-collision one (again with respect to collision Raman non-hyperﬁne one

51 Practically it is just the same one in exact calculation of the previous section.
52 It would be good to specify (e.g., numerically) its behavior for nonzero ﬁelds with
exact calculation.

There is such choice of mutual orientation of ﬁelds, with which the ﬁeld spec-
troscopy reﬂects just the rupture of spin-rotation connections and the ballast
structure is visible without Raman one at all. For that the amplitude-scanned
magnetic ﬁeld should be directed or along propagation of circularly polar-
ized radiation (B(0)
k; it is longitudinal (Faraday) ﬁeld orientation), or
across propagation of linearly polarized radiation as its vector of electrical
ﬁeld (B(0)
E(ω); it is transverse (Voigt) ﬁeld orientation). It is visible that
there are two summands in square brackets of (86d), describing the dip for
longitudinal ﬁeld orientation (q =
1). At Jmn = 0 [Q(Jn)-lines] there is only
second one for transverse ﬁeld orientation (q = 0).

Let us note, that it is suﬃcient to complete the expansion on J −
(main) summand with ﬁeld structure, and this suﬃcient precision of expansion
is various for linear and circular polarization. Just the same we act further in
section 6, in case of CH3F, and there the expansion precision is various for
K = 1 and K
= 1. At last, as it was noted in previous section, the transition
to ﬁeld spectral derivatives is convenient by that allows to level amplitudes of
structures from diﬀerent orders of expansion because of occasionally appro-
priate distinction of their widths.

If we leave aside the numerical comparison, 53 the represented approximation
reproduces practically all the qualitative features of magnetic spectrum of
NOR, obtained under the exact formula (65b) [at least so long as we are not
interested in such details, as small asymmetries (of dip in particular) noted by
us under analysis of FIGs. attending the formula]. For simple estimations it is
possible to use the undermentioned formula (98) representing a combination
of hyperﬁne and collision structures.

Field derivatives of NOR/M (in just described approximation) for two carbon-
substituted methane isotopes are represented in Fig. 8. The evaluation of ν was
made by selection of a curve in Fig. 7 with amplitude ratio of narrow and wide
resonance structures in intensity of linearly polarized radiation, approaching
to similar ratio in Fig. 2 at the left. In the approximation of resonance scat-
tering of contrarily polarized photons we have taken into account only (most
= 0. In order that the amplitude ratio of
strong) main transitions with
appropriate curves for linearly and circularly polarized radiations in Fig. 8 at
the left was the same as in Fig. 2 at the left, it is apparently required side
2 . For
by side with (82) to take into account already next corrections
both isotopes we use the same evaluation of ν, since their working areas of
pressures coincided.

These estimated data are obtained on separately taken curve. The work on
increasing precision in the determination of hyperﬁne constants by our method
was not carried out. The approximating curves in Fig. 8 correspond just to
these values of constants. The opposite signs of average spin-rotation constants
indicate that the intramolecular magnetic ﬁelds near to nuclei 13C and 1H have
opposite directions. The sign change of the constant for nucleus 13C indicates
that its negative electronic component prevails over positive nuclear one [26].

by high-J approximation

Since the analysis of paper [21], both formulae and conclusions, is compli-
cated by mistakes existing there, we are here forced to adduce more right (in
our opinion) formulae, on which our conclusions about unacceptability of the
collision interpretation “anomalous” structures are based.

Taking into account deorientational in-summand for level populations [9,21]
the collision summand (5) turns in

ˆSij(vk, rk, t) = δi,j

Now here there are deorientational constant ˜νj and its modiﬁcation ˜˜νj = ˜νj/[j].
As far as the deorientational in-summand from other sublevels of level j has
˜νj), so
been extracted we have to subtract it in the pumping, where νj →

The superscript ˜ is deﬁned in (50). Practically all the features in NOR/M
depend here on convergence (for peak in NOR/M) and divergence (for dips
in NOR/M) of one-photon components in stepped two-photon processes of
⊔- and ⊓-types through intermediate collisional deorientation. In the conven-
tional type designations given here both side vertical segments and interme-
diate horizontal segment,

, correspond to them, respectively.

or

As well as in (82), with high Jj of resonance levels, the calculation of collision
structure of NOR/M is possible, taking into consideration only main opti-
1-corrections dependent on

cal transitions with
magnetic ﬁeld). The exact expression (92b) becomes simpler and for linearly
polarized radiation we obtain the collision addend to (82):

In paper [21] the formula (5.9) is similar to ours (95) but has slightly diﬀerent

in our designations, in the denominator of our formula (95) it is necessary to
make replacement ωςmn

for M3. With this replacement the qualitative interpretation of the formula

collision half-width of rotational J-levels is much greater half-width of their
hyperﬁne splitting. 62 However its shift is opposite to the shift of experimen-
tally observed dip. Our analysis shows, that the collision structure (95) is
appreciably asymmetric. Owing to (101), the level of the collision structure
component in (98) for B(0) = 0 practically is at the level of its wings for
large B(0) (by more exact consideration, ﬁrst one more and more approaches
to second one with increase of J), and this property in Fig. 3 of [21] is not
looked through. The almost symmetric shifted dip is experimentally observed
in transmission of circularly polarized radiation (one can see its derivative in
Fig. 2 at the left). As the formulae (95) and (98) are shown, on the place of this
observed dip the collision model with anyone ν gives peak connected to the

7 Conclusion

In the present work we have tried to ﬁnd out the features inherited to NOR/Fi
for molecular levels with HFS. It is possible to divide HFS of NOR/Fi into two
essentially distinguishing types — Raman (∨ or ∧) and ballast (≬≬≬) ones. We
think that it is important to note sub-collision character of already observed
HFS of ﬁeld spectra, namely, ballast and, in zero ﬁeld, Raman ones. Still un-
observed Raman HFS in nonzero ﬁelds has not similar property. It can be only
found out with the same lower pressure as for HFS of NOR/Fr. It is possible
to observe Raman HFS separated from ballast one in circular birefringence.
Ballast HFS is always added to existing Raman one in transmission, but can
be observed in the absence of the latter by choosing properly geometry and
polarization of ﬁelds. The existence of the ﬁeld spectral structure then directly

The considered purely hyperﬁne model of NOR/Fi practically does not contain

(corrections) with their not quite deﬁned parameter ˜νj/(νj −
their functional behavior does not correlate with experimental data at all], the
model gives quite acceptable description of (anomalous) sub-collision structure
of NOR/M for methane isotopes.

Under exact account of hyperﬁne interaction, realized by us before its approxi-

It is well known, that the requirements to frequency control of laser radiation
are essentially weakened with ﬁeld recording of NOR spectra in comparison
with frequency one. We have now added to it another new (and important
enough) its property, namely, sub-collision character of observed HFS. A com-
parison with paper [13] (see also [49]) here suﬃces, where the frequency record-
ing of NOR was used. For detection of HFS of NOR they needed to decrease
pressure . 0.1 mtorr and increase the radius of laser beam & 1.8 cm.

The set of molecules, which HFS can be researched with the help of NOR/M,
is numerous enough, see review [50]. At that it is necessary to distinguish
HFS under electro-quadrupole and magneto-dipole interactions. In the men-
tioned review the authors have collected the data on super-collision 67 HFS of
NOR/Fr for halogen-substituted methanes (except ﬂuoromethane, which spin-
rotation HFS is only magneto-dipole and sub-collision and therefore practically
not observed with NOR/Fr). The manifestation of HFS under ﬁeld recording
of molecule spectrum is based on rupture of spin-rotation connection, and
there should be half-spin nuclei (or their sets) in the molecule. The nuclei
with greater spin have the hardly ruptured connection, conditioned their too
strong electro-quadrupole interaction with rotation of molecule as whole, and
are not included in our consideration.

We shall now describe our basic results some more:

The analysis of both purely hyperﬁne and collision-hyperﬁne models has

shown that it is suﬃcient to have only one collision constant ν, describing re-
laxation of levels and transition extracted by light, for calculation of “anoma-

lous” structure of methane NOR/M. The account of the features of collision
populating of the levels (e.g., through the deorientation of their hyperﬁne mag-
netic sublevels) is apparently important only for details and corrections. More
deﬁnitely the statement can be refered to investigated area of methane pres-
sure, between 3 and 6 mtorr, and the used laser Gaussian beam with radius
0.5 cm. The anomalous structure of methane NOR/M [18,19] looks
r1/ e ≃
as sub-collision one, i.e. observed inside homogeneous width of levels (tak-
ing into account the gyromagnetic scale 2γJ). It is conditioned by diﬀerence
(in methane case, on an order) between nuclear spin g-factors and molecular
rotation g-factor. By nature this structure is basically hyperﬁne and not colli-
sion or collision-hyperﬁne. The ﬁeld spectra of NOR break collision limit and
facilitate the investigation of sub-collision HFS of molecules.

Since the theoretical model of observed structures is based on the account
•
of hyperﬁne structure of levels, mathematical means, simplifying the analysis
and making it independent from basis set of wave functions, are operator ones.
Carrying out analytic calculations, it is necessary, as far as possible, to keep
away from any representation of operators. Some ways have proposed for it in
the end of section 3.

The approximation of HFS of NOR/M for multi-spin and fast rotated
•
molecules is obtained. Using the approximation and appropriate experimental
data, it was possible to obtain (at estimation level for the present time) the
hyperﬁne constant C 13C
of 13CH4 isotope, which value is well coordinated with
its NMR data. In the same way both NOR/M
, conditioned
with hyperﬁne doubling of levels have calculated for ﬂuoromethane, that can
facilitate their real observation.

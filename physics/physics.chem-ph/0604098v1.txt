Abstract

Low-energy electron collisions with O2 molecules are studied using the ﬁxed-bond R-matrix

method. In addition to the O2 X 3Σ−

g ground state, integrated cross sections are calculated for

elecron collisions with the a1∆g and b1Σ+

g excited states of O2 molecules. 13 target electronic states

of O2 are included in the model within a valence conﬁguration interaction representations of the

target states. Elastic cross sections for the a1∆g and b1Σ+

INTRODUCTION

An understanding of electron collision processes with oxygen molecules is important be-

cause of its role in chemistry of electrical discharge and the upper atmosphere. In recent

attempts to an operate electrical discharge oxygen-iodine laser, a population inversion of
iodine atoms was achieved by a near resonant energy transfer via the O2(a1∆g) + I(2P3/2) ↔
O2(X 3Σ−
g ) + I(2P1/2) process. In contrast to the traditional liquid chemistry singlet oxygen
generator [1], recent studies [2, 3] utilize ﬂowing electric discharges where electron collisions

with O2 excited electronic states can be important [4, 5]. In such conditions, even highly
u , A′3∆u, A3Σ+
excited metastable states of O2(c1Σ−
lower O2 a1∆g and b1Σ+

u ) may play roles [6], in addition to the

g excited states.

However, most previous work has concentrated on electron collisions with the O2(X 3Σ−
g )
ground state, so our knowledge of electron impact transitions from the O2a1∆g and b1Σ+
g

excited states is limited. The past experimental and theoretical works concerning electron
O2(X 3Σ−
g , a1∆g) collisions were summarized by Brunger and Buckman [7]. One work on the
excited electronic states is measurement of diﬀerential and integral cross sections at 4.5 eV

Also, Khakoo et al. [9] studied the energy-loss spectrum for electron impact excitation on
1Πu (v′=0,1,..7). Burrow
discharged O2 and assigned the transitions O2 a1∆g (v=0) → O2
[10] and Beli´c and Hall [11] studied dissociative electron attachment with the O2 a1∆g state.
The later authors found that dissociation proceeds to 3 diﬀerent limits, O−(2P )+O(3P ),
O−(2P )+O(1D) and O−(2P )+O(1S).

In contrast to the situation in electron collisions with the excited oxygen molecule, a lot

of work has been performed on the ground state O2, both experimental [12, 13, 14, 15, 16]

and theoretical [12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21]. Notably, Noble, Burke and their co-

workers extensively applied their R-matrix method to the electron O2 collision problems

during 1992-1996 [14, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20, 21]. They studied electronic excitation processes
from the O2(X 3Σ−

g ) ground state to the a1∆g, b1Σ+

u , A′3∆u and A3Σ+

u states using

g , c1Σ−

the ﬁx-bond R-matrix method [18, 19] and applied the non-adiabatic R-matrix method to
vibrational excitations process of the X 3Σ−
They also calculated diﬀerential cross sections for elastic electron collisions of the X 3Σ−

g (v = 0 − 4) transitions [20, 21].
g state

g (v = 0) → X 3Σ−

[15] as well as impact excitations from the X 3Σ−

g states [14].
The eﬀect of nuclear motion was included in the former elastic cross sections by vibrational

g state to the a1∆g and b1Σ+

averaging of the T-matrix [15]. Other than these R-matrix calculations, Teillet-Billy et al.
[12] applied eﬀective range theory (ERT) to excitations from the X 3Σ−
g to the a1∆g and b1Σ+
states. Because of the diﬀerent treatment of the O−
2 resonances, the ERT results deviate

g

from the R-matrix cross sections at energies above 5 eV.

Given the importance of electron collisions with excited O2 molecules, we perform R-

matrix calculations for electron O2(a1∆g,b1Σ+

g ) collisions. We chose the R-matrix method

because it has been successfully applied to many electron-molecule collisions including e-N2,

N2O and H2O [22, 23, 24]. The ﬁxed-bond method was employed in this work, because it
gave reasonably good results in previous studies [17, 18, 19] for transitions from the O2 X 3Σ−
g
state to the a1∆g, b1Σ+

g state, and the ‘6 eV states’ (c1Σ−

u +A′3∆u+A3Σ+

u ). In addition to

these 6 low lying O2 target states, previous calculations included three higher excited target
states of O2 B3Σ−

u , in order to improve quality of the R-matrix calculations

u ,11∆u and f ′1Σ+

[18, 19]. In this work, we use a valence complete active space description of the O2 target
states and add other valence target states, 11Πg,13Πg,11Πu,13Πu, in our calculations. Since
u ,11∆u and f ′1Σ+
excitation energies of some of these states are lower than those of B3Σ−
states, some improvement can be expected by inclusion of these extra Π target states.

u

In principle, a complete valence active space is not suﬃcient for the description of these

targets, because some of them are mixed with n=3 Rydberg states as described in Buenker

and Peyerimhoﬀ [25, 26]. Since expansion of this active space increases the calculation cost

considerably, we limit ourselves here the inclusion of the valence states to test the eﬀects of

the higher excited states.

In this paper, details of the calculations are presented in section 2, and we discuss the

results in section 3 comparing our results with previous theoretical and available experiments.

Then the summary is given in section 4.

II. THEORETICAL METHODS

The R-matrix method has been described extensively in the previous literature [23, 24,

27], so here we only repeat the outline of the method. In this method, conﬁguration space

is divided by two regions according to the distance rN +1 of the scattering electron and

the center of mass of the target molecule having N electrons. In the inner region rN +1 <

a, the N+1 electrons problem is solved by usual quantum chemistry method with slight

modiﬁcations to account for existence of boundary at rN +1 = a. In the inner region, the

total N+1 electrons wave functions are represented by N-electron CI target wave functions

augmented by diﬀuse functions. Here the target wave functions are contained in the sphere

rN +1 < a, whereas the diﬀuse functions overlap the boundary at rN +1 = a in order to

describe the scattering electron.

In the outer region rN +1 > a, the problem is reduced

to single electron scattering, ignoring exchange of the scattering electron with the target

electrons. Interaction of the scattering electron and the target is considered through static

multipolar interaction terms which introduce inter-channel couplings. The wave functions

obtained in the inner region are converted to the R-matrix at the boundary rN +1=a, then

the coupled radial Schr¨odinger equations are solved so as to extract scattering information

at the asymptotic region.

In the inner region, the N+1 electronic wavefunctions are expanded as,

Ψ = A X

Φi (1...N; R) uj (N + 1; R) aij + X

Xq (1...N + 1; R) bq,

(1)

ij

q

where A is an antisymmetrization operator, Φi are the N electron target CI wave functions,

uj are the diﬀuse functions representing wave functions of a scattering electron, and Xq

are bound N+1 electron wave functions, while aij and bq are variational coeﬃcients. In this

expression, the ﬁrst term represents the scattering of an electron from and to the asymptotic
region. The second summation involves purely L2 integrable terms. In addition to the target

molecular orbitals included in the CI wavefunctions in the ﬁrst summation, some extra target

virtual orbitals are usually included in Xq in order to account for short range polarization

eﬀects.

We used a modiﬁed version of the polyatomic programs in the UK molecular R-matrix

codes [27]. These programs utilize gaussian type orbitals (GTO) to represent target molecule

as well as a scattering electron. Although most of past R-matrix works on electron O2

4

collisions had employed the diatomic modules using Slater type orbitals (STO) obtained by

Hartree Fock(HF) calculation, we select GTO mainly because of simplicity of the input and

availability of basis functions. The state averaged complete active space SCF (SA-CASSCF)

orbitals are imported from the target calculations with MOLPRO suites of programs [28].

This employment of SA-CASSCF orbitals improves the vertical excitation energies of the

O2 target states compared to the energies obtained using HF orbitals. These target orbitals

are constructed from the [5s,3p] contracted basis of Dunning [29] augmented by a d function

with exponent 1.8846, as in Sarpal et al. [30]. In the R-matrix calculations, we included 13
target states; X 3Σ−
u , 11Πg,13Πg,11Πu and
13Πu, where the last 4 Π states were not included in previous calculations. The potential

u ,11∆u, f ′1Σ+

g ,a1∆g, b1Σ+

u ,B3Σ−

g ,c1Σ−

energy curves of these target electronic states are shown in ﬁgure 1 for reference. Further

details of these target electronic states can be found in Saxon and Liu [31] and Minaev and

Minaeva [32] for example. In our ﬁxed-bond R-matrix calculations, these target states are
evaluated at the equilibrium bond length R = 2.3 a0 of the O2 X 3Σ−

g ground electronic

state. Note that all calculations were performed with D2h symmetry because of restriction

of the polyatomic UK R-matrix codes, though natural symmetry of this system is D∞h.

The radius of the R-matrix sphere a was chosen to be 10 a0 in our calculations. In order

to represent the scattering electron, we included diﬀuse gaussian functions up to l=5 with

9 functions for l=0, 7 functions for l=1-3 and 6 functions for l=4 and 5. The exponents

of these gaussians were ﬁtted using the GTOBAS program [33] in the UK R-matrix codes.

Details of the ﬁtting procedure are the same as in Faure et al.

[33]. We constructed the

N +1 electron conﬁgurations from the orbitals listed in table I. The CI target wave functions

are composed from the valence orbitals in table I with the 1ag and 1b1u orbitals kept doubly

occupied. The ﬁrst terms in equation (1) are constructed from conﬁgurations of the form,

g1b2

1u{2ag3ag1b2u1b3u2b1u3b1u1b3g1b2g}12

3B1g(cid:17) {2b1g...17b1g}1

2Ag(cid:17) ,

(cid:16)

(cid:16)

(2)

here we assume that the total symmetry of this 17 electrons system is 2Ag. The ﬁrst
4 electrons are always kept in the 1ag and 1b1u orbitals, then the next 12 electrons are
distributed over the valence orbitals with restriction of target state symmetry, 3B1g symmetry

of the O2 ground state in this case. The last electron, the scattering electron, occupies one

of the diﬀuse orbitals, B1g symmetry in this example. To complete the wave function with
the total symmetry 2Ag, we also have to include conﬁgurations with the other target states

5

combined with diﬀuse orbitals having appropriate symmetry in the same way as in the

example. The second terms in equation (1) are constructed from conﬁgurations,

1a2

g1b2

3B1g(cid:17) {1b1g}1

(cid:16)

2Ag(cid:17) ,

(cid:16)

(3)

where the scattering electron occupies a bound 1b1g extra virtual orbital, instead of the

diﬀuse continuum orbitals in the expression (2). As in table I, we included one extra virtual

orbital for each symmetry. The second terms in equation (1) also contain conﬁgurations of

the form

1a2

g1b2

1u{2ag3ag1b2u1b3u2b1u3b1u1b3g1b2g}13

2Ag(cid:17) .
(cid:16)

(4)

In this case, the last 13 electrons including the scattering electron are distributed over
the valence orbitals with the restriction of 2Ag symmetry.

In this way, the number of

conﬁgurations generated for a speciﬁc total symmetry is typically about 17000, though the

ﬁnal dimension of the inner region Hamiltonian is reduced to be about 500 by using CI

target contraction and prototype CI expansion method [34].

In order to obtain the integral cross sections for the electron O2 collisions, the R-

matrix calculations were performed over all 8 irreducible representations of D2h symmetry,

Ag,B2u,B3u,B1g,B1u,B3g,B2g and Au with both doublet and quartet spin multiplicity.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Figure 1 shows the potential energy curves of the O2 target states. These curves were

calculated by the SA-CASSCF method which was used in the actual R-matrix calcula-

tions. Although not included in our R-matrix calculations, we also include the curves for
the O2(21,3Πg) states for reference. Table II compares vertical excitation energies from the

present calculations with previous HF/STO results. Compared to the experimentally es-
timated values, our results are of the same quality for the O2 a1∆g state and are slightly
worse, 0.05 eV, than the HF/STO result for the b1Σ+
ergies are improved by about 0.1 eV for the ‘6 eV states’; c1Σ−

u . For
the higher 3 electronic states, the improvement is about 1 eV. Though discrepancies with
the experimental values are still not small, 0.22 eV for the b1Σ+
g state and 0.45 eV for the
A′3∆u state for examples, we believe that our choice of the GTO basis set and the CAS
space is satisfactory for the present R-matrix calculations considering the diﬀerences with

g state. However, the excitation en-

u , A′3∆u and A3Σ+

the previous HF/STO results.

In ﬁgures 2-5, the cross sections for the transitions from the O2(X 3Σ−

g ) ground state
are shown. These cross sections were previously calculated using the R-matrix method,

but with a diﬀerent basis set and target descriptions [17, 18].

g state with the previous theoretical and
experimental results. The theoretical elastic scattering cross sections are quite similar in

In ﬁgure 2, we compare

shape and magnitude each other. There is a sharp peak around 0.5 eV in each theoretical
cross section, which comes from the O−
2Πg resonance. In our calculation with 13 target
2
states including 4 extra Π targets, this 2Πg resonance is located at 0.196 eV and the width

is 0.00134 eV. When the number of targets are reduced to 9 by removing the Π target

states, the location of the resonance is shifted to 0.548 eV with a width of 0.0161 eV. The

later resonance parameters with 9 target states are closer to the results of the previous

calculations, reﬂecting inclusion of the same number of the target states. When our results

are compared to the experimentally measured elastic cross sections, agreement is good for

energy above 10 eV but is poorer at lower scattering energy below 5 eV. At 1 eV, the

theoretical cross section is about a factor of 2 larger than the experimental results. This

situation mirrors that in the previous R-matrix calculations. As discussed in Noble and

Burke [18], this discrepancy is attributed to lack of long-range polarization eﬀects in our

7

and their model. To improve this low energy behaviour of the elastic cross sections, we

may need pseudostates method of Gillan et al.

[35] and Gorﬁnkiel and Tennyson [36] for

example.

Figures 3 and 4 show excitation cross sections from the O2 X 3Σ−

g state to the a1∆g and
g states. In both ﬁgures, there is a pronounced peak in the cross sections around 8 eV

which comes from the O−

Compared to the previous R-matrix calculations of Noble and Burke [18], our cross sections

with 13 target states are slightly smaller at all scattering energies. The peak height of our
results around 8 eV is 30% smaller in excitation to the a1∆g case and is 35% smaller in
the b1Σ+

g case. However, general feature of the cross section proﬁles are quite similar in
our results and the previous R-matrix calculations. We also compare our results with the

eﬀective range theory (ERT) results of Teillet-Billy et al. [12]. Their method relied on the
existence of the O−
2Πg resonance around 0.2 eV, but did not include the eﬀect of the O−
2
2
2Πu resonance located at 8 eV. Thus, their results and our cross sections agree well at low
energy, below 6 eV, where the 2Πg symmetry mainly contributes to the total cross sections.
However, the agreement is worse at energy range above 7 eV because of the 2Πu resonance
contributions. In both O2(a1∆g) and O2(b1Σ+

g ) cases, agreement with the experimental cross

sections is modestly good in the energy regions away from the resonance peak. As shown in

the ﬁgures 3 and 4, the cross sections of Middleton et al.

[13] have peak in energy region

around 10 eV, which is 2 eV larger than the theoretical position. To resolve this discrepancy,

we need to include the eﬀect of nuclear motion in calculation as discussed in Higgins et al.

[19].

Figure 5 shows excitation cross sections from the O2 X 3Σ−

g state to the ‘6 eV states’.

u , A′3∆u and A3Σ+

These ‘6 eV states’ consist of the O2 c1Σ−

u states. In order to compare
with previous experimental measurements, we sum the cross sections for the transitions to
these states. As in the case of transitions to the a1∆g and b1Σ+
g states in ﬁgures 3 and
4, a prominent peak exists around 8 eV in our results. The cause of this peak is the O−
2
2Πu resonance located at 7.988 eV. Our results are quite similar in shape and magnitude to

the previous R-matrix calculation of Noble and Burke [18], though the cross section peak

at 8 eV is slightly lower in our case. The ERT results of Gauyacq et al.

[37] are also

shown in the ﬁgure. As discussed above, their cross sections do not have a peak around 8
eV because they did not include the O−
2Πu resonance eﬀects. Recently, Green et al.[38]
2

8

measured the integral cross sections from the X 3Σ−

g state to the ‘6 eV states’ and discussed
the discrepancy between the past theoretical results and their measurements. Though the

theoretical cross sections have a peak around 8 eV, the experimental results do not show this

peak nor the enhancement of the cross sections near 8 eV. Figure 5 compares our results

with the experimental cross sections, which shows that the discrepancy still exists below

10 eV. This deviation may come from our use of ﬁxed-bond approximation, because the
equilibrium bond distances of ‘6 eV state’ are longer than those of X 3Σ−
g , a1∆g and b1Σ+
states. In principle, we need to employ the non-adiabatic R-matrix method or vibrational

g

averaging procedure to take into account those diﬀerence of the equilibrium distances. In

this study, we limit ourselves at the ﬁxed-bond approximation and leave the treatment of

nuclear motion for work in future.

g state
elastic cross sections. We do not observe a sharp resonance peak in the a1∆g elastic cross
sections in contrast to the X 3Σ−
2Πg resonance is located 0.7 eV below
the O2 a1∆g state, but 0.2 eV above the O2 X 3Σ−
g state. As shown in the ﬁgure 6, the 2∆g
symmetry is the main contributor to the cross sections at low energy. This indicates that the
l=0 component of the scattering electron is as important as for the X 3Σ−

g elastic scattering.
g state from the a1∆g state is shown in ﬁgure
7. The magnitude of the cross section is about 10 times larger than the corresponding cross
section for excitation from the X 3Σ−
g state to the b1Σ+
g state. At electron collision energy of
7.0 eV, there is a large peak in the cross sections arising from the 2Πu symmetry. The origin
of this peak is the O−

2Πu resonance as in the cross sections from the X 3Σ−

The cross section for excitation to the b1Σ+

g state shown in

ﬁgures 3-5. Because the cross sections are plotted as functions of electron collision energy,

the positions of the peak in ﬁgure 7 and ﬁgure 3-5 are diﬀerent by 0.93 eV which is the energy
diﬀerence of the O2 X 3Σ−
g state and the O2 a1∆g state. Hall and Trajmar experimentally
determined diﬀerential and integral cross sections at 4.5 eV for this excitation [8]. As in

ﬁgure 7, their value and our results agree well. However, we need more experimental data

to make detailed comparisons.

Excitation cross sections to the ‘6 eV states’ from the O2 a1∆g state are plotted in ﬁgure

8. There we show the summed cross sections as well as individual contributions of the O2
c1Σ−

u states. The summed total cross section has a similar shape to the

u ,A′3∆u and A3Σ+

9

excitation cross section from the X 3Σ−
2Πu resonance, as in the case of the a1∆g → b1Σ+

g state. The origin of a peak at 7.0 eV is the O−
g transition. The magnitude of the cross

2

sections at this resonance peak is about 3 times larger than the corresponding cross sections
of the X 3Σ−
g case in ﬁgure 5. The diﬀerence is less pronounced in the energy region above
10 eV where the cross sections from the a1∆g state are about 30% larger than those from
the X 3Σ−

g state.

Figures 9 and 10 show the cross sections for electron collisions with the O2 b1Σ+

g excited
state. The overall features are quite similar to the corresponding cross sections from the
a1∆g state. In particular, the elastic cross sections of the b1Σ+
g state in ﬁgure 9 are almost
the same as those of the a1∆g state shown in ﬁgure 6. Excitation cross sections to the ‘6

eV states’ in ﬁgure 10 are slightly diﬀerent from the excitation cross sections to the ‘6 eV
states’ from the a1∆g state. The height of the cross section peak at 6.5 eV is about 35%
larger than that of the a1∆g case. As in the cases of the X 3Σ−
g → ‘6 eV states’ and a1∆g →
‘6 eV states’ excitations, the O−
2Πu resonance causes this peak in the cross section. The
2

location of the peak in ﬁgure 10 is shifted from the peak positions in ﬁgures 5 and 8 because
of energy diﬀerences between the O2 X 3Σ−

g , a1∆g and b1Σ+

g states.

Finally, we discuss the eﬀect of the extra 11,3Πg,u target states in our R-matrix calcu-
lations. In ﬁgures 2-5, we compare cross sections of electron collisions with the O2 X 3Σ−
g

state from the 9 target states calculations and those from the 13 target states calculations
including 4 extra 11,3Πg,u target states. Inclusion of extra 11,3Πg,u target states generally

lowers the cross sections. However, this lowering is less than 15% and is not signiﬁcant. Our

9 target states cross sections have similar magnitude in general compared to the 9 target-

states R-matrix calculations of Noble and Burke [18]. However, they are slightly diﬀerent
for the excitations to the a1∆g, b1Σ+
eV. In this O−
2

g states and ‘6 eV states’ in the energy region around 8.0
2Πu resonance region, our cross sections are about 20-30% smaller than their

results. These diﬀerences in the cross sections may be attributed to the diﬀerent treatment

of the basis set and the CI representations of the target states in ours and their calculations.

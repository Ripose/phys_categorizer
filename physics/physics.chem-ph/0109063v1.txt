Abstract

Molecular center-of-mass motion is taken into account in the theory of co-

herent control of nuclear spin isomers of molecules. It is shown that infrared

radiation resonant to the molecular rovibrational transition can substantially

enrich nuclear spin isomers and speed up their conversion rate.

I. INTRODUCTION

Symmetrical molecules exist in the form of nuclear spin isomers [1]. Most famous are

the ortho and para isomers of H2. [2]. On the other hand, spin isomers of molecules heavier

than hydrogen are almost unknown. This is because their investigations were not possible

for a long time due to the lack of enrichment methods. Now such methods start to appear

that has advanced the ﬁeld signiﬁcantly (see the review [3]). Yet one needs more eﬃcient

enrichment methods in order to perform investigations of spin isomers of various molecules.

It will also stimulate practical applications of spin isomers.

It was proposed recently to use strong electromagnetic ﬁelds for the spin isomer enrich-

ment. In the ﬁrst version of the method an enrichment is produced by the light-induced

change of molecular level populations [4,5].

In the second method enrichment is due to

combined action of the light-induced level populations change, level energy shift and light-

induced coherences [6,7]. The latter allows to refer to this method as coherent control of

spin isomers.

Analysis of the isomer coherent control [6,7] was performed using simpliﬁed model of

molecules interacting with a strong electromagnetic ﬁeld. Molecules were assumed to be at

rest and have nondegenerate states. The purpose of the present paper is to develop more

general model which will account molecular center-of-mass motion. This can be essential

because the process takes place in the gas phase at room temperature where light-molecular

interaction is known to be aﬀected by the molecular motion.

II. QUALITATIVE PICTURE

Coherent control of spin isomers has been analysed for the case of microwave excitation of

molecular rotational transitions [6] and for infrared excitation of rovibrational transitions [7].

Although each of these two schemes has some advantages we will account molecular motion

only for the case of rovibrational excitation because this scheme allows to achieve larger

enrichment. Note also, that molecular motion is more important for infrared excitation

than for microwave excitation because the latter has smaller Doppler broadening.

Let us start with the qualitative description of the phenomenon. We assume that the

molecules have two nuclear spin states, ortho and para. This is the case, for example, for the

2

CH3F molecules [1,3]. Nuclear spin states are diﬀerent by the symmetry of nuclear spin wave

function of equivalent nuclei in the molecule. Long wavelength electromagnetic radiation

cannot change the nuclear spin state directly. An important point is that the spin conversion

in polyatomic molecules is governed by intramolecular mixing of close (accidentally resonant)

ortho and para states (see Ref. [3] for more details). Interaction of an external radiation

with these particular states can aﬀect the spin conversion.

The level scheme for rovibrational excitation is shown in Fig. 1. Similar to Ref. [7] we

assume that each of the two vibrational states (ground and excited) has one ortho-para level

pair mixed by intramolecular perturbation. The infrared radiation excites the rovibrational

transition m

n of the ortho molecules. By assumption, collisions cannot change spin state

−

of the test molecules directly, i.e., collisional cross-section of ortho-para transitions vanish.

Suppose that the molecule is placed initially in the ortho subspace of the ground vibrational

state. Due to collisions the test molecule will undergo fast rotational relaxation inside the

ortho subspace. This will proceed until the molecule jumps to the state m′, which is mixed
with the para state k′ by the intramolecular perturbation ˆV ′ (see Fig. 1), or to the state

n which is mixed with the para state k by the combined action of the external ﬁeld and
intramolecular perturbation ˆV . Admixture of a para state implies that the next collision

can move the molecule to another para states and thus localize it inside the para subspace.

The spin conversion occurs.

Vibrational relaxation in this enrichment scheme plays an important role. After ortho-

para transition in upper vibrational state the molecule relaxes to the ground vibrational

state. Consequently there is no back conversion through the m

k channel in excited

vibrational state but back conversion occurs through the unperturbed m′

k′ channel. Steady

−

−

state concentrations of the spin isomers is determined by the ortho-to-para conversion rate in

the excited vibrational state and the para-to-ortho conversion rate in the ground vibrational

state. It is essential that conversion through the m

k channel can be substantially enhanced

−

by electromagnetic radiation.

It is clear that molecular center-of-mass motion aﬀects the phenomenon because it makes

the ortho-para mixing in upper vibrational state velocity selective. One obvious eﬀect is that

the radiation does not interact with all molecules in the state n. Molecular motion inﬂuences

also the level energy shift and coherences produced in the molecule by external radiation.

3

One needs quantitative account of these eﬀects in order to understand the real eﬃciency of

the method.

III. RATE EQUATIONS

ˆH = ˆH0 + ¯h ˆG + ¯h ˆV + ¯h ˆV ′.

Quantitative analysis of the problem can be performed with the help of kinetic equation

for the density matrix, ˆρ. The molecular Hamiltonian consists of four terms,

(1)

(2)

(3)

The main part, ˆH0, has the eigen ortho and para states shown in Fig. 1. ¯h ˆG describes

the molecular interactions with the external radiation that will be taken in the form of

monochromatic travelling wave,

ˆG =

(E0

ˆd/¯h) cos(ωLt

kr),

−

−

where E0; ωL and k are the amplitude, frequency and wave vector of the electromagnetic
wave, respectively; ˆd is the operator of the molecular electric dipole moment. ˆV and ˆV ′ are

the intramolecular perturbations that mix the ortho and para states in excited and ground

vibrational states, respectively. These perturbations originate from the nuclear spin-spin, or

spin-rotation interactions [8–11].

In the representation of the eigen states of ˆH0 kinetic equation reads [12],

∂ρ/∂t + v

ρ = S

i[G + V + V′, ρ],

· ∇

−

where S is the collision integral; v is the molecular center-of-mass velocity. We have consid-

ered molecular motion classically in this equation and neglected spontaneous decay which is

slow for molecular rovibrational transitions in comparison with collisional transitions. Ac-

count of molecular motion makes the matrices ρ and S velocity dependent. The matrices

G, V, and V′ remain to be velocity independent.

Kinetic equation for the total concentration of molecules in one spin state, e.g., ortho

can be obtained from Eq. (3),

∂ρo/∂t = 2Re

i(ρmkVkm + ρm′k′V ′

ρo =

Here j indicates the rotational states of the molecule. These sates are assumed to have no

degeneracy. In Eq. (4) a uniform spatial distribution of molecular density has been assumed.

Eq. (4) also because the matrix elements of G oﬀ-diagonal in nuclear spin states vanish.

R

The oﬀ-diagonal matrix elements ρmk and ρm′k′ can be found using the perturbation
theory. We assume further the perturbations ˆV and ˆV ′ being small and consider zeroth-

and ﬁrst-order terms of the density matrix,

Collisions in our system will be described by the model standard in the theory of light-

molecular interaction. The oﬀ-diagonal elements of S have only decay terms,

ρ = ρ(0) + ρ(1).

Sjj′ =

Γρjj′;

j

−

(5)

(6)

The decoherence rates, Γ, were taken equal for all oﬀ-diagonal elements of collision integral.

Relaxation of the oﬀ-diagonal elements of the density matrix is determined in molecular

systems mainly by the level-population decay which is thus assumed to be j-independent.

Note that there are opposite examples, e.g., [13].

The diagonal elements of S can be expressed through the kernel of collision integral, A,

as follows,

Here a = e, g denotes the excited and ground vibrational states, respectively. The nuclear

spin index is omitted in Eq. (7) because there are no collisional ortho-para transitions and

the kernels A for ortho and para states are assumed to be the same. We will consider further

the model of strong collisions with the following collision kernel,

A(α

In Eq. (8) the three relaxation rates were introduced, rotational relaxation (νr) without

change of molecular velocity (velocity persistence eﬀect) and vibrational state; translational

relaxation (νt) that equilibrate also rotational distribution but do not change the vibrational

state; vibrational relaxation (νv) which is accompanied by velocity and rotational relaxations.

The introduction of diﬀerent relaxation rates for diﬀerent degrees of freedom makes the

model of strong collisions more accurate and ﬂexible. It allows to adjust the model to the

particular experimental conditions. Because of its simplicity model of strong collisions is

often used in laser physics, see, e.g., [14,15].

IV. ZEROTH-ORDER THEORY

For the zeroth-order term of the density matrix one has the following kinetic equation,

∂ρ(0)/∂t + v

ρ(0) = S(0)

i[G, ρ(0)].

(11)

Electromagnetic ﬁeld excites only ortho molecules. Consequently, para molecules remain at

equilibrium in the zeroth-order perturbation theory. For the population of para molecules

one has,

Zeroth-order theory for ortho molecules is in fact a familiar phenomenon of light-

molecular interaction. There are numerous publications on this subject including many

textbooks. Our zeroth-order theory is close to the approach [15], although the relaxation

scheme given by Eq. (8) is diﬀerent from [15]. Eqs. (6),(7),(8), and (11) allow to deduce the

system of equations for the stationary populations of ortho molecules,

V. FIRST ORDER THEORY

In zeroth-order perturbation theory, one neglects perturbations ˆV and ˆV ′. It implies that

there are no coherences between ortho and para states, ρ(0)

mk = 0; ρ(0)

m′k′ = 0. Consequently,

one has,

∂ρo/∂t = 2Re

instead of Eq. (4). Thus the spin conversion appears in the second order approximation.

The ﬁrst order correction to the density matrix, ρ(1), is determined by the equation,

conversion rate,

γ′
n = γ′

pop(Ω)w(m′)(τgv + τgt),

is also similar to that in [7] except for the new deﬁnition of relaxation parameters. This

rate enters to the total rate γ in Eq. (26) with minus sign because it is caused by the light-

induced population depletion of the ground vibrational state of ortho molecules. The last

two contributions to γ are more complicated now. The “noncoherent” term appears due to

the level population, ρ(0)

General expressions for the conversion rates are rather diﬃcult to analyse.

Here ρo is the stationary concentration of ortho molecules. Without an external radiation

One can see from this equation that the external ﬁeld produces an enrichment of para isomers

if γ

= γf ree.

We assume in further analysis the following parameters, the Doppler width of the

absorbing transition, kv0 = 30 MHz; ω = 100 MHz, ω′ = 130 MHz, V ′

m′k′ = 5 kHz,
108 s−1/Torr and the Boltzmann factors of the states m′, k′, m, and k all equal

Γ/P = 2

10−2. This set of parameters gives the ﬁeld free conversion rate, γf ree = 10−2 s−1/Torr, which

coincides with the conversion rate in 13CH3F. Nuclear spin conversion in these molecules is

·

governed by quantum relaxation (see the review [3]). The translational, rotational and

vibrational relaxation rates will be taken equal, νt = 0.1Γ, νr = 0.1Γ, and νv = 0.01Γ,

respectively.

Close similarity between noncoherent, γn, and coherent, γcoh, terms (see Eqs. (29) and

(30)) suggests that their contributions to the total rate, γ, are rather diﬃcult to separate.

It is indeed so for a wide range of parameters. On the other hand, at some conditions it is

possible. For example, it can be done for weak external ﬁelds, thus small G. In this case one

has, similar to [7], two peaks in enrichment at frequencies Ω

ω and Ω = 0, see Fig. 2. An

≃ −

obvious diﬀerence is that these two peaks are much wider now having the Doppler width,

kv0. The data shown in this ﬁgure correspond to Vmk = 3 kHz, and Γ = 2 MHz. The peak

at Ω = 0 appears because the excitation probability, p(Ω), has maximum at Ω = 0. This

peak has positive contribution from the rate γn and negative contributions from the rates

γ′
n and γcoh. At high G the main contribution originated from γn reaches the value,

γn

,

which constitutes

15% in our numerical example. The homogeneous width of the peak at

≃

Ω = 0 is equal to ΓB. Consequently, this peak has rather large power broadening. The peak

at Ω = 0 in isomer enrichment was predicted in [4] by considering only the level population

eﬀects.

10

6
The “oﬀ-resonant” peak at Ω

ω appears because the external ﬁeld splits the ortho

≃ −

≃ −

state m into two components and one sublevel crosses the para state k at this frequency of

the external ﬁeld (see Ref. [7] for more details). At low G this peak is determined by γcoh.

When G increases the peak at Ω

ω grows to much bigger values than the peak at Ω = 0.

At high G the main contribution to the Ω

ω peak comes from the rate γn. Position

of this peak is given by

ω[1

G

2/(Γ2 + ω2)], and the homogeneous width is equal to,

The data shown in Fig. 3 correspond to strong optical ﬁeld, G = 50 MHz, and three

values of Vmk. Γ was taken equal 2 MHz. One can see, that strong optical ﬁeld is able to
convert almost all molecules to the para state if Vmk ≃
coupling in upper state produces macroscopic eﬀect, viz., almost complete enrichment of spin

Vm′k′. Thus relatively weak (3 kHz)

isomers. In the case of much weaker coupling in upper state, enrichment is still signiﬁcant.

For example, if the perturbation in upper state, Vmk = 100 Hz, one has the enrichment,

β

1%. Enrichment at this level can easily be measured. The enrichment peak at Ω

≃

is narrow (having almost the Doppler width) and thus can be distinguished from much wider

structures (the width

ΓB) caused by the Ω = 0 peaks.

≃

Conversion rate in the system is equal to γ, see Eq. (31). It is convenient to characterize

it in relative units,

ω

≃ −

(34)

γrel = γ/γf ree −

1.

Thus, γrel = 0 without an external ﬁeld. At low G, conversion rate, like enrichment, has

two peaks in its frequency dependence. If Rabi frequency,

G

, is large and the ortho-para

|

|

couplings in upper and low states have the same order of magnitude, conversion can be

signiﬁcantly enhanced (Fig. 3, upper panel), although this enhancement is smaller than in

the case of the molecules at rest [7]. This enhancement appears because of the crossing

of ortho and para states in upper vibrational state by external ﬁeld. The main diﬀerence

between the present case and Ref. [7] is that the peaks in conversion rate are much wider

now having the Doppler width, kv0.

VII. CONCLUSIONS

We have developed the model of coherent control of nuclear spin isomers taking into

account the molecular center-of-mass motion. This model is more realistic than the model [7]

in which the molecules were assumed to be at rest. It was shown that the main conclusions

of [7] still hold. One has two peaks in the enrichment and conversion rate dependences

on the laser radiation frequency. One can achieve a substantial enrichment and speed up

the conversion rate.

It is also valid that this enrichment scheme can be used to access

very weak perturbations in molecules. On the other hand, molecular motion causes some

decrease in sensitivity of the method. For example, 1% enrichment can be achieved for

the intramolecular perturbation equal V

100 Hz in the present model, in comparison

with 1% enrichment at V

30 Hz in Ref. [7]. This is not a signiﬁcant diﬀerence. But

even this loss in sensitivity can probably be avoided in special excitation scheme, e.g., by

≃

≃

using a multifrequency excitation instead of a monochromatic excitation. This needs further

investigations.

Search of proper resonances will be one of the main diﬃculty in practical implementation

of the proposed enrichment scheme. An existence of the oﬀ-resonance peak in the isomer

enrichment has particular importance. First, one does not need to search for an exact

coincidence of the ortho and para states in upper vibrational state. The energy gap can

be compensated by detuning the laser frequency. Second, the excitation in the oﬀ-resonant

peak does produce even higher enrichment than in the resonant peak but does not produce

signiﬁcant population in upper vibrational state. The latter helps not to populate the

excited vibrational state of other spin isomer and consequently suppress the spurious back

conversion through the upper channel.

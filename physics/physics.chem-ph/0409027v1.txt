Discreteness-induced Stochastic Steady State in Reaction Diﬀusion
Systems: Self-consistent Analysis and Stochastic Simulations

Yuichi Togashi and Kunihiko Kaneko

August 16, 2004

Abstract

A self-consistent equation to derive a discreteness-induced stochastic steady state is presented for reaction-
diﬀusion systems. For this formalism, we use the so-called Kuramoto length, a typical distance over which
a molecule diﬀuses in its lifetime, as was originally introduced to determine if local ﬂuctuations inﬂuence
globally the whole system. We show that this Kuramoto length is also relevant to determine whether the
discreteness of molecules is signiﬁcant or not. If the number of molecules of a certain species within the
Kuramoto length is small and discrete, localization of some other chemicals is brought about, which can
accelerate certain reactions. When this acceleration inﬂuences the concentration of the original molecule
species, it is shown that a novel, stochastic steady state is induced that does not appear in the continuum
limit. A theory to obtain and characterize this state is introduced, based on the self-consistent equation for
chemical concentrations. This stochastic steady state is conﬁrmed by numerical simulations on a certain
reaction model, which agrees well with the theoretical estimation. Formation and coexistence of domains
with diﬀerent stochastic states are also reported, which is maintained by the discreteness. Relevance of our
result to intracellular reactions is brieﬂy discussed.

Introduction

Chemical reaction dynamics are often studied with the use of rate equations for chemical concentrations. For
this approach, the number of molecules is assumed to be large, which validates the continuum description.
However, in a biological system such as a cell, the number of molecules within is sometimes rather small. Then
the validity of continuum description by the rate equations is not evident. This problem of smallness in molecule
number is not restricted in biology. Following recent advances in nanotechnology, reactions in a micro-reactor
are studied experimentally, where the number of molecules in concern is quite small. This is also true in some
surface reaction of absorbed chemicals.

Here we are interested in the eﬀect of such smallness in molecule number. Of course, one straightforward
consequence of the smallness in the number is the large ﬂuctuations in the concentration. Indeed, the ﬂuctuations
around the continuous rate equation can be discussed by stochastic diﬀerential equation [1, 2]. State change by
noise has been studied as noise-induced transitions [3], noise-induced order [4], stochastic resonance [5], and so
forth. The use of stochastic diﬀerential equation, as well as its consequence, has been investigated thoroughly.
If the number of molecules is much smaller and can reach 0, however, another eﬀect of ”smallness” is expected,
that is the discreteness in the number. Our concern in the present paper is a drastic eﬀect induced by such
discreteness in the molecule number.

Previously we have discovered a transition of a chemical state, induced by the discreteness in the molecule
number, i.e., the eﬀect of the number of molecules 0, 1,
[6]. The transition is termed as discreteness-induced
transition (DIT). This transition is not explained by the stochastic diﬀerential equation approach. Rather,
discreteness, in conjunction with the stochastic eﬀect, is essential.
In particular, we studied a system with
autocatalytic reaction in a well stirred container. As the volume of the container decreases and the molecule
number decreases, a transition to a novel state with symmetry breaking occurs, that does not appear either
in the continuous rate equation or in its Langevin version. Here the transition occurs, when the number of
molecule ﬂow from environment to the reactor is discrete, in the sense that it is less than one on the average,
within the average reaction time. Indeed, to the discreteness-induced transition, relevant is not the molecule

number itself but the discreteness in the number of some molecular process (e.g., ﬂow of molecule into the
system) within the average time scale of some other reaction process.

On the other hand, in a spatially extended system with reaction and diﬀusion, the total number of molecules
(and molecular events) increases with the system size, and is not small. Instead, the number of molecules (or
events), not in the total system but within the size of an “eﬀective length”, is relevant to determine the
discreteness eﬀect. Then, we need to answer what this eﬀective length is. In [7], we have proposed that the
so-called Kuramoto length gives an answer to it.

Kuramoto length ℓK is deﬁned as the average length that a molecule diﬀuses within its lifetime, i.e., before
it makes reaction with other molecules [1, 8, 9]. In the seminal papers [8, 9], Kuramoto has shown that whether
the total system size is larger than this length or not provides a condition to guarantee the use of the reaction-
diﬀusion equation. When the system size (length) is smaller than ℓK, local ﬂuctuations rapidly spread over the
system. Contrastingly, if the system size is much larger than ℓK, distant regions ﬂuctuate independently, and
the system is described by local reaction process and diﬀusion, validating the use of reaction-diﬀusion equation.

For example, consider the reaction

A k
−→

X,

′

2X k

−→

B.

If the concentration of chemical A is set to be constant, the chemical X is produced at the constant rate k,
while it decays with the reaction 2X
B at the rate k′. The average concentration of X at the steady state is
kA/2k′, where A is the concentration of the chemical A. Thus the average lifetime of X at the steady

) = 1/√2kk′A. If X molecules diﬀuse at the diﬀusion constant D in
state is estimated to be τ = 1/(2k′

one-dimensional space, the typical length over which an X molecule diﬀuses in its lifetime is estimated to be

X

→

p

ℓK = √2Dτ ,

(1)

which gives the Kuramoto length.

In these works, it is assumed that the average distance between molecules is much smaller than ℓK, and
there is a large number of molecules within the region of the length ℓK. Thus the concentration of the chemical
X can be regarded as a continuous variable. Hence the continuum description is valid. However, if the average
distance between molecules is comparable to or larger than ℓK, local discreteness of molecules may not be
negligible.

For example, consider a chemical species Xj, whose Kuramoto length is given by ℓj. Then we consider
discreteness of molecule species Xi that produces this chemical Xj, i.e., the case that average number of Xi
is less than 1 within the area of the Kuramoto length ℓj. With this setting, molecules Xj, produced by Xi
molecules, will be localized around them, as the average distance between Xi molecules is larger than the
Kuramoto length of Xj. Then, this localization of the chemical may drastically alter the total rate of the
reactions, if reactions with 2nd or higher order of Xj are involved, as will be shown later. In the present paper,
following [7], we pursue the possibility that discreteness of some molecules within Kuramoto length of some
other molecules may drastically change the steady state of the system, as in DIT previously studied.

In section 2, we discuss a general condition for the ampliﬁcation of some reaction by such discreteness. Then
by introducing a self-consistent equation for the rate of this ampliﬁcation, we demonstrate the existence of stable
stochastic steady state (SSS), that never appears in the continuum description. In section 3, we numerically
study a speciﬁc chemical reaction model with three components, to show the validity of this self-consistent
theory for SSS. In section 4, domain formation with this SSS is presented, as a novel possibility for pattern
formation in reaction-diﬀusion system. Discussion is given in section 5, with possible applications to biological
problems.

2 Steady state induced by discreteness of molecule, with ampliﬁca-

tion of some reaction: self-consistent analysis

Consider a reaction system consisting of several molecule species Xm (m = 1, ..., k), with chemical reaction
and diﬀusion. The system can involve catalytic reactions of higher-order catalysis or autocatalysis. Some other
molecules (e.g., resource chemicals) are supplied externally, involved in the reaction among Xm, so that the
nonequilibrium condition is sustained. So far the system in concern is rather general chemical reaction system
with diﬀusion.

2

Now, we take a pair of molecule species, Xi and Xj, where Xj is produced by Xi, and study how the
discreteness of the molecule Xi can alter the steady state from the continuum limit case. To discuss the
discreteness eﬀect, we consider the case that the molecule Xj is localized around the molecule Xi. (Recall the
molecule Xj is produced by Xi.) In order for this localization to work, the average length that the molecule
Xj travels within its lifetime should be smaller than the average distance of the molecules Xi. In other words,
the average number of the molecules Xi within the domain of the Kuramoto length ℓj is less than 1. (see Fig.
1). Here, the lifetime of the molecule Xj is determined by the collision with some other molecule species whose
1, is given independently
density is not low. Hence, the Kuramoto length of the Xj molecule, determined as in
of the concentrations of the molecules Xi and Xj.

§

Now, to alter drastically the steady state by discreteness, the localization of Xj molecule has to change
concentrations of some other molecules, as compared with the case of homogeneous distribution of Xj. This is
possible if there is a higher-order reaction such as mXj + Xq →
Xp, because the probability of such reaction is
ampliﬁed by localization of Xj molecules in space. To compute this acceleration, we calculate the average of cm
j ,
where cj is the concentration of Xj, and compute the degree of ampliﬁcation α from that for the homogeneously
distributed case. In the calculation, we assume that Xj is localized around the Xi molecules, with a width of
ℓj, the Kuramoto Length of Xj (which is shorter than the average distance between Xi molecules).

Assuming that the distribution of Xj is represented by the continuous concentration cj(~x), α can be expressed

as

where V is the size (volume) of the system.

For simplicity, we assume that Xi is randomly distributed over d-dimensional space, and the distribution of
Xj is given by a d-dimensional Gaussian distribution with a standard deviation ℓj around each Xi molecule,
such as

As shown, the reaction can be drastically ampliﬁed as the number of Xi molecules within a volume of the
Kuramoto length (ciℓd

j ) is much smaller than 1.

So far we have shown that for reaction system involving the process from Xi to Xj, the discreteness can
alter the concentration of some chemicals drastically, if (1) the density of Xi molecule is so low that the number

is discrete within the size of the Kuramoto length of Xj molecule and (2) there is a high order (higher than
linear) reaction with regards to Xj.

Next, to conﬁrm that this acceleration of reaction alters the steady state from the continuum case, we need
to check if the condition for the discreteness is sustained under the above ampliﬁcation of concentration of some
chemicals, as a steady state solution. Hence we study some feedback from the concentration of Xp to Xi that
is generated by some reaction path(s). If Xi is produced or catalyzed by Xp, the concentration of Xi depends
on that of Xp, cp. With such feedback, the change of concentration ci is given by some function F (cj, cp), while
the change of the concentration cj depends on ci, and is given by some function as G(ci). Since cp is a function
of α(ci), F (cj, cp) is rewritten as ˆF (cj, α(ci)). Hence the concentrations of Xi and Xj molecules must satisfy

dci/dt = ˆF (cj, α(ci)); dcj/dt = G(ci)

(6)

(F and G may have dependence on other concentrations or reaction rates, e.g., G(ci) can also depend on cj or
α). The steady state solution is obtained by setting the right hand of these equations as 0.

Note that the solution with α = 1 corresponds to the continuum case, given by the standard rate equation.
For some case, this is the only solution for the concentrations. For some other cases, however, there is some
other solution(s) with α > 1. This is a solution with the ampliﬁcation by localization of molecules due to
the discreteness of the Xi molecule. If the concentration of ci obtained from this solution satisﬁes ciℓd
j < 1,
this discreteness-induced solution is self-consistent. Furthermore, the stability of this solution is computed by
linearizing the solution around this ﬁxed point. If this solution is linearly stable, stability of this novel steady
solution is assured, which does not exist in the continuum description (or in its Langevin equation version).
We call the state represented by this solution as stochastic steady state (SSS), as it is sustained stochastically
through discreteness in molecule numbers. We will show an explicit example of this SSS in the next section.

Self-consistent solution involving the change of Kuramoto-length

So far we have assumed that the Kuramoto-length ℓj of the Xj molecule is constant. This is true as long
as the concentration of the molecule relevant to the decomposition or transformation of the Xj molecule is
constant. However, if the concentration of the chemical that is relevant to the determination of ℓj depends on
the concentration of either Xi, Xj, or Xp, the Kuramoto length, as well as α, depends on it. Accordingly, in
eq. (6), we need to regard ℓj in α as a variable that depends on either ci, cj or α. With the inclusion of the
dependence, we again obtain a self-consistent solution, to get the concentrations ci and cj (and accordingly α
and ℓj). If there is a stable solution with α > 1 and ciℓd
j < 1, then we get a SSS as a self-consistent solution
both on α and ℓj. We will discuss a related example in
4, where two solutions with α = 1 and α > 1 coexist
in space, and form a domain structure.

§

Combination of several processes

So far we have discussed a simple case of discreteness-induced state. The discussion with the use of ampliﬁcation
factor α, however, is generalized to include temporally or spatially dependent solutions of ci and cj, with
temporal (or spatial) dependence of α. This solution represents an average behavior longer than the time scale
for stochastic collisions or longer scale than ℓj. With this extension, we can discuss discreteness-induced rhythm
or pattern, that is stochastically sustained.

Such spatiotemporal dynamics can often appear in a reaction network of several molecules, with two or

more pairs of discreteness in number. For example, consider reactions Xi1

Kuramoto lengths of Xj1 and Xj2. Then, following the scheme we discussed, we get a coupled equation for the
concentrations of ci1, cj1, ci2, cj2 with two ampliﬁcation factors α1 and α2. In general, there may be a time-
or space- dependent solution (by including diﬀusion term with much longer spatial scale), that leads to a novel
stochastic pattern or rhythm. Explicit examples for such case will be discussed in future.

To conﬁrm our theoretical estimation for SSS, we have adopted a simple model and carried out stochastic
particle simulations. Here we consider a simple one-dimensional reaction-diﬀusion system with three chemicals

In the continuum limit, each ci(t, x), the concentration of Xi at time t and position x, obeys the following

reaction-diﬀusion equation:

where Di is the diﬀusion constant of Xi. For simplicity, we assume Di = D for all i. This reaction-diﬀusion
equation has homogeneous ﬁxed point solutions with (c1, c2, c3) = (0, 0, c), (√ac/(√a + 1), c/(√a + 1), 0) for all
x. By linear stability analysis, it is straightforward to show that only the former is stable. Starting from any
initial conditions, the partial-diﬀerential equation system simply converges to this stable ﬁxed point.

In this system, the chemical X1 is produced by X2 molecules. (In the notation of

2, i = 2 and j = 1.) If ℓ1,
the Kuramoto length of X1, is shorter than the average distance between X2 molecules, X1 is localized around
the X2 molecules, as discussed in
X1 + X2, which is at second order of X1, is
accelerated. Using eq. (3) in

For any a, b > 1, this Jacobi matrix has two negative eigenvalues, implying that the ﬁxed point is stable1.

In the simulations, we have found that the system converges to the novel ﬁxed point.

In fact, we have
measured c2 at the ﬁxed point for a certain α = a numerically. Figure 4 shows the relation between 1/c2ℓ1 and
α, which agrees rather well with the theoretical estimation in eq. (10).

In summary, we demonstrated numerically that the discreteness of molecules yields a novel stochastic steady

state in a reaction-diﬀusion system, in agreement with the theoretical estimation.

4 Coexistence of Domains with diﬀerent Kuramoto Lengths

In the example of the previous section, the spatial homogeneity is assumed at a coarse-grained level, and indeed,
this homogeneous state was stable. However, due to ﬂuctuations, some spatial inhomogeneity exists in SSS, and
a domain that is deviated from SSS may be produced. Even if this deviated state is unstable in the continuum
limit, it may be preserved over a long time, if the concentration of the molecule to destabilize it is so low that
its discreteness is essential. If the average time to produce this deviated domain from SSS and the lifetime of
the state is balanced, the two regions, SSS and the deviated state with diﬀerent concentrations of molecules
and Kuramoto lengths, may coexist. We give a simple example for it here.

Again we consider the same reactions as the preceding section. Now, we assume that the diﬀusion of X3
is slower than the others, and set (D1, D2, D3) = (100D, 100D, D) (D > 0).
In this model, there are two
ﬁxed-point states: one is the stochastic steady state mentioned above (which we call State A); the other is the
unstable ﬁxed point with c3 = 0 (State B), besides the stable ﬁxed point in the continuum limit (which does
not appear here; see Table 1 for the stability of the states mentioned here). In Fig. 5, we give an example of
snapshot pattern of the model. In the ﬁgure, except several spots with large c3 that corresponds to the state A,
most other regions fall onto the state B that should be unstable in the continuum limit. Indeed, this pattern

possibility that the state B, unstable in the continuum limit, may be sustained over a ﬁnite period due to the
discreteness in molecules, which forms a domain in space. The two states A and B coexist in space and form a
domain structure.

First, we consider stability of each of the states in more detail. The state B is unstable against the inﬂow
of X3. If an X3 molecule enters into a region of state B (Region B), it can be ampliﬁed and form a new region
(spot) of the state A (Region A). From linear stability analysis, we ﬁnd that the degree of instability of the
c2, while in the
region B against the ﬂow of X3 is proportional to (c1
√ac2, and c3 = 0. Here, the concentration c2 is almost uniform in space because of its long

lifetime. Thus, the degree of the instability of the Region A, that is the rate of growth of c3, depends mainly
on the distribution of X1 (see Fig. 6).

Accordingly, the Kuramoto length of X1 is relevant to determine if the state B is invaded or not. Here
it should be noted that in the region A, c1 is smaller than that in the region B. Hence in the vicinity of the
region A within the domain of the state B, c1 is still small, as long as it is within the Kuramoto length of X1
of the region A. Thus the instability is weak there, which prevents a novel region A (X3 spot) growing in the
vicinity of the existing region A. Hence, the interval between two neighboring regions A should be longer than
the Kuramoto length of X1. Assuming that N3

Since X3 can be ampliﬁed by using X1 in the region B, penetration of X3 molecules into the region B must
be rare in order to maintain the region B. The penetration length is given by the Kuramoto length of X3, that

On the other hand, due to the ﬂuctuation inherent in SSS, the molecule X3 may be extinct within some
area of the region A, with some probability. Hence, the regions A and B coexist in space, as shown in Fig. 5.
As shown, the region A is localized only as spots, and other parts are covered by the region B.

Note that in the corresponding reaction-diﬀusion equations, the state A, the stochastic steady state, cannot
be realized, while the state B is unstable. Indeed, the reaction-diﬀusion equation system is quickly homogenized
and converges to the stable ﬁxed point with c1 = c2 = 0. Hence both the regions A and B, as well as a domain
structure from the two, can exist only as a result of the discreteness of molecules, and are immediately destroyed
in the continuum limit.

Note that in the present model, SSS does not have so-called the Turing instability3, and there is no char-
acteristic wavelength. Still the spatial structure here has some characteristic length, as given by the minimal
size of the region B, estimated by the Kuramoto length ℓ1B.
In Fig. 7, we have plotted the spatial power
spectrum of the concentrations of X3. Although there is no clear peak, there is a very broad increase around
the wavenumber of 0.01, that corresponds to average domain size of the region B.

In general, the discreteness of molecules can induce novel states not seen in the continuum limit. For example,
in a randomly connected catalytic reaction network, there often exist several ﬁxed points with some chemicals
going extinct, when the number of molecules is small, while there is only one attractor in the continuum limit.
These discreteness-induced states may coexist in space in a similar way as discussed above. Kuramoto length
will be a useful index to determine the behavior around the border of the regions.

5 Summary and Discussion

In the present paper, we have reported a novel steady state in a system with reaction and diﬀusion, induced by
discreteness in molecules. This state cannot be represented by a continuum description, i.e., partial diﬀerential

2For this reason, we set D3 relatively small. If D3 is larger, the border is blurred and the two regions are mixed.
3It is also possible that the acceleration of reactions by the discreteness induces or enhances the Turing instability in certain

systems.

equation (reaction-diﬀusion equation), but is sustained by ampliﬁcation of some reaction due to localization
of some molecule Xj. This localization is possible if the molecule species that produce Xj is “discrete”, in
the sense that its average number within the Kuramoto length of the Xj molecule is less than 1. We have
formulated a theory to obtain a self-consistent solution for the concentrations of Xi and Xj, in relationship
with the ampliﬁcation rate of the reaction involved with Xj. For some reaction system, there is a solution with
ampliﬁcation rate larger than 1, that leads to the existence of stochastic steady state due to the discreteness in
molecule number. The stability of this solution is also computed within this theoretical formulation.

We have also numerically studied a simple reaction-diﬀusion system to demonstrate the validity of the theory.
Indeed, a novel stochastic steady state is observed, as predicted theoretically. We have also extended our theory
to include the self-consistent determination of the Kuramoto length. Following this extension, we have provided
a numerical example, to show formation of domains with diﬀerent Kuramoto lengths.

The alteration of the steady state by the localization, as well as our formulation for it is quite general.

Provided that the conditions

(i) Chemical Xi generates another chemical species Xj.

(ii) The lifetime of Xj is short or the diﬀusion of Xj is slow so that the Kuramoto length of Xj is much

smaller than the distance between Xi molecules.

(iii) The localization of the molecule Xj accelerates some reactions.

Then, the discreteness can alter the dynamics, from that by the continuum description. The last condition is
satisﬁed if the second or higher order reaction is involved in the species Xj. Finally, if

(iv) the acceleration of the reaction in (iii) alters the density of Xi molecules, through some reaction(s),

the density of Xi is determined self-consistently with the acceleration factor, resulting in a novel steady state.
Note that the localization eﬀect by the discreteness of catalytic molecules itself is also noted by Shnerb et
al.
[10]. In their study, however, the density of the catalyst is ﬁxed as an externally given value. Thus the
concentration of the product, localized around the catalyst, diverges in time. In our theory, the density of the
catalyst (Xi) changes autonomously and reaches a suitable value by following the discreteness eﬀect.

The self-consistent solution scheme to obtain this discreteness-induced stochastic state can be extended to
a case with several components i1, i2, ..., ik, and the corresponding set of chemicals j1, j2, ..., jk satisfying the
conditions (i)–(iii). In such case, the feedback process in (iv) is not necessarily direct from jm to im. If there is
a feedback from the set of chemicals j1, j2, ..., jk to the set i1, i2, ..., ik (condition (iv)′), the above scheme for the
self-consistent dynamics we presented here works. With this extension, there is a variety of possibilities, that
can lead to stochastic rhythm or pattern formation induced by discreteness of molecules, which is not seen in
the continuum limit. For example, in a catalytic reaction network with many components and a limited number
of total molecules, there always exist several species that are minority in number, and the conditions (i)–(ii) are
naturally satisﬁed, while with higher order catalytic reaction the condition (iii) is often satisﬁed. In this case,
minority molecules become a key factor to determine a macroscopic state with rhythm or pattern. (Note in this
case, other molecules can be abundant in number, or indeed it is better to have such abundant species, so that
the stochastic state is stabilized.)

In fact, biochemical reaction networks involve a huge number of species, while the total number of molecules
is not necessarily so large. In a cell, lots of chemicals work at low concentration in the order of 1 nM or less. The
diﬀusion is sometimes restricted, surrounded by macro-molecules, and may be slow. In such an environment, it
is probable that the average distance between the molecules of a given chemical species is much larger than the
Kuramoto lengths of some other chemical species. Some chemicals are localized around some other molecules.
Furthermore, biochemical systems contain various higher order reactions (for example, catalyzed by enzyme
complexes). In conjunction with the localization, such reactions can be accelerated. Hence the conditions (i)–
(iii) are ubiquitously satisﬁed in intra-cellular biochemical reaction networks. In addition, since the biochemical
reactions involve complex feedback process through mutual catalytic networks, the condition (iv) or (iv)′ is
naturally satisﬁed.

Accordingly, it will be important to study the ampliﬁcation of some reaction and its maintenance through
feedback will be relevant to biochemical reactions. Indeed, some molecules that are minority in number some-
times play a key role in biological function. Relevance of minority molecules is also discussed from the viewpoint
on a control mechanism of a cell, in relationship with the kinetic origin of information [11, 12].

The importance of our theory is not restricted to biological problems. Veriﬁcation of our result will be possible
by suitably designing a reaction system, with the use of, say, microreactors or vesicles. The acceleration and
maintenance of some reactions by localization of molecules will be important to design some function in such
micro-reactor systems.

retirement from Kyoto University. With the papers [8, 9] that introduced Kuramoto length a novel research
ﬁeld was opened; the study of chemical wave and turbulence with the use of continuous, deterministic reaction-
diﬀusion equation. It is our pleasure to use his length in the opposite context here, for the description of novel
steady states in discrete, stochastic reaction-diﬀusion systems. The present work is supported by grant-in-aid for

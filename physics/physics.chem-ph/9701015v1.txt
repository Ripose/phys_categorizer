Dimensional perturbation theory for vibration-rotation spectra
of linear triatomic molecules

Abstract

A very eﬃcient large-order perturbation theory is formulated for the nuclear
motion of a linear triatomic molecule. To demonstrate the method, all of the
experimentally observed rotational energies, with values of J almost up to
100, for the ground and ﬁrst excited vibrational states of CO2 and for the
ground vibrational states of N2O and of OCS are calculated. All coupling
between vibration and rotation is included. The perturbation expansions re-
ported here are rapidly convergent. The perturbation parameter is D−1/2,
where D is the dimensionality of space. Increasing D is qualitatively similar
to increasing the angular momentum quantum number J. Therefore, this
approach is especially suited for states with high rotational excitation. The
computational cost of the method scales only as JN 5/3
, where Nv is the size
of the vibrational basis set.

I. INTRODUCTION

The calculation of highly excited rovibrational states of molecules is a challenging com-
putational problem. The traditional method is numerical diagonalization of the Hamiltonian
in a ﬁnite basis set. This works well for low-lying states, but for highly excited states it
is tractable only with judicious choice of basis set [1,2] and the use of special numerical
techniques [3,4,5], on account of the extremely large matrices that are needed in order to
obtain suﬃcient accuracy.

It has been suggested [6] that large-order perturbation theory is a viable alternative ap-
proach to calculating vibrational spectra. We recently compared numerical diagonalization
with large-order perturbation theory in powers of the coupling constant, for a model system
of coupled anharmonic oscillators, and found that the perturbation theory had a signiﬁcantly
lower computational cost [7]. Here we apply dimensional perturbation theory (DPT) to the
calculation of vibration-rotation spectra for actual triatomic molecules. This is a type of
perturbation theory that is especially suited for states with high angular momentum [8].

This theory [9,10,11,12,13] is one example of a class of semiclassical perturbation expan-
sions that have been applied to problems in high-energy physics, statistical mechanics, solid
state physics, and polymer science. There has been much recent interest in using DPT to
solve the electronic Schr¨odinger equation for atoms. At the zeroth order of the perturbation

1

theory an atom becomes a rigid rotor, with the electrons stationary relative to each other.
At ﬁrst order the electrons vibrate harmonically. The ﬁrst-order results for electronic ener-
gies of atoms are typically accurate to within 1% [14], and computational techniques have
now been developed that make it possible to carry the perturbation theory to much higher
order [15,16,17].

Thus far there have been few attempts to apply this theory to molecules, despite the
resemblance between DPT and the standard qualitative picture of molecular vibrations.
First-order expansions have been calculated for the electronic energy of H2 [18], for the
full electronic-vibrational problem (without the Born-Oppenheimer approximation) for H +
2
[19], and for the vibrational motion of atomic clusters [20]. These studies have provided
intriguing qualitative models of correlated many-particle dynamics and semiquantitative
results for energy eigenvalues. Recently, however, Kais and Herschbach [8] used DPT to
compute the rotation spectrum of the ground vibrational state of H2. The accuracy of their
results, from just ﬁrst-order perturbation theory, remained excellent even for J as high as
50.

The distinctive feature of DPT is that it uses a Hamiltonian operator that has been
analytically continued to a nonphysical hyperdimensional coordinate space. Typically, the
kinetic energy operator is generalized to a D-dimensional form while the potential energy is
left unchanged. Since this dimensional continuation is nonphysical, it allows for a great deal
of ﬂexibility in how one chooses to deﬁne it. We will formulate the perturbation theory in
such a way that it closely resembles the Kais-Herschbach diatomic analysis. In Section II we
develop our dimensional continuation of the kinetic energy operator. Section III describes
the method we have used to compute the expansion coeﬃcients. In Section IV we use the
theory to reproduce the empirical rotational spectra for various linear triatomic molecules
and in Section V we discuss advantages of this approach.

II. DIMENSIONAL CONTINUATION OF THE KINETIC ENERGY OPERATOR

DPT is based on the fact that the dynamics of a system of particles simpliﬁes as the
dimensionality becomes very large. This simplication depends on the partitioning of the
coordinates into translational, rotational, and internal degrees of freedom. Consider an
arbitrary system of N particles in D spatial dimensions and let τtrans, τrot, and τint be the
number of coordinates of the indicated type. τtrans and τrot increase linearly with D while τint
quickly reaches a maximum value of N(N
1)/2 and then remains constant with increasing
D. Since the potential energy depends only on the internal coordinates, the energy levels of
the system can in principle be determined from a diﬀerential equation in just τint coordinates
even in the limit D

−

.

The separation of the D translational coordinates is straightforward. Consider a system
of 3 atoms, which we will describe in terms of the center-of-mass vector, rcm; the vector
between atoms 1 and 2, rs; and the vector ra that leads from the center of mass of atoms 1
and 2 to particle 3. If r1, r2 and r3 specify the positions of the atoms relative to the center
of mass, the rs = r2 −

(2.1)

r1 and
ra = r3 −

where ms = m1 + m2. The the kinetic energy operator can be written as

in terms of the mass-normalized coordinates

R cm = m1/2 rcm,
R s = (m1m2/ms)1/2 rs,
R a = (msm3/m)1/2 ra,

where m = m1 + m2 + m3 is the total mass of the system.

The separation of rotational coordinates is more complicated, but is key to the simplying
eﬀect of increasing D. The qualitative eﬀect of separating out angular coordinates is to
introduce a centrifugal potential into the internal-coordinate kinetic energy operator. The
linear increase with D in the number of angular degrees of freedom causes the strength of
the centrifugal potential to increase quadratically with D. The derivatives with respect to
the internal coordinates are overwhelmed by the centrifugal potential in the limit D
.
→ ∞
This elimination of the derivatives yields a Schr¨odinger equation that can be solved exactly
even for many-particle systems.

Consider ﬁrst a diatomic molecule with mass-normalized internuclear distance R s. If we

deﬁne the D-dimensional Laplacian as

where the xi are the Cartesian components of R s, then the Schr¨odinger equation can be
expressed as [21,22]

This is the standard approach to dimensional continuation [23,24] in which the kinetic energy
is deﬁned in a D-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system while the potential energy is
left in its 3-dimensional form (except, perhaps, for certain scale factors [24,25,26]).
It is
straightforward to use Eq. (2.8) to calculate a large-order asymptotic expansion for E in
powers of 1/D or 1/JD [15,16].

For triatomics this analysis is complicated by the fact that the total angular momentum
of the system depends not just on the external rotation coordinates but also on the angle be-
tween R s and R a. Rather than carry out the separation of variables with the D-dimensional
Laplacian, we will use a simpler approach. There are only two considerations that restrict
the way in which the dimensional continuation is deﬁned: The Schr¨odinger equation must
be the correct physical equation for D = 3, and the large-D limit must be a reasonable,
and solvable, zeroth-order approximation for the perturbation theory. Our strategy is to
perform the separation of variables using the 3-dimensional Laplacian and then introduce
an arbitrary D dependence consistent with these considerations. In essence, we will allow
one body-ﬁxed axis to rotate in D dimensions while a second body-ﬁxed axis rotates about
the ﬁrst in a 3-dimensional space.

For the internal coordinates we will use Rs and the cylindrical coordinates ρ and z,

ρ2 + z2 = R2
a,

ρ/z = tan β

(2.10)

where β is the angle between R a and R s. The derivation of the 3-dimensional kinetic energy
operator in these coordinates is given in Appendix A. Let ˆL be the total angular momentum
operator, ˆL1 the operator for the projection of angular momentum onto a space-ﬁxed axis
x1, and ˆK the operator for the projection onto the body-ﬁxed axis R s, and let J, M, and
K be the corresponding quantum numbers. It is convenient to describe the wavefunction in
terms of symmetrized basis functions

φ(±)
J,M,K = 2−1/2 (φJ,M,K ±

φJ,M,−K) ,

(2.11)

where the φJ,M,K(Rs, ρ, z) are simultaneous eigenfunctions of ˆL, ˆLx1, and ˆLs, and K is now
deﬁned to be nonnegative. Let σ be a parity index that indicates the sign in Eq. (2.11).
Then the internal-coordinate part of the kinetic energy operator for given J and M can be
. In Appendix A we
expressed in terms of the matrix elements
derive the following expression:

At order κ2 we have a separable Schr¨odinger equation that can be solved exactly. Our
strategy will be to express the wavefunction at any order in κ in the form of a linear
combination of the separable product eigenfunctions obtained at order κ2.

Note that several of the terms in Eqs. (3.5) and (3.6) are proportional to κ4. We can im-
prove the convergence of our perturbation theory by redeﬁning the dimensional continuation
(diag). The second
so that these terms enter at lower orders [27]. Consider the operator
derivative with respect to r, after the change of variable in Eq. (3.8), becomes proportional
to κ2. We will replace the other factor of κ4 in Eq. (3.6) with κ2/3, taking advantage of
the fact that our Hamiltonian will still be valid as long as it is correct for the physical case
κ = 3−1/2. In Eq. (3.5) we will replace the factors of κ4 with 3−1/2κ3, in order to still have
a separable solution at order κ2.

distinct energy level. Note that ǫ(n,J,K)
does not depend on σ. Higher-order terms will break

this degeneracy, giving rise to the so-called “l-type doubling” [28].

Perturbation equations for the large-order analysis are obtained from the Schr¨odinger

IV. RESULTS

A. CO2

An extensive tabulation of rotational spectral lines for CO2 can be obtained from the
HITRAN data base [30]. We will consider here the ground vibrational state and the ﬁrst
vibrational (nb = 1). Our potential, Eq. (3.1), depends on the 5 parameters ωs, ωb, ωa, Req,
and λ, with zeq = 0. We will use literature values for the 3 frequencies [31] and ﬁt Req and
λ to the empirical spectra.

We use an iterative ﬁtting procedure, adjusting Req to ﬁt the splitting between rotational
levels and λ to ﬁt the splitting between vibrational levels. To obtain initial guesses, we
replace ρ2 in the coupling term in Eq. (3.1) with its diagonal matrix element (2nb+K +1)/ωb,
which yields

Thus, we have independent constants ˜R0,0 and ˜R1,0 that can be directly ﬁt to the nb = 0
and nb = 1 energies for a given J. These results yield initial approximations for Req and λ,
and hence and initial calculation for the energy.

for K = 0 or 1. For CO2, with J chosen as 84, we found that 3 iterations were suﬃcient to
obtain convergence. Our ﬁnal paramter values are listed in Table I.

Figures 1 and 2 report our results for the ground and ﬁrst vibrational states, respectively.
We show the diﬀerence between our calculated energies and energies calculated from a rigid-
rotor approximation using a rotational constant of 0.39 cm−1 [31]. The empirical results [30]
are indicated by circles.

B. N2O and OCS

We consider here only the ground vibrational states of the linear nonsymmetric molecules
N2O and OCS. We set λ = 0 and ﬁt the bond distances R1,3 and R2,3, where the subscript
“3” labels the central atom (N or C), and atom 1 is chosen as N for N2O and O for OCS.
According to Eqs. (2.3), we have

As initial approximations we used the following bond lengths from the literature [32]: R(1)
NN =

CS = 1.561 ˚A. To ﬁt the rotational spectrum we
simply scaled these distances according to Rij = αR(1)
ij and obtained the scale factor from
a one-parameter ﬁt to a arbitrarily chosen rotational level. We obtained αN2O = 1.002 and
αOCS = 1.0256. The resulting values for the Rij, which are listed in Table I, are within the
experimental spread of bond length values. For example, our result for ROC agrees with
the value 1.22 ˚A reported by H¨uckel [33]. Figure 1 compares our calculated energies with
empirical [30] and rigid-rotor [32] results.

V. DISCUSSION

The traditional approach to computing molecular spectra is to numerically diagonalize
the Hamiltonian matrix in a ﬁnite basis set. Our perturbation theory, with an exact recursive
solution at each order, might appear to have little in common with that method. Note,
however, that our theory also expresses the wavefunction as a ﬁnite linear combination of
basis functions, according to Eq. (3.23). Diagonalization uses the variational principle to
determine the best set of coeﬃcients to multiply the basis functions for a given arbitrary
ﬁnite truncation of the inﬁnite basis set. In contrast, our theory yields the unique asymptotic
expansion of the wavefunction [34]. The ﬁnite linear combinations of the basis functions are
exact solutions for the wavefunction components Ψk. Thus, at given order in the perturbation
theory, the asymptotic principle implies a unique choice of basis set. Chang et al. [35],
incidently, have shown that the basis set chosen by a perturbation theory is superior to a
minimum-energy basis set for use in numerical diagonalization calculations of vibrational
spectra.

11

Diagonalization determines the coeﬃcients of the basis expansion that give the “best”
value for the energy. One can expect that the perturbation theory using the same basis
set gives a “worse” result [36]. We have found [7] that it is indeed the case, for a model
vibrational problem, that for a given basis set perturbation theory yields a less accurate
energy than does diagonalization, and we expect this to be true as well for the problems
considered here. However, the computational cost of perturbation theory is much lower.
We show in Appendix B that the cost of calculating the perturbation expansion for a given
eigenvalue of a triatomic molecule scales as N 5/3
, where Nv is the size of the vibrational
basis. In contrast, the standard diagonalization algorithm scales as N 3

v

v [37].

It is of particular interest to consider the eﬀect on cost of the value of J. For variational
calculations the size of the basis set increases linearly with J [2]. Therefore, the cost of
diagonalization scales as J 3. For perturbation theory the total computational cost scales only
linearly with J. Furthermore, the rate of convergence of the perturbation expansion actually
increases slightly with J [27]. Thus, DPT seems to be an especially appropriate method
for computing eigenvalues corresponding to high rotational excitation. Pad´e summation of
the energy expansion at ﬁfth order yields convergence to 7 decimal digits for J = 0 and
8 decimal digits for J = 80. We can easily compute these expansions to 15th order on a
desktop computer workstation, obtaining convergence to more than 12 signiﬁcant ﬁgures.

The relative cost eﬀectiveness of DPT depends on the magnitude of the accuracy loss,
compared to diagonalization, for a given basis set. The accuracy of DPT depends on the
rate of convergence of summation approximants of the perturbation expansion. In contrast
to dimensional expansions for the electronic Schr¨odinger equation [38], the expansions for
the systems considered here are rapidly convergent. A comparison [7] of the cost of ob-
taining a given level of accuracy for vibrational energies of a model 2-coordinate system of
coupled oscillators showed that, in the end, perturbation theory gave much higher accuracy
than diagonalization for a given operation count. We have not carried out diagonalization
calculations for our 3-coordinate systems, so we do not have a detailed comparison of the
methods in this case. The accuracy vs. cost of the 3-coordinate perturbation expansion is
comparable to that of the model system, since the rate of convergence for the model system
is slightly slower but the scaling with Nv is slightly better. Therefore, we expect that our
method is signiﬁcantly more eﬃcient than straightforward diagonalization in this case as
well.

The three molecules treated here are tightly bound and therefore can be accurately
described with harmonic, or nearly harmonic, potentials. The rate of convergence for po-
tential surfaces with larger anharmonicity will undoubtedly be slower. In general one can
expect, from fundamental theoretical considerations [38,39], that dimensional expansions
and coupling-constant expansions for anharmonic oscillators have a radius of convergence
of zero. Coupling-constant expansions calculated by ˇC´ıˇzek et al. [6] for model vibrational
problems with somewhat larger anharmonicity did indeed exhibit only semiconvergent be-
havior, with divergence setting in at higher orders, although the expansions were rapidly
summable with Pad´e approximants. With truly large anharmonicity as in van der Waals
molecules the divergence will undoubtedly be more of a problem. However, there are tech-
niques that could be used to improve the rate of convergence in such cases. For example,
one could redeﬁne the dimensional continuation so that some dependence on J is present
at zeroth order. This would make it possible to include centrifugal distortion in the basis

12

functions. Another useful technique is to modify the potential energy operator so as to
include an arbitrary renormalization parameter, the value of which is chosen to optimize the
convergence [40]. In the context of DPT, this consists of using a dimensional continuation of
the Hamiltonian that has explicit dimension dependence in the potential, giving the correct
potential at D = 3 but increasing the stability of the system at large D [25].

In recent years, methods have been developed [3,5,41,42,43] that lower the cost of di-
agonalization for molecular spectra, especially in the case of ﬂoppy molecules, for which a
harmonic-oscillator basis set converges very slowly. In view of the similarities between the
form of the wavefunction in perturbation theory and in diagonalization, it may be possible to
make analogous improvements in the perturbation theory. In any case, perturbation theory
has the advantage of simplicity and directness, in that a straightforward recursion relation
yields the exact values of the coeﬃcients of the unique asymptotic expansion. Furthermore,
no modiﬁcation of the theory is needed in order to study resonances, in which case quadratic
Pad´e summation of the perturbation expansion yields complex energies [7,44].

Note also that, in contrast to matrix diagonalization, the perturbation theory provides
each eigenvalue with an unambiguous label, in terms of the quantum numbers (n, J, K, σ).
This labeling is analogous to that provided by the vibrational SCF method [45]; however,
that method introduces a separability approximation while the perturbation theory, at least
in principle, will converge to the exact result. In practice, the theory presented here can
break down if the zeroth-order, harmonic, eigenstate is degenerate or nearly degenerate
with another harmonic eigenstate [46]. Such cases can be treated by including additional
dimension dependence in the potential energy so as to break the degeneracy in the large-D
limit, although this procedure results in a somewhat slower rate of convergence.

the cylindrical coordinates deﬁned in Eqs. (2.10).

APPENDIX B: LINEAR ALGEBRAIC FORMULATION OF THE RECURSION

A linear algebraic method for solving perturbation equations was recently presented
by Dunn et al. [16]. This approach is completely equivalent to Eqs. (3.24) and (3.28).
However, it expresses these equations in a transparent form that simpliﬁes the analysis of
computational cost and is particularly convenient for eﬃcient implementation on a computer
[16,49].

The k dependence of the operators H(0)

k,K and H(±)
k,K is quite simple. It is found only in the
operations by the coordinate x, on account of the way in which we deﬁned the dimensional
continuation of the kinetic energy operator. We can take advantage of this to streamline the
form of the recursion relations. Let us deﬁne the operators

2. Computational cost

k

k,j

and B(K ′,σ′)

A close examination of Eq. (B1) reveals that the columns of a(K ′,σ′)

will have one more
nonzero element than will the columns of a(K ′,σ′)
, the west-east rows will have two more
k−1
nonzero elements, and the north-south rows will have three more nonzero elements. There-
fore, the total number of nonzero elements in a(K ′,σ′)
scales with order k as k3. It follows
that the number of multiplications needed at order k in the recursion to compute ǫ1 a(K ′,σ′)
,
or to compute A(K ′,σ′)

using Eqs. (B14), scales as k3.
Consider the cost of evaluating Eq. (B11) for all k such that k

p, where p is the order
at which the energy expansion will be truncated. The most expensive part of the calculation
is the evaluation of the 3 terms that are summed over j. For each value of j there will be
a single matrix operation, scaling at worst as k3, and the sum over j is repeated for each
value of k. Summing the cost over all the values of j and k gives a cost scaling of p5 for
each value of (K ′, σ′). The range of K ′ is 0
J. Therefore, the total cost scales as
≤
Jp5. According to Eq. (3.23), the number of basis functions, Nv, is equal to the number
of nonzero elements of the corresponding tensors. Therefore, Nv scales as p3, and the total
cost scales as JN 5/3

[29] This condition is chosen because it simpliﬁes the form of the perturbation equations.
Note, however, that it implies that the wavefunction Φ(n,J,K,σ) is not normalized to unity.
This must be taken into account if the wavefunction perturbation expansion is to be used

19

directly to compute expectation values of operators. See Ref. [16] for a discussion of this
point.

[36] It does not necessarily have to be the case that the energy calculated with perturbation
theory will be less accurate. Since the perturbation theory is not variational, it is conceiv-
able that with a suﬃciently optimized dimensional continuation the convergence of the
energy expansion would be so rapid that it would give a a value for the energy that is
more accurate than the variational result even for the same basis set.

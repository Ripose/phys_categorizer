I. INTRODUCTION

It is well known that dynamics of a melt of unentangled polymer chains satisﬁes the

Rouse model [1] exceedingly well. For chains which are shorter than an entanglement length

ne, the self-diﬀusion constant and viscosity for a melt of chains of length n are observed

experimentally [2,3] to scale as n−1 and n, respectively, as predicted by the Rouse model.

Computer simulations on simple bead spring models [4] have shown that not only does

the Rouse model predict the correct scaling dependence on chain length n, it also gives

quantitatively correct results. Why this simple model, which was ﬁrst proposed [1] to model

the dynamics of dilute polymer solutions, works so well for a polymer melt remains somewhat

of a mystery.

The crossover from Rouse-like behavior for unentangled short chains to reptation-like

motion for entangled chains has received considerable attention in recent years, while the

crossover from the behavior of very small molecules to the Rouse regime has received rela-

tively little attention. Understanding the latter crossover can provide information on sub-

tleties of the Rouse model and at the same time increase knowledge on the dynamics of a

technologically important class of molecules, normal alkanes. There have been a number

of studies of the dynamics of short alkanes, but to our knowledge there have been no sys-

tematic studies which examine the dependence of either the diﬀusion or viscosity on chain

length. One can also examine the crossover of the mean squared radius of gyration

and end-to-end distance

as a function of n. For Gaussian chains,

where b is the eﬀective bond length. Consider the simple case of normal alkanes, though the

same is true for any ﬂexible chain molecule: for small n, the chains are clearly non-Gaussian

and

. For normal n-alkanes, crossover to Gaussian chain statistics occurs for

n greater than 100 [5,6,7]. Since the Rouse model is based on the fact that the chains are

Gaussian, one would expect that crossover length is a minimum chain length for the Rouse

model to hold, though this has not previously been checked systematically.

2

In the Rouse model, the excluded volume interactions and the hydrodynamic interactions

are disregarded and the polymer is treated as a collection of beads connected with a harmonic

spring with spring constant k = 3kBT /b2. Here T is the temperature and kB is Boltzmann’s

constant. The dynamics of the chain is then modeled with a Langevin equation with a

monomeric friction coeﬃcient ζ. The resulting set of equations can be solved by transforming

to normal coordinates. The resulting self-diﬀusion constant is [8]

The rotational relaxation time τR of a polymer is usually deﬁned by the longest relaxation

time of the end-to-end autocorrelation function

and expressed as [8],

where M is the molecular weight, ρ is the density, and R is the gas constant. This gives

the well known result that for Rouse chains, the viscosity scales linearly with n for constant

monomeric friction coeﬃcient. This simple scaling does not hold at constant temperature

and pressure, since ρ and therefore ζ increase with increasing n. This results in a stronger

dependence on n, namely η

To study the crossover from small molecule behavior to Rouse-like chains, it is convenient

to rewrite the monomeric friction coeﬃcient ζ and viscosity η in several diﬀerent forms. From

eq. 2 for the diﬀusion constant D, we can write

The viscosity can also be written three diﬀerent ways. The ﬁrst, given by eq. 5, we refer to

as ητ . Two additional expressions for η in terms of D, can be obtained by substituting each

form of eq. 4 for τR in eq. 5 and eliminating ζ in favor of D using eq. 2,

These three expressions for both ζ and η are equivalent for Rouse chains, so that any

diﬀerences are a clear signature of deviations from Rouse behavior.

To investigate the crossover to Rouse-like chains with increasing chain length, we car-

ried out a series of equilibrium (EMD) and non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD)

simulations for normal alkanes with 6

observed experimentally for unentangled chains below the entanglement length ne at atmo-

spheric pressure. The EMD simulations were used to calculate both ζ and η as predicted

by the three expressions for each discussed above. The results for η, as predicted by the

EMD calculations, were compared to the viscosity calculated directly from the NEMD sim-

ulations. We also carried out EMD simulations on alkanes in this size range employing three

diﬀerent interaction models discussed recently in the literature. These were performed at

experimental density for atmospheric pressure and the diﬀusion constant D as a function

of chain length was compared to experiment. All sets of EMD simulations were used to

study the behavior of the equilibrium structural statistics

carried out simulations using the rotational isomeric state (RIS) model for chains in the

range 34

In Sec. II we summarize the simulation models and the methodology used. The equi-

librium results for the static structural properties and their behavior with increasing n are

presented in Sec. III. Results for the dynamics are presented in Sec. IV where we discuss the

crossover for the monomeric friction coeﬃcient and viscosity as a function of chain length

n and compare diﬀusion results to experiment and predictions based on the Rouse model.

We brieﬂy summarize our main conclusions in Sec. V.

II. SIMULATION MODEL AND METHOLOGY

In order to study a wide range of chain lengths, an united atom (UA) model was used to

simulate the linear alkanes. In this model, the hydrogen atoms are not explicitly simulated.

Rather, they are grouped with the carbon to which they are bonded into a single particle

or a united atom. We do, however, distinguish between diﬀerent CHn groups. These groups

or united atoms interact through bonded and non-bonded forces. The bonded interactions

are represented by constraint forces which keep intramolecular nearest-neighbors at a ﬁxed

distance, a bending term

where θb is the equilibrium angle between successive bonds, and a torsional term

characterizing preferred orientations and rotational barriers around all non-terminal bonds.

The non-bonded forces are described by Lennard-Jones (LJ) interaction sites located at the

position of each carbon atom center of mass. The LJ potential is deﬁned by

This non-bonded interaction is between both intermolecular and intramolecular sites except

for those which are separated by less than four bonds and which therefore interact through

one or more of the bonded interaction terms. The LJ interaction is usually truncated at a

distance rc and the potential shifted so that VLJ (rc) = 0.

In our earlier studies of the diﬀusion [10,11] and viscosity [12] of linear and branched

alkanes, we studied two models for the interactions. The ﬁrst was the symmetric UA model of

Siepmann et al. [13,14] which was developed to describe the vapor-liquid coexistence curves

of the n-alkane phase diagram [15]. We refer to this as model A. The second, which we

denote as model B, was the asymmetric united atom (AUA) model of Padilla and Toxvaerd

[16,17] which was optimized to describe the static and dynamic behavior of short n-alkanes

(5

n

≤

≤

10) at moderately high temperatures and pressures. In this latter model, there is a

displacement between the centers of force of non-bonded interactions and the centers of mass

of the united atoms, hence the name. Paul et al. [18] recently introduced a new, optimized

symmetric UA model which they claimed was better able to reproduce the properties of

melts of linear normal alkanes. The primary diﬀerences between their model and that of

Siepmann et al. [13,14] was the use of a slightly larger σ and a diﬀerent torsional potential;

we refer to our implementation of this last parameterization as model C [19].

The intramolecular interaction parameters for the three models are listed in Table I.

The parameters for the torsional potential of model A are from Jorgensen et al. [20]. Paul

et al. [18] presented results for two torsional potentials. The ﬁrst one they studied gave

a diﬀusion constant which was 45% larger than the experimental result for n

C44H90 at

−

T = 400 K. They subsequently modiﬁed the torsional potential Vt(φ) to increase the trans-

gauche barrier from 3.0 to 3.3 kcal/mol. Since this latter model gave a better estimate of the

D, though still 30% too large for n

C44H90, we used their modiﬁed version of Vt(φ) here.

−

For comparison, the torsional potentials for the three models are shown in Fig. 1. Note that

the gauche energy is about the same for models B and C (0.5 kcal/mol) and about half that

of model A (0.9 kcal/mol). This diﬀerence will inﬂuence the thermodynamic ﬂexibility of

the molecules and the persistence length for long chains. Models B and C are expected to

6

result in more thermodynamically ﬂexible molecules than model A. The dynamic ﬂexibility

is related to the size of the trans-gauche barrier, which is larger for model B than for models

A and C. Thus, models A and C lead to more dynamically ﬂexible molecules than model B.

The Lennard-Jones parameters are listed in Table II for all three models. Note that the

interaction strength ǫ is the same for models A and C. The eﬀective diameter for the united

atoms is diﬀerent for the three models, with model C having a larger eﬀective diameter than

model A. For model B, a direct comparison based on the value of σ is not appropriate due

to the asymmetric nature of united atoms. While the σ for model B is the smallest, the

displacement between the center of force of non-bonded interactions and the center of mass

of the united atom, results in an eﬀectively larger united atom than represented by σ. The

interaction parameter between a CH3 and CH2 site is given by the Lorenz-Bertholot rule,

√ǫCH3ǫCH2. We used a 10 ˚A cutoﬀ for the (shifted) LJ potential.

All of the MD results presented here were obtained from constant volume, constant

temperature simulations. The velocity rescaling algorithm of Berendsen et al. [21] was used

to control the temperature in the EMD simulations while the Nose-Hoover [22] algorithm was

used for the NEMD simulations. The equations of motion were integrated using the velocity

Verlet algorithm [22] with a 5 fs time step for both the EMD and NEMD simulations. Bond

lengths were kept constant using the RATTLE algorithm [22,23]. Equilibrium structural

statistics, the self-diﬀusion constant D, and rotational diﬀusion time τR were determined

from EMD simulations while the viscosity η was determined from NEMD simulations. The

NEMD results reported here were obtained in the Newtonian regime, for a shear rate ˙γ =

8.70

×

10−4 ps−1, which satisﬁes ˙γ < τ −1

R for all n studied.

One set of EMD simulations was done at constant density for a series of chain lengths

n. The density used was the bulk density for high molecular weight polyethylene, ρ =

0.766 g/cm

[9] and the simulations were carried out at (T = 448 K). Selected chain lengths

3

at this state point were also studied with NEMD simulations. For small n, this state point

corresponds to a high pressure state.

In all of the constant density simulations (EMD

and NEMD), interaction model A alone was employed. Another set of EMD simulations

7

were performed using the experimental densities at atmospheric pressure (P

0.1 MPa)

≃

for four chain lengths n. For each of these chain lengths, simulations were run using all

three interaction models A, B, and C. These experimental density simulations were run

at T = 400 K in order to remain far below the vapor-liquid critical temperature Tc for

small n, which for example is 507 K for n-hexane and 617.5 K for n-decane [24]. Since we

were interested in studying the eﬀect of chain length on diﬀusion and viscosity, we chose

temperatures which were higher than the melting temperature Tm for large n. For linear

polyethylene, Tm ≃

To examine equilibrium structural statistics for n > 66, we used a continuum version of

the RIS model for chains up to length n = 2000. There have been several studies [5,6,7,25,26]

which have shown that by proper choice of the cutoﬀ for the non-bonded interactions, the

radius of gyration and end-to-end distance of an isolated chain compare very favorably

with that of the melt. Here we followed the standard RIS model for polyethylene, which

includes all bonded interactions and the 1-5 intramolecular Lennard-Jones potential (these

are the “second-order interactions” of RIS theory and are known to be essential in order

to reproduce the experimental characteristic ratio of the polyethylene chain). The main

diﬀerence between the present model and the standard RIS model is that in the present

implementation the molecule can explore the entire torsional potential surface, rather than

being conﬁned to a set of its minima. To allow comparison with the constant density EMD

simulations, the simulations were done at T = 448 K. For short chains (n <
∼

100), one can

use Langevin dynamics simulations in which each isolated chain is coupled weakly to a heat

bath. However for large n, the pivot algorithm [27] is considerably more eﬃcient. Most of

the results for the RIS simulation were obtained using the pivot algorithm, though for small

n both methods gave comparable results as expected.

this curve one can form an approximation of the chain length needed to reach Gaussian

for a ﬂexible chain consisting of beads connected with a spring [4] but with no torsional or

through the parameters of the torsional potential. As discussed in Sec. II, the torsional

potential for model A has a larger gauche bond energy than that used in models B and

C (about 0.4 kcal/mol larger). This generally means that models B and C result in more

thermodynamically ﬂexible, and therefore more compact, molecules than model A. Data in

diﬀerent parameters. Furthermore, their largest diﬀerence in parameters, for this study of

equilibrium properties, is found in their torsional potentials. Thus the eﬀect on molecular

size can be directly attributed to the diﬀerence in gauche bond energy. Comparing

i
data for models B and C, we note that the diﬀerence in molecular size for the two models

h

R2

is larger than what one would expect due simply to the slight diﬀerence in the gauche bond

energy. This is sensible since model B represents a fundamentally diﬀerent parameterization

of the united atom model than models A and C. This indicates that torsional potentials are

not directly transferable between UA and AUA models. From observation of the data in

Table IV, we anticipate that the crossover to Gaussian structural statistics with increasing

n will occur ﬁrst for model B, then for model C, and last for model A; Fig. 2b gives evidence

of this. This ﬁgure is the same as Fig. 2a but with data from the EMD simulations using the

three models at T = 400 K and experimental density at atmospheric pressure. While Fig. 2b

shows only the beginning of the crossover, the ranking predicted is evident at this stage.

The RIS simulations for the three models conﬁrm the order of the crossover to Gaussian

statistics.

A and B, respectively. These results are not presented to further evaluate the two models so

much as to demonstrate that there is a very slow convergence of molecular sizes for models A

and B with increasing temperature. In this respect, note that the average radius of gyration

of n-hexadecane using model A at T = 400 K is still larger than the value for model B at

298 K [10]. While temperature can inﬂuence the position in n of the crossover to Gaussian

statistics, these observations show that the model used has a much greater inﬂuence than

temperature.

Boothroyd et al. [28] have reported on experimental data for the radius of gyration of

a polyethylene chain in a melt. Speciﬁcally, they quote the radius of gyration for samples

IV. DIFFUSION AND VISCOSITY RESULTS

Results for the self-diﬀusion constant D, the rotational diﬀusion time τR and the shear

viscosity η are collected in Tables III and IV for all simulations performed. The self-diﬀusion

constant is obtained from the slope of the mean-squared displacement of the molecular

center of mass, averaged over all the molecules (Nmol) in the system and all available initial

times. In taking the average, the sum of the mean-squared displacements for the Nmol is

divided by Nmol

1 to account for the fact that the center of mass of the system does

−

not move. To calculate τR, we consider the ﬁrst-order angular correlation of the longest

principal axis of a molecule’s ellipsoid of inertia [10]. At intermediate times, this correlation

is well described by a simple exponential relaxation with a time constant τR as shown

11

in Fig. 4 for n-tetracosane and n-hexahexacontane. Equivalently, one can measure the

autocorrelation function

for the end-to-end distance [18] and ﬁt this curve with

R(t)

·

R(0)

the corresponding formula from the Rouse model [8] to obtain a measure of τR. Both of

these correlations can be calculated from EMD. The viscosity was determined directly from

NEMD simulations. From our previous study [12] comparing EMD and NEMD simulation

methods for determining the viscosity of n-alkanes, the NEMD simulation technique requires

about half the cpu time required by EMD methods for comparable accuracy. For further

details see ref. [12].

The diﬀusion constants for the three models studied are compared to experimental data

[29] for T = 400 K in Fig. 5. These simulations were run at the experimental densities listed

in Table IV for P = 0.1 MPa. Note that for all of the simulation results as well as the

experiments, the product Dn decreases with increasing n. This decrease is due to the fact

that the density and therefore the monomeric friction coeﬃcient ζ increases with increasing

n, causing D at ﬁxed T to decrease faster than predicted by the Rouse model. Assuming

that the change in Dn is due to change in the monomeric friction coeﬃcient a ﬁt to the data

n−0.8. One also sees from Fig. 5 and Table IV that model A overestimates D by

50%, while models B and C ﬁt the available experimental data quite well.

Similar results for models A and B were found in our earlier studies [10,11,12] for n-decane,

n-hexadecane, and n-tetracosane as well as for several branched alkanes. What is new in the

current results is the agreement with experiment found for model C which is a symmetric

united atom model. A symmetric united atom model is somewhat less computationally

demanding to implement than an asymmetric united atom model. For identical length

simulations we ﬁnd that for 100 molecules of n = 44, the symmetric UA model requires

gives ζ

approximately 15

−

approximately 10% less cpu time than the AUA model.

The three estimates of ζ are shown in Fig. 6 for constant density and T = 448 K. Note

that ζD determined from the diﬀusion constant is only weakly dependent on n and even very

small chain lengths give a reasonably good estimate of the friction coeﬃcient of unentangled,

Rouse-like chains. The change in ζD from n = 10 to 66 is only 10%. The signiﬁcant change

12

in ζ with n at constant pressure as exhibited by the diﬀusion data discussed above all but

disappears at constant density. This is in contrast with ζτ which depends much more strongly

on n for small n; furthermore, ζτ > ζD [18]. The diﬀerence between ζτ (RG) and ζτ (R) for

small n is another representation of the deviation of equilibrium structural statistics from

Rouse-like behavior. For n >

statistical uncertainties as predicted by the Rouse model.

60, all three methods of determining ζ agree within our

Another attribute of Fig. 6 warrants discussion. At small n, ζD decreases with increasing

n and appears to reach a minimum around n = 24. This behavior is caused by an end

eﬀect: at small n, there is a large concentration of CH3 united atoms whose Lennard-Jones

ǫ parameter in model A is over twice that for CH2 united atoms. An increase in ǫ is known

to decrease diﬀusion [10] thereby eﬀectively increasing ζD. To verify that this end eﬀect

caused the increase in ζD, the state points for n = 6, 16, and 24 were simulated but with the

ǫ = 0.93 kcal/mol for all the united atoms (i.e. the value for CH2 in Model A). The mass of

all united atom groups was that of CH2 so the volumes were adjusted to achieve the stated

density. The results for ζD are shown on Fig. 6 as ﬁlled symbols. The change in value at

n = 24 is very small (4%) demonstrating that the end eﬀect is nearly undetectable for large

n as expected. The overall variation in ζD is now also smaller. From the three data points

presented, it can be seen that the minimum in ζD with n still exists, however the minimum

has shifted to n = 16, coincident with the position of the maximum in

(Fig. 2a). This

suggests that the origin of the minimum of ζd in Fig. 6 is related to the chain ﬂexibility.

Finally, the three estimates for the viscosity are compared to our results from NEMD

simulations in Fig. 7. As observed in our previous study [12], ητ gives a very good estimate

(within about 20%) for all n, while ηD is signiﬁcantly smaller for small n. Since τR requires

approximately ten times less cpu time to determine than η, we believe that at least for

unentangled chains, τR is an eﬃcient way to predict η without having to measure η directly.

60, all the estimates of η and the NEMD calculation agree within our statistical

density, the Rouse model was used to extract the monomeric friction coeﬃcient ζ and the

viscosity η independently from the diﬀusion constant D and the longest relaxation time τR.

ζD extracted from D was nearly independent of chain length while ζτ obtained from τR was

much larger than ζD for small n. The viscosity measured in a non-equilibrium molecular

dynamics simulation was closely approximated by the value of η determined from τR while

the η inferred from D is smaller for small n. For n >
∼

60, the two estimates for both ζ

and η agree as predicted from the Rouse model. Diﬀusion at normal pressure as calculated

from three interaction models was studied for increasing n and the results were compared to

experimental data. Very good agreement with experiment was found for two of the models

while the third consistently overestimated D. For all models and experimental data, D was

found to depend more strongly on n than predicted by Rouse theory.

computed. Nath et al. propose a slightly set of diﬀerent parameters for the non-bonded

Lennard-Jones interactions in model A to correct for this error. In this revised model, the

CH3 united atoms for butane and longer n-alkanes are roughly 1% smaller than in model

A and ǫCH3 and ǫCH2 are roughly 10% and 2% smaller than in model A, respectively. While

these diﬀerences have an eﬀect on the liquid-gas phase diagram for small n, they are not

large enough to make a signiﬁcant change in the self-diﬀusion constant and viscosity.

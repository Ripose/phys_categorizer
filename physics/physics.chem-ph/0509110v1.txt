Abstract

Recent studies of the hydration of micro- and nanoscale solutes have demonstrated a strong

coupling between hydrophobic, dispersion and electrostatic contributions, a fact not accounted for

in current implicit solvent models. We present a theoretical formalism which accounts for coupling

by minimizing the Gibbs free energy with respect to a solvent volume exclusion function. The

solvent accessible surface is output of our theory. Our method is illustrated with the hydration

of alkane-assembled solutes on diﬀerent length scales, and captures the strong sensitivity to the

particular form of the solute-solvent interactions in agreement with recent computer simulations.

Much progress has been made in the last decade in the understanding of hydrophobic sol-

vation on diﬀerent length scales [1, 2]. Most of this work has been devoted to study solvation

of purely repulsive, hard sphere-like solutes, while less attention has been given to the inﬂu-

ence and incorporation of dispersion or electrostatic contributions. Likewise, an entire ﬁeld

in the biophysical community has explored electrostatic solvation eﬀects in the absence or

uncoupled addition to hydrophobic considerations [3]. Recently, however, several computer

simulations have demonstrated a strong coupling between hydrophobicity, solute-solvent dis-

persion attractions, and electrostatics. For example, a simulation of explicit water between

paraﬃn plates revealed that hydrophobic attraction and dewetting phenomena are strongly

sensitive to the nature of solute-solvent dispersion interactions [4]. Similarly, simulations

of hydrophobic channels [5, 6] and nanosolutes [7] have shown that charged solutes, which

attract the dipolar solvent due to increasing electric ﬁeld strength close to the solute surface,

strongly aﬀect the dewetting behavior and potentials of mean force (pmf). A fully atomistic

simulation of the folding of the two-domain protein BphC enzyme [8] further supported

coupling by showing that the region between the two domains was completely dewetted

when solvent-solute van der Waals (vdW) and electrostatic interactions were turned oﬀ, but

accommodated 30% of the density of bulk water with the addition of vdW attractions, and

85-90% with the addition of electrostatics, in accord with experimental results. Finally, Liu

et al. recently observed a dewetting transition in the collapse of the melittin tetramer which

was strongly sensitive to the type and location of the hydrophobic residues proving that

these observations apply to realistic biomolecular systems [9].

In this letter we propose a continuum description of solvation that explicitly couples

hydrophobic, dispersion and electrostatic contributions. Similar to the approach of Parker

et al. in their study of bubble formation at hydrophobic surfaces [10], we express the Gibbs

free energy as a functional of the solute cavity shape, the latter given by the volume exclusion

function of the solvent, and obtain the optimal shape by minimization. This leads to an

expression similar to the Laplace-Young equation for the geometrical description of capillary

surfaces [11], but in contrast to existing approaches explicitly includes the inhomogeneous

distributions of dispersion and electrostatic contributions as well as curvature corrections.

Geometry-based approaches similar to our formalism exist in related ﬁelds, such as the

Helfrich description of membranes shapes [11], wetting in colloids and granular media [11],

and electrowetting [12]. We stress that, as opposed to other implicit solvent models [3],

the solvent accessible surface (SAS) is an output of our theory. This surface encloses the

optimal solvent accessible volume and should not be confused with the canonical SAS [3]

which is simply the union of probe-inﬂated spheres. We begin by verifying that our method

is able to describe the solvation of small alkanes on molecular scales. We then demonstrate

that it captures the strong sensitivity of dewetting and hydrophobic hydration to solute-

solvent interactions on larger scales for a model system of two alkane-assembled spheres.

In this striking example the strong hydrophobic attraction decreases almost two orders of

magnitude in units of the thermal energy, kBT , and dewetting is partially or completely

suppressed when realistic dispersion and electrostatic contributions are included. We expect

our approach to be particularly useful in solvation studies of proteins where the hydrophobic

surfaces are highly irregular and laced with hydrophilic units, and a uniﬁed description of

hydration on diﬀerent length scales is important [1, 9, 13].

Let us consider an assembly of solutes with arbitrary shape and composition surrounded

by a dielectric solvent in a macroscopic volume

. We deﬁne a subvolume

empty of solvent

W

V

for which we can assign a volume exclusion function in space given by v(~r) = 0 for r

∈ V
and v(~r) = 1 elsewhere. We assume that the surface bounding the volume is continuous and

v(~r) via V [v] =

closed. The absolute volume V and surface S of

can then be expressed as functionals of
∇ ≡ ∇~r is the usual
gradient operator. The density distribution of the solvent is given by ρ(v(~r)) = ρ0v(~r),

We suggest expressing the Gibbs free energy G[v] of the system as a functional of v(~r)

and obtaining the optimal volume and surface via minimization δG[v]/δv[~r] = 0. We adopt

the following ansatz for the Gibbs free energy:

(1)

The ﬁrst term in (1) is the energy of creating a cavity in the solvent against the diﬀerence
in bulk pressure between the liquid and vapor, P = Pl −
the energetic cost due to solvent rearrangement close to the cavity surface in terms of a

Pv. The second term describes

coeﬃcient γ. This interfacial energy penalty is thought to be the main driving force for

hydrophobic phenomena [1]. The coeﬃcient γ is not only a solvent speciﬁc quantity but also

depends on the local topology of the surface [13], i.e., it is a function of the volume exclusion

function, γ = γ(v(~r)). The exact form of this function is not known. For planar macroscopic

solvent-cavity interfaces γ is usually identiﬁed by the liquid-vapor surface tension, γlv, of

the solvent, which we will also employ here.

In the following we make a local curvature

approximation, i.e. we assume that γ can be expressed solely as a function of the local mean

curvature of the interface deﬁned by v, γ(v(~r)) = γ(H(~r)), with H(~r) = (κ1(~r) + κ2(~r))/2,

where κ1 and κ2 are the two principal curvatures. We then apply the ﬁrst order curvature

correction to γ given by scaled-particle theory [14], the commonly used ansatz to study the

solvation of hard spheres, arriving at

γ(H(~r)) = γlv(1 + 2δH(~r)),

(2)

where δ is a constant and positive length expected to be of the order of the solvent particle

size [14]. The curvature is positive or negative for concave or convex surfaces, respectively.

Note that this leads to an increased surface tension for concave surfaces, in agreement

with the arguments of Nicholls et al. [15] in their study of alkanes. It has been shown by

simulations that (2) predicts the interfacial energy of growing a spherical cavity in water
rather well for radii & 3˚A [16].

The third term in (1) is the total energy of the non-electrostatic solute-solvent interaction

given a density distribution ρ(v). The energy U(~r) =

i Ui(~r) is the sum of the short-ranged
repulsive and long-ranged (attractive) dispersion interactions Ui between each solute atom

P

i and a solvent molecule. Classical solvation studies typically represent Ui as an isotropic
(σ/r)6], with an energy scale ǫ and a
Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential, ULJ(r) = 4ǫ[(σ/r)12

−

length scale σ. The importance of treating dispersion interactions independently as opposed

to absorbing them in to the surface tension term, has been emphasized by Gallicchio et al.

in their study of cyclic alkanes [17].

The fourth term in (1) describes the total energy of the electrostatic ﬁeld expressed by

the local electrostatic potential Ψ(v(~r)) and the position-dependent dielectric constant ǫ(~r)

assuming linear response of the dielectric solvent.

In general, the electrostatic potential

Ψ can be evaluated by Poisson’s equation,

[ǫ(~r)

Ψ(~r)] =

λ(~r)/ǫ0, where λ(~r) is the

∇ ·
solute’s charge density distribution. The most common form for the dielectric function, ǫ(~r),

∇

is proportional to the volume exclusion function v(~r) [3]

ǫ(v(~r)) = ǫv + v(~r)(ǫl −

ǫv),

where ǫv and ǫl are the dielectric constants inside and outside the volume

, respectively.

(4)

Eq. (4) is an ordinary second order diﬀerential equation for the optimal solvent accessible

volume and surface expressed in terms of pressure, surface curvatures, dispersion interac-

tions, and electrostatics, all of which have dimensions of force per surface area or energy

density. K(~r) = κ1(~r)κ2(~r) is the Gaussian curvature and follows from the variation of

the surface integral over H(~r) in (1). Thus, in our approach the geometry of the surface,

expressed by H and K, is directly related to the inhomogeneous dispersion and electrostatic

energy contributions. Note that the SAS is presently deﬁned with respect to the LJ centers

of the solvent molecules.

In the following we illustrate solutions of (4) in spherical and cylindrical symmetries.

For a spherical solute (4) reduces to a function of R, the radius of the solvent accessible
1/R and K = 1/R2. In cylindrical symmetry the SAS can be expressed by

sphere, H =

−

−

a one dimensional shape function r(z), where z is the coordinate on the symmetry axis in

z-direction and r the radial distance to it. The three-dimensional surface is obtained by

revolving r(z) around the symmetry axis. We express r = r(t) and z = z(t) as functions
z′/(r√r′2 + z′2) and
z′′r′)/((r′2 + z′2)3/2), where the primes indicate the partial derivative with

of the parameter t. The principal curvatures are then given by κ1 =
κ2 = (z′r′′

−

respect to t. We solve (4) and Poisson’s equation numerically, using standard forward time

relaxation schemes.

We now study the solvation of methane and ethane in water and compare our results

to the SPC explicit water simulations by Ashbaugh et al.

[18], in which the alkanes are

modeled by neutral LJ spheres. The LJ water-atom parameters are ǫ = 0.8941kJ/mol
and σ = 3.45˚A for CH4, and ǫ = 0.7503kJ/mol and σ = 3.47˚A for CH3, and the bond
length of ethane is 1.53˚A. We ﬁx the liquid-vapor surface tension for SPC water at 300K
to γlv = 65mJ/m2 [16]. Since we deal with water under ambient conditions the pressure

term can be neglected and the length δ remains the only free parameter. For methane
we can reproduce the simulation solvation energy with a ﬁt δ = 0.85˚A. This is in good
0.05˚A for SPC water. Solving

agreement with Huang et al. [16] who measured δ = 0.76

±

the cylindrically symmetric problem for the diatomic ethane with the same δ = 0.85˚A, we

obtain a ﬁt-parameter-free G = 11.48kJ/mol, which is only 7% larger than the simulation
results. Alternatively, the best ﬁt δ = 0.87˚A reproduces the simulation energy exactly. This

is surprisingly good agreement given the crude curvature correction we apply and the fact

that the large curvature of the system varies locally in space. This supports the validity

of our continuum approach down to a molecular scale. The curvature and shape functions

H(z), K(z), and r(z) are plotted in Fig. 1 together with the vdW surface and the canonical
SAS obtained from rolling a probe sphere with a typically chosen radius rp = 1.4˚A over the

resulting from our theory is smaller than the canonical SAS, and is smooth at the center

of mass (z = 0) where the canonical SAS has a kink. Thus our surface has a smaller mean

curvature at z = 0 and an almost zero Gaussian curvature, which is typical for a cylinder

geometry for which one of the principal curvatures is zero. These results may justify the

use of smooth surfaces in coarse-grained models of closely-packed hydrocarbon surfaces, a

possibility we will now explore with solvation on larger length scales where dewetting eﬀects

can occur.

Let us consider two spherical solutes which we assume to be homogeneously assembled
of CH2 groups with a uniform density ρ=0.024˚A−3 up to a radius R0 = 15˚A, deﬁned by

the maximal distance between a CH2 center and the center of the solute. The CH2-water
LJ parameters are ǫ = 0.5665kJ/mol and σ = 3.536˚A. Similar ones have been used by

Huang et al. [4] to study dewetting between paraﬃn plates. The integration of the CH2-

water LJ interaction over the volume of a sphere leads yields a 9-3 like potential for the

interaction between the center of the paraﬃn sphere and a water molecule [19]. The intrinsic,

nonelectrostatic solute-solute interaction Uss(s) can be obtained in a similar fashion. The

solvation of the two solutes is studied for a ﬁxed surface-to-surface distance which we deﬁne

as s0 = r12

to a vapor bubble bridging the solutes. When curvature correction is applied (system II)

the mean curvature becomes nonzero and positive (concave) at z

although electrostatic attraction has been added between the solutes. The same trends

have been observed in explicit water simulations of a similar system of charged hydrophobic

nanosolutes [7].

These results clearly demonstrate that solvation eﬀects and solvent mediated phenomena

are not only strongly inﬂuenced by solute-solvent interactions, but that these interactions

are inherently coupled. By including coupling, our formalism captures the balance between

hydrophobic, dispersive and electrostatic forces which has been observed in previous studies

[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] but never described in a single theoretical framework. Nonpolar and polar

coupling is expected to be crucial for a complete characterization of biomolecular solvation.

The present formalism is only limited by the crude curvature and dielectric descriptions cur-

rently employed. Future eﬀorts to improve these approximations will be critical to accurately

describe solvation eﬀects on multiple length scales and for more complicated geometries.

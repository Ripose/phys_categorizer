Abstract

Eﬀective operators needed in single-beam two-photon transition calculations have been repre-

sented with modiﬁed Goldstone diagrams similar to the type suggested by Duan and co-workers

[J. Chem. Phys. 121, 5071 (2004) ]. The rules to evaluate these diagrams are diﬀerent from those

for eﬀective Hamiltonian and one-photon transition operators. It is veriﬁed that the perturbation

terms considered contain only connected diagrams and the evaluation rules are simpliﬁed and given

explicitly.

INTRODUCTION

Two-photon laser spectroscopy has been used as an important complementary technique

in studying optical materials containing lanthanide ions. A recent short review can be found

in Ref. 1. Two-photon excitation in a conventional microscope studying biological samples

provides great advantages, including low photo-damage and depth discrimination, reduced

photobleaching, good separation of the excitation light from the ﬂuorescence emission.

[2]

Two-photon lasers could give rise to entangled twin beams which oﬀer potential for novel

future applications.[3] A theoretical challenge in the ﬁeld of two-photon spectroscopy is

prediction of two-photon transition rates.[1, 4, 5]

Our work focuses on the calculation of single-beam two-photon absorption rates, partic-

ular for optical materials with lanthanides ions. In a former paper,[6] we have presented

the eﬀective operator method and given a perturbation expansion. In this paper we show

that the perturbation expansion can be represented with a kind of diagrams, which can

be calculated using one and two-particle matrix elements of interactions and single-particle

energies. In Section II, we show how to derive the diagrams from the perturbation expan-

sion; Section III presents those diagrams with only valence internal lines and unusual energy

denominators; In Section IV we show the cancellation of disconnected diagrams.

II. CONSTRUCTION OF DIAGRAMS FROM PERTURBATION EXPANSIONS

The calculation of two-photon transition rates has been reduced to the calculation of an

eﬀective transition operator[6]. The square modulus of the matrix element of the eﬀective

operator between two eigenstates of the eﬀective Hamiltonian (usually approximated with

semi-classical phenomenological Hamiltonian) is the two-photon transition line strength that

can be compared to measurements. In Ref.

[6], the eﬀective operator is partitioned into

two terms. The ﬁrst term is calculated with “direct method”[5, 6], and the second term

is calculated using many-body perturbation theory.

It has been shown Ref.[5] that this

method contains more general contributions than previous methods. Here we start from

that expansion for the second term and consider the usual case where the model space PI0

and PF 0 are the same complete model space, denoted as P0. By “complete model space”

we mean that the model space contains all the bases that can be formed by distributing

2

the valence electrons among the valence single particle states.[7, 8] Denoting the space

orthogonal to P0 by Q0, the perturbative expansion is simpliﬁed into the following form

eﬀ,i is the part of eﬀective operator zeroth (i = 0) and ﬁrst oder (i = 1) in V , k,

k1 and k2 sum over many-particle orthonormal eigenstates of H0 in Q0 and l sums over

eigenstates of H0 in P0. f and i are orthonormal eigenstates of H0 in P0.

The perturbation V contains both a one-body operator, denoted as V1 and a two-body

operator, denoted as V2. Usually the operator O is one-body operator. Using algebraic

representation and corresponding diagrammatic representation given in Ref.9, Eq. 1 and

Eq.4, O, V1 and V2 can be represented by 4, 4 and 9 diagrams respectively. Compositions of

two O’s and one V1 or V2, as given in Eq.2–8, with all possible contractions and all possible

relative positions, result into hundreds of diagrams. This prompts us to adapt the modiﬁed

diagrams given in Ref.9 to combine the set of diagrams with the same set of vertices, line

directions and contractions but diﬀerent relative position and internal orbit types into one

diagram.

A. Adapted connected diagrams with vertices V1 and two O

There are altogether 3 ingoing and 3 outgoing lines, with at least 2 pairs of them con-

tracted to form connected diagrams. Therefore the connected diagram can only be zero-body

3

(a constant) or one-body diagrams. A constant will not contribute to any transition, which

is neglected throughout of this paper.

There are three modiﬁed one-body diagrams as shown in Fig. 1. Similar to the the case

for eﬀective one-photon transition operators in Fig. 4 of Ref. 9, each diagram actually

represents contributions from several diﬀerent terms in Eq.2-Eq.8. For example Fig. 1(a),

with diﬀerent internal line types, includes contributions from Eq.2, Eq.3 and Eq.6. Note that

the energy denominator rules will be slightly diﬀerent from those for eﬀective one-photon

transition operators in Ref.9.

B. Adapted connected diagram with vertices V2 and two O

There are altogether 4 ingoing and 4 outgoing lines for for one V2 and two O. Therefore

connected diagrams can be zero-body, one-body and two-body.

There are also three modiﬁed one-body diagrams as shown in Fig. 2 , and ﬁve modiﬁed

two-body diagrams as shown in Fig. 3, where two diagrams complex conjugate to Fig.3(b)

and (c) are not given explicitly.

Similar to connected diagrams in Fig.1, Fig.2(a), includes contributions from Eq. 2, 3,

6. These contributions form altogether 6 diﬀerent normal diagrams. Note that the energy

denominator rules for contributions from diﬀerent terms are slightly diﬀerent.

C. Rules to evaluate these diagrams

Remembering that each modiﬁed diagram actually represents a set of diagrams with

diﬀerent ordering of vertices and diﬀerent types of internal lines, it is not diﬃcult to obtain

the analytic expressions for these diagrams. For each diagram with ﬁxed vertex ordering, the

expression can be calculated by the same rules 1)–7) given in Sec. II, Ref. [10], except that

the rule to calculate energy denominators in rule 6) should be modiﬁed as follows: Denoting

the net outﬂow energy of a loop enclosing vertices 1, 2, · · · , i as

Enoe(1, 2, · · · , i) = Enoe(1) + Enoe(2) + · · · + Enoe(i),

(9)

4

and supposing the number of O in the loop is iO (iO = 0, 1, 2) and the number of vertices

for the diagram is n, the energy denominator can be written as

D =

Enoe(1, 2, · · · , n) − Enoe(1, 2, · · · , i)

III. DIAGRAMS WITH VERTEX OPERATORS ACTING ONLY ON MODEL

SPACES P0

Eq. 4, 5 7 and 8 give diagrams with some vertices, whose bra states and ket states are

in model spaces P0. As an example, Eq. 4 have the same operator sequence OV O as that

of Eq. 6, but diﬀerent denominators. They will give diagrams with diﬀerent evaluation

rules, similar to but not exactly the same as those terms in eﬀective Hamiltonian that give

folded diagrams.[11, 12, 13] Instead of introducing new folded diagrams, we combine these

contributions to the diagrams given above. The rules to evaluate these contributions diﬀer

from standard rules in an overall factor −1/2 for diagrams from Eq.7 and Eq.8, and in

energy denominators by using rules given in Eq.4, Eq.5, Eq.7 and Eq.8.

IV. CANCELLATION OF DISCONNECTED DIAGRAMS

For modiﬁed disconnected diagrams with one V vertex and two O vertices, there must

be a connected part with only one vertex, which is either V or O.

Case A: V is disconnected from other parts.

In this case both the ingoing and the

outgoing lines of V are valence lines. Such a diagram includes contributions from Eq.6–8

with the same matrix elements but diﬀerent coeﬃcients due to diﬀerent energy denominators.

Suppose the net-outgoing-energies from the ﬁrst O and the second O vertices are ∆E1 and

∆E2 respectively, and that from the V is ∆E3. The three diﬀerent coeﬃcients for the three

contributions from Eq.6–8, respectively, are as follows

Case B: one O is disconnected from other parts. Such a diagram includes contributions from

Eq. 2–5. It can be veriﬁed in the same way as above that all these contributions cancel.

Diagrams for two-photon transitions rates have been constructed and have been shown

to be connected. Simpliﬁed one-photon diagrams given in J. Chem. Phys. 121, 5071 (2004)

have been adapted to two-photon cases. The algebraic expressions suitable for a general

two-photon calculation can be given from these diagrams.

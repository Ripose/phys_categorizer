Abstract

The internal space for a molecule, atom, or other n-body system can be

conveniently parameterised by 3n

9 kinematic angles and three kinematic

−

invariants. For a ﬁxed set of kinematic invariants, the kinematic angles pa-

rameterise a subspace, called a kinematic orbit, of the n-body internal space.

Building on an earlier analysis of the three- and four-body problems, we derive

the form of these kinematic orbits (that is, their topology) for the general n-

body problem. The case n = 5 is studied in detail, along with the previously

studied cases n = 3, 4.

I. INTRODUCTION

The group of kinematic rotations, called here the kinematic group, is an important set

of symmetries for the n-body kinetic energy. In fact, the kinematic group, to be deﬁned

precisely below, is the largest (compact, connected) group of such symmetries acting on the

n-body internal space. Not surprisingly then, the orbits (see Appendix A, Ref. [1]) of the

kinematic group provide a useful decomposition of the internal space. It is the purpose of

this paper to analyse these orbits and to determine their topology. We have been motivated

by molecular applications, but the results are quite general and could be applied to any

n-body system with rotational invariance, such as atoms or nuclei.

Although many reasons exist to study kinematic rotations and their orbits, our current

motivation derives from an interest in body frame singularities and their implications for the

quantum dynamics of n-body systems. In two previous papers [1,2], body frame singularities

in the three- and four-body problems were studied explicitly. The deﬁnition of body frame

singularities, their inevitability, the ﬂexibility one has in moving them, and their importance

for quantum dynamics are all discussed in Refs. [1,2]. A detailed study of frame singularities

has also been made by Pack [3]. Our earlier analysis of body frame singularities (especially

the singularities of the principal axis and related frames) involved extensive use of kinematic

2

rotations. The present paper extends the analysis of kinematic rotations to arbitrary n

and provides the basis for a future discussion of frame singularities for the general n-body

problem. Although the present paper concentrates on kinematic orbits in their own right,

for motivational reasons, we provide a brief two paragraph account of frame singularities,

referring to Refs. [1–3] for greater detail.

An early and necessary step in many quantum n-body computations is choosing a set

of body-ﬁxed axes, that is, a body frame. The principal axis frame, in which the body-

ﬁxed axes are aligned with the principal axes, is one common choice. The body frame is a

function of the shape of the system, by which we mean the positions of the bodies relative

to each other; the shape may be parameterised by 3n

6 internal coordinates. As has been

−

previously noted [1–3], a body frame may fail to be a smooth function of shape, and thus

there may be points in the internal, or shape, space at which it is singular. (In this paper, the

internal space and shape space are synonymous.) For example, in the three-body problem,

the principal axis frame is singular at all oblate symmetric tops (among other shapes), and

in the four-body problem, the principal axis frame is singular at all symmetric tops (among

other shapes). Body frame singularities have important consequences for the form of the

quantum wave function: roughly speaking, the wave function has singularities matching

those of the body frame. An understanding of body frame singularities is therefore critical

for understanding the singularities of the n-body wave function.

The location of the body frame singularities in shape space depends on the choice of body

frame; by choosing diﬀerent frames one can move these singularities about or possibly remove

them altogether (as is essentially the case for the three-body problem [2,3]). Thus, for many

problems one can choose a frame whose singularities are outside the physically relevant region

of shape space. This is true of small vibration problems (about a noncollinear equilibrium)

in which the wave function is localised around an equilibrium shape. However, for scattering

states and delocalised bound states, it becomes harder to eliminate the singularities from

the region of interest. For certain regions, it becomes topologically impossible to remove

them completely and one must then understand their eﬀects.

3

Though the study of kinematic orbits is developed here with the ultimate intent of

developing a deeper understanding of frame singularities, several other reasons motivate

our work. First, since the kinematic group is the largest (compact, connected) group of

symmetries (of the kinetic energy) acting on shape space, the kinematic orbits provide

an important foliation of shape space with which to study the kinetic energy operator.

Furthermore, this foliation suggests a convenient method of deﬁning internal, or shape,

coordinates [4–11]: three internal coordinates are chosen to be kinematic invariants (for

example, the three principal moments of inertia), which label a particular kinematic orbit,

and the remaining 3n

9 internal coordinates are chosen to be kinematic angles, which

−

parameterise the position along the kinematic orbit. Deﬁning these angles and properly

specifying their ranges requires a clear understanding of the topology of the orbits. Finally,

certain large amplitude internal motions, such as pseudorotations, can be approximated by

kinematic rotations. For such systems, it may be convenient to restrict the region of physical

interest to a single kinematic orbit.

The kinematic group is commonly viewed as the set of discrete transformations between

diﬀerent conventions for Jacobi vectors. Here, however, we deﬁne the kinematic group to

be a continuous symmetry group, namely SO(n

1), which contains these transformations.

The elements of the kinematic group SO(n

1) are called kinematic rotations to distinguish

them from the ordinary external SO(3) rotations. (Sometimes the terminology “democracy

−

−

transformations” and “democracy group” is used.) Kinematic rotations act (in the active

sense) on the Jacobi vectors as shown in Eq. (2.3), from which one sees that they commute

with external rotations (as shown in Eq. (2.1)). Therefore, kinematic rotations do indeed

have a well-deﬁned action on the shape of an n-body system. It is the orbits of this action

of the kinematic rotations, for arbitrary n, which we compute in the present paper.

As examples of our general analysis, we specialise to the three- and four-body problems,

recovering the previously known results found in Refs. [1,2,12]. The kinematic orbits for the

three- and four-body cases do not exhibit the full range of diversity found in the general

n-body problem and are thus somewhat special. For example, in the four-body problem the

4

kinematic orbits can be classiﬁed by whether a shape is an asymmetric top, a symmetric

top, or a spherical top, a classiﬁcation which does not hold in the general n-body case. We

therefore also specialise to the ﬁve-body problem, for which the results are not previously

known. As with the three- and four-body problems, the kinematic orbits for the ﬁve-body

problem have particularly simple forms. However, there are seven classes of kinematic orbits,

which is representative of the general n-body case.

The approach and methods used in this paper are geometrical in nature. We assume

familiarity with the techniques of Refs. [1,2] and some basic understanding of Lie groups,

their actions on manifolds, and the quotients by such actions. Appendix A of Ref. [1]

provides a useful review, as do many basic texts [13,14].

The structure of the paper is as follows. Section II contains the principal derivations,

in which we determine the isotropy subgroup of the kinematic action on shape space. This

subgroup is related to the kinematic orbit via Eq. (2.5). The results of Sect. II are sum-

marised in Table I. The results for arbitrary n are discussed brieﬂy in Sect. III where we

focus primarily on the collinear shapes. In Sect. IV we specialise the results of Sect. II to

the three- and four-body problems, and these results are summarised in Tables II and III.

Similarly, in Sect. V, we specialise to the ﬁve-body problem. This requires substantially

more work than the three- and four-body cases which causes Sect. V to constitute almost

half of the paper. The ﬁve-body results are summarised in Table IV. Our conclusions are in

Sect. VI. We also include an Appendix containing three important theorems on the actions

of Lie groups.

II. THE TOPOLOGY OF KINEMATIC ORBITS FOR ARBITRARY n

In the centre of mass frame, the conﬁguration of an n-body system is parameterised by

n

1 (mass-weighted) Jacobi vectors rsα, α = 1, .., n

1. Here, the s subscript indicates

−

−

that the components of rsα are referred to a space-ﬁxed frame. Jacobi vectors are a standard

topic and we refer to the literature for more details on their deﬁnition and analysis [15,16].

5

For notational convenience we also introduce the 3

(n

1) matrix Fs whose columns are

the Jacobi vectors. Explicitly, Fsiα = rsαi, i = 1, 2, 3, α = 1, .., n

1, where Fsiα and rsαi

×

−

−

are the components of Fs and rsα respectively.

An ordinary rotation Q

SO(3) acts on the Jacobi vectors by standard multiplication

on the left

We call such a rotation an external rotation to distinguish it from a kinematic rotation. A

where Kαβ denotes the components of K and T denotes the matrix transpose. Notice that

kinematic rotations commute with all external rotations. Thus, the kinematic group has

a well-deﬁned action on the quotient of conﬁguration space R3n−3 by the group SO(3) of

external rotations. This quotient is called shape space, or the internal space, and its elements

are called shapes. A shape thus determines the relative positions of the bodies with respect

to each other. The purpose of this section is to ﬁnd the topology of the orbits of the

kinematic group acting on shape space.

for which K

SO(3) such that

QΛ(HT KH)T = Λ.

(2.10)

The above equation shows that the isotropy subgroup S of the action of the kinematic group

on the shape q is conjugate to the isotropy subgroup of the action of the kinematic group

on the shape of the conﬁguration Λ. Replacing S by a conjugate subgroup in Eq. (2.5) does

not eﬀect the resulting manifold Γ (up to diﬀeomorphism). Thus, we assume without loss of

generality that Fs = Λ, and hence we look to ﬁnd all K

SO(n

QΛKT = Λ.

The answer depends on the rank of Λ, which we denote by d. The quantity d physically

represents the dimensionality of the shape q. Thus, the n-body collision has d = 0, linear

shapes have d = 1, planar shapes have d = 2, and full three-dimensional shapes have d = 3.

For all values of d, Λ may be “block diagonalised” in the following manner

The ﬁrst equation follows from Eq. (2.11). The last two equations ensure that K and Q have

positive determinant.

It can be shown, due to the fact that Σ is invertible and A, C

O(d), that Eq. (2.15)

∈

can only be solved if C = A. This in turn allows Eq. (2.17) to be rewritten as

(2.15)

(2.16)

(2.17)

(2.18)

Recall that D is of dimension 3

d. Therefore, if d = 3, the matrix D is completely eliminated

−

from consideration, and Eq. (2.18) becomes simply

det A = 1.

(2.19)

However, if d < 3, then there always exists an orthogonal matrix D such that det D = det A.

Thus, Eq. (2.18) imposes no constraint whatsoever on A.

For the sake of clarity, we now summarise the problem at hand. For an arbitrary diagonal

d matrix Σ, with nonzero eigenvalues λi, i = 1, .., d satisfying Eq. (2.9), we seek all

(required for d = 3 only)

(2.20)

(2.21)

(2.22)

Notice that we have eliminated all reference to the matrix Q.

To proceed we consider each of the values of d = 0, 1, 2, 3 separately.

From Eqs. (2.21) and (2.22), we see that det A = det B = 1. Thus, B is an element

of SO(n

4) and is independent of A. To ﬁnd the allowed values of A, we consider three

−

subcases: (i) all of the λi’s are distinct, (ii) two of the λi’s are equal, the third is distinct,

(iii) all of the λi’s are equal. Physically, these subcases correspond to shapes which are

asymmetric tops, symmetric tops, and spherical tops respectively.

Assume subcase (i). This is perhaps the most important class of shapes since three-

dimensional asymmetric tops are generic in shape space. From Eq. (2.20) and the fact that

Σ is diagonal, A must be one of the four matrices in the group V4, where

The group V4 is called the viergruppe.

It played a critical roll in earlier analysis of the

four-body problem [1,12]; we will reproduce part of this earlier analysis in Sect. IV. Thus,

K lives in a subgroup of SO(n

SO(n

diagonal, with a 2

O(2) and a 1

1 block which must

O(2) and hence O(2)

tops.

Assume subcase (iii). Since all eigenvalues of Σ are equal, Σ is proportional to the

identity. Hence, A can be any element of SO(3), and hence SO(3)

Case d = 2

We consider two subcases: (i) λ1

asymmetric and symmetric tops respectively.

Assume subcase (i). Since Σ is diagonal with two diﬀerent eigenvalues, A must be one

of the four matrices in the group V4, where

III. COMMENTS ON THE GENERAL RESULTS

We summarise the results from the preceding section in Table I and comment on a few

special cases. First, as was to be expected the kinematic orbit passing through the n-body

collision is a single point Γ = SO(n

A more interesting case is that of the collinear shapes. It is a well-known fact that

SO(k + 1)
O(k)

= RP k,

(3.1)

where RP k is the k-dimensional real projective space (k

projective space is the space of lines in Rk+1. It may also be viewed as the k-dimensional

aid of Theorem 1, taking

Since the orbit of the action of SO(k + 1) on RP k is the entire space RP k, Eq. (3.1) follows

from Theorem 2.

Applying Eq. (3.1), we see that the kinematic orbit of a collinear shape is

(3.3)

For the four-body problem (in three-dimensions) the two-fragment exit channels can be

visualised as seven pairs of antipodal points on S2 or, equivalently, seven points on RP 2

[1,17]. Kinematic angles between these points were explicitly computed in Ref. [17]. These

results were based on the understanding that RP 2 is the kinematic orbit for collinear shapes

in the four-body problem.1 (The interest in collinear shapes stems from the fact that a two-

fragment state becomes more and more collinear as the separation between the fragments

increases.) The four-body work was an extension of well-known results for the three-body

problem (in three-dimensions) in which the two-fragment exit channels can be visualised

as three points on a circle S1 = RP 1 with certain kinematic angles between them. The

result presented in Eq. (3.3) shows that in general the two-fragment exit channels can be

viewed as points on RP n−2, or equivalently, pairs of antipodal points on Sn−2. (Some quick

combinatorics gives the number of points on RP n−2 to be 2n−1

1.) Of course, this is only

shapes in the one-dimensional four-body problem. We ignore the one-dimensional n-body problem

IV. THE THREE- AND FOUR-BODY PROBLEMS

We specialise the preceding analysis to the three- and four-body problems. These cases

have been studied earlier [1,2,12]. The present analysis serves both as a check on the general

results in Sect. II and as practice for the ﬁve-body problem.

We begin with the three-body problem n = 3. In the analysis of Sect. II we assumed

for convenience that n

4. However, by closely examining this analysis, one sees that the

≥

results presented in Table I are also valid for n = 3, so long as one ignores the nonsensical

results for the three-dimensional classes 3(i), 3(ii), and 3(iii). For the classes 2(i) and 2(ii),

the factor O(n

3) = O(0) of S is to be ignored. Thus, the isotropy subgroup of the class

−

2(i) is the two-element group S = Z2 consisting of those elements of V4 in Eq. (2.24) with

unit determinant. Similarly, the isotropy subgroup of the class 2(ii) is SO(2). For the class

1, the isotropy subgroup is S = O(1) =

+1,

= Z2. These results are summarised in

Table II.

aΓ = kinematic orbit = SO(2)/S

Since the kinematic group SO(2) is particularly simple, the topology of the kinematic

orbits may be presented in a more direct and illuminating form than the quotient SO(2)/S.

These forms are recorded in the rightmost column of Table II. For the three-body problem,

we can provide a convenient picture of the kinematic rotations which explains why the kine-

matic orbits have the topologies that they do. The three-body shape space is conveniently

parameterised by three internal coordinates (w1, w2, w3) with ranges

< w1, w2 <

,

∞
. The kinematic rotations act on shape space via standard SO(3) matrices ro-

tating about the w3-axis. It so happens that the w3-axis consists of the planar (noncollinear)

symmetric tops as well as the 3-body collision. Thus, the kinematic orbits of these shapes

contain a single point, whereas the kinematic orbits of all other shapes are circles about the

w3-axis.

Turning to the four-body problem, we specialise the entries of Table I for n = 4 and

display the results in Table III. For the classes 3(i), 3(ii), and 3(iii) we ignore the factor

SO(n

4) = SO(0). For the classes 2(i) and 2(ii), the factor O(n

3) reduces to O(1) =

−

+1,

. Since the choice of +1 or

1 in O(1) is ﬁxed by the det = +1 constraint, the

}

{
isotropy subgroup for classes 2(i) and 2(ii) are V4 and O(2) respectively. An interesting

−

observation is that the results for the four-body problem are classiﬁed solely on the basis

of the symmetries of the moment of inertia tensor. That is, the topology of the kinematic

orbit depends only on whether a shape is a spherical top, symmetric top, or asymmetric

top. (This fact is not true for n = 3 or n

5.)

orbits in a more direct and illuminating form than simply the quotient SO(3)/S. We already

explained in Sect. III, how the equality SO(3)/SO(2) = RP 2 comes about. Thus, the only

orbit which requires special attention here is

V. THE FIVE-BODY PROBLEM

The entries of Table I are specialised for the ﬁve-body problem, n = 5, and displayed

in Table IV. As with the three- and four-body cases, we also represent the topology of

the kinematic orbits in a more direct and illuminating form than the original quotient

Γ = SO(4)/S.

Before deriving the results in Table IV, we make a few observations. First, for all

classes but 2(ii) we present the kinematic orbits as products of well-studied two- and three-

dimensional manifolds. In fact, all of these simpler manifolds already appear in the four-body

problem, either as kinematic orbits or as the group manifold SO(3) = RP 3. One obvious

advantage of such a simple description of the topologies of these spaces is that it simpliﬁes

the introduction of kinematic angles or some other parameterisation of the orbits. For

example, in the case of a 3D asymmetric top, we may introduce six kinematic angles by

taking three to be standard Euler angles on S3 = SU(2) and three to be Euler angles on

S3/V8. The ranges of the latter three angles must be carefully restricted to account for the

fact that S3/V8 is only one eighth the size of S3. A discussion of the ranges of such angles

has already been given in the context of the four-body problem [11,12,18,19]. Of course, the

space S3/V8 can be parameterised in various other ways, such as the convenient coordinates

τ = (τ1, τ2, τ3) suggested by Reinsch [1,20].

It is interesting to note that the kinematic orbit of a collinear shape is RP 3 = SO(3). A

point on such an orbit (such as one of the two-fragment exit channels discussed in Sect. III)

can therefore be identiﬁed with a rotation matrix and may in turn be parameterised by

one of the many standard parameterisations of SO(3) (Euler angles, axis-angle variables,

Cayley-Klein parameters, etc.).

We proceed now to derive the results of Table IV.

A. The Projection π from SU (2)

SU (2) to SO(4)

×

With the four-body problem, we have found it useful to work with the double cover

SU(2) of the kinematic group SO(3). With the ﬁve-body problem, we also ﬁnd it useful

to work with the double cover of the kinematic group. In this case, the kinematic group is

SO(4) and its double cover is SU(2)

SU(2). In this section we give an explicit realization

of the projection from SU(2)

SU(2) to SO(4).

where a and b are real numbers. The function g is real linear and preserves multiplication.

Speciﬁcally, it is straightforward to verify the following identities

g(z1 + az2) = g(z1) + ag(z2),

g(z1z2) = g(z1)g(z2),

g(MN) = g(M)g(N),

where M and N are square complex matrices, M† is the Hermitian conjugate of M, and a is a

To prove Eq. (5.13), we ﬁrst assume that M is normal and invertible, which allows us to

write M = exp X for some matrix X. Then,

det g(M) = det[g(exp X)] = det[exp g(X)] = exp[tr g(X)] = exp[tr X + (tr X)∗]

= det(exp X)[det(exp X)]∗ =

(5.15)

where we have used Eq. (5.12) and Eq. (5.21) (which appears below) as well as the fact that

det exp = exp tr. We now consider an arbitrary (possibly non-normal) invertible matrix M

and note that it may be written as a product of normal matrices (using, for example, polar or

principal value decompositions). Using this fact and Eq. (5.10), we observe that Eq. (5.13)

holds for M as well. Having shown that Eq. (5.13) is valid for all invertible matrices, analytic

continuation shows that it is valid for all matrices.

We now deﬁne π from SU(2)

SU(2) to SO(4) by

a group homomorphism we must verify the following equation

π(U1V−1

again from Eq. (5.16).

We return now to prove Eq. (5.19). We ﬁnd it convenient to work with the Lie algebras

su(2) and so(4) of SU(2) and SO(4) respectively. We see from Eq. (5.11) that if X

exp[g(X)] exp[Pg(Y)PT ] = exp[Pg(Y)PT ] exp[g(X)].

The matrices Ji, i = 1, 2, 3 and Li, i = 1, 2, 3 are a basis of the Lie algebra so(4) and it is

The above equations exhibit the well-known fact that so(4) = su(2)

su(2). Since the

matrices Ji and Li span the space of matrices of the form g(X) and Pg(Y)PT respectively

su(2)), Eq. (5.34) proves Eq. (5.24), from which follows Eqs. (5.23), (5.19), and

(5.18). We have thus shown π to be a group homomorphism.

The mapping π has several important properties which we will use later. First, it follows

directly from the deﬁnition Eq. (5.16) that for arbitrary group elements (U1, U2)

From Eq. (5.16) we see that π(ωi, ωi) = JiLi, where Ji and Li are given by Eqs. (5.26) –

(5.31). By direct matrix multiplication, we ﬁnd

π(ωi, ωi) = JiLi = Ei.

arbitrary subgroup of SU(2), then ˜H is an isomorphic subgroup of SU(2)

The quotient SU(2)/B is diﬀeomorphic to RP 2. To prove this, we ﬁrst consider the quotient

SU(2)/A = SU(2)/U(1). It is well known that SU(2)/U(1) = S2. One way of seeing this

fact is to consider the action of SU(2) on R3 via the 3

3 orthogonal matrices given in

×

Eq. (4.10). The orbit of SU(2) acting on ˆz

R3 is clearly the sphere S2. The isotropy

∈
subgroup of the vector ˆz is the group A of U(1) rotations about the ˆz-axis. Theorem 1 thus

gives the desired result

SU(2)
A

= S2.

(5.61)

Furthermore, we note the following explicit identiﬁcation between a right coset [U] = AU

SU(2)/A and a unit vector ˆn

where R is given by Eq. (4.10) and ω = (ω1, ω2, ω3). We have placed the transpose on R in

order that ˆn be well-deﬁned for right cosets; observe that the right hand side of Eq. (5.62)

is invariant under U

exp(θω3)U.

Having computed SU(2)/A, we apply Theorem 3 to compute SU(2)/B. With regards

to the notation of the theorem, we take G = B, H = A and M = SU(2). We ﬁrst must

verify that A is normal in B. Proving this fact reduces to showing that ω1 exp(θω3)ω†

1 is in

A for an arbitrary exp(θω3)

A. This fact, in turn, follows immediately from Eq. (5.59).

Thus, A is normal in B and B/A is a well-deﬁned group isomorphic to Z2. According to

Theorem 3, the non-identity element [ω1]

B/A acts on [U]

SU(2)/A by [ω1][U] = [ω1U].

VI. CONCLUSIONS

For the general n-body problem, we have expressed a kinematic orbit as the quotient of

the kinematic group by the isotropy subgroup of the shape in question. We have computed

these isotropy subgroups explicitly. For the three-, four-, and ﬁve-body cases, we have

represented the kinematic orbits in terms of simple well-studied spaces of low dimension.

We have also showed that the kinematic orbit of a collinear shape is RP n−2 for any n.

The natural next step for us to take is an analysis of body frame singularities for n

5.

≥

We envision such an analysis beginning, as in the case of the three- and four-body analysis

[1,2], with a detailed study of the principal axis frame and its singularities. As in the

previous analysis, this would amount to ﬁnding the fundamental group of the asymmetric

33

top region of shape space and then relating the paths (or more precisely the equivalence

classes of paths) in this group to the jumps in the principal axis frame.

In the three- and four-body problems, one can ﬁnd a frame related to the principal

axis frame which has a smaller set of frame singularities. In particular, the frame jumps

can be completely eliminated. A natural question is whether such a frame exists for n

5.

≥

Extending this line of inquiry, another natural question is which frames have the smallest set

of singularities and what constraints are placed on one’s ability to move these singularities

around. We believe that the study of frames restricted to the kinematic orbits may shed

some light on these issues. For example, it would be useful to know, in the language of ﬁbre

bundles, whether the SO(3) bundles deﬁned over the kinematic orbits are trivial or not.

for many of the steps presented in the bulk of the paper. The ﬁrst result is a standard

theorem and is found, for example, in Bredon (Ref. [14], p. 303, Corollary 1.3).

Theorem 1 Let G be a compact Lie group acting smoothly on a smooth manifold M. Then

the orbit through a point x

M is diﬀeomorphic to G/H where H is the isotropy subgroup

∈

of G at x. (That is, H contains all elements of G which leave x ﬁxed.)

The next result is useful for simplifying the descriptions of several manifolds appearing

in the ﬁve-body problem. It is similar to an exercise of Bredon (Ref. [14], p. 113, Exercise 9).

Theorem 2 Let G be a compact Lie group and H a Lie subgroup of G. Let ˜H be the

following Lie subgroup of G

The following theorem is a reﬁnement of an exercise in Bredon (Ref. [14], p. 67, Exercise

1) to the case of smooth actions. We omit the straightforward proof.

Theorem 3 Let G be a compact Lie group and H a normal Lie subgroup of G so that G/H

is itself a Lie group. Let G act smoothly upon a smooth manifold M. Assume that the

isotropy subgroups of this action are all conjugate to one another so that M/G and M/H

are themselves smooth manifolds. Then, G/H has a well-deﬁned action on M/H given

by [g]H[x]H = [gx]H, where [g]H

G/H and [x]H

M/H. Furthermore, the following

PHOTO-INDUCED INTERMOLECULAR CHARGE TRANSFER
IN PORPHYRIN COMPLEXES

Michael Schreiber, Dmitry Kilin, and Ulrich Kleinekath¨ofer

Institut f¨ur Physik, Technische Universit¨at, D-09107 Chemnitz, Germany

Optical excitation of the sequential supermolecule H2P − ZnP − Q induces
an electron transfer from the free-base porphyrin (H2P ) to the quinone (Q)
via the zinc porphyrin (ZnP ). This process is modeled by equations of
motion for the reduced density matrix which are solved numerically and
approximately analytically. These two solutions agree very well in a great
region of parameter space. It is shown that for the majority of solvents the
electron transfer occurs with the superexchange mechanism.

I. INTRODUCTION

The investigation of photoinduced charge transfer is important both for the de-
scription of natural photosynthesis [] and for the creation of artiﬁcial photoenergy-
converting devices []. For experimental realizations of such artiﬁcial devices porphyrin
complexes are good candidates []. Of major interest are those complexes with an ad-
ditional bridging block between donor and acceptor [].

Electron transfer reactions can occur through diﬀerent mechanism []: sequential
transfer (ST) or superexchange (SE). Changing a building block of the complex []
or changing the environment [] can modify which mechanism is most signiﬁcant.
To clarify which mechanism is present one sequentially varies the energetics of the
complex []. This is done by radical substituting the porphyrin complexes [] or by
changing the polarity of the solvent []. Also the geometry and size of a bridging block
can be varied and in this way the length of the subsystem through which the electron
has to be transfered [].

SE [] occurs due to coherent mixing of the levels [] and plays a role for any detuning
of the energy levels []. The transfer rate in this channel decreases exponentially with
increasing length of the bridge []. When incoherent eﬀects such as dissipation and
dephasing dominate [], the transfer is mainly sequential [], i. e., the levels are occupied
mainly in sequential order []. An increase in the bridge length induces only a small
reduction in the transfer rate [].

In the case of coherent SE the dynamics is mainly Hamiltonian and can be de-
scribed on the basis of the Schr¨odinger equation. The physically important results
can be obtained by perturbation theory [], most successfully by the Marcus theory
[].
In case of ST the environmental inﬂuence has to be taken into account. The
more natural description of the relaxation process is based on the density matrix
(DM) formalism []. The master equation that governs the DM evolution as well as
the appropriate relaxation coeﬃcients can be derived from such basic information as
system-environment coupling strength and spectral density of the environment [].

The main physics of the system can be described by a DM equation which accounts
for relaxation eﬀects phenomenologically []. The master equation is analytically solv-
able only for the simplest models []. Most investigations are based on the numerical
solution of this equation []. However, an estimations can be obtained within the
steady-state approximation []. Here we perform numerical as well as approximate
analytical calculations.

II. MODEL

We investigate the photoinduced electron transfer in supermolecules that consist
of sequentially connected molecular blocks, namely donor, bridge, and acceptor. The
donor (D) is not able to transfer its charge directly to the acceptor (A) because of

their spatial separation. D and A can exchange their charges only through B (Fig. 1).
In the present investigation the supermolecule consists of free-base porphyrin(H2P )
as donor, zinc substituted porphyrin(ZnP ) as bridge, and benzoquinone as accep-
tor [].
In each of those molecular blocks we consider only two molecular orbitals,
the LUMO and the HOMO. Each of those orbitals can be occupied by an elec-
tron (|1i) or not (|0i). This model allows us to describe the neutral nonexcited
molecule |1iHOM O|0iLU M O and the following three states of the molecule: neutral
excited molecule |0iHOM O|1iLU M O, positive ion |0iHOM O|0iLU M O , and negative ion
|1iHOM O|1iLU M O. Below Roman indices indicate molecular orbitals (m = 0 - HOMO,
m = 1 - LUMO), while Greek indices indicate molecular blocks (µ = 1 - donor, µ = 2
- bridge, µ = 3 - acceptor). Each of the electronic states has its own vibrational
substructure. However the time of vibrational relaxation [] is two orders of magni-
tude faster than the characteristic time of the electron transfer []. Because of this
we assume that only the vibrational ground states play a dominant role in electron
transfer.

One can describe the occupation of an orbital by an electron with the appropriate
µm = |1iµmh0|µm as well as its annihilation cµm = |0iµmh1|µm.

µmcµm gives the number of electrons in the molecular block µ.

For the description of charge transfer and other dynamical processes in the system

we introduce the Hamiltonian

ˆH = ˆHS + ˆHB + ˆHSB ,

where HS characterizes the supermolecule, HB the dissipative bath, and HSB the
interaction between the two. HS, however, includes the static inﬂuence of the envi-
ronment, namely of the solvent dipoles, which gives rise to a reduction of the energy
levels,

describes the energy to create an isolated ion. This term depends on the characteristic
radius rµ of the molecular blocks. ˆEion = Pµ Pν(ˆnµ − 1)(ˆnν − 1)e2/(4πǫ0rµν) includes
the interaction between the already created ions. It depends on the distance between
the molecular blocks rµν. The last contribution to the system Hamiltonian is the
hopping term ˆV = Pµν vµν( ˆV +
µν)((ˆnµ − 1)2 + (ˆnν − 1)2), which includes the
coherent hopping between each pair of LUMO ˆV −
ν1cµ1, ˆV + = ( ˆV −)+ as well as
the corresponding intensities vµν. The matrix elements of this operator give nonzero
contribution only if one of the states has a charge separation. Because there is no
direct connection between donor and acceptor we assume v13 = 0.

As usual the bath is given by harmonic oscillators with creation and anhilation

radiative transitions. For t ≪ 1 − 10 ns the latter one can be neglected . The
irradiative contribution corresponds to energy transfer to the solvent and spreading

tracing out the bath modes [] we obtain the equation of motion for the reduced density

For simplicity we introduce a superindex i = {µm}, the intensities of the dissi-
pative transitions dij = Γijn(−ωij) between each pair of states, as well as the corre-

The simpliﬁcation is that we do not calculate the system parameters, rather we
extract them from experimental data.

III. EXTRACTION OF SYSTEM PARAMETERS

The porphyrin absorption spectra [] consist of high frequency Soret bands and
low frequency Q bands. In case of ZnP the Q band has two subbands, Q(0, 0) and
Q(1, 0). In the free-base porphyrin H2P the reduction of symmetry induces a splitting
of each subband into two, namely Qx(0, 0), Qy(0, 0) and Qx(1, 0), Qy(1, 0). So the
emission spectra of ZnP and H2P consist of two and four bands, respectively. Each
of the abovementioned spectra can be represented as a sum of Lorentzians with good
precision. It is important to note that the spectra of porphyrin complexes contain all
bands of the isolated porphyrins without essential changes. We use the lowest band
of each spectrum. The corresponding frequencies and widths are shown in table 1.

On the basis of the experimental spectra we determine ED∗BA = 1.82eV and
EDB∗A = 2.03eV (in CH2Cl2). The authors of Ref. give the energies of two other
levels, ED+B−A = 2.44eV and ED+BA− = 1.42eV . This allows to calculate EDB+A− =
1.21eV . The hopping intensity v23 = v = 2.2meV is calculated in Ref. . On the
other hand Rempel et al. [] estimate the electron coupling of the initially excited and
charged bridge states v12 = V = 65meV . We take the intensity of the intermolecular
conversions Γ21, Γ23 in range 1 − 10 × 1011s−1 [].

The main parameter which controls the electron transfer in a triad is the relative
energy of the state D+B−A. This state has a strong coupling to the solvent that
changes the energy of the state. The values of the energy ED+B−A calculated in
the present model are shown in table 2 for some solvents. In table 2 ǫs denotes the
static dielectric permittivity, ǫ∞ the optic dielectric permittivity, MTHF 2-methil-
tetrahydrofuran, and CYCLO denotes cyclohexane. The calculated value ED+B−A =
2.86eV deviates 15% from the data of Ref. .

IV. RESULTS

The time evolution of charge transfer within the supermolecule is described by
Eqs. (5) and (6). At initial time only the donor state is occupied. The calcula-
tions were performed with two methods, direct numerical integration and analytic
approximation.

For the numerical simulation the eigenvalues and -vectors of the system are cal-
culated and with these the time evolution of the system is known. The simulation of
the system dynamics with the parameters determined in the previous section shows
exponential growth of the acceptor population. Such a behavior can be accurately
ﬁtted to the formula P3(t) = P3(∞)[1 − exp (−kET t)], where kET ≃ 5 × 109s−1 and
P3(∞) ≃ 0.95 for CH2Cl2 as solvent. The population of the bridge state does not ex-
ceed 0.005. This shows that the SE mechanism dominates over the ST for the chosen
set of parameters. In this case the system dynamics can be described by two values:
the acceptor population at inﬁnite time P3(∞) and the reaction rate kET that we

deduce from the dynamics via the following formula kET = P3(∞)/{R
The analytical approach is valid for the kinetic limit t ≫ 1/γij. In Laplace-space
we can replace 1/(iωij +γij +s) by 1/(iωij +γij), where s denotes the Laplace variable.
This allows to simplify Eqs. (5) and (6) and we deﬁne a new relaxation operator

Assuming the bridge population to be zero allows us to ﬁnd the dynamics of the

V. DISCUSSION

The following question will now be discussed: How does the mechanism and speed
of the reaction depend on a deviation of the parameters from the determined values?
Namely which parameters have to be changed in order to change not only the reaction
rate quantitatively, but the dominant mechanism of reaction and the qualitative
behavior of dynamics at all. To answer these questions we calculate the system
dynamics while varying one parameter at a time and keeping the other parameters
unchanged. The dependencies of transfer rate kET and ﬁnal population P3(∞) on
coherent couplings V = v12, v = v23 and dissipation intensities Γ = Γ21, γ = Γ23 are
shown in Fig. 2.

In particular, the decrease of the coherent coupling V induces a quadratic decrease
of the reaction rate kET until saturation V ∼ 1010ps−1. Then kET reaches its lower
bound and does not depend on V anymore. This corresponds to the crossover of the
reaction mechanism from SE mechanism to ST. But, due to the big energy diﬀerence

between donor and bridge state the eﬃciency of this ST is extremely low, i. e., P3 ; 0.
The considered variation of the coherent coupling can be experimentally performed
by exchanging building blocks in the supermolecule.

The most crucial change in the reaction dynamics can be induced by changing
the energies of the system levels. As discussed above this can be done by altering the
solvent. Most important is the relative energy of the bridge state |D+B−Ai. The
results of the corresponding calculations are presented in Fig. 3. For high energies of
the bridge state ED+B−A ≫ ED∗BA the numerical and analytical results do not diﬀer
from each other. The reaction occurs with the SE mechanism that coincides with
the conclusion of Ref. . This is the case for the most of solvents (see table 2). The
smooth decrease of energy induces an increase of the reaction rate up to the maximal
value near 1ps−1.

While the bridge energy approaches the energy of the donor state the ST mecha-
nism starts to contribute to the process. As can be seen in table 2 this regime can be
reached by the use strong polar solvents. The analytical solution does not coincide
with the numerical one anymore because the used approximations are no more valid
in this region. In the case ED+B−A < ED+BA− one cannot approximate the dynamics
of the acceptor population in the form P3 ∼ [1 − exp (−kET t)]. A high value of the
bridge energy ensures the transition of the whole population to the acceptor state
|D+BA−i. In the intermediate case, when the bridge state has the same energy as the
acceptor state, the ﬁnal population spreads itself over these two states P3(∞) = 0.5.
At even lower bridge energies the population gets trapped at the bridge state.

We performed calculations for the electron transfer in the supermolecular complex
H2P − ZnP − Q within the RDM formalism. The resulting analytical and numerical
reaction rates are in good agreement with each other and in qualitative correspon-
dence with experimental data []. The SE mechanism of electron transfer dominates
over the sequential one. The qualitative character of the transfer reaction is stable
with respect to a small variation of the system parameter. The crossover between the
reaction mechanisms can be forced by lowering the bridge state energy to the energy
of the donor state.

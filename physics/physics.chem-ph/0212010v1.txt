Theory of adiabatic Hexaamminecobalt-Self-Exchange

(Dated: February 2, 2008)
We have reexamined the thermally induced Co(N H3)2+/3+

[Co(II/III)] redox reaction using the
ﬁrst principles density-functional-theory method, semiclassical Marcus theory, and known charge
transfer parameters. We conﬁrm a previously suggested mechanism involving excited state (2Eg) of
Co(II) which becomes lower than the ground state (4T1g) in the transition state region. This lowers
the transition state barrier considerably by ∼ 6.9kcal/mol and leads to a spin-allowed and adia-
batic electron exchange process. Our calculations are consistent with previous experimental results
regarding the spin-excitation energy (3T1g) of Co(III), and the fact that an optical absorption peak
(2Eg) of the Co(II) species could not be found experimentally. Our rate is of order 6 · 10−3(M s)−1
and hence 2 orders of magnitude faster than determined previously by experiments.

has been a great intellectual challenge for several decades.
Despite substantial eﬀort, the mechanism of the rate is
still an unsolved problem. Is the reaction spin-forbidden
and diabatic or are spin-excited states thermally accessi-
ble which would possibly lead to a spin-allowed, adiabatic
reaction?

·

·

Experimental studies in the early 1960s suggested an
10−10(M s)−1 [1] at 64.5 C
extremely slow rate of k = 1.6
and 1 M ionic strength using radiocobalt 60C as a tracer.
Unfortunately, side reactions involving hydrolysis of the
complexes, which contribute to the rate, have not cor-
rectly been taken into account. In the 1980s a detailed
analysis of previous data using the Marcus correlation[2]
10−5(M s)−1 [3],
led to a much higher estimate of 1
and subsequent experiments labeling the ammonia lig-
ands with 15N (which can be assayed by NMR of the
ammine protons and make it possible to trace side reac-
10−6(M s)−1 at 40 C and 2.5 M ionic
tions) gave about 6
strength [4]. An estimate of the rate at normal conditions
10−7(M s)−1
(25 C and 1M ionic strength) gives . 5
[5, 6, 7, 8]. These results can be expected to be rather
trustworthy, because they are, as expected, similar to
the rate of a closely related and well understood system,
Coen3+/2+
10−5(M s)−1[9].

Furthermore, an early but less inﬂuential measurement of
Co(N H3)2+/3+
in liquid N H3 (and hence not suﬀering
from hydrolysic side reactions) indicated a similar rate of
order 10−5(M s)−1[10].

Brieﬂy, previous results of theory mainly by Buhks
et al (1978) [11] and Newton (1986,1991) [8, 12] indi-
cate that the reaction involves the ground state species
low-spin Co(N H3)3+
6 , 1A1g [Co(III,S=0)], and high-
spin Co(N H )2+, 4T
[Co(II,S=3/2)]. The spin-excited

states, 3T1g [Co(III,S=1] and 2Eg [Co(II,S=1/2], were to
high in energy to be thermally populated. This led to
a spin-forbidden (only possible by weak spin-orbit cou-
pling), diabatic reaction with a rate constant of about 4
orders of magnitude too small compared to experiment.
However, work by Larsson et al (1985) stressed that the
ground state-excited state energy separations at the tran-
sition state have to be considered, not at the equilib-
rium geometries.
Including Jahn-Teller (JT) stabiliza-
tion energies for the excited states, this led in particular
to a substantial energetic lowering of Co(II,S=1/2) rela-
tive to Co(II,S=3/2). Although this made the reaction
spin-allowed, their work suﬀered from inconsistent data
from diﬀerent electronic structure codes. Furthermore,
the rate constant was not determined.

∼

In this paper we show that the thermal activation bar-
rier for the spin-allowed reaction between Co(III,S=0)
and Co(II,S=1/2) [total spin S in units of ~] is drastically
lowered (
6.9kcal/mol) compared to the spin-forbidden
reaction between Co(III,S=0) and Co(II,S=3/2). Un-
like previously believed, the JT-distorted spin-excited
Co(II,S=1/2) and the ground state Co(II,S=3/2) are
near degenerate. Hence the reaction is spin-allowed and
adiabatic. Our results are based on the density functional
theory (DFT)[13] code SIESTA[14] which we use to cal-
culate spin-excited states of isocharge molecular species
and potential energy surfaces (PESs). Since DFT is a
ground state theory, excitation energies obtained from
ground state energy diﬀerences of species with diﬀerent
total spin are expected to be rather good. The DFT
method has the advantage over Hartree-Fock methods
that certain correlations are already build in. From
the PESs we determine the activation barrier and pro-
vide a new estimate of the rate constant utilizing pre-

II. REVIEW OF PREVIOUS EFFORTS

In this section further experimental facts about the
single complexes and a more detailed review of past the-
oretical eﬀorts are presented.

It is well accepted that Co(N H3)3+
6

[Co(III)] is a sta-
ble low-spin (S=0) compound, while it is assumed that
Co(N H3)2+
[Co(II)] is high-spin (S=3/2). There are sev-
6
eral reasons for this. First it is known from 59 Co NMR
studies that the related system, Co(H2O)3+
6 , shows no
sign of exchange with paramagnetic species[15] and hence
is low-spin. This is also expected to be true for Co(III),
since it has an even larger ligand-ﬁeld favoring low-spin.
X-ray diﬀraction data of related crystals shows further a
0.22˚A
drastic diﬀerence of the Co-N bond distances (
[5, 16]) between Co(II) and Co(III). From this it was
concluded that the ligand-ﬁeld of Co(II) must be much
smaller resulting in high-spin. Additionally, the optical
excitation spectrum of Co(III) could be fully character-
d spin-forbidden transitions. This is
ized including d
diﬀerent than Co(II), where it could not be measured suc-
cessfully. It is further experimentally supported that the
Co(N H3)2+/3+
self-exchange reaction occurs as outer-
sphere. This is due to a rather slow ligand exchange rate
of Co(III). There is considerable thermodynamic and ki-
netic stability, which arises from eﬀective σ-donation into
empty eg-shells[17].

coupling or thermal population at ﬁnite temperature T,
(2) and (4) are mainly due to mixing of the electronic eg-
orbitals of Co(II) and Co(III) mediated by their ligands
when a precursor state is formed.

It has been known for about 50 years that extraordi-
narily slow rates can often be attributed to small Franck-
Condon nuclear overlaps. These originate from large
changes in the metal-ligand bond length in the ﬁrst coor-
dination sphere[19]. This seemed to apply also to the case

at hand, if one assumes an adiabatic reaction (κel ≈

tailed theoretical study by E. Buhks and co-workers us-
ing perturbation theory in the weak spin-orbit coupling
to admix spin-excited states shows that the electronic

Orgel[20] and by Stynes and Ibers[21] put out an
idea that the reaction could involve thermally excited
Co(II,S=1/2) making it spin-allowed. Larsson et al [22]
went further and argued that the excited states can be-
come much lower in energy near TS. The important quan-
tities are the energy diﬀerence between ﬁrst excited state
and ground state of Co(II) and Co(III) as a function of
the Co-N bond length r

In the case of Co(III) the lowering enhances some-
what the admixture to the ground state, while in case
of Co(II), 2Eg becomes even lower than 1A1g circum-
venting the spin-barrier. Their argument is based on
Born-Oppenheimer potential energy surfaces (PES) cal-
culated both with ab initio Hartree-Fock (HF) and semi-
empirical INDO-CI methods including eg JT eﬀects for
both excited states. Unfortunately their result was not
convincing, since the HF calculation predicts the wrong
ground state for Co(III), while the INDO-CI excitation
3, 000 cm−1 was much lower
energy ∆E2+
−
than the generally believed 9, 000 cm−1[11], although
there is no experimental evidence for this value. There
has been no absorption found in this region. On the
other hand, the excitation energy of Co(III) is known
from experiment to be 13,700 cm−1[23] at the Co(III)
equilibrium conﬁguration. Since their calculated value
|equ = 14, 800 cm−1 is too large by an amount

It was noted that the semi-empirical INDO-CI method
is generally very successful
in calculating spectra of
transition-metal complexes at ﬁxed geometries, but not
so in predicting molecular geometries[24].

In 1991, Newton carried out new ab initio calcula-
tions at both the SCF(UHF) and correlated (UMP2)
level. Using an empirical correction factor as large as
6, 000 cm−1 (HF generally favors high-spin), he es-
c =
timated the excitation energies at the transition state to
be ∆E3+ = 8, 800 cm−1 and ∆E2+ = 5, 300 cm−1, and
concluded that thermally excited pathways are not com-
petitive to the spin-forbidden ground state pathway at
room temperature (RT). This left the problem unsolved.

III. AB INITO CALCULATIONS

A. Method

Our results of the inner-sphere activation barrier are
based on PESs obtained from the fully ab initio code
SIESTA[14] based on density functional theory (DFT).
SIESTA uses Troullier-Martins norm-conserving pseudo
potentials[25] in the Kleinman-Bylander form[26]. For
cobalt, we included spin-polarization and non-linear core
corrections[27] to account for a spin-dependent exchange
splitting and correlation eﬀects between core and valence
electrons, respectively. Relativistic eﬀects are included
for the core electrons in the usual scalar-relativistic ap-
proximation (mass-velocity and Darwin terms) and by
averaging over spin-orbit coupling terms, while no spin-
orbit coupling is included for the 4s and 3d valence elec-
trons. This has the computational advantage that spin
remains a good quantum number, while resulting errors

3

of the total energy are less crucial when one is inter-
ested in total energy diﬀerences. SIESTA uses a local
basis set of pseudo atomic orbitals (PAO) of multiple ζ-
type. The ﬁrst-ζ orbitals are produced by the method
by Sankey and Niklewski[28], while the higher-ζ orbitals
are obtained from the split valence method well known
from quantum chemistry. Polarization orbitals can also
be included. We used a double-ζ basis set with polar-
ization orbitals (DZP), as well as the generalized gra-
dient approximation (GGA) in the version by Perdew,
Burke and Ernzerhof[29] for the exchange-correlation en-
ergy functional. The charge densities are calculated on a
real space grid, where the ﬁneness of the grid corresponds
to an energy cut-oﬀ 80 Ry.

Before going into the details of how we obtained the
PESs plots, we outline the main ingredients of our calcu-
lations.

•

•

•

Our calculations rest on the ﬁxed-spin method
within the spin-polarized DFT frame work. Two
diﬀerent Fermi energies, one for spin-up and one
for spin-down, are adjusted in a self-consistent way
in order to obtain the ground state of a desired to-
tal spin. If a ground state of a certain spin is higher
than the ground state of a diﬀerent spin, then we
know the former as the excited state and the lat-
ter one as the true ground state. Nevertheless,
there might be several states within a spin-manifold
which diﬀer in orbital symmetry. Since the DFT
method is based on the variational principle, we
obtain the state of a system with a certain total
spin which has the lowest energy[30]. Our excita-
tion energies are extracted from total energy diﬀer-
ences using the well-established self-consistent-ﬁeld
method (∆SCF)[31]. This gives generally reliable
results for molecules since ﬁnal state eﬀects are in-
cluded.

The ammines are treated as rigid bodies, i.e. the
N-H bond lengths and the H-N-H bond angles
stay the same throughout all our calculations.
This is justiﬁed, since the vibrational frequencies
of covalent bonds (N-H) are about one order of
magnitude higher than the metal-ligand stretching
frequencies[6] and are considered average values.

We perform geometrical conjugate gradient opti-
mizations (CGOs) of both Co(II) and Co(III) with
the spin being ﬁxed to a desired value. This is
used to obtain the equilibrium geometries (EQ-
GEOs) and the PES. The EQGEOs are optimized
or relaxed geometries, where the forces on cobalt
and all the ammines are below the chosen toler-
ance 0.01eV /˚A. As for the PESs calculations, we
constrain the maximum size of a CG step to be
0.001˚A in order to provide a large sequence of en-
ergies. The resulting total energy can subsequently
be plotted as a function of the Co-N bond length
averaged over the six ligands. In the case of JT dis-
tortions, the average Co-N bond length in the axial

direction, rax, and the average Co-N bond length
in the equatorial plane, req, are more reasonable
choices.

B. Calculation of potential energy surfaces

In the following we describe the procedure of how we

obtained the PES plots in ﬁgures 2 and 3.

Figure 2 shows the ground state (S=0) and excited
state (S=1) PESs of Co(III). For the ground state PES
we started a CGO at the Co(II,S=3/2) EQGEO, de-
noted as starting point (1), but with the spin ﬁxed to
S=0 and charge +3e. For the excited state PES (S=1)
we started CGOs at both the EQGEOs of Co(III,S=0),
starting point (2), and Co(II,S=3/2) (not shown for clar-
ity). The vertical arrow indicates the optical excitation
energy from the Co(III,S=0) EQGEO, where it is as-
sumed that the excited state is initially not JT distorted,
since the excitation is almost instantaneous. The dotted
line in ﬁgure 2 corresponds to total energy versus the
average Co-N bond length. Since Co(III,S=1) is JT un-
stable, we also plot the total energy versus the average
axial Co-N bond length, rax, and the average equato-
rial Co-N bond length, req, shown by dashed lines. One
can see that essentially only req changes when starting a
CGO from the Co(III,S=0) EQGEO.

In order to obtain smooth PESs it is essential to treat
the ammines as rigid bodies.
If one relaxes all the
atoms, the resulting PES would be much more compli-
the PES would display a sequence of short
cated, i.e.
parabolic curves stemming from periods of contracting
or stretching the N-H bond lengths, or from changing
the H-N-H angles. The resulting PES would not resem-
ble smooth parabola-like curves (at least for the non-
JT distorted ground states) anymore, since the reaction
coordinate would not simply be the change of the Co-
N bond length. Although equilibrium energies of the
constraint complexes might be higher than the all-atom-
relaxed ones, this is not a problem, since we are interested
in energy diﬀerences and ﬁnally in the sum of the Co(II)
and Co(III) system energies (overall energy shift which
does not aﬀect the rate).

Figure 3 shows the ground state S=3/2 and excited
state S=1/2 PESs of Co(II) as a function of the Co-
N bond length averaged over all six ligands. Using
an analogue procedure, the Co(II,S=3/2) PES results
from a CGO starting at the Co(III,S=0) EQGEO, (1),
where we have ﬁxed the spin at S=3/2 and the charge
at +2e. The dotted line shows the Co(II,S=1/2) PES,
which was obtained from starting at the non-JT distorted
Co(III,S=0) and Co(II,S=3/2) EQGEOs, (2) and (3) re-
spectively. They stay non-JT distorted. The vertical
arrow indicates the optical excitation to the non-JT dis-
torted Co(II,S=1/2) state. Starting geometry (4) is JT
distorted and hence lower in energy than (1). Further re-
laxation with the CGO method (dashed curve) lowers the
energy drastically by up to 7.7kcal/mol compared to the

Table II compares theoretical and experimental optical

excitation energies. The excitation energy 2Eg ←
for Co(N H3)2+
is not known from experiment but is
6
very important. If this energy separation is low enough
Co(II,S=1/2) is well-populated at ambient temperatures
and the electron transfer reaction is spin-allowed. Al-
though absolute excited state energies from DFT cannot
be trusted, trends established from DFT are often cor-
rect. From table II we can obtain the following. Since
DFT underestimates optical gaps such as the Dq ligand-
ﬁeld, DFT favors high-spin compounds. For instance, the
ligand-ﬁeld splitting of Co(III) is 274 kJ/mol[35] while
SIESTA gives 246 kJ/mol. In other words, excitations
from low-spin to high-spin (3T1g ←
1Ag) are under-
estimated while excitations from high-spin to low-spin
6A1g) are overestimated. Sim-
(2Eg ←
ilar results were found for singlet-triplet gaps of phenyl-
nitrene and other hypovalent systems[36].

4T1g and 4T1g ←

Unfortunately, in the case of low-spin to high-spin exci-
tations there is only one reliable value for Co(III) and no
experimental value available for Co(H2O)3+
in order to
6
conﬁrm the trend. Nevertheless, we can easily see that
the calculated gap for Co(H2O)3+
(7, 150cm−1) has to
6
be a lower bound analogous to Co(III). The argument is
as follows. From ligand-ﬁeld theory the excitation energy
1Ag is additive in the ligand ﬁeld Dq, which is
3T1g ←
about 25% larger for N H3 compared to H2O[22]. Taking
a value Dq = 274kJ/mol for Co(III) [35] and 200kJ/mol
for Co(H2O)3+
[37], we can correct the excitation energy
6
of Co(III), 13, 700cm−1, by the Dq-diﬀerence and obtain
an approximate value for Co(H2O)3+
6 , 7, 500cm−1. This
is clearly higher than the calculated value 7, 150cm−1.
Having this trend established we can conclude that the
4T1g of Co(N H3)2+
6 , 3, 680cm−1, is an
excitation 2Eg ←
upper bound on the real value.

A further conﬁrmation of the quality of our excitation
energy of Co(II) comes from the fact that our value is sim-
4, 100cm−1 after
ilar to Larsson’s with INDO-CI (3, 100
applying correction Eq. (6)[22]). According to ﬁgure 3,

the JT distorted Co(II,S=1/2) equilibrium energy is only
slightly higher than the non-JT distorted Co(II,S=3/2)
equilibrium energy. Since the S=1/2 PESs are likely
too high by a constant energy shift, Co(II,S=1/2) could
be close to degenerate with Co(II,S=3/2) or even be
the true ground state. Note that these considerations
do not include multiplet-spitting due to spin-orbit cou-

energy diﬀerence at the spin-forbidden transition state.
The excited state Co(III, S=1) is always much too
high in energy to be relevant and is not important
for further consideration. However, the value and sign
of ∆E2+(r†) decides whether the process will be
(!)
spin-forbidden (allowed by weak spin-orbit coupling)
(∆E2+ > 0), or whether it is spin-allowed (∆E2+ < 0).
The former process can be described by second order per-
turbation theory[6, 8, 12] using Co(II,S=1/2) as an vir-
tually excited state coupled to at the spin-forbidden TS,
the latter one is through direct coupling and does not
involve spin-orbit coupling[22]. As one can see our value
is ∆E2+(r†) < 0 and hence the reaction along the lowest
energy pathway is spin-allowed.

Figure 4 shows the PES of the total 2 Co-system, i.e.
the sum of the single complex energies. The minimum
in the left top corner at (rL = 2.03˚A, rR = 2.22˚A) corre-
sponds to equilibrium CoL(III)CoR(II), where the sub-
scripts L and R stand for “left” and “right” , respectively,
and simply distinguish the two complexes. The minimum
in the right bottom corner at (rL = 2.22˚A, rR = 2.03˚A)
corresponds to equilibrium CoL(II)CoR(III). The vari-
ables rL and rR are the Co-N bond lengths of the left and
right complex. For simplicity we can only show the non-
JT distorted complexes, since a single JT distorded com-
plex depends on two variables, rax and req. This would
resolve in a total energy which depends on more than
two variables and cannot be plotted. Part A is plotted
using the ground state Co(III,S=0) (solid line in Fig. 2)
and Co(II,S=1/2) for Co(II)-N bond length r2 < 2.125˚A
(dotted line in Fig. 3) and Co(II,S=3/2) for r2 > 2.125˚A
(solid line in Fig. 3). This is an example (by not includ-
ing JT distorted complexes of lower energy) of a spin-
allowed reaction. However, if we restricted ourselves to
the Oh group, this would be the lowest energy pathway.
Such a reaction starts out at equilibrium CoL(II, S =
3/2)CoR(III, S = 0), then activated by thermal ﬂuctu-
ations changes to the CoL(II, S = 1/2)CoR(III, S = 0)
PES at (rL = 2.125˚A, rR = 2.03˚A) through spin-orbit
coupling in only ﬁrst order (presumably adiabatic). Com-
ing back to ﬁgure 4, part B shows the PES of Co(III,S=0)
and Co(II,S=3/2) and hence describes the conventional
spin-forbidden reaction with an energetically higher tran-
sition state.

In the following we have to obtain the activation bar-
rier of the reaction.
In ﬁgure 5 the transition states
for spin-allowed (lower graph) and spin-forbidden (up-
per graph) are plotted. The graphs are the cross-section
of the 2Co-PES from ﬁgures 4 A and B along the diago-
nal r := rL = rR, i.e. E(rL = r, rR = r) = ECo(III)(r) +
ECo(II)(r), where the Co-N bond lengths rL and rR are
the bond lengths of the “left” and “right” complex. The
transition state is deﬁned as the saddle point. Using
non-JT distorted Co(II,S=1/2) leads to a lowering of the
spin-forbidden transition state by 0.3eV = 6.92kcal/mol.
The spin-allowed and spin-forbidden TSs are at r = 2.05
and 2.1˚A, respectively.
In the next section we use the
spin-allowed activation barrier to estimate the hexaam-

Finally a few things are important to keep in mind.
Application of the DFT method to transition metal ions
is tricky, even more when one is interested in excited
states. There are several well-known deﬁciencies one has
to consider. First, it is well known that DFT suﬀers from
insuﬃciently treating certain correlation eﬀects[38]. This

concerns mainly the localized d-orbitals of cobalt, where
d Coulomb interaction introduces local corre-
the large d
lations that are not captured properly by the GGA func-
tional. The second deﬁciency concerns optical gaps which
are generally underestimated[38, 39, 40]. In our case the
excited states involve the ligand-ﬁeld spitting. This, how-
ever, is turned to our advantage by using it to deduce a
trend. It is utilized in the next section to obtain an essen-
tial lower bound on the rate constant. More importantly,
since DFT is a ground state theory, we expect that ex-
citation energies obtained from total energy diﬀerences
(∆SCF method) are rather reliable. Very good results
have been obtained for optical spin (singlet-triplet)[41]
and charge[42] excitations. Furthermore, total energies
are expected to be better for strongly σ-donating N H3
than for weakly π-donating H2O ligands, because the
N H3 ligands are less electro-negative and bind more co-
valently with cobalt eg orbitals. Covalent molecular-type
systems are well described by the DFT method. Besides,
covalency screens the on-site repulsion of the localized
d-orbitals reducing correlation eﬀects.

In this section we give an estimate for the hexaam-
mine self-exchange rate using previously estimated elec-
tron transfer parameters and results from last section.
For now, we take the energies obtained from the DFT
calculations literally. For instance, we assume that high-
spin Co(II,S=3/2) is the groundstate according to our
calculation (see Fig. 3). However, since DFT stabilizes
high-spin Co(II,S=3/2) over low-spin Co(II,S=1/2) ac-
cording to our trend, this rate estimate is a lower bound.
This is because we ﬁrst have to thermally excite to the re-
action intermediate, Co(II,S=1/2), which lowers the rate.
With regard to our trend, Co(II,S=1/2) could be the true
groundstate.

The initial rate constant to the intermediate state
Co(II,S=1/2)Co(III,S=0) is denoted by ki.
In ther-
mal equilibrium the return reaction with rate constant
k−i back to the groundstate Co(II,S=3/2)Co(III,S=0) is
equal to ki. From the intermediate state the spin-allowed
electron transfer can occur with rate constant ket

CoL(II, S = 3/2)CoR(III, S = 0)

CoL(II, S = 1/2)CoR(III, S = 0)
CoL(III, S = 0)CoR(II, S = 1/2)

.

(7)

The resulting total rate constant is k. Since the two steps
from Eq. 7 are incoherent due to relaxization along the
surfaces, the total rate k can equivalently be described as
starting out at the thermally populated (with probabil-
ity P) intermediate, CoL(II, S = 1/2)CoR(III, S = 0),
from were the spin-allowed electron transfer can occur to
CoL(III, S = 0)CoR(II, S = 1/2) with rate ket. This
does not require rate constant ki. Hence, the total spin-
allowed reaction rate constant is

k = P ket =

Co(II,S=1/2) and Co(II,S=3/2) are nearly degen-
erate, i.e Co(II,S=1/2) is slightly higher in energy
than Co(II,S=3/2) but is probably overestimated.
In order to get a lower bound of the rate we hy-
pothetically trust the DFT energies and calculate
∆G∗ = 0.3kcal/mol + kBT ln(12/4) = 3.1kcal/mol
from the energy and the entropy diﬀerences be-
tween Co(II,S=1/2) and Co(II,S=3/2). Hence, the
prefactor of equation (8) is 0.09 using the degen-
eracies g from ﬁgure 1 and neglecting multiplet-
splitting.

•

The TS of the Co(II,S=1/2)Co(III,S=0) system
is lower than the TS of Co(II,S=3/2)Co(III,S=0).
The inner-sphere contribution to the activation
barrier, the energy diﬀerence of the 2 Co-system be-
tween the TS and equilibrium using Co(II,S=1/2),
is only E†
in = 0.42eV = 9.69kcal/mol. For the
equilibrium energy of Co(II,S=1/2), we take the JT
distorted value, for TS we use the non-JT distorted
one. This seems reasonable, because the acceptor,
Co(III,S=0), is non-JT distorted. In order to have
suﬃcient nuclear overlap, the donor should be non-
JT distorted at TS, too.

The other parameters are only slightly modiﬁed. This
is mainly due to using a diﬀerent nuclear frequency for
Co(II), i.e. ν2(Eg) for Co(II,S=1/2) instead of ν2(A1g)
for Co(II,S=3/2):

We neglect entropy contributions, which are quite small
for water near room temperature[43] and vanish for the
inner-sphere system, if the (harmonic) vibrations are the

In the following, we again want to stress the main dif-
ferences between our treatment of a spin-allowed process
and the conventional spin-forbidden reaction by Buhks
et al. and Newton[8]. The main diﬀerence is that in
our case the low-spin Co(II,S=1/2) complex has a lower
energy than the high-spin Co(II,S=3/2) near the TS as
opposed to Buhks et al. and Newton.
In their case,
the spin excited state Co(II,S=1/2) is much higher in
energy and is only virtually coupled to by weak spin-
orbit coupling. This leads to extremely small rates of
order 10−10(M s)−1. In table IV we show for further il-
lustration the individual parameters used to calculate the
rate according to Eqs. (2) and (8) and compare to New-
ton’s spin-forbidden and hence diabatic groundstate reac-
tion and thermally excited adiabatic pathway. The spin-
forbidden reaction is signiﬁcantly lowered by the weak
spin-orbit coupling (κel << 1), while the excited alterna-
tive is thermally not accessible and leads to even smaller

10−3(M s)−1, and the experimental rate, 5

At this point, there are two main possibilities why
there is a 2 order of magnitude disagreement between
our, 6
·
10−5(M s)−1. Either something is not correct with the
theoretical estimate, or the experimental rate constant
is too small.
In the more likely case that the theory
misses some details, the sources of possible errors are the
4T1g excitation energy and hence the prefactor
2Eg ←
of Eq. (8). Increasing the energy of the Co(II,S=1/2)
PESs w.r.t. Co(II,S=3/2) by a constant energy shift
2, 560cm−1 and hence increasing the excitation energy
to 6, 240cm−1, produces the experimental value. This,
however, is in conﬂict with the trend of excitation ener-
gies established from the DFT method.

originate from a more complicated cross-over from the
JT distorted Co(II,S=1/2) equilibrium complex to ther-
mally excited non-JT distorted Co(II,S=1/2) near TS.
The cross-over could be rather unlikely, since the sym-
metry changes.

On the other hand, possible experimental issues are
beyond our realm of knowledge. Although a diﬃcult ex-
periment, it has been thoroughly studied over decades.
Nevertheless, generally forgotten, neglected or underes-
timated side-reactions lead to an underestimation of the
rate constant. In particular, the existence of high-spin
Co(II,S=3/2) is challenged by our analysis. This leads to
the question, if the assumption of high-spin Co(II,S=3/2)
was wrongly made when deriving certain rates of side-
reactions. Having said this, an error of about 2 orders of
magnitude in the rate estimate is not as bad as it may
sound. Due to the activated nature of the reaction, the
exponential dependence of the rate on the activation bar-
rier and excitation energy makes it very sensitive to small
errors.

VI. CONCLUSION

Within Marcus theory of charge transfer the rate
constant of the hexaamminecobalt-self-exchange reac-
tion was redetermined. We utilized the DFT code
SIESTA to calculate Born-Oppenheimer potential en-
ergy surfaces and spin-excitation energies and use pre-
viously determined parameters. The main diﬀerences
from former work is the near degeneracy of Co(II,S=3/2)
and Co(II,S=1/2). Furthermore, we observed a dras-
6.9kcal/mol)
tic lowering of the activation barrier (

·

for the reaction pathway involving and Co(III,S=0) and
Co(II,S=1/2). This led to a rate constant of order
10−3(M s)−1 which is 2 orders of magnitude faster
6
than experiment. Possible sources of errors are out-
lined in section V and having most likely to do with
the neglect of the proper cross-over treatment from
Jahn-Teller distorted equilibrium Co(II,S=1/2) to non-
Jahn-Teller distorted Co(II,S=1/2) near the transition
state. The good quality of our energetics involved in
the rate constant evaluation is indicated, ﬁrst because
our calculated excitation energy 13, 230cm−1 of Co(III),
3T1g ←
1Ag, agrees well with the experimental value
13, 700cm−1. Second, our excitation energy 3, 680cm−1
4T1g, is close to Larsson’s value from
of Co(II), 2Eg ←
4, 100cm−1). This energy is in par-
INDO-CI (3, 100
−
ticular important for charge transfer. Unfortunately,
the corresponding optical absorption peak could not be
found experimentally. This may simply be explained
by the spin-forbiddeness and vibrational broadening be-
cause of diﬀerences in equilibrium Co-N bond distances
and a Jahn-Teller unstable excited state. On the other
hand, our analysis questions the existence of the high-
spin ground state Co(II,S=3/2) and hence can provide
an alternative explanation for the absence the the ab-
sorption peak.

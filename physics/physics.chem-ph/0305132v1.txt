The classical limit of the Wigner-Weyl representation is used to approximate products of bound-
continuum matrix elements that are fundamental to many coherent control computations. The range
of utility of the method is quantiﬁed through an examination of model problems, single-channel Na2
dissociation and multi-arrangement channel photodissociation of CH2IBr. Very good agreement
with the exact quantum results is found for a wide range of system parameters.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Recent experimental and theoretical developments show that coherent control, i.e. the control of atomic and
molecular dynamics via quantum interference, can be successfully applied to the wide variety of systems [1]. However,
available quantum methods limit theoretical studies to scattering and photodissociation of small molecules. The
extension of theoretical studies to larger complex chemical systems must rely on new developments in quantum or
semiclassical techniques. Primary amongst these is the application of the Initial Value Representation semiclassical
approach that is described elsewhere [2, 3]. However, the ultimate utility of such techniques requires the development
of numerical tools to speed convergence of the initial value integrals with highly oscillatory integrands.

In this paper we consider an approach to computing interference contributions in coherent control in which such
oscillations do not occur. Speciﬁcally, we focus attention on using the classical limit of Wigner Phase Space Methods[4,
5], where the desired transition matrix elements products are written in the Wigner-Weyl representation and the
quantum expressions are replaced by their classical counterparts. This approach has been applied in the past to a
number of simpler problems[6, 7] where transitions from one initial bound state were considered, e.g., from a single
vibrational state [6] or from a Gaussian state [8, 9]. In these cases only absolute values squared of matrix elements
were sought. By contrast, in this paper we use a result [10] on the classical limit of the nonstationary Liouville
eigenstates to obtain the classical limit of the desired product of transition dipole matrix elements, a quantity which,
in general, includes phase information. For example, we demonstrate that the method gives good results for complex
valued matrix elements that arise in the multi-arrangement photodissociation of CH2IBr to CH2I + Br or CH2Br
+ I. The method has also been previously applied in the guise of the linearized approximation to the Initial Value
Representation[11] with varying degrees of success.

This paper is organized as follows. The classical limit of the Wigner phase space method is described in Section
II. Applications of the method to simple systems involving one arrangement channel are described in Section III.
Speciﬁcally, we consider Franck-Condon transitions for the model case of excitations from a harmonic oscillator
potential to a linear potential and to transitions on realistic Na2 potential energy surfaces. Section IV discusses
applications to collinear photodissociation of CH2IBr, where the transitions probabilities are complex because the
relevant operators are no longer Hermitian. Section V provides a summary of results.

II. METHOD

In various coherent control scenarios (e.g., bichromatic control [12] or coherent control via pulse sequencing [13])

control is dictated (here written for the case of non-rotating diatomics) by interference terms of the form

terms in computing the probability P (E)
interference to obtain control over molecular outcomes, the evaluation of terms like those in Eq. (1) are vital to
computational control studies.

results for n = 0 agree very well with those in Ref.
[6], and with the n = m = 1 results for β = 6 a.u., ω = 1 a.u.
(not shown). However, as is evident from Fig. 1, the accuracy of the classical Wigner approximation deteriorates
extremely rapidly with increasing n; results are very poor even for n = 4. The same behavior is observed for cases
where n
= m, shown in Fig. 1(c)-(d) for (n = 1, m = 0) and (n = 5, m = 4). This is because for small n, ρn,n
is smooth and broad, and the transition integral averages over many of Airy function oscillations. By contrast, for
large n, ρn,n is highly oscillatory and the initial state probes ﬁne details of the Airy functions which are absent in the
classical approximation. As is evident from Fig. 1(b), the classical Wigner results for n = m are negative at some
points. This is impossible physically and indicative of errors in the approximation. In the n
= m case, where negative
values are possible [Fig. 1(c)-(d)], the positions of maxima in the semiclassical approximations are shifted to lower
energies, a feature previously explained for the n = m case [6, 9].

Results presented in Fig. 1 were obtained for µ = 1 a.u. which is highly non-classical system. The dependence of
the classical-quantum agreement on the oscillator frequency ω and on the reduced mass µ are explored, for two cases
with m = n, in Fig. 2. Agreement is seen to improve dramatically as ω decreases and somewhat as µ decreases. The
latter result is surprising, motivating the analysis described below.

Characteristic sn factor. The validity of the classical Wigner approximation for cases where n = m and for the
excited state linear potential has been examined in Ref. [8]. There, the utility of the Wigner phase space approximation
for an initial Gaussian wavefunction was shown to depend upon two parameters, s and λ:

oscillations have shorter wavelength), and ∆ is the width of the initial Gaussian ground state:

Speciﬁcally, Eckhardt and coworkers [9] have shown that the smaller the s, the more accurate the classical approxima-
tion, consistent with the fact that smaller s means more Airy oscillations over the width ∆. However, the parameter s,
as deﬁned in Eq. (23), is not as useful in our case since we consider assorted ground state vibrational wave functions,
and not just simple Gaussians. Speciﬁcally, s was unable to predict the correct dependence of the classical-quantum
agreement on µ or ω. This is because for any oscillator, the width of the vibrational state ∆ depends on both µ and
ω, whereas Eq. (23) only allows for a dependence on µ via λ.

FIG. 2: Comparison between the classical Wigner (solid line) and exact quantum (dashed line) results for σn,m(E − E0)
(n = m = 4) for ﬁxed µ =1 a.u.: (a) ω = 2.0; (b) ω = 0.2; and for ﬁxed ω =2 a.u.: (c) µ = 1.0; (d) µ = 100.0.

Further, to account for the oscillatory character of the nth wavefunction on the lower potential surface, ∆ is replaced
by ∆n, where ∆n equals the width at half-maximum of a single oscillation of the ground state wavefunction. This
2(n + 1/2)¯h/µω is the overall width of the ground state wavefunction,
is given by ∆n = l/2(n + 1), where l = 2
estimated as the distance between the two classical turning points. This gives the new parameter sn:

(27)

It follows from Eq. (27) that the smaller the s is for n = m = 0, the better the classical approximation for higher-lying
levels. However, sn will always increase with increasing n due to the decreasing wavelength of the bound wavefunction.
Further, decreasing the vibrational frequency of the lower electronic state ω leads to wider vibrational states (and
larger ∆ in Eq. (23) for the Gaussian ground state) and, therefore, to the smaller s and better agreement with
quantum result. This explains the results shown in Fig. 2(a)-(b), where the corresponding values of s for two ω values
are 0.62 (s4 = 1.03) and 0.20 (s4 = 0.3), respectively. Alternatively, note that for smaller ω, the density ρn,m becomes
wider in q and the overlap integral in Eq. (11) averages over more Airy function oscillations. Increasing the slope of
the upper potential also leads to better agreement between the classical Wigner and quantum results in accord with
Eq. (26), reﬂecting the fact that the Airy function oscillates more with increasing β [Eq. (21)]. Further, Eq. (26)
and Eq. (27) quantify the dependence on reduced mass µ that is evident in Fig. 2(c)-(d) where corresponding values
of parameter s for the two increasing values of µ are 0.62 and 1.33, respectively. This is because, while λ in Eq. (23)
decreases with increasing µ, the width of the initial state ∆ does so as well.

Characteristic sn,m factor. In the case of n

= m, developing the corresponding parameter sn,m is more diﬃcult.
However, in accord with sn, the quantity sn,m is expected to be the ratio of a characteristic width on the excited
state divided by a width on the ground state. To obtain sn,m we make the following observations: (1) The width
lm = 2
2(m + 1/2)¯h/µω of the product φnφm can be deﬁned by the width of the narrower of the two states m, with
0 outside that interval; (2) the total number of relevant nodes of
m < n, where φn is given by Eq. (17), since φm →
the product φnφm is n′ + m′, where n′ and m′ are the number of zeroes of the nth and mth states within the interval
lm. Further, the quantity m′ = m since lm is the overall width of the mth harmonic oscillator state and n′ can be

As expected, for n = m, sn,n = sn.

The behavior of the results in Fig. 1 can now be quantiﬁed in terms of sn and sn,m. In particular, we obtain
s = 0.62, s4 = 1.03, s1,0 = 0.67,
the following values of sn and sn,m for the results presented in the ﬁgures: s0 ≡
and s5,4 = 1.08. One can see that s is already larger than 1 (fast diverging series; see Table 1 in [8]) for n = 4.
Additional computations show that s4,0 = 0.83 and the approximation works reasonably well in this case. Similar
0.83, e.g.,
good agreement has been obtained for three diﬀerent pairs of n and m which are characterized by sn,m ≈
(n, m) = (4,0), (3,1), and (2,2). However, in all cases where sn,m > 1 (e.g.,
1.12 for (n, m) = (8,2), (7,3), and (5,5)),
the agreement is poor (not shown).

B. Molecules

To apply this to realistic systems, consider ﬁrst a linear potential model of the dissociation of the H2 molecule.
In this case µ is increased and the ground state ω is decreased relative to the system studied above. In particular,
1 [17]. σ results for four pairs of n and m are shown in Fig. 3 for β =
µ = 918.7 a.u. and ω = ωe = 4395.2 cm−
6: n = m = 4, n = m = 20, n = 5, m = 4, and n = 21, m = 12. The results clearly show much better agreement
between exact Franck-Condon and classical results than does the case studied above. Indeed, the diﬀerence between
the classical and exact quantum results becomes visible only at high-lying levels, n = m = 20. Furthermore, this
diﬀerence becomes practically indiscernible for the even heavier molecule Na2, µ = 20953.9 a.u. ω = ωNa2 = 158.91
1 [18], where virtually perfect agreement between exact and approximate results is obtained even for n = 20 (not
cm−
shown). Using Eq. (26) we obtain the corresponding values of parameter s: s[5] = 0.62 (i.e., the parameters are
those of Ref. [6] and used in Section IV.A above), sH2 = 0.19, and sNa2 = 0.06, in accord with the computed results.
Similarly, the excellent agreement obtained for the high n and m values for model H2 and Na2 is consistent with the
values of sn and sn,m. For example, s20= 0.197 for Na2 and s21,12 = 0.179. In the case of the H2 model s20 = 0.62
and we expect to see the diﬀerence between the classical and exact quantum results on a par with the one we have
s was also 0.62. This is indeed the case, as seen from a comparison of
seen for the case in Section IV.A where s0 ≡
Figs. 1 and 3. Note also that s21,12 = 0.57 in the case of the H2 model which leads to worse agreement than in the
Na2 case (s21,12 = 0.18) but much better than in the case in Section IV.A (s21,12 = 1.85) (not shown here).

To see the origin of this behavior, consider cuts through the ground and excited phase space distributions at ﬁxed
values p = 0 and E = E0, as shown in Fig. 4 for three diﬀerent systems: the model of Ref. [6], H2 and Na2. While

the quantum results correspond to taking the overlap between these two phase space densities, the classical limit
corresponds to using the value of the initial state phase space distribution at the coordinate q(p, E) (the vertical line
in Fig. 4 corresponds to the value q(p = 0, E = E0) = 0 for p = 0, E = ED). Clearly, this approximation improves
with decreasing s.

−

In an attempt to further improve these results, we considered the higher order quantum corrections (see Eq. (4.8),
[6]) to the classical Wigner result, which consist of additional terms in an expansion of the density of states
Ref.
ˆH)W in powers of ¯h. Our calculations using this expansion showed that although these corrections sometimes
δ(E
work well for the low-lying vibrational levels n < 2, they led to much poorer agreement with the exact results for
higher n, as the higher order terms became dominant, a result also noted in Ref.
[8]. As is evident from Fig. 5,
where the quantum corrected results are shown as dot-slashed curves, the quantum corrections are practically of no
use when n, m are > 0 even for a small value of s (sNa2 = 0.06). The results are equally bad for the other models and
are not shown here.

Consider now the case of a realistic model of Na2 [18] where both the upper and lower potentials are properly treated;
the b 13Πu to 13Πg transition has been chosen as an example. The results using the classical Wigner approximation
(solid line) and the uniform semiclassical approach (dashed line) are compared in Fig. 6(a)-(f). Here the classical
calculations were carried out using Eq. (15) with realistic Na2 potentials, whereas the semiclassical Franck-Condon
factors were obtained by numerically evaluating

that the classical Wigner representation works very well for the low-lying levels (n, m
5) of the initial electronic
state. The results for very high n and m are in poorer agreement and are not presented here. This is a direct
consequence of the use of the harmonic approximation for the ground state. Speciﬁcally, for n, m > 5, anharmonic
corrections to the ground state should be included in order to account for the delocalization of the ground state
wavefunctions [22].

V. MULTI-PRODUCT ARRANGEMENT CHANNELS

Consider now the multi-arrangement channel problem, i.e., the case where photodissociation results in the formation
AB + C. In this case our main focus is on obtaining

ABC

of two diﬀerent chemical products, e.g., A + BC
cross sections into speciﬁc channels.

←

Quantum mechanically the Hilbert space of a typical multi-arrangement channel scattering problem can be parti-

tioned as follows [14]:

Here, ˆI is the unit operator, ˆRr projects onto states that correlate asymptotically with all states in channel r, and ˆB
projects onto bound states. This allows the total σn,m(E) to be written as

ˆI =

ˆRr + ˆB.

The channel-speciﬁc cross section of interest in this section is given by Eq. (7) in the Franck-Condon approximation,

Classically, these operators Rr and B correspond to various types of classical trajectories that occur in photodis-
sociation: trajectories that start in the region of the excited polyatomic (upon excitation) and dissociate to the r
channels, and those that do not dissociate and remain bound.

Equation (41), in the Wigner representation, assumes the form

where z denotes all coordinates and momenta, q, p.

To evaluate the channel-speciﬁc cross section requires that we approximate the term [ ˆRrδ(E

ˆH)]W . In general,

the Wigner transform of the product of two operators admits a small ¯h expansion [23]

This form is more natural since the term that selects the channel, [ ˆRr]W (z), acts in the same manner on both terms
in the integral.

We can implement this channel selection as follows: we consider the trajectory that emanates from an initial point
= r, or is

n,m(E). Alternatively, it contributes to channel r′

z; if the trajectory ends in channel r it contributes to σ(r)
bound, both of which are ignored in the σ(r)
n,m computation.
Both the magnitude and phase of σ(r)

However, even though σ(r)
n,m(E) can have an imaginary component, the sum of the imaginary contributions over
all the channels must remain zero since σn,m(E) is real. For a two channel system, this implies that any imaginary
contribution in channel 1 must be equal in magnitude and opposite in sign to the imaginary contribution from channel
2. We further note that the diagonal σ(r)

and is therefore real.

Consider now the second term in Eq. (45). The derivatives of the delta function introduced via the Poisson bracket
result in the rapid oscillation of the integrand which, as we have veriﬁed numerically, yields a ﬁnal contribution to the
integral that is essentially zero. Therefore, we set the Poisson bracket term to zero, and the channel speciﬁc σ(r)

m = (m1, m2), where pi, qi denote the momenta and coordinates of the two degrees of freedom. The two dimensional

VI. APPLICATION TO CO2 AND CH2BRI

The method was ﬁrst applied to the photodissociation of collinear CO2. The coordinates are denoted R = rO
C, r =
O. The system is initially in the bound state Ψb(r, R), with equilibrium separation ¯xs = ¯R = ¯r = 2.20 a.u. The

rC
ground potential surface is harmonic in the normal mode coordinates xs and xa [24], with parameters:

−

xs = (R + r)/2; xa = (R

αs = ωsMs/¯h; αa = ωaMa/¯h.

r)/(2γ); γ = [1 + mC/(2mO)],

The two product channels are denoted OC+O (channel 1) and O+CO (channel 2). The coordinates q1 ≡

¯R = q1 + γq2.

The multidimensional integrals in Eqs. (52) and (55) for both this case as well as the case of CH2IBr discussed below
were carried out for all systems below using Monte Carlo box Muller transformation [27] and 106 trajectories. The
value of ǫ was chosen as ǫ = 5

Results for CO2 are shown in Figs. 7 and 8. Figure 7 compares the total cross section σ0000(E) calculated using
Eq. (52), computed with Rr(z) = 1, to results of a time dependent formalism utilizing the stationary phase Herman
Kluk (SPHK) propagator [25]. Trajectories in the SPHK procedure were followed only long enough to capture the
initial dispersion from the Franck-Condon region, giving the direct part of the cross section. Although the classical-
Wigner result is seen to be shifted slightly from the time dependent result, the method is seen to display the essential
features of the direct part of the photodissociation cross section. An analagous calculation by Eckhardt and H¨upper[9]
for water produced a result similar to that shown in Fig. 7.

Figure 9 shows the structure of the channel contributions to various cross sections and interference terms. Note
that, as required, for the case of the oﬀ-diagonal cross section σ(k)
1000(E) is interesting (cf. Fig. 9 ), even though the
two channels produce diﬀerent real parts, the imaginary parts in the two channels again sum to zero. The deviation
from zero is very small, indicating reliable convergence of the Monte Carlo sums.

Figures 10 and 11 show a comparison of the classical-Wigner method with a full quantum mechanical calculation.
The structure of the cross section in the channels is seen to be well reproduced the classical-Wigner method, providing

support for the conclusion that this approach gives reliable results for both the real and imaginary contribution.
Interestingly, the latter arises via the non-Hermitian character of ˆRrδ(E

ˆH).

Finally, Fig. 12 shows an example of the utility of larger values of ǫ in Eq. (51). Speciﬁcally, using larger values of

−

ǫ allows for a qualitative estimate of the desired integrals using far fewer trajectories.

Franck-Condon transitions onto a linear potential, along with the dependence of the method on parameters such as
system reduced mass, slope of the upper potential energy surface, and vibrational frequency of the lower electronic
state were examined. The results were found to be in excellent agreement when the newly introduced parameter
sn,m [Eq. (33)] was less than unity. A comparison of the classical and uniform semiclassical approximations for the
transitions between the realistic potential energy surfaces of Na2 demonstrates that higher values of m, n require use
of the anharmonic Wigner function for the ground state, an eﬀect not explored in this paper.

This approach was also applied to the multi-channel problem where interference terms are complex. In this case, the
result is still the overlap of two time-independent phase space densities, but determining the density associated with
a particular channel required evaluation using classical trajectories. The non-Hermitian character introduced by the
projection operator ˆRr onto channel r allowed for the successful reproduction of the entire complex term. We regard
it as particularly encouraging that use of classical trajectories in conjunction with the complex Wigner transform of
the term
suﬃces to produce the imaginary part of the interference contribution with such accuracy. We note,
however, that the method is not expected to produce resonance structures in the cross section, being most useful for
systems where the dynamics is direct and short-lived[8, 9, 11].

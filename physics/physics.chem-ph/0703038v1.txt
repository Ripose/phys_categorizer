Stark eﬀect is calculated by the perturbation theory method separately for the ortho and para
water molecules. At room temperature, a 30%-diﬀerence in the energy change is found for the
two species put in electric ﬁeld. This implies a sorting of the ortho and para water molecules in
non-uniform electric ﬁelds. The ortho/para water separation is suggested to occur in the course of
steam sorption on a solid surface and of large-scale atmospheric processes.

It is a textbook knowledge that an isolated water
molecule, H2O, exists in one of the two forms (spin iso-
mers), ortho or para, with parallel or antiparallel proton
spins, respectively [1]. In the ﬁrst case a total magnetic
moment of the molecule is 1, while in the second case
it is 0. Under ambient conditions the gaseous ortho and
para molecules are in a statistical 3:1 equilibrium (further
referred as the normal O/P-ratio). In the gas, the ortho-
para conversion due to collisions and radiation processes
is highly improbable [2]. The valuable factor of conver-
sion is magnetic interactions. In the absence of magnetic
impurities, the estimated life-time of the gaseous ortho
and para molecules is months [3]. Thus, the water vapor
is a true mixture of two gaseous ensembles consisting
of magnetic (ortho) and nonmagnetic (para) molecules.
This means that the ortho and para ensembles can in
principle be spatially separated.

For molecular hydrogen, the task of spatial separation
of the spin isomers has been solved decades ago [4]. At
present, the O/P separation of H2 is usually attained by
catalytically assisted cooling of gaseous H2 at cryogenic
temperatures. Separate existence of ortho and para wa-
ter, however, is still questionable. The challenge is to
pinpoint those physical properties of the chemically iden-
tical ortho and para water molecules, which can be used
for their separation. Here, by the perturbation theory
calculations we study response of the ortho and para wa-
ter molecules to the dc electric ﬁeld (Stark eﬀect), and
ﬁnd that these two species have noticeably diﬀerent elec-
trostatic properties. Although the study of Stark eﬀect
in water has a long history [1, 5], the eﬀect, to our knowl-
edge, has never been considered separately for the ortho
and para modiﬁcations.

As is generally accepted, we consider a water molecule
as a rigid asymmetrical top and choose the coordinate
system so that the ξ, η, ζ axes are directed along the three
main inertial axes of the molecule [1]. Further we follow a
standard procedure described in details in Ref. [6]. The
rotational part of Hamiltonian is written as:

where ˆJξ, ˆJη, ˆJζ are the angular momentum operators,
and IA, IB, IC are the main inertial moments of the
molecule. The symmetry of the Hamiltonian (1) belongs
to the D2 group, thus the rotational energy levels are
classiﬁed according to the irreducible representations of
this group: A, B1, B2 and B3. After rotation by π along
the ζ direction (Cπ(ζ)), the wave functions of the A and
B1 symmetries do not change their signs, while the wave
functions of the B2 and B3 symmetries do.

In the Born-Oppenheimer approximation and neglect-
ing the rotation-vibration interaction, the wave function
of water molecule is |Ψi = |ψsi · |ψeli · |ψvibri · |ψroti,
where |ψsi, |ψeli, |ψvibri, and |ψroti are the nuclear spin,
electronic, vibrational, and rotational wave functions.
According to the Pauli principle, the total Ψ-function
should change its sign after permutation of the hydro-
gen atoms. This permutation is equivalent to the Cπ(ζ)
rotation. The functions |ψeli and |ψvibri of the ground
state are symmetric with respect to Cπ(ζ). Whether or
not |ψroti and |ψsi change their signs, depends on in
which states, ortho or para, the water molecule is. Obvi-
ously, for the case of the parallel proton spins (the ortho
molecule) the exchange of the protons does not reverse
|ψsi. In this case, only |ψroti is responsible for the sign
inversion of the total Ψ-function. Therefore, |ψroti of the
ortho molecule has either B2 or B3 symmetries. In con-
trast, |ψsi of the para molecule does change the sign when
the protons (with antiparallel spins) are interchanged. In
turn, |ψroti remains sign-constant. Hence, the para rota-
tional states have wave functions of the A and B1 types.
levels and correspond-
ing wave functions |ψroti using the perturbation the-
ory method. The electric ﬁeld is assumed to be weak
enough so that the level shifts caused by the ﬁeld are
much smaller than the nominal distances between the
levels. The direction of the z-axis of the immovable lab-
oratory coordinate system (x, y, z) is chosen along the
electric ﬁeld vector. The interaction energy of the water
molecule with electric ﬁeld is:

the shifts of the levels are determined by the diagonal
matrix elements of the operator (2). However, they are
equal to zero for the asymmetrical rotators. Thus, the
level splitting of the water molecule is a second order
eﬀect relative to the electric ﬁeld:

where αJn is the total shift of the ”center of gravity” of
the split level and βJn is the shift of the sub-levels relative
to this ”center of gravity”. From Eqs. (3) and (5), by
performing summation over MJ and MJ ′, we obtain the
expressions for αJn and βJn. The Stark behavior of the
rotational levels of the water molecule is then calculated
with the following parameters [7, 9]: a = ¯h2/IA = 55.7
cm−1, b = ¯h2/IB = 18.6 cm−1, c = ¯h2/IC = 29.0 cm−1,
and d(0) = 1.84 Debye.

The results of the calculations for J = 0; 1 are shown
in Fig. 1. The calculations are limited by the ﬁeld of
106 V/cm to meet the requirements of the second order
approximation method we used. It is seen from the Fig-
ure, that the singlet para-level |0Ai with J = 0, shifts

down when the ﬁeld is applied. This is, of course, in ac-
cordance with the general quantum mechanical theorem
[6]. The levels with J = 1 split into 2 sub-levels. One of
these two sub-levels has MJ = 0 and is not degenerated
(thin lines in Fig. 1). Another sub-levels correspond to
MJ = ±1 and are twice degenerated (bold lines).

Fig. 1 reveals qualitatively diﬀerent trends for the or-
tho and para levels in the ﬁeld. When the ﬁeld increases,
the majority of the para-levels (the singlet |0Ai and the
twice-degenerated sub-level |1B1i) goes down. Only one
of the para levels goes up. Thus, the net energy shift
of the para levels is appreciably negative. In the case of
ortho molecules, the twice-degenerated ortho levels (bold
dash-dotted lines) diverge symmetrically as ﬁeld goes up,
the non-degenerated ortho levels lowering slightly only.
As a result, the net energy shift of the ortho levels is
notably, approximately two times, smaller than the net
shift of the para levels.

Taking into account the Boltzmann distribution of wa-
ter molecules over the energy levels, one can write the net
energy shifts ∆EO and ∆EP of the gaseous ortho and
para molecules in the electric ﬁeld E:

FIG. 2: Ratio of the energy Stark shifts for the para and ortho
water molecules as a function of temperature. The dashed line
notices the unity for eye.

The ratio R = ∆EP /∆EO gives a comparative re-
sponse of the ortho and para water molecules to an ex-
ternal electric ﬁeld. R can be considered as a ratio of the
forces acting on the para and ortho water molecules in a
non-uniform electric ﬁeld. As is seen from Eq. 6, it is a
function of temperature T and does not depend on the
ﬁeld strength.

We have calculated R(T ) for 16 lowest rotational levels
(J ≤ 3), laying in the range of 0-283 cm−1 and contain-
ing a 70 % deal of the molecules at room temperature.
The Stark shifts of the higher levels of the asymmetric
top decrease quickly when J increases [1], therefore the
contribution of the higher energy levels in R(T ) is com-
paratively small (less of 5% at room temperature). The
result of our calculations is presented in Fig. 2.

The drop of the R(T ) at T < 30 K is easy to under-
stand from simple considerations. Indeed, at low temper-
atures the water molecules occupy mainly the two lowest
ortho |1B3i and para |0Ai levels. In accordance with Fig.
1, the ortho |1B3i level is of a superior ”Stark ﬂexibil-
ity”. In an electric ﬁeld it goes sharply down predomi-
nantly causing the greater energy lowering of the ortho
molecules.

At elevated temperatures the additional para and ortho
levels get ﬁlled with molecules resulting in levelling oﬀ of
the total energy Stark shifts of the ortho and the para
molecules. Surprisingly, however, the R(T ) ratio does
not go to the unity, but exceeds it, reaching the 1.34
value at room temperature. This implies that the para
molecules in non-uniform electric ﬁelds experience a one
third stronger electric force than the ortho molecules.

The para molecules are thus proved to be more active as
the ”high ﬁeld seeking” molecules.

One can suggest the occurrence of the O/P sorting
eﬀect for the ortho and para water molecules in non-
uniform electric ﬁelds, as it is typically happening with
polar molecules [7]. Let us note, it is just electric rather
than magnetic ﬁeld that leads to a sizable distinction
between the molecules with diﬀerent magnetic arrange-
ment.

 

Obviously, one of the ﬁelds where the distinction be-
tween electrostatic properties of the ortho and para wa-
ter molecules can naturally be revealed is a water va-
por sorption on a solid surface. The impinging water
molecules are unavoidably exposed to the non-uniform
surface electric ﬁeld and, therefore, are suggested to un-
dergo the O/P separation eﬀect. A rough estimate [1] of
the total rotational energy drop ∆ of the water molecule
on the surface is: ∆ ∼ −d · E ∼ −1 kJ/mol, where d
= 1.84 Debye is a dipole moment of water molecule and
E ∼ 106 V/cm is taken as an estimate of both, a typical
surface electric ﬁeld and the highest strength allowed by
our perturbation method. As is seen, the dipole attrac-
tion energy is not negligible in comparison with the real
physadsorption energies of 5 - 20 kJ/mol [8]. The 30%
diﬀerence in ∆ for the ortho and para molecules looks
large enough to be detectable during the adsorption. We
suggest that this eﬀect is responsible for the O/P wa-
ter separation observed in absorption experiments with
water vapor [9].

Beyond the sorption, a sizable eﬀect of the O/P wa-
ter separation can be suggested to occur in the atmo-
sphere. In fact, the water vapor and atmospheric elec-
tricity (ranging from 100 V/m to 1000 V/m normally and
to millions V/m in lightnings) are inherent attributes of
the atmosphere. Allowance of O/P water separation may
give a new insight to the atmospheric phenomena.

Summarizing, our calculations point to a remarkable
diﬀerence in the forces acting on the ortho and para water
molecules subjected to non-uniform electric ﬁeld. This
distinction is of a fundamental origin. Therefore, we sug-
gest it should play an important role in nature environ-
ments.

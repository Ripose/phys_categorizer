Abstract. This article provides a review of recent work in the ﬁeld of helium
nanodroplet spectroscopy with emphasis on the dynamical aspects of the interactions
between molecules in helium as well as their interaction with this unique quantum
solvent. Emphasis is placed on experimental methods and studies introducing recent
new approaches,
in particular including time-resolved techniques. Corresponding
theoretical results on the energetics and dynamics of helium droplets are also discussed.

1. Introduction

Understanding the properties of matter starting from the interplay of atoms and
molecules has been achieved to a great deal by the study of small or model systems
containing only a few atoms. A detailed view on geometric as well as electronic
properties has been brought forward largely through application of spectroscopic tools.
These tools are continuously being improved, in particular with the aid of the availability
of sophisticated new laser systems, setting new milestones in terms of repetition rate,
power and the time and frequency structure of ultrashort pulses. On the other hand,
the path from small model systems to complex functional structures is arduous to climb.
In recent years, it has became clear that one approach towards the understanding of
complex structures of atoms and molecules is to start with well-deﬁned structures and
well-deﬁned distributions of populated states. This calls for spectroscopic studies at very
low temperatures and now a new ﬁeld emerged dealing with cold molecules or ultra-cold
chemistry.
In this regard, spectroscopic experiments involving helium droplet beams
(HElium NanoDroplet Isolation, HENDI) proved, since their introduction in 1992 [1],
to be a versatile method that provides temperatures below 1 K and oﬀers the possibility
to study well-deﬁned and complex structures of atoms and molecules. Moreover, the
quantum nature and in particular the superﬂuid properties of the droplets allow one
to investigate these quantum properties in a size-limited aggregate on the nanometer
scale. Today the ﬁeld of helium droplets is well established and several review articles
have appeared during the last decade highlighting a variety of experimental as well as

theoretical aspects [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]. In this paper, we will not
attempt a comprehensive overview of the entire ﬁeld because many experimental as well
as theoretical approaches have already been reviewed, summarized and pointed out.
Besides, the ﬁeld has grown to the point that a truly comprehensive review would now
need to be a monograph instead of a review article. We focus particularly on dynamical
aspects of the droplets and recent advances triggered e.g. by up-to-date femtosecond
techniques on the experimental side and on the theoretical side by signiﬁcant progress
in the understanding of the dynamics and energetic properties. We emphasize material
that was not available when the several reviews were written that appeared in the Special
Issue of the Journal of Chemical Physics [5, 6, 7, 8, 9] in late 2001.

The paper is organized as follows: We start with experimental aspects in the

the formation and doping of 4He as well as 3He droplet beams having certain size
distribution. We expect this information to be useful for a broad readership to get a
feeling for apparatus designs as well as feasibility considerations. In the next part, the
properties of helium droplets are reviewed, in particular focussing on energy, momenta
and excitation considerations which mainly determine the dynamics of e.g. cooling and
energy dissipation processes. The last part reviews recent work in the ﬁeld, particularly
addressing dynamical processes.

Much of the present knowledge about helium nanodroplets results from the work of
Roger Miller and his students at University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. We deeply
regret the untimely passing away of Roger Miller. Without his ideas and scientiﬁc
activities, the ﬁeld of helium droplets would be far less advanced than it presently is.

2. Experimental aspects

2.1. Production of helium nanodroplets and source design

The formation of helium droplets in the size range starting from a few helium atoms up to
aggregates having centimeters in diameter has been achieved by a variety of techniques.
This review focuses on nanodroplets in the size range of a couple of hundreds to ca. a
million helium atoms which are produced as a beam in a supersonic expansion. In the
following, other approaches are shortly summarized.

Macroscopic drops having diameters from 1 µm up to 2 cm have been formed from
capillaries or as “mist” from the boiling liquid. These drops were levitated in magnetic
[15] or laser dipolar [16] traps. Because of the much smaller surface to volume ratio
compared to nanodroplets and thus limited rate of evaporative cooling, these large
drops have temperatures in the Kelvin range. Kim and coworkers [17, 18] generated
fog of superﬂuid helium by placing an ultrasonic transducer beneath the surface of the

Spectroscopy and dynamics in helium nanodroplets

helium liquid, generating drops on the order of 100 µm in size. However, trapped large
drops have not yet been utilized for the isolation of molecules and spectroscopic studies.
Ghazarian and coworkers formed droplets in a pulsed helium expansion operated in
the vapor above liquid helium [19]. Pick-up of neutral and charged copper atoms
as well as electrons was achieved from a laser plasma generated on a rotating disc
In these experiments, the droplets are most likely not
at cryogenic temperatures.
formed in the supersonic expansion; the authors assign postexpansion condensation
in the chamber ﬁlled with helium at pressures on the order of 10 mbar to be responsible
for the agglomeration of atoms to form droplets. Sizes are not given but likely to be
larger compared to the nanodroplets discussed in this review. Charged droplets having
sizes in the micrometer range have also been generated by electro-spray methods [20].
Furthermore, the possibility of extraction of charged droplets from a liquid surface was
discovered many years ago [21]. Grisenti and Toennies have produced a jet of micron
size droplets by breakup of a superﬂuid liquid jet expanding into vacuum [22].

So far, all the experiments on the use of helium nanodroplets to spectroscopically
study attached species at millikelvin temperatures utilize supersonic expansion to form
a droplet beam freely travelling under high or ultra high vacuum conditions. One has
to establish nozzle temperatures T0 below 40 K and stagnation pressures P0 in the
range of a few to 10 MPa (100 bar) for the helium to condense to clusters or droplets.
Mean droplet sizes ¯N of about 5 000 He atoms per droplet, which is the standard
size for spectroscopic measurements, are formed under conditions of P0 = 5 MPa and
T0 = 20 K, when using a nozzle of 5 µm in diameter (cf. Fig. 2). With reasonably
achievable pumping speeds in the source vacuum chamber (< 10 000 l/s) the nozzle
pinhole openings have to be 20 µm or less to get a decent ﬂux of droplets. Aperture
discs for electron microscopes, commercially available in high quality, are commonly
used. A typical design of a helium droplet machine is depicted in Fig. 1. In most of the
cases the source chamber has an oil diﬀusion pump attached, providing high pumping
speed. We use unbaﬄed pumps 40 cm in diameter speciﬁed with 8 000 l/s. However, in
some cases we also utilized turbo pumps providing 2 000 – 3 000 l/s with small nozzles.
Droplet ﬂuxes were still on the same order of magnitude when compared to a setup
having a large diﬀusion pump.

The process of helium droplet formation is well understood and discussed elsewhere
[12, 27, 28]. Starting at nozzle conditions P0, T0, the droplets cool along an adiabatic
line in the phase diagram (isentropic expansion). The mean droplet size is determined
by P0, T0 and the nozzle diameter. Depending on whether one passes the critical point
at the high or the low temperature side, the droplets are formed by aggregating from
the gas (subcritical expansion) or by dispersing the liquid (supercritical expansion),
respectively. These two regimes of expansion parameters (nozzle conditions) are clearly
identiﬁed in the resulting size distributions (cf. Fig. 2): supercritical expansion forms
large droplets ( ¯N & 3·104), whereas a subcritical expansion is suited to generate droplets
having ¯N . 3·104. Pushing nozzle temperatures below ≈ 4 K leads to very large droplets
( ¯N ≈ 1010) with velocity as low as 15 m/s [22]. In this case Rayleigh instabilities break

up the liquid helium ﬂow. The beam of droplets so produced had a divergence of only
≈1 mrad and thus had extremely high ﬂux.

Absolute sizes have been measured by means of deﬂection in scattering experiments
[29, 24, 30] or attachment of electrons and deﬂection in electric ﬁelds [31]. The reason
why most of the spectroscopic experiments have been performed in the size range around
5000 helium atoms can be seen in Fig. 3 where the droplets ﬂux in terms of typical
ﬂuorescence signal is plotted vs. nozzle temperature. Decreasing the nozzle temperature
increases the droplet size. The maximum signal corresponds to the just mentioned size
of about 5000 helium atoms per droplet. Note the substantial lower achievable intensity
in the supercritical regime which starts for 4He droplets below 12 K under the conditions
used in Fig. 3.

As a rule of thumb, the divergency of the skimmed droplet beam is determined by
the geometry of skimmer opening and distance. We measured almost Gaussian proﬁles.
The beam is already several millimeters in diameter at a distance of 20 cm (e.g. skimmer:
0.4 mm in diameter, nozzle skimmer distance: 16 mm).

All the characteristics and properties mentioned so far refer to the formation of
continuous droplet beams. A pulsed nozzle operated at high pressure and cryogenic
temperatures was successful used by the group of A.F. Vilesov [32]. Compared to a
continuous beam, orders of magnitudes higher droplet ﬂux during the pulse have been
achieved. Pulse lengths have been determined to 30 – 100 µs. Apparently this technique
ideally combines with other inherent pulsed detection techniques, in particular when
short pulse lasers or time-of-ﬂight techniques are involved. However, due to shot-to-

shot ﬂuctuations, these pulsed beam sources so far are less attractive if one is using a
beam depletion detection method.

2.2. Doping of droplets

After having passed a skimmer, doping of the droplets is commonly achieved by inelastic
collision within a scattering cell, termed as the pick-up technique [33, 34]. The collision
energies (velocities) involved in this process are large compared to relevant energies of
the superﬂuid (Landau critical velocity). Thus frictionless transport is not an issue
and dopants are eﬃciently trapped within the droplets. Pick-up cross sections have
been determined to be on the order of 50 – 90 % of the total integral geometrical
cross section of the droplets [35]. In terms of dissipation of translational energy, this
means that time scales for cooling have to be less than ≈ 100 ps ‡. Of course, to
trap a solute, its translational energy must fall below the solvation energy in that
time, not reach equilibrium with the droplet. Typical lengths of the scattering cells

‡ This time corresponds to passing a droplet having 100 ˚A diameter at a velocity of 1000 m/s.

are a few centimeters. The required partial pressure of molecules in the cell has to
be on the order of about 10−2 Pa, providing a maximum of singly doped droplets of
¯N = 5000. Depending on the material of interest, diﬀerent techniques are suitable
to provide the required vapor pressure inside the scattering cell. Gases or high vapor
pressure liquids and solids samples are directly introduced through room temperature
capillaries. Higher temperatures are often used to establish the required vapor pressure
from bulk material inside a heated cell. Temperatures exceeding 1500 K have been used
in order to evaporate metals [36]. Thermal radiation from the cell or heating are not a
problem for the droplet beam because dipole active transitions in helium require 20 eV
of photon energy. In the same way, high temperature assemblies have been employed
to dope radicals by means of pyrolysis [37]. In this case, an eﬀusive continuous beam of
radicals eﬃciently dopes the helium droplets.

One of us (FS) introduced laser evaporation as an alternative way to produce
doped helium droplets [38]. The material is ablated from a rotating and translating rod
by a pulsed YAG or Excimer laser. The laser plasma is produced several millimeters
below the beam near to the nozzle, which means doping takes place within the helium

Spectroscopy and dynamics in helium nanodroplets

source vacuum chamber. This location appears to be essential; apparently the high
divergent ﬂux of helium atoms emerging from the nozzle opening is necessary to
thermalize the large translational energies of the atoms from the laser plasma. Metals
like e.g. Vanadium, which are hard to evaporate thermally (required temperatures more
than 1800 K), have been successfully loaded into the droplets in this way. The peak
ﬂux of singly doped droplets proved to be as high as doping from an oven. Since high
intensity nanosecond laser pulses are required in order to produce the plasma, only
a fraction of the continuous droplet beam can be doped. Typically the doped fraction
arrives at the detector spanning about 100µs. Since a signiﬁcant part of the laser plasma
consists of charged particles, also ions can be attached to helium droplets. For Mg one
ﬁnds, that the probability of ﬁnding positively charged droplets steeply increases with
increasing droplet size [38]. The time-of-ﬂight mass distributions of these ion-doped
droplets revealed surprisingly large charged droplet distributions which suggests that
the presence of charged particles enhances the condensation of droplets. The absolute
ﬂuxes of doped droplets passing a typical detection area of 1 mm2 at a distance of 50 cm
is on the order of 1010 s−1 corresponding to a number density of 108 cm−3. Combination
of laser evaporation with a pulsed helium nozzle should substantially further increase
the ﬂux.

At elevated pick-up pressure, the droplets successively collect more than a single
atom or molecule. If one neglects the change in the droplet capture cross section with
number of atoms or molecules previously trapped, the probability of picking up k species
is expected to follow a Poisson distribution

Pk =

¯kk
k!

e−¯k

where k is the number of atoms or molecules picked up and ¯k the mean number of
k, which is proportional to pickup cell pressure. This pressure dependence has been
veriﬁed for many molecules [35, 39, 40]. If we neglect the speed of the solutes relative to
that of the droplet beam, we can approximate ¯k = σρL where ρ is the number density
of the solutes in the pickup cell, L the cell length and σ the capture cross section (which
is ≈ 0.15 · N 2/3 nm2 if one assumes the geometric cross section of the droplet). Because
of the high mobility in the superﬂuid and the limited size of the conﬁning droplet,
the individually collected atoms or molecules aggregate to form complexes or clusters
[35]. When assuming σ and L to be constant these Poissonian curves can directly be
measured by varying the pick-up pressure. Such measurements are a powerful tool to
allow assignment of a spectroscopic feature to a certain oligomer sizes. We applied
this procedure successfully for clusters up to k ≈ 10. Even the onset of the intensity
distribution allows an unambiguous assignment when recording intensities of a complete
series of cluster sizes k. The high pressure tails in the distributions often signiﬁcantly
deviate from the Poisson functional form. In particular, the assumption of a constant
pick-up cross section σ no longer holds at high pressure. This is presumed to be due to
the dissipation of the collisional, internal, and complexation energies leads to evaporation

of helium atoms from the droplet and a subsequent shrinkage. In the case of dopants
which are only weakly bound to the droplets, desorption can drastically change the
cluster size distributions as discussed e.g. in [41]. Finally, the cross section σ scales as
N 2/3. This means the optimal pickup density for doping a speciﬁc number of dopants
depends on the chosen mean He-droplet size. For diﬀerent metals (alkali and alkaline
earth metals) the spectroscopic measurements done in our group (fs) and the group of
Meiwes-Broer in Rostock showed that one can agglomerate these atoms in a a helium
droplet without forming clusters unless they are laser-excited. A conclusive mechanism
for such a behavior is still lacking.

Due to the statistical character of the pickup process, experiments with a single
cluster size cannot be performed without further mass selection. The ensemble of
droplets is always loaded with a distribution of sizes. Since for small clusters the
abundance of individual cluster sizes can be extracted from the measured Poisson
distributions, one can experimentally verify cluster distributions also for larger clusters.

Spectroscopy and dynamics in helium nanodroplets

As an example, in Fig. 4 the size distribution of magnesium clusters is shown, using
photo-ionization and time-of-ﬂight mass separation. Hence, if spectroscopic features of
diﬀerent cluster sizes overlap, some ambiguity in the determination of individual spectra
cannot be avoided unless alternative means of cluster size separation, such as dispersed
emission, is used. Limitations in the number of picked-up constituents are determined
by the energy needed to dissipate collisional and binding energies on one hand, and the
energy “capacity” of the droplet on the other hand. Evaporation of one helium atoms
dissipates 5 cm−1 of energy [43]. Droplets of size 5000 provide around 3 eV energy for
cooling capacity. Large droplets have been employed to form metal clusters (e.g. MgN ,
AgN ) containing several thousands of atoms [44, 45, 46].

A unique strength in the formation of complexes and clusters in helium nanodroplets
lies in the ability to mix constituents arbitrarily and in a well deﬁned order just by
placing pick-up assemblies in series along the droplet beam.
In this way speciﬁcally
designed complexes containing a certain number of atoms and molecules can be

[55], OCS-(H2)N (N = 1 − 17) [56, 57, 58].

In general the attached species are embedded inside the droplets forming
compressed helium solvation shells as discussed below. So far, only alkali atoms [59, 60]
and molecules [61, 62], and partly alkaline earth atoms [63, 64, 65, 66] are located on the
surface because of or their bubble-like solvation structures. Ancilotto, Lerner, and Cole
have presented a simple and successful model for predicting the location of an atom or
molecule bound to helium [67].

2.3. 3He droplet beams

The study of 3He droplets adds in many experiments interesting aspects because of the
normalﬂuid property of these droplets compared to its superﬂuid 4He counterpart. The
lower chemical potential results in higher rates of desorbing atoms; thus the terminal
temperature of 3He nanodroplets in the evaporative cooling process amounts 150 mK
[68] which is considerably lower compared to 380 mK for 4He droplets. Since small 3He
droplets appear not to be stable for sizes N . 30 [69, 70, 71], aggregation is hindered
because droplets cannot be grown from small clusters adding one by one to an atom.
In contrast, cluster formation requires highly multiple collisions. As shown in Fig. 3,
at comparable nozzle size and stagnation pressure, formation of 3He droplets sets in
at lower nozzle temperatures than for 4He droplets. Note however, that the absolute
intensities are quite comparable. Determined droplet sizes are included in Fig. 2 as open
symbols. Surprisingly, there is some kind of plateau region around ¯N ≈ 5000; smaller
sizes are missing. In the regime of subcritical expansion, size distributions have been
determined to be log-normal for both 4He [29] and 3He droplets [24]. Mixed 3He-4He
droplets have also been formed by pickup of 4He by previously formed 3He droplets.

Spectroscopy and dynamics in helium nanodroplets

10

In these, the helium largely phase separates with the 4He located near the center of
the droplets. The temperature of such mixed droplets is determined by the evaporative
cooling of the outer 3He layer.

2.4. Spectroscopic tools

Most spectroscopic tools and detection techniques that have been developed or used in
molecular beam studies are in principle applicable in combination with doped helium
nanodroplet beams. A large variety has already been applied and are described in
previous review articles [6, 72, 12]. The most commonly used have been Laser Induced
Fluorescence (LIF) and depletion spectroscopy. LIF is applicable and provides the
greatest sensitivity, when atoms or molecules with high quantum yield for optical
emission are excited. When using continuous wave laser sources with suﬃcient intensity
to approximately saturate the electronic transitions, photon detection rates as high as
108 s−1 have been observed in our experiments. When using pulsed lasers, the time
averaged emission rate is reduced due to the small fraction of the beam that can be
pumped, ≈ 10−4 when using a 10 Hz laser. Because of the need for very high stray
light rejection (> 1012), careful baﬄing is needed and multiple passing of the excitation
light over the molecular beam is not practical. One can use wavelength selection of the
emission with a ﬁlter and (for pulsed excitation) time gating to reduce the scattered light,
which almost always dominates the noise. Measurement of the wavelength dispersed LIF
often provides insight into the dynamics following absorption. Time correlated photon
counting provides a way to study sub-ns dynamics. Resonant multiphoton absorption
and ionization has been used to great eﬀect as discussed below. Time resolved pump-
probe spectroscopy using fsec pulsed lasers have proved to a powerful tool for rapid
dynamics. While most studies have used laser excitation sources, two groups have
exploited synchrotron radiation in the deep UV, which has allowed the study of the
electronic excitation bands of the helium itself [73, 74, 75, 76].

When exciting ro-vibrational excitations in the IR or for many electronic excitations
as well, little or no ﬂuorescence can be detected.
In these cases, most of the energy
optically deposited in the droplet is ultimately lost by evaporation of helium atoms. As
mentioned earlier, a loss of about one helium atom per 5 cm−1 is expected based upon the
helium evaporation energy, though no quantitative experimental measurement of this
helium loss rate is yet available. The helium evaporation has been detected by depletion
of the on axis molecular beam, using either a bolometer or a mass spectrometer. The
bolometer provides greater sensitivity for beam ﬂux detection. The beam noise in a one
Hz bandwidth is equivalent to about one part in 50 000 depletion of the beam, close to
the expected shot noise in the ﬂux of droplets. The excitation laser is typically passed
many times over the molecular beam using a pair of parallel, ﬂat mirrors, so that with
kHz pulsed lasers a high duty cycle can be achieved. Because of their low bandwidth

demanding of power in the excitation source; ideally one wants to use suﬃcient optical
intensity to have high probability of at least one excitation per doped droplet.

For vibrational transitions in the IR, the typical linewidth in helium is ≈ 0.5 GHz.
If we assume a vibrational transition dipole moment of 0.1 Debye and a transition
wavenumber of 3000 cm−1, then the peak absorption cross section will be ≈ 2 · 10−16 cm2
and the excitation rate will be ≈ 4·103I s−1 where I is the optical intensity in W/cm2. If
10 cm of the beam, is illuminated by the laser, this implies that the saturation intensity
will be on the order of 1 W/cm2, and the saturation ﬂuence is on the order of 250 µJ/cm2.
The situation in droplets is more complex, especially with cw excitation, due to the fact
that linewidth is often inhomogeneously broadened, and that there is spectral diﬀusion
between states and relaxation during the ≈ 250 µs that the molecules are being pumped.
A particularly powerful spectroscopic tool, widely exploited by Roger Miller and
collaborators, has been the use of a strong DC electric ﬁeld to strongly align molecules
in the laboratory frame while inside of helium droplets, producing what are known as

structure of a vibronic band into a single narrow Q branch like peak at the band origin
with an integrated intensity as high as three times that of the entire zero ﬁeld band.
This dramatically increases both sensitivity and resolution, particularly important in
the case where many closely related clusters are being formed in the droplets [78, 51].
Miller et al. have also used this technique to measure the angle between the static
and transition dipole moments [79], which has proved to be a useful assignment tool
for the spectra of molecules with many conformers that each have multiple vibrational
transitions in a limited spectral region [80, 81]. Strong alignment of electron magnetic
moments inside helium should also occur for modest magnetic ﬁelds (≈ 1 T), and we
anticipate this being exploited as more free radicals and their complexes are studied in
helium droplets.

3. Energy, angular momenta and excitations in helium Droplets

3.1. Helium droplet excitations

The excitations of helium nanodroplets play an important role in the thermodynamics
and much of the real time dynamics that occurs in pure and doped droplets. As Landau
pointed out long ago [82], the excitation spectrum of bulk helium is responsible for
its superﬂuid properties and it is natural to assume that the excitations of droplets
are key to understanding superﬂuidity (or even if that term has any real meaning)
on a nanometer scale. The interaction of molecules with the helium excitations allow
molecules to be cooled inside the droplets and the rate of such cooling is important
in many chemical applications of HENDI. Even after the molecule and droplet reach
equilibrium, the molecule-droplet excitation interactions determine time scales for
ﬂuctuations and relaxations, and thus determine, among other things, the homogeneous
width of spectral lines.

Spectroscopy and dynamics in helium nanodroplets

12

Unfortunately, despite their importance, we have yet to develop experimental
methods to directly probe the excitation energies of helium nanodroplets, with the
exception of electronic excitations in the deep UV (< 60 nm) [73]. In bulk helium, the
low energy excitations are mostly known from x-ray and neutron diﬀraction experiments,
but such measurements have not been done on droplets and are perhaps unlikely given
the relatively small helium droplet density presently available. Thus, much of what we
know comes from theory, and in particular the liquid drop model [83], which allows one
to make connections between the droplets and the well known case of bulk helium [84].
The liquid drop model [83] (LDM) treats a helium nanodroplet as a sphere with
the same density as bulk helium, ρ = 21.8 nm−3. This implies a droplet of N helium
atoms has a radius, R(N) = 0.222 N 1/3 nm. It is known from Quantum Monte-Carlo
(QMC) calculations of various types [85, 86] that the ground and thermally averaged
density proﬁle of pure droplets is close to that assumed in the LDM, except that
the outer boundary is diﬀuse, with a 10-90% width of ≈ 0.6 nm. The elementary
excitations of such a sphere can be classiﬁed as two types, ripplons and phonons.
Ripplons are quantized capillary wave excitations. They imply no change in density
of the droplet but a change of shape. As such, their restoring force constant is
proportional to the surface tension, σ, which in the LDM is treated as equal to the
bulk value 0.363 mJ/m2. These are characterized by an angular momentum quantum
number, L ≥ 2. A ripplon with angular momentum L is a 2L + 1 degenerate
harmonic oscillator. The excitation energy of this oscillator in the LDM is given by
L(L − 1)(L + 2) K. For large L, this goes over to the
q
k2/3 excitation curve known for capillary waves on an ﬂat surface [87]. While ripplons
have no density change, except for the surface, there is a hydrodynamic ﬂow ﬁeld
that scales as (r/R(N))L and thus becomes increasingly surface localized for higher
L [87]. Ripplons are the lowest energy excitations of a nanodroplet and dominate its
thermodynamics below 1 K [83, 88].

The other elementary excitations are phonons.

In the LDM, these are the
compressional normal modes of a sphere and are characterized by a radial quantum
number, n, and an angular momentum quantum number, L. Phonons have amplitudes
described by a spherical Bessel function, jL(knLr); the values of knL = rn,L/R(N) where
rn,L is the n’th root of jL [87] . In the LDM, the excitation energy of a phonon with
wavenumber k is assumed to be the same as that of a bulk helium excitation of the
same wavenumber; the complete empirical curve was given by Donnelly and Barenghi
[84]. This excitation curve has a maximum of 13.76 K at k = 11 nm−1 (the maxon)
followed by a minimum at ∆ = 8.87 K at k = 18.5 nm−1. Phonons with wavenumber
near the minimum of the curve are called rotons. The nature of these excitations have
been discussed in [89]. For k > 21 nm−1, the excitation energy rapidly approaches 2∆
due to hybridization with two phonon states. For k signiﬁcantly below the maxon,
the excitation curve is approximately linear with a slope given by the speed of sound
in helium, u = 236 m/s. The lowest energy phonon is the symmetric breathing mode

Spectroscopy and dynamics in helium nanodroplets

13

(n = 1, L = 0) which has an excitation energy 25.5 N −1/3 K [83]. Given the terminal
temperature reached by evaporative cooling of droplets [90], even the lowest phonon
is largely unpopulated for droplets with N < 105. Ripplons dominate the nanodroplet
thermodynamic properties for temperatures below 1 K, but the larger number of phonon
excitation states cause them to dominate the thermodynamics at higher temperatures.
At such temperatures, however, the interactions between excitations are known to
become signiﬁcant in the bulk.
It is likely that the phonon contribution to the
thermodynamic functions of the droplets at such high temperatures should be calculated
In doped helium droplets, it is known that the

solute will strongly modulate the helium density in the ﬁrst solvation shell and often
in the second [91, 92]. In addition, the spherical symmetry will be lost for molecular
solutes or even atomic solutes not in S atomic states. The phonon spectrum in the
presence of solutes, even spherical, is largely unknown, but peaks observed in the phonon
wing of many electronic spectra have often been assigned to phonons localized in the
solvation structure around a solute [93], and thus expected to be weakly dependent upon
droplet size. The energy of the lowest phonon of each symmetry has been estimated
using the POISTE method [94], which monitors the rate of decay of carefully selected
trial functions under imaginary time propagation [95]. Energies are extracted using a
maximum entropy stabilized inverse Laplace transform. A more general method, that
calculates the normal modes using time dependent, density functional theory is under
development [96] and will give the entire phonon spectrum, but with the limitations
of present density functionals which are unreliable for external potentials with very
attractive interactions. Krotscheck and coworkers have used variational Monte-Carlo
methods [97] and quantum many-body methods known as HNC/EC [98], Random
Phase Approximation and Correlated Basis Function methods [11] to study the lowest
excitations of each angular momentum in pure and doped droplets.

Another type of ‘excitation’ that should be considered is quantum evaporation [99].
In bulk helium, it is known that when a phonon/roton with excitation energy greater
than the atom binding energy (7.2 K) strikes a vacuum interface, coherent emission of
an atom occurs. There is also a low energy phonon produced, with the angles of the
atom and phonon such that the momentum parallel to the surface is conserved in the
process. In the LDM, the helium binding energy is reduced by a 11.23 N −1/3 K due to
a surface energy correction [100]. The conservation of parallel momentum is replaced
by conservation of angular momentum, which will produce a centrifugal barrier for the
departing atom which will raise the threshold by ≈ 1.23 L(L + 1) N −2/3 K [101]. The
time scale for quantum evaporation can be estimated by the time it takes a phonon
to transverse from the center to edge of a droplet (≈ 10 ps using the speed of sound)
and this will lead to a lifetime broadening of the phonons of ≈ 1 K. This will largely
“wash out” the discrete excitation spectrum of the droplets and thus provide a true
continuum into which relaxation can take place. Given the low phonon density of states
in nanodroplets, some broadening mechanism is needed to rationalize the relatively
smooth, narrow line shapes of ro-vibrational transitions of molecules solvated in helium.

A vortex or vortex ring is a qualitatively diﬀerent type of excitation that is possible
in nanodroplets [102, 103], but as of yet there is no evidence for their presence [104]. A
vortex is a topological defect with a quantum of helium circulation around the defect.
The simplest such excitation is a straight line vortex going down the middle of a droplet
(north pole to south pole). Such a vortex has one unit of angular momentum per helium
atom, and each atom a distance of r from the vortex has a velocity of ~/mr. In bulk
helium, a hollow core model is quite successful at predicting the energetics and velocity
of quantized vortices [105]. Applied to helium droplets, such a model predicts an energy
of a vortex in a helium nanodroplet of a few hundred K for droplets of interest in
experiments. Extensive Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations have been made
of the straight vortex in pure and doped droplets and the energetics are close to those
predicted by the simple hollow core model [103]. The vortex angular momentum is
predicted to distort the droplet from spherical symmetry, but only slightly [103, 104].
This energy of a vortex is so much higher than the droplet temperature, that it was
suggested that vortices would rapidly decay in nanodroplets. However, such droplets
are by far the lowest energy states of high angular momentum and there do not appear
to be any open channels by which such vortices could decay, conserving both energy
and total angular momentum, which is of course required [104]. Furthermore, there
are a whole family of curved vortex solutions that have a vortex rotating around the
droplet [102]. Both the energy and angular momentum of such solutions drop as the
distance of closest approach of the vortex from the axis is increased. To date, only hollow
core model calculations have been done on such solutions due to their lower symmetry
[102, 104]. It is predicted that vortex solutions will be the lowest energy states of a
droplet for total angular momentum of 131 (846) ~ for droplets with N = 103(104)
[104]. These values of the total angular momentum are quite a bit higher than the
RMS value expected for a droplet treated at a canonical ensemble at T = 0.38 K (8.5
(38.7) ~ for N = 103(104)). However, recent statistical evaporative cooling calculations
that include angular momentum conservation have found that a substantial fraction
of the initial angular momentum deposited upon pick-up of a solute atom or molecule
(typically several thousand ~) is trapped in the droplets after the helium evaporation is
ﬁnished. Thus, the doped droplets studied in experiments should have suﬃcient angular
momentum to produce vortex solutions. In a doped droplet with a vortex, the impurity
is expected to bind to the vortex [106] (as is known to occur in the bulk) and could be
expected to align strongly with the vortex axis (though no quantitative calculation has
yet been made). Such a pinned solute molecule would not be expected to display the gas
phase like ro-vibrational structure that is almost always observed in helium droplets.
It has been predicted that the presence of a vortex will cause Ca atoms to move from
surface to bulk binding to a helium droplet [107]. The lack of observation of droplets
with trapped vortices is one of the most signiﬁcant unresolved puzzles in the ﬁeld.

For doped helium nanodroplets, another form of excitation is the translational
motion of the solute. The minimum energy position of a solvated atom or molecule
(with the exception of alkalis and some alkaline earths atoms and their molecules) is

Spectroscopy and dynamics in helium nanodroplets

15

in the center of a droplet [67, 108]. If one assumes that the helium solvation structure
moves with the solute, then one can calculate the eﬀective conﬁnement potential of
the solute in terms of the long range He-solute Cn constants [108] and a buoyancy
correction [109] due to the number of helium atoms displaced by the solute. This leads to
a 3D, approximately harmonic trap with vibrational frequencies typically below 1 GHz.
The translation motion of the solute results in a dense set of many populated “particle in
a box” states [110, 108]. The direct excitation of these modes upon optical absorption
is not expected since the predicted Doppler broadening is much narrower than the
frequency of the oscillator, leading to strong motional narrowing [108]. Stated in another
way, since the absorbers are conﬁned in a droplet much smaller than the excitation
wavelength, there expected Doppler broadening is Dicke-narrowed [111] away. However,
there are at least three mechanisms that can lead to changes in the solute translational
energy upon optical excitation. One is that the potential of interaction of the solute with
the helium solvent changes upon electronic and/or vibrational excitation [108]. Change
in the helium solvation structure leads to a “phonon wing” in the spectrum that is
typically observed upon electronic excitation [112, 113]. A change in the long range
interaction coeﬃcients (particularly the C6) will result in a diﬀerence in the eﬀective
trapping potential between the two solute states in the transition. This will result
in nonzero Frank-Condon factors for transitions that change the translational state
and thus ﬁne structure on the absorption lines. Another mechanism to “light up” the
translational motion states are coupling to the rotation of the molecule [108]. A molecule
at the very center of a droplet will experience an isotropic potential. However, when it is
displaced from the center, the dependence of the C6 on orientation of the helium relative
to the molecule axis results in an anisotropic potential that increases in magnitude
rapidly as the solute is displaced further from the center. There is another coupling
that arises from the fact that the eﬀective translational mass of the solute is a function
of its orientation and that this leads to a hydrodynamic coupling of the orientation of the
molecule with its instantaneous momentum [108]. Both mechanisms lead to a mixing of
diﬀerent translational states with molecular rotor states (especially those that diﬀer only
in the angular momentum projection quantum number and thus are degenerate without
considering this interaction). This translational state mixing leads to splitting of what
would otherwise be expected to be single solute ro-vibrational transitions. Since these
translational energy changes depend strongly on the size of the droplet, and almost
all experiments done to date sample a broad droplet size distribution, the expected
ﬁne structure on solute transitions will likely be washed out, contributing to the line
broadening of the transition.

3.2. Evaporative cooling and the temperature of helium nanodroplets

In most HENDI experiments, droplets are doped by the pick-up technique pioneered by
Scoles and coworkers [33]. The pick-up process will deposit substantial kinetic energy
and angular momentum into the droplets, in both cases approximately proportional

Spectroscopy and dynamics in helium nanodroplets

16

to the mass of the picked up species. In addition, any thermal internal energy of the
dopant, the solvation energy of the dopant in helium, and any binding energy (in the
If we assume the
case of cluster formation) will contribute to the deposited energy.
droplets statistically distribute this energy, the temperature of the droplets will raise to
several K, typically above the λ transition of bulk helium. Following this temperature
jump, the droplets will rapidly cool by helium evaporation [83, 101].

Treatment of the many body evaporation by real time quantum dynamics is clearly
a very diﬃcult problem. Statistical rate treatments of evaporation are certainly feasible
and one can hope reasonably accurate, once the droplets have cooled suﬃciently that the
evaporation rate is slow compared to the rate for equilibration between the excitations
of the droplet. Unfortunately, we have no estimate for what that rate is! The statistical
rate equations only require knowledge of the density of states as a function of energy
and the threshold energy for evaporation [114]. Brink and Stringari [83] made such a
calculation, using the LDM to calculate the density of states. They predicted that for
the evaporation time appropriate for HENDI experiments, the terminal temperature
should be ∼ 0.3 K. Later IR HENDI experiments, starting with Hartmann et al. [90],
demonstrated that the rotational populations of solvated molecules are well described
by Boltzmann distributions with temperatures in the range 0.37 ± 0.02 K. This result
was interpreted as strongly supporting the statistical evaporation model and also the
natural interpretation that the rotational populations of the solvated molecule were in
equilibrium with the droplet excitations resulting in the equal temperature.

Based upon the surface energy contribution to the evaporation energy, one would
expect that smaller droplets would cool to a lower temperature. This is not the case,
however, because, at a minimum, the spread of droplet internal energy at least matches
the evaporation energy of the last helium atom, and this corresponds to a larger spread
of droplet temperature in a smaller droplet, which of course has a lower heat capacity.
Attempts to experimentally test the predicted dependence of ﬁnal temperature on
mean droplet size is frustrated by the fact that the individual ro-vibrational transitions
broaden and become strongly asymmetric in shape for smaller droplet sizes, which makes
the determination of the temperature from the spectrum less precise [115].

Most of the literature on helium droplets have, sometime tacitly, assumed that the
droplets are described by a canonical distribution at a ﬁnal temperature near 0.38 K. We
cite, as examples, the predictions of spectral structure by one of the present authors [108]
and the wide use of Path Integral Monte Carlo calculations [92, 116] which provide an
average over a canonical distribution (i.e. Boltzmann weighting) of states. However, it
is clear that individual droplets, after evaporation has stopped or slowed to a negligible
rate, have a constant energy, E, not constant temperature, i.e. are more properly
described as a microcanonical ensemble. Of course, it is possible for individual droplets
to have deﬁnite energy and for the ensemble of droplets probed in an experiment to follow
a canonical distribution. However, the evaporative cooling calculations predict that for
droplet in the size range studied in most experiments, the spread of ﬁnal energies for a
given droplet size is determined by the evaporation energy, not the energy ﬂuctuations of

Spectroscopy and dynamics in helium nanodroplets

17

a canonical ensemble. Perhaps more importantly, an isolated droplet must also conserve
total angular momentum, J, and thus should be described by an ensemble that has both
E and J as good quantum numbers [101].

The evaporative cooling calculations of Brink and Stringari

ignored angular
momentum constraints. It is straightforward to include these in the evaporative cooling
using a formalism analogous to phase space theory in the treatment of unimolecular
dissociation [114]. Such calculations require knowledge of the density of states as a
function of both E and J. This density of states has been calculated and ﬁt to simple
analytic functions for both ripplons and phonons (in the limit that they can be treated
with a linear dispersion relation) [88]. Perhaps not surprisingly, the density of states as
a function of J for ﬁxed E turns out to be very accurately described by a Boltzmann
distribution for a spherical top, but with an eﬀective temperature that has nothing to
do with the droplet temperature. The droplet temperature, deﬁned in terms of the
derivative of the log of the density of states with respect to energy at ﬁxed total J, is
a strong function of J for ﬁxed total E. Monte-Carlo Statistical evaporative cooling
calculations have been performed, conserving total angular momentum, and the result
was some what surprising [88]. The ﬁnal states are spread over a broad range of E
and J, but are clustered in a narrow band around a line of constant temperature in
the E, J plane. This ﬁnal temperature is essentially identical to that predicted by
the earlier Brink and Stringari calculations. However, the spread of E and J is more
than an order of magnitude higher than predicted for a canonical distribution at the
same temperature. For ﬁxed E, the fraction of the initial angular momentum that is
trapped in the droplet increases with increasing J. Also, the initial alignment of the
angular momentum (which for pick-up is primarily perpendicular to the droplet velocity
vector) is largely conserved. Statistical theory predicts that this alignment is partially
transfered to the angular momentum of a solvated rotor. Experiments had demonstrated
a lab frame alignment of tetracene, in qualitative agreement with these predictions [117].
The statistical theory predicts that the evaporated helium atoms are anisotropic in the
frame moving with the droplet and measurement of that distribution could provide a
quantitative test of the statistical evaporation model.

The recent evaporative cooling results imply that the assumption of a canonical
distribution of
internal states of the droplet and solute is likely a very poor
approximation. This calls into question the accuracy of using the Path Integral Monte
It also predicts that the distribution of center
Carlo for modeling helium droplets.
of mass states of the solute is likely much broader than perviously predicted. This
may explain, at least in part, the failure of theory to predict the inhomogeneous line
broadening that is commonly observed in IR spectra of doped helium droplets [108].
An interesting consequence is that the high angular momentum introduces a bias into
the populations of a rotor such that the temperature extracted from a ﬁt to those
populations in shifted higher than the temperature of the entire droplet-solute system,
treated as a statistical ensemble [118]. In order to account for the strongly nonthermal
eﬀects that arise from the trapped angular momentum, a realistic knowledge of the

Spectroscopy and dynamics in helium nanodroplets

18

terminal distribution is needed. While statistical models can predict this, at present we
have no way to assess if these predictions are at all reliable. Getting the ﬁnal temperature
correct only provides support that statistical theory is correct for the evaporation of the
last few helium atoms, which we would have expected to begin with. Clearly, there is
a important need for experiments that can measure the distribution of the the droplet
excitations. At the end of evaporative cooling, most of the trapped angular momentum
is predicted to be in the lowest ripplon mode, creating a quadrupole distortion of the
droplets. It is at least in principle possible that excitation in this mode could be probed
with Raman Spectroscopy (though signal estimates are not encouraging!) or by atom
scattering experiments, particular by atoms held e.g. in a magneto optical trap.

4. Superﬂuidity and Molecular Rotation in Nanodroplets

Superﬂuidity in helium has continued to fascinate since its discovery in the 1930’s.
The phenomenological two ﬂuid model is of great value in interpreting experiments
[119]. In this model, helium below the λ point is treated as a mixture of normal and
superﬂuid liquids. Landau developed the theory of the normal ﬂuid component as a gas
of quasiparticle excitations [82]. He also gave an experimental deﬁnition of the normal
ﬂuid fraction in terms of the ratio of the observed to classical moment of inertia for
inﬁnitesimal rotation of the sample, a deﬁnition used by Andronikashvili in his classic
experiment with a torsional oscillator [120]. Ceperley developed a Path Integral Monte-
Carlo (PIMC) estimator that calculates this inertial response of a sample in a simulation
cell [121]. This involves calculating the projected areas of Feynman loops that include
He exchange. Superﬂuidity as deﬁned by Landau is a macroscopic concept; Feynman
explicitly warns against giving it a microscopic interpretation [122]. Yet, the appeal to
interpret behavior of helium nanodroplets in terms of a superﬂuid has been irresistible.
Nanodroplets provide a way to study superﬂuidity on a nanometer length scale, but as
is common with other bulk thermodynamic quantities, ambiguities arise when applied
on the atomic scale.

Sindzingre, Klein and Ceperley [123] provided the ﬁrst calculations of the normal
and superﬂuid fractions of a helium cluster. They found clusters as small as 64 He
displayed clear evidence for superﬂuidity based upon the inertial response, and clusters
of 128 atoms displayed a remnant of the λ transition. Similar calculations where
then done on a 39 atom helium cluster doped with SF6 [92]. The observation that
molecules often have substantially reduced rotational constants when observed in helium
nanodroplets was interpreted as a “Microscopic Andronikashvili Experment” [124], with
the increase in the moment of inertia assigned to a helium normal ﬂuid that rotates
In order to calculate such a predicted moment of inertia, one
with the molecule.
needs the spatial dependence of the normal ﬂuid density, which is not provided by
Ceperley’s original method. Kwon and Whaley [125] introduced a PIMC estimator of
a local normal ﬂuid density based upon a separation of the number of short and long
exchange paths. Assuming that this “normal ﬂuid” rotated rigidly with the molecule

Spectroscopy and dynamics in helium nanodroplets

19

(what they referred to as adiabatic following), they calculated the helium contribution
to the eﬀective moment of inertia of SF6 in helium and found good agreement with the
experimentally determined value [125]. This group published several papers using this
approach [126, 127, 128].

This deﬁnition of local normal ﬂuid has been questioned by Draeger and Ceperley
[129]. The derived local density, when integrated, does not reproduce the inertial
properties calculated with the Ceperley PIMC estimator, i.e. it does not give the proper
global normal ﬂuid fraction. It is a scalar quantity, while the inertial response and thus
normal ﬂuid fraction of an inhomogeneous quantum ﬂuid is a second rank tensor as
is the Ceperley PIMC estimator. Draeger and Ceperley introduced new deﬁnitions of
local normal and superﬂuid densities that have the proper symmetry and integrate to
the correct global densities. They used the normal ﬂuid estimator to calculate the
moments of inertia for rotation of (HCN)n clusters in helium [129] by assuming this
normal ﬂuid rotates with the molecule. One interesting conclusion of their work is that
there is a normal ﬂuid fraction for rotation around the symmetry axis that reﬂects
thermal excitations in the ﬁrst solvation layer present even at 0.38 K. Such excitations
carry angular momentum and result in the prediction of a Q branch in the spectrum.
Such Q branches have been seen in the spectrum observed by the Miller group [130]
and their relative intensities are in at least qualitative agreement with the predictions
of the normal ﬂuid fractions calculated [131]. The Draeger/Ceperley estimator is not
unique. One could add to the deﬁnition a second rank tensor that will integrate to zero
and still recover the proper global superﬂuid estimator. Recently, Kwon and Whaley
[132] have introduced such a modiﬁcation and obtained local superﬂuid densities quite
diﬀerent from the Draeger/Ceperley estimator.

Another approach to the calculation of the eﬀective rotational constants of
molecules in helium is to calculate the hydrodynamic ﬂow of helium needed to maintain
a static helium solvation structure in the rotating from of the molecule [133, 134].
This treatment assumes adiabatic following of the helium density structure that rotates
rigidly with the molecule (but not the helium atoms themselves). This assumption,
combined with the equation of continuity, gives a diﬀerential equation for the helium
velocity. It is further assumed that the helium ﬂow is irrotational, which Lord Kelvin
showed was the minimum kinetic energy solution to the equation of continuity for a
given time dependent density [87]. This implies that the local helium velocity can
be written as minus the gradient of a scaler function known as the velocity potential.
This deﬁnition of adiabatic following of the quantum hydrodynamic model is distinct
from that introduced independently by Kwon and Whaley [125] and is based upon an
assumption that the frequency for molecular rotation is low compared to the excitations
of the helium. The normal ﬂuid response calculations are based upon inﬁnitesimal
rotation and thus is also dependent upon an assumption of a separation of time scale.
The helium density structure was estimated using helium Density Functional Theory
[135], though this approximation was not essential. Good agreement was found for
the rotational constants of a number of heavy molecules (especially considering the

Spectroscopy and dynamics in helium nanodroplets

20

considerable uncertainty of the He-molecule interaction potentials), but not for light
molecules HCN and HCCH. The later were attributed to a breakdown of adiabatic
following, which was later demonstrated experimentally [136] and theoretically [137] in
the case of HCN.

A similar hydrodynamic calculation for the hydrodynamic mass of alkali cations
in helium was found to be in essentially quantitative agreement [138] with high
level QMC calculations [139]. Kwon et al.
[126] reported that the hydrodynamic
model dramatically underestimates the eﬀective moment of inertia of SF6 in helium.
Lehmann and Callegari [140] agreed with this conclusion if one used previously reported
PIMC densities as input to the calculation, but found that if Diﬀusion Monte-Carlo
(DMC) densities (calculated with the same potential!) were used, the hydrodynamic
calculations were in quantitative agreement with experiment. They argue that since
the hydrodynamic model is a zero temperature theory, the ground state helium density
(which are calculated with DMC) should be used instead of the thermally averaged
density (which is what is calculated by PIMC).

For light rotors (B ≥ 0.5 cm−1), adiabatic following breaks down and one must
explicitly account for molecule rotation in any quantum simulation. Viel and Whaley
[137] used the POITSE method to estimate the energy of excited rotational states of
HCN. The Whaley group has continued the development of this method and has applied
it to a number of systems [141, 142, 143]. More accurate is the use of imaginary time
orientational correlations functions to extract the excited rotational states which were
introduced by Moroni et al. [144, 145, 146, 147, 148]. This has allowed for essentially
exact calculation of the rotational excitation energies of molecules in small to modest
size helium clusters and has been found to be in essentially quantitative agreement with
recent experiments (discussed below). Blinov and Roy [149, 150] have introduced similar
calculations using PIMC instead of DMC to calculate the orientational correlation
functions. The Whaley group is also using similar methods [151, 152] in addition to
several others that they have pioneered.

Zillich and Whaley have developed the DMC/CBF method for treating the
interaction of molecular rotation excitation with the phonons and rotons of helium
and applied it to the case of HCN [153] and C2H2 [151], an important yet challenging
problem. This model treats the phonons of the droplet as if they are continuous and
have the same form as for bulk helium and then decomposes the density anisotropy that
rotates with the molecule in terms of these phonon modes. In this model, oﬀ resonant
interactions shift the rotational excitation energy. The interaction of the rotor with the
rotons is predicted to lead to absorption intensity for the rotons. The observation of
such absorption would provide an important further test of the DMC/CBF model.

The use of Density Functional Theory for treating helium has been very active and
is beyond what we can realistically cover in this review. The groups of F. Ancilotto,
M. Barranco, F. Dalfovo, J. Eloranta, E.S. Hernandez, and L. Szybiryz have been
particularly active. A great part of this work has been reviewed in [14].

5. Review of recent work

5.1. Femtosecond dynamics

Dynamical processes are directly accessible applying femtosecond real-time spectroscopy.
The ﬁrst explicitly time resolved studies in helium droplets used the technique of time
correlated photon counting, which allowed detection of time resolved changes in emission
with ≈ 100 ps time resolution. This proved suﬃcient to detect radiative and quenching
rates and the exciplex formation rates in cases of a suﬃciently high barrier. Ultrafast
laser pump/probe experiments allow probing time scales from tens of femtoseconds up to
hundreds of picoseconds. These methods allow the nuclear motion of the probed atoms
and molecules and changes in solvation structure to be addressed. In connection with
the experiments in helium droplets this is of peculiar interest because of the quantum
nature at these low temperature and eﬀects related to e.g. delocalization of atoms or the
superﬂuid properties, which outstandingly alter the dynamics of a ﬂuid. In collaboration
with C.-P. Schulz (Max-Born-Institute Berlin) one of our groups (FS) has performed over
several years femtosecond pump-probe experiments of doped helium nanodroplets. It
was demonstrated that even with the dilute target of a doped droplet beam, dynamical
studies can be successfully realized. A variety of problems have been tackled which are
summarized in the following.

5.1.1. Wave packet propagation of alkali dimers The goal of studying the geometric and
electronic structure of molecules at low temperature conditions relies on the weak and
isotropic interaction with the helium environment. Results and their interpretation may
signiﬁcantly degrade if one is not able to quantify the perturbation of the surrounding
matrix. For that reason the vibrational motion of molecules attached to helium droplet
has to be compared to gas-phase experiments. Vibrations of alkali dimers attached
to helium nanodroplets were followed in real-time applying femtosecond pump-probe
techniques. Depending on parameters like the excitation wavelength or photon intensity,
wave packet propagation in potassium dimers has been observed in the electronically
excited states A1Σ+
g [154], see for
example Fig. 5. The oscillation of the mass-selected photo-ionization intensity directly
images the wave packet motion revealing vibrational frequencies as well as its time
dependence. A Fourier analysis of the time spectra comprises the assignment to the
excited vibrational states. Furthermore, the phase of the oscillations gives information
on transition probabilities and the location of the probe window, i.e. the distance at
the internuclear coordinate which ampliﬁes the probe step and is required for detecting
dynamics. When compared to the free dimer, the formation of a ground state (X 1Σ+
g )
wave packet from a Raman process was found to be strongly enhanced in the droplet
environment. At photon energies around 12500 cm−1 this process even dominates the
pump-probe signal. Since the vibrational motion in the ground state was found to
be unaltered when compared to the gas-phase K2, the diﬀerence in the transition
probabilities must originate from the perturbed electronically excited states. Indeed,

detection window. In this regard desorption times upon electronic excitation have been
determined for the ﬁrst time. The experiments give a desorption time of K2 excited
into the electronic A state of ≈ 3 ps. The analysis of excited wave packets in higher
electronic states of K2 reveals an even faster desorption behavior [154].

5.1.2. Fragmentation dynamics of alkali clusters The fragmentation dynamics of
alkali clusters (Kn, 3 < n < 11) has been studied in order to directly measure the
energy dissipation and cooling process of helium droplets [159]. These experiments
were performed using small potassium clusters because their electronic excitation and
subsequent fragmentation has been investigated in a variety of experimental studies. The
pump-probe experiments of alkali-cluster doped helium droplets allow one to follow the
abundance of selected cluster sizes in real-time. In this case the probe step determines
the yield of mass selected ions from a non-resonant photo-ionization process. Fig. 7
plots such a recorded ion yield as a function of delay time. Following a fragmentation

model introduced by K¨uhling et al. [158], a fragmentation time of 5.8 ps is determined in
this case. In the gas-phase potassium as well as sodium show values which are around
≈ 1 ps [160]. The longer fragmentation times determined in connection with helium
droplets are interpreted in terms of a competing channel where the energy of the laser-
heated alkali cluster is dissipated into the helium droplet prior to fragmentation. Fig. 8
shows a striking droplet size eﬀect of the measured fragmentation dynamics. The larger
droplets cool the energy much more eﬃciently, resulting in even longer fragmentation
times. The energy to be dissipated depends on the photon energy, cluster size etc. and
will be discussed thoroughly in [159]. Roughly speaking, excess energy of the order of
1 eV is transferred to the helium droplet in less than a ps to comply with the observed
eﬀects. Assuming that this energy (thousands of K) cannot reside in internal degrees of
freedom of the droplet and is ad hoc evaporatively cooled, this means, that on the order
of 2000 helium atoms per ps leave the droplet. Experiments on NO2 excited well above
the gas phase dissociation threshold but with no evidence of dissociation in helium also
suggest vibrational relaxation cooling with similar ultrafast rates [161, 162].

5.1.3. Surface dynamics
In the same line of experiments, recent results demonstrate
that alkali atoms can be utilized as probes for surface excitations of helium droplets
[163, 164].
Inducing a spacial expansion of the alkali valence electron orbital upon
laser excitation, the helium environment rearranges. Several time-dependent features
are identiﬁed in pump-prob experiments. Assignment to speciﬁc surface modes of the
droplets could so far not be achieved. As expected, strong droplet size eﬀects are present.
The expansion of the dimple structure takes place at picosecond time scales. In these
experiments normalﬂuid 3He droplets have been directly compared to superﬂuid 4He
counterparts. Surprisingly 3He droplets show a comparable behavior and quite similar
eﬀects.

5.1.4. Exciplex formation The experiments of alkali atoms on the surface of helium
droplets revealed a variety of aspects on dynamical processes triggered by laser
excitations. In several studies the formation of alkali-helium exciplexes upon excitation
of atomic transitions explained the observed features in wavelength dispersed, laser-

induced ﬂuorescence spectra [59, 166, 60, 167, 165]. Fig. 9 illustrates the formation
process. The alkali excited in the p-state will strongly bind a He atom if it approaches
in the nodal plane of the p orbital. Hence an excited alkali-helium molecule is formed
upon p ← s laser excitation, bound by a couple of hundreds of cm−1, depending on the
corresponding alkali. Since the binding energy of the exciplex to the droplet surface is
weak, the binding energy release leads to desorption. Eventually the complex dissociates
when radiatively decaying into the electronic ground state, typically after nanoseconds.
To date, this process has been experimentally conﬁrmed for Na, K, Rb and Cs. Besides

the surface of helium nanodroplets. Plotted is the yield of RbHe molecules which
form upon laser excitation. Diﬀerent formation times are observed for diﬀerent helium
isotopes. Surprisingly the population of Rb4He builds up in signiﬁcantly shorter times
[165].

diatomic exciplexes one also observes larger molecules (M∗Hen, M=metal, n > 1) as
known from studies in bulk helium [168, 169]. From the beginning, the dynamics of this
process appeared to be an interesting example of photo-induced molecule formation. The
ﬁrst experiment giving information on the dynamics of the formation process was carried
out in Princeton, applying time correlated photon counting [170, 171]. The evolution of
the ﬂuorescence of Na*He as well as K*He was monitored. A substantial diﬀerence
in formation rates was observed following excitation of the two diﬀerent spin-orbit
component of the excited 2P alkali state. Modeling the data based on a tunneling process
into the molecular alkali-helium well, the contributions of the extraction energy of
helium atoms from the droplet and spin-orbit coupling eﬀects were discussed. Predicted
exciplex formation times of the heavier alkalies were derived from the model. Since
the measured formation times of 50 ps (K*He) approached the resolution of the applied
experimental technique, the use of femtosecond pump-probe techniques became evident.
Indeed, the formation times could be determined for K*He as well as Rb*He employing
mass-resolved multi photon ionization in a pump-probe arrangement [172, 165]. These
experiments included a direct comparison of 4He and 3He droplets. Fig. 10 shows

Spectroscopy and dynamics in helium nanodroplets

28

the real-time spectra monitoring the yield of Rb*4He and Rb*3He. Formation times
are determined to be 8.5 ps and 11.6 ps, respectively. For both isotopes the exciplex
formation occurs very much in the same way, although we are dealing with very diﬀerent
ﬂuids, on one hand a Bose-Einstein condensed 4He superﬂuid liquid, and, on the other
hand the 3He Fermi normal ﬂuid. The longer formation time of the 3He exciplex is a
very surprising result and does not agree with the predictions of the just mentioned
tunneling model. Diﬀerent vibrational relaxation times are suggested to account for the
diﬀerence, which still has to be conﬁrmed in a quantitative theoretical model.

In the same exciplex formation process quantum interference structures have been
observed [163, 173]. Recent experiments having attosecond time resolution in recording
interference fringes demonstrate that quantum interference structures are suitable to get
detailed information on the vibrational structure of the exciplex molecules. Moreover,
the interaction potential can even be monitored during the formation of the metastable
molecules. The interference oscillations survive the bond formation process and provide
a new tool to determine the energy of vibrational states with a resolution on the order
of ≈ 1 cm−1 [173].

5.2. Fragmentation of dopants

Employing intense femtosecond laser pulses,
femtosecond ionization of magnesium
clusters has been studied by high resolution mass spectrometry in the group of Meiwes-
Broer [45]. Decomposition of the Mg-clusters dominates the process. The charging
of the fragments is signiﬁcantly governed by the interaction with the helium droplet.
Pump-probe experiments on the MgHe+
N snowball formation clearly show dynamics up
to 50 ps.

Fragmentation dynamics upon ionization of neon clusters (Nen, n < 14) embedded
in helium nanodroplets have been theoretically investigated by Halberstadt and
coworkers [174]. Here a Molecular Dynamics with Quantum Transitions (MDQT)
approach has been used; the helium environment is modeled in terms of friction
forces. Besides ﬁtting the friction coeﬃcient of helium droplets which surprisingly
comes out rather high compared to superﬂuid helium, fragmentation branching ratios are
calculated which are compared with experimental studies on electron impact ionization
of neon-doped droplets [175]. Here the helium environment signiﬁcantly stabilizes larger
fragments. The calculations give a detailed view on the short time evolution of the
proportion of the species involved in the dissociation process.

5.3. Photo-dissociation in helium droplets

The ﬁrst photo-dissociation experiments using helium droplet isolation were performed
on K triplet dimers and on Na and K triplet trimers, using both the methods
of wavelength resolved emission and time correlated photon counting. This work
revealed that excitation of K2 to a largely repulsive 3Πg state leads to both the
expected atomic K emission and also to emission from molecules in the 1Πu state,

Spectroscopy and dynamics in helium nanodroplets

29

demonstrating that intersystem crossing in excited alkali states can compete even with
direct dissociation [176]. In the case of the quartet trimers, the rate of predissociation
following electronic excitation, due to curve crossing by a repulsive single surface, has
been measured as a function of vibrational energy in the excited state [177]. This
dependence suggests that the crossing occurs slightly above the minimum in the excited
state. The atomic and dimer emission to higher energy than the excitation wavelength is
allowed due to the formation of the stronger singlet dimer bond upon dissociation of the
weakly bound quartet trimer. The presence of dimer emission from the 1Πu state but
not the lower energy 1Σu state points to dissociation on a state that is antisymmetric
with respect to the molecular plane of the trimer.

A novel experimental strategy to directly probe the translational dynamics of
neutral species embedded in helium nanodroplets has been pursued by Drabbels and
coworkers [178, 179]. They create fragments from a photo-dissociation process with
well-deﬁned velocity distributions inside a helium nanodroplet. The comparison of
the fragments’ initial and ﬁnal (after having left the droplet) velocity distribution
provides detailed insight into the translational dynamics and the interaction with the
helium environment. The three-dimensional speed and angular distributions of various
departing reaction products are measured using a velocity map imaging setup. Photo-
fragments are nonresonantly ionized by femtosecond laser pulses, delayed 20 ns after
triggering the photolysis. The 266 nm A-band photo-dissociation of CH3I and CF3I
has been investigated inside 4He droplets having sizes from 2000 to 20000. For all the
examined sizes, some of the photo-fragments escape from the helium droplets, though
sometimes with a small helium cluster around them. Compared to classical solid clusters
where already a few solvation shells around the parent molecule lead to complete caging
[180, 181, 182], the helium droplets reveal extraordinary dynamical properties. The
measured velocities are found to be considerably shifted to lower speeds with respect to
the photo-dissociation of gas-phase photo-dissociated molecules. Based on the observed
speed distributions and anisotropy parameters it is concluded that the CF3 fragments
escape via a direct mechanism, only partially transferring their excess kinetic energy to
the droplet. Iodine atoms, despite their lower initial kinetic energy, escape with lower
fractional loss of kinetic energy. Accompanying Monte Carlo simulations suggest that
mainly binary classical collision with the helium atoms can account for the ﬁndings.
Since recoil energies are quite high, no quantum nature in terms of superﬂuidity and
Landau’s critical velocity had to be introduced to model the ﬁndings. The low energy
fragments show an isotropic angular distribution. With increasing recoil energy and
product mass, the reaction product angular distribution become similar to the free
molecule. As expected, larger mean droplet sizes result in higher kinetic energy losses
and more isotropic angular distributions of the departing products. As an example, in
Fig. 11 the angular as well as velocity distributions of the CF3 fragments dissociating
CF3I are shown. The molecules were dissociated using pulses from the 266 nm fourth
harmonic of a Nd:YAG laser. The fragments were ionized in a non-state-selective way
employing femtosecond 800 nm laser pulses delayed 18 ns with respect to the dissociation.

distributions (lower panel) were obtained by performing numerical Abel inversions on
the intensity distributions shown above.

Results obtained with diﬀerent cluster sizes are compared.

5.4. Photo-electrons of pure and doped helium droplets

Many detection schemes include ionization processes of the embedded atoms and
molecules. The outcome and interpretation of results often is linked to the dynamics
and the fate of the produced charged particles. It is therefore instructive to study the
produced electrons by means of photo-electron spectroscopy. The ﬁrst task in that

Spectroscopy and dynamics in helium nanodroplets

31

direction indicated that the kinetic energy distributions of electrons is dominated by
slow electrons having average energies less than 0.6 meV, when photon energies of about
24 eV are used for ionization of the droplets [76]. A corresponding strong interaction
or “thermalization” of electrons produced inside the droplet would therefore limit the
usefulness of photo-electron spectroscopic techniques for the study of embedded species.
Fortunately the results introduced in the following conﬁrm that this is not as a universal
behavior following intra-droplet ionization.

The ﬁrst photo-electron spectrum of an embedded neutral species was presented
by Tiggesb¨aumker and coworkers [183]. Mass-selected Ag8 clusters were resonantly
(R2PI) ionized by 3.96 eV photons. The ionization threshold was found to be in good
agreement with available theoretical calculations and previous gas-phase experiments.
In contrast to the experiments on the pure droplets, the ionization threshold is not
signiﬁcantly altered by the helium environment. This is perhaps surprising given that
the conduction band for electrons in bulk helium is almost 1 eV above vacuum, which
would appear to imply that the ionization threshold in helium should be raised by
nearly this amount. In this regard the nanometer dimensions of the helium droplets
are crucial in the process ablating the electron and not forming a solvated bubble state.
Interestingly, the results show that prior to the absorption of the second photon the
system relaxes to a metastable state, most likely by vibrational relaxation. Depending
on the photon energy up to 80 meV of energy are to be dissipated into the helium
droplet on a time scale much less than a nanosecond. A quite similar result was found
when studying the silver trimer [184]. Again, excess excitation energy relaxes into a
long living state, the lifetime of which was determined to be 5.7 ± 0.6 ns. The ionization
potential was found to be in accordance with gas-phase experiments; hence direct escape
of the electrons from the droplet without signiﬁcant interaction appears to be the major
channel.

Drabbels and coworkers recently studied photo-electron spectra of aniline attached
to helium nanodroplets [185]. Although the spectra resemble closely that of the gas-
phase, a droplet size-dependent shift was observed, lowering the ionization threshold
upon solvation in the droplets. This shift, which is of the order of 800 cm−1, is assigned
to polarization eﬀects and can be readily estimated from the dielectric constant and
the cluster radius. In terms of resolution the photo-electron peaks are asymmetrically
broadened, showing a tail extending 100 – 300 cm−1 towards lower kinetic energy.
By analyzing the lineshape, droplet size dependent contributions could be extracted.
The results give a linear increase with the droplet radius by 9.8 ± 0.8 cm−1˚A−1.
In
conclusion, the line broadenings due to the surrounding helium droplets are comparable
to achievable width given by a common apparatus function and are not a severe
limitation in applying photo-electron spectroscopy in helium nanodroplets.

5.5. Theory of electrons attached to helium droplets

The already mentioned experimental studies involve ionization processes. In particular
in the case of photo-electron spectroscopy the interaction of the emitted electrons with
the droplet importantly impact the results of the experiments. Jortner and Rosenblit
provided a thorough theoretical study of the energetics and dynamics of electron bubbles
in 4He and 3He droplets [13]. The energetic stability is determined by comparing
the results to the energy of the quasifree electron state V0 with the total energy of
the electron bubble in the ground state Et. The latter includes contributions of the
electronic and reorganization energy. At a cluster size of 6500, V0 was obtained to be
reduced only by less than 10% compared to the bulk value of V0 = 1.06 eV. Decreasing
the droplet size rises the total energy Et of the balloon-like structure continuously. The
minimal droplet size for which an electron bubble is energetically stable was determined
to about N = 5200. For such droplets having a radius of 39 ˚A the radius of the electron
bubble is 13.5 ˚A. An interesting result to point out here is the role of superﬂuidity. The
energetic structure proved to be insensitive to the properties of the superﬂuid, being
nearly identical for 4He below or above the lambda point as well as 3He droplets. Also
the calculated formation time τf of 9 ps of an equilibrium electron bubble conﬁguration is
only weakly aﬀected by superﬂuidity: dissipating eﬀects in normalﬂuid droplets increase
τf by 15%.

On the other hand, the dynamic stability, given by tunneling of the electron into
In normalﬂuid helium the
the vacuum is strongly aﬀected by the superﬂuid phase.
motion in the conﬁning potential of the droplet is highly dissipative and therefore
the electron bubble rests in the center of the droplet [186].
In contrast to that, the
nondissipative motion in a superﬂuid droplet is predicted to decreases the tunneling
lifetime by 20 orders of magnitudes. Apparently τf strongly increases with droplet
size. Finally, deﬁning a dynamic lifetime by τf being longer than the time scale of an
experiment (10−6 s), one obtains a minimal droplet size for dynamic stability of ≈ 6200.
The theoretical picture and the numerical results nicely go along with measurements on
attached electrons to helium droplets and experimentally determined lifetimes [187, 188].
Rosenbilt and Jortner have also analyzed the binding of a free electron to the outer
surface of helium droplets. Above a bulk helium surface, such an electron is weakly
bound by polarization forces. However, due to curvature of the surface in droplets,
the binding energy is expected to be depressed, and a minimum droplet size for a
bound electron state is predicted to be 3 x 105 helium atoms [189]. Such a threshold
is not expected if the droplet contained a positive charge. The hypothetical Rydberg
type state (with principle quantum number ≥ 10) of an electron circulating around a
positively charged droplet, but prevented from neutralization by the helium electron
repulsion, has been named ”Scolium”.

5.6. High resolution electronic spectroscopy

High resolution electronic spectroscopy of doped helium nanodroplets can serve as a
powerful tool not only for obtaining structural information but also to study dynamics
in photo-chemical processes. In particular, charge transfer or proton transfer in complex
systems can be targeted. Often such processes take place in the femtosecond time
regime and real-time pump-probe techniques have been applied in ambient environments
[190, 191, 192, 193]. Since lifetime eﬀects in this domain signiﬁcantly contribute to line
broadenings, frequency domain spectroscopy can be applied as an alternative approach
having advantages e.g. in terms of sensitivity. Limitations lie in the achievable spectral
resolution and the assignment of spectral features. In complex systems this can only
be accomplished in a homogeneous cold ensemble of molecules. Moreover, the eﬃcient
cooling mechanism present in helium nanodroplets allows not only to state selectively
laser-excited molecules but also to observe emission spectra of well-deﬁned states because
vibrational excitations are cooled prior to the radiation decay. The beneﬁt of high
spectral resolution in absorption spectra of complex molecules has been demonstrated
in a number of experiments [194, 7, 195, 196]. In some molecules, the ﬁrst vibrationally
resolved electronic spectra have been recorded [195, 197]. This line of work has been
extended to high-resolution ﬂuorecence emission spectroscopy by Slenczka and coworkers
[198, 199, 200]. Molecules like tetracene, pentacene, perylene and phthalocyanines have
been studied. The results clearly demonstrate discrete and long lived states of the
solvation structure of the surrounding helium matrix. Explicitly, the emission spectra
show contributions from diﬀerent progressions. Since vibrational modes of localized
helium atoms are not expected to exist in superﬂuid helium, the experiments conﬁrm the
existence of a solid like (snowball) solvation shell [199, 200]. Depending on the molecule,
diﬀerent helium layer conﬁgurations have been assigned and relaxation probabilities
were derived. QMC calculations have found two diﬀerent helium solvation structures
for 150 He atoms around phthalocyanine [201]. For pentacene e.g.,the authors found
only a single conﬁguration of the helium layer, independently on the electronic state.
More generally, multiple sharp lines are often observed for each vibronic transition
of polyatomic molecules [50, 93, 172], along with a broad absorption feature to the
blue of the lowest energy sharp transition. The broad peak has been assigned as a
“phonon wing” involving excitation of bulk like phonons and rotons in the droplet
[113]. The additional sharp lines have been assigned in some cases as excitations of
helium vibrations localized in the solvation shell [202, 196] or as zero phonon lines (pure
molecular excitations) of alternative helium structures. The intensity of the zero phonon
line is proportional to the squared overlap of the ground state helium wavefunction
solvated around the ground and the excited state molecule respectively, and thus is
expected to decrease extremely rapidly with increasing solvent reorganization. Hole
burning experiments as well as dispersed emission as described above can be used to
assign peaks to diﬀerent solvation structures (as was ﬁrst done in the spectrum of
tetracene [203, 204]), but this requires the structures to have a lifetime longer than the

Spectroscopy and dynamics in helium nanodroplets

34

excitation laser pulses.
It is worth noting that the localized vibrations and diﬀerent
isomers can be viewed as points on a continuum. As helium density in the ﬁrst solvent
shell increases, one or more helium mode become “soft” and move down in excitation
energy below the roton energy (where it belongs based upon its wavelength). As the
density further increases, the “soft” mode can become an unstable mode with multiple
minima. The later can be viewed as a result of freezing of the highly compacted ﬁrst
solvation shell due to strong He–He repulsion.

Generally, the resolution of electronic spectra has not been suﬃciently high to
allow the resolution of rotational structure. An exception is glyoxal [205] for which a
surprisingly large change in rotational constants upon electronic excitation was observed
an attributed to be primarily due to changes in helium solvation structure. The zero
phonon spectrum of phthalocyanine was studied with 1 MHz resolution and found not
to have any evidence of rotational structure [206]. This work determined that the
experimental width of the zero phonon line was dominated by the inhomogeneous size
distribution of the droplets, even for the largest droplets that could be formed. The
asymptotic shift with droplet size is expected to be proportional to the droplet helium
number and the change in helium-molecule C6 coeﬃcient. The latter is typically much
larger for electronic than vibrational excitation, thus making droplet size inhomogeneous
eﬀects more important in electronic than vibrational spectroscopy [207].

HENDI has also been used to study the electronic spectroscopy of complexes formed
inside the helium droplets. Additional rare gas atoms such as Ar are often used [50],
since it is common to have jet spectra of such complexes to compare to. Recent examples
include the study of tetracene with H2, D2 (ortho and para forms), and HD [208]. They
discovered multiple isomers of each complex, some of which were not observed in free jet
spectroscopy of the same complexes. It was recently observed that the beam depletion
spectrum of perylene when complexed with O2 was much stronger than expected based
upon the Poisson distribution and this was attributed to increased quenching and thus
greater heat release per excitation [209]. This suggests that comparison of LIF and
depletion spectra could be used to determine quantum yields for emission in helium. A
recent study reported the UV spectrum of benzene and the benzene dimer in helium
[210]. The monomer was found to have a larger blue shift (30 cm−1). In a more recent
measurements on ﬁve substituted benzene molecules, it was found that their blue shifts
(and that of benzene) was highly correlated with calculated changes in the electron
density on the aromatic ring [211]. Curtis et al. [212] found a ≈ 1 cm−1 blue shift for
the benzene transitions when they are observed using two photon ionization detection
compared to detection by LIF or beam depletion [210].
It is likely that this reﬂects
the REMPI detection being sensitive to the detection of smaller droplets for which the
electron has a higher probability of escaping. The benzene dimer was found to have the
same spectroscopic structure as previously found in the gas phase, but compressed [210].
Remarkably, helium solvation was found to substantially inhibit excimer formation upon
S1 excitation, a process that occurs in a few psec for the isolated dimer in the gas
phase. Krasnokutski et al. [213] have reported the spectrum of anthracene in helium,

Spectroscopy and dynamics in helium nanodroplets

thus completing the observation of the series of one to ﬁve fused benzene rings in a
line. Huang et al.
[94] have done QMC calculations of the interaction of helium (up
to 24 atoms) with these “nanosurfaces” and ﬁnd strong localization of helium in the
ﬁrst solvent layer above and below the rings. Pendular state spectroscopy has been
observed for 9-cyanoanthracene in helium using ﬁelds up to 200 kV/cm, achieving what
the authors report to be the highest degree of alignment yet obtained [214]. It is likely
that such spectra could provide measurements of the moments of inertia of such large
molecules in helium since the pendular frequencies will depend upon these moments.

One of our groups (FS) introduced the possibility of studying charge transfer
and life time eﬀects in doped helium nanodroplets when probing e.g. 3,4,9,10-
perylenetetracarboxylic-dianhydrid (PTCDA) complexes [40, 197]. Only the high
selectivity of molecular transitions attained in helium droplets allows for a detailed
analysis on excitonic transitions and a determination of their life times. Evaluating the
spectral widths, a dephasing time of ca. 10 fs was deduced. Analysis of line shapes in 3-
hydroxyﬂavon have been performed by Slenczka and coworkers [215]. They determined
the proton back transfer of tautomers of 3-hydroxyﬂavon into its normal form in 250 fs.
Furthermore, the inﬂuence of a polar solvent environment by adding water molecules
was probed. Note that these experiments have full control on the size of the additional
water complexes.

5.7. Optically selected mass spectroscopy in helium nanodroplets

There is a long history to the study of electron impact ionization of helium nanodroplets,
of which we cite only some of the most recent [216, 217]. The Miller group introduced a
new approach that dramatically cleans up many of the ambiguities of previous work, by
looking only at the modulation in the mass spectrum induced when a IR transition
of a particular species is pumped [218]. This allowed,
for the ﬁrst time, reliable
absolute branching ratios between diﬀerent mass (ion products) to be determined, from
droplets with a known composition. The work reﬁned the ion hopping probability,
and demonstrated that there is a long range steering, such that the He cation ion
preferentially approaches the negative parts of the molecule, leading to regio-selective
ionization. Fragmentation after ionization was studied for HCN [219] and the large
organic molecule, triphenyl-methanol [220].

5.8. IR-IR double resonance

The high power available from OPO’s has been exploited by the Miller group to use
IR-IR double resonance to study dynamical behavior in helium nanodroplets. The C-H
stretching spectrum of cyanoacetylene (HCCCN) was studied as a test case [221]. A
high power 3 micron OPO was used as a pump and a lower power F-center laser used
as a tunable probe of the spectrum ≈ 175 µs after the the pump, suﬃcient time to
allow evaporative cooling to eﬀectively ﬁnish. As expected, a saturation hole in the
probe absorption was induced by the pump. However, this was narrower than the one

Spectroscopy and dynamics in helium nanodroplets

36

photon transition and an increase in absorption (a “hill’) was observed slightly higher in
wavenumber. The interpretation is that the cluster size distribution makes a signiﬁcant
contribution to the width of the single resonance spectrum, and that there is a blue
shift of the absorption spectrum due to the evaporation of ≈ 660 helium atoms induced
by the pump laser absorption.
It should also be recognized that the total angular
momentum will be conserved in the droplets and that the initial absorption will lead to
a reduction in the angular momentum trapped in the droplets following initial pickup,
so that change in the droplet spectrum may not reﬂect only the change in mean size.

In a subsequent study, Miller and coworkers used double resonance to study
the IR induced isomerization between the linear HCN–HF and the bent HF–HCN
complexes [222]. Both complexes are formed upon joint pickup of HCN and HF [223],
and in each isomer both the C-H and F-H stretching modes were observed. Excitation
of the lower energy HCN–HF complex resulted in branching probabilities of 58% to
produce HCN–HF absorption in a smaller droplet and 29% to produce absorption of
the higher energy HF–HCN isomer. The results are interpreted to result from photo-
dissociation of the complex after IR absorption (which is commonly observed for isolated
complexes) followed by recombination, much as in the initial formation process of the
complex following pickup. The ≈ 13% loss of intensity was attributed to droplets lost
from the detector due to the increased transverse momentum of the droplets produced
by the evaporative cooling.
In particular, no evidence was found for an IR induced
absorption of the isolated HCN or HF molecules in the droplets, which implies that
ejection of one of the monomers due to the translational energy imparted upon photo-
dissociation is at most a minor channel. Pumping the vibrations of the higher energy
HF–HCN isomer, in contrast, lead to quantitative transfer of the population to the lower
energy HCN-HF isomer. Two mechanisms where proposed to explain this result. One
is that for this complex, vibrational energy redistribution (IVR) is suﬃciently fast that
photo-dissociation does not take place. Instead, one creates a vibrationally hot molecule
with energy well above the isomerization barrier, and that this cools suﬃciently slowly
that the system anneals to the lowest minimum structure. The alternative is that
photo-dissociation does take place but produces a vibrationally excited product that
does not relax until after recombination. The subsequent vibrational relaxation of
the complex then leads to annealing. Time resolved pump-probe spectroscopy, with
suﬃcient time resolution to ‘catch’ the absorption spectrum of the fragments before
geminal recombination is clearly needed to resolve this ambiguity in the mechanism.

5.9. Complex formation in helium droplets

Helium nanodroplet spectroscopy has been used to study complexes since the ﬁrst IR
spectral study by Goyal et al. [1]. Here, we will restrict discussion to work that have
appeared since the entire ﬁeld was reviewed in the special issue on helium nanodroplets
that appeared in the Journal of Chemical Physics in late 2001.

The study of weakly bound complexes formed in supersonic expansions is a well

Spectroscopy and dynamics in helium nanodroplets

37

established method that has provided great insight into noncovalent interactions between
molecules. Likewise, study of the IR spectra of complexes trapped in cryogenic matrices,
particularly Ar and Ne, is also a well established technique. Study of complexes in helium
oﬀers several features that compliment these other methods. For one, the long range
“steering” of molecules when formed in helium can lead to the selective production of
structures that are not formed signiﬁcantly in jets or classical matrices. The cooling
provided by the helium allows the quenching of complexes in higher energy structures
that are separated by even modest barriers from the global minimum structure. The
most dramatic example of this is the formation of long, polar complexes of HCN and
HCCCN [224, 78]. A more recent example is the exclusive formation of a “open” polar
form of formic acid dimer [225]. Such barriers are particularly important when preformed
hydrogen bonded rings must be broken up to reach the minimum energy structure for
the next larger complex. In a study of the growth of HF polymers in helium, it was
found that a cyclic tetramer is formed (which requires insertion into the cyclic trimer),
but that the ﬁfth HF is not able to enter the ring and thus leads to a polar pentamer
[226]. The formation of cyclic water complexes has also been studied [227, 228]. For
the complex of HF and HCN, both hydrogen bonded complexes are formed in helium
[223] while only the lower energy HCN–HF complex is observed in jet spectroscopy. In
contrast to that, for complexes between HCCH and HF only the “T” shaped isomer
is observed in helium despite a predicted minimum in the HCCH-FH structure [226].
It is presumed that the later is shallow enough that the system can tunnel out of this
minimum even if initially populated. It has been demonstrated that helium can trap
and allow the study of “entrance channel complexes” (Cl, Br, I)–HF [229].

Helium nanodroplets are particularly suited for the study of molecules bound to
small metal clusters grown inside the droplet. The Miller group has published several
papers reporting the IR spectra of HCN [47, 48, 230], HCCCN [231], and HCCH [232]
complexed with Mg atoms and small clusters. Strongly nonadditive shifts in the IR
fundamental transition of the molecules are suggestive to changes in the bonding of the
Mg clusters, particularly upon going from Mg3 to Mg4 [230].

The Toennies-Vilesov group published an important series of papers on the IR
spectra of OCS complexed with diﬀerent numbers of hydrogen and its isotopomers
[56, 233, 58, 234]. A controversial ﬁnding of this work is certain para-H2 clusters become
superﬂuid between the temperatures of 0.37 K (found in 4He droplets) and 0.15 K (found
in mixed 3He/4He droplets). The principle observation supporting this interpretation is
the loss of Q branches in the spectrum of these complexes when upon cooling. Paesani
et al.
[235, 143] have performed theoretical calculations that provide support for this
interpretation. One of us (KL) and others have argued that this observation is consistent
with a set of pH2 rings that can internally rotate (cyclic exchange) and the expected
spin statistical weights of the internal rotation levels [6]. A later paper from Toennies
and Vilesov [58] reached substantially the same conclusion. It is a semantic question
whether such 1-D rotations should be considered as “superﬂuid”.

The Miller group has studied HCN [51, 236, 55, 52] and HF [237] complexed with

Spectroscopy and dynamics in helium nanodroplets

38

ortho and para H2 and D2, and with HD, including mixed clusters. Perhaps the
most important result of this work is the study of HCN-(HD)n complexes, where Q
branches were found to disappear for n = 12 and 13 and reappear for n = 14 [52].
This was interpreted as due to the formation of cages which nearly isotropic potentials
for HCN rotation for the n=12 and 13 cases. Since HD is a composite Fermion, it is
clear that the disappearance of Q branches in the IR spectrum cannot be viewed as
conclusive experimental evidence for formation of superﬂuid solvation shells, no matter
how liberally one wants to interpret that phase.

5.10. IR spectra of isolated molecules

The bulk of more recent IR studies of isolated molecules have focused on probing the
interactions between the molecule and the helium solvent and the dynamics that are
produced. Several studies have explored enhanced line broadening in IR spectra that
reﬂect rapid, solvent induced relaxation, often facilitated by intramolecular anharmonic
resonances. Madeja et al. studied the spectrum of h(2)- and d(1)- Formic Acid in the
spectral region of the O-H and C-H stretching vibrations, as well as several combination
bands that gain intensity through Fermi and Coriolis resonances [238]. Lindsay and
Miller studied the C-H stretching fundamental spectrum of ethylene [239], while Scheele
et al. studied the ﬁrst C-H stretching overtone region of the same molecule [240]. This
work again demonstrated extreme variation in broadening between diﬀerent vibrational
bands. Slipchenko and Vilesov have re-examined the 3 micron spectrum of NH3 [241],
greatly extending a previous, lower resolution study [242]. This work demonstrated that
the rotational constants (B and C) are reduced by only 5% compared to the gas-phase
values and that the inversion splitting is within 6% of the gas phase value. The later
is perhaps surprising in that one would expect a signiﬁcant change in helium solvation
upon inversion, therebye increasing the tunneling mass.

The Havenith group has studied the fundamental IR spectra of both NO [243] and
CO [244] in helium. In the case of NO, they found that the rotational spacing between
the lowest two levels was 76% of the corresponding gas phase value, demonstrating
that this molecule is in the “intermediate following” limit, as had previously been
experimentally demonstrated for HCN and DCN [136]. For the Q(0.5) 2Π1/2 transition
(between the lowest rotational levels of each vibrational state), the transitions are quite
narrow and laser limited (≈ 150 MHz FWHM), and they were able to resolve both the
Λ doubling and hyperﬁne splittings. The hyperﬁne interaction constant is unchanged
in helium, demonstrating the small eﬀect of the helium on the electronic density of the
NO molecule. The Λ doubling constant is increased by 55% compared to the gas phase.
This is the opposite eﬀect from that expected based upon the change in B value and
also the expected increase in the Rydberg type excited states. These authors point
out that 90% of the Λ doubling arises from mixing in of excited 2Σ valence states,
which are expected to be only weakly shifted in helium. The authors suggest that
conﬁnement of the unpaired electron by the helium may increase the matrix element

Spectroscopy and dynamics in helium nanodroplets

39

< Σ|Ly|Π > (which appears in the expression for the Λ doubling splitting). They oﬀer
as an additional possible source for the increased Λ doubling helium density ﬂuctuations
in the helium droplet that slightly perturb the rotational symmetry around the NO axis.
For a rigid NO in a 2Π state, the helium density should undergo Jahn-Teller distortion
leading to a diﬀerence in helium density in the nodal plane of the Π orbital compared to
that perpendicular to it, i.e. leading to the anisotropy of helium density that the authors
predict. For the Q(1.5) transition, the ﬁne and Λ doubling splittings are unresolved,
and the transition is Lorentzian with a FWHM of 1.05 GHz, which suggests that the
upper rotational state relaxes with a population lifetime of 152 ps. This is a relatively
fast decay (for helium). Rotational relaxation J ′ = 1.5 → 0.5 will liberate 4.965 cm−1
of energy, well below the energy required to produce a roton (≈ 6 cm−1 in bulk helium).
The authors attribute this broadening as due to coupling of the NO rotation to droplet
phonons. As discussed above and also by the authors in their CO paper (see below),
one must assume that the phonons are themselves coupled to some much higher density
of states in order to rationalize the observed smooth Lorentzian lineshape.

In the IR spectrum of CO, only the R(0) line could be observed due to the low
temperature of the droplets relative to the rotational spacing. However, by observing
the same transition in four isotopic species (12C16O, 13C16O 12C18O, and 13C18O) and
exploiting the diﬀerent reduced mass dependence for the respective constants, the shifts
for both the vibrational frequency and rotational constant (more properly the J =
0 to 1 spacing) were deduced. The rotational constant of 12C16O is 62.9% of the
gas phase value, conﬁrming that CO is also an intermediate following molecule. The
authors point out that this reduction is larger (in percent) than that of HCN (79%),
despite the fact that the gas phase rotational constant of CO (1.922 cm−1) is larger
than that of HCN (1.478 cm−1). This is attributed as due to a signiﬁcantly higher
anisotropy of the interaction potential of CO with He compared to that of HCN with
He. Quantum Monte Carlo calculations on clusters CO-HeN (N=1-30) by Cazzato et
al. [146] rotational excitation energies combined with vibrational shift calculations by
Paesani and Gianturco [245] are in excellent agreement with IR experiments on such
cluster sizes [246]. These calculations found that the rotational excitation energy was
almost constant after completion of the ﬁrst helium solvation shell (N=14), and by
extrapolation predicted a nanodroplet B value 78% of the gas phase value, considerably
larger than what was found [244]. von Haeften et al. interpret this extra reduction as due
to interaction of the CO rotation with long wavelength phonons in the droplet which are
not present in the small clusters. This is supported by calculations using the CBF/DMC
method [153]. These calculations predict a nanodroplet CO rotational excitation 69%
of the gas phase value (compared with 63% inferred from the experiment).

For all four isotopic species of CO, the R(0) transitions exhibit Lorentzian lineshapes
with FWHM of 1.02 GHz, almost identical to that observed for the NO Q(1.5) transition.
In the CO case, the energy released upon rotational relaxation is only 2.2 cm−1, well
below the energy of both roton formation and quantum evaporation (4.4 cm−1 for
droplets of 2 600 helium atoms). The CBF/DMC calculations (which treat the phonons

Spectroscopy and dynamics in helium nanodroplets

40

as continuous instead of discrete as they are in nanodroplets) predict a homogeneous
width of 0.54 GHz, approximately one half the observed value. The authors discuss the
fact that the phonons alone cannot provide the needed quasi-continuum to produce a
homogeneously broadened line of 1 GHz width. They report that if one includes all
the states generated by coupling of droplet phonons and center of mass motion states
[108] for the CO, this produces a density of about 10 states per linewidth of the CO
transition. They assign the line broadening as arising from inelastic relaxation of the
excited J = 1 level of CO into J = 0 levels of CO with production of excitation in mixed
phonon/center of mass motion states. No mechanism was proposed for the coupling
that would produce such simultaneous excitation of phonons and translational motion.
We would like to note that such a coupling is higher order and thus likely weaker than
the direct coupling of the rotor to the phonons. The center of mass motion potential is
nearly harmonic and thus strong propensity rules for its change in quantum numbers are
expected. We would also like to point out that elastic orientational relaxation (changes
in the M quantum number) will also lead to line broadening in the IR spectrum and this
is most eﬀective for low J states [247]. The ripplon states excited in the droplets (and
the translational motion states) have a high degeneracy in the harmonic limit and these
could couple to the angular momentum of the molecule (as was explicitly calculated
for HCN in [108]). Time resolved pump/probe experiments with polarized light could
provide unambiguous determination of the relative contributions of elastic, inelastic,
and pure dephasing contributions to the homogeneous broadening in the spectrum of
CO and other molecules.

Nauta and Miller reported the spectra of diacetylene and cyclopropane [248]. In
both cases, the rotational constants are the factor of ≈ 3 smaller than the corresponding
gas phase values expected for heavy rotors. The asymmetric C-H stretch of diacetylene
shows a small vibrational origin red shift (-0.304 cm−1) in contrast to the small blue shift
(+0.13 cm−1) observed for the corresponding band of acetylene. Rotational independent
linebroading with FWHM of 1.6 GHz is observed § which is attributed to vibrational
relaxation. For the observed ν8 C-H stretching mode of cyclopropane, the fundamental
wavenumber is blue shifted by +4.069 cm−1, rather a large vibrational shift. K¨upper et
al. obtained the 3 µm ν1 spectrum of propargyl radical, formed from a pyrolysis source
[37]. The authors provided the ﬁrst experimental determination of the dipole moment
(-0.15 Debye) of this important free radical species. Stiles et al. [249] carefully studied
the Stark eﬀect to determine the eﬀective dipole moments in helium of HCN (2.949(6)
compared to 3.01746 Debye in gas phase) HCCCN (3.58(8) compared with 3.73172 Debye
for gas phase). This work demonstrates for the ﬁrst time the perturbation that helium
spectroscopy introduces into the determination of dipole moments. The authors found
that these small shifts in the eﬀective dipole moments could be accounted for by helium
polarization, using an elliptical cavity model with realistic parameters.

§ Note that there is a typographic error in the unit of the linewidth reported in Table 1 of this paper,
as inspection of the simulated spectrum presented in ﬁgure 1 makes obvious. The unit should read
cm−1, not MHz.

The Vilesov group has used an OPO and H2 crystal Raman shifting of the OPO
to reexamine the IR spectra of several simple molecules, including H2O, NH3, and
In the case of H2O [250], they have found that all the monomer transitions
CO2.
can be assigned (three from the ν3 band and two from the ν1 band) start from the
lowest ortho and para rotational levels. Transitions previously assigned to higher lying
rotational levels of H2O (which would imply incomplete rotational relaxation) were
established to be water dimer transitions. From the limited number of transitions, only
one combination diﬀerence could formed (between the 202 and 000 levels in the ν3 excited
state) and this diﬀers by only 0.5% from the corresponding gas phase value, indicative
of the tiny eﬀect helium has on the rotational constants of H2O. The three transitions
to levels that are symmetry allowed to undergo rotational relaxation have FWHM’s
between 2.3-3.0 cm−1, which implies lifetimes of 2 ps. The two transitions that go to the
lowest ortho or para rotational level in the excited vibrational state have nearly laser
limited linewidths of 0.34 cm−1. Saturation measurements indicate that the excited state
vibrational relaxation lifetime is at least 7 ns, the length of the excitation pulse.

Slipchenko and Vilesov [241] observed the 3 µm spectrum of NH3 and observed
a total of ten transitions in the ν1, ν3, 2ν4(l = 0), and 2ν4(l = 2) vibrational bands.
They also reassigned an earlier spectrum observed in the ν2 umbrella fundamental. Like
for H2O, transitions only come from the lowest rotational level for the ortho and para
species, though the upper tunneling level of the J = K = 1 level is weakly populated.
All transitions are close to the gas phase values, and ﬁts (which require some constraints
given the few transitions observable) predict B and C rotational constants ≈95% of the
gas phase values, as expected for such a light rotor (B = 9.96 cm−1). The sum of the
tunneling splitting of the ground and excited ν1 state was found to be 1.67(5) compared
to a gas phase value of 1.78 cm−1, indicating a small perturbation on the inversion
frequency, especially compared to the previous analysis of the ν2 spectrum. Again, as in
the case of H2O, transitions to levels that have symmetry allowed rotational relaxation
channels are broadened, indicating lifetimes of 1-7 ps, while transitions to levels with
only vibrationally inelastic decay channels have nearly laser limited widths of 0.33 cm−1
FWHM. This includes the sQ(1,1) level which could relax via relaxation by transition
to the lower tunneling inversion level (a → s) in the excited state.

Hoshina et al. [251] recently reported observation of a “phonon wing” in the R(0)
absorption of CO2 in the fundamental band [251]. All previous IR spectra were assigned
to pure excitation of the solute molecule, but observations of phonon wings are quite
common in electronic spectra in helium. The strength of the phonon wing reﬂects
changes in the helium solvation structure upon excitation, which are expected to be
much larger upon electronic than vibrational excitation. The large cross section of the
CO2 fundamental band combined with the high peak power of the pulsed laser source
used allowed the broad, phonon wing to be brought up in intensity by saturation of
the pure molecular excitation (zero phonon line). These authors further reported that
the fractional intensity in the phonon side band can be predicted using a “Toy model”
of a rigid, planar ring of helium atoms coupled to the rotation of the molecule [252].

Spectroscopy and dynamics in helium nanodroplets

42

This suggests that in this case that the phonon wing does not arise from the changes
in helium solvation structure upon vibrational excitation, but rather due the rotational
excitation of the molecule and its coupling to helium rotation of in the ﬁrst solvent shell.
A prediction of this model for the phonon sideband is that the relative strength should
be very weakly dependent upon the degree of vibrational excitation and also that the
phonon sideband should be predictably stronger for the R(1) transition, which could be
observed in the C18O2 isotopic species.

5.11. Small helium clusters

While outside the formal scope of this review, we would like to close by brieﬂy reporting
on important recent work on helium clusters smaller than those we have considered until
now.

Toennies and coworkers have continued to study small 4He and mixed 3He/4He
clusters using transmission diﬀraction gratings to spatially resolve clusters by mass as
they introduced in [253]. Recently, they reported enhanced production of 4He clusters
with certain “magic number” sizes (N = 10-11, 14, 22, 26-27, and 44 atoms) [254]. This
was quite surprising as the best DMC calculations [255] indicate that no enhanced stable
clusters should exist based upon their ground state energy. However, the magic number
clusters are predicted to have reduced Free energy due to the creation of additional
stable ripplon modes as the clusters grow [254].

Particularly germane to the subject of this review is a series of papers reporting
the IR (McKellar Group) and microwave spectra (J¨ager group) of a simple molecules
with growing numbers of helium atoms. These include OCS [256, 257, 258], NNO [259],
CO2 [260, 261], and CO [246, 262]. They have been able to follow how the spectra
evolve as helium atoms increasingly solvate the molecules, following the spectra up to
N = 19 for the cases of CO and NNO. For the cases besides CO, the ﬁrst helium atoms
strongly bind to the side of the linear molecules and a fairly rigid ring builds up. The
moments of inertia are close to the classical values and raise with increasing number
of helium atoms. However, once this ring is saturated, the additional helium atoms
become more loosely bound, primarily on the ends of the molecules. This opens up the
possibility of quantum exchange and leads to a decrease in the moment of inertia as more
helium atoms are added. In detail, the rotational constants have a complex and highly
structured evolution with number of helium atoms which provides a window into the
changing rotational dynamics. It is clear that the convergence to the nanodroplet limit is
quite slow with a lot of road to be yet explored. Particularly insightful have been a series
of DMC calculations that have extracted the excitation energies by ﬁts to the imaginary
time correlation function for the rotor orientation [144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 141, 142, 143].
These have been in quantitative agreement with the experiments, nearly reproducing
every detail of the changes of rotational constant with N.

6. Conclusions

As we hope this review makes clear, the ﬁeld of helium nanodroplet spectroscopy is
advancing rapidly, and much has been learned in the past years. The ﬁeld is mature in
the sense that many of the basic spectroscopic properties of molecules solvated in helium
can now be predicted. The location and binding of a given solute at the surface or in
the bulk of the droplets is well conceived as well as the temperature determination and
cooling mechanisms. We have a good understanding of the size of helium perturbations
to the spectroscopic constants of the molecule, though we still lack generally predictive
theories. We have learned how to exploit the unique properties of helium droplets to
make novel chemical species and probe them in new ways. However, our understanding
of the dynamical coupling of the solute to the helium remains limited. Ultrafast
pump-probe experiments have provided the ﬁrst direct view into the reorganization
of the helium solvent following photo-excitation. Moreover, several recent pump-probe
experiments done with nsec and even cw lasers have also provided windows into the
dynamics of molecules in helium on times scales longer than accessible with ultrashort
pulses. The feasibility to study complex dynamical processes is demonstrated in the
mentioned experiments, but much more can and needs to be done. In particular, we
look forward towards the development of time resolved state-to-state measurements
that will reveal the detailed ﬂow of molecules through state space as they relax in this
quantum solvent.

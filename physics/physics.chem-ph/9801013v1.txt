I. INTRODUCTION

In recent years, algebraic models, such as Lie algebraic methods (Iachello and Levine, 1995; Bijker

et al., 1995) and the boson-realization model (Ma et al., 1996), have been proposed for descriptions

of vibrations, rotations, and rotation-vibration interactions in polyatomic molecules. Lie algebraic

methods for diatomic molecules have been modiﬁed by the corresponding quantum algebra (Alvarez

et al., 1994; Chang, 1995), and the boson-realization model have been developed for the higher

vibrational states of polyatomic molecules in terms of q-deformed oscillators (Xie et al., 1996; Hou et

al., 1997).

In Lie algebraic approaches, U(4) and U(2) algebraic model have been extensively used. The U(4)

model took the rotation and the vibration into account simultaneously but became quite complicated

when the number of atoms in a molecule increased to larger than four. The U(2) model was par-

ticularly successful in explaining stretching vibrations of polyatomic molecules such as benzene-like

and octahedral systems (Iachello and Oss, 1991; Chen et al., 1996). This model was extended to deal

with both stretching and bending vibrations in triatomic molecules (Frank et al., 1996). Recently, a

U(5) algebraic model was introduced for higher excited stretching modes and infrared intensities of

tetrahedral molecules (Leroy et al., 1996; Leroy and Boujut, 1997). However, the U(5) model was less

feasible than the U(2) model when the bending vibrations were considered.

In this paper, we will use the U(2) algebraic model to study the stretching vibrations and intensities

of infrared transition of silane SiH4 and silicon tetraﬂuoride SiF4. Our results are quite good in

comparison with those of the U(5) algebraic model for SiH4 (Leroy et al., 1996) and the local mode

model (Della Valle, 1988). Results for stretching and bending vibrations in the U(2) model and the

boson-realization model will be presented in a subsequent publication.

II. U(2) ALGEBRAIC MODEL

For a tetrahedral molecule XY4, we introduce four U(2) algebras to describe the vibrations of four

X-Y bonds. The molecular dynamical group is

U1(2) ⊗ U2(2) ⊗ U3(2) ⊗ U4(2),

where each Ui(2) (1 ≤ i ≤ 4) is generated by the operators { ˆNi, ˆJ+,i ˆJ−,i, ˆJ0,i}, satisfying the following
commutation relations (Frank et al., 1996):

[ ˆJ0,i, ˆJ±,j] = ±δij ˆJ±,i,
[ ˆNi, ˆJ0,j] = 0,

[ ˆJ+,i, ˆJ−,j] = 2δij ˆJ0,i,
[ ˆNi, ˆJ±,j] = 0.

where ˆNi is related with the Casimir operator of U(2):

2 ˆJ 2

0,i + ˆJ+,i ˆJ−,i + ˆJ−,i ˆJ+,i = ˆNi( ˆNi/2 + 1).

Denote by vi the number of quanta in the ith bond. The local basis states for each bond are labeled
by the eigenvalue Ni of ˆNi and vi, and written as |Ni, vii. Their products provide the local bases:

|N1, v1i|N2, v2i|N3, v3i|N4, v4i ≡ |Ni, vii.

where those Ni are equal to each other, Ni = N , due to equivalent bonds .

There are three kinds of O(2) invariant combinations of those generators:

ˆHi = ( ˆJ+,i ˆJ−,i + ˆJ−,i, ˆJ+,i)/2 − ˆNi/2,
ˆHij = 2 ˆJ0,i ˆJ0,j − ˆNi ˆNj/2,
ˆVij = ˆJ+,i ˆJ−,j + ˆJ−,i ˆJ+,j,

i 6= j,

i 6= j.

(1)

Their matrix elements in the local bases are given by Frank et al. (1996). The operator ˆHi corresponds
to the energy of the ith Morse oscillator. The operators ˆHij describe the anharmonic terms with the
type vivj , while the operators ˆVij describe the interbond couplings which, in conﬁguration space, are
of the type rirj, where ri and rj are the displacement vectors of bonds i and j from their equilibrium

The Hamiltonian, if restricted at the quadratic terms, is expressed in terms of those three kinds of

positions.

where all λ’s are the coupling parameters. The Hamiltonian preserves the quantum number V = P vi.
We now apply this model to study the stretching vibrational spectra of SiH4 and SiF4. The calcu-

lation for energy levels has been greatly simpliﬁed since the symmetrized bases are used. The boson

number N is taken to be 60 for SiH4, and 100 for SiF4.

For SiH4, we choose ﬁve parameters, the same as the number of parameters used by Leroy et al.

(1996), to calculate the vibrational levels. It was found that these ﬁve parameters λj, 1 ≤ j ≤ 5,

can give better results. That means to set λi=0, 6 ≤ i ≤ 18. Fitting the observed data for SiH4

from the compilation of Leroy et al. (1996), we obtain the parameter values and the calculated energy

levels, listed in Table I. For SiF4, the better results can be obtained in terms of only three parameters

λ1, λ2, and λ3. Its observed data from McDowell et al. (1982), calculated values, and corresponding

parameters are also listed in Table I. For comparison, the levels for the two molecules calculated by

the local model model (LMM) (Della Valle, 1988) and the recently calculated results for SiH4 by the

U(5) model (U(5)M) (Leroy et al., 1996) are given in Table I, together with their standard deviations

(SD). The calculated vibrational energy levels given in Table I are the diﬀerences between the observed

values and the calculated ones.

III. INTENSITIES OF INFRARED TRANSITION

In the following we will introduce infrared transition operator. The calculated intensities can be

used to check assignments and to study the intramolecular energy relaxation in tetrahedral molecules.

For the considered systems, the infrared active mode is F2. The absolute absorption intensities

from a state v′ to v are given by

Ivv′ = νvv′ Pvv′ ,
Pvv′ = |hv| ˆTx|v′i|2 + |hv| ˆTy|v′i|2 + |hv| ˆTz|v′i|2,

where νvv′ is the frequency of the observed transition, ˆTx, ˆTy, and ˆTz correspond to the three com-
ponents of the infrared transition operator ˆT , and the state |vi denotes |Ni, vii for short. All other
constants are absorbed in the normalization of the operator ˆT . The three components of ˆT are

where α is the parameter. The matrix elements of ˆti are taken to be (Iachello and Oss, 1993)

ˆTx = α (ˆt1 − ˆt2 + ˆt3 − ˆt4),
ˆTy = α (ˆt1 − ˆt2 − ˆt3 + ˆt4),
ˆTz = α (ˆt1 + ˆt2 − ˆt3 − ˆt4),

h ˆNi, vi|ˆti| ˆNi, v′

ii = exp(−βi|vi − v′

i|).

Those βi for equivalent bonds are equal to each other, and denoted by a common symbol β.

The two parameters in the transition operator of (4) and (5) will be determined by ﬁtting observed

data. Due to the Wigner-Eckart theorem, it is suﬃcient to calculate only the z component of the
transition operator, ˆTz, in the symmetrized bases. In Table II we only list part of calculated intensities

to compare with known observed data, from that the two parameters are determined. The standard

deviation in our ﬁtting is 1.265 for SiH4, and 2.512 for SiF4, while that was 1.415 for SiH4 by Leroy

et al. (1996).

We have used a U(2) algebraic model for studying the stretching vibrations and infrared intensities

of a tetrahedral molecule. The model Hamiltonian and the model transition operator have provided

better ﬁts to the published experimental data of silane and silicon tetraﬂuoride than the local mode

U(2) algebraic model can be applied to the stretching and bending vibrations of other medium-size

and large molecules. Furthermore, this model can be studied by the corresponding quantum algebra

(Bonatsos and Daskaloyannis, 1993). Investigations on those subjects are under way.

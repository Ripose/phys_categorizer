Abstract

We report the ﬁrst results of relativistic correlation calculation of the spectroscopic properties for

the ground state of E112H and its cation in which spin-orbit interaction is taken into account non-

perturbatively. Studying the properties of superheavy element 112 (eka-Hg) is required for reliable

chemical identiﬁcation of its long-lived isotope, 283112, ﬁrst of all. Most advanced ab initio methods

are used to provide high accuracy. It is shown that appropriate accounting for the spin-orbit eﬀects

leads to dramatic change of spectroscopic properties of E112H whereas they are not so important

for E112H+. As a result, the calculated equilibrium distance, Rcalc

smaller than Rexpt

e =(1.738 ± 0.003) ˚A and Rcalc

in HgH, whereas the dissociation energy, Dcalc

e =1.662 ˚A, in E112H is notably
e =1.738 ˚A (studied within similar approximations)
e =0.42 eV, in E112H is close to Dexpt

e =0.46 eV and

Dcalc

e =0.41 eV in HgH. These data are quite diﬀerent from the values previously obtained within

the scalar-relativistic Douglas-Kroll approximation for E112H [Nakajima and Hirao, Chem. Phys.

Lett., 329, 511 (2000)], RNH

e =1.829 ˚A and DNH

e =0.06 eV. Our results indicate that E112 should

not be expected as “more inert” than Hg in opposite to that suggested earlier.

Introduction. The superheavy element 112 (eka-Hg) was discovered at GSI Darmstadt in

1996 within the “cold” fusion reaction [1]. In the “hot” fusion experiment at FLNR Dubna,

a volatile long-lived spontaneously ﬁssioning species was observed three years later [2] that

was attributed to 283112 with half-life (81+147

−32 ) sec. The recent observation at FLNR of the
“α–SF” chain, attributed to 4 sec α-decay branch of 283112 followed by a 0.2 sec spontaneous

ﬁssion of 279110 (Ds) [3], brought up the question, what species was observed in the ﬁrst

FLNR experiment. Moreover, the production of 283112 in the reaction of 48Ca and 238U

was not conﬁrmed at LBNL Berkeley [4]. However, a very speciﬁc decay mode of the short

“α–SF” chain oﬀered the unique chance to unambiguously identify 283112 in a chemistry

experiment.

of E112 as well.

It was predicted in 1975 by Pitzer [5] that E112 behaves rather like a rare gas than

Hg, however, he restricted his consideration by the implicit suggestion that E112 forms two

σ bonds. The ﬁrst attempt to identify E112 chemically was made at FLNR [6, 7] but no

spontaneous ﬁssions were detected that was interpreted as indication of the Rn-like behavior

The chemical experiments on studying properties of E112 are currently under way at

FLNR [7], similar work is in progress at GSI and PSI Villigen [8] that involves the at-

tempt to clarify the recent observation of the decay chains and ﬁssion products associated

with the production of E114 and E116 [3]: being their decay product, E112 should be de-

tectable in gas-phase chromatographic experiments. The experimental study of superheavy

element (SHE) properties is very diﬃcult because of their extremely small quantities, only

single atoms are available for research. In this connection, theoretical predictions of their

properties based on benchmark ab initio calculations are highly desirable. As a ﬁrst step

in the extensive study of chemistry of E112, bonding in simple diatomic molecules such as

E112H should be studied.

It was demonstrated in Ref. [9] on example of E112 and other SHEs that the errors in

calculations due to employing the point nuclear model (instead of the realistic Fermi nuclear

charge distribution) reach 0.4 eV for transition energies between low-lying states, whereas

neglecting the Breit eﬀects leads to the errors up to 0.1 eV. The generalized relativistic

eﬀective core potentials (GRECPs) [10] were generated for E112 and other SHEs [9] which

allow one to simulate Breit interaction and Fermi nuclear model by economic way but

with very high precision [11]. The accuracy of these GRECPs and of the RECPs of other

2

groups was estimated in atomic numerical SCF calculations with Coulomb two-electron

interaction and point nucleus as compared to the corresponding all-electron Dirac-Fock-

Breit calculations with the Fermi nuclear model.

It was justiﬁed and checked in [9, 11]

that the GRECP method allows one to carry out reliable calculations of SHEs and their
compounds within the level of “chemical accuracy” (1 kcal/mol, 0.043 eV, or 350 cm−1 for

valence energies) when the valence and outer core shells are appropriately treated. Hence,

the overall accuracy of calculations in heavy-atom molecules is limited, in practice, by current

possibilities of the correlation methods and codes and not by the GRECP approximation.

In this paper, we present GRECP calculations of the spectroscopic constants for the

ground states of the E112H molecule and its cation. To our knowledge, only two calculations

on E112H and E112H+ were published [12, 13].

In paper [12], the third order Douglas-

Kroll (DK3) method was applied to calculation of E112H and its ions. The correlations

were taken into account by the second-order M¨oller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2) and

by the coupled cluster method with single, double (and triple) cluster amplitudes, CCSD(T),

for 19 external electrons of the E112H molecule. It is not clear from [12] why the correlations

with the 6p shell of E112 are considered but those with the 6s and 5f ones are not whereas

the small value of calculated dissociation energy, DNH

e =0.06 eV, could be strongly inﬂuenced

by the latters. The 6s and 6p shells are closely localized in a space, whereas the 5f and

6p shells have close orbital energies. The eﬀect of the ﬁnite nuclear size was accounted

for but the Breit eﬀects and even the spin-orbit (SO) interaction were neglected (i.e., only

scalar-relativistic calculations were made). It is clear that both eﬀects are increased with the

nuclear charge Z, therefore, these approximations can be inappropriate for SHE compounds

even if they are justiﬁed for their lighter analogues.

In paper [13], the pseudopotential (PP) calculations of the E112H+ ion (but not the

neutral E112H molecule) were carried out by the MP2, complete active space SCF, mul-

tireference conﬁguration interaction (MRCI) and CCSD(T) methods [29]. The SO, ﬁnite

nuclear size and Breit eﬀects were taken into account at the PP generation stage. It should

be noted that the parameters of this PP were ﬁtted with the help of the adjustment pro-

cedure based on the LS-coupling scheme (which was, in general, inappropriate for SHEs

since the errors of these PPs were up to 4 eV for valence energies in our test calculations

accounting for the SO interaction non-perturbatively). Recently, a new PP for E112 is gen-

erated by Seth et al. using the jj-coupling scheme [30], but we are not informed about the

3

corresponding molecular calculations.

Methods and calculations. The GRECP [9, 10, 11, 14], Fock-space relativis-

tic CCSD (RCC-SD) [15, 16] and spin-orbit direct conﬁguration interaction (SODCI) [17, 18]

methods used for the present calculations have been well described in literature. The gaus-

sian expansions of our GRECP and (16, 21, 16, 12, 14)/[4, 6, 4, 2, 1] basis set for E112 (as well

as for other elements) are available at our website http://www.qchem.pnpi.spb.ru/Basis/.

In the SODCI calculation, the relativistic scheme of conﬁguration selection was applied [19].

Two series of Fock-space RCC-SD calculations were performed for E112H with the

GRECP. The ground state of the cation E112H+ served as reference in the ﬁrst series

(denoted by RCC-SD-1), and the Fock-space scheme was

E112H+ → E112H,

(1)

(2)

with an electron added in the lowest unoccupied σ orbital of E112H+. The second series
(RCC-SD-2) started from the ground state of the anion E112H− as reference, using the

Fock-space scheme

E112H− → E112H → E112H+,

with electrons removed from the highest occupied σ orbital of E112H−.

Our test atomic RCC calculations on E112 showed that at least 34 external electrons of the

atom (occupying the 5f, 6s, 6p, 6d, 7s, . . . shells) should be correlated and the basis set should

include up to k-type harmonics (l=7) in order to calculate the excitation and ionization

energies with “chemical accuracy”. Nevertheless, we expect that the contributions of the core

correlations will be less important for the molecule than for the atom as was in our similar

calculations [14, 20, 21] on Hg and HgH. This is, in particular, supported by a large orbital
energy separation between 5p and 5d shells in Hg (ε[5p3/2; 5d3/2] ≈ −2.8; −0.65 a.u.) and by
a comparable separation between 6p and 6d shells in E112 (ε[6p3/2; 6d3/2] ≈ −2.4; −0.56 a.u.)
Therefore, only 13 external electrons for the E112H molecule (12 electrons for E112H+) were

correlated in the present calculations. The calculations with the more number of correlated

electrons are rather time-consuming and planned in future.

In scalar-relativistic CC-SD calculations, we have also estimated (see Table I) that cor-

relations with the 6p shell of E112 give relatively small contributions to the spectroscopic

constants in E112H and E112H+ except for De in E112H+. This cation dissociates to
E112+(6d4
1/2) + H(1s1) unlike the HgH+ case. The 6p shell is closely localized

3/26d5

5/27s2

4

to the 6d shell, therefore, the correlations between these shells have to be important for

transitions with an essential change in the occupation number for the 6d shell. In principle,

the De value for E112H+ can be easily corrected using our atomic RCC results for ionization

potential of the 6d5/2 subshell of E112. However, we observed large compensations between

contributions accounting for correlations with core shells and for basis functions with high

angular momenta. Thus, the above ionization potential from calculation with 12 correlated

electrons in the basis including up to g-harmonics (l=4) diﬀers from that with 52 electrons
and l up to 8 only on +478 cm−1 (0.06 eV).

The calculations were carried out for 15 internuclear distances from 2.3 a.u. to 3.7 a.u. with

interval of 0.1 a.u. The spectroscopic constants were calculated by the Dunham method in

the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. All our RCC and SODCI results reported in Table I,

were improved using counterpoise corrections (CPCs) [22, 23] calculated for the E112 6d107s2

state with a ghost H atom. CPCs calculated for the ground state of the H atom are about
1 cm−1, and are, therefore, ignored.

Results and discussion. Our results for the ground states of E112H and E112H+ are

collected in Table I. The corresponding results [14, 21] for HgH and HgH+ and the results

of other groups [12, 13] for E112H and E112H+ are also presented for comparison. In the

GRECP/RCC-SD-1 calculations one can observe the bond length contraction for E112H
and E112H+ on 0.07 and 0.06 ˚A with respect to HgH and HgH+. Detailed comparison of

our results for HgH and HgH+ with the results of other groups and the experimental data

can be found in Ref. [21].

Our RCC-SD values for spectroscopic constants show considerable diﬀerences between the

two Fock-space schemes (GRECP/RCC-SD-1 and GRECP/RCC-SD-2). Such diﬀerences

are caused by the truncation of the CC operator, they indicate signiﬁcant contributions

of the omitted higher-order (triple, etc.) cluster amplitudes (HOCA). Their inﬂuence on

the total energies in each point of the potential curves were estimated with the help of the

conﬁguration interaction corrections on HOCA [24] calculated as diﬀerences in the total

energies of the SODCI and RCC-SD-1 values. In these calculations, the same numbers of

electrons were correlated as in the above RCC-SD case, but a reduced basis set, [4, 4, 3, 1] on

E112 and [3, 2] on H, was used because approaching the full conﬁguration interaction limit

in SODCI calculations becames too time-consuming in larger basis sets.

Except for the dissociation limit, HOCA has small eﬀect on E112H+ since the cation is

5

a closed shell system. It is well known that CC approach works particularly well for the

closed-shell systems which is conﬁrmed by the comparison of the GRECP/12e-RCC-SD-1

results with and without HOCA correction for E112H+. The change in De is mainly due to

diﬀerent ionization potentials for the 6d5/2 electron of the E112 atom in the RCC-SD-1 and

SODCI calculations. The GRECP/12e-RCC-SD-2 results show considerable dictinctions

from the HOCA corrected results because the E112H+ ion is calculated in the high Fock-

space sector, (2,0), in which some lost of accuracy takes place. The HOCA contribution for

E112H is important. Similar trend was observed in our GRECP/RCC calculations [21] on

HgH when the eﬀect of the triple cluster amplitudes was taken into account for 13 electrons

that essentially improved the agreement with the experimental data.

The diﬀerences between DK3/CCSD(T) [12] and our GRECP/RCC-SD-1 + HOCA re-

sults are small for E112H+, but are essentially larger for E112H. In particular, unlike our

GRECP/13e-RCC-SD-1 + HOCA bond length, the DK3/19e-CCSD(T) value [12] for E112H

is larger than the experimental data [25, 26, 27, 28] for HgH. It worth to note that the

DK3/CCSD(T) calculations [12] are scalar-relativistic whereas our RCC and SODCI calcu-

lations are performed with the spin-dependent GRECP. To check the eﬀect of SO interaction,

we have also carried out scalar-relativistic CC calculations with the spin-averaged GRECP

part. The same basis, number of correlated electrons, Fock-space schemes, etc. were taken

as in the RCC calculations. One can see from comparison of our corresponding CC-SD

and RCC-SD results that the SO eﬀects are small for E112H+ (except for De) but are very

essential for E112H.

The Re and we values for the E112H+ ion by the PP/CCSD(T) method from Ref. [13]
(see the footnote in Table I) diﬀer from the DK3/18e-CCSD(T) results [12] by -0.017 ˚A and
+45 cm−1. The corresponding PP/CCSD(T)+SO values diﬀer from our GRECP/12e-RCC-
SD-1 + HOCA results by -0.023 ˚A and +126 cm−1. One, however, can rather expect some

increase in Re for E112H+ and decrease for E112H when accounting for correlations with

the innermore shells.

Conclusions.

It is well known that properties of SHEs are somewhat diﬀerent from their

lighter analogues due to very strong relativistic eﬀects ﬁrst of all (see [16] and references).

Therefore, even those approximations which works well for the lighter analogues (neglecting

the SO interaction for Σ states, the eﬀective state of a considered atom in a molecule,

the preferred valency, etc.)

should not be used for SHEs without serious checking and

6

analyzing. The calculated equilibrium distance, Re, in E112H is notably smaller than that

in HgH. Therefore, one can also expect smaller bond lengths for the other E112 compounds

in comparison with the Hg ones. There is a long-term discussion in scientiﬁc community

whether E112 will behave like Hg or Rn. The ground state RnH and XeH molecules are not

observed in the gas phase. Our calculations for the E112H molecule do not predict large

dissociation energy, De, but it is yet close to that of HgH. Therefore, we suggest that the

ground state E112 compounds will rather resemble the Hg ones than will have the noble

gas behavior. However, calculations of other compounds, in particular, of dimer E1122 are

necessary to make a deﬁnitive conclusion about the valence properties of E112.

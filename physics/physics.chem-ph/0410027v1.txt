The low-energy spectra of the single-mode h⊗(G+H) linear Jahn-Teller model is studied by means
of exact diagonalization. Both eigenenergies and photoemission spectral intensities are computed.
These spectra are useful to understand the vibronic dynamics of icosahedral clusters with partly
ﬁlled orbital quintet molecular shells, for example C60 positive ions.

INTRODUCTION

In icosahedral molecules and ions, there occurs the pos-
sibility of a partial occupancy of a quintet of orbitally
degenerate electronic levels, of h symmetry. A notable
example is that of positive C60 ions, with one (or several)
holes in a hu molecular orbital [1, 2]. At the adiabatic
level, partly occupied quintet states are unstable against
molecular distortions involving the vibrational modes of
the molecule. Distortions along nondegenerate A modes
do not involve symmetry reduction, are therefore not of
Jahn-Teller (JT) type, and can be trivially treated as
phonon shifts: thus we will ignore A modes altogether.
Distortions involving fourfold-degenerate G and ﬁvefold-
degenerate H modes reduce the molecular symmetry, and
are responsible for the leading (linear) contribution to the
splitting of the ﬁvefold molecular level. Other (T1 and
T2) modes are involved in higher-order couplings, which
become dominating only for substantially large distor-
tions. Under speciﬁc circumstances (null or very strong
linear coupling) the inclusion of higher-order couplings
could become essential. However, the present work fol-
lows the standard practice of neglecting all higher-then-
linear coupling terms and treating the phonons as har-
monic oscillators [3, 4]. This approximation provides a
simpliﬁed model meant to capture the basic shape of
the ﬁve adiabatic potential energy surfaces (APES) in
a neighborhood of their high-symmetry conical intersec-
tion, hopefully extending out to include the JT minima.
The advantage of the idealized linear model is that it in-
volves a minimal number of parameters, and that it can
therefore be studied in detail, drawing fairly general con-
clusions, applicable to a wide enough range of realistic
systems.

Indeed, besides C60, orbital quintets could be relevant
for the spectroscopy of other icosahedral molecules and
clusters among those synthesized in recent years, includ-
ing smaller and higher fullerenes such as C20 and C80, B12
or B84 clusters, B12H12, the smallest icosahedral systems
Si13, Na13, or Mg13, and icosahedral structures with 13,

19, 55, and 147 atoms in xenon clusters. With diﬀerent
coupling patterns possibly realized in those diﬀerent sys-
tems, it is of clear interest to investigate how the vibronic
spectrum changes as a function of electron-vibration cou-
pling. For simplicity, here we restrict ourselves to a single
mode (of either G or H type) coupled to the orbital quin-
tet.

Several works [3, 4, 5] attach the JT problem of the
orbital quintet in the linear approximation and for a
single mode. These early works are mainly studies of
the APES, and in particular of its minima, with the
phonon coordinates treated as classical variables. Other
papers deal with the full quantum mechanical prob-
lem, and provide either approximate [6, 7, 8] or exact
[9, 10] solutions, sometimes for the many-modes case
[11, 12]. The quantum mechanical dynamics of the en-
tangled electron-phonon system is aﬀected by an elec-
tronic geometric phase, whose presence/absence has rel-
evant consequences, in particular, for the ground-state
(GS) symmetry [8, 9, 13, 14, 15, 16], thus for magnetic
resonance spectroscopies [17]. In particular, Ref. 10 pro-
vides a detailed study of the evolution of the tunneling
splitting through the range of coupling parameters for an
H mode[46].

Unfortunately, to date, no experimental determination
of the tunneling splitting in any icosahedral JT system
is available.
In contrast, spectroscopic techniques can
and do provide direct measurements of the JT vibronic
spectrum. For example, molecular photoemission [18, 19]
was recently shown [11] to provide relatively detailed in-
formation on the low-lying part of the vibronic spectrum
of C+
60, especially in a speciﬁc symmetry sector [20]. A
clean theoretical understanding of the general features of
this vibronic spectrum is therefore desirable.

The present work provides precisely an exact determi-
nation of the low-lying vibronic levels of the single-mode
linear model, those usually of most direct experimental
access. The spectrum is studied through a wide range
of coupling parameters, from weak to strong coupling.
In practice, the reported results are mainly relevant for
weak to intermediate coupling, since, as noted above, the
linear JT model is little more than a mathematical curios-
ity in the strong-coupling limit, where higher-than-linear
powers of the distortion become dominant. The vibronic

spectra presented in this work illustrate several interest-
ing quantum phenomena characteristic of dynamical JT.
Several numerical energies reported in Appendix A can
be used as benchmarks of the accuracy of future calcu-
lations based on approximate approaches, for example of
the type of Refs. 6, 21.

II. MODEL AND CALCULATION

The model [4, 6, 10] describing the JT coupling of the
orbitally degenerate h quintet with the molecular vibra-
tions of symmetry Λ = G, H is conveniently formulated
as follows [10, 22, 23]:

tional coordinates (in units of the natural length scale of
the harmonic oscillator), and ˆPµ the corresponding con-
jugate momenta. The multiplicity r = 1, 2, needed for
Λ = H vibrations only, labels the two separate kinds of
coupling allowed under the same symmetry [22, 24]:

Without any loss of generality, the energy position ǫ
of the h quintet will be taken as the zero of energy. In
this single-mode problem, all energies are naturally mea-
sured in units of the vibrational quantum ~ω. The sec-
~ω (the JT energy) is
ond characteristic energy scale g2
Λ
smaller/larger than ~ω for small/large gΛ (weak/strong
coupling). The weak-coupling regime is characterized by
rapid tunneling among shallow clustered potential wells
and strong non-adiabaticity associated to the vicinity to
the conical intersection of the ﬁve Born-Oppenheimer po-
tential sheets; the level structure is perturbatively related
to the harmonic spectrum of ˆHvib. As the coupling grows
to intermediate and strong, the JT wells deepen and
move away from the conical intersection and from each
other: tunneling decreases and the vibronic spectrum ac-
quires a characteristically intricate structure, which sim-
pliﬁes again in the strong-coupling limit, where tunneling

2

is exponentially suppressed and semiclassical considera-
tions apply [8].

The adiabatic approximation, where the vibrational ki-
netic energy is neglected, provides the main (static JT)
features of the strong-coupling limit. The distortion op-
erators ˆQµ are treated as classical coordinates, and op-
timal distortions are obtained by minimizing the lowest
APES [6, 7], for example by means of the ¨Opik-Pryce
method [25]. These optimal distortions (JT wells, or
minima) are associated to speciﬁc splitting patterns of
the electronic quintet. In particular, G modes produce a
3, 7, 7), in correspon-
8,
level pattern of the type (
dence to 10 JT wells of D3 residual symmetry.

The situation is slightly more intricate for an H mode
[4, 6, 10], due to the multiplicity r = 1, 2. The coupling
scheme, associated to the r = 2 Clebsch-Gordan coeﬃ-
cients, produces the splitting pattern (
1, 3, 3)
in correspondence to 10 D3 minima, like the G modes.
The r = 1 scheme produces a splitting pattern of the type
4, 1, 1, 1, 1), in correspondence to 6 JT minima of D5
(

symmetry.

In practice, the two-scheme coupling for the H modes
is a convenient theoretical idealization, since any H mode
of a real molecule is associated to some amount of cou-
pling of both r = 1 and r = 2 kind. This admixture is
conveniently characterized by introducing two coupling
constants for each H mode, rather than one. The two di-
mensionless linear coupling parameters g(1)
H can be
expressed in polar coordinates [10, 22] as

H , g(2)

g(1)
H = g cos α ,

g(2)
H = g sin α .

(5)

In summary, besides its frequency ω, each H vibrational
mode is characterized by a pair (g(1)
H ) of linear cou-
plings, or equivalently a global coupling intensity g plus
a mixing angle α.

Figure 1 shows the evolution of the quintet of elec-
tronic eigenvalues as α takes its possible values[47]. Here,
the molecular vibration operators are treated as classical
variables, and are taken at the relevant static JT mini-
mum, of D5 or D3 symmetry, appropriate for each value
of α. Pure coupling of type 1 is recovered at α = 0 and
π, while pure coupling of type 2 occurs for α = π/2. At
53.3◦
the special angles αs = arctan(3/√5)
and π
αs, where cusps occur in the α-dependence of
the eigenvalues, D5 and D3 minima are exactly degener-
ate: the JT minima collapse into a single ﬂat trough, and
the symmetry of the JT system is eﬀectively larger than
icosahedral [4, 9, 13, 26, 27, 28]. Figure 1 shows that for
a given coupling energy g2~ω, the lowering of the lowest
electronic state (equal twice the static JT energy gain) is
strongest at α = 0, π and weakest at αs, π

To compute the exact vibronic spectrum of ˆH, full
quantum-mechanical treatment must be applied also to
the vibrational operators. The standard ladder-operator
representation for the vibrational coordinates ˆQµ =

Figure 2a shows the diﬀerence between the exact dy-
namical JT GS energy and Eclas (the classical adiabatic
~ω of the 10 D3 wells plus the zero-point
energy
energy 2~ω of the uncoupled oscillators), as a function
of the coupling strength gG to a G mode. This residual
energy represents the part of JT energy gain not ascrib-
able to trivial adiabatic lowering of the JT minima with
respect to zero coupling: this energy diﬀerence gauges
quantum-mechanical eﬀects on the vibrational motion.
The rapid decrease in GS energy at weak coupling is due
to the large drop in quantum kinetic energy in the transi-
tion from harmonic oscillations around one isolated adi-
abatic minimum to rapid tunneling among 10 shallow
minima. As these minima move apart, tunneling is sup-
pressed, and the plotted energy diﬀerence turns back up
1)~ω, which mea-
to the strong-coupling value (3−1/2
sures the zero-point energy gain due to phonon softening
at the anisotropic JT minima [1, 31]. Indeed, the second-
order expansion of the lowest APES around any of the
equivalent JT minima yields two normal modes (of sym-
metry A1 and A2 in the local D3 group) both of frequency

−

etry, times the electronic quintet. It is straightforward
to write ˆH matrix elements in this basis and diagonalize
the resulting matrix. This basis centered on the high-
symmetry point is especially convenient at weak cou-
pling, where converged low-energy vibronic eigenenergies
and eigenstates are obtained by including only few basis
states. For large g, the number of basis states needed for
a given accuracy of the low-energy levels grows rather
quickly, approximately as g2nosc , where nosc = 4 for a
G mode and nosc = 5 for an H mode. For this reason,
and because of the extreme sparseness of this problem,
the Lanczos method of diagonalization [29, 30] is espe-
cially suitable here. We use a method very similar to
the one employed in Ref. 10, with the introduction of
several reﬁnements to deal with the problem of Lanczos
ghost states, and the symmetry analysis. We check all
results against basis truncation. For most results, inclu-
sion of n = 35 phonons in the basis is largely suﬃcient
for an accuracy of 10−6~ω, but for occasional points in
parameter space the basis needs to include up to n = 60
phonons (over 8 million states) to guarantee the required
accuracy. The spectra computed with this method and
reported below draw a full quantitative link from weak
through intermediate to strong coupling for the h
G
and h

H linear dynamical JT model.

provides an accurate estimate for the exact vibronic en-
ergy (Fig. 2a) at strong coupling, where inter-well tun-
neling is suppressed and the phonon dynamics reduces
to harmonic oscillations around the JT wells. Note that
the “new” frequencies at the wells are independent of the
coupling strength gG, since for diﬀerent coupling gG, the
set of ﬁve APES diﬀers only for a scaling factor, thus
remaining self-similar. At weak coupling, the harmonic
frequencies at the JT wells remain unchanged, but this
expansion is practically irrelevant, since quantum kinetic
energy delocalizes the motion far enough from the min-
ima for anharmonic and nonadiabatic eﬀects to domi-
nate.

The vibronic GS symmetry remains H at all couplings.
This is eventually a consequence of a Berry phase of π
acquired by the electronic wavefunction as the distor-
tions follow any of the cheapest (5-corner) loops through
adjacent D3 minima: this entanglement makes the to-
tally symmetric A vibronic combination of the wells less
advantageous than the H combination, which thus re-
mains the GS for all gG. Indeed, as seen in Fig. 2b, even
at strong coupling, the A vibronic state lies above both
the H GS and a G excitation At strong coupling, these
5(H) + 4(G) + 1(A) states represent the 10 symmetry-
adapted vibronic combinations of the harmonic GS’s at
the 10 D3 wells. Likewise, in the strong-coupling limit,
higher excited states, represent suitably symmetrized
combinations of vibrational excitations in the wells. In
particular, the 20 states (T1 + T2 + G + 2 H) converging
at strong coupling to 3−1/2~ω represent the tunneling-
symmetrized one-phonon oscillations of the new softer
frequency.
Similarly, the 20 states (A + T1 + T2 +
2 G + H) converging at strong coupling to ~ω represent
the tunneling-symmetrized one-phonon oscillations of the
modes at the original frequency ~ω.

At weak coupling, the vibronic levels reconstruct the
harmonic ladder, as expected when ˆHe−v is a weak per-
turbation. The present exact calculation traces precisely
the crossover from the weak to strong coupling regime:
for accurate numeric eigenvalues, see Table I in the Ap-
pendix. It is worth noting that the lowest A level, which
at strong coupling is a low-energy tunneling excitation,
correlates to the 2 ~ω multiplet at weak coupling [7]. Fi-
nally, note that the T1 and T2 levels are exactly degener-
ate for all values of the coupling.

Like for the G mode, the strong-coupling asymptotic
vibronic energies, are determined by the normal frequen-
cies of oscillation around the adiabatic JT minima, and
these frequencies now depend on α. The ﬁve normal
modes separate into a radial vibration of unchanged fre-
quency ω and symmetry A1, plus two softer doubly-
degenerate (of E1 and E2 symmetry for D5 wells and
both of E symmetry for D3 wells) tangential modes, rep-
resented in Fig. 3. For special α values, extra degenera-

We move on now to study the spectrum for a vibra-

pends now on two parameters. Each vibronic eigenvalue
traces a 2-dimensional surface as g and α (or equivalently

H ) are varied. The most eﬀective presentation
of these spectra is obtained by means of radial cuts at

Observe that the normal frequencies at the wells only
depend on α, while they are independent of the coupling
strength g, like for the G mode. Again, these single-
well harmonic frequencies determine the strong-coupling
asymptotic vibronic energies, but they are essentially

The spectrum of excitations Fig. 4b is much less clut-
tered than that of the G mode (Fig. 2b). The main
reason is the larger than icosahedral eﬀective symmetry
of the Hamiltonian at this speciﬁc coupling angle. This
larger (spherical) symmetry induces extra degeneracies
among the vibronic levels, which one could in fact label
with spherical angular-momentum labels. The lowest ex-
cited state is of A symmetry:
it is the one state which
at strong coupling drops towards the H GS. Together,
these 5(H) + 1(A) states represent the 6 symmetrized
tunneling-split vibronic combinations of the harmonic
GS’s at the 6 D5 wells. An approximate analytical ap-
proach to this problem based on this idea (the unitary
transformation method [32]) yields [7] an estimate of
the excitation energy (solid line in Fig. 4c)[48]: this ap-
proximation is seen to be fairly accurate throughout the
range of couplings. The approximate expression underes-
timates the tunneling splitting at strong coupling due to
the simplifying assumption of isotropic JT wells, of fre-
quencies all equaling ω, which therefore exaggerate the
localization of the distorted states. Corrections due to
the anisotropy of the wells were introduced in Ref. 21.
In the Appendix, Table II reports a few of the vibronic
eigenenergies used to draw Fig. 4.
excitations

cluster around the harmonic
normal-mode energies at the D5 wells: the tangential
~ωτ = (9/10)1/2~ω and the radial ~ω. The 24 states
(T1 + T2 + 2G + 2H) around ~ωτ are symmetrized com-
binations of the four 1-phonon states per each of the six
D5 JT wells. Likewise, the 6 states (H + A) near ~ω
are combinations of the 1-radial-phonon states in the 6
wells. Note in particular that the two 1-phonon H states
remain almost degenerate until g . 2, they split signif-
icantly in the interval 2 . g . 8, and then re-converge
again (to ~ωτ ) at strong coupling. At strong coupling,
higher excitations (not drawn) are found in the overtone
region 2 ~ωτ , and above.

Higher

For α = π/10, Fig. 5a shows the exact GS energy re-
ferred to Eclas. This small value of α has little eﬀect on
the GS energy, as compared to the α = 0 case. On the
contrary, the comparison of Fig. 5b with Fig. 4b shows
that even such a small value of α (i.e. a tiny admixture
of the coupling of type r = 2) is suﬃcient to completely
resolve the “accidental” degeneracies of the α = 0 spec-
trum. A and G states are little aﬀected, while the T1/T2
degeneracy is widely broken. Likewise, the weak-coupling
near degeneracy of the 1-phonon H states for α = 0 is
now widely split. Eventually, at strong coupling, these
two H states converge to diﬀerent tangential frequencies
of the JT wells.

Coming to the spectrum for α = π/5, Fig. 6 shows
a continuous evolution away from α = 0 through α =
π/10. We observe that, at strong coupling for both α =
π/10 and α = π/5, only one new frequency is seen in
the strong-coupling spectrum: that of decreasing ωτ for
increasing α (ωτ = 0.86 ω for α = π/10, ωτ = 0.69 ω
for α = π/5). Figure 3 conﬁrms that the frequency ωτ of
the other tangential mode is very close to its maximum ω,

Moving further away from this accidental degeneracy,
to α = 0.28 π (Fig. 7), the two new tangential frequen-
0.33 ω and ω(2)
cies become ω(1)
0.61 ω. These
frequencies are so small because of the nearness to the
special angle αs where D5 and D3 minima degenerate to
a ﬂat trough (see Fig. 3). These small values explain the
twofold reason why the spectrum of Fig. 7b is so clut-
tered: (i) tunneling is only weakly suppressed by the low
inter-well barriers, and (ii) several overtones and combi-
nations of these soft tangential modes ﬁt in the consid-
ered energy range. The large zero-point energy lowering
shown in Fig. 7a is also well accounted for by the values
of ωτ .

The next point α = 3π/10 (Fig. 8) is located imme-
diately beyond αs, with D3 minima barely prevailing
over D5 distortions. Here, the tangential frequencies are
as low as ω(1)
0.125 ω and ω(2)
0.247 ω: this ac-
counts for the huge zero-point energy lowering apparent
in Fig. 8a in the strong-coupling limit.
In contrast to
all previous α values, where D5 wells prevail, we observe
here the celebrated [6, 9, 10] level crossing (occurring
at a rather strong coupling g
12) to a nondegenerate
GS of A symmetry. The vibronic spectrum (Fig. 8b) is
now even more cluttered than for α = 0.28 π, it shows
an intricate pattern of level crossings (states of diﬀerent
symmetries) and avoided crossings (states of the same
symmetry). Several higher-lying levels have been omit-
ted in the plot for clarity. This is due to the exceedingly

Coming now to α = 2π/5 (Fig. 9), the tangential fre-
quencies at the D3 minima are now ω(1)
0.529 ω and
ω(2)
0.854 ω, much larger than for the previous cut
τ
at α = 3π/10. These values account for the reduced
zero-point energy lowering shown in Fig. 9a. Also, the
spectrum (Fig. 9b) is less dense: the 10 tunneling states
(A + H + G) converge to zero energy at strong coupling;
the 20 1-phonon tangential states converging to ~ω(1)
τ are
fairly well visible; the tangential ~ω(2)
, radial ~ω, and
τ
overtone 2 ~ω(1)
states are still substantially intermixed
even at the large coupling of the right side of Fig. 9b.
The splittings between T1 and T2 pairs are consistently
reduced here, compared to previous values of α. Note in
particular that, in contrast to the α range producing D5
wells, both 1-phonon H states correlate at strong cou-
pling to the lowest tangential mode of frequency ~ω(1)
τ .
A fairly general feature of the vibronic spectrum, espe-
cially visible in Figs. 2b, 9b, and 10b, is the rapid drop
of several vibronic energies, then followed by a successive
climb back at strong coupling where tunneling is sup-
pressed and the motion gradually collapses to oscillations
around the adiabatic wells.

due to suppressed tunneling splitting. The spectrum is
now even less dense than for previous values of α, due
to the larger frequencies at the JT wells, and the exact
degeneracy of the T1 and T2 pairs. The 20 1-phonon tan-
gential states (G + 2H + T1 + T2) converging to ~ω(1)
are
well visible; the 20 states (of the same symmetries) con-
verging to ~ω(2)

The α-dependence of the low-lying excitations (mea-

the 2-phonon overtone, as a function of α. This value of
g is suﬃciently small for perturbation theory to provide
not especially bad estimates of the excitation energies
drawn in Fig. 11. A, G, and H energies are symmetric
around α = π/2, while T1 and T2 energies are antisym-
metric functions of α, coming in pairs. The lowest A

it evolves into a low-energy tunneling partner with the
H state (and a G state when D3 minima prevail). The
average position of the two H states in the one-phonon
multiplet is located above ~ω: this causes the characteris-
tic signature of JT in molecular photoemission which was
observed and discussed in Ref. 11. Note that no singular
behavior is observed near αs and π
αs (vertical lines), in
contrast to all quantities based on a classical treatment
of the vibrations, such as those plotted in Figs. 1 and 3:
the transition from D5 to D3 wells is perfectly smooth in
the quantum spectrum, and signaled by only a number
of extra degeneracies.

Figure 12 reports the excitation energies of several low-
lying vibronic states for g = 11 (intermediate/strong cou-
pling). The tunneling partners are visible at the low-
energy end, with the crossing to an A GS in the range
0.42π . α . 0.58π. The coupling is not strong enough to
have the higher vibronic levels organized according to the
harmonic frequencies of Fig. 3 throughout the α range,
but similar trends are already recognizable: in particu-
lar for α . 0.2π and α & 0.8π, the vibronic levels follow
quite closely the harmonic frequencies of Fig. 3, and their
overtones and combinations. As observed in the discus-
sion of Fig. 8, the vibronic spectrum in the strong tunnel-
ing regions at and around the ﬂat-trough values α = αs
and π
αs is extremely congested: only the lowest-lying
states are drawn in ﬁgure. Accordingly, most vibronic
levels undergo a fast movement in that region, but al-

−

ways evolve continuously across α = αs and π
αs. In
the limit of inﬁnitely large g, the singular behavior of
Fig. 3 would eventually emerge even in the exact quan-
tum spectrum. The very large slope in the α dependence
of many vibronic energies may prove useful in future pre-
cise determinations of the JT coupling parameters from
spectroscopic data.

IV. PHOTOEMISSION SPECTRA

Several spectral properties of experimental interest are
readily accessed by the exact diagonalization method at
hand. Photoemission spectra (PES) involving the quintet
h molecular orbital are of course aﬀected by JT coupling
to the degenerate vibrations. If, as is usually the case, the
photoemitted electron kinetic energy is much larger than
~ω, photoemission occurs in a time much shorter than
that characteristic of phonon dynamics. In this limit, it
is convenient to apply the sudden approximation [33, 34],
where the photoemission process is described simply by
the operator ˆcmσ suddenly destroying a spin-σ electron
in orbital component m of the quintet level. The phonon
shakeup contributions to the PES are obtained in terms
of the matrix elements of this hole-creation operator ˆcmσ
between the initial conﬁguration and the ﬁnal vibronic
states. If we assume that the initial temperature is neg-
ligible (kBT
is initially popu-
lated), then the PES intensity for the creation of a spin-σ
hole in orbital m is

A. JT in the initial states

10 X
mσ

For generic occupancy of the h level, the spectrum
is generally aﬀected not only by JT, but also by intra-
shell electron-electron repulsion, and the ensuing multi-
plet structure [1, 23, 35]: calculation of the PES in such
conditions must take into account several other system-
speciﬁc interactions. It thus goes beyond the study of the
single-mode rather general model considered in this work.
However, electron-electron repulsion plays no role in two
relevant cases, which are therefore completely described
by the JT Hamiltonian ˆH of Eqs. (1)-(4): (i) when a
single electron occupies the quintet orbital in the initial
state, and (ii) when the orbital quintet is initially com-
pletely full and photoemission produces a single hole in
the ﬁnal state. In the ﬁrst case, JT only aﬀects the initial
conﬁguration, while in the second case, JT only aﬀects
the ﬁnal states. The application of exact diagonaliza-
tion to the two cases separately provides spectra where

When JT only aﬀects the initial states, the molecule is
instantaneously brought from the multi-well intrinsically
nonadiabatic vibronic GS to a linear superposition of the
ﬁnal harmonic oscillator states. According to Eqs. (7)
and (8), the peaks in the spectrum are located at the
ﬁnal-state energies Ef , which here simply involve sin-
gle or multiple excitations of the harmonic phonon ~ω.
The spectrum is therefore a sequence of regularly spaced
peaks, with intensity of the 0, 1, 2... -phonon line propor-
tional to the square modulus of the corresponding total
component in the initial vibronic GS.

Figure 13 presents precisely a spectrum with this sim-
ple structure,
for an H mode characterized by α =
π/5. According to the standard electron-phonon (non-
JT) Frank-Condon picture, the percentage of spectral
intensity displaced away from the 0-phonon to the multi-
phonon excitations increases with the distance between

the initial and ﬁnal equilibrium conﬁgurations, which, in
turn, is proportional to the linear coupling parameter g.
The situation is qualitatively similar for α = 2π/5 (and
for the case of a G mode, which is omitted for brevity).
The only quantitative diﬀerence to observe in Fig. 14
compared to Fig. 13 is that for α = 2π/5 spectral weight
is preferentially transfered to the 1-phonon line, while
for α = π/5 it is more equally distributed among several
phonon excitations.

The spectra in Figs. 13-14 are obtained by means
of a complete Lanczos calculation of the GS wavefunc-
tion. This is straightforward, as long as zero temper-
ature is addressed as in the present work.
If instead
ﬁnite-temperature was to be considered, many initial
vibronic states would be required for a thermal aver-
age, and this is generally a diﬃcult task for the Lanczos
method [37]: completely diﬀerent techniques, e.g. based
on Monte Carlo, could prove more convenient there.

B. JT in the ﬁnal states

When JT aﬀects the ﬁnal states, the energies Ef mark-
ing the PES peaks are the vibronic energies of Figs. 2, 4-
12. The transparent structure of a harmonic spectrum is
now lost. However, the calculation of the PES is straight-
forward, as
is now the 0-phonon state of the ﬁlled-
shell non-JT molecule [49]. The symmetry of the state

Figure 15 reports the computed PES for a coupled G
mode and a few intermediate values of g. The positions
of the low-lying peaks correspond to the solid lines of
Fig. 2b, and are readily followed. Strong intensity trans-
fers due to level crossings are well visible. The intensity of
the “zero-phonon” line (better referred to as the vibronic
GS) decreases steadily as g increases [50]: the intensity
lost there redistributes across an intricate vibronic spec-
trum.

Figures 16 and 17 report the computed PES for a cou-
pled H mode characterized by the same value of α of
Fig. 6 (π/5, producing D5 minima) and of Fig. 9 (2π/5,
producing D3 minima) respectively. The positions and
intensities of several low-lying peaks can be traced: sev-
eral intensity transfers due to level crossings are well vis-
ible. Again, the intensity of the “zero-phonon” line de-
creases consistently as g is increased, while the intensity
lost there redistributes across a rather dense spectrum of

V. DISCUSSION

vibronic levels.

Figures 15-17 illustrate in detail the general ﬁnding
[11] that in the PES of dynamic JT system with weak to
intermediate coupling, the “1-phonon line” splits into es-
sentially two features, usually with most spectral weight
in the upper peak, blue-shifted up to 30% higher energy
than ~ω. The blue shift of the 1-phonon satellite is not
(G + H) JT model. For example, sim-
speciﬁc to the h
ilar conclusions apply to the e
E problem [38]. Indeed
a 15% blue shift of the ﬁrst vibronic satellite is clearly
observable in the PE spectra of benzene [39].

⊗

⊗

A general feature of the displayed PES is that the per-
turbative structure of n-phonon states, still fairly well
recognizable for g = 2), is rapidly lost in the PES for
g & 3. The only other general consideration we can draw
from these spectra is that not much regularity is to be
expected: unless coupling is very weak, phonon shake-
ups in the PES from a JT molecule build very intricate
spectral structures, which are strongly g-dependent (also
α-dependent, for H modes), even for a single phonon
mode.

Understanding the general features of a vibronic spec-
trum is a necessary step towards the interpretation and
assignment of the spectra of molecules and molecular
ions. This has been undertaken and carried out quite
extensively for electronic doublets, triplets [38, 40, 41]
and more complex electronic conﬁgurations [35, 42, 43].
The present paper ﬁlls a gap in the theory of icosahe-
dral systems, providing general guidelines for the inter-
pretation of vibronic PES of the electronic quintet in the
(G + H), restricting to the idealization of a single
h
⊗
mode.
In practical applications, the situation is much
more intricate. All actual icosahedral systems are many-
mode systems, where the inter-mode interaction gener-
ates a much less coherent spectrum than simple non-JT
phonons [44]. The present theory allows the basic un-
derstanding of the PES of icosahedral systems wherever
the coupling to a single high-energy mode is dominant,
the other couplings only contributing to the background.
The couplings of fullerene C60 are approximately of this
kind, and the spectral of Sect. IV B allow to rational-
ize some observed PES features in terms of an eﬀective
single-mode theory.

On the other hand, the spectra of Sect. IV A describe a
situation where a single electron in a h state is rapidly re-
moved. This cannot occur in practically accessible ionic
states of C60, but could well occur in singly charged neg-

ative ions of higher icosahedral fullerenes, under the con-
dition that the LUMO is a quintet. By particle-hole sym-
metry, the same theory applies to inverse PES, where a
single hole in a quintet is ﬁlled. This is relevant, e.g. for
inverse PES of C+
60.

The diﬃculty of the many-modes JT [12, 38] is that
no linear superposition of the spectra of single modes oc-
curs (except for the weak-coupling limit). This means
that any quantitative description of the dynamics re-
quires to include all modes together in a single calcula-
tion. The method of Lanczos exact diagonalization used
in the present work is by no means limited to the single-
mode case. Indeed, Ref. 11 deals successfully with the in-
tricacies of the C60 many-mode problem, also accounting
for thermal eﬀects. The same theory used in Sect. IV B
for PES could be applied to an optical transition from
a nondegenerate electronic a state to a ﬁnal h state, if
that dipole-forbidden transition could be realized. Modi-
ﬁcations of the same method could be employed to study
phonon shakeups in optical absorption/emission in dipole
allowed transitions involving electronic degenerate states
at both sides: these are often associated to “product”
JT systems [35, 45], and with due account of “term” ex-
change interactions, JT would account for the vibronic
“decorations” of the spectra, not unlike PES. More ap-
plications of the Lanczos method (including generaliza-

tions thereof [30]) to other spectroscopical applications
are therefore expected in the future.

Tables I-IV collect a number of exact vibronic eigenen-

Note that Eclas was not subtracted here, therefore the
tabulated energies represent precisely the eigenvalues of
the Hamiltonian as deﬁned in Eq. (1). All reported dig-
its are signiﬁcant. Extra degeneracies are apparent in all
tables except Table III (α = π/4). However, the appar-
ent degeneracy between the A states and H states for
g = 15, α = 0 (Table II) only indicates that the (tun-
neling) splitting between these states is smaller than the
energy resolution of the diagonalization (see also Fig. 4).

sentation of ˆH yields automatically the matrix elements
hf |ˆcmσ|0i, without any need to store any Lanczos vec-
tor and reconstruct any of the actual eigenstates of the

respect to the ﬁnite length of the Lanczos chain.

[50] The zero-phonon line intensity is the same in the initial
and ﬁnal JT conﬁgurations (e.g. in Figs. 13 and 16), since
the involved matrix elements are the same.

Theory of adsorption on a surface with nanolocal defects is proposed. Two eﬃcacy parameters
of surface modiﬁcation for nanotechnological purposes are introduced, where the modiﬁcation is a
creation of nanolocal artiﬁcial defects. The ﬁrst parameter corresponds to applications where it
is necessary to increase the concentration of certain particles on the modiﬁed surface. And the
second one corresponds to the pattern transfer with the help of particle self-organization on the
modiﬁed surface. The analytical expressions for both parameters are derived with the help of the
thermodynamic and the kinetic approaches for two cases: jump diﬀusion and free motion of adsorbed
particles over the surface. The possibility of selective adsorption of molecules is shown with the help
of simulation of the adsorption of acetylene and benzene molecules in the pits on the graphite surface.
The process of particle adsorption from the surface into the pit is theoretically studied by molecular
dynamic technique. Some possible nanotechnological applications of adsorption on the surface with
artiﬁcial defects are considered: fabrication of sensors for trace molecule detection, separation of
isomers, and pattern transfer.

I. INTRODUCTION.

The progress in the development of nanotechnology gives rise to the possibility to modify the surface at the
nanometer scale. Various methods of nanometer-scale defects creation using scanning tunneling microscope (STM)
and atomic force microscope (AFM) were elaborated.
In particular, nanometer-scale defects can be produced by
electric ﬁeld between the STM needle tip and the surface [1] – [3], with the help of nanolocal chemical reactions
induced by the STM needle tip [4] – [6], and by direct touching of the STM [7,8] or AFM [9] tip. Nanometer-scale
defects may inﬂuence on adsorption of particles (atoms, molecules and clusters) [10]. Surface nanostructures have been
fabricated with the help of adsorption on the surface modiﬁed by scanning probe anodization [11]. We believe that
the further advance in nanotechnology can be achieved when techniques of nanostructures fabrication with the help
of adsorption will combine with preliminary nanolocal surface modiﬁcation. Therefore the theoretical investigations
of the nanolocal processes during adsorption on heterogeneous surface is an actual task at present time.

Here we present the theory of adsorption on the surface with nanolocal defects, with sizes of the order of the size
of only one adsorption site (see also [12,13]). Two eﬃcacy parameters of surface modiﬁcation by creation of artiﬁcial
defects are introduced. The ﬁrst eﬃcacy parameter γ can be useful for such applications where it is important to
increase the total concentration of particles on the surface. For example, such applications may be fabrication of
sensors for trace molecule detection and separation of isomers. The second eﬃcacy parameter Γ can be useful for
applications where high ﬁlling of adsorption sites on defects νd ≈ 1 is necessary simultaneously with the absence
of adsorbed particles on the surface free of defects. One of such applications, for example, may be pattern transfer
through the use of particle self-organization on the modiﬁed surface. Two limiting cases of adsorption are considered:
the case of low temperature when adsorbed particles are localized and the case of high temperature when adsorbed
particles freely move over the surface. Analytical expressions for parameters γ and Γ are derived for both cases of
localized and freely moving particles using equilibrium thermodynamics and the kinetics principles.

The energy of molecular adsorption in pits with various sizes and shapes is investigated. It is shown that this energy
is determined by the size of the pit. Therefore molecular adsorption on defects may be selective to a type of molecule.
The process of particle adsorption from the surface into the pit is simulated on using molecular dynamic technique
on the example of argon atom and graphite surface. The probability of adsorption from the surface into the pit is
calculated with the help of this simulation. The calculated value of this probability is used to estimate both eﬃcacy
parameters γ and Γ of surface modiﬁcation for the case of argon atom absorbed on graphite surface with a pit.

Some possibilities for nanotechnological applications of adsorption on the surface with artiﬁcial defects are discussed
in detail: fabrication of sensors for trace molecule detection, separation of isomers, and pattern transfer as a result of
particle self-organization on the modiﬁed surface.

II. THEORY OF ADSORPTION ON A SURFACE WITH DEFECTS.

Let us consider the system containing the particles of one type in three states:

in a gas, in adsorbed states on
defects (adsorption site D) and on areas of the surface which are free of defects (adsorption site S). We restrict our
consideration to the case of nanolocal defects with only one adsorption site. The process of an adsorption of a particle
on a surface can be considered as a chemical reaction

Molecule A + free adsorption site on the surface =
= adsorption complex A

The condition for equilibrium of this ”chemical reaction” is

where µg, µa and µ′
a are chemical potentials of the particle in the gas, of the adsorbent per one adsorption site and of
the adsorption complex, respectively. We shall restrict our theoretical consideration to the case of physical adsorption.
In this case the following approximation can be used [14]

where µs is the chemical potential of the particle adsorbed on site S. We use the analogous approximation for particle
adsorbed on the defect. Taking into consideration this approximations, the condition for thermodynamic equilibrium
of the system is

where µd is the chemical potential of the particle adsorbed on the defect. This case is analogous to adsorption of N1
immobile particles adsorbed on N2 adsorption sites. Therefore the chemical potential of the particle adsorbed on the
defect is (see, for example, [14])

surface, and interaction with the surface. The chemical potential of the particle in the ideal gas is

where qintg is the partition function of the particle in the gas, qintg includes internal degrees of freedom and rotations,

For some nanotechnological applications it is necessary to increase the concentration of certain particles adsorbed
on a surface. Some of these applications, namely, fabrication of sensors for trace molecule detection and separation of
isomers will be discussed below. We believe that following modiﬁcation of surface may be useful for such applications:
On the surface the nanolocal artiﬁcial defects are produced so that adsorption of certain particles on defects (sites D)
causes signiﬁcant increase in the concentration of these particles in comparison with concentration of these particles on
a perfect surface (where only sites S are present). Such modiﬁcation is worthwhile only in the case of low concentration
of this particles on perfect surface, i.e. when ﬁlling ν0 of sites S is small (ν0 ≪ 1). By this is meant that the contribution
of particles adsorbed on sites S into the total concentration of particles adsorbed on a modiﬁed surface is negligible.

Total concentration nt on modiﬁed surface is approximately equal to concentration n1 of particles adsorbed on sites D.
Let us introduce the surface modiﬁcation eﬃcacy parameter γ equal to the ratio between concentrations on modiﬁed
surface nt and perfect surface n2

where n0 is the concentration of sites S on the perfect surface. It is worthwhile to modify the surface if γ ≫ 1. Let
us obtain the expression for the surface modiﬁcation eﬃcacy parameter γ for diﬀerent cases. The magnitude of this
parameter is deﬁned by the equation µd = µs and therefore it does not explicitly depend on the gas pressure.

Let us consider the case of low temperature kT ≪ ∆E, ∆E being the height of the potential barrier between two
adjacent adsorption sites S. In this case particles adsorbed on sites S jump between these sites. The expression for
the chemical potential of the particle adsorbed on sites S has the same form as for the particle adsorbed on the defect.
In result the equation µd = µs leads to the relation

where q0 is the partition function of the particle adsorbed on site S. Now we substitute in Eq. (9) the equalities
νd = n1/nd and ν0 = n2/n0 and consider the case ν0 ≪ 1, when the surface modiﬁcation is worthwhile for the
purpose of selective adsorption. In result we get

From Eq. (10) we obtain

The partition functions of the particles adsorbed on sites D and S respectively may be represented by the expressions

[14]:

d and q′

where q′
0 are the partition functions of the adsorbed particles including internal degrees of freedom, vibrations,
and rotations or frustrated rotations; Ed and E0 are adsorption energies of particles adsorbed on sites D and S
correspondingly. We get

Now we consider the case of high temperature kT ≪ ∆E when particles adsorbed on sites S freely move over the
surface. In the case of low concentration of particles adsorbed on perfect surface (ν0 ≪ 1) the interaction between
adsorbed particles can be disregarded. Therefore we consider the system of particles adsorbed on perfect surface as
the two-dimensional ideal gas. Then the chemical potential of the particle adsorbed on sites S is given by

Note that in both cases, when adsorbed particles are localized and freely move over the perfect surface, the depen-

dence of the parameter γ on the concentrations n2 and nd has the analogous form (Eqs. (14) and (17)).

To estimate the value of parameter γ with the help of Eqs. (14) and (17) it is necessary to calculate the partition
functions of the particles. Nevertheless equivalent results can be obtained using kinetics principles. Contrary to our
derivation of expression for parameter γ with the help of thermodynamical approach, where we use approximation
(9) valid only for physical adsorption, the consideration of kinetics below is valid for both physical and chemical
adsorption. By analogy with the standard premises of the Langmuir and BTE adsorption theories [17], we suppose
that the kinetic coeﬃcients for the adsorption and desorption of the particles are independent of their concentration.
We suppose also that each site D on a modiﬁed surface is surrounded by area with sites S where local concentration
of particles on this area equal to their concentration on perfect surface n2. According to detailed balance for particles
exchange between D and S sites we have

d is a coeﬃcient of the adsorption on site D of the particle which have been just adsorbed on site S, and k+

where k
d is
a coeﬃcient of desorption from site D with subsequent adsorption on site S. From Eq. (19) we obtain the expression
for parameter γ

The coeﬃcient k+

d is given by the Arrhenius formula [15]:

where Ωd is a frequency multiplier equal in order of magnitude to the vibration frequency of the particle adsorbed
on the defect, and ∆Ed = Ed − E0 + ∆E1 is the activation energy for the desorption of the particle from the defect
onto the surface free of them, Ed and E0 being the adsorption energy of the particle adsorbed on sites D and S,
correspondingly, and ∆E1 is the height of the potential barrier between adsorption sites on the defect and on the
surface.

Where kT ≫ ∆E, the particle freely move over the surface, and the coeﬃcient of adsorption on a defect site D

from an area of surface with sites S is

R < v >s n2 exp(−∆E1/kT ),

where k′ is the probability of the adsorption on the defect site D for the particle moving over the surface just after its
collision with site D, R is the radius of the defect, and < v > the average velocity component parallel to the surface
for the particles adsorbed thereon. We deﬁne the probability k′ as the ratio k′ = Na/Nc between number Na of events
of adsorption on site D immediately after the collision and number Nc of these collisions. This quantity is analogous
to the coeﬃcient of attachment of the particles to the surface in the case of an adsorption from a gas on a surface.

Expressions (14), (17), (23), (25) can be extended to the case of some diﬀerent kinds of defects. Disregarding the

we get

where γi is the surface modiﬁcation eﬃcacy parameter for the i-th kind of defects.

For some nanotechnological applications a high ﬁlling νd ≈ 1 of sites D and absence of adsorbed particles on sites
S are necessary. For example, let us consider a pattern drown by the particles adsorbed on sites D. To distinguish
such pattern two conditions should be fulﬁlled. Firstly, a high ﬁlling νd ≈ 1 of sites D corresponds to a large value of
parameter α1 = 1/1 − νd. Secondly, for better pattern contrast the ﬁlling νd of sites D should be signiﬁcantly greater
than the ﬁlling ν0 of sites S, that corresponds to a large value of parameter α2 = νd/ν0. Let us introduce the second
surface modiﬁcation eﬃcacy parameter Γ which is equal to product of parameters α1 and α2

The analytical expressions for parameter Γ are derived with the help of both thermodynamical and kinetic ap-
proaches. Under the thermodynamical consideration we use the equation µd = µs analogous to the derivation of
expressions for parameter γ. In the case of jump diﬀusion of particles adsorbed on sites S we get

The Eqs. (29) and (30) are not convenient for practical use (analogous to Eqs. (14) and (17)) because it is necessary
to calculate the partition functions. Therefore we have derived the equivalent expressions with the help of kinetic
consideration. In the case of jump diﬀusion of particles adsorbed on sites S we get

In the case when particles adsorbed on sites S freely move over the surface we obtain the following expression

Note, that nanotechnological procedures described by parameters γ and Γ are applied only to the case of low
concentration of adsorbed particles on sites S (ν0 ≪ 1). Therefore the neglect of interparticle interaction is adequate
for our consideration. However, Eqs. (23), (25), (31) and (32) derived in the framework of the kinetic approach may
be easily extended to the case where this interaction is important (analogous to homogeneous adsorption, see, for
example, [18]). To take into account an interparticle interaction it is suﬃcient to replace Ed by Ed + wdNd and E0 by
E0 + w0N0, where wd and w0 are interaction energies between neighbor particles, and Nd and N0 are average numbers
of nearest neighbors for particles adsorbed on sites D and S, respectively.

III. ADSORPTION ENERGY OF MOLECULES IN THE PITS.

The adsorption of particles on an unperfect surface for the simplest cases had been studied previously:

in the
cylindrical pore [19], in the split-shaped pore [20], at the intersection of two perpendicular steps forming a reentrant
corner [20]. Nevertheless these studies dealt only with rather large surface defects. The case of nanolocal defects with
sizes of order of the size of only one adsorption site was not considered.

Theory presented above does not depend on the nature of defects. They may be structural defects or chemical one
and so on. We consider molecule adsorption on a single type of structural defects, namely, pits made by removing
tens of atoms from the surface. Our interest in this type of defects is attracted by following reasons. Firstly, according
to expressions (14), (17), (23), (25) surface modiﬁcation eﬃcacy parameter γ ∼ exp((Ep − E0)/kT ). Therefore the
modiﬁcation of surface by presence of the pits with certain size can cause the increase of concentration of certain kind
of molecules. Some nanotechnological applications based on this eﬀect are discussed in Sec. 4 (fabrication of sensors
for trace molecule detection, separation of isomers etc.). Secondly, because of the recent nanotechnological advances
the various techniques to produce pits on the surface had been elaborated. For example, it is possible to fabricate
the pits only several nanometers in diameter [2,3] and even to remove a single atom from the surface structure [3]
with the help of ﬁeld desorption by STM tip. Therefore a theoretical study of particle adsorption in a pit is an actual
problem now.

Here we have calculated the adsorption energy Ep for the argon atom and benzene and acetylene molecules adsorbed
on graphite surface in pits that are diﬀerent in size but can accommodate only one particle. We have choose a graphite
for our study because the adsorption of argon (see, for example, [21]) and various molecules (see, for example, [22]–
[24]) on perfect graphite surface have been carefully theoretically studied in a set of papers. Besides, the pits on the
graphite surface were produced by nanolocal chemical reactions near STM tip [5] and by bombardment of cations
with subsequent etching [25].

This is a nonspeciﬁc adsorption case where the adsorbate-adsorbent interaction is of the Van der Waals type [17].
We have described the interaction between the argon atom and the carbon atoms in terms of the Lennard-Jones
potential

U = 4ε

(σ/r)12 − (σ/r)6

(33)

with a cutoﬀ radius of rc = 3.2, where the potential parameters have been taken to be σ = 3.12 ˚A and ε = 54.4 K
[21], σ = 3.82˚A and ε = 31.6 K for the C-C interaction [26], and σ = 3.37 ˚A and ε = 21.7 K for the H-C interaction
[26]. The atoms of graphite have been assumed to be ﬁxed at the lattice sites, three graphite layers with 288 atoms
in each layer being taken into account. The interatomic bonds in the molecules have been taken to be rigid, and the
interatomic bond angles ﬁxed. The bond length values used (1.4 ˚A for the C-C bond and 1.08 ˚A for the H-C one)
have been borrowed from [26].

(cid:2)

(cid:3)

We have considered pits with near circular shape that are created by the removal of atoms located inside circles of
radii R1 and R2 for ﬁrst and second graphite layers correspondingly. The centers or these circles locate on one vertical
line l. All possible pits with 0 ≤ R2 < R1 < 5.06˚A for argon atom and with 0 ≤ R2 < R1 < 6.80˚A for acetylene
and benzene molecules have been investigated. Several diﬀerent positions of line l relative atoms of graphite were
considered. Namely, the line l passes through: 1) an atom of upper graphite layer under which an atom of the second
layer locates (type A); 2) an atom of upper graphite layer under which an atom of the second layer is absent (type B);
3) the center of a bond between two atoms of upper graphite layer (type C); 4) the center of hexagon formed by atoms
of upper graphite layer (type D). The optimal pits with one and two graphite layer deep, where the adsorption energy
is a maximum Emax
are found for all three adsorbates. For all these cases the energies of adsorption in optimal
pits are maximum when the center of a particle coincide with the center of the pit. Several pits of oblong shape
with the size close to the size of the optimal pit with near circular shape are also examined for acetylene molecule.
Nevertheless the adsorption energies in these oblong pits are less than adsorption energy in the optimal pit with near
circular shape. These adsorption energies Emax
and characteristics of optimal pits are listed in Table 1 for all three
adsorbates.

The calculations show that the adsorption energy in an optimal pit for small particles (argon atom and acetylene
molecule) is nearly twice as large as the adsorption energy on perfect surface. The adsorption energy in the optimal
pit with two graphite layer deep is only 7 % greater than the adsorption energy in the optimal pit with two graphite
layer deep. The further increase of pit depth does not cause the adsorption energy to increase. Therefore a pit a mere
1-2 atomic layers deep may be suﬃcient to increase the absorption energy to the utmost, which is fairly convenient
for nanotechnological applications.

A particle adsorbed in a pit interacts with walls and bottom of the pit. And a particle adsorbed in a capillary
interacts only with walls of capillary. Therefore the adsorption energy of a particle in a pit is greater than in a
capillary with the same radius. Previously the adsorption energy of a particle in a cylindrical capillaries with various

6

c

c

radii has been calculated analytically [19]. In [19] the interaction between the particle and the walls of the capillary
has also been described in terms of the Lennard-Jones potential. However, the capillary walls in this simpliﬁed model
have been considered continuous. According to calculations in the framework of this model the ratio ǫ0 between the
maximal adsorption energy Emax
of a particle in the capillary and the adsorption energy on the perfect surface is
ǫ0 = Emax
/Es ≃ 3. This value of ǫ0 is 1.5 times as great as value calculated by us for adsorption in a pit ǫ0 = 2.06.
Therefore the consideration of the location of all the atoms of surface is necessary for exact calculation of adsorption
energy in a pit or a pore. For benzene molecule adsorbed in an optimal pit, the simpliﬁed model [19] overestimates the
maximal increase in the adsorption energy even more because atoms of adsorbed molecule interact weaker with pit
wall sections distant from them than with the pit bottom. The value of the energy ratio ǫ0 calculated here for argon
atom adsorption in a pit on graphite surface is close to the one calculated for argon atom adsorption on microporous
magnesium oxide with taking into account location of all the atoms [20]. According to the calculation [20] Emax
/Es
p
≃ 1.8 for the split-shaped pore and at the intersection of two perpendicular steps forming a reentrant corner.

Fig. 1 demonstrates that the energy of adsorption in a pit is determined by the size of the pit. This ﬁgure also
shows that a pit too small to accommodate a molecule even reduces its adsorption energy. This two facts open up
new interesting possibilities for nanotechnological applications which have been discussed below. An additional point
to emphasize is that the ”ﬂat” benzene molecule placed in a pit of optimal size but with a ”unﬂat” bottom has a
lower adsorption energy than in the case of unmodiﬁed surface.

IV. SIMULATION OF ADSORPTION OF PARTICLE IN PITS.

The parameters γ and Γ have been estimated for the case of argon atom adsorption on graphite surface with
pits. For this estimation it is necessary to calculate the oscillation frequency Ωp of atom adsorbed in a pit and the
probability k′ of the absorption in the pit for the particle moving over the surface just after its collision with the pit.
These quantities were obtained by molecular dynamics simulations. According to Eqs. (23) and (32) parameters γ
and Γ increase with the adsorption energies Ep in a pit. Therefore two pits were used for simulation: the optimal
pit with maximum adsorption energy in it and the pit with maximum adsorption energy among the investigated pits
with only one graphite layer depth (see Table 1). The adsorption energy in this pit is only 8% less than adsorption
energy in optimal pit.

A system consisting of three graphite layers with 288 atoms in each layer was used in simulation. Along X and Y
axes parallel to the graphite surface we impose periodic boundary conditions on the system. The size of the simulation
cell in these directions was 27.08×23.43˚A. The interaction between the argon atom and carbon atoms was represented
by Lennard-Jones potential (33). The atoms of second and third graphite layers were ﬁxed at equilibrium positions.
The interaction between carbon atoms of ﬁrst graphite layer was described by modiﬁed Born potential

where rij are distances between carbon atoms, r0ij are distances between carbon atoms at equilibrium positions, α
and β are force constants. We take α = 505.1 N/m and β = 84.4 N/m [27]. The Born potential represents the
expansion of the interaction energy between carbon atoms in terms of ∆rij = rij − r0ij . Therefore this potential is
adequate only for small values of ∆rij . We simulated the system at temperatures that approximately 20 times less
than the temperature of graphite melting. At such temperatures the displacements of graphite atoms from equilibrium
positions and, consequently, values of ∆rij are small. Therefore we consider that Born potential is acceptable for our
simulation.

The equations of motion were integrated using the leap frog algorithm. The integration step used was τ = 2. · 10−15
s. Initially the system of graphite atoms has been brought to the equilibrium during 5·103 steps (about 300 oscillations
of atoms in graphite) in canonical ensemble and 5 · 103 steps in microcanonical ensemble. Further simulations were
performed in microcanonical ensemble. The total energy of the system with the temperature 185 K was conserved to
within 1 % and average ﬂuctuations of temperature were within 3 %.

The estimation of oscillation frequencies Ωd of atom adsorbed in the pits has been performed for the system with
the temperature 165 K. Initially we took the system without a pit with equilibrium coordinates and velocities of
carbon atoms. Then the pit arises near the center of simulation cell and an atom was placed in the pit at the position
that corresponds to the maximum adsorption energy. The new system with the pit and the atom adsorbed in this pit
has been brought to the equilibrium during 2 · 103 steps. Then frequencies Ωd were calculated during 6 · 103 steps. The
obtained values averaged over 40 modeling experiments are Ωd1 = 5.3 · 1011 s−1 and Ωd = 4.7 · 1011 s−1 for optimal
pits with one layer and two layers deep.

The size of simulation cell used is not suﬃcient for argon atom appeared in any place of the cell to come to
equilibrium with the surface before a collision with the pit. To overcome this diﬃculty the simulation of the process
of the atom adsorption from the surface into the pit was carried out using the following procedure. An argon atom is
placed in the center of simulation cell without a pit at the position that corresponds to the minimum of interaction
energy with the surface. Then this system comes to equilibrium until the argon atom reaches the boundary of the
cell. At the instant the argon atom crosses the boundary the pit arises in the center of the cell. The appearance of
the pit was investigated for the system at the temperature 185 K. The change in the energy of interaction between
argon atom and graphite atoms caused by the appearance of the pit is within 0.03%. Therefore we consider that the
appearance of the pit does not essentially perturb the motion of argon atom and equilibrium between argon atom and
surface. During the time between the appearance of the pit and the argon atom collision with the pit graphite atoms
make about 100 oscillations that is suﬃcient for system to come to equilibrium [28].

On the average an argon atom makes 12 jumps before collision with the pit. Average change in the kinetic energy
of argon atom in result of collision with the surface is < ∆E >= 17 ± 1.2%, ∆Ei = 2|Ei − Ei−1| · 100%/(Ei + Ei−1),
where Ei−1 and Ei are average through the time of jump kinetic energies of argon atom between i-1-th and i-th,
and i-th and i+1-th between collisions with graphite surface respectively. The value < ∆E > has been obtained by
averaging over 20 argon atoms, each making 10 jumps along the surface. We believe that observed energy exchange
between argon atom and the surface is suﬃcient to argon atom to come to equilibrium with the surface.

An argon atom was considered to collide with the pit when the distance between it and the center of the pit was
less than the distance between the center of the pit and a adjacent adsorption site S. An argon atom was considered
to be adsorbed in the pit when it makes two oscillations in the pit. The simulation with one atom was performed
until the atom reﬂects from the pit, adsorbs into the pit or evaporates from the surface. To exclude atoms with low
velocities the time of experiment was limited to 2 · 104 integration steps. The results of simulations are averaged over
all modelling experiments for given temperature of surface. These results and calculation of the probability k′ of the
adsorption into the pit and the eﬃcacy parameters are presented in Table 2. The probability k′ of the adsorption
into the pit slightly increases with temperature. We oﬀer the following explanation for this increase. When a particle
occurs on the surface near a pit edge it interacts with a less number of atoms of the surface than a particle located
on perfect surface. Thus the pit is surrounded by an energetical barrier. The magnitude of this barrier is found to be
about 300 K in simulated system. Therefore the fraction of particles capable to overcome the barrier increases with
the increase of temperature for the considered temperature range 120-280 K.

According to our estimations for considered case of argon atom and optimal pit in a graphite surface at temperature

200 K we get βn0 ≪ 1 for ν0 ≪ 1. Then Eq. (23) is simpliﬁed

γ = βnd

(35)

so that the parameter γ does not depend on the concentration of atoms in the gas. The Eq. (35) have been used
to estimate the parameter γ for considered case. Let us express the concentration of pits in terms of fraction of the
surface occupied by them, i.e., nd = α/πR2. The parameter γ is calculated for α = 0.1. The calculated parameters γ
and Γ are presented in Table 2. The magnitudes of these parameters are suﬃcient for nanotechnological applications
discussed below. We believe that this conclusion may be also obtained for various other pairs adsorbent-adsorbate.

Graphite is a very homogeneous adsorbent, i.e., the potential barriers ∆E between the adjacent adsorption sites
on it are low. For the argon atom, ∆E/k ≈ 32 K [29]. At low temperatures (kT < ∆E) the submonolayer (ν0 ≪ 1)
adsorption of argon on a graphite surface is impossible for any experimentally obtainable concentrations of atoms in
the gas. Therefore the case of jump diﬀusion of adsorbed particles is not considered for this pair adsorbent-adsorbate.

V. NANOTECHNOLOGY APPLICATIONS.

Here we describe some possible nanotechnology applications for the adsorption on a surface with nanometer-scale
artiﬁcial defects (see also [30]): pattern transfer as a result of self-organization of particles deposited on such surface,
and using of selective adsorption for sensors fabrication and isomer separation.

Pattern transfer. he elaboration of methods of pattern transfer in nanometer scale, i.e.

fabrication of nanos-
tructures on the surface according to a given scheme is very important for some nanotechnology applications (for
example, superdense recording of information, fabrication of periodic arrays of quantum dots and quantum wires,
one-electron devices etc.). In principle, surface nanostructures had been produced with the help of STM or AFM tip
by the transfer of single atoms [31,32], clusters [33,34], and nanoparticles [35]. Nevertheless, until now these methods
have the productivity insuﬃcient for nanotechnology purposes.

The other set of methods for surface nanostructures fabrication is based on self-organization of deposited particles:
a) the formation of islands in the result of nucleation in two-dimensional ﬁlm (see, for example, [10]); b)self-organizing

8

ordering in epitaxial layer with facets formation (see, for example, [36]); c) the formation of periodical surface structure
by laser radiation [37,38]. The method a) allows to control only average distance between islands. The methods b)
and c) are suitable only for periodical nanostructures fabrication with periods by chemical composition of nanoobjects
and wave length of laser radiation, correspondingly. The productivity of these methods is considerably greater than
transfer of single particles by STM or AFM tip. Nevertheless they are not suitable for pattern transfer.

A particle adsorbed on defect may play the role of nucleation center for island formation from the particles deposited
on the surface. For example, the gold islands on the graphite surface irradiated with ions form only around defects
[10]. We propose to deposit particles on the surface with defects located with the help of STM or AFM according to
given scheme. In this case the formed islands would merge into planned surface nanostructure.

Recently the diode on one molecule was fabricated [39]. We proposed to place such molecules in electronic schemes
of nanometer scale with the help of adsorption on specially created defects. We believe that by these means it is
possible to control not only the position but also the orientation of the molecule.

Sensors for molecular detection. Methods for detecting traces of certain molecules in a gas where their
concentration is low are of great importance in modern technology and ﬁnd application, for example, to ensure safety
in chemical industries and monitor environmental pollution. The further development of such methods, particularly
is therefore a high-priority task. A weak spot in methods used is the collection of molecules from air. The known
method of improving sensitivity [40] involves the nonselective accumulation of the trace molecules of interest on a
cooled substrate and their subsequent pulsed laser desorption. It therefore seems extremely tempting to develop a
method for selective adsorption of molecules on a cold surface.

Calculations performed show that the adsorption energy in a pit is determined by the size of the pit. We propose
to modify the surface of sensor by presence of the pits with maximum adsorption energy for certain kind of molecules.
According to the theory presented the concentrations of these molecules on the surface of sensor will increase. Therefore
it would enable one to add one more selective step to the existing two detection steps — the optical and the mass-
spectrometric ones.

Isomer separation. Pits can be arranged on a surface so closely that the distances between them have the same
order as their size. The molecular adsorption energy on such a surface will be higher for molecules that ﬁt in the
pits, compared to that on the unmodiﬁed surface, and lower for those which fail to ﬁt in the pits. A surface modiﬁed
in this fashion could be used to eﬀect the selective adsorption of a particular molecular species from a mixture of
diﬀerent molecules. What is more, a surface can be modiﬁed to have pits capable of accommodating only one of
several isomeric molecular species. We suggest using such a modiﬁed surface to detect or separate molecules diﬀering
in shape only (e.g., to isolate linear or cyclic isomers from their mixture and separate fullerene isomers and left- and
right-handed molecules).

In summary, the theory of adsorption on the surface with nanolocal defects is developed. Two eﬃcacy parameters
of surface modiﬁcation by creation of artiﬁcial defects are introduced for diﬀerent nanotechnological applications.
The estimations with the help of molecular dynamics simulations on the example of argon atom adsorption in the
pit on the graphite surface show that magnitudes of these parameters are suﬃcient for possible nanotechnological
applications.

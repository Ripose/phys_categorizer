Experiments on the diﬀusion-limited corrosion of porous copper clusters in thin gap cells contain-
ing cupric chloride are reported. By carefully comparing corrosion front velocities and concentra-
tion proﬁles obtained by phase-shift interferometry with theoretical predictions, it is demonstrated
that this process is well-described by a one-dimensional mean-ﬁeld model for the generic reaction
A + B (static)
C (inert) with only diﬀusing reactant (cupric chloride) and one static reactant
(copper) reacting to produce an inert product (cuprous chloride). The interpretation of the exper-
iments is aided by a mathematical analysis of the model equations which allows the reaction-order
and the transference number of the diﬀusing species to be inferred. Physical arguments are given
to explain the surprising relevance of the one-dimensional mean-ﬁeld model in spite of the complex
(fractal) structure of the copper clusters.

I. INTRODUCTION

Diﬀusion-limited processes are ubiquitous in physics [1], chemistry [2] and biology [3]. Reaction-diﬀusion processes
have been the subject of intense and continuous interest since the work of Smoluchowski [4–6]. A crucial feature
of many such processes controlling pattern formation and reaction eﬃciency is the “reaction front”, a dynamic but
localized region where reactions are most actively occurring which separates regions rich in the individual reactants.
The simplest theoretical model of a reaction front, introduced more than a decade ago by G´alﬁ and R´acz [7], is the
“mean-ﬁeld” model for two initially separated species A and B reacting to produce an inert species C. Since then, the
case of two diﬀusing reactants A and B has been thoroughly studied analytically [7–10] and numerically [11–21], and
some predictions of the mean-ﬁeld model have been checked in experiments [21–30].

In contrast, the case of only one diﬀusing reactant A and one static reactant B (conﬁned on a ﬁxed matrix) has
not yet been studied experimentally. We show in this paper that the corrosion of a porous solid (B) immersed in a
chemically active ﬂuid suspension (A) can also be described by such a mean-ﬁeld model. Some analytical [10,31] and
numerical [11,32] studies exist for this case as well, but since it is more microscopically complex (for a real porous
interface) than the case of two diﬀusing reactants (in a homogeneous medium) an experimental test of the model is
needed.

The mean-ﬁeld model of a planar reaction front for the chemical reaction

postulates that the concentrations ρA(X, T ) and ρB(X, T ) of species A and B, respectively, evolve according to a pair
of coupled partial diﬀerential equations [10,31],

initial conditions assume that the reactants are uniformly distributed and completely separated at ﬁrst, ρA(X, 0) =

AH(X) and ρo
X), where H(X) is the Heaviside unit step function. Such initial conditions are
easier to reproduce in experiments than those involving uniformly mixed reactants. There are several assumptions
behind Eqs. (2)–(3): (i) The product C is generated in small enough quantities that its presence does not signiﬁcantly
aﬀect the dynamics; (ii) The concentrations are dilute enough that the diﬀusivities are constant; (iii) The ﬁxed matrix
containing reactant B (static) is porous enough that reactant A can freely diﬀuse through it; and (iv) The reaction rate
is a function of only the local concentrations and not any ﬂuctuations or many-body eﬀects (which is the “mean-ﬁeld
approximation”). It is common to make the mean-ﬁeld approximation under the assumption R(ρA, ρB) = kρm

but in the interpretation of our experiments we will not assume anything about the form of R(ρA, ρB) a priori since
the reaction takes place at a solid-liquid interface. Moreover, this interface is highly ramiﬁed, and therefore, the
underlying microscopic dynamics is expected to be more complex than for simple homogeneous kinetics.

In this paper we carefully test the validity of these assumptions with experiments on a particular porous-solid
corrosion system: copper clusters corroded by a cupric chloride (CuCl2) electrolyte. The clusters are obtained by
a thin-gap cell electrodeposition from a CuCl2 electrolyte at ﬁxed current. This process builds a depletion layer of
CuCl2 ahead of the copper deposit. When the current is switched oﬀ, this CuCl2 depletion layer relaxes toward the
copper cluster bringing Cu2+ cations which react with copper according to:

CuCl2 (aq) + Cu (solid, red)

2 CuCl (solid, white)

(4)

→

where the cuprous chloride (CuCl) is produced in the form of small (white) crystallites which drop down to the bottom
of the cell.

In section II we describe the experimental set-up and the method used to prepare the porous clusters to be corroded.
In section III we report the experimental evidence that our corrosion system behaves like a 1D diﬀusion-reaction process
with one static reactant. In section IV, a mathematical analysis is presented which makes quantitative predictions
based on the experimental data of section II, within the theoretical framework of the mean-ﬁeld model, Eqs. (2)–(3).
In the last section IV, the experimental results are revisited to reﬁne the comparison with the theoretical model and
to discuss in some detail of its physical limitations.

II. EXPERIMENTAL METHODS

A. Apparatus

×

δ = 50µm between two closely spaced, optically ﬂat glass plates (λ/4 over 80mm

The experiments are performed in a thin-gap electrodeposition cell, which is depicted schematically in Fig. 1. The
L =
cell consists of an unsupported, aqueous solution of CuCl2 conﬁned to a narrow region of dimensions W = 5cm
8cm
50mm). Two parallel,
ultrapure copper and silver wires (50µm diameter, Goodfellow 99% purity) are inserted between the two glass plates
to act both as spacers and as electrodes. During the electrodeposition (prior to corrosion) the wires are polarized so
that the silver wire acts as the cathode and the copper wire as the anode. The solutions of CuCl2 (ACS reagent)
are prepared from deionized water, carefully cleaned of any trace of dissolved oxygen by bubbling nitrogen through
it for one hour. The anodic part of the cell (not shown in Fig. 1) is ﬁlled by a dilute solution of CuCl2 to postpone
the precipitation of the salt due to saturation eﬀects by dissolution of the anode. The copper electrodeposits are all
grown at constant current, and the entire experiment is performed at room temperature (

×

×

20◦C).

Digitized color pictures of the copper clusters are obtained by direct imaging of the cluster through a lens, using a
three-CDD camera coupled with an 8-bit frame grabber from Data Translation driven by the public domain software
IMAGE [33] which successively captures three RGB frames and from them reconstructs the color image.

≈

A phase-shift Mach Zehnder interferometer is used independently to resolve the concentration ﬁeld, averaged over
the depth of the cell. A sketch of the interferometer can be found in ref. [34]. The interference patterns are recorded
through a CCD camera coupled to the same frame grabber [33] with a 768
512 pixel resolution. Phase-shift interferom-
etry oﬀers several signiﬁcant advantages over traditional interferometry in that it provides an accurate reconstruction
of the entire concentration ﬁeld, using a set of successive interference pictures recorded for shifted values of the phase
diﬀerence between two optical wavefronts, and can also be used as an holographic interferometer [35].

B. Preparation of Copper Clusters by Electrodeposition

When current ﬂows from the anode to the cathode, charge transfer occurs at the cathode, leading to the reduction

of copper cations into copper metal according to [34,36,37]:

The actual mechanism of deposition is much more complex than this two electron transfer process since competitive
reactions involving the solvent species are likely to occur. Nevertheless, in CuCl2 electrolytes, we have observed
that the formation of cuprous oxide (Cu2O) in competition with copper by reduction of Cu2+ cations is not favored,
contrary to what is observed in copper sulphate (CuSO4) solutions [38–40], which can be partly explained by the
strong adsorption and complexation properties of chloride anions [37]. This reduction process on the cathode implies a

Cu2+ + 2e−

local depletion of the copper cations close to the cathode and, therefore, also their replenishment by a global transport
process, namely diﬀusion. Although electromigration also contributes to transport, it does not act independently of
100˚A
diﬀusion in regions where electroneutrality is maintained [41], which means everywhere in the cell outside the 10
thick double layer [42,43]. This often misunderstood fact was given a ﬁrm theoretical basis by Newman over 30 years
ago in his asymptotic analysis of the transport equations for a rotating disk electrode [44], but only recently has it been
quantitatively veriﬁed in experiments (by our group) for the case of constant boundary ﬂux at a ﬁxed cathode [34,36].
In summary, the theoretical and experimental evidences indicate that in the absence of convection the concentration
ρA of a dilute, binary electrolyte evolves according to the classical diﬀusion equation,

−

∂t

2ρA,

= DA∇
where DA is the “ambipolar diﬀusion coeﬃcient” for the electrolyte given by a certain weighted average of the diﬀusion
constants of the individual ions [41].

(5)

When the interfacial concentration of metal cation Cu2+ approaches zero, the interface becomes unstable and
develops into a forest of ﬁne spikes which compete between each other to invade the cell [45,46]. In some cases, a
“dense-branched” pattern is selected [36,47–50]. This morphology is characterized by a dense array of branches of
invariant width advancing at constant velocity v through the cell, whose tips delimit a nearly planar front between
the copper salt electrolyte and the deposit zone. We have shown recently that this growth regime can be modeled via
a 1D diﬀusion model through the measurement of the copper salt concentration ﬁeld ahead of the growing deposit by
interferometry [36,50]. The experimental concentration ﬁeld closely ﬁts the “traveling-wave” solution to Eq. (5),

where Ld = DA/v, and X is the distance to the front edge of the copper deposit, in the direction normal to the front,
oriented toward the bulk electrolyte. The diﬀusion length Ld is proportional to ρo
A is the initial bulk
concentration in copper cations and j is the current density. This diﬀusion length tends to zero as j/ρo
A increases, and

in that limit the concentration proﬁle looks like a step function. Note that ρA(X

deposition process, a linear relation exists between the velocity v of the growth and the interfacial ﬂux of cations J,
namely vρB = J, where ρB is the mean concentration of (metallic) copper in the region of the deposit.

where t+ is the transference number [41,43] of the copper cation in a CuCl2 electrolyte. Practically, t+ is a charac-
teristic of the electrolyte and therefore q will not be a free parameter in our experiments (neither t+ nor q depend
on the current density j). The closer t+ is to 1, the greater the concentration of copper inside the cluster. In CuCl2
electrolytes, t+ is expected to be smaller than 0.5, which implies that the copper composition of the deposited zone
will not go beyond twice the original concentration of CuCl2 in the electrolyte. Therefore, the copper clusters obtained
by thin gap electrodeposition in CuCl2 are in fact highly porous.

The large porosity of the deposited copper clusters is of fundamental importance in our subsequent study of the
corrosion of the copper deposits once the current has been switched oﬀ (and the electrodeposition halted) because, as
a consequence, the cupric ions are able to diﬀuse freely through the dendrites with approximately their bulk diﬀusivity
and then react with a large exposed surface of metallic copper. The low density of the deposit also suggests that
the product of the corrosion reaction, cuprous chloride (CuCl) crystal, is produced in small enough quantities that
its presence should not signiﬁcantly aﬀect the dynamics of the reaction-diﬀusion process. Therefore, by interrupting
the current during electrodeposition we can observe a simple reaction-diﬀusion system with two initially separated
reactants, copper chloride (A) and metallic copper (B), only one of which is free to diﬀuse. Since the initial interface
between the bulk electrolyte and the ramiﬁed electrodeposit is planar and the deposit is disordered, it is likely that
the dynamics of the corrosion process will be eﬀectively “one-dimensional” (1D), in the sense that there might be
nearly perfect translational symmetry in the two spatial directions (Y and Z) perpendicular to direction of the front
propagation. Moreover, since the dynamics occurs in three dimensions (as opposed to two for a surface or one for
a molecular channel), it is also likely that a mean-ﬁeld, continuum model will be valid, although this may not seem
obvious a priori in light of the complex geometry of the electrodeposits, which is known to be fractal

[51–53].

→

The rest of the paper is devoted to a careful, experimental validation of these hypotheses, showing that our
system is indeed accurately described by a one-dimensional, mean-ﬁeld model for the generic chemical reaction,
C. We begin in the next section by describing the scaling behavior of the reaction front and accompa-
A+B(static)
nying depletion layer of CuCl2. In the following section, a mathematical analysis of the one-dimensional, mean-ﬁeld
model is presented which incorporates the observed scalings and makes quantitative predictions regarding the reaction
front speed and the concentration evolution. Finally, these predictions are checked with a more detailed analysis of
the experimental data in the last section, and arguments are given to explain the relevance of the one-dimensional,
mean-ﬁeld model for our experimental system.

III. PRELIMINARY EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

A. Temporal Evolution of the Corrosion Front

At the moment when the current is switched oﬀ, the region of the copper deposit is entirely depleted of cupric ions,
which are thus initially separated from the metallic copper in the deposit. At later times, cupric ions diﬀuse amidst
the copper dendrites and react at the metal surfaces, leaving behind cuprous chloride (CuCl) crystallites. In Fig. 2 (a)
and (b) are shown images of a copper deposit just prior to corrosion and after 30 minutes of corrosion, respectively.
Note that in Fig. 2 (b) the interfacial region between the red copper (the grey color in this picture) and the white
CuCl is rather ﬂat and thin.

Focusing on the temporal evolution of this red/white interface, we have observed that, while at ﬁrst the white layer
of CuCl appears at the tips of the copper-deposit branches, it gradually becomes ﬂatter and ﬂatter. As a result, the
system approaches translational invariance along the Y direction, normal to the growth direction X, thus justifying
a one-dimensional model for the system involving the single spatial coordinate X (normal to the reaction front).

By carefully comparing the concentration ﬁeld of cupric ions obtained by phase-shift interferometry and the
red/white, Cu/CuCl interface observed on the deposit, the location and extent of the reaction front, where there
is a signiﬁcant overlap of metallic copper and cupric ions, can be identiﬁed. Following a transient regime (which we
T α with α = 0,
describe in the last section), it is observed that the reaction front approaches a constant width w
which is consistent with certain mean-ﬁeld models [10,11,31]. Using the theoretical methods pioneered by G´alﬁ and
R´acz [7] in the case of two diﬀusing reactants, this scaling was ﬁrst predicted by Jiang and Ebner [11] using physical
arguments supported by computer simulations and later by Koza [31] using asymptotic analysis.

which holds for any real number m

the experimental observation α = 0 is consistent with the usual one-dimensional, mean-ﬁeld theory only in the case
m = 1. If higher-order reactions were present m > 1, the theory would predict that the reaction front width increases
in time (α > 0) although always more slowly than diﬀusion (α < 1

The position of the reaction front Xf (T ) during the corrosion of a copper deposit (grown from a 0.5M CuCl2
solution at j = 40 mA/cm2) is plotted in Fig 3. Note that, after initial transients have vanished (T > 500 s), the
reaction front itself “diﬀuses” with its position given by the scaling, Xf ∼
2 , which is is also consistent
with predictions of the one-dimensional mean-ﬁeld model [7,11,31]. In fact, this diﬀusive movement of the reaction
front after long times is a robust feature of all mean-ﬁeld models for two initially separated species, regardless of the
reaction orders m, n
1 or the number of diﬀusing reactants (one or two), as long as there is no relative advection
of the two species (due to ﬂuid ﬂow or some other external forcing) [10] or impermeable membrane to one of the
reactants [54].

B. Temporal Evolution of the Diﬀusion Layer

At T = 0 when the current is interrupted, the reactants Cu and CuCl2 are completely separated, since the concen-
tration of CuCl2 is negligibly small in the immediate vicinity of the metallic Cu electrodeposit. During the subsequent
corrosion process the concentration of CuCl2 remains very small in the reaction front, which leads to the modiﬁcation

4

of the initial depletion layer of CuCl2 (produced by the electrodeposition process) into a region where the concentra-
tion smoothly interpolates to the value of the bulk solution far behind the front. The term “diﬀusion layer” is used to
describe this region because it is characterized by the transport of fresh CuCl2 by diﬀusion from the bulk, relatively
unaﬀected by chemical reactions due to the negligible (or vanishing) concentration of metallic Cu remaining behind
the reaction front.

The temporal evolution of the diﬀusion layer is revealed by precise interferometric measurements of the concentration
proﬁle of CuCl2. In Fig. 4 are shown three contour plots of the concentration ﬁeld computed from the integrated
index along the depth of the cell. Since the experiments are performed in thin-gap cells (50µm) and the depletion
layer spreads over distances larger than this gap, it is safely assumed that the concentration of CuCl2 does not change
appreciably along the Z direction (parallel to the laser beam [36]). If Fig. 4, the shadow of the Cu/CuCl cluster is
also clearly seen. A close inspection of the panels (b) and (c), which correspond to eroded clusters, reveals that in the
zone of the copper cluster where CuCl2 has diﬀused (recognizable where the leftmost isoconcentration contours have
moved through the cluster), the cluster has been broken down in smaller crystallites, which, as indicated by their
color in Fig. 2, are made of CuCl.

Typical experimental concentration proﬁles of CuCl2 measured at diﬀerent times (averaged along the Y direction,
normal to the growth direction) are shown in Fig. 5. The shape of these concentration proﬁles is discussed in the
next two sections, but here we focus on the scaling of the width Wd(T ) of the diﬀusion layer (deﬁned as the region
of non-negligible gradients). Fig. 6 shows that at long times (T > 500 s), the diﬀusion layer approaches a self-similar
δ,
structure, with the diﬀusive ﬂux entering the reaction front obeying the scaling law, Jd ∝
and that, therefore, the width of the diﬀusion layer has the familiar scaling [7,9,11,31] Wd ∼
2 , which is
another robust feature of the mean-ﬁeld models [10].

These initial conditions are closest to the actual ones used in the experiments when the copper deposit is grown at
large current, which corresponds to small Ld in Eq. (6). The initial-boundary-value problem of Eqs. (10)–(14) involves
an idealized, inﬁnite system possessing no natural length or time scale, and, therefore, it is expected that asymptotic
similarity solutions exist in which distance and time appear coupled by power-law scalings [55]. The experimental
system, on the other hand, possesses several relevant length scales, but they turn out not to aﬀect the evolution of
the reaction front, at least for some range of times. For example, the spatial scales of the copper deposit, such as the
typical dendrite spacing and dendrite width, surely aﬀect the dynamics at early times since these length scales are of
the same order as the diﬀusion length Ld [36], but it is observed that during corrosion the system quickly approaches
planar symmetry, averaged across scales much larger than individual dendrites. Likewise the length scale of the gap
spacing is not expected to greatly inﬂuence the corrosion dynamics because vertical (buoyancy-driven) convection,
which has been observed during the growth phase [56] is suppressed in 50 µm depth cells [34,57]. However, the
settling of the reaction product, CuCl crystallites, could have some eﬀect on the front dynamics at this scale. Finally,
the largest length scales, namely the distances from the outer edge of the deposit to the two electrodes, also should
not aﬀect corrosion dynamics until the reaction front gets close to the cathode and/or the diﬀusion layer approaches
the anode. Therefore, during intermediate times, after three-dimensional transient eﬀects have subsided but before
the system size begins to matter, the corrosion dynamics should be well described by a self-similar solution to the
one-dimensional mean-ﬁeld equations.

B. The Diﬀusion Layer

Motivated by these arguments and the experimental data, we consider the transformation

a(x, t) = ˜A(ζ, t),

b(x, t) = ˜B(ζ, t), where ζ =

which has been called the “quasistationary approximation” in the physics literature [9,15,31,58]. This is not really an
“approximation” but rather is an exact asymptotic property of a certain class of self-similar solutions to Eqs. (10)–(13)
which happen to accurately ﬁt the experimental data, as we will show in the next section. At this point it is common
to assume that the reaction term also vanishes relative to the diﬀusion term,

C. The Reaction Front

We now explore the consequences of the experimental results α = 0 and δ = σ = 1

2 within the present mathematical
model. Although the physical arguments made above for the lack of a natural length scale are much more tenuous in
the reaction front because the observed front width (about 0.2 mm) is comparable to the average dendrite thickness
(0.1 mm) and spacing (0.4 mm) as well as the gap (0.05 mm), the nearly perfect planar symmetry of corrosion process
leads us to nevertheless seek another asymptotic similarity solution to the one-dimensional, mean-ﬁeld equations in
the vicinity of the reaction front, x

transference number of the cation, through q = 1

reactant m = 1, i.e. f (b) = b or r(a, b) = ab, but it is impossible to reach this conclusion deﬁnitively from our data.
As shown in Figs 9 and 10, all of the measured concentration proﬁles collapse to the single asymptotic curve
predicted for q = 0.79 over the whole length scales investigated in the experiment. This quantitative agreement
between the experimental and theoretical concentration proﬁles of the diﬀusing reactant independent of the length
scale strongly support our modeling of this corrosion experiment with a one-dimensional A + B (static)
C (inert)
mean-ﬁeld model.

→

B. The transient

→

The A + B

C mean-ﬁeld model with two diﬀusing reactants exhibits many surprising and nontrivial behaviors
at short times (see [30] and references therein, [26], [61]). In this case, some microscopic parameters like the reaction
constant(s) can be determined from these short time behaviors. In particular, at a time inversely proportional to the
microscopic reaction constant, the global reaction rate switches from an initial t1/2 increase to a subsequent t−
1/2
decrease [30]. Moreover, in the reversible A + B ⇋ C system, a crossover between irreversible and reversible regimes
can be observed at long times [61] and the value of the backward reaction constant can be inferred from the crossover
time [26].

In the present case of one static reactant, it is also possible to express the transient decay to the asymptotic solution
in terms of the reaction orders m and n for the one-dimensional mean-ﬁeld model [10]. In our experiment, however,
the transient behavior is determined by a superposition of diﬀerent mechanisms since our system is not really one-
dimensional or homogeneous. We now show that the transient behavior appears to be governed by two-dimensional
geometric eﬀects that hide the kinetic features by analyzing the detail the experimental runs.

Looking at Fig. 4(a), note that the concentration ﬁeld is not one-dimensional at the early stages of the corrosion
experiment: the isoconcentration lines closely follow the jagged outline of the deposit in the region near the tips.
The amplitude G of the modulation of the leftmost isoconcentration line (the closest to the copper cluster) is about
0.4 mm. This system clearly cannot be viewed as one-dimensional until the front has traveled at least a distance on
the order of G. In Fig. 3, note that the time of the transient regime (before the asymptotic t1/2 behavior sets in)
0.4mm. (This two-dimensional
closely corresponds to the time needed for the front to move across a distance G
geometric eﬀect also may explain why the initial movement of the front is slower than the asymptotic behavior, as
shown in Fig. 3.)

∼

To further support this hypothesis, we now study the relaxation dynamics of the concentration ﬁeld. In Fig. 11-
(a), is plotted the isoconcentration line corresponding to a = ρa/ρo
a = 0.1, just after the current has been switched
oﬀ. This line is not continuous, because the concentration ﬁeld cannot be extracted by interferometry in the zones
containing the deposit. This line deﬁnes a function X(Y ) roughly periodic, of amplitude G(T ) and period λ
1mm.
It is reasonable to expect that the characteristic time for the relaxation of this modulation of the concentration ﬁeld
toward a ﬂat two dimensional proﬁle is the time τf needed for the front of copper to move from its starting position
(Xf (T = 0)) on the length scale G(T = 0) = 0.3 mm= 2ν
250s.
Moreover, in light of the analysis of Krug [62] described below, it is also reasonable to expect that the functional form
p
of the decay will be exponential.

Dτf , which yields the estimate τf = G(0)2/4ν2D

∼

∼

In Fig 11-(b), we plot log(G(T )/G(0)) as a function of the dimensionless time T /τf . The relaxation is well ﬁtted
by an exponential function, with a characteristic time close to τf , which supports our hypothesis. Therefore in our
experiments, the transient behavior is directly linked to the relaxation of the initial two dimensional concentration
ﬁeld towards a Y-invariant proﬁle and cannot provide information on the kinetics independently.

C. Physical relevance of the one-dimensional mean-ﬁeld model

In the previous sections, we have demonstrated the quantitative agreement between the behavior of our thin-gap
corrosion system and various predictions of a one-dimensional mean ﬁeld model. This agreement is not obvious a
priori, and therefore we close in this section by giving physical arguments to explain this surprising fact.

1. No inhibition of diﬀusion or reaction by CuCl

In Fig. 4 we see that the product of the reaction does not seem to disturb the concentration ﬁeld of the diﬀusing
reactant A. To understand this fact, we consider the volume occupied by the product CuCl in the cell. We know

11

1. Since the density and molecular weight of CuCl are 3.38 g.cm−

(4)
from Eq. (7) that the mean concentration of copper before the dissolution is
that if CuCl does not diﬀuse (which is veriﬁed in our experiments), the mean concentration of CuCl is twice the
initial concentration of copper, which is approximately four times the initial concentration of CuCl2 in the bulk, i.e.
1 respectively, the volume
2 mol.l−
occupied by the solid CuCl after the dissolution is roughly 5% of the total local volume. Therefore, the small crystals
of CuCl do not signiﬁcantly alter the volume free for the diﬀusion of CuCl2. Moreover, because the CuCl crystalites
do not adhere to the copper metal branches and fall to the bottom of the thin gap cell, the surface of the copper
cluster is constantly renewed and “ready” for corrosion by CuCl2.

A. We deduce from Eq.

3 and 99 g.mol−

≈

2ρo

2. Stable front, asymptotically one-dimensional

The fact that the dissolution process builds a stable (ﬂat) interface can be understood by considering that diﬀusion-
limited corrosion is the “time-reversed” process of diﬀusion-limited aggregation and that the ﬂuctuations of the inter-
face decay rather than grow to reach a stable ﬂat front asymptotically. Krug [62] showed that periodic perturbations
of a ﬂat front of wavelength λ in the direction perpendicular to the direction of motion of the interface would decay
with a characteristic time τ = λ/v. The stability of the corrosion front can therefore be qualitatively understood with
the following argument: the electrolyte most easily reaches the most exposed or least screened parts of the copper
deposit. These bulges are dissolved ﬁrst, and the interface is smoothed.

3. Relevance of 1D approximation of the concentration ﬁeld

In the long-time asymptotic regime, the modulation of the initial concentration of reactant A (CuCl2) relaxes toward
a ﬂat concentration proﬁle along the direction Y whose shape is given by Eq. (26). However, the concentration of
the static reactant B (Cu), as well as the concentration of the product C (CuCl) keep a periodic shape along the Y
direction, which somehow does not alter the one-dimensional asymptotic solution. The largest characteristic length of
the deposit in the direction parallel to the front (Y ) is the mean distance λ between the trees. This puzzling observation
λ2/D, with the
can be understood by comparing the relaxation time of the perturbations of ρA(X, Y ) along Y , τd ∼
λ/ ˙Xf = λ√T /ν√D. Since τf increases with
time needed by the front of copper to move on the same length, τf ∼
time T , in the asymptotic regime it will be much greater than τd. Therefore, whereas ρB is highly correlated along the
Y direction due to the structure of the solid deposit, there are eventually no ﬂuctuations in ρA along this direction.

4. Departure from pure diﬀusion in the reaction zone

The fact that the transference number t+ deduced from t+ = 1

q and the inferred value of q = F (ν) from Eq. (39)
1
1 to 1 mol.l−
decreases signiﬁcantly from 0.33 to 0.21 when the concentration of CuCl2 is increased from 0.5 mol.l−
is unlikely to be caused solely by a pure salt-concentration eﬀect. It is also possible that convection produced by
the sedimentation of CuCl crystallites toward the bottom of the cell could artiﬁcially increase the eﬀective diﬀusion
coeﬃcient close to the reaction front by convective mixing. This would cause an increase of ν(q) (the prefactor for the
speed of the reaction front) which could at least partly explain the diﬀerence in the inferred q values, and therefore
also in the eﬀective t+ values.

−

We have shown that after long times the corrosion of highly porous copper clusters can be understood as a one-
dimensional, homogeneous, mean-ﬁeld A+B
C reaction-diﬀusion process with one diﬀusing and one static reactant.
This is the ﬁrst experimental analysis of such a situation where only one reactant is free to diﬀuse through the other
one. Whereas one would expect highly complex dynamics and a possible breakdown of the mean-ﬁeld approximation
when the reaction is conﬁned to a porous (fractal) interface, we show that in this particular corrosion system, the
dynamics are equivalent to those expected for an homogeneous system. The strength of our demonstration is built
on precise measurements of the concentration ﬁeld of the diﬀusing species by interferometry which are compared
quantitatively with analytical predictions of the one-dimensional mean-ﬁeld model.

Inﬂuence of the Head Group Size on the Direction of Tilt
in Langmuir Monolayers

Abstract -

A model of rods with heads of variable size, which are conﬁned to a planar

surface, is used to study the inﬂuence of the head group size on tilted phases

in Langmuir monolayers. Simple free energy considerations as well as exact

zero temperature calculations indicate that molecules with small head groups

tilt towards next nearest neighbors, and molecules with larger head groups

towards nearest neighbors. This provides a possible explanation for recent

experimental results, and for details of the generic phase diagram for fatty

acid monolayers.

Introduction.

Monolayers of simple amphiphiles at the air-water interface form a complex

variety of condensed phases [1, 2]. A generic phase diagram for fatty acids is

shown in Figure 1. The phase behavior appears to be driven mainly by the

conformations of the aliphatic tails of the molecules. However, head group in-

teractions also play a role, especially in tilted phases. Shih et al [3] and Fischer

et al [4] have recently performed systematic studies of mixtures of heneicosanic

acid and heneicosanol. They ﬁnd that the L2(h,d) phases with tilt towards near-

est neighbors are gradually suppressed, as the alcohols are added to the fatty

acid monolayer, until they ﬁnally disappear at alcohol concentrations above

35 %.

In pure heneicosanol monolayers, only phases with tilt towards next

nearest neighbors exist.

According to a common picture, tilt order in monolayers is often induced

by a mismatch between the head group spacing and the chain diameter. The

size of the head groups plays a crucial role for this mechanism. From the

observation that the zero pressure lattice constant is smaller in heneicosanol

monolayers than in heneicosanic acid monolayers [3], one can deduce that the

eﬀective size of alcohol head groups in water is smaller than that of fatty acid

head groups. The results of Shih et al and Fischer et al therefore suggest that

the head group size also determines the direction of tilt. Further investigations

of surface pressure – temperature phase diagrams for monolayers of fatty acids

with esters by Teer et al [5] are consistent with this picture.

We investigate this possibility in the framework of the simplest possible

theoretical model: Amphiphilic molecules are represented by rigid rods with

heads larger than the rod diameter. We discuss the model ﬁrst using a simple,

2

general free energy ansatz. Our results are conﬁrmed by exact zero temperature

calculations for a system with Lennard-Jones interactions.

2 Free Energy Considerations.

We consider rigid rods of length L with steric repulsive interactions and longer

range attractive interactions; the favorite distance between two rods at given

temperature is rt. The rods have heads of radius rh, which are conﬁned to

a planar surface and arranged on a distorted hexagonal lattice, with variable

lattice constants a and b (Figure 2). Two cases are discussed, tilt in the

direction of a (nearest neighbors, NN) and tilt in the direction of b (next

nearest neighbors, NNN). In this geometry, rods have two diﬀerent types of

neighbors, labelled (i) and (ii) in the following.

The head size gives rise to the geometrical constraints

If the heads are small, rh

rt, the optimal conﬁguration is one of untilted

≤

rods arranged on an undistorted hexagonal lattice, with the lattice constant

a = rt. The volume per rod of the rod layer is then given by V0 = √3/2 r2

t L.

If the heads are larger than the tails, the attractive interactions of the tails

cause them to tilt. This may involve a distortion of the lattice; the surface per

rod A occupied by the monolayer increases, which is in turn penalized by the

surface tension Σ and the surface pressure Π.

Such considerations lead to the free energy ansatz

Our task is to minimize ˜F with respect to the surface A = ab/2 and volume

V = AL cos θ > V0, under the constraints (1) and (3). The remaining indepen-

dent model parameters are Λ and δ. Assuming that k = Λδ is of order unity

or less, the minimum value of ˜F can be expanded in powers of δ. Details of

the calculation are presented in the appendix.

In layers with rods tilted towards next nearest neighbors, the volume per

rod cannot be optimized, because the distance to the neighbors (i) is too large,

a > rh > rt. The free energy is minimized at A = √3r2

The head lattice is not distorted. This is an eﬀect of the “hard” constraints

of eqn (1), i.e. the hard core interactions between heads. If the heads interact

via a softer potential, the lattice gets slightly distorted in the direction of the

tilt.

In layers with rods tilted towards nearest neighbors, the volume per rod

can be optimized, but at the cost of an increased surface energy. Surface and

volume contributions have to be balanced. For large k, k

In the intermediate regime, k

1, the smaller of the two solutions (6) or (7)

∼

applies. Note that the free energy (7) is always larger than (5). Hence rods

tilt towards next nearest neighbors at k

1, or generally if distortions of the

≪

head lattice are not allowed.

Suppose now that Λ is kept ﬁxed, and the head size is gradually increased.

Rods with small heads, δ < δc1 = 0, are untilted. If the heads are just slightly

larger than the tails, 0 < δ < 1/Λ, the case k < 1 applies, and the rods tilt

towards their next nearest neighbors. On increasing the head size (and if Λ is

suﬃciently large), a swiveling transition to a phase with tilt towards nearest

neighbors takes place. The transition point δc2 is located by equating eqn (6)

with eqn (5). One thus gets a sequence of phase transitions at

δc1 = 0

and

δc2 = kc/Λ with kc = 3.93

(8)

to lowest order of δ (Λ > kc/δ0). Note that the transition at δc1 from the

untilted to the tilted state, does not depend on Λ. This is again a consequence

of the hard core interactions between the heads. If the heads are soft, they are

squeezed together at high pressures (i.e., small Λ), and the rods stand up. Note

5

also that the free energy (2) is temperature dependent via the temperature

dependence of the compressibility κ and the surface tension Σ. However, the

model cannot be expected to reproduce thermal properties of a monolayer,

since the hard core interactions between the heads are basically athermal.

3 Exact Ground State Calculations.

In order to test these predictions, we have studied numerically the ground

state of a system of rods with Lennard-Jones interactions between tails and

repulsive soft core interactions between heads. The interaction energy of two

rods at grafting distance ~r, with tilt direction ~eL, is given by

E(~r, ~eL) =

dl dl′ VLJ (d) + Vh(r),

The potentials VLJ and Vh are cut at d = 2 and r = σ, respectively, in order

to make the problem more tractable. The total energy Et is the sum over all

nonzero pair interactions, i.e., the interactions of a rod with up to 24 pairs

[6]. It is minimized with ﬁxed molecular area A by numerical methods. The

surface pressure is obtained using Π =

dEt,min/dA.

−
The lattice constant and the compressibility of a system of inﬁnitely long

rods can be calculated analytically. We identify these parameters with the rod

diameter rt and the volume compressibility κ (rt = 0.9333 and κ = 0, 0184),

6

and σ with the head size rh. This allows a quantitative comparison of the

numerical results with the predictions of the previous section.

The phase diagram for chain length L = 5 is shown in Figure 3. With

increasing head size, one ﬁnds the sequence of phases predicted in section 1:

Untilted (U), Tilt towards next nearest neighbors (NNN) and towards near-

est neighbors (NN). Due to the soft core interactions between the heads, the

ﬁrst transition U-NNN becomes pressure dependent. Apart from this detail,

the results are in qualitative and reasonable quantitative agreement with the

predictions of eqn (8).

4 Discussion.

In sum, we ﬁnd that tilt order can be induced in systems of rods with grafted

heads by a mismatch of head size and rod diameter. Rods with large heads tilt

towards nearest neighbors, and rods with heads just slightly larger than the rod

diameter tilt towards next nearest neighbors. The critical head size, at which

the swiveling transition occurs, increases with pressure and decreases with the

rod length. If distortions of the hexagonal head lattice are not allowed, rods

always tilt towards their next nearest neighbors.

This is in agreement with previous theoretical predictions. Scheringer et al

[7] report that rods grafted on an undistorted hexagonal lattice tilt towards

next nearest neighbors. Kaganer et al [8] ﬁnd that this remains true, even if

one allows for lattice distortions, in systems of pure rods (no heads) which are

forced to tilt by the constraint of a ﬁxed homogeneous surface density (see also

[10]). Some authors study the eﬀect that tilt towards nearest neighbors can be

induced by additional, attractive interactions between the rods and the surface

7

[8, 9]. The present work indicates that it might simply be a consequence of

the larger head group size.

Our eﬀect oﬀers a simple explanation for the observations of Shih et al [3]

and Fischer et al [4], discussed in the introduction. It also provides an inter-

pretation for earlier experimental ﬁndings. In particular, the fact that phases

with tilt towards next nearest neighbors appear at high surface pressures (see

Figure 1), comes out quite naturally.

Shih et al [11] have studied monolayers of heneicosanic acid in the presence

of calcium ions in the subphase, and systematically varied the pH of the sub-

phase. At low pH, they ﬁnd a sequence of phases with tilt towards nearest

neighbors, tilt towards next nearest neighbors, and no tilt, as a function of

pressure. On increasing the pH, the phase tilted towards next nearest neigh-

bors moves down to lower pressures, and ﬁnally replaces the phase with tilt

towards nearest neighbors. At even higher pH, the monolayer is untilted at

all pressures. Assuming that the eﬀective size of the COOH− head groups is

reduced at high pH – e.g., due to more eﬃcient screening of the electrostatic

interactions at higher concentration of positive ions in the subphase – this

result corresponds exactly to the predictions of our model.

To conclude, our simple considerations provide an explanation for a remark-

able variety of experimental observations. Obviously, the real interactions be-

tween head groups in Langmuir monolayers are much more complicated than

those assumed here. Nevertheless, the success of our model suggests that the

inﬂuence of head groups on the microscopic structure of Langmuir monolayers

is to a large extent simply determined by their size.

The infrared absorption spectrum of the protonated water dimer (H5O+

2 ) is simulated in full
−1. The calculations are per-
dimensionality (15D) in the spectral range between 0 and 4000 cm
formed using the Multiconﬁguration Time-Dependent Hartree (MCTDH) method for propagation
of wavepackets. The use of curvilinear coordinates is crucial for the adequate treatment of strong
anharmonicities and large-amplitude torsions of the cation. An exact kinetic energy operator is used
and the potential energy surface employed is that of Huang et al. [JCP,122,044308,(2005)]. Strong
couplings between the proton-transfer and other modes are identiﬁed, and their role in the spectrum
is discussed.

The dynamics and spectroscopy of water clusters [1, 2,
3] of diﬀerent geometries as well as in bulk water [4] has
attracted much research eﬀort, mainly due to the major
importance that proton transfer and general properties
of water have in central areas of chemistry and biology.
Accurate measurements of infrared (IR) spectra of small-
size protonated water clusters have become possible in
recent years [1, 2, 5, 6].

The protonated water dimer, H5O+

2 , the smallest pro-
tonated water cluster, has been recently object of in-
tense study. The infrared (IR) spectrum of the system
has been measured in the gas phase, either using mul-
tiphoton dissociation techniques [1, 5] or measuring the
vibrational predissociation spectrum of H5O+
2 ·RGn clus-
ters with RG=Ar,Ne [2, 6]. The obtained spectra can-
not be consistently assigned in terms of fundamental fre-
quencies and overtones of harmonic vibrational modes
due to the large-amplitude anharmonic motions and cou-
plings of the cluster. Hence, more sophisticated theoret-
ical approaches are required. Several theoretical stud-
ies have been conducted over the last years in order to
understand and assign the IR spectrum of the cation
[2, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11].

The ﬁrst measurement [1] of the IR multiphoton disso-
ciation spectrum (IRMPD) of H5O+
2 spanned the range
between 620 and 1900 cm−1. Three main absorp-
tions were discussed and assigned, based on a previ-
ous quantum-dynamical simulation of the IR absorption
spectrum on a 4D model of the hydrogen-bond (O-H-O)
fragment [8]. Those assignments were revisited in the
context of newer IRMPD experiments and calculations,
producing somewhat disparate results [2, 5, 10, 11]. Re-
cent measurements of the IR predissociation spectrum
of the H5O+
2 cation in argon-solvate [6] and neon- and
argon-solvate [2] conditions present spectra with a sim-
pler structure than the multiphoton IRMPD ones.
It
is expected that the spectrum of the H5O+
2 ·Ne1 com-

plex is close to the linear absorption spectrum of the
bare cation [2]. This spectrum features a doublet struc-
ture in the region of 1000 cm−1 made of two well-deﬁned
absorptions at 928 cm−1 and 1047 cm−1. This doublet
structure has not yet been fully understood, although the
highest-energy component has been already assigned to
the asymmetric proton-stretch fundamental ([O-H-Ok])
[2]. Another doublet structure appears in the experimen-
tal spectrum in the region 1800-1900 cm−1, that would be
related to the water bending motions. At the same time,
recent classical-dynamics simulations on accurate poten-
tial energy surfaces (PES) have shown that the [O-H-Ok]
motion features large amplitude displacements strongly
coupled to other modes of the system. The central-
proton displacement would then be involved in most of
the lines appearing in the IR spectrum, since this mo-
tion relates to the largest changes in the dipole moment
of the cation [10, 11]. Despite recent theoretical and ex-
perimental studies on this system, little is known about
the lowest frequency region, between 0 and 900 cm−1.
Modes vibrating in this frequency range are strongly an-
harmonic, and thus harmonic-vibrational analysis results
are of little value in shedding light on that matter. These
low frequency modes may play also an important role
in combination with the [O-H-Ok] fundamental. Such a
possibility has been already suggested [5, 9, 10], but just
which modes would participate in such combinations, and
how, is still a matter of discussion.

In this letter we report the simulation of the IR linear
absorption spectrum of the H5O+
2 cation in the range
between 0 to 4000 cm−1 by means of a full-dimensional
15D quantum-dynamical treatment, using a set of curvi-
linear internal coordinates to tackle the anharmonicities
and large-amplitude motions of the system. We also re-
port the calculation of some fundamental frequencies and
overtones, namely eigenenergies and eigenstates of the
vibrational Hamiltonian, which are a key to the interpre-

tation and assignment of diﬀerent spectral features. Our
motivation is to illuminate the interpretation of the IR
spectral signatures, which is still an open question. At
the same time we want to stress that it is now possible, by
state-of-the-art quantum-dynamical methods, to solve a
15D ﬂoppy and anharmonic molecular system with high
accuracy, both in the time-dependent as well as in the
time-independent representation. To address the prob-
lem, we make use of the potential energy surface (PES)
and dipole-moment surfaces recently developed by Bow-
man and collaborators [7], which constitute the most ac-
curate ab initio surfaces available to date for this system.
The quantum-dynamical problem is solved in the time-
dependent picture using the multiconﬁguration time de-
pendent Hartree method (MCTDH)[12, 13]. MCTDH
is an eﬃcient algorithm to solve the time-dependent
Schr¨odinger equation by means of a variationally optimal
muticonﬁgurational expansion of the wavefunction. Each
conﬁguration is given by a Hartree-product of functions
depending on a single or a group of degrees of freedom,
the so-called single-particle functions (SPF). Both the
multiconﬁgurational expansion coeﬃcients and the SPF
are allowed to vary simultaneously in time, which dra-
matically reduces the amount of conﬁgurations necessary
to achieve a converged propagation as compared to the
standard, numerically exact, propagation method. By
controlling the number of conﬁgurations, MCTDH can
be made as close to exact as desired, at the cost of an
increased computational eﬀort. The MCTDH program is
also capable of using the time-independent picture, allow-
ing for the convergence to eigenstates and eigenenergies
of the Hamiltonian at hand. The algorithm that imple-
ments this feature is called improved relaxation [13, 14].
This algorithm is essentially a multiconﬁguration self-
consistent ﬁeld approach that takes advantage of the
MCTDH machinery. Several eigenenergies and eigen-
states have been calculated using improved relaxation.
They are invaluable in the assignments of some bands
coming from the time-dependent calculation of the IR
spectrum, and provide a total characterization of the cor-
responding states in terms of their fully-correlated wave-
functions. All the reported simulations were performed
with the Heidelberg MCTDH package of programs [15].
The Hamiltonian is expressed in a set of polyspheri-
cal coordinates based on Jacobi vectors [16]. This set of
coordinates allows for an adequate treatment of the an-
harmonic large-amplitude vibrations and torsions of the
molecule. The kinetic energy operator is exact for J = 0,
and the derivation of its lengthy formula (674 terms) will
be discussed in a forthcoming publication. The correct-
ness of the operator implemented was checked by com-
parison with data generated by the TNUM program [17].
The internal coordinates used are: the distance between
the centers of mass of both water molecules (R), the po-
sition of the central proton with respect to the center of
mass of the water dimer (x,y,z), the Euler angles deﬁning

the relative orientation between the two water molecules
(waggings: γa, γb; rockings: βa, βb; internal relative ro-
tation: α) and the Jacobi coordinates which account
for the particular conﬁguration of each water molecule
(r1(a,b), r2(a,b), θ(a,b))) where r1x is the distance between
the oxygen atom and the center of mass of the corre-
sponding H2 fragment, r2x is the H–H distance and θx is
the angle between these two vectors. These coordinates
have the great advantage of leading to a much more de-
coupled representation of the PES than a normal-mode
based Hamiltonian.

As outlined above, the wavefunction is represented by
products of SPFs which in turn are represented by dis-
crete variable representation (DVR) grids. The total
primitive product-grid consists of 1.3 × 1015 points. This
number makes clear that the potential must be repre-
sented in a more compact form to make calculations fea-
sible. We choose to represent the PES as follows: the
coordinates are divided in ﬁve groups, g1 ≡ [x, y, z, α],
g2 ≡ [γa, γb], g3 ≡ [R, βa, βb], g4 ≡ [r1a, r2a, θa] and
g5 ≡ [r1b, r2b, θb]. The potential is then expanded as

terms are the intra-

other groups at the reference geometry, while the ˆv(2)

terms account for the group-group correlations. The po-
tential with up to second-order terms gives already a very
reasonable description of the system. The ˆv(3)

counts for three-mode correlations between the displace-
ment of the central proton, the distance between both
water molecules and the angular wagging and rocking
motions. This PES representation may be sequentially

while the rocking fundamentals, which are degenerate,
have an energy of 456 cm−1.

improved in a convergent series by adding more correc-
tion terms where coordinates belonging to three or more
diﬀerent groups are allowed to vary simultaneously. How-
ever, the PES in Eq. 1 is found to reproduce the full po-
tential very well, providing a converged zero-point energy
of 12376.3 cm−1, 16 cm−1 below the reported Diﬀusion-
Monte-Carlo result [19] on the full potential.

In Fig. 2 the probability-density projection on the wag-
ging coordinates is shown for the ground vibrational state
(g0), as well as for one of the two fundamental states
(w1a,w1b) of the wagging modes, which are degenerate
vibrational states with an energy of 106 cm−1. The en-
ergies of the next three wagging-mode states (w2,w3,w4)
are, respectively, 232, 374 and 422 cm−1. State w3 is
shown in Fig. 2c. State w2 has an energy that nearly dou-
bles the energy of the w1x states, since it has been seen to
roughly correspond to one quantum in state w1a and one
quantum in state w1b. The strong anharmonicity of the
wagging motions can be further appreciated in the pro-
gression of w2, w3 and w4 vibrational-state energies. In
addition, the harmonic-analysis energies of the two lowest
wagging-fundamentals w1a and w1b are around 300 cm−1
larger than the MCTDH result and do not account for
their degeneracy, since harmonic modes are constructed
taking as a reference the C2v absolute minimum. The
system, however, interconverts between equivalent C2v
minima and other stationary points through low-energy
barriers (wagging motions and internal rotation), which
leads to a highly symmetric ground-state wavefunction.
The vibrational levels of H5O+
2 can be labeled according
to the symmetry group G16, which is related to the D2d
point group but with allowed permutation of the H-atoms
within each of the two monomers [20]. The two lowest
excited wagging/rocking modes transform according to
an E representation within this symmetry group.

Figure 3 presents the IR predissociation spectrum of
the H5O+
2 ·Ne complex [2] and the MCTDH spectrum
of H5O+
2 in the range 700-1900 cm−1. The MCTDH
spectrum is obtained in the time-dependent picture by
Fourier transformation of the autocorrelation of the
dipole-operated intial state [21]:

where E0 is the ground-state energy and |Ψµ,0i ≡ ˆµ |Ψ0i.
The MCTDH spectrum shows a good agreement with
the experimental spectrum. The agreement on the dou-
blet structure around 1000 cm−1 is very good, and the
position of the doublet at 1700 - 1800 cm−1 is also in
good agreement, despite the relative intensities being
larger in MCTDH. The doublet absorption at around
1000 cm−1 deserves a deeper analysis. Due to the high
density of states, it was not possible, by means of im-
proved relaxation, to obtain the fully converged states,
but reasonably good approximations to the wavefunc-
tions of the low-energy (|Ψl
di, 930 cm−1) and high en-
ergy (|Ψh
d i, 1021 cm−1) eigenstates of the doublet were
computed. Even though these wavefunctions contain all
the possible information on the two states, their direct
analysis becomes complex due to the high dimensional-
ity of such objects.
In order to obtain a fundamental
understanding of the observed bands, zeroth-order, i. e.
Hartree, states are constructed by diagonalization of 1-
mode Hamiltonian operators, where the modes are those
deﬁned around Eq. 1. The two eigenstates corresponding
to the doublet are then projected onto the zeroth-order
states. Two of them are found to play a major role: |Φzi,
with one quantum of excitation in the proton-transfer co-
ordinate, and |ΦR,w3i, with one quantum in [O-Ok] and

three quanta in the wagging motion. The corresponding
di|2 = 0.44
overlaps read:
and |hΦz|Ψh
d i|2 = 0.04. The over-
laps with other Hartree states are much smaller. One
should take into account that these numbers depend on
the exact deﬁnition of the zeroth-order states, which is
not unique. Also, the zeroth-order states do not span the
same space as the two eigenstates, so the overlaps do not
add up to 1. However, they provide a clear picture of
the nature of the doublet: the low-energy band has the
largest contribution from the combination of the sym-
metric stretch and the third excited wagging (see Fig.
2), whereas the second largest is the proton-transfer mo-
tion. For the high-energy band the importance of these
two contributions is reversed. Thus, the doublet may be
regarded as a Fermi resonance between two zero-order
states which are characterized by (1R, 3w) and (1z) ex-
citations, respectively. The reason why the third wagging
excitation plays an important role in the proton-transfer
doublet is understood by inspecting Fig. 2c. The proba-
bility density of this state has four maxima, each of which
corresponds to a planar conformation of H2O-H+ (H3O+
character) for one of the waters, and a bend conformation
(H2O character) where a lone-pair H2O orbital forms a
hydrogen bond with the central proton. When the proton
oscillates between the two waters, the two conformations
exchange their characters accordingly.

The simulated spectrum in the range between 0 and
4000 cm−1 is depicted in Fig. 4. The region below 700
cm−1 has not yet been accessed experimentally. Direct
absorption of the wagging motions, excited by the x and
y components of the dipole operator, appears in the range
between 100 - 200 cm−1. The doublet starting at 1700
cm−1 is clearly related to bending motions of the water
molecules, but its exact nature is still to be addressed.
The MCTDH spectrum also shows the absorptions of the
OH stretchings starting at 3600 cm−1.

To summarize, in this work we report the simulation of

the IR absorption spectrum of the H5O+
2 cation by means
of the quantum-dynamical MCTDH method, using an
exact kinetic-energy operator and an accurate potential
energy surface. The use of curvilinear coordinates was es-
sential because only then the strongly anharmonic large-
amplitude motions (waggings, torsion, rockings) could be
described conveniently. The reported simulations show a
good agreement with the predissociation spectrum of the
H5O+
2 ·Ne complex. Moreover, they clarify various fea-
tures of the IR spectrum that remained elusive due to
complicated anharmonicities and couplings.

The very good performance of modern density functional theory for molecular geometries and

harmonic vibrational frequencies has been well established. We investigate the performance of

density functional theory (DFT) for quartic force ﬁelds, vibrational anharmonicity and rotation-

vibration coupling constants, and thermodynamic functions beyond the RRHO (rigid rotor-

harmonic oscillator) approximation of a number of small polyatomic molecules. Convergence in

terms of basis set, integration grid and the numerical step size for determining the quartic force

ﬁeld by using central diﬀerences of analytical second derivatives has been investigated, as well

as the performance of various exchange-correlation functionals. DFT is found to oﬀer a cost-

eﬀective approach with manageable scalability for obtaining anharmonic molecular properties, and

particularly as a source for anharmonic zero-point and thermal corrections for use in conjunction

with benchmark ab initio thermochemistry methods.

INTRODUCTION

The Kohn-Sham formulation of Density Functional Theory (DFT) is nowadays

a commonly used tool

in computational chemistry, being frequently applied to

thermodynamics, structures, harmonic frequencies of various chemical compounds. Despite

its successes in the accurate prediction of most ground-state and some excited state

properties of molecules, its usefulness for calculating anharmonic force ﬁelds is less ﬁrmly

established.

Anharmonic force ﬁelds allow direct comparison between computed and observed

spectroscopic transitions, as opposed to comparing computed harmonic apples with

observed anharmonic oranges, all the while making ‘hand-waving’ approximations about

the importance of anharmonicity. The cost of high-quality ab initio anharmonic force ﬁeld

calculations rapidly becomes prohibitive as the number of atoms increases, and the relatively

low cost of DFT calculations — as well as the fairly routine availability of analytical second

derivatives — makes them attractive potential alternatives.

Until about two years ago, DFT anharmonic force ﬁeld studies were rather scarce.

Dressler and Thiel studied H2O, F2O, and CH3F using several generalized gradient

approximation (GGA) functionals[1]. Detailed studies had been done for diatomics[2, 3],

with the respective authors claiming very high accuracy. Concerning larger molecules, the

full quartic force ﬁeld of ammonia[4], benzene[5] and diazomethane[6] have been studied

with a hybrid density functional.

In the last couple of years, an increasing number of anharmonic force ﬁelds using density

have been published and several groups have been working on this subject. Noteworthy

are the activities in the Handy group with studies of furan, pyrrole and thiophene[7] and

phosphorus pentaﬂuoride[8], which in fact yielded even more accurate results on these

medium-sized organic systems than suggested by the small-molecule validation studies cited

above.

In addition to this, the group of Hess[9] (using the B3LYP[10] and BP86[11]

functionals) and Barone[12] (using B3LYP) have published validation studies on a small

number of mainly triatomic molecules. Furthermore, two of us published a detailed study

on the azabenzene series, also exploring the possibility of combining DFT anharmonic force

ﬁelds with coupled cluster geometries and harmonic frequencies[13]. Barone carried out a

similar study on the azabenzenes using a diﬀerent functional and basis set[14].

Another potential application of

interest

concerns high-accuracy computational

thermochemistry. Computed molecular atomization energies require zero-point vibrational

energies (ZPVEs) and thermal corrections. As molecules grow, ZPVEs make up an

increasingly important part of the molecular binding energy — e.g., 62.08 kcal/mol in

benzene[15] — and approximations about the anharmonic contribution to the ZPVE

introduce ever larger sources of potential error. This issue becomes especially acute

with nonempirical extrapolation-based methods like W1, W2, and W3 theory[16, 17] or

explicitly correlated methods like CC-R12[18], which can fairly routinely yield atomization

energies to sub-kcal/mol accuracy.

Thermal corrections at room temperature can

reasonably be expected to be reproduced fairly well

for semirigid molecules, but in

applications where high-temperature data are important (e.g., combustion modeling),

vibrational anharmonicity, rovibrational coupling, and centrifugal distortion signiﬁcantly

aﬀect thermodynamic functions (see, e.g., Refs.[19, 20]). All the required molecular

properties can be readily obtained by vibrational perturbation theory when calculating the

quartic force ﬁeld of the respective compound[21, 22, 23, 24, 25].

Since the computation of a quartic force ﬁeld using density functional theory is unlikely

to require more computer time than Wn or explicitly correlated methods, it could become

a routine step in such studies. It was previously shown[26] that the use of accurate ZPVEs

from large-scale ab initio anharmonic force ﬁeld calculations, instead of scaled B3LYP/cc-

pVTZ harmonic frequencies, improved the mean absolute error of W2 theory over the W2-1

set of 28 small molecules (with very precisely known experimental binding energies) from

0.30 to 0.23 kcal/mol, and the maximum absolute error from 0.78 to 0.64 kcal/mol. This

can be compared to the error when including up to connected quadruple excitations in the

extrapolation scheme, where the mean absolute error (over a sample additionally including

some molecules beset with nondynamical correlation) is reduced from 0.40 (W2) to 0.22

Assuming that we would like to achieve the best accuracy possible, we ought to be able

to mitigate the error introduced by the ZPVE by using quartic DFT force ﬁelds to calculate

(W3) kcal/mol.

the anharmonic corrections.

Of course, other approaches than vibrational perturbation theory could be used in

conjunction with density functional methods, such as the VSCF-CC method[27, 28, 29,

30, 31, 32]. However, as these methods are presently J = 0 (i.e., rotational ground

3

state) methods, the eﬀects of rovibrational coupling and centrifugal distortion on the

thermodynamic functions would have to be neglected.

In the present work, we report on a detailed validation study of DFT methods for all these

properties, and will consider the dependence of their accuracy on the exchange-correlation

functional, the basis set, the quality of the numerical integration grid, and the step size used

in numerical diﬀerentiation.

II. COMPUTATIONAL DETAILS

Following the approach ﬁrst proposed by Schneider and Thiel[24], a full cubic and

a semidiagonal quartic force ﬁeld are obtained by central numerical diﬀerentiation (in

rectilinear normal coordinates about the equilibrium geometry) of analytical second
derivatives. The latter were obtained by means of locally modiﬁed versions of gaussian
98[33]; modiﬁed routines from cadpac[34] were used as the driver for the numerical

diﬀerentiation. routine. In this approach, the potential energy surface is expanded through

quartic terms at the global minimum geometry like:

where the qi are dimensionless rectangular normal coordinates, ωi are harmonic frequencies,

and φijk and φijkl third and fourth derivatives with respect to the qi at the equilibrium

All the force ﬁelds have been analyzed by means of the spectro[35] and polyad[36]

respectively.

In all cases, when strong Fermi resonances lead to band origins perturbed more than

about 2 cm−1 from their second-order position, the deperturbed values are reported and

resonance matrices diagonalized to obtain the true band origins. Rotational constants were

similarly deperturbed for strong Coriolis resonances.

Thermodynamic functions beyond the harmonic approximation are obtained by means of

the integration of asymptotic series method as implemented in the NASA PAC99 program

of McBride and Gordon[37].

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

To avoid issues with experimental data, such as problems with the assignment of the

spectra as has been reported in our previous study[13], we decided to solely compare our

results to ab initio (coupled cluster) data of quartic force ﬁelds which have been published for

molecules with more than two atoms. Here, 17 molecules, namely C2H2[38], C2H4[39], CCl2,

CF2[20], CH2NH[40], CH2[41], CH4[42], H2CO[43], H2O[19], H2S[45], HCN[44], N2O[46],

NH2[47], PH3[48], SiF4[49], SiH4[50], and SO2[51], have been included with some of the

older data being recalculated with a more extended basis set.

A. Numerical quadrature

First of all, we have to investigate the dependence on the integration grid. We shall

restrict ourselves to the HCTH/407 functional[52], using a TZ2P basis set for the H2O, SO2

and N2O molecules together with a step size of 0.02 a.u.

for the central diﬀerences. The

grids considered here are direct products of Euler-Maclaurin radial grids[53] ranging from 75

to 400 points, with Lebedev angular grids[54] ranging from 194 to 974 points. In addition,

we considered some ‘pruned’ grids, in which the radial coordinate is divided into ﬁve zones

(inner core, inner valence, valence, outer valence, and long-range) and diﬀerent angular grid

densities are used for each zone. The ‘SG1’, ’Medium’, ’Fine’, and ’Ultraﬁne’ standard
grids in gaussian 9x correspond to pruned (50,194), (75,194), (75,302), and (99,590) grids,

respectively. Inter-atom partitioning was done according to Ref.[55].

Let us ﬁrst consider the error in the oﬀ-diagonal stretching anharmonicity, relative to our

largest grid (unpruned 400
974). Unfortunately, sizable errors are seen for the standard
gaussian-type grids, both due to their small intrinsic size and to the pruning. Hence, they

×

cannot be recommended for this type of calculation, since these values are quite signiﬁcant

for the calculation of the thermodynamic functions and fundamental frequencies. The results

are shown in Figure 1a to Figure 1c. As it is apparent from these ﬁgures, a very large number

of radial grid points is needed for the accurate description of the quartic force ﬁeld. From

the values in Figure 1, we conclude that a 200

974 grid for our calculations if the molecules

include only ﬁrst-row atoms, and the 300

974 grid otherwise will be suﬃcient. We modiﬁed

the code to add two additional pruned grids, 140

974 and 199

974 (which are invoked

×

by new keywords ’Grid=Huge’ and ’Grid=Insane’, respectively). For these intrinsically

ﬁner-meshed grids, pruning deteriorates numerical precision less, and if 1 cm−1 precision is

suﬃcient, the ‘Huge’ grid will be generally adequate for ﬁrst-row, and the ‘Insane’ grid for

second-row molecules.

Unfortunately, Gaussian does permit using diﬀerent radial grids on diﬀerent atoms,

although such variation can be somewhat simulated by manipulation of the pruning zone

boundaries. It is however possible to use a diﬀerent (coarser) grid in the CPKS (coupled-

perturbed Kohn-Sham) steps, and here we were able to reduce grid size to as small as

SG1 (i.e., pruned 75

194), thus reducing overall computational cost. For instance, for

methylene imine CH2NH, this approximation reduced CPU time by half, while the computed
fundamental frequencies change by less than 0.2 cm−1. The importance of using a very large

energy+gradients grid is apparent for this molecule as well: Even a relatively large 99

590

(or in its pruned version, ‘Ultraﬁne’) grid will yield errors for some frequencies of more

than 8 cm−1, and the 140

590 grid errors of 1 cm−1. We expect similar behavior for other

quantum chemical program systems, where grid sizes will likewise need to be increased well

beyond what is normally required. Needless to say, errors are further exacerbated if one

×

×

of the fundamentals aﬀected by grid error is involved in a strong Fermi resonance. For

example, in CH2NH, the change in going from a pruned 75

302 to an unpruned 140

590

×

CPHF grid changes the eigenvalues of the fundamentals aﬀected by Fermi resonances by

about ten cm−1. The deperturbed values, however, change by less than 0.5 cm−1. Although

this is clearly undesirable (and an inherent weakness of the method), in such a situation

it becomes unclear which grid is actually the best to use, since even at large grid sizes the

×

×

changes are signiﬁcant.

B. Basis set

For the basis sets investigated, we have used Dunning’s cc-pVnZ and aug-cc-pVnZ

correlation consistent basis sets for the ﬁrst row[56], and the cc-pV(n+d)Z and aug-cc-

pV(n+d)Z basis sets of Wilson, Peterson, and Dunning for the second row. (The latter

include additional high-exponent d functions, which have been shown to be important[51]

for spectroscopic constants of molecules in which a second-row atom is surrounded by one

of more highly electronegative ﬁrst-row atoms.) As for smaller basis sets, we considered

6

the TZ2P[58] and DZP [59] basis sets. (Note that the TZ2P version used by most groups

actually includes a third d function for second-row atoms.) In all, we investigated the aug-

cc-pVQZ, cc-pVQZ, aug-cc-pVTZ, cc-pVTZ, TZ2P and DZP basis sets, using the B97-1

hybrid functional[60] and a step size of 0.02 Bohr. Here, we compare to the largest basis set

(aug-cc-pVQZ), which for DFT calculations of these properties is close to the Kohn-Sham

basis set limit. In ﬁgure 2, now the mean errors of the zero-point energies are shown for

the C2H4, H2O, SO2 and N2O molecules, in addition to the overall error of the functional

compared to coupled cluster data. The latter data shows when the basis error becomes

signiﬁcant enough to aﬀect the error made by the functional itself. This happens only to the

DZP basis set, although its overall mean error compared to the reference data is not larger

than for the largest basis set employed. For the TZ2P basis, there seems to be some error

compensation for this functional. Basically, the error made by the cc-pVTZ basis set is still

very small compared to the aug-cc-pVQZ basis set, with the TZ2P basis set error still being

signiﬁcantly smaller than the functional error and the DZP basis set error being comparable.

Thus, from these results, either the TZ2P or cc-pVTZ basis sets seem preferable, with the

DZP basis set being an option for the very largest molecules.

C. Step size for numerical diﬀerentiation

As a third variable, an optimal numerical step size has to be determined. In a numerical

derivatives calculation, it always represents a compromise between discretization error and

roundoﬀ error. All calculations have been done using an unpruned 200

590 grid for CH2NH,

×

a molecule which proved to be very much aﬀected by step size issues. For the ﬁrst three

modes, we compare to the deperturbed values to circumvent the diﬃculties mentioned above.

In order to reduce roundoﬀ error as much as possible, the KS and CPKS equations were

basically converged to machine precision.

We considered ﬁve diﬀerent approaches to the step size. All of them have been done along

the unnormalized Cartesian displacement vectors of the mass weighted normal coordinates,

such as[62]:

~r = ~r + qstep(i)

~l

×

(2)

All stepsizes qstep(i) are in bohr

amu. In the ﬁrst, a constant ‘one size ﬁts all’ displacement

×

7

was made in all modes:

qstep(i) = constant

In the second, we employed a variable step size proportional to the square root of the

reduced mass for each particular vibration:

qstep(i) = constant

µ
amu

× r

This corresponds to normalising the displacement vector to have the same stepsize for

diﬀerent isotopes.

The third approach is to choose a step size such that within the harmonic oscillator

approximation, the displacement in that particular mode causes a certain given energy

change, e.g., 1 millihartree as in Ref.[5]

The fourth approach is to choose an unnormalised stepsize dependent on the force

constant k. The is achieved by dividing through the reduced mass and the frequency of

the corresponding mode:

qstep(i) = constant

1

Finally, in the ﬁfth approach we make the step size dependent on both the reduced mass

and the absolute value of the harmonic frequency associated with the normal coordinate

involved:

qstep(i) = constant

Furthermore,

in the absence of an analytical fourth derivatives code which would by

deﬁnition render the ‘true’ answer, we can attempt determining the latter by means of

Richardson extrapolation[63]. At the lowest level, we combine two diﬀerent step sizes h and

2h at the position x and reduce the error like:

D1 = φjjjj(x) + O(h2) =

D2 = φjjjj(x) + O(4h2) =

ωj(x + h) + ωj(x

This formula is actually equivalent to the use of a ﬁve-point fourth-order central diﬀerence

formula. The Richardson approach can be applied recursively in order to minimize

discretization error: with level m estimates having an error term O(h2m), the next level
Richardson estimate D[m]

1) will have an error O(h2m+2).

We have tightened convergence criteria at all stages of the electronic structure calculations

to 10−10 or better (no convergence could be achieved with even tighter criteria). Yet even

so, unacceptable roundoﬀ error is introduced for small step sizes. As a result, Richardson

extrapolation is only reliable for rather large step sizes, as can be seen in Table I. The

last column shows the most accurate values, combining the step sizes of 0.10, 0.12 and 0.14

bohr. Even when including the step size of 0.08 bohr (in column 8) into the formula, we

probably see some roundoﬀ error, explaining the (small) diﬀerence of up to 3 cm−1 between

both values — nevertheless, we expect the algorithm to be nearly converged. Comparing
methods (1-5, method 1 with a stepsize of 0.025 ˚A), the maximum (mean absolute) errors

compared to the last column (our reference, in fact) are 4 (1.6), 4 (1.2), 9 (4.0), 8 (2.1) and

1 (0.2) cm−1. All methods (except method 3) have been calculated by ﬁnding an optimal

constant stepsize prefactor, which is shown in the second line of Table I. This constant

prefactor is very important which becomes apparent when looking at mode 1 and mode 7

to 9 of method 1: For large frequencies (like mode 1), a small step size is needed as can be

seen when comparing to the reference values. The error at 0.12 bohr for this mode will be

as large as 30 cm−1. On the other hand, a step size of 0.02 bohr yields errors of 50 cm−1

for mode 7 and 30 cm−1 for mode 8. The spurious interchange of fundamentals 8 and 9 at

this step size could even lead to an incorrect assignment. Thus, the choice of step size is

critical when calculating quartic force ﬁelds, and a worst-case error of about 5 cm−1 still

needs to be assumed even with all step size algorithms. These step size issues in fact transfer

to all molecules investigated, as we have done also with method (4). Here, the force ﬁelds

are (compared to our reference coupled cluster values), as a rule of thumb, about twice as

bad as when using method (5). The only fundamental remedy would be the calculation of

third Kohn-Sham derivatives and taking numerical ﬁrst derivatives of these, which to our

knowledge has not been implemented in any quantum chemical code.

D. Exchange-correlation functionals

For assessing the diﬀerent currently available density functionals for this problem, we

employed several GGA functionals (BLYP[64], HCTH407[52], PBE [65]) and hybrid density

functionals (B3LYP[10], B97-1[60], B97-2[66], and PBE0[67]). For all these functionals, we

consider the full validation set of 17 molecules mentioned above.

For this purpose, we used both the TZ2P and cc-pVTZ basis sets to look at the

performance of the functionals for the diﬀerent basis sets. Although force ﬁelds for all the

aforementioned molecules have been calculated with the two basis sets mentioned, the C2H2

molecule required diﬀuse functions to yield qualitatively correct bending anharmonicities.

This is consistent with results obtained by ab initio correlation methods (which generate

spurious positive anharmonicities with standard basis sets), whereas Hartree-Fock renders

negative anharmonic corrections even without the use of diﬀuse functions[38]. In all tables

and ﬁgures, results for C2H2 thus refer to the aug-cc-pVTZ basis set. In the case of the

symmetric tops CH4, SiH4 and SiF4, we perturbed the masses of the hydrogens by 0.0001

atomic mass units in order to break symmetry. Here, Coriolis coupling between the now

non-degenerate frequencies had to be taken into account. For CH2, a quasi-linear molecule,

both B97-1 and HCTH/407 yield positive anharmonic corrections when using the TZ2P

basis set- those were the only calculations excluded from our evaluation. For CH2NH, we
were unable to use spectro due to the complicated resonances in this molecule (see Ref.[40]
9 perturbation matrix from polyad

for a discussion) — the deperturbed values of the 9

×

were consistently used instead.

In ﬁgure 3, the RMS and mean absolute errors of the zero-point energies for all the

molecules mentioned above are shown. Discussing the GGA functionals, HCTH/407 is a vast

improvement over both PBE and BLYP, reducing their RMS error by almost a factor of two.

Still, it is not quite comparable to the hybrid functionals, which render the lowest errors.

The error in their zero-point energies is another factor of two lower than the one obtained

by HCTH/407. The scaled B3LYP harmonic zero-point energy displays an error compared

to HCTH/407. The error is about 0.33 kcal/mol, compared to 0.13 to 0.19 kcal/mol for the

hybrid functionals. Here, B97-1 and B3LYP yield the lowest errors around 0.14 kcal/mol

for both basis sets. For the cc-pVTZ basis set, all functionals yield a marginally worse

zero-point energy compared to the TZ2P basis set. This is in line with our previous studies

10

on geometries[68], where the combination of DFT/cc-pVTZ generally showed larger errors

compared than DFT/TZ2P. Generally, the B3LYP functional returns results about 50%

better than the ZPE determined by scaled B3LYP.

Discussing the fundamental frequencies in table II, we can evaluate the accuracy of density

functionals for the calculation of such properties which might prove useful when assigning

experimental IR-spectra. All hybrid functionals yield RMS errors between 30 and 40 cm−1

for the 103 frequencies investigated, with B97-1/TZ2P showing consistently the lowest errors.

All pure GGA functionals underestimate both harmonic and fundamental frequencies by at

least 25 cm−1, casting doubt on any values computed by such methods. The diﬀerence

between the errors of the calculated anharmonic and harmonic frequencies, shown in the

ﬁrst four columns, which are almost negligible and very large in comparison to those just

done in the correction (last two columns). The latter emphasizes the agreement when using

accurate harmonic frequencies from a higher level method such as CCSD(T). For such a

combined method, the RMS errors are between 6 and 11 cm−1, with surprisingly the hybrid

functionals such as B97-1 and PBE0 having errors around 9 cm−1 and HCTH/407 and BLYP

around 6 cm−1. In comparison, determining the anharmonic correction by simply scaling

the harmonic frequency by a constant factor fails completely: Its RMS error is as large as

for the fundamental frequencies itself.

As for the zero-point energies, HCTH/407 is slightly more accurate than the scaled

B3LYP harmonic frequencies, and BLYP is somewhat less accurate than PBE for our

validation set. Overall, we can expect an accuracy of about 30 cm−1 or less when calculating

fundamental frequencies for a diverse set of semirigid molecules using perturbation theory.

This is much more than we would expect for organic molecules[13], but consistent with

previous studies on a larger number of harmonic frequencies[69].

Returning to zero-point energies, these will be much improved when including harmonic

frequencies at the reference level and just adding DFT anharmonic corrections. These errors

are displayed in Figure 4, and can be readily compared to those obtained in Figure 3 (note

the diﬀerent scale of both ﬁgures). The error is reduced by at least a factor of ﬁve, showing

the superiority of such a combined method. As for the anharmonic corrections, the GGA

functionals BLYP and HCTH/407 yield the lowest errors, about reducing the errors of the

hybrid functionals by 50%. In comparison, simply using the scaled B3LYP frequencies shows

no improvement, as the RMS error would remain unchanged at 0.33 kcal/mol.

11

An additional observable obtained when calculating the anharmonic force ﬁeld is the

rotational constant. While Ae, Be and Ce are only dependent on the electronic minimum

geometry, the vibrationally averaged A0, B0 and C0 are accessible by experiment. In Table

III, the mean and RMS errors (in %) for the 37 symmetry-unique rotational constants of the
16 molecules investigated are displayed. For the correction Ae −
the errors in %, since the reference values are already very small and thus large relative

A0 we chose not to report

errors are made by the functionals. As expected, the GGA functionals fare worse than

the hybrid functionals with the exception of the HCTH/407 functional. This exceptional

property of HCTH/407 has been reported before[69, 70], with its geometry errors reduced by

half in comparison to the other GGA functionals. For the hybrid functionals, the cc-pVTZ

basis set gives lower errors than TZ2P, with the opposite for all GGA functionals. The

accuracy of the hybrid functionals range from 0.06 to 0.13 cm−1 (0.9 to 1.25 %) for Ae and

A0. When only comparing the correction Re-R0 to these values, the error will be cut in half.

This contrasts the RMS errors of the frequencies, where the anharmonic correction has an

error which is about ﬁve times as low as the error of the frequency itself. Thus, adding the

corrections for example to CCSD(T) structures will not be as rewarding as it was the case

in the previous paragraph. As in Table II for the anharmonic corrections, all functionals

now give quite similar errors.

E. Thermodynamic functions

Finally, we turn to thermodynamic functions evaluated by four diﬀerent methods and

compare them to our reference values. Since rotational and vibrational levels contribute to

those, error cancellation can take eﬀect here.

In Table IV (method 1), the heat capacity, the diﬀerence of the enthalpy at a given

temperature and the enthalpy at 0K, and the entropy are given at room temperature, 600

K and 2000 K. Whereas there is little diﬀerence between both basis sets, the functionals

show the expected behavior, with the hybrid functionals and HCTH/407 giving quite similar

errors. BLYP and PBE are again the worst performers, their errors being about twice as

large. For the heat capacity, the initial error at 298.15 K is larger than the error at 600 K

for all functionals, suggesting some error cancellation at this value.

The relative importance of various post-RRHO contributions at high temperature (say,

12

2000 K) varies somewhat with the molecule. For H2O, vibrational anharmonicity and

centrifugal stretching are about equally important, rovibrational coupling rather less so.

For CH2NH, vibrational anharmonicity predominates, with rovibrational coupling a distant

second. For both C2H2 and N2O, vibrational anharmonicity far outweighs the two other

contributions. In SO2 a balance between the three contributions prevails.

When applying the RRHO approximation using just harmonic frequencies and bottom-of-

the-well rotational constants, as reported in Table V (method 2), somewhat surprising results

are obtained: At low temperatures (room temperature), this method is easily competitive

to calculating the full force ﬁeld. In fact, most errors will be lower when using the RRHO

approximation in conjunction with DFT for this temperature[71]. Especially the errors of

BLYP and PBE are reduced and comparable to the hybrid functionals for all temperatures.

Again, there is barely any diﬀerence between the two basis sets. At 600 K, the entropy and

enthalpy show the same behavior, only the heat capacity already has an error twice as high

than when calculating the force ﬁeld. At 2000 K, the errors of the RRHO approximation

becomes quite large, with a factor of two (for the entropy) up to ﬁve (for enthalpy and heat

capacity) between Table IV and Table V. Thus, when calculating such properties at room

temperature, the error in the DFT method itself will be large compared to the error by

making such an approximation. Taking just the coupled cluster frequencies and rotational

constants from the reference method shows a similar behavior, with the errors naturally

reduced in comparison to DFT by another factor of two for 298.15 K. At 600K, the error

becomes already comparable to the one obtained by the best density functionals, and at

2000 K it is even higher in many cases.

Table VI (method 3) represents a common compromise between the RRHO approximation

and using the full scale quartic force ﬁeld — especially when working from experimental data.

Here, anharmonic frequencies and vibrationally averaged rotational constants are substituted

in the RRHO approximation and all additional eﬀects of anharmonicity, rovibrational

coupling, and centrifugal stretching are neglected. At low temperatures, this method

basically yields the same results as fully anharmonic calculations. The diﬀerence between

both methods is less than 5% at room temperature and 600 K, with BLYP and PBE

yielding again larger errors than the hybrid functionals. At 2000 K, however, neglecting

these terms causes a large loss in accuracy, although the errors are not as large as when

completely neglecting anharmonic eﬀects. Still, the error in the heat capacity (normally the

13

most sensitive quantity, as it involves the second moment of the partition function) is only

lowered by about 20%, and the error of the entropy and enthalpy approximately by a third.

Method 3 is thus an acceptable solution at low temperatures, and a stop-gap solution at

elevated temperatures (around 600 K) when no quartic force ﬁeld is available. By replacing

the density functional values by the ones of our reference method, the error becomes much

smaller. Again, an estimate can be made when this method becomes unreliable – this will be

only at very large temperatures above 600 K. Of course, it requires the calculation of a full

CCSD(T) force ﬁeld which is done in our reference calculations, which would be prohibitive

for many molecules.

Finally, the last method (4), shown in Table VII, includes all the eﬀects covered in

method 1, but in addition the equilibrium geometry and harmonic frequencies from the

reference coupled cluster calculation were substituted in the rovibrational perturbation

theory analysis.

(This represents a hybrid approach in which a harmonic large basis

set coupled cluster calculation would be combined with a DFT anharmonic force ﬁeld.)

Comparing the results to Table IV, especially at low temperatures an improvement is

apparent. The initial error is reduced by a factor of two to three at room temperature.

For larger temperatures, this improvement becomes visibly smaller, with the entropy the

most aﬀected variable by the change. At 2000 K, it is the only function showing a lower

error than the one obtained by a pure DFT anharmonic force ﬁeld. For both the heat

capacity and the enthalpy, an error cancellation for DFT takes place, thus showing a lower

error for method (1) than method (4). Comparing the functionals, only PBE gives somewhat

worse results for this method. For the heat capacities and enthalpy at 298.15 and 600 K,

the accuracy of this method can already be compared to the anharmonic CCSD(T) results

obtained by method(3). The entropy, however will yield errors about four times as large at

298.15 K. This is of course the only method which yields a reasonable performance over the

full temperature range.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

In this validation study, we have calculated DFT anharmonic force ﬁelds for 17 small

(triatomic and larger) molecules.

At least using the present approach (ﬁnite diﬀerences of analytical Hessians), we ﬁnd

14

anharmonicities to be very sensitive to the DFT integration grid, with grids as large as

140

974 (ﬁrst row) and 200

974 (second row) being required for 1 cm−1 numerical precision

×

in fundamental frequencies.

The ﬁnite diﬀerence step sizes are another source of error. Either high-frequency or low-

frequency modes are mainly aﬀected, and too large or too small values will lead to large

errors. Various adaptive-stepsize approaches yield satisfactory results.

Basis sets of at least TZ2P quality appear to be called for, although DZP quality may be

an acceptable compromise for the very largest molecules.

HCTH/407 appears to be the most suitable GGA functional for the purpose, and B97-1

the most suitable hybrid functional, immediately followed by B3LYP. Somewhat surprisingly,

when combining DFT anharmonicities with large basis set CCSD(T) geometries and

harmonic frequencies, GGA functionals yield better results than their hybrid counterparts.

Fundamental frequencies can be determined to an accuracy of only 30 cm−1, which is

about the error that functionals also yield for harmonic frequencies. Of course, for organic

molecules, this error will be reduced and DFT might prove useful in helping experimentalists

in their assignments. For inorganic molecules, however, this accuracy might not be enough,

and a higher level method will have to be used to calculate the harmonic frequencies.

The same applies to zero-point energies. DFT zero-point energies alone might not be

accurate enough for using them as an addition to W2 or W3 theories, only in combination

with e.g. CCSD(T) harmonic frequencies their values will get the desired error estimations.

Since a full CCSD(T) force ﬁeld with a suﬃciently large basis set is so expensive, this might

be an attractive alternative in many cases.

DFT may be useful in computing vibrational corrections to rotational constants obtained

at higher levels of theory: the intrinsic errors in DFT rotational constants are large enough

that they outweigh any advantage gained by the anharmonic computation.

DFT anharmonic force ﬁelds are useful in obtaining thermodynamic functions at elevated

temperatures. At room temperature, the RRHO approximation is generally suﬃcient for

semirigid molecules.

Finally, DFT-computed anharmonic corrections to the zero-point vibrational energy will

somewhat enhance the reliability of high-level ab initio thermochemical data.

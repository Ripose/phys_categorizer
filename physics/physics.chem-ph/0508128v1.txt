The dispersion interaction between two point-like particles conﬁned in a dielectric slab between
two plates of another dielectric medium is studied within a continuum (Lifshitz) theory. The retarded
(Casimir-Polder) interaction at large inter-particle distances is found to be strongly enhanced as the
mismatch between the dielectric permittivities of the two media is increased. The large-distance
−3/2)/46 at zero temperature,
interaction is multiplied due to conﬁnement by a factor of (33γ5/2 +13γ
and by (5γ2 + γ−2)/6 at ﬁnite temperature, γ = ǫin(0)/ǫout(0) being the ratio between the static
dielectric permittivities of the inner and outer media. This conﬁnement-induced ampliﬁcation of
the dispersion interaction can reach several orders of magnitude.

The dispersion interaction acts between any two po-
larizable objects, thus being one of the most ubiquitous
interactions in nature [1, 2].
It plays a central role in
numerous phenomena in chemical physics and materials
science, including gas–liquid condensation, capillarity [3],
inter-surface interactions [4], and colloid stability [5].

The dispersion interaction is a quantum ﬂuctuation-
induced coupling between two polarizable particles me-
diated by the electromagnetic ﬁeld.
In an unconﬁned
system at zero temperature there is a single length scale
with which the inter-particle distance R is to be com-
pared, i.e., the characteristic wavelength λ0 of photon
absorption by the particles, typically in the ultravio-
London’s calculation [6], valid
let to visible range.
in the nonretarded limit R ≪ λ0, yields the poten-
0 dξα2(iξ)]R−6, where α(ω) is
tial U (R) = −[(3¯h/π)
the frequency-dependent polarizability of the particles.
Casimir and Polder [7] recast the problem in quantum-
electrodynamic terms, whereby the interaction arises
from the eﬀect of the particles on the zero-point modes
of the electromagnetic ﬁeld. For R ≪ λ0 the Casimir-
Polder result coincides with London’s, yet in the re-
tarded limit, R ≫ λ0, the interaction decays as R−7,
U (R) = −[(23/(4π))¯hcα2(0)]R−7 [8]. As a result, the
dispersion interaction between two particles in the re-
tarded regime (typically R > 0.1 µm) is extremely weak
and has not been directly observed. (Particle–surface and
surface–surface interactions across such micron-scale dis-
tances are much stronger and were successfully measured
in the 1990s [9, 10].) In the current Letter we demon-
strate that this weak particle–particle interaction can be
dramatically ampliﬁed in conﬁned geometries.

At a ﬁnite temperature T another length scale ap-
pears, i.e., the thermal wavelength λT = ¯hc/T ≃ 7.6
µm at room temperature. (The Boltzmann constant is
set hereafter to unity.) As was shown in Ref. [11], re-
tardation and ﬁnite-temperature eﬀects are intertwined.
For R ≫ λT , the interaction returns to a R−6 depen-

dence, the Helmholtz free energy of interaction being
F (R) = −3T α2(0)R−6.

The theory of dispersion interactions was extended by
Lifshitz et al. to the case where the interacting objects
as well as the intervening space are continuous media
[12, 13]. In this continuum theory the material response
to electromagnetic ﬁelds is assumed to be fully captured
by the complex, frequency-dependent dielectric permit-
tivity ǫ(ω) [14]. The current work is based on such a
continuum approach. Despite the strong underlying as-
sumption (after all, the media themselves consist of dis-
crete polarizable particles), the Lifshitz theory has been
widely used and experimentally corroborated [4].
It is
expected to yield valid results so long as the distance
between the two particles is much larger than the inter-
molecular distance in the materials.

In various circumstances particles are spatially con-
in porous media, micro-cavities, biological
ﬁned, e.g.,
constrictions or nanoﬂuidic devices. Such conﬁnement in-
troduces a new length scale, the separation h between the
bounding surfaces. The dispersion interaction between a
single particle and conﬁning surfaces has been extensively
studied in the context of cavity QED [9, 15]. The eﬀect
of conﬁnement on the interaction between two particles,
however, has been only partially addressed. Conﬁnement
by two metallic plates (i.e., the limit where the permit-
tivity of the outer medium ǫout → ∞) was found to dras-
tically aﬀect the interaction between two point-like parti-
cles in vacuum at zero [16] and nonzero [17] temperatures.
The nonretarded interaction between particles conﬁned
by two dielectric plates at T = 0 was addressed within a
single-image approximation in Ref. [18]. We extend the
theory of Refs. [16, 17] to the general and more practical
case of arbitrary permittivities of both inner and outer
media, discovering a dramatic enhancement for experi-
mentally relevant values of ǫin and ǫout.

The system under consideration is schematically shown
in Fig. 1. Two point-like, isotropic particles of polariz-

ability α(ω) are embedded in a slab of thickness h and
dielectric permittivity ǫin(ω). The slab is bounded by two
semi-inﬁnite media of dielectric permittivity ǫout(ω). We
use cylindrical coordinates, r = (ρ, ϕ, z), the ˆz axis taken
perpendicular to the bounding surfaces. For simplicity
we specialize to the symmetric case where the particles lie
on the slab midplane, z = h/2, connected by the vector
R = (R, 0, 0). All materials are assumed nonmagnetic.

We employ the semiclassical scheme introduced by Ma-
hanty and Ninham, which accurately reproduces the Lon-
don and Casimir-Polder results [19]. In this theory the

the prime indicating that the n = 0 term is multiplied by
1/2. In Eqs. (1) and (2) R = r − r′ and G(r, r′, ω) is the
dyadic Green tensor of the electric-ﬁeld wave equation,

∇ × ∇ × G − ǫm(ω)(ω2/c2)G = Iδ(r − r′

),

where I is the identity tensor and ǫm = ǫin or ǫout de-
pending on whether r lies in the inner or outer medium.
(The position r′ is taken inside the slab.) The boundary
conditions in the current case are continuity across the
bounding surfaces of the tangential components of both
the electric and magnetic ﬁelds. This imposes continuity
on ˆz × G and ˆz × ∇ × G across z = 0 and z = h.

Thus, this scheme reduces the problem to ﬁnding the
Green tensor G(r, r′, ω) of Eq. (3) with the aforemen-
tioned boundary conditions. The derivation is techni-
cally complicated and can be found in Refs. [20, 21].

and α(iξ), one can substitute Eq. (4) in Eq. (1) or (2)
and calculate numerically the interaction potential.

It is instructive, however, to ﬁrst analyze the inter-
action in several asymptotic limits. We begin with the
small-distance limit, recovering the known results for
unconﬁned particles. For R ≪ h the expressions for
gi are expanded to leading order in large v, where-
upon the integration in Eq. (4) can be carried out an-
alytically. Substituting the result in Eq. (1), we get

with the appropriate correction due to the fact that the

In the re-

by small (static) ξ. An asymptotic analysis then recovers

We now turn to the more interesting asymptotic limit
of large R where conﬁnement sets in. In the limit R ≫ h

Equation (10) gives the nonretarded interaction under
conﬁnement. It reduces to the London result, Eq. (5),
for γ = ǫin/ǫout = 1. This result has a rather restricted
validity as it requires that the conﬁnement length h be
much smaller than λ0. (A detailed discussion of the non-
retarded interaction under conﬁnement will be given in a
future publication.) In the retarded regime the integral
is dominated by small ξ, leading to

which extends Eq. (8) to the conﬁned geometry.

Equations (10) and (12) are our central results. They
account for the large-distance, retarded dispersion inter-
action between the conﬁned particles at zero and ﬁnite
temperature, respectively. Comparing with the uncon-
ﬁned results, Eqs. (6) and (8), we see that conﬁnement is
manifest as a factor dependent on the ratio γ(0) between

3

the static dielectric permittivities of the inner and outer
media. This factor can be very large [24]. For exam-
ple, for particles embedded in a polar liquid [ǫin(0) = 80]
which is conﬁned by glass plates [ǫout(0) = 4] at room
temperature, one gets an ampliﬁcation factor of about
300. If the outer medium is a gas (a free-standing ﬁlm,
ǫout = 1), the factor increases to about 5000 [25].

Finally, we present results from numerical integration
of Eqs. (2) and (4) for two speciﬁc examples of practi-
cal interest. The ﬁrst corresponds to two polystyrene
particles conﬁned in a slab of water between two glass
plates at room temperature. The dielectric permittiv-
ity ǫin(iξ) of water was taken from Ref. [2] and that
of silica glass, ǫout(iξ), from Ref. [26]. For α(iξ) we
took the excess Clausius-Mossotti polarizability [4] of a
polystyrene sphere, α(iξ)/Vs = [3ǫin(iξ)/(4π)][ǫPS(iξ) −
ǫin(iξ)]/[ǫPS(iξ) + 2ǫin(iξ)], Vs being the particle volume
and ǫPS(iξ) the permittivity of polystyrene, taken from
Ref. [2]. The resulting potentials for two interplate sep-
arations, h = 1 and 0.1 µm, are shown in Fig. 2(a) along
with the unconﬁned potential. The interaction per vol-
ume squared has been scaled by −T /R6. The curves,
therefore, represent the eﬀective Hamaker coeﬃcient (di-
vided by π2, in units of T ) as a function of inter-particle
distance. The unconﬁned potential clearly exhibits the
crossover from the nonretarded R−6 regime at small R to
the retarded R−7 dependence at intermediate distances,
and then back to the R−6 decay due to temperature. The
interaction under conﬁnement begins to signiﬁcantly de-
viate from the unconﬁned one at distances R >
∼ h. The
ampliﬁcation factor increases moderately with distance
until saturating to the asymptotic value given in Eq. (12).
In the second example we consider two polystyrene
particles conﬁned in a hydrocarbon slab of thickness
h = 3 nm, which is embedded in water. This may mimic
two small hydrophobic inclusions in a biological mem-
brane. For the oily environment we used the permittiv-
ity ǫin(iξ) of pentane [1]. As is seen in Fig. 2(b), the
ampliﬁcation becomes signiﬁcant only at R >
∼ 10h. This
is because for smaller distances retardation has not yet
set in. (Note the point of departure of the unconﬁned
potential from the nonretarded R−6 dependence.)

The conﬁnement-induced enhancement of the retarded
dispersion interaction can be viewed as a consequence
of multiple-reﬂection waveguiding of the electromagnetic
radiation between the boundaries. Despite the demon-
strated strong eﬀect the interaction remains weak.
In
the example presented in ﬁg. 2(a), for instance, the free
energy of interaction for h = 1 µm and R = 10 µm
is about 3 × 10−6 T /µm6. Nevertheless, to achieve the
same energy without conﬁnement one would have to set
the inter-particle distance at about 2 µm. Thus, besides
the fundamental signiﬁcance of the strong conﬁnement
eﬀect reported here for particle interactions in conﬁned
systems, it may become useful also in extending the range
of observation of the Casimir-Polder interaction.

A potential energy surface for the lowest quartet electronic state (4A′) of lithium trimer is devel-
oped and used to study spin-polarized Li + Li2 collisions at ultralow kinetic energies. The potential
energy surface allows barrierless atom exchange reactions. Elastic and inelastic cross sections are
calculated for collisions involving a variety of rovibrational states of Li2. Inelastic collisions are re-
sponsible for trap loss in molecule production experiments. Isotope eﬀects and the sensitivity of the
results to details of the potential energy surface are investigated. It is found that for vibrationally
excited states the cross sections are only quite weakly dependent on details of the potential energy
surface.

INTRODUCTION

There is great interest in the properties of molecules
formed in laser-cooled atomic gases by processes such
as photoassociation and magnetic association.1,2,3 Di-
atomic molecules have been formed from bosonic and/or
fermionic species of all the alkali metals from Li to Cs.
Dimers of bosonic species have usually been found to
decay quickly because of inelastic collisions with other
atoms,4,5,6,7 but for fermionic species (6Li, 40K) it has
been possible to stabilise the dimers by tuning to large
positive values of the atom-atom scattering length.8,9,10
This approach was used in late 2003 to create long-
lived Bose-Einstein condensates of fermion dimers,11,12,13
and since that time there has been a large amount of
work on their properties, and particularly on the transi-
tion between Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) and the
Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieﬀer (BCS) regime characterised
by long-range Cooper pairing and superﬂuidity.

Photoassociation and magnetic association (tuning
through zero-energy Feshbach resonances) both produce
molecules that are initially in very highly excited vibra-
tional states. However, there is great interest in bring-
ing these molecules down to low vibrational states and
ultimately to the absolute ground state. For example,
Staanum et al.14 have produced Cs2 in vibrational lev-
els v = 4 to 6 of the a3Σ+ state and studied collision
processes, while Sage et al.15 have produced small num-
bers of ultracold polar RbCs molecules in their absolute
ground state by a 4-photon process.

Ultracold molecules are initially formed in the pres-
ence of ultracold atoms and can collide with them.16 For
molecules in vibrationally excited states, there is the pos-
sibility of vibrationally inelastic collisions,

M2(v) + M −→ M2(v′ < v) + M,

(1)

where v is the vibrational quantum number. Since the
trap depth is usually much less than 1 K, such collisions
always release enough kinetic energy to eject both colli-
sion partners from the trap. If the molecular density is
high, there is also the possibility of inelastic molecule-
molecule collisions,

M2(v) + M2(v) −→ M2(v′ < v) + M2(v′′ ≤ v).

passage (STIRAP). They estimated an upper bound of
kloss = 8 × 10−11 cm3 s−1 due to inelastic atom-molecule
collisions. Mukaiyama et al.18 measured the trap loss
rate for 23Na2 molecules formed by Feshbach resonance
tuning and obtained an atom-molecule rate coeﬃcient
kloss = 5.1 × 10−11 cm3 s−1 for molecules in the highest
vibrational state. Staanum et al.14 investigated inelas-
tic collisions of rovibrationally excited Cs2 (3Σ+
u ) in
collisions with Cs atoms in two diﬀerent ranges of the
vibrational quantum number v by monitoring trap loss
of Cs2. They obtained atom-molecule rate coeﬃcients
close to 1.0 × 10−10 cm3 s−1 for both v = 4 to 6 and
v = 32 to 47. Zahzam et al.19 carried out similar work
for diﬀerent rovibrational states of 3Σ+
u , and also consid-
ered molecules in the 1Σ+
g state and molecule-molecule
collisions. They obtained rate coeﬃcients of 2.6 × 10−11

cm3 s−1 and 1.0 × 10−11 cm3 s−1 in the atom-atom and
atom-molecule cases respectively, both with quite large
error bounds.

Quantum dynamics calculations on alkali metal atom–
diatom collisions were ﬁrst carried out by Sold´an et al.,20
using the potential energy surface of Higgins et al.27 and
subsequently extended to K + K2 on a new potential
surface.24 In parallel work, Petrov et al.22,23 analysed
the stability of fermion dimers in terms of the long-range
form of the wavefunction. In the case where the atom-
atom scattering length a is much larger than the range
of the atom-atom potential re, they showed that both
atom-molecule and molecule-molecule inelastic collision
rates are suppressed by Fermi statistics. However, their
derivation applies only to molecules that are in long-
range states, with a wavefunction that depends on the
atom-atom scattering length a, with χ(r) ∼ exp(−r/a).
In the present paper, we show computationally that there
is no systematic suppression of the atom-molecule inelas-
tic rate for 6Li dimers in low-lying vibrational levels, even
when a is large and positive. We also consider mixed-
isotope Li + Li2 collisions. This has been reported brieﬂy
in previous work,25,26 but the present paper gives full de-
tails of the calculations and further details of the results.
The structure of the paper is as follows. Section II
describes calculations of the potential energy surface for
quartet Li3, including details of both the electronic struc-
ture methods employed and the procedures used to in-
terpolate between and extrapolate beyond the ab initio
points. The surface allows barrierless atom exchange
reactions. Section III describes atom + diatom reac-
tive scattering calculations both for homonuclear sys-
tems [bosonic, 7Li + 7Li2 and fermionic, 6Li + 6Li2]
and mixed-isotope systems. For collisions of 7Li with
either 6Li2 or 6Li7Li, exoergic atom exchange reactions
are possible even for ground-state molecules because of
the diﬀerences in zero-point energies. Section III also ex-
plores the sensitivity of the cross sections to the potential
energy surface and shows that for vibrationally excited
states the dependence is relatively weak (only a factor of
2 for molecules initially in v = 3). Section IV presents
conclusions and prospects for future work.

II. QUARTET POTENTIAL ENERGY
SURFACES FOR LI3

In previous work, we investigated nonadditive forces
in spin-polarized (quartet) alkali metal trimers28 at lin-
ear and equilateral geometries. For Li3, we found very
large nonadditive forces at equilateral geometries that
reduced the interatomic distance by more than 1 ˚A and
increased the well depth by a factor of 4 with respect
to the sum of Li–Li pair potentials. We subsequently
gave a brief description of the complete potential energy
surface25 and identiﬁed a seam of conical intersections at
collinear geometries between 4Σ and 4Π states. The con-
ical intersection has been investigated further by Brue et

2

al.29 The seam results in a cusp at energies close to the
atom-diatom threshold and inﬂuences Li + Li2 collision
dynamics at ultralow energies.25,26 In the present paper,
we give a full description of the ab initio calculations and
ﬁtting procedure used to obtain a global representation
of the surface and extend the collision calculations.

A. Electronic states overview

In the present work, we are interested mostly in the
lowest quartet electronic state of Li3, which is a 4A′
state in Cs symmetry. This state correlates with three
ground-state (2S) atoms at large interatomic separations.
As mentioned above, the quartet ground state has cross-
ings with other electronic states that correlate with the
S + S + P separated-atom limit. These crossings (and
avoided crossings) occur at energies that are potentially
relevant to scattering processes involving three ground-
state Li atoms. To gain a broader, qualitative picture on
how the diﬀerent potential energy surfaces intertwine,
we have carried out state-averaged multiconﬁguration
self-consistent ﬁeld (MCSCF) calculations of the poten-
tial energy surfaces of quartet states for certain high-
symmetry arrangements. These calculations used the
complete active space (CASSCF) method of Werner and
Knowles,30,31,32,33,34 as implemented in the MOLPRO
package,35 with an aug-cc-pVTZ basis set generated from
the cc-pVTZ set36 as described below. The active space
included all 24 molecular orbitals constructed principally
from 2s, 2p, 3s and 3p atomic orbitals, with the three 1s
orbitals doubly occupied in all conﬁgurations; this active
space is designated [3,24] below.

Figure 1 shows the potential curves obtained for quar-
tet states at D∞h geometries. The ground state is of Σu
symmetry; at a Li-Li bond length r near 3 ˚A it intersects
a Πg state, which in turn intersects a Σg state at higher
energies.
If we change the interbond angle α, keeping
the two adjacent bond lengths unchanged (moving from
D∞h to C2v arrangements), the ground state becomes
of B2 symmetry, while the Πg state splits into states of
A2 and B2 symmetries. The two B2 states avoided-cross
around α = 70◦. At D3h arrangements (α = 60◦), shown
in Figure 2, the ground state is of A′
2 symmetry, while
the second B2 state forms a doubly degenerate E′ state
with the A1 state that originated from Σg at D∞h. The
A2 state in C2v symmetry (Πg = A2 + B2) forms an E′′
state with the B1 state that was a part of Πu = A1 + B1
at D∞h.

For comparison, Figure 3 shows the triplet states of
Li2 calculated using [2,8]-CASSCF, followed by an inter-
nally contracted multireference conﬁguration interaction
(MRCI)34,37,38,39 including single and double excitations
from the CASSCF wavefunction.

Figure 4 shows a correlation diagram that connects
the D∞h, D3h and atom-diatom (C2v) limits for states
of quartet Li3 that correlate with the S + S + P atomic
limit for ﬁxed bond length of 6 ˚A. Note that the molecular

Dunning-type cc-pVXZ bases in order to give a better
account of the core-core and core-valence correlation.
There are no standard augmented basis sets available
for Li,36 so we generated augmented variants of several
basis sets using the even-tempered scheme implemented
in MOLPRO, which adds an additional diﬀuse function
of each angular symmetry (s, p, d, f, ...), with an even-
tempered exponent based on the ratio of the two smallest
exponents in the original set (or a ratio of 2.5 if only one

state arising from three S-state atoms is not shown.

In the present work we focus on calculating the lowest
quartet state, 4A′, to high precision. Colavecchia et al.40
and Brue et al.29 have carried out full conﬁguration inter-
action (FCI) calculations with just one electron on each
Li atom correlated. Our calculations diﬀer from theirs in
correlating all electrons and in using considerably larger
basis sets, but use approximate correlation treatments.

B. Basis set convergence

A variety of basis sets are available for lithium. Feller36
constructed correlation-consistent polarized valence ba-
sis sets (cc-pVXZ for X=D, T, Q, and 5)41 and Iron et
al.42 devised correlation-consistent polarized core-valence

function of a type is present in the original basis).

The cc-pVXZ and cc-pCVXZ basis sets are usually
used with the s and p functions contracted. However,
in previous work on alkali metal trimers,28 we found it
advantageous to use the basis sets in uncontracted form.
In the present work we consider the cc-pV5Z basis set in
fully contracted (sp-contracted),
three diﬀerent forms:
fully uncontracted, and with just the p space uncon-
tracted (s-contracted). However, we found it too expen-
sive to uncontract the cc-pCVXZ and augmented basis
sets and these were used in fully contracted form.

We chose to use RCCSD(T) calculations (restricted
open-shell coupled cluster with single, double and nonit-
erative triple excitations). All calculations were carried
out using MOLPRO.35

With the computer resources available to us, we found
that RCCSD(T) calculations of triatomic energies with
the largest basis sets available, cc-pCV5Z and aug-cc-
pCV5Z, were feasible only for relatively small numbers
of points, not for a grid of several hundred points. These
basis sets were therefore used only for atomic and di-
atomic calculations, except that the cc-pCV5Z basis set
was used to provide benchmark triatomic calculations at
a restricted number of points.

We began by testing convergence of two atomic prop-
erties, the static polarizability and the S–P excitation
energy, which are important for accurate calculations of
long-range forces. The results for a variety of basis are
In general terms all the basis sets
shown in Table I.
perform acceptably for both quantities, though the s-
contracted cc-pV5Z basis set is fortuitously accurate for
the S–P excitation energy.

We next considered the performance of diﬀerent basis
sets on potential curves for the 3Σ+
u state of Li2. Elec-
tronic energies were calculated on a mesh of 64 inter-
atomic distances. The results were corrected for basis-
set superposition error (BSSE) using the counterpoise
correction.46 The points were then interpolated using the
reciprocal power reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RP-
RKHS) interpolation method47,48 with dispersion coef-
ﬁcients C6, C8 and C10 ﬁxed to accurate values from
the calculations of Yan et al.49 At internuclear distances
r > 16 ˚A the ab initio energies were replaced by those
from the three-term dispersion formula. Other interpola-
tion parameters, in the notation of Ref. 48, were m = 2,
n = 3, ra = 15 ˚A, r65 = 21.5 ˚A, r66 = 22.5 ˚A, r67 = 23.5
˚A.

The resulting diatomic well depth De and bond length
re are included in Table I, together with the binding en-
ergy of the last bound state E10 and scattering length a
calculated for 7Li2. The results are compared with prop-
erties obtained from the RKR curves of Linton et al.50
(the values of a and E10 are from photoassociation spec-
troscopy in combination with RKR results51).
It may
be seen that all the basis sets underestimate the RKR
well depth by between 2 and 5 cm−1, except for the cc-
pCVQZ basis set which underestimates it by 8 cm−1 and
the sp-contracted cc-pV5Z basis set which slightly over-

4

estimates it. On this basis we excluded the cc-pCVQZ
basis set from further consideration.

Another way to test the quality of a basis set is to con-
sider the magnitude of BSSE. BSSE arises when basis
functions on two centers overlap and compensate for in-
adequacies in the one-centre basis. Table I shows dimer
BSSE values at r = 4.2 ˚A, which is near the potential
minimum. The cc-pCVXZ basis sets give quite small
BSSE values since they are by construction geared to
represent the core-core correlation well. However, as dis-
cussed above, the cc-pCVQZ basis set is not accurate
enough for our purposes and the cc-pCV5Z basis set is
too expensive. We therefore focussed on the cc-pV5Z ba-
sis sets. As may be seen in Table I, the cc-pV5Z basis
set in sp-contracted form gives a very large BSSE, 41.45
cm−1 at r = 4.2 ˚A, which we considered unacceptably
high. However, uncontracting the p space reduces this to
2.553 cm−1. Uncontracting the s space as well reduces
this by a further factor of 3, but at a very considerable
computational cost.

Finally, we carried out convergence tests on triatomic
energies. In this case there are no experimental results to
compare with, so we used the position and energy of the
equilateral minimum, calculated with the cc-pCV5Z basis
set, as our benchmark. As may be seen in Table I, there is
very little diﬀerence between the s-contracted and uncon-
tracted forms of the cc-pV5Z basis set, which underesti-
mate the cc-pCV5Z well depth by 11 and 13 cm−1 respec-
tively. However, the sp-contracted form overestimates
the well depth by 40 cm−1. For triatomic RCCSD(T) cal-
culations the s-contracted basis set costs only 10% more
than the sp-contracted set, which the fully uncontracted
set costs twice as much. On this basis we decided to pro-
ceed with the s-contracted cc-pV5Z basis set to calculate
the full potential surface.

One further possibility we considered was the use of
frozen-core calculations, which are considerably cheaper
than calculations that correlate all electrons. However,
we found that such calculations systematically overesti-
mate dimer well depths by 2 to 3% and equilibrium dis-
tances by about 2% compared to cc-pCVXZ calculations
at each level (T, Q, Z). For example, frozen-core cal-
culations with the sp-contracted cc-pV5Z basis set give
De = 338.471 cm−1 and re = 4.199 ˚A for Li2. Frozen-
core calculations on the trimer with this basis set un-
derestimate the trimer well depth, giving De = 3937.5
cm−1 and re = 3.137 ˚A. We therefore did not pursue the
frozen-core approximation.

As described above, the Li3 potential shows a seam

RCCSD(T) approach is inherently a single-reference
method, so its appropriateness in the vicinity of a conical
intersection is open to question. The usual approach is to
consider the T1 diagnostic, which can be used to identify
where multireference eﬀects become large and may com-
promise the results. Lee and Taylor52 have given a rule of
thumb that single-reference methods become unreliable
when T1 > 0.02. In the present calculations, the T1 diag-

nostic was relatively small at near-linear geometries but
had a maximum value of around 0.11 at equilateral ge-
ometries. We therefore investigated the reliability of the
RCCSD(T) approach by recalculated the Li3 potential
energy surface with a smaller basis set (aug-cc-pVTZ),
using [3,12]-CASSCF followed by a multireference conﬁg-
uration interaction (MRCI) calculation including David-
son’s correction, and compared it with the corresponding
RCCSD(T) energies. The T1 diagnostic was again large
in the well region for bond angles of ∼ 60◦. Nevertheless,
the two surfaces agreed within 2% in well depth with no
visible qualitative diﬀerences. We therefore believe that
the RCCSD(T) energies obtained with the cc-pV5Z basis
set are trustworthy.

C. The 14A′ surface

1. Representation of the surface

If the potential is to be capable of representing all the
properties of experimental interest (including atom-atom
scattering lengths, dimer and trimer bound states, atom-
diatom collisions and 3-body recombination), then it is
very important that it should represent dissociation into
all possible sets of products (atom + diatom and 3 sep-
arated atoms) with the correct long-range behaviour. In
our previous work on K + K2,24 this was achieved by
separating the potential into pairwise-additive and non-
additive parts and interpolating them separately,

V (r) =

Vdimer(rij ) + V3(r),

(3)

3

Xi<j

where r represents (r12, r23, r31) and the functional form
for the nonadditive part V3(r) is chosen to ensure the
correct behaviour in the atom-diatom limit.53 However,
for Li + Li2 the non-additive term is so large that the

potential minimum for the trimer occurs at a distance
that is high on the repulsive wall for the dimer. Because
of this, Eq. (3) would represent the interaction poten-
tial in this region as a diﬀerence between two very large
quantities. This is unsatisfactory. Nevertheless, at long
range a decomposition according to Eq. (3) is essential.
Under these circumstances, it is best to ﬁt the ab initio
points directly to obtain a short-range function VSR(r)
without imposing the correct long-range behaviour, and
to join this onto a potential with the proper long-range
behaviour VLR(r) using a switching function S(r),

V (r) = S(r)VSR(r) + [1 − S(r)]VLR(r).
The switching function is 1 at short range but switches
smoothly to zero at long range as described below.

(4)

2. Choice of grid

For quantum dynamics calculations, it is very impor-
tant to represent the potential energy function smoothly
and without oscillations between ab initio points. There
are several coordinate systems that can be used for tri-
atomic systems,
including hyperspherical coordinates,
Jacobi coordinates, valence (bond length / bond angle)
coordinates and pure bond-length coordinates. These are
by no means equivalent for interpolation purposes. As
will be seen below, the dynamical calculations are car-
ried out in hyperspherical coordinates. However, grids
of points in hyperspherical coordinates tend to include
points in which 2 atoms lie very close together, which
hinders interpolation because polynomials with very high
localised maxima tend to have oscillations in other re-
gions. Jacobi coordinates suﬀer from the same problem,
and neither Jacobi coordinates nor valence coordinates
allow the full 3-body exchange symmetry to be intro-
duced in a natural way. Fortunately, there is no need to
represent the potential energy surface in the same coordi-
nate system as is used in the dynamical calculations. We

therefore chose to carry out electronic structure calcula-
tions on a grid of points in pure bond-length coordinates
(r12, r23, r31), which make exchange symmetry easy to
handle but avoid points with atoms too close together.

The grid was constructed using the internuclear dis-
tances r = 2.0, 2.4, 2.8, 3.2, 3.6, 4.0, 4.4, 4.8, 5.2, 6.0,
6.8, 8.4 and 10.0 ˚A. At nonlinear geometries, the grid in-
cluded all 315 unique combinations of (r12, r23 and r31)
taken from this set that satisfy the triangle inequality,
r31 < r12 + r23. We also added additional points for
which r12 and r23 are in this set and r31 takes values
larger than 10.0 ˚A in steps of 1.6 ˚A. This produced an-
other 56 points, such as, for example, (6.0, 6.0, 11.6) ˚A.
A grid of 120 linear conﬁgurations (r31 = r12 + r23) was
formed by taking all possible combinations of r12 and r23
from the above set with the additional distance 5.6 ˚A. We
calculated electronic energies at a total of 491 geometries.
Interaction energies for the 4A′ state were calculated
with respect to the 3-atom S + S + S dissociation limit
using RCCSD(T) calculations with the s-contracted cc-
pV5Z basis set described above. All
interaction en-
ergies were corrected for BSSE using the counterpoise
correction.46

3. Fitting and interpolation

Even with almost 500 points, the grid is fairly sparse
and the quality of interpolation is important. However,
many interpolation procedures in N dimensions work
only for a “product” grid, in which points are available at
all combinations of a set of coordinate values. This can-
not be provided in pure bond length coordinates because
of the need to satisfy the triangle condition. We therefore
chose to use the interpolant-moving least squares (IMLS)
method.54 In this approach, approximate gradients and
Hessians are calculated at each grid point and stored.
The ﬁtting function is represented as a weighted sum of
Taylor expansions of second order about the grid points.
The IMLS procedure has two parameters, the power p
that determines the shape and range of the weight func-
tion and a smoothing parameter ǫ that removes the ﬂat
spots at data points. Figure 5 shows IMLS ﬁts to the
potential for D∞h geometries in the region of the conical
intersection, with p = 6 and ǫ values of 0.03 and 0.05 ˚A.
The grid points and the surface of Colavecchia et al.40 are
also shown for comparison. The value of ǫ used here is
large in comparison with previous applications54,55,56,57
and produces a root-mean-square error of 9.72 cm−1.
The relative error was larger than 1% at 67 geometries,
21 of which lie below the 3-body dissociation limit and
are enclosed by 0.5 contour of the switching function (see
Eq. (7) below). There are only 5 geometries at which the
relative error is larger than 10%, and these lie either near
the conical intersection or near the zero of the potential
(where the relative error does not reﬂect the accuracy).

4. The long-range potential

The long-range potential, VLR(r), was constructed as
a sum of pairwise potentials and a nonadditive part as in
Eq. (3). The need to include the nonadditive term has
been described in detail in ref. 53. In particular, the sum
of pair potentials gives an isotropic atom-diatom C6 coef-
ﬁcient, whereas in reality there are important anisotropic
terms. For the pairwise potentials Vdimer(r) we used the
Li2 RKR potential of Linton et al.,50 which extrapolates
to a three-term dispersion expression with coeﬃcients C6,
C8 and C10 as given by Yan et al.49 The nonadditive po-
tential was constructed as described in ref.53 from the
Axilrod-Teller-Muto triple-dipole term,58,59 the third-
order dipole-dipole-quadrupole dispersion energy,60,61
the fourth-order dipole dispersion energy,62,63 and an
atom-diatom term that is short-range in one of the three
distances,53

III. LI + LI2 SCATTERING CALCULATIONS

A. Methodology

Both linear and equilateral conﬁgurations of the Li3
collision complex (and all geometries in between) lie lower
in energy than Li + Li2. The potential energy sur-
face thus allows barrierless atom exchange (rearrange-
ment) collisions even at limitingly low collision ener-
gies. Calculations using an inelastic formalism (includ-
ing only one arrangement channel) are therefore inade-
quate. Accordingly, we have carried out quantum reac-
tive scattering calculations to obtain collision cross sec-
tions. The methodology has been described in our pre-
20,21 and
vious work on ultracold collisions in Na + Na2
24 and also in studies of insertion reactions such
K + K2
as N(2D) + H2 → NH + H,67 O(1D) + H2 → OH + H68,69
and S(2D) + H2 → SH + H70 at thermal energies.

The time-independent Schr¨odinger equation is solved
using a coupled-channel method in body-ﬁxed demo-
cratic hyperspherical coordinates71 using a diabatic-by-

sector method. In each sector, the wavefunction is ex-
panded in the eigenstates of a reference hamiltonian
at a ﬁxed hyperradius. The reference hamiltonian in-
cludes potential energy terms and kinetic energy terms
arising from deformation and rotation around the axis
of least moment of inertia.
Its eigenfunctions are ob-
tained by variational expansion in a set of pseudohy-
perspherical harmonics. The resulting coupled equa-

tions are integrated using the log-derivative method of
Manolopoulos.72 At the point where interchannel cou-
plings are small enough to be neglected, the coupled-
channel solutions are matched onto atom-diatom func-
tions propagated inwards in Jacobi coordinates to take
account of the isotropic long-range and centrifugal po-
tentials.

The diatom wavefunctions for Hund’s case (b), which is
appropriate for Li2 (3Σ+
u ), are labeled with a vibrational
quantum number v and a mechanical rotational quantum
number n; n couples with the diatomic electron spin s =
1 to give a resultant j. However, for Li2 the splitting
between states of the same n but diﬀerent j are very
small. We therefore do not introduce the spin explicitly
and n and j are equivalent in our calculations.

The matching procedure yields the reactance matrix
K, the scattering matrix S and the transition matrix
T = I − S, where I is a unit matrix. The diﬀerential
cross sections, averaged over initial mn and summed over
ﬁnal m′

n states, are given by

angular momentum. In the presence of a long-range po-
tential −Csr−s, elastic cross sections have an additional
term ∼ Es−3 that dominates for higher l at ultralow en-
ergies.

B. Computational details

We have performed coupled-channel calculations on all
possible mixtures of the two isotopes of lithium, 7Li and
6Li. The 7Li nucleus is a fermion with nuclear spin 3/2,
so that the atom, including its electrons, behaves as a
composite boson in cold dilute gases. The 6Li nucleus is
a boson with nuclear spin 1, while the atom is a com-
posite fermion. The present calculations are restricted
to collisions in which all three of the atoms are in spin-
stretched states (with F = I + S = Fmax and |MF | = F ).
For these states the nuclear spin wavefunction is symmet-
ric with respect to any exchange of nuclei. However, the
electronic wavefunction for the quartet state, which de-
pends parametrically on nuclear coordinates, is antisym-
metric with respect to exchange of two identical nuclei.
This means that the spatial nuclear wavefunction must
be symmetric under exchange of any two fermionic nu-
clei (bosonic alkali metal atoms) and antisymmetric un-
der exchange of any two bosonic nuclei (fermionic alkali
metal atoms). The symmetry under exchange of identical
nuclei is easy to impose in our program by selecting pseu-
dohyperspherical harmonics of appropriate symmetry in
the basis set.

Propagation of the coupled-channel solutions is per-
formed separately for each partial wave J Π, labeled by
the spin-free total angular momentum J, and parity
eigenvalue Π. The parity is (−1)n+l, and only l values

that satisfy the triangle inequality, |J − n| ≤ l ≤ J + n,
are permitted.

The basis set for 7Li3 included all eigenstates of the
reference hamiltonian (see above) that match onto 7Li2
states below the v = 7 manifold. Only even values of n
are allowed for 7Li2 in spin-stretched states. The result-
ing number of coupled equations varied between 97, for
total angular momentum J = 0, and 827, for J = 10. For
the 6Li3 system, including only odd-n states of 6Li2 be-
low the v = 7 manifold gave a basis set that varied in size
between 85 for J = 0 and 782 for J = 11−. For 6Li7Li2
and 7Li6Li2, where the symmetry is reduced, the basis
set even for J = 0 consisted of 272 and 263 functions, re-
spectively. The calculation of eigenstates of the reference
hamiltonian involved diagonalizations of matrices of sizes
between 1240 and 2136 for 7Li3, between 1220 and 2162
for 6Li3, and between 3660 and 6488 for the isotopically
mixed systems.

The coupled equations were integrated across a range
of hyperradius ρ between 5 a0 and 45 a0 with a log-
derivative sector width of 0.1 a0. Within each sector,
the wavefunction is propagated using the log-derivative
method of Manolopoulos,72 with a step size keyed to
the local de Broglie wavelength. The propagation in
the outer region in Jacobi coordinates extended as far
as R = 10000 a0 for collision energies of E = 1 nK.

C. Ultracold collisions

In the ultracold regime, the dominant contribution to
cross sections comes from the partial wave that includes
the l = 0 channel (s-wave scattering). For a particular
initial rovibrational state (v, n), the cross section is thus
calculated from the partial wave labeled by the total an-
gular momentum J = n and parity Π = (−1)n. Figures
9 and 10 show the J = 0 cross sections for 7Li + 7Li2 for
initial states (v, n) = (0, 0) and (1, 0). The insets show
the real and imaginary part of the complex scattering
length, calculated using Eq. (12).

The energy dependence is particularly simple for col-
lisions involving a ground-state 7Li2 molecule, (v, n) =
(0, 0). Only elastic scattering is allowed below 2.3 K (the
energy of the (0, 2) threshold). The elastic cross sections
are essentially constant below ∼ 10−5 K, and oscillate
at higher energies. They exhibit sudden drops to zero
at 37 mK and 300 mK and a feature around 750 mK.
The one-channel scattering is characterized by a phase
shift δ that can be extracted from the 1 × 1 K matrix
element, K11 = tan δ.75 The energy dependence of the
phase shift is shown in Figure 11, and the zeroes in the
cross section can be associated with δ passing through
a multiple of π. The proﬁle of the cross section follows
∼ sin2 δ and the associated minima are sometimes known
as Ramsauer-Townsend minima.

The feature at ∼ 750 mK is diﬀerent.

It is associ-
ated with a sharp rise in δ through π, superimposed on
the falling background. This is characteristic of a scat-

tering resonance, and in this case is due to a Feshbach
resonance involving a quasibound state associated with
a rotationally excited threshold.

For the vibrationally excited initial state (v, n) = (1, 0)
the above arguments generalize. The S-matrix is now
an 9 × 9 matrix with 8 inelastic (or reactive) channels
corresponding to v = 0, n = 0, 2, . . . 14. The elastic
cross sections, Figure 12, still show oscillations, but these
do not reach zero because the elastic S-matrix element
cannot be 1 in the presence of inelastic scattering. The
quantity that now shows a rise of π across a resonance is
the eigenphase sum, which is the sum of phases obtained
from eigenvalues of the K (or S) matrix. The eigenphase
sum and the individual eigenphases are shown in Figure
13. It may be seen that there are two broad resonances
centered at about 0.5 K and 0.8 K, but that the phase
change associated with them is spread between all the

pattern with many avoided crossings.

The inelastic cross sections show a slope of −1/2 on
a log-log scale at ultralow temperatures, as predicted by
the Wigner threshold law, Eq. (16). Above about 10−2
K, the slope changes to −1. The total inelastic prob-
ability, shown in Figure 12, increases with collision en-
ergy according to the Wigner laws and saturates close
to unity outside the Wigner region.20 At this point the
energy dependence of the cross sections is governed by
the kinematic prefactor 1/k2 in Eq. (11). A high inelas-
tic probability is a feature of reactions proceeding over a
deep well.20,24,67,68,69,70

oscillation is thought to be due to a rotational rainbow
eﬀect.76 In classical terms, the angular momentum im-
parted to the Li2 molecule is zero if the kinetic energy
is released at linear or T-shaped geometries, but large at
around θ = 45◦. In this model, the oscillations arise from
interference between classical trajectories on either side
of the maximum.

The relative rotational distributions do not change sig-
niﬁcantly across the Wigner regime, although individual
cross sections vary over ﬁve orders of magnitude between
1 nK and 100 mK because of the k−1 dependence of the
Wigner threshold laws.

We have studied collisions involving a range of diﬀerent
initial molecular states. Results at a collision energy of
∼ 1 nK are presented in Table II. There is no systematic
dependence of the cross sections on the initial molecular
state. Instead, the cross sections show essentially random
scatter about a mean value. The origin of this behavior
is discussed below. At 1 nK, the inelastic cross sections
are typically three orders of magnitude higher than the
elastic cross sections. The ratio decreases with the colli-
sion energy according to the Wigner laws, Eq. (16), until
it reaches ∼ 1 in the millikelvin range. Sympathetic and
evaporative cooling of atoms and molecules depend on
a low value (< 10−2) of this ratio, so it is unlikely that
such cooling mechanisms will be possible for alkali metal
dimers in low-lying vibrationally excited states.

FIG. 14: Final rotational distributions for 7Li + 7Li2(vi =
1, ni = 0) at 0.928 nK.

It has previously been found that collisions involving
rotationally excited diatoms can cause unusually eﬃcient
and speciﬁc energy transfer when the collision time is
longer than the rotational period.77,78 This has been ex-
plained in terms of adiabatic invariance theory79 with
the assumption that the coupling between the degrees of
freedom is not strong. This quasiresonant behaviour has
also been studied at ultralow temperatures.80,81,82,83 In-
elastic transitions in some highly excited rotational levels
of hydrogen molecules were found to be dramatically sup-
pressed. We observe no evidence of such quasiresonant
behaviour in Li + Li2 collisions. Pure rotational tran-
sitions are as eﬃcient as other rovibrational transitions
in this strong-coupling case. The ﬁnal-state rotational
distributions tend to favor higher n levels for collisions of
molecules in highly excited rotational levels, as in statis-
tical models.

The atom-molecule inelastic loss rates observed in ex-
periments on ultracold boson dimers (133Cs2),14,19 are
around 10−10 cm3 s−1, which is consistent with the cross
sections obtained here for the bosonic lithium dimer
(7Li2).

D. Cold collisions

At millikelvin collision energies, partial waves with
end-over-end angular momentum l > 0 contribute sig-
niﬁcantly to the overall cross sections. The convergence
of the elastic and inelastic probabilities σk2/π with total
angular momentum J is shown in Figures 15 and 16 for
collisions with molecules in the (1, 0) initial state. Par-
tial waves J = 0 to 10 suﬃce to converge cross sections
up to ∼ 580 mK, where the contribution of J = 10 to
elastic and inelastic cross sections is 2.35% and 0.0655%,
respectively. It may be seen that, for each energy, the
inelastic cross sections are close to 1 for partial waves up
to an energy-dependent cutoﬀ value. The corresponding

TABLE II: Elastic and total inelastic cross sections and rate
coeﬃcients for 7Li + 7Li2(vi, ni) at a collision energy of 0.928
nK for diﬀerent initial states of the molecule.

elastic cross sections oscillate around 1 until the cutoﬀ is
reached. Above 100 mK, convergence is slower for elastic
probabilities, while below that it is slower for inelastic
probabilities.

The cross sections for partial waves with J > 0 also
show a simple energy dependence. In the Wigner regime
the inelastic cross sections increase with slope l − 1/2 on
a log-log scale, with l = J for ni = 0. At energies above
the centrifugal barrier they decrease with slope −1.

When several partial waves contribute signiﬁcantly to
the cross sections, the inelastic cross sections can be de-
scribed semiquantitatively by classical Langevin capture
theory. The assumption underlying this model is that
the only condition for an inelastic event to take place
is for the projectile to surmount the barrier of the eﬀec-
tive potential resulting from the repulsive centrifugal and
attractive long-range potential. For a long-range interac-
tion of the form −Cs/R−s the eﬀective potential is

The total inelastic cross sections are compared with this
result in Figure 17 and it may be seen that there is in-
creasingly good agreement between the full calculations
and the Langevin model above about 30 mK.

To test that the agreement between the Langevin
model and our results is not fortuitous, we recalculated
the cross sections using partial waves J = 0 to 10 us-
ing a diﬀerent potential surface, designated ACVTZ. The
ACVTZ potential was obtained in the same manner as
described above, but with electronic energies calculated
using a considerably smaller basis set (aug-cc-pCVTZ).
The potential is signiﬁcantly diﬀerent, with a global D3h
minimum 3873.37 cm−1 deep at r = 3.125 ˚A and a D∞h
minimum 930.29 cm−1 deep at r = 3.780 ˚A. The two po-
tentials have the same long-range form, joined using the
switching function of Eq. (7). The elastic and inelastic
cross sections calculated using the ACVTZ potential are
included in Figure 17. Once again the agreement with
the Langevin model is excellent above ∼ 30 mK, though
the two potentials give cross sections that diﬀer by about
an order of magnitude in the Wigner regime. We found
similar agreement with the model for collisions involving
other initial molecular states. The Langevin cross sec-
tions are independent of the initial state, particle masses
and the details of short-range potential.

Elastic cross sections are comparable to inelastic ones
in the millikelvin region and can be as high as twice the
inelastic ones. However, the ratio is never high enough to
be favorable for the prospects of evaporative or sympa-
thetic cooling. Whenever the Langevin model provides
good estimates of inelastic cross sections, it implies that
the inelastic probabilities are close to 1, which in turn
implies that elastic cross sections (Eq. (10)) and inelastic
cross sections (Eq. (11)) are not drastically diﬀerent.

The reaction 7Li + 7Li2 has no barrier for either lin-
ear or perpendicular approaches. The deep well in the

potential energy surface suggests that the reaction pro-
ceeds via an insertion mechanism involving complex for-
mation. It is therefore interesting to compare the scat-
tering results obtained here with those for insertion re-
actions that have been studied at ordinary temperatures
(∼ 100 meV).67,68,69,70 These reactions are also charac-
terized by high inelastic and reactive probabilities. The
ﬁnal-state vibrational distributions decrease with v and
the rotational distributions peak at high n for each ﬁnal
v. If all product states are equally probable, the product
state distribution is proportional to the density of avail-
able states, which depends on the rotational degeneracy
and the density of translational states. The resulting
diﬀerential cross sections display forward-backward sym-
metry. This can be explained by formation of a collision
complex whose decay is statistical.84 It has been shown
that the exact quantum scattering results for insertion
reactions are in excellent agreement with results based
on a quantum statistical theory at thermal energies.85

The success of the Langevin model for total inelastic
cross sections makes it worthwhile to investigate whether
the product state distributions are well described by sta-
tistical theory. The statistical prior distributions are
given by

pvn ∼ (2n + 1)

E − Evn,

(21)

p

where v and n refer to the ﬁnal states and E is the total
energy in the system.

Figure 18 compares the statistical predictions with full
dynamics results in both the ultracold regime and at 580
mK for 7Li + 7Li2 collisions for initial (v, n) = (3, 0). The
ultracold results are quite diﬀerent from the statistical
predictions and show oscillations with n for each v simi-
lar to those in Fig. 14. However, the oscillations start to
wash out at higher energies and the rotational distribu-
tions start to resemble the statistical ones, though they
still favor low rotational quantum numbers. The vibra-
tional distributions are clearly some way from statistical
even at 580 mK and favor high v (smaller changes in
vibrational quantum number).

The corresponding results for diﬀerential cross sections
are shown in Fig. 19. Statistical theory predicts forward-
backward symmetry, but this has not fully developed
even at 580 mK. Similar results have been obtained in
the study of cold collisions of K + K2.24 The asymmetry
probably arises from insuﬃcient averaging over J in Eq.
(8) at cold collision energies. We expect that at higher
collision energies, where more partial waves contribute,
the cross terms in Eq. (8) will vanish due to phase can-
cellations and the symmetry observed in other deep-well
systems will be recovered.

is very sensitive to details of the interaction potential
and its properties and dependence on potential are well
established.86 In particular, the scattering length passes
through a pole whenever there is a bound state of the
diatomic potential curve at exactly zero energy, and the
elastic cross section shows a corresponding peak of height
4π/k2 (or 8π/k2 for identical bosons).

A quantitative theoretical prediction of the scatter-
ing length is within reach today only for the lightest
diatomic systems and with the best available ab initio
potentials.87,88,89 For Li2, the sensitivity of scattering
length to small diﬀerences between potentials is illus-
trated in Table I. For heavier systems the variation of
scattering length with potential parameters is usually too
fast to allow quantitative predictions until experimental
data are available to help determine the scattering length.
The absolute accuracy of the cross sections presented
in this paper is limited by the quality of potential en-
ergy surface. The accuracy of the electronic energies is
degraded by the limitations of the correlation treatment
and the size of the basis set used. Moreover, the eﬀects
of conical intersections and the inﬂuence of the excited
electronic state have been neglected in our calculations.
It is thus very worthwhile to investigate how changes in
the potential energy surface aﬀect the ultracold scatter-
ing results.

Since the potential for Li2 is accurately known, we
modiﬁed the Li3 potential by scaling the nonadditive
part of the potential by a multiplicative parameter λ.
The depth of the global minimum Vmin varies with the
scaling factor as ∆Vmin/∆λ ≈ 5150 cm−1 over the range
studied.

The dependence of the elastic cross sections on the
scaling factor λ for 7Li + 7Li2(vi = 0, ni = 0) at ∼ 1
nK is shown in Figure 20. Whenever there is a bound
state at exactly zero energy, the scattering length passes
through a pole and the cross section shows a very high
peak (σ ≈ 4π/k2). Near each pole is a point where Sii =
1 so σ = 0. It may be seen that the cross section passes
through about 10 cycles for a 1% change in λ.

The mean value of the cross section can be estimated
using the formula for the mean scattering length a given
by Gribakin and Flambaum.86 Taking the isotropic atom-
molecule dispersion coeﬃcient C6 = 3085.54 Eha6
0, we
obtain a = 5.83 × 10−13 cm2, which underestimates our
accurate quantum results but gives the correct order of
magnitude.

For collisions of molecules in vibrationally excited
states (vi, ni = 0) with vi = 1 to 3, the dependence
of elastic and inelastic cross sections at ∼ 1 nK on λ is
shown in Figures 21 and 22. The dependence is again
oscillatory, but the frequency and amplitude of the oscil-
lations are smaller for higher initial vibrational quantum
numbers vi. The elastic (inelastic) cross sections vary
across the range by 186% (136%) for vi = 1 and 64%
(73%) for vi = 3. The sharp peaks in cross sections asso-
ciated with poles in scattering lengths are entirely washed
out for higher values of vi.

The lack of strong resonant peaks as a function of
well depth for Li + Li2 is an example of a general ef-
fect recently discussed by Hutson.90 Similar eﬀects have
recently been observed when tuning through zero-energy
Feshbach resonances in He + NH using magnetic ﬁelds.91
In the presence of inelastic scattering, the complex scat-
tering length a = α − iβ exhibits an oscillation rather
than a pole when a bound-state crosses threshold. The
amplitude of the oscillation is characterized by a reso-
nant scattering length ares. If the bound state is coupled
with comparable strengths to the elastic and inelastic
channels, the oscillation may be of relatively low am-
plitude and the peaks in cross sections are suppressed.

This is the case in Li + Li2, where there are strong cou-
plings between all the channels involved. For vi = 1 there
is enough resonant coupling to the elastic channel that
peaks are still observed, but even these have an ampli-
tude of only about a factor of 10. For higher vi, there are
larger numbers of inelastic channels, each of which com-
petes with the elastic channel and the resonant structures
are progressively washed out.

The suppression of cross-section peaks observed here
for Li + Li2 contrasts with the situation commonly found
for atom-atom scattering3 and for atom-molecule reac-
tive scattering in systems such as F + H2.92 For atom-
atom collisions involving atoms in spin-stretched states,
the resonant state is coupled to inelastic channels only
by very week magnetic dipole-dipole interactions, but is
coupled to the elastic channel by much stronger spin-
exchange terms. This gives a large value of ares, corre-
sponding to pole-like behavior of the scattering length
and producing very large peaks in cross sections. Sim-
ilarly, in F + H2 the resonances studied92 are due to
quasibound states in the entrance channel, while the “in-
elastic” channels are actually reactive channels that are
separated from the entrance well by a high barrier. This
again gives very large peaks in cross sections. It is evi-
dent that the factor that suppresses the resonant peaks
in Li + Li2 is strong coupling to the inelastic channels.

A sensitivity study similar to the one we report here
was performed on the Na + Na2 system by Qu´em´ener
et al.21 They also observed oscillations that decreased in
amplitude with initial v.

Isotope eﬀects

A strong suppression of inelastic rates has been ob-
served experimentally in fermionic systems tuned to a
large and positive atom-atom scattering length.8,9,10,93
The molecular cloud consisting of weakly bound dimers
of fermions exhibits remarkable stability against colli-
sional decay. By contrast, the vibrational relaxation for
weakly bound bosonic dimers is fast.4,5,7,18,94 The sup-
pression of inelastic scattering for fermionic systems has
been interpreted in terms of the requirements of Fermi
statistics.22,23.

We have repeated all the above scattering calculations
involving molecules in low-lying rovibrational states for
the fermionic system 6Li + 6Li2. A brief account of the
results was given in ref. 25. For 6Li + 6Li2, the domi-
nant contribution to cross sections in the ultracold regime
comes from total angular momentum J = 1−, which is
the partial wave that contains a contribution from li = 0.
Cross sections at a collision energy of ≈ 1 nK are shown
in Table III. The individual calculated values are signif-
icantly diﬀerent from the bosonic case, but the eﬀect is
not due to suppression by Fermi statistics. Instead, the
dominant eﬀects is that the change in nuclear mass alters
the scattering by a mechanism similar to a change in the
potential surface, as discussed in the previous subsection.
The cross sections calculated for individual initial states
are thus once again scattered essentially randomly about
a mean value. However, when we compare the results for
a variety of initial rovibrational states, we see that there
are no systematic diﬀerences between the overall rates
for bosonic and fermionic systems for the low vibrational
states that we have studied.

Unusually low inelastic rates (about an order of magni-
tude lower, with small Im(a)) were obtained for systems
that have a small number of energetically accessible in-
elastic channels, such as 6Li + 6Li2(vi = 0, ni = 3) and
7Li + 7Li2(vi = 0, ni = 2).

The energy dependence of

the cross sections in
fermionic systems is qualitatively similar to that de-
scribed above for bosonic systems. The Wigner regime
is reached at energies around 10−5 K. For non-zero ini-
tial end-over-end angular momenta, the simple relation-
ship of Eq. 16 holds at energies below the corresponding
centrifugal barriers. At higher energies, the energy de-
pendence of inelastic cross sections follows the Langevin
model, Eq. 20.

For spin-stretched 6Li + 6Li2 collisions, only odd ro-
tational levels of Li2 are allowed. Figure 23 shows the
product rotational distribution for vi = 1, ni = 1 in the
Wigner regime, and it may be seen that the distribution
is again oscillatory. At higher collision energies the oscil-
lations are washed out in the sum over partial waves, as
shown in Figure 24. However, as for the bosonic system,
the rotational distribution is signiﬁcantly non-statistical.
The forward-backward symmetry of the diﬀerential cross
sections predicted by statistical theory is also not present
for 6Li + 6Li2 at 116 mK, as seen in Figure 25.

G. Reactions in isotopic mixtures

A greater variety of atom–diatom collisions may be
observed in mixtures. Isotopic mixtures of 6Li and 7Li
are of considerable interest,95,96,97 and one can envisage
creating either homonuclear or heteronuclear dimers in
such a mixture. The atom-diatom collision systems of
interest are

7Li + 6Li7Li,

7Li + 6Li2.

(25)

We have studied all four of the systems (22) to (25) and
gave a preliminary report in ref. 26. The novel feature
in these systems is the possibility of a chemical reaction
in which the reactants and products are distinguishable.
Because of the diﬀerences in zero-point energy, the reac-
tions are exoergic even for ground-state molecules for the
two systems involving atomic 7Li, (22) and (23).

For 6Li7Li, both even and odd rotational levels are al-
lowed even for spin-stretched states. The higher density
of states makes these systems harder to treat computa-
tionally. Our calculations on these systems were therefore
restricted to the J = 0 and 1 partial waves and are thus
converged only at ultracold collision energies.

We will consider the systems that are reactive for
ground-state molecules ﬁrst. The cross sections, rate
coeﬃcients and scattering lengths for collisions of 7Li
with 6Li7Li in several diﬀerent initial molecular states
are summarized in Table IV. For molecules in excited
vibrational or rotational states, the cross sections are
comparable to those found for the homonuclear systems.
However, for 6Li7Li(v = 0, n = 0) the cross section for
reaction is a factor of about 50 smaller than for other
states. This corresponds to a reactive rate coeﬃcient
of 4.05 × 10−12 cm3 s−1 and Im(a) = 0.233 ˚A. In this
case there is only a single exoergic channel, with a ki-
netic energy release of 1.822 K. The small cross section
is probably due to the small volume of available phase
space for reaction.

The increased density of rotational states for 6Li7Li
produces an increased density of Feshbach resonances.
The energy-dependence of the eigenphase sum for 7Li +
6Li7Li is shown in the top panel of Figure 26. There
is a Feshbach resonance clearly visible at 225 mK and
another at about 470 mK, though the latter overlaps the
threshold for opening the n = 2 reactive channel at 477.2
mK. There are further overlapping resonances near 630
mK and 725 mK. The corresponding structures in the
elastic and inelastic cross sections are shown in the lower
two panels of Figure 26. The elastic cross section shows
a Ramsauer-Townsend minimum near 120 mK. It dips
to a very small value near the Feshbach resonance at
225 mK, but not near the resonance near 470 mK. The
reactive cross section, by contrast, dips close to zero at
both Feshbach resonances. This suggests the interesting
possibility of reducing the inelastic/elastic cross section
ratio by tuning close to a Feshbach resonance.

Reactive collisions of 7Li with 6Li2 are more strongly
spin-stretched states the 6Li2
exoergic because for
molecule is restricted to odd rotational levels while the
6Li7Li molecule is not. Because of this collisions of 7Li
with 6Li2 in its n = 1 ground state can produce 6Li7Li
in n = 0, 1 or 2. The calculated cross sections, rate coef-
ﬁcients and scattering lengths are summarized in Table
V. The reactive cross sections for 6Li2 (n = 1) are again
reduced compared to those for other states, but not as
dramatically as for 7Li + 6Li7Li (n = 0).

are nonreactive unless the molecule is initially in a rovi-
brationally excited state. This is because for these sys-
tems the zero-point energy is greater in the products than
in the reactants. The calculated cross sections, rate coef-
ﬁcients and scattering lengths for these systems are sum-
marized in Tables VI and VII. The patterns of cross sec-
tions for rovibrationally excited initial states are fairly
similar to those for the homonuclear systems, with no
particularly small inelastic or reactive rates. The novel
feature of these systems really lies in the fact that the
reactions are forbidden for ground-state molecules, so
that sympathetic cooling of molecules by contact with 6Li
atoms might be envisaged. For example, if 6Li2 molecules
are produced in the presence of both 6Li and 7Li, they
can react to form (relatively hot) 6Li7Li. If the 7Li atoms
are then removed, the molecules might be cooled by elas-
tic collisions with 6Li.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

We have developed a new potential energy surface for
quartet Li + Li2 from high-level electronic structure cal-
culations and used it to carry out quantum dynamics cal-
culations on elastic, inelastic and reactive collisions on Li
+ Li2 under cold and ultracold collisions. The potential
energy surface was calculated using RCCSD(T) calcula-
tions with all electrons correlated. The surface was cal-
culated on a grid in pure bond-length coordinates. It was
interpolated at short range using the interpolant-moving
least-squares method and merged with a long-range form
that is correct at both the atom-diatom and the atom-
atom-atom dissociation limits.

The potential energy surface has a deep triangular min-
imum that lies far below the atom-diatom energy and al-
lows barrierless atom exchange reactions. The well depth
is a factor of 4 deeper than would be expected on the basis
of a pairwise-additive sum of triplet Li2 potentials. The
surface exhibits a seam of conical intersections at linear
geometries, at energies close to that at three separated
Li atoms.

Quantum dynamics calculations were carried out in a
time-independent reactive scattering formalism based on
an expansion in pseudohyperspherical harmonics. This
approach makes it straightforward to include the required
symmetry with respect to exchange of identical bosons
(7Li atoms) or fermions (6Li atoms). For the homonu-
clear systems 7Li + 7Li2 and 6Li + 6Li2, the products of
reactive and non-reactive collisions are indistinguishable.
Nevertheless, all collisions involving vibrationally excited
Li2 result in very fast vibrational relaxation (quench-
ing). For the low-lying vibrationally excited states stud-
ied here, there is no systematic suppression of quenching
rates for collisions involving fermion dimers (6Li2). This
contrasts with the situation found both experimentally
and theoretically for fermion dimers produced by Fesh-
bach resonance tuning in their highest vibrational state.
For collisions involving mixtures of Li isotopes, reactive
and nonreactive collision outcomes can be distinguished.
In particular, for collisions of 7Li atoms with either 6Li2

19

or 6Li7Li, exoergic reactive collisions are possible even
for vanishing kinetic energy because of the diﬀerence in
zero-point energy between reactants and products. These
reactive processes are generally very fast, except for the
case of 7Li + 6Li7Li (v = 0, n = 0) at collision ener-
gies below 477 mK, for which there is only one reactive
channel.

The Li + Li2 collision systems have a rich structure of
scattering resonances at low energies. These are princi-
pally rotational Feshbach resonances due to quasibound
states that correlate with rotationally excited diatomic
molecules. Tuning such Feshbach resonances with ap-
plied magnetic ﬁelds oﬀers possibilities for controlling ul-
tracold molecular collisions, and this will be a topic for
future work.

We have investigated the sensitivity of elastic and in-
elastic cross sections to variations in the interaction po-
tential. Such variations tune Feshbach resonances across
thresholds, and our expectation was that the cross sec-
tions would show very large peaks when this occurred.
This is indeed the case for collisions of ground-state
molecules where only elastic scattering is possible. For
such collisions the elastic cross sections increase by many
orders of magnitude close to each resonance, and the den-
sity of states is such that a 1% change in the potential
depth sweeps about 10 resonances across threshold. How-
ever, for collisions where inelastic scattering is also pos-
sible the resonant behavior is strongly suppressed. The
amplitude of the oscillations in cross sections decreases
dramatically with increasing initial vibrational quantum
number, and for v = 3 the cross section changes by no
more than a factor of 2 as resonances cross threshold.
This shows that, in some cases, cross sections are much
less sensitive to small variations in the potential than was
previously expected.

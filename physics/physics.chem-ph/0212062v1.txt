The photoabsorption spectra of calcium-doped argon clusters CaArn are investigated at thermal
equilibrium using a variety of theoretical and numerical tools. The inﬂuence of temperature on the
absorption spectra is estimated using the quantum superposition method for a variety of cluster
sizes in the range 6 ≤ n ≤ 146. At the harmonic level of approximation, the absorption intensity is
calculated through an extension of the Gaussian theory by Wadi and Pollak [J. Chem. Phys. 110,
11890 (1999)]. This theory is tested on simple, few-atom systems in both the classical and quantum
regimes for which highly accurate Monte Carlo data can be obtained. By incorporating quantum
anharmonic corrections to the partition functions and respective weights of the isomers, we show
that the superposition method can correctly describe the ﬁnite-temperature spectroscopic properties
of CaArn systems. The use of the absorption spectrum as a possible probe of isomerization or phase
changes in the argon cluster is discussed at the light of ﬁnite-size eﬀects.

INTRODUCTION

Large van der Waals clusters oﬀer a convenient medium
to study solvation at the molecular level, and also to
undertake chemical reactions with well deﬁned thermo-
dynamical conditions.1,2,3 Reactivity of chromophore-
doped rare-gas clusters has been the subject of intense
experimental eﬀort.4,5,6,7,8,9 Photodissociation of HBr on
argon clusters has been investigated by Baumfalk et
al.,4,5,6 including a theoretical study of the HBr–cluster
interaction.5 Chemiluminescence in the bimolecular reac-
BaO∗+N2 was the subject of a work by
tion Ba+N2O
Gaveau et al.,7 and photodetachment in IHI−Arn clus-
ters was used to probe transition state spectroscopy of
the I+HI reaction by Liu and coworkers.8 One may also
cite the photoinduced reaction dynamics between Ca∗
and HBr towards CaBr∗+H at the surface of a large ar-
gon cluster carried out by Briant et al.9 Very recently, the
reaction between N2O and Li2 mediated by Arn clusters
has been investigated by Breckenridge and coworkers.10

A practical understanding of the physical and chemi-
cal properties of the deposited species relies on a good
characterization of their spectroscopy.
In turn, spec-
troscopy gives great insight into the structure of the van
der Waals complex, especially in concern with the lo-
cation of the chromophore.11,12,13 This idea was used
to propose a way of detecting structural transforma-
tions inside the cluster.14,15 Not long after its was dis-
covered in simulations,16 the so-called dynamical co-
existence phenomenon between solidlike and liquidlike
phases received some experimental evidence by Hahn
and Whetten who reported changes in the excitation
spectrum of benzene-(argon)n clusters with increasing
temperature.14 Similar experimental results were re-
ported for dichloroanthracene-Arn clusters by Even et
al.15 More recently, Curotto and coworkers17,18,19 theo-
retically investigated the infrared spectroscopy in Arn-
HF clusters. They observed signiﬁcant variations in the
red shift associated with the two lowest vibrational states

of the HF molecule, which they could correlate with the
thermodynamical state of the cluster.17,18,19 Moseler et
al.20 found that the photoabsorption spectra of Na8 dis-
plays some features characteristic of isomerization and
structural ﬂuctuations. Lastly, simulations on charged
rare-gas clusters have investigated the inﬂuence of tem-
perature on the absorption spectrum.21,22 So far, no di-
rect evidence for isomerization in such rare-gas clusters
has been found yet.

While spectroscopy has many attractive features for
experimental studies in large clusters, several diﬃcul-
ties pave the way for eﬃcient theoretical approaches.
Firstly, because of the numerous degrees of freedom, a
fully quantum calculation of the absorption spectrum by
exact methods (wavepacket or diagonalization in a ba-
sis) is not feasible beyond a few atoms and one is usually
lead to simplify the problem. A common approxima-
tion is the Condon hypothesis, which assumes vertical
transitions. Secondly, the equilibrium properties at ﬁ-
nite temperature require some sampling of the ground
state potential energy surface (PES). This sampling can
be hard to get because of the topography of the multidi-
mensional PES (the so-called energy landscape). When
the energy landscape is complicated or has multiple fun-
nels, the relaxation to equilibrium may be particularly
slow with a glassy-like behavior.23 Broken ergodicity is
then likely to occur in conventional molecular dynam-
ics (MD) or Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, and also in
quantum simulations. Fortunately some remedies to this
problem have recently been suggested, including multi-
canonical ensemble sampling24 or parallel tempering.25
Thirdly, most experiments involving chromophore-doped
rare-gas clusters take place at low temperatures, at which
the classical approximation may be questioned, especially
for the lighter elements neon and helium. Path-integral
Monte Carlo or centroid MD should then be used instead
of classical techniques, however their use with ergodicity
restoring strategies remains numerically demanding for
systems containing tens or hundreds degrees of freedom.

We have recently proposed an alternative way of
calculating thermodynamical observables at canonical
equilibrium, using the superposition approximation of
quantum oscillators.26 This method, originally devel-
oped for thermodynamical observables only, was im-
proved phenomenologically by including anharmonic
corrections,26,27 and extended to generally treat other
temperature-dependent observables.28 Its main interest
is to circumvent the troubles of broken ergodicity by con-
sidering separately the contribution of each isomer to the
partition function. The method also naturally describes
quantum delocalization in a straightforward way.

One goal of this paper is to extend the quantum su-
perposition method to the realm of calculating photoab-
sorption spectra. In addition to the ingredients presently
available, one needs to calculate the photoabsorption
spectrua of each stable isomer. For this, we use a recent
theory by Wadi and Pollak29 that we have extended to
the general case of arbitrary potential surfaces. As will be
seen below, this Gaussian theory of absorption succeeds
in predicting absorption line shapes, widths and shifts for
harmonic polyatomic molecules in good agreement with
highly accurate Monte Carlo data.

With the quantum superposition method, we are able
to carry out systematic studies for a given set of clus-
ter sizes. We can then address our second goal, and try
to relate the features of the absorption spectrum to the
knowledge of isomerizations and possible phase changes
inside the cluster. More speciﬁcally, by looking at par-
ticular sizes we hope to gain insight in the relationship
between structure, temperature, quantum delocalization,
and the shape and position of the spectral lines.

This work follows previous eﬀorts aimed at inter-
preting experimental absorption spectra on large CaArn
clusters.13 The spectroscopy of the CaAr diatomic
molecule has been investigated both experimentally and
with ab initio calculations in Ref. 30, and a Diatomic-
In-Molecules (DIM) Hamiltonian was constructed to
model the 4s ground- and 4s4p excited-states of CaArn
clusters.13 In the present context of ﬁnite-temperature
spectroscopy, the heavy numerical cost of statistical sam-
pling is balanced with this relatively cheap, albeit ac-
curate Hamiltonian. The paper is organized as follows.
In the next section, we brieﬂy recall the quantum su-
perposition method in the harmonic approximation. We
also include the derivation of approximate perturbative
anharmonic quantum corrections to the partition func-
tions. The Gaussian theory of absorption for harmonic
molecules, initially proposed by Wadi and Pollak,29 will
be generalized to include possible Duschinskii rotations
in Sec. III. These methods will be tested on simple clus-
ters, in both the classical and quantum regimes, by com-
paring their results to high statistics Monte Carlo data.
Their main application to the variations of the photoab-
sorption spectrum with temperature in some size-speciﬁc
CaArn clusters will be presented in Sec. IV. The results
will be discussed in view of the isomerization and phase
changes phenomena. Some concluding remarks will close

the paper in Sec. V.

II. QUANTUM SUPERPOSITION METHOD

In the superposition approach,31,32,33 also known as
the multiple normal modes model,34 the total partition
function Z of the N
atom system in equilibrium at tem-
perature T = 1/kBβ is replaced by a sum over stable
minima

X
Each minimum α, or inherent structure, has a contribu-
tion Zα to Z, further weighted by the degeneracy factor
nα, which accounts for permutational isomers and global
symmetry. In CaArn clusters (N = n + 1), nα is given by
2n!/hα, where hα is the order of the point group of struc-
ture α. The problem has now been reduced to estimating
the individual functions Zα. At the simplest level of ap-
proximation, the harmonic vibrational frequencies
provide a zero-th order expression for Zα:

regime ¯h
0, the decomposition (1) is formally exact,
since each point of the conﬁguration space (except saddle
points) belong to one and only one basin α. In the quan-
tum regime (ﬁnite ¯h), tunnelling is neglected.26 In princi-
ple, the knowledge of all minima of the energy landscape
allows us to calculate any thermodynamical observable,
including internal energy and heat capacity, from Eq. (1).
However, for all but the smallest atomic systems, exhaus-
tive enumeration of these isomers is not possible because
the number of local minima is thought to grow expo-
nentially with the number of degrees of freedom.35 To
correct for the uncompleteness of the available set of iso-
mers, a reweighting technique can be used.26,33 The idea
is to perform a simulation at a reference temperature T0,
and to compute the probability pα of observing isomer
α. The partition function Z is approximated as a partial
sum over weighted isomers:

Z(β)

gαnαZα(β),

(3)

′

∝

α
X

with the partial character of the sum indicated by the
prime symbol. If we assume that the weights
are
independent of temperature, the probability pα(T0) of
ﬁnding isomer α at T0 is proportional to gαnαZα(β0).
Hence, Z can be expressed as

A classical simulation can be used to sample the min-
ima and their respective weights.26 In the above equa-
tion, the denominators Zα(β0) should then be replaced
by their classical analogue. Even though the resulting
partition function (4) should not depend on the classical
or quantum nature of the simulation, some diﬀerences
can be seen when using semiclassical simulations includ-
ing quantum corrections.28 This reweighting procedure
has been shown to improve signiﬁcantly the predictions
of the superposition method.
In particular, Wales was
able to obtain a ’S-bend’ in the kinetic temperature of
Ar55,33 as seen previously in simulations.36

The other important limitation of the method is the
harmonic approximation used to calculate Zα(β). Sev-
eral phenomenological anharmonic corrections have been
proposed in the litterature for classical systems.27,37 In
the case of quantum systems, the optimal normal modes
method of Cao and Voth38 can be used to include anhar-
monicity to some extent, but the self-consistency required
makes it computationally heavy for large sets of isomers.
Building upon a recent eﬀort to include systematic cor-
rections from the energy surface topography via classical
perturbation theory,39 we can attempt to include anhar-
monicities in the quantum partition functions Zα in a
more rigorous fashion. Since the classical corrections are
also numerically demanding, we restrict ourselves to low-
order corrective terms. In order to make the reading eas-
ier, the details of the perturbation expansion are given in
the Appendix. The superposition method not only pro-
vides the thermodynamical equilibrium properties, and
other quantities can be computed provided they can be
calculated for each minimum α.28 At thermal equilib-

III. GAUSSIAN THEORY OF ABSORPTION

We assume that the cluster is in canonical equilibrium
at temperature T = 1/kBβ, and that it undergoes an ex-
citation by an inﬁnitely narrow pulse at frequency ω from
its ground state potential surface Vg(R). The normalized

and where Z(β) = Tr e−βHg is the partition function.
Following Wadi and Pollak,29 we now perform a short-
time expansion in the correlation function. This expan-
sion should be valid at moderate temperatures and for a
large number of degrees of freedom. Indeed, in such cases
the combination of the numerous vibrational modes will
signiﬁcantly dephase rapidly, and the correlation func-
tion will be nonzero only for short times. Using this ap-
proximation, the absorption intensity can be calculated
analytically29 as a Gaussian function:

In these equations, Wg is the mass-weighted Hessian ma-
trix of the ground state at the lowest energy minimum
Q0, which is assumed to be located at the origin 0 of the
reference frame. Wg can be written as Wg = diag (ω2

as it is diagonal by construction. We = (wij

ond derivatives matrix of the excited state surface at Q0.
Lastly, G = ∂He(Q0)/∂Q is the excited state gradient at
Q0. The matrix We is not assumed to be diagonal, and
may include the so-called Duschinskii rotations.41 It is

Apart from the diﬀerent notations, the above expressions
diﬀer from the results by Wadi and Pollak by the second
term in the right-hand side of Eq. (15), which was ne-
glected by these authors.29 Although Eqn. (14) and (15)
are only valid for polyatomic, harmonic systems, anhar-
monic corrections can be carried out in the very same
way as the perturbative expansion mentioned in the pre-
vious section and detailed in the Appendix. However,
the present expressions are already the outcome of an
approximation in the correlation function, hence we did
not attempt to include such corrections here.
In addi-
tion, their estimation would require the computation of
higher order derivatives of the excited states energy sur-
faces, which will be a heavy numerical task, even for for
DIM potentials.

We have tested the Gaussian theory on small CaArn
clusters. The ground- and excited-state Hamiltonians
have been fully described previously.13 They are based
on the Diatomic-In-Molecules (DIM) formalism,42 and
were parameterized on ab initio calculations.30 To give a
better account of experimental properties of the CaAr di-
atomics, we have slightly modiﬁed the parameters with
respect to our previous works.13,28 The Ca–Ar ground
state pairwise potential has been scaled by 0.85, and the
excited state surfaces have been shifted by +305 cm−1
to ﬁt the 4s4p experimental transition in calcium. As a
consequence, some global minima may have changed, as
in CaAr37.

→

In the present work, we focus on the 4s2

4s4p
transitions, which have received some experimental
attention.13 The DIM Hamiltonian provides the energy
and numerical derivatives, as well as the electronic tran-
sition dipole moment, for any atomic conﬁguration R. It
can thus be used to simulate absolute absorption spectra.
The ground state vibrational eigenmodes and eigenfre-
were obtained from the diagonalization of
ωgi}
quencies
the Hessian matrix whose elements were computed from
their analytical expressions.
In both the classical and
quantum cases, the absolute spectrum is calculated as
the sum over the three possible excited states. For the
Gaussian theory, the three gaussian curves are weighted
by the square of the transition dipole moment at the
equilibrium ground state geometry.

First, we have calculated the classical spectrum from
0, and from
the Gaussian theory in the classical limit ¯h
classical Metropolis Monte Carlo simulations at low tem-
perature, using 106 cycles following 2
105 equilibration
cycles. The spectra of CaAr13 and CaAr54 at T = 5 K are
displayed in Fig. 1. For comparison, we have also plotted
the predictions of the Gaussian theory in the classical
0. In this limit, the line shift and line width

The reliability of our comparison was checked by ensuring
that only a single isomer was visited during the Metropo-
lis MC simulation. As can be seen in Fig. 1, the accuracy
of the Gaussian theory is very good at such low tempera-
tures. The global minimum geometry of CaAr13 has two
spectral lines located at 23658 (2 degenerate lines) and
24034 cm−1, respectively. Due to its ﬁnite temperature,
the cluster loses its instantaneous symmetry and the de-
generacy is lifted. This explains why three distinct lines
are seen in Fig. 1(a). In CaAr54 the Gaussian theory of
absorption remains in good agreement with Monte Carlo
data. This cluster has again 2 degenerate sharp lines at
23715 cm−1, and one broad line at 24080 cm−1. This
time, the degeneracy is no longer lifted by temperature,
and the two lines still merge into a single peak. In the
classical theory the absorption intensity can also be ob-
tained analytically by integrating Eq. (7) under the Con-
don assumption without performing the short-time ex-
pansion. Therefore, in the classical case, the diﬀerences
between the calculated and simulated spectra in Fig. 1
can be attributed to anharmonicities only.

We now turn to a more complicated situation, namely
CaAr37 in the quantum regime, and at moderate temper-
ature T = 25 K. We will show below that this tempera-
ture is located just above the melting point of this cluster.
Many isomers are present, and this will provide a test
of the superposition approximation. In the simulation,
quantum eﬀects have been included in a quasiclassical,
corrective way by adding the corrective Feynman-Hibbs
eﬀective potential43 to the ground state energy. This po-
tential was shown to give good results on argon clusters
with respect to the more accurate Fourier-path-integral
Monte Carlo simulation of Neirotti and coworkers,44 es-
pecially when compared with the alternative Wigner-
Kirkwood corrections.45 Since it is quasiclassical in na-
ture, it cannot be used in the low temperature regime
T <
5 K where only few isomers are present, and path-
∼
integral simulations would have to be carried out in-
stead. Because the superposition method does not as-
sume any barrier nor pathway between the isomers, it
yields supposedly ergodic data within the set of available
minima. Therefore a reliable comparison with simula-
tion results must also correct for possible broken ergod-
icity, and for this we have used parallel tempering Monte
Carlo.25 Also, since the eﬀective potential explicitely de-
pends on temperature, the probability of accepting an
exchange between adjacent trajectories should be modi-
ﬁed accordingly.46

Concerning the superposition approximation, and to
quantify the importance of perturbative corrections
in the partition function, we have separately consid-
ered zero-th order harmonic as well as second-order,

we cannot tell whether the visible shifts and broadenings
are an eﬀect of temperature only, or of the diﬀerent spec-
troscopic signatures of the other isomers present. Some
shifts in the peaks remain slightly approximate in the
superposition approach, and the second-order corrected
weights only marginally improve the results. At 25 K,
quantum eﬀects turn out to be rather small on the line
width and shape, but they may be more important on
the weights of the isomers, as will be seen below. There-
fore, from Fig 2 we see that anharmonic corrections to
the isomers weights have a relatively weak inﬂuence for
quasiclassical clusters. More information on the impor-
tance of these corrections will be gained by looking at
the thermodynamical curves in the next section.

The Gaussian theory presented in this section can be
extended to purely quantum systems at T = 0, for which
delocalization is only due to the quantum nature of the
vibrational modes, but not to an actual atomic displace-
ment induced by a ﬁnite energy deposit.
In this pur-
pose, the Boltzmann weights in Eqn. (6) and (7) are re-
placed by the probability density of ﬁnding the system in
its ground state at conﬁguration R as the square of the
wavefunction. In the harmonic approximation, this prob-
ability density is a multidimensional Gaussian function,
and the integrated absorption spectrum is found to be
Gaussian with line shape and width given by the β
limits of Eqn. (14) and (15):

FIG. 3: Absorption spectra of (a) CaAr2 and (b) CaAr13 at T = 0 K from diﬀusion Monte Carlo simulations (solid lines) and
the Gaussian theory (dashed lines). For CaAr2, we have also represented the results of wavepacket relaxation calculations (long
dashed line).

The behavior of the Gaussian theory in the T = 0 quan-
tum case has been tested on CaAr2 and CaAr13 using
simple diﬀusion Monte Carlo (DMC) in internal coor-
dinates (without global rotation and translation), and
without importance sampling. The DMC calculations
were carried out with 1000 replicas, and the wave func-
tions were averaged over 105 steps after 105 initial equili-
bration steps.
In addition, for CaAr2, the vibrational
ground state wavefunction was also computed numer-
ically on grids, using quantum wavepacket relaxation
(WPR) method (imaginary time propagation).47 The
propagation was performed for zero total angular mo-
mentum, representing the wavepacket by an harmonic os-
cillator Discrete Variable Representation (DVR) for each
of the two Ca–Ar bond coordinates, and by a Legen-
dre DVR for the bending angle
ArCaAr. The primitive
basis for representing one bond coordinate includes 10
harmonic oscillator eigenfunctions. Associated Legendre
functions with j < 60 and m = 0 were used for repre-
senting the bending mode. In both the DMC and WPR
methods, which are both supposed to give essentially ex-
act results, the absorption spectrum was calculated as-
suming vertical transitions from the quantum sample of
geometries.

its equilibrium geometry, CaAr2 has three nondegener-
ate spectroscopic lines at 23621, 23670, and 23918 cm−1,
respectively. Quantum delocalization of the vibrational
modes leads to a rather small shift of these lines, and to a
signiﬁcant broadening. For CaAr13, the simulated peaks
are also in good agreement with the Gaussian prediction,
but we notice that some asymmetry is visible on the “ex-
act” spectrum from diﬀusion Monte Carlo. These eﬀects

are clearly beyond a Gaussian description, and are due to
anharmonic eﬀects. These eﬀects are relatively weak for
the rather heavy calcium-doped argon clusters but may
become more important for neon or helium clusters.

The above results suggest that the Gaussian the-
ory of photoabsorption developed by Wadi and Pollak29
upon the formal results of Yan and Mukamel40 can give
quite accurate results in both the classical and quantum
regimes at low and moderate temperatures.

IV. SPECTROSCOPIC SIGNATURE OF PHASE
CHANGES

The Gaussian theory described in the previous Section
will now be used with the superposition approach to in-
vestigate the inﬂuence of temperature on the absorption
spectra in context with isomerization phenomena.

For the two smallest clusters chosen, CaAr6 and
CaAr10, we performed extensive sampling of the ground
state PES, and we believe that nearly all stable isomers
have been identiﬁed. To apply the superposition method
to larger CaArn clusters, the reweighting procedure from
simulations must be used. Quasiclassical parallel temper-
ing Monte Carlo simulations of 107 + 2
106 equilibra-
tion cycles were used, for a set of temperatures equally
60 K for
spaced by 2.5 K in the range 7.5 K
T
n
75 K for CaAr146. The iso-
mers were found by quenching the 50 K trajectory for
all sizes except CaAr37, for which the 25 K trajectory
was used, and CaAr146, quenched at 60 K. Local mini-
mizations were performed every 500 cycles. To prevent
evaporation, a rigid spherical container was used in the
MC simulation.36,48 The radii of the containers and the

are given in Table I for the set of sizes chosen. We have
also indicated the point group and energy of the global
minima after including the zero-point harmonic contri-
bution. These lowest-energy structures were generated
from the basin-hopping or Monte Carlo + minimization
algorithm.49 They are shown in Fig. 4.
In most cases,
the global minimum of CaArn is very similar to the one
of Arn+1, with one argon atom substituted by calcium.
Due to the lower binding energy and larger equilibrium
distance of CaAr with respect to Ar2,30 calcium is always
found on the surface of the remaining argon cluster. The
nearly identical masses of calcium and argon atoms also
induces relatively small changes in the vibrational prop-
erties, and the similarities between CaArn and Arn+1
remain when including the zero-point corrections. How-
ever, in the case of CaAr37, we ﬁnd the somewhat sur-
prising result that the global minimum geometry is deca-
hedral, and remains so after including the harmonic zero
point energy contribution. Slightly higher in energy, sev-
eral icosahedral structures are found, either in the form
of uncomplete multilayer icosahedra (Mackay type) or as
polyicosahedra (anti-Mackay type). As in Ar38, quantum
delocalization favors anti-Mackay structures over Mackay

shapes,26 yet a Mackay structure is found as the sec-
ond isomer in both the classical and quantum regimes.
This isomer is represented in Fig. 4(f). Additionally, the
distorted truncated octahedron geometry lies above, but
very close, to these isomers. As a consequence, the en-
ergy landscape of this particular cluster reveals interest-
ing features, which will be investigated more deeply in the
following article of this series.50 This result is also consis-
tent with the richer thermodynamical behavior generally
observed in mixed van der Waals clusters with respect to
homogeneous clusters.51,52

Therefore, even though CaArn and Arn+1 clusters
share many structural features, they also exhibit signif-
icant and unexpected diﬀerences, which could aﬀect the
thermodynamics and dynamics in large extents.

sented in Fig. 5(a). For comparison, we have also plotted
on the same curves the direct results of parallel tem-
pering Monte Carlo with the Feynman-Hibbs eﬀective
potential.43 As is well known for this potential,26 the
canonical heat capacity diverges upwards at low tem-
peratures. Due to its small size, this cluster shows a
nearly featureless caloric curve, and a ﬂat heat capacity
(except the low temperature increase) in Fig. 5(a). The
small hump at T
20–25 K is indicative of isomeriza-
tions, and is followed by another bump near 45 K in the
MC simulation. This latter broad peak is in fact spu-
rious, as it comes from the dissociation of the weakly
bound Ca atom. Previous works53,54 have identiﬁed this
peak as the signature of the liquid-vapor transition, from
its dependence on the container radius. Here it would
have been diﬃcult to employ a radius smaller than 6˚A,
because the motion of argon atoms would have been
hindered. The 25 K hump is barely visible, because it
is hidden and smoothed out by quantum eﬀects. The
agreement between the superposition approximation and
the quasiclassical MC simulations is very good except for
the extra liquid-vapor bump. This feature is obviously
missing from the assumptions made in the superposition
method. The quantitative eﬀect of perturbative correc-
tions is small for this cluster.

CaAr10 has the ground state of an uncomplete icosa-
hedron. Some isomers involving diﬀerent locations of the
calcium atom lie not far above the global minimum, re-
sulting in a shoulder in the heat capacity near 10–15 K
in Fig. 5(b). The main peak near 30 K is due to a more
complete rearrangement of argon atoms, and is repro-
duced quantitatively by the superposition approach after
including perturbative corrections in the partition func-
tion.

The absorption spectra of these two clusters are rep-
resented in Fig. 5(c) and 5(d) as a function of temper-
ature. In each of these ﬁgures, the classical spectra ob-
tained from the limit ¯h
0 has been superimposed to
the quantum spectra. For the two sizes, the patterns are
rather similar: the spectrum varies from a clear three-
peak structure at low temperature towards a mostly sin-
gle peak shape at high temperatures. The transition oc-
curs roughly at 20 K in CaAr6, and near 30 K in CaAr10.

→

In the case of CaAr6 the high temperature main peak
appears made of two smaller peaks, in agreement with
simulations.55 From a general point of view, quantum ef-
fects mainly consist in a broadening of the peaks. As
expected, they get smaller and smaller as temperature
increases, and becomes barely visible above 25 K.

Therefore, in these two small clusters, absorption spec-
troscopy seems to be an eﬀective mean of detecting iso-
merization events, as the range of variation in the spec-
trum approximately matches the width of the heat capac-
ity changes. As cluster size grows, one can thus expect
to see sharper transitions, and to possibly use the cal-
cium chromophore as a probe of the argon cluster melting
point.

We have chosen a set of sizes in the range 13

54,
spanning between 1 and 2 icosahedral layers, and which
are likely to exhibit signiﬁcant ﬁnite size eﬀects. We
ﬁrst discuss the thermodynamical behavior of these clus-
ters. The heat capacities obtained using the superpo-
sition method, with harmonic or second-order corrected
anharmonic partition functions, are represented in Fig. 6
for the clusters corresponding to n = 13, 30, 37, and
54. In the case of the larger cluster CaAr54, and also for
CaAr146, it was not possible to include all the required
anharmonic corrections due to the too large computa-
tional requirements. Since they are not the main focus
of the present paper, these thermodynamical data will be
only brieﬂy discussed in order to guide our interpretation
of the following absorption spectra.

In general, we ﬁnd again a rather good agreement be-
tween the quantum superposition results and the Monte
Carlo simulations for all four sizes. As expected, anhar-
monic corrections do have a positive quantitative eﬀect
by bringing the superposition data closer to the simu-
lation results. However, no new qualitative feature is
visible when they are taken into account. All heat ca-
pacities exhibit a main peak indicative of the solidlike-
liquidlike phase change.36 This peak is located near 40–
45 K for CaAr13, CaAr30 and CaAr54, and near 20 K for

CaAr37. This lower melting point is similar to what is
observed in the 38-atom argon cluster described by the
Lennard-Jones potential.56,57 In addition to this main
peak, extra humps or even peaks can be observed at
lower temperatures in CaAr30 and CaAr37. These fea-
tures are indicative of preliminary isomerization result-
ing from solid-solid transitions in these clusters.58 Again,
they bear similarities with the known ﬁnite temperature
behavior of LJ clusters with the same size.56,57,59,60 In
CaAr13, the quantum character of the speciﬁc heat hides
again a shoulder in the classical curve, as is the case in
CaAr6. This cluster happens to have a much larger num-
ber of stable isomers than Ar14. In particular the capped
icosahedron can be found with the calcium atom either
in adatom location (lowest energy structure) or inside
the icosahedral shell, resulting in a set of 4 diﬀerent iso-
mers slightly higher in energy. Structures not based on

the capped icosahedron, or with the calcium atom in the
center of the icosahedron, are less stable than these ﬁve
geometries. Therefore the energy spectrum of local min-
ima can be put into three sets, one being the global min-
imum only, one being the other capped icosahedral iso-
mers with calcium in the icosahedral shell, and all other
isomers not build on the capped icosahedron motif. Be-
cause of these three sets, the melting process involves es-
sentially two steps. In Fig. 7(a) we plot the probabilities
of ﬁnding the CaAr13 cluster in its ground state, or in one
of the 4 subsequent isomers, or in the remaining, liquid
conﬁgurations. These probabilities are computed using
the anharmonic corrected quantum partition functions.
They display a clear two-step isomerization pattern. In
the ﬁrst step, at about 30 K, the calcium atom is able to
leave its capping site in favor of one of the twelve icosahe-
dral sites. Then, above 40 K, more disordered structures

In CaAr30 the preliminary solid-solid transition near
2.5 K involves polyicosahedral and multilayer icosahedral
isomers, as in Ar31.26,59 Even though CaAr37 does not
have the same global minimum as Ar38, a similar ther-
modynamic behavior occurs. We have calculated from
the harmonic superposition approximation the probabil-
ities of ﬁnding the cluster either in its decahedral ground
state isomer, in its (Mackay-type) icosahedral isomers, or
in any of the remaining isomers. The variation of these
probabilities with increasing temperature are displayed
in Fig. 7(b). They show that the transition at about 5 K
is due to a global decahedral-icosahedral rearrangement,
and bears some similarity with the (C60)14 cluster.61
The anti-Mackay and truncated octahedral structures
are only marginally populated at thermal equilibrium,
and the main heat capacity peak is associated with the
emergence of a large number of disordered conﬁgurations.
Hence it can be considered as the signature of melting.

For comparison, we have also plotted in Fig. 7(b) the cor-
responding curves in the classical limit. While the global
behavior remains essentially unchanged, the preliminary
transition occurs at a higher temperature, near 10 K.

In
CaAr13, the spectrum gradually evolves from a two-peak

another two-peak structure (at about 23650 and 23800

30 K, and originates from isomers where the Ca atom

melting at 40 K is seen in Fig. 8(a), however the present
spectra can still be interpreted in terms of isomerizations
within the cluster.

In the case of CaAr30, the low temperature isomer-
ization below 5 K has a strong eﬀect on the absorption
peaks, which are red shifted by about 200 wavenumbers.
The spectra of this cluster also evolves very continuously,
and the two main peaks at 23550 and 24000 cm−1 un-
dergo a slight red shift and thermal broadening. The
weak melting phase change is reﬂected on these spectra,
and the most prominent feature remains the sharp iso-
merization below 5 K.

∼

Near T = 10 K, the multiple peak structure of the
spectrum in CaAr37 also reveals that several isomers are
coexisting with distinct spectroscopic signatures. The
solid-solid transition seen in the heat capacity of CaAr37
at low temperature is reﬂected on the absorption spectra
in Fig. 8(c). The three-peak T = 0 K spectrum is pe-
culiar to the decahedral ground state. At T
10 K, a
signiﬁcant blue shift occurs in the middle peak, provid-
ing a signature of the icosahedral isomers. The quanti-
tative diﬀerence in the solid-solid transition temperature
induced by quantum eﬀect is also seen in the absorption
spectra between 5 and 15 K. Near 15 K, the spectrum
can be clearly separated into more than three peaks, and
suggests that distinct icosahedral isomers are present. At
around 20 K, the various peaks merge into a double-peak
structure, where the peak at 23800 cm−1 dominates the
one at 24750 cm−1. Here we ﬁnd a clear thermodynam-
ical inﬂuence on the spectroscopic properties. Hence, in
this cluster, the absorption spectrum contains notable
informations about isomerization and phase changes, in-
cluding some rather ﬁne details on the characteristic tem-
peratures.

The equilibrium geometry of CaAr54 is a double layer
Mackay icosahedron where the Ca atom is located on
a vertex site, thus keeping a relatively high symmetry
(C5v). As in Ar55, the heat capacity near peak 40 K
indicates volume melting,33,36 while preliminary surface
melting has a very small thermal signature. In Fig. 8(d)
we observe that the two absorption peaks undergo a sig-
niﬁcant change near 30 K, and this corresponds to co-
existing isomers with the Ca atom located on diﬀerent
substitutional sites of the external icosahedral shell. In
this case the photoexcitation spectrum is sensitive to sur-
face melting. At higher temperatures T > 40 K, many
isomers are found in which the metal atom is more fully
solvated by argon. The spectra show another qualitative
change, as the peak near 23600 cm−1 disappears and is
replaced by a broad bump near 24300 cm−1.

C. CaAr146

It is interesting to compare the situation in CaAr54
with the one in the larger Mackay icosahedron, CaAr146.
As in CaAr54, the ground state equilibrium geometry has
C5v symmetry, with calcium located in a vertex site of the
external icosahedral layer. This cluster has a huge num-
ber of isomers, and many high lying minima are missed
during the quenching process.
In the vast majority of
structures in our sample the calcium atom remains in
the outer argon layers. This is not surprising, since, and
as was previously mentioned, the calcium-argon bond is
weaker by about 70% than the argon-argon bond.13 De-
spite the relatively small size of our sample with respect
to the number of existing structures, the heat capacities
in Fig. 9(a) exhibit a reasonably good agreement between

simulation and the superposition method, the high peak
near 55 K being the signature of the solidlike-liquidlike
phase change. Melting is essentially caused by the mo-
tion of argon atoms, and is relatively unsensitive to the
location of calcium. This explains the shape and the evo-
lution of the absorption spectrum in Fig. 9(b). The two
peaks at 23720 and 24150 cm−1 become broader and van-
ish between 25 K and 30 K, to be replaced by a major
peak at 23600 cm−1. This transition is correlated with
ﬂuctuations in the location of the calcium atom over the
cluster surface. On the other hand, melting at 55 K does
not lead to any visible change in the absorption spectrum.

D. Discussion

The above results may not be immediately amenable
to experimental comparison, because of the problem of
size selection. Our simulation results show that com-

plex isomerizations involving strong changes in the local
environment of calcium could be, in principle, detected
in experiments on size-selected clusters initially thermal-
ized. However a typical sample of clusters in molecular
beams is made of a broad size distribution, where the
width and the center have values close to each other. The
common feature of these clusters is the surface location
of the calcium atom, and we may expect the absorption
spectrum to be a possible probe of surface melting in
these clusters, provided that the surface melting temper-
ature does not signiﬁcantly depend on cluster size. Even
though calcium in bulk argon has a very distinct, three-
peak spectroscopic signature,13 it may be hard to detect
volume melting in which calcium would be fully solvated.
In fact, such van der Waals clusters evaporate atoms at
temperature close to the melting point. From a statis-
tical point of view, the weakly bonded calcium atom is
likely to evaporate ﬁrst. In addition the situations where
calcium is fully solvated are less probable. Therefore the

true volume melting transition occuring with full solva-
tion of calcium may hardly be observed.

Provided that one could size-select these clusters, we
have shown in the present work that spectroscopy can
possibly probe their phase changes. More generally, in-
tricate ﬁnite size eﬀects in the thermodynamical behavior
could be expected to be seen, as in CaAr13, CaAr30 or
CaAr37. In these special clusters, coexisting isomers and
multiple phase-likes induce complex variations of the ab-
sorption properties with increasing temperature.

Even with experimental setups involving selected sizes,
another problem may come into play to hinder one from
getting the complex spectroscopic information. All the
above results are supposed to be at thermal equilibrium,
without assuming how this equilibrium state had been
reaching.
In some cases, the relaxation time required
for achieving equilibration may be very long because of
multiple funnels in the energy landscape and kinetic trap-
ping. This has been observed in the Ar38 cluster by Miller
and coworkers,62 where typical timescales of 10 s have
been estimated for the interfunnel transitions at moder-
ate temperatures. Relaxation to equilibrium and time-
dependent absorption spectra will be the subject of the
following article.50

V. CONCLUSION

In this paper, we have investigated some methodolog-
ical and practical aspects of ﬁnite temperature spec-
troscopy in chromophore-doped van der Waals clusters
at thermal equilibrium. Using the harmonic superposi-
tion approach improved with anharmonic perturbation
corrections to the partition function, the basic thermo-
dynamical observables were calculated from samples of
local minima on the energy landscape. The photoabsorp-
tion spectrum was obtained using the recent Gaussian

theory by Wadi and Pollak29 in the harmonic approxi-
mation. These theories were tested and validated on se-
lected CaArn clusters, in both the classical and quantum
regimes, at low or moderate temperatures. Although an-
harmonic corrections could also be incorporated to the
various quantities (line shifts and widths) in this theory,
we found them unnecessary in the present work because
of the other underlying approximations.

We have studied the possible spectroscopic signatures
of the various isomerizations and phase changes in CaAr6,
CaAr10, CaAr13, CaAr30, CaAr37, CaAr54, and CaAr146.
The two smaller clusters show relatively simple isomer-
izations leading to a similar spectroscopic signature with
a clear three- to one-peak pattern. Both CaAr30 and
CaAr37 display strong (non monotonic) ﬁnite-size eﬀects
and solid-solid transitions. In CaAr13, melting involves
the calcium atom taking place of one argon atom in the
icosahedral shell. In contrast with most other sizes, it is
associated with the appearance of a new absorption peak.
In CaAr54 and CaAr146, preliminary surface melting oc-
curs at nearly 30 K, and is reﬂected in the absorption
spectrum. In all these phenomena, the local environment
of calcium changes rather abruptly, resulting usually in
clear shifts in some absorption peaks. Volume melting
towards a calcium atom fully solvated by argon has a po-
tentially signiﬁcant spectral signature, however calcium
is less bound to argon than argon itself, hence it is likely
to dissociate before volume melting occurs. One should
mention that the main heat capacity peak indicates melt-
ing of the argon cluster host, especially for large sizes.
While the host cluster is liquidlike the calcium is still
free, to some extent, to glide over the cluster surface.
Being in this state, the rearrangements inside the argon
cluster have little impact on the global spectroscopy of
the chromophore, and the system can be expected to be-
have as a pseudo diatomics Ca–Arn. This point will be
examined further in the third paper.66

→

The techniques used here are valid in both the quan-
tum and classical regimes, which refers to the limit
0. They could be applied to other chromophore-
¯h
doped van der Waals clusters, provided that potential
energy surfaces are built ﬁrst. In particular, neon clusters
could be proﬁtably investigated using the superposition
method and the Gaussian theory of absorption. For he-
lium, the harmonic approximation may break down, and
even anharmonic corrections should be unsuﬃcient. In
this case, quantum Monte Carlo should be coupled with
on-the-ﬂy histogram accumulation to compute the spec-
trum. More generally, the present methods are relevant
to any statistical driven absorption spectrum in hetero-
geneous or homogeneous polyatomic molecules. For in-
stance, the thermal eﬀects on the absorption spectrum
in small sodium clusters20,63 could be investigated using
appropriate models.64,65 As concerns the approximations
within the Gaussian theory, the most questionable point
is the short-time expansion in the autocorrelation func-
tion. This approximation could be overcome using the
formal results of Yan and Mukamel.40 Unfortunately, this
method involves a heavy numerical eﬀort in the context of
multiple isomers, and it still assumes harmonic forces. Fi-
nally, the superposition approximation provides a frame-
work to study time-dependent properties over long time
scales not available to molecular dynamics, by solving
appropriate master equations.67 The application of this
technique to photoabsorption spectra will be made in the
next paper of this series.50

APPENDIX: PERTURBATION EXPANSION OF
THE PARTITION FUNCTION

The ground state Hamiltonian is written in cartesian
coordinates P, R as H(P, R) = Ha(P, R) + δV (R),
where Ha is the harmonic term and δV the extra, anhar-
monic contribution. The Taylor expansion of δV near the
minimum R0 contains products of at least 3 coordinates.

the same terms as the corresponding classical expansion.
This approximation is actually correct from the quantum
point of view as long as we keep it to ﬁrst order. How-
ever, the rigorous perturbation treatment, which should
be performed with path integrals, will not allow us to
obtain the simple corrections that can be compared with
the classical expressions of Ref. 39. Thus we write in a

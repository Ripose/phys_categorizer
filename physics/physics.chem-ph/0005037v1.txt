Abstract

We discuss the variety of coordinates often used to characterize the coherent state clas-
sical limit of an algebraic model. We show selection of appropriate coordinates naturally
motivates a procedure to generate a single particle Schr¨odinger hamiltonian which, for low
energy states, gives equivalent results to a bosonic algebraic model to leading order in N.
The process is used to study the associated geometries of the dynamical symmetries of U(3).
By demanding that the inner product be preserved in the Schr¨odinger picture we conclude
that diﬀerent dynamical symmetries correspond to diﬀerent scales.

1 Introduction

Recently, hybrid algebraic-Schr¨odinger approaches for the study of transition intensities in
molecules have been introduced [1–3]. In these approaches one relies on Schr¨odinger/algebraic
correspondences to introduce operators in the algebra which are functions of conﬁguration
space parameters. For the U(2) model considered in [1,2] one does so by relying on corre-
spondences between a particular dynamical symmetry and a Schr¨odinger Hamiltonian [4].
For more complicated algebras such correspondences are not available. Further, the inner-
product of two algebraic states is not equal to the Schr¨odinger inner-product of their images.
Since, in some circumstances, the inner-product of the algebra has a natural interpretation
as a Schr¨odinger overlap [5] such shortcomings are an impediment to understanding molec-
ular structure.

It would therefore be useful to have a generic correspondence —independent of a par-
ticular dynamical symmetry— for the interpretation of algebraic parameters as geometric
quantities which reside in conﬁguration space (which is noticeably absent in the algebraic
models). We provide such an interpretation by exploiting the many approximate correspon-
dences between algebraic and Schr¨odinger pictures. We demonstrate how one may turn
an algebraic hamiltonian into a traditional Schr¨odinger (traditional meaning kinetic plus
potential—with no coordinate dependent mass terms) single particle hamiltonian which
will give the same results to leading order in N, the label for the symmetric representation
of the algebra. Our procedure is most similar to the re-quantization used by [6] to study

1

spectra. We proceed further to study the wavefunctions and inner product. Our approach
diﬀers from other studies which have examined the correspondence between algebraic and
Schr¨odinger inner products [7] since they rely on particular dynamical symmetries. We work
out our procedure explicitly for U(3) and conclude that diﬀerent chains correspond not only
to diﬀerent geometries but diﬀerent scales.

2 Algebraic Models: Constructing a Connection with

Conﬁguration Space

Numerous correspondences between algebraic and Schr¨odinger methods and their classical
limits can be succinctly summarized in the following simple diagram:

Hamiltonians on the right hand side are written in terms of geometric parameters whereas
those on the left are written in terms of algebraic ones. Thus, a careful exploitation of the
horizontal correspondences should relate the diﬀerent parameters. We propose to do so by
travelling counter-clockwise around the diagram—re-quantizing the algebraic model.

The vertical correspondences are extremely well deﬁned and have been thoroughly dis-
cussed in the literature [6,8–11]. The relationship between the U(n) ⊃ U(n − 1) and the
simple harmonic oscillator (SHO) has also been discussed [12] and can be formalized by
considering the contraction limit of the algebra [13,3]. Similarly, if one ﬁnds appropriate
coordinates in a patch of the coherent state phase space (CSPS) one may embed this region
within a standard phase space and have a perfect copy of the dynamics for local trajectories
[14].

The horizontal correspondences are approximate on the whole given that the phase
spaces are topologically diﬀerent (compact versus non-compact) in the classical regimes and
one has a ﬁnite versus inﬁnite dimensional Hilbert space in the corresponding quantum cases.
However, with careful selection of coordinates it will be seen that these incompatabilities
will not eﬀect the lower bound states in a re-quantization scheme.

It is to the selection of these coordinates we now turn. We must ﬁnd coordinates in
a patch of CSPS which behave like positions and momenta and then identify these as
coordinates covering the entire canonical phase space. In the language of geometry, we wish

2

to ﬁnd coordinates in which the symplectic form determining the dynamics is in Darboux
form: ω = dp ∧ dq [14]. Historically, it has been useful to think of the imaginary part of
the coherent state parameter α as a momenta [12,6]. We adopt that convention here to
eliminate any remaining coordinate choice ambiguity.

Examining the action in the propagator path integral [11,6]: one ﬁnds that the classical

hamiltonian is given by the coherent state expectation, H = hα| ˆH|αi; |αi = 1√N !
α · τ†)N|0i denotes the coherent state in group coordinates [8]; σ and τ are typically scalar
and tensor operators of O(3) respectively; and the hamiltonian evolution is determined by
the symplectic form ω = i¯hdhα|d|αi which in group coordinates is explicitly:

(√1 − α · α∗σ†+

Deviating slightly from the typical development we let

ω = Ni¯h dα∗µ ∧ dαµ.

αµ = s mω

(

),

(2.2)

(2.3)

where q and p are now dimensionful quantities and mω has units of length over momentum
and has the physical interpretation of the ratio of the natural distance and momenta scales of
the problem (see appendix A). In these coordinates the symplectic two-form is in standard
Darboux form ω = dpµ ∧ dqµ, or equivalently {q, p}PB = 1 .
We have been extremely explicit in order to contrast our choice with those of the litera-
ture. For instance in the coordinates of [6] {˜q, ˜p}PB = N. This point is obfuscated because
the correct equations of motion are maintained by dividing the classical action (and hence
ω) by N. Such a procedure, however, leads to improper quantization. Similarly in terms
of the projective coordinates [8] used to establish algebraic-geometric correspondences in
such references as [15,12] one has {˜q, ˜p}PB = N(1 + ˜q2 + ˜p2)2. Thus only near the domain
˜p2 + ˜q2 ≈ 0 is it suitable to interpret these coordinates as the natural coordinates of a
cotangent bundle over conﬁguration space.
Classical Hamiltonians obtained from our coordinates usually have contributions such
as p4
r and p2
r r2. This leads to canonical quantization ordering ambiguities as well as higher
degree diﬀerential equations. However, if we focus on the lowest bound states we may
use an approximate hamiltonian which is valid in the classical regions whose paths most
greatly contribute to these states. In the spirit of the stationary phase approximation, the
appropriate region would be near the ﬁxed point of the hamiltonian ﬂow, i.e. where dH = 0.
Fortunately, since the CSPS limit of algebraic hamiltonians typically have a convenient
momenta dependence, i.e. H = p2
r, r2) + Veﬀ(r), this condition implies we are looking
in the region of reduced phase space near pr = 0 and r = r∗ where V ′eﬀ(r∗) = 0. These
conditions are eminently reasonable.

rf (p2

Near this region the dynamics can be given by approximating the hamiltonian:

H(pr, r) ≈ H|pr=0,r=r∗ +

r(cid:17) ,
2 (cid:16)V ′′eﬀ(r∗)(r − r∗)2 + H12|p=0,r=r∗p2

(2.4)

where all other lower order terms vanish. Hence, at least locally around the ﬁxed point of
the system, our ordering ambiguities are resolved. If r∗ is suﬃciently far from the r = 0
phase space boundary one can sensically re-quantize.

1√N

Given our coordinate choice each higher derivative in the taylor expansion of H in
. Thus this approximation may be considered
equation 2.4 will be down by a factor of
as an expansion in large N. Note, however that this procedure is distinct from other ‘large
N’ techniques such as the contraction limit [13, 3]. Indeed, we will see in section 3.2 that
this procedure, in the speciﬁc instance for Hamiltonians with the dynamical symmetry
U(n) ⊃ U(n − 1), essentially reproduces the contraction limit results.
We have carried out this discussion in a reduced phase space with a radial coordinate.
That is, due to O(3) invariance the ﬁxed point is not a true minima in the global phase
space. In instances where one has a true ﬁxed point in the global phase space (e.g. when
the minima is at r = 0) a similar procedure applies.

The introduction of the scales in equation 2.3 appears arbitray. However, since we desire
a generic correspondence which preserves the inner product structure of the algebra in the
Schr¨odinger picture, once a scale is picked for one Hamiltonian it must be ﬁxed for others,
i.e. any scale change would inﬂuence the overlap of eigenstates which should be equated
with the inner product of the representation. Thus, the scale for each hamiltonian must be
functionally related to the scale of another. If the relationship is not trivial mω may depend
on the parameters within the hamiltonian. This dependence of the scale ratio, mω, will be
suppressed until such subtleties must be considered, at which time we will supplement our
notation with subscripts.

3 An Explicit Example: U (3)

3.1 Coherent State Limit

The algebraic approach for 2D problems was presented by [16]. One considers symmetric
representations of u(3) realized with the two chains of interest:

U(3) ⊃ U(2) ⊃ O(2)
U(3) ⊃ O(3) ⊃ O(2)

I
II

.

(3.1)

We use the same notation as [16] for the generators. However, we select a diﬀerent O(3)
subgroup which is generated by ˆR+, ˆR−, and ˆl. Our choice introduces more ‘coordinate like’
terms of the classical Hamiltonian. The choice makes no diﬀerence for spectra and only an
overall phase for FC overlaps [17]. Please note that the O(3) group is a dynamical symmetry
subgroup and does not have the interpretation of a rotation in conﬁguration space.

The general Hamiltonian of a U(3) model is

H = ǫ ˆn + δ ˆn(ˆn + 1) + β ˆl2 − A ˆW 2,

(3.2)

where ǫ, δ, and A are taken as positive or 0. Setting A = 0 (ǫ = δ = 0) gives a Hamilto-
nian with dynamical symmetry I (II). The basis corresponding to chain I is labeled by the

4

eigenvalues of ˆn and ˆl respectively. The basis corresponding to chain II is labeled by the
eigenvalues of ˆW 2 = 1

ˆR+) + ˆl2 and again ˆl.

Taking the appropriate expectations one may calculate the classical limits of the various

2( ˆR+ ˆR− + ˆR−

operators. The results are enumerated in Table 1.
We reduce the phase space in the natural way:

implying

qx = r cos θ

qy = r sin θ

px = pr cos θ − pθ r sin θ py = pr sin θ + pθ r cos θ,

q · q = r2,

p · p = p2

(3.6)

(3.7)

which we immediately recognize as a multiple of a 2D circular oscillator with energy levels
spaced by ∆E = ǫ [18]. This result perfectly agrees with direct algebraic evaluation.

We proceed similarly for δ diﬀerent from 0. The classical Hamiltonian is then of the

form:

In Cartesian coordinates the conditions for a ﬁxed point are:

H = N(ǫ + 2δ)ncl + δN(N − 1)(ncl)2.

(3.8)

(3.9)

dpy(cid:17) ,

dH = 0 = N[ǫ + 2δ + 2δ(N − 1)ncl]

∂x dx + ∂ncl

∂y dy + ∂ncl

∂px

dpx + ∂ncl
∂py

×(cid:16) ∂ncl

which is true at x = y = px = py = 0 (hence our use of Cartesian as opposed to radial
coordinates). Near this point to second order our Hamiltonian behaves like:

H ≈ N(ǫ + 2δ)ncl.

5

(3.10)

Re-quantization proceeds exactly as in the previous case leading to an energy spacing of
∆E ≈ ǫ + 2δ. The corresponding algebraic Hamiltonian (H = ǫˆn + δˆn(ˆn + 1)) has spacing
for the lowest levels of ∆E = ǫ + 2δ .
Additionally the same low energy eigenfunctions diagonalize both U(2) Hamiltonians in
both the algebraic and approximate re-quantizing prescriptions (i.e.
in both prescriptions
the inner-product of the lowest eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonain with δ = 0 and δ 6= 0 is
1).

3.3 Radially Displaced Oscillators—Near the O(3) Chain

In the situation where our Hamiltonian is near the O(3) dynamical symmetry the ﬁxed
point of the Hamiltonian ﬂow is not at r = 0.

The potential is given by:

Veﬀ(r) = mω

r4i ,

(3.11)

where we have made the deﬁnitions X = ǫ + 2δ + β, Y = δ (N − 1), and Z = 4A (N − 1).
The physically interesting regime [5] is ‘near’ the O(3) chain, i.e. X
Z are both small.
In this limit it is easy to ﬁnd a perturbative solution for the condition V ′eﬀ(r∗) = 0 :

(3.12)

where now it is clear that the presumption that r∗ is large depends on N being large. Note
that having X or Y diﬀerent from 0 decreases r∗. That is, the O(3) chain represents the
maximum possible displacement. r∗ may increase with increasing l however, corresponding
to a larger angular momentum barrier.

Since l can be as large as N we regard l2/N 2 as an independent quantity—even though
in practice it is of the same order as terms which go 1/N 2. In anticipation of this we dropped
the term going with l2

N 4 for simplicity.

l

When one moves slightly oﬀ the O(3) chain diﬀerent l subspaces which were degenerate
split resulting in the lowest energy diﬀerence, ∆E, having a slight l dependence. As we’ve
seen this dependence has entered in lowest order in the form of terms l2
N 2 . Since the ratio
N can be regarded as a separate independent small quantity ignoring terms like O( 1√N
)
does not mean we loose all l dependence in our calculation. Our results for the energy
level spacing will only be correct to leading order in N. The l space splitting behavior will
be given correctly—but the actual values of the splitting will be insigniﬁcant compared to
other (non-l dependent) contributions we have ignored for smaller l.

Continuing we see:

Near the ﬁxed point the Hamiltonian’s behavior is given by equation 2.4. However, the
radial quantum mechanics depends crucially on the point r = 0. Since equation 2.4 does not
reproduce the original Hamiltonian’s behavior near this point the approximation becomes
suspect. It would be more reasonable to quantize:

1

Hpr

2|p=0,r=r∗p2

r + ˜V (r),

(3.15)

where ˜V (r) has the same behavior near the ﬁxed point as the approximate Hamiltonian and
the behavior near r = 0 of the original Hamiltonian. That is:

V ′′eﬀ(r∗)(r − r∗)2 + O((r − r∗)3).

(3.16)

(3.17)

Additionally, of course, ˜V should not introduce any other minima at other locations.

Following the prescription for the harmonic oscillator we use the radial quantization

scheme (equation 3.6), substituting for the wavefunction, Ψ = ψ√r , we obtain:

where ψ(0) = 0 and ψ(r → ∞) = 0. The form of this equation is that of a 1-D Schr¨odinger
equation except the left boundary condition is applied at r = 0. At this point the r ≈ 0
dependence of ˜V becomes crucial. Since ˜V blows up more quickly than the counter term
blows down the sum of the two still has a minima, although it should be shifted inward
from r∗. Calling the new minima r∗∗ = r∗(1 − ǫ) and using our knowledge of the behavior
of ˜V near r∗ we ﬁnd that the condition d

(3.19)

This can be expanded in N with leading contribution O( 1
N 2 ). Recalling that N essentially
counts the number of bound states (hence eﬀectively measures the depth of the potential) it
is reasonable that 1
N 2 should parameterize ǫ. Of course, since we are only working in leading
order in N we have ǫ ≈ 0 and consequently r∗∗ ≈ r∗. Our primary intent of displaying
equation 3.19 is that the condition of N being large is now clariﬁed. Since the prefactor
must be small we ﬁnd 2N ≫ 1.
Returning to equation 3.18 we notice that in our approximation (r∗ or r∗∗ is large) a
solution with the left boundary condition at r = −∞ will, to a good approximation, satisfy
the boundary condition at r = 0. In this instance the lower eigenvalues are given by E ≈ ¯hω

compared to the exact algebraic expression:

∆E = A [N(N + 1) − (N − 2)(N − 1)] = A(4N − 2),

(3.22)

which agrees to leading order in N as advertised.

Note, that the ‘concavity’ corrections depend explicitly on the algebraic parameters, in-
dicative of the fact that our calculations have established relationships between algebraic
Hamiltonians and the geometry of conﬁguration space.

Equations 3.23 and 3.12 for the harmonic dilatation and radial displacement can be
easily related to experimental data and provide useful assistance when analyzing transition
intensities as to be detailed in the upcoming publication [5].

3.4 Near O(3) to O(3) Inner Product

We wish to calculate the inner-product of eigenstates of a hamiltonian corresponding to
slightly oﬀ O(3) symmetry to one on O(3). In either case the approximate wavefunctions
are:

(3.24)

where we have normalized it on the interval [−∞,∞] (as opposed to [0,∞]) as this only
introduces errors of order 1
N . The parameters α and r∗ are determined by 3.23 and 3.12. We
use α′ and r∗′ as the parameters of the wavefunction exactly on the O(3) chain (determined
by the same equations except X = Y = 0). Note that there is an l dependence hidden in
both r∗ and α.

Since both wavefunctions are essentially 0 for r < 0 we may again calculate the overlap

on the interval [−∞,∞]. Thus we wish to evaluate the integral
φ(α; r − r∗)φ(α′; r − r∗′)dr,

I0,0 ≈ Z ∞

(3.25)

where φ is the ground state wavefunction of a 1D SHO. The integral is easily evaluated to

As stated previously the ratio of scales mω need not be the same in both scenarios and may
indeed depend on the value of X,Y , and Z. However, this dependance must be smooth.
Since the diﬀerence between these two scenarios is perturbative one concludes that mω
mω′ =
1 + δ where δ ∼ O(X/Z, Y /Z). Given this, we have:

This is the exact overlap one would expect from perturbation theory of the algebraic model
as spelled out in Appendix B.

3.5 O(3) to U (2) Inner-Products

Given equation 3.27, to our order the overlaps from a hamiltonian near O(3) to the U(2)
chain should be exactly the same as the exact O(3)-U(2) factors.

For the U(2) chain we have the ground state wavefunction [18]:

3.6 Scale Changes

Comparing the analytic expression of the U(2)/O(3) overlaps (equation 3.32 calculated by
approximately requantizing) and the expression from appendix equation B.5 (calculated by
direct algebraic means) ﬁxes the scale dependance. Comparing the exponential dependance
of the two expressions,

Calculating the inner product of the eigenstates of an algebraic hamiltonian on the U(2)
chain with the eigenstates of another hamiltonian oﬀ of the U(2) chain is not simply analo-
gous to the overlap of radially displaced oscillators, but analagous to the matrix elements of
an operator which radially displaces and dilatates (much like the operator matrix elements
calculated in [1]) changing the natural scale of the problem. The degree of dilatation de-
pends on the proximity of the second hamiltonian to either chain. For chains near U(2) the
dilatation paramater is essentially 1. As one moves nearer to the O(3) chain the dilatation
parameter increases, approaching the value given by equation 3.39. This has considerable
consequences for hybrid algebraic-Schr¨odinger analysis of molecules [5].

4 Conclusions

We have provided a procedure, via requantization, to convert a hamiltonian of an algebraic
model into a Schr¨odinger hamiltonian which will give the same results for the lower states
to leading order in N. The procedure is optimized for algebras which are interpreted as
single particle hamiltonians. Thus, it seems most applicable to molecular models such as the
vibron model U(4) [21], the anharmonic oscillator U(2) [4], and the two dimensional U(3)
model considered here. Although the prescription should generate Schr¨odinger hamiltonians
in other models it remains to be seen whether or not such results would have appropriate
many-body interpretations.

We have carried out the requantization process in detail for the limiting cases of the
U(3) model. By demanding that the wavefunction overlap of the requantized system agree
with the inner product of the algebraic model we have demonstrated that diﬀerent chains
of the U(3) model correspond to not only diﬀerent geometries but diﬀerent scales.

A Scales in the Schr¨odinger Picture

Consider a traditional Schr¨odinger Hamiltonian (1-D for simplicity),

d2
dx2 + V0f ( ¯αx),
with the distance scale ¯α and momenta scale given by ¯α

H = −

¯h2
2m

mω = (mV0)− 1
2 .

We on occasion refer to the induced harmonic dilatation constant—which we deﬁne as
the distance scale (dilatation constant of the wavefunctions) one obtains by approximating
2 x2 and V0 = mω2
the potential about a minimum to second order. For a SHO f (x) = 1
¯α2 .
In this instance mω = mω and we deﬁne the distance scale ¯α2 = mω
¯h . If x∗ denotes the
minimum of a more complicated potential we see that the distance scale associated with its
harmonic approximation is

(A.1)

(A.2)

α2 =

mω

¯h qf′′( ¯αx∗).

The induced scale depends on two quantities: (1) the ratio of the true distance and momenta
scales; (2) the concavity of the potential about the minima.

to the hamiltonian with ǫ = δ = β = 0 in the limit where A is large. We may work within
subspaces of constant l so that there are no degeneracies.

We denote the basis from the O(3) chain by |[N], ω, li where ω(ω + 1) is the eigenvalue
of ˆW 2. The U(2) chain basis is denoted by |[N], n, li analogously. We denote the transfor-
mation matrix between them by ζ, i.e. |[N], ωi = Pn ζ ω
n|[N], ni, where we have suppressed
the implicit l dependance.
The wavefunction for the ground state may be perturbatively calculated to ﬁrst order:

|[N], Elowi ≈ |[N], ω = Ni + Xω′6=N |[N], ω′iPn(ζ ω′

As always in perturbation theory, to ﬁrst order in 1

A the wavefunctions only have correc-
tions orthogonal to the unpeturbed wavefunction. Consequently the overlap from a slight
deformation oﬀ the O(3) chain to the O(3) chain is identically 1 to this order.

We now concentrate on the overlap between the O(3) and U(2) chains. In this limit we

have:

I0,0 = h[N], n = |l|, l|[N], ω = N, li = ζ ω=N
n=|l|

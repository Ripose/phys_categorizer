Optimization of quantum Monte Carlo wave functions using analytical energy derivatives

(November 6, 2012)

An algorithm is proposed to optimize quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) wave functions based on Newton’s
method and analytical computation of the ﬁrst and second derivatives of the variational energy. This direct
application of the variational principle yields signiﬁcantly lower energy than variance minimization methods
when applied to the same trial wave function. Quadratic convergence to the local minimum of the variational
parameters is achieved. A general theorem is presented, which substantially simpliﬁes the analytic expressions
of derivatives in the case of wave function optimization. To demonstrate the method, the ground state energies
of the ﬁrst-row elements are calculated.

I. INTRODUCTION

Quantum Monte Carlo is a powerful method of solving the Schr¨odinger equation. QMC treats many-body correlation in an
efﬁcient and ﬂexible way, enabling highly accurate studies of atoms, small molecules and clusters.1–3 A high-quality trial wave
function is crucial to the calculation, since the trial function determines the ultimate accuracy one can achieve in variational
Monte Carlo (VMC) and ﬁxed-node diffusion Monte Carlo, and trial function quality dramatically affects the efﬁciency of the
computation.

An algorithm which efﬁciently and reliably optimizes wave functions is a critical tool for VMC calculations. One straightfor-
ward approach for improving the VMC wave function is to perform energy minimization, in which the variational parameters
are altered with the goal of lowering the expectation value of the energy. This approach is complicated in VMC because of the
uncertainties associated with stochastic sampling. In order to determine whether a new set of parameters yields a lower energy
than the current set, one needs to sample a large number of conﬁgurations to ensure that the energy difference between the two
sets of parameters is actually larger than the energy error bars. Correlated sampling methods are frequently performed to improve
the efﬁciency of energy minimization. Typically, the energy is calculated using identical sampling points in conﬁguration space
for two trial wave functions which differ by a single parameter. The process is repeated for each parameter, and steepest-descent
techniques are commonly used for parameter updating.4 This correlated sampling approach requires a signiﬁcant amount of
memory (to store data for every sampling point) and the numerical differentiation ∆E/∆c requires many extra evaluations of
the local energy. For systems with a large number of parameters, numerical evaluation of the required derivatives becomes
computationally intractable. Analytical energy derivative techniques are very seldom used in current VMC calculations. We will
concentrate on this in the following sections.

A successful alternative approach has been developed which focuses on lowering the variance of the local energy,

HΨ/Ψ.5
If the wave function Ψ were the exact ground eigenstate, the local energy would be a constant with a variance of zero. A
major strength of the variance minimization approach is that the quantity to be minimized has a minimum value which is known
a priori (unlike energy minimization). This idea has been implemented in various ways and has recently become a nearly
universal approach in VMC wave function optimizations. Typically, one calculates ﬁrst derivatives of the local energy variance
analytically. Steepest-descent techniques6,7 or a combination of analytic ﬁrst derivatives with approximate expressions for the
second derivatives are then used for wave function variance reduction (a least-squares ﬁt).8–10 Although variance methods have
the remarkable strength of an a priori minimum value of zero, it is much harder to compute the ﬁrst and second derivatives
of the variance analytically compared to variational energy methods. Therefore, approximate analytical derivatives beyond the
ﬁrst-order are used in real calculations, and to our knowledge the validity of these approximations has not been discussed within
the scope of VMC wave function optimization. It is important to point out that the “direction sets” minimum-searching methods,
such as steepest-descent and conjugate gradient are not efﬁcient for wave function optimization in VMC, because these line-
minimization techniques require at least one order of magnitude more evaluations of local energy along the search directions.
Moreover, variance minimization is actually an indirect method, since a smaller variance does not necessarily correspond to a
lower energy, and the main goal of variational methods such as VMC is the lowest possible upper bound to the energy.

b

Correlated sampling can be used (instead of analytic derivatives) to lower the variance of the local energy. One excellent ver-
sion of this idea is known as the ﬁxed-sample method.11 In this approach, the sampling points for the objective function (variance
of the local energy in this case) are ﬁxed during the optimization procedure, which makes it possible to reduce stochastic noise
during the optimization. In addition, it has been observed from a few preliminary calculations that the number of conﬁgura-
tions sufﬁcient for parameter updating does not increase rapidly with system size.11 The use of very complex trial correlation

1

functions has yielded highly accurate energies for a few ﬁrst-row atoms.11,12 However, this ﬁxed-sample procedure can have
problems if the variational parameters affect the nodes, since the density ratio of the current and initial trial wave functions
diverges frequently in the area around the nodes of the trial wave function. Even worse, this density ratio increases exponentially
with the size of the system.13 Although manually setting an upper bound for the weights or introducing a nodeless sampling
probability density function can overcome the singularities in the ﬁxed distribution14, a general and appropriate form for the
positive deﬁnite functions is still unavailable. In addition, the variational energy from ﬁxed-sample calculations can be sensitive
to the choice of reference energy, sample size, and convergence criteria.15

The method we present involves updating the variational parameters to lower the energy expectation value, guided by the force
vectors and Hessian matrix of the variational energy with respect to variational parameters. Generally it converges quadrat-
ically, making it more efﬁcient than the steepest-descent or quasi-Newton techniques employed in the variance minimization
procedure.6,8 In most cases, the best set of parameters can be obtained after only one or two iterations. Beginning with an iden-
tical trial wave function and the same variational parameters, the correlation energies obtained from our method are signiﬁcantly
better than results in the literature.9 With this approach, we also demonstrate the ability to optimize a wave function with a large
number of parameters. All of the data are collected and compared in Section IV.

II. VMC AND OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHM

Variational Monte Carlo allows us to take our physical insights and construct a trial wave function ΨT containing a set of
variational parameters {cm}. The parameters are varied with the goal of reducing the energy expectation value. In VMC, the
true ground state energy is given by the Raleigh-Ritz quotient:

where EL ≡
the density of the trial wave function at α.

HΨT/ΨT is called the local energy and α is a conﬁguration-space point, visited with relative probability Ψ∗

TΨT,

In a bound molecular system with ﬁxed nuclei, the non-relativistic Hamiltonian

has inversion symmetry. (Note that capital letter subscripts refer to nuclei and lower–case letters refer to electrons.) Therefore,
the true ground-state wave function of this class of Hamiltonian can generally be constructed without an imaginary part, i.e.,

In this case, the expectation value of the energy and the ﬁrst derivative of energy with respect to a variational parameter can

be written as

This theorem explains the simplicity of Eq.

(2): the ﬁrst-order change of expectation value with respect to a change of
parameter comes only from the change of wave function and the Metropolis sampling weights, not from the change of the
quantity (e.g. the local energy).

To test the performance of this new analytic energy minimization scheme, a well-known trial wave function,16,9 is used in the

calculations. Explicitly, the trial wave function is expressed as

where D↑ and D↓ are the Hartree-Fock up-spin and down-spin Slater determinants in a converged STO basis set,17 and F is a
positive correlation wave function. The mkI , nkI and okI are taken to be integers. All of the parameters ckI , bI and dI can be
optimized to obtain the lowest energy.

With our method, a conﬁguration size consisting of 200,000 sampling points is normally enough for satisfactory optimization
for the ﬁrst row atoms. Typically, one or two iterations are sufﬁcient for convergence, requiring about ﬁfty CPU hours on a SGI
90 MHz R8000 processor. Electrons are moved one by one with a time step chosen to maintain an acceptance ratio of 80%. In
order to generate one independent sample point, a block size of twenty sequential steps is used.

To make a comparison with the variance minimization method, we choose the same set of nine parameters as Schmidt and
Moskowitz9 with all zeroes as initial values. We also obey their constraints, enforcing the unlike-spin electron-electron cusp
condition and setting bI and dI to unity. The optimized wave function and energy are shown in Tables I and II. The calculated
results with our method are noticeably better for all ﬁrst-row elements, especially for the so-called 2s − 2p near-degeneracy
atoms9,18 Be, B and C. Approximately 10% more correlation energy is recovered by our analytic energy derivative method.

To demonstrate the power of our analytic energy minimization approach more fully, we optimize a forty-two parameter wave
function, starting from the nine-parameter trial function discussed above. We use all terms with m + n ≤ 4 combined with
o ≤ 3, m = n = 0 with o = 4, and all terms with m + n > 4 and m ≤ 4, n ≤ 4 with o = 0. The same cusp, bI and dI
constraints were obeyed.

It is also interesting to note that in a recent VMC calculation for atoms Be, B and C,18 the use of additional Slater determinants
enabled the authors to recover an amount of correlation energy similar to ours. Our current work demonstrates that this 2s − 2p
near-degeneracy effect for the ﬁrst-row atoms accounts for less than 25% of the correlation energy.

In a typical optimization procedure with this energy derivative method, the energy value and its associated error bar decrease
with the ﬁrst (and possibly second) parameter moves. After that, the forces are much smaller than their error bars, indicating a
local minimum. Table III shows an example of the carbon atom.

However, rather than taking all zeroes as initial guess for variation parameters, if we start from Schmidt and Moskowitz’s
optimized wave function, a smaller but still sharp decrease occurs at the ﬁrst iteration. Taking the atom B, for example, after one
iteration, we obtained about 7% more correlation energy.

As one can see from Figs. 1-3, the energy derivatives are much smoother than the energy itself. As a result, it is much easier
to ﬁnd the parameter value which gives dE/dc = 0 than to locate the minimum from energy data alone. As discussed in Section
III, the general theorem of the local value derivatives permits reduction of noise associated with the energy derivatives for a
much more efﬁcient and reliable wave function optimization in VMC.

After the optimization, the Hessian matrix is diagonalized to check the positivity of the eigenvalues. All of the eigenvalues are
positive or small negative numbers. A positive deﬁnite Hessian guarantees all downhill movement to reach a real local minimum.
The negative values are much smaller than their error bars, indicating search directions with tiny positive curvature.

We have explored a new method to optimize wave functions in VMC calculations. This method is a direct application of
energy minimization. It is very efﬁcient, giving quadratic convergence, and it is straightforwardly applicable to systems having
a large number of parameters. In direct comparisons using identical trial wave functions, the current method yields signiﬁcantly
lower energy expectation values than are achieved with variance minimization for all ﬁrst-row atoms.

We provide the theoretical framework to understand the phenomenology and statistics of single-
molecule (SM) signals arising in Surface-Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) under the presence
of so-called electromagnetic hot-spots (HS’s). We show that most characteristics of the SM-SERS
phenomenon can be tracked down to the presence of tail-like (power law) distribution of enhance-
ments and we propose a speciﬁc model for it. We analyze, in the light of this, the phenomenology
of SM-SERS and show how the diﬀerent experimental manifestations of the eﬀect reported in the
literature can be analyzed and understood under a uniﬁed “universal” framework with a minimum
set of parameters.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The possible detection of a Single Molecules (SM) by
Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) has played
an important role in reviving the interest in SERS.1,2
However, most of the evidence originally put forward in
favor of SM-SERS were indirect. For each piece of evi-
dence, one could usually ﬁnd an alternative explanation
that did not require SM-SERS to be real.3 Despite these
problems, the consensus is that SM-SERS is indeed pos-
sible. Although each piece of evidence in favor of SM-
SERS is not a proof in itself, the accumulated body of
evidence from diﬀerent experiments gives, as a whole, a
strong argument that it must be real. There remains
the question however of how to determine, for a given
SERS experiment, whether we are in a regime of single
molecule SERS or not. This is a very important prob-
lem, since the interpretation of many recent SERS exper-
iments rely on the fact that SM-SERS is observed, but
do not provide an unambiguous proof that it is indeed
the case.4,5 One pre-requisite to observe SM-SERS is the
existence of positions of large SERS enhancements, so-
called hot-spots (HS’s) on a SERS substrate. Suitable
HS’s are believed to be formed for example at a junction
between two metallic nanoparticles,6,7,8 and are highly
localized.9 This HS localization makes it very diﬃcult to
design experiments where SM-SERS signals are observed
and unambiguously demonstrated.

The ideal approach would be to take one molecule and
place it precisely at a HS, but there is currently no easy
way of achieving this. Laser forces on the probe molecule
could be an option but it has not yet been demonstrated
experimentally to occur.10 The probe molecule(s) there-
fore adsorb at a random position on the substrate. The
most common approach currently relies on an ultra-low
concentration of analyte, which ensures that one molecule
(at most) will adsorb at the HS and in principle guaran-
tees the single molecule nature of the dectected signals.
This approach presents several shortcomings. Firstly, it
heavily relies on a correct estimate of the surface cover-
age of the analyte. This is often prone to errors, and can

be particularly deceitful for low concentration where wall
adsorption during preparation or contamination can lead
to large errors in the analyte concentration. Secondly,
the probability that the single molecule adsorbs at a HS
(the only place where it can be detected) is very small.
This leads to very unreliable statistics (since most HS’s
are unoccupied) that would not pass even the simplest
tests of statistical conﬁdence. In practice, this approach
may (at best) provide an indication of the presence of
HS’s with single molecule detection capabilities, but is
not suited to carry out systematic SERS experiments us-
ing single molecules. In our opinion, the most convinc-
ing method based on ultra-low concentrations is possi-
bly the one based on Langmuir-Blodgett monolayers, de-
veloped by Aroca and co-workers.11 While suﬀering still
from some of the drawbacks regarding the statistics of
observed intensities, it is one of the methods that oﬀers
the largest degree of control over where the dyes are and
how they are distributed over the sample.

Another possible approach is to use larger analyte con-
centrations to ensure that most HS’s are occupied by one
molecule at least (on average). This approach also has
its drawbacks. Firstly, we need to address the question
of how we know the concentration that is required to
have one molecule at HS’s on average. Secondly, even if
we know the answer to the latter question, we now have
many more molecules at non-HS positions on the sub-
strate. A natural question then arises: How do we know
if the SERS signal is dominated by these many molecules
with a low EF, or by the one at the HS with a large EF?
In many cases, the presence of ﬂuctuations or of a Poisson
distribution of intensities are taken as evidence for SM
signals, and these questions are then ignored.
In fact,
these two questions are strongly intertwined with the EF
distribution. By studying this distribution and its impli-
cation on the statistics of SERS signals, we will show that
these arguments (Intensity ﬂuctuations and Poisson dis-
tributions of intensity) are not always correct and need
to be assessed carefully. An alternative method, which
we recently developed, relies on the simultaneous use of
two distinguishable analytes to answer these questions,
at least experimentally.12 This method is simple to im-

plement and provides a general recipe for proving the
presence of SM-SERS signals under diﬀerent experimen-
tal conditions. Moreover, this technique showed that the
SERS signals from small colloidal clusters in liquids can
be dominated by a few molecules only, even at fairly high
concentration. This conclusion highlights the importance
of the distribution of SERS enhancements in SM-SERS
experiments and it is one of the aims of this paper to
study this connection.

The distribution of enhancements in metallic struc-
tures is relevant to many other techniques exploiting local
ﬁeld enhancements, such as Surface Enhanced Fluores-
cence (SEF) and, to some extent, to plasmonics in gen-
eral. Previous studies have concentrated mainly on the
maximum local ﬁeld enhancements that can be achieved,
in particular at hot-spots. This approach is important,
for example, to understand whether enhancements are
suﬃciently large to observe signals from single molecules.
It is appropriate if one can easily place a molecule ex-
actly at the HS. In most cases, however, molecules are
randomly positioned, and it is therefore equally impor-
tant to study what happens around the HS and with the
overall distribution of enhancements.

We emphasize in this work the connection between
the SM-SERS problem and the distribution of SERS en-
hancement factors (EF’s) on a given substrate. Large
1010) are required to de-
SERS enhancements (
tect a single molecule. There are currently no known
SERS substrates that exhibit such large enhancements
uniformly across the substrate. On the contrary, these
large EFs are believed to occur precisely at HS’s, typ-
ically located in a narrow gap between two metallic
objects.6,7,8 This can for example be at a junction be-
tween two metallic particles, or between a metallic tip
and a metallic substrate in Tip-Enhanced Raman Scat-
tering (TERS) experiments. Within this picture, the HS
covers a small surface area compared to the rest of the
substrate, but exhibits a much higher EF and should
therefore contribute substantially to the signal. We will
here quantify more carefully this assertion and put it in
the context of several claims made in the past in the ﬁeld
of SM-SERS.

The paper is organized as follows: in Sec. II, we study
the SERS enhancement distribution around a single hot-
spot and discuss its main characteristics. The discussion
is based on a representative example, and we propose
a simple analytical model for the enhancement distribu-
tion. In Sec. III, we discuss how the EF distribution may
change depending on the HS characteristics. In all cases,
the main property of the EF distribution around a HS is
its “long-tail” nature. In Sec. IV, we discuss the implica-
tions of these “long-tail” distributions for the statistics of
SERS signals, in particular in the single molecule regime.

II. ENHANCEMENT FACTOR DISTRIBUTION
AT A GAP HOT-SPOT

A. Presentation of the problem

In order to study how the enhancement distribution
may aﬀect the statistics of SERS signals, we ﬁrst need
to ﬁnd the distribution itself in a situation where HS’s
are present and, in particular, in the case of one sin-
gle HS. The strongest HS’s, and therefore the ones re-
quired for SM detection, are believed to be “gap HS’s”,
formed at a junction between two closely spaced metallic
objects.8 We will therefore study a model system of two
closely spaced spherical metallic particles.13,14 This sys-
tem presents a strong HS in between the two particles,
as required, and captures essentially the physics of most
“gap” HS’s, formed by two closely spaced objects. The
conclusions will therefore remain valid for more complex
systems, qualitatively and semi-quantitatively.13,14

This electromagnetic problem can be solved analyti-
cally in 3D following Generalized Mie Theory as devel-
oped in Ref. 15, and the electromagnetic enhancements
can therefore be calculated pseudo-analytically to a high
accuracy. The series and matrices required for its so-
lution were computed numerically, and we checked the
convergence of the solution. The calculated EF’s are
therefore exact. This is important since many of the
approximations used to solve such problems tend to have
problems when estimating the local ﬁeld enhancements,
especially at HS’s. This is because most numerical tech-
niques, such as Finite Element Modelling16,17,18 or the
Discrete Dipole Approximation,19,20,21,22 rely on a dis-
cretization (meshing) of the geometry. This gives satis-
factory results in terms of far-ﬁeld properties (scattering
or extinction), but rapidly face limitations when com-
puting the local ﬁeld at the surface. This is because
of the large ﬁeld gradients existing at a HS, which re-
quire the use of an extremely ﬁne mesh, often resulting
in prohibitively large computational time for 3D simu-
lations. 2D simulations can be useful in understanding
qualitative eﬀects23, but are unlikely to predict realistic
enhancement factors for 3D structures.

The SERS electromagnetic enhancement factors, F (r)
can be calculated at any position from the knowledge
of the local ﬁeld ELoc(r) (the incident ﬁeld amplitude is
denoted E0). It depends in principle on the Raman ten-
sor of the probe, its adsorption geometry, the scattering
geometry (e.g. backscattering), and the energy of the
vibrational mode.24 To avoid unnecessary complications,
4, which is sim-
we use the approximation F
pler, more general, and suﬃcient for our purpose here.
The meaning of this approximation has been discussed
in Ref. 24. We will focus primarily on F , which repre-
sent the electromagnetic SERS enhancement factor, but
it is easy to adapt our results to M = √F , i.e.
local
ﬁeld intensity enhancement, which is important in other
situations, such as enhanced absorption or SEF.

FIG. 1:

problem under consideration: a dimer formed by two sil-
ver particles of radius a = 25 nm and separated by a gap
g = 2 nm, excited by a plane wave polarized along the dimer
axis (z), i.e. α = 0. Any position on the surface of the
bottom particle are deﬁned by standard spherical coordinates
angles θ (measured from the dimer axis) and φ (measured
from the incidence plane). (b) Calculated enhancement fac-
tor F = |ELoc/E0|4 at the surface of the bottom particle
along the dimer axis (i.e. at the hot spot, θ = 0). The res-
onance at λRes = 448 nm is a plasmon resonance resulting
from the dipolar interaction between the two particles. The
other peaks are due to higher order interaction. Note that F
remain large over a wide range of wavelengths.

in a conﬁguration as shown schematically in Fig. 1(a).
The polarization of the incident ﬁeld is aligned along the
dimer axis (α = 0). This is the conﬁguration where the
largest enhancement is predicted at the HS in the gap.
The parameters used are as follows: radius a = 25 nm,
gap d = 2 nm, and the local dielectric function of silver
was used.25 We show in Fig. 1(b) the wavelength depen-
dence of the EF at the HS, i.e. at the surface of one of
the particles along the dimer axis in the gap. The reso-

It would be further red-shifted to
542 nm in water and
even further if the particles were not spheres. This res-
onance is the important one for SERS, and we therefore
choose the excitation to be at λ = 448 nm to study the
EF distribution. The results are largely independent of
this choice, as we shall see later.

≈

Finally, we will only focus in this work on the dis-
tribution of EF’s on the metallic surface. We therefore
study the EF experienced by molecules directly adsorbed
on the surface and ignore any eﬀects of additional layers
of molecule. It is generally believed that this ﬁrst layer
contributes to most of the SERS signal26. Moreover, in
situations of single molecule detection, the concentration
is well below monolayer coverage, hence justifying even
further the choice. Note that we also neglect any chemi-
cal contribution to the SERS enhancement.

We calculated F for positions on the surface deﬁned
by 0
π (see Fig. 1(a)) and various φ (note that the
symmetry of revolution is broken here by the direction of
the wave-vector of the incident beam, so there could be a
φ dependence). Because of the large variation of F , it is
more convenient to characterize the EFs by L = log10 F .
We show the distribution L(θ) in Fig. 2(a) for φ = 0 and
φ = π/2. It is clear that the results are virtually identical,
especially in the region of interest (close to the HS). We
will therefore ignore the φ dependence in the following:
L(θ, φ)
L(θ, φ = 0). We also see in 2(a) a very sharp
increase in the EF as one approaches the HS (θ = 0).
The EF drops by a factor of 10 from θ = 0 to θ = 0.19
rad (11◦). The maximum F in this example is Fmax =
103 for
1.9
θ = π/3. This clearly highlights the huge variation in F
across the substrate, over 7 orders of magnitude here.

From the curve L(θ), we can in principle derive the EF
distribution on the surface, i.e. the probability density
function (pdf) p(F ) that a molecule at a random posi-
tion experiences a given enhancement F (strictly speak-
ing p(F )dF is the probability that the enhancement is
between F and F + dF ). To do so, we need to take
into account the fact that the problem is in 3D with
(approximate) symmetry of revolution. A given θ cor-
responds to a ring on the sphere surface, whose radius
varies with θ. Therefore, if we pick a random position on
the surface, θ is not uniformly distributed, but has a pdf
p(θ) = (1/2) sin θ. The pdf p(F ) for F can be expressed
analytically as a function of F (θ). However, because we
do not have here an analytical expression for F , but only
its value for discrete θ’s, it is easier to determine p(F )
using a Monte-Carlo-type approach. We generate ran-
dom θ according to their probability distribution p(θ)
and for each of them calculate the corresponding F us-
ing a quadratic interpolation of the curve F (θ) around θ.
p(F ) and p(L) are then obtained by drawing a (normal-
ized) histogram of the obtained F and L. Various repre-

FIG. 2: Several representations of the EF distribution on
the surface of one sphere of a dimer. Due to the many or-
ders of magnitude spanned by F , the EF is characterized by
L = log10 F . (a) L as a function of θ for φ = 0 and φ = π/2.
Also shown is the case α = 45◦ where the incident wave comes
at a 45◦ angle with polarization at 45◦ from dimer axis (EF
scaled here by a factor 4, see Sec. III A). The three curves are
nearly identical, especially close to the HS (θ = 0). (b) Prob-
ability distribution function (pdf) of L, p(L), for a random
distribution of molecules on the sphere. p(L) can be derived
from L(θ) taking into account the fact that p(θ) = (1/2) sin θ.
The quantity p(L′ > L) =
L′>L p(L′)dL′ (i.e. 1-cdf , where
cdf is the cumulative distribution function) is also shown. The
distribution is so skewed that the interesting region of large
enhancement (L > 5) can hardly be seen. (c) Same as (b) on
a semi-log scale to highlight the tail of large enhancements.
The ﬁt to the pdf of a truncated Pareto distribution is also
shown (dotted line).

Note that we have to generate a large number of random
θ (107 here) to produce smooth plots because the proba-
bility distribution is very skewed and spans a wide range.

in Fig. 2(a) and it shows that it is completely dominated
by the region close to the HS itself. The EF distribution
shown in Fig. 2(a-c) captures all the important aspects
of SERS enhancement around a single HS and their rela-
tion to statistical ﬂuctuations, as we shall show in what
follows.

i

We will now discuss several general important points.
The main characteristic of the distribution p(F ) is that it
is a so-called “long-tail” distribution. It is similar in some
ways to the Pareto distribution, encountered in many ar-
eas of physics, economy, and social sciences.27 It is often
used as a paradigm to model the wealth distribution in a
society.28 Fig. 2(a-c) actually reveal that SERS enhance-
ments are some sort of an extreme example of a Pareto
distribution (compared with the examples found in so-
cial sciences)28, because the enhancement is completely
dominated by what happens in a very narrow angular
range. We summarize the main characteristics of this
distribution here:

The average SERS enhancement is
which is about 285 times smaller than the maxi-
1010. This means
mum enhancement Fmax = 1.9

tribute as much to the SERS signal as
300 ran-
domly positioned molecules.

For a uniform distribution of molecules on the sur-
face, 80% of the SERS signal originates from only
0.64% of the molecules. These correspond to the
molecules in a small disk-like region around the
HS characterized by an angular spread of θ <
0.16 rad (9◦). An equivalent version of the Pareto
principle28 for our system would be that: on aver-
age, 98% of the SERS signals originates from only
2% of the (randomly) adsorbed molecules.

These considerations have immediate implications
in terms of ﬂuctuations of the signal. If one records
the SERS signal in successive events, each origi-
nating from say 300 randomly adsorbed molecules,
then strong ﬂuctuations are automatically ex-
pected. This is because on average the signal will be

dominated by only 0.64% of these, i.e. 2 molecules.
Fluctuations are therefore bound to arise depend-
ing on where exactly in the HS these two contribut-
ing molecules are adsorbed. We shall return to this
issue later.

•

The distribution has such inequalities that the con-
tribution from molecules far from the HS is always
negligible. Despite the fact that there could be a
large number of them (say 1000 times more than
close to the HS), their enhancement factor is so
small (at least 105 smaller) that their contribution
can be safely ignored.
In other words, the exact
form of the distribution p(L) for say L < 6 has no
impact on most observations.

D. A simple model hot-spot

This last remark is in fact quite useful, because it en-
ables us to model the distribution with analytical expres-
sions with only 3 parameters. First, we see in Fig. 2(c)
that the tail for large L can be well-approximated by a
straight line. This means that:

Using the fact that p(F ) = p(L)/(F ln(10)), this leads to
the empirical formula:

0.135 and A

In our example, we extract k
0.075.
The corresponding ﬁt is shown in Fig. 2(c). This expres-
sion is similar to that of the pdf for a Pareto distribution.
There is a diﬀerence, however, in the value of A because
our distribution does not extend to F
, but has a
maximum value: p(F ) = 0 for F > Fmax, correspond-
ing to the maximum physically achievable enhancement
in the sample. Therefore, it corresponds to a truncated
Pareto distribution (TPD). Under these conditions, we
can approximate the enhancement distribution by a TPD
with 3 parameters: k, A, and Fmax. This distribution is
very accurate for large enhancements L > 5, but not for
lower enhancements (see Fig. 2(c)). We have already em-
phasized, nevertheless, the fact that lower enhancements
have a negligible contribution, so this approximate distri-
bution is in fact excellent for most predictions, regardless
of how the distribution is extended to lower enhance-
ments.

The approach we describe is, in fact, a very general ap-
proach for characterizing SERS enhancements in a sub-
strate containing HS’s. All important physical predic-
tions can be deduced from the value of these three pa-
rameters. The mathematical details of such derivation
are presented in Appendix A. In our example, we have
1010. With these
k = 0.135, A = 0.075, and Fmax = 1.9
parameters, we can (for example) re-derive from Eq.
107.

We now discuss brieﬂy the physical meaning of these
three parameters for a given HS:

5

•

•

•

Fmax simply describes the maximum intensity of
the HS and can be viewed as the “strength” of the
hot spot.
It is the enhancement experienced by
a molecule placed exactly at the right spot. This
needs to be suﬃciently large if SM-signals are to be
detected.

A is an indication of how probable it is for a
molecule to be located at (or close to) the HS. In a
way, A is not really a characteristics of the HS itself
but more of the remaining metallic surface. It is a
representation of the relative area of the HS with re-
spect to the rest of the substrate. In simple terms,
the larger the value of A, the larger the hot-spot
area with respect to the rest. The current descrip-
tion (with a truncated Pareto distribution) would
fail though if A is too large, since the HS would
then not have enough “contrast” in enhancement
with respect to the rest in order to be considered
as a proper hot-spot.

k determines how fast the enhancement decreases
when moving away from the HS. It is therefore (in-
directly) a measure of the sharpness of the reso-
nance (in spatial terms) of the HS. To visualize this,
let us consider for example the number of molecules
experiencing an enhancement F = Fmax/10. These
molecules are all located at the same angle θ from
the HS (which is θ = 0 in Fig. 1(a)), i.e.
they
form a ring around the HS. The number of these
molecules increases with θ. It should also be pro-
portional to p(Fmax/10) = A(10/Fmax)1+k, which
is decreasing with k. When k increases, the cor-
responding ring must then be smaller (i.e. smaller
θ’s), and the spatial resonance is sharper. A larger
k, for the same A and Fmax, therefore corresponds
to a sharper resonance, with larger enhancement
gradients. Note however, that for general values of
k, A and Fmax, the sharpness of the resonance is
better characterized by the value of D given in Eq.
(A7) (large D for sharper resonances).

E. Enhancement Localization

q

It is often stated in the SERS literature that HS’s are
places of highly localized enhancements on the surface.
We can now quantify this assertion using our model HS.
We deﬁne the q-HS (0
1) as the region around the
≤
HS from which a proportion q of the total SERS signal
originates, and denote aq its area relative to the total
surface area. For example, a80% is the relative area on
the substrate from which, on average, 80% of the signal
originates. If the HS is strong and highly localized, then
aq should be small, even for q close to 1 (most of the
signal originates from a very small region). Note that by

III. HOT-SPOT TO HOT-SPOT VARIATION

We have so far focused on describing one single HS.
This approach is relevant to many experimental situa-
tions.
In particular, for SM-SERS studies, the experi-
mental conditions are usually adjusted to achieve exactly
this, a maximum of one HS at a time in the scattering
volume. There are however other situations where the
signals will originate from a substrate containing many
hot-spots, for example in a large colloidal aggregate. In
such conditions, the single HS model is still useful since
the total signal can in a ﬁrst approximation be taken
as the sum of signals from independent hot spots. It is
however necessary to understand how the enhancement
distributions may change from one HS to another. This
study is also necessary to understand series of measure-
ments where one single HS may be measured at any given
time, but not necessarily the same one each time.

A.

Incident polarization eﬀects

The ﬁrst obvious source of variation from one HS to
another is the variation in the orientation of the inci-
dent ﬁeld polarization. It is well known that gap HS’s
are highly uniaxial,14 and optimal enhancements are ob-
tained when the incident ﬁeld polarization matches the
HS axis. In the previous study of our model HS, we as-
sumed that the incident ﬁeld was along the dimer axis,
i.e. optimum coupling. In a more general case, the re-
sults depend on both the incident wave-vector direction
and polarization. In a ﬁrst approximation, the dimer has
a response similar to a dipole13,14, and only the angle α
between polarization and dimer axis is important, intro-
ducing an additional factor cos4 α to the enhancement.

6

Such an example is shown in Fig. 2(a) for α = 45◦.
The corresponding curve F (θ) is nearly identical to that
obtained for α = 0, only scaled by a factor cos4 α = 1/4.
Denoting F0(θ) the EF for α = 0, we then have
F (θ, α) = F0(θ) cos4 α. We assume F0 follows the proba-
bility distribution described previously, a TPD with pa-
rameters k, Fmax, and A. In an experiment where one
single HS with a ﬁxed α is observed, then F follows like
F0 a TPD with the same k, but with Fmax reduced to
Fmax cos4 α, and A to A cos4k α. In many situations, the
angle α is however not ﬁxed. For a random orientation
of the dimer axis, α is also a random variable with prob-
ability p(α) = (1/2) sin α. We can then derive the proba-
bility distribution of F and we ﬁnd that F again follows
a TPD, with the same parameters k and Fmax, but where
A is replaced by A/(1 + 4k).

Overall, the previous arguments show that the incident
polarization eﬀects do not signiﬁcantly change the con-
clusions drawn earlier. The EF distribution still follows a
TPD with the same k parameter. Only small changes to
the other two parameters apply, transforming them into
“eﬀective” parameters averaged over the incident polar-
ization directions.

B. Diﬀerent types of HS

We now brieﬂy study how the distribution may vary
for diﬀerent types of gap HS’s. Within our model gap
HS formed by a dimer, one could expect the distribution
to change with a number of parameters: wavelength λ,
separation (gap) between particles g, radius of particles
a, optical properties of the metal. We carried out calcu-
lations of the EF distributions for various combinations
of these parameters. The ﬁrst observation is that for
all cases studied here, the distribution of EF is always
“long-tail” and extremely well-represented by a TPD (in
the high EF region), as in the example studied previously.
Like in many other cases in SERS, one could argue that
the example of a dimer captures the essence of most high
enhancement situations, irrespective of the details. The
parameters of the TPD for a number of representative
cases are summarized in Table II.

The most interesting aspects of this table are brieﬂy

discussed:

•

•

The main diﬀerence among HS’s appears in the
value of Fmax, which varies by 3-4 orders of mag-
nitude here. However, this variation only reﬂects
a global scaling factor on the whole distribution of
enhancement, not on its shape. For example, the
average enhancement scales by approximately the
same amount.

Fmax describes the strength of the HS and it is
stronger in the following situations: (i) for silver
compared to gold, (ii) when the excitation wave-
length matches the (red-shifted) plasmon resonance
of the dimer, (iii) for smaller gaps, and (iv) for

TABLE II: Example of various gap HS’s formed by two closely-spaced metallic particles excited with a ﬁeld polarized along
the dimer axis. The HS’s characteristics depend on a number of parameters: metal (silver or gold), radius a of each particle,
gap g between particles, and excitation wavelength λ. The (R) after λ indicates that this particular wavelength corresponds
to the plasmon resonance of the dimer (where the maximum enhancements are obtained). The enhancement distribution can
be ﬁtted to a truncated Pareto distribution with parameters k, Fmax, and A. The sharpness and localization can be further
described by the values of D and aq (deﬁned in the text and in Appendix A).

larger curvature around the HS (i.e when a is
smaller). These four aspects manifest themselves
here in the speciﬁc context we are studying, but
are in fact well-known in the general picture of ﬁeld
enhancements in metallic nano-structures.

•

The most remarkable feature, however, is in the
actual distribution of enhancements. The param-
eters k and A do not vary much from one HS to
another, even for relatively large variation of the
gap g, or changing from silver to gold (which leads
to a change from 0.26 to 2.0 in the imaginary part
of the dielectric function ǫ(λ) at the wavelengths
considered here).

To summarize this section, the shape of the enhance-
ment distribution remains in a ﬁrst approximation in-
dependent of the HS characteristics. The HS strength
is therefore the dominant parameter in the variability
from one HS to another. Hence, the considerations of
the previous sections apply to a wide variety of gap HS’s.
The distribution is always extremely skewed (“long-tail”)
with a k parameter in the range
0.18, and is sim-
ply displaced towards the lower or higher enhancements
region depending on the actual strength of the HS. This
conclusion, we believe, will hold for most types of gap
HS’s.

∼

Note ﬁnally that one could consider other types of
HS’s, such as those formed in a groove, or at sharp cor-
ners. These HS’s are not as strong and therefore less
likely to be relevant to SM-SERS studies. The “long-tail”
nature of the distribution will remain, but the parame-
ters could change compared to gap HS’s. These would
require a separate study.

C. Collection of hot-spots

As mentioned before, there are experimental situations
where a large number of HS’s are present. We will not

dwell on this aspect here since it is less relevant to SM-
SERS, but simply make a few general remarks.

In most situations involving a large number of HS’s,
the substrate may be considered as a collection of spa-
tially separated independent single HS’s. The distribu-
tion of EF’s can then in a ﬁrst approximation be obtained
by summing the contribution from these HS’s (i.e. sum-
ming their respective pdf’s). Note however that the HS’s
can come from regions which will have in general diﬀerent
relative areas, and the sum should therefore be weighed
to take this into account. Such a weight factor can mod-
ify the A parameters of the various p(F ). The other main
diﬀerence between the various p(F ) can come from dif-
ferent Fmax, which may vary, say by
4 orders of
magnitude depending on the HS strength, and incident
polarization. In order to be quantitative in such a situa-
tion, one would need to assume a distribution of Fmax’s
and then estimate the sum of the various p(F )’s. If the
Fmax’s are relatively uniform across HS’s, the total EF
distribution will simply resemble that of a single HS with
a k parameter in the range
0.18, as before. If
∼
the Fmax’s vary over several orders of magnitude, then
a decreasing number of HS’s contribute to the distribu-
tion at higher enhancements. This will result in a slight
“bending” of the straight line representing log10 p(L) in
Fig. 2(c) in the region of large L’s. The distribution re-
mains highly skewed and similar to a Pareto distribution,
but this could increase the value of the k parameter in
the region of interest (high enhancements).

IV. STATISTICS OF SERS SIGNALS

We now focus on the consequences of the distribution
of SERS enhancements on the signal statistics. We have
seen that this distribution is always highly skewed when
HSs are present, and can be modelled as a truncated
Pareto distribution in most cases of interest. We will
therefore again use the same example of HS’s as in the
previous section to illustrate our arguments, but the fol-

lowing considerations are fairly general and apply to any
system containing HS’s (and therefore a “long-tail” dis-
tribution of enhancements). It is particularly appropriate
to single molecule SERS experiments, where single HS’s
are usually studied. As before, we consider in the fol-
lowing a model HS, here with Nmol molecules randomly
positioned on the surface. We assume that a series of
SERS measurements is carried out on this system and
analyze the statistics of the SERS signals; a situation
that has been studied experimentally in the context of
SM-SERS in countless opportunities. To the very best of
our knowledge, there has never been a serious attempt to
pin down the physical meaning of the statistics of events
in these experiments by means of a model distribution for
the enhancements at HS’s. The next subsections, there-
fore, present some of the key results of the analysis using
the tools developed so far.

A. Ultra-low concentration

Let us ﬁrst consider the extreme case of Nmol = 1.
Note that in most SM-SERS experiments, it is claimed
that there is indeed less than one molecule at a time in
the scattering volume.1,2 In this case, the SERS signal
from this molecule will only be detected if it is located at
a position of suﬃciently high enhancement F > Ft, i.e.
close to the HS, where Ft depends on the sensitivity of
the detection and the intrinsic scattering properties of the
probe. Let us assume, for example, that only molecules
experiencing an EF of Ft
Fmax/100 or more can be
≈
detected (note that this is a very optimistic estimate).
2.37%, i.e
Then one can see that p(F > Ft) = a99% ≈
a signal will be observed for only 1 event in every 42.
Moreover, the intensity of these events will ﬂuctuate by
a factor of around 100, depending on exactly where the
observed molecule is located in the HS. Using a more real-
istic factor (10 instead of 100), only one SM event in every
100 is detectable. Such a behavior was observed experi-
mentally by Nie et al.1. Only a small proportion of the
colloids were active, i.e. only the ones where the molecule
was by chance at the HS. In the limit of ultra-low con-
centrations, it is then extremely diﬃcult to demonstrate
that the number of detected events scales with concen-
tration due to the worsening statistical signiﬁcance. This
opens the door to alternative explanations based on “rare
events” which are not necessarily SM.

B. Medium concentrations

It is now interesting to study what happens for more
than one molecule on the surface and see whether
the ﬂuctuations can be averaged out by having several
molecules instead of one. A simple approach is to con-
sider a50%, which is the relative area from which 50%
of the SERS signal originates.
If we have on average
only one molecule in this small area (corresponding to

expect substantial ﬂuctuations even for 250 molecules on
the surface. This is simply due to the nature of the en-
hancement distribution.

∼

To understand further the statistics of SERS signals,
we would ideally like to determine the probability distri-
bution of the total intensity of Nmol randomly distributed
molecules. This is a standard problem in probability the-
ory: ﬁnding the pdf of the sum of N random variables
with a known pdf. Unfortunately, there is no simple ana-
lytical expression (to our knowledge) for a sum of random
variables with a truncated Pareto distribution. The easi-
est approach then is to compute numerically a histogram
of SERS intensities for a large number of events of Nmol
randomly distributed molecules. This represents the ex-
pected intensity distribution in an experiment with an
average of Nmol molecules on the surface. Examples of
such intensity distributions are shown in Fig. 3 for our
model HS and various values of Nmol. The x axis in these
histograms shows the intensity normalized with respect

to the number of molecules and to the expected average
signal per molecule
. A value of 1 therefore corre-
i
sponds to the average signal. The smallest and largest
value on the x axis corresponds to the intensities of the
smallest and largest event (if there is only one such event,
the bar in the histogram is too small to be visible).

F
h

We can make a number of remarks on these distribu-

tions:

•

•

•

The distribution remains skewed (“long-tail”) even
for large numbers of adsorbed molecules (at least
500 molecules). Large intensity ﬂuctuations should
therefore be expected in this range. As discussed
before, this is due to the strong localization of the
HS. The observed SERS intensity for 500 molecules
has in fact a strong contribution from the few
molecules (possibly one or two) closest to the HS. It
is therefore not surprising to have ﬂuctuations de-
pending on the exact number and position of these
few molecules. This is probably one of the most
widespread experimental situations in SERS: low
(but not ultra-low) concentrations.

Even for 1000 or 2000 molecules, there is still an
asymmetry in the distribution, i.e a long tail with
a small probability of large events. This should
be viewed as an intrinsic property of any HS-
containing SERS substrate. The Pareto-like distri-
bution of enhancements will always lead to a dis-
tribution of SERS intensities with a high-intensity
tail, similar to a lognormal or Gamma distribution.
This is true even for relatively large numbers of
molecules and would only disappear for extremely
large values (for example Nmol = 7850 in the ﬁg-
ure) where the central-limit theorem prediction of
a Gaussian distribution is recovered.

For small numbers of molecules,
for example,
Nmol = 100, there are many events with intensi-
ties below the detection limit. They correspond to
events where no molecule is close enough to the HS
to experience a suﬃcient enhancement. At such
concentrations, the SERS signals originate essen-
tially from a single molecule (the other 99 have
a much smaller contribution). SM-SERS is there-
fore possible (and in fact much more practical) at
concentrations much larger than typically used in
ultra-low concentration studies. Decreasing further
the concentration, as often done in SM-SERS ex-
periments, will only decrease the probability of SM-
SERS events and make the analysis more diﬃcult
and the statistics unreliable. The only issue at in-
termediate concentrations is to be able to prove
that the signals are indeed SM signals. A bi-analyte
technique as described in Ref. 12, or an equivalent
method, must then be used to verify the SM nature
of the signals.

strates with HS’s.
It is important to realize that they
are not only a consequence of the variability of the SERS
substrates itself. Even in a solution of exactly identical
metallic dimers for example, ﬂuctuations will arise for
Nmol < 1000 molecules per colloids simply as a result of
the random adsorption combined with the highly skewed
(“long-tail”) distribution of SERS enhancements. Inten-
sity ﬂuctuations alone cannot be invoked as a proof of
SM-SERS.

It is interesting to see whether it is possible to minimize
or eliminate these ﬂuctuations. If one could have a large

An interesting question is how many molecules we need to
remove the ﬂuctuations. We could try to use the central
limit theorem to answer this question but the distribution
is so skewed that it may not apply except for very large N
(slow convergence); a property that is clearly hinted at in
Fig. 3. If it did apply, it would tell us that for suﬃciently

highly unusual nature of distribution we are dealing with
for HS’s.

Now it is worth remembering that in SERS, we can-
not in general have as many molecules as we want on a
substrate’s surface. If we assume that only the ﬁrst layer
is active26, then the maximum number of molecules de-
pends on the surface area of one molecule compared to
that of the whole substrate. If we consider molecules with
1 nm2 (reasonable for dyes), and
surface coverage of
our model HS, which has a total surface of S = 7850 nm2,
then Nmax is of the order of 8000. The ﬂuctuations are
then reasonably small but still present (see Fig. 3(f)).
Moreover, for many dyes in colloidal solutions, the max-
imum concentration can be limited by induced aggrega-
tion of colloids and ﬂuctuations may then be unavoidable,
even for the largest allowed concentrations. The SERS
ﬂuctuations can then be viewed as an unavoidable (and
natural) consequence of the long-tail distribution of en-
hancements around HS’s.

D. How to interpret “Poisson distributions of
SERS intensities”?

It is clear from these examples that intensity ﬂuctu-
ations are an intrinsic property of SERS in most sub-

A Poisson distribution of SERS intensities is often put
forward as an argument for SERS SM-signals.2,29,30 It

One could argue that there is a saturation mecha-
nism, for example photo-bleaching of the molecule,
which guarantees that every single molecule emits
more or less the same signal before being destroyed.
However, the photo-bleaching mechanisms under
SERS conditions are still not well understood and
it is not clear whether it would result in such a
perfect saturation of the SERS signal from a sin-
gle molecule (which follows a diﬀerent enhancement
factor than absorption or ﬂuorescence).

Even in the presence of a suitable saturation mech-
anism, the concentration inferred from the Pois-
son distribution would be much smaller than the
experimental molecular concentration. This is be-
cause of the strong spatial localization of the HS:
the chances of a molecule being at a HS are small,
and the molecule is undetetectable if it is outside
the HS.

If the concentration inferred from the Poisson dis-
tribution matches the experimental concentration,
as in Ref.
2, then it means that every single
molecule is adsorbed at the HS. This is very un-
likely in general. It has been suggested that laser
forces attracting the molecule towards the HS’s10,31
could provide an additional mechanism to improve
the chances of seeing molecules at HS’s, but this
remains very speculative at the moment. In most
studied situations it will be the surface chemistry
and molecular interaction of the molecule with the
surface that determines the way the analyte is
spread over the surface.

∼

We here propose a simpler, and arguably more cred-
ible, interpretation of these Poisson distributions. Let
us ﬁrst note that they are always obtained from a small
number of events, 100 in general.2,29,30 It is in fact a prop-
erty of long-tail distributions that most random samples
of
100 events exhibit peaks similar to a Poisson distri-
bution. This is true for any long-tail distributions, such
as lognormal distributions or those shown for example in
500. To illustrate this, we show in
Fig. 3(a-c) for Nmol ≤
Fig. 4 an example of the SERS intensities of 100 events
for 200 molecules randomly distributed on the surface,
along with a “Poisson” ﬁt to the data. This ﬁt is mis-
leading, because it is only a result of the poor sample
size used for the histograms (100 events). In fact, when
using 10000 events, we simply obtain the histogram of
Fig. 3(b), which is a “standard” long-tail distribution.
This type of “Poisson” ﬁts is therefore not a proof of
SM-SERS, but rather illustrates the wide range of en-
hancements in a typical SERS experiments with HS’s
and is another manifestation of the peculiar nature of
the distribution present in this problem.

ports on SM-SERS.2 It is in general argued that the peaks
in the Poisson distribution are a result of seeing none
(background signal), one, two, or three molecules during
a given SERS event. The average number of molecules
can then be inferred from the relative intensities of these
Poisson peaks. The conditions for this argument to be
true have not been emphasized enough in our opinion:

•

The argument is only valid if each single molecule
gives exactly the same SERS signal (within less
than a factor of 2 to diﬀerentiate between one
strong molecule and two weak molecules). This
is highly unlikely in SERS for many reasons: non-

We brieﬂy discuss here two additional eﬀects re-
lated to the enhancement distribution:
vibrational
pumping32,33,34,35,36,37,38 and photo-bleaching under
SERS conditions.

We have recently proposed a clear demonstration
of the existence of vibrational pumping under SERS
conditions.37,38 This eﬀect can in principle be used to
extract the SERS cross-section of the analyte, and there-
fore the SERS enhancement. For a non-uniform distri-
bution of enhancements, we have shown37,38 that what

argued that it was a good (under)estimate of the max-

distribution of enhancement, we can give a more accu-
rate estimate. Using Eq.
(A8) and the fact that k is
small, we deduce that the pumping enhancement, Fp, is
approximately a factor of
2 smaller than the maximum
enhancement.

Another phenomenon where the distribution of en-
hancement is likely to play an important role is photo-

photo-bleaching, the number of molecules (and therefore
the intensity) decays as n(t) = n0 exp(
Γt) where the
decay rate Γ depends on the laser intensity, in a ﬁrst
approximation as Γ = βIL. The mechanisms of photo-
bleaching under SERS conditions are still not well re-
solved, but it is reasonable to assume that Γ will also
depend on the enhancement factor F experienced by the
molecule. Two simple assumptions are Γ(F ) = βF IL
(proportional to SERS EF), or Γ(F ) = β√F IL (propor-
tional to absorption or local ﬁeld intensity enhancement).
This dependence would result in both cases in a non-
exponential decay of the SERS intensity, which can be
estimated from:

This equation in fact provides a starting point for using
photo-bleaching as a way of measuring EF distributions
experimentally. Combined with theoretical estimations
of EF distributions, it also provides a chance of study-
ing the photo-bleaching mechanism itself, i.e. determin-
ing the dependence Γ(F ) and its physical origin. As an
example, for a TPD as considered here, the expected
decay of I(t) (for long times) are approximately power
laws scaling as 1/t1−k if Γ(F ) = βF IL or as 1/t2−2k if
Γ(F ) = β√F IL.

V. CONCLUSION

11

that most problems on the statistics of signals coming
from HS’s and SM-SERS in general can be tracked down
to the existence of a very skewed (long-tail) distribution
of enhancements. Within this framework a series of nat-
ural consequences and explanations arise, among them:
(i) the role and meaning of ﬂuctuations at ultra-low con-
centrations, (ii) a proper justiﬁcation of SM signals at
medium concentrations (which is a justiﬁcation for the
bi-analyte method for SM-SERS developed in Ref. 12 at
the same time), and (iii) the observation of probability
distribution oscillations (“Poisson”-like), which are not
by themselves a proof of SM-SERS but have their origin
in the very peculiar characteristics of long-tail distribu-
tions. We also explored very brieﬂy some of the conse-
quences that the distribution of enhancement would have
in vibrational pumping and photobleaching under SERS
conditions. This latter predictions will have to await for
experimental conﬁrmation before further development is
justiﬁed.

Overall, the approach taken here has the advantage of
its “universal” nature in view of the fact that a power
law distribution of enhancements is most likely to exist
in SM-SERS substrates with HS’s, independent of the ex-
act details of the situation. This provides, therefore, not
only a general understanding and a theoretical frame-
work (in a ﬁeld that has been plagued with diverging
interpretations), but also a powerful phenomenological
tool to describe the statistics of SM-SERS signals with a
minimum set of parameters.

APPENDIX A

We here consider the model distribution of enhance-
ment for a single HS as deﬁned by a truncated Pareto dis-
tribution with parameters k, A, and Fmax. The param-
eters obtained in the example of Sec. II will be used for
1010.
illustration: k = 0.135, A = 0.075, and Fmax = 1.9
The pdf of the SERS enhancement factors, F , is then

p(F ) = AF −(1+k)

for Fmin < F < Fmax.

We have introduced here a minimum value for F , Fmin,
which is required for p(F ) to be a valid pdf. Fmin can
be deduced from the parameters using the normalization

The main purpose of this paper was to study the dis-
tribution of enhancements for HS’s in SERS and to un-
derstand some very general properties. We have shown

Note that Fmin is only introduced for mathematical con-
sistency in the deﬁnition of p(F ), it has no physical mean-

We now focus on the properties of a q-HS deﬁned as

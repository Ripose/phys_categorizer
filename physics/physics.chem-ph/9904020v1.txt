Abstract

A Fermi resonance-algebraic model is proposed for molecular vibrations, where

a U(2) algebra is used for describing the vibrations of each bond, and Fermi reso-

nances between stretching and bending modes are taken into account. The model

for a bent molecule XY2 and a molecule XY3 is successfully applied to ﬁt the

recently observed vibrational spectrum of the water molecule and arsine (AsH3),

respectively, and results are compared with those of other models. Calculations

show that algebraic approaches can be used as an eﬀective method for describing

molecular vibrations with small standard deviations.

Algebraic methods have been applied to molecular systems for a number of years,

and a recent review [1] is available. U(4) and U(2) algebraic model have mostly been

used so far for a description of rovibrational spectra of molecules. U(4) model has two

advantages that rotations and vibrations are treated simultaneously, and that Fermi

resonances are described by the nondiagonal matrix elements of Majorana operators.

But it becomes quite complicated when the number of atoms in a molecule is larger

than 4. U(2) model is particularly well suited for dealing with the stretching vibrations

of polyatomic molecules, and currently under further development [2∼5].

Recently, an important development on these methods is to incorporate bending

vibrational modes of polyatomic molecules. Sample molecules such as acetylene [6], as

well as X3

[2] and XY4

[5,7] molecules have been studied via algebraic methods. These

approaches suﬀer from the neglect of the Fermi resonance interactions between stretch-

ing and bending modes. Due to their importance as a mechanism for intramolecular

energy transfer and for descriptions of excited stretching and bending vibrations, Fermi

resonances have been taken into account in simple Fermi resonance-local mode models

for bent triatomic [8] and pyramidal XH3

[9] systems and in boson-realization models

for bent triatomic [10] and XY4

[11] molecules. In this paper we will introduce a Fermi

resonance-algebraic model, where a U(2) algebra is used for describing the vibration

of each bond. Our method is addressed for a bent molecule XY2 and a molecule XY3,

where Fermi resonances between the stretch and the bend are considered. In a limit,

the model corresponds to the boson-realization model. Vibrational spectra of two sam-

ple molecules H2O and AsH3 are used to test our model. This method can be extended

for describing the vibrations of molecules with other symmetry. The corresponding

results will be discussed elsewhere.

1. Hamiltonian

Let n be the total degrees of freedom of vibrations and m the degrees of freedom

of stretching vibrations in a polyatomic molecule. We introduce n U(2) algebras to

describe vibrations: Ui(2) (1 ≤ i ≤ m) for stretching modes and Uµ(2) (1 + m ≤

µ ≤ n) for bending modes. Each Uα(2) (1 ≤ α ≤ n) is generated by the operators

2

{ ˆNα, ˆJ+,α ˆJ−,α, ˆJ0,α}, satisfying the following commutation relations:

[ ˆJ0,α, ˆJ±,β] = ±δαβ ˆJ±,α,
[ ˆNα, ˆJ0,β] = 0,

[ ˆJ+,α, ˆJ−,β] = 2δαβ ˆJ0,α,
[ ˆNα, ˆJ±,β] = 0.

(1.1)

where ˆNα is related with the Casimir operator of U(2):

2 ˆJ 2

0,α + ˆJ+,α ˆJ−,α + ˆJ−,α ˆJ+,α = ˆNα( ˆNα/2 + 1).

The local basis states for each bond are written as |Nα, vαi, where Nα is the eigen-
value of ˆNα and vα the number of quanta on the αth bond. The action of ˆJ±,α on the

local states is given by

ˆJ+,α |Nα, vαi = qvα(Nα − vα + 1) |Nα, vα − 1i,
ˆJ−,α |Nα, vαi = q(vα + 1)(Nα − vα) |Nα, vα + 1i.

(1.2)

Those Nα of equivalent bonds are equal to each other: Ni = Ns, and Nµ = Nb, where

footnotes s and b refer to the stretching and the bending vibrations, respectively.

Due to Fermi resonances in the considered system, we will take V = Vs + Vb /2 as

a conservative quantity, where Vs and Vb is the total number of phonons of stretching

and bending modes, respectively. Deﬁne the scale transformations for convenience:

aα ≡ ˆJ+,α /qNα,

α ≡ ˆJ−,α /qNα.

(1.3)

In the limit of Ns → ∞ and Nb → ∞, aα(a†

α) reduce to bosonic operators with usual

boson commutation relations [2].

In the following, we will present the vibrational model in terms of Eq. (1.3) for two

molecular systems with diﬀerent symmetries.

1.1 The model for vibrations of a bent molecule XY2

For a bent triatomic molecule, we have n = 3 and m = 2. The Hamiltonian, where

the interactions are taken up to the ﬁfth orders, is given as follows:

(1.4)

where ω and x are used for comparison with the constants in the Morse potential.

λi (1 ≤ i ≤ 11) are the coupling constants. The term with λ7 describes the Fermi

resonance between the stretching and the bending vibrations. The last four terms in

Eq. (1.4) are the ﬁfth order interactions caused by Fermi resonance. In the limit of Ns

→ ∞ and Nb → ∞, Eq. (1.4) corresponds to the boson-realization model [10].

1.2 The model for vibrations of a molecule XY3

For a C3v symmetric molecule, we have n = 6 and m = 3. From the standard

method of group theory, it is not diﬃcult to obtain the character table, the represen-

tation matrices of the generator, and the Clebsch-Gordan coeﬃcients of the C3v group.

From that knowledge, Hamiltonian where the interactions are taken up to the fourth

orders are expressed in terms of operators Eq. (1.3):

η1 and η2 is the harmonic constant for the stretch and the bend, respectively. These ηp

(3 ≤ p ≤ 6) are the Fermi resonance coupling constants, ηq (7 ≤ q ≤ 11) anharmonic

constants of the stretching vibrations, and ηr (12 ≤ r ≤ 15) anharmonic constants

of interactions between the stretch and the bend. In Eq. (1.5), we have omitted the

interaction terms for the bending vibrations, which are similar to the terms with ηq

(7 ≤ q ≤ 11) for the stretching modes, and also omitted the fourth-order interactions

between the stretching and the bending vibrations. In the limit of Ns → ∞ and Nb

→ ∞, equation (1.5) reduces to the extended local mode model for three equivalent

stretching bonds [12], where the bending vibrations were neglected.

2. Applications

2.1 Application to H2O

Studies of the vibrations of the water molecule already exist in the literature. Its

stretching vibrational energy levels were calculated via nonlinear quantum theory [13].

Halonen and Carrington proposed a simple vibrational curvilinear internal coordinate

hamiltonian [8] for its vibrational levels up to 18,500 cm−1. The same levels were

studied by U(4) algebraic model [1]. Its recently observed vibrational spectrum up to
22,000 cm−1 were analyzed by the potential-energy surface from ab initio calculation

[14] as well as in the boson-realization model and the corresponding q-deformed model

[10]. Owing to much research on this molecule, it provides a good testing ground for

diﬀerent models.

Now, we calculate the Hamiltonian matrix elements in the symmetrized bases, then

determine the 15 parameters in Eq. (1.4) by a least-squares optimization in ﬁtting

the experimental data Eobs in cm−1 (their normal labels (ν1ν2ν3)), taken from the

compilation of Ref.

[14]. Two boson numbers Ns and Nb are taken to be 48 and 65,

respectively. The parameters obtained are given in cm−1 as follows:

ωs = 3705.121, xs = −4.602, ωb = 1599.485, xb = 3.913,

λ1 = −51.335,

λ2 = −12.746, λ3 = −1.004, λ4 = 3.199,

λ5 = −2.853, λ6 = −21.956,

λ7 = 12.686,

λ8 = −0.422, λ9 = −5.901,

λ10 = 2.187,

λ11 = 4.220.

Table 1

The observed and calculated vibrational levels are presented in Table 1 where our

results are also compared with those calculated in the boson-realization model [10].

The ∆Ecal are the diﬀerences between the observed and the calculated values. The

standard deviation (SD) of this ﬁt is 6.724 cm−1, while that of the boson-realization

model and the corresponding q-deformed model is 8.198 cm−1 and 7.157 cm−1 [10],

respectively. The present model applied to H2O gives a slight improvement in the ﬁt

to its vibrational energy levels.

2.2 Application to AsH3

To our knowledge, vibrations of a molecule XY3 have not been studied via algebraic

methods yet. As an example, we now apply Eq. (1.5) to the vibrational spectrum

of arsine (AsH3). The calculation of energy levels will be greatly simpliﬁed if the

symmetrized bases are used. For the considered system, these bases can be obtained

by the method of Ref. [7]. This method is particularly useful when describing vibrations

of polyatomic molecules and for high overtones.

Recently observed data (Eobs) of AsH3 with their normal labels (ν1ν2νl3

3 νl4

4 ) are

taken from the compilation of Refs.

[9,15]. Since there are 18 experimental data for

this molecule it is not possible to determine all coupling constants in Eq. (1.5) by

a least-squares optimization. It is natural to choose the following parameters in Eq.

(1.5) nonvanishing: ωs, xs, ωb, xb, η1, η2, η3, η4, η5, and η6. In other words, we neglect

the terms with ηt (7 ≤ t ≤ 11). We have found out that other choice does not provide

improvement in our ﬁts. For comparison, we have made the ﬁrst ﬁt (Fit a) where the

model is in the limit of Ns → ∞ and Nb → ∞. The obtained parameters and the

calculated diﬀerences (∆Ea

cal) with the corresponding observed data (Eobs) in this ﬁt

are listed in Table 2 and 3. In another ﬁt (Fit b) we take the boson numbers Ns and

Nb to be 62 and 42, respectively. The results in Fit b are also listed in the related

Tables.

Table 2

Table 3

6

The SD in Fit a and b is 10.201 cm−1 and 5.827 cm−1, respectively. The calculated
results for this molecule in Fit b can be compared with those by Lukka et al [9]. However,

their vibrational Hamiltonian was expressed in terms of curvilinear internal coordinates,

and the Morse oscillator basis functions and the results of ab initio calculation were

used there.

3. Conclusion and discussion

We have proposed Fermi resonance-algebraic models for the vibrations of a bent

molecule XY2 and a molecule XY3 by U(2) algebras for the description of both stretch-

ing and bending modes, where Fermi resonances between the stretch and the bend are

considered. In the limit, the models reduce to the recently presented boson-realization

models. As an example, they have been applied to vibrational spectra of the water

molecule and arsine (AsH3). To some extend, they have provided improvement in the

standard deviations in the corresponding boson-realization models for the same ob-

served energy levels.

It needs more sample calculations to judge which approach is

better.

The present calculations and others [2∼7,10,11] demonstrate that an algebraic ap-

proach can be used as an eﬀective method for describing molecular vibrations with

good precision. In this approach the eigenvalues and the related wave functions are

obtained through matrix diagonalization. Hence, the required computing time is short,

and some other physical properties, such as transition intensities [5,11], are allowed to

calculate. It provides the possibility of using an algebraic model as a numerically eﬃ-
cient, phenomenological theory for studying molecular spectra, especially when no ab
initio calculation is available.

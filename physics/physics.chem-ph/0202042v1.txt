Abstract

We present results underlining the conjecture [16] that the aﬃne extensions for
non-crystallographic Coxeter groups introduced in this reference are suitable mathe-
matical objects for the description of the symmetries of Carbon onions and Carbon
nanotubes.
It is the hope that these considerations will shed new light on open
questions concerning structure, stability and formation of these fullerenes.

1 Introduction

Group theory is a powerful tool in crystallography, and helps to understand issues like
structure, formation and stability of crystallographic objects. It is the purpose of this paper
to provide evidence for the conjecture that a new symmetry structure recently introduced
in [16] appears to be a suitable object for a mathematical description of particular types
of fullerenes such as Carbon onions and Carbon nanotubes.

Carbon onions consist of nested cages of Carbon atoms [2]. From a group theoretical
point of view, the individual cages are characterized by their symmetry properties which
are given by the non-crystallographic Coxeter group H3 [3], which also describes the buck-
minster fullerene C60 [4]. A group theoretical description of the symmetry of a Carbon
onion as a whole, however, is lacking at present, but is needed in order to understand the
peculiarities of these objects. We demonstrate here that the technique of aﬃne extensions
of non-crystallographic Coxeter groups, which was developed in [16] for the description of
fragments of aperiodic point sets or quasicrystals, leads in the case of H3 to an aﬃne exten-
sion H aﬀ
3 which may describe the symmetries of Carbon onions as entities. In particular,

1

we show that the generators of H aﬀ
3 may be used to obtain three dimensional point sets
from a seed conﬁguration which are arranged concentrically around the origin and bear
the characteristic shell structure of Carbon onions. We show numerical studies based on
H aﬀ
3 generated models and compare the results with data about Carbon onions [2]. This
comparison suggests to understand the diﬀerent shells of a Carbon onion as diﬀerent H3
orbits, connected by the H aﬀ
symmetry via the action of the further group generator which
3
is introduced for the aﬃne extension.

The way this mathematical models for Carbon onions is built from the group action
of H aﬀ
allows for ﬂexibility, and we point out a further generic possibility here: If the
3
number of generators in H aﬀ
is restricted from four to three in a suitable way, one obtains
3
along similar lines as for Carbon onion models extended tubular structures. These bear the
characteristics of Carbon nanotubes, that is extended Carbon structures with a preferred
direction of growth [5, 6]. We give several arguments for how the approach based on H aﬀ
3
symmetry explains characteristic features of Carbon nanotubes which are pointed out for
example in [10] or the references therein.

It is possible that this study will shed new light on the mechanism of formation of
Carbon onions and Carbon nanotubes, and thus will complement existing theories (e.g.
[1]). Furthermore, the new symmetries may contribute to the discussion of stability issues
as discussed in the conclusion.

The paper is organized as follows:

After a short introduction of the non-crystallographic Coxeter group H3 and a short
description of the technique of aﬃne extensions, presented for the example of H3, we point
out two ways of deriving three dimensional point sets – and thus models for the location
of atoms – from the group action of the generators of the aﬃne extension H aﬀ
of H3.
3
One method is along the lines of [16] and leads to Carbon onion structures, the other
one is a modiﬁcation thereof and corresponds to Carbon nanotube structures. Numerical
computations for these models are presented and various planar subsets are depicted. The
results for a two dimensional cut along a ﬁvefold axis of one of these three dimensional
models is compared with the electron microscope simulations for fullerenes presented in
[2] to underline the good ﬁt of the models with fullerene data. In a next step, we discuss
the modiﬁcations necessary to accommodate Carbon nanotubes and discuss how speciﬁc
properties of Carbon nanotubes are reﬂected by the model.

Finally, we discuss open questions arising from this study, pointing to future research

along these lines.

2 Group Theoretical Building Blocks

2.1 The non-crystallographic Coxeter group H3

Coxeter groups are reﬂection groups, comprising also the Weyl groups, which are related
to the classical crystallographic setting, semisimple Lie algebras and Lie groups. In three
dimensions, which is the setting relevant for the study of real life objects such as fullerenes,

2

there exists only one non-crystallographic Coxeter group, H3. It will be discussed in detail
here because all further considerations are based on it.

Coxeter groups are characterized by a root system, that is a ﬁnite collection ∆ of

nonzero vectors in Euclidean space E, satisfying

1. ∆

(1) shows that a Coxeter group can be speciﬁed by indicating a root system for it. For

H3, the root system consists of 30 roots and can be modeled as [7]

Geometrically, the root polytope of H3 is formed by 12 equilateral pentagons and 20 equi-
lateral triangles. It has 30 vertices given by the elements in ∆3 and 60 edges. Alternatively,
one may view the roots of ∆3 given in (2) as icosians [8, 9], that is purely imaginary quater-
nions of special kind.

The root system of H3 can be expressed in term of a subset, called basis of simple roots.

In the orthonormal basis, it is given as

α1 = (0, 0, 1) , α2 = 1
2(

τ ′,

τ,

1) , α3 = (0, 1, 0) .

The information about the simple roots can be encoded in the Cartan matrix:

A := (aij) =

2(αi

According to (1) this encodes the generators of the group, and allows to derive an explicit
representation for them using this formula. Furthermore, the group relations can be read
oﬀ from the Cartan matrix as follows, using rk

rαk to shorten notation:

Objects with H3 symmetry have correspondingly 10-, 6- and 4-fold rotational symme-
try axes and from (6) it is clear that the generators corresponding to these symmetries
are obtained via a restriction of the group generators to a corresponding subgroup. For
instance, a 10-fold symmetry axis corresponds to the action of the subgroup H2 of H3,
given by the action of the generators r2 and r3 in (6).

2.2 H aﬀ

3 as an aﬃne extension of H3

Aﬃne extensions of non-crystallographic Coxeter groups have been introduced and dis-
cussed in [16], and we thus only brieﬂy indicate the main steps here.

In general terms, the idea is to introduce a further group generator. Due to the cor-
respondence between Cartan matrix and group generators pointed out above, this can be
done via an extension of the Cartan matrix. This process is subject to conditions imposed
on the extended Cartan matrix A = (aij), and in the non-crystallographic case these are

Z[τ ]− :=

x

with τ as in (3).

det(aij) = 0 ,

In particular, in the case of H3, this leads to the following unique (see [16]) extension

aii = 2 ,

aij = aji ,

with coordinates in the basis of fundamental weights (or ω-basis)

We remark that the action of T corresponds to a translation by the highest root vector

3 Models for Atomic Conﬁgurations based on H aﬀ
3

There are several options to construct three dimensional point sets with H aﬀ
symmetry
3
as models for atomic conﬁgurations in fullerenes. The simplest possibility is to consider
point sets which are obtained from a seed conﬁguration under an iterate application of
the group generators of H aﬀ
3 . Clearly, due to the fact that H3 is non-crystallographic, the
unrestricted action of the full group leads to a dense ﬁlling of R3, and one needs to apply
appropriate restrictions.

We are considering two types of restrictions in this letter:

1. A restriction of the number of times the generator of the central extension, T , is

allowed to act on the initial conﬁguration.

2. A restriction of the four generators of H aﬀ
3

to a subset of three generators containing

T and two further reﬂections.

Both restrict the group action of H aﬀ

3 by restricting the monomials built from the group

generators of H aﬀ
3

to an allowed subset. In particular, we have

1. monomials with a limited occurrence of the generator T . Since the actions of the
other generators are cyclic, this restriction leads to a ﬁnite set for the subset of
allowed monomials.

2. monomials with a (possibly) inﬁnite occurrence of T , but not containing one of the
other three (cyclic) group generators. If in addition the occurrence of T is restricted,
ﬁnite tubular structures are modeled, otherwise, the structures are generically inﬁ-
nite.

The ﬁrst case corresponds to Carbon onions and the second one to Carbon nanotubes,

and we discuss these cases separately below.

3.1 Carbon onions

This case is similar to the models for H aﬀ
2 -induced quasicrystals introduced and discussed
in [16]. Let sm(T, r1, r2, r3) denote the set of all sequences formed by the operators T and
r1, . . . , r3 in which T appears precisely m times, that is all monomials formed by generators
of H aﬀ
such that T appears precisely m times, and let O denote the origin of coordinates.
3
Then the point sets are given by the action of these monomials on the seed point O, that
is

Q3(n) :=

sm(T, r1, r2, r3) O

{

m

n
}

≤

|

(11)

n is called the cut-oﬀ-parameter. Note that Q3(n) is a family of 3-dimensional point sets
depending on n. These point sets are thus characterized by

Figure 1: Cut perpendicular to a 4-fold axis through the origin with cut-oﬀ n = 3.

1. a choice of an initial conﬁguration, chosen to be the origin O.

2. a cut-oﬀ parameter n, which restricts the frequency of the action of T , and thus the

monomials formed by the generators of H aﬀ
3 .

Note that there is some freedom in the choice of the seed conﬁguration. However, O is
a canonical choice since after one iteration step, the root system of H3 is obtained, that is
Q3(1) = ∆3, and thus H3 symmetry – which is characteristic of individual fullerene shells –
is automatically obtained. Furthermore, any choices of seed conﬁgurations coinciding with
a subset of ∆3 necessarily lead to the same result, because due to the action of H3 the full
root system ∆3 is reproduced in the ﬁrst iteration step.

Analogously to Proposition 6.1 in [16] it follows that from a geometric point of view,
the point set obtained under the action of the allowed monomials subject to a cut-oﬀ
parameter n on the seed conﬁguration in (11) corresponds to the point set obtained via
arbitrary linear combinations of up to n vectors from ∆3, that is linear combinations of up
to n (not necessarily diﬀerent) icosians:

Using this expression, the three dimensional point sets Q3(n) can be computed explicitly
for a given cut-oﬀ parameter n. In ﬁgures 1 and 2, we display two-dimensional cuts which
contain the origin and are perpendicular to a 6- and 4-fold rotational symmetry axis for
the cut-oﬀ parameter 3.

Furthermore, we show the eﬀect of the growth parameter on the plane corresponding

to 10-fold symmetry in the ﬁgures 4 – 6.

To compare the conﬁgurations of point sets obtained above with data about fullerenes,
we compare with the election-microscope simulation of fullerene concentric shells presented
in [2], which is given in ﬁgure 7.

We observe that this picture has a very good qualitative ﬁt with the point set in
ﬁgure 4 corresponding to the 10-fold rotational axis with cut-oﬀ parameter 3. To facilitate

This correspondence between ﬁgure 7 and ﬁgure 8 can be used to explain among others
the peculiar shape of the second inner circle in ﬁgure 7: mathematically, it stems from the
fact that the corresponding H3 orbits in the mathematical picture are shifted with respect
to each other, and the amount of the shift is dictated by the underlying H aﬀ
symmetry,
3
thus not visible in considerations based merely on H3.

3.2 Carbon nanotubes

Carbon nanotubes are tubular graphitic structures, which may be nested or appear as a
single tube. Experimental data show that they occur with a wide distribution of lengths

and diameters. Observations show furthermore [10] that even if deformed under external
forces, nanotubes regain their initial form without any apparent damage, which points to
the fact that there must be a strong organizing principle underlying their structure, and
we suggest here the group structure of H aﬀ

3 as a possible explanation.

×

to a 3

From the point of view taken in this paper, nanotube structures arise naturally via a
restriction of the generators of H aﬀ
3 : if instead of the full H aﬀ
symmetry only group elements
3
obtained from two of the three generators rk, k = 1, 2, 3, together with T , are admitted,
then we obtain tubular structures, where the preferred direction of growth coincides with
the translation direction of T . It is important to note that we do not mean here a restriction
3 sub-matrix ˜A obtained via deleting a row and
of the Cartan matrix (8) of H aﬀ
3
a corresponding column, which would necessarily lead to a ﬁnite dimensional group since
then det ˜A
= 0; we rather mean a restriction of the monomials formed by generators from
H aﬀ
to a subset which is such that it does not contain one of the cyclic generators rk,
3
k = 1, 2, 3, but contains all possible monomials formed by all other generators, that is two
cyclic generators rk and the generator of the aﬃne extension, T . Note also that such a
restricted H aﬀ
symmetry is still represented as a three-dimensional object, and thus does
3
not coincide with an H aﬀ
symmetry (for an extensive discussion of this symmetry, see [16]),
2
which is conﬁned to a 2 dimensional setting. In particular, this means that the translation
direction of the generators, which are introduced via the aﬃne extension in both cases,
diﬀer, and while the translation direction in the H aﬀ
setting is given by the highest root
2
of H2 and thus is collinear with the plane orthogonal to the rotation axis, the direction of
translation of the corresponding generator in H aﬀ
3 does not lie in the plane corresponding
to the H2 (sub-)symmetry of H3. Thus, a restriction of H3 to its subgroup H2 and a
consequent aﬃne extension of the latter to H aﬀ
leads to a diﬀerent result than selecting in
2
the aﬃne extension of H aﬀ
3 particular monomials by restricting the number of generators
to a subset. This is depicted in the following diagramme:

This shows that in the context of tubal three dimensional structures such as Carbon
nanotubes, only aﬃne extensions of three dimensional group structures such as H3 can
be useful. Since H3 is the only non-crystallographic Coxeter group in three dimensions –
as opposed to the existence of inﬁnitely many non-crystallographic Coxeter groups in two
dimensions – the method for deriving three dimensional structures from a group theoretical

10

6
approach based on aﬃne extensions of non-crystallographic Coxeter groups presented here
is exhaustive and H aﬀ
symmetry plays a distinct role. Variations can only come from
3
modiﬁcations of the seed conﬁguration, cut-oﬀ parameter, or selection rules deﬁning the
admissible subsets of monomials.

In order to obtain multishell structures of nanotube type, one has to use planar initial
conﬁgurations composed of several connected, nested sets, for example circles of diﬀerent
radii, which are located in the plane through the origin and orthogonal to the rotation axis
deﬁning the restriction of H aﬀ
corresponding to the two generators ri, rj, i, j
3 .
Then, the whole setting is propagated by the generator of the aﬃne extension T .

In this picture, it is possible to explain certain phenomena which have been observed

experimentally in Carbon nanotubes:

1. In most cases, the layers of Carbon nanotubes have helicities, that is the carbon
bonds form a spiral around the cylinder [5]. This spiralling eﬀect may be explained
in the above models by the action of the generators corresponding to the restriction
of H aﬀ
3 . For instance, this may be the generators r2 and r3 in (10), which models
rotation about a 10-fold axis according to (8) applied to (6). The combined action of
the translation along a preferred axis, given by T , and a rotation about a 10-fold axis
(not given by the direction of T ) necessarily leads to the spiralling eﬀect observed in
Carbon nanotubes.

2. Another observation is that in multishell nanotubes the diﬀerent shells assist each
other during the growth [14, 15]. This may be explained in the framework of models
based on H aﬀ
3 by the fact that starting with any planar initial conﬁguration composed
of disjoint objects, nested set of circles say, these conﬁgurations are all acted upon
by the same group operations and hence their evolution in three-dimensional space
under the action of the group generators is necessarily correlated.

4 Conclusions

The models presented here are the most simple conceivable models based on an H aﬀ
sym-
3
metry: In the ﬁrst case, all group generators of H aﬀ
3 act on the initial conﬁguration, which
leads to arrangements of concentric shells typical for Carbon onions. In the second case,
the number of H aﬀ
3 generators is restricted such that only three of the four generators are
acting, which leads to the typical tube structure of Carbon nanotubes.
Though these are canonical choices to model structures with an H aﬀ
3

symmetry, there is
ﬂexibility in these models by changing the growth parameter or by starting from diﬀerent
seed conﬁgurations. The choice adapted here is a natural one from the mathematical point
of view: we choose the seed point O which leads to the root system of H3 in the ﬁrst
iteration step for the case of an action of the full set of generators as explained above,
and the root system (and rescalings thereof in the multilayer case) of the subgroup of H3
corresponding to the restriction of H aﬀ
in the restricted case. An analysis of concrete
3
experimental data may give evidence for how this freedom may be chosen to meet the

11

individual settings. For instance, the growth parameter governs the number of points in
the model, that is the number of atoms in the sample, and indications for a suitable choice
of this parameter may come from a comparison with the cage structures of the shells and
their number of atoms in concrete samples. These ﬂexibilities should be exhausted in dialog
with chemist experts in the ﬁeld.

Another possibility to generalize these models is to introduce statistical weights on the
frequency of the action of the group generators of H aﬀ
3 on the initial conﬁguration, such that
the relative frequency of appearance of the generators in the monomials is distinct, thus
leading to a diﬀerent selection rule for admissible subsets of monomials. Geometrically,
this will result in a breaking of the pure shell structures for Carbon onions, or a breaking of
the concentric cylinders in the Carbon nanotube case. Experimental evidence points to the
fact that nested structures are preferred conﬁgurations, with the scroll structure appearing
only if defects are present in a tube [11, 12, 13]. Thus, defect structures may be explained
by a deviation from the ideal mathematical situation of equal frequency of occurrence. It
is quite possible that such considerations are related to questions of stability and energy
balance in the sense that certain statistical weights are preferred from this point of view.
In any case, the fact that the electronic properties of Carbon nanotubes depend strongly
on their geometry [10] points to the fact that the identiﬁcation of an organizational principle
or symmetry, respectively group structure, underlying the geometry, will be an essential
tool to tackle the numerous open questions in the ﬁeld of Carbon onions and Carbon
nanotubes.

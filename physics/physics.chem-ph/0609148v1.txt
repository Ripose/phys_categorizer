Density functional theory is extensively employed for the calculation of atomic and molecular
properties. Achieving greater chemical accuracy or computational eﬃciency is desirable and this
has motivated attempts to construct improved kinetic-energy functionals (KEFS) but that is not
our aim in this paper. Rather, we aim to obtain expressions for the exact kinetic energy and exact
noninteracting kinetic energy that provide a general framework for the development of KEFS. We
employ a recently formulated dequantization procedure to obtain the kinetic energy of an N -electron
system as the sum of an N -electron classical kinetic energy and an N -electron purely quantum kinetic
energy arising from the quantum ﬂuctuations that turn the classical momentum into the quantum
one. We show that the N -electron purely quantum kinetic energy can be written as the sum of the
(one-electron) Weizs¨acker term (TW ) and an (N -1)-electron kinetic correlation term. We further
show that TW results from local ﬂuctuations while the kinetic correlation term results from nonlocal
ones. We then write the N -electron classical kinetic energy as the sum of the (one-electron) classical
kinetic energy (TCl) and another (N -1)-electron kinetic correlation term. For one-electron orbitals
we then obtain an expression for the noninteracting kinetic energy as the sum of TCl and TW . The
TCl term is seen to be explicitly dependent on the phase of the one-electron orbital and this has
implications for the development of accurate orbital-free KEFS. Also, there is a direct connection
between TCl and angular momentum and, across a row of the periodic table, the TCl component of
the noninteracting kinetic energy will generally increase as Z increases.

INTRODUCTION

A. Density Functional Theory

Density functional theory has developed into an extremely successful approach for the calculation of atomic and
molecular properties. [1, 2, 3] In this approach, the electron density, ρ(r), is the fundamental variable and properties
such as the energy are obtained from ρ rather than from the N -electron wavefunction, ψ(r1, . . . , rN ), as in conventional
quantum mechanical approaches based on the Schr¨odinger equation. The motivation for density functional theory is
clear — if properties such as the energy can be obtained from ρ then calculations on systems with a large number of
electrons are, in principle, no more diﬃcult than those on systems with a small number. However, this depends on
having accurate energy functionals which, in practice, is a serious problem. The energy can be partitioned into kinetic
and potential terms and a clear zeroth-order choice of functional for the potential energy is the classical expression
d3r1d3r2. However, for atomic and molecular systems, there is no correspondingly

B. Quantum ﬂuctuations

One of the key aspects of quantum mechanics is that one cannot simultaneously ascribe well-deﬁned (sharp) values
for the position and momentum of a physical system. Motivated by this, quantization procedures have been proposed

†Electronic address: mosna@ime.unicamp.br
‡Electronic address: dellsite@mpip-mainz.mpg.de

in which the quantum regime is obtained from the classical regime by adding stochastic terms to the classical equations
of motion. In particular, Nelson [5] and earlier work of F´enyes [6] and Weizel [7] has shown that the Schr¨odinger
equation can be derived from Newtonian mechanics via the assumption that particles are subjected to Brownian
motion with a real diﬀusion coeﬃcient.

We recently proposed [8] a dequantization procedure whereby the classical regime is obtained from the quantum
regime by stripping these “quantum ﬂuctuations” from the quantum momentum resulting in the classical momentum.
In particular, we introduced deformations of the momentum operator, which correspond to generic ﬂuctuations of the
particle’s momentum. These lead to a deformed kinetic energy, which roughly quantiﬁes the amount of “fuzziness”
caused by these ﬂuctuations. We showed that the deformed kinetic energy possesses a unique minimum, which is seen
to be the classical kinetic energy. In this way, a variational procedure determines the particular deformation that has
the eﬀect of suppressing the quantum ﬂuctuations, resulting in dequantization of the system.

In this paper we obtain an expression of the quantum-classical correspondence for the kinetic energy when ρ is the

fundamental variable for the quantum terms.

II. KINETIC-ENERGY FUNCTIONALS

We begin by considering some previously proposed kinetic-energy functionals whereby the kinetic energy is obtained

from the electron density, ρ. Here the electron density is given in terms of the (normalized) wavefunction by

A well-known functional for the kinetic energy, formulated by Thomas and Fermi [9, 10], is

This expression is exact for the ground state of the hydrogen atom (and N = 1 ions).

For atomic systems it might be hoped that an accurate kinetic energy functional could be obtained via some
combination of TT F and TW and, in fact, Weizs¨acker had proposed TT F + TW . Other researchers subsequently
proposed either a smaller coeﬃcient for TT F [11, 12, 13, 14, 15] or, more commonly, TW . A second-order gradient
expansion of the density for a nonuniform electron gas (valid for small reduced gradient) leads to the coeﬃcient 1
9 .
[16, 17, 18] Other expressions for the kinetic energy have been developed and, of particular relevance to our paper,
Herring [19] proposes Tθ + TW where Tθ is termed the relative-phase energy.

For large Z atoms, with inclusion of the Scott correction, [20] Dirac exchange functional, [21] and Weizs¨acker term,
the Thomas-Fermi electron density is accurate for the bulk of the electrons in the small and intermediate r region but
it is not accurate for large r. [22] Unfortunately, the large r region is (by virtue of the valence electrons) responsible
for chemical bonding and Thomas-Fermi theory cannot describe molecular systems.

B. Hohenberg-Kohn theorems and Kohn-Sham approach

Density functional theory was placed on a solid foundation by the work of Hohenberg and Kohn [25] who proved that
the total energy can indeed be obtained as a functional of ρ. Their proof also applies to the kinetic energy but they
could provide no prescription for constructing the exact kinetic-energy functional. Kohn and Sham [26] subsequently
provided a prescription for calculating the noninteracting kinetic energy by adapting aspects of Hartree-Fock theory.
In Hartree-Fock theory the wavefunction is approximated as the product of N one-electron orbitals (antisymmetrized
to ensure that electron exchange is incorporated exactly for the approximate wavefunction). In constructing these
orbitals the eﬀect of the other electrons is included only in an average way (through the use of an eﬀective potential)
and electron correlation is neglected. Calculations scale as N 3 and post Hartree-Fock approaches incorporating
electron correlation (required for chemical accuracy) typically scale as N 5 or N 7. Kohn and Sham employed the
orbital approximation but chose the eﬀective potential such that for the one-electron orbitals, φi, the resulting density
is equal to ρ. From these orbitals they obtained the noninteracting kinetic energy as Ts = ~2
2d3r rather
than as a direct functional of ρ. As in Hartree-Fock theory, electron exchange is incorporated exactly and electron
correlation is neglected. Complete calculations employ an exchange-correlation functional for the diﬀerence between
Ts and the exact kinetic energy (and also the diﬀerence between the classical electrostatic energy and the exact
potential energy). As in Hartree-Fock theory, calculations are order N 3 but, as high-quality exchange-correlation
functionals have been developed, chemical accuracy can be realized and it is in this form that density functional
theory has been most successful for the calculation of atomic and molecular properties.

C. Orbital-free kinetic-energy functionals

Despite the success of the Kohn-Sham approach, there has been continued interest in developing expressions (termed
orbital-free kinetic-energy functionals) which obtain the noninteracting kinetic energy, Ts, as a direct functional of ρ.
The very practical motivation is that these calculations could be order N and much larger systems would therefore
be tractable but chemical accuracy has not yet been realized. A recent study [27] carefully analyzed kinetic-energy
functionals of the TT F + λTW form while other recent studies [28, 29] considered the accuracy of various kinetic-
energy functionals which combine TT F , TW and higher-order gradient expansion terms in more complicated ways. The
development of orbital-free kinetic-energy functionals continues to be an active area of research. [30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35]
For one-electron orbitals we obtain an expression for the noninteracting kinetic energy as the sum of the classical
kinetic energy and the Weizs¨acker term. It will be seen that the classical kinetic energy is explicitly dependent on
the phase of the one-electron orbital and our expression is therefore not orbital-free. However, we will show that our
expression is exact and this has implications for the development of accurate orbital-free kinetic-energy functionals.
For the ground state of a given multi-electron atom we have no algorithm for optimizing the classical kinetic energy
component and we therefore have no prescription for constructing the exact kinetic-energy functional. However, in
section IV C we will present numerical results which demonstrate that our expression is exact for basis functions that
are the product of radial functions and spherical harmonics. For these basis functions, which are typically used to
represent one-electron orbitals for the ground states of multi-electron atoms, we establish a direct connection between
the classical kinetic energy and the angular momentum. It is clear that the basis functions with nonzero angular
momentum contribute more to, for example, the one-electron orbital for the ground state of the C atom than to that
for the ground state of the Be atom. It is therefore clear that the noninteracting kinetic energy for the C atom will
have a larger classical kinetic energy component than will that for the Be atom.

so that, from Eq. (7),

This quantity is the mean kinetic energy of a classical ensemble, described by the density pN and momentum ∇SN
[37, 38] and we therefore refer to Tuc as the N -electron classical kinetic energy TCl,N .

The N -electron kinetic energy can be expressed, from Eq. (10), as

This is the sum of the N -electron classical kinetic energy and a purely quantum term which is essentially given by
the N -electron Fisher information although, as our approach is restricted to scalar particles, eﬀects due to electron
spin are not explicitly included and our expressions are valid only for a single-spin wavefunction.

We ﬁrst consider the N -electron classical kinetic energy of Eq. (14). It immediately follows from Eq. (13) that
TCl,N =0 if and only if the N -electron phase is constant. Since a constant N -electron phase can always be redeﬁned
to be zero, this is the case if and only if the wavefunction is real.

We now consider the purely quantum term of Eq. (14). As in Ref. [39] we decompose the N -electron density as
pN (r1, . . . , rN ) = p(r1)f (r2, . . . , rN |

Eq. (20) decomposes the N -electron kinetic energy as the sum of a classical term and two purely quantum terms and
constitutes an expression of the quantum-classical correspondence for the N -electron kinetic energy when ρ is the
fundamental variable for the quantum terms.

Each term of Eq. (20) adds an independent nonnegative contribution to the kinetic energy and this equation agrees
with the decomposition of Sears et al. [39] when the N -electron phase is constant (since TCl,N is zero in this case, as
discussed above). Thus we see that the classical term in Eq. (20) improves the lower bound for the general case in
which the N -electron phase is not constant.

In Eq. (20) the ﬁrst quantum term contributes to the noninteracting kinetic energy and the second contributes to
the kinetic correlation. We now assume that the N -electron classical kinetic energy, TCl,N , can be decomposed as
the sum of a term, TCl, which contributes to the noninteracting classical kinetic energy, and a term, T corr
, which
contributes to the classical kinetic correlation. Terms that contribute to the noninteracting kinetic energy can be
estimated by employing the orbital approximation. If the one-electron orbital is written as φi = √p eiSi/~ where Si(r)

In Eq. (21) the purely quantum terms, TW and ~2

one(r)d3r, comprise the N -electron Weizs¨acker term and,
as discussed above, arise in our approach from the ﬂuctuations that turn the classical momentum into the quantum
momentum, as in Nelson’s formulation of quantum mechanics. [5] Many decompositions of the N -electron Weizs¨acker
term are possible [49, 50] and, as noted above, a decomposition similar to ours has previously been proposed [39].
The novelty of our decomposition is that, from the calculation leading to Eq. (18), we can unequivocally identify TW
as resulting from the local part of the quantum ﬂuctuations, and ~2
one(r)d3r as resulting from the nonlocal
part (cf Eq. (17) and the discussion following it). The latter term contributes to the kinetic correlation and we note
that an analytic expression for the electron correlation which incorporates both kinetic and Coulombic terms has been

to construct kinetic-energy functionals and has also been employed to characterize electronic properties [52, 53]. By
also employing the Shannon entropy power [54], which is a measure of spatial delocalization, it has been possible to
partially characterize many-electron eﬀects [55, 56]. However, the connection between the kinetic correlation term and
nonlocal quantum ﬂuctuations provides a new rationale for the need to incorporate this term in exchange-correlation
functionals in order to capture the complete range of many-electron eﬀects.

C. Noninteracting kinetic energy

In the orbital approximation kinetic correlation is neglected and omitting these terms in Eq. (21), we obtain the

noninteracting kinetic energy as

We now consider Eq. (22) for two limiting cases. For the uniform electron gas (an N =

system), TW is zero.
As in the Thomas-Fermi approach, we can construct TCl by adding up the kinetic energies of one-electron orbitals
approximated as local plane waves. As the eﬀect of Pc is identical to that of P in the limiting case of constant electron
density we therefore have Ts = TT F which is the correct result for this case. For the ground state of the hydrogen
atom (and of N = 1 ions), TCl is zero and we therefore have Ts = TW which is the correct result for this case.
The standard expression for the noninteracting kinetic energy (see section II B and Eq. (26) of Ref.

[19]) is
Ts = ~2
[19], Herring then deﬁnes angular variables representing points on
the surface of an N -dimensional unit sphere as ui(r) = φi/ρ1/2.
[19], he then expresses the
noninteracting kinetic energy as Ts = Tθ + TW where Tθ, which is dependent on the ui, is termed the relative-phase
energy. Comparison of Eq. (22) in this paper and Eq. (28) of Ref.
[19] shows that (in the orbital approximation)
TCl and Tθ are equivalent. Herring interprets the relative-phase energy as the additional kinetic energy resulting
from the exclusion principle which requires the N -electron phase to vary with position (when there is more than
one electron with the same spin). His results for a variety of one-dimensional potentials show that Tθ is usually a
signiﬁcant fraction of the kinetic energy and that Tθ generally becomes larger relative to TW as Z increases. [19] The

contribution of the electron phase to the kinetic energy, which is implicit in hydrodynamic formulations of quantum
mechanics, [40] has been noted in other contexts. [19, 41, 42] For hydrogenic orbitals there is an explicit relationship
between the electron phase and the angular momentum and for hydrogenic orbitals with nonzero angular momentum,
TCl is a signiﬁcant fraction of the kinetic energy (as shown below). If hydrogenic orbitals are used as basis functions
for the ground states of multi-electron atoms then, as Z increases, the exclusion principle will force electrons into
orbitals with higher angular momentum and the number of electrons with a given angular momentum will increase in
a stepwise fashion. We note that this behavior has been demonstrated for the Thomas-Fermi electron density [43, 44]
and there have been several approaches which include angular momentum eﬀects in Thomas-Fermi theory.
[45, 46]
In the work of Englert and Schwinger [47, 48], angular momentum eﬀects are included for the express purpose of
correcting the Thomas-Fermi electron density for large r.

For the ground states of multi-electron atoms, one-electron orbitals obtained via the Kohn-Sham approach or
an orbital-free method are typically represented using basis functions that are the product of radial functions and
spherical harmonics (here the noninteracting kinetic energy is simply the kinetic energy and Eq. (22) becomes T =
TCl + TW ). For practical reasons these basis functions are usually Slater orbitals but, for simplicity, we present results
for hydrogenic orbitals. We now explicitly show that, for these basis functions, our expression for the kinetic energy
is correct and furthermore, that it is correct for the radial distributions of the integrands of T , TCl and TW . The
hydrogenic orbitals, ψ(n, l, m), are dependent on the principal quantum number n, the angular momentum quantum
number l and the magnetic quantum number m but the total energy is dependent only on n and is (in atomic units)
E = -1/2n2. Then, from the virial expression for Coulombic systems, the kinetic energy is T = -E = 1/2n2. The
classical kinetic energy is zero for ψ(2, 0, 0) and ψ(2, 1, 0) and, from direct calculation, TW is 1/8 which is equal to
T . However, the classical kinetic energy is nonzero for ψ(2, 1, 1) and ψ(2, 1,
1) and, from direct calculation, both
TCl and TW are 1/16 and TCl + TW is equal to T . Radial distributions (integrated over the angular variables) of the
integrands for TCl, TW and T are shown in Fig. 1(a). The radial distribution for TCl is dependent on n, l and

For the ground states of multi-electron atoms we expect that TCl will be greater than zero but smaller than TT F
(when the reduced gradient is small TT F has been shown [19, 42] to be an upper bound to TCl) and, across a row of the
periodic table, TCl will generally increase as Z increases. For example, the one-electron orbital for the ground state of
the C atom will have a larger l = 1 contribution than will that for the ground state of the Be atom. Correspondingly,
Ts for the C atom will have a larger TCl component than will that for the Be atom.

It is important to note that, in our approach, the classical kinetic energy is zero if the orbital is real. Thus, whereas
TCl is nonzero for ψ(2, 1, 1) and ψ(2, 1,

W are completely equivalent and are equally useful
as decompositions of Ts but their interpretation is diﬀerent.

W results from local ﬂuctuations in r and θ (as does TW for

= 1) and T r,θ

V. CONCLUSIONS

The basic problem with the expression Ts = TT F + λTW (or λTT F + TW ) is that TW incorporates exactly a part
of the noninteracting kinetic energy that is also incorporated approximately in TT F .
[12] Especially for small and
intermediate Z atoms, this component of TT F should be removed and that is why simply optimizing λ in this expression
oﬀers only limited improvement. [27] In this respect, the expression Ts = TCl + TW is a signiﬁcant improvement as TCl
and TW are orthogonal. However, we have shown above that the classical kinetic energy is explicitly dependent on the
electron phase and our expression is therefore not orbital-free. As all explicit information regarding the electron phase
is lost in constructing the electron density it is clear that any direct functional of ρ which embodies this information
must be highly nonlocal. [19, 57, 58, 59, 60] Reconstructing this information from the electron density represents a
signiﬁcant challenge for the development of accurate orbital-free kinetic-energy functionals.

For large Z atoms the electron density is fairly constant for the bulk of the electrons in the small and intermediate

r region. Consequently, in this region TW is close to zero and TCl is close to TT F which is much easier to evaluate.
For these atoms (where the N 3 scaling is of greatest concern) it might be practical to develop a hybrid approach in
which the Thomas-Fermi electron density is used but corrected for large r by evaluating TCl + TW for the valence
electrons only.

In summary, we have provided a general framework for the development of kinetic-energy functionals by utilizing
In particular,
a novel connection between density functional theory and both classical and stochastic mechanics.
we have employed a recently formulated dequantization procedure to express the N -electron kinetic energy as the
sum of the N -electron classical kinetic energy and the N -electron purely quantum kinetic energy arising from the
quantum ﬂuctuations that turn the classical momentum into the quantum momentum. We wrote the N -electron
purely quantum kinetic energy as the sum of the (one-electron) Weizs¨acker term which results from the local quantum
ﬂuctuations and a kinetic correlation term which results from the nonlocal quantum correlations. We also wrote
the N -electron classical kinetic energy as the sum of the (one-electron) classical kinetic energy and another kinetic
correlation term. Then, for one-electron orbitals (where kinetic correlation is neglected), we obtained an expression
for the noninteracting kinetic energy as the sum of the classical kinetic energy and the Weizs¨acker term. We have
shown that these expressions give insight into previously proposed kinetic-energy functionals and we hope that they
will prove useful for the construction of more accurate or eﬃcient kinetic-energy functionals.

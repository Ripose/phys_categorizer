Abstract

This paper presents an analysis of the motion of an neutral impurity species
in a nanometer scale 4He cluster, extending a previous study of the dynamics
of an ionic impurity. It is shown that for realistic neutral impurity–He po-
tentials, such as those of SF6 and OCS, the impurity is kept well away of the
the surface of the cluster by long range induction and dispersion interactions
with He, but that a large number of ‘particle in a box’ center of mass states
are thermally populated. It is explicitly demonstrated how to calculate the
spectrum that arises from the coupling of the impurity rotation and the center
of mass motion, and it is found that this is a potentially signiﬁcant source
of inhomogeneous broadening in vibration–rotation spectra of anisotropic im-
purities. Another source of inhomogeneous broadening is the hydrodynamic
coupling of the rotation of the impurity with the center of mass velocity. A
quantum hamiltonian to describe this eﬀect is derived from the classical hy-
drodynamic kinetic energy of an ellipsoid. Simple analytic expressions are
derived for the resulting spectral line shape for an impurity in bulk He, and
the relevant matrix elements derived to allow fully quantum calculations of
the coupling of the center of mass motion and rotation for an impurity con-
ﬁned in a spherical He cluster. Lastly, the hydrodynamic contribution to the
impurity eﬀective moment of inertia is evaluated and found to produce only
a minor fractional increase.

I. INTRODUCTION

The last few years have seen dramatic advances in the spectroscopy of atoms and
molecules attached to large He clusters [1]. These clusters provide a unique environment
for a spectroscopy which combines many of the attractive features of both high resolution
gas phase spectroscopy and traditional matrix spectroscopy [2]. These include the abil-
ity to obtain rotationally resolved spectra of even very large molecules such as SF6 [3] and

(CH3)3SiCCH [4] (though with eﬀective rotational constants only 1/3 – 1/5 as large as those
of the gas phase molecule), and the ability to form and stabilize extremely fragile species [5],
including high spin states of molecules. Particularly interesting is the recent demonstration
by Grebenev, Toennies, and Vilesov [6] that the free rotation is a direct consequence of
the Boson character of 4He, and can be viewed as a microscopic version of the famous An-
dronikashvili experiment [7] that was used to measure the superﬂuid fraction in bulk liquid
He.

Despite rapid progress, many fundamental questions remain about spectroscopy in this
environment. One such important question is the origin of the linewidth observed in ro–
vibrational spectra. These linewidths vary with species, from 150 MHz reported for the R(0)
line of the OCS ν3 fundamental band [8], to 1.5 cm−1 reported for H2O [9]. Very recently,
pure microwave spectra have been observed for impurity molecules (CH3CN and HCCCN)
which have linewidths on the order of 1 GHz [10]. Since this is comparable to linewidths
observed in ro–vibrational transitions, it is unlikely that vibrational dephasing, which is the
dominant line broadening mechanism in the spectra of impurities in classical liquids, also
plays a dominant role in He cluster spectroscopy. Likewise, vibrational population relax-
ation, which has been invoked as the source of line broadening, obviously cannot contribute
to the broadening in the case of microwave excitation.

Given the fact that the He clusters are uniquely ﬂuid, even down to zero temperature, it
is natural to suppose that the impurity spectra will not display inhomogeneous eﬀects. Vari-
ations in local binding sites tend to dominate the linewidth of spectra in low temperature
crystal or glass hosts. In a liquid environment, local changes in solvation lead to dynamic
ﬂuctuations in the spectral intervals, and thus can lead to dephasing but not static inhomo-
geneous eﬀects. Since the time scale for solvation ﬂuctuations, due to the large zero point
kinetic energy of He atoms in the bulk, is expected to be much faster than the dephasing
times observed in most ro–vibrational spectra, one can expect the eﬀects of the ﬂuctuating
solvation to be strongly motionally averaged. More fundamentally, it is far from clear that
we expect pure vibrational dephasing at all given the low temperature of He clusters. Tak-
ing the model of a crystalline solid, one expects dephasing to arise from interactions with
thermal excitations. Since, as will be discussed below, the only excitations thermally excited
are surface waves, and these are expected to interact extremely weakly with impurities, it
is diﬃcult to see how dephasing can be important.

The fact that the existing experiments produce a broad distribution of cluster sizes
suggests an inhomogeneous contribution to the line broadening from a size dependent shift
in the absorption. However, it is likely that this eﬀect is also not dominant in most spectra.
First, the over all shift of ro–vibrational line from the gas phase to He clusters is fairly small,
typically at most a few cm−1 [1], so the spread in shifts as one approaches the bulk limit
is expected to be small. Below, an estimate of the expected shift of the SF6 ν3 vibrational
transition due to the ﬁnite size of the He cluster will be given. Further, the experimentalist
has some control over the mean of the cluster size distribution. In previous work on SF6, it
was found that the spectral shift and temperature was essentially constant for He clusters
of > 103 He atoms [8].

An additional source of inhomogeneous environment needs to be considered, the distri-
bution of the position and orientation of the impurity relative to the surface of the cluster.
That this could be relevant is suggested by the following simple calculation. Consider an

2

impurity with an eﬀective mass (including hydrodynamic contributions) of 50 atomic mass
units (u) in equilibrium with a He cluster, which is known to be at 0.38 K [3]. This molecule
will have an root mean squared (RMS) velocity of 14 m s−1. In a cluster of diameter 10 nm,
0.7 ns for the impurity to cross
which corresponds to
the cluster. If the scattering of the impurity from the surface of the cluster leads to re–
orientational dephasing, the resulting line broadening will be
500 MHz, comparable to
what has been observed in ro–vibrational transitions [1]. An additional source of dephasing
is the hydrodynamic coupling of the molecular orientation to the molecular velocity, which
will be described in more detail below.

The simplest treatment for the motion of the impurity molecule is as a ‘particle in a box’.
This was considered in an earlier paper by Toennies and Vilesov [11]. That treatment was
unsatisfactory on several grounds however. First, as we will demonstrate below, the true
potential is not really ‘ﬂat’ inside the box relative to the low value of the thermal energy.
Second, and perhaps more importantly, they did not attempt to calculate the intensity of
transitions in this model. Since the eﬀective potential is almost the same in the upper and
lower vibrational states, there are small Frank–Condon factors for transitions that change
the center of mass quantum numbers of the impurity, and as such, changes in energy of the
particle in a box levels are not directly observable in the spectrum of a neutral impurity.

This paper will present a model that allows calculation of the eﬀective potential for the
motion of an impurity that is free to move about in a spherical liquid He droplet of radius
R. A thorough analysis of the liquid drop model for pure He clusters was provided by Brink
and Stringari [12]. The present calculation will be based upon long range interactions and
treat the He as a continuum incompressible liquid of constant number density, ρ, which we
will take as the known value of bulk liquid He. While such a model cannot be expected
to correctly describe the interaction of the impurity with the ﬁrst few solvation shells, this
solvation structure is expected to be eﬀectively constant as long as the impurity does not
too closely approach the surface of the cluster. For realistic values of the impurity–He long
range interaction, the energetics are eﬀective at keeping the impurity from this diﬃcult
region. Further, since the impurity is kept away from the edge of the cluster, the fact that
7 ˚A) interface with vacuum [13] will not be expected to
the He cluster has a diﬀuse (
signiﬁcantly eﬀect the impurity potential. Further, we can, with good approximation, keep
only the lowest order terms in the expansion of the long range He–impurity interaction in
inverse powers of distance.

The paper is organized as follows. Section II will consider a neutral, isotropic impurity,
with SF6 used as an example. Sections III and IV will consider the case of a symmetric
top or linear molecule impurity, with HCN used as an example. Section III will derive
the eﬀective potential and apply a classical model for calculation of the resulting spectra.
Section IV will derive the matrix elements needed for a fully quantum treatment of the
interaction of the center of mass motion and the rotations of the impurity for a linear
molecule, leading to a calculation of the expected spectral structure for the case of the HCN
R(0) rotational line. Section V will consider the eﬀect of the interaction of an impurity with
the internal modes of the cluster, deriving the expected shifts produced by the interaction
with the ripplons, which are quantized surface capillary waves. These interactions are found
to be completely negligible contributions to the linewidth of transitions. Section VI will
consider Hydrodynamic eﬀects and derive the eﬀective hamiltonian and matrix elements for

3

the hydrodynamic coupling of the rotation and center of mass momentum of the impurity.
When this model is applied to the HCN R(0) line, poor agreement is found with experiment.
However, it will be shown in Section VII that the combination of the anisotropic potential
terms and hydrodynamic coupling leads to a prediction for the lineshape of the R(0) line in
the OCS ro–vibrational spectrum that is in excellent agreement with that observed in Helium
clusters and reported by Toennies Group [14]. Section VIII will examine the hydrodynamic
contribution to the reduction in rotational constant for an impurity, treated as an ellipsoid.
It is found that the hydrodynamic kinetic energy only makes a minor contribution to the
observed increase in moment of inertia of impurity molecules. Lastly, section IX will provide
an overview and summary of this work.

II. ISOTROPIC NEUTRAL IMPURITY, SUCH AS SF6, IN A HELIUM CLUSTER

In a previous paper [15], the potential of an ionic impurity in a helium cluster was derived
from the ion–induced dipole interaction of the impurity in Helium. The present paper will
consider the case of a neutral impurity. As will be shown, this potential is dominated by the
leading power in the long range interaction between the impurity and atomic helium. In the
present section, the case of an impurity that has an isotropic long range interaction with He
will be considered. This will be the case for impurity molecules of tetrahedral or octahedral
symmetry as well as for atomic impurities. In the next section, the case of an anisotropic
long range interaction, as expected for a linear molecule impurity, will be treated.

As in our previous paper, we will take as a reference of energy not an isolated impurity
atom or molecule, but the impurity in bulk He with constant He number density, ρ.
In
this way, the diﬀerence between an impurity inside the cluster and our reference state is the
absence in the later case of He outside the cluster. We will also implicitly assume that the
impurity is far enough away from the surface of the He cluster that we treat the interaction
of the impurity with this ‘missing’ He as pairwise additive and we can use only the long
range terms of the potential.

Let the interaction energy of the impurity with the He be a van der Waals attraction at

long range, with a long range form of :

Where C6 and C8 are the long range dispersion interaction constants and r is the distance
from the center of mass of the impurity to the He atom. For SF6, the lowest order anisotropic
term appears at the r−10 level.

Consider the impurity to be displaced from the center of a He cluster of radius R by a
distance a. The z axis is deﬁned as parallel to displacement vector of the impurity from
the center of the cluster, which provides the origin for the coordinate system. Let r(θ) be
the distance from the impurity to the droplet surface at a polar angle θ measured from the
impurity. Basic trigonometry gives:

R2 = (a + r cos(θ))2 + r2 sin(θ)2 = a2 + r2 + 2ra cos(θ)

nanometer scale He clusters. If we assume that the eﬀective mass for translational motion
of the impurity is Meﬀ = 186 u (the SF6 plus 10 He atoms to include hydrodynamic eﬀects
and some ‘sticking’ of solvated He atoms), we get a harmonic frequency for vibration of
the impurity about the center of the He cluster of 790 MHz. Figures IX and IX show the
energy levels of this potential below 1 cm−1
4 kbTc, calculated using the Numerov-Cooley
≈
method [18]. Inspection of the Energy as a function of n (radial) and L (angular momentum)
quantum numbers shows that the thermally well populated energy levels have a spectrum
much more like that of a particle in a three dimensional harmonic well than a particle in a
spherical ‘box’. Figure IX contains a plot of the probability density for ﬁnding the impurity
a distance a from the from the center of a R = 3 nm cluster, calculated both from the
set of eigenfunctions and from the classical Boltzmann distribution. We see an excellent
agreement of the two, conﬁrming the classical character of this motion even at Tc. We see
that the probability density is largely localized in the region with a less than about half
the cluster radius. The RMS value for the displacement of the impurity from the cluster
center is 0.96 nm. The highly classical nature of the thermal motion can also be seen by
comparing the thermodynamic functions calculated from the exact quantum energy levels
and for classical motion with the same potential. This comparison is shown in table 1. Also
included in this table is the mean squared orbital angular momentum (calculated in units of

5

¯h2), calculated as the thermally averaged value of L(L + 1), where L is the orbital angular
momentum quantum number of the impurity motion around the center of the cluster, which
is compared to the classical thermal mean value of < L2 >= 2MeﬀkbTc < a2 > /¯h2. The
table also contains the thermodynamic averages for a cluster of R = 5 nm as well as the
corresponding properties of the ripplons (to be discussed below). It can be seen that the
average energy and heat capacity are intermediate between those of a true particle in a box
and a particle in a Harmonic well. The partition function for translation grows faster than
the volume of the cluster, a factor of 15.3 compared to 4.6 when the radius of the cluster is
increased from 3 to 5 nm. This reﬂects the fact that in a larger cluster, the impurity gets
to thermally sample a larger fraction of the cluster volume, as demonstrated by the RMS
thermal displacement, √a2.

III. SYMMETRIC TOP OR LINEAR MOLECULE IMPURITY IN THE HELIUM
CLUSTER

We will now assume we have an impurity with an anisotropic interaction with He. If the
impurity is in the center of the cluster, it will experience an isotropic net potential, due to
the symmetry of the distribution of He atoms. However, as the impurity moves away from
the center, it will experience an anisotropic potential. This anisotropy will cause a coupling
between the center of mass motion of the impurity and its rotational motion, and can be
expected to result in orientational dephasing. It is of interest to point out that the thermal
mean value of the orbital angular momentum (L) of the impurity in the cluster
20 ¯h is
much greater than the thermally populated value of rotational angular momentum of the
impurity, (j), and as a consequence the procession of j about the total angular momentum
J would be expected to completely dephase the average dipole moment, and lead to line
broadening.

≈

The long range interaction of a neutral, symmetric top impurity with He can be written
as the sum of two parts, one due to induction and the other dispersion. The former is
dominated by the dipole induced dipole interaction for an impurity with a permanent dipole
moment. We can write the potential in the following form [19]:

V (r, φ) =

C60
r6 −

C62
r6 P2(cos(φ))

C71
r7 P1(cos(φ))

C73

−

−
where Pn are the Legendre polynomials, and φ is the angle between the vector from the
center of mass of the impurity to the He, and the symmetry axis of the impurity. The
induction contributions to these coeﬃcients can be calculated [19] from the dipole moment,
µ, and quadrupole moment, Θ, of the impurity and the polarizability, α, of He:

The dispersion contributions to the long range interactions can be written as integrals over
the imaginary frequency dependence of the polarizability of He and the polarizability and

dipole-quadrupole polarizabilities of the impurity [20]. Polarizablility is higher parallel than
perpendicular to bonds. As a result, for linear molecules and most prolate symmetric tops,
C62 > 0, which means that for such impurities, the interaction is lower in energy when the
He-impurity displacement is parallel rather than perpendicular to the impurity symmetry
axis.

To ﬁnd the eﬀective potential of the impurity in the cluster, we will once again integrate
the above eﬀective long range interaction (Eq. 9) over the He atoms ‘missing’ from the
cluster. As before, we deﬁne the z axis as along the displacement of the molecule from the
center of the cluster. We also deﬁne χ as the angle between symmetry axis of the impurity
and this z axis. In terms of these coordinates, we have the angle, φ, between this impurity
symmetry axis and the vector from the impurity to a point in space as:

cos(φ(r′)) = sin(θ) cos(ϕ) sin(χ) + cos(θ) cos(χ)

(12)

where θ and ϕ are the spherical coordinates of the point r′ deﬁned relative to the position
of the impurity. The results of the integration give the following results for the eﬀective
potential for the impurity:

If we consider the case of HCN in a He cluster of R = 3 nm, and use the parameters

given above, we get for the eﬀective potential:

+0.0619F4(y)P2(cos(χ)) + 0.0031F6(y)P3(cos(χ)) ) cm−1

(23)

We see that the two C7 terms (F5(y) and F6(y)) can be neglected in ﬁrst approximation
compared to the isotropic and leading anisotropic term (F2(y) and F4(y)) that derive from
the C6 terms. These coeﬃcients are comparable to the line widths observed in ro–vibrational
spectra of molecules inside of He clusters. The V 0
2 isotropic term will conﬁne the impurity
near the center of the cluster. As discussed above, this term determines the eﬀective potential
for the translational motion of the the impurity, while the weaker anisotropic term will couple
the translational motion to the rotation of the impurity molecule. Figure IX shows a plot
of these two terms as a function of a for the case considered here, along with a plot of the
thermal probability density distribution as calculated from the isotropic potential, V 0
2 F2(y).
It can be seen that the anisotropic term, V 0
4 F4(y), is much smaller than the isotropic term
over the full range of displacements that are thermally well populated.

Since C60 > 0, it is lower in energy for the HCN axis to be perpendicular to the displace-
ment from the center of the cluster (φ = π/2). This is easily rationalized if one considers
the case of HCN below a ﬂat He surface. When φ = π/2, the nearest ‘missing Helium’ is
perpendicular to the HCN molecular axis, and this cost less energy than when φ = 0. If the
interaction energy is much weaker than the seperation of rotational levels of the impurity,
which will be the case for HCN for all the thermally well populated conﬁgurations, to ﬁrst
order we can consider the eﬀective potential for translational motion to be the average of
the eﬀective potential over the rotational function of the impurity. For a linear molecule, the
odd Legendre terms average to zero, while the P2 term will split the mj degeneracy of each
j level, such that the center of gravity is conserved. If we consider the impurity center of
mass displacement as static, then the natural axis of quantization of the angular momentum
is parallel to this displacement, with an energy of a j, mj rotational state equal to:

∆E(a, J, M) = V 0

which implies that mj = 0 states have the highest energy and mj = j the lowest of each
manifold of ﬁxed j states.

A proper quantum mechanical treatment of the coupling of the rotation and translational
motion of an anisotropic impurity will be given in the next section. This section will close
by demonstrating a simple ‘classical’ application of the above results to estimate a line
broadening mechanism in the case of SF6. The ground state of SF6 has octahedral symmetry,
and thus has only an isotropic long range interaction, as discussed above. However, the IR
allowed vibrational excitations are to triply degenerate levels. The ν3 mode observed in
the IR spectrum of SF6 in He clusters has a particularly large vibrational transition dipole

8

1 transition. As the SF6 is displaced in the ν3
moment of µ3 = 0.388 Debye for the ν3 = 0
→
mode, it will have a dipole moment proportional to normal coordinate Q3. This dipole result
in a dipole–induced dipole interaction with the He, which modiﬁes the force constant for
this normal mode [21]. The modiﬁcation of the ν3 wavenumber (relative once again to SF6
in bulk liquid He), as a function of the position of the SF6 in the cluster and the orientation
of the triply degenerate ν3 mode are given by Equations 10 and 13, with the derivative of
the dipole with respect to the dimensionless normal coordinate (which is just √2 larger than
the fundamental transition dipole moment) replacing the permanent dipole moment. If we
treat these coordinates classically, we can calculate the spectrum of the ν3 mode of SF6 in
the cluster, relative to SF6 in bulk liquid He from the eﬀective potential. Thus, we can write
ν3(a, χ) as

ν3(a, R, χ) = ν3(

) is the frequency of ν3 in the bulk He limit and χ is the angle between the diplacement
ν3(
of the SF6 and the direction of polarization of the ν3 mode. Note that this expression would
be exact if a did not change in time, i. e. we have a static inhomogeneous distribution
of impurity positions, as in a matrix without diﬀusion. Dynamic motion of a and χ will
tend to motionally average the instantaneous frequency ν3(a(t), χ(t)) and lead to a narrower
spectrum than predicted by this approximation, which is sometimes known as the ‘statis-
tical method’ [22] and was ﬁrst introduced by Kuhn and London [23] to model pressure
broadening.

For the case of the ν3 mode of SF6 in a R = 3 nm He cluster, ν0 = 16 MHz. Since the
isotropic term, F2(y) dominates over the anisotropic term, F4(y), over the range of impurity
displacements that are thermally populated, we will keep only the isotropic term. We can
write the spectral density, S(ν) as

In their earlier paper that considered ‘particle in a box’ states of an impurity in He
clusters, Toennies and Vilesov [11] proposed that these levels could be directly observed as
satellite lines on a vibrational band of an impurity. They suggested that such particle in a
box state changing transitions could gain intensity due to diﬀerences in the eﬀective potential
in the upper and low vibrational states, but reported no estimate of the expected intensities
of such transitions. Using the SF6 example, the author has calculated Frank–Condon factors
for transitions that change the quantum numbers for the center of mass motion along with
10−4. This
a vibrational transition. The largest such Frank–Condon factor was below
is not unexpected since the excited state has an eﬀective potential that is stronger by only
0.1%. Based upon this analysis, it appears unlikely that such center of mass motion
≈
changing transitions will be directly observed unless the change in potential with vibrational
coordinate is much larger. It is worth pointing out that the spectral structure that Toennies
and Vilesov suggested may be due to such transitions was latter assigned by them to the
rotational structure of the vibrational transition inside the He cluster [3].

IV. INTERACTION OF IMPURITY TRANSLATIONAL AND ROTATIONAL
MOTIONS

Because the interaction between the impurity and the He cluster depends upon both the
position of the impurity in the cluster and the orientational angles of the impurity, there is
a coupling that can lead to relaxation of the orientational order, and thus line broadening in
the impurity spectra. The purpose of this section is to elaborate how this can be calculated.
While the physical origin of the eﬀect is quite diﬀerent, this problem has some mathematical
similarity to the coupling of rotation and translation that has been used to model the IR
spectra of light rotors in solid noble–gas matrices [24–27]

We will assume our impurity is free to move in the cluster with an eﬀective mass Meﬀ.
We will further assume it to be a linear molecule with an eﬀective rotational constant Beﬀ
in Helium. We will model the system with the hamiltonian:

H =

2 operates on the center of mass coordinates of the impurity, j is the
In this equation,
angular momentum operator for rotation of the impurity and θ12 is the angle between the
displacement of the impurity from the center of the cluster and the direction of the linear
axis of the impurity. The results are easily extended to include other Legendre terms, such
as those that arise from the r−7 terms in the long range potential of an isolated impurity
and He atom.

If we keep all but the last term in our zero order hamiltonian, then rotational and

translational motion are separable and we can write wavefunctions as:

matrix elements are comparable to the separation of the center of mass motion states, but
are much less than the seperations of the rotational energy levels of the impurity, the matrix

Recently, Nauta and Miller [30] have observed the R(0) transition in the C–H funda-
mental band of HCN. They ﬁnd that the lineshape consists of two features, with a width
and seperation in qualitative agreement with the above ‘statistical’ model, i.e., as predicted
without motional averaging. Furthermore, they have studied the spectrum as a function of
external electric ﬁeld, and have found that the two features correlate with the two high ﬁeld

V. INTERACTION OF IMPURITY WITH HE CLUSTER EXCITATIONS

Up to now, we have considered the eﬀect of the cluster potential on the rotational and
translational degrees of freedom of an impurity. We will now consider the interaction of the
impurity with the internal vibrational excitations of the He cluster. These can be separated

12

into two types. The ﬁrst are bulk excitations that consist of density ﬂuctuations or phonons.
The second are surface excitations that consist of capillary waves and are known as ripplons.
As discussed by Brink and Stringari [12], for a cluster of N atoms, the lowest phonon
excitation, the symmetric breathing mode, has a frequency of 540 N −1/3 GHz. Even for
a cluster of N = 104 He atoms, this corresponds to 25 GHz which is much larger than
kbTc/h = 8.0 GHz. Thus, only a few percent of such clusters have any quanta of excitation
in the phonon modes. This implies that such modes cannot produce a signiﬁcant level of
inhomogeneous broadening in impurity spectra. It is possible to observe excitations of the
phonon modes in an impurity absorption spectrum, but such excitations should appear as a
well separated ‘phonon side band’ which peaks several cm−1 to the blue of the ‘zero phonon
line’ which does not involve phonon excitations. Such phonon wings are commonly seen
in the electronic spectra of impurities in He [31,32], but have not yet been observed in
impurity vibration-rotation spectra. This is presumably due to a small change in eﬀective
He solvation around impurities following vibrational excitation. As a result, almost all the
transition intensity is concentrated in the zero phonon line.

In contrast, the lowest frequency surface waves have much lower wavenumbers, and exci-
tations are thermally excited even at the low temperature of He clusters. These excitations
involve no change in He density and the only restoring force is due to the increase in surface
area caused by the change in the surface shape. The theory of such surface waves is pre-
sented in the classic text on Hydrodynamics by H. Lamb [33], and discussed, in the context
of He clusters, by Brink and Stringari [12], who calculated the spectra and thermodynamic
functions of these excitations as a function of cluster size.

Due to excitation of ripplons, the surface of the He cluster develops oscillations. If we
consider a point of the surface of the cluster at polar angles θs, φs (again, relative to some
arbitrary lab ﬁxed coordinate system), we can write the displacement of the surface as:

r(θs, ϕs) = R +

S(Ls, Ms)YLs,Ms(θs, ϕs)

(41)

XLs,Ms

In the above equation, S(Ls, Ms) is the normal coordinate of the surface wave with angular
momentum quantum numbers Ls, Ms. The theory assumes that S(Ls, Ms)

assume that the surface tension of He is σ = 380 µJm−2 [12], the frequency of the Ls, Ms
surface mode is independent of Ms and is given by:

For a cluster of size N = 104, ν(Ls = 2) = 2.2 GHz. The clusters will have a maximum
(π/2)N 1/3 which is estimated by assuming that the smallest wavelength
value of (Ls)max ≈
twice the mean interparticle distance. For a cluster of R = 3 nm, this corresponds
is
to (Ls)max = 26. Table 1 presents thermal average quantities for the ripplons in clusters

≈

13

of sizes R = 3 & 5 nm, which can be compared with the thermal averages of the impurity
center of mass motion presented. Note that the average energy and entropy in the ripplons
greatly exceeds that of the impurity and forms the dominant ‘heat bath’ of the cluster.
However, the average thermal angular momentum in the impurity center of mass motion
approximately equals the total in the ripplons. We can thus anticipate that in coming to
equilibrium, the angular momentum constraints may play an important role. It is also worth
noting that for a cluster of size R = 3 nm, the total canonical internal energy at Tc is about
18.8kbTc [12]. Thus, one
equal to the energy required to evaporate a single He atom,
can anticipate that smaller clusters will be slightly warmer than larger clusters, due to their
low heat capacity. This is in contrast to the fact that we expect a slight decrease in He
binding energy for smaller clusters, and thus higher vapor pressure, which would argue that
smaller clusters should be colder. The decrease in binding energy, due to change in surface
free energy, can be estimated as 2σ/(ρR) = 1.73
nm/R, and is considerably larger
than the increase in binding energy caused by attraction to a neutral impurity, which is

We can model the interaction between an impurity and a ripplon by considering the
change in the sum of impurity – He interactions caused by the modulation in the surface of
the cluster. Let δr(θs, ϕs) be the modulation in the cluster radius in the direction (θs, ϕs)
measured from the center of the cluster. (Note: this is a change from our previous treat-
ments where we used polar angles deﬁned from the impurity). As above, let y equal to the
normalized distance of the impurity from the center of the cluster. To ﬁrst order in δr, we
can write the change in He–impurity interactions as:

where C60 and C62 are the isotropic and anisotropic contributions of the C6 coeﬃcients, Ωs
is the surface solid angle, θis is the angle between the vector from the center of the cluster
to the impurity and the vector from the center of the cluster to the surface, and θisr is the
angle between the vector from the impurity to the point on the surface in direction θs, φs
from the center of the cluster and the vector along the symmetry axis of the impurity. It
is also useful to introduce the additional quantities as follows: ris, the distance from the
impurity to the surface; θir, the angle between the vector from the center to the impurity
and the vector along the axis of the impurity; and θsr, the angle between the vector from
the center to the surface and the vector along the axis of the impurity. We can write these
angles in terms of the three sets of polar angles for the impurity center of mass (θi, ϕi), the
surface (θs, ϕs), and the rotor (θr, ϕr) as follows:

cos(θis) = cos(θi)
cos(θir) = cos(θi)

An exact treatment of this model would consider the simultaneous interaction of the
surface waves, the center of mass motion of the impurity, and the rotation of the impurity,

14

each of which has its own angular momenta that must be coupled. We will consider here
instead a model for the interaction of the ripplons and impurity rotation alone. As such,
we will treat the impurity as ﬁxed at some normalized distance, y, from the center of the
cluster in a direction we will select for the z axis. In the end, we will predict the spectrum by
averaging over the possible positions y, using a Boltzmann weighting. In this approximation
we have cos(θis ) = cos(θs) and cos(θir ) = cos(θr).

We thus ﬁnd that the j = 0 rotor state does not couple to the ripplons, while the j = 1
state does.

In order to calculate matrix elements of the interaction, we need to determine the di-
mensionless amplitude for the ripplon vibrations. Using the methods presented in Lamb’s
text [33], we can determine the eﬀective mass, µ(Ls), for each ripplon:

µ(Ls) =

MHe ρ R3
Ls

Note that the eﬀective mass is proportional to the total mass of the cluster, not the mass
of atoms near the surface. This is due to the fact that the surface waves have a velocity
ﬁeld that goes into the bulk of the cluster, with the velocity proportional to yLs−1. Surface
waves of higher Ls values are increasingly conﬁned to motion of atoms closer to the surface,
and thus have a reduced eﬀective mass. Using this relationship, we can write the surface
displacement in terms of raising and lowering operators for the ripplons (a†(Ls, Ms) and
a(Ls, Ms)) as follows:

δr(θs, ϕs) =

S(Ls, Ms)YLs,Ms(θs, ϕs)

Despite the fact that the integral diverges as y

·
1, the coupling matrix elements
diagonal in rotational quantum numbers are much less than the spacing between ripplon
states for the range of y that includes most of the probability density of the impurity.
Since the coupling is linear in the ripplon coordinates (which are harmonic oscillators),
Hripplon,rotation has no ﬁrst order contribution to the energy. This suggests that we can treat
this coupling by second order perturbation theory to account for the virtual creation and
annihilation of ripplons as an impurity rotates. A consequence of the linear ripplon coupling
is that this second order correction is independent of the occupation of the ripplon modes!
Such coupling shifts the equilibrium position of the ripplons from zero displacement but
does not change their force constant. We ﬁnd a shift in energy equal to:

If we select the z axis as along the vector from the center of the cluster to the impurity
center of mass, then only the Ms = 0 terms contribute to the sum.

The above expression was used to calculate the shift in the energy of the j = 1, mj = 0
level as a function of y. The integrals over θs were performed numerically using Gauss–
Legendre integration. The shift for the two j = 1, mj =
1 levels will be just one quarter
as large. Figure IX shows the calculated shift divided by Planck’s constant as a function of
a, along with a plot of the radial distribution function for the impurity. This was calculated
from the isotropic, C60, interaction energy, as described above.
It can be seen that the
ripplon induced shift is completely negligible except for the extreme tail of the Boltzmann
distribution. We can conclude that the potential interaction of the impurity rotation with
the ripplons can be neglected compared to the position dependent anisotropic dispersion
interaction.

VI. HYDRODYNAMIC COUPLING OF IMPURITY MOTIONS

While the motions of the impurity in the superﬂuid He are expected to be without
friction, the medium does exert an inﬂuence by hydrodynamic eﬀects. The reason is that as
the impurity rotates or translates, He atoms must move out of the way to avoid the short
range repulsion. For a spherical impurity, the eﬀect of the He kinetic energy produced by the

16

impurity translational motion can be modeled by an eﬀective mass for the impurity that is
increased by 0.5 times the mass of He displaced by the impurity. For an anisotropic impurity,
there is in addition both a hydrodynamic contribution to the eﬀective moment of inertia
for rotation, and a coupling between rotation and center of mass motion. In this section a
detailed calculation of these eﬀects will be presented. This type of coupling was previously
discussed (though developed in much less detail) in a paper by Elser and Platzman, who
proposed an anisotropic solvation structure around positive ions in bulk liquid He to explain
an observed temperature dependence to the eﬀective mass of ions [34].

The hydrodynamic coupling of translation and rotation does not occur for an impurity
with tetrahedral or octahedral symmetry [33]. Let us model the impurity molecule as a rigid,
symmetric ellipsoid of principal axes a = b = 3.2˚A and c = ξa = 3.7˚A. These parameters are
based upon the position of the inner wall in the He–HCN potential of Atkins and Hutson [19].
Since the dominant hydrodynamic eﬀect is for parts of the ﬂuid close to the moving body, the
use of a continuum, incompressible ﬂuid model is a questionable approximation. However,
because of its simplicity, it is worth working out in detail the predictions of this model.
Further, it may be the case that the form of the resulting hamiltonian may be more generally
applicable than the simple hydrodynamic model used to derive it.

The motion of an ellipsoid in an incompressible ﬂuid without viscosity is worked out in
the text by Milne-Thomson [35]. The hydrodynamic kinetic energy is given for an ellipsoid
moving in any direction relative to its principal axes. ~v denotes the velocity of the ellipsoid
relative to the ﬂuid at large distance from the ellipsoid; ~λ denotes a unit vector in the
direction of the unique principal axis; M ′ = MHe ρ 4
3 π a3 ξ is the mass of He displaced by
the ellipsoid (34.6 u for the HCN–He parameters given above), and M the mass of the
ellipsoid. The classical kinetic energy of translational motion of the ellipsoid is:

for a very prolate ellipsoid (ξ
0),
for a ﬂat disk. For our model of HCN in He, ξ = 1.16, and we have α1 = 0.419
i.e.
and γ1 = 0.544. The coupling of ~λ and ~v reﬂects the fact that it takes less energy (at
ﬁxed velocity) to move the ellipsoid though the ﬂuid with its long principal axis aligned
with the ﬂow, then with this axis perpendicular to the ﬂow. This leads to coupling of
the rotational motion to the translational motion.
In the bulk, the rotational axis will
precess about the velocity vector, and this would be expected to produce re–orientational
dephasing of a molecular ro–vibrational absorption line, since there is a distribution of
molecular translational velocity.

For the case of HCN, AH = 0.036. The j = 0

spectral lineshapes for the R(0) and R(2) transitions after averaging over the Maxwell–
Boltzmann distribution for Etrans. The horizontal axis is in units of AHkbTch−1 which equals
283 MHz for the case of HCN. The spectra have a cusp in the center due to the √Etrans
factor in the density of states. The higher frequency lobe arises from parallel transitions and
the lower lobe, the perpendicular transitions (relative to the impurity momentum vector).
Note that molecules with the projection of the rotational angular momentum perpendicular
to the center of mass momentum are higher in energy than those with rotational angular

momentum either parallel or antiparallel to the linear momentum. This is because in the
constant momentum case, orientations with the linear molecule axis parallel to the linear
momentum are higher in energy, due to the lower eﬀective mass for that orientation.

Explicit expressions for the matrix elements of the hydrodynamic term can be derived
from the relationships from the matrix elements of ~λ
operating on the spherical harmonics,
as given by Rose [36]. After considerable algebra, the matrix elements diagonal in j in the
coupled representation (where L is the center of mass motion orbital angular momentum
quantum number, j the quantum number of rotation of the linear impurity, and J the
quantum number for the total angular momentum of the impurity),

Using this hamiltonian, the j = 0

1 spectrum of HCN in a He cluster can be recal-
culated. Figure IX shows the spectrum calculated including the isotropic (C60) term in the
potential and the hydrodynamic coupling, but without the anisotropic potential term (C62)
for a cluster of R = 3 nm. The calculated spectrum of the impurity in the cluster looks
remarkably like that (see Figure IX) for a linear molecule impurity in bulk liquid He, except
the spectrum is ‘inverted’. This can be understood as a consequence of averaging over the
classical trajectory of the motion, which is in a plane perpendicular to L. For circular orbits,
this leads to the prediction that the j = 1 state with mj = 0 is higher in energy than the
CH)MeﬀEk/5¯h2, where Ek is the average
states with mj =
kinetic energy for the center of mass motion. Using the thermal RMS kinetic energy, this
gives a predicted average splitting of
150 MHz. This naturally explains the shape of the
predicted spectrum and the energy scale.

Figure IX shows the calculated cluster spectrum for the HCN R(0) line including both
the anisotropic potential term and the hydrodynamic coupling. Somewhat surprisingly, the
spectrum is narrower than for the case of either coupling term by itself. The reason is that
for the dominant ∆L = 0 matrix elements, the two sets of matrix elements destructively
interfere. This is despite the fact that the two coupling terms are complementary in that
the hydrodynamic coupling is most important when the impurity is near the center of the
cluster (and thus has the highest velocity), while the potential anisotropy is most important
at the outer turning point of the motion. The quantitative eﬀect of this interference on
the predicted spectrum will be a strong function of the particular parameters used in the
calculation, including the cluster size.

VII. APPLICATION TO THE R(0) TRANSITION OF OCS

We will now consider the application of the present model to the case of OCS as an
impurity, partly because of the elegant studies of the spectrum of this molecule performed
in G¨ottingen, and also because it has the narrowest lines presently observed for an impurity
in 4He clusters [8]. In fact, the linewidths estimated above for the R(0) transition of HCN,
while being well below that observed in the R(0) transition HCN in the ﬁrst C–H overtone
band, are similar to that of the R(0) line of the OCS ν3 fundamental. This suggests that
the present model may be more accurate in this case.

At the author’s request, Joanna Howson and Jeremy Hutson have calculated long range

coeﬃcients for the He–OCS pair [37]. They ﬁnd C60 = 14.2 eV˚A

and C73 = 13.9 eV˚A
. Calculations were done with a number of basis sets, but
the above results were done with a Dunning augmented–cc–pVTZ basis and are reported
to have
10% uncertainty. The calculations use SCF polarizabilities and employed the
CADPAC6.3 program package.

, C62 = 2.44 eV˚A

≈

In the present paper, we will continue to use only the lowest order, C6, terms, though the
type of scaling done above indicates that the C71 term may make a substantial contribution
in the present case. Higgins and Klemperer [38] have calculated a series of points on the
He–OCS surface at the MP4 level of theory, which they kindly made available to the author.
From the position of the minimum as a function of angle between the He–OCS vector and
the OCS molecular axis, we approximate the molecule as an ellipsoid with a = b = 3.4 ˚A
and c = 4.7 ˚A, or ξ = 1.38.

Figure IX shows the R(0) transition of OCS observed in 4He clusters, as reported by
Grebenev et al. [14]. It has a FWHM of 150 MHz, and is asymmetric with a broad shoulder
going to lower frequencies. Also in Figure IX is plotted the R(0) transition for OCS, pre-
dicted from the above parameters, and convoluted with a Lorentzian of 30 MHz FWHM to
wash out most of the ﬁne structure in the predicted spectrum. This is justiﬁed both because
we expect vibrational and rotational relaxation lifetime to broaden the lines, and because
the average over the cluster size distribution should at least partially wash out the high res-
olution structure. The agreement with experiment is remarkable, especially considering the
uncertainty in the parameters going into the model. The calculated linewidth is somewhat
too small, but the shape of the peak is in excellent agreement with what was observed in
the experiment.

This level of agreement is highly suggestive that the interactions included in the present
model are the principal source of line broadening in the OCS R(0) transition. However,
it must be noted that the experiments have shown that the linewidth of the ro–vibrational
lines increases dramatically with J, with the R(0) line being the narrowest. While the author
has not calculated lineshapes for higher J transitions because of memory limitations on the
personal computer on which these calculations have been performed, it is likely that the
present model will not predict an increase in linewidth with J, but will more likely predict
the opposite. Also the experiments show a signiﬁcant diﬀerence in linewidth for the R(0)
and P(1) lines, which should have the same lineshape (except for an inversion) in the present
model, and in fact any model that does not include a vibrational dependence to the He–
impurity interaction. We conclude that while the interactions considered in this paper likely
play an important role in the lineshape of the R(0) transition, as yet unidentiﬁed interactions
also play an important role, especially at higher J.

VIII. HYDRODYNAMIC CONTRIBUTION TO THE EFFECTIVE MOMENT OF
INERTIA

Let us now consider the hydrodynamic eﬀect on the eﬀective moment of inertia for rota-
tion of our symmetric top impurity. It has been established experimentally that molecules
rotate in liquid He clusters with an eﬀective rotational constant that is smaller than that
of the same molecule in the gas phase. This implies an increase in the eﬀective moment of

21

≈

inertia for rotation. For light impurities with large rotational constants, fractional change of
the rotational constants is small. For example, in the case of H2O, the rotational constants
in the cluster are almost identical with the gas phase [9]. In contrast, heavy impurities with
small gas phase rotational constants, such as (CH3)3SiCCH have a rotational constant in
the cluster of only
20% as large as in the gas phase [4]. Some reduction in rotation con-
stant is expected because of hydrodynamic eﬀects, i.e., He must move out of the way of the
rotating impurity, which contributes to the kinetic energy. Using the model of the impurity
as an ellipsoid, we can directly calculate this increased moment of inertia from the size and
shape of the molecule. The velocity potential for such motion is given by Milne-Thomson.
Only an integral over the surface of the ellipsoid is needed to calculate the hydrodynamic
contribution to the rotational kinetic energy. This leads to the following result for the hy-
drodynamic contribution to the moment of inertia for rotation about the axis perpendicular
to the symmetry axis of the ellipsoid:

rcom is the displacement of the impurity center of mass from the geometric center of the
ellipsoid and I ′ is the value of IB for the ellipsoid if ﬁlled with liquid He and this provides
the natural scale for the eﬀect. The other symbols are as deﬁned above. Figure IX shows a

plot of ∆(ξ) as a function of ξ. For ξ
As an application of this expression, we will again consider OCS. Using the parameters
that a = b = 3.4˚A and c = 4.7˚A estimated from the ab initio points [38], and rcom = 0.1˚A,
2
the calculated enhancement of the B moment of inertia is 9.33 u˚A
, compared to a value of

IB = 83.1 u˚A
, or a predicted rotational constant of OCS in the cluster of 90% of the gas
phase value. This is a small fraction of the observed reduction in B, where the observed B
value in He clusters is 36% of the gas phase B value [8].

Another model for the reduction of rotational constants is to assume a solvation shell of
He atoms that rotate with the impurity. In the case of SF6, such a model seems to naturally
explain the observed reduction in B [3], but does not naturally explain the observed value
of the A rotational constant for (SF6)2 [8], which by such a model would be expected to be
at least 1/2 of the B value for the SF6 monomer in the cluster, while the observed value
(based upon a spectral ﬁt) is less than 1/4. In their recent paper on OCS in mixed 3He
and 4He clusters, Grebenev et al.
[6] propose a model for the eﬀective rotational constants
of impurities in He with a position dependent normal ﬂuid density around the impurity
that rotates with it and thus contributes to the moment of inertia. However, they give
no microscopic description of how this normal fraction could be deﬁned, nor how it could
be measured, thus this model appears to lack empirical content at least until it is more
precisely deﬁned. It is interesting to point out in this context that previous fully quantum
microscopic calculations have found that He atoms in the ﬁrst solvation shell about SF6
participate in exchange and are thus part of the superﬂuid [39]. These authors did ﬁnd that
at 0.625 K the superﬂuid fraction in a SF6He39, 0.67(7), was less than previously calculated
for a He64 cluster, 0.9(1). It would be interesting for these calculations to be repeated for

22

larger He clusters (at least enough to ‘ﬁll’ the second solvation shell around the SF6), and
at a temperature near that found for experimental clusters in order to make better contact
with the presently available spectroscopic experiments.

IX. SUMMARY

In this paper, we have considered the energetics and dynamics for the motion of impu-
rities in spherical liquid 4He clusters, which are treated as superﬂuid liquid droplets. It is
found that the eﬀective potential for motion of the impurity is determined by the long range
part of the impurity–He interaction. The isotropic part ‘traps’ the impurity near the center
of the cluster. The anisotropic part results in a coupling of the rotation and center of mass
motion of the impurity, which leads to inhomogeneous broadening in the predicted IR and
microwave spectra. Calculated broadening values are on the order of 0.1–1 GHz, on the
order of the narrowest lines observed in IR spectroscopy of impurities in liquid He. Hydro-
dynamic eﬀects are also found to play an important role by coupling molecular rotation to
the velocity of center of mass motion. The inhomogeneous spectral eﬀects of the distribu-
tion of thermally excited ripplons are found to be much smaller and are likely negligible in
determining linewidths, though they likely play an important role in determining the time
required for the impurity and cluster to come into equilibrium. Direct hydrodynamic eﬀects
are found to make a minor contribution to the dramatic reductions in eﬀective rotational
constants often found for impurity species in He cluster spectroscopy.

This work will surely not be the last word on this subject. The interactions considered
here, while certainly present, do not appear to be suﬃciently strong to explain the observed
linewidths of many impurities, such as SF6 and HCN. This suggest other, perhaps more
subtle, physical eﬀects are playing a role. New nonlinear spectroscopic experiments that
use either pump–probe methods and/or spectral hole burning are clearly needed to sort out
homogeneous and inhomogeneous eﬀects in He cluster spectroscopy and to provide critical
tests of simple models. Microscopic theory will also surely play an important role in helping
to sort out the various physical eﬀects that can play a role.

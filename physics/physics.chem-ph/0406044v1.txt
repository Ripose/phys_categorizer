Atomic motions and energetics for a phosphate transfer reaction catalyzed by the cAMP-
dependent protein kinase (PKA) are calculated by plane-wave density functional theory, starting
from structures of proteins crystallized in both the reactant conformation (RC) and the transition-
state conformation (TC). In the TC, we calculate that the reactants and products are nearly isoen-
ergetic with a 0.2 eV barrier; while phosphate transfer is unfavorable by over 1.2 eV in the RC, with
an even higher barrier. With the protein in the TC, the motions involved in reaction are small,
with only Pγ and the catalytic proton moving more than 0.5 ˚A. Examination of the structures
reveals that in the RC the active site cleft is not completely closed and there is insuﬃcient space
for the phosphorylated serine residue in the product state. Together, these observations imply that
the phosphate transfer reaction occurs rapidly and reversibly in a particular conformation of the
protein, and that the reaction can be gated by changes of a few tenths of an ˚A in the catalytic site.

INTRODUCTION

Protein kinases regulate many biological processes by
transferring a phosphate group from adenosine triphos-
phate (ATP) to the sidechains of particular serine, threo-
nine, or tyrosine residues. The bulky, charged phosphate
group alters the conformation and function of the tar-
get protein [1, 2]. Diﬀerent kinases recognize diﬀerent
primary sequence motifs surrounding the residue to be
phosphorylated, in a highly regulated fashion [3, 4, 5, 6].
Structural studies have revealed several conformational
changes, such as closing of the active-site cleft, the pack-
ing of the activation loop, and rotation of the C-helix,
which are often implicated in controlling the activity of
protein kinases [2]. The reasons for such control are clear,
but no answer has been provided to such questions as:
“How closed is closed?”, or “is this particular conforma-
tion of the activation loop ‘good enough’ for phospho-
rylation to occur?” Quantum chemistry is required to
objectively answer these questions.

The extent of conformational heterogeneity in a cova-
lent protein reaction was ﬁrst quantiﬁed in a series of
experiments monitoring the temperature-dependent re-
binding of CO to myoglobin after ﬂash photolysis [7].
Agmon and Hopﬁeld created a concise phenomenologi-
cal model describing this situation, using transition state
theory to describe the vibrational reaction, and a dif-
fusive coordinate which describes the protein conforma-
tion and modulates the reaction barrier to the vibrational
transition [8, 9]. Moving beyond the phenomenological
model requires specifying both the conformational het-
erogeneity and the sensitivity of the reaction barrier to
this heterogeneity. Careful structural analysis [10] and
quantum chemistry calculations [11] showed that the re-
action barrier heterogeniety is indeed a reasonable conse-
quence of observed structural heterogeniety at the myo-
globin active site. A reevaluation of a wide variety of

myoglobin data also shows that a distinction between
diﬀusive, solvent-controlled conformational motions and
Arrhenius transitions which are independent of the sol-
vent dynamics is well supported by experiments [12].

In this work, we explore the conformational sensitivity
of the protein kinase reaction in two experimentally de-
termined structures of PKA, one crystallized with ATP
and the protein kinase inhibitor (PKI), which we refer
to as the reactant conformation of PKA, or RC [13].
The other conformation is obtained by crystalizing with
a transition-state analogue, a non-reactive ADP-AlF3
and a mimic of PKI which is both shorter and has a
phosphate-accepting serine instead of an inert alanine at
the reactive position [14]. We refer to the protein confor-
mation in this case as the transition state conformation
of PKA, or TC. Although diﬀerences in conformation
between the two structures are ∼ 0.5 ˚A, we ﬁnd qual-
itatively diﬀerent energetics of reaction, which lead us
to conclude that conformational motion of the protein
kinase is rate-limiting to the overall phosphate transfer
reaction.

METHODS

Initial equilibrium geometries are generated from the
protein data bank entries 1ATP, (RC) and 1L3R, (TC),
both crystal structures of PKA. Initial guesses for the
complete reactant and product structures were obtained
by homology-modeling the terminal phosphate of ATP
(Pγ) and side chains of the serine and catalytic aspartic
acid (D-166) into appropriate positions. All atoms which
were modeled in this way were allowed to move in subse-
quent geometry optimization steps. Four diﬀerent model
sizes, containing 82, 88, 244 and 263 atoms, were con-
structed. The 82-atom minimal system has been deﬁned
by Valiev et al. [15], and includes the Mg2-tri phosphate

and its immediate interaction partners, G-52, S-53, K-
72, D-166, K-168, N-171, D-184, and the substrate serine
residue. Two water molecules from the crystal struc-
ture are included to complete the six-fold coordination
of Mg in the 88-atom system. The 244-atom system con-
tains a signiﬁcantly larger shell around the reaction cen-
ter and more of the ATP molecule (including part or
all of residues G-52, S-53, F-54, K-72, D-166, L-167, K-
168, P-169, E-170, N-171, D-184, F-185, G-186, and the
substrate backbone from residue 18 to 22). The atomic
coordinates of backbone carbon and nitrogen atoms for
each system were taken directly from the experimental
crystal structures. Non-backbone bond lengths and most
angles are derived from amino acid templates to facilitate
comparison of energies between structures. Protons were
added where needed. Residues were truncated by replac-
ing carbon atoms with protons and adjusting the new
C-H bond length accordingly. Full atomic coordinates
are provided in the supporting material.

Atomic interactions are described by the VASP density
functional theory (DFT) and a plane waves basis [16, 17].
Ultrasoft pseudopotentials of the Vanderbilt form [18],
and a PW91 generalized gradient approximation func-
tional are used. A 270 eV plane wave cutoﬀ, appropri-
ate for the pseudopotentials, is applied. This cutoﬀ was
increased to 300 eV to verify insensitivity of results to
choice of basis set. The reaction pathways are computed
with periodic images separated by at least an 8 ˚A vac-
uum layer. A periodic box size of 19 × 21 × 16 ˚A3 is used
for the 82- and 88-atom clusters, 20 × 24 × 21 ˚A3 for the
244-atom cluster and 27 × 24 × 23 ˚A3 for the 263 atoms
structure.

Reactant and product geometries are calculated by op-
timizing the geometry of the clusters with a conjugate
gradients algorithm. Saddle points connecting these sta-
ble geometries were found using the nudged elastic band
(NEB) method [19]. In this method, images are gener-
ated by linear interpolation between the optimized reac-
tant and product structures, and DFT is used to calcu-
late forces on each atom of each image. The images are
then geometry optimized subject to harmonic forces be-
tween the images which force them to be equally spaced
along a minimum energy pathway between reactants and
products. The climbing image modiﬁcation to the NEB
method [20, 21] was used so that the highest energy im-
age along the band converges directly to the saddle point,
thus increasing the accuracy of the energy barrier with
fewer images. Reﬁnements to the barriers for small sys-
tem changes were computed with the dimer saddle point
ﬁnding method [22].

The 82-atom system contains the same 59 uncon-
strained atoms as Valiev et al., while the waters added
to make the 88-atom system were allowed to move. The
244-atom system has only 42 moving atoms (the gamma
phosphate, Mg1, Mg2, their coordinated water, and the
sidechains of S-21, D-166, and K-168).

2

In order to test the sensitivity of the 244-atom result
to system size changes and details of the electrostatic
boundary conditions and periodic box size, we added the
adenosine ring to make a 263 atom system, and observed
changes to the barrier for TC of less than 15 meV.

RESULTS

conformational dependence

Fig. 1a shows the energetics of the 244-atom systems.
The reaction is endothermic in RC by 1.2 eV, while in
TC, the reaction is nearly isoenergetic with a barrier of
only 0.20 eV. The reaction pathway of TC, shown in Fig.
1b, shows only small motions during the reaction; only
two atoms move more than 0.5 ˚A, and the catalytic base
moves only 0.07 ˚A. Apparently, in the TC structure, the
atoms around the active site are correctly arranged for
both the reactants and products state. In contrast, 1.2
eV endothermicity in RC indicates sub-optimal geome-
tries in the product state.

At the transition state, the PγO3 has a planar conﬁgu-
ration, halfway between the ADP and the serine Oγ, and
proton transfer from the serine to the Asp-166 occurs af-
ter the phosphate transfer. Transferring the proton to
an oxygen atom on the Pγ phosphate was found to be
unfavorable by more than 0.5 eV. These observations are
in agreement with previous DFT studies [15].

One possibile spurious origin for the low barrier in TC
is that both the reactants and products are destabilized
because the active site has collapsed around the AlF3,
just as we expect RC to be energetically biased towards
the reactants. Two observations force us to the conclu-
sion that this is not occuring.

Examination of the reaction pathway geometries re-
veals two clear reasons for the endothermicity in the TC
structure. First, the reaction cleft in RC is approximately
1 ˚A more open in RC than in TC, so the protein is un-
able to maintain the full octahedral coordination of both
magnesium ions in the products state. Fig. 2 shows this
distance between the N-171 oxygen and the closest Pβ
oxygen to be 5.1 ˚A in the RC conformer.
In the TC
structure, the reaction center is compressed, reducing
this distance to 4.2 ˚A. Second, it appears that there is
more space for the phosphorylated serine residue in TC
than RC.

Fig. 1a maintains the relative energies of RC and TC,
and shows that TC is only 160 meV higher than RC. The
errors contributing to this diﬀerence are likely several
tenths of an eV, but it is gratifying that the reactants
energies are so similar in the two conformations.

reactants state) causes only one third of the diﬀerence in
the distance shown in Fig. 2 to dissappear, even with no
solvent present and every atom in the protein allowed to
move during the optimization.

Second, Table I, shows much smaller motions are
needed for reaction in TC than in RC. The Mg++ ions,
coordinated water molecules, catalytic base, and lysine
all move ∼ 0.1 ˚A in TC, and 0.5 to 1.0 ˚A in RC. Even
the serine residue, which gains a phosphate group, moves
only a quater ˚A during the course of reaction. A re-
lated observation is that the change in force on the frozen
atoms during reaction is about half as large for TC than
RC (not shown).

To directly check the eﬀect of constraint on the results,
and guided by knowlege of the forces on frozen atoms, we
relieved the constraint on the beta phosphate of ATP.
The relative energy of RC and TC went up by 350 meV,
while the maximum change in force dropped by a factor
of ten, and was uniformily distributed across a dozen
boundary atoms. The exothermicities of RC and TC
changed by less than 0.1 eV, while optimal geometries
diﬀered by ∼ 0.1 ˚A, suggesting that the templates used to
build the Mg-triphosphate coordination sphere diﬀered
from the quantum mechanical potential by ∼ 0.1 ˚A in
several places.

The conclusion that TC provides a structure with
happy reactants as well as the potential to create happy
products with minimal motions is robust.

dependence on system size

Valiev et al. [15] reported a barrier of 0.5 eV for this
reaction, when using either a GGA or B3LYP functional
and local basis set on an 82-atom version of the RC struc-
ture, with only a pair of atoms ﬁxed at the boundary
of each molecular fragment. This result is intermedi-
ate between our RC and TC results, and could indicate

and TC conformers. With the additional constraining atoms,
the RC reaction becomes very unfavorable, while the TC con-
formation phosphorylates. (b) Reaction path for phosphate
transfer in PKA for a 244-atom TC structure. The additional
constraining atoms on the outside of the cluster, as compared
to the 82-atom system in Fig. 3(a), reduce spurious motion
during the reaction. For example, the central Mg2+ ion re-
mains in place with the proper coordination throughout this
reaction.

geometry constraints

Another question arises from the relatively small set
of moving atoms allowed in the calculation shown in Fig.
1. One might expect the geometry-optimized reaction
pathway to be independent of initial conformation in the
limit of the entire protein being allowed to move. Several
observations force us to the conclusion that this is not
correct.

First, energetic minimization of both RC and TC to-
wards the reactants state, using a classical molecular dy-
namics potential (which should be perfectly valid for the

4

FIG. 2: The 82-atom system in the TC structure has a lower
barrier than the RC structure and a favorable product state
because the reaction center is compressed.
In the product
and transition states, the central Mg atom can remain octa-
hedrally coordinated in the TC conformer. In the RC con-
former the reaction cleft is opened and the same Mg atom is
forced to break one bond, making the reaction unfavorable.
The distance between the coordinating oxygen atoms on the
Asn171 and ADP groups, which is a measure of reaction cen-
ter size, is increased from 4.3 ˚A in the TC structure to 5.0 ˚A
in the RC structure.

computational details provide variability as large as the
conformational diﬀerences which we cite.

To check this posibility, we duplicated their 82-atom
system and choice of constraints, and show the results of
our calculation in Fig. 3, for both RC and TC. Consis-
tent with their result, we ﬁnd a 0.5 eV barrier and an
exothermicity of 0.2 eV in the RC, indicating a robust-
ness of the result to the various truncation proceedures,
basis sets, periodic boundary conditions, and functionals
used the calculations. Unfortunately, the result is also
insensitive to the starting conformation of the protein, in
contrast to the results on the 244-atom systems.

Table I shows that the motions of the atoms are much
larger than in the 244-atom calculation, and compari-
sion of Figs. 1b and 3b shows a qualitatively larger and
more contorted reaction dynamics in the smaller system.
Further reﬂection suggests that atoms are moving that
would not be able to in the complete protein system, for
example the Mg2+ ions. We tested this by adding two
crystallographic water molecules to Mg1, and observing
the reaction to become endothermic by ∼ 0.5 eV. Clearly,
the 82-atom system is under-constrained because it is not
large enough to provide accurate energetics of the relative
reaction rate of the two systems.

A potentially very useful observation is that the geome-
tries of reaction in the 82-atom calculation for both con-
formations share several similarities with the 244-atom
TC calculation. This suggests that the underconstrained
calculations can oﬀer useful clues as to which conforma-

tions will favor reaction.

An energetic oﬀset of 400 meV has been subtracted
from TC for ease of comparison of the barrier and
exothermicity to RC. Although we do not place great
conﬁdence in this number, it in interesting to note that
the additional interactions included in the 244-atom sys-
tem stabilize the reactive conformation of the protein.

DISCUSSION

Much has been written about the reaction dynamics
problem [23, 24, 25, 26], but it is primarily concerned
with the very diﬃcult problem of combining the vibra-
tional transition with solvent motions. These ideas lead
to something like [27], which does not make use of the
separation of energy scales which comes from understand-
ing protein dynamics, per se, and does not provide modu-
larity of the diﬀerent aspects of the calculation (quantum
mechanical, hydration, and conformational motions.) By
allowing relatively few atoms to move, we increase the
probability that the dynamics of traversing our zero-
temperature pathway will be simple enough to occur
quickly. The formalism of Agmon and Hopﬁeld can then
be used to relate the vibrational transition to an overall
reaction rate.

The current calculations are evaluated in the context
of the Agmon-Hopﬁeld model in Figure 4a, which shows
the 1ATP (RC) structure at the peak of a distribution
of conformations and 1L3R (TC) at the side. Figure 4b
shows the barrier computed in the two calculations — 60
kBT for the reactant conformer and 6 kBT for the transi-
tion conformer. Figure 4c shows the reaction ﬂux across
the barrier as a function of protein conformation, simply
the product of the probability of a conformation with the
rate of reaction for that conformation g (cc) k (cc), where
k (cc) = exp [−H (cc) /kBT ].

This model provides an estimate of the distance-scale
over which the barrier changes can be made by com-
bining the information in Figs. 2 and 4c, which shows
that a 0.9 ˚A shift in the Mg2+ position, combined with
several other changes of a similar size shifts the barrier
by 50 kBT . Thus, a reasonable ﬂux is conﬁned to a
multi-dimensional region only ∼ 0.2 ˚A wide! Allostery is
the property by which small molecules or proteins bind-
ing distant from the active site can inﬂuence activity by
changing the protein conformation; the present calcula-
tion shows that these changes can be quite sublte.

The exact value of the reaction rate requires knowl-
ege of the conformational occupancy of the low-barrier
conformation, which we have not attempted to calculate
in this work. There is a need for methods that can ex-
plore conformational changes in proteins. In this regard,
inspection of the calculation in Fig. 3 can be quite help-
ful in discovering what conformations to look for when
screening an MD simulation to ﬁnd the correct portion
of conformation space.

A recent crystal structure of a Y204A mutation of PKA
in complex with a peptide inhibitor supports two aspects
of our calculation [28]. First, a mixture of reactants
and products can co-exist, and second, very few residues
move in the course of the phosphate transfer. Yang et
al. speciﬁcally note the absence of motion in the Mg++
ions, coordinated water, K168, and S53 [28].

CONCLUSIONS

Two important lessons can be learned from this work.
First, approximately 200 atoms need to be included to
obtain the correct electronic structure, and also main-
tain enough constraints on the boundary conditions to
meaningfully reproduce the eﬀect of protein conforma-
tion on reaction rate. Second is the existance of the zero-
temperature pathway in this particular case. In proteins
where it is not possible to obtain TC crystal structures,
it is essential to ﬁnd appropriate methods to explore the
variety of protein conformational motions. Since protein
motions typically occur on timescales ranging from hun-
dreds of nanoseconds to microseconds, it is unlikely that
simple embedding of the quantum region in a larger clas-
sical region will resolve this diﬃculty.

Is ab-initio quantum chemistry now in a position to
answer the biologically motivated questions posed in the
introduction? It is clear, at least, that the active site
cleft is not closed far enough in the RC structure. On
the other hand, the real power of these techniques will
only become evident when it is possible to thouroughly
sample conformational motions of proteins and protein
